â¢ STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 28.â After Mr.
Reed Had found at Los Angeles Park a
good Republican and sound-money Demo
cratic quorum he was waited upon at his
noms in the Westminster Hotel by a com
mittee from San Francisco, Alameda,
..Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties and
taken -to the dining-room of the California
â¢Club, where the humble hospitality of the
Golden Sate was dispensed in that feeble
'not-bird and champaign-frappe way for
â¢ Which California has become noted.
At the table were seated with him Judge
Enoch. Knight, a sound-money Democrat
:qf Lbs Angeles, Senator J. F. Aldrich, W.
M. Rank, Charles M. Shortridge, Dr. James
'Berry, J. J-. Byrne, F. W. V*n Sicklen. Dr.
' W: G: Cochrane. Eli S. Denison, Hervev
Lindley, -H. Z. Osborne and George H.
Stewart. "
â¢ ' 'The . subject of conversation was any
thin? and everything but politics, and
'was of the humorous order.
After dinner Mr. Reed, with the com
ptexion of a man who knows a good thing
wh'en he eats it, repaired to the park, said
."his farewell in a few characteristic sen
tences and went on board the Pullman
boudoir car Coronet, not an inappropriate
name, by the way, for the man who In
sisted when be saw a quorum before him
.that that quorum was present whether it
answered the rollcall or not.
. Mr. Reed was fatigued and drew the
curtains of his couch around him early,
;/and when daybreak broke out of a clear,
dry sky, the train was bowling lazily
: along through, tha tunnels and rocky
. Blopes of the Tehachapi Mountains. Not*
â¢ withstanding the earliness of the hour, at
least 100 voters were standing in front of
'the Ba'kersneld depot when the train
rolled by, and they sent up thr^e hearty
.cheers.' The man from Maine heard them
cenfhsedly in his gleep, and dreamed that
jt was the day after election and that the
United States were shouting for joy be
cause" McKinley had been chosen Presi
dent" ami that prosperity had come to
them again.
He was up and dressed when Tulare was
readied, and found the depot platform
crowded with men and women wearing
yellow rib Dons and mammoth chrysan
themums of golden hue. The boudoir
car was easily picked out, because of the
wide window in the middle and the small
American 9ag hanging from it on the in
feide. Mr. Reed had not put on his black
slouch hat, and his bald head was in
puris naturalibus, without even a toupee
made in Paris, and he was immediately
recognized with a cheer so stentorian
that what was iefi unpicked of the second
crop of muscats was shaken bodily off the
vines.
A slop was made at Fresno at half-past
8 for breakfast, and the Coronet was bur- ]
rounded by a crowd of about 1000 persons j
wearing the orange ribbon of protection to i
home industry and good yellow money for
the wages of home labor. A mighty cheer
vent up as the train halted at the depot,
and Mr. Reed was obliged to loom on
the rear platform, wearing that shockingly
unfashionable and plebean hatâ such a one
as he wore in the good old homely days
when he taught school in our own Stock
The Old Brick Schoolhouse in Stockton in Which Thomas B. Reed, Now of the United States
House of Representatives* Used to Demand a Quorum of Pupils Every Morning.

ton and smiled at the bie girls when they
recited their lessons well.
His speech was of less than half a dozen
sentences and simply conveyed his thanks
for the kind appreciation of his fellow
' citizens. Then he took off that horrible
, hat and bowed and smiled, and another
j big cheer went up when the crowd saw
| that jolly face and the bald head shining
with good nature.
At Modesto, which up to a year or two
ago was a heaven for Democrats and a
purgatory tor Republicans, a large crowd
had gathered, and when the train began
j to slow down a brass band marched up to
i Mr. Reed's car, heading a procession of
j 800 or 900 persons. The train tarried here
j for only two or three minutes, and Mr.
Reed sat at the broad window where all
j could get a good view of him.
Tne members of the band were full of
I enthusiasm, for they played fortissimo
! and con spirito some n.usic in which the
bass drum and the cymabls took the lead
ing part It was not a patriotic air â in I
fact, nobody appeared to know what the
tune was â but it was strongly reminiscent
i of that played by a four-piece circus band
! while the well-trained horse is gently lop- j
I ing around the ring carrying upon his
spinal column a barebacked hand-painted
lady balancing herself upon one foot.
Somehow or other the music did not seem
to carry Mr. Reed's mind back to the days
of his boyhood. Perhaps his parents did |
not let him go to the circus and he was
obliged to go to church instead. At any
rate, he looked upon the man with the
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 29, 1896.
UNCLE SAM â FII put a stop to that faker nuisance next week*
bass drum and the cymb.ila with murder
in his eye, and there is no knowing what
might have happened had not the con
ductor shouted "All aboard!" and caused
the passenger to make a frautic dive
through the crowd for the nearest car
steps.
Some 100 severe critics among the pas
sengers thought that the band should
have played "Marching Through Georgia,"
"Maine Is for JucKinley," or something of
that kind, but it was evident that the
band did not propose to work off any
chestnuts on the statesman from Maine,
and preferred to treat him to a simple ex
ercise from Wagner instead.
At Ripon the same thing was observed
with respect to the crowds and the cheer
ing, and when the train reached the quiet
village of Lathrop several hundred per
sons were in waiting with the committee
of reception from Stockton, all wearing
the yellow ribbon. They gave a great
cheer when they saw the little flag that
marked Mr. Reed's car, and they formed
a cordon around it almost as impassable
as a Spanish trocha. The committee of
reception was as big as the new Stockton,
and was composed of her leading business
j and professional men. About half of
them with a delegation from the State of
Maine went to Lathrop to receive the
distinguished guest, and* the remainder
waited at the Stockton depot and im
parted to the surroundings a yellow glare.

Stockton, proud of her former son, wel
comed him home with all the Bigns of
rejoicing. Two thousand people wearing
tho orange badge of good citizenship
crowded the depot platform and cheered
him again and again, and when he stepped
down from the car wearing that old slouch,
twisted and warped and battered, he |
looked so much like a man of the people.
a steady, conservative, take-it-easy Stock
ton man. that they yelled until they were
h.arse. Andy Simpson and General Shep
herd in particular almost ruptured their
lungs shouting for "Tom."
In an open square back of the railway
deDOt bombi were exploded, making a
deafening uproar, while- from the cross
piece of a telecraph pole a long string of
giant firecrackers popped merrily like the
rattle of musketry. Mr. Reed and the
committee which escorted him from Los
Angelesâ Messrs. Eli S. Denison, W. M.
Rank, F. W. Van Sicklen, Senator J. F.
Aldrich and Charles AI. Shortridgeâ to
gether with n delegation from the State of
Maine Association, were taken in four
open carriages to the Imperial Hotel, a
block away, amid the plaudits of the
assembled multitude. After shaking
hands with the representative n;en of
Stockton with a grip that mpde their
knuckles ache Mr. Reed and party had
lunch aud at 3 o'clock were taken fora
drive around the city and particularly to
theold buildinein which the distinguished
visitor taught school when he was younger
and gloried in a bang.
The building is on Hunter street in the
northwestern part of the city and is the
property of Dr. Clark. It is of brick, with
Basement, mum floor and attic, with a
double-peaked roof and six gables, in a
grove of eucalyptus and oak. A sedate,
coraiortable-lookirg house it is, and has
been used as a residence for many years.
Mr. Reed lingered around the old spot,
the dwelling-place of so many pleasant
memories of the distant past, and when
he turned away he heaved a sigh. This
man. schooled in the subtleties of politics
and bearing upon bis heart and brain the
battle scars of great issues, sighed for the
contentment and quiet that once were his,
and which seem to forsake those who
stand around the throne upon which for
ever beats the fierce white light of fame.
The day's excursion ended with a ride
in the steamboat Clara Crow, down
Stockton Channel to the river bend, at
Rough and Ready Island, celebrated for
its magnificent yield of fruit. Mr. Reed
found that many changes had taken place
since he insisted on a quorum every
morning in the old bricic school. He
admired the Free Public Library building,
with its front of white marble, and the
finest courthouse in the State, a magnifi
cent memorial in granite to the wis-iom
and good taste of San Joaquin's Super
visors. John Paul Cosgrave.
MR. REED'S SPEECH.
Republicanism Founded Upon the
Common-Sense of American
People.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 28â Never be
fore in the history of StocKton has so
much interest in a political gathering
been taken as there was 10-night. During
the afternoon the city began to fill with
visitors, special trains having been run
from Sacramento, Fresno, Oakdale, Mer
ced, lone and other points. These began
to arrive about 5 o'clock in the afternoon,
and the whistling of the locomotives, the
clanging of the bells and the screams of
the factory whistles added to the din that
was made in Stockton shortly before night
closed upon the town.
The night was a beautiful one for such a
demonstration. The sky was clear and
the stars shone like golden buttons in a
McKinley sky. The streets began to till
with people, and long bsfore 7 o'clock the
walks along Main street were crowded.
At that hour the great dome on the court
house leaped into a blaze of mellow light,
for the 1000 incandescent lights that were
placed there for the Native Sons' celebra
tion were turned on and could be seen for
miles away.
It had not been expected that Reed
would arrive until 4 o'clock, and the re
ception arranged for him by the Sons of
Maine had to be foregone. They made
up, however, by their demonstration at
the depot on his arrival and later by
marchm? in a body in (he procession.
The procession began shortly alter 7:30
o'clock, going up Main street to the Im
perial Hotel, where the visitors were
quartered, then back on Main street, cov
ering several blocks along the principal
thoroughfares, and to the pavilion.
The procession was in two divisions, the
first being headed by a cavalcade of 300
horsemen, led by Grand Marshal W. F.
Sibley, Chief Aid Eugene Lehe aud Assist
ant Aid Frank Hill. Then followed the
Sixth Regiment band, the Sons of Maine
club, the Stockton drum corps, McKin

ley and Hobart drill corps, and carriages
containing Speaker Reed, Judge Ansel
Smith, A. W. Simpson and Chairman
Nelson of the County Committee. Next
came a carriage with Miss Reed, Miss
Katherine Cunningham and the Misses
Welch of this city, followed by other dis
tinguished visitors in carriages. This di
vision was made up of the Sacramento
band and uniformed clubs from towns
north of here.
The second division was in command ot
Marshal Arthur H. Ashley, whose aids
were County Assessor Ortman and Charles
L. Neumiller. They were followed by the
Forester's' band, the members of the Me-
Kinley and Hobart Club of this city, clnbs
from south of Stockton, a bicycle brigade
and citizens on foot and in carnages.
Long before the hour for the torchlight
procession to start bombs and anvils were
fired and hundreds of men and boys made
the welkin ring with an assortad aggrega
tion of fish-horns. There was enthusiasm
in the air and it seemed contagious.
The interior of the big Agricultural Pa
vilion had been materially altered for the
occasion. An immense platform had been
erected in the western end for the speaker
of the evening and for the hundred vice
piesidents who were to occupy it with
him. All during the day a committee of
Stockton ladies, composed of Mrs. E. I.
Jones, Mrs. C. E. Littlehale, Mrs. J. W.
Cavis, Mrs. H. G. Shaw, Mrs. Burr, Mrs.
Gillis, Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Anderson, Mrs.
G. S. Blake, Mrs. George Simpson, Mrs.
George A. Gray, Mrs. M. L. Graven, Miss
Westbay, Miss Eva McKenzie and Miss
Atkinson, had been busy transforming
with deft fingers the entrance and front
of the platform into a floral bower.
For sixty feet in front of where Speaker
Reed to-night faced a sea ot upturned
faces were great bunches of ferns, chrys
anthemums and roses, and above his
head in a great floral wreath hung the
picture of McKinley. Around the galler
ies were draped the stars and stripes.
Thousands flocked to the pavilion long
before the parade started, in order to be
certain of getting seats. So great was the
demand tuat some who held special invi
tations to reserved seats were induced to
part with them for coin. The main floor
of the building had been provided with
accommodations for 5000, and the galler
ies had fully as many more. There was
not a single seat to be had for love nor
money long before the entrance of the
speaker was announced. There were over
10,000 people in the pavilion at this time,
and those who delayed to witness the
street parade found it impossible to get
standing room within the big structure.
The ladies of Stockton turned out to hear
the great man from Maine, and many had
to stand in the crowded aisles for hou^s in
order to catch a glimpse of him. To
night's gathering was by far the largest
that has ever assembled in the pavilion
and had the building been twice as large
those who wanted to hear Reed would
have filled it.
On the speaker's arrival the entire as
semblage arose and broke into wild cheer
ing. It was some time before Chairman
Nelson of the County Committee could
force a passage through the throng. As
the man from Maine stepped on the plat
form the cheering was renewed. On the
platform and along the galley rail could

No Doubt That the Demonstration Will
Exceed Anythirg Ever Seen
in the West.
Great progress was made yesterday by
the many committees and sub-committees
having in charge the details of Saturday's
monster parade.
There were, as usual, many busy meet
ings throughout the City, and the marked
feature of all was that the great increase
in tho number of attendants and in their
enthusiasm.
To sum the matter up in a few sentences
there has been progress all along ihe line.
The grand marshal and his clerical assist
ants are simplifying the business details.
The financial committee is raising funds
without trouble, every branch of industry
is falling in line and there is now no doubt
that the parade will eclipse anything ever
witnessed west of Chicago.
As an evidence of the extent of the in
terest it may be stated that Colonel Stone
now believes there will be more than 30,
---000 in line. Twenty-eighi thousand
badges were distributed in a few hours
yesterday and 12, C00 more will be an hand
to-day if the manufacturer can mako
them. All shades of yellow ribbon to be
obtained in San Francisco have been ex
hausted, and badge? are now being made
of yellow silk.
So great has the demand been for musi
cians that no more bands are left in San
Francisco, and various divisions are send
ing to surrounding towns for music.
A noticeable feature of the meetings '
yesterday, particularly of the lawyers'
meeting, was that nearly as many Demo
crats as Republicans were present, enter
ing their emphatic protest against repudi
ation and National dishonor.
The following instructions to division
marshals, chiefs of battalions and com
panies were issued by Colonel Stone yes
terday :
The formation for the marching column on
parade will be a column of sections, each sec
tion containing eight men. Eight files of
men will occupy a distance of about li f teen
feet, and the sections will march eight feet
apart. The man on the left of each section
will ba responsible for the distance and *
alignment. The men of the left of the sec
tions will march directly In rear of tho men
in front of them. The guide will be toward
the leftâ that is, each man will keep touch to
the left.
The distance between companies will not ex
ceed eighteen feet.
The distance between divisions must not ex
ceed sixty feet, allowing ior bauds and mounted
staff.
All companies, battalions ana organizations
will march to their positions in a column of
fours oi eights, and in such column halt at
their proper position and distance. It they
march to position in fours they will at once
upon arrival form into sections of eight, clos
ing up to proper distance.
It is very desirable to preserve the column of
eights or sections during the entire parade,
and if during the long march men aro obliged
to fall out other nies of men will step forward
and fill such places as mar become vacant, it
being very important to preserve a column of
sections (or eight files) and the distance be
tween the ranks.
To form a column of eights from a column
of fours, the No. 1 men of each four count
from the front to rearâ l, 2. 3, 4, 5. etc. The
captain then commands, "Form sections, left
oblique, march!" The odd-numbered fours

Over seventy members of the San Fran
cisco bar, many of them life-iong Dem
ocrats, met yesterday noon in the assem
bly-room of the Mills building to take
preliminary step 3 toward forming a law
yers' division in the McKinley and Hobart
parade on Saturday. William M. Pierson
of the Democratic law firm of Pierson &
Mitchell was elected chairman.
It was unanimously resolved by those
present to join in the parade, the Dem
ocrats being the most enthusiastic of all
the speakers. The following committee,
with Mr. Pierson as chairman, was ap
pointed to canvass for other participants,
for lunds for necessary expenses, and was
empowered to enpage a band, obtain flags
and one or more banners: T. V. O'Brien,
E. D. Sawyer, Charles Page. William
Thomas, C. A. Shurileff, W. H. Beatty,
George H. Mastick. Among those who
snoke was Mr. Highton, another life-long
Democrat, who made a stirring speech for
eound money. Reuben H. Lloyd was
elected grand marshal of the lawyers'
division in the parade. From a paper
signed by the Mills building lawyers alone
soon after the meeting, Chairman Pierson
said yesterday afternoon that he feels
confident that at least 300 or 400 lawyers
will be in line.
The following were appointed a commit
tee of arrangements: William Thomas,
Charlea Page, E. D. Sawyer, George H.
Mastick, T. V. O'Brien and C. A. Shurt
leff.
There were a number of stirring speeches
on the political situation, most of them
by men whose principal objection to
Bryan is that he assails the dignity ana
authority of thp Supreme Court.
Attorney H. E. Highton held that any
attempt to subvert the power of the Su
preme Court was an attack upon the very
foundation principles ol government, and
in his mind this question was paramount
in the present campaign.
Representatives of Eastern railway lines
held an enthusiastic meeting yesterday to
perfect arrangements for the parade.
"It is about the only question," said
Chairman Canfield last night, "that all ot
us ever agreed on, and we propose to
march in grand style, with a silk flag for
every man. Our badges will be 18 inches
long by 5 inches wiae, and each road's
trademark will be printed upon it."
The Eastern .railway representatives
will have a separate division in the parade
and will not march with the Southern
Pacific employes, not desiring to lose
their identity.
The following committees were ap
pointed by the meeting yesterday: On
band â Snedaker and Stern: on decora
tionsâCanfield and Hitchcock; on ban
ner â Fahnestock and Connor.
There will be more than 100 men in this
division. The flags, more than 100 of
which have been ordered, are very beau
tiful aad are made of pure silK. There ia
great enthusiasm among all the railway
agents, nearly haif ot whom are' Demo
crat?.
The green, canned and dried fruit and
produce division of the sound-money pa
rade will consist of from 1000 to 1200 voters
in marching order, followed by six largo
four-horse trucks iurnished with towering
side and end canvases, inscribed with
phrases significant of the importance in
California of the several industries repre
sented by the men participating in the
division. Colonel A. D. Cutler has been
elected marshal of the division, which in [
itself will extend for a space of three or
four blocks in the mammoth parade. Cap
tain Thomas S. Taylor has been appointed
chief aid and others are to be chosen. A
large meeting of the fruit and produce
dealers was held yesterday afternoon in
the rooms of the San Francisco Fruit Ex
cnange on Davis street. D. E. Allison was
chairman and R. N. Rowley secretary.
No case was shown where any one of the
seventy-five or eighty wholesale fruit firms
of the City had not voluntarily assented
to the demonstration in favor of sound
money.
As with the wholesale fruit and prod
uce firms, so it was thought from appear
ances it would be with most of the 400
retail, fruit-dealers. Very many of them
are Democrats and will continue to be
Democrats, but because they are in favor
of sound money they purpose to take part
in the Saturday parade.
The finance committee reported yester
day that it had already collected $400 for
expenses of decoration and band, which
was previously thought sufficient, but
when it was learned that the music com
mittee had found difficulty in securing a
sood band those present unanimously de
clarr-d for doubling their personal sub
scriptions that a good band might b<9 ob
tained, no matter what the cost. It was a
Democrat who most enthusiastically sug
gested this plan, and he himself at once
offered to contribute $25 extra if there
should still be not enough funds.
An order was issued for 1000 American
flags pcinted on tin and so mounted on
fiagsticks that when properly shaken by
1000 men the clattering of tin would cause
a remarkable noise calculated to draw
attention to the division. The main com
mittee will meet to-day at the same place
at 3 o'clock.
A meeting of the parade committee of
the millinery trade was held at Pioneer
Hall yesterday and arrangements were
perfected to join the industrial parade
next Saturday. Kovel and special features
will be introduced so as to make this
division of the textile trades one of the

button at its head. The committee con

MONTEITH IS NOT OUT.
The Populist Candidate for Congress In
the 1 ir s t District Explain* His
Position.
The following letter is self-explanatory:
San Francisco, Cal., Oct. 28, 1896.
J. W. Keagan, Santa Mota, Cal.â Dear Sib:
My attention nas just been called to a state
ment you are alleged to have made that Is re
ferred to in the Santa Kosa Democrat of yes
terday, in which you are reported to have said
that 1 had withdrawn and did not want any
one to vote for me. I cannot believe that you
ever made any such statement, as it is abso
lutely and unequivocally false. I simply told
you that I had been unable to make a canvass
Decause the State committee had, in an under
handed way, cut the organizaiion from under
me throughout the district, and I could get no
halls to speak in, and for that reason I was
obliged to cancel myappointments. You then
suggested if that were true that I had better
â withdraw, and I told you positively that I
would not withdraw, that while I was uiiauie
to make any canvass my name would remain
on the ticket where these Populists who op
posed tne machinations of those who con
trolled our State committee could vote for me
if they saw fit, that 1 would net solicit their
votes, but would simply let them use their
own judgment and let the matter stand ex
actly as it was. I did not give up my appoint
ments as a matter of choice, but because 1 was
forced to by circumstances over which I had
no control, and 1 did not say and never have
said and do not now say that I do not want
any one to vote for me.
Those who engineered this miserable Con
gressional fusion scheme and who went to
work afterward to tear me down simp'.y be
cnuse I would not have anything to do with it,
nnd thu.s succeeded in gagging and binding me
hand and foot, ought to be content with what
has already been accomplished without add
ing insult to injury.
Every one who knows me knows that if I
have anything to say I will do so frankly nnd
openly over my own signature and not beat
around the bush with statements to be given
out second hand. I have always said that if
it should be shown to me that my withdrawal
at any time would aid in the bnttie against
the railroad monopoly I would withdraw, but
not otherwise, anil I have consistently main
tained that position and that is wherj I now
stand and shall remain until the end.
I was traded off in your county in order that
the personal ambition of Thomas V. Cator
might be subserved, and whila I was ever will
iug to make any sacrifice of myself that would
in any wise aid the anti-railroad fight, I have
steadfastly refused to do anything to aid Cator
and nis friends to use the Populist party for
their personal advancement. Honorable union
was all right, but disgraceful fusion was all
wrong.
If you have made any statement to the effect
that I have withdrawn you certainly owe it to
me to correct it, and if you have not made the
statement your duty is equally clear to deny
it. Kespectfully yours,
Geoegb W. Monteith.
Mr. Monteith said in addition: "I have
remained on the ticket simply as a matter
of principle. There are a number of Popu
lists who, like myself, feel that they can't
neither support Mr. Cutler or Mr. Bar
ham and they desired to vote for their own
nominee. That is one reason why 1 re
main. The other is that I want the rail
road to distinctly understand ibat under
no circumstances can they ever force me
to do anything against what I believe to
be right and lam wholly indifferent as to
consequences. Every man who votes
for me votes to condemn the methods of
the railroad machine."

CARLISLE SPEAKS
AT LOUISVILLE
Given a Warm Welcome
in the Sound- Money
Stronghold.
Moved to Tears by the Wild
Enthusiasm of the Vast
Assemblage.
CLEVELAND' 3 NAME CHEERED.
The Sscretary Decares Hj Is Friendly
to Silver, but B lieves in a
Sound Currency.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 28.â Secretary
of the Treasury John G. Carlisle spoke to
niirht at Louisville, the stronghold of the
gold-standard Democrats of Kentucky.
He spoKe in the Auditorium, the
largest building in the city, and
tbe audience which listened to tbe
distinguished Kentuckian was even
greater than that which assembbd to do
honor to Palmer and Buckner, when they
were notified of their nominations last
month.
The Auditorium seats nearly 4500, and
every seat was taken by 7 o'clock. At 8
o'clock every aisle and doorway was
jammed, and there were about 7000 peo
ple in the building, which was beautifully
decorated witu the National colors.
One of the features of the evening was
the parade of the Non-Partisan Sound-
Money Club, the members of which
occupied seats on the stage.
Colonel John R. Fellows of New York,
who was taken ill here last night, occu
pied a box. Mr. Carlisle arrived at the
Auditorium at 8 o'clock, accompanied by
George M. Davie, chairman of the Na
tional Democratic Executive Committee.
His appearance on the stage was the sig
nal for an outburst of applause, which
continued for five minutes, with every
man in the audience on his feet, waving a
flag, handkerchief or hat.
Mr. Carlisle was very much affected by
the greeting he received and his handker
chief went to his eyes more than once.
Mr. Carlisle was listened to with the most
respectful attention. Tuere was not the
slightest attempt at disorder. The men
tion of President Cleveland's name caused
the speaker to be interrupted for nearly
two minutes by applause for the Presi
dent. Speaking of the Chicago platform
denunciation ot the Supreme Court, Mr.
Carlisle said that it was better to have an
all-powerful Concress and President than
to have a corrupt court.
He said that should a dishonest admin
istration come into power it could never
be displaced, as it could so use its patron
age that it could hold on despite all that
patriotic people could do. As for himself,
he was an American ci:izen and was for
his country lirst and party afterward.
The root of all the present evil, Mr. Car
lisle said, was the vicious legal tender
paper known as treasury notes, which
would be succeeded by streams of gold
should the currency be retired.
Mr. Carlisie said he had been accused of
being unfriendly to silver, but he would
say that if everybody was as friendly to
silver as the Secretary of the Treasury
there would be far more silver in circula
tion than there is at present. He said
that the treasury was continually paying
freight on silver to distant points, but it
kept coming back and could not be got
rid of.
Mr. Carlisle closed by appealing to all
good citizens to vote for honest Govern
ment and a sound currency.
When the Secretary took a seat, amid
great applause, there were loud yells for
Colonel Feliows, who came to the front
and made a few remarks. He referred to
the Covington egging by saying that the
majority of the peopie thought the Lord
intended eggs for food, but the silverites
believe they were made for argument.
Mr. Carlisle was very much amused at
the New Yorker's sally. When Colonel
Fellows had finished he and Mr. Carlisle
held an impromptu reception on the
state.
FALMEN AND RULKNER
They . Address â  Large and Enthusiastic
'.'â¢;â¢ Gatherings in lowa.
; OTTUMWA, lowa, Oct. 28.â The Palmer
and Buckner special train left Council
Bluffs this moraine: at 8 o'clock for its trip
acrost lowa. Us â : first stop was at Glen
wood, where the entire town and most of
the county, Â«o the ; number of .â  8000, â¢were
at the depot. â¢
After short speeches the train went; on
to ; Malvern, where a crowd of 1000 stood
in ia . heavy * rain sto 4 hear the speaking.
At , v Red Oak 'â  a great '; crowd awaited the
train and General Palmer,; spoke, drawing
a strong picture of the misery which the
country, especially the poorer people,
must suffer from free silver.
A stop was made at CreÂ«ton for an hour
ai:d an immense throng gathered to hear
the addresses. Other stops were made at
smalltr places and when Ottumwa was
reached 6000 people gathered at the depot
and greeted the train. The Sound Money
Democratic Ciub of Ottumwa received the
party and escorted it to the hotel. After
supper a great parade was formed nnd
marched through the city, after which a
great meeting was held at the opera
house, addressed by the candidates for
President and Vice-Presidpnt. It was an
enthusiastic gathering. W. I. Babb of
Mount Pleasant, the last Democratic can
didate for Governor of lowa, was chair
man.
GEATEFARD WRISTLING
Ridiculous Claims of the Democratic
Campaign Committee.
CHICAGO, 111., Ocfc 28.â Democratic
Campaign Committee Chairman Campau
received to-day additional telegraphic
final reports from State committee chair
men as follows:
Alabamaâ The Democratic electoral ticket
will receive not less than 50,000 majority.
The nine Democratic Congressional candidates
will be elected by majorities ranging from
500 to 7000.
New Yorkâ Letters from farming sections of
New York State and the enthusiasm of the
working class in the metropolis afford ample
assurance of victory for Bryan. Farmers are
offering land and crops to our Silver party
committee ior the cause. O'Brien Democracy
hold 200 meetings this week. McKinev
parades ana bets are mere devices. The
people are not with them.
ALEXANDER DELMAR,
Provisional Chairman titate Committee Na
tional Silver Party.
Francis M. Bixby, tor Young Democracy.
Pennsylvaniaâ Pennsyl7ania is making a
great battle and Is not surely Repuhlican.
Great silver gains are reported from ail the
Hgricultural counties and our mining counties
are lairly ablaze with enthusiasm. Whereas
we have now but two Congressmen, we expect
to return ten or twelve to help President
Bryan carry out his proposed reforms.
Kentuckyâ The drilt has be-n our way ever
since the Chicago convention. It is stronger
to-day than at any time previous. We will
win by a majority thai promises to reach
40.000.
New Hampshireâ The Bryan nnd Sewall
ticket is paining strength fast in New Hamp
shire. Wherever our speakers go we hear of
many converts and we shall carry towns that
never were Democratic before. The result in
both our Congressional dis tricts is very doubt
ful and the chances are more tnan even for
the election of the Democratic candidate for
Governor. The Republican claim of 10,000 to
20.000 in each of our Congressional districts
is absolutely absurd. In iact they are making
a most desperate struggle to save them. The
Palmer aud Buckner vote will be so small that
it is not worth meutiouing.
HAS NOTHING TO RETRACT
Archbishop Ireland Defends His Letter
of Two Weeks Ago,
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Oct. 28. â Arch
bishop Ireland of St. Paul arrived here
yesterday from Washington. The Arch
bishop is the guest of Hon. B. Storrer, and
will remain in Cincinnati several days and
then go to St. Paul in time to cast his
ballot.
Aichhishop Ireland was seen at the
Storrer residence, and readily agreed to a
short talK.
"I have nothing to add to my letter of
two weeks ago and nothing to retract from
it " said he. "I was asked oy a number
ot citizens of St. Paul to give my views on
lue present political crisis, and I have
done so. There may be criticism put upon
a churchman for entering into a political
controversy, and I have sDoken of that in
the letter. Ido not believe in a minister
entering into mere politics as such, but
there are times and questions whicli rise
above that and become matters of patriot
ism and morality, and we have a right to
speak then as citizens. What I would say
in an interview or in a letter I would not
say in the pulpit, and I would not permit
any minister under my control to speak
from the pulpit upon them. So what I
have said 1 have said as a private citizen,
who has the interest of his country at
heart."
A PRAYER FOR VOTERS.
Invocation of the J.piscopal Bishop, of
Washington, />. C.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 28.â A peti
tion prayer prepared by the Right Rev.
Bishop Satterlee, the new Episcopal
Bishop of Washington, will be read in all
the churches in this diocese next Sunday.
The preparing of special invocation for
the wise conduct of voters on election day
is quite a departure in Episcopal churches;
in fact, this is the first time in the history
of the church in America that such a step
has been taken. Bishop Satterlee's
prayer is as follows:
Most Gracious God, we humbly beseech thee
for the people of these United States in gen
eral, that thou wouldst be pleased to deepen
In them a sense of their responsibility as citi
zens of the commonwealth; to graft in their
hearts the conviction that the right of suffrage
is a trust from their country and from thee,
and to direct and prosper aTI their actions at
this present time to the advancement of thy
glory, tho good of the church, the safety, honor
and welfare of the peopie, that all things may
be so ordered and settled by their endeavors
upon the best and surest foundations; that
peace and happiness, truth nnd justice, re
ligion and piety may be establisheu among us
for all generations. These ana all other neces
sities for them, for us and thy whole church,
we humbly beg in the name and mediation ot'
Jesus Christ, our most Blessed Lord and
Savior. Amen.

A Colorado Mining Magnate Want* to
Bet on Bryan.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Oct. 28.â
W. S. Stratton, the rich gold mine owner
of Cripple Creefc, to-day made an offer to
bet sloo,ooo against $300,000 that William
J. Bryan is elected President. Mr. Strat
ton agrees that if he wins he will give the
money to the Colorado Springs Frea Li
brary, and if the others win they are to
have* the money. A syndicate of rich men
of the city is trying to raise the $30U,000.
Mm. Bryan Indisposed,
CHICAGO, ill., Oct. 28.â Mrs. Bryan
is showing signs of fatigue. She remained
in her room practically all day, while her
distinguishea husband was traveling about
the city campaigning. Mrs. Bryan has
been with the Democratic nominee for
several days, and the strain incident to
the railway travel and exciting scenes
connected therewith have caused her to
feel indisposed. There is nothing serious,
however, in her condition.

Canton Has a Day of Its
Own With the
Major.
Visibly Affected as He Surveys
the Sea of Upturned
Faces.
ILCQUENT CLOSE CF A CASE
"Ihe Argument Made and the Jury
. . Impatient to Render Its
Verdict." .
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 23.â A1l Canton
was divided in two parts this evening â
those who marched to Major McKinley's
residence and those who viewed and
cheered the marching thrones. The busi
ness men of Canton, irrespective of party,
announced a few days ago that on
Wednesday about sundown they would
â¢call in a body on Major McKinley. To
night they made good their promise and
they were joined in their demonstration
by. most of the other men in the city.
"More than 5000 men formed in line and
marched with banners and bands to the
McKinley residence just at sundown.
Darkness fell as they gathered in solid
phalanx in the street around the candi
â¢ date's home. T.^ere were acres of people.
Far as the eye could reach the glittering
â¢ erciights revealed a sea of upturned faces.
. Major McKinley has not been greeted by
a larger or more earnest assemblage than
that of his own tovÂ» - nsmen which con
fronted him to-night. He was visibly
affected and there was a thrill of emotion
in his voice when he spoke.
Introductory remarks were made by
Alexander Buford, one of Canton's most
venerable business men, and by \Y. \V.
Clark. Then the cheering for McKinley
commenced anew, and rolled in waves up
and down the street for many minutes.
It was the most engaging and most in
spiring scene of a day that has been
crowded with pleasant and interesting in
cidents. To his fellow-townsmen and
. neighbors Major McKinley said:
The people are aroused as never Defore, and
' I believe that the elections next Tuesday will
. show a much larger vote than was ever polled
in the history of our country before. We
. polled 12,000,000 votes four years ago, and I
.will be surprised if the vote on the 3d does not
far exceed that. In every State, county, city
and voting precinct, every American elector
feels this year that he has a grave duty rest
ing upon him, and I don't believe that any
one wi'.l willingly absent himself from the
polls. They are not only going to vote, but
they are going to vote right, as Goi gives them
to see right, independent of old party or politi
.cal relations. [Cheers.]
It is not a question of candidate?, it is not a
contention for office; it is a contention for
country; not a contention inspired by sec- j
tioiiai considerations, but of devotion to the !
d ity which fiffects and inspires the great heart I
of the American people. Not since the first
shot went crashing against ihe walls of Sum
ter, rudely awakening the start'.ed Nation to
â¢ the reiilization that civil war had commenced,
have ".he masses of our fei'.ow-countrymen
been aroused as now. With what shall
always seem to me an unaccountable rashness,
it' is proposed at the end of 120 years of a
glorious National Hie, propo.-ed in earnestness,
.for the first time in our history, to cast re
proach upon the honor of the American Na
tion. To give tffjct and force to that, not
merely by au act of a State Legislature or
congress, bad as that would be, the American
people are asked as they enter their booths
next Tuesday to solemnly ratify a proposition
that means National dishonor and repudia
tion. I don't believe they will ever do it.
. The issue may be obscured as it will; bril
liant orators or talented writers may weave
the most alluring sophistries, but the plain,
. bald propositions can't be hidden. The voters
of the United States are asked to say by their
'ballots that they nre willing that our National
"obligations shall be redeemed by the Govern
ment in money worth only about half as much
as the Governmentreceivedfor them; and that
. the pensioners of this Government â the men
â who were willing to give the best they had,
NUie best that any man possesses, their own
life's bloodâ shall have their pensions cut in
: two. The proposition is unworthy American
citizenship and iÂ«j an insult to the integrity,
the good faith and the inspiring history of
our great Republic. It should receive, and I ]
beiieve it will receive, a fitting rebuke from the !
ballots of 15,000.000 freemen. It should be !
so overwhelmingly defeated that no National
convention of any great party will ever dare
to make so debasing a proposition in any im
portant political campaign again, fi'hy, if it
prevails, how can the American name escape
dishonor?
What use to boast of the glories of the past if
we discredit them all in the living present?
Shall we proceed by reason of them to cast j
reproach upon the honored narms of the past i
by actual dishonesty now ? No nation can by
the fiction of the law justly absolve itself from
â¢ 'any honorable obligation. No nation can by
the wrongful exercise of power contravene the
eterpal principles of truth and jnstice and not
escape deserved and fearful retribution. [Ap
plause. J
The American people will never take so rash
and wicked a step as to invalidate or impair
the value of their own Government obliga
tions. They will never consent, by a popular
vote or otherwise, to the repudiation of one !
farthing of their National debt. They will
never brook the thought of not looking the
"whole world in the face and challenging any
â¢ nation to point to a more honorable or credit
able record than ours.
There can be no danger of American citizens
having to go bowed with shamed faces, either
at home or abroad; but. my fellow-citizens,
the arguments have been made; the case is
ready to go to the jury and the jury is waiting
impatiently to announce Its verdict, and we.
as. Republicans, confidently submit our con
tention to the great triounal of the American
people, the highest and best hope in the world.
They will, I am sure, demand the continuance
of our glorious institution-, unimpaired and
unthreatened, which for more tnan a century
past have made this ihe most bighlv honored
as well as prosperous Nation of the world.
â¢They will be true to their time-honored traits
as a mighty people.
Major McKinley made a stirring speech
â¢to an intensely enthusiastic delegation of
LOO Buffalo Republicans, which arrived
shortly after noon to-day. The delega
tion was composed of members of the Re
publican League and the Central I;alian
â¢ Club of Buffalo. The men were hand
somely uniformed, and marched with
military precision. The spokesman of the
Buffalo Republican League was Emory .P.
Close, its president. Amonj other things
lie said:
An Oriental cily became famous In medieval
days for its numerous pilgrims; but those pil
(frimages were i:i fulfillment of religious vows,
fired by religious enthusiam nt the shrine of
Mohammed. Likewise the Crusaders made
numerous pilgrimages to the Hoiy Land, in
spired by the eloquence of Peter the Hermit.
Their purpose was to rescue the tomb of the
6avior from the hands of the infidels. This
year has witnessed on the Western Continent
I a unique and extrnordinnry pilgrimage of an
I entirely different clinracter. Canton, in the
j State of Ohio, has become the Mecca of politi
cal devotion. Animated by ]>olitical convic
tions affecting the honor and prosperity of
70,000,000 of peopleâ convictions as deep and
as stirr ng as ever aroused religions fervor
over 1,000,000 citizens of this Republic have
during the past two months left thfir homes
and occupations and journeyed to this city to
attest here upon this modest doorstep their
devotion to the cause which you representâ
the cause of protection to labor and home in
dustry, reciprocity, sound money and National
honor.
The members of the Central Italian
Club were presented to Major McKinley
by Cxiixx Aniizzi. Mr. Close was fre
quently interrupted by arp : ause. After
the speech-making the Buffalo delegation
escorted MajorMcKiniey to his residence,
where a photograph was taken.
W T hen McKinley advanced to the edge
of the platform the audience rose to its
feet and cheered tumultuously. It was an
inspiring scene. Major McKiniey spoke
witti great vigor and earnestness.
A delegation come from Wellsville,
Ohio. It was composed of ?eventy-rive
women, who were presented to|Major Mc-
Kinley by Dr. Parks.
A delegation from Minerva, Ohio, ar
arived at half past 1.
Tbe next delegation was from Tyro,
Crawford County, Ohio. It was presented
by Charles McConnell.
A small delegation of well-known
Wheeling people called at the house of
Major McKinley, but no speeches were
made. Late in the affernooa Mr. McKin
ley'a associates on the ticket in 1869, when
he was a candidate for Prosecuting Attor
ney of this county, called. Judge W. W,
Underhill spoke on behalf of his col
leagues, S. C. Bowman, E. A. Johnson, J.
M. Allen and Thomas Stanley. The talks
were reminiscent in nature.
REED TALKS TO LEGIONS
Continued from First Page.
' j be seen prominent Republicans from all
' ! parts of the State. There was perfect
' I babel in the throng when Mr. Nelson
stepped forward and rapped for order.
1 lie had to do so a number of times, and
' even then the people did not heed him.
He finally gave up for a time his efforts to
restore quiet. Ten minutes after his rirst
attempt he was able to introduce Judge
j Ansel Smith of Stockton as the chairman
of the meeting. Prefacing his introduc
tion of the speaker of the evening, Chair
man Smith said :
It is an honor and pleasure to preside over
such a meeting as thisâ such a grand out
pouring from Stockton and from this section
of the State. It foreshadows the election on
Tuesday next of our great standard-bearer,
William McKinley. [Cheer after cheer was
here given.]
I shall have the added pleasure of intro
ducing to you to-night the greatest living ex
j ponent of Republican principles â a gteat man
I among great men.
Here the chairman read the long list of
' vice-presidents, and when among them he
came to that of Charles W. Yclland, for
twelve years the Democratic County Clerk
of Sin juaquin County, there was wild
i cheering. Several other names of prom
inent D'mocrats who have come out for
i sound money <vere greeted in like manner.
The long list completed, the band rendered
another selection* and then Chairman
I braith stepped forward and presented
j Thomas B. Reed of Maine to the people of
| Stockton ana the San Joaquin Valley.
The great building was shaken by the
yells of the throng. It was fully three
minutes before the sp aker of the evening
; could make himself heard. Mr. Reed spoice
in substance as follows:
If every California town of a few thousand
i inhabitants can pour forth in this fashion
| such a vast throng Ido not wonder that you
j are proud of yourselves. I wish very much
' | that I could claim this outpouring of the
j multitude as an evidence of a kindly feeling
i j for myself. I know better than this, for I
, j come from too far-away a State to know you
| well enough for this, and I know. :00. It is an
I evidence of the sentiment you feel for the
I great party and the great leaders wJiose cause
| lam to espouse to-night. If this sentiment Is
| as prevalent in the rest of California as in
Stockton what a voice will come from the Pa
cific f)r the cause we represent! Unless you
keep very quiet I cannot hope to reach more
tnan a quarter of this great throng, and at
! best I do not expect to make my voice reach
| more than half of you.
This country is on the verge of a great and
I important decision. It is impossible in de
| scribing it to use much of the language of
j rhetoric and oratory. Above all things we
i must, not allow ourselves to be carried away
I by expressions that nre In the nature of re
! proaches. I have no words of reproach for
those who go upon the sidewa'k and express
dissent.
I notice of late that many newspapers are
expressing it as their opinion that the multi!
-! tudes are mere deceivers; they would have us
j to Delieve that mis vast audience is made up
of cowards' and deceivers. If that is so I
would like to know how many honest men are
left in Stockton.
The crowd laughed, for nearly all of
Stockton was in the big building.
I have never doubted the courage and hon
esty of the people of these United States.
! Their courage has been tried in many a battle
i on the tented field. The charge of cowardice
against ihe workingmen is a charge against
the United States. If 70 per cent of our peo
ple are cowards what will be the future of this
country? We cannot, if that be so, prosper
under any President or any form of Govern
ment.
We are not divided into classes that govern
and classes that follow. In this country men
stand upon their intelligence. Some have it
developed in a greater, others in a less degree,
but the average makes us the greatest people
I that the sun ever shone upon. Upon that
common sense I rely, and the Republican
party relies upon it and has done so all during
its great history. During thirty-two years of
unprecedented prosperity this has been its
basis for hope of good times. Throughout
that period the people were governed by their
better judgment. That Is a long time for a
nation to be a good nation, and it's a wonder
that we have succeeded in doing so well so
long.
One sign I believe In of the recurrence of
such another period is the noble stand of the
sound-money Democrats. They have taken
the stand in Maine and they have taken it all
over this land. They will do it in California.
I know that the common sense of the Ameri-
I can people is only bounded on th/; West by the
j Pacific Ocean. lam inclined to think that out
here, you have even more hard seuse than
elsewhere in the land, and I will tell you why.
You are more face to face with the problems
of the day. In the East we have older com
munities. Our people are more settled and
every man knows his place. As I ride over
California and see its still undeveloped and
almost unknown resources I see that you are
not settled. The future is not jet known to
you.
The question which is before you is whether
your rich country will have the riches that its
luture deserves. You people of California
have studied the currency question in the
past. It confronted you years ago, but after
all it was found that the sound, sober sense of
the people decided the question and in a man
ner that meant much for your future. This is
not the first time the people of America nave
been introduced into the wilderness of bad
money. The Government issued its green
backs during the war. I wns here In this city
at the time, and I have always ndmircd the
wisdom and courage of California for her
Stand then for gold. I admired her attitude
then against greenbacks. You believed then
in gold and you paid your debts in gold. You,
people of Stockton, some of you, borrowed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29. 1896.
money at 3 per cent a month and gave your
real estate as security.
I The best hold in this world on prosperity is
not a stand for repudiation, but for a chance
to borrowâ you all want to borrow. These
men who are crying for repudiation come lor
wnrd and offer us a millenium if we will only
follow In their footsteps. They are afflicted
with tremendous knowledge of history, but it
is altogether of the history of foreign lands.
They point to Mexico's prosperity under her
silver policy. lam glad that Mexico has good
government and is prospering, but thank God,
wo not only got by Mexico long ages ago, but
are by her forever. They point to China.
There was a time I knew when California
did not think it could take lessons from China.
Has that time changed? Then they go away
back and worry over the dead Roman empire,
and declare that the only thing that made
Rome a failure was the failure of her mines.
Let us stand by our own history. We know
from past experience what has been and what
is best. After the war we had greenbacks and
were greatly bothered with their depreciation,
but sober sense prevailed. The people said,
â¢'We will have the greenback, but we will put
it on a par with gold." That was in 1879 and
for fourteen years prosperity ruled in this
land, and the riches accumulated during that
period have not departed irom this country.
Where have these peopleâ these millenium
peopleâ led us? Into the greatest cypress
swamp this Nation has ever been inveigled
into entering. We have beaten them in three
pitched battles. In 1894 the lines were so
drawn that they had no hope, and in sheet
desperation they raised the cry of free silver.
Why, silver has been demonetized since 1834
If you don't believe me just take the trouble
to hunt up that very instructive though not
always interesting recordâ the Congressional
Globe. You Hill find that in the year named
a Congressional committee said that only one
metal could be a standard. They said: "Let
us decide which metal it shall be."
Tho committee selected siivar, but a Senator
prevailed upon them to change in favor ol
gold. I can name no less than three Presi
dents of this country who were in Us favor. I
name them in the order of their distinctionâ
Franklin Pierce, James K. Polk and John
Quincy Adams of Massachusettsâ and the
mensure was conducted to victory by Daniel
Webster. Why, old Tom Bcnton, Andrew Jack
sou and all the ablest men in the country ad
vocated the gold standard. I would like to
know how many itinerant actors on the stage
of "I believe" could match that crowd.
Thsre is that everlasting folly of the cry of
a foreign policy. Not only is it folly, but
falsehood. For sixty-two years we have heard
that cry. A few years ago these people were
filling the land with their yells for low
prices â low prices for the consumer. They
thought the American people were a nation
of consumers; that we were all "teetering"
back iv rocking-chairs and consuming. Now
they say, "Follow us and we will gefyou high
prices." They say, "You want more money."
No. you don't. You don't want more money.
You want more capital, and don't make any
mistake between the two. Capital is the value
of the property ot the world. Money is the
medium of exchange. Money is a transferer
of property, just as I told a down-East audi
ence of farmers once that a hayrack was a
transferer of hay. Now, do you believe that
more hayracks will make a bigger crop of hay?
No; but a bigger crop of hay will make more
hayracks. When you have more property you
will have more money
Credit is money. When I give my check the
recepient believes I have money at the bank to
meet it. When I take another man's check I
believe he will pay it. The whole system of
credit money is founded on confidence. What
is the difference between the United States do
ing business and the United States doing what
it is now. No one dares to go into business.
No one dares to loan money. No one dares to
borrow. We are now marking time. One of
the causes for our doing this and nothing else
is the action of the Chicago convention.
You want not money, but capital. When
you get capital the money will take care of it
self. It has always been Â»o in tbe history of
the world. This question resolves itself into
one of votes.
The sober-minded par;y that I am uphold
ing to-night is represented by Mr. McKinley
aud Mr. Hobart [cheers], the other by Mr.
Bryan and Mr. [hesitating] somebody
else. [Laughter.]
Not only must you support a good adminis
tration, but you want to elect good Congress
men from California.
I know from experience that you never had
a more vigorous or persistent worker for your
interests than Mr. Johnson. You should see
to it that he goes back to Congress. [John
son's name was greeted with cheers.]
It is not only a victory we want next Tues
day â we have that; we want the overwhelm
ing voice of the people for good government.
At the conclusion of his address three
cheers were given with a will for Reed
and three more rousing ones for the Re
publican standard-bearers.

TRIP ON THE SAN JOAQUIN
Speaker Reed Shown the Neces
sity cf Further Improving
the Stream.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 28.â Thomas B.
Reed o! Maine, whose name is on every
lip in Stockton to-night, to-day had an
opportunity to see the prcat need of liberal
Government appropriations for the im
provement of the San Joaquin River. When
luncheon was over at the Hotel Imperial
the visitors were driven to the water front
to embark for an hour's ride on one of the
river steamers of the California Naviga
tion and Improvement Company. In the
party were the Maine statesman, his
daughter, Miss Reed, Charles M. Short
ridge, W. M. Rank and wife, P. A. Buell
and wife, F. W. Van Sicklen, Eli S. Den
nison, H. J. Corcoran, William Inglis, Su
pervisor Henderson, Judge Ansel Smith,
Miss Aldrich, J. F. Aldrich and Charles
Jackson. The afternoon was a perfect one
for the object of the tripâ to show the
Congressional leader how badly the great
river of this valley needs Government aid.
The little river steamer was moored out
side of a baree and the water was so low
in Stockton Channel that the vessel was
far below the wharf and the excursionists
had to clamber down a steep incline. The
atmosphere was warm and grew almost
hot before the trip ended. The sky was
without a cloud, and as the little steamer
poked its nose down the channel toward
the river a beautiful vista was unfolded to
Mr. Reed, who went onto the hurricane
deck that he might not ruiss any of the
scenes along the stream.
His giant forsi seated on a camp stool,
and his hat pulled down over his eyes to
Â«hade them from the sun, the man from
Maine seemad to drink in all the beauties
of the landscape. The water was like
glass and down the channel was a schooner
laden with grain and millstuffs, lazily
making for the river, the water in the
channel being so low that the mate could
reach the bottom with a pole, and he was
propelling her toward deeper water by
this means. Farther down the big Gov
ernment dredger was at work digging mud
and debris from the bottom of the channel.
P. A. Buell and H. J. Corcoran sat besido
the guest of the d*.y and pointed out how
the $24,000 a year spent on the dredger
could be saved and navigation aided by
making a channel straight from Stockton
that would cut off several bends in the
river.
Finally the ladies came up to the upper
deck, and presently nearly all of the party
ascended to secure a better view. Mount
Diablo in the west looked but a few miles
away. Stockton's smoking mills were
left behind and the winding, tortuous San
Joaquin could be traced for miles with
the glass. Reed was silent most of the
time on the down trip, listening intently
to the information that was being pre
sented to him by the representatives of
the Stockton Commercial Association. On
the return trip to Stockton he entered into
a discussion on the subject of river im
provement that showed nis thorough
knowledge of the question. The return
trip was the most de'L'htful part of the
excursion. The reclaimed lands on either
side of the river and channel presented
busy scenes in places where gardeners
were preparing for their nightly shipments
ot vegetables to the San Francisco market.
"What are those?" asked Reed, as box
after box of great purple eggplant was un
leaded from a wagon. The Easterner had
not seen any of such gigantic growtn as
are raised on the reclaimed lands near
here. He was also astonished at the
housetops along the river banks covered
with scarlet-colored peppers drying for
market, whose glistening skins looked
redder as the sun's rays glanced upon
them. The little steamer churned up the
mud as it moved slowly upstream to avoid
the sadnbars that the people of this section
want the Government to have removea.
The sun was going down toward Di
ablo's top and shed a soft red glow over
the long line of grain warehouses that ex
tend for a mile along the channel, and
lighted the windows of the big flourmills.
A line of cars of the Valley road stood on
a sidetrack at the city's edge, and the
glare was reflected from the yellow pas
senger coaches. The busy crowd of car
penters at work on the immense bunkers
of the coal stopped to view the passing
excursionists, and the scene seemed im
pressed on the guest of tho day, for he
made some pertinent inquiries as to the
magnitude of the trade of Stockton and
the volume of trade carried on by water.
The visitors were soon driven back to
their Hotel to prepare for the evening's
demonstration.

It is believed these will not be sufficient
to permit all of the visitors to hear the
orator.
Special trains will be run from every
town in this section. Sonoma San Ra
fael, Guerneville, Petaluma, Healdsburg
and a dozen other neighboring towns will
send marching clubs. The procession will
be the greatest that has ever threaded
the streets of a Sonoma city.
AT REPUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS
No Fears for Illinoisâ lndiana, Missouri
and California Counted as Safe
for McKinley.
CHICAGO. 111., Oct 28.â Telephone
messages and personal callers kept the
campaign managers in a constant state of
activity to-day at Republican, National,
State and county headquarters. The rank
and rile of the party were concerned about
the effect which Mr. Bryan's campaign in
Cook County might have on the election
day result in the city and State. To all
such inquiries the Republican leaders re
turned the answer that the eleventh-hour
effort of the Democrats to capture the
majority of the Chicago voters would not
change any material number of votes
already fixed on the Republican side, and
there was no fear expressed at any head
quarters that a stampede was possible.
The big crowds were accounted for by the
j fact that this was Chicago's first real
chance to see and hear the Democratic
Presidential nominee, and hundreds of
P.epublicans went to each meeting chiefly
from curiosity, without havine their
voting mind affected in the least by the
arguments of Mr. .Bryan.
National Committeeman Jamieson of
Illinois, who has been the most conserva
tive of any party manager here when
dealing with the Republican side of the
situation, said: "I feel justified in increas
ing the figures of McKinley's estimated
majority in Cook County as a result of
Bryan's visit. There is no such thing as
defeat here. Tlie Bryan and Altgeld
managers are straining every effort to
carry Illinois, on the theory that this State
I holds the key to the Presidential situation.
The labor vote here for McKinler will be
bagger than the Democratic managers
have any idea of. "We can allow them 70
per cent of it and win in a walk."
Fenton R. McCreery of Michigan, late
secretary of the legation to Chill, has re
turned from a stumping tour of California.
! He reported that the outlook for McKin
ley's success in that State was excellent,
because of division in the Democratic
party in view of the money question.
He also stated that General Rosecrans,
commander of the Army of the Cumber
land, now resident in California, had de
clared for McKinley, who served under
the general in the Army of the Climber
land.
Mr. Hanna said he had received infor
mation from Missouri on which be based
the claim that the Republicans would
elect the Governor, a majority of the Leg
islature which is to name a successor to
Senator Vest, and that the party stood
more than an even chance of getting the
Presidential electors.
The latest reports received by Mr. Payne
were from Indiana. He said they showed
the German vote was for McKinley, and
that would save the day if nothing else
did. He called Chairman Campau's table
of the Democratic estimates ridiculous.
As to counteracting the Bryan demonstra
tions he said the National Committee had
P3id no attention to him in this respect
for three weeks.

BRYAN'S RAID
ON CHICAGO
Talks From Early Morning
Until After Mid
night.
Monster Gathering of Curious
People to Hear the Can
didate.
ELEVEN ORATORICAL EFFORTS
Eight Thousand Wel'-Dressed Women
at One Meeting Are Frantic*
ally Enthusiastic
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 28.â Mr. Bryan
was whirled about Chicago all day from
one meeting-place to another, to fulfill
the engagements made for him to speak to
a majority of the voters of the city. He
began at 10 a. m. and with intermissions
for meals kept up the work until mid
night.
It was a hard day, and the nominee re
quired all his strength to sustain nim to
the end. The atmosphere was close and
sultry, and inside some of the places where
he made addresses it became so over
charged with humidity that many people
fainted. Mr. Bryan's oratorical efforts for
the day numbered eleven, including two
that were scheduled at the last minute.
These two were supposed to be exclu
sively for women, but many men attended
them and led ths cheering for the nomi
nee.
Beginning in the morning with an ad
dress to a crowd of foreign women, mostly
Poles, at St. Stanislaus Hall, in the Polish
quarter, he concluded there in time to
keep a promise to speak to an audience of
business men in Battery D Armory on the
lake front at noon.
Three o'clock found him again, this
time in company with Mrs. Bryan, nt Bat
tery D armory, talking to about 8000 half
suffocated, well-dressed women, who
raved over him as though he were a sec
ond Paderewski. .Between 4 and 5 o'clock
he addressed an immense open-air meet
ing in the stockyards district, probably
the most enthusiastic of the day.
General C. P. Howard, formerly a Re
publican, a veteran of the late war, and a
brother of General O. O. Howard, U. S A.,
who is one of the generals engaged in
stumping the country for the Republican
National ticket, presided as the business,
men's meeting. J. A. Pugh had been as
signed to present General Howard, but his
speech was nipped in the bud.
"1 have the honor," he said, "of intro
ducing to you as your chairman a gentle
man who has been in business in this city
for the past twenty-eight years,"
He did not get any further. A clean
shaven young man with a brown felt hat
jammed on his head came on the stage
irom the wings nnd a great shout went up
from the audience.
The Democratic National nominee had
been recognized instantly. He tooit off
his overcoat as the sheering went on and
bowed slightly in acknowledgment of the
warm greeting given as he sat down.
General Howard mnde a little speech
before presenting the candidate.
"Mr. Bryan asks one question," he said.
"Are these all business men?"
"Yes," came in chorus from the audi
ence, intermingled with shouts of, "and
workingmen."
"I told him they were business men, ac
cording to his definition," General How
ard v;ent on.
The crowd understood the reference
even before General Howard told tiiem
what the candidate had said about farm
er?, laborers and miners beinc as much
business men as those who sat in back of
fices and cornered the money of the world.
When General Howard concluded there
was another uproar. Mr. Bryan jumped
on a chair and tried to quell the noise by
raising his hands. Quiet was finally re
stored, and be benan a speech that lasted
an hour. He said in part:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: I am
glad that this meeting is presided over by one
who until this time has been a Republican
and by one who was a soldier. [Applause.]
Because in this double character of ex-Repub
lican and soldier be illustrates tbe depths to
which society is stirred In this campaign.
As an ex-Republican he stands as a repre
sentative of that large and increasing number
ot our citizens who are willing to burst
asunder party ties and to leave puny associates
and make their party affiliaiio.is suit the con
victions of the heart. [Cheers.] And as a for
mer soldier he stands us a representative of
those who, haying willingly offered their
services to make this Nation one, are willing
to-day to eneape In this great contest to keep
this Nation, which they helped tosave.an inde
nendeni Nation rather than a province of a
foreign empire. [Cheers]
lam glad' to talk to businessmen. I have
said that those whoso often assume to bo the
only business men sometimes make a great
mistake in assuming that the prosperity of
the Nation rests upon them. lam going to
day to talk to business men and to say to
them that, in pleading the cause of the farmer
and the laborer, I am trying to lay a substan
tial foundation upon which the business, of
this country can be done. [Cheers]
If you who are engaged in merchandise, en
gaged in the exchange of wealth, suppose that
the prosperity of the producers depends upon
you, you deceive yourselves. Wealth must be
creuted before it can be distributed. Those
who create wenlth could live, although you
went out of business. You cannot live if the
f>roducers of wealth go out of business.
Cheers.]
I believe that that policy is best for this
country which begins with those who toil and
gives them first the inspiration to work and
then protects them in the enjoyment of a
rightful share of the proceeds of tneii- toil, and
proceeds from them up to the other classes of
society which rests upon them. [Cheers.]
I say to you that the Republican platform
adopted this year is a fraud. I say that it was
intended as a iraud. [Cheers.] I say that the
men who wrote it wrote it to deceive the
people aud secure an advantage by deception
that they could not obtain openly. [Cheers.]
Do you say that we have no right to inter
fere with private contracts ? I ask one of you
to enter into a contract to collect 20 percent
and see whether the Government has any right
to Interfere. Upon what theory is usury law
based? It is based upon the theory that the
man who borrows money needs lo beprotected
from the avarice of the man who loans him
money.
When a man tells me that we have not a
right to protect the money of the United
States against the conspiracies of those who
would degrade it, I tell you that we have more
right to prevent gold contracts or silver con
tracts than you have to prevent one individual
from agreeing to pay another more than a cer
tain rate of interest.
I want to say to you that we who believe in
enforcing the laws against all classes of so
ciety are better friends of government than
those who would make scapegoats of little
criminals and then let big ones run at large
and run the Government itself. [Applause.]
The very men who would suffer most from
the enforcement of the law are the ones who
seem to be most terribly alarmed for fear there
will be a lax enlorcement of the law. They
are not afraid that 1 will encourage lawless
ness, but they know that, if I am elected, the
trusts wilrnot select the At torney-Gcneral who
will administer the law. [Wild cheering and
cries of "Altgeld would make a good Attorney-
General."]
Mr. Bryan's third address was delivered
before au audience composed costly of
women. It was a well-dressed gatnering.
Nearly all the ladles who attended came
in gowns suitable for afternoon calls.
They crowded into the building as soon as
the doors were opened, filled the limited
number of chairs on the floor and took
possession of all available standing room
and every chair in the gallery.
Several thousand who were unable (0
gain entrance stood on the outside to see
the candidate when he arrived. It was
intensely close inside the armory, and a
dozen women succumbed. Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan reached the armory' at 3 o'clock.
As they came on the stage, where a quar
tet of young women had jiut finished
singinp a patriotic song, the audience ro^e
en masse and cheered with vigor, the
deep tones of the m:ile portion drowning
the shrill cries from the laa:es.
Mrs. Duncanson, president of the
Women's Club, introduced Mr. Bryan,
who made a very briff speech, similar to
those delivered on his tour before other
gatherings of women.
Leaving Mrs. Bryan behind, the candi
date proceeded to the Transit House, in
the stockyards district, accompanied by
Thomas Gahan, National Committeeman
from Illinois, and ex-Mayor Cushing of
Omaha.
The stand from which he spoke was
erected on the south side of the Transit
House, and in the narrow street just in
iront of it a irreat throng had assembled.
The space was badly contracted. A bin
Jivery stable marked the boundary for the
rear of the crowd, wiich of necessity
spread out over the s dcs for a consid
erable distance. Twenty-five thousand is
a reasonable estimate of that mass of
sweltering humanity waiting for Mr.
Bryan to appear.
It was 4:15 o'clock when he didcome
and the remarks Tim Carrabine, a local
commission merchant, was making were
cut short in the storm of applause that
arose. Mr. Carrabine introauced him,
handing him a silver horseshoe as he did
so, and tbe multitude howled again.
The audience was composed principally
of stockyard men, who manifested wild
approval of some of the remarks made by
the candidate.
To-night Mr. Bryan devoted his efforts
to the West siae. His last appearance was
set for 10 o'clock, but he was more than an
hour late in keeping the appointment.
Novathy's Hall, Bohemian Turner Hall,
Pulaski Hall, the mammoth tent and Peo
ple's Institute and the Second Regiment
Armory were visited in turn, and at eacn
the number of people who endeavored to
obtain admittance far exceeded the capa
city of the place in which he spoke.
His greatest reception of the evening in
point of numbers and enthusiasm was at
the mammoth tent. Th' canvas structure
was not a third large enough to accommo
date those who sought entrance, and
many thousands of people stood for hours
deeply massed on the outside, patiently
waiting, but unable to see or hear the man
oi whom lhey had heard so much.
When Mr. Bryan returned to ti>e Audi
torium annex, after rnidnieht, lie went to
bed. to be prepared for his early start to
morrow morning on his flying trfp to
towns near Chicago.
EGG-THROWERS PUNISHED.
He/eased From Prison at the Request of
Mr. Bryan, but Will Be Expelled
From College.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 28.â Two younsr
men, Chauncey C. Foster and Lewis Han
chett, were arrested this noon for throw
ing eggs at Bryan during his ride from the
train to Battery D yesterday. They nd
mic their guilt. Foster is 17 years old and
son of a retired merchant. Hanchett is
the same age. His father is vice-president
of the Hancbett Paper Company. The
boys were locked up pending further in
vestigation.
On learning of the srrest of the two
youne men charged with being implicated
in the egg-throwing incident yesterday
Bryan" wrote to County Chairman Gohan
asking for their release, as he was sure it
was an act of thoughtlessness, and their
arrest had doubtless been a sufficient les
son to them and others.
Principal Powers of the Business Col
lege announces that the boys will be ex
pelled from that institution.
On the strength of Xhe written plea for
their release sent by Mr. Bryan the police
to-night released Foster and Hanchett
from custody with a warning not to of
fend again, and the young men were taken
home by their fathers. Foster admitted
to the detectives that he had bought a
dozen fresh eggs to throw at the procession
when the Bryan carriage passed the busi
ness college building. Half of the eggs
were thrown before the youths took fright
and ran from the room.
Mr. Powers, the proprietor of the school,
announced to-night that he would as
semble all the instructors and pupil 3 to
morrow at noon and publicly dismiss the
egg-throwers in disgrace from the institu
tion after making a few remarks vigor
ously denouncing the offense ana the two
culprits.

NEW, TO-DAY.
LIKE THE PARENTS.
Boys Can Have Their Coffee Now.
When a good, healthy boy sits down to
his breakfast and sees Pa and Ma have
their coffee to dip toast in and sip he feels
slighted that he can't have some too. But
parents know that it is really poisonous to
j children and refuse them. Postum, the
j grain coffee made by Postum Cereal Co.
I lim., Battle Creek, Mich., is exacily like
coffee in looks, and yet it is made of the
healthful grains and is nourishing and
fattening. Boys and girls can drink it
every meal if they like. It is simply fool
of the most nourishing sort, but so pre-
pared that it fills tho eye of even a careful
expert.
Dr. E. Schoene. 1176 Milwaukee aye.,
Chicago, says: "I am very much pleased
with Postum. It is a delicious drinli, and
I think preferable to all similar products,
such as Health Coffee, Malt, eic."
A reliable grocer will never offer a cheap
or weak imitation of a genuine ork'inal
article because he happens to nruke a
little extra profit. But' it is well to ob-
! serve that when genuine Postum Cereal
coffee is ordered that you get Postum and
not a spurious imitation offered as "just
is good."

TEXAS VISITED
BY A TORNADO
Much Damage Is Reported
' . in the Vicinity of
' . Sherman.
A Number of Persons Seriously
iDJured and Several Are
Missing.
FREAKS OF THE FIERCE STORM
Not More Than Fifty Feet Wide, but
It Tears Up Everything
in Its Path.
. SHERMAN, Tej:., Oct, 28.â A tornado
originated about 5:15 P. m. near Farming
ton, sixteen miles southwest of Sherman.
After forming it took a northeasterly
course, passing about three miles east of
Sherman, and was seen by hundreds of
people in this city. The usual tornado
phenomena were prevalent. The barome
ter registered 29.4, six points lower than it
â  did on May 15 when tbe disastrous tor
â¢ â¢ nado visited this city. Citizens here were
much excited, and it was some time be
fore any effort was made to learn the ex
tent of the damage. The first destructive
work of the storm was noted twelve miles
southwest of Sherman, where it demol-
ished a house on the farm of George Duke.
'No one was hurt at that place.
The tornado rose from the earth, striK-
ing again at a point about four miles
southeast of Sherman, where it demol
ished a tenant house on the farn. of Jim
Farris, occupied by a family named
Hayes. Four members of this family
â¢ were seriously hurt and it is reported that
; Mr. Hayes' back is broken. Several per-
Bons telephoned from a suburban resi
dence in that neighborhood asking that
' searchers be sent out to look for persons
who are missing. Requests were also
made for physicians, bandages, stimu
lants'arid other articles necessary to care
for the wounded. Reports of the number
wounded are very indefinite, as it turned
very dark soon after the passing of the
storm. A man who was in the Farris
Held is among the missing.
Manager _ McÃride of the Western
.Union Telegraph Company sighted the
.storm .when it was just south of tte city,
and wired the Denison office to that effect.
. Denison is twelve miles north of here,
and. in thirty minutes Mr. McÃride re
v. ceived a message stating that the storm
was .passing e.ast of Denison. This would,
make its speed near twenty-five miles an
â¢,--. hour. The storm was not more than fifty
, ..feet wide, but it plowed up the wheat in a
held which it passed through.
. . " 'A report-comes in that Lovings school
â¢ ' house, four' miles east of Sherman, was
'ijnroofed.' .The sky lighted up brilliantly
during the passage of the storm, but
. ..darKness- followed.
LIGHTNING DEALS DEATH.
Electric and Bain Storm Passes Over
nisconsm.
- MILWAUKEE, Wis., Oct. 23.â A severe
. 'electric and rain storm passed over Wis
.'â¢consin early this morning doing consider
â¢'. able damage* at various points.
i ' At-Antigo, the residence of D. Dexter,
the postmaster of Deerbrook, was struck
â¢â¢ by lightning. Mr. Dexter was killed and
"â¢' his two sons, sleeping in an adjoining
room, received severe shocks, but were
. .otherwise uninjured.
. At Wausau lightning struck the residence
of William Genrich and almost simulta
neously the residence of Albert Baldwin,
near to the Genrich residence, was struck
by anotner bolt.
The first stroke awakened Mr. Baldwin
and his sons and they arose to see what
Â° .damage had been done.* The second one
threw them prostrate on the floor and all
sustained a heavy shock. Considerable
'damage was done to the house. The tele
â¢ phone line -between Wausau and Merrill
. -was disabled.
LYNCHING OF A FIEND
Pays the Penalty at the Hands
: of a Mob for Braining a
Little Child.
Had Quarreled With His Employer
.and Sought to Square
Accounts.
.; â¢ " WINONA, Minx., Oct. 28.â X rumor has
.reached here that Palmer, the North Bend
murderer, has been lynched. It is stated
â  â¢ that the officers started with the man
â¢ . from North 'Bend for Black River Falls,
â¢ but that they were overtaken by a mob of
twenty determined men, who tied a rope
'about the murderer's neck and hanged
'him from a railway bridge.
. '. Palmer, a young lellow of 18 years,
lived, with a farmer named Marshall, a
â¢mile and a half from North Bend. He
quarreled with his employer and squared
'accounts in a manner most diabolical.
Early in tbe afternoon he took little Oscar
'Marshall, a bright and pretty child of 3
â¢years.out to tbebarn. where he deliberately
took an ax and brutally pounded in the
"Vicbild's skull.
.' â¢â¢ ; # Dr. Rhodes was summoned from Gales
ville", but when he came the child was be
- yond human aid and soon died. Upon a
careful search of the premises Palmer was
found in an icebox. He had smeared his
face and lips with carbolic acid and made
them a horrible sight. His eyes were
_ .shut and he was pretending to have com
. .*â¢ mitted suicide.
" His pulse was felt and found to be
normal. He was stood on his feet and
* made to walk. For some time he kept
â¢â¢"up his pretended stupor, but finding it
â¢ would" not work with his enraged captors,
â¢" broke down, opened his eyes and con
fessed. He admitted that his motive for
killing the child was to get even with
. Marshall.
A LITTLE HERMMAN'S FATE.
fiaved Her Brother and Sister, but Lost
Her Own Life.

attached to Mrs. Cleveland's carriage fall
ing and dislocating the harness whiie

was the occasion of no little temporary j
excitement. The mishap occurred on Penn

the carriage caused for a few moments
some consternation, but the immediate
recovery of the equine to a standing posi

resulted caused a gathering crowd to
quickly disperse.

TACOMA'S STOLEN
GIRLS RECOVERED
Guardian Burkhart Finds
the Abducted Roberts
Children.
Had Been Spirited Away From
a Superior Courtroom in
August
LOCATED IN LOS ANGELES.
End of a Search Which Long Baf
fled the Northern City's
Detectives.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. '2S.â The cele
brated Roberts case, which occupied the
attention of all branches of the Superior
Court last summer, haa been revived by
the return to-day of Dr. W. E. Burkhart
from Los Angeles with the two missing
giris, Maude and Olive Roberts, aged 10
and 13, who mysteriously disappeared
from the office of Claypool & Cushman on
August 10 last.
The children had been before court that
day on a hearing for the appointment of
Dr. Burkhart as their guardian, on the
ground that their father was not a proper
person for them to live with. Eooerts'
wife, formerly Josie Brown, was alleged
to have a shady record.
While Judge Pritchard wa3 writing an
order, the girls were left in an inside
room. When the Judge had finished
speaking, and the new guardian went after
his wards they were out of sight. Numer
ous suits of injunction, contempt, perjury
and habeas corpus disclosed that they xiad
gone from the courthouse alone to the of
fice of Frank Cushman, attorney, but be
yond that they could not be traced.
In a suit against Roberts for perjury
and contempt the testimony of Frank
Cushman could not be obtained, as he
went to the wilds of Okanagon imme
diately. The hearing was continued from
time to time, the prosecution waiting for
Cushman, but not until Roberts had for
feited his bail of $1000 and left did Cush
man return.
As near as can be learned, Mrs. Roberts
took the girls to Seattle, and then to San
Francisco, where Roberts joined them and
took the family to Los A-igeles, where he
is keeping a fruitstand. He had been one
of the most prominent music-dealers here.
Mrs. Burkhart is a sister of the girls' dead
mother.
RACED ON THE OCEAN.
The Steamship Empress of China Beaten
by the French Cruiser
A/ger.
VICTORIA, B. C, Oct. 28.â Oriental
papers received by the Victoria give a de
scription of an ocean race between the
Em press of. China and the French cruiser
Alger.
It is stated that the Alger left Kobe for
Yokohama, its engines doing seventy-six
revolutions, giving a speed of thirteen
knots. The Empress of China was follow
ing two miles astern. This steamer had
proved a victor in a race with the United
States fast cruiser Oiympia.
The merchantman gradually overhauled
the cruiser and when about 800 metres off
hauled down her colors so she might not
have to salute the cruiser as she passed.
The Alger immediately increased her
speed to eighty-five revolutions, and the
Empress responded by increasing her
speed. Gradually, with the aid of her
Belleville boilers, the Alger increased to
nJnety-two revolutions,. and an hour iater
got up a speed of 17 knots an hoar, which
enabled her to p3ss the Empress.
The next morning at 9:40 o'clock the
Alger steamed into Yokohama two hours
in advance of the Empress of China.
This feat proves that the Alger in the
course of a few hours' steaming
could easily have attained her trial speed
of twenty knots, and her performance is
said to be all the more praiseworthy from
the fact that a majority of her firemen
had been transferred to her less than two
hours before the race commenced and had
never seen Belleville boilers before.
JAPANESE AID THE REBELS.

Several Japanese were arrested ana a
thorough search of their residences was
made. The Japanese became alarmed and
placed themselves under the protection of
the German consulate. As further pro
tection for Japanese at Manila the Japan
ese Government sent a warship there.

The ex-Governor is very popular with
the Spanish-speaking citizens. He has
made many speeches in the mother lan
guage with the most flattering results.
To-night he spoke for two hours to Span
ish-Americans before going to the pavilion.
; He said that he had heard before com ing
S'oMth. that the whole country here was
under the domination of. the Popocrata,

AN OPEN LETTER TO GOVERNOR JAMES H. BUDD.
San Francisco', Cal., Oct. 27, 1896.
Hon. James H. Budd, Governor of California Sir: In your speech
delivered at Union Hall Monday evening as reported in the morning
papers occurs the following passage :
This noonday parade is outrageous. What is it for ? What is it for ?
Thank God they can't crawl into the ballot-booth and see bow you vote. Turn out, all of you. Turn out, I sayâ the more
the merrier. I'ou've got a wife and little ones at home. You must consider them and yourself. This is just like the turnout
of men at Sacramento. They were not "coerced," just "requested." Turn out, all of you, and as you walk think of the
aspect of employers marching men through the streets to spot them. I have seen a horse parade at the State Fair and I
have seen a jackass parade, and I've read of a parade of slaves to the block, but never before have I heard of such attempts
to intimidate laborers and clerks as at this time.
March with them, but when you get into the ballot-booth put the holy cross opposite the names of the Bryan electors
They may march you, but you can crucify them with a cross on election day
This gratuitous insult to men who choose to make a public show
ing of their political preference is undignified and unbecoming to
the great office you hold. It has not even the merit of origi
nality. It is the conception of an inflated individual who is
striving to talk himself into a high place, and whom you with evi
dent reluctance are compelled- to support at the eleventh hour.
My life has always been and still is that of an employe. I never
held or sought a political office. I don't think I should feel
honored by one if sejeured by a subterfuge such as is currently ru
mored to have been practiced in 1894.
I did not intend to march in Saturday's procession, but shall
now do so. And the man who asserts or intimates that I am bribed,
coerced or intimidated into so doing is well, he don't tell the
truth. Respectfully (?) GEORGE E. HERRICK.
chance to hear Hon. Thomas B. Reed of
Maine?"
It is claimed that this evening fully 100
telegrams were forwarded to Stockton, re
ouesting Reed to give this city one visit.
The eminent statesman has scores of warm
political friends in this locality, and if
Sacramento were included in bis li<t of
appointments he would be accorded an en
thusiastic welcome â one that would assure
him that Sacramento County was for Mc-
Kiniey, protection and Thomas B. Reed.
LEMOS AT WATSONVILLE.
Portuguese- Americans HÂ»ar Campaign
Issues j*bly Discussed.
WATSONVILLE. Cal., Oct. 28.â Tbe
first of a series of Republican meetings to
be held each night during the rest of the
week in this city was called to order at
the opera-house to-night.
Hon. Frank I. Lemos addressed the
Portuguese voters and was met by a
crowded honse. Prior to the meeting the
Pajaro brass band, composed entirely of
young Portuguese, discoursed patriotic
airs throughout the principal streets.
The meetine was called to order by A.
H. Martin. He introduced Mr. Lemos,
who talked interestingly and pointedly to
his countrymen in the Portuguese lan
guage.
The speaker touched upon the present
price of wheat as controverting Bryan's
arguments that agricultural products
could not rise under the gold standard
and showed that supply and demand
regulated the price of these products.
Mr. Lemos dwelt at some length on the
silver question, and told his bearers that
if all the ills that Bryan speaks of were
due to the "crime of '73," they ought to
be grateful at least to the demonetization
of silver for what has happened to the
wage- earner.
He quoted statistics on this point and
showed ih.it the per capita waee was" in
creased from $302 in 1573 to $4&> in 1890.
The principal industry of the farmers in
this neighborhood being the raising of
sugar beets, the speaker dwelt on that
topic, and as a result many of bis
auditors have changed their views to
night, and will vote for a policy which en
courages the industries of the country.
BUDD SCORED AT SAN RAFAEL
General linrnta Ilnndltt lhe State's
Errcutiv* Without Gloves.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Oct. 28.â General
Barnes spoke here to-night to a very large
audience.
He answered Governor Budd, who spoke
last night, and he did not mince his words.
He regretted that a man in the high posi
tion of the Governor could bring himself
to speak such words of the free men who
would join in Saturday's parade.
The man who said that those em
ployes and laborers were cowards and
liars must be both himself. White's
speeches, too, had surprised and pained
him, but perhaps he was doing
the best he could in his environment, for
White rightly belonged to the true Dem
ocracy and not to the Populists and
cranks who were pulled out of the old
party by them.
And Baud abusing Cleveland, a man
whose shoes he is not worthy to untie !
Mr. Barnes deplored this bitter, vicious,
unreasonable, cowardly, destructive cam
paign.
"We have never had the like of it," said
he, "and I hope we will never have an
other. Whoever heard before of a candi
j date for the greatest office saying, 'Of
course if I am elected there will be a
panic' Â§
"What, is panic? We had one taste of
j it in 1893. and it cost the country $3,000,
--| 000,000. When we get another what will
become of us?"
Miss A?:ka H. Shaw will speak at People's
party meeting, Union Hall, Howard, near 3d,
Thursday eve., Oct. 29. Everybody welcome.*
SACRAMENTANS CURER BUDD
I Shout for the Governor, but Xot for Ora
tor Bryan.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 28.â James
H. Bndd was greeted this evening by one
of the largest assemblages that ever gath
ered within the confines of the old pavil
ion. It was largel3 r composed of leading
and enthusiastic Republicans, who had
gathered there to do honor to California's
Governor and not to the political prin
ciples he advocated.
When the Governor was introduced by
Gillis P. Doty, who officiated as chairman,
it was fully five minutes before lhe cheer
ing ceased. Then arose the wild whoop of
the little band, sixty strong, of Sacra
mento Iroquois braves, and again the
audience arose en masse and cheered for
Budd.
When the name of Bryan was uttered it I
was different. A few snrill yells from
the Iroquois were answered by a feeble
cheer from the Oak Park delegation and
straggling yells throughout tbe hall.
In speaking of Hon. Thomas B. Reed,
the Governor said he was a statesman, the
j ablest statesman of the day. and an honest
man, but the one man in the United States
to-day who opposed everything that
California wanted, and he protested
against any attempt which might be made
by this able orator to dictate to tbe people
of tbe Slate.
SAN JOSE'S GREETING TO REED.

REDWOOD CITY, Cat,.. Oct. 28.â Alfred
J. Marcus, who was a candidate two years
ago for Railroad Commissioner from this
district, is anxious to vote. He went cto
Europe for bin health last May and did
not return until this month, too late to be
placed on the great register. On August
8 he instructed his attorney in fact to have

clined to permit, holding that Marcus

nish his own affidavit and not that of his
attorney. : Late this evening a writ . of
mandate to compel the clerk to put
Marcus' name on the register was issued.
The matter will come up before * Judge

.Monterey Bay, Oct. 2S. )
If Captain Howison were going to heave
his anC'ior and steam overland to shell
General Weyler out of Havana the officers
and men of the battle-ship Oregon would
not be drilling more indefa^gueably than
they have since the ship put to sea from
San Francisco Bay last Sunday morning.
The men nev?r know when they are going
to be ordered to fall in, but when the order
does come (and it usually comes with the
suddenness of an alarm gong, and some
times with the same shock) the marines
and the sailors grab their pieces and rnsh
to their stations with an alacrity that
clearly shows that they take a real interest
in the business of preparing for war in
time of peace. They also take a real pride
in keeping the pride of the navy in fine
condition. As the Oregon swings ernce
fully in Monterey Bay to-day in fifteen
fathoms of water and sixty fathoms of
chain to its anchor, it is almost the same
spick and span ship, clean as a hound's
tooth, that it was when it rested like a
duck on the waters at the Union Iron
Works. The tramp of feet, the heavy
thud of the butts of rifles as they fall to
the deck at order arms, the sonnd of the
lixxra or the bugle's clear blast are heard
on the ship almost continually.
The Oregon escaped perhaps the worst
part of the storm Monday night, but en
countered enough of it to let the ollicers
mil crew see how the battle-ship would
behave in the green fields where the sea
horses graze or lash their white manes
furiously. This, after it was all safely
Dyer, was an unexpected piece of good
luck. The commanders of naval vessels,
no more than merchantmen, will steer
jut of their course to meet a gale of wind
md waves 113 high as hills, but the new
battle-ship having shown that it will have
:o be a much heavier storm than played
havoc with the Bister ship Indiana to
:ause the Oregon to feel any serious
?ffects, its officers were pleased to see how
itiffly it stood up in the blow. During
;he third watch and about 1 o'clock the
â eas came over the decks aft. One man
laved himself from being washed over
joiird from the main deck by catching the
*ail on the farther side. The Oregon was
juilt as a coast defense vessel more than a
seagoing ship, but its experience on its
irsi cruise shows that it will take a very
liard blow and a heavy sea to cause even
my really perious discomfort between
iecks. it is claimed that it would be im
possible for the battle-ship to "turn tur
tle," so that the people may know that
the Oregon as It stands to-day, costing
them not less than |3,878,200, is safe in
Â»ny sea with plenty of water under its
bottom.
When it first pnt to sea on the present
jruise Captain Howison, remembering
Lhe recent experience of the Indiana, bad
the lorward and after 13-inch guns lasted
with 73^-inch hawsers to the forecastle
md quarter-deck bitts, so that they would
not swing and play smash with* tilings,
fhere vas no necessity for lashing tJie
suns, but he did it to experiment as to
tiow it could be effectually and quickly
accomplished in case of necessity. The
turret locks are different from those of the
sister ship, and it is claimed they are
strong enough to hold them fast under the
lame circumstances.
Captain Howison to-day stated that he
bad come out to practice and try the ship
it sea, to have alt the drills and exercises
it sea and particularly to run the main
sngines; that the ship was forty-eignt
jours under way and the engines never
topped except by signal from the deck,
md that was not given except in the exer
:ise of "man overboard."
In connection with this exercise a funny
ttory was told in tie >vararoom mess tit
he expense of Admiral '"Old Dick" Mead.
Vboard ship there is a broad distinction
>etween officers and men. Admirnl Mead
>nee fell overboard from the flagship. The
â¢ry at once went up, "Man overboard!"
L'iie bluff old admiral was swimming his
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
best and sputtering the salt water from <
his mouth. He found room enough to ;
shout back to the man who gave the '
alarm :
"You lie, yon lie, you; it's an
officer 1"
Captain Howison said the guns and all
the appliances and everything aboard ship ;
work splendidly â that he had no trouble
in any way. If the Oregon were to be re- (
buifc, he said, he could suggest some im
provements. He never saw a ship's crew,
officers and men settle down to drill and
business quicker than the Oregon's. This
is a high compliment. Captain H. L.
Howison is the ranking senior captain in
the navy. He has had long years of ser
vice. When Admiral Walker retires under
the age limit next March a vacancy will
be created and Captain Howison will be
promoted to a commodore. He will then
probably be removed to some other 3t
tion.
For the reason that it was found ad
visable not to lower the steam cutter it
was decided not to have a battalion drill
on shore to-day. This mi'itary spectacle
and the unique navnl one of an attack by
torpedo-boats on the ship at night will be
reserved ior Sausalito, whpn the battle
ship drops anchor there on the return next
Friday or Saturday. It wiil lay off Sausa
lito several days. The attacks by torpedo
boats will be made something after the
following fashion: Two or three steam
cutters wiil be sent out. They will hide
in the night and take their time. Sentinel
boats will be stationed at a certain dis
tance around the Oregon. The steam cut
ters will try to come within the sentinel \
line. These cutters represent the torpedo- ,
boats of the enemy. The object is to
catch them before they get within a cer- ;
tain distance of the ship. It they get i
within the line they flash a blue light and
are supposed; to have won, and the Ore- i
son, officers and men, to have been blown
into a thousand fragments by a torpedo.
If the fenlinel boat sees them first they
burn a red light and the torpedo-boats are
supposed to have been captured and
harmless. As the programme now is to
sail for San Francisco 1 0-morrow evening
this exercise will harly be held here.
This morning the marine guard had a
physical exercise with guns and an ex- ,
tended order drill, in command of Cap
tain Barry man ami Lieutenant Davis.
The battalion drill was under small arms. <
General quarters were abandoned. The
big turrets of the 13-inch and 8-iich guns
are working more smoothly and becoming
more responsive with the practice. The
crew is learning to handle the 6- pounders
of the secondary battery as eaMlv as a
small arm. From the present efficiency
of the practice the Oregon will be tit to
engage a whole fleet of Spain or the Sul
tan ot Turkey when it again swings to its
anchor in San Francisco Bay.
In the general quarters drill last night
the ship was ready for battle in 8 minutes
and 55 seconds. This is considered excel
lent time considering the practice the crew
has had. The crew was sounded to general
quarters at 8:37. The men rolled up
their hammocks, stored them in their
proper places, got to their stations, cast
Joose the guns and had them loaded in ,
the time mentioned. The ammunition
must come up by elevators from the
magezines far below in the ship.
Tbe searchlight drill at 7:30 o'clock last
evening brought out almost the entire
population of Monterey and a jrood pro
portion of that of Pacific Grove. The
four powerful searchlights were in opera
tion at the same time. The Ardois sys
tem of signaling by coiored electric lights
was flashing aloft on the military mast, in
charge of Ensign R. McLean, who is sig
nal officer. One of the signals flashed by
the lights and successfully read was this:
Send boats to receive Ammunition for 1500
military rifles and transport it to the Oregon,
lying off Monterey.
This message embodied all the different
codes used with the Ardois system, which
has been adopted by the navy compara
tively recently.
The statement that one of the search
lights picked tip a pelican resting on the
water and followed him while flying
through the night illustrates the facility
with which the searchlights ore operated j
nnrt their efficiency in picking up and Jol- |
lowing a torpedo of an enemy fired at the !
Oregon.
W hen a torpedo is picsed hd under ;
these circumstances the six-pound Hotsch
kiss rapid-firing guns open lire on it or its
line o' direction with the purpose of ex
ploding it before it strikes the ship. This
requires a quick and steady fire, as a
torpedo can travel thirty miles an hour.
Being safely anchored last night
the captain turned in early for the
lirst time in sixty hours and slept as
sweetly as a new- born babe until the sooth
ing voice of the siren was sounded at 7
o'clock this morning to see if its throat
was clear. It was.
To-day the regular drills went on as
nsual. This afternoon a gangway vras
lowered alt nnd there was a swarm "of vis
itors from Monterey and Pacific Grove on
deck and between decks. Early this \
morning the mercury fell to 46 deg.
The bay wa3 siaooth, the weather bright
and clear, and there was a considerable |
swell outside. |
OUT IN FULL WAR PIT
The American Railway Union
Going Earnestly Into Pol
itics.
It Will Bitterly Fight Its Old Enemies
and Work Hard for Its
Friends.
The American Railway Union proposes
to make itself felt in politics this year.
The members of local Union No. 345 have
recently been canvassing the various can
didates for municipal offices for the pur
pose of ascertaining their various quali
fications for the office to which they aspire.
Those who during the railway men's
times of trouble manifested a friendly
spirit to tbe cause of labor will be wel
and substantially remombered next Tues
day. The others will be remembered, too.
The menrocrs met last evening to dis
cuss the political situation. Several other
trades unions had to participate in the
debate and seven labor bodies were rep
resented.
The meeting was strictly secret and
candidates were commented upon freely.
After considerable discussion a preamble
and resolutions were adopted. In the
former, Superior Judge John Hunt was
denounced as being too favorably dis
posed toward the big railway corporations.
In conclusion it appeals to all labor
organizations to assist in defeating Judge
Hunt and Carroll Cook at the coming
election. A
The resolutions are as follows :
Resolved, That we earnestly indorse the can
didacy of the Hon. Horace Philbrook for the
office of Judge of the Superior Court in this
City and County, and that we earnestly appeal
to all our fellow-workmen to join -with us in
securing tne election of a true and consistent
friend of the working peopleâ a man who is
not afraid to stand fearlessly And tirmly by
his clients when they are in trouble, and
whose disbarment by the Supreme Court of
this State was a monstrous piece of judicial
operation.
Jiesolved, That we impress upon every work
ingman trie absolute necessity of making the
election of Mr. Philbrook not only certnin, but
overwhelming, in order that we may show
that the laboring man stands by his friends.-
Heiolred, That we earnestly indorse the can
didacy of Judge IleObard for the office of J udge
of the Superior Court in this City and County,
and that we earnestly appeal to all our lellow
workmen to join with us.
Jiesolved, That we earnestly and heartily
support the candidacy of Cord H. Weijen,
who, when our fellow-brothers were under in
dictment, was our flrm and consistent friend
and supporter and we heartily recommend him
to our fellow-workmen as wholly worthy of
their suffrages.
Xcsolvcd, That we earnestly indorse the can
didacy of Ci^orge W. Elder for the office of
Superintendent of Streets, and that we
earnestly appeal to all our fellow-workmen to
join with us in securing the election of a true
and consistent friend oi the working peopie.
In a second resolution tbe A. It. U.
takes a slap at the Populists in this way:
Whereas, The late alleged Populist conven
tion of this City and County sold out the
entire legislntive ticket to the corrupt political
bosses, and in doing so left the Populists and
their jriends among the working people with
out a ticket that they could wnolly support;
ond whereas, there are four Populists upon the
legislative ticket* who have been nominated
independently by petition, to wit: Hon. Cal
vin twinir, Hon. Clinton Hutcnins and the
Hon. P. L. Archibald for State Senators ond
Dr. F. M. Tuly lor member of the Legislature.
Senolved, Timt we heartily Indorse the ran
didacy of the Hon. Calvin Ewing for State Sen
ator for tbe Nineteenth Senatorial District.
Jiesolved. That we heartily indorse the can
dldscy oi lhe Hon. Clinton Hut>:hins for State
Senator in the Twenty-first Districr.
Jietolved. That we earnestly support the can
didacy of the Hon. P. L. Archibald for State
Senator in the Twenty-tnird District.
Jiesolved, That we indorse the candidacy of
F. M. Tuly in the Thirty-ninth Assembly Dis
trict for member of the Legislature.
Resolvtd, That we call upon all of our friends
among the worfcingmtn and Â«mong tnose who
are engaged upon the transportation lines,
both upon the street railroads and upon the
regular railroads, to do all in their power to
secure the election of these Jour men.
hetolved, That we denounce the trade by
which the Populists' legislative nominations
were turned over to the tender mercies of
Buckley and Rainey.
Death of J. Z. Davi*.
Jacob Zeigler Davis, the well-known mem
ber of the firm of Boyd & Davis. capita;i-ts,
died in Philadelphia earlj- yesterday morning.
Some time ago Mr. Davis', friends urged him to
make a visit to Ills native city, believing that
the change would be a benefit to his health, as
he had been sorely depressed since the death
of his wife, which'occurred on September 10.
The couple had lived most happily together
for 43 years und when she parsed away her
loss proved a great shock to Mr. Davis. The
latter's friends were sorely grieved to learn
that Mr. Davis too had joined the great ma
jority.
A Neighbors' Testimonial.
An open-air meeting, known as the "Keigh
bprs' Testimonial," will be held on Green and
Larkin streets to-morrow evening, in honor oJ
B. Fehnemann, Non-Partisan candidate for
the Assembly from the Forty-first District.
The affair will De iv the nature of a novelty, for
there will be a parade of children, concert,
band music, reeitaiions, songs and speeches.

largest audience he ever addressed and
San Francisco will go it a lew thousands
better.
We can count for McKinley thirty-three
States, and if it were not for the bourbons
of the South the electoral college would

The National canvass is already bright
with the picture of victorious Repub
licanism restoring prosperity to the
' American people.
The only persons of National note who
are supporting Bryan are Altgeld, Tillman
and Henry George. That fact is in itself
enough' to condemn him.
â¢ Bea-r in mind that to make Republican
success complete we must elect not only
the National ticket but the legislative
-ticket and the City ticket as well.
. The Republicans of Boston have struck
a good scheme. They propose to wind
up Banner day with a "bonfire night,"
-.and have speaking all around town.
Bryan began his campaign by trying to
browbeat honest money advocates and
ends it with a whine of coercion, so he
evidently struck something bigger than
' he expected.
... California workingmen will never vote
for depreciated money in ihe payment of
wages. They do the best work in the

'money in the world.
The people of this country were never
so eager to vote as now, and since they
have to wait until next week it is not
strange that they keep up a big shouting
to relieve their feelings.

The Democratic depression has Indeed
produced a great deal of discontent
among the people, but it has been a dis
content with free trade and not with
sound money, as tin Bryanites think.
REED IN CALIFORNIA.
Tom Reed began his address in Los An
geles by saying: "For the first time in my
life I find myself facing a multitude so
great that it seems to me an absolutely
hopeless task to attempt to reach one half
of it." It seems clear from this statement
of the speaker and from all reports that
come to us that tne audience which
greeted the great orator at Las Angeles
was the largest that had ever welcomed
him in the whole course of his long and
distinguished career.
The reception given at Los Angeles was
typical of California. Nearly every citi
zen of the State will feel a glow of pride in
learning that on his arrival within our
borders and in the first city in which he
spoke Mr. Reed found the most cordial
weicome of his life. That, is what Califor
nia intended to give him. LoÂ« Angeles
has but expressed the sentiment of the
whole State. We are gratified to learn
that the metropolis of the south so well
manifested the admiration and the love
which we feel for our distinguished leader
in the cause of protection and of American
honor.
Wherever he speaks in California Mr.
Reed will find a welcome equally cordial.
The audiences may not always be so large,
but the entliusiasm will be nonetheless
evident. The people of every section of
the State honor the great leader of the Re
publicans of Maine in whom they see a
successor to Mr. Blame, not unworthy of
his office, and whom they yet expect to
elevate to the great office of President of
the United States. California, whose loy
alty to Blame attracted the attention of
the whole Union, is hardly less earnest in
her admiration for his great successor,
and wherever he goes in this State he will
find evidences of this manifest in every
way which men have of expressing their
thoughts and feelings.
The culmination of Mr. Reed's recep
tion in California will be in this City.
What was done in his honor in lios
Angeles was but a preliminary to what
will be done here. San Francisco will
eive him a welcome in which all California
will take part. He wiil find our streets
adorned with banners and crowded with
applauding thousands. He will come to
us to receive a triumph such as has been
accorded to but few men in the history of
the City. It is even possible that he will
be met with a display of welcome equal
to that which greeted General Grant on
his return from a voyage round the world.
The people of California are by nature
enthusiastic. What they feel they delight
in expressing. They feel for Mr. Reed the
devotion which loyal soldiers in a great
cause feel for the leader who has the
genius and ability to compel victory. They
recognize in the coming of Mr. Reed a
harbinger of the coming of complete suc
cesÃ for the Republican ticket and all that
it stands for in this campaign. Their
welcome to him therefore will be a demon
stration of patriotism such as will give
him just pride to remember, and be for
ourselves a memorable event in the his
tory of our City.

LET THE COUNTRY COME IN
The great rally of the friends of Ameri
can prosperity in this City on Saturday
should by no means be contin d to the
people of San Francisco and its suburbs.
Men from all parts of the State should at
tend it and take part in it. Those who
live in Central California at any rate
should make it a point to be present.
Special trains are to be run for the
benefit of visitors from surrounding
towns, and as many as possible should
take advantage of them. We count on
making the day the most notable in the
history of California politic-*. We wish
tne people from the farms and the interior
towns to come in and help swell the num
bers and augment the enthusiasm. We
wish them to have their share in the wel
come to Reed and the grand demonstra
tion of patriotism.
The call of San Francisco goes out to the
people of all the State. Come in and join
the big parade, have a voice in the shout
ing, eaten the inspiration of the leader
ship of Reed. The glory of the coming
victory will be visible in the streets on
that day and audible in the triumphant
acclaims of the mass-meeting in the even
ing. There will be room for all and a wel
come for all. Let the country come in.
If we go to the free coinage of silver
we release all our gold ; it goes to the
gold-standard countries ; we are left on
the Mingle silver standard. Oar gold
going to the gold-standard countries
relieves the pressure, if such a pressure
exists, from a lac < of gold. They have
our gold and we have passed from the
rank** of the great civil lzt-d nations to
the companionship of Mexico. ami China
and Japan. They are not our natural
allies in business or In finance or in
political economy. Therefore the road
to destroy all hope of true bimetallism
is for this country to go to the silver
standard.â Senator Lodge.
BANNER DAY.
It is very evident that the fusion man
agers have been frightened by the deter
mination of the Republican party and the
conservative Democratic support of Mc-
Kinley. Thoy are afraid to stand up and
be counted. They are even afraid to per
mit the patriot element of the country to
be counted. Therefore, when Mr. Hanna,
chairman of the Republican National
Committee, called upon all supporters of
McKinley and Hobart to fly the National
flag on Saturday they made haste to urge
Bryanites to do the same.
The object of the Bryanite managers in
this movement is too evident for any one
to be deceived. It is clear they foresaw
that the display of the National flat; on
bouses of business, offices, shops, factories
and homes would be so universal on that
day that the followers of Bryan would be
disconcerted and discouraged by the
manifestation of public opinion. To
guard against the effect of the display
they have called upon the Bryamtes to
take part in it. By this transparent trick
they will enable their orators and organs
to declare that the universality of the dh
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1896.
play of the National flag was no proof of
the extent of the popular support of the
Republican ticket
The fusion managers are welcome to
whatsoever profit they may derive from
these tactics. The banners displayed on
Saturday will on the whole express the
patriotism of the people, even though
there be a few Bryanites here and there
who will float the flag merely to cow
their partisan discomfiture. A day in
which patriotism is manifested and the
National banner is everywhere set forth
to arouÂ«e the loyalty of the people cannot
fail to have a good effect even if some in
sincere people happen to join in it. It will
bear witness to the fact that even agitators
are compelled to respect the patriotism of
the country, and that even the boldest of
mischief makers dare not go so far as to
defy the resolute expression of the people
in favor of National Honor and National
integrity.
We have no objection to urge against
the appeal of the Examiner oi yesterday
that Bryanites should unite witn Repub
licans in displaying the National flag on
Saturday. Let the banner wave from every
building along the line of march. Letthe
people of all parties show their enthusi
asm for it, their love for it and their loy
alty to all that it stands for. Whatsoever
arouses patriotism among the people can
not fail to help the cause of National honor
on election day.
Th? supporters of McKinley and Ho
bart will not grudge anything that any
man can gain by displaying the flag of his
country. The extent and degree of pub
lic devotion to the cause for which the Re
publican party stands lo this contest will
be made amply manifest by the great pro
cession of the day. There will be no
Bryan hearts beneath the McKinley but
tons borne in the parade, nor will there De
any Bryan voices to join in the great shout
of welcome to Tom Reed in the evening.
The people ot thin country love It;
they leve its honor, if they had not
loved it, If they had not held its honor
In priceless esteem, they would not
have nent out these great arm'es In the
civil war, that it* flag might not be
stained. They loved it so that men
died for it, with the light of glory in
their faces, as the light of life went out.
They loved its honor and they kept It
whole. They loved its honor commer
cially and they will not have this Gov
ernment put in a position of repudi
ating one-half of its just obligations.â
Benjamin Harrison
RALLY, REPUBLICANS.
The argument of the issues before the
people is exhausted. The campaign of
education is closed. All that is at stake
in the contest bas been made fully known
to all who are sufficiently interested in
public affairs to care what happens to the
country. The duty of Republicans during
the closing days oi the campaign is the
simple one of rousing the energies of the
people and making sure that every right
thinking man will be sufficiently true to
his convictions to cast his vote on election
day.
Three issues confront ns; to carry Cali
fornia for McKinley and Hobart, to elect
Republican legislators who will conduct
State affairs with economy and good judg
ment, and elect a Republican to the
I nited States Senate, and to elect men to
administer the affairs of the city who will
secure to San Francisco those administra
tive reforms which are so necessary to our
mpnic pal progress and the welfare of citi
zens. To achieve these things the full
Republican vote must be brought ont for
the whole ticket, National, State and mu
nicipal, and to that end the ttctivities of
every loyal Republican should dp directed
from this time until the ballot-box is
closed on election day.
It is hardly necessary to urge upon any
intelligent citizen the importance of put
ting California on the side of protection
and sound money. The experiences of
the last iour years have made it clear that
our industries are dependent upon wise
legislation at Washington. Democratic
legislation in the past has been disastrous,
an<: Biyanite legis ation in the future will
be ruinous. Hardly more is it necessary
to point out the importance of electing to
the Legislature men who will send to the
United States Senate a Californian vho
truly represents the people and the inter
ests of the State. Equally clear is it to all
men of pood judgment that the municipal
affuirs of San Francisco require a careful
and able administration, and that in this
election we must run no risks in the elec
tion ol Mayor and Supervisors.
From now on every earnest Republican
should do all in his power to rally the
members of the party and honest-money
Democrats to the support of the Republi
can electoral ticket, the Republican legis
lative ticket and the Republican munici
pal ticket. To make success certain all
along the line a vigorous and aggressive
fiiiht will be necessary. The combina
tions against good municipal government
are strong. The fusion of Populists and
liryanites organized for the purpose of
controlling the Legislature and electing
Cator to the Senate is not to be despised.
The united vote of all good citizens will
be necessary to make the municipal gov
ernment and the Legislature as surely
Republican as will be the electoral ticket.
To that end, therefore, let every man
work.
GOVERNOE BUDD'S BLUNDER.
In his recent speeches delivered in this
City and elsewhere Governor Budd ap
pears to have added himself to the list of
thosa who believe that loyalty to Bryan
requires thim to counsel electors to dis
honesty and disloyalty. He advisesâ nay,
even insists â that employes whose politi
cal convictions impel them to vote for
Bryan should, nevertheless, take part in
the great Republican parade of next Sat
urday for the sole purpose of deceiving
tbeir employers into a belief thai they will
vote for McKinley.
This is a sort ofadouble dishonesty which
it is most singular that Governor Budd
fails to understand. It implies, in the
first place, a want of manhood and integ
rity on the fflfc of employes, which it is
impossible to believe of any considerable
number of workingmen. When the Amer
ican employe reaches that condition of
wretched slavery our American Republic
will be a failure indeed. It is not easy to
believe that Governor Budd and those
whom he Imitates in this indictment
of American manhood seriously believe
what in the heat and despair of the cam
paign they have been tempted to say.
The Governor's suggestion of cowardice
and subserviency in American employes is
equaled if not exceeded by his insinuation
of utter and most contemptible meanness
on the part of American employers. He
puts them in the attitude of watching the
passing of a great political parade for the
purpose of discovering which one of their
trusted assistants they will discharge, be
cause, forsooth, in his political action he
chooses to be a man. In other words, the
Governor would have those who employ
labor adopt the rule of preferring false and
cowardly employes to honest and manly
ones as their aids in the achievement of
business success.
Nobody knows better than Governor
Budd that hi 3 words are a grQss and out
rageous slander of California employers,
nor does any one understand more per
fectly than he the entire absence of such
unworthy motives in those who have sug
gested and of those who will compose the
great procession of Saturday next. We
had hoped that senseless and slanderous
utterances such as Governor Budd has
emitted would be confined to that
portion of the East through which men
like Eryan, Altgeld and Tillman have
been making their lurid way. There may
be some excuse for such wild and foolish
statements from the lips of men who
dominated the Chicago convention, and
whose only hope of political eminence
lies in the success of its candidate. The
Governor of California, however, ouebt
not to lower himself to the level of these
men, nor diminish the measure of that
esteem with which he has been regarded,
by indulging in suggestions which are as
discreditable to himself as they would be
dishonorable to anyUne who might be in
duced by his advice to adopt them. When
Governor Budd returns to the executive
chair, from which he has been reluctantly
drageed, he will douatless regret the in
dulgence in language which is as un
worthy to himself as it is distant from the
truth.

Stocktov, Ca..,Oct. 26, 1896.
A PLEA FOR SUFFRAGE
Woman's ability to do certain things has
been questioned from time immemorial, and
the propriety of. her doing many tilings has
been still more contested. Everything outside
tne beaten path which her grandmother trod
is considered out of her sphere. Year by year
she has broken down the barriers which
closed to her some avenue of advancement,
and at the present time she is preparing to
take the next forward movement, a step
which will make her the political equal of
man.
We have been told that we are not intelli
gent enough to participate in governmental
affairs, but when we bring forward evidence
that more women are educated than men. that
more women than men can meet the educa
tional requirements oi our constitution, then
we are totd that book-lear ing does not count,
that it is the "rubbing with the world" which
man considers the greatest educational fac
tor, wliicn we lack and which he strenuously
tries to prevent us from get ing.
To b- sure, when the argument suits his
purpose, man argues that tin- public school is
the greatest factor for civilization in this
country, but u>ls must nit be turned to ac
< ount in behalf of woman. It will always be
conceded that no hing bo tends to advance
civilization as ih educat.on of a people, and
if this c:Â»n only come through "rubbing with
the world" wtiy not admit women to this
ereat school of learning?
It will, however, be a difficult thing to con
vince most women that the ignorant men with
whom they come in dail> contact are better
fitted for citizenship by their "rubbing with
the world" than are the women by the m ntai
training given in our public schools and the
reading of the literature of the day. Our boys
and girls have exactly the same courses of
study in our school-;; tney read science of gov
ernment and political economy together, and
when the girls can look forward to taking a
practical part in the government, then will
their interest in these lines continue and ex
pand.
We will cheerfully admit that our brains do
not equal man's in size, and that the blood
with which they are supplied Is of poorer
quality; but, after all, we seem to have been
able to do our full share of the world's work,
and we feel that man can safely trust to us Â«n
equal voice in making the cond.tlons under
wuich we must live. We are inspired by the
same patriotism, love of duty , and sense of re
sponsibility that fills the breast of every man
as he anticipates citizenship. We huve entire
faith in the merits of our i>lea, substantiated
as it is by the altogether satlsiactory experi
ence where woman suffrage has been in prac
tice for years, and we believe thai our prayer
will be granted on the 3d of November.
Cannot tne men of California realize that we
wonie are thinking, feeling, suffering, aspir
ing human beings; thai we are dist.net per
sonalities, having a deep rtsionsibiliiy as to
the character of the individual we turn out to
be; that we have the same loyalty to our coun
try; that we in. ye the same laws to obey; that
we have the same government to maintain Dy
the same method of taxation as applies to
men? We have a greater interest in the home
life, which is acknowledged to be the lounda
tion of the nation; we have a keener interest
in the children and all that affects them; we
have greater porsonal;interesu to protect, and
yet we alone are compelled to think, feel,
suffer and aspire to obey, to sustain and to
maintain in silence, deprived of all voice in
regard to any of the conditions which affect
us equally with and sometimes more than our
broiaers, and which are altered by legislation
from which we are excluded.
Shall this condition longer remain? Shall
the wives and mothers, the faithful women of
this country, continue to bettieonly disfran
chised class, except the morally and mentally
deficient? We simply ask you to put yourself
in our place and then apply the golden rule,
and we know there will not be a man of you
but will vote "Yes" for amendment No. 6.

SHUTTING OUT FOREIGN IDEAS.
Thomas B. Reed at Chicago.
I am very proud of the United States. I
have been all over it and have some idea of
its greatness. But there is one kind of a great
ness oi the United States that I am not at all
proud ofâ 'hat which makes out of us a gi
gantic cowboy just come :o town, with a de
sire for vermilion and a determination to
make everybody dance, not because they aro
pleased, but because they are scared. When,
therefore, I hear men in ijrominent positions
sneering at ideas upon the sole ground that
they are foreign I feel a reasonable amount of
distrust of such men.
I remember, among other things, that this
country, so far as '.he people are concerned,
did not invent iruelf. In fact, we were all of
us import-'d within the last 300 years, and one
of the most singular facts connected with this
contempt cf foreign financial policies is the
fact that the very men who expressed this
contempt have adopted and nearly ruined
this country by a free trade policy which was
not only invented in Great Britain, but is con
fined to that country at the present time ex
clusively.
ARE THESE NOT "REGULAR ?"
Boston Herald (Ind. Dem.l.
The list of emineut Democrats who are at
odds with the Democratic party in its present
attitude on the currency is an impressive one.
At its head is Grover Cleveland, and following
are John G. Carlisle, William L. Wilson, John
M. Palmer, Simon B. Buckner, Edward J.
Phelps, Thomas F. Bayard, David B. Hill,
Rosweil V. Flower, George H. Gray, William
F. Vilas, Donelson Caffery and Calvin S. Brice.
Nearly all the above are in official positions
now in the party. The list might be greatly
extended to include those not in public life.
In our own State there would be found in it
President Eliot of Harvard University, Dr.
William Everett and a long array of men dis
tinguished for disinterested politics. No one
will fail to remember in this connec ion the
lamented Governor William E. Russell, the
last public act of whose lite was an attempt to
save to his party the standard as regards the
currency which has been ruthlessly snatched
from its hands.
THE FARMERS AND THE TARIFF
Treti ton Gazette.
It may be that a protective tariff would not
benefit the farmers of this country, but we
have facing us the fact that since the McKin
ley tariff was destroyed the yearly sale of
wheat in the United States has fallen off 150,
--000.000 bushels.
Corn, 430,000,000 bushels.
Barley, 1,000,000 bushels.
Cattle. 215,000 head.
Hay, 220,000 tons.
Eggs, 1,400.000 dozens.
Cheese, 2,400,000 pounds.
Wool, 115,000.000 pounds.
Potaioes, $22,000,000 worth.
It seems as if the destruction of protection
must have had something to do with this
shrinkage.

Brisbane, Queensland, expressing deep sym
pathy with his bereavement and at the same
time congratulating him upon the lucky
escape from the wacery deep. -My opinion is
his survival would not have been greatly en
joyed by him, Knowing his wife to be drowned.
"The origin of the above report is perhaps
found in the fact that there has been a ship
wreck reported in the London papers as having
occurred on the coast ot France, and this re
port being copied in Australia it accidentally
found its way into the editorial rooms of the
Musical Courier. The only survivor bore the
name that my husband and I are known by,
and as the Morquardts were extensively adver
tised in Australian papers during our concert
tour, this report has been connected with tne
Marquardts who are now enjoying perfect
health in San Francisco."
The Musical Courier has correspondents at
Hoboken and Elmira and other towns, which
do not figure on maps of the world. It never
condescends, however, to print any San
Francisco news. If it did it would have learned
long ere now that instead of playing a celes
tial ham Mrs. Marquardt has been playing here
for several months past to the great edification
of San Francisco concert-goers. Henceforth j
we shall take the obituary notices in the |
Mu6ical Courier with several grains of salt. |
Considering how prominently Mrs. Marquardt
has been before the San FranciÃCo public
during the last few months a musical journal
that professes to give the new 3 ought to be
better posted than to give her obituary.
"Art is long but time is fleeting" receives a
sad exemplification in the case of poor
Smetana. His opera, "The Bartered Bride,"
promises to be the rage in Europe this winter,
and the Bohemians are so proud of their com
patriot that at Prague a medal has jast been j
struck in nis honor, which is haying a tre
mendous sale all over Bohemia. One side of
the medal presents the portrait of Smetana,
with the National Theater of Prague in the
distance, and this legend, "Art is victorious."
The reverse of the medal bears representations
of the two fia nces of "Tne Bartered Bride" in
their national Tz^ch costume. "Art is victori
ous!" but poor Smetana died ten years ago in
a lunatic asylum, broken-hearted because his
music could obtain no recognition.
"The Bartered Bride" has just been pro
duced with immense success at the Imperial
Opera-house of Vienna, and the Princess de
Metternich, who induced Napoleon 111 to give
"Tannhauser" its first Parisian represen
tation, which ended in such dire fiasco, is
using every effort to induce the direction of
the Opera Comique to mount Smetana's opera.
It was the dream of the poor Bohemian com
poser during his lifetime to have his work pre
sented to the Parisian public, and in order to
i make it more acceptable, he added some ballet
music and divided it into three instead of two
ac.s. It is this "Parisian ' version which is
being played in most of the German theaters,
so if Smetana's dream came to nothing, his
efforts to secure its realization added to his
posthumous glory.
"The opera season is beginning," says a
writer in Le Figaro, "and theater-goers should
be on the lookout for that odious being who
is too often met with in audiences. He has the
piece at bis lingers' ends, and sings it with the
artists, very often before the artists, for the
bonhomme has plenty of vanity, ana he wants
to show his neighbors that the score has no
secrets for him. He iB generally a stout, rubi
cund gentleman, who adores sentimental
things. He sings at you'Connais tv le pays?'
or 'Laisse moi contempler ton visage,' first
humming it to himself, then xnezza voce, then
iorte, and finally fortissimo. At the end of
ten minutes you want to throw a seat at him.
One evening, at the Opera Comique, a long
suffering spectator was sitting alongside one
of these nuisa ces. 'Richard (. ceur-de-Lion,'
which is about 100 years old, was the opera,
and the nuisance was humming all the airs.
The long-suffering spectator saw a chance for
revenging himself on the old gentleman.
Turning to him, with the most amiable air, he
said: '1 presume, sir, that you were present
when the piece was first produced.' "
An important document concerning J. S.
Ba< h has just been discovered. At Dornheim,
a little village in Thunnjsia, the following in
scription in the register of the Protestant
church of the village has been brought
to light. "The 18th October, 1707,
the Very Honorable Sieur Johann Se
bastien Bach, the celebrated organist
of Saint Blaise at Mulhouse, legitimate son,
surviving his father, the late Very Honorable
Sieur Ambroise Bach, celebrated organist of
the town of Eisenach, and the virtuous
demoi-elle, Barbe Bach, last legitimate
daughter surviving her father, late the Very
Honorable Sieur Johann Michel Bach, cele
brated organist of Joht'en, have been married
here, in this temple of God, with the permis
sion of our nob c lord, after the publication of
the banns at Arnstadt." The church of the
village was according to this document under
the patronage of the lord of the village and
his consent was necessary before a marriage
could take place there.
"Since My Little Baby Brother Came to
Stay" is one of the hits of the new edition of
"The Babes in the Wood" at the Tivoli. It is
cleverly sung by Elvira Crox Seabrook. The
composer, Miss Gertrude R. Spel an, is a San
Francisco young lady who has considerable
tiilent for writing music. Sne left her song at
the Tivoli without exercising any influence in
its behalf. Tne manuscript was tried over,
and was found to be. so taking that it was de
cided at once to incorporate it into the "The
Babes in the Wood."
William H. Keith, our California barytone,
now in lonaon, has been winning new laurels.
He sang by special appointment before Wolff
at Berlin, the great concert impresario, man
ager ot such artists as Sarasate, Sembrich and
Josef Hoffmann. "Keith has one of the love
liest voices I have ever heard," Wolff writes a
fellow-impresario, "we have nothing like it in
Germany, and his training is of the best. He
is a most excellent artist." Keith will sing in
Berlin during the coming season.
The Grand Ducal Theater of Weimar has just
adopted an orchestral reform devised by Rich
ard Wagner. The floor of the orchestra has
been lowered by over a yard for the wind in
struments and by over half a yard for the
strings. The representation which was to in
augurate this reform was unfortunate, how
ever. First "The Flying Dutchman" was an- j
nounced, then the aflicbe was changed to
"Carmen" and the theater was crowded, but
several artists disappointed at the last mo
ment and the money had to be given back.
Poor Levi, the celebrated Wagnerian chef
d'orchestra, although not positively insane,
as he has often been reported to be, has been
forced through ill health to tender his final
resignation from the Royat Opera of Munich, j
The new conductors appointed in his place are '
Erdmanr.bdoerfer and Ricnard Sirauss. The
latter musician is still young, and has written
a number of remarkable works.
Mile. Lola Beth, who made a semi-fiasco in
New York with the Metropolitan Opera. Com
pany last winter, has jast signed a contract
with the Imperial Opera-house of Vienna for
five years, beginning October, 1897. The
year, tilt the contract begins, is to be filled in
with foreign engagements, many of which are
already made. Beth is a great favorite, both
in London and Berlin.
Three Parisian theaters have been Imploring
Charles Lecoq to grant them permission to
revive "La Fille de Mme. Angot." After
taking some weeks to consider which would
do the thing most handsotr.ely, the maestro
has given permission to Les Bouffes to revive
the work.
Mme. Gaveaux-Savatier, a concert singer,
famous during the early years of the second
empire for her beauty and her talent, has
just died in Paris. Although frequently im
plored to go on the stage, she always refused
to appear in anything Dut concert.

penses, but the crew, having chipped on a
"lay," will have to content themselves
with $1 a head.
Captain Coffin brings back with him a
pathetic story about a successful hunter
and miner who died whii^ on his way back
to his El Dorado. He was discovered in
the hold of the Rosario when the schooner
was well out to sea, and as he was a con
sumptive the officers took pity on him
and gave him light work. He appreciated
their kindness and worked well until the
Arctic was reached. Then he succumbed
to the severe cold and was buried at sea.
Ben Roze was the name of the deceased.
Yean ago he was a hunter and miner in
Alaska. He did well, and year after year
added to his store. His mine was a good
one and money poured into his private
board. Finally he sold out his hunting
business, but nevpr revealed the position of
his gold mine. With about $35,000 in his
ponKetÃ he came to San Francisco and for
a few months had what whalers and seal
ers call "a good time."
After spending about $20,000 he pur
chased a saloon on Market street and there
went into business. For a time Roze did
fairly well, and then the bills of his whal
ing, minine and hunting friends kept
growing. Finally be sold out the Market
street business, and with his remaining
dollars he estanlished himseli on Pacific
street, near East.
11l luctc or bad debts still pursued him
and finally Roze lost his latter possession
and every cent he had on earth besides.
It was then that he resolved to stow away
on the Rosario and once more work the
mine that had once before yielded him a
fortune. His intention was to co into thÂ«
ice with the schooner and then strike
across the continent by a route which he
knew. Roze was confident of success and
promised every man and boy on the
Rosario a share of his money when he
reached San Francisco again.
Unfortunately many weeks before the
Rosario reached Point Barrow RozÂ° was
taken sick with consumption and before
the headland was reached he was dead. A
funeral at sea is always a sad affair, but
t is one was particularly so. Every mem
ber of the crew knew Roze and all were
his friends, in fact the supposition is that
some one among them heipefi the miner
to stow away. Captain Coffin read the
burial service ov*>r the remains and the
body was consigned to the deep.
"Ben came to me several days before
we sailed and wanted to ship on the
Rosario," said Captain Coffin yesterday.
"I knew him well and wouid have given
him work, but then he was a physical
wreck. I had to refuse him, even though
the tears did come in h.s eyes. He as
serted that if he could only reach the
Arctic he could make money as a hunter
and then make his way to the Yukon. I
laughed at him, but he persisted, and
finally I came to h-'lf believe in bin mine.
"As there was no point at which we
could land him, we had to take Ruze
along. He was tne most willing worker I
ever saw, and his faith in the gold mine
he had left years ago, and which he ex
pected to reach again, seemed to buoy him
up. Nevertheless he failed day by day,
and when he died he was as thin as a
skeleton. What delicacies can you expect
to find on a whaler? But even though I
say it, the stowaway, Ben Roze, had the
best the ship could produce."
The Rosario was taken direct to Oak
land Creek, and all who attempted to
board her were towed away past Goat
Island by the tug Alert. This makes the
second whaler that has gone into the
creek to "lay up" indefinite. y. The Wil
liam Baylies and the Rosario are now
anchored side by side, and many more
wilt keep them company before the year
is out.
The steam whaler Kar/uk also got in
from F<>x Island last night with 3000
pounds of bone and one sack of fur.Â«. Sue
brings the news that two of the crew of
the Jeanette who attempted to escape
from the vessel were shot by the officers
and killed.
At one time t'ero was a general exodus
of the whalers toward the Yukon, as
chronicled in The Call some weeks ago,
and some of the deserters were hot and
some escaped. Two of the Jeauette's

crew were among the men who met an un
timely end.
Captain Wing brines word that from
the very latest reports the Orca had five
whaler and the Narwhal one or two more
than she had on last report. All the fleet
that wintered at Herschel Island went to
the westward and expected to make a big
catch similar to that of. last year. They
were disappointed, however, as heavy
eales prevented, and they were driven
back to their winter quarters. Very few
of the whalers will pay expenses this" year.
DO MAURIER'S "TRILBY."
The Marine Journal >ays No Vessel Has
Ever Been Named After the Mas
ter's Creation.
Monday's southeaster brought in a fleet
of vessels yesterday aiternoon. Three
British vessels, two whaiers and quite a
number of coasters got in before dusk.
Th* Britishers were the Mayfield and
Wanderer from Newcastle, N. 8. W., and
the Semantha from Shanghai. The two
former came here in ballast on account of
ihe strike in the Newcastle collieries, while
the Semantba brings a general cargo. All
three are sure of charters, as the demand
for wheat in Europe, Asia and Australia
is on the increase.
The "new woman" has become a marine
reporter. She went out to the Point Lobos
station yesterday and explained to the
observer lor the Merchants' Exchange that
she was on that "detail from the Ex
change." She wanted to use the telescope,
examine the books and generally run the
place.
The observer demanded her credentials
and as she could not produce any the
"new woman" was gently but firmly
ordered out of the premises. Abe Marks
of the Exchange, who furnished The Call
with the description of the sailing of the
Acapulco, is anxious to know wno the
"new woman" is, but Â»be observer at
Point Lobo* refuses to give any details.
"George Dn Maurier, the author of
'Trilby,' has died without the honor of
any ve-sel, so far as we can ascertain,
having been nampd after his popular
heroine," says the Marine Journal. "Yet
for a vessel with a typically beautiful
. forefoot it ought to be a mascottish cog
nomen."
What's the matter with the stern
wheeler Trilby ot San Francisco? When
she was launched a few months a.o at
i North Beach her "typically beautiful fore
foot" stuck in the mud and it took two
tides to get her off. Then how about the
barge Sveneali? The latter was tied up
in Mission Bay last August and the Trilby
carte along in the dark and ran into it.
' The Trilby s and Svengalis in the bay of
! San Francisco are certainly not things of
, beauty, still we h;ive them.
The Oceanic Company's Monowai will
; take away almost as large a cargo as the
Mariposau Over 100 tons of canned goods
| awaited her arrival, and since then 'he
merchandise has kept jjiiinjr up. Over
1000 bicycles will go away on her and
hops, wheat and general merchandise will
crowd tne vessel.
Tne French bark Lamoriciere, after dis
charging her ballast at Main street, has
been placed on the drydock. During the
' run here from- Valparaiso she sprung
a leak and an examination showed that
reveral rivets were sprung and that a gen
eral overhauling was necessary.
Some months ago the engines and
boilers of the stern-wheel steamer Frank
Silva were taken out and replaced with a
gasoline apparatus. On the first trial there
was an explosion, but fortunately no one
was injured. Repairs were made and
another trial took place yesterday. It was
a success and in future the Silva will be
propelled by gasoline.
During Monday's i-ale the schooner
Glendale went ashore near Selby's smelt
inc works. She was loaded with lumber
for the Port Costa Lumber Company, but
was in a safe position. The steamer Sunol
of the Piper, Aden, Ghoodall Company
came along and in answer to the signals
on the Glendale went to her assistance.
The schooner was towed off and put on
the right course for Selby's.
The big 13-inch gun for Lime Point is
noÂ»v lying on a barge at the foot of Fol
30m street. Accompanying it is a donkey
engine, which will be used to land the big
gun when Lime Point is reached.
Tne first load of stone for the new ferry
depot arrived yesterday. It will only be
a few weeks when the iron worK will have
so far progressed as to make it possible for
a beginning to be made on t c stonework.
In the meantime the Commissioners are
viewing the subject from all points of in
terest.
Colonel F. 8. Chadbourne of the Harbor
Commission returned from the East yes
terday. He says that New York has no
wharf that can compare with Pacific-street
wharf iv this City and that McKiniey is a

The tug Fearless, three days from Na

REGULARS ARE
SURE OF WINNING
The Regular Assembly
Nominees Are More
Than Sanguine.
Opinions of Men Who Have
Canvassed Their Dis
tricts.
A BE PUBLICAN TJ. S. SENATOB
Voters Ari Almost Unanimous in
Placing the Legislature in
Republ.ca i Hands.
At this stage of the fiprht each candidate
has made a careful canvass of his district,
and from such he is in a position to fore
shadow the result of next Tuesday's
ballot.
In the Twenty-eighth Assembly District
there are six candidates in the field.
In speaKing of the winner, William
Kennerson said:
"I have canvassed this district thor
oughly, and therefore I am in a position
to say that I will be elected. This is not
because I am more popular than some of
the others who are running, but because
I represent the regular Republican party
and U>e principles of McKinley."
Much the same sentiments have been
expressed by James E. Flynn, t c regular
Republican nominee for the Twenty
ninth District. He said :
"I believe I know as much about the
majority of the voters in the Twenty
ninth District as any other man, and from
this knowledge I speak. I am sure of
being elected. While I admit that some of
the other nominees are popular, yet this is
not the question before the voters. It is
wno wil best assist in carrying out the
policy of the Republican party. To assist
McKinley we must have a United States
Senator from California who belongs to
the Republican party, and to insure this
the voters have every confidence in my
voting for such a man. Hence you
can easily see that the party from
whom 1 got my nomination is the straight
Republican party, and that is the chief
reason way I will be elected."
Henry M. Kelley, the regular Republi
can nominee for the Assembly from the
Thirtieth District, said:
"Since I received my nomination I have
made a curetul canvass of this district, and
from what I have learned I have reason
to believe I will without question be re
turn- d to the Assemi>ly trom the Thirtieth
District. My constituents are chiefly
property-owners, who own their own
houses, and have therefore an interest in
the welfare of the country. They have
had enouch of Democracy for years to
come and will vote for the straight Re
publican nominee. I am the only
regular nominee whose credentials are
genuine and to which party the people
can look for protection and a revi/al of
the good times they had when the Repub
lican party had control of the general
Government."
The Thirty-first District, as canvassed
by T. J. Sullivan, is solid and sound for
McKinley.
'I have made a thorough canvass of my
district," said Mr. Sullivan, "and I am
more than certain that I will be elected by
a handsome majority. The voters of the
Thirty-first have had sufficient of free
trade and dull times, and with this bitter
experience they don't want a continuation
of Democratic policy and ruination."
Jeremiah Lucy, the regular Republican
nominee for the Tnirty-second District, is
equatly certain of his election. His dis
trict is in ha bitated by hard-working, in
dustrious men, who know from experiÂ»nce
what it is to be thrown out of employment.
He said :
"I have not a little bit of doubt left in
my mind but that I will be elected
i ands down. I have talked with hun
dreds of ihe voters in the Thirty-second
District and I find the great majority of
them to be in favor of McKinley and the
nominees of the regular Republican party.
Hence my election is assured because I
represent the policy and principles of this
great party."
â¢â¢You ask about the Thirty-third," said
R. Rasmussen, the nominee for the
Assembly on the regular Republican
ticket. "Why this question seems to be
almost useless. What? The Thirty-third,
where the men are all mechanics? Surely
those men are not foolish enough to vote
away their bread and butter, which tbey
will be doing if they vote for Mr. Bryan."
The Thirty-fourth Assembly District
will afford an easy walkover to P. D.
Code Jr.
"I have not the slightest doubt in my
mind," uaid he, "about the Thirty-fourth
District. I have been born and raised
right here among the people of this dis
trict, and I consider I know what I am
speaking about when 1 say that I will
most assuredly be elected.
"The voters in this istrict are an intel
ligent, thinking people, and as such they
have watched the effect of Democratic
free trade and free plunder for the past
four years. They have had enough."
C. L. Hedemark of the Thiny-filth As
sembly District, in answer to the question
regarding his chance of Deing elected to
the Assembly, said:
"Tuere is no chance about it. The peo
ple of the Tnirty-tilth District are for u>e
Republican party.
"It is not men but measures with the
voters of this district."
William H. Gieeson, the nominee of the
regular lleuubucan convention, said,
when a^ked for his opinion: "My district
is somewhat large and scattering, and as a
consequence it ha.- taken me some time to
get over it. But I have done so and am
consequently in a position to give expres
sion to my experience. I am very coafi
dent of being elected to the Assembly
from the Thirty-sixtti District.' 1

IS NOT CHANGED
BY HIS SILVER
Though Owner of a Big
Mine He Will Vote for
McKinley.
Ex-Secretary P. L Shnman on
the Necessity of Pro
tection.
SEASONABLE HEN WANT IT,
Great Changes in the Mining Districts.
Illinois Democrats Never Won
Except by a Fluke.
P. L. Shurnan, for many years on the
staff of the Chicago Evening Journal, bat
for over a dozen years past engaged in im
portant mining enterprises, now owner
of elading properties in Calaveras
County, is at the Palace. Mr. Shuman
has been referred to as at one time Lieu
tenant-Governor of Illinois, but this is in
correct. It was his uncle, the venerable
editor, Andrew Shuman, who occupied
that position.
He is one of the principal owners of a
large silver mine in the mountains of
Conejos County, Colorado, and he was at
one time a heavy owner in the famous Jo
Davis silver mine at Leadville. His mine
in Conejos County was paying well till
the depeciation came in the value of
silver. When the white metal fell below
80 cents an ounce he couli not work the
mine. At 85 cents and above, he could
make a handsome profit. Nevertheless,
he does not believe it to be for the good of
the country to have free silver, though &n
it is it costs him about $3000 a year to have
the mine looked after while it is closed.
Mr. Shuman does not let his personal
interest in silver mining change bis views
as to what is good for the country. He is
an unflinching Republican and will vole
the ticket as usual.
|fe"So lar as I can learn," he said Tuesday
night, "every man who really understands
how much better it is to have protection
than to vote tor Mr. Bryan and free silver
wiJl oast his vote for Mr. McKinley. Men
everywhere who have any property in
terests are doing this. Ido not believe irom
what I Know of Illinois that there can be
the least question as to how that State
will go. I predict it will roll up an enor
mous majcritv for McKinley. Chicago
will go for him by 50,000.
'â¢ Only on two occasions did Illinois go
Democratic in recent years, once when
Altgeld was elected, and another time
previously, and both times it was not be
cause there was a lack of Republicans, but
because there were local differences that
made some of the Republicans record
their vote as a protest. That was all. The
Democrats did not hold that vote. They

will not do so this year. That is why I
say Illinois will go for McKinley.
"It is wonderful what a change bas
taken place in California mining regions
for McKinley. In the west part of Cala
veras the voters are almost unanimously
for him. Elsewhere in the county it is
much the same. Even the Democrats are
for him. At Angels even, despite that it
is Mr. Lane's own town, I think it is
doubtful if he gets a majority for Bryan.
The change is remarkable. I estimate
that the State will go for McKinley bj
5000or6000."

a heavy track,: although little mud was
flying. Of the mix event? run off lavorue*
in the betting more than held their own,
capturing four. Betting in the ring was
of the livcli'St sort, there apparently be- I
ing no scarcity of coin among those specu
lating.
Starter R. D. Hovev\ who seems to have
completely mastered the iriiricacies of the
Australian gate, sent his fields away in j
beautiful order without perceptible delay.
Of course the $1000 oronirg day handi
cap took precedence over the other num
bers on the programme. There were six
acceptants' with rugged little Installator
a pronounced 7 to 5 favorite in the ring, j
Ti e track was evidently not to his liking,
lor he never looked dangerously like a |
winner, finally|endinc up just beyona iiy
part of the money. Green Morris Sir
Play, with Jones up, a 5 to 1 chance, led
the field from the jump|ind won handily
by a length from Wawona, with 30 to 1
about him. Damien, carrying Fat
Dunne's colors, and second choice in the
betting, took show honors, not being yet j
able to show his real form. j
Sam riildretb's good colt St. Lee pulled |
a race out of the coals and no mistake in '
the opening mile and seventy yard run. I
Strathrol, a new horse in these parts, at
first held the place of honor in the bet
ting, but he soon gave way to St. Lee, who
was hammered down from 3 to 2 to 4 to 5.
He was a poor last at the lirst turn, but
overhauled one after another of the six
starters and in a hard drive beat Strathroi
out a scant head. Mamie Scott showed ,
tbe way to the stretch.
The Burns and Waterhouse filly Alma
appears to have the "Indian sign" on Lou
Lou R, for she again repeated the Oak
land defeat of a few days ago in the five
and a halt furlong dash for two year olds, j
beating her out cleverly by a neck. The
winner was 7tor> in the betting. Dolore,
heavily played, was third.
Edward Cprrigan's jumper, Captain
Rees, was a top-heavy, even-money choice
for the mile and a half hurdle affair, but
appears to have not yet gained )m sea
legs, for he finished a poor third. Colonel
Weightm&n, with Andy Blakeley op,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1896.
took the lead after passing the stand, and,
galloping in front, won somewhat ex
tended at the end from the fast-coming
.T O C. The Colonel's supporters got 6 to
! 1 lor their money.
Starting a 11 to 5 choice for the filth
I event at six and a halt furfones (Jaliente,
! a good son of El Rio Key, worked up
i from fifth position at the start, and,
| showing the way as the bend for home
was reached, downed Hazard, a 10 to 1
shot, very cleverly at the wire. Alvardo,
the second choice, refused to break when
the barrier went up and was left.
The ti fl y and festive Libertine was in
fine fettle yesterday, and the concluding
seven furlong spin was a juicy plum for
him. Going to the post 1 to 3, he galloped
the head off Caesarian, beating Mr. Sink's
horse out easily, although' the latter ran a
race not to be sneezed at. The time,
1:30 J^, was excellent.
Notes.
The California Jockey Club yesterday
passed a resolution deciding to acce.pt the
entries of Will Wallace. The club is in
receipt of a letter from the young horse-
man in which he states l>e has a letter
from August Belmont informing him 1
that he is not ruled off, and that the re
jection of his entries applied only to the
Kew York tracks.
Jockey AI Shaw was yesterday re
instated by Oaptnin Rees. He will sign to
ride for Jim Neal.
Thirteen penclllers marked up odds in
the betting ring.
Rudolph, who was to have ridden
Huntsman in the hurdle race, could not
find his boots and was fined $25 by the
judges. The horse was also scratched.

FINALLY FILED A REPORT.
Southern Pacific Complies With the
Kailroad Ccnnmisafon'a Order.
The Railroad Commissioners have waited
since last August for the annual report
from the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany, and now they have really received
it and aie agreeably surprised, for the act
of submitting a report is an undeniable
acknowledgment by the railroad company
of the right of the commission to de
mand it.
The report is for the year ending June |
30, 1896, and, though it shows but a small
profit, it is a satisfactory improvement
over that of tho preceding year, which
closed with a deficit.
Following are the summaries of the
revenues and expenses:

Ogden : Passenger departmentâ Passenger reve

FRIENDS OF THE
CHARTER GATHER
Meeting Last Evening in
the Odd Fellows'
Hall.
Vigorous Speeches in Defense
of Its Various Pro
visions.
MISUNDERSTANDING CLAIMED.
Speakers Say Ti at Its Provisions
Contdin No Discrimination on
Religious Grounds.
A meeting in favor of the proposed new
charter was held in Odd Fellows' Hall
last evening. Very earnest speeches ex
olanatory of its provisions were made by
Dr. Taylor, who presided, William F.
Dohrmann, Albert Lyser, James Denman
and Henry N. Clement.
Dr. Taylor said that "rot" was the only
word that could describe the statements
that have been made by those opposed to
the new charter at their meetings to the
effect that the instrument would destroy
self-government.
It was proposed by the charter to give
to the Mayor the power to appoint such
officers as now are appointed by the Gov
ernor. It seemed ridiculous that on any
such basis as that any one should say
that the new charter woul.il destroy the
local republican form of government.
The consolidation act had been amended
by more than 400 statutes until it was
without form and practically void.
The real question now was whether the
people would rise to the level of good citi
zenship. Oiher charters had been pre
pared and had been defeated by /raud.
All the corrupt elements in the City were
arrayed against this charter. Good citi
zens had unfortunately put themselves
in opposition to it and so had endangered
its adoption.
William F. Dohrraann explained the
work of the Citizens' Charter" Association.
The charter was of the people, by the
people and for the people. It was a long
step in the light direction. At the char
ter convention 152 organizations were rep
resented by delegates. Every association
Hi the City* having an honorable purpose
was invited to send delegates. The friends
of the charter have tried to make a cam
paign ot education.
Some of those who oppose it had made
a campaign of vituperation. There had
been an attempt to scare salaried officers.
Some people had thought that they saw
religious tendencies in the charter, but
the instrument had no religious bearing
and was non-religious and non-partisan.
Lazy and indifferent citizens have been an
obstacle in the way of success
James Denman said that he favored the
charter because he was in favor of good
government. He favored the new charter
because the one existing was worn out.
It has been outgrown with the growth of
ihe City. The City was governed from
Sacramento and not by tbe citizens, and
for this reason he favored the new char
ter. As a member of the City government
he had tried to prevent the multiplication
of clerks in the Ci.y Hall. He went to
Sacramento to prevent the appointment
of more clef k?, but be failed.
He afterward tried to prevent the ap
pointment of two clerks in the Coroner's
ollice. A Senator told him that he was
opposed to extending the clerical service,
but this Senator nevertheless voted for the
appointments when the bill came in.
The new charter would provide a way to
get out of the financial snarls into which
the municipality has commonly fallen.
This year the school-teachers would have
their salaries partly withheld, owing to
the way the funds were arranged. Under
the new charter the fund from which
school-teachers were paid had been segre
gated.
He could not see how any school-teacher
could oppo3e the charter, taking into view
that one consideration alone.
The best thing about the charter was
that it would bring about civil service.
He was not surprised that "the push,"
the City Hall and politicians opposed the
instrument for that reason.
There should be a paid Fire Depart
ment, and the charter provided for that;
and tbe Police Department should be
taken out of politics.
Albert Lyser, principal of the John
Swett Grammar School, spoke particularly
of that part of the charter which refers to
the public schools. Out of $I,2so,ooo raised
last year for the public schools, from
$300,000 to $500,000 had been squandered.
The City had oeen governed on the
principle of divisionâ the schools to get as
little of the money as possible and "the
free companions" to get as much as possi
ble. The system of government was bad
and needed amendment, and the new
charter would furnish a better system.
The tenure of office of school-teachers
was at the mercy of the Legislature and of
local authorities under the consolidation
act. There were no provisions in the
charter which could discriminate against
Catholic teachers. All that was provided
was that the teachers in the two lower
grades should have soma ' professional
training. No discrimination was intended
against any sect or denomination.
Henry N. Clement said that all the crit
icism against the new charter had cen
tered on two or three point?. The more
important objections were that the Mayor
was given too much power and that it
proscribed teachers on account of their
religions belief. Both of these objections
were absurd in view of the real facts of the
case. The Board of Freeholders con
tained people of all shades of relijrious
belief.
The committee that reported the portion
of the charter referring to the public
schools consisted of cne Methodist, one
Theosophist and one Catholic. A com
mittee of the Charter Association called
upon Father Yorke when fir3t he objected
to the charter, and told him there was no
discrimination on account of religion.
Father Yorke said, so .Mr. Clement,
continued, that if this were so he had no
objection to the chatter, but he would con
sult his attorney, Robert Y. Hayne. An
opinion was written by Mr. ilayne, whicn
on this point reached the same conclusion
aÂ» the legal committee of the Citizens'
Charter Association. Still Father Yorke
opposed the charter on the ground that it
discriminated in a religious way.
The facts about the powers conferred
on the Mayor are that the Mayor would
simply name the officers who have been
named by the Governor, and also three
o tliers only.
The meeting closed with an announce
ment by Dr. Taylor that adjournment was
taken to the polls on Tuesday next.
Veterans' Cumpflre.
The executive committee of the Union Vet
erans' Patriotic League held an executive
meeting Tuesday afternoon at 2 o'clock at the
Auditorium, to hear the reports of the various
j committees. Among those who were present
were: William J. Ruddtck, D. M. Cushin. C. M.
Leavy, C. D. Douglas, Manin Murray, Edward
Onlen and Major Whitfleld. The "chairman
of eaictt committee made 11 progressive report.
The secretary cal!ed,Â«ttention to the fact that
he had inadvertently stated that the ramp tire
would be held at tne Auditorium when it was
really Intended to have been held at B. B.
Hall, 121 Eddy street, which was butter adapt-,
ed for h campfire, and as tnerc was no gallery
there would be no ladies admitted.
NEW PESTHOUSE.
A Hospital for tontajjiom -Diseases to
Be Located on the City and County
Hospital Lot.
The Board of Health settled the ques
tion as to where the Peathouse is to be lo
cated in a summary manner yesterday,
the recommendation of the Hospital Com
mittee that the building be located within
the City and Comity Hospital grounds
beinpt accepted without a dissenting voice.
Dr. Hart, chairman of the committee,
stated that the decrepit old Pesthouse had
been examined and that it was beyond re
pair, lie said i hat to spend money on it
was to waste public resources.
Dr. Williamson offered a resolution, that
was passed by the board, instructing the
Superintendent of the City and County
Hospital to select a site on the hospital
grounds in the northern part for o new
building to be known as the hospital for
contagious diseases. He was also ordered
to have plans and specifications for the
structure drawn up at once.
Health Inspector Stout recommended
that the buildings at 43 Jessie street, 182
Stevenson, 52 Natoma and 19 Clementina
De condemned and destroyed. He also
recommended the condemnation of the
shanties on the lot at Fell and Broderick
streets.

MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
The Tabers Give an Interesting
Performance of " Twelfth
Night"
Laughter and Tears ill " Tennessee's
Pardner" at the Colombia
Theater.
Theatrical managers are resigned lo
their fate this weak, lor on the eve of a
Presidential election it i3 scarcely to be
expected that the theaters will draw as
usual. Some of the houses are doing a
satisfactory business, but on the whole
the audiences are slim.
"Twelfth Night" received its first pro
duction during the present engagement of
the Tabers at the Baldwin Theater last
night. Robert Taber gave a finished and
interesting piece of acting a9 Malvolio.
Like Henry Irving he took the part seri
ously, making the poor duped steward a
gentleman, whose delusions and disillusions
arouse at leant as much pity as ridicule. One
is ? o used to seeing Malvolio burlesqued into
a mere buffoon tdat.it was a treat to find the
role acted with delicacy and intelligence.
Mrs. Taber was a delightful Viola, natural
and simple and intensely in earnest, as. usual.
The end of the cast was well acted. That
mischief-loving trio. Sir Andrew, Sir Toby and
the festive maul, succeeded in winning plenty
of responsive laughter from the audience.
The parts were played by llawley Francks, G.
W. Anson and Katherine Wilson respectively.
"Tennes3e's Pardner," at the Columbia
Theater, is a play in which Scott Marble has
been peculiarly happy in catching the delicate
human character-drawing of Bret Harte. Jane
Corcoran gives a caarmlng impersonation of
Tennessee Kent, the Eastern girl who comes
to sect her fatheT in the Western mining
camp, and finds that he has gone beyond
human ken, while his rough mining friends
had gone on writing to Tennessee and sending
her money, purporting to come from him. The
scene in which she is told ol her father's death
by Caleb Swan is full of natural, simple
pathoB. Indeed, there is a good deal ot this
sort of sentiment in the play, although it is
relieved by plenty of laughter.
"The Ugly Duckling" is in its last nights at
the Alcazar. Tne performance is a strong one
and has added greatly to the popularity of the
Alcazar stock compativ.
||Therei8 plenty cf startling action in Whe
Captain's Mate," whicli is winning applause
at the Grnnd this week. The play is well
staged and effectively acted.
The second edition of "Babes in the Wood"
at the Tivoli is very funny atid well deserves
the applause it is winning nightly.
All the new acts at the Orpheum this week
have proved successful, and the holdovers are
going as. strong as ever.
The California Theater opens on Monday,
November 9, with the romantic play, "Darkest
.Russia."
The second Sinrichs-Beel concert will be
given at the Baldwin Theater to-morrow after
noon. Signor Mlchelena having been com
pelled to leave for Mexico, Signor Abramoir
will be the vocal soloist.
MRS. BLINN THE WINNER.
She Gets the Woman Suffrage Lemonade
Set, With Votes to Spare.
For many days a handsomely de- 1
corated lemonade set has occupied
a conspicuous position in the head
quarters of the State Woman Suf
frage Association in the Parrott build
ing. It consists of a bowl and mugs, and,
under other conditions, might easily be
taken for a punch- bowl and its accompani
ments.
This lemonade set was donated by an
ardent woman suffragist for the good of
the cause, and the suffragists have been
voting as to who should bei.orne the proud
possessor of it. The result is just an
nounced. Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-itlinn is
the lady who has the most yotes, and so
she will take the Bet. The voting at the
close of the contest stood as follows:
Mrs. Austin Sperry, ISG; Rev. Anna Shaw,
100; Miss Susan B. Anthony, 121; Mrs.A. A.
Sargent, 122; Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-Blinn,
153. There were many scattering votes.
Mrs. Blinn is the vice-president of the
State Woman Suffrage Association.

STOLE ALMS FROM
THE POOR-BOX
St. Francis Wards Robbed
by Two Conscience
less Girls.
The Box Taken to One of Their
Homes and Broken
Open.
CONTAINED ONLY SIXTY CENTS
The Girls Are Ella Wcods and Win
nie Norton, the Oae 16 and the
O:her 15 Years of Age.
Two young girls, Ella Woods and Win
nie Norton, were arrested yesterdBy morn
ing by Policeman H. S. Hutchins and
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
burglary. Ella is 16 years of age and Win
nie 15.
Monday afternoon the "poor box" in
St. Francis Church on Montgomery ave
nue and Vallejo street was torn from its
fastenings and carried away. The police
were notified of the theft and Policeman
Hutchings was detailed on the case.
From information he received he went
to 527 Vallejo street, where Ella lived, and
placed her under arrest. He then went
after Winnie and found her on Mission'
street, near Twenty-eighth, on her way to
visit Her aunt, who lives at 5 Powell ave
nue.
The girls after being taken to the City
Prison confessed to Hutchings that they
had entered the church and stolen the
box. They took it to Ella's house and
Winnie broke off the Jid with an ax.
There was only 60 cents in the box.
Monday nigut they went out to Sunny
side and hid the box in a vegetable gar
den. Hutchings, from the location de
scribed to him by the girls, found the box
without difficnltv and it was taken to the
City Prison and booked asevidence against
the girls. Ic is an iron box and weighs
probably about thirty pounds.
When taken to the City Prison the girls
gave way to teers, but they soon recovered
their composure and their assurance of
manner. Winnie was particularly bold
and saucy and treated all inquirers with
scant courtesy. She positively refused to
say anything.
Ella was more tractable and after some
fencing she said: "Winnie called upon
me Monday afternoon and we went out
for a walk. When we returned my mother
asked me to <-o to the church, as my little
brother was very sick.
"Winnie went with me, and just before
we went into the church Winnie asked me
to let her wear my cape, as she did not
like 10 go into the church with her soiled
waist. She wore a jacket open at the
front. I gave her my cape and she gave
me her jacket.
"I was standing at the font, which is
near the entrance, talking to a Jadr when
Winnie went down the aisle to the altar.
She came back in a few minutes and I
asked her what she had under her cape.
She told me it was the 'poor box' and I
told her to eo and put it back. She walked
a few steps toward the altar, out some
men were there and she came back and
walked out of the church with the box
under her cape.
"I followed her and we went to my room.
Winnie got an ax <md broke open the lid
and took out the money. There was only
60 cents in it and Winnie kept it. I don't
know what she did with the box.
"I did not go into the church intending
to steal anything and did not know that
Winnie intended stealing the box."
Ella's statement that she did not know
wnat became of the box is opposed to
whÂ«Â«t Winnip told Policeman Hutcbings,
as she said E'la went with her to Sunny
side when the box was thrown into the
vegetable garden.
Winnie's parents live at 521a â¢ Fifth
street. Pier father got her a situation a
few weeks age, but she did not keep it
long. Since then she has been roaming
around at nights and getting her meals
from her aunt on Powell avenue.

jf r.i-Senato'h Charles N. Felton, who pre
jfded at 4 the â¢ meeting, introduced Mr.
6chooumaker, and in doing so, gained
jgreat applause by stating that he consid
ered McKinley's election next month to
be a certainty.
. Mr. Scboonmaker prefaced his remarks
. by saying that an eironious idea has ob
tained in California that he is ex-Con
gressman Schoonmaker of New Jersey.
He denied that such is the fact, and said
that, being a .newspaper man, he has
never sought "nor obtained a political
office. 'He said in part:
â  1 tnank yo.u for this real California wel
come. As some sort of compensation for it I
would like to make a great effort which would
gain me a reputation on tuis coast as an ora
tor. And now I'll tell you why I am here. I
â¢â  em here lii-jhe interest ol F. X. Schoonmaker.
I wouldn't give one snap ol my finger for the
ReDUbliean pvty as a party or for tiie Demo
cratic party as a party, lam looking, out for
my own interests and putting butter upon my
own bread.
If Mr. Br.yan and the Democrats could con
vince me tnaj it would be for my best interests
Co vote with them-you would find me lined up
with the Bryau shonters; but ' they have
failed to do tiiaf, and I am with the Republi
cans, for I am convinced that my best interests
â¢. lie with their success. AYe are all sharehold
ers in a great stock company, of which we all
have one share and in which nobody can have
< Wo.
Wo. have an election of officers once every
"Â»fonr- years, and at those periods the officials
# .\vhjo have been serving must give an account
'to the shareholders us t% what they have been
.doing. . Four years ago there was an officer at
'the head of this company and his name was
. Harrison. His policy was good and the coun
try'was DrosDerous. Then came the election.
A 'number of people wanted it changed.
â¢Why? Because, although the country was
â >}>ros'p*rous under tne protective policy which
ihey had'-obtained, they were told that if free
Â trade was mt.de the policy of the country Its
â¢presDeritv would be increased. Well, you
nave had that free trnde in a measure, and
â¢fiowi want to Â«sÂ£ you how you like it? Since
th,e'iirue of that election things have chanced.
The gr-eat leaders of labor in the United
â¢ State* my that during the last four years there
â  ri-ave been discharged jri the United Slates be
tween 4,000,000 and 5,<J00,000 skilled laborers.
JWnen the iaotories ate closed other men are
throwu out of work. The railroads do not
cinploy'so many. And in a hundred different
i' i\ ays the employment of laborers Is affected.
â¢ "that in all", 7.000,000 of men who had
ii orked before 18i>2 have during tne last four
years lobt their-rueans of livelihood.
What does the discharge of those 7,000,000
â  of .men mean? Everyone of these men sup
ported five other people. Thus in tbe last four
. years 35,000,000 of Americans have lost their
means ot livelihood.
â¢ The Government reports show that during
that period 180,000,000 bushels of wheat less
.were consumed than .during the next four
*j - ears be tore.
TiMH means -that to-day many people in the
Eas* tL'ank God if they can get a dry crust of
bread to eat. They are so poor that they have
â¢not .had the money to buy the bread which
should, have been produced by that 180,000,
--â¢000 bushels of wheat, and the non-consump
tfon of that quantity of wheat means the loss
'â¢ to its producers, the Western farmers.
Now, what is a.protective tariff.? It is noth
â¢ .ing more nor less than a license fee which we
collect from foreigners who bring to this coun
'.try goods to sell wHich Americans raise or
make themselves. This makes the foreigner a
Vrapayer. If a foreigner brings a thing thÃt
Americans ne?d, but do not raise nor make,
we let him in free with It.
â¢It seems strange to me that a proposition so
clear as that can be discussed and gire rise to
{^difference of opinion among people.
Mr. Schoonmaker then gave a practical
â¢ demonstration of ''ths benefits which
accrue to American trade and tradesmen
be.cause of a protective tariff ; he went into
the history of the effort to establish the
glove business in his State, and told how,
despite the fact that there is a duty of 52
per cent on gloves, gloves- are to-day
cheaper by half than they were during
tbe days of free trade. The establishment
of the' American industry of watch-mak
ing was also gone into.
He .showed how, although there is a
duty of 35 per ceqt on watches, we can
now buy a better watch for $3 50 than you
could during the free-trade days for ten
times'thdt amount. .All this, tbe speaker
contended, is due to the competition ex
cited 'by the growth of protection-fostered
industry and impraved methods of manu
facture resulting tifion the fostering of
I th-at business. Then he went on:
I orm Bull is the .tramp peddler of the world.
I % has Australian wool and Canadian lumber
Xio sell to you. Then why not make him pay
ff.'s peddler's license? Why should wo bear
the burdens of government to provide a mar
ket for him in which he may freely and with
out stint share a'l our prosperity? Why not
make him pay his license at the Custom-house?
lii'the last year of Harrison's administration
there was. collected $200,000,000 in customs
â which was turned into the National Treasury
and the tax-payers of the country had just that
much less burden to bear. That is the whole
protection argument inja nutsheil and it seems
tome that it should be easy for any man to de
cide on which sid&he would array himseli.
The silver mam claims that the cnuse of the
hara tiinei.was tbe demonetization of silver.in
1873. Let' us look into the mutter. Up to
18.73 the business of the world was conducted
o.u eight billion do.lars of metallic money,
'four "biilions"' of silver and four billions of
.â¢ pold. "Then," he says, "a conspiracy of finan
ciers-took place" and silver was demonetized.
1 hal gave gold twice as inucn work to do,
made It grow twice as dear, be twice as much
In demand, and that eventually a gold dollar
tecame a two-dollar dollar."
" But was silver demonetized in 1873? was
the coinage of the .silver doilHr stopped in
1873?- It was not Deing coined in 1873 to any
"preat extent. The coinage of the silver dollar
was*stopped in 1806 by Thomas Jefferson, and
i.e. I have heard, was a pretty good Democrat.
Only 8,000.000 silver dollars were coined from
' 1792 ip 1873, and in 1878 the Republicans re
mmed the coinage of the silver dollar which
J'-fferson sopped in 180<i.
. fcluce 1878 we have coined 35,000,000 trale
dollar-, 430,000,000 Bland dollars, and 168,
--000,000 Sherman dollars, a total of 634,000,
-000. Now rememDer, silver was knocked out
.in 1873, Rnd we have done all this since
hllver was knocked out.
= bince we have stopped coining it we have
coined $634,000,000. This very year 13,000,
--000 of these si. ver dollars have been coined,
but, despite all this, the Populists say we have
stopped coining sliver. It seems to me that

-ISM I have here 100 pennies. The time never
wflbai the United States wnen 100 of these
pennies wouldn't buy a gold dollar. It has
never taken 101 pennies to buy one and one
never could be bought for 99. One hundred
pennies have always bought the gold and the
gold dollar.
If this be true, is not the statement that the
po'.d dollar is a two-dollar do:lar lie number 2?
Once a silver dollar could not be bought for
less than 104 pennies. To-day 50 pennies will
buy the silver in that Hollar' therefore is not

I tell you, my friends, hero is the silver
question in brief": You are asked to vote to
increase the value of silver. There are 33,000
owners of silver; 72,000,000 Americans are
asked to make silver worth twice as much
after election as it is now ior the benefit of
33,000 silver-owners.
The speaker then explained the reci
procity law formulated by James G.
Blame, and claimed that when McKinley
is elected that law will be again enforced.
He said tuat with its aid America can
force the nations of the world into the re
monetization of silver at a fair ratio with
gold, lrr conclusion he urged his feearers
to combine for Americanism as againsi
anarchism, an* told them that as they
had a 2ood thing in the protection policy
it seemed to him a good idea if they would
keep it.
CHEERING AT THE CHUTES.
West End Club Republicans Make
Things Lively for Their
Candidates.
The Republicans of the Thirty-seventh
Assembly District were the hosts last
night at the Chutes, where they gathered
thousands strong to welcome those candi
dates of their political faith who could ab
sent themselves from other engagements
long enough to drop in and ue presented
to the assemblage.
B. J. Salomon, president of the West
End Republican Club, introduced District
Attorney W. B. Barnes as chairman of the
evening! and the latter declared in his
opening remarks that he would insist
upon a five-minute limit being observed
by each speaker.
Charles L. Tayior, candidate for Mayor,
had a few words only to say. He was triad
to see such an aggregation of ladiÂ°s inithe
audience, and he prophesied that it would
not be long before woman suffrage would
exist in this Ftate.
"I believe," said he, "in suffrage being
accorded ednally, irrespective of coior,
creed, class or sex."
Mr. Taylor reviewed his forty years in
the ranks of Republicanism, beginning at
the time he presided at the meeting that
ratified the nomination of Abraham Lin
coln for the Presidency of the United
States.
He stated briefly thatif he were elected
Mayor of this C ty he would use every ef
fort to reduce taxes and see that the af
fairs of the City be administered on the
same principles upon which he conducted
his own personal affairs.
The speaker was strone in his assertion
that in importance the Nationai issues far
exceeded the local ones, and that the ter
rible failure made by tbe Democratic party
in the past four years shows how a radical
change is needed.
Hia concluding remark was: "With
out protection it is almost useless to till
the soil of California."
Police Judge Charles A. Low was next
introduced. He is a candidate for re
election, and tbe mere mention of his
name by Chairman Barnes brought forth
enthusiastic cheer*. The Judge, as did
Carroll Cook and Judge Campbell when
they were presented, said it was not in
cumbent upon a candidate for the
judiciary to mnke a political speed).
Judge Low stated he desired to have the
people within his hearing friendly and
just. He has done all in his power and
within his ability while on the bench to
care for their interests and he proposes to
continue doing so should he continue in
office.
Chairman Barnes introduced George W.
Elder, the nominee for Superintendent of
Streets.
Mr. Elc'er modestly bowed and retired.
But Martin Stevens, the attorney, recited
what he knew personally of the work done
by Elder as the expert for the Street Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors during
tbe past twenty-four months.
He pointed out that in tfiat time Elder
had saved $400,000 for the City and
managed to secure from the Grand Jury
seventeen indictments against the present
Democratic Superintendent of Streets.
The names of Judges John Hunt and
joacbimser. were mentioned and cheered
to the echo.
In turn the following well-known peo
ple paid their respects to the crowd : Wil
liam Deane, Edward Wolff, Anna Shaw,
J. R. Aiken and Judge Bonostell.
The Plumed Knights' Drill Corps, the
Thirtieth District Drill Corps, th*Â» Phoenix
Drill Corps and the Bear Cub visited the
chutes during the meeting.
C. L. TAYLOR SERENADED.
Young Men's Republican League
Honor the Cofninpr Mayor.
Colonel C. L. Taylor, the Republican
candidate for Mayor, received a genuine
surprise last evening, lie had delivered
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 29, 1896.
an address at the chutes, and spoke again
to the Scandinavian Reoublicans in
Pythian Castle, alter which he went to his
home at 709 Bush street for a much-needed
rest.
He was unexpectedly called to the door,
and there he met the Young Men's Re
publican League, out in its full force of
100 members, accompanied by a brass
band. Before he had time to realize what
it all meant the colonel was the recipent
of a serenade. For some time the band
played popular air?, the clubmen cheerinsr
heartily between pieces.
Colonel Taylor acknowledged the com
pliment and with his friends adjourned to
California Hail near by, where he ex
tended his thanks to his friends for such
an expression of esteem. Several other
short addresses were made, after which
the assemblage went to the banquet hall
and partook of a fine lunch that had been
provided by the club.
The gathering broke tip at midnight
with three cheers for Colonel Taylor, the
next Mayor of San Francisco.
Good music, good singing, good speaking.

LABOR MASS-MEETING.
Jam es D. Phelan Addresses the
Workingmen in Union Hall.
L'nionHalion Howard street, between
Third and Fourth, was well filled last
evening with the laboring element. The
occasion had been advertised as a labor
mass-meeting. On the stage acting as
vice-presidents were a dozen or more well
known trades-unionists. John McCartney
introduced J. W. Bean as chairman of the
evenine.
The first speaker was George A. Lafay
ette, the author of the melodrama, "La
bor's Temptation," that is to be produced
at the California Theater next SaturAy
evening for the benefit of the Building
Trades Council. His subject was '-Labor.' 1
James H. Barry made one of his char
acteristic speeches, which was well re
ceived. The principal speaker of the
evening was James D. I'helan, the
Democratic candidate for Mayor.
He discussed the National political is
sues of the day, after which he took up
the local situation. In language that
could not be misunderstood denned his
attitude to the American Protective As
sociation, after whicb he paid his compli
ments to Patrick Reddy, Joseph I. Di
mond and those who on the previous
evening "roasted" him in the same hall.
Mr. Phelan dwelt particularly upon the
corruption existing in the various mu
nicipal departments in tbe past and at the
present time.
The last to add to the entertainment
was Thomas C. Nayler of tbe Coast Sea- '

Senator Red field Proctor, who was for
merly Secretary of War, returned hore
yesterday after a week's stay in the
Northwest. He visited Portland and other
places in Oregon and then went to Wash

He was in the latter State only one day,
but he managed to see enough to con
vince him that it was all risjht for sound
money, McKinley and protection. As for
Oregon it is as safe as it possibly could be
expected to be.
Mr. Proctor spoke very confidently of it
to a Call representative yesterday, who
met him at the Palace.
"Oregon is sure for McKinley," said tho
Senator, with a loot that showed he was
absolutely convinced. "Thnt State is all
right. It has been looked after, and there
will be no question about its vote on No

"it is estimated that on a conservative
basis Oregon will be Republican by at least
10.000.
"I have seen the figures that have been
made up of all the counties. Oregon is all
rieht. I met Senator Mitchell while there.
He has done some great work in the cam
paign. There have been a great many
Republican speakers. They have been
speaking all t c time, and the condition
now is eminently satisfactory.
"There is gre.it interest in the campaign
in Portland. Everybody there is talking
politics. Bein>r a small place compared
with some other cities, everything is
talked over, nnd personal influence counts
a great deal more than in a large place like
San Francisco and yet larger cities.
"I went up to Washington, too, but.was
only thero one dsy, so I cannot judge so
well of it as of Oregon. Yet competent
judges assured me the State was entirely
safe. We will carry it, they say, by 15.000.
Four times as much work has been done
there as in any other campaign. I met P.
C. Sullivan, the Republican nominee for
Governor and member of the Republican
National Committee.
"He and other prominent men in the
campaign say that Washington will cast
her vote by the most emphatic sort of a
mujority for Mr. McKinlev."
Senator froctor will leave to-day for his
home in Vermont.

"THE KING" LAID AT REST
Frank McManus' Funeral Cor
tege the Longest in Oakland
in Years.
Many Beautiful Floral Tributes Tes
tify to the Popularity of the San
Francisco Celebrity.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 28.â The funeral
of Frank McManus, once "King of the
Potrero," took place this afternoon from
St. Mary's Church, Rev. Father Brown
officiating.
The funeral was one of the longest that
has passed through Oakland's streets,
while the sacred edifice was filled to the
doors with friends and mourners.
The remains were encased in a hand
some mahogany casket, with a large sil
ver plate in the center, on which were the
dates of birth and death of the deceased.
Of floral tributes there were many, the
most elaborate piece being a tall column
of white car nations, roses and chrysan
themums, over which a wreath of maiden
hair ferns were hung. Purple violets,
caught up with broad bands of ribbon to
match, heid ihe wreath in place. This
bore the card ot J. O. Reis.
J. B. McManus' final offering was a large
"Gates Ajar" made of carnations and
chrysanthemums.
A sheaf of wheat from A. K. Coin and a
pillow from Mr. and Mrs. P. J. Mo
ran were among the many other beautiful
pieces.
Tho funeral cortege str.rted from the
home of J. B. McManus, the deceased's
brother, shortly before 10 o'clock and pro
ceeded to the church. Alongside ot the
hearse waited (he pallbearers, who were:
D. McMann, J. McNarnara, D. W. Mona
hai, M. J. Moran, C. Wilson and G. H.
Hunt.
At the church Rev. father Brown con
ducted a solemn high requiem mass for
the repose of the soul of the deceased, and
then the long procession of mourners
slowly moved out Broadway to St. Mary's
Cemetery, where the last sad words were
said before the remains were consigned to
the grave.
That Frank McManus bad a host of
friends was certain, for the sorrowful
gathering to-day was very large. Many
of Oakland's business men and politicians
came to pay their last respects, while from
San Francisco a large number attended.
The deceased in life was very attentive
to church duties and took a great interest
in its affairs. It wns McManus who con
tributed the first $100 toward the founda
tion of St. Teresa's Church in the Potrero,
while on many other occasions h- made
large donations. There are many other
charitable deeds which will long be re- i
mem bored.
It is estimated that go)d and jewels
worth Â£8C0,000,000 are strewn along the
bottom of ttie sea on the route between
England and India.

THE BASIS OF
CITIZENSHIP
Lecture by Bishop Mont
gomery at the
Cathedral.
Religion, He Held, Is the Corner
stone of the Consti
tution,
HIS PATRIOTIC SENTIMENTS.
St. Mary's Filled to the Dcors With
Admirers of the Popular
Prelate.
There was a large gathering of people in
St. Mary's Cathedral last night, when the
Right Rev. George Montgomery, D.D.,
Bishop of Monterey and Los Angeles, de
livered a lecture on "The Basis of Ameri
can Citizenship." The lecture was given
to assist the Christian Brothers of Sacred
Heart College. Before Bishop Montgom
ery entered the puipit a beautiful pre
lude was played on the organ by Professor
Harrison.
The proposition which the lecturer
argued to a logical conclusion was that
religion is the basis of American citizen
ship. By way of introduction the Bishop
said that on the first thought it might
seem that the subject was not in keeping
with the sacred surroundings, but was out
of place, inasmuch as matters of a purely
Recular nature cannot be introduced into
Catholic pulpits. The view he took of it,
however, was that the subject was far
otherwise than secular. There was no
incongruity at all in speaking of citizen
ship in God's pulpit.
"Though we differ as far as religion is
concerned," continued Bishop Mont
gomery, "nevertheless we people of this
country have unity of faith. That unity
of faith is bei-t summed up in tbe word
'citizenship.' Inasmuch as we live in a
republic what is true of citizenship in any
other country is doubly true of ours. Re
ligion is the underlying principle of citi
zenship. If that be true in any
political body, Slate or society it is
doubly true in a republic like ours. The
troubie is the word citizenship has been
used so often with regard to its secular
side, people have come to think it
has no other side â that it has noth
ing holy in it; and the question of
separation of church and State has come
to mean separation ot religion and State.
There is not and there never can be a
separation of religion and State and the
Republic still remain as our forefathers
left it â utterly impossible. What is citi
zenship? It is the right to vote and hold
office, but we understand that right to be
civil and religious liberty.
"But this everlasting argument of sepa
ration of church and State has been
pushed to such an extreme by religionists
themselves, who are cutting their own
throats, that civil liberty owes nothing to
religions and religious liberty nothing to
civu liberty. There must ever be a sepa
ration of church and State, but not of re
ligion and State, for that moment we
cease to be the Republic of our forefathers.
In seeking this men have adopted policies
and forgotten principles. But the prin
ciples must be kept in view, for after all
the constitution is the basis of citizen
ship."
Bishop Montgomery declared that Goa
| is as much the author of civil government
:is of the church, and therefore civil gov
ernment is divine. Religion is its basis.
People have gone off on policies and for
gotten principles. They say that if the
policy is neglected the country is coing to
ruin. A says that if B wins the country
is going to ruin, and vice versa. In either
case, Bishop Montgomery argued that the
country is safe. One thing, however, he
held is s !i re if the principles underlying
the constitution were preserved, there
would be no basis, no need, for, policy.
The constitution is based on honesty,
conscience, right and the principle that
no man wants what does not belong to
him and is ready to give back what is not
his. That in where religion comes into it.
Even if a party on tbe road to ruin was
once in power, and had the principles at
heart it woula forget policy ; then honesty,
conscience, right would save it. Policy is
not framed according to the moral law,
and, therefore, the distinguished speaker
showed how necessary religion is to guide
the citizen.
"An honest despot," he said, "is prefer
able to a corrupt Democrat or a corrupt
Republican. An honest despot who be
lieves in the rights of others will rule
more justly than the Republican or Dem
ocrat who iias not conscience to guide
him." He stated that the principles of
the constitution are: First, that the Gov
ernment is non-sectarian; second, that
the Government is absolutely dependent
on religion to carry out the wishes of its
found rs. And this is one thing that the
present generation will have to study.
"Our forefathers saw very clearly that
the constitution should be non-sectarian,
yet from the lirst day the Government
began its career it has been dependent
upon religion. There is a tendency to-day
in every civiiized country to get along
without religion. The man who believes
in its possibility is cutting his own throat.
The man who undermines the principles
of our Government I say is a traitor.
"What is the palladium of our liberties?
Some say the baitot, others the judiciary.
There is no palladium at all. The ballot
must be honest or it is no protection, the
judiciary if corrupt is no palladium.
They sell your liberty, and what redress
have you? None. The palladium is
1 honesty, conscience, and that comes irom
God. Washington admitted that his
Government would s;o far nothing if there
were not religion underlying it. When
Washington formed this Government the
same trouble existed a? now, only it was
moie keenly marked. Rjiigiou was more
dogmatic than now."
With regard to education Bishop Mont
gomery said that he believed in a non
sectarian system. "I believe," said he,
"that every child in this country has a
right to be educated in the faith of his
fathers and that if tbe father has no
fail h his child has a right to be brought
up an infidel. I don't say it is right, but
it is their rights. Tho Government must
see the child is educated. If the father
and mother don't educate the child the
Government should make them do it, and
if they are unable, it should come in and
educate the child."
The Bishop declared for a non-sectarian
system of schools, but held that the
Government should not pay 1 cent for the
religious instruction of any body. The
only way to get the religion Washington
speaKs of is to educate the children ac
cording to the religion of their fathers.
In conclusion he stated that the Catholic
church is keeping up the spirit of the con
stitution to the very letter, and in doing
so it is pleading for the rights of all-
Protestant, Catholic, Jew and infidel.

days: those underneath it. if any. the amount of
rain tail, of melted snow in inches and huudredths.
â¢ (luring, the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
â ' lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hUh" means hlsh barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
. â¢ refers 10 low pressure, and is usually preceded
â  and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" si: ally first appear on the Washington
"coas;. When the pressure is high in the interior
and- tow tiioug the coast, and the isobars extend
. north and .sou; along the coast, rain is probable;
' but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coas 1 . warmer
weather may-be expected in summer and colder
-. weather in winter.' The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, I li.. Oct. 28.â Business in wheat
was comparatively narrow to-day, much of the
energy which has been an attribute of the trading
tor more than a month having disappeared and
the market setting into something of a rut. Trices
early recovered several fractions from yesterday,
an advance of %d at Liverpool affording strength,
lie near approach of c ection has â¢ a tendency to
curtail speculative transactions. Recelp s In the
Northwest again heavy at' 12U8 cars against
965 last week and 1228 a year ago. â¢ Chicago had
207 cars and inspected out 37.537 bushels. Cloi
ing Continents cables were ail lower. Export
j clearances were light at 168,154 bushels. < In the
liii hour trading stowed more animation than at
any previous period of the session, easy money
< rates having the effect of causing the bulls to ex
j hibit more courage. Prices at ihls time reached
the â¢â calls," where they met with free selling. De
cember wheat opene d from C9@-59iyiic, advanced
to7l3>ic, closing at 70%@71c, 2y B @2 Vic higher
than yfsterdav. Ksllmatxi receipts for to-mor
row 146 car- No. 2 red spot wn eat ranged noml
-1 natty irom 70c to 72 3 .ic, and closed a. abou;7l%
@7^%c.
I C. iiN â Was monotonously dull and low. Abso
\ lutely no Interest centered in th) trade, and the
tone was without guide other than that conveyed
by the neighboring wheat market. Tne specula
tive indifference noted early in the leading market
was also prevalent in corn. Liverpool cables were
y*A higher. Exports were fair a: 137,274 bushels.
Ma" corn opened from â¢iT'/^c to 28c, advanced to
2e3/ 8 Closing at â¢ jiÃV4(a2Bs/sC â %c hlcher than
1 yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 500
car j.
1 UATSâ Little attraction to traders was afforded
I br oats. The market was even qui-uer than
I either of the o h?rs and the tone was uerived from
j them. Receipts were 3-5 cars, and '/000 bushels
were taken from store. .May oats closed i/gc:o
Vie higher than yeiterday. Estimated receipts
for to-morrow 305 cars.
FLaXâ Easy. Ca-ih. 6?@59%c: December, 72

PROVISIONSâ A slow and wea^ hog market
had its natural effect on product. Holders were
discouraged and sold ihplr property. The pros
! peel of a restricted speculative demand during the
1 balance of the week was not. calculated to produce
I a bullish feeling. The very strong tone of whÂ°at
i revived the drooping feeling of product toward
the close. January pork closed 2%0 lower and
January lard and ribs each uiicbanKt-U. . '
BUTi ER-The demand for butter was limited.
Offerings were moderate and. an easy feeling pre

University, which would bring the total up to
$40,000,000. The sum paid teachers was only
some tiling over $5,000,000, or.' an average 01
$047 each per annum, or $53 94 per month.
As teachers have to live twelve months in tne
year it is only right to consider the pay in
twelve months' installments.- ,""a.,mrr
In San Francisco the average pay Is $iui'
per year or $84 17 per -month, which greatly
reduces the average pay of the average
teacher. If we take the average rural teacher
we will find it to be about $436 a year or *3(> a
month. Much has been said about the high
prices paid teachers, but it is false-, aud no set
of trustees should think of reducing the wages
of those who give tlici r.ves to this work. â¢ â  . â

Too Small.
Oakland Office San Fbakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 28. |
For ten years past the City Prison has
been condemned as unfit for habitation
even by tne permanent drunks and the
Fish gang. Many complaints have beon
The Novel Complaint Made to Chief Lloyd by the Artist Tramp.
[Drawn from the original.]
made by the Chiefs of Police and Boards
of Health, but it has been reserved for
Chief Lloyd to receive the first illustrated
complaint of the condition of the post
hole. It is so close to truth and bo unmis
takable that it will probably bear fruit,
aud successive generations of people who
are unable to be trusted with their liberty
may sing peans of praise to the memory
of the "artist tramp."
George Wiliam Harriss, the artist tramp,
is in the jail at present, and he unhesitat
ing affirms and will, he says, so state in
an affidavit that Oakland's prison is the
meanest place of its kind in the State.
Mr. Harriss has been in California nearly
four years. Abuut one-fourth of that time
he has been free and the remainder has
been spent in investigating the inner
workings of all the county jails and city
prisons in the State.
"I have had all kinds of companions in
prison," said Mr. Harriss to-day, "but I
have never been so overrun with attention
as in this modern Athens, as you call it
There are some thinps a gentleman ob
jects to. Being used as a platform during
sleeping hours for a circus and hippodrome
of overgrown rats is one of those objec
tionable features to which a true Bohemian
is exposed at times â and this is one of
those times.
"1 have been here before, but I believe
there is an element in the municipal
government favorable to boodle and op
posed to a tax levy that does not permit of
the prison cook being able to satisfy the
natural cravings of the rats.
"On account of the strict economy now
being practiced in the prison the rats have
to look out for themselves, and it is very
unpleasant for us.
"My stay here will not be long, but 1
thought that I would do something
toward helping others who may follow me.
I have depicted my first night's experience
here, and trust that the Chief will place it
before the Commissioners. Years ago I
was amused by reading 'The Pied Piper of
Hameliu,' but now it interests me."
When arrested for drunkenness Harriss
bad nothing in his pockets but a small
package of crayon* and pencils, which he
invariably carries with him. He was once
an artist in good standing on a New York
paper several years ago. One nisht there
was a spree in tue stuaio. Harriss knew
nothing about it till next morning, when
he made the discovery that everything
was wrecked. According to Harriss' de
scription of the wreck of ths studio an
ordinary cyclone lea\es things compara
tively unharmed. He took to the road,
and,, little by little, has developed into a
drunken tramp. He is well educated and
an interesting talker, being a great ob
server.
MANY TYPICAL FLOATS,
Alameda County Will Devote
Monday to the Cause of
Republicanism.
Special Trains Will Be Run From All
Points to the Great "Tom
Reed" Celebration.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,).
y.S Broadway, Oct. 28. t
Preparations for "Tom Reed day" are
being pushed with unabated vigor. A
large sounding-board is being erected over
the stand from which Thomas B. RÂ»ed
will speak, so that the thousands in the
grand stand at the racetrack will be able
to hear perfectly.
The advocates of woman suffrage have
secured permission for Rev. Anna Shaw
to speak after the guest of the day has fin
ished. It has not yet been decided who
shall preside over the great meeting Mon
day afternoon, but it is probable that a ,
leading business man will be chosen in
preference to a politician.
The procession will have many striking
feature-. The Remillard Company will
turn out ten decorated teams and a large
number of men.
George W. McNear will have a "wheat
float," which will carry a transparency
asking "Why didn't silver go up also?"
The Oakland Iron Works will have
some floats, showing men at work at the
forge, and four anvils.
F. M. Smith will furnish a borax com
pany fluat.
The California Cotton-mills will make a
display which will speak for sound money
and protection.
A very elaborate float is being arranged
by the Woman's. Republican Ciub. There
will be young ladies representing forty
five States of tbe Union.
The Arnv- and Navy League, which will
turn out 500 men, wiil have three floats.
A. A. Moore will have in line a lour-in
hand team, and with him wiil ride Messrs.
Nusbaumer, Reed, Remillard and other
personal friends.
The following appeal to business men
regarding floats was issued to-day:
To the Merchants and Business Men of Oakland:â
Desirous oi ni king the Kcpub ic-in parade

Political Economy and Financial
Questions Discussed at
Length
GEN. HABRISON DENOUNCED.
The Ex-President's Rec nt Article in
the Forum M s zm Vio.ently
Critkif d.
Judge W. P. Lawlor, chairman of the
California Silver Campaign Committee,
called the silver mass-meeting to order at
Metropolitan Temple last night. He in
troduced A. B. Morgan, a student from
Stanford University, as chairman of the
evening.
Mr. Morgan disclaimed any credit for
himself for what he was about to say. He
explained thai he was in a great degree
reflecting the opinions of Professors Ross
and Powers of Stanford University, who
have devoted a great deal of attention to
the questions of finance and taxation.
Resenting the accusation that support
ers of Bryan are anarcnists, Mr. Morgan
said that this charge is generally founded
on the plank in the Chicago platform
which criticizes the Supreme Court for
overturning the income tax. He ex
plained that all the Democrats want is to
have another Congress pass another in
come tax so that tne Supreme Court will
be compelled to act on the question again,
in the hope that by that time tbe court
will be changed and that the law will be
upheld. Tnis would not be a new thing.
greenbacks were first taken before
the United States Supreme Court they
were declared to be not a legal tender, but
the Republ.cans managed to get the thing
changed around so that at last greenbacks
were decided to be legal tender.
Ex-President Harrison denounced that
plank oi the Chicago platform, saying
that the Supreme Court was never criti
cized before. He forgot the greenback
cases and the Dred Scott case, which caused
so much criticism. Even in the recent in
come-tax case the prevailing opinion was
carried by only a majority of one. Jus
tice Harlan in a dissenting opinion de
clared that the decision of the majority
was a pubiic calamity, and criticized the
other members in caustic style. Yet he
has not been called an anarchist for eay
ing much Â«nore than the Democratic plat
form said.
Repudiation, Mr. Morgan insisted,
would not follow the remonetization of
silver, but he thinks that tbe keeping of
the gold standard, which is the Republi
can plan, would inevitably lead to repu
diation, since the rise in tbe value of gold
of itself increases our debt $500,000,000 a
year. At this rate it will be a physical
impossibility to pay the debt, and repu
diation muÃt ineviabie follow.
Ex-President Harrison's recent article
in the Forum, wherein he argue 3 on the
financial question, was denounced by Mr.
Morgan as "dastardly false."
Walter P. Stradley, when introduced,
announced that be had jnst returned from
the sou hern part of the State and that he
felt sure a great wave of Bryan majorities
would come up to T hachapi to meet the
deep stream of Bryan majorities that
would sweep from the northern part of
the State, and he warned his Republican
friends that it would be useless for them
to stem this majestic current with a Reed.
Quoting irom the words of Abraham
Lincoln wherein be said he foresaw dan
ger to the Republic on account of the
growing power of wealth, Mr. Stradley
said that this brought him to the thought
that the present campaign has a deeper
significance than the settlement of ques
tions ot taxation or finance. He believed
that the paramount issue of the campaign
is the perpetuity of popular Government
in the United States, and that this de
pends ou the success of the people in
placing the man of their choice in tbe
Presidential chair.
"We have lost a lot of Democrats in this
campaign," said Mr. Stradley, "and we
have gained some good men in their
places."
Monopoly of money, Mr. Stradley de
clared, is a great menace to the Nation,
and because the Democrats seek to break
this monopoly they are called revolution
ists. He for one admitted that he was iv
favor of a peaceful revolution to be
wrought out by the ballot-box.
President Cleveland, in trying to main
tain a gold reserve of $100,000,000, has
plunged the country into $262,000,000 addi
tional debt. But the gold bugs cry out
that our gold is constantly leaving us and
forget that we actually owe abroad about
$5,000,000,000.
The amount of gold actually in existence
is not more than $4,000,000,000. Of
course gold is going from us and will con
tinuetogo from us until our debts are
paid, but on a bimetallic plan we will have
something to fall back on â namely, silver.
Remonetization of silver would actually
benefit the silver mines of the West, Mr.
Stradley said, and he was ulad of it, for he
believed that the prosperity of the miners
would brinu' good times to everybody.
He took the position that if the United
States should rehabilitate silver it would
compel England to do the same in order
to keep us from cutting into its trade in
Indin. China, Japan, Mexico and South
American countries. After that other
nations would join, and we would have
international bimetallism, but interna
tional bimetallism by voluntary consent
of nations he declared to be an irridescent
dream.
Mr. Stradley said he believed that the
voice of God had dictated the writing of
the Chicago platform and had called out
for the Presidential nomination "that
matchless orator, that second Lincoln,
that sterling tribune of the people, Wil
liam Jennings Bryan."

DARING BURGLAR'S WORK

Charles Mitchell's Antics Result in a
Suit for Divorce and Im
prisonment
ALAMEDA, Cal.. Oct. 28.â P. W. Wal
lace and his wife of 2149 Railroad avenue
had an experience at an early hour this
morning with a bold and persistent
burglar, who made several ineffectual
attempts to enter their residence. The
first attempt was made at 1:30 o'clock,
when they were both awakened by some
one trying to saw the lock out of the back
door.
Mr. Wallace arose and as he entered the
kitchen he heard the intruder hurrying
away. A little later he heard some one
at the front door. Both arose thiÃ time,
and Wallace fired his revolver and Mrs.
Wallace blew her police whistle. An
officer responded, but the intruder had
made himself scarce. About an hour
afterward a stone was thrown violently
against the house. This again brought
into play the whistle and revolver and
policeman, but nothing came of it.
Just before the officer went off duty at
4 o'clock ne was again called, as another
attempt had been made to enter the rear
door of the house, but the excitement
within had reached such a pitch that both
Mr. and Mrs. Wallace had remained up
and were ready to protect themselves.
Mr. Wallace is a bookkeeper in San Fran
cisco, and is at a loss to understand the
motive of the persistent intruder.
He >>aile a Nice Mess.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 28.â Mrs. Mary
Mitchell of 1711 Arbor street, wife of
Charles A. Mitchell, who is serving a six
months' term in the San Francisco jail,
to-day filed a suit for a divorce. The com
plaint sets forth that they were married
May 4, 1888, in San Francisco, and a
seven-year-old daughter is the result of
the union.
The plaintiff alleges that she has been
treated in a cruel and inhuman manner
since 1893; that her husband often called
her the vilest names and beat and kicKed
her.
On one occasion she charges that he held
an ax over heroead, threatening to "brain
her" when she interfered when he was
beating their daughter for losing a glove.
The last charge is in the following lan
guage:
On August 26, 1896, defendant went to his
home in Alameda and destroyed all the pro
visions in the pantry; smashed the plaintiff's
sewing-machine, rendering it unfit for use;
destroyed three barrels of flour by emptying
one half of it into a box into which he then
threw blackberry preserves, pickled butter
aud other articles of food, making a sickening
mess. He then poured water into the other
half.
Mr. Mitchell then went to San Francisco and
started in to continue his war on everything
in sight. He threw a revolver through the
window of the office of the Chief of Police for
which he is now serving a sentence.

TAYLOR LEADS FOR
THE MAYORALTY
TMinond Forging Ahead of
.â¢ Fhelah for the Second
';â¢:â¢; . Place.
Universal : Popularity of the
..'. Regular Republican
;â  '""- 'â¢'â¢ Nominee.
XAXTMEISTER IS VÂ£_Y QUIET.
Hi's..Ctances Are Seldom Mentioned in
, Political Circlesâ O/bonnell a
â¢ " â¢' Back Number.
In municipal affairs the greatest interest
ift.inanifes.ted in the fight for the Jfayor
alty. .' .
; .It is conceded by the best informed men
of all. .parties that Colonel C. L. Taylor,
the" â¢'regul.ar Republican nominee, is far
#head of his opponents in the fierht for
that horuorable position, and that the best
ajiy d'ther nonrnee can hope for is to
securje second place in the race.
â  The friends of the various candidates,
â¢ however: are not conceding away the
enanee.3 of their favorites, and aside from
Coldriel Taylor, whose canvass is going
BteÂ«di.ly forward with a strength that
j-e?nrs:to ' be absolutely irresistible, the
others are oscillating forth and back in the
l>ublijc; estimation and in the scale of
chances for success.
. For instance, it may be v regarded as in
dis.pqtable that ten days v or even a week
a.go .Jajnes D. Phelan, nominee of the
Junta Democracy, was Jar ahead of all
the, nominees except Colonel Taylor.
.Yesterday tbe situation was changed, for
Joseph. L Dimond, who was nominated by
-the Kuckley Democratic Convention, had
'forged to second place. Mr. Dimond has
headquarters in the Parrott building and
his banner stretched across the street from
the Baldwin Hotel hears this inscription:
:'â¢.'. . JOSEPH I. DIMOXD
â¢;' â¢ â¢â¢â  . For Mayor.
â¢ â¢ " I%r the People. Against the Charter. :
â¢This sentiment appears to have filled
the Democratic heart with enthusiasm,' for
Mr;-I)imond'a headquarters are crowded
â¢with earnest workers who are flocking
from all parts of the City to pledge him
ttieir'support. Every one of these visitors
counts, for there is not one who is without
influence Id his own neighborhood.
On the other hand, Mr. Phelan's head
quarters in tbe Flood building appear al
most deserted, except lor the clerks and
other attaches who have been employed by
â¢Mn-Phelan'sliterary bureau toaddressand
mail the primed matter that so clearly
.sets forth the importance of adopting the
new. charter and electing Mr. Phelan as
Mayor.
Among Democrats the idea has become
deeply impressed that Mr. Phelan's can
didacy is closely identified with the advo
cacy-of the new charter, and as the newi
charter is not popuiar with a great many
Democrats Mr. Phelan's interests are sul
fenn^ in consequence.
Whatever other causes may be at work
tne friends of Mr. Dimond are growing
more confident &ay by day. T. J. Glynn
yesterday 6aid:
We have just received flattering new* from
the-waier uont and the Potrero concerning
Mr. Dimonci's growth in popularity. Wherever
he goes and voters get acquainted wiih him
thpy recognize him instantly as a man of the
.people and without hesitation decide to give
him their support.
Many clerks in ihe big dry goods stores were
voting" for Phelan last week. Now they are
for Dimond. It is hard fo tell what baa made
this chauge, but we know it has come.
A number of prominent liquor merchants
haw volunteered their support for Mr. Di
mond. They will not formally indorse any
candidate ior Mayor, but I think the ma
jority of them will be for Dimond on election
day.
Then there are the Democratic voters among
the iron foundries. Last week it was conceded
that many ot them preferred Phelan. At last
they have realized that Dimond lias a better
chance of being elected and they have de
cided to vote for the stronger mun, as they
don't want to throw their vote away.
Mr. Dimond, when asked fora personal
opinion of the outlook, declined to say all
that he thought about the situation, but
from his manner it was to be inferred that
he accepted the estimates of his adnerents
as trustworthy if not incontrovertible.
-â Charles Laumeister, the Kelly-Mahoney
nominee for Mayor, designated on the
official baliot as Citizens' Republican, .is
just about where he was when his cam
paign was opened. Very little is heard of
him in the various political centers. His
personal friends will vote for him as usual,
but ontside of that he will not cut any
flgnre in tbe result.
Dr. C. C. O'Donnell, the persistent inde
pendent nominee for Mayor, Coroner or
ajivthing e-lse, appears to have lost his
crip, and it is doubtful whether he will
come In ahead of or behind Oliver Everett,
tbe Socialist Labor candidate.'-
In conclusion, it may be noted that the
support of Colonel C. L. TayJor for the
Mayoralty does not come from any par
ticular class of citizens or any section of
the City. The sentiment in his layor per
vades ttie entire community, and is mani
fested in various ways throughout the
municipality. Whether you go into
stores, factories, shops, counting-houses
or banking establishments you are sure to
find a goodly number of voters who are
"'earnest in their advocacy of Colonel Tay
lor's candidacy. That is the kind of a
votb that counts on election day. It can
not be overcome by bonfires, marchiug
clubs and noisy orations from all the out*
of-tbe-way platforms of the City.

MONEY EASILY EARNED.
George Crocker Stuyed Sober Five
Years for 5500,000.
George Crocker has reaped his reward.
Having stayed sober five years at $100,000
a year he has been awarded the half mil
lion dollars promised him by his father
should he successfully accomplish that
task. Judge Daingerfield Tuesday de
cided that Mr. Croc&er had fulfilled all
the obligations imposed on him and or
dered Charles F. Crocker and William U.
Crocker, trustees of tne fund, to turn it
over to the beneficiary.
The history of the case Is peculiar.
Charles Crocker, father of George, Charles
F. and William H. Crocker, in making
his will failed to bequeath a portion of his
property to his son George, who was given
to overindulgence in intoxicants. In
stead, he placed 490 bonds of the Southern
I'ac.fic Company in the hands of the other
two sons in trust for George, with the pro
viso that if within fifteen years after the
death of the founder of the fund George
Crocker should stay sober lor rive consec
utive years the principal should be turned
over to Mm.
If, however, he failed to abstain from
overindulgence the bonds were to be dis
tributed among certain grandchildren of
Charles Crocker.
September 23 last George Crocker ap
plied ior the bonds, alleging he had beÂ«n
j sober for five years from September 22,
.1891. His brother, however, did not enre
Ito take the responsibility of deciding
whether or not this was so and therefore
brought suit asking the Superior Court to
determine the matter.
Judge Daingerfieid in his findings, de
clares that George CrocKer has not only
not been intoxicated during his period of
probation, but that he totally abstained
from the use of nil spirituous wines and
malt liquors during that period.
SUPERVISION OF ROADS,
Railway Commissioners Dis
cuss Some Proposed
Laws.
Would Like to Correct Abases for
tbe Safety of tbe
Public.
Owing to the absence of Mr. Clarke the
Railroad Commissioners did not hold
their usual monthly session yesterday.
Commissioners La Rue and Stanton were
present.
The object of the meeting was to take
action in the case of the delay on the \
Southern Pacific Company's part in send
ing in its annual report to the commis
sion. When the meeting was called the
Commissioners thought that the railroad
company would not make a report, but on
I the contrary treat it with contempt. Yes
terday, however, when Messrs. La Rue
and Stanton met they found the report
upon the table, and for that reason they
concluded to hold no meeting.
In an informal way the two Commission
ers discussed proposed suggestions to the
State Legislature regarding railway laws.
They were in favor of extending the pow
ers and jurisdiction of the commission so
as to include a general supervision of rail
way affairs.
The proposition is to present a law to
the Legislature similar to tnat enforced in
Kansas, compelling all railways to make
thpir annual reports on a certain day or to
suffer a penalty of % 100 for each day be-
I yond the specified date until the report is
submitted.
Another law was given serious consid
eration, and that is a provision for giving
the board power to compel railway com
panies in California to make improve
ments alone the different roads wherever
such alterations aie thought necessary.
This would include piacing of switches at
points that might be deemed proper for
them, and In a general way to make im
provements where the road might be in a
dangerous condition, and, conseauentlv, a
menace to the public traveling "over the
line. Another section was discussed with'
regard to gates at all railway crossings for
protection ot the public. This was re
garded us Â«n important measure, and re
caived favorable consideration.
The State Board of Railroad Commis
sioners wants general supervision of all
railways in California, and this meeting
was only the beginning of a movement
looking toward that end. The boaru sill
meet next week to arrange its report to
the Governor, in which it was delayed by |
the Southern Pacific's failure to send in a I
report for the past year. The suggestions
about proposed laws will be mentioned to
tbe Governor.
At present the commission has control
over rates only, and even that is doubtful,
so an effort will be made to find its exact
status; and also to pet laws passed ex
tending the commission's powers and
supervision.

Straggle in Contra Costa County Over
a Privilege Which Two
Parties Wanted.
A return to the writ of mandate issned
by the Supreme Court October 8 in the
matter of Robert G. Dean against the
Board of Supervisors of Contra Costa
County has been made by M. B. Ivory,
chairman of the board, and F. L. Glass,
County Clerk. Tbe return recites the pro
ceedings connected with the granting of a
wharf franchise to Seward B. McNear.
McNear petitioned the Supervisors of
Contra Costa County for authority to con
struct a wharf near the wharf franchise
granted to the California Wharf Com
pany, the application being made last
July. The notice was published and
posted, according to the affidavits of
County Clerk Gtass and Alfred Dalton of
the Contra Costa News. 11. G. Dean also
petitioned for authority to construct a
wharf and named substantially the same
location as McNear. His petition was
filed July 6, 1896. but was prepared before
a noUry, William S. Wells, three days
earlier. The notice of Dean's petition
was duly published, according to the same
denonents.
Dean appeared by counsel before the
Contra Costa Board of Supervisors July 6,
and so did McNear by counsel. From
then on the Supervisors considered the
rival petitions until October 6, at 10 A. M.,
when it was voted, 3 to 2, 10 stive the
franchise to McNear, and Dean's petition
was denied. Supervisors Rumrill, Hemme
and Schneider voted in favor of giving
the franchise to McNear and Supervisors
Majors and Ivory voted in the negative.
Then Dean brought the matter into the
Supreme Court und tbe fight is still on.

..A. Decidedly.' Spicy Meeting of the
â¢ . . Board" of Educationâ Director
â¢. ;â¢..:' .â¢ :â¢ Btaraock Is Seated.
â¢ 'Bup'eriniendent Babcock, by dint of per
severance, managed to make a very inter
estiiig-Bessidn\o-f the Board of. Education j
last even iric out of wbat otherwise would
â¢'hav^ been But;. a dull" affair. He took an
't)tliet-turi\,ort\Vo ontof his old antipathy, .
e-i-PEpsident Hyde, then he made another t
.but -unsuccessful effort to oust Director
'jlurdbck-frtKca his seat, that K entleman
having returned to it in spite of the Su
perintendent's declaration that he was no
â¢Jon'ger-a member. .Thereafter the meet
ing adjourned; he had the temerity to|uing
â¢down a gauntlet to President Scott himself,
declaring,.that he (Scott) might bulldoze
tlie- board, btit. he could not bulldoze him
(B-aticook) ngr so much as one side of him.
Altogether the Superintendent was ont
â¢ for large anS deep vessels full of red, red
.blood last evening.
â¢".* Thftenter-tainment began almost imme-
; diately -after the reading of the minutes.
OLt. Uabcock rose with a copy of the Wave |
â¢in his hand, and called attention to an ar
ticte-headed- "Superintendent of School?,"
â¢which reflected rather severely u-pon him.
[ ."rhis board- is criticized with regard to
.the expense of running the School I?epart
,nierit," ne said. ."The article is evidently
inspired by a man who never does any
thing in'the'iigbt. He reiterates the false
hoods tKat he uttered before the Grand
. Jury something over a year ago, reiterat
. ing them o'l| the assumption that decent
â â¢mÂ«ii- have forgotten. He never comes out
infeothe lrghrjto say these things that he
knows, to be falsehoods. This same man
has said that he could run the schools of
this City and County on $1,000,000 a year
and ..put $75,000 in his pocket. As to the
'truth of the-.latter statement I have no
doubt. If a'n^ man could do so he could.
'. "l.will read in reference to this subject
a'.cbmmunication to the Examiner, writ
ten by this '.man June 17, 1893, when he
was a member of -the Board of Education."
â /. Mr. Babc"ock- read the communication
in which, ov,er his own signature, Mr.
â¢Hyde took strong exception to the pro:
.posal then under consideration by the
â¢â  finance Committee of cutting down the
demand of tne-departmenfto $1,075,000,
and declaring .that the schools could not
"be r.un on sum, and that the result
"would be. that t lie schools would have to
be-ctosed for. a month. "This," said Mr.
â¢ Babcock, "is answer to the other statement
.by tfee same man. This publication," he
said, "has. been circulated among the
schools with the evident purpose of aiding
certain candidates," and this was his ex
cuse for bringing the matter before the
board.
' No action was taken.
â¢ A few minutes later, at the first call for
a vote upo.n the routine business of the I
board,' Mr. Babcock called attention to j
. the fact that "a name is being called here \
of a man who has resigneu from this
board. His vote, upon any matter here ia j
unlawful; he i 3 not a member of the
board." >
Chairman Scott said briefly that he un
derstood this, question would be raised,
and, not confident of his own ability to
â¢lecide it, he had secured a legal opinion,
and would now decide that Mr. Murdock,
having withdrawn his resignation, was
still a mcmlier of the board.
Mr. Babcctck took exception. He started
in to say whai the "law said," when the
â¢chairman interrupted him, saying that
the matter had been decided. He could
move an appeal from the chair if he
wislted.
"But this is not a matter that can be de
cided by the chair."
"You can appeal if you wish â it is al
ready decided."
"The vote of this ex-member would be
recorded in this matter in such event, and
it would be unlawful. I therefore say that
the decision of the chair won't go."
"That is your individual opinion. There
are other officials of the board who differ
with you. The clerk will continue to
read."
Mr. Babcock sat down. .
Under the head of new business Mr.
Murdock introduced a resolution instruct
ing all school principals to not per
mit the circulation of any literature in th-s
schools relating to any candidate. Di- j
rector Carew moved that it be referred to
the Committee on Eules and this was
done. This action kills the r< solution for
this campaign.
Mr. Babcock was nu affected by
Director Murdock : s conciliatory resolu
tion. A few minutes latter he rose, and
referring to the "late member," said that
he had resigned and the board, in view of
the fact that the matter had been referred
to the City and County Attorney, had
without dissent decided to allow it to stand
notwithstanding the withdrawal of the
resignation..
Mr. Muropck, he said, had#nromised to
'keep away from the meetings of the board
until it was decided. He offered this as I
. pome history as the matter which had oc- 1
curred during the chairman's absence.
Mr. Murdock rose to answer this state
ment, but the chairman declared there
was. nothing before the house.
As Chairman Scott came down from his
seat at the adjournment a few minutes
later be' said good naturedly as he passed
the Superintendent: 'You are wrong,
Babcock, in this matter; you are wrong."
"I am not wrong and you will see that

reply.
"Oh, no," said Scott, "you are all
wrong."
"I am not, though," retorted Babcock,
hotly. "You can bulldoze this board,
maybe, but you can't bulldoze one side of
me."
"I am not trying to bulldoze you, but I
would have you understand that I don't
car* for you one way or another," said
Scott, also eetting into a hish key.
""Pshaw!" said Balcock. "I saw men
before you were born." .
"Oh ! Well you may see men after I
am dead. 1 have seen men, too, some of
them almost as good as you,- but rot

the incident passed without bloodshed.
FOR THE WAIFS.
Mrs. John Pettee Will Raise Funds
for an Emergency Hos
pital.
On Thursday evening, November 5, Mrs.
John Pettee, wife of the well-known ex
pert accountant, will hold an open house
at her residence, 2505 Leavenworth street,
to raise funds for a Children's Emergency
Hospital.
Mrs. Pettee's charitable plan is tbuÂ« in
dorsed by the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children:
Mrs. John PHtce, 5505 Lm-'enworth street, Cityâ
Dear Madam: Referring to our conversation
on Saturday last concerning your project for a
Children's Emergency Hospital, I beg to state
that in my opinion such an institution is an
actual necessity in this City, aud I believe
when the charitable people of San Francisco
realize the objects and scope of your work that
you will receive the assistance you so well
merit.
It lias been a source of great anxiety to the
officers ol this society to know at times where
to place a child suffering from disease who is
taken at night from dissolute or immoral par
ents. It is frequently very difficult to find
places for healthy children who nre taken ui>
der such circumstances, and in the case of a
sick or diseased child nlmost impossible.
As I understand it, your object is to provide
a place where just sucn children can be takan
at a moment's notice, receive the necessary
medical care and attention, and be kept until
other arrangements can be made for their well
beine.
1 am sure the little ones are to be congratu
lated on having a lady of your social standing
and great energy at the heaa of this new pro
ject for their relief and comfort.
The objec: is a nobie one. and I sincerely
wish you tne fullest measure of success.
With great respect I am, madam, yours truly,
Charles P. Welch.
Admission to the reception this day
week will be 50 cents, which will give
guests the entree to an elaborate vocal and
instrumental entertainment, witu choice
refreshments.
WHY THEY WANT McKINLEY
Attorney Findlsy Brown on the Posi

was less than 75,000 for Harrison, bnt it
will be 200,000 and possibly much more for
McKinley. He says Philadelphia alone
will give 100. 000 majority for him. Speak
ing of Mr. Bryan, Mr. Brown said that the
Pennsylvanians could not understand on
any reasonable grounds why they should
vote for him.
"What has he done," said Mr. Brown,
"that he should expect the people to vote
for him for the highest office in the gift of
the Nation? He has no record of long
and conscientious service. He is not a
conservative man. On the contrary, he is
one whom conservative men throughout
the country have every reason to believe
will not prove the right man for the Pres
idency.
"It is because of this and of the Chicago
platform, on which he stands, that tne
people of Pennsylvania are not for him.
They want a man like Mr. McKinley, of
ripe experience, who is conservative and
who will carefully look alter the interests
of the country."
Mr. Brown will be in the City and
vicinity for a week or two.

TOOK AN OATH
AND KEPT IT
Suicide in One of the Rooms
of the Cliff
House.
Albert Capelle's Desperafe Means
of Reforming Him
self.
A STRUGGLE FOE SOBRIETY'
The Dead Man Had Been a Hard
Drinker end Could Not
Stop.
"I give you my word, so help me God,
this is the last drink I will ever take on
earth!"
Tliese words were uttered last evening
at 9:^o in a private room at the Cliff House
by Albert H. Capelle to his friend and
companion, C. Ed Bendixen.
This oath so solemnly spoken was
gladly heard by Bendixen, who had been
tryine to induce his friend to break away
from monttis of excessive indulgence In
intoxicating liquors.
CapeJle kept his oath, for as he spoke
he drained the glass, which he held in his
left hand. He then drew a revolver from
his pocket aud sent a bullet plowing
through his temples.
In twenty-five minutes he was dead.
The young man is the brother of Robert
J. Capelle, general agent of the North
German Lloyd Steamship Company, whose
office is at 118 Montgomery street. He
had been acting as bookkeeper of the firm
and while his brother Robert was absent
on a visit to their old home in Hamburg,
Germany, he had the management of tho
ollice.
Robert returned a few days ago and
found that the deceased had spent most
of the time away from the office and
drinking heavily.
His companion last night was C. Ed
Bendixen, an insurance agent living at 20
O'FarreJl street.
Bendixen is also a German and has
been intimately acquainted with the
Capelles for a long time.
He stated last night at the scene of the
tragedy that Capelle had often threatened
to do 'himself some injury when ha was
moody and miserable from his overin
dulgence in liquor and that he watched
Capelie closely when he was in this con
dition.
Yesterday afternoon about 3 o'clock
they went to the Cliff House, and, after
drinking together several times at the
bar, went upstairs to a private room,
where they ordered a bottle of wine and
some cigars.
Capelle was quite despondent and
wanted to throw himself over the balcony
into the sea. He was restrained by his
companion, and the two young men sat
in their apartment talking and drinking.
During the conversation Capelle wrote the
following on the back of one of his busi
ness cards:
Charlotta Mendieth Capelle, San Pedro,
Santa, Honduras.
This he gave to Bendixen, saying it was
the name of a little girl in Central
America who was his wife. This was
news io the other, who did not know that
his friend was married.
Bendixen began expostulating with
Capelle regarding his intemperance.
The young man kept striding around
the room and finally he picked up a glass
ot wine and took the oath that he would
never drink again on earth.
He was dead in less than half an hour
after.
The bullet entered the right temple and
came out on the left side of his head.
He was 33 years old and a native of
Hamburg, Germany.
Mr. Wilkins of the Cliff House was noti
fied of the suicide soon after the shot was
fired. Two physicians were summoned,
but Capelle wa* beyond all human aid.
The body was permitted to lie where it
fell, the revolver clasped in the dead man's
hand, until the arrival of the Coroner,
when it was removed to the Morgue.
A telegram was found on the body which
reads as follows:
October 23, 1896.
A. H. Capelle: Call for $500 on agency
Comptoir Rationale Escompte, Paris.
H human Capelle & Co.
There was also the picture of a very
pretty young woman.
FRAUD IS CHARGED.
Albert Samuels of Auburn Arrested on
Complaint of Murphy, Grant
& Co.
Albert Samuels, dry-goods merchant in
Auburn, Placer County, was arrested yes
terday on a warrant charging him with
obtaining goods and money by false pre
tenses. He was released on $2000 bonds,
accepted by Judge Daingerfielu.
Tne warrant was sworn to in Judge
Joachimsen'B court by Charles R. Havens,
accountant for Murphy. Grant <fe Co. It
is alleged that on June 6 Samuels bought
$500 worth of goods from the firm repre
senting that he had a surplus of $8300
and that his liabilities only amounted to
$1872.
A few days ago Samuels filed an affidavit
that he owed $17,000, of which $5000 w.ns
due to his wife. This last amount comes
within the period when he said he only
owed $1872.
A similar case was that of Sol Lazar, a
merchant in Grass Valley and Madera.
He was arrested some months ago on com
plaint of Murphy, Grant & Co. and two
other firms.
The case was assigned to Judge Camp
bell's court and it dragged along till Mon
day last when it was dismissed.
A meetii.g of the creditors of Samuels
and other wholesale merchants was held
In the Board of Trade rooms yesterday to
discuss the situation of affairs and see if
something could not be done to put a stop
to such business methods.

KILLED BY A
WEE BLUE FLY
Myron Mills, Stung by an
Insect, Dies of Blood-
Poisoning.
The Lad Suffared for a Few
Days, Then Completely
Collapsed.
BACILLI TO BE EXAMINED.
Attending Physicians Puzz'el at the
Peculiar Nature of the
Boy's Case.
A peculiar case of death from blood
poisoning, caused by the sting of a small
blue fly, is at present occupying the atten
tion and interest of the medical profes
sion of this City.
About three weeks ago Myron Mills, 14
years of-age, son of Mrs. E. Mills, a Contra
Costa County school teacher, was itung
by a small fly on the point of his chin.
He told his mother a few minutes after
the occurrence that he was suffering from
a burning sensation around the throat.
He also told her that it was caused by a
peculiar fly, very much like a house fly,
only larger and "of a blue color, stinging
him on the chin.
In a short time the pain subsided, and
nothing more was thought of the case un
til three days later, when the boy's chin
began to swell. A local physician was
summoned, but as he was unable to re
lieve the lad's suffering he was removed
to this city for treatment.
He was placed in charge of Drs. Marc
Levingston, Rosenstern and Nathan, and
as the case appeared to be a serious one
the patient was removed to the California
Surgical Hospital.
An operation was performed by the at
tending physicians, and it was found that
the jawbones had become diseased.
The flesh on the right side of the face
was also disintegrating and was tilled with
thousands of minute pits. The bones
were scraped and the wound dressed, which
apparently resulted in a cure. J
The left side of the face and the flesh
behind the ear finally began to show pigns
of rapid i metamorphosis. Everything
possible was done for the unfortunate suf
ferer, but lost Thursday he completely
collapsed aud died Saturday afternoon.
The physicians having the case under
their care were puzzled at the peculiar
action of the insect poison. The pitting
of the flesh and degeneration ot the bone is
rarely mÂ»t with in such cases, and a thor
ough study of the case will be made.
Pieces of the diseased flesh and bone were
taken by the physicians and a bacterio
logical exaTiination, to determine the na
ture of the bacilli which caused death,
will be made.
A colony of the dangerous eerms is now
in course "of incubation, and in about a
week the examination wiil have been com
pleted.
Another peculiar feature of the case is
the fact that after the first few days the
boy Buffered no pain.
Death was due to simple blood potaon
j ing, caused Dy the decay of fiÂ»h and bone.
Consequently tfie result of the bacilli ex
amination is being awaited by the physi
cians with interest.

To-Day'g Press Club Entertainment.
Promptly at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon the
curtain will rise at Morosco's Grand Opera
house on the entertainment of tbe San Fran
cisco Press Club. The programme is a long
one, und though of unusual merit throughout
the necessities of the case require that there
be no delay. It will be well, therefore, to get
there early. The entertainment will include
the best features from all the theaters as given
by leading talent, it will be an entertainment
rich and rare in character and which will be
long remembered, it is believed, with cleas
ure. Mr. Morosco is himself taking a "great
interest in the entertainment. He placed his
opera-house at the disposal of the club.

PARADERS AND
CAR MEN CLASH
Marching Democrats Are
Thrown Into Dismay
by a Motorman.
Accidentally Ran His Train Into
the Line and Scattered
Its Symmetry.
IT ALMOST CAUSED A SIOT.
The Angry Crowd Pulled Off the
Trolley and Endeavored to Over
trpple the Car.
Marching Democrats on their way to
Metropolitan Temple, a streetcar and two
over-zealous employes of the Market
street -Railway Company clashed on
Kearny street, near Bush, at 8 o'clock last
evening. Consternation and contention
then reigned for a while supreme.
The trouble was caused by an endeavor
on the part of a motorman and a conduc
tor to run their train, 1164, to its des
tination as speedily as possible. All went
well until the car reached the parading
Iroquois and uniformed clubs at Bush
street. The colnmn of marchine men was
directly on the car tracks. With clanging
bell tha raotorman pursued his way.
The ranks of the paraders were broken
in an instant, the band ceased to play and
the Ham beaux no longer flamed. Some
thin^ had to be done to again get the men
in line, and those who wanted to get in
line invented a way.
They swarmed aboard the car, and the
motorman and conductor, thinking their
time had come, fit d into the closed part
of the car and held the door with the
strength of desperation. The trolley was
jerked from the wire, and an excited
crowd endeavored to topp'e over the car.
It creaked and swayed and all but left
the track. Officer Webster witnsssed the
disturbance from a distance and hurrving^
to the scene calmed the angry crowd. "The
men again fell in line and marched off,
but the motorman and conductor were
content to let their car remain at a stand
still until the parade had disappeared from
view.
Young Mason Convicted.
Edward Mason ivas yesterday convicted In
the District Court of using the mails for
fraudulent purposes. In Slay last Mason
wrote to Mrs. Caroline Christie of Boston,
stating that her son, Everett Christie, had met
with serious injury. in a railroad accident and
the sum of $100 was needed for his comlort.
As the letter waÂ« signed "Edwnrd Mason,
Sheriff of Truckce," trie mother did not hesi
tate to send trie money. Some days later,
made bold by his former success. Mason wrote
to Miss Chrisiie requestiUK a similar amount.
That young lady, however, initde inquiries
which finally resulted in Masou's arre&t and
conviction. It seems that he never knew
young Christie personally, but in some man
ner, unknown at present, had ienrned the ad
dress of his parents and in v heartless way ex
torted money from them MBSon will proba
bly be sen tenced to-day, the limit for such a
crime being eighteen months and a fine of
$500.
