VOLUME LXXXI.-NO. 21.
LESS DANGER OF
WAR WITH SPAIN
Plenty of Precedents Are
Found Â«in Recognizing
the Cubans.
But Then Cameron's Resolution
Is a Long Way From
Passage.
Conservative Statesmen Say There
Will Ba No Serious Difficulty Be-
tweeo Cleveland and Congress.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec 20.â
Neither Senator Sherman, chairman of
M:e Foreign Relations Committee, nor
Anator Morgan of that committee be-
Vves that there is any danger of war with
Â£Â£>am as a result of the possible adoption
of the Cameron resolution. Both of them
were interviewed by The Call corre
spondent to-night. Senator Sherman
thinks the resolution is siniDly a recogni
tion of the "republic of Cuba," and as
such gives that country authority to send
representatives to the United States. Con
tinning he said :
'.'We recognized the independence of
Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and of other
South American republics while they were
sti:l struggling against Spain, and that
was not considered cause for war on the
part of that country.
"Spain recognized the independence of
the. Confederacy in 1861 before a single
battle bad been fought, if we except the
firing on Fort Sumter, and yet that was
not considered cause for war."
Senator Sherman said that in case the
President vetoed the resolution, it could
be passed over his i:ead.
Senator Morgan, in speaking of the
possibility of Spain securing the aid of
some other European power in war against
tbe United States, said:
"I do Dot think she could secure the as
sistance of any power aeainst us. You
must remember that Europe is an armed
camp. There are millions of men over
tbere under arms and for what? To watch
each otber. The moment any one of them
interfered she would find herself harassed
at home, but there is no reason why Spain
should become involved in war with us
simply because we recognize the inde
pendence of the Cubans. You nrobably
noticed that tbe resolution was amended
to read 'The Republic of Cuba,' but the
second section leaves a way out for Spain,
becauee it says that the United States will
use its friendly offices to bring the war to
a conclusion.
"There will be no undue haste in press
ing the resolutions to a vote. When laid
â  fore the Senate it will be accompanied
by a most voluminous report, going over
the wnole matter of the recognition of
belligerency for the past century by this
and other Governments. We want to see
this information published and have it go
before the people before any action by tbe
Senate is taken. In fact. I would like to
Bee the report co before the Spanish peo- j
pie before we adopt it, so they may all
understand it.
â¢â¢I fully believe that Spain stands in
greater trouble to-day from internal dis
sensions than she does bom the rebellions
in Cuba and in the Philippines. Republi
canism is very strong in Spain, and any
act of the present Government that could
be used in bringing about its downfall
will be taken advantage of. Canovas
recognizes this, and he realizes that tbe
only way to maintain the national spirit
is to inflame the perpie against a common
eDemy."
The Cuban question and Secretary Ol
ney's statement of the executive position
may precipitate a debate in the Senate to
morrow that will set aside the regular
business assigned for the two days that
body will be in session before the holiday
recess. It is not improbable that some of
the more radical Cuban sympathizers will
start the discussion with the presentation
of Senator Cameron's resolntion shortly
after tbe morning hour.
Conservative Senators who have studied
the precedents are inclined to the opinion
that the talk about a serious difficulty be
tween the President and Congress has no
â ound foundation.
Cool heads will counsel moderation.
There is not the remotest probability of
Cameron's resolution recognizing the in
dependence of the republic of Cuba being
acted upon in the Benate before the holi
day recess. When the debate does begin
it is evident that Senators Morgan, Tsvis,
Chandler, Lodge and Mills will take a po
sition adverse to the Secretary of State,
and the discussion may be prolonged till
after the 4th of March.
It was agreed in the Committee on For
eign Relations that the report on the
Cameron resolution should be made to
morrow, and that the matter should not
be called up until after the holidays. This
agreement will be carried out.
OLNEY ACTED ADVISEDLI
Author it// I Upon Which He Intimated the
* - Function of the Executive. .
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec There
' is every reason to believe that Secretary
Olney's declaration that recognition is ex
clusively an executive function was not
made until after that cautious and thor
ough deliberation which characterized his
conduct of the negotiations with Lord
Salisbury over the Venezuelan' contro
versy and other important official matters
which have called for his decisions since
he entered President Cleveland's Cabinet
â¢ as Attorney-General nearly 'our years
aeo. It is well known in the highest of
ficial circles, especially in the Cabinet,
that questions of Presidential prerogative
, were forced upon him by his colleagues
among the executive's advisers at the
Jfoutset of this administration in connec
"mion with the perplexities that arose; in
The Hawaiian affair when the executive
was placed in direct antagonism with
Congress. The paramount mission of
Commissioner Blount to Honolulu ' was
understood to have been taken with the
Attorney-General's full indorsement, and
all the subsequent acts of tbe administra
tion with regard to the midocean republic
The San Francisco Call.
were said to have hart his approval, if, in
deed, they had not been inaugurated at
his suggestion.
In his official capacity Mr. Olney was
intimately associated with the President
in the steps which were taken to suppress
the great railway riots by the use of Fed
eral troops and throughout his occupancy
of the Department of Justice he was con
stantly called upon to declare executive
power under the constitution.
The sharp deruarkation of Congressional
and executive functions with respect to
purely international matters was pre
sented to him as the legal adviser of tbe
President upon the adoption of the Hoar
Turkish resolution, and at that time it
was understood that such instructions to
the President, whether in the form of con
current or joint resolutions, did not reauire
compliance. The President neither signed
nor di-approved the re-olutions, nor did
he transmit them to the Ottoman Porte.
The Cuban resolutions were similarly
ignored, though at the time of their adop
tion it was generally understood that Sec
retary Olney ad reached the conclusion
that their effect was conclusively ad
visory, however mandatory their language
might be.
It is pointed out by State Department
officials that Congress has never been con
firmed by the Supreme Court in its asser
tion of any powers not expressly given to
it by the constitution. In the event of the
recognition of either the belligerency or
independence of Cuba the first result, it is
held, would be the appearancb of an ac
credited Minister or other emissary of
that island. The contention is that under
the constitution the President is the sole
judge as to whether such emissary shall
be received. Precisely this emergency ha<
arisen in the past few weeks. The greater
republic o: Central America has come into
existence and its accredited Minister, Mr.
Ruduer.ey, has been in Washington a
fortnight. He has not been received by
the President nor has the American charge
at Managua been authorized formally to
recognze the new arrangement.
The President also took his own time in
recognizing the Provisional Government
of Hawaii and also the Dole Government.
Frequently prompt recognition of a foreign
Government has taken place without any
thought of possible approval or disap
proval of Congress, notably when Presi
dent Harrison acted upon the termination
of the Chilean revolution. The same wa
aiso the case upon the establishment of
tbe present republic of France and the
republic of Brazil. Another recent case
of exercise of the President's authority in
receiving and dealing with foreign Minis
ters occurred in the dismissal of Sir Sack
vilie West, the British Minister. While
this caused no disruption of oor relations
with England, it is held that it showed it
to be the President's power to act without
consulting Congress, and it was execu
tive action which might have led to war.
In this connection it is also pointed out
that while Congress can alone declare war.
it is cleariy within the power of the Presi
dent by his own action to bring about a
war, which, if declared by an opponent,
would create a condition be would be com
pelled to meet until Congresn could assem
ble and act.
NO DANGER OF A RUPTURE
Spain ;Aot in ~~d' J Hurry to Croat Sword.%
With tho United States.
MADRID, Spain, Dec. 20.â Senor Cano
vas del Castillo, Prime Minister',. has re
ceived the official text of President Cleve
land's message to the American Congress,
and will shortly make a declaration' on
that part of the document which refers to
the Cuban 1 question. Conferences have
been held, 'luring the past few days be
tween tie most prominent men in politi
cal life in Spain with the object of peeking
a solution of the problem which confronts
the Government ami which it is possible
might canst a war with the United States.
.It is conceded in political circles that
the situation is grave, but it is thought
that the willingness of Spain to grant re
forms in the Spanish West Indies should
tend to avert any display of aggressive
ness on the part of the United States. One
point is settled upon, and that is that no
reforms shall. be put into effect in Cuba
until the insurrection be suppressed, for it
is held that to offer reforms with the
Cubans still in arms would indicate weak
ness on the part of Spain and would also
be derogatory to Spanish honor.
Though indignation caused by receipt of
the news of tbe action of the Committee
on Foreign Relations of the American
Senate shows little significance, there has
not been many manifestations over its
representatives in Spain. That such mani
lestations were expected is shown by the
fact that police and gendarmes were de
tailed to guard the American legation
here and precautions were taken elsewhere
to protect the various consulates of the
United States should tbe excited people
attempt to make an attack or them.
Orders were sent to the Governors of sev
eral provinces to prohibit any anti-Amer
ican demonstrations, and from dispatches
received to-day from provincial capitals it
is known that the orders were faithfully
carried out.
Prominent politicians confirm the state
ments contained in yesterday's dispatches
to the United Associated Presses that it is
tbe intention of tbe Government, when
the opportune time arrives, to put into
effect in Cuba uolitical and economical re
forms which it is said will be wider in
their scope than those proposed by the
Cortes last year.
The death is denied to-day of Senor Don
Manuel Decuerra, Minister of the Colonies.
He was very popular, and it is said of him
that one time he hindered the sale of Cuba
to the United States.
The Epoca, the organ of Senor Cano
vas and tbe Ministerialists, in comment
ing on the situation, says that Spain
needs at the present moment much calm,
sound judgment on the part of the pub
lic to avoid greater difficulties than those
the Government is now facing. As lor.g
as prudence is compatible with national
honor, Spain has nothing to do save to
defend her rights if they are attacked. A
recognition of belligerency is nut a casus
belli unless such recognition is granted by
an interested nation. Formerly S| am
recognized the belligerency of the South
ern States of America, despite the protest
of the Federal Government, which did
not rogard the attitude of European gov
ernments in this matter as a casus belli.
If the act indicated by the Cameron
resolution shall be consummated, Spain
will protest, thereby greatly straining the
relations between ti.e Unite- States and
Spain, but the Spaniards must now forget
the attitude of thÂ« powers which, after
President Cleveland's declaration anent
tbe Anglo- Venezuelan dispute, abstained
from an intervsntion. Spain ought to
keep account of all these precedents.
Prime Minister Canovas holds that un
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 21, 1896.
SANTA GLAUSâ They are pretty good papers, but I shall waft for the Christmas "Call."
der the framing cf Senator Cameron's res
olution there will be no armed interven
tion on tbe part of the United States in
Cuban territory. Though the partisans of
the proposal may obtain the necessary
votes to override the veto which he be
lieves President Cleveland will interpose
and so make the resolution an obligatory
act of Congress, it would only affect a
recognition of the independence of Cuba
and lead to an offer of its gr od ofnees by
the United States to terminate the war.
With whatever officiousness the United
States may interpose, Spain will retain the
right tn accept or nject the offer of the
American good offices. if the United
States recognizes the independenae of
Cuba she will then have to recognize the
laws of neutrality. If she recognizes the
belligerency of the Cubans, Spain will
have the right to stop and visit American
vessels at sea.
Senor Canovas does not think that tbe
Cameron resolution need cause serious
perturbation. It will only make the rela
tions between Spain and the United States
more strained, but need not cause a rup
ture. He will never consent to foreign
interference in what is a question of Span
ish domestic politics. Spain will regulate
her acts 30 that nobody will be able to say
that she made war upon another power,
yet she will always repel aggression. The
tone of the newspapers generally is more
moderate to-day than it was yesterday.
They contain little to excite the populace.
MANY MEN COLENTERS
General Colby Would Bare Ao Trouble to
Raise an Army.
BEATRICE, Nebb., Dec. 20.â General L.
W. Colby, ex-Assistant United States At
torney-General, whose proposition to raise
an army of 10,000 men to fight for Cuba
was given publicity tn rough the United
Associated Presses, is receiving letters and
telegrams from all over the country in
dorsing his plan, urging him to continue
in his efforts and asking to be enrolled as
volunteers.
One of these is from Colonel Robert Mc-
Reynolds of Oklahoma who says: "1 see
by the dispatches what you say regarding
Cuba. I want you to count me in with
100 of the finest shots in this Territory. I
want to be with you â on your staff, ii pos
sible. I have been agitating the question
for a year and a half now, and am in
earnest in every word I say."
Colonel Me Reynolds served under Gen
eral Colby in the Sioux campaign at
Wounded Knee. Last winter he went to
Cuba and fought with the insurgents as a
private. He is the man who at Galveston
was threatened with arrest by Federal
officials Jor advertising for "one hundred
men well armed, of undoubted bravery, to
go on the Gulf of Mexico to shoot geese."
Tbe words "shoot geese" was merely a
blind as he subsequently admitted.
The prominence of General Colby and
his unquestioned sincerity has made of
the matter which was at first thought to
be but an idle threat a serious possibility.

JUDGE McKENKA
THE FAVORITE
Leads in the Race of the
Californians for a Place
in the Cabinet.
Major McKinley Would Be Glad
to Honor His Friend and
Former Associate.
Senator Perkins Says tbe Memorial
Urging Horace Davis* Appointment
Has Not Tet Gone to Canton.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 20.â The
Call correspondent learned to-night from
a reliable source that President-elect Me-
Kinley is considering the advisability of
appointing United States Circuit Judge
McKenna a member of bis Cabinet.
The rumor has been circulated in
Washington for several weeks among
the California colony, but only
within a few days has it been seri
ously considered. Several Californians
who have stopped off at Canton to see the
President-elect have reported him as say
ing that he would be glad to appoint some
Pacific Coast man in his Cabinet, but that
the factional differences in California ren
dered it difficult to make a selection from
that State. In all these conversations he
dwelt upon the name of Judge McKenna,
who served with him upon the Ways and
Means Committee in the Fifty-first Con
gress when the McKinley tariff bill was
formulated.
It is said by Culifornians here that Mr.
McKinley has always entertained a hieh
opinion of Judge McKenna's ability, and
furthermore, that quite a warm friendship
was established between the two during
their service together on the Ways and
Means Committee.
Senator Perkins and others of the Cali
fornia delegation were seen by The Call
correspondent to-nieht and asked if they
had any definite information that Major
MrKinley was considering Judge Mc-
Kenna in connection with an appoint
CAPTAIN MERRY MAY BE APPOINTED.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 20.â 1t is not impossible that Captain William L. Merry of Ban Francisco will be appointed
Commissioner of Navigation under the Treasury Department. Boards of Trade and Chambers of Commerce of California
have taken an active interest in his behalf, and The Call correspondent learns to-night that Captain Merry will ba in
dorsed for this place probably by all of the California delegation.
Senator Perkins paid high tribute to the ability and character of Captain Merry, who has been president of the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce and is now connected with it. Senator Perkins said he believed that no better appoint
ment could be made. It would be oi vast benefit to the shipping interest of the Pacific Coast, as the captain was familiar
with every part of it. He had been a sailor "before the mast" as well as captain of a vessel, and knew every want of ship
ping interests of the coast.
Senator Perkins also complimented Captain Merry's literary ability, and said that his contributions to Nicaragua canal
literature were invaluable, and would prove to be of vast benefit in the attempt to secure the passage of the Nicaragua
canal bill. Apropos of tbe canal. Representative Barham said to The Call correspondent to-night that in a few days he
and other members of the House will wait upon Speaker Reed and the Rules Committee in an endeavor to have that com
mittee set a time for consideration for the bill. Mr. Barham believes that the opposition to the bill is weakening, and be
is hopeful that it may be passed.
ment. AH acknowledged that, they had
heard reports of that kind from gentlemen
recently arrived from Canton, but they
had not attached any importance to them
until the last few days. Senator Perkins
admitted that he had received informa
tion to ibis effect from some Californians
who had recently come from Canton, and
while he said that he bad no means of
knowing McKinley's intentions, declared
that it would not surprise him if the ten
der of a Cabinet position should be made
to Judge McKenna, inasmuch as the two
were well acquainted and the President
elect had such a high opinion of the Judge.
The Call correspondent asked Senator
Perkins whether it was true, as reported
here, that tbe California delegation, after
recommending Horace Davis for a Cabinet
position, had concluded not to send such
a recommendation to Major McKinley in
view of certain letters received from Cali
fornia since the delegation met in caucus
and indorsed Davis.
Mr. Perkins said : "It is true that letters
have been received from California, but it
is not true that the delegation has con
cluded to withdraw its indorsement of
Mr. Davis. Acting in my capacity as
chairman of the conference of the dele
gation I appointed a committee of three
to draft that memorial to Major Mc-
Kinley, expressing the pleasure of that
caucus. It is understood that Major Mc-
Kinley has left Canton and is now in
Chicago, and the memorial could not with
propriety be sent to him until he returns
home."
"But how long will the delegation wait
before forwarding the memorial to him ?"
Senator Perkins was asked.
â¢'That I cannot tell," said he, "ai the
committee of three has charge of the
memorial."
It is believed here that, although the
delegation has not decided to withdraw
its indorsement of Davis, they have con
cluded to "make haste slowly" and to
withhold the indorsement as expressed in
the memorial to Major McKinley until
they have had a chance to hear the popu
lar expression of Californians in all sec
tions of the State. In other words the in
dorsement of Davis was merely a "feeler."
Representative Loud is considerably dis
turbed on account of reports sent from
Washington stating that at the caucus he
had declared he bad authority to with
draw De Young's name. Mr. Loud's em
barrassment is not lessened any by the
receipt of the press cablegram from De
Young stating that Mr. Loud did not
state in so many words to the caucus that
he had authority from Mr. de Young to
withdraw his name, but that he stated
that he bad heard De Young say in the
presence of two otfier gentlemen that he
was not a candidate for a Cabinet place
and that this statement of Loud's caused
Grove Johnson to cast his vote for Davis.
GREETED WITH APPLAUSE.
Major IHcKinleti Cannot Etoape Admi-
ration Even on Sunday.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 20.â A burst of
applause with the same hearty cries sur
prised and greeted Major McKinley when
his carriage drove up to tbe Sixth Presby
terian Church on Vernon avenue this
morning. The sidewalk was crowded with
people who were unable to find seats in
the house of worship. Scores of persons
lingered about tbe vestibule, the doors
and the street in front of the church dur
ing the service, and when Major McKln
iey came out after the morning services
the cheering and applauding was repeated.
Consideration of the day and place did
not restrain these enthusiastic ChicaÂ«o
admirers of the President-elect. It was
partially to avoid similar demonstrations
that Major McKinley remained so quietly
at the homes of his friends during the
week and declined invitations to visit any
of the theaters. He did not suppose en
thusiasm would express itself so emphati
cally on the Sabbath.
Major and Mrs. McKinley drove to the
West Side after church and dined with a
relative. The rest of the day was spent
very quietly.

Cause of the Fierce Fire in the Missouri
Penitentiary Traced to a Plot
of Convicts.
JEFFERSON, Mo., Dec 20.â The source
of last night's fire in State Prison has been
traced to a gang of thirty-three convicts,
some one of whom fired a bundle of refuse
under a stairway in the clothing depart
ment. Tbe fire smoldered until nearly
midnight, when it burst into a blaze. Tne
incendiary act was no doubt done in a
hope to escape during the confusion. Not
withstanding the great excitement War
den Payne and the guards at no time lost
control of tbe prisoners. The clothing de
partment is located in cell building 1, and
while the guards were transferring the
convicts from this building into cell build
ing 3 two convicts attempted to escape,
but both were captured before they got
away from the building. Great bravery
was shown by the convicts, who were re
leased from their cells to help extinguist
the fire. A convict from St. Louis, who
at one time belonged to the fire depart
ment of that city, acted as captain to the
Sate Fire Department! The Star Cloth
ing Company, which is also situated in
the same building as the State Depart
ment, was at one time in great danger of
having its entire stock of clothing de
stroyed.

BARCELONA, Spain, Dec. 20.â Eight
of the anarchists who were convicted of
complicity in the bomb throwing that
occurred here in June last have been sen
tenced to death by the court-martial, be
fore which they were tried. The Attorney-
General, who personally conducted thÂ«
prosecution, asked the court-martial to
sentence twenty-eight of the prisoners to
death and fifty-six to penal servitude for
life. The proceedings were markeri with
the strictest secrecy, it being feared that
the anarchists, of whom there are many in
Barcelona, would make a demonstration if
the fact of condemnation and sentencing of
the prisoners should become generally
known. The court-martial met in a vault
in the fortress of Mont Juich, and only
military officers were allowed to be pres
ent at the trial.
The crime for which the eight anarchists
will suffer death was committed on June
7, on the occasion of a religious procession
in celebration of Corpus Christi. Just as
the procession was entering the Church of
Sania Maria de la Mara bomb was thrown
into the crowd that was watching the
ceremony. The missile exploded with
ereat violence, killing twelve persons in
stantly and wounding fifty others, some
of whom subsequently A large
number of arrests were made, and eighty

trial. Eight of them will be shot. It 13

liable to experience as the result of over-

Then too if Nature be assisted a little

Of all known agents for this purpose,

Their secondary effect is to keep the

Hence, their great popularity with suf-

SUSPENSION OF
A NATIONAL BANK
Capital Imperiled by Some
Most Unwarranted
Loans.
Other Failures May Follow the
Collapse of the Well-Known
Concern.
There Is Twelvs Million Dol'ars in
Deposits That May Be Tied Up
by the Failure.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 2Lâ The National
Back of Illinois has been suspended by
the clearing-house. It is said the bank
will not open its doors in the morning.
The officers of the National Bank of Illi
nois are: George Schneider, president;
Walter L. Peck, vice-president; William
A. Hammond, second vice-president, and
Carl Moll, cashier. The bank is located at
115 Dearborn street.
The action suspending the bank was
taken at a specially called meeting of the
Clearing-House Association. The meet
ing was called at tbe residence of E bridge
Keith, who is secretary of the committee,
and was held shortly after midnight. It
was shown that the bank had made un
warrantable and injudicious loans, and
that in consequence the capital and sur
plus of the bank have been seriously im
periled. It is believed that many failures
will result from the collapse of the Na
tional Bank of Illinois.
The resolution adopted by the Clearing
house committee is as follows:
Whereas, The attention oi this committee
has been lately called to the administration ot
the affairs of the National Bank of Illinois,
and it now appears, through statements ioa.de
to this committee by one of the vice-presidents
of said bank acd from the reports of tbe Na
tional Bank Commissioner, that by reason of
unwarrantable and injudicious loans the cap
ital and surplus of said bank is seriously im
periled if not entirely lost; now, therefore.
Resolved, That under the powers couierred
upou this committ c by the by-laws of the
Clearing-bouse Association of Chicago, we go
hereby suspend said National Bank of. Illinois
from the privileges of membership In said as
sociation, to take effect immediately.
Resolved, That the secretary of this com
mittee be and he is hereby instructed to
a copy of these resolutions to each member of
the association and to report the same at a
general meeting of the association, to be held
on Monday, December 21, at 3:30 o'clock p. m.
Iv taking this action the committee deems
It proper to say:
Firstâ That the cuh reserves of the bank
are within the requirements of law, and if as
a result of this action said bank should sus
pend payment and liquidate its liabilities a
large and speedy dividend will be made avail
able to creditors.
Secondâ lt is the declared opinion of the of
ficers and directors of the bank that its re
sources are ample to pay all its liabilities Ih
full, and it is the opinion of this committee
that adjusted claims against said bank may be
considered ample collateral security for loans
of 75 per cent of their face value. And m
event of liquidation of said bank we will rec
ommend to the association banks an arrange
ment whereby such loans may be available to
creditors of laid bank as their convenience
may require.

LESS DANGER OF
WAR WITH SPAIN
[ Continued from First Paoe.\
Foreign Affairs, and the entire Congress
for that matter. The story of General An
tonio Maceo's death â and there seems to
be little doubt but that ha was ambushed â
has had much to do with the determina
tion ot Congress to take immediate action.
"The stories of shocking brutality with
which the Spanish treated the children
and families of insurgents have also had a
strong effect upon the most conser
vative members of the committee. The
resolution will be taken up immediately
after the holidays, I think, and will be
discussed perhaps ten or twelve days, and
then passed up to the President. From
Secretary Olney's letter the almost certain
inference is that Cleveland will veto the
resolution.
"But it is within the limits of the power
of Congress to pass the bill ovtr the veto,
and that can be done, I think, without
any doubt. Secretary Olney's position in
claiming that the power to issue such a
mandate rests with the Chief Executive is
wrong.* When a joint resolution is passed
by a sufficient majority it is a law, and
the power to recognize Cuba's independ
ence remains with Congress, which is
made up of a body of men elected by the
people and voicing the people's senti
ments.. When that sentiment is em
phatically expressed over the power of
veto '.he President is merely the instru
carry out its behests. Thus Congress has
the powe*r to declare war and make
peace."
"Do you think Spain would declare
war?"
"I think thaje is no probability of it. It
would be inertly a bloff if she did. Spain
i.i eiu.iuÂ».fU ami poVci iy-3iricaeu au-Â« it
would be the sheerest lolly for her to take
up arms against a country like this."
"Does the passage of the resolution
mean Cuban independence?"
"Nothing else, as I can see. That is the
whole size of it, and the sooner it is done
the better. The United States is the
guardian of this hemisphere and under
the circumstances it is her bounden duty
to interfere."
SPANIARDS YET CELEBRATING
They Take It for Granted That General
Macro Is Dead.
HAVANA, Cuba, Dec. 20.â The demon
strations of joy over the death of Maceo
have not yet ended. There was a largely
attended excursion to-day from Havana to
Punta Brava in honor of Major Cirujeda's
column which kiiled the rebel leader.
The affair was organized by natives of Ga
iicia, Major Cirujeda's native province,
and was made the occasion for a great dis
play of patriotic enthusiasm. Many
speeches were made on the trip predicting
the speedy collapse of the rebellion and
exalting the performances of the Spanish
soldiery. When the excursionists arrived
at Punta Brava they were received by the
officers of Major Cirujeda's column and
there were further speeches and jubila
tion. Gifts were presented to the officers
of the command and a banquet was given
to the men. Most of the prominent Gal
iejosin the city took part in the excursion.
CANNOT PASS AT PRESENT
Western Conqreistnen Talk About the
f atneron Resolution.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec. 20.â A number of
Congressmen on the way home for the
holidays spent Sunday in Chicago. Rep
resentative Perkins of lowa was seen by
a United Associated Presses reporter and
asked re>;ardini; Cameron's resolution.
"The chances are," said he, "that Con
gress will do nothing with the Cameron
resolution before the 4th of March. The
House o! Representatives is disposed to be
more conservative than some of the news
papers make it. My observation is that
opinion is in favor of considering the mat
ter carefully, and if the Speaker is not in
favor of the resolution it may never get
out of the committee. It is likely, too,
that it may not come ovpt from the Senate
much before the first of February.''
The belief is current among the Western
members of Congress who were here to
day that Major McKinley would not iook
with favor upon an}' action by Congress
on the Cuban question which savored of
haste and undue excitement.

HAVEHEYER AND
THE ARBUCKLES
New Turn in the Merry
War Between the Great
Rival Concerns.
Tha Sugar Trust Tryirg to Kee^
the Coffee and Spice Men
Out ot Competition.
Now the American Refining Company
Secures the Woolson Mills, but
May Compromise'
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 20.â 1f the
report that the American Refining Com
pany, Known as the sujrar trust, has se
cured the Spice Company of Toledo be
true it is not improbable that the result
may be a deal between the trust and
Arbuckle Bros. The Arbuckles may
abandon their intention to build a sugar
rehnery in consideration of the sugar
trust turning over to them the Woolson
Company. The Ar buckles proposed to
build a refinery with a capacity of 2000
barrels a day. or, practically, 600,000 bar
rels a year. This is a big trade to lose.
There would be more money for the tru*t
in keeping it than in going into the coffee
trust and grinding business in opposition
to the Arburkles. There is some reason
for the trust engaging in the distilling of
spirits, for it can utilize the product of
its sugar refineries, which now largely
goes to waste. It has not yet started up
its distillery in Brooklyn.
The tight between the sugar trust and
the Arbuckles began a year ago. About
that time the Arbuckles particularly
wanted a large lot of sugar for their coffee
trade, which the trust could not or would
not furnish. The Arbuckles were pro
voked and at once began planning to
mate sugar for themselves. They opened
negotiations for the purchase of the Cam
den (N. J. ) sugar refinery, which was in
course of construction and was recently
finished. The trust stepped in and bought
the refinery, whereupon the Arbuckles de
clared tueir intention to build a refinery
adjacent to their coffee works in Brook
lyn. The trust decided to make war on
the Arbuckles. It fitted up one of its idle
refineries with a coffee-roasting outfit.
This outfit stands idle to-day, because the
trust found a belter move could be made
by buying out the Arbuckles' principal
competitor, the Woolson Company. Be
fore this was done, it U said, the trust
learned that the Arbuckles had under
taken a bull deal in coffee and bad loaded
up with a large lot of green coffee. The
trust 6aw its opportunity to force down
coffee. The fir.^t drop took place last week.
The su^ar trust has offered to exchange
its common stock, dollar for dollar, for
the stock of the Baltimore Sugar Refinery,
and to pay par in cash for the preferred
stock. The offer Das been accepted. The
trust owned a majority of stock of the
Baltimore rehnery, and when it put in its
own directors and shut down the refinery
the minority stockholders raised a fight.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec 20.â A special
from Toledo. Ohio, says: The immense
deal by which the sugar trust comes into
the control of the Woolson Spice Com
pany has been closed and the money paid
over. Notwithstanding the fact that
Havemeyer's agents have been in Toledo
for a month, nobody but the directors of
the Woolson Company was aware of the
fact. Lawrence Newman has been in
New York for a week to close the deal and
the transfer. One singular fact is, not
withstanding tbe big price paid, the
Woolson people were forced into making
the deal. Havemeyer desired to make a
fight on Arbuckle. and to do it it was
necessary he should meet him in his own
field â coffee.
When first approached tbe Woolson
people asked $1500 a share. Havemeyer
refused to treat on such terms. Hf wou d
give $1000. Havemeyer was willing to put
$2,000,000 or thereabouts in the purchase
of a club with whica to thrash ArbucKle.
This was some weeks ago. It was found
that the book value of stock was over
$1200. He threatened to establish a coffee
plant and go into business on a lame
scale. He would cut prices so that tbe
competition would hurt the W T oolson peo
ple quite as much as it would the Ar
buckles.
Mr. Newman went on to New York and
saw Mr. Havemeyer and an agreement
was reached. It was that tbe sugar trust
people should get 1100 of the 1800 shares
of stock at $1150 per share. So the sale in
round numbers was $1,265,000 for eleven
eighteenths of the entire stock. So se
cretly were the negotiations conducted
that it is said smaller stockholders were
not aware of the deal until they read it in
the papers yesterday. It is understood in
Toledo that when Havemeyer gets
through with the Arbuckles the prooerty
will revert back to the Toledo owners.
IDLE MEN GROW DESPERATE.
At a Mass-Meeting in Denver Ministers
Join the Unemployed in Denounc
ing the City Council.
DENVER, Colo., Dec 20.â Pour thou
sand men who, by their resolutions, their
statements and their actions, declaimed
that they were out of work, starving, o:
on the verse of starvation, met in the
Coiiseani hall this afternoon and listened
to a number of red-hot speecbes against
the City Council. The meeting was held in
the Coliseum hall in response to a call.
The speakers were Rev. Thomas Uzzell
and Rev. Myron W. Reed, the gentlemen
who have always been considered friends
of the oppressed and needy.
The former suggested that the quickest
way to bring about a change for the better
was to take out half a dozen members of
the City Council and bury them in the
bed of Cherry Creek as a warning to their
successors that the condition of the work
ingmen should not be so cruelly over
looked and slighted in order that the poli
ticians could fatten their own purses at
the expense of the many.
The resolutions passed called for the
construction of city water works, street
paving, viaducts, etc., anything to keep
the unemployed busy, that the mouths of
the hungry might be fed, instead of pay
ing ont trie money in interest to bankers.
Rev. Mr. Reed intimated that violence
might be used by reminding his hearers
that under the constitution they have yet
left to them the privilege of carrying arms,
stating that "We may yet be called upon
to exercise that prerogative."
Previous to the meeting there was a par
ade. The marchers carried banners, some
of the inscriptions being: "Cheerless
Christmas for the Working-man," "We
Want Work, Not Charity," "Work In
stead of the Poorhouse," and a number of
others ou the same lines.
THE GREAT INAUGURAL
Preparations for the Fourth of March
â bearing Completion.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 20.â The
inauguration committee bas fairly got
down to work and preparations for the
ceremonies of March 4 next are being rap
idly completed. Nearly all of the numer
ous committees have been' organized and
the details of the work are being system
atically arranged and apportioned.
The general committee has decided that
the inaugural ball is to be held in the
great hall of the pension building, al
though many of the inemDers of the com
mittee, including Chairman Hanna, were
in favor of having the ball in the magnifi
cent new library building. It was feared
that the library building â one of the band
soruest in the worldâ might be damaged
by so large a crowd as is expected, and the
building riot being very well adapted for
the purpose on account of the size of the
rooms and corridor this plan was aban
doned by an almost unanimous vote. Tbe
immense court of the pension building,
with its hundreds of adjoining rooms, is
admirably suited for such a gathering.
Railroad rates have bagn fixed at one
fare for the round trip Trom all points
north as far as Buffalo and as far west as
Peoria, 111., and SL Louis, and similar
rates will probably be made from points
further west and south. The arrange
ments contemplate the largest number of
visitors that ever came to Washington
upon a like occasion.
RETURNS WITH FAT DUCK.
President Cleveland Concludes His
Shooting nn<i Is Again at the Capital
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 20.â The
President returned to the White House at
8 o'clock this morning and attended
church a little later with Mrs. Cleveland.
He appeared much benefited by his out
ing and brought back numerous fat ducks,
which he caused to be distributed among
â he members of his cabinet and his per
sonal friends. Secretary Thurber called
to see him and spent some time telling;
him of events that had occurred during
iiis absence, but no official business was
taken up and it is not believed that the
President feels called upon to add any
thing to the Cuban controversy at present.
During tbe day Secretary Olney made
his appearance at the executive mansion
and bad a brief consultation with the
President, and while there is no official
uarautee for the assertion it is not to be
questioned that- their conversation re
ferred almost solely to the latest phase
in the Cuban situation.
FUNERAL OF BEERMANN
Friends of the Decextett JUngielan Turn
Out in Pull' tore:
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 20.â The
funeral of Alexander Herrmann, the
magician, was held at Masonic Temple,
Sixth avenue and Twenty-third street,
this afternoon. The large ball was
crowded with the friends of the deceased.
A choir from the Temple Emanu-El sang

about the casket and Charles Heiser con
ducted the Masonic rites of burial.
A I the conclusion the body was taken

The pall-bearers included Maurice Gran,
Frank Sang<*r, Alfred Hayman, William
H. Crane and Franfc McKee. A large

WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 20.- If the
programme of the Senate made before the
Cuban question took such an acute form
is permitted to be carried out the Senate
will discuss the Oklahoma Homestead
bill, which is the unfinished business.
The beginning of the holiday recess,
with the adjournment on Tuesday gives
but two days for business in the House
and there is small prospect of a quorum.
Consideration of the legislative, executive
and judicial appropriation bill, which is
the unfinished business, will resume to
morrow and the measure will probably be
disposed of unless the Horary scheme pro
posed by the joint committee as a substi
tute for the provisions reported by the
committee should require the presence of a
quorum, in which case the bill will go over
until after the holidays.
Wool- Grower* and the Tariff.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 20.â 1t is
the intention of the wool-growers to urge
that a separate measure be passed, in ad
vance of the regular tariff bill, which will
restore the wool schedule of the McKinley
tariff bill, and accordingly President Law
rence of the National Wool-growers' Asso
ciation has issued a call for the wool
rowers' representatives from all sections
to meet in Washington on January 4. Del
egates will then appear before the Ways
and Means Committee on January 6, the
day set aside to hear the advocates lor an
increased wool tariff.

LABOR LEADERS
MAKE ADDRESSES
President Gompers Appsars
in Wesley Chapel
Pulpit.
In Glowing Words He Paints a
Picture of the Struggles
of Wage-Earners.
Members of tbe Federation Are Active
in the Cause to Which They
Are Devoted.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Dec. 20.â Although
there was no session of the sixteenth an
nual conference of the Federation of
Labor to-day many officers and delegates
of the organization were active in the
cause to which they are devoted, the ad
vancement ol trades unionism. President
Gompers addressed a large audience at 3
o'clock this afternoon in Wesley Chapel,
Methodist Episcopal Church, his subject
being "The Rou h Struggle of a Rugged
Life." During the course of his remarks
Mr. Gompers reviewed the progress of the
labor movement, especially in the United
States. He painted in glowing words a
picture of almost innumerable obstacles
and discouragements that have been met
and overcome in the heroic struggle of
working classes to bring about a condi
tion that would insure to themselves a
just and fair proportion of the earnings of
their labor, and to!d of what it is hoped
will yet be accomplished through the
work and influence of trades unionism.
The advantages of organization were
dwelt on at considerable length, and it
was pointed out that the benefits to be
gained are not for the wage-earners alone,
because as the condition of labor is im
proved so is society, and citizenship raised
to a higher standard.
The manner in which National and in
ternational organizations undertake to
bring about an adjustment of differences
between employes and local labor bodies
so as to give to each side in the contro
versy its just dues, to prevent lockouts,
strikes,etc.,was explained and the necessity
of a universal eight-hour work day strongly
urged. '"Give to the great army of labor,"
said he, "a work day of eight hours, com
pensation that will enable the industiious
to have homes, reasonable comforts in
their homes, the full advantages ol
schools, week-day and Sunday schools,
and churches for their families, and you
will have in this country the highest
standard of society and citizenship ever
attained in this world.
"The B ble," said Mr. Gompers, "both
the Old and New Testaments, are full of
the doctrine we preach." He spoke for an
hour and thirty minutes, holding the
closest attention of his audience through
out and closed with an appeal to the min
istry and all Christian people to aid the
cause of labor by their influence and in
whatever manner it is possible for them
to do so.
A mas-m eeting of bakers, organized
and unorganized, was held this morning
at 9 o'clock. The speakers were President
Gompers, Delegate Henry Weismann of
the Bakers' and Confectioners' Interna
tional Union, Charles F. Bechtold of th*
National Union of Brewery Workers and
W. D. MÂ»hon of the Amalgamated Asso
ciation of Street Railway Employes. Del
ega-e Weismann has been active among
the bakers during the conference and has
organized three non-union bakeries, and
to-night said that he had reason for os
lieving lhat every bakery in the city
would be organized before the close of
tnis week.
At 2 o'clock a mass-meeting of carpen
ters, which was largely attended and at
which there were many non-union men,
was held in Workmen's Hall and ad
dressed by Vice-President McGuire and
Richard Cullinine ot the Lawrence (Mass.)
Central Labor Union.
The three most important matters to
come before the conference to-morrow are
the Olney arbitration bill, a resolution on
foreign immigration and a resolution in
tended to commit the American federa
tion of Labor to the Socialist Labor party.
Pomeroy, the delegate of the Chicago
Hotel and Restaurant Employes' Associa

ence on account of having issned a parti

STOCKTON BARGE RACE
Lightweight Varsmen Win an Exciting
Contest.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 20.â The barge
race on the channel this afternoon brought
oat a large crowd. Three crews entered,
as follows: Lightweightsâ Fred Butler,
stroke; Charles Smith, afterwaist;
Walter Houskin, forward waist; Joe Foley,
bow; John Moore, cockswain. Paper
weightsâC. Davis, stroke; Bert Melone,

swain. Heavy-weiÂ«hts âC. Spencer,
stroke; D. Chapman, afterwaist; J. Burns,
forwardwaist; T. Carkeek, bow; Robert
Inglis, cockswain. The lightweights won
by one length from the paper-weights, and
the heavy-weight crew, made up of most

2 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALLWHERE NEWS IS
HARD TO GATHER
Journalists Not Admitted to
the Parliamentary
Dinner.
One Venturesome Scribe Uses a
Clever Ruse, but Is Soon
Expelled.
Consequently the Details of the Con
versation Between Hoh nlohe and
William Are Meager.
[Copyright, 1896, by the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Geejcajtt, Dec. 20.â The Par
liamentary dinner given on Wednesday
last by the Imperial Chancellor, Prince
yon Hohenlohe, did not attract the at
tention of the press, as has bÂ«en the rule
heretofore upon the occasion of this
function, and consequently less than
usual is known of what actually too*
place there. The reason for this is the
fact that representatives of the press were
entirely excluded from the banquet-hall,
whereas hitherto they have been es
pecially invited to be present. While the
dinner was in progress one journalist
managed to get into the banquet-hall
upon his presentation of a blank invita
tion-card, but he was soon discovered and
unceremoniously expelled.
Reliable echoes of the Emperor's con
versation at the banquet agree that his
Majesty's sympathy is entirely with the
Hamburg employers, and he is represented
as saying that the employers are wholly
lacking in their sense of the importance
of working a general coalition of em
ployers against the unions of the working
men and advising the co-operation of the
German, English and other employers in
devising a scheme of an international
commission upon the conditions of trade
which would benefit not only the em
ployer, but the employe as well.
In regard to the Hamburg strike it may
be said that all of the prospects of the
success of the strikers are extremely
gloomy. The dispatches which have been
cabled during the past week, while giving
a general outline of the situation, really
told nothing of the actual condition of af
iairs. The fact is that the strikers
and their families are suffering terribly
for lack of food, clothing, shelter, etc., and
it is reported the amounts contributed by
subscription from various sources to the
fund for the support of the strikers have
either not been paid at ail or have been
very injudiciously distributed. In conse
quence of this state or things the men are
losing heart and many of them are seeking
reinstatement, but the masters remain ob
durate and refuse to permit any of them
to return until the strike is finally ended.
At the beginning of the strike the em
ployers offered to pay 4 shillings 6 pence
for a day of twelve hours, including meal
times, but the strikers demanded 5 shil
lings a day with overtime. The employers
are now regulating the offer toeether with
a reference oi matters in dispute to their
inquiry suggested by the Hamburg Senate
with a view of preparing a method of set
tling disputes Dy negotiations between the
employers and employes, and it is prob
able that despite the fact that at the ballot
ing at yesterday's meeting some of the
strikers voted in favor of continuing the
strike, the offer will be accepted in the
early part of this week.
The Emperor at Prince Hohenlohe's
dinner on Wednesday conversed for some
time with Herr yon Levetzow, formerly
President of the Reichstag, and it is sup
posed that ihe^ subject ot the conversation
was the matter of acceptance by Herr yon
Levetzow of the presidency of the Prus
sian Upper House, which has been de
clined by Prince Solms Hohensolms Lich
on the ground of ill health. The Prince
was elected to the office, but he positively
refused to serve.
The scandals which resulted in the ar
rest of Major Baron yon Tausch, chief of
the political police.for forgery and perjury,
upon which charges he is now in jail
awaiting trial, are Hill being generally
discussed in the newspapers and in the
cafes and other public places. The Ber
liner Tageblatt, which paper was shown
up during the trial of Baron yon Luetzow
as the home of one of the agents of Tausch,
now turns daily somersaults in an en
deavor to demonstrate its loyalty to the
Foreign Office and vehemently denounces
the at one time supposed connection of
Tausch with Prince Bismarck and Count
Herbert Bismarck as the grossest cal
umny against the ex-Chancellor and his
son.
The Tageblatt, the Hanover Courier and
other newspapers inspired from a com
mon source are conducting an agitation
with the object of obtaining the arrest of
Normann Schumann, alias Mundt, wno
was for a long time an active agent of
Tausch and at the same time an occa
sional correspondent of a New York news
paper and a secret agent of the Porte.
Mundt maintains a villa on Lake Lucerne
in Switzerland, and has long enjoyed the
confidence of the German embassies in
Rome and Constantinople. He has reaped
a rion harvest as a secret agent ail around
and has been able to effect the expulsion
of foreign journalists from Berlin if they
became obnoxious to him. Mundt has not
yet been arrested, arid it is reported that
he has fled from Lucerne to Canstanti
nople; but his presence is likely to be de
manded in Berlin upon the occasion of the
coming trial of Tausch.
The event of the American colony in
Berlin in the last week was the charity
concert of the Grail Lodge of the Ameri
can Theosophical Society in Berlin, which
was held in" the Hotel Rome last evening.
United States Embassador Jhl, Mrs. Uhl,
Miss Alice Uhl, Marshall Uhl, Consul-
General de Kay, Mrs. de Kay and Vice-
Consul-Generai Zimmerman were present.
The artists were Mi>s Mary Hnwel Avins,
Miss Leonora Jackson and Ernest Jack
son. After the concert there was a supper,
and Mrs. Uiil distributed to a number of
poor girls the material contributions, the
object of the concert, consisting of
dresses, hats, boots, under-garments, etc.
The situation in regard to Cuba created
by the action of the Foreign Relations
Committee cf the UniteJ States Senate in
agreeing to a resolution recognizing the
independence of the island caused the
Berlin and Frankfort bourses to open
weak yesterday, and greatly checkei the
transaction of business in American se
curities until advices were received from
London showing that confidence was
practically unshaken there. This newt
had the effect to restore confidence here
and in Frankfort, and prices recovered,
but ciosed a fraction low*r on the day.
At the request, of the Emperor the mili
tary court will reopen the inquiry in the
case of Lieutenant Baron yon Brusewitz,
who was sentenced to four years' confine
ment in a fortress for killing an artisan
named Siebman in a cafe in Carlsruhe a
short time ago because Siebman refused
to apologize for an in&ult to Brusewitz
w hich he declared he had not offered to
him, and the Emperor will postpone bis
condemnation of the sentence pending the
inquiry.
There are conflicting reports as to the
Emperor's reason for hit action, one of
which is that the Kaiser favors Brusewitz
and hope? that the inquiry will result to
his advantage. Another report, however,
ascribes the course taken by the Emperor
to his Majesty's belief that the military
tribunal which condemned Brasewitz was
altogether too lenient with him.
The long pending suit of Captain yon
Straubeck against the Brothers Otto and
Hugo Dammarch for having made false
accusations against him h.xs been settlea.
The case grew out of remarks made by
Herr Bebel, the Socialist leader, in a
speech in the Reichnag In 1895, in which
he mentioned the case of brutality on tne
part of the military officers toward their
solaieys and asserted that the conduct of
Captain yon Straubeck furnishei an ex
amp.e ot" such brutality in his having fre
quently struck soiuiers with his fists,
kicked them until they were incapacitated
from duty or struck them with the flat of
his sword. In the course of his speech
Herr Bebel quoted the Brothers Dam
march as authority for the assertions he
had made.
Captain yon Straubeck publicly denied
the charges made against him and caused
warrants to be issued for the arrest of the
jjammarch brothers. Otto fled when he
heard of the issuance of the warrants, but
Hugo remained and stood trial and was
sentenced to four months' imprisonment.
The drift of the evidence taken at the trial
showed that 'although Captain Straubeck
was a martinet, he had not struck his
men.
The Berliner Bank has decided to in
crease its capital from 7,500,000 marks to
20.000,000 marks. In consequence of the
new bourse law, which coes into opera
tion on January 1, the Berlin and other
bourses are discussing the question of the
dissolution of exchange institutions and
conducting business atter th 6 new law
goes into effect as free associations with
out any formal external organization.
The Produce Exchange, at Halle, has al
ready dissolved in accordance with this
scheme.
Herr Heartling, former director of the
Berlin Mortgage Bank, who was recently
sentenced to penal servitude for forgery,
has committed suicide in his cell in prison.
W. S. Carroll, United States Conaul-
General at Dresden, gave a grand recep
tion at his residence in that city to-day.
It is reported that Herr Otlo Fioors
heim, the Berlin critic of the New York
Musical World, has been given aa honor
ary professorship upon the occasion of the
coming birthday of the Emperor, which
occurs on January 27.
United States Consul-General Charles de
Kay had a narrow escape from a fatal
accident through the collision of his car
riage with another vehicle, while going
from his office to his house, on the night
of his recent official reception. The shaft
of the colliding cab passed through Mr. de
Kay's carriage and missed his head by
only about an inch. Had the shaft strucK
him he certainly would have been killed.

Victim of a Mob.
MAYFIELD, Ky., Dec. 20.â A mob of
white men broke into the cabin of George
Finley, a negro, near here late Friday

hours of terrible agony.

NEW YORK, N. V., Dec 20.â James

drographer and nautical publisher in this
city, were cabin boys on the same ship.
He commanded the packet ship Albany in
1832, and in 1837 was made captain of the
fine new Havre packet Virginian. The
Virginian was chosen by the Government
to bring the French indemnity money to
this country of generations ago. About
fifty years ago Captain Watson retired
from business and went to live with his
family on the ancestral estate in West

recollection of the war of 1812.

LEXINGTON, Ky., Dec 20.â Hainey
Jordan, the woman who assisted Marie!
Hatfield in the murder of Jonas Trail, for
which crime Hatfield was banged last
week, barely escaped lynching JfViday
night. She was stopping in a cabin near
Cold's store. A number of Trail's friends
surrounded the cabin, intending to lynch
her for the part she played in killing
Trail. She dressed herself in men's
clothes and boldly walked out at the back
door. While the men were waiting for her
to appear she climbed up the mountain
and escaped.

ARGUMENTS NOT
BASED ON FACTS
Huntington's Plea to the
Harbor Commission
Outlined.
Southern Pacific Claims That
Expert Testimony Will
Disprove.
Shipmasters Will Strike Hard Blows
at tbe Santa Monica
Scheme.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 20.â The
Government Deep-water Harbor Commis
sioners spent a quiet Sunday in this city.
The real tug-of-war between the contend
ing factions over the location of a deep
sea harbor for Southern California will
commence to-morrow forenoon in the re
ception-rooms of the Chamber of Com
merce building, where the first open ses
sion of the board will be # held.
It has been agreed between Hemy Haw
good and Robert Moore of the Free Har
bor Leacue, who are advocating the
claims of San Pedro, and William
Corthell and C. L. Hood, Southern Pacific
engineers, who will present the Santa
Monica side of the question, that at the
public meeting for the hearing of evi
dence the Santa Monica advocates should
present the opening argument and state
ments and that the San Pedro claimants
will follow with the presentation of their
testimony. The Santa Monica people will
then have an opportunity for rebuttal,
after which the San Pedro advocates will
ciose the discussion. The board, it is un
derstood, has agreed to accord to each
side all the time desired in presenting its
arguments.
In view of the enormous amount of
data collected it may require a number of
days to go over the whole ground. The
Commissioners have repeatedly said that
they desired all the light possible regard
ing both sites, and would give ample time
for the purpose.
In their argument, Engineers Corthell
and Hood will declare that since the big
wharf has been constructed at Santa
Monica Canyon, the experience of ship
masters has shown the wisdom of the
location. This is true only in part. In
ordinary weather vessels successfully dis
charge their cargoes at Mr. Huntington's
wharf, but in this respect San Pedro
possesses equal if not superior advantages.
The preference for San Pedro among
marine insurance men emphasizes this fact,
They make a much lower rate on cargoes
bound lor San Pedro than on those for
Santa Monica. This bit of information
will doubtless be eschewed by Messrs.
Corthell and Hood of the monopoly.
It will be urged by the Santa Monica
advocates that the holding ground at
San Pedro is not good. A complete refuta
tion of this statement is supplied by the
testimony ol more than forty shipmasters,
published in the official reports, while it
was found very difficult to drum up any
similar evidence in favor of Santa Monica.
The Southern Pacific will assent that
the water near San Pedro is exceedingly
deep, and that, therefore, the swell is
greater than at Santa Monica, where tbe
depth, while adequate, is much less. An
inspection of the charts published by the
coast survey shows the incorrectness of
this statement.
It will be claimed that the proposed
breakwater at San Pedro is not- protected j
from southeast gales; that, therefore, the j
locality is not desirable for harbor pur
poses. This subject has been carefully
considered in the official reports, and the
conclusion reached is that no danger is to
be anticipated from southern gales.
It should be remarked in this connec
tion that tbe inner harbor of San Pedro,
which is conceded to be perfectly shel
tered, and upon the surface of which
scarcely a ripple is ever observed, is largely
exposed to the so-called dangerous south
east gales. Yet a ship within that inner
harbor has never been disturbed thereby.
Other arguments will be advanced in
favor of Santa Monica â that it can lurnish
better fresh water than San Pedro ; that it
presents a better site for a city, and that
it is more attractive as a place of resort
and residence. These are not worthy of
serious consideration, even supposing that
they were well founded. The purpose
sought is to establish a deep-water harbor
for the convenience of commercial inter
ests and as a suitable point for National
defense, not for a summer and pleasure
resort. ________ _____
DENOUNCES LYMAN ABBOTT.
Washington's Governor- Elect Answers Re-
flections Upon the Declaration of
Independence.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 20.â 1n the first
of a series of powerful articles on funda
mental principles of government, written
for the Morning Union, GoTernor-elect
John Rogers holds Rev. Lyman Abbott
up to contempt because of his reflections
upon the Declaration of Independence.
Rogers points out the rule of brute force
among ancient and savage races, and holds
that the same methods are exercised to
day in different form, when under the
cloak of laws designed to protect the
financially powerful advantage is taken
by the privileged few of the weak and de
pendent masses. Says he:
When our fathers formed the United States
production and distribution were compara
tively free. Vast stretches of fertile soil were
before them, measurably free to whoever
chose to occupy and use. Distribution, too,
â was largely under control of the individual.
The iror horse did not then compete with the
farmer's teams. The power of individna.l man
was vastly greater over his own career than
to-day.
Now, manâ the average manâ is constantly
belittled and made to feel his inferiority in
the presence of pompous wealth. Money is
increasing in its power and its demands; nor
Is there anything refused to it by our laws, for
whatever its demands over production ana
distribution may be, they are held to be legal
ana, therefore, just, even though, like a
frightful juggernaut, it crushes under it*
â wheels countless thousands for whom Christ
wept and prayed and died.
And so debased have become the occupants
of many of our pulpits that, having forgotten
the precepts of him who proclaimed the value
of one soul as of greater worth than the whole
world of wealth; having put behind them the
rule of him who would have men do unto
others only as they would have others do to
them, now defend the approaching car of
Mammon, telling the poor creatures who
writhe under its wheels that it is the fault of
the victims themselves that Mammon rides
roughshod over the hopes and heaven-born
aspirations of the poor.
Jefferson, in our Declaration of Independ
ence, declares; "We hold these truths to be
self-evident that all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their creator with
certain inalienable rights."
This is plain. Certain rightsv powers and
privileges are RiveD to man by the Creator or
by nature. They come tob.lm from God. They
are bis and not another's, but if we step in
and deny our brother free exercise 01 what
is given him by nature we come into opposi
tion of the laws of nature. In scriptural lan
guage, "We fight against God," and this is
just what men are doing who deny to their
brother gifts of a common father.
It is true that superserviceable priest of the
sod Mammon who occupies a pulpit in Brook
lyn has lately told hie hearers that the Declara
tion of Independence was a fanciful presenta
tion of untrutb, and that hi' no longer be
lieved it. As for niysi'lf, I leave so contempt
ible a despiser of things American to the
scorn and loathing ot the future, sure to cover
his name with oDloquy and reproach.
SUNDAY AT FRESNO'S FAIR.
Workingmen Pass Into the Pavilion to
View the Display of Luscious
Fruits.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 20.â The citrus fair
had a very good attendance to-day, con
sidering the fine weather for driving and
other outdoor sports. There was a crowd
at the shooting range, a crowd out to see
the new Belmont bicycle track and crowds
at the churches, the latter in particular
not losing any in the way or attendance on
account of the fair. The pavilion was
comfortably filled in the afternoon and
this evening the attendance was much
larger.
It was workingmen's day at tbe fair.
Those who could not come during the
week took advantage of the Sunday op
portunity. Sunday being the farmer's
day off as well as the workingman's. it
was expected that the fruit-growers and
ranchers of this vicinity would drive into
town in greater numbers than they did to
visit the fair. But the farmer evidently
concluded that he had had enough of the
fair on Saturday or mat there were others
to attend the fair. The majority of him
remained at home and enjoyed there a
day that was particularly bright with sun
shine and exceptionally invigorating at
mosphere.
A special musical programme was ren
dered by Justy's band, which everybody
who visited the fair has considered an ex
cellent musical organization. The pro
gramme consisted mostly of sacred music.
Tue excellent choir of the Christian
church appeared- at the pavilion in the
afternoon, and, taking a position on the
bandstand, rendered several hymns. The
choir was heartily applauded and encored.
Three members ot the Apollo Vocal Club
assist d the choir.
To-morrow will be tbe last day of the
fair. Fresno and vicinity will turn out
nobly in order to give the box-office a
final lift. The fair has been a great suc
cess as an exhibition of what the valley
can do in the way of raising citrus fruits.
The exhibit has astonished the whole
State, for there is hardly a section of Cali
fornia that has not been represented in
the attendance.
Second only in importance to the de
monstrated fact that the San Joaquin Val
ley can raise as good oranges, lemons and
other citrus fruits as the southern part of
the State, is the additional fact, even as
effectively illustrated, that the crop of
those fruits are ripe and ready for market
from one month to six weeks earlier than
they are in any other section of the State.
Financially tbe fair will not be as great
a success as it has been otherwise. The
receipts will reach about $4000, while tbe
expenses are a little over $5000. But the
general committee of the fair, and the en
terprising citizens who subscribed to the
guarantee fund of $5000, are in a very good
humor at the results achieved in the way
of showing tbe earth and the people
thereof what Fresno and tne counties of
the valley can do; and they are not only
willing, it is saia, but glad to make up the
small difference between the receipts and
expenses, if there is any when the doors
of the pavilion close to-morrow night.
TACOMA PASTORS SCHEME.
Favors the Introduction of Billiards and
Other Games in a House of
Worship.
TACOMA, Wash., Dec. 20.â Rev. W. H.
Scudder, pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church, this morning created a
sensation by openly hinting that his house
of worship should be changed into a mod
ern institutional church. He cited nu
merous instances of churches in Eastern
cities where pool and billiard playing,
bowling and other amusements were run
in connection with the salvation of souls,
and closed by saying:
"The matter is in your hands, brethren.
We will soon be in the new year."
The congregation takes it as an argu
ment favorable to the establishment of
such features here. Some members favor
submitting a definite plan of reorganiza
tion on new lines, but many strongly con
demn such a proceeding. The First Con
gregational is one of the most aristocratic
churches here and the feeling aroused is
intense. If the institutional plan is
adopted it will result in the indignant
withdrawal of many leading members.
SAN JOSE DAMAGE SUITS.
Two Men Who Called A'ame* Go to the
Courts for Redress.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 20.â M. 8. Jaffe,
formerly of this city, but now a liquor
dealer of Stockton, has filed an answer and
cross-complaint to the $5000 damage suit
brought against him by H. Brosius. In
the cross-complaint Jaffe asK3 for $10,000
damages against Brosius. He claims that
his reputation was injured to that extent
by the following words, which, he asserts,
were used by Brosius :
"You are a thief. You rob people. You
sell gin that you fix up and call it Hol
land gin. You sell your goods as eenuine;
they are all doctored and will poison any
one who drinks them."
Several months ago Jaffe and Brosius
bad a dispute over a bill, and in the row
that followed Brosius claims Jaffe accused
him of being a green-poods man. A suit
for $5000 damages by Brosius at once fol
lowed, the claim setting forth that Jaffe
had used these words: ''You are a scoun
drel and a swindler. You are a green
goods man. You buy and sell green
goods and you swindle and rob people
with them."
In his answer, filed yesterday, the de
fendant denies that he used such language.
DINNER FOR THE POOR.
Bounteous Bepast to Be Followed hy a

SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec 19.â The Ameri
can Volunteers are preparing a magnifi
cent feast for the poor of this city on

RABBI NIETO
AT PALO ALTO
Talks to Students in the
Stanford University-
Chapel.
"Universal Charity" the Theme
of a Pica to Men of All
Creeds.
Welcomes the Growth of a Spirit of
To erance in the Churches of
Tc-Day.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Dec.
20.â At the invitation of the faculty of
Stanford University Rabbi Jacob Nieto
addressed the students this morning. He
took as the subject of his address "Uni
versal Charity." The following is a synop
sis of his remarks:
This world of ours, old as it is, has never
witnessed the realization of its ideals, nor ex
perienced the consummation of its hope in an
ideal. To assume thÂ« contrary would stig;ma
ti ze our efforts, feeble our thoughts, unprogres
sive, our ambitions definable, our aspirations
limited; in short to human thought as a stag
nant pool, a veritable quagmire of decaying
and decayed brain matter. But humanity is
a vast ocean of life in which myriads of strut
gling organisms are constantly germinating
and reproducing newer and better, ideas.
Growth, continuous and never ending is the
law of this universe, and that which is true
of the universe at large is true of man or any
portion or function of his organism. Even as
from the clashing ol the waves of ocean new
forms of life are produced, so from out the
conflict of human emotions there emerge at
all times pure and hallowed thoughts destined
lor eternal life through the new ideals born ol
them.
The color and texture of the petals of a
flower greatly depend upon tho nature of the
soil that nourishes the tree and upon climatic
environment. So the quality of man's
thoughtsâ the flowers of his intellectâ are reg
ulated in a great measure by tile nature ot his
education and his environment. I say, In a
great measure, for even as you cannot make
the rose tree bear corn so is it impossible to
expect a brain to accomplish work that its
structure does not permit. By all means
known to him the gardener strives to produce
a perfect flower, the Btockralser a perfect,
horse and idealists have sought efficient and
effective means to produce a periect human
being. But the experience ot the horse
breeder has demonstrated that there has been
always room for improvement in the best spe
cimens that he has obtained. The experience
of man has shown that the human mind has
never yet conceived an ideal Dut that it has
occurred that after man has begun to arrange
the actions ol his life in conformity to the
iaeal a yd further and more perfectly devel
oped form ol bis ideal has arisen.
The ideal ol "Universal Charity," like all
other ideals, was in its germ state rudimentary
in outline and form, its moving power feeble,
its awakening force weak. Egoistic in its
first inception, following the rule oi universal
law it became at length altruistic. Starting
in the hopes and desires of the individual, it
became quickly National and then by the
gradual processes of development, universal.
Offspring ot emotions ana sentiments the
reverse of itself, like all germs it was forced
to struegie for existence dependent upon that
strength which it had derived from its parent
thoughts. Liberty in iU embryo state is the
offspring of two desiresâ freedom from
oppression and vengeance on the oppressor.
No sooner has the yoke been thrown off, how
ever, than that desire receives a new and
hallowed impetus. Tbe dreams of retaliation
which in tbe cold darkness of despair seemed
bright and warm, become despicable and
loathsome, and the justice of taking vengeance
upon the enemy darkens into a lurid picture
of barbaric cruelty. Inhuman conduct has
been the germ of all humane laws and cher
ished plans of contemplated revenge have
melted into ethical principles. The odious
ness of repaying their oppressors In kind has
impressed itself upon the minds of liberated
peoples, and souls that hungered for revenge
yearned to share their heavenly lot with lesÃ
favored races. Convinced by comparison of
the contradictoriness of their vicious intent
and the lofty principles they had striven to
vindicate, they had transformed themselves
from demons of revenge into angels of mercy.
That the world to-day cherishes this, the" lof
tiest and noblest of Ideals, ii the greatest as
surance oi the growth of intelligence that ex
ists. All other ideals are comprised in it and
the practice of the virtues necessary to its
operation. It is a religion in itself
and of itself, being the substance of
all religions and ethical teaching taken
together. Tolerant of all and oppress
ing none, Justice to all without envy or
hate, one law, one God. Tbe martial tread oi
tbe armored soldiers of the medieval church
may, through the terror of their warlike ap
pearance, have forced upon a people creeds
that were odious. The bristling front of
equipped armies may have compelled the ac
ceptance of comfortless dogmas, but the pious
and gentler aspect of "universal charity" at
tracts while it strengthens and infuses hope
and courage into despondent hearts.
The history of the development of human
thought and conduct â of the growth of ideals â
the thoughtful student may readily discover
in tbe Bible. Unfortunately for humanity at
large nearly all the sects that have adopted
the Bible as the basis of their religious and
moral teachings have considered a collection
of books more sacred than human life and
happiness. Their Insistence upon the unal
terability of its enactions have tended to de
feat the end for which they asbert man was
created. Man has been asked to unreservedly
accept all the statements contained therein as
trutb for all time, and to guide bis actions
under the altered conditions of to-day by the
law of 4000 years ago. By this action they
have defined and limited the wisdom and
power of the Infinite and held In bondage hu
man minds. Judaism accepts no such lim
itation. Tbe scope of the operation of any
law must be regulated In accordance with the
requlremenU of the age. To use the words of
the Talmud, "Everything according to the
needs of tbe times."
In the minds of those rough and ready
philosophers, "Man created in the image of
God whose wisdom lias no limit must neces
sarily as to his mind resemble bis maker."
He muit be possessed of an elasticity of
thought, a power lor comprehending all
things. Even as in the progress of bis bodily
growth his form changes, so in the expansion
of his mind must bis thoughts undergo a
change.
Tolerance of adverse opinions or conflicting
religious ideas betokens a state of magnani
mity bardly to be expected ol the early
centuries of the present era. How much the
less would we expect ideal tolerance of men
who lived over 2000 years ago. Yet, this
growth of the spirit of tolerance is to be found
in the Bible. Jehovah, the God of Abraham
the individual, becomes through Moses the
God of Israel the nation, and through the
breadth of mind of the second Isuiah the God
of all the earthâ the universal God. The father
and protector of Adam becomes the father of
the first-born Israel, aud through Malachi the
faihcr of all mankind.
All children do not adopt the same mode of
greeting their parents, and so men should be
permitted to approach their father in heaven
as their natures prompted them.
SANIA BARBARA SUICIDE
Merchant John Krieg Fires a Bullet Into
Hit Brain.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Dec. 20.â
John Krieg, a merchant of this city, com
mitted suicide this morning. He arose
early, telling his wife that he was going
for a walk. Later he was seen strolling
along the wharf. When some distance
from shore he went to the edge and placed
a pistol to his head. The echo of the shot
and the splash of the body in the water
told the result. Life being extinct when
the body fell, it floated and was towed
ashore. The Coroner was notified and an
inquest held, the jury returning a verdict
of suicide. Krieg leaves a widow and two
children. Ho was a German by birth, and
50 years old.

TUGGERS ON THE ROPE.
Another Say Spent by Men Palling
Against Each Other for a Prize.
Yesterday, less than a week from Christ
mas, was an ideal day. Tbe sun shone
with all the warmth and splendor that it
does in midsummer. Thousands took ad
vantage of the opportunity to visit the
Park, the Cliff and vicinity.
The tug-of-war was the great attraction
in Sutro Baths, and within the big build
ing there were thousands who had assem
bled to see the strong men struggle against
each other for tne prize offered.
There was some little dissatisfaction at
the outset because the poolbox bad been
closed. It was decided to keep it closed
and the men were informed that the tug
must ba decided on merit alone.
The first tug of the afternoon was be
tween Ireland and Canada. The men,
after several jiays' recuperation, were full
of vigor and mounted the platform with
a determination to hold oui against each
other. The Canadians pulled with all the
strength at their command, but at first
they failed to make any impression on
the indicator. After a brief rest they
gave one strong tug and succeeded in
hauling the Irish team over one cleat, and
despite the efforts of the men from Ire
land they were hauled along until eight
cleats had been gained. There was an
other tug and tbe indicator shot past the
mark, the Canadians winning in four
minutes and thirty-rive seconds. Up to
that time Canada had won a tug from
Portugal, Slavonia, Italy, Germany and
Ireland and had a tie with Denmark.
The next to measure their lengths on
the platform were Italy and Germany. At
the word "go" each side tUKged to move
the indicator and each side made a good
showing, but neither gained a cleat for
more than a minute. Germany gained
one oleat and by sheer strength Italy re
gained it, but did not hold it long, lor the
Germans got an advantage and held it
uninterruptedly until they pulled the in
dicator over the winning line, winning in
three minutes and five seconds. This
gives the victory to Germany over SlaVo
nia and Italy, having been defeated by
Sweden, America, Ireland and Canada.
Sweden and Dedmark then went at it,
Sweden gaining a point at the first tug
and holding it for two minutes. One of
the men from Denmark lost his footing
and Sweden taking advantage of this
tugged strongly and at the end of three
minutes and thirty seconds they had
pulled their opponents over the line. The
tug placed Sweden the winner from Ger
many, Italy, Ireland, Slavonia, Portugal
and Denmark, without having met a de
feat during the tournament up to that
time.
The next to appear were the teams
representing the United States and Portu
gal. This was a stubbornly contested tug,
and while the United States' won in six
minutes they did not have a walkover for
they gained it only cleat by cleat with a
rest between each cleat. This placed
America as the winner of a tug from Italy,
Norway, Germany, Denmark, Slavonic
and Portugal without a defeat.
The last pull for the day was between
Norway and Slavonic. Tnis proved to be
the best puU of ihe day. The team for
Slavonia. lighter than the one from Nor
way, gained three cleats, and for some
time it was lose and gain one cleat at a
time, but suddenly Norway got in eight
cleats in one tug and after a rest carried
their opponents over the line in five min
utes and fifty-one seconds, the work being
loudly applauded. This makes Norway
the winner of a tug from Portugal and
Slavonia and with a tie with Italy.
There will De another tug on Sunday
next.
There will not be any ceremony in the
matter of unveiling the Grant monument
in Golden Gate Park, as the sheet was
taken off the long-hid bust by order of
Superintendent McLaren one evening last
week. The monument was tendered by a
committee of citizens to the Park Com
missioners, the Commissioners accepted it
and that was the end of it. Now that the
shroud has been removed the bust of the
illustrious defender of his country is ex
posed to view. The comments of the
people who gave it either a critical or
passing glance was that "it is not much
of a bust, anyhow." There have been
others, but few that do lees credit to the
man whose memory it is intended to
honor.
Since the reopening of the museum in
the park the average attendance has been
1200 a day. The officials of the museum at
this time are engaged in placing distinct
and legible labels on all the exhibits. The
employes of the museum are now attired
in dark-blue uniforms and each wears a
special's star.

Dr. Joseph Rodes of San
Diego Drowned at
La Jolla.
Goes Fishing in a Frail Craft
and Encounters Heavy
Seas.
Rescued Once, but Perishes While
Attempting to Right His
Boat.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 20.â An awful
death overtook Dr. Joseph Rodes this
morning at La Jolla. Dr. Rodes was one
of the leading physicians of the city, al
though only 33 years of age, and, through
his wealth and high family connections,
was quite prominent here and in Phila
delphia, hia native city. He had a cot
tage at La Jolla, and was spending ths
Sabbath there with his family, consisting
of his wife, two children and his brother
in-law, John Keenan.
Eodes and Keenan vent tishing this
morning in a rowboat on the calm ocean,
not far from the landing place. When
they attempted to return at 11 o'clock
they found the breakers very high and
threatening to swamp their boat. They
passed through one or two lines of comb
ers without accident, and seemed to be
out of dancer when a very large wave
arose and filled the boat, capsizing it. Dr.
Rodes 1 feet were tangled in the fishing
lineÃ, but he succeeded in reaching the
upturned boat with Keenan, and they
were picked up by two other fishermen,
W. E. Gouldman and Bob Stewart.
After all were in the boat Dr. Rodes
insisted upon trying to right his boat.
While they were attempting this another
great breaker dashed upon the four men
and threw them out, turning the boat
over and over. Dr. Rodes' boat was
lifted and brought down with a crash, one
end striking his forehead and fracturing
his skulL He succeeded in swimming a
few feet, but fainted, and Keenan, seeing
his condition, swam to his assistance and
held him above water.
The three men were in a dangerous po
sition, the breakers piling water over their
heads and almost strangling them. Kee
nan is an expert swimmer and quite ath
letic He contrived to reach the capsized
boat after herculean labor and clung to it,
holding Rodes' head uniil help came from
shore. Gouldman, one of the rescuing
party, was overcome by the waves: and
almost drowned. He bad only an oar to
cling to, but one of the others, after reach
ing the boat, flung a rope to him by which
he saved himself.
Dr. Rodes' wound on the head was the
immediate cause of his death. Keenan,
holding him up, noticed that he grew
deathly pale and before the rescuers came
he found that Rodes was dead. The
rescuers, John Kennedy and C. S. Dear
born, reached the party twenty minutes
after the accident and all was almost on
the point of giving up from exhaustion.
Mrs. Rodes was in the cottage overlook
ing the little cove where her husband met
his death. She was spared the agony of
witnessing the accident, however, and
while waiting for uer husband to return
was made acquainted with the news.
A special car was sent out to La Jolla
this afternoon and the body was brought
to the city. An inquest will be held to
morrow morning.
Dr. Rodes was quite wealthy, having a
fine home at Fourth and A streets.

IN A PATENT SUIT
Three-Cornered Claims to a
Photographic In
vention.
Marceau Alleged to Hive Se
cured a Patent by Illegal
Means.
George A. Meyer Asserts He Is the
Real Inventor of a Certain
Eas-Reiief Process.
A rather unexpected and sensational
turn has been given to the suit tiled by I.
W. Taber against Theodore G. Marceau in
the United States Circuit Court lor alleged
infringement of a patent in connection
with the making of bas-relief photographs.
This suit was instituted about three
months ego, but the main issues have
never been before the court. E. F. Mur
dock and J. H. Miller are attorneys for
GEORGE A. MEYER, Who Claims the Invention of an
Important Photographic Process.
' complainant and John L. Boone is the
legal representative of the defendant.
One of the must stringent rules in con
nection with the granting of patents is
. that requiring the applicant for the patent
to be the actual inventor. The complain
ant in this suit now claims to have made
the discovery that Marceau, in whose
name the alleged infringing patent stands,
is not the real inventor, and that there
fore his patent is void and that he has
been guilty of forgery. The attorneys for
Taber even go further, and declare that
the real inventor is George A. Meyer, at
present in the employ of Marceau.
In support of their claims they will pro
duce a sworn statement from Meyer in
which the latter claims that the Marceau
patent was obtained on the invention
which he submitted to his employer, and
. that be allowed his rights to be interfered
with because he did not at the time real
ize the value of his invention.
Meyer's sworn statement is as follows:
The way 1 first learned of bas relief photo
graphing is as follows: I was at Strong's and
Mr. Marceau came there to get Strong to de
vise some method or process by which to make
photographs in relief. Strong tried for quite
a while, but was unsuccessful. Strong is a
member of the firm of Bolton & Strong, photo
engravers.
I bad my wife make a blue print from a
negative at noun. I made a plaster of Paris
slab that night, engraved the slab and em
' bossed the photograph that same night. My
' first attempt was successful. The next morn
ing I took it down to the shop and showed it
to three or four of the boys. At noontime I
telephoned to Marceau inquiring if he would
. like to see me in regard to raised photographs.
I went that night to see Marceau, but I did not
have the photograph with me. I simply spoke
of it to him. and he told me to bring the pho
tograph around to him the following day, and
{n accordance with this request I brought him
the embossed blue print the next day. He
appeared ver7 glad to see it and said it was
the very thing he was looking for. He gave
me a negative, so as to see if I could make a
bas relief from one of his own negatives. I
returned him the completed embossed photo
* graph the next day.
Then for two or three days we were fussing
'over â what to do and what he was to give
me. We finally decided that I was to work for
him for a salary. When I was there two or
â¢three weeks he made me sign a paper. 1
signed the paper and continued to work for
him. The paper, as far as I read and under
stood it, was that I was to worK for so much a
week to perfect an invention of Theodore C.
Marceau.
Marceau did not have an invention of this
kind to my knowledge, although he had had
others working for him to make this for him,
which I learned after I was there. I was in
his employ a short time when -he spoke about
our getting out a patent on this particular in
vention. He spoke in such a way that I
thought he was going to do something for me
in that way. He always said we were going to
get out a patent, and I thought he was going
to benefit me. I did not know when he filed
the application for the patent. The only time
he spoke to me definitely about the patent
was when he showed me a telegram that the
patent had been issued to him.
. I have always considered this my own In
vention. 1 was told so by every one who saw
me do it. My invention consists of mak
ing plaster of Paris slab and cutting out
the outline of the photograph on a print and
putting it on the piaster of Paris cast and en
graving from that, then registering and em
bossing it. â¢ .
I always considered myself the first in
ventor of this particular process, and I gave
Mr. Marceau no authority to procure a patent
in Marceau's name. 1 did not know that Mr.
Marceau had procured a patent until Mr. Mar
feau showed me a telegram announcing the
fact that the patent was allowed. It was three
months after I was there before he spoke con
fidentially of us getting a patent. At the time
that Mr. Marceau showed me the telegram an
nouncing the granting of the patent I did not
then make any move asserting my rights for
the reason that I was upder the impression
'that I could do nothing against the -patent
that had been granted to him. I did not know
to the contrary until within the last few days.
Mr. Meyer is a dentist by profession,
and when called upon was quite diffident
in speaking of the subject of his inven
tion. .He explained his silence hitherto
by confessing that he was co much ab- \
sorbed in his dentistry work that he I
thought little of ibe value of his photo
graphic bas-relief invention at i lie time.
Jle stated that he had beard that Marceau
was trying to secure sucn an invention in
order to compete with the Taber gallery,
and he set about experimenting with ma
terial which he was accustomed to handle
in connection with his profession. He ,
soon hit upon a successful process, and
the remainder of the story is best told in
the preceding sworn statement.
Meyer has been in the employ of Mar
ceau ever Â«ince Marceau adopted his
method. His attention was entirely
given to the manufacture of bas-relief
photographs by the method which he
I claims to have invented. In view, how
eve:, of the turn which matters have now
taken Meyer will probably not aeain set
foot in the Marceau gallery.

b'ing "masterly." The young lawyer elo
quently urged upon the boys to form
ha' its of temperance, and form self-control
now in the days of their youth, which is
the molding time of character. He
warned them of the strong temptations to
come, and arduous duties to be perform U
in their approacning manhood, and
pointed out the need of preparation to
meet them wnile the mind and heart are
young and plastic He explained to them
that one of the great benehts of the league
was that in friendly association they could ;
encourage each other to lead lives of
virtue. The company a boy keeps has a
powerful influence in determining whether
his manhood will be good or evil.
The assistance given to the musical part
of the entertainment by Miss McAleer and
Brother Hosea as accompanists was much
appreciated.
Last of all, a row of little boys stood in
line and, holding their right hands up,
solemnly nledsred themselves to total
abstinence till 21 years of age.

An extraordinary general meeting of the

corner of Post and Taylor streets. There
was a full attendance of the congregation
and of the committees.
After the attention of those present had

the principal affair of the day was pro

the question of the election of a rabbi and

The Italian Philharmonic Society received an ovation at the New Bush
street Theater last evening. The occasion was the singing by that aggregation
of local artists of Donizetti's masterpiece, "Poliuto." Th* rendition was an
artistic success, and the theater was packed with enthusiastic lovers of music.
The leading parts were taken by Miss M. Coleman, soprano, as Paolina; L.
Giorgi, tenor, as Poliuto; L. Delucca, tenor, as Felix; C. Z:ipelli, barytone, as
Senerus; C. Vitaline, basso, as Cailisthenes; D. Valerga, tenor, as Marco, and
A. Biagi, tenor, as A Chrit iau.
Much of the success of the production was due to the unusually strong
and well-trained chorus.
This comprised Misses L. Spadina, alto; T. Casassa, alto; A. Spadina,
alto; T. Need ham, alio: D. Lombardi, J. Murphy, J. Lenormand, T. Guinasso,
E. Montrichard, M. Cronin, K. Talbot. 1. Talbot, I. Butlach, M. Buckley and

chini, 8. Lazzarini, C. Maccono, A. Petri, G. Rigassi, F. Scatena, A. Alborelli,
A. Daniele. C. Albossio.
The action of the opera, which is described as a melodrama in three acts,
takes place at Militene, capital of Armenia, in the third century, durins the
reign of the Roman Emperor Decius. The plot deal 3 with the persecution of
the early Christians, and the leading parts in their interpretation called for
considerable histrionic talent. In this the ladies and gentlemen singing the
parts were not found wanting.
Professor A. Spadina acted as musical director and Signor D. Valerga was
stage manager.
Jacob Nieto be elected for a period of three
years at an increased salary. This is the
longest time that the committee is em
powered to elect a rabbi under the consti
tution of the synagogue. A deputation of
trustees waited upon the reverend gentle
man during the atternoon for the purpose
of acquainting him of his re-election.
Louis Brown, the president of the congre
gation, voiced the decision of the members
of Sherith Israel in p few eracefnl words,
in which he took occasion to speak in flat
tering terms of Dr. Nieto's sprvices during
the time in which he has acted as the pas
tor of the congregation.
Rev. D. S. Davis, the cantor, was also re
elected at an increased salary for three
years.

SAY THEY CAN
MAKE RATES
The Attorney-General's De
murrer Is a Fighting
Document
Railroad Commissioners Said to
Have a Right to Make
Rates.
The Rate-Making Power Legislative
and Not Subj ct to Revision
by a Court
Attorney-General Fitzgerald's demur
rer in the famous Railway Commission
ers case, now pending in the United States
Circuit Court, was the one theme of con
versation in legal circles yesterday.
It is now generally conceded that the
move will greatly delay the main issue
and give the Commissioners a slight ad
vantage.
Another feature of the case of consider
able interest is that it forces .ludpe Mc-
Konna to go over the entire matter again
and pass with even more care than before
on a number of intricate matters.
"There is one feature of the case," said
Attorney J. B. Randolph yesterday,
"which ought to be thoroughly exploited.
It is comprised in objection C of para
graph 5, and is as follows: 'Because it is
in violation and contravention of the
rules and principles of the common law,
in relation to restraints of trade and in re
lation to monopolies.' The question as
to the extent of the common law rule is
one of preat importance and ought to be
thoroughly ventilated now."
Speaking of the case yesterday, Attorney-
General Fitzgerald said:
"I do not attach great importance to
the filing of this demurrer, for it has
long been contemplated. It introduces
no new procedure and no great
surprise, but has come up in due
course of business and will be disposed of
as it is reached. Of course it involves
many of the vital issues of the entire
case," and if we win the whole matter is
practically settled."
Great stress wiil be laid on the point
that the acts of the hoard have been and
are essentially legislative in character and
not subject to the revision or review of
any court. It is said that this point will
be argued at creat length.
The entire effect of the demurrer will be
to cause a closer analysis than has yet
been eiven to the question of the powers
and functions of the board. The argu
ment promises to be exhaustive and far
reaching.
It is understood that the Commissioners
feel sure that a more extensive investiga
tion of the case will result in a decision in
their tavor. They say there is abundant
precedent for the position that their func
tions are wholly legislative and not aub
ject to amendment or revision.

THE CALL SPEAKS for ALL.
Pick your presents promptly.
Rush the Christmas shopping.
There is always some fun in a crush.
Keep your eyes open for Californu
novelties.
The Senate will to-day recognize Cuba
enough to talk about her at any rate.
The Senators would just as soon have a
war with Spain as not. They are too old
to fight.
Make your purchases during the day if
you can and leave the evenings for those
who caD't.
Do your shopping pronmtly and make
way forothers. That is the politeness of
the season.
The Christmas Call will appear on
Christmas day, but this is the day to leave
orders for it.
To-day the hearings begin as to the
relative merits of the San Pedro enter
prise and the Santa Monica job.
Don't postpone your holiday purchas
ing until Christmas eve. You will need
tbat day for rest and recreation.
There is one thing commendable about
the attitude assumed by Senator Hill. It
is clearly that of a man who doesn't in
tend to stand in anbody's way.
The universality of the popular demand
that our Government recognize the inde-
pendence of Cuba seems a clear proof that
the people have already recognized it.
A number of Eastern papers have been
accused of nominating their pet enemies
for Cabinet positions just for the purpose
of seeing other papars jump on them and
macerate them.
If the Central Pacific Company had
ever intended to pay it 1 ? dues to the Gov
ernment it would have arranged to do so
before this. Tbe funding scheme is a
fraudulent fake.
The battle is over nnd the noise of the
combat has been lost in the hum of reviv
ing industry, but lo! Boise of lowa has
arisen with a warwboop for fiat money.
Shall we never have peace?
There is no land in the world where the
joy of the Christmas season will be so
universally diffused among the people as
in California, but for all that there will be
a need of charity here as well as elsewhere.
It required five and a half months to
pass the McKinley tariff and upward of
eight months to pass the Wilson tariff, so
the extra session will have a chance to
make a record on speedy work in tariff
making.
The decision of Congress to take up the
funding bill tbe first thing after the holi
days means, of course, that there will be
no holidays for the monopoly workers. If
they know how to make hay at all they
will make it now.
If tbe advocates of good roads are any
where near correct in estimating that the
people of the united States lose over $200,
-000,000 a year on bad roads It would pay
to go over the highways carefully just to
pick up the money.
As if there were not problems enough in
life to make it perplexing to the verge of
confusion, tbe Chicago Record has sprung
a new one by asking, "Why is it that nine
tenths of women in public life are more
than thirty-six inches around the waist"?
According to the report of the New York
Board of Health there were 1125 deaths
from sunstroke in that State during the
month of August, and it appears, there
fore, that the summer season in the East
sets in with even more severity than the
blizzard period.
The vehemence with which the gold
standard papers in the East are denounc
ing the Republican Senators for appoint
ing a committee to devise legislation
to promote bimetallism shows that they
understand the movement is in earnest
and means success. There is no doubt
anywhere that the Republican party will
keep its pledge.
President Harper of Chicago University
innocently said in public the otber day
that the experiment of leaving it optional
with students to attend religious service
had not been successful in that institution,
and now nearly all the wise men in the
country are informing him the failure was
due to the fact that the experiment was
tried in Chicago.
Captain-General Weyler, Governor and
Commander-in-Chief of Cuba, is not hav
ing a pleasant life by any means. la ad
dition to the anxieties of* bis office he has
tbe further grief of knowing that his wife
is lying dangerously ill at Barcelona and
his eldest son is in the last stages of con
sumption. He has every reason in the
world for desiring to bo home, and no
doubt the desire is with him continually.
Many people in the East who have be
lieved that Japanese competition is a hum
bug have been led to take a sober second
\ thought of tbe subject by the failure of a
large manufacturing company of Milford,
Coon., whose trade has been destroyed by
cheap Japanese straw mattings. To make
tbe matters worse tbe company is consid
ering the advisability of sending their
plant to Japan and carrying on the busi
ness in that country.
CHRISTMAS TRADING.
From now until Thursday we shall have
in our stores and shops the crush of the
Christmas trade. Almost every place in
which articles suitable for holiday gifts
are sold will be thronged with people from
early in the forenoon until as late at night
as the shops are open. It is therefore im
portant that all should be reminded to do
their shopping as speedily as possible, so
as to avoid putting others to inconven
ience, discomfort and loss.
All who can find the time should do
their trading during the day, so as to
leave the stores in the evening free for
those who are engaged in work all day
and have no time to make their Christ
mas purchases until working hours are
over. If those who have leisure in the
day time will observe this rule, they will
show a genuine Christmas thoughtfulness
toward their less fortunate neighbors.
They will give the working men and
women of the City a fair chance to do
their shopping with comfort, and thus
enable them to fina more pleasure in it
than would be the case if the stores were
overcrowded.
We have so frequently during the past
month urged our people to purchase Cali
fornia novelties and dainties for Christmas
gifts that it will seem to many like a
wearisome insistence if we repeat it
again. Nevertheless, this is counsel of a
nature which can never be reiterated too
often. IS we are to make California a
manufacturing State, we must patronize
the products of its factories. It is Irom
small beginnings that great things grow.
Almost all the vast manufactories of the
United States were begun on a small
scale, and at first involved very little more
than hand labor. W r e have a number of
these small factories among us now, and
if we give them proper support tnere can
be no question they will grow into great
establishments, whose products will find
favor, markets and profits in all parts of
the world.
If you do not know what articles you
wisa to buy for Christmas, or, if knowing
the article, you do not know where to ob
tain it, read our advertising columns.
The Call is recognized by our merchants
to be the newspaper of the homes of San
Francisco, and they advertise in it all ar
ticles needed for the home. By a little
study of these advertisements you will be
able to find what you wish and know ex
actly where to get it. This will enable
you to do your shopping with compara
tive ease and freedom. You will be saved
from t-he weariness and the trouble of the
crush and the crowds that throng the
stores from now until Christmas day, and
yet will make as good bargains as any
who spend whole days in the work ol
shopping.
These tlien are the rules to follow: Do
your trading early; purchase Calitornian
goods where suitable to your needs, and
read The Call advertisements in order
that you may know where to obtain any
thing you wish in tbe best quality and at
the lowest price. Follow tiieÂ«-e and you
will not only fiud Christmas shopuing a
pleasure to j'ourself but you will help to
make it pleasant to others.
INTERSTATE COMMERCE
That questions of interstate commerce
will occupy a large part of the attention
of Congress this winter is made evident
by the importance given them in the
messages of President Cleveland and
Attorney-G3neral Harmon and by the
proceedings of the Senate committee
wn cii is intrusted with the subject. The
workings of tbe Interstate Commerce
Commis>ion under the present law is
certainly unsatisfactory, and it devolves
upon Congress to determine what is
needed to remedy the eviL
A report of the commission itself points
out to Congress that the general discon
tent with present transportation con
ditions is shown by petitions from many
sections of the country for the enforce
ment of the statutes. The repoit con
firms the opinion of the Attorney-General
that the law is defective, and recommends
amending it so as to give greater force and
finality to the findings and decisions of
the commission in cases that come be
fore it
There are some, however, who believe
the failure of the law is due to a Inck of
energy on the part of the Government.
At a session of tfoe Senate committee on
Thursday Senator Chandler is reported
to have insisted that the Department of
Justice has not pressed tbe law with suf
ficient vigor. Mr. Chandler stated the
Attorney-General himself haa said the
pooling agreement of certain roads was
legal, and, when some doubt was ez
pressed by other Senators, Mr. Chandler
produced a letter in which the Attorney-
General gave an opinion that in an im
portant case he had no doubt the pooling
agreement was drawn wit .in the points
covered by Judge Symington in the trans-
Missouri case.
A curious obstacle in tho wav of
enforcing the anti-trust and anti-pooling
laws was stated by Mr. McFarlane,
Assistant District Attorney of New York,
who told the Senate committee that
considerable difficulty was encountered in
findin: Judges who were not disqualified
from trying such cases by reason of
holding stock in some of the various
companies who were parties to tbe suits.
It is reported that this statement "seemed
to surprise the committee," and that a
discussion followed as ta whether the
Supreme Court Judee3 themselves were
not disqualified to try tbe case in question
when it came before them.
Taken altogether the whole interstate
commerce regulation and the anti-trust
laws seem to be in a condition of "con
fusion worse confounded." It is not clear
whether the blame for failure in the en
forcement of the acts to prevent trusts
and pools is due to the Attorney-General,
to Congress, to the courts, to the Inter
state Commerce Commission or to the
law. The only thing certain is that
something is wrong, and that being so it
devolves upon Congress to find out the
cause of the evil and apply the remedy as
promptly as possible.
PROGRESS IN IRELAND.
The Irish Land Commission, which was
broueht into bein- by the Gladstone act
of 1881 for the purpose of deciding what
was equitab'e between tenant and land
lord, has by later enactment been endowed
with powers to loan money to tenants
to the end that they might become own
ers of small land holdings. The report
of the commissioners for the last fiscal
year shows there were 1502 applications
for advances for this purpose aggregating
$2,501,375, of which 1461, amounting to
$2,271,280, were granted. The whole
amount of cash loans maae by the com
mission since its creation has been $51,
-065,000. The total amount repaid by the
purchasing tenants up to this time is
$2,945,000, and they have paid $8,897,400
interest.
This reveals the rate at which former
tenants are becoming proprietors. The
figures of the report become remarkable
when they tell of the small proportion of
borrowers who have failed to pay up their
obligations. Last fall when the install- j
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, MOiN'DAY, DECEMBER 21, 189 G.
ments were due from 5202 purchasers,
only 61 failed to come up with the money.
The friends of Government aid to land
purchasers find in this a justification for
past advocacy, and are encouraged to fur
ther efforts for the extension of facilities
for the toilers to become owners of the
land they till. It is estimated that under
tbe operation of the new land act prob
ably five times as much money can be ad
vanced to borrowers, and there is little
doubt there will be plenty of industrious,
capaD'.e and ambitious tenants who will
seize the opportuniiy to possess homes.
The other work of the Land Commis
sion in the fixation of what is rightful
rent has been very important also. They
passed judgment on $31,500,000 cf rents
charged, and reduced them a little over
20 per cent, thus saving to the tenants
$6,500,000. The reductions make it clear
that tbe Irish have been oppressed by
their landlords, and that the Irish Land
League had good reason for its birth in
the great neea of reform.
There is also encouragement in the
prospect of the appointment of a Minister
of Agriculture and Industry for Ireland,
who will have power to draw funds from
the imperial exchequer for the develop
ment of the resources of the island. A
non-partisan committee appointed by|Par
liament has been investigating the agri
cultural and industrial conditions of the
country, and a movement is on foot to
have such an office created to carry out
the suggestions of the committee.
By careful estimates the investigating
committee nas reached the conclusion
that the Irish crops and livestock might
be doubled in value by improved methods
of farming. As an example of the ways
in which the new office would work for
improvement, the practice of Belgium and
Holland is recommended, where they
have trained instructors to enlighten the
farmers as to the best means of conduct
ing their industries. The farmers on the
Continent produce crops of potatoes seven
fold as great per acre as those of the
Irish. It is believed that with proper at
tention the small Jarrners of Ireland can
secure for themselves a good portion of
the one hundred millions per annum
which England sends to the Continent for
the products of dairy and poultry yards.
A GIFT TO LOS ANGELES.
Los Angeles is not only plucky but
lucky. Her citizens are not only enter
prising but generous. Her people not
only do much for themselves but lor one
another. She not oniy advances her wel
fare with diligence and public spirit, but
she is the recipient of favors which ad
vance it still further.
Her latest good fortune 13 the gift of
3000 acres of land in one body lying a little
more than a mile from the city line, in
cluding in its scope what is described as
"a beautiful combination of bills and
lovely dale? with magnificent prospects
and poetic retreats." The description
does not seem to be exaggerated, for the
land lies portly on the frostless foothills
bordering the Cahuenga Valley and partly
in tbe level stretches of the Los Angelej
river bottom.
The gift will be the more gratefully re
ceived by the people of Los Angeles on
account of the gracious and graceful way
in which it was made. Tne donor. Mr. G.
J. Gr:nith, says in h:s offer of the gift :
in the course of twenty-three years' active
business life in California I have become
proudly attached to our beautiful city of Los
Angeles, wbich, through itj great nature! ad
vantages and itd matchless climate, hveracing
300 sunny days in the year, is destined to soon
become a great metropolis. The arduous work
ot these years has been rewarded with fair
success, and, recognizing the duty which one
who has acquired some little wealth owes to
the community in which he has prospered, and
desiring to aid the advancement and happi
ness of the city that has been lor so long aud
always will be my home. I am impelled to
make an offer, the acceptance of which by
yourselves, acting for the people, I believe
will be a source of enjoyment and pride to my
fellows and add a charm to our beloved city.
It will be seen these words carry to Los
Angeles a compliment ns well as a gift.
Tuey will reca 1 to tier people the con
sciousness of their possession of an
elysian climate, a public spirit of great
civic patriotism and a determination to
make their city a metropolis for busiues
and a paradise for pleasure-seekers. For
a gift so charmingly given there can
hardly fail to be the most profuse and
sincere thankfulness. Los Angeies has
now a park of which she cau ba proud,
and, moreover, another reason for boast
ing of the merits of her citizens as well as
of the delights of her soil, scenery and
sunshine.
NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
H. M. S. Virago, torpedo-boat destroyer of
370 tons, made a successful trial in November
last, making a mean speed during three hours
of 30.05 knots and developing G425 horse
power, or 425 in excess of the contract, she
was built and engined by Laird Brothers, Bir
kenhead.
The two Japanese cruisers to be built by
Cramps and the Union Iron Works are, ac
cording to the London Times, to be of 4760
tons displdcemen , 405 feet 2 inches length
over all, 396 leet lensrih on water line, 49 feet
beam and 17 feet 7 inches mean draught.
Their armament will consist of two 8-inch
rifles, ten 4.7-inch rapid firers, twelve 12
-pounders, two 6 and two 2^-pounders, and
they will have five torpedo tubes. The ma
chinery will be two triple expansion engines
of 15,500 horsepower, four doub!e-?nded and
four single-end boilers carrying 165 pounds of
steam. The stipulated speed is 22% knots, and
the vesbeis are to be completed in two years.
The question of increasing the personnel of
the British navy is engrossing the attention of
the Admiralty, and, of course, Lord Brassey.
The latter recommends an old plan of his
father set forth years ago in British Seamen.
Under it long service in the navy will be
maintained and a strong naval reserve wouid
be formed in this manner: "Ship-owners are
to be encouraged to enter boys, under engage
ment, at the end of their four years' appren
ticeship, to do a year's training in the navy ; a
subsidy of $100 to be paid to the ship-owner
and $75 to the boy, or $50 to the ship-owner
and a like amount to the boy, who would re
turn to the mercantile marine as an A. B. and
be kept efficient as a naval reserveman by one
month's annual drill."
The recent trial of the British cruiser Power
ful was a decided success in all respects. At
the four hours' forced-draught triai she devel
oped 25,886 horsepower and a speed of 21.8
knots. The intended speed was 22 knots, but
Â»s the force of wind was 6 (equal to a pretty
stiff gale) the officials were confident that the
ship under more favorable coudiiions was able
to make 22}$ knots. The boilers, which are of
the Belleville type, worked without a hitch
and carried 257 pounds of steam. As soon as
the forced trial had terminated the ship began
her four hours' trial under natural draught,
during which 22,000 horsepower were easily
maintained. The evolutions were equally sat
isfactory, the engines requiring only eleven to
fifteen seconds in changing from tull-speed ac
tion to full-speed ahead and thirty seconds
from full ahead to stop. Further exhaustive
trials will be carried on with the ship.

He owns the Shaw Hotel and the Butte Ho

TO OPES UP THE
MOTHER LODE
A Great Enterprise for
Amador, Calaveras and
Tuolumne.
Project on Foct to Operate an
Electric Road in These
Counties.
It Will B3 a Feeder for the Sierrt
Pacific to Be Built From
Stockton.
In connection with the Sierra Pacific
Railroad, whicb is to run out of Stockton
into the mining section about forty-five
miles eastward, another great enterprise
is projected, and one tbat will greatly
tend to revolutionize the present situ
ation along the mother lode of Cali
fornia, extending through the counties of
Amador, Calaveras and Tuolumne.
The great factor will be tbe immense
electric-power plant being pat up on the
Mokelumne River by an English syndi
cate represented by Prince PoniatowskL
This will have a capacity sufficient to fur
nish power for all the mines in that lo
cality nnd also for tha latest project con
templatedâthat is, an electric railway
about thirty miles long, to be operated
between Jackson, San Andreas, and along
the mother lode to the north and south
of these towns. The proposed electric
road will be tapped by the Sierra Pacific
Kailroad at a point somewhere between
Jack Eon and San Andreas.
J. W. Hartzell, who has been engaged
to secure a right of way for the electric
line, is now in Ban Francisco on a busi
ness visit. He is most enthusiastic on the
subject. His headquarters are at Jack
son.
"Water power,'' said Mr. Hartzell, "is
now mostly used by the mines, and the
great trouble is that this power has
always b^en controlled by the larger
mines, and the smaller mines and those
in which prospecting was to be done have
not been able to get sufficient power to
properly operate them. This electric
plant of the English syndicate will fur
nish all the power required. Among the
towns that will be greatly benefited by the
new order of things are Jackson, San An
dreas, Amador City, Sutter Creek and, in
fact, all the towus In that section.
"T. S. Buiock is authority for saying
that work will be commenced on the con
struction of the Sierra Pacific from Stock
ton as soon as the rights of way are se
cured from Stockton to the mother lode.
As soon as this work is begun the right of
way for an electric road will b* secured
along the mother lode. Mr. Bullock is
largeiy interesied in both projects.
"One great advantage of these projects
will be thai trains leaving the mother lode
at 1 p. M. will make connection at Stock
ton with the boat leaving there that after
noon for ban Francisco. The California
Navigation and Improvement Company
has agreed to put on a passenger boat to
make the trip between Stockton and San
Francisco in four hours.
â¢ "The building of the electric road will
be very expensive owing to the uneven
character of the counuv it will pass
through. It will probably cost $10,000 a
mile, but it will undoubtedly prove a pay
ing investment as it will give that section
of country an almost direct outlet to tide
water and to San Francisco and make it
possible to handle all tbe products of that
region to much better advantage. It will
also, of course, greatiy stimulate develop
ment of all kinds in the counties through
which the mother lode extends."

LADY'S SKIRT WITH CIRCULAR
FRONT AND CODET BACK.
For making skirt of plaids, checks and
stripes, the shape with a circular front and
godet back is preferred to all others, as it
saves the trouble of matching at the Beams,
for all the seams in this shape are hidden,
falling as they do in between the godet folds,
the front being in one piece. The seams join-
ing it to the back are also hidden in the folds.
Novel effects can be obtained b7 cutting
striped goods with stripes up and down in
front. This brings the stripes bias at the sides
The backs are then cut stripes straight up and
down the center of each godet, or with tne
stripes crosswise. A tall woman will find it
becoming to cut with the stripes going around
the tront.
Materials of checks, plaids or stripes made
after this model look well with waists of plain
material, with sleeves to match the skirt, the
waist made with blouse effect in front, and
full over a fi tted lining in the back.
A jacket waist of plain goods is also stylish,
wearing a blouse to match the skirt.
A Dlaid silk in light colors with black chiffon
bodice makes as handsome a gown as can be
desired.
This skirt pattern is appropriate for making
up any material, and may be worn with any
waist.

Captain Julias Michaelis of the Broid
Gau^e Was Married List
Saturday-
The tug Reliance showed her heels to
the fastest boat in the Spreckels fleet yes
terday, and Captain Gilbert. Brockaw is
jubilant, while Captain John Silovich of
tbe Vigilant, in his usunl straightforward
manner, at once owned up that he was
fairiy and squarely beaten. In the run
from Fort Point to l-'olsorn-street wharf
the Reliance beat the Vigilant by seven
seconds and the Alert by over a minute.
AH three tugs are owned by tbe Spreck
els Tow boat Company.
Early in the month the Reliance was
fitted with one of the W'ttram corrugated
propellers. After a test John D. Spreckels
was so pieasei with the results that he at
once ordered one for the big collier Czar
ina and Henry Peterson gave an order for
one for the Amy. Many and many a time
the Reliance has been beaten by the Vigi
lant, and yesterday was the first time the
tables were turned.
Yesterday morning the Reliance started
to sea with the barkentine Irmgard in
tow and the Vigilant with bark Annie
Johnson, and the Alert with the barken
tine Skagit went out about the same time.
A ter casting off their tows the three tugs
came through the heads together. When
off Fort Point the captain of the Alert
gave the signal and all three went full
speed ahead. Tbe Vigilant had the best
of the start by a second, but before Meiggs
â¢â rharf was reached the Reliance was on
even terms with her. Thence to
Folsom-street wharf the Reliance held the
Vigilant safe and won Handily by six sec
onds. The tables were turned with a ven
geance, but nevertheless Captain Silovich
was the first to go aboard the Reliance
and congratulate Captain Brockaw on the
re.-ult oi the race. While the twocaptains
were talking the Alert came along a min
ute behind time, fche was not disgraced
considering the size of the two boats she
W 18 racing against.
The speed shown by tbe Reliance is all
the more meritorious wben the fact that
her Wittram wheel is only 8 feet in diam
eter and the Vigilant's ordinary wheel
is ll>i feet in diameter is taken into con
bidera.ion.
Tbe gasoline launch Amy, owned by
Henry Peters m, will be fitted with a 36

th > best showing. Tlie boys had a moat
enjoyable outing, nnd in many a spurt
sh owe a that there are not better men to

The gasoline schooner Broad Gauge was

the marriage o: Captain Julius Micbaelis
with MUs Manhu Waltzer. The brides
maids were Miss Annie Waltzer, Miss

with pitch, sank. In a vain attempt to
recover it Danny went overboard, but
managed to clamber back into bis boat
without any difficulty and rowed himself
back to Meiggs wharf.

The Chinese merchants are rxasperated

Garden of EdÂ«n Mythical.
The Rev. vvilliam Kader spoke at the Third
Congregational Church yesterday evening
upon the "Garden of Eden and the Fall of
Man." He declared that common-sense
reasoning must be used in the pulpit in inter
preting such inspirations of the Bible as the
story of Adam and Eve aud the Garden of
Eden, for by enshrouding Biblical tales ia
superstition the present generation is turned
from relie;ous love to the" popular skepticism,
lor intellectual relief. He took Evangelist
Moody to task for venturing the assertion tnat
the Biblo stands or lalis simply upon man's
belief in the truth of the story of Jonah, as
serting that by doing so Moody unconsciously
dnves as many from the hibie as he draws to
it. Continuing the speaker said that Biblical
stories should not De taken too literally.
.Many of them should be interpreted in an
allegorical tense, the Garden of Eden and the
serpent standing rather for right and wrong
and the impulse or motive to sin.

A FIELD DAY AT
SCHUETZEN PARK
Several Important Compe
titions Were Decided
Yesterday.
The California Schuetzen Club's
Diamond Medal Is Won
by N. Fredericks.
Bulissye and Monthly Medal Shoots
Draw Crowds â Marksmen Also
S :cct for Turkeys.
Yesterday was a field day at the Schuet
zen Park ranges, and several important
events were decided among the various
organizations which tnere do congregate.
Admittedly the most exciting of such
contes-ts was the final bullseye shoot for
men oi tlie California Schuetzen Club,
which completed the series for the year,
and gave tbe much covetea diamond
medal to N. Fredericks. These shoots
have been held every third Sunday in tbe
month since January last, and under the
rules and regulations which govern the
award the result is based upon the seven
best centers of a possible twelve for tue
year. Every competitor is allowed twenty
shots during each monthly shoot, and of
these twenty the best center goes to his
credit and is measured to the thousandth
part ol an inch. N. Fredericks, the for
tunate, winner of the trophy, had an ag
gregate score of 3310 points for seven cen
ters measured, or an average of a fraction
over 472 points.
Albert Ehrenpfort, who won the medal
last year, was apparently out of the run
ning on this occasion, tbe champion's
keenest rivals being A. Strecker with
3346 points, O. Bremer with 3921 points
and H. Schrader with 4198. Fredericks is
a memuer of t-ome sour or five years'
standing, and, though in every respect a
fim-cla-s shot, has never before held the
diamond medal.
The highest averace for the year, which,
it will be understood, is estimated in in
verse proportion to the number of points,
does not always represent the best single
individual periormance. T:.e most sensa
tional center yesterday, for example, fell
to H. Kuhls, a cadet, who could not on
that account compete with members of
hi'ber grarte.
He scored what was virtually a dead
center, or only the sixty-sixth one tliou
sÃndth part of an inch away t erefrom,
and will be awarded' a special prize. C.
Eging won the monthly bullseye shoot
with 89 points, and A. Breuss followed
with 145. The complete scores are ap
pended, the first seven being given in or
der of merit:
W. H. Kuhls 66. C. Eging 89, A. Breuss 145,

The ladies' section of the California
Schuetzen Club was actively engaged dur
ing the latter half of the afternoon in de
ciding its monthly medal competition and
concurrently the annual championship.
Tne results, respectively, were asunder:
Monthly shootâ Champion ela-s, Mrs. J. Uts
chig, 115; first-ciass, Mrs. H. L. Wise, 114; sec
ond class, Mrs. Sirecker, 98.
For the yearâ Champion, Miss Lizzie Uts
chig; first-class, Mrs. H. L. Wise; second-class,
Mrs. Davidson.
The foregoing names serve to indicate
that skill with the rifle is not confined to
the male memb rs ol' the same family.
Adjoining tne ladies of the California
Scbuetzen Club the members of the Verein
Eintracht held a special buliÂ«eye shoot,
which resulted as follows: First. F. A.
Kuhls; second, Joseph Rohrer; third, T.
Bmner; fourth, C. yon Hartwig; fifth, C.
tiumbei; sixth, C. F. Over; seventh, Louis
Schmidt.
The San Francisco Turner Schuetzen
also held its monthly medal shoot. The
distribution of medals for the year will
take place on the second Wednesday of
next month. Tbe scores yesterday were
as follows:
Championship class, J. Utschig, 410;
first class, L. Tbierbach, 377; second class,
not won; first best shot, K. Finking, 25;
last best shot, F. Attinger, 25.
During the intervals in the prize shoot
ing the club members present shot and
bowled for pias, turkeys and geese, of
which a large quantity were carried off
for Christmas consumption.
MILITARY MARKSMEN.
Great Preparations for the Inter-
Republic Match With the
Hawaiians.
The military marksmen of the National
Guard were out in large numbers at the
Shell Mound rifle range yesterday, and
from early in the forenoon until dusk the
roar of musketry was echoed against the
Berkeley Lulls. Tbe occasion of all this
shooting was the big inter-republic ritie
match that is to take place on January 10
between teaics of 100 men from the First
Regiment National Guard of California
and the Hawaiian National Guard at
Honolulu. The match is for a trophy,
and each man is to fire ten shots at 200
yards.
From all tbat can be learned tbe Ha
waiian team is doing some excellent work
at practice, and the marksmen of the First
Regiment here are satisfied that they have
no soft snap; hence the active practice
yesterday. This will be kept up to the day
of the match.
Representatives of each team will be
present at the range of the rival, and the
scores, individuals and totals will be ex
changed by mail on the sailing of the first
steamers after the "vent.
Captain O. E. White of the Hawaiian
team was present on the range yesterday,
and he was introduced to the competitors
of his team by Captain J. E. Kline. Cap
tain White has been East, but be will
leave in time to participate in the event.
Wuile strolling about the shooting stand
he observed closely what the riflemen
were doing, but he made no companions
between the California and tbe island
riflemen. In speaking of the island marks
men Captain White stated tliat many of
the riflemen here believe that the Ha
waiian riflemen use Sharp and Winches
ter rifles.
Oniy a few <~10 so, but the guard proper
use SrÂ»rinptiel is in all matches and the
Lee magazine rifle. So in that respect the
men there have an advantage. The island
marksmen have recently made a new 200
-yard range near the seashore, so that the
eenerai conditions are similar to those of
the Shell Mound range.
In the practice shoot yesterday the
annexed scores were made:

Major- General Ruger Will
Go on the Retired List
Next April.
The Gallant Brigadiers Who
Are on the Line of
Promotion.
Army and Navy Fcotb:ll Team Prac
ti:ingâ Lieutenant Carson's
Important Mission.
Major-General Ruger, TT. S. A., will re
tire April 12, 1897, and Mnjor McKinley
will, therefore, have the pleasure if pro
moting one of t^e brigadiers a grade
higher. Tbe senior brigadier-general is
John R. Brooke, who will retire in 1902.
He has a distinguished record for gahant
service in the field, having been breveted
for meritorious service atAntietam, Get
tysburg and Spottsylvania, and finally
promoted to be brigadier-general of volun
teers for gallant service throughout the
war.
An officer witb a record of equal dis
tinction, and one who was breveted for
bravery and merit on the field of Ciiicka
mauga, Cedar CreeK, Opegnon and Five
Forks, is Brigadier-General James W.
Forsyth. He was also promoted to be
brigadier-general of volunteers for gal
lant conduct throughout tbe war.
Tbe gossip goes that General Forsyth
may be promoted major-general on the
retirement of Genera! Rugsr. It is possi
ble that the President, wiio was himself a
gallant soidier, may consider the equities
of the case.
The promotion of General Brooke, who
does not retire until 1902, would preclude
General Forsytb from the possibility of
attaining the rank of major-eeneral.
Should General Forsyth, however, reieive
the appointment, be would serve until
August '26, 1898, the date of his retire
menu Then should the President be" so
minded General Brooke might be ap
pointed ruiij >r-general, to serve from 1898
until 1902. In this way two officers, who
attained high honors on the fiel-i oi battle
might receive a full measure of recogni
tion from their countrymen.
General Forsyth had the special honor
of serving as the ch:ef-of-staff to General
Sheridan, and his name is associated with
many of Sheridan's brilliant victories. It
is probable that tlie friends of Brigadier-
Generals Frank Wheatcn and E. C. Otis
will not be idle wnen tne time comes for
naming another major-general.
The point is raised that General Miles,
commanding the army, would not recom
mend the advancement of General For
syth, but men in tbe army who keep well
posted fancy that the commandingg en
eral would not cast bis influence lor or
against any officer.
It is an open secret tbat General Miles
himself expects Congress to extend to
him tbe honors accorded to bis predeces
sors at the head of tbe army, and there
fore be would not do anything so ill ad
vised as to excite tbe preju lice of General
Foray th's larg*Â»ci'rcleof influential friends.

The Army and Navy football team,
which has been organized to play the

in Central Park January 9.
Among tha officers of tbe Third Artil
lery may be found some good players.
Lieutenant Ames of Battery A, who will
go to tbe center of the Army and Navy
team, is regarded as ono of the leading
players of the United States. The navy
can turn out several superior men. Lieu
tenant Is'oian of the First Infantry is an
other piayer of unquestioned merit. The
team will get down to bard practice work
this week.
The board of army officers appointed to
devise a programme for athletic contests
in which all tbe troops in the Department
of California may be represented held
several sessions in tbe army building last
week. Other sessions will be held this
week. The preparation of the plan in
volves considerable work, as all branches
of the service must be considered.
The programme of Lyceum instruction
at Fort Mason during the season bas

and projectile?. Six subjects are re

According to special orders No. 154 from
headquarters Department of California,
Second Lieutenant Thomas G. Carson,
Fourth Cavalry, has an important duty to
perform, whicb will probably require the
use of twenty yards of red tape. He is
appointed special inspector in the case of
one mule, the property of the United
States, left at Madrone, Cal., by tha squad
ron of the Fourth Cavalry, in an unser
viceable condition.
Lieutenant Carson will proceed to
Madrone, Cal., arrange for the disposition
of the mule, and on completion of this
duty return to his station.
This mule, being the property of the
United States, is owned by seventy mil
lion- of people. In making a disposition
of the animal Lieutenant Carson should
jealously guard the interests of tbe Nation.

WOUNDED BY A
BOLD BURGLAR
Thomas P. Murphy, an
Old Painter, the
Victim.
He Was Roused From Sleep by
the Noise of a Man in
His Room.
The Burglar Struck Him on fie Hra:
Wi;h a R.volvr and Rifl d
His Pockets.
A burglary and attempted murder were
committed at the residence of Mrs. Gal
lagher, on Tweuty-firat and Douglass
streets, early yesterday morning.
Mrs. Gallagher keeps a small rooming
house and has two roomers â Thomas P.
Murphy, a painter, 67 years of age, and a
man named Erickson. Saturday night
Mrs. Gallagher and her boy, accompanied
by Erickson, went to Shipley street to
visit her daughter-in-law.
They did not return till about 1:30
o'clock Sunday morning, and when they
entered the house they were alarmed to
discover Murphy moaning in bed and cov
ered with blood. He told them that
burglars had broken into the house a few
minutes previous to their return and one
of them had struck him over the temple
with the butt end of a revolver and bad
threa;ened to kill him.
It was found that Murphy was bleeding
from a deep wound on the left temple, the
blow from tbe revolver having burst an
artery. Murphy was taken to the City
and County Hospital. It was feared that
bis skull might have been fractured, but a
careful examination showed that it was
intact.
"I was just going to sleep," said Mur
phy, "wnen I was roused up by hearing a
man walking around my bed. Thinking
it was EriCKson, I said, 'Is that you, Er
ickson?'and a man, with an oath, told
me to shut np. I said: 'None ot your
fooling. Why don't you co to bed?' The
man said, 'Look here, I want your money,
and let me have it. quick.' With that
be struck me on the head with tbe butt
end of hispistol, rendering me unconscious
for two or three minutes.
"When I recovered I said, 'For God's
sake don't kill me. If you want my
money it is all in my pocket, about $2.'
The man said. 'Where's Erhkson; aren't
you Erickson?' I told him my name was
Murphy, and he said if I didn't etop talk
ing he would kill me.
"He opened Erickson's trunk and
searched through it for mi ney I suppose,
but he did not get any, and then be took tbe
$2 out of my trousers pocket and left ihÂ«
room. There were two of them, as I could
hear another man walking up and down
the hallway. As there was no light in
the room I could not give a description of
the man who struck me with tbe revolver
and nfled my pockets."
Murphy was weak from loss of blood,
and the shock to his system, owing to ois
aj.*e, may nave serious results.
Sergeant Anderson and a posse were de
tailed on the case by Lieutenant Burke,
bui although the who>e neighborhood and
surrounding districts were scoured no
trace of the burglars could be found.
The fact that the burglar asked Murphy
"Where's Erickson?" has led 10 the behef
that he was. not a stranger to the house.
The inmates have been cautioned by tbe
police not to give any information, but it
was learned from the neighbors that two
men visited the house early in the even
ing and one of them asked Erickson if be
could change a $20 gold piece, aa he
wanted to "rush the growler." Erickson
gave him the change and it is suspected
that the same two men were the burglars
and they were after Erickson's money.
JOOKEY SLOAN HAS COME
He I ncÃji-.t in an Impromptu Set-to
With a Turfman at His Hotel.
About the only bright, sparkling, spicy
bit of news in tbe world of turfdom yes
terday was tbe arrival at a downtown
botel from St. Louis or thereabouts of
Tod Sloan, accompanied by seven trunks,
two valet?, his brother, Cash, and a band
some English setter dog. Tbe Sloan
retinue does not quite occupy one floor
of tbe hotel, though the remaining
tenants have been given orders to vacate.
T. Sloan, jockey, had not long been a
guest of the hotel ere he caused a flutter
of excitement in the rotunda by engag
ing in a mixup with a turfman by the
name of Al Adler, a New Yorker. T.
Sloan, jockey, jocularly made a swipe at
Mr. Adier of New York with a walking
siiik, which, hao it landed, would un
doubtedly have rocked Mr.Adlerof the first
part in the cradle of the deep. Now, T.
Sloan, jockey, is not a big man, but his
prowess as a duelist and tighter is world
wide, and but lor the timeiv intervention
of the well-known millionaire turfman E.
J. Baldwin Mr. Adler'a friends by this
time might be flocking to the florists and
ordering anchors, broken columns and
other sundry appurtenances that go to
make up v tirst-class burial party.
As it so happened, Mr. Adler was at last
accounts resiing easily and T. Sloan,
jockey, was in full possession of the situa
tion, busily encaged receiving the con
gratulations of his friends.
Ed Powers, an exceedingly clever and
popular New Yorfe sporting sciibe, arrived
here on Saturday, fully determined 10 try
a California winter.
Charley Dwyer, a son of the noted East
ern turfman, and Plunger Mike Dwyer
also, stepped in yesterday from tne East
ern country.
A St. Louis paper has this to say in re
sard to the raising of the scale of weights
in the Wesiern racing section:
Early In January the Western Turf Congress
will hold its annual meeting. At that time
new rules prepared by Secretary Hopper of
Cincinnati will be considered, soys the En
quirer. It is also probable thai the Western
iurf Congress will follow the leal set by the
Jockey Club at its meeting the other day and
raise the scale of weights. If it does this it
will put a lot of jockeys who have been out of
the business back on the turf again. Under
the new scale races exclusively for three-year
olds the weight will be 126. a raise of four
pounds over the scale oi mis year, and two
year-olds 122, also a raise ot lour pounds.
There will be no ducking in handicaps, as
the too weigiit must always be 126. If tne top
weight should "scratch" the next weight to it
is raised to 126, and every oiher weight under
it will be raised iv proportion. Say, for in
stance, there is a handicap with the loliowing
entries and weiKhts: First Mate, 126; JRsmiro,
122; souffle, 121: Loki, 117; lieu Holiiday,
115; Hermes, 108; Volimi, 100; Lufra, 95.
Then suppose that First Mate, Kamiro, Souffle
and Lolti are declared. 'Ifcis woul'i leave Ben
Holladay with 115 pounds as the weight. In
order to start, Ho;iadÂ»y would have to take up
126, and this would Cause eleven pounds to be
added to all the others making the new
wei htsâ Hermes, 119; Volmu, 111; Lufra,
106. This would give a chance to jocfcsysliite
Monk Overton, Tiny Williams, Chippie Ray
and others who have been out of it. J)cseys
like Soup Perkins, Joe Scherrer and Russell,
who are fast taking on weight, would be able
to stay in the business a long time. A few old
limers like P.ke Barnes, Ike Lewis, Mat Mona
hftn ai.d George Cochrau might also get back
in the business.

THE ROPE BROKE.
Simon Brsner, a Despondent Painter,
Makes an Unsuccessful Attempt to
Hang Himself.
Simon Braver, a painter, made a sensa
tional attempt to bang himself yesterday
morning at tbe old reservoir on Hermann
and Buchanan streets.
Between 7 and 8 o'clock Mrs. Desmond,
who lives on the top of the hill, heard
cries for help, and on investigating she
discovered Braver lying in the bottom of
a cement well about twenty feet deep. He
told her that he had fallen into the well
and ha. 1 sprained his right ankle, and he
wanted her to bring a doctor. Bhe noti
fied the Seventeenth-street police station,
and Policeman Connell arrived in a few
minutes with the patrol wagon.
Connell, after some difficulty.got Braver
out of the well and carried him on his
back down the hill to the patrol wagon.
He was then taken to the Receiving Hos
pital, and subsequently to the City and
County Hospital.
Braver had tied a thick piece of twine
around a scantling that supports the high
board fence around tne reservoir and then
tied the other end round his neck. The
scantling is close to the well, and Braver,
after adjusting the noose round his neck,
umpeu into the well. The twine was not
strong enouph to support the strain and
broke, letting Braver fall to the bottom.
Braver is 22 years of age. He has not
been able to obtain work for months, and
has kept himself from starvation by doing
odd jobs around saloons. He bad no
home and no money, and rendered des
pera.te by his bad luck he tried to hang
himself.
To make a smooth hole in a sheet of
glass, pack wet clay upon the surface an i
outline the hole in the clay. Then pour
melted lead in the hole and a circle of
glass will drop out.
Explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for to*
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hich" means high barometric . pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high in thÂ» interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
Will produce an opposite result. . .

90S Broadway, Dec. 20. j
The promoters of the movement to close
the saloons in this city on Sunday will
present their petitions to the City Council
at its meeting Monday evening requesting
that body to submit the question to the
electors at the regular municipal election
in the spring.
This is quite a surprise, as it is only ten
days ago it became known such a move-
ment was afoot, and even now it is not
known wno is at the back of the worK.
the city to-day the cnurcii
i ocrs were requested to sign the following,
Avhich goes before the Council to-morrow
"^vening:
To the Honorable, the City Council of the City
o/ Oakland, County of Alameda. State of Caii
forniaâGentlemen: The undersigned resi
deutÃ and voters of the City of Oakland re
spectfully petition your honorable body to
pass an ordinance or take such other action
as you may deem proper and necessary In
order to submit to the voters of the city of
Oakland at the approaching municipal e'.ec
tion the question of the closing from each
Saturday night at 11 o'clock to the ensuing
Monday morning at 6 o'clock of all places in
said city where spirituous, malt or fermented
liquors or vines are sold at retail. And your
petitioners will ever pray.
In a sermon on "The New Enlistment"
this morning, the Rev. C. W. Hill, pastor
of the Tenth-avenue Baptist Church, East
Oakland, referred to the saloon, claiming
that it struck at the civil life, at the
schools, at the church, at tbe home and at
the maniiood. Like the Israelites, tbe
people of to-day must meet their enemy
in its stronghold and dislodge it. A new
enlistment has been ordered under the
Anti-saloon League and it is hoped that
all Israel will be found numbered. Con
tinuing, he said:
"Theie is a prospect of a great battle
with the liquor power in Oakland. I hope
later through the Anti-Saloon League on
t.'^e proposition of driving the saloons out
entirely. But just now on the proposi
tion of Sunday closing. The last attempt
failed. Why? One or two councilmen
weakened. They said they did not know
whether the people wanted Sundayclosing
or not. The C. E. petitions did not satisfy
them. Now we come upon another plan,
asking for an election for an expression of
opinion."

turned away because of the lack of room i
The afternoon was a beautiful one, and
frienas of the institution had come from
all sections of the immediate community,
as well as from Oakland and San Fran
cisco.
A long programme of purely sacred
music was rendered, and each selection
was received with much applause. But
few encore^ were responded to because of
the length of the performance. It was a
delightful afternoon with sucti masters as
Verdi, Schubert, Liszt, Marsh, Smart,
Wieniawski, Handel, Gounod, Capocci,
Himmel, Sherwood, Bach, Corey and
Haydn.
A feature of the exercises was the sing
ing and playing of Miss Gussie Mast, Vie
marvelously clever and versatile per
former whose renditions have marked
j each concert at the institute for the past
four or five years. Besides singing three
difficult solos, she rendered two equally
classic piano and pipe-organ selections.
Miss Mast possesses a rich, we!J culti
vated soprano voice, with an unusually
! wide range. She gives promise of becom
! ing a worthy successor of Miss Christine
Labaraque, tbe blind lady singer who, after
graduating from the institute, took a de
gree from the State University, and who
should be familiar to all who are in touch
with tue State school.
The riano quartet of MlÂ«s Helen Mesow,
Mixs Lena Lrickson, Master Charles Co
ceres and Master John Fish, all of whom
are under 13 years of age and who had
never performed in pub;ic before, was
much appreciated.
Another piano quartet, "Hallelujah
Chorus," arranged by Professor Otto
Fleissner, the musical director of the in
stitution, was well rendered by Misses
i Kate Stollberg and Hattie Young and
Masters Eben Gay and Lucien Baciga
! lupi. Tbe other selections on the pro-
I gramme, in theirorder'of rendition, were as
follows: Pilgrim Chorus from "Lombardi"
(Verdi); piano solo, "Serenade" (Schu- j
| bert-Liszt), Thomas Morrison: organ solo, j
Allegro Moderato in D (Smart), Mis-
Liiy Smith ; soprano so o, ''The Lord Is!
My Lig'.it ' (Marsh), Miss Gussie Mast; I
violin solo, "Kuss'an Airs" (Wieniawski),
Miss Madeline Beckhausen; piano solo,
"Impromptu," op. 90, No. 4 (Schubert),
Miss Gussie Mas;; organ solo, "Medita
tion" (Capocci), Master Thomas Morri
son; barytone solo, "Tlie Battle Prayer"
(Himmei), William Brooks; piano solo,
"The Nun and the Fountain" (Sherwood),
Miss Lily Smith ;| "Aye Maria," soprano,
violin, organ, piano (Gounod-Bach),
' Miss Gussie Mast and Miss Lillie
| Smith, and Messrs. Henry Heyman
j and Otto Fleissner; organ solo "Nazareih"
'(Gouno:), arranged by George E. Whit
! ney, Miss Giusie Mast; chorus, "Great Ia
the Lord" (Haydn). The audience joined
with the chorus in singing thedoxol* gy.
By request from a number ot the au
dience. Miss Mast sang "The Holy City"
immediately after her organ solo.
The school will close for thle Cnristmas
vacation on the 24th. Exercises will be
resumed on January 4..
For Starving Indiana.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 20.â The citi
zens of Berkeley are taking a deep and
active interest in the cause of the starving
millions in India ana have organized for
the systematic collection of "corn and
coin" for the unfortunate Asiatics. A
"famine fund" committee has been organ-
I ized and at the sugeestion of President
I Kellogg ot the State University the foilow
; ing five gentlemen will be asked to consti
| tute a board of managers for the fund, it
; being tne purpose of tho projectors to ex
j tend their work of collecting over the en
tire coast with Berkeley as the center of
activity :
Mayor Sutro of San Francisco, Hon.
Horace Davis, Captain Goodnll, J. J. Val
entine, president of Wells, Fargo & Co.,
and Frank M. Wilson of Berkeley. Sev
eral of ths gentlemen named have already
been consulted as to serving on the board,
and have cheerfully accepted the trust.
W. W. Clark of Berkeley has been chosen
general manager of the fund, and in out
lining the system of collection which will
be adopted he said to-day:
"We have had 100 subscription blanks
struck off, which will be placed in tbe
Lands of responsible parties for circula
tion.
All banks of commercial standing will
be constituted as depositories for these
funds. All funds subscribed through the â 
collectors or banks will be drawn on and |
forwarded in money or food. The work
of collection will begin at once. We have
about $300 on hand now, and we hope! to
soon have $3000 and as much more as pos
sible."

resents Dr. Wendte's offer to the public
libraries of a contribution in the form of a
Catholic paper, standing on its rights as a
taxpayer to have Catholic papers furnished
at the public expense, and such as will
represent the Catholic sentiment on the
coast. The company officers have drawn
up resolutions to this effect.

In the early part of each afternoon hun
dreds of ladies from this side of the bay
depart for San Francisco with heavy
purses and empty arms. Toward evening
they as regularly return laden with every
conceivable kind of package and bringing
i home empty pur es. It ia no exaggeration

has been proposed to organize a league,
the members of which bind themselves to
purchase only in Oakland. Such amove
is at once foolish and a confession that by
crossing the bay more satisfaction can be
obtained. The fault is not to be remedied
by any such method. People will invari
ably patronize those places of business
where they know they can get the most
satisfaction for their money. The fault
lies with the merchants. They may or
ganize boards of trade and merchants'
exchanges and leagues of progress till
doomsday and they will not keep custom
on this side the bay by such methods.
As a matter of fact, the Oakland store
keeper, by paying less rent than is de
manded of laree storekeepers in San
Francisco, can place the same goods on
the market at a lower price, and in many
instances this is done. But the people do
not snow it. W T hat is needed is, not home
industry leagues, but genuine enterprise
on the part of the storekeepers. With all
its boasted volume of trede there are not

as a result the city's progress is somewhat
in keeping with tbe pace of that animal.
People in this city who want to go shop
ping are not fond of taking a cold trip
across the bay, in addition to the long
trip by a tedious train before they read,

that they can get more for a dollar in Oak
land than they can at San Francisco then
they will purchase at home. The blame is
not with them but with those who cater
to them.
After the experience of the past week it
must be ad mitted thai Oakland is a critical
city in the matter of music and the
drama. On several occasions since the
opening of the Macdonough opportunity
has arisen to judge of the taste of local
theater-goers, but during the past month
there have been enough instances to form
a reliable opinion. It has been demon
strated that no company that cannot com
mand good business in San Francisco
need attempt to try to paJtn themselves
off on Oakland. ThÂ« Katie Emmett Com
pany did not appear across the bay for
obvious reasons, and in this city it proba
bly paid for lighting the house, but no
more. During the past week an opera
company has been at the theater, but it
was very sparsely patronized; but such
patronage as it was accorded was cerlainly
all that it deserved. In strong contrast to
these occasions must be mentioned the
visit of Mme. ZeiÂ«sler, Miss Helen Beach
Yaw, the Delia Fox Company and Loie
Fuller. All these attractions were legiti
mate and Oakland showed :ts appreciation
of them. Wuen such artists as De Wolf
Hopper, Mme. Nordica, Modjeska, Ada
Reban, Wilton Lackaye and others of sim
ilar caliber occupy the boards they never
have the dissatisfaction of seeing empty
seats.
While it is not to be supposed that there
will be a subway beneath the estuary for
several years, there can be no doubt but
that such a method is the only legitimate
solution of the problem of travel to the
further shore of that body of water. In
foggy weather, and with shaky bridges,
there will always be some likelihood Of an
accident to passing trains, not only those
crossing the bridges, but those that cross
at right angles to each other on First
street.
It required some very serious accidents
on the Mersey before the immense tunnel
was built between Liverpool and Birken
head, and there are no more foggy days in
Lancastershire uuring the winter than on
the bay of San Francisco. At the present
time there is not the travel between Oak- j
land and Alameda or .Oakland and San |
Fmncisco via Alameda that there was be- i
tween the :wo citie3 on the Mersey when
thftt jubway was built, but each year is
seeing a marked increase in local "travel, j
and sooner or later a tunnel will be a j
necessity.
An argument equally as forcible in favor j
of a tunnel is tne enormous increase of j
Oakland's shipping interests. More car
goes have been handled witcin the past I
month at Oakland wharves than in any I
three months of the city's history. At
the present time an average of about
twenty ships per day pass through the
bridges, and this number is gradually in- |
creasing. As the narrow-cauge trains
cross every half hour, and as it takes
nearly that time for a large vesstl to be
safely navigated througn the draw, the
time is not far distant when a narrow
gauge time-table will be a useless mass of
figures.
Colonel Bridges, who is considered an
authority on such matters, has prepared
plans which are based on a knowleee of i
the conditions, and it is the wish of every j
person living on either side of the estuary i
that they may soon be followed out. If it j
can now be shown that the building of the j
tunnel would not cost more in proportion j
to its increased value as regards traffic
than an adequate steel drawbridge, the
main point in its favor will have been
gained.
The encouraging news that work has
been actually commenced on the proposed
electric road between this city and Liver
ruore will be received with marked satis
faction by the iarmers who live along its
route, which is north of the county road
and south of the foothills. The success
which has attended the Haywards electric
road, is a sufficient guarantee that when a
new road to Livermore is in operation it
will develop much territory now lying
idle and add largely to the productive ele
ment of the population. Before the Hay
war ds line waa opened, the county road,
except where the town of San Leandro is
situated, was practically deserted be
tween Fruitvale and Haywards. At the
present time little settlements are to be
found everywhere; the thriving town of
Elmhurst has been incorporated where
formerly was not a single nouse, and there
ia not a stretcn of more than a few blocks
along the whole distance tnat is not in
habited. Undoubtedly the same result
would follow the opening of a road to
Livermore. With the developments at
Corral Hollow and the gradually increas
ing population in that neighborhood, such
a line has a bright future. Should the
projector Mrs. Cunningham of the Liver
more League of Progress to establish a
produce exchange in this city De carripd
out, the ranches south of the foothills
would most certainly take advantage of
such a opportunity to place their prod
uce in a good market.

LOCAL OPTION CAMPAIGN.
The Anti-Saloon League Will Ask That
the City Charter Be Amended
This Spring.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 20.â The Board
of Trustees will be requested by a lengthy
petition to amend the city charter in such
a manner that the question of licensing
saloons will be placed upon the ballot at
every general election. The anti-saloon
league has the matter in hand and will
make every effort to secure an unbiased
vote upon the proposition.
The agitators in this movement are pre
paring to secure an enactment that will
prohibit all saloons in such political
division of the towns as vote against hav
ing them, and permitting them where a
majority of the voters favor them. This
idea is favored by a large number of busi
ness men who do not want saloons in the
residence neighborhood, but do favor, or
at least do not object to them, in the busi
ness part of the City.
Petitions are now in circulation that will
be presented to the trustees at the proper
time. It will have the backing of all the
religious and semi-religious organizations
as well as parties whose residence property
is affected by the present order of tilings*.
Thinking of Others.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 20.â The com
mittee in charge of the work of caring for
the poor families of this city, under the
supervision of the Christian Endeavor
Union, desires that all who have anything
in the way of toys, food, fuel, clothing,
etc., for them would leave the same at tne
vacant store adjoining the Argus office.
Money may be left at the bank, with Mr.

LAWMAKERS IN CONFLICT.
Too Much Anxiety Shown to Secure the
Approval of West Oakland Residents.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 20.â There is
tome friction among the members of the
Alameda County delegation in the next
Legislature. The cause of it is that
standing nuisance, the West Oakland
marsh, and a general desire on the part of
too many members of the delegation to
have it suppressed.
Senator-elect Fred Stratton has given
notice that he is preparing a bill that will
allow of the doing away with such
nuisances. As tne West Oakland marsh
is situated in the Assembly district of
Oscar Breiling and the Senatorial district
of Eli Dennison, it is thought that these
two gentlemen should be permitted to at
tend to it. Mr. Breiling is preparing a
bill for introduction to the Assembly,
which Senator Dennison will carry to the
Senate, and there is likely to be some
strained feeling over the two bills. It is
moat probable, however, that when Sen
ator Straiton is informed of the true state
of affairs, he will withdraw his own bill
and work in support of that of the mem
ber from West Oakland.
Buddhiot Monasteries.
Count Wachtmeister delivered an interest-
Ing lecture on Little Thibit before the Thec

Hall. In the course of his remarks he said
that the city of Ladakah, in Northern India, is
the center of the great school of Buddhism
called Mahay ana. Id and around this city are
many Buddhist monasteries presided over by
its divine head, each monastery claiming the

SAALBURG IS A
LONDON LION
How a San Francisco Boy
Won Fame as a Car
toonist.
A Princely Salary for Being a
Genius With Colors and
Presses.
Phenomenal Success of a Man Who
Was But Recently a Lithog
raper in This City.
Charles W. Saalburg, a San Francisco
boy, has recently made a great hit by lm
newspaper illustrations in Londo i, where
he commands a princely salary with the
Acme Art Company, having left the New
York World, greatly to the regret of its
proprietors.
Only a few years ago this genius was a
humble workman in a San Francisco
lithographer's shop, but he soon became
prominent on a cartoon daily, holding the
position of illustrator until its indecent
cartoons offended his taste, after which he
went :o Chicago and made a decided hit
on the Inter Ocean, where his "Vanishing
City," in colors, became famous.
Color work of a hk'h grade is Saalburg's
specialty. He is the patentee of a process
by which half a dozen or more colors may
be run on a newspaper press at one time.
He achieved fame in New York by getting
out 500,000 colored sheets in three days,
tbe shorte.-t lime on record.
In London, where he recently located,
he found slow presses and inadequate
means of making colored papers.
He foun'l such slow machinery that it
would require four months to do work
which his American presses could turn
out in three days. The Acme Company
induced him to remain in London. They
have ordered American machinery and
are putting up special buildings for the
work and all will be under Saalburg's
supervision.
So popular was one of Mr. Saalburg's

cartoons on McKinley and the tariff that
the President-elect invited the artist to
dine with him last year, and a strong
friendship at once sprang up between the
statesman and the artist. Saalburg's work
is now the talk of Europe.
JORDAN FOR PRESIDENT
Directors of the Academy of
Sciences Are Renom
inated.
No Opposition Is Anticipated at tbe
Forthcoming Election Early ia
January.
The annual election of officers of the
California Academy of the Sciences will
be held at the academy hall January 4,
1897. So far there has been no sign of the
usual campaign among the scientific
people of this institution, and it is said
there will be no contest at the coming
election, a fact which has become possible
through the able management of Professor
Jordan of Stanford University, who has
been president of the academy for tbe past
year.
The nominating committee held a meet
ing Saturday afternoon at the office of the
trustees and toot action on the new ticket.
All the present officers were renominated,
but a few names will have to be added to
the list to complete the ticket.
Lucius H. Foote, treasurer of the acad
emy, said that he bad not heard of any
thing like opposition to the regular ticket.
''It is our earnest desire to lift the acad
emy above little politics, and I believe it
is out of politics now," he continued.
"Under the wise administration of Dr.
Jordan the academy has made much
progress during the year and accom
plished far more than it receives credit
for at home. The curators are each and
every one doing excellent work, ana there
is no fi^sht of any kind within tbe institu
tion. With the new ticket there can
hardly be opposition, as Dr. Jordan for
president will not have an opponent. The
only change will be in the director of the
museum, Mr. Davis having died some time
since, and there will be another director
instead of Mr. W. C. Burnett. But beyond
those changes there is no reason for dis
satisfaction toward the ticket."
The new board will likely be as follows:
Dr. David Starr Jordan, president; Wil
liam E. Ritter, first vice-president; Dr. H.
H. Behr, second vice-president; J. 08.
Gunn, corresponding secretary; G. P.

THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Const Champion Riordan and E, Ma
loney Defeat Amateur Champion
Donnelly and T. F. Bonnet.
Every seat in tbe San Francisco Hand
ball Court was occupied yesterday after
noon, as it was known that at least two
games of more than usual interest would
be played.
The one that roused the greatest inter
est was between John Riordan, the coast
champion, and E. Maloney and P. T.Don
nelly, the amateur champion, and T. F.
Bonnet. Riordan was evidently smarting
tinder his defeat of the previous Sunday, as
he played one of the finest t ames seen in
the court, and he and his partner carried
off the honors. In the other game R.
Linehan and J. J. Feeney defeated J.
Harlow and M. J. Kilgalion.
The hitting on both sides was terrific,"
and the service of Kilgalion was splendid.
M. McNeil and Phil Ryan also played a
great game against Dan Hodgers and R.
Shea, beating them by two games to one,
much to their surprise and wrath.
The Union Court was opened yesterday
under the new management, and a few
fames were played, but no scores were
ept. The wet weather in the beeinning
of last week interfered with the plastering
of the walls, but it is expected that all the
improvements will be finished before next
Sunday.
Following were the games played in the
San Francisco Court :

The preliminary contests which resulted
in tiie selection of ihs foregoing learns
took place December 6 and 13. Yesterday
the first of ihe final competitions took
place at Shell Mound Park, and on Janu
ary 3 the second of the preparatory series
wiii occur.
Louis Barrere. inspector of rifle practice
of the First Infantry, N. G. C, has ad
dressed a circular to his comrades, in
which he says:
This is not an ordinary contest, but one
which should prove of great interest to our
regiment, every member of which should do
all in his power to encourage enthusiasm and
stimulate the â¢ ffortÃ of the men to establish
their superiority as marksmen, so that in the
future they can speak with pride of the deco
rations given in this match.
Colonel W. Macdonald returned to the
City last Thursday. He appreciates the
importance of the contest in which bis
regiment is about to engage. He is not
overconfident of victory, but believes that
his sharpshooters will capture the trophy.
He knows that thue are many crack
shots in the Hawaiian regiment, and is
not inclined to underrate tb.e skill of his
competitors.
The new cavalry troop held a meeting
on Monday evening at its rooms in the
Flood building. Colonel Bush, on behalf
of the committee on permanent organiza
tion, reported that Urn committee would
submit the by-laws at the next meeting
lor adoption.
Captain Margo reported that, a gentle
man had offered the free use of several
good saddle horses until the troop would
be enabled to purchase its own, and that
he understood that several other parties
having horses would offer the same as
sistance to tne organization.
Mn jor C. Jansen, brigade inspector, who
bad been invited to address the members,
tl.en delivered the first lecture of the
series. His remarks were entertaining
And instructive, and in brief were a de
scription of the organization of cavalry in
its early stages, the various mounted
bodies of the several countries of Europe,
tbeir number and condition, the condi
â¢ tion of the cavalry service in the United
States at the breaking out of the rebellion,
the instruction at Carlisle Barracks and
its subsequent achievements under such
cavalry leaders as Sheridan, Custer and
other notea soldiers.
He declared that it was a necessity to
have go d cavalry troops in the National
Guard, who should be well drilled as such
and mounted, with good control of tbeir
horses, and strongly advocated such or
ganizations.
He considered a good mounted body in
valuable in case of internal disturbances,
asserting that a body of cavalry among a
mob would cause immediate dispeision
without entailing the heavy loss of life at
tendant on a bayonet charge or the fir* of
infantry.
He referred to the mounted police of
European cities and stated that he bad no
doubt that if the plans of this organiza
tion were succes fully carried out that it
would be the means of showing to the
police authorities of this City its value
and cause them to organize a drilled
mounted police force.
A vote of thanks was tendered to Major
Jansen, and after enrolling several new
members the meeting adjourned until this
evening, when the second lecture of the
series will be delivered.
One of the first bills to be introduced at
the coming session of the Legislature will
be a measure to increase the number of
companies of the National Guard, and
this bill will probably provide for two
more mounted companies and at least one
battery of light artillery. Jt strikes mili
tary men as something rather remarkable
that an organization of troops numeri
cally as strong as the National Guard of
California should not possess a single sec
tion of field artillery.
The troops are more concerned in the
legislation providing for new uniforms,
blankets and overcoats than in measures
for an increase of the force. The Legisla
ture is counted on as one friendly to tne
guard, and liberal appropriations are an
ticipated .
MERCED, Cau, Dec. 17.â The presenta
tion of the military drama "'Twixt Love
and Diuy," by Company H, Sixth In
fantry Regiment, was a great success, both
financially and artistically. The general
comment of the citizens of Merced ranks
it much ahead of any ama:eur perform
ance ever given in the city. The boys of
the company are much gratified at the re
sult of their labors, as it exceeded even
their fondest hopes. The piay was given
under the direct. on of H. A. Rayner, an
actor of merit, who carried the leading
part with ability. Robert Newell as Philip
Marks, the Confederate officer, handled a
difficult role in a very creditable manner.
The members of the company insist that
he must enlist now. Sergeant Guthrie as
Sorkery Schneidelbocher seemed to enjoy
playing his pare as much as the audience
did in laughing at his genuine German
dialect and droll acting.
Mrs. Captain Graham carried the part
of Bess Marks in a very clever manner.
Miss Myrtle Graham as Mrs. Armitage,
tne mother of the hero, captivated the
audience, and Miss Theresa McDonald
sustained the double role of the Magda
lene Nurse and Goddess of Liberty par
ticularly well. Little Hazel Badt as the
orphan" enacted her part very sweetly.
Corporal G.iffin as General Banks por
trayed the stern soldier in an admirable
manner, and Private Fen try was a good
Colonel Williard. Corporal Adrian and
Privates Rosenthal and Cassad carried
themselves as true soldiers. Dunn's or
chestra kindly volunteered to furnish the
music for the boys.
Second Lieutenant Daniel G. Bambauer
has forwarded his resignation to the adju
tant-general and the members of the com
pany are now figuring on a successor. It
is expected that the election will be
ordered for an early date.
Owing to the uncertainty of the weather
the attendance at the monthly target prac
tice was small last Sunday. The sky was
overcast, which probably accounted for
the absence of high scores. The following
members scores of over thirty points:
Plyler 39, Corporal George 38, Corporal
Grim'.h 36. Smith 35, Sergeant Jones 3*,
Griffith Jr. 34, Sergeant Outline 33, Captain
Graham 31, Lieutenant Smith 31.
The citizens' medal, which is awarded
to the best scor<- made at each shoot, was
won by Private Piyler.
The class medals are given out every
other month, two scores counting on the
classification. They were won as follows:
First class, Corporal Griffith; second class.
Corporal George ; third class. Captain
Graham; fourth class, Private Keliey.
FORMING A NEW CHURCH
A Social Reform Movement on
the Basis of Chris
tianity.
Rer. C. W. Henning of Oakland Lec
tures Before a Small Audience
in This City.
The social reform meeting in Washing
ton Hall on Eddy street, where tbe Rev.
C. W. Henning of Oakland lectured last
evening, was not largely attended, but as
this new movement haa some earnest ad
herents its leaders were not discouraged at
the small beginning. Mr. Henning dis
coursed on "Who Is Jesus?" but there was
little of tbe nature ot a religious service at
the meeting.
A card of membership or pledge was
given each member oi t c audience at the
door. This was styled the "Basis of
Union" and contained the articles of be
lief of Mr. Henning's adherents as fol
lows:
We whose names are attached hereto, de
sirous of uniting ail the forces that make for
rignteousness, and recognizing in the teach
ing of Jesus ot Nazareth a sufficient guide in
the regeneration of the individual, of society
and of the State, do agree upon this simple
basis of union, and cordially invite all who
will accept his teaching to unite with us in
such studies and practical measures as this
association may elect, in accordance with its
by- aws, to promo'.e and extend the Kingdom
of God on earth.
Provided always and particularly that no
article of belief other than that above indi
cated, or tnat will conflict with the creed of
any evangelical church, shall be imposed
upon any uniting with us.
Upon tins basis of union we pledge ourselves
to teach and practice personal seli-demal and
mutual helpiulness, k> the end that justice,
truth and mercy may be established in the
earth, and that the divine right of every mem
ber oi society to life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness may be secured by our institutions
and laws.
The lecturer said that all the thought of
ages since Christ came upon earth has
centered Around the Savior. "To trace
the development of the Jesus idea," he
added, "would be exceedingly interest
ing, but I have not time for that to-night.
Suffice to say that in ail lands there has
been a groping after God, and we can dis
cover three steps toward the understand
ing of the divinity â our likeness to God,
nearness to God and oneness between him
and man. We have discovered in man
what is so near the divine, and hence the
expression sometimes tiiat man is near to
God."
Quoting tbe Old Testament, he said tnat
men were called "the friends of God,"
"tbe sons of God." So when Jesus used
tbia lan ullage be was misunderstood, for it
bad long been forgotten. "Tbe real mean
ing of Jesus must be discovered and again
proclaimed in the ears of tbe world," said
tbe preacher. "He came with a three
fold purpose into the worldâ to reveal God
to niiin, to reveal God in man and to re-
Teal man to man himself."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1896.
REAL ESTATE
MARKET REVIEW
Interest in Land Matters Is
of Much More General
Character.
Trifling Concessions Are Helping
Materially to Satisfactorily
Consummate Sa'es.
Matters in the Building Line Have
Been Quite Active During
the Past Y?ar.
Matters in the real estate line are de
cidedly better. Interest is of much more
general character and real estate offices
are assuming the old business aspect. In
quirers are far more numerous ami their
questions are propounded with greater
positiveness. Results are also showing to
increased advantage in the way of trans
actions. Buyers and sellers are getting
nearer to each other, and when such a
condition prevails there is every prospect
that actual trade is pretty close at band.
There is more of a disposition shown on
the part ot owners to listen to offers and
trifling concessions on both sides are help
ing materially to satisfactorily consum
mate sales.
The ba'ancing of accounts by businessmen
will, however, for a few days largely absorb
attention, and not much time can be expected
to be given to real estate interests until mer
chants, capitalists and tradespeople are satis
fied with t&e condition of their respective
ledgers. While the year now ending might
have presented a greau-r volume of transac
tions, it is satisfactory to snow that ther<.' has
been neither undue influence nor marked de
pression in values. Probably no more pos>
tive evidence of the strength of the real estate
market could be advanced than a comparison
with current prices and those ruling one and
two years ago.
It is reasonable to expect more or less soft
ening of values when the univers-i! ly depressed
condition nt general business which has pre
vailed during to last twelve months is taken
into consideration. But an examination of
matters shows that property quotations indi
cate anything but wild fluctuations, and their
prices, as a rule, keep weil up to the former
standard.
Some sections, it is true, may exhibit trifling
concessions on old figures, whi c others will
really flhow little advance. The former of
those possibilities is presented in the sale of
outside properties.
In the extreme southern and western parts
of the City sellers had to slightly modify their
views in order to realize, while in the bust
i ness centers ol inside property buyers had to
advance their bidding rate in order to secure
what was needed. By these ups and downs,
I however, a happy medium was inaintained.
For many years th-.re has been no such ac
tivity in San Francisco in the line of home
building as for the past twelve months. It
hÂ»s been frequent-y remarked in thu weekly
leal estate coi'iinns of this paper how large
has been the number of building contracts let
and how smali has been the average cost of the
buildings contracted for.
It is the small houses, the small stores, tbe
I two-story fla' s that have multiplied with the
j greatest rapidity, and this means that surplus
i wages have been investe i, that the suburbs
have been covered with homes and that the
outlying districts hnve become more tliiikly
peopled. In Richmond, In tne West Mission,
in the Potrero, in Ocean View there has been
the greatest activity. The costly houses have
for the most part been confined to the Western
Addition as the expensive business blocks
have been to the downtown districts. If in
these latter portions of the City the rush of
building has not been so inarkoa as in the
more remote districts, it is still safe to assume
that prosperity is general, for when the
masses, the erripioves, are prosperous and con
tented the employers must be finding business
good.

The Auditor, claiming that the Board of
Supervisors and not the Board of Education
alone has power to make the purchase of tne
Mission High School property, has not yet
signed the warrant (or the $52,500 to buy the
site recently agreed upon by the Board of
Education.

Colombet land, being a part of the Rancho ia
Laguna beca, situated a few miles south of San
Jose, in Santa Clara County. Ihey will place

thousands will be dotted by innumerable
homes of thrifty settlers. Â«. Â» < â¦
Property-owners in the Sunset District,
south of the Park, are agitating the opening
of Nineteenth avenue, and claim that this im
provement is the duty of the City, inasmuch
as they claim to pay considerably more than
their share ot taxes. There are at present no

wish something to be done in that line.
By a recent decision of the courts the City

Legislature by Assemblyman-elect H. I. Mul
creavy of the Thiny-niutb. Assembly District
regulating the change of grades oa all streets
and highways throughout the State is being
prepared by the attorneys oi the Federation of

constitutional.
Since the Sutro car line has been built
through Richmond district the growth of the
section has been marvelous. Where there
was scarcely a score of people a year or two
ago there are now about 1200 residt-nta. The
peoDie living between Twelfth and Thirtieth
avenues say that a new school should be built
j somewhere in the vicinity of Twenty-fourth
and Point Lobos avenues. The City owns sev
ernl lots which were reserved for school pur
poses, and there will be no expense as far as a
site is concerned.
The Point Lobos Improvement Club has been
ask. d to take the matter in charge, and it will
be brought to tne attention of the Board of
Education immediately after the first of the
year.
If the Clarendon Heights Improvement Club,
which was formed duMng the past week, is
BUCCessiul in having Seventeenth street cut
through to Uranus, which Is to be one of the
first notions of the ciub, the residents of the
Mission district will be afforded a fine drive to
the park. At present there is no direct way to
get to the park from the Mission, and the cut
ting through of Seventeenth street as proposed
will suve a lour-mile roundabout drive.
A number of the property-owners and mer
chants of Seventh street will form an improve
ment ciub shortly for the mirpose of ad
vancing the business interests of that thor
oi:ehfare.
The street committee of the San Francisco

HOSPITAL WARDS
FOR POOR FOLKS
Latest Plan Under Consid
eration by the Salva-
tion Army.
Adjutant McFee the Originator
of a Scheme to Care for
the Sick.
The Old Santa Cruz Broad-Gauge
Depot to Be Made a Shelter
for Men.
The Salvation Army will soon open a
Men's Food and Shelter Home at Santa
Cruz. They have leased the old broad
gauge depot at a nominal price and will
immediately set about making the in
terior a comfortable habitation.
Adjutant McFee. who has been so prom
inently connected with the army the past
six years and who has recently been
called East by Commander Booth Tucker,
has been planning for the last six months
the erection of an army hospital.
The hospital will be conducted in the
interests of the self-respecting poor who
will receive first-class treatment and
nursing at such rates as the working
people can afford. TdÂ«ir idea in the es- '
tablishruent of such a hospital is to pre- j
vent those who otherwise could not afford j
medical treatment and attendance from ;
becoming chronic invalids.
Donations of everything that will make
. the hungry, half-clad poor happy and
comfortable have been pouring in at
the Salvation Army headquarters. The
army nas rented a store at 868 Foisom
street, where the donations will be stored
until the time comes for the general dis
tribution just alter Christmas. Only really
urgent cases will be relieved at present,
lor the array is busy preparing lor its
Christmas dinner, which will be a grand
success, for the public has responded gen
erously. The following donations have

Although vanquished the Alerts should
not feel disheartened, as they were de

ball games played at Central Park within
the la^t two years.
The pitching ot McKee for the Alerts
and of Raymond for the Athletic Club
was of a high order, each striking out

LIKE A DREAM
OF MILLIONS
A Gold Mine Hedged In
by Tangled Forms
of Law.
J. Anderson Discovers Rich
Ore in a Public
Street
He Is Confident It Contains a For
tune, but Ha Cannot
Touch It.
J. Anderson, a builder and contractor
residing at 328 Jersey street, is in a
quandary. Mr. Anderson believes he has
located within the corporate limits of this
City a gold mine which would make him
independently wealthy ifâ but there's the
rub.
About a year ago Mr. Anderson, who
from a two years' residence in the Coeur
d'Alene mines is somewhat conversant
with such matters, discovered a ledge
from sixteen inches to two feet in width
which he was confident was rich in gold.
He siathered a few specimens and then re
turned to his home to meditate. The
ledge was situated in a public street,
where Mr. Anderson prudently declines
to state, and how to locate a mine in a
municipal highway was a difficult prob
lem for the finder to solve.
For a year Mr. Anderson cherished his
secret in the hope that some way of realiz
ing on his find would present itself. In
the meantime the difficulties in the way
of locating the mine seemed so formidable
ROBERT FITZSIMMONS AND HIS PRETTY WIFE, ROSE JULIAN FITZSIMMONS.
Robert Fitzsimmons. the tall, blonde boxer from Australiaâ Bob Fitzsimmons, as he is best knownâ the fighter who
fought Sharkey in the ring and also in the court fora purse of $10,000, winning in the first contest and losing in the
8' cond, was around town all day yesterday bidding his friends good-by. As the big, broad-shouldered man passed quietly
along the sidewalk clad in a ministerial garb he was pointed out by everybody on the street as "Fitzsimmons, who was
jobbed by Earp and Sharkey," so well known is the man who made the sailor turn turtle.
While the public is yet talking about the "famous victoree" the man who failed to get the coin part of it is taking the
matter quietly. He will leave his late opponent to the purse and unenviable glory of that concerted fluke and look forward
to interviewing Mr. Corbett in a fairer manner.
Julian stated yesterday that Fitzsimmons would never consent to enter the ring with Sharkey on any consideration,
but would ignore him in the future.
While Bob was out yesterday making his farewell calls Mrs. Rose Julian Fitzsimmons was at home in her rooms at the
Baldwin racking Baby Bob's pinafores, skirts, flannels and other garniture of infanthood away for the flight East
Pretty Mrs. Bob is outspoken in her contempt for the methods that lost Baby Bob's big dad that pursa and would
not object to telling the naval nero what she thinks of him and his crew. She always accompanies her hatband and is his
chief counselor and guide, taking precedence even of her brother. Fitz is a model hubby and says that very few men have
better wives than he has. She intends to go South with him to meet Corbett when March 17 draws near.
Julian states that they will start East to-night, but possibly not till to-morrow evening. Exhibitions will be given at
Denver, Cripple Creek and other places, the party reaching New York in about three weeks.
Fitzsimmons will need only about twenty days' preparation for the great contest, as he is in good condition for thÂ«
ring now.
that he made no attempt to ascertain the
exact value of his specimens. Last weetc
he determined to at least find out the
richness of his potential mine, and accord
ingly applied to Price & Son, assayers.
Ue was told that the appearance of the
rock was not promising, but appearances
are often deceptive in metallurgies. Ac
cordingly the rock was submitted to the
retorts.
When Mr. Anderson called at the assay
office for his prospect the assayers ex
pressed surprise at the richness of the
specimen. The rock showed $12 40 gold
to the ton, and of silver $2 60, making a
total valuation of $15. Then Anderson's
former perplexity became tantalization.
"It is like a dream of millions," he said
yesterday. "I can see all that wealth and
I am powerless to touch it."
As to what course he will now pursue
Anderson is in the dark. He has made
some inquiries, but so far no plausible
mode of procedure has been suggested.
To-day he purposes searching the rec
ords at the City Hall, doubtless for the
purpose of finding whether or not the
street in which the mine lies is a regu
larly declared highway. Should these
inquiries prove unsatisfactory he intends
to consult mining attorneys, though be
dreads this step, as he is extremely jealous
of his secret. If there appears to him no
course by which he can gain possession of
the ledge without too expensive an outlay
he expects to interest some capitalist in
the matter, a scheme which, in view of
the assay, will probably not be difficult
Althou.'h Anderson speaks guardedly of
the location of his find, It seems probabie
that it is in some of the many streets
which have recently been cut through the
hi. is in the southwestern portion of the
City.
Mr. Anderson is a man of unimpeach
able veracity. He is one of the most
prominent and popular of the Swedish
residents and is well known among me
chanics and business men.

ATHLETES TO
SPAR TO-NIGHT
Five Promising Contests to
Be Decided at the
Olympic Club.
List of Names and Weights of
the Boys Who Will Wear
the Gloves.
Koster, a New Man, Who Will Op
pose Carter, Is Describe! as a
C ever Bozer.
Ten sinewy, muscular and well-trained
athletes will weigh in at the Olympic
Club this evening at 6 o'clock, and with
the conclusion of that necessary formality
everything will be in readiness for the five
j boxing contests which are slated to take
j place in the club gymnasium, commenc
! ing at 8:30 o'clock.
Of the boxers who will contest for su
premacy on that occasion, and whose
names have already appeared in these
i columns, all save one seem to be well
: known to the sporting fraternity.
Tnat exception is Gus Koster, who will
make his debut as the opponent of Stew
art Carter, the present welter-weight cham
pion of the coast. Julian R. Brandon,
I the well-known heavyweight, is, however.
j able to supply some information which
may prove of value to those who are dis
posed to judge the contest in question.
Mr. Brandon has been coaching Koster
for the last nine months, and expresses
himself rs satisfied that his pupil will
give an excellent account of himself.
He is said to be a clever and a pretty
boxer and a hard hitter, while adding to
these qualifications the manifest advan
tages of heieht and length of reach. He
stands 5 feet 10% inches in his stockings
and is only 23 years of age. Both men
are expected to strip at 145 pounds.
Koster has been training faithfully,
and will enter the ring in splendid con
dition. Mr. Brandon put him through
ten quick rounds the other evening by
way ot a finishing touch.
Carter, his opponent, has a reputation
to uphold, and in the opinion of His ad
mirers is well able to succeed in that en
deavor, but neither combatant is expected
to enjoy a walkover. The champion welter
weight is famous for an effective left hook,
by means of which he has discomfited
more than one skillful rival, but Koster
has been specially trained to frustrate
that method of attack. Mr. Brandon him
self has hitherto been very successlul as a
teacher of the noble art.
Many of his former pupils have at
tained prominent positions in the amateur
and professional world. He will second
his latest protege this evening.
The following is a list of the several
events which will be decided this evening,
weights and the name of the club with
which the boxer 3 are connected bein^
piven in each instance: Carter of the
Olympic Club and Koster of the Manhat
tan Club, 145; Hayes of the Olympic and
M. Ejran o t the Manhattan, 135; Mulligan
of the Manhattan and Brown of the Olym
pic, 125; Reay of the Olympic and Lynch
of the San Francisco Athletic Club, 125;
Lawier of the Acme and Schuler of the
Manhattan, 120. Without exception the
men mentioned ar* expected to give a
gentlemanly and spirited exhibition of
skill with the gloves. None but members
of the clubs represented wiil be admitted.
