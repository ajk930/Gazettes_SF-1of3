of the Past
LONDON, Esq., July 27.â The Daily
News to-morrow will publish a dispatch
from its correspondent at Athens report
ing that the lighting has been renewed in
the vicinity of Retimo in the island of
Crete, and that the insurgents have been
successful in their encounter with the
Turkish troops.
The latter are hard pressed and have
telegraphed to Canea for re-enforcements.
IN UNHAPPY CRETE.
In the Face of Horrors of the Past
the Island Patriots Again
Battle for Liberty.
The present trouble in Crete, like the
struggle for indepeollence in 1866, origin- j
ated in the western part of the islandâ in
the province of Kbama â but it is gradu
ally extending as before to the adjoining
province of Retimo.
In these uprisings, as well at those
against the Venetians, who preceded the
Turks as masters of the island, the leading
I borne by the Spahkiats.who are the
lineal representatives of the ancient Cre
tans and have preserved in their moun
tain fastnes.-^es comparatively unimpaired
the character and customs of their ances
tors. They inhabit chiefly the high lands
and upland plains of the Aspia Vuna, or
White Moun:a:ns, and from the rugged
and almost inaccessible nature of tbe
nding country they have always
enjoyed a condition of practical inde
pendence from Jo*etÂ«Â» fule, and on ac
count of their active and warlike habits
have always been very formidable neigh
bors for the dweilers in the cities and
towns along the coast.
Tney constitute the entire population of
the southern slope of the White Moun
tains and almost the entire population of
the towns along the western and southern
coasts from Selino to Spahkia. Their
country is very dificult of access. The
only road leading from the northern to
the soai! .era side of the island west of
Eetimo is the one from Kisamos up the
mountain defiles to the town of Paleo
kastron, and thence through the "lna
chorium" to the town of Sklavopula and
on to Selino on the southern coast. From
Selino the highway is compelled by the
mountainous character of the country to
follow the windings of the coast until it
passes -one distance beyond the town of
Sr*hkia. From this highway â which was
built in ancient times â trails and patns.
impracticable for the passage of troops
with artillery and supplies, run up the
steep dcn.es and sides of the mountains to
the small towns and villages with which
are studded. It was not until the
latter part of 1866 that these people of the
Selinos and Spahkian provinces were
really brought under a semblance of sub
jection to the Ottoman power.
In the latter part of that year Mustapha
Pasha, commanding the Tnrkish forces,
arrived in the island and after issuing a
proclamation promising' concessions to
the Christians and giving 'five days in
which to make their submission, began
operations against them with an army of
some 30,000 men, and after a campaign
which for bloodiness and barbarity stands
almost unriva.ed in the annals of warfare
since the beginning of the Christian era,
by the end or the year bad succeeded iv
restoring temporarily the authority of the
Porte to all of the island except the conn
try of the ? pakiotes in the provinces of
plinos and Spahkia.
In November he attacked and destroyed
the monastery of Arkadi in the province
of Retimo. built during the time of the
Emperor Heraciius, and which had beeh
spared &y every previous foe, even the
Janizaries, There were some 700 persons
within the wails, of whom 250 were com
batants, and the rest women and children.
Forty-two men and ninety women and
children were taken captive. The rest
were killed and butchered under circum
stances of suet horror as to cause a shud
der throughout the civilized world.
The Cretan General Assembly soon
issued another appeal to the Christian
governments, imploring that the three
great protecting powers, England, France
and Russia, aided by America,- would
bring about a prompt intervention and a
cessation of the cruelty and extermina
tion. As in the present instance, di-
P-omacy played double and delayed any
decisive action. The Turkish Govern
ment was induced, however, to allow
foreizn ships of war to carry away the
women and children and such others as
desired to leave the island, and many
were thus sett to Greece. In December,
Mustapha recaptured Kisamos and
advanced his army along the same road
which is now being attempted into the
heart of tne province ot Selinos, driving
the insurgents into the mountains, burn
ing the towns and villages over the heads
of the defenseless women and children.
Murder, fire and rapine went with him
along the way to Spahkia. Every one
able to move fled before him. At Tripiti
over 10CO terror-stricken refugees col
lected and managed to communicate with
the captain of the Russian frigate Grand
Admiral, which was cruising, off the
coast, and he stood in to rescue them. A
Turkish frigate warned him to observe the
The San Francisco Call
blockade and not communicate with the
insurgents, bu: without avail. This was
regarded by the friends of Crete as an act
of intervention, especially as public sym
pathy in Russia, from the Emperor and
bis household down, was with the suffer
ing and struggling Cretans.
Russia, with France, Prussia and Italy,
in June, 1867, urged upon the Poite a ces
sation of hostilities and an inquiry into
the Cretan grievances by a commission
appointed jointly by the great powers and
the Porte, to which Turkey refused to
agree, and later a more ureent note was
a-idreÂ«?d the Porte on the subject. Eng
land and Austria contented t::emseives
with a recommendation to the Porte to
grant liberal concessions to the Cretans.
Turfcey did nothing at all in the matter.
The Russian Government declared in a
circular that while it would not adopt an
isolated course of aciion it was determined
to perform its duty to humanity. The
war went on. In April, 1?67, Omar Pasha
was appointed to the chief command, and
with an army of 15.000 men marched
| against Epahkia, the stronghold of the
insurgents, only to meet with defeat at
the bands of 8000 Cretans. Another expe
dition against Spahkia and Apokorama
with 25,000 men was likewise repulsed.
The atrocious barbarizes of the Turkish
troops daring this time caused all the for
, eign Consuls to report them to their
Governments, and at the instance of the
latter Omar Pasha was directed in Sep
: tember to suspend operations for four
weeks and grant a general amnesty. The
Grand Vizier, Ali Pasha, reached Crete in
October and proclaimed the amnesty
i himself. The Cretan leaders, however,
protested aeainst it and demanded an in
ternational commission of inquiry, so
again nothing was accomplished.
Throughout the rest oi I*^7 and 1868 the
Turks, with an army of 50.000 men, con
tented themselves with holding the forti
fied town, Candia, Retimo, Canea, Ksa
mos and a few other places on the north
ern coast and a chain of block houses run
ning from Canea south to the plain of
Amalo and Luiana, while the Cretans,
with an army of 12,000,,.men held the rest
of the country.
Toward the close of 1568 events occurred
which involved the settlement of the Cre
tan question with other interests and the
end of the insurrection was at hand.
The Cretan Assembly vored for annexa
tion with Greece and sent deputies to rep
resent their country in the GrÂ«"ek Parlia
. ment. They were cordiaily welcomed, but
the Turkish Minister protested, and the i
representatives of the other powers
supporting him, the deputies were
not received. The manifestations of
sympathy for Crete on the part of
tue Grecians, however, continued and the
Turkish Government sent an ultimatum j
to Athens which was rejected. The great I
powers hastened to prevent the threatened >
trouble. A conference was called and met
at Paris, January 9, 1869. England and
Austria took part with those who had at
tempted to intervene between Turkey and
Crete in IS6T. All agreed that the delib
erations should be confined to the matters
between Tuskey and Greece ouly and that
if they could not effect a settlement the
other countries would observe the strictest
neutrality and in case of war between
those two powers the rest of Europe would
â  be simple spectaors.
The result of the conference was that
having no prospect of support Greece was
compelled to accept the settlement pro- |
posed and observe a strict neutrality be
tween Turkey and Crete. Thus cut off !
from the only support they had in the .
way of sympathy and supplies, to say
nothing of recruits, of whom several thou
sand- bad gone to Crete, the revolution in
â  the little island gradually died out, Tne
Greek Patriarch addressed a letter to the
: Christians in Crete and in February the
leaders submitted and in March the
I trouble was at ar. end and the Porte re
â  opened all the ports of Crete.
In spite of their terrible and disastrous
experience of thirty years ago. the spirit
: of independence and the desire for free
â  dem from Turkish rule and lor annexation
: to Greece has again broken forth. The same
tactics as before are being pursued. The
Cretans are harassing their oppressors
and the Turks are shelling and burning
the villages, tne helpless and innocent
suffering alike with the others. Greece is
again manifesting her sympathy and is
. backed up by the Christian people of
1 Albania, who have never been well dis
â  posed toward the Mussulman masters. If
the powers stand aloof in any trouble that
may arise Crete, Greece and Albania wi.l
do much toward settling the Eastern ques
! tion and changing the boundaries of
European Turkey.
Crete, or Candia, as it s often called,
has an area, including the smaller islands
with which it is surrounded, of about 3300
square miles. Its population is about
300,000, of whom 220,000 are Greek Catho
lics and the rest Mussulman. The capi
tal. Canea, with Retimo and Candia, are
the only cities of any size on the island,
having together a population of some
42.000. There are a number of towns of
from 500 to 2500 peouie, mainly alone the
co&--t, and about 1000 villages. The island
has had an eventful history- At the cap
ture of Constantinople by the Latins in
; 1204 it fell to the lot of the Marquis of
Montocrat, who sold it to the Venetians,
' wno held it until 1669. when, after a seige
; of twenty years, the Turks captured Can-
I dia, the last stronghold of the Venetians,
and became the masters of the whole
is and. Their rule was an iron one, and
: the people groaned under it til.
when, taking advantage of the revolution
i in continental Greece, they tried to gain
; their independence. They drove the
1 Turks into the fortified towns, and the
> war dracged on till 1830, when England,
j France and Russia, having intervened be
! tween Turkey and Greece, transferred
! Crete to the Government of Egypt, where
| it remained till 1840, when it was again re
! turned to the Turks.
In 1830 the Cretans made another revolt,
! but it was short-Mved and unsuccesÂ«ful.
Another effort in 1866 lasted three years,
with fair promise of success, when out
side influence brought it to an end, as
shown.

WITH RAZOR AND FIRE.
1 Lunatic Frank Canon Attempts to Murder
Mrs Parents and Cremate Their
Bodies.
IOWA FALLS, lowa, July 27.â Frank
P. Carson, in a nt of insanity, attempted
| to cut tbe throats of hit' aged. father and
| mother and then opened his own neck, at
their home in this city at an early hour
this morning. Before beginning his work
the maniac had started a fire in a trunk
filled with combustibles in his own room
upstairs, with the evident intention of
cremating the bodies of his intended vic
tims.
The weapon used was a razor, with
which he first attacked his father, but only
succeeded in making a slight flesh wound
on the neck. He caught his mother and
drew the razor across her neck, cutting a
deep gash from the ear to the middle of
â¢the neck. The lunatic then cut his own
throat from ear to ear, partially severing
! the windpipe, but is still living, though
i the surgeon considers his recovery impos
â¢ sible. The mother is in a precarious con
i dition through loss of blood and nervous
prostration, but hopes are entertained of
her recovery. The maniac was but re
cently discharged from the asylum at In
dependence as cured.
KIDNAPED TWO CHILDREN.
Mrs. Lizzie Thompson of Cincinnati Causes
a Sensation at Louisville by Steal
ing Her Offspring.
LEXINGTON. K.Y., July 27.â A sensa
tion was created this morning when it be
came known that Mrs. Lizzie Thompson
of Cincinnati, who separated from her hus
band, Harry B. Thompson, two years ago,
had returned to the city Saturday night
and had kidnaped their two children. The
children â Nellie Milton, aged 10, and John
8.. aged Bâlived8 â lived with their grandparents
and were on the way to Sunday-school
when picked up by Mrs. Thompson, who
was in a closed carriage. After securing
the children the mother went to the home
of their teacher and left a note directed to
Dr. Ward, pastor of Christ Church, telling
what had been done. It is believed she
drove to some station on the Cincinnati
Southern, where she boarded the train for
Cincinnati.

LEADERS CLOSELY aUESTIOHED
Joseph Asbury Johnson Secures ao
Admission That the Maine
Man Is Not Wanted.
KANSAS CITY, Ma, July 27.-I re- j
same my report on the results of the Popu
list convention at St. Louis wnile we wait '
an hour for our train to California. I may
add that we are all well, and even the
middle-of-the-road growlers are now in
good spirits, as they begin to realize that
there is after all a chance for an honest
deal and a genuine union of the silver and
reform forces.
The grounds of this growing confidence
will fairly indicate the practical outcome
of the stormy and unprecedented conven
tion which named its own Vice-Presi-
Jential candidate and nominated the
Presidential candidate of the Democracy.
In the first place, the alliance with the
Democracy was made possible only by the
nomination of a Southern Populist for the
Vice-Presidency. On no other terms
would or could a Southern Populist con
sent to nominate Bryan, and without the
Southern Populists his nomination was
clearly impossible.
I have made a thorough canvass of the
representatives from the four States of
lowa. Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado, in
cluding General Weaver, the recognized
and "official" leader of the Bryanized Popu
lists who worked and fought for the nom
ination of Sewall as well as Bryan. I
have been insistent on this one point:
"Will you men who voted and stood for
Sewall as well as Bryan consent or to per
mit the withdrawal cf Watson in favor of
Sewall?" I get the same emphatic an
swer, variously expressed: "Never, under
no conditions" that may arise, can such a
thing be done. Watson is the nominee of
the Populist convention and the unani
mous choice, too."
Early on Bunday morning, the day
after the convention adjourned, I saw
Senator Allen, the chairman of the con
vention and a strong Bryan and Sewall
man. We met at the Hotel Lindell, and I
asked him to talk for publication in The
Call, and to give me a frank and open an
swer to this question :
'â¢Do you favor the withdrawal of Wat
son and the support of Sewall as the Vice-
Presidential candidate?"
His answer was emphasized oy gesture
and tone, and he said :
"Not for a moment. It is impossible and
eqnahy undesirable. * We cannot elect
Bryan without the Southern vote and that
is lost if they are asked to support Sewall.
Bat there fs yet another reason. Watson
is the unanimous nominee of the Populist
\ convention, and we cannot break faith
i with our Southern brothers. Igo farther.
This wbole matter is now in the hands of
Mr. Sewall. He alone can open the way
to a complete union of the silver forces.
You say for me that I have assurances
whicn command my confidence that Mr.
Sewali could not be induced to remain in
the field as a candidate. He will decline
this Democratic nomination as a patriot
who sincerely desires a compact and hon
est union of the silver forces. He cannot
afford to remain in the held and divide the
forces."
While making this emphatic declara
tion J. H. ("Cycione") Davis, the leader
: of the Texas and Southern Populists, ap
proached us, and I at once questioned
him. in the presence of Senator Allen, as
to the attitude of the Southern people.
He spoke in a tone of calm assurance, and
said that the South would cordially sup
port Bryan and Watson, but under no cir
cumstances would they accept Sewall. I
j asked him if he believed the Populist sup
' porters of Sewall would now torn to Wat
j son and support him as cordially as they
i would have supported Sewall. He and
â  Allen exchanged glances and he said: "I
i have not a single doubt of it. They are
: all Watson men now. Is not that so,
Senator Allen?" The response came
; promptly as a fact beyond question:
"They are all Watson men. They can
j not support Sewali."
Immediately afterward I met Mr. Breid
i enthal of Kansas, one of Sewali's most ar
dent supporters, in a group of men from
â  Nebraska ana lowa. I said:
"Mr. Breidenthai, who is your candidate
for the Vice-Presidency?"
He smiled and replied : "The conven
tion settled that question for all Popu-
I lists. We are bound by it to support Tom
Watson, and I am now glad of it Mr.
Sewall is a patriot. He will not accept
the Democratic nomination. He cannot,
lin honor, be a candidate. Watson is our
\ man, and I shall support him with all my
i heart."
And so I might go on and qnote Judge
| Hines of Georgia, S. M. Owens of Min
| nesota. State chairman of the lowa Pop
' ulists, and a dozen others from the North.
: In each case I should have to record the
same answer. In fact. I have not found a
, single man who favored the nomination
of Sewall who will now support him as
; against Watson.
At this point I should state that I had a
decisive taiK with Senator Allen on his
assertion at the Jefferson Club meeting
j early in the session of the convention that
| those who od posed the nomination of

and said: "That is not wnat I said. It

1 do not believe that any straight Popu
list received a cent or the promise of one
from Mr. Hanna or his agents. I know
them too well and trust them too im
plicitly. But that would not shield tLem
from the slanderous charges. I warned
them on that point, that w*s all."
My time is up, and I must rush for my
train. To-morrow I may have more to
say. Joseph Asbcbt Johssos.

It Is 2>tee**ary to Harmonise AH the
(filter Element*.
BT. LOUIS, Mo., July 27.â With the
exception of several members of the
executive committee of the Popu
list and Silver parties delegates to last
week's conventions have returned to their
homes. Senator Butler of South Carolina,
"Cyclone" Davi3 of Texas, Morton C. Ran
kin of Indiana, Dr. Mott o* North Caro
lina, General J. B. Weaver of lowa and
H. E. Taubeneck of Illinois are the most
prominent of those remaining.
Senator JoneS is expected to return
from his visit to Bryan at Lincoln, Nebr.,
to-morrow, when he will meet Senator
Butler and the Populist committee. After
the conference it is likely that Senator
Bu:ler will Limself visit Lincoln. After
that be will go to Washington to visit the
Populist leader?, with a view to blocking
out the work of the campaign.
It is believed the Senator's chief aim
just now is to secure, if possible, the with
drawal ot Sewall from second place on the
ticket. The Popuibt chairman believes
that the Democratic Vice - Presidential
nominee owes it to the cause of silver to
get out of the race, and it i? said he is of
the opinion that he can be induced to get
off the ticket.
Such a move, in Senator Butler's
opinion, would harmonize all the silver
elements North and South, and would
especially aid the cause in Tennessee,
North Carolina, Alabama and Texas,
where the Populists have been gaining
strength fof the last four years.
Besides the substitution of Watson for
Sewall on the ticket. Senator Butler wants
the Populists represented on Senator
Jones' National Committee which is to
handle the camcaijin. The headquarters
he wants located either at Washington or
Chicago, and his preference is for tne lat
ter city as it is in the heart of the de
batable territory.

INDIANAPOLIS, lira., July 26.â The
Populist State Convention will be very
slimly attended, about 100 of the 900 dele
gates having put in an appearance. The
Democrats are making strenuous efforts to
get an indorsement of their State ticket
by having the nations put in the
hand of a committee, with power to act
and adjourn the convention.
To-night a long conference of the dele
gates was held, lasting until midnight, but
no action was taken. The tenor of the
talk, however, was in favor of nominating
the State ticket and placing the matter of
putting an electoral ticket in the field in
the hands of a committee. Whether this
will be done ;is doubtful, for the State
committee is very anxious that the whole
thing should be placed in its hands and is
working Card to that end, backed by all
; the pressure the Demoaratic leaders can
; bring to bear. Mr. Sbiveley, the Demo
cratic nominee, this evening stated that
he would not decline the support of the
Populitts if they should nominate him.'
WILLIAMS DECLARES WAR.
BW Pleated With the Chilly Enthviiasm
for the Chicago Ticket.
BOSTON, Mass., July 27.â George Fred
Williams will, to-morrow, declare political
war on the Democratic State organization.
The action of the State committee in re
fusing to indorse the Chicago platform and
the nominees of the convention, Bryan and
Sewatl, leaves them no alternative, says
MrÂ»Williams and his friends. Mr. Williams
is not taking much stock in some of the
party leaders in this State who are saying,
"Oh, yes, of course, we are for the ticket."
This sort of enthusiasm does not suit Mr.
Williams. To his mind it is damning the
ticket with this faint praiseâ more danger
ous he thinks than an open enemy. The
National ticket must receive hearty,
earnest, enthusiastic support by the Slate
organization, he says, and in order to do
this a committee in full accord with the
ticket nominated at Chicago must be
chosen. _^_^_____^_^_

Armed Men Intent on Meting Venge*
ance Are Seeking for the
Assassin.
NEVADA CITY, Cal., July 27.â The
lone toll-taker of the North San Juan
road is dead. Nevada County has been
rid of a desperado, but the rejoicing at its
deliverance is palled by grief over the loss
of one of the bravest officers in ail Cali
fornia. The body of Sheriff David F.
Douglass was found this mornirg near
that of the outlaw for whom posses had
searched in vain for weeks. He had "got
his man," but lost his life. A cowardly
bullet had closed the career of this fearless
officer â a bullet fired when his back was
turned to the assassiD as the Sheriff
faced the read agent who now lies cold in
death.
To-night armed men are scouring the
country for miles around, eager to avenge
the death of Sheriff Douglass. Should
his slayer be captured no mercy will be
shown. Never have the people of Nevada
County been so aroused over a criminal
act. Scores of men, some almost frenzied
in their rage, others cool and cautious,
but all bent upon the same purrose, are
searching every hillside and gully. Thefy
make no attempt to conceal their inten
-1 tion to mete death swiftly to the mur
derer if he is taken. A suspicious char
acter named Johnson was arrested to
night, but he is not believed to be the
right man.
Smarting under the failure of posses to
; run down the road agent who has com
, mitted repeated robberies in this vicinity
of late, Sheriff Douglass had started yes
terday to attempt bis capture single
( banded. He came across the outlaw near
the city. Evidently the fellow was asleep.
When Douglass called to him he reached
for bis rifle, which lay by his side, but the
Sheriff was too quick and the outlaw wa3
> slain before he could fire. Then a confed
erate of the toll-taker, attracted by tne
\ shots, appeared and fired at the Sheriff's
back. Douglass fell near the body of the
man he had slain and his death must
have been instantaneous. A bullet from
the assassin's rifle had broken his back.
Within the past two weeks numerous)
i highway robberies have occurred in this
i vicinity. Recently Detective Thomas Gib
i son and Charles Sladky, of San Francisco,
were halted and robbed by a lone road
agent while coming to this city from North
San Juan. Other persons were held up on
the same day. Since then four or five
. robberies have been committed, evidently
' all by the same outlaw, judging from the
, description given by his victims.
Word was brought to the Sheriff's office
on Saturday that a man supposed to be
the robber was seen within a half mile of
' town. Sheriff Douglass, Under Sheriff
Pascoe and two other men went out to
j look for him. They found his track and
followed it for some distance, but then
lost it. The bloodhound '-Jim Budd" was
taken out, but, owing to the thick growth
j of the tarweed at one point the dog lost
; the scent and was unable to work. At
! nightfall the officers returned to town.
Sheriff Douglass received information
late at night that fresh tracks had been
discovered in the neighborhood of what is
called the Cold Spring, near Wells' mile
ranch, less than two miles from town. Hs
' surmised they were made by the road
: agent and concluded the fellow might be
| camped near there. Yesterday forenoon
i the Sheriff drove in a buggy to a point a
i half mile from town, tied his horse and
struck out through the woods to look for
j the man. The horse and buggy were nd-
I ticed there all afternoon and they were
I still there this morning. A man living in
j that neighborhood wno saw the rig came
j to town and gave the information to the
I Sheriff's office.
Suspicion was at once aroused and DepÂ«
uty Sheriff Neagle and Martin McGrath
left town on horseback without delay.
Neagle had beard the Sheriff say he be*
lieved the robber was camped near the
spring, so they went there direct. When
near the spot they saw the body of a man
lying on the ground. Approaching cau
tiously they found that the man was dead,
and not ten feet from him was a second,
body. The one was Sheriff Douglass cold
in death and the -other was a stranger.
Neagle remained with the bodies and
McGrath returned to town to get help and
spread the terrible news. Douglass had
fallen on his face. He was shot twice,
both bullets entering from behind. One
bullet entered the right side of his back,
ranging upward, striking a vital part,
passing throug.ii the vertebrae and coming
out on the right side. The other buiies
passed through his right hand. There
was a wound in the right eye, received in
falling. He had fired five shots from his
revolver.
The robber's coat was under his head
and bis arms were spread over a Win
chester rifle. He, too, received two bullets,
both ranging downward. One bullet
passed tnrough the heart and came out at
the hip. The other entered the right side
of the abdomen, coming out above the hip.
The rifle had not been fired for some time.
The theory is that the road agent was
lying down when Douglass came on to
him, and, while reaching for his rifle, was
shot by the Sheriff, who was an expert
with a pistol. The fact that Douglass was
shot from behind convinced the officers
that a third person fired the shots that
killed the Sheriff and that the murderej2
was a partner in crime of the man whom
Douglass killed. A brush tent occupied
by the men was found near the scene of
the tragedy.
The bodies of tbe men were brought to
town and taken to an undertakers.
Robert Latta, who was stopped the same
day Policeman Gibson and Sladky were
robbed, near the same place and by the
same man, identifies the dead stranger as
the highwayman who stopped him. The
man did not wear a mask while commit
ting the robberies, and identification is
easy. He has been operating in this sec
tion for Rome time, begging food Iroin fam
ilies on the outskirts of town and asking to
have lunches put up before leaving, claim
ing that he was going on a long journey.
This extra food was probably for his part
ner, who kept out of 6igbt. M. L. Marsh,
a lumberman, says the man went to work
at his mill on May 25 and worsed fnur
days. He gave his name as C. Meyers.
Under Sheriff Pa6coe, who went out this
morning to seÂ«rch for Sheriff Douglass,
had not returned at 11 o'clock to-night,
and grave fears are entertained that he
may have been ambushed and slain. A
large posÂ«e has been formed to search him.
Ifcis hardly probable that Pascoe would
have remained out so long if something
had not happened. He Is a son of the late
W. H. Pascoe, who was killed by Freder
icks three years ago, while Sheriff of this
county.
Dr. Tricknell conducted a post-mortem
examination over the bodies of Sheriff
Douglass and the outlaw to-uight. He
said the men had been dead fifteen hours.
The rifle used by the robber was stolen
from Grant Dart of Rough and Ready,
eight miles from here. The dead robber
worked for two days at Marsh's sawmill
la this town, and also worked for two days
at Lord's livery stable in Grass Valley,
four miles from here. He was seen in
this dty last Friday evening. He drank
heavily. On Saturday a barber shaved
him. No one identified him then as the
toll-taker.
The murderer of Sheriff Douglass had
robbed both bis victim and the dead out
law or all their valuables. The pockets of
their clothing had been turned inside out
and everything they contained removed.
David F. Douglass was about 40 years of
ajre, and his father for the past twenty-five
years has been the agent and confidential
messenger of Wells, Fargo & Co. at Nevada
City. The murdered man had been a
messenger in the employ of the express
company. He was Deputy Sheriff under
the late Sheriff Pascoe, who was killed
about three years ago, and upon the
latter's death Douglass was appointed
Sheriff by the Supervisors of Nevada
County. At the last election, although a
Democrat, the citizens of Nevada County,
mostly Republicans, thought so highly of
him that they elected him Sheriff again by
a large majority. Douglass was married
ani Lad several children.
Douglass was known as an utterly fear
less man. A short time ago when gam
blers and criminals of ail kinds were run
ning things with a high hand in Truckee
and Nevada City Douglass determined to
put a stop to it. He said he had taken
tbe oath of office to keep the peace of that
county and he proposed to do it, even if he
lost his life in the attempt. He went right
in among the gamblers of Truckee and by
arresting the ringleaders he showed he
was not afraid of the hard citizens who in
fested the town. It was not very long be
fore Truckee was lreed from all the crim
inal cla ses and everything was peaceful.
The same state of affairs existed in Ne
vada City after Douglass started in on his
reform.
Sheriff Douglass was a prominent Na
tive Son. His parents and six brothers
and two sisters are still living, and he is
survived by a widow and a young son,
who were in San Francisco when :he news
of the officer's death wa3 received.
DOUGLASS KNEW NO FEAR.
Ex- Sheriff O'Neill of Sacramento Tell* of j
Hi* friend* Brarery.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., July 27 "I have
been acquainted with Dave Douglass for
years," said ex-Sheriff Tom O'Neill of Sac
ramento County to a Call representative
to-night. "We were warm personal
friends. His death has been a severe
shock to me and yet it was by no means
unexpected, for I knew his fearlessness
but too well. We have traveled together,
paten and slept on the trace of criminals
we were pursuing, and although I have 1
always felt that Dave was a good man to I
have with you when danger was abroad, I
always believed tnftt his absolute disre
pard of danger would at any time over
come his real sense, for he was a man ab
solutely devoid of fear. During our
pursuit of Fredericks, shortly after the
Killing of Sheriff Pascoe, Dave and I spent
severel days together in the brush in Yuba
Count}-, and my admiration of the man
was increased a hundred fold. Dave was
a man who, as I before said, being abso
lutely devoid of fear, would always give
any criminal the long end of it."
"I suppose, now that Donglass is dead,
young Pascoe, the son of Sheriff Pascoe
whom Fredericks killed, will be made
Sheriff. He was a deputy under
Douglass."
To Identify the Ifead Outlaw.
Chief Crowley received a dispatch yes
terday from District Attorney P. T. Riiey,
asking him to send Policeman T. B. Gib
aon to see if he could identify the dead
highway man at Nevada City. Gibson left
by the overland train last evening.
Gibson and his friend, Charles Sladky,
were held up in Droad daylight by a high
wayman, who covered them with a W'.n
chester and robbed them, on July 16.
They were spending a brief vacation in
Nevada County. The highwayman did
not take the trouble to wear a mask, so
both Gibson and 81adky had a good took
at him.
RESIGN ATIONS REQUESTED.
Three Vseltss United States Consuls Are
Called Home.
WASHINGTON, D. C. July 17.â While
the State Department has not yet received
the resignations of three consuls that were
cabled for recently, there is no longer any
secret that Edward P. C. Hammond of
Budapest, Marshall P. Thatcher of Wind
sor, Ontario, and Henry C. Smith at San
tos, Brazil, will be promptly forthcoming.
The coincidence ' in , these resignations
being called for just at the present , time
is entirely accidental. They are located
outside the districts recently inspected
with a view to ; Improving the service.
The. requests for the resignations are due
to complaints coming from the respective
posts. None of them has rendered satis
factory service since his appointment.

BRYAN IS NOT

Willing to Accept if Only

Chance.
OUT WITH A STATEMENT
But His Feelings Are Deftly
Concealed in Peculiar
Platitudes.
TO ACT WITH DELIBERATION,
Meanwhile tbe Nebraska Candidate
Appeals to Friends to Withhold
Hasty Criticism-
LINCOLN". Nebb., July 27.â The result
of the conference last evening between
Senator Jones and Mr. Bryan has not yet
become apparent. From wbat Senator
' Jones said just before he left Lincoln it is
t inferred that no definite plan was ar
' ranged to bring about an understanding
j with reference to tbe Democratic and
I Populist National tickets. Wbat Mr.
Bryan thinks about the absolute refusal
of Mr. Watson to withdraw from the sec
ond place on the Populist 'ticket cannot be
ascertained. Mr. Bryan declined to-night
to discuss specifically that or any other
matter relating to the situation. His feel
ings with regard to the complicated situa
tion caused by Watson's nomination are
exercised generally, however, in the fol
lowing authoritative statement made pub
lic to-night.
"Mr. Bryan received a number of tele
grams during the day containing sugges
tions in regard to the action of the Popu
list convention. He has replied to all
that he will act with deliberation and that
nothing will be done which can be justly
criticized by those who are interested in
bimetallism. He begs all friends of the
cause in all parties to refrain from harsh
criticism of those who, however much
they may differ, agree in desiring the im
mediate restoration of free coinage. He
feels sure that a solution of ail difficulties
will be found in due time and that the so
lution will be honorable to all parties, as
well as satisfactory."
It was understood that Senator Stewart
of Nevada would be in Lincoln to-day on
his way home from the Populist conven
tion, but he did not put in an appearance.
Congressman Newlands of Nevada, who,
according to tne dictionary, is the only
"Silverite" in the House, arrived to-night
and, after seeing Mr. Bryan, took a train
for Washington. Senator Pettigrew, who
followed the lead of Senator Teller in
bolting the Republican convention, is ex
pected in Lincoln to-morrow or next day.
Several delegates- to the Populist conven
tion are in Lincoln to-day and sailed on
Mr. Bryan. Governor Holcomb has re
turned from St. Louis. He brought a
unique present for Mr. and Mrs. Bryan
from tbe Kansas to the
Populist conventionâ two beautiful birds
of tbe species known as love birds. Mrs.
Bryan has named them Kansas and Ne
braska.
SOUND MONEY DEMOCRATS.

CHICAGO, 111., July 27.â The sound
money Democrats received many letters
and telegrams to-day from several States
assuring General Bragg and hie executive
committee that State organization would
be pushed and National committeemen
selected. News of an encouraging nature
was said to have been received from
Indiana, of which much has been ex
pected, but little has been received from
the party leaders.
The executive committee (received a
telegram from Kufus Bandy, chairman of
the Texas Sound Money League, stating
that Texas would name its National com
mitteeman Saturday next.
A telegram from Judge H. 8. Simms of
Huntington, W. Va., a leading Democrat,

Virginia Democrats would organize Wed
. nesday and select their committeeman.

lawyer, who has been leading the sound
money movement there since the conven
tion, and who was asked by the committee
to organize Pennsylvania, telegraphed his
consent to serve and stated that a National
committee member would be named in
time.
Lynde Harrison of New Haven, Conn.,
wired a similar acceptance on behalf of
His State. He was a delegate at large to
the Chicago convention.
Euclid Martin, National cominitteeman
I for Nebraska, telegraphed that Bryan
would soon discover that his State was yet
to be conquered by the silver forces.
News from Baltimore showed a strong
development of sentiment there for an
other ticket, although the first sentiment
among the .party leaders had been in op
position.
Samuel Kimble of Manhattan, Kans.,
informed the committee that arrange
ments were in progress for a State organi
zation and that a member of the National
Committee would be named to attend the
meeting.
A. B. Kassell of Harriman,.Tenn., Bays:
"1 believe that an honest ticket will poll
a large number of votes, even in our own
county which is strongly silver. The
Democracy is evenly divided between free
silver and honest money with nearly all
the Republicans in favor At the latter."
LINCOLN, Nkbr., July 27.â United
States District Attorney Sawyer, w^o re
turned to-day from a visit with Secretary
Morton at Nebraska City, announced that
there is no longer any question but that
Nebraska sour.d money Democrats will
nominate a Btate ticket, whether a Na
tional convention is held or not. A meet
ing is called for Omaha some day this

AUGUSTA, Me., July 27.â a letter to
Hon. A. J. Staples of this city, President
Hyde of Bowdoin College who is a Demo
crat, announces that he shall vote the Re
publican ticket. He gives his reasons as
follows :
"The maintenance of financial integ

promotion of civil service reform, the pres

which contracts have been made by which
savings are secured and in which labor is

CLEVELEND'S PROPHECY.
Year* Ago He Sa%e the Certain.- Destruc-
tion of Party Hope*.
JACKSON, Miss., July 27.â The follow
ing was given out to-night by Edgar 8.
Wilson, who was private secretary to Mr.
Lamar when be was Senator:
In May, 1892, several months before
Mr. Cleveland was nominated for Presi
dent at Chicago he wrote the late Judge
L. Q. C. Lamar a letter, the original of
which is now preserved in this city.
The letter was in reply to one from
Judge Lamar, written in pencil on a sick
bed from which he never arose. Wbat
was prophecy then is history now. Tbe
letter is dated at Lakeview, N. J., May 1,
1892, and after congratulating Mr. Lamar
on his reported improvement says:
"Forces are at work which certainly
mean the complete turning back of the
hamlÃof the dial of Democracy and the
destruction of party hopes- Is it ordained
that lam to be tt.e instrument by which
Democratic principles can be saved,
whether party supremacy immediately
awaits us or not?
"If folly is to defeat us in any event
ought I to be called upon to place myself
under the falling timber? I sbail be obe
dient to the cause of my country and my
party. Whatever happens no one shall
say that I refused to serve in time of need
or abandoned those who have been instru
mental in calling me to the neld when is
waged the battle for Democratic princi
ples.
"If I am given my discharge I shall
thank God mo.it fervently. I can easily
be disposed of, either by the selection of a
candidate more available or by the adop
tion of a campaign policy on the financial
question, which I am not willing to fur
ther.
"In the first case I shall be a happy
helper; in tbe second, I shall sadly await
the announcement of party defeat, which
will be predetermined.
"Our Southern friends, if they persist,
will be left alone with their free-coinage
heresy. The danger is that another
Southern idea and a charge of heedless
ness for the public safetj- on the financial
question will do service in the place of the
memories of the Civil War.
"The question is often and justifiably
put, my friendly Southerners: 'Can
Cleveland carry New York?' The answer
is ready a* to Cleveland or any other man
if the Democracy is at all weak on the
coinage question.
"As one who loves his country and be
lieves that her interest is bound up in
Democratic supremacy I am most uncom
fortable and unhappy in the fear that the
South will not see until too late the dan
ger of their marring all.
"If I should read this I hardly should
â end it, but it goes laden with affection
and tbe most tender memories. Yours
affectionately, Gbovcr Clxvklahd."
REPUBLICANS ARE ACTIVE.
Leader* Preparing to Make a Most rig

CHICAGO, 111.. July IT.â The Ohio Re
publican campaign managers are â  count
ing on the consent of Major McKinley to
assist in opening the battle in that State
at Columbus, August 12. National Com
mitteeman Charles L. . Kurtz, who is also
chairman of the State Committee, an
nounced such expectations when he called
to-day at Republican campaign head
quarters. ,He came to Chicago specially
to get some spectacular extras for the
campaign opening. He has no promise
from the Major yet, but considering it is
Ohio the manager believes â an exception
will be made in its favor. v
"There : is a surprising demand â¢ for cur
rent literature Irom Ohio," said Mr. Kurtz
to a United: Press reporter, "and I â¢ have
asked the campaign committee to fill this
demand as soon as possible. ; The farmers
want literature on the ; questions of the
day and, within the last ten days there has
been a change of sentiment toward sound
money. The tariff is being 'discussed
more in the cities, among the discon
tented, and that is the question which
should be brought prominently; forwagi
in cities as the . campaign â  talk. I have
asked; for tariff literature to be circulated
in the cities."
Congressmen Hopkins and Belknap and
] Senator Cullom came to headquarters
with reports from Illinois that sound
money was getting the upper hand in the
agricultural regions. While recognizing
the necessity of meeting the attacks of
I the silver foe, they urge that the speakers
sent from headquarters should not get
away from discussion of protection in re
lation to the farm, the mine and wages.

o'clock this morning at his suburban
home in Lake Forest, aged 62. He had
been in poor health for several months
and recently suffered an attack of pneu
monia. He failed in vitality afterward,
and heart disease, which followed, was
the immediate cause of death.
The intelligence of Mr. Smith's death
was a surprise to his friends, as the mem
bers of his family did not become alarmed
until last Sunday, when a consultation of
physicians was held. The symptom of
approaching death was made manifest
Sunday immediately after the deceased
had spent a restful day. At his bedside,
in addition to the physicians, were Delevan

William* married the only daughter of
Mr. Smith, and she died last fall. Mr.

New York, December 1, 1833, bis ancestors
beine a mixture of English, Scotch and
Dutch. His father, William de Forest
Smith, was of English origin. His an
cestors came to America in 1640, and his
parents moved to Ohio, where he had ex
cellent educational advantages. He
adopted teaching in a Western college,
and afterward became an editor of a Cin
cinnati paper. At 22 Mr. Smith was editor
and also did work for the Literary Review.
He was engaged on the Cincinnati Ga
zette during the war; helped to raise
troops and supplies and strengthened the
Government by political work. He was
mainly instrumental in making John
Brough Governor of Ohio, afterward be
coming the Governor's secretary and Sec
retary of State for the terms 1564-66. From
that office Mr. Smith became managing
editor of the Chronicle, retiring on account
of ill health, and in 1870 became manager
of the Western Associated Press, with
headquarters here. President Hayes ap
pointed him Collector of the Fort In

ISOLATED MINING CAMPS.
Their Supplies Cut Off by the Recent
Colorado Cloudbursts.
DENVER, Colo., July 27.â As a sequel
to the series of cloudbursts there is a new
and serious trouble confronting the people.
It will take a month or even more for the
railroads reaching several of the most im
portant milliner camps to make sufficient
repairs to enable tbej-unningot trains.
All of these camps depend on Denver
for their daiiy supply of provisions and
stocks. General depopulation of the towns
and a suspension of mining operations
until such time as the railroads are able
to care for the requirements of the resi
dents is not improbable.
On Saturday "the second cloudburst over
took several teams that had been sent into
the foothills for the purpose of bringing in
the bodies of tbe dead, and it was only by
shouldering corpses that the searchers suc
ceeded in regaining the lower level.

Asianlani, who succeeded in getting to
America several years ago, but the Turkish
authorities refused them passports. Just
before they started for this country they
witnessed some of the horrors of the
slaughter of the Christian Armenians by
the Turks, and were themselves subjected
to insult and danger.
Vanderbilt's Condition.
NEWPORT, R. 1., July 27.â A visit to

bring forth an official announcement as to
Mr. Vanderbilt's condition as Dr. McLane
was out driving. No word had been left

callers during the day, but it was generally
understood about the place that the sick
man had passed a good niirht and that his

JOIN THE CONTRACTORS.
Peculiar Arrangement Growing
Out of the Strike of the
Tailors.
There Is Now a United Demand Upon
the Manufacturers for Higher
Prices.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 27.â With
this, the beginning of the second week of
the tailors' strike,tbe workmen find them
| selves for the first time in the history of
i the unions in alliance with the contractors
I against the manufacturers. What little
concealment of this situation there was
yesterday was entirely cast aside to-day,
and even the contractors themselves ad
! mitted they nad committees scurrying
i around about town to get all the contrac
i tors to come in and unite in a demand
I upon the manufacturers for higher prices.
They based their demand upon the con
tract submitted by the striking tailors,
which calls for higher wages and shorter
hours for the coming year.
,V.lt was the opinion of tbe contractors
that it would be the end of the week be
fore the demands of the contractors would
be presented to the manufacturers. Unless
the latter acquiesced the contractors could
not agree to the terms ' proposed <by the
tailors.
Two hundred and fifty youne women,
members of the United Garment-workers'
Union in Brooklyn, went out on strike
this morning. They were in sympathy
with the Wiiliamsburg tailors.
As a result of a conference between a
committee of the strikers and a committee
of .the contractors to-day" the Brotherhood
of Tailors will defer indefinitely treating
with the contractors as individuals, it hav
ing been agreed to give the contractors an
opportunity to induce ail the non-union
contractors to join their association and
ignore for the present all those who wish
| to sign the contract as individuals.

&BABOXESS " niiAWfO AGAIN.
About to Bring Suit for Divorce From
Her Fottrth Husband.
NEW YORK, N.Y., July 27.â The "Ba
roness" Blanc appears to be in trouble
again. According to well-defined rumors
her fourth matrimonial venture has ended
like the others â in disaster. Since her
secret marriage on June 13 to young
Leeds Vaughan Waters rumors have been
afloat of legal difficulties, in which the
family of the young man are takinc an
aggressive part.
Mrs. Waters, the mother of the young
man, is now in Paris, and it is said the
Waters family is endeavoring to secure an
annulment of the marriage. The "Baron
ess," it is said, stands upon her rights, is
prepared to prove the validity of the mar
riage and i*- determined that if there is a
separation the initiative shall be taken by
her. To this end, it is said, she has in
structed her attorneys to bring proceed
ings for a divorce. This part of the re
port, however, is denied by tne law firm.
Before meeting Waters she had been
married to Alfred Laurence Riegel, Fred
erick N. Blanc and Shirley Onderdonk,
who is said to be still living.

I tests he turned his "horse about and set
I out toward dome. Miss Walworth fol
lowed on her bicycle.

TAKEN FROM THE FORT

Line of Pickets During the
Conference.
FIRST OUTING IN TWO MONTHS
Weyler's Order Prohibiting Exporta
tion of Cuban Fruit Injures
American Merchants.
HAVANA, Cuba, July 27.â The son of
General Lee and two gentlemen from the
American consulate held an interview
with the Competitor prisoners on July 24.
They were not permitted to enter tbe
prison, but the seven men of the Competi
tor were taken outside of the fort to a
guaad house for a conference. General
Lee, being slightly indisposed, was not
able to be there in person.
The prisoners were closely guarded, a
double line of pickets being stationed
around the guardhouse. They had not
been out of their cells for two months.
All appeared to be in fairly good health,
it is understood the review of the Com
petitor case will be taken up in the Su
preme Couit at Madrid some time in
August. Nothing whatever as yet has
been done in the case.
Strenuous efforts are being made by
General Lee on behalf of the Government
against the order of General Weyler pro
hibiting the export of fruit. This prohibi
tion is causing an immense damage to
American commerce and business. The
principal reason for the prohibition of the
export of fruit to certain seaport towns is
that they are virtually under the control
of the rebels.
The Bpanish are not able to station large
bodies of troops at all of these places, nor
are the Cubans able to openly hold the
places on account of the Spanish fleet, but
all the Cubans shipping fruit are in sym
pathy with the rebels and furnish them
with'money.
This order is an indirect blow at the rebel
resources in Cuba, as the prohibition of
the exportation of tobacco was to Ameri
cans.
CUBA'S PRESIDENT.
Groundless Rumor That He Is in Â»tr
Xork City.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 27.â There is
no fouudation for the rumor that Senor
Salvador Cisneros Betancourt, President
of the republic of Cuba, is in New York, or
even coming to the United States at the
present moment. Dr. J aquin Castillo
Duany, the Cuban auD-deiegate, said yes
terday:
"On Saturday evening Senor Estrada
Palma went to Central Valley to spend
Sunday with his family, and he did not
say a word about the President coming.
The news must come from a Spanish
source. Our enemies are now inventing
all sorts of things to destroy tho moral
effect of our unquestionable success. They
report encounter after encounter in which
the patriots are always defeated, and yet
we know that, with few exceptions, the
righting is for the present reduced to mere
skirmishes."

SAVINGS BANK DECISION.
Validity of Rule* Governing Depositors
in Regard to Passbooks.
NEW YORK, N. V., July 27âJudge
Daly, in the appellate term of the Supreme
Court, to-day handed down a decision
which is of interest to every savings bank
depositor in the country. In it he holds
that when a depositor subscribes to the
rules of a savings bank governing deposits,
which rules provide that the presentation
of a bankbook shall be sufficient evidence
of authority to the bank to make any pay
ment to the bearer, such payments shall
be valid wben there is no circumstance in
connection with the passbook to justify
suspicion. The decision is in the case of a
depositor of the Citizens' Savings Bank
against that institution, who had nearly
$10,000 on deposit, and which deposit was
withdrawn by another person, who had
obtained possession of his passbooks.
Judge Daly's decision was on an appeal.
The case had been tried twice in the lower
courts, and in both instances the decision
was in favor of the plaintiff.
BLACK HILLS VOLCANO.
Interesting Discoveries by a Geological
Surveying Party.
ST. PAUL, Minn., July 27.â Professor J.
E. Todd, Stale Geologist of South Dakota,
who recently left Vermilion in charge of
a geological surveying party for a tour of
exploration in tbe Black Hills, is sending
back reports of great interest concerning
the discovery of an old volcano on Band
Creek, in the Bad Lands, not far from
Hermosa.
Near the point where Sand Creek empties
into the White River is a hill some eighty
feet in height- This hill, Professor Todd
says, vibraies and groans almost con
stantly. The squaw men living in the
vicinity are given as authority for the
statement that it has once or twice trem
bled so violently as to overturn heavy
wagons and has thrown down persons
standing upon it. About half wav up its
side is a bed of volcanic ashes, between
ten and fifteen feet in depth.
Another peculiar formation is a valley
near Pine Ridu'e, in which are numerous
shifting dunes, which are believed to
change their positions every change of the
wind" and are receiving much attention
from the surveying party. It is expected
the results of the expedition will be of
much value in science.
DIED IN A SWIMMING POOL.
W. B. Noble of Washington Expired Un
der Peculiar Circumstances.
GLENWOOD SPRINGS, Colo., July
27.â W. B. Noble of Washington died in
the swimming pool this evening. His
family are in Bar Harbor. Me., for the
summer and Mr. Noble had decided to-day
to join them. He had purchased a rail
road ticket and while waiting for the
train decided to go in the pool once more.
Being an invalid under the care of an at
tendant and physician Mr. Noble was not
easily satisfied and he sent the attendan
into the bathhouse on an errand while he
sat on the steps leading into the pool.
When the attendant returned Mr. Noble's
head was bent forward under the water
and he was taken out dead. Benator Mc-
Pherson of New Jersey, who is stopping at
Hotel Glenwood, took charge of the body
and will await advices from the family.
A DONNYBROOK OPENING.
Anarchists Are Denied Seats in
London's Socialist-Labor
Congress.
A Battle Results, the Hall Is Cleared
and the Meet ng Adjourns
for a Day.
LONDON, Eng., July 27.â The fourth
International Socialist Trade Council
opened ir this city to-day, 800 delegates
being p.f.sent. Among the American dele
gates are Lucian Sanial of the Socialist
Trade and Labor Alliance; Matthew Ma
guire, who represents the Socialist- Labor
party of New Jersey; H. Bestold, who rep
resents the brewery employes, and M.
Dalski.
It is expected that tbe congress will be
more important than those held in Paris
in 1889, in Brussels in 1891 and in Zurich
in 1893.
The chair was occupied by M. Cowey, a
Northumberland miner, who made a
speech welcoming the delegates. The re
port of the sectional meetirj s was read.
A large majority of the delegates voted
against: tbe admission of anarchists
when the question of whether they be
received as delegates was mooted in the
plenary congress.
A prolonged uproar followed, the an
archists and th*tir supporters being appar
ently determined that they should be re
ceived as delegates. Finally the anarch
ists tried to ftorm the platform. Their
opponents rallied in front of the platform
and hurled the anarchists back in a fistic
encounter.
The delegates of the British Inde
pendent Labor party sided with the
anarchists in their efforts to command
recognition.
James Keir Hardie, who formerly repre
sented the Labor party in the House of
Commons, was conspicuous for his bawl
ing and his personal threats against the
chairman. It having been found im
possible tn restore even a semblance of
order, the chairman declared the concress
adjourned until to-morrow, and ordered
tbe hall to be cleared.
FIG PLANTS FOR CALIFORNIA.
Experiments to Be Mnde With Smyrna
and Adriatic Varieties.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 27.âCap
tain Heiges, chief of the pomological divi
sion of the Agricultural Department, said
to a Call correipondent to-day that, if
possible, the department would distribute
some varieties of fig plants in California
this season.
"The Royal Horticultural Society of
London," said he, "obtained about 100
varieties of Smyrna and Adriatic tig
plants, and we secured sixty-nine varie
ties from the pocietv. They are growing
on the farm of John Rock at Niles, Cal.
"Dr. Gu.-tave Eisen of California, who is
an authority on horticulture, knows all
about figs and has listed the various kinds.
His list of names agrees with that of the
Royal Horticultural Society. Our prin
cipal object in growing the sixty-nine
varieties is to properly name and classify
the fruit. Some of each kind will be sent
to the department for that purpose. Ido
not know whether or not Mr. Rock will
have plants to distribute in California, but
I expect to hear from him soon in relation
to this matter."
Captain Heige says fig-growing prom
ises to be an important industry, not only
in California, but in Northern and Eastern
States. He nays they are being success
fully grown in Illinois, in Washington
State and as far north as Canada. Of
course the fruit grown in the North and
East is only for immediate consumption,
or for canning or pickling, as the figs can
not be sun dried and cured except in Cali
fornia.
The Department of Agriculture will
issue a bulletin on figs in about ten days.

BIG SHIPYARDS
BURN AT BELFAST,
Covered Eighty Acres and
Employed an Army
â¢ of Men.
LOSS OVER A MILLION.
Founded Thirty-Three Years Ago
and Owned by Harland
& Wolff.
BUILDERS GF THE OCEANIC
Figures Showing the Business Growth,
Enterprise and Originality of
the Firm.
BELFAST, Ireland, July 27.â The great
shipbuilding yards of Harland & Wolff, in
this city, were burned to-day. The loss
is $1,250,000. They covered eighty acres.
The firm employed upward of 8000 bands.
In 1853 the foundation of what has been
known for years a: Harland & Wolff's
shipyard was laid on Queens Island, and
the Mary Sewhouse, a sailing ship of 1289
tons register, was launched in tbe follow
ing year. It was owned by R. Hickson &
Co., and Edward Harland was general
manager. At that time it covered four
acres of ground and turned out 6707 tons
of shipping in the period from 1853 to
1858. In the latter year it was sold to Mr.
Harland. At the time of the fire it cov
ered over seventy acres and employed at
times 10,000 men and never less than 7000,
and in October last had ships of 33,000
aggregate tonnage under hand.
ThegroTtb. of the business is shown as
follows: From an aggregate tonnage of
6707 in the five years ending in 1358 the
aggregate rose to 30 vessels of HO.L'ZB tons
in tbe period ending in 1864; then 36 ves
sels of 28,023 tons; then 17 vessels of 46,282
tonB; in the period ending in 1879 44 ves
sels of 57,068 tons; in the five years ending
1884 104,025 tons; in the period ending
in 1889 156,077 tons, and during the four
years ending December, 1893, 247,777 tons.
After standing alone two years Mr. Har
land took G. W. Wolff as his partner, and
they Degan by building three iron steam
ers for Bibby, Son* <fe Co., of Liverpool.
Mr. Harland's originality and independ
ence of thought at once asserted itself, and
he departed from professional orthodoxy.
He did not build fat, tubby ships, but
long, lean ones; he increased tbe length
without increasing the breadth of beam;
he got great strength by the extension of
the ironwork, so that the hull became
really a "box girder"; he made the masts
all of one length, abolished yards, reduced
the number of sails, and in divers other
ways made changes in the form of steam
ers which time showed to be improve
ments, but which were viewed with sus
picion, and often with derision. The
earliest steamer of the long, lean type
which entered the Mersey from Belfast
was scoffed at and foreoi'dained to Davy
Jones, and tbe immense Campania, built
by this firm, is even now viewed with sus
picion by seamen.
Every boat now in the White Star fleet
has been built by Harland 4 Wolff. The
Oceanic, which for years ran between San
Francisco and the Orient under the tiag of
the Occidental and Oriental Company,
first of tbe series built to equal and excel
the Cunarders, had 400 feet keel, 32 feet
hold and oniy 41 feet beam ; and she inau
gurated a new type of ocean steamer, both
in the principles of construction and in
tbe improvements of the internal fittings.
In this, for instance, cabin passengers
were first carried amidships; hitherto they
bad been at the stern, where the heaving
and the vibration are the greatest. The
success of this vessel led to the building
of the line entirely at Belfast
ON EASTERN DIAMONDS.

JUMPED INTO THE RIVER.
With Her Two Children a Woman
Attempts to Die in the
Delaware.
The Little Ones Perish, but the Mother
Is Hauiei Out and May
Recover.
CAMDEN, N. J., July 27.-After taking
carbolic acid to-day, Mrs. Mary Herman,
wife of John Herman, jumped into the
Delaware River with her two children in
her arms. The children were drowned,
but the woman was rescued in an uncon
scious condition, and is now at a hospital
in a precarious condition.
The supposed motive for the act is that
the woman had been charged by her
husband with misconduct with another
man. The woman made her preparations
deliberately. The children, boys aged 3
years and 13 months respectively, she
took to Walnut-street wharf.
She tied the feet and hands of the elder
boy and the leet of the younger one to
gether, then drinking half of a bottle of
carbolic acid she took the children in her
arms and jumped into the river.
Some men who were fishing near by in a
boat saw the woman jump, and rowed to
the spot and pulled her ont as she was
sinking for the third time. The children
never rose to the surface.
When Herman was told of the tragic
occurrence, he attempted to commit sui
cide, but was restrained, and to-night is
being held at the City Hall to prevent
him from killing himself.
A SPLENDID ARMY RECORD.
General Batchelder Retires Full of Years
and Honors â Speculation as to
His Successor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, July 27.-Hav
ing reached the age limit to-day, General
Richard N. Batchelder, qua.termaster
general of the army, has been placed on
the retired list. His army record is an
enviable one. Few men can count more
honors than have been showered upon
him for bravery in the field and diligent
duty to his post in after-war days.
Wtio will succeed the retiring quarter
master is not known. Among the men
most prominently named for the position
are Colonel G. H. Weeks of Washington ;
Colonel James M. Moore, stationed at New
York; Colonel Charles G. Sawtelle, sta
tioned at Governors Island, and Colonel
Marshall T. Ludington, stationed at Chi
cago.
General Batchelder, a native of New
Hampshire, entered the military service
in the quartermaster's department of a
New Hampshire reeiment soon after the
war broke out and served during the entire
war, comin-,' out at the end as a brevet
brisradier-eeneral. When the war ended
he remained in the regular army with the
rank of captain. He steadily advanced
until on the 26th of June, 1890", he became
brigadier-general and quartermaster-gen
eral.

NEBRASKA CITY, Nebr., July 27.â At
an early hour Sunday morning John
Ricker, a packing-house employe, was
shot and killed at a bouse oi ill repute by
Mrs. Anna Sopher. Ricker, with some
companions, had been drinking, and they
called at the house and were refused ad
mittance. It is claimed that Mrs. Sopher,
from an upper window, fired the shot
which killed the youth. She and a man
named Spencer were arrested pending an
inve tipation.
This evening news reached the city that
a mob of packing-house men was forming
with tbe avowed purpose of lynching the
woman and man. The Sheriff placed a
strong guard about the jail and did all in
his power to protect the prisoners.
At midnight it is reported that the plans
for the attact upon the jail are complete,
and that the mob is on the river bottoms
preparing for its work. The intention, as
near as can be learned, is to move on the
jail about 3 a. m., and, as the city and
county officers have had warning, stub
born resistance is promised, and several
prominent citizens are out seeking the
angry men to try and dissuade them from
their purpose. The efforts of the peace
makers to find the mob have been so far
unsuccessful, as the leaders are trying to
avoid observation.

Two Young Rivals in Love
Engage in a Vicious
Combat.
EACH BADLY DAMAGED.
Meet Before a Select Crowd to
Arbitrate With Their
Fists.
KNOCK-DOWNS ARE FREQUENT.
Spectators Separate the Pair When
One's Wrist Is Broken by
a Blow.
STOCKTON, Cal. ? July 27.-One of the
most vicious fist fights that has ever
taken place in this city came off in the
rear of Higginboitham's stables on Market
street yesterday afternoon. The partici
pants were two young men who are in
love with the same fair maiden, and who
met yesterday on California street and
differed as to which was entitled to the
major share of her affections. One of
them, a 20-year-old son of Brown, th?
Sutter-street junk-dealer, offered to settle
the difÃculty with his rival, a yorng man
named Gleason, who is employed in tbe
Houser-Haines works ; j this city, by re
sorting to their fists .'he challenge was
promptly accepted and the rivals repaired
to the rear of tbe stable, where several
men gathered about to see that each had
fair treatment at the hands of the other.
The tight, which was not by rounds, was
fiercely contested from start to finish. It
was only when neither man was able to
â¢trike another blow that the mill ended,
with honors even.
When the men had stripped for the fray
Brown appeared to be much the lighter,
weighing only 125 pounds, while his op
ponent weighed over 140 and was stockily
built and able to take punishment. At
the call of time they went at it hammer
and tongs and did not stop except when
one was knocked down, and then they were
back at each other in an instant. Neither
had any skill in handling his fists and as
a result it beoame a bruising contest.
Both were determined, but Brown seemed
to have the most pluck and energy.
Gleason scored the first knockdown and
sent his smaller antagonist sprawling with
a well-directed blow. Brown was on his
feet like a Hash and gave Gleason as good
as he sent.
After fighting for half an hour Brown
broke hU wrist. He wanted to continue
the fight, but Gleason was staggering
about from the effects of the blows
received and the spectators stopped the
miil.
FARMERS LOSE HEAVILY.
Ihe JifMtroyrd Woodbridge Dam Cannot
Re Repaired.
STOCKTON. Cal., July 27.â 1t is doubt
ful if the Woodbridge dam in the Moke
lumne River, a portion cf which was
swept away yesterday, can ever be re
paired so that it will last. It appears
that there was no proper foundation for
the piles that were driven by Contractor
Tnmelty last year, and while they were
sunk to a depth of twenty-four feet the
water eventually undermined and washed
them from their positions.
Receiver Chapman of the Canal Com
pany arrived in Woodbridge this after
noon. In his opinion the present dam can
never be repaired so that it will be of any
account. He believes a brnsh overflow
dam can be built for about $4000, and will
answer every purpose and keep the water
in the canals. Pie will have a conferenoe
to-morrow with the farmers and Â«cc
whether they will be willing to advance
any more money to repair the dam.
_Last year, when the break occurred,
those ranch-owners who had acreage
under irrigation put up the funds to make
the repair?, which cost $5000 There is
little chance of tbeir repeating this acMon
Many will be almost bankrupt. The canal
company is.Â«ued scrip in payment for
rights of way, and this was to he used
bythefarmerÃ in buying water rights of
the company. The con.pany also issued
timc-checka for labor, and gave scrip for
materials used. A. 11. Cowell of Lodi
holds to-day some $20,000 worth of time
checks belonging to himself and others. He
said that many of those who counted on
gettinir money on their time-checks were
in destitute circumstances, ana had it not
been for thn fact that he was carrying
them until the suit now before the United
States Circuit Court is settled they would
be starving. He holds |6000 worth of the
romnanv's time-check?, and the rest of
the $20,000 is made up of those plaoed in
his hands by laborers and tradesmen.
Receiver Chapman will probably report
soon to Judt-e McKenna the condition of
affairs, and the court may order tie com
pany n business wound up.

Agreement lieachrd by Stockton's Tteo
Xeu) Jlailtcayt. " *"
STOCKTON, Cal., July 27.-Chief En
gineer Storey of the,. Valley road was in
town to-day to examine, in conjunction
with Chief Engineer Atherton of the Coal

SANTA ROSA, Cal., July 27.â An at
tempt to remove the honey from a bee
hive at the residence of Louis Locke yes
terday resdlted in three persons being
nearly stung to death by the angry honey

LOS ANGELES WARFARE,
Wong Chee Seriously Wounded
by a Member of a Rival
Tong.
Hop Sing Hatchet Men Sek Revenge
for a Murder of E ghteen
Months Ago.
Los Angeles Office of The Call )
328^oith Broadway. >
Los Angeles, Cal., July 27.)
Wong Lhee, the leader of the Bing Gong
Toug faction in this city.was shot through
the jaw to-night by Wing Chew Gow, a
highbinder. He is seriously wounded.
The shooting was the outcome of a fac
tional fight which has raged here for years
past, but tbe immediate cause which led
to tbe attempt on Chee's life was a boy
cott levied by Chee's company against the
See Yips, a tributary of the Hop Sing
Tong, of which Wing Gow is a member.
There is no doubt in tbe minds of the po
lire that Wing and a companion, Gon On
Chong, were hired to kill Chee, as numer
ous attempts have been made on the life
of the Bing leader.
Chee was walking along Alameda street
near Fereuson alley at 9 o'clock when
Wing Gow and Gong Chong stepped up in
the darkness from either side and closed
in on him. Both had revolvers in their
hands, and without further ado Wing
Gow pointed his weapon at Chee's head
and fired.
Cbee fell to the sidewalk without a
word, and the two highbinders ran north
on Alameda street to Marchessault, where
they separated. Officer Matusziewig
caught Wing, however, and handcuffed
him, while Officer Stephenson arrested
Chong in the east part of Chinatown.
Cbee was hurried to the receiving hos
pital, where Police Surgeon Bryant
dressed his wound. The ball entered on
the right side, passed through the tongue,
almost severing it, and went out on the
leftside, breaking the jaw in three places.
Chee's face was burned by the powuer.
The wound was very painful and Chee
could not talk, but his assailants were
brought before him and he identified
Wing as the one who had fired the shot
and Chong as the companion of the high
binder.
About a year and a half ago Louie Suey,
a member of the opposing company, was
assassinated, and Won? Chee was ar
rested with Wonc Chuey and Wong
Wing, charged with the crime.
Chuey was sentenced to life im
prisonment, wbile the other two
were acquitted. The feeling between the
faciionÃ has been intense since then, and
recently Chee's company began a boycott
against the See Yips, a tributary to the
Hop See Tong, and this served to itensify
the animosity^

throughout the day by a large number of
teachers, who gathered in tbe building to
hear the first reports of any changes which
should be made. It was rumored early in
the day that Principal Childs was likely to
be dropped aud a change in several of the
department teachers was probable, and
this report proved true.
Tbe board spent the larger portion of
the morning and afternoon in executive

The board a few minutes later went into
executive session, which continued until
3:30 o'clock, a recess being taken only
long enough for a lunch, which was served
in the library by the janitor of the school.
When the board met again in open ses
sion, Trustee Wilhoit moved that it pro
ceed to tbe election of a principal. No
nominations were made, and tbe Gov
ernor requested the trustees to prepare
their ballots. When the ballots were
counted, the first name read was A. H.
Randall, and those in the room seemeU to
comprehend that a change was to be made
i and that Professor Childs was to be
dropped. Dr. Thomas P. Bailey got two
I votes, but three were for A. H*. Randall.
Governor Budd stated that te declined to
vote.
On motion of Trustee Angel, the election
of Professor Randall was made unanimous.
Dr. Bailey, it was stated, was not a candi
date for the office, and the votes given him
was purely complimentary.
Trustee Blacu moved that tbe salary of
the principal be fixed at $3400 a year, the
same as that received by the principals of
I the other normal schools of the State, mi
i stend of 13600, as formerly paid the princi
pal of the San Jose school.

ton was re-elected vice-president and Miss
Elizabeth B:aisdale secretary of the board.

C. H. A-shworth was re-elected janitor
at a salary of $1800, to provide his own
assistants.
Stephen A. Jones of the faculty resigned,
Wavne P. Smith was dropped and M. E.
Dailey was given leave of absence for a
year.
Professor A. H. Randall, the newly
elected principal, was born in Livermore,
Me., passing bis boyhood there and taking
tne ordinary course in the puolic schools
of the Pine Tree State. In the high school
he fitted himself for college, entering tbe
Maine Wesleyan University, from which
he finished bis education, taking a literary
i and scientific course. He taught four
years in bis native State, tbe last year in
"the Leeds High School.
Desiring a wider field of action, in 1864
he came to California, and becan, as most
teachers had to at that early day, in one of
the grammar if 'tools. After two years of
this work he was called to tbe Stockton
High School, and held the position of
principal of that school for sixteen years.
During those years his influence was
widely felt, as he aided in forming the
character of many who have honorably
filled bisfh positions, our present Governor,
James H. Budd. amoni; the number.
From Stockton he went to Santa Cruz,
where he was elected principal and city
superintendent of schools, He held these
positions but one term, as the trustees of
the State Normal School in San Jose,
moved by his marked succesa at Stockton
and his wise and conservative work on
the State Board ot Education, of which
he was a member for several years, called
him to this school and gave him the posi
tion of teacher of physics and mathe
matics.
In January, 1884. he began his work in
the Normal School which has won for him
the position to which he is now elected.
Professor Randall brings to the discharge
of the new duties that will devolve upon
him wide experience, ripe scholarship
and a strong determination to make the
Normal School at San Jose not only the
best in the Btate but among the best in
the country.
Trustee Dinkelspiel, when asked why
Principal Childs was dropped, stated that
it was in respect to the desire of one
whose wishes are generally obeyed. Re
said he could not call any names, but thÂ«
fight was an old one and the person mak
ing it a man of persistency in accomplish
ing his ends.
From this remark it was inferred that
the change in the principalship was made
at the request of tne Governor. It was
currently remarked among those familiar
witii i the affairs of the Normal School that
the defeat of Professor Childs for tbe prin-
C J. pa - l lp of the school was entirely due to
the influence exerted upon the trustees by
the Governor.
It was stated that the antagonism of the
Governor to Professor Childs has been bit
ter since the action of tne latter at the last
session of tbe Legislature in lobbying
against and securing tbe defeat of a pet
measure of the Governor's. This measure,
it was claimed, was to place all the Nor
mal schools, insane asylums and other
State institutions under one board of con
trol, to be appointed by the Governor.
This step was stated to be for the pur
pose of practically taking the schools and
asylums out of politics. It was boldly
asserted that the opposition of Professor
thilas to this measure angered the Gov
ernor and made him a ready listener to
the complaints of many teachers who at
tributed their defeat to the former princi
pal's influence.
The alleged statement by Professor
I bilds several montus ago that Governor
Budd had called the Normal School
grounds in this city a ranch, which state
ment was afterward denied by the Gov
ernor, was also said to have added fuel to !
the already burning fire of enmity.
Childs said he could give no reason for
his dismissal. He heard Budd was antag
onistic to him on account of the Sacra
mento wort which he did at the wish of
tbe trustees. He also heard O. A. Hale
had used his influence with tbe Governor
against him.
It was 1 o'clock this (Tuesday) morning
when the executive session was concluded.
W hen Professor Childs, who remained to
the end, saw that he had been given a
subordinate position at a salary of $1600
less than he had been getting, he said he
would accept.
TRAGEDY NEAR SAN JOSE
John Carrigan, a War Veteran,
Commits Suicide by
Hanging.
Feared He Would Be Discharged
From a M nial Position and
Left Penniless.
SAN JOSE. Cal., July 27.â John Carrl
gan, an old veteran, committed suicide by
hanging at the Saratoga saloon, on tbe
Meridian road, near the Sanitarium, this
morning. For the past five years Carri
ean has been earning his living by doing
odd jobs about the place for Mrs. Schmei
chel, the proprietress.
Carrigan had been drinking hqavily for
two or three days, and last evening Mrs.
Schmeichel informed him that if he did
not let liquor alone she would discharge
him. About noon to-day the 12-year-old
daughter of Mrs. Schmeichel discovered
his body hanging from a rafter of a shed
in the bacc yard. It is thought the fear
of being discharged and losing his only
means of support preyed upon his mind
and led him to take his life. Carriean
was (3! years of age and a native of New
York. He served in the Navy daring the
Civil War.
FIRE AT SAN JOSE.
Spontaneous Combustion Starts a Blase
in a Printing Office.
SAN JOSE, Cal., July 27.â A fire in the
printing office of Brown & Son, followed
by an explosion in the saloon of Leo Schu
nerber on the floor below, caused quite a
little excitement in this city shortly before
12 o'clock to-night. Brown's pressroom
has been in active operation for many
years, and as the place was well soaked
with the oil from the presses it is believed
that the hre was caused by spontaneous
combustion. The explosion resulted from
the. formation of gas between the floor of
the pressroom and the ceiling of the
saioon.
The damage to the building, which is
owned by Joseph Colombet, will not ex
ceed $400, as the fire was promptly extin
guished. Brown's loss consists of damage
to tbe presses. Schunerber's loss is nom
inal.

SETTLER WRIGHT'S VICTORY.
A Co-Defendant With the Company
Is a Gainer by the
Ruling.
Los Angeles Office of The Call,)
328 South Broadway, V
Los Angeles, Cal., July 27. J
Judge Ross, in the United States Circuit
Court here this morning, filed an opinion
in the case of the United States vs. the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company et al.
The suit was instituted by the Govern
ment to have annulled a patent to lands
heretofore granted to the Railroad com
pany. Among the defendants was C. M.
Wright, who alleges title in himself to a
portion of the land not only by virtue of a
deed from the railroad company but
through conveyance from the State of
I California, to which, he alleges, a portion
of the said land was granted and listed by
the United States as a part of the school
I land grant.
The court holds that whether the State's
claim was valid or not, the fact that it
existed at the time of the definite location
of the railroad excluded the lands in con
j troversy from the category of public lands,
to which alone tho company's grant at
i tached, which view is conclusive as against
j the contention of the defendant railroad
l company. Tbe court holds that Wright
| was a purchaser hi good faith, and that
the right and title to the land purchased
! by him was confirmed in him by the act
approved March 2, 1896, and the patent
! therefore cannot be annulled.
Tbe decree annuls the patent to the rail
| road company to the south half of section
11, township 3 south, range 9 west, and
establishes its validity a3 far as Defendant
Wright is concerned. The decree is with
out prejudice to the right of the United
States to sue for the value of the land thus
confirmed to Wright.

Exchanges Ideas With
Business Men,
LESSONS OF THE PAST.
Many Suggestions Gleaned From
San Francisco's Former
Experiences.
"UNSYMPATHETIC AMBHDMEIIT.
Socialists Object to tie Ideas Expressed
and Hold a Meeting of Their
Own.
Seldom, has a larger audience filled the j
Metropolitan Temple than that which ;
assembled last night at the great social re- â¢
form mass-meeting under the auspices of
the Salvation Army. Tne was <
in the best sense a representative â  one, the j
undesirable element being literally j
crowded oat ny the members of society's j
better ranks, who were wedsed into every |
nook and cranny of the auditorium.
The stage was tastefully draped with '
hangings of scarlet and orange, amid ;
which flashed forth in letters of gold the ;
motto, "God First." The National colors j
were everywhere. On the stage were '
â¢eats for Hugh Craig, the chairman, and ,
the following named vice-presidents:
Irving M. Scott. George Stone, W. E. '
Hale, F. W. Dohrmann. W. Doxey, Judge )
Campbell, A. A. Wai:--. W. S. Green. J.
B. Carman, Harry C Gesford, Taylor (
Rogers, G. E. Butler, E. J. Depne, L. R.
Ellert and W. M. Bunker. To the right ;
and left sat members of the army from all j
the posts in the City, and from Oakland,
Alameda. Berkeley. San Pablo, San Jose, j
Temescai, San ilateo and other near-by j
towns. Â£ach delegation Drought its \
band, and in the hall the body of trained
instrumentalists united in producing some
trary excellent music.
The meeting opened with an overture, at .
tne close of which a brief prayer was of- j
fered by the Rev. Mr. Peet of Palo Alto.
"Am I my brother's keeper?" asked Mr. 1
Craig in comraeacing the openinz address. !
"We see in the world many proofs of the !
fact that no section of humanity can be ;
neglected with impunity. The public suf
fers wnen any portion of it is left to itself.
It looks as though the unemployed, the
idle and the disabled should sot be allowed
to lie about cumbering the ground, bat
rather cared for and aided.
"A divine law obliges man to love his
neighbor as himself, and this law. it
seems, the Salvation Army is striving to \
obey.
"In this and other lands the Salvation '
Army it recognized as a grand force for ;
tbe amelioration of human society's evils.
As for us, residents of this City, we realize
that Commander Booth-Tucker's visit
here is- for us- a great portent of good; :
bence we extend him a warm and hearty '
welcome, and we promise him an abun- ;
dance of metallic ammunition for the
campaign. [Great cheering.}
"â Now I have spoken enough, but before
I dose let me warn all present that the
hat will be passed around in order that all
may see what San i'randsco can do for
the Salvation Army."
"Really, Mr. Chairman," commented
the commander, 'you would make a
splendid Salvationist," and amid much
cheering Mr. Craig took his seat.
George Â£. Butler next welcomed Com
mander Booth-Tucker and his audience to
the present gathering.
The commander here interpolated the
request that the people of San Francisco
would not look upon him as a stranger
from abroad, bat as a friend and a fellow
laborer in the field of Christ.
W. M. Bunker was next introduced.
'â¢We are met to-night in a noble cause.
he said. 'We are met to help those who
help themselves. I think we may depend
on our experience of the past, and depend
on the commercial men at any rate.
"At one time in UN it looked as though
we would have the most pressing want in
the City, but at this critical moment the
rich and the poor jointly applied the
remedy, for the poor gave as well as the
ricn, that the reputation of San Francisco j
should be maintained. -The result was I
$3XOGO was raised and the City was the
gainer of a broad road in Golden Gate
Pars. In 1593 a similar distress was
prevalent ac : a fund of 190.000 was raised,
every cent of wbich went to the man be
nind the shoveL
: "But that is not the kind of work for a
free people. We wish permanent work for
the laborer; not temporary relief. Let me j
pay a tribute to the 909 men who went out ,
to the park and did an honest day's work,
and said Thank you.' Said it, too. in a
tone that meant sincerity. It seems to
me that this is the time for ail the people
in and out of the army to co-operate, in
order that we may snow the cohesing
power of this community.
"It seems to me that this is a matter iii
which we should all join forces, but as an
aid to that vast number of men who are
anxious to act themselves."
Ensign Share, a Salvation lassie with a
clear sweet voice, sang "The Army Red
and Blue," the audience joining heartily
â¢ in the chorus.
"Industrial .Farms'' gave William S.
Green the theme for an eloquent and for
cible address.
"After observing human conditions for
some years," said Mr. Green, "1 have
come to tbe conclusion that the majority
of the" unemployed need very little in the
way of aid or charity. Bat that little is
most imperatively needed.. Man has a
ri*-ht to the living which he is willing to
work for. How great a blessing it would
be for enforced idlers could they out have
a place whither to betake tnemselvea m
the hour of distress.
."This, place would not be a workhouse
nor a poorfarm, but a place where any one
abie and willing might gain an honorable
and comfortable living. , The plan has
worked admirably in Detroit, and some
thing of the sort has been essayed in other
Eastern cities with signal success."
Commander Booth-Tucker was briefly
introduced, and the audience greeted him
with prolonged cheers. . .
* "I am sure I esteem it a very great priv
ilege to address. this vast' audience this
evening," he and, "and while , I indorse
almost everything that has been said 1
must demur to the impression which one
of our vice-presidents seems to have that
California is regarded as something of a
*woolly* place. "On the contrary, Califor
nia is looked upon by the entire world as
decidedly ide aw ate, and particularly is
it famed for its generosity. lam afraid
the reputation which you have thus gained
has served to attract to you undeserving
candidates for charity.
"i am proud to be the leader of one of
the grandest bodies of men and women the
world has ever seen. I feel that San Fran
ci-oo is going to occupy the proud position
of being the first city to leap up and say to
the Salvation Army, 'We will De the nrst
to aid you in â  manufacturing redemption.'
While I travel from platform to platform
It; tell the peonle of the ' kind ex
pressions of the speakers to-night, and the
work of redemption which is commenced
here will stretch not only across California
but ail the way from San Francisco to New
York.
"We - are looked upon sometimes as
though we are a little bit weak-headed,
bat it is a little wrong.
"Warden Hale will bear me out when I
say that Sunday week we had a most
beautiful meeting at San Qoentin jail. It ,
was one of the best audiences I ever
loosed upon. I thought of the thousands
these people represent â people of the â¢
lowest and most hopeless classes. In our
social work we have 300 institutions,
manned by over 1200 officers. We find ;
noble men and women in the army who !
ask for no wages, but say, 'We don't care i
for the dollars ; give us the same food and
the same shelter as the poor people we go
to help.' '
"We shelter night by night some 10.000 i
people. In England tec cost of our social j
works last year was $730,000, and out of
that the poor people contributed $650,000.
We mi-rht have done -even better than '<
that, but we bare made it a rule never to
undersell the regular market.. We have ;
supplied 1,300.000 meals during one year
and have furnished beds to 1.400. 000. We
have dealt with the worst classes, men
who seemed to have no hope except *ne
grave or the prison. Of these SO per cent
have been brought to lives of usefulness.
"The Salvation Army is nothing if it is
not practicable. Already the army here
has a shelter for men capable of accom
modating 300 and a women's shelter with
accommodations for fifty. We have a
home for poor friendless girls and we
have a children's home with accommoda
tions for poor friendless waifs. I feel that
there are some things more. We believe
in havine a City colony for the sake of
helping the poor in the City, but we do
not feel that it is possible to deal properly
with these City poor unless we have also a
farm colony.
"We want 1000 acres somewhere in reach
of San Francisco. We fee! that it is on
; the land and out of the land that the
i problem of our poverty is to be solved.
\ We have burnt our fingers several times
trying: to start a farm of that kind without
capital. I am afraid we cannot enter upon
I such an enterprise with less than 110,000
-There is another point which I consider
: of greater importance, and if this meeting
results in notning else I hope it will be
the initiation of a movement for a home
for released criminals. I would appeal to
you to-night that San Francisco shall have
a home where released prisoners can get a
fresh start in life.
"We are hoping soon to start a Salva
tion Army hospital where we can aid the
poor who are ill at a small co*t."
The commander concluded . with a
eulogy of San Francisco and a glorious
account of what he expected of this City
in the future.
As the commander finished speaking A.
J. Oliver presented a resolution, which
was promptly seconded, applauding the
projects of benevolence outlined in the
Salvationist officer's address.
"I offer an amendment to that resolu
tion," said Georee Speed, rising in the gal
lery, and in a clear, penetrating voice he
read the following amendment:
Whisejlj, It is evident to the thinking people I
c i tni- community that it is the desire tee Sal
vation Arm.- to usurp â  .-a functions of govern
ment; â i i wnereas, it is evidently a scheme I
foisted on the worthy cnemployed to give I
thesx a surfeit of labor without any compen
sation, save that of "food, shelter and rai- |
ment"(?l; and wbereas.it is reasonable and
probable that after a season's work tae unem- j
ployed wonld practically be in the same condi- I
, tion that they were when they commenced
said Labor; aad whereas, we are*:-: in Holy
Writ *-That the laborer is wr.rthy of his hire"
we have looked tor it in vain in this scaeae; I
therefore be it
â¢.-â fo 'â â â -.. Tfcat we,' tne unemployed citizens
of San Francisco and its immediate vicinity,
'â  do hereby protest asaisst any reUfious boiy |
in general, and the Salvation Army in particn
: lar, handling the affairs of the unemployed
' and assuming the functions of government to :
: the discomfort of the many; therefore, be it
; Knotted, That we, the af .resaid unemployed,
j do amend that it is the sense of this meetictr
I that the contemplated relief work be placed
' where It rightly belongs, in the hands cf tbe
â  Labor Commissioner of the State of Calif orsia.
For a moment silence reigned. bein?
straightway succeeded by a frightful up-,
| roar, mends and opponents of the first
[ motion trying to drown each other's j
' voices by snouting themselves hoarse.
â¢â¢Amendment!*' cried some. "Original ;
. motion I,* thundered others; and matters
! were reaching a rather tempestuous stag**, j
wnen Mr. Craig, his face very pale, liter- j
ally bellowed forth the words:
"The chair will decide that the amend- |
i ment is out of order. Those in favor of
i the original motion will please say 'aye.' "
A deafenine volume of ayes, noes, hisses
j and grcans surged through the building.
"Contrary, no!" The words resounded
I amid the clamor like an explosion of
j dynamite and were greeted by a chorus of
â¢ yells indescribable in its wild intensity.
"The chair decides that the ayes have
j it," vociferated Mr. Crate, and at a sign
; from the commander the music struck
jup "America" in tones so loud that
| further shouting was in vain.
As the audience was leaving the hall i
j some one snouted that there would be a I
! meeting of the friends of the amendment
upon the steps of the Mint building. Be
' fore the bail had been fairly cleared D. M.
â¢Willey. a prominent socialist, had tacen a
position on the steps, and was addressing
between 300 and 400 sympathizers. He |
denounced the Salvation Army as an
organized band of beggars, which was
seeking to usurp the functions of govern
ment.
No system, he argued, could be of bene-
I fit to the unemployed which contemplated
'. giving the laborer less than he produced.
The poor-farm proposition advanced by
Booth-Tucker, he maintained, was simply J
i a scheme for aggrandizing and enriching
j the Salvation Army. as the laborer could
j not possibly consume all he produced from
[ the soil, and tne army would get the sur
; plus. - .i:l.:'
George Speed, the author of the amend
| ment, made a brief but very spirited
speech in support of the propositions ad
| vanced in the document. He called upon
! the laborers to be alive to their interests
: at the tÂ»oi.s and not rely upon the charity
of such an organization as that repre
sented by Booth-Tucker.
Ross Martin, another prominent so
i cialist and labor leader, was called for and
made an impassioned speech. He de
nounced the Salvation Army as insincere
in its . religion and accused it of having i
i sinister motives in its efforts to aid the \
| unemployed. The only hope or the
I workingman. he declared, lay in the
â  Socialist Labor party, and he warned his
i hearers not to be led astray by the excite
| ment of the bass drum, the sentimentality j
awakened by parading . lassies or the
crocodile tears of hypocrisy.
He denounced in severe terms the atti
| tude of employers toward the laborer
â¢ and argued that it was wasted energy for |
men to strive for the betterment of the
idle who gave no thought in .their pros
perity to the hands that had produced
their affluence.
All of the speakers were frequently in
j terrupted with vigorous applause, and at
: the conclusion of the meeting the amend
; ment offered in the ball was offered to the
. assembly and passed unanimously. â 
Though much feeling was manifested
and free expression given to the views of
the speakers there was no approach to
i lawlessness or disorder, and the open-air
meeting broke up noiselessly and in peace.
Grand Jury Indictment.
D. Suffers, a longshoreman, was indicted by
the Grand Jury yesterday afternoon for inter
fering with an officer in . the . discharge of
duty. Tne story told by witnesses was to the

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JTXY 28, 1896.
JOHN P. IRISH
TRUMPETS A NOTE
The "Honor Bright" Democ
racy Will Be in the
Local Field.
GOLD MEN" ORGANIZING
Irish Proposes to Challenge Can
didate Bryan to a Cam
paign Debate.
PLAS3 OP GOLD DEMOCEATS-
They Will Sse That Jeffersonian Pria
ciples Perish Nat From the
Face of the Earth.
The old-line and sound-money Demo
crats are to effect a State organization in
California, according to John P. Irish,
who is perhaps the leading and most
active figure amid the Cleveland Democ
racy of the State.
Mr. Irish calls the conservative Democ
racy which is not ready to follow tbe lead
of Bryan on the high road to Populism
the "Honor Bright Democracy."
As the telegraphic columns of the daily
papers have informed the public, the
sound-money Democracy of tbe East, led
as far as initial action goes by the sound
money Democrats of Illinois, have deter
mined to put a separate ticket in the Geld.
and in August 7 a meeting will be held in
Indianapolis, at which a provisional Na
tional Committee will be organized snd a
Nations! convention b
California will be represented in that
provisional National Committee and in the
call which will follow its organization,
but by whom has not ye: been deter
mined. John P. Irish prophesies that
there wiii be a complete State organisation
of soand-money Democrats formed. If
that prophecy De fulfilled there ia yet an
other State convention to come. Indeed
Mr. Irish says that the "Honor Bright
Democracy will put local tickets in the
field in this State.
Mr. Irish returned yesterday morning
from a trip to his ranch in Placer County
and wen: back to the said ranch in the
c. Upoa being congratulated on
his opportunity to visit a ranch, he re
marked, with Chicago in hii mind, â¢
I've jast been among wi.d cattle.'
Mr. Irish, i: will be remembered,
stopped at Omaha on his way to the Chi
cago convention, and while there debated
the silver question with W. J. Bryan a
few days before Mr. Bryan went on to the
Windy City, said something about a cross
: and got nominated.
Mr. Irish will not discuss his discussion
wi:b Mr. Bryan, but he did say yesterday :
"It is my intention to challenge Mr.
Bryan to a continuation of that discussion
during tnis campaign in Nebraska, lowa
and Illinois."
Thus another interesting feature of this
interesting campaign comes into view.
Re.arding the political future Mr. Irish
talked yesterday ss follows:
"The 'Honor Bright' Democracy, with
out any concert of action, is organizing
in this Sta:e many clubs to advocate the
principles of Jefferson and to defend the
National honor and public credit.
"These clubs will soon be in contact and
in communication with each other and
ready to co-operate in supporting the
sourd-money candidate of the old De
mocracy who will be put in the field on a
Democratic p.atform early in September.
Several oi these clubs have already com
municated with me and I will be glad if
all will do so.
"This movement is coming from tbe
people in the Southern States, especially.
They are very eager and earnest in it.
The industrial South cannot survive the
destruction of its credit.
"The Democratic vote of California in
1594 wss about 84,000. From present indi
cations half of this vote will be cast for
the sound money candidate. This involves
a complete National organization and com
plete organizations in every State in the
Uaioo.
"Tbe call for the National convention
will be based on the Cleveland vote of
md every State in the Union will
have delegates at that convention. In
every State in the Union State and local
ticxet* loyal to this organization of Honor
Bright Democracy will be run.
"It is the determination of tbe men who
are in this movement tnat Jeffersonian
principles shall not perish from the face
of the earth lest free government perish
with them."
It will probably be some little time be
fore the "Honor Bright" Cleveland Demo
cracy of California comes forth panoplied
for the campaign, but the ear on the
ground may detect its coming and thereby
may be prophesied its mixture with the
music and tne thunder of tne California
conflict.
LOUD ON CAMPAIGN ISSUES
Enthusiastic Initial Meeting of the
Thirty-Seventh District
Republicans.
The first meeting of the Thirty-seventh
Assembly District Club was held last night
in Hilderbract Hall, in the basement of
430 Hayes street. There was a good at- ;
tendance and much enthusiasm. The offi
cers of the dab are: Morns Levy, presi
dent; E. J. Kolden, president; E. J.
Clark, secretary; Â£. M. Bash, treasurer,
and Robert Giles, sergeant- a
The constitution adopted provides that
the club shall be independent of any dab j
in the district; that it shall advance the
interests of . Republicanism, and that no
religious matters shall be allowed to be
brought up in the meetings. The follow
ing were named as on the executive > com
mittee : .
'W. J. â  Blattner. F. Eeters. J. Stevens, R.
RothoU, William Gallagher, John Crowley, H.
Borrea, John Brennan, C. Faneher.
- Eugene F. Loud, Representative , from
the Fifth Congressional District,' was mi
i troduced, and said, in part : "We are
placed on the eve of the campaign and
mast face . the issue?. The Democratic
party, with the Populists, expect to at
tack as by overturning the financial con
ditions which have existed for so many
years. The people can stand anything in
the cure of tariff, but when they attempt
to jure over the nnance^ihey will give the
finishing stroke to oar country.
. "The Government has ran â  1160,000,000
behind since Grover Cleveland was elected,
yet there is not a Democrat who â¢rill raise
his : hand", to . stay 'this destruction. . The
people will, on sober second thougnt,
thiak that tide country has had enough of
Democratic rale." and then Mr. Load pre
dicted that next November the people
will place in the Presidents! chair not a
man who is the man of politicians, bat
one who i* the choice of - the entire coun
try â William ilcKinley.
Colonel T. Y. Eddy, the nÂ«it speaker,
said that there has not been a campaign
so important as the present one since Use
one immediately preceding the Civil
War. He said that on the 3d of Novem
ber the peopla most declare if this conn-.
try shall maintain the present position at
the head or taxe its place at the tail of the
long string or the nations. The recent al
liance at St. Louis he denounced as an
unholy alliance that is a menace to the
country.
He urged upon those present to stand by
what example bad shown is the best poi
icy, ana not try experiments that are
fraught wi:h danzer.
Vice- President E. J. Hotden followed
with a few remarks on the silver question.
. -J. E. Field said that silver was not the
cause of the depression; it was the Demo
cratic measures which had created dis
trust.
J. Qoddard in a short address showed
how the Democratic administration aid
free trade cad destroyed the woolen in
dustry in this State and C:ty and urged
the adoption of the protective measures of
the Republican party.
E. B. Williams pave his views on the
silver question and drew attention to the
great evil that is threatening the Ameri
can people â the Japanese, who will flood
Use country with cheap Roods unless there
is a highprotective tariff.
John H. Roberts, the last speaker, con
gratulated the meeting upon the informa
tion it bad received from the speakers who
had preceded him, and closed by advising
all present to support ilcKiniey and Re
publicanism.
Just before the close of the meeting Thi
Call was tendered a vote of thanks for
the interest it has manifested in the dub.
TERROR IN CHINATOWN,
Hachet-Men Find That Their
Murderous Schemes Are
Not Appreciated.
Chinese Fighting-Men Will Bs Forced
to Lead Better Lives or
Suffer.
Sergeant "William Price, the mere men
tion of whose name chills the blood in the
highbinders' reins, who chases burglars in
deshabille for blocks OTer cobbles and
splintered-board sidewalks, who does not
fear the. wrath of the Chinese gods of tin
foil, has again instigated a reign of terror
in the Mongolian quarter.
The Chinese hatchet-men hare been
baring things their own way during the
past few months. Nothing the sir com
panies co -Id suggest" seemed to affect them
in the least.
A strong force of uniformed police was
laughed at by these law. ess Mongolians,
consequently something had to be done or
the members of the various tongs would
begin to slaughter one another as in olden
times.
Sergeant Price, whose heroic measures
quelled the last riot, which took place sev
eral years ago. was detailed day before
yesterday to maze a campaign against the
highbinder tones.
After consulting with the Chinese Con
sul, Fung Tung Heng. he decided to make
Hie miserable â  for the members of the Bo
On Ton?, who plan murders and black
mailing schemes in richly furnished apart
ments at 1014 Stoat ton street ; the Bo Leong

whose headquarters are located at 36
"WaTerly street.
Yesterday morning the crusade com
menced and ere nightfall many a Chinese
whose head had been bumped, or who had
enjoyed the pleasure of being becteddown
a night of stairs, was sorry that he bad
ever belonged to a highbinder association.
A vast number were willing and ready to
lay aside the ax and gun and offer the
olive ranch of peace.
Many were angered at the actions ot the
sergeant and his force, consequently the
fight bad to be . kept up until their spirit
was broken and they gave up.
During ice afternoon the entire list of
ton its was visited. In a number of places
the josses were knocked from their thrones
and the burning punks and sandalwood
were extinguished with douches of tea.
- Tables were slivered and topped down
Sign:* of stairs, and occasionally a fright
ened highbinder would take the same
route ana do fully as many turns before
be struck the landing at the bottom.
Crowds of gaobering Celestials, their
queues flying in the wind, would skurry
orer the roofs of buildings to escape the
cuffing* of police and prevent identifica
tion as being connected with one of the
tongs.
Last evening scenes were enacted which
threw Chinatown in a fev*r of excitement.
The members of the various tones were
almost certain that they ' would not be mo
lested by the police twice in the suse day.
They bad been cautioned during the after
noon not to return to their headquarters
again, but they heeded not. *
After dark they began to congregate in
their rooms. Without warning the police
would suddenly appear in the midst of one
of the gatherings and bedlam would break
oose. The Chinese would rush for me
stairways and well-directed knocks and
cuffs would assist them in their escape. -
A Chinese shoe has no heels, and as the
binder would strike the stairs, unless he
was overlapped before he reached them,
le would fairly skate down the flight with
i noise lite a Â»mall boy drawing a stick
iloug a picket fence. When be would
strike the bottom, however, his shoes
would stick to the pavement, over he
would go and both shoes would fly high, in
he air.
Without waiting for shoes he would gej
ip and hurry off to join bis comrades.
The energetic methods of Sergeant
Price and his squad thoroughly disquiet
he hatchet-men, but nevertheless he will
ceer them up until all â¢â  are anxious for

NEW PLAYS AND
NEW PLAYERS.
Attractions to Be Seen at
the Theaters This
Week.
"BOHEMIA" A SUCCESS.
A Play Resembling in Some
Manner the Old Favorite
" Trilby."
TRAWLETS BIDDER,"
" Carmen â  at the Tivoli Well Re-
ceivedâ "The Merchant of
Venice."
The Charles Frohman Empire Theater
Company opened at the Baldwin last even
ing in "Bohemia." a comedy adapted from
the French of Henri Merger, by Clyae
Fitch.
"Bohemia" is a distant relative of
"Trilby" and bears a strong family re
semblance to that play, bat lacks its
striking personality. "Trilby," minus its
tone-deaf heroine and her hypnotic mas
ter, Srenscali, would be an own cousia to
'â¢Bohemia.' 1
. A large -nd fashionable audience greeted
the Frohmans and gave them a most cor
dial reception.
The story of "Bohemia" is that of an
impressionable young Parisian, an embryo
poet, who would indulge in the unre
straint of the life of the Latin Quartier.
Rather than obey the wishes of his wealthy
ancle, who desires him to marry a rich
widow of hi* choosing, the poet abandons
nis fashionable friends and seeks to earn
hid living with his pen. Â« He meets, makes
friends with Mercel, a painter. Schanmard,
a musician, Coiline, a philosopher, and
their female companions, and falls in lore
with Mimi, a flower-girl. .
- The wicced uncle seeks to separata Ru
dolph, the poet, from his Mimi, and suc
ceeds for a short time, but they are re
united through the efforts of a faithful
servant who for a - time sided with the
uncle. ...
William Favorsham, as Rudolph, suc
ceeded admirably in depicting the woes
and lores of the impecunious poet, and at
once .became a favorite with the audience,
a position he was forced to share with
Robert Ederson, whose portrayal of the
character of Marcel, the spendthrift artist,
was cost admirable. J. Â£. Dodson as
Shanmard and Ferdinand Gotuchalk as
Coiline played well their parts. -
0! the ladies Miss Viola Alien, as Mimi,
was all that could be desired in her heav
ier, lines, but in . the lighter parts left
much to be desired. Miss Ida Conquest,
as the ' flighty Musette, was excellent, al
though the. Frenchiness of her actions, is
hardly compatible with American ideas of
even an unfaithful wife. . Miss Annie
Irish acted throughout in a dignified and
praiseworthy manner, although she im
personated the designing widow who
would wed the luckless poet.
Miss May Robson, as Mme. Benoit, the
lodging-house keeper, and Jamison L. Fin
ney as the dudish ; Comte de Beancbas?,
presented very pleasing character bits. Â£.
V. iiacius. tee wicked uncle, and W. H.
Crompton. the servant, were below the ex
cellent average of the company.
All in all, "Bohemia" is well worth see
ing, although last night it dragged a little.
It boasts a pretty little melody, which
runs throughout its action, and a number
of pretty phrases, the most catchy of
which occurs in the prologue, when Mar
cel says:
"Water in wine is like platonic affection
poured into love." "
The Colombia.
In spite of all counter attractions there was
the usual large and fashionable audience at .
the Columbia Theater List ni*a;. It caa be i
safely said that of all the productions siren by
the Frawley Company this season | the moat I
thoroughly successful is that of -The Highest I
Bidder," charmingly presented last evening.
At the fall of the curtain on the first ac: there
were several recalls for the company and it
was evident that Hr. Worthing had made an i
em panic hit in the role of Jack Hammerton, I
made famous by the younger Sotoem.
-The Highest Bidder' is by John Madison !
Morton, the celebrated English farce writer, â 
and was intended for the elder Sothern. It I
was first produced inXew York, at the Lyceum !
Theater, fire years * ago, and cad a whole i
year's run. While it is a difficult thing to in- <
vest so commonplace a character as an
auctioneer with the halo of romance, Mr.
Worthing succeeds by the sheer force of his
individuality and conscientious work in is- ;
terestlnz his audience in the character and in .
carrying its sympathy with him in the many l
misundertcandings into which his well-meant
kindness plunges him.
The third act was delightfully acted, and ;
the little love scene between him and Rose. !
Blanche Bates, was most natural, simple and
exceedingly interesting. As Rose, Blanche
Bates was especially neat and clever, and was
graceful in every scene. Madge Carr Cook as
Mrs. Honiton Lacy is a polished actress. She
played her part witn a feminine naturalness
that was caarining and was frequently en
cored. Petite Hope Boss always acts well and
was particularly clever as Louisa.
Harry Corson Clarke as the bluff old squire I
was most excellent, carrying the spirit of the '
part in an artistic manner.
Mr. Arbuckle made a very amusing charac- :
i ter of Sir McfÃn . Struggles. Tyrone Power was
' a dignified Lawrence Thornhill and Wilson
â  Eaoa as Sir Evelyn Graine rave one of the best
renditions of the play. The rest of the cast
were all equal to the requirements.
The Orpbeum.
Lydia Teamans-Titus _ made her reappear
ance last night at the Orpheum. She was re
ceived with the same appreciation that made
her departure from this theater a year ago so
much regretted by the public
The novelty on the ; bill was Herr Techow*s
troupe of performing cats, and they are likely
to prove a greater attraction than was Uacarts'
doc and monkey circus.
Virginia Aragon proved herself one .of the
most graceful and daring of high-wire per
formers. Biondi supplemented his clever
work in the House Drama by impersonating
in turn several famous orchestra leaders. The
rest of the bill includes Boss Snow, the VadU
sisters, Le-s Donates, the Masons, Washbome
slaters and others. . . . ;
-. At the Tivoll.
A delightful rendition 01 "Carmen" was
given at this theater last evening before a
large and appreciative audience.
Mmc- N"a:ali achieved a success as the gypsy
girl. Carmen, and sang and acted the part with
deiighiol eric and abandon. She divested the i
role of that coarseness ~~ and' exaggeration i
which so many who attempt it consider r a
necessary essential.
Anna ichnabel made a pretty and sympa
thetic Michaeia, and Irene Mull and Bernice
Holmes, ; who appeared respectively as Fras
quita and Mercedes, were all .their roles called
Signor Michelena as Don Jose was in splen
did - voice, and Signor Maurice de Vries'
rendition of the famous toreador song was the
feature of the evening.
Grand Opera- House.
"Mr. Barnes of Xew York" was well played
at the Grand Opera-house last evening, to a
large audience, with Jaaies W. Brophy in the
title role. This young actcr, since making his
debut here several years age -as filled many
star engagements ia the East, aad Judging
: from his Performance last evening, has put ia
his time to good advantage. The play was ele
gantly staged with' new and pretty scenery.
There were five curtain calls and many huge
bouquets ptssed over the footlights. The play
I will be given the re- 1 of the weak.
" Merchant of Venice." â 
j At the California Frederick Wards and Rose
i Coghlan played the principal , roles in the
: "If .ant of Venice" to a well-filled house.
' In Shakespearean work Waiie is a peer, and
I his portrayal of the star characters of the great
dramatist has won him fame the whole world
over.
His Shylock is a masterful interpretation of
the miserly money-lender mourning for sis
lost ducats and exalting over his comic
vengeance by terns.- His momentary triumph
is magnificent, and his final despair pitituL
Bo t Warde's support was nut wretched. The
lines were poorly memorized and indifferently
rendered.
! The Duke could not be heard and Rose
| Coghlan was a poor Portia. However good
! this favorite actress may be in other roles,
1 that of the dignified and graceful Venetian
i lady, who is lover and learned judge in cne, is
I beyond her. Her poise, manner and voice are
not Portia's, and tnat fact was painfully <ti>
| parent to the acdi'ence.
A pretty ballet and some rood music helped
ont the piece. To-night the Olympus and Pre
sidio parlors, X. =. G. W., will be tendered a
i benefit. - - â 
COMPLAINTS OF RAILROADS
Arguments for Lower Assessments Heard
by the State Board of
Equalization.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., July 27.â The
Board of Equalizationsconsumea the day
in listening to the wees of the lesser raii
road magnates of the State, and between
times made Chief Engineer Titcomb of the
Southern Pacific system deem. life a bur
den by questioning him on the amount of
track mileage in Aiameda County. By
j aid of official maps, he apparently sue- â¢
ceeded in convincing the board that every
mile of track owned by the system in that
county was assessed.
The petition of the Carson and Colorado
Railway sets forth the statements that Ml
miles of that road extend through Mono
: and Inyo counties, the rest being in
Nevada State; that the earnings over the
entire system in excess of all expenses
: have diminished from $47,256 63 in 1593 to !
$21,301 So in 1596; that there is a de
ficiency in interest in the past four years
of . -1,364 23, based on an abandoned debt
: of a little more than $SaoO per mile, at the
! rate of 4 per cent per annum; that the
books show an earning of IK per cent on
; the investment, but in reain> there has
been no earnings, taking into considera
tion the wear and tear of material. The
: valuation put on the road by the county is
$1500 per mile. The present valuation by 'â 
. the Board of Equalization is $2136 per mile, !
which has been maintained ever since the
; road's construction. The petition closes I
with the statement that the company will
fight the matter in the courts unless its
. valuation is reduced.
' George Fletcher appeared for the Nevada
' County Narrow-range. He stated that the ,
; earnings of the road had decreased from 5
' to 10 per cent in the last year. He said :
; that tbe -board's valuation was too hu;h
and asked a redaction of 10 per cent.

"Red Letter Days*'
How We Do It.
You are not the only gainers by "Red Letter
Days." We gain â gain trade â gain dollars.
Suppose we buy a dozen bookcases and sell
all but one or two at regular profit; can't we
afford to sell that one or two at cost, or below,
just to get rid of them ?
That's one use of "Red Letter Days" â to
clear out broken lots.
Another use is to advertise our store; get
people here who were never here before;
show them what we mean by right furniture
at right prices.

CLOSE TO DEATH'S DOOR,
Chief Sullivan Almost Run
Down by a Loco
motive.
A Hose-Cart Driver's Narrow Escape
From a Collision Wttli a
Yard Engine.
There was a small fire at the foot of
Sixth street last evening, and while in the
discharge of their duty two members of
the Fire Department had a narrow escape
from instant death or serious injury, to
say nothing of the destruction of valuable
Fire Department property.
Chief Engineer Sullivan while dashing
to the fire passed down Sixth street, and
while crossing the railroad track narrowly
escaped being run down by one of the
Southern Pacific's freight engines. Sev
eral freigb tears . prevented him from see*
ng the approach of the locomotive until
he was within a few feet of the track and
his horse could not be checked.
The Chief yelled at the horse, which
with a bound cleared the railroad track.
The engine whizzed past the Chief's bogey
less than two feet from the hind wheels.
A second later and the men, horse and
baggy would have been crushed under the
wheels of the engine and train.
The second escape was similar in one
respect. The hosecart of tbe Potrero en
| gine made a run for the tire across the
Mission marsh road and crossed tha
| Seventh-street bridge. Several empty box-
I cars were standing on the railroad track,
i and the horses dashed around these at a
rapid gait. The turn was hardly made
i when the driver found that he was about
; to collide with a yard engine that suddenly
ran out from among a lot of boxcars.
In a second he gave his horses a turn,
and not a second too - soon, for the engine
and hosecart barely missed colliding.
; Both incidents caused the greatest excite
! ment in the crowds who witnessed the
i close call the firemen had from death or
i injury.
The fire to which the run was made was
discovered in the rear of two saloons at
Â£10 and Â£12 Sixth street, and an alarm was
sounded from box ML The dames spread
! so rapidly and mounted so high that many
â¢ people expected to hear a second alarm, as
that is regarded as a dangerous locality for
a big fire to start in, but there was but
little trouble in quenching the flames
! before they could spread.
Tbe saloon at 510 is owned by E. Svillith
! and that at 512 by J. Sweetmau. The total
damage was about 1500.
It is believed that the blaze was caused
by the carelessness of several roofers, who
had been putting on asphalt roofs on the
, two buildings during the day.

H T CTION NOYKMBKK S. 1 8Â»Â«.
Sixteen to one on McKinley is what it
mean?.
tfryan is the only peacock in tbe coun
try that has two tails and both gaudy.
The proposed fusion between Democracy
and Populism is a trade in which both
sides were cheated.
California will vote with tbe business
States of the Union, for she has business
interests of her own.
Democracy ami Populism may know
where they are at. but tbey don't know
where they are going.
Tbe campaign is shaping itself into a
fight for the constitution as well as for
protection and prosperity.
There is more confusion over the
double-tailed ticker thai, there would bave
been over a double-headed one.
Having swallowed Populism Democracy
is now wondering whether it carries its
brains in its head or iv its stomach.
At present Mr. Bryan passes bis lime
singing "llow happy I could be frith
cither were t'jther dear charmer away."
It is not certain what will emerge from
the confusion of Democracy and Populism,
but whatever emerges will get hit on elec
tion day.
The business man who r.eglects to regis
ter gives the advantage of one vote to
those who are seeking to disturb business
and paralyze industry.
I'he cycler^ parade gave an impetus to
the movement for bettsr streets, which
started it briskly forward, and all progres
sive citizens should now lend a hand and
keep it moving.
Watson had great sport in ridiculing
P.ryan's pretty rhetoric when they were
in Congress together, but that was not a
circumstance to the sport he is going to
have with him now.
The Republican campaign this year will
In- one of the most notable campaigns of
education to the history of the country,
and the intelligence of the people will sus
ta ii it all over the Union.
Viewing the reratt of nominating Bryan
and Watson the betrayers of Populism
may proudly sing:
Oh, what a tangled web we weave
When first we practice to deceive.
A Georgia Populist is running for Con
gress ou the proposition that the Govern
ment should buy all tbe cotton crop for
10 cents a pound and bold it until the
manufacturers are forced to bid higher
for it.
The yontimeut of patriotism as well as
the bMfMM sense of the people is on the
side of McKinley, and la tbe combination
of the two every loyal and intelligent clti
:en finds the inspiration of a true en
thusiasm.
At the agÂ« when Bryan was showing
rhetoric in debatine societies, McKinley
was proving his patriotism on the battle
field: and tte people will not turn down
tbe soldier candidate for the sake of the
rhetorician.
Many a Democrat who would have sup
ported Bryan willingly on a platform of
tree coinage will not support him on one
which, in addition to that, denounces the
Supreme Court and tends to overthrow
the constitution itself.
By deTeloping our manufacturing inter
ests, thus keeping our gold at home, wo
can settle the money question so far as
the Racine Coast is concerned in the best
manner possible, and therefore protection
is the thing to work for.
The Democratic* party has begun this
campaign by denouncing * the only Presi
dent it has elected in thirty-six years, and
if it should succeed' in electing Bryan it
would either use him for base purposes or
abuÂ«e him as it did Cleveland.
a tor Butler, chairman of the Popu
list convention and a leading member of
the National Committee of the party, has
a deal with the Republicans of North
Carolina still to carry out, and it will be
interesting to watch him do it while urg
ing the election of Bryau.
The Atlanta Journal report* that in
Low tides County, Georgia, more than 150
business and professional men who bare
hitherto been Democrats have signed a
protest against the revolutionary platform
adopted at Chicago and- have started a
movement in the State to beat the Bryan
ticket. It seems from this that fusion is
as unpopular with Southern Democrats as
with Southern Populists.
THE REPUBLICAN POSITION.
Mr. Bryan telegraphed the l'opulist
convention: "The Republican platform
adopted at St. Louis asserts that the bi
metallic system should be restored, but
that the American people are helpless , to
bring about bimetallism for themselves
until foreign nations are willing to assist."
Better .things should be expected of a
candidate for the high office of President
of the United States than willful and de
liberate falsehood. It must be that Mr.
Bryan has read, the Republican platform.
No mun having an interest in the welfare
of the country has failed to read the dec
larations of ail the parties. Mr. Bryan
therefore telegraphed the Populist con
vention what he knew to be untrue. The
Republican platform cannot be twisted to
even make it appear as an admission that
the American people are helpless to rem
edy any economic ills that may afflict
them. , No Republican platform ever held
that the people's hands were tied and
must remain tied until foreign nations
were willing to assist in untying them.
Mr. Bryan stoops to the level of the most
disreputable of New York ward political
methods when he attempts to put the Re
publican party in the attitude of a beggar
of foreign assistance.
The Republican party's position on the
money question is veiled in no subterfuge,
nor hidden behind no mask. It is the
policy of the Republican party to increase
the foreign commerce of America to the
greatest possible volume, and one of the
more important of the things to be done
to accomplish that is a uniform inter
national' monetary system. That is, a
system which shall make redemption
money everywhere the same. Commerce
is pretty well agreed that inasmuch as it
is enlarging its proportions from year to
year the volume of money it uses in
settling trade balances should be in
creased, but the commerce of no nation
would be willing to let another Natiou
answer for it as to how much the volume
of money should be increased and of what
material it should be composed. Mr.
Bryan, however, says the commerce of
the United Slates has no business to con
sult its connections in other countries. It
must oblige them to accept a silver dollar
that is on the basis, of sixteen times as
much weight as a gold dollar, although
the actual difference might be as 1 is to 100.
The Republican party does not believe,
it knows. ';n fact, that the commerce of
other nations would rather sever ail busi
ness relations with the United States
than to submit to a proposition that
utterly ignored their rights in â  the prem
ises. Therefore the plan of be Republican
party is to call together the nations that
are interested with us in trade inter
change and agree upon a bimetallic
monetary, system, and most likely it
would be on the basis of a dollar of silver
containing sixteen limes more grains than
is contained in a dollar of gold. The Re
publican party is thoroughly committed
to establish a bimetallic system as soon as
it can be done, but it does not believe it
wise to destroy our foreign commerce,
which aggregates about $2,000,000,000 an
nually, for the sake of playing the role of
a dictator in the world of commerce, es
pecially when this country could not
maintain itself in such a role. It is the
policy of the Republican party to let the
existing monetary system stand as it is
until ail parties interested in changing it
to a pure and simple bimetallic system
have agreed upon a plan so that the dollar
that is worth 100 cents in San Francisco
would be accepted in . every other city in
. the commercial nations as possessing the
same value. Mr. Bryan's force plan would
fail ignominious);, while the Republican
party's plan will not only not fail, but it
j will increase our trade with other peoples
' many times over.
A SOUTHERN PROTEST.
Although the Atlanta Journal (Jloke |
Smith's organ) has declared for the itryan
ticket while repudiating tbe platform, it
does not undertake to conceal tbe wide
spread dissatisfaction among conservative
Democrats of Georgia in regard to it. In
the issue of July 20 it contains an account
of a big bolt of leading Democrats in
Lowndes County in that State and pub
lishes a protest drawn up by them which
repudiates tbe action taken at Chicago as
"a complete and contemptible surrender
to anarchy."
This protest was signed by more than
150 Democrats of Lowndes County on tbe
first day it was drawn up, and undoubt
edly represents the sentiment of a large
majority of the conservative people of
Georgia and other Southern States. It is
worth noting that the protest was directed
not so much against tbe piank favoring
tbe free coinage of silver as against those
which imply hostility to the Supreme
Court and a condemnation of the Cleve
land administration. Tbe protest de
clares: "We regard tbe threat to destroy
the function of tbe highest judicial tribu
nal of the Nation as alarming and ex
tremely revolutionary," and goes on to
denounce what it calls an "effort to un
dermine this bulwark of American liber
ties establisbed in the constitution of our
forefathers."
It will be seen from this that the con
servative Democratic opposition to tbe
Chicago platform and ticket is not confined
wholly to those who opDose the free coin
age of silver. There are thousands of in
telligent men to whom that issue is by
no means the most important raised by
the extraordinary platform put forth at
Chicago under the domination of Altgeld
and Tillman. They see in the denuncia
-1 tion of the Supreme Court and in the de
| vial of the right of Federal Interference to
| suppress riots and protect National prop
erty a threat against the Government
itself, and this threat they justly regard
as one which no patriotic citizen can con
! done, even to the extent ot overlooking it
' or being silent concerning it
As the voices of conservative Democrats
are Beard arising from all sections of the
Union, it becomes evident that the issue
j of the election will not be, as some gold
> standard men fondly assert, conclusive as
\ to the question of free silver coinage.
{ Thousand; of men will vote for McKinley
â  simply because he stands as the repre
sentative of constitutional government as
well as of protection and international bi
metallism. There is, in fact, no other can
! oidate fcr whom conservative citizens can
1 vote. When eveu the Bourbon Demo
crats of tbe South protest, we can be sure
that many a stalwart disciple of Jefferson
and Jackson in other portions of the Union
will unite with them in tbe repudiation of
this "complete aud contemptible surren
| der to anarchy."
A CAMPAIGN OF EDUCATION.
There never was such a demand for a
campaign of oratory and for facts and fig
ures so condensed that their meaning mar
be understood without having to wade
through a whole volume. Congressmen
who expect to have speeches that were de
livered upon the floor of the House scat
tered broadcast will be disappointed.
The people want nothing of the kind
this year, and it is better so. Tbe
people are beginning to enjoy debates on
the hustings, and the party that does not
keep paoÂ« with public icutimtnt vUI find
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 128. ISU6.
itself without votes in November. There
will be a big demand for logical reason era
in connection with hieu-clan oratory, bui
ranters and demagogues will not draw
crowd*.
The agitation of the money question the
last few years has caused hundreds of tons
of printed matter to be scattered over tho
country, and the people are satiated with
it. Now they want tbe prominent polit
ical economists of all parties to come for
ward and defend their position, and
speakers must expect to be interrupted by
very pointed questions. Evasion, bun
combe and jokes will not be accepted in
lieu of argument, nor will mere assertion
be accepted as evidence.
A campaign of oratory will necessarily
oblige each party to have the best possible
local marching clubs and other organiza
tions, for tbe success of a political gath
ering depends mucb upon the work in tbe
few hours immediately preceding the
speaking. Marching clubs in uniform are
wonderfully successful adjuncts to a mass
meeting, tbouga in this campaign as
never before the pectple will calmly and
critically listen to the orators. "Why?"
â¢'Why so?" "Prove what you say!" will
be burled at speaker-- everywhere.
PROTECTION AND WAGES.
It is surprising that the Democracy
should have so much to say about Eng
lish influence being behind the opponents
of free silver coinage independent of other
countries, when the Democratic party's
free-trade doctrine is altogether English.
As between protection and free silver in
the United States England would very
much prefer the latter. The trouble with
free-traders in this country is that they
measure the advantages that accrue to j
free imports by tbe benefits that England
has gathered from such a policy, but, in
fact, it is the most illogical position one
could take.
With the exception ot iron and tin
England imports the raw material for her
vast industrial enterprises, and hence
would very naturally want open ports all
over the world to dispose of her mill and
factory products. In the United States is
found the raw materin! that is required
for nearly every manufactured article of
commerce, and, as a matter of course, in
ratio to the ability of our own industries j
to turn this raw material into goods and
warts, do we get tbe profit that England
would make were free trade to prevail
and all this raw material sent to British
factories to be converted into finished
products and returned to us for our con
sumption. Free trade is a good thing for
England, because she does not fear com
petition in her own markets, and England
wants free trade in this country, so that
out industries could not compete with her
in our own markets.
As a matter of fact, England could not
maintain her industries under protection,
while we could not maintain ours without
it. That is the difference between the
two countries. The industrial wage
schedule of the United States would pre
clude tbe possibility of oar competing with
her in our home marcet unless we re
duced the wage schedule of this country
to England's basis. It is a mistake, there
fore to suppose that protection is for no
purpose other than to make mill and fac
tory owners rich, for, as a matter of fact,
it in to protect our wage-earner against tbe
adoption of foreign wages. Were we to
adopt the Japanese wage schedule the
United States would have no competition
in manufactured products, but it is to pre
vent that very thing that protection is ad
vocated.
TROUBLE IN MACEDONIA.
The peace of Europe is likely to be very
much disturbed over the new develop
ments against Turkish authority in Crete
and Macedonia. In the latter country a
handful of Greeks are having thing*
pretty mucb their own way, but then they
are operating in a region that is largely
settled by Greekt. Toe serious feature
about the rebellion in Macedonia is tbe
pretty well settled fact that Russian in
trigue and diplomacy are behind it,
Bulgaria doe* not appear to have any
objection to a Macedonian junta making
its headquarters on tbe frontier where it
can direct tbe movements of tbe Insur
gent?, but then, Bulgaria is thoroughly
under Russian influence, and if the Czar
is aimiug at tbe independence of Mace
donia tbe junta would very naturally feel
safe to prosecute its work. The inde
pendence of Macedonia would not only
weaken tbe Sultan's political power, but
give courage to tbe Armenians to keep up
their fight against the Turks, and it would
exert tbe same kind of an influence upon
the Cretans. The Greeks and the Chris
tians of Crete and Macedonia and all Rus
sians are of one religious faith, and their
greatest earthly object of hatred is Moham
medanism.
Tbe insurgents on the island of Crete
appear 10 be situated very much like the
Cubans, and like the Cubans, they man
age to have some arms and munitions of
war lauded wherever they like, notwith
standing the vigilance of the "mother
country." The Porte, however, seems to
have more sense that the Madrid Govern
ment, for he has appealed to the
powers to induce the Cretans to quit
lighting and acc-pt certain reforms which
he promises shall be forthcoming. But
tbe Cretans, like tbe Cubans, hare bad a
good deal of experience with "reforms,"
and they propose to establish tbe inde
pendence of their country.
Tbe grind on tbe Popnlistsof tbe South
ern States comes from tbe fact that they
have in many cases made deals with local
Republicans for State officers, and if they
now whirl in and help tbe Democrats for
tbe National ticket they will be between
tbe npper and nether millstone and noth
ing can save them when the wheel begins
to move. '
Tbe outbreak in Macedonia, following
those in Crete and Armenia, gives another
shake to the tottering power of the Turks,
and if tbe insurrection goes much further
it would seem tbe Greeks might make a
bold dash for Constantinople and pat an
end to tbe agony by taking possession of
it and re-establisiilng tbe old Greek em
pire tbe Ottomans destroyed.
Political experts declare that in tbe F.ast
the money question will be the chief
of tbe campaign at first, owing to its nov
elty, but that by the Ist of October tbe
people will begiu to understand the su
preme importance of reviving industry,
and thereafter the contest will be fought
to a linish. between free trade and rnin
and protection and prosperity.
It would be the height of folly for con
servative Democrats in tbe East to put a
ticket of their own in the field at this
juncture. Tbe only way to head off tbe
Altgelds and the Tillmana who are excit
ing the discontented elements of the peo
ple is for conservative men to unite their
forces and vote for law and order.

A Practical Lesson.
Los Angeles Time*. â¢
The wreck of the Pacific Mail steamer Colom
bia recently contained a little lesson in protec
tion for Southern California ranchers. ; Aboard
tha Colombia were ; nearly $7000" worth of
limes shipped from Mexican port* to San Fran
Cisco. The moment that -, the San Francisco
fruit merchants learned of the loss of the for
eign limes they wired San Diego dealers for all
the lemons that could be hastily gathered for
shipment on a coast steamer. Fifteen hundred
poxes were sent to Ban Francisco and sold at
high prices. Southern California grows limes
aÂ« well as lemon* ; s but with a Democratic tar
iff that causes $25,000,000 annual deficit in
the current- expanse account naturally the
market for fruit and other United States prod
ucts suffers on account of the Chinese and
other cheap labor of foreign lauds.
WHAT'S IN THE SACK?
An exchanr* tells a story of a boy who went
to market wlia a lack of rabbiu and Usgexed
around town all day. When asked by hii
mother why he had not sold the rabbits, he
said no one had asked wbat was In tbe sack.
How many merchant* are like this boy? They
have plenty of goods for sale, but fail to tell
the people "what is in the sack." If you ex
pect to sell goods in this day und age of the
world you must open your sack and keep
shouting tne merits of your stock in trade.â
Exchange.
GOLD AND SILVER.
Ex-President Harrison Discusses Our
Monetary System.
"Ever since the resumption of specie pay
ments, In 1879, the treasury baa paid gold for
greenbacks when gold was demanded, and has
redeemed in the same way the treasury notes
issued under the Sherman law." says ex-Presi
dent Harrison in the Philadelphia Ladies'
Home Journal for August. "The Secretary of
the Treasury has never exercised the discre
tion given him to redeem the latter notes in
silverâ holding that his discretion was limited
to such a use of silver as would not destroy the
parity of the gold and silver dollars. And our
Secretaries have been right, I think, in holding
that the parity of our gold and silvereoins will
be destroyed the moment the Government
takes from the holder of a greenback or treas
ury note the election of the coin he will receive
in exchange for it. If he wants golrt, and silver
U thrust upon him, the latter is depreciated
and tne former appreciated. If the holder of
a United States note cannot get gold at par ior
it he will pay a premium for the gold he must
have to pay a gold obligation. A premium on
gold would at ouce drive gold out of circula
tion, for coin that is at a premium cannot be
used in trade. No one is bound to pay gold to
the Government for any tax or other debt due
to It, So that practically the situation is this:
Tne treasury holds itself bound to give gold to
every one presenting a United States note, and
has uo way of compelling any one to pay gold
to it. Such gold as it gets comes from persons
who choose to take paper money for gold de
posited at the mints or assay offices, or to pay
in gold coins some Government tax. Formerly
all duties upon imports were payable only in
gold. Now when tne gold reserve gets low it
can only be restored by the sale of bonds, un
der the powers given to the Secretary in the
legislation relating to the resumption of specie
payments.
BARMAIDS IN ENGLAND.
The number of barmaids pure and simple
has been reckoned at between 80,000 and
80,000, and W. H. WilKins, in an article in
the London Humanitarian, tells that on mak
ing investigations he found very few who dis
liked their calling or who were dissatisfied
with their lot. He gives from his notebook
two typical cases for and against. No. 1 was "
serving-girl at one of the largest bars in the
West End and this is her statement:
Like the work? Of course I like It. she said,
â â¢and what's more it llkas me. Do you think I
â¢hould keep on with it if I didn't like lit I get
more money at this than I should at anything
elsa, and though I get a bit tired wi;n standing so
long, whan I'm off duty I can do what I pleas*, as
a girl ought to do wnen she work* as hard as I do.
Oh, of course It has its drawback*, but It's a lot
better than drudging as a a "lady help" or being
mewed up somewhere as a nursery governess or
cllck-ciicKlng with a typewriter all day lone. Any
way, 1 see life.
This with variation!, Mr. Wilkins says, was
the burden of the tale of most.
A very few others, however, took quite a
different view, and one of these also serving
at a large \YeÂ«t End barâ thus expressed her
opinion:
I don't think the work Is suitable for any
woman, at least not for any young unmarried
wotAan, and they won't employ married women In
the trade at all. The pay la well enough, there Is
nothing to grumble at on that account; and the
food is good enough, though I often have to cob
ble my dinner down so quickly that It gives me
indigestion. But the hours are much too long:
ofien on Sunday I am so done up ibat I spend tbe
whole fureuoou in bed. And the worst of It Is the
H-e itself. A girl ha* to put up with all sons ot
impudence from customers: they call It "chaff,"
and if I don't answer the loots after their folly
they go off In a buff, and that doesn't answer. I
have heard and seen things I should be ashamed
to speak of. I'm so tirvd of beiug a ton of decoy,
I'm -olng to give it no.
It is only fair to add that this witness was a
teetotaler.
A POEM ON A SILVER PLATE
It was Mr. Field's habit to write personal
verse about his children, says Martha Nelson
Yenowine in August St. Nicholas. There are a
number of scrapbooks filled with these little
poems : and quaint rhymes which have never
been seen outside of the home circle. When
Roswell Francis Field, usually called "Posey,"
was corn, Ik received many beautiful presents
from the i: jnds of Mr. and Mrs. Fieldâpor
ringers, spoons, cups and other gifts serving a
baby's joy* and needs. The one thing lacking,
his father thought, was a silver plate, which he
purchased for l'osey. For this plate Mr. Field
composed the following beautiful verse, which
whs afterward engraved in fac-simile upon the
plate: _.-"â  ,io
INSCRIPTION' FOE JIT LITTLE Â«OX'S SILVER

Unto Roswell Francis Field his father, Eupene

tember 2, 1893.
When thou shalt eat from off this plate,
I charge thee: Be thou un> pirate;
Unto thine elders at the board
Do thou sweet reverence accord;
Though onto dignity Inclined, .
Unto the serving-folk be kind;
Be ever mindful of the poor.

And all that in thy life is good.
Give thou thy hftart In gratitude.
WHAT NEWSPAPERS DO.
The newspapers really cover a wider range:
relate the daily history of more countries,
make personages much more visible, and not
infrequently narrate stirring incidents in a
style which makes them as exciting as any
adventures, either in the historic past or in
fiction. The surface of the world is spread
out before the readers of a wealthy newspaper
like a great panorama, with the advantage
that All tbe personages upon it are seen, as in
some of tbe newest photographs, in actual and
continuous motion. The world is reduced to a
staje and the observer is positively fascinated
by tbe drama going on, which being well "ren
dered" is so attractive that not a few of the
spectators become stagestruck.
MAY LOSE THEIR SHIRTS,
Jackson (Cal.) Republican.
One of Bryant's New York adherents wrote a
message on bis shirt cuff, put a postage stamp
on it and dropped it into the poatoffice. It ar
rived at its destination all right, informing
the "boy orator" that the writer was out of
paper and without a cent to buy a sheet. If ha
continues to stick to Bryan there will not be
enough of his shirt left to make a slit for a
collar-button. The whole combination will be
stark naked by the middle of next November.
SKIRT WITH BOX PLEATS.
There has been a healthy reaction against
skirts enormously full at the bottom; there are
no more eight and ten yards round, bnt there
is no change in the fashion situation which
has for the past year made plain wide skirts
the unchangeable feature of all costumes. Da
spite many efforts to introduce panels and
ttimming^ffects, tbe plain unlrimmed circu-
lar front skirt hanging extremely full holds, its
own. The box-pleated back which our ex
ample shows is its most favored form.
This model is seen in both separate skirts of
rich material > to . be worn with coat bisques
and blouse waists, and as part of costume* of
one material ; either .in combination with
Jackets for street wear or waists for Indoor use.
The pleats la the back are formed by separ
ate r ore*, the mum being hidden nadir the
folds. The front is seamless. Being cut circu
lar It is not necessary to bave darts at the top.
The only stiffening now used in skirts, and
even this is often omitted, is a five to ten Inch
facing of hair-cloth, with wirene canvan of crin
oline around the bottom. The skirt should be
lined throughout, the lining being cat exactly
like the goods.
For wash fabrics this shape is much used,
with a plain hem or facing. Tiny ruffles also
are used this season, and simulated tucks
formed of bias strips sewn through tne upper
edge by machine are new.

PEARS A DRUG
IN THE MARKET
The Jackson-Street Wharf
Crowded With the
Luscious Fruit
NO BUYERS IN SIGHT.
Trouble on the American Ship
Sterling Over the Food
Served at Port Costa.
THE CREW LEFT HER IN A BODY
Captain Johnson Left the Bark Enoch
Talbot at Ventura Because of
a Love Affair.
Pears are a drag on the market and
Jackson-street wharf is crowded with
them. The canneries do not want them,
and as there is no outside market many
of them will remain on the wharf until
they rot or are given away, as several
loads of onions were last week.
Besides the pears there are large quanti
ties of potatoes lying around, and if some
of the accumulations are not carted away
soon tbe river steamers will have no place
on which to discharge their cargoes.
Nearly all the fruit is from the Sacra
mento Valley, but the Napa City and Zin
fandel also bring considerable from Napa.
The peach crop is light this year, so there
is no surplus of that fruit, but pears are
more abundant than usual, and in conse
quence the supply far exceeds the de
mand. Every river steamer that gets in
during the day brings a load and the piles
on the wharf are constantly increasing. A
dozen teamsters are hauling the fruit
away all day, but they cannot reduce the
sue ply.
The British ships Lauriston, eighty
three days from Newcastle, Australia, and
Queen Elizabeth, sixty days from Hong
kong, arrived in port yesterday. Both
masters report light and baffling winds
throughout the entire passage. Both ves

Lauriston is loaded and the Queen Eliza
beth has a general cargo of Chinese mer
chandise.
The gasoline schooner Checto is unload

two cases of machinery, wire, pots and
pans, laaies 1 underclotning and about a
dozen sets of Waverly novels. Everything
was ruined, and, with the exception of the
machinery, will probably not bring enough
at auction to pay expenses. As soon as
she i 9 discharged the Checto will go back
for another load.
The bulwarks of the Britsh ship Cedar
bank, which were damaged during a storm
off Cape Horn, were beine repaired yes
terday. Tbe vessel seems to be unfortu
nate on her runs to San Francisco. On
the last occasion she arrived in port with
her cargo of coal on fire.
â¢ Captain Davis of the American ship
Sterling is having trouble with his crew.
While she was Joading at Port Costa the
men say they were only half fed, and they
assert that on Saturday night and yester
day morning they got nothing to eat at
all, as the vessel was in the stream and
there was no cook aboard. When it came
along toward noon the men's appetites
would not be gainsaid, so the mate, car
penter and three sailors â all the crew that
was aboardâ packed up their belongings
and came ashore. The carpenter and men
are very bitter against the| skipper and do
not mince matters when talcing about
him. They predict that if ne treats his
new crew in the manner he treated them
there will be a muting before the vessel
reaches Liverpool.
Soon after the Sterling arrived here
from New York she was sold to
tbe Alaska Packers' Association and
Captain Weldou was succeeded by
Captain Davis. The former was a uni
versal favorite, but Davis was not so well
liked. MÂ«nv of the men left the ship and
were paid off. When, therefore, she went
to Port Costa there was only a small com
plement left and the three sailors had to
take turns at doing the work of a watch
man. .
The plans of the whaljne excursion have
been changed. It will not leave San Fran

Coast steamship Queen will go out with
the Fearless, instead of the steam schooner
Albion. Instead of anchoring in Drake's
Bay at night the party will make its bead
quarters at Santa Cruz. After the whale
is captured Monterey and the wreck of the
Colombia will be visited and the entire
party will be landed in the City about
noon on the following Monday. T. C.
Wills, who is engineering the excursion,
resigned from J. C. Kirn ball <fc Co. to ac
cent a position with Goodali. Perkias &
Co. He is one of the best-known and b st
lifced men on tbe water front, and if any
body can make the excursion a success he
can. The whale when killed will be towed
to port and placed on exhibition and the
proceeds Were to go to tae carnival fund.
If the carnival should not come off the
money will be donated to the Associated
Charities.
The oil bark Enoch Talbot arrived from
Ventura yesterday in tow of the tug Res
cue. The crude material was wanted
badly at the refinery, so it was thought
be-*t to send a tug after tne vessel. Cap
tain Johnson did not come up on the ves
sel. He created a sensation in Los
Angeles by taking to sea with him ayoung
actress, who was formerly at the Orpheum,
as his wife. This gave rise to a great deal
of talk, and when the vessel left Ventura
Johnson quietly walked ashore and Cap
tain Merriman took command.

Edward Mason Swindles a
Boston Woman Out
of $ioo.
TRIED A SECOND TIME.
Told That Her Son Had Been
Seriously Injured in an
Accident
HOW THE PLOT WAS EXPOSED.
Clever Work of Inspector Munro.
Who Succeeds in Bringing the
Fellow to Justice.
Fondness for other people's coin has
been the means of bringing Edward Ma-
Everett Christie, the Man Edward Mason Claimed to Have Nursed Through â¢
Long Illness, tbe Result of a Railroad Accident.
! ton of Truckee, but temporarily claiming
i Colusa as his home, under the ban of the
; Government. He Is charged with using
i the mails for fraudulent purposes and by
| order of Inspector-in-charge Munro was
arrested yesterday. He will be brought
from Colusa to-day by a United States
deputy marshal.
The evidence in the possession of Mr.
Mnnro proves Mason to be a very smooth
citizen, thoujr.i he was a little over-confi
dent, as the after results prove.
In April last Mason, who was then liv
ing at Truckee. wrote to Mrs. Margarett
Christie of Warham, Mass., stating that
her son. Everett Christi, had been seriously
injured in a railway accident One ankle
was broken and both wrists fractured and
to the latter affliction was due the son's
inability to write. Mason assured Mrs.
Christie that her son was doing very well
under his care and further that the boy
was most anxious to get home. The letter
| wound up by requesting that $100 be sent
; at once to Mason and he would see the
'< son safely aboard the cars going to Boston
town. The writer claimed to be Sheriff of
j Nevada County, requesting, however, that
j all letters be sent to "plain James Mason,
! Truckee, Cal."
In time the money reached Mason, who
lost no time in leaving Truckee, hÂ« taking
with him a woman known in that section
of the country as Ella Raymond. To
Colusa the pair journeyed and for a time
rolled very high. Alter a few days, how
ever, Mason's coin began to run low and
he bethought himself of ways and means
to replenish his purse. He wrote to Miss
Hattie M. Cristie of Boston repeating the
old story of the railroad accident. He sup
posed that she had been informed by her
mother at Warham of the "sad affair,'
winding up with the concluding statement
that the $100 sent by her was not sufficient
to cover all the expenses. He assured tbe
sister that he had taken a great interest in
her brother, in fact had become so much
attached to him that he had kept the
"poor boy" at his private house instead of
sending him to the hospital. Mason
wound up by requesting the sr.m of $65.
tiut the sister was not so easily auped.
She was anxious to help her brother if he
needed. Dut she wanted to be sure on that
point. Accordingly Miss Christie wrote
the Postmaster at Truckee lor information
about "Sheriff Mason," and also her
brother. This little precaution brought
about the downfall of Mason. It developed,
of course, that M;ison held no official po
sition in Nevada County, and. in fact, wa3
hardly known there. The matter was at
once tnrned over to Inspector Munro, and
after several weeks he succeeded in tracing
Mason to Colusa. In tne meantime he
also found Everett Christie, the "injured"
son and brother. He has been in San
Francisco for two years, and is now work
ing as cook at Swanberg's oyster-house.
One of the peculiar phases of the case is
that Christie does not know Mason, at
least under that name. He will be at In
spector Munro's office to-day to get a good
square look at the rranwno knows enough
of his family to be able to perpetrate such
a fraud.
EDWARD WEIR AGAIN.
The Insane Peddler Who Pesters Young
Ladles With Hi* Love-Letters
Once More Arrested.
Edward Weir, a tea peddler, is at his old
tricks again of annoying a young lady by
his endearing letters.
A year ago be made life unendurable to
' Miss Denicke of Sacramento and Mason
streets, by sending her loving epistles and
then threatening to kill her. He had seen
1 the vonng lady wtile peddling tea at her
I father's honse. Finally Mr. Denicke had
! him arrested and he was adjudged insane
by the Insanity Commissioners and sent
j to Napa.
He *as released about two months ago,
I and since then he has been pestering Miss
1 Conway, a young lady living on McAllis
ter street, with bis love-letters and threats
to till. She complained to the police, and
I last night Policeman McLauehlin arrested
him and booked him at the City Prison on
the charge of insanity.

ANGRY FEELING
AMONG CYCLISTS
They Complain of the Po
lice and Manager
Vining.
FROMISES NOT KEPT.
Claimed That Orders Were to Be
Given to Stop the
Cars.
CHIEF CROWLETS DEFENSE.
He Denies Emphatica ly That Any
thing Was Said to Him About
Stopping the Cars.
An angry feeling pervades the ranks of
the bicyclists who took part in Saturday
night's parade over what they consider
the unfair treatment accorded them o_.
the Market-street Cable Company and the
police.
The managers of the demonstration say
that amole preparations had been made
for a clear route and an uninterrupted pa
rade, but the contrary was the result.
They were neglected by the police, run
into by the cable and electric cars and an
noyed by hoodlums, so that at times there
was confusion in their ranks and the pa
rade had to be broken up before the end
of the march down town.
H. F. Wynne, who has tak?n a promi
nent part in the movement for good roads
since its inception, said yesterday that he
went to Manager Vining of the Market
street Cable Company and secured a
promise that the cats would be stopped
along the route if the Chief of Police would
give orders to his mentoseeth.it the
promise was kept. He went to Chief
Crowley and the Chief informed ! im that
Manager Vining's orders would be carried
out by the police. He said that Chief
Crowley neglected to give orders to his
men to stop the cars.
Chief Crowley was seen last night, and
be gave an emphatic denial to the state
ment that Mr. Wynne or any one else had
at any time asked him to see that the cars
were stopped during the parade, or men
tioned to him anything about Manager
Vining giving a promise to that effect.
"About two weeks ago,'' said the Chief,
"a gentleman called upon me and asked
that a platoon of' police in uniform,
mounted on bicycles, should be assigned
to head the parade. I told hi in frankly
that I did not favor tbe proposition, as I
looked upon it simply as an advertising
scheme on the part of the manufacturers
of bicycles. I promised, however, to lay
the matter before the Commissioners at
their next meeting.
"The meeting was held on Wednesday
night, July 15, and I iaid the matter before
them. They declined to accede to the re
quest, believing as I did that it was simply
an advertising scheme.
"Two eentlemen called upon me the day
after the meeting and I told them of the
decision of the Commissioners, but prom
ised to have a platoon of mounted police
men at the head of the procession. I also
promised to have men along the line of tne
procession and three or four men at Eighth
and Folsom streets, which they had re
quested.
"That was all that took place between
myself and the representatives of the
demonstration. If any one says that any
thing was said to me about stopping tbe
j cars during the procession, he says what
is absolutely untrue. The word cars was
never mentioned, of that lam certain. If
any one had told me that Manager Vining
I had promised to stop the csrs I would
' have been only too happy to have given
orders to my men to see that it was kept,
as it would have made things much easier
for the police.
"It has always been the custom of per
sons in charge of a parade to bring a
I promise from the manager of the cable
! company to me and I have always seen that
het cars were stopped. But in the present
case nothing of the kind was done. I
have no power to stop the cars without
orders from the cable company.
"The cars are always stopped during the
parades on Decoratioaday and the Fourth
of July, but for other parades special per
mission has to be asked from the com
pany.
"The bicyclists may complain that there
were not sufficient police along the route,
but I did the best I could under the cir
cumstances. My experience of these night
parades in tbe past has made me careiul
not to leave the whole City unprotected
j aeainst the depredations of thieves and
! burglars. People have left their houses to
: go downtown and see a procession, and
as nearly the whole police force was there
' also the resuit was that numerous com
i plaints came in of houses having been
j broten into. That taught nie*a lesson.
"I had as many men along the line of
route as I could spare with safety to the
City, and they did t^e best they could.
i About four-fifths of the crowd was com
: posed of women and children, and the
! police could not be expected to club them
|or usÂ« unnecessary force. The police did
i all they could to subdue the hoodlum ele
! ment and arrested tnree or four of them.
'â Just let me say that if those in charge
of the parade had chosen, as they ought to
have done, the north side, of Market
street instead of the south, the trouble at
The Emporium would not have occurred,
as they would not have been compelled to
cross the cartracks."
SILENT BURGLARS
IN THE MISSION,
The Residence of Jefferson
G. James Ran
sacked.
NO NOISE WAS HEARD.
While the Family Slept Dia
mends and Other Articles
Were Stolen.
ENTERED BY A REAR WINDOW
The Police Have Been Notified, but
So Far There Is No Clew to
the Midnight Visitors.
Ex-Supervisor Jefferson G. James is
mourning tbe loss of his diamond studs
and other articles of the value of about
11000 and he is willing co pay $230 for their
return and to ask no questions.
While he and his family were sound
asleep Sunday morning visitors called at
the house, 2131 Howard street, and finding
one of the windows in the rear unfastened,
they entered by that means so as not to
disturb the sleepers by ringing the front
doorbell.
They went through the dining-room
into the hallway and ascended to the
sleeping apartments upstairs. From ail
appearances they had familiarized them
selves with the interior of the house.
Mr. and Mrs. James slept in a large
double bedroom facing Howard street and
Mr. and Mrs. Walker C. Graves in a large
room in the rear.
Mrs. James was the first to discover that
strangers had been in the house during
the night. She arose about 6 o'clock Sun
day morning and found, to her astonish
ment, everything in the room in confus
ion. Bureau drawers had been drawn
out and their contents dumped upon the
floor. Her diamonds, worth over $1000,
were kept in a chest of drawers that stood
in a corner near the bed, and to her joy
she found that they had escaped the ob
servation of the midnight visitors. They
were in the bottom drawer and evidently
by chance all the drawers had been care
fully examined except the bottom one.
Mrs. James then awakened her Hus
band. His garments, which he had placed
on a chair, Had disappeared. In the hall
way he found his shirt, but his diamond
studs, one weighing IJÂ£ carats and the
other l}Â£ carats, were gone, and so were
his diamond cuff buttons and collar but
ton. His trousers and purse were also in
tbe hallway, and $14 had been abstracted
from the purse. His gold watch, worth
$250, and two jeweled brooches had also
been stolen.
After ransacking Mr. James' room the
burglars had visited the room occupied by
Mr. and Mrs. Graves. They emptied Mr.
Graves' trousers pockets of their coin and
carried away Mrs. Graves' silk dress, which
was subsequently found in the yard, to
gether with her husband's hat. They had
taken with them, however, a fine overcoat
belonging to Mr. Graves and a brand-new
silk hat which Mr. James purchased a few
days ago.
The burglary was reported to the police
on Sunday, and detectives have since then
been working on the case. Each pawn
broKer in the City has been supplied with
a list of the stolen articles, but it is not
thought likely that the burglars will try to
dispose of the property h?re.
Mr. James said he retired about 12:30
o'clock Sunday morning and slept soundly
till awakened by his wife, who told him of
the burglary. The burglars had done
their work silently and effectively. He
congratulated himseif that his wife's dia
monds had been overlooked. He is hope
ful that the men will soon be captured.
SHOEMAKERS ORGANIZING
They Will Form a Strong Home
Industry Union This
Week.
The shoemakers of this City are organ
izing, not so much on trade-union lines as
for a united effort to induce the public to
patronize home industries.
Tbe first meeting was held last evening
at9lsVÂ£ Market street, and about fifty were
present. P. McKittrick was selected as
chairman and J. McGrane as secretary.
The latter, ir. discussing the situation,
said that in this City there are 700 shoe
makers and not over 200 are employed.
Those who are at work put in ten hours a
day at piece work, and even then there is
not sufficient to keep them busy ail of the
time. Consequently the pay is very poor.
He said :
"During the past four months several of
the larger manufacturers have closed their
factories and many of our shoemakers are
thrown out of work. The reason is that
nearly all of the footwear comes from the
East. In fact, of every ten pairs of shoes
worn on this Coast not more than one pair
is made here. It is time to turn the tide.
We have the leather here and we have the
shoemakers here. Why should the raw
material be sent East for manufacture
while our men are idle?
"Our purpose is to stimulate thÂ« spirit

of patronizing onr Pacific Coast industries,
and we will unite to this end with the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associa
tion of California. Both organizations
will work to the same end. and within a
few days we will send a committee to the
association to discass the situation. We
are sure of the support of our employers
in this move, for many of them are mem
bers of the Manufacturers' Association.
"Our proposed plan of action is this:
We will adopt a trademark to show that
the goods we turn out are of California
manufacture, and, maybe, the Manufac- ""
turers' Association's home-industry trade
mark will be made to serve the purpose.
Then we will work among the labor
unions to get their members to purchase
only eoods stamped with the accepted
trademark. In the strict sense of the
term, this will not be a trades union, for
we believe that if we can build up our
tra<Je our wages will be regulated without
any difficulties with the empioyine ele
ment. Within a montii we expect that
every shoemaker In the. City will be in
our organization and every member will
be a committee of on- to encourage the
patronage of uome industry. "
Several years ago there was a strong
shoemakers' union of 700 members in good
standine, but it was wrecked, it is said, by
scheming parties who drew the men into
troubles that might have been avoided.
These troubles caused the employers to
throw all union men out of their factories,
and the latter retaliated by purchasing
Eastern goods. Since then "the trade has
gone down, and from appearances the em

FATAL ATTEMPT
TO FORD A RIVER.
Sad Death of Amos U. Rugg,
a Prominent Mining
Man.
ALMOST REACHED SHORE
Attacked by Cramps While Swim
ming Toward the River
Bank.
GREAT MOURNING IN OROVILLE
Over Two Hundred Townspeople
Escorted tbe Remains to tbe
Railroad Station.
AmosT. Rugg, a prominent and pomilar
young mining man of Plumas County,
while attempting to ford the north fork
of the Feather River last Friday evening,
was swept from the back of his horse and
was drowned in the river in sight of a lady
companion, who looked on powerless to
aid him.
Rugg had been showing some visitors
ardind the mines and had been leading
their horses along the steep mountain
trails. Wishing to cross from Cleighton
to Cox's bar and thinking to make a short
cut by fording the stream instead of going
around by the trail, he had proposed to
the ladies to cross the river on horseback.
First, however, to make sure that there
was no danger, he volunteered to ride
across and then assist the ladies over.
Rugg rode boldly into the stream at the
point where he supposed the ford was, but
the borsd stepped into deep water and
commenced to plunge, shaking his rider
into tbe pool, which was at least twenty
feet deep. Uujrg struck out for the shore,
however, and was within ten feet of the
bank, when he was seen to throw up his
hands and then sink from sight. It is
supposed that he was seized with a cramp
and could swim no further.
The body of the drowned man was re
covered early Saturday afternoon. A
rough box was made, and about 3 o'clock
the dead man's father-in-law, J. H.
Thomas, and his brother, \V. B. Rung,
started with the body to drive to Oroville,
eighty miles away. They arrived there
about 8 o'clock Sunday morning.
Over two hundred people in Oroville,
where the young man was well known,
escorted the remains to the railroad
station. The body was forwarded to Fruii
vale, where the father-in-law of the dead
man lives.
The funeral services will be held at the
Amos I*. Rngg, Who Was Drowned While Attempting to Ford the North Fork of
the Feather River.
Brooklyn Presbyterian I Jhurch, East Oak
land, to-day at 3:30 p.m. The interment
will take place at Mountain View Ceme
tery, where the Golden Gate (Masonic
Lodge, of which the deceased was a mem
ber, and the Brooklyn Lodge of Masons
will perform the last rites to the memory
of the dead.
Amos U. Rucg was born in Compton
County, Canada. January 22, 1865, and was
raised on a larm. He graauaied with
honors from the Quebec Military College
at the age of 18. In ISB7 he came to Cali
fornia and engaged in the real estate busi
ness. In 1890 he married Miss Louise V.
Thomas of Fruitvale. His wife and two
children, a boy of 4 years and an infant
daughter, survive him.
His principal efforts for the past few
years have been in and around the great
hydraulic fields of Laporte. Plumas
County, where, with his fathÂ«i-in-law, J.
H. Thomas, he has mined successfully.
Lately he has been working the well
known rich bars on the north fork of the
Feather Riv< r in Plumas Comity.
Mr. Rugg took a promiuent part in the
organization of the Gold Bar Consolidated
Mining Company of this City.
RACING AT MONTEREY.
Society Will Witness the Different
Pony and Steeplechase
Kvents.
Down away from tbe rabble, the per
sistent and persuasive tout and the wily
boofcmtker with his hundred and one ways
of beating a favorite, Monterey will be
tbe scene next week of horse racing pat
ronized exclusively by the members of
swelldom. On August 26 and 29 the Pa
cit^r Coast Pony and Steeplechase Racing
Association will hold its third annual
meet on the association's magnificent and
perfectly appointed course.
The programme for the two days' racing
was issued yesterday, and with some five
to six events down for decision each day,
some grand sport is in store for
society. Last year the meeting was a most
pronounced success and tbe Paris mutual
boxes afforded the speculatively inclined
ample opportunity to get rid of their loose
change. On that occasion the crimson
with gold maltese cross colors of Walter
Hobart were very popular and no doubt
at the coming meet will be seen well to
the fore in the different events.
J. Talbot Clifton, he of the many ex
ploits, owner of racehorses and the coach
Meteor, was also a conspicuous figure at
the races last year and no doubt his pres
ence will be greatly missed â especially by
those looking for match races.
Entries will close on August 15 with
Malar J. L. Rath bone, president of the as
sociation, room 12, Mills building, a fee of
$5 to accompany each.

Among the professional horsemen
matter.-* are very quiet, the majority of
those in town contenting themselves with
trying to beat the tÂ»ausalito poolrooms.
From all accounts, the California contin
gent that departed some weeks ago for
Montana, are not living on turkey and
cream puffs and opening "small bots.'
Mite Hennessy, the jockey, arrived from
that section of the country yesterday, and
he stales that all the "bustiers" are wait
ing for the snow to fly in order to enable
them to return to California on snow
shoes, and that the owners from here will
soon be feeding their horses on a diet of
smelter snioke.
As to who will secure the betting privi
leges at the coming State Fair meeting is
also a general topic of conversation among
horsemen. Mucu opposition is heard on
all sides against Bookmaker George Rose,
who was the Miccessful bidder last year.
Humphrey and Harlan are mentioned as
his most formidable competitors at the
coming meeting. If either of these pen
cilers are any more liberal in their prices
than Rose they have, afier several seasons
on the block, failed to demonstrate the
fact.
Pctaluraa will hold its annual fair, be
ginning August 3, and as several running
events are down on the card a large local
following will attend tbe fair.
THE TWENTY-NINTH CLUB.
A Growinar Organization of Repub-
Means in This City.
At the executive session of the Twenty
| nrntu District McKinley Clnb, which was
; held at 733 Howard street, tbe following
j resolution was adopted :
! Resolved, That the executive committee of
the Twenty-ninth District McKinley Club ex
tend to the San Francisco Daily Call our
hearty tnauts for the stand this honorable
paper has taken in beiialf of our causa and of
j our chosen candidates for the highest positions
I of trust and honor to our Government, vix.,
: McKitilÂ«y and Hobart: also to our National

Opinions of Prominent Citizens on the
Va'ue of Holding a Grand
Affair in 1897
San Francisco will not have a carnival
this year. This was determined upon at
a meetinc of the executive committee of
the Carnival of the Golden Gate, after a
Posters That Were Submitted for the Carnival That Has Been Postponed.
long discussion of the feeling of the mer
chants who have been interviewed upon
the subject.
The idea has not been abandoned, how
ever. In April, 1897. the carnival reason
will be opened throughout the State by a
demonstration in this City, while the
aaded months of preparation will allow
the committee to arrange the details with
greater magnificence than has heretofore
been projected.
Weather Observer Hammon was before
the committee yesterday and presented
statistics about the weather. He was at
tentively listened to by the committee.
November, immediately following the
election, and February, preceding the in
auguration, were suggested as good months
in which to hold it. But Mr. Hammou's
figures were against both months, on ac
count of the rainfall record.
Carnival Director Friedlander was one
of the strongest advocates of postpone
ment. In company with several members
of the committee he has been canvassing
mercantile establishments, and nearly all
kXpresMd an opinion against the fall. He
cited the ca.Â»e of the Palace Hotel, which
woul I contribute $500 tor a fall celebration
and $1500 if it came off in the spring.
A letter from James D. Phelau was read
at this juncture. He strongly favored the '
carnival rroject as a means of bringing
people to San Francisco. "I am also of
the opinion," said he, "that the time b
too short in which to prepare a carnival
worthy of the City and State. I have con- j
suited with artists and business men. The !
business men say they do not want it this '.
year because everything is bo unsettled. !
Artists say that the decorations woold !
require many more months than you have )
at your disposal."
Henry J. Crocker also advocated post
ponement, but suggested that the uresent
organization be merged into a carnival
club to carry out the i iea.
AY. H. Mills advocated postponement,
saving, "For years the interior has monpo
lized that form of entertainment which
has become a feature of California life, it I
is the duty of the people of B*n Francisco
to get up such ai affair that we may point
the way, and let others loiiow. I trill agree
to pay my pro rata to meet expenses to !
keep the affair before the public.
The months of July and August, Feb
ruary and March were mentioned, when
the smallest number of people are usually
in the City. ISy a unanimous vote it was
decided to eelect April, and fix the date at
least ten days in advance of any carnival
in the State.
The headquarters in the Mills building j
will be retained, and the work of can
vassing continued. General Warfield is !
trying to induce a young, active business
man to take hold of the chairmanship of
the finance committee in place of R. B.
Soule, who has resigned. The party has
given a partial promise of accepting.
\V. H. Mills suggested that the support
of tue California press be enlisted in the
cause of the carnival. He was selected to
bring the matter before the papers.
Mr. Mills, who is arranging the whale
catching excursion, was before the com
mittee and offered to give toe proceeds of
the whale when caught to the carnival
I fund. His offer was accepted.
Carnival Director Fried lander, Oscar
Boldemann and R. H. Kavanaugh were
appointed to receive the designs for
; posters and bids for the souvenir pro
i gramme at headquarters yesterday. Quite
| a number were submitted, but no de
cision will be arrived at until the meeting
of the executive committee next Monday.
REPUBLICAN LITERATURE
It Will Follow the Lines of
Finance and Protection
and Soon Be Out.
The State Committees Are at Work
and the State Headquarters
Are Fall of Life.
Republican campaign literature is just
now engrossing the attention of the Re
publican State Executive Committee, and |
within a few days the campaign docu
ments which axe to be scattered widely
among the voters of the State will begin to
co forth by thousands from the headquar
ters in the Palace Hotel.
The liteiary committee of the State Ex
ecutive Committee, of which Allen B.
Lemmon of Santa Kosa is chairman, has
engaged A. J. Pillsbury, editor of the
Tulare Ke.ister, to compile tne literature i
of tbe campaign, under tbe general direc-
tioh of the committee. Mr. Pillsbury, who
will serve as clerk of the committee
throughout the campaign, is a bright and
clever writer and a man deeply versed in
political history and economic science.
The members of the literary committees
who are present in this City met yesterday
with several members of the Republican
League of Editors to further outlive the
preparation of campaign literature. A. B.
Lemmon presided at the informal confer
ence, and amonc the others present were
T. G. Daniels, editor of the Alarueda Ar
gus and president of the State League of
Republican Editors, G. M. Francis of the
Napa Register and A. J. Pillsbury.
The Republican campaign literature
to be issued will be prepared mainly along
two lines. It will present the doctine of
bimetallism from a Republican stand
point, showing the true stand of the
Republican party, which is not a gold
party, but one which favors the largest
possible use of gold and silver which can
be brought about by obedience to sound
economic laws.
Along another line the campaign litera
ture to be put forth will present the value
of protection to the country and its es
pecial value to California. This State has
many industries wnich depend mainly on
a protective tariff for their success and
prosperity, and the lines upon which pro
tection is especially desirable to California
will be clearly and forcibly set forth.
Chairman McLaugulin", Secretary Hig
cins and the other members of the com
mittee who are especially active just now
are still piving much attention to urging
registration throughout the State before
registration closes. The Republican press
of the State and the various* county com
mittees have done much toward urging
registration during the brief and curly
period in which it goes on under the new
Jaw.
The State headquarters in the Palace
Hotel are daily visited by the leading Re
publicans of the State as they happen to
drop into town. Hon. John A. Barham,
who has a practical certainty of re-electiou
in the First District, was one of the callers
yesterday. He has not yet fairly begun
his canvas, but the especial cry for protec
tion which poes up from the wool, lumber,
fruit, wine and other industries of . that
part of the State, added to Barham's record
and to his personal popularity, make his
election one of the few certainties of this
campaign.
Senator George 0. Perkins was one of
those w o dropped in at headquarters yes- i
terday. F. M. Swasey of Redding, chair- I
man of the County Committee; F. A.
Wickersham of Petaluma, chairman of
the County Committee of Sonoma County,
and O. Perrin, chairman of the San Joa
quin County Committee, were among the
caller? who met Chairman McLaughlin
and other leading Republicans, made en
couraging reports and held consultations.
J. B. Fuller of Marysville was another
prominent party man from the interior
who called. .
A. B. Lemmon, editor of the Santa Rosa
Republican, will be one of the mainstays
of the campaign and his trips to this City
will be frequent.
"Registration is being pushed very rap
idly in Sonoma County," said Mr. Lem
mo'n, "but it will not be a full registration
unless still more work is done within the
next two weeks. It is hard to get people
to understand that they must register so
much earlier than usual. We have about
9000 votes in Sonoma County, and about
two-thirds of them are registered. I do
not expect quite as large a registration as
usual, but among those who do not register
in time one party will lose as much as an
other.
"As to the political question in Sonoma
County, my observation is that there is
decidedly more disaffection among the
Democrats than among the - Republicans
on the issues of the day and that the
prospects of our party are very bright.
We have no doubt of the result in our
county. lam confident that Barham will
win his fight in the district. He will poll
the full Republican vote and he will get a
iar^e Democratic vote on account of the
issue of protection and on account of his
consistent course in Congress."

TO BE CHARGED
CRIMINALLY NOW
Proceedings Against C. 0.
Swanberg and H. W.
Westphal.
A MISSING TREASURE.
Alleged to Eave Appropriated
$60,000 of the Estate of
Louis Corriveau.
NOW SWANBEHG HAS FLED.
Westphal's Attorney Declares It Is
a Case of Blackmail That
Failed.
Criminal proceedings were begun yester
day and civil proceedings will be begun
this morning against Henry W. Westphal
and Charles O. Swanberg, in the matter of
the estate of Louis Corriveau, which, to
the amount of 160,000, the parties named
are alleged to have appropriated to them
selves.
The matter was brought before the
Grand Jury yesterday, but as it was found
impossible to go into the evidence suf
ficiently action was deferred until next
week.
Inasmuch as Swanberg has been miss
ing for a week past and is presumed to be
putting distance every hour between him
self end the City Hall, a criminal informa
tion was lodged charging him, as stated,
with the unlawful appropriation of the
money belonging to the Corriveau estate.
Under this Captain Lees immediately
began to heat the wires in his effort to dis
cover the whereabouts of the missing
Swanberg.
Henry W. Westpbal will be arrested to
day, no doubt. "At any rate," said At
torney Crittenden Thornton, in speaking
of me matter last evening, "be will not
getaway. One of them hassene; we do
not know where. Perhaps he has gone to
China.
"If he has not, if he is still in this coun
try, I think it likely we shall overtake
him. But the other one will not get away.
I am given to understand that he is mak
ing preparations to leave. If so he might
as well unpack his trunks, for he will not
get further than the Oakland ferry. I
have arranged for that.
"No, I can't go into details in the matter
now â all the facts will come out in due
time in court. I may say that Swanberg
and Westpba! are not alone in the matter.
There will be many ramifications in the
matter, and many persons, some of them
occupying more or less exalted positions,
will be implicated. We have been work
ing on this business for three weeks.
Swanberg seems to have learned what we
were doing and departed.
"They say that he is coming backâ that
he is merely making one ot his occasional
trips to Sweden. My notion is that it
would be very unwise for Mr. Swanberg to
return voluntarily. But his partner will
not get away."
Mr. Thornton stated that he was acting
in t./e matter as attorney for the Public
Administrator and for the estate. With
regard to the proceedings in the matter of
the Corriveau estate before Judge Coffey a
few weeks ago, in which proceedings both
Edna Dean, the alleged widow of Corri
veau and Westpahl testified and which
proceedings were dismissed, Mr. Thornton
said, "We secured the object we intended
in those proceedings."
Harry W- Westpbal was seen last even
ing and the intelligence imparted to him
that criminal proceedings were being in
stituted against him in the Corrivean mat
ter. He seemed very mnch surprised.
"They are carrying this thing a long
way, be said. "Well, let them. I am
not running away. lam with my family
getting ready to go over to Mill Valley for
a few weeks, but I am not avoiding any
body.
"I have done no wrong and hare no
need or intention of going away. Neither
has Swanberg. He is on bis way to
Sweden, but fully expects to return so
soon as he is through with his business
there. This Corriveau matter was before
Judge Coffey a few weeks ago, and was
dismissed summarily, there being nothing
developed on which'to proceed against me.
"My relations with Corriveau can be
briefly told. There was notning to con
ceal about them. He got into some trouble
and wanted to be secured neainst a life
insurance claim. He engaged an attorney
to look after the matter, and placed some
securities to the amount of $1800 in my
care, to meet any obligations that might
arise. No draft was made upon me in the
matter.
"Corriveau returned, but soon after
died, while I still held the securities.
Edna Dean, who claimed to be his widow,
demanded the securities of me. but I
turned them over to the Public Adminis
trator. She has been after me ever since
and has tried to blackmail me and is still
trying. But 1 will not be blackmailed.
That is all there is to it.
â¢'I never had any property of Corriveau's
in my possession but this $1800 and that,
as I say, I turned over to the Public Ad
ministrator.
"This whole thine is an outrage and a
shame. They seem to arrange to bring
these things up when Swanberg is away.
They charged him with running away in
the "Pacific Bank matter. I called "him
back by telegraph, ereatly to his annoy
ance and expense. I will not do it again."
Mr. Dorn, Mr. Westphal's attorney, who
is sick in bed at the St. Nicholas, Mid
briefly Jast night: "There is substantially
nothing to this affair at all except an at
tempt at blackmail. Mr. Wesiphai's only
offense is that he had dealings with a
man who is dead. I knew Corriveau per
sonally.
"He i. ad had an experience with a broken
banK anu had refused to intrust his money
to another. He put some of it in the Safe
Deposit vaults and sent much more of it
to Canada. When this money referred. to
here was returned to him a check was
offered.
"He refused itâ he would have no checks.
He insistea on money and money was
given him. It was for the satisfaction of
a mortgage. No leceipt was taken. It is
not the custom in such cases. I know
that there ia nothing more in this case
than an attempt at blackmail that failed. "
The facts connected with the Corriveau
estate have been made public from time
to time. Corriveau was supposed to be
quite wealthy at the time of His death, in
March, 1895." Edna Dean claimed to be
hia widow. Corriveau owned a buildina
on Geary street, between Stockton and
Grant avenue, at one time. This property
he sold for $60,000, and of this amount he
deposited $20,000 in the People's Bank.
â When tnat bank suspended payment Cor
riveau went to tda paying-teller's desk,
and at tiie point of me pistol collected
the $20,000 standing there to his credit.
Alter he died Edna Dean tiled an appli
cation for letters of administration, which
was denied, a will being found which
named Catherine Corriveau as His wife,
and made no mention of any other wife.
It appeared that Corriveau had a daughter,
Arraine Boutin, who lives at St. Anselnt.
Lower Canada. Public Administrator
Freese in course of time took charge of
the estate, and citations weie issued â¢
against Swanberg and Westphal. They '
were accused of making away with the â 
money of the dead man, which is not to ;
be tound, but no information was gained
concerning what had become of the
money, the accusation being met with a
denial.
ToÂ« daughter, Armine Boutin, em- i
ployed counsel to hunt for traces of the ;
money. C. O. Swanbere is supposed to '
have left the country. Edna Dean openly
declared at the lime of Corriveau's death
that Westphal and Swanberg were given
custody of Corriveau's $60,000 by him,
that he might escape an insurance claim
of $1600. She employed E. H. Wakeman
as her attorney, who asserted that while
not $1 could be found, Corriveau had died
worth from $75,000 to $125,000.
A Whist Club Reception^
Henry Payotof the firm of Payot, Upham &
Co. is the founder of the San Francisco Whist
Club. He has just returned from Europe and
last night a reception was tendered to him
aud his wife.
The rooms of the club, at 326 Post street,
were tastefully decorated with evergreens and
flowers. There was a big gathering of ladies
and gentlemen. Af;er the customary hand
shaking came a game of whist and asocial !
supper. It was a pleasant evening of cards, '
music and conversation.
A Boom iv New Companies.
There is a boom in new companies going
on in England. During June the average
was four companies lioated every day.
The capital called for during the first half
of l*m was $406,000,000. Sixty-tive mil
lions were for foreign Government loans,
fifty-live millions for cycling companies,
forty-five for breweries, sixty ior railroads
and forty-seven for mining companies.
Last year the capital applied for during
the same period was ?260,000,000; in 1894
it was $155,000,000, and in 1893 only
$130,000,000.
It is said that the health of the brunette
type of eye is as a rule superior to that of
a blond type. Black eyes indicate good
powers of physical endurance. Dark Dlue
eyes are most common in persons of deli
cate, refined or effeminate natures, and
generally show weak health.

OF A RABID FOX.
Anglers Who Encountered
a Very Unexpected
Surprise.
A GUEST AT LUNCHEON.
Reynard Dashed From Under a
Tree and Leaped Upon One
of the Party.
J. C. PELTIER'S NARROW ESCAPE
The Enraged Animal Fastened Its
Teeth in the Angler's Coat and
Held On Until Dispatched.
"Was I frightened? Well, I should
think I was, and who wouldn't be under
the circumstances." said Mr. Peltier, after
relating a strange experience Le had while
While Seated on a Tree Stump Just Before Having Lunch on Calaveras
Cr^ek a Fox Jumped on Mr. Peltier and Fastened Its Teeth Into the
Angler's Coat.
angling for trout last Sunday on Calaveras
Creek in Alameda County.
The pleasure party was composed of L.
H. Pock man, j. C. Peltier and Charles
Hiser, all of whom are passionately fond
of angltne.
Sunday morning, bright and early, the
three disciples of Walton tramped over
several miles of to reach a favor
ite fishing-ground near the headwaters of
Calaveras Creek, a stream which gives
good fishing during some months of the
year.
At noontime, when the inner man re
belled against the forgetfulness of the an
glers, who were oblivious of everything
excepting trout, Mr. Pockman suggested
that a rest and a little luncheon would
materially aid all concerned in the angle
in making better time on the home jour
ney. Pehier and Riser readily acquiesced
and an old tree nump was selected as the
nio-t suitable place upon which the lunch
could be sp:ead.
After the napkins had been neatly spead
over the dead redwood the gentlemen eat
smilingly down to the mess, and just as
they commenced to sample some pre
serves, which Mr. Riser had purchased
specially for the occasion, out sprang a
gray fox from under the log. and singling
out Peltier, he leaped at the angler's neck.
The animal fell slightly short of the in
tended mark, but fastened its teeth firmly
in the lapei of Peltier's hunting-coat.
The angler vainly tried to shake rey
nard off. Pockman grabbed the fox by
the tail, while Riser, in his excitement,
upset the disnes on which the pies were
placed and everything was confusion.
''Pull him off! Pull him off!" shouted
Peltier, while the perspiration rolled from
his forehead.
Pockroan in the meantime was strain
ing every nerve in the vain endeavor to
break the hold the fox bad taken of his
companion's hunting coat.
Riser was completely tangled up. He
had lost his equilibrium for the time being
and was runnine around the tree stump in
the hope of finding a cannon or some big
implement of torture with which he could
dispatch the unexpected and unwelcome
visitor.
Pockman finally grew tired of pulling at
the tail ot reynard, and lell upon the
ground exhausted. A lucky thought for
tunately flashed through his mind. He
remembered that in the bottom of his fish
basket wai what midwinter anglers term
a "roeknife." an implement which some
lishermen use for "dissecting" salmon roe.
The knife was used to good advantace
on the wild animal, which, however, held
a firm grip on the aneler'i coat until dis
patched.
Tne fox was packed by the fishermen to
a farmhouse which thay had made their
headonarters, and yesterday the carcass
was snjpped to this City. Mr. Peltier in
tends having the body of reynard
mounted, and with that object in view the
carcass was given to a taxidermist.
The anglers cannot understand why the
fox should have attacked them in Â«nch a
stranpe manner, but they learned yester
day that foxes and coyotes of this State
are frequently attacked with hydrophobia
airing the summer season, and in all
probability the animal which fastened its
teeth in Mr. Peltier's coat on Sunday last
was afflicted with the malady.
For Large Damages

IMPROVING ALT A SQUARE.
The City'a Park in the Northwestern
Section Being Made Attractive.
Alta Square, between Jackson, Clay,
Steiner and Scott streets, is being very
much improved, and is being converted
into a site that is attractive to the eye and
an ornament to the northwestern part of
the City.
A new sidewalk ha? been' laid along the
Clay-street front, a new wall has been
built on that side, the slopes are being
graded, and some of tbem have been sown
with Kentucky grass, which has sprouted,
Riving the north side of the square the
appearance of well-kept terraced lawns.
''One ana a half years ago," said James
Cronojjue, the foreman gardener, who
now has nine men under him, "this was a
desolate-lookine spot, covered with weeds,
but in time the slopes were graded and
covered with three coats of fertilizing
matter that 1 obtained without cost to the
City. I made arrangements with the Fire
Department house and the owners of
private staoles in the vicinity to have the
staDle refuse dumped on the square by the
scavengers hired to remove it. In this
way I have secured about seventy-nve
loads a week and then covered several Â«
the slopes, which were then sown with
crass that has come up and is very thrifty.
The other slopes will be graded and planted
with grass and made as beautiful as these
are now. Three hundred and fifty MoDte
rey cypresses have been set out on the
graded slopes and as many more will be
planted as soon as the other grades are
ready. By the aid of the men under me
KUttervrays at the base of each slope have
been laid"in cement to prevent damage by
the rains of vinter."
The people in the vicinity are proud o.
the work that has already been done on
tne square, from which a most beautiful
panoramic view of the City can be ob
tained.
PUNCHBOWL, OR WHAT?
Mrs. Perley's Magnificent Dona
tion to the Woman Suf
frage Cause.
Proceedings at Yesterday Morning's
Meeting of the Joint Campaign
Committee.
A large and enthusiastic crowd of ladies
attended yesterday morning's meeting of
the joint campaign committee of the
Woman Suffrage Association, held at the
Woman Suffrage Bureau in the Parrott
building. Among those present were:
Mrs. Ada Van Pelt, Mrs. Nellie Holbrook-
Blinn, Mrs. Hester A. Harland, Mrs. Sarah
B. Cooper, Mrs. Ella C. Sargent, Miss
Harriet Cooper, Mrs. Austin Sperry, Mrs.
Mary A. Swift, Mrs. Ida A. Harper, Miss
Mary G. Hay, Miss Elizabeth Sargent and
Mrs. Emma B. Sweet.
Mrs. Harper reported that since she had
issued her list of papers which bad come
out in favor of woman suffrage a large
number of journals whose names hao been
inadvertently omitted had written to her
complaining of the fact.
"Tne only thing I can do is to get up
another liet, said' Mrs. Harper, "and I'm
| afraid it will be ten times as lone as the
i first."
'â¢In the meantime," added Mrs. Swift,
"since so many papers have followed The
Call's example and come out for suffrage
; our beat course would be to give a vote of
thanks to them in a lump."
And it was so ordered, Thb Call and
! its suffragist contemporaries being cheered
to the echo.
A vote of thanks was also tendered the
; management of the Cuautauqua assembly
at Monterey, in acknowledgment of its
! kind court-sy to the saffragist speakers
i and delegates on the "woman's day."
Then Miss Hay, with all due impress
| iveness, unveiled the piece de resistance
i of the oay amid many "ohs" and "ahs" of
| admiration. It was a truly exquisite worit
!of ceramic art. Some would call it a
i punebbowl and cups, others a lemonatie
I set. But whatever it be, it was voted a
: beauty by acclamation. The bowl, hos
! pitably wide and deep withal, is hand-
I painted within nnd without in a graceful
i tangle of wild grapes, the van-colored
leaves glowing wi'.h rich, warm tints, sug
gestive of generous Southern vintages, and
half veiled by lace-like spider webs.
The brim and base of this miniature sea
ot liquid joy are girt about with wide
bands of lustrous gilding, elaborately en
grossed in a flowing design of lptrirate
scrollwork. As for the cups, one of their
best features is their s:ze, there being
notbine small about them. They have
flaring brims and dainty gilded handles,
bring decorated so as to harmonize with
the design on the bowl. The set is the do
nation of Mrs. Perley, whose handiwork it
is, and she may well be proud of it.
As the gift was presented in aid of the
cause, the question as to its most ad
vantageous disposal was discussed at Â«ome
length. It was at last decided that it
should be voted for, or rather that any
person willing to deposit 10 cents in the
contribution-box would have the right to
I cast a vote for the one to whom in his or
| her opinion the gorgeous punchbowl
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 28, 1896.
ought to go. Sad to relate, "repeating"
wili be not only permitted but encouraged,
each voter being allowed to vote as many
times as he can raise the fee. No dime, no
vote, is to be the rule, and as some will un
doubtedly cast a hundred or more votes
for one favorite candidate the amount
realized for the campaign fund promises to
be large. _
SUSPICIOUS FIRES.
Fire Marshal Tone Investigating Into
Causes of the Losses In a Millinery-
Store and Tannery. -â¢
Fire Marshal Towe is investigating into
the cause of two fires, which have been
reported to him as having occurred under
suspicious circumstances.
There was a fire in Adcock's millinery
store, 10 Kearny street, early Saturday
morning. Captain Comstock of the Fire
Patrol > found a pas jet burning against a
partition and another eas jet was at full
cock: The escaping gas coming in contact
with the light bad caused an explosion.
The Fire Marshal has summoned Mrs.
Adcock and others employed in the store
to appear before him to-day and make
sworn statements as to what they know or
do not know about the fire. The stocs was
insured for $7000.
The other fire was at Frank McAleer's j
tannery on Twenty-sixth and Hampshire |
streets Sunday night. The Fire Marshal
learned yesterday that McAleer had no
insurance, as the underwriters had with
drawn their policies last June when there
was a fire in the place. What the Fire
Marshal wants explained is McAleer's
alleged statement that the tire was the
result of spite work. â¢ â¢
FARM FOR THE ORPHANS
Plan to Pay for the Site by
One Dollar Dona
tions.
Pitiful Story of Two Boys 9 and 10
Years of Age Who Had Never
Been Taught a Prayer-
There was a special meeting yesterday
afternoon in the parlors of the residence of
Mrs. Chester L. Smith, at 2613 Pacific
avenue, of ladies interested in the San
Francisco Presbyterian Orphanage and
farm located in San Rafael.
Mrs. P. D. Browne, the president, occu
pied the chair.
Rev. Mr. McDonald of the advisory
board gave an account of bis recent visit to
the home, declaring that it was one of the
most happy homes for children who are
left to the care of strangers that 5? had
ever seen, and he also spoke in high terms
of those in charge of it. He then spoke of
the site near San Anselmo which has been
selected for the future home and said : "I
have been all over the State of California
and have never, seen a more beautiful spot
or one better suited ior the purpose of es
tablishing a home such as it is intended to
build there."
Mrs. Browne said it had always been her
belief thai the country with the beautiful
surroundings of nature aud the influence
of Christian teachings was the best place
for the bringing up of children, and that
the place proposed to be secured is under
the shadow of the magnificent Theological
College, and that no better place for carry
ing out the purposes of the managers could
be found anywhere. The board, she said,
will not incur any obligations tintil the
land is paid for. Then it will erect a com
fortable building, and in time, a more sub
stantial one.
Miss Edgington, the matron of the
home, pave a brief report of the borne,
which now has seventy-four inmatesâ all
it can accommodateâ forty of which are
under 5 years of age, twenty are between
that age and 12, and four are over 12. The
children are all healthy, have plenty of
plain food and are content. All of those
who are able to attend the public school
have made good records, a number having
at the close of the last term been honorably
promoted. She spoke of the lack of chairs
and oenches, and sheeting for the beds,
and stated that for the seventy-four
children there are bat sixty-nine bowls,
bat under the circumstances, those in
charge make cups supply the deficiency.
6he acknowledged the contribution of a
quantity of sugar from Mr. Spreckels, soap
from Robert Lucy, a bolt of muslin from
Hale Bro*., and a bundle of brooms from
Arraes & Daliam. The children, she said,
want to keep ciean, "but," she added, "it
requires a great deal of soap."
One of the ladies promised a further con
tribution of that useful article, and another
promised benches.
Mrs. Browne called attention to two
boys who had been received at the home
recently, saying that they had been res
cued from evil influence, ana Mrs. Evlging
ton added that they were ignorant of their
letters, haa never "been taught a prayer
and until last Sunday had never seen (he
inside of a church. The boys are aged 9
and 10. "It is pitiful," said Mrs. Browne,
"that such things can be in an enlightened
ace in a Christian country."
After Miss Edgington had taken her de
parture Mrs. Browne spoke of the young
lady's qualifications for the position she
nils and cited an instance to show her
self-denial and interest in the work. "Mrs.
Noble, tne treasurer, and I," she said,
"saw that Miss Edginttton contented her-
I self with the food that the children re
ceive and feeling that she ought to be al
lowed a few extras, for she receives but a
very small salary, so small that I do not
care to name it, we told her that she
would be given $5 a month more. She re
plied that she would not accept it because
the home needed it more than she did."
Mrs. Browne drew attention to an illus
trated article descriptive of the home,
wnich appeared in The Call a few weeks
ago, and said that from the, number of let
ters received it was evident that it had
been extensively read.
Tne president' then outlined the plan by
which it is proposed to raise money to pay
for the land selected, and that is to have
6000 persons in the State contribute $1
each, have as many as will contribute $10
each, and as many as can contribute $25
each; aud in addition it is proposed to
ask a contribution from every Sunday
school ch.ld.
The party from whom it is proposed to
purchase the farm will donate $200; others
tiave promised about $200, aud at the
meeting about $60 was piedged.
At the next meeting of the board the
subject will be further discussed, as the
first payment on tne land must be made
within thirty days after that meeting.
ROUGH ON CATS.
Sad Fate of a Furry Pet at the Hands
of Weatern Addition Boya.
Mrs. Christina Whitney of 1201 Webster
street has, or rather had, a cat by which
she set great store. On Sunday the petted
feline was reposing in a warm corner of
the porch when three boys named Claire,
Whelan and Dixon, accompanied by two
dogs of similar proclivities, compassed the
poor animal's death. When Mrs. Whit
ney complained, the boys told her they
intended to kill every cat in the vicinity
in the same manner. The lady has taken
out warrants for their arrest.
Insane From Drink
Mrs. Johanna Rodenburg, 110 Hyde street,
told Judge Joachimsen yesterday that she was
mortally afraid her husband, J. A. Kodenburg,
would kill her. He had been drinking of late,
and it had made him crazy. He bad while
drunk always threatened to kill her. Yester
day morning she was bo afraid he would
carry out his threats that she had to leave the
house. At the suggestion of the Judge she
â  wore to a complaint charging her husband
with insanity.

WAGNER SPRINGS
A BIG SURPRISE,
Sensation in the Meeting,
of the Board of Su
pervisors.
YEAELY ALLOWANCES.
A Committee of the Whole Will
Handle Them This
Time.
FINANCE COMMITTEE IGNORED
Money Left From Last Fiscal Year
Transferred to the Funds for
the Present Term.
The members of the Board of Super
visors were treated to a genuine sensation
yesterday when, at the close of the meet
ing alter sonis of the Supervisors had
gone. Supervisor Wagner offered a resolu
tion that will overturn one of the oldest
ana most sacred customs of the City
Fathers.
From time immemorial the matter of
fixing the appropriations for the various
I municipal departments has been in the
' hands of the Finance Committee, and the
findings of tbat body hare been accepted
by the board.
Mr. Wagner* resolution was ' to the
effect that the board should meet as a
committee of the whole on Wednesday
; morning next at 10 o'clock to discuss the
I appropriation matter. Of course this was
I a direct slap at the Finance Committee,
! which is composed of Supervisors Taylor,
i Hobbs and Benjamin, but it was carried
nevertheless, Mr. Benjamin, who was in
the chair, voting with the majority to take
the matter out of his own hands.
Just why Supervisor Wagner should
have-introduced such a measure seems to
be a mystery to those who opposed it.
j Supervisor Dimond, while not a member
of the Finance Committee, took up ihe
j cudgel for that Dody aud declared tnat it
; was an insult to take the matter out of
its bands. Mr. Hobbs voted with Mr.
I Dimond after expressing the same idea
j about the resolution.
The National Club sent in a petition to
be permitted to give a boxing entertain
ment between now and .November 1, no
j contest to exceed ten rounds. The matter
j was referred to the Health and Police
Committee.
The protest of the property-owners on
{ Minna street, oetween First and Second,
against the laying of artificial stone side
walks was rewarded by a six months' ex-
I tension of time.
A resolution was adopted transferring
j $150,000 from the funds of the fiscal year
UM-M to those of 1595-96 for the purpose

ROUTED BY MOSQUITOES
A Plague on the Residents of
Hyde and California
Streets.
The attention of the Board of Health
has been called to that neighborhood of
which tbe intersection of California and
Hyde streets is tbe hub.
For more than a month swarms of mos
quitoes Jiave night and day made the lives
of the residents in that section almost un
endurable.
Mosquitoes are almost unknown in this
City and their appearance in such quanti
ties brought about an investigation.
It was generally belived that the pests
were bred in tne immense water tajik on
the roof of the Hyde-street car power
house, but the impression was removed
alter careful inspection. The tanks, how
ever, were found to be in such slimy con
dition that even if they are not the birth
place of the mosquitoes they certainly are
elegant refectories wherein to fatten them
and make them more robust.
The health officers discovered that the
swarms descended from the north on Hyde
street a little before nightfall, and traced
them to a grove of eucalyptus trees near
Clay and Hyde, their birthplace. The
pests, however, migrate daily to the
very great discomfort of the residents on
their route.
The various boarding and lodging
houses in the vicinity have lost several
guests because of tbe pest, and other sim
ilar houses have suffered to a greater or
less degree.
The question now is: How are the pests
to be got rid of?
Mr. Katz, proprietor of one of the board
ing-houses, will probably purchase the
eucalyptus grove and destroy it.
The only otber plague spot in the City
wnich is known to the^Board of Health is,
strange to say, that gore formed by the in
tersection ot Geary and Market streets â
the Adam & Kibbe property. Charles
Newman, the lessee, lost one of his ten
ants in the basement about two months
ago on accouat of the defective sewerage.
The mosquitoes found this a great breed
ing place and time has brought no im
provement.

TO REMOVE ALL
UNUSED TRACKS
The Merchants' Association
Intends to Take
Action.
ARE INVESTIGATING.
Declares That the New Charter
Will Settle the Dif
ficulty.
BICYCLISTS ALSO INTERESTED.
At Present They Are Compelled to Ride
Over Many Unused Track
Crossings.
The Merchants' Association is soon to
begin a fight to have taken up the blocks
of unused 6treetcar tracss which disfiguie
the streets in every part of the City. The
Crossing at Fourth and Market Streets, Where the Old Horsecar Rails Have Been Left Standing Several Inches Above the Cable Tracks.
[Eeproduced from a sketch by a "CalV artist.]
matter was broueht up before the associa
tion by Joseph Siraonson, president of the
California Gas Fixture Company, and was
referred to Ernest McCnllough, the engi
neer of the association, for investigation.
Engineer McCallough has been busy
making a map of the City showing the
blocks of tracks, principally old horsecar
tracks, which have been abandoned.
Among the many streets on which un
ufeed tracks lie at present are Bush street
along its entire length, six blocks on
Mason street, five blocks on Taylor, three
blocks on Pine, three blocks on Stockton,
three blocks on Fir3t and three blocks on
Battery. Besides these are various aban
doned" dummy lines in the Richmond dis
trict and several deserted lines in the
Mission.
Engineer McCullough made a partial
report to the association at the last
meeting, but the complete report will
probably not be ready until the next
meeting, a week lrom next Thursday.
Besides finding the number of blocks of
unused tracks, the engineer is ascertain
ing the number of years the different
franchises have to run. Upon the pre
sentation of the rec >ri the association will
probably take some action in the matter.
"These abandoned tracks," declared
Secretary Freud of the Merchants' Associ
ation yesterday, "not only present a dis
gracelui appearance, but "are an injustice
to pedestrians and riders, and it seems a
shame that the companies should be al
lowed to keep the tracks down merely to
shut out competing lines. As soon as En
gineer McCullough makes his report the
association will take some action in the
matter.
"If, however, we find that we cannot
compel the companies to take up the
tracks we shall direct our energies toward
securing the adoption of the new charter,
which provides for such a matter. The
new charter provides that ail franchises
not in use a year after the charter goes
into effect shall become null and void, and
that within six months after the granting
of any franchise the road must be in op
eration. This would effectually prevent
auy such condition of affairs as that
which exists at present."
The wheelmen of this City will be, per
haps, most nearly affected by the removal
of the unused horsecar tracks. At present
there are a lar.e number of old' tracks
crossing thoroughfares along which thou
sands of cyclers travel daily. These are
not only an inconvenience, but a positive
danger to. riders. One of the most dan
gerous crossings is at Fourth and Market
streets where the old horsecar tracks
cross the cable tracks. Although most of
the rails were taken up between the cable
tracks and the sidewalk the rails between
the cable tracks were loft. In places they
stand three or four inches above the cable
tracks, makiug it very dangerous for pass
ing cyclers.
The same disgraceful state of affairs
t>rÂ«!^aiis at the croaking* of First, Sixth
and many other streets. In the event of
the repaying of Market street, which, it
has been estimated, would cost about
$150,000, many or the obstructing tracks
woiiiu probably be removed.
"This is a matter which concerns not
only wheelmen but everybody in the
City," declared Henry F. Wynne, chair
man of the highways committee of the
local division^ of the League of American
Wheelmen. "While it is a good thine; for
the Merchants' Association to take steps
to hare these unused tracks removed,
still it seems to me that it is the duty of
the Superintendent of Streets to attend to
the matter."
CLUBS AND FIGHTERS
The Manhattan Athletic Club Gives
an Excellent Entertain
ment.
The Manhattan Athletic Club gave an
interesting entertainment last evening in
its rooms at 1749 Mission street. James
Killeen, who ac:ed as master of cere
monies, acquitted himself creditably. The
evening's sport commenced with a slack
wire performance by Jim Irwin. Then
Dan Kemp, the club's orator, addressed
the meeting. Paul Bernhardt gave an
interesting exhibition of club-swinging.
William Lemore's trapeze act and W.
Lenoe's contortion act were highly ap
preciated. The boxing was, of course,
the principal feature of the evening's
sport.
The following athletes met in bouts of
short duration: James and William Britt,
the Louis brothers, Cuneo brothers, Joe
Linehan and J. Crowley, J. Kenney and
J. Riley. A. Plantages and F. bhoentield,
J. McDevitt and J. Devine, James Lucey
and Gus Muller; wrestline by Vincent
White and J. Cook. George Mertes and H.
Hoffman, T. L 3 nch and J. Casey. Th^
club will hold a feather-weight cUampion
ship tournament on the evening of AuenÃt 1
The Olympic Club's boxing entertain
ment which will be held on Friday even
ing next gives every promise of being a
most successful affair. The boxers who
are booked to appeal are all in splendid
condition, and unless something very un
foreseen happens between now and the
evening of the exhibition that may debar
any of the boxers from participating, the
members can look pleasantly forward to
seeing one of the best shows ever held in
the club gymnasium. '
Justin Gibbs of the National Club re
turned last evening from Bartlett Springs
looking as fresh as a spring salmon. He
I was .very much surprised to hear that
I neither of the clubs which had licenses to
j give boxing exhibitions had, as yet, se
j cured the Maber and Choynski fight. He
said that he proposed to take things easy
for some time and would make no particu
lar endeavor to pull the National Club on
top of the heap until: he discovered how
the land Jayâ pugilistically speaking.
Yonng Mitchell of trie Occidental Club
is authority for the statement that Pitz
patrick and "Kid" Lavigne will arrive
from the East within two weeks. He says
that Lavigne and Everhart have agreed to
box ten rounds before the Occidental Club
some time during the latter part of Au
gust, and that the winner will receive 50
per cent of the gross receipts of the bouse.
Mitchell will leave for the country in a
I few days to recuperate and gain strength
for the management of the ; next fistic
. entertainment. ';â¢
Peter Maher is angry. He says neither
Choynski nor any other, man can force
him into a fight here if he can do better in
the East.
"I don't care a cent whom the clubs
throw up ; against me, if they put up
j enough dough for a mill," said Peter, as j
1 his dark eyes flashed at the; thought of
I having to return East without a big pot of
I money. \
"If Choynski intends to remain here he
j can do so, "^continued the Irishman, "but
he will loose a good thing by fooling his
time away in this City of small nurses. I i
can have a go with Charley Mitchell in
Aew York, and I'll wager that the house
will bring us $10,000, and Mitchell is a
back number at that.. Mr. Connolly and
myself will taxe the first train out for New
York on Thursday, and you can bet that I
won show up in this City again in a |
hurry, unless a solid guarantee fund is de
posited in some bank that the fight comes !
offâ that is, in ! case 1 should be matched :
against some of the big 'uns."

FRAUDS TO OBTAIN
ELECTION WORK.
Many Men Are Registered
From the Wrong
Precincts.
GRAND JURY NOTIFIED.
T. J. L. Smiley Springs a Sen
sation Before the Com
mission.
NUMEROUS PROTESTS FILED.
Many Recent Appointees Were Dis
missed for Various Irregu
larities.
T. J. L. Smiley, who represents the Re
publican County Committee before the
Election Commissioners, sprung a sensa
tion in the meeting of the board yesterday
when he announced that it had been dis
covered that certain men who had been
named for election officers, in their efforts
to reach those positions, had registered
from precincts in which they aid not re
side, and in doing Â«o had committed per
jury. He mentioned the names of H. W.
Holman and L. Fenstermacher as among
those who had registered from the wrong
precincts.
Consternation was written on the faces of
the Democratic officials on the board when
he announced that there were also a large
number of others on tne list who had been
reported to have sworn falsely as to their
residence and that they would be charged
as fast as investigation proved that they
were not legally registered.
The Commissioners were prompt in their
disavowal of any intention of allowing
any Dot the proper persons to be ar>
pointed, and Registrar Hinton was in
structed to investigate, and if any false
registrations were found to call the atten
tion of the Grand Jury to the matter and
see that prosecutions wore begun.
It was reported that George McWhin
uey, an election officer in the Twenty
eighth district, had registered from Irving
M. Scott's residence, and the Registrar
was instructed to investigate the matter
with a view to McWhinney's prosecution.
Objections were filed a-ainst the follow
ing: election officers, some of vWiom do not
reside in the precincts in which they were
appointed, and otuers served on boards
that were guilty of irregularities at the
last election : Paul Andoretti, 535 Vallejo â¢

Richard J. Rice, 2903 Baker; Thomas
Burke, 1616 Stockton ; J. B. McLeran 22
Trenton.
The following, who had been appointed
election officers, were dismissed for vari
ous reasons: T. Sullivan, Tenth of the
Thirty-first; J. Livingston, Seventh of ttie
Fortieth ; L. Conart, Ninth of the Fortieth â¢
Louis Burner, First of the Thirty-first-
M. J. Foley, Seventeenth of the Thirty

Fortieth; T. Barker, Twelfth of the
Thirty-first; T. G. Tracey, Fifteenth of
the Thirty-first; Georgn Coiiopy Six
teenth of the Thirty-first.
After the meeting Auditor Broderick
Children Cry for Pitcher^Castoria.
stated that one of the principal reasons
why names of those who were not en
titled to be appointed election officers had
crept into the lists was because the matter
of finding out whether those on the lists
were eligible had been referred to Sam
Braunhart, aad that he bad reported
them as all right when, as a matter of
fact, many of them were not. The follow
ing election officers were appointed :

Fortune Awaits Them.

only knew it, but they evidently do not, for
they have not appeared to claim it. Twenty
years ago they left their native country for
this City, and shortly alter their arrival started
for the mines, but where is not known, as they
have never been heÂ«rd of since. J. F. Ander
son of 1209 Florida street has advertised for
them in The (.all.

I W. M. HINTON, Registrar of VotVfrs*A BUSY DAY FOR
THE MINISTERS
Excellent Papers Read Be
fore the Local Organ
izations.
A TALK BY BLACKHURST
Mr. Strauss Speaks on "Christ
the Inspiration of Modern
Art."
DR. C. C HERRIOTT'S NEW PLAN
Professor Josiah Keep Highly Appre
ciates David for Penning
Psalm CIV.
Yesterday was ministers' day. The
various local ministerial organizations
met in regular conclave and discussed
many questions of interest in the fold of
the Good Shepherd. All these sessions
were marked with an activity out of the
ordinary.
At the Congregational Monday Club,
which met in the parlors of the" Grand
Hotel, the principal item was the reading
of a paper by Meyer Strauss, entitled:
"Christ the Inspiration of Modern Art."
Inspiration he beld to be something higher
than mere impulse. He treated it as an
impulse of a peculiar kind, one in which
the action of the brain is guided by an
ertraneons force, by the power of the
Divine will.
"Some men," he said, "are so practical
and so thoroughly imbued with business
principles that the sight of a beautiful
forest with it patriarchal, moss-bearded
sentinels, its wealth of green foliage sway
ing to and fro in the breeze, and its ever
changing tints as the sunlight is reflected
from the shining leaves, awakens in them
no thought but the value of the timber
contained therein. Buch men see only the
gold in the majestic mountain peaks and
the money ralue of the flocks and herds
grazing in the green pastures."
Truth he thought beautiful in contrast
with falsehood, and believed the nearer
one comes to truth in such degree one ap
â¢ nroaches the beautiful, and that tbe man
with the love of God in his heart is never
blind to the glories of nature.
A free discussion followed the reading
of the paper. By many it was heartily
commended, and criticized by a few*.
Rev. John Currie then dwelt at nome
length on his work as an evangelist. Visi
tors at this meeting were the Rev. Mr.
Taylor of Santa Cruz, the Rev. Mr. Cross
of Saratoga and tne Rev. Mr. Goodsell of
Lodu
The Presbyterian Ministerial Fnion of
this City was entertained at the Board of
Foreign Missions on Sacramento street by
Professor Josiah Keep of Mil!" Seminary,
who read a paper entitled "The Natural
ists' Psalm." The paper had reference to
Psalm CiV, and was listened to intently
. by all present.
Tlie essayists spoke of the poetic fervor
and love of nature with which David was
imbued, the geological manifestations, up
heavals and great changes made in the
preparation of the earth for its inhabi
tants, and ended his dissertation as fol
lows:
"In the sunshine, in the mountain, in
the grove, in the pca â in all of these let us
recoenize frequently the workings of Je
hovah. Let nature be studied with a de
vout and joyful spirit. Let these thouchts
lead us to be glad and sing praise while we
have any being, and may our meditations
â¢be sweet both to ourselves and to him,
whose we are and whom we serve."
Dr. C. C. Herriott of Minneapolis fol
lowed with a discussion of the Bible and
biblical institutions. He said he desired
to found here an institution similar to the
Chicago biblical institution.
The idea was very favorably commented
upon, and a week from Monday wa* named
as the day on which the union would be
pleased to have him elucidate his views on
the suoject and to consider vis proposi
tion.
Rev. Dr. Farrand of the "Howard Presby
terian Church stated tbat next Monday
would be "quizz" day, and the meeting
would be under the diretion of Rev. Mr.
â  Jenks, associate pastor of the First Presby
terian Church.
The Methodist preachers' meeting in the
German lecture hall of the Y. M. C. A.
feuilding was enlivened with an address by
Major iilackhurst, who spoke on the nevv
Volunteer movement in the Salvation
Army.
He said the intention is to reach the
masses outside the pale of Christian influ
ence, and in this they expect to be as ag
gressive as in the old movement.
Then he explained the cause of the se
cession ard emphatically stated that the
Volunteers are not antagonistic to the
Army proper, and that there is
no unfriendly spirit existing between the
two.
"The property of tie Volunteers," he
rontinued, "is not to be centralized in one
man, but will be incorporated and become
distinctly an American institution."
An appeal by letter from Mr. Nardi, one
of the Italian missionaries in this City,
was read, asking for assistance in his la
bors. The following resolution was offered
by Rev. Dr. J. D. Hammond and was
unanimously adopted :
Retolvert, That the president be requested to
write Bishop Newman sotting forth the neces-
Fity:of theltalian work in California, and urg
ing an appropriation by the missionary board
for the work.
Reports were made concerning the col
lections made to pay up the debts of the
home and foreign missionary societies.
The collections aggregated a considerable
sum.
Then followed a general discussion of
cbnrch topics in which most of the pastors
of the bay district participated.
AGAINST THE CHARTER.
The Municipal Reform League
Advises Citizens to Make
Haste Slowly.
Arguments Directed /gainst tbe In.
trodactioi of One-Man Power
Into C;ty Government.
The following communication from the
Municipal Reform League has been re
ceived :
To the Citizen* of San FrancUeo: Whenever
Infamous acts of public officials demonstrate
their incompetency or venality the question Is
- askedâ What are you going to do about it?
Recently the Supervisors, sitting as a Board
of Equalization, have reduced the assessment
.â  of the corporations. Spring Valley Water
('omoanv's nx-esament has been reaured by
them from $4,405,534 to $3,405,534. Market
street Railway Comoany'ii assessment from
(9,407,893 to $4,907,305, and other corpora
tions have been iavored in like proportion.
This has been done in the face of tbe fact
that the Spring Valiev Company was granted
by thu eiice board the privilege of chargio*
rates which yield them $1,700,000 per year on I
S?l e ss n t U han|Â£oofow re for OP*"" 1 "* ci enseÃ !
Irr^ ar , aUer >' ca u r in February the Supervisors
nn . I em * uthorit y to tax this City for water
*"ooÂ£?â¢ hIC V iU nel them 6 P er cent on
Â°Â°Â°. and year after yes r the same
oÂ»h^ c " em but *Â» .000.000" t054.000,000.
Other companies which enjoy special privi
wfth . fng the P ubllc streets are treated
whir same outra geous favoritism.
Â« hat are you going to do about ii?
for ;K arag Â«Â° the civic federation was agitating
? forcemenl of the law requiring the
their P^lli companies to put fenders on
imn Â«i" i The reault was that the Supervisors
immediately repealed the law, which imposed
PenaUy>and substituted one which re
r^T.fit. f.^^-railroad companies from any
smft.ll1 7 i lll - lhey (tne Supervisors) selected a
suitable , deviceâ and no suitable device has
rÂ£,nÂ« elected by the Supervisorsâ and the
companies are relieved of all responsibility or
RhÂ£Â£? r . of P rose cution. The same men are
RDout to rant a franchise to the Geary-street
Â£Â£ fi Company years in advance of "the ex
p.ration oi the present franchise.
what are you going to do about it? .
thÂ»^ l i ce L s a day of reckoning is coming, and
men God help the associated villains who. all
over this land, are debauching our institu
tions, as plutocracy has always done in every
nation and In all times. But meantime, while
we are striving for better conditions for. the
real producers of wealth, we can manliest our
1 love for our City and our country by exerting
our influence for the speedy enactment of!
measures which will cure this national
ana municipal disease, and to that
cn d we should work for a charter
which will give the people power to review
and authoritatively decide by vote whether
the acts of their representatives shall stand or
not. In other words the cure for the misrep
resentation of the people by their representa
tives Is the referendum, which is the brief way
of expressing the principle that important
measures shall be submitted, to the people.
Any act which a certain number petition to
be submitted to the electors should be put to
the popular vote.
The people should have the right to dis
cbarge untatisfactory servants. Whenever a
certain number of citizens petition for the
discharge of an official the question should be
submitted to the people. This is what is
called the imperative mandate.
It is exasperating to those who love right
and justice to know that we are now bound by
unyielding systems, which are so framed and
so complicated that we must submit to wrong
because the wrongdoers cannot be reached in
a lawful manner by the people whom they be
tray. And it is still more disheartening to see
those who seem to wish to advance our City's
welfare urging San Franciscans to adopt the
proposed new charter, which has been framed
on the old lines which have proven ineffect
ive. Under the proposed charter the people
would have no redress for acts such as those
aoove referred to.
If the proposed charter is adopted the As
sessor ana Supervisors can engage in the same
kind of nefarious work andâ What are you
going to do about it? will still be the head
lines of the daily papers.
The peace, happiness and safety of the peo
ple depends upon the faithful execution of
their will, ana there is no excuse for any
other condition In a republic. Many, how
ever, realize that unscrupulous men are fash
ioning our laws in their own interest, and that
they are creating conditions which will in
volve us in a serious struggle for existence
and for tae supremacy of the masses. At this
time we urge our lellow-cltizens to thought
fully consider the situation and decide whether
it will be better to secure for San Francisco
a charter which is based upon the principle of
great power in one man's hands or one which is
I founded upon the principle of the true de
mocracy. >*o Instances can be given of good
coming from the carrying out of the one-man
power principle. It is an unwise and danger
ous measure. The proposed new charter is
built upon the principle of concentration of
| power in the Mayor's hands in defiance to all
precedents of the growth of good government
aud freedom.
If it should be adopted amendments would
be very difficult to obtain, because it wouid be
necessary 'â¢
Firstâ To elect a Board of Supervisors favor
able to desired changes.
Secondâ lf .The Mayor disapproved it would
require nine votes of the Supervisors to over
rule him.
. Thirdâ Three-fifths of the electors must vote
in favor of amendments.
Fourthâ All amendments must pass both
houses of the State Legislature. Therefore,
fellow-citizens, do not vote for this charter,
which will leave you still in the power of a
few men. In almost all the cities of the
Nation men are misusing their official posi
tions Decause the people have not the power
to control or remove them, and it would be
just the same uuder the proposed charier.
if it i- defeated another more progressive
charter can be formulated. Let us wait until
we can get a document which will extend our
control over public servants and thus can dis
honesty be stopped. This charter now offered
to you is a very careless revision of the one
you rejected in 1887. ' .

FOR THE NEW CHARTER.
The Merchants' Association Willing to
Enlighten the Labor Council.
The members of the Merchants' Asso
ciation evidently believe that the dale
gates to the San Francisco Labor Council
are not all fully informed upon the new
charter question, or there would not have
been any hesitation in appointing dele
gates to the charter convention. In order
that the council may be more enlightened,
if itde3irc3 to be, the following has been
forwarded :
Son Francisco Labor Council. CityâGentle
men: It appears from the reported proceed
ings of your Labor Council that a division of
opinion exists regarding the new charter; and
definite action, therefore, has been postponed
until your next meeting in the appointment
of two delegates to the charter convention,
called by the Merchants' Association for
August 12.
Sincerely believing that the adoption of the
new charter will prove of decisive advantage
to the wording people of t>an Francisco, and
that none of tbe objections so fur advanced
should sway your council against it, 1 take the
liberty of respectfully suggesting that your
final decision will only be made after a
thorough discussion and consideration of the
exact provisions of the charier.
During the past seven months I have made a
careful and impartial study of this proposed
organic law to ascertain exactly its merits and
demerits, as well as its comparative value
with the present consolidation act and the
more modern municipal governments in the
United States and Europe. The labor involved
in these researches has been for the sole put
pose of arriving at a correct and honest conclu
sion upon the new charter. For this special
work I have neither asked nor received com
pensation from any source, and as no officer,
director or employe of the Merchants' Associa
tion is a candidate for any office in the gift of
the people I expect no reward other than the
consciousness ox having performed the duty of
a citizen.
No problem is fraught with such serious con
sequences to tbe present and Suture genera
tions -of our people as the formation of an
organic law. The workingmen of San Fran
elMO and the Labor Council have often hon
ored me with their confidence, and it would
now be an act of ingratitude on my. part, at
this critical moment, to withhold my humble
services in assisting you to the right decision
upon this fundamental law. Should your
Labor Council therefore desire an address or
debate upon the new charter, under such rules
as you may prescribe, I am at your command.

FRATERNITIES
AVOID DANGER,
Level Assessments Cannot
Longer Sustain Organ
izations.
NEW PLANS INTRODUCED
Grand Recorder Hirshberg of
the A. 0. U. W. Talks of
Classified Assessments.
NEW BOADS TO PERPETUITY
What the Chosen Friends, the Knights
of Honor and the Royal Arcanum
Have Already Done.
Nearly all of the fraternal beneficiary or
ganizations are being met with the start
ling question, Can they exist much longer
under the present system?
More than a quarter of a century ago,
when Bach organizations sprang into ex
istence, it was the idea of the founders
that by the payment of a certain amount
of money in monthly installments, "the
level rate," as it was called, sufficient
could be raised to warrant the individual
association in paying a stated amount to
tbe widow, orphans or near relatives of a
deceased member. It was the impression
that as death carried away members the
vacancies would be filled by new members
and that the number of assessments would
vary but little each year. The expectation
was not realized as to the replenishment
oy new members, and a result was that
there came an increase in the number of
assessments, and finally a rule was adopted
that only a certain amount could be col
lected yearly, and that should be usea for
the payment of death claims. When,
however, there was an excess of deaths in
I the jurisdiction and there was not money
enough collected by the limited as<Â«Â«>Â«s
mants to meet all the claims, the deficit
was made up from the general body of the
order by a general per capita tax, and in
that way all the obligations were met.
This, however, has been found not to be
as successful as was anticipated, and now
the various organizations, as their mem
bers are advancing in ape, are considerine
the beet plans to retain and increase mem
bership, and at the same time make tbe
assessments equitable and not onerous.
One of the great questions that occupied
the attention of the fraternal congress re
cently held was that of graded or classified
assessments, and the almost unanimous
opinion was that ?uch a plan would be
the only means of keeping up the life of
each organization.
The first organization to make a radical
change was the Order of Chosen Friends,
which adopted what is now known as "the
Morse plan," devised by Supreme Coun
cilor Morse of New York City. Whon this
was put into operation in the latter part
of last year many of the members who had
been in the association for many years,
indignant that assessments should be in
creased on account of age. dropped their
membership, and found themselves with
out protection, as they were too old to
join other organizations or were unable to
pass an examination before a medical
examiner. Many of the** are now seek
ing to be reinstated. This order has a
membership of more than 40.000. and since
its foundation in 1879 has disbursed more
than $10,000,000 to beneficiaries.'
The Royal Arcanum at the last Supreme
Council session discussed the matter of
change of assessments and referred the
matter to a committee topresent a plan at
the next session. This has a membership
of 170.000 and haÂ« paid in benefits nearly
$33,000,000. Tbe Knights of Honor .with a
membership of over 121 000. and which has
disbursed more than $52,000,000 since its
organization in 1873. has within a few
weks changed its manner of assessments
and is now working under a graded plan,
and now the Ancient Order of United
I Workmen, one of the oldest and largest
j numerically in the United States, has
fallen into line and has at the recently
held session in Buffalo, N. V., changed the
method of assessment and adopted a new
plan which will shortly be put into opera
tion. This order wa* founded in 1868, has
a membership of 345,000. and it has dis
bursed in death benefits $59,000,000.
David S. Hirshberg. grand recorder, who
was a dek gate from this State to the Su
preme Lodge, in discussing the new plan,
said: "This legislation in regard to assess
ments is tbe most important ever had in
tbe order. The table of rates has already
been published in the fraternal columns
of The Call. The rates are not as some
people believe, graded. In the plan
adopted by the A. O. U. W. the advance is
made every five years up to the age of 55,
when the increase ceases ana the rate re
mains tbe same after that.
"All Grand Lodge separate jurisdictions
that have received relief under the law for
the years 1894 and 1895 and shall receive
relief under that law for 1896, whose maxi
mum is now twenty-four or over, shall
now adopt this plan as a condition prece
dent to relief after the year !Â«!*?.
"An application of the classified rates as
adopted for the jurisdiction of California,
if the Â«ame had been in operation for the
year 1895, would have produced $547.
--738 06, or $17,738 06 more than the liabil
ity incurred for 265 death losse* for that
year. The jurisdiction would have been
in a jiosition to discharge its own obliga
tions and would not have been an appli
cant for relief. Members under 54 years
would hove paid an excess over their lia
bility of $88,918 40, whereas those of 5/> ana
over* would not have discharged the'r obli
gations by $71,180 32, which would have
been paid, however, by the excess pay
ments made by those 54 years old and un
der and would still have left an excess of
$17,738 06.
"The maximum number of assessments
under the classified rate will be twelve;
that is to say one assessment per month,
provided the death losses of tbe jurisdic
tion necessitate that number of assess
ments. If by introduction of new members
in the lower ages and a generally increased
membership the obligations of the juris
diction can be discharged with a less num
ber of assessments than twelve the officers
will not be required to levy assessments
beyond the number required to meet the
obligations. Should there be a deficiency
after the levy of the twelve assessments
such deficiency will be met under an appli
cation of the relief law as at present exist
ing.
"It is to be noticed that under the claÂ«
silied rate sufficient money is provided to
discharge the obligations for each group
of ages, and those below tbe meridian of
age contribute an amount in advance of
their mortuary cost to equalize the cost of
those above the meridian. To prevent
excessive cost to the members in the older
ages who have been in membership for
many years, and as a proper exemplifica
tion of the fraternal element of the insti
tution, these and the younger ages supply
the deficiency, and if any remaining de
ficiency exists, which is unlikely, it is
provided for through the application of
the relief law.
"An application to all the jurisdictions
of the rates referred to has been made by
dividing the members into groups of five
years, and sufficient money is realized in
every case to justify the predictions of the
beneficial commission that alter a long and
careful investigation recommended the
plan adopted.
"The investigations of the commission
left the conclusion that the old plan of the
Ancient Order United Workmen is supe
rior to that of any in use ; but grave doubts
existed as to being able to perpetuate tbe
order under the level rate of assessments.
The perpetuity of the order was the con
trolling motive of tne commission, coupled
with that of placing tbe order on a com
petitive basis. These results have happily
been mathematically and scientifically
worked out."
RIGHTS OF WOMEN.
They Wish for Their Fair Share of Gold
and 6ilverâ Also to Vote.
"The Silver Question" was to nave been
the feature of yesterday's session of the
Pacific Coast Women's Press Association
and William H. Mills was announced to
lead the discussion, but "circumstances
alter cases.' ' Silver was virtually ignored,
in consequence of the failure of Mr. Mills
to appear. The star of the gathering was
Miss Susan B. Anthony and tbe burden of
all the discussion was woman suffrage.
President Mrs. Ada H. Van Pelt was in
the chair, with Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper
seated upon her right and Miss Anthony
upon her left. It was a modern triumvi
rate for the promotion of woman's rights.
After songs by Edwin Thornton, accom
panied on the piano by Miss Mattie Capell.
and Mrs. Eva Wren accompanied by Miss
Mabel Hussey, the president introduced
Miss Antbony.
"All I know concerning silver," she
said, "i 9 that we women do not get our
fair share of it, neither do we of gold.
Consequently, Jwe don't care one iota if
the finances of the countrvbe placed upon
a basis of Â»old or silver. What we wish is a
just share of whatever money is current."
Miss Anthony at this point dropped tne
further consideration of National finances
and ran ou, in her characteristic way, ad
vocating woman suffrage. She said tbat
platforms of all political parties contained
planks recognizing tne rights of women.
It did not, accordingly, matter materially
which one succeeded, but what tne women
should do was to take the stump in the
coming campaign and advocate constitu
tional amendment 11, giving women the
ballot.
Miss Mabel Ilussey reciwd, in effective
style, a tale from Browning, and was suc
ceeded by Miss Ida Harper, Colonel P. T.
Dickinson and Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper in
brief addresses upon the social and politi-.
cal rights of women.
Benefit to Charles B. Cook.
A long bill of attractions has been prepared
for the testimonial performance to Charles E.
Cook which will take place in the Macdonough
Theater next Tuesday evening. Among those
who will appear will be Tyudall, the mind
reader and hypnotist ; Swiunerton ; Miss Mar
caret Craven ana Mr. Francis Powers in the
balcony scene from ' -Romeo and Juliet"; Miss
Freda Galllck and Mr. Louis Butler In "The

soprano ; Martin Pache in operatic selections;
Frank Doane and Amy Lee in their funny spe
cialties; Richard Karl in operatic selections,
and also others. A feature of the benent will
be a prize cake-walk, one of the prizes for
which is announced to be a mammoth prize
cake. Talent for the cake-walk can enter free.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with -he wind. The top flgnres
a station indicate rnnxinium temperature for the
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted si:ow in inches and hundredth*,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiKh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accomuanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" nsi ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
anu low alone the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
wenther may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition!
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK, N. V., July 27.â The seenrity mar
kets to-day.were quiet. Sales were smaller than
for a Ion; time past, the dealings only aggregating
117.000 shares. At the opening there was a great
pressure to sell, the action of the Pooulists at St.
Louis last Saturday having created a bearish sen
timent both here and in London. .Foreign opera
tors sold from 10.U00 to 12,000 shares of St. Paul
and Louisville and Nashville and local traders put
out smaller lines of srocks. Under this process
â¢he list yielded anywhere from 14 to 214 per cent;
Jersey Central, sugar, the grangers, Louisville and
Nashville and Manhattan scoring the heaviest
losses.
Later on a rally ensued with the announcement
that the committee on foreign bankers had com
pleted their plan for the prevention of gold exports.
While no details were obtainable from official
mures, It Is learned that the plan provides for the
formation of a powerful syndicate to control the
exchange market anil the co-operation of local as
well as London, Berlin and Paris bankers. So far
as the ability of the syndicate to carry out the
scheme is concerned it may be said that the belief
is that the bankers will control the situation with
out a shadow of doubt until election.
in the afternoon rally Sugar and Gas were most
prominent. Near the close the market showed a
tendency to run off. In the final transactions
speculation was - barely steady in tone. . Net

CHICAGO MAKKETS.
CHICAGO, Ir*., July Wheat experienced
rather . unsettled action for a . short while this
morning, but subsequently displayed weakness,
prices declining materially from the high figures
established at the ; opening. . First prices were
about %c higher than the final ones of Saturday,
rains acd predictions of showers In winter wheat
sections apparently carrying weight as a bull ar
gument. Professionals were willing and anxious
to sell at the advance, however, and the enhance
ment very quickly [ disappeared under the pres
sure of offerings. The world's shipments for last
week aggregated 5,8 69.0U0 bushels. The amount
on ocean passage decreased 1,200,000 bushels.
Receipts at Chicago were 124 cars, and the North
west held 414 cars against 179 last Monday, and
246 a year aso. Local inspections from store
amounted to 139.300 bushels. Liverpool cables
were steady, closing lower. The American visible
supply increased 390.000 bushels, and English
253,000 bushels. Clos ng Continental quotations
were . generally higher. Export clearances
amounted to 236.827 bushels. Tlioman issued a
very bullish report, which had a slight temporary
Influence for firmness. September wheat opened
from 60@59%c, declined to 6?%c cosed at 69%
(a&9Sgc, a shade under Saturday. Estimated re
ceipts tor to-morrow 200 cars.
CORNâ Began well under the guidance of im
provement noted In wheat early, but it was soon
evident that it lacked stability. Good crop reports,
heavy receipts and lower Liverpool cables com
bined to dishearten holders. Prices succumbed to
the selling, which was by far of greater importance
than the buying. The amount on ocean passage
Increased 1,140,000 bushels. Withdrawals from
store amounted to 208,094 bushels. The visible
supply increased 144, 000 bushels. Export clear
ances amounted to 148,910 oushels. . Thoman's
report was bearish. September corn opened at
27% c. sold between 26c and 25^t@26%c, closing
at zs%c. from 3/B&V2C under Saturday. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow 108 cars.
OATSâ Were in tone quite the reverse of corn i
and wheat. The sentiment was firm and smaller
receipts than looked for, 164 cars, helped the feel
ing. withdrawals from store amounted toy 13. 719
busneis. Export clearances amounted to 319,263
bushels. Thoman reported a deterioration in the
oats crop. September oats Closed higher than on 1
Saturday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow 240
cars.
FLAXâ Firm; cash, 74c: September. 74%@
76% c: December. 75%. Receipts were 60 cars.
PROVISIONSâ Though opening steady the pro
vision market was possessed of no qualifications of
strength. A few minutes after â  the start every
commodity traded In under the head of product
lost something in value. The hog situation and
the low consumptive demand exercised an adverse
Influence on th â  market. September pqrk closed
10c lower, September lard and ribs each 7 V 2 @loc
lower.
BUTTERâ The situation in the butter market
was unchanged. Fine makes in good demand.
Other grades were in good supply.

THE STOCK MARKET
Stocks opened steady yesterday and prices ad
vanced on the noon Informal session, Choltar sell-
Ing up to $2 20, but the feeling was weaker again
on the afternoon call, as will be seen by the sales.
The chief cause of Chollar's advance was the ap
pearance of about a foot of quartz In the face of
the south drift on the 300 level of the Brunswick
workings. When the assays were made, however,
it wsa found that the grade was low.
Additional reports from the Comstock are as fol
lows:

streak of ore in the north drift continues the same
in size and value as last reported. _ Have started to
cut out for an praise on this streak. ' 975 level-

LOSES HIS LIFE,
He Was Found Unconscious
in a Room Filled With
Gas.
SAID TO BE SUICIDE.
Is a Leading Contractor and
President of the Build
ers' Exchange.
COULD NOT GZT MONEY IN.
His Wife Says He Was Deeply Dis-
tressed When He Left Home
Last Night
Oakland OyncE San Fraxcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 27. \
President William Winnie of the Build
ers' Exchange was found almost dead this
President William Winnie of the Oakland Builders' Exchange, Who Was
Found Nearly Dead Yesterday in a Room Full of Gas.
morning, under circumstances that leave
ro doubt in the minds of the attendant
physicians that he attempted to commit
suicide.
â  He was found in a small room on the
second story of the Exchange building at
8 o'clock this morning. He was uncon
scious, the room wa3 filled with gas, anfl
from a tube connected with the burner gas
was escaping at full pressure. Secretary
White made the discovery as he was look
ing for Mr. Winnie, whose absence from
home last night was reported at the Ex
change early this morning.
The unconscious man was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, and the combined ef
orts of Drs. J. J. Medras and Kitchings
fwere rewarded by a return of respiration,
although the patient was unconscious
throughout the day.
No one appears to know when Mr.
Winnie went to the little room. He left
his wife after-dinner last night saying he
was going for a short walk. He did not
return home all night, and this morning
Mr?. Winnie sent out inquiries to Secre
tary White.
When Mr. Winnie was found he was sit
ting in a chair with his head on his breast. I
His features were almost blue, and death |
was not far off. Dr. Kitchings says that
â¢it is his opini n that Mr. Winnie took the
tube in his mouth and that it fell out when
he became unconscious. He has no doubt
that it is a case of attempted suicide.
Mrs. Winnie, after waiting several hours
for her husband's return to consciousness,
went to the hospital this afternoon. She
said that her husband had been despondent
by reason of business being so dull. When
he left the house last ni^rht he was greatly
depressed, and Mrs. Winnie feared the
wofst. He also referred to money which
he had loaned and could not collect. His
wife mentioned his reference to a note of
W. B. Hardy that was not secured, and
which was in his liabilities when he failed.
There are some doubts in the minds of
Winnie's friends as to the suicide theory.
They aay that if he intended to commit
Miicidc he would have locked himself in,
a precaution which he omitted. Besides,
there is no reason known to them why he
should seen death. He has always met
his obligations, and although Dusiness is
somewhat dull, he was getting his share.
Mr. Winnie iÂ« now acting for the third
year as president of the Builders'
Exchange. He is reported to be out of
danger to-night, but as he is GO years of
age, there may be a relapse.
PRINTING THE REGISTER.
Supervisor Will Inspect the Contra
Costa Road on Wednesday.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 27.â At the meet
ing of the Board of Supervisors this morn
iug the matter of the Contra Costa road
was considered. The road is known as
No. 2859, and is an extension of Thirteenth
avenue. Several farmers appeared and
asked the speedy consideration of the
matter in order that they might market
their crops in Oakland. They stated that
the Supervisors of Contra Costa County
were ready to act in the matter as soon as
Alameda County acted.
Supervisor Talcott favored a visit over
the proposed road, so the board decided to
go out as a committee of the whole and

MILK ORDINANCE PASSED.
The Board of Health Follows San
Francisco's Example.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 27.â The new
ordinance reeulatine the sale of milk and
tbe health of consumers was read the first
time to-night, and on the urgent request
of Dr. Buckland tiie rules were suspended
and it was read a second time.
The ordinance is very stringent and is
modeled very closely after the ordinance
now in force in San Francisco. Dr. Buck
land said that it was a known fact that
milk was being brought into Oakland that
wns the product of unhealthy cows, and
he considered that even a day's delay was
a calamity.
Councilman Towle said that the dairy
interests represented laTge investments,
and he thought it hardly fair to ruÂ»h
through a stringent ordinace without giv
ing the dairymen a chance to be heard and
to suggest any amendments. He did not
suppose they were knowingly kee ping sick
cows and brihgine impure milk to market,
and although he admitted the urgency of
the measure he thought those most inter
ested haa a right to be heard and to make
any suggestions they thought proper.
The ordinance was passed a second time,
but the clerk was instructed to withhold it
from printing till after the Ordinance and
Judiciary Committee had met and bad
heard the dairymen in tbe matter.
The Auditor's Levy.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 27.â Cit7 Auditor
Snow has prepared his estimate of the ex
penses and the necessary levy for the fiical
i year 1896-97- He considers that a tax levy of
$1 12 will be necessary to run the city gov
ernment and meet the accruing bond in
terest and redemption. The past yÂ«ar has
been run on $1 and the Mayor will un
doubtedly veto any levy that calls for a
larger amount.
LOVERS ONLY IN NAME.
The Loves Threaten Divorce and
Shooting and Visit the
Police.
Only Harried Three Months, But Al
ready Wish They Had
Never Met.
Oakland Office Saw Frakcipco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 27. )
Dr. Love visited the office of Mrs. Pres
cott Â«f the Children's Society to-night to
I see if he coald get authority to take his
! wife from the house of Mrs. Burwell, on
Franklin street, where she is now living.
He also called several times on the Chief
of Police for the same purpose, but ob
tained no satisfaction. Love said to-night
I that his wife's affections had been alien
ated from him by the Burwells and he
I would have justice.
Mrs. Love when seen told a very differ
ent story. She is a pretty little blonde,
and she declares that Love is persecuting
her to ruin her and keep her from getting
a divorce. She has procured an attorney,
and a complaint will be filed in which she
charges him with attempting to force her
I to lead a life of shame for his oenefit. She
[ declared to-night that he had attempted
to place her in a house of ill-fame for his
own benefit. She says she is not afraid of
him, and does not think he is at all dan
gerous. Sbe declared that every word he
spoke was a lie, and defied him to prove a
word of it.
They met at the Burwell residence to
night and invited a Call man to hear
their stories. Love called biÃ wife all
j Kinds of pet and endearing names, but she
i would have nothing to do with him. He
I then became abusive, when Mr. Burwell
i forced him to leave the house. Mrs. Love
I Bald she would Btay where she was until
she could get something to do or some
place to live.
Love is around town to-night, vowing
he will get satisfaction before midnight or
else go and shoot bis wife and the Bur
wells. Mrs. Love merely laughed when
told of her husband's threats, and said his
tongue was his most dangerous weaoon.
The couple were married about three
months atro, and their short married life
has been one of constant warfare.
Chief Lloyd said to-night that he bad
investigated the citse and had concluded
it was a case for the civil courts.
A New Device.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 27.â A new de

Another WorthleiÃ Franchise.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 27.â The City
Council met to-night as a Board of Equali
zation. A communication was received
from the Contra Costa Water Company
asKing t:>at the assessment on its fran
chise be reduced from $150,U00 to nothing,
as it is of no value. The Supervisors re
duced it to $10, as it was held to be tax
able in San Francisco, and the same argu
ment is made in regard to .the city. The
board decided to postpone all action till
next Monday night.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JULY 28, 1896.
FRESHMEN IN
A QUANDARY
They Don't Know What
to Call Their
Class.
PROBABLY TKE CENTURY
"00" Will Result if Prece
dent Is Followed
Out.
THE QUESTION MUCH DEBATED
Serious Difficulty in Finding a Suit*
able Contraction of "1900"
Men.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 27.â "What are
we going to call our class?" said one pros
pective freshman at the State University
to another to-day as they sauntered across
the campus toward the library. "I don't
know," said the other embryo college
man, "unless we name it the 'century
! class.' " "That's what we will have to do,
! I guess," replied his friend as they en
j tered the door of the university book
I repository, "but what will the next class
call itself â the one that graduates in
1901?"
The problem as to what name the 1900
men will finally christen their class and
how they will incorporate it into their
slogan of war without causing too decided
a ruffling of their thoracic organs has been
the subject of discussion for probably
every "fresnie" who has pitched his tent
in the classic precincts of Berkeley this
season.
Though but comparatively few of them
have as yet come to Berkeley, because the
university does not open for slightly over
a fortnight, yet enough have set up their
standards on the college reservation to
give a lively "rushing" exhibition, if such
a practice were opportune.
The difficulty in naming their class as to
j the year number is not by any means con
fined to the Berkeley freshmen, but will be j
a subject for debatÃ in every university in j
the land where four-year courses are given, j
It has been customary among college
men for decades and decades to abbreviate <
their class year number as much as pos- i
sible, and in so doing the first two figures,
indicating the century in which they lived, ,
have been eliminated, leaving only the i
last two figures, such as " '96" or " '99."
Through application of this process, es- ;
tablished by precedent, the only conclu
sion that can be reached and the only
name that can be given to the class of ,
1900, according to this rule, is "00." "But
such a conclusion will never do," say the
freshmen, for then the two ciphers would
have to be named, and about the only
short term that conld be applied to them
; is, "Naughty naught," "Nothing" or
"Nit."
But to be thrown under the ban of ridi
cule and made the subjects of jests, simply
for the purpose of following a precedent, is
more than many of the freshies can bear,
and so such of them as have reached the
i college town seem to think that the "Cen
tury" class will be their name, if they
name it at all.
In conversation one of the brightest of

consumption, after an illness of several
years. He took pneumonia several years
ago and never fully recovered from the
effects, which left bis lungs in a weakened
condition.
He moved his family to Oakland four
years ago. but had to return owing to his
business interests, which were all in
Fresno and required a great deal of his
attention. Owing to the extreme heat he
came to Oakland 1 again, but not in time to
benefit his health.
He leaves a widow and grown family.

THE PASSING OF A CITY
Trestle Glen Campers Depart for
All Sections of the
State.
An Ancient Vehicle Which Brought
a Hallelujah Crowd Up
From Hollister.
Oaklawd Office San Frascisoo Call,)
908 Broadway, July 27. )
The big city of tents was wrecked in an
hour this morning and by noon, its deni
zens were en route to all parts of the State.
The camp-meeting is looked upon as a
two week's holiday of the Salvation Army
and when it closes they all depart re
freshed ready to make new conquests in
their various fields.
One of the earliest risers this morning
was Brigadier Keppel and the demolition
of his canvas headquarters was the signal
for the exodus from the glen. Tents in all
directions were quickly leveled and a little
later were packed on wagons with all the
other utensils that go to make up a camp
and finally the campers got on top and the
caravansaries drove off.
It was a picturesque procession that
drove along the dusty road leading from
tne glen. One of the most notable vehi
cles was an old stagecoach that had rat
tled many miles in San Benito County. It
was an interesting thing, and its irregular
wheels, and its sides with cracked paint,
and its long awning that reached out far
ahead of the horses' tails, and its cracked
windows and its guard-deck in the stern
all looked like fragments of a chapter of
the ptfst. Certainly no such coach has
been built for forty years. It bad a banner
tacked on its side that read: "8. â A. con
tingent, Trestle Glen to Hollister." The
banner had done duty before, but it had
been cut and the words "Hollister" and
"Trestle Glen" had changed placos.
All kinds of wagons and all kinds of
people were in the procession. The equip
ages looked dusty and the riders looked
weary and as if they were glad to be
headed homeward once more.
The camp-meeting has Deen a great suc
cess, according to the statements of those
in charge. Nearly 400 people have been
at the penitent form, and the financial end
has not been neglected. Brigadier Keppel
explained that a camp-meeting is a very
expensive thing for the various corps that
attend. The officers are without the usual
offerings at their barracks for two weeKs
and they have no other source of income,
so the camp-meeting is depended upon for
the deficiency in rent and the means of
support. The only event that marred the
daily routine was the accident to the elec
tric road yesterday, which delayed all
travel for about three hours.
This evening all the Salvationists' tents
are gone and the glen is deserted. The
big pavilion will resound for the rest of
the year with the mirth and laughter of
midnight revelry and the sign on the salon
door, "Closed during the Salvation Army
camp-m eting," has been laid away till
next year.

EDWARD BARNETT
IS EDWARD BAER.
The Weil-Known Warrant
Broker Startles a
Deputy.
SWEARS TO TWO NAMES.
Some Doubt as to Which Name
Should Be on the Reg

COUNTY CLEBK IN DOUBT.
Baer Explains How He Came to Bs
Known as Edward Bar*
nett.
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 27. [
Edward Barnett, the warrant-broker, is
not Edward Barnett at all. He is Edward
Baer; but his right name is known only
to himself and a deputy county clerk.
Everybody who does city and county
official business in Oakland knows Edward
Barnett. He is known to every municipal
employe, as well as to heads of depart
ments. Occasionally he has done business
with Mayors, but one and all have thought
the broker's name was Barnett.
Saturday afternoon E. Barnett was at
the County Clerk's office swearing to some
claims, which is about the only business
he transacts in that office. A deputy
asked him to register. Barnett replied
that he bad registered already. The clerk
searched the affidavits, but found none
sworn to by Edward Barnett, and he so
informed him.
Barnett then said he had registered as
Edward Baer, and such proved to be the
case.
When the matter was called to the atten
tion of County Clerk Jordan he said that
he would hare to submit the matter to
the District Attorney, as he was not sure
whether he (Jordan) was justified in allow
ing his name to remain on the great reg
ister.
"Barnett is in a peculiar position," said
Mr. Jordan to-day. "He has been in this
office scores of times and has sworn that
his name is Edward Barnett. He has
served on juries and sworn that his name
is Edward Barnett, and that is the name
by which everybody in Oakland knows
him. Now he comes into the office and
registers and swears that his name is Ed
ward Baer. When he goes to a voting
booth I would not blame any officer for re
fusing to allow him to vote as Baer. The
matter is a very peculiar one, for it is evi
dent that no man can legally possess two
names at once and transact business with
both."
Edward Barnett says that he is not
aware that he has done anything illegal.
"My real name is Baer,'' he said this afur
noon, "and I have that Dame on my pass
port from Germany and on my citizenship
papers, and I always register by that
name, so that if Igo back to Europe I
should have no trouble. Many years ago
my father found that there was so much
difficulty in getting his name spelt right
that he decided to change it. He had a
brother who had changed to Barnett, and
so be took the same name. Then I took
it, and have done business under that
name. I hope I have not caused myself
or anybody else any trouble by having two
names."
OFFERS EIGHT THOUSAND.
The First Congregational Church
Wants Rev. Dr. Stimpson
for Its Pastor.
He Is a Prominent New York Preacher,
bat His Acceptance Is a Matter
of Doubt.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 27. j
Much surprise was manifested to-day in
church circles when it became known that
the First Congregational church was mak
ing a desperate effort to obtain Rev. Dr.
Stimpson of New York as their pastor. It
is stated that negotiations have been go
ing on for some weeks, but that Dr. Stimp
son is not particularly anxious to come to
this city. All manner of inducements
have been offered, and the committee has
offered as an additional Inducement to
raise tne salary from $6000 to $8000.
The First Church has been without a
pastor for over a year. Since Rev. Dr. Mc-
Lean resigned to accept the presidency of
the Pacific Theological Seminary the
church has been trying to obtain a perma
nent pastor. Several have been negotiated
with, but all have refused to accept. A
few months ago Rev. C. E. Jefferson was
sent a check to come from Chelsea, Mass.,
and preach a couple of weeks. He was
very acceptable, but after getting home
again he concluded that he was better off
where he now is.
Rev. John Halleck, a preacher of note,
who resigned his pastorate in Tacoma
somewhat suddenly a few months ago
and who has since been in Oakland, was
thought to be a candidate for Dr. McLean's
place, but he has not been approached,
and now the news is given out that Dr.
Stimpsou of New York is the man who
would be acceptable to the big and wealthy
congregation.
Dr. Stimpson is at present pastor of a
large church and it is very uncertain
whether he can be prevailed upon to come
out West. The committee muse to dis
cuss their plans, but admit that they are
still looking for a suitable man.
For More Improvements.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 27.â Tuesday
night the West Oakland Improvement
Club will hold a meeting, at which much
business of importance will be brought
up. The executive committee met Satur
day night and discussed several proposi
tions which will be taken up at this meet
ing.
The opening of Wood street will be con
sidered, and it is now expected that the
club will push the contemplated improve
ment through to completion. The matter
of the location of the proposed park will
be settled, if possible, at this meeting.
This will be no easy task, for the members
are somewhat divided upon this subject
themselves. Some want to have it located
near the Sixteenth-street station, while
the others want it between Peralta and
Adeline streets.

CHIEF ROGERS INDIGNANT
He Says Dr. Bovard Does Net
Know What He Is Talking
About.
Useless for Him to Crowd the Courts
With Arrests Until the Present
Cases Are Disposed Of.
ALAMEDA, Cal.. July 27.â City Mar
shal Rogers feels hurt at the reflections
cast upon the police force of Alameda and
le habits of its citizens. In speaking of
the sermon delivered last night by Dr. Bo-
Yard, he said:
"I think Dr. Bovard doesn't know what
he is talking about, but some one evi
dently is prodding him on in this matter,
and it should be stopped, for the good of
the city. He says I think it is' his duty to
run down and arrest evildoers. I don't
think anything of the kind, because I
don't think he is competent to do so. But
I have said that if he knows that gambling
is going on, it is his duty as a good citizen
to make complaint on wnich the authori
ties can act. I do not know that gam
bling, as he says, is conducted in this city,
and I say that'it is not true that it is.
"I notice also he says that a police
forre that hangs about saloons swearing
and drinking is a breeder, not a sup
pressor, of vice. Now that's a remark en
tirely uncalled for. Where would you ex
pect a policeman to be in search of crimi
nal or evil-minded persons? Would he
have us in his church? I say there is no
city in California where the police do less
hanging about saloons than in Alameda,
and there's no city better conducted or
with less need of police.
"The people who play draw poker ia this
city are very well known. There are
about twenty of them. There are two
cases pending before the Eecorder, ana of
what use would it be for me to crowd the
court with more arrests for playing draw
poker until these cases are settled? There
is a question whether or not the City
Trustees can pass an ordinance making
poker playing a crime, when the State law
does not name it as one of the prohibited
games. lam willing that strange officers
shall come to Alameda and see whether
there is any eambling here or any better
behaved or quieter town. !>
The cases Chief Marshal Rogers speaks
of were instituted by the City Attorney
against Joseph Enieric and Powell Bros,
in the month of April. On April 29 the
case of Emenc was gone into before the
City Recorder, and judgment was reserved.
The case against Powell was reserved until
that of Emeric was disposed of. Since
then Powell Bros, have sold their business.
Another Judgment for the City.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 27.â 1n the be
ginning of May, F. N. Delanoy proceeded
to erect poles on the city's streets. He
kept on with the work until June 1,
when the Street Superintendent with a
force of men started in to pull them out
and confiscate them. An injunction was
at once issued restraining Superintendent
Frodden from interfering with the poles,
and Delanoy stopped putting any more
up. To-day" Judge Ogden sustained the
city's demurrer to Delanoy's complaint,
and gave him five days to make answer
and amend the same.
Parlor Suffrage Meeting.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 27.â Woman
suffrage parlor meetings are becoming
very popular. A most successful one was
held at the residence of Mrs. Fiala, 1719
Santa Clara avenue, on Saturday evening,
at which addresses were delivered by
Colonel T. P. Dickenson, Green Majors
and Rev. G. R. Dodson. Miss Morris,
Mrs. Fletcher and Dr. Fletcher contributed
a choice selection of musical numbers.
Severed an Artery.
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 27. â Captain
James W. Dumbrell. a pressman by voca
tion, living at 412 Larkin street, San Fran
cisco, came across the bay yesterday to
spend the day with his relatives. In the
morning he went for a bicycle ride that
nearly co^t him his life. He hired a bicy
cle, and having enued his ride rode up the
runway from the street across the side
walk to the entrance of the cyclery before
dismounting. He did not alight quickly
enough, and t!:e wheel slipped from him,
pitching him headlong through the giass
of the show window.
He was wedged in so tightly that the
pane had to be broken to draw hie head
out. Thai, it was found he was bleeding
severely from cuts on his face and neck.
One gash on the neck severed an artery
that required immediate attention. Frank
St. Sure, a medical student at Cooper's
College, was fortunately at hand, and
stancned the hemorrhage until a doctor
could be obtained.
The patient was taken to the home of his
mother-in-law, Mrs. M. J. McKenny, 1613
Benton street, and later on in the day had
recovered sufficiently to return home.
City Trustees. *
ALAMEDA, Cal., July 27.â The Board
of Trustees held its usual meeting this
evening. The electrician's report lor the
months of May and June showed receipts
from private consumers, $524 55; value of
light supplied to public buildings and
streets, $1651 85; disbursements, $1865 37.
Bills, including salaries for current
month, amounting to $3577 77, were or
dered paid.
The board will meet as a Board of Equal
ization on the second Monday in August
and ordered a notice of that fact inserted
in the city official paper. The Odd Fel
lows' Hall Association was granted per
mission to alter their building and build
a banquet* room in the attic story.
The City Cierk presented his annual re
port, suggesting among other things that
the bookkeeping in city offices be better
systemized. ' On recommendation of the
Clerk the Kings-avenue opening fund was
closed by transfer of 7 cents to the general
fund and a similar action was taken with
regard to the 28 cents in the Buena Vista
avenue opening fund.

Fishes That Yawn.
It is not generally known that fish yawn.
The writer saw a turbot yawn twice and a
cod once, the latter being one of tbe widest
yawns accomplished by any animal of its
size. The yawn of a'turbot, being some
thing not commonly seen, deserves more
particular description. A turbot's mouth
is twisted on one side, rather as if it had
belonged to a round fish which some one
had accidentally trodden on and squashed
half flat The yawn begins at tne lips,
which open as if to suck in water. Then
the jaws become distended and it is seen
that this is going to be a real, genuine sub
marine fish's yawn. But the yawn goes
on, works through the back of the head,
distending the plates of the skull, and
comes out at the gills, which open, show
the red inside, are inflated for a moment
and then, with a kind of stretching shiver
of the back, the fish flattens out again un
til, if unusually bored, it relieves itself by
another yawn. â London Spectator.
NO RESPECT FOR OLD AGE.
Special 0 fleer Munson Knocks
Down a Half-Invalid
Named Martin.
The Old Man Breaks a Chair Over the
Officer's Head on a Street
Corner.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, )
908 Broadway, July 27. J
The sight of a young man striking a
gray-haired old man a- stinging blow in
the mouth and the old gentleman belabor
ing the young man over the head with a
chair was what met the eyes to-night of
passengers as the streetcars turned "Cre
go's corner" in East Oakland.
It was the result of an old family feud
wherein Mr. Munson and a Mr. Martin
had quarreled about a sidewalk and steps.
To-night Mr. Martin's son, who is a spe
cial police officer, met Martin at Crego'a
corner, where a crowd congregate every
night. The old quarrel was taken up by
the son and Munson. Words grew hot
and the bystanders advised peace. Fi
nally the police officer landed a blow as
quick as a flush on the old man's mouth,
cutting a gash in the upper lip.
The old man was equally as qnick and
struck Martin over the head a stinging
blow, knocking all of the rounds out of
the chair. Blows fell thick and fast, with
honors about even, but Martin backed off
a step or two and down into the street,
when Munson struck the old man a blow
that floored him. By this time bystanders
interfered and parted the couple. Martin
was helped up and stood half dazed, while
Munson went back home to clean up.
Mr. Martin is a harmless old man, who
does a great deal of talking. He is affected
with heart disease, and some of his friends
claim that he may drop dead from the ex
citement. He seldom leaves home without
company, as he is always seriously affected
by excitement.
SEEKING FOR A TERMINUS
President Asano of the Proposed
Steamship Line to This Coun
try Due To-Day.
Will Meet With a Cordial Recept on
by Those Mcst Interested in the
Port's Commerce.
President Socharino Asano of the Tovo
Risen Kaisha, the Japanese steamship
company which is seeking for a terminus
on this coast for its proposed line of steam
ships from Yokohama, will arrive in this
City to-day from Seattle.
Arrangements have already been mad*
by Traffic Manager W. 3. Curtis of tbe
California Traffic Association for an inter
view with the chief officer of this enter
prising Japanese company for the pur
pose of bringing to his notice in a lorcible
and favorable light the advantages of this
port as a terminus for the Toyo Risen
Raisha line of vessels.
One of the chief obstacles in tbe way of
a new trans- Pacific line of steamers coming
to San Francisco is the peculiar combina
tion of interests that exist between the
Southern Pacific Company and the Pacific
Mail ana Occidental and Oriental steam
ship companies. It has been stated on
the most reliable authority that the
Southern Pacific Company, through its
partiality for the two steamship compa
nies mentioned, prevented one steamship
line from coming to San Francisco by de
clining to make desirable concessions to it.
With a knowledge of these facts the first
step will be to arrange a conference with
the traffic officials of the railroad com
pany at which President Asano will be
present and also Traffic Manager Curtis.
The latter gentleman fully realizes the im
portance of this movemfent and is giving a
large portion of l<is time and energy to
bringing about its successful culmination.
"I think I have enough facts and argu
ments to present to President Asano,'' said
I Mr. Curtis yesterday, "to convince him
that San Francisco is'the terminus for his
line. I don't believe for a moment that
these outside points can offer the facilities
that we can, nor the business."
On behall of the Japanese Government
Sho Kemoto is investigating along the
same lines as President Asano and in con
nection with the latter's nroposed line,
but while Nemoto's report will be simply
a recommendation the final decision will
rest with the company itself. It is for
this line that San Diego is now making
such great efforts. Seattle. Portland and
Tacoma are also competitors in this mat
ter.
Should the conference with the South
ern Pacific Company result satisfactorily
President Asano will be asked to meet the
members of the Chamber of Commerce,
the San Francisco Board of Trade and the
Traffic Association, when he will learn
more fully what be has to expect in the
way of support from the local merchants.

SAUSALITO WILL
HAVE A "NIGHT."
Marin County Proposes to
Hold a Glorious Car
nival.
IT IS TO BE UNIQUE.
Â«
The Idea Originated With Com
modore Bruce and Editor
J. H. Pryor.
MASS-MEETING ON THURSDAY.
Red Fires Will Gleam From the Peaks.
The Bay Will B- Ablaze With
Light.
"A Night in Bausalito" will be a night
when the pretty Marin hill town will be
a blaze of light from peak to bay. Among
the trees electric lamps and colored fires
will glow, and out on the water hundreds
of tugs, yachts and small boats will dart
to and fro amid the most splendid illu
mination.
The idea originated with Commodore
C. C. Bruce of the San Francisco Yacht
Club and Editor J. ri. Pryor of the Sausa
lito. News. Commodore Bruce is one of
the Town Trustees and Mr. Pryor is Town
Clerk, consequently the plan of "A Night
in Sausalito" has official backing.
"We will not know definitely what fea
tures we will have," said Editor Pryor
yesterday, "until we have our mass-meet
ing next Thursday evening; but we will
have an affair thatf will be unrivaled in
completeness and splendor. Altboueh the
thing is yet in its incipiency the citizens
of Sausalito are moving individually in
the matter. Already a pood sum of money
is piedged without a single canvasser hav
ing been sent out.
"There will be no literary programme or
any form of entertainment other than the
grand illumination that will blaze out all
over the place. As the only expense will
be the usual ferry fare we expect that
thousands of people will cross the bay to
attend the 'night.' The North Pacific
Coast Railroad Company will be well rep
resented on the committees and conse
quently arrangements will be made re-
carding good and safe transportation.
"Tne carnival will take place near the
first of September on a night when there
is no fog or wind, if possible.
"Even at this early date we have chosen
a few features which may be mentioned.
On the lofty point of rocks above the
town a mammoth red-fire will be kept
burning all evening. Five or six hundred
pounds of the brilliant inflammable com
pound will be conveyed to the peak and
the flame will be seen from every point on
San Francisco Bay. To-morrow our town
electric system will be inaugurated and
we have made arrangements to have extra
wires and lamps run all over the bill. We
will also have strung calcium lights at
different points. An electric lighting com
pany from the City will assist us in this.
"There are about a dozen large ships
moored here, and they will be bronht
down ana anchored off the town. Lanterns,
lamps and colored lights trill gleam from
their lofty yards and mastheads, making
a noble, a grand water display. All of the
yacht clubs will participate and their
pretty illuminations will complete the
glorious display.
Â° "There will be a marine parade in which
every floating craft will take part. If there
are any war vessels at hand they will be
present, and their officers and crews in
vited to become a feature of the affair.
"Several bands of music will be stationed
at different points on the hill and bay.
Thousands of Japanese lanterns will be
lighted and swung from the trees and
from every conceivable place over the
town.
" 'A Night in Sausalito' will rival day in
the splendor of illumination. A queen of
the 'nicht' will be elected by popular vote."
A mass-meeting will be held at the
Town Hall Thursday evening, to which
everybody on eacn side of the bay is in
vited. Then full arrangements will be
made and the actual work of the coming
carnival begun.
Smallest Mayor in the World.
A veritable Ohio party sat in the lobby
oi the Raleigh last evening, when fully
half a dozen Buckeyes joined each other
by chance. One of them was Major George
Anderson of Springfield, says the Wash
ington Times.
"Our city will probably next spring en
joy the distinction of having the smallest
Mayor in tbe world," said he. "All that
is lacking is his election, for he has an
nounced himself as a candidate. His
name is Colonel Joseph Leffel. His popu
larity is very great.
"He is one of the most noted personages
in the work) and is even smaller than Gen
eral Tom Thumb. Repeated fabulous
offers have been made to him to travel for
exhibition purposes, but he has always
declined and turned nis attention to rais
ing fancy poultry and pet dogs, from
which he made quite a fortune.
"Colonel Leffei was born in 1833. It is
Baid his father was 6 feet 1 inch high
in his stocking feet, and tnat bis mother
weighed 200 pounds. He married a little
Jady scarcely larger ttian himself, and
they have four pretty children, all of nor
mal size. The candidate once was a mem
ber of the City Council."â Pittsbure Dis
patch.

With Official Corrup
tion.
LOWERED ASSESSMENTS.
Accused of Conspiring to Favor
Corporations and Defraud
the City.
A PETITION FOR REMOVAL.
Defendants Are King, Scully, B nja
min, Hughes, Dunker, Morgen
stern and Wagner.
The Grand Jury met at 2 o'clock yester
day afternoon. Of the nineteen members,
only two â Alpheus Bull Jr. and A. F.
Price â were absent. At 4 o'clock the jury
went into Judge Daingerfield's court and
the following members responded to the
rpllcall: Frank Ma-key (foreman), P.
McLennan (secretary), P. F. Butler, E. E.
THE SEVEN SUPERVISORS WHO HAVE BEEN PRESENTED BY THE GRAND JURY.
Chever, John F. Cline, Louis Feldmann,
C. L. Haskell, H. H. Hencke, John
Landers. C. S. Laumeister, Edward Mal
ley. Jacob Martenstein. P. McG. McÃean,
C. O'Connor, J. J. O'Farrell, T. F. Payue
and G. H. Unibsen.
Replying to Judge Daingerfield, who
asked tne foreman if the jury had any re
port to make, Mr. Maskey said:
"We have an accusation in writing
which we wish to present to the District
Attorney."
District Attorney Barnes, then address
ing the court, saitl tl.it he desired it en
tered on the records oi the court that six
teen members uf the Grand Jury, through
the foreman, in open court, had petitioned
the District Attorney, and the District
Attorney had received the petition, to
present an accusation against seven Super
visors.
The record was made as requested by
the District Attorney.
The presentments are against Supervi
sors Joseph King, Peter Scully, C. E. Ben
jamin, E. C. Hughes. Chris Dunker, A. W.
Morgenstern and Edward L. Wagner, and
accuses each and all of them of willful
and corrupt misconduct in reducing the
assessments of the Spring Valley Water
"Works, Market-street Railway Company
and the San Francisco Gaslight Company,
and asks for the removal of these Super
visors from office.
The accusation is a voluminous docu
ment embracing 7000 words. It designates
the people of the State of California as
plaintiffs and the >even Supervisors whose
names are mentioned in the foregoing
paragraph as the defendants.
It is set forth in the accusation that
these Supervisors were duly elected to of
fice. The ward represented by each is
mentioned. The facts that the Assessor
was elected and that he assessed the prop
erty of these corporations and turned
over the assessment roll to the Board of
Supervisors at the time required by law
are contained in the document
The full and complete assessment of
each corporation as returned by the Asses
sor to the Board of Supervisors is set forth
in the accusation. It <s also stated that
the Supervisors were members of tne
Board of Equalization. Mention is made
in due legal form that the notice was pub
lished officially that the Supervisors
wouid sit as a Board of Equalization to
consider applications for equalizing as
sessments. The newspapers in which
these notices were published and the days
of publication are noted. It is further se
forth that the seven Supervisors named as
defendants constituted a quorum at cer
tain sessions of the Board of Equalization.
The accusation then alleges :

fendants, as members of said Board of Equaliza
tion of said City and County of San Francisco,
to meet on the first Monday of July, 1896. to
examine the assessment book and roll pre
pared by the Assessor of said City and County
to equalize the assessment of property.
It is further stated that the Supervisors
did meet to equalize assessments and that
the Snrine Valley Water Works made
written application for a reduction in the
assessment of its franchise for the fiscal
year 1896-97 from $2,500,000 to $1,500,000.
The accusation then, declares :
That the said defendants and each and all of
them, conspiring to delraud said City and
County of a portion of its revenue, and to aid
and assist said Spring Valley Water Works, a
corporation, in evading payment of its just
proportion of taxes, due and to become due
said City and county for the fiscal year
1896-97. and well knowing that any reduction
of the assessment of said franchise below
$2,500,000 was a reduction greatly below its
actual cash value, and on July 20, 1896, each
and all of them willfully, knowingly and cor
ruptly, and with intent to defraud said City
and County of a portion of its revenue, and
with the willful and corrupt intent to aid and
assist said Spring Valley Water Works, a cor
poration as aforesaid, in evading payment of
its just proportion of taxes due and to become
due eald City and County for said fiscal year,
then and there, each and all of them knowing
that any reduction in the assessment of said I
franchise below the sum of $2,500,000 was a
reduction greatly below its actual cash value,
did in their official positions as Supervisors of
said City and County, and as members of the
Board of Equalization, consent, counsel and
agree to the reduction of said assessment on
said franchise from $2,500,000 to $1,500,000,
and did in their said official capacities will
fully, knowingly and corruptly alter and
change, and cause to be altered and changed,
the assessment of said franchise of the Spring
Valley Water Works, so made up and verified
by the Assessor of the City and County, by
then and there changing and altering said
assessment of said Spring Valley Water Works
on said franchise from $2,500,000 to $1,500,
--000, and which said change and alteration was
by said defendants, acting as members of the
Board of Equalization of said City and County,
and being a majority thereof, at their said ses-
si on ordered to be recorded by the clerk of said
board in a book kept for that purpose, and said
assessment of said franchise of said Spring
Valley Water Works lowered by said defend
ants as aforesaid to the sum of $1,500,000, as
the full and actual cash value thereof, now
stands as the assessment of said franchise for
the purposes of taxation in said City and
County for the fiscal year 1896-97 upon the
books of said City and County.
Further accusing the defendants the
Grand Jury alleges that the assessment of
the Market-street Railway Company was
reduced from $2,500,0000 to 12,000,000. In
this count, as in the Spring Valley accu
sation, all the preliminary matter i* re
peated concerning the election of Super
visors, the election of the Assessor, the
assessment of property, the turning over
of the roll, the sittings of the Board of
Equalization, the application of the com
pany for reduction of the assessment of its
franchise, etc. The allegation is also made
that the seven defendants and each and
all of them "willfully, knowingly and cor
ruptly and with intent to defraud said
City and County of a portion of its rev
enue, and with the willful and corrupt
intent to aid and assist said Market-street
Railway Company in evading payment of
its just proportions of taxes due and to
become due, did, in their official positions
as Supervisors and as members of the
Board of Equalization, consent, counsel
and agree to the reduction of the assess
ment from ?2,500,000 to $2,000,000."
It is alleged further that the seven de
fendants, in reducing the assessment of
the San Francisco Gaslight Company from
$1,833, 170 to 11,000,000, did in their official
capacities corruptly and willfully change
the assessment by lowering it.
In the case of the gas company it is fur
ther set forth:
"That the defendants did in their official
capacities willfully, knowingly and cor
ruptly alter, change and cause to be al
tered and changed the assessment on the
improvements on pieces and parcels of
land in San Francisco, more particularly
known and described as block 341 of 100
--vara lots, subdivision 1, located at the
north corner of First and Howard streets,
from $35,000 to $15,000."
The concluding paragraph of the accusa
tion is in this form and language:
Wherefore said Grand Jury prays that said
defendants and each and all of them may be
adjudged guilty of willful and corrupt miscon
duct in office and that they may be each and
all removed from said office of Supervisor of
â¢aid City and County of San Francisco.
Frank Maskey,
Foreman of the Grand Jury of the City and
County of Ban Francisco.
It is understood that the members of the
Grand Jury agreed without hesitation to
the finding of the accusation.
The petition to remove the Supervisors
from office will be assigned to one of the
departments of the Superior Court. The
defendants will have ten days to answer
the accusation.
Regarding this form of proceedings
against the Supervisors District Attorney
Barnes advised with other eminent law
yers.
"This is the first I have heard of any
action on the part of the Grand Jury,"
said Supervisor Scully when seen at his
home late last night. "I came home this
afternoon as soon as the board adjourned
and heard nothing of the matter up to
that time.
'If the Grand Jury has instituted pro
ceedings I am perfectly willing to answer
any anci all questions if called into court.
The Grand Jury has a perfect right to de
mand an explanation if they think thines
are not all right, and lam perfectly will
ing to explain to them anything they
&BK*
"In regard to the reductions in the
assessments of the Spring Valley and
other corporations, I will say that if my
memory does not fail me, it was done
upon the advice of Mr. Siebe. As I re
member it, Mr. Benjamin proposed a
reduction of $1,000,000, and when Mr.
Huehea said he thonerht $500,000 would be
about right Assessor Siebe agreed that
that was about fair. If I had thought
there would nave been so much fun over
the matter, I would have stayed away
irom the meeting. lam thoroughly dis
gusied with the whole business.
"I don't like to accuse anybody, bnt it
seems to me that the Examiner, which is
carrying on the fight, is judging others by
itself. Although the Chronicle repeatedly
accused the Examiner of having received
$30,000 a year from the railroad, I do not
remember that the Examiner made any
refutation of the charge. It would seem
that they themselves receiving mdney
from the railroad were ready to charge
others with receiving money also."
Supervisor King, when asked late last
night if Â«,e wished to make any statement
in regard to the action of the Grand Jury,
responded curtly, "Nothing; nothing at
all."
An attempt was made to see Supervisor
Wagner at his residence on Green street,
but the Supervisor of the Twelfth was not
at home. Supervisors Dunker and Mor
genstern were also denied to interviewers.
"I have very little, if anything, to add
to what I have already said and what has
appeared in The Call," said Supervisor
Benjamin when seen last night at his
residence. "However," he continued, "I
might say that what I did I believed to be
jusi and equitable.
"I do not consider that property in the
possession of a corporation is of any more
value than if it was owned by a private
individual.
"I cannot for the life of me see why
property that was assessed last year at a
certain figure should have increased more
than twice in value since.
"I might mention one case of assess
ment, for instance. The plant of the
Examiner, which I have been informed
cost is only assessed at $50,000.
Why is thii? That "is a question that can
only be answered by the possessor and
the proprietor of that paper.
"Again, there is no franchise to be as
sessed on the electric light company or
telephone company. Now, the Geary
street franchise has been put up for sale,
and the amount offered for it is only $5000.
"Rolling-stock of railroads, like wagons
and buggies, does not increase in value as
years roll by.
"To be brief, I did nothing as a member
of the Board of Equalization but what I
conscientiously believed to be fair and just
as between the City and the parties as
sessed, whether they be individuals or
corporations, and I am not afraid of the
result. It is annoying to be brought into
court, even though there is nothing in the
charge."
The grand jurors were invited to attend
the mass-meeting in Metropolitan Temple
this evening, but they declined the invita
tion as a body. They will probably attend
in their individual capacities.
GOING TO SIBERIA.
Rasaell It. Dunn, Mining Expert, En-
gaged by a Syndicate of
Paris Bankers.
Russell L. Dunn, a well-known mining
expert, who lived for many years at Au
burn in this State, has been summoned by
a syndicate of bankers in Paris to make
an inspection of placer-mining districts on
the Amoor River in Siberia.
Mr. Dunn will leave to-f*<iy or to-,
morrow for New York and b; i for Havre
without delay. He will first go to Paris
to confer with the syndicate and then pro
ceed directly via Moscow and. Irkutsk to a
point in Siberia 2000 miles from the Pacific
Ocean.
The expert has no idea from whom his
recommendation emanated. He has con
tributed much information to the State
Mining Bureau, and it is well known that
the bureau publications have been sought
for by mining men throughout the world.
Mr. Dunn is not exactly informed how
near the railroad will take him to the
region of country to be explored. The
purpose is in his mind to make a com
plete circuit of the globe by crossing the
Pacific on his way home. "Russell Dunn

speaking to an assemblage on Mason and
Market streets, a few minutes after a reli
gious gathering had dispersed, and was
gathered in by Officer Wilson. Yesterday
he was found guilty Dy Police Judge
Joachimsen, who, it is said, threatened to
put Leites under $200 bonds if he de

case to the Superior Court.

RELICS OF THE
WHISKY TRUST.
Local Distillery Sites Will
Be Publicly Sold
To-Day.
M'NULTA IS IN TOWN.
Receiver for the Trust Makes
an Inspection of the
Property.
HE IS WINDING UP AFFAIRS.
Dissatisfaction Among the Stockhold
ers Led to the Collapse in the
Combine.
General John McNulta, the receiver of
the whisky trust, or as it is otherwise
known, the Distillery and Cattle Feeding
Company, is in the City, and his coming
means the closing out of the property of
the trust in tl^s City.
The general purpose for which the
General McNulta.
whisky trust was formed was the control
of the production of whisky north of the
Ohio River, but it was also considered ad
visable to get possession of and to destroy
the two distilleries existing in this City
when the trust came into being. The
trust went into the hands of the receiver
upon the petition of certain stockholders,
who alleged that there had been a great
diversion of the funds, the diversion, in
fact, amounting in total to about $2,000,000.
One allegation was that Greenhut.the pres
ident of the trust, had diverted the money
of the company to his own use. General
McNulta was appointed receiver by the
United States Circuit Court at Chicago.
Upon investigation it appeared that some
thing like $500,000 had gone to procure
favorable legislation to the trust in Western
States.
Nels Morris and Greenhut were the chief
organizers of. the great company. Their

plan was to get possession of all the dis
tilleries which could interfere with their
control over whisky production, paying
the holders by an issue of stock. The
stockholders naturally rebelled when their
dividends fell off, and then came the alle
gations concerning the diversion of moneys
which are alluded to in the foregoing.
All the corn-producing country of the
West made material for the manufac
ture of whisky. The trust controlled,
in addition to San Francisco, the distil
ling business in Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Michigan, Indiana and Illinois, this area j
embracing a lar^e number of distilleries.
The San Francisco distilleries were torn
down when they were acquired. Conse
quently, what General McNulta haÃ come
here to sell consists of the distillery sites,
of which one is at North Beach and the
other in South San Francisco. The sale
will take place to-day in the main en
trance to the Larkin-street wing of the
City Hall at 10 o'clock.
The North Beach property amounts in
total to about one an<i a third blocks, and
that in South San Francisco comprises
parts of three blocks. The sale will be
made under the order of the United States
Circuit Court for the Northern District of
Illinois. The property is situated upon
Lombard, Scott, Chestnut and Pierce
streets. Eighteenth and Nineteenth ave
nues and H street south, etc., the
southside property including the entire
fractional bloc* of 361 and a portion of
block 391.
General McNulta was seen yesterday at
the office of Nowlin & Fassett, who are the
San Francisco attorneys of the receiver.
He said that he came here solely to dis
pose of the trust's property under direc
tion of the Federal court. Yesterday he
made "n inspection of the property, riding
out with Mr. Nowlin to look it over.
General McNulta won his military title
during the Civil War. Prior to occupying
his present position as receiver he was the
receiver of the Wabash Railway system.
He will remain here two or three days,
long enough only to wind up the business
at this end of the line. Then he will pro
ceed directly East.
BURNED THE DEVIL.
Hit Satanic Majesty Cremated by the
Wong family.
The family of Wong, the most powerful
clan in China and by far the most influ
ential Chinese family in California, had a
holiday yesterday. It was their annual
burning of the devil and as he burned
every member of the Wong family was ex
pected to come forward and cast every
grudge and every ill-feeling he held
against a feliow-countryman into the
flames in the shape of a piece of paper
blessed by the priest.
Men were sent out Â»1! over Chinatown
and paper notices to his satanic majesty
weie burned in every street and alley in
the district.
The josshouse was then prepared and
the. good and evil spirits were seated side
by side. Finally the gods were brought
down into Brenham place. Water was
placed in front of them that they might
wash.
Food was then offered them, and wben
they appeared to have enough the "good
spirit" was taken back to the josshouse
and a bontire was made of the devil. In
spite of the burning of the devil the police
will keep an eye on certain members of
the Wong family, for fear they will forget
their vows and again mingle among the
agitators.
