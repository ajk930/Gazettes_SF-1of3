STOCKTON, Cal.. Sept. B.â Stockton is
to-day the hostess city of the Golden
State. Her citizens, one and all, from the
Mayor to the humblest urchin that roams
the streets, have busied themselves in wel
coming the legion of strangers within her
gates. Henceforth "Stocktonian hospit
ality" will be a phrase accepted a.Â« syn
onymous with the most hearty, whole
souled neighborly entertainment man can
extend to man. At least it will mean that
to tho thousands who have to-day felt tne
clasp of the glad hand that the people of
the Mill City have so generously exteuded.
From early dawn, when a company of
Sonora's sons, arrayed in the picturesque
garb of the days of '49, and mounted on
burros, filed into town, to long past mid
night, when the last of the revelers who
participated in the parade sought their
beds, the city was in a state of feverish
excitement. Reception followed recep
tion; parlor after parior was welcomed,
and joyous greetings were exchanged be
tween old friends whose eyes had not
rested upon one another since last year in
Sacramento.
The first trainload of visitors to arrive
hailed from Amador County. There were
five cars in the train, all of them filled to
overflowing. A crowd, whose numbers
were twice those of the Native Sons and
Daughters and their friends, from the ad
joining county, waited at thÂ« depot. As
is usual on such occasions the train was
late. The crowd, good natured and happy,
filled tne platform, overflowed into the
station and impeded the movements of
the baggagemen. Stocktons fair daugh
ters, who equaled in numbers their male
relatives in the crush, were annoyed at
the delay. Little feminine expressions of
vexaiion escaped them as they craned
their necks and strained tneireyes looting
for the longed- for train.
Of course me small boy had to get in his
little joke. When the crowd had become
almost resigned to a long wait a childish
treble piped, "Here she comes." Persons
who had secured comfortable seats on a
number of trunks scattered about iv front
of the baggage-room leaped hurriedly to
their feet. The ladies smoothed their
locks and tucked away stray wisps of hair
that straggled. Some inouired, "Is my
hat on straight?" while others made haste
to gather their traps. When everybody
was on the tiptoe of expectation and had
crowded forward to po:nts of vantage
the boy laughed merrily. "Now, she's
gone back," said he. Tnen he made him
seif scarce to escape annihilation.

All things must have an end. Even a
delayed Soutbern Pacific train must ar
rive, so finally the Amador delegation : ot
in. They were greeted with cheers â three
times three, and a tiger. Escorted by the
Sixth Regiment band, the Sonora miners
and the reception committee, the delega
tion marched up town. At the head of the
parade a tall man wearing a wuite som
brero laboriously piloted a refractory
black bear cub. The applause with which
he was greeted seemed to nonplus little
bruin, and he tugged viciously at the rope
wtioh restrained him, varying the pro
gramme by occasional wild sallies in the
direction of the crowd that, thronged the
sidewalk. People laughed and scattered
and bruin ana his master had the street
to themselves.
The 1:10 o'clock train from San Fran
cisco, bearing the visitors from thM City
and from Antioch, arrived at 2:20 o'clock.
Fourteen day coaches and three Pullmans
discharged over 1000 people at the depot.
Again the miners, the reception committee
and the Sixth Regiment band came to the
front. The visitors were made welcome.
Most of them marshaled into line and
marched to the Courthouse, where the
parade broke up and the different parlors
repaired to their respective quarters.

letters of rooms. Prices have risen nntil
it costs $1 to think of a bed, $2 to look at
a bed or $3 to sleep in one. At 9 o'clock
the belated 8:30 train arrived. Twelve
crowded Pullmans and several day
coaches composed the train. Nearly
everybody aboard was from San Fran
cisco. The new arrivals were escorted
from the station to their quarters in the
courthouse, the nsual reception commit
iee m-mbers, all of w! ica carried torches,
making a torchlight parade of mammoth
proportions.
Oakland and Stanford parlors were sim
ilarly received, the flaring lights carried
by the marchers throwing strange and
fantastic shadows on the liberal decora
tions with which the principal streets are
festooned.
Too much praise cannot be given the
committee having in charge the decora
tions of the city. All the principal streets
are spanned by strips of red, white, blue
and yellow bunting, the carnival cofors.
Along the electric-car line incandescent
lamps of these four colors depend from
the stringers that support the trolley
wires. As far as the eye can reach down
the narrowing vista of the street the lamps
flash and gleam, their soft-shaded hues
bringing to the eye a sense of soothing
harmuny.
The great dome of the courthouse is
ablaze with the combined refulgence of
almost 1000 electric lamps. It is visible for
many miles and to the Knights of the
Golden Bear, who are hastening to this
city to honor the anniversary of the ad
mission of their State to the Union, it is
the beacon that warns them that they are
approaching their journey's end.
Long before the train readies Stockton
the great cone, shining like burnished
gold in a summer sunset, greets the eye.
The little cluster of lights which Bur
mounts the whole resembles a crown, and
is a fitting pinnacle to the mountain of
light beneath.
On the bank of the channel the electric
light company has erected a tower, which
is studded with lights of red, white, blue
and yellow. A number of business
houses have also put up electrical dis
plays. All tne stores are gayiy decorated
in tne prevailing colors.
In the window of one enterprising
firm's business-house is a life-sized grizzly,
whose glaring glass eyes frighten the chil
dren who stop to gaze upon it.
MUSIC AND RED FIRE.

STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. B.â The streets
of Stockton were literally jammed to
night. The afternoon train from San
Francisco brought sixteen carloads of
visiiing natives and their friends, includ
ing 200 members of Antioch Parlor. They
were met at the station by the local par
lor, headed by the Sixth Regiment band,
and escorted to their quarters. With this
crowd in the city and the thousands who
have been coming here for the past few
days the number was augmented at 7
o'clock to-night by the arrival of the train
from Sacramento. It brought an im-
I mense number of natives from the Cap
ital City and other points, and so when
the throng gathered ai the railway station
to-night to witness the coming of the
special cars bearing Oakland and Stanford
parlors, ana of the torchlight procession
j that had been arranged to greet tho in
coming natives, the re was not a foot of
standing room about the depot or for
blocks along Main street.
The streets were brilliantly lighted by
electricity and near the railway station on
i Main street was a huge, illuminated sign,
j bearing words of welcome in eleotricity.
It was expected that the special train
would arrive shortly after 7 o'clock, but its
arrival was delayed until nearly 9.
Tne crowds waited patiently, however, the
band playing from time to time, and for a
half hour before tne arrival of Stanford
and Oakland parlors anvils were fired from
in front of tde railway station. As the
i train came in and car alter car passed
Main street, near the station, the throngs
on that street sent ap cheer after cheer.
Oakland .Parlor ha-i been prepared
to turn' out in parade, but owing to the
j death of youug Wilson, who was drowned
j while on the way to Stockton to partici
i pate in the celebration, it was decided not
ito march in regular procession. However,
several hundred of the members paradea,
i headed by the Presidio band, which after
ward gave a concert on the plaza.
The procession was headed by Marshal
! McNoble and his aids, C. L. Ortman,
I Frank Esnbach, Walter A. Morrissey, VV.
E. O'Connor, M. L. Cady, J. McCann, J.
W. Kerrick, George Bidwell and C. T.

lowed these, and at Main and American
streets, in front of Native Sons' Hall, the
local natives halted. There they were pro
vided with Roman candles, and as the
visiting natives marched down Main
street they passed beneath an arch of col
ored fire. When they reached the grand
arch on the plaza, which had been lighted
by electricity and calcium lights, the dre
worKs which had been prepared for the
occasion were Ret off, and the sky was
filled for an hour afterward with rockets
and bombs.
After passing under the arch and dis
banding on Weber avenue the members of
the visiting parlors went to their head
quarters in the Yosemite building. Many
of them attended the reception that was
given in the rooms of the general commit
tee. This was an informal affair, but was
very enjoyable. Steele's string orchestra
discoursed pleasing mu-ic, while the ladies
of Joaquin Parlor No. 5 served refresh
ments.
The Courthouse dome was a blaze of
light to-night, for, besides tbe 1000 col
ored incandescent lights on the dome,
every window of the big structure was
lighted, and the effect was strikingly
beautiful. Besides ihe lights within the
building and on the dome tbe strings of
Japanese lanterns about the edges of ti:e
main structure were lighted. Out El
Dorado stre t all the large residences were
illuminated, and from Main street to
North, a distance of over a mile, was one
continuous line of liguteu lanterns. In
the trees on many of the residences col
ored electric globes had been placed, and
the effect was wonderful, nothing like it
having ever been seen in this part of the
country before.
Numbers of the Naval Reserve arrived
here during (be day. More reached here
to-night, ;<nd ail will take part in the
street parade to-morrow morning and in
the water carnival at night. The regular
train from San Francisco, due here at
8:20 o'clock, did not get in until 10:55,
with fifteen coaches rilled with unattached
members of the Naive Sons and their
friends, Los Politis Parlor of Livermore
being the only organized parior on board.
It brought the Livermore band, and was
escorted to its headquarters in the same
manner &i the pariors coming earlier. The
local men turned out in force to receive
them, each man burning a stick of colored
fire, the colors being those of the car
nival committee â red, white, blue and
yellow.
The train that brought the largo con

tingent fiom San Francisco reached here
shortly after 1 o'clock. The visiting na
tives were so tired that they were merely
escorted to the courthouse by the recep
tion committee and there disbanded, go- i
ing to their respective headquarters. The
streets were thronged witu spectators in
anticipation of the arrival of the San Fran
ciscans and the crowd was kept in good
humor by one of tne finest pyrotechnic
displays ever seen in this section. For
hours the sky was filled with rockets and
costly pieces of fireworks with which the
committee had arranged to entertain the
crowd and celebrate the arrival of the j
largest portion of the visiting natives.
There are many beautifully decorated
building! here, but the Commeicial Hotel j
is probably ths most lavishly and taste
fully decorated building in the city, with
the exception of the Courthouse.
This morning Policeman Quigler of San
Francisco, who is here on pleasure bent,
narrowly escaped being arrested. Quig
ley is proud of two things in this world;
one is his splendid physique, the other is i
his dog. This morning his desire to have j
both photographed in a fetching attitude ;
induced the policeman to pose on the !
steps of the paper mache statue in front j
of the grand arch. H sat at the feet of i
tbe statue, his eyes turned heavenward,
with the ilog on his lap. Artist Kohm,
wno designed the ti^ure, did not appre
ciate the languorous abandon of Quigley's
position, and neither was he slow to anger
when the weighty policeman broke
through the slight covering of the pedes
tal. Harsh words led to hard blows, and
only the intervention of friends pre
vented both being arrested.

SACRAMENTO. Cal., Sept. B.'â The
State Board of Equalization has raised the
assessment roll of San Francisco 20 per
cent. It' claims there was no other course
for the board to pursue. In vain the mem
bers requested San Francisco authorities
to appear before them and show why the
assessment should not be increased. Their
summons was ignored, and the mass of
evidence in the possession of the board
justified it, say the Equalizers, in making
the raise.
The members of the board claim that,
after careful consideration of the values
returned by the County Assessors through
out the State, tbe assessments of at least
five out of the nine cited to appear before
them were too low in comparison with the
other counties of the .State, and they also
claim that San Francisco's assessment was
the lowest of all, in comparison with its
monetary interests.
At the opening of to-day's session,
Equalizer Beamer moved to begin pro
ceeding by considering the assessment of
San Francisco County. Chesebrou^h im
mediately secured the floor and said that
ha did not purpose making rurther de
fense for his county. He thought he had
made all the defense necessary and did
not wish to take up more time. Sut Fran
cisco, he said, had come before the board
with an increase over last year's assess
ment and he thought her roll should be
allowed to stand as returned by the Audi
tor. He declared that he had done all
that he could for San Francisco County,
and moved that the board accept the Audi
tor's returns from all counties as the
properly assessed valuation of the counties.
Coigan seconded the motion, and Ar
nold said he thought there was a
motion before the house already in
relation to San Francisco. Beamer
had moved to take it up, he said,
and he had seconded the motion. Beam
er's motion was then put and carried, Ar
nold, Beamer and Morehouse voting aye,
and Colcan and Chesebrougn no.
CheÂ«ebrouj?h then moved to pass San
Francisco, and this motion was lost Dy the
same vote.
Arnold moved to raise San Francisco's
assessment 25 per cent. He explained
that he did thi* because he thought that.

inasmuch as Los Angeles bad appeared
before the board with a raise oi 30 per
cent, San Francisco should do as much.
It had increased its roll about 5 per cent,
and if his motion was carried he thought
it would equalize matters between the two
counties.
Chesebrough remarked that the roll of
Los Angeles County had been increased
because its Assessor had promised the
board to do so last year. He thought the
raise was pretty big, and did not think it
fair to aliow Los Angeles to set the pace
for San Francisco.
There was no second to Arnold's mo
tion, and Beamer moved to raise San
Francisco 20 per cent. This was seconded
by Moretwuse and the motion was carried.
AyeA ye8 â Arnold, Beamer, Morehouse.
Noesâ Chesebrough, Colgan.
Beamer then moved to raise Alameda
County 10 per cent, but there was no sec
ond, and Arnold moved to raise it 5 per
cent, saying that this, he thought, would
bring it on a par with Los Angeles. More
house seconded the motion and it was car
ried. Arnold. Beamer and Morehouse
voted aye, Colgan voted no, and Chese
brough refused to vote.
Arnold moved to decrease Monterey 5
per cent. Colgan raised the point that 5
per cent amounted to so little that it was
scarcely worth the time and trouble of
figuring ihe rolls. Morehouse seconded
Arnold's motion.
Ayesâ Arnold, Beamer, Morehouse, Col
gan.
Noes â Chesebrough.
Beamer next moved, to raise Sacramento
10 per cent. Morehouse said that Sacra
mento's total was $33,000,000. Of this
about $3,000,000 was for business property
along J and X streets. With the excep
tion of the business property Sacramento
was well assessed and he thought it would
be hard to raise the whole county 10 per
cent in order to get the business property
up to nearer its true value. As there was
no second to Beamer's motion Arnold
moved to raise Sacramento s percent. This
was seconded by Morehouse.
Ayesâ Arnold, Beamer, Chesebrough,
Morehouse.
Noes â Colgan.
By the same vote San Bernardino
County was raised 5 per cent.
Chesebrough then successively moved
to raise Butte and Solano counties, but
could get no seconds. He then moved to
raise Santa Clara 10 per cent, which was
amended by Arnold to 5 per cent and the
amendment carried, Arnold, Beamer and
Morehouse voting aye and Chesebrough
and Colgan voting no.
San Diego County was decreased 5 per
cent by unanimous vote of the board.
A motion to reconsider Alameda was
carried, but resulted in no change of the
raise of 5 per cent.
A motion to reconsider San Diego was
carried, and on final action its assessment
was reduced 10 per cent, Morebouse, Col
gan and Arnold voting aye and Beamer
and Chesebrough no.
Chesebrough moved to increase San
Jiateo 10 per cent. The county had been
cited before the board, and there was no
second to the motion.
The board adjourned to give the secre
tary time to figure up the rate of the tax
levy, and half au hour later this was an
nounced as 42.9. Without increases by
the board the levy would have been 2 cents
higher than this.
The board's action has increased the
total assessed property of the State $74 -
113,818.
WHAT IT MEANS.
San Francisco Must Pay Taxes on $64,
-481,478 of Increased Valuation.
The raising of the total valuation of San
Francisco property 20 per cent means that
the citizens of this City must pay taxes on
$64,481,476 more than Assessor Siebe found
to assess.
Accordine to the figures as they were es
tablished by the Board of Supervisors
after the Assessor was through with them
the total valuation of taxable property in
this City for City and State purposes was
$357,586,126, but as it now stands the City
must pay on $422,067,604. The real-estate
roll of $275,334,295 is raised to $330,401,154,
and the personal property roli oi $47 073 -
097 to $56,487,716. There is $35,178 734 in
personal property and real estate exempt
from the raise.
By these figures, if the State rate is the
same as last year, San Francisco must
bear an additional burden of about $350,
-000 to assist in paying State expenses.
Assessor Siebe was a pretty angry man
when seen last evening in regard to the
raise and expressed himself lreely on the
subject.
"It looks to me as though this was a
move on the part of the railroad com
pany, through its friends Morebouse and
Beamer," he said, "for the railroad will
benefit most by this unwarranted raise.
"This is an injustice that it is hard to
speak too strongly about. In spite of
hard times and depression in values we
raised valuations about $30,000,000 over
last year, and even leaving out the
amount assessed to the banks and claimed
by them to be exempt the increase
amounts to $24 000,000, yet we are raised
over $64,000,000 more simply because if
San Francisco is given a big raise the
State rate will be lower. The larger por
tion of the railroad property is outside of
San Francisco. We assessed this City
with more than usual care this year and I
do not think the valuation should be
raised one dollar, much less $64,000,000."
Auditor Broderick was also indignant
when he heard through a telegram irom
Sacramento that the valuation of San
Francisco property had been given such a
heavy raise.
"Well, ttie job went through this time
where it failed at others," he said, "and
those who expect to made capital by
saddling a bin slice of tue State expensed
on San Francisco have had their way.
"It looks to me as though some of those
people at Bacramento were afraid that the
State would not eet all of its money out of
San Francisco, in spite of the fact that,
leaving out all doubtful assessments, our
total valuation was over $20,000,000 more
than last year.
"It appears as though the whole thing
rested with Arnold of .Los Angeles, and
that he was not there when wanted.
"This will work a big hardship on many
poor people in this City, wnose property
to-day is not worth a dollar more than it
is assessed for, and who will be badly
crowded to pay 20 percent more than they
are already assessed."
"I am simply astonished," said Super
vieor Taylor, chairman of the Finance
Committee, "that the State Board of
Equalization should have dared to put
this outrage on San Francisco. Valua
tions, except in a few instances where the
Assessor's figures were very materially al
tered, were fully as much as they should
have been, and the States portion at tne
rate that was established last year would
have been $150,000 greater than last year.
"I supposb there is no way out of it
now, and we will have to ray a good por
tion of the State's expenses."

Spiritual.
Temperance Raiiy Followed by a
"Camp Fire" of Army
Veterans.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Sept. 8.-The
Caliiornia Conference of the Methodist
Episcopal church will begin its annual
session here at 9 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing. Many clergymen and their families
are here, andj at present the number of
people attracted by the conference bids
fair to exceed tnat of last year.
Bishop C. D. Foss of Philadelphia, who
will preside over and direct the conference,
is here. He has presided at over 120 con
ferences.
â  To-night the conference temperance an
niversary was held. The Methodist
Church was crowded to the gallery, and
very fervent were the ameus that respond
ed to the points and periods of the speak
ers. The principal address was delivered
by Rev. S. J. Carroll, D.D., of East Oak
land. He expressed great confidence that
the church would ultimately triumph
in the fight against the saloon. Another
address was delivered by Rev. F. D.
Bovard, D.D., of Alameda on ''The Anti-
Saloon League." This is a new temper
ance organization which was indorsed by
the last general conference of the church.
After the temperance rally there was a
"camp" fire in the church, at which most
of the large audience remained. The
Army Veterans' Club of the conference
holds a reunion at each annual session.
The membership of the club is composed
of ministers and laymen who were soldiers
in the late Civil War. About thirty
veterans sat on the pulpit.
The following was the programme:'
Opening address, Comrade E. R. Dille, I
president; "The Soldier in His Teens,
Comrade Eli McClish; "The Martial
Spirit of Methodism," Comrade E. D. Me-
Creary; "The Loyal Women During the
Late War," Mrs. Comrade G. D. Kellogg.
The active committee in connection with
the camp tire was Comrades A. T. Need
ham, W. F. Warren and Jan.es Williams.
The camp fire was followed by a collation
to invited guests only.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1896.
WORDS, WORDS BY
WILLIAM BRYAN
Busy Day of the Nebraskan
After His Return to
Lincoln.
NOTIFIED BY SILVERITES
Accepts the Nomination on Be
half of Himself and
Sewall.
NEW ARGUMENTS ADVANCED.
Peculiar Attempt to Justify Republi
cans in Bolting the Sc. Lou s
Convention.
LINCOLN, Nebk., Sept. B.â The National
silver party, through its regularly ap
pointed committee to-night, formally
notified William J. Bryan of his nomina
tion by its convention at St. Louis. The
ceremonies attending the notification were
in strong contrast to those with the meet
ing at Madison-square Garden last month,
when Mr. Bryan and Sewali were officially
informed that they were the choice of the
Chicago convention. Instead of the
spacious auditorium with its boxes and
galleries, to-night's function took place in
the open air on the plaza and lawn iv
front of Nebraska's State Capitol building.
With the exception of those seated In a
few score of chairs on the speaker's plat
form and directly In front of it, all the
audience was standing. The only thing
in common with the Madison-square meet
ing was the heat, which while not nearly
of the intensity of that in New York on
the night of August 12, coming after a
cool spell was sufficient to be uncomfort
able.
The big electric light above the stand
developed a plague of pestiferous bugs,
much to the discomfort of the members of
the notification committee and the others
gathered on the stand. But the most
marked difference between to-night's cere
monies and those in New York was the
fact that Mr. Bryan did not read his
speech in answer to the information for
mally given by the committee of the Sil
ver party. He made a speech neither long
nor short, without the aid of notes, and
was frequently applauded.
Lincoln's appreciation of Mr. Bryan's
second visit home since bis nomination
'vas shown by indefatigable parading of
free-silver clubs. The display of fireworks
and frequent exercise of lung power
through tin horns and the good old-fash
ioned yell. A big crowd received the can
didate on his arrival from Chicago this
morning, and he was escorted to his home
by brass bands and campaign organisa
tions. There were more brass bands and
a larger number of marching clubs in a
parade that accompanied Mr. Fryan later
in the day to the State Hen ;e, where a
good-sized audience assembled to hear him
deliver a political address.
To-night a t.ird parade occurred, and
flambeau clubs aiid organizations of
mounted men bearing transparencies and
torches and firing skyrockets and Roman
candles gave vent to their political enthu
siasm in a way that bordered on delirium.
It was 9 o'clock before the first of the
flaring flambeaus heading the candidate's
escort were spied by those at the Capitol
as their bearers turned into Fifteenth
street, the thoroughfare leading to the
stand.
Twenty minutes later Mr. Bryan ap
peared on the platform and the crowd in
creased with great rapidity after the pro
cession was under way, and cheered him
repeatedly as his well-known figure was
recognized. The space in front of the
stand and for several hundred feet was
black with people. Norris Humphrey of
Lincoln called th 9 assemblage to order,
and in a few words presented George A.
Groot of Ohio, chairman of the committee
appointed by th* National Silver Conven
tion to notify Mr. Bryan of his nomina
tion by that body. The other mem
bers of the notification committee and

After talking for an hour in support of
tree coinage Mr. Groot concluded as
follows?
The Sliver party In convention assembled
adopted a platform which presents the issues
involved in this campaign more clearly and
definitely and cogently than any other plat
form that has been presented to the people.
The platforms of these different parties and
the discussions, pui.lic and private, that are
now going on in this country upon the money
question, ihe only one that is involved In this
campaign, clearly indicate that the peopie are
beginning to understand that question and
that they propose this year to asr-ert their
political independence of all political organi
zations and political bosses and vote in their
own interest and in the interest of good gov
ernment, and stamp out the "British gold
standard" in this country, root and branch.
Turning to Bryan Mr. Groot said:
Hon. William Jennings Bryan: The National
Silver Convention with a uuanimity unex
ampled In the history ot National conventions
In this country, nominated you as tho candi
date of the National silver party for the dis
tinguished office of President of (be United
States. You are now the candidate for the
great office of President of three great political
parties, of which the Silver party Is not the
least.
The convention selected a committee to
formally notify you of its action, and thatcom
mittee conferred upon me the distinguished
honor of advihins you of your nomination as
the candidate of the National Sliver party for
office as President of the United States. We
are met, therefore, at this time and place for
the purpose of performing the pleasant duty
imposed upon us by the convention. 1 there
fore, in obedience to the wishes ot the com
mittee of that convention, hereby formally
notify you that you have been nominated by
the National Silver party as its candidate for
I'resident. and request that you accept that
nomination in the same spirit in which it has
boon tendered you.
You ure now the chosen commander of a
grand army composed of three grand divisions
vvliich is now mobilizing for the purpose of
fighting in behalf of humanity on November
3, 1890, the most important political battle of
this or of any other age; a battle which is to
determine whether this Nation shall be a
province of Great Britain and be governed
and controlled as that nation is by the money
barons of Europe or whether it shall be as the
fathers intended it to be, a Iree and independ
ent and sovereign nation.
The people who constitute that grand army,
Inspired as they are by the noblest sentiments
of patriotism, under your leadership will,
there can be no doubt, on that day Ift high
their banners in triumph over tUe defeated
allied hosts of plutocracy.
It was 10:20 o'clock when Mr. Groot con
cluded and Mr. Bryan began his speech.
He said;
Mr. Chairman, chairman ofjthe notification
party and members of that committee: I beg
to reply at this time without the formality of
a letter. The platform adopted by the silver
convention contains but one plank, and that
plank, the plank upon the money question or
upon the silver question, is identical in sub
stance with, the silver plank of the Chicago
platform. As I have already discussed at
length that plank and it will not be necessary
to enter into any extended discussion at this
time, 1 beg to as-ure the committee that I ac
cept the nomination so generously tendered
by them on behalf of the Silver party in the
spirit in which that nomination was pre
sented. [Cheers.] I can appreciate tne feel
ing which animated those who assembled in
that convention, I can appreciate the hesita
tion in which they assembled there and turned
their backs upon the party with which they
had been associated.
I know something of the strength of the
parties, because I was In a position where
I looked forward to a possibility of like action
on my own part. I can appreciate the depths
of a conviction that led mem to place the in
terests of their country above the welfare of
their party. [Long cheering and shouts of
"Good/] More than a year ago, when we
were engaged in a struggle to bring the Demo
cratic party to an indorsement of free coinage,
the question was cut to me whether, in case
of failure, I would support the Democratic
nominee if he were on a gold standard plat
form. I never believed that such action was
probable In the Democratic party, but when
those who questioned me were not content
with probabilities, but asked again whether
in the case of that event I would support the
nominee I said, as you will remember, that
under no circumstances wo,uld my vote be
eiven to the man who would In the executive
office use his influence to fasten the gold stand
ard upon the American people. [Great cheer
ing.]
My convictions upon this subject are not
shallow oonvictions. I may be in error, my
friends; none of us can claim infallibility.
But we have experience of history to guide us
and our judgment and our consciences, and I
stand where the members of the silver conven
tion stood. I would rather have the approv
al of my conscience than the applause of the
entire earth. I may be In error, but I believe
that the gold standard is a conspiracy against
the human race, [Cheers.]
I would no sooner join the ranks of those
whose purpose is to fasten that upon the
people than to enlist in an army that was
marching to attack my home and kill my
family. [Renewed cheering.] I can say,
therefore, that I can appreciate the spirit
which animated those who have just tendered
me this second nomination, and I can there
fore accept it in the spirit in which they pre
sent it. And I pledge them that if elected
they shall never nave cause to accuse me of
being false to that trust. [More cheering.]
My friends, when I declared that I would
not support a gold standard candidate I was
standing upon the history of the Democratic
party. I was defending its principles as well
as the interests or the country at large. And
when these Republicans who assembled in the
silver convention at St. Louis refused to
worship the golden image which their party
had set up they were defending the history of
the Republican party. [Applause] The Re
publican platform of 1883 denounces the
Democratic administration for having at
tempted to degrade silver. And in 1891 on
the 11th day of February in Memorial Hall at
Toledo. Ohio, on the Lincoln day bauquet, the
present candidate for President upon the Re
publican ticket used the words which 1 shall
now read to you. I have found these words
published in a Toledo paper, and they have
been published so long without correction
that we may safely assume that he was cor
rectly reported. If he shall deny the correct
ness of this report I shall hasten to do him
justice by retracting these words. These are
the words which he is said to have used :
"During all of Grover Cleveland's years at
the head of the Government he was dishonor
ing one of our precious metals, one of our own
great productsâ discrediting silver and en
hancing the price of gold. He endeavored
even it-fore his Inauguration to office to stop
the coinage of silver dollars, and afterward
and to the end of his administration persist
ently used his power to that end. He was de
termined to contract the circulating medium
and demonetize one of the coins of commerce,
limit the volume of money among the people
make money scarce and therefore dear. He
would have Increased the value of money and
diminished the value of everything elseâ
money' the man , everything else the sei
vant." [Great cheering.]
Following these same lines the Republican
Convention in 1*92 declared at Minneapolis
that the American people, from tradition and
interest, were in favor of bimetallism. [A
voice, "That's so.] That is the language in
1892 that the American people, from tradition
ana interest, are In favor of bimetallism.
Have traditions changed In four years? [A
voice. "No."] Have interests cnanged In four
years? [A voice, "No."] No, my friends, and
yet, forgetting the platlorinof 1830, forgetting
the denunciation uttered by their distin
guished leader in 1891, forgetting the plat
lorm of 1892, the Republican party in conven
tion assembled declared that the Amer.can
people must forego the advantages of the bi
metallic system to which tradition and inter
est indorsed them until foreign nations should
bring these advantages to them. [Applause 1
It is not'strange that men who had looked lor
bimetallism in the Republican puny should
have given up hope and turned elsewhere for
relief.
These Republicans cannot be criticized for
leaving the Republican party. They have done
what every American citizen has a right to do.
They have done better than our Democratic
advocates of the gold standard have done, be
cause these Republicans when they left the
party joined with those who had a chance to
succeed, while our Democratic advocates of the
gold standard sought to secure the election of
a Republican, McKlnley, by nominating a
Democratic candidate. [Cries of "That's so."]
To show you that the action of these Republi
cans is defended by experience and by exam
ple, let me carry you back to the period just
preceding the war. If you will turn to a book
recently published, entitled "John .Sherman's
Recollections" [laughter], you will find on page
112 of the first volume a portion of a speech
which he delivered in Congress in 1856. Let
me read this extract:
"I am willing to stand by the compromises of
1820 and 1850; hut when our Whig brethren
of the South allow this administration to lead
them off from their principles, when they
abandon the position which Henry Clay
would have taken, forget his name and
achievements and decline any longer to carry
his banner, they lose all their claims on me.
And I say now that until this wrong is righted,
until Kansas is aamitted as a tree State, I
cannot act in party association with them."
There was the distinguished Senator from
Ohio asserting to the people of this country
upon the floor of Congress that he was willing
to accept compromise after compromise, but
that the time bad at last come when he could
go with them no longer; that until certain
things were accomplished he could not act
with them. The situation to-day is but a repe
tition of history. Compromise after compro
mise has been submitted to by these silver Re
publicans in the hope that the party of their
choice and love would a: last bring to the
people the relief which they desired.
But the Republican party, as in 1856,
has been led eff by another administration,
until it has deserted its traditions and its
platform, and these Republicans have a right
to say to their Republican associates, "We will
go with you no longer until this Nation is re
deemed." [Applause.]
We do not ask those who present this nomi
nation to pledge their future services to the
Democratic party. The same intelligence
which directs them to-day In the discharge of
this duty will be with them four years from
now to direct them then In the discharge of
the duties that will then arise. The same
patriotism that leads them to-day in what
they do will be with them four years from now
to guide and direct them. We trust them now,
we shall trust them then. The Democratic
party has proven itself worthy of their, confi
dence to-day and it receives their support. ; If
four years from now it proves unworthy of
their confidence it should not then have their
support. [Applause and cries of "That's
rleht; that's the way to talk."]
The chairman of the notification committee
has told you that we have to meet to-day a
great money trust. He is right We are con
fronted to-day by the most gigantic trust that
has ever been formed among men. Talk about
trust In various articles which we produce!
My mend*, all these trusts together tall Into
insignificance when compared with the money
trusts which has its bands upon our country.
[A. voice: "Thai's so."] Place the control of
the standard money of the world in the hanas
of ft . lew great financiers and times will be
good for them, no matter what distress may
overtake the rest ot mankind. I believe that
John G. Carlisle did not exaggerate the truth
when he said: "The consummation of this
scheme menus more of misery to the human
race than all the wars, pestilences and famines
5" ever occurred in the history of the world."
lit rtoes not stand appalled before misery
like that? Who among you is willing to be a
partner in a Conspiracy that has for its object
the consummation of that scheme? [A voiceâ
nobody."] It is against the consummation
01 this scheme so eloquently, and so forcibly
described that the sliver Republicans have
ar . 1! : cn LvL v protest. I respect the convictions
which have led them. I thank you for the
support which they have tendered and all that
iOIIIIIITBITIW*nTTffTB' ifiirWiTTrrrniii â r rrrf 1 n i
I can promise Is that I shall, to the best of mv
ability, endeavor to prove worthy of their con
fidence. [Applause.]
After Mr. Bryan concluded Mr. fiarrin?
ton of the notification committee notified
him of Mr. Sewall's nomination and the
Presidential candidate made a brief re
sponse, accepting in behalf of his running
mate.
AN AFTERNOOM CRATION.
Bryan Talk* About the Rule of Trusts
and Syndicates.
LINCOLN, Nbbk., Sept. B.â ln the after
noon a mass-meeting was held in front of
the State Capitol building. A parade
composed of Bryan flambeau clubs, free
silver clubs, some in uniform and some in
plain dres3, and floats bearing free silver
devices were in attendance. The parade
formed at City Hall square and escorted
Mr. Bryan to the Staie House. He -rode
with Mrs. Bryan, Lawrence Humphrey,
chairman of the local reception commit
tee, and George A. Groat, chairman of the
National Silver Notification Committee.
As the head of the procession neared the
Capitol grounds a salute was fired by a
volunteer battery. The stand from which
Mr. Bryan spoke bad been erected on the
north front of the State Eouse.
It was covered with bunting, and the
walls of the building were also decorated.
A large photograph of the Democratic
nominee above the platform was rivaled
by many little photographs of McKinley
and Hobart, which some of the Repub
lican State officeholders had placed in the
windows of their offices and then gone
away after locking the aoors, Among
those who had seats on the stage were
John A. Creighton of Omaha, John I.
Martin of Missouri, who was se>-geant-at
arms of the Democratic National Conven
tion, Governor Hoicoinb of Nebraska,
Ignatius Donnelly, Chairman George A.
Groat and a numberof the members of t lie
Silver party notification committee. Five
thousand people crowded the grounds, in
the hot sun, about the stand, and cheered
repeatedly as Mr. Bryan appeared. He
was introduced by E. E. Brown, a former
Republican and president of the First
National Bank of Lincoln. Mr. Bryan
said :
Ladies and gentlemen: lam only going ot
talk to you a little while. There are others
here who are prepared to discuss the issues of
the campaign iv your presence, and 1 am try
ing to do as little work as possible. I think 1
have been doing my thare so far as time is con
cerned. [Cries of "You are right."] It is now
iust about one month since I left Nebraska
and turned eastward. It has been an inter
esting trip. I want to assure you that the
sentiment in favor of the free coinage of silver
is a growing sentiment. [Applause.] It far
surpassed my expectations in the East, and I
found among those people the producers of
wealth, the farmers and the laborers, who are
joining with you to free themselves from the
domination of those financial institutions
which have controlled our legislation and our
financial policies. [Applause.]
You will find in the very shadow of Wall
street as bitter hatred to the influences from
which you have suffered as you will find
among the farmers of Nebraska [applause],
and all throush the East I found farmers who
had been Republicans who were openly sup
porting the iree coinage of silver and were as
serting that they had as much right to attend
to their business as the New York banker had
to attend to his business. [Applause.] As
against the maintenance of a gold standard,
either for one day or forever, the Democratic
party has declared for the immediate restora
tion of the money of the constitution. [Ap
plause.] The Silver party and the Populist
party have joined with the bi-mocratic party
in mukiug this the paramount issue of the
campaign. Our opponents bugan the cam
paign by asserting that the American people
were not able to establish bimetallism, and
when they found a revolt among the Ameri
can people against such a policy they com
menced a system of coercion and terrorizing,
insisting that the masses of the people even
have not the right to determine what kind of
policy they want. (Applause.]
This terrorism auu coercion Is manifested in
two ways.
In the first place the heads of many great
corporations are undertaking to compel their
employes to support the gold standard. My
frietiti.-. if the head- ol (hose corporations as
sert the right to control the votes of those who
work for them we have presented to the
American peop'e even a greater question than
the silver question. [Applause.] lfacorpora
tion has me right to control the vote of an
employe on one question, it has the right to
control it on every other question. [Cries of
"Right you are I" and applause.]
My friends, do you trunk you are under a
government of the people? 1 want to Â«sk you
what will be the result if we get to be a gov
ernment by banks. [Applaus*-.] If we could
trust our affairs to a New York banker we
might endure It for a time, but when you re
member that the New York banker is under
the control of the London banker I ask yon to
ri- fleet before you submit the destinies of a free
peopie to a few financiers. [Applause.]
We had a failure in this city last winter; a
failure which, in my judgment, was largely
due to the sale of bonds and to the fact tnat
the Eftstern bank was drawing in money from
circulation, from business, from the channels
ot trade to invest in Government bonds. If.
my friends, you have a financial rolicy which
permits a few financiers to close your banks at
will and swallow up your deposits and impov
erish your people I want to ask you if it is not
time for you to consider whether this cannot
be stopped. [Cheers.] We have been told that
we cannot borrow money from abroad unless
we have a financial system that is satisfactory
to the people abroad. My friends, you let them
control your fiuanetal system and you will
never see a time when you can get out of the
clutches of those who are dominating your
financial policy. [Great cheering.]
Talk about arraying one class against an
other! I want to ask you why it is that every
Democrat who is interested iv a syndicate or
a trust or has a salary from a railroad cor
poration that is more than his other property
1 want to ask you why they are all arrayed
against the Democratic party? [Cheers.] Why
is ii? It is because tho Democratic party has
declared against the issue of bonds in time of
peace and the trafficking with syndicates.
["That's right." from the crowd.] It'is because
the Democratic party is opposed to the trusts
and the prices which the trusts have insti
tuted. It is because the Democratic party be
lieves In the control, the regulation and the
restriction of all corporations so that they will
serve the purpose tor which they were allowed
to exist. [Great cheering.]
If those connected wnu trusts are flocking
together in the Republican party may we not
appeal to all the smaller business men who
have felt tne iron heel of the trust and who
have been driven out of business by its unlaw
ful competition? [Cheers.] If we are to lose
all the attorneys of these great trusts [Aery
of "Let them go"] may we not appeal with
confidence to the support of the people who
have been plundered by these trusts while
their attorneys have received a part of the
plunder? [Cheers and shouts of "Yes."] We
are not responsible for the arrayiug of one
class against anoiher. These people have de
fined the business class to be a few of not the pro
ducers of wealth but the exchangers of wealth
or those who try to corner our wealth and'
they are trying to array them against the rest
of the people.
The Republican platform In the Btate of New
York said that we ought to have a business
administration conducted by business men in
l>ehalf of the bu^ine^s interests of the country
What do they mean by that? bo they call
farmers business men? [Cheers and cries of
â¢'No. 1 ] Oh.no; simply producers of wealth.
But it a man goes on the Board of Trade and
makes more in an hour betting on the price of
what you raise than you make in a year he be
comes a business man. These people who have
attempted to array a few of the people against
the rest cf the people and who have insisted
that the affairs of this Government should be
put in the hands of a few menâ when we have
complained what euphonious names they have
given to ue! They have been calling us dis
turbers of the public peace and they have
called us anarchists, my Irieuds. [Great a p-
My friends, these terms simply express the'
contempt which they have tor the great mass
of the people of this country. [Cries of
"They ye been doiug it for twenty-five years."]
These names they call us simply prove that
iluy are not wii.mg to trust the destinies of
this Republic in the hands of the people who
have created its wealth in times ot peace and
who have fought its battles la times of war.
[Cheers.] Show me these people who now call
us anarchists and I will show you a class of
peopie who, if we had war, would never go to
the front, but taay are the very people who
slander those who would fight the battles to
save their own property. [Applause and
cheers.]
Mr. Bryan said that vrhen he was called a
disturber of the public peace it was grati
iying to meet the toilers of his own city
who indorse him as one they were willing
to trust. He said he expected a majority
of this â Lancasterâ county, and a ma
jority of not less than 25.000 in Nebraska.
He thought even this majority was not
large enough. Continuin ,he said:
My frienda, gentlemen down in New York
called attention to the fact that sentiment was
all on our side in this campaign, and one man
said that a man could now write a poem in
favor of syndicates running the busine&s of
this country. [Applause.] Do you know what
word rhymes with syndicate? It is hate, and
you canuot write a poem and you cannot sing
a song in favor ot the syndicates controlling
the financial policies of this Nation because
while their policy applies to hate, the man
who thinks and the heart of the man who feels
the force oi the financial policy that has been
forced upon this country which they want to
continue until foreign nations come to our niii
aud assistance. It is a sentiment that appeals
to the pocket-book, and overshadows the ap
peal to the best feeling of man. [Applause.]
Now I must stop or I will make a spench. [Cries
of "Go on, we haven't half enough."] You
know that I woulJ haie awfully to have the
Xiw York papers say that I had driveu an
audience away in my own town.
Prolonged cheering followed t' c con
clusion of Mr. Bryan's speech. He was
followed by Mr. Groat, and the assemblage
dispersed.
THOUSAND OF PUTEN LUST.
Republican* Badly Cheated in. Arkansas
by the. Itt-wnorrats.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Sept. B.â Returns
received at Republican headquarters from
Washington, Woodruff, Carroll, Lonoke,
Crawford, Jackson, Pulaski, Ouachita, Se
bastian, White and Desha counties show a
net Republican gain of 4201 over the vote
of two years ago. These ligures in main
tained throughout the estate will increase
the Republican vote over 1894 by 20,000
and place the entire vote for the Republi
can ticket at 46,000, an increase of 23 per
cent
Returns from Prairie, Drew. Ashley,
Washington, Crawford, Greene, Desha,
Independence, Cleveland, Ouachitu, Brad
ley, Jackson and Johnson received at
Democratic headquarters show a loss to
the Democracy of 3383.
On this basis this will give Jones a plu
rality of 52,000, estimating that 140,000
votes were cast. Chairman Cooper of the
Republican State Committee made the
following statement for the press to-night:
"T c election law plainly directs that
the judges of election shall not all be of
tue same political party, and when the
Democratic Election Commissioners,
against the earnest protest of Republi
cans, appointed Democratic election
judges exclusively in over twenty coun
ties of this State in violation of the law, it
was pertectly well understood that fraud
was intended. I do not hesitate to say
that the appointment of these Democratic
judges and the refusal to appoint one Re
pubhean cost the Republican ticket thou
sands of votes and added to the Demo
cratic votes.
"Clark admits that in a number of coun
ties a number of Democratic committees
appointed none but Democratic judges,
and he is at a loss to know why they did
this, especially in his home county of
Phillips. That will be the question asked
oy every honest man. Notwithstanding
all these frauds he estimated the vote of
Ilemmsel, the Republican candidate for
Governor, has increased 50 per cent over
his vote in 1894. The silver question
has not increased the Democratic vote or
decreased the Republican vote in this
State."
A Strong Gold Sentiment.
CHICAGO, Ili*., Sept. B.â Chairman
Bynum of the National Democratic Com
mittee secured headquarters at the Palmer
House for the campaign committee. He
expects to open the headquarters a week
from next Monday.
Congressman Sperry of Connecticut, a
Democrat who has been making an exten
sive tour of the West, called at the Palmer
House headquarters. He said he was sur
prised to find a strong gold sentiment in
lowa, where he had been inlormed Bryan
had thousands of Republican followers.
He predicted tnat Connecticut would give
McKinley a good majority.
South Carolina's Primarff.
CHARLESTON, S. 0., Sept. B.â There
is intense excitement throughout South
Carolina to-day over the primary election.
At the Democratic primary election held
a few weeks ago the people voted for the
first time directly for a United States
Senator. Three candidates were in the
field and none of them received a majority
of the votes cast, so that the race is made
over again to-day by Judge Joseph H.
Earle and Governor John Gary Evans.
Out of 55,000 votfs reported Earle is
12,000 ahead. Indications are that Earle
will be elected by 8000 to 10,000 majority.
Colorado* Convenixons.
DENVER, Cou>., Sept. B.â Three State
conventions are to be held to-morrow, the
Siiver party and Republicans in Denver
and the Populists in Pueblo. The former
will indorse Bryan and Sewall electors,
acting under the authority of the regu
larly constructed State committee of the
Republican party, of which R. W. Broad
is chairman, vice Irving Holbert resigned.
The McKinleyites, who controlled the
State committee and elected J. W. Hodges
chairman, lay claim to the eagle emblem,
and their convention takes place later in
the month. While each of to-morrow's
conventions will strive for fusion on a
State ticket, as well as for Bryan and
Sewall electors, their action cannot be
safely predicted in advance.
Fusion Ifilh Populists.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Sept. B.â The Demo
cratic State Central Committee of Missouri
met here to-day and fixed a basis for fusion
with the People's party on the electoral
ticket. It was decided to withdraw three
district electors and one elector at large.
The vacancies will be filled by Populists.

CZAR NICHOLAS' TRAVELS.
Visit of the Emperor and Empress of
Russia Yet Causing Enthusiasm
in Germany.
BERLIN, Germany, Sept. B.â The Em
peror and the royal guests left Goerlitz at
7:30 o'clock this morning. The party were
driven in carriages to Radineritz, north of
Lobau, where they mounted horses and
the Emperor, with Lord Beresford on one
side of him and Lord Londsdale on the
other, witnessed the military maneuvers
and moclc battle from the Kittlitz Heights.
The first coming together or the opposing
forces was the advance of the Saxon cav
alry division, whicn was brought to a stand
still at noon by the Prussian cavalry, sup
ported^ by the Fifth Army Corps under
General Count Waldersee, whose head
quarters were located at Weis*enberg.
KIEL, Germany Sept. B.â The Czar and
Czirina arrived ' here to-day. Their
majesties were receive' 1 , at the station by
Prince Henry of* Prussia and his wife.
Princess Irene. The Imperial visitors en
tered carriages and were driven to the
Jensen Bridge, where they embarked on
board a steam launch and were conveyed
to the Schlos*.
The Czar and Czarina were enthusias
tically etieered by the people. The Ger
man fleet in the harbor was covered with
bunting and each vessel flew the Russian
Bag from the maintop in honor of the
Cz:>r.
The stay of their majesties here wai a
short one. The Polar Star, the Russian
| imperial yacht, was in the harbor await
ing their Guminp. and at 7 o'clock ttiis
evening their majesties and their suites
went on board of her and she shortly after
started for Denmark.
Prince Henry and Princess Irene went
to the wharf with their majesties assd
there bade them farewell. As the imperial
couple boarded the Polar Star the war
ships in the harbor fired saiu'.es and their
crews cheered them.
REBELLION IN THE PHILIPPINES.
ft Is Spreading and the Condition of
Affairs Is More Serious Than Spam
Will Admit.
LONDON. Eng.. Sept. B.â The Times to-
! morrow will publish a dispatch from
Singapore savins that the rebellion in the
Philippine Islands against Spain is spread
i ing and that the condition of affairs is
more serious than the Spanish oilieials
will admit.
MADRID. Spain, Sept. 8. A special dis-
patch from Hongkong to the Imnarcial
says that the commander of ttie British
ganboat has telegraphed from ManLaihat
the gravity of the situation at the capital
of the Philippine Islands is such as to
oblige him to remain there with bis ship.
This message indicates that the position
at Manila is very serious, though no de
tails are obtainable, owing to the rigor of
the censorship. Business telegrams have
been received at Hongkong from mercan
tile correspondents at Manila advising
against the shipment of further consign
ments of goods to the Philippines and
stating that business there is at a com
plete standstill.
The official advices from Manila say
that the rebellion in the Philippine
Islands is confined to the province of
Cavite. The rebels have barricaded them
selves in a church at Cavite, which is so
far from the shore that the Spanish gun
boats are unable to reacii it with their
guns.

sky, an electrician, has discovered an
improvement in the telephone by the use
of which distance has no effect upon the
hearing. In a recent experiment between
Rostoff and Moscow, a distance of 890
miles, talking, music and singing were
heard with perfect distinctness. For the
purpose of this experiment an ordinary
telegraph wire was used. The dispatch
adds that M. Kildischewsky will go to
London to experiment with his improve
ment on the Atlantic cables between Lon
don and New York.

RALLY OF THE WRITERS
AT CANTON.
Whitelaw Reid and Charles Em
ory Smith Sound the Slogan
of the Campaign.
MOLDERS OF OPINION CALL
UPON M'KINLEY.
Encouraged in Their Good Work by
the Standard-Bearer of
the Party.
CANTON. Ohio, Sept. B.â The Republi
can Editorial Association of Ohio metjin the
Eifcs' Hall at 10:30 o'clock this morning.
The venerable John Hopley of Bucyrus
presided. Canton was tixed upon as the
â *Â«ting place of the association for the
reason that it is the home of the Presiden
tial candidate supported by the editors of
the association and in order that a formal
call might be made upon him. About
two-thirds of the Republican editors of
Ohio were present.
When it was announced by Colonel
Brown, president of the association, that
be had a letter from Whitelaw Reid of the
New York Tribune there was an outburst
oi cheers. The reader was frequently in
terrnpted by applause, and at the close of
the reading Hon. J. M. Icks moved a vote
of thanks be given Mr. Reid, and it was
unanimously carried. The letter in part
was as follows:
We have had four years in clover which our
friends, the enemy, promised us in 1892. The
people are quite satisfied that they have had
enough of it. On the old lines this campaign
was already won. Then burst out the AÂ»lu\
lamites. Every uuthiniting or unscrupulous
man that was in distress and every oue tnat
was in debt and every oue that was discon
tented gathered themselves together, not unto
David, alas, but unto Altgeld. They captured
the National convention of a historic party
and degraded it and humiliated the country
by asking the American people to vote that
they would not obey the eighth command
ment Now, when a question is submitted to
a popular vote people must infer that there
are two sides to it a .d that they have a right
to vote on which everside their judgment in
clines. But there are no two sides to the
moral iaw. No man, no party, has a right to
put the eighth commandment to a popular
vote; to decide through an expression of pop
u.'ar desires at the polls whether this Nation
shall cheat Its creditors by paying its debts at
the rate of 53 cents on the dollar, aud whether
every private debtor shall be at liberty to
chÂ»at to the same extent the man who has
trusted him.
To propose such a vote and such a decision
isitse:fa crime, but having proposed it, the
plain people of the country will sustain the
great commandment by a vote which will sur
prise the men who would break it. You can
make free-silver men see from the financial
history of every nation that ever tried it that
while making more money does inflate prices
It works both ways. It raises prices for whnt
they have to buy as well as for what they have
to sell, and is apt to raise the former first and
highest. The grocer raises his figures long be
fore the day laborer can have his wages ad
vanced, and the laborer never really catches
up till the inevitable crash comes. Silver
monometalism never will and never did
cheapen the necessities of life, but it
cheapens the men. Look at Mexico and China
and India.
Next to the attack on the eighth command
ment in enormity is the attack by our oppo
nents on the constitution and courts of ihe
United States. The protest against the use of
constitutional power for ihe suppression of
riot, the proposal to pack the Supreme Court,
the attempt to destroy the validity of con
tracts â these are not mere demagogism, or
even intelligent communism; they are the
formal naturalization in the United States of
Russian anarchy.
Little better is the demand that every
thrifty, economical and prosperous citizen
shall De discriminated against and taxed, not
merely once, like other people, but twice, first
on what he has, and then on what he earns.
Let us be as considerate as you please of our
erring countrymen who have been honestly
misled, but let us indulge in no disguises as to
the unpatriotic, un-Araerican and revolu
tionary character of this whole programme.
The president of the Editorial Associa
tion was instructed to inform Whitelaw
Reid by telegraph at his camp in the
Adirondacks that a vote of thanks had
been given him.
The afternoon session was given over to
the address of Charles Emory Smith.
Tnere was a large audience assembled in
the hall. Mr. Smith was warmly greeted.
He said in part:
When Jefferson said that he would rather
have newspapers without a government than
a government without newspapers he indi
cated the vital part which newspapers play
tinder free institutions. That was 100 years
ago. A hundred years ago newspapers were
sentinels at the outposts. To-day they hold
the central citadel as leaders and exponents;
they are the very lifeblood of free discussion.
This is p re-eniinently a campaign of educa
tion. It is thus peculiarly our campaign. The
journalists are the real educators. It is true
there are great textbooks from the masters.
There is a new Adam Smith's "Weiilth of Na
tions" with American application ; a new Bun
yan's "Pilgrim's Progress," through the
e'.ough of despondency of Democracy ana up
the hill of difficulty; a new Baxter's "Saint's
Rest," under assured Republican restoration.
The other titles of these masterpieces are Wil
liam McKinley's complete political economy
of "Open Mills for Full Labor Rather Tnan
Open Mints for Free Sliver"; Benjamin Har
rison's "Satirical Reflections on Absurdities
of a Boy Orator's Idea of Independence of the
Law of Gravitation," and Thomas B. Reed's Old
Orchard "Plums of Political Phiiosopby." But
tne oM textbooks are expounded by the pro
fessors ia the classroom, and so the new text
books are edited with notes and index and
duily elucidation by the schoolmasters of jour
nalism.
We must first educate ourselves. We are al
ready grounded in right principles. But we
want more earnestness, more moral courage, a
higher sense of responbibillty, a true appreci
ation of the tremendous gravity of this
crisis. We want more real and lasting enthu
sinsin â a deeper and grander consecration to
the high mission which is before us. We must
educate me people in elemental principles.
We must educate them io understand that we
cannot have two standard^ of value any more
than two Htandards of weight or length.
Our existing standard of value is the 100
-cent gold dollar; free coinage of silver would
make our standard the 50-ceut silver dollar,
aud that is the reason it would be a crime of
repudiation, dishonor and disaster. We must
educate the people that the Government fiat
cannot make money. The Government stamp
weighs mill certifies, but does not create.
Money is of two kinds, real money and repre
sentative money. Real money has Intrisic
value equal to its face. Representative money
U a promise to redeem in real money. Tne
gold dollar is real money, because it is worth
100 cents whether coined or melted. The pa
per dollar is representative money, because it
is simply a promise to redeem in the real dol
lar; usvaiue is not in the stamp, but in the
fact thai the stamp p'.edges a real dollar be
hind it. The present silver dollar is partly
real and partly re presen tali ve. It iias 52 cents'
worth of value and 48 cents' worth of faithâ
faith thHt the Government will fulfill its Uedge
of keeping it at partly with gold. The pro
posed silver dollar under free coinage would
be neither real nor representative; it could not
say even with the paper dollar, "I know that
my redeemer liveth," for there would be no re
demption, and without redemption its value
would sink to its bullion value of tÂ»2 cents.
We want neither cheap dollars nor cheap men
nor cheap Presidents.
We must educate the people that political
independence is one thing and independence
of the laws of trade nnd nature is another.
The most puerile and grotesque i'lea even of
the boy orator Is nis repeated and pet notion
that because this country declared political
independence of Europe in 1776 it ought to
declare Â»n independent monetary standard in
1896. He teems to think that we ought to
Lave a distinct American measure of value be
cause we have a distinct American measure of
liberty. We can have American geography
because our rivers and mountains and glori
ous fields with their rich harvests are our
own; but we cannot nave an American arith
metic, because two and two do not make five
and fifty does not make a hundred in the
United States any more than in Europe. We
can have an American political economy, be
cau.se political economy is partly a matter of
conditions and our conditions are d fferent
from tiiose of Europe; but we cannot have an
American algebra, because algebra Is not an
experimental but an exact science-. In algebra
X represents the unknown quantity, and thus
it represents Bryan after the election, and not
even the X ray will be able to disclose his
scattered, his shadowy remains. This talk of
an independent measure shows a callow and
shallow mind. Do we not want commercial
relations with Europe? Do we not seek to ex
tend our trade? Then why do we not want a
common medium of exchange?
Above all and beyond all we must educate
the pcopie that National honesty and indi
vidual honesty are the best policy. Nations
anil individuals cannot close out with the
world on one transaction and quit. They
must keep up the account, and for every act of
fraud they will pay doubie the next time. We
are against the outflow of good circulation and
th<; inflow of bad citizenship. We find com
monism, revolution and anarchy no more at
tractive and no less dangerous when urged by
the rhetoric of Bryan than when enforced by
the bomb cf Altgeid or the pitchfork of Till
man. Wo must tench the unceasing lesson of
patriotism and rectitude, and must educate
the people to maintain National houor as sa
credly as they maintained the National life,
and to be no more ready in 1896 to cut in two
the standard of value which is the basis and
measure of all business security than they
were in lii6l to cut in two the Union, which is
the ba?is and measure of our National great
ru 'S and glory.
We are met at the home of the great natriot
and .statesman, the buy soldier an 1 the man
orator and leader, wno by an unerring choice
is fitly made the standard-bearer in this sec
ond mighty battle for National safety and wel
fare. Let us go from his enkindling presence
and his glowing words with fresh inspiration
and renewed strength for the campaign of ed
ucation.
Mr. Smith's address was well received.
He was frequently interrupted by ap
plause and cheering.
At the conclusion of the address the
editors adjourned for the purpose of call
ing upon Ma jo r McKinley.
It was but a short walk to Major Mc-
Kin lev's house. Upon their arrival there
the editors formed themselves in groups
about the porch. The spokesman was
John Hopley, the oldest editor in the
State. He spo&e at some length on the
political questions of the day. Major Me-
Kuiley was roundly applauded when he
stepped forward to speak. He said:
Mi. President and Gentlemen of the Repub
lican Press Association of Ohio: I have been
deeply moved by the gracious words of your
veuerable spokesman. You could not have
chosen one of your membership to give the
expression to the sentiments of your associa
tion more pleasing to me than my old and
honored friend, Mr. Hopiey, whose efforts in
behalf of the Republican oarty have been un
ceasing for more than forty years. [Applause.]
It gives me great pleasure, gentlemen, to
welcome you, one and all, to my home. Canton
just now, I judge, is a very fair newspaper town
and no newspaper writer or publisher ever
comes here who is not warmly welcomed
whether he gets what he comes for or not, and
no matter what he may say when he goes
away. [Laughter and applaus?.] I feei that I
know something of the Republican editors of
Ohio. I cannot recall a time that they have
not been laithful and friendly, nor can I forget
that in some of the closest campaigns in the
State their intelligent and unfaltering sup
port has brought victory. This year they are
more earnest, more aggressive, more thorough
and more efficient than they have ever been
before. They appreciate the overmastering
importance oi the Issues involved in the pres
ent contest and are leading, gloriously lead
ing, in the educational work which is indis
pensable to the success of the party of right
action.
Gentlemen, it is a Dost of singular honor
which you occupy to-day. I cannot remember
any period, except the war, when the Repub
lican press so signally represented National
honor and National welfare as now. [Great
applause.] It is not often given to a political
party as it is this year given to ours to stand
by ill'/ National honor and evade dishonor and
repudiatlou and disquiet. [Applause.] It is
the good fortune of the Republican party to
stand in this contest (or what is best in gov
ernment, what is patriotic in ci'.izenshlp, for
what tends to the support of the great integ
rity of the Government, its currency and
credit. It is a great strain on any party, but
the Republican party is not without trial
amidst grave responsibilities. It has per
formed supreme duty before. It has met great
trusts before. It has discharged them, too.
with wisdom, courage and fidelity, and it will
meet them now, new ones, with unfaltering
purpose to serve th c best interests of the peo
pie and of all the people. [Applanse.] For
tunately in this contest the Republican party
is not alone in its support of the Republican
candidate. Conservative men are with it. All
oi the most powerful Democratic newspapers
are behind it.
All oi them stand for patriotism and Na
tional honor. They are welcome; thrice, four
times welcome, and we owe them a debt of
gratitude for their unflinching loyalty toward
the party and to pub, ie morals. [Applause.] This
is a year, gentlemen, of political contention
without bitterness. Intelligence and patriot
ism are taking the place of passion and party
issues. Pany prejudice cuts little figure in a
crisis like this. WÂ« must not indulge in crim
ination against those who may have differed
from us in the past but who are now with us
in a patriotic effort to preserve the good faith
of the country and enforce public and private
honesty. [Applause.] We must not drive any
body out of camp, but welcome everybody in.
Our people havt always extended to ihe press
the most generoua patronage and accorded it
the greatest deference, so that the press has
grown wiih our growth and advanced with
our advancement. There are nearly as many
newspapers and periodicals published in the
United States hs in all the rest of the world
beMdes. To me the modern newspaper is so
vast and comprehensive that I can nerar con

professions. [Applause] It may be in some
parts of the world despised, it may be by the
intolerant and ignorant everywhere, but de
graded it never can be so long as it is for the
benefit of the people. Ohio has always been
prominent In the fields of journalism. That
she has been so has never been denied, and
she is entitled to no little credit for her long
years of service. I need not remind you of
them.
1 congratulate you upon the high rank of the
newspaper press In Ohio and wish ior you still
higher achievement* in your chosen work in
broader fields. You never had an opportunity
for higher usefulness than now and you never
had a better opportunity for the best use of
your best facilities than in the support of the
principles and aims of the party than in the
contest now upon us. I congratulate you
upon the work you are doing aud I appreciate
it more than I can tell you, together with the
kindness and courtesy of this call. [Applause.]
Major McKinley's engagements are
multiplying so rapidly that he has decided
not to go to Zoar this week, but will de
vote the next few dayÂ« to tn*< preparation
of speeches which he is to make on .Friday
and Saturday. Charles Emory Smith
dined with Major McKinley to-night and
will leave in the morning for Erie, Pa.,
where he is to address the league clubs.
He hopes to return to Ohio later in the
campaign and make a number of
speeches.
Mr. Smith, who has just returned from
a speaking tour in Maine, says the Repub
licans will carry that State by a phenom
enal majority.
SENATOR CARTER'S CO URNE.
Advises All Montana Republican* to
Stand by JHcKinlry.
HELENA, Mont.. Sept. B.â Senator Car
ter's statement regarding the course of
conduct he pursued as a delegate to the
St. Louis convention is published to-day
in the form of an open letter to the mem
bers of the Republican State Convention
of Montana, which the Senator says he
will be unable to attend. The Benator
lauds the Republican party for its achieve
ments, and in reciting the action of the
National Convention on the currency
question declares be was dissatisfied with
the declaration in favor of the gold stand
ard. The platform of the Chicago conven
tion, however,, is denounced as a "load
greater than silver can bear." He adds:
I do not believe In free coinage coupled with
free trade, and I do not believe both can be
successfully established and maintained by
our Government. The free-trade policy wili
render the establishment of bimetallism an
utter impossibility. After looking the whole
situation over it will be found that the Repub
lican party has not declared in favor of the
sold standard, but in favor of the restoration
of silver.
Mr. Carter regards the Republican de
claration as too conservative, but as be
tween its acceptance and that of the Chi
cago platform "With its free trade. States'
rights, free riot and other objectionable
features" the Senator finds no room to
hesitate, and urges on the Montana con
vention the placing of McKinley electors
in trie field as its duty.
He denies the richt of the delegates to
nominate Bryan electors, and advises the
silver Republicans who support Bryan to
keep their bands off the convention, while
asking the "broadest possible charity" for
them at the hands of the delegates.
In the future as in the past ihe Senator
says he will stand for protection and free
coinage, and will give McKinley his sup
port because he thinks the best interests
of tbe State and country will be subserved
by Republican victory. He advises the
State Convention to declare for iree coin
age in its platform and indorse the rest of
the National platform. In conclusion the
Senator predicts the return of the bolting
Republicans "in due sea-on."
BALLOON ON FIRE AT SEA
Thrilling Finale to a Labor-Day
Demonstration in New
Jersey.
The Airship and Its Occupants Plunged
Into Hell Gate Waters Leaving
No Trace B hind.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept B.â Several
persons on Wards Island about 6:30 o'clock
last night saw a large balloon about 800
feet in the air drifting to the southeast.
When about 300 feet south of "Nigger
Rock" the balloon was seen to be on fire.
In an instant it began to descend rapidly
and striking the water at Hell Gate sank
immediately.
Many persons who saw the balloon from
Wards Island state that there was a bas
ket attached to the balloon, and in the
dusk of the evening they saw in it what
tt.ey supposed to be a man, and from his
motions he was either throwing out ballast
or waving a flag. When the basket de
scended into the strong current of Hell
Gate the balloon settled over it and the
mass disappeared >o quickly beneath the
water that a party which put out in a boat
at once could find no trace of it. Those
who saw it say the balloon was burning
when it struck the water.
The men on Wards Island believe that
the balloonist was unable to extricate him
self and was drowned. A steam launch,
wnich was passing at the time, kept up a
constant whistling, and it was thought
that the balloonist had been picked up by
the craft, although those familiar with
the currents in this part of the river
â¢ay that this was almost impossi
ble. The man could scarcely live a
minute in the water near Nigger
Rock in the flood tide, no matter
how powerful a swimmer he might be.
The current was so swift that no one
could make headway against it. They say
it would undoubtedly throw a swimmer
against the sharp rocks with so mach
force that it would stun him. If he es
caped the rocks he would be borne up the
stream and his chances of making the
shore would be srcall.
The balloon was of the kind ordinarily
used in making ascensions for a display.
It came from the northwest and probably
was sent up at some Labor day celebration
in New Jersey.
The. police are confident that the aero
naut was drowned, and the work of drag
ging for the body will be begun this morn
ing. Several places up the sound were
telegraphed to last night, but at none was
there a report of a steam launch coming
in with a man rescued from drowning.

BY INDIANS
Horrible Fate of a Curio
Hunter in Oregon
Forests.
PUT TO DEATH BY SLOW
TORTURE.
Desecration of Burial Grounds
Avenged by Northern
Redskins,
JAMES HARTLEY'S MANGLED
BODY FOUND.
The Victim Spitted on a Hazel Stake
as He Lay Bound in a
Canoe.
PORTLAND. Ob., Sept. B.â Two miners
who have been prospecting in the region
of Mount Hood arrived in Portland to-day
ar.d reported that the Dody of James
Hartley, a collector of Indian relics and
curios, was found last Thursday by Henry
Peterson, a timber cruiser, on a small
island in Dead Mans Lake in the dense
forest which stretches from Mount St.
Helens to the Columbia River. The con
dition of the body, which was found in an
old canoe, the hands and feet bound by
withes of hazel and fastened to the stem
and stern of the canoe, with a stake of
hazel driven through the corpse just be
low the breast bone, showed conclusively
that Hartley had been put to death with
cruel tortures, such as were inflicted upon
white men taken prisoners by Indians in
the early history of this country.
Hartley tias been missing for over a
year, but the body was in a comparatively
good state of preservation and was readily
recognized by the clothes of peculiar
green ish-colored corduroy which he in
variably, wore and by letters and papers
foui.d in his pocket. Some such dreadful
ending had often been predicted for him,
as be had been for years engaged in col*
lectinc Indian relics and curios and had
probably robbed more Indian craves and
scattered broadcast the remains of more
redskins than any other man.
There is scarcely an Indian burying
ground on the Columbia River or the
islands therein, or along the coast of Ore
gon, where such places are numerous,
wnich Hartley had not ransacked in
search of stone knives and hammers,
beads, flint arrowheads and other articles
which Indians bury wiih their dead; and
in several places, notably at Long Island,
in the Upper Columbia, deadhouses of
modern construction were torn down by
him and the only partially decayed bodies
of tuose buried there drageed out and
thrown about to bleach in the sun and
wind in his search for any articles which
might have been buried with them.
It was the custom of nearly all the
tribes of Indians in Oregon to dispose of
their dead by placing the body in a canoe,
with the most prized effects of the de
ceased, and then inverting another canoe
over it. This made the burial places very
easy to be discovered and very easy to be
robbed.
Since the Indians have been removed to
eserv ations, in most cases far from the
burying grounds of their ancestors, such
men as Hartley Dave plied their horrible
business without much fear of being dis
turbed. Hartley had been so Jong and so
actively engaged in the business, and his
operations had extended over such a scope
of territory, that he was known by reputa
tion at least to many Indians, and when
ever it was known that he was in any part
of the country Indians from that section
sent out guards to protect their old bury
ing places.
Borne two years ago, while he was oper
ating in an extensive Indian burying
ground at the mouth of the Alsea River,
he was shot at and narrowly escaped being
captured by guards sent down from the
Siletz Reservation to keep watch for him,
the Indians having learned that he was on
his way to ti;at place. Another time,
when collecting Indian skulls at a burial
place on Little Memaloose Island, in the
rapids at the foot of The Dalles, he nar
nowly escaped beiug captured through the
canoe of his pursuers having been upset by
their over-eagerness to catch him.
Owing to dread of Indians he had for
some time kept his movements as secret as
possible, and so his disappearance at
tracted no attention until some six months
ago, when his brother came out from the
East to inquire about him. When last his
brother had heard about him he w*s col
lecting Indian curios along the banks of
the Cowlitz River, where there were many
Indian villages in early days, and where
thousands of Indians from the interior
gathered during the spring and summer
to put up smoked salmon for winter use.
He had written to his brother that he in
tended to go to some islands in Silver
Lake, over toward Mount St. Helens, to
examine an old Indian burying-ground
there, and that was the last that was
known of his whereabouts, riis brother
visited the islands in Silver Lake and
found scattered remains of Indians and
canoes, and here all traces of him ended.
It teems probable that he learned of the
bury ing-ground on tue island in Dead
Mans Lake, some twenty miles farther in
the forest, where, tradition cays, the chiefs
and medicine men of several tribes along
the Columbia are buried, and, lured by the
prospect of a rich rind of curios, he
ventured to visit the place, imagining
that he would be safe from molestation in
the depths of that great forest. The
Indian guards evidently caught him ana
put him to a cruel death, and his fate
might never have been known had not the
timber-cruiser Peterson been led by
curiosity to visit this island.
Hartley's brother, who returned East
several weeks ago, has been notified of the
discovery of the remains, and will prob
ably come out here again to take them
home.

NEW YORK, N. V., Bept. 8. â A Her
ald special irom Danvers, Mass., says:
Despite the repeated denial by the Right
Hon. Joseph Chamberlain that he was to
have an official conference with Secretary
Olney regarding th* Venezuelan question
the rumor continues to be circulated.
Chamberlain declared yesterday in the
most emphatic terms that there was not a
shred of truth in the rumor.
"I have no expectations," said he, "of
meeting Olney during my present visit to
this country. There was never any foun
dation for the story that we were to have
an official conference. I have no authority

THE KILLING WAS JUSTIFIABLE.
Result of an Inquiry Into a Case Where
an Officer Orders a Mutinous Sol
dier to Be Shot.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. B.â A Tribune
epecial from Washington says: The War
Department has made public the proceed
ings of the court of inquiry recently con
vened in tne Department of the Platie to
examine into the circumstances of the
killing of a private in Company C in pur
suance of an on'.er from a commissioned
officer to a soldier who stxot the private.
The car,e has attracted considerable at
tention among the officers of the army
owing to the question involved of the
right of an officer to order a man under
his command to shoot a comrade in time
of peace. In several cases in the West
civil courts have uphejd the shooting of
soidiers u.idcr certain conditions, but the
case here reic-rred to differs from those
previously decided in many respects.
The officer who ordered the shooting is
First Lieutenant W. O. Clark of the
Twelfth Infantry. The circumstances
were thes-: A private of the Tweitth In
fantry named Weaver assaulted First
Sergeant Livingston of the same regi
ment. In the course of the scrimmage
which took place Weaver broke loose
from the sergeant and running to a gun
case in the guardroom picked up a musket
and fired at ihe non-commissioned officer.
The shot killed him.
After killing Sergeant Livingston
Weaver assumed a threatening attitude
towarii otlier soldiers standing by. Among
the witnesses of the killing was" Lieuten
ant Clark. Fearing that Weaver would
fire again he ordered Private Btrine to
shoot to kill Weaver. Tnis Strine did,
Weaver falling dead. The court of in
quiry, after investigating all the facts,
found that the shooting of Weaver by
Strine was proper and necessary and the
action of Lieutenant Clark in the case was
justifiable.
A VERY CANELEAN LOVER.
Drops a Letter from His Pocket Which
Jropnrttizes Him Life.
NEW YORK. N. V., Sept. B.â A Sun
special from Dublin, Ga., says. Mrs. Fan
nie Twiggs is the young and beautiful wife
of Judge H. D. Twiggs. Her name has
been involved with that of George M.
Brinson, a wealthy real estate owner in
Emanuel County.
Brinson and Mrs. Twigga have been In
correspondence with each other for sev
eral weeks. Sunday Brinson visited Col
lins,a small station on the Georgia and Ala
bama railroad. He remained until even
ing. On going to the station to leave
town he pulled his handkerchief from his
coat pocket and a letter dropped to the
ground. Some men picked it up and be
fore tuey could return it to the owner the
train left.
The men read the missive. It was from
Mrs. Twiggs, inviting Brinson to go on a
pleasure trip to Tybee Island, a summer
resort near Savannah, and also asked him
to bring alon^ a friend, as she had a young
woman friend who would accompany her.
The letter was mai.ed to Judge Twiggs.
He was very angry on reading it and a
seenÂ» ensued when he confronted his wife.
He then sent a challenge for a duel to
Brinson and requeued an immediate re
ply. Brinson studied the situation and
ilecid-d not to accept the challenge. Judge
Twiggs then sent him word that he would
kill dim on sight. The matter stands in
this way at present.
ON DEL MONTE COURTS
California Tennis Players in
Competition Beiore the
Nets.
Whitney Brothers and Hardy and
Driscoil to Meet in the
Finals.
DEL MONTE, Cal., Sept. B.â The an
imal tennis championship tournament be-
gan at Del Monte this morning with ten
teams on hand to play, and quite an as
semblage of spectators, most of whom
were guests at the hotel or people from
Pacific GroTe. The conrts were in fine
condition, and when the umpire called
play at 10 o'clock sharp the onlookers
* ere treated to an exhibition of hign-class
tennis.
The teams first at work were Van Wyck
and Captain O. C. Berryman of the United
States steamship Oregon and the Whitney
brother-s. The Whitney brothers won.
Score : 7-6. 6-3, 6-2.
The next match to attract attention was ;
the one between Jones and Harper, the !
Monterey County champions, and Nichol- i
son and Gage of Oakian.l. This match,
although not as high grade as some of the '
others played during the day, attracted
much interest from the fact that tnere was
a desire to see tiow the local men would I
play against the city c-acks. After three
hard pets the Monterey team came out
victorious, and was heartily congratulated.
Score : 6-3 6-4. 6-4.
The Whitney brothers now played Eck
art and Uphnm. and after a lively match
won by 6â3, 6âl, 4â6, 6â3. Eekart's
swift service netted his team many aces at
critical momenrs.
Dripcoll and Hardy tired out the Mon
terey players, and although the latter
played well at times they were not able io
handle Driscoli's drives and Hardy's
smashes. The score was 6â3,6 â 3, 6â4,6 â 4, 6â4.6 â 4.
Tne most exciting match of the day was
that between Harry Weihl and Charles
Suydani, and Drs. Decker and Roth
g:niKer of the United States navy. The
latter, although much stronger and
more agile than their opponents,
lacked their skill and excellent
judgment. The sets were close and
the play was fast from beginning to end.
Harry Weihl was here, there and every
where at the same time, playing a game
which promises much for future events.
Weihl and Suydum finally won, the ?core
being 6-3, 6â o, 7-5.
Dr. Root and Mr. Findlay. the latter of
Monttrey, put up quite a game against
Pratt anu Spencer, and won, 6â3,6 â 3, 4â6,4 â 6,
7â5. They were in turn defeated by the
Whitneys, 6âl, 6â2. 6âo.
Quite an ovation met Weihl and Suydam
as they stepped into ihe central court to try
conclusions with the O.tkland cracks.
Hardy an 1 Driscoil. As these teams are
from rival sections, it was hoped by the
San Francisco contingent that their rep
resentatives wou d win, and then the
finals would be in the club. Driscoil and
Hardy upset all their calculations by win
ning in straight sets. At one time, how
ever, the pony team was within a point of
winning the second set. The score was6 â 4,
7â5, 6â3. This leaves Whitney and
Whitney and Hardy and Driscoil to play
off in the finals to-morrow.

A CRAZY COACHMAN'S DEED.
Kills a Guest of the Family in Which He
Is Employed and Ends His
Own Existence.
ALLENDALE, N. J., Sept. B.â A shock
ing double tragf dy aroused great excite
ment here 10-day. Isaac Caryle of New
York City, while a guest at the country
residence of the family of the late Civil
Justice Wandell, was shot down in cold
blood by William Doling, who had been a
coachman in the service of the family for
nineteen years. After murdering Caryle
the coachman attempted to kill Frank
Wandell, and failing in this turned the
weapon upon himself and sent a bullet
through his own heart.
The Wandells and the Caryles have
been on intimate terms for many years.
The Wandells are very wealthy, owning
much property in the vicinity of Eighty
third street and Lexington avenue, New
York. The family consists of mother, two
sons and two grown daughters.
The Caryle family consisted of Isaac B.
Caryle, the father, his wife and two sons.
Caryle is a retired real estate dealer and
the murdered man, who was 38 years old,
yvas his youngest son. The latter had
just arrived and while walking through
the grounds with Frank Wandell met the
coachman, who in return for a pleasant
greeting discharged the contents of a shot
gun at him, killing him instantly.
Wandell fled before tbe coachman
could reload and the latter then turned
the gnn on himself. No suspicious ac
tions had been detected on the part of
the coachman, but it is thought that he
became suddenly insane and seeing
Caryle, who was supposed to be one of
his best friends, he determined to kill
him.

FEEE TURNPIKES DEMANDED.
Fifty Participants in Some Rather
High-Handed Proceedings to Bs
Lodged in Jail.
SPRINGFIELD, Ky., Sept. B.â The de
mand for free turnpikes in Washington
County has developed a mob which may
have to be quelled by State troops. Yes
terday the Sheriff went out in the country
to arrest the men who shot Tollgate
Keeper Wells Saturday night and riddled
his house with bullets. The men, who
numbered over fifty, defied the authori
ties and threatened to burn the town of
Springfield if an attempt was made to
arrest them.
Yesterday at dusk the Sheriff arrested
Joe Settle, a member of the mob, and
brought him in to jail at midnight. In
the meantime, however, the man's friends
got wind of the affair and moved on
Springfield, appaiently to put the threat
to burn the town into execution.
The arrest occurred at 6 o'clock, and st
8 o'clock the large tobacco warehouse of
P. W. McLaughlin, within a square of the
courthouse, was in Humes.
The people, remembering the threat,
thought it was being executed, and in a
few moments the streets were alive with
men armed to the teeth and determined
to give the incendiaries a warm reception
if they attempted any further outrage.
To-day business practically suspended
and every man is armed. The names of
some nfty participants in the outrages
are known, and the Sheriff has organized
a posse to capture them.

Committee.
LAVISH PROMISES ARE MADE.
At the Same Time tbe Stand of tbe
People's Party in the Past Is
Praised.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. B.â The
following address to "every American pa
triot" has been issued from the headquar
ters of the National People's party. In
full it reads :
To Every American Patriot: The People's
party, as its name implies, ia the champion of
tbe masses who labor and produce wealth. It
was summoned into existence by an indus
trial conterence that represented the products
of the Nation. When It sprang Into tne politi
cal arena it was the only party demanding the
enactment of laws for the suppression of
monopolies and for the equal protection of all
citizens against the encroachments of corpor
ate power. It is now the only party in exist
ence which with undivided membership is de
manding equal rights to all and special privi
leges to none. To the efforts of this party is
due the revolt of the masses of the Democratic
party, which resulted In turning down the
Cleveland administration and its British
financial policy and the nomination of W. J.
Bryan on a platform demanding financial in
dependence for the United States. The pluto
cratic elements that heretofore dominated
Democratic conventions and dictated nomina
tions are now vigorously resenting the action
ol the Chicago convention, which they con
sider an unwarranted interference on the part
of the voters.
They have organized, and are now to open
the campaign as aggressive allies of the gold
Republicans, and with their money and votes
will do everything in their power to defeat the
will of the people by the election of McKinley,
tbe Republican candidate, whose nomination
was dictated by and whose administration is
mortgaged to a combination of American and
English monopolists and plutocrats.
The mission of the People's party is to re
store the Government to the people. To thiÃ
end it has nominated Mr. Bryan for President
and Mr. Watson for V ice-President, which is
not only the true co-operative ticket for silver*
voters of all parties to unite upon, but which
is also the best silver ticket in the field. Our
friends must not abate one jot or tittle of their
interest or efforts to advocate the principles of
the People's party because another party has
been forced to adopt nearly all of our princi
ciples. It must be remembered that control of
tbe National Democratic party was obtained
by the silver men of that party only through a
bitter contest in each State â a contest, how
ever, which was forced upon the party and its
leaders by the existence and rigid growth of
the People's party.
Had it not been for the People's party each
one of the old parties would this year have
been running a gold bug for President, as they
have in each campaign for the last twenty
years. The People's party has made this
political revolution possible, and its continued
existence and growth are necessary to secure
reforms for which the Populists and silver
Democrats are alike contending in this
campaign.
It must be also remembered that there is now
a considerable majority in the Democratic
party who, though supporting the action of the
Chicago convention, do so from policy, and
behind their present position is lurking "many
a doubt and mental reservation. That these
doubts and mental reservations may yet re
enforce the bolting plutocrats of the Indian
apolis convention and render the action of th*
Democratic party uncertain in the future are
possibilities to be discounted, and the People's
party is the only agency through wliich the
people can do this.
Therefore it is the Interest and duty of
every good citizen who believes in a govern
ment as administered by Jefferson, Jackson
and Lincoln to upbuild and strengthen this
National organization, which has made re
form and reiiei possible in this campaign.
To have a government of the people the
people must have a party that is true to them
through which to obtain such a government.
This they Cannot have if the National party
draws its campaign funds from bankers and
corporations. The National committee of a
party exercises great influence in the selection
of National officers, from l'resident of the
United States down to the village postmaster.
Whenever a National committee, through
some secret and unsten agency, collects large
sums of campaign funds, then it is sure that
that party is mortgaged to those who con
tribute such funds. In fact, such a party is
Bure to pass laws giving to the monopolists
and trusts who furnish these campaign funds
special privileges that will enable them to levy
tribute upon tbe people. When contributions
to campaign funds come from *uch sources
they do not come as a gift, but as an invest
ment, upon which they expect a return of a
hundred fold. If this were not so the trusts
and monopolists would not throw their money
away in campaigns; therefore the people
must contribute iunds for some political
party during the campaign in order to have
that party to guard tneir interests after elec
tion.
If the People's partr is placed in power it
will serve the peopie: and vo be left free to do
this your National Committee cannot and will
not accept contributions from the monopolists
who seek special laws to enable them to prey
upon ihe people.
The People's party proceeds from the peo
ple and is of the pt- opie, and must receive its
Eupport from the people direct in tiie form of
small contriDutions from the individual voter.
Such small contributions from the individual
voter of any party will furnish an abundant
campaign fund lor all legitimate purposes
and enable the party receiving it tosuccess
lully compete with any corrupt organization
of bankers, corporations and venal politi
cians.
Therefore in behalf .-of the people of the
United States, who produce wealth and pay
taxes, the People's party National Committee
appeals to all who are able and willing to do
so to contribute the sum of $1 to our National
campaign fund.
A prompt response is urgently requested to
enable us to prosecute a vigorous campaign in
defense of our homes and liberties, that are
menaced by a combined plutocracyâ the
Kothschild- Morgan-Han na-McKinley Combi
nation fighting us in iront, and the Roths
child-Morgan-Cieveland-Paimer combination
fighting us in the rear.
Four years more of gold standard and
monopoly rule, with falling prices and shrink
ing values, and thousandsof mortgaged homes
will be lost and thousands more of our laborers
will be without employment. Plutocracy is
desperate and 1* determined to have a Presi
dent and Congressof lv own, that will increase
and use the army to suppress bread riots while
gold grows dearer and human life grows
cheafer. ,
Your National Committee is doing the best
it can against a rich and powerful combina
tion. For us to stand any hope of winning
you must uphold us. If we could have but 1
cent for every $10 used by the enemy we could
carry on a vigorous campaign that would
mean tbeir defeat.
This is your fight. It is our fight. Hold up
our hands and we will do our duty in the ter
rible struggle. Don't wait for somebody elÂ»e
to move . What is everybody's business is no
body's business. Make this your business. At
once see several of your neighbors; try to get
them to contribute at least $1.
If some cannot do this then get eacn to give
as much as he can. In short, take up a sub
scription in your community at once end for
ward the amount, with tne names of the con
tributors, to Hon. M. C. Rankin, Terre Iluute,
Ind., our National treasurer. Also at the same
time notify your National chairman at Wash
ington, I>. C, of tbe amount thus forwarded.
There is no time to lose. It is now only eight
week* until the battle will be y, on or lost. Be
the first in your community to forward a nub
â crlption. We must win this fight. Let each
do his duty and victory await.* ns.

McKINLEY RALLY
AT PALO ALTO
Stanford Students Cheer
for the Republican
Leader.
SPEECHES BY CLASSMEN
University Orators Denounce the
Policy Fathered by
Bryan.
BRAINY YOUNG MEN IK LINE.
No One Fonnd at the Institution to
Organize a Democratic
Club.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal,, Sept.
B.â Tbe Republicans held an enthusiastic
meeting heie last evening, and for two
hours the quadrangle resounded with
yells for the Republican candidate for
President. Four hundred students turned
out to listen to the speeches, all by stu
dents of the university. The meeting was
held under the auspices of the McKinley
Club, which numbers several hundred
members now. The Democrats had a
club, but its officers have become Repub
licans during the past summer, aud as yet
there has been no one to call a meeting.
The Republican rally was the first of a
series to be held during the campaign.
The meeting was called to order by Mr.
Switzer '9S, president of the club, wbo
made a brief but ringing address on the
need of organization among tbe students
to advance the cause of McKinley and
prosperity. He introduced Sheldon '96,
formerly a Democrat and an oilicer of tho
Democratic Club here. Sheldon was one
of the Stanford intercollegiate debaters in
the last debate with Berkeley, and his con
version to the cause of sound money is
considered quite a circumstance here.
Sheldon made one of the best speeches
of the evening. He mentioned briefly tbe
dancers of the proposed Democratic mea
sure and policy and the disaster likely to
result to tbe commercial interests of the
country from tbeir adoption. He advised no
one to cast a vote for tne gold nominees â
Palmer and Buckner â on the ground that
it would be a vote thrown away. A Demo
crat in favor of sound money must vote
for McKinley, he said, for he weakened
tbe great cause he believed iv should be
cast a vote for Palmer.
Sheldon emphasized the fact that inter
national bimetalism was the only sort of
bimetallism that would be practicable,
and showed bow intimately the policy of
this country was bound up in that of other
nations.
Ross, also an intercollegiate debater,
made a lucid statement of the issues at
stake. His speech was roundly cheered.
Among others who addressed the meet
ing were Squires '97 of Nebraska, who
believes his State will go Republican,
Lake '97 and Kinney '00.
EDDY TALKS AT SALINAS.
J'rotpeetire Beet- Growers Shown the Ben
efits of Protection.
SALINAS, Cal., Sept. 8. â The political
campaign in Monterey County for 1896 was
opened in Salinas this evening with a
rousing gathering of Republicans from all
portions of the county. Hon. J. R. Heb
bron presided. The new opera-house was
filled from gallery to proscenium arch.
The speaker of the evening was Hon. T. V.
Eddy of Minnesota. Not at any time
caring his two hours' speech did the audi
ence lose interest in his arguments.
Eddy discussed the 16 to 1 question, and
proved that the Republican party has
been the only true friend of Â«ilver. His
handling of the real issue, protection,
brought forth cheer after cheer from the
audience, showing that the old Republi
can doctrine still arouses more enthusiasm
than does any other issue. His mention
of McKinley 'b name was received with an
outburst of applause. He showed the Dem
ocratic voter how much more benelit he
would receive under a tariff that would
bring $1 per ton here to the beet-grower
than under Democratic policy. This struck
home. Every beet-grower is anxious to
get as much for his beets as possible, and
many Democratic voters who iutend to
raise sugar-beets for the mammoth fac
tory to be located here prefer a tariff that
will yield them from |10 tT $20 per acre
more than the legislation advocated by
Bryan.
LOS ANGELES CUMRING.
Secret Agreement Between Populists and
llentocrata.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. B.â a
joint meeting of the co-executive commit
tees of the Democratic and Populist par
ties here, an agreement is said to have
been entered into secretly, whereby a
fusion is to be effected between the par
ties at interest, looking to joint tickets on
candidates for Superior Jndgeships, the
Legislature and Supervisors. The plan is
that the Populists are to have tour out of
six of the Assembly candidates, two out
of four candidates for Superior Judges

dates, while the Democrats are to name
the candidate for the State Senate.
This scheme is said to be in furtherance
of the White-Cator combine to control the
election of United States Senator next
winter and two years hence. The move
will meet- with tremendous opposition in
both Democratic â  and Populist conven
tions, which meet here next Monday, and
it is now believed that fusion will be de
feated.

and Wear were the unanimous choice of
the party at its recent county convention.

is done tor the purpose of forming a
fusion between the Democrats and Popu
lists. It is rumored that the Populist can
didate for Judge and Assernblymau will
also resign to aid the scheme. A confer
ence of the two parties regarding the mat
ter is announced for Thursday morning.
â Mcl.achlan at Santa Ynese.
LOS OLIVOS, Cal., Sept. B.â The Re
publican campaign was opened in the
Santa Ynez Valley last night by tbe Hon.
James McLachlan at Santa Yncz. Mc-
Lachlan spoke to a large and attentive
audience, and his exposition of the falla
cies ana impractabilities of free silver, as
advocated by Bryan & Company, was a
revelation to many who imagined they
understood the proposition. The speaker
used argument unanswerable, supported
by facts and figures, in favor of the real
issueâ protection. The meetins closed
witn cheers for McKinley and HoDart.

discussing politics to-day said: "Bimet
allism by the United States aione would
cause great ldss to your country, but free
coinaee, which is virtually the adoption
of the silver standard, would be much
worse. I am not surprised at the with
drawal of capital from this country under
present conditions."

STANFORD'S CLASS-RUSH
Freshmen Defeat Sophomores
in the First Clash of
the Year.
Newcomers Take Many Prisoners in
an Exciting Contest for
Supremacy.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept.
9. â The first class rush of the year came
off to-day, and as a result the "nitty-nits"
are walking around with their heads high
in the air, for the sophomores were downed
in an efficient manner, notwithstanding
their organization and pluck. Fully sixty
men had been organized by sophomores,
who elected Rollie Wilbur '99, tbe shot
putter, as their captain, and Freeman, the
tennis champion, as first lieutenant. The
who c number was divided up into squads
of three or four men each, and all were
provided with rope. Last evening they
donned their rushing clothes and marched
about tbe campus and the men's dormi
tory shouting their battle cry:
'Rah, 'Bah, 'Rah,
Sis boom ah;
'99, '99,
Ha. Ha. Ha.
But the freshmen were hot to be taken
in in that manner and so avoided the rush,
but notified the "sophs" that they would
be on deck this afternoonâ and they were
with a vengeance. Everybody knew that
a rush was to occur and the chief subject
of conversation curing the lunch-hour waÂ«
how it would result. It was well known
that the fresbmen had more large men
than the sophomores and that they were
greater in numbers, but experience and
organization were all on the aide of the
sophomores.
Shortly after the lunch-hour the fresh
men prepared to march uporf the sopho
mores, who were believed to be ensconced
behind the big museum. Tbe news came
then that the "sophs" had been making
hay while the sun shone and had captured
all the freshmen as they came up from
Palo Alto; that these men. to the number
of fifteen, had been sent off in a bus to
Redwood City, five miles away.
A scramble over the field to the Palo
Alto road was made by the seventy or
more freshmen and here they met in bat
tie. It was a sight to be remembered.
Neatly dressed co-eds were on hand in
plenty, but they evidently oared less for
their unfortunate brothers than did the
Berkeley uirls. There was no administer
ing to the wants of the wounded. Upper
classmen were on in plenty, and those
who steered clear of rushes when their
own class rushing days were on seemed to
be more prominent than ever in advising
tbe combatants.
Both sides were dressed for tbe occasion
in tbe oldest, most tattered garments pro
curable.
The scrap was fast and furious; at first
one aide seemed to have an advantage
and then the other. Men would sway
backward and forward in their wrestling-,
roll in the dust till they were as black aa
coal beaver?, tie each other up as fast as
possible and ti.en be carted off to the re
spective piles of prisoners, perhaps to get
loose and do it all over again until they
were utterly exhausted. The fight lasted
forty minutes and culminated in tbe
carting away by tbe freshmen of all their
prisoners to neighboring points, tbe pris
oners being dropped off along the road to
make their way back as fast as they could.
The yeil of the 1900 classmen changed
from
Rah, Kan, Ru,
Rah, Rah. Ree,
Nineteen Hundred,
Ceuiury,
n
Rah, Rah, Ru,
Rah, R.ih, Ree,
Nineteen Hundred,
Victory.
And the class rush of the year was over.

JUDGES HISSED
AT SACRAMENTO
State Fair Crowds Resent
a Seemingly Unjust
Decision.
TWILIGHT SET BACK.
Disqualified for Breaking A/ter
Winning Three Heats in
a Trot.
PKINCE GIFT EEATS EUNYADI
Easily Captures the Three-Year-Old
Sta.keâ Betty G?ntry Takes a
Purse.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. B.â A
shower of hisses from tbe grand stand and
betting-ring greeted a decision, seemingly
as unjust as it was technical, rendered by
the judges at the track to-day. Laurel,
driven by Keating, was a barred favorite
in the betting before the 2:24 trot, but
what caused her to repeatedly break in
the three heats following tbe first, which
siie bad taken in a jog. will probably for
ever remain a conundrum. Twilignt,
owned and driven by. the old veteran,
Dennis Gannon, took the second, third
and fourth heats, aud was enthusiastically
cheered, as every one supposed that a
purse had fallen where it was most
needed. During the supposed deciding
beat the mare made two very slight
breaks, and forty yards from the wire,
owing to tbe nervousness of tbe driver,
left ber feet and ran under the wire, al
though it was plain to all that the mis
take did not better her chances. But tbe
rule was fortbeoming that permits the
judges to disqualify a horse for repeatedly
breaking, and as in this particular case
tbree times was considereded "repeat
edly," Twilight was placed last and tbe
beat given to Niece.
The attendance was good, but the bet
ting was very light. No doubt this could
in part be Dlamed to the poor card, which
was far below mediocrity. Prince Gift,
Laurel and Betty Gentry were the mooey
winners.
There were but two starters in the three
year-old ntake, valued at $550. Hunyadi
at one time ruled favorite, but the betting
shifted in favor of Prince Gift, who was a
Ito 3 choice in the books when the pair
were called. The Prince won as he pleased
in straight heats, Hunyadi never being
able to get near him.
Six scored up in the 2:24 trot. With
Laurel barred, Addisnn sold choice at $10,
the field bringing $7 and Harry Win
chester $4. Laurel took the opening heat
easily in 2:20, with Addison second. Then
she began acting crazily, and would finish
any place but close up at the end. After
Twilight bad taken two heats and was de
prived of the third. Laurel went out and
stepped two very pretty beats, taking the
purse. . The books laid 25 to 1 against the
field defeating Laurel in the first heat won
by Twilight.
The last race on the card was the 2:22
pace, heat dashes. Palatine acted so
badly in scoring that she was finally left,
after having broken one bike and at
tempted the trick on a second. This left
but three starters, with Nellie B a 7 to 10
favorite. Betty Gentry, driven by W. H.
Stimson, and a 2}^ to 1 shot, took the
first and two following dashes very clev
erly in 2:16, 2:21, 2:21. In the second heat
Nellie B was distanced, but the elastic set
of rules was again drawn and she was al
lowed to start again.

IS MANHOOD
EVER LOST?
Strictly speaking, no! at least, hardly ever, except in extreme old age. What we
call "Lost Manhood" and "Nervous Exhaustion" is merely weakened power.
Underneath the ashes the fire remains aglow. It requires careful scientific treat-
ment to fan it into a bright flame of Hie and energy.

RACING AT TONELAND.
Opening of the Fall Meeting at Irving ton
Park.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. B.â The fall
meeting of the Portland Jockey Club
opened at Irvington Park to-day. Fine
weather, a fast track and an aggregation
of some 150 visiting horses from Cali
fornia, Idaho, Montana and Washington
made tbe sport attractive. Something
new to racetracks was seen in the shape of
an electric starting-gate, which was lately
planned by J. W. Cox and successfully
used at Helena. It. does away with even
a slight chance of any jockey getting an
advantage in starting, as at the post tbe
starter presses a button behind his Dack
and the gate flies up.

COLUMBUS. Ohio, Sept. 7.â The State
records for a mile and a half mile were
broken at the bicycle races held here un
der the auspices of the Orient Wheel Club
yesterday. Con Baker reduced the State
mile record from 1:58)4 to 1:57 1-5. He
made two attempts before succeeding. In
the first he was paced by a sextet, but the
riders were unfamiliar with it and he
made tbe mile in 2:03. He started again,
paced by a triplet. This time he suc
ceeded, John Hedges of Columbus re
duced the amateur half-mile State record
of :58 to 57 3-5.

Tte crowd was most dense, as usual, j
rear the junction of Geary, Ketrnr, i
Third aad Marksi streets, cue it was large
a: other point-, asd the enthusiasm of
the spectators m fairy appreciated by ;
the men in the trocesaicn. Wagons con
taining red fira were interspersed along
tee line, which Kept xip % continuous glow
of Light. With ail the bands playing aad
the many parlors marching; with the
grand array o* Aaericaa Sigs aad Cali
fornia Republic sigs, which were dis
played by the score ; with the flittering of
fireworks and the rreat concourse cf
people assembled ca Market street, the
spectacle was certaiaiy exhilarating as I
well as pieasiaz.
Goiaz dawn Market street the special
diversion of a kicking mule was afforded
by D. J. Eitis. marshal of the third di
vision, who rode the beast. The mule
Â«ras between a band and a red-lire wagon.
Every time that it felt the spur, aid that
was quite often because of the necessity of
checking iis erratic method of moving
aooat in the procession,' it tried to kick.
First it tried to kicÂ£ Native Sons near it
at the prick of the steeL Then it tried to
kick Marshal Ellis, who was on its back.
This diversion was crovided during nearly
all the march. N.i one was hurt and
some amusement mm induced by the un
ruly animaL
The procession necessarily presented a
somewhat somber appearance, as about
all M Battfi Sens were in dark clothes,
their departure from citizens' drees being
marked chiefly by badges and regalia.
Many carried gripsacks fa the line con
taining natty uniforms of light colors.
which are expected to electrify the natives
when they are exhibited in ths rracd
parade cf all the parlors of the State at
Stockton. There were a few whit* caps
and straw hats in sight, bet these were
few. Two members of Rincon Parlor ap
peared in full uniform, acting under mis
take. Two members of Presidio Psrlor
carried la-. bundles of Japanese on
brellas* which are expected to accentuate
the airy marching of the members of that
body,
When the procession reached the foot of
Market street a great crowd was gathered,
which blocked the entrance to the ferry 50
that the police had to clear a passage lor
the various paricrs. heeded by their bands,
to pass through. On both sides of the po
lice lines the spectators pressed closely.
The Cram corps passed at the head oÂ» dm
parlors onto the Piedmont, playing ia
lively fashion, and the Native Sens, with
a fail sprinkling of Native Daughters, soon
crowded the lower deck of the boat frcm
bow to stern and occupied a large aaatc of
the cabin. The greatest amount of enthu
siasm, was manifested, some of which was
worked off in pranks by younger Native
Sons, who amused themselves by throw
ing torpedoes among the crowd.
So far the programme bad progressed
exactly as it was laid cut. Sometniag like
â M tickets had been placed for sale up
town, so that the Native Sons who marched
in the procession were already supplied
with the necessary pasteboards aad there
was no delay to sceak of at the ferry.
There were rousing cheers as the Pied
mont moved out of the slip.
la the procession on Market street were
the members of Mission Parlor, but they
did not co to the Piedmont, navine- ar
ranred to go op on the steamer T. C
Walker, on which they took their band
and made preparations for great fan en
route to Stockton, their programme in
cluding a minstrel performance. Some
thing like 300 tickets were sold for passage
on the i.earner, and as the berths num
ber less than that the rhanees that many
will pass a sleepiest night are good.
The steamers departed before the
main body of Native Sons embarked on
the Piedmont. The Airiso carried cp
Native Sons frost Santa Clara County
early in the afternoon, and Stanford Par
lor aad the Oakland Native Sons went in
two divisions at 4:30. so that altogether
large delegations had gone forward already
before the body of the parlors from this
City were fairly under way.
When the Piedmont reached the Oak
land mole the scene can be better im
agined that described. There were be
tween" 1300 and 1500 excursion:* on the
boat and they all prepared to make a rash
for good sects on the ears, and wh n the i
rasa was fairly begun the line of speeding
Native Sons extended from the boat half
oi the length of the big depot en the mote,
the imaiJieasffjtii no longer taking rank
according to the color of their regalia, out j
' being classed by leg ability alone. The [
consequence was that the membership of â¢
the parlor became scattered and the only I
solid phalanx 1 1 move sedately toward the I
train was made go almost exclusively of '
these who were too fat to maie much of a
I success at running.
The event proved that the speediest
I ones might well have spared their speed, [
I and it is by no means certain that tte j-
I lagging material for a fat man's crgaaira- [
laoa did not get the choicest aad totted j:
cushioned seats after all. The special \
train to take the Native Son* to Stockton i
was waiting on the track in two sections, I
one section being made up of day coaches 1
aad the other section consisting ex
clusively of sleepers. Some few excur
sionists went over on the 7 o'clock boat.
and they succeeded in the next heer in
getting into one ear which was opened up 'â 
for them and this they fairly filled. Bat j
all the ether cardoors were either locked
or barred by railroad employes against
the excursionists in the day-coach section. I
I The sleepers, to obtain a berth in one of!
I which involved an extra charge of I*2,
[ seemed to be open, bat the crowd bad no '
intention evidently of betnc forced Into
the sleepers. They first scormea the !
doors of the day coaches and waen they
f jund them looked and noticed over 1800 i

around in the station between the two I
sections of the train and excluded fro I

O stalwart sons c: Si* stalwart cen whose mmbj me the Tfullaari
glory,
Whose m^hty thews woo the land you own and bequeathed it yea
forever.
Whose deeds are writ for the race to read m the world's Immortal story,
And whose pale brows from thw deathless wreaths no moral bands
shall sever!
O stalwart sons of a race of kings,
Accept the song as old sum sings.
There Â» no land in the whole wide world Eke this great land of oars.
Beloved of men with a child's tree bye for the gifts so nobly
given;
Beloved of God, who pets His seals in the shapes of radiant flowers
Upon each inch of oar fruitful soil to make men sore of heaven.
O stalwart sens of a mighty land,
What hand so wise as a Father's hand?
The Eastland shrinks 'neatfa the fiery heat; the snow and the ice
assail her;
Her face is lashed by the tempest's whip and scarred by the
lightning's finger ;
Nor threats nor prayers of weary men against their fate avail herâ
The Fasttand treads a gloomy path whereon few sunbeams
Enger.
O stalwart sons, the EastJand bears
A heavy cross up fife's steep stairs!
Our land is free from the storm's rough breath, the hurricane gods
are sleeping;
Our seasons pass with a rhythmic step through the chain that the
days are weaving;
Oar songbirds sing with a saucy air â their mates in the East are
weeping ;
Our land is loved by the laughing sunâ the snow-decked East b
grieving.
O stalwart sons of the mighty West,
Which land, think you, of these is best?
The rough old sea on our land's soft marge its white-souied spray is
Singingâ
"What strand so fair as the Western strand?" the laughing
waves are crying;
The deep-sea birds of their Western loves in hoarser tones are
singing
As, homeward bound on the wind's great wings, they fly when
day is dying.
O stalwart sens, the birds should know.
For o'er the whole wide world they go.
Our air is sweet with the smell of herbs and fresh with the breath of
grasses;
Our fields are rich with a wealth of grain bred forth by the sun's
caresses:
The young winds dance on cur mountain tops and ring in our gloomy
passes â
They ride at will on the laughing waves or hide in the grain's
long tresses.
O stalwart sons, could the East but see
The Westiand's rich fertility!
Our girls are cast in a golden mold ; their cheeks wear the kiss of
morning;
Their Bps are tinged with a deeper red than tinges England's
roses;
They grasp the truths of the great new fife which everywhere is
#love ~" Z Go<3 â aye, the love cf â¢*^- â within their hrarts
The love of Godâ aye, the love of manâ within their hearts
O stalwart sons, our girls are good â
The type of truest womanhood.
Ye know the worth of the gift fun wellâ gift of the Father's
givingâ
And well ye know bow your sires toiled for that which ye inherit ;
And well ye know that without true work no fife is worth the living,
And God's judgment deeds well done * Death's crown alone
shall merit.
O stalwart sons, ye will not shirk
From finishing your sires work?
Then up and do while the day is yours. Work steadily and surely
To make the Banner of th; Bear defy those stars above you; "
Have faith in self, in State, in God. So men shall reap securely
In days to come great benefits, and all the work! will love you.
O stalwart sons, Love's all that's worth
Our striving for upon this earth.

FOR TICS-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
California celebrates herself.
Stockton will look to-day about as proud
as she feels.
This is free Admission day for all who
1 honor the State.
State pride and National patriotism go
1 hand in hand.
The Natives have charge of the cele
bration, but we are all in it.
The whole Union should get in and re
' joice in the' day it admitted California.
It will do the National eagle good to
watch the California bear hugging himself
with joy.
The law calls them "Equalizers," but
they pay no heed to the law when it calls
them by that name.
McKinley talks always for protection,
prosperity and good wages, and that kind
of talk means business.
The so-called landslide in Arkansas was
probably nothing more than the caving of
the election law down the bank.
It is perfectly clear that the big vote in
Arkansas was machine made, while that of
Vermont was the hand-work of the people.
There is no doubt that the Fopocrat
leaders in this State are ardent for free
silver. They are out of campaign money.
While we rejoice En the greatness of
California let us not forgot to resolve to i
promote its welfare and protect its in
dustries.
There are many things to do in theso
days, but the one thing you must do is,
visit the Mechanics' Pavilion and Bee the
home industries.
Middle-of-the-road Populists would do
well to imitate middle-of-the-road Demo
j crats and put up a ticket they can work
' for with ardor and honesty.
Senator Teller never fails to remind his
audiences that he is for protection. He is
willing to support Bryan, but he won't take
up the free- trade platform.
Bryan's speech on Labor day was the
best he has mads during the campaign
and it would seem he can talk on almost
any subject better than on politics.
Though the visitors go" to Stockton for
pleasure they should not forget to inquire
into the industries of the San Joaquin and
thus get a double profit from the trip.
Watson wastes his breath in railing at
Sewall from thÂ» safe distance of Texas.
He ought to go to Maine and challenge
his rival either to meet him in joint debate
or submit to arbitration.
The official body that reduces the assess
ments of the Southern Pacific 1 Railroad
and increases those of the people of San i
Francisco would probably smell just as
eweet if it were called a Board of Un
equalization. , , ,
The reports of the celebration of Labor
day in all parts of the Union show a
marked growth in the power and prestige
of organized labor and that is one of the
best evidences of coming prosperity that
the country can offer.
The most absurd thing in the Demo
cratic campaign iB the attempt of the
fusionists to get Kelly to come down in
the Filth District, when everybody knows
that Kelly is running simply for vindica
tion, and has got himselt fixed so he can't
come down.
One good accomplished by the gold
Democrats in nominating a ticket is the
Bavin* of the Republican party from the
possibility of a Cleveland hoodoo. Until
Palmer and Buckner were put up on a
straight gold platform, there was always a
danger that Grover would say something
in favor of McKinley.
The fact that so able a speaker as Ma
guire failed to draw an audience to hear
him speak at the State Fair on the silver
question is a proof that the people are
getting weary of the subject. It has be
come a thrice-told tale in this State and
the campaign of education on that issue
is complete to the satisfaction of the
masses.
" The Pitts burg Dispatch has issued a well
written and well-printed pamphlet bear
ing ' the title, "A Silver Symposium,"
being an analysis of the money issue and
containing vital facts on free' coinage; or
iginally embodied in a series of articles in
the Dispatch written by James F. Hudson.
The work furnishes answers to the silver !
raonumetallists, and is an important con
tribution to the sound money side of the
. campaign. j
ADMISSION DAY.
To-day we celebrate the admission of i
California as a State in the American
Union. The- celebration is to be conducted i
by the Native Sons and Daughters of the j
State. These are the children of the pio- j
neers and the argonauts. Through their
parentage they represent the stalwart I
manhood and womanhood that have made |
California what it is, and in themselves ]
they present the streneth and grace that is
to make the yet more glorious California
that is to be.
It is altogether fitting that this day
should be celebrated in California, nor
would it ill deserve a celebration through
out the Union. The admission of Califor
nia brought into the sisterhood of States a
free commonwealth, whose union with the
others made the United States an ocean
girt republic and erected on the Pacific
Coast, as well as on the Atlantic, those in
stitutions of law and liberty which consti
tute the best form of government known
to man. The new State thus admitted
was destined by its wealth of gold to be so
important a factor in maintaining the j
Government through the Civil War as to
well-nigh deserve the title of the savior of
tbe Union. Though its population was at
the time composed of almost equal num
bers from the Northern and the Southern
States, its loyalty during the war was
never doubtful. California came into the
Union to stay. She came into it to protect
it and defend it with her wealth, her
energy and the best blood of her people.
In a more important respect therefore
than attaches to the admission of any
other single State, the admission of Cali
fornia was a notable event in the history
of tbe Union as well as of the State. It
merits commemoration for all time to
come and that commemoration has been
most appropriately undertaken by the na
tive sons and daughters of the State. They
from the very fact of birth and training
within its limits feel for California a love
which perhaps not even the pioneers
can feel and which later comers do
not know. Their pride in being Califor
nians mingles with their patriotism &3
citizens of the Great Republic, and in their
celebration the festival of Admission day
unites the bear flag with the stars and
stripes in the harmony of a blended and
inseparable loyalty.
California has good reason to be proud
of her sons and daughters. In them ap
pears the best offspring of the biending of
mauy races and the assurance that the
Californian of the future will be as emi
nent for strength and grace among the
races of the earth as was the Greek of the
ancient world. Our land in soil and in
climate is more conducive to human
health and happiness than any other land
on earth. Our people represent the most
energetic and vigorous specimens of the
foremost races of mankind ana their
union in such a favored region cannot fail
to produce the highest type of manhood
the world has yet seen. Surely the youth
of the State has a right to rejoice in its
heritage and all who live in California
and love her should rejoice with them in
the celebration to-day.
In these days of theory, ivhen fancy and
folly run mad, ue calmly point to the four
years under Harrison and confidently say
that the policies of sound money and protec
tion which then prevailed with a wise and
capable President will come again to the peo
ple of this country when the policies of sound
money and protection once more prevail u-ith
another wise and capable Republican Presi
dent. â Chauncey Depew.
POPULISTS WANT MONEY.
The appeal of the managers of the Popu
list party to the rank and file for money
contributions for campaign expenses is
curiously worded. It declares to start I
with that the Populist party is the cham
pion of the masses who produce wealth by
the sweat of their brow, so to speak, and
that if the Democratic party now stands
i for or advocates a single principle having j
! the air of respectability it was driven to it
by the Populists. The address speaks of
Bryan and Watson as tbe party's candi
dates, and claims that they are the only
true exponents of the principles of Jeffer
son and other gentlemen with political
records who lived in the long ago.
The amusing part of the address is
where it is claimed that the Pooulists
forced the Democracy to turn down Cleve
land and his following. The Populist
party may have driven the Democracy
into repudiating Cleveland, but unless
history is greatly at fault the very same
Democrats who drove Cleveland out into
the cold captured the Populist National
Convention, and used its machinery to
nominate the Democracy's candidate for
President.
The address suggests that there is a good
deal of suspicion lurking in the minds of
Populists that the Democracy cannot be
trusted. It says the future of that party
is uncertain, which means that in the
matter of principles it is like the prover- I
bial flea, and that the less people have to
do with it the better it will be for them.
There iB an invitation in the address to
all believers in the doctrine of free silver !
and in the several other declarations of !
the Populist and Democratic platforms to j
join the People's party if they would i
be in good company. The proclamation
is well calculated to make Populists a
good deal more aggressive when dealing j
with Democrats, and also to make Demo
crats like Populists less than ever. The
Populist managers are not so stupid,
however, as some Democrats have sup
posed them to be. They propose to handle
their own campaign money, which is hit
ting the Democracy in its weakest spot.
In this crisis, when the National honor and
all that that involves â the business, the em
ployment and the prosperity of the country â
w at stake, the Republican party welcomes
with open arms the assistance of patriotic
Democrats who care more for their country
than for an organization which has been tem
porarily seized by the tumultuous and evanes
cent forces of revolution, of communism, of
anarchy and of repudiation. â Chauncey
Depew.
TAXES AND VALUES.
More than a year ago The Call pub
lished a table of figures showing how for
ten years the Southern Pacific had cheated i
the State of its dues by giving a wrong i
valuation of its taxable property, and The
Call also warned the public that the same
thing would be repeated this year unless
the State Board of Equalization could be
brought to a realizing sense of the fact
that the people have rights that this mer
ciless corporation ought to be made to
respect. The Call was the first to take
up arms against the unjust and unfair
assessment of railway property in the
State of California, and it does not pro
pose to quit the field until the people's
rights are recognized.
It is preposterous to say that the valua
tion of railway property in this Btate
grows less from year to year, and it is
equally absurd to say that it is at a stand
still. The State increases in population
and commerce widens and deepens in vol- \
ume from year to year, and the railway is j
not only tbe leading factor in making j
j their growth possible, but it participates !
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1896.
in a greater degree in the good results ac
cruing than any other agency. More
over, the betterments which go into a
railway improve its physical condition
and correspondingly reduce the cost of
operating trains. The value of a railway I
should be measured by its present and
prospective opportunity to earn money,
and hence its earnings should be the basis
for assessment for taxes. When the mile
age of a railway increases and its value
remains the same or decreases, it is
safe to say that it is an object of gross
favoritism, and that appears to be the case
with the Southern Pacific.
But, notwithstanding the assessment of
San Francisco is some $30,000,000 higher
than last year, and that, too, in the face of
the fact that movable property more es
pecially has decreased in volume, and
hence in value, the Board of Equalization
has, by the most arbitrary and unwar
ranted action, raised taxes in this City 20
per cent. The board did it yesterday, and
it will be a day long to be remembered by
the people of San Francisco. It is a vic
tory for the Southern Pacific over the
people; and it is a reflection upon the
good name of the Btate and a positive
damage to San Francisco to have such
methods employed by the Equalization
Board. It is the very opposite of equaliza
tion. It is putting burdens upon the
taxpayers of San Francisco that cannot be
justified by any kind of fair reasoning,
and it is all the more aggravating because
it is done to give the railways that which
in justice does not belong to them, and
what is worse, to railways that have
always exacted a full pound of flesh from
the commoner of San Francisco. The
question is, If the Southern Pacific can
saddle part of its own taxes upon San
Francisco this year and oblige her to pay
them, what guarantee is there that a
still greater burden will not be put upon
her taxpayers next year and for other
years to come?
The home market is the best frienA of the
farmer. It is his best market. It is the only
reliable market. It is his own natural mar
ket. He should be protected in its enjoyment
by wise tariff legislation, and this home mar
ket should not be permitted to be destroyed by
lessening the demand for American labor and
diminishing the pay of American workmen,
and thereby diminishing the demand for
agricultural products. â McKinley.
INCOMPETENT DEMOCRACY.
On general principles the Democratic
party should not be trusted with the ad
ministration of the affairs of the Govern
ment. The history of the country shows
that every Democratic administration did
it a great deal more harm than good, not
so much because the Democracy has no
brains, but because its theories of govern
ment have been always in opposition to the
real needs of the country. The party was
born wrong nnd out of sorts with the
spirit of the age. It never has been able
to understand that last year is not this
year. It knows that Andrew Jackson was
President of the United States, but it does
not know that he is dead. When united
in perfect harmony and Democrats every
where were of one accord the party failed
utterly to comprehend the meaning of
our system of government when given in
charge of it. To use a slang expression
the Democratic party looks well on dress
parade, but it gets rattled and spreads out
very thin when there is real work to be
done.
If, then, when the party is as one man
and is directed by the best thought, the
biggest brains and the most experienced
of its number, it fails at every point when
confronted by problems of state, what but
confusion worse confounded could be ex
pected of it when deprived of brains and
experience? This country can stand a
good deal of foolishness in high places,
and it can get along with kindergarten
rulers for a while, but as a sound business
proposition, administrations of that kind
should be very few and very far apart. We
have a Democratic administration now,
and it is admitted by friend and foe that
it and iis immediate supporters have a cor
ner on the brains, wisdom and experience
of the party, and yet a more humiliating
if not disgraceful failure at steering the
ship of state was never seen.
Now, if the greatest men of the party
are so incompetent what is to be expected
of men like Bryan, Sewall, White and Alt
geld? It would be asking too mnch of
them to give the country half as good an
administration as Buchanan did, or as
Cleveland is now giving. In fact, nothing
better than a haphazard, experimental,
try this and try that kind of a policy
should be expected of them. How could
they know what would be best and what
would be injurious to the country, except
as they guessed at it? After the country
has recovered from the mistakes of the
brains of that party and is swimming
alone in roo much of a proud and disdain
ful sort of a way it may do to elect a
Democrat, so that the people will have
something to remind them that they are
still upon the earth, but just now and for
some years to come the fewer Democrats
there are in autnority the better it will be
for the peace of mind and material inter
ests of the people.
W AGE-EARNERS TOR M'KINLEY.
Wage-earners of San Francisco are be
ginning to bo very outspoken on the polit
ical issues of the day, and like their East
ern brethren, they see no reliei from ex
isting stagnation in industrial life nor
from enforced idleness except on lines that
lead to such protection to our industries
as may be needed to overcome foreign
low-wage competition. It would be im
possible to print tbe names of the thou
sands of workingmen in San Francisco
who are taking an active part to secure
the return of prosperity by espousing the
candidacy of Major McKinley, but the
following are representative wnrkingmen
and they voice the sentiments of their fel
lows everywhere:
John Hammar, coppersmith, says: "I
am going to vole for McKinley and pro
tectiou. The general sentiment of the
masses is in favor of McKinley. Not be
cause it is McKinley, but because he Is
regarded as a man who is wedded to the
protective issue, and that is what we must
have." C. Bosthorn, tool-maker, says:
1 'Work for laboring men will come only
I under a Republican President. We must
j have him." Chris Krumbeck, teamster,
says: "I am a Republican. I have
found it the party ot prosperityâ the poor
man's friend. Democracy may be all
right for the rich man, but for the la
borer it is a good party to avoid affiliation
with."
George E. Hammond, planing-mill man,
just returned from the Northwest, says:
"You don't hear any talk about gold and
silver up there. No, sir; those men want
work. They are willing to look out for the
pay afterward. They say on all sides that
the causes of the present unfavorable con
ditions are lack of protection and the lack
of confidence in the Democratic adminis
tration." C. R. Ny, machinist, says:
"The only man to tie to, in my opinion, is
McKinley, and I am going to do it. The
Republican party can always be trusted.
Its policy is always statesmanlike. Pro
tection is the only thing that will ever re
vive the drooping industries of this coun
try." W. I. Stone, machinist, says: "X
am going to vote for McKinley. His elec
tion will mean that workingmen will see
j better times. I have worked as a machin
ist twenty years. lam fully satisfied that
protection is better than free trade for me
in every way." â¢
H. A. Mclntire, machinist, says: "Let
every workingman and every mechanic
vote for his own best good, which is for
protection for his labor." N. E. Flint, ma
chinist, says: "I will vote for McKinley
for President. There are many reasons
why I should vote for him, and I would
find it very difficult to find a reason why I
should vote against him. I do not see
how any workman can reasonably vote
against McKinley." W. S. Dennis, ma
chinist, says: "Mechanical business has
been growing steadily worse and worse,
year by year, since President Cleveland
was inaugurated. There are not half as
many machinists employed in San Fran
cisco as there were formerly. There is a
reason for this which any mechanic can
easily find. That reason is that foreign
made eoodÂ», produced at less cost than
American manufacture, have found their
way into the home market of the United
States and have taken the place of our
own products."
William Pohlmann, coppersmith, says:
"Every man I know is going to vote for
McKinley with a few exceptions. The
Republican party is identified with good
times, with plenty and prosperity. De
mocracy is a synonym for demagogy and
want." Fred Loescher, flonrmill foreman,
says: "You may put me down for a Mc-
Kiniey man. I think you will have a hard
job to find anybody else around here. We
are all for McKinley, and when I speak I
speak for nearly every man in this mill."
A. L. de Mars, blacksmith, says: "Every
one knows that work is scarce, that wages
have fallen and tnat they are still falling,
and that what we need is work, not
theories of any sort I said before that tbe
Republican policy Is safer than the Dem
ocratic policy, and every workingman
ought to see that to be tbe fact."

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
J. J. Dolan, who has been mining in Mari
posa County, at different points near Coulter
ville, lor some time past, is at the Palace. Mr.
Dolan is a tall man with dark eyes, and a beard
which is almost black. He is one of the pion
eers of California, and has mined in several
different counties.
He says Mariposa is doing some good work
at the present time in mining. He has been
developing the Virginia, in company with
some Chicago capitalists, and is now working
a force of men on the Warner.
"The Merced Gold Mining Company, which
is known in popular language as the Montana
Company," said Mr. Dolan, 'is doing the most
work there. It has about 100 men employed.
For some time past it has had a force of men

in Mariposa*
[Sketched from life by a " Call" artist]
cutting away the brush and digging ont what
has fallen in of the old ditch which was made
long ago to bring water from the Tuolumne
River.
"The idea was to bring the water through
this ditch and then take it back and turn it
Into the Tuolumne by another route. But
there appears to have been doubts as to wheth
ei or not this could be legally done, and I un
derstand few, if any, men are working on it
now. The ditch is about fifty miles long.
'â¢Three or four companies have started work
at different mines in aÂ« many different places.
The Lonlslciia mine upÂ»in the mountains is
being developed. Other properties are being
worked also. I was for a time pushing work
on the Virginia. It was a mine that had caved
in and myself and Florence King, Paul Black
mar and Ferdinand W. Peck of Chicago got a
bond on it. We hoped to clean it out, but did
not have time enough, so we quit and I have
now bonded the Warner mine, which I am now
working.
"Coulterville has about 1000 peop'e in Jt
now. There is a silver club hero and also a
McK'nley club. The latter has twice as many
members as the former. I think there ia no
doubt about Major McKinley getting a ma
jority in that section."
LADY'S WAIST.
A simple waist is shown hero. It is one of
those useful waists thai look well perfectly
plain and is yet susceptible of elaboration in
anydfess. To make a meager wardrobe seem
extensive it is appreciated by every woman,
for if made of fancy silk it may be varied in
definite.v by simple devices of ribbon, lace,
net, etc.," with slight expense. The revers of
lace are a novel iden, being a half yard in
length, simply gathered at one end. Placed at
the collar and extending toward the sleeve
they are equally attractive.
A neat and telling trimming is a piece of
ribbon eight inches long and four or five
inches wide, placed along the shoulder from
the collar and extending over tbe sleeve
This is edced with a ruffle of black net. lace or
chiffon. Fancy ribbons are most used, and a
folded collar of the same, with an immense
bow in tbe back, completes this outfit.
Fichus of net, chiffon, liberty silk, etc., are
dainty and dressy.
The waist has a fitted lining, over which the
goods is gathered both back and front.
Comment Unnecessary.

Not long ago. the San Francisco Call had a
six-column report of a meeting of the M5?"
facturers' and Producers' Association, whicn
association is organized for the purpose oi
booming home-made goods. We bad the curi
osity to go carefully over the paper for the
purpose of rinding out the number of manu
facturers' advertisements in that number.
There were none whatever. But there were
columns of advertisements of Eastern-made
goods. Comment is entirely unnecessary.
PROTECTION STILL AN ISSUE.
Omaha Bee.
Although Mr. Bryan has studiously avoided
any reference to that plank of the Republican
platform which declares for protection, and it
is the policy of the free-silver party to keeD
this question away from public attention, still
protection remains an issue, and millions of
the American people are thinking about it
j and will continue to do so. It is the opinion
I of some shrewd observers that this question
j will assume more prominence as the cam
paign advances. In any event, a very large
proportion of the voters cannot be wholly
diverted from the consideration of this ques
tion, in which are involved the ability of the
Government to meet its expenses, the security
and development of American industries and
the creation and maintenance of a market for
American labor.
Is is impossible that the millions of wage
earners whose interests and welfare are de
pendent upon industrial activity can wholly
put out of wind that policy which in the past
made the workingmen of this country the
most independent, the most prosperous and
the most contented among the world's toilers.
Protection isstillanissne with every man who
wants more work and better pay, and who has
the intelligence to understand that there is
but one way in which these can be obtained,
aud that is by restoring the industrial activity
and creating a demand for labor. Protection
is an issue with every man who desires to see
the growth of the Amerian market, so that our
producers shall be lessdependent upon foreign
markets, where they are compelled to meet
damaging competition. Protection is an issue
because it involves the future progress and
prosperity of this Republic.

MOSES ON MONEY.
The Berkeley University Frofessor Ex
plains Why We Want a Gold
Standard.
A meeting of the Political Economy
Club was held last night at 15 South Park,
the address of the evening being delivered
by Professor Bernard Moses of the Uni
verity of California. His subject was "In
ternational Exchanges and Money."
Professor Moses devoted himself to an
explanation of fundamental facts respect
ing money, quoting with approval the
definition, "Money is that which does
moneys work," and explaining that the
work of money is to effect exchanges. He
said: "We want money in trade because
of the difficulty of finding some one who
is willing to exchange the thing we want
for that we have. In an ideal money we
want divisibility, portability, sameness of
texture in all its parts, and cheapness of
keeping. We also want stability of value
with flexibility of supply. This is one
reason that fiat money is impracticable.
The supply does not vary with the needs
oi the people.
"We also want a medium of exchange
that will be accepted by other nations, so
that when one supply becomes greater
than our needs it will easily draiu away
from us, and vice versa."
At the conclusion of Professor Moses 1
address a running debate followed be
tween E. F. Adams, John McNaught, V.
L. O'Brien and J. Munsell Chase, in which
Professor Moses took part. Next Tues
day evening the club will furtner discuss
the subject of Professor Moses' address.
TO BE "MINE HOST" AGAIN
Norman, Long Known to Bohe
mians, Will Greet the
Public To-Day.
An Attractive and Airy Cafe Under
the Baldwin, With Famous
Brands of Beer.
With the anniversary of the admission
of the State, the new cafe under the Bald
win Hotel will be thrown open this after
noon and evening to tne public for gene
ral inspection, and to-morrow it will begin
business.
Otto Norman, who for so many years
I conducted on Bush street what was fami
liarly styled "the home of Bohemians,"
and who has been in the catering business
in San Francisco for the Jast seventeen
years, is behind tne enterprise in a part
nership to be known as Norman &
Iverson.
It is a pretty place, this new resort, and
something of a revelation in the con
venience of its appointments.
There is a sweeping double stairway of
white marble Jeading down from the cor
! ner of Market and Powell streets, to the
: main entrance, which is flanked by the
fresh dark green of choice tropical foliage
and small decorative palms boldly set off
by the panels of beautifully colored costly
marble behind them. Then on Powell
street, immediately opposite the Columbia
Theater, there is a similar entrance for
isdies, with a screened interior vassage
way leading to the private rooms, which
are arranged along the entire length of
the Market-street side, immediately below
tbe sidewalk.
These rooms are private withont the
objection of being so, for they have no
doors but all open their whole width to
the pretty hallway from which they are
1 separated only by loosely draped soft
toned portieres that blend with the pre
vailing tints of the walls and tbe mosaic
j floors. Lighted from above by translucent
I glass and from within by'the brilliant
glow of several incandescent electric
elobes, each of these rooms is in itself a
dainty retreat, apparently enlarged by
mirrors arranged for that effect along the
three walls.
On the other side of this hallway, and
separated by a wall with openings here
and there for pots of de'.icate palms, is
the great dining-room, larger, with only
one exception, than that of any other cafe
on the coast. It too is finished in the
1 same way as the smallnr rooms, mirrors
and electric hehts not excepted. But the
I most novel and at the came time the most
unnoticeable innovation is the ventilating
apparatus, by which the air of the whole
place can be changed completely every
fifteen minutes, to avoid entirely the dis
agreeable effects of accumulated smoke
and heated uir.
It was Norman who years aeo first intro
duced Eastern beer into this City. For
! the new place he has secured the exclusive
j agency for another Eastern beer, the Iro
! quois, rnado in Buffalo, and now having
j the biggest call of any beer in New York
I City. Another drink entirely new to this
I City will be thatol thecelebra'ted Citizens'
I Brew House of Pilsen, Austria, the beer so
j lone imitated by American manufacturers
I and that by which the town of Pilsen be
: came known to the world. In addition to
I having the agency for this celebrated
â  European beverage the new cafe will carry
I all the leading brands of Bavaria beer. A
specialty will alsa be made of the cold
lunch counter that was such en attractive
feature in Norman's old place, for here it
is to be duplicated and improved upon.

YOUNG AMERICA
AT THE PAVILION
Several Schools Take the
Mechanics' Fair by-
Storm.
CHINESE BOYS' WONDER
How the "Palace of Illusions"
Affected One Youthful
Philosopher.
STOCKTON'S POTTERY IXHIBIT.
Great Preparations in Progress for
Weighing the Babies Con
testing To-Day.
Yesterday was the school children's op
portunity to make themselves felt out at
the Mechanics' Fair, and they did things
to a brown turn. Represented were the
Agassiz Primary, the Broadway Grammar,
the Clement Grammar and the Chinese
Primary.
Those children simply took the place by
storm, and restraining them was out of
the question. As the little tots and the
more demure grammar-school children
passed from one exhibit to another child
ish ejaculations of wonder and delight
were mingled with the sager comments of
the more advanced pupils. Through the
throng passed tbe youthful citizens of the
Chinese quarter, their Tari-colored gar
ments giving tbe scene the appearance of
a human kaleidoscope. But the little
Chinese did no talking; they just gazed
and gazed until their eyes stuck out like
pigeons' eggs with wonder, saying never a
word.
In the "Palace of Illusions" the pre
cocity of Young America was excellently
exemplified. As the curtain was drawn
back showing the "half lady" and the
lovely vision from the moon, a little fel
low 111 black drew his eyebrows close to
eether in puzzled contemplation of the
scene, and failing to understand how the
tricks were worked, piped out: "Huh!
Dats a reglar fake, dat is; no woman
would live after a buzz saw'd passed troo
her waist." The whole bevy took up the
cry and it took several men to bring
peace back.
The pottery exhibit from Stockton has
just arrived and is now being arranged.
All of it i 3 made in Stockton. So closely
does it approach the Japanese in finish
that a Jap who viewed it yesterday said it
would have fooled him if he had not been
assured where it was made.
A section of the south wall of the Pa
vilion upstairs has been reserved for maps
and charts of the oil regions of the State
made by the State Mining Bureau.
The manager of the art department is
especially well pleased with the exhibit
this year. Nearly all the works on exhi
bition are by local artists. Three of the
most excellent paintings were loaned by

All tbe public school children of the
City have been sent season tickets, so as
to derive all tbe educational advantages
incident to a study of the various exhibits.
Director Healy is especially pleased with
the interest manifested by the children of
the grammar and high schools, and states
that everybody is kept busy answering the
queries of the embryonic voters.
Considerable amusement was created
yesterday by the receipt of the following
letter from a lady in Windsor, whose
name for obvious reasons is withheld:
President E. A. Devicieâ Dkab Sir: I have in
my i>o-!>e-sion * petrified kidney, perfect in
color and veining. It is recognised at a
Rlance a- genuine without the assurance of
the several physicians who have examined it.
I am very anxious to dispose of it for its value,
and write to learn if I could have it placed on
exhibUion at the Mechanics' Fair, for sale.
Last night was Chinese night, and the
Chinese Royal band made night hideous
at tho fair.
The judges in the baby show to-day
will be George T. Bromley, E. A. Otto and
Mr. Sells. The weighing will be super
vised by Directors Root, Presson, Cole

SHOT THROUGH THE LEG,
Arrival of General G. Renling
of Nicaragua for Surgical
Treatment.
He Bravely Won the Battle of La
Paz, but Himself Was Wounded
at the Close.
General G. Renling of Nicaragua, who
commanded tho Governmeat forces for
President Jose Santos Zelaya at the bloody
battle of La Paz a few months ago, an J
who was seriously wounded at tbe time,
arrived here on the steamer Newport last
night, in order to put himself under a sur
geon's care.
He was shot in the left thigh by a ball
from a French La Belle rifle. It destroyed
the sciatic nerve and his leg has shrunk to
half its natural size.
"General Francisco Baca commanded
1800 troops acainst me," said General Ren
ling, "while i had but about 1300. But I
took the town and just as I had ordered
the troops to take possession of the
â¢trenches I received this ball which laid me
I out. A good many on both sides were
killed during the engagement.
"La Paz is a little town on the railroad
between Momo Fuinbo and Leon. Baca
bad formerly attempted to seize the Gov
ernment boat and also the passenger ves
sel on Lake Nicaragua.
"I am a native of Holland and was
formerly a Government engineer in Nicar
agua. Baca, who fomented the revolu
tion, had no cause for it. President
Zelaya is a firm, successful ruler, who is
very kind to foreigners."
Renling is a handsome-looking man of
40 years. He wears the tasty uniform of
the Nicaraguan general. His leg is
swathed in bandages, and he gets about by
aid of crutches ana with difficulty. He is
at the Occidental.*
CHRISTIAN ATHLETES.
The Young Men's Association to Hold
a Field Day at the Olympic
Grounds To-Day.
The Main Young Men's Christian Asso
ciation athletes issued a short time ago a
challenge for a field day contest to the
Mission Branch Youug Men's Christian
Association's athletes, which they did not
accept. At the last meeting of the Mam
Association's athletes it was decided to
hold a handicap field-day contest between
themselves.
The handicap field-day contest will be
held at the Olympic Athletic Club's
grounds to-day at 2 p. v.
The main object of the field day is to make
preparations for the grand Young Men'a
Christian Association State pentathlon
contest which is to be held next month in
this City. The events in the State pen
tathlon contest are the following: 100
-yard dash, one-mile run, running high
jump, pole vault and 12 pound hammer
throw.
The events for the handicap field day
contest to-day will comprise the follow
inp:
100 yard!, 220 yards, 440 yards, 880 yards,
one-mile run, one-mile walk, running
high jump, running broad jimp, pole
vault, 12-pound shot put and 12-pound
hammer throw.
The sprinters of the main association
are Titus, Wilson. Guittard, Peterson,
Leiiacb, Wolfsohn, McDougall, Harder,
Rogers, Beckert. Tne distance runners
are Manning, Klarrmann, Ziska, Peterson,
Johnson, Carle, Webster, Shaw, Spacher
and Jennings. The high jumpers are Mc-
Dougall, Leilach, Scnroder, Euler.Fliesher,
Spacher, Klarrmann and Wiison. The
broad jumpers are Wilson, McDougall,
Guittard. Fliesher, Leiiacb, Titus and
Ziska. The pole vaultera are Spacher,
Kuler and iieckert. The shot-putters are
Mitchell, Curry, Fliesher, Eastwood,
Bernhart, Wilson and Ziska. The ham
mer throwers are Peterson, Mitchell,

ter, Peterson and Harder.
Wilson and Titus are runn'ng very well,
and great things are expected of them in
the sprints. Klarrmann, Manning and
Peterson are running In good form, and
ought to put up a good race in the dis
tances. Ziska is tbe "dark horse" in the
distance runs. McDougall, a new jumper,
is in very good form. Leilach is in good
condition, and will undoubtedly break the
mile record for the walk.
INCOMPATIBILITY, MADAM
The Reason Assigned by Dewitt
Dudley for Forsaking His
Wife.
A Cool Letter Written While He Was
on His Way East Never to
Return.
The suit for divorce of Martha Dudley
against Dewitt C. Dudley was heard yes
terday in the Superior Court and was
taken under consideration, there being a
technical question as to whether the de
fendant had been legally served with no
tice.
The plaintiff is a rather comely young
woman. The complaint is cruelty and de
sertion. The following rather cool letter
was introduced as part of the evidence.
It was written when the defendant was on
his wav East. He is now supposed to be
in New York:
Nevada City, Cal.. June 20, 1894.
Mrs. Dudley: I presume, madam, you
wonder at my not writing. The reason is we
did too much writing in years gone by. For
some time I have realized that we both made
a mistake in not ending our communication
before it had come to a serious end. Life in
deed is full of mistakes and my worst mistake
was when I married you, knowing as I did an
impediment existed to our ever being able to
live happily together, and ever since I have
been cursing myself for my weakness in not
withdrawing from a compact that boded no
good to either of us. Incompatibility, madam,
incompatibility, and you perhaps have not
noticed its existence, but I have. As in a pe
cuniary outlook the marriage was of no bene
fit to you I do not think it advisable to make
two persons live in a regular turmoil of aggra
vation.
It is not my Intention to again return to
I California. You may do as you wish. Get a
I divorce If you can find grounds and marry
! again. I do not care. Marriage Is looked
I upon as a failure, anyhow. One thing, pray
spare me those maledictions you can so easily
bestow. I don't want any of them; they are
I useless, and I never pay any attention to them
â  beside*. You need not bother writing to me.
j I consider it best, end I don't want to hear
from you, and if you should be so foolish as to
write I shall either destroy the letter un
opened or return it without reading. â¢ â¢ â¢
Hoping you can see the advisability of the
foregoing and not make idiotic attempts to
annoy me, I remain, madam, yours in fare
well, . C. D. Dudley.

OUT OF THE
INDIAN COUNTRY
G. F. Schumacher's Exper
iences North of the
Upper Columbia.
HE FOUND SOME GOLD.
An Undulating Region Covered
With Bunch Grass and Dot
ted With Pine Trees.
WILD GAME VERY PLENTIFUL
Herds ot Deer, Many Black and Cin
namon Bear ani Grouse and
Waterfowl by Thousands.
Among the arrivals at the Commercial
Hotel is E. F. Schumacher, wdo for sev
eral months past has been prospecting for
gold in the new country north of the Col
umbia River, next to British Columbia.
This country has long been known as the
Colviile Indian reservation. It is only a
short time since it was thrown open to
settlement.
Mr. Schumacher prospected some of the
country lying between Kettle Falls and
Bonaparte Mountain, a distance of about
twenty-five miles from the British line.
He has had a Jong experience in mining
in different parts of the country, and is
therefore an unusually good judge of a
mining section.
"I found a beautiful, undulating coun
try," he said, "dotted with pine and fir
trees in many places, so as to make it
look like a great National park. A heavy
grass covered the bills, too. It was mostly
bunch grass, so that the country may be
called exceptionally good for stock. There
is an abundance of clear running water.
The country is a little too high for agri
culture, however, except in the case of a
few little valleys. These valleys have all
been taken by early French settlers, who
were formerly members of the Hudson
Bay Company, and who have married In
dian squaws and settled down there.
"Therefore, so far as throwing open the
reservation is concerned it amounts to lit
tle. The Government opened it over a
year ago, bnt few agricultural locations
have been made.
"A {treat many went in and began to
prospect, however. As yet it may be said
tnere are no mines discovered. But there
are a good many good prospects. The
formation is the same as at Itossland, B.
(X, where the Le Roy mine has been
opened up, and >vhicli is said now to be
worth several millions.
"The ore is found at a shallow depth,
and runs pretty well in gold, with a trace
of copper and some silver. It is a cool
place even in summer time. One night in
June the ice froze a quarter of an inch
thick.
"It is a great country for wild game. I
never saw a region where deer were so
plentiful. They literally swarmed over
the hills. It was no trouble for the miners
to get all ihe meat they wanted. Bear
were plentiful too. They were of the
black and cinnamon kind. Grouse were
to be seen everywhere. If yon went to a
miner's camp you always saw the feathers
lying about.
"It wasn't quite far enough north for
moose and cariboo, bnt a few miles away
tney were quite plentiful. As for water
fowl of fill kinds they could be had in
abundance.
"Travel is active in connection with the
Trail Cicek and Siocan mines. Coming
down from Kettle Falls the two cars of
the Spokane and Northern train were
crowded. Spokane itself is very lively. It
seemed to have a real boom on. The
streets were pretty well thronged." "
They Have Withdrawn.

IT'S CURES
THAT COUNT.
Many so-called remedies are
pressed on the public attention
on account of their claimed
large sales. But sales cannot
determine values. Sales simply
argue good salesmen, shrewd
puffery, or enormous advertis-
ing. It's cures that count. It
is cure-s that are counted on by
Ayer's Sarsaparilla. Its sales
might be boasted. It has the
world for its market. But
sales prove nothing. We point
only to the record of Ayer's
Sarsaparilla, as proof of its
merit :

ME. KEINSTEIN'S SUGGESTION.
More Power and Dignity Will Be
Given to the Physical Culture
Department.
The Board of Regents, University of
California, met yesterday afternoon and
awarded contracts for construction of the
Alii Hated Colleges on the land deeded to
the board by Mayor Sutro.
The contracts were awarded as follows:
For masonry, including all brick work, terra
rotta work, concrete and all necessary excava
tion based on using granite, Ray Building ana
Construction Company, $143,500.
Iron work, Pacific Rolling-mills, $4925.
Carpenter, plastering and electric and gins
ing work, S. Carle, $67,219.
Plumbing and gas-fitting work, D. C. Swee
ney, $11,193.
Heating work, E. J. Law ton, $8325.
Tinning, galvanized iron and slating work,
Joseph F. Forderer. $9975.
Painting and graining work, $3780.
The report of the committee recommend
ing the foregoing bidders as the Jowest is
signed by Regents J. West Martin and
John E. Budd.
The aggregate amount of the bids is
$248,928. It was found that the board did
nut have sufficient money to make the
award, but a communication was received
from Martens, Coffev <fc Kroft, the archi
tects, waiving their commission and a
tender ol $1151 was made by Dr. Beverley
R. Cole. The architects' waiver and Dr.
Cole's contribution were received in writ
ing, and the board passed resolution of
acceptance. The contributed sums brought
the transaction within the limit of money
on hand.
It appeared that the bid of J. ri. Riley
of San Jose for sandstone was $142,000, but
the regents preferred granite, hence the
award to the Ray Building and Construc
tion Company at the figure of $143,500.
The proceedings disclosed the tact that
granite quarried by prison labor at Fol
som will be used in the college buildings.
The regents adopted a resolution assur
ing the Prison Directors that the granite
used would inure only to the benefit of
the Affiliated Colleges. This resolution is
responsive to proceedings taken by the
Eoard of Prison Directors in September,
1886.
IÂ»r. Beverly R. Cole received a vote of
thanks for his generous contribution of
cash. He responded in a graceful little
speech, expressing his pleasure that tne
lonj; contest for the building of the col
leges had culminated in victory. He men
tioned incidentally that he had worked in
behalf of the enterprise for seven years,
and in closing promised to dedicate the
remaining years of his life to the univer
sity.
Judge Waymire, who was a member of
the last .Legislature, paid a tribute to tbe
zeal and eloquence of Dr. Cole in behalf
of tbe appropriation of money for the col
leges.
Regent Reinstein- introduced the sub
ject of providing tents for students at the
university. He said the classrooms were
inadequate, and something should be done
at once to provide room. A suegestion
was made that military tents might be ob
tained from the Government. Mr. Rein
stein replied that large tents, each capable
of accommodating fifty students, were
needed. The subject was referred to the
committees of finance and buildings and
grounds.
The spreading of tents to shelter the
students would no doubt produce such a
spectacular effect as would arrest the at
tention of the Legislature. Tlie eyes of
the regents are now turned to Sacramento,
and a great effort will be made for a big
appropriation.
There was considerable talk yesterday
about elevating the department of physi
cal culture to the importance which
modern methods of instruction ascribe to
that form of education. The assistant
professor will hereafter be known as
director and he will have a vote in the
faculty. Mr. Haludie said that the de
partment would be reorganized when more
money was available.
On account of the lack of funds tbe
finance committee reported against the
employment of a fellow to assist Director
Holden at Mount Hamilton.
The regents decided that the Michael
Reese fund of $50,000 could not be used for
any purpose other than the purchase of
books.
The regents attending the session were
Phelps (presiding), Marye, John E. Budd,
Crocker, Rowel!, Kellogg, Martin,
Denicke, Hallidie, Fonte, Reinstein, Mil
ler, Waymire and Slack.
Not a word was said of the Bonnell-
Flagg controversy.
AGAINST THE CHARTER.
The American Women's Liberal League
Adopts Kesulutions Scoring Ad-,
vocates of a Certain Section.
At a regular meeting of the Committee
of the American Women's Liberal
League, the following resolutions were
unanimously adopted:
Whereas, At a mass-meeting of the Citizens'
Charter Association held in Metropolitan
Temple on Friday evening, September 4, one
Thomas F. Barry, while trying to demonstrate
who are the opponents of the newchnrter, did
maliciously and grossly insult Catholic eiils
of this City by coupling them with his idea of
thugs, anrl a Police Department, that to his
perverted idea, fears investigation; ami
whereas, this league has at all times op
pOKd the new charter on account of its KHd
ernl, unjust and intolerant spirit, its un-Ameri
can tendencies, the evidences of its hasty con
struction, its disposition to make an aulocrat
of one officer lor whose election it does not
provide and the fact that it is a rehash of
charters that have already been rejected with
a few more objectionable points added,
yet in all our opposition we have
fniled to discover thut the Fire and
Police departments have ever expressed
themselves in this relation. They have, how
ever, impressed us as the men who stand in
tbe frcnt ranks of those who contribute to the
de:ense <l our lives and homes, some of them
oven perishing at their posts of duty for the
lives and homes of such ingrates as Thomas F.
Barry, and we believe they shall bo continue
to respond after Mr. Barry and his confreres
shnll hnve been relegat* d to the fabled waters
of the otvjc; therefore, be it
Hesolved, That we believe Thomas F. Barry's
remurks are not only erratic, and lack all
semblance to truth ana common-sense, but
also prove that Mr. Barry lacks the attributes
of a Rentleman.
Jtesolvfd. That we deny that the Fire and
Police departments control or in any way
affect the interests of Catholic girls, or those
of any other denominations, in school matters,
or any rights guaranteed them as Americans.
Resolved, That we congratulate James D.
Phelan on the rally of .such gallant allies us
Thomas F. Barry and others to the standard
which fosters and encourages the bigotry and
prejudice for which their ancestors sought a
home in other climes than the land of their
birth.
Retalved, That we denounce aa weak and
absurd the answer of William F. Gibson, that
the section objected to, in relation to the ap
pointment of teachers, emanated from the fact
that heretofore "importations" from the East
had been employed as soon as they reached
town, and that "newspapers" alleged that in
competent teachers secured positions to the
exclusion of natives of California, who had
qualified here. No such employment could
have been made, in view of the rigid measures
at all times required to test a teacher's quali
fications, unless some School Directors be
trayed their trusts, or -were willfully derelict
to duty, and the new charter makes no pro
vision against a repetition of such dereliction.
Resolved, That we ask of William F. Gibson,
if his reasons as given for framing this section
are in good faith, why are the schools quali
fied by the words public? Why not say the
schools of California, when the charter re
quires all to pass a competitive examination?
We ask this particularly, since Mr. Gibson has
stated to a member of this league, that he be
lieved this section was a thrust at private and
parochial schools.
Resolved, That we believe, according to Mr.
Gibson's answers, the new charter say* one
thing and means another. The charter pro
vides that certain teachers must be educated
in the public schools, but Mr. Gibson says any
person who has taken a course in any of the
public schools is considered to have been ed
ucated therein. According to this reasoning,
a person taking an alphabetical course in the
public schools and afterward graduating from
Stanford University would be considered ed
ucated in the public schools.
Resolved, That Mr. Gibson's answer in regard
to the tenure of office of a teacher and his
quotation of a Supreme Court decision do not
agree with the new charter, which says that
the Board ol Education shall have power to
grant and revoke certificates, and that the
board shall determine the caus-e for which a
teacher shall be dismissed, and we note that
no limitations are placed on this power.
Resolved, That we believe that when an
applicant for a teacher's position is proven
qualified by the examination necessary to
secure a certificate, such credential is a suffi
cient guarantee of competency, and require
ment to taice an additional course in a normal
school, when such proof can be thus furnished,
is calculated to impede the freedom of educa
tion, which is a bulwark of our liberties.
Resolved, That we believe the method of
Chairman Davis in declaring the resolutions
unanimously adopted, without calling for the
negative vote, is in perfect keeping with the
views of the speakers, all onesided.
AGAINST THE NOE HEIRS,
Judge Sanderson Decides the
Long Contested
Case.
Suit Involving the Validity of Titles
to Land Worth Many
Millions.
The long-contested suit of the Noe
heirs, involving the validity of titles to a
large amou nt of land in tbe Mission, val
ued up in the millions, was decided yes
terday by J udge Sanderson against the
Noe heirs.
The suit was brought with the purpose
of quieting title to an undivided half of
the Miguel rancho, containing something
above 4000 acres, granted to Jose de Jesus
Noe by Governor Pio Pico in 1846. The
suit was brought by the heirs of Noe's
wife, upon the ground that the wife had a
community interest.
The question involved was based on thij
pointâ whether tho grant to the husband
vested in his wife a community interest.
The court decided against the plaintiff
heirs and in favor of the defendants, who
number over 1000. Judge Sanderson in
the opinion filed says:
The land in question here was given out
right by the Mexican Government to Noe in
1846. He paid nothing whatever for it, and
some eight years later he sold it to Homer for
$70,000, it appears, and now, half a century
later, the property, largely covered by im
provements, is said by counsel to be worth up
ward of $50,000,000. Upon it are founded the
homes and probably the entire fortunes of
thousands of the inhabitants of this City, who
have already lived there in perfect legal se
curity as to their titles, which have been un
questioned for nearly. If not quite, thirty years
last past.
At this late day an assault of this character
upon these titles, based on aquestion and con
tention of law long since definitely fixed and
settled by our courts, must strike the ordinary
mind as wholly without justification and
prompt the wish and show the necessity Jor
some remedy at the harms of our legislators
whereby long-established owners of property,
such as the numerous defendants in this ac
tion may, if possible, be protected in some
manner from the bringing of suits like the
present one against them to determine a ques
tion long since laid at rest, without being com
pelled to undergo the expense and annoyance
of defending an unfounded action in order to
keep their titles unclouded.
There is no way under the present law, so
far as I am advised, by which the good faith of
the plaintiffs in such suits can be tested or
guaranteed prior to trial, but this I believe
can be effected by a proper law in that benalf.
The necessity for such a remedy could easily
be more forcibly illustrated, in my opinion,
than Dy the present suit.
It muy be added that the point heretofore
stated is not the sole ground on which an
action like this and based upon similar facts
would be defeated in this Slate.
Our Supreme Court has held that where
property, as a matter ol law, becomes com
munity property, as is claimed by plaintiffs
here, nevertheless the right remained with
the husband to dispose o< the same, in the
absence of fraud, and likewise to sell and dis
pose of the entire community property in
order to pay community debts; "and where the
property was sold, as here, for a valuable con
sideration it would be presumed that the hus
bund disposed of the property for that pur
pose and a valid title to the whole property
would pass thereby.
There were over 1000 defendants in this
suit.
HER PATHE TIC STORY.
Km ma Peterson, a Young Girl, Sent to
the Receiving Hospital.
Emma Peterson, a pretty girl 20 years
of age, was found on Washington-street
wharf yesterday afternoon by Sergeant
Tom Mahoney, and as he thought she in
tended to commit suicide, he sen t her to
the Receiving Hospital in the patrol
wagon.
She had been sitting on a pile of lnmber
for about two hours, and her appearance
was so dejected that Mahoney determined
to watch her. When he saw her leave her
seat on the lumber pile and sit on the
stringers he concluded it was time to act.
The girl told her story in the hospital.
She said: "I had no intention of com
mitting suicide and was paring my nails
when the policemau arrested me. I am
troubled with headaches and often go to
the wharves, as the breeze from the sea
does me good.
"I came from Norway two years ago
and kept house for my brother, Julius
Peterson, a carpenter at 1911 O'Farrell
street. He was so unkind to me that I
tried to get a situation. I got one with a
family named Meyers at 1911 Bu*h street.
There were ten in the family, and as I had
to do all the work and only got $10 a
month, I left there two or three weeks ago.
I went back to my brother's, but he was
so unkind that lor the past two weeks I
have been wandering about the streets
trying to get something to do. I was
arrested two or three days ago but was
discharged after I told my story."
The girl told Mrs. Keane, the matron,
that sne had a sweetheart, Ole Olsen a
sailor on the Umatilla, which is now lying
at the Broadway wharf, and as soon as
they got enou-h money, they would be
married. Efforts will be made to find a
home for her.
Escaped From an Asylum.
P. O'Connor was arrested on Market street
Monday night for being drunk. Yesterday
morning he told Captain Robinson at the
City Prison that he had made his escape from
the btockton Insane Asylum because they
made him peel potatoes and would not give
him any tobacco. He was sent to the Receiv
ing Hospital aud the asylum authorities were
notified.
Broke Her Arm.
Mrs. Catherine Griffin had a broken arm
diessÃQ Â»t the Receiving Hospital yesterday
morning.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1896.
WINTHROP HAD
CAMPBELL'S PURSE
The Planter Identifies Prop
erty Stolen From
Him.
STRONG BIT OF EVIDENCE
The Prisoner Wanted to Recover
His Telegrams Sent to
Urquhart.
BUT THE W. U. DECLINED.
They Also Are Offered and Tell
Against the Defendant â The
Proceedings.
Oliver Winthrop was a close and anx
ious listener to the testimony against him
adduced before Judge Wallace yesterday
on the charge of attempting to extort
$20,000 from James Campbell, the Ha
waiian planter.' His wife sat beside him
all day, lying back in her chair for the
most part, with a very weary expression.
An important link in the chain of evi
dence was developed. Detective Charles
Cody, in telling of the arrest of Winthrop
in Oakland, said that upon searching tbe
prisoner a purse containing $7 was found,
besides some small coin in a vest pocket,
together with a railroad ticket to Mojave.
James Campbell, the complaining wit
ness, became interested at the mention of
the purse, and, it being put in evidence,
asked to be allowed to examine it. Upon
its being handed to him he said at once:
"This is mine; it was taken from me
while I was held a prisoner in the cot
tape."
This, of course, is considered very im
portant, as it directly connects the pris
oner with the crime.
"Did Winthrop say anything when he
was searched?" was asked the witness.
"He said, 'Weil, the jig is up.' "
"Was the prisoner searched again?"
"Yes. When he was brought to this
City Detective Seymour searched him
again and found in the tops of his shoes
three $20 gold pieces."
Detective Seymour being called corrobo
rated this and said, lurther, that Camp
bell and Winthrop were brought together
in a room of the Police Department at the
City Hall and that Campbell at once
identified Winthrop as ;he man who had
imprisoned and tortured him. Campbell
then retired and Winthrop inquired,
"Who is that man?"
"I asked him if he had never seen him
before," said tbe witness, "and he de
clined answering."
The witness produced a steel spilt ring
which he said he found in the basement of
the cottage at 4109 California street.
Oth'cer Clancey being placed on tbe
stand testified to having searched the
cottage on Aupust 16, and to have found
hidden behind a coal bin in the basement
a chain with a staple attached, and also a
quantity oi rope, which was also attempted
to be hidden.
Manager Frank Jaynes of the Western
Union Company was the next to testify.
At the request of Mr. Barnes, he produced
telegrams sent from this City to San Jose
addressed to D. A. Urquhart by Winthrop
bearing date of July 31.
On motion of Mr. Barnes, the telegrams,
which mude appointments between Win
throp and Urqtihart, were then introduced
in evidence, against the objection of the
defense.
Mr. Barnes next produced a letter, which
he asked to have introduced in evidence.
The defense strenuously objected. Judge
Wallace asked to see the document, and it
turned out to be an order signed by v7in
trop and addressed to Mr. Jaynes, ordering
him to deliver to Attorney Bell all tele
grams which he (Winthrop) had sent to
Urquhart from San Jose, the intention
being to remove the messages from the
Western Union tiles.
In order to prove that Winthroo signed
the letter to Mr. Jaynes Mr. Barnes put At
torney Bell on the stand.
The lawyer admitted having written the
body of the letter, but declined to *tate
whether or not Winthrop signed it, claim
ing that if he did so it was a privileged
communication. In that position he was
sustained by the court.
Mr. Jaynes then resumed by stating that
Mr. Bell called at me Western Union office
regarding the telegram, but the witness
did not see him.
"You have another telegram sent from
San Jose on July 31 and signed Winthrop,
have you?" asked Mr. isarnes.
"1 have it here sealed, and will not open
it except by direction of the court, as I
do not know whether it refers to this case
or not."
Judge Wallace ordered the witness to
open the envelope. Mr. Barnes and Cap
tain Lees read it. The telegram turned
out to be a cipher dispatch to Attorney
Quitzow. It was finally admitted for
identification. It ran as follows:
San Jose, July 31, 1896.
H. W. Quitzow, San Francisco: See Main, 8
Alpine street. President thirty-six. Be
cautious. Winthrop.
The case was continued over until to
morrow, as the court will be closed to-day.
SUBSIDIES FOR SHIPS
The Liberal Sums Which Are
Now Paid by European
Governments.
Competition With Japan Impossible.
Important Advices From
Washington.
At yesterday's session of the board of
trustees of the ChamDer of Commerce a
communication was read from the Ameri
can Merchant Marine Association of New
York, giving a rough estimate of the sub
sidies, bonuses, etc., paid by European
Governments to their steam and sail ton
nage. It shows that tbe total amount
paid by Great Britain was $5,033,440; by
Germany, $1,240,000; by Norway and Swe
den, $318,000; by France, $2,100,000; by
Italy, $801,917; by Austria-Hungary,
$1,600,000.
It is evident, from these figures, that
with the $20,000 subsidy in silver Japan
will pay each way to steamers of 5000 tons
burden on the line about to be established
between the United States and the Orient,
no steamers flying the American or Eng
lish flag cmi afford tc navigate the Pacific
Ocean in competition with them. The
subsidy will pay tbe expenses of coal,
provisions and wa<res, leaving the earn
ings on freight and passage comparatively
cJenr profit."
Un ted States Senator John T. Morgan
of A bama in reply to a resolution of
thaiia.s passed by the chamber, wrote:
I hold in great Honor ana esteem the men
who, through your Chamber of Commerce,
have accomplished so much and are resolved
to continue the great work of developing and
controlling those immense resources of wealth
and of our prosperity and glory as a leading
power in the world." That my devotion to a
work that is so inviting and full of the re
quirements of duty should have been so
kindly approved by your Chamber of Com
merce gives me a gratification that more than
compensates me for the inefficient support I
have been able to give in the Senate.
Should I live to see Alabama and California
brought into tbe commercial relations due to
these great States of our southern border, and
to share in rendering to you, sir (Captain W.
L- Merry), the proper reward of gratitude for
your enlightened and courageous' support of
the Nicaraguan canal, I shall reeard that
service as being in the highest sense honorable
and desirable.
It was stated in a communication from
the Department of State at Washington
that the name of Dr. Raffel haa been sub
mitted for appointment as president of
the Municipal Council at At>ia, Samoa, in
place of James R. Watson, objected to by
the chamber as being inimical to Ameri
can interests.
Secretary Beanston informed the cham
ber that its petition for the establishment
by the Board .of Education of an evening
school of navigation for boys was under
consideration, tut would not be finally
acted upon until the latter part of this
month.

"KING" McMANUS DYING
The Ruler of the Potrero in Past
Years Waiting for the
End.
He Has Managed to Fight Death Away
for More Than Three Months
of Torture.
The "King of the Potrero" is lying nigh
unto death.
Stricken with dropsy of the stomach,
Franic McManns has been obliged to lay
aside his scepter for the time being, and
his subjects, who crowd about his bedside
nightly, have little hope of his recovery.
A consultation of physicians was held
Frank McManus.
yesterday to determine whether the pa
tient should be operated upon, and it was
decided that the operation might be de
layed until Dr. Morse of the Board of
Health returns from Stockton on Thurs
day.
No man is better known in the middle
stratum of politics than Frank McManus.
Years ago he absolutely controlled the
suffrage in this County south of Mission
Creek, the voters of the Union Iron Works
and the slaughter-houses casting their
ballots according to his dictum. His ab
sence from the field in this campaign has
been a noticeable feature.
Four months ago McManus was taken
sick, and from a man of powerful physique,
weighing 230 pounds, he has fallen away
to a mere skeleton, weighing less than 150
pounds.
BOLLES GETS THE PLUM.
Tho Captain of the Columbia Will Be
Blade Local Inspector of
Boilerg.
Captain O. F. Bolles of the steamer
Columbia will receive the appointment of
local inspector of hulls and boilers, made
vacant by the recent death of Captain Tal
bot. At least such is the recommendation
of the special commission consisting of
Judge Morrow, Collector Wise and Super
vising Inspector Bermingham.
On Friday last an examination for the
vacant position was held at the Hulls and
Boilers office, Appraiser's building, six
well-known sea captains undergoing the
test. Yesterday their papers were opened
and Cai-tain Bolles was found to have ob
tained the highest percentage â 90 â Cap
tain F. W. Hart of the Zeaiandia beine next
on the list.
The successful aspirant was born in
Massachusetts, in 1840. From his appli
cation now on file in the Hulls and Boilers
office it is learned that he wont to sea
when only 18 years oid. In time he be
came mate of sailing ana steamship ves
sels, and for the last twenty-six years has
been a licensed master. Captain Bolles is
one of the most popular captains on the
coast and his appointment by the Secre
tary of the Treasury, on the recommenda
tion of the local board, is most deserving.
HAD TO BE SHOT.
A Valuable Horse Comes to Grief in Â»
Free Fight.
No small disturbance was created yes
terday morning at Sells & Forepaugb's
circus by a free fight among the stallions.
The powerful brutes bit, kicked and
jumped upon each other in the wildest
fashion, and before tbe hostlars could re
duce them to subjection one beautiful and
valuable white horse had been so severely
kicked that its sufferings were painful to
witness.
Officer McCurrie of the Society tor the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was
summoned to the scene of tbe equine
lray, and at the request of the proprietors
ended the stalliou's misery by shooting it
through the head. The men who bad
been in charge of the horse had learned to
love him for his rare beauty and intelli
gence, and would not remain to see him
shot.
Italian Consul Banqueted.
Cay. F. Serra, the new Italian Consul,
was given a banquet last night at the Maison
Riche by the board of electors of the Italian
Chamber of Commerce. The occasion was the
first formal introduction of the recent arrival
to the representative men of Importance in
tne Italian colony of this City. A very elabo
rate menu of sixteen courses was served. The
following were seated about the single table:
Cay. F. Serra, Royal Consul-General, F.
Cavajnaro, P. C. Rossi, D. BUgi, F. Rossi, Dr.
V. Vaccari, Captain L. Bnglietto. C. Dondero,

ALL NATIONS IN
CARNIVAL ARRAY
Final Preparations for a
Brilliant Social
Event
MUSIC AND TABLEAUX.
Coming Fete of the Women's
Educational and Indus
trial Union.
LIST OF THE PARTICIPANTS.
Judging From Present Indications the
Affair Will Be a Magnifi
cent Success.
Great preparations are being made for
the splendid Carnival of Nations, which
will open on the evening of the 21st inst.
in Natfve Sons' Hall, on Mason street,
near Post. The affair is to be conducted
by the members and friends of the
Women's Educational and Industrial
Union, and hopes are cherished that it
will result in the addition of a substantial
sum to the union's building fund.
"If the carnival be a success," said Mme.
Louise Sorbier, president of the union,
yesterday, "we intend to employ a part of
the proceeds in the construction of a free
gymnasium for women. Our main object,
however, is to get a Lome of our own. We
have many friends, and I for one am sure
they will do their best to aid us in realiz
ing this good purpose. There will be
many new and attractive features in the
carnival, and I am sure all visitors will
find it a most unique and delightful
affair."

Token* of Appreciation by Hia
Employers.
Engineer E. F. Ingles, the hero of Web

ent and the ceremony was simple. Mr.

I Mr. Edward F. Ingles, from the Southern
| Pacific Railway Company in recognition
| of his heroic conduct in savins; his train
from robbers. September 5, 1896.''

TO EDUCATE THE EAST,
A Proposal to Have a State
Exhibit at a Distant
City.
Request for Articles for the Phi a
deipbia National Produce
Mns urn.
The directors of the State Board of Trade
held their regular monthly meeting yester
day. At the last gathering of the directors
Will E. Fisher, in a communication, sug
gested that the different commercial
organizations of tiie State and the State
Board of Trade unite in the collection of a
produce exhibit to be maintained in some
large Eastera city.
The committee which had been ap
pointed by the board to investigate the
proposed matter reported that the ex
penses of collecting and forwarding the
exhibit, such as would be a credit to Cali
fornia, would amount to $7250. The cost
of maintaining this collection in a good
locality for the first year would be $9200
and the following year about $10,000. This
would mate the total cost for two years
$26,450.
The committee recommended that the
board notify the different commercial
bodies that it was willing to undertake the
collection and maintenance of an adequate
exhibit of the resources of the State for
the sum mentioned.
It was also recommended by the board
that legislative action be taken whereby
the counties of the State be authorized to
raise their yearly exhibition fund from
$1000 to $2000, and al-o that a permanent
Slate fund of $25,000 annually be appro
priated for exhibition purposes.
The proposition to make a produce ex
hibition at the Golden Gate Park Museum
was not favored by the board as such ex
hibition would injure the exhibit at the
Board of Trade rooms in this City.
Tbe directors of the great National
Produce Museum at Philadelphia, which
is maintained by that city, have requested
that ihe different State boards appoint
two representatives to confer with them
on the subject o! perfecting the Philadel
phia exhibition.
The museum managers desire to receive
constantly articles for exhibit from all
over the United States. They collect and
transport all articles to the museum at
their own expense.
The matter was favorably considered.

WAS STOLEN
Enterprising Boys Did a
Contractor's Work for
Him.
NEIGHBORS ARE DAZED.
At Dark the Dwelling Was
There, and at Daylight It
Was Gone.
NOT A STICK LEFT STANDING.
Residents About the Corner of Larkin
and Greenwich Streets Hear
Strange Noises.
Residents of the section about the juno
tion of Greenwich and Larkin streets
whose windows look out on tbe southwest
corner of the thoroughfares mentioned
ru bbed their eyes when they first took a
peep at the weather yesterday morning
and then looked again to see that they
were not dreaming.
A lot that at dark Monday nieht had
contained a substantial story and a half
dwelling-house was empty. There was
nothing but broken foundations and a few
riles of broken plaster to show where the
structure had stood.
while the matter was being talked of in
the neighborhood five teams of horses
drawing heavy lumber wagons containing
ropes, pulleys and a gang of workmen
drove up and the same look of astonish
ment that had overspread the faces of the
neighbors was apparent on their counte
nances.
They left after contemplating the place
a while and assuring themselves that tbe
lot was the one they had been looking for.
An hour later an excited man drove up in a
buggy, looked at the barren place where the
building had stood, said a few words more
forcible than elegant, made a few inquiries
and then left in disgust.
During these visits the boys of the
neighborhood Btood and looked wise and
innocent, and only exchanged grins when
the visitors were out of sight.
The key of the mysterious disappear
ance of tde dwelling was that it had been
Ftolen piecemeal to the last timber during
the hours between 9 o'clock on Monday
evening and 3 o'clock yesterday morning,
ana many a family in the neighborhood
will revel in free wood and kindling for
months to come.
Tne building belonged to a wealthy
young woman named Miss Loveland, who
lives in Alameda. Some time ago she
was notified by the Board of Health, on
the report of the inspector, that she ruust
improve the. sanitation of the place, the
plumbing not being of the most modern
Kind. Miss Loveland did not wait, as the
owners of Chinatown buildings did, until
the board took the matter in a serious
light, but at once decided that it would be
cheaper to tear down the building, and
the accordingly notified her tenants, a
family named Duffy, to be out by tne Ist
but.
Then the agents were instructed to sell
the building to be removed. Tne firm of
contractors ibat secured the dwelling
began work on Monday, and by night had
taken away a portion of the roof.
The lads about the neighborhood, ever
on the lookout for stray bits of lumber
suitable for firewood, lookjed on with long-
Ing eyes. Tbe men left about 5 o'clocic,
taking with them in wagons the lumber
that had been removed, intending to finish
the demolition the next day, "but they
never saw another stick of the timber that
had been used in the construction of that
house.
Shortly after dark boys with ropes in
their hands and under their coats began
to gather in the neighborhood, and by 9
o'clock a big crowd had gathered. Then,
as if by a prearranged plan, an attack was
made on the place that only ceased when
the last lath and weatherboarding nad
been hidden away for the winter's Bupply
ol kindling.
Many of the neighbors heard the racket
as the boards were torn noisily from tbe
rafters or when the heavy beams fell
with a crash, but experience has taught
them that in that locality it is as well to
say nothing and look wisp, unless your
own property be attacked, and they said
never a word, even when the loud voices
of the boys as they fought over choice
bits of lumber kept them awake until 3
o'clock. The gang that first began opera
tions on the bouse did not number over
twenty to twen:y-five members, but the
news of the raid spread until men and
boys from several blocks distant joined in
tbe loot and the crack of breaking boards
became almost continuous.
Thus it was that w: ; en the contractor's
employes returned yesterday they found
their occupation gone and not even a
lath in sight.
"What the blue-coated guardian of the
reace whose beat covers that neighbor
hood was doing whiie the house was be
ing wrecked and carted away has not as
yet developed, but it is presumed that he
must have had an engagement in some
portion of his domain that destroyed hiÃ
sense of hearing.
CHOKED UP WITH SAND.
Richmond Folks Complain of
Obstructed Streets and
Cesspools.
Various Matters of Interest Considered
by the Point Lcbos Improve
ment Club
A Jaree attendance was present at last
night's meeting of tbe Point Lobos Im
provement Club, held in Crostbwaite's
Hall, oa Fifth avenue.
The drifting-sand comm tee reported
that Twenty-fourth avenu , between A
and B streets, was utterly choked witb
t-and, in some places to a depth of thirty
five feet. The condition of the avenue
had been reported to the Board of Super
visors, and tbe work of regrading the
ihorouÃhfare had been committed by the
board to a contractor named Tuttle. It
was decided that a communication on the
subject ehoiiid be addressed by the club to
the Board of (supervisor*, requesting the
irnnieiiate Jolhllment o? the contract.
Dr. Wolf reported that an electric light
v as vadly needed at tbe intersection of
Fourth and Point Lobos avenues. It was
considered advisable to defer action in the
matter until after tbe commg meeting of
the Board of Supervisors, when the Street
lighting Committee will know whether it
can count wÂ»tÂ» sufficient lunds for the
placing of additional lights.
The secretary was instructed to com
municate with the Supervisors :n relation
v a number of cesspools which hÂ».ve been
tendered useiÂ«BS by reason of their being
â¢ â¢â¢uirely choked up with eand. It was also
decided that the Supervisors and Park
Commissioners should be asked to procure
the removal of unused car-tracks on Point
Lobos avenue, west of First.
A communication was ordered sent to
the respective principals protesting
against a practice said to prevail in the
Richmond and Point Lobos schools
whereby children are oblieed to be in
school at 8:45 o'clock In the morning, in
piace of nine, the pupils being marked a
half-day absent in case they arrive at
school later than the first-named hour.

IN THE INTEREST OF BOYS
Creditable Work During the
Half Year of the Youths'
Directory.
Eloquent Statement Submitted by
Secretary Kane to Rev. Father
D. 0. Crcwley.
The semi-annual report of the Youths'
Directory for the â  period commencing
March 1 and ending August 31, 1896, has
been filed with Rev. Father D. 0. Crowley
by Secretary F. J. Kane. Following the
report is a statement issued by Father
Crowley, which shows that the highest
number of boys ever entertained by the
directory during one twelvemonth was
about 525. "But," continues the report,
"already in the current year, with six
months of it yet to run, we have lodged
267 children. Allowing the same number
for the latter half of the year the total
should mount up to 534. Bat in the
winter months we receive a greater num
ber than in the warmer season, and be
tween September 1, 1596, and March 1,
1897, we all probably be obliged to find
beds and food for 300 boys.
"These figures are silent in regard to the
many for whom we have obtained shelter
in other institutions. Our capacity is
limited, and until we can build a larger
home we must stand still. We trust our
need of more room will not long remain
unsupplied."

WILL WILLIAMS TALK?
The Ex-Inspector Is Said to Ec
Ready to Tell What He
Knows.
Former Attorneys Dismissed and the
Case Placed in tbe Hands of
G2orge Collins.
Dick Williams, convicted six days ago
on two counts of extortion, is chafing
under the confinement to which he is now
subjected at the County Jail. In fact, the
ex-inspector seema to be on the eve of
tellins all that he knows, though jast how
far this reaches can as yet only be sur
mised.
The first step taken in this direction
was the discharge on Monday last
of his attorneys, Mowry and Coogan.
He told the^e gentlemen that their ser
vices were no loncer required, for the pre
sumed reason that they had failed to se
cure an acquittal or even a mistrial. Oa
the other hand the statement is made
that Mo wry and Coogan were employed
by outside parties to defend Williams and
tii&t since the conviction of the latter
these unknown friends refupa to put up
any more coin in the shape oi attorneys'
fees.
It matters little, however, which state
ment be correct, for the fact still remains
that Mowry and Cooran nave been re
placed by Attorney George D. Collins.
This iast named gentleman, it may be re
marked, uus all aiontj been Williams' at
torney in the divorce proceedings recently
instituted by his wife.
"I have only one criticism to make,"
said Collins yesterday, "and that concerns
the rulings of the Judge, of course I will
take an appeal, and in time secure an ac
quittal for my client.
"William*, so far as I know, has no con
fession to make, at least he will never
make one with my consent. If he thinks,
however, it is to his interest to make any
concession to the Government he will do
so on his own responsibility. He might
and probably does know a great deal, but
so lar as I can I c that has nothing to do
with his case. Wnat de expects to accom
plish by bringing others into the affair I
do not at pre-ent see."
Mrs. Williams has also thought it pru
dent to make a change in legal advisers.
Attorney Lawrence has been put out. in
the cold ami Attorneys Dunn and MuPike
will represent thÂ» ex-insuector'B wife in
the divorce proceedings, which come up
for final hearing next Thursday.
There are now, it is computed, over 250.
-000 words in the English language, or
about 70.000 more than in the German,
French, Spanish ana Italian languages
combined.
NEW TO-DAY.
to V* *â 
"If it had not been for this one error I
should be a sound, healthy man to-day,
instead of a wreck, physically and men-
tally." This three months ago from a
man who writes: "My troubles are over.
I am a better man to-day than I ever was,
and I owe it all to your wonderful Belt."
Is there such an "if" in your experience?
Does it mar your life? Do you want it
removed?
This is the ape of progress. A means
has been found for the restoration of
manly vieor. It is
Dr. Sanden's
Electric Belt.
" Never failing in its invigorating powers,
it has made thousands of vigorous men
out of as many weak, despondent crea-
tures. It will cure you if you are weak.
"Three Classes of Men"
Is a very valuable treatise on tne restora-
tion of manhood. If you are weak, get
it at once. It is free on application, and
will point out a coarse by which you can
become a healthy and happy man.
Found a Cure.
DR. A. T. RANIiEKâ Sir: When 1 re-
ceived your Belt No. 5 on May <>. 1895, I was
in a broken-down condition, tutu physically
and mentally; had no ambition for anything;
could not Bleep well, bad a very poor appetite,
and was always thinking' about my trouble.
After I had worn your belt a month I Was
much . improved, and 1 gradually became
stronger every day, and to-day I am a better
man man I have ever been, and I would ad-
vise every sufferer from similar weak -ess tÂ»
jecure a Dr. Sanden'a Electric Belt. It will
cure without fail. â  -.:

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NFW YORK, N. V., Sept aâ Speculation at
the Stock Exchange dnrlng the early trading was
weak in tone, and in the first half hour or so of
business prices declined anywhere from 14 to 2tsfe
per cent. Manhattan was freely sold. The street
was flooded with rumors that the directors at the
meet to be held later in the day would reduce
tbe dividend because of the poor earnings for the
las quarter. Manhattan's weakness affected tbe
entire list, but the losses were generally confined
to the fractions. Around midday the official an
nouncement was made that tbe directors of the
"Manhattan had declared tbe regular dividend of
1% per cent payable Ociober 1.
The Western Union executive . committee has
also recommended the payment of the regular
quarterly dividend. Another fa able develop
ment was the statement of the Si. Paul road for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896. This report
showed a surplus of $2,618,202 against a deficit of
4302,735 In 18.->5. The directors are to meet late
In the week and act on tliu dividend, and the offi
cials of the American Sugar Refining Company
will also convene for the same purpose within a
day or two.
The developments referred to started up busi
ness In a lively fashion In the last hour of busi
ness, and prices bounded up rapid The ad
vance which followed ranged from % to 2% per
cent.
speculation closed strong with prices at or near
the top figures of the day. Net changes show ad
vances of % to 1% per cent on the day. Total
miles were 191,025 shares. Including 36,100 St.

SOLDIERS' HOME
TROUBLE REOPENED
Veteran Thomas Files New
Charges as a Citi
zen.
SEVERAL ALLEGATIONS.
At a Former Inquiry They Were
Declared to Be Un
founded.
ARE BEING INVESTIGATED
Have Been Referred by the State
Board of Examiners to the
Secretary ot State.
Oaklakd Offici San Fbancibco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 8. J
The trouble over the Soldiers' Home at
Youniville has broken out again, and an
other long list of alleged defections has
been presented to the State Board of Ex
aminers.
A few months ago Lyon Post brought a
lot of charges against the management of
the home, and after an official inquiry the
charges were declared to be unfounded
and the post was suspended for ninety
days lor matting public the charges before
they had been submitted to the depart
ment commander.
ThiÃ time no post has takÂ«n the respon
sibility of attacking the management of
the home, but they have been framed by
one of the best-known veterans of Oak
land, W. R. Thomas of Appomatox Post.
He makes the charges, however, in his
private capacity as a citizen.
The communication filed with the State
Board of Examiners is lengthy, but the
following extracts express briefly the na
ture of the charges :
Your petitioner, upon his information i>nd
belief, represents that, for more than five
years last past, the funds and moneys so ap
propriated for said home, as aforesaid, have
been and are being, from time to time, by the
board of directors of the Veterans' Home As-
Bociatlon, a private corporation (which said
board has assumed the sole and exclusive con
trol, management and application of said
moneys, and the whole thereof) diverted and
mUapplied, to wit:
The sum of $3000, or more, has been and
is being used and applied annually to ihe
payment of salaries of officers of the Veterans'
Home Association and for office rents and in
cidental expenses incurred by said officers in
the City and County of San Francisco and that
all of the offices and the principal place of
business of said Veterans' Home Association, a
corporation, have always been and are located
at and in said City and County of San Fran
cisco except the commandant and medical
director of said home, whose offices are lo
cated at laid home.
That a large percentage of said appropria
tions have been and are being misapplied and
diverted by said board of directors annually in
this: Said funds have been and are being used
in improvements and buildings upon the
grounds of said home and in paying up den
ciences and losses occasioned by said board
and Us officers in their mismanagement and
misapplication of said funds.
That said Veterans' Home Association is and
for a long time has been engaged in conduct
ing and running in its corporate name a sa
loon upon the grounds of said home and in
the immediate vicinity thereof, in which
liquors and beverages in common use in sa
loons are sold and dispensed to the inmates of
said home and others at a large profit to the as
sociation : that the proceeds of said saloon
and the business thereof, and also a large
amount of money derived quarterly from pen
sions paid by the Government to the inmates
of sala home, are paid to and deposited with
the so-called treasurer of said Veterans' Home
Association, and the said moneys derived from
said saloon business and by said association
used and appropriated as its directors see fit;
that said treasurer is under no bond or under
taking tor the sate keeping of said moneys de
rived from said saloon or from said pension! or
any part thereof.
The petitioner concludes by asking Gov
ernor Budd, who is president of the State
Board of Examiners, to order a thorough
investigation.
The charges were read before the board
and referred to the Secretary of State in
order that they might be investigated.
Public Improvements.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. B.â The joint
committees from the Board of Trade,
Merchants' Exchange and Good-roads
Association, and consisting of Messn>.
John A. Britton. J. P. Taylor, W. V.
Witcher, M. J. Keller, Beth Mann, George
Roeth, J. F. W. Schost, D. C. Brown, F.
Sinclair, E. C. Sessions, D. Edwards Col-
Jins and A. D. Pryal, met last evening at
the eas company's office and organized by
selecting Mr. Burton chairman.
The committee is to consider park and
street improvement?, but it will probably
become a permanent organization, with
regular dates for meeting, when subjects
of general interest connected wiih the de
velopment of the city will be discussed.
School Funds.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. B.â County Su
perintendent of i-cbools J. f. Garlick pre
sented to the Supervisors this morning
the following estimate of the minimum
amount of county school money needed
for the ensuing year as rf quired, by sec
tion 1617 of the Political Code of the State :
"Estimated number of teachers 451, at
$500 per teacher, $215,500. Minimum
amount to be raised by county tax: Num
ber of census child ten 28,491, at $6 each,
$170,946. It is therefore my estimate that
$170,046 is the minimum amount of school
money to be raised by the county tax for
the ensuing year."
Officers Elected.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept B.â The annual
meeting of the West Oakland Home was
held yesterday, when the following officers
were chosen: President, Mrs. William H.

Short Holographic Will.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. aâ One of the
shortest holographic wills ever presented
for probate in this county was that of Mrs.
M. A. Kelly, presented to-day by Mamie
A. Grimm. It read :
ALASTZDA, March 20, 1896.
I Mary Ann Kelly, do hereby will- and be
queath to my daughter, Mrs. C. W. Grimm, nee
Mamie A. Kelly, all my real and personal
property. Mes. M. A. Kelly.
A Cano and a Warrant.
OAKLAND. Cal., 6ept. B.â Pedro de
Almeida filed a remarkable communica
tion with Prosecuting Attorney Melvin
this afternoon. Almeida is an officer of
the Portuguese Fiscal Guard and was
formerly Chief of Police of LisDon. He is
a personal friend of Father Gloria of the
Portuguese Catholic Church, and Father
Gloria lent him his valuable cane. An
tonio Pereira, who is a tailor, says Al
meida, circulated the story that Almeida,
who is editor of a Portuguese paper, had |
stolen the priest's cave, and now tne j
editor wants his enemy arrested. Both
men are of considerable prominence in
the Portuguese colony, and the affair has
caused quite a sensation. A warrant for

arrived in the city last evening and went

MORNING BLAZE.
Chief Fair Quite Positive That It Was
of Inoendlarjr Origin.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. B.â Smoke was
discovered issuing from George Cashmore'a
hardware-store on Broadway this morning
about 1-.SO o'clock. A still alarm was
turned in, and when the department
arrived the front door was forced. The
store was filled with smoke as well as the
piano warerooms above. The tire was lo
cated in the basement, where paints are
stored. Some very heavy sacks saturated
with oil were found between some oil
cases. The blaze would have broken out
in a short time more and spread to tbe
oil.
The store was tbe scene of a good sized
conflagration iast April, when the damage
reached $60,000, mostly from water and
the oily smoke. The tire was then sup
posed to have been due to spontaneous
combustion, but Chief Fair is very
emphatic in his declarations that this
time it was incendiary. Mr. Cashmore
said he was at home and in bed when some
one aroused him saying his store was on
fire again.

JOAQUIN IS REPENTANT.
Will Atone for the Past by Stock
ing Fruitvale Heights With
Pheasants.
Numbers of the Handsome Birds Are
Now on the Way From His
Brother's Farm in Oregon.
Oakland Office San Fbanctsco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 8. j
Joaquin Miller has decided to add a
pheasantry to his home at Oakland
Heights. For a long time Mr. Miller has
been anxious to do something for Oakland.
It is an act of repentance on his part for
past sins.
A few months ago Joaquin Miller said
many things about this city of which its
residents did not approve. Among other
things the poet of the Heights compared
its progress to that of the snail. All of
this hurt, and Mr. Miller was replied to
in language which was not at all poetic to
the man of hexameters and petameters.
Now it is reported that he has relented,
and he has contracted with his brother,
George M. Miller, of Eugene, Or., to ship
him enough pheasants to make this part
of the county look more ornamental.
Seventeen beautiful Chinese pheasants are
now on the way, and Joaquin Miller will
turn them loose on his place. It is partic
ularly requested that no one should shoot
them or molest them, as they will soon,
if left alone, scatter all over the hills and
be a very acceptable addition to the birds
of the redwoods.
The birds already on the way are about
half grown and are healthy specimens of
the Chinese pheasant. More will be sent
as soon as they can be caught and shipped.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1896.
LAKE MERRITT A
THING OF BEAUTY
Artist Yelland Submits a
Plan to the City
Council.
ISLANDS AND BRIDGES.
With Driveways and Grass
Plats It Would Resemble a
Parisian Boulevard.
GENERAL DEMAND FOR A PARK
Board of Trade and West Oakland
Improvement Clnb Are Interested
in the Project.
Oaklakd Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 8. )
R. D. Yelland, the artist, has submitted
to tbe City Council and the Board of
Trade an artistic plan for beautifying Lake
Merritt.
The immediate importance of doing
something that will materially add to
Oakland's attractions as a place of resi
dence has been brought forward by the
Board of Trade, the West Oakland Im
provement Club and the City Council,
and it is probable that the new tax levy
will include an appropriation for the
public park, though the details and loca
tion of such have not yet been determined.
Mr. Yelland's idea is clearly set forth in
a large plan which he has prepared and
submitted for the debate of those having
the matter in charge. He calls it "An
Artist's Suggestions for the Improvement
of the Lake in Oakland."
These improvements involve:
The purchase of several acres on Adams
Point for a small park.
A change in the line ol the boulevard to the
rear of this Dark.
The construction of three small islands and
three bridges (for pedestrians only).
The widening of the Twelfth-street dam and
Twelfth street from Oak street to First avenne,
with carriage way and grass plats similar to a
Parisian boulevard.
The purchase of a small park on the east
boulevard and one on the west at the new
bridge.
Points to be filled out Into the lake for tree
planting.
No mention is made by Mr. Yelland
of the cost ot the suggested improve
ments, but the surrounding propertv
owners, who would be the first to reap the
benefit, will undoubtedly accord the pro
ject substantial encouragement.
Lake Merritt and the Piedmont Baths
on the north form one of the prettiest
scenic pictures in the county, and with
the simple, yet artistic, suggestions of Mr.
Yelland the district couFd be made re
markably attractive.
THEY FROWN ON RUSHES
Censure ior Co-Eds Who Carried
Water to the Wounded
Students.
Four Eastern Professors Visiting the
State in the Interest of
National Parks.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. B.â Daylight
"rushes" on the Berkeley campus similar
to the one which took place yesterday aft
ernoon will probably never occur again.
The professors have frowned on the prac
tice, the college daily has condemned the
performance as semi-barbaric, and the
university community ai large has taken
up the matter as a topic for fireside dis
cussion. The freshmen and sophomores
who were tae contestants in the midday
melee received the condemnation of the
faculty at their meeting yesterday, for
cutting recitations and engaging in disor
derly conduct on the campus. But worst
of all the co-eds who participated in the
affair to the extent of cutting loose the
bound and carrying water to and comfort
ing the wounded, received the greatest dis
approbation.
The university daily came out with a
lengthy editorial this morning, in which
the strongest sentiment against the rush
of yesterday was expressed.
In conversation with one of the head
professors to-day, it was learned that a
quietus was about to be put by the presi
dent on daylight rushing within the uni
versity reservation. "The faculty here,"
said he, "are very lenient with the stu
dents. In fact, they are the most lenient
of any of the faculties in tbe first ten uni
versities in America. We do not wish to
come down hard on the students, but we
shall be forced to do so if the scenes of
yesterday noon are reproduced."
Distinguished Visitors Coming.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. B.â The Uni
versity of California will be visited in a
few days by a committee of four distin
guished Eastern professors, who are mak
ing an extended tour of the United States
in the interest of National parks. The
committee consists of Professor C. S. Sar
gent, director of the Arnold arboretum of
Harvard University and Editor of Garden
and Forest; Professor William H. Brewer,
head of ttie department of agriculture at
Yale, and formerly a member of the Cali
fornia Geological Survey; Gifford Pinchot,
forester of Vanderbilt's Biltmore estate in
North Carolina, and Dr. Arnold Hague, a
distinguished Eastern professor of for
estry.
This committee was appointed by act of
the last session of Congress on the recom
mendation of the National Academy of
Science for the purpose of ascertaining
the condition of the various National
forest reservations, and to make a report
which would lead to an act intended for
the more careful preservation of these for
ests. They have already visited Montana,
Idaho, Washington and Oregon and are
now visiting' California. After visiting
Berkeley they will go the Yosemite and
and then switch to the Sequoia and other
small National parks of the State.

Vaccination to Go On.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 8 The Board
of Education at the meeting last night,
settled once for all the much-vexed ques
tion of vaccination in the public schools of
Berkeley. Health Officer Rowell was au
thorized to proceed with his wore:.
It was decided to permit pupils who
have not been vaccinated to defer doing
so until vacation, if desirable. Dr. Rowell
expressed the desire that, whero possible,
the family physician be employed. Oth
erwise, he will do the work free of cost.
Blast Learn Vertical Writing.

THE NEW BATTLE-SHIPS.
An Interesting Question Arises in Relation
to the Awarding of Contracts for
Their Construction.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. B.â A Tribune
special from Washington says: An inter
esting legal question has arisen in relation
to the construction of the recent act of
Congress authorizing the building of tnree
new battle-ships. Four firms have made
application to the Navy Department for
copies of plans of the vessels. These are
the Cramps, the Newport News Company,
the Bath Iron Works and the Union Iron
Works of San Francisco.
The question which has come up is how
many vessels can be built on the Pacific
Coast. The law which authorizes the con
struction of these vessels provides that no
more than two are to be built by any one
private firm or navy-yard. This is held
by some of those to mean that if a Pacific
Coast firm bid for the three ships is the
lowqst that company cannot get the con
tract for more than two. In other words,
that the Did for one of these vessels, al
though less in amount than that of an
Eastern establishment, would have to be
rejected under the law.
The reverse opinion is entertained by
some naval officers, who say that the
lowest responsible bidder, if a private con
cern, may be authorized to build all the
vessels. No special attention is given to
that part of the act which relates to the
construction of vessels in navy yards, as
this is a matter that the SecretarY of the
Navy can regulate in case he "rinds it
necessary to divide the work among the
different stations.
Another clause of the appropriation act
reads that one of the ships may be built
on the Pacific Coast, provided the addi
tional cost to the Government is not
greater than 4 per cent. But this clause
says: "One. ana not more than one ship,
may ba constructed on the Pacific
Coast."
To one not versed in legal technicalities,
this would seem to be explicit in prohibit
ing an award to the Union Iron Works,
for example, of a contract for two or three
of the ships. Yet it is contended by some
officials that, taking the clause referred to
in connection with other provisions of the
act, a different construction can be piaced
upon it.
The question involved is one of much
interest to shipbuilders, of course. It is
now under consideration at the Navy De
partment, and a decision will be made
before the contracts are entered into by
tbe Government, possibly before the bids,
recently called for by Secretary Herbert,
are opened.

WARDALL DENIES
THE ACCUSATION
But J. Taylor Rogers Has
Lost His Blithe
some Air.
BOSS CATOR'S WORK DONE
Legal Objections Against Placing
Fusion Names on the
Ticket.
KINNE HOT LEGALLY NAMED.
Silverites Add Five Names to Their
State Committee and Are
Ready for Action.
THE PRICE OF FUSION.
Far United States Senator, T. T. Cator.
For Collector of the Port at Wilming
ton, E. M. Wardali.
For Postmaster at Freano, John S. Dore.
This is the only visible price that can be
hoped for by the Populists for the muti
lated fusion which has iust been consum
mated in addi.ion to the doubtful honor
of having three weak candidates for Con
gress in ihree hopeless districts. But
these iuture rewards are only birds in the
bush and not in the hand. In return for
empty promises unofficially ma'ie the
Southern Pacific Company has succeeded
in keeping the railroad issue out of poli
tics for the next iour years. The pledge
administered to the candidates to oppose
funding t.je railroad debt is a mere empty
form, for the funding bill will be disposed
of next winter, before the newly elected
Congressmen shall have taken their seats.
The bill would have been passed at the
last sitting of Congress but for the fact
that its passage might have a disastrous
effect upon the prospects of the fusion
ticket just nut up for the Southern Pacific
by George W. Baker, Johu Daggett, Boss
Cator and others of the same political
quality.
The leading Democrats, however, do not
propose to give the Popuiists any collec
torships or postmasterships. The old rule
holds good, "to the victors belong the
spoils," and the Democrats will demand
and will receive all the spoils in the event
01 Bryan's election. Mr. Bryan has since
his nomination announced himself as a
Democrat. He has iudorsed the Chicago
platform and has denounced the People's
party platform at St. Louis as too radical
and as one which he could not conscien
tiously support.
The Populists are not aware of what a
hungry crowd the Democrats are or else
they would cease to dream of collector
ships and postmasterships and would
content themselves with reflecting on the
glory that is theirs to be linked with the
corpse of a party which they denounced
two years ago for being morally and po
litically rotten.
The three parties yesterday finished the
remaining business pertaining to the ac
tion of the conference committee, and
then betook themselves to the considera
tion of ways and means for raising money
with which to carry on the campaign.
It is understood that ihefour non-fusion
candidates, Monteith, McGlashan, Kelly
and Maddux, will experience no difficulty
in having their names placed on the ticket
by the Secretary of State. Should the
chairmen and secretaries of their conven
tions refuse to certify their names a writ
of mandamus will be served upon them
and they will not be able to evade it.
They have been regularly nominated by
regular conventions under the purity of
election law, and no power can keep them
off the ticket.
It is the opinion of many persons well
versed in the law that A. B. Kinne's name
will not be placed on the ticket, the ob
jection being that he was not nominated
by a convention nor by petition as the
law requires. He was nominated by a
certain number of men representing three
different political parties. These men
met, not .as a convention, but as a com
mittee on conference and in secret session,
which is against the spirit ot the purity of
election Jaw. Several members of that
committee had taken part in other con
ventions and had voted for other candi
dates for the same offices, and this being
prohibited by the election law invalidates
all the work of the committee.
Another objection that may be urged is
that whatever changes were made in the
original nominations for the purposes of
fusion were made in pursuance of a cor
rupt and unlawiul bargain and sale propo
sition, wherein one party promises to vote
for certain candidates of the other party
if that other party will vote for certain
candidates of the party of the first part.
Such bargains are prohibited by the spirit
of the law.
A prominent Democrat on being asked
yesterday whether the Populists would get
any of the political patronage, replied:
"Ihey'll get nothing. Didn't we give
them three candidates for Congress?
They'll get left; that's what they'll get."
Chairman Wardali denied yesterday that
J. Taylor Rogers had charged Wardali
with having betrayed him, as stated in
yesterday's Call Mr. Wardali made the
following statement:
"It appeared in the joint committee that
unless we could have seven union candi
dates there would be no union candidates
at all. The committee absolutely refused
to make Mr. Rogers the fusion candidate
in the Fifth District. He failed to obtain
a two-thirds majority of each committee as
required by the plan of action.
"When that fact was ascertained there
remained nothing for the People's p arty
to do except to give the office to the Demo*
crats outright or name some other Popu
list in placÂ« of Mr. Rogers. There being
no available candidate who could be
reached at that moment because t"e last
hour of the comerence by limitation of
the plan of action would expire at mid
night on Sunday, I, on the spur of the
moment, proposed Mr. Kinne and he re
ceived fourteen of th~ fifteen votes, he,
himself, declining to vote. I was acting
under the impression that some subse
quent arrangement could be made by
which Mr. Rogers might be retained, but
at the meeting of the several committees
on the 'ollowing day it was found to be
absolutely impossible to make any change
in any respect whatever, because it had
been determined that the report of the
committee must be approved as a whole
or rejected as a whole, otherwise the whole
scheme of uniting the forces would inevit
ably fail."
Mr. Rogers happened along just as
Chairman Wardali was making the fore
going statement, and in response to a
hypnotic crook of Mr. Ward all's right fore
finger he approached the group with the
air of a crushed tragedian and muttered a
monosyllabic assent to what Mr. Wardali
had said in denial of the report that he
had accused Wardali of having undone
him by mÂ»ans of a false statement. The
cleik of the octopusphobiac Mayor had
jo*t nis jaunty carriage, and if he had no
complaint to make concerning tne manner
in which he had been treated his appear
ance and manner belied that supposition.
John W. Mitchell of Los Angeles, who j
made a gallant fight for Harry Patton,
will not Dour his tale of woe into repor
torial ears, but friends o? his have con
fided to those ears the fact, or what they
say is the fact, that Mr. Mitchell was
nursini: his wrath in secret and that the
proud-spirited Los Angelans would not
vote for a man who lives in a county
where the poor farmers, by reason of Dem
ocratic mismanagement, are obiiged to eat
mush made of middlings instead of the
hot birds on toast promised them by Fakir
Bryan of Nebraska.
The Silverites last night added five
names to their State Central Committee,
and the committee stands as follows: .
Charles D. Lane, Alvinza Hayward, George
W. Baker, William P. Lawlor, F. J. Mnffitt, W.
C. Price, M. A. Hurley, Thomas V. Cator. Wil
liam Pardy, Gabriel Oohn, Dr. W. L. Dicken-
Ron, Hugo Hornlein, Robert McKillican, R. E.
Kelly, James P. Edoff, Dr. E. H. Woolsey, H.
M. Lame, Dr. James I. Stanton, General J. W.
B. Montgomery, W. A. Vann, J. W. Murphy.
George W. Baker was appointed legal
adviser for the committee.
INSURANCE WA S WANDED.
Combined Companies Form a Compact.
Non-Intercourse and Cominiasioii.
The insurance war is over, and a com
pact has been formed that embodies some
sacriiices on the part of many of the com
panies concerned.
The tire insurance underwriters met
yesterday, and with bat three dissenting
votes out of the forty-nine companies rep
resented, the commission amendment
with the following schedule went into
effect for this City : To brokers 16 per cent,
to solicitors 20 per cent, to city agents 20
ana 25 per cent according to whetner the
business in preferred or ordinary.
The rate to Portland. Or., will be 20 per
cent. The rate on interchange between
members will be 15 per cent on preferred
business and 10 per cent on ordinary.
The non-intercourse rule is to be rigidly
enforced.
With these amendments the constitu
tion will now be submitted to representa
tives of the four non-board companies,
who will probably approve, but if tney do
not the constitution will be put into effect
anyway, lor a meeting of the board will be
called to fix a date for the inauguration of
the changes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1896.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE RALLY
The Grand Gathering of Sympa
thizers Set ior To-morrow
Evening.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt. Samuel
M. Shortri-g? and Other Ora
tors Will Sp;ak.
The woman suffrage mass-meeting to
morrow evening at Metropolitan Temple
promises to be a grand affair. All the
ladies of the suffrage bureau have labored
most earnestly to make the opening of
their campaign an event worthy of the
cause which they are striving to aid, and
it looks as though their efforts were to be
crowned with brilliant success.
The programme will include an overture
with organ and orchestra under the direc
tion of Professor Eckmann, the singineof
woman suffrage songs by the Knicker
bocker Quartet and the audience and sev
eral vocal solos.
Among the speakers, the Hon. Samuel
M. Sbortridge will represent the Repub
lican party; Charles Wesley Keed will lift
the banner of Democracy in woman's
cause; Douglass T. Fowler will consider
the subject from a Populist point of view,
and Joseph M. Leggett will judge the
ladies by tne single-tax standard. Dele
gates from the Prohibition, Socialist and
Nationalist parties will also address the
meeting.
But male orators will not have the
whole affair to themselves. Miss Anthony
is to preside, and will be sure to get in a
word ior the cause.
Mrs. Nellie Hoi brook Blinn will deliver
the address of welcome, Miss Anna H.
Shaw will fire a volley of fact, fun and
satire into the enemy's camp and Mrs.
Carrie Chapman Catt. ihe fascinating suf
frage apostle who cnarmed all who heard
her during her recent labors in Idaho,
will take voters and non-voters by siorru.
The doors will be open at 7 o'clock, the
meeting to open promptly at 8. Aurnis
sion will be free, but the body of the
house will be reserved for the gentlemen.
"I'll tell you a secret," said Miss Hay
yet terday, "if you'll promise not to pub
lish it: The end and aim of this meeting

over four times the amount of instruments than
formerly : as I buy for cash and In carload lots

than any other music house In San Francisco.

AMERICAN PROTECTION AND BIMETALLISM.
JUDGE SPENCER
ON THE OUTLOOK
Says Republican Success Is
Next to a Cer
tainty.
SILVER AND FREE TRADE
Can't Understand How a Work
ingman Can Be a Demo
crat
THE NfXT LEGISLATURE.
It Has the Work of Electing a
United States Senator to Do and
Must Be Re-publican.
Judge E. B. Spencer of Lassen County is
in the City stopping at the Russ House.
Judce Spencer is an old Republican war
horse, a member of the Legislature, and a
candidate for re-election, which is the
same as saying that he wiil succeed him
self.
In talking of the political outlook last
evening Judge Spencer said :
"The thing in politics that I have never
been able to understand is how a laborer,
a worker, can be a Democrat. The thing
is inconsistency itself. Now I have been
reading Bryan's SDeeches carefully, and
upon my word it seems to me that they
should cure the â¼'orkers of this country of
any leaning they might have toward
Democracy. There is not a word of argu
ment in them â simply flat statements, un
supported by either reason or fact.
â¢'Mr. Bryan proclaims himself as the
friend of the workingman, and all in the
same breath he declares himself in favor
of giving the work to the foreigner and
opening our mints to foreign silver â to
pay what wages ma\' be earned â at home
here under his pronounced system of free
trade.
"Mr. Bryan is the most pronounced free
trader in the country," continued Judge
Spencer. "He carries the free-trade idea
further than any other man who has given
public utterance on the subject. There is
no doubt in my mind of tbe election of
McKinley. The sober, second thought of
the people is beginning to set in, tbe
country over, and will overwhelm dema
gogism with an absolute certainty. I have
not done much in the campaign yet, but I
am about to get out to work.
â¢'There has been very little agitation up
in the mountain counties as yet. I have
done some considerable traveling in this
State and through Nevada since the open
ing of the campaign and have taken pains
to learn the sentiment of the people and
from all I have seen am convinc d that
the Republicans will poll their full vote in
this Stale. What losses they have sus
tained have had their full compensation in
gains from the opposite party.
"I was over at Reno, New. a short time
ago. It is popularly understood that
everybody in Nevada is for free silver
coinage. Sittinc in the hotel I asked a
Democratic friend how many McKinley
votes would be cast in Reno. He said, 'A
dozen, perhaps â not more than twenty at
the outside.'
"That evening another friend asked me
to attend that evening the formation of a
McKinley club. I did so and discovered
a big crowdâ lso names were subscribed
as charter members. That simply shows
what, reliance may be placed urion the
average Democratic boast. When the
workingman comes to realize that free sil
ver is inseperably linked with free trade
in the tenets of the new Democracy he
will be very caieful of how he vote 3to
perpetuate the current hard times. I cer
tainly expect to see the Republicans carry
this State. Republic an sentiment is grow
ing rapidly. It is necessary that the next
Legislature be Republican on account of
the duty imposed upon that body to elect
a United States Senator.
"The State Senate will be Republican
beyond peradventure on account of the
holdovers, but enough members of the
House are to be added."
Speakine of the progress of the cam
paign Judge Spencer said: "Up in the
mountains, as I have said, very little has
yet been done, but things will soon begin
to warm up. I have beard the speeches
of Congressman McCall, General Barnes
and Hon. M. M. Estee. They were all
gieat speeches, unanswerable in their
arguments. Their effect will spread over
the entire State."
Judge Spencer expects to return north
in a few days and talce an active part in
tne campaign.
REPUBLICAN LEAGUE.
An Enthusiastic Meeting Held Last
Night in the Pioneer
Bulldlnsr.
The Republican National League are
keeping the fires ot Republicanism
brightly burning. Their weekly meeting
at their rooms in the Pioneer building on
Fourth street last night was full of en
thusiasm and replete with stirring music,
speech and song. Tirey L. Ford presided
and was warmly applauded. The National
League Glee Club sang a number of ex
cellent campaign songs, and Miss Mabel
Gruman added much to the entertaining
features of the programme by a recitation,
which was promptly encored.
Not the least interesting of a specially
interesting programme was the personal
testimony of two of Major McKinley'a per
sonal friends â A. R. kannea. tormerly of
Canton, O!;io, and Mrs. George E Snen
cer, who recently came from the East to
California.
Hon. J. A. Stephens made the principal
address of the evening and clearly demon
s.rated the fallacies of the Chicago plat
form, and wrought his audience up to a
high pitch of enthusiasm.
He made it clear that of all men in
America the men who work for wages
should be the last to aid by their votes
the degradation of our financial system.
Coming, as he does, from the State of Ne
vada, he spoke from personal knowledge

of the motives that govern the leaders of
the silver movement and the peculiar
change of heart of Senators Stewart and
Jones. He spoke in high terms of these
gentlemen, personally, but said the crisis
was too grave to follow them into tbe
field of their wild, financial experiments.
He concluded with an earnest and elo
quent appeal to the laborers of San Fran
cisco.
Air. Kanaga told of the early manhood
of McKinley and of his struggle for ad
vancement. At his home his popularity
was greatest among the laboring people,
whose champion he had always been. In
fact, it was the labor vote that repeatedly
elected him to Congress despite an occa
sional gerrymander of his district by a
Democratic Legislature.
Mrs. Spencer graphically portrayed his
heroic self-sacrifice at the National Repub
lican Convention of 1888, when he reso
lutely declined a proffered nomination for
the Presidency which his hish sense of
honor would not permit him to accept
when his State had instructed her delega
tion for another.
Senator Ford closed the meeting with a
few limely remarks, informing the audi
ence that the clubrooms were always open
and extending a cordial invitation to
those present to visit the cluorooms fre
quently, and especially on the Tuesday
evening meetings of the club.
The meeting then adjourned with three
cheers for McKinley and the Republican
party.

DEMOCRATSFORM'KINLEY
Lincoln Club of the Thirty-First
District Gaining Con

Mechanics and Laboring Men Have
Tired of Ceveland sm and Seek
Protection.
In the Thirty-first Assembly District
there is a comparatively new political or
ganization called the Lincoln Club.
Organized scarcely six weeks ago it al
ready has a membership of a little over
300 voters, nearly 25 per cent of whom are
reformed Democrats â mechanics and la
boring men.
"One night we took in seventeen Demo
crats. That was the best single haul
made," said President McCann yesterday.
"But we are getting the boys in right
along; first one will flop and then another.
Some, of course, have been Democrats too
long to give up the party entirely, but
they are all right for protection and Mc-
Kinley at the head of tlie ticket. Let
them favor if they will their old friends
in the precinct that may be running for
office. It is the great principle of protec
tion that we're after and we're workiue
hard to turn the Democrats our way. The
Republicans we're not worryine about, for
they'll come in themselves.
'â¢The membership of the club is made
up of men who know what an honest day's
labor means and who are not afraid of it.
But there are men among them that have
not had employment for many weeks and
they do not need fancy speeches to con
vince them of the difference of times be
fore Cleveland and times under the Demo
cratic rule.
"We're going to meet again Saturday
night in the little hall we use on Ninth
street, near Mission, and we will have
some more Democrats to sien the roll
alter r citations and music by the band.
And, by the way. the boys of the band say
they're going to bring in about thirty new
members at the next meeting.

Washington Hall, 35 Eddy street, con
tained a large and enthusiastic gathering
of the members of the Scandinavian Re
publican Club last night, at which un
bounded enthusiasm for Major McKinley
and the Republican party was manifested.
This : Scandinavian .Republican Club,
which held its first meeting July 2, 1896,
was organized by L. C. Larsen of the well
known firm of Larsen Bros., contractors,
and Vicfgo Konig of the Manhattan, at
151 Fifth street. Since its formation there
has been added to its roils the names of
some of the most prominent Scandina
vians in the City until now it numbers
over 400 members, all of whom have taken
a great interest in the coming campaign,
local as well us National. They believe
that with John D. Spreckels as a leader of
the Republican party in this City the Re
publican party can be made such that all
men having the interest and welfare of
the City at heart can vote for the party
nominees.
The natives of Norway, Sweden and
Denmark who have made the United
States their home have shown their fitness
for American citizenship by conforming
to the laws and customs of their adopted
country. They have not been heard of in
politics before, but this year they are de
termined to make their influence felt on
the side of protection and good govern
ment.
The sentiments as expressed by the
speakers at last night's meeting clearly
showed that the members of the Scandi
navian club are thoroughly well informed
upon the politics of the day.
President Clausen, C. H. Petersen and
Al Olsen spoke on campaign issues, and
L. C. Larsen, the organizer of the Scandi
navian Republican Club, gave a brief his
tory of how the Democratic party treated
the laboring-man in the South.
â¢ The club is now launched forth for the
campaign. It will hold regular weekly
meetings until the day of election.
The officers are :. President, M. -F. Clau
sen : vice-president, Alfred Olsen ; secre
tary, Viggo Konig; treasurer, C.J.Peter

THE HANDBALL COURTS.
Nealon and Bonnet Play a Great Game
Against Champion Riordan
and Lawless.
A great game of handball was played in
the San Francisco court Monday after
noon, the contestants being John Riordan,
tbe coast champion, and Joe Lawless
against J. C. Nealon and T. F. Bonnet.
The game was the best of three and
the play was swift and exciting from the
start. Nealon distinguished himself by
his returns, which were low and hard. He
and his partner lost the final by two aces.
There were several good games at this
court, which were ail marked by close
and exciting finishes. Among them was
a game in which P. T. Donnelly, the ama
teur champion, and J. Riley played against
C. McNulty, T. Walsh and W, Riley witii
the rubber ball and won.
The event of the day at the Union court
was a game in ' hich the old-time rivals
participated. R. Leniban and J. Nelson
turned the tables on J. J. Feeney and
Terry McManus, the heavy-weight cham
pion, winning tbe final of the great
struggle by four acos.
Another game that aroused great inter
est was the contest between Billy Gal
lagher and Harry .Yin neck against Dick
McCradie and Dr. Caliahan, the two
latter winning.
Several interesting games were played
at the Mission Athletic Club court Tom
Barry, the manager, challenges the Eu

Met in a Parlor.
A parlor meeting in the interest of woman
suffrage was held this afternoon at the resi
dence of Mrs. Frank L. Whitney, on the corner
of Sacramento and Laguna streets. The large
parlors were filled with representative and in
tellipent women. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,
the distinguished speaker from New York,
spoke to the audience for over forty minutes.
She spoke of the ballot in the hands of women
as being a great power for good in counteract
ing existing evils. Altogether it was a very
successful meeting.
INCENDIARY OR CHANCE?
A Theory That the Stoneman
House, Yosemite, Was Set
on Fire.
Commissioners Will Investigate, and
Then P.' an for Some Temporary
Buildings.
Guardian Galen Clark of the Yosemite
Valley thinks that the Stoneman House,
recently entirely destroyed by fire, was
lost to tbe State by the act of an incen
diary.
The first reports, it will be remembered,
attributed the cause of the fire to faulty
flues and crevices in the brick chimneys.
The official public reports on file in the
office of the secretary of the Yosemite
Commissioners tell a very different story.
At one point in his account of the de
struction of the State property the
guardian says:
"The flues of every chimney were thor
oughly lined with sheet steel tubing from
the fireplaces below to some three or four
feet above the chimney and capped with
spark-extinguishing boards. It is my
opinion that the tire never originated
from accident, but was purposely set by
some unknown person. He also de
clares that there had been no fires in the
furnaces since the day before. When the
hotel was formally closfd for the season.
This is all he Bays about the cause of
the fire, but the Board of Yosemite Com
missioners will meet in this City next
Monday, when Governor Budd will be
present to engage in further inquiries into
this supgestive report and also to consult
as to what arrangements shall be made to
provide proper accommodations for tour
ists visiting the valley next season.
The Commissioners have let the con
tract for two new bridges in the valley to
T. G. McCandlish of Coulterville, the
lowest bidder, and he has already started
on the work of construction. One bridge
is to span the Merced River at the Cas
cades in the lower end of the va.ley, and
the other will be built near Bridal Veil
Fail. The cost of the two bridges will be
$1570. They will be completed by Oc

CALIFORNIA IN FRONT
What Chris Ryer Observed on
a Visit to Democratic
Mexico.
LABOR'S PAY IS LOWEST THERE
Only Twenty Cents a Day for Work
end Four Dollars a Day for
Room Rent
The work of Secretary Higgins and of
his clerk, Jake Steppacher, of the Repub
lican State Central Committee, has in
creased so much within tbe past week that
they are now obliged to labor fourteen
hour 9 per day with the voluminous mass
of correspondence pouring in from all
parts of the State.
These letters show that Republicanism
is gaining strength in every quarter every
day, farmers and business men realizing
that protection is what is needed in the
United States to start and keep the wheels
of the factories moving. All other so
called issues are merely makeshifts along
side this one.
Visitors from the interior tell the same
story. C. T. Carlston of Merced says that
the necessity for protection is fully recog
nized in that county, one of whose chier
industries under Republican administra
tions was wool raising and which indus
try was ruined by the operation of the
Democratic tariff. The majority of these
sheep-owners were Democrats, but they
declare now that they will vote for McKin
ley and protection.
J. C. Gibson of Templeton, San Luis
Obispo County, says that the RepuoJicans
of that part of the country are all right in
their devotion to the cause of home rule.
They believe that the United States should
cease to be tne dumping ground for the
pauper-made poods of Europe.
Chris B. Ryer, a representative of a
wholesale house in this City, recently ar
rived from thi City of Mexico whither he
bad gone with Mrs. Ryer for the purpose
of engaging in business in that free-coin
age country.
What lit found there was very discour
aeing: to the spirit of enterprise. Of the
425,000 inhabitants of the City of Mexico
he tound that about 300,000 are beggars or
peons workinp for twenty cents per day
Mexican money. Owing to cheap silver
prices of everything except labor are about
twice os high as they are in the United
B ta'es.
This fact was strikingly illustrated on
the train on which Mr. and Mrs. Ryer
traveled from San Francisco to El Paso.
Nine dollars was the charge for a berth in
a Pullman coach. After the train crossed
into Mexico $18 in Mexican money was
charged for the same distance.
On the buffet-car before crossing the
border into Mexico a glass of lemonade
cost 15 cents. Alter entering Mexico the
same glass of lemonade on the same car
costs 30 cents in Mexican money.
A room at a hotel without board costs
from $2 to $4 per night.
Meals cost twice as much as they do in
San Francisco. In other words, prices
have been raised to equal the difference
between the bullion value and the coin
value of silver.
Mr. Ryer saw a large number of Ameri
cans at the American legation in Mexico,
among them M. F. Tarpey, Democratic
National com tnittecman from this Slate.
They were investing in silver mines,
which will be valuable property should
free coinage be adopted by the United
States. Inthatevei:t a large number of
men now in moderate circumstances will
become multi-millionaires.
John A. Si eehan of the firm of Sheeban
& Harris, proprietors and editors of the
S icramemo News, was in the City yester
day with good tidings from that county.
The working people there, and they com
pose the great mass of the people, are tor
McKinley. They believe, and rightly, too.
that protection tends to keep wages up
and to elevate the standard of living.
POLITICS AT STOCKTON.
Six Democratic Candidates for
the Senate to Stand T. V.
Cator Off.
The State Committee to Run Four In
stead of Sixty Interior "Openings"
Saturday Night.
Chairman Alford and several of the
active Democrats who run State politics
from the in9ide, went to Stockton yester
day, and to-day and to-morrow there'll be
large politics done up there while the
bands p!ay on Admission day and the
headquarters at the California Hotel
gather dust.
Frank Gould, Gavin McNab, Chairman
Alford, Governor Budd, Steve White and
a long list of those fellows who are wheels,
cranks, safety valves and piston rods in
the Btate machine will unbutton their
vests, order another with straws and en
deavor to accomplish fusion of ideas.
It is understood that one of the fields
that will be worked while the populace at
large is given over to innocent joy? is that
of Legislative fusion with the Populists.
Frank Gould is chairman of this Legisla
tive and Congressional Committee, and
the other members are Gavin McNab,
Governor Budd, Stephen M. White, W.
W. Foote and James G. Maguire.
Every last one is a candidate for the
United States Senate, and so they are all
supposed to be ready to hustle for tae said
Legislative fusion like a black-and-tan
after a woodchuck. This committee is
quietly engaged in watching T. V. Cator,
the great Legislative fusionist of the day,
and in engineering, stimulating or re
pressing Popocratic district attractions.
There'll be lots of the county politicians
at . Stockton. Fusion on Assemblymen
and Senators has already been accom
plished in several districts, and other deals
are in progress. Some of the State lead
ers also expect to take advantage of the
warm spots in iome Democratic hearts up
there and secure a few bits for the State
campaign fund that is yet an empty
dream.

Democracy is suffering is not the only evi

dence of the apathy of the Democratic
campaign. One of tae great initial pians
of the campaign has just slumped into
dismal failure.
Ten days ago the speakers' committee,
Chairman Alford and a few other leaders
met and formed and announced the bril
liant plan of having a great interior
"opening" of the campaign. There were
to be mass-meetings on the evening of tbe
12th inst. at every county seat in the State
and several other important centers.
On that evening there was to be one
blaze of campaign enthusiasm from Sierra
to San DieÂ«o. At some sixty mass-meet
in cs an army of orators and legions of
Democratuiists were to raise a glorious
chorus.
The committee has just four mass-meet
ings arranged for the 12th inst. It hopes
to bend out two more speakers on that
night.
Eugene N. Deuprey of Ban Francisco
will speak at Petaluma, W. P. Straaley of
San Francisco at Salinas, Frank D. Nichol
of Stockton and C. C. Wricht of LO3
Angeles at San Bernardino. Stephen M.
White speaks at San Jose Friday evening,
and he may speak at Valiejo Saturday
night. Congressman Maguire will go East
on legal business to be gone a week, and
he will not be available.
Lectures on Socialism.
The Jewish section of the Socialist Labor
party was addressed at its headquarters last
night at 970 Folsom street by Leo Gasser, on
"The Attitude of Wage-Earner3 to Socialism."
Rev. J. E. Scott will speak to-night (Wednes
day) at the Turk-street Temple at the mass
meeting to be held by the Liberty Branch of
the Socialist Labor party. His topic is one
that promises a large audience, as* he will
spean on "Some Reasons Why I am a Social
ist."
While traveling with a wagon load of social
ist literature to the Union Ironworks Mon
day evening the horse ana wagon were driven
into the dumps instead of over the bridge
which spans the portion over which the
wagon should have journeyed. The occupants
were thrown out, but no one was hurt.
Zang, the Wife-Beater.
Charles Zang, engineer in a stoneyard at
Fourth and Townsend streets, appeared In
Judge Low's court yesterday to answer a
charge of battery upon his wife Sophie. He
was surrendered into custody by his bonds
men. He then asked for a continuance till to
morrow, and it was granted. On Friday
night he choked his wife so hard that she had
to be taken to the Receiving Hospital. He
has been several times arrested for the same
offense.
