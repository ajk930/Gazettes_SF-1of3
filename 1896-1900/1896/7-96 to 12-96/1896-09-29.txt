COMPLETION OF CONGRESS.
Republican* to JB.are n Safe Working Ma
jority in the Houne. ,
â¢ WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 28.â The
first rough estimate of the -political com
plexion of the next House of Representa
tives h*as been made at the Republican Con
gressional headquarters, though care is
taken that the estimate shall not be con
sidered as an official statement issued by
the committee. According to this state
ment there can be no reasonable doubt
that the next House will be Republican,
though it is conceded that it is not ex
pected that the phenomenal and at times
unwieldy majority of the present House
will be retained. From the figures now in
the hands of the committee a modest ma
jority of only seven is claimed, but a study
of the States will show that in every case
there has been claimed only the lowest
possible number of representatives. Thus
in Indiana, which is now represented in
the House by a full delegation of thirteen
Republicans, only nine members are
claimed. Similarly only twelve Republi
cans are claimed for Ohio, though there
are at present nineteen Republicans in the
House. A spirit of extreme conservatism
has been maintained throughout, and the
outlook is accordingly that the first official
statement issued by Chairman Babcock
will.be far more liberal in its claims. The
following condensed statement will Â«-how
where the Republicans hope to win their
representatives:
Alabama. 1 Maine 4
Connec.lcut 4 New Hampshire 2
Delaware , ... 1 New Jersey..-. 7
Illinois 12 New Yoric 32
Indiana. 9 North Carolina. a
lowa li Ohio. 12
Kansas 4' Oregon 2
Maryland 4; Pennsylvania......... 26
Massachusetts ...IS Tennessee . 2
Michigan 8 Rhode Island ".".".". 2
Minnesota 5 Wrmont . . 2
MisÂ«uri...^ 3 West Virginia '. 2
Nebraska. 5 Wisconsin. 9
Kentucky- 6
A total pf 186.
The conservatism of this claim will be
conceded Dy every one. Nothing has been
claimed in th* statement from the Pacific
Coast, though it is believed that Califor
nia, for instance, will send, no less than
five Republicans to the next House. Nor
are any members claimed from Nevada,
Utah, Washington,. Idaho, Wyoming,
North and South Dakota, South Carolina
or Virginia, all of widen have Republican
representatives in the present House. It
is still early for even an approximately
accurate forecast, out the foregoing state
ment shows beyond a doubt that the
House will have a safe working majority
lor the Republicans. * t 'â¢ :

Generals Alger, Howard, Stewart, Sickels
and Corporal Tanner reached here this
afternoon and spoke to a large gathering
of enthusiastic auditors. The party
reached Dubuque from the west before
daylight and were welcomed by a large
number of citizens. They remained
quietly in their car until 9:30 o'clock,
when they were driven to Washington
P&rk, where they spoke for two hours.
Hundreds of excursionist-; from neighbor
ing towns came on morning specials, and
it is estimated that 10,000 people were in
line.
Senator Allison, Congressman Hender
san and Governor Drake joined the party
here. Congressman Henderson presided
at the meeting and addresses of welcome

tional Committee than on any previous
day. Among the callers at Republican

Executive Corumitteemen Afanley, Scott
and Clayton. The colonel has just com
pleCed a trip through Indiana. Illinois,
lowa and other middle Western States.
"Indiana is certaia to go for McKinley."
said Colonel Conger. "I make the predic
tion that at least 30,000 sound-money
Democrats who are intending to support
Palmer and Buckner will, rather than
waste half their ammunition, vote straight
for McKinley and Hobart. I expect to see
McKinley carry the State by from 20 000 to
30,000." . ' '
''â¢What of Illinois?"
"McKinley will carry it by upward of
50,000. A month ago there was certainly
a very strong free-silver sentiment there
but since then there has been a tremen
dous revulsion. The resentment against
Aitgeld and Altgeldism is growing daily
more intense." â¢

PARIS. Fbakck. Sept 28.â A dispatch
to tbe Temps from Constantinople says
that M. Cambon, tbe French Embassador,
has informed his colleagues that during
his audience with the Su'.tan on Friday
last he acquainted his Majesty with the
uneasines* that the recent unchecked an
archy in Constantinople caused in Europe.
He declared that a repetition of the dis
order would lead Europe to intervene, in
consequence of the danger to which for
eigners would be exposed. He advixed
rbe Sultan to exercise c emency, to bring
about the pacification of the Armenians
and to differentiate tbe peaceful masses
from the revolutionary element.
M. Cambon further stated that he had de
manded the release of thousands of inno
cent persons who were in prison, the con
voking of the Armenian Assembly for tbe
election of a patriarch and tbe execution
of the reforms that had been promised by
his Majesty. It is stated that the Sultan
promised to convoke the assembly and to
extend the promised reforms to the whoie
empire.
LONDON, Enq., Sept. 28.â The Daily

they were plotting with the heir to the
throne and his brother, the ex-Sultan
Murad, to depose him.
Lord George Hamilton, Secretary of
State for India, has written a letter on the
Turkish question, which will be published
to-morrow. An extract from this letter
is believed to be indicative of Great
Britain's view on the subject. Tne writer
says that Turkey can be kept together and
that her dissolution must result in the ag
grandizement of Russia, whose vassal the
Sultan now virtually is.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Tubkey, Bept. 28.
The Porte nas issued a statement rejoicing
at the apparent reaction in some of the
London newspapers against the excessive
anti-Sultan agitation in Great Britain,
which it declares is answerable for the
terror in Constantinople, the foreign resi
dents naturally fearing tbe wrath of the
Mussulmans at the insults to the Sultan
uttered by tbe speakers at the public meet
ings and by the journals of Kneland. The
statement continues:
'Despite their organized agitation, vitu
peration and clamorous provocation ema
nating from London, tbe Porte has suc
ceeded, by dint of energy and watchful
ness, in proving to Europe that the alarm t
of its English inaulters is unfounded. The j
Porte does not associate the British na
tion, for which it nas the highest regard,
with the agitation of a few hot-brained
politicians who are led astray by their
passions. The moderation of the Euro
pean nations will, far mar* than the
rociferation oi England, help the Porte to
protect foreigner* and Turkish subjects in
the capital against the plots of Armenian
revolutionists'."
TELEGRAPHERS TO STRIKE
All the Train-Dispatchers on the
Canadian Pacific Are
Called Out.
An Order That Hay Tie Up the Rail
road From the Atlantic to
the Pacific.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Sept 28.â A1l the
train dispatcher* on the Canadian Pacific
Railway system were ordered out on
strike tonight by T. M. Pierson, second
assistant grand chief of the Order of Kail
way Teles vaphers. The strike is the result
of an alleged grievance on the part of the
dispatchers.
Pierson arrived here a few days ago and
met the members of the committee repre
senting this branch of railway employes.
At his suggestion the members of the
committee waited npon the assistant
general manager and the vice-president
of the Canadian Pacific Railway. They
formulated their grievances, which cover
grounds from the smallest to the most
important items. There are in many
cases demands for increased pay or state
ments that the former rate had been re
duced. The deputation was not received
by the two officers named, who claim
that the elementary agreement between
the company and the men had been
broken, inasmuch as the complaint from
any certain district should first of all be
referred to the division superintendent in
charge of that portion of the system, and
then, if satisfaction is not received from
him, to the general superintendent and so
on to the president himself.
An effort was made to reach an amica
ble settlement to-day, but without avail,
and at 9 o'clock to-nieht Assistant Grand
Chi-f Pierson ordered all agents, dis
patchers and operators on the system
who are members of the order to strike.
The order, it is claimed by Pierson, will
affect over 700 men and will involve the
Canadian Pacific Railway system from
coast to -coast.
TORONTO. Oitt., Sept. 28â While it is
not known yet to what extent the order
will be applied in this division there is a
feeling that the situation is critical and
the strike may extend to other branches
of the employes. The conferences at Mon
treal with the division officers have been
carried on all evening. At midnight a
dispatcher here and one at Toronto Junc
tion went out It is claimed that the
strike will not affect the passenger service
and that on morning trains operators will
go out *o fill any gaps which have been
made. A total extent of the movement
cannot be estimated to-night

BAR HARBOR, Ms., Sept. 28.â Hon.
vV. C. Whitney, former Secretary of the
Navy, will be married at St. Sauvenrs
Episcopal Church here to-morrow to Mrs.
E. S. Randolph of New York, to whom he
was reported to be engaged last summer.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Sept. 28.â T. J.
Reagan, private secretary to William. C.
Whitney, to-night confirmed the Bar
Harbor (Me.) dispatch to the
United Associated Presses which an
nounces that the ex-Secretary would be
married to-morrow to Mrs. Edith Ran
dolph. Mrs. Randolph is the widow of
Captain Arthur Randolph of the Fifteenth
Hussars, "Queen's Own" regiment, of
England.
The wedding is to take place at noon to
morrow, almost immediately following
the promulgation of the engagement,
as Mr. Whitney hoped thereby to
avoid any unnecessary prominence
being given to the affair. The chief
reason for this is because of the death a
few days ago of ex-Senator Henry B.
Payne of Ohio, the father of the late Mrs.
Whitney. Only half a dozen friends have
been invited. The bride and groom will,
it is said, remain at Bar Harbor in
definitely.
Harry Payne Whitney and his wife,
who have just been married, will not at
tend the wedding, as they are to leave
Lenox for Yokohama, Japan. Mr. and
Mrs. A. H. Paget. the latter
Mr. Whitney's daughter, are now
in the Adirondacks, and because of
the expected illness of Mrs. Paget, neither
will be able to be at Bar Harbor. The
guests who have been invited have not
been made known by Mr. Whitney
or Mrs. Randolph. Mrs. Randolph
before her marriage to Captain
Randolph was Edith 8. May of the May
family of this city and Baltimore. Mrs.
Randolph is a first cousin of Herman
Oelrichs and of Mrs. William Jay, wife of
Colonel Jay.

Registrar Hinton Calls Major MeLaughlin's Atten

in the Matter.
At a late hour last night Registrar Hin
ton announced that he would file as tne
regular Republican ticket the municipal
ticket nominated by the Auditorium Con
vention last Saturday night.
He announced further that he would
hold the nominations of Assemblymen
and Senators in abeyance for the present,
as he bad not yet made up his mind con
cerning them.
The conference of the executive com
mittee cf the Republican State Central
Committee announced to take place at 2
o'clock yesterday afternoon for the pur
pose of considering the application of
Martin Kelly and Senator Mahoney to be
allowed to break their way into the Re
publican party did not occur. The com
mittee met and, at the request of Major
McLanghlin, adjourned without taking
any action.
It was decided to refer the matter to the
State Central Committee, which will meet
at 2 o'clock this afternoon.
Chairman Thomas D. Riordan of the
Republican County Convention yesterday
filed the certificates of the candi
dates of the convention with Registrar
Hinton and asked to have them
placed on the official ballot. Mr. Hinton
replied that he would take the matter
under advisement until 5 o'clock in the
afternoon, he being desirous of consulting
his attorney. At the hour named Messrs.
Thomas D. Riordan. J. Alva Watt, An
drew Branch, W. W. Bansman and Secre
tary Ricard called npon the Registrar.
The Registrar said that he was not then
ready to do anything in the matter. He
added:
"I have been so busy with the matter
that I have not had time to take my
meals. I will say, however, that what
ever my decision will be it will be upon
the merits of the case as it stood when it
was submitted to me, without regard to
anything which may have happened since
that time. Mr. Spear has filed with me a
request that I place npon the ticket the
names of >be Assemblymen nominated
from the Fourth Congressional District.
He says that the Republican County Com
mittee had no authority because it was
created by the municipal convention."
Mr. Riordan laughed sarcastically at this
claim.
"If you wish I will discuss that ques
tion," said Mr. Watt.
Mr. Watt then made the following state
ment:
The County Committee whioh created this
convention is the successor of the convention
of 1892. We can go back through a long series
ot years with the same result. In 1892 the
convention doubled the County Committee
that was elected. That was the convention
which Martin Kelly and Phil Crimmins were
supposed to control. The committee con
tinued in existence until 1894.
Just about that time Colonel Dan Burns
made bis appearance in municipal politics,
and secured control of the County Committee
and laid Kelly and Crimmins on the shelf.
Colonel Burns enlarged the committee, and
that committee called a convention in 1894,
which met and elected a County Committee
for the succeeding two years. The committee
so elected has continued in existence until
this time and is still in existence, and no
question whatever as to the legality or regu
larity of these committees or conventions has
been raised.
We are the regular successors of the pre
ceding County Committee. Our County Com
mittee called this convention this year in
accordance with the precedent, not only of the
Republican party but of all the parties. We
held primaries in the usual manner and the
call adopted for this convention was precisely
the same as that of two years ago, the validity
of which no one questions. The same prece
dents were adopted and the ticket was elected
in the same manner.
"On what ground did. Michael Henry
get in his work with the National Com
mittee â I mean M. H. de Young?" said
Mr. Hinton.
"That is another story," replied Mr.
Watt, "it is municipal politics we are
talkine about now. So far as their right
to nominate Congressmen and Presiden
tial electors is concerned in the Fourth
District there is no dispute. They were
right in that matter as well as in the Fiftb
Congressional District. In that district,
after we had finished the business for
which the convention had been called, we
adjourned. The Fourth District Conven
tion, instead of doing likewise, assumed
to constitute a municipal convention."
Mr. Watt continued and explainei that
the certificate from the National Commit
tee recognizing the Fourth Congressional
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
District Convention did not confer any
power npon that convention. It merely
recognized it as the proper Congressional
convention from that district. Ho said:
Now.'l understand that the other side pre
tends that a Joint meeting of the Fourth and
Fifth Congressional districts had been called,
but I dnny that. I urn chairman.of the Fifth
District Convention, and since it made its
no miii at ions I have never called a meet
ing. I was never requested to call
a meeting of that convention and I know that
no such meeting was ever held. Nobody but
I could hay â¢ called it, because it had ad
journed subject to Vie call of the chair. So I
repeat it that there never was a joint meeting
of the two Congressional districts.
But that is not the ground of our contention
here. We are the legitimate and regular suc
cessors of the County committees for' gen
erations past in this City. 41r. Mahoney,
now with Mr. Kelly as one of the leaders of
the opposition, went to the meeting which
two years ago created this County Committee
'.and had a good deai to say in naming a lot of
the members of that committee.
"It was Mahoney and his tactics that
sent Sternberg and Day across the bay,"
suggested Secretary Ricaid.
Mr. Watt continued to argue that every
nomination in every county in this btate
was made through the jurisdiction of the
County Committee, and if the Congres
sional conventions had the right to make
county nominations then there has not
been a legal nomination made in any
county in the State.
Said Registrar Hi nton: "I am getting
this matter in hand and I will write a
reply to Major McLaughlin to the effect
that I will decide this matter irrespective
of what may have taken place since the
application to file this certificate was pre
sented to me."
The gentlemen then withdrew.
Major McLaughlin addressed the fo now
lowing letter to Mr. Hintoa as a represent
ative of the State Central Committee and
in the interest of fairness, with a desire to
see that justice should be done to both
sides of the controversy:
Hon. William M. Hinton, Registrar of Voters,
CUyâDzA.& Sib: It is doubtless well known to
you that there are in session' in this City at
the present time two Republican municipal
conventions. Under the ltrtv of tnls State it is
your duty beyond question to decide
which of the certificates of nomina
tion that will - be presented to you
by said conventions snail be tiled. lam fully
aware that there can be but one Republican
municipal ticket on the official ballot, and
that you must determine, in case of contest,
which nominations snail compose that ballot.
I assure you that it is far from my purpose
to attempt to influence you in any way in de
termining this important point. Your stand
ing in this community, both personally and
officially, forbids even the thought and would
do great injustice both to you and to myself.
I am actuated in addressing you by moires
of fair dealing only. It is my duty as chair
man, of tne Republican- .State. Central Com
mittee to harmonize, if possible, all the differ
ences in the party. I have endeavored to
perform that duty in this instance, and, in so
doing, requested both conventions to cease
their deliberations, and (o endeavor to come
to some amicable agreement whereby party
unity could be restored and consequently but
one certificate of nomination be presented to
you for filing.
In accordance with my request, one of said
conventions adjourned until Monday night,
the 28th inst., and therefore cannot present to
you for filing Its* 'certificate of nominations
before Tuesday, tne-29th inst. The represent
atives of said convention have petitioned me
to request you to withhold tfife filing of any
certificate of nominations by the opposing
convention, should one be > resented t<t you,
until Tuesday, the 29th inst.
Under the circumstances that I have de
scribed, it is but just that I accord to them
their request. In doing so Ido not intend in
any way, were such a thing possible, to- influ
ence you in the least degree in your decision
regarding which one of the conventions is the
legal one and entitled to have its certificate of
nomination filed.
I only ask tuat you delay the determination
of this matter until both certificates of nomi
nation are submitted -to you, which, lam re
liably informed, will not be later than Tues
day, the 29th inst. Very respectfully,
Frank McLaughlin, Chairman.
Registrar Hinton's action was of itself a
reply to this communication, and showed
that the Registrar had already made up
his mind to recognize the nominations as
those of the regular Rerublican party.
The following is Mr. Hinton's reply :

N&WYORK. N. V., Se.pt. 28.âCandi
date; Bryan's journey from New London
to New York was interesting chiefly by
his reception at New Haven and his pub
lic comment while there on the trouble
the Yale studeats cave him the other day.
As if to show Mr. Bryan how many peo
ple in the old college town disapproved of
the annoyances which he suffered at the
hands of the students, New Haven people
gathered in force at the railroad station to
Bee fhe Presidential candidate. Several
thousand were present as ihe train came
.to a ,stapdstill. The cheering was very
hearty as he appeared and the few re
marks he made were roundly applauded.
â  Mr. Bryan said :
I entered New England when 1 entered Con
necticut, and I will leave New England when'
.1 leave Connecticut to-night. My visit has
' been a very pleasant one And 1 shall carry
away with me only agreeable recollections.
"There are no Yale students here to
day', Mt. Bryan," called out somebody in
the crtfwd.
>"Do i not criticise the boys so harshly,"
"said Mr. Bryan; "I am not inclined to
icnticise them as severely es some others
.have, I have been a college' boy myself, ]
and 1 am inclined to attribute their inter- :
ruption more to youthful exuberance than I
to any deliberate- intention to interfere ;
with free speech. [Cheers.] I shall always i
be glad to return to New Haven when cir- <.
cnmstauces will permit, and 1 am sure [
that whatever may be my. subject I will i
be able to find persons here who are j
willing t<> listen even tf they do not agree.
[Great applause.] I am glad to notice

The trairn remained at New Haven five i
minutes only, and" as it drew out of the
' station an enthusiastic yell went up Iroiu
the assemblage.
IÂ£ was 3r20 o'c'ojok when Mr; Bryan
reached Brfdgepsrt, twenty mi-nutes iatpr. \
A gdQd sized crowd was there, and Mr.
Bryan was oheered. Mcc cheers came at ;
'Stamford, where quite a- throng was gath- '
ered.
Mr. Bryan arrived at the Hotel Bar- i

about (he hotel and cheered ihe-oandiiiate '
heartily. â¢ â  . * .

Mr. Bryan remained at the Barthoidi |
â  less than an hour. Shortly before 6 j
o'clock he Marted for New Jersey.
, â¢ PATERSON.N. J.. Sept. 28. --William \
' J. Bryan was received by a crowd of 20,000
. people in this city to-night. It was one of
â¢' the noisiest and hardest crowds to control
that Mr. Bryan has faced thus far in the
campaign. The candidate arrived from
. New. Yorjfc at 6:53 and was met- at the
depot by a committee and escorted in a
carriage" to the speaker's stand on Coates
Hill,, about which an immense throng
gathered. Just as the carriage appeared
the horses became frightened at bursting
bombs and- plunged forward. The crowd
became almost panic-stricken. They could
not fallb ack owing to the solid wali of
human beings behind. Two policemen
jumped ior-ward and grasped the bridles,
holding ths horses in check before any
damage was done. Witn much difficulty
Mr. .Bryan was pushed upon the plat
form. .The crowd was very noisy and it
' was impossible* to secure silence for over
fifteen minutes.
When quiej was restored Mr. Bryan was
introduced by Munson Force, chairman
of .the . Democratic County Committee.
Mr. Bryan discussed the money question
at great length. .

The party -was taken to the Hotel Sey

pared Mr. Bryan tried to get a little more
sleep. At 7:30 o'clock Mr. Bryan and
Mr. ; Bewail left the Hotel j Seymour ' for
Highland square, where the Presidential
candidate spoke. Despite the early hour
.a 'great crowd . had gathered there. % Mr.
Bryan was introduced by John Driscoll
and made a half-hour speech. Mr. Bryan
said in part:
: Our opponents are all the time asserting
that business men ought to take an interest in
this campaign in order to protect, their busi
ness interests. It has always made me indig
nant that a lew people in each community
should assume to bÂ« the only business people
. in it and should always insist upon thrusting
their business Interests forward in preference
to anybody else's business interests. I have
always believed that any one who contributed
to a nation's prosperity, who added to a na
tion's wealth or to a nation's greatness, was a
business man. [Applause.] " Sometimes our
opponents try 10 array the waÃe-eHrnin*
classâ they who work in 'factories or ; by the
day for an employerâ against the .farming
classes. I want to show you that you cannot
separate the interests of the wage-earning
classes from the interests of the farming
classes. You don't produce shoes for orna
ment, but for wear. â 
People cannot wear shoes until they are able
o buy shoes and they cannot buy shoes unless
they have the money to buy with, and they
cannot get money to buy shoes with until they
sell something they have and get that money.
Now, you sell shoes to people West and South.
If you drive down the price of all those things
which the farmers produce so that when they
sell their crops they cannot more than pay
their debts and interest and taxes, what money
will they have to buy shoes with? Are you go
ing to add to the prosperity of Lynn by mak
ing more people go barefoot? [Cries of "No,
never."] The wage-earners of Lynn will be idle
until there is a demand for the products of the
factories of Lynn, and there can be no demand
for that product as long as you drive money
up and property down. ;
Falling pricesâ hard times, and hard times
have never been advocated in a platform by
any party, although the Republican platform
this year, without directly saying so, promises
to continue times hard and make them
harder. [Applause.] Do you deny that propo
sition? I want you to look at that platform.
It declares a gold standard is not desirable be
cause the party pledges itself to get rid of it.
If the double standard is not more desirable
than tha gold standard why does the Republi
can party want to make any change? If the
gold standard is good we ought to keep it, but
when the Republican party attempts to get rid
of it it admits it is not as good as bimetallism.
But they promise you, notwithstanding their
desire to get rid of the gold standard, that they
will keep it until other nations help us to get
rid of it. Until then they say we must maintain
the gold standard [A voice: "Yes, but we
won't." [No, I aon't think we will myself.
If we maintain the gold standard we must
maintain those things which are necessarily
attached to it. We must maintain this system
of issuing bonds to buy gold whenever we
want gold. When we issue bonds and buy
gold we create a demand for gold and raise its
purchasing power throughout the world, but
we are contracting our currency by piling it
up in the vaults at Washington when it ought
to be out doing business among the people.
[Applause.]
You manufacturers and merchants go to the
banks for money. The banks tell you they
are very sorry they cannot loan any more ju-t
now. There c-ui be no more in this country
than the people permit. If you make your
laws so you draw a part of the money, out of
circulation and lock it up you cannot use it in
your business and have it in the vaults at
Washington at the same time.
That looks plain enough. Yet there are
financier* who go on the theory that the more
money you take out ot circulation the more
you have left in it. [Applause.] There are
financiers who actually r.jotc d ai the issue of
bonds, and said it would restore confidence.
They are trying to run business in this coun
try with a larger and larger percentage of con
fidence to the amount of money on hand
[laughter], and if tbey go on the people will
have all the confidence and no money.
[Laughter.]
There is only one place where they think the
confidence game won't work. You go to one
of these men who is all the time talking about
confidence and ask him to loan money. lie
"What security have you?" You say,
"I will give you ail the confidence you want. 111 1
He will tell you he is not loaning on confi
dence this year. [Laughter.) \
Why is it the financiers are so anxious for
you to have confidence in them when they
dont' have any confidence in you? They want i
security and tell you to get a good name on
your note or put something up that is sala
ble.' The troub.e is that thiugs'that used to
be salable are not so any more. Security that
used to be good is not good security any more.
They are driving down the value of . your se- i
curity by' driving up the value of money. |
There is only oae way to restore confidence j
a ml that ie to give confidence a babis to rest on.
Mr. Bryan returned with Mr. Sewalland j
the other members of the party to th* '
Boston and Maine Railroad station, fol
lowed by a big crowd, whici cheered him !
repeatedly. The party took the 8:20 ex- j

PROVIDENCE. R. L, Sept. 28.â Mr. i
Bryan's trip from Boston to Providence I
was without special incident. No stops '
were made en rouie, and Providence was '
reacned at 10:01. Fifteen thousand neople
greeted Mr. Bryan in this city. A plat
form had been erected near the soldie.s'
and sailors' monument on Exchange
place, and here ex-Governor Davis intro
duced the Democratic candidate. After
warning the crowd against pickpockets
Mr. Bryan said:
When I define an honest dollar as an honest
dollar which does not change in its purchas
ing power, it may give to you a definition
which has been a sound definition among all
writers on political economy. When I give
you turn definition I am simply giving you a
definition which has been given' to the world
by that distinguished educator who lives in
this city and who is an honor, not only to the
city and to this State, but to the Nation. [Ap
plause.] President Andrews in a recent work
entitled "An Honest Dollar," commences the
first chapter with the words which I shall
quote: "It is always assumed or admitted ttiat
the ideal sort of money would be money , with
a unit, having a steadiast general purchasing
power." When President Andrews describes
the ideal money as a money whose unit is the
steadfast or general average of purchasing
power, he planted himself upon the solid rock
and all the financiers of this or other coun
tries cannot prevail against the character of
this definition. [Applause.]
The poet has told us that "An honest man
is the noblest work of God." We may supple
ment this statement by adding that an houest
dollar, wherever it is found or made, will be
the noblest work of man. But, my friends, the
gold dollar which is praised to-day at the
honest dollar, is not me honest dollar, and
those who love It most, love it because of its
own dishonesty as a dollar. [Applause.] An
honest Hollar is one which preserves its gen
eral purchasing power from day to day and
from year to year. Then the dollar which rises
in purchasing power is just as dishonest as
the dollar which fails in purchasing power. If
one of our Western men advocntes bimetal
lism and calls attention to the injustice of the
gold standard, they any that he lacks educa
tion, ana when a learned man like Professor
Andrews advocates bimetallism mid denounces
the gold standard wnu empnasis which can
not be surpassed, what do they say of him? â
"Much learning hath made him mad."
We sav*that anybody who has a piece of
gold sufficient to make one dollar can have
that dollar coined into a dollar. And the fact
that any holder of gold bullion can at any
time convert that bullion into money enables
him to charge for that gold bullion the mint
price. The mint price for silver would be es
tablished the fame at the mint price for gold
baa been established. Under free coinage at
10 to 1 a man who owns silver bullion knows
that he can take it to the mint and have it
converted into dollars of 100 cents of United
States money. Some of our opponents have
been calculating as to how much money they
could make under free , coinage -in buying
silver for. 50 cents and having it coined into
100 cents. If any of you held silver bullion
would you sell it to anybody for half the mar
ket price and let- the purchaser make the
profit? . â  ; â¢ . . â¢
NEW LONDON, Cora., Sept 28.â Mr.
Bryan reached New London from Provi
denca at 12:17 T. M. A stand had been
erected at the soldiers' and sailors' monu
ment adjacent to the railway station and
from this Mr. Bryan made an address an
hour Ions; to an audience of 3000 people.
He was cheered frequently and asked sev
eral questions by people in the crowd.
After reference to tne fact that this was
the county in which Lyman Trura bull was
born, Mr. Bryan paid a warm tribute to
the late Senator's memory. Continuing,
he said: .
To-day I leave Connecticut. I have been
through the several New England States, and
only one I have not been able to visit. 1 1 came
to New England to preach the cause and to de
fend the principles for which I stand this
time. [Applause.] I came because there is no
part of ihe country where those who advocate
free coinage are unwilling to present their
cause. There is no part of this country which
is excluded from the benefits of bimetallism;
there Is no part of this country which we are
willing to concede to the gold ; standard. [Ap
plause and cheers]. . . ,
Some of the Republican platforms of the'
Eastern States have not only declared against
silver, but have declared against agitation.
When I find a man who is opposed to a discus
sion of a public question 1 find a man who
would feel more at home under a monarch
than he would under a republic. [Applause.]
Agitation is nothing but discussion [applause
and cries of "That's sol. Â»nd discussion is the
only means by which the people can find out
what is best, and remedy the wrong. [Ap

system, because we borrowed it from another
country [applause], not only borrowed it, but,
my friends, we are anxious to return it to the
land from which we borrowed iv [Great ap
plause.]
It you doubt it let me call your attention to
this fact, that until thi* campaigu no political
party in the United States ever declared the
cold standard a good thing. Toe Republican
party declares that bimetallism is desirable,
but until the leading nations of Europe also
desire bimetallism, we must go without it. I
am unwilling to admit that foreign nations
shall determine what kind of iintincial sys
tem we shall have in thi* country. [Applause.]
We advocate an independent financial policy;
we advocate the adoption oi a system by the
American people ;or the American people and,
my friends, one of the evidences that we are
right is that our opponents are noi willing to
openly declare that which they are secretly
seeking to secure. [Anplau>t\] Ho Republi
can is willing to write up-m a turd mid wear
upon his breast that m lule he is an American
citizen he does not think this Nation is big
enough to attend to its own business [ap

form means.
A voiceâ Where will we be when we g6t
free silver?
Mr. Brvanâ Are you in favor of a gold
standard?
The voice â I am.
"Tell me why."
The voice â Because I believe it is the
best for the 'country. Every nation will
accept a gold dollar for a dollar.
Mr. Bryanâ Why? I will tell you. Be
cause of its value. The reason why our
gold dollar and gold bullion are worth the
same is because the law says you can con
vert bullion into a dollar at tti mint.
The voice â Well, how about silver?
Mr. Bryan â When the laws are so under
the free coinage of silver that the holder
of silver bullion can convert his silver
bullion into dollars at the mint that will {
fix a mint price for silver then, as we have
a mint price for gold now, and silver dol
lars will be worth as much abroad as our
gold dollars. [Great applause and cheer
ing. J Now, my friends, Ido not object to
have questions asked, because if I am
wrong on this question there is nobody
more anxious to find it out than 1 am.
But if l am right and my friend is wrong
I hope he will be anxious to get right as
lam. [Great applause.] Questions do not
bun, my friends. We are glad to answer
questions, because there is not a question
tuat can be answered by an advocate of
the god standard that cannot be answered
by aiivocaies of free coinage. [Applause
and cries of "Why don't MeKinley come
out and answer -ome of them?"]
A voice â People here have the impres
sion that when the free coinage of silver
is brought into effect they can take their
silver pots and coin them into money.
Mr. Bryan â The gentleman say 9 the
people have tiie impression that under
free coinage the people can take silver tea
pots and silverware and have it coined
into money. It is true that under free
coinage any man can melt up a dol
lar and a bail's Worth of spoons and
have the silver coined into one dollar and
twenty-nine cents, if you have a man who
is fool enough to do it. [Great applause.]
Now, why will people refuse to melt up
their silverware? Because it will be worth
more as silverware than it will be worth
in silver dollars under free coinage [ap
plause], and, my friends, you can depend
upon it that people will not do
things which are eoing to hurt if
they' know it. That Is one the
things that you base your reasoning
upon and in that connection I frequently
huve people ask me, "Wouldn't it oe pos
sible for a man to buy silver lor n.ty-three
cents'and have it coined into a dollar and
mane the difference?" - | Laughter and a
voice, "Who is going to sell it?"] Toe
gentleman asks the question, which shows
he understands it. He Bays who would
sell it. Now, when you cannot coin silver
you can buy for fifty-three. cents the silver
that is in a dollar, but when you can have
that silver coined . for a dollar then you
cannot find anybody who. will sell you
that silver for fifty-three cents. Now, my
friends, if the farmer cannot get money
for what he produces how is He going to
have the money to buy what other people
have to sell? [A voice, "Start lip the
mills."] Continuing Mr. Bryan said:
Suppose you start up the mills; how are you
going to dispose of the things which the mill
produce nule*s people can buy the produce of
your mills? While the Republicans are accus
ing us of arraying class ugainitt class they are
doing more Lv this campaign to appeal to class
distinctions and class interests than was ever
done by any party In the history of the United
Spates. [Applause] Out In my State the Re
publican committee tried to array the bchool
leachers against trie people who pity the taxes.
You will see every day Utters sent out trying
to array the- wage-earner against the farmer.
They tell the man who is drawing a salary
that the free coinage of silver will hurt him
and that bednust look out for nis salary. They
have not appealed to the people in this coun
try and asked tnem to consider the interests of
the country. * : , â¢ ...
Look at the applications which are furnished
to r.ulroad men. [App.ause.J They are ear
nestly requested to observe their own inter
es.s by lining a club, and in the application
you will find a statement like this: am
opposed to free coinage because it would in
jure me as a wage-earner." They want those
who join sound-money clubs to assert that
they have an individual personal reason for
antagonizing free silver, and yet the great
advocates of the gold standard-, want you to
believe that they have no personal interest for
favoring a gold standard. [Applause.] Do
the members of the syndicates wi.ich have
been bleeding 'the country assert that they
have a pecuniary interest in deeding tne
Government, and therefore they don't want
that right taken away from them?
Do the heads of the. railroads say that they
have any interest in this campaign in trying
to prevent arbitration? No. Do they assert
that they/ are in this campaign for blood, be
cause they want to continue government by
injunction? Not at all. [Applause] They
want you to believe that they are patriotic
people who lie awake at night wondering how
they can do something for toiling humanity.
[Laughter and applause.] They are not only
trying to array me wage-earner againbtthe
' farmer, but they make a special appeal to 'the
depositors in the savings banks, and tell you
they don't want free coinage of silver because
it will enable them to pay their depositors in
cheap dollars, and tiey ere afraid that if they
are enabled to do so that they won't have the
moral courage to do so, but will pay you in
go d dollars. - â¢ :.â  . â 
I know a little about the banking business.
I will know more as soon as I get my tax divi
dend on the amount I had deposited when the
bank tailed. [Laughter.] We had a cashier of
that bank who was afraid of silver and wanted
honest money, and was afraid that the people
would get 50-cent dollars. They would have
been glad to get paid in 50-cent dollars. [Great
cheering and laughter.] â¢ Mr. Blnine in 1878
said that the dest uctlon of silver as money
and the establishmentÂ©!" the gold dollar as the
sole unit of value must have a ruinous effect on
all forms of property except those investments
which yield a fixed return in money, and
these would be enormously enhanced in value
and gain a disproportionate and unfair ad
vantage over every oiner species of property.
[Cheers.]
"Would it not be as hard to change the
standard of money in the world as it
would to change the standard of weights
and measures in the world? asked a
voice. . ; - " . - . : â¢ . .
I will answer your question by saying that
In the first place the world has no standard of
weights and measures, and we have been un
able to bring the nations of the world to agree
to a standard of weights and measures. [Great
applause. j In the second place why did you
not give that advice in 1873 you are giving
now? Tney changed our standard of money
then and for, twenty years they have tried to
keep us from: undoing what they did then.
[Cheers.] Those who denied the right of the
people to use the law to restore silver to its
rightful place are the very ones who helped to
pass a law twenty-three years- ago to destroy
the free coinage of silver and substitute a new
standard after the ! nations of the â  world had
tried bimetallism and after this Nation had

PORIEN IN TRACHER'S PLACE.
Uletated to the Bead of the Ticket by the
Silrer Democrat*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 28 âThe regu
lar Democratic ticket of the State of New
York, revised by the State Committee
this evening, is:
For Governor â Wilbur F. Porter of
Watertown.
For Lieutenant-Governor â Fred C.
Schraub of Lowville.
For Associate Justice Court Of Appealsâ .
Robert C. Titus of Buffalo.
It was supposed to be settled that Elliott
Danforth, chairman of the State Commit
tee, would be placed at the head of the
ticket to fill the vacancy caused by the
declination of John Boyd Thacher. At
the eleventh hour Mr. Danforth, who had
been in telephonic communication with
Senator Hill, dec ded that he would not
permit his name to be used. He told tne
committee so, and the managers of the
Democratic campaign got together and
decided to push Judge Porter up from
second place to first and to nominate Fred
C. Shraub Lieutenant-Governor. No change
was made in third place on the ticket.
The committee was called to order by
Chairman. Danforth at 9:15 p. m. After
rollcall Bernard F. Yoke reported for the
committee appointed to notify candidates
that Mr. Thac .er had declined, but bad
stated that he intended to support the
Chicago ticket and tue State ticket of the
party.
Chairman Danforth called Thomas F.
Graly to the chair and presented the name
of Wilbur F. Porter as a candidate for
Governor. There were no more nomina
tions.
Beiore the vote was taken Mr. Purroy
inquired where Mr. Porter stood in regard
to ihe platform. Mr. Danforth stated that
Mr. Porter would stand squarely upon the
platform of the committee and fully in
dorses the Chicago platform. The vote
was unanimous.
Charles N. Bulger of Oswego presented
the name of Frederick C. Schraiab lor
Lieutenant-Governor. He Â«tatea that
Mr. Sctiraub was one of tbe delegates to
the Chicago convention and was one of
the first to declare himself for the Chi
cago ticket and platform. Mr. Schraub
was nominated unanimously.
A committee was appointed and Candi
date Schraub was brought into the room.
Mr. Schraub made a short speech, in
which he expressed his gratification at
having received the honor of a unanimous
nomination. All the members of the
committee were present or represented by
proxies.
Frederick C. Schraub, the nominee for
Lieutenant-Governor, is a native of this
Slate, of German parentage. He was
three terms District Attorney ot Lewis
County. When .the Dairy Commission
was done away with and a Commisiioner
of Agriculture created, Mr. Schraub was
appointed by Governor Morion as one
of the Directors of the State Agricul
tural Staiiou at Geneva. He now holds
that place.
FOR BRYAN AND WATSON.
Action Taken by Xebratka Miadle-of-th:
Jtoad l'ojiuliata.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Sept, 28.â The out
come of the middlr-of-the-road Populist
convention to-day does not change in any
way the status oi the party in Nebraska.
The convention was much of a farce at
best, with no regularly elected delegates,
and not more than a dozen men outside
this county in attendance. Populists
favorable to Bryan and fusion with Demo
rats captured the convention and despite
the passionate protest of C. McKay, the
prime mover in the meeting, put tha con
vention on record as favoiing the plan
outlined by the regular State convention
in tbe following resolution, which was
adopted :
Rttolvcd, That we. the representatives of the
mjdale-oi-the-road Populists of Nebraska in
convention assembled, hereby indorse W. J.
Bryan and T. B. WHtson as candidates for
President and Vice-President of the United
States; also the Presidential electors and all
nominees of the Populist party in the State,
and pledge them our hearty support, and it is
the sense of this convention that any one
failing to support such nominees Is not a true
Popuilsu
This leaves the whole matter just where
it was, with four Bryan and Watson and
four Bryan and Sewall elector?. Mr.
Clara's protest is due to the charge that
there ia a secret understanding between
the Democrats and half-hearted Populists
t.'iat ciewall is to have the entire eight
votes. No effort was made to nominate a
State ticket.
CIGARMAKERS IN SESSION
Progress Made During the Year
by the International
Union.
Billions of Smokes Turned Out and
Millions E trnei by the M n
Emp'oyed.
DETROIT, Mich., Sept. 28.â Nearly 300
delegates were present in Turner Hall this
morning when President G. W. Perkins
called the twenty-first session of the
Cgarmakers' International Union of
America to order. Thomas Dolan, repre
senting the local unions, made an address
of welcome, which was responded to by
President Perkins. A committee on cre
dentials was appointed, and the commit
tee adjourned until the afternoon.
At the afternoon session President Per
kins read his report, â¢ hich was an ex
haustive one. The report shows that the
cigar trade has not materially improved,
although, there has been a slight increase
in the output. The total product for con
sumption in the United States alone for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, was
4,237,755,943 cigars. The total number of
factories of all kinds is 14,070, ol which
number 7147 are strictly union and 6923
are mixed and non-union. The union
factories give employment to 12,278 union
hand workmen and 15,247 union mold
workmen. The open shops employ 10,675
union and non-union persons. The total
amount of wages paid out per year is $41,
-767.989, and the value ol the product is
$129,693,275. v
During the past three years the receipts
of the international office were $87,111 and
the expenses $85,572, leaving a balance of
$1539 in the treasury. Since the last re
port the International Union has had 458
difficulties to adjust, which involved 7174
members and 5412 non-unionists. One
hundred and seventy-nine of these were
adjusted successfully, 18 compromised. 20
declared off, 87 disapproved and 44 are
still in progress. Of the remainder 51
were lost outright, in 18 the cause removed
and 40 were ended by members obtaining
employment elsewhere. The strike ex
pense during tnis period was $113,461.
President Perkins favors a federation of
labor unions which shall recognize The
autonomy of each component part and
also an eight-hour day with a Saturday
holiday, or a six-hour day without the
holiday.

AN APPEAL TO
CATHOLIC CLERGY
Tammany Gives Out What
It Thinks Will Be a
Boomerang.
AID IN THE CAMPAIGN
Alleged to Be Asked by McKin
ley Managers of the Church
Leaders.
ANAKCHY MTTST NOT CONTKOI.
Archbishop Hughes' Example in a
Former Crisis of the Nation
Is Alluded To.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 28.â The fol
lowing letter addressed to the Catholic
clergy of the United States by, it is said,
the MeKinley and Hobart Business Men's
National Campaign Committee, was given
out to-day at Tammany Hall:
TENTH STREET, ABOVE CHESTNUT.
Philadelphia, Sept. 19, 1896.
Reverend and Year Sir: We are all aware that
the dignity of your sacred office forbids the ex
ercise of your influence in any political mat
ter involving mere questions of executive or
legislative policy.
Nevertheless, we are fully persuaded that
the questions before ike country in the pend
ing Presidential campaign are of an especially
serious character, because they involve funda
mental moral Issues. A decsion In the selec
tion of President that will commit the execu
tive to a policy that in its application will
forcibly compromise private financial obliga
tions and will repudiate a portion of the
National debts will be a violation of the basic
Christian principle that commands honesty
between man and man. Such a decision, we
believe, would be thoroughly immoral, and
would precipitate an ethical and material
calamity oi incalculable magnitude.
We are aiso of the opiniou that the attack
now being made upen the regularly consti
tuted legal authorities of the National Gov
ernment is pernicious and dangerous to an
extreme degree, for it contains rebellioa
against, those safeguards of law upon which
society, the individual, the several States of
the Nation must depend for security and pro
tection. If successful the vital principles of
our Government will be undermined.
Recalling with gratitude the patriotism and
eminent public services of the late Most
Reverend Archbishop Hughes and many
others of the Roman Catholic clergy when the
integrity of the Government was threatened
on a former occasion, w% take the liberty to
suggest that the present is a period of equal
danger. 'Ihe Government is not threatened
by physical force, but insidious and false ideas
that inspire incipient anarchy and contempt
for proper authority are industriously propa
gated throughout our country.
It is not our purpose to argue the foregoing
suggestions. We merely desire to respectfully
express tna opinion that present Do.uical
issues involve vital moral question* that pow
erfully appeal to tne religious instructors ol
the people. Our committee is not partisan.
It includes neither office-holders nor office
seekers. We have no personal political inter.
esU to serve, being private citizens associated
ior patriotic purposes. Very respectfully,
Robert C. Ogdkn,
Chairman Republican Committee.
The Tammany chieftains are very much
incensed at this appeal to tbe Catholic
clergy to support McKiniey and Hobart,
which, they think, will prove a boom
erang.
General Osborne, when shown a copy of
the letter at Republican headquarters, said
he knew nothing about it.
Arthur Sewall, the Democrattc candi
date for Vice-President, arrived at the
Fifth-avenue Hotel this afternoon. Mr.
Sewall said Mr. Bryan got a magnificent
reception in Maine, and gave it as bis
belief that the candidate of the Demo
cratic party in that State would be im
proving every day up to the election time.
The Vice-Presidential candidate expects
to remain in this city until Wednesday
next.
At the headquarters of the gold Demo
cratic party word was received from Chi
cago this morning that the farmers of the
Northwest are becoming distrustful of tha
free-silver theories and requesting the im
mediate shipment of 25,000 copies of Sec
retary Carlisle's speech.
PRISO N REFORM WORK.
Some Interesting Topic* Before the Xa
tional Convention.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Sept. 28â The
most important meeting of the National
Prisons convention took place here this
morning, when that branch known as the
Wardens' Association met to listen to
papers and for mutual exchange of views.
In the absence of Captain Joseph Nichol
son, superintendent of t tie House of Cor
rection at Detroit, who is president of the
association, Captain Wright of Allegheny,
Pa., presided, and Secretary McLoughery
of Pontiac, 111., read President Nicholson's
annual address. This address contained a
brief history of the association of wardens,
which was formed ten years ago, and a
number of valuable suggestions, devoting
considerable space to child labor.
An interesting paper on convict labor
and the conduct of wardens was read by
Colonel Charles* E. Felton of Chicatro,
member of the Board of Managers of the
State Industrial Reformatory of Illinois.
He was followed by Warden J. W. French
of the United States Penitentiary at Fort
Leavenworth, Kans., on "The Relation of
the Federal Penitentiary to the Various
State Institutions." This was followed by
a general discussion on various subjects,
the most interesting being whether pris
oners should be allowed to use tobacco.
The affirmative side seemed to have the
best of the argument.
The afternoon session was devoted to
the Chaplains' Association meeting. Rev.
G. H. liickok, chaplain of the Michigan
State Prison, president of the association,
read his annual report and was followed
by Chaplain Thorn of Huntsville, Tex.,
who delivered an address on "The Spirit
ana Action of the Pri on Chaplain."
Trinity* Chime* Recorded,
NEW YORK, N. V., Bept. 28. â The
famous chimes of old Trinity were re
corded on a phonograph just before ser
vices yesterday. It has been talked of for
a long time, but it was not until last week
that Rev. Morgan Dixgave his permission,
he having objected to the work be
ing done on Sunday. A large phono
graph was constructed specially for the
purpose and was set up- in a gallery just
above the bells. All the melodies played
by Organist Meiselahn were taken and the
men in charge said that the experiment
was completely successful.
Chat^/ea Against Railroads.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Sept. 28.â The Inter
state Commerce Commission is hearing
complaints made by the Business Men's
league of this city against the Iron Moun
tain, Missouri Paciiio, Cotton Belt, Kansas
and Texas and Frisco railways, composing
the Southwestern Traffic Association. It
is charged that the railroads are violating;
the interstate commerce act. in that their
charges for the transportation of freight
in less than carload quantities from St.
Louis and otner. points in the State to
Texas is unreasonable and unjust. Chair
man Morrison and Commissioners J. C.
Clements and J. D. Yeamans represent the
Interstate Commerce Commission. The
hearing will probably last several days.

Times, and Then Goes Gunning for
His Own Wife.

afternoon Dr. L. Johnston, one oi tiie best
known physicians in the county, called
into his office Druggist George S. Henry, a

dangerous, but it is thought that Henry
cannot live.

NO IMPORT TEXAS BUTTON.
A Representative of. Japan on an Im
portant Mission. 'â¢' ,
WACO, Tex., Sept. 28â Mr. * fsurutani
of Kobe, Japan, is here with letters of in
troduction to local cotton shippers. The
object of his visit is to arrange on the part
of the Japanese manufacturers of cotton
textiles for direct importation of Texas ,
cotton into . Japanese ports. Tsurmani
says there are eighty plants in Japan" for
the manufacture- of cotton goods, and
other mills are about to be established.
I His nation intends to supply cotton goods
largely in the East and will send buyers
annually to the cotton States, as is the
practice with the European spinners.
Mr. Tsurutani says Texas cotton will
shortly be shipped from San Francisco to
Tokio on a Japanese steamship, which
will be a new movement in the cotton
trade.
Cotton Damaged by Rain
. AUSTIN, Tex.. Sept. 2S.â Reports from
all sections of the State received here yes
terday indicate that the cotton crop has
been seriously damaged by the heavy
rains of Friday night and Saturday. Cot
ton was full blown and hundreds of acres
were washed clean. Cotton deaWs think
that the damage will seriously affect their
figures on the result of the crop and
may reduce the estimates many hundred
bales.

STANFORD SENIORS WIN.
The Sophomore Football Eleven
Beaten in an Interclass
Match.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Sept
28. â The second interclass game came off
to-day amid great excitement. The seniors
and sophomores were matched, and each
â¢class turned out its "rooters" in goodly
numbers. Since '98 was beaten so handily
by the freshmen, and was thus put out of
the race for the interclass champions!. ip,
great eagerness was evinced as to what the
.other under-ciass would do to its rivals.
That the freshmen should turn down the
juniors was a matter for great surprise,
arid many a student wondered whether
upper classmen were to have their pride
a. am lowered by a defeat at the hands of
the mores.
The '99s were admitted to haye several
good players, especially their punter,
Freeman, Quarterback MclTtosh ana Cen
ter It. W lbur, while it- was equally well
known that on the whole the seniors had
a superior aggregation, but sadly needed a
good punter. Co-eds turned out en masse
and occupied a portion of the grand stand,
from whence they watched the struggle
for supremacy. Several members oi the
faculty were interested observers of the
pa me. -
Play was spirited in thÂ« first half, but
neither side scored. ' Just before time was
called at the end of the second the seniors
made a â¢ touchdown and kicked a goal. j
The play in this half was as follows:
â¢ '97's Young made a good try, but Wil
bur stopped the k.ck and the ball bounded
I oaclc of the center l.ne five-yards. Lawton
: made a short train, and B. Thomas made a six- I
'yaril-e'nd run/ but the ball was lost on a
fumble. . - : .
'99'8*ballâ A buck reunited in no gain. The
playing, was very - rocky at this stage as at
many others.
'978 ballâ B. Thomas kicked for twenty-five

and made one yard. Brunton tried a run, but

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1896.
LIEUTENANT LANG
WANTS TO RETIRE
Bad Health and Not Social
Ostracism Is the
Cause.
DENIES ALL THE RUMORS
But Scandal's T> n-ue Yet Wags
Over H s Marriage to a
Soldier's Daughter.
AH ALLEGED HUMILIATION.
Sergeant Kenkler, the Officer's F ther.
in-Law, Ordered ior Duty at
the S m Post
WASHINGTON. D. C, Sept. 28.â A great
deal has been published in the papers of
late concerning the alleeed ostracism of
Lieutenant Lang, Second Artillery, be
au-o of his marriage to the daughter
of Quartermaster-Sergeant Kinkier. The
latest report is that his father-in-law has
been ordered to duty at the same post aa
the officer, with the view of humiliating
aim. There is said to be an unwritten
social rule m the army, which forbids
social intercourse between the families of
officers and the families of enlisted men,
which alleged rule, it is said, would pre
vent Mrs. Lang from visiting or receiving
visits fr- m her own lather or mother, not
withstanding they were all at the same
post.
An emphatic denial of the-=e reports is
i mad- oy the officials of the War Depart
ment, where the reports of alleged ostra
cism are regarded as wholly imaginary.
Lieutenant Lang is also on record as hav
ing expressed regret that the impression
prevailed anywhere that he had been the
victim of social ostracism. He has a high
strung nervous temperament and has suf
| fered for years witu a nervous disorder, on
| account of which he has endeavored to be
placed on the re'ired list. He is now at
Gi nham, near Fishkill, on a six months'
j leave of absence on account of sickness.
' In an interview on the subject, Lieutenant
j Lan said :
"Lhavs never told any one that I had
â¢ fceÂ»-n slighted on account of my rnarn.ige.
j Even if I lelt that there wan a disposition
j to ostracize me it wonid be unbecoming
; in me as an officer to say such a thing.
If I felt myself aggrieved there are several
ways in which as an officer of the army I
cou d state my grievance.
"The report that I want to be retired
â  from the army on account of social ostra
i cism is witliout foundation. My sole
â  reason for desiring to be retired is on
account of ill health. I have done much
hard work and I am not in condition
j physically to attend to the exacting duties
|of an army officer. If I am sufficiently
improved in health after the expiration of
the six months' leave of absence wh.ch I
have obtained I shall gladly go back to
I the service.
"The constant allusion to my case has
done me much harm. I have seen things
attributed to me in certain newspapers
| which I have never uttered. There is no
I reason why my maniage should have
been so widely discus?e â¢;. It is not so re
markable a thing for an officer to marry
tbo daughter of a soldier. I could men
tion half a dozen case!) within my personal
knowledge. EvÂ°n if social ostracism Lad
followed my marriage I would be the last
I man to complain of it I would willingly
| accept it as a matter of course. I have
I never before talKed for publication on
this matter."
In Fishkill, where the lientenant is well
known, the impression is tha 1 the stories
of the lieutenant's social ostracif-m have
little foundation. Mrs. Lang is spoken of
in the highest terms. A man who had
been at West Jfoint with the lieutenant at
the time of his marriage to Miss KenKler
said that the Bocial ostracism existed
mainly in the mind of the lieutenant him
self. He said that some persona did speak
slightingly to the lieutenant, but that any
' feeling they may have bad against him
began long before his marriage.
THREE MEM ACCIDENTALLY SHOT.
Militia Members in Greater Danger of One
Another Than of the
Strikers.
LEADVILLE, Col., SÂ»pt. 28.â Things
are very quiet here to-day an.i promise
to remain so. President Boies for the
; strikers told General Brooks to-day that
the miners tiad no concessions to make
I and could not make any. 8o a things re
main in statu quo.
The conference committee has not as
yet announced its decision. Th 6 report
j was current this morning that the com
mittee bad decided to continue the strike,
but this remaine unconfirmed.
The belief is growing that the commit
tee will finally decide to call the strike off,
but the mine operators have not received
any in-timation of the intention.
In the past ten hours three men hare
I been accidentally shot at the Emmet
! mine. One of the militia officers
eariy this evenine accidentally dis
charged a shotgun, shooting Captain Kava
naugh's horse from under him, wounding
two miners, one of them being shot
in the wrist, but slightly injured,
the other one, Frank Rainey, shot
in the side, seriously injuied. To
night Sergeant Hamilton, Compay
G, Cripple Creek, who was out with a
ncouting party, was ordered to halt by
Sentinei Palmer. Hamilton was a little
slow in responding, when Palmer fired,
the bullet seriously wounding him in the
left knee.
The executive committee of the Miners'
Dnion, it is understood, will report
Wednesday night whether or not they
favor calline off .he strike.
Edward tfoyce of Idaho, president of
the Federation of Miners, made an ad
dress to a body of Scandnavian miners
this evening. He .-poke bitterly of the
military company formed here last wei-k
by the citizens.
He advised the men to hold out, stating
that the federation wouM see that their
families did not suffer. Hft declared that
the trouble which has ocurred nereis not
due to the Miners' Union people, but
from men shipped in hers by mine man
agers. The m eting was a private one,
with the exception of the attendance of a
few of General Brooks' staff.

TO ORDAIN THE OFFICERS.
Ballington Booth to Give the Chief Leaders
of the Volunteers the Right to Ad
minister the Sacrament.
NEW xORK. N. V., Sept. 28.â Since
the recent ceremony by which Com
mander Ballington Booth of the Volun
teers of America became an ordained min
ister of the church many -of his friends
have aske.l the question as to whether in
his capacity as minister of the gospel he
will administer the ri.e of holy communion
and the other sacraments to the members
of his or animation. Commander Booth
will in future exercise his authority to ad
minister the Lord's sapper to the mem
bers of his organization, and the same
rite will be performed by his subordi
nates in future ordained. He says be does
not intend to form a new sect or denomi
nation.
"I found from my experience with the
Balvation Army," said Commander
Booth, "that a great element of weakness
in that organization was owing to the fact
that it is outside ot t c church instead of
being within the church and auxiliary to
it I h' d it essential that the sacraments
should be introduced into our service, and
in order to have that accomplished it be
comes necessary that I shou.d be regularly
ordained as a minister. In furtherance of
â¢ his idea, it will become necessary to or
dain the leading officers of the Volunteers
so that they have tije right to administer
the sacrament to those under their care,
but under no circums-.ances shall I ordain
laymen, but only tnose.who stand as cler
gymen do to their respective churches.'
As soon as Bripad:er-Gcneral Fielding
of Chicago, Colonel Hattie Lindscy
of this city, Lieutenant-Colonel Wol
ley of Buffalo, Major Biackhurst
of San Francisco and other staff ofti
oers shall have been duly ordained, th^
rite of holy communion will be adminis
tered In all the pots of Volunteers on the
first day of each month.

DARING JAIL DELIVERY.
S x Desperate Convicts Bruta ly
Assauit the Warden and-
Escape.
\
Two of the Fug.tives Are C plured,
but the Oth rs Gain Their
Lib-r y.
Wilmington, del., Sept. 28.â The
boldest jail delivery that ever occurred in
this section was committed at the county
jail at Newcastle Saturday night. Six
desperate convicts brutally assaulted
Warden Reed, and relieving him of his
keys and revolver, made their escape from
prison. They were Bonnie Harris, Wil
liam Duncan, alias "Lurry the Yorker,"
Thomas Gibbons, alias "Cleveland Jim
my,' 1 "Brooklyn Whalen" and another
wnose name has not been ascertained.
It is customary with the management
of the Newcastle jail to allow the pris
oners to stroll up and down the corridors
for an hour every evening. Last evening
Warden Reed went into one of the bacfc
cells to play cards with some of the
friendly prisoners. Harris and his com
rades wore parading the corridor at the
time, and they quickly planned their es
cape.
While Warden Reed was seated at a
table in the cell, dealing the cards, Harris
and Gibbons walked in and exchanged
greetings with him. The latter, not sus
pecting trouble, went on with the game.
Harris gave Gibbons the cue, and the lat
ter struck Reed a terrific blow, knocking
him senseless to the floor.
They rifled his pockets and took the keys
of the corridor d'ior and two revolvers.
Duncan and Harris took charge of the pis
tols. Gibbon* led the party, and after
getting out of the corridor safely they
made their way to the jail yard and scaled
the wall by means of ropes. They were
not gone five minutes before a prisoner in
the jail gave the alarm. Then the whole
town learned it and started in pursuit of
the fugitives.
Duncan and Harris were recaptured, but
the others are still at liberty.

SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 28.âRepubli
cans gathered in numbers on the plaza
here to-night. Every available seat was
occupied, and hundreds stood up. The
crowd numbr-red at least 3000 people. The
McKinley Club, several hundred strong,
marched from headquarters to the plaza
wiih inspiring music, and the Coronado
McKinley Club in uniforms crossed the
bay and marched up the street to the tune
of martial strains.
The chairman of the evening was Philip
Morse, president of the Chamber of Com
merce. There was a lar^e list of vice
presidents. T o speaker was Major C.
W. Ky!e of San Francisco. He was loudly
appiuud d for his witty opening remarks.
He soon revealed that he was an orator oj
no mean merit, i resenting the doctrine
o! protection and sound money in sue
convincing fashion that men in the audi
dence cotnd be seen nodding haads and
whispering "That's so." Frequent ap
plause was given to the many points
made by the speaker. Major Kyle de
voted himself to the issues of protection
and sound money. In referring to the
present attitude of the Democracy as tue
champions of free trade he said :
"Why. Thomas Jefferson, the father of
the Democratic party, was as ardent a
protectionist as the lather of his countty;
and Andrew JackÂ«on, the irtol of the D<
mucracy, was a s out believer in protec
ticn to American labor and American in
dustry. The pictures of these great Dem
ocrats are kept out of sight in thp present
campaiun and th.ise of thr BoyOiator and
renegade ?ilver Republicans are flaunted
as the leaders of the American people!
But the Ame lean peopie are their own
leaders and will lead tbem.-eves i jck to
protection, s< und money and prosperity."
The campaign is now fully on in this
country and the indications point to Re
publican success wuh the oid-time ma- I
jontv. The free-.-iiver craze is admitted ;
to be weaiiÂ»r than during the early par: of
the campaign. Democrats are noticeably
less confident of carrying the State for I
Bryan, while Republicans are encouraged I
by the outlook and fully expect to th.row
California into the MrK.n.ey column.
Public meetings are being held by the
Republicans in every precinct.
TALKS TO ME DOCINO VOTERS.
fdAmlMlli Reception to ttrprenentative
Barhun at Vkiah.
UK! AH, Cal., Sept. L'B.â Republicans
from all parts of Mendociuo County, and
especially from tho valleys of the interior,
attended the rally held here Saturday
evening. Crowds thronged the main
streets of the town, and the enthusiasm
fur the Republican candidates and the
principles oi the party was never before
equated at this place. Before the meeting
opened patriotic airs were rendere 1 by the
Ukiah Si.ver Cornet band. When the hall
was reached numbers of people were in
waitiug to greet the speakers of the even
ing. Seats had been provided for 800, and
when these were filled many were left
standing. The hall *as tastily decorated.
Large posters, contrasting the condition
of the workinginan und r the Democratic
and Republican administrations, were
conspicuous. On the stage waÂ« a magnifi
cent life-size pictuie of Major McKinley.
Hon. T. L. Carotaers, who was one of
Preside ;t Harrison's electors, from this
Slate in 1888, called the meeting to order,
and stated in a clear and cone se manner
the issues before the people. He was in
terrupted by cheers, and when the chair
man presented to the audi nee the first
speaker of the evening, Hon. John A.
Barnaul, at present the Congressman from
the First District and a candidate for re
ele. lion, the audience almost went wild.
Hats were thrown in the air and the en
thusiasm was intense. Mr. Barham was
obliged to wait several minutes to allow
tne applause to subside be. ore he could
begin speaking.
Mr. Barham was attentively listened to,
and iiis pointed arguments and clear ex
position of the issues of the day were well
received. He spoke for about an hour,
and during that time made many tolling
points against the free silver and free
trade ideas of the "Bryanite-." He re
fused, he said, to call them Democrats.
He compared Mr. Bryan to the physician !
wlio was _ood at curing "tits." Mr. Bryan
admitted that a panic would follow his
election.
"Has it come to this, my fellow-citizens,
that we must have a panic â are the Amer
can people in that condition that it re
auires a panic to bring us back to pros
perity?" asked Mr. Barham. A voice
from the audience cried out, "Not much."
Mr. Barham discussed the money and
tariff question thoroughly, and then re
ferred to the Nicaragua canal, for which
he bad himself presented a bill in the
House at iis last session. The completion
of this work, he stated, would increase the
value of the stumpage in this county alone
to the extent of $75,000,000. As regards
the lunding bill, he stated that there was
no reason apparent to him why the rail
roads should not pay their debt to the
Government.
Alter Mr. Barham had concluded his
speech, Hon. J. H. Roberts was introduced
by the chairman and spoke briefly of the
money and tariff planks in the Republican
platiorra. His remark* were interspersed
by frequent sallies of wit directed against
the Potiopathic remedy for the cure of all
of our ills at tlm time. He saw, he said,
a great resemblance between the Popo
cratic party and a mule, tn that the latter,
like the party of Bryan, had neith-r
"pride of ancestry nor hope of posterity."
Tuis remark was greeted with much laugh
ter by tn<> audience.
Mr. Robens compared the results of the
country under the last two administra
tions. In referring to the silver question,
he stated that the true bankers ot tui* Na
tion were the poor people â the hod-carrier,
the washerwoman and other- of the same
station ir. life; that 128,000 people in San
Francisco had standing in their names in
the banks of San Francibco $105. 000,000.

whole human race.
'"Whenever franchisement has been

Storjr; ;of ;\ -the Killing Told to
Detective Cody by an
. ;â¢ ';./ . . â¢ Eye-Witness.
SAW THE VICTIM STABBED.
Robbery the Motive for a Deed That
Baffied the Police for
Ten Years.
PORTLAND, Ok., Sept. 28.â A mystery
that had baffled several police administra-
tions here has at last been solved beyond
the peradventure of a doubt, owing to tbtf
unremittisg efforts of Chief of Police
Minto and Detective A. J. Cody. To the
latter' s ingenuity may be attributed the so
lution of a criminal puzzle which has m ysti
' ned the police of the Northwest for almost
ten years. It originated in the murder of
Thomas Kennealey in this city in Novem
ber, 1896. His mutilated body was found
In the "Villard ruins," or what now is the
basement of the Hotel Portland. The
only clew the detectives had at that time,
was a hat they found on Fourth street,
along which Kennealey's bleeding body
was carried prior to its being deposited in
the "Villard ruins." It was a new No. 7
hat, purchased from Gross Bros, in Ta
coma. Detective Simmons was sent there
in the vain hope of having the purchaser
identified by the firm.
Early on the morning of the 6th of last
May a stranger attem-pted to strangle
Marie Lehvre, a French Whitechapel
habitue, and Detective Cody was put. on
the case. John Co sg rove fell under his
euspicion. Cody had been acquainted
with (Josgrove some years- aeo, ana fhe
latter, not knowing that Cody was an
officer, sasily fell into a trap ingeniously
set for him. The detective represented to
Cosgrove that he was out of work and the
puspect allowed him to scare his bed for a
week in a lodging-house on Fourth and
Salmon streets. The detective so com
pletely wormed himself into the suspected
strangler's confidence that he made an
unqualified confession to iiim of his
attempt upon Marie Lelivre's life. Fre
quently during that w;eek Cosgrove, would
start from his fleep anxl placing his hands
before his eyes he would cry out, "Oh, my
God, drive that sight away from me.''
After a little 'careful questioning, Cos
grove unhesitatingly aainitted that the
vrsion troubling his. sleep was ihe death of
Thomas Kennealey, of which he had been
an eye-witness. He'then gave a detailed
account of the ntrocious crime to Detec
tive .-Cody, the raost^alient points of which
â¢Cosgpove detailed to Police Stenographer
Dodsou after his arrest for the strangling
â¢ affair. Two women alleged to have been
: directly concerned m this murder are liv-
Sng-'her,e, but they cannot be convicted on
Cosgroye's unsupported testimony.
Cosgrove stated that the hat found on
"Fourtn street on the morning following
the murder was his. Cosgrove said that
when Kennealey came from Tacoma he
had $3(500 on kis person in a belt. He was
Jo Ho wed by "Bulldog" Kelly, sometimes
known as "King of Spades. Kennealey
registered at a hotel in this city, and the
following morning, about 1 o'clock, he
. .called at a Fourth-street saloon. He had
the money in the belt around his waist.
While there he went into a room with a
' girl and she ordered some drinks. Wben
the barkeeper, Robert Dorner, entered,
â  Kennealey did not-like his appearance, for
"Bob" was a bad-looking man. Kennealey
at once returned to the barroom, in which
â¢at. the time were "Bulldog" Kelly, Fred
' Love and Cosgrove. Kelly tried to get
Keanealey out of the saloon with the in
tention of robbing him. Another woman
: and Dorner, having the same object in
view, knew that if "Bulldog-" Kef/y got
him outside of the place they would lose
the)r opportunity, so they took Kelly into
thefr scheme, agreeing that they would
rob him in the house and divide the pro
ceeds between them.
â¢ Kennealey was doped and taken up
stairs. The woman and Doruer started to
search him, when he awoke. Dorner got
h-im by the throrft and choked him, while
.the woman stabDed him to death, as she
â¢; supposed, when they finished their work
â¢ # of-robbery. The. money was divided be-
Mfeen "Bulldog"" Kellv, the woman, Dor
. ner anil Love, and Cosgrove was given
hush money.
: "I witnessed "the whole proceeding,"
said Cosgrove in conclusion. "I saw the
woman plunge the knife up to the hilt
into the poor fellow several times and it
made me shudder. To tell the truth,
when Kennealey was .dead. Love and I
were compelled to tajie him to the 'Villard
ruins.' We stood him upright, and each
of us threw one of his arms about our
'necks, so as to make it appear as if we
were caring for a drunken man. On the
way my hat dropped -to the sidewalk."
To ascertain the whereabouts of Kelly
and Love Chief Minto was materially as
sisted by the Pinkertons, but the informa
tion so far obtained is very unsatisfactory.
Kelly met with a railroad accident be
tween Spokane and Missoula in 1893, from
which he died ma hospital In the latter
.place. Love is in some unknown peniten
tiary under an assumed name, but the
search for him will not be abandoned.
CONGRESS MINE DISASTER.

SACRAMENTO JAIL-BREAK.
Three Criminals Escape From the County
Prison Yardâ One Recaptured
by Officers.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 28.â Three
desperate criminals, one of whom is well
known as the most notorious pickpocket
on the coast, escaped from the County
Jail this morning, and two of them are
still at liberty.
Shortly after Jailer Beckley had tnrned
his wards at large in the jail yard one of
his trusties came to him and reported the
escape. Beckley gave the alaun, and
Deputy Sheriffs F. J. Smith, Charles
Bchwilk and Ira Conran started in pur
suit. They learned that the men had been
seen running up a neighboring alley, and
eventually touiul one of them hiding be
neath a bush in the grounds surrounding
the residence of Hon. Grove L. Johnson.
Tlie culpiit, a burglar named Frank Mc-
Carty, was captured and returned to t4ie
jail, but absolutely refu-ed to tivc infor
mation as to the whereabouts of his com
rades.
After the return to the jail a search was
instituted, and it was found that the three
had torn up the flooring in one of the
closets and had passed through a natural
tunnel to a deserted closet in the rear of
the Assessor's office. There they scaled
the low wall and dropped into the street.
The two st ill at liberty are William Harri
son, awaiting trial for burglary, and W. J.
Creelman, the pickpocket. As these men
stood on their constitutional rights at the
time of their arrest and refused to be
photographed until after conviction, their
chance for getting away is excellent.

RAILWAY TO BE CASTADA.
JEastern Capitalist* Hack of a Lot Ange
tea Project.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 23.â From
the most reliable information obtainable
on the subject, Los Angeles will soon have
another suburban electric railway. The
new line will run into the fertile and pic
turesque La Canyada Valley, a distance of
twelve miles from this city and three miles
southwest of Pasadena. Dr. J. D. Hine
man, representing Eastern capitalists, has
the enterprise in band.
During the past week a number of meet
ings of the residents of Lv Canyada have
been held, at which Dr. Hineman and his
engineer, Henry Dockweiler, have been
present. It has been uositively announceu
that if the right of way and reasonable
financial aid should be c'ven, work would
begin before November 1. Dr. Hinemau
claims tbat his company is negotiating
with the Terminal people" fcr their road,
the intention being to lay a third rail ana
electncize it. It is believed the intention
is to make a belt line connecting with the
Terminal at the Arroyo Park and the
Verdugo terminus, as "that would make
one of the most beautiful scenic routes in
this part of the State.
T. E. Gibbon, the vice-president of the
Terminal road, said to-day that his com
pany had been approached regarding some
combination arrangement and that while
nothing had been decided upon it was not
impossible that the new proiect would re
ceive the aid of the Terminal, as it would
be in the nature of a feeder.

SUES FOR HER FORTUNE.
Mrs. Irene K. Quinby Alleges That Druggist
Ficfitr Defrauded Her Out of a
Valuable Ranch.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Sept. 23.â Mrs. Irene
K. Quimby to-day began suit in the Su
perior Court against C. \V. Ficher, a well
known druggist of this city, for an ao
coutitinK as business agent Â«i the estate
lett to her by her deceased husband, John
Qiinby. Mrs. Quinby alleges that
Ficher defrauded her out of a ranch
valued at $20,000.
The plaintiff states, in her complaint
that her depeased husband, John Quinby
borrowfld $5600 from the San Jose Safe De
posit Bank of Savings in 1 1887 and gave a
mortgage upon their ranch of 137 acres of
the Yerba Buena Kancho. Shortly after
Quinby's death the mortgage was trans
ferred to Ficher, and lie became Mrs.
Quinby' agent and hail full control of
her affairs. From 1887 to 1890, MrÂ«.
Qainby alleges, : Ficher collected the in
come rom the ranch, which; was not less
than $3500 annually, and at the same
time she paid him $3600 herself to apply
as interest upon the note. Up to 1893, the
plaintiff alleges, the receipts that Fisher
obtained from the ranch and from her
amounted to about $20,000. She says she
was made to believe that the ranch was a
source of expense and had to be continu
ally putting up money.
In about 1893 the "plaintiff moved Into
town from the ranch and she paid $2200 in
cash for a house and lot in the Western
Addition, the transaction being effected
through Fisher as her agent, and the
premises being bought from T. Bolting.
At the time she supposed she was getting
the deed in her name, but when she went
to place ii on record Fisher was found to
be -grantee. "..In explanation the plaintiff
says Fisher told her he had lost the origi
nal deed to her aud had that made in its
stead. .
The dealings were growing more com
plicated, so Mrs. Quinby says, and she de
manded settlement, but could secure none,
and in an effort to straighten out the en
tanglement Mrs. Quinby was led to believe
that it would be equitable for the defend
ant to transfer to the plaintiff the Bolting
property and she should give him a deed
to tue ranch. That was done, but now the
plaintiff wants a reconveyance ana ac
counting for all the profits of the farm and
receipts from her, from wnich she is will
ing to allow the $6630 mortgage to be
taken. .
TO MAKE SMOKELESS POWDER.
Incorporation of a Company That Will
Erect a Manufacturing Plant at
San Jose.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept, 28.â Articles of
incorporation of the Peerless Powder Com
pany were filed with the County Cierk
yesterday afternoon. The capital stock of
the company is $20,000, all subscribed.
The principal place of business is given as
San Jose, and the incorporators, who are
also named as the directors for the first
year, are as follows: Rocca Salomone. P.
Harlata. L. A. Bpinelli, Robert Mental
and H. A. Gabriel.
The purpose of the company is to manu
facture and sell smokeless powder. The
organization of this company is the result
of years of experimental work on the part
of RoccÂ£ Salomonp, who has devoted a
large portion of his life to the study ot
powder. He took a quantity of this pow
der to the United States arsenel at
Benicia and had it tested with the Gov
ernment ordnance guns, both large and
small, under the personal supervision of
Lieutenant Lissalc. One of the tests was
to tire from a 30-ralibre smokeless-powder
rifle 125 shots as rapidly as the weapon
could be discharged and insert a piece of
white cotton into the barrel to ascertain
the amount of dirt. The cotton, it was
claimed, was withdrawn without a particle
of dirt being visible.
After this test the army officers assured
the inventor he had discovered a wonder
ful powder, which far surpassed the
product made at Santa Cruz, which is
used In such large quantities by the Gov
ernment that tlie plant is unable to sup
ply the demand. On the strength of this,
the inventor and his colleagues proceeded
to organize a company to manufacture the
powder in quantities.
Local experts have been given samples
of this powder to test in shotguns and
rirles at various ranges and with different
sizes of shot and bullets, and they have
without exception pronounced it far su
perior to any of the celebrated smokeless
powder now on the market.
AUNTIN A POTI LOSE.
Ordered to Pay the Motet Held by Messrs.
Field and JHndlay. - : :
, SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept, 28.â Judge Rey
nolds this morning gave judgments for
the plaintiffs in the suits brought by
Arthur G. Field and J. W. Findlay against
Paul P. Austin and Fred 8. Pott, who
formerly conducted a real estate and in
surance business in this city under the
firm name of Austin &. Pott, on two notes
aggregating $25,500.
On November 1, 1892, A. G. Field, who
was a real estate and insurance dealer in
this city, disposed oi his business to Auf
tin & Pott for $47,500. Austin & Pott paid
$10,0u0 down in cush and gave their notes
for $37,500. In the course of business Field
assigned $12,500 of the notes held by him
against the defendants to J. W. Findlay.
The defendants claimed that after the
sale of Field's business to them they dis
covered that 650 snares of stock of the
Western Granite Company, which were in
cluded in the purchase, were not worth
nearly the amount r>aid for them. Tuev
had asked of another stockholder, C. T\
Ryland, the value of the shares, and were
informed that they were well worth $,50
each. The defense alleged that Ryland
had misrepresented th- actual situation.
The court held that entire failure of con
sideration had not been shown, and found
for the plaintiff in each case.

OREGON LAWYER'S PLIGHT
Ex-Senator Dolph Intimates That
President Clevelaad Gets
Intoxicated.
His Statements Like y to Call Fcrth
Reproct From the State Bar
Association-
PORTLAND. Or.. Sept. 28.â Ex-United
States Senator Doiph ha? attracted to him
self some unenviable notori-jty and un
pleasant criticism by making some start
ling public intimations that Pre<Ment
Cleveland and his Caoiuet go on sprees
poriodicallr. Because of the unpleasant
uottce that is being taken of it the Sen
ator is being remonstrated with to such an
extent that he has proclaimed, in an ef
fort to get out oi it, that it was a sup of
the tongue in an argument.
Dolph recently appeared before the
board of the Oregon MedTcal Association
to defend Dr. Bigeers, a well-known Baker
City (Or.) physician, who was on trial for
being drunk and using unprofessional and
ungtntkmanly language. The Senator's
statement was thisi
"It would be rather severe to hold that
any professional man who gets drunk oc
casionally â and lota of them do, as we all
knowâ demonstrates inherent baseness of
character. 1 know one of the most promi
nent members of President Cleveland's
Cabinet who goes on a spree now and
then and makes a hee line for the lower
part of the city. I know that a man even
more prominent than he gets intoxicated
occasionally. No divorce is ever granted
on proving merely a sinele case of drunk
enness or even periodical sprees."
It is very probable the Oregon Bar As
sociation will reprove Dolph for his utter
ances as a breach of propriety.
MADERA OUTLAW'S FATE.

MADERA, Cal., Sept. 28.â Judge- Con

half-breed Indian who ' was convicted of
the murder of Pasquale . Milesi two years
ago, in this county, and sentenced him to
San Quentin for the term of his natural
life. '- â.
After the conviction of Haslip, and
while the motion heard to-day was pend
ing, Haslip, in company with "Jimmy"
Lawson and John Love, broke jail and es
caped. He kept out of the reach of the
officers until a month aeo, when he was
decoyed by another Indian to a place
where a Deputy Sheriff awaited him, and
was taken into custody. He claims to
know the whereabouts of the Regan gang
and ' promises to lead officers to their
stronghold if he is released. His attorney
tiled a notice of appeal to the Supreme
Court and the court signed an order of
probable cause staying execution until
the appeal is decided.

â¢
Father Yorke, in bis fifth lecture of the
series of six to be delivered at Metropoli
tan Hall under t&e auspices -of the Ameri
can' Woman's Liberal League, was more
than usually vitriolic last, night. His
subject was "The Growth ot the Upas
.Tree," the name of this noxious and
deadly tree Dewig intended to apoly to the
A. P. A. .
â  Music in the shape of patriotic airs on
the organ opened the exercises. John P.
Bajrett, chairman of the evening, in his
address spoke as follows:
"The first impulse of the American peo
ple -at the approach of peril is high and
. lofty defiance. It is a feeling well
grounded ant deep rooted."
After a tribute to the heroism of those
who fought in the various wars of this
country, he declared that the American
â¢ women were not less heroic when occasion
required a demonstration of: it. He spoke
of the work of the Woman's Liberal
League in exposing the A. P. A., and
added: . '
'â¢By them was the defense of religious
liberty begun, and to themis due a large
share of the glorious victory. -And how
they are doing noble work in that last
and most bungling conspiracyâ the nfcw
charter." â  ; ..'â¢ " "
This instrument, he said, had many
good points, and was advocated by many
of the best men in the community. "One
mischievous provision," he continued,
"overbalances every good point in that j
irrstrument. It attempts to interfere !
with the God - given right of the
parent to control the eaijcatipn
of his child. The charter thus discrimi
nates. Graduates in other schools tban
those of California are prevented from
earning a living in this Stalein the ran ks
of the teacher? in our public schools."
After declaring tnat this provision was
unconstitutional he said the best method
to remedy the wrong contemplated was to
defeat the charter. Then taking a new
theme he said :
"Three years ago we stood face to lace
With a formidable foe arrayed against
the constitution and the church. \% c
were dumb with fear and recognized the
danger. 'Let the tempest waste its fury,'
was the sentiment of all. Already it
had emptied the cupboard of the
poor. Already the demoniac fiend
had dared to whisper its suspicion
of God's best and most beloved. Already
it had ventured the insult which no man
can stand. Up against the multitude rose
a great defenderâ youthful, alone, fresh
from the cloister, but he stood firm and
defiant. We gazed with awe and pity.
He meets the foremost of the leaders
and vanquishes him. Others crush for
ward, but they too are conquered. We
fear for him, but he fights bravely. His
firm blade mightily wielded mows them
down. Confusion spreads among them
and they are routed. [Applause], The
gallant stripling, the watchless warrior,
the consecrated thunderbolt, was Peter C.
Yorke.
"If the day ever comes in this City
when that name ceases to be uppermost
in every heart we shall be recreant and
shall deserve the plague which be
averted."
Before introducing Father Yorfce, Mr.
Barrett stated that next Monday's lecture
by Father Yorke would be "The Great Be
trayal and the A. P. A. Way of Selling a
Gold Mine."
At this juncture Miss Cornelia Stanley
read a series of resolutions adopted at a
recent meeting of the Woman's- Liberal.
League opposing the new charter,.-.princi
pally because of the provision regarding
teachers in the public schools. Th'ie pro
vision, the resolutions declared, was in
serted through the influence of the XP, A.
Father Yorke *poke In substance as fol
lows:
"Ladies and Gentlemen.: In the heat of
.that battle which was so eraphically de-.
'. scribed I was not called so many names as
were applied to. me to-night.
â¢ "Being still afflicted with the prelude
habit, I wisn to call attention to the fact
that the Rev; ' Mr. Fleerior is.* still fleecing
and has not yet â  answered any of my ques
tions. Â©ut|l will take pity on him' and
not ask him any more questions, or tLe

days. . â¢ \ , â¢â¢"
.'"Ntfw the Rev.. Mr. Fleenor has went,
but that little red' patriot. -Major Ti C.
Kyan. has came."
Father Yorke then *cad from a letter
said to -,ha,ve been received from the
secretary of Major William McKinley.
This described Major Ryan as : a
, chronic office-seeker, and went ion
to â¢ say that on the piteous solicitation of
Major Ryan a position had been secured
for him by Major. McKinley in the pen
sion office at 'Columbus, and from which
he bad been dismissed owing to his'in
ability to handle figures correctly. Father
â  Yorke, ajfter- referring to recent attacks
made on the' Republican Presidential
"np^ninee by Ryan, continued as follows:
"Being â very Inaccurate in his. figures,
Major Ryan had to go, and has been going,
ever -since. And this Is the man who
comes out here, to tell the people they are
being Romanized 1 This man, who "bit the
hand that did him good, is the man who
comes out here to stir up Strife. It' is this
. man, who. cannot even doa little sum in
"arithmetic, who comes out here to teil us
about the education of otir children.
"The. subject of the lecture this evening
is 'The Growth of the Upas Tree,' "
He described the deadly influence of" the
noxious fexha'lations of that tree and con
tinued: "There has arisen in this couh
-1 try a growth thrat has had the 'same effect
on morals and politics that this tree is
said to have on.the vegetable kingdom. I
. mean that growth known as tfie A. P. A.
"It is a gobd thing for us to remember
that the fieht I>etween< bigotry and free
dom is not yet 'over. Borne 'little spark
may remain and some passjng ftf-eezfe may
restore it to life. We cannot afford to
sleep on our arms. The fight is still on
and we cannot rest until we make it cer
tain* tiiat the A. P. A. will be* so well
known that for 'any politician to. touch it
will mean defeat. Â» â¢ â 
"Every year the farmer has to contend
with a new crop of weeds and every year
' we have to contend with a new crop of
ignorance. The time "was when children
were taught* that a Catholic was
a dangerous person and one to be
most carefully : avoided. But to-day there
- would-appear to De no excuse for this
â¢ bigotry and this ignorance of us -and our
belief. We have not said one word in the
ear that we would not say in the market
place, and there is no excuse for these
misrepresentations of the Catholic faith
*A have - Deen ?Â° fre( i uentl y made of late.
"Organized bigotry comes into service
whenever there is stagnation or political
agitaiion, and it was during one of these
periods of political stagnation that this
present controversy sprang up.
''We have on bur borders s country
which contains a great many good peo
ple, the dominion of Canada. Unfortu
nately that country has always been
divided by religious strife. This has been
brought here in the track of the Orange
man and the bigot. The leaders of the
A. P. A. are men who have never assim
ilated the principles of the constitution of
the United' State?.
. â¢ "The apostle of the A. P. A. in Cali
fornia was W. J. H. Trainor. He came
out here, went through the State and
then went home and told the barbarians
of the East that the West was uuder the
dominion of the Pope and that Jesuits
occupied every fat ofh'ce.
"Trainor is a Canadian Irishman. God
help us! It's bad enough to liave to
stand Ryan, but it is a terrible thing to
have to bear the reputation of Trainor.
"The Detroit Trainor was a saloon-keeper
in one of the most disreputable portions of
that city. They always rind their level.
After the two houses â of which we had
better not speak â that were on each side
of him had been cleaned out by
the police he closed up his saloon. Then
he became a drummer for a wholesale
liquor house, and afterward published a
paper, which opposed the license ques
tion, against the temperance people.
"It is this man whom the ministers of
this City welcomed and who was the
friend and confrere of J. Q. Ananias Henry
and C. O. Brown. At Detroit he started
the Hotel Reporter and made it the organ
of thieves and others until its publication
was stopped by the police."
In speaking of the Standard, published
by President Hudelson of the American
Protective Association, he said that "last
week it went to its grave unwept, unhon
ored and its editor unhung."
Taylor Rogers, he .-aid, was the man
who started the A. P. A. in this City.
"That man was a fitiing hen to
sit on and incubate such an egg,"
he added; and continued: "The man
who accepts the indorsement of the
A. P. A. is worse than an A. P. A.
We oppose.! Mr. Sutro, and we were
hounded for doing so. The first day he
took his office he appointed Taylor Risers
his secretary, and the first thine Taylor
Rogers rffd'when a few poor women came
to the Mayor's office to beg for some small
pittance of charityâ the first thing Taylor
Rogers"did was to ask them what their re
ligion wan."
Thousands and thousands, ho said, had
been inveigled into joining the American
Protective Association, and after attend
ing one meeting and hearing the oath
each member was required to take they
never attended another.
He read what he explained was the A.
P. A. oath. It pledged the members of
the organization, he dec'ared, to proscribe
Catholics politically and commercially.
Then to emphasize his assertion he said:
. "At the last election James Budd and
M. M. Estee were candidates for the Gov
ernorship of- this State. Estee had the
misfortune to Uave a Catholic type
writer. The members of the A. P. A.
dared to go to him and tell him to dis
miss his typewriter or he would be put
undeF the ban. tie was man enough to
tell them to go to Halifax â or some
warn.ier place.
"Befoie the last election some 11,000 men
were induced to sign their roll and then,
thank God. the advisory board sold out
the . 11.000. After the election they
started fighting and have Deen keeping it
nip-ever since.
"Were it not that one of their number
secured an office of patronage, were it noi
th,at Coun-ty Clerk Curry was successful in
that flection, many of the members of the
A. P. A. wouid have had to starve.
"The object of that American Protec
tive Society is proscription on account of
religious belief. While all the newspapers
of this City, know this, there was not a
man among .them brave enough to say a
word agaihst.it. They weie dumb then,
ard they are dumb to-day gazing at its
rotting carcass.
"One of them went out of his way to
help them. Mr. J. P. Young [hisses]
in the San Francisco Chronicle al
lowed the blackguards to dump their
filth into it, as it was, and is, a dump
ing ground, and then refused us
the" chance to shovel the offal from be
fore our door. To J. P. Young belongs
the bad eminence of doing more to foster
and fatten the A. P. A. than any other
single influence. Its swaddling clothes
were the Chronicle and its corpse clothes
may be the Chronicle.
"The other day there was a convention
in this town, of winch the chairman was
T. D. Riordan. When some one in the
-hall shouted that a candidate wa=? an A.
P. A., Mr. Riordan said that that conven
tion knew nothing of the A. P. A. nor did
he. He had better change his name to
Rip Van- Winkle Riordan if he knows
nothing of the politics of this City for the
last two years.
"The nominee of that convention for
Mayor was a Mr. Taylor. As far as I
know about Mr. Taylor, he would not be
guilty of the things charged againstthe
A. P. A. T exefore, to-night I wish to
put a question to him which I think he
should .answer.
"At present among the A. P. A. circles
there is a grave dispute as to which is the
.dog. ;fnd which the 1 taii, and whether the
dog is wagging the tail or the tail is
â¢wagging tfife dog. I do not intend to settle
the dispute, but this Convention, com
posed of the members of the A. P. A., has
presented forJNlayor' Mr. Taylor. As yet
they have 'not formally notified him. He
has .not accepted their nomination. It is
quite possible that they offered him the
nomination without 'asking by and with
his leave. It is known that they have in
dorsed men in order to beat them.
"If he accepts the nomination of that
certain convention â if he accepts the nom
ination of the .so-called Citizens'
party â be- said he was willing to
accept the .nominations of all
classes of men â I do not think
he knows the class of men with whom
he is dealing. The men who nominated
him are -the men who are at the head of
the A. P. A. I now ask him, in the name
of the citizens here assembled :ind of this
City, if be will accept this indorsement?"
Before the. last election, he said, the
A. P. A. distributed printed circulars giv
inrthe various parties and their candi
dates with their religious belief. Protest
ants were marked -with a star and Catho
lics with a dagger.
"Mr. Taylor must remember," he went
on, "fchat.the men who indorsed him are
pledged to- elect a Legislature that will
pass a law providing that all chil
dren must be sent to the public
schools at least three months every
year, and that will endeavor to restrict
immigration by excluding the Papist,
pauper criminal hordes of Europe. No
man of spirit but will give a pledge to
oppose these bigoted, proscriptive methods
aimed at th- Catholic church. Therefore
ami -pushing Mr. Taylor to the wall."
George W. Elder "and County Clerk
Curry came In for criticism and were
charged with being A. P. A.'s.
Referring to the alleged concessions
made to the A. P. A. by the various con
ventions, he said: "Tney do these things
not because they love the A. P. A., but be
cause the A. P. A. has votes. Let it be
our resolve and the resolve of every
honest man that no party can touch
the A., P. A. and be successful. I am
making no man's fight. I do not care
who is elected to puolic office because I
expect nothing and I will ask nothing. I
have no money to make. I havo no am
bition to subserve. But I have this one
thing tor gam and this one thing to strive
for. and I believe you will strengthen my
hands: that no A. P. A. and no A P A
indorsee shall lord it in office."
The speaker's concluding words were
' Let the object of our endeavors be to
speak for the constitution of the United
States and the commandments of God
They are always on the one side; they are
on the side of justice, liberty and truth "

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1896.
REV, DR, RADER
IS TO REMAIN
The Third Church Will
Now Begin Institu
tional Work.
HEADQUARTERS NEEDED
Congregationalists Are to Co-
Operate in Securing a
Local Center.
METHODISTS TO HONOR LUTHER
Reso utions of Respect for the Late
Rev. Mr. M. F. Ccl
burn.
"The Congregationalists are feeling more
and more the urgent need for headquar
ters. It has almost become necessary for
tis to have a business office where we can
find a center."
It was in introducing a motion tending
to the establishment of a permanent head
quarters that Rev. Hyman Hood made
this statement to the Congregational Mon
day Club yesterday. There was a full at
tendance of lay and clerical members pres
ent, and all Mr. Hood's remarks were
heartily indorsed. His motion, which was
carried unanimously, was to invite the
following officers, agents, secretaries and
societies of the Congregational churches
to unite in renting, furnishing and sus
taining of rooms adequate for their several
purnoses and needs: The proprietor and
managing editor of the Pacific, the Con
gregational Club, the superintendent of
the Congregational Missionary Home; the
Rev.J. K. Harrison.the agent of the Ame
rican Board of Commissioners of Foreign
Missions; Rev. W. Freer, superintendent
Congregational Sunday? school and Publish
ing Company; Rev.L. LWirt, the lield sec
retary Congregational Church Building
Society; Rev. H. H. Wikoff ; the Northern
California State Woman's Home Mission
Society, the Woman's Board of the Pacific ;
Mrs. H. E. JewÂ«"tt, president of the Con
gregational Ministerial Relief Society ;
Rev. George Mooar, president of the Cali
fornia Missions; the Auxiliary American
Missionary Association, Jtlev. J. K. Mc-
Lean.
All the above organizations and people
will be communicated with by the officers
of the Monday Club as early as possible,
and the hope was freely indulged in yes
terJay by the members of the club that
the initiative they are taking will soon
result in the Congregationalists of this
City having permanent headquarters for
the transaction of all business of interest
to their denomination.
The Monday Club was addressed yester
day by Rev. B. F. Sargent on tne theme
"Faithfulness in the Lord's Service and
Its Kmal Reward." Among those present
who discussed the paper were Rev. Philip
Coombe, Professor Baldwin, Rev. Dr.
Wood, Rev. Dr. McLean, Rev. Dr. Chap
man, Professor Ford, Pastor .Birch and
Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper. A short address
was given by Rev. Dr. Temple of Seattle,
who was present as a visitor.
RÂ»Â»v. William Rader will to-day cele
brate the first anniversary of his anpoint
ment to the pastorate of the Third Congre
gational Church. His congregation, at
the annual meeting, el d him per
manent pastor of thechurcn, and to-night
a reception will be tendered him by his
parishioners in honor of the event. Now
that Rev. William Rader Is thoroughly
identified with the work of the Third Con
gregational Church, he intends to branch
out further on institutional lines. Classes
for study in connection with the church
are being organized. Two German classes
have already been formed and there will
soon be a class of Christian Endeavorers
engaged in Biblical study.
Methodist Preacher*.
Rev. Dr. Soper, who has been a mission
ary for many years in Japan, gave an
address to the Methodist Ministers' Club
yesterday on life in Japan. The death of
Rev. Dr. Colburn was discussed and the
following resolutions were unanimously
adopted :
Whereas, The Rev. Marcus F. Colburn, the
highly esteemed pastor of GrÃce Methodist
Episcopal Church of this City, has been sud
denly calle 1 from the labors of his mfulstry to
his eternal crown of rejoicing; therefore
Hesolred, That we record our deep sense of
lost* in the death of Brother Colburn and rec
ognize in him a true Christian brotner and
hold him in the highest esteem as a pure
minded nnd heroic worker and that we will
ever hold him in most precious memory.
red. That our sympathy is hereby ex
tended to the members of Grace Church in this,
their great loss in the death of their pastor.
Another subject which occupied the at
tention of the Methodist pastors was the
Luther anniversary, which will occur
October 30. It was decided to call on all
the evangelical organizations in the City
to help in making an event of the cele
bration. Dr. Harris, Dr. Dille and Dr.
Case wcTe appointed a committee to con
fer with pastors of other denominations
and help to arrange an inspiring pro
gramme. It is intended to hold the cele
bration in some large church or public
building in the City.
The following officers for the Methodist
Preachers' Club were elected for the com
ing six months: President, Rev. F. T.
Masters, D. D. ; vice-president, Rev. U. F.
Matthews, D.D. ; secretary. Rev. D. W.
Chilson of the Potrero M. E. Church; pro
gramme committee â Rev. S. T. Carroll
D.D.; Rev. G. W. Beatty, Rev. F. K.
Baker.
The announcement is made that Bishop
Newman, the new Methodist Episcopal
Bishop, will address the United Preachers'
meetings at the Young Men's Christian
Association building December 7.
Presbyterian Union.
Rev. O. J. Miller of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church addressed the Presby
terian Ministerial Union yesterday on
"The Ministry of Power." He said that
a minister's sufficiency could come only of
God and drew a vivid picture of the work
that could be accomplished by a conse
crated ministry. "How can we go forth
to preach unless we have the spirit of
God?" asked Mr. Miller, and he added
that a crucified ministry, one baptized
unto sorrows and sufferings, should and
could perform miracles aa the apostles
performed them.
WANT TO REORGANIZE.
Pastors Hennlnar and Birch Will
Preach In a Tent.
Rev. W. G. Henning, a well-known
Congregational pastor of Oakland, and
Rev. William Birch have decided to co
operate in church work. They will open
the Populist tent on Market street next
Sunday for non-sectarian services and will
call it the Church of the New Era. The
inaugural a<ldros9 will be made by Rev.
W. Birch and Rev. J. E. Scott. The latter
gentleman is a well-known Presbyterian
clergyman of this Cily who started a
weekly paper some time aeo on socialistic
lines.
It is stated that s number of influential
people are interested in the Church of the
New Era. It is not intended to have any
organization beyond a president, who will
be elected next Sunday. Pastors Birch
and Henning state that in about a month
they hope to hire a ball on Barbary Coast
and nse it as a branch church of tne New
Era. One feature of the new departure
will be that after service there will be a
parliament for the discussion of topics of
interest to the community. All visitors
will be allowed to speak in the parlia
ment
AT THE CITY THEATERS.
" Shadows of a Great City " Seen
With a New Hero at
the Grand.
Pretty Schoolgirls at the Alcazar.
Frawleys in " The Lost
Paradise."
The company at the Grand was more in
its element last night in "Shadows of a
Great City" than it had been the previous
week in "Mr. Potter of Texas." The play
has plenty of melodramatic situations and
it contains opportunities for scenic display
which are not to be found in the drama
founded on Gunter's book. Melodramatic
scenes and pieces of startling stage
mechanism are the specialty of Manager
Morocco's regime, and last night the audi
ence had its moneys worth of both. The
boat scene, with real water, was a particu
larly good piece of staging.
Frawley's Farewell Week.
At the Columbia last night Blanche Bates
not only made love to Dan.Frawley, the stage
superintenJent of a big factory, but she did it
in such a way that she knocked out the strike
and started the factory .whistlesâ in other
words set all hands 10 work with a 15 per
cent advance in their wages.
A pretty good night's wont for one girl. It
was in the play called "The Lost Paradise," a
name that seemed to Have lodged on the piece
oy accident. However, the Frawleys chose it
for their farewell week and did very well.
Alcazar Theater.
A good performance of "School" was given
at the Alcazar last night. Robertsonian com-
edy demands above all things refinement, and
the Alcazar stocit company has enough fin
ished players in its ranks to make a play like
"School" bo well.
One of the special features last night was
the presence of a number ot fresh young girls,
who made lhe scenes go with plenty of spirit
and who worried the professor with true
schoolgirl energy.
Tivoll Opera-Home,
"Aida" was given last night at the Tlvoli,
with the star performers in the cast. Mme.
Natali sang the title role, Bcrnice Holmes
played Amneris, Fernando Micbelena was the
Kadamcs, and Maurice de Vries and Abramoff
completed the fine cast. Tne opera is beauti
fully staged and is well worth seeing.
To-night the alternate singers will appear in
"Aida."
At the Chutes.
They have a novely out at the Halght-street
grounds in the form of Delmer, the "Man
Frog," who performs the rather undiÃnified
but funny act of coming down the chutes on
all toart, jumping on an island flouting in the
lake and going through the most extraordinary
contortions.
At the Orpheum.
The Orpheum bill for this week contains the
Hawaiian National Band and a new vaude

Progress of the Citizens' Inde
pendent Convention in
Its Labors.
Candidates Decline and Are Fulled
Downâ Others Substituted in
Their Places.
The Citizens' Independent convention
held another of its protracted sessions last
night.
Having swept aside the debris left from
last week's sittings the convention started
in to put the ticket into shape by nomin
ating the following officers:
City and County Attorney, J. R. Aitken;
Justices ot the Peaceâ J. Kerrigan, G. W. F.
Cook: Police Judgesâ W. A. S. Nicholson, H.
L. Jonchimsen; Superintendent of Schools, R.
H. Webster; School Directorsâ Gustav Peter
son, tanner, on Twenty-ninth street; Richard
Penqrally. 519 Arisansas street, employed in
the Union Iron Works.
One of these has been nominated instead
of rf. E. Dutton, who declined.
The same course was taken with the As
semblyman irom the Forty-fourth Dis
trict, where Joseph Martinoni was taken
down and Joseph Marani substituted in
his place.
It is t lie intention of the deiepates to
finish their labors at to-night's sitting and
appoint a connty committee preparatory
to a continuation of the organization as
one of the political elements of the City.
MUNICIPAL TICKET
HAS BEEN RECEIVED,
CbntinHtd from I^rtt Page.
to reserve his decision on the filing of certifi
cates of nomination for municipal candidates
for office in the City and County of San Fran
cisco was delivered to me this forenoon.
The following extract from section 1192 of
the Political Code presents the duties of the
Registrar in reference to filing certificates of
nominations:
"Whenever any certificate of nomination Is
presented for filing to any officer authorized
to file the same, such officer shall forthwith,
upon receipt of the same and before filing, ex
amine the same, and if there is any defect,
omission or reason why the same should
not be filed such officer shall then
and there forthwith designate in writ
ing the defects, omission or -reason
why such certificates cannot be filed, and re
turn the said certificate to the person present
ing the same, with such written designation of
defect, omission or reason for not filing the
same."
It Is evident from this section that the Regis
trar cannot grant the de!ay desired.
The right to filing must be determined by
the political status of the applicant at the time
of presenting his certificate of nomination. The
action of another convention meeting to-night
could not possibly affect the rights of a candi
date of a convention which nominated its
ticket on Saturday night last, bo that no bene
ficial result* can be obtained by delay. Yours
respectfully, W. M. Hinton, Registrar.
At 10 o'clock in the evening Thomns D.
Riordan, J. Alva Watt, Alexander Tru
man and County Clerk Carry called
upon the Registrar in his office, the
Registrar being a very hard working man,
and Mr. Hinton, without any formality,
announced that he had made np his mind
to accept and tile the municipal ticket
nominated by the Auditorium convention
last Saturday night, but that he had taken
the legislative ticket under advisement.
"If the Kelly-Mahoney people bring in
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
their certificates to-morrow they will not
be entitled to file them as the Republican
ticket?" was asked.
"No," replied Mr. riinton, "but they
may file as National Republicans or by
any other name they choose if the law is
complied with. There cannot be two
tickets of the same party name in the field
at the same time."
Republicans were jubilant last night
over the fact of the acceptance of the
ticket of the regular Republican Conven
tion.
They were confident all along that the
Registrar would take this course, because
there was no eetting behind the title of
the County Committee that called the
convention and of the convention itself.
National Repub leans.
The executive and finance committees
of the National Republican League met
last evening at the Pioneer building, Pres
ident Tirey L. Ford in the chair. The fol
lowing resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That this club is organized and
conducted upon National lines and devoted
to the success of the RepuDlican Presidential
Electors in this State. The work undertaken
by the club is entirely with the laboring class
of this City.
The finance committee was filled and
now consists of Colonel William Mac
donald, Colonel George Stone, Colonel Al
bert E. Castle, Commodore Dan T. Cole,
General S. W. Backus and Colonel T. C.
Masteller.
These gentlemen were authorized to
draft a letter stating that the National
Republican Leagun was allied with no
local faction and was working solely for
the National ticket.
Spanish-American Bally.
The Republican rally at California Hall
last evening under the auspices of the
Spanish-American Republican League was
large and enthusiastic. Thomas B.
O'Brien, the nominee for Congress, re
ceived a warm greeting. He vigorously
denounced Congressman Maguire, and
declared his determination to prosecute
his pursuit of the office for which he was
nominated with tireless energy.
Ohio Headquarters.
The Ohio Republican Club headquarters
are located on the first floor of the Cali
fornia Hotel. The secretary, L. P. Mc-
Carthy, will be pleased to meet any one
from the Buckeye State, from 10 a.m. to
12 m. and from 1 to 3 p. h. and 7 to 8 p. m.,
week days.

The Mahoney- Kelly convention con

die, causing Mahoney to raise his voice for

out:
"Sine die, never! Adjourn to the call
of the chair."
The amendment was carried.
In the regular order of business came up

San Francisco, Cal., . â¢ ' â¢
September 25, 1896.-
I, Mrs. Agnes Feely, living at
Silver Heights, San Francisco,
desire to say that I brought my
child, Agnes, aged 12 years, to
the office of Dr. F. L. Sweany,
737 Market street, S. F., she
being afflicted with a malady of
the right eye. I had previously
taken her to our family doctor,
who said he was at a -loss to say
what the precise trouble was, or
how to remedy it. Doctor
Sweany at once stated my
child's case to be one of kera-
titis. My child was totally blind
in that eye at the first visit,
September 18, 1896. Now, on
September 25, she can see per-
fectly out of the eye. I heartily,
appreciate the rapid cure of this
serious eye affection, a great
matter for a child anxious to
pursue school studies, and I
have offered to testify this much
on behalf 'of kindness and skill
so effectively rendered by Dr.
Sweany.
MRS. AGGIE FEELY,
Silver Heights, City. â¢
Thousands of similar -genuine
and unsolicited testimonials on
file at Dr. Sweany 's private of-
fice. NOTIECâ No names or
testimonials will be . published
without request from patient.
All dealings and correspondence
strictly confidential. Any suf-
ferer in doubt should see some
of these people or some of Dr.
S.s private testimonials at his
office. He has the best testi-
monials on earth of cures of all
diseases,. especially of Lost Man-
hood and Nervous Debility.
You can be convinced.

REGULAR REPUBLICAN TICKET.
Registrar Ilinton yesterday officially
recognized the ticket put forth by the Au
ditorium convention as the Regular Re
publican tickot, and entitled as such to a
place upon tbe official ballot.
This act of an honest and impartial offi
cer, takentafter full deliberation, and done
in accordance with the duty imposed
upon him by the Australian ballot law,
should set at rest now and hereafter the
question as to which is the Regular Re
publican, party of the City of San Fran
cisco, and should bring every loyal Re
publican to the support of its official
ticket.
The action of Registrar Uinton should
aiso put an end to the factional conten
tions of the local campaign. There is
only jt month remaining before election
day, and not another hour of it ought to
be. spent in wrangling. The time for
effective and united effort for pnrty suo
cess is all too brief for further dissensions.
Not only should no new elements of dis
cord be introduced but every old difficulty
should be at once eliminated and the
common banner of Republicanism be
lifted by all who honestly desire a Re
publican local and .National victory.
You can make free-silver men see, from the
financial history of rvrry nation that ever
tried it, that whi/e making more money does
inflate prices, it works both ways. It raises
prices for what they have to buy as well an
for what they have to sell, and is apt to raise
the former first and highest. The grocer
raises his figures long before the day laborer
can have his wages advanced ; and the laborer
never really catches up till the inevitable
crctih comes and both tumble together. Cheap
money never did cheapen the necessities of
life; but it cheapens the 7>ien. Look at Mex
ico, and China, and India. â Whitelaw Reid.
THE REPUBLICAN SITUATION IN
SAN FRANCISCO.
When the State Central Committee
comes to consider the affairs of the party
in San Francisco it will lind the party or
ganization opposed by a set of men whose
opposition has been aided by Buckley, by
Rainey and by Willie Hearst. At war
with one another on every other subject
the leaders of all the factions of demoral
ized Democracy are united in a desire to
beat the Republican ticket. Tbe com
mittee will see that the situation calls for
prompt and resolute action. The party
organization must be sustained and all
loyal Republicans must be called to the
support of the Tegular ticket.
It is not worth while to question mo
tives. The .main thing is to understand
actions and see to what results they tend.
It matters little whether the desire of
"Buckley, Rainey and Heurst to beat the
Republican ticket arises from some secret
understanding among them, or is the out
come of "pure cussedness" â the instinc
tive opposition of boodlers to Rood gov
ernment in San Francisco. In either case
it is clear that the hope of good govern
ment rests upon Republican success at
the polls. To that success the State Cen
tral Committee should contribute by every
means in its power. All efforts should be
directed to bring back all wandering Re
publicans to the party fold and to infuse
into the minds of the loyal a more reso
lute determination to maintain the Re
publican organization of the county and
carry it to victory.
The rank and file of the Democratic
party has been completely demoralized by
its faction fights, but the bosses have lost
none of their cunning. Buckley has
managed to get a ticket of his own, Rainey
has a ticket of his own and Hearst is try
ing to play the Non-Partisans as his fake.
All of these ltaders know that as against
a nnited Republican party they have no
chance whatever. It is their plan to have
two Republican tickets in the held and if
possible three. An> T Republican who feels
himself better than the party organization
and favors another ticket will receive their
encouragement.
That is the situation in San Francisco.
It is thoroughly understood by the people.
The plain issue in the election is between
a city government representative of tbe
policies and the ciliz enship of San Fran
cisco Republicans and one which represents
BucKley or Rainey or Kelly or the Willie
Hearst pull, and that pull may have at
tachments to all of the other bosses. The
people of San Francisco desire an admin
istration devoted to the public welfare.
They are aware they can obtain it in this
contest only by the election of the ticket
headed by Charles L. Taylor. It is tntre
fore in the interest of good citizenship as
we:l as good partisanship that the Slate
Central Committee should act lirnily in
supporting the organization of the parly
against bolters and traitors.
Does any loyal Repuolican question
which was the regular Republican County
Convention and which is the regular Re
publican ticket? The regular County
Convention was that presided over by
Tbomas D. Riordau. The regular Repub
lican county ticket is that headed by
Colonel Charles L. Taylor, and officially
recognized as such by Registrar Hinton.
The Republican State Central Commit
tee will not seek to destroy but will en
deavor to preserve party organization.
It will not turn the party over to Boss
Kelly <t Co., with whom and wlm-e
methods this City is too well acquainted.
A depreciation of the currency is always
attended by a loss to the laboring classes.
This portion of the community have neither
time nor opportunity to watch the ebbs and
flows of the money market. Engaged from
day to day in their usefut toih, they do not
perceive thai, although their wages are Jiomi
nally the same, or even someuhnt higher,
they are greatly reduced, in fact, by the
rapid increase of currency, which, as it ap
pears to make money abound, they are at
first inclined to consider a blessing. â Andrew
â¢ Jackson.
THE REASON WHY.
The reason why the candidacy of Mr.
Bryan is losing in public favor is because
the more he analyzes his theories tbe
more satisfied the people are that there
would be risk to the interests of tbe coun
try in giving practical application to
them.- The people want better and
stronger conditions than they have had
the last threÂ« years, and Mr. Brvan has
thus far failed to show wherein his policy
would strengthen the channels of busi
ness.
If tbe people could be convinced that
free and unlimited coinage of silver, inde
pendent of other commercial nations,
would advance and maintain the bullion
price of the white metal to its coinage
value, no doubt tho vote for it would in
clude all business interests; but neither
Mr. Bryan nor one of his supporters has
presented a single reason why such would
obtain. The logic of the law of commodity
interchange and tbe experience of com
merce are that no such results would fol
low; and as no free-silver advocate bus
suggested a reasonable plan for the Na
tion to enter upon a double standard of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1896.
money Independent of those with whom
we have financial operations, the people
are concluding that it would not be wise
to apply Mr. Brvan's crude and uncertain
theories. "Let us try the experiment,"
is what Mr. Bryan says, and because he
will not say why he should be permitted
to experiment with the business concerns
of the Nation the people are turning away
from him.
If Mr. Bryan could convince the people
that no business disturbance would follow
his election tho people would at least
listen to him with patience, but be says
himself that a business panic would come
as the result of introducing his theories
in the conduct of the Government, and
although he says good times would come
after awhile there is an element of chauco
in his purpose which the people do not
care to court.
Mr. Bryan has failed to satisfy the peo
ple that a nearer approach to free trade
would cause the industries of the country
to open to labor employment. They
know that the degree of free trade which
the Wilson-Gorman acts affords has seri
ously injured all the fields of labor, ana
Mr. Bryan does not explain how a still
ereater decree is going to protect this
country against hurtful foreign competi
tion. In short, Mr. Bryan has failed to
give a sinele reaÂ«on why the people
should depart from the ways which have
made the Nation rich and powerful and
adopt his untried and at best uncertain
Policy, and naturally, therefore, the peo
ple wouhl turn away from him. Mr.
Bryan ha 9 failed to give a single reason
why any one should vote for him.
To pay the National debt in silver; to pay
private debts in silver; to nullify and declare
invalid any contract, however freely and
honest hf entered into, for paying gold, and to
turn 53 cents' worth of silver into a dollar at
our mints as often and as long as any silver*
mine owner at home or any silver-burdened
Chinaman or Hindoo from Asia chooses to
bring it to us; the effect of all thi* is simple
robbery. To ask intelligent and honest men
to vote for it is to insult them, as we'l as to
declare that the American people have the
right to overrtcle Mount Sinai at the polls,
and reverse the moral law if they want to. â
Whitelaw licvl.
CHAIRMAN M'LAUGHLIN.
In all the controversy over the selection
of the Republican ticket in this County it
is worth noting that no complaint lias
been madu on either side of the manage
ment of the campaign by Major McLaugh
lin.
He has. shown an earnest desire to pro
mole harmony in the ranks of the party,
and has been wisely impartial. The ad
vice given by him last week, that both
county conventions should postpone nom
inations until yesterday, was undoubtedly
intended in the interest of tbe general wel
fare, and if the regular convention, pre
sided over by the Hon. Thomas D. Riordan,
did not follow the counsel it was from no
lack of appreciation of the motives which
prompted it.
Tbe advice of Major McLaughlin was
not strictly followed because after full
consideration it was seen nothing could be
gained by delay. Had the Auditorium
convention postponed its nominations
the result would not have been
different from what has taken
place. That convention represented
the organized Republicans of San Fran
] cisco. It could do nothing else than
I maintain faithfully the rules of tlie party.
It named a full ticket at once, as in dnty
bound, but renders to-day full and loyal
support to Major McLaughlin in his work
of carrying on the State campaign.
Aside from the financial delusions of the
Chicago platform, its other features are
almost equally objectionable. It proposes to
repudiate in great part the National debt, to
the distress of thousands, whose small re
sources are intrxuted to the faith of the
Nation, and to the dishonor of our country
in the eyef of the world; to destroy the pro
tection tee enjoy under the Supreme Court of
the United States, the most honored, and in
the last resort the most necessary, institution
we have; to restrain the arm of the National
Executive from the repression oj lawless vio
lence, and even from the preservation of the
very agencies of the Government itself; to
violate the obligation and sanctity of existing
contracts and to restrict the freedom of private
contracts in the future. It seeks, in short, to
break rfwn the dikes tehich the constitution
and the law of the land have with long and
laborious assiduity raised for the defense of
the common interests and welfare, and to let
in upon us the seething and polluted flood of
cnvimunism, mob law, bankruptcy, repudia
tion and anarchy, which is the chief object of
all civilized govrrnments to exclude.â Edward
J. Phetps, ex-Minialer to England.
T. V. CATOR, ECONOMIST.
The Pooocrats of California should get
together and agree upon a confession of
faith. They are not agreed as to how free
coinage independent of other nations
would shower blessings upon the people
of tuis country. Take the opinion of
T. V, Cator. for instance. He said in his
Metropolitan Hall speech the other night
if foreigners tried to dump their silver
into this country "they would bare to
take it to the mint and have it coined
into American dollarsâ dollars of no use
abroad and which they would have to
spend in this country." That is it exactly.
Mr. Cator is commendably honest and
frank. That is just wnat foreign owners
of silver would do with it, but does not
Mr. Cator himself warn our people to pre
vent foreieners doing that very thing?
Not directly, to be sure, but that is the
losic of his reasoning.
Mr. Cator admits that such silver dol
lars would be of no use abroad, aud that
they would have to be spent in this coun
try. The meaning of Mr. Cator s philoso
phy is that foreign silver coming to this
country for coinage would have to be
spent in this country when converted into
dollars, because such dollars would nave
a value of only half their stamped value
in other countries. Therefore, when such
dollars were invested in American wheat
at say $1 a bushel, would not the wheat
stand at a cost of 50 cents a bushel when
it reached Liverpool? .
Mr. Cator says silver dollars coined in
America independent of the monetary
systems of otner countries would be of no
use in other countries as dollars, but, of
course.they would have a bullion value.and
Mr. Cator is exactly right, but why should
this country oblige our people to accept a
thing for 100 cents for their produce when
the purchaser of the produce pays only 50
cents for the thing? Mr. Cator also ad
mits, by inference at least, that after we
have accepted these dollars as being tbe
equivalent of 100 cents we would have to
pay them out as the equivalent of only 60
cents in transactions with foreign peoples.
Would that be a good thing for us?
But Mr. Cator says such an arrangement
would increase the circulation of such dol
lays in this country, which is undoubtedly
true, but according to his own show-
Ing not one of them would be
accepted for more that 50 cents in the
payment for coffee and other articles of
consumption wnich we have to go abroad
for. Under such a financial system would
we not .have to pay twice the foreign mar
ket quotation if we paid in American sil
ver dollars? The logic of Mr. Ca tor's ar
gument is that we would. Then if a thing
that is worth 50 cents in Europe can be
brought over here, stamped and exchanged
for what is worth 100 cents in Europe,
who is profited?' Certainly not the one
who accepts 50 cents as the equivalent of
100 cents. _ _^__^_^__
Th* proposition for free and unlimited
silver coinage, carried to its logical conclusion
â and but one m possibleâ means as before
intimated, legislative warrant for the repudi
ation of all existing indebtedness, public and
private, to the extent of nearly 60 per cent of
the face of such indebtedness. It demands
an unlimited volume of fiat currency, irre
deemable, and therefore without any standard
value in the markets of the world. , Every
consideration of the public interest and pub
lic honor demands that this proposition should
be rejected by the American people.â Garret
A. llobart.
WORKINGMEN INSULTED.
It is unfortunate for the good name of
the people of the United States that a
great political party should have selected
a man as its candidate for the Presidency
whose sense of honor is so pliable as is
Mr. Bryan's. The man does not hesitate
to advise the employment of the most
disreputable method?, nor is be at all
backward in commending his nefarious
schemes to others. In addressing a crowd
the other day he noticed that quite a large
number of worfcingmen were wearing
the McKinley button. He immediately
jumped to the conclusion that as a matter
of course they had been coerced into wear
ing it by their employers, and in order to
show Ins deep interest In their welfare he
volunteered a bit of advice which ought to
insure him the contempt of every honest
workingman in the country.
In the most confidential manner he told
the wearers of the McKinley button that
they should not do anything to endanger
their jobs; that they should keep right on
parading the McKinley button; that they
should contribute their campaign fund to
the McKinley collectors, and to deport
themselves as zealous supporters of the
Republican candidate, but on election day
they should secretly use a pencil and
scratch the McKinley elector-. He told
them that it was all right to be Republi
cans and shout for McKinley every day of
the campaign, but on election day they
should quietly slip a Bryan ticket into the
ballot-box.
Aside from Mr. Bryan's purpose what
do working people generally think of
a man who holds their class to be persons
wholly devoid of honesty? He seems to
think it nothing for a wage-earner to live
a shameless falsehood. He does not re
gard workingmen as persons who would
be loyal to tbe principles of any outward
or public declaration if it suited their pur
pose better to play the hypocrite. Play
the hypocrite openly 36t days in the year,
but on the 365 th day secretly sneak in a
vote that contradicts everything that had
been said daring the year. That is the
code of ethics Mr. Bryan thinks is the kind
for workingmen to adopt for their rule of
conduct.
The following is the full text of what
Mr. Bryan said to the wage-earners who
wore McKinley buttons on the occasion
referred to: "I will not ask him to do any
thing that will endanger that position (of
employment). Let him wear the opposi
tion button if he will. Let him enroll bis
name on their club list. Let him con
tribute to their campaign fund if he will
it, but let him remember there is one day
in the year when he is his own master and
can use a pencil as he pleases. lam will
ing for you to be Republicans. Xam will
ing for you to be Republicans every other
day in the year if you will ju*t be Demo
crats on election day."

A HANDSOME CAPE.
Of all toe different length capes of this sea
son tbe one shown here is the most popular for
dressy capes. It is cat circular, thus avoiding
seams and making a delightful model for the
home dressmaker. Of course if narrow goods
such as satin is used a seam in the center back
is necessary. The goods and lining may be
laid ff.ee to face, stitched around the bottom,
and the fronts in a seam turned right side out
and pressed. An interlining of flannel v of
one of the many fiber interliuing9 may be
stitched in if the extra warmth is wished.
Ruffles oi black lace adorn the cape of black
satin shown here. It meets in front, but is
tnrowo back in the illustration to show the
waist.
Collars of net or chiffon heavily spangled
make a dressy garment over black satin.
These make a eood trimming where ills neces
sary to save labor, for they may be had in end
less variety of designs and prices. A wide
ribbon gathered through the center makes a
fashionable finish for the neck, but it must be
very full, at least two and a halt yards being
needed for the rnche alone, with one and a
hail to two yards for a bow if one is desired.

FOURTEEN DESPAIRING BRIDES.
Westminster Gazette, Sept. 10.
At Hounslow yesterday there, was a remark
able scene when the Fourth Hussars left by
the 9 :45 train for Southampton en route for
India. A detachment of 400 men, in full
marching order and under the command of
Colonel Ramsey, proceeded from Hounslow
Barracks to the railway station, where
they were awaited by an immense
crowd, chiefly females. Among the latter
were fourteen brides of only a. week's ex
perience of married life, and these were in a
most distressed condition, the poor women
crowding together and clinging with the
tondest affection to their husbands. The
soldiers quickly entrained, and after the last
good-bys had been spoken the train steamed
out of the station, leaving the disconsolate
brides weei>ing hysterically in a heap on the
platform. The fourteen privates were mar
ried during the previous week without the
consent of the colonel, and tneir wives were
therefore not entitled to accompany them.

age, but the mint charge is 1 per cent. The
debts.of India require the annual export of
$80,300,000. The price of silver, however,
dropped so low in 1892 that this amount was
increased by over $51,100,000 in payments of
gold premium's. This fall in silver led to the
closing of the mints to silver on June 26,1893, â¢

siderable numbers, migrated into Arabia alter
the destruction of Jerusalem and made many
proselytes, especially in Yemen. This diver
sity of creeds was favorable to the introduc
tion of the doctrines of Mohammed, which,
forms the -grand epoch in Arabian history and
brings It ljito' close connection with th<* gen
eral history of civilization. Then, for the first
lime, the people of Arabia became united un
der one scepter and one creed, and powerful
enough to erect new empires in three quarters
of the worldâ in Palestine, Mesopotamia and
Persia, in Egypt aua the north of Africa and
in Spain.

A. P. Lorentzen and the Mate Said to
Have Had a Serious Alter
cation.
Two foreign ships docked at Union
street wharf yesterday. It is not the first
time, by many in the history of the port,
that two have docked at one and the same
time, but on this occasion both vessels in
question have had remarkably rough ex
periences rounding the Horn. From 50
to 50 they met with a succession of gales
that would have sent many a vessel to the
bottom. Both were splendidly handled
and reached port in safety. The Dominion
was the first to reach thedock, and Captain
Ike Smith, who was in command of the
tug Sea. Queen, made a splend id landing.
Captain Clem Randall, in the Vigilant,
bad hold of the Nederland, but both wind
and tide were against him. Nevertheless
he put the vessel into her berth in a man
ner that excited the envy of every tow
boat man on the water front. Tbe Domin
ion was the first to reach the wharf, and
it was not many minutes later before the
Nederiand was along the south side of
Union and discharging her cargo.
Both vessels-are engaged and will be ready
to load inside of three weeks.
In the case of ttae Dominion the eddy
set the sh,ip away from the wharf, but the
commander, Captain Meredith, at once got
stf am on the donkey engine and it did not
take long to warp the vessel into her
berth. , >
There is trouble on the otter-hunting
schooner Herman and in consequence A.
P. Lorentzen is in mourning. He could not
be found yesterday, but if all reDorts are
to be believed he is adorned witba beauti
ful pair of. black even and sundry acces
sories. Lorentzen is the man that has to
make both ends meet when an ofer or
sealer in which he is interested arrives in
port. When the Herman got in a splendid
showing was made and in consequence
the men began to celebrate. The hunters
were on 6alary, but the boat-ateerers, boat
puilers, steward and cabin boy were on
"a lay." First Mate Charley Rydell was
in tbe same predicament. When it came
to "paying off" Lorentzen on behalf of
tbe owners offered to pay at the rate of
$150 a skin. This was indignantly re
fused as it is said otter skins are now
worth from $500 to $900 each in London.
'. Â» It was over this difference in figures that
trouble arose. Rydell was to get a 35 per
cent "iay" on the price brought by the
skins.- Vvhtn he found the rate was fixed
at one-third their value he got angry.
Lorentzen visited the ship in order to put
her out of commission and then the trou
ble began.
The sailors have placed the matter in
tbe hands of Attorney riutton and he has
already begun proceedings in the matter.
Lorentzen has no sympathizers in the case,
as the entire crew can swear that many of
the skins are worth $900 each at the pres
ent time in the London market.
The tug Vigilant and the steam
schooner Westport went out to the Cordell
banks last Saturday night. The captain
of the towboat found the banks without
any trouble, but the caDtain of tbe steam
schooner failed. The result is easily told.
The fishermen on the Vigilant had fish to
sell and the fishermen on the Westport
bought them.
Next Bunday Captain Randall of the
Vigilant will take out a party of old-time
sports, and he promises that the best fish
ing grounds in the Pacific will be visited,
even if all and sundry are seasick.
Gunter Tron stead joined the Salva

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1896.
work and did not desire manual labor, so
he sought an easy time in the Lord's vine
yard. He pot it, but incidentally his land
lord is out and injured.
Many and many a time the case of the
injured sailor has been told, but this time
the boarding-master comes in. W. Mc-
Carthy, one of the most reputable in the
business, tells this story: 'On April 29 I
took Gunter Tronstead" off the British
ship Broderick Castle. 1 wanted men to
rill engagements, and 1 offered him in
ducements. He came asho-e and I ad
vanced him a few dollars. He got drunk
and broke his kneecap. On May o" I sent
him to the Marine Hospital, and on June
22 he came back. Ever since he has been
living on me, and yesterday when I offered
him a ship he said he had joined the Sal
vation Army.
'â¢The most I get out of this advance
would not have exceeded $35, so you can
easily see that there are two sides to every
story. Why, any coasting seaman can
live on me for a month and then demand
his baggase and I can't say him nay."
An unknown man fell or jumped from
tbe steamer Mary Garratt last Sunday
night. The vessel was on her way from
Stockton, but it took some time to stop it.
The Garratt was off Antioch and a boat
was lowered and one was also sent out
from the shore. Nevertheless no sign of
any body was found.
The following notice is issued by the
United Stales Lighthouse Inspectors:
Notice is hereby given that on September 28
the St. John post light will be moved to the
"Old Smith Dock," at. John, Or., about an
eighth of a mile in a westerly direction from
its present position. On ana after September
28 the present light will be discontinued and
initssieada fixed white light will be shown
from a lantern suspended from an arm on a
pile on the lower (west) side of the Smttli dock.
This notice affects the Lists of Light and Fog
Signals, Pacific Coast, 1896, page 'I\, No. 1085;

When the Egremont Castle arrived on
Sunday frorri Japan she sought an an
chorage in the bay off Goat Island. The
streckle-pin gave way and the vessel went
} adrift. Luckily another anchor held, and
the big tramp steamer is now safely at an
chor. Yesterday the tug Sea Witch was
out for twelve hour 3 seeking the lost mud
hook, but failed to findit.
DONNELLY'S DEBT GREW,
He Owed a Money-Lender $93,
but Was Foreclosed on
lor $500.
Thrifty Ways by Which Some Brokers
Make Their Coin Yield Immense
Returns.
Another instance of the facility with
which a note for a few dollars may evolve
into a judgment for several hundreds, par
ticularly when the note is drawn in favor
of a professional lender of coin, came to
light yesterday. E. Donnelly filed an affi
davit in the County Clerk's office in suu
port or an application for a restraining
order showing how J. J. Rauer had ob
tained judgment against him for $425 prin
cipal, $68 interest and the costs of the
suit, when Donnelly swears he owea Rauer
but $93 27.
About a year ago Donnelly borrowed
$179 from Rauer, giving his note therefor.
To secure the note he drew up a chattel
mortgage on thirteen horses, six sand
wagons, six sets of donble harness, one set
of single harness, two buggies, a lot of
tools and a blacksmith's outfit. He made
payments on his account from time to
time until the 1st of this month. Rauer
in the meantime, so Donnelly says, told
him to be easy in mind, as he (Rauer)
would take no steps in the matter without
notifying him. On September 1, however,
the money-lender entered a default against
Donnelly, and on September 11 got judg
ment for $493 and costs and foreclosed the
mortgage.
Donnelly says that through an excusa
ble mistake he neglected to answer the
suit, and further, that on September 1 he
owed Rauer but $141 27, he having al
ready paid him the difference between
that sum and $179, and that since then he
has paid another $48, leaving due but
$93 27.
Notwithstanding the fact that less than
$100 is due him Rauer preceedea under
his judgment for over $600, arid yesterday
would have sold Donnelly's horses and
wagons had it not been for the restraining
order, which was issued by the Superior
Court.

Tingman stated that Judge Hebbard
had paid the nomination fee, but would
not state his opinion of the financial ques

Cator said Hebbard's name had not been
before the committee properly. Gillespie
said Hebbard had been at the foot of the
stairs, but had not appeared before the
committee because he could not answer
the questions properly.
Judge Campbell's name was oast out be
cause he had signified his intention of
voting for McKinley.
A merry row was precipitated by Silvey of

as he was concerned. Silvey was declared
out of order.

The name of James D. Pnelan, proposed
by J. A. Johnson, met with such a storm
of hisses and catcalls that it was found
necessary for Johnson to rise and explain
his reasons for the nomination.
Edward Heintz, the delegate from the
Twenty-eighth, who made so tierce an at
tack on Mayor Sutro the other evening, as
soon as peace reigned, rose and said :
â¢'Gentlemen, this Phelan is not a true
Democrat. We don't want him for Mayor,
and tbe sentiment of the people is such
that he cannot be elected. I want to pro
pose tbe name of a man whose election
will give us a pure City government, a
name of which San Francisco should be
proudâ the name of Dr. C. C. O'Donnell."
The explosion of a bombshell could not
have created greater consternation. Fully
rive minutes were required to obtain quiet.
The convention then adjourned till 8

NON-PARTISAN
NOMINATIONS
Seven Candidates Were
Named at Last Nighf s
Session.
SOME WARM SPEECHES.
Resolutions Promising Those
Chosen Full Freedom
of Action.
BORDEN FOE SUPERIOR JUDGE.
Voting in Some Cases Runs Close and
Occasional Flashes of Tamper
Are Seen.
The Citizens' Non-Partisan Convention
resumed its work of formulating a ticket
last night. The lecture-hall of the Acad
emy of Sciences was packed. Nominations
were made for Superior Judge, Auditor,
Treasurer, Tax-Collector, City and County
Atttorney, Superintendent of Streets and
City and County Surveyor. The other
nominations, or at least a part of them,
will be made to-morrow evening.
Ex- Mayor Ellert presented a report
recommending the appointment by the
chair of a committee of five, whose duty
it should be to select nominees for the
Senate and Assembly.
This brought about much contention.
Frank J. Sullivan, who had introduced a
resolution at a former meeting to the effect
that a pledge be requested to be signed by
candidates without the necessity of nny
special committee, seemed somewhat
aggrieved at Mr. Ellen's proposed substi
tute. E. J. Le Breton claimed the discus
sion was out of order; Mr. EUert com
plained that he was being placed in a false
position before the convention, while C.
B. Perkins, A. S. Hallidie and others at
tempted explanations pro and contra.
Mr. Ellert's resolution was re-read, which
produced yet more wrangling, J. W.
Whiting and W. F. Wilson being the chief
speakers. At length Mr. Wilson moved
that Mr. Ellert's recommendation be
adopted, which was done.
It was also decided that the president
and vice-Dresident be ex-officio members
of all committees of the convention.
Mr. Le Breton introduced the following
resolutions, which were adopted unani
mously:
Resolved, By the Citizens' Non-Partisan con
vention, that its members individually and
collectively hereby pledge themselves not to
ask for any office for tnemselves nor for any
one in their behalf, nor for any official favor
from any candidate nominated by this con
vention because of any indorsement or sup
port accorded to him.
Resolved, That its members individually and
collectively promise to every faithful and
honest candidate elected to office the fullest
freedom of action in the management of his
department.
A communication from C. S. Tilton,
candidate for County Surveyor, was read,
in which Mr. Tilton stated he would be
willing to have a reduction of 5 percent
in his fees of office, that being all in his
opinion that the office could stand in view
of the present financial stringency.
The work of balloting for candidates
was next taken up, H. L. Davis and
George Cumming being appointed tellers.
Rhodes Borden and Frank H. Dunne were
proposed for nomination to the post of
Superior Judge. Fine speeches in favor of
each candidate were made by his friends
and the balloting resulted in 32 votes for
Mr. Borden ana 16 for Mr. Dunne. Mr.
Borden's nominatian was made unani
mous.
Asa R. Wells was next proposed for
Auditor by Mr. Whiting, while Mr. Ellert
made a glowing eulogy of Mr. Broderick,
tbe incumbent. Mr. Le Breton and
others spoke in the same strain. The
balloting resulted in favor of Mr. Broder
ick, the vote standing 38 to 9.
Nominations for Treasurer were called
for and Mr. Le Breton proposed A. C. Wid
ber, the present incumbent, who was nom
inated by acclamation. The same proced
ure was followed in the case of James M.
Block for Tax Collector and Harry T.
Creswell for City and County Attorney.
George P. Wetmore was proposed by
Mr. Le Breton for Superintendent of
Streets, Lester Jacobs named D. L. Farns
worth for the same position, and I. J. Tru
man paid a glowing tribute to George W.
Elder. A heated discussion ensued, and
it was moved that the matter be referred
back to the nominating committee. The
motion was lost, the vote standing 23 to
25. The candidates were then voted for,
the nomination jroine to Mr. Wetmore,
the vote standing 32 to 16 for Farnsworth
giving him exactly the two-thirds re
quired. Tne nomination was made unani
mous.
The nomination for City and County
Surveyor was next called for. The names
of Charles S. Tilton and Lot D. Norton
were suggested. Charles Ashton and Mr.
Ellert opposed Mr. Tilton's nomination on
the ground that his connection with the
famous Dashaway case had never been
satisfactorily explained. A. 8. Hallidie
proposed Robert Munch and speeches ga
lore were delivered. The balloting re
sulted in a victory for Mr. Norton, the
vote standing: Norton 40, Tilton 6
Munch 2.
The chair appointed L. R. Ellert, Theo
dore Payne, Jeremiah Lynch, Julius Kahn

Railroad Suit* Dismissed.
The eight suits against the Southern Pacific
instituted in the United States Circuit Court
last February, to recover lands valued at half
a million dollars, were formally dismissed by
District Attorney Foote yesterday. The
authorities at Washington 'investigated the
cases, finally reaching the conclusion that it
tvould be better not to press them at the pres
ent. Mr. Foote wns authorized to dismiss the
suits, provided the railroad would pay the
costs, amounting to $410. This has been
done, hence the action of the District Attorney
referred to.

ejectment suits of Craven against Fair
â¢ and Craven against Oeirichs.
The depositions took place before Notary
â¢ Phillips in the Crocker building, the first
consuming all the morning and a part of
the afternoon. Miss Virginia Fair was to
have followed Mrs. Oeirichs in the first
suit, but she being reported by her coun
sel as indisposed, Mrs. Oelrichs followed
.â¢ herself in the second suit over the same

first.
indeed, almost all the testimony was

There was. however, a flatter of interest
awakened when the witness in answer to
a question as to her reason for her lack of
faith in, the marriage contract brought
â¢ forward by Mrs. Craven declared that the
last words her father ever spoke to her
were: "I will never marry again." That
was in November, 1895.

tract with Mr. Dey had you heard' of the
marriage contract said to exist between
your father and Mrs. Craven*" aslftd Mr.
Brittarin.
"I do not remember."
"Did you ever see the alleged contract?"
"No, I did not." . " â¢
'pif-you ever see a photographic copy
'â¢No."
"If such a document is in existence,
Â» Tiave you any belief as to its genuineness?"
. "I would not believe if to be genuine."
". **P rf what do you base your disbelief ?"
â¢1 do not believe my father was married.
He has told me that he was not married."
"Did, your father at any time within
three or four years of his death speak as
t to tbe possibility of hi 3 ever man-vine?"
"He never spoke of the possibility of it.
He often said he never would on our ac
count â on account of his children He
said that the very last time I saw himâ
the day I went East, in November, 1894,
and when I was ou my way to the bsat.
He said that he might have married and
been very happy, but that he did not be
cause he wanted everything he had to go 1
to us. The very last words he said to me
were, 'I am not married.'"
"Can you identify any other occasion
on which he said that he would never
marry ?" ;
"I cannot specify any occasion, but he
said so on every occasion that 1 saw him."
"How often was that?"
"Very often during a period of ten
years."
''Did your father ever write to you mak
ing the statement that he would never
marry on account of you, your sister aud
brother?' '
"Very often."
"Have you retained those letters?"
: "No ; I "have destroyed them all. "
"He frequently wrote such letters?"
"Yes, it seemed to be a hobby with him ;
if seemed to be always on his mind."
"Where did this conversation take place
between your father and yourself that you
speak of ? "
"At the Lick House."
â¢â¢Will you be good enough to detail ail
of the conversation that passed between
you of that time?"
"The conversation, except for that state
ment, was upon private matters that 1 J
will not repeat here."
"Were you upon friendly terms with
your father at that time and until the
time of his death?"
"Yes."
"You said you destroyed all the letters
from your father, did you not?"
. "I said I destroyed the letters you spoke
ofâ not all tne letters from my father."
"Did you receive a letter from your
lather about November, 1894, in which be
said ne would not live long, and that it
would be better for all parties if be would
so die?"
"No, sir; I did not. I never received
such a letter."
"Did not Rubsell J. Wilsou say to you
on or about the day that you withdrew
your petition for the probate of tbe will of
the 24th of September that it was his be
lief that, it was the g-enuine will and that
it would be probated by Mr. Delmas on
behalf of Marc Levin srston?''
Objected to as au effort to draw out pri
vate conversations of the witness with
counsel.
The witness was asked if she had been
visited by a newspaper man during the
past day or so concerning the whereabouts
of J. H. Cassanova. She said she had not
âshe did not know Mr. Cassanova.
"Do you know the value, of the property
at Eleventh and Mission streets, in con
test in this action?"
"No, I do not.".
"Do you know what rents accrue from
it?"
"No, i dojiot."
This ended the deposition or Craven
against Fair.
Mrs. Oelrichs was then sworn for the
taking of her deposition in the twin suit
of Craven against Oelrichsâ the suit in
ejectment for the recovery by Mrs Craven
of the property at Pine and Sansome
streets.
Mr. Wheeler suggested that tbe deposi
tion taken in the other case serve by stip
ulation, so far as it went at least, in this
case. But Mr. Brittain said that without
wishing to inconvenience the witness in
any way he preferred to go on in the regu
lar way without regard to any other case.
Accordingly careful inquiries were made
as to her name, her residence, her relation
ship to the late Senator Fair, her travels
in Europe, her stay at Newport and as to
her visit Here, as in the other case.
She was asked as to the Richard V. Dey
$500,000 contract and the alleged deeds in
favor of Mrs. Craven. Bhe said she had
seen photographs of the alleged deed of
the Sansome-Btreet property. She declared
she thought the deed a forgery; that all
her counsel had advised her it was and
tbat.it.did not look like her father's hand
writing.
She was asked attain as to the letters
that passed between herself and her
father, and if the frequent letters which
she said they wrote were affectionate as
between father and daughter.
"Neither of uÂ« were ever very demon
strative â we did not stop to put our affec
tion in our letters," she said.
"Did you stop to put anything in your
letters of a contrary tone?"
"We did not."
','He was always a kind and affectionate
father to you?"
"Yes, sir."
The deposition here closed. That of
Miss Virginia Fair will be begun this
morning.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1896.
WANT TO OPEN
MORTON STREET
Property- Owners on That
By-Place Have a New
Scheme.
PETITION SUPERVISORS.
The Dens Are to Be Reoccu
pied Under the Guise of
Lodging-Houses.
SEEMLY COHDTJCT PROMISED.
Folsom Street to Be Paved From
Third to the Water
Front.
Under the pretense that tbe long-closed
dens on Morton street are to be used as
lodging-houses, an effort is on foot to
open tbe street again, and as a prelim
inary the Board of Supervisors has been
asked to discontinue the police surveil
lance that has resulted in making tbe
former habitues of the dens seek other
quarters.
Though the petitionersâ the property
owners â promise everything in the way of
order and decency, the fact that they de
sire the police called off first is signifi
cant. Tbe petition is as follows:
This petition of the undersigned, owners of
the property fronting 011 Morton street, be
tween Grant avenue and Stockton street, in
the City and County of San Francisco, respect
fully shows and represents:
That by reason of tbe police sn.rveillan.ee
now beiug exercised over said portion of Mor
ton street our property has become vacant and
useless, and in some cases we have Dccii
obliged to cancel insurance thereon, the com
panies being unwilling to carry it.
We desire to be able to use and have the
property used as lodging houses and furnished
rooms, and ii the police surveillance be with
drawn we shall be able to so let the property,
and we pledge ourselves jointly and severally
that if permitted so to use the property as
above suggested, it shall be useu in a quie
and seemly manner; there shall be no soiicitt.
ing from the windows nor improper nor in
decent behavior therein; neither will we al
low or permit any behavior which shall be
off ensive in any manner to the public use of
said portion of said street as a thoroughfare.
The names of a large number ol busi
ness men whose places are near tbe street
are .-igned to the petition in addition to
the property-owners.
The Soutb Side and Folsom-street Im
provement clubs petitioned the board to
have the gas lamps on Folsom street from
Third to Nineteenth replaced by sixteen
electric lights, one at each crossing. It
was represented that Folsom street is
already lighted with electricity from Nine
teenth to Thirty-sixth, and that the City
will save $125 per month by the change.
! The matter was referred to the Street
; Lichts Committee.
John Atkinson of St. Louis addressed a
communication to the board statine that
he had intended to remove to California
with iiis family, but hears that female
suffrage is to be voted for at the next elec
tion, and has decided to wait and see
whether or not it will pass. He claims
that Kansas has been mined by female
suffrage.
The Superintendent of Streets was in
structed to recommend the paving with
bitumen of Folsom street from Third to
the water front.

"WOMAN SUFFRAGE DAY"
Miss Anna H. Shaw Will Make
an Address at the Me
chanics' Fair.
Kind Words for v The Call" From
the Sole Surviving Sister of
Henry Ward Beecher.
Thursday of this week will be "Woman
Suffrage Day" at the Mechanics' Fair.
In the evening at 8:30 o'olock Miss Anna
H. Shaw will lecture in the art gallery and
tell her hearers "How to Make California
Rich." A large number of prominent so
ciety people have signified their intention
of being present.
Miss Susan B. Anthony has just returned
from a week of hard work in tbe interior.
"They say woman's 'physical disability'
should be a bar to her having the ballot,"
said the veteran suffragist, "but I would
like to see the man of my years who could
pass the week I have just passed and still
be ready and anxious for more work. But
it has been a glorious week, none the less,
and well worth the fatigue of incessant
travel, public speaking and broken rest.
"In ViÃalia and Hanford our rallies
were simply stupendous, with bonfires,
rockets and other things that men like.
As for the crowds, it was said that those
which gathered to listen to Mr. Khortridge
were no larger."
Mrs. Austin Sperrv has received a letter
from Mrs. Isabella "Beecher Hooker, sole
surviving sister of Henry Ward Betcher
and Harriet Beecher Stowe. The lady,
though upward of 76 years old, is an
ardent and vigorous woman-suffrage
worker. In her letter she says:
We have our annual State Suffrage Conven
tion early in October, ana copies of your "Ob
jections Answered" would help us, especially if
inclosed in envelopes with flag and stars
showing tho three States already crowned
Many a man in this city of Hartford, Conn.,
and of course many a woman, does not know
that the experiment of women voting fias
been tried for many years in Wyoming; and
The Courantâ Charles Dudley Warner's paper
and Senator Joseph Hanley'sâ doesn't mean
its subscribers shall know it if by any means
they can still be kept in Ignorance.
Oh, for such a Call as yon have, and such an
editor I Plensesend me a few items that pos
sibly may get into our newspapers, thougn
they care little for such news.
Reports of City and State workers are
daily becoming more interesting and en
couraging.
To Rf join Her Parents.
Lillian Swaun, the young colored girl who
was stolen from her parents in Washington,
D. C, thirteen years ago, is now on her way
home. Chief Crowley procured free transpor
tation for her to Chicago and defrayed the cost
of taking her from there to Washington out of
his own pocket Detective Anthony accom
panied her to the Oakland mole yesterday, and
saw her safely started on her journey.

The review of troops at the Presidio
yeaterday afternoon in honor of Major-
General Miles was a rive display. It had
color, -life -and dabh. Two horses of a
caisson went. down when the light bat
teries were going across the field at full
gallop. The rider sayed himself by a
quick jump. The accident, or mishap,
caused a flutter *of subdued shrieks from
the ladies, who dimly saw the steeds go
down in a cloud of dust.
The lively airs of the Fifth Artillery and
First Infantry bands, the fast riding of
aids and orderfies, the superb marching
of the infantry and foot artillery, the
swift evolutions of the light artillery and
the picturesque effect of officers of high
rank in full uniform all lent their aid to
make the scene picturesque and ani
mated.
Early in the 4 y a Lr.ttaiion oi the First
Infantry, utiQt-i command of Captain
John J. O'Connell, came over on the
bteamer from Anyel Island to join the
coJumn for review. The two battalions
stationed at Alcatraz were also brought to
tne peninsula, and the battery at Fort
Mason was in iine along with, the troops
quartered at the Presidio.
The Fifth Artillery was formed in three
battalions. The first battalion, com
manded by Major John A. Darling, con
sisted of Batteries A, I, C and L. The
second battalion, commanded by Captain
Benjamin K. Roberts, was composed of
Batteries M. E and B. The light artillery
battalionâ Battery D, Captain Thorp, and
Battery X, Cantaiu Reilly â was com
manded by Major Tuliy McCrea. The en
tire column was under command of Gen
eral Graham.
The review was announced for 2 o'clock,
but the major-yenera! did not reach the
field urltil iiuy-rive minutes later. Mean
while the ladies were expressing sympathy
for the soldiers who had to stand in line,
and no doubt the men in the ranks enter
tained reciprocal sympathy for the spec
tators.
General Miles lost but little time in
alighting from his carriage and mounting
aaorse. He presented aline figure on horse
back. The spectators exclaimed, "Whut
a tine-rooking man.' When the general
came to the reviewing stand the light ar
tillery saJute of fifteen guns was fired, the
number prescribed by tne army regula
tions for a major-general commanding the
army. The major-general, with less than
au army to command, gets the proverbial
uniucicy n urn her of thirteen. After the
salute General Miles, accompanied by Col
onel Shafter, commanding the depart
ment, and followed by Major Edward
Field, Major Hoff, surgeon; Major Stephen
W. Groesbeck, judge-advocat* ; Captain
Miohler and First Lieutenant Frank
Oreene. signal corps, made the tour of the
field. CoJonel O. D. Greene, adjutant
;,'e:ieral, and Colonel A. S. Kimball, chief
quartermaster of the department, attended
tue-revjew as spectators.
After tne column had passefi in review
General Graham, commanding the post,
suggested that the light batteries should
do a turn in the field. Evidently General
Miies was gratified at the suggestion.
Once the batieried wen: around on a trot
and then at a full galop. When going at
a runmne pace a horse attached to one of
the rear caissens of Battery F failed to

keep up and fell in the strussle. Had the
failing steed been well up in front there
would have been a pretty mess. There
was spine enough in the dash of the .light
artillerymen to recall incidents of real
action.
In another turn around the field a ser
peant was dismounted and slightly hurt.
His horse ran away and did not stop run
ning until he goi outside of the reserva
tion. Later in the day a little girl was
knocked over but escaped unhurt.
Gsneral Miles was highly pleased with
the review, and particularly delighted
with the evolution" of the light artillery.
He will inspect the dynamite guns, tne
mortar batteries and thetwelve-incb rifles
this afternoon. It was on the programme
to look at the pneumatic plant yesterday,
but there wa3 nOt sufficient time after the
review.

ROYCE IS ACQUITTED
Declared Nor Guilty of Embezrling
Fundi of the Veterans' Home
Association.
A jury in Judge Trout t's court yesterday
declared C. E. X, Koyce not guilty of em
bezzling $'_>050 from the Veterans' Home
Association.
This verdict practically er.ds a once
famous case. Koyce is the ex-secretary of
the Veterans' Home Association who a
coup'.e of years ago was found in a
lodging-house wounded nigh uuto death,
but in inch a mystenotiH manner that tor
a long time the nature of his injuries
could not be d termined. It was finally
discovered that he had shot himself in the
top of his iiraa.
During his convalescence a shortage of
almost $20,000 was discovered ia his ac
counts wita the association. He has
been twice tried on the c arts of embezzle
ment, being found guilty the first time,
but, i aving been granted a new trial by
tbe Supreme Court, be is now acquitted.
The other charges ag.iinst him will prob
ably be dismissed, and the only recourse
the association now has is in the civil
courts.
Another Suit Against Kelly.
Harry Shepard, w ho was one of tbe roomers

ana several other corporations at about
their real value.
General J. H. Dickinson and J. C. Camp
bell represented the accused City fathers,
while District Attorney Barnes and his
assistant, Mr. Hosmer, looked after the in
terests of the prosecution.
The morning was consumed in examin
ing talesmen as to their qualifications to
serve as jurors in the case. Almo?t the
entire venire wasexhausted when the time
arrived for the noon recess, and, as the ac
cused Supervisors were obliged to attend a
meetine of the board during the afternoon,
further proceedings were postponed until
this morning.
Mr. Barnes had few questions to put to
the talesmen examined. He asked if the
prospective juror was a personal friend or
acquaintance of any or all of the accused
and if he was interested in or influenced
by any large corporation. Mr. Campbell,
for the defense, was more particular. He
had to be assured that the talesman was
not opposed to the existence of large cor
porations simply because they are large;
that he was not prejudiced against the ac
cused by newspaper accounts or other
wise; that he would not be influenced by
the fact that the Grand Jury bad indicted
the Supervisors, and many other thats.
He also wanted to know if the man being
examined owned any slock of any corpo
ration, if he knew bupervisor Taylor and
if he belonged to any civic federation.
Eight men successfully answered the
queries propounded and were accepted as
jurors, subject, however, to peremptory
challenges by Attorney CamDbell when
court opens this morning. Following are
the names and residences of those selected:
Chris Knoburan, 2031 Fillmore.
Â£. A.kus, 1126 Buchanan.
H. Levy, 922 Eidy.
Max Armer, 306 Sacramento.
Charles Wiener, 390 Sixth.

LYNCH'S NEW PAPER.
After a Long KeÂ§t the Veteran Editor
Will Start a Handqnme Weekly-
Journal of Opinion.
J. 0. Lynch, for many years editor and
proprietor of the Los Angeles Herald, is
at the Lick, and has completed arrange
ments tor starting a new weekly journal
in Los Angeles. He has had this in view
for a long time, in fact ever since He re
linquished his interest in the Herald. He
has now had two years' rest, and fs going
to get back in the traces. The first num
ber is to be issued the next day after the
election, as the editor purposely desires to
avoid the campaign and the dull business
of summer.
"It will bo a sixteen-page paper with
four columns to the page, and be largely
a journal of opinion," said Mr. Lynch.
"It will have halt- tone pictures and
special features in colors, as occasion may
demand. I may say it will be up to the
extreme of the realistic. In politics it will
be independent. After being twenty
seven years under tbe glare of the gas
light in the editorial-rooms of morning
papers I could not well keep out of the
profession forever, and so after two years,
during which I have attended to some
private business, and taken as much of a
rest as I want, I am going to return to it."

of the prices during the greater part of the day
was d ward. Profit taking was mainly re-
sponslble for the reaction, and an advance in Hie
" posted and aciual rates of sterling exchange, the
poor statement for Augus; made by some of the
leading roads and a reduction male in .he pri Â« s of
. refined sugar were also contributing factors. The
advance fa sterling exchange and t->e higher rates
for discounts in London created an impression
that the movement of gold was over, temporarily
at least* and in the absence of details little
credence was placed in the London rumor of a
â probCble shipment ot $5,000.000 g0id to -New Yoric

duced some selling for the si: on account, and close

AN ENORMOUS PIE.
ASix-by-Ten Monster With Which York-
shire Celebrated a Famous I-. vent.
Under different akies jubilees an ' cele
brations partake of varying characteristics.
In Yorkshire, and in some other parts of
England also, every occasion for rejoicing
is marked by t c baking of a huge pie,
which, after being exnibited, is devoured
by all the inhabitants, says the New York
Journal.
At Denby Dale, a Yorkshire hamlet, for
instance, the other day the people cele
brated the fiftieth anniversary of the re
peal of the corn Jaws by constructing an
enormous pie 6 feet 6 inches wide and 10
feet 6 inches tons. The dimensions ot the
indigestion which followed are not given.
This is not so large as the pie that this
same village built on another anniversary
some years ago, which was drawn through
the place witn thirty-two horses, headed
by three braes bands, and was afterward
put away under the waistcoats of tbe
Denby Dalers. It is said that some of the
older inhabitants still retain portions of it
in their osseous formation.
Underground London has some 3000
m les of s wers, 34,000 miles of telegraph
wires, 3200 miles of gaspipes and 4500
miles of water-mains.

AN ECHO OF A
HASTY MARRIAGE
John H. O'Brien Left Noth
ing but Jewelry to
Mrs. Evans.
HIS ONLY DAUGHTER.
She Refused to Remain Single
Until She Was 19 Years
â¢ â¢ of Age.
MARRIED WITHOUT CONSENT.
Tbe Respected Late Liquor Merchant
Was â Thoroughly Reconciled BÂ»
-fore His D?ath.
Oaklakd Office San Francisco Call.)
â . 908 Broadway, Sept. 28. \
When the will of the iate John H.
O'Brien was' filed recently, one clause at
tracted general attention. It referred to his
1 s
MRS. E. W. EVANS, the Only Child of the Late John H. O'Brien,
â¢ .['. Who Married Against Her Parents' Will, and "Whose Share
â¢';..,, oÂ° of Her 0 Father's Estate Is Dependent Entirely Upon â¢ Her
. : -\"'i Mother's . â¢ ";'./.
only daughter Mvrah, and read : "I pur
posely omit leaving her apy property. 1
know ber mother wiil provide for her."
The secret of this little clause dates
rjack; to the earjy spring of this year,
v.hen without her parents' consent Miss
Mjrxmhj then just a little older than 18,
secretly married. Little was said about
the affair at" the time, and even now the
fact that th.c attractive and only daughter
of the, late popular merchant is Mrs. Â£.
W. Evans it not very generally known.
Mr. O'Brien died rather suddenly about
two weeks ago and left a fine estate valued
at about $100,000.
The quiet wedding at Los Angeles last
spring had, a touch of romance about it.
}liss CTBrieh and E. W. Evans had ieen
acquainted for over a year. Evans was a
bookkeeper' in Oakland, and although the
friendship between tho young couple was
known to the parents the latter would not
give their consent till their dauehter was a
year older. Affairs were in this state when
t o he" O'Brien family went to Loa Aneeles
fast February. Evans accompanied them
and was desirous of making his permanent
home In the southern city. Altnough an
engagement existed between the young
folks it bad not reached a point where the
scruples of the parents could be overcome.
One ot the chief â¢objections to the marriage
was, it is stated by friends, a difference of
religious belief.
while' ln Los Angeles the lovers decided
that the. time was propitious and they de
cided to await no longer the consent of the
family. They notified the O'Briens of
their determination and the parents re
turned to Oakland without them. They
were duly wedded on February 19 by a
Methodist clergyman ana made their
home in Los Angeles. Her parents felt
very keenly the slighting of their wishes
and Mr. O'Brien said at the time that he
would have consented to their wedding
bad they agreed t,o wait a year longer.
When Mr. O'Brien died interest was
centered on the provision that be bad
made for his daughter. Now that the will
has been filed it is seen that tbe late mer
chant left' his daughter's welfare in the
bands of hit widow.
An intimate friend of the family said
to-day that long before his death tne old
merchant was completely reconciled to
his daughter. However, he only left her
his jewelry, with a remark that be pur
posely omitted making any distribution
of his estate in ber favor.
The Holes fn the Canal Bridge.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 28.â The condi
tion of the tidal canal bridge was brought
up before the Supervisors to-day, and tne

Whereas, The attention of this board has

tered by the Third District Court of the United
States in the case entitled "The United States
vb. M. Crooks et. al. No. 3690," and filed Sep
tember SO, 1882; now therefore be it
Hetolvd, By the Board of Supervisors of the
ounty of Alameda, that the clerk of this
board be Rnd he is hereby instructed to notify
the War-Department of the United States of

THE BORAX KING'S PLANS.
He Has Floated ft Big Syndicate and
Will Revive His Ferry Project
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 28.â Frank M.
ifJmith of East Oakland, whose name is in
separably connected with borax, returned
home this evening with his family, and
will spend the winter in his new palatial
house on Fourth avenue.
While in Europe Mr. Smith has floated
a borax syndicate at Liverpool. He re
tains the controlling interest. Mr. -Smith
is also the head and controlling party in
several street-railroad systems in this city,
and several changes in their management
will shortly be made. It is reported' that
they will all be placed under one general
management and that there will be a new
system of details introduced. The local
realty syndicate of which Mi. Smitn is in
control, and which has been bonding hun
dreds of acres of land in the vicinity of
Emeryville, where Mr. Smith recently
built a very substantial pier a mile long,
will at once take in the railroad systems,
and when the result of the elections is
made known the project for lunningferry
boats from Emeryville to Market street,
San Francisco, will be taken up. This has
been a favorite idea with Mr. Smith for
three years, but was set aside when the
money market became so unsettled about
a year ago.
Mr. Smith was met at the depot by some
of the directors of the syndicate and drove
at once to nis bomc. He would only say
that he had several new plans in view and
that he could not tell anything about
them till be had time to look into the
E resent condition of the properties under
is control.

building at Fourteenth and San Pablo,

and $10,000 in cash, and Geoige C. Pardee

AMBROSEWF HAS GONE
The Self-Styled Exiled Count
Says He Will Return
With a Fortune.
Many Now Eelieve That the Russian
Consu/s Estimate Was Very
Near the Truth.
Oakland Office Â£ak Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept 28. [
Dr. Ambrosewf, the "physician" of this
I city, who has claimed to be a Russian
1 exile and various otber interesting per
sonages, has gone on a journey and there
j are many people trying to guess the rea
| son for It. a few months ago Ambrosewf
! gave an interview for publication that the
j Russian Consul at Ban Francisco de
- nounced as false. The official stated at
the time that the "doctor" was not act
ing in good â¢faith.
Ambrosewf was always speaking of the
fortune that was coming to him from
Russia. He recently received some docu
ments, liberally plastered with seals,
which he said conveyed to him the good
tidings that henceforth be was to receive
f 23,000 every quarter.
One night about two years ago he went
to the police station with a story that he
had been followed in the dark, when he
was attacked by a big fellow, but that he
fought him off and as he disappeared fired
'a shot at the fleeing form, but failed to hit
the mark.
Ambrosewf has gone away, and before
be left he told his landlady the following
story regarding his affairs:
"I have received notice that $23,000, the
first quarterly installment of my future's
annual income, has been sent to Portland,
Or., in care of the Russian Consul. I am
coin* there to eet it and when I return I
shall pay my bills and once more be able
to hold my head erect, I had the money
sent to Portland as I did not want the
Consul in San Francisco to get the com
mission those officials are entitled to, but
would rather a suanger should have it."
He also told his landlady that as his
wife was an extravagant woman he had
not told her of the money arriving, but
told ber it was necessary for him to go
away on business and when he returned
she would no longer have to slave her life
away or go in need of the necessities of
life. .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1896.
OAKLAND CORPS
BEGIN THE WORK
Sergeant Brown of the
Salvation Army at
San Quentin.
VOLUNTEERS ARE THERE
The Big Bastile an Object
Great Interest to Both
Organizations.
ONLY TWO HAVE SECEDED.
N?xt Sunday There Will Probably
Be Rival Soul-Winners at
the State Prison.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 28. )
The Oakland corps of the Salvation
Army, which is tbe oldest and largest on the
coast, is making a special effort to hold an
enthusiastic meeting at San Quentin prison
next Sunday. At this time Warden Hale's
bastile is a point of the greatest interest
to both the Salvation Army and the Vol
unteers, of which Mrs. Booth is at the
head. Next Sunday it is given out that
Sergeant-Major Brown of the Oakland
corps will co to San Quentin as usual and
that Mrs. Booth will also hold a meeting
there. If both carry out their programme
they will probably agree on different
hours.
Sergeant-Major Brown, in conjunction
with Adjutant Ei*ner, who was then sta
tioned in Oakland, inaugurated the work
among the prisoners of Ban Quentin, and
he has never failed to visit every second
Sunday since August, 1893, when tbe work
opened. At the present time there are
twenty-five men in the Salvation Army
corps at San Quentin, and if tbe Volun
teers follow up the lead of Mrs. Booth,
there may soon be a Volunteer corps there
as well.
An impression has gained ground that
Mrs. Booth, while a Salvationist, started
the work at San Qnentin. Sergeant-Major
Brown, who is still in charge of the work",
desires the following statement to be made
public:
Editor of The Call, San Francisco, Col.â Sib:
Will you kindly give me space to contradict
an erroneous report which has just gone the
rounds of tbe press?
The statement to which I refer. In alluding
to Mrs. Maud Booth's protracted visit to the
coast, says: "It is her intention to begin her
work In California in San Quentin prison. Kho
visited that institution a year ago, while still
connected with the SalvÃtlou Army, and estab
lished a large post among the prisoners. Since
the rupture In the army the members ol the
prison post have voted to remain faithful to
Mrs. Booth and to unite with the Volunteers."
Tnere is not a word of truth in the above.
Adjutant Egner and I held the first balvation
Army meeting ever conducted in San Quentlu,
over three years ago, and tbe only thing Mrs.
Booth ever did toward "establishing a large
post among the prisoners" was to speak to
them a few minutes during her recent visit to
California. A corps had been formed among
the prisoners long before Mrs. Booth's visit.
The statement that the members of the
prison post have voted to remain faithful to
Sirs. Booth and to unite with the Volunteers
is equally misleading. When the "rupture"
occurred we had about twenty-five converts in
the prison, and of that number only two
evinced eny desire to join the new movement.
The others remained true to the Salvation
Army and are very earnest in their declara
tions of loyalty to the organization which has
labored so long an t so earnestly in their in
terests.
I am in a position to speak with authority on
this subject as I hola meetings in the prison
every alternate Bandar.
I would like to say that the prison work is
thoroughly organized in tne City. When a
prisoner is discharged the doors of the Balva-

ment will be found for him, and If work can't
be obtained for him at once he will be kept
free of all charge at one of our homes till
something turns up. In some instances we
have kept ex-convicts for several weeks.
Some months ego Mrs. Maud Booth visited
California and the text of all her addresses
during her sojourn was: "Stick to the army:
there's nothing like it." The Salvationist
took her advice and 99 per cent of them are
determined to keep it. Respectfully yours,

Oakland, Sept. 27. 1896.
When Sergeant-Major Brown was at San
Quentin a week from yesterday some of the
converts were anxious to sign forms known
as artloles of war. The sergeant only had
those with Baliington Booth's name on
them. The recruits declined to sign them
until the name was erased, "I was told to
be careful," said Brown to-night, "as some
of them staled that if they had altered
names they would not be there."

was Jic!:i on the re mi ;i ins of Sirs. Stacy,
who died suddenly Saturday night, and

Dr. Akerly did later her life might have
been saved. The deceased fell on the
street, and died in Dr. Akerly' s carriace
from heart failure.
Mrs. Stacy was a sister of Mrs. J. F. Sut- |

George William and Fred Stacy. She was
born in England and was 62 years of age.

ALAMEDA, Cal.. Sept. 28.â A week ago
last Bunday morning George Hegewald,
a baker, drove his wagon over the fire
hose at a fire. On Monday he pleaded
guilty when taken before Recorder Bt
Sure, but did not have the money to pay a
$5 fine. He was given until Saturday to
pay, but he failed to put in an appearance.
The Recorder asked the police to notify
Hegewald to settle. To-day he called at
the station to ask what was wanted, and
was placed under arrest. He stoutly
maintains that he never pleaded guilty,
and supposed tbe charge bad been dis
missed. He secured bail and retained an

A Suspicion Current That

Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 28. j
West Oakland is gossiping to-night over
i what is supposed to be a double elope
ment. Miss Rollins and Miss Clifford,
wno live in the neichborhood of Fifth
and Chester streets, have suddenly left
, their- homes and it is reported
j that they have cone with a
couple of young gentlemen from Ban
Francisco, whose names are not known to
their parents. Their leaving home was
reported to the police to-night and a de-
I tailed description of the girls was sent to
! Ban Francisco, where it is believed they
have gone.
The young ladles are about 17 years of
age and so far have enjoyed the very best
reputation, and neither has ever given
any indication of a disposition to be
fiddy. A week ago two men from San
rancisco made the acquaintance of the
girls, and they have been in the vicinity
of the young ladies' homes on two oc
casions since.
The girls are both of medium height,
fair, and tolerably attractive. Their
parents are Bparing no effort to find them,
and will place serious charges against
their companions.
Train Gates bat No Fares.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Sept 29.â 0n Thurs
day next the cars of the broad-gauge train
will all have gates. They fold up instead
of sliding upon bars, and are a pretty pat
tern.
No fares are to be charged for local rid
ing. The company does not charge for
local riding in Oakland, but all who ride
must have a ticket before entering the
car, and those who have maintained all the
time that there would be no fares to pay
will find that they are right, but before en
tering the car they will find it convenient
to show a ticket for some place on the
line. The conductors admit that the gates
are to be put in use this week.

OAKLAND, Cal.. Sept. 28.â A tire broke

PEOPLE'S BUNK
EMBRDGLIO ENDED
Judge Seawell Granted the
Defendant's Motion
for Non-Suit.
OFFICIALS JUSTIFIED.
His Honor Criticizes Sheehan
for Drawing Money
Without Order.
NEW BANK LAW SUGGESTED.
Directors Urged to Proceed at Once
to the Collection of Un
paid Cap.tal.
Judge Seawell yesterday granted a nou
â¢uit in the case of the people against the
secretary and directors of the defunct
People's Home Savings Bank. His Honor
covers the case fully in his decision, in
which he says in part:
In this suit, which was brought against John
F. Sheehan. secretary and manager of the
bank, and George Stone, S. K. Thornton, E. N.
Freeman, William H. Phelps and William P.
Taylor, directors, it is claimed that the de
fendants were guilty of criminal carelessness
and negligence In administration of the bank's
affairs, and that they are not proper persons to
be intrusted with the closing of the business
of the bank in the interest of depositors,
creditors ami stockholders.
On May 9, 1895. the bank was declared in
â olvent and on April 11, 1896, the present ac
tion was brought. Ko attempt has been made
to impeach the defendants for honesty or in
tegrity, bin only unfltness on the part of the
accused officials is alleged.
In regard to General Sheehan, this is not a
proceeding to punith him for refusing to per
mic a creditor or stockholder to inspect the
books or for having made a transfer ot stock
on the books of the bank without the approval
of the board of directors. Neither is it an ac
tion against him for an accounting or to recover
moneys improperly expended by him. The
questions lo answer are: Has Sheehan been
guilty of criminal negligence? Is he a proper
person lo U.- intrusted with the duties of secre
tary and manager? He refused three times to
allow the books to be inspected, and I find no
excuse is offered that seems to justify this re
fusal. However, this is not of sufficient
gravity to merit serious consideration iv the
case. As far as the transfer of stock upon the
books of the bank is concerned, there is no
allegation made that auy stock was trans*
ferred to any person outside the State.
While the action of General Sheehan In
making these transfers without the approval
of the board is not approved I do not think it
supports the charge that he is not a fit person
to occupy the position of secretary and man
ager. Neither this nor the preceding charge
reflects upon his personal integrity. As to
General Sheehan's acts in making certain dis
bursements ior which he is alleged not to have
taken proper vouchers he was then acting us
repelver, and I emphatically disapprove of the
manner in which he, without any order of
court, appropriated money ot the bank as com
pensation-for his services as such ; but in re
gard to the other claims paid, while a few
vouchers may have been imperfect, there is no
question but that General Sheehan paid out
everj dollar for which he claims crelit, and 1
fail to see how the interests of the depositors
will be advanced by removing him at this
time.
The charges that the directors mentioned In
> the complaint were guilty of unreasonable de
lay in calling in the unpaid capital due by
the stockholders; that they permitted Gen
eral Sheehan to make extravagant expendi
tures antl that they conspired to remove At
torney Flournoy are not supported by the
evidence.
One of the most pressing duties qt the board
.and Its attorneys at present is to collect the
unpaid capital. That duty is not discharged
by simply passing a resolution and giving a
list of the stockholders to the attorney, oreven
by the commencement of suits. It is the duty
of all the directors to see that the suits are
prosecu.ted with diligence.
It ii an unfortunate condition of the law
which compels the depositors of this bank to
await the pleasure of the stockholders and
their representatives, ihe directors, in col
lecting me uirpaid capital. I would recom
mend that the law in this respect be amended
by the Legislature so that the unpaid capital
Of insolvent banking institutions may be
called in and collected by an officer appointed
by the court or the Bank Commissioners with
out requiring any action on the part of the
direoors.
Defendant's motion for a non-suit will
thereforer.be granted.

A Noisy City Convention

visors.
DISGRACEFUL SCENES ON THE
STAGE.
Hisses, Tells and an Attempt to Hurl
Speakers From the Piatform Widen
Democracy's Fatal Feud.
It was the verdict of every spectator
that saw the disgraceful scenes enacted in
Sam Rainey's Democratic Municipal Con
vention at Odd Fellows' Hall last night
that no more disgusting chapter ever
came to light in the history of local
politics.
The conduct of the boss and his hench
men was such as to dissust the lovers of
fair play and widen tbe breach between
warring clans beyond all hope of repara
tion. From start to finish the scenes
enacted were riotous, the slate was iron
clad and the programme cut and dried
â  Irom the outset. The chairman was Dr.
Ragan, who knew his slate well.
There was one noted exception. James
D. Phelan, who nas been disgusted ever
sinca he had seen the slate on Super
visors, developed strength enough to fore
stall the nomination of Rainey's hench
men. He intimidated the boss and forced
a postponement of the nominations until
to-morrow night by refusing to run on the
same ticket with tbe chattels on whose
necks the unsavory Sam had placed his
collars. He wanted to run the machine
himself.
There was nothing calm, deliberate or

gentlemanly about a single act of the con
vention, every step of whose deliberations
was marred by boorish conduct.bulldozing
.and profanity. When Peter McArdle oi
the Thirty-fifth Assembly District arose to
protest against John F. McGovern's
nomination for County Clerk Sergeant
at-Arms Kennedy caught him by
the nape of the neck and was about
to boost him off ftom the platform in true
bouncer style when Secretary Saulman in
terfered. It seemed for a time that there
would be a free fight. McArdle finally
fled from the stage in terror amid such
hissing as might have eminated from a
den of snakes.
To cap the growing climax of disgust,
after some of the delegates had been rid
den over roughshod by the Rainey hood
lums who ran the machine, E. P. E. Troy
arose and said: "I move that we nom
inate for Coroner the boss who owns v& â
Sam Rainey."- This .was the signal for
cat-calls, hisses and general chaos.
The formal business of the convention
was simple in the extreme, the programme
being carried out substantially as ar
ranged by King Rainey at his home Sun*
day night. â¢
W. H. Harrison resigned as candidate
for Assemblyman in the Thirty-second
District, having discovered that as an
officer in the customs service he could not
run for a State office. J. W. Powers was
â Ã¼bstitoted. At this juncture a number of
candidates for Assemblymen made vigor
orons complaint at an attempt of the sec
retary to assess them $10 each, saying I
they we're responsible to their districts I

to swell the sack of the bourbons.
After William Jordan's name was pro
posed for Supervisor of the First Ward
tbe/e was an ominous silence, after which
a motion was carried that the nomination
for Supervisors be postponed until
Wednesday night.
The chairman appeared confused; there
were calls for a division when the vote had
been taken; then there was a pause, dur
ing which ti.e knowing ones g&ve tbe
wink which meant that King Rainey de
sired a postponement, and the motion
prevailed. Phelan had triumphed, but
the henchmen were sullen and silent, all
the same.
R. L. Mann of the Thirty-fourth District
nominated John McGovern for County
Clerk, whereupon a voice cried out: "I
move we break the slate!" It was then
that aged Peter McArdle, a pale, thin man,
was rash enough to mount the rostrum.
Chairman Ragan recognized him, and Mc-
Ardle said:
"Jb'ellow-citizens. McGovern's shameful
disregard of all former pledges disqualifies
him for this honorable position, lor "
The speaker could go no further on ac
count of a storm of catcalls and a volley
of Li6ses. There were cries of "Sit
down, Whiskers 1" "Get onto your
self!" "Put him out!" and
like expressions. Then Bergeant-at-Arms
Kennedy, a butly fellow witn the pby.-iog
nomy of a professional bouncer, mounted
the stage with tbe cat-like motion of an
acrobat, seized tbe a^ed orator by the
nape of the neck, and by a lower
ho.d on his garments was about to
hurl the would-be slaie-breaker from the
platform, whereupon Secretary Saulman
stepped in as referee and peacemaker and
prevented a general tight, for delegates
were yelling, hissing, shaking their fists at
one another, pounding on chairs and
threatening to do violence.
Quiet was finally restored, whereupon
Captain John F. Foley arose to second
McGovern's nomination. He was hissed
at the outset, but he finally said : "Let us
cease, these disgraceful scenes, quit our
bickering and noisy fighting and get down
to work. I want to see no more such dis
graceful scenes as we have just witnesjed."
McGovern's nomination was forced on
the noisy mob, much to the disgust of a
large laction tnat felt almost angry enough
to bolt and leave the hall.
L. F. Byir.gton then nominated Richard
I. Whelan ior Sheriff amid hisses and
cheers. The nomination was seconded by
O'Donnell of the Forty-fourth, then rail
roaded through without serious hitch.
There was a great fuss over nominations
for County Recorder, Thomas J. Pinder
finally defeating Samuel Pollock by a vote
of 493 to 78. Curron of the Thirty-nfih
declined to vote, saying: "She's all cut
and dried and it does no good to vote or
open your mouth here." Pinder's nomi
nation was resented in a noisy way by his
opponents.
Dr. Maximus Magnus was nominated
for Coroner before his opponents had a
chance to say Jack Robinson. It was then
that E. P. E. Troy took the platform and
complained that there was no use to hope
to beat the slate. '.'As who can do
nothing else I move we nominate for
Coroner the boss who owns vs â Sam
Rainey. He can run the office as well
as he runs the convention." There were
hisses and yells, and Troy fled from the
stage before the belligerent serjeant-at
arms could catch him.
Captain A. C. Freese was nominated for
Public Administrator without a dissenting
voice, after which there was a call for
nominations for District Attorney. No
one responded. Then a voice cried, "Are
we waiting for the tip from Rainey?
Where is he?" Then the knowing ones
smiled and John F. Foley moved that the
matter be postponed until Wednesday.
The motion was carried, for bo Phelan
had commanded, and Rainey, fearing
trouble, had obeyed. The "push" was
disgruntled, and many said, "We won't
do a thing to that Kid-gloved jimmy when
we gets the chance!"
William Asmussen was nominated for
Treasurer and Professor James H. Sim
mons of the Boys' High School for Superin
tendent of Schools without a hitch.
Delegate Hassett then moved that a
committee of eighteen, in addition to the
chairman and secretary, be appointed to
select School Directors. The chair ap
pointed the committee, and widened the
breach by omitting from the list the
man who made the motion. The fol
lowing comprise the committee, and
they will meet at the Flood
building to-night: William Turner, Law
rence Brennan, J. T. Cunningham, George
Love, John T. Ryan, John A. Holland, J.
T. Dowllng, L. F. Nye, William Crowley,
William Handy, T. F. Clarke, Dr.
O'Rourke, J. L. Franklin, J. F. Reilly,
John W. Davis, A. C. Davis, John A.
Lynch ana R. c. Hooe.
The convention was now over, the push
had bten partly thwaited and greatly an
gered, and the breach between the Rainey
factions widened beyond hope of repara
tion. It was freely rumored that Phelan
had demanded the right to name seven
Supervisors, and the men who trade in
corruption were so angry that they were
pale.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1896.
"This millionaire art critic demands too
much," said a ward-heeler, "and we will
have to cet in and turn him down" ; and
this was the general feeling among the
disgrnntled, who were numerous.
Mr. Phelan was seen after the conven
tion and spoke quite fully on the question
of Supervisors, practically admitting that
he had encouraged tue breaking of the
slate.
"The ticket proposed developed great
weakness in places," he said, "and I en
couraged the movement to bring out bet
ter men in the various wards. In the in
terim Between now and Wednesday I
think tbe ticket will be strengthened."
But there are others â many others â who
object to thepulling down of their idols,
and who say they will give Mr. Pbelan
something to meditate over if he persists
in throwing stones at the slate duly pre
pared by the powers they respect.
There is. trouble in the air and tne Junta
is in great confusion by reason of numer
ous riots in its own wigwams.
OFFENDS "DE PUSH."
Phelan's Record on Stiver and Art
Startles the Unwashed.
From the developments of yesterday it
is apparent that the Democratic party of
San Francisco is hopelessly disrupted and
divided beyond hope of reconciliation.
It wan a busy day in the ranks of the
warrine factions. The "blind devil" of
the Bourbons, his Excellency Christopher
Buckley, honored the City with his pres
ence all day, deftly pulling wires and lay
ing plans to loot the City. The Democ
racy's attack on the City treasury did not
end, however, with tbe machinations of
the worthy Christopher, for the left wing
of the cormorants was under the general
ship of his Royal Majesty Samuel Rainey.
Conservative Democrats who have been
studying the situation with care lately
have concluded that the Bourbons are
hopelessly divided ; that the decent men
of all shades and colors of Democratic
belief are done with bossism, and that
their votes will probably relegate Buckley
and Rainey to the background for all
time.
The more minutely one studies the local
situation the more serious the \arious de
fections become. There is a large element
bitterly opposed to the candidacy of James
Phelan for Mayor, and several circum
stances contribute to the young million
aire's unpopularity. At the outset he is a
"gold bug," and this makes him forbid
den fruit to the silverites of the Democ
racy, who look upon any other Democrat
than the 16 to 1 brand as worse than Judas
of old. As the duys roll on the goid in
fection of Phelan becomes more dangerous
to his prospects, for as the silver men
grow more voluble they grow more angry.
In the hearing of many crazy silverites
the mention of Phelan's name has already
become like a red flag in the sight of an
angry bull.
Another great point of objection to
Phelan in tbe eyes of many is that he de
clined to go to the Chicago Convention as
a yeoman for his party. Many look upon
this as tbe unpardonable sin, and they
will remember Pbelan in tne booth at thn
solemn hour when the spirits of just men
mete out equity to the erring.
The fact that Mr. Phelan is a millionaire
art critic and connoisseur in matters liter
ary has alienated many voters from him
in the regions of dense and unchanging
Democracy. A canvass in the thickly
populated Democratic precincts south of
Market, where a "biled" shirt is a crime,
shows that "de push" of the Bourbons
cannot swallow "de guy what wears kid
gloves."
Insignificant as these objections may
seem in cold print they are a potent influ
ence in the realms of the Democracy. Mr.
Pljelan begins to realize that he is re
garded as a man to be feared for bis clot hes,
nis education and his manners. There in
a rumor that Roosevelt, the purist, is
Phelan's ideal and that he would do all in
bis power to maice the City as holy as the
silent ci'ies of New England, that he
would "Roosevelt the town," and to the
average Democrat nothing couid be more
terrible than such a misfortune. The
masses are beginning to fear that Phelan' s
ejection would mean a long farewell to
side entrances and steam bear â calamities
that the Democrats will avert at any cost.
DIMOND'S CAMPAIGN.
War Against the Charter and for
Municipal Ownership
cf Utilities.
Joseph I. Dirnond, the candidate of the
Buckleyites for Mayor, who will undoubt
edly be indorsed by the Populists, declared
yesterday that he was going to make an
aggressive ficht asainst the new- charter
and in faror of the municipal ownership
of -as and water works.
"If there develops any organized fight
against the charter I will take part in it,"
said Mr. Dimond yesterday, "and if there
is not I will do what I can by my own
efforts.
"I think the greatest misfortune that
could befall this City would be its
adoption. It confers the powers of a
Czar on the Mayor, and enaoles
one man who would be the tool
of corporations if they could elect their
candidate, to exercise far greater power
then any boss who ever ruled the City. It
wouLl enable him to perpetuate himself
in power or to name his successor.
"Its friends are now beginning to admit
that there are faults in the charter, but
they say that it cair be amended; but the
charter contains no provision for amend
ment and when we fall back on tne
general law and the constitution we find
that once in two years an amendment
could be submitted to the people
and then a three-fifths vote would
he required for its adoption. A boss
ridden government might prevent amend
ments being submitted to the people, and
all around the chances are against any
amendment.
"Although the Mayor under the present
law has not great independent power he
can exercise a very powerful influence by
wise efforts, if he takes an active part in
the affairs of the City.
"One of my other objections to the char
ter is that it draws the public schools into
politics.
"If I were elected Mayor, I would advo
cate strongly the municipal ownership of
water and light plants by the City,
The existing law gives us the right to pur
cnase existing plants or to acquire new
ones. There have been laid before the
Supervisors plans that would undoubtedly
reduce water rates from $7 to $2. I
believe in bonding the City to ac
quire these utilities. This is the les
son taught by all cities owning
such works. Let the proposition be
submitted to the people and I believe that
they would vote overwhelmingly in its
favor.
"I believe in the dollar limit and in fact
in a less rate. This City could he
run handsomely on $4,000,000 a
year. The whole remedy for bad
government is to elect a good Board of
Supervisors. Let the people select honest,
able and worthy men."
Mr. Dimond's friends say that his cam
paign will be a vigorous and aggressive
one when it gets started.

POPULISTS TAKE UP
THE BUCKLEYITES
Thomas Cator and Chris
Buckley Effect a Great
Deal.
MAYOR TO LEGISLATURE
Preparing to Put Up Candidates
for All the Lccal
0 fices.
DIMOND'S ANTI-CHARTER WAR
Buckleyites Kick Frank J. Mnrasky
From Their Ticket and Plan a
Hot Campaign.
The regular local Democracy, otherwise
known as the Buckleyites, has played an
other trump. They have effected a fusion
with the Populists and expect to add the
force of the local Populist party to the
blow they will deal to Sam Rainey's out
fit, and especially to James D. Phelan and
to the Junta legislative ticket.
The local Buckleyite and Populist lead
ers have been in constant consultation re
cently, and the upshot is that the Popu
lists have agreed to indorse the Buckley
ticket practically from top to bottom.
The Buckleyites had to bid high for this
ally. The Populists are to cet half the
municipal patronage for one thing.
The most important feature of the deal,
however, is that the Buckleyites are all to
vote for T. V. Cator for the Senate. This
is really the nigger in the woodpile.
While Cator has been busy throughout
the State making combinations for the
Legislature on the basis of Populist As
semblymen for himself and Democratic
Assemblymen for White two years hence
be has not for a moment neglected tiie
eighteen Assemblymen who are to be
elected from this City, and this outcome is
the result of his studying, pulling and ex
ercise of judgment.
However, otber things made the condi
tions favorable for a local fusion with the
Buckleyites, rather than with the Junta.
The Buckleyites are the silver wing of the
local Democracy, while the gold bugs are
herded in the Rainey camp.
That is partly why Joseph |I. Dimond,
the Buckley candidate, will De indorsed
instead of James D. Phelan, unless a hard
and-fast bargain be broken unexpectedly
within two days. Phelan is an out-and"
out gold man. an i refused to go to the
Chicago convention as a delegate for that
reason. That surely puts Phelan out of
the race for indorsement. John Daggett
and the rest of the gold men who run the
Junta are equally distasteful to the Popu
lists.
Oa the other hand Dimond is
an avowed advocate of the public
ownership of public utilities, tne
cardinal feature of the Populist muni
cipal policy, and after looking him up one
side and down thÂ« other the Populists
have decided thai be is all right.
The Populists did not take up the ticket
last nignt, but the programme will un
doubtedly be carried out during the week.
Sam Braunhart, the Junta candidate fur
Senator in the Nineteenth District, seems
likely to win indorsement, but the excep
tions to the indorsement of the Buckley
legislative ticket will probably be few.
Â£hr Buekleyite* i.aye other trumps up
their sieeve. Their suit to get on the offi
cial ballot as Democrats is now pending
before the Supreme Court and a decision
is expected this week. If they are denied
t. c use of the party name conjointly with
the Junva, they will instantly make other
important moves in the courts and the
tangle and the uncertainty of litigation
may continue until election day.
They will, however, be prepared for
emergencies, and to guard against the
possibility of being kept off the ticktt
altogether they will prepare a petition
containine the names of 3 per ceni of the
voters, and will file it at least twenty days
before election with the Registrar. They
will thus be sure of getting on the ticket
by petition, if in no other wav, and will
continue their legal battle daring the rest
of the time.
All possibility of union with the Junta
wing of the local Demociacy is conceded to
be past, and the tinht will go on to t..e
deatn. The Buckleyites are perfecting
arrangements for a perfectly organized
fight on the plan of Tammany Hall, hav
ing district and precinct men to work,
watch and report and act in harmony with
and under the orders, of he bosses in
higher authority. T c Buckleyites will
di igently ply tbe knife on Pfaelan and the
rest of the Rainey ticket. Phelan will
make a pro-charter fighth t and Dimond an
anti-charter fight, and tne local Demo
cratic fur will fly.
A BLOW AT MURASKY.
The Buckleyites Kick Him Off
Their Judicial Ticket.
The regular weekly meeting of the gen
eral committee of the Buckleyites at
headquarters last evening was a big but a
brief one. Many members of tne faction
were out at the Populists' tent to see how
their fusion with the Pops* was getting
along, and half of those who wore at the
meeting wanted to go.
About all the business that Chairman
Rothschild and Secretary D. M. Gavigan
had to direct was the settlement with
Frank J. Murasky for having* "thrown
them down" and accepted a nomination
for Superior Judge from the Junta conven
tion.
At the time the Buckley convention was
in session Murasky's friends worked hard
to secure his nomination for the Superior
bench, and succeeded. Then the Junta
convention came along, and Murasky's
political friends played for that nomina
tion. As the Junta resolved at the start
not to indorse a single candidate of the
Buckleyites, a resignation from that ticke:
was a requisite. Here was a dilemma,
and in it the Murasky council decided on
the resignation, hoping to keep the other
nomination, too, by squaring things later.
During the time last week when the
judicial slate of tbe Junta was being made
up, Stephen V. Coatello of the law firm of
Henley & Costello was certain of the
nomination, and he was on the slate until
6p. m. of the day when the nominations
were made. At that late hour Joseph E.
O'Donnell, Frank J. Smith and others in
terested in Murasky, succeeded in getting
him on the slate, and to make room for
him Costello was pulled down.
The Buckleyites instantly declared war
on Frank J. Murasky, and they declared
that they "wouldn't do a thing to him."
Smith, O'Donneli and others have for
days been making frantic efforts to square
the tning. Their success is indicated in
the following carefully prepared resolu
tions, introduced last night by P. H.
Shanley and adopted with a whoop:
W HErkas, A declination of a nomination for
Superior Judge made by our late convention
has been received from Frank J. Murasky at
the command of the boss of the Junta couven
tion, whose nomination for the said office
Murasky has received and which was made
conditional upon the aforesaid declination
being forwarded to this committee; and
Whereas, It Is a fact that the lrieads of the
said Frank J. Mursslty did persistantly haunt
the rooms or headquarters of this committee
for days and nights prior to the assembling of
our late municipal nominating convention,
and did play the role of button-holers in be
nalf of the aspiring Murasky for ju
dicial honors; and whereas, tbe repre
sentations of Murasky's friends as to
his individuality and high sense of honor, so
impressed the delegates of our late convention
that It resulted in his unanimous nomination
by the convention for Superior Judge; and
whereas, the said Murasky gave his word of
honor as r man that "if nominated he would
not be influenced by any man, set of men, or
organization, to decline the nomination which
he was then seeking:, and that he would not
consider himself a man if he was guilty of such
action ' ; and whereas, said Murasky to further
his ambition to become a Judge of tie Superior
Court of the State of California in and for the
City and County of San Krancisco has seen fit
t0 repudiate and decline the said nomination
which he sough: as aforesaid ; therefore be it
Resolved, That we, the members of the Gen
eral Committee of the Democratic party of the
City and County of San Francisco, approve of
the action of the committee ou vacancies In
taking off and erasing the name of Frank J.
Murasky, candidate for Superior Judge, from
our ticket; and be it further
Resolved, That we call upon all members of
this General Committee and the supporters of
this organization to oppose the election ot
Murasky.
Resolved, That the citizens of San Francisco
are counseled against placing upon the Supe
rior bench a man who has thus given evidence
of a weak and vacillating organization which
is not in harmony with the requirement* of a
Juage of the Superior Court in passing upon
personal aDd property rights, the object for
which all government is Instituted
Resolved, Tnat 75,000 copies of the aforesaid
preamble and resolutions be printed for dis
tribution among the registered electors of the
City and County.
The committee on vacancies, consisting
of James I. Stanton, Samuel Newman,
Charles McCarthy, J. J. Flynn and W. F.
Humphrey, will in a day or two name ex-
Judge F. W. Lawler in Murasky's place.
Lawler was an aspirant for the Buckley
nomination for Superior Judge, but, it is
said, he was kept off to make room for
Murasky.
Lawler was nominated for Police Judge,
but declined the nomination next day.
Now he will go back on the ticket.
It was decided to have a meeting of the
candidates, the executive committee and
the purity committee on Thursday even
ing and the committee adjourned.
WILL WED A PROFESSOR,
Miss Sophia Newland's Engage
ment to Dr. Neustadt Is
Announced
The Bride-El â¬ct Is a Native Daughter
Who Has Sung in Public All
Over the State.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Sept. 28. f
The engagement of Miss Sophia Newland,
the daughter of Edward Newland of this
Miss Sophia Newland, the Singer, "Who Is to Marry a Professor of
Edinburgh, Scotland*
city, and Eugene Neustadt, M. C. P. of
Watson's College of Edinburgh, Scotland,
was announced to-day.
Miss Newland is a native daughter of
California and is a musician of more than
local fame. She made her debut at the
commencement exercises of Snell's Sem
inary in 1885 after careful training by
local teachers. She made a decided suc
cess, but was not satisfied with herself
and finally went to Europe to study under
the masters of tbe Continent. It was
while in London in 1892 preparing for her
studies that Miss Newland met her fate.
The acquaintance made then continued
during her stay abroad and ripened into a
mutual affection.
Among a few intimate friends the mat
ter of her engagement was spoken of.
Miss Newland has sung at all the best
musical functions; at the Loring Club con
certs; at the Carr Beel Pops; with th 6
Oakland Ensomble Club and the Har
monic Society ; at John W. Metcalf and
Robert Tolmie pianoforte recitals; with
ticmund Beel and Mrs. Carr at the Athe
nseum, Berkeley; at Stanford University ;
with Hermann Brandt, Louis Heine and
Ella Partridge; at the best concerts in San
Jose and Sacramento, at Burlington, lowa,
and St. Paul, Minnesota.
Mr. Neustadt is a native of France, his
father being German and his mother
French. He is a graduate of Heidelberg
University and gets his title from London,
where he was made master of the College
of Preceptors. For the past eighteen
years he has been the head of the French
department of Watson's College, the
largest boys' school in Great Britain. He
was a visitor to America in 1876, coming
here to attend the Centennial.

the celebrated case, so it is not thought at all
likely that Collins will succeed in his mission.

L, F, AUZERAIS
WEDS A NURSE
Cupid Again Wooes the De
posed Husband of Mrs.
Hoyt.
HIS FRIENDS SURPRISED
The Wedding Ceremony Took
Place the Present Month
in Paris.
THE BRIDE'S HOME IN OAKLAND
Her Sister, Miss Mattie Covell, Says
Publicity His Been Avoided as
Far as Possible.
L. F. Auzerais has again married. This
time the young sculptor nas chosen for
his bride a Miss Covell of Oakland. The
young lady is a trained nurse, well known
in the city across the bay.
The wedding ceremony ocenrred in
Paris during the present month and was a
surprise to tbe relatives of both tbe par
ties. The particulars gleaned regarding
the ceremony are necessarily meager,
owing to the reticence of those who know
most about it.
It will be remembered that after Au
zerais' hrst wife obtained a divorce from
him and married Hereward Hoyt their
troupe went to Alaska and made a great
financial failure. It then returned to San
Francisco, and Hereward took his wife
East. From time to time rumors are
wafted over the Rockies that Mrs. Hoyt's
second marital venture, so far as inconi
patiDility of temperament is concerned, ,
has not been more successful than her
first. / â¢
Auzerais himself then went to Paris,
where he has now astonished *nis friends
by remarrying. That he be'ieves mar
riage with actresses not a successful ven
ture is evidenced by his recent cnoice.
Miss Mattie Covelf, sister to the bride,
was seen to-night at the Young Woman's
Christian Association home in .Oakland
and admitted that her sister was married
during the present month in Paris to L.
F. Auzerais. She refused to give any of
the particulars of the ceremony, but con
fessed that it was somewhat of a surprise.
She would not say whether the young
couple would return to Oakland or remain
abroad. As the family did not desire any
publicity she would say nothing more.
THE MINERS' MONEY.
Silverltes Keep the Bryan Cam-
paign From Wholly Lan
guishing.
The Democratic campaign continues to
be conducted mainly at the expense of
the millionaire silver miners and' by the
silver organization.
W. P. Lawlor, chairman of the Silver
campaign committee, believes in campaign
novelties and can afford them. The magic
lantern advertising men on Market street
find him their best-paying patron.
Lawlor has just found the first free
silver preacher whose intereat in politics
bag been announced and has hir d Metro
politan Temple for him for Thursday
evening. He is Rev. Edwards Cator Davis,
the sensational young Christian minister
of Oakland.
Tbe Silverites have hired both the
Grove-street Theater and Union Hall,
which was formerly Morosco's, for the
campaign. They will be used as head
quarters for free-silver workingmen's or
ganizations and for workingmen's mass
meetings.
The silverites are expecting to send forth
quite a horde of speakers soon. Most of
them will be Democrats well known in
former campaigns.
Congressman Maguire will speak In Los
Angeles on the 30th inst., on his way home
from the East.
The Democratic State Central Com
mittee has just issued its first bit of
campaign literature. The Democracy
has so far depended on the
Silverites, the National Committee
and franked copies of Congressional
speeches for literature and its distribution.
This new work is entitled "Plain Talks to
\vorkingmen," and is by T. Carl Spelling
