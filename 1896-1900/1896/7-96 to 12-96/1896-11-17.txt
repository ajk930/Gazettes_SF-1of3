WRIGHT ACT CONSTITUTIONAL
Five Years of Litigation
Terminated at Last.
Decision of the Supreme Court Sus=
taining the Validity of the Vexed
Irrigation Law.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 16.â After
litigation extending over a period of live
Or six years, the California statute locally
known as the Wright irrigation law has
beea pronounced to be constitutional and
" valid by the Supreme Court of the United
f States, and the validity of $10,000,000 of
y bonds issued thereunder affirmed.
The decision was announced in the Su
preme Court to-day by Justice Peckham.
in the case of the Fallbrook irrigation
Distr'ct et al. vs. Maria King Bradley and
husband, appealing from the Circuit Court
for the Southern District of California.
There was another appeal before the
court, also involving the same law, dis
posed of at to-day's session of the Supreme
Court, which came from the Supreme
Court of the State â William Tregea vs. tbe
Modesto Irrigation District. The courts
below entered diametrically opposite judg
ments, the Circuit Court holding that the
law was unconstitutional and the Su
preme Court of the State holding that it
was constitutional.
The Tregea case had been before^the
Supreme Court of tbe United States for
more than two years, and after having
been argued once was assigned for another
argument, in connection with the Fall
brook case. The argument took place last
April, ex-President Harrison supporting
the law.
The complainants in the two cases at
tacked the Jaw on the ground that it was
â¢unconstitutional, violating both the State
and Federal constitutions, tne latter in
â¢ effect that it took away private property
without due process of law. Judge
McKenna of the Circut Court decided that
tne act did practically take the property
of the Bradleys, who are alien residents of
San Diego County, without due process of
law, and granted the injunction asked for.
In the opinion, disposing of the case,
Justice Peckham refers to the vast extent
of the "arid region," and the great im
portance to those residing in it, of the
scbeiL-e to improve its condition by irriga
tion. Taking tne California law as a
model, be said seven or eight other Stales
in the arid belt had passed similar laws
to assess lands for the cost of constructing
irrigating works and condemning other
lanus for right of way of these works,
proceedings under which were awaiting
the result of the pending litigation.
O:;e ol the points made by the counsel
was that the irrigation of arid lands was
not c. public purpose, and this was dis
cussed in the opinion at length in con
nection with the power of the Legislature
lo pass a law providing for the accom
plishment of that purpose. The Supreme
Court found no difficulty, Justice Peckham
said, in coming to the same conclusion
reached by the California State Court â
thai the irrigation of arid lands. is a public
purpose, that tne water thus used is put
to a public nse, and that an act providing
for irrigation is a valid exercise of the
legislative power.
. A second objection urged by the prop
.erty-owners was that the operations of tne
act need not be and are not limited to
arid, unproductive lands, but include
witain its possibilities all lands, no mat- '
. ter how fertile or productive, so long- as
they are susceptible ".n their natural
state" to one mode of irrigation from a
common source, the special point being
that it was unlawful to include tho city of
Modesto in an irrigation district. But the
Supreme Court of California said it was
undoubtedly intended by the Legislature
that cities and towns in proper cases
should ne included in such districts, and
that the act thus construed did not violate
the State constitution, and that view of
the law tbe Supreme Court of the "United
States adopted.
As to the construction of the act upon
the third point raised the Supreme Court
of the United States' held that it provided
for a hearing of the land-owner both as to
the question whether his land would be
benetited by the proposed irrigation, and
when that had been decided in favor of j
the benefit then upon the question of
valuation and assessment of and upon his
land included in the district. As to other
matters the district could be created with
out notice to any one.
"Our conclusion," says the decision, "is
that the act, a3 construed with reference
to the objections considered under this
third head, is unassailable."
lhe fourth and final objection was as to
the basis of assessment upon the lands
b T.efiied, that it amounted to a taking of
the property of the citizen without due
process of law. Regarding this the
opinion says: .
"Tne method of assessment here" pro
vided for may not be lhe best which could
have been adopted In order to accomplish
the most equal and exact justice which
the nature of the case permits. But none
the less we are unable to say that it runs
counter to any provision of the Federal
constitu ion, and we must, for that rea
son, hoJd the objection licre considered to
be untenable."
The judgment of the Circuit Court was,
therefore, overruled, and the case re
manded for further proceeding not incon
sistent with tne opinion of the Supreme
Court of the United States.
Chief Justice Fuller and Justice Field,
it was announced, dissented from the
opinion of the court.
. The decision <f the court in the case of
' the Modesto district, vhich came from
k.the Supreme Court of the State, was an
nounced by Justice Brewer. The consti
tutionality of the law, he said, had been
nettled by the decision in the Fallbrook
case, and the Modesto case was disposed
briefly on the ground that it presented
no question for the Supreme Court of the
(United States to dec:do. Tne proceedings
irom which Tre Â£ ea appealed simply gaye

authority to i'sue bonds.
"As no bonds were issued," said Justice
Brewer, "and the prceeedine does not
compel the issue of any, and tbey may
not be issued at all, no such suit is pre
sented as c:ills for consideration and deci
sion by this court. For this reason the
appeal will be dismissed.
"Justices Harlan, Gray and Brown,
however," he continued, "are of the opin
ion that as the judgment of the State
court was against a right and privilege
specially set up and claimed by the plain
tiff in error under the constitution of the
United States, such judgment if not modi
fied or revised will include him if not all
tbe holders of taxable property in the
Modesto irrigation district in respect of
the Federal right and privilege so alleged ;
consequently it is the duty of this court
to determine upon its merits the Federal
question so raised by the pleadints and
determined by the judgment of the State
court. Ihey aro also of the opinion that
the principles announced in the Failbrook
case sustain the conclusion* of the State
cnurt upon this Federal question and re
quire the affirmance of its judgment."
MAJORITY OPINION.
Reasons for Sustaining the Validity
of tho Wright Act.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 16.â The
| majority opinion of the Supreme Court in
I the Failbrook irrigation case is volumin
| ous, comprising twenty-two printed
; pages. Justice Peckman, who delivered
the opinion of the court, said:
We nre confined in this case to the inquiry
whether the act in question (Wright irrigation
iaw), as it has been construed by the State
courts, violates the Federal constitution. The
assertion that it does is Dnsed upon that part
of the fourteenth amendment of the constittu
tion which reads as follows: "Nor shall any
j State deprive any person or life, liberty or
| property without due process of law, nor deny
to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws."
In rod rriiig to tlie amendment above quoted
the appellees herein urge several objections to
this act. They say:
Firstâ Thai tha use for whica writer is to be
procured is not in any sense a public one, be
cause it is limited to laud-owners who may be
buch at the time when water is to be appor
tioned, and the interest of the public is noth
ing more than that indirect and collateral
benefit that it derives irom every improve
ment of useful character that is made in the
State.
Secondâ They assert that under the act In
question the irrigation of lands need not be
i imitea to those which are in fact unproduc
tive, but that by its very terms the act in
cludes nil lands which are susceptiblo of one
mode of irrigation from a common source, and
no matter how fertile or productive they may
already be, and it is denied that the furnis h
ing of a fertilizer for lands of individual pro
prietors which are already productive, in order
to make them more productive, is in any legal
sense public Improvement.
Thirdâ lt is also objected that under the act
the land-owner has no right to demand and
no opportunity U given him for a hearing on
the question whether his land is or can be
benefited by Irrigation as proposed; also that
he has no right to a hearing upon the ques
tion whether the statute has been complied
with in preliminary and requisite to the lor
mation of a district.
Fourthâ That the basis of assessment for the
cos; of construction is not in accordance with
and in proportion to benefit transferred by
improvement, and finally, that lard which
cannot, in fact, be benefited may yet under
the act be placed in one of the irrigation dis
tricts and assessed upon us value to pay the
cost of construction of works which benefit
others at his expense. These are the main ob
jections urged acrninst the act.
Coming to a review of tnese various objec
tions, we think the flnÂ«tâ that the water Is not
for public useâ is not well founded. The
question what constitutes public use has been
before trie courts of many of the States and
their decisions have not been harmonious, the
inclination of some of these courts being
toward a narrower and more limited defini
tion of such use than those of others.
There is no specific prohibition in the Fed
eral constitution which acts upon States to
their taking private pror-erty for any but
public use. The fifth amendment, which pro
vides among otner things that such property
â¢hall not be taken for public use without just
compensation, applies only to the Federal
Government, as haÂ» many times been decided.
In the fourteenth amendment provision re
garding the taking of private property is
omitted, and prohibition against the State is
confined to its depriving any person of life,
liberty or property without due processof law.
It is cimrned, however, that a citizen :s de
prived of his property without due process of
lawii it be taken by or under State authority
for any other than a public use, either under
| guUeof taxation or by iissumption of right of
eminent domain. In that way the question
whether private property has "been taken for
any other than a public use becomes material
iv ihis court, even where the taking is under
the authority of the State instead oi the Fed
eral Government. The Supreme Court of Cali
fornia has held in a number of cases that ihe
irrigation net is In accordance with the con
stitution and that it do,;s not deprive land
owners of any property without dne process
of law; that the use of water for irrigation
purposes under the provisions oi the act is
public use, and corporations organized by
virtue of the HCt for the purpose of irrigation
are public municipal corporations organized
for the promotion of prpsperlty and the wel
fare of the people.
We 'to not assume that these various state
mentsâconstitutional ana legislative â to
gether with decisions of tne State court are
couensive and binding upon this court upon
ihe question as to what is a due process oi
law. As here presented these are questions
which also arise under the Federal constitu
tion, and we must decide them in accordance
with our views of constitutional law. It is
obvious, however, that what is public use
frequently and largely depends upon tno fncis
and circumstances surrounding the particu
lar subject matter in regard to which the
character of use is questioned.

where there is no color of necessity therefor

THE MINING CINDERELLA AND THE CABINET SLIPPER.
SHE CAN WEAR IT.
MINERS DEMAND A CABINET PLACE
The further investigation goes. in the I
question of establishing a raining bureau !
or department in connection with the j
general administration of the executive '
department of the Federal Government !
the more conclusive is the evidence that |
miners are suffering from an inst'.equate I
administration, and that their vast and '
important interests are squandered and '
sacrificed because there is no proper un- |
derstanding of their business by the de- I
partments of government that have
ch.-irge of the matter.
R. M. McMurray, a well-known miner of
Ouray, Colo., is an enthusiastic advocate
Of the plan of a mining department in the j
Cabinet. In speaking of the matter yes- ,
terday he said :
"Our interests are surely of enough imÂ«
portance to attract attention, standing, as j
tbey do, second only to agriculture and i
manufactures. I have experienced for !
many years the inconvenience and injus- ;
tice of having to adjust my affairs through
a department that is icnorancof mining ,
mattery, and I am fuiiy ripe for a plan i
that puts our affairs in business shape and i
in such a manner that there will be no de- \
lay in adjusting our important interests. 1 ' j
William H. Ciary of Stockton, owner of
the Sheep Ranch mineâ We ought to have â¢
a Secretary of Mining beyond any douot. ;
The matter when urged at the California \
miners' meeting received the approval of
those who expressed themselves, and I do
not doubt that it would meet with ap- >
proval among miners everywhere. We j
have waited already too long without i
recognition for this great industry. There I
is too much business for the Secretary of !
the Interior to transact, so the work oticht j
to be divided up and a new Cabinet officer '
appointed. The mining interests are very
large, extending over an enormous sec
tion, comprising many States. If we had :
a Secretary of Mining I think mining ',
v.ould be advanced. We could then get \
recognition, commensurate probably with ]
tne importance of mining. We certainly j
need a man in the Cabinet to represent '
mining as much as we need a man in the !
Chair of Agriculture. Another reason j
why I am for a Mining Secretary i* be- >
cause I think California would probably j
get the place. This is tbe oldest and I
wealthiest of the mining States. It hns !
led the way, and by right ought to be
recognized over all other States.
the purpose of rendering ordinary cultivation
of the land reasonably remunerative, might
be regarded by the courts as an improper ex
ereiS'j of legislative will, and the use might
not be held to be public iv any constitutional
absence, no matter how many owners were in
tureste-l In the scheme.
On the other hand, in a State like California,
which confessedly embraces millions of acres
of arid lands, an net of the Legislature pro
viding for their irrigation might well be re
garded as an act devoting water to public use.
and, therefore, as a valid exercise of legisla
tive power. The people of California and
members of ncr Legislature must in the nature
of things be more lamiliar with the feet* and
circumstances whicli surround the subject,
and with the necessaries and occasion for irri
gation of lands than can any one be who is
it stranger to her soil. This knowledge and
fainillnrlty must have their weight with State
courts which nre to paw upon the question of
public use in the sight ol facts which surround
the subject in their own State. For these
reasons, while not regarding the matter as
concluded by the various declarations and
acts and decisions of the people and Legisla
ture and courts of California, we yet, In con
sideration of tho subject, accord and treat
them with very great respect, and we regard
decisions as embodying deliberate judgment
George D. McLane, the widely known I
mine-owner and manager of Grass Valleyâ |
If we can get a man who is well informed
as to nuninc I would say yes. Jet us have a
Secretary of Mining. I think there is no j
doubt that we could get a good man in the
place and so I am in favor of the depart
ment. Mining has been in recent years I
spreading out. There is mining of some
sort in nearly every State. In the West
and on the Pacific Coast mining has grown
enormously. More capital has been in
vested from year to year. It isn't shallow
mining any more, but deep mining, and
this takes a great deal of capital. We cer
tainly deserve a Secretary of Mining if we
have a Secretary of Agriculture. The con
flict between railroads and mining in
terests, which occurred recently in Cali
fornia, has been settled, 1 believe, but the
question is liable to come up again in j
some form; if not with us In other States.
Then, as at present, the debris question is
a matter of controversy, and this should
be settled. The segregation of the mineral
from the agricultural lauds is another j
matter that needs careful attention. I
think there is a great deal for a Secretary
of Mining to do. As the Secretary
familiarizes himself with his work he will
find it crowing in importance. It is cer
tain also to get more and more important
as the country grows older.
J.W. Smith ct Boulder, C>lo. , and an ex
tensive miner in Coloradoâ Of course we
shonld have a Secretary of Mining. Take
Georgia, North and South Carolina and
all the Western States, the coal-mining
States, the lead, the zinc, the phosphate
mines and the great quicksilver, copper,
silver and gold mines, they would all be j
foÂ«tered, and should be. Mining is an in
dustry mere important as a wealth pro
ducer than agriculture, and we have a
Secretary of Agriculture. There is hardly
a State in the Union that is not interested
in some branch of the great mining in- 4
dustry.
C. A. Jndkins of Denverâ The mining
industry ought to be fostered. It is only !
in its infancy, especially here in Califor
nia nnd in Colorado, but there there is
twice the enthusiasm that there is here.
Mining in all its branches is an enormous
industry, and to foster it by some such
means in all its branches would materially
increase the wealth of the country, while
and matured thought of courts of that State
on this question.
Viewing the subject for ourselves and in the
light o! these considerations we have very
littie difficulty in coming to the same conclu
sion reached by the courts of California. The
UFe must be regarded as public use. or else it
would seem to follow that no general scheme
of irrigation can be formed or carried inio
effect. In ge.ieril, water to be used must be
carried for some distance dud over or through
I'l-ivate property, which cannot be token in
.mvitam if the use to which it is to De put be
not public, and if there be no power to take
property by condemnation it may be impossi
ble to acquire it nt nil. The use for which
private property is to "ue taken must be a pub
lic one, whether the tÂ«king te by exercise of
r;ght or of eminent domain or uy that ot taxa
tion.
A private company or corporation without
â  power to acquire laud In invitam would be of
I lio real beuelit, and at any rate the cost of the
' undertaking would be so greatly enhanced by
I the knowledge that land must be acquired by
j purchase that it woald be practically Inipossi
! ble to build works* or obtain water. Individ
ual enterprise would be equally ineffectual.
No one owner would find it possible to con.
struct and maintain water works and canals
any better than private corporations or compa
giving a great many more men employ
ment.
E. J. Field of Denverâ l believe it would
be an exceedingly good thing. I believe it
would advance the industry very materi
ally. Mining is looked upon by many
Eastern people as a gambling scheme,
and to put it before all the nation as an
industry on a footing with agriculture
would be a great help to the development
of mines of all kinds, and would create a
more general and safer interest among in
vestors.
C. K. Colvin, a mining expert of
Denver â I have thought of this matter a
good deal, and I think the appointment
of a Government Secretary of Mining
would oe an excellent thing. The mining
of precious metals is paramount to all
other industries in furnishing ihe life
blood, the means by which others mar be
developed. 1 think it should be made a
special department by itselt and have a
head the same as agriculture.
C. F. Gafiney of Butte, Mont., is one of
the modest, old-time miners who blushes
when he sees his name in print as a rule,
but he said :
"It strikes me that this is a good scheme,
and lam glad The Call advocates it. Of
course if we take too active an interest in
it we might get into trouble where we
have claims pending, but the scheme is all
right all the same."
Congressman Loud had not fully inves
tigated the plans; was a little afraid to
commit himself fully, but said: "I cannot
see anything against the scheme, but l do
not want to boom it too hard until I see
whether we can possibly get the matter
through. Ido not believe it can fail to be
a good thing, but I do not like to get in
over my ears too soon."
C. W. W heeler, a well-known Colorado
mining man, said:
"I do not think a single miner who
ifeeis that his soul is his own and who
Knows anything about the many incon
veniences of the present system can pos
sibly fail to object to it or its workings.
We are harassed and delayed at every
turn of the road. All who know much
about the dilatory methods of the Interior
Department must protest against them
and long for the day ot better methods.
Our people have discussed this matter and
they are a unit in favor of giving the
miners a place in the Cabinet."
nies. and unless they had power of eminent
domain they could accomplish nothing. If
that power could be conferred upon them it
could only oe upon the ground that the prop
erty tbey took was to be taken for a public
purpose.
Uiiiie the consideration that the work of
irrigation must be abandoned if the use of
water may not be held to be or constitute pub
lic uses not to be regarded as conclusive in
iavor of such use, yet that fact is in this case a
most important consideration. Miltlor\s of
acres of land, otherwise cultivable, must be
left in their present arid and worthless condi
tion, and an effectual obstacle will, therefore,
remain in tbe way of the advance of a large
portion of tne State in material wealth and
prosperity. To irrigate and thus to bring into
possible cultivation the;-e larger masses of
otherwise worthless lands would seem to be a
public purpose and a malterof public interest,
not confined to land-owners, or even to any
one section of tbe State. The fact that the use
of water is limited to land-owners Is not, there
fore, a ratal objection to this legislation. It is
not essential that the entire community or
even any considerable portion thereof should

USAL MURDERER CONFESSES
John Dodge Describes the
Mudgett Killing.
Burned the Rancher's Dwelling to
Destroy Evidence of the
Crime.
UKIAH, Cal., Nov. 16.â Stowed away
among the records in the Mendocino
County courthouse is a document that
describes in detail the assassination of
J. A. H. Mudgett, the well-to-do rancher
whose charred body was found in the
ashes of his cabin near Usal three weeks
ago. It is a story of cold-blooded mur
der, horrible in its frankness, though
the time-worn plea of self-defense is put
forward in extenuation of the tragedy. It
tells of robbery and argon â the destruction
of the victim's home that the flames
might incinerate his corpse and destroy
all evidence against his assassin. Thus
goes the confession of John Dodge, who
is now awaiting trial for taking Mudgett's
life.
Dodge and his wife, Ida Dodge, after
their arraignment at Usal, were broueht
to Ukiah and imprisoned. Deputy Sheriff
Hart, who escorted them, wired to Dis
trict Attorney Sturtevant, who was at
Fort Bragg, asking Stunevant to meet the
party at Wiilits. Sturtevant, after an all
night drive, arrived at Wiilits in time to
meet Hart and his prisoner. Dodge had
made a full confession to Hart on the road
and the latter desired that it be made
known to the District Attorney at once, t
On Saturday evening at Lanr-land's
hotel at Wiilits, in the presence of Deputy
Hart, District Attorney Sturtevant and
Superior Court Reporter William Held,
Dodge told of his complicity in the mur
der, and his confession was taken down by
Reporter Held.
Dodge stated that on Wednesday, Octo
ber 29, he had been out deer-hunting, and
while on his way home passed by
Mudgett's place. The latter asked what
he was doing in that vicinity. Dodge said
he -*as looking for some ho.-s he had left
iunning there. Mudgett then accused
him of having already killed the hogs, and
said he had no business running after
otber people's hogs. Dodge insider!, that
he could prove by his brother-in-law,
Rube Nobles, that he had never killed the
hogs; but Mudgett stated that Nobles
was such a notorious liar that he would
not believe him.
Dodge declares that Mudgett then re
ferred to a bull that he had owned, claim
ing that Dodge and Nobles had strangled
it to death. He said that Nobles had lied
In that instance. Mudgett then went on
to say that it would be better that Dodge
never attain cross the river (meaning the
South Fork of Eel River, which separatee
Dodce's place from Mudgett's). If he did
so he would be killed by some one.
Dodge says that Mudgett began to abuse
him. They were sitting opposite each
other in Mudgett's cabin. Mudgettraised
his arm in a threatening manner. Just
as be did so. Dodge, without taking aim,
fired one barrel of bis shotgun in Mud
gett's direction. Then ht> ran outside for
fear that Mudgett might shoot at nim in
the dark. Not .hearing the latter, here
turned to the cabin and found the rancher
lying on the floor breathing heavily and
evidently dying.
Dodge then took a rifle from Mudgett
and ran from there to his own home.
There he met his wife and related what
had transpired. They were living with
Dodge Sr. at ths time, and to divert sus
picion they retired to their room and
tbere planned meaos of hiding traces of
the crime. Finally they agreed to go to
Mudgelt's cabin and set fire to it, destroy
ing the body and toe contents of the
cabin. Both donned overalls, and wrap
ping their bare feet in grain sacks they
went to Mudzeti's cabin.
After arriving there Mudgett was found
outside the cabin, some fifty feet from the
building. They first cut a pocket out of
his pantaloons, in which he carried his
money, and which contained some $700.
Then they carried him into the cabin by
placing nim on two pickets and deposited
him on his bunk within. A can of coal
oil standing n<ar by was opened and the
contents poured on the body and the bed
ding. They retired to the door of the
building and from tbbre threw burning
wads of paper onto the body and when
the tire was well under way left for their
home.
Dodee.when he made the confession, Faid
thai he would have done so at Usal. but
thet his fear of being lynched prevented.
He gave as hi* reason for desiring to make
it before he got to Ukiah that he did not
want his wife to give the first, statement
of the case, and thereby have any bene
fit that might inure to her. To-day in
the county jail both Dodge and his wife
made another statement substantially con
forming to the first, with the exception
that Dodge said lie did not shoot Mudgett
until the latter had discharged his uun at
him, and ciaims that the buliet crazed
his neck. Mrs. Dodge states that trace of
the bullet was visible when Dodge re
turned to the house.
The generally prevailing opinion among
the officers is that Dodge shot Mudgett
outside of the cabin and carried his body
inside, and that Mndgett died instantly
afier being shot. Docile claims he stole
nothing but some money and some gun
lead, and says the provisions in the cabin
were burned. Dodge accuses Deputy
Constable Nelson, who was guarding the
prisoners, of having at Mrs. Dodge's re
quest relieved her of a large bowie-knife
with which the oilcan at Madgett's had
been opened, and which would have been
a strong factor in proving the guilt of the
Dodges. He also says that, although Nel
son was supposed to keep tne prisoners
separate so they might not communicate
with each other, he carried notes Detween
them.
It is probable that information for mur
der in the first degree will be Hied against
PRICE FIVE CENTS
Dodge, and possibly one for arson and
robbery. Against his wife tho charge will
in all probability be arson and accessory
to murder.
FIGHTING THE STEEL POOL.
Cleveland Companies Will Have to Go
Inio the Business Themselves in Or
der to Maintain Existence.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 16.â The new
agreement wbich has just been entered
into by the companies lorming the great
steel pool has practically driven those out
siders who have heretofore been custom
ers of the pool into a combination to ninu
facture their own steel, as the prioe
charged these rolling-mills for the product
is so high that they will either be forced
to shut down or do their own manufac
turing. It is therefore considered more
than likely the Cleveland companies will
soon put up mills of their ovn, as under
the change they are debarred from com
peting.
The new agreement wa3 entered into by
the companies Friday nieht at a meeting
at tne Manhattan Hotel, and differs
radically from the old. It takes in botn
billets and crude steel and the finished
product. The former contract only dealt
with crude material. In speaking of thia
agreement Charles Kerschoff, editor of the
Iron Age, said to-day:
''I regard the proposition to put up mills
by the Cleveland companies as more than
possible, but it is from force of sheer ne
cessity that they do so. They are prac
tically forced into a fisht lor their exist
e nee. The Lake Erie Iron Company is the
o De which started them, and I believe all
but one of the manufacturing concerns
have agreed to enter. The company will
put up another hearth plant. The Union
Rolling-mill will also stop buying billets of
the furnaces in the combination.
"This matter has been in the wind ever

but it was delayed bee ause it was not be
lieved the agreement would last long.
There were too many weak spots in iv
It has fallen apart as was expected, be
cause it was unjust to those who were in
the pool and who were perforce customers
of others in the pool because they did not
make their own product. This injustice
was that the allotment of production only
dealt with crude steel in the form of
billets. At the last meeting, however, the
agreement was so changed as to take in
tbe finished product only. Under the old
system rolling-mills which had a plant
capable of turning out finished stuff did
it so cheaply that it crowded out the fin
ished products of those who had no steel
plants. As the agreement exists at pres
ent everything is included except steel
rails, which are in a pool of their own/
SPUTE DROWNED HIS FAMILY
It Was Not an Accident That Caused tfia
Death of a Wife and Five
Children.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 16â Andrew J.
Spute. a well-known grocer of this city,
with his family, consisting of his wife and
live small children, went boating on
Smiths Lake Sunday, October 26.
The boat was capsized and Mrs. Spute
and the children were drowned. Spnte,
apparently with a great effort, managed
to cling to the boat until rescued.
Although it was known at the time of
the drowning that Mrs. Sprite's life, as
well as the lives of the children, were
insured for a sum aggreeating $12,000.
Spute's explanation of the cause of the
accident seemed satisfactory. Spute
claimed himself and family intended go
ing to the mountains for an outing, and
that the insurance for three monihs only
was taken out on this account.
Detectives have been quietly at work on
the case since the night of the drowning,
and it is alleged have secured evidence
that will convict Spute of the murder of
his family for the purpose of securing the
insurance on their lives.
Spnte was arrested at an early hour this
morning, and shortly after Nellie Davis,
an inmate of a well-known Market-street
resort, was lodged in jail. Spute, it is al
leged, has for a long time led
a dual life and has lavished much
money on the Davis woman,
whom he informed of the large insurance
on his wife's life and to whom he prom
ised costly presents on her birthday â the
18th of December. The woman is held as
a witness by the police and it is not be
lieved that she was acquainted with
Spute's plan for the murder of his family.
As Spute has always borne a good repu
tation, the facts developed in connection
with the drowning which were made pub
lic to-day have created a sensation amjong
hi 3 many friends.

KNOCKED OUT IN
THE SIXTH ROUND
Joe Choynski Goes Down
Before Peter Maher's
Rushes.
For Five Rounds the Men Fight
Cautiously and No Harm
Is Dene.
Then the Irishman Puts la a Right-
Hand Swing en the Jaw of
the Californian.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 16. -Peter
Maher knocked out Joe Choynski of Cali
fornia, with a right-hand swing on the
jaw after two minutes and twenty-Eve
seconds of the sixth round in their twenty
round contest before the Broadway Ath
letic Club to-night.
The men fought cautiously for five
rounds and Maher did not strike his usual
g.it until after the sixth round opened.
Then lie rushed at his man and Choynsfci
quickly went down before the hailstorm of
right and left swings that Peter ianded.
Joe got up staggering after having stayed
down nine second?. He made an effort to
steady himself, but it was of no avail.
Manor went rieht at him and with a clean
right-hand swine on the jaw sent him to
grass again. This time he lay flat on the
floor with arms and legs extended, and
the referee slowly counted him oul. The
Californian was not long in coming around
and after being helj)e<i to his corner, <oon
walked from the ring. The police clamber
ed into the ring under the charge of Acting
Captain Groo, but no arrests were made,
as boih men were uninjured.
This was the first heavy-weight boxing
contest of importance held in this city
under the new Horton bill, the terms
being a twenty-round encounter at catch
weights. Half an hour before tbe time
sÂ«;t lor starting there was a ten- round set
to between Patsy Haley of Buffalo and
Young Sislo of Providence.
The building, capable of seating 4500
peopie, was crowded from floor to ceiling.
A large delegation from Pittsburg, Boston
and Philadelphia had seats by the ring
side. There was great interest taken in
the Maher-Choynski contest, but little
money wag wagered. The consensus of
opinion was that the Irishman would
win, but Peter has had such an unpleasant
way of giving his backers the wrong end
of the money that they were rather chary
of chan cing any reverses.
ChoynsKi's reputation for gameness and
ability to take punishment, as well as his
proven shiftiness and cleverness, won him
many friends. Maher has shown an im
mense improvement in his late encoun
ters, has acquired confidence and is also
quick and shift}-. The easy manner in
which the Irishman polished off O'Don
nell and Slavin was fresh in the memory
of local followers of the sport.
Maher 3tated to the representative of
tbe United Associated Presses before the
opening bout that he never felt fitter for a
contest, whiie Choynski also declared him
self in fine fettle.
Tije opening oout was put on at 8:50.
Sara C. Austin was referee. Haley and
Sislo weighed in at 116 pounds. It was a
slogging match from ttie sound of the
bell. Sislo rustjed at his man and pushed
him to his knees. When Haley got up
they went at it hammer and tongs, both
landing sledgehammer blows.
In the second rouna both were wild, but
willing.. In the third the Buffalo boy
pasted his man hard with straight lefts on
the face. Sislo's nose bled freely and he
was very weary when the bell rang. Sislo
caure up early for the fourtn, but Patsy
easily avoided attack and punched his
mau all over tbe ring.- Sislo put a good
left in the face in the next, out Haley
made a regular chopping block of the
Italian, who was covered with blood at
the end, though still in the ring. Haley
payed with his man in the sixih, while
Sislo failed in heroic efforts to get within
striking distance. Haley hit his man
when and where he pleased in the seventh
and the referee put a stop to the battle
and gave Haley the decision.
There was scarce y a vacant seat in the
building when the ring was ready for the
appearance of tbe stars. The crowd had
been amused by a burlesque boxing bout
while Maher and JiioynsKi were putting
on the finishing touches in the dressing
rooms.
Maber was the first to appear at 9:47,
Choynski following a moment after. Both
men came in for a generous share of hand
clapping. Maher was seconded by Pete
Burns, Peter Lowry and Jack Quinn. In
Choynski's corner were Tommy West,
Paddy Gorman and Bob Armstrong.
Maher scaled 153 pounds and Choynski
168. Little money changed hands, but
Maher was a slight favorite.
Round Iâ They shook hands at 9:48. They
sparred for an opening. Maher led with a
light left on chest. More sparring. Choynski
feinted and shot a left that just reached the
wind. Manor put a hard left on the body and
they clinched. After a lot of clever feinting
on both sides Maher put a left hook on the
neck as Joe was turning round. The round
was mainly devoted to sparring at long range
Round 2â Maher missed a vicious right
swing and Joe put two lefts on the jaw. Maher
sent in a left to tlie neck. In trying to get
away Joe slipped and Peter shot tne right on
the body. Peitr put a hard left on the neck
and Joe got rattled. Joe then put three
stiaight lefts on the face and staggered Peter
with k left jab on tne jaw. Joe lauded left on
tne luce, but was countered with a right on
the chin. It was Choynski's round.
Round 3â Joe opened with a light left on the
body and repeated a moment later. Choynski
then sent the right to the face and Peter came
back with the left twice. Joe sent a Hard left
On the body. Peter rushed and Joe dropped to
his knee to avoid. Maher then wasted his man
twice with the right on the neck aud again on
the same place. Joe shot his left to the face
and Peter missed with the left, but lauded
lightly on the face as the bell rang.
Round 4â Joe came on with the left on the
body. Both were cautious. Finally Joe came
in again on the body with the left. MahÂ»r
Â»tuid on the defensive and Joe again put a left
on the boiy. Mailer got his man near the
ropes and sent in a hot right on the ribs. Joe
feinted with the left und then Maher swung at
his man, missing the right but landing the left
on the body and Joe clinched. Maher put a
left ou the neck an the bell raDg. They were
not sparring fast enough to suh the crowd
Round sâ Choynski was doing the loading
to far. He shoved a straight left In Peter's
face and easily avoided fne return. Maher
pasted a good left on the body, but Joe evened
up with a return. Maher led for the body and
brought his rlKht round on the neck. Chovn
fcki swung his left on tbe face and Mab> r
countered on tbe body. Peter nailed his man
on the face and they came closa together, both
doing pretty sparrlce and exchanging leits on
the face.
Round 6â Honors were about even. Joe led
wiui alelt f n the luw. Fierce infighting fol
lowed, and then Maiier floored his man with a
left hook on the jaw. Miiher rushea at ais
man and ianded right and left on the jaw,
flooring him aghin. Choynski got up on the
ninth count, only to be sent down again and
knocked clean out with a right cross on the
jaw. The police clambered into the ring, but
no arrests were made. The referee awarded
the decision to Maher. The round lasted 2
minutes 25 ' seconds.

An Incident of the Fi a ht Which Hap
pmed in CorbtU'x.
The sports of this City who gamble on
pnzÂ«-fighting contests thronged Corbett's
poolroom last evening to hear the returns
of the rounds of the much-talked-of fight
in New York, between Joe Ohoynski and
Teter Maher. The betting here lavored
the Californian at slight edds, but in the
East Maher sold a strong favorite, many
bets of 2 to 1 beinp laid on biro.
The general opinion of the men here
who are recognized as authorities ou prize
fighting was that Chovnski wouid win lit
five or six rounds, he being rated a much
more clever man than Maher and also a
heavy puncher. Tne account of the light,
according to the disnatches, stamped
Maher as beinc the haidest puncher.
Choynski bit the Irishman frequently
with both left and right, but his blows did
not, seemingly, have the desired effect.
The right goes to trove that Choynski
has lost his great hitting powers.
In bis great battles with Goddard he
cut deep gashes in the Australian's face
and frequently knocked him down.
If he possessed the same powerto-day
he would have knocked Maher down sev
eral tirnep before the sixth round. The
Californian baa gone back, ami there is
little prospect of his improvement, al
though he still retains his old time
cleverness.
Maher must have improved wonderfully
to whip Choynski in such order. In all
probability be will challenge the winner
of the Fitzsimmons and Shancey contest,
but if the former. should win, he will not
give any attention to the Irishman's defi,
as lie has whipped Maher twice already.
It is said that some of the sports here
made up a pool of $4000 and shipped the
coin East, with orders to have it placed on
Ctioynski at the prevailing odds of 2 to 1
on the Irishman. It is doubtful now if
any of tbe coin wi:l return.
"A rather strange thing happened at
Corbett's just about the time the first
round of ibe fight arrived.
When the rooms were crowded with
sports the police were called in .to dis
perse some of the mob, and a picture of
Choynski which was hanging on the wall
alongside several other pictures of pugil
ists fell to the floor. A big Irishman
named Ryan, who saw the photograph
drop, rushed into the pool-sellers' de
partment and placed $50 on Maher,
saying that lie never knew in
his life of a picture falling f -om a wall
that did not bring bad luck to the man or
woman it represented. A good many
superstitious people followed the advice
of Ryan to bet on Maher, and their joy
was great when the Irishman was pro
nounced by the reader of the returns a
winner.

JEWISH WOMEN'S COUNCIL
Reports Tell of the Good Work Done by the
Organization Throughout the
Union.
NEW YORK, H. V., Nov. 16.â The sec
ond day's session of the First Council of
Jewish Women was called to order at 10
a. m. to-day in Tuxedo Hall. Mrs. Hanna
G. Solomon, president of the council, pre
sided, and there was a large attendance of
delegates.
The first business transacted to-day was
the presentation of the report of the com
mittee on credentials. This showed that
there were forty-eight delegates and eight
alternates present at the convention.
The report of the recording secretary
was then read by Mrs. Gertrude G. Berg
of Philadelphia in the absence of Mrs. C.
M. Wolf of Chicago. It reviewed the his
tory of the council and showed that it was
the outgrowth of the women's congress at
the World's Fair. It stated that the two
| main committees are those of "religion"
and "philanthropy," the principal lin s of
work ot the council. _
The sections of the council which are
subdivided into circles are from four to
five hundred in membership, and many
have joined the Federation of Clubs in
such bta'es where a Federation o: Clubs
exists. The report also states that the
council had representatives at the Biennial
Council of Wcmen at Atlanta and also at
j the Elizabeth Cadv Stanton celebration.
The report of the corresponding secre
tary was received with applause and
adopted. As Bertha A. Selz of Chicago,
the treasurer, was unable to appear, the
report was read by Mrs. Conrad Wilkowaky
of the same city.
The next report was that of the comm't
teeon rules, which was read by the chair
man, Mrs. 8. R. Levy of Milwaukee. The
committee recommended that all dele
gates wear badges, and that the time of
discussion be limited to three miniites,
and that each delegate be entitled to one
vote. This was adopted.
Tbe next business was the reading of
the reports of the vice-presidents. At the
conclnsion of the reports of the vice-presi
dents a recess was taken. On reassem
bling Mrs. Nellie L. Miller of Memphis
delivered an nddress on "The Council, its
Advantages, Needs and Difficulties."
A general discussion on the subject fol
lowed. At the conclusion of the discus
sion an adjournment was taken until 8
o'clock. At the night session tbe reading
of the report of the National correspond
ing secretary.
The report showed that the council has
a membership of 4000 and that much
progress had been made in establishing
; sewing-schools, girls' clubs, kindergartens,
etc. The report also stated that 15,000
j copies ot seven pamphlets have been dis
i tributed through the secretary's office.
I Mrs. Rachael Sulzerberger of this city
then read a paper entitled "The Council
in Large Cities," and was followed by Mrs.
Etta 8. Numark of Marion, Ind., on "The
Council in Small Cities." After discus-
I sion the session adjourned until to
morrow.

ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 16.â Mrs. Chari
ton Enholm of New York conducted the
prayer-meetine of the W. C. T. U. con
vention this morning, while Mrs. Annie
M. Palmer, the National evangelist from
lowa, led the season of prayer when the
convention was called to order at 9
o'clock. The special order of the morn
ing was the reports of department super
intendents. Mr?. Katheriue Lente Ste
venson of Massachusetts presented the
report of the department of the press in
which she took somewhat radical ground
concerning the relation of the organiza
tion to the newspapers. . On this point she
said :
"We have not attempted to keep a rec
ord of the money value, at advertising
rates, of items furnished to the press, but
it can easily be seen that it would be an
enormous sum. Personally I dt> not like
to put our work for the press upon tne
basis of paid advertisement. I prefer to
think what the newspapers would pay for
the items we have furnished gratuitously,
if sent to them as is the majority of the
matter which fills their columns. You
will readily see that in such a case the
balance would be overwhelmingly on the
other side.
"It seems to me that it is upon just this
basis that our work should be cou idered.
It is true that we have received great
favors froui the press, but it is equally
true we have granted them favors in mak
ing it possible for the uapers to fill a con
stantly increasing demand on the part of
their readers. I believe this view of the
situation will be more and more realized,
and expect to see the day not very far dis
tant when this department will be self
supporting and when the majority of our
leading papers will appoint Women's
Christian Temperance Union editors. 1 '
Mrs. Sterenson went on to say: "No
other agency in the affairs of the people
so truly deserves to be called the power
behind tne throne as does the press.
Where the pulpit and lecture ball reach
hundreds and thousands weekly, the
papers and magazines reach millions
daily. The potent factor each printed
word may become in molding thought
ana influencing action we cannot over
estimate. Examples are coming to us
continually of legislative issues carried or
defeated, of lives turned into the channels
of nghteou-ness or unrighteousness, ac
cording to the print-rd word which was
suffered to influence individual or national
minds. These things being so, it becomes
a matter of the utmost importance that
the papers of our land should be made the
channels of purity rather than impurity;
righteousness rather than unrighteous
ness; truth rather than falsehood.
Twenty-one thousand two hundred and
twenty-five papers and magazines are pub
lished in our own country alone.
"If the trend of even the majority of
these was always and unequivocally to
ward the highest good, we should hasten
by mighty strides the inbringing of the
Kingdom of heaven, which is the kingpom
of righteousness. The Woman's Christian
Temperance Union at a very early period
of its existence recognized the importance
of securing this agency lor the promul
gation of ltt principles. From the very
iirst we have striven to establish a re
lationship ot mutual helpfulness and co
operation between the press and our own
organization.
"That this relationship has constantly
grown in strength and cordiality we are
continually assured. We are no longer
lorced to sue lor entrance to the columns
of the papers of the land, but they are
thrown wide open to us, and heartiest
words of appreciation are spoken concern
ing the value of the matter we bring."
At the afternoon session Mrs. Sophia
Grubb of Missouri, superintendent of the
work among foreigners reported that it
wa< progressing very favorably, although
influenced by tne general depression in
business. The seven National associates
had done effective work.
Mrs. M. B. Carse, president of the Pub
lishing Association, reported that ihe re
ceipts were $145,337 and the expenditures
$125,121. The receipts for 1896 were $14,4f0
Ips* than in 1895, but the net gain was
$516. The financial storm bad been
weathered by reducing expenses, the
volume of business being frnalier.
Mrs. Curse also submitted a report about
the temple. She had raised $141,398 of
the $300,000 needed to buy the trust bonds,
and would try to secure the balance this
year. The interest on the bonds hnd been
paid. The states subscribing over $1000
were: Illinois $4275, New York $2973,
Massachusetts $2581, Pennsylvania $-77^,
Ohio $2237, Michigan $1557. Connecticut
$1313, Maryland $1059. Missouri $1040.
WRIGHT ACT SUSTAINED.
Oontinued front Plrtt Page.
directly enjoy or participate in any improve
ment in order to constitute a public use.
All land-owners in a district have a right to
propoitionate share of water, and no one
land-owner is favored above his fellow In his
riÃht to use th<; water. It is not necessary in
order that the use should be public that every
resident in the district should have a right to
the use of water. The water is not used for
general, domestic or for drinking purposes,
and it is plain from the scheme of the act that
the water is intended for the use of those who
will have occasion to use it on their
lands. Nevertheless, if it should so happen
that at any particular time a land-owner
should have more water than he wanted to
use on his land he has a right to sell or assign
a surplus or the whole of the water as he may
choose.
Irrigation ii not so different from reclama
tion of swamps as to require application of
other and different principles to the case. The
fact that in draining swamp lands it is neces
sary to drain lands of all owners which are
similarly situated goes only to the extent of
peculiarity of the situation and kind of land.
Some of tha swamp lands may not be nearly
so wet and worthies* as some others, and yet
all may be so situated as to be benefited by
reclamation, and whether it is so situated or
no!, must be a question of fact. The same
reasoning applies to land which is to some ex
tent arid instead of wet. Indeed, the general
principle that arid lands may be provided
wiih water and cost thereof provided for by
general tax or by assessment for local
improvement upon lands benefited, seems
to be admitted by counsel for appellees.
This necessarily assumes the proposition that
water used for irrigation purposes upon lands
which are actually arid, is used for public pur
poses, and the tax to pay for it is collected for
a public use, and assessment upon lands bene
fited is also levied for a public purpose. Taking
all the facts into consideration as already
touched upon, we have no doubt that irriga
tion of really arid lnnds is a public purpose
and water thus used is put to public use.
The second objection urged by appellees
herein in that the operations of this act need
not be ana are not limited to arid, unproduc
tive lands, but include within its possibilities
all lands, no matter how fertile or productive,
so long as they are susceptible iv their natural
state of bue mode of irrigation irom a com
mon source, etc. The words "in their natural
stale ' are interpolated in the text of the stat
ute by counsel for appellees on the assump
tion that the Supreme Court of California has
thus construed the act In the Tregea case
(88 Cal., 334). The objections aad been maae
in that cas-j that it was unlawful to include
he city of Modesto in an irrigation district.
The court, per Chief Justice Beattv, said the
Legislature undoubtedly intended that cities
and towns should iv proper cases be iuclude.d
in irrigation districts, and that the act rs thus
construed did not violate the State constitu
tion.
What is the limit of power of the Legisla
ture in regard to providing for irrigation?
Is it bounded by the absolutely worthless con
dition of land without artificial irrigation? Is
it confined to land which cannot be made to
yield the smallest particle of return for labor
bestowed upon it? If not absolutely worthless
and incapable oi growing any valuable thing
without water, however valuable may the
land be and to what extent may it be
put before it reaches a point at which the
Legislature has no power to provide for its
improvement by that means? The general
power of the Legislature over the subject of
providing for irrigation of certain kinds of
lands must be admitted and assumed. The fur
ther questions of .imitation,, as above pro
pounded, are somewhat legislative in their
nature, although subject to the scrutiny and
judgment of courts to the extent tfcat it must
appear that the- use intended is publio use as
that expression has been denned relatively to
this kind of legislation.
Tne Legislature by this act has not itself
named any irrigation district, and of course
not decided as to the nature and quality of
any specific lands which have been included
inanysuch district. It has given a general
statement as to what conditions must exist in
order to permit inclusion of any land within
thedist-ict. The land which can properly be
so included is as we think sufficiently limited
in its character by the provisions of tne act.
It must be susceptible of one mode of irriga
tion from a common source by the same sys
tem of works.
We come now to the question of the true
construction of the act. Does it provide for a
hearing as to wnether the petitioners are of
tne class mentioned and described in the act
and as to their compliance with the con
ditions of the act in regard to the proceedings
prior to the presentation of the petition for
the formation of a district? Is there any
opportunity provided for a hearing upon
notice to land-owners interested in the ques
tion whether their lands wili be benefited by
proposed irrigation ? We think a right to a
hearing in regard to all these facts is given
by the act, and that it has been practically so
construed by the Supreme Court of California
in some of the cases above cited from reports
of that court and in cases cited in briefs of
counsel. We should come to the same con
clusion from a perusal of the act.
It is not an accurate construction of the
statute to say that no opportunity is afforded
to the land-owner to test the sufficiency of the
petition in regard to the 6igners thereof and
in regard to other conditions named in the
act, nor is it correct to say that the power of a
Board of Supervisors Is, in terms, limited to
making such changes in boundaries proposed
by petitioners as it rany deem proper, subject
to ti:e conditions named in the act
In the act under consideration the establish
ment of its boundaries and purposes, for which
a district is created, if it be finally organized
by reason of the approving vote of the people,
will almost necessarily be followed by and re
sult iv un assessment upon all lands included
within the boundaries of a district. The Legis
lature thus in substance provides for the crea
tion not alone of a public corporation, but of
taxing a distr:ct whose boundaries are fixed, !
not by the Legislature, but, after a hearing, by
the Board of Supervisors, subject to the final
approval br the people in an election called
for thÂ« pnvpose. It has been held in this court
til-it the Lcgis-lahire has power to fix such a
district for itself wiihout any h.nring as to
benelits for th ? purpose of assessing upon lands
within the district
The Legislature when it fixes a district itselt
is suppos> <1 to have made a proper inquiry
and to have finally and conclusivly determinea
the amount of benefits to the land included
in the district, and a citizen has no constitu
tional right to any other or further hearing
upon that question. The right which he
thereafter has is to a hearing upoa the ques
tion of what is tetmed an apportionment of
the tax i. c. : the am. unt of the tax which he
is to pny, but when as, in this case, a de
termination of tii: question of what lands
shnli be included in the district is only to be
decided after a decision as to what lands de
scribed in the petition will be.benefittcd, and
tbe decision of that question is submiled to
some tribunal, the parties whose lands are thus
included in the petition are entitled to a
hearing upon the question of benefits, and to
have the lands excluded if the judgment
of the board be against their being
benefited. Unless the Legislature decide the
question of benefits itself tbe land-owner has
a right to be heard upon that question before
his property can be taken.
After careful tcrutiuy of the objections to
the Wright act we are compelled to the con
clusion that none of such objections is well
taken. The judgment appealed from is there
for reversed, and the cause remanded to the
Circuit Court of the United States for the
Southern District of Calllornia for further pro
ceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
AUTHOR WRIGHT'S VIEWS.
Wisely Administered, the Law Will
B -> of Great Benefit.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., Nov. 16â C. C.
Wright, author of the Wright irrigation
act, gives The Call the following anent
the decision by the Supreme Court at
Washington to-aay:
"The constitutionality of the irrigation
district, law of California has at last been
decided. The Prcgea case reached the
United States Supreme Court on a writ of
error in April, 1892. A motion was im
mediately made to dismiss it on the
ground that no Federal question was in
volved. This motion was denied and the
judgment to day is simply a judgment of
dismissal on the identical ground of the
'motion made nearly five years ago.
"In the Fallbrook case Judge Ross' Je
cision has been reversed. The merits of
lhe controversy were gone into in this
ense and the constitutionality of the law
has been thoroughly settled. But this
decision has been rendered after almost
five years' delay, and the districts during
all this time nave been paralyzed. The
district law would have been an unquali
fied success from the start but for two
stumbling-blocks. The first of these was
the litigation constantly carried on, and
wnich until now has rendered the bonds
of irrigation disiricts of doubtful legal
validity. Capital was shy of them for
this reason alone. Because money could
not be raised with which to construct
works the districts could do nothing. In
several instances a few bonds were sold
early in the contest and interest was re
quired to be paid on these. The necessity
of this payment, without any benefit,
since the works could not be completed,
drove many who were at first warm snp
porters ol the law into the camp of those
who were anxious to have the law declared
invalid.
"The other stumbling block was the for
mation of districts where proper condi
tions did not exist. Speculators in some
instances lobbied unworthy projects
through boards of supervisors and se
cured the organization of districts where
the conditions were such as to absolutely
prevent the success of the district.
"The two essential conditions to the ex
istence of a successful district are: First,
irrigable land; and second, a sufficient
water supply. Where either of these is
wanting, success is impossible. If either
of these essentials be wanting the law
does not authorise a board of supervisors
to allow an organization to be perfected.
When an organization has been had hi
such a case it ought not be allowed to
stand if it can be avoided. Wisely admin
istered, the district lav/ affords a means of
supplying water to the consumer at the
bare necessary cost of getting it on his
land. Now that all legal difficulties are
out of the way, there is no reason why it
cannot be so administered."
CAUSES SATISFACTION.
Operation of the Law Will Boom
San Diego Districts.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 10.â The news
of the affirmation of the constitutionality
of the Wright act by the United States
Supreme Court wns received here to-day
with great satisfaction. The prediction
was made by all acquainted with the
situation that the decision marks a new
era of prosperity in the State, and es
pecially in San Diego County. In Linda
Vista district especially, the largest in
the State, there is every prospect of im
mediate development through the invest
ment of Eastern capital. The district is
authorized by vote of its members to issue
$1,000,000 in bonds, and a banker named
McLaugblin of lowa stands ready to take
the amount still to be issued, $840,000 and
build the system.
Escondido district, which has gone on
and developed water and built its system,
will now enter upon a new era of prosper
ity. Under the doubt existing, settlement
upon the lands was retarded, ai it was un
certain whether the district would own its
water system or whether it would be
turned over to H. W. Putnam, holder of
the bonds. The owners of the lands, too,
were waiting for the decision in oraer to
more fully develop their property and
make improvements which will now be
made. Eseondido has 12,000 acres of
superb land, practically all under water.
The water developed under the Wright
act costs less than $2 per year per acre, the
cheapest water in the State, so far as
known.
This decision also insures the legality of
the Jamnicba district, which is under the
water system of the Southern California
Water Company. It is expected that the
effect of the action of the Supreme Court
will be to hasten the completion of that
great system. If the district and the
company should continue the old con
tract, which is still in force, the water
from Cottonwood Creek will be flowing
upon the lands of the district before many
months. The Jamaicha district lies east
<i{ and adjacent to the city and contains
17,000 acres of choice lemon land.
Samuel F. Smith, attorney for the Fall
brook Irrigation District^ which was the
district in question before the Supreme
Court, said to-day that a local capitalist
stood'ready to buy the entire issue of Fall
brook district bonds us soon as tbe neces
sary steps were taken to issue them.
Judge George Fuller, president of the
Linda Vista District, says the decision is
the greatest single thinV for the benefit of
San Diego city and county that has ever
happened.
Farmers Are Jubilant.
COLUSA, Cal., Nov. 16.â There is joy
in tne laud to-night over the Wright act
decision. The news was received with
great gratification, and now all hope the
great canal on which so many hundreds
oi thousands have b^en expended will be
completed. For four years the great ma
chinery has stood idle on the plains and
the night; dred.-ing apoaratua owned by
the San Francisco Bridge Company has
been use. ess. The farmers along the
canal, with few exceptions, are jubilant.
The bonds that were sold will advance
and the valley lands will increase in value
and mortgages will be lifted.
In Riverside Districts.
RIVERSIDE. Cal., Nov. 16.â The news
of the decision was received with great
regret by the settlers of the Perris and
Alessandro district, and an immediate
effort will be made to secure the cancella
tion of the bonds of these districts. The
decision is satisfactory to Easi Riverside
and Pieasant Valley districts.
WILL BENEFIT THE STATE.
The Decision Means an Increased
Investment in California.
The decision of the "United States Su
preme Court holding the Wright irriga
tion law of California to be constitutional
created no end of comment in San Fran
cisco yesterday. The general opinion was
expressed by bankers and business men
that the effect of the decision would be to
establish abroad a larger decree of confi
dence in California investments and to en
courage capitalists to invest their money
in this State.
Daniel Meyer, banker and capitalist,
said last evening: "The irrigation bonds
issued by the various districts under the
provisions of the Wright law are held in
this State and Europe. Many of the bonds
were bought by residents of foreign coun
tries. The effect of the decision will De
beneficial to California. It will stimulate
investments in this State ami re-establish
confidence abroad. It is a just decision
i hut is sure to promote the agricultural
development of California."
Inquiries addressed to other bankers
elicited the opinion that the irrigation dis
tricts bonds were generally held in Europe
and the Eastern States of this country.
The Swiss were large investors. It was said
that the holdings by Sail Francisco banks
was very slight. The Anglo-Californian
Bank was thought to be the agent for a
large number of foreign investors. Borel
& Co. were agents also for bondholders re
siding abroad.
Tne gossip or chitchat of capitalists
credited ex-Judge Jumes A. Waymire and
General Thomas J. Clunie with great good
fortune as the result of ti.e decision.
Judge Waym're was highly elated. It is
known that ex-President Harrison was iu
duoed by his high regard personally for
Judge Waymire to make the argument in
the United States Supreme Court for a fee
which would not have been regarded as
liberal compensation for a lawyer of or
dinary attainments.
It is tne talk that General Glunie is the
holder oi $30,000 of irrigation bonds and
that his wealth is considerably enhanced
by the decision. The raise comes in handy
as Clunie has paid several liberal wagers
that Bryan would be elected. The court
which Bryan denounced has surely pro
claimed one decision which puts the elo
quent Thomas J. on velvet.
Â£. B. Pond, capitalist, while admitting
that the decision is fortunate for the bond
holders, regards it as very unfortunate for
the people living in the irrigation districts
of the State. When asked "Why," he
said: "Because it permits taxation with.
out representation. In some districtsHl
tax amounts to confiscation of the land.
In several instances land has been taxed $60
an acre. Cliques of men get together, or
ganize the districts and recklessly squan
der money in the construction of works.
The dam of the Modesto district, which
cost $500,000, should not have cost more
than $250,000. People are taxed for water
whether they use it or not. Ido not know
that the law can be amended to correct
the injustice. It ought to be repealed by
the Legislature.''

WEYLER WILL FAIL
Defeat of the Brutal Leader
to Terminate the
* War.
In That Event Spain Will Try
to Precipitate a Conflict With
This Country.
Carlists May Overthrow the Present
Government and Place Don Carlos
en the Throne.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 16.â The Cu
bans in this city are preatly excited over
the campaign winch (ieneral Weyler is
waging against Genera! Maceo, and all
think that a crisis in the revolution has
arrived, and that should General Weyler
suff?r defeat and be compelled to return
to Havana the war would be soon termi
nated.
About the probability of war between
Spain and the United States Senor Julie
de Castro of the Cuban revolutionary
p.irty saul to-day to a reporter of the
;ited Associated Presses:
w 'I believe that Spain will try to precipi
tate a war with this country, because her
own Government at home is threatened.
â If .Spain loses Cuba without the interven
tion 01 the United States it is certain that
the Carlists in Spain wiil rise, and as they
iiymber about 2,000,000 the result will be
the overthrow of the present Government
â¢ 'ond the accession to the throne of Don
Carles, who is now in Paris waiting for
just such a move.
'iThe Spanish officials," said Senor de
Castro, "realize this danger, and the
. 'only way out of the difficulty is to en
â  gape in a war with this country, which
.will give them an excuse for losing the
island, as they surely mu?t in such a
war."

JUtUTAI.ITY O F THE SPANISH.
â¢ llarih Treatment of Ship\ereeJced Seamen j
. * 'Mho I Âââ !d on the Cmban (suit.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 16.â Among
the passengers who arrived to-day per the
t Ward line steamer Yucatan from Havana
/ were thirteen shipwrecked seamen. They
â¢ were Captain Nelson and twelve of the
' .crew of the British steamer Coila. which
. ran ashore on Colorado Reef at 3 o'clock
â¢ on tne morning of November 2. Later
tbe steamer got off into deep water and
Captain Nelson attempted to run her
across the strait to Key "West, but the
'â¢water gained so rapidly that at 5 A. M.
they abandoned the steamer, which shortly
afterward sank in deep water.'
, At 7a. m. the shipwrecked seamen landed
on the Cuban coast, about sixty miles
west of Havana, where they fell into the
elands of the Spanish soldiers. The Span
iard.-, believing . them to De lilibusters
from the American coast, treated the
prisoners harshly, threatening to shoot
â¢ atl hands, and finally they were taken to
.Havana, where they were taken in charge
by the British Consul, who sent them to
New York.
Henry W. Delorey, one of the ship
wrecked crew, in speaking of their ex
perience in Cuba, said:
"We landed about sixty miles west of
Havana and were taken in charge by a
â¢troop of soldiers, who escorted us to a
sugar* estate. Here they used us very
â¢kindly, but they had strong suspicion that
we were American filibuster.--. Late in the
day another troop of soldiers took us to
Marian, where they insisted tbat I could
speak Spanish. I was taken to the head
quarters and questioned by a big Spaniard,
who asked if we were English or Ameri
can. I answered English. 'No, Ameri
can.' said he, striking me over the head
with a loaded cane and stunning me. The
blood ran down my neck and I felt weak,
and as the soldiers pointed their guns at
me I expected to be shot. Failing to find
k Americans among our crew 1 was dis
|^ missed. We were compelled to sleep on
tne bare stone floor with soldiers on guard.
We were then sent to Havana, whsre we
were cared for by the liritish Consul. If
we had been Americans we would never
have lived to tell the tale."
The Coila was a vessel ol 1162 tons, built
at Ayer, S otland, if) 1884. *
SAYS WAS IS POSSIBLE
Spaninh Ittinistrr de Lome Speak* of the
tierio't* mutation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 16.â A Wash
ington dispatch says: Senor Dupuy de
Lome, the Spanish Minister, was asked
to-day the direct question: "Do you be
lieve there is any danger of a war between
the United States and Spain?"
"It is possible," the Minister answered.
"It would be a terrible one. One can fore
see its beginning, but not its end."
This remark of the Spanish Minister,
made in ail seriousness Dy a diplomat in
his standinp. is remarkable. It admits
tbe tension in the relations of the twocoun
trics and shows that the spirit of desperate
bravado that would push Spain to war
with the United States is not confined to
tde Spanish common people, but even
affects those high in authority who are
better acquainted with lais country's re
sources and power.
Senor de Lome is far more inclined to
believe war possible than is generally sup
posed In diplomatic circles.
Spain's Minister has not so much confi
dence in the next President or tbe next Sec
retary of State. It is feared at the Spanish
hÂ«uioa that a desire for popularity may
move the new administration to actively
aid insurgents, in which case the Spanish
pride -will rebel and trouble may re
sult. An official communication from
Spain's political agent at St. Peters
burg informs the Spanish Min
ister that the recently published
report that in a war between the Untied
States and Spain Russia would be favor
able to the United States is not true. The
communication alleges that the Russian
Government has assured Spain that it will
preserve an absolute neutrality to a cer
tain point.
From this it is argued at the legation
here that as a war with Spain would be
based on the interference of a
foreign power in her inalienable
right to bold her territorial posses
sions, the United States need not
expect sympathy from Russia or any
other European nation. France, having
recently acquired colonies, would bitterly
resent, it is thought at the legation, any
country's effort to aid Cuban indepen
dence.
Russia likewise has immonse interests
at stake, besides having a treaty of alli
ance with France. The Spanish Minister
believes the revolt of Cuba is the begin
ning of trouble with all of the
West India islands and tbat England
and Holland are watching their colonies

SOUTHERN PROTECTION
Forts That Require Considerable
'â  Strengthening Without Delay.
NEW ORLEANS, La., JS'6v. 10.âSev
eral weeks ago Major J. B. Quinn, United
States engineer, recognizing the compara
tively defenseless position of this city
against a foreign foe, evolved an elaborate
plan for the building of a series of forts
twelve miles below the city at what is
called English Turn.
The plans of Major Quinn take into con
sideration the expenditure of $50,000,000
and the establishment of the forts would
occupy fully three years. The- importance
of the suggestions was recognized by the
United States authorities having in
charge work of erecting the f fortifica
tions aloiiT the gulf coast, and this morn
ing the Board of Fortifications, consisting
of Colonel H. M. Robert, the chairman of
the boarJ ; Colonel J. J. Barlow, attached
| for. the special duty, and 'Colonel L2O L.
i Gillespie, proceeded down the* river to
make the necessary examinations in con
nection with the project put forward by
I Major Qninn.
Fort Phillip and Fort Jackson are at
present the only protection to this city.
The Government has recently made many
improvements at these forts and equipped
them with two large guns each.
NOT A CA SE OF SUICIDE.
Mrs. Alma Vcrr.'d Accidentally Tools an
Orerdoie of J^aurfanttm.
LONDON. Eno, Nov. 10.â Mrs. Alma
Merritt, wife of George Merritt of New
York, died here Saturday night under
circumstances that fir^t lett to the belief
that she liad committed suicide. Mr.
and Mr?. Merritt were stopping at the
Hotel Cecil on the embankment. Saturday
evening Mrs. Merritt was found in a
comatose condition in her bedroom. By
the bedside were found two empty bottles
that had contained laudanum. Physicians
were summoned with all possible speed
and they did everything that could be
done to restore the woman to conscious
ness, but their efforts were in vain and
she died in a short time. Mr. Merritt
was present when bis wife died. The
coroner was notified and the body was re
moved to the Parish Mortuary. A post
mortem examination which was held here
to-day revealed the fact that death waÂ«
caused by laudanum. It Â«eemÂ« from all
that can be learned that Mrs. Merritt had
for some time oeen a sufferer from neu
ralgia and had been in the habit of taking
laudanum to relieve the pain. It is sup
posed that she accidentally took an over
dose of the drug.

BANDIT BORONDA
DIES FIGHTING
The Lower California Des
perado Killed by a
Rurale.
Battle to the Death Fought in a
Canyon Stronghold on the
Peninsula.
The Outlaw ani a Pursuer Meet in a
Desperate Hand-to-Hand
Conflict.
SAN DIEGO, Cat... Nov. 16.â Gnaualupe
Boronda, cattle-thief and outlaw, who
terrorized the sparsely settled country
back of Ensonada for a number of years,
has been laid away with a rnrale's bullet
through his head. But Boronda fought
hard, and the battle between him on one
side and Kurale Jesus Escobar and Justice
of the Peace Simon Contreras ov. the other
will be remembered as one of the most ex
citing in the annals of the peninsula.
So great has been the thievery of cattle
in the pastoral country below the line that
a peculiar law was enacted by the Anunta
miento of Ensenada to stop it. This law
was, in brief, that nc man should kilf a
cow or calf without first giving notice to
the nearest Justice of the Peace, who was
then to go and personally witness the
killing, or send a deputy, the object being
to officially inspect the brand and see
that the butcher had not killed the wrong
animal.
Boronda, the outlaw, scoffed at this
quaint Spanish law, and kept up his pre
datory habits, visiting the corrals or
ranges of the cattlemen and picking out
the best steers and heifers for his own use
or profit. He made his headquarters in
the inaccessible country beyond Santa
Clara Valley* where he kept a stiarp look
out for pursuers, and is said to have made
away with Vicente Ramos, a lancher,
who followed the tracks of his stolen steers
to his own death. Nothing was ever heard
of ltamos, and men who followed his trail
s>aid it led to the little canyon which
Boronda made his stronghold. They did
not follow the tracks further, as boronda
had a habit of lying in a nest of rock?,
which afforded a* birdseye view of the ap
proach for several miles.
On Sunday nii^lit. November 8, Boronda
was seen skulking on Augnstin Josea's
ranch. The next nay the best calf in the
bunch was misled, and Josea determined
to follow up the thief. He hunted up
Judge Contreras and told him of the theft
and infraction of the law. The Judge said
lie did not care anything for the theft, as
Josea was understood to be able to look
out for himself, but as for the infraction
of the lawâ well, lie was determinei to
hunt the criminal down. The Justice
sent for his best rurale, Jesus Escobar, a
dead shot, and together the three men
took the tra'l.
They were armed with Winchester', and
Escobar rode ahead. It was on Monday
afternoon when the men arrived near the
little canyon where Boronda held out.
They followed the trail easily, discerning
the tracks of the missing calf. Escobar
pot off his horsa when near enough to
make the hunt interesting, and askod the
others to stay back. They followed him
at a distance. E-oobar crawled through
the brush over the crest of the conyon.
Just as his head appeared against the
horizon there was a shot from below and
the rurale's head dropped. But he was not
killed. He lay like a snake watching nis
chance. When a few moments bad passed
and he failed to stir, a head was cautiously
lifted from behind a rock 200 feet ahead anil
quick as a flash the rurale's rifle sounded.
Boronda was too quick lor him, and
had dodced back when he saw the rnrale's
arm raised to tire. The two men. having
located each other, kept up a brisk lire,
both emptying their magazines and keep
ing them refilled. Escobar, who is famous
for his daiiujr, edged constantly closer to
his ndversary, keeping in the shelter of
bowlders. The Justice and Josea followed
and appeared over the brow of the hill,
but a shot from Boronda's ready riila split
the bone in tho rancher's arm and he re
tired.
Contreras made a dfitonr and found a
position where he could rake the rear of
the outlaw's rrtreat. Buronda rralizcd
instantly tliat the game was up. lie fired
a shot at the Judsrfe to temporarily rattle
him, and then, with a curse, sprang out
from behind t c rock and rushed toward
the rurale, who was sprawled behind a
small bowlder not thirty leet distant. In
two bounds Boronda was upon the aston
ished ruralp, who had his rifle at his
shoulder. Both men fired at the same in
stant, but the excitement of the charge
sent their bullets astray.
Boronrta landed squarely upon Escobar,
and they clinched. Escobar had a second
to grasp his revolver, while the ontlaw
was trying to pet at his knife. Judue
Contreras dared not shoot, aÂ« the com
batants were roiling over and over, cursing
iind striking at each other. Escobar
managed to get his right arm free and
with lightning-like quickness raised the
revolver and fired. The outlaw's brain
was pierced and he fell over without a
word. Throwing him from his arms Ru
rale Escobur Jell exhausted, while the
judge and Rancher Josea came up.
The outlaw was buried where he fell,
and a bowlder rolled upon his grave. The
Justice took oflicial note of the proceed
ings on the ami reported them te
his superior at Ensenada. The men went
to I Boronda's camp and there found v lot
of stolen cattle grazing on the rich bot
toms and a lot of plunder in the outlaw's
house. The cabin was an arsenal of
weapons.
Among the rifles on the wall was the
one taken by Ritneher Vicente Kamos in
liis search for the outlaw, and for the first
time the rancher's fate was definitely
known. He had been laid low hj* Boronda,
his body robbed and thrown to the
coyotes. __________^__
MONEY FOR MISSIONARY WORK.
Seme Liberal Appropriations Made by the
Genera/ Committee of the Method, st
Episcopar Church.
DETROIT, Mien , Nov. IG.â The gen
eral missionary committee of the M. E.
Church continued its work of apportion
ment of appropriations for home missions
this morning with the following result:
Northwest Pacific Coast conferences, in
cluding Scandinavian missions, $3r>,700;
Norwegian and Danish mission?, East,
West and Northwest. $19,800; French
missions in the United States, $4024;
Spanish missions in New Mexico, $r_',7so,
including $1750 for Spanish mission
schools; Chinese missions on the Pacific
Coast and in New York City, $.9615 ;
Bohemian and Hungarian missions, .Balti
more, Pittsburg. lowa and East Ohio,
$8410; Japanese missions in California,
$0500. and in Hawaii $1500.
In the discussion of the work in Hawaii,
the annexation of that country was
touched on, several bishops favoring it.
B shop Hurst, however, claimed that an
nexation would hi a grave mistake, and
declared that the people of the United
States would vote it down if submitted to
them.
The entire afternoon session was taken
op in discussion of South American mis
sions. Anderson Fowler of New York
and the Building and Transit Fund So
ciety haa also invested $50,000 in schools
and property in Chile, which had in
creased in value to $200,000. which had
been presented to the missionary commit
tee in ib'Ji on the condition that the com
mittee continue the self-supporting mis
sions in Chile. These missions, however,
had not been self-supporting, and the
special committee appointed to consider
Jhe question made two reports. The ma
jority favored the purchase of the prop
erty at its first value, $100,C00. while the
minority favored the return of it to An
derson and the fund of the society. The
majority report prevailed, and $.5000 was
appropriated to make the iirst payment
and continue the work.
HOBART' S LATEST PURCHASE.
Secures Prize- Winners at New York Which
W.I/ Be Exhibited at the Horse
Show Here.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 16.â John S.
Bratton, the Chicago horseman who cre
ated a stir at the horse show last week by
his daring driving of a four-in-hand team,
to-day sold to Waiter P. Hobart of San
Francisco the prize-winning carriage pair,
the Czar and the Sultan, for $4000.
The horses won lirst prize as a pair
.in one of the important harness classes of
the horse show, and the Czar in single
was second to Harry Hamlin's champion
stepper, Cogent, in another class.
Like nearly all of the crack
high steppers of the recent show
the Czar is a well-bred trotter, being by
Jerome Turner (2:loJi) from a daughter
ot Messenger Wilkes, the sire of Joseph C.
Wideous, champion high-stepper. He is
a bay gelding, 15.3 hands in height, and is
a typical high-class coach-horse.
Hobart, who purchased the Czar and
the Sultan, now owns one of the best col
lection of harness horses in this country.
About two years ago he purchased from
George B. Hulm the widely known
tandem tarn Superba and Mayday,
and from C. F. Bates tbe equally
noted tandem Cadet and Contribute,
payint something like $10,000 for tbe four
horses, according to the report, hhortly
after the close of the National hone
show in 1895, he bought from Mr.
Bates for a long price the prize-win
ning four-in-hand team, Acrobat and Ath
lete and Autocrot and Aristocrat. Mon
arch and Performer, the champion car
riage pair of last year's horse show, were
added to the Hobart stable a few week's
ago, the young California horseman hav
ing purchased the team from J. F. Tal
mage of Brooklyn in time to enter them at
this year's exhibition.
It is said that all of the stars of his col
lection will be shown at the San Francisco
horse show next month. Mr. Hobart is an
all-round horseman, owning a string of
thoroughbreds which includes Bright
PJiosbna and Ferrier and a stable of
trotters made up of Hazel Wilkes (2:11),
She (2:14%), Tuma (2:18)Â£) and a number
of otuer fast ones.
DEBATED IN THE REICHSTAG.
Interpellation of the Centrists Turns Out
to Be a Rather Tame
Affair.
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. IG.â The an-
nouncement made last week tnat within
the order of to-day's proceedings in the
Reichstag the Centrists would offer an in
terpellation demanding an explanation
on the part of the Government
of the neutrally treaty between
Russia and Germany, the exis
tence of which, from 1884 to
1890, was disclosed by Prince Bismarck
in tbe recent series of articles in
spired by the ex - Chancellor which
appeared in the Hamburg Nachrichten,
caused the galleries or the Reichstag to
be packed with people to-<lay. There was
also an unusually large attendance ol
members in the Chamber.
Shortly after the opening of the ses
sion Count yon Hompesch, Deputy for
Aachen and one of the recognized lead
ers of the Centrist party in the
Chamber, introduced the promised
interpellation. In the course of his re
marks Count yon Hompesch said that
the party of the Centrists decided to
move the distrust which has been
caused by the recent disclosures
of the existence of a treaty of
neutrality between Russia and Germany
during the period extending from 1834 to
1890. a distrust which was being felt
throughout wide circles at home and
abroad.
Prince Hohenlohe in reply said that
he was not able to give any in
formation concerning the Russo-
German neutrality, because that agree
ment had Been contractd in abso
lute secrecy, therefore Germany would
be unable to raise a one-sided argument
in regard to the convention or make any
explanation of the agreement. Still,
he said, he could solemnly allirm thnt
never at any time was the policy of Ger
many under English influence. Con
tinuing, the Chancellor said he believed
that the clouds of distrust which arose
among the people of Germany's allies
when the revelations were commenced
had already been dispelled, and he was
certain that full confidence existed be
tween Germany and Austria and Italy.
Freiherr Marschall yon Bieberstein,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, was the
next speaker. His remarks, which occu
pied forty minutes, were delivered in a tone
hardly audible to the members. He asked
the house to desist from exciting
further trouble over the matter, which had
already had the effect of causing great
perturbation throughout the country, and
rebutted the charge that Germany was
ready to break solemnly contracted treat
ies entered into by her with the other
powers.
The debate was a tame affair in com
parison with what was expected by the
opponents of the Government and fell far
short of being sensational.
As a matter of fact, after the speeches of
Count yon Hompescb, the replies of Prince
Hohenlohe and Baron yon Marschall yon
Bieberstein and the remarks of Count yon
Mitbach and Herr yon Kardorff the dis
cussion flattened out completely.
Count Herbert Bismarck stated that he
had remained silent during the debate
because the declaration of the Chancellor,
Prince Hohenlohe, had supplied him
with no basis upon which to discuss facts,
and he was not going to deal with
hypothesis. He would, therefore, confine
himself solely to denying that the
iuterview upon the revelations of the
Hamburger Nachrichten. published in
Vienna, and supposed to have been fur
nished by him, emanated from him, or
that he knew anything about it.

WRECKED NEAR
CARMANAH LIGHT
American Schooner Puritan
Strikes Shore During
a Fcg.
Captain acd Crew Rescued With
the Aid of Two Indians
en Land.
Reached by a Lifeline After Passing
Ten Hcurs in the Wave-
Washed Rigging.
VICTORIA, 8.C.. Nov. 25.â The Amer
ican four- masted schooner Puritan is the
latest addition to the long list of ship
wrecks which have made the rugged shore
of the west coast of Vancouver Island a
terror to seamen. The vessel is a com
plete wreck near the spot where, some
eleven months ago, the ship Janet Cowan
went ashore. Happily this latest disaster
is unattended by loss of life. Captain C.
11. Atwood and his crew of nine men, after
spending some ten hours on the wreck,
with the waves dashing over them, re
ceived assistance from two Indians and
. succeeded in petting to shore.
As soon as the Puriian struck huge seas
began to wash over her and carried away
the only two boats and everything on
deck. The men lasbed themselves to tbe
rigging and watched, between seas, for an
opportunity to float a line ashore. Their
efforts to secure a rope connection with
the shore" proved unsuccessful, the dis
tance being too great and the undertow
too strong. About an hour after the
schooner struck the fog lifted, showing
Carmunah light. *
About 8 o'clock two Indians on the
beach, waiting for low tide, succeeded in
getting onto a ledge of rocK near the ves
sel. They threw a fishline, weighted with
a stone, far enough for those on board to
secure It by another line with a hook at
tached. Then a three-inch hawser was
stretched between the ship and the rocks.
One end was made fast by the Indians
around a point of rock and the otner was
fixed through a block twenty feet up the
jigger rigging. By this rope all hands
succeeded in reaching the rock ten hours
after the schooner struck, the captain
being the last to leave tbe vessel. They
waded through the breakers to gain the
beach.
The Indians treated the wrecked men
hospitably, giving them something to eat
and a place to sleep. The seamen saved
nothing but what they wore. Some of
them were but scantily ciad at the time,
and others did not have even their shoes
on and their feet were painfully lacerated
Dy sharp rocks in walking from the end of
the line to the shore. The walk from
Bonilla to Carmanah was also a trying
one for those who were unfortunate
enough to be without covering for their
feet, as the country is of the roughest de
scription.
Too much praise cannot be given to the
two Indians who for nearly two hours
stood on the rocks, la the ice cold water,
endeavoring to throw a line within reach
of the shipwrecked sailors. By an almost
superhuman effort one of the Indians
threw the fishing-line, weighted with a
stone, nearly 150 feet, and thus the con
nection was made with the shore. Had
not the Indians bravely stuck to their un
comfortable post tbe lives of the men
aboard would have been lost.
The Puritan was a four-masied wooden
schooner, of a little over GOO tons register,
forty feet beam and twelve feet depth, of
hold. She was built at Port Madison some
six years ago and was in the coasting
trade. Her managing owners are C. A.
Hooper <fc Co. of San Francisco. She was
chartered to load a cargo of lumber at
Port Gamble for San Francisco. Her in
surance is not known.
Captain Atwood and crew will probably
leave for San Francisco on the first outgo
ing steamer.
IS WITH A BAD LOT
Vistnissal of a Charge of Zlurder
Aaainnt a Child Wife.
DALLAS, Ga., Nov. 16.â The child wife
of young Henry Jarman. himself only 17
years old, was acquitted here Saturday
evening of the charge of murder. Al
though Mrs. Sallie Jarman has been mar
ried nearly a year she is only a few
months past 14 years of age. She is pretty
and refined and several stations above the
youngster with whom she eloneel against
the wishes of her parents. But young
Jarman, who was a handsome young fel
low, was known as a daring younesterand
he won her.
They had been married only a couple of
weeks when the wife was arrested, charged
with having poisoned the family of her
husband, for whom she tidd been forced
to cook after her marriage with Jarman.
All the members of the family recovered
except the youngest child. A post mor
tem examination revealed no trace of
arsenical poisoning, but sentiment was so
strong against the young girl, who was
disliked because she was superior to those
in the Jarman neighborhood, tuat a trial
was forced.
Some of the theories advanced by the
defense were that the death was caused by
the acid from vinegar cooked in a tin pan",
or that the poison kept by Luke Jarman,
a brother of the girl's husband, to put in
his blockade whisky to make it bead, ac
cidentally got in the coffee. Henry Jar
man is now under arrest, charged with
dealing in moonshine whisky.
GRAIN FOR CORK.
negotiations Are Under Hay to Charter
a Steamer.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 16.â 1t was
learned to-day that negotiations are under
way for the charter of a steamer to load at
this port with grain for Cork for orders,
with the privilege of "Bombay direct."
The Bombay rate is said to be fixed at
8 shillings a quarter. The shippers are
believed to have prepared for this cargo by
purchasing 80,000 bushels of corn anil
50,000 bushels of mixed oats. It is also
reported that 24,000 bushels of No. 1 hard
Duluth wheat for prompt shipment to
Australia has been purchased, and that a
cargo of flour is under negotiation to be
snipped to tho same market. These char
ters and pnjehases are taken as a confirma
tion of the famine reports in India and
the short crop in Australia.
Fly in a Xete l'ork Depot.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. IG.â A ftre
early this morning gutted the room in

The fire is believed to have originated
from a spark from the electric wire. The
damage to the depot is $500. Loss on the
packages, however, may prove very ex
tensive, as the value of the contents can
only be told by the owners, who live in
various parts ol the country.

storms of the past week have played
havoc with transportation and telepraph
lines, both on mainland and tbe island of
Vancouver. Wires have been prostrated
for miles, they being coated with ice to
the size of a man's arm in places, and the
poles so completely encased in ice as to
look iike solid glass supports. At other
points snow from the hillsides filled tbe
air, burying wires and poles out of sight
and making it necessary for the repair
ga:i? to dig trenches along tne line to un
cover them.
The K-quimalt and Nanaimo Railroad

Rough Roads.
PORTLAND, Ob., Nov. 10.â A stace
ride of 545 miles over rough mountain
roads with thirty-six No. 4 shot plante d in
different parts of one's body is in
experier.ee lifcely to be avoided,
yet this is what was endured
by Albert Wilson, the captured
robber who on Saturday last was -hot in
the hold-up of tbe Paisley Postoffice in
Lake County. Wilson had a companion,
who, though wour.ded, managed to reach
his horse and escape. The prisoner also
reached the timber and dragged himself
to a camp which the robbers had occupied
while awniting tbe proper time for the
holdup. Here he was found by Deputy
l"ni:ed States Marshal Wharton, who had
trailed him by blood tracks.
Wilson was' very weak, both from loss of
blood and fever incident to numerous
wounds. He had received the contents of
both barrels of a shotgun at short range.
He made no resistance, even willingly ac
companying the officer into Paisley.
After lour days of surgical attendance
at that place the journey of 545 miles by
stage and rail to bring the man to
prison was begun. Wilson was placed
on a stretcher and the stage so ar
ranged as to allow the wounded prisoner
to lie at full length. Many of the sh#t
Had taken effect in "Wilson's face, and
during the journey the officer was
called upon to act as a surgeon and
extract a number of leaden pellets
which, having struck the robber's, frontal
bone, had not penetrated deeply. On ar
riving in Portland Wilson was at once
tafeen to the County Jail, where he will be
under a surgeon's care untii able to ap
pear in court for arraignment.

Whereabouts of Real Estate
Agent Walthall a
Mystery.
Accused of Having Appropriated
Money Paid for Others'
Property.
Believed to Have E:cap d on a
Bicycle While Officers Watched
tbe Trains.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 16. â After en
tangling himself in a web of crooked
transactions, J. \V. Walthall left this city
suddenly last Friday evening ana his
present whereabouts is unknown. For
some time Walthall had been trying to
explain away suspicious circumstances
surrounding a number of business trans
actions, and while he was hard pressed
for an immediate settlement of one matter
he dropped out of sight completely. His
downfall is due to gambling.
No criminal proceedings had been be*
gun against Waltball, but they had been
threatened, in the hope that he would
thereby be frightened into matting a set
tlement with persons whom he had swin
dled out of considerable sums of money.
His principal crookedness, and the matter
that was being pushed against him the
most persistently, was his action as agent
of the W. H. Ware estate. This fine
property is situated on the San Jose and
Los Gaios road, near Campbell. Some
time ago the tract was subdivided and a
number of lots sold. J. Robbins, who
lives in Connecticut, is the trustee for tne
estate and Walthall was the local agent.
The lots were sold on contracts, notes be
inn given, payable at interva.s.
Aa soou as all the notes were paid it was
expected that the detds would be forth
coming, but such was not the case. When
Walthall was appealed to in regard to the
matter he stated that he had forwarded
the money in payment for the land to
KobLins, but he had failed to rend on the
deeds. He al~o managed to put off a set
tlement from week to week and month to
month by saving that he could not hear
from Koboins; that the latter would not
answer his letters.
Among the injured persons were F.
Smith, who had paid to Walthall $1000,
and John Hanger, who had paid $700.
District Attorney Herrington was con
sulted in regard to the matter. He con
templated civil proceeding in order to se
cure the much desired deeds. In order to
know how to proceed he was very desirous !
of securing from Waltball a full state- j
mem as to the status of the case. The |
latter protested that he was innocent of
any wrong-dome and told a plausible
story. He declared that Robbins was at
fault, as he refused or neglected to send in
the deeds, although the nioney|paid over
had been faithfully sent to lnrn.
In one of tlie interviews Walthail told
Attorney rferrington that he would prove
that be had sent money to Roboins by
showing some receipts and vouchers taat
he had received from him.
"Walthall made a number of appoint
ments to come to my office and show me
tho-e paper-, but lie never came," said
District Attorney Herrington in an inter
view. "Last Friday I started out after
Walthall and found him at his home on
ctouth Second street late in the afternoon.
He. then promised faithfully that he
would attend to the securing of the papers
immediately. He said he would hunt up
the bookkeeper and have him open the
safe at the granite works, secure the pa
pers and report at my office not later than
8 o'clock. 1 waited for him, but as usual
he did not put in an appearance.
"About this time it began to be sus
pected that Walthall woukl make an at
tempt to leave the city. The depots were
watched by officers after last Friday, but
but he was not seen leaving on it train,
and he probubJy left on a bicycle that
night after he saw me.
"One of my clients who consulted me
had paid Walthall J2OOO, and held a con
tract calling for a deed, but it was never
delivered to him. I have never heard
directly from Robbins. but I understand
others have had correspondence with nim,
and he claimed that Walthall never sent
him a cent of money in connection with
the land transaction."
John Klee, one of the holders of lots in
the Ware Tract, took a mortgage for $2000
on the Waithall residence on South Sec
ond street, to Â«ecnre him for money he
had paid to Wilthall. The property was
assessed for $56G1. Besides the s2ooo mort
gage there are said to be ottier incum
brances on the property, and to-day two
attachment suits for amounts aggregating
$1816 were be>:un in the Superior Court
E. C. Sineletary brought a suit for $1100
and the Garden City Bank began a suit
for $718.
Walthall also got into pmbarras?in<Â»
complications in connection with his
transactions as apent for the Roberts
building on South Fourth street. He rep
resented to the owner of the property R
R. Roberts, that he could not rent the
upper portion of the building. The fact
of the matter was that the upper story
was rented for a lodging-house, and the
landlady paid her rent regularly to
Walthall. One day the owner of the prop
erty chanced to go' into the building on a
tonr cf inspection. To his surprise he
found the landlady in posse-sion and
learned from her how matters Mood. He
then took his agent to task, and immedi
ately deprived him of the agency of the
building. No criminal proceedings was
besun, Walthall promising to make aset
tipment soon. After long delay he paid
As agent for the National Insurance
I Company of Hartford he issued policies
! for which he did not account, but this
m.ttter was also compromised.
Waithall was a candidate for Supervisor
in the recent election. During tne cam
! paiÂ«n the Roberts building transaction
I was published in a weekly paper and Wai
! thall caused the arrest of tne editor for
! libel, but in a few days dismissed the case.
; He was defeated.
CLOVERDALE'S SENSATION.
Bride of a Day Deserted, and a Neighbor's
Wife Arrested for Abducting a
Child.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Nov. 16.â The ar
rest of Mrs. John G. Caldwell, the wife of
a prosperous rancher at Geyserville, and
the disappearance of John F. Dixon, late
of Cloverdale, have caused a sensation
from one end of this couuty to the other.
Dixon was a widower with one child a
girl agea 4 years. He had be.en engaged
in farming near Cloverdale, and having
sold his grapes for some $1800 concluded
to try a second matrimonial venture; so
on Thursday, at the Grand Hotel in this
city, John F. Dixon and Mrs. Lottie Cri^
ler, of Cloverdale, were made man and
wife by Justice Bali win. Mrs. Crieler
was the widow of brave Constable Ciigier,
who was murdered by stage-robbers a few
years ago.
Dixon had rented a farm north of Santa
Rosa, and with his bride went to Clover
u'aio oa Friday morning to pack up their
belongings and settle down at their new
home. On arriving at Cloverdale, the
rancher went to Albertz Winery and drew
his $1800. There he was met by Mrs.
Caldwell, and an animated conversation
ensued. Dixon was seen going down the
road afoot at this time, but his where
abouts since is shrouded in mystery.
Mrs. Caidwell was mounted on a good
liorse and from the winery went toward
her home. On Sunday morning she man
aged to secure the possession of Dixon's
little girl and mounting her fleet horse,
with the child before her, fled to Healds
burg. Here she was arrested for abduc
tion. She secured her release on bottds
and engaged a prominent Santa Rosa at
torney to defend her.
The case is involved in deep mystery at
present and rumors of all kinds are afloat.
One report is that Dixon has been found
in Fulton, and that he refuses to make
any statement ns to his all -eed desertion
of his bride of twenty-four hours.
Mrs. Caidwell is favorably known in the
northern end of this county, and claims to
have authority from Dixon for taking the
child.

that wo finally break down. .it la for this
reason that most of us stand in constant
need of something to build up the system
and enable us to stand the ecvere strains
to which we are subjected.
As a means of preventing the debilitat-
ing effects worry and overwork many
eminent physicians recommend the use of
a pure stimulant at meal time. Pure malt
whiskey has been found to give the best
results, and experiments have proved that
the safest and best of all whiskies is Duffy's
pure malt. This is because it is no ordinary
whiskey, but a pure medicinal stimulant
which gives stimulative nourishment to
the whole body. ; Its health-giving effects
are speedily shown in a clear skin, a bright-
er complexion and increased strength.
Inquire and you will be surprised to
find how many friends of yours are also
friends of Duffy's pure malt whiskey.

Franchise Granted to the
People's Mutual Tele
, * phone Ccmpany.
Genuine Competition and Re
duced Rate of Taxat on
Promised.
Gecrge G. Gauld, Who Opposes the
New Corporation, Is Denounced
as Irresponsible.
.â¢ After several months of waiting and a
great deal ot contention a franchise has
been granted for a competitive telephone
company in this City.
â¢ Juage Seawell yesterday rendered a de
cision that seems to make possible the es
tablishment of such a system for San
Francisco and the surrounding country.
The matter on hearing was a petition
signed by George G. Gauld for a writ of.
review of the action ol the Board of Super
visors, who have taken certain steps to
grant a franchise to the People's Mutual
Telephone Company, pending tiie hearing
. oi which an injunction had been served
. on the Supervisors directing them to do
â¢ nothing further without an order of court.
* Attorneys Friedrich and Crittenden ap
peared on behalf of the new telephone
company and asked that the injunction
te d.ssolved. In support of this they
â¢urged that it was a matter of great im
portance to the people of San Francisco
Miat speedy action should be taken, and
that 't would cause great and irreparable
doss to their company if the injunction
winch was difected against the Super
visors should be allowed to continue.
Mr. Crittenden asserted that the only
â¢power arrayed against tlie granting of the
. franchise is ati immense and wealthy
_ monopoly known as the Pacific Bell Tele
"phoue Company. He contended that the
injunction against the Supervisors had
be,en obtained ir. the interest of that cor
poration and tnat Gauld w^as in fact a
mere figurehead who was being used for
â¢* the purpose of injuring the community
. and the company which, he represented.
Touching this matter, the attorneys for
ttie new telophone company filed an an
â¢ Biter to Gauhi's petition in which the en
tire tUnation is clearly set forth according
to their views. The action being brought
against the Board of Supervisors it was
the; duty of City and County Attorney
Creswell to ai^pear on their behalf, which
he accordingly did, and interposed a de
murrer to Gauld's petition. He granted
"permission for the People's Mutual Tele
' phone Company to appear aÂ«t a party in
interest, and the answer of that company
â¢ covers the ground pretty thoroughly. One
paragraph reads as follows:
This iniervertor believes and charges that
the real purpose, object and intention of the
said George G. Gauid in the above-entitled
matter and in seeking the writ of review was
tv wrongfully, unlawfully and fraudulently
prevent, hinder, delay and defeat the granting
of nny iranchlse for a competing telephone
system or for any telephone system in the City
. hiiil County of Francisco to the People's Mu
â¢lu.il Tt-rernone Company, or To any one else,
and to onlay action by the Board" of Super
visors upon the bid lor said franchise pre
sented by the People's Mutual Telephone Com
pany until such a time as will make it impos
ssijjle for the People's Mutual Telephone Com
pany to carry out any contracts between it and
the persons who httve contracted lor the use
of its telephone system.
GauMs standing a3 a taxpayer was then
attacked.
The learned counsel intimated that it
called them sorely to have a man like
Gauld, with only $60 worth of assessable
- property in this City, standing thus in the
â¢ fray of public improvement.
The alluring prospect of a reduction of
taxation is then pointed out.
Considerable space is given to an ex
planation that the new company, if al
lowed lo proceed, will furnish a genuinely
competitive telephone system, and the an
swer adds:
This intervenor is informed and believes
that the City and County ot San Francisco are
â¢ jiiyinc out for the use of telephones aoout
$15,000 a year and receive no part whatever
of ajiy income of any telephone company; that
said City and County will be benefited "by the
pranting of said franchise anrt the successiul
. introduction of a competing telephone system
under such franchise to the extent of at least
a year for fifty years.
These points were not discussed at
length, but were only touched upon by
the attorneys so far a 1? was necessary to
give the court an understanding ofthe
case.
Attorney Friedrich said that the new
. telephone comj any did not ask for an im
mediate hearing of the petition on its
merits, but only desired that the injunc
tion ba dissolved, in order that the Super
visors misht have the privilege of opening
the bid that had been fixed by the new
telephone company. He did not suppose
that the Supervisors would go any farther
than that, and if they did, and Mr. Gauld
should finally win and the action of the
â¢ Supervisors should be annulled, then tiie
loss would fall on the new telephone com
pany and on no one else.
Attorney Brobeck, representinc the City
and County Attorney, said that Mr. Cres
well, in compliance with a request made
by attorneys Woods & Levuiikv. who
represent petitioner Gauld, had signed ai
' stipulation allowing the case to go over I
until next Friday. He suggested that an !
order be made in accordance with that j
stipulation.
Herman de la Ligura, who represented '
himself as clerk for Woods & Levinsky, (
attempted to join in the argument, but an '
ob-jt-ciion beiiii: made that he was not a
member of the bar, be was quickly sup
pressed and compelled to take his seat.
Mr. Laguna was sharply criticized some
time ago when he attempted to i;iakc a
similar address Defore the Board of Super- i
visors. Lie was denounced as a specu
lator in franchises wnich he could not
carry out.
Mr. Bn derick said that when the ca*e
comes to be heard on its merits the City
Aitorney's office would give al! its energy
and ability to supporting the action of the
Board of Supervisors in whatever they do
touching thu granting of the franchise.
Judge Seawell said that he recognized
the fact ti at the City Attorney had signeJ
the stipulation for a continuance till next
Fr.day as an act of courtesy to the attor
neys lor the petitioner, and he would let
that stipulation remain in force so far as
it related to hearing the case on its mer
its. It would not in any way endanger
the rights of Mr. Gould to dissolve the in
junction and would not in atiy manner
compromise the City Attorney. He there
fore vacated that part of the order which
retrained the Supervisors from opening
the bids of me People's Mutual Telephone
Company for a franchise.
In the Board of Supervisors yesterday
afternoon Supervisor Benjamin informed
tbe Mayor and the bo:iro ot Judge Sea
well's action, whereupon the bid of the
People's Mutual Telephone Company was
opened. It was found to be for $111 L, and
the requisite amount of cash accompanied
â¢ the bid.
Mayor Suiro acted as receiving feller
and counted the coin, after which the
board by formal vote awarded the fran
chise to the before-mentioned company.
There werÂ«j no other applicants.

STORMS RAGING
ALONG THE COAST
Half a Dozen Steamers
Overdue on Account
of Gales.
Graphic Description of One Given
by the Captain of the
Sraigow.
Sveral Narrow Escapes on the Bay
From the Southeaster Are
Recorded.
The storm ihat has prevailed along the
coast for the last ten days has been the
severest encountered in years. Several dis
asters have been reported, and until the
overdue fleet of steamers gets in the full
extent of the trouble will not be known.
At the present time the Homer from Coos
Bay is away overdue, her schedule lime
being f> a. m. last Sunday. The Costa Kica
from Departure Bay and the Maclciuaw
from Tacorna are now out over ri?e days, ,
and the A ice Blanchard left Astoria for
San Francis-co on the 11th inst. The big
passenger steamer Walia Walla was fully
due from Puget Sound ports yesterday
morning, and the Alaska Commercial
Company's Dora from Sitka left Port
Townsend on the 10:h inst.
An idea of tne storm raging on the coast
may be gathered from the report of tbe
captain of the British ship Snaigow:
On Sunday, November 8, at 2 p. m. , the gale
commenced, and as we run into it we struck a
lumpy sea and drizzling rain.
a: 4 r. m. hauled in all small sails, including
royals.
At 5 P. M. vrrv thick rain and freshening
breeze with heavy gusta (east), sea rising
rapidly. While preparing to lake In topgallant
sails the outer jib burst andb.ew into ribbons,
also the wire ruu tiers cf the inner jib ha. yards
carried away, causing sail to be partly torn.
While securing the remnants of these, the
foretopgullant sail burst, and while clewing v
up the main one blew to pieces before we
could do anything with it, although all hauus
were on deck at tne time.
At 0 P. M. the roizzeii topsail sheet carried
away, but the sail was secured ana set again
without further damage.
At 8 p. M. the ship was under six topsails
and courses, wind about east, blowing iresh
and gusty, continuous drizzte rain, oeeastou
ally very tnick. Sea had by this time risen
considerably and caused ship to rear and
plunge Irigntfu.ly, straining everything to the
last gasp. Very vivid sheet lightning north
west uy north and southeast, barometer con
tinuing steady,
10 P. M.â Crossjack tackle carried away in a
heavy squall. Ail nands called, but could not
save "the sail, which blew away piece by piece,
itiao destroying the gear (bunilines, leechlines,
etc.) Bcf jre tho hands were down from aloit
a squall of hurricane force struck us and the
main tuck curried away, the sail bursting In
pieces and being almost comp.etely destroyed.
Midnightâ Trie heaven* were now one flicker
ing blaze of lightning with occasional inter
vals ol two and three minutes, during wbleta
t.ie darkness \v.\r so intense that it was lliera:
ly impossible to see your hand before you.
Kain whs tailing in torrents and a tremendous
sea was running, Into which the vessel wiis
pitching (rightfully, and when kept away be
fore the wind, rolled heavily enough (though j
in baliau trim) to scoop the water over the !
rails. After the mainsail went it continued {
i blowing a living gate at ca-t-southeast and the
i other sails soon loilowed, the fore, upper and
! lower topsails, main upper and mizzeu upper
i topsi'.iis "blew c can out oi the ropes, leaving i
! me iranifs only standing.
3 a. m.â While running with foretail and
I main and mizzen lower topsails one watch r.ail

up.
Three men were in a punt alongside the
British, ship Genesta, painting the sides,

fore they could make their escape a squall
capsized the punt and nil three were left
struggling in the water. Two of them
caught rop^s thrown from the ship, but
the third, Harry Jones, was swept away
by the tide. Boats were lowered from the
Genesta, Travancoreand Rhudland Castle,
but they liad quite a chase after the sailor,
who was vainly trying to stem the tide.
The Travancore's boat finally ricked up
the unfortunate sailor in an exhausted
condition, and placed him aboard that
ship. He was brought around and later on
put aboard die Genesta.
Willie Conway, the son of a bricklayer
who lives on Powell street, nearly lost his
life yesterday. He fell overboard from
Meiggs wharf while fishing, and was be

when off Lime Point the high wind and
tide took possession of the vessel and
swept her into Kichardson* Bay. Tne
Ktjorn was put in irons and the anchor
dropped. In this way she held until the

towed tbe bark lo a safe anchorage. The

Halse is one of tbe most popular masters
that come? to San Francisco, he left
Newcastle in company with fifteen other

vessel, the betting in San Francisco was
that she would lead the fleet. Instead of
being first sh<Â» is absolutely last, much to
the di'gust of the captain and the backers

says that on a number of occasions the
Stjorn made remarkably fine runs, but
thai tuese were al offset by the dead

THE BENNINGION'S LOSS.
Five of tho Sailors and Nineteen of
the Firemen Are Missing Since
Saturday.
The gunboat Bennington has not been
in luck with her men since she came into
port. Five of the sailors are classed as de
serters and nineteen of the firemen have
overstayed their leave by rive days. The
men say they have a grievance against the
chief engineer, but when the matter came
to be sif'.ed 'town it turned out that the
chief's "inhuman conduct" consisted in
making the men work when they were
seasick. All the firemen have spent their
allowance and many of them are anxious
to return to the gunboat before she leaves
for Mare Island, but are afraid to. Some
of them were yesterday asking Sergennt
Mahoney to arrest them as deserters, but
he refused Â«.o do so, saying no orders had
been received from the captain ol the war
ship.
The Alert was taking in provisions and
coal yesterday, but owing to the south
easter bad to suspend operations. As soon
as the gale blows itself out she will sail
for Honolulu
The smokestack had to be taken out of
the Czarina again yesterday. No ailow
nnce had beÂ«;n made for the tact that the
boilers had been set up higher and in j
consequence when completed and set ap |
the new stack was ten feet too high. The i
extra ten feet will be cut off and then the I
stacK will be reset. The steamer will not ,
be ready for service before the new year.
The ship Caliiornia, the last of the
"White Star line of clippers, is to be sold
at public auction in Liverpool to-day. The
Caliiornia was one of the most popular
ships that came to San Francisco, and Cap
tain Blair, her master, was well known here.
The White Star line will after to-day be
represented by steamers only.
George Fie.d, the superintendent of
construction of the RisJon Iron Works,
employed on the new ferry depot, met
with a painful accident yesterday. An
iron eirder fell on his foot and smashed
his toes. He was taken to his home in
the Hotel Savoy, but it will be several

Whlie there is some talk, about difficulty
about securing nicnlor the United States navy
there is no trouble in this City in securing
men lo enlist in the marine branch of the ser
vice. '-There arc many applicants," said the
sergeant in charge of the recrut ting office on
Kills street yesterday, "there are plenty of
applicants, but the trouble is to get men who

WISH TO LEGALIZE
THEIR SCHEDULE
Trains May Soon Run at
Thirty Miles an
Hour.
The Southern Pacific Company
Sends a Fetition to the
Supervisors.
City Printing Contract Awarded to
the Daily Report Publishing
Company.
The Southern Pacific Company is seek
ing to legalize an illegal proceeding in
which it has been indulging for many
moons.
The ordinance regulating the speed of
trains in the City and County of San
Francisco calls for not more than eight
miles an hour, but it is a well-known fact,
proven e*en by its own time card, that the
company runs trains between Tbird and
Townsend and the Valencia-street station
at a of fully fifteen miles an hour
and between Valencia-street station and
the county line at fully twenty-five ruiies
an hour.
To this great speed is attributed the
numerous accidents to which several lives
have been lost, that have occurred during
the past few years.
A Detition was presented to the Super
visors yesterday asking that the spÂ«ed of
trains be lixed at not more than 15 miles
an hour between Third and Townsend
and Valencia-street stations and at not
more than 30 miles an hour between the
latter atop and the county line.
The company also asks for an ordinance
forbidding trespass on the tracks, except
at crossings. The petition was referred
to the Street Committee.
The ordinance increasing the license of
ticket brokers from $10 per quarter to $100
per month was laid over two weeks.
The order granting Bateman Bros, the
contract for builniiK the new municipal
building at $i>l,6'X) wns finally passed.
The r bond was tixed at $63,500 with a
penalty of $100 for each day after Novem
ber 1, 1897.
Three bids for the City printing for the
next two years were presented, and the
contract was awarded to the Daily Report
Publishing Company.
The three evening papers, the Post,
Bulletin and the Report were the only
bidders, each agreeing to publish the City
advertisements for one, three or live in
sertions for nothing, the advertisements
charged to property-owners to be at the
old rates.
Charles D. Soule was employed by a
resolution presented by Supervisor Taylor
to copy map-, and other records in' the
Recorder's office that are in bad condition
and in danger of being obliterated. His
compensation is not to exceed $450.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
A Secretary of Mines would be popular.
The preat industry of the great West
deserves recognition.
Public confidence in McKinley is shown
by the way business talks.
The McKinley Cabinet ought to be
larger than Cleveland's as well as greater.
The good prospect for railroad building
means pood prospects for all other kinds
of building.
Business is better than charity, but all
the same at this season charity should not
be forgotten.
Make your home a market for home
goods and you will help to make other
homes prosperous.
Bismarck does not talk as much as the
Kaiser, but all the same the Kaiser thinks
he talks too much.
Bryan's speech on Saturday opened the
new campaign for free silver with a sound
as if the hinges were worn out.
The entertainment to be provided
Bryan on his visit to Senator Jones of
Arkansas will probably be a ghost dance.
Democracy may possibly get together
again, but it will require the service of a
itreet sweeper to gather up the fragments.
A little while ago we were all expressing
a desire for a wet winter on this coast and
now Seattle wants the whole thing to
dry up.
McKinley is certainly a magnetic man.
The business of the whole country feels
the thrill of a new movement since his
election.
We have once more reaci.ed the season
when the affairs of Turkey excite in
American minds only pleasant and jocose
fee-lings.
If the assessors' convention does no
more than arouse public interest in the
subject of tax reform ii will do good work
and justify its calling.
People who delight in guessing contests
may now amuse themselves in gnessing
how many turkeys will be sent to the Mc-
Kinley family this year.
However good the poultry show In San
Jose may be it will serve to remind ns we
ought to make a better show of tne poul
try industry in tbis State than we do.
Senator Jones congratulates the Bryan-
Ites that the late campaign rid the Demo
cratic party of barnacles, but he overlooks
the fact that it smashed tbe ship to pieces
in doing it.
There is no danger of war witn Spain,
but all the same tbe coast defenses of the
Nation will be put into better condition at
once. Uncle San: must be ready for sur
prise parties.
Cleveland is writing his message, Mc-
Kinley is making up his cabinet, Con
gressmen are getting ready thtir bills,
and before long we will be up to the neck
in politics again.
Cleveland's Commissioner of Navigation
will recommend the adoption of a free
ship bill, but as the people wish ships of
home builders the recommendation will
go to the wastebasket.
Currency reform will be one of the big
problems of the immediate future, and
fortunately we will have an administra
tion which can be counted on to solve it
promptly ana properly.
Impatient charter-makers may consols
themselves with the thought that those
Who go slowly go safely. The next time
we frame a charter we should frame one
the people will support.
Cleveland will spend the rest of his term
trying to get his friends into life positions,
and while there are not many places of
that kind, there are probably enough for
what friends he has left
If no partisan legislation can be enacted
this winter there will be all the more time
to attend to matters which are not of a
partisan character. Now is the time to
press the Nicaragua canal bill.
There seems to be no possibility of the
passage of an adequate revenue bill at the
coming session of Congress. Democracy
has still power enough in the Senate to
play dojr in the raaneer, and i 3 evidently
determined to do it.
It is to be hoped Milk Inspector Dockery
will be able to completely refute the
charges made against him. He has done
such good work that the people trust nim
and expect him to show himself worthy
of their confidence to the end of his term.
Despite the big apple crop in the East
the demand for California fruit has been
bo great that nearly the whole of this sea
son's product has been shipped already
and the crop of next year will probably
have a clean market and good prices wait*
ing for it.
A fear that the end of the world is
coming in 1899 has so disturbed Germany
the Kaiser has thought it worth while to
issue a proclamation to his subjects de
claring it is not so, and so far as the
Germans are concerned that settles it. It
will never occur to tnem that the Kaiser
baan't the determining voice as to whether
the world is to end or not.
A NEEDED OFFICIAL.
The interviews published in The Call
yesterday and this morning on the subject
of the appointment of a Secretary of Mines
and Mining show bow thoroughly the im
portance of this subject Pa understood by
leading men in the State. It la clear
therefore that if a resolute effort is made
by the Miners' Association to obtain the
appointment of such an official they will
not lack for support from their fellow
citizens.
The time is propitious for making a
vigorous appeal for this enlargement of
the Cabinet. With the accession to office
of President McKinley there will begin a
new era to the mining industry as well as
anew administration, it will of course
be the ambition of the new Government
to promote every industry of the country,
and therefore the inclination will be favor
able to the appointment of the much
desired official.
Every reason points to tie conclusion
that the Miners' Association and those
mainly interested in the subject should be
diligent at this time in pressing their de
tires upon Congress. If the work is once
fairly started California will not be left to
prosecute it alone. We can certainly
count upon ihe whole of the greater West
to act with us, and there will be strong in
ducements for tbe mining States of the
East to co-operate.
The industry of mininej is so vast, so
varied and so widely spread that all the
great sections of the country and almost
all important States have an interest in it.
The existing condition of affairs is cer
tainly not satisfactory to the miners of
any portion of the country. They have j
therefore every inducement to combine
and work together for the appointment of
a representative in the Cabinet, and with
such inducements to the industry gen
erally it seems clear thai nothing is needed
for success but a vigorous and competent
leadership.
That leadership it devolves upon Cali
fornia to provide. This is in many re
spects the greatest mining State in the
Union. Our hydraulic miners have more
to ask and more to expect from the Gov
ernment than the miners of any other
State. They have undoubtedly more care
fully studied the subject than those of
other sections, and it is from among them '
therefore that the leader should come.
We repeat that whatever the miners
may do in this direction will have the
cordial support of The Call. We will
give to the contest all the space needed to
attract public attention and to concentrate
popular sentiment on the issue. We de
sire to see the great mining industry of
this country advanced rapidly to its full
est possible development. We believe
that result can be effected best under the
supervision of a Cabinet officer backed by
all the powers of the Government, and we
therefore, not less than the miners, desire
to bring about the appointment ol such
an official.
The tasK of securing such a Cabinet offi
cer is not one of easy accomplishment, but
it can be effected if the right means are
used. Let all the mining States be brought
to act together and their combined force
will be too powerlul to be resisted. To
secure this unity of action is the first step
to be taken. Let that step be made this
winter and it is within thÂ« limits of prob
ability that President McKinley may have
the satisfaction of appointing to his Cab
inet from Cali ornia, or at least from the
great West, a Secretary of Mines and
Mining.
THE WRIGHT LAW.
The long vexed question of the constitu
tionality of the Wright irrigation law has
been settled by the decision of the Su
preme Court overruling Judge Ross and
maintaining the constitutionality of the
act.
The decision is based upon principles
which are aa firmly founded upon com
mon sense as upon law. Justice Peckham
declared substantially that whether an ir
rigation law is constitutional or not de
pends upon the condition of the district
where it is applied, and that the Legisla
ture and the courts of any particular State
are the best judges of the necessity which
constitutes the element of validity in the
law.
In the ense before the court the Justice
said: "The people of California and the
members of her legislative body must in
tbe nature of thinps be more familiar with
the facts and circumstances which sur
round the subject and with the necessities
and occasion for the irrigation of lands
than can any one who is a stranger to her
soil."
The law as thus stated is exactly in
accordance with the common-sense view
of the case, irrigation i 3 now declared to
be constitutional wherever it is necessary
for the cultivation of the soil, and the
Legislature and the courts of each State
are the judges of that necessity. There is
no attempt to make one law for the whole
of our diversified Union. The variation of
conditions is recognized and justice is
done to all.
It is well known that the Wright law
has not been altogether satisfactory in its
working. Many complaints have been
made of it and some of these have been
undoubtedly well founded. It will now
be in order for the opponents of the law to
point out the evils and seek a remedy for
them by getting the law amended. It
ought not to be difficult to do this, for cer
tainly the promoters of irrigation do not
intend to wrong anybody.
Whatever may be the defects of the
present act there can be no question of its
general benefits.to the State. It is a most
important thing for California that the
constitutionality of the general principle
of the law has been established. We may
now look for the rapid development of
many sections of the State which other
wise would have to remain barren forever.
GOVERNOR BUDD'S INFLUENCE.
The vote of California in the recent elec
tion has now been so thoroughly can
vassed that but little change can be ex
pected from the official count. The State
will cast its electoral vote for McKinley,
but by a popular majority much less than
it should have been.
When we recall how vast is the interest
of the people of California in the main
tenance of sound money and the establish
ment of protection, it can hardly fail to be
a matter of surprise to intelligent men that
the popular majority in favor of those poli
cies was only about 3000. We ought to
have polled at least twice that amount,
and it is a matter of disappointment that
we did not.
Scarcely another progressive State in the
Union made so poor a showing as Cali
fornia and it is worth while to inquire
into the cause of this failure to roll up a
rousing majority for McKinley and Ho
bart. Nor will it be necessary to inquire
far. In other States every Democrat of
influence, whether derived from personal
character or official position, refused to
give aid 6r support to Bryanism. In Cali
fornia it was different. No less a person
than the Governor of the State came out
on that side and made a personal canvass
for Bryan and the fusion ticket.
While this action of the Governor met
with deserved rebuke during the cam
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1896.
paign he and his friends may have re
garded the rebuke as an outcome of the
political agitation of the time. It is there
fore well to return to it now in order that
a calmer and more effective condemna
tion may be pronounced upon it and pub
lic disapproval brought home both to tbe
Governor and to those who were partly
responsible for his course.
The campaign was essentially one of
well ordered prosperity and tbe main
tenance of law against discontent, finan
cial folly and class prejudices and pas
sions. The whole conservative element of
the people was arrayed on one side, and
the victory promised to be as over
whelming here as it was in the East,
when the Governor, forgetting official
propriety and the non-partisan character
of his high office, entered with extraordi
nary energy and impassioned zeal into
the contest.
It is beyond question that to this action
of Governor Budd was due the doubtful
character ot the struggle in tbe closing
days of the campaign, and to him is to be
attributed the fact that California did not
give the Republican ticket a majority that
conservative citizens would be proud of.
The truth ia made clear by the vote in
this City, where a large majority was ex
pected, but where his influence was suf
ficient to reduce it to the very verge of
defeat.
The people of California will know how
to pass proper judgment upon this action
of their chief executive. It will not take
them long to decide whether it is per
missible for a Governor of California to
play the part of a Btumn orator and exert
his influence In advancing a purely par
tisan cause. Governor Budd was tbe
most potent force on the Bryanite side in
this State, ami had tbe electoral vote been
lost to the great cause of prosperity and
good government it would havo been due
almost wholly to what public opinion will
regard as the "pernicious activity" of an
official who should have kept out of the
canvass altogether.
A TWICE-TOLD TALE.
The speech delivered by Mr. Bryan on
Saturday, and which was announced as
the beginning of a new campaign of edu
cation, has been perhaps the most com
plete failure ever made by any orator who
possessed anything like a National re
pute. So far irom reviving interest in
the subject, it fell as flat as a twice-told
tale and palled upon a public mind al
ready sated with overmuch of Bryau, as
well as of Bryanism.
In the whole speech, from beginning to
end, there is hardly a sentence worth
quoting. There is uot a sentiment which
could revive tne drooping spirits of his
followers nor one which could win him
sympathy from even the most tender
hearted of his opponents. It lacks fire,
force and eloquence. It was the most
commonplace oratory imaginable, and
will have no effect whatever in increasing
his reputation or advancing his cause.
The whole speech was a plea for a con
tinued agitation of the monetary question.
It was made up of iterations and reitera
tions that a cause is not crushed by being
defeated once. Such truisms as this are
so well known that they can hardly be
called anything else than platitudes.
It devolved upon ilr. Bryan to show
his followers some reason why they should
expect success hereafter or why their
cause is one which people should continue
to fight for. He did neither of these
tilings, nor did he attempt to do them.
His talk was that of an exhausted man,
who speaks simpls* because he feels that
be must say something, and not thut he
is conscious of having something which
he must say.
The country can well afford to dismiss
Bryan and Bryanism from' its thoughts.
Long before the next Presidential election
approaches all our monetary problems
will have been solved and well settled by
the McKinley administration. We shall
then be prepared to look forward to new
things. Wnat issues are to arise it is im
possible to forecast, but we can be very
sure of wnat issues will not arise.
There will be no longer any assaults
upon the protective system of industry or
the Republican system of iir.ance. These
things have been appealed to the people
and the people have responded by en
trusting their management to able and
sagacious statesmen. 8o lar as they are
concerned, therefore, they have passed be
yond the domain of Presidential politics
and will soon t.ake their places among
those measures which are regarded as the
settled policies of the American Republic.
There is every reason to believe, more
over, that Bryan will cease to be a National
leader as soon as Biysnisa ceases to be a
political issue. The boy orator has not
shown during the campaign or in his last
speech any of that versatility of statecraft
or innate force of character which en
ables some men to rise after a crushing
defeat. He is little more than a doc
trinaire. His fortunes are linked with one
idea, and now as that idea has no longer
anj large following amone the people the
man who advocates it will soon cease to
be regarded as a leader of a great political
party.

LADY'S FIVE-GORED SKIRT.
A graceful skirt of medium width is much
used alike for silk, woolen and other fabrics.
The two back gores are laid in box-pleats, or
they may be gathered. Tho width of the me
dium size is four-and-a-half yards. When nar-
row fabrics are used it is necessary to piece
out each gore.
Wide materials, which are not twice the
width of the goods, should be opened out and
doubled across tho length. In this way the
back and side cores may be "cutout of one
length, if there is no up and down to patter*'.
The side pores are cut with a straieht e<lge to
meet tne front gores. The back gor^s are bias
on both sides. If striped Roods is used, and
ono wishes to havo tne stripes meet at all
seams, fola the side gore through its length,
making the edges meet the center on a straight
thread at all seams; fold the side gores, mak
ing edges meet, and crease down (be center.
Then place this crease on a lengthwise thread
or at stripe, and cut; this brings both seams
on the bias.

GENERAL JOHN S. RUNNELLS, Chief of the Legal Department
of the Pullman Car Company.
IS RETAINED BY
BIG CORPORATIONS
Arrival of General J. S.
Runnells of the Pull
f man Company.
Governor Altgeld, He Says, Can
Never Dig Himself Out of
the Landslide.
Attorney Runnells Has Been en L e gal
Business in the Northwest â His
First Trip H?re.
Among the arrivals here yesterday was
General John fc. Runneils of Chicago,
general attorney of the George M. Pull
man Palace Car Company. General Run
nells is one of the most noted attorneys in
the country. He used to practice law in
Dcs Moines, lowa, but went to Chicago a
few years ago because of a greater field.
He is the author of legal worn*, and a
heavy-weight in the land. His salary is
probably not leas t an $50,000 a year, and
maybe more.
General Runnells came over the North
ern Pacific Railroad. He is accompanied
by Attorney William B. Pettit of his
office. They are here, so General Run
nels says, on minor business matters,
their larger business being i:i the North
west. They will be here for a few daye.
General Runnels has never been In Cali
fornia before.
"I came over on the last train of the
Northern Pacific, through a snowstorm,"
said he, "and consider myself fortunate.
The rains in tbe mountains and along the
Sound have caused great floods every
where. We only made one stop, and that
was at Tacoma.
"Our business here is not of much sig
nificance. There are one or two little mat
ters, but not of public interest. 1 have
never been in this State before, and am
glad to have had the opportunity of com
ing here. I have traveled a great deal and
been in Europe several times, but strange
to say I havo not previously been any fur
ther west than Topeka and Lincoln.
"I see you have had an election here.
It was close compared with what it was in
Illinois, where we buried the Democracy
under an avalanche of more than 160,000
votes. No; Ido not believe that Altgeld
can ever get to the front again and win in
Illinois. He is buried completely.
"Well, it is just tnat he should be, for
he is, if not a communist, at least a lev
eler. He doesn't want any man higher
than another. Then he is so bitter in his
denunciations and so persistent in putting
them forward that he is, all things con
sidered, the kind of man that ought to be
kept in the background. I don't think he
can ever climb up a^ain in Illinois poli
tics."
General Runnells is only as yet of mid
dle a^e. He is an able speaker, as well as
author, and has great reputation as an
orator throughout th â¢ East. Durine the
great strike at Pullman General Runnelis'
name figured much in the news that was
sent out from Chicago.
TO PAY OFF THE DEBT.
A Monster Entertainment to Be Given
by tbe Catholic Ladies' Aid Society.
Preparations are being made by a com
mittee of ladies of the Catholic Ladies'
Aid Society to yive an entertainment for
the purpose of raising fund* with which
to raise a mortgage of $6000 on their prop
erty in Santa Cruz County. It had been
decided to give the entertaiihnent, which
will be a monster one, at the California
Theater, on the 27th mat., but at a meet
ing of the committee, held yesterday
afternoon, at which Mrs. M. H. deYoung
presided, it was announced that tbe dale |
oxed was not agreeable to certain persons |
who have volunteered, therefore it was
changed to the 24th inst., and it was also
decided that the entertainment shall be
given in the Auditorium. A number of
tickets have already been sold for the first
given date, but these can be exchanged
by application to Miss Alatel Curtis, sec
retary of the aid society.
The society secured the Hotel del Mar,
intending to use it as a home for invalids,
but found that they could not iw it for
the purpose until the <:ebt of $6000 was J
paid, therefore they are working euer
getically with a view to pay off lhat in
debtedness.

HUNTINGTON GETTING READY
TO FORCE THE FUNDING BILL
He Has Deferred His Usual Autumn Trip to Cali
fornia Until the Spring in Furtherance
of This Plan.
Desires to Direct the Movements
of His Forlorn Hope at
Short Range.
CROCKSR'S INTERESTING VIEWS
Siys the Corporation Prefers Gov
ernment Ownership of the Cen
tral Pacific.
Collis P. Hnntington, president of the
Southern Pacific Company, whose custom
it is to visit California at this season each
year, has decided to defer his coming
until spring, despite the fact that hfs ele
gant residence on California street has
already been prepare 1 for his cominp.
His change of plan is due to his desire
to personally and at short range direct the
tight for the passage of the Central Pacific
refunding bill during the short session of
Congress which begins on the first Mon
day in December and lasts until the 4th of
March, I^7, when the newly elected Pres
ident is inaugurated and the new Con
gress conies into power.
It is admitted on all sides, prominent
Southern Pacific officials included, that
the last hope for securing an extension of
the Central Pacific's indebtedness to the
Government lies in this meeting of Con
gress. Failure here means the abandon
ment of the project to avert foreclosure,
for it is conceded that there will be neither
time nor opportunity to put a refunding
measure through a new Congress.
Huntington fully realizes this, and ]
while not exact! in position to lead the i
forlorn hope himself will pest himself
where he c:m be close to the contending
forces and give encouragement when,
where and to whom it is niost necessary.
He is reported to have an advance guard
already at work at thÂ» Nation's capital
laying his iide of the question before the
members of the House as fest as they
arrive.
With the refundins bill defeated the
energies of the Southern Pacific will be
directed toward bringing about Govern
ment ownership and control of the Central
Pacific Railroad, as this, according to
Yice-Prrsident Charles F. Crocker, would
be preferable even to any scheme ot re
funding.
"We would be perfectly satisfied to have
tne Government take over the Central Pa
cific Railroad," said Colonel Crocker yes
terday. "None of those railroad dema
gogues, such as Senator White and Con
gressman Maguire. of this State, are
really sincere when they talk of Govern
ment ownership of railroads. They
dimply talk lor effect. Why we would
wili.ngiy turn over the Central Pacific in
payment of the debt due the Government
if the United States would accept the
property :it its fair valuation. In fact we]
would rather have the Government take \
possession than secure the passage of a re
funding measure."
Mayor Sutro, whose interest in the fate
of the refunding bill remains unabated, is
watching the progress of events a. closely
aa even the great railroad maguate. In an
interview he spoke as follows:
'I have no doubt that the octopus will
make a last desperate attempt to get the
i funding bill through, l don't believe,
( however, it has the least chance of suc
cess, though stranger things have hap
' pened in Congress. Tne coming session
will have but sixty working days, and in
that time the fourteen appropriation bills
providing for the expenses of government
must be passed, and this alone is enough
to occupy ali the time o! the members.
But most of the Congressmen has some pet
measure of local importance and these are
usually rushed through at this session. So
I really don't see how Mr. Huntington is
going to induce Congress to give hijn an
other bearing, for as soon as any measure
which threatens a protracted debate is
placed before the Hou^e at this time, it is
apt to be summarily voted oat of the way.
Still the situation should oe closely
watched by the friends of the people, for I
am confident one more last attempt will
be made to get the funding bill through."
THOUSANDS AT STAKE.
An Important Decision In the Case
of a Big Seizure of
Sealskins.
The United Btates Circuit Court of Ap
peals handed down an important decision
yesterday, reversing a decision of the Dis
! trict Court of Alaska. Many thousand
dollars worth of sealskins and the seizure
of a valuable steamship were involved in
the decision.
The steamship Coquitlam, with a cargo
i of 6190 sealskins, was seized by tne United
i States revenue cutter Corwin near Port
; Etches, Alaska, on June 22, 1892. She
! was taken to Sitka and turned over to the
1 Collector of Customs.
The District Attorney of Alaska fiied an
information for the seizure of the vessel
i and cargo. He charged that the vessel
j was within the limits of the Alaska col-
I Jection district when she was illegal?
| laden from various schooners with 6190
i sealskins.
None of the schooners had come to the
! proper place for discharging their cargoes
, nor had they received any permission to
j do so, and their failure lo observe the cus
j toms requirements, it is charged, was
I known to the master of the Coquitlam.
! It is charged further that the master of
, tne seized vessel transferred his cargo of
supplies to tiip schooners, and that he did
not report to any customs officers.
i The answer ot the Union Steamship
' Company of Vancouver, the owner of the
vessel, admits the transfer of the seal
skins, but denies that the schooners were
bound to the United States or that the
j merchandise wÂ«s from a foreign port or
bound to the United States or" that the
transfers were made within the district of
: Alaska. It further denies that the tran
| fers were made within the collection 1 dis
; trict of Alaska or that the merchandise
; was subjpet to duty. In the District
i Court of Alaska it was lound tnat the
! transfers were made seven miles from
j shore.
The Court of Appeals decided that there
was no proof that the statutes had been
â  vio.ated and the decree of the lower court
! to the contrary was' reversed and the libel
j dismissed.

AT THE THEATERS.
Attractions Were So Tempting That
the Kain Did Not Keep
People Away.
Lovers of thrilling melodrama reveled
in a positive orgie of excitement at the
Columbia Theater last night, where
Joseph Grismer and Piicebe Davies re
appeared, after several years' aosence,
with a play by Button Vane, and were
warmly welcomed by their friends, who
bad .evidently not forgotten them.
-"Humanity" keeps the nerves of the
spectators on the tension from start to
finish, and this resuit is achieved in a
more possible and natural way than is the
rule of plays of its kind. Part of the
action passes in England and part in
South Africa during the thick of the war
with the Boers, and the military inci
dents especially are of a startling and
sensational cuaracter. There was a splen
didly exciting scene at thÂ«Â» end of the
third act, when Joseph Grismer, a lieu
tenant in the dragoons, carrying dis
patches through the enemy's lines, foueht
a saber contest on horseback with a Boer
officer.
The other stirring scene was where the
Boers capture the ladies and make them
load their muskets for thorn to shoot at
the British troops, who are approaching
to the reecue. In a room beneath the
hero is tied, about to be shot, and the
viliain places a bomb with a lighted fuse
at his elbow. Just in the nick of time the
women revolt, turn the muskets on their
captors, whom they shoot, and burst down
the doors in time to save the her%'sllfe,
though the act ends with a grand ex
plosion.
In comparijon with these thrilling acts
even the rauch-talked-of hunt scene, with
the horses and hounds, which ended the
first act, paled into insignificance. The
stape of the Columbia Theater is scarcely
large enough to give "Humanity" full
scope, but the scenic effects made a good
showinc notwithstanding. Joseph Gri?
mer and Phoebe Davies have lost none of
their power to please. They both acted
with refreshing naturalness lor a produc
tion of the cnaracter of "Humanity." On
the whole their support was good. C. Jay
Wiliams as Manasyes Marks was espe
cially clever.
ISaldwlii Theater.
Delia Fox appeared to a good-sized audience
last night in -'Fleur de Lis," a second vaude
ville opeÂ»a of "The Little Trooper" variety.
The music was on the whole bright and
catchy, though savoring somewhat oi Offen
bach Water. The well-3ung choruses were the
best part of it.
M -s Fox herself assumed a variety of dis
guises which gave her an opportunity of dis
playing some fetching costumes and of shin
ing generally a little more than she is able to
do in "Tne Little Trooper."
The Alcazar.
"At Fort Bliss," a military drama, drew a !
fairly good house at the Alcazar, aud| the |
! action of the p^ay and the ua;uraluess of the !
j situations based on life at a post at Fort Tejon i
I are of that character that they ought to draw !
| good houses. The several churacters were in â¢
I the main well sustained, but the neatest bits
! of sciiug iv the piny were those of Miss Mary
I Buck.ey m th'j character of Zeffis Young an
j ingenue, and Gordon Foster as Lieutenant
! Robinson.
Grand Opera-House.
"A Ring of Iron" at Morosco's gives a good
opportunity fora number of capable actors and i
actresses to distinguish themselves. A large â¢
cast, including the strength of the company, j
take prominent parts In this interesti g '
; drama. The whole play overflows with fun i
I although there is the usual tragic element
, Walter Fessler is good as the villain, Sir John
Graham. MiÂ«s Bateman has a trying part as i
| his wife, and goes through many tribulations
I among them confinement in a private mad- i
house. I
The California.
The drizzle last night did not tempt theater- â 
goers to venture out, yet there was a fair !
house at the California to witness in "Darkest
Russia."
Tlvoli Opera-Houae.
Yon Suppe's three-net opera, "Donna Jua
nita," opened at the Tlvoii last evening nnd
went off very nicely for a first performance.
Thero are many reasons why this should be â  I
drawing card and have a good run and no !
reason* why it ahotiid not. The solo roles i
were well don â¢, thÂ» chorus filled the at age and I
sang with spirit and vigor, and the stage busi
ness is eood. Miss Keabrooke as Rene Dufonr i
Ferris Hartman Â«s Genernl Douglass, John J
Rrtffacl as Don Riego and W. H. West as Gasioii
Duiour were fully up to the standard. "Donua
Juanna" wiil be on through the week.
At the Orpheum.
The Orpheum's bill thir week consists largely
of holdovers. Burt Shepard, Lewis and Elliott
and Knoll and McNeil are the newcomem The
Eenial bhepird amused every one with his
jokes, maiiy of them good old friends which he
used 10 give in his minstrel dHyg.
Lewis and Elliott are sketch artists who gave
a whimsical account of their matrimonial I
squabbles. A pleasing feature was the cornet !
solos aud duet by Knoil and Miss McNeill. '
Raymond Walsh, who was seated in the gal- j
lery among trie spectators, responded by sing- I
ing "Rosie Posie" after its rendition on the 1
oornet.
Blonmfielri-Zeisler Recltnlg.
The lagt recital by Mrs. Fanny Bloomfield-
Zeisler was to have been given last evening.
The lady played to the largest audience of the
season, crowd< having come out in the rain to
biu her farewell. But Albert Marks, her man
ager, had a gratefui surprise in store in the
share of an announcement that two more re- i
cital-> will be given, namely, on Thursday
evening next and on Saturday tv '2 p. m. The
recital list evening was marked by the same
enthusiasm on thepaitof the player and au- I
di'ence alike that has characterized ttic pre- !
ceding three events. The programme was I
varied. The gem of the performance wm the I
second mov.-imnt of Beethoven's Sonata, op. |

A BIG PRICE FOB
A SCHOOL SITE
Four Thousand Five Hun
dred Dollars Too Much
Was Paid.
The Mission High School Goes
to Eighteenth and
Dolores.
Price Raised Five Thousand Dollars
Arbitrarily Since Last
Saturday.
The Board of Education, against the
vigorous protests of two of its members,
Thomas Carew and Dr. C. A. Clinton, de
cided la^t Bight to ray $52,500 for a build
ing site, which, up to last Saturday, had
been offered the board for $50,000.
Dr. Clinton said that the property v.as
not worth more than $48,000, but seeing
that opposition was useless for all practi
cal purposes, the board being determined
to pay the sum nrst named, voted with the
majority.
Director Carew nailed his colors to the
mast and went down with the ship, he
being tbe oniy "no' on the final call of
the roll.
The site ir. question was that for the '
proposed new Mission High School, and <
the piece of ground selected was approved ;
of by tbe Mission Improvement Club last
Sunday. On the next day (yesterday) the
owner raised the price from $50,000 to
$55,000.
The following communication, read at
last night's meeting of the board, "ex
plains itselt" :
Gentlemen: I beg to inform you that I re- '
ceived this morning the inclosed letter, that
explains itself. Carrying out its instruction*
I shall be obliged to a<k you the sum of
$55,000, in lien of ,Â«50.000, the former price
of the site I submitted to you, viz.: the north
westerly corner of Eighteenth and Dolores j
streets, having a frontnge of 1114 feat on Dole- i
ros, a frontage oi 39S feet on Eighteenth street
and 393 feet on Lorlaud street.

case you are able to do so, will give you thirty
days' time to close sale. Yours truly.
a. J. Bloch,
For estate of I, F. Bloch, deceased.
Director Barrett thereupon introduced a
resolution pledging the board to pay f52,
--500 for the site, provided that the Cali
fornia Title and Insurance Company
should pass favorably on the title.
Mr. Carew inquired of President Scott
why the price had been raised. Mr. Law
ton had ' tie reel him the lot last Saturday
for $50,000, and he wanted to know why
tbe board had agreed to tack $2500 more
on to it.
The chair requested Mr. Carew to read
the letter and thereby receive eniight
nient.
A faint oior of Doodle seemed to per
vade the room at this stage of the proceed
ing's, and Dr. Clinton moved to deter
action for one week. He believed the
matter to be too important to be l hurried.
He said that in making the motion his
idea was to endeavor to save some money
to i he City. There were some features of
the prorosition that he did not like. It
was a very singular coincidence to his
mind that this property wag offered lor
sale at until Sunday â until after
the Mitsion Improvement Club had met on
that day and decided that they wanted that
paiticular property, which decision was
published in yesterday morning's news
papers. It s'emeu a singular coincidence
ihat the owner should jump the price up
$5000. The speaker knew that there were
many desirable sites in the Mission for a
hinh school, and he objected to payi'ig
any more for this property than its real
value.
The property was divided into thirty
two lots, and he knew that a good roun<l
price would be $1500, or $48,000 for the
whole piece, and lie uad very prara doubls
whether the land would fetch $4d,000 in
the market.
He supposed that the City would have
to }ay more for the land than au individ
ual would; but it was not ripht and he
didn't like it. At the executive meeting
of the board held that afternoon a gentle
hiari hml told them thai the price of one I
site, $35,000. could be cut down to $32,0<')0,
thatoi another siie from $39,000 to $35,000
and on another from $46,000 to $40, C00.
He thought that a fair price fur ihÂ»
property beiore the board would be s4B,ooo,
and even then the board would be pay
inir a high figureâ the rate of $1500 for
each lot.
Dr. Clinton's motion to postpone was
lost by a viva voce vote.
Director MurUock moved to cut down
the pi-ice to $50,000. Hedi:i not like the
idea of the $5000 raise within two days.
"It is not often," he said, "that people
get the full a-king price for property. It
is generally expected that there will be a
drop before ihe property changes hands.
I believ* mat the owner will take it."
Dr. Clinton seconded Mr. Murdock's
amendment. 'Even thin we are paying
too much for it," he said.
Mr. Murdock's motion was lost by ayes
Carew, Clinton, 'Jomte,;McEiroy and Mur
dock; noes â Ambrose, Barrett, Hawley,
Henderson, Knox, So per and Soott.
President Bcott explained his vote on
the ground that his own opinion and that
of several experts was that the site was in
the right piace for the school.
The deciding vote on Director Barrett's
resolution, to pay the owner $2500 more
ti.an tie asked on Saturday, was then put
and leceived eleven ayes â Carew being the
only "no."
At recess Mr. Carew remarked that if
the members of the board were buying a
lot for themselves they wouldn't pay so
much or duv it in that way.
Mr. Carew's change of vote and his
giving notice that at the next meeting he
would move to reconsider were negatived
by tne board reconsidering ttie vote then
an there and repealing it.

close attention, and in his next bienniul
message will recommend the measure to
the lavor:;ble consideration of the Legis
lature. He entertains the belief that the
tract of land at San Quentin can be sold
for a sum sufficient to meet the cost of
constructing the required new buildings
at Folsom.
The cost of maintaining two institutions
of this character falls heavily on the State.
Tne Governor tigures that a large savine
of public money might be effected by a
consol dation of the prisons. In the
manufacture of jute bags and other arti
cles demanding power to move machinery
Folsom is said to present many advan
tages over San Quentin. The cost of iuel
is no small item at tho bay prison. At
Folsom the wruer-powar is ample for all
the purposes of manufacturing.
Again it is contended that the convicts
could be better governed aud disciplined
if they were reinuveu frum the influences
which a large city exerts on a prison. San
Quentin id said to be too near San Fran
cesco.
Senator-elect John H. Dickinson, who
will represent Marin County in the State
Senate for the next two years, has given
some attention to the subject, but is not
sure that the State would be largely bene
fited by the proposed consolidation. ;He
inclines to the belief that there should be
one prison in this region of the State ana
another in Southern California. This plan
would brin-: about a saving in the trans
portation of prisoner*. He is not accu
rately informed as to the sentiments of his
constituents on the proposition to aban
don San Quenlin.
From other sources it is ascertained that
Wai den Aull of Folsom aspires to the po
sition of czar in the central prison. He
dcs-ires that all the prison labor and all
the prisoners of the Slate should be under
his immediate supervision and control.
He is accredited with having performed
excellent work in the development of
power and extension of manuiaciuring fa
cilities at Folsom.
In the line of transportation tiie South
ern Pacific would be benefited by the con
solidation at Folsom. Tnat corporation
control* the only railway leading irom
this City to Folscm. Should the charges,
however, become excessive the State could
employ river steamers to take the prison
ers to fcjac:amento, and the cost for the re
mainder of the distance by rail would not
be creat.
The proposition to consolidate will be
submitted to the Legislature as a measure
of economy. It ia sure to command much
support, as many members view the sug
gestion favorably.
ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS.
The Board of Supervisors Has the Bight
to Create Them When the Pnblio
Benefit !* Involved.
City and County Attorney Creswell ren
dered an opinion yesterday, at the in
stance of the Board of Supervisors, in
which he held that the board has the right
to create assessment districts for the pur
pose of defraying the cost of public im
provements "whenever the contemplated
w^rk of improvement in the opinion of
thÂ«? City Council is of more than local or
ordinary puolic benelit."
Finishing Iho General Ticket.
The Board of E'ection Commissioners will

CHESHIRE'S LONG
HYPNOTIC SLEEP
Kennedy's Subject in a
Trance at the Bush-
Street Theater.
Thousands View the Slumberer
During the Day and
Last Night.
Toctors Take Temperature and Pus\
but Each Individual Observer Has
His Private Opinion.
Fully 5000 interested persona visitecf the
Bush-street Theater yesterday and last
night to view George Cheshire, alleged to
be in a hypnotic trance. He was placed
in the condition in whicu he reposes at 9
o'clock on Saturday night, and all the
evidences seem to indicate that he has
lain on the stage ever since undisturbed,
except medirat men have interposed
to tak;- 1 note of l)is> condition.
All kinds of opinions regarding Che
s. ire's condition have been expressed.
Many skeptics have boldly alleged that
the performance is a "fake," pure and
simple, in spite of the fact that the slum
berer has never shuddered, winked or
given signs of waking when needles have
been thrust through his ears and. into his
cheek. During the day a number of doc
tors called, took his pulse and respiration,
and made comments on his condition.
Almost all found tne temperature abso
lutely normal and tbe pulse slightly slow.
"Cheshire will remain as he is," said
Kennedy last night, "unless I awaken
him. until 10 o'clock nest Sunday night,
at wnicn tiaic any one can awaken him,
or he will arise of his own accord. I can
not understand how this is done any more
than you can, but it is a fact tl\at the im
pression I convey to the hypnotic will re
main and no power outside of myself can
phase him."
The subject was given beef tea twice
yesterday and was turned on his side to
| prevent any injurious effects from lying
too lons in one position. Aside fromthis
no changes were made in his position. He
| lies on his back most of the time in a po
! sition which appears to the ordinary ob-
J server to be a deep slumber. Doctors pro
| nounce the condition one of profound
sleep. Tliey iudge of this by the respira
tion, puise and temperature.
''Cheshire will p;obably lose ten to fif
teen pounds of weight during the week,"
said Kennedy last night, "beyond wnich
Ido not think any marked cnauges will
be noticed. When the entire matter is

Now Young George Lang
ford Says (he Month
Was Enough.
His Father, Who Has Been
Appointed His Guardian,
Seeks a Divorce.
The Wife Says She Met Her Husband
at a Ball Three Months
Ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Caxl,)
908 Broadway, Nov. lb". )
George F. Langford, a young man
nearly 19, has been married nearly three
months and now wants a divorce; his
father also wants letters of guardianship
over the youth and Mrs. Langlord wants
her husband to keep her. So far the wife
is ahead, for the court to-day ordered the
young husband to p&y $16 belore Thurs
day to enable her to conduct the defense
to the divorce case.
Last August Mrs. McCarger, who was a
widow waitress in Santa Cruz, went to
San Francisco for a holiday. While there
she aitended a ball and met George F.
Langford, who fell desperately in love
with her. Before a weet passed he was
accepted and ne went after a license,
Bweanng that he was 22 years of age.
He showed the license to the lady, but
When sue karnea that he had committed
perjury in order to obtain it she refused
to be married. But the boy's mother jjave
her consent aud t c marriage took p:ace.
After the ceremony the young coupie
went to the llusss House, uud the second
day of their stay young Langford told his
wife that he was without funds and that
she wouÂ»d have to look out for herself.
Mrs. Langiord Jr. went back to Santa
Cruz and resumed her waiting. Soon alter
fche and her husband separated. Lang
ford's father next applied for letters of
guardianship over his boy, and when they
were granted he applied for a divorce and
cited the wile's conduct as the reason why
it should 0e granted.
Mrs. Lungfora went on the stand to-day
and testified that her conduct had been
above reproach, and that sue had been
compelled since her niarriate to earn
her own living. Sue said she has lately
been making paper-bags for a San Fran
cisco concern. Sue can earn $1 00 a day
by makint; about 2500 oa,.'?.
The young husband testified that he
earned about $20 a. month by working in a
foundry. The case went over tul Wednes
day to allow Mrs. Langford to brin^ wit
nesses irom Santa Cruz, and her husband
was ordered to give Her $10 for this pur
pose.

IT WAS A REBUKE,
Manager Britton's Opinion of the Elec
tion â Alameda Artigti I'repurinjj
to Entertain Their Friends.
AL.AMEDA, Cal., Nov. 16. -John A.
Britton, president ol the Oakland Gas and
Heat Company, does not iike the pros
pects of having an opposition in this city
in the form of a company which will
virtually be turned into the city's owner
ship. In a letter to tne press of the city
he says some very pointed things. Among
' them are the following paragraphs:
It occurs to me in this connection to say
that It would seem as If toe peopie oi Alamedn
hid bvren sufficiently punished by municipal
ownership not to attempt to burden them
selves with additional taxatiou, and such, I
firmly believe, would be the voice of ihe
people if the matter should be submitted to
them.
The fad of municipal ownership Is only
â made possible by the active workings of a few
individuals who see in it opportunity to sell
apparatus, to create new and profitable posi
tions lor themselves or friends, or to depreci
ate existing vaiues. That there is no merit in
the iad, your townspeople nave ample evi
dence.
On the 3d of November the people of these
United Kates determined by their votes that
they would have nothing; to do with mat
element of society which is seeking to tear
down aud destroy that which others have
built up. .
fcuih.it secm3 to me, is the evident inten
tion of the clas* -of men who are agitatiug
mun.cipnl ownership, particularly a new gas
company in your < iiy.

CHINESE MAKE MERRY.
They re Given the Benefit of Creil ts,
Alth >ueh United State-i Prisoners.
OAKLAND, Cal., N v. 16.â There was a
grand Chinese jubilat o:i at the County
Jail this evening. S x Chinese who were
looking forward to another month of im
prisonment were suddenly released, and
the jail was not* large enough to contain
their joy.
Six months aeo half a dozen Chinese
were arrested for violating the law-) regu
lating hydraulic mining. They were con
victed, and Judge Morrow sentenced the m
to receive six months apiece at the Ala
meda County Jail.
The point of law has been raised as to
whether United States prisoners are en
titled to credits sue > as can be earned by
State prisoners. It was decided to-d.iy
that they are, and hence one month was
cut off the sentence of the Chinese.
A BLOW ENDS IN DEATH.

OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 16.â Matilda
Coldeweiu, a 15-year-old girl, died sud

a blow on the head which she received
some months ago.
While visiting relatives in Oakland last
summer she was ttrack heavily on the
head with a broom handle by a cripple.
She .--uffered severely at the time, but ap
parently recovered and went home.
On the day of her ueath she attended to
her duties as usual and in the evening
complained of sickness. Violent convul
sions followed, and before a physician
reached the house she was dead. Ma-
j tilda was born at the home where she
I died and was a great favorite in that sec
tion.
The funeral was largely attended by
young folks, and Rev. E. Reid delivered
a very impressive funeral sermon.

V ithdraw.

1" ;mcisco attorney and a member of the
church for eleven years, is the leader,
have signified their intention of with
drawing ana layinir the foundation of a
"Churcu oi" the Nazarene."' Mr. Girvin
says:
While Christian perfection or scriptural holi
ness is one oi the fuudamenta. doctrines of
Methodism I do not think it is sufficiently em
phasized in the pulpits of that organization,
uor do preachers, tnemselyes all aglow with
the experience, present it constantly and
| earnestly as the immediate privilege and
j spiritutil ncriiaio of all believers. I am in
favor oi regular weekly meetings for the pro
motion of this i;race of Heart purity. I believe
in the imminent, premlllennial coming of
Chris:, and while no one is authorized to fix
thecjate of this glorious event it id likely lo
occur tit auy time.
While I urn more firmly established than
evtr iv the great fundamental doctrines as to
which all the evangelical churcht-s agree, I
feel that there are many points in which these
churches err and regarding which they depart
from the plain teaching* of the Bible.
As regards church polity, I do not believe in
episcopacy, presiding el iers, two orders of the
ministry und the powers winch pertain to
thsm and which go to make of Methodism a
great hierarchy and ecclesiastical system.
8 i fur as methods are concerned, I am op
posed to all Â«orts â¢ f worldly entertainments
in church bu Id ings, and object to church tes
tivais, bazaar-, fairs and other similar noney
making.schemes. These are all compromises
with evil, though doubtless well meant gener
al, y, and bring the professed followers of
Christ into deserved contempt. The gospel
way to raise money is for Christians to put
their hands into tneir own pockets and take
out whitt is needed for the legitimate work of
the churoh, which should consist in preaching
the gospel all over the world and helping the
fioor and needy. I do not believe iv cosiiy and
uxurlously appointed Â« church buildings.
These costly buildings tend to feed the pride
and vanity of those who build them, make
''religion" unnecessarily expensive, k-aU often
to competition among the sects as to which
sha.l have the finest church and keep the poor
away lrom the public worship oi God.
Oi course 1 do not believe in "paid" choirs.
I The money which they. cost can be much better
I spent in the genuine Christian work of preach
: ing the gospel and helping ihe poor and needy.
i I think, too, that a large proportion of preach
ing should be done oy laymen, who sustain
themselves in some secular pursuit, and nre
thus in a position to preach without financial
compensation.
And now a word or two as to what I intend
to do. The Church of the Nazarene wa< organ
ized in Los Angeles a year ago last October,
with Rev. P. F. Uresee and Rev. J. P. Widney
as its pnstors. It has now a membership of
nearly 350, and his enjoyed a continual re
vival during Ita whole history. It has built a
plain wooden structure on a leased lot, fcitn-
Htea in a poor quarter of the city. With a seat
ing capacity oiÃoo.il is generally filled. It
â¢mploya a deaconess, who with its other mem
bers engages in house tq h Â»i;se visitution, car
ing for th â  poor and comiorting the dying. It
conducts open-air meetings, cottage meetings,
street mcc ungs and other evaureiin tic services.
I hope to be pririieged to take part In the
organization of another cong egation or so
| ciety of the Church of the Naz rene in Berke
ley. Rev. Mr. Bicsee will conduct a ten days'
meeting here, probably next January, with
such organization as one of Its objects.

Oakland Office Fan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 16. f
Within the past year two of the largest
warehouses at LiVermore have been
burned with the whole of their valuable
contents, and Mr. Seller, one of the pro
prietors, is not at all satisfied that the
conflagrations were the result of accident.
Some few months ago one of the largest
warehouses owned by Anspacher Bros,
was destroyed and the loss approximated

it and it was regarded as a mystery. Last
week the almost new corrugated iron
warehouse met with a similar fate. Out
of 2234 tons of the choicest hay not a
straw was paved.
Ten minutes before the fire broke out
the night watchman, Dan Smi h, passed
the buildir.p and noticed nothing unusual.
As soon as the fire was discovered it
spread so rapid*y that ail efforts were di
rected to save the adjoining property. The
loss was $1900.
"These fires are mysterious," said Mr.
Seller. "This firm has been in business in
tbis valley for nearly thirty yearÃ, and
within the last year two of its finest ware
houses have been mysteriously burned. I
have no opinion to express regarding their
origin, because I cannot even guess how
they were started."
Dun Smith, the watchman, Â«ffers a
theory if the work were done by firebugs.
"Not more than ten minutes before the
aiarm sounded," he said, "I examined
the doors of the warehouse and they were
all closed and locked. If the work were
done by firebugs it must nave been ac
complished by boring through the cur
rugated iron wall at the north end of the
building. The dropping of a lighted
match insiua would have done the work.
Lit is a mystery to me how that fire
Istarted."
There is a eood deal of uneasiness in
the neighborhood and the opinion is gen
eral that firebug i are at work and that
they had a pariicuiarspiie against the An- -
Eachers. Tae burned buildinjr was only
uilt in May last at a cost of $5500 and was
one of the largest hay warehouses in the
State. Some special detective work is be
ins done to try to discover if possible
the incendiary.

office of the company in this City, super
seding C. E. Bray, formerly the local

father, and is no longer in the employ of
the company. As soon as he has con
cluded the transfer of the office to his suc
cessor he will leave for the East.

POLK STREET'S
UNSIGHTLY "HUMP"
That Is the Name Given
to the Chestnut-Street
Hill.
Improvement Clubs to Join and
Get a New Street-Grading
Law.
An Amen'mrnt to the Vroormn Act
Will Be Presented to the Next
Legislature.
A well-attended meeting of the Polk
street Improvement Club was held last
night at 1605 Polk street, L. H. Kohn pre
siding and Robert Dross officiating as
secretary.
An invitation had been sent out to the
Supervisors - elect ana to Mayor -elect
James D. Phelan to attend the meeting,
but the latter alone responded ana en
couraged those present in their work.
President Kohn stated that the object of
the meeting was to consider and perfect
necessary arrangements in conjunction
with property-owners and others for the
immediate ODening and grading of Polk
street from Greenwich to .Bay street.
He read the letter sent yesterday to the
Board of Supervisors by City and County
Attorney Creswell stating the opinion
that the board bad the power to establish
an as essment district for the grading of
Polk street from Greenwich to Lombard.
The board may make the expeise of such
work or improvement chargeable upon a
district, which it shall declare to be the
district benefited by said work or im
provement.
The particular section alluded to is the
big hill, or "hump," as all th^ speakers
called it, which lies directly in the line of
view which, if unobstructed, would open
a Polk-street vista to the bay.
Ex-Supervisor Denman stated that he
believed it advisable to petition the Board
of Supervisors not to award any contracts
for the work until a change of crade has
been decided upon. It had been his ex
perience that one property-owner object
ing to the change of grade was sufficient,
according to law, to obstruct the work so
muc i desired by all the others. Hence,
he thought, the grade question s ould
first be settled, especially that it would be
cheaper to move the hill and dump it
where it would be of most advantage in
making the grade than it would be to first
tear it away and find a location for the de
bris, only to have to oart it back afterward
at a double expense.
Mr. Denmau believed that provision
should also be made to compensate prop
erty-owners who would be damaged by
the change of grade, but that compensa
tion should not be on inflated or fictitious
damages.
\V. B. Bradbury spoke in the same
vein.
On motion W. B. Bradbury of the Polk
street Improvement Ciub, H. E. .Law of
the Van Ness Improvement Club and W.
Fries, a property-owner, were appointed a
committee of three to consider the matter
and formulate such petitions to the Super
visors aa would meet the requirements.
Judge H. C. Dibble stated that he would
suggest that an amendment to the Vroo
man street act be framed by the commit
tee, so that henceforth it would be impos
sible for one obstructionist in a district to
stoD the improvements proposed by all the
others. He promised that he would pre
sent the amendment and work for its pas
sage by the next Legislature.
Mayor-elect James D. Phelan, president
of the improvement clubs of this City,
told bow he was interested in the work
mapped out by the assemblage.
"A stronger and more effective power
can be brought to bear upon the Super
visors," he said, "by concerted action as
conducted by improvement clubs, than by
trusting to the individual work of one
man elected to the board from the district
or ward."
Mr. Phelan invited those present to at
tend the general meeting of the improve
ment clubs next Wednesday.
"I believe that If you gentlemen suc
ceed in your worthy endeavor to open
up Polk street the Federal Government
will open up a park surrounding the old
lortifications at Black Point. In this way
the single improvement you are contem
plating would be doubled and the entire
City would be benefited."
Mr. Terrill, an old-time resident of the
district, followed the same lines of the
other speakers, adding that owin to the
"hump" the north end of Polk street was
thirty-five years behind the Mission in
improvement.
T. V. O'Brien and J. G. McGovern also
spoKe.
The Charge Dismissed.
Charles Sydney O'Brien, the author of "Ma
Angeline." appeared before Judge Low yester
day to answer a charge of assault *ith a
deadly weapon. The complaining witness was
Jumes McAt.drews, a b >aunan, who was
stabbed by O'Brien during a row in a restau
rant on Pacific street. It was shown that
w'Brlen acted in self-defense aud the Judge
dismissed the case.

Supervisors Say They Will
Take the Matter Into
Court.
And Have It Judicially Deter
mined Whether They Are
County O.ficers.
If They Are the Recent Election Was
Null and Void so Far as They
Are Concerned.
Mayor-elect Phelan announced yester
day that he would not take any steps
toward the appointment of the committee
of one hundred on the charter Dropoaition
until after the holidays. Then he would
call a meeting of leading representatives
of all the political parties and of the op
ponents and proponents of the proposed
new charter and obtain from them an ex
pression of opinion as to the City re
quirements in the way of a charur before
he would take any action in the matter of
the appointment of the committee of one
hundred.
Further than this Mr. Phelan declined
to say.
Supervisor Dimond denied yesterday
that ne has anythine to do with the pro
posed hold-over Supervisorial contest and
asserted that he knew neither the first nor
the last thing about it. He added that he
was not in the combine of Supervisors
who were taking measures to obtain an
opinion of the court to the effect that the
Supervisors were County officers and as
such entitled to hold tor two yvars longer.
Supervisor King said that he and sev
eral other members of the board were de
termined to have the matter tested, first
before the Superior Court and if the judg
ment of that court went against them
they would taKe the matter to the Su
preme Court.
They have engaged the law firm of

TO MAKE WAR ON DIVES.
Judge Groezinger Denounces Them and
Sends a Long Communication to
the Grand Jury.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger, who
occupied the bench in Judge Campbell's
court yesterday, has started a crusade
against the dives on the Barbary Coast,
his action having arisen from a case that
came before him.
Frank Wilson, a sailor, was charged
with an assault to commit murder.
He had been arrested for stabbine S. J.
Smith, the bartender of the Bella Union
saloon, but had to be first taken to the
Receiving Hospital to have a scalp wound
dressed.
According to the evidence of the prose
cution, Wilson and a friend were drunk,
and were raising a disturbance in the
3aloon, when b'mith told them to be quiet.
Without any provocation Wilson pulleil
out a knife and stabbed Smith in the
che-t.
According to Wilson and his 'companion
they drank a pood deal in the saloon, and
finally both fell asleep.
They recovered their senses about 7
o'clook and both found they had been
robbed, Wilson of $4 60 and his companion
of $4 70. Wilson demanded his money
from the bartender, but he and tho official
bouncer set upon the sailor and struck
him over the head with a club. Wilson
drew his knife in self-defense ana stabbed
Smith. The sailors said they had been
drugged.
Justice Groezinger said he had no hesi
tation in dismissing the case. He was
sorry that Wilson had not killed the peo
ple who robbed him. Such places were a
disgrace to the City, and should be sup
pressed. He announced his intention of
bringing the matter to the attention of
the Grand Jury.
Later he sent a long communication to
the Grand Jury reciting the facts as
brought out in the evidence and conclud
ing as follows:
I am satisfied that the sailors testified
to the truth and that they were drugged and
robbed in the Bella Union dive, Kearny street.
1 desire to state that such a place is a disgrace*
to San Francisco and it should be wiped out.
There are doubtless others, and I am willing
to co-operate with the members of the Grand
Jury in seeing that the license ot the Bel a
Union is revoked and that all similar places
are closed. The testimony in the Wilson casa
was taken down by the shorthand reporter
ana I snail be glad 10 place it, together with,
any other information at my command, before
you.

READY FOR PEACE.
I,onÂ£ -Stand ing Kate Differences Be*
tween Hero and Portland to
Be Adjusted.
In furtherance of the announced pur
pose of the Southern Pi-cilic Company and
the Oregon Railroad 3nd Navigation Com
pany to patch up their rate war on freight
between here and Portland, B. CampbHl,
traffic manager of the latter company, ar
rived here yesterday from Portland. He
vras accompanied fay W. H. Hurl hurt,
pereral pas3enÂ«er aecnt ol the Orecon
Rjti'.roaaand Navigation Company.
Mr. Campbell spent the day at "the local
offices of ti.e company, looking into ihe
details of the questions whicii are likely to
arise before an adjustment is effected. As
soon as he has the local situation well in
hand it is understood he will have a con
ference with J. C. Stubbs. traffic manager
of the Southern Pacinc Company.
In view of the fact that for more than
three years both companies havo suffered
great loss in the rate war they have waged
against each other it is believed thatÂ°an
eariy settlement of the existing differ
ences will result.
At present the average freight rate be
tween here and Portland is |1 per ton.
Before the present difiiculty arose the
rates averaged from $2 50 to $15 a ton. It
is not expected tha; rates will be restored
to anything like the^e figures, but some
material advance will follow the declara
tion of peace.
A BOON TOE JOBBERS.
New York No Longer to Have a Monop
oly of Trade.
By the new schedule of rates from the
East, established by the Southern Pacific
Railroad Coinpanj-, California jobbers will
have a chance to purchase in other mar
kets besides Kew York. The new rates yo
into effect to-day.
The freight rule from Boston, Philadel
phia and other Drincipal poir.ts on the
Atlantic seaboard will be the same as
from New York on the leading commodi
ties, with a minimum rate, however, of 75
cents the 100 pounds.
An Evening With Dickena.
Dan O'Connell lectured to a fair house last
night at Union-square HaU on "An Evening
With Dickens." The lecturer was introduced
by "Uncle George" Brom.ey. Mr. O'Connell
proceeded to portray the great English novel
ist in lour roiesâ the convivial, the pathetic
ihe sentimental and the merely descriptive
The pathetic Mdc of Dickens' nnuifold nature
w*(> illustrated with 'Little Xea" and the con
vivial wit_ "Plckwici." During the course
of tbe evening vocal selections were rendered
bjr Mra. Grace Aylward and Mr. Jones.
betting at odds of 9 to 10, and taking tbe lead:
in the stretch, won hard ridden a neck in
front of Excuse, with Cadenza, a 30 to 1
shot, third. . â¢
Charley Sanders' Racine colt Alazan,
was backed down from 8 to 5 to evens to
pull of the five-lurlong scramble for two
year olds, but after racing out in front
with Roltaire died away in tho final run,
finishing fourth. Rosclle, played from 10
io 4% to 1, finished strong ana won easily
by t_ree lengths. Roltaire was nipped
out the last jump for the place by
February.
The Burns & Water house stable turned
out quite a likely youiigter in the race
following, another "five-furlong dash for
members of the two-year old division, in
Osric 11. He sauntered over to the post a
5 to 1 chance, and catching Tempestuous,
the leader, a sixteenth lrom the wire, beat
Purser's gelding out a neck in 1:02 W.
Celeste, the 12 to 5 favorite, was virtually
left at the posÂ«t.
The best run of the day was a mile
selling affair, with a Held of seven start- |
ing. The betting at post time favored j
Red Glen, who was backed, from 7 to 5 |
down to evens. Kamsin, who opened at
the same odds, receded to 9 to 5 in most of I
the books. The balance of the starters re
ceived slight support. Carrying eighty
eight pounds and getting away a bad last, j
Maxey on Salisbury II ran around his j
lield and leading to within a few yards of i
the wire was beaten out but a nose by j
Kamsin owing to Jones' superior riding. |
Two Cheers was third. Red Glen was j
pocketed through the stretch.
The linal six furlong sprint was taken i
by Trappean with 9 to 2 about him in the j
books, who came fast through the stretch ]
and winning without trouble from j
Howard. Palomacita,' the favorite, ran
poorly.

DR. MARC LEVINGSTON ENDS
THE BIG FAIR CONTENTION
By a Masterly Strategic Move, He Allows the
Earlier of the Two Wills to
Go to Probate.
With Only the Administrator's
Fees at Stake Further Liti
gation Was Held Useless.
P. M. DELMAS' SCATHING WOEDS
Mrs. Craven's Suits to Recover Under
the Deeds From Senator Fair
Still to Be Pushed.
And after years of preparation, the as
sembling of a library of legal documents,
motions, demurrers, and all the rest of it,
working upward toward the climax of a
spectacular and theatrical trial at court,
the gathering together of the forces of [
both sides, a cloud of witnesses, a panel of |
jurors ready for the beginning of the bat- j
tie, the great Fair will case lite a dissolv- I
ing view passed away in an hour before
Judge Slack yesterday morning.
D. M. Delmas of Delmas & Shortridge,
on behalf of Marc Levingston, withdrew
his petition for the probate of the famous !
pencil will, and in stating his reasons ;
made a scathing arraignment of the chil- j
dren in the contradictory positions they j
Lave taken.
And thus ended tne great contest of the ;
Fair will. Once entered upon the trial i
â would have dragged its slow length
through half a year, perhaps. It was dis
missed by this quiet process in less than
an hour, and the Fair will of the 21st is
now fixed and confirmed.
This, however, does not by any means
dismiss the litigation in which the Fair
estate has become involved since the Sena
tor's death. Mrs. Craven still claims the
half million dollars' worth of property
under the deeds alleged to have been
given her by Senator Fair. The suits for
recovery of the property will, say her at
torneys, be pusned as vigorously as possi
b!e. The hali-dozen cross-suits incident
to that claim are also pending.
In withdrawing his petition for probate
of the pencil will Dr. Levingston, through
his attorneys, Delmas & Shortridge, re
views the changing attitude of the heirs
and their attorneys concerning that docu- j
ment. The pai>er, although using no ad
jectives and merely stating the, history of
their relationships to it out of their own j
mouths, still constituted such an arraign- ;
ment of the other side as caused the little
army sitting there at the counsel table
visible uneasiness under Delmas' cold, in
cisive reading.
In explanation of why he (Dr. Leving
ston), the executor of the will, should
withdraw his petition instead of going for
ward wiib. the fight for its probate, he tod
the story of how the heirs had first pro
duced the will, asked for its probate, and
then afterward, one by one, withdrew
that petition and, one by one again, ar
rayed themselves in opposition to it, leav
ing him alone io present its claim to the
court.
He held that it would be in bad taste for
him to insist upon tho probate ot a will
wliich was opposed by all the heirs under
that will. The heirs had tiie millions of
the Fair estate to back them in their op
position to him. Success or failure on his
part meant a large outlay of money which
he did not feel justified in making. For
these reasons, while still holding lirmly to
his belie! in the validity of the will, he
withdrew his petition for its probate.
Incidentally, too, he said that failure to
establish the validity of the pencil will
would work a hardship to Mrs. Nettie R.
Craven, who presented the will, and
whose suits to recover under two deeds
lrom Senator Fair for very valuable prop- I
erty are now pending.
â \Vhen Deliuas ceased reading George j
Knight immediately asked for judgment !
under tne withdrawal and for the dismis- j
eal of the petition.
Judge Slack gave judgment.
Garret McEnerney immediately called
for the admission to probate of the wili
of the 121stâ the trust will.
Delmas said thnt he was the only one
\rho had objected to the probate and he
would withdraw that objection.
Judge Paterson asked for the probate
Upon behalf cf the minor children.
The will was admitted to probate with
out more ado.
Judge Slack called attention to the fact
that there were forty jurors who had been
summoned and who must be paid. Under
a rule of the court this pay must be leviea
upon the parties withdrawing the suit
he would not allow it to De levied against
the estate.
Garret McEnerney and others interested
for the trustees of the will of the 21st
seemed disposed to argue against the ap
plication of the rule in tnis case. Al
though the court would not allow this it
r-is understood tnat they and not Dr. Lev
ingston paid the bill.
George Knight seemed to think this was
disposing of the big case too easily and
, also was fretting under the tone of Del
mas' statement of withdrawal, for he in
terrupted the proceedings to say to the
court: "We stand here ready, your
Honor, to demonstrate that this' pencil
will is a forcery."
â¢'The matter is all disposed of," said
McEnerney.
"But if the court wants lignt on the
subject â " said Knight.
"The petition is dismissed," said the
court, quietly. "Are there any bonda re
quired of the executors?" asked the court
of McEnerney.
"No bonds," was the reply. "The

At the office of Delmas Shortridge the
following statement of the situation was
made:
The central idea involved in the proceedings
to-day was that it would have been idle for
Dr. Levlngston to have insisted upon the pro
bate of this will, the genuineness 01 which
ho has never doubted.
Before this will was brought forward the
children of Senator Fair were confronted with
a trust will. 'obnoxious, by its provisions, to
them. The pencil will was then brought for
ward by them, and at that time, so great was
their anxiety to have the trust will set aside,
that before they had seen the pencil will they
agreed among themselves to pay to Mrs.
Craven half a million dollars, to settle all 01
her claims against the estate, provided the
will of which she told them was Pennine.
After they had seen It they were fully con
vinced of its genuineness, and did not rest
their opinion upon a fancied similarity of the
writing of the will with that of their father,
but submitted it to every expert in handwrit- j
ing in San Francisco, and to the different bank
clerks and business men who were acquainted
witn Hair's habits of writing.
For months afterward they constantly as
serted its genuineness, and no" later than this
morning they hoped that the pencil will
would be pressed for. probate by Dr. .Leving
ston. They were not sure that the decision of
Judge Slack declaring the trust of the trust
will void would be upheld by the Supreme
Court.
We have learned that it has teen: stated to
day that an arrangement has been made with
the trustees named in that will under which
no appeal will be taken from Judge Slack's de
cision. After that decision was rendered
Charles L. Fair, thinking the decision was
final and seeing a way by which he might
avoid the promised payment to â  Mrs. Craven,
attacked tne pencil will. He has never been
fully joined in this attack by his sisters. Their
active supDort of the pencil will was not with
drawn until very recently. j
It has been stated that the action of Dr. Lev
ingston was an evidence of compromise on his
part with the children of Senator Fair. This
is absolutely untrue.
it has also been stated that his action was
prompted by lack of faith in the genuineness
Of that will, and that it was a precursor of a
similar withdrawal of Mrs. (raven's support
of the deeds. This is equally untrue.
Opposed by all of the heirs and devisees,
with the Fair millions at their command no
jury, however honest it may have been, could
have found a verdict in favor of Dr. Leving
ston, who would have appeared to be fighting
only for the comparatively small fees to which
he would be entitled as one of three execu
tors. The expense of the fight would necessa
rily have had to be borne by him, with almost
certain defeat at the end of a long and expen
sive fight.
More than this, he recognized that, while
Mrs. Craven was not directly interested in trie
will, a verdict against the will would have
been disastrous to her in eniorcing her rights
under the deed*.
He did the only right thing which he could
do under all 01 the circumstances, and with
drew his petition for the probate of the pencil
will.
The claims of Mrs. Craven under the deeds
â will be pressed with the utmost vigor. - -

In the Superior Court of the State of Cali
fornia, in and for the City and County of San
Francisco.
In the matter of the estate of James G. Fair,
deceased.
In the matter of the contest of the probate of
the will of said James G. Fair, deceased, bearing
date September 24, 1894, and propounded for
probate by Marc Levingston, named therein as
executor.
In taking in this proceeding a step which, If
unexplained, might bo either misunderstood
or misconstrued, I deem it proper to state the
reasons which impel me lo the course which I
am about to pursue. I do so with the less
doubt of the propriety of such an explana
tion, since an executor, from the moment he j
appears in an estate, is, in a certnin sense, a
servant of the court and under obligation to
render it an account of his conduct.
It will be my aim to set forth in this state
ment how, having originally joined the chil
dren of the late Senator Fair in their petition
for the probate of his last will, I may now con- I
sistently follow them in their withdrawal |
without being thereby Impliededly held to re^ '
pudiata said will, or in any manner to sanc
tion or approve the reasons by which they are
apparently influenced,
James G. Fair died on the 28th of December
1894. A few days after his death there was
presented here a paper, dated the 21st day of
September of the same year, purporting to be
his last will. Accompanying this paper was a I
petition of the lour persons therein named as I
executors and trustees, praying toritsprobate '
This instrument has commonly been known
as the trust will. '%';/:
That the provisions of this testament were
distasteful to the children of the deceased is a '
matter of public notoriety. So outspoken was
their dissatisfaction that it was openly stated '
that the trust feature of the will was in antag- I
onism with the settled and â¢ repeatedly pro
claimed purposes of the deceased; and no con
cealment was made of the grave doubts enter
tained that the will was fraudulent and spu
rious. It was also publicly declared that the
will should be contested.
On the 7th of February, 1895, one of the
counsel for the children, as reported in the
Chronicle of the next day, made the following
statement here:
We do not allow this will (the trust will) to go
to probate without a contest. : An opposition will
be filed. - * â¢ * Before two weeks, or at the ex
piration of that time, a contest or an opposition
will be filed in this matter. . ""
On the 2d of March of the same year one of
the attorneys for Charles L. Fair, as reported
in the Chronicle of the following day, said" in
open court:
1 I will state at the outset that It is the deslro and
intent of Charles' L. Fair to contest the document
that was filed In this court purporting to be. the
last will and testament of his father, James
Graham Fair.
- in the Examiner of March 18 one of the at
torneys for the daughters .of the deceased
made the following statement:
- There will be no quibbling or trickery about this
matter. Instead, a straight and fair contest will
be made. â¢ â¢ â¢ Ido not think the trial will be
a long one. We go Into court to-morrow fully pre
pared and shall push affairs to a quick conclusion.
The time necessary in which to put In evidence
will not be long: the argument will be short. We
shall ask for no further delays, nor will delays be
tolerated unless absolutely necessary. ;
While matters were in this condition and
the children were' preparing thus to attack
the trust will, 011 the 18th- of March, 1895. a
new will, written, dated and signed wholly by
the hand of the deceased, was presented here.
In bringing it into court one of tho attorneys
for the daughters, Theresa A Oelrich* and
Virginia Fair, made the following statement:
In this matter, shortly after the death of Senator
Fair, reports r.-ar he* the ears of his children that
their fattier had made a ho.< graphic will. 'â¢ These
reports were followed up, and in several Instances
found to c-ime from Senator Fair himself. It was
learned that he had told different person* that he
had made a will, lie told them that he - had
written the will himself, and a so tioir he had dis
posed of his property, .-parch was made, for this
will, but jus. win re ii had- been f1Â«-po-itecl it was

It was her duty to give this .will to the children of I
senator Fair, she gave it up. <
Immediately after Menaior Fair's death. In fact
the very next day. a will whs filed which this lady
presumed was the lan will and testament of Sena
tor air, and shÂ» paid no more attention to the
will In her possession until the will filed here was
sto.en lrom the office of the County Clerk. Then
when the papers were full of that sensational
event she looked at the will in her possession and,
to her surprise, I . nd that it wns dated three days
after me one, thai Lad been stolen. On the Im
pulse of the moment she sVnt the will out of the
jurisdiction of thin court, and It, was only after we

This will. was accompanied by a petition for
its probate, in which it was stated that:

has jurisdiction of tbe estate of said deceased.
The petition contained a prayer that:
A time and place may be fixed for the hearing of
the application * * * that s^ld will mny be
admitted to probate us the last will aud testament
of said James G. Fair, deceased.
This petition bore the autograph signatures
of tne three children â C. L. Fair, Theresa Alice
Oelrichs nnd Virginia Fairâ and also those of
all their attorneys and counsel
The genuineness of this document was
vouched for, not only by the solemn manner
in which it was brought into court aud the
i formal petition for its probate, but Also by
many contemporaneous interviews published
in the daily press by the children, their friends
and their legal advisers.
In the Examiner of March 19, 3895. the day
after the will was presented to the court, one
of the attorneys for the daughters is quoted as
having said:
I The three children havel joined In a petition for
i the probate of ibis will, and ihey are a unit In
, their judgment that it is gmulne. The girls recoe-

On the same df.y one of the counsel of Charles
j L. Fair mode the following statement to a rc
| porter of the Kxaiuiner:
Mrs. Craven was up to Sacramento In the inter
est of the 'leachers' pension bill, and she dropped

In The Call of the same dny, March 19,
1895, another interview with one of the attor
neys for the daughters is reported, In the
course of which he said:
These photoerapulc conies of the will have been
certified to by County I'ltrk furry, who has charge
i of the original, ana every precautiou has been
] taken that notnlnp can occur to prevent tin- pro-
I hate of this will. Mrs. Hasklns, the O'.ber witness
I to the will, Is ft very respectable lÂ»dy who liveo
I with Mrs. Cr.tven.
In tbe same paper, Th" Call of March 19,
1895, one of ihe attorneys for Charles L Fair
is quoted as having said:
The accusation that the will Is a forcery Is ab
surd. Its hisiory Is a little peculiar, but no one
should think fora moment that reputable attor
neys would introduce U into court until they tiud
become thoroughly convinced thai it was genuine.
The names or tbe attorneys fa heiinc the will
ought to haveconsideraole weightâ uarber. Boalt
& Bishop, Lloyd & Wood. Wilson & Wilsi.n, and
my partnÂ»r. Mr. Heggerty, and myself, would
never sanction a forged wil 1 . We investigated it
thoroughly before we became satisfied that It was
genuine and we feel confident that It is.
In The Call of March 20, 1895, one of the
attorneys oi Charles L. Fair is reported to have
said:
The will Is all rlitUt. The late Senator Fair has
been telling all over town that he had made such a
will.
In the same paper Charles L. Fair himself
affirmed the genuineness of the will as foilows:
I think I ought to know my father's hand
writing, and this talk about the will being a forgery
is absurd.
On the same day Richard V. Dey, the trus
tee of the children under their mother's will
is repor ted i:i the same paper to have expressed
him.-ell as follows:
ThÂ« handwriting of the will Is most assuredly
that of the late Mr. Kair, and I don't hesitate to
pronounce the will genuine in every respect I
should be familiar with (senator Fai 's hHndwril-
Mk if JUiybody is. 1 was his secretary from, let
me Bee; anyway it was in the 'tsU'Â», until 18K4 1
understood him thoroughly. We consulted to
gether, dltu-il together, traveled toj;ethir.
There is no 'ioubt In my mind but that the new
document expresses the manner in which the
lal* senator wished to dispose of his estate. It
was just like him to write this new will. It was
his way of doing things. He allowed these execu
tors of the first document filed to think that they
h&a everything their own way, nnd then he went
off and upset the whole matter by writing another
will. Nothing could t>e moie characteristic of the
man.
In The Call of March 21, 1895. one of the
attorneys oi Charles L. Fair vouched for the
genuineness ot this will in the followiug lan
guage :
' lam confident that there Is no other will In ex
istence made later than the one we filed. We are
satisfied of Unit, iw;d also that It Is a genuine one.
We will introduce some proof* of Its genuineness
j that will surprise so ue peop Â»â¢. â¢ We know of all
: the wills recently made by Fair. â  Ooodfellow hai

will Is the last and third Â«rfli senator Fair made in
the last year of his ille. Of course it will tte

ellghts they can on our will and spread - reports of
other wills, -so as to make people belt a will

This will, dated' September 24, 1894, and
commonly called the pencil will, named me as
one of its executors. Apar' lrom my own in
viduar conviction it wou d ill have .become
me to entertain a doubt oi the genuineness of
an instrument thus strenuously avouched and
solemnly sponsored, not only by the children
but by -most eminent and honorable: practi
tioners,' whose "names," toq>:ote the language
of one of them, "ought to have considerable
weight," and none of - whom, surely, "would
j ever sanction a forged will." Acting,- there
fare, in furtherance of their inanilest wishes, I
joined in their . efforts to have , the will pro-
Dated, filing a. petition to that end on the 25 ih
of March. 1895. .- - â - ,--.,;. .:â¢....<â¢.
So resolved did the children then seem to
secure the probate of that will and to remove
every . obstacle from , their path that after
nearly two months of reflection one of them,
acting for the benefit of all, did on the 7th of
May of the same year: file a contest of the
trust will on the ground that:
On, to wit: the 24 h day of September, 1894, an i
three days subsequent to the dale upon which said
alleged Ins; w:ll and testament dated September
21, 1894, purports to have been executed; the said
Jmr.fc* (.raliam .Fair,- deceased, made ana exe
cuted his last wlliand * testament, wherein and
whereby hÂ» revoked all prior wills by him made:
that the said last will. and testament. sÂ» executed
b.- jaid James Graham Fair, deceased, on the l:4 - h
day of t>Â«-p:ember. 1894; was and Is entirely writ
ten, dated and signed by the hand of the caul
James (iraham Fair. ;,-'/: ./,;.â¢ _\:^,, r â¢
The will was further contested on the ground
that its provisions; In so far as they relate. to a
trust, had been procured by fraud and undue
Chiidren Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
I influence, and on that subject the contestant
alleged:
That for along time prior to the making and
I execution 01 said alleged last will and testament,
I divers designing persons, who possessed the trust
and confidence of said deceased, hud the desire
and intent to influence and induce the aforesaid
James Graham Fair, deceased, to make. a last
will and tistament in such form that the estate of
' said James (jraham Fair, deceased, should, after his
i death,- be placed In trust for .1 long period
of time, and that the provisions of said
will should be so arranged thai very
large profits, remunerations mm benefits should
accrue therefrom ' and thereunder to them;
that thereafter and pursuant to tneir aforesaid
d Â»i^n ana intent, the saul pnr ie< combined, con
spire and confederated together for the purpose of
influencing and compelling said James Graham
Fair, contrary to his own wishes and will, bu: pur-
I suant to their wlsht-.i and will, 10 make and execute
I a last will and testament wherein and whereby they
i would be benefited as aforesaid. And to thai end
said conspirators continually urged and pressed
! upon the said Jumes Graham Fair, deceased, that
he make a will containing the identical provisions
j alleged to be contained In tne alleged will, dated
; September 21, 1894. which are herelnabove set
j forth, and herein and hereby contested.
1 hat by reason of the wil lent?â of mind and
; body of the said' Jume* t-rnhiim Fair, deceased,
and of his susceptibility to prejudice and th â¢ In
fluence of those about him, utul by i oaHOn of the
confidential relations existing between the said
i dictated and the said conspirators, ana by reason
I of the aforesaid misrepresentations of said con
; npira ors, the slid James Graham Fair was In
i in â¢it and persuaded against his true wlshe.i and
desires, bat pursuant to the wishes and desires of
said conspirators, to make, execute and insert in
the allvÃi-tl la.<t will and testamen-, dated Septem
ber 21, 189-1 (if, in fact, he rver made or executed
said instrument), each and all of the parts tber-of
hereinabove set forth and here.n and hereby con-
I tested.
The petitioner concluded by praying:
That said alleged â  will, dated September 21, !
1894, be denied probate; â¦ * * that (.he special i
s sues involved In said proceeding be bubmlitea to
a jury, and your petitioner hereby requests and ,
demands a jury trial of the issues luvolved in t-iis
proceeding.-,. ' ._ . .>:.,.â.
The significance and cogency of this, docu
ment as evidence of the conviction then en
tertained by the children that the pencil will
i was the lust will of their father, and that tho
trust will whs not, is manifest from '- the fact
that it was signed by the attorneys and coun
sel of all the children, nnd the lurther fact
that upon his confidence in his ability suc
cessfully to maintain that contestâ that is, to
prove the trust will fraudulent and voidâ the
contestant staked nil he was given by that
will. That instrument, it 'may be remem
bered, coutains a- provision that any one con
-1 testing it should forfeit all rights under it.
[ Charles L. Fair affronted the perils of this for
feiture in full confidence of his ability to
prove thai, will not to De the will of his lather.
On the day preceding this contest one of bis
attorney , as quoted in the Call of May 7,
lS!t.>, had madu the following statement:
! Will we contest the probation of the will of Sep
tember 21 before that of the tilth? You bet we
will â¢ â  â¢ â¢ on. all line* =We will tight them
all along the line from stare to linl-li and will win i
our case yet. We will begin onr tight to-morrow
In earnest, and we will gtVH.tbe others all they
want before, we are through with them. * â¢ *
We will put in our contest to-day and we will show
that the latter will Is the one tin; should tin pro
bated first, II we are permitted.; '.
. In the same connection the remarks of one
of the attorneys of the daughters, made in
open court on the day after the filing of this
contest, mny be here recalled. There was
then pending in court a discussion as to the
appointment of n guardian for young Herman
Oelrichs. The court had appointed to that
position Judge Van K. Paterson. This ap
pointment was strenuously opposed' by one of
the attorneys of the child's mother, who in
sisted- that the father, lit- mi an Oelrichs, was
the proper guardian,' saying: .;:-. -.â -.-â 
It Is monstrous that a high-minded, honorable
gentleman shoii.d have his '.lull! taken from him
aim put In the hunas of a stranger. ' *
To this, Judge Van R. Paterson bad replied,
In substance, that, if Mr. Oulrichs would cm
test the pencil will, there: would be no op
position to his being appointed the guardian
of his own child:
if Mr. Oelrlehs hid done what I conceive to be
his duty, if lie hud 11. Ed a contest of the pencil will, j
I would not interfere with me management of his
son. * â¢ â¢ I think Mr. Oelrichs ought to have
brought Him contest, and. If he had done 'mo, I
would not be here asking to be allowed to make it.
I have subper.aed Mr. uelrichs to come here and
sta c whether he meant to make a contest of the '
pencil will, but as he had to go to -New York on I
Business 1 agreed to take the admission of counsel I
in the matter.
To this invitation to define his and his
clients' attitude in relation to the pencil will,
the mother's attorney replied:
â  The will of ireptember 24 was submitted to Mrs.
Oelrichs,. to her sl-.tT and : to all Interested, ana
they all concurred that It was in -Mr. Fair's writing :
and Is his ill. Believing that," M Mr.. Oelrichs :
does,* he does not believe It Is hi* duty to contest
the will. Jie has exaiilned: the surrounding and
does not believe 1: necesjary to file v contest.
.The court thereupon ordered the statement
of the attorney to be- incorporated as part of
the evidence in the case, and there it remains
to this day. â .. ' â¢â - :-,.. -
Thus did the attorney of 'Mrs. Oelrichs con
sent that her child's guardianship should be
awarded to a stranger rather than, that she or
he .should; for a -.moment, appear- to call in '
doubt the genuineness of the pencil will. . i
Pausing here to cast a backward look upon
the Ills lory of these ; proceedings,, it appears
that, up to this point, the children were in ac
cord upon three thingsâ , that; tne , estate
must be. freed from any trust; secondly, that
the pencil will was genuine, beyond cavil, and
Mrs. Craven, who proJucea it, "a liÂ»Jy widely
and favorably known in this city," : 'a grout
friend. of Senator Fair," and "Mrs. ilaskins,
the other witness to the will, a ; very respecta
ble lady" ; thirdly, that the trustees ana execu
tors named in < the trust will were "designing
persons" and "conspirators," who, having
"cjmbin;d ; and . confederated; together," had
imposed upon the leiiator in order the more
sa:.-ly to plunder his estate. ;â¢â¢ "â¢' â  â -â¢ â â 'â â¢-â  â -,

- About six weeks after the filing of the con
"V 01 th Â« Â«rust will, and, on the 15ih of June,
I8aÂ«j, an action, was instituted in the interest
ot the children -to have - declared - the 1 trust
leaiure of that will void. T â¢â¢-.--* - :-: â :- -
The executors and ,tees , having in their
answer set up and relied upon the .trust will,
L i e 'ih. Fair ned nud swore to an affidavit
in which he !.et lorth on that he did
aeny the genuineness ot the said alleged will
of September 21; 1894"-the trust will :^. .. â 
twin 1 " a [ Â£K* e ot seven months this court, on
nth^.r , C br " arVl 1*96, held that the Irust
real estate, was void.
On the 10th of ; the following month Charles
L " f ! withdr ew hta contest to the trust will,
ana he and his sisters consented that that will
should be granted probate. '
What, it may not be improper here to ask,
were the motives which prompted this con
sent ,}} by, were Charles L. Fair and nis sis
ters willing that an Instrument which he had
under oath denounced as spurious should be
elh - ewm and that the pencil will,
which they had all so often and so solemnly
proclaimea genuine, should be held to be not
the will of their father ? . Why did he and they
agree that a testament should be decreed by
the court to be valid and honest which he had
himself under oath denied the genuineness of
and had charged to be iraudulent and pro
cured to be executed only "by reason of the
weakness of mind and body of the said James
Orahain Fair, deceased, and of his susceptibil- |
ity to prejudice and the influence and artitices I
of those, aDout him, and by reason of the conn- 1
dential relations existing between the said de- I
ceased and the said conspirators, and by rea
sou of the aforesaid misrepresentations of said
conspirators?"
Why did he and they consent that the exe
cutors therein named should administer upon
the estate, when he had, in his contest of this
very will, characterized them as "designing
persons" and "conspirators," who had "con
federated together for the purpose of influenc
ing: and compelling the said Jemes Graham
ralr, contrary to his own wishes and will, but
pursuant to their wishes and will, to make and
execute a last will and testament wherein and
whereby they would be beneilted," and "very
largo profits, remunerations and benefits
should accrue therefrom and thereunder to
them"? . .
g Is it to be believed that the pencil will had
been brought forward merely as an instru- !
mentality to rid the estate of the trust con
tained 111 the trust wtll; that, if the heirs were
unsuccessful in otherwise accomplishing that
object, then, the pencil will was* to be pro
bated; but, if me trust could otherwise be got I
rid of, then the pencil will, regardless of its ;
merits, was to be cast aside and some out- i
standing and possibly onerous obligations in- |
cident to its probate thereby avoided?
Upon this subject it is proper to recall the
utterances of one of the heirs' legal advisers, I
made immediately after the rendition ox the j
court's opinion.
One of the attorneys for Charles L. Fair, on j
Hie very day the decision WBS rendered, had
SHld.as reported in The Call of February 4,
1890 :
We shall now proceed to probate the will with
out the trust clause, and If It shall be admitted to
probate the estate will be distributed direct. y to
the children. - .
The carrying out of this purposeâ the pro
bating of the trust will without the trust
clauseâ would, it might seem, be open to the
objection, among others, ol turning over the
administration of the estate to the designing
persons and conspirators, who, the heirs had
charged, had confederated for the purpose of
practicing n fraud upon their father in order
10 despoil his estate. It is natural to assume
that some method had been found ot mitigat
ing the heirs' original antagonism to these
men.
This assumption might ' perhaps receive
light from the fact Unit on the sth of June,
189(Â», just ten days belore the commencement
of the action to attack the trust clause of the
trust will, the attorneys for Charles L. Fair,
Theresa A. Oelr;chs and Virgin!* Fair signed
a stipulation that the special administrators
of the estateâ the identical "designing per
sons" and "conspirators," who, they had
solemnly averred, had "confederated" for the
purpose of looting the â should "draw
$25,000 each as against their commissions."
Two of the executors and special administra
tors â one-half of the whole number, for there
were but four in allâ had for years been clerks
of the deceased, receiving clerks' salaries.
They had t>erve 1 as special administrators for
live months (from January to June, 1895), and
the heirs agreed that they should receive
therefor #25,000 each.
These facts might perhaps at another time
call for comment. On the present occasion
their only value is to show that the change of
the children's attitude toward the pencil will,
taking place under the circumstances stated,
ought not justly to exercise a controlling in
fluence upon my mind as regards the question
of its genuineness. '
The hope, however, of securing the pro
bating of the trust will was frustrated by the
decision of thu court, made on the 19ih day
of March, 1896, to the effect that the petition
for the probate of the pencil will was entitled
to precedence, and should be set for bearing
on the 27th of the tame month. The pencil
will. bein< thus again Drought to the front,
once more received, for a time at least, the
favorable consideration of all parties in inter
est. On the 23d of the same month one of the
counsel for the children said In an interview
with a reporter of The Call, published in tha
next morning's issue of that paper, "that he
believed tne pencil will to , be. genuine, and
had said so repeatedly."
This view, however, would seem not to have
long prevailed. for on the sth of April, one 01
the attorneys for Charles L. Fair made, In an
interview published In the Examiner of the i
next day, - the following statement: -
We are fighting it (the pencil will) because we
claim it is a forgery, liiin^u forged instrument,
we care not wliai it contains. â 
And iv an interview of the 3 1 of April, pub
lisned in the Keportof that aay, the same at
torney had stated:
I have been opposed to tho penciled will from
the beginning, and intend to fiztu It.
In justification of my declination to follow
the varying opinions of the children
and their legal advisers -touching the
genuineness of the pencil will, it may
not be without interest to note here,
in passing, that the nutnor of this utteranceis
the .-ame gentleman who, on the 10th of
March of the preceding year, had said that
the "rtccusation thnl tho will is a forgery is
absurd," and -my partner, â¢ â¢ *, and myself
would never sanctlo-i n forged will. We inves
tigated it thoroughly before wo became satis
fied that it was genuine and we feel confident
It Is"; and, on the 20th of the same month,
hndsaid: "I am confident there is no other
will in existence made later than the one we
filed. We are satisfied of that iind also that it
is a genuine one. We will introduce some proofs
of its genuineness that will surprise some peo
ple"; and, as late us the (sth of Mny had said:
"Will we contest the probation of the will of
September 121 before that of the 24th? You
bet we will* â¢ â¢ ou nil lines. We will fight
them all along the line from start to finish
and will win our case yet. We will begin our
fight to-morrow in earnest and we will give
the others all they want before we arc through
with them. â¢ * â¢ We will put iv our Con
test to day and we will snow that the later
wili is the on* ttmtshouid be probnted first."
Two days after this repudiation Charles L.
Fair filed over his own signature and that of
his attorneys a contest oi the pencil will de
nying its genuineness. This is the same gen
tleman who on the 19th of Jlarch, 1895, and
said: "I think 1 ought to know m> lather's
handwriting, and this talk about the' will (tho
pencil will) being a lorgery is ab-urd."
This contest was filed within a few days
after it hftd been publicly stated by the press
that Mrs. Craven hnd deeds to valuable prop
erty from Senator Fair and also a marriage
contract.
After theurginfjof endlessdilatory pleas the
argument of wnicii covered a period of five
months, tne two daughters of tne deceased at
lengtn, on the 10th of September. 1890, tiled
their r.n.swer 10 the opposition of Judge Pater
son. This nnswer was signed by all their at
toraeys and counsel. In it they aver that

subject of the genuineness of the pencil will."
Tney deny, however, that that will is not gen
uine and insist that it be granted prob.ue.
So eager did they then seem to have the pencil
will probated that, accompanying their an
swer, was a notice given by them that they
wouid move the court at ones for nn order set
ting the cause for immediate trial.
It may be noted here that these ladies had.
on the 18th of March, 1895, in n pleading
signed by their own hand and countersigned
by their same nttorneys and counse l , posi
tively nflirmed the genuineness of this same
will and prayed the court to admit it to pro
bate, lly what lapse of memory the informa
tion which they possessed on the 18th of
March, 1880, and which enabled them then to
affirm positively that the pencil will was
genuine and in the most solemn manner to
pray the court to grant it probate, had been
expunged from their minds, so as to make it
possible for them to state 13 the same court,
eighteen months later, that they had no infor
mation nnd did not entertain even' so much as
& belief on the subject, is a problem which the
record contained then no sufficient data sati>
factorily to solve. Neither did it, then, very
clearly appear why they were still urging for
probHte a document about the genuineness ol
which they themselves disclaimed all infor
mation and belief. Xor could it, then, be
readily conceived why they still persisted in
remainirig parties 10 the petition hied b7
them on the 18tn of March, 1895, in which
they positively averred that will to be genuine,
when they had just filed an answer to the
contest of the same will, in which they averred
that they had neither information nor belief
upon the subject.
The contradictorincssâ to use no stronger
termâ of their petition became so manifest
that on the 13th of September, 1890, they
witndrew their petition lor the probate of the
pencil will, leaving on record, however, their
answer to the contest of the testator's grand
son. This new move left tiiem on the record
as ostensible adversaries of the contestants of
the pencil willâ in other words, ranged them
in the contest of the will on the tame side as
myself and opposed 10 their brother, the testa
tor's grundson. In reality, however, it is
manifest that they were acting in conjunction
with their ostensible antagonists and. while
apparently opposed, were, in truth, seeking to
accomplish the same end. if anf doubt could
have beeu entertained upon the subject it
would have been dispelled by the remarks of
one of their attorneys made upon the taking
of their deposition^ and reiterated here in
open court on the Oth of last mouth, that they
were opposed to the probate of that will. At
length, under the pressure of a -.notion to
strike out their pleadiug on the ground that
it was fraudulent and Bled in collusion witn
the other side they, on the 31st of the same ,
month, withdrew their answer.
By tnis withdrawal I am left upon the
record ths sole supporter of the pencil will.
Having now fully stated the circumstances
attending the production of the pencil will,
ita early espousal and ultimato desertion by
the children of the decedent, the question
arises, what is it my duty to do ?
Lest the btep which I am about to take
should bo construed into an approval of the
course pursued by the children, or inu> a re
flection upon the'pencii will, I desire to state
again that I have not now and never have had
any doubt as to the genuineness of that "will.
No reason has been shown why the conclusion
arrived at by me, when 1 filed my petition, on
the 25th 01 March of last yearâ a conclusion
then in accord with the unanimous opinion
ot the threa chiidren and of all their legal ad
visersâshould be cnanged. That, under the
Circumstances, and for the reasons stated,
they nave changed, is surely no reason. I
know of no rule, either in morels or in law,
which requires that I follow them in the
various deviations of the courses they have
pursued. I wns convinced tiie will was genu
ine then, and in that conviction I still abide.
Should 1, however, continue lo urge the
prayer of my petition aud participate in de
fending the contest made against it?
Opposed to this course appear many reasons
of expediency and propriety both.
1 cannot conceive it my duty to thrust upon
the descendants of the deceased a will which
they all unite in opposing, simply because I
caunot agree with them upon tliese grounds of
opposition. Upon tins subject they should be
entitled io exercise their own wishes. As long
as any of them desired the will probated it
was manifestly proper that an executor named
therein should co-operate to accomplish the
desired end. But, for the same reason, it
would seem hardly consistent with propriety
or delicacy for him* to oppose thÂ«nn when they
resolve to abandon their former position. A
will is but an offer of the testator to bestow
his bounty upon those lie has selected
named. He may make the offer â he cannot
compel its acceptance.
If all parties interested under the will
choose to decline it and refuse to present it
there is no power to probate it, for without a
petition there can be 110 probate, and except
by a person interested under the will there
can be no petition. In view of the combined
opposition of all the legatees under it still to
persevere in the attempt to probate this will
would reduce itself 10 an effort to secure
thereby the emoluments which may be inci
dent to its executorship. To make a contest
for that end alone-would place me in a position
both odious and undesirable â one which I do
not think it incumbent upon me to occupy.
There is one further consideration which
should not, in cuiulor, be overlooked. The
cost and expense of lorcing the probate of the
will in the face of the opposition arrayed
against it would necessarily be not incousid
er.ibe. I can see no reason why I should ex
pend any money of mine to probate a will for
others. TheUmdsof the estate are not under
my control, but under tb.it ot the adversaries
of the pencil will. The attorneys of the chil
dren and the administrators have lately
â¢agreed that $10,000 be paid to Jndge Van R.
Paterson lor vie purpose of waging this con
test. I have not the ability to make any sim
ilar disbursement. The fees of witnesses, ex
perts, reporters and juries may be a trifle to
those who have millions at iheir command,
but would operate as a severe tax upon my
slenderer means.
A contest carried on under such disad
vantages might result in undeserved defeat,
and deieat might tend inferential!)* to reflect
upon the validity of certain deeds which Mrs.
Craven, "a lady well, widely and most favor
ably known in thH City" and "a great friend
of Senator Fair,'- holds to valuable property,
and which she asserts were given her by the
Senator at the very time of the execution of
the pencil will. In fairness to the lady, a con
troversy which so Closely affects her rights
should be carried on directly by herself and
not indirectly by me.
Upon a review of all the facts, I am impelled
to the eonc.usion that, as duty required that
I follow the example of the "children when
they petitioned Jor the probate of this will, I
should follow it now when they retire.
Therefore I hereby formally withdraw nnd
dismiss '.he petition filed by mo r>n the 25th of
March, 1895, praying for the probate of the
last will and testament of James G. Fair, dated
September 24. 1894.
