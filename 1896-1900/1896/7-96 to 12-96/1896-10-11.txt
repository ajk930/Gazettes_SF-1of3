CAKTON, Ohio, Oct. 10.â The campaign
here reached its highest pitch of excite
ment to-day. Delegations have been
marching throng b the streets all day and
it was after midnight when the last en
thusiastic political pilgrims left town. The
visitors here to-day numbered more than
22,000 and several thousand persons were
not able to reach Canton for tbe reason
that the railways did not have cars enough
to transport them. Major McKinley made
twenty speeches, a greater number than
he had ever delivered in a single day.
Nine States were represented by delega
tions.
Delegations began to arrive in Canton
as early as half-pas; 4 o'clock this morning.
The echoing tread of the departing Con
federate veterans had hardly died away
before the shouts of fresh arrivals were
heard. The lirst comers before daybreafc
were from Labanon. Pa. They were fol
lowed a few hours later by large delega
tions from other towns in Pennsylvania,
Kentucky, New York and Indiana.
At 9:30 Major McKinley received the
delegations from Lebanon and Reading
and also a large delegation from Lansing,
Mich. On behalf of the Pennsylvania
visitors, Gabriel Moyer of Lebanon made
a stirring speech. D. A. Ainger, Deputy
Auditor-General of Michigan, spoke for
the delegation from that State. Both del
egations were uncommonly enthusiastic
and cheered the candidate with vehemence
when he appeared on the porch. Major
McKinley addressed the three delegations
at once.
Tbe three delegations had scarcely left
the yard before a delegation from Rock
Island, Hi., numbering 200, and the Haid
ware Sftnnd-morrey Club of Reacting?, Pa.,
marched in. Major J. R. Kenney of Read
ing spoke for the hardware men, and bis
address was one of the most polished that
' has been beard from the spokesmen for
visiting delegations.
E. D. Sweeney of Rock Island delivered
a carefully considered speech for his dele
gation and assured Major McKinley that
Illinois would give him more than 60,000
plurality. Major McKinley addressed the
iwo delegations.
It vras a fine delegation from Louisville,
Ky.. that came swinging up the street
behind an excellent hand a* 10:30 o'clock
to call on Major McKinley. Each man
carried a cane, from the end of which de
pended a twist of leaf tobacco and a small
brown ]ug. This was the first delegation
from Kentucky to visit Canton. It num
bered 500, and had to ride all night to get
here. The whoie City Council of Louis-
Tilie and all the municipal officers were
with the delegation. It is the first time in
the nistory of Kentucky that Louisville
has had a Republican Council, and much
was made of that fact in a pleasant way
to-day.
Ma\ or George D. Todd made an eloquent
speech for the Louisville delegation, and
John Barnett spoke lor the Fidelity Re
publican Club, which accompanied it.
To the Louisville delegation Major Mc-
Kinley said:
I appreciate this call from the citizens of a
neighboring State. We are only divided by
the Ohio, but in sentiment, in purpose and in
hope this year nothing can divide us. [Ap
plause.] With the great bridges between Cin
cinnati and Covingtou, instead of two cities
we now have one, and, -while they are under
different management, they are both under
the same flagâ the glorious old stars and
stripes. [Vociferous yelling.] We are the
closest of neighbors and therefore ought to be
the best of friends.
I cannot refrain from congratulating the
men nere assembled, Republicans and Demo
\ crats, on the signal victory they achieved last
L year in the election of Governor Bradley to
ihe chief executive office of the State. [Ap
plause.]
It fu given to your State, and it has been
given to a few commonwealths, to be the first
to lead in the fight for honest money and tbe
gold standard. Your campaign, as I recall it,
was waged to a very great degree upon the
lines of the present National campaign. Great
prominence was given to the question whether
the free and unlimited coinage of silver should
receive the approval of the people of Ken
tucky, or whether the present monetary
standard and financial oystem of the United
Statesshould be continued. Your distinguished
Governor contributed much to illuminate the
subject, and to help to a rightful settlement of
that question. He was aided by leading Dem
ocrats of tbe State, both in direction and in the
final battle of the ballots, which ended so
triumphantly for the cause for which he stood,
and the cause for wnich all of us stand as a
National party thia year. [Cheers.]
To Kentuckians, therefore, the question
would seem to be closed, for it can hardly be
doubted that tbe verdict which she rendered
in that memora-oie campaign will be repeated
this year with even greater and more signal
force. [Loud cries of "You bet it will" and ap
plause.] You are to be congratulated that you
have in the great office of the Secretary of the
Treasury a distinguished citizen of your
State, the Hon. John G. Carlisle, whose devo
tion to sound money has been demonstrated
by high courage and whose stand for the
credit and honor of the country commands al
most universal praise. It is a singular fact,
gentlemen, that the Chicago Democratic Con
vention makes tbe chief assault, not against
the Republican party, but against their own
administration [great laughter and ap
rtlause] and the high public officials who are
â¢fr^cutiug its great offices. They make no as
sp t against the Republican doctrine of pro
tection, which Henry Clay so long and so
ably supported, and in none of- their speeches
do they suggest how they will raise the neces
sary revenue to run the Government.
They assail the administration for issuing
bonds to preserve the country's credit. They
declare unalterably against issuing any more
bonds and give no sign of how, with the defi

cient revenues now existing, they will pro
vide the necessary money to pay the expenses
of the Government. As they will not borrow
any money it will be interesting to the elec
tors of this country to know how they intend
to get it. [Laughter and applause.] Whether
by increasing the subjects of internal taxa
tion, whether by a direct tax upon the people
or by an advance of duties upon foreign goods
into the United States; it would seem that
the oeopie ought to be enlightened upon this
subject. They soy they will not question,
much less discuss it, until what they denomi
nate the supreme issue of the free and inde
pendent coinage of the silver of the world
shah be settled.
They must appreciate, if they have given
the subject any study, that the reduction of
the dollar to 52 cents or less would diminish
the value of the money received from duties
on imports and internal taxes in the same
ratio that they reduce the dollar. In such an
event, more revenue will be required. How
will they raise it? Surely no revenue can
come from the mintsâ no matter how much
silver we might coin, for Its coinage must be
free. [Laughter and applause.] They must
surely know that to coin silver on account of
the Government will require the Government
to buy ailverâ and where will they get the
money to buy it? [Great laughter and ap
plause.] The old-fashioned way taught us by
the fathers was to raise money by taxation,
but they have abandoned that doctrine and
propose to resort to the mints of the United
States, but they can't put gold or silver into
the mints of the United States for coinage for
the Government without buying it, and where
will they get the money to buy it? [Laughter
and cheering.]
After criticizing the Democratic plat
form Mr. McKinley asked: "What will
the verdict of Kentucky be as between
the Chicago Democratic platform and'the
St. Louis Republican platform? [A voice:
'Forty thousand for McKinley,' and loud
applause.l We taKe you at your word,
men of Kentucky. We will be quite sat
isfied here in Ohio with 40.000 in Ken
tucky. [Laughter and a voice: 'You will
get it all right.'] I do not believe, my
fellow-citizens, that you will reverse that
splendid verdict for good money and Na
tional honor that you rendered a year
ago, which embraced every part of our
common country. [Great applause.]
When Major McKinley finished speaking
the Louisville people moved forward to
shake hands with him, and at the same
instant some one with a clear, strong voice
struck up "The Old Kentucky Home."
Immediately the whole delegation joined
in and swelled the volume of sweet sound
and song. There were a score of ladies
present, and their voices mingled with the
deeper ones of the men. It was one of the
prettiest incidents ot the campaign, and it
was entirely spontaneous.
Major McKinley made his fourth speech
to forty bishops of the African M. E.
church of Zion. The bishops selected one
of their Dumber, Bishop C. W- Clinton of
Charlotte, N. C, as spokesman. His aa-
Jress to Major McKinley was listened to
with much interest.
A big delegation of commercial travelers
were the next callers. There were 1500
from Mansfield, Ohio, 250 from Indianapo
lis ana 200 from Rochester, N. Y. Major
McKinley addressed them from the stand
in front of the lawn. With the Mansfield
delegation were Colonel Cappeler and
other well-known politicians. The spokes
man for the Mansfield commercial travel
ers was L- R. Dromberger; for the Roch
ester contingent J. W. Taylor and for the
Indianapolis travelers J. L. Griffiths. In
addressing the traveling men from three
States Major McKinley said :
It gives me vary great pleasure to welcome
the commercial travelers to my city and home.
I don't know where there could be found any
where a more representative body of American
citizens than among the commercial travelers
of the United States. Their business, possibly
better than any other, registers the depression
or prosperity of the country. Nobody knows
sooner than the commercial traveler whether
times are good or bad [applause]; no class of
men so register the waves of buMness as the
men who stand before me here to-day. You
are interested in your occupations and in hav
ing prosperity extend from one end of the
country to the other. You are interested in
having all of our workshops running, all our
mines in operation, all our wheels in motion
and all our workingmen constantly and profit
ably employed. [Cries of "Good, good," and
"That's right."] You are therefore this year,
possibly more than ever before, interested in
the triumph of the political principles which
envelop the weil-beiug and highest pros

perity of the American people. You
want to stop unsold goods and un
paid bills. [Great laughter and ap
plause.] You know better than anybody
else that you cannot sell goods to your custom
ers unless your customers can sell goods to the
people-. [Cries of "That's right" and great
applause.] You know that the- peoDle cannot
buy goods unless they have something to do
with which to earn money that they can buy
them. [Cries of "That's right" and great
cheering.] That's what is the matter with the
country. That is the diagnosis of our condi
tion at this hour â business has been stopped,
the wheels of industry are not running, idle
men are on the streets. [A voice 'Thousands
of them."] Many of the manufacturing estab
lishments are closed^tnd you are not doing as
well as you were in 1892. [Cries of "No, sir;
we are uot."] And the best thing I can wish
for each and every one of you is a return to
the splendid prosperity of four years ago. The
money of the country happily is all right.
The Republican party made it all right, and
Grover Cleveland's administration has kept it
good. [Cries of "That's right"]
We propose, my fellow-citizens, to continue
that good, sound, unquestioned, undepreci
ated money with which to do the business of
this great country. [Continuous cheering.]
What a nation we are. Why, in 1860, when
Abraham Lincoln, of blessed memory â the im
mortal hero of emancipation and of the war
when he took control of this Government, the
entire wealth was sixteen billions of dollars.
When Benjamin Harrison went out of office
it was sixty-three billions of dollars, and more
than ',wo-thirds of the great war debt had been
wiped out. Since that time we have been do
ing little but making debts for the Govern
ment and debts for the people. [Laughter.] I
know the value of the commercial traveler.

laughter,] There is no such recruiting-officer

The old pavilion in what waa once
Woodward's Gardens last night resumed
the festal gayety of bygone times, Ben
jamin Butterworth and Francis X. Schoon
maker beine the magnets which attracted
to the historic edifice a cultured and en
thusiastic audience, numbering at the
lowest estimate 3000.
Both speakers are statesmen of well
earned renown, each having a Brilliant
record in Congress, where Mr. Butter
worth represented Ohio and Mr. Schoon
maker New Jersey.
Portraits of McKinley and Hobart,
framed in garlands of fragrant bloom,
graced the walls. The cornice was out
lined with row upon row of fairy globes
iv red, white and bine, while pillars and
gallery railings were festooned with hang
ings of bunting caught up by golden stars
and eagles.
The combined voices of the Knicker
bocker and California male quartets
blended most harmoniously in the
patriotic four-part song, "Freedom, Home
and Native Land," with which the meet
ing opened. As an encore, in response to
a prolonged and enthusiastic recall, the
singers gave "The Fellow I'd Like to
Meet," a campaign song abounding in
home thrusts at the "other fellows" which
called forth much applause.
Charles L. Felton, the chairman, was
received with a round of cheers and spoke
as follows:
Fellow-citizenn: The time draws near when
we as a people are uot only to select the chief
magistrate oi the Nation, but what is quite of
more importunce to decide upon the principles
by which we shnll be governed for the next
four years. We have met to-night to discuss
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the political issues of the day and decide in
our own minds upon the policy which we
shall pursue. In my opinion, fellow-citizens,
never but on two great historic occasions, so
memorable as not to need naming, has this
country ever been confronted by more serious
or alarming conditions.
Not only the peace and urosperity of tha
Nation, but the stability of this great Govern
ment is lit stake. Never before in the history
of this great country have we ever witnessed
such an intense rteuression of our mercantile
interests: never before in the history of this
country have we been in that peculiar finan
cial condition which is creating uurest
throughout the length and breadth of the land
as at thU time.
Tbe result is that some milliousâapproach
ing 2,000,000â 0f citizens are thrown iuto en
forced Idleness. They neither create wealth
nor b&a they consume it, the result being a,
loss to the Nation ; and never can we look for
ward to win that degree of prosperity which
we once enjoyed until something' is done to
set at rest this fear which disturbs the entire
community and put the idle laborers at work.
Fellow-cltiaens, th<? times are serious, in
deed; so serious as to require the calm and set
tled thought of the best and the honest minds;
too serious to indulge iv prejudice or passion;
too serious to inscribe upon the banner of any
party dishonesty and repudiation, because no
political authority can exempt us from follow
ing the old motto which we learned at the fire
side â that honesty is the best. policy.
It now becomes my pleasing duty to intro
duce to you the Hon. Benjamin Butterworth
of Ohio. As his lame has preceded him, it is
sufficient oniy to mention his name in order to
introduce him.
The Hon. Benjamin Bntterworth, on
being introduce!, was greeted with a suc
cession of cheers and bursts of applause.
In the course of his brilliant address he
said:
"Like your chairman I have lost a part
of my voice. I have been traversing thia
glorious State from north to south and
the changes of climate have treated roe
without mercy. No Californian can be
made to confess that there are any draw
backs to California's general delightful
ness. I suppose that's so; bnt I wish this
Californian frog could be got out of my
throat.

fornian journeyings: The people of Cali- j
fornia have been wonderfully and incalcu
labv benefited by the policy to which the
Republican party is committed. Cali
fornians, of all Americans, ought to vote
solid for McKinley.
"It is true that I have met almost a
dozen people here who said they were
going to vote for Bryan. Perhaps they
will, but 1 trust they will experience a
changa of heart before the 3d of November.
The American sometimes goes wrong
politically, but when he has a chance to
think he generally gets back into tne right
track.
"Now I don't intend to go into statistics
In order to prove the principles in wnose
reference Isi eak. We hear it said figures
don't lie; but it doesn't follow that liars
don't sometimes hgure. So I will leisures
alone and try to confine myself to facts.
"The Republican party stands com
mitted to the position that the National
honor must be maintained. The issues of
this year of 1896 can only be compared to j
those which confronted the Nation in j
1860. Now, as then, the integrity of the
Republic is threatened. When the fate of
the Union was imperiled and division
seemed almost inevitable true patriots
rallied from all parts of the country.
Gray-haired men.jong retired from pub
lic life, rushed again into the arena, join
ing hands with half-srown youths in a
grand endeavor to save the Nation.
"Something of the same sort is hap
pening to-day. The men who under
stand and appreciate the terrible signifi
cance of the dangers hanging over U3
have sunk their party differences in a
concerted effort to stay the progress of the
plague? What is the plaeue? tisks some
hapless being, ignorant and indifferent re
garding his country's welfare. I will an
twer you. The plague which threatens to
prove our National death and is sure if
unchecked to bring about our National
dishonor is universal industrial paraly
sis â an evil so creat and so menacing that
it cannot be exaggerated. This is the
plague which must be met and counter
acted unless we are willing to let it
ruin us.
"It was said by a great writer in this
country, 'America is another name for op
portunity,' but I never realized unqual
ifiedly and absolutely the force ot that ex
pression until I visited California. When
I heard pioneers grumbling â men who had
been here for five or six years and called
themselves pioneers â when I heard tiiera
complaining, and when I see here the
crops you are getting, when I see that you
only tickle the soil with a hoe* to make it
laugh with the harvest, I wonder how
they ran find words to complain.
"We recognize the hard conditions; set
yourselves about repairing and correcting
them. There are men within the sound of
my voice who remember what the pioneers
had to encounter in Ohio, Wisconsin,
Michigan and Illinois. There there were
great forests to be removed, and there was
aconstant warfare against all ttieelenients
and against the stubborness of the soil.
It had to be prepared before we could
Elant anything in it. But here you are |
lessed exceedingly. In some things you j
get four or rive cr six crops a year.
"We all recognize tbat the condition is
a hanl one, even in California. If you ]
feei that the lines are bard in California,
(to beyond the Rocky Mountains â go to I
the furnaces, to the mills, the factories,
the forests, the streams and the fisheries
of the East, where you will find hundreds
of thousands of men standing kite, beg- i
ging for an opportunity to work in order |
that they might be enabled to buy some
of the products of California. We realize
that there, as here, the lines are hard, but
much harder there than here.
"Now, the first thing we want to ask is, I
how it occurred that we have stumbled j
upon those hard lines. There is always a ]
reason for everything, and we can always |
battle with a disease better when we know j
the cause of it. I think that California
knows the nature of the disease, whether !
my Populistic friends will admit it or not.
'â¢This i> a nation of parties. Wherever !
there is an issue upon any given subject j
we cannot be on both sides, although
there are some persons possibly who can.
We can take one side or the other. We
either approve or disapprove, or wo dis
sent of approve, one or the other. Ido
not refer to the Indianapolis branch of the
Democratic party. They are with us, ex
cept upon the tariff plank in their plat
form, but they are not worrying much
-bout that when thtey stand in the pres
ence of the fact that in the adoption of
that plan four years ago they didn't act
wisely.
"The Democrats left nobody in doubt.
They said to the world, "If we are en
trusted \\ ith power in the legislative
branch of the Government and in the I
executive branch of the Government we j
will first destroy the protective system in i
which California, more than Connecticut, j
is interested.' And they told you why.
They said, "It will bring to our country a
grander and wider prosperity than we I
know now; your business will be in- |
creased: your fleece, your products will
bring better prices.'
"Our people believed them; they were
so seductive in their argument that it
prospered beyond compare. Everybody
admitted it, and they wanted a greater
prosperity if it were possible. Henry j
Watterson wrote the tariff plank in the I
Democratic platform, and he knows bow j
to say a thine. Mr. Bryan said that the
protective tariff was a system of robbery
which permits one neighbor to insert his
naud into nis neighbor's pocket and take
money therefrom without consideration.
Bryan said that the system was a robbery,
and he helped to do that for California
which has injuriously affected every fire
side within your State. There are not
twenty-five men within the sound of my
voice tbat don't know that that is unquali
fiedly true.
"To-day there are sheep going un
sheared in California, simply because
their owners do not know whether the !
"woel will be worth shearing. Uncer- !
tainty, distrust, lack of business cond- i
dence and general shakiness pervade our j
country in view of the mere possibility of
a new and luinous financial policy. What
would be the result were the reality to
come to pas)-?
"California's business men are shaking
in their boots at the mere notion of a
reign_of Bryanism. The men of this
S^ate are no fools. The evils that they |
fear are grave evils, and I for one am sure j
they will down their formidable enemy I
on election day.
"We hear that the protective tariff will
keep up our prices and make things
harder for the poor. The thing is to keep
up a fair schedule of American wages and
give every honest ma:i ia the country a
chance to eara a decent living. If wages
are kept up who cares whether prices
teep up or not? Was there any complaint
regarding high pfiC3s during the flush
times, when everybody had plenty of
money ? Such a regime is what the Re
publican party desires to see inaugurated.
"The gentleman who runs with Mr. I
Watson [great laughter] is opposed to the
protective policy on the ground that it
favors monopoly. This remains to be
proved, for it has never yet been proved.
The policy of protection will favor the
American who is willing to work, and the
harder he works the better chance he will
have. The monopoly will have to bow be
fore the majesty of American labor, which
the Republican policy will elevate and
keep sacred."
At this juncture the Phoenix Republi
can Club, which was drilling near by,
marched through tne hall. The audience
cheered lustily as the fine-looking column
of young men, four abreast, filed by, its
band playing a brilliant march, while the
handsome uniforms and flashing swords
added a finishing touch to the general ef
fect.
"I like to see those boys," commented
Mr. Butterworth. "They wear the Federai
blue. Your National Guard wears the
Federal blue as well. Perhaps later on I
may pay my respects to one of Califor
nia's candidates for Congress, who re
ferred to the National Guardsmen as 'as
sassins of plutocrats.' "
The Phoenix boys having departed, Mr.
Butterworth said:
"I want to show in a few words that
National honesty is the best policy for our
country. In order to pay our just debts
we must have money. They tell us we
have money enough. I deny it â that is to
gay, we have not money enough in circu
lation. The volume of money is greater
in this country than over before in its his
tory; but this is not enough. In addition
to money we require public confidence in
business ventures. Moneyed men who
fear a reign of National insolvency are
loth to let their dollars slip between tbeir
lingers.
"Still, money must circulate. The
nimble sixpence is better than the slow
shilling. The question is, then, how shall
we set the money a-going? How can we
make the holders of money set their funds
rolling in the marts of commerce? We
can only do it by making business safe.
Let moneyed men see that in investing
their money they will not throw it away,
and cash will circulate freely enough.
"What caused this lack of confidence?
Well, it was the dollar." [Laughter.]
Then Air. Butterwortn went on to say
that his Democratic friends found some
consolation in a letter which he once
wrote. But he proposed to repeat what he
said then and he would maintain it, and
he would say that the man who said that
the Republican party was a gold mono
metallic party was not just to himself nor
to the Republican party nor quite truth
ful.
Â» "If there ever was a party in favor of
bimetallism, a party that has never uttered
a prayer except for bimetallism, that party
is the Republican party. My brother of
the Examiner has a plan not to bring us
to bimetallism, but to silver monometal
lism. Our plan has been not to drive a
tandem team with silver ahead and gold
out of sight, but to drive the twin coursers
abreast, the goid and the silver.
"I say now that it was against the best
interests of civilization and of humanity
to demonetize silver. I think so now, but
it has been done. It is not a theory; it is
a condition. We must study how to undo
it. If somebody needs kicking let him be
kicked, but don't let us kick: ourselves.
The Populist thinks he will die next
March and he wants to commit suicide in
November. [Laughter.]
"The demonetization of silver has re
duced the value of silver throughout the
world, but it is done. It has enhanced
the value of gold, but it has not author
ized us to swindle our neighbor, if it did.
I say that your plan is not a good one. It
will ruin and wreck and dishonor us from
first to last. England will never agree to
bimetallism unless she is forced, but Ger
many and France nave extended the hand
to us, and we can soon have an interna
tional agreement, and we can agree
whether it shall be 16, 17 or 20 to 1, so that
our dollar will be as good then as it is
r.ow from pole to pole, and all around the
world we will still have maintained our
honor and our credit.
"But you say to me, 'the law fixes the
value of money ; doesn't the constitution
provide that Congress shall regulate the
value of and snail coin money?' No;
neither Congress nor the Reichstag nor
the Chamber of Deputies in France can
fix the purchasing power of money. It is
fixed by a law which we can neither
amend nor repeal ; by a law that fixes the
commercial value of everything in the
world. Silver is property and Congress
can neither increase nor decrease its pur
chasing power.
"But there is a wide difference between
the debt-paying power and the purchas
ing power. Congress can enable me to
swindle you out of jour boots by fixing
thedebi-paying power of the greenback at
a certain rigute. That piece of paper, the
solemn promise of my Government, might
not be worth more than 10 cents on the
dollar, when it was at 35 cents at the time
this young republic was staggering under
the blows oi a gigantic revolution."
The speaker went on to relate an anec
dote illustrating the difference between
the debt-paying power and purchasing
power of the dollar. A man pays his debt
in a cheap money the debt-paying power
of which has been doubled by Congress
since the debt was contracted. The credi
tor was obliged to take it, but that was
the business of yesterday or of last week.
The same man goes to the ex-creditor to
day ancfoffers to buy from him $1000 worth
of lemons.
"Very well," says the owner of the
lemons, "but in what money do you pro
pose to pay me? "
' 'The same money I paid you last week,"
replies the ex-debtor.
".Not if I know it." says the creditor.
Congress cannot compel a man to sell
his cow or his horse rr his wneat or bis
bread or meat. The seller settles the
purchasing vaiue of the money in which
he is to be paid ; it is fixed by the com
mercial world. The world's experience
says that the Government stamp does not
fix the value of money.
The speaker told how. in a season of
great distress, a law was made in France,
backed by the guillotine and the military
power of the nation, to compel the farmer
and the tradesman to accept, assignats for
their goods and their labor, but it was
found impossible to enforce the law. It
might as well nave been written on water.
"You and Iseil what we take out of the
ground, what we raise and produce, our
cattle, potatoes, oranges, fruit, lead, cop
per and iron at the market rate fixed by
the commercial world, and you and I are
mad because the fellow who has dug his
silver out of another place in the ground
over there doesn't get for his silver a
hundred per cent more than it is worth,
j and we would have to pay it if he did."
This apt way of illustrating the subject
| brought lorth a continued round of ap
plause.
"How does that strike you as a sensible
proposition? Suppose 1 was working a
silver mine and I cirue to buy your pota
toes-.
" -What is It worth? 1 you ask.
" 'Ob, 50 cents an ounce in the market;
but I want you to take it at $1 an
ounce.'
"What would you say to that?" con
tinued General Butterworth. "You would
invite him to go somewhere, wouldn't
you? "
The sneaker went on with the declara
[ tion, the truth of which he said had been
affirmed by experience, that the cheaper
money always drove out tne better money.
After the battle of Bull Run, when green
backs fell below par, gold and silver fled
as from a plague-smitten city. He added:
"You are selling, under the Wiison act,
your product at less than what it is
worth."
He did not see a piece of gold coin once
a month in the East, while in California
he saw nothing but gold and silver, and lie
added: "And yet you fellows are worry
ing because you have no cheaper moaey."
At no time in the history of tha Anglo-
Saxon race have its members raised their
hands to be shackled. We love liberty;
but the liberty which we love goes hand
in hand with law. The revolutionists oi
France gave to their country not liberty,
but anarchy. This is not the sort of
liberty we want. The ideal American
liberty is guaranteed by the upholdiug of
a fearless and incorruptible judiciary. We
have in our Supreme 1 Court a body of jur-^
i-ts which has never yet been branded'
with the infamous seal of corruption. To
be sure, a short time ago a body of men
attacked it; but this attack, unwarranted
as it was ill-timed and unconsidered,
called forth a burst of indignation which
may properly be called National.
"Mr. Loud, that splendid Congressman

these deluded ones are few. The mass of
American voters will undoubtedly rise in
their might and with the power of the bal
lot guide our country's destinies into the
paih of general prosperity and National
honor."
Mr. Butterworth's masterly address was
rewarded by a loud and sustained burst of
cheering.
The chairman announced that ex-Con
gressnian Frank X. Schoonmaker of New
Jersey was to have spoken, but owing to
the lateness of the hourâ it being after 10
â his address would be postponed.
Cries of "No, no," "Go ahead," and
"Schoonmaker," with much cheering,
greeted this announcement, until Mr.
Feiton was constrained to say:
il All right; I take it all back. Mr.
Scboonmaker will speak."
The ex-Congressman was very brief. In
opening his remarks :.e said:
I am reminded by this evening's meeting of
the old story of two oysters. It is said tnat
once upon a time an oyster, dressed in his
Sunday best, sallied forth ea route to a church
fair. As he turned a corner he ran against an
oyster friend, who he discovered was bound
for the same place.
"Well," he exclaimed, "if you're going to
the social I may as well go home again. What
business have two oysters in the stew served
at a church lair?"
I feel pretty much as that oyster did. Mr.
Butterworth nas stated my dearest principles
so clearly and so well that I have nothing to
add, except my hearty indorsement of every
word he said. A time in American history has
now come when a new alignment of parties is
imperatively demanded â a time when all
decent, respectable and honorable voters of
this country should go upon one side and leave
the dishonest and improvident and those who
would attempt to get somethiug for nothing,
upon the other. If such an alignment
be made, an 4it seems to be the duty
of every person to bring it about, then
when the elections of next fall take place, the
American people will give to the world the
greatest demonstration of political morality
whichever has been witnessed by mankind.
Such an alignment, if made, ought to array in
tms country at least 70,000,000 of people out
of the whole 72,000,000 upou .the side of the
Nation's honor and against the side of the Na
tion's dishonor.
If such am alignment takes place these 70,
--000,000 people would practically say to the
world this thine: "We are poor; we have had
three years of hard times, largely becairee we
have been either betrayed by our Government
or because through our Government's incom
petency our business has been taken away
from us and been given to the Old World. We
are poor as a consequence of this. None
of us is earning a living and none of us
is making a living, and we are a people who
live generously, and we all need more than we
ever needed before. Now, we have the power
by suffrage to scale down our debts; we have
ihe power by suffrage to thoroughly repudiate
them if we choose; and not only have we the
power to repudiate or scale them do>vn, but we
have the temptation to do this thing because
of ihe unnatural distress which we are to-day
suffering and have suffered for three years.
Still, we are Americans, and we utterly refuse
to repudiate one farthing or to scale down our
debts one cent."
If 70,000,000 people oi this country out of
the 72,000,000 represented by the votes cast
at next November's election should make this
declaration, it would be such an exhibition of
morality as would astound even the Christian
nations of the Old World and make pagan na
tions wonder what it is that makes^Christians
good. After such an exhibition of mo
rality as that can anyone doubt that any
person in the Old World who has a pound or
shilling to invest would rather Invest it
among us Americans than anywhere else in
this whole world? So that, if the question
were not one of integrity and of honor and of
patriotism, it would still be one of profit, for
such an exhibition of political morality would
pay better than any single action which the
Americans, as a nation, have ever performed
in the face of mankind.
Amid the plaudits of the vast audience,
Mr. Shoonmaker resumed his seat, and,
after a kind word of parting from Mr. Fel
ton, the vast assemblage broke up with
three cheers for McKinley and Hobart and
for the speakers of the evening.
A POPULIST GONE.
He Could Not Endure Being: Sold
Like Merchandise.
Among the Populists who have been
disgusted with the sale of their rartv to
the Democracy is G. R. Mi-Math, People's
party nominee for the Assembly from
Menciocino County. He said to a Call re
porter yesterday: "I have withdrawn my
name as a candidate for the Assembly. I
could not do otherwise after we had been
so completely sold out by Cator, Wardall
and others. I am not a Democrat and
never will be swallowed up by the Demo
cratic tiger if I can get out of the way.
The Democrats are trying to kill our party,
and the only thing to do now is to reor
ganize and get rid of the traitors and let
them go back to the old . parties, we don't
care to which.
"It looks as though the Republicaus
would carry Mendocino County, although
we could hays carried it on a straight
Populist issue. I don't want auy fusion
in mine."
Retail Liquor Dealers.
The regular meeting of the Pacific
Coasc Retail Liquor Dealers and
Barkeepers Protective Association, was

James Kidney. The speakers confined
themselves to the nominees on the local
ticket, and when the names of George W.
Elder, candidate for Superintendent of
Streets; Cord H. Wetjen, nominee for Tax
Collector, and William A. Deane for Audi
tor were mentioned, each name was greeted
with enthusiastic clieers. The league, by
unanimous vote, indorsed the candidacy

SINGS THE SONG
FOR FREE SILVER
Byran Makes Four Fairly
Long Speeches at St.
Paul.
Asked an Unpleasant Question
Which He Positively De
clines to Answer.
CHEAP MONEY THE ONLY TOPIC
For Reasons Best Kacwn to Himself
the Nebraskan Can See No Other
Issu? in the Campaign.
ST. PAUL, Mixx., Oct. 10.â Four fairly
lone speeches constituted William J.
Bryan's tribute to-night to the fight for
free silver that is being waped in Minne
sota. After a number of brief talks to
people at many stations along the line of
the Great Northern Railroad between
Fargo and St. Paul, he reached here this
evening at 6:30 o'clock, accompanied by
members of the State and local escort com;
mittees and was taken to the Hotel Ryan.
A delegation of old soldiers from Minne
apolis and this city met and cheered him
there.
At 8 o'clock Mr. Bryan, Ignatius Don
nelly and other speakers, Democratic and
Populistic, were escorted to the Audito
rium, a large structure capable of holding
about 7000 people, seated and standing.
It was crowded to the doors, and the
candidate received a flattering reception,
cheer after cheer being given on his ap
pearance. Mr. Bryan made his most im
portant speech of the evening there. His
audience did not warm up to his remarks
at first, despite the greeting it had given
him, but toward the conclusion of his ad
dress, the enthusiasm became rampant.
His next speech was at the West Side
Opera-house, where another congregation
equally enthusiastic and quite as uncom
fortably packed as that at the Auditorium,
had been waiting some time for his ap
pearance. Then he went to Market Hall
and spoke briefly. It began to rain hard
while Mr. Bryan was addressing the en
thusiastic crowd in Market Hall, and the
open air meeting at Rice's Park, the last
on the programme, was abandoned. Mr.
Bryan returned to the Hotel Ryan at 11
o'clock, and went to bed.
During his speech at the Auditorium
Mr. Bryan was interrupted several times
by question s. One man wanted to know
what was the cause of the Homestead
strike, and auother asked how it would be
easier to get silver from the silver kings
than it was to get gold from the gold
kings.
S. L. Pierce, the chairman of the meet
ing, introduced Mr. Bryan after Louis
Nash had presented him witn a silver pen
in behalf of Organized Labor Bryan- Lynn
Club of St. Paul. Mr. Bryan said:
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: It j
gives mo a great pleasure to be permitted to
defend our cause in the presence of an audi
euce in this great city, and before addressing
myself to the subject in hand I desire to ex
press to the organized labor of this city my
grateful appreciation of the gift which they
have presented. It is a gold pen with a silver
holder, and if! shall be elected by my country
men to the chief executive of the Nation ihat
pen and holder shall be used to sign a free
coinage bill at the. earliest possible moment
[applause]; and I am glad ihat the pen with
which my signature shall be affixed is the gift
of the laboring men, because, my friends, I be
lieve that the laboring men of this eouutry â
nay, more than that, the laboring men of all
this world are interested in the restoration of
silver to its ancient place by tne side of gold.
[Applause.]
1 would not favor the free coinage oi silver
did I not believe that it would be beneficial
to those who toil, because, my friends, my
political philosophy teaches me that there can
be no prosperity in this Nation unless that
prosperity begins first among those who create
wealth and finds its way upward to the other
classes of society. [Applause.] More than
that,*civilization itsen rests upon the great
mass of the people and it is only by carrying
the mass of ihe people upward and onward
tnat you can expect any advance in civiliza
tion. There can be no civilization where a few
in a land have more thau"hey can use and the
many have an insufficient amount to give the
comiorts of life. [Applause.] Nor do I believe
that these great inequalities can exist in a na
tion where the Government observes the old
maxim of equal rights to all and special priv
ileges to none. [Applause.]
When government is properly administered
there will be no representative of a coal trust
sitting by every fireside to exact tribute from
those who desire to be protected from the cold
of winter. [Applause.] When government is
properly administered there will be no syndi
catea fattening out of the Government's ad
versities after they have brought those adver
sities on the Government for tiieirown benefit.
[Applause.] When government is properly ad
ministered there will be no corporations
which assume greater authority than the
power which created them. [Applause.]
vVhen government is properly administered
it will recognize those fundamental principles
set forth in the Declaration of Independence
that all are created equalâ that governments
are instituted to preserve the rights and that
governments derive tneir just powers from the
consent ot tin* governed. [Applause.]
When these four principles are applied, then
goverumeut will be what it ought to be. Jack
son nas well said that theje are no necessary
evils in government, that evils exist only iv
its abuse; and, my mends, it is not govern
ment that we raise our hands against. No
man who understands society or the necessity
for government will raise his hand against
government. It is against the abuse of gov
ernment that we rebel. [Great cheering.] It
is against the abuse of governments and we
shall not be driven from our purpose to eradi
cate these abuses.
We have made the money question a para
mount issue of the campaign; and yet our op
ponents are not satisfied to meet this question
openly. -They have never been satisfied to
meet the money question. The advocates of
the gold standard never lought an open tight
and never will. [Applause.]
You ask me why they do not. I will tell you.
Shakespeare explained it when he says that it
is conscieuce that makes cowards of men, and
the conscience of the advocate of the gold
standard tells him that his policy enriches
some, but is a cursu to the great mass of the
people. [Applause.]
A voiceâ "Wil lyou answer a question?"
"Yes, sir, "said Mr. Bryan. [Cries of "No.no,
sit down."]
Mr. Bryanâ Wait a motaenl, my friends. I
am willing to answer any question pertinent
to this discussion, because when a man be
lieves he is right, no man confuses him, my
friends. [Applause.]
The manâ Under the advocacy of the Repub
lican party, what, in your opinion, was the
cailse of the Homestead and PUUburg strikes?
[Criesof "Sit down."]
Mr. Bryanâ My friends, when I submit to an
inquiry, 1 have a right to suppose that it will
be directeu toward the subject which lam
discussing and not a subject which I am not
discussing. [Applause.] If anybody desires
to ask any question connected with the money
question wmle I am discussing that question
he is perfectly at liberty to do so and 1 shall
not embarrass you by my reply. I will try to
give you light, if you are wrong ana if 1 am
wrong I shall be as glad to be put right as I
am to put you right. [Applause.] Before the
Republican Convention did you Lot hear a
great many people tuls about the impossi
bility of having two-yard sticks â did you not
hear them talk, about gold being the only
money fit for civilized nations; did
you not hear them talk about our
having outgrown silver; did you not
hear them talk about the. mine-owners profit
ing from free coinage and the demagogue who
tried to curry favor with the people by advo
cating free coinage and the dishonest debtor
who wanted to pay his debts in cheap dollars?
You heard all this, but when the Republican
Convention met and they had a number
there sufficient to write a platform did they
put in there anything about two-yard sticks?
Did they pnt in there anything about the
demagogue who was advocating bimetallism?
Not at all. That Republican platiorm ex
pressly declared that the gold standard was
not a desirable thing. That platform ex
pressly pledges the Republican party to get
rid 01 a gold standard and substitute the
double standardâ wheD? When leading com
mercial nations are not opposed to it.
Mr. Bryan then referred to the failure
of the Republican platform to declare that
the gold standard was desirable, and said
that no party in the history of the Nation
had ever declared that the gold standard
was a good thing. A man in the audience
inquired how it would be any easier under
free coinage to get silver from the silver
kings than it is to get gold from the gold
kings. Mr. Bryan replied: "Is that all
the difficulty that my friend has, or has
he some other I can explain at the same
time?" [Applause.] Continuing, Mr.
Brvan said:
My friends, the gentleman has asked a very
simple question, and I am glad that it is
asked, because it will show you whax tiny
th ngs can be stumbling-blocks for those who
do not want to step over them. [Applause.]
The gentleman wants to know how we are
going to get money from the silver kings. I
want him to remember this: That he has two
arguments (if he represents the gold-standard
idea), which I would like to have him recon
cile when he has time. They tell us ttiat the
silver king will convert what is now worth 50
cents into 100 cents and make the difference.
That is one of the troubles, is it not?
The man â Yes.
JSlr. Bryanâ And then when he has done that
it will be a 50-cent dollar. That is another
difficulty, is it not? [Great cheering.]
Now, when you have time to think about it
I want you to try to figure out how that can
be a 100-cent dollar long enough for the miner
to miike 50 cents on it and then become a
50-cent dollar lor all the rest of the people.
[Applnuse.] The only way in which the miner
cun make that profit is by converting a piece
of silver now worth 50 cents into a dollar
which will be worth 100 cents. If, when he
gets through, he has only converted a 50-cent
piece ot silver into a 50-cent dollar he has not
made aoything by the operation. [Applause.]
Mr. Bryan then spoke along familiar
lines on the money question, and referred
to McKinley 's speech in 1890 in support of
the Sherman law. In closing, Mr. Bryan
said : â¢
I am willing to trust the justice of our cause
to the sense of justice that exists in every in
divideal, and, my friends, if we cannot win
this contest by the voluntary wish and votejof
the American peopie I would prefer to wait
four years more before we win it. â¢ [Cheers.] I
say, my friends, I would prefer to wait than to
feel that having won the contest I was not
supported by a majority of the American peo
ple. I realize the fight that we have on hand.
1 realize the work that lies before a President
who meets these combinations. 1 realize the
responsibility of the office and I want to feel,
if I am elected, that I have behind me the
hearts of a majority of these peop'.e, and if I
have, bo help me God, I will carry out that
platform. [Applause. ]
THOUSANDS CHEER
MAJOR McKINLEY
f Continued from First Pagt.\
in the United States for a political party as one
of these commercial travelers. [Applause.]
They go everywhere and they are good talkers,
as you have demonstrated by the choice of
your spokesman hereto-day. [Laughter and
great eneerinje.] I thank you and bid you all
good day.
Three hundred Pennsylvanians of the
anthracite regions of the Lackawanna and
Wyoming valleys marched up and failed
the space before the stand, while the trav
eling men were departing.
Just behind them marched the Grand
Army Club from Baltimore. General T.
F. Long introduced the Maryland visitors
to Major McKinley in a pleasant speech.
The latter responded in a patriotic ad
dress.
The seventh speech was made to the
delegation from the Lackawanna and Le
high valleys. The spokesman fordelegation
was Professor W. P. Gray. The Scranton
members of the delegation were particu
larly enthusiastic. They led the cheering
when Major McKinley rose to speak.
The next delegations were industrial
ones of Cleveland. The employes of the
Otis Steel Company were represented by
Otto Grabien, who introduced them to
Major McKinley. The candidate spoke
briefly and the delegation made room for
the workingmeu employed by the city of
Cleveland. Tneir spokesman was J. A.
Leighton. Tlie delegation was an en
thusiastic one and Major McKinley
thanked them for their call and told them
he was glad to see by their inscriptions on
the banners they bore that they were for
protection.
Major McKinley made his tenth ad
dress to a delegation composed of the
mission board, the editors, the members
of the publication company and ministers
of the Evangelical church. Bishop Bow
man was spokesman, and Bishops Esper
and Horn were witn the party.
By this time the street as far as the eye
could reach was filled with waiting dele
gations. One could count ninety flags
borne by color-sergeants, while campaign
banners were too numerous to count. The
Cleveland, Akron and Columbus Railroad
Sound-money Club marched in before the
stand at 2 o'clock. There were 300 work
ingmen in ihe body. Tney cheered Major
McKinley lustily. Many of them were
Democrats, who were at>out to cast their
first Republican vote. Jonn H. Sample
made a very happy speech on behalf of
the Cleveland, Akron and Columbus em
ployes, to, wnich Major McKinley re
sponded.
A splendid delegation from Wheeling,
W. Va., containing 2500 voters, marched
up the street, with bands playing and
banners waving. Half of them filled the
v yard and the other half stood in the street.
There were a number of handsomely uni
formed clubs. H. C. Richards was spokes
man for the H. C. Richards Club of "six
footers," Edgar Boyd for the Riverside
Iron and Steel Workers and Thomas
Davidson for the Potterymen.
A delegation of 250 enthusiastic com
mercial travelers from Terre Haute, Sul
livan, Vincennes and Evansville, Ind.,
were the next callers. The spokesman
was a "boy orator," E. Clyde Wilvert of
Terre Haute aged 10. He was introduced
by J. J. Sbuttleworth, who, with the aid of
a big policeman, swung him on to a high
chair from which elevated perch he deliv
ered an excellently well t constructed polit
ical oration.
Big delegations were marching up the
street and a score of bands werÂ» playing.
Major McKinley had to make his remarks
very brief. The next delegation was a big
brigade of workingmen 2500 strong from
the Cleveland rolling-mills. They made
the ground shake with their tread and the
windows rattled with their cheers. T. it.
Hopkins spoke for the wire department
and James Bampton for the ironworkers.
One of the most inspiring delegations
which has visited Canton this week was
that composed of the Commercial Travel
ers' McKinley Club and the Commercial
Travelers' Sound Money Club of St. Louis,
which arrived at the house at 4:SO o'clock
this afternoon. There were about 800 in
the party. Congressmen Richard Bar
tholdt and A. N. Mosely of Missouri were
with the party. L. A. Phiilips was spokes
man for the Commercial Travelers' Mc-
Kinley Club and Edgar Skinner for the
Commercial Travelers' Sound Money Club
of St. Louis. Archie G. Pftilhps, # a small
boy, presented Major McKinley with a
silk flag, saying, "Tne loyal hearts of the
loyal boys of St. Louis beat for you."
FAST WHEELING
AT MILWAUKEE
Four Thousand Spectators
at the National Park
Meet.
Bald Defeats Sanger in a Match
Face, Mile Heats, for a
Big Purse.
BREAKS THE TKACK RECORD.
Other Events, However, in Which
the Local Champion Makes
Very Swift Time.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Oct. 10.â Four
thousand people attended the bicycle meet
held at National Park this afternoon. The
feature of the day was a match race, mile
heats, for a purse of $1000, between E. C.
Bald and W T . C. Sanger. Bald won the
race in straight heats. The track was in
fine condition, but a stiff wind up the
stretch bothered the riders considerably.
In the last heat Bald had the position
behind the tandem, trailed closely by
Sanger. As they swung into the stretch
Bald jumped the tandem and Sanger fol
lowing attempted to pass Bald, but was
unable to do so, Bald winning by a wheel's
length. Time, 2:10.
In the second heat the order behind the

LEXINviTONJ Ky., Oct. 10.â There was
another large attendance at the trotting
races here to-day. The weather was clear
and warm and the track fast. The event
of the day was the pacing division of the
great Kentucky futurity, but only four
three-year-old side-wheelers started. The
favorite, Sulphide, owned by Dubois Bros,
of Denver, took sick just before the race
was called and the driver, being unable
to find a veterinary in tirae to make a
certificate to the fact, had to start him.
While he made a fairly cood showing, he
was no match for Dan Q, the Michigan
colt, which won tne stake in three straight
heats with practically no effort. The 2:20
pace, continued from yesterday, was easily
won in the first heat to-day by the favor

PROTECTION OF ROYAL GUESTS.
In Reviewing Events of the O.d World
Frederic Also Scores Lord Rose
bery's Course.
[Copyright, 1896, 6y the New York Times. J
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 10.â It is hard to
say whether what was seen in Paris tbis
week or what was heard on all sides there
was the most remarkable. Certainly the
spectacle wiiich Paris provided for its im
perial guests stands quite without par
allel. There were millions of strangers in
the city, mostly provincial French. There
were miles of densely packed crowds
w nerever one wanted to go, and leagues of
costly decora'ions. When darkness fell
an illumination burst forth on such a
stupendous scale that it took away the
breath even of Parisians, but everywhere
in the panting, pushing throngs of sight
seers one heard people saying: "To think
that all this is done because one little man
happens to be the son of his father I"
This remark was heard hundreds of
times if once. It remains in mind, now
that the lights are all out and the flags
are disappearing, as a c'jw to what France
really felt during the fetes. It all had to
be done, do doubt, and the French were
not the people to do it by halves, but this
curious mental reflection on the strange
conditions imposed by an alliance with
hereditary autocracy seemed always up
permost.
Among the people, doubtless, it found
expression the more readily because a
vague notion is spreading that the whole
thing 19 pa.rt of a scheme to estrange the
republic It required a good deal of
moral courage for the Czar to mate tbe
Orleanist Princes, their newly found
friend, the Princess Mathilde, and Jheir
princely supporters of the houses of Uzes,
Luynes, Rochefoucauld, Rohan and the
rest, the chief figures at his luncheon on
Wednesday, wiiich was the only meal
where he had the naming of his own
guests. The Paris papers said as little as
possible In regard to this, but it was pri
vately taiked about more than anything
else. In the matter of physical deport
ment, however, Nicholas gave the impres
sion of being the reverse of brave. The
oldest Parisian had never seen his guests
Vho passed everywhere within their
streets, so walled with bayonets or civic
horses at a sharp trot. There had been
olaborats arrangements for & state proces
sion to the opera-house, moving at a wait
and with six caparisoned horses, each led
by a footman, but at the last moment this
plan was changed and the cortege was
rushed through swiftly.
Public rumor ascribed this to the terrorÃ
of the Czar, though much more likely it
was due to the nervousness of the police
authorities of Paris. All who came close
to the Czar saw him quivering with a kind
of stage fright, which affected him
throughout the visit. His awkward way,
too, both puzzled and annoyed the crowd,
which had memories of traditions of an
Emperor who doffed his hat and bowed
and smiled when he drove through Paris.
It was this that chilled the enormous
throngs gathered to witness tbe Czar's en
trance on Tuesday. It was well placed on
the Champs Elysees, opposite the Palais
de L'lndustrie, and where the biggest
crowd was. The papers talked of "tre
mendous cheering," but really, save for
the white-robed Tunisian Sneiks, there
was little or none. By night-time the
crowd had found its voice and could raise
a sort of cheer, but at the outset it was
almost dumb. Tbe Empress also at the
beginning was white as a sheet and visi
bly trembling. She bowed as if she was a
piece of mechanism. It seems, however,
that s c had been hideously seasick the
day before and was in no condition that
morning for the ideal of facing Paris. She
had recovered, and she was inspired by
her unparalleled surroundings to play
ideally well her part. Next day all Paris
was talking about her.
It is nearly thirty years since French
men had seen a beautiful woman bowing
from an open royal carriage and the sight
went to their hearts. O(d imperialists
wept openly at the spectacle and the
memories it evoked, while the younger
generation in turn was moved by this.
The laying of tbe bridge foundation on
Wednesday became exclusively the
Czarina's affair. The Czar and President
Faure took part in the ceremony, but the
crowd had eyes and voices for her alone.
She was affected to tears by the stress of
the situation, but she bore herself mag
nificently none tne less, and hundreds of
thousands of people yelled "Vive l'lm
peratrice," a s' und which the Seine Val
ley had not Heard since 1870.
Who shall say what results are to fol
low tbis extraordinary demonstration?
In ordinary times Frenchmen talk a great
Heai about Egypt, the Niger and other
English complications as if they con
stituted the principal items of French
foreign politics. Now, for a week, one has
beard not a whisper of all this. In the
presence of the tremendous fact that the
Czar was actually in Paris there cou:d
be only one thought, and that one was of
Germany.
The statue of Strasbourg, draped afresh
in mourning, was tbe point for which
every group of visiting provincials made
first. In the Place de la Concord, the
thought of "Revanche" sprang up auto
matically in every mind as the ultimate
meaning of these flags and firewort3.
Perhaps some of the poignancy of terror
that marked the seventies is lacking now,
but "Revanche" is still a realty in the
French, and "Egypt" is merely froth on
French lips. If next week France
learned that she had been committed by
her Foreign Office to an Anglo-Russian
combination, she would not turn a hair,
but if the Berlin and Vienna press has
failed to say spiteful things about her
welcome to the Czar, and' had not re
vealed the conviction that it meant mis
chief to the triple alliance, she would
have been sorely disappointed.
It is curious that while Paris was firing
in honor of the Czar, General Trochu, the
man whose famous plan for relief of the
besieged city in the terrible year of 1870
kept all the world in weary suspense, lay
dying at Tours. His Russian experiences
dated back to a dangerous wound which
he had received in an assault on tbe
central bastion of Sebaslopol in the Cri
mean War.
Tne cry of "Vive l'lmperatrice" might
have reminded him of that critical day
when he pledged his Breton honor to de
fend the woman who last bore the name
of Empress of France. His so-called plan,
considering the awful medley of material
which he had to work upon, was unfairly
criticized and ridiculed. The Trochu of
that to-morrow men dream of in France
will have ready to his hands different
weapons indeed.
Englishmen are still as much m the
dark as ever as to what business, if any,
Lord Salisbury transacted with the Czar
at Balmoral last week. Public sentiment
was a good deal attracted by the notion
of an Angio-Franco-Russian arrangement,
and certain signs of amelioration in the
feeling of the Paris and St. Petersburg
press toward England arc &eized upon
wit avidit" as warranting the belief that
this is imrendinp. Nothing has happened
since the Balmoral meeting either to con
firm or to disprove this idea, and mean
while popular feeling is reverting to the
after imuulse to have England keep her
bands free to act in Turkey upon her own
initiative. This is what the English al
ways prefer to do if ihey are quite sure the
continental powers are divided into hos
tile camps.and in proportion as Russia and
France geem to be angering Germany and
Austria by their demonstrative honey
moon, the "British instinct to hold aloof
a.nd play between these rival alliances re
vives its force.
To every politician of sense whom I
know Lord Roseberry's choice of an issue,
and even more of a time for a rupture
with his party, is quite inexplicablp. Pos
sibly there may oe a mystery behind it,
but to the ordinary vision he seems to be
rrore Tory than Lord Salisbury himself,
and he resigns his titular leadership be
cause the Liberals are saying what the
Duke of Norfolk, the present Postmaster-
General, does not hesitate to say at a pub
lic meeting. His action gives to the baser
sort of Tory papers a chance to insist that
the Radicals are using the Armenian busi
ness for partisan purposes, but this hardly
matters, and really the same thing may
be said of Roseberry himseif.
From the day when Lord Roseberry was
foisted by an underhanded intrigue
upon his party the=-e dispatches have
maintained his unfitness for the position
of leader, and for a year at least, even
those who helped him to rise have ad
mitted their error. His retirement is of in
terest as saving the Liberal party from the
embarrassment of throwins him out, but
ju-t now there is so little left of tbe
Liberal party anyway that its officering
is of slight importance.
In the suitable surroundings given by a
somewhat gaudy music hall stage, that of
the Empire Theater at E iinburgh, Lord
Roseberry held up to ridicule last night
every proposal made by Mr. Gladstone for
the solution of the Armenian question.
Lord Roseberry's speech consisted in great
part of a dull philosophic and political
lecture, and this was varied only by ex
pressed or implied attacks on Gladstone,
Harcourt and other unnamed Liberals.
These attacks were sugared by sweet re
ferences to tbe old man whom ha was
wounding so deeply. The speech is the
most astounding confession of the impo
tence of England that was ever made in
public by any English statesman. That
Lord Kosa berry should have selected this
time, so dangerous and difficult for his
country, to do this thing proves up to the
hilt that he is neither a really great Lib
eral statesman nor a true patriot. An ad
mirable breeder of race horses, but a fee
ble, livid and vacillating leader of men, he
has don 6 his best to undo any good effects
the visit of the Czar to this country might
have produced by declining the practical
co-operation of Russia. The only thing
that was needed to complete the mixed
comedy and tragedy of last evening's en
tertainment was a" telegram containing
the Sultan's warmest thanks, followed by
a suitable dirge for the dead anl dying
Christians whom England, according to
the principal speaker, is now powerless to
protect.
At the railway station at Lechlade, a
quaint, peaceful, medieval village far up
the Thames, above Oxford, a harvest cart
was waiting Wednesday morning. The
cart had yeilow wheels and was lined with
moÂ«. Willows and vines bad been
twisted about its frame. The loving
hands of th<- friends bore what once was
William* Morris from the train to this bed'
of moss, and then gently to his last home
under the elms at Kelmscott Church,
which was decorated as for a harvest fes
tival. There was no other gloom or con
ventional sadness, and all was as the dead
poet would have himself wished it.
Up to late Wednesday night George dv
Maurier's colleagues, who were then as
sembled around Punch's weekly dinner
table, had been led by the latest bulletins
from him to hope that ''Kicky," his pet
familiar name in the circle, would live to
be once more among them, with his glori
ous spirits and quick flashes of humor.
Yet those high spirits had sunk some
what of recent months, possibly from fail
ing health. Dv Manner had never been
quite the same man since the publication
of "Trilby."
That wonderful success brought never
ending demands on his time and energy,
and his great unselfish nature could not
resist. Dv Maurier was ever haunted by
a fear lest blindness should overtake
him, and the misfortune of many years
ago when tbe sight of his left eye was lost
remained always before him. This par
tial deprivation of sight was in some sense
a gain to the artist, as he had to draw on
a iarge scale on account of it, and those
drawings became in all senses of high
value. It is curious that he was not tne
only artist on the staff of Punch who suf
fered in the same way, and it was a favor
ite joke of Tenniels that he and Dv Mau
rier had but a pair of eyes between them.
Something has been said of Dv .Mau
rier's cynicism, but never was there a
gentler cynic He laid a firm, kind hand
on the weaknesses and snobbish philistine
tendencies of the Englishmen of his day,
but even those at whom lie laughed were
most ready to laugh themselves. He never
tnok hi? literary powers quite seriously,
.Â«nl only regretted that others who hÂ«
honestly beiieved were greater than him
self had no such successful boom. He was
the kindest of satirists, the most loyal of
friends. Men and dogs all loved him, and
it is not many winters since he waded
through broken ice at some serious per
sonal risk to save a little drowning dog.
An interchange of courtesies between
the Pope and the Queen has highly grati
fied the English Catholics. The two are
oid friend*, for just fiity years aeo the
tben Mgr. Pecci visited the Queen in Lon
don. The Pope's graceful congratulations
on ttie length of Victoria's reign have
drawn from the latter striking acknowl
edgments of the felicity and loyalty of her
Catholic subjects to their sovereign.
The saddest reports, I regret to say,
reach me from the west of Ireland about
the injury done to crops by floods and
ram. The crops are practicallj destroyed
in some districts, and everything threat
ens a winter famine in certain parts of
Ireland unless speedy relief is given.
English members of Parliament have
been peculiarly unlucky in the last few
days, ami no less than three of them have
been badly damaged in carriage accidents.
One of the three, H. Byron Reed, the
member for East Bradford, has since died.
Mr. Reed was a better journalist than
politician. At one time he was editor of
the Darlington North Star. People have
been lound who suggest that Mr. Glad
stone should fill Mr. Reed's now vacant
place, but it is in the highest degree im
probable that such a course will be
adopted.
What with an international political
explosion and a furious outside warring
of the elements, bringing the storms and
wrecks of tbe week jusi passed, English
men would almost have forgotten Ger
many and their candid critical friend, the
German Emperor, were it not for the fact
that they have been steadily rubbed the
wrong way by the virulent attacks of the
Hamburger Nachrichten on the defective
material organization of the Britisu army.
The last of the-e attacks characterizes the
British as intriguers, who are constantly
undermining the peace of Europe, and it
jubilantly proclaims that the British
army is insufficient to protect the mother
country or the colonies. More of this
from the sume source may confidently be
expected, especially as British writers are
asking with malice what may be the na
ture of the secret understanding between
the Emperor and the Sultan, which they
decline to believe is confined solely to a
courteous interchange of photographs.

Pains in the Head
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 10.â Letters and
telegrams of sympathy with Mr. and Mrs.
Castle, the Americans who were arrested
on October 7 on the charge of stealing a
number of valuable furs, continue to ar
rive at the United States embassy. Em
bassador Bayard has given his full ap
proval of the action taken by Secretary
Roosevelt in behalf of Mr. and Mrs. Castle,
and the Scotland Yard authorities also
approve his course. A London physician,
who recently attended Mrs. Castle profes
sionally, will testify when the case comes
up in the Great Marlborough-street Police
Court on Tuesday. October 13, that Mrs.
Castle has been suffering from acute head
ache and a feeling of intense f atgue, al
though she has not undergone any exer
tion.
Secretary Roosevelt visited Mr. and Mrs.
Castle in Halloway Jail last evening. He
found the husband completely broken
down. Mr. Castle said to Mr. Roosevelt
that he wished to thank his many friends
in the United States and England for
their sympathy and kindness, and to
assure them that their confidence in him
would never be misplaced.
Mrs. Castle is very much depressed and
suffered to-day from acute pains in the
head. It was impossible to hold an in
terview with her for any length of time
and her mental condition was very un
atisfactory.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 10.â A dispatch
to-morning paper from London concern
ing the arrest there of Mr. and Mrs. Walter
M. Castle says:
Their solicitor frankly admitted Mrs.
Castle's guilt. Michael Abrahams, their
solicitor, is a criminal lawyer of wide ex
perience and great ability. He declared
to-day :
"I have had herexamined by some lead
ing specialists in mental disorders and
have no doubt that the Judge will admit
that her symptoms are such as to warrant
a defense of kleptomania.
"She suffers from pain in the head,
from complete loss of memory and from
other singularities, which, accord
ing to medical science, are well
known to be frequently associated
with delusions. Her case will be decided
in a month or six weeks. We shall apply
for bail for her again next Wednesday,
and I hope she will be released on the
bond we can offer.
"The whole fact of the matter, in short
is, that Mrs. Castle did take these articles,
but her husband is perfectly innocent of
any knowledge whatever of her doing so."
LIKE A FAMILY WELCOME
Czar and Czarina Greeted Upon
Their Arrival in West
ern Germany.
Evangelical Clergy of Hesse Decli&c
to Take Any Share in the
Reception.
DARMSTADT, Germahy, Oct. 10.â The
Czar and Czarina arrived here at 9 o'clock
this morning. A large crowd of people
assembled at tbe station and greeted their
arrival with hearty cheers. Their ma
jesties entered a carriage and were driven
to the new palace.
Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig, brother of
the Czarina, has appointed the Czar
honorary colonel of the Twenty-fourth
Regiment of Hessian Dragoons of the
German army. The reception of the Czar
and Czarina at the railway station par
took more of the nature of a family wel
come than a state function.
Later there was a more ceremonious re
ception at tbe palace, to which all the
high state and military officers and church
dignitaries were invited. The Czarina,
wnen Princess Alix of Hesse, was a
Lutheran, bat subseauent to her be
trothal to the Czar she changed her re
ligion, becoming a member of the ortho
dox Greek church. Tbe evangelical clergy
of Hesse did not approve of this step and
they, therefore, declined to take any
share in the reception to their Majesties
to-day.
FATHER STRICKLAND'S BOOK.
It Contains Home J\eu> Information He-
fating to British Claims in Feneeutla.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 10.â Father Strick
land has issued a book on the Venezuelan
boundary, based on documents and maps
found in the archives of the Capuchin
order. The book tends to the conclusion
that the rights of Great Britain as far as
the Schomburgk line are irrefragable,
and that regarding the region beyond the
line Great Britain had as much right as
Venezuela.
Tbe documents establish indubitably
the Dutch right on the whole coast to and
including Point Barima, and also the
parts far in the hinterland. They show
that tbere are certain tracts in different
parts of Venezuela and Guiana which
were not seized by either the Dutch or
Spaniard;, and the present ownership of
these, Father Strickland contends, can
only be settled by diplomacy or arbitra
tion.

KAISER WILLIAM
GREATY IRRITATED
Not at All Pleased With the
Friendship Between Rus
sia and France.
Could Not Conceal His Wrath
Upon Learning of the Words
of the Czar.
WHAT 'PRECIOUS BONDS/MEANS
Important German Legislation Consid
ered at a Meeting of the
Crown Council.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 10.â The Kron
rath, or Crown Council, which was held at
Hubertusstock on Wednesday at the sum-
mons of the Kaiser was a very important
event, inasmuch as it formulated the pol
icy of the Government in regard to the
legislation which is to be submitted to the
Reichstag at the next session of that body,
on November 10.
Such a council is very rare, only two be
ing held since IS9O, when a Kronrath pre
ceded the dissolution of the Reichstag and
the resignation of Prince Bismarck from
the Imperial Chancellorship. It is learned
by the United Associated Presses that the
council held this week was summoned by
the Emperor at the direction of Prince
Hohenlohe, who believes that the gravest
issues depend upon the coming session of
the Reichstag. The ministers who at
tended the council were unanimous in the
belief that the present Reichstag will re
fguse to grant the naval credit whicD. the
Emperor wants, but they differ as to the
expediency of dissolving that body. This
Reichstag will expire by limitation in 1898,
and many of the ministers are in favor of
waiting and allowing tbe house to die a
natural deatn. The council agreed to con
vert the German 4 per cent bonds into 'â !>%
per cents.
The reply of the Czar to the address of
President Faure at the banquet given in
honor of the Russian Emperor in Paris,
was wired in full to tbe Kaiser, who made
no effort to conceal his irritation upon
learning that the words "precious bonds"
were authentic, and had actually been
used by the Czar in referring to the friend
ship of Russia for *France, thus allowing
the existence of no doubt that an alliance
stronger than a mere entente had been
concluded between Russia and France. It
is now very doubtful whether the Emperor
will meet the Czar at Darmstadt and Ham
burg. The crown council held in Huber
tusstock may result in a change in the
Cabinet, and this possibility is causing a
great deal of uneasiness in official circles.
Observing the grand reception given to
tbe Czar in Paris, German newspapers like
the Berlin Post have tried to boycott the
Parisian events of the last few days, de
scribing tbe journals which printed the
reports and accounts of thÂ« fetes in full as
"sensation mongers."
The National Zeitung says that Ger
many looks without hate or love upon
the most remarkable spectacle that has
ever been witnessed, namely, that of a
republic worshiping an alien autocrat as
a national hero.
The Hamburger Correspondenz, an
official organ, admits that the Czar's
toasts upon the occasion of his entertain
ments in Paris are much warmer than
those given by him in Vienna or Breslau,
which fact, the paper adds, cannot well be.
ignored.
The Bismarckian journals suggest that
if Prince Bismarck were Chancellor Ger
many would not now witness tbe virtual
transfer of the center pivot of European
politics from Berlin to Paris.
German exporters are generally con
vinced that McKinley will be elected
President and that a high tariff in America
wiil follow. Dr. Barth, the German econo
mist, now in tbe United States, wired this
week to the managers of the Deutsche
Bank that theri was no doubt that Mc-
Kinley would be elected.
The Berliner Tageblatt to-day says Mc-
Kinley and a Republican House of Repre
sentatives may be at their hottest for a
hi.h tat iff, but the silver Senate will op
pose them, and therefore there is little
danger that the tariff will be altered for
the next few years.

MYSTERIOUS ESCAPE OF SARELL
How the Convict Sawed His Way Through
Iron Doors Is Worrying the Auburn
Prison Officials.
AUBURN, N. V., Oct. 10.â Seldom have
the officials of Auburn prison met with so
clever and mysterious a disappearance as
confronted them yesterday morning, when
in Lewis Sarell's cell was found on the cot
a dummy of straw topped off with a bunch
of hair. Investigation showed eight
inches of the heavy iron cell door skill
fully sawed off at the bottom, through
which small opening- the convict had
wriggled with great difficulty.
How Sarell obtained egress through sev
eral lociced doors, between his cell and the
prison yard, are matters perplexing the
officials. He did this, however, for in a
distant part of. the prison was found the
only other obtainable clew to the man.
He had attacked a thick iron bolt on a
door in the mess-hall and sawed it
through, but his plans failed in this direc
tion, for there wa3 another bolt on the
other side of the door. Whence he went
from there is the crowning mystery of the
prison.
Sarell is under sentence of twenty-five
years for burglarizing the Westchester
County store of Walarer B. Adams (who
was recently killed by burglars) in the fall
of 1889. He, with another convict, at
tempted to strike for freedom a month
ago, but failed. While in tbe act of scal
ing the walls at night, Sarell fell from the
top of a ladder to the ground, nearly
breaking his neck.
PROMINENT MEN FIGHT.
They Hold a Decisive Set- To in the Chi-
cago Athletic Club.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 10.â Two promi
nent men engaged in a prize- tight at the
Athletic Club late this afternoon for a
purse of $1000 a side.
The participants were Dr. Milton B.
Pine, a prominent North Side physician,
and Fred Swift, a member of the Board
of Trade and of the firm of Schwarz,
Dupee & Co. There has long been a dis
pute between the two men as to their
fighting capabilities, and it resulted in to
day's match.
The men were to have gone four rounds,
but at the end of tbe second Dr. Pine, who
proved to be tbe shiftier of the two,
knocked Swift out by a strong right
hander on the chin. The men were both
heavyweights. George Siler, the well
known sporting man, was referee.
The match was held without the knowl
edge of the authorities, ana much trouble
is promised.
Insanity Is Bray's Plea.
NOBLESVILLE, Ind., Oct. 10.â Albert
Bray, tbe farmer who cut the throats of
his wife and two children, near this place
yesterday, and then cut his own throat,
and who was reported at the time to have
died, regained consciousness this morning
after lingering in a comatose condition all
night. He stated that he had killed his
family, but was insane at the time. No
clearer motive could be ascertained for the
deed. At noon he again lapsed into un
consciousness and cannot survive long.

Cremated in Its
Bed. .
The Crazed Father Attempts to
Dash Through Fire to
the Rescue.
FIGHTS THOSE WHO HOLD HIM
Made a Raving Maniac by the Hor
rible Fate That Befell the
Child.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 10.â Fire in the
town of Oakdale last night destroyed the
dwelling of James Gardner, burned to
death his 12-year-old son, made the father
a raving maniac and rendered the wife
a broken-hearted creature. The fire was
caused by the explosion of a coal oil lamp,
and the dwelling went up as though it
were tinder.
Mrs. Gardner wa3 at church when the
explosion occurred. The child was in its
cot, and the father was sitting by the bed
side dozing. The lamp exploded very
suddenly, and the naming oil spread over
the room. Mr. Gardner's clothing re
ceived a large quantity of it, and ;both he
and his son were soon ablaze.
The father seemed at once to lose his
wits. He tried to extinguish the flames
around'his person and in tbe excitement
forgot all about the boy, who by that time
must have, been writhing in agony. Mr.
Gardner rushed from the house into the
street, all the while fighting the element
which was burning his clothing and cook
ing his flesh. In his frenzy he did not
think of the child until he had extin
guished the flames upon himself, and
tben the building was ail ableze.
Then the presence of his son in the
burning structure flashed upon his mind.
In his wild excitement he started to rush
back into the building to rescue the little
one. By that time a crowd of townspeo
ple had gathered, and when they saw the
frenzied man start to re-enter the build
ing they seized Lim. He fought to tear
himself away from their grasp, but several
men took hold of him and held him
fast. He was too excited to speak. No
one thought that the father was strug
gling to rescue his child. They supposed
that he wanted to save some of the furni
ture and effects and they knew that that
was useless.
The charred remains of the child were
found in the ruins of the burning build
ing. The father was still out of his nvnd
at intervals to-day, believing his boy still
alive.

THE TRAGEDY IN
SUISUN VALLEY
Motive for the Killing of
Rancher Wilson Still
in Question.
Officers Lose the Trail of the
Assassin Not Far From
the House.
STORY OF EIS HOUSEKEEPER
Attempt Mads Early at Night to
Lore the Old Man to the
Door.
SUISUN, Cal., Oct. 10.â The circum
stances leading to the murder of Rancher
Daniel H. Wilson in Suisnn Valley last
evening are clothed in mystery. Since
they were notified the officers have been
working on every possible clew, but their
efforts, so far, have proved unavailing.
They are, however, in possession of infor
mation which may possibly lead to Im
mediate arrests.
Owing to domestic wrangles "Wilson and
his wife separated in 1893 as the result of
divorce proceedings. Since that time
Wilson kept various housekeepers. At the
time of tae murder Mrs. Lucy Owens and
her niece, Ada Rice, were in the house.
According to Mrs. Owens' story Wilson
returned from Suisun about 8 o'clock in
the evening. After eating supper he sat
down at his desk and commenced figur
ing on his accounts. Mrs. Owens and her
niece retired to their chamber.
Fifteen minutes later Mrs. Rice passed
through the room in which Wilson was
seated to go to a pump back of tbe house
for a drink of water. Seeing that the
woman was but partially dressed, Wilson
said he would get the water for her; but
Ehe, observing that he was busy, went for
it herself. Ou re-entering the house she
saw Wilson coming out, and when she
stepped inside and placed the key in the
door Wilson laughingly remarked:
'â¢Do not lock me out."
No sooner had these words passed his
lips than the report of a gun was heard
and Wilson fell on the alleyway between
the main residence and a smaller build
ing, exclaiming:
â¢'My God, Lucy, I'm shotl"
The women ran to the Hatch residence I
near by and tbe news of the tragedy was \
telephoned to Suisun. After the officers
had arrived on the scene they traced the
footprints of the assassin for three
quarters of a mile and then lost the trail.
Mrs. Owens stated that prior to the
shooting some one threw a clod on the
porch, but Wilson, being somewhat deaf,
did not hear it. When told about it he
said that if any more clods were thrown
he would go out with his shotgun. Â«
It was rumored here last evening that
WiUon yesterday received the money for
his almond crop, but tha firm to which he
sold the almonds stated that he was not
paid any part of tbe money. It is believed
by some that robbery was the motive for
the crime, this surmise arising from the
fact that Wilson yesterday discharged
ar.d paid off his employes and was likely
to have had money in hii possession.
There is no evidence so far to show that
the murdered man had any bitter enemy.
Wilson was a native of Ohio and was 52
years of ace. He was a member of the
local Grand Army of the Republic Post
and had resided in the valley for twenty
years. He was regarded as an honest,
upright man. Wilson leaves two chil
dren â a boy, about 1G years old, who is
hunting in Mendocino, and a girl about 15
years of age.
The cowardly murder has been the sole
topic of conversation on the streets of
t-uisun to-day and all sorts of rumors
have been started, each found to be with
out foundation when investigated by the
officers. Deputy Coroner Maynard im
paneled a jury tnis morning and then ad
journed the inquest until Monday.

MONTATILOR'S SCHOOL ROW.
Uprising of Parents Aaatnot the Parti
san Acts of a Teacher.
PORTLAND, Ob.. Oct 10.â Miss Emma
Rinequist, a schoolteacher of Montavilla
suburb, has created an incipient rebellion
in her school district. She is reported as
having said a few days ago that if McKin
ley emblems worn by her pupils were not
disposed of she would take them up her
self, as she did not want McKinJey but
tons in her school. Bryan buttons she de
clared "All right enough." The decree to
take off the buttons provoked no end of
complaint, and some of the little standard
bearers said they would not do it until
forced. Accordingly the teacher collected
all the buttons and threw them into the
sewer.
When the Montavilla parents learned
what bad taken place at school, there be
gan a whirlwind of indignation which is
rapidly growing in diameter and increas
ing in force. They threaten to petition
for Miss Rinquist's removal on the
ground of "offensive partisanship."

AT CHICAGO HEADQUARTERS.
Democrats and Republicans Busy Figur
ing Out Expected Victor Us.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 10.â Headquarters
gossip to-day was mainly of the great
parades yesterday and last night. The
managers of both parties seemed well
satisfied with the showing made.
At Republican headquarters the num
ber of men in line were expatiated upon,
while across the street the Democrats
claimed virtually all the enthusiasm, and
that the difference in numbers was due to
many Democrants being compelled by
their employers to march in tne afternoon
and being of course too weary to join in
tiie night demonstration as their sympa
thies would have led them to do.
The daily bulletin from Democratic head
quarters announce that every day brings
fresh acquisitions to the standard of Bryan
and free silver, not only throughout the
West but in Chicago. Among the promi
nent citizen* who have come out strong
in favor of Bryan are ex-President Frank
Wenter of the Chicago Sanitary Board
and Michael Brennan, ex-Chief of Police.
Mr. Wenter, who is popular among the
Germans and has a large following, will
speak for Bryan and Altgeld during the
remainder of the campaign. His support,
I it is asserted, will bring to that cause
thousands of votes. Mr. Brennan was
I Chief of Police during the strike of 1894.
and knows all about the conditions lead
ing up to it.
"In Western Springs, a suburban town
seventeen miles west of Chicago," says the
bulletin, "there is not a single adherent
of McKinley. Two months ago 160 of the
180 voters there were for McKinley. Of
the twenty-six German Catholic priests in
Chicago, twenty-three are pronounced for
Bryan, free silver and humanity. About
the same proportion exists in the Protest
ant German churches. This is a result of
an actual canvass, and is a refutation of
the charge that the Germans are for the
gold standard.
"Some remarkable figures are brought
out by Republican claims that wheat had
advanced because of the belief that Me-
Kinlev's election is assured. It is stated
that when Vermont went Republican
wheat fell 2]Â£ points. When Arkansas
went Democratic wheat went up 2 points,
when Maine went Republican wheat fell 2
points, when Bismarck's letter appeared
wheat went up 12 points; when toe Re
publican managers in September were
claiming everything wheat slumped from
70 to 66 cents and fell steadily until the
election returns came in from Georgia and
Florida, when it recovered to 69J^.J
"The conclusion drawn is that anybody
who will study dates will find this state
ment is true; it means that wheat will be
$1 a bushel when Bryan is elected."
The charge that Hon. Richard Bland is
sulking in his tent is refuted, it being
stated that Mr. Bland has written to
headquarters that he is physically unable to
make any speeches outside of his own Con
gressional district. In his letter Mr.
Bland expresses his great regret that he is
unable to take the stump. He further
states tnat had he personally the naming
of the man to lead the free silver forces
his choice would have been William
Jennings Bryan.
Governor AJtgeld called on Chairman
Jones to-day. He assured the chairman
that Bryan will come up to Cook County
with not less than 40,000 majority and be
lieves it may reach 50,000. He predicts a
large majority in Cook County also.

GREETING TO GROVE JOHNSON.
Monster Parade Followed by an En
thusiastic Meeting in the
Pavilion.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 10.â The great
est political demonstration that has taken
place here in years was that of to-night,
when Congressman Grove L. Johnson ad
dressed the people of Stockton in tne
Agricultural Pavilion. Four trainloads of
uniformed members of the Republican
clubs of Sacramento arrived before 8:30
o'clock and marched through the streets
in torchlight procession. The electric
lights with which the streets were deco
rated during the Native Sons celebration
were turned on to-night, and the principal
thoroughfares were ablaze with light.
Crowds began to throng the pavilion as
early as 7 o'clock. The human stream
continued to pour into the great building
until it was filled to overflowing long be
fore the arrival of the Sacramento clubs
and the speakers.
Tne visitors came down from the capital
city fully 3000 strong. Never before in
the history of Stockton have so many uni
formed members of any political organiza
tions been seen upon its streets. From
the ten machine-shop clubs there were
17S0 members in line.
The united assembly clubs sent down
150 men in uniforms and 350 others wear
ing badges. The Capitol employes were in
evidence with umbrellas, slouch hats and
leggings. The Army and Navy League
sent 150 representatives, and the Resolutes,
the best drilled club in the State, were 120
strong. Fully 1600 of the visiting mem
bers of the Republican clubs were in
uniform. They occupied two trains of
twelve cars each, and two trains of fifteen
cars each.
The procession stretched from the depot
to the pavilion and along the side streets,
even before the last two train loads reached
Stockton. By that time the pavilion was
packed to the doors, and there was no
room in it for the visitors. The paraders
were so numerous that the procession got
into a tangle because of its length, and it
was late before the meeting was opened.
The streets were lined with people gathered
to watch the torch-bearers, ana there has
never been so large a crowd out save on
the day of the Native Sons' celebration.
It was past 9 o'clock when the first con
tingent arrived at the pavilion, escorted
by the Sixth Regiment band of this city.
It was tbe McKinley and Hobart Olub of
Stockton, and it marched about the hall,
while tbe thousands in the audience stood
on their seats. They were foilowed by
Chairman T. M. Nelson of the County
Central Committee, Hon. Grove L. John-
son, P. A. Buell and Colonel George B.
Bperry. As the present Congressman from
this district mounted the platform some
one cried, "Three cheers for Grove L.
Johnson 1" and the cry was taken up with
a will. The Johnson Club was the next
to enter the ball. As it passed before the
platform it gave three rousing cheers for
the speaker of the evening.
Chairman Nelson of the County Central
Committee introduced as chairman of the
meeting P. A. Buell. He declared that to
night's demonstration was one of laboring
men. The Republican Glee Club of Sac
ramento entertained the throng with sev
eral selection*. A number of vice-presi
dents were named and took their seats on
the platform â all leading men of the
community in business and professional
circles. By this time fully 5000 people
were in the ball â all that could be accom
modated on tne main floor, the galleries
being closed.
Chairman Buell's allusion, in his speech
of introduction, to the good work done
by Congressman Jonnson, was roundly ap
plauded. It was some time before John
son could speak as he stepped forward in
response to tne introduction, so loud was
the outburst of applause that greeted him.
In opening, he thanked the brawny
armed laborers of Sacramento who wel
comed him so warmly to-night Sacra
mento and San Joaqnin, tie said, were
sister counties, with kindred interests, and
should stand side by side in an effort for
sound money and William McKinley.
Tne allusion to the Republican candi
date for the Presidency started the cheer
ing again. He referred to the Democrats
as the "late Democratic party," and upon
its shoulders he placed the blame for the
present distress. The present administra
tion he scored roundly, much to the pleas
ure of hia auditors.
The crowd was delighted from start to
finish with Johnsons address, and he
made many friends here by it He was
followed by Rev. Anna Shaw in a brief ad
dress on suffrage.
THE START FOR STOCKTON.
Ten Thousand People Crowd the Depot to
â¢ , Overflowing. Â '.'
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 10. â The
depot ; was ;= crowded ?to overflowing ; this
evening when five trains with forty-eight
cars started with the local Republican
clubs and their â â¢ friends on the excursion
to Stockton to attend the great Johnson
meeting. Fully 5000 people went on the
trains -. and fully as many more watched
them depart. . Seventeen hundred men
belonging to the marching clubs, two
tnirds of them from the railroad shops,
formed in line in the yards and marched
to the cars. Each of the clubs in the city
has its distinctive uniform and they pre

asm was manifested both by the excur
sionists and f those who saw them off, and
the air was rent with lusty cheers for
Johnson and the rest of the ticket. .

clubs from the > shops and the Army and

BANNA IN INDIGNANT.
In Circulating false Reports Democrat!
Shew Their Weakness.
CHICAGO. 1n.., Oct. mâChairman
Hanna^is highly r indignant over the re
port recently given circulation from the
Democratic National Headquarters that
he had given tip the election of MaÃiniey.
Mr. Hanna to-day received a letter from
California asking him if the report was
true. To the United Associated Presses
the chairman said he had not enough ad
jectives to properly express his denial of
the report, and he thought it showed a
very weak cause when his opponents had
to resort to such tactics as the dissemin
ation of such outrageous stories.
Mr. Hanna expressed himself as much
gratified at the sound-money parade of
yesterday. "It shows," said he, "that the
working men â that is, the intelligent,
thinking class of themâ are for McKinley,
and leaves no doubt as to what will be the
result in November."
The week ending to-day has been the
busiest since the beginning of the cam
paign so far as the speakers' department
at headquarters is concerned. Colonel
Hahn said to-day that he bad made
more assignments for speakers this week
than foi the last three months, and that
for the next three weeks he expects to ex
cel his record. Reports from Messrs. But
terworth and Schoonmaker, wno are in
California, being the first orators ever
sent to the Pacific Coast by the Repub
lican National Committee, are full of
enthusiasm, and state the largest meet
ings ever held on the coast are taking
place daily. The California State Com
mittee has sent a request to Mr. Hahn
asking for an extension of Mr. Butter
worth's time in that State, but this was
impossible, and Mr. Butterworth will go
next week to Oregon and Washington as
previously arranged.
Congressman Dingley of Maine, who
has been speaking in Indiana, was in the
city to-day. He reports that State safe
for McTKinkley and sound money.
Congressman Boutelle of Maine is ex
pected to reach here to-morrow and unless
his itinerary is changed he will go on to
the States of Washington, Oregon and
California. It is expected that Mr. Bou
telle will start for the coast on the 13th or
14th inst., and will remain there until the
close of the campaign.
Speaker Reed has been assigned to In
diana for three speeches, one of which will
be delivered at Peru on the ISth.
Ex-President Harrison, it is definitely
announced, will make several speeches in
Indiana within the next ten days. It is
not yet determined where these speeches
will be made.
The Union Generals' train has arrived
here and the generals spoke to-night at
Pullman.
George R. Gaither Jr., one of the Repub
lican leaders in Baltimore, reports to
headquarters that there is no need for the
slightest worry in regard to the situation
in Maryland. Everything is most prom
ising, he says, and the State is sure for
McKinley.

SANTA BARBARA'S
GIFT TO CHARITY
Pretty Hospital in Which
Sick Children Will
Be Cared For.
Public-Spirited Women Provide
Another Blessing for
the Ailing.
HOME FOR LITTLE SUFFEREKS.
An X-Ray Entertainment Planned to
Raise More Money to Fit
It Out.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 10.â A
new and important addition is being made
to the Cottage Hospital, that beautiful
home for the sick provided some years ago
through the public spirit of Santa Barbara
women. The hospital is not only liberally
patronized by Eastern invalids who seek
this coast to recruit their failing health,
but has proved a great blessing to resi
dents as well, in cases where surgical
operations become necessary. The operat
ing-room equipment is second to none
in America, with plate-glass operating
tables and the most perfect aseptic ap
pliances. The benefits of the hospital
have been freely extended to the poor, and
Jew institutions in the State have so
modestly performed so much in the way
of charity.
Of late several little children have been
numbered among tne patients, and there
was manifest need of a pleasant home, re
tired from the bustle and roar of the larger
buildings, where these little people could
pass their long hours of convalescence or
of suffering in the bright sunshine and
surrounded by companionship and diver
sions benefiting their tender years.
With the Cottage Hospital directors to
conceive a good wort is to put it into
execution, and almost before the public
was aware that such a project was under
contemplation the pretty building was
under way, and stands to-day well nigh
completed, the coziest and most delight
ful little home for sick children in Cali
fornia.
The Cottage Hospital stands in a pleas
ant clearing beside a grove of friendly live
oaks in Santa Barbara's pretty suburb,
Oak Park. The children's building stands
by itself in the ample grounds. It is a
one-storied structure of symmetrical pro
portions but simple architecture, facing
south and southeast, and finished with
staff outside. It contains two large wards,
well lighted, which, when finished, are to
have rounded angles everywhere, so as to
present no lodging place for disease
breeding dust. Large stone mantels over
hang generous tire-places, where wood
tires will sparkle in chilly weather. The
walls will be prettily tinted, and the
larger of the two wards will be furnished
throughout by Mrs. Ralph Radcliffe-
Whiteiiead, a wealthy Montecito lady.
One bed in the smaller ward will be
fitted up by the St. Cecilia Club, which
will probably maintain a tree patient nere
in addition to the one it now supports in
the hospital. A comfortable bathroom
and neat little diet kitchen, the latter to
be furnished by Miss Osborne, and a little
nurses' room, which will be furnished by
C. E. Bigelow's gift, with glass doors com
manding bath wards, occupy the remain
der of the floor space. The most charm
ing feature of the building is the ten-foot
porch running around the south and
southeast front, upon which broad doors
open, so arranged that on all pleasant
days the little cots can be wheeled
upon it.
This children's annex, modest and sim
ple as it is, costs a pretty sum. Three
hundred dollars must yet be found some
where and a unique plan has been con
ceived by the authorities to raise it.
This is no less than an X-ray entertain
ment to be given to the people of the
town^by Richard J. Hall, the physician
under whose direction the hospital has
been conducted for the past year or two,
who has the X-ray in harness, and it has
done wonders at the hospital.
At an X-ray clinic to-day a little child
was brought inâ Little Jim, the pet of the
hospital, a beautiful two-year-old boy who
came thither afflcted with rickets, but
who, under skilled surgery, is acquiring a
very decent pair of legs. These legs were
placed before the Croofces tube, and
through the covering of flesh was seen the
boney structure, now firmly knitting to
gether again after an adroit operation.
The baby, who is used to surgery and
sharp Knives and pain and suffering, bore
the Cimmerian darkness, ibe strained
position and the prolonged inspection
like a wee Trojan, but he heaved a sigh of
relief when it was all over.
All the proceeds of the proposed X-ray
entertainment will be used to tit out toe
Children's Hospital.

SAN FRANCISCO'S LEARNED AND
SKILLED SPECIALIST.
Ten years of successful practice in this city has stamped him as
the master of medicine" and surgery. Medical institutes have
risen and fallen. Specialists have come and gone. Others will
come and go the same as those before them, leaving their patients
poorer and uncured, but Dr. Sweany, through the confidence of
an appreciative people, through the great demands from the sick
and afflicted for his professional services, and through his
unparalleled success in curing disease, has built up an immense
and extensive practice, which has substantially and permanently
established him in this city.
In seeking the services of Dr. Sweany you place yourself under
the care of a highly educated physician, a physician whose ambi-
tion is to excel, whose whole life is devoted to the advancement of
the science of medicine and the relief of suffering humanity.
He has no single remedy which he deals out as a common cure-
all, nor any mechanical contrivance which he heralds to the
world as a remedy for all ills. His medical education condemns
such methods. His lofty aspirations and honesty in practice
place such modern impositions back in the days of witchcraft
and quackery, where they justly belong. Dr. Sweany is a great
student as well as a Doctor. Through constant study and deep
research he is always abreast of the times. There is no new
discovery in medicine, no new apparatus to assist the physician
in treating disease, but what is at his command as soon as
science proves it to be of worth and benefit. Every case that he
undertakes to cure is treated scientifically with such remedies
and such means as in his judgment that particular case requires
in order to effect a speedy and permanent cure. He has no
experiments to make in treating disease, for he is thoroughly
educated and prepared through experience already gained to
accomplish his work in the field of medicine. Ho has given
special attention to all classes and kinds of nervous and private
diseases of both men and women, and has restored to health
many after other methods of treatment and other doctors of
ability failed. Those living away from the city who wish to
avail themselves of Dr. Sweany's professional" services should
always write an unreserved history of their cases, giving every
detail in plain language. He will then render them such advice
as he deems will be of benefit to them. Call or address

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct.
10.â Stanford University and Palo Alto
turned out to-day to listen to the elo
quent Ben Butterworth of Ohio. Excur
sions were run from San Jose, Mountain
View and Redwood City, and over 1800
people were assembled on the grounds
when the speaking began. Inspiring mu
sic was rendered by the university and
Palo Alto bands, and two good addresses
were delivered.
John ~M. Switzer '98, president of the
University Republican Club, presided,
and delivered a snort opening speech, in
which he referred to the large number of
the members of the faculty who had come
fiver to McKinley, while not more than
three or four had announced themselves
for Bryan. He introduced Congressman
Butterworth, who was received with ap
plause.
Congressman Butterworth spoke of the
proposed constitutional amendment grant
ing the electoral franchise to women. He
said that in the BucKeye State women al
ready had a voice in public affairs, and he
was not quite sure but the people were
standing in their own light in not giving
them a vote also. "The hand that rocks
the cradle is the hand that rules the
world," and "The child is father to the
man,' 1 and "A boy is what his mother
makes him," were three epigrammatic
sentences by means of which he summed
up the whole argument in favor of the
amendment. Continuing, he said:
My countrymen, we are here to talk con
cerning what we shall do on the 3d of Novem
ber. We can do one of two th.ngsâ no, we can
vote the Prohibition ticket, but I don't think
that would be wise, for if the country gets
worse they never will succeed, and if it gets
better they will not be needed, so we can do
one of two things. And only one of them is
going to be the right thing, and I am here to
tell you which is the right way, because we
think our way is the best.
No one need be misled as to what he is vot
ing for, because both parties have notified the
world just what they are going to do if ihey
are placed in power. No one doubts that they
will do thisâ that is, if they keep their
promise. Our friends at Chicago have told us
what they are going to do if they get control.
We have, too. Now, which shall you choose?
In the first place there is the question as to
whether we favor a protective tariff system.
College professors generally tell us that a pro
tective tariff is a bad thing and theoretically
I say "Amen," but practically I don't. A man
may tell me that theoretically I have enough
to eat, but practically I might be starving. to
death. That is a question about which I am
better able to judge than he. And so I hope
the people oi â  California have had a lesson
which they certainly understand. Since I
have been in this State I have not found | one
man who has not said to me: "Yes," you are
right ; we have known It for three years, the
change has cost us from ten to twenty million
dollars." MqMpH^l
Mr. 'Wilson, in drafting his tariff bill, be- 1
lieved that it would be all right; he was per-!
fectly sincere. But as ministers say, "There is j
a way that seem t h good to a man, but the end
whereof is death." T* l ÃfifSlFffÃÃg'T*j*T*lE
We were like Nebuchadnezzar, who got rich
and fat and then wanted to kick, but he kicked
himself out. And so in 1890 the people were
lea to believe they ought to have a change,
and they kicked, but they kicked themselves
out.
Then they passed the bill leaving the tariff (
on products of the South, which is unani- I
mously Democratic, and â¢â  taking them off of !
your prunes, your wool, your raisins and j
lemons. But some one says that it is only a
difference of 10 per cent. He is not fair to !
himself. It may not make a very great differ
ence to have a decrease of 10 percent all along
the line, but when it strikes all in one spot as
it did in California it gets us all into trouble
and you feel it. ;
The speaker then , paid his : respects to
Castle, the fusion candidate for Coneress
in the Seventh District, and the revolu- j
tionary speeches which he is making |
throughout the district. He said:
Here our young men who have put on the
norm to defend the Government have been
called the , hired assassins of â¢ plutocrats. I
never knew of such an unbridled exhibition of
impudence. I don't think, men of that stamp
could have any conviction whatever unless it I
be the conviction by twelve men of con
spiracy. The workiugmen, too, he describes
as .'ens and tending to peonage. I didn't
think that there was any part of our country
where a man could stand up before ian audi- i
ence and insult them in that way and yet be
applauded as this man Castle is.
Congressman Batterworth then took up
the money question, and devoted consid
erable time to the discussion of the falla
cies on which the free-silver idea was
based:
We want no circulating medium of blather
skites. We do not need more money, but
more circulation. ; The only way to get out of
debt is to get prosperity. You say "what we
want is that a man.; can go and chuck silver
bullion into one window of the Mint and take
out silver dollars at the other. How will that
help us? Have we any to chucK? This idea
* that the Government stamp makes money is
all rot. If the Government 'can make silver
worth 100 cents it can do the same with pota
toes, wheat or iron. : What makes wheat or po
tatoes at their present value is the amount
that they will bring in the market; and silver
must go the same way.
Now, they say that I am going back on mv
record. But lam doing no such thing. I have
always opposed gold monometallism or any
other kind oi monometallism. , As soon as we
have this free silver they tell us about, we who
ere in debt will go up a flame. We need
sound money, sound credit and an honest
medium, and then we will have prosperity.
The speaker took up the plank of the
Chicago platform, denouncing President
Cleveland and the Supreme Court. ; He
stated most vehemently that Americans
have never yet been a people shackled
hand and foot; that they are not
communists; that they are a liberty
loving people." but believed in liberty with
law. He deplored the extremity to" which
they had 4 been -brought, when such de
nunciatory and incendiary sentiments as
these passed from mouth to moutn.
The address occupied : a little over an
hour in its delivery, and was followed
with marked attention. It was character
ized by 1 - touches of humor, and the
speaker was more than once compelled to
pause until the applause had subsided.
.Following Congressman Butterworth,
Judge Walling, candidate for Presidential
elector on the Republican ticket, spoke for
a few minutes on the financial question.
He is a careful speaker and made a sound
argument for honest finance, 7 his dealing
with the free-silver heresy J. being even
more harsh than that of : the previous
speaker. â¢'â  â *&Â§&

ippropriate transparencies. Senator White

question, dismissing the tariff by saying

LOS ANGELES POLITICS.
Lively Quarrel in the Democratic Conven-
tion Over the Trading With the
Populists.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 10.â The at
tempt at fusion here to-day between the
municipal conventions of the Democrats
and Populists has led to an interminable
confusion, and caused Hon. Burdett Chan
dler to declare in a speech of unusual fire
on the floor of the Democratic body that
this fusion business was rapidly leading
the Democracy to that region which pa
gan Bob Ingersoll says has no real exist
ence. Chandler was opposing the adop
tion of the report submitted by a Popo
cratic committee looking toward "an
equitable division" of offices in this city.
Delegate Chandler was not the only pa
triot in the Democratic convention who
looked with disfavor upon thii trading.
A score of leading Democrats pointed out
the bad faith and worse promises of their
amiable neighbors, the Populists. Refer
ence was made to the lamentable experi
ence of two years ago, when that "young
Jeffersonian Democrat," George Patton,
took a very disconsolate trip up Salt River
in his efforts to go to Congress from this
district.
The scene in the convention during the
consideration of the fusion report was dis
orderly in the extreme. Chairman Dock
weiler had no control over the body, and
for nearly an hour pandemonium reigned.
The resolutions adopted were lengthy
and promised anything and every
thing in the way of reforms and good,
easy times for workingmen, with big pay,
short hours and many other things with
which municipalities have nothing what
ever to do. These beneficent resolutions
were considered so timely and fitting that,
the Populist convention, hearing of them,
sent over and asked consent for a copy at
once.
Under a suspension of the rules M. P.
Snyder, Democratic Councilman from the
Second Ward, was nominated for Mayor,
defeating Dr. Choat after ex-Mayor
Thomas E. Rowan had withdrawn. No
other nominations were made, and both
conventions adjourned to Monday fore
noon.
Ex-Mayor Rowan and his friends are
the maddest men in this end of the State
to-night. Early this forenoon a resolu
tion was rushed through the Populist con
vention connecting Rowan with the water
company. This resolution was in the na
ture of serving notice, in advance, to the
Democrats that under no circumstances
would the Populists indorse his nomina
tion. This compelled Rowan's retirement
and aroused the anger of himself and his
many friends.

Democratic IF. J Munsaker Advocates I
an Honest Currency.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 10.â Hon. |
W. J. Hunsaker, a leading memb.-r of the :
Los Angeles County bar and an old-line ;
Democrat, addressed a large crowd in j
Music Hall this evening under the aus- j
pices of the Young Men's Sound-money j
League of this city. The club members j
attended the meeting in a body hand- |
somely uniformed. The meeting had ;
been especially provided to give the dis- j
tinguished speaker an opportunity to ex- j
plain why he is supporting Major McKin- |
lev in this campaign. His points were '
telling and anything but complimentary I
to the Popocrats who are attempting to
get offices by fair means if they can, but
got them anyway.
The speaker said he was not in sym- j
pathy with those who, while claiming ;
undying friendship for America and j
American institutions, would tarnish its
credit and its sacred honor by foisting a
cheap and discredited money upon the
country. On the question of tariff Mr. ;
Hunsaker said he had not indorsed the j
McKinley bill, but was now willing that
the Republican party should* take the re- I
sponsibility of framing a new tariff iaw \
adequate to the needs of the country.
The plan of running behind with the ex
penditures of the Government, as now, ,
should be remedied at once.

bers of the local Bryan Free Silver Club
occupied seats upon the stage. An escort
of 160 uniformed men escorted Mr. Cutler
from the Occidental Hotel to the hall,
preceeded by a band. Mr. Cutler's speech
was clean and thoughtful, giving Lhe op
position full credit for many reforms and
at no time descending to abuse or even
ridicule.

EXCITEMENT AT LOS GATOS.
Chinese Washhouse Wrecked by in In-
toxicated Hoodlum,
LOS GATOS, Cal., Oct. 10.â Sing Lee's
washhouse was invaded yesterday after
noon by a drunken hoodlum named "Bill"
Smith, who in the short space of a quarter
of an hour wrecked the building and
contents. The loot was exceedingly
thorough, the only articles left intact
about the place being an accumulation of
the week's washing.
Smith assailed the place with brickbats
and rocks, until only the shell of the
building stood. The Chinamen fled in all
directions. Smith was arrested and jailed
and will be dealt with in no easy manner
by the outraged law. What was once a
neat frame building now stands a wreck â
doorless, vnndowless and, worst of all,
minus its favorite joss. The owner of the
building, Banker John W. Leyndon, vows
vengeance on the culprit.

Will Appeal From the Supreme Court
to the People and S;e Who
Are the Democrats.
The Buckley Democracy which, with
the Populists as allies and with Joseph I.
Dimond us leader, has become the "Anti-
Charter" party of the local campaign,
held its big ratification meeting at Odd
Fellows' Hall last night.
In the many speeches that kept the en
thusiasm rou.-ed the charter was much de
JOSEPH L DIMOND, Candidate for Mayor, Assails the New
Charter From the Rostrum.
nounced in fiery phrases, which drew |
cheers and hisses from the audience.
Every speaker gloried that he was with >
the real Democracy of San Francisco, and
the junta and the Supreme Court were
peppered with hot shot.
In spite of rival Democratic mass-meet
ings, the auditorium was failed and half 1
the gaLery seats were occupied, the crowd !
being much greater than at the frosty
Itainey ratification the other night.
Tuere were some able speakers, music, a
few ladies and much "real, old-fashioned
under-dojr Democracy" at the affair. The
last-named element was largely furnished |
by a procession, 300 strong, that Gathered !
on Tar Fiat, lined up behind a band and j
marched to the hah with whoops and a j
forest of transparencies readme: "James
G. Magnire Club, 28th Asm'y Dist.";
"Lawrence Conlon for Assemoly, '.'Sth
Dist."; "Silver Is the Poor Man's
Money"; "Diamond for Mayor," and so
OS. The old silken banner of the famous
Hickory Club was relieved of its cobwebs
and proudly given fresh air once more.
Many of the Populists were there, but
they hau no partnership in the meeting.
They will ratify nearly the same ticket
next Wednesday night."
'lhe stage was crowded with candidates,
banners and nags. Joseph Rothschild,
president of the general committee, ex
pressed pride in the ticket and introduced
as chairman of the evening Dr. James I.
Stanton, who was loudly cheered. He
tha' they were there fighting for the
cause of Democracy and against an instru
ment designed to tane the elective f an
chise from over 60,000 citizens by making
the Mayor a Czar. The speaker referred
to the "Monarch of the Dailies,"wheieat a
s:orm of hisses arose.
Joseph I. Dimond was cheered again
and at am, ana nearly every sentence he
spoke wa- a>. V'lauded. His vigorous ad
cress was in effect as follows:
He must be of colder blood than the Celtic i
blood which flows in my veins who could â 
sand unmoved in tbe face of ihe reception |
you have given me. But tins reception is not j
for me, but for the official and the candidate.
I am your candidate because the people ap
prove my service.
I feel honored by the nomination. You may
have heard some doubts that lam really in
the fight. I am gratified at having now my
first public ppp'-rtunity to say to my friends
that 1 am in the *ight to stay until the' last bal
lot is cast, [riieers and tries," We are in the
fi?ht with you."l
I wili tut oriefly refer to some things I would !
like to discuss at greater length. It has been '.
questioned v. hich is tne true local Democratic i
party. There is one true test. The true Demo- !
cratic party in this City is the party in favor of
vim â n(t William J. nnings Bryan in the Presi- j
dential chair. Our platform briefly is, first, j
that we are opposed to any law that will
hamper the rignts of any citizen. Our second
Important plank is that tbe new charter shall
be crushed.
I tipper before you as tbe candidate of the
Silver Democratic party. We are this year
nearer lo the people than ever before, and lam
proud to be the People's party candidate as
well as the Democratic candidate.
Tbe Supreme Court has said that we are not
the Democratic party. Now we will appeal
from that decision to the people, who will say
in November who are the Democratic party.
We reiiffirin the work of ihe Chicago conven
tion. Has the other side done to? Out of this
movement must come the Democratic party of
the tunire or the Democratic party will die.
There is before us a great question which is'
lhe most important local issue of this cam
laign. If this new charter is adopted by the
iieople they will mate 'heraselves slaves of the
bosses, li will enable bosses and corporations
to put on your necks a band you will not be
able to throw off. Have you considered the
position the charter places the Mayor in, and
the position it paces you in? It takes from
you the privilege of naming your own officers
and Rive* it to one man with 3000 people to
bold him in power. It is un-American and un
democratic.
It even tells you where you shall educate
rour children and where you shall not educate
them. It tells the citizens of this land that
even thoueh they are Americans for ten gen
erations and come here and live and labor,
they cannot be employed in our public schools.
They say the charter can be amended. How?
First Is required the votes of nine Supervis
ors; second, three-fifths of the people; third, a
majority of both houses oi the Legislature. Do
you think it could ever be nmended?
I have been told that I represent the people
who aie responsible for the split in the Demo
cratic party, and taat il our enemies are suc
cessful we will be to b'.atne. Now I will tell a
story that has not been told before. Three
months ago, before I was an aspirant for any
office. I thought that 1 would individually be
Justified In tryinf to bring about a union of
tbe party. I waited on several friends in this
wing of the party and suggested that five
honorable, eminent and disinterested Demo
crats be asked to lake the party completely in
their own hands and create a new organiza
tion at an open primary controlled by them.
Your leaders quickly accepted the proposi
tion. I suggested tenator White, James G.
Maguire and M. F. Tarpey as three. I went to
the other side, and, while they couldn't raise
any objection, they said they would see me
later. They haven't seen me yet. The only
kind of harmony they would have was, "You
step out and we'll step in."
We, with the people and the People's party,
will sweep on to a glorious victory in Novem
ber.
The Balfian Quartet sang, and thnn'Fleet
F. Strotner, candidate for Auditor, fol
lowed. He said much for the platform
and ticket and got in a whack at James D.
Pheian, the Rainey candidate, when he
said: "Our candidate, tne Hon. Joseph I.
Dimond, is not a millionaire, is not a
banker, is not an aristocrat and is not a
gold bug. He is a Bryan and silver Demo
crat."
Robert Ferral of the judicial ticket
turned himself loose for a few minute 3.
Portions of his speech are as follows:
Fellow-Democrats : I believe there is no law
against talking that way, even if we didn't get
on tbe ticket as Democrats, although it is an
hour or two since I rend the last Supreme
X-'ouri decision and I don't know what the law
really is. But, alter all, it doesn't make a fel
low a Democrat to call him oue or put his
name on the ticket. We are fighting each
other when we ought to be going into battle
shoulder to shoulder. I gave what influence f
could to the efforts of our next Mayor to secure
party harmony, bat when the time came I
said: "Here is where my duty calls me, sink
or swim, 1 wasn't born yesterday and I've
battled tor the Democratic party since before
many of you were born, yet I find to-day, after
all I've done, that I can't put my name on the
ticket as a Democrat.
We got the worst of a decision by one . vote,
didn't we 7 Well, so did Samuel J. lilden. So
did the income tux. But we'll battle on until
we get the best of it by thousands of votes.
There isn't a man on our ticket with a stain
on his name. Our platform rings with the old
truths of the Democratic party, snd it rings
with the name of Bryan. It declares for equal
rights to all and special privileges to none, and
it is in favor of religious liberty.
W. G. Burke, candidate for Superior
Judge, said that the ticket was nominated
by a convention of 450 citizens, above
whom rose no shadow of religions
bigotry. â¢ ;
Joseph Leggett, also of the judicial
ticket, made vigorous assertions that be
was with the , true Democratic party and
would stay with his friends. He d eclared
the charter, to be one of the most un
democratic documents ever presented to
the suffrages of a free people.
George I). Giliespie, candidate for Super
visor, vigorously described the party as
the anti-monopoly party and the one rep
resenting the people. . ....'" ,;,
T. Carl Spelling, candidate for City and
County Attorney, in the course of his
speech denounced the charter as an "ag
gregation of abominations," abunglesome
instrument, one presenting more depart
ures from the common law than the four
codes of California, and one that would
precipitate fifty years of litigation.
The quartet sang and the meeting ended.

SINGLE-BARRELED RATIFY
It Would Have Bien Awkward for
the Populists to Jo n.
The ratification was not a joint af
fair of the Buckleyitss and Populists, as
might have been expected from the suc
cess of Buckley's fusion. At a meeting of
the Buckley candidates the other night
it was proposed to make it a joint affair,
but all the candidates who had got left on
the Populist indorsement got up and
howled at the proposition. It really would
have been very awkward, as it was soon
realized.
Tom Egran, Senatorial candidate in the
Seventeenth, who lost the indorsement,
declared hotly that he would not be
canghtdead in the same hall with"my ma
lodorous opponent, Sam Braunhart," and
T. Carl Spelling, who was turnen down for
H. T. Creswell in the indorsement for
City and County Attorney, asked how it
would lootc for him to sit on tne stage in
side bis rival, "who happened to have the
money and the positions to buy an in
doisement from a Populist convention al*
though he is a gold bug."
There is a current story behind this hot
shot, whatever may be in the story.
Spelling, the Buckleyite candidate, was
certainly plated for the indorsement up to
evening. Ttie story which many are re
peating is that pome of Creswell 'b friends,
especially the Gallaghers, got in among
the delegates and accompanied their
solicitations for votes with a suspicion
that they might be appointed on the elec
tion boards by Mr. Creswell and so earn
$40 apiece. However this may be. Spell
ing's majority was turned into a minority
in short order, and the Rainey candidate
eot the indorsement
Ex-Supervisor P. F. Dundon has finally
and wholly bolted the Buckley camp, and
for the time is out in the cold as an inde
pendent citizen.

Pat Dolan's appearing to be over the poli
ticians are excited about the indorsement

that the last of the several hundred candi
â¢ dates has filed his application for indorse
' ment and stirred iis boots for a pull on
f thia important outfit.
The liquor Interest is organized for this
i campaign as it has never been organized
> before and it promises to cut a bigger
figure than it ever has before. Five allied
1 associations have created an executive
'. committee which will pick out a liquor
, men's ticket from among the candidates,
i Thirt executive committee is an important
political convention in effect and it is
! composed as follows:
Officersâ Chairman, J. P. Edoff; vice-chair
man, John Nobruan; treasurer, D. B. Faktor;
secretary, W. T. O'Brien; assistant, secretary,
C. Michener; attorney, G. W. Baker.
Delegates: California gtate Protective Asso
ciationâJ. P. Edoff, Joseph M. Lowe, John
Wolf.
German saloon-keepersâ John Hagler, Cap
tain Siebert, D. B. Faktor.
Retail Grocers' Associationâ John C. Nob
man, John Lacnman, J. H. Harje.
San Fraucisco Bruncn No. 2, C. 8. P. A.â J. B.
Gariand, T. M. Ferguson, \V. T. O'Brien.
Brewers' Protective Associationâ C. B. Stone,
F. T. Schuster, H. Wreden.
It is the plan to not announce the ticket
until a very few days before election.
Meantime the investigation of candidates
by special committees is going on.
"We estimate this vote to be worth 12,000
votes in San Francisco," said a prominent
| officer of the association yesterday. "There
\ are about 4600 licensed liquor-dealers in
i San Francisco. Each oue m these is cer
tainly worth another vote or two on
the average, by a conservative estimate.
The brewery interest represents 1700 votes
in addition. Then tnere is the wholesale
interest, with tbe many people concerned
in one way or another.
"Thia vote will stand together practically
solid. We are non-partisan and simply
care that our candidates are acceptable
I men from our own standpoint. We have
>no particular issues to urge. We are like
| Jeft Davis, all we want is to be let alone."
This is the political power before which
the candidates are tumbling over one
another to kow-tow to. It is generally
understood that Dimond will be the Candi
das for Mayor.
James D. Phelan has noted the wind 9
and on the eround of good taste has let
up in nis active advocacy of the new char
ter. He thinks it would not look well for
him to ask ior more power for the Mayor
when he is a candidate for tuat office.
TWO OF A KIND.
Buckleyites and Kellyltes Find
Themselves In the Same Box.
Followers of Buckley are about the
streets looking very sad at the prospects
of a hard wiuter and no possible chance
for a chance at the public treasury. When
tÂ»ie Buckley ticket was denied a place on
the official ballot by the Supreme Court it
killed the last hope of those politicians
for a chance to fatten on the plethoric
coffers of the City treasury ; consequently
the Buckley runners are sorry that they
had not the lore>ieht io ideutify them
selves with the Junta managers, who have
tbe only living show for success.
In the Republican party the Kelly-Ma
honeyites are in much the t-ame predica
ment. They feel a great deal like the man
who played pedro all summer and then
had to wear a linen duster all winter. The
saddest part of the whole thing was that
the adverse decision which blighted all
their expectation* was followed the next
day by a rain. As one of them disconso
lately remarked, "Double misfortunes
never come singly."
The "Swan," "Ideal," "Crown" and "Lead
er" are the best fountain pens in the world.
The stationery department of Sanborn, Vaildi
Co. are special Â»geuts in this City. Â«
C. L. Taylor Club Organized.
The C. L. Taylor Republican Club was
permanently organized in Scottish Hall
Friday evening, the following officers being
elected to hold during the present cam
paign: William Urquhart, chairman; W.
C. Cook, secretary ; John Reed, treasurer;
P. Fraser, Peier Miller, T. J. WeJsh, J. E.
McCormac, Georee Buzzini and A.
Cameron, vice-presidents. Angus Mc-
Cioud, A. Lauriston, R. S. Falconer, W.
J. O'Brien. A. Graham, George Davidson,
George D;ni;wald, J. A. Landlin and W.
R. Eaton, executive committee.
Death of MrÂ». E. T. Grosh.
Mrs. E. T. Grosh died Thursday morning, In
thia City, at the family residence, 3000 Cali
fornia street. The death was a sudden one,
although not entirely unexpected, as the de
ceased bad been ailing ior a number of years.
Mrs. Grosh was the widow of the late Samuel
Grosh and her quiet, unostentatious bene
volences were very many. She came here via
the isthmus in 1852, and made this City her
home continuously.
Peddlers Jubilant.
The Peddlers' Association met last evening
at Teutonia Hall, and was jubilant over the
success of its attorneys, Treadwell and
Sweeney, in having the law repealed that
forced peddlers to we.ir badge.'. Over 500 mem
bers attended and a motion was made to call
ail of the 1400 members together by next
Thursday evening to indorse certain candi
dates for election. Mr. O'Connor was elected
vice-presldetit.
Fell From HiÂ» Buggy.
Charles Vocke, a pork-packer, residing at
486 Eighth street, fell from nis buggy on Ful
ton and Pierce streets Friday evening in an epi
leptic fit and died a few hours later In the Re
ceiving Hospital. His skull was fractured.
A California Naval Cadet
For the first time in twelve years the candidate for admission to the United Btates
Naval Academy at Annapolis from the Second Congressional District of this State
has successfully passed the required physical and scholastic examination on the first
trial. Arthur Clark of Stockton, the son of Railroad Commissioner William R. Clark,
is the successful candidate. Arthur is a native son of the Golden West, born in
Stockton in 1879. He is a graduate of Hoitt's Military Academy, Burlingame, Ban
Mateo County. Physically he is a perfect specimen of manhood, while intellectually
he i 3 fully able to cope with the best product of the Eastern academies and colleges.
He is the youngest in a class of 160 applicants, only five of whom were successful.
Arthur will undoubtedly uphold the honor of his native Btate while at Annapolis,
and should necessity demand his services he will be found in the front rank, as he is
all heart, and will be a worthy follower of that grand old Admiral Farragut of whom
America is bo proud.
HOW JOHN MILLER
ROSE AND FELL
Strange Story of the Man
Who Shot Himself
on His Ranch.
He Embezzled a Million From
the Four Railway Magnates
Years Ago.
BUT ESCAPED SAN QUENTIN.
Kept Copies of Tell-Tale Books and
Was Able to Defy His
Employers.
When John Miller, the man who bilked
the big four out of a million dollars back
in the hey-days of the seventies, lay
down in the shadow of his vines and rig
tree 3 and put a pistol ball through his
brain he did tbe thing essential to prop
erly cap a most improper but Tery re
markable career.
To bilk Collis P. Hnntington and Stan
ford and Crocker and Mark Hopkins out
of $1,000,000 ought to be distinction, if not
honor, enough for one man. And so it
seemed to be for John Miller. For after
doing so, and even while they kept him
captive in one of the secret chambers of
their own bastile at Fourth and Townsend
streets, challenging them to do their
worst, and being at last released and told
to go free, and even to take with him a
large part of his plunder, he went
almost directly out of the whirl
of a brilliant career in the City
to the seclusion of a ranch in the Sacra
mento Valley and there remained, almost
forgotten, until the sounds of the pistol
shot by which he terminated his career
Thursday morning directed attention to
him again.
Miller came to this coast at the close of
the war. a young man under a cloud. He
was a Virginian and had served in tbe
Confederate army, brilliantly they said,
earning spurs and shoulder-straps,
but still having only escaped a
disgraceful death as the result
of a sentence of court - martial
throuzh the energetic efforts of influential
friends. That was told concerning him
as a fact, but lacking in detail it did not
weigh against him. Besides those were
days when private character was not
much inquired Into â people being too
deeply steeped in the fascinating diver
sion of becoming rich.
Sacramento was then the headquarters
of the railroad enterprise which was hold
ing the attention of the world. The pul
sations of the big business that had its
center there were felt through the whole
country.
In tbe throng of young men they at
tracted came John Miller, and he applied
for work at the office of the Contract and
Finance Company, building the Central
Pacific Railroad with the money of the
Government.
He was about 25 years of age, tall, slim,
of light complexion, quiet, aliuo-t reti
cent, in manner, eviuently well bred, but
having that in his blue eye that told of
force.
He was given a clerkship, and in a few
years bis salary had leaped to $15,000 per
annum. He had ideas about bow things
could be done better than they had been
uone before. Still, maintaining his modest
demeanor through the whole rarid course
of 11 is development, he stepped lightly up
from the desk of a $300 a month book
keeper to tbe rank of the most trusted
employes of the company. He becamÂ« an
oracle in its councils, and was given direct
ing charge of the whole business.
He came to San Francisco and built for
himself a magnificent residence on Nob
Hill â the residence which is now Frtd
Crocker's.
C. P. Huntin?ton had been making his
big fight at Washington against Tom
Scott of the Pennsylvania company and
bis Atlantic and Pacific subsidy scheme.
Mr. Scott's defeat cost Mr. Huntington
$1,700,000 so he said, but still he succeeded,
and in the flush of his triumph, or rather
in the weariness of his spirit as tbe result
oi his long battle, he came to San Fran
cisco.
Tuey entertained him well. He waa a
bigger man than he had ever been, and
others were eager to show him honor.
Stanford, Crocker, Hopkins, Colton â all
gave him and each other magnificent din
ners, and to them all John Miller was in
vited. Although not one of them, merely
an employe. Miller was treated fairly as
an equal, so valuable bad be proved him
self.
He now undertook In one stroke not
only to sbow his appreciation, but to
prove how well he deserved their consid
eration he would give them an illustra
tion of how a Southern gentleman of
means could play the host. His dinner
eclipsed the best efforts of all the others.
The president of the company, who had
come out here to rest from the labor of
spending over $1,500,000 in a single winter,
was dazzled by the splendor of the fur
nishings of Mr. Miller's home. While he
laughed at the table jests and responded
with evident gratification to the flattering
of the toasts, all the while he was thinking
mightily.
"How much does the secretary of the
Construction Company receive?" he asked
of Colton next day.
Colton named the neat sum of $15,000 a
year.
"But with that money I cannot under
stand how a man may buy such statuary,
build such a house and furnish it in such
style."
Colton suggested that there were ways
by which a man with ouch a salary might
supplement it. An inquiry was set on
foot, but it could not be discovered that
Mr. Miller had made any successful in-
TB-tments.
On the contrary, it was found that he
owned a number of very valuable pieces
of land, among them a few choice City
lots, a tract of ten acres of beautiful land
near Linda Vista, besides a ranch or two.
Then it was suggested that he be sent
away for a while. The affairs of an agent
of the company some distance away was
suggested as requiring attention, and
Miller was given the delicate task. No J
sooner was he out of town than J. 08.
Gunn, expert, was turned loose among
the books of the Construction Company.
Some friend advised Miller by wire and
he attempted to get out of reach. He was
captured, however, by the company's
detectives near Bakersneld, and secretly
brought back to this City, taken to Fourth
and Townsend streets, and through the
little secret stairway was led into the ex
tra private rooms on the second floor that
bad been reserved for the doing of things
about which the public must not know.
The key was turned and there they kept
Mr. Miller for six weeks, the impression
being allowed to get abroad that he had
escaped to Hawaii. Mr. Gunn went
on with his work and when be had
finished they told Miller what they had
found â that he was an embezzler in the |
sura of a million or thereabout. They
Wbre very severe with him at first, declar
ing a fixed purpose to send him to San
Quentiu for life.
To this Miller very coolly replied : "If
you send me I will carry you along. Do
you suppose I have been such a fool as not
,o have prepared myself for a possibility
of this kind? 1 have simply appropriated .
my share of some stealings. You have
been bigger thieves than 1 could ever hope
to be. \ou have plundered the Govern
ment, you have let contracts to yourselves
at outrageous figures, and you have de
stroyed the bocks and tbink there is no
evidence against you. But I was not such
a fool. I have copies of those books."
Mr. Colton, who was the diplomatist of
the company and with whom the busi
ness of gaining a confession and a trans
fer of the property from Miller was left,
reported this to the quartet, and they
were, of course, surprised and alarmed.
But they sent him back to threaten again
and express unbelief. But Miller simply
said : "I have copies of those books and
proofs of all your stealings. Send me to
San Quentin if you want to."
But they didn't want to. They wanted
now, first of all, to learn if it was true that
he had the books; if so, to gain possession
of them. Whin Colton asfced him where
the books were he answered that that was
his affair. He furnished them copies of
documents sufficient to prove to them that
he really did have them and from that
moment they dropped their threatening
attitude.
It got abroad that Miller was being keot
a prisoner in the big brick building and
such a bowl wan raised that he was re
leased and allowed to go home, but under
the surveillance of tbe company's detect
ives. And so this matter of a $1,000,000
defalcation blew over. Just what the
terms of settlement were has never been
made Known.
Miller gave up a large part of his hold
ings, but was permitted to still retain a
fortune. In exchange, it is understood
that be gave up the copies of the books
that be had. On tbe othor band there
was to be no prosecution. Both sides
kept to their agreement and a division
was made between tbe big four of what
had been turned over by Miller. His resi
dence went to Charles Crocker and the
ten acres at Linda Vista to Stanford.
Miller went down into tbe Sacramento
Valley, and, so far as San Francisco was
concerned, dropped out of sight There,
however, he b- came known as a progres
sive rancher and oillar of the church. He
was elected superintendent of a Sunday
school, and was highly esteemed by all
hands.
When the commission ol inquiry as to
the affairs of tbe Central Pacific came out
here in 1886 none of the railroa i mag
nates knew where Miller bad gone to.
This was unsatisfactory, however, and he
was finally allowed to be brought to the
City to testify.
Notwithstanding his connection with
the Sunday-school, he declared on the
stand that he knew nothing of all those
things, the knowing of which allowed him
subsequently to shoot himself to death
â¡pon his own ranch, instead of concluding
his liie in San Quentin.
Miller was married to a wealthy widow
of Sacramento, but in the midst of his
financial troubles a woman came here
from the East, claiming him as her bus
band and declariug that his name was
Woodruff Miller. That scandal was also
lived through, though Miller has since
been known as Woodruff Miller. His
death no doubt removes a thorn from the
pillow of the Southern Pacific.

matters have nothing at all to do with his
trip. "It is simply my annual vacation,"
said be yesterday. "I want a rest and
am going home. There is 'nothing new
under the sun,' they Bay, and that applies
to Hawaii. Things are dull there and
they tell me they are dull here, ergo
things are dull all over the world.
Hawaii is a great country to live in, but

long for home? If you want to put it
that way I was homesick and here I am."

of Honolulu and brother of D. G- Cani
arino, the ex-Grecian Consul, who is now

the British ship Gainsborough that wenton

towboat was alongside and there was a
great strain on the hawsers. The officers
on the Au- tralia seemed to think that the
vessel would be got of! and that as ail the
after holds were water tight the donkey
engine would be able to keep the forehoid
clear until the vessel was docked. Accord
ing to them the chances of getting tha
vessel off are good.
The State tug Governor Markham took

t c guests were Miss Gibson, Miss Lizzie
Rowland, Bert Chapman, A. W. Johnson,
Chief Root's wife and family, Mr. Scott's
wife and family and many others. All
the points of interest in the bay were vis
ited and a most enjoyable afternoon was
spent.
A dog chasing a diver was the principal
attraction at Meiggs wharf yesterday.
Tne animal seemed to be a cross between
a water spaniel and a collie and was a
splendid swimmer. He went alter tne
bird in a businesslike manner and chased
it right up against the pilot-boat Gracie
8. When the dog came to close quarters
the diver would peck at him, and when
pushed would dive. The dog would pad
dle around until it came up again and
than make a fresh start. Finally the
diver started oat to sea and the dog after
it. Then everybody yelled, "Save the
dog." J. Robinson and Tommy Crowley
got into a boat, and alter a hard pull
caught the dog and pulled him aboard.
He was too tired to right, but when the
beach was reached he jumped ashore,
barked his thanks to the boatmen and
then started up Powell street on the run.
The steam schooner Navarro arrived
from Clipperton Island yesterday with
300 tons of guano aboard. All the men
who were left there last year by the

another lot of laborers will take their
place. Those who came up on the Na
varro say they bad a dreary time of it,
but that it was not worse than they ex
pected. The Oceanic Phosphate Company
has not met with great success in working

up the largest cargo mined so far.
The little steamer Golden Gate got in
from Prince Williams Sound yesterday.
She was formerly a fishing steamer, but
was bought by the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company to be used as a tender for the
canneries. She did the work well. No
later news than what has already been re
ceived came down on her.
TRYING FENDERS.
Testa Made on the Electric Line on
Weit Mission Street
Yesterday.
Fourteen devices for preventing loss of
life by contact with electric-cars were
tried yesterday on West Mission street in
the presence of Superintendent Vining of
the Market-street system and a commutes
from the Board of Supervisors.
The tests were made in accordance with
a resolution of the board passed some time
ago requiring the electric-cars to be pro
vided with life-saving devices. All the
tests were unsatisfactory from the fact
that the cars, fourteen in number, were
run at such a high rate of speed that the
wood and iron dummy supposed to repre
sent a human being was strucK with suffi
cient force to have caused death had the
victim been of flesh and blood.
The inventors all declared against the
fairness of the tests, but the Supervisors
will look the matter over at a special
meeting and try to find a device that will
be less destructive than actual contact
with the cars.
Among those whose inventions received
a so-called test was John Craig, who re
sides on the southwest corner of Twenty
fourth and Chattanooga streets. He says
his fender was not given a fair "show," as
the railroad people would not permit him
to lower it to an elevation just above the
level of the track. Otherinventors register
the same kind of complaint.

As the result of an order received from
Washington yesterday there will prob
ably be a clash between the State and
Federal authorities over the matter of
quarantine regulations governing vessels
reaching this port from foreign countries.
The instructions referred to read as fol
lows :
Washington, D. C, Oct. 10, 1896.
Collector Jonn H. Wise : Hereafter nÂ« vessel
requiring quarantine certificate un ;er the
treasury regulations will be permitted to
enter the port of San Francisco without the
proper quarantine certificate of the National
Quarantine Officer. W. E. Curtis,
Acting Secretary.
Last July, when the position of Na
tional Quarantine Officer was established
at this port, it was thought that consid
erable friction would result. This was
averted, however, by Dr. Rosenau giving
way to Dr. Chalmers, the State officer, the
latter claiming supreme jurisdiction over
all vessels entering this port.
It is now believed in customs circles
Captain Hartman m Bloomers, and His Fantastically Decorated
Wheel
that the Government means to assume
control over all quarantine matters aris
ing at this port. Dr. Rosenau gave it out
yesterday that he would follow the in
structions to the letter, which means that
no vessel can enter at this port without
first submitting its papers to him. Unless
Dr. Chalmers is content to play "second
fiddle," so to speak, it is more than prob
able that the courts will De asked to de
cide which power is supreme â State or
Federal.

well decorated, but oddly rigged up as
well, ana represented a schooner under
full sail. Not a trim and jaunty yacht nor
a merchant coaster with a rough exterior
and an honest heart within. It was a low,

fair Castile, and the ingots of gold she
carried were the booty of the buccaneers.
That bike was indeed a pirate, and the
black flag at her masthead needed no
X ray to discern the skull and crossbones
thereon.
The lady who steered tne Captain Kidd
craft was dressed in the regulation bloomer
toes of the peaceful shore, but on her
breast she bore the skeleton insignia of
her vessel's dreadful calling. In and out
amung the wheels of a more peaceful pro
fession she cruised, first on the wind, then
braced sharp up, and again running free
before the wind with sheets slacked well
out, wing and wing.
When the other bikes saw the Red
Rover â that was her norn de marine â
bearing down upon them they wheeled
oat of the way, and escaped with their
crews unthrown and their tires unp'unc
tured.
It was well they did so, for that outfit
was piratical from machine to rider. She,
or he, rather, was Captain H. Hartman'
formerly in the Chilean naval service. He
was in charge of a torpedo station during
the last revolution in that country.
He also acted in the capacity of a spy
against the Government forces and a num
ber of times went through great perils in
disguise. Consequently, taeTa an adept as
an impersonator, especially in the part of
the female. In a spirit of adventure and
humor the Captain donned the bloomers
and aboard of his schooner-bike was a
lady and a graceful, though piratical, one.
Last evening Captain Hartman received
bis prize from the fair hands of Miss
(Trilby) Crane at the close of the perform
ance at the Columbia and the Red Rover
went out of commission.
The other twenty-nine prizes won at the
cyclists' parade for good roads were also
presented at the Columbia.

THE POLICE LAW
TO BE ATTACKED
Allegations That Commis
sioners Cannot Remove
Policemen.
The Fourteenth Amendment In-
yoked for the Wearers of
Stars.
THEY ASK FOR JURY TRIAL.
Questions Involved Will Be Brought
Before Both State and Federal
Tribunals.
Attorney Alfred Clarke is about ready to
file twenty-Ove damage suits against the
Police Commissioners, The complaints
are all by policemen who have been dis
charged during the past six years, and the
claim is that, pursuing the line of the
Gunst decision, the Police Commissioners
have no right to discharge policemen, then
business being limited to hiring them and
making regulations for their government.
"The cases will be brought in the State
courts and in the United States tribunals
simultaneously," said Attorney Clarke
yesterday, "so as to get the widest possi
ble range and opportunity for the men
who have been unfortunate enough to lose
their positions."
The material averments of the com
plaints are all alike, being based on the
constitution of the United States. After
alleging in each case that the discharged
policeman was a citizen, "pursuing the
calling, livelihood and occupation of a
police officer," the complaints continue as
follows:
That said John Doe had thus secured a use
ful, honorable and lucrative employment and
an assured means of livelihood (conditional on
good behavior) and a fair prospect of a pension
in iiis old age, all of which was of great value
to said John Doe, which livelihood and pen
sion were protected by his citizenship and the
said fourteenth article of the United States
constitution against arbitiary spoliation by
defendants herein named.
That his deportment in his said office was
uulformly good; and defendants, acting in the
name and under color of the authority of this
State, on the day of , 189â, wrongfully
and arbitrarily removed said John Doe from
his said office, in violation of said fourteenth
article of the United States constitution, with
out due process of law, under the authority of
Hill's case, 7 Cal., 102.
That said case has been relegated to oblivion
by the fourteenth article of the United States
constitution.
The claim of the plaintiffs is that the
only cases against the view held by them
were decided either before tne adoption of
the fourteenth amendment, as in the Hills
case, or that "the later decisions went off
on points without reference to the four
teenth amendment, the attention of the
court not having been called to the bear
ing of the amendment."
The section of the amendment relied on
says that "no State f hall deprive any per
son of life, liberty or property, without due
process of law." There are a number of
decisions that "a man's right to follow his
vocation is a part of his liberty," which
no man can deprive him of without trial
by jury, etc., which is a part of the "due
precess of law" meant by the amendment.
Policemen are much interested in the
case, for if the law is broken down there
can be no more star-chamber trials and no
more loss of situation without trials in the
courts. - _^_^^________
CORRIVEAU CASE ENDED.
Heirs of the Batate Accept 53500 for
Their Claims on the Storage
Company.
The Corriveau ca3e was settled yesterday
by the payment to the estate of $3500 by
Swanberg, Westphal, the Cold Storage
Company and others of the defendants in
the different suits brought by the attor
neys for the Corriveau heirs.
It was originally alleged that C. O. Swan
berg and H. W. Westphal swindled Corriv
eau out of $36,000. and a warrant for Swan
berg's arrest, charging him with forgery,
was issued. When the compromise was
effected the criminal charge was with
drawn, it being said that it was made
under a misapprehension and was not
founded on faot.
Reuben H. Lloyd, who represented the
defendants in the matter, effected the
compromise, which was signed in Judge
Coffey's court yesterday afternoon, J. D.
Sullivan representing Public Administra
tor Freese, L. M. hoefier the sole legatee,
Mme. Boutine, and A. Comte the absent
heirs.
Running Out the Chinese.
Statistics recently compiled by Deputy La

the factories where overalls are made, a line
which a few years ago was monopolized by
Chinese. White girls are now employed by
the Chinese bosses, and they have taken the

SOUND.MONEY DEMOCRATS
They Work for McKinley, as Well as
for Palmer and Buckner.
Since winning in the Supreme Court
the right to have the Palmer and Buckner
electors go on the ticket as"National Demo
crat" the sound-money Democratic organ
ization has turned more actively to its
campaign work, which is being mainly
confined to the distribution of sound
money literature, which the league has in
large "quantities. Under the direction of
Secretary Elliott McAllister 200,000 copies
of campaign documents will early this
week be sent to 25,000 addresses in San
Francisco. Poster portraits of Palmer and
Buckner are also being distributed. The
league has no definite anticipations about
what the Palmer and Buckner vote will
be. Its motive is wholly the defeat of
Bryan and Brvanism, and the leaders will
be pleased at a small vote if the true-blue
Democrats assist in Bryan's defeat by
voting for McKinley.

VOTING FOR POLICE CAPTAINS.
Father Crowley's Festival at Armory
Hall Is a Social and Finan
cial Success.
Armory Hall, on Market and Tenth
streets, was filled last evening, aad the
fair and festival thai Father Crowley has
carried on so successfully reaped a golden
harvest before the doors closed for the
night. The attendance was there for the
purpose of having a good time and to
make liberal contributions toward the
support of the Youths' Directory, for
which the fair was originated, and each
gratified his and her desire. The auc
tioneers put forth their best efforts to se
cure patronage, while the hundred pretty
eirls and women in the booths had but to
look to secure customers for their wares.
The occasion was known as St. Bren
dan's booth, night, and the following
ladies of the booth entertained : Mrs.
James Ryan, Mrs. T. J. Cusick, Mrs. P. J.
Ryan, Mrs. J. J. Donahue, Miss Siggins,
Miss M. T. Ryan, Mrs. J. Reidy, Miss M.
Callagban, Miss Maria Donahue, Mrs. H.
Boater.
The musical programme was an inter
esting feature. The festival orchestra
rendered operatic and popular selections.
Miss Eva Waithouse rendered two solos,
"Longing" and "Love's Sorrow," in a very
pathetic manner, and N. Ryan and Miss
S. Clereshaw gave selections on the violin
and mandolin. T. P. Crowley was the ac
companist.
The voting contest for the most popular
lieutenant of the League of the Cross
Cadets was a feature of the occasion. At
last accounts Lieutenant W. C. Hopper
was up clo?e to 300, closely followed by
Lieutenant N. Denvir. The young officer
receiving the highest number of votes will
receive a beautiful sword and belt.
Another contest no less interesting was
the vote for the most popular young lady
at the fair. The prize is a diamond ring.
There was a large field of favorites, but
Mios Mattie Bacome and Miss Georgiani
were well in the lead, although it is said
that friends of the others have docens of
votes that will be put in at the last mo
ment.
The contest for the most popular cap
tain of police, the prize for which is to be
a gold watch, still waxes hot. Last even
ing Captains Dunlevy and Spillane were
in tne lead, with over 3000 votes each.
The contest will close on "Wednesday
evening.
Monday evening will be known as Irish
night. One Irish night has been held,
and on that occasion Joseph Kelly and
John O'Connor were contestants in jig,
reel and hornpipe dances for a purse of
$100 offered by the Gaelic Society. The
judges then were unable to decide which
was the better dancer, and the two will do
their best to win the prize to-morrow even
ing. Bagpiper McCarthy and Fiddler Mc-
Mahon will be prominent characters of
the occasion.
Taken all in all the festival is a social
and financial success, and none is better
pleased than Father Crowley, the life and
spirit of the event.
MURPHY RANCH SALE.
Easton, Eldridge & Co. Hold a Success-
ful Sale in Santa Clara County.
The excursion conducted by Easton,
Eldridge & Co. yesterday to the Martin
Murphy Homestead, near Mountain View,
banta Clara County, was well attended,
and the sale was quite a success.
About 300 excursionists availed them
selves of the opportunity, and together
with the special train that arrived from
San Jose and residents from the surround
ing country there were in all about 1000
persons attended the auction. The
weather was all that could be wished for
to lend to the success of the sale.
From the point of the ranch where the
sale was held the eye reaches out over
thousands of broad acres of luxuriant or
chards aad vineyards. The orange with
its load of golden fruit, the olive with its
silvery sheen, the magnolia with its waxen
leaves, the cypress with its burden of ver
dure and the occasional sturdy oak, the in
tervals of waving grain, each a delight in
itself, and all adding their shades of color
under a cloudless sky, save, perchance, a
few white fleeces stealing away to hide in
some nook in the mountains that rise
majestically on either side.
Tne sale commenced promptly at 2
o'clock, the land offered comprising what
is known as Subdivision 3a of the Martin
Murphy Homestead, being a portion of
the seed and garden land lying below the
timber belt and fronting on the Mountain
View and Alviso roads.
Among the parcels disposed of were the
following: Lots 40 and 41, comprising in
all 19 acres, to B. F. Farreli, at $77 50 per
acre; lots 42 and 43, 21 acres, to H. S.
Madden for $]722; lots 45 and 46, 30 acres,
to M. O'Brien for $3300; lot 47, 10 acres, to
George S. Pendieton, at $82 an acre ; lot
48, 10 acres, to George Krieber, at $78 50
an acre; lots 49 and 50, 20 acres, to A. W.
Sanderson, at $93 an acre; lot 51, 10 acres,
to George Krieber, at $78 50 an acre; lot
52, 10 acres, to Arthur Schlett, at $80 an
acre; lots 53 and 54, 20 acres, to George
Thompkins, at $83 an acre; lots 56 and 57,
19 acres, to John Dailey, at $82 an acre;
lots 59 and 60, 21 acres, to A. L. Marsteen,
at $95 an acre.
Immediately after the sale of the garden
and seed lsnd the remaining parcels in
the Argues subdivision, comprising four
parcels fronting on the San Francisco and
San Jose romd, forty-two acres, were sold
at from $135 to $150 an acre.
The auctioneers expressed themselves
as satisfied with the results of the sale,
as the prices for the seed and garden
land in comparison were quite as good
as the previous sales of the preferred fruit
lands. The different parcels were sold
principally to farmers, who intend to
make use of the land for their own pur
poses. The few remaining unsold parcels
will be offered at private sale.
UNSUCCESSFUL TRIAL.
End of the Little Sloop That Was to
Go Around Cape Horn.
Last Sunday the little sloop Trial, which
her enterprising owner recently promised
would carry him around Cape Horn and
over two oceans blue, ended her career on
the beach at Point Diablo. The captain
â¢nd four companions went out on the bay
on that day and by unskillful seamanship
the Jittle sloop was run into the breakers.
The party landed safely on the beach, but
the frail'vessel was battered to pieces in
the breaker*. The would-be circumnavi
gator of the Horn is probably.now con
gratulating himself that he tested his sailor
aDilitiea before he got out of the harbor.
HELD FOR BURGLARY.
Patrick Kelly and W.lliam Corbett Now
in the County Jail.
The preliminary examination of Pat
rick Kelly, William Corbett, alias Martin,
and Ed Colvin, alias Gallagher, ex
convicts, on two charges of burglary, was
held before Judge Conlan yesterday.
They were accused of breaking into the
residence ot W. S. Duval, 1012 Pine street,
on the night of August 2. and the resi
dence of A. O. Holtrict, 1022 Washington
street, two nights later.
Part of the stolen property was recov
ered in a room in a house on Grant ave
nue, where Kelly and Corbett were ar
rested. The Judge held them to answer
before the Superior Court in $5000 bonds
on each charge, but reserved his decision in
regard to Colvin till to-morrow.
They are the three men who con
cocted a plan to escape from the City
Prison last Thursday afternoon during
the parade, but which was nipped in the
bud. Kelly and Corbett were taken to the
County Jail yesterday afternoon.
T. H. GOODMAN'S ILLNESS
The Passenger Agent Was Near
Death's Door Yester
day.
He Rallied Last Night and Physicians
Say That He May Get
Well.
Colonel T. H. Goodman, general passen
ger agent ot the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company, whose health has been on the
decline for some time, was taken seriously
ill three days ago. Late Friday night and
early yesterday morning the physicians
and the watchers by his bedside, in his
apartments at the St. Nicholas Hotel,
feared that he would not survive.
Colonel Goodman is attended by Drs.
Lane and Welch. Last evening they re
ported that the patient had rallied and
was slightly better. He is suffering from
stomach tronble and pains in the heart,
but is not unconscious. Only the physi
cians, two trained nurses and the patient's
life-iong friend, William Be Dell of the
Pennsylvania lines, are admitted to the
apartments of the sufferer. The doctors
reported to Mr. Be Dell last night that
they thought the crisis bad passed, and
that Mr. Goodman would recover.
Few railroad men in the West are better
known and none more highly regarded
than T. H. Goodman. He entered the
service of the Southern Pacific as a man of
practical railroad experience in 1868, and
has served continuously at the head of the
general passenger and ticket department
of the company ever since.
In Grand Army circles of California and
Nevada Colonel Goodman is widely
known. He was elected commander of
the Department of California, G. A. R., in
1888. He \% a member of George H.
Thomas post, and takes an active, interest
in all measures designed to promote the
welfare of veterans. Five years ago his
wife, to wnom he was tenderly
passed away.

VEIN OF SILVER
A Very Pretty Question of
Mining Rights Now
Being Heard.
This Is the Second Time the
Case Has Appeared in the
U. S. Court of Appeals.
OVER FIVE MILLIONS IN IT.
An Idaho Case Which Involves the
Matter of Side and Ebd
Lines.
The suit of the Tyler Mining Company
against the Last Chance Mining Company,
both of Shoshone County, Idaho, came up
for the second time in the United States
Court of Appeals yesterday on a motion
of the last named company for a new
trial. The action in question is one of
the most remarkable in the history of
mining litigation, in that it has twice
Map Showing the Claims of the Tyler, Republican and Last Chance
Mining Companies* The Dotted Lines Represent the Dis
puted Territory, the Tyler People Claiming That They Have
the Right to "Work to Any Depth Within the Northwesterly
End Line and the Southwesterly End Line Established in
1890. In a Prior Suit the Tyler Company Abandoned a
Portion of Its Claim to the Last Chance People.
been tried in the Circuit Court of Idaho,
twice decided in the Circuit Court of Ap
peals and on certiorari taken to the Su
preme Court, which tribunal sent it back
to the first court for rehearing.
The original suit involved the Idaho
Mining " Company, Republican Mining
Company and others, and was instituted
by the Tyler Company to enjoin the parties
named from working a vein of silver ore
having its apex in the Tyler mine, but
which found its way through the property
of those mentioned above. The principal
point involved is the right of one mining
corporation to follow a vein through its
side or end boundaries.
It appears that the vein upon which the
discovery was made in the Tyler claim
passed in at the northwesterly end line of
the Tyler claim, and running through for
a distance of about 1140 feet, passed out
through the southerly side line. About
August, 1860, the Tyler withdrew its
southeasterly end line back to the point
where tbe same would intersect the ledge
before leaving the Tyler ground.
The relative positions of the several
claims is seen by the map, wherein the
ledge is shown to pass through the Tyler
property into that of the Republican and
Last Chance claims. The tunnels and
works of the former also pass through the
latter. It is contended by the Tyler peo
ple that they have a right to work down
to any depth desired within the original
northwesterly end line and the southwest
erly end line established in 1890. These
end lines, in fact, really become the side
lines, and vice versa.
This contention has been twice upheld in
the Idaho courts, and once in the Court of
Appeals and is now before that body for
a second time. Suould a new hearing be
refused the case will be taken to the Su
preme Court for a ruling on the vexed
question of side and end lines and the
rights of a company to go beyond these.
The silver vein in dispute is estimated
to be worth probably $5,000,000, though
the amount directly involved reaches only
a few thousand. John R. McÃride of
Boise represents the Tyler Company.

ognition on the Ballot at the

PAY OF A SUPERVISOR.
The Supreme Court Gives an Interei
ing Opinion on It.
The Buprerae Court has decided that a
claim of $487 80 for mileage which was pre
sented by Supervisor Chapin of Madera
County is unlawful. The account was
allowed by the Board of Supervisors, but
the Auditor of the county, Willcox, re
fused to issue a warrant upon the county
treasury lor the amount. Then Super
visor Cliapin filed a petition in the Supe
rior Court for a writ of mandate. The
judgment was against him.
Justice Harrison, who wrote the opinion
of the Supreme Court, holds that the
Superior Court was right. "It would be
difficult," so reads the opinion, "to ex
press in more explicit language that the
entire amount which a Supervisor in this
class of counties shall receive in anyone
year for the services required of him by
law, <n by virtue of his office, is $400.
Traveling to and from his residence to the
county seat is as much a part of the ser
vices required of him as is tbe sitting in
the council chamber of the board, and the
compensation for these services has been
fixed by the Legislature in the foregoing
language."

TROTTING AT SANTA ROS A.
Entries for the Annual Fall Race Meet-
bg-'ome Details.
The Pacific Coast Trotting-horse Breed
ers Association will hold its annual fall
race meeting at Santa Rosa, commencing
on November 14 and continuing for one
week. The Santa Rosa track is one of the
fastest on the coast and the Santa Rosa
people are enthusiastic over the meeting,
having subscribed $1000 to have it held
there.
The track is situated near the center of
the town and has been kept in first-class
condition. There are 150 stalls at the dis
posal of visiting horsemen, and special
rates will be given by the railroad com
pany, so that the owners of horses now in
the southern part of the State will be en
abled to take part in the Santa Rosa meet
ing without costing them a very large sum
for transportation.
The Pacific Coast Trotting-horse Breed
ers' Association deserves the greatest suc
cess, for it is due to its efforts in a large
measure that the interest in light-harness
horses on this coast has been sustained.
In spite of the hard times this organiza
tion has distributed more than $72,000
among the harness horsemen in the past
two years â a big showing for an asso
ciation giving only two weeks' racing in
the year, and owners and trainers should
show their appreciation by entering their
horses liberally and endeavoring to make
the coming meeting a success. The en
tries close on October 24, whicn is the last
day of the Los Angeles races. The follow
inc is a list of the events to close on that
date:
2:40 class, trotting, purse $900; 2:30

A BLACKMAILER
Charles Montgomery, Phil
anthropist, Placed in
Wooden Stocks.
Inveigled Into a Lonely House.
Threatened With a Liv
ing Death.
BIG RANSOM AFTER RELEASE.
Strange Story Told After a Year by
a California Prison Commis
sioner.
Charles Montgomery, the well-known
philanthropist and boniface, has made
public a strange story, in which he de
clares that some fifteen months ago he
was blackmailed in the approved Win
throp style. Ho says that he was enticed
into a lonely house, locked in stocks,
tnreatened with a loaded pistol and being
burned alive, and, under duress, took an
oath of secrecy, was relieved and subse
quently paid something less than $10,000
for immunity.
The following is Mr. Montgomery's
story :
The story 1 tell you was known only to my
self and four other persons. I gave these
friends my promise not to divulge the secret.
I have myseil never repeated It, but by *oroe
unknown means the details of the affair
leaked out. About fifteen months ago a
strange man came to my office in the hotel
and informed me that he was about to invest
iv some property on a small street south of
Market street. He claimed to be a man unused
to transacting business, and he explained that
he had heard that I usually interested myself
in people whom I believed needed moral or
financial assistance.
1 had not much time to spare, but I set aside
my business and accompanied him to a small
cottage in the locality mentioned. On arriv
ing at the house I was somewhat surprised to
find that no sign "to let" or "'for sale" was on
the dwelling, and, furthermore, thejstranger
produced a latchkey with which he opened the
front door, which move was in itself somewhat
suspicious, but 1 am not a very suspicious per
son; I sei aside my hesitation and stepped
within the premises.
I found myself in a plain, unfurnished vesti
bule or hallway. Doors opened from it into
unfurnished compartments. I looked about
me, turned from my guide to investigate, and
on facing him again 1 was horrified to see that
he had drawn a murderous-looking revolver,
which he aimed at my head.
"Come with me," commanded the man. I
followed him into a back room and then saw
at a glance that I was in a chamber of horrors.
There, in one corner, stood the stocks, a table
of common pine boards in front of them, a
chair to the rear. A pile of old paper and
rags filled another corner.
"Take your seat in that chair," commanded
my tormentor. I thought of resistance, but
on second consideration I determined to face
the ordeal. I gave myself into the care of the
Almighty. Death had no terror tor me, but
the thought of my family and of the great
grief they would suffer caused me to make up
my mind not to tempt the man to do murder.
1 took my seat in the chair. The rude
stocks at my feet were lifted into place by the
maii. He commanded me to place my ankles
in the notches, and when I complied he closed
the upper section of the apparatus down, but
it did not close tightly. Placing his foot on
the thing he gave it a push down, and it
closed with a click, as if it worked with an
automatic spring. The pressure on ray ankles
was very painful, and alter my release my an
kles were core for a week.
Drawing the table closer to me the desperate
fellow produced several blank checks and pen
and ink and told me that he wanted me to
sign a cneck for $10,000, which he would cash
before he released me. 1 explained to him
that 1 had only a few hundred dollars in the
bank, and that owing to the new rules adopted
by the banking-houses no overdrafts would be
allowed. "You cannot get any mouey on the
paper," I declared.
The fellow seemed desperate. He asked me
if 1 noticed tnat lie had made all preparations
to take my life and afterward destroy my body
by placing it upon the pile of debris, saturat
ing it with oil and setting it on fire, as he had
thoroughly soaked the room with kerosene
and it would burn up completely before the
department would arrive.
1 insisted tnat the banks would not honor
the overdraft and that 1 could not raise any
money.
Then he told me that he was going to
shoot me, placed the revolver near my fore
head and teemed about to carry out his awiul
threat.
At this moment I muttered a prayer. My
whole soul was put into my appeal to the Su
preme Being, and as if paralyzed, that man's
arm dropped to his side and he exclaimed, "1
cannot kill you."
Tne fellow talked to me again, and I suc
ceeded in convincing him thai even if I signed
tne check he would oniy have to return again
to the house to tell me that he could not gee
the money. What followed this 1 am not at
liberty to tell, butaiter taking a binding oath
not to divulge the location of the house, the
description of my assailant nor the circum
stances of my confinement, the man released
me and I returned to the Brooklyn Hotel.
About two months later I paid the money. I
can say that the amonut paid wa9 not $10,000,
but I cannot say just how much it was.
Mr. Montgomery is a California Prison
Commissioner, and has labored much
among the convicts. He has always taught
the veracity of an oath. His character is
irreproachable, and his story is generally
believed. The only facts that are deemed
strange are bia non-resistance and his
failure to inform the police. These points
are somewhat accounted for by his belief
tn the necessity of keeping his oath under
duress. The location of the mysterious
house of detention remains undivulged,
but Mr. Montgomery says it was on a
small street south of Market and bounded
by Brannan, Second and Sixth streets.
CaDtain Lees said last night that the
story of the kidnaping was a surprise to
him and he wondered why Mr. Mont
gomery never told him anything about it,
if only in contidence.
"If "Mr. Montgomery," said the Cap
tain, "says the story is true, then I be
lieve it, as I would stake my existence on
anything he said. It might puzzle some
people to think that be would give up
the money instead of informing tbe police,
but, knowing him as I do. if he made an
oath as stated nothing in the world would
make him break it.
"I remember now that I observed Mr.
Montgomery at the Winthrop trial. He
did not bit among the audience, but sat
behind my chair, which was close to the
jury-box. It was the best position one
could take for getting a good look at the
prisoner. I suppose he was studying
Winthrop to see if he could identify him
as the man who kidnaped him.
"If it all happened in July, 1895, Win
throp cou.'d not have done it. Mrs. Mat
thews died on May 19 that year, and Win*,
throp was arrested for her murder on
May" 23. He was in close confinement
rntil the verdict of a jury set him free
on August 23. Howard Smith, his sup
posed confederate in that murder, com
mitted suicide on June 3.
"I am at a ioss to conceive who the per
petrator of the outrage could have been.
The matter has not been officially re
ported to me nor do I suppose It will be."

A banquet celebrating the wedding of
Miss Mary Pollock to William Donald and
the golden wedding of Mr. and Mrs. John
Donald, parents of the groom, was cele
brated last night at NativeJSons' Hall, onÂ»
Seventeenth street, near Valencia.
Two long banquet-tables stretched the
full length of the hall, and it was a bril
liant and handsomely dressed company
that occupied the seats. The menu was
very fine. The festivities concluded with
music and dancing, which did not cease
till the stars paled in tbe eastern sky.
The presents for the bride and groom,
Mr. and Mrs. William Donald, comprised
numerous beautiful and useful testi
monials, including complete bedroom and
kitchen suites, many silver table dishes
and fine parlor and stand lamps.
Among the golden-wedding presents
for the parents, who have been married
fifty years, was a good-sized nugget of
gold from John Smith of Idaho. A
singular feature was that all the principals
of the wedding celebration were oricinally
from Paisley, Scotland. The invited guests
were:

FERRIES THAT COMPETED.
One With an Original Fran chine Secures
a Supreme Court Decision.
Tbe Board of Supervisors of Del Norte
County in July, 1891, granted to Charles
Fortain and William T. Bailey a franchise
to establish and maintain a public toll
ferry on Klamatb River, which was estab
lished in 1891. Fortain was the sole owner
ol the ferry until January 1, 1895, having
purchased Bailey's interest. In August,
1895, Julius Smith etal. established a rival
ferry for the carriage of freight and pas
sengers within one mile of Fortain-'s ferry."
Fortain asked for and secured a temporary
in junction, which was afterward dissolved.
Then the case was appealed to the Su
preme Court. Yesterday the Supreme
Court reversed the order dissolving tbe
injunction. Fortain is sustained and hi*
rivals must desist. The court found that
"tne ownership of the franchise is the ulti
mate fact. In our opinion the plaintiff
can maintain the action without showing
sole ownership of tne franchise in him
self."
Lund Withdraws Hi* Suit.
Tbe case of E. T. J. Lund against John
Simpson, the Swedish Consul, to recover the
sum of $360 was dismissed in the United
States District Court yesterday. It appears
that Lund had a bill for the amount named
above against his sister* estate in Sweden,
which bill he placed in the hand* of Simpson
for collection. The Consul wrote to the proper
authorities in Sweden and was informed that
Lund's sister died thirty-tnree years ago, and,
consequently the claim had long since been
outlawed. Lund thereupon brought suit
against tbe Consul, alleging that if certain
Eapers had been filed in t me he, Lund, would
aye experienced no difficulty in collecting
the claim. The claimant's bill was for board
and lodging furnished his sister during her
early life. Judge Morrow ordered the case
stricken from the docket, the costs to be
equally divided.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1596.
GLOOMY OUTLOOK
FOR MR, ALFORD
Another Distressing Day of
Inactivity in Demo
cratic Ranks.
No Money to Carry On the Cam
paign for Bryan and
Free Silver.
A PARTY WITHOUT VITALITY
Brains and Financial Ability Driven
Ontâ The "Examiner" Asks
for Funds.
The Call's recent articles in regard to
the moribund condition of the Democratic
State campaign committee has had a good
effect on that organization, for yesterday
another clerk was hired, though as yet he
has nothing more to do than had his
hitherto lonely companion. The accession
of this scribe is evidently intended to be
merely an alleviation of the eohtude that
has for several weeks depressed all visitors
to the Democratic State headquarters in
the California Hotel.
Herbert Spencer, in a philosophic mood,
once remarked that zero multiplied by in
finity still gives nothing as the result, and
so two or even three Democratic clerks may
write as few letters as one previously did.
When there is nothing to do adding num
bers to the ranks of the unemployed can
not in any marked degree add life to the
situation. Such is the condition of affairs
at the Democratic State campaign head
quarters, and the Hon. W. H. Alford,
popularly known as '"the boy manager of
the boy orator's campaign," is still sitting
idly in the inner office, twiddling his
thumbs, wondering when a change is to
come and longing lor the close of tne tire
some campaign.
But a ray ot light has broken through
a rift in the clouds. The Examiner,
aroused from its lethargy by The Call's
impartial expose of the Democratic State
Committees impecunious condition, has
rushed to tne rescue with an offer to give
$2000 to assist Mr. Bryan's cause provided
other Democrats will eive a like amount.
Although this offer appears to have a
string on it, there is a prospect ot the Ex
aminer having to put up some money, be
cause some people will be willing to sub
scribe in older to stick the Examiner at
its own game.
Here is the opening paragraph of the
Examiner's manuesto:
: The, appeal of the Democratic State :
: Central Committee for funds where- :
: with to prosecute more vigorously :
: the campaign in California is nut :
: yielding returns with the needed rap- ;
: Idity, and the Examiner has there- :
: fore determined to lend its assistance :
: directly to the task in hand.
This statement exactly corroborates the
interesting articles published in The Call,
and if the Democratic campaign is to he
enlivened tbe thanks of Mr. Alford and
Mr. Bryan will oe due to The Call for
bringing about that result. Yet in this
matter, as a sturdy adherent of McKinley
and protection, The Call is glad to see
that Kind of work go on. This has been
trnly called a campaign of education, and
it must inevitably follow that the more
assiduously Bryanism is peddled out
among the people the fewer votes will be
cast for Bryan.
Ths Call has no objection to the effort
of tbe Examiner to swell tbe Democratic
committee's bank account, but when it
makes a statement like the following some
attention must be given to it. The Ex
aminer says:
While the condition of honorable poverty is
one of which the Democracy hag no reason to
be ashamed, the truths contained in the Chi
cago platform cannot be properly presented to
the country without the expenditure of more
or less mouey. Nothing is needed for corrup
tion, but something must be spent for educa
tion. Documents must be printed and dis
tributed, halls must be hired and postage mu-t
be paid. And as the capitalists will not settle
the bills the people must.
A great many genuine Democrats will
join in a protest against this view of the
situation. In campaigns of the past there
was never a scarcity of money in the
Democratic campaign fund. In fact it has
been tbe custom for the newspapers to go
to the Democratic State Committee for
large subsidies instead of having the news
papers raise money for the committee.
When Frank Gould was chairman of the
Democratic State Committee two years
atro he was a veritable bonanza for the
Democratic editors, and when a Demo
cratic newspaper owner left the Demo
cratic headquarters the gold in his pock
ets jingled till it could be beard for blocks
like the bell of a bicycle crossing the cob
bles of Market street.
That a change has come about is not the
fault of the leading Democrats of the
State. It is because the brains and finan
cial mainstays of the party have been
driven out of the party organization by
the Populistic, socialistic, anarchistic
platform on which Mr. Bryan hopes to
float into tbe White House.
Take such men as Samuel Q. Murphy of
the First National Bank, Bernard D.
Murpbv of San Jose, Charles Anderson of
Santa Barbara, L. B. Hakes and Cassius
Carter of San Diego, W. J. Hunsaker of Los
Angeles, ex-Mayor E. B. Pond, J. M. Mc-
Donald, Jeremiah Lynch, R. M. Tobin
and others cf like character, and imagine
an organization to which they owned alle
giance to be out of funds. The supposi
tion is ridiculous. They always kept tbe
till fall to repletion.
The Sound-money Democratic league
of California, which has headquarters in
the Mills building, ha* no difficulty in
commanding ail tbe funds required for an
active campaign. The reason for this is
that tliey represent the stalwart De
mocracy of California, who faced the ever
valiant Republican party in many a hard
fought battle. When such men as these
were driven from the Democratic party, it
was like drawing tbe intellect and vitality
from the human body. No wonder the
Examiner is moved to start a subscription
for the benefit of Mr. Bryan's Democratic
State campaign committee.
The catalogue of some of the veteran
Democrats throughout the State who have
deserted Mr. Bryan's banner as published
in yesterday's edition of The Call at
tracted much attention among Demo
cratic voters, and doubtless will yet others
to thinking with tbe result that the ranks
of McKinley's supporters will be largely
increased. When the rank and file see
that the men who have been recognized
as leaders are no longer with them they
will call a halt and in snch a case as this
reflection will produce a decision to sup
port a financial system that will preserve
the Nation's honor instead of following
the anarchistic vagaries of a man who is
intoxicated with the music of his own
voice.
The list of Democrats who have for
years been prominent in the councils of
their party, but who are now opposed to
Mr. Bryan could be extended at great
length, but the names already given will
serve to illustrate the point and open the
minds of the people to the true condition
of political affairs in California.
It cannot be too plainly stated that the
master minds of the old Democratic
party, the stamina of that organization,
have turned their bacss on Bryan and all
his works.
These men are now advocating the elec
tion of Palmer and Buckner or have
openly and boldly taken the more logical
position in favor of McKinley.
Now tor the lesson to be drawn from the
foregoing. It is brief and to the point.
It impresses itself with peculiar force on
the members of the Democratic party who
wish to preserve their party organization
as well as uphold the integrity of the Na
tion. These men who have left the organi
zation of which Mr. Alford is the figure
head see the danger ahead.
If Bryan should be elected his accession
would be hard times to the laboring peo
ple and disaster to capitalists and manu
facturers. Tnat is the national view of the
situation. Here in California Democrats
are disgusted to see the reins of power in
the hands of Populists, demagogues and
blatherskites. While they respect Mr.
Alford personally for his high character,
bis ability and all the qualities that go to
make a gentleman, they recognize that he
is impotent to make a move on the politi
cal chessboard without tbe assistance of
such men as Thomas V. Cator and others
of that ilk.
No wonder the veteran Democrats are
alert. If the enemies of sound money are
defeated next month the old guard will
be on deck, but if the Bryanistic fusion
should win and the arrangement should
be allowed to go ahead without a protest,
the Democratic organization would be
swallowed up by the Populistic boa con
strictor, leaving the real Democrats of the
State without a habitation or a name.

Should Buy Home Product*.
Secretary Mead of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association has written to the
boards of trustees of the Agnews and Napa
asylums for the insane calling attention to the
fact that California produces as fine salt, olive
oil, green corn, starch, matches, cotton and
woolen goods, etc, as any country or State in
the world. This was because th* trustees of
the asylum* have advertised for bias for their
annual supplies and have specified foreign
and Eastern brands of the products men
tioned. In his letter Mr. Mead says: "In view
or the fact that large quantities of these
articles are produced in tnU State we would
like very much to know lrom you why it is
that you do not or cannot buy the home prod
ucts?"

BRYAN IS TABOOED EAST
Letters From Illinois and Indiana
Show Great Gains for
McKinley.
Interesting Views of John W. Hunter,
a Prominent Nebraska Re*
pub'ican.
John W. Hunter, a prominent Nebraska
Republican, passed Ihrough the City yes
terday on his way to Arizona, where he is
interested in mines. Mr. Hunter has
lately made a careful study of the political
situation in Illinois and Indiana, follow
ing a nnique method, and his conclusions
are interesting. Speaking of his methods
and their results yesterday he said:
"I wrote to the clerks and other officers
of every county in the States of Illinois
ana Indiana and asked for a conservative
estimate on the percentage of changes
from the old parties, cautioning my cor
respondents to make no exaggerations.
"The result has been very encouraging
to McKinley. In all, I have received more
than 900 letters, and more than 80 per
cent of them show great gains for Mc-
Kinley in the towns and cities, slight
gains for Bryan in some Populist settle
ments, and an alarming exodus of gold
Democrats from the old camping grounds
of the Bourbons. It is almost hopeless for
the Democrats to expect anything in
Indiana. My letters show a bitter feeling
among the Populists, because the Indiana
Democrats would not fuse with them, con
tending for everything in sight. The
universal verdict is that business men and
thrifty citizens in workshop and field
hesitate to have anything to do with
Bryanism. If I can judge of the situation
at all by these letters, Bryan will go down
with Horace Greeley, as one of the worst
whipped men that ever entered tbe Presi
dential arena."
Hold Six Inquests.
Coroner Hawkins held six inquests Fri
day with the following results: Henry Smith,
accident; unknown man, accident ; C. Reed,
suicide; Annie Conroy, accident; Lee AhMee,
murder. In the case of Phillip Reiily, who
was killed on Bay and Powell streets last week
by W. H. Brittan, the jury held that Brittan
acted in seli-deiense.
SERVICE BOYS
FOR McKINLEY
Work of Union Veterans'
Patriotic League of Cali
fornia Division.
Rousing Words Recalling the
Efforts for the Country
by Republicans.
"BRAVE MEN WHO SACRIFICED"
Thousands of Campaign Circulars Dis
tributed Through the Mail to
Ccmades.
The McKinley Veteran Soldiers' and
Sailors' Republican Club, which has main
tained a permanent organization in this
City for the past five years, has united
with the Union Veterans' Patriotic League
for the purpose of working for the elec
tion of Major William McKinley to the
Presidency of the United States. It has
been in communication with the Union
Veterans' Patriotic League of New York
for some time past, and has been dele
gated by it to distribute campaign litera
ture throughout the State.
In conformity with these instructions
campaign documents issued by the Na
tional league have been distributed in
tnis State, ovftr 15,000 packaees having
been mailed from the Veterans' headquar
ters at 113 Turk street to all parts of Cali
fornia.
In each package are extracts from
speeches made by Major McKiniay to vis
iting delegations on the all important
issues of the campaign.
One paragraph iv toe circular speaks to
the heart and patriotism of the old vet
eran. It is as follows:
It is almost incredible that those who fought
to deliver this land from foes within during
the perilous hours of 1861-1865, should hesi
tate as to who would be most acceptable for
tue exaitea position of President In the pres
ent crisis of affairs; but that there are such,
goes without the saying, and these documents,
emanating as they do from the most distin
guished living defenders of our country's
honor, nre for their perusal, to the end that
they may enroll their names on the banner of
protection, progress and prosperity, touching
elbows with those who ore now endeavoring
to the Nation's honor by electing to the
Presidency tne patriot, pure "citizen and able
statesman, William McKinley.
The bitterness of the war belongs to the
past. Its glories are the common heritage of
usall. What was won iv that great conflict
belongs just as sacredly to those who lost as
to those who triumphed. We greet you to-day
not as soldiers, but as citizens interested in
maintaining the credit and honor of the coun
try you served so well and in restoring proÃ
purity and better times to our goodly heritage.
The future is the sacred trust of uÂ« all. South
as well as North. Honesty, like patriotism,
can neither be bounded by State nor sectional
ties. Financial dishonor is the threatened
danger now, and good men will obliterate old
lines of party in a united effort to uphold
American honor. This you have aiways done,
and you must strive to keep the Union worthy
oi the brave men who sacrificed and died
for it.
To assort and mail this promiscuous
mas* of literature to over 15,000 individu
als, whose names and addresses are kept
at the headquarters, nas required the
united labor of Colonel J. A. Whiteside,
president of the California association, arid
L. Washburn, the secretary, assisted by F.
Hanson and J, Steele, almost day and
night during the past fourtewrf days.
The expense for stamps was over $200
not to mention other incidentals, such as
printing and expressage.
The labor, as a matter of coarse, is one
of love and patriotism for the man and
the cause he represents.
With this notable assistance there can
not be much doubt how California will
vote on tne Presidential question.
CHANGES ON THE TAPIS,
Governor Budd Not Satisfied
With the Jute Mill
Product.
Changes Will No Doubt Be Inaugu
rated at the N zt Meeting of
the Prison Directors.
"Lately, as yon must know," said E. J.
de Pue. Prison Director, "the manufacture
of jute in this country has been puzzling
every man engaged in it. A few years ago
the conditions were different and the fac
tory at San Quentin was a profitable in
stitution. It has been anything but that
for a long time past. Governor Budd
visited the institution on the occasion of
the regular monthly meeting on Friday
last, and made an investigation of the
prison with special reference to the jute
mill. vVhat was said or done with refer
ence to making changes in the manage
ment was, of course, not meant for publi
cation.
"The Call" undertakes to tell the im
port of it in an article this morning, in
which it outlines certain changes in the
management that, we contemplated. Of
course, as any discussion of the matter
was not intended for the public, I cannot
speak of it further than to say that any
action tliat may be contemplated will not
be taken before the meeting in November.
"The jute mill has been a subject of
worry and inspection, at least to tbe
board of directors, since it was inaugurated.
It is true that the jute mill does not pay,
despite the appointment of a new super
intendent and a new force of spinners.
Of course an improvement is desirable.
But what action may be taken will only
develop at the meeting of the board in
November."
SAVED FROM SAN QUENTIN
William Rubles Confesses to a Crime
of Which Aggie Abbott Was
Committed.
A melodrama in low life was enacted in
Judge Bahrs' court yesterday. Aggie Ab
bott, who one day last week was convicted
of grand larceny in having robbed John
Ellis of a gold watch and some money,
was up for sentence. Her attorney moved
that she be granted a new trial and pro
duced an affidavit signed by William Ro
bles, an opium fiend now confined in tie
County Jail serving a sentence for va
grancy, in which Robles acknowledged
having committed the crime for which
the Abbott woman was about to be sen
tenced.
The affidavit says that the affiant makes
the sworn statement contained, therein
because of his love of justice and desire to
see no innocent person punished for hia
crime. The proprietor of the Barbary
Coast resort in which Ellis was robbed
also made an affidavit stating that Ellis
was in his place on the night of the occur
rence, but that be was with some woman
other than Aggie Abbott.
As three creditable witnesses swore that
the prisoner is the person who got Ellis'
goods bis Honor was in a quandary as to
what to dc. He finally took the matter
under advisement and ordered that the
makers of the two affidavits appear before
him on Wednesday next to make explana
tion.

A MERCANTILE MUDDLE.
Allegations of Conspiracy to Defraud
Blade by a New York Firm.
Joseph <fc Werner, a New York firm, yes
terday brought suit against L. & G. Breu
ner and D. S. Cohn of this City, Lesser
Bros, of New York et al., to obtain $8000
alleged to have been realized from the
sale of merchandise purchased by Lesser
Bros, of plaintiffs, but never paid for.
It is claimed that the goods were shipped
to L. & Q. Breuner to be disposed of, and
that they, failing in tbe attempt, turned
tuem over to D. S. Cohn, who sold them
at public auction, obtaining an advance
of $6500 on the consignment. After the
sale was completed, it is said that $1500
remained in the hands of the auctioneer,

the 5 allot.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 10.â The Pro
hibition party of Alameda County have
sued for an alternative writ of mandate to
compel County Clerk Jordan to file in his
office the certificate of nomination of the
Prohibition county convention and the
acceptance of the uuditing committee
named. Judge Ogden issued an order for
the County Clerk to appear October 13 and
show cause why the writ should not be
issued.
The affidavit sets forth in legal phrase
ology that the Prohibition nominations
were regularly made, that at the last elec
tion the party polled tne necessary 3 per
cent of the votes cast in the State and
county and that a certificate of nomina
tion was filed with the County Clerk. It
is alleged that the Clerk refnsed it without
designating any defect, writing or omission
why he should not accept it. On the next
day it was presented and refused and is
still refused by that official. On the sec
ond presentation of the certificate the
Clerk presented a written statement, giv
ing bis reasons for refusing the same. He
set forth that it was not properly attested,
that it did not state that the convention
was an organized assemolage of delegates
and that it did not give the auditing com
mittee as required by law.

f 100. To-day the time to redeem expired,
and a final deed was given. The lot is
worth from $500 to $600.

Parade on Captain

908 Broadway, Oct. 10. |
Captain Willard F. Fletcher of the
Police Department has become fired with
CAPTAIN WHLARD F. FLETCHER, Who Wants the Oakland
Police Force to Make as Good a Showing Against San
Francisco at Drill as at Shooting*
an ambition to instill into the local police
men some military ideas, and practice will
commence at once.
For a long time Captain Fletcher has
been trying to make a presentable appear
ance with the force when on parade, but
so far he has always been glad when it was
over and he was able to enjoy* the
seclusion of his office. He has now
reached the conclusion that only a course
of drills can produce the desired result,
and so the drills will begin at once.
All this extra work for the Police De
partment is the direct result of a visit
made by Captain Fletcher to the San
Francisco parade of policemen last Thurs
day. The Oakland man watched with
envy the display of gold braid and the
beautiful regularity of the evolutions and
brightness of the numerous buttons, and
decided that the Oakland bobby was a long
way from par. He returned to this side
of the bay, and he has been talking of
uniforms and counter marches and
"threes'" and "fours" ever since. The San
Francisco parade convinced the gallant
captain tha: if all the police forces in the
State could march in such stately columns
and fix their eyes rieht as quickly as Chief
Crowley's men do, Blanther and Dunham
would not now be enjoying their liberty.
No one knows better than Captain
Fletcher the magnitude of the task he
has undertaken. There are only fifty
men on the Oakland force and not more
than forty can ever % be available at one
time and eight rows of fives .can only
make a showing that will not compare
very favorably with Ban Francisco's 400.
"That sight last Thursday was a
grand one," said Captain Fletcher, "and
there is no reason why Oakland should
not make as good a showing in proportion
to our number. A police torce is a semi
military organization and the members
should at least understand the rudiments
cf ordinary drill."
"Captain Fletcher's ideas are quite
proper," said one of the force to-day, "but
we shall only look like a brigade of guys.
We are too shortbanded and have no time
to spare to go and drill. The efficiency of
â¢i police department is not displayed by a
dress parade anyhow nnd I would rather
land a good burgiar than stand still and
let the small boys admire me wliile the
sun shines on my buttons."
The drills will be conducted in the High
School grounds and very soon the percent
age of the force for dress parades will be
largely increased.

ARE AMBITIOUS
First Football Eleven Ever
Seen on the College
Grounds.
Manager Greeley Has Arranged
a Match With the Univer
sity of Nevada.
MANY GAMES SCHEDULED.
Greatly Encouraged by Their Success
in Their Match With Santa Rcsa
High School.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 10. J
St. Mary's College expects great things
from its football team and Manager J. J.
Greeley promises that they shall be forth
coming. Their success with the Santa
Rosa High School has greatly encouraged
them.
In speaking of the prospects of the team
Manager Greeley said: "The boys have
vastly improved since their last game,
when they easily defeated the Santa Rosa
boys, and much credit is due to Coach
Wyckoff, who is laboring daily to improve
their team work. At present about
eighteen men are endeavoring to make
the team, and from the outlook it will be
a stern contest. The team is not as heavy
as last year's eleven it is true, but never
a grittier or faster eleven has graced the
portals of St, Mary's than this year's
eleven.
"McGuire and Ferdinanz are the candi
dates for center, and both are quick and
cool men. Brady will hold down left
guard, and if ne continues to piay his
dashing game he will rank as one of the
best men on the coast. Butler and Mc-
Guire are trying for left guard and both
are putting up a snappy game.
"Cone and Haywards are fighting for
right tackle and are leading each other a
merry chase for the position. Hastings,
one of the best men on the team, and
Ferry are candidates for left tackle, and
both are first-class men. Mahoney and
Flood, both old-time men at the college,
will hold down left end, while either
Armijo or Huff will in ail probability be
selected for right end.
'-Behind the line the star material of
the team may be found. Captain Mogan,
the right half, is one of the best men that
has ever played in the college eleven,
and as a line backer he has no equal.
Rathgan. the left half, is a well-known
player. For quarter Welsh or Holmes
will be selecteu, and they are quick, cool
and valuable men. McCartney, the full
back, is a valuable addition to the team,
and as a punter aud line bucker he is a
top-notcher."
The schedule of games includes matches
against Santa Clara College, University of
Nevada, Vallejo and Stockton.
DEMANDS A NEW WHEEL
Pomeroy Sends a Formal C?aim
to the Southern Pacific
Company.
Attributes His Freedom From Per-
sonal Injury to B: ing a Foot*
ball-Player.
Oakland Office San Fbakcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 10. )
Edward B. Pomeroy of this city has
presented a claim to the Southern Pacific
Company for $100 or a new Spalding
bicycle. He says the company should
feel that it is getting off very cheap at that
and pay without delay. He says bis escape
from personal injury was due to his being
a football player and not easily affected.
Pomeroy was the only passenger on
the Hay wards local Tuesda. evening
when it met and was wrecked by a run
away freightcar of fruit from Hay wards.
The wheel being in the baggage-car was
badly demoralized and wrenched out of
all semblance to a wheel. Mr. Pomeroy
escaped with a few bruises, from which he
has fully recovered.
The runaway car was the result of a
train switching at the station. A car was
â¢kicked" in on the siding and the brake
man failed to "catch" it. The road is on
a grade and the car gathered momentum
as it continued on its run. The engineer
had orders to run ahead of time so as to
let the freight get out without delay and
was making the best time possible, when,
without any warning, he saw on the trsck
the car. The engineer and fireman
jumped and saved themselves, but the car
and engine were perfect wrecks. The
trainmen also escaped with bruises
although Conductor Gotbed was seriously
cut about the head by broken glass.
The freight engine came down the road
for the car and expected to find a number
of dead and wounded people, but was re
lieved to find that all had escaped. After
some delay the track was cleared and the
trains brought in.

PACIFIC-UNION CLUB
The Proposed New Home on Tan Ness
Avenue Will Involve an Outlay
of $325,000.
The active and progressive members of
the Pacific-Union Club are still full of the
moving spirit and earnestly in favor of a
club home on Van Ness avenue. Since
the general meeting last week the en
thusiasm has somewhat subsided, and on
reflection many of the members are con
vinced that $325,000 is a large sum of
money when it comes to actually raising
it. When it is simply discussed in mo
ments of enthusiasm it does not appear
prodigous, but talking of money is one
thing and making money talk another.
The proposition to move the club to
Van Ness avenue cannot be closed until
that sum of money or its equivalent in
bonds is actually in sight. The land on
the avenue formerly owned by the late
Fred Castle, but now owned by Colonel C.
F. Crocker, possesses many advantages for
a clubhouse. It is generally regarded as
the ideal site. At one time there was
great talk of building a magnificent tem
ple for the Masons on the land, and a Ma
sonic syndicate was organized and nego
tiations for the purchase were concluded.
When the time came for execution of
the deed the Castle people wanted an in
dividual rather than a society to become
responsible for the payment under the
terms of purchase, It was feared that the
society might change its bylaws, disincor
porate or do something else to cause liti
gation. Then Colonel Crocker, as the
representative of the temple syndicate,
stood in and became personally responsi
ble for the future payments. No one
stepped forward to deprive him of the
distinction of paying the whole amount of
money necessary to obtain the site and
hence he is now the owner.
The Pacific-Union Club's lease of the
building now occupied will expire next
April, but the club must signify on or be
fore October 30 whether it will surrender
the premises or extend the lease.
The committee having in charge the
bond subscription may report any day
that bonds to the amount of $325,000 have
actually been subscribed for.

DEFEATS THEIR PURPOSE.
Oakland's System of Taxing
Local Products Rcundiy
Denounced.
The L'gis'ature Will B; Asked to
Hep California to Protect
Itself.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Oct. 10. J
A movement is on foot to introduce a
bill in tne next Legislature to forbid any
municipality taxing the State products.
M. J. Keller, vice-president of the
Manufacturers' Association, is entirely in
favor of the measure. Said he:
"License regulation in California towns
is not in the interest of the State's natural
development. It seems there is a waste of
a good deal of valuable time and money
in the way of legislative and license para
phernalia in trying to find out how much
neighboring merchants and manufac
turer" can cinch encli other. As a matter
of fact tueir licenses are entirely inopera
tive, as against representatives of houses
or manufacturers outside of the State,
and even inoperative against representa
tives of California agents of outside con
cerns.
"The case, therefore, narrows itself down
to preventing the sale of California-made
goods to consumers. Is this wise in view
of the efforts being made to induce the
purchase and consumption of California
made goods? Is it wise in view of the
tendency of the times toward the abolish
ment of middlemen? Is it fair that the
Eastern competitor of a San Francisco
manufacturer is allowed to go scot-tree
from license, while the neighboring dealer
and manufacturer must be punished,
thwarted and run out of business because
of an absurd idea of State's rights which
permits California towns to impose such
antiquated barriers to the natural develop
ment of home products?
"Take, for instance, the towns on this
side of the bay. How much time, energy
and money "is expended in trying to tax
each other, and is not the impression left
on the consumer that the Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley merchants need pro
tection from San Francisco; that it is from
lack of ability to compete with the bigger
neighbor?
"I am in favor of a law being passed by
the next Legislature that will forever pre
vent any municipality from taxing the
State's products â at least, so lonu as the
National constitution prevents our State
from taxing or hampering the sale of
goods from another State."
CHARTER MASS-MEETING
The Mission Defense Union
Expresses Its Preference
by Resolutions.
The Proposed Fundamental Ltw of
San Francisco Spoken Of as a
"Pist" Destroyer.
The Mission Defense Union resolved it
self into a mass-meeting at Turner's Hall,
on Eighteenth street, last night to advo
cate the adoption of the new charter.
Judge F. W. Van Reynegom presided,
and in his openins remarks he showed
from a chart \?hich hung back of the
platform an approximate vote of the City
as cast at the last election: First ward,
1497; Second Ward, 3134; Third Ward,
640; Fourth Ward, 1302; Fifth Ward, 464;
Sixth Ward, 1725; Seventh Ward, 1595;
Eighth Ward, 5634; Ninth Ward, 3546;
Tenth Ward, 7028; Eleventh Ward,
18,631; Twelfth Ward, 15,852; which
gives to the Eleventh and Twelfth wards
34,483 out of a total of 61,548.
These figures were advanced to prove
the necessity of a more equal division of
not only the ward boundaries, but also the
representation in the management of the
municipal government.
Ont of the eighteen Assembly districts
in the City five are located in the Eleventh
Ward.
In conclusion he claimed that the new
charter will wipe out these ancient ward
lines.
vVilliam Metzner on being introduced
spoke at considerable length on the char
ter, and by the way of saving a good word
for his neigbbor.James Phelan, sandwiched
m bis fitness for the oiiice for which he
has been nominated.
H. N. Clement, one of the frsmers of
the proposed charter, pointed out its good
qualities by drawing attention to the bad
ones of the present consolidated laws that
now contain 110 amendments put there
by the Legislature from time to time.
He claimed that if the charter should be
adopted it wonld "forever destroy the boss
power and kill the political pests that now
infest the City Hall."
D. W. Thompson, Charles Wesley Reed,
Dr. J. A. Anderson, J. R. Freud, S. J.
Theisen and George D. Shad burn followed,
all of whom. made telling points in favor
of the adoption of the charter.
Judge F. W. Van Keynegora offered the
following series of resolutions, which were
unanimously carried:
Resolved, That we, tho residents of the
Eleventh Ward of San Francisco, assembled in
muss-meeting this 10th day of October, 1890,
for the purpose cf promoting the development
and prosperity of the C:Ay in which our homes
and business interests are centered, do hereby
indorse and ratify the proposed now charter
for San Francisco and pledge ourselves to vote
and work for its adoption at the coming elec
tion, on the 3d of next November.
Resolved, That we hail the proposed charter
as the only available means of releasing San
Francisco from the present weak, contused,
corrupt, inadequate and chaotic mass of laws
under which the citizens of this metropolis
are struggling for its government.
Also this one regarding the high school
site:
Resolved, That we, the citizens and taxpay
ers of the Mission district, urge upon the
Board of Education to take such immediate
action as will expedite the object fur which
we have so long labored; be It turther
Resolved, That we ask the Board of Educa
tion in selecting a site to in so far as possible
select one that will most fully satisfy the ma
jo â  ity ot our people as to location as weil as to
sanitation. We unhesitatingly condemn the
graveyard sites as in every sense unsatisfac
tory, and would recommend that the site be
located within the district bounded on the
north by Eighteenth street, on the west br
Dolores street, on the east by Mission street
and on the south by Twenty-sixth street.
Sued the Street Railroad.
George Hodgkiss and Catherine L. Hodgkisi,

BRIBERY CHARGES
STOP A CASE
Jurors Indignant at At
torney Sullivan's Accu
sations.
Charges in a Well â¢ Known
Damage Suit Against the
Southern Pacific.
ARRESTS WERE NOT MADE.
A Lawsuit Stopped Because Attor
neys Thought a Corporation Had
Bribed Jurors.
There was considerable excitement in
legal circles yesterday over the publica
tion of Attorney Matt Sullivan's state
ment, made in Judge Daingerfield's court
on Friday, to tbe effect that two jurors,
presumably John F. Sweeny and John
Heany, had been guilty of illegal conduct
in the damage suit of Anthony Quill
against the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company for $50,000 for the death of his
daughter. May, who was Killed by the
Berkeley local train at Dwight station last
February.
Before the jury was discharged by
Judge Damgerfield, Attorney Sullivan,
who represented the plaintiff, stated to
the court that at least two jurors in the
case were under evil influences, being un
der suspicion of having accepted bribes
from the defendant.
Jurymen Heany and Sweeny were
pointed at defiantly, and the attorney an
nounced that he had been watching them
closely and had had detectives on their
tracks. So positive was he in bis asser
tions that Attorney Ackerman, represent
ing the railway company, agreed with
the plaintiff's attorney that the case be
dismissed, and this was done, greatly
against the wishes of the Judge, who held
that the verdict ought to be filed and that
exceptions, if any, be taken thereupon.
Attorney Sullivan had his detectives
busy in the case all day yesterday, and he
said last night:
"We have found that Sweeny was fore
man in the Lombara Loan case against
Whelan, and we have iound a man named
Crawford mixed up in this case. Isaacs
and Crawford are the names of two men
we are watching and positive steps against
them and others may be begun at any
moment."
The accused men indignantly repel the
charges made and threaten to sue those
who made them for damages.
E. Isaacs, who was day before yesterday
tbe subject of the sensational charge of
tampering with the jury in the Quille
damage suit against the railroad com
pany, makes vigorous denial and threatens
a damage sun. He is joined in his
aenial by Juryman John F. Sweeny, who
says that he and Juryman Heany had in
fact voted for the plaintiff in the jury
room.
"The charge is absurdly false," says Mr.
Isaacs. I was in the company of Mr.
Sweeny every day during the progress of
the case, but that was natural and was
only because Mr. Sweeny and I have been
intimate personal friends and daily asso
ciate* for years.
"Mr. (sweeny was drawn on the jury in
Jud^e Daingerfield's court several months
ago, and up to about a week ago I was a
juror in Judge Tmutt's court. During
that time Mr. Sweeny and I aent to and
from the City Hall together every day as
friends, but we never conversed about the
jury-room. When my service was ended,
1 frequently went to the courtroom, where
my friend was serving, going out of curi
osity and as any boil j' might do under such
circumstances.
"It is an absurd mistake and the remarks
made by Attorney Matt I. Sullivan, as he
pointed me out in court, were an unjust
and cruel attack on my character and with
out the slightest foundation, except the
mistaken suspicions of the lawyer. I have
been well known here for thirty-five years,
and it is the first time my character was
ever attacked. I can refer to many of the
best merchants and other citizens of the
City as to my integrity, and I think my
character will compare favorably with that
of Matt Sallivan, or any other Sullivan. I
am no hireling of tbe railroad, Matt Sulli
van, or any corporation."
"I wish to deny all the charges made by
Sullivan as wholly false," said Mr.
Sweeny yesterday. "The best evidence
of this is the fact that Mr. Heaney and
myself, the ones he char.cd were being
tampered with, both voted in the jury
room for the plaintiff throughout, and if
it had not been for our stand tbe jury
would positively have given a verdict for
the railroad. In any event the damages
would not have been large, as many
thought they would be before they heard
the evidence. My verdict was given fairly
and impartially and in accordance with
the court's instructions to the jury. Mr.
Isaacs knew nothing of my mind in the
case, as we never conversed on it, and Mr.
Sullivan must realize now that he discov
ered a mare's nest. His outburst on Mr.
Heaney and myself was terrihe and
wholly unjustified."
FIGHT FOR A GIRL.
Mary I.enihan'a Parents Defeated by
Policemen Coleman and Mo-
Murray.
There was an exciting struggle outside
Judge Conlan's courtroom yesterday morn
ing for the possession of a girl, the con
testants being the parents of the girl and
Policemen Coleman and McMurray. The
girl assisted her parents as much as pos
sible, but the officers of the law triumphed.
The girl was Mary Leniban, 15 years of
age. She was arrested at an early hour of
the morning of October 2 by Sergeant Per
rin and Policemen O'Connor and Farrell.
Her younger sister was with her, but was
taken home. Mary used very vile lan
guage to tne arresting officers. The fol
lowing day she was taken before Judge
Conlan, and he committed her to the
Mazdalen Asylum.
Mary's parents consulted Attorney T. J.
Mogan, who wrote a letter to the Sisters
at the asylum that Mary was a nice girl
and had been sent to the asylum without
having a fair trial. The result was she
got a new trial and was taken before
Judge Conlan yesterday. The police in
troduced a letter which Mary had written
to her mother, asking her to see Bail iff
Kelly and others and get them to inter
cede with the Judge by telling him what a
good girl she was. The letter was inter-'
cepted by the Sisters. The Judge again
committed her, and it was while she was
leaving the court that her parents tried to
snatch her from the officers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1896.
STANFORD NOR
OLYMPIC SCORED
Their First Football Match
a Very Close Con
test.
College Team Shows Up Well
With Its New Men Against
Veterans.
OPINIONS OF BOTH CAPTAINS.
Fickert Satisfied, and Smith Says
"Stanford Has It on B rkeley"
at Present.
Neither side scored a point. That is the
way the Stanford- Olympic football game
resulted at Central Park yesterday after
noon.
The teams were about evenly matched.
What Olympic had gained in the recent
acquisition of several stars from different
Eastern gridirons was partially offset by
fumbling at critical moments. The show
ins; made by the Stanford men was an
agreeable surprise; it was the best gen
eral work that has ever been done by a
Palo Alto team at the opening of its foot
ball season. The college men did not
fumble, and fnmbling is one of the faults
of all teams eailyin the season. They
broke through well on attempted kicks
and the punting of their fullback was well
executed, and every kick advanced the
ball over thirty yards clear gain, notwith
standing the kicker stood cautiously from
ten to fifteen yards back of the rushline.
Btickney, the Harvard tackle, Olympic
coach and halfback, had charge of the
ball a great many times for his team, and
both in bis ready punts at close quarters
and in his line bucking proved himself a
valuable man. Percy Morse, the other
Olympic half, known as a speedy end
runner, got round the end twice under
interference for fair gains. Long runs,
however, were not a part of the game.
The gains by both sides were principally
through the line. There would be a quick
dash for an opening and a forward lunge
through the line. It was a style of p(ay,
except for the punting, not calculated to
fill the ordinary spectator with wild en
thusiasm. The teams were perhaps too
nearly matched all round to permit those
long dashes that set the spectator's pulse
tingling or make him miserable.
The Stanford players came on the field
first, and went through a little prelimi
nary lining up and passing of tne ball.
When, a few minutes later, the Olympics
appeared, the Stanford team looked small
by comparison, thoutrh the line-up does
not show a great difference in weight.
There were more spectators than at the
Reliance-Berkeley game the Saturday be
fore, and there was a little more demon
stration from the grand stand, for the col
lege contingent felt it had cause to yell
occasionally and to encourage individual
players.
The grand stand waÃ fairly well filled
and with a goodly number of the fair sex.
They were there bedecked mostly in the
red and white of the Olympics, though
the cardinal had a numerous following.
Just how the bail traversed the Held
and who advanced it when it was kicked
or carried is shown exactly in the accom
panying chart, the first play beginning at
the top and at the middle of the diagram,
which represents the gridiron field as
viewed from the main grand stand at the
west side of the grounds.
Only twice in the game did the ball pass
within the ten-yard line and then it was
sent there on kicks, one of which in the
first half went over the goal line and was
downed by Harrelson for a touchback,
after which the Olympics took it out to
the twenty-five yard line for a free kick.
The other time that it was close to goal on
a kick Soper received it behind the coal
line and kicked it far out of dangerous
territory for Stanford. Both halves ended
with the ball in possession of an Olympic
man about the middle of Olympic's terri
tory.
At the opening of the second half Stan
ford put in Rice in Cotton's place at ripht
tackle, and Dole in Searight's place at
left haif, and during the second half
Fisher retired from right half and was re
placed by B. Thomas. Stanford played
practically her best team as did Olympics.
Stanford's Captain's Opinion.
The Olympic ends saved the game for their
team. They did good work in helping to
pocket our tackles. The Olympic's tackles
proved the weakest spots in the line and
through them we made most of our gains.
The piayinK of Weldon and of Stickney for
Olympic was good, and Morse made some fair
runs.
Soder's punting was all right, but his catch
ing was not good. Fisher put up a fine game
at half. He was strong in both offensive and
defensive play. Jack Rice's work was good.
Harrington did well, except when the end
pocketed him. â 
Oa the whole the game was not so lively and
snappy as H might have been. The Stanford
line showed up pretty strong, but it did not
meet my expectations. Take it all In all,
however, I am not dissatisfied with the show
ing the boys made in their first regular game
this season. I think that our team is playing
better ball than the team did last year at this
time, particularly when It is considered how
many of them are new men. The early arrival
of the coach has something to do with it.
I consider the Olympics a stronger team
than the Reliance at the time we played Re
liance two weeks ago, Dut Reliance may have
improved since then. Chakles Fickert,
Captain Stanford team.
Olympic Captain's Views.
I am well satisfied with the Olympic team,
tut regret, of course, that we did not win the
game. We kept the ball In the Stanford ter
ritory a good deal of the time, and if it had
not been fumbled by our men I think we
would have won. Those two or three fumbles
lost us the ball just when we needed it most.
That man Â£earight kept laying for Stickney
all the time: he seemed to watch for him
alone. The result was, every time Stickney
would try to go round the end Searight would
be right there waiting for him. But Morse
made several good end runs.
The Stanford men could not catch those
spirals that Stickney punted ; it takes a mighty
good man to hold them. I think that we would
have done better if we hnd let Stickney do all
of the kicking. I think, too, that we should
have tried running our line men more.
I think that we can beat Reliance and I
think that ut the present time Stanford has it
on Berkeley and ought to buck right through
their line unless that team improves a good
deal. P. Smith, Captain Olympic Team.
' The players of the two teams as they
faced each other in the game is shown in

weight of each man is given to indicate

SACRED HEART FAIR.
The Undertaking Will Be Continued for
Another Week.
The well-merited success which has
crowned the efforts of the ladies of the
Sacred Heart parish since the opening of
their church fair has encouraged them in
the good work they have undertaken.
Armory Hall, corner of Page and Gough
streets, is nightly crowded by thousands
who come for the purpose of patronizing
the fair and getting the best bargains they
can for their expenditures. The display
MISS ROSE YOUNG.
of tbe many raluable articles in the vari
ous booths has encouraged many of the
patrons to repeat their visits, and it is
difficult to understand bow the ladies in
charge of the fair can afford to' give such
bargains. But bargains appear to be their
motto and the ladies say that as the arti
cles cost them nothing and were donated
by the charitably inclined they can well
afford to part with them for even less than
one quarter of what they cost and thus it
is that the "bargain secret" is explained.
There are many who could not con
veniently visit the fair last week, and who
sent word to the ladies that if they would
prolong the fair for Â« another week
they would surely visit them, and to ac
commodate these and| many others who
have not as yet visited the fair, bat who
will undoubtedly do so, the ladies have
concluded to keep the fair open every
evening this week.
Besides the many fancy and beautiful
articles being sacrificed, there is an excel
lent lunch prepared daily for the accommo
dation of those who may wish to get some
dainty morsels with which to appease
their appetites. Lunch is served from 11
a. m. to 2 p. m. daily, and there ia no charge
for admission during these hours.
There is aiso a daily paper published by
the young men of tbe parish, and to those
who may desire to advertise their business
an excellent opportunity is afforded. A
dollar or two spent in this manner will
pay a thousand fold.
The fair was in full blast last evening,
and judging from the crowds and the
general business-like appearance tne ladies
must have done remarkably well. The
contrast in the dress and costumes of the
many beautiful young ladies who last
night crowded the hall was as pretty a
sieht as one should care to look upon.
The management appears to be excel
lent, and there seems to be no complaint
as to the manner in which patrons are re
ceived and treated.
There is a literary and musical enter
tainment each evening, which adds much
to the popularity of the fair.
FROM FAR AWAY
PITCAIRN ISLAND
Miss Rose Young Arrives
From That Little
Colony.
Spent All Her Life There, but
Comes Here for Surgical
Treatment.
â¢MUTINEERS OF THE BOUNTY"
She Is the Author of the Above
, Work and Also of "The Story
of Pitcairn.' 1
Miss Rose Young of Pitcairn, author of
"The Story of Pitcairn" and "The Mu
tineers of the Bounty," arrived on the
steamer Australia from Honolulu yester
day. She left the island on the mission
ary schooner Pitcairn aiidÂ» from there went
to Tahiti. From the latter point she went
with the missionaries to Raratonga, Fiji,
Samoa and finally landed at Honolulu.
At the latter place she addressed the
members of the Young Men's Christian
Association on the manners and customs
of her island home.
Miss Young is an unconventional woman
of about 30 years. She speaks in a slow, de
liberate manner, and although there is a
peculiar accent her English is of the best.
She is not exactly good-looking, but when
her face lights up with a smile the irregu
larities are lost sight of. She is a new
woman, inasmuch as she does not wear
corsets, but nevertheless that does not de
tract from her upright bearing and fine
carriage. Miss Young is accompanied by
Miss Andrea of Ohio, who has been on a
visit to Pitcairn. Both went to Oakland
to the headquarters of the Seventh-day
Adventists, and Miss Andrea will remain
there until she starts for the East.
"I was very sick down at Pitcairn," said
Miss Young yesterday. "I did not like 10
leave my island home, but a surgeon was
required, so I made for Honolulu. There
they told me an operation was necessary,
so I came to San Francisco to have it per
formed. This is the second time I have
been away from the island. The first
time was when I was only 3 years old, and
then I was only absent a few months. On
my return I was reared among my own
people and remained there up to a few
months ago.
"How do we live down there? Oh, that
story has been told so many times. There
are 136 of us, men, women and children.
"We till the land and raise enough to support
ourselves and supply passing ships. Our
principal crops are sweet potatoes, corn, a
little wheat, Irish potatoes and all kinds
of vegetables. We have a handmill and a
windmill, and all our grinding is done by
either hand or wind power.
"No, it is not at all lonely. We have
our meetings, and then everybody knows
everybody. Then ships stop regularly at
our island home, and in that way we are
kept posted on the doings of the outside
world.
"The Seventh Day Adventist schooner
Pitcairn is doing good work in the southern
seas. Our church is growing steadily in
numbers and importance, and in conse
quence our missionaries are seeking new
fields. Many more groups of islands will
be visited this year, and in consequence it
will be late in December and probably
January, 1897, before the Pitcairn again
reaches Ban Francisco."
At this point Miss Young's friends
claimed her attention and insisted upon
her going with them to Oakland. If her
health will permit the author of "The
Story of Pitcairrr' will lecture here for the
benefit of the Seventh Day Adventists.
Cars Collide.
At 4:20 o'clock yesterday afternoon car 469
of the Powell-street line, going south, tried to
pass car 562 of the Ellis-street line, or the
Ellis street par tried to pass ahead of the
Powell-street car, and the result was a col
lision, the electric car 'Shoving the cable car off
the track. Fortunately there were no passen
gers on the dummy of the cable car at the
point of impact. The passengers on both cars,
however, were shaken up, but no one was
hurt.

"Now," said an earnest feminine voice
with an accent. The owner of the voice
cist a glance over her port shoulder,
moved along on the tnwart of the boat
aiuHships so as to shift ballast, then,
having her boat "trimmed," she bent her !
back and "gave way" with a vim. Some
boat lengths ahead was a boat which was
A- ceding along under the impulse im
parted to it by a pair of bending oars, the
handles of which were firmly grasped by
tiie shapely hands of alady well known in
San Francisco society. This boat was
leaving behind, in its wake, a train of bub
bles which danced in tbe sunshine. Under
its keel bubbled tbe water musically.
The wielder of the oars pulled "like a ma
jor," only she feathered her oars like an
old salt.
The ladies have a new fad. They are
learning to row on Stow Lake, at Golden
Gate Park. They have started gently
with small biceps and a wholesome fear of
callous places and blisters on their hands.
They have progressed in skill aquatic and
have developed their muscles. They know
"all aboard," "port" and "starboard"
and when to "feather high" and when to
'â¢feather low." Some 1 aye acquired a
nautical squint, which they use only when
they are boating on the lake, but then it
iÂ« very fetching. They can breathe easier,
row harder, stick to it longer, make their
boat go more steadily and faster, get less
blisters, pull more strokes without hitting
tneir rowing partners, make a straighter
wake without a rudder and run up along
side of the boat-landing more neatly than
they could when the summer opened.
Tne trick is catching. Ladies go to tbe
lake without knowiner a thing about a
boat. They step in gingerly, with suudry
small screams or ejaculations, and the
subject of their remarks is, in the main,
that they did not know that the boats
i would tip so easily. They take the oars,
away forward and poke their hands
iTWay down the bottom of the boat and
point the blaues of their oars well sky
ward. They splash the water, roll Che
boat, rub the skin off ihe inside of theii
soft, white fingers, "catch crabs" and
learnâ possibly because they see that their
friends have learnedâ to row a boat.
Handsome horses draw family carriages
up the somewhat steep slope to the height
upon which the Stow Lake boathouse
stands. The ladies bring their children,
sometimes the children's nurses, and, with
hampers filled with lunch, which they
spread later in the pine grove just west of
tbe boathouse, they have come prepared
to stay the better part of tje day. Tbey
pet afloat as soon as possible and very soon
are siiow.ng how they can row, with ever
growing satisfaction. When they become
tolerably proficient and meet a friend
who may be a social rival they may try a
little bout with the oars after the fashion
already described.
Not only tbe ladies are learning to row
and are making a fad of it. They are ri
valed in the fidelity with which they de
vote themselves to this branch of njuscle
developing athletics by at least a score of
Chinese women. Often the Chinese women
come to the lake without an escort. They
are there every day and co out rowing
every day. They do not ask any instruc
tion in rowing, such as Louis Obnimus,
the keeper of the boathouse, imparts to
the Caucasian ladies. Their idea appears
trjjbe to pet afloat and then laugh as much
a | possible. Whether they can row or are
totally ignorant concerning boats, they
laugh pretty constantly from the time
they first take the oars in band until their
sport is over.
Tbe habit has so grown upon while
ladies that it is absolutely safe to predict,
that they will appear on certain days,
whenever the weather is fair. Their faces
and the stroke that they pull have become
perfectly familiarto habitues of the boat
bouse. Amone them are some very
wealthy ladies who find this the pleasantest
form of diversion that they have been able
to discover. They do not wear navy-blue
blouses wit!i "cute" little anchors in the
corners of their naval cut collars like the
young ladies who affect yachting, but they
would be able to handle a dory neatly in a
fresh blow and fair sea with some men.
Sto*r Lake is ihe highest artificial lake
constructed for adornment and diversify
ing of park scenery in existence in the
United States, and probably the highest
of any simlatly created and similarly de
voted body of water in the world. That
is to say that it is unique and not alone in
this particular. The principal comparison
with park lakes in the United States roust
be with those of Central Park in New York
and Prospect Park in Brooklyn, N. Y.
But the lakes in these two great Eastern
cities, both being of artificial origin, are
not on the heights but are in the depths of
the pleasure ground. Consequently, while
they are pleasing features of Dark scenery
they are not scenic in the sense that from
their surface wide vistas are opened to
view.
But Stow Lake is raised hundreds of
feet above the sea level by pumping ma
chinery, and it was located on a high hill
simply that it might be the most wonder
ful artificial park late in the world. This
claim is modestly advanced for it without
fear of contradiction or dispute. A huge
ledge was blasted partly away to make a
basin for it and the remnants of this ledge
constitute a beetling island not far from
the northern end of the basin. Then
another island was made artificially, hav
ing upon it an artificial cascade of con
siderable size and much beauty. Then
came the big waterfall, which tumbles and
splashes into the lake from a height of
something like 100 feet, its source being
the reservoir supply which has been forced
up to that elevation.
Unon the artificial island semitropical
vegetation is growing rankly. Around the
sides of the big waterfall on Strawberry
Hill tbe huge fronds of ferns have thrived
beyond expectation. The artificially
made banks of the Jake are grassed and
on the inner edge of the sheet of water,
the Strawberry Kill edge, many plants,
flowering and otherwise, have been placed.
While it is impossible to accurately por
tray the progressive development of bi
ceps on the part of the lady wielders of
oars, it is fair to remark that the San
Franciscan is favored in this particular
over her sister in New York, for the Cen
tral Park boats are pulled by hired men
and the parfc boating trip has no advan
tage other tnan the enjoyment of com
paratively tame park areas which the
windings of the watery lane known as
the lake present to the passive passenger.
The New York girl gets no added muscle
this way. She might get a little, but
the great municipality of New York
treats her as if it were unsafe to let her
row.
But when the breezes from the Pacific,
blowing freshly in from over the gener
ous width of 6000 mile? of blue sea that
chafes alike the shores of Asia and of
America, sets all aflutter all the rihbonsof
the aquatic balle of Stow Lake it is a
picture worth going to the park to see.
She is lithe, erect and strong. Her hands
are sometimes encased in gloves when
the sun threatens to tan with the wind
their immaculate whiteness. She has on
her cheeks the glow of health and in her
eyes the reflection of thorough enjoyment.
Her eyes may be dark or may be blue, but
in either case they are as good mirrors for
the spirit of fun to show itself in as the
round world affords, "Cadiz not excepted.
Her dress is strictly up to date, fitting
superbly, and appropriate for the wearer
and for the occasion. It has strength and
elasticity. But no fabric is equal in elas
ticity to the flexible muscles which urge
the Stow Lake boat on in a friendly race
with another aquatic belle. The oars

flash as they run up to a speed of thirty
five to the minute, possibly. They drip
and dally with the smooth water as the
victorious belle waits for her vanquished
rival to come up. They furnish the best
music t ossible to accompany the laughter
and jollity of the lake party or family n'c
nic, as they strike the little white caps
with clock-iiKe regularity and precision.
There are some girls who can pull a regu
lar man-of-v;ar stroke.
Along a seemingly endless shore line,
which the belle sees as she urges on her
shallop, the breakers of the Pacific Ocean
boom and enamel the shelving sands
with snowy foam. She stops rowing and
looks off seaward, being raised far above
the ocean, and, while she smells the fresh
grass of the lake's turf margins and hears
the songs of the wild birds on Strawberry
Hill, she sees big ships with masses of
sails like huge snowdrifts piled up against
their trim masts. She is at once in a
land-locked lagoon and at sea with the
China and Australian liners. All of the
varied pageantry of the sea is hers to en
joy. Framed by the lake and the over
banging and sunny sky, with the deep
blue ocean for a background, she is a
pretty picture. At the same time it may
be remarked that there is no other park
lake in the world that commands such a
view.
The majority of the Chinese women who
splash with the oars and astonish the
many thousands of fishes in Stow Lake by
tneir queer aquatic antics go for the most
part dressed for business. They are all
bareheaded, of course. They wear a blue
upper garment and dark trousers, snowy
white stockings and Chinese shoes. Upon
their wrists are the inevitable green brace
lets of jnde stone. They hove some chil
dren along occasionally. The men who
attend them are few, and more often they
demonstrate their complete and entire
emancipation from social shackles by
coming and going without having any
tyrannical man to mar their pleasure or
to even hint at sexual inferiority.
But occasionally, while the Caucasian
belle holds her oars suspended, there ap
pears at the boat landing, from which all
lacustrinic voyagers depart in boats, a
vision like a human butterfly. In short,
this is a Chinese realization of the possi
bilities of color as lavishly applied to the
adornment of a belle of the almond-eyed
co-dwellers in the town; her hair, plas
tered and fixed in inflexible folds by the
application of pomades and oils, fairly
gorgeous with artificial flowers, such as
the gayest that ever grew in the gardens
of far Cathay. Her cheeks have layer
upon layer of fixed color upon them which
make up a total result in concentrated
hue like an Alpine glow on a fog bank.
Her clothes are so shiny and so vari
colored that they product* an effect which
may be summed up as iridescent
She knows that she is "stunning" in
her make-up and she does not care who
knows the one fact or the othar. It is
significant of the faith which she reposes
in her artificial complexion that she does
not row. Therefore her complexion does
not become streaked or striped by little
telltale rills of Mongolian perspiration.
The other women labor at tne oars while
she sits, like a petted child, in a rustling
mass of silks et ai., on a thwart and tries
the effect of her moon-shaped eyes on the
boatmenâ the coquetry of Canton and the
physical languor of the far East, coupled
with a catlike enjoyment of sunshine, ease
and being petted. If ever a human being
could be suspected of a desire to purr, this
would be the person.
The lake is not monopolized by the
ladies, but they are the more frequent
visitants. Professional men walk out
around the lake on the well-kept path
way every Bunday morning, with chests
thrown out, with flaunting boutonniere and
dispensing an aroma of choice tobacco as
they make the circuit. The favorite route
is out McAllister street and back by the
Park and Ocean road or over the park's
broad thoroughfares.
He Qatkers Skulls for a Lining
About five and forty miles below Port
land, on the Oregon side of the Columbia;
the broad expanse of water here flows
without a ripple, and is deep and as still
as death. The bans rises high above the
water's level, and stretches away back to
the timber line. Just above this point is
"CofÃn Rock," which was the starting
place to "the happy hunting ground" of
the various Oreeon tribes of Indians, but
the vary high water of 1862 swept Coffin
Rock of all of its deposits to the point op
low. It is a lonely place, without sound,
save the call of the cricket in the grass, or
the hoot of the screech owl nestled in the
adjacent timber. Here the overflowing
waters of nearly a half a ceniury ago
lodged the remains of many tribes, high
and dry, literally moving the last resting
place of their dead, for no Pacific Coast
tribe ever buried iheir dead below the sur
face of the earth. Some hedged them
about with rocks, above the ground, ieav
iug the face upward and exposed. Others
put a bark covering over them, while
others were suspended from limbs or left
in the forks of trees. Time has robbed every
form of its substance, and left only the
whitened bones and bleached skulls.
Students, dentists and physicians are
eager to secaie these trophies for articula
tion. So great is the demand that at
least one man has for years followed the
hazardous business of gathering these
skulls for the market It is risky, for the
few remaining Indians still keep vigil
over the remains of their dead, and to be
caught in the act would mean a prisoner
in the recesses of the neighboring moun
tains, followed by a death of slow torture,
for no quarter or morcy would be shown
the victim. Still, knowing this, Howard
Clause, a recluse, nightly risks his life to
gather these grinning, whitened skulls,
and every now and then a box of large
and small skulls are snipped from Port
land, Or., to the various noted seats of
medical and dental learning in the East.

Have you ever thought of tbe relation i
which may exist between what we are ac
customed to call "mere coincidences"? A
phrase like this explains nothing, but
simply notes that occurrences whicn seem
to have no connection with each other,
nevertheless come together in a way that
startles attention.
You are sitting in idle reverie and the
image of a friend comes vividly into your
mind, perhaps in connection with some
unknown event. Later you learn that at
the very time you were thinking of him
be did pass through that experience and
wished that you were with him. Or you
arise some morning with an inner convic
tion that a relative has died. He was
well when you last heard of him. There
is apparently no reason why you should
suppose he has passed from life, but you
believe it, notwithstanding these facts.
In a few days information comes that he
died on the nicht when your impression
was received. Are these cases "mere co
incidences?"
It has been observed that crime fre
quently becomes epidemic after the com
mission of some deed which excites gen
eral horror. Is this again only a coinci
dence? Wars, panics and pestilences are
said to recur generally. Are these "coin
cidences" too? A thousand illustrations
might be cited of concurring events and
commingled facts which are too striking to
escape observation, but whose significance
is evaded for lack of explanation by the
repetition of a phrase. Surely it is perti
nent to inquire if there imay not be some
reason why they coincide? We may
properly question too whether circum
stances arc ever due to chance.
The idea that anything happens seems
oddly out of place in a world confessedly
governed by laws. From the smoothing
of a pebble to the evolution of mind order
prevails in natural processes. The connec
tion between cause and effect is always
maintained. Each kingdom claims its
own and puts forth no unrelated thing.
Law governs tbe formation of a elobe
from fire-mist, evolving its various ele
ments by orderly means that permit no
chance results, no causeless changes.
The millions of existing creatures are
under its sway. Law makes the rain to
fall and the mist to mount upward. It
causes fire to consume and light to speed
forth into space. Even the shifting wind
obeys tbe pathway it has traced. Where,
then, does the element of chance enter
into nature's domain?
We may be told that while law cer
tainly does control the phenomena of this
material world, it has nothing to do with
such concerns as have been suggested.
Such a reply, although clearly an as
sumption, is perhaps justified by the
present state of scientific attainment. The
laws of matter have been carefully in
vestigated, but the realm of causes imma
terial has escaped observation. No laws
have been discovered therein; conse
quently it is assumed that none exist.
But the widespread interest in mental
phenomena which has been developed
during tbe past decade or two has grad
ually led up to a different view. The in
visible is no longer the non-exisfent. The
tangible is not the only real. So many
unsuspected, or at least discredited,
powers of mind have been disclosed that a
solution is now readily given to problems
which had long remained inscrutable mys
teries. In some cases scientific experi
ment has proven the reality of these
powers, as that of suggestion, so amply
demonstrated in hypnotic practice. Other
cases have been as well verified by private
investigation, leaving no room for doubt
in the minds of candid explorers that
mental powers include a capacity to act
beyond the confines of tbe brain. A whole
series of marvelous possibilities has been
disclosed. Little as is yet known of
them it is already clear that these powers
are not fugitive, but act accordine to law.
That thought is readily transferred from
mind to mind without extraneous aid few
will ionger deny. Cases of thought trans
ference are too frequent to be dismissed aa
imaginary, or to admit the supposition
that they are "mere coincidences." The
only adequate explanation is that thought
does travel through the invisible ether
which surrounds us. If we consider that
thought is a mental act, and like all other
acts involves the use of a certain degree
of force, or energy, it will be easy to un
derstand that it sets up a definite vibra
tion in etheric substance. This vibration
reaches another brain which receives it as
an impression of the thought sent forth.
It is, in fact, a kind of mental telegraphy.
In tbe days when it was supposed that a
telegraphic message could only travel
over a continuous wire, it was the fashion
to scout such an explanation as savoring
too much of the "supernatural." Now
that messages are actually sent from wire
to wire across intervening spaces this ob
jection has been swept away, for although
wires cannot yet be dispensed with, it is
enough lor the justification of our theory
to show that vibration is communicated to
the ether.
Here, then, we have a natural explanaÂ«
tion of those mysterious coincidences in
thought which have been used as illustra
tions. Your friend, by thinking intently
of you in connection with his experience,
brought it and himself before your mental
sight. It was not supernatural. It was
not even strange when you know why it
occurred, but was quite as much a matter
of course as is the delivery of a telegram
That was once impossible, too, but as the
worlJ rolls on it brings now and then new
things and new forces into activity. The
present is pre-eminently a period of such,
unfoldment. as is shown by its remark
able discoveries and its even more remark
able inventions. Is it not, then, more in
keeping with the spirit of our age to seek
an explanation of mysteries than to brush
them aside as mere results of chance,
Similarly we may believe that a convic
tion which arose wholly from within, and.
which was subsequently verified, must
have been the result of thought transfer
ence. It was received in sleep because in
that state the brain is far more receptive
to impressions than when busied with
making thoughts. For this reason, al
though our minds catch frequent impres
sions during the day, those which come
to us in sleep are usually more vivid and
lasting.
Accepting this view of thought trans
mission we are able to understand how a
criminal idea may be spread. Not only
does the criminal set up his own vibration
in etheric space, but every mind which
dwells upon his crime sends out a sug
gestion of the deed. Many minds make
{he thought intense. Can we, then, who
have learned something of the power of
suggestion, marvel that ready actors take
up the thought, repeating that evil deed?
Investigators are only on the threshold
of unseen realms in this age, and hardly
peer across the borders. What they have
learned, however, has already discredited
the idea that nature is limited to the
sphere of our sense perceptions. What
lies beyond tfelongs to nature, too, and is
evidently subject to natural law. Roent
gen's discovery of the X ray discloses,
moreover, the fact that our conceptions of
even visible nature were not correct, and
tnat the invisible bears much closer rela
tion to it than was supposed. We may
therefore assume that in future scientific
study will include investigation into these
realms of mystery in which we are en
folded. Then perhaps we may discover
tbe causes of other coincidences, and learn
why the cycles recur. We may find that
law governs earthquakes as fully as
eclipses, and that not even a disaster
comes by chance, but, like a comet in the
orderly constellations of the heavens,
bears its relation to orderly events.

k California Artist in Holland and Belgium and a XVI Century Aubrey Beardsley
F ANTWERP it has been said that the desire and
love of wealth is the luling passion. An old monk
once wrote that Brussels could boast of noble men,
Antwerp of money, Bruges could show the prettiest
girls. Louvain was justly proud of her learned men,
and the poor town of Ghent could only produce
the halters which marked the humiliations to which
her turbulent citizens were so frequently subjected,
the lordship of Malines was chiefly remark
able for the fools which inhabited it. 1 beliere the reputation for unusual
simplicity dated from the story that the citizens of Malines once at
tempted to extinguish the moon shining through their cathedral tower,
mistaking the radiance for a fire.
Every town in Holland or Belgium is within a few hours of every
other town; therefore the resolve to visit Antwerp or Bruges needs no
more deliberation than a sudden irresistible impulse to visit East Oakland
or Petaluma, only there is this difference. In California the mighty

resolve to travel need not be communicated to all the neighbors, nor does
it awaken in their minds any overwhelming anguish of interest. To leave
a town in Holland in order to cross the border into Belgium is a grave
matter; to leave a little village for the same purpose is to become a public
character.
A little ramshackle carriage, with flapping tarpaulin blinds, stops
before the door. It is called the "rideout." The postman, Jan de
Ziouw, knocks on the door and opens it, shouting in Dutch that it is time
to leave. This is the signal for the gathering of the cians, and the de
parture is accomplished only after innumerable handshakes and nods of
the head and repeated good wishes for a safe journey. The children fol

A Phantom Dog and a Majors Son
Translated from the Russian. i
During the war of the Caucasus I was j
serving in one of the regiments sent i
azainst the mountaineers. At that time a |
young officer from the Imperial (iuard j
Nedewitchef was transferred to our regi- I
ment. He was remarkably handsome,
witn the figure of a Hercules, and would I
have become a general favorite were it not
for his shyness and extraordinary misan
thropy. Sulky and unsocial in disposi
tion, his only affection seemed centered
on an enormous black dog with a white i
star upon its forehead, called Caro.
Once our regiment had to move aaainst
a Circassian village that was in revolt.
The Circassians defended their position
with desperate bravery, but through supe
rior numbers we disposed of them easily.
The soldiers, driven to frenzy by the stub
born resistance of the enemy, killed every
one they met. Nedewitchef commanded a j
company ano was in front of every- j
body. Near a mud hut I met him face to i
face, and I was thunderstruck. His j
magnificent face was all distorted by an
expression of brutal cruelty; his eyes
were bloodshot and wandering like those
of a maniac in a fit of fury. He was liter
ally chopping an old man to pieces with
his sword. I was shocked at such a dis
play of useless ferocity and hurried for
ward to stop him. But before I had j
reached him the door of the hut flew'open i
and a woman, with a cry which made my
blood run cold, rushed out of it and flung
herself upon the corpse of the old man.
At this sight Nedewitchef sprang back
ward as if he had been shot himself and
trembled violently. I looked at the woman
and couid hardly suppress a cry of sur
prise. Heavens, what a gorgeous beauty I
was the/el With her iovely face, pale as !
death itself, uplifted toward U3, her mag
nificent blacK eyes full of nameless terror
and mortal hatred were phosphorescent,
flaming like two burning coals as she
fixed them upon us. Nedewitchef stared
at her like one fascinated and it was with
â¢n effort that coming out of his stupor
he gave the orders to beat the rappel in
order to put a stop to useless bloodshed.
I did not see Nedewitchef a;;ain for sev
eral days, and only learned accidentally
from his orderly that the same young
woman, two days later, had come to his
tent, thrown herself at his feet, and pour-
Ing her whole soul into her tale had con
fessed 8n ardent iove for him. She de
clared that, according to the Circassian
custom, his courage bad made her his
slave and that she wanted to be his wife.
Remembering well her look of hatred 1
did not at first believe, but had to yield at
last to the evidence.
After the submission of the village we
encamped there a considerable length of
time. One afternoon, calling my dog, I
took a gun and went out for a stroll in the
wild vineyards. I had no intention to
hunt, but simply to take a walk and watch
the spienuid sunset from the top of All-
Dag. Having gone two or three miles by
a narrow path which wou,nd up to the
mountain top I entered a small thicket,
drowned with sunlight and burning like a
jewel set with gold, rabies and diamonds.
Under a group of tali trees, lying lazily
on a patch of green moss, I saw Nedewit
chef; the black-eyed beauty was sitting
near him playing with his hair, and asleep
at the foot of his master was the faithful
dog. Unwilling to break their tete-a-tete,
I passed unperceived by them and began
climbing higher up. While crossing a
thick vineyard I suddenly came upon
three Circassians who, perceiving me,
rapidly disappeared, though not quickly
enough to prevent my seeing that they
were armed to the teeth. Supposing them
to be runaways from the conquered village
1 passed on without paying them much
attention. Charmed by the pleasant
evening I wandered about till night and
returned home very late and tired out.
Passing through the camp toward my
tent I at once perceived that something
unusual had happened. Armed horsemen
rapidly brushed by me. The division ad
jutant was galloping furiously in my
direction.
Curious to knew what had happened I
went straight to the crowd. I had hardly
approached it when 1 saw it was Nede
witc'ief'stent, and a horrid presentiment,
which soon became a fearful reality, got
hold of me at once. The first object I saw
wasama^sof hacked and bleeding flesh
lying on the iron bedstead. It was
Nedewitchef. He had been literally
chopped to pieces witn yatagans and dag
gers. At the foot or the bed Caro, also
bleeding, was stretched, locking at nis
master's remains with such a human ex
pression of pity, despair and aflsction
mingled that it brought a gush of hot
tears to roy eyes.
Then it was that' I learned the follow
ing: Soon after sunset Caro, furiously
barking, ran into the camp. It was im
mediately noticed that his muzzle was
bleeding. The intelligent dog, getting
hold of the soldiers' coats, seemed to in
vite them to follow him, which was imme
diately understood, and a party was sent
with him up the mountain. Caro ran be
fore the men, showing them the way, till
at last he brought them to a group of trees
where they found Nedewitchef's mangled
body. A pool of blood was found at quite
a distance from the murdered man, for
which no one could acconnt, till pieces of
coarse clothing disclosed the fact that
Caro had had his battle also with one of
the murderers and had coma out best in
the fight; the latter accounting also for
his bleeding muzzle. The black beauty
had disappearedâ she was revenged.
Several of the officers tried to keep Caro,
but he would live with none. He had got
very much attached to the soldiers, who
all doted on him. Several months later
the poor animal was killed in bis turn by
a mounted Circassian, who blew bia brains
out and disappeared. The soldiers buried
the dog, and many there were among them
who shed tears, but no one laughed at their
emotion.
Eighteen years rolled away; war was
declared with Turkey, and I, as an old
Caucasian officer, well acquainted with the
seat of war, was ordered off to Armenia.
The Turks were in a minority, ano, evi
dently feeling afraid, they remained idle.
We also had to be inactive, and quietly
awaiting developments encamped at Kizil-
Tapa, in front of the Aladgin Heights, on
which the Turks had entrenched them
selves. Camp discipline was not very rig
orous at first, but after the unfortunate
battle of Kizil-Tapa, which we loet, the
most trifling breach in regulations was
often punished with death.
After awhile I heard people talking of
the mysterious apparition of a dog named
Caro, who was adored by the old soldiers.
Once when I went to see our colonel on
business I heard an officer mentioning
Caro, wh^en Major T., addressing an artil
leryman, remarked:
"It must be some trick of the soldiers.''
"What does all this mean ?" I asked the
major, extremely interested.
"is it possible that you should not have
heard the foolish story told about a dog
Caro?" he asked me, full of surprise. And
upon receiving my assurance that I had
not, he explained as follows:

points the way. Napoleon laid it out and it is quite as suggestive of his
taste for magnificence and pomp as the great tomb under the golden dome
of the invalides in Paris. It is a road for a king to drive through in a
royal chariot. The little rideout, however, bumps along behind an
ancient horse with admirable cheerfulness. In the center of the avenue
the thick tree trunks rise like the pillars of a Gothic cathedral and the
overarching branches meet high above the head; the sunlight is subdued
like the light through siained-glass windows, and at either end of the van
ishing aisle a faint blue mist rises like incense.
Between the trees, as within a frame, you see constantly changing
pictures of Dutch peasant life, ia the fresh, keen, early morning air. The
women are already bending over their work in the fields or washing at the
edge of their garden in the little silver streams. The lields roll away to
the distance, an emerald sea, and away in the horizon is the inevitable
veil of mist.

The streets run up and down and around the corner and back again,
witn a piquant irregularity, and are crowded with women in quaint caps
and little dogcarts piled high with vegetables and children.
Upon leaving the town the train crosses an immense arm of the sea,
which was formed centuries ago by an inundation, 10 which the Johns
town disaster was nothing. The arduously conquered soil was divided
into a hundred islands. Towns and villages were swept away and the los 3
of life was horrible. It is called the "reed forest." From Dordrecht to
Antwerp is a distance to be traversed in less than two hours, but the
difference in the character of the two countries is hardly less than may be
found between the extreme East and the extreme West of the United
States.

one knew whence, ran toward any care

legs to awaken him. Of course, as soon as
the man was fairly warned he, would begin

of perfect innocence. The soldiers began
circulating the most stupid stories about
that dog. They affirm that it is no living
dog, but the phantom of Caro. a New

of their regiment, who was treacherously
killed by some Circassians many years
ago, during the last Circassian war with

No more avenues, forced to march with the precision of regiments of
soldiers, sometimes allowed to grow only on two sides, the great branches

eternal straight lines an insolent little pine forest of young trees straggles
away from the train. They stand in ragged groups, their heads together,
like whispering children, or they run after each other in twos and threes
or stand alone, su'king end silent.
The houses in the little villages are painted white, aad are gay
with vegetable gardens. The sky is a candid blue, and a few astonished
clouds that have most apparently lost their way are traveling back as fast
as they may to Holland.
The train flies through the pleasant country, that is like pleasant
countries all the world over, a little like France, even a little like Cal

painted with water. Only one portrait stands the comparis on. It is that
of Simon de Vos, painted by himself. The figure of the painter stands
against a dull green background, in velvet of brownish black, one long,
fine hand holding a roll of paper, the while of the frill around the necK
and wrists of a rich subdued tone, and the face, that under a shower of
black hair, looks straight out of the canvas, wears an expression of such
smiling mockery that is almost like a personal affront. The eyes follow
the observer with intolerable superciliousness, an insolent gayety, at
once patronizing and contemptuous. And the maddening ease with which
it is painted does not lessen the astonishment of the simplicity of the sur.

Perhaps we will aiscover something."
All readily assented. Not wishing to part
from good company, and being besides
devoured with curiosity, I said I would go.
We passed through a lonely gorge and
began mounting a steep incline. We'now
I distinctly saw the chain of sentries on the
! picket line. We kept to the bush in the
| shadow to escape observation, and. in
fact, we approached unobserved. Pres
ently it became plainly evident that a
' sentinel seated upon a knoll was asleep.
We had come within a hundred paces of
I him, when suddenly, from behind a bush,
darted a huge black dog with a white
star on its forehead. Ob, horror! It was
the Caro of Nedewitchef. I positively
recognized it. The dog rushed up 10 the
sleeping sentry and tugged at his leg.
I was following the scene with intense
concentration of attention and a shudder
ing heart when at my very ear there canie
the crack of a pistol shot. I started at the
unexpected explosion. Major T. had tired
attheaog. At the same instant the cul
prit soldier dropped to the ground.
We all sprang toward him. The major
was the first to alight from his horse; but
he had hardly begun to lift the body when
a heartrending shriei burst from his lips
and he fell senseless upon the corpse.
The truth became instantly known â a
father had killed his own son. The boy
had just jained the regiment as a volun
teer and had been sent out on picket duty.
Owing to a terrible mischance he had met
his death by the hand of his own father.

Encounters With Forest Monsters
A striking looking man, wearing a heavy
dark beard and with dark eyes, arrived
here a week or two ago on the steamer
China and took up his quarters at the Oc
cidental. He was attired in a dark blue
suit, while on his head was a white soft
hat. These, combined with his neglige
shirt, careless tie and other features of
garb, betokened possible experiences in
the wilds. It was soon revealed that this
was true. Packed away in his rooms were
several puns, seme skins of wild animals,
several hunting suits and other parapher
nalia used in forays in the mountains and
jungles.
The man was Lieutenant Joseph Polo of
Pans, a noted mm rod and traveler, who
has, like his famous namesake, Marco
Polo, been exploring remote portions of
the world. While abroad he has partici
pated in many hunting expeditions. He
has gone in quest of the biggest game to
be found in the Orient. He visited many
different sections, his trip extending
through different countries for over a year.
He had much good fortune on his hunting
trip, and is congratulating himself on the
enjoyment he has had.
While abroad he has visited India, Bur
mah, Java, Cocbin-China, Cambodia and
Tonquin. In some of these countries he
spent considerable time, but was longer in
Cochin-China and Cambodia and Ton
quin than any other countries. He as
cended the famous Red River in Tonquin
has lived in poverty, but introduces himself to every one with a blessing \
upon them, down to the last dayâ a blessing which this particular ob
server accepts with some resentment.
A Quintin Massy* leads us to the time-worn conclusion that there is
nothing new under the Bun. He is a sixteenth century Aubrey Beardsley.
The daughter of Herodias is a part of an altar-piece. She is in a dress of
heavy brocade, with a rich pattern; her pale little head, with red hair and
redder flower?, under a transparent veil, is finely and firmly drawn against
a flat, dark background, in which a whole scene takes place, as in a
tapestry. The curious position, the strange expression of the face, that is
almost alive with an animation that is far more wonder than horror, con
vinces us that the sixteenth century draughtsman is still the superior of
his modern imitator, who might with advantage imitate not only lha
quaintness and the archaic simplicity of his ancestor out a little of the
beauty and a great deal of the reserve of these old pictures.
One of the oldest buildings in Antwerp and by far the most interesting

middle of the seventeenth century they printed only mass and prayer
books.
Something of the charm and interest which is attached to Nuremberg,
to Bruges, to Verona and to all old cities is re-enlivened before we leave
Antwerp, in spite of its well-swept modern streets and boulevard with
trees and residences of conventional stateliness. There are old streets and
old buildings; the prison of the riotous, gay and devil-may-care tavern
painter Jan Steen; the funny little old church at the port: the port
itself. If the vessels of every nation do not fill the wide bay formed by
the Scheldt, as in the days when Antwerp rivaled Venice for its wealth
and prosperity, at least the scene is one of great animation.
After Antwerp Mechlin, or Malines, seems dreary and dead. Empty
streets, empty squares, around the churches crowds of ragged children,
who strike out rudely if you refuse them alms. The children are every
where, they swing on iron chains in the great empty marketplace, where
a meager fair, a sale of decrepit furniture and ragged clothes and broken
pottery attracts a few curious spectators. Van Dyck Beown.
and had some interesting experiences
amon? the natives.
In Cochin - China he spent several
months. His time there was devoted to
hunting for the peculiar deer indigenous
to that country. He also visited the for
ests and hunted for the extraordinarily
beautiful leopards that abound there. In
Cambodia he also hunted for this game
and for many other varieties. Cambodia,
be says, is a magnificent game country. It
abounds in big game of nearly all Kinds,
and is, according to Lieutenant Polo,
the paradise of sportsmen. In Tonqum,
where he met many friends from France,
he also hunted for leopards, as well as
tigers. It was with the tigers he had his
most exciting experiences. The lieuten
ant told about these yesterday.
"I suppose it falls to tUe lot of few
hunters," he said, "to have the rare sea
son of enjoyment which I have for over a
year past experienced. In nearly ail the
countries I have visitedâ at least where
I remained any length of timeâ l
went on hunting forays. But it was in
Cochin- China, Cambodia and Tonquin
that I enjoyed myself the. mo3t. There
the wild game abounds in profusion.
"Cambodia, which is a very beautiful
country, with flowing rivers and pic
turesque scenery, is a great country for
tigers; they are very big and powerful,
though I cannot say their sKins are al
ways the best. But when it comes to size,
strength and agility they beat any tigers
that I have ever seen.
"In company with several friends of
miue we went after these tigers. We were
:ii-med mainly with fine express rifles.
There were some other guns used that
were supposed not to possess any particu
lar merit. They were all, however, useful
in these experiences; for they were
thrilling, and required not only great
vigilance at times, but a promptness of
action only necessary in a wilderness
where vicious animals abound.
"To get these wild animals in Cambodia
we organized a large party, being made
up of a number of the most experienced
tiger-hunters, and we had with us Â» re
tinue of natives who beat gongs and rang
bells and made all kinds of queer noises
la order to drive the tigers from their lair.
We invaded the forests, we did not seek
for the tigers in the open, for in Cambodia
they are most numerous in the thick
woods.
"When we had selected what we consid
ered a rendezvous of the wild beasts, we
surrounded it with the native gong-beaters
and ball-ringers. We had previously taken
the precaution to erect a high scaffold, or
platform, and on this we, who proposed to
shoot the tigers, took up our position. If
it were at night, we had blazing fires to
light the forests.
"We were very successful in our endeav
ors and before we had got through we suc
ceeded in killing no less than seven tigers.
Besides these we killed a large number of
leopards. When the natives on the out
skirts raised their cries and sounded their
bells and gongs, the animals whatever they
were fled toward us, and then all we bad
to do was to exert our utmost skill in
bringing them down, Borne of the ani
mals, especially the tigers, were very
fierce, and had we thrown ourselves need
lessly before them we would have had
some personal encounters that might have
resulted in death.
"As it was, nothing of this kind hap
pened, but I may say that it is certainly a
very vivid experience that one has, espe
cially if it be at night, when among
the soughing of the branches and per
haps amid the occasional falling of rain
you hear at first the weird sounds of the
bells and gongs, the far-away shouts of
the natives, and then presently see the
dark forms and glistenihe eyes of the for
est monsters bounding toward you. It is
a time of feverish excitement and a time
for being cool as well, for without being
cool it is not to be expected that you cajjjf
make a center shot. When you have sh6t
you are pretty apt to know whether the
wound you have made has been so savage
as to cause fatality. The shrieks of these
animals, combined with their rage, add a
weird and fearful grandeur to the darkness
of the forest.
â¢"This kind of experience I had over
and over again. It is something to be re
membered, and somehow a man thinks
more of himself from having gone through
these experiences, but what I have told
you is only a part of the experience of the
tiger-hunter and leopard-killer in a coun
try like Cambodia. When daylight ap
pears, if you have been firing by aid of
the sidelights of acampfire, you are en
abled to pursue your game that has been
wounded and fled for some distance away.
This is done of course by following the
trails of blood, and when you follow these
trails, especially if you are proceeding
through a thicket, you must be very alert.
"Your gun must be in a position to be
immediately used, for there is no animal
that is more apt to be revengeful at such a
time than these powerful animals of the
cat kind that probably for hours have
suffered from ugly gunshot wounds. If
they are not seriously weakened they will
fight, and they will fight with an alacrity
and vigor that are simply astonishing to a
man who has not had experiences with
them. It is like a battle with a grizzly to
come in contact with them. The wounded
animals seem to make a more desperate
fight than those who have not been
wounded at all. They are endowed with
phenomenal strength, and their remarka
ble quickness make them frightful com
batants at short ranee.
"The only way to do, at the instant you
catch sight of your wounded animal and.
can see that he has any life remaining in
him, is to pour lorth a volley of lead. If
you don't do so. or if by chance you are so
nervous as to miss your animal, he will fly
to the fore and make it so interesting for
you that you may never again participate
in a tiger hunt.
"LucKily for us we succeeded in killing
all the wounded tigers as well as the
leopards that we came upon. Their skins
we took and preserved, and they will ever
remain so long as they last with us as me
mentos of our experiences in the Cambo
dian woods.
"But 1 have omitted to speak of some
other kinds of pa me in whose quest we
enjoyed ourselves also very much; the
spice of danger, it is true, was gone in
some instances, but skill was required
nevertheless. 1 refer for one thing to the
peculiar little brown d*er indigenous to the
hills of fair Cambodia. All deer you
know differ a little in different countries,
and a man who will pick up a textbook on
zoology will soon ascertain that in North
America there are a great many different
species of deer. The noble buck which
Daniel Boone killed in the Kentucky for
est is different from the deer that is to be
found in the Sierra Nevadas. Lik ewise
again, these are different from the deer in
Southern Mexico and Central America.
The Cambodia deer, with their Daautiful
brown color, sometimes shading to a dap
ple, and with their magnificent antlers,
are a sight to see."
Birds are able to work at a higher -flte
than any other animalâ that is, they can
develop more energy in proportion to
weight by working at a highor tempera

Brain Powers
Of the Horse
"Do you think," some one said to tne
recently, "that horses really understand
what is said to them ?"
For answer I raised my voice so as to be
heard by my equine pet feeding upon the
hill above.
"Come down here," I called, "and go
into your stall." She turned, gazed at me
hesitatingly for an instant, and t: en, with
no demur, marched down the hill, pass
ing us with the merest glance of recogni
tion, and fiied obediently into the stable.
But my fr.end was still skeptical. "I
do not believe she really understands,"
she persisted. "She has come to associate
certain words with certain acts, and when
she hears those words she does the asso
ciated acts."
"I grant that," I said, "but will you tell
me what more we humans do in the way
of comprehending language? The horse
does not have as wide a ransre of under
standing as the human being, but so far
as it goes it is ba ed upon exactly anala
gous principles."
It is rather wonderful, when one thinks
about it, now much a clever horse can be
tauzht and how much wisdom he will
puk up by himself without instruction.
I stood on Jones street, near Jackson, a
short time a o and watched a big bay
horse pull a heavy millt-wagon up the
hill. H-' was all alone; there was no one
in the wagon, which was loaded with big |
milkcnns. The grade just here is very j
heavy, and the horse was progressing
diagonally back and forth from curb to
curb at exactly the angle that afforded the
best resistance to the backward sliding of
the wheels, while yet he could steadily
ascend the grade. At each curb he
turned carefully, with one watchful eye
upon his wheels, and not in a single in
stance did he graze the curb or turn so
sharply as to endanger the contents of the
wagon. I watched the performance in
delighted amusement until presently the
driver of the wagon emerged from a
house in the block, milkcan in hand. He
stooped beside me. "You're watching
that there horse, I take it," tie said.
"Well, I suppose fifty people stop and
â watch him every day. He's a knowing
old fellow, that horse, and he taught him
self that tricK when we first put him on
the route. No one ever showed him; he
just studied it out himself."
By this time the br.y horse had reached
the top of the hill and stood upon the
level looking back as if to see why in the I
world his driver was not on hand to con
tinue the journey.
It may be, as scientists tells us, that ani- j
m al& do not think, but I must say that I
have seen horses do things the perform
ance of which involved a process singu
larly like thinking.

The Gold and
the Death of an
Alviso Miser
Of the numerous hermits who have
lived their dreary lives in some of the un
frequented spots in California Benjamin
Rodman is entitled to a place in the front
rank. The possessor of thousands of dol
lars in gold, he chose to spend his days in
misery, and tor twenty-five years occupied
a dilapidated ark on Coyote Creek about
three miles from Alviso. He went about
clothed in rags. He almost starved for
food and slept on a pile of foul rubbish in
his damp cabin. Just how he died will
never be known, for he was alone, and
none knew of his death for months after
ward, when his skeleton was found by
fishermen. The finding of his skeleton
and the holding of the inquest have been
reported in the columns of the daily pa
pers.
Everybody living down that way knew
Benjamin Rodman and despised him, for
he was as disagreeable a man as ever lived.
The finding of his remains was due to the
efforts of his nearest neighbor, the watcn
man at The Bridges, who induced a couple
of men to visit the cabin. As he tells the
story of Rodman it seems too horrible to
be true.
"I've only known Rodman about a
year," said the watchman when speaking
of the matter, "but that is long enough,
for be made my life miserable when he
was alive. The people who have lived
around here a long time tell me that it is
over twenty-five years since Rodman came
to these parts, and that they always looked
upon him as crazy. Nobody knows where
he came from nor anything about him,
but the supposition is that he made money
in the mines, and that it turned his head.
"He lived in peril of his life and said
that he was afraid he would be poisoned.
He spent his time along the banks of the |
edge, our equine camping companion had
the run of a stubble-field in which the
cabin stood. It was our custom to feed
her grain night and morning in a round
basket that when not in use hung upon a
nail quite high up on the side of the house.
One morning, having the nijrht before at
tended some festrviiy or other :n a near
by town, we were Jate in rising, and at
about 9 o'clock we were startled by a loud
knock at the front door. Ha-stily dressing
1 threw open the door to admit our caller,
and WJtfl confronted by Madame, who was
just in the act of repeating her heavy
knock with one iron-sliod foot upon the
doorstep. She had taken the grain-basket
from its nail and brought it to the door,
and as I made my appearance she threw
it down at my feet, with an indignant toss
of the lead, wonderfully expiessive of her
opinion of two women who would lie abed
until that late liour and keep respectable
ponies waiting for breakfast.
It was the same mare who, on another
occasion, by her almost human reason
ableness, saved me from serious injury, if
not from death. I was driving one dark
winter night up a steep, rocky ana peril
ously narrow road, which neither she nor
I had ever before traveled. Behind the
buggy walked a companion, bearing a
lantern. His lantern was of no real use,
as, if carried in front, it blinded both the
mare and the driver, and the road was
too narrow to permit of the light-bearer's
walking beside the buggy, oo we were
blundering along, as best wecould, in the
murky blackness. All at once the mare
stopped, and no urging of mine availed to
make her take another step. I even struck
her with the whip, but to no purpose. I
was in despair. "For the first time in her
life," I said to my companion, "she has
balked. I cannot say that I blame her
much. It is a fearful road."
My friend came around with the lantern
and we saw, within six inches of the right
front wheel, a yawning gully, where the
road had been washed out by the recent
rains. One step further and the vehicle
would have toppled down a steep bank an
almost indefinite distance.
We could teach our horses a great deal
more than we do il we were only willing
to taKe the trouble. I see women every
day go around their carriages and enter at
the side away from the curb because they
apparently do not know that in two or
three lessons the average horse can be
taught to bring the buggy close to the
curb, crank the wheel and wait for his
driver to enter the vehicle. #
There are a number of useful words
which a horse can be taught perfectly to
understand and obey. -'Steady" is a word
I always teach any horse 1 drive often to
understand and heed. It is a good word
to have at your command, the "so-o-o" of

slough hunting for such articles and food
as would be useful to him. It was dan
gerous for anybody to go near his ark, as
he nearly always stood near the door and
pointed a gun at them until they went
away. Nobody suspected that he had any
money until about five years ago, when
he took a shot at the watchman who was

"Of course he was arrested and taken to
San Jose for trial. He was fined $300 or
300 days in jail. To the surprise of every
body he pulled out a sack of gold and
paid his fine. That watchman left the
place soon afterward.
"When I took this job 1 was told to
keep a sharD lookout for him, which I did.
He never came around without his rifle,
and I was afraid that he would shoot at me
any time. He was always in a mean
mood and quarrelsome, but I humored
him and we never had any trouble. He
objected to my being on the marsh, and 1
was afraid he would shoot at me some
night when I went out to tend to the
bridges.
"The last time I saw Rodman alive he
was towing a dead pig to his cabin. He
had found it floating in one of the sloughs
after it had been dead several days and
was ail swelled up. I asked him what he
was going to do with it, and he said he in
tended to cure i^ an<l that it would last
him all summer. That was some time
last April.
"I don't know how long it was after
ward, possibly a cuuole of weeks, when I
noticed that there was never any smoke
coming from the old man's cabin aa there
used to be. I thought something was
wrong then and kept a sharp lookout. I
tried to see him, but he never came along
the sloughs any more. It then struck me

Every horse carries an index to his tem

teachable, tractable animal is broad and
flat between the eyes: the bony ridge of
his face dishes slightly from the point
where tne face narrows, toward the nos
trils. His ears are well set, sensitive and
far ajrmrt, with a well-defined ridge of
bone extending across the top of the head
between them. Always feel for this ridge
in judging a horse. The eye should be

time the accompanying picture was made.

Live Bats Found
Imbedded Deep

served for 15 cents to 25 cents, the marvel
is how can green turtle soup be dispensed
as part of the menu. Here again the
traveler is taken by surprise, and led to
infer that in all the wide world there is
not such a paradise for the man who
thinks much of his dinners.
It barely costs the native a second
thought, so accustomed is he to accept
things as they are, without investigation
of any kind, but it must strike him that
there is some deep down mystery in this
green turtle soup as a course of a cheap
meal.
"Would you like to know how it is
done?" asked an employe of the Pacific
Mail Company. "Then I'll tell you," he
added after a brief pause, while he as
sumed a quizzical air.
"Every time a steamer comes in at the
dock here from Panama, you can see an
o'd man looking for turtles. Generally he
gets one or X wo of them, and hauls them
away in his little cart to bis home on
Third street. Where he lives are also his
office and business headquarters. He
usually keeps a stock of six or eight tur
tles on hand, and with them he makes his
living. Pretty tough on the turtles, but
that makes no difference as long so he
makes it pay. And then, you see, these
prevention of cruelty to animals fellows
don't catch on.
"Well, this fellow gets the big turtles for
a song, and what do you think he does
with them â turn 'em into soup? Not
much. He rents them to restaurants at so
much a day, and moves them from one
place to another, all over town. Mo3t of
his business, though, is south of Market
street.
"The restaurant men leave the turtles
on the sidewalk beside the door and put
out a sign, 'Green turtle soup to-day.'
The turtle's back is painted with the same
sign, and as he sprawls about and peeps
from under bis cover once in a while he
attracts people. You've noticed people
stop to look at the turtles.
"It's a great advertisement and pays
the house well, but none of that turtle
gets into the soup, for he goes to another
eating place next day, and so on. Those
cooks know how to make a good imitasion
with young veal and things. But the rent
from half a dozen or a dozen turtles pays
the old man wjell.
"The turtles don't stand this rough
usage very long. A few weeks settles their
hash, and then they are killed and sold
for a pretty fair price to some restaurant
that dishes up the genuine article. And
this is how the hasheries can have turtles
at their doors once or twice a week."

"Is the bachelor maid a new woman?"
Well, perhaps it is best, so to say ;

But it suits her to put it that way.

As for children she never could stand them,

America Was
Not Named by
the Florentine
It seems safe to assume that nine- tenths
of the native-born Americans are ignor
ant of the real origin of the name of their
mother country. This is not strange, &b
the makers of schoolbooks have taken
particular care and delight to perpetuate
an error born of ignorance. We have
been told time out of mind that it was
Amerrcus Vespucius, a Florentine navi
gator, who, with loud and ponderous
voice, proclaimed himself to Europe as
the discoverer, and with intent to defraud
fastened his name upon the newly found
country. This bit of pseudo history has
been asserted with severe authority and
maintained with asperity, and nothing
but the hand of time can wipe the untruth
from the pages of history, for it requires
the aid of centuries to establish knowl
edge. Recently a movement has been es
tablished in the East, which has met with
more or less success, with the object of
tearing the borrowed robe from the back
of poor "Americus," demanding its resti
tution to its rightful owner, Columbus ( ?).
However laudable this effort is to give
tardy ju3tice to a calumniated reputation
it is founded upon a misconception. It
would only rob the innocent and enthrone
another error, because the first name of
Vespucius was not "Americus" but
"Albericus." Of course exact history
could not take note of auch trifles.
Americ, Amerrique or Amerique is the
name of the high land in Nicaragua, the
high land or mountain range which lies
between Juiealpa and Libertad, in the
province of Chontales, and which reaches
on the one side into the country of the
Corcas Indians and on the other side into
the country of the Ramos Indians.
"Ie" or "ique," used aa a terminal,
means "great."
A nest of live bats were found 100 feet
underground in'Snowshoe Guich, near
Cottaee Grove, in Oregon, the other day.
This is considered a most remarkable dis
covery, and those who have visited the
place and seen the animals are at a loss to
account for it.
John Dinman and Andrew Wilson have
been developing a claim in the gulch by
running a tunnel to reach the vein. The
tunnel runs obliquely, and a few days ago
wden a depth of 150 feet had been reached
the rock began to assume a different con
dition. It sounded loose, or holiow, in
that particular spot, and ihe partners
knew that they were nearing what in.
miner's parlance is called "a chance."
Their "holes" were nearly loaded when
this discovery was made, but they con
tinued loading and then went to the sur
face and touched off the charge. Upon
their return they expected to find a vein
uncovered or at least a rock of different
character from that through which they
were running.
But quite a different matter attracted
their attention when they went back to
the end of the tunnel and the circum
stance has been the wonder of the entire
country ever since. It has created aa
immense amount of discussion, scientifia
and otherwise, but no certain explanation
has yet been adduced.
Instead of finding ore or any particular
change in the rock they found the tunnel
full of bats. The cause of the peculiar
sound that indicated a change of ground
was a small cave and into this their last
shots broke and out of which came the
bacs. How the bats got into the cave is
the problem and what sustained them
there? The point is about 100 feet below
the surface and there is apparently no
opening or means of ingress or exit. The
bats when caught ana taken out to the
daylight appeared to be without eyes and
able to fly but a little ways ; in fact their
wings were butmeagerly developed. The
first thing that attracted the men's atten
tion upon their return to tne tunnel was the
peculiar odor, which, notwithstanding the
amount of gas from the exploded powder,
was quite perceptible and disagreeable.
The only solution of the strange oc
currence that has yet been offered lies in
the fact that the rock is of metamorphic
and aqueous origin, and, being in the
Cascade Range, is of recent occurrence.
The rock is a closely bedded shale, and at
the time of the geological disturbance that
put it into its present position the bats
had their nest there and then became in
casbd as they were found. It would seem,
too, that the bats must be of that nature
that becomes dormant and able to re
tain life without food. An effort was made
to save some of them alive, but they
rapidly succumbed to the sunlight and
fresh air.
THE WIFE.
Now, this last is the nicest new woman;
May her numbers increase everyday!
She's a trimly dressed, pleasant young person,
Who can talk in a sensible way.
She will fall deep in love and gat married :
Of her home she'll b? proud as a queen ;
She will walk step by step with her husband
And with never a shadow between.
She will gather about her the children,
Who will run when they hear mother call,
And she'll sing lullabies in the gloamingâ
"She's the old woman"â so are they all.
Columbus mentions in his fourth voy.
age the village Coriai, probably Oaicai.
The people abounded with sorcerers or
medicine men, and this was the region of
the "Americ" range, 3000 feet high. But
Columbus does not mention the name,
"Americ."
It is stated that the name "America
Province" first appeared upon a map pub
lished at Basle in 1522. Until that time
the region was believed to be a part of
India. This information may be verified
by reference to "The Naturalists in Nica
ragua," by Thomas Belt.
The northmen who visited the conti
nent in the tenth century, according to
TorfÂ«us' "Historia Vrielandiae An
tiquse," found the country a low level
coast thickly covered with wood, and called
it "Markland," from "mark," a wood. The
"r" bad a rolling sound as in Marrick.
A similar word found in the region of the
HiinaJays, and the name of the World
Mountain, Meru, is pronounced in some
dialects as Meruah, ttie letter "h" being
strongly aspirated. It is notable "that
two people could possibly accept a word
of similar sound, each having used it in
their own sense, and finding it applied to
the same territory. "
Professor Wilder remarks it is plausible
that the State of Central America where
we find the name "Americ,'' signifying
(like the Hindu Meru) great mountain,
gave the continent its name. Vespuciua
would have given his surname if he had
designed to give a title to a continent.
It is Vespucius who has been slandered
and to whom restitution is due.
There is more in a name than the world
wota of â even Romeo and Juliet must
have found that out â although a rose by
Any other name would smell as sweet.

Ev>er\j Card a /Message.
Sir William Pole, the great whist philoso
pher, says:
The player Is bound to bear constantly Id mind
that every rard he plays conveys a message to bis
partneras distinctly as If it were written In a letter;
and that if he makes this message untrue by care
lessness or uunecegsarily violating the ordinary
rules of play, even in so small a particular as the
tbrowlnic away of useless cards, be imperils the
joint interests and renders'the great instrument, of
action (the combination of the bunds) of uncertain
eff*ct. ThÂ« necessity of regularity and caw in
the play Is curiously illustrated by the character
of truthfulness generally ascribed 10 It. The
player who violates this regularity, by playing a
card different from that which, as a matter of
routine, 1113 partner would expect him to play, is
said to play 'â¢false," and the card ho played is
called a "false card." â¢ Clay says to Â»uch a person:
"You have told me. as plainly as wh st language
can speak, such and such a fact deduclble from
your play. In no other-position of life would you
tell me that which is untrue; wny do you so here?"
He adds: . â¢,â -,:- ..-.- ..Â»,.,.,- >*â  i,v...-v..â¢;--,-,. â¢.
â¢â¢The best whist-player is he who plays tÃe game
In (be simplest â  way, and I who always . bears in
mind toe great maxim, that It is of more import
ance to give information to his partner than 10
deceive his adversary, r â  ,
"lvalue that player , the most who never de
ceives me, and whose unvarying certainty enables
me, as It were, to play his cards with almost the
same knowledge 01 them as I bave of my own."

Trick 1. Souths hand is of little value un
less he can bring in tbe club suit. He is liable
to lose one trick by leading low instead of
ace, but tbe command of the suit may be of
great va'ue to him.
Trick 3. North can read the entire club suit.
| Neither adversary has called, since West has
j opened up with a plain suit and East has fol
i lowed with the deuce. AH the clubs under
! the six, therefore, are in Souths hand; and,
I since he would not have led low from X, J,
10 and so many small cards, bis three cards
above tha six are A, J, 10. The X is, ac
cordingly, bare in the hands of one of the ad
versaries.
North therefore leads trumps to make the
clubs if possible. As the J is turned South
plays 10, and returns Q in the next trick.
West plays the 9 for the purpose of mis
leading South into the idea that the final com
mand of trumps is with East, and if possible
dissuading him from returning the lead.
Trick 7. North, having exhausted the
trumps, returns the C. 9, and South reaps the
reward of tbe patience and foresight exhibited
by his original low lead.
And the overplay shows a loss of six tricks.

Table 2. South at this table opens with the
conventional lead of ace.
Trick 2. The fall in the first trick does not
show which band is out, and South can do
nothing except to con ti nuc his suit. Be leads
fourth best of those remaining although this
is of little consequence.
Trick 4. North can read five clubs remain-
Ing in Souths hand, leaving but five cards to
be divided between the three other suits. It
isnotsnft) for him to return hearts as the ad
versaries are in full control, and he cannot
tell whether South is out of the suit or not;
there is nothing whatever for him to lead
trumps for, and he is driven to open bis nu
merically long but utterly wealc suit of
diamonds.
TrlcK 5. East perhaps had better lead trumps
i at this point as the heart suit Is with his part
ner, and he has a fair control of diamonds. He
; has reason : to believe, however, that North is
strong , in trumps, and i dislikes to lead ut> to
him. ; , He prefers to retain the tenace Jin dia
monds and so leads to his partner's previously
established suit.

double purpose of informing his partner with
certainty tbat the clubs are all with him and
inviting him to carry on the cross ruff. North
accordingly out-trumps the turn card and re
turns nearrt to force South.
Trick 8. North again trumps high in order
to make the queen if it is in Soutli's hand by
forcing with the diamond.
Trick 10. West trumps with his best trump
in order to shut out any small trump iv
Norths hand and prevent the forcing of his
partner's Jack. The fall of the trey shows him
the desirability of continuing with trumps in
the eleventh trick. The remaining tricks of
course fall to East.
Had East at trick 5 led a trump he would
have saved a trick and made a gain of six over
the play at the other table.
Editorial Comments. â At the Trist Club
rooms last Wednesday afternoon our whist
editor explained why the fourth best should
be led from ace and four or five others not in
cluding king or queen, Jack. We also stated
all whist-playefs of the first rank indorsed
this play. The above is a practical example o[
a low-card- lead from eight in suit. This deal
came in play in President Barney's whist
club in Providence, R. 1., a short time ago.
TRIST DUPLICATE WHIST CLUB.
Last Tuesday evening the first twenty-four
of the forty-eight deals played in the Rideout
trovhy match between the Vallejos and Oak
lands was put into play. The average scores
made North and South at eight tables were
150. Vallejo North ana Bouth made on the
same deals 153 and Oakland's 144. At the
Trist Club in one of the bands North opened
with ace spades, followed by jack â East
dropped the ten and West the eight, South
playing the king. South with four trumps and
one spade declined to lead a trump and came
with a small diamond. After the deal was
played a discussion arose in the "whist
morgue " The North player made this state
ment, which is correct, that there was no ex
cuse for not leading trumps, from his holding
ho should always do so, and even fr om three
with an established suit in partner's hand.
"Exceptions" were taken. Our advice to all
whist Â«tudents is never fail to lead a trump at
that stage of the game, from four or three and
oftentimes less.

Those present were : Mrs. Adolph Fine, Mrs.

ciates of Mr. Davies, who, after a period of fif
teen years' service in tbe general office of the
Royal Insurance Company, has severed his
connection and become the junior member of

On Wednesday evening, September 30, a sur

Arrangements were made for Miss Edmonds
to spend the day away from home, and advan
tage was taken of her absence to decorate the
house.
In the handsome parlors autumn flowers
were used for decorative purposes. Bright
nasturtiums and clusters of golden marigolds
were arrayed tastefully with a delicate net
work of greenery.
Palms were, arrayed throughout the recep
tion hall, where a string orchestra discoursed
many popular and catchy airs.
Amid such inviting and pleasant surround
ings the hours passed very pleasantly In
dancing, games, vocal and instrumental music.
brary Association will give a progressive whis
or euchre reception and party in their room
in the Mercantile Library building on Wednes
day evening, October 21. No one that re
ceives an invitation should stay away. It is
given for the benefit oi the library.
We note that the erstwhile chess cham
pion (?) Mr. Thompson has seen fit to withdraw
from the tournament at present going on at
the Mechanics' Institute. The only known
reason for this "move" was the fact that in
his first game with a young "green" player he
was at least not gstting the best of the play.
We are confident no whist-player would act as
unsportsmanlike in a similar case.
William Mill Butler, auther of "Whist In a
Nutshell," is about to issue a new edition, and
has invited our whist editor to assist in its re-
Vision. It would be a most excellent idea to
wait until after the seventh congress. The
laws will be revised, and the same should ap
pear in every whistbook.
R. F. Foster, whist editor of the New York
Sun, writes us that the Rocheste* (N. Y.j Post-
Express has started a whist column. In a
postscript Mr. Foster advises us not to read
"Boardman's Winning Whist," as it is full of
short-suit heresy. If Mr. Foster will read the
Sunday Call's whist articles he will see there
the position we take as regards "short-suit ism."
PLUCKY VALLEJOS ONCE MORE THE
VICTORS.
Saturday last the crack team of four from
the Oakland Whist Club went to Vallejo to
bring back the Rideout trophy captured by
the Vallejo Club in a match with the San
Franciscos a few weeks ago. The Oaklanders
say that no less than six battle-ships, headed
by the Oregon and Monterey, prevented the
capture of the tro.phy, but tbe Vallejo boys
without asiruggle surrendered everything else,
nothing wa^ too good for the visitors, The
president of the association refereed the match.
Game was called at 2 p.m. Twenty-four deals
were played in the afternoon and twenty-four
In the evenine. The Call will publish some

' Californians
In New York
NEW ITORK, N. V., Oct. 6.â A ruddy
faced Californian told me the other morn
ing that politics seemed like a tonic to the
majority of men, while to him the very
thought of politics was enervating in the
extreme. "To tell you the truth," he
heartily explained, "I ran away from the
coast just to escape politics. I shall return
just in time to vote, and, by the wayâ this
is strictly entre noua â for the first time
in eighteen years I will not vote the Dem
ocratic ticket." I'll not give his name,
that, at least, shall remain "entre nous."
Captain Thomas Mem has returned
from the shores of Africa. He has been
wonderfully successful since he left Cali
fornia, having cleared, it is said, over
$1,000,000 in African mines. His head
quarters were at Johannesburg, and as
superintendent of mines he has been a
very buÃy man during his absence from
California. Before returning to California
Captain Mem, his wife and family will
visit relatives in St. Lawrence County,
N. Y.
Charles Dexter said a very pertinent
thing the other day, just before leaving.
A number of friends were bidding him
good-by when he remarked in a far-away
voice: "Weil, I've decided that the West
is God's land, and California is as near
heaven as I ever want to be," Mr. Dexter
seemed to be so impressed with his own
r sentiments that his Gotham friends are
actually planning an extended pilgrimage
to heaven â California.
Kari Howard has recovered sufficiently
from his illness to be up and about. His
mother, Mrs. Charles Webb Howard, ac
companied him and his brother, Shafter
Howard, to Boston.
Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Carrigan and H.

O. M. Brennan, proprietor of the Pleas

It seems but last week that Billy Emer
son and Charlie Reed were the "jolly end
men" at the little Standard Theater on
Bush street. How we used to laugh at
their funny stories and wonder how dear
oid, deep-voiced Friilman could sit as
"middle-man" and never crack a
smile.
Our jaw-hinges have grown rusty for
sooth, and we do not laugh as readily as
we used to. Simplicity of taste is lost in
the wild extravagance of spectacular I
plays, aerial ballets and vaudeville per- i
formances. Poor Charlie Reed closed his
jolly eyes with a sigh when death took
him several years ago. To-day Billy Em
erson, not quite as good-looking as be
used to be, is "doing a turn" at the big
vaudeville houses. The other evening at
Proctor's there were a number of San
Franciscans scattered through the house,
and, to make it seem more homelike, a
party of well-known Californians occupied
a box near tbe stage and laughed at and
applauded Billy Emerson just for "Auld
Lang Syne." They were "Billy" Miner,
Frank Corcoran, "Harry" Pearson, Ted
Tichnor aud "Lou" Hanchett.
k J. Spitz, merchant, is at the Marlbor-
Tough.
A. F. Reed has decided not to take his
usual European trip this fall, but devote
the time before election to visiting friends
and relatives in the East and taking a
long-deserved rest. He will be in San
Francisco the first part of December.
Mrs. S. E. Pape and Mrs. Cyrus Walker
Lured by a Mirage
While Thirsting on
the Desert Sands
John WickerÃham of Los Anjreles, who
for some months past has been riding an
Indian pony in the Northwest, partly for
his health and partly while prospecting
for gold, has returned here on his way
home. He says there is a stretch of desert !
lying between the Columbia River and
what is known as Coulee City, in the
Moses Coulee of the Big Bend country in
Washington, that enormously surpasses
in dreariness anything that he has ever
before seen. Mr. Wickersham carried
pick and pan with him on this trip; he
was also provided with a roll of blankets
and a lariat for roping bis pony. His
p.- visions consisted chiefly of a piece of
bacon, some prepared coffee, some flour,
. sugar and salt. The culinary outfit was
jk as light as it was possible to make it. In
way, with only a single 45-caliber
pistol to defend him, he moved about,
camping each night wherever he might be.
"I have seen and heard a great deal
about dreary stretches of country," said
Mr. Wickersham yesterday. "I have been
on the plains of Colorado and Arizona, and
on the Mojave and Colorado deserts in
California; I have also been in the dry
regions about the Humboldt Sink in
Nevada. Tney are fearful in their desola
tion. However, 1 passed over a region in
the Big Bend country that is, if possible,
more frightful than any of these. I came
near famishing there for want of water,
my pony was completely fagged out, and it
was only with the greatest exertion that I
managed finally to get through to Coulee
City. This dreary stretch of desert extends
for a distance of. for y miles along Foster
Creek, from the mouth of the creek to a
point nearly on the high tableland on the
south. It must have been merely in de
rision that the broken gulch was called a >
creel:, for during no year from the time of
which the memory of man runs was there
ever any water in its bed, except at the
lower portion during freshets. Into this
ghastly region, not knowing that there
was really no water there, I went on my
exploring trip. Foster Creek winds by
some chalk-white cl.ffs for several miles
south of the Columbia, and finally, when
the trail made by the Indians leaves this
goree, you traverse an almost level stretcn
of sandy desert. On either side are great
bAre places, as white as the chalky cliffs.
H>ese mark places that are poisoned by
alkali, so that, even if there was water
nothing could grow there.
"In traversing all this long distance I
saw no livin? thing except a few horned
toads and some enrious brown birds that
had no tails. What the birds lived on I
cannot tell. Aside from these there was
of San Francisco are at a Fifth-avenue
hotel.
Mrs. Amy Strong of San Diego is in the
city.
Mrs. Ira Pierce and her daughter ar
rived last Wednesday.
Dr. George N. Robinson of Los Angeles
reached the city on Friday evening. His
health is very poor, and he hopes to bene
fit it by his journey East.
William L. Whitwell is at the Waldorf.
Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Sharon and Miss
Sharon arrived from the West Friday, and
are stopping at the Park-avenue Hotel.
This hostelry was originally built by that
wonderful old millionaire, A. T. Stewart,
for the purpose of providing a home for
professional and working women. The
scheme was a magnificent one, and should
have succeeded. Discord among the
"powers that were" caused the project to
fall through, and tbe immense structure
was shortly afterward converted into a
first-class hotel.
Mrs. George W. Baldwin paid a flying
visit to her father, "Lucky" Baldwin, this
week.
On her way home she will join her hus
band in Cincinnati. Together they will
visit a week or two with relatives in
Ohio, and then proceed westward.
"Lucky" Baldwin has done very little
with his stable this season. He has every
confidence in the "string, 11 however, and
expects big innings later on.
W. S. Hobart will ship his Del Monte
stable in a few days, when it will be en
tered for the winter races in California.
Ferrier has made a remarkable record
I during the Sheepshead Bay meeting. He
has won a good share of money, and nis j
behavior has been enough to make his
owner, Mr. Hobart, and his trainer, Mr.
Hunn, very proud of him.
There are a lot of great men's sons in
New York just now. There's Blaine'sand
Grant's, Garfield's and Harrison's, Sher
man's and Ingersoil's, and yet the world
never hears of them as having done any
thing great enough to be recorded. Wny
is it? May be they are too young to have
derided what will make them great
quickest and with the least trouble. They
all have time to be heard from, for none
of them is over 42.
Frank Brown, who divides his time be
tween Idaho, Utah and California, has
been in New York for several weeks. He
has succeeded in placing his Idaho
properties at a handsome profit.
Every baldheaded man who has a back
yard to sit in or a fire-escape to stand on
is congratulating himself these days be
cause some wise noddle has discovered
that a fine new crop of hirsute decoration
will sprout and grow on a bald pate if the
pate is exposed a given time each day to
the warm rays of the sun. It will not be
very long ere there will be as many bald
headed sun- worshipers as there are bars
footed grass- waikers. Already a number
of the faddists are combining the two
"new wrinkles" and walk over the dewy
sun-kissed grass with bare feet and un
covered heads.
One can't blame men nowadays for be
coming alarmed at their baldheaded
futures. The majority of men have very
thin locks, even if they have not arrived
at the perfectly bald stage. There seems
to be considerable philosophy and good
reason in the open-air sun bath. What's
the need of hats, anyhow?
Thick felt hats and deadly dyed beavers
are undoubtedly very destructive to the
hair follicles and sabaceous glands. At
least, there will be no harm done in try
ing thu "bareheaded sun shower."
Trella Foltz Tolaxd.
no bird, no animal, nothing in the air or
on the earth ; the sun beat down fright
fully with a baleful glare; it was so hot
that presently I was so overcome i could
scarcely sit on my horse. Riding over
j this desert one becomes desperate; what
| he has been becomes a memory, and over
come by the thirst and heat you feel as if
yon had been projected into a new and
strange world. In trying to reach the
hamlet of Coulee City, which is on a
branch railroad from Spokane, I took the
wrong trail at a point on the desert, and
for a time I was lost.
"It was while I was lost on this desert
that I saw a beautiful lake before me. It
could not have been more than a mile
away and came suddenly into view. I
wondered that I had not seen it before.
As I rode toward it I saw that some wil
lows were growing on the opposite side of
it. and to my right was some waving
green grass. At the same time a refresh
ing breeze swept over my face. I thought
I would soon have plenty of water and 1
pushed forward as fast as I could to
ward it.
"Strange to say, my pony showed no
energy, and I was surprised at this, for you
know that a horse half famished as mine
was can scent water even if is ten miles
away, and as this was in full sight I could
not make out what the trouble was. I
urged the pony forward and must have
ridden a mile in this way, and still the
lake drew no nearer. I had thought that
in the distance I saw wifd fowl on the
lake, and my perplexity increased; sudden
ly it dawned on me that this was no lake,
but that it was a mirage, which in truth
it was. Then I made all possible haste to
retrace my steps, but the pony was nearly
fagged out.
"By dint of great exertion I managed to
get him back over the plains, and at last,
after two days of struggling. I reached a
little house about five miles from Coulee
City, where a lonely rancher had inclosed
a little piece of ground and dug a well.
There I got water, was enabled to re
cuperate, and at length pushed on to the
railroad. Talk about frightful stretches
of country, that is the most grewsome and
weirdly fearful of any that I ever saw. I
want no more experience like the one I
have just had. Even gold would not
tempt me to go again into a country like
that"

A Remarkable Carving
From a Mammoth Tusk
There has recently been brought to the
attention of the French Academy a very
rare and valuable curio in the shape of an
ivory statue of Christ.
It was carved by the celebrated Fran
cois Girardon in the latter part of the
seventeenth century, and afterward be
longed to Marie Antoinette. At the time
of her execution (1793) an inventory was
taken of the royal possessions at Ver
sailles, but a member of the Bourbon
family had removed this treasure and
hidden it away, and for this reason no
mention of it appears in the list. Twelve
years ago it was sold to M. Durey, who
resides at 208 Avenue dv Maine, Paris.
An ordinary engraving can convey no
adequate idea of the exquisite workman
ship of this statue. The anatomy is per
fect and the portrayal ol suffering ad
mirably realistic.
The image measures from the crown to
the feet 1 meter 3 centimeters, or 3 feet 4>Â£
inches, the entire length being carved of
one piece. The arms and the knot in the
An Alameda Hay Field
Like an Egyptian Plain
To properly care for bay has always
been a hard problem for the rancher of
California. The danger of spontaneous
combustion being great made it unwise to
put it in a barn, as the event of fire only
made the loss that much greater. Cover
ing it with tarpaulins and leaving it in
the field has long been the accepted
method, although sure to cause some loss
on account of rain producing mold on
the top of the stack. But it was the best
known and the loss less than the loss of a
barn and possibly several head of stock.
The latest method adopted by the ranch
ers of Alameda County is to construct a
sort of frameworK of scantlings ana cover
it with thin canvas. This method keeps
the canvas some distance from the hay
and at the same time sheds the water as
good as the roof of a barn. It also has the
advantage of being cheap.
The effect produced on the landscape by
this method, however, is most startling
and calculated to make a man rub his
eyes the -first time he sees a field covered
with the atranga looking white pyramids.
drapery are added, but are of the same
ivory. Its weight is 35 kilos, or 77 pounds.
The breast measures 49>Â£ centimeters, or
19)4 inches in circumference. These di
mensions prove that the ivory is of ante
diluvian origin, for no elephant tusk of
the present aze is of such size as to fur
nish these proportions in a single piece.
To understand this better we must con
sider the structure of a tusk. It is not, as
some suppose, bard, solid ivory from base
to tip, but is hollow for about half its
length. In life this cavity is filled with a
pulpy substance. Its diameter is not pro
portionate with the outside diameter of
the tusk, but decreases more rapidly, com
ing to a point about halfway from the
base of the tusk. From this point a dis
colored line extends through the solid por
tion of the tusk to its outer end, and about
this line center the delicate latitudinal
markings of the grain. It is thus easy to
distinguish from wnat part of the tusk
(diametrically considered) any article is
made. In the proximal portion of a large
Houses are scarce down that way, so that
there is nothing to jar on the impression.
For twenty miles along the bay shore
almost any part of it looks like the plain
of Egypt. Only the trees and the strange
looking haystacks, shaped exactly like the
great pyramids, are to be seen.
They are scattered all over the fields
and large enough to dwarf most of the
other objects in the landscape. Some of
these stacks are at least forty feet high
and few less than thirty. The small oaks
and young eucalyptus trees help out the
illusion.
In the early evening when there is just
light enough to make out the different
objects the effect shows to the best advan
tage. The cauvas ceases to be canvas and
becomes stone. The different pyramids
seem to rise to twice their real size.
Nothing is wanting to make the beholder
think he is in the land of the Nile, and if
he has ever been there he will instinctively
stOD and listen expecting to hear the cry
of the donkey boys urging their unwilling
beasts to action.
sized tusk there is a goodly amount of ,
ivory, for the walls of the cavity thicken
rapidly from the base upward, but for a
statue of the dimensions given above the
solid half of the tusk only could have been
used.
Although the tusks of the extinct mam
moth do not always taper so rapidly in
proportion to their length as do those of
the elephant yet the circumference of the
base of this one must have been at least
thirty incbes, and perhaps more. It is in
teresting to speculate upon how Monsieur
Girardon came into possession of the rare
geological relic from which he chiseled
this masterpiece of art. The fact that the
majority of mammoth tusks are much
curved, often forming almost complete
circles, and thus can be utilized only to a
limited extent by tbe sculptor, renders his
prize the more remarkable.
M. Durey has been offered $60,000 for
the statue, but considers it worth $100,000.
He has, however, expressed his willing
ness to submit it to connoisseurs and let
them determine a price. Tne party who
made the offer of $60,000 referred the mat
ter to the great painter, Meissonier, since
deceased, who stated that $60,000 was too
low a sum, since this statue is "unique in
the world, and its value inestimable, not
only as ivory but also as an 'objet dart. "
Various members of the academy have
been called upon to set a price, but their
reports have not yet been forwarded.
Another notable Ivory Btatue of Christ
exists in the old papal palace at Avignon,
but it is much smaller and is made in
sections.
It is a matter of conjecture what associ
ation or individual will secure the great
art treasure now awaiting a tender of ap
preciation long withheld. Possibly Ameri
can wealth and zeal may win the day and
effect its removal to this side of the Atlan
tic, where it will grace a classic museum
or inspire the hearts of worshipers in some
New World cathedral.
A NEW ENVELOPE.
You Pull the String and the Letter
Flies Open*
P. B. Gillette of Grass Velley has in-
vented several novel and useful kinds of
envelopes, all of which seem to be great
improvements over the ordinary letter
envelope now in use.
One of his designs presents a self-sealing
envelope that cannot be opened without
detection. The outside flap is cut bias
and has a fastening on the reverse side
that is quite novel in its way.
Another design was the flap cut square,
but the method of fastening is secure and
quite original.
Perhaps the greatest and most useful
invention on both of these envelopes lies
in the silk thread " that hangs out at the
end and at the back of the envelopes.
Pull this thread and the envelope is
opened neatly and expeditiously. This
part of the invention is one that will com
mend itself to every business man.
Mr. Gillette has secured patents on his
inventions, and is now in San Francisco
preparing for the manufacture of his nov
elties in envelopes.
A Mill Valley Dog That
Pumps Water for Cattle
Dog-motors are plentiful enough in
Belgium and a few other parts of Europe,
but they must surely be conceded to be a
rarity in California. Many people who
have traveled all over the State say they
have never seen any. But there is one at
least, and that is not very far from San
Francisco. It is on the Swiss ranch on top
of the hill to the westward of Mill Valley.
It is in plain sight from the road and hun
dreds of people passing that way wonder
what it is. They may see it turning
around at a good speed, but few would
think that the motive power was gener
ated by a dog. This motor has been in use
for two years and a most cheap and ser
viceable machine it has proved to be. The
cost is trifling, not the twentieth part of
what a windmill would cost, and for the
purpose nothing could be better. One dog
can easily pump water for a herd of 200
cattle. And the best of it is some dogs
like the work.
Dog-motors are built on the same prin
ciple as the exercising runs that are often
attached to cages for. squirrels and other
small animals. They are really barrels
made so that the dog can get in and out at
a place near the bottom, and aa soon as be
starts to run on the inside the barrel
slides from under his feet. In this way it
rotates as fast as the dog runs.
The motive power of the machine is
communicated to the pump by means of a
crank that connects with a piston and
sucker of ordinary type. Revolving the
motor causes the piston to rise and fall
the same as if a man were working the
handle.
For over a year the dog- motor on the
bill back of Mill Valley has been operated
by a dog named Gyp, and she really likes
the work and knows more about pumping
water than half of the men in the State.
When Gyp was first put into the machine
she knew just what she had to do, and
started in at a great rate. She ran so fast
that she would have fallen from exhaus
tion had she not been lifted out. But as
she has" grown older at the business she
has learned better. Bat she likes the
work as much as when she started. When
Gyp first started in to pump water she did
not know when to stop. She pumped and
pumped until the tank ran over all the
time. In a few weeks though she was
taught that all she was expected to do was
to keep the tank full and now she doesn't
do any more.
When Gyp is taken to the motor in the
morning she first looks Into the trough to
see how much it lacks of being full. She
then works accordingly and when she
thinks she has done enough runs oat and
takes a look at it. If it is full she lies
down and rests and if there are still a
few inches remaining she starts in again
and does not stop until the troueh is run
ning over.
All the water that Gyp pumps i? for cattle
to drink. It flows directly from the well
into the drinking- trough, so that they can
get It without trouble. Gyp knows sn soon
as she sees a band of steers making for
the trough what they are after and she
starts in pumping, so as to keep them from
emptying it. Her idea seems to be to keep
the trough full. In tact, she is unable to
rest unless she knows it is in that condi
tion. Gyp has to work hard to do her
work. Each stroke of the pump brings
up about a quart of water and she has
to make about six jumps to do it; but
when she feels like working nothing stops
her and the pumps make at least ten
strokes a minn te or perhaps 500 gallons of
water in ten hours.
Gyp ia the only dog on the ranch that
has ever liked the work. Others have
been tried, but it is always necessary to
lock them in to keep them from jumping
the job. Even Gyp's brothers always had
business elsewhere whenever they thought
there was any pumping to do. There was
one, though, that was a good worker. He
used to get so mad at being put in the
motor that he seemed trying to wear it
out for spite. He used to run and run
until the axle fairly smoked, but as soon
as he saw that he couldn't do the machine
any harm he curled up in the bottom and
went to sleep.

Patriotism, Protection

FOR PRESIDENTâ
WILLIAM McKINLEY, Of OHIO
â FOR TICK-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, JS96.
What has become of Coxey this year?
What's the matter with Republican har
mony now?
Get into line for Charles L. Taylor and
show your party loyalty.
Every Democrat the party was proud of
has ceasea to be proud of the party.
Get into line for Colonel Taylor and you
will find Republican harmony all around
you.
As politics warm up the weather grows
cooler and nature tempers the wind to the
overheated lamb.
There is only one way to drive Buccley
and Rainey out of politics and that is to
put Colonel Taylor in office.
If Bryan does not stoD his ridiculous
talk about coercion he will soon become
known as the National Silly Billy.
The Chicago free-silver parade seems to
have been half a razzle-dazzle, half a mas
querade and altogether a farce.
Watson's plan to make the campaign
on a sectional issue was bad, but Bryan's
scheme of making it a class issue is worse.
It appears at first sight that the Demo
cratic leaders are lost, but really they are
just where they were. It is the party that
is lost.
The Democrats havi* at last found out
what their hand-organs are best fitted for
and have set them to wort pas3ing the hat
for nickels.
Why should any Republican sit on the
fence and swear at the Supreme Court
when he can get into line and march with
the music?
Silver Democrats are both demoralized
and moneyless, but the old gold fellows
are holding fast to their morals and their
money too.
Election day is now near enough for the
time to be counted by days instead of
weeks. The jubilee is at hand and good
times are coming.
As Cleveland has declined to make a
speech for the gold Democrats it is evi
dent that he is favoring the movement by
every means in his power.
Why should the Republicans of ' San
Francisco fight a losing battle with one
another when they can unite and fight a
winning battle against Democracy and the
bosses ?
Don't permit other issues of the cam
paign to lead you to overlook the move
ment for woman suffrage. Remember the
Republican party is pledged to support it
and must keep the pledge.
All the best trade journals in the coun
try predict an immediate revival of bnsi
ness after the election of McKinley. They
understand the situation and have faith in
the advance agent of prosperity.
The argument for protection has be
come so absolutely unanswerable in this
country that arguments for free trade
have been made literally untalkable. You
never hear them even on the streets.
The Democratic tomtoms may divert
the attention of the people from the tariff
issue whiie they are on the streets, but as
soon as they go home and begin to talk
over work and wages they are confronted
by it again.
Bryan tells the farmers Chat free silver
will enable them to get better prices for
their products and he tells workingmen
their wages will have the same purchasing
power as at present. It is evident that if
the boy orator hasn't everything of genius
he has at least its versatility.
As the meaning and the merits of inter
national bimetallism Decome understood
by the people the silver craze subsides
and the stanchest advocates of the re
monetization of silver are leaving the Bry
anite camp and returning to the party of
protection and sound money.
Some of the men who bolted the Repub
lican county organization, protested
against the action of Registrar Hinton
and boltea from the decision of the State
Central Committee are now talking of
bolting the decision of the Supreme Court.
Their next move will probably be to bolt
the United States.
The silliest thing in the history of
American politics was the appearance of a
number of men in the free-silver parade
in Chicago wearing masks, under the pre
tense of a fear their employers would dis
charge them if they were recognized. A
congenital idiot could hardly do anything
more ridiculous than that.
THE AMERICAN BALLOT.
The current number of the Forum con
tains an article upon the American ballot
by Hugh H. Lusk, an ex-member of the
New Zealand Legislature and a resident
for many years of the Antipodes. After
some well-worded reflections upon the
motives which influence and the methods
w ich mislead the mind of the average
voter, the writer proceeds to explain the
essential differences between the present
American system of voting and its origi
nal, the Australian system, upon which
it is supposed to be modeled. After ex
plaining these divergences, Mr. Lusk pro
ceeds to contrast the two systems, quite to
the detriment of the American plan.
Among the notable departures of the
American from the Australian system,
Mr. Lusk lays especial emphasis upon the
following, with respect to the registration
of voters under the Australian system: It
ia not left to the discretion of the citizen
to claim registration; the Government
compels it, and by a system of public in
spection sees to it that the name of every
person entitled to vote is entered upon the
register, and that the name of every per
son not entitled to vote is removed from
it. The electoral roll thus prepared and
purged is not open to challenge upon the
day of election, and thus all confusion or
delay arising from the exercise of chal
lenges during our election are entirely
avoided under the Australian plan.
Another essential difference in the two
systems is that in Australia no two issues
are ever mixed at a single election. Mem
bers of the Legislature are chosen at one
time and the municipal officials at an
other. While this makes elections fre
quent, it lessens the degree of their im
portance, and therefore of their inter
ference with business which inheres under
the American plan.
In Australia election days are not holi
days, nor are there any of the outward
evidences of public interest in them which
form so insistent a part of the American
election. The ballot also, which is to be
voted at any single election, is a small and
simple affair compared with our blanket
ballots, and all party designations are
omitted from it. The names of the can
didates being placed upon the ballot by
the Government officials conducting the
election the voter, instead of marking by
a cross or otherwise the names of those for
whom he wishes to vote, obliterates the
names of those for whom he does not.
With these elements of simplicity in the
Australian system it is claimed that a
single polling-place will easily accommo
date eight or ten thousand voters between
8 in the morning and 4 in the after*
noon, while less than as many hundred
can be accommodated between sunrise
and sunset of an American election day.
It must ba confessed by those who be
lieve that our present system of voting is
in advance of that existing prior to its
adoption that there are distinct superiori
ties in the original Australian system
which we have failed to transplant to our
own. It must also be admitted that pur
attempts at improvement of the Austra
lian original have not been successful.
We have robbed it of its simplicity in our
endeavor to adapt it to what has ap
peared to our politicians to be the essen
tial peculiarities of American politics, and
have introduced elements of confusion,
which, unless they are speedily removed,
will endanger the success and existence
of the entire system.
It only requires a glanco at our Califor
nia experience to discover these defects.
Ever since the so-called Australian ballot
law became a part of our political system,
our courts have been occupied in the at
tempt to unravel its intricacies. Every
election campaign seems to bring to the
surface an increasing crop of problems for
the courts to solve, and their solution ap
pears only to develop a new series of
conundrums. During the past month,
the Supreme Court of the State of Cal
ifornia has been mainly occupied with
these tangles, to the exclasion of other
business far more important to the rights
of the average citizen; and this Is but a
repetition of its experience during prior
campaigns. If these conflicts over the
construction and application of our ballot
Jaw ended with election day, there would
be less reason for complaint, but they do
not and *ill not so end.
Every recent election hÂ«ld in California
has resulted in a cloud of contests, which
bring to the surface evidences of the con
fusion, uncertainty and error into which
electors have fallen in their enaeavor to
obey the law. It is becoming more and
more apparent that the American ballot
system must be purged of these evils be
fore it can be credited with being the suc
cess which at the time of its adoption its
admirers claimed for it.
This year, as in every crisis In the
history of the country, men of all par
ties are uniting together. Men who
have been Democrats, men who have
belonged to other political parties in
the past, loving their country and its
honor more than they love party, are
with us this year. We welcome them
all, and standing together I am quite
sure that on the 3d day of November
the verdict will teach the whole world
that the American people love honeity,
and that the American Government will
maintain it* financial houor at any
cost.â McKinley.
RESPEOT FOB LAW.
One of the strongest and worthiest quali
ties of the American people is their re
spect for law. Without that quality in
herent and dominant in the National
character it would be impossible to main
tain a republican form of government.
T is is so self-evident that all true pa
triots regard with more than ordinary
concern every evidence of a tendency,
either in the press or on the stamp, to ex
cite the minds of the people against the
courts, or to weaken the popular respect
for the established law of the land.
In view of the incessant attacks now
being made by the Bryanites against the
Supreme Court of the United States it Is
in the highest degree important that all
Republicans and conservative Democrats
should be emphatic and united in uphold
ing the authority of the courts and si
lencing those who either directly or by in
sinuation endeavor to weaken that au
thority by traducing the Judges.
\Ve have in our own City an evil of this
kind to condemn and guard against. The
action of the Supreme Court of the State in
deciding questions arising under the elec
tion laws has necessarily been adverse to
one of the parties in each contest. In
several instances the defeated parties in
stead of submitting to the decision with a
proper respect for the law have sought to
distort the effect of the decisions on the
public mind by unjustly and unfaliiy
criticizing the Justices who made them.
No intelligent man sincerely questions
the honesty of our Supreme Court, and
certainly none should question it for the
sake of paitisan or factional discontent.
The decisions given have been impartial,
and express the judgment of trained legal
minds on the issues before the court. It
is presumptuous in men who are not
lawyers and who speak without either
professional or official responsibility to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1896.
criticize and condemn the Judges of the
courts on mere political grounds. We
have had too much of tbat kind of thing
already. It is time for patriot citizens to
assert themselves and put to scorn the
loose-tongued traducers of our Judges and
our courts.
I do not believe there are many men in
this country, no matter what they have
t bought in the past, who will not now
say that free trade, or go-called tariff
reform, has proved by the experience of
the past four years to be a signal and
disastrous failure. It has failed, utterly
failed, in every prophecy, promise and
expectation. It has not secured a single
thing that its advocates said would fol
low its adoptionâ not one. More, it has
not served a single American interest.
It has served the interests of other na
tions of the world, but has given no
benefit to the American people. â Mc-

A SILLY PRETENSE.
In the parade of the Bryanitesat Chicago
on Friday night, we are told that a num
ber of men marched with their faces
masked, for fear that they would be dis
charged if they were recognized by their
employers. A sillier freak than this has
never been known in the history of Ameri
can politics. It could have originated only
in the mind of a man utterly ignorant of
the courage and self-respecting manhood
of the American people. It would have
been an insult to workingmen if it bad
not been too silly to be taken seriously.
It has been a common cry with the
Democrats that t!ie people were bribed
and bought by rich corporations, and that
cry was foolish enough, as all the world
knows. The new cry of coercion carries
folly to the verge of lunacy. There is no
intimidation in any State north of Mason
and Dixon's line. Even in ts>e Southern
States it is practiced only to a compara
tively small extent, and exercised only
over negroes, who are too poor, too ignor
ant and too much subject yet to the in
fluences of slavery to know how to assert
their rights and to maintain them.
In the North and West there is a free bal
lot and a fair count. No American em
ployer coerces his labor, tries to coerce it
or even desires to coerce it. It is safe to
challenge the orators and organs of the
fusion party to name one single employer
who has made or shown signs of making
the slightest attempt to intimidate his
employes in any manner whatever.
The Bryan campaign is, in fact, rapidly
degenerating into a farcical and almost
fraudulent affair. Deserted by the abler
and more self-respecting leaders of the
Democratic party the fusion managers
have sunk from low to lower levels at
every stage of the canvass. Incapable of
argument, incapable of an effective man
agement of the affairs of the party, they
have come at last to resort in National
affairs to styles of electioneering that
would be a jest and a byword in ward pol
itics. The charge of bribing American
workingmen was bad enough. The
charge of coercion is idiocy.
The silverites tell us the act of 1873
was log-rolled through Congress, and
honest men knew nothing about it until
the law wag passed. The fact ig that
that legislation was under discussion
from April, 1870, till February, 1873,
and one of its warmest supporters wag
Senator Jones from the silver State of
Nevada They tell us, too, that the act
of 1873 struck down one-half of tlie
people's money. Yet while from 1792
till 187 3 we had coined only a little
more than 8100,000,000 in silver, since
1873 we have coined 8431,000,000 in
silver. â Ex-Governor FifVr of Illinois.
DEMOCRATIO LOSSES.
As the reports come in from Georgia
nnd Florida, it is disclosed that the Demo
crats have suffered heavy losses even in
these States where the Republicans had
no expectation of success. Moreover,
there is reason to believe that had the vote
been cast and counted fairly the losses
would have been greater than are now
shown, and bourbon Democracy would
have been shattered in its strongholds.
It requires no great acumen to see what
the falling off of the Democratic vote in
Georgia and Florida means. Conserva
tive Democrats have refused to follow the
party into the Bryanite camp, and middle
of-the-road Pooulists, indignant at the
treatment of Watson, have insisted upon
maintaining their party organization in
the State as a recourse for the people
against the domination of Democratic
bosses.
The motives which determined the
votes of conservative Democrats and stal
wart Populists in Georgia and Florida will
be potent to a greater or less extent among
the same classes of voters throughout the
Union. It is not a mere coincidence that
in strong Republican States the Repub
lican vote has increased, while in strong
Democratic States tlie Democratic vote
has diminished. There must be some
widespread and strongly felt impulse to
move the voters of Vermont and Arkansas,
or Maine and Georgia, in the same way.
Nor is it difficult to determine the nature
of that impulse. It is simply the revolt of
the business instinct of the people against
Democratic free trade ana Bryanite free
silver.
If anything had been needed to give
assurance of a Republican victory the fall
ing off in the Democratic vote) in Arkan
sas, Florida and Georgia would give it. A
proportionate Democratic loss in other
States will give the entire North and West
to McKinley. Even the border State may
be counted in the Republican column.
Democracy and Populism have fused in
vain.
The first and most pressing duty of the
men responsible for the government of
this country, therefore, Is to provide
revenue sufficient for its needs. I shall
hail the opportunity to vote for that
revenue, and I believe that in raising it
we should follow out the policy which
prevailed in this country from 1861 to
1893, and which at the aamÂ« time that
it procured the necessary mean* for our
current expenditures and the payment
of 99, 000,000, 000 of debt, had the
effect of enormously increasing the
prosperity of our people.â Hon. S. W.
McCall.
HARMONY AND SUCCESS.
There is no joy among the minor politi
cians who have been supporting a few
factionista in a futile contest against legal
and rightful authority in the Republican
party of San Francisco. These blind fol
lowers of equally blind would-be bosses
present an appearance so grotesque that
their plaintive wail is productive of mer
riment rather than pity.
"Behold our ridiculous plight," quoth
they. "Behold how we stood in with
the Martin Kelly game all summer,
and now we shall hare to wear linen
dusters ail winter."
The candidates named by the Kelly
convention must certainly feel a sad
ness mingled with chagrin when they
reflect upon the position in which the
Supremo Court's action places them.
The decision that they have no legal place
on the official ballot has bereft them of
every hope for success, and well nigh
snuffs out their ambition to defeat the
regular nominees of the party to which
they have hitherto avowed allegiance.
Some of these nominees will doubtless
accept the present opportunity to retire
from a contest which must inevitably end
disastrously for them and their friends.
As for the rank and file, members of the
Republican party who have been tempo
rarily misled by specious pretensions on
the part of the before-mentioned would-be
bosses, they will quite naturally return to
the party where their sympathies and in
terests lie.
This prospect gives promise of Republi
can harmony and success on the 3d of
next month, despite the persistent efforts
on the part of a few individuals to con
tinue the contentions and schisms within
the party organization.

BRYAN AND THE FARMERS
American Economist.
The farmers of Nebraska have a little score
to settle with Hod. William Jennings Bryan,
just as the eleven thousand odd people in that
Btate have who were compelled to draw all
their saving out ol the savings banks to en
able them to exist during the hard times that
Bryan voted for when he helped pass the Gor
man-Wilson hybrid tariff.
It is this way with the Nebraska farmers.
During the long era oi Republican protection
their livestock had grown to be worth $86,
--023,803 In 1890. Then came the McKinley
tariff and it increased by $10,424,020, up to
$96,447,828 during the next three years, be
fore the country was afflicted with a Demo
cratic administration and the threat of free
trude.
Democracy meant disaster to the farmers of
Nebraska just as it did to the farmers in every
other State. After three years of Democracy
and a couple of years of the advance step to
ward free trade the value of Nebraska live
stock fell to $55,381,849 at the beginning of
3 896, a loss of $41,065,979 In three years.
Bryan may like to paste these figures In his
hat for ready reference when he talks to the
farmers around bis home:
VALUE OF NEBRASKA LIVESTOCK.
Jan. 1. Per od. Value.
1890.. Protection $86,023,808
1893.. Protection (McKin
ley) 93,447,828
McKinley protection increase. .. .810,424,020
1896.. Free trade (8ryÂ»n). 956,381,849
Bryan free-trade decrease $41,065,979
In 1890 there were 113,608 farms In Ne
braska, and every one of the owners of these
farms-has been more or less injured by the
adoption of the lree-trade policy that Bryan
voted forâ some more and some less. The
average loss to every Nebraska farm since 1893,
through the depreciation of the value Of in
livestock. lian been $361 50. With free silver
perhaps Bryan will refund this lobs that he
voted for. Then, again, perhaps he won't.
Farmers should make sure upon this point be
fore they vote for Bryan, Bryanisnf, more free
trade and still cheaper livestock.
THE PRESS FAVORABLE TO
WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
The women In the stress of the campaign
for equal suffrage are deeply grateful to the
newspapers of the State, three-fourths of
which are warmly advocating the sixth
amendment. Among several facts creditable
to the State, which the suffrage campaign has
brought to light, none are more so than the
generosity and the disinterestedness shown by
the press.
The Santa Barbara Flag gays: "One of the
arguments advanced against equal suffrage is
that women do not as a rule care to vote. On
the same line of argument women do not pine
fortij-j privilege of making beds or sweeping
or washing dishes, and yet all these unpleas
ant tasks are necessary to the welfare of 'we
men,' and so is equal suffrage. We have tried
to operate this Government for a long time
and have not succeeded very well, and It Is
time for us not only to allow the women to
help us, but to ask them to do so."
The Tulare Citizen speaking of proper quali
fications for the ballot says: "It is as fair and
reasonable that men of light complexion or
blue eyes should be disfranchised as it is to
disfranchise a person Decause of the accident
of sex, over which she had no control and for
which she Is in no way responsible. No test
other than that of the ability to exerc.se the
right of the elective franchise intelligently
should ever be applied among people laying
claim to an advanced stage of civilization.
â¢ * â¢ There is no good, intelligent reason
why woman should not exercise the privilege
on equal terms with man."
The Gilroy Gazette in commenting upon the
different amendments to be voted upon at the
ensuing election says: No. 6, if carried, will
give woman the ballot. As a citizen, tax
payer and mother she has a right to it. As an
intelligent being, fully as much interested in
good government as men, she can lay full
claim to take as sensible a part in elections as
men usually do. There is no good argument
against female suffrage, while there are hun
dreds in favor of it. Vote a great big yes for
No. 6, and when you have done so you will
simply have performed an act, but one that
will make you feel twice as manly. In time,
if you live to see the effects of 'woman as a
voter,' you will bless the day in which you
were permitted to put a great big X for amend
ment 6."
We have come across two papers that pay
their respects to the Missourian who is so
afraid of woman, the Hanlord Democrat and
the Ukiah Herald. The first says: "John At
kiuson oi' St. Louis says if California adopts
equal suffrage he will change his intention of
coming to this State. Arguments in favor of
equal suffrage multiply." The second paper
gives him good aavice, as follows : "Stay where
you are, John. California can do without you,
but without woman suffrage, neverl"
Among several papers in Humboldt County
favorable to amendment 6 we quote the words
of the editor of tae Eureka Watchman: "We
have never seen a valid, tenable reason urged
for denying equal suffrage. We look upon man
and woman at: two individuals before the law.
There can bo no just reason why the law
should give one individual a special right
or privilege over another individual. There
can be no reason why the law should place
a special bar or disability upon one indi
vidual to render such individual subject
to the unchecked power of another simply
because of ihe distinction of sex. Woman
must bear all the obligation*, pains and pen
alties that the law imposes, must pay taxes, be
imprisoned, be executed on tne gallows for
capital crime, and to deny her a voice in
making and rendering such laws inflicting
penalties and summarily dlsposin - of her
person and property can only arise from the
barbaric instincts that have not been educated
out of tne so-called civilized man ; in fact, this
indubitable evidence of a lorm'er state of bar
barity seems to cling to some men with terrible
tenacityâ a deathlike grip. In all stages of
civilization the barbaric and partially civil
ized inevitably go to the wall in a contest with
a higher civilization. The instinct that denies
tne individual woman the stxndiug before the
law that it does the individual man must just
as surely go to the wall, and the lime for this
event 1* very near at hand. The batt.e is
now onl"
We close with a good word from Hollister.
The West Coast Alliance says: "We do not re
member when we did not believe In the equal
political rights of men and women. We have
believed that the truth would come to be re
stored, and the natural rights of woman would
be conceded by those iv whose hands that
vote now rests. We know of no rule or prin
ciple which can be applied to women as an argu
ment against the franchise which does not ap
ply with equal force against men. We are glad
the question is before the peopie in the shape
of an amendment to the constitution. We are
' glad to find great papers like The Call cham
pioning the cause.
These samples of the sentiment of the press,
taken al random, do not look as if the "chiv
alry" of men will die out when woman's just
Claim to the ballot Is granted.
Elizabeth Sargent.
CAMPAIGN LITERATURE.
What the Republican National
Committee Is Doing in This
Campaign of Education*
Chicago Times-Herald.
One hundred and fifty million documents on
money, the tariff aud the other Issues of the
campaign, enough, reading matter to supply
every man, woman and child in the United
Slates with two documents each, have been
distributed by the Republican National Com
mittee from the Chicago headquarters. All of
the great printing presses in Chicago could not
print halt of them in a month. Their aggre
gate weight is 1200 tons. Sixty great freight
cars would be required to haul them from one
town to another.
These figures are sufficient to show clearly
that the present Presidential campaign is a
campaign of education as no other in the his
tory of American politics has been. The
Democrats have not distributed as much mat
ter, but they have been a. so active, and enough
has been distributed by both parties to enable
every one desirous oi knowledge to be fully
acquainted with the issues.
Inree floors of a big building on Wabash
avenue are occupied by Captain Thomas H.
McKee, the chief of the document depart
ment, who has charge of the work of distribu
tion. Under him are employed a large force
of men, whose number varies from day to day,
according to the exigencies of the situation.
Sometimes Captain McKee has had as many
as 140 men working for him, but at the pres
ent time the number has dropped to eighty
five or ninety.
These distribute the flood of campaign litera
ture with which Chairman Hauna has been
deluging the country. Over at toe Auditorium
ferry Heath, Â£. V. Smalley and the others pre
pare copy for the printers. This copy consists
of arguments oi ail sorts on the currency, the
tariff and other subjects which may be de
signed to wm votes for McKiniey. Then it is
printed. Not more than a fourth of the docu
ments are printed in Chicago. Captain Mc-
Kee says they all would have been printed
here, but the printers of the city have not been
able to handle any more oi them than a fourth,
nor could they it their presses were kept busy
from the opening until the clo&e of the cam
paign. So the documents are printed in every
part of the countryâ in New York, Philadel
phia, Washington, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and
in every big city from tne Atlantic Ocean to
the gulf. All the work is done in union offices
and every document bears the typographical
union's label.
One hundred and forty-five separate docu
ments are Issued by the literary bureau. These
cover every phase of the Republican platform.
By far the great majority are on the money
question, perhaps as much as three-fourths of
the total number. The tariff lathe subject of
the next largest number, then comes recipro
city, foreign relations, pensions and good gov
ernment, with a number of miscellaneous sub
jects, such as tne opinion of Democratic news
papers on the Chicago platform and candidates.
Besides those in English there are documents
printed in other languages. In German there
are twenty-seven documents. There are seven
in Bohemian, seven in Swedish, six In Nor
wegian, three in Finnish, nine in Italian, five
in Polish, three in Dutcb and two In Hebrew.
These documents arrive at the rate of 1,000,
--000 or more a day and are distributed just ao
they are received. They are of all sizes, from
little 2x4 inch leaflets of four pages, to the big
Republican campaign textbook, a pamphlet of
over 400 pages. The work of distributing them
begau on August 11, a weeK after the arrival
of Captain McKee in the city. He selected and
trained his staff, and "with the experience
which he gained at Washington as superinten
dent of the Congressional document-room he
has inangurated a wonderful system of distri
bution, which succeeds in handling from eight
totwentv-flve tons of matter a day In such a
way that he can tell at any time just how
many copies of each document have been dis
tributed, where they have been sent and other
de Most' of the documents are distributed
through the State committees. The field is
divided thoroughly. The township committees
send to the county committees the names ol
people to whom It mignt be well to send liter
ature These in turn send the names to tne
State committees, and the committees, as well
as tome private persons, make requisition
upon the document department Captain
McKee ships his matter to the State commit
tees and those attend to the minor distribu
tion. ______ â â
TRUTH ABOUT MONEY.
Much Mote Per Head in Gold
Countries Than in Silver
Countries.
It is "more money" the Bryanites want.
We have already shown that Bryan's policy
of free silver would at first contract the cur
rency of the United States to about oue- third
what it is at present.
Now. which nations have the most money,
those with the gold standard or those with the
silver standard?
The silverites are fond ol talking about per
capita circulation.
The per capita circulation of the world Is
about $5 15.
The per capita of the gold standard countries
is $18.
The per capita of the sliver standard coun
tries is nearly S4 30.
The gold standard countries have a per capita
of silver alone of $5 40.
The silver standard countries have a per
capita of silver o: $2 32, the rest of their small
circulation being mainly depreciated paper.
Under free coinage of gold and stiver the
United States had. a per capita circulation in
1800 of $4 99.7; iv 189G we have one of
$21 10.
The gold standard countries, with less than
one-third of the world's population, have very
nearly two-thirds of the world's currency cir
culation.
And yet Mr. Bryan would take the United
States from the gold standard and place it
upon the silver standard.
CONSEQUENCES OF ERYAN'S ELEC
TION.
Prom the forum.
If the Democratic party should be victorious
our Government would thereby announce Its
fraudulent bankruptcy. Simultaneously our
community would lose Its ability to pay taxes,
all imports suddenly ceasing. Borrow, the
Government could not, for no one
would lend; even if the administra
tion were not bound by the plat
form to issue no bonds in time of peace, it
could not raise money, for no oue would trust
it. Then all Government employes, and with
them the employe* of the Stales and the muni
cipalitiesâthe Judges, the police, the army, the
navy, the pensionersâ would have their means
of subsistence cutoff. The geueral paralysis of
business would at the same time cause the
stopping of all factories, shut down all mills,
clone all avenues of useful employment
Famine, compared with which all those of
which history has a record would appear as
plenty, would reign throughout the land.
Fathers would witness their families Buffer
ing the pangs of hunger and nowhere to look
for food. Thousands and tens of thousands
would perish in the agonies of starvation.
Desolation would spread from one end to the
other of the country. The Government could
give no succor. The paper money which it
would hurry to issue would, like the note of
any fraudulent bankrupt.be utterly worthless.
Its promise to pay would be deemed
a hollow mockery. In vain would we
look for help toward foreign na
tions. A dynamiter mutilated by his own
bomb can hardly expect sympathy. A pirate
sailing under the black flag can expect no aid.
The daystoi the Republic would not be leng'.h
ened ia this land. We cannot be an abomina
tion to the Lord and live.
APPLES FALL.
Tls evening In the country,
In the mild September hours,
And we linger In the odors
Of tea autumn fields and flowers.
The cricket and the katydid
Have brought their song and call,
And in the orchard gloaming
We may bear the apples fall.
Why do the apples fall this way?
Who knows the reason why?
Or why that meteor yonder
Leaves the urches of the sky?
aut even the little sparrow's end
Is known to the Lord of all; .
And we meditate with natnra
As we hear tlie apples fall.

is bound to be Dopuiar. The back is drawn
smooth over a fitted lining. The lining hooks
in the center front, the yoke lapping under
the goode front and hooking at the shoulder
and arm-size. The deep belt is separate, hook
ing under the left arm.
Fancy mixtures in wool develop beautifully
after this model, a plain fabric, elaborately
braided, being used for the vest front and
belt A black wool with wide, indefinite
stripes of light blue had the vest and belt of
light blue velvet heavily embroidered with
grass-green chenille.
A black end green mixture had violet cloth
braided in black for vest, revera and belt.
A fancy silk In multi colors had these parts
of yellow velvet embroidered in many colors
matching those in the silk.
A plain green zebiliine had these parts of
fancy silk in bright colors.
Another charming guwn was of black twine
cloth, which la a very large mesh of open
weaving. The lining was of two-toned silk in
light blue and a medium shade of green. The
yoke was of plain light blue silk, overlaid with
heavy black lace. The revers aod belt were of
green velvet heavily embroidered in black

CHILD-WORLD
JKe Hoosier poet's
J^leW Book
James Whitcomb J?ile\j Junes
His Lyre to the Old-Jime
JYIemories
James Whitcomb Riley's new book will be
issued simultaneously in this country and in
England to-morrow. "A Child-World" is its
title. Unlike Mr. Riley's previous books, this
volume is not a collection 01 poems but a con
tinuous narrative in verse of child-lor e, old
home delights and happenings in the early
life of the author.
The opening lines in the volume thus de
scribe the old homestead:
Set just one side tbe center of a small
But very hopeful Indiana townâ
The upper story looking squarely down
Vpon the main street and the main hig h way
From east to westâ historic In its day,
Known as the National roadâ o;d-timerÃ all
Who linger yet will happily recall
It as the scheme and handiwork as well
As property of Uncle *am, and tell
Of its Importance, "long and long afore
Railroads wnz ever dreamt of. furthermore
The reminiscent first inhabitants
Will make that old road blossom with romance
Of snowy caravans, in long; parade
Of covered vehicles, of every grade
From ox-cart of most primitive design
To Conesto/a wagon*, with their fine
I>eep-chested, aix-norsÂ« teams in heavy gear,
liighhames and chiming bellsâ to childish ears
And eye entrancing as the glittering trala
Of some sun-smitten pageant of old Spain.
Beside the wood-house, with broad branch es free,
Yet close above the roof, aa apple-tree
Known as the "Prince's Harvest"â Macrlc phrase!
That was a boy's own tree, In many ways!â
Its girth and height r eet both for the caress
Of h.s bare legs and his ambitiousness;
And then Its apples, humoring his whim
Seemed just to fairly hurry ripe for himâ
Even In June impetuous as he,
They drooped to meet htm, half-way up tbe tree.
And, O, their bruised sweet faces, where they
fell !â
And ho! the lips that feigned to "kiss them well!"
Mr. Riley since he became renowned bought
back this house from the strangers into whose
FRONTISPIECE OF "A CHILD- WORLD."
hands it had passed, and the improvements
made by them have taken from it much of its
early quaint appearance. It has been remod
eled, but not restoredâ only as the artist has
restored It in the frontispiece. Not a great
distance away is the "Old Swimmin' Hole"
and other scenes almost as familiar to the
reading public an to the poet himself. At this
old homestead Mr. Riley introduces the reader
to "A Child-World" and the deliciousnessof
Tbe liquid, dripping song* of orchard birdsâ
The wee bass of tje beesâ
With lucent deeps of silence afterwards;
The gay, clandestine whisperings of the breeze
And glad leaves of the trees.
Before the poet makes you acquainted with
those around him in his childhood he leads
you about the premises and points out cher
ished spots: The old woodhouse with Its old
workbench and tools, "The children's vain
possession by pretense." And then you ac
company him to the stable-yard and enjoy
with him the striking humor In the gambols
of a colt:
Home In his stall "Old Sorrel" mnnched his bay
And oats and ccrn, and switched the flies away,
In a repose of patience good to see,
An earnest of the gentlest pedigree.
With haif pa; ln- tic eye sometimes he gazed
Vpon tbe gambols of a colt that grazed
A.ound tbe edges of tbe lot outside
And kicked at nothing suddenly, and tried
To act grown-up and graceful and high-bred,
Bat dropped k'whop! and scraped the buggy-shed,
Leaving a tuft of woolly, foxy hair
Under the sharp end of a gate-hinge there.
Then, an ignobly scrambling 10 his feet,
And wblnneyin< a wblnney like a bleat,
He would oursue himself around the lot
Andâ do the whole thing over, like as not!
The old-home life and "the five happy little
Hoosier chaps inhabiting this wee world" are
delightful child studies. Riley's description
of them displays more than ever his rare
insight into the habits and minds of children.
At times in his previous verse he seems to
have reached the acme of tender affection,
touching exquisitely on the love of mother
and child, for instance. But it is not recalled
that he has ever before brought the mother
Into a noem in such sweet fashion as in this
chain of childhood stories:
Bhrined in her sanctity of home and lor*,
And love's fond service and reward thereof,
Restore her thus, O blessed memory-
Throned in her rocking-chair, and on her knee
Her sewingâ her work-basket on the floor
Beside her; springtime through the open door
â¢ Balmily stealing In ana all about
ThÂ« room; ihe bees' dim hum and the far shout
And laughter of the children at their play,
And neighbor children from across the way
i Calling in gleeful challenge â save alone
| One boy whose voice sends back no answering
toneâ
The boy, prone on the floor, above a book
Of pictures, with a rapt, ecstatic 100k â
Even as the mother's, by the selfsame spell,
Is lifted, with alight ineffableâ
As though her senses caught no moral cry,
But beard, instead, some poem going by.
What could be more realistic and natural
than his lines on the sounds in the home on a
summer day:
Blent with all outer sounds, the sounds withinâ
In mild remoteness falls the household din
Of porch and kitchen : the dull jar and thump
Of churning; and the "glung-glung" of the pump,
With sudden pad and scurry of bare feet
Of little outlaws, in from field or street:
The clan? of ket leâ r â¢sd of damper-rln?
And bang of cooks ove doorâ ana everything
That jingles in a busy kitchen lifts
Its individual wrangling voice and drifts
In sweetest tinny, coppery, pewtery tone
Of music hungry ear has ever known
In wildest famished yearning and conceit
THRONED IX HER P.OCKINQCHAIH.
Of youth, to just cut loose and eat and eat I
The swooning-sweet aroma haunting all
The houseâ upstairs and down-porch, parlor, hall
And sitting-roomâ lnvadlne even where
The Hired Man sniffs injthe or.-hard air
And pauses in his pruning of the trees
To note the sun minutely and toâ sneeze.
A happy portrayal in tbe new book is that of
| Noey Bixler, one of those lads who can do just
j anything possible for a boy to do, doing all
! those things which make a boy overwhelm
i ingly popular with his companions. This
| awkward, overgrown youngster is primarily an
j artisan, a manufacturer of toy-wagons, bows
i and arrows, stilts and the like, with which he
I delights his little friends. The mysteries oi
the woods and the depths of the creeks are
no mysteries at all to him. He is a wonderful
lad, knowing so much and doing ?o much, and
yet destitute as to any musical tnste â he can
only "whistle bass." Jlr. Riley evidently ap
preciates the boyhood law of compensation.
Who ever knew a lad, otherwise giited, that
could whistle well? Noey Bixler's pucker
music is regarded as " phenomenally un
meiodious" by Cousin Rufus, who knew notes,
while Uncle Mart vouchsafed that:
Noey conidn't whistle 'Bonny Doon,"
Even; and. he'd bet, couldn't carry a tune
If it had bandies to it!
The Creative hand of Noey at last brings him
great measure of fame; his masterpiece in
snow is praised in song, the apprentice poet of
the town honoring the work with a "pane
gyric scroll of rhyme." It was an artist indeed
that painted grapes so natural the birds
pecked at them, but what are the critics to say
of the boy who makes a snow man "so fierce
and sassy" that the children haa to"eitust
to him" before they ceased to be afraid? In
the frosty s tudio of the dooryard this work of
sculptured snow evolves itself faster than any
s<x>ne ever chased by Grecian chisel, yet the
processes are none the less fascinating because
they merely produce a snow manâ finished off
with eyes made of walnuts and whiskers
wrought of buggy cushion stuffin'.

While any day that gave the children Noey
was notable and dear, tbe narrative records
his advent one day whtn the two little boys,

A CONSPIRACY OF THE CARBON* ART. By
Louise Muhlbach. New York: F. Tennyson
Neely, publisher. For sale by Emporium Book
Department; cloth, price ?5 cents.
After the first dimming of Napoleon's star at
Aspern, May 22, 1809, the leading members of
the Society of the Carbonari, generals and sol
diers who stood close to the Emperor and some
of whom attended his .councils, resolved to
free France from a csesarism that had bien
forced upon her and to effect the removal from
the world of the man whom they denounced in
secret as the "scourge o% their native land."
After the lost battle of Aspern, Napoleon slept
for twenty-two hours in the very midst of the
conspirators, who during that time were en
gaged in discussing the question of the Em
peror's successor. Their opportunity to carry
out their designs thus passed, and Napoleon's
star was soon in the ascendant again at Wa
grnm. Again the Carbonari planned the Em
peror's destruction. It seemed that their plot
could not fail. Just as the blow is about to be
struck, the conspirators are unmaskea and dis
armed, and .some of them sent to the execu
tioner. Napoleon knew everything. Themis
tress of one of the conspirators turns out to
have been a spy In the pay of the Emperor.
She receives half a million francs for the in
formation concerning the intended killing of
Bonaparte, but offers back tbe fortune to save i
the man among the Carbonari whom she love d
For her sake the lover's liie is spared. Leo
nore, the spy, becomes his wife and goes to
abide with him in prison , within the walls of
which she dies, while the husband is not re
leased until long after Waterloo. The story
has some historical foundation. It contains
some strong scenes and some highly dramatic
passages. The translator is Mary J. Saflord.
THE SUN'S GIFT TO EARTH.
WHAT IS ELECTRICITY? By John Trow
bridge, S.D. New YorK: D. Appleton <ft (Jo.,
publishers. For sale by William Doxey: cloth,
price $1 60.
This is another valuable contribution to the
International Scientific series. The author is
a lecturer on the applications of science to the
useful arts at Harvard University. In the
book before us, containing over 300 pages, he
seeks to give the general reader an idea of the
present direction of investigation in the sci
ence of electricity. In his preface tbe author
states that, being often asked the question,
"What is electricity?" he has endeavored in
this volume to give in a popular manner the
views up to date of scientific men in regard to
the matter. "According to modern ideas the
continuance of all life on earth is due to the
electrical energy which we receive from the
sun; and physics in general can be defined as
that subject which treats of the transforma.
tions of energy. I have therefore prese nted
the varied phenomena of electricity in such a
manner that the reader can perceive the
physicist's reasons for supposing that all space
is filled with a medium which transmits elec
tro-magnetic waves to us irom the sun."
AN AUTHOR'S LITTLE PLAYMATE
\V. V. HEF. BOOK and Various Verses. By Wil
liam Canton. New York: Stone & Kiniball,
publishers-
There is much pleasure for old as well as
young in the perusal of "W. V. Her Book."
The reader cannot help falling in love with
the commonplace little body in whose society
the author revels: "for. after all, she is merely
the average healthy, merry, teasing, delightful
mite who tries to take the whole of life at once
into her two diminutive hands." She wants
to know all about everything that her happy,
eager eyes lipht upon, and expresses her glee
and wonderment, as new objects meet her
view, in quaint and pretty terms of phrase.
After following this child through her ram
bles find play, and listening to her innocent
speculations, to the words she freely coins and
to the quotations she has equipped herself
with, one may appreciate the author's sym
pathy for less favored mortals: "Oh, you who
1 are saa at heart, or weary of thought, or irri
table with physical pain, conx, beg, borrow or
steal a four or five year old, and betake you to
blowing bubbles in the sunshine of your re
clusegarden." The verse of "Her Book" em
braces some sweet fancies. In addition to the
songs of childhood's fairyland, there are
verses (some of them very clever) covering a
variety of themes.
AN EXCELLENT BOOK.
SWEETHEART TRAVELERS. By & R.
Crockett. New York and London: F. A. stokes
Company, pubJl^iers. For sale by William
Do.xt-y; cloth, prlcÂ« $1 75.
This is a child's book for children, for women
Â»nd ior men, as Mr. Crockett tells us in his
own happy way. The modesty of the author
of "The Stickit Minister" leads him to under
value his own merits, when, for instance, he de
clares that he "cannot give these vagrom
chronicles their right daintiness." We do not
have to go very far into the book before we are
made positive that he has done that very
thing. The chronicles are "full of the glint of
spring flowers when they are wet and the sun
shinea slantways upon them; full of freshen
ing winds and withdrawing clouds, and above
all, the unbound gladness of children's
laughter." The book should be well patron
ized coming on the Cnristmastide. Pome of
the papers first appeared in fugitive form
several years ago, and the author was induced
to put them together in one volume by those
elders who bad "never quite been able to put
away childish things." "Sweetheart Travelers"
are father and little daughter, and they go
hand in hand through a wodd of golden de
lights, and their story is told inimitably well

read it; so will an elder person. It is pure and
elevating; there is something good in every
line of it. and its charm holds from beginning
to end. Besides being handsomely printed on

ROMANCE OF
AN OLD WORLD
James GoWarv's JaJe
About Mars
Jhe Story of an English Miller and
Some Glassic Myths of
DAYBREAKâ A .Romance of an Old World. By
J.. mi's Cowan. New York: George N. Ricu
moud <fe Co., publishers.
Considering the recent successes of Alvan
Clark & Sons in casting larger object-glasses
than was once thought possible, and their
assertion that they can place no limit to the
size these glasses may attain In the future, the
author wonders if it is presumption to believe
tnat "the day will dawn when this world will
know whether Mars or Venus is inhabited."
We are taken on a balloon trio to Mars, where
a race of people is found In a far more ad
vanced state of civilization and society than
is the case on our terrestrial planet. One
of the pleasant peculiarities of the Martian
character is an entire absence of dis
agreeable curiosity. The Martian race is
highly developed physically, mentally, spirit
ually, and the reader learns how the
high standard was reached through
the application of wisdom to the lessons of ex
perience. It Is learned that Mars has, far
back In its history, suffered from the same in
dustrial, political and social troubles that now
are felt upon the earth; but Mars has over
come all these difficulties, a settlement being
reached by the people turning over all busi
ness, industrial and professional, to the gov
ernment, soing Mr. Bellamy several points
better. The author believes in thehabitabil
ity of other worlds, and this volume hints at a
possible solution of the question of whether
the earth alone, among all the planets of the
heavens, was chosen by God for the peculiar
honor read of in the gospel story. The visitors
from the earth iearn that Mars has a history
of a savior quite like the Christ of our own
planet. Simply to suit the purposes of his
story the author has made the analogy be
tween the earth and Mars quite close, such
analogy, however, not being a matter of his
belief. The situations are exaggerated to re
lieve the book of dullness.

miller of the parish, crossed in love, becomes
furious in his rage on the day when his suc
cessful rival, the gamekeeper, weds the village
smithy's daughter. He is attacked by brain
fever, and the kind nurse who attends him
with all the care of a mother for her babe
learns to love him for virtues that outweighs
his faults. On his recovery he one day shoots
a fox that has ravaged his henroosts, and upon
being berated by the gamekeeper for the of

CELTIC LEGENDS.
THE WASHER OF THE FOHD. By Fiona
JMadeod. New York: Stone & Kimball, pub
lisbers; cloth, price ? 1 25.
The legendary moralities and barbaric talcs
presented in this volume will command atten
tion, not only because they are worthy of it in
a literary sense, but because the author has
endeavored to illustrate what has been for
hundreds of years a characteristic of the
purely Celtic mindâ an apparent complexity
arising from the grafting of Christianity on
paganism. It is held that to this day there
are Christian rites and superstitions which are
merely a gloss upon a surviving antique pa
ganism. The titular piece is the keynote of
the book as well as the before-mentioned char
acteristic of the Celt. In the passage of pa
ganism the old myths were too deep-rooted in
the Celtic mind to vanish at the bidding of the
cross. "The Washer of the Ford," as the au
thor remarks, might well have appeared to a
single generationâ now as a terrible and som
ber pagan goddess of death ; now as a symbolic
figure in the new faith, foreshadowing spirit
ual salvation and the mystery of the resurrec
tion. There are fifteen legends in the book and
every one of them is rich with Imagery and
with the natural poetry in which Celtic tradi
tion abounds.

In order that Arthur Morrison's new book,
"A Child of the Jago," may be issued this
autumn a new plan for its serial publication
has been adopted. The first thirteen chapters
will appear in the New Review. The re
mainder of the book will be given to the pub
lic for the first time when the story appears in
book form. Mr. Morrison is known as tbe
author of "Tales of Mean Streets," which crit
ics everywhere acknowledged as the most pow
erful stories of slum life written in recent
years. The new novel Is In character like his
former success, but is the result of more care
ful work. The author thinks it the best writ
ing he has ever done. The American publish
ers are Herbert S. Stone & Co., Chicago.
On the first of June there were In existence
in Paris 2291 periodicals of all kinds, classified
as follows: Eight hundred monthlies, 669
weeklies, 137 dailies, 237 with no fixed date
of publication. The others are semi-weekly,
etc. France as a whole, including the colo
nies, issues 3566 periodicals, of which 336 are
dailies.
"Genius and Degeneration," by Dr. William
Hirsch, is the title of an important work
which will be published immediately by D.
Appleton & Co. Dr. Hlrsch's acute and sug
gestive study of modern tendencies was begun
before "Degeneration" was published, with
the purpose of presenting entirely opposite
deductions and conclusions. The appearance
of Dr. Nordau's famous book, with its criti
cisms upou Dr. Hirsch's position, enabled the
latter to extend the scope of his work, which
becomes a scientiflc answer to Dr. Nordau, al

Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. announce for
early publication the first volume of the great
historical work which has occupied the ener
gies of Edward Eggleston for the greater part
of the last sixteen years. The general title is
"A History of Life in the United States,"
the first volumeâ "The Beginners of a Na
tion"âdealing with the causes and motives of
the seventeenth century migrations.
The October Philistine haa a prose sketch
by Stephen Crane, wherein is told how a cer

wearing a greasy dress "marked with many

and steals a toy wagon from a baby in frills.
It was a great time! William Mclntosh has a
pithy argument on "The Literary Sweatshop."
Charles G. D. Roberts has a fine poem pleading
for light and good nature. But the "Side
Talks" are the best the magazine has had for
months. They occupy sixteen pages and make
up just half of the booklet. They are very
full of pepper sauce.
On the completion of the compositors' work
at the printers' of lan Maclaren's new book,
"Kate Carnegie and Some Ministers," the
author wrote in the following terms to the
manager of the office: "As this (batch of
proofs returned) completes the tale, would
you kindly convey to the compositors my sin-
Cere appreciation of their skill? Would you
also distribute the inclosed trifle among the
men who ao my work, that they may smoke a
pipe extra to soothe their nerves after de
ciphering my handwriting?"
The volume of collected sketches by Archi
bald Forbes, to be issued soon by Messrs. Mac
milian, will be called "Camps, Quarters and
Casual Piaces." It consists of papers which
have already appeared in the magazines, and
which, to judge from the success that has at
tended similar previous volumes by the same
author, are likely to find many readers in a
more permanent form.
Norway has abolished the study of Greek
ana Latin in her public high schools, which
means the total abolition of classical educa

A new translation of Shakespeare into
French by M. Jules Lermina, with illustra
tions by Robida, is shortly to be published in
Paris. It will be extremely literal, the trans
lator's intention being to enable his readers to
read Shakespeare as he wrote it, through the
medium of another language. "Hamlet" and
"Romeo and Juliet" will be published this

This talented author has given us a charm
ing book in her fantasia, "The Herb-Moon."
Rose Arden's life, with its cloud of sorrow
that the sun of happiness is destined to dis
pel; that life and its woes that came to her
with an early marriage, which was soon to be
cheated of its illusion by a husband's cruelty
and to be followed by a dreadful occurrence
that would remove him from the path of her
years; then the life of quiet days, sewing and
helping others; the new love that crept into
her heart, nestled and staid there In silence;
the new love that she sought in vain to bury
forever; the long-time love, too, that the
country folk were wont to jest about, ap
peals strongly to the reader's sympathy and
admiration; while in Robsart's career the
warmest interest is arousedâ Robsart, the
hero, who redeems his family name,
wins distinction on the battlefield
and in Parliament, and, despite op
portunities to marry youth, beauty ana
riches at the height of his fame, turns to Rose,
the true woman, and lifts her up beside him to
De his wife, envied of those who dreamed that
he would choose for a bride none other than
"a brilliant-looking woman with a presence."
The story is full of good, healthful morals.
One even wishes it were longer. And, as to
the meaning of the herb-moon, it is explained
by Susan, the housekeeper, early in the book,
when, referring to Mr. Robsart, she remarks:
"When he marries I hope it will be straight off,
without shilly-shally. For there's nothing so
wearing as the herb-moon."
"The herb-moon?" repeated Rose, stupefied.
"Aye I that'b my name for one of those long
courtships. Adam and I did all our courting In a
fortnight. That's why we are happy. This walk-
Ing out with each other year In and year out till
your nerve is gone and you are slctt with talking
was never to my taste, nor to my mother's before
me. 'Tisn't natural, and I'm all for nature, I am."
But the herb-moon only served to make
stronger and deeper and higher the love that
finally crowned the lives of Robsart and Rose
Arden. The story is told in simple and beau
tiful style.
A VOLUME_OF ESSAYS.
WITH MT NEIGHBORS. By Margaret E.
BanÃSter. New York: Harper <fc Bros., publish
ers. For sale by A. M. Robertson, San Fran
cisco; price $1 25.
The articles which form this volume were
originally published either in the Congrega
tionalist or the Christian Intelligencer. They
consist of short essays on homely topics relat
ing to everyday life, and the lessons sought to
be conveyed are oiten illustrated by some
pithy anecdote. In addition to the "talks"
as the author calls these little essays, she has
reprintedâ by requestâ some of her poems.
Among the most characteristic of these talks
are "Tuckered Out, "in which there is a pro
test against the incessant drive of people who
are too busy; "Mother-brooding," tbe ability
mothers have of seeing when a daughter is un
happy and of silently comforting her; "So
ciety Girls," in which there is a strong plea for
the real usefulness of those who are supposed
to be devoted to fashion; "A Child's Savings
Bank," warning parents of the danger of arous
ing the spirit of cupidity ; three papers on the
relation of mistress and maid, a topic always
timely and interesting in American homes,
and "The Care of the Care-Taker," a strong
plea for those who care for Invalids.
The Rev. John Watson (lan Maolaren) will
sail on the Germanic on September 18, to
begin his American lecture tour. Dr. Watson
is booked for fifty- four lectures in this country.
Marion Crawford has written a new story es
pecially for The Century. It is called "A Rose
of Yesterday," and it will begin in the Novem
ber number and run for six months. The story
opens in Lucerne, and while it is entirely sep
arate in interest some of the personages that
appear in it will be familiar to readers of "Don
Orsino." It is wholly romantic in character.
Mr. Astor's magazine, the Pall Mall, will
shortly publish verses by an American poet,
George Edgar Montgomery, on two British
themes, "England" and "Queen Victoria."
Mr. Montgomery, by the way, is writing a
series of New York poems for Harper's Weekly.
A few of these have been published. Others to
follow immediately are "Fire Island" and
"Fifth Avenue." These verses will be col
lected later in a book. They are in a vein of
serious poetry, yet realistic.
Among the subjects for essays which the
University of Berlin offers prizes for the season
of 1896-97 is: "Robert Burns, the hundredth
anniversary of whose death has just been cele
brated, was, notwithstanding his great origi
nality, influenced in a variety of ways, aa
regards both the form and contents of his
poems, especially by the popular lyrics of his
home and Scotch imitators of them, like Ram
say and Ferguson, but also by Pope, Young,
Goldsmith, Ossian, etc. The writer of the dis
sertation is expected to trace these influences
to their source and describe them chronologi
cally, emphasizing everywhere the additions
made by Burns himself."
The fact tbat the first edition of "The Grey
Man." amounting to no fewer than 35,000
copies, has been subscribed before the novel is
published, shows that S. R. Crockett's popu
larity is still in tbe ascendant. Very seldom
indeed is so large a first edition printed.
Howard Pease, who has been termed by Lon
don critics the "Northumbrian Kipling," has
just completed a volume of stories called "The
White-Faced Priest."

Fitzgerald, entitled "The Zankiwank and ihÂ«
Bletherwitch," will be issued shortly.

J\ Dipeetoipe Costume and a Visiting Toilette
The Directoire costume is an excellent
model carried out in hopsack. The"skirt
is the new shape, with but little fullness
at the back of the waist. The fastening of
the bodice from the right shoulder is j
necessary, one revers edged with the same
embroidered braid which appears in the ,
skirt. Two large and handsome mosaic
buttons look well. A deep belt and a
small basque "eased" on to the edge of
the bodice complete it, and the sleeves i
should be less bouffant than those illus
trated. They are finished with epaulettes. '
Everybody Can Have a Tailors Made Costume
Those who have but a limited allowance
on which to dress should remember tiiat a
tailor suit is not an impossihty, for the
skirt can be made at home and by having
it pressed by a tailor the result should be
good, but they muat give the jacket to a
first-class man, and if the cloth is properly
sponged there is no reason why a stylish
gown should not be evolved.
For reception and house gowns the
princess are' among the most fashionable

puffs. A smart cravat of creamy lace has
stiff long ends, and above the stock of
black satin the lace again is visible. The

THE WAR OF THE MILLINER AND THE MANAGER
THE DETACHABLE HAT THAT MAY SOLVE A VEXED PROBLEM.
The new woman has met her Waterloo
and has been conquered again by the ty
rant man. He used to take off his hat to
her. Now be merely points to it, but he
insists that she shall remove hers out of
respect to him. These be wonderful days,
when women take off their hats to the
gentlemen !
In restaurants there are nice little signs
telling gentlemen to remove their hats.
There are many more which would look
as well. They might request gentlemen
pot to put their feet on the table or mildly
tbem not to pour soup into their
hats. Soon there will be companion mot
toes setting forth that ladies, too, must
doff their bonnets. Why, yes, don't you
know, the theaters send round pleasant
little hints now. The fiat has gone forth
and the big picture-hot is doomed.
That is in theory. Pretty things die
hard. And this hat question gets quite
complicated when you unfold it and
spread it out. We will admit it is a case
of selfishness on both sides. The manager
needn't try to pose as a philanthropist, for
the ladies won't let him. They remember
how he smiled at skyscrapers and thought
them lovely until inconsiderate people be
gan to bother him, just because they
couldn't see. The idea! Some folks never
are satisfied! Why don't all those people
who can't see over the hats take front
seats? Do they want the ladies to look
lew lovely to oblige them ? Some women,

The milliners have various ideas on the
subject. There is one on Kearny street
who fears the big hat is doomed in San

The wind prevents them from being very
popular for street wear. She says the
effect will be felt clear down on the os

their tails (have ostriches tails?) at half
mast, in mourning for their lost glory.
Does the manager realize the breadth oi
his path of destruction ?
Will he wantonly wound the tender
feelings of those noble birds and drive
them to a diet of hatpins and death? if
the wide brims are to go where can the
feathers be piled on ? And if there is to be

is a white brocaded pattern in velours

paillettes "shaped like the minute petals

be used for dress fronts and court trains.
A similar silk has a white silk brocade and
no velvet, the chine flowers being large
from one of the wonderful paintings of
long ago. But, no, there is no tims for
sentimentality! so to return to practical
affairs. All the latest evening gowns are

A pretty young milliner on Market
street just laughs and goes on piling
plumes on a drum-major bat. She says
the theaters can't do a thing but grumble,
and women will wear what they please.
All the hats are large this season, she
says, and she hands out great masses of
velvet and ribbons and feathers and puts
on hat after hat to shovr how a large one
sets off a round face. She is a picture in
a frame of deep velvet with feathers curling
all round. The plumes curl like Medusa
snakes as she nods emphatically and tells
hqw few women are charming in small
hats. There is nothing, she insists, more
magical than a big bat and no place where
it is so effective as in the soft light of a
theater. She says "Oh, pshaw I" when
told what the other milliner feared, and
she will not pity the ostriches at all, ber
cause women will never be silly enough to
put their heads in the sand or their lights

An effort was made the other day to
find a compromise hat, which might
be pretty and yet allow some of
the landscape to appear around the
corners. It was no easy job. In
fact, it was given up. If there was
very logical conclnsion, but it has taken a
great many years to arrive at it.

the same obstructionist, and when the
feathers were put straight up to be oui, of
the way the ladies were horrified, and
somehow it didn't look just right. It is a
bonnet or a bare head, or else it is a big
hat. There is no compromise.
Right here the woman with a cameo
facs, who can wear one rose and a bit of
lace for a bonnet, may have a few mo-
Aents to give thanks. She is' not in this
pickle at all.
"Oh, yes," complained one society girl,
"it is all very fine if one has a small face
to go with a small hat, or a lot of hair to
look nice without one, but just see here,
I can't wear anything smaller than this,
and I'll stay home before I'll go liKe a

There is a fortune in store for the inven
tor of a transformation hat. Something
like those cakepans which come to pieces,
you know. It must be a wide one with
a great curling brim and feathers like
tropical undergrowth. The lady will come
into the theater, a vision, a Doem, a pas
tel, and when the curtain goes up she will
touch a spring and presto!â off will come
the brim and the feathers and the lady
will have on a tiny capote. Won't that be
lovely ! And then the horrid people who
grumble will have nothing to say.
Since it seems to be the opinion of the
majority that the big hat must, not be
worn during the play, and still the ladies
will not discard the wide brim, the burden
is shifted to the shoulders of the man
agers.
When she takes off her $50 hat, what are
you going to do with it, Mr. Manager? Is
she to stuff it unaer the chair? It will
not go. Besides she would rather sit
under the chair herself and give the seat

her heart is the hat with the feathers.

chairâ no, some confounded growler would

This is the place for an interlude. This

their hats, but between acts they rush out
for cloves. Women sit quietly through

little idiosyncrasies, one to offset the
other, and one would think to find a mu
tual forbearance. But you do not. Men
grumble. Women knowhow precious the

Quite fetching is a theater bodice of
their dainty skirts are scraped by many
feet scrambling for the aisle in a hurry
for fear the clove may become weary and
go home.
Beware! Each smiling woman will be
come as a lioness defending her young
when a man scrambles over her hat. It
will never do, Mr. Manager. Could you
even things by sending around a second
little notice requesting the gentlemen to
bring the clove with them ! Ah, nol You
would not wish to throw the whole cosmos
out of joint. Men must go out for a clove.
They have done it from beginning of time
and their rights must be respected. How
about the right to wear n â well never
mind, Mr. Manager, but you've got to find
some place for those big hats. It must
be a safe place, too, where they will
not be crushed. You have a heavy re
sponsibility there. Think of 600 bats,
each covering an area of three square
feet. You must build a hatroom and
check the things. Nor is that all. These
GOO women are not going to elbow and
crowd and wait to claim their head gear.
You must provide dainty maidens â many
of themâ to pass the hats during the last
act, and you must evolve a system by
which every hat gets to its fair owner and
to no other person.
This may seem a deal of bother in order
that some people may see what they have
paid to see, but you'll have the conscious
ness of victory and you'll be happy, per
haps, in spite of all the sorrowful birds
nnd the disconsolate silkworms you have
thrown out of a job.
There's one woman who doesn't care
whether styles change or not, and to
whom the manager's wishes are but wind.
She is the tailor-made girl, who wears a
round hat over smooth, sbinmg, parted
hair which never seems mussed. She
goes to the theater to see the play, and
she never notices whether or not there are
eyes on her hat. If said hat bothers a
man he has only to say so, and the hat is
under the chair. Siie's a queer girl.
She thinks all of us go there
to watch the stage. Wnen the
wrongs of the sex are laid before her she
opens her eyes and says â she's horridly
blunt: "Well, one woman pays for one
seat, doesn't she? She has no right to a
whole row." It is explained to this im
possible young person how much more
becoming a large hat is and what a pic
ture it makes, but she only says: "Oh,
well, if you are on exhibition â but then
you would better nire a hall."
It is not necessary to talk further with
this person. She has no sense of the beau
black mousseline de soie. embroidered
with fleur de lis, in a shade of yellow over
one of the new phades of green silk,
trimmed with frills of black mousseline
de soie, which partially veils the deep
empire waistband of green silk. An effort
is being m^'le to render the backs of the
bodices as pretty and fully trimmed as
the fronts, and it is meeting with great
success.
Miroir velvet printed in white, as though
the color had been expunged, is lovely
in the deep light pinKS, and there is
a liberal range of light striped and dark
striped velvets of two shades watered on
tiful. She doesn't think women were
made, like the flowers of the conservatory,
to be beautiful, and to be gazed on for
their beauty. Perhaps she works. Maybe
she reads like a man. Anyway she says
she's no butterfly, and no wax doll, and
while she thinks the pattern hats are
pretty things, you couldn't hire v her to
carry one around on her head.
So, you see her opinion isn't worth hav
ing.
She has nosvmpathy for the aown-trod
den ostrich, and no feeling for the pov
erty-stricken silkworm. She has even
been suspected of an idea that women
could do without hats and men without
cloves. Pass her by.
Brave indeed is the manager to face the
prospect of souls lost through envy; of
the hatred of women; of the sorrows of
Dirds and worms; of the care of priceless
headgear, and the lasting enmity of the
whole race of milliners.
In yielding thus in one instance the
feminine portion of the community has
done for itself. It will soon be restricted
to one seat per head in a car and one-half
the sidewalk. It will be expected to know
what it wants in a store and to get off a
car face forward. The only revenge pos
sible is to contract the habit of going out
for a clove and stepping on as many toes
as possible. Grace Allen.

Smart men are carefully avoiding bright
blues, greens and reds just now. They
were worn only lor a very short time last
winter by correctly garbed man, and this
winter sober hues will prevail. A few men
in Newport have witrtin the past few
weeks blossomed out in a sort of pea
jacket, or a species of reefer or double
breasted sack of blue. However, it is not
yet possible to say whether it will obtain
this winter. "Him" writes:
I also see that the desire for mufti continues
to such an extent that the lounge coat is be
coming vastly popular in England, and a com
promise is being effected by the introduction
of jackets with the lower corners cut square.
It seems also that in some quarters pumps
have been superseded for evening wear by
low patent-leather shoes. Russet boots, laced,
have also given way to russet boots, buttoned!
and tall hats nave been introduced much
higher and a great deal more belled in the
crown. All these innovations have not
reached us. A very excellent hint given is
that all white waistcoats are not starched,
only ironed. There is a prophecy that the
club tie will be aDandoned this season, but I
fear that the prophet will have miscalculated
his facts. I, for one, would be sorry to see it
go, although in winter I believe that for
afternoon wear the Ascot or the four-in-hand is
decidedly smarter, unless you cling to the all
around turndown collarâ a bit of neckwear
j which, in my opinion, belongs entirely to mufti.
"Quite absurd is it for men to affect
colored or tinted note paper," declares an
Eastern authority. ''They should use
only the very best quality of Irish linen,
and those possessing a crest and mott
should have it on their paper, but not
their coat-of-arms."
A properly cut and mounted seal ring is
appropriate for a man, but not so are dia
mond, turquoise, etc., rings.
Quite a novelty is the new "Golf" cigar
lighter, consisting of a solid silver golf
ball mounted on an ebony stand. It will
be highly appreciated by smokers, C. C.

coasts and blouses. Those with a design
of tiny flowers all over them are espe
cially attractive. Again black stripes :ire
noted on white grounds, and black satin
stripes on moires, many of which are
watered after the semblance of cork,
others like a stalactite, while others ap

The stripes may be had in all widths, and
colored "saun stripes appear alike on black
and white silks. Black is again to be very
fashionable, but white is preferred for
evening gowns, and numberless beautiful
brocades have been placed on tbe market.

/ The wild ducks on the marshes in differ
/ ent parts of the State have only a few days
' more to fly about at their owu sweet wills,
for on next Thursday the shooting season
opens â that is, for sportsmen. The mar
ket hunters will hr.ye to wait another
month, and so will all people with duck
appetites who are not hunters and have
no friends who kill duck and are willing
to send them a few.
All through the valleys of the interior
and the marshes along the bay shore
preparations are going on to give the
ducks a warm reception. Early Thursday
morning shotguns will commence to
"bang" and the ducks to fall. The bang
ing will be kept up as long as there is a
duck in sight, and when night falls there
is likely to be a big decrease in the duck
census.
There is also likely to be sport of an
other kind. It will all be the result of the
old feud between the sportsmen who think
it their right to hunt wherever they can
find ducks and the men who Jease a por
tion of land and "preserve" the game on
it- Both are right according to their own
ways of reasoning and non-shooters can
only hope the others will not use their
shotguns on one another.
There is a possibility, though, that the
peace will not be kept, for both sides are
determined. As if to "baard the lion in his
den" a big ark has been towed from Ala
meda to the Suisun marshes, and all sports
men are invited to come and have a day's
shootniL'. It is said there will be arrests
and lawsuits and an awful lot of trouble,
but ail of which will in no way interfere
vritn the sportsmen who go only to places
where they are welcome. And there are
plenty of such places not far from San
_, Francisco where good sport can be had
' without the danger of unpleasantness. It
is true that many sportsmen thinfc it their
duty to upho:d their rights and will go to
the place of troubie. They are fighting for
a principle, and according to history j
they should come out victorious. Men
feel the same whether they are battling
for ducks or battling for a nation.

DUCK HUNTER'S VILLAGE ON ALVTSO MARSH, WHERE ALL IS IN READINESS FOR THE OPEN SEASON.
Women Witfe Scattered Serves and tfye ...Medicine Jiabit
Scarcely a paper appears without the
Btory of a suicide or some insane act of a
nervous woman. They seek the unknown
â side of death, or send another to find it,
for reasons too trivial to notice. Someone
loves a man too well, another not
enough ; a parent has spoken harshly to a
daughter, or a daughter has failed in her
duty to her parent; something has hap
pened or something has not. The only
remedy is suicide or the murder of an
other. There must be a desperate condi
t on of mind when a woman deliberately
sends her soul from her body, or else there
is a diseased condition of the nerve?, and
from the causes alleged the latter seems
true more often than the former. It has
fcee:i gravely advanced that girls all have
this desire ior self-destruction; that it is
born with them and stays with them until
the age of twenty-live. Why twenty-five?
And why are girls born so more than
boys? It is all moonshine. A healthy J
girl never has any idea of leaving this
world until she must. Sometimes it is
nerves, sometimes liver, and oflener than
either the lack of wholesome work.
There was a girl effected with melan
cholia who was miserable herself, from no
earthly reason, and who made every one
about her miserable. A fond father took
her to Europe, brought about her all the
reople of culture and strove in every way
to lift her mind from its slough of de
spond, without avail. It may be cruel,
but I never thought of her or saw her
â¢without wishing to take her away from
her leisure, her beautiful home, and her
kind parents, and put her where she
must labor for her daily bread, and help
some one else who had none. Work, an j
object in life, and wholesome self-sacrifice
would soon have driven away the mel
ancholia.
Presh air and exercise are wonderful
cures for low spirits. In fact I feel sore
that half the biues, despondency and
thoughts of death are caused by lifeless
air, sluggish liver and laziness. Women
are not as a rule victims of the liquor
habit, but they have some little habits of
their own which work sad havoc with
nerves and their bodies generally. The
very worst one is the medicine habit.
How many women of your acquaintance,
when they feel ill, look at their own
habits and food to see what they have or
have not done to upset nature? Do they
not, all of them, fly to a medicine bottle,
and that without, knowing whether the
medicine is good for them or not? Find
me a woman who does not dose herself
promiscuously and I will show you a
strong woman. It is worse in thecoun
try than in the cities, or else I have
noticed it more. I nave thought it comes
partly from the absence of a near physi
cian.
The country is the faker's paradise. He
can sell anything if he only puts diseases
enough on the wrapper. Why I have seen
shelf after shelf full of medicine bottles
in farmhouses, full of more kinas of
messes than I ever knew were brewed.
All these remedies were swallowed, too,
and the swallower lived to tell the tale.
The stories told of the cures would fill
volumes, and each season calls fonh a new
one. I have been advised to kill myself
with hundreds of medicines while my
health has been perfect. After a hard
day's work, when fatigue caused pallor
tend heavy eyes, whose retoedy is sleep, I
wiave been pressed and importuned to take
m little of Somebody's Invigorator, with
the assurance that if I took it regularly
I'd never become tired like this. It must
be rare medicine to overcome the effect of
cause. But I never tried it.
You need medicine in the spring to
thin your blood after the cold of winter.
bly on account of the late spell of warm
weather. They can be seen in ninny parts
of the State flying over the marshes in
large nooks ready for the hunters, who
are likewise ready for them. From the
outlook it is likely that shooting will be
good this year. Ducks are plentiful and
the weather promises to be just the right
kind to make it pleasant to go after them.
But there is no telling what a week will
bring forth, and it may be by that time
the game will have all gone to some other
locality.
For the last two weeks the hunters have
been visiting their arks, cabins and lodges,
putting things in readiness for the open
ing of the season. The methods of going
after ducks vary with the different local
ities. In the San Joaqnin and Suisun
marshes arks are used, while in the Alviso
and other marshes along the bay shore
the hunters camp in small cabins built
and maintained for the purpose.
For the last six months these places
have been deserted by their owners. The
frying-pans have rusted on the walls and
rats have run about as they pleased. The
big arks were towed from the marshes in
the spring and laid up in some place
where they could be taken care of.
Numbers of these were in Stockton and
Sacramento harbors and at the cities alone
the bay shore. There they lay, drying up
in the hot summer sun, and all the while
their owners were waiting anxiously for
the season to reopen. The real duck
hunter does not care much for any other
sport. He may take a sort of interest in
almost anything else, but his heart is on
the marshes. He longs for the crisp morn
ing air that gives such steady nerves, and
the beautiful fat birds that look so tempt
ing when served broiled, fried, stewed, or,
in fact, any way.
Nearly all of the Stockton arks have
been towed to the shooting grounds,
where they are being put in order for the
season. They are generally laid up in
some "good" place, not far from town, so
the owners can get to and from them
without much trouble. Many of these
arks are as cozy as a bis ocean steamer and
are, of course, not likely to be shaken

]oin the ranks of those women and men â
there is a great army of them â who take
medicine instead of taking common-sense
care of themselves. The medicine habit
grows and fastens itself on one as fast as
any other pernicious habit. We all know
those who have lost faith in their phy
sician because he gave them so little for
their money; "just talked about diet and
baths and exercise 1 Never told me a thing
to take!"
These people, some from notions of
economy and some from a mania for tak
ing something, begin to try every new
medicine, begin to read the symptoms on
the bottle and the wrapper and to find
they have them. If they are"rnn down,"
and most of them are. from the hetero
geneous messes they pour into tender
stomachs, each new remedy will for a
time stimulate. When the effect wears off
the victims look about for bottles new.
They grow to watch themselves and those
about them for the slightest look or change
to warrant a dose of the reigning mess.
A spoonful in the morning to wake them
is as necessary as a spoonful at night to
pat them to sleep. Each meal must be
either preceded or iollowed by a dose, ac
cording to directions, and never day or
night is the tortured stomach free to do
its own work.
A woman works all morning in the
house, among the stuffy airs and odors,
and when in the afternoon there comes a
time ior rest she sits behind closed win
dows and sews or reads, and to make up
for the air she has not breathed all day
she takes some medicine.
The genius sits humped over a desk half
the day, writing, and sits humped over a

the life-giving oxygen were denied us?

Once one gels the medicine habit the
power of endurance is lost There are
pains we must bear and expect. There
are aches and stiffness after unusual
fatigue, there are headaches from over
eating or from worry, there are wakeful
night hours. They cease with rest and
nature's care, and what a weak will it
is which resorts to a little black botile
rather than face a few hours of wakeful
ness. Better get up and do something or
watch the quiet stars than to put a demon

around in such a way as to destroy all ap
petite for ducks. But duck-hunters usually
have good appetites, and no case is known
of where a man failed to take one with
him. '
The most popular duck-shootiug grounds
around San Francisco are on the Alviso
and Suisun marshes along the bay shore.
The former is, of course, the easiest to get
to and must be considered one of the most
unique places of its bind in the country.
It is reaily a duck-shooting village as
there is no other business carried on there,
and no inhabitants except hunters and the
men who watch the cabins.
The Alviso marsh duck-shooting village
is known as "The Bridges," for it is close
to the bay shore, three miles from Atviso,
and the railroad crossed numerous
sloughs at that point over trestles and
other structures of a similar kind. In all
there are twenty houses, owned by men in
this City except two, which belong to San
Jose people. It is here that the duck
shooters go for a good day's sport They
are sure to get it because nobody in
terferes with them. In fact, every induce
ment is held out for them to go there.
The syndicate that owns the marsh allows
anybody to shoot over it, and the owners
of the cabins have to pay only $1 a year
ground rent. Special trains are run for
their benefit, and on many occasions last
year there were over 200, men on the
grounds. Everybody respects everybody
else, and if a man fixes a place for himself
he can feel sure that nobody else will in
terfere with it. At least, such a thing has
never happened so far as known.
The Alviso shooting village is located
in such a position that it is not far from
the bay shore, and is on a slough that
empties into that body of water about one
mile from the place. It is very handy, and ,
makes thing equally convenient for hunters
who have boats and those who prefer to -
walk over the marsh land and shoot what- â¢
ever they can see. (
All during the summer the caoins at 1
this place have been vacant, but within i
the last week have been occupied by those I
who were putting them in shape for the
coming season. This made things quit e <
of a danger which doe 3 not exist, and with
the example before them in every news

Medicines are necessary; doctors are
necessary; but nature is a powerful old
dame still, if she be given a fair show.
Men smoke; women drink tea. It is
hard to tell which habit shatters the nerves
more. No one denies the existence of tea
topers. They endure tortures if kept
twelve hours without their stimulant.
More women than realize the fact are on
the road. If one gets to the place where
she has a headache if she misses her tea
for a meal it is time to take heed. If the
first thought when a little tired is a desire
for tea or coffee instead of food the. evil
has begun. That woman need never say
a word to the male relative who must
smoke after each meal. Of course, each
one of us hugs her own pet vice and says
the others are worse, yet the effect follows
cause. It is so much easier to cure other
people's bad habits than our own.
There is another litile habit which
makes us bundles of nerves, ready to do
desperate deeds â eating. Now eating is

lively down that way. There is a grea
deal to be done before a duck-shooting
cabin is ready for occupancy, although all
of them have been left in tue most perfect
order.
But a great many things may happen
in six months. Very likely the sheetiron
stovepipe has rusted away and a new one
must be put in place. The hunting clothes
must be hung out and aired and consider
able cleaning must be done. But the boys
work with a will, for it is a job they like
in view of the amount of fun they Know
they are likely to get out of it.
As well as getting the house in shape,
it is necessary to overhaul the boats that
have been drying during the summer.
These must b6 put into water and allowed
to soak until the cracks in them close up,
after which they must be hauled out and
allowed to partly dry, and then be given a
coat of paint. All this takes time, and at
least a week is necessary to get things in
shape around a moderate-sized cabin.
Another thing to be done is to build
"blinds" out of which the ducks cau be
shot as they fly overhead. These are gen
erally made out of an old hogshead and
covered with brush so as to conceal them
from view. The barrel is partly buried in
the ground so that little of it can be
seen. The dogs are taught to lie close to
the barrel, out of sight, until the game
drops.
It is while constructing these that the
builder is sorely tried. The buiJder is
sure to be a hunter and while at work
takes his gun with him to be ready for
any curlews that may fly near.
At such times fine fat ducks are likely
to 11 y overhead. It looks such an easy
thing to drop a couple of them and nobody
be any wiser. But the game warden is a
close watcher and has a most inconve
nient habit of turning up when he is not
wanted. It is very inconsiderate of him,
âºo be sure, but that does not stop his
coming. And when he does come Mr. _
hunter who is unable to tell a duck from ~
ci curlew is likely to pay about $25 for his
fun. As a consequence tte ducks fly by
without striking dancer. But things will
â¢hange after next Thursday.

Idle purposeless leisure is Satan's own

Hearts Content to be not less than lift een
million dollars. Every device that prom
ises increased speed of signaling over the
present cables is exploited in the hope of
enlarging the capacity of transmission
and thereby increasing the revenue of the
cable. Unfortunately but very slight im
provement, if any, seems probable in this
particular. In the meantime, increasing
business and expanding markets clamor
for greater facilities of ocean telegraphy.
Peculiar interest therefore attaches to
the announcement that there has been
discovered a means whereby telegraphic
and telephonic communication may be
had between distant points, as Ne w York
and Liverpool, without the use of wires.
A number of inventors in the field of
applied electricity, among whom are
Hughes of England, Siemens of Germany
and Calaban of New York, have experi
mented upon induced currents, in the
hope of solving the problem of telegraph
ing without wires. One of these devices
was exploited by Edison in his attempt to
telegraph from a moving train. But the
cumbersome character of the machinery
and its unsatisfactory results relegated it
to the domain of scientific toys. Very
pretty, but commercially impracticable.
The latest in this line is based upon the
assertion that the earth is surrounded by
a current of electricity moving from west
to east; that this current is fairly con
stant at a certain altitude, and that its
potentiality increases toward the equator
and diminishes toward the poles.
The discoverer has been for some months
past engaged In a series of experiments
conducted from the summit of Longs
Peak, a mountain of some 14,000 feet eleva
tion, located about eighty miles north of
Denver, Colo. Another station is located
upon one of the high peaks of the Uintah
range in Utah, immediately west
The discoverer claims that messages
have been transmitted between these
points. The next trial will be had using
Longs Peak, and the top of Mount Shasta,
or some adjoining peak, which is nearly
upon the same meridian of latitude as
Longs Peak.
The technical description of the ap
paratus employed is kept a secret, but its
operation is understood to be an affair

M Bric-a-Brac Doctor
In the workshop of the museum in
Golden Gate Park there has been working
for some time a man who has accom
plished wonderful results. He is a hard
workine, conscientious artist, a Parisian
by birtb, whose name is A. Barthelet.
Seen in his "atelier," as he calls his work
shop, he is surrounded by a great mass of
bric-a-brac, bisqueware, wood-carving, ma
jolica ware, ancient pottery and curios of
all kinds, all in a demoralized condition,
looking. very much as if they had been
struck by a cyclone.
There is a marble bust of one of the
monarchs of England whose nose is so
badly shattered that it looks as if it were
beyond repair. There are the broken bits
of a figure of Marcus Manilas, who saved
Rome during the terrible Gallic siege, and
which is a sample of what that individual
must have looked like after being hurled
from the Tarpeian rock Jor having aspired
to the monarchy. On a table is a shat
tered statue of victory crowning a hero
with a crown of laurels, but the crown is
lacking; there remains only a fragment of
it. Against a wall is a very ancient paint
ing from -which part of the coloring has
peeled off, while at the bench where the
artist sits is a one-legged and one-armed
equestrian figure of Napoleon I, showing
the result of careless handling.
To the ordinary onlooker these and the
many other cracked and broken articles
appear as a mass of* useless truck fit only
for the ashman's cart, but not so to the
bric-a-brac doctor. "My dear sir," sÂ»ys
be, pointing to one or the other of these
articles, "these will be put in such condi
tion that it will be impossible for any one
to detect where the break ended and the
repair commenced; but to be able to ac
complish this one must be gifted with a
great amount of patience, a perfect
knowledge of sculpture, wood-carving,
painting, color and an imitative faculty
which, I believe, is inborn. Take this
figure of Victory, the crown in her
hand, you see, is shattered, leaving only
a piece half an inch long, just enough to
give me an idea of what it had originajly
been. Well, I will have to drill a hole in
what remains (for you notice it is china
ware), insert a wire and on thai, build an
other crown of plastic matter in imitation
certain potentiality is liberated at th
place of sending in a series of inter
mittent pulsations corresponding to the
dots and dashes of the Morse alphabet.
This certain charge of electrical potential
is carried by the natural electrical strata
current in the same manner as the wires at
present used perform their functions, and
is received at the objective station by a
specially constructed electrical condenser
which operates a magnetic balance.
The transmission of electrical energy
without wires across a considerable body
of water was accomplished in Europe some
years ago by a wealthy dabbler in experi
mental science. But for some unexplained
reason no practical application has been
made of his labors. In this case a lot ot
wires were stretched along and parallel to
the coast of a strait several miles in width.
On the opposite side of the strait were
stretched a similar line of wires. Upon
charging the first set of wires with a strong
current of electricity a current was mani
fest upon the wires on the other side of the
water.
Should the discovery of the Colorado
genius prove to be what is claimed for
it, oceanic canles will be things of the
past. Electrical communication will then
be had between points by eittier employ
ing as the stations of transmission and
receipt natural elevations, like the tops of
mountains, or, where such are lacking,
the erection of lofty pole-towers.
It is claimed for the transmitting and
receiving instruments that their mutual
electrical balance is self-maintaining. So
that if the balance of a transmitter ex
posed on the summit of a mountain be
disturbed, every receiver on every other
mountain situated within a belt say of
two miles in width upon the same lati
tude will instantly be thrown out of bal
ance and indicate the signal transmitted.
This occurs when transmitters and
receivers are adjusted each and all
to. the same balance. Were their
mutual balances to differ, there would be
no ; and. in this is a most valua
ble feature, as thereby a million trans
mitters may be placed at each station and
a corresponding million of receivers be
side them, and if the electrical balance of
each set â i. c. transmitter and receiver â
be changed in the slightest form from the
other sets, it will be possible to transmit
and receive,,^- â million separate and dis
tinct mesSages without inteiference.
Such are the possibilities of the new

nicety of coloring will hide the lines of
old and new. This piece lam working on
now requires a new arm and a new leg

"One of the most difficult features of the
art of restoration Is that of reproducing
the effects of lime upon articles, as, for in
stance, on this picture," and he holds up
the one from which a patch of color has
disappeared. "This wilt have to be
matched so that even the most expert can
not tell that it has been 'touched up,' as I
call it The colors I put on wW have to
be mixed to the shade that the original
that has been on for 200 years has turned,
and that is where a knowledge of coloring
comes in. The work that Ido is the de
ception of art," and he draws attention to
a very pretty ornament. "What do you
think of it?" he &ays.
"What is the matter with that?" I ask,
for it looks as if there were not a blemish
on it.
"There is not," says C. P. Wilcomb, the
curator of the museum, who is standing
by, "but you ought to have seen it before
it was repaired. More than a quarter of
it has been built on."
'â¢Th 9 ability to become an adept in the
art of doctoring articles of vertu is not
acquired in a day or a week," says
the bric-a-brac doctor, "but it takes
years of close study, and hardly a day
passes but that I discover some means by
which I can improve on my methods.
Particular cements have to be made to
suit Darticuiar articles, non-shrinkable
plastics have to be made and there must
be a study how to deceiva tie eye. In
marble it may cot be sufficient to simply
cement on the piece that was fractured,
but it may be necessary to increase the
original fracture, and by manipulation,
after restoring the piece brokÂ»w <-ff, give
the fracture the appearance of * aatural
in the bloctc."
This peculiar art is a wonderfth one, and
by its craft collectors may restore many
damaged beauties they would like to pos

to restore treasures whioJi have become

THEIR CLUB.
Bvj Bessie V. Taylor.
What times the girls had deciding what
kind of a club to form ! Lillian and Daisy,
who always shared thoir secrets, were puz
zling their curly heads over it wnen a
merry-faced boy marched in.
"We've just been having the jolliest
time; why didn't you come when I waved
to you?"
"Well, we did want to," Lillian an
swered, "but we were thinking of some
thing. Oh, Bert, do tell us what to do.
We girls want to get up a little club."
Brother Bert could not fail them now,
so after looking serious for a moment he
said, "Why not try a glee club? Just
meet at each other's homes and make
caudy or popcorn. We boys might join
as honorary members and help dispose of
the refreshments."
Just tnen the doorbell rang and the next
moment their friend Myrtle came in.
Bert gave her his chair and after the
general greetings she exclaimed, "I be
lieve I have hit on a plan, girls. Down at
Clare we had a little society and made and
sold things for poor people â "
"A capital idea!" interrupted Bert, "if
you don't have a glee club I am sure a
home mission would be just the thing.
You could surely make some mittens by
next spring!"
"Now, Bert Curtiss," exclaimed Lillian,
"ii you are so bound to bother us we'll go
straight upstairs."
"So sorry to leave you, ladies," Bert re
plied with much gravity, "but really I
must go. Here's success to the newly
formed Home Mission for the Needy!"
and waving his hat he bowed and leit the
room.
The girls laughed, but were soon ear
nestly discussing their plans. Mrs. Cur
tiss came in unnoticed, but finding them
talking so earnestly she quietly closed the
door.
On the following Wednesday, when the
boys were out playing again, "I say,
Bert," cried Ralph Fay, "what's going on
at your house? Are the girls having a
party ?"
"I guess not Why?"
"Well, I've seen six or eight go in sin^e
school closed."
"Oh 1" and Bert gave a low whistle, "I
suppose that is the new club."
After supper that night Lillian told her
father ail about the club and its officers.
"0/ course we had to have a president, so
we all voted for Myrtle; then we chose
Cora for secretary and I am treasurer."
Lillian noticed a twinkle in papa's eye,
so she added: "You see we have officers
like any society."
"I suppose, father," Bert said, "that
they will want to keep their money in
your safe next.'' *
"No," explained Lillian, "I have a place
for that. Each of us pays 5 cents a week,
and we have 50 cents already. I know,
papa," Lillian continued, "Bert doesn't
think we'll do anything, but he'll find
he's mistaken. I'll tell you next Wednea
day what we are planning. Now we are
making little holders to sell."
"I think," said mamma, "that the girls
are beginning well, and may ba a real
help to some one if they keep on."
"We shall try," Lillian answered, and
getting her good-night kisses she went up
to her room.
â¢ * â¢ â¢
That same night another little girl took
her good-night kiss much earlier, and by
this time was fast asleep. Her mamma
sat near her in their scantily furnished
room, and looked sadly at the face of the
little sleeper.
"IÂ£ I could only get it," she was think
ing, "but I cannot afford it for a year or
so: then, perhaps, that little ankle will be
so weak that even a good brace would not
help it." and she wiped away the tears
that would come as she thought of the
days when this room had been so differ
i ent â the days before the death of Addie's
father. Now they were so lonely. Addle
was the only child, and the thought that
she might be lame added many a heart
ache.
At school the little girl was a general
favorite, and Miss Fay, her teacher, who
noticed how the weak little ankle turned
at every step, talked kindly to her about
it, and secretly wished that she might help
the child, yet saw no way to do it.
However, she told Mrs. Curtiss about it
one day. "I am sure she could be helped,"
Lillian's mother had answered. "I am
going to the city this week, and shall
ascertain what can be done."
The following Wednesday the girls met
as usual, and were a little surprised when
Mrs. Curtiss came in, and said if they
were willing, she would present a little
plan to them.
She then told them of a recent visit with
Miss Fay to a certain tiny home, and ex
plained their intention of getting a. brace
for Addie. "Oh, Mrs. Curtiss!" Myrtle
exclaimed, "you mean that we may help.
How glad we shall all be !"
Mrs. Curtiss sruiied. "I am not a mem
ber of the club," she said, "so please ex
cuse me now."
Wasn't that club pleased with the idea!
Of course each one agreed with the presi
dent that it was a splendid idea.
"Now your brother Bert and Ralph will
see that we are in earnest," Daisy cried to
Lillian.
I need not tell you all the ways in
which the club raised the money, only
this: Mrs. Curtiss got the brace and the
girls paid for it, earning the whole
amount.
It is hard to tell who had the most
pleasure out of it. Addie and her mother
felt the deepest of gratitude, but the girls
all declared that they never enjoyed any
thing quite so much as their work, in what
Bert called their "Home Mission."

WHAT THEY SAW.
It was built of granite, with numerous
windows, and broad marble steps leading
up to a wide entrance. What had been a
fine cupola sat upon the top of the build
ing, keeping watch over tne surrounding
country. Now, part of the walls were
fallen, some of the steps gone, and the
whole place was in a state of decay.
"How shall we get in?" asked Alice
Burton, "those steps are not safe, and the
windows are too high for us to reach,
besides â "
"Never mind, Alice," broke in her
brother, "I know how to get in. Follow
me," and off he trotted in such haste that
bis companions were forced to run in or
der to keep up with him.
Around at the back of the house he
stopped beside a small door, which was

plainly visible. It stood partly open, and
they saw a dark passage beyond.
"Snail we have to go through there?"
asked Dotty, shuddering.
"Yes; now, girls, don't be afraid."
As they entered they all felt a trifle
"creepy," for the place was gloomy and
the air damp.
At last they came to a flight of dark
winding stairs. Ascending these they
found themselves in a spacious hall, with
doors opening on all sides, and to the left
aeain rose another flight of stairs.
Looking around they discovered four
large and two smaller rooms upon this
floor, connected by narrow doors and hav
ing long windows.
After peering into all the corners they
visited the old and weather-beaten cupola.
It consisted of a large room, having eight
sides, each containing a window.
"Oh! what a splendid view," cried Bes

stood in the old tower of the " haunted

Herman Hutter and Charles Whitman
of Missoula, armed with rifles and accom
panied by a deerhound, one day went uj
the Rattlesnake River in quest of ame.
They climbed the mountains to the Jeft of
the stream and separated, taking opposite
sides of the ridge in hopes of bagging a
deer. Whitman came down the Rattle
snake side, and soon after separating from
his companion he slipped and fell, sliding
some 200 feet down the mountain side.
He vainly tried to stop himself by digging
into the snow with his bands and clutch
ing at brush and saplings till, just as he
was about to fall over the cliff into the
Rattlesnake, some forty feet below, he
clasped a strong sapling with one hand
and was left dangling in the air over the
precipice. By a strong effort he got his
arm round' the sapling, and grasping his
wrist with the disengaged band heawaited
his inevitable fall. Tbe dog, seeing his
master slip, followed him to the edge of
the cliff and whined piteously. Suddenly
he dashed off over the hill and disap
peared. When nearly exhausted Whit
man heard his companion, Hutter, above
him, coming to his assistance. He gath
ered renewed courage and held on desper
ately till Hutter came and rescued him.
Hutter says that the dog came up to him
and aei/.ed hold of his clothing, whining.
He turned upon him and the dog ran off.
Repeating the strange maneuver, Hutter
suspected that something was wrong and
followed the dog to Whitman's rescue. â

The want of cordial feeling between
France and Germany makes itself appar

describes a little scene at the dinner-table
of a Swiss hotel, where a Frenchman and
a German sat opposite each other.
"You are a Frenchman, I suppose,"
said the German, when the meal was half
over.
"Yes," was the reply; "but how did
you find it out?"
"Because you eat so much bread," said
the German.
Then there was silence till dinner was
nearly done, when the Frenchman said:
"You are a German, I presume?"
"lam; but what made yon think so?"
"Because you eat so much of every
thing," was the amiable retort.

HOW POPPY LEABNED NOT TO MIND.
When we first had the doggie George
tausht him to mind.
He was so round and fat that when he
ran he rolled all over himself, but he
was very bright and George soon taught
him to carry a stick. He would speak to
puppy and throw a little stick across the
porch and Mr. Doggie would waddle after
it and take it back to him.
Alice and I thought it was cute and we
would try to make him do it for us.
George said we would spoil him, because
whenever he. wouldn't mind us and
"acted" we would pick him up and hug
bim. That isn't tue ri.ht way to do, and
I hope it you ever try to train a dog you
will be firm and make him mind.
The puppy soon got so he would try to
make us iaugh by running away with the
stick, and by barking at it and dancing
around it with his head on one side and
his big ears napping over his eyes.
He always obeyed George quite well, but
that young man refused to teach him to
do tricks just as soon as we began to spoi
him. The way the little fellow did not
mind us was funny. If we called him to
us he would run off, or else roll over and
over on the ground and wave his feet in
the air. If we tried to send him after a
stick he would climb up into our laps.
When we wished him to lie still he would
bite our shoes and pull our clothes, and
when we were in for a romp he would lie
down and wink and blink at us, as though
he was too sleepy to keep his eyes open.
Altogether he was a cunning but very
naughty little doggie.

Dear Editor: 1 never wrote a letter to any
newspaper, although I am 15 years old. My
father has neVer taken The Call, but I have
read it at different places and was much
pleased with it. I live in Monterey County
and I am going to the Lake District School.
There are thirty-six pupils and we have a good
teacher too. Well, I guess I will have to close
as I can't think of anything else to write.

letter as I can, because I have never written to
The Call.
I have two sisters and two brothers. I com
posed this little verse myself, and hope you
will like and publish it in your paper :
Two little hands, so soft and so white,
This the left and this is the right;
Five little chubby fingers on each,
With which I can hold a plum or a peach,
And when I get as big as you
Lots of things my hands can do.

read the letters and try to get the puzzles. I
do not get the answers right sometimes, but I
guessed four to-day and hope they are correct.
I go to the Mill Valley School and am in the

for Modem Warfare
But very few of the many readers of
The Call know anything about the con
struction and operation of the numberless
little appliances that are used in modern
warfare, for the reason that such informa
tion is kept secret, because the knowledge
of the operation confers upon the nation
possessing it an advantage other less
wise nations.
One of the greatest difficulties in se
curing accurate gun fire at sea has been
the want of definitely fixing ! the distance
of the object fired at. : Heretofore the de
termination of distances at sea has been a
â¢ matter of personal judgment and liable to
error. Now.the : navy employs a met:
of ascertaining distances very much like
that used by astronomers in ascertaining
the distance of the stars; a mathematical
operation by which the problem of
parallel is solved. It is based upon the
well-known rule of plane geometry; that
given the angles at which two sides of a
triangle subtend from a known base line,
the length of the perpendicular is easily
computed.
When the occasion arises that the com
mander of one of Uncle Sam's wars ips
desires to know how far distant is a vessel
the "electrical distance indicator" is
brought into requsition. Two officers take
their places, one at eac â  end of the ship.
These officers are provided with a form of
telescope called a theodolite, which is
mounted upon a vertical axis so it can
swing from side to side. Underneath the
theodolite is a semicircle of German silver
wire, and a light spring attached to the
end of the theodolite presses upon the
wire. At any convenient place in the ship
is placed a specially constructed galvano
meter, and conducting wires connect a
small battery with the galvanometer and
with each of the theodolites*. Now German
silver offers a. very great resistance to the
passage of the electric current, and as
each th odolite is swung over the semi
circular German silver wire when the
officer points his theodolite to the distant j
vessel the resistance to the electrical cur- j
rent is increased or diminished. This car- |
rent is at all times circulating round the
galvanometer coils, and consequently the
deflection of the galvanometer needle is
governed by the amount of resistance ,
fixed by the movements of the two
theodolites. Instead of the galvanometer
scale being divided into degree*, as is the
usual way, it Indicate? feet, and the needle j
points unerringly to that number indicat- â 
ing the length of the perpendicular of the I
triangle, of which the distance between
the two officers is the base line, and the
distant vessel the vertex of the other two
sides.
A Wonderful JteW Light.
Quite recently there has been brought
out by the French navy a mysterious de- ]
vice known as "la ratiere," or the "rat
trap light." It is a thing of small dimen
sions and is placed on the deck of the ves
sel. It throws out an electric light that
can only be discovered dead ahead. La
ratiere is constructed as follows: A square
box has within it at one end a concave
mirror, in front of which is adjusted an
arc light. The light is focused upon a
plano-convex lens placed midway or the
length of the box, so that the rays of light
are projected through a silvered tube as a '
bund.c of parallel rays. By the sides of
the outer end of the silvered tube are
placed two prisms, one of red and the
other of green glass, and through which a
portion of the light passes in divergent
rays. At a distance of several miles the
light of la ratiere appears as a small point
and consequently difficult of detection to
those not knowing the quarter in which
to look for it. Its detection is thus re
duced to a minimum, as it can only be
seen within a radius of a few feet at such
distance.
The use of the red and green rays are
for the purpose of enabling the vessel to
whom the signal is intended to Know in
which direction to steer so as to come
within the zone of white light should the
white ray disappear. By means cf this
invention night signals can be made when
flashlights and rockets might be useless
or liable to betray the position of the fleet
to the enemy. It can also be used as a
quid" to a squadron in line, with all
other lights out, in dangerous latitudes,
as it cannot be seen either to the right or
left, but only dead ahead or dead astern.
The French Admiralty attaches great im
portance to this light, and has taken
extraordinary precautions to guard it
against discovery. The Call for the first
time makes public its nature. For pur
poses of maintaining the projection of the
light upon a horizontal plane, which
otherwise would be disturbed by the toss
ing and pitching of the vessel, the lamp
is arranged to float in a vessel containing
mercury, while an electrically connected
compass maintains the azimuth direction
of the light at any set angle.
y\r\ Intelligent Torpedo.
A very important feature in naval war
fare is tbe torpedo. By this device it is
possible to fire large charges of ex
plosive underneath a vessel. Torpedoes
are of three kindb â fixed, mobile and auto
mobile. Tbe first â the fixed â consist of
receptacles containing - r unpowder orother
explosive, and areancbored at the bo torn
depth, and consequently its approach is
of a channel or harbor. They contain a
fuse and are connected with tbe shore by
an electric wire, so that should an enemy's
vessel pass over them they may be ex
ploded by the operator on the shore send
ing a current of electricity through the
wire. The second class of torpedoes are
fired from a tube by compressed air. Of
this class the Wbitehead is a prominent
example. Nearly every warship is now
fitted to use these deadly and destructive
missiles. This torpedo is about six feet
long, made of bronze or copper. It carries
several hundred pounds of explosive, and
contains a small engine actuated by com
pressed air, for the purpos< of driving ti.e
propeller with which each torpedo is
fitted. In operation the tube is pointed
toward tbe vessel it is desired to destroy
and the torpedo ejected from the tube by
a powerful charge of compressed air.
Just as the torpedo leaves tbe tube a
trigger is released, bringing into play the
little air engine within the torpedo, which
assists in maintaining tbe velocity of the
torpedo. They are lairly accurate for a
few hundred yards only and are not
adapted. to long-distance work. Once the
torpedo leaves the tube them is no means
of controlling the direction of its flight,
and the accuracy of its course is depend
ent upon the care wrth which it is aimed
and the nature of tbe water currents it en
counters in its passage. The third classâ
the auto-mobile â is a torpedo that con
tains a propelling mechanism and a steer
ing g^ar that are controlled from the deck
of the vessel or the station on shore from
which the torpedo is fired. In some in
stances the motive power is carbonic acid
gas or compressed air, though generally it
is electricity. The torpedo carries a cable j
several mile? in length, which is paid out j
from the body of the torpedo as it goes on i
its way.
This cable consists of a number of insu
lated wires, over which electric currents |
are sent by the operator to control the j
mechanism of the torpedo and co direct ,
its movement*, making it co ahead or j
astern, or stop, and steering it to the 1
right or left. The torpedo is almost sub
merged and carries a couple of rods pro
jecting above the water, the tops of which

All theories that nave been advanced

and any one has a right to guess. Suppose
we do some guessing and at tbe same time
use a little common-sense â very common
sense, indeed, for it is not very scientific
nor hard to under-tand. Every truth is
simple enough when we know it, and it is
quite possible that if we proceed on very
simple lines we may arrive at a great
truth.
To begin, tbe comet Is not a privileged

character. It must exist in conformity
with the. great law which rult*s all the
atoms in space. How does this law mani
fest itself to us as we are able to see it ?
We see that every solid, such as a planet,
is spherical in shape. We know that
every system is a great flat "wheel," and
that "a wheel within a wheel" is simply
a planetary wheel within a solar wheel.
We know also that tbe bodies which are
not solid â :he nebulous masses in space â
appear of various shapes, but that those
which have definite shape are also great
flat "wheels."
The more dense they are the nearer to
the spherical shape they become, and we
are safe in assuming that the first point

of manifestation of the solid body is near
tbe center of the wheel. All this seems
perfectly natural and no one's feelings
are hurt up to this pomt â but we can
not stop here. We must reason a little
farther.
A comet is a nebulous body, and there
fore is a "wheel."
It does not look like a wheel?
We do not see all of it; no more than
we see all of the moon illuminated when
it is new. We see only such portions of
the wheel as the sun permits us to see.
Can this be demonstrated?
Let us take a ball of white-hot iron into
the bright sunlight. It appears almost

luminous. We then take two white-hot
balls and place one in the shadow of the

fortunately, what is visible to the operator
is liable to be seen by the enemy, and the
success of the attack is thereby jeopar
dized to that extent; for if the torpedo is
discovered by the enemy it may be de

purpose. Qui c recently there has been

But there are objections to this?
Of course there are.
All comets are not the same in appear
ance?
That is also true of nebulse.
All comets do not have tails?
Nor do all "wheels" lie in the same
plane. The sun's rays must strike the
wheel on the edge to produce the longest
tail, and if they strike the wheel from a
vertical direction there might be no tail at
all.
But some comets have more than one
tail?
That is true, but it is also true that some
wheels have more than one spoke.
Why are the tails of some comets curved ?
For the same reason that the spokes of
the wheels, the spiral nebulae, are also
covered and for the additional reason that
it takes light time to travel. The speed
of light is enormous only to our finite
comprehensionâ it is slow in comparison
with the immensity of space. This can
be easily illustrated by the stream of water
issuing from a garden hose when the noz
zle is suddenly turned to one side.
But the speed of the water stream near
the nozzle is greater than away from it
Quite true, but if sound travels faster

This torpedo would seem to be endowed
with almost human sentiency. It Is under
the absolute control of its operator, who
can cause it to sink or me at will and to
move in every desired direction, and it
communicates to the operator continu
ously its exact position as to deptb, direc
tion of movement, lateral drift, etc. It
also tells him when it contacts with the
enemy and the character of the contact,
whether it is at the side of the enemy's
vessel or beneath it. Of course the man
ner of operating so valuable an arm of
warfare is preserved a jealously guarded
secret.

In January, 1846, a peculiar thing hap
pened to Biela's comet. It appeared to
separate or split into two distinct comets
of unequal brightness. During February
the lesser of the two increased in bright
ness until it became equal to its com
panion, and then began to grow fainter,
until in March it disappeared entirely,
although the "comet" continued visible
nearly a month longer. Now, how shall
we account for this apparently awkward
fact in a very simple way ?
The answer is this: Biela's comet was
what astronomers would cail a "binary"
âthat is to say, it was dojible, or had two
nuclei which revolve about a common
center. The telescope Shows us illustra
tions both in nebulae and in binary stars.
When the nuclei are in the same line of
vision from the earth and appear
superimposed, we see one comet
When by reason of their motion
they appear to separate, we see two
comets with the phenomena pre
cisely as described. Such a system is not
so staple as a wheel with a single nucleus,
and when this comet appeared in 1852,
divided and with the brightness changing
as it ought to, this was positively its last
appearance.
But Donati's comet in 1858 presented
some entirely different features. Its tail
was a marvel of beauty and appeared to be
split diagonally into many stripes of nebu
lous matter which had no nuclei. Most
curious of all and most puzzling were two
great streamers which emerged from the
head in nearly straight lines, although
the "tail" proper was curved. How will
our guess apply to this problem? If one
tail should be curved, why was the other
tail straight? The answer must be simple
if it is to be true.
Let us look to the nebulae for an answer.
Surely there must be one that can suggest
the answer. Indeed, there are several;
they are known as spiral nebulae, and look
like great Fourth of July pinwheels.
Some of the spirals or spokes will account
for the curved tail, and other spokes will
make the straight tails if viewed at an
other angle, which must of necessity be the
case. This is made simple by assuming a
vortex motion or a shape similar to a pro
peller or windmill.
We all know that in perspective the
shapes of the blades â or sposes, as we
have called them â are different. It will
be conceded that we view all bodies in
space in perspective; just as we do objects
upon the earth. In fact most of these
nebultE are seen at an angle and appear as
elilpsea or nearly flat disks.
Now let us apply our guess to the comet
Rordame, which appeared in the western
sky in July, 1893. Its tail was very well
behaved when first seen, but a few days
latTJt presented a decidedly broken ap
pearance with bright, irregular patches of
light like lesser nuclei along tbe tail.
The explanation is that the comet Bor

or wheel, and that its plane when ex
tended happened at that time to intersect
the sun.
The spiral was very distinct, and several
of the "spokes" were intersected by the
I shadow of the bead. We would therefore
expect that if the nebulae revolved per
i ceptibly these condensations of illumi
nation would appear to move away
I from the head, and this is precisely what
did occur and was observed on July 13.
The â¢ame phenomenon was noted in
Swift's comet in April, 1892, and in
Brooks' comet in October, 1893. There is
also another fact which bears very sig-

nificantly upon our guess, and that is that
th"se condensations appear to move away
from the iiead with an increasing velocity.
This is exactly what they ought to do from
the nature of tbe spiral.
There is one feature common to all
comets which absolutely disproves all for
mer theories, and yet, singularly, proves
our guess to be a good one. A comet ap
pears to get smaller and its tail to get
shorter as it approaches the sun, but
when it is leaving the sun's neichborhood
the reverse appears to take place. If this
phenomenon results from the difference
in the intensities of the light of the sun
and the nebula it is evident that this dif
ference increases as the nebula approaches
the sun and decreases as it leaves it.
Therefore the result would be as de
scribed.
One might speculate indefinitely upon
the details of the relations between
comets and the nebulae, but the intelligent
readers can do this for themselves, and it
is unnecessary to fill space with further
illustrations. We all know what a small
sunbeam shining into a dusty room looks
like, and it is a poor law that is not
universal. If the dust was self-luminous
it would be visible to us everywhere in the
room excepting in the sunbeam.
Astronomers are in general very fair
minded men, and if our guess appears to
them to be a true one they will be glad to
say so, even if it comes from a very humble
astronomer.

The recent telegraphic news from Los
Angeles to the effect that an electric line
is projected into La Canada Valley was
not of startling interest to the public in
these times of political strife. To a few,
however, to whose ears "La Canada" has
a definite sound, the news was received
with mnch pleasure. It means the open
ing of an almost matchlessly pictur
esque territory, where olives, oranges,
lemons, and, in fact, almost all
fruits, attain wondrous growth and
flbvor and a corresponding marketable
value. The little valley, only twelve
miles fiom Los Angeles, is nlso a wonder
ful health resort, and though as yet some
what inaccessible except to equine motor
power, has been penetrated by several
wealthy men of Southern California, who
have built magnificent residences there,
by several sanitariums and by many fruit
growers.
The projected electric railway is to run
from Los Angeles via Glendale and
Verdugo Park through the Verdugo
Canyon into the valley of La Canada;
along the valley from northwest to south
east, emerging in the vicinity of the
Devils Gate at Arroyo Park; thence
to Pasadena and back again to Los An
geles. Thus a sort of belt line will be

It is designed to utilize the two branches
of the Terminal Railway, as now con
structed; that is, the branch which runs
from Los Angeles to Altadena, via Pasa
dena, and the branch which extends to
Verdugo Park, via Glendale, will be con
nected by an electric band. From Ver
dugo Park to La Canada, the Verdugo
road will doubtless be available. The two
rail lines, starting from a common center
at Los Angeles, are not unline the radii
of a circle, diverging at about an angle of
45 degrees, and the proposed line connect
ing them will thus form the arc.

1 enterprise, is a resident of Arizona, a man
of wealth and the representative of other
Eastern capitalists, all of whom seem to
have faitn in the growth and commercial
importance of Los Angeles.
Dr. Hineman recently had a conference
with T. E. Gibbon, vice-president of the
Terminal Railway, and it is now under
stood the Terminal Company is willing to
entertain a proposition looking to a traffic
or other arrangement which will facilitate
the execution of the plan as has been
roughly sketched.
J. Henry Dockweiler, formerly City En
gineer of Los Angeles, has been retained
by the Eastern capitalists to make plans
and otherwise assist the consummation of
the work, for which he is eminently fitted
by reason of His intimate acquaintance
with the country in this section. It seems
that for some time the work of surveying
has been quietly and carefully prosecuted,
and mord recently there have been meet
ings of importance ; held at .La Canada,
Glendale and Verdugo. Committees to
secure right of way, the probable * tonnage
to be : moved "and" Various statistics have
been actively at work for the past few
weeks.
The figures which show the traffic al
ready moving, notwithstanding the present
disabilities, have been secured. It should
be remembered that these figures are
actual, not merely "estimated." and they
are regarded as very favorable. It is re
ported that; the Eastern capitalists have
signified their desire and intention to
push the line speedily if the statistics ob
tained will insure the cose of â¢'axle-grease"
for. the first year.
â¢ Already there is no doubt in the mindÂ»
of interested parties that more than the
desired amount can be secured. There is
much enthusiasm in La Canada, and both
in the Valley and along the remainder of
the route the ranchers are up and doing.
At La Canada it was reported a few days
ago that rights of way had been granted
throughout the territory to be traversed.
Because of the present isolation, or
rather inaccessibility, of La Canada, there
are few people,: relatively, speaking, who
are acquainted with the smiling little val
ley nestled in the foothills of the Sierra
Madre, Mountains. But those. who have
strayed "among .'the hills,'' on ' a 'camping
expedition or sought the peaceful spot by
design, in f search 7of health or to purchase
fruit, are unanimous in singing the praises
of the 5 country, which reminds one of the
Happy Valley pictured by Dr. Johnson in
: "Ilasselas." ! :i ;r *:. :;v - ; '' :?: /;. '' ' â â¢":
The Sierra Madre â Mountains keep a
, solemn watch on the north, while the
Vendura Hills and the , San Fernando
Range protect the spot. on the sou.h. To
ward me east the mountains and the hills
join hands above the Arroyo at an altitude
of 1500 feet, as though j they were playing
"Open the gates as high as the sky to let
King George's men pass by." To the
west the land again rises in : a
similar but â - rather irregular man
ner, with here and there a hill
and . a knoll .' singing, "Thy Sentinel
Am L" The result of the whole config
uration is a double concave elliptical val
ley having an average width of two miles
and extending upward of ten miles to
within sight of San Fernando.
Above the Devil's Gate the Arroyo and
its sister chasm are spanned by two . ro
mantic bridges, where no doubt more than
two lovers have plighted their troth in
the moonlight.' A good road â¢ winds
around the bills above the bridges look
ing down on a vestibule basin which \is
the antechamber of La Canada. From
(iie elevated eastern entrance the road
cuts directly across the valley leading to
San Fernando, passing a trim school
house (attesting the ; intelligence of the
community).
'; At about the middle portion the valley
is tapped by another good road through
the Vendura Canyon, leading more or less
directly to Los Angeles, distant about
twelve miles. Along a portion of these
roads the electric line will pass, and even
if the project of joining the Terminal is
not carried out, it would not be a difficult
task to extend the line to Los Angeles
1 along the Verdugo road.
i La Canada being so high, there is little
difficulty in obtaining water of a good
quality, and thus the necessary factor for
reclaiming the land not already under
cultivation has been introduced and
awaits the - further enterprise of man to
blossom like the other ranches, where the
orange and lemon trees reward the energy
and industry already expended.
;It is worthy of note that the fruit
grown in La Canada commands a higher
price in the market than the oranges and
lemons grown in other sections immedi
ately tributary to Los : Angeles. This is
because ti.e fruit is bright and clean and
smooth, requiring no rehandling prepara
tory to shipment. No smut or soot ever
disturbs the trees, and the protection af
forded by the surrounding elevations
makes the land a stranger to frost, while
the altitude contributes a pure and brac
ing air. ;
This last quality makes the valley a de
sirable place for the invalid who would
escape the more accessible but crowded
health resorts .in this section. Already
people of wealth, who have had better
fortune than money can give, have dis
covered some of the benefits to be derived
from a residence in the "Happy Valley,"
with the result that architecture has con
tributed its talents to beautify the natural
grace of the land in the vicinity of "The
Castle."
The old Spanish names of the towns ana
landmarks between Los Angeles and La
Canada : are rich , with suggestions of
myths and legends about the doings of
the early Mexican and Spanish settlers of
California. ;â¢:;
Among the stories current are a few con
nected with the locality known as Eagle
Rock Valley. Eagle Kock, from which
the valley takes its name, is a huge per
pendicular stone which rears its solitary
head into a commanding view o< the sur
rounding country, making clear the valley
lying at tbe foot of the rugged San Fer
nando peaks, and eastward the San Gab
riel Valley fringed by the Sierra Madre
Mountains, with Old Baldy a jewel in the
center.
In Eagle Rock itself either art or nature
or both have carved two caves, which at a
distance strongly resemble the out
stretched wings of the bird of freedom,
and it would be most appropriate and
gratifying to behold "Old Glory" swing
ing its folds to the breeze on the pinnacle.
One of the caves in the rock, if not both,
gave a home to a hermit in the old days,
if not refuge to those of a less peaceful
nature. It is certain, however, that the
little knoll at the opposite end of the
valley known as "Robber's Roost" and
now marked by the site of a ruined adobe
is the location of more than one scene of
riotous pleasure and act of violence. But
at the present day, peaceful and happy
homes and smiling ranchers tell a more
pleasing though les3 romantic tale. And
this territory, too, will share in the ad
vantages to be obtained from the pro
posed electric road, especially if the
VerJugo Canyon road is utilized instead
of the Terminal Railway. If the latter,
then of course the benefits will be less di
rect, though not to be ignored. Several
important meetings were held last Satur
day, and some of the parties most promi
nently connected with the movement left
for San Francisco to make arrangement!
which will further the project.
The Arabs have a superstition that the
stork has a human heart. When one of
these birds builds its nest upon a house
top they believe the happiness of that
household is insured for a year.

THE STAGE
"The Prisoner of Zenda" is a fascinating
drama, buÂ» I believe that nine spectators
out of every ten go home from It with a
hungry, unsatisfied yearning â not for
more "Zenda" (the play is already in four
acts and a prologue), but they want the
curtain to ring down on a more satisfac
tory conclusion.
Edward Rose has developed the love
making scenes between Princess Flavia
and her handsome impostor to as great a
length as Wagnerian love duos. Flavia
loves Rudolph; Rudolph loves Flavia.
She looks love into his eyes and he looks
love into hers, and the linked sweetness,
long drawn out, is so pretty and poetical
that the audience escapes by a hair's
breadth from being nauseated. But after
playing old gooseberry for so long people
are sent home with a vision of the lovers
torn apart forever. All the good love
making lost, and for the sake of what,
pray? Not even for the drunken, de
graded cousin. Once on the throne he
could have let Flavia go away with her
tourist. It is for the sake of the People â
with a capital P â the nation of Ruritania,
that pretty, red-haired Flavia is separated
from the hero she has loved through three
acts and is given to a drunken brute she
despises. "Hang the people!" your aver
age spectator wants to say. "They're not
in the play and I don't care what becomes
of them."
That's the selfishness of the average
theater-goer. Novel readers can swallow
tons of self-sacrifice for the sake of mere
abstractions, but the theater-goer refuses
to feel the least sympathy for what he
does not see with his own eyes and hear
with bis own ears. It is a beautiful idea â
in a novel â this nnselfish devotion of
Flavia to her people. The people's inter
ests are as much above those of the indi
vidual as patriotism is above mere per
sonal advancement, and in a novel, with
the help of description, we can realize it
ail, but in a play, bah ! we none of us have
enough imagination.
I don't think any other ending was
possible in "The Prisoner of Zenda," but
lhat does not prevent the denouement
from being apainst our theater - going
ethics. In a play we want to see the
Heroine's fate settled, either in the bonds
of holy matrimony, or else beneath the
sod. We can go home rejoicing when she
is led to the altar by the right man, and
we can take a grim satisfaction in seeing
.her stabbed, or poisoned, or burned to
death. But expect us to go home happy
when she is about to marry a weak
minded fool? No, Mr. Rose, we have not
fortitude enough to enjoy the sacrifice,
even for the sake of the people â with a
capital P-
But Hope and Rose have made a de
jightfnl play, if they do ask us to sympa
thize with an abstraction. They have
taken us back to the realms of romance,
out of which fin-de-siecle realists, with
their commonplace immorality, have
been trying so hard to banish us. There
may Dot be much romarice in our poor
workaday world, but we like sometimes
to dream idly that there is.
The theatrical welkin has been ringing
for a week with praise of Hackett's re
marKable versatility and his physical
charms. With that length of limb, dash
of manner and tenderness in love-making,
his doom as a matinee girl's idol is already
sealed. I nope he won't grow vain and
puffed up. They say he is a very nice
youth at present â he is on the right side
of 25 â and if he keeps his head he ought
to have a great future.
Could Rose have had a sneaking desire
to compose a grand opera when he
adapted "The Prisoner of Zenda" for stage
purposes? Something to out -Massenet
the "Navarraise" which takes the cake for
lots of noise and start;? ng accompaniment ?
Jf so, he has followed the Wagnerian
tradition of concealing the people who
pake this music, but there must be at
least a score of them behind the scenes
actively engaged in executing the "noises
without," which occur continually in
Rose's stage directions. No sooner is the
curtain up than night is made hideous by
midnight revelers brawling in chorus
without. Directly after a carriage is heard
rattling over cobblestones that make
Market street seem paved with velvet by
comparison. With much labored noise
the vehicle departs and Amelia Rassendyll
begins a laugh without, so long and so
sustained that a hyena's vocal efforts
would fade into little staccato interjec
tions compared with it. The rest of the
play is given to an accompaniment of
bands, shouting, hurrahing, national
anthem, storm, with thunder and light
ning, bells ringing, swords clashing, battle
raging, more shouting and more hurrah
ing, and the whole of the final scene is
gone through to the strains of a prolonged
dirge and the tolling of the passing bell
for the defunct Black Elphberg. It was
all very effective, but the tax on the
actors' lungs and voices would have been
relieved if they had burst into recitative.
Luckily most of them are blessed with
strong lungs, and can defy the tumult;
all but Miss Odell, whose voice is too
leggero for grand opera. Poor Miss Odell !
at times she has to labor to be heard till
the veins stand out on her neck like bits
of whipcord.
'La, la, la." This little interjection was
the crowning joy of "Trilby" audiences in
Martinetti'i time. Thp orchestra chuckled,
tlie family circle bubbled over with delight
and the gallery cried for more "La, la, la."
But alas! "When other iips," etc., and
the Trader lips are not framed on the
French model. We remember you, wicked
little Martinetti, when we see Mr. Trader
wearing your Zouave bloomers and giving
us '"La, la, la." His zou-zou is a sDorty
little American, who has never been to
Paris, not even on a cheap excursion â re
turn ticket, available for a month. As for
the chic and elan of the seasoned bouie
vardie â "La, la, la."
Speaking for my own part, I never could
see the fascination of Wilton Lackaye's
Svengali. He was too fat and flabby for
the role; his face was pasty and his hands
â the salient point in a hypnotist â were
as expressionless as two strings of sau
sages. His characterization was melo
dramatic and intense enough, but was
ghoulishly inhuman. Now, speaking for
my own part, I like Charles Kent in the
role much better. He is naturally built
on Svengali lines, has a lean and hungry
look and bis long, claw-like hands are
eloquently expressive. His conception of
the character is more bnrnan and possible 1
than Wilton Lackaye's and, best of all, he
understands and effectively expresses the
grim, saturnine humor which Dv Maurier
gave Svengali. Wilton Lackaye's Sven
gali had no more mirth than a cow.
"Trilby" has experienced a good many
changes in the cast since it was here last,
and much of the glory of the studio scene
has departed ; but given the new Svengali,
I like "Trilby 1 " better than of yoreâ if
the stage manager could but be persuaded
to abandon the ridiculous given calcium
light, with which the hypnotist's footsteps
are dogged all over thefstage.
Miss Edith Crane has come back from
Australia with a buxom air of blooming
health and a habit of making her head
quaver Jike an aspen leaf, that would lead
one at first sight to fear mat she had con
tracted the palsy. It is impossible, how
ever, that much hypnotizing can have
given the handsome young actress such a
dread disease; her very appearance, which
is blooming as that of a rose, soothes
all anxiety on that score. I suppose
Miss Crane thinks shaking her head
is an effective way of expressing
violent emotion, but a Jittle of
that sort of thing Â«oes a long way. I own
that it is a very difficult feat, a sort of pro
longed trill of the cranium, that would
send an ordinary woman to a darkened
room, to mop her aching brows with eau
de cologne. But Miss Crane seems to have
learned the art of continually wriggling
her head without suffering any after incon
venience, and she is so proud of her ac
complishment that she "does it and does
it again." It's very difficult. I wish it
were impossible.

Mabie Evelyn.
Qreerxroom Gossip.
She was a tall, distinguished young
woman, with fluffy blonde hair, and she
sailed up to Ferris Hartman the morning
| of the first rehearsal of "Babes in the
Wood," and said:
"Mr. Hartman, I am engaged dv the Ti
voli management to play prima donna
roles."
"Indeed," replied Ferris, politely lifting
his hat and casting a sidelong glance at
the cast of characters he held in his hand.
"You are? Ahem."
"Engaged as prima donna assoluta."
"Certainly, madame," said the come
dian, smiling inwardly as he saw that no
stranger was in the cast, "will you sing
here, please?" and he placed the aspiring
blonde among ti.e chorus girls.
For three days she warbled contentedly
among the damsels who do amazon
marches at the Tivoli. On the morning of
the fourth day she sailed up to Hartman
and asked him majestically: "Is this the
prima donna part that I'm playing, Mr.
Hartman?"
"No, madams, it is not," said Ferris
deprecatingly.
"What part is itf '
"Not any part. Yon are singing in the
chorus."
"The chorus!" gasped the blonde,
clutching at some of the scenery for sup
port. "I have been tricked into singing
in the chorus!" And then, drawing her
self ap proudly, she cried, "I wish you
good-day, Mr. Hartman," and sailed out
of the theater.
"And she h*s never been back again,"
said Ferris Hartman yesterday. "I have
not the least idea who she was. There
were a lot of new faces in the chorus when
I came back from my vacation, but what
on earth made that young woman think
she had been engaged as prima dorma â it
beats me."
Baldwin Jheater.
Only one more week remains of "The
Prisoner of Zenda" at the Baldwin
Theater.
On Monday evening, October 19, Julia
Marlowe TaDer and .Robert Taber be^in a
three-weeks' ensapement. They will open
in a new play, "Romola," fo/inded on
George Eliot's novel and written by
Elwyn A. Barron.
Every one knows that in her famous
Italian story George Eliot has paid little
attention to the mere development of the
plot; he has dealt in a bro.-id and virile
manner with the development of the
characters, particularly tiiose of the glit
tering but delusive Tito and the sensitive
noble Roraola.
It is said tnat the dramatist has suc
ceeded in transferring these characters to
his play very much as the novelist con
ceived them, and they doubtless afford
ample scope for the display of talent on
the part of the accomplished Julia Mar
lowe Taber and Robert, her husband.
Columbia Theater.
The last week of "Triby" opens at the
Columbia Theater to-morrow night. Al
though on its return visit, the play drew
large houses last week.
The new farce-comedy, "Town Topics,"
will be presented at the Columbia Theater
after "Trilby" by the Broadway Comedi
ans. It ik in three acts, interspersed with
specialties introduced by a chosen lot ot
furce-comedy people. Among the com
pany are William Keller, William H.
Mack, John Queen, James Tcnbrook,
Puillip Ott, Joseph Harrington, William
Nelson, Frank Caverly, A. M. Miller, Be
atrice Norman, Nellie Sennett, Lylian
Heckler, Luella Miller, Elise Nugent,
Laura Wainsford, Freda Peel and Mamie
Welty.
/U the Alcazar.
To-morrow evening the company at the
Alcazar will present Horace Wigan's play,
"The Wife's Peril." This is an emotional
drama, in which the strong human pas
sions are exemplified. It has not been
seen here for some years. Mrs. Langtry
made her first success in the piece. Friend
ship is the mainspring of the action.
The cast includes all the favorites, Sul
livan, Doane, Polk, May Buckley, Beatrice
Lieb and Miss Bates.
"The Wife's Peril" will be followed by
"An Ugly Duckling," connected with the
famous Belasco-Fairbanks suit in New
York and about which so much curiosity
was aroused. This will be its first repre
sentation here.
Qrand Opera-J-lous c.
L. R. block .veil is to close his engage
ment at the Grand this week with "Uncle
Tom's Cabin," in which he will act his
part of "Marks, tliÂ« Lawyer." The play
will also serve to introduce to fcforosco's
patrons Waller Fessler, the new "viillain,"
who is to appear as Simon Legree. Little
Mildred has been specially engaged for
this performance to play Eva.
Much is expected of Lottie Williams
as Toppy. In the plantation scenes there
will be jubilee singers and champion
dancers. There will also bti the usual ac
companiment of bloodhounds, a trick
donkey and an elaborate apotteosis when
the angels will be sbown carrying little
Eva through the "Gates Ajar."
Ji\toli Opera-House.
The comic opera season at the Tivoli
Opera-house will be inaugurated to-mor
row evening with a presentation of a new
spectacular operatic burlesque in three
acts, entitled "The Babes in the Woods."
Ferris Hartman, the popular comedian,
found time, during the intervals in his
fishing this summer, to write this new
and very much up-to-date version of the
fairy taie. His work is a hodge-podge of
local events, and some of the latest songs
received from the East and London. The
topics of local interest include a good deal
about a famous will case and a parade of
the young Jadies of the chorus in the cos
tunips of San Francisco bicycling clubs.
Miss Lilly Post, a primi donna well
known In this City, will make her reap
pearance in this work. The rest of the
cast will include: Elvira Crox Seabrooke
and Maurice Darcy as Tommy and Sally,
the two poor little rich babes; John J.
Raffael and Bernice Holmes, as Lord and
Lady Macasser; Ferris Hartman as Weary
Willie, and Dusty Roads, his partner, will
be portrayed by W. H. West; Rtiys
Thomas as the Doctor; W. H. Tooker as
the school director known as Uncle Josh.
Special scenery and costumes have been
made for "The Babes in the Wood."
/U the Orpheum.
The Hawaiian Band and Glee Club have
proved such pleasing offerings to Orpheum
audiences that Gustave Walter has re-en
gaged them for another week before let
ting them depart for their island borne.
The Mengler sisters, who are said to be
a remarkable pair of soubrettes, make their
debut at the Orpheum to-morrow, direct
from the Alhambra Theater, London.
The Lucifers also make their appear
ance this week, and some very funny work
is expected from them. They are acro
bats and manage to do all their
athletic feats in a way that provokes
laughter. Ando, Omne and Little Al
ricnt are a trio of Japs who are expected
to do some very clever juggling, balancing
and sleighr-of-hand irickn. C. H. Unthan
has been retained and will perform more
wonders for a man born without hands.
Gertie Cochran will also remain, and
Master Waiter Leon has new imitations to
Â»render. Riley and Hughes, the planta
tion dancers, are also to be held over.
y\t the Ghutes.
Enthusiasm on the subject of shooting
the chutes is still unabated, as the attend
ance at this Haight-street resort on fine
days attests. The performances of Pirri,
the demon bicyclist, and Vosmer, the
aeronaut, are enjoyed by all. The man
agement will shortly add other attractions
to their list; Peary's north pole expedi
tion, in miniature, will soon be seen, and
also the famous gold piano, which won
the prizes at the World's Fair and the
Midwinter exposition. On Monday next
a six-day bicycle contest will commence
between picked men from the San Fran
cisco Road Club and the California Cycling
Club. The winning club will be awarded
a silver cup, and three other prizes will be
given to the best individual riders.

A California Actress.
Miss Anna Daly, the clever young California actiess, is about to leave for tbe East
to join Rose Coghlan's company in New York for a tour of the Southern States,
which begins November L Next Thursday evening a farewell benefit performance
will be tendered Miss Daly in Native Sons' Hall, on Mason street. It is expected that
Miss Italy's many friends will rally in forco to say good-by to the yountr actress, who
has always so cheerfully given her talent and energies in the cause of local charity.
Mis 3 Anna Daly won the admiration of the Rose Coghlan Company, as well as of the
San Francisco public, when she appeared as Mercedes, at the California Theater, last
summer in a dramatization of "Carmen." Her work showed such remarkable grace
and ability for a debutante that Miss Rose Coghlan decided at once to secure the
young Californian's services for her next tour.

James K. Hackett is delighted with the
Baldwin management's enterprise in try
ing to squelch the theater hat. He Bays
he has sat in audiences himself, and has
sadly realized the need of such a reform.
"In New York," said Mr. Hackett, "all
the best theaters have managed to sup
press the hat, for I have noticed lately
that the ladies sit during the perform
ances either without hats or with very
small bonnets. The next time I play in
San Francisco I fully expect that the femi
nine portion of the audience will be minus
the much-discussed theater hat."
"Oh! take 'em oft," exclaimed Jennie,
the genial Mme. Vinard, of "Trilby"
fame. "I sat behind a lady the other day,
in one of your San Francisco theaters, and
she had on a regular cart wheel. 'Will
you please take off your hat, or change
seats with me?' I said to her â and she took
it off. I wish they'd do here as they do in
Australia. However poor the women are,
they take off their hats. Even tbe little
girl in the gallery never sits with anything
on her head. There was a touching' thing
happened in Melbourne, at our farewell
performance. The crush was immense.
One woman had gone to the gallery in a
fine new theater hat, which she took off
during the play. She was so jammed by
tbe people going out, that she could not
get it on again, the hat was trampled
under foot, and the poor lady had to go
home without anything on her head. Yes,
that's a case I heard of personally, and it's
just one instance of virtue not being re
warded."
L. R. Stockwell says that an actor may
not be able to see the theater hats from
the stage, but he can feel the restlessness
of the audience, caused by unsuccessful
efforts to peer at him round the obstruc
tive millinery. "I don't mind little hats
in the theater, they do not obstruct things
much, but big hats certainly react on the
performers. I believe in time the
ladies here will do as they have done in
New York â take the big hat off. Last
winter I was in New York for six months,
and noticed that even at matinees, where
there was no sort of full dress, the ladies
removed their hats. They were good
natured about it, too. One day at the
American Theater, I remember overhear
ing a lady, who was behind a big hat say,
'Just my luck to get behind that.' The
lady who was wearinz it at once turned
round and said: 'Why if it annoys you,
madam, Til take it off.' That is what I
call being amiable."
Lew Hawkins, the colored monologue
artist, has pondered long and deeply on
the subject of theater hats. He says he
first gave his attention to them during a
tour through New England with Prim
rose & West's Minstrels. "Big hats were
all the go just then, and I often saw that
people in the audience who were hidden
behind them would get mad because they
could not see anything and go out in the
middle of the performance. This is what
I'd do if I owned a theater: I would block
out a part of it for big hats, and all the
ladie-t who wore them would have to sit
there and right it out among themselves.

suggestion were carried out a gentleman
who took a lady in a big hat would have
to suffer along with her. A peivleman is
not supposed to find any fault; hedaresn't
find any faun, but the second iimÂ« he
went into the place reserved for bie hats
he'd insist on seeing: some of the perform
ance himself." Mr. Hawkins added he
had one other idea, but he feared it was
not a profitable one. "You might build a
theater expressly for big hats, but there 'd
be no money in it," he said, shaking his
head pensively. "I have figured it out,
and i ieel quite sure that notuing bat the
front rows would ever be sold."
"If you are in a box and the gentlemen
behind you like to stand up it's all right,"
said Elvira Crox Seabrooke, the Tivoli's
new soubrette, "but otherwise nobody
witn any respect for any one else would
wear one. The theater hat is dead irÂ» the
East. Frohman's Theater won't p.ljow ie
within their walls. I have not worn a hat
myself in the theater for six years. I was
engaged for three months this year at the
Summer Garden in Clevpland, Ohio. It is
ir. the open air, but no smokine i* allowed.
Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays were
the swell nights, and very fsjshionable
people go. Even there the ladies take off
their hats," and Mrs. Seabrooke laid a
perceptible stress on the word "ladies 11
which plainly intimated that vi her opin
ion the people "who hhd no respect for
any one else" are not to be included in
that category.
Gertie Cochran, the six-year-old memory
wonder at the Orpheum, has very pro
nounced views on the theater hat. "Those
great big things, with roses standing
straight up and feathers zoxdr every way?**
asked the phenomenon, waving her short
arms like a semaphore, in a vain effort to
indicate the geometrical proportions of
the reai theater hat. "Oh ! I would not
go to the theater in one of those things,
and I wouldn't let my dolly go, either,"
and Miss Cochran implanted a chaste kiss
on the china brow of "Trilby," her latest
and most cherished possession, "I'll just
show yon what I wear myself when I go
to the' theater, and Trilby is gome to have
one, too." The phenomenon bopped upon
a chair, and by standing on her tiptoes
was just able to reach from a hook a tiny
netted hood of red s:lk. She smooched
down her tumbled curls, carefully ad
justed the close-fitting bit of netting to
her head, and, tying the strings under her
chin, remarked, naively, "That's my
theater hat."THE COMMERCIAL WORLD.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lit., Oct. 10.â Wheat scored another
advance this morning, the speculative sentiment
having undergone no change daring the holiday
recess. A moment's Indecision appeared at the
opening, but the demand asserted its supremacy
and prices rose ly^c during the first thirty mln
utet. The exports for the week, 4,050,000 bash
els, struck the speculative mind as being a favor
able argument, and shortly after trading began
advices from Australia of crop damage by hot
winds added emphasis to the bullish tone. Liver
pool cables were unchanged from yesterday, or
y 2 d bigbrr than Thursday.
i-ieceipts in the Northwest were 1026, azalnst
1774 a year ago. Chicago bad 321 cars. There
was no wheat taken from store. Argentine shp
ments week were 48,000 bushels. On realiz
ing combined with some short selling, the market
was f reed to relax in fusion, the greater part of
the ear: y advance being lost beiore the close.
Closing Paris cables were higher, Berlin lower
and Antwerp unchanged. Atlantic seaboard clear
ances for two days were heavy at 952.687 bushels.

FORESTS MAY BE
OF NATIONAL USE
Government Inspection of
Pacific Coast Timber
at an End.
Commission Leaves to Prepare
Its Report on Status
and Needs.
JOHN MUIR WANTS A POLICY.
The Veteran Devotee of California
Wooded Hills and Dales Be
speaks Popular Interest.
"While I am not authorized to give oat
the Commissioners' report, I violate no
confidence in saying that all the Commis
sioners are agreed that an administrative
policy governing the forests of the United
States is urgently require I. The forests
mast not only be preserved but used. They
may be made to constitute a perennial
National supply of immense value, where
as now â "
John Muir, the veteran tree-lever and
California natural wonder writer, was
speaking yesterday on the important sub
ject of National forests. He had just re
turned from an extended trio with the Na
tional Forestry Commission throughout
the Western States, the Commissioners
having traveled unweariedly to all the
largest timber belts, and being now on
their way home to the East, where next
week they will meet to prepare an ex
haustive report
The Commissioners were men of
National repute and included: Professor
C. S. Sargent (chairman) of Harvard Uni
versity; Professor Brewer of Yale, a
botanist, and famed for nis connection
with the old Whitney geological survey;
General H. Abbott, connected with the
railway surveys in the Cascades in earJy
times and with the building of the great
levees along the Mississippi Kiver; Dr.
Arnold Hague, United States geologist,
perhaps best ksjown for his work in
Yellowstone Park; Gifford
(secretary), who has made forestry a pro
fession, having been placed In charge of j
Vanderbilt's property, "Billmore," in
North Carolina, which he is managing on
European lines; Professor Alexander'
Agassiz, son of the famous professor, but
who was not able to accompany the party.
John Muir is not a member of the com
mission, but was invited to accompany it j
as a local expert. He felt he bad been j
fighting for the forests pretty nearly alone I
for long enough and gladly jumped at the
chance of such material assistance as the
commission offered.
Trie commission and Mr. 'Muir met in
Chicago on July 2 and almost immedi
ately started on their long trip of inspec- !
tion, the idea being to cover as much j
ground as possible, while not neglecting
any point of importance.
The pany first visited the Black Hills,
South Dakota, the epithet "black" being
caused by their appearance at a distance
owing to a covering of yellow pine. Here,
as at all other points, the Commissioners
investigated existing conditions to devise
the best means for the preservation of
the trees.
Thence they went on to Yellowstone
Park and the forests adjacent; thence
north through Montana to the forests on
the headwaters of the Flathead River;
thence to the head of the Kootenay River;
down to Spokane Falls; back along the
Northern Pacific road to Missoula, where
the Anaconda mills are working, taking
in the Wind River and Blue Mountains
in Idauo, and so on through the forests of
Oregon and Washington into the region
about Mount Rainier and the wild and
little-known region of the Olympic Moun
tains.
Thence the little party of foresters
journeyed to Ashland and by private team
to the wonderful Crater take country,
comprising a reserve of 5,000,000 acres,
being the largest of all reservations pro
claimed by Cleveland.
Returning by a different route past
Crater Lake, the Commissioners went to
Grants Pass on the railroad, and thence
down by private conveyance to tbe coast
by Rogue River and Smith valeys, visit
ing Crescent City and the Del None coun
try, and so reached what they considered
tbe most important of the coast timber
belts, vis.: tbe redwoods.
From Crescent City the party traveled
southward along the coast by private team
to Eureka and thence by branch railroad
to Scotia, on Eel River, whence some of
the Commissioners came down to this City
by steamer and otaers by stage through
tbe redwoods to Ukiah and thence to San
Francisco by rail.
In this City tbe alleged grievances of
timber-claim speculators along the Tuol
umne were listened to, and then the com
mission continued its inspection. One
party branched out to tbe Mount Shasta
region and another through the Yosemite
and Kings Canyon; another through the
Santa Lucia range, 250 miles soutn, strik
ing up to the Sequoia National Park, and
again south to the San Gabriel and San
Bernardino reserves to the San Jacinto
Mountains and on to look over the Grand
Canyon of ..the Colorado reserve in Ari
zona.'
"At this point," said Mr. Muir, "I
turned back toward home, leaving the
Commissioners to spend a week in the
Colorado reserves and afterward to go
East to prepare a report that promises to
be of special interest
â¦'The United States is in a peculiar di
lerama just now as regards its forests. A
few of us have secured protection for four
National parK.-, including the Yellow
stone, Yosemite, General Grant and Se
quoia. There are also seventeen reseiva
tions which are protected to a certain
extent by proclamation and posting of
rules by the Government, but something
more than a paper stuck on a tree is re
quired to keep off sheepmen and other
undesirable characters.
"Tie chief objection to the present lack
of system is twofold. The forests are not
preserved and the timber on tbe reserva
tions is not available for use. What w*
want is a definite administrative policy by
which we could regulate the preservation
and use of these valuable timber belts.
They might insure us a proper water sup
ply as well as furnish us* timber of a vast
National value.
"All the Commissioners are of one mind
concerning the urgency of immediate
steps. A few blue-coats with muskets
about a reserve work marvels, and a little
system as to timber cutting and planting
would mean incalculable millions to this
country. Untold damage has been done
by ignorance and avarice, but not more
than can be remedied by a wise policy.
"I hope the people and press will take
up the matter and, should the recom
mendations of the Commissioners be feasi
ble, insist upon their immediate adoption.
The wealth as well as the beauty of the
country depends on it."

HERE IS A HOUSE
WITHOUT WALLS
Newhall's Strip of Realty
in the Heart of
the City.
Was the Rendezvous of Mil-
lionaires in the Old
Comstock Days.
TOO DIMINUTIVE FOR USE.
The Place Where Lonis Eppinger
Made Many Fortunes Only to
Lcse Them Again.
There is a little piece of real estate with
only a nfteen-foot frontage on Halleck
street, worth thousands of dollars, and
with which the owner knows not what
to do.
It is an historical spot, surrounded by
others of a like nature, and crowded with
memories of a past when Leidesdorff street
was not known as "pauper alley," and its
intersection with Hal leek street was the
rendezvous of the mining kings of the
Comstock.
When William O'Brien, John W.
Mackay, Archie Borland, Alvinza Hay
ward, Jim Keane and other speculators of
their class had time to eat it was on Hal
leck street they met at noontime and nib
bled at the free lunch served in Louis Ep
pinger's place, buying and selling each
other thousands of dollars worth of stocks
between bites.
Well, Eppinger'a place was on the now
vacant 15-foot lot owned by W. N. New
nail. The saloon was too small for its
patronage, and Eppinger made the mis
take of his life in quitting and establish
ing himself across the way in what was
then the most extravagantly fitted up
saloon in this City. It cost $15,000 to make
the place the handsomest in San Fran
cisco. That was about twenty-two years
ago, and from all over the State people
flocked to see it.
In the meantime the old Eppinger house
was taken by some other fellow, and, more
as a matter of routine than anything else,
the trade ke, t pouring in there.
Eppinger became a bankrupt, and so did
others who succeeded him, while the old
stand kept on making wealthy men of its
successive proprietors.
But the old saloon was terribly in need
of repairs and was perpetually threaten
ing to collapse. Finally a contractor by
the name of A. A. Snyder undertook to
remodel the place and put on a second
story, which he did. To retain the full
frontage of the place, however, Snyder
found it impossible to furnish his building
with side walls, so be utilized tbe outer
wall of the old American Exchange Hotel
on the east and the wall of Matt Kerr's
building on the west. All he did, there
fore, was to put down the floorings and a
roof and rear wall with a few uprights.
Snyder Ivmself lived in the rooms up
stairs, where, as history goes, he was
nearly killed by an itate husband, whose
divorced wife he subsequently married.
The 15-ojol saloon ultimately passed
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1896.
The Little Lot on Hallecfc Street
into the hands of a man named Pereira,
who called it the Bureau, and for the past
twelve years it continued a mint for its
owner.
There is an end to all things, and there
was to this old rendezvous. Some months
ago Jacob Steam of Levi Strauss & Co.
concluded he would tear down the old
American Exchange Hotel, a landmark
by itself, and erect upon its site a grand
iron and stone store building. When the
work of demolition leveled the westerly
wall it likewise carried away the Bureau's
easterly wall and left the cozy little sa
loon's interior open to the world.
The Bureau closed its front doors, and
it in turn was torn down, leaving the va
cant lot which now stands between the
two high buildings â almost a complete
house without walla.
In speaking of the space yesterday one
of the Newhall brothers declared be did
not know to what use his elder brother,
who is the actual owner of it, could put it
to.
"It is only fifteen feet wide," he said;
"just about a .ood size for an elevator."
Jacob Steam is in Europe, but his part*
ncr, Levi Strauss, stated that he was sure
Steam could do without Newnall's fifteen
foot lot, as the new building he in erecting
is amply large enough, being 61x125 feet
in dimensions. Still he thought when
Steam returns the extra ground might be
purchased to make a rear entrauce to the
building.
Fur Obstructing the Mails.
Bern&dino Gampoli, charged with obstruct
ing the mails, had his preliminary hearing
before United States Commisiioner Haacock
on Friday. He was released on $200 bail,
pending definite action by the Grand Jury.
From the evidence introduced it appears that
Gampoli deliberately obstructed the mailcars
for a distance of 800 feet, causing a loss of
time of over three minutes.
Oriental Artistic Spoilt.
Within the last few days there has ar
rived in San Francisco from Armenia,
Turkey and Persia what is perhaps the
most notable collection of rngs, carpets
and other evidences of Oriental art that
has ever been brought to this City. It is
an unusually magnificent lot, and was im
ported by the Turkish Rug Co., 324 Sutter
street, one of the best-known firms deal
ing in Oriental stuffs in America. It has
been determined to dispose of the entire
collection at once, and to that end sales
will be held daily after to-day at 119 Mont
gomery street, where the collection may
be seen.

IMPOSING COLLEGE
AT MENLO PARK
Madames of the Sacred
Heart Preparing to
Build at Once.
It Will Be One of the Largest
Colleges in the State ot
California.
BRICK AND STONE QUADK ANGLE
Bids for Building the Magnificent
Structure Will Soon Be
Given Out.
An educational establishment on a mag
nificent scale is to be opened at Menlo
Park by the Madames of the Sacred Heart.
According to the plans already com
pleted this college will rival, if not in
deed exceed, in the extent and style of its
imposing buildings all other colleges in
California, the universities excepted. The
purpose of its builders is to have a hand
some pile of buildings complete in ap
pointments and modern appliances and
of fine architectural proportions. When
finished it will be occupied by the Ma
dames, who will then direct their en
deavors to establishing a college for young
ladies in keeping with the high standard
which has made tbe houses of this order
in France famous throughout Europe.
The local community of the order has
been established in San Francisco for
about nine years, most of the time in the
academy and convent at Franklin and
Ellis streets, where daughters of some of
the best families in town have been edu
cated.
The progress of the Madames here has
been one of continued success. Families
knowing their reputation as teachers, par
ticularly in the higher branches and iiner
accomplishments, prevailed on the lady
superior to accommodate pupils, and in
that way a boarding-school was opened,
though the intention was to have only a
select day school. With the succeeding
years applications came in from a con
stantly widening field and with increasing
frequency, until now the academy on
Franklin street has boarders from Central
America, Mexico, British Columbia and
nearly all of the Pacific Coast States.
Eventually it was seen that a new and
far more commodious house was an
absolute necessity if the order would keep
pace in accommodations with its increas
ing popularity among wealthy people,
who were anxious that their daughters
should receive an education from the
Madames. A suitable site ior such a col
lege was sought, with tbe result that a
tract in Menlo Part has been purchased.
The spot where the college will be
erected faces Valparaiso avenue, on the
north side of the Southern Pacific Rail
way and a short distance from the
new theological seminary. It was bought
from the Athertons recently for a good
round sura, as the grounds are extensive
and very valuable owing to the favorable
location. Orchards and gardens and
flower nurseries surround the site, and
the prevailing climate at that particular
point is well known to be all that could be
desired, even in California itself. Those
who inspected the land say it is an ideal
place for an educational institution for
young ladies. Stanford University is but
fifteen minutes' drive toward the San
Mateo foothils, and on all sides are the
country homes of San Francisco mil
lionaires.
The grounds have been planted in fruit
trees; hedges have been sowed and orna
mental trees set out, so that by the time
the building is ready for occupying there
will be a beautiful park and orchard fairly
well started. Construction will not inter
fere with the trees or shribs, as an open
space large enough for all purposes of the
builders has been left where the college is
to stand.
Excavations for the foundations have
been in progress for some time past, and,
in fact, specifications for bids for building
are now in readiness for contractors to
make estimates upon them. The lady
superior stated yesterday that bids on the
work will be asked at once.
"We have concluded to erect a building
of quadrangular form, inclosing a large
courtyard. The plans have been sent to
Paris to be submitted to the head of our
order there. 'They have been approvtd,
but are still in Paris. However, we ex
pect to receive them back immediately
and will then beam the work of construc
tion. Some slight changes have been
made in them, but the general plan re
mains the same. We intend to build only
one wing now and iater on to finish the
college as we need more room. The first
wing to be built will contain the working
department of the collegeâthat is, the
laundry, kitchen, etc. As the building
will be a very expensive one, we must
take our time about finishing it. The
three remaining wings to be built are the
front and sides. And after they are occu
pied we shall build a chapel outside the
building and opposite one of the side
wings."
The new college will be built of red
brick and stone, and as well as a hand
some exterior it will be finished in the in
terior without much regard for expense,
as the aim is to have a splendid house in
which young ladies accustomed to lux
urious homes can find every comfort.
Just as soon as the plans are received
from Paris, bids will be asked for the first
wing, ana then work will commence.
When it is occupied as a boarding college
a change will be made in the local
academy, which will then be a day school
exclusively.
"The Finest" Go Down to Posterity.
During the parade of the police force on
Thursday last Colonel Marceau photographed
the entire body from an elevation of fifteen
feet, at the corner of Hayes street and Van
Ness avenue. Subsequently Bushnell the pho
tographer took the portraits of the individuals
at the head of the department. Chief Crowley
was furnished with the proofs Friday after
noon.
