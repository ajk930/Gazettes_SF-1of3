MAy ASIST McKINLEY.
Humor That Oen*ral Harrison May lie
Attkrd to Act aa Frr.mler.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 9.â A Sun
6pecial from Washington says: Politicians
and public men generally in Washington
appear to agree in the opinion that Presi
dent-elect McKinley has already deter
mined to offer ex-President Hnrrison a
place in his Cabinet. This honor, it was
thought, is due to General Harrison be
cause of his high standing in the party
and his reputation as a citizen.
Moreover, the fact that he personally
conducted the affairs of the State Denart
mentduring his administration, especially
after the death of Mr. Blalne, demon
strates bis ability as an international
lawyer and diplomat. In the Chilean and
Hawaiian affairs Harrison held the reins
in his own hands and made personal an
nouncement of the various steps la the
vigorous anu patriotic American policy
that was adopted.
The possibility of General Harrison's
appointment as Secretary of Statj has
aroused much gossip over the interesting
point of whether the proprieties of mod
ern statesmanship and politics would allow
an ex-President of the United States to
become a Cabinet Minister.
The consensus of opinion in Washington
seems to be that General Harrison's dig
nity would not suffer in the least by his
consÂ«nt to become the Premier of the
McKinley administration. Nothing is
known here, however, as to General Har
rison's personal inclinations beyond the
fact that he has repeatedly said to his
friends that he now desired to spend a few
years at least at the practice of law for the
] urpose of making money and at the same
time find leisure for reading and study.
L His recent murriasre will undoubtedly
xiave considerable influence upon his fu
ture plans, however, und if President Mc-
Kinley should offer htm a place in the
Cabinet Mrs. Harrison's wishes might de
termine whether He would accept.
There are very few political leaders here
at present, but among inose who are here
The San Francisco Call
the opinion seems to be general that Presi- \
dent McKinley will recognize the services j
of Senator Palmer, Secretary Carlisle,
General Buckner aud others, who will all
be out of office after March 4 if Carlisle is j
not elected Senator from Kentuck}*, in a !
manner satisfactory to them. A well-in
formed Republican politician said yester
day that in the opinion of the old soldiers,
without regard to party. President Mc-
Kinley could make no more popular ap
pointment and no more deserving one
than that of General Daniel E. Sickles to
be Commissioner of Pensions. This is an
opinion In which old soldiers and sailors
only are greatly interested, and General
Sicfcles' appointment, it is thought, would
be as gratifying to the veterans as was
that of Corporal Tanner by President
Harrison.
MAJOR McKINLEY ACTIVE
Take* a Long Walk and Wade* Through
the Jiewtpopfira.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 9.âPresident
elect McKinley has so far recovered â¢ from .
the fatigue incident upon the labors of the
campaign just closed, â  that he has again
resumed the methodical manner of living
that has characterized his every-day -life
foi many years past. ''He arose at the
usual hour this morning, . disposed of his
early meal, which was not of au uncom
monly large quantity, and then in com
pany with Clark Tonner of . Canton, in
dulged in a wnlk about the residence por
tion of the city. The air was cool and'
bracing, and the pair walked at a brisk
gait for nearly an , hour. *
After calling at his mother's residence
on Tuscarawas street the President-elect 1
returned to his home on Market Hill. He
announced that he was feeling ' excellent
and at once plunged into his favorite oc
cupation of perusing a pile of newspapers
that daily come to him in the mail. Al
though Major McKinley has never had
any newspaper experience \hi : has a fac
ulty of disposing of and getting the meat
out of a huge pile of newspapers that
would reflect credit upon some of the
most trained exchange editors of the pro
fession. â¢*â â¢'â 
Later in the afternoon quite a number
of visitors culled to congratulate Presi
dent-elect McKinley. Among them was
Dr. Satterthwaite of Fargo, N. D., with
whom Major McKinley held an unusually
lone conversation.
The newspaper men who were on duty
at the Chicago National headquarters, and
who were banqueted in New York by
Chairman Hanna, will pass through Can
ton at lOrliU o'clock to-morrow morning.
Major McKinley will drive down to the
Pittsburg. Fort Wayne and Chicago de
pot, where he will meet and greet the
correspondents en-route.
Many congratulary messages were re
ceived to-day by Major McKinley.
SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE.
Friendt of Samuel IK AUerton Anxious
to Secure Him a Portfolio.
CHICAGO, 111.. Nov. 9.â The friends of
Samuel W. A.lerton, the well-known
stock dealer, havo inaugurated a move
ment looking to the appointment of that
gentleman as Secretary of Agriculture.
Last week Secretary Baker of the Chicago
Livestock Exchange mailed letters to nil
livestock centers asking for the opinion of
their members, and favorable answers
havrf been received from Omaha, St. Louis,
Kansas City, St. Joseph and Denver.
When asked if he had been approached
on the subject Mr. Allerton said to-day:
"The choosing of &uch a position is left to
the President and is a sort of family affair.
Still, if my friends and Mr. McKinley saw

A TARIFF ON WOOL.
Fayne Say That American lnUrenU
Ar* to He Frot'Ctrd.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Nov. 9.â Henry
C. Payne left for New York to-day to at
tend to private business and consult with
Chairman Hanna of the Republican Nt
tional Committee on plans for the future
campaign work of the party and perhaps
incidentally help the big chieftain with
his advice relative to Cabinet nnd other
appointments for the man from Canton.
Mr. Payne said that the old McKinley
tariff act will not be revived by Congress,
but lhat there will certainly be tariff legis
lation as soon as possible to protect Amer
ican industries and raise enough revenue
for the expenses of the Government. A
tariff on wool will be one of its chief fea
tures.
AMBITION OF CUMMINS.
Would lie Willing to Jtrcome the Ifext
attorney- Uenttrnl.
DES MOINES, lowa, Nov. 9.â The name
of A. B. Cummins of this city has been
mentioned in Chicago newspapers in con
nection with a place in McKinley's Cabi
net.. The position of Secretary of War
has been most spoken of, but it develops
that thi3 is not the place to which Mr.
Cummins aspires. From close friends of
Mr. Cummins, who is lowa's member of
the National Committee, it Is learned that
during the campaign he has been. much
talked of by campaign leaders in connec
tion with the Attorney-Generalship. It
has been commonly conceded that lowa
was likely to secure a representation in
the next Cabinet, and Senator Allison has
been generally looked on as a probable
Secretary of the Treasury. In case he
does not desire that place, it is understood
Mr. Cummins will be pushed for the posi
tion of Attorney-General. It is also stated
in this connection that Senator Allison
will not be a candidate for a Cabinet posi
tion. Mr. Cummins is a lawyer of fine
attainments, an orator and for years a
leader in the party in lowa.

SETTLES DOWN
IN SOFT MUD
Disaster Seems to Overhang
the Big Battle- Ship
Texas.
Almost Sunk While Being Docked
at the Brooklyn Navy-
Yard*
SAVED BY SHALLOW WATER
Carelessness and an Accident Prob
ably Cause the Engine-Rotm to
Bs Filled.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 9.â The battle
ship Texa? added another to the list of her
misfortunes this morning at the Cob dock
in the Brooklyn Navy-yard. The yoke of
the valve of her main starboard injector
gave way. The water poured intu the
starboard engine-room and the battie-ship
went to the bottom.
There was less than thirty feet of water
in the dock and tho Texas draws about
twenty-four feet, so she did not go down
far. She rested easily iv the soft East
River mud, with her water line four feet
under the surface.
The Texas has been at the navy-yard for
a week undergoing slight repairs. The
repairs include some minor changes in the
starboard injector, and to make these the
pipes connecting it with the condenser
were disconnected aud the engines covered
with temporary plates.
On Sunday afternoon Captain Glass
made an inspection of the entire ship.
He saw the injector with its valve and
coudenser pipes, and they seemed to
be all right. The injector is the ap
paratus through which *.ea water is
taken into the condensers. It consists of
a 13-inch pipe running from the bottom of
the ship to the starboard engine-room
where it ends in a bowl lrom
which the pipes lead to the con
densers. It is furnished with
a steel vnlve closing against a flange to>
keep thÂ« water out when it is not needed.
This valve is raised and lowered by a steel
screw operated by a wheel and working in
a yoke at the top of the bowl. The yoke
is of steel and weighs about 500 pounds.
Ths strain of water against the valve
proved too much for the yoke at 6:15 this
morning, and it broke short off, allowing
the valve to rise and thus permitting the
water to rush into tne bowl.
The temporary caps over the pipes were
blown off and the bonnet of the bowl was
dislodged. A Blrenm of water 13 inches in
diameter rushed into the starboard en
gine-room.
Engineer Hipgins wa3 in the engine
room when the yoke gave way, and he
ran up on the deck when he saw what
a body of water was flowing in and
how serious the accident was. He
gave the alarm, and the steam siren
whistle was blown, the signal to close
water-tight bulkheads. Then the gongs
sounded the call to general quarters and
the men came up on the run.
Captain Glass took personal command.
The order to close the bulkheads was
obeyed by tbÂ« men as though they Had
been at a drill and it was executed in two
ruinutes and twenty seconds. The
water continued to pour in un
til the starboard engine compart
ment was completely Hooded. The
longitudinal bulkhead dividing the en
gine-rooms has several Email openings in
it and the water leaked through and soon
flooded the port engine-room, but the
closing -of the transverse bulkheads pre
vented it from reaching any other part of
the ship.
When the Texas came to a stop on
the bottom of the river her bow
had sunk five feet and the stern
a little more. Captain Glass re
ported to Commodore Sicard, the com
mandarU of the navy-yar^l, and a report
of the accident was at once forwarded to
Secretary Herbert at Washington. Then
the work o! raising the ship was begun.
Wrecking tugs steamed alongside and a
diver was sent down in the starboard en
gine-room 10 try to plug the injector and
make it possible for the water
to be pumped out. Late in
the afternoon the divers succeeded
in fitting a big wooden plug into the end
of the injector, and then the pumps began
to make an impression on the water in
the engine-room.
At 8:30 o'clock the ship righted, and
soon after that she was floated.
She was launched from the Norfolk
Navy Yard on June 28, 1892, and
went into commission in the spring
of 1895. Her life has been one
of mishaps, several of which have
been of a more serious nature than her
present accident. She has had more acci
dents than all the rest ot the North At
lantic squadron put together.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 9.âSecre
tary Herbert ordered the following court
of inquiry on the accident to the battle
ship Texas:
Commodore J. N. Miller, now command
ant of the Boston Navy-yard; Chief En
gineer W. W. Dungan, the senior officer of
his corps, now inspector of machinery at
Cramps, and Naval Constructor J. F.
Hanscom, with lieutenant B. T. Walling
as judge advocate. The court will meet
at the navy-yard, New York, at 1 p. m.,
Wednesday.
The only additional information the
Navy Department has received is con
tained in the following telegram from
Commodore Sicard :
A section of the starboard main Injection
pipe was removed for repairs and the pipe to
seaward was blanketed off justj ust inside of the
main injection valve, just above the floor
plates. This morning about 6 o'clock
the yoke through which tne stem to the
inject ion- valve passed broke under the
pressure of the water outside and the sea
water fi led the starboard eiogine compartment
and thence leaked through; the closed water
tight doors and graaually flooded the port
encine compartment. The ship is not flooded
in other parts. The *hip.settled down upon
the soft bottom, beading bouth, and now lies
easily at high water Jn twenty-fire feet of
water on the poM side and twenty-nSne on
the starboard side, secured to Cob dock, just
south of the Vermont's stern, and lilted about
six degrees to slarbonr-1.
Two tugs of Hie Chapman Wrecking Com
pany are alongside p>Vmping. and a diver is
down in the starboard <ongine-room endeavor
ing to stop the lean. The Narkeeta is in at
tendance; tne Nina's boilers are repairing,
canuot be used. Drj'aoek No. 2 is being pre
pared to receive th.j Texas as soon as the IÂ°Â£K
Js stopped. Further details will be wired a 8a 8
soon as obtainable. Sicard.
It appears from this that the usual pre
cautions presc-ibed by the regulations
were observed by those in charge of the
work, which involved "banking off" |the
connections, and an the workmen had
left the valve all right Saturday, the acci
dent early this morning before work was
resumed indicates that the yoke gave way
to tne one-ton pressure that had been
upon it for about thirty-six hours. The
reference to the naval tugs Narkeeta and
Nina is taken as explaining why outside
tugs were called upon in the emergency.
MRS. CASTLE IS FREE.
The Home Secretary Signs an Order for
the Re/ease of the Unfortunate
Woman.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 10.â A special
cabie dispatch to the Sun from London
says:
The Home Secretary signed last night
an order for the release of Mrs. Castle from
Wormwood Scrubbs Jail. She will be dis
charged to-day unless she is unable to
leave the infirmary, where she is still
prostrate. Her husband will go with her
to America as soon as she is able to travel.
The pressure that has been brought to
bear uiion the Government to secure Mrs.
Castle's release has been of astonishing
weight and influence. Both the Home
and Foreign offices have received many
messages daily from this country and the
United States beseeching immediate ac
tion.
Popular sympathy in England isentirely
in her favor, and there will be no criti
c sms when her release is announced this
afternoon.
WENT WITH "POWELL'S PLAYERS."
But the Enraged Father Camped on the
Trail of the Stage-Struck Girl
and Took Her Home.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 9.â A sensa
tional elopement wai nipped here to-night
by the police. Saida Chambers, the 16
-year-old daughter of James E. Chambers,
a capitalist and banker of Painesville,
Ohio, left her home Sunday with Robert
Powell, manager of a road company
known as "Powell's Players." They came
to this city with the father in hot pursuit.
"Powell's Players" played in Paines
ville last week, and a constant attendant
at the performances was Miss Chambers.
She became stage struck and made her
desire to go on the staye known to Powell.
The latter planned for her to secretly
leave with him when he departed from
Painesville. This she did. He promised
marriage. The girl had not left her home
before she was missed.
Her father secured the assistance of
Deputy Sheriff Macy, and the two came to
Cleveland and applied to the local police
for aid. The couple were located and both
were arrested. Tne girl clung to her lover
and wept at the parting.
Powell was held on the charge of abduc
tion. The girl relurued home with her
father.

Settled.
Pleased With the Triumph of

ica's Election.
VIEWS THE TURKISH QUESTION
Believes That Ttere Should Be a
Concert of Powers and Praises
the French Stani.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 9.â There was a
sumptuous display to-night at the ban
quet marking the installation into office of
George Faudel Phillips, the new Lord
Mayor of London. The banqueting hall
of the Guildhall was crowded, many of
those present being of world-wide celeb
rity, including Prime Minister Salisbury;
the Right Hon. George J. Goschen, First
Lord of the Admiralty; Lord Georea
Hamilton, Secretary of Stat; for India;
Lord balsbury. Lord High Chancellor; the
Right Hon. Charles T. Richie, president
of the Board of Trade; General Lord
Wolseley, commander-in-chief of the
British iorces; General Sir Herbert Kitch
ener, sirdar of the Egyptian army; the
Right Hon. William Court Gully, Speaker
of the House cf Commons, and the Hon.
Thomas F. Bayard, the American Embas
sador.
Interest centered in the speech made by
Lord Salisbury, it being the custon in
recent years for the Prime Minister at the
Lord Ma3 r or's banquet to make a state
ment regarding the foreign and domestic
policies of the Government.
Embassador Bayard replied to the toast,
''The Foreign Representatives."
Mr. Bayard, in treating of the com
munity of interests of the nations of the
world, all being affected by the doings of
others, referred to the Presidential elec
tion in the United States, saying: "I am
very sure that it was in no narrow party
sense, no merely National sense, that the
heart of the people which it is my highest
honor to represent was echoed in a ver
dict that could not be misunderstood,
standing as it does for National honor and
the continuity of National obligations,
making the nations safer in the trust o?
each part, and speaking a3 emphatically
as the human mind and human heart
ever spoke in favor of that honesty which
is an essential condition of civilization
everywhere." [Loud cheers.]
When Lord Salisbury arose to reply to
the toast "Our Ministers" he received an
ovation. After thanking the Lord Mayor
and the othe^ present for the warmth of
the welcome extended to him he said:
"I thank the Embassador of the United
States for his presence here, and for join
ing a great historic meeting. By the few
words he has uttered he has raised his
own plane of observation so high above
the mere level of party that, though con
trary to practice to remark upon the inter
nal politics of other states, I may bo per
mitted, without impertinence, to congratu
late him upon the splendid pronounce
ment the great people he represents have
made in behalf of the principles which lie
at the base of all human society. [Cheers.]
"You are aware ttiat in the discussion
had in the United States on behalf of their
friends in Venezuela our question has- not
been whether there should bo arbitration,
but whether arbitration should havo un
restricted application, and we have always
claimed that those who, apart from
historic right, ha-d the right which
attached to established settlements should
be excluded from arbitration. Our diffi
culty for months has been to define to
settled districts, and the solution has, I
think, come from the Government of the
United States, that we should treat our
colonial empire as we treat individuals;
that the same lapse of time which protects
the latter in civic life from having their
title questioned should similarly protect
an English colony, but beyond that, whei
a lapse could not be claimed, there should
be an examination of title, and all the
equity demanded in regard thereto should
be granted. Ido not believe lam using
undue sanguine words when I declare my
belief that this has brought the contro
versy to an end. [Loud cheers.]
"It is a matter oi no small satisfaction
to the Government that at a time when
anxious social questions, which are far
more important than political questions,
are troubling the United States, and
therefore troubling the world, we should
have any semblance of political difference
that might hinder common action in de
fense of the common heritages of society.
"We have had an anxious year at the
Foreign Office, but we have floated into a
period of comparative calm, and I do not
intend to trouble you with matters that
have passed away."
Lord Salisbury then proceeded to the
Turkish question. He repeated the argu
ments against Great Britain taking iso
lated action against the Porte and empha
sized the fact that the military occupation
of Turkey would be necessary if such ac
tion were taken. Great Britain, he de
clares, could not occupy the country un
less she established conscription. He
pictured the risk of an European war and
saia that the six great powers must act in
concert. Any one of these powers was
able to veto the other. He denied that
the powers were acting on selfish prin
ciples. Tney had rirni ground for differ
ence of opinion. The motives influencing
the British Government must influence all
conscientious ruler 3.
Her Majesty's Government, he added,
had been urged by the Right Key. John
Morley and others to abandon its policy
of the past and renounce certain lands, in
which case the foreign powers would ac
cept Great Britain's policy. He did not
believe in anything of the sort At all
events he did not see any cause to abandon
the policy hitherto pursued or to relin
quish an acre of ground now occupied by
ihe British. [Cheers.] "*
Continuing, Lord Salisbury declarrf2
that the concert ot Europe seemed to be
in a more favorable condition to extirpate
the terrible disease in the East than ever
before. He eulogized the speech made on
Tuesday last by M. Hanotaux, the
French Foreign Minister, in the Chamber
of Deputies. He did not. he said, expect
that France would try to baffle tho action
of the European concert, while, he added,
the triple alliance had always been in
sympathy with the British doctrine re
garding the Eastern question.
gLord Salisbury repudiated the idea that
there was a necessity of permanent an
tagonism between Great Britain and Rus
sia. [Cheers.] Such an idea was a super
stition of antiquated diplomacy. He had,
he said, good ground for believing that
Russia had the same views. He did not
desire to imply that there was any power
with which Great Britain would specially
act. He only protested against the idea
that any power was specially Great
Britain's opponent.
He would not say there would be diffi
culty in concurring in any scheme to ex
ercise force if the other powers agreed,
but he did not know whether the use of
force was meditated against Turkey. He
referred to the latest promises of reform
made by the Sultan, and said that the
future alone could determine how far even
such humble promises as these would be
realized. He hoped the powers would be
able to convince Turkey that she was
drifting in the current toward an abyss,
and tbat tney would succeed in diverting
her before she arrived at the edge.
PERFECTLY S A TISFACTORY.
Terms of Agreement for the Venezuelan
Settlement.
LONDON, Em, Nov. 9.â The Daily
News, commenting to-m,orrow upon Lord
Salisbury's speech at the Guildhall, will
say in reference to his explanation of the
Venezuelan matter that tne terms of tbe
settlement as stated by the Prime Minister
are perfectly satisfactory, involving no
surrender of essential principles. The so
lution arrived at will enable each
side to claim a victory. Lord Salisbury
can justly sayhe succeeded in protecting
the rights of the British settlers, and Mr.
Olney can claim witb literal truth that he
succeeded in bringing Great Britain to
consent to arbitration.
The Post will say on the settlement of
the Venezuelan dispute that it is wholly
satisfactory to the United States and
Great Britain.
The Daily Graphic holds that the solu
tion of the vexatious question reflects the
highest credit upon all concerned. It
fully justifies the intervention of the
United States.
The Standard will briefly welcome the
"auspicious announcement."
The Chronicle will say that it finds
Lord Salisbury's statement rather puz
zling. It doubts whether settled colonists
exist in any great numbers, but supposes
it is all right

Cuba.
LONDON, Eho., Nov. 9.â A dispatch to
the Central News from Madrid says that
cable advices from Havana show that ex
tensive operations against the rebels are
beginning. Captain-General Weyler will
start lor Artemissa to-morrow to attack
Maceo in the Cuzzo Hills.
HAVANA, Cuba, Nov. 9.â No news has
been received from Puerto Principe, aud
details are lacking of the siege of Guay
niayo, which Â«a; lately reported to have
been captured by tne rebels. Railroad
connection with that place has been broken
since October 2.
A large rebel force attacked the town of
Aguada, province of Matanzas. Tlie gar
rison made a brilliant defense and re
pulsed the insurgents, killing five of them,
including their leader, Menendez. The
Spaniards lost a major a<ld one soldier
killed and three wounded. There are
now, according to an official report, 13,637
soldiers ill in the various military hos
pitals on the island.
Captain-General Weyler arrived at
Muriel this morning. The troops accom
panying him were incorporated with 6000
men, who had been sent from Guanaqua,
and the entire command started in the
direction of the hills in search of Msfceo.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 9â The
Duke of Tttuan, Minister of Foreign Af
fairs at Madrid, cabled Eenor Dupuy de
Lome this afternoon that General Weyler
left Havana to-day to take immediate
personal command in the fieid of t:.e
comprehensive operations against the
insurgents, which has been in
preparation for some months and
for which large re-enforcements have been
made available. The Minister says the
campaign will be pursued most energet
ically, and that a change in the situation
in Cuba may be quickly expected. There
is apparently no ground for a report cir
culated to-day that the Spanish Minister,
Dupuy de Lome, would be recalled. It is
pouited out by the State Department
officials "that the Minister has been ex
ceedingly active as Spain's representative,
and that at this juncture his recall, even
for promotion to a higher post, tcight be
disastrous to Spain's intere-ts.

SOLLY SMITH IS
THE CHAMPION
Wrestles the Laurels From
Willie in Eight
Rounds.
The English Feather- Weight No
Match for the Caliiornia
Hurricane.
GO SOWN BEFORE RUSHES.
Finally the Referee Stops the Mi 1
and G.ves the Decision to
tbe American.
LONDON. Eng., Nov. 9.â The fight be
tween Solly Smith of Los Angeles, Cal.,
and Willie Smith, tho feather-weight
champion of England, for a purse of Â£500,
took place to-night at the National Sport
ing Club. The American was awarded
the fight in the eighth round.
A big crowd saw the fight The English
man was the favorite at odds of 7 to 4 on,
early in the day; but a fair amount of
money was lad on the American to-night,
tbe odds then falling to 6 to 4 oa the
Englishman. Both men fought at 116
pounds. Solly Smith's seconds were
Trainer Dealing and Dally Monroe, while
Burge and Orage acted in a similar ca
pacity for the Englishman.
Solly opened the fight with a wicked
swing. His rushes puzzled the English
man, but the first round was harmless.
In the second round Solly forced the
fighting, but a heavy blow aimed at his
opponent missed its mark, and he fell
upon his knees. Shortly afterward he
again missed a smashing blow.
In the tnird round Solly landed a sting
ing left on Willies chin, knocking him
off his feet The Englishman was down
for six seconds. If Solly had steadied
himself be might have ended tbe fight in
this round, as when the Englishman got
on his feet he was all abroad and Solly
punched him right and left
When time was called for the fourth
round the American was again the ag
gressor, landing repeatedly on Willies
throat and head, but not stopping him.
In the fifth round Solly lauded one
heavy blow.
The sixth round was remarkable for
nothing save the strong fighting of the
American who, however, did no very
great damage to his opponent.
Solly's work in the seventh round was
of the hurricane order. He fought (be
Englishman up and down, and the latter
was saved only by the call of timo.
In the eighth round Solly punched
Willie all over the ring uniil the reieree
stopped tbe fight and awarded it to the
American.
The National Sporting Club also put up
a purse for a fignt between Billy Hill,
otherwise Muldoor.'s "Pickaninny. " and
Arthur Callan. The>*e was a very fast
opening, Hiil having the better of It.
Later the fighting became more even and
for a time the result was doubtful. There
was much clinching, especially by Callan,
who adopted this metbod of escaping
punishment. Hiil won tbe fight in tbe
fourteenth round.
"SCALDY BILY" DEFEATED.
Badly Battered During the Battle Uith
Dick O'lirien.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 9.â Popular
prices and an attractive programme
served to crowd the Union Athletic Club
to the doors to-night. The principal
event was a twenty-round encounter be
tween "Scaldy Bill" Quinn, who hails
from tie Pennsylvania coal regions, and
DickO'Brieu of Boston. It was the sec
ond "go" between the colored boy and
the Bostonian, as they bad previously
fought a draw. There were fully 2500 peo
ple present when the opening oout, ten
rounds at 118 pounds, between Mike SearÂ£
o' Boston and Charley Kelly of New York,
was announced. Sam Austin was referee.
In the last round Sears puncbed his man
right and left on the jaw and quickly had
him on Queer street, but the New Yorker
was strong and stayed tht distance. The
reieree awarded tbe decision to Sears.
The next pair was two local celebrities,
Kid McPartland and Harry Peterson, who
were scheduled to go ten rounds at 140
pounds. McPartland was declared the
winner.
"Scaldy" Bill and O'Brien got into the
ring at 10:40 o'clock. O'Brien was looked
after by Jack Burns. Danny McÃride,
Billy Anderson and Derb Upton. Bill's
seconds were Ciiarlcy White, Frank Pur
nell and Sammy Meyers. O'Brien weiehed
156 pounds and Q.iinn scaled 148. They
shook bands at 10:45.
After O'Brien had tapped his man
ligbly twice bill can.c in witb a couple of
wild swings from which the Boston boy
got away. Scaldy rushed in and swung
right and lett on tbe jaw sending O'Brien
to hi* knees. Bill seemed willing to take
all O'Brien could send in.
In the second round Scaley came into a
right on the neck, but it did not feeze
him. O'Brien sent both bands to tbe face
and bad Scaldy rattled, but failed to fol
low up. Quiun sent a hot left to the wind
before the bell rang.
Scaldy was very wild in the third and
O'Brien landed several times on the jaw,
but his blows lacked force and the colored
boy only smiled. He seemed to want
O'Brien to wear himself out.
O'Brien opened ihe fourth with a sound
ing whack on Bill's spine. But the lat
ter came back twice on the wind hard.
They mixed things up toward tbe end of
the round and O'Brien bad almost got his
man out with right and left banders
when tbe bell rang.
Tbe tilth was practically a repetition,
but O'Brien could not hit hard enough to
put Scaldy out.
Both were pretty well done up at tbe
end of the sixth, but O'Brien had the
round well in band. He blocked most of
Bill's leads and the latter's swings when
they landed with their usual force.
l!j tbe seventh the Boston man jabbed
until he had Bill's face bleeding, and the
colored boy was very weaH, but game.
Soaldy was staggering around the ring
and O'Brien had his nose almost mashed
into his face, but the bell again saved
Bill.
It was only a question of time in the
nintb, and if O'Brien could have landed
a really hard blow, Scaidy would have
gone out, but Dick was 100 tired and the
gong came to Bill's relief.
Bill came up full of right in the tenth,
but O'Brien was too clever for him and
stopped tbe rush. Scaldy's nose and
mouth were bleeding and his left eye was
nearly closed, but, despite tbe punishment
he was receiving, he was game and on his
feet when the round closed.
Scaldy put his left hard on the body
three times and swung a right on the
jaw, but a left on the neck from the Boi
ton man sent Scaldy to hi- Knees and took
the steam out of him. Quinn's lip was a
fearful sight Again and again O'Brien
forced the negro to his knees, but could

not put him out and the Boston man wa s
getting weak from his own exertions.
There were loud cries of foul in the
twelfth because O'Brien pasted his man
with one hand free, but no foul was al
lowed. O'Brien had Bill at his mercy,
but conld not get in a decisive blow. At
last Scaldy's seconds threw up the sponge
alter two minutes and fifty-three seconds
of the thirteenth round and O'Brien was
declared the winner.

SLAIN BY A FIERCE BEAR
Rev. Charles D. Mentor Attacked
and Torn to Pieces in
Montana.
B ood-Stained Evidences of a Terrib'e
S'rugg c With the Brute in
the Snow.
TROY, Mont., Nov. 9.â Rev. Charles D.
Mentor was attacked by a bear near this
point and torn to pieces in a desperate
fight. He had been out witb a hunting
party and Saturday sought to adventure
alone in the hills. That night be did not
return and when morning came a relief
party was organized and search was insti
tuted for him. Several miles from the
camp the searchers found blood on tbe
snow and later came to a spot where a
terrible struggle had taken place.
The trail in the snow to the point where
the animal had dragged th â  body was fol
lowed and what was left of it was found,
mangled, torn, shredded and frozen, cov
ered witb the life blood of the man who
atteraji'.eil to defend himself against the
brute. Judging by tr.tcks in the snow the
fight must have been a fearful one. Tbe
body had been partly devoured by the
animal when tbe relief party arrived.

CLEVELAND MAY
REWARD BYNUM
Vacant Seat in the Court of
Claims Wanted by the
Indianan.
But Certain Senators Will Refuse
to Confirm Such a Nom
ination.
ONLY ONE COURSE REMAINS.
If the Office Is Not Filled the Appoint
ment Will Be Made by
McX n!ey.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 9.â lt is
possible that President Cleveland will not
throw upon Major McKinley's shoulders
the entire burden of rewarding the Na
tional Democrats who aided so materially
in carrying the day for McKiniey and
honest money.
Ex-Representative Bynum of Indiana,
to whose activity the Indianapolis con
vention owed its exisence and who as
eliairman of the National Democratic cam
paign contributed no little to success, is a
candidate for the vacancy on the bench of
Court of Claims created by the recent
death of Judge Richardson. The office
pays $5000 per annum and is a life ap
pointment. A life appointment is what
Mr. Bynnm needs, for there is no reason
to believe that the regular Democracy of
Indiana will ever permit his election to
any office in the gift of Indiana Demo
crats. There is some doubt as to Mr.
Cleveland's willingness to appoint Mr.
Bynum to the office. This is not the first
office for which the Indiana ex-Congress
man has been a candidate. Indeed, there
has been scarcely a vacancy since he was
defeated for re-election to Congress for
which he had not been a candidate.
Hitherto, however, the bitter' opposition
of Postmaster-General Wilson to any
recognition of Mr. Bynum's aspirations
has sufficed to defeat him. Mr. Wilson
has always held Mr. Bryan personally re
sponsible for the pitiable manner in
which the House surrendered to the Sen-
ate in the matter of the Wilson-Gorman
tariff bill. Mr. Bynura was a member of
the Ways and Means Committee which
framed the Wilson bill and passed it
through the House, hut he was also the
first man in the House to advocate agree
ing to the Senate amendments to the bill,
that is to say to abandon the Wilson bill
and to accept in its stead the substitute
which Mr. Gorman had passed through
the Senate.
Hence Mr. Wilson has always opposed
any reques: Mr. Bryan made. Mr. Cleve
land is in a difficult position. He finds it
difficult, of course, to disregard the
wishes of so warm a personal friend as
Mr. Wilson, and at the same time he
realizes that he is in justice and propriety
bound tc dt^somethingJor Mr. Bynuin now
that the opportunity offers itself. Mr.
Bynum was tlie official head of the move
ment which represented the attitude of
President Cleveland and hi 3 Cabinet in
tbe campaign. He wants an office which
it is in Mr. Cleveland's power to give
him. If Mr. Bynum was good enough for
Mr. Cleveland to permit bis selection as
chairman in a convention which was ab
solutely composed of only Cleveland men,
then he ougnt to be good enough for the
office he wants.
Mr. Bynum's confirmation by the San
ate is a totally different proposition.
Senator Voorhees of Indiana may regard
his defeat for election to the Senate as the
result of Mr. Byuum's activity in getting
the Indiana gold Democracy solidly ar
rayed against Mr. Voornees' re-election,
and he may therefore be expected to fight
ihe confirmation bitterly. AH the other
Democratic Senators who voted for Bryan
in the last campaign may cheerfully join
Mr. Voorhees in his fight aeainst Bynum.
Bui at the same time all the Democratic
Senators have already announced that
they will defeat any gold Democrat whom
Mr. Cleveland will nominate for office this
winter, hence Mr. Bynum's nomination is
more hopeless than is that of any per
sonal friend of Mr. Cleveland. Moreover,
if Mr. Cleveland nominates Mr. Bynum,
and tbe Senate rejects him, as it probably
will, then, by declining to send in a sec
ond nomination, Mr. Cleveland can give
Mr. Bynum a quasi letter of recommen
dation to Mr. McKinley when he enters
the White House and finds the office va
cant and Mr. Bynum still willing. The
National Democratic party must be recog
nized, and Mr. Cleveland can hardly ex
ppct Mr. McKinley to take care of the
official head of that movement if he him
self publicly turns him down.

SORRY HE BET ON BRYAN
Long Ride to Be Made on a
Donkey by a Brooklyn
Society Swell.
Man and Anim ,: Must Wear Glasses
and Parade the Streets of
New York.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 9.â Of all the
election bets of the season perhaps the
most extraordinary has just come to light,
in spite of the precautions taken by the
parties thereto to preserve the secret. In
or<ier to preserve his honor and carry out
the conditions of the bet he so rashiy con
tracted with Benjamin Tiliard, a publisher
of New York, a modest and dignified
young society roan of Brooklyn must ride
a donkey from New York to San Francisco.
It was only by accident that the news
has finally got into print. Robert P.
Woodward is the unfortunate man, and
deeply mortified he is, realizing as be now
does the rare amusement ne- is to afford
his friends and the public in general.
When asked if the report was true Mr.
Woodward's surprise was too genuine to
admit of. its denial.
"Yes," said he, "I bet on the silver can
didate and lost, and as Mr. Tiliard would
surely have made good iiis wager I shall
do no less than carry out my part to the
letter."
"When do you start on your journey?"
"Immediately after Thanksgiving." Mr.
Woodward replied. "It is hard to have to
do such an absurd and disagreeable thing,
but I have put chased my donkey and
made my will and I shall go. I thing if I
am lucky as to reach the coast I shall go
right on around the world â but not on a
donkey. I don't care to show my face in
Brooklyn for some years 10 come,
"Ii is not the overland trip that is so
shocking to them and to me," be contin
ued, "butâ but the conditions. You see, I
must parade on my donkey certain popu
lar thoroughfares in New York City be
fore starting. No, I decline to name the
streets. I aon't want to see a familiar
face on that occasion. Both my steed and
myself must wear spectacles, and I a frock
coat atid silk hat and on my transcon-
I tinental trip I must visit both the victori
ous and the aefeated candidate. I must
start within one moatu after election
i day."
And Mr. Woodward's countenance de
picted utter disgust as the reporter de
parted. It is suggested that on his arrival
in San Francisco be be presented with a
fool's cap.
Mr. Tiliard was found in his office in
! New York, and on learning that his co
i bettor had explained the terms of the bet
said it was all true. He would give no
lurtber information.
SANTA FE RECEIVERSHIP.

OSCALOOSA, Kans.. Nov. 9.â The pro
ceed.ngs against the Santa Fa Railway
Company wherein it was sought to throw
its property located in Kansas into the
hands of a receiver took an unexpected
and interesting turn to-day. The case
was taken, out of the Jefferson County
court ana transferred to the United States
court, to be beard by Judge Foster, on
the ground that, as all the provisions or
dered by the (Jnited States court In the
former receivership matter had not yet
been complied with and the Master in
Chancery discharged, the road was yet in
the bands of the United States court, and
hence no suit against k could be brought
in any District Court
The case was also taken out of the hands
of County Attorney Phynney of Jefferson
County, who brought the suit, by Gover
nor Morrill, who issued an order instruct
ing the attorney to take charee of the
case. The Governor's action makes the
controversy now between the State and
the road. If, as rumored, there is any
scheme back of the case, tbe Governor's
action nips it in tbe bud.
OLANDERED A DEAD CAPTAIN
Charges of Drttnkrnnews Made by a Sea
man Not Believed.
CHICAGO, Ihh., Nov. 9.â Much indig
â¢nation was expressed by marine men
to-day over the sensational charges of
drunkenness made by Sailor Frank
Dulacb, the sole survivor of the wrecked
schooner Waukesha, against Captain
Duncan Corbett. Franklin H. Head, the
owner of the ill-fated boat, says that he
had known Captain Corbett for twenty
years; during most of tbe time he had
sailed vessels owned by him. He had
never known Corbett to take a drink of
liquor, and he did not believe a word that
Dulach had said concerning the dead com
mander.
Other vessel men expressed similar sen
timents, and tbe feeling became so intense
that an effort was made to start proceed
ings against Dulach for mutiny, but as all
the witnesses are dead the matter was
dropped.
Merchants Assign.
ARDMORE, Ind. T., Nov. 9.âMunsh
heimer & Dalz, general merchandise,

sum.
GOTHAM'S HORSE
SHOW IS OPENED
High- Steppers, Hunters and
Hackneys Exhibited in
the Ring.
Less Entries but a Higher
Class of Animals Are
Displayed.
NOTICEABLE NEW FEATURES.
Some of the Four Hundred, However,
Fail to Display Their Beauties
This Year.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 9.â Promptly
at 9:30 o'clock the gayly caparisoned bu
gler blew a farfare on his trumpet and the
twelfth annual horse show of the National
Horse Show Associatien opened. From
10:30 to 11:30 was devoted to exercising in
the ring, and the high-steppers, hunters,
hackneys and othercandidates for ribbons
were put through a warming-up process.
The present show presents one or two
new features, and the entries number
about 100 less than last year. Secretary
James T. Hyde, however, claims that t! c
class of entries is of a much higher grade
than last year. Consequently the diminu
tion in numbers is made up for by increase
in quality. A new aud very welcome fea
ture is the holding of a preliminary trial
of the hunters and jumpers classes as the
first event each day. The sulky weeds,
which In former years delayed the regular
events of the show far beyond tlie ap
pointed time, will thus be disposed of
early, and the jumping classes at night
will not be prolonged to a tiresome extent.
In the list of entries there are several
notab^s absentees. Those of William C.
Whitney, W. Seward Webb and the mem
bers of the Vanderbilt family will be
missed. Some of the best known ex
hibitors from out of town are: W. M.
Barton, Hinsdale, III.; Adam Beck, Lon
don, Ont. ;J. B. Cameron, Marietta, Pa.;
A. J. Cassatt, Berwyn, Pa.; Horace N.
Crossley, Ontario, Canada; W. J. Samp
son, Youngstown. Ohio, and C. J. and H.
Hamlin, Buffalo, N. Y. The first class to
be signaled into the ring at noon was
jumpers lor preliminary trial.
At 2 o'clock the trumpet flared and tbe
harness horses in class 47 came up for
ribbons, and after an hour's trying the
judges awarded the blue rosette to C. F.
Bates' brown gelding Coxey. while second
prize went to George B. Hulme's Great
Scott, and the r<;d rosette to Bates' second
string Amazon. The Hillyards Flash was
highly commended.
Class 38 brou ght out five French coach
ing stallions, four years old and over, kept
for service. N. W. Dunham of Wayne,
111., swept the boards with bU Ind re,
Perfection and Urhin, while Partisan,
bred by tbe same, exhibited by E. W.
Barton of Hillsdale, lIL, was a magnifi
cent typo of bis breed, but was no match
in act. on and going qualities for his siabie
mate Indre.
Colonel Kip was an absentee from the
roadster class tbis year and first prize
went to C. W. Reed of Erie, Pa., for Alice
Leyburn, a nice-looking naare by Baron
Wilkes. The red rosette went to Holmes
Dale, a handsome bay gelding ovrned by
William Pollack of Piitsiieid, Mass., while
the Village Farm's entry, King Bird, was
awarded the yellow ribbon.
John S. Bretten of Englewood, 111.
showed a nice pair in The Czar and the
Sultan, which took the crowd, in class 54,
for pairs suitable for a Stanbope, Victoria
or similar vehicle, but tbe judges sent
them down quickly for want of size and
conformation. O. H. P. Belmont's pair,
Rockingbam and Walsingbam, got the
blue rosette. Monarch and Performer,
who carried all before them last year,
had to put up with the red ribbon to-day!
The winners were a showy pair, but
iacked the conformation of Mr. Hobart's
cracks. C. F. Bates' Aspiration and Am
bition got third and a handsome pair
owned by E. D. Morgan were highly com
mended.

PIRATES CAUGHT
Two Poaching Schooners
Taken by Mexican
Officers.
Overhauled by a Steamer an
Towed Into Ensenada
Harbor.
CREW OF ONE GET AWAY.
Reach the Shore in a Boat and Are
Hiding From Mounted
Rurales.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 9.â After carry
ing on a piratical business for over three
years in stealing guano off the Lower
California islands In defiance of the Mexi
can Government the crews of two San
Diego scnooners now repent their illicit
t-raffic. The schooners are the Ellen,
â¢ Captain Jensen, and the Peking, Captain
Goodlin. Captain Jensen and his two
sailors, McAllister and Anderson, are in
.jail at Ensenada, and Captain Goodlin
and his two sailors are in hiding tome
. where on the peninsula, with the chances
ten to one that they do not escape.
Tne steamer Pacheco, which sailed from
here Wednesday night, was under orders
to take on Mexican custom officials and
armed guards at Ensenada and hurry
down the lower coast after guano smug
glers. The headquarters of the gang has
. been at Elida Island, 350 miles south of
here, where there are rich cuauo deposits.
The steamer found nobody there and
came up tue coast looking into the little
coves where guano schooners occasionally
put in. At Santa Ros-aiia Bay, 300 miles
â¢'â¢south of San Diego, five schooners were
sfghted.
The Pacheco found one, tho Ellen, just
putting to sea, the skipper having seen
the steamer's smoke. Under full steam
the Pacheco soon overtook the schooner
and threw lines out. It was rather excit
ing, as the guano poachers are men of
daring, and they. had declared many times
that rather than lie in a Mexican dungeon
" they would right to the death, but the
show of cocked rifles over the steamer's
rail overawed the guano men and they
s-urrendered. Captain Jensen and his two
men were transferred to the rtcamer and
placed in irons, and the custom officers
took charge of the schooner.
Then the steamer gave chase to the junk
Peking, which was hoisting sail and pre
. paring to run out to sea. The crew, see
ing they would be overtaken, abandoned
the junk and took to tne small boats,
reaching land and running and hiding in
the brush before the steamer came up.
The guards took charee of the junk.
The Pacheco put about and gave chase
. to the other three schooners that were
ecurrying out to s^a. Tney were the Alta,
Hongkong and Wahlberg. Captain Far
well of the Alta has his wife on board.
The schooners had a good start and man
aged lo pet over the three-mile limit be/ore
being overtaken. Their crews sent up a
lusty cheer and tlauntei their flags at the
officials on the steamer. The officials were
so excited and anxious, to capture the
schooners that they urged Captain Col
burn of the Pacheco to put on more steam
and take them anyhow, but the captain
knew his business and said he would not
molest anything on the high seas.
Returning to the bay the Ellen and
Peking were taken into low. The offi
cials did not stop to sparch for Captain
Goodlin and bis two sailors of the Peking,
who escaped with little food and no water.
The Mexicans said that they would starve
or be compel ed to surrender. Upon ar
rival at Ensenada to-day the three pris
oners were turned over to the authorities,
who placed them in jail.
Captain Jensen is the owner of the
Ellen, which he lately purchased. The
vesse:. as well as the Peking, will be con
fiscated by the Government. The Peking
is a rich prize, having been in a number of
ugly scrapes at Ensenada and invariably
getting away. The Mexicans have sworn
.that they would get her and place her
' crew behind bars.
Mounted rurales were dispatched from
Ensenada to-day to seek for Captain
, Goodlin and his two companions. The
authorities are confident that tue men
cannot escape, as settlements are few and
. far between and there are no vessels pass
â¢ ing that way. The only way the men can
escape will be by hailing one of the guauo
fleet, but that fljet is probably keeping
. well to sea while the Pacheco is in those
waters.
It was the junk Peking that carried
Garratt. the gold bar thief, to Ensenada
in quest of his buried booty, and it was
the Peking that had trouble at Cedros
â¢â¢Island two years ago. After the gold bar
â¢ episode the Peking sailed southward and
her skipper, Frank Colbert, and the Mexi
can cook deserted her after lootine the ves
sel, leavimr the rest of the crew to reach San
Diego as best they could. The men almost
starved belore tretting back, but they
turned right around and started after an
other cargo of guano. The Peking is
owned by C. W. Beerxnaker of National
City.
The lightest sentence that can be im
posed upon the prisoners, it is understood,
is two years in prison. Owing to the ag
gravation of the offense and the fact that
the poachers have persistently violated
the law of Mexico after repeated warnings,
it is probable that the extreme penalty
will be dealt out to them.
COLONEL ALLEN IN LUCK.

* SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 9. -Yesterday's

DEATH OF PROFESOUR MUTT
The ir*ll-KnotÃn % Chnnieal ' Expert . Ex
pire* From ''Heart Trouble.
NEW YORK; N. V., Nov. 9.â Professor
Henry A. Moit, the ' well-known chemist
arid chemical expert, died. yesterday from
heart trouble. Profesnor Mott - was â¢ born
on Stateu Island in 1852 and his grand-,
father was Valentine Mott,', the famou*
surgeon. , Pro;essor' Mot was graduated
from the School of Mines, Columbus" Col
lege, in 1873 with high honors. He. was

HOARDED GOLD RETURNING.
Banks Have Plenty of the Yellow Metal
and Can Resume Specie Pay
ments.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 9.â A special lo a
morning paper from New York says: The
banks are contemplating the resumption
of specie payments, which they suspended
in February, 1892, by refusing to supply
gold for export and for the payment of
Government dues. That action threw the
burden of supplying gold upon the treas
ury, and eventually forced the issue of
bonds by the Government, which aroused
so much complaint.
Since the election the metal has been
coming into the banks in such a flood they
see their way clear to what can be termed
resumption of specie payments. By the
payment of balances at the clearing
ho^e in clearing-house certificates for
gold, as the sub-treasury is a member
of the clearing-house, gold will flow into
the Government vaults when the sub
treasury is a creditor of the clearing
house. By this action of the banks the
metal will also be put into circulation,
and no reason whatever will exist for
hoarding it. They will also resume the
task of supplying gold for export, and
thus relieve the treasury from the strain.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Nov. 9.â For
several days heavy deposits of gold have
been made in this city, the total amount
received by banks, trust companies and
saving funds being placed at $500,000.
Of this sum $150,000 was deposited to-day.
One bank ti.is afternoon received $100,000
for v single customer, who purchased the
money in New York and this city at a
premium of J^ to 1 per cent a week prior
to the election. The gold was generally
withdrawn and hoarded to await the out
come of the election.
TAKE COSTLY DIAMONDS
Two Young Robbsrs Make a
Big Haul in the Masonic
Building.
Jeweler Hermann and His C erk Bound
and Gagged and the Safe
Looted-
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 9.â J. Hermann
<fc Co.'s jewelry-store, on the tenth floor of
the Masonic Temple, was entered by two
armed robbers late this afternoon, who
secured about $5000 worth ol diamonds, a
gold watch and coain and $100 in money
and escaped. Mr. Hermann, proprietor,
and C. A. McGuirty, a clerk, were the
only occupants of the room when the
robbers entered. They were preparing to
close up the day's business when they
were confronted with drawn revolvers.
The outlaws ordered them into one corner
of the room and then bound and gagged
both.
While one robber watched over them
with his pistol in readiness his companion
rifled the safe of its contents and slipped
a quantity of gems into his pocket. Mr.
Hermann's watch was also taken from
him. The robbers escaped as tney bad
entered and passed out into the street
without exciting suspicion.
It was several minutes before the pro
prietor and the clerk could release them
selves, and the robbers had made good
their escape. The matter was reported to
police headquarters and a dozen officers
were detailed on the case. No clew to
the identity of the robbers has been
found. They are said to be not more
than 21 years of age.
MUST PAY MISS MONROE.
The New York World Took Rather Expen-
sive Chances in Prematurely
Publishing Her Ode.
WASHINGTON. D. C. Nov. 9.â The
New York World must pay $5000 to Miss
Harriet Monroe, who wrote the ode for the
opening of the Columbian World's Expo
sition at Chicago in October, 1892, for hav
ing prematurely published the poem in
violation of her common law rights in the
manuscript.
When the World obtained possession of
an advance copy of the ode the fact came
to the knowledge of Miss Monroe and she
telegraphed the paper a warning not to
publish. The editor responded, "We will
take our chances," and the publication
was made. Suit was brought oy Miss
Monroe to recover damages.
Defense was made that the copyright
law of the United States had superseded
the common law on the subject and that
under it no punitive damage could be col
lected. The Circuit Court of the United
States for the Southern District of New
Yurk held otherwise and a verdict in favor
of Miss Monroe lor $5000 was returned.
Tne cÂ«sÂ« went to the Circuit Court of
Appeals when ihe judgment below was
affirmed. Then the World endeavored to
bring the case to the Supreme Court of the
United States on the ground that ques
tions arising under the constitution oi the
United States are involved. "But," said
Justice Gray, announcing the opinion of
the court, "it has been held in many cases
that ihat point must be raised by the
p.aintiff and not by the defendant. The
decree of the Court of Appeals was final
and the writ of error must be dismissed."

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 189 H.
USAL SUSPECTS
TENANT CELLS
John Dodge and His Wife
Brought In by a
Posse.
Surprised and Taken at Their
Hiding P ace in the
Mountains,
HELD ON A MURDER CHABGE.
Both Are Accused of Complicity in
the Assassination of Rancher
Mudgett'.
USAL, Cal., Nov. 9. â Chief Officer
Handy, in command of a posse, arrived
in Usal to-night, having in charge John
Dodge and wife. Dodge is one of the men
accused of murdering Rancher John H.
Mudgett, and Dodge's wife is chareed
with having been an accessory. The offi
cers reached here in an exhausted state,
having traversed 200 miles in the past
three days, facing a blinding rainstorm on
the last day of the chase.
The capture of Dodge and wife was
devoid of anything savoring of the pic
turesque, and was made without the least
show of resistance. When the officers
were making observations for a desirable
site to pitch camp, they left the main road
in order to reach a chosen place. Passing
along an unfrequented by-path through
the marsh, they had not gone over 100
yards when Dodge and wife were at a
campfire in the brush busily arranging
for a hurried meal. The officers halted
and dismounted at the first glimmer of
thecampfire, fastened their horses and
stealthily crept into the back ground of
the camp in order to first ascertain who
and what number surrounded the fire.
Finding thai Dodge and his wife were the
only ones in view, they closed in upon
them wiin a command to surrender.
There was no resistance. The prison
ers wt-re tied, p aced upon their horses
and brought into Usal, where they were
imprisoned pending instructions* from
Sheriff Johnson as to whether he desired
to have the hearing conducted here or at
the county seat. The party reached Usal
at 9 o'clock to-night, wet from exposure
to heavy rains and greatly fatigued after
having traveled some nfty miles through
the mountain fastnessra to-day without
food.
Tne prison in which Dodge and wife are
confined is carefully guarded by local offi
cers, who ar â  instructed to pefmit no one
to visit the rrisoner<. The exact nature
of the evidence against the wife of Dodge
cannot be clearly defined to-night, but it
is believed some of the provisions stolen
from Mudgett's dwelling were found about
their premises. The evidence against
Dodge is more conclusive. It is said that
he offered a draft payable to Mudgett to
ShafsKy Bros., grocers at Fort Bragg.
The people of Usal are excited over the
capture, but it is believed nothing alarm
ing will occur, and there are no fears of a
lynching to-night.
MRS. COVJiIMKI'S SAXITT.
A Commiaaion to Inquire Into Ber
Mental Condition.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 9.â An order
was signed in the Supreme Court hy Jus
tice Lawrence to-day on the petition of
Willard Brown of 401 West One Hundred
and Forty-eighth street, directing that a
commission issue to inquire into the
mental condition of Mrs. Isabella Cutting
Courtney.
Mrs. Courtney is the daughter of Fran
cis Cutting of San Francisco, who is at
present traveling in Europe. In 1888 she
married Harold Courtney, and one year
thereafter she showed signs of mental dis
order while she was in Europe with her
husband. She was adjudged insane by
the Italian courts in 1892 and placed
in Sbertoli Asylum in Pistoia,
where she remained until 1894,
when she was discharged and
given in the custody of her cousin, Miss
Mary Nelson Paterson, who acted as her
guardian. Miss i'aterson ano her charge
are now in the Isle ol Wight and as the
guardian is desirous of coming here with
Airs. Courtney t c commission is asked
for so that Miss Paterson may be further
appointed guardian of the demented
woman's person and estate.
It appears also from the papers that the
whereabouts o: Mr. Courtney is not
known, although it is supposed that he is
in Europe. About the time Mrs.
Courtney was discharged from the Italian
asylum an agreement was made by which
Courtney was to receive from his wife's
father $125 a month for two years and $100
a month for the succeeding two years, the
consideration being on his part that he
have no further control over his wife.
The petition states that Mrs. Courtney's
property in this State amounts to only
$2500 in personal property.
FIGHT'S Mills AN HOUR.
Rapid Run r.f a Train from Rock
Imlnnd to Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 9. â A rpcord
breaking run was made by the Rock
Island special train which brought back
the members of the Western Society of
Engineers from th-ir inspection trip to
the new steel bridge between Rock Island
and Davenport. The trip from Rock
Island to Chicago, a distance of 182 miles,
was made in exactly three hours and
for.y minnte?, the train leaving Rock
Island at 3:04 o'clock yesterday afternoon
arriving in Chicago at the Van Buren
street depot at 6:44 p. m.
Between Rock liland and Joliet sixty
miles an hour was made, and this time
would have been kept up through to Chi
cago but for the necessity of stopping at
various crossings and letting off passen
gers between Blue Island and the Van
Burei; street itation. The maximum
speed was reached between Sheffield and

What Eckel* Think*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 9. -The Her
ald contains a telegram from Comptroller
of the Currency Eckels at Washington in
which he predicts an era of prosperity if
Congress will refrain from radical changes
in tariff and currency matters. He thinks
that lepal tenders should be gradually re
tired, and that the National banks should
issue all the paper currency in the country,
which shou.d tie redeemable in cold. He
says that ihe defeat of free silver, com
bined with the economy in business that
ha come into effect Within ihe last three
years, has prepared the way for a per
manent revival of pnÂ«iness.
DYNAMITE IN THE BOX.
Peculiar Express Package Delivered to a
Prominent Long Island
Florist.
NEWPORT, L. 1., Nov. 9.â A. F. Schra
der, a prominent florist of this town, re
ceived a box by express yesterday which
he supposed contained seeds and buibs,
but w ich. after he had opened it with an
ax. he found to contain sufficient dyna
mite to blow up the whole town.
The box, which was delivered by Daly's
Express Company, is about two feet
square and weighs about fifteen pounds.
Mr. Schrader, after he got one or two of
the outside boards loose, discovered that
there was another box inside, packed care
fully with exctlsior. He still plied the ax
with vigor, and in the second box found a
third one enclosed with a zinc covering.
His ax had cut an opening in the zinc box
large enough to enable him to tear the
outside sheet away and disclose a large
number of tin boxes labeled "Rhenish Ex
plosive Company (Limited), Cologne, Ger
many."
Schrader saw that the boxes contained
dynamite and almost fainted with fright,
as the edge of his ax hud penetrated one
of the small tin boxes.
The address on the box is indefinite, it
being simply marked with a blue pencil,
"Fr. Schrader, Daly's Ex." Daly says
that be has no knowledge of the shipper
or where the box came from. He says it
was left at his office in New York by a
truckman, and, doing considerable busi
ness for Schrader, thought it belonged to
him.
Schrader would like to get rid of his
consignment, but no one will take it.' His
wife and daughter refuse to leave the
douse until the dangerous box and its
contents are removed from the yard.
The authorities believe there is a plot
on foot similar to the one that was dis
covered two years ago, when a large
amount of dynamite was found hidden
near the Whiting works in Maspeth.
At that time several anarchists were
arrested, but were discharged for lack of
evidence.

LACKAIE'S NEW PLAY.
Opena at Hooley'* Theater With an
Aggregation of Stmr*.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 9.â At Hooley's
Theater this evening Wilton Lackaye in
augurated his starring tour with every
evidence of complete success. The house

were all the members of his excellent
company.which includes such well-known
people as Marie Wainwrighl, C. W. Coul
dock, Forrest Robinson, Alice Evans, Car

Hampton and others. Mr. Lackaye's new
play, "Dr. Beigraff,"is one of exceptional
strength and contains no less than half a
dozen of the strongest scenes put into a
drama in late years. The author, Charles
Klein, is said to have far surpassed his
lormer great success, "The District Attor
ney." The new piece deals with hypno
tism, but on an entirely different basis
than did "Trilby," in which Mr. Lackaye
made so signal a triumph as Svengali.

AS ORE NEAR
GRAYS HARBOR
The British Bark Zinita
Stranded by Gale and
Current.
Carried High Upcn the Beach
Before Signaling Brings
Assistance.
CREW SAVED IN LIFEBOATS.
The Vessel's Commander B lieves It
Can Be Rescued From Its
Position.
ABERDEEN, Wash., Nov. 9.â During a
heavy gale and at an extreme high tide
early this morning the British baric Zinita
was driven ashore on the beach north of
Grays Harbor. The receding tide left the
vessel high and dry on the strand, where
it must remain until high water permits
tugs to approach and lend assistance.
Officers and crew reached the shore in
lifeDoats. The Ziuita was bound lor
Portland to load wheat and was forty
days out from Nagasaki, Japan. It first
sighted land eight miles off the Quinault
River yesterday forenoon. A man on
shore saw that the bark was flying signals
of distress and sent to Hoquiam for tow
boats. The tug Traveler from Westport
and others from South Bend were im
mediately sent, but did not arrive in time
to give help.
After the vessel struck the boats were
lowered and the crew of twenty-seven
men gained the snore. Seaman McNamee
waa struck over the head by a broken
stanchion and seriously injured. He was
taken to the hospital at Hoquiam. None
of the t>:hers were injured.
Captain James Frazier, who was in com
mand of the vessel, is of the opinion that
the Zinita can be saved without serious
damage. It is lying on the beach high
above the breakers.
This is the eijrhth foreign ship stranded
near Grays Harbor, drawn in by the
subtle current near there. To mak9 the
locality more dangerous there is no life
boat crew or lighthouse nearer than Wil
lapa Harbor, twenty-seven miles away.
The beach is of quicksand formation and
will soon suck in the hull of the Zinita if
it is not released from its position without
delay.
ALASKA MINING SCHEME,
Hydraulicking to Be Attempted
Along Resurrection
Creek.
New York Syndicate Will Establish
the First Plant in the
District.
TACOMA, Wash., Nov. 9.â J. P. Ladd
ot San Francisco, who represents a New
York syndicate, was among the passen
gers on the steamer Al-Ki, which arrived
to-day. He will return in the spring and
establish on Resurrection Creek the first
hydraulic-mining plant in that district.
The Al-Ki brought news of the sale of
the Horrible and Mexican lode claims in
the Berners Bay District by Frank Bach
to L. Nicholai of Portland. The price
was $60,000. of which one-fourth was paid
in cash. The mines have two well-defined
leoges, with over 400 feet of tunnels. The
ore assays $8 to $10 per ton in free cold.
The Al-Ki brought down 240 California
and Washington miners from Cooks Inlet,
who were left at Sitka over three weeks
ago by the steamer Excelsior. R. K. Lati
mer, one of these, is interested in stores at
Sunrise City and Hope City. There are
th rty-seven cabins at the latter piace, and
175 men will winter in both places.
Prices there, as Mr. Latimer quotes
them, are altogether reasonable. Flour is
$1 Â£.opÂ»rsack; sugar, 8 cents per pound;
bacon. 12 to 15 cents; hams, 12 to 16 cents ;
canned goods, such as corn and tomatoes,
12% cents p r can. There is one mail
each month, and papers aud letters are
eagerly looked for.
There is one substantial frame building
in Sunrise City and five in Hope. In the
former place the Alaska Commercial Com
pany has erected a tine lon store building
and carries a stock worth $15,000. The
general medium of exchange is gold dust,
ana everybody who has anything to sell
carries his scales.
STANFORD'S PLAY IMPROVING.
Varsity Team Candidates Training Hard
for the Thanksgiving Game
With Berkeley.
STANFOKD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Not.
9. â The freshmen are the most self-satis
fied people on the campus since their de
feat of their Berkeley rivals, and the re
sult has given the Varsity fresn encourage
ment for their game with Berkeley next
Thanksgiving. The big match is but lit
tle over two weeks distant now, and the
men recognize that in order to win they
will have to improve greatly before that
date. Until the middle of last week they
were all doing mediocre work at practice,
but the colder weather seemed to put some
snap into them and they are playing a
much more creditable came now.
Captain Fickert is still com| laininij that
the backs are too slow in starting and do
not display the life that they should. He
looks for marked improvement in this
direction during the interval before the
game. The interference is not what it
should be at this late date, the linemen,
with but two exceptions, seem to think
that the holding of an opponent is all
that can be expecteJ of them. Fkkert
throws himself into interference well,how
ever, and Cotton and Straight are doing
good work.
Practice will become more and more
rigorous as the time draws near for the
contest of the year. Twenty-five candi
dates are now on the training-table, and
secret signal practice will soon be given
daily in the gymnasium.
Manager Dave Brown to-day sent to
Berkeley the list ot man whom the regis

Cass Colvin on Trial for
Slaying His Sister's
Husband.
The Wid w Describes in Court
tne Tragedy at Sequoia
Mills.
KILLING OF EOBERT TOTTON.
His Throat Cut Whi c His Frenzied
Wife Gazed in Horror at the
Scene.
FREBNO, Cal., Nov. 9.â The introduc
tion of testimony in the tiial of Cass Col
vin, charged with the murder of his
brother-in-law, Robert L. Totton, at Se
quoia Mills, in the mountains, on the
evening of August 11, was begun this
morning.
The first witness was Mrs. Totton, wife
of the victim and sister of the murderer.
She testified as to how defendant had in
sulted her in the presence of her husband.
Totton resented the insults and the two
men procured clubs to fight.
Colvin threw his club at Totton and it
struck him. He then whipped out a razor
and ran for Totton, who broke his club
over the defendant's arm. The husband
of the witness then turned and ran, with
Colvin in pursuit, razor in hand. On the
front porch of their home, and in the
presence of the witness, Colvin caught
Totton and felling him to the ground cut
his throat. Mrs. Totton testified that she
pulled Colyin off her husband's prostrate
form, at which he was still viciously slash
ing with a razor.
After he had killed Totton tne mur
derer announced his intention of "fixing"
Mrs. Totton and started for her, brandish
ing his razor. A man arrived with an
ax, stopped him and he ran into the
woods.
The murder of Totton by Colvin was
one of the most revolting and cowardly
ever perpetrated in this county.
While the murderer was hiding under a
bridge only a few hundred yards from the
scene of the crime, hundreds of men from
the mills were scouring the surrounding
mountains with the avowed purpose of
lynching him. Colvin was finally starved
out, and under cover of darkness stole
from his hiding place and surrendered to
officers.

BARLOW BEATEN
IN THE SIXTH
Errors Discovered in the
Returns From Many
Precincts.
McLachlan Gains Ninety-Eight
Votes in a Portion of
Los Angeles.
EARLY CALCULATIONS UPSET.
Election of the Pasadenan Claimed by
the Republican Congressional
Committee.
LOS ANGELES, Cax., Nov. 9.âFusion
ist Barlow's friends, who have been claim
ing their candidate's election to succeed
McLachlan, appear to have been
counting ballots before they were taken
from the box. The officers of the Repub
lican Congressional Committee have ad
vices from the upper counties to the effect
that, because of errors in reporting returns,
McLachlan was represented as being be
hind, whereas it now seems that he has
been elected by 100 plurality. The report
ed complications are in Monterey and
Santa Cruz counties.
In Los Angeles County the Supervisors,
in reporting returns to-day, corrected
footings amounting to ninety-eight votes
in favor of McLachlan, with only a quarter
of the tally sheets covered.
Information of these gains having been
communicated to Congressman McLach
lan at his home in Pasadena, he at once
came to this city and to his office, where
he was called upon by numerous friends,
who expressed their belief that a fair
count would show him in the lead.
From a number of precincts in the
county and especially :n Precinct 2 of Pas
adena, the Republican candidate lost a
large number of votes by a most unusual
circumstance. It seem? "that the ink used
in supplying the stamping pads was of
the indelible kind which adhered in large
quantities to the bailot, and since no blot
ting pads were used to take up the sur
plus ink, it remained and when the ballots
were folded for depositing in the box a
crease occurred between McLachlan s and
Barlow's rames and the offset from the
ink in the McLachlan sqaares was con
spicuously visible in the Barlow squares
ns well. Tbis, on it* face, seemed to indi
cate that the citizen bad voted for both
candidates, and notwithstanding a close
inspection made the real reason perfectly
plain, the election board there acd else
where decided that the ballots should not
be counted for either candidate-
All such votes, as far as known, were
VcLechlan's loss. Leading lawyers claim
that in a contest these votes .would be
given to the Republican nominee because
of ihe evident intent on the part of the
voters. Mr. McLachlan by no means con
cede* his opponent's election, reports to
the contrary notwithstanding. To-day he
said :
"The face of the returns up to Friday
last indicated my defeat, but later reports
and corrected dguxes warrant the hope
that I may yet pull through, notwith
standing the 3500 "majority which stared
me in the face at tne beginning of tte
camtaicn."

PASADESa'S JOt UXCOXFIXED.
Â«*wy Xiff-ification of the Triumph of Mc-
Kinley and Protection.
PASADENA, Cal., Nov. 9.â Pasadena
was this evening, between the hour 3of 7
and 12, the scene of tbe m<">st unique and
enthusiastic demonstration in her his
toryâthe ratification of McKinley's elec
tion.
Pandemonium was let loose. Tbe peo
ple turned out en masse, with tin horns,
drums, bells, tomtoms and every ear
splitting device known. The Americas
Club in full uniform, 200 in number,
marcbed ttie streets, led by a drum and
bng.e corps and the Pasadena band. It
wa3 followed by 150 members of the Patri
otic League in uniform aud hundreds of
citizens and small boy^. Twenty young
business men, armed wivfa shotguns, kept
up almost continuous tiring as ihe proces
sion passed along. At intervals carts upon
which red fire was burned were drawn by
boys and decorated with tiaes. The streets
were crowded with men, women and chil
dren, each viemsr with tne other in shout
ing, while cannon and anvils addei to the
din. Fireworks and skyrockets were iet
loose, and the wdole town apparently
could find no sufficient outlet for the joy
over ilcKinley's election.
A general round-up was made at Hay
marfcet square, where fireworks and
speeches were in order, everybody present
contributing to the celebration with con
stant applause and noise.
SOLANO OUT-TV CONTEST.
Raleigh Barcar ltxsposed to Fight for a
Senatorial Seat.
SUiSTN*. Cal., Nov. 9.â The Board of
Supervisors met to-day to canvass the
Solano County election returns. They
had recorded but o:ie precinct when
Raleigh Barcar, the defeated candidate
for State Senator on the Democratic
ticket, suggested to the chairman of the
board that the unused oaliots be inspected
before passing on returns.
Chairman McGettigan demanded of
County Clerk Halliday the delivery of the
ballots in question. Charles Newman,
chairman of the Republican County Cen
tral Committee, protested vigorously, and
after a short but heated discussion (he
clerk announced thaf he would not deliver
the ballots. The Board of Supervisors,
being Democratic by one majority, it was
Decided on a majority vote to proceed no
further unless Clerk Hailiday acceded to
its demand.
Wnile the â¢wrangling was going on Mr.
Barcar drew up a writ of mandate asking
Superior Judge Buckles to order the clerk
to deliver to the Boarl of Supervisors ali
unused ballots, the ballot stubs and re
jected ballots. P strict Attorney Devlin
appeared for the defendant and the case
was heard at once. The court held that
it was cot the duty of tbe canvass
ing board to determine whether tbe
ballots sent out had a:i been used and
accounted for; that the election board
must put the uncounted ballots In the
packages containing the other voted bal
lots, and these packages could not be
opened, and as the c.'erk had not refused
to perform any duty required of him by
law the writ was denied.
As the unofficial returns gave J. J.
Luchsinger, the Republican nominee, but
9 majority, it appears from remarks
dropped by Democratic politicians to-day
that Mr. Barcar will contest his election.
When the canvassing board had ad
journed this evening the returns of but
thirteen precincts had been counted, re
sulting in no changes in the results as
announced already. The precincts ai
ready counted are those in Vailejo and
Benicia townships.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1596
DEATH STRIKES IN
SAN BERNARDINO
Colonel Andrew B. Paris
Succumbs to Bright's
Disease.
The End Hastened by a Cold
Contracted During the Late
Campaign.
SOLDIEB, LAWYER AHD FRIEND
His Passing Brings Sorrow to tbe
People of an Entire Com
munity.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Nov. 9.â
After a two weeks' iilness, Colonel An
drew B. Paris died in this city to-day. He
wa3 the fusion candidate for Superior
Judge at the lat9 election, and, while cam
paigning on the desert, caught a severe
cold, but the real cause of his death was
Bright's disease. Since Friday he had
beea very iow and there was little hope of
his ultimate recovery. His suffe-ings
were intense, and while under the influ
ence of opiates at 9:30 this morning he
passed away as though falling into Â« gen
tle sleep.
Colonel Andrew B. Paris was born in
Virginia in 1539 and was educated in the
Virginia Military Institute, from which
he was graduated in l&jO. Upon the break
ing out of the war he enlisted in the Con
federate army, served four years, rose to
the rank of colonel and at the close of
hostilities was chief of artillery of General
Hoke's division of General Joseph E.
Johnston's army. After the war he studied
law in the University of Virginia and was
admittel to the bar in 1566. Locating in
Charlotte County, Virginia, he practiced
his profession until 1873.
In 1574 Colonel Paris came to California
and settled in San Bernardino, and he has
been actively and prominently connected
with tbe bar of the county ever since, and
has been employed in some of tne most
noted cases tried in local courts. His
special strength was in the trial of crimi
nal causes. In 15SS he was elected Prose
cuting Attorney of San Bernardino County
ior two years, and was recognized as one
of the most efficient prosecutors who ever
filled that office. As a local orator Colonel
Paris was very popular, and his services
were usually in dfjnand on all occasions
wnere terse, pithy speeches were in order.
On August iO, 1889, he was joined in
marriage with th<? daughter of Colonel
Larkin Smith of Virginia, an estimable
lady whom he had known from child
hoo i, but only a short period of domestic
happine>s was to be tbeir lot, for on the
27th of July in tfce following year Mrs.
Paris died.
Two years ago Colonel Paris ran for
Attorney-General of the State on tbe
Democratic ticket but was defeated, and
his next political venture was hb race for
the Superior Judgeship at tbe recent elec
tion, in which he was likewise defeated.
Ihe news of Colonel Paris' death this
morning was reoeiveU with the greatest
possible regret and sorrow by all San
Bernardino people. Good nature, affa
bility and courteous treatment of every
body were distinguishing characteristics
of Colonel Paris, and no citizen enjoyed
the personal love and esteem of tbe citi
r.ens of Sau Bernardino to a greater ex
tent than he.
To-day the Bar Association held a meet
ing and decided to attend tbe funeral in a
body and appointed a committee to pre
paie resolutions relating to bis life and
death. On motion of Superior Judge-
Elect Frank Oster, court adjourned this
aiternoon out of respect tor the memory of
Colonel Paris. Mr. Oster was Colonel
Paris' opponent in the late campaign. The
funeral will take place on Wednesday at 2
o'clock. The Knights of Pythias will tave
charge of the obsequies, assisted by the
Woodmen of the Worid and the Bar Asso
ciation.
PORTLAND INVENTION.
Se/f-Propet/ing Engine Said to Have Been
in Constant Operation for Four
Years.
PORTLAND, Oh., Nov. 9.â Paul Heil
brun, an employe of the Southern Pacific
Company, claims ne has solved the
problem of perpetual motion. This
creator â for he cannot be classed as an in
ventorâsays that in 1891 he perfected an
engine that ran 365 successive days by air
generated through its own motion.
At tne expiration of that time it ceased
operation because of a scarcely perceptiDle
leakage in one of th c air-generative tubes.
It was three months ere he discovered
this trouble. Now, he says, the engine
has been running four years withont ces
sation by the self-generating air process
alone.
'â¢None but my wife and myself have set
eyes uoon my great York," said Mr. Heil
brun to-day, "and none shall, till I return
from Washington City with a patent. I
j shall endeavor to patent every minute
' detail of my work so as to
â  escape future litig-atiou with imitators.
I Regarding my work I'll say this without
basnfulness, that it will supersede elec
tricity and steam. Tbe generation of air,
according to my process, costs nothing,
and my engine will ceaselessly operate till
it is physically worn out. That s practi
cally perpetual motion, isn't it?''
Mr. He.-brun predicts that in the course
of a few years engines after his own model,
but witft improvements suggested by bril
liant creative minds, Â«iil supplant all
other motive power. His enthusiasm
leads him to prophesy that before the dose
of the current century ocean steamships
and transcontinental railway trains will
be operated t>y this power, and with much
j more safety than by steam or electricity.
Mr. Heilbrun is now past 60' years of
I age, and when the kiea hrst struck him
that tbe construction of a perpetual
motion engine was a possibility he had a
fortune of $40,000. All this, 'besides bis
spare earnings, he exhausted in experi
i mentinpr, and in visir.ng others riding the
same hobby in other parts of the worid,
wherever hs believed lie could learn some
thing.

of the State of Arizona Improvement
Company against the Board of Control of

tract for leasing prison labor by ex-Gov

STOCKTON. Cal., Nov. 9.â The ten
Chinese who were arrested yesterday for
the murder of Sue Jack at Staten Island
were discharged to-day for want of evi
dence.
The inquest developed the fact that two
pistols of different caliber were used in
tbe murder of the gardener. It is believed
now by tbe rfhcerÂ» that the slavers of Sue
Jack came from San Francisco and were
able to get away after the killing.
Tbe ten Chinese under arrest testified
that they were afraid to go outside of tbeir
caDin after they heard the shots fired, and
for this reason they did not see the mur
derers of their employer.?
The Sheriff's othce is still at work on tbe
case and the aid ot the San Francisco de

tion.
FREED AT LOS ANGELES
Three -American Railway Union
Leaders Released From
Prison.
Pardoned by President Cleveland
Aft?r Nearly a Year of
Captivity.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 9.â The de
termined and persistent efforts of organ
ized labor of Southern Calif*. 'nia in be
half of Philip Stanwood, William H. Clnne
and Isaac Ross, convicted of detaining
tbe United States mu.ls here during the
railway strike of H'J4. confined in the Los
Angeles County Jail, have been crowned
with success. Â»
â¢ Scores of petitions had gone to the ex
ecutive department of the Governmen t
at Washington without producing' the
slightest result The last petition was
given in charge of Samuel Gompers, presi
dent of the National Federated Trades,
and was. addressed to the Department of
Justice. This petition seems to have beÂ«n
effective and to-day an order for the re
lease of these men reached this city, the
President pardoning all of them.
-The pardoned mÂ«n had been in jail here
lot nearly"; a year ( after a memorable trial
in the GiiEte<rjsfatÂ«Â« District CourtrJud^e
Ross presiding*.'* TEe sentence he impoWd
had afterward been confirmed by the
Supreme Court. The sentence was a fine
of $1 and eighteen months in the County
Jail of Los Angeles County. â  "
The men were all members of the Ameri
can Railway Union, Stanwood being presi
dent of the local lodge of the order. They
were employes of the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company as trainmen, and
were pursued with relentless rigor, until
convicted. Their guilt,- if guilty at all,
consisted of "const rnctlve" obstruction
of the United States mails in refusing
to handle trains partly made ,up of Pull
man cars, although it was then and is now
well known that no mail of any descrip-
was ever carried on a Pullman car.
None of these men took part '; in any
overt act against the road or any employe,
and their sentence for "constructive" guilt
is probably without a parallel in the his
tory of jurisprudence in the United States.

EXAMINERS MEET
AT THE CAPITOL
Claims Against the State
Passed Upon by the
Board.
Coyote-Scalp Frauds Allowed
to Rest Until Next
Thursday.
AFFILIATED COLLEGES CASE.
Buid Suggests a Modification of tbe
Ruling Regarding Use of
State Rock.
SACRAMENTO, Cal.. Nov. 9. â The
State Board of Examiners met to-day and
considered various claims against the
State. Major Black of the Seventh Regi
ment presented a bill of $46 50 for saiary
ana expenses while attending the funeral
of Lieutenant-Governor Millard, and it
was allowed. Ed F. Ingalls. the brave en
gineer who prevented tne looting of a
train near Davisville some time since, by
snooting one of the robbers and running
his train into Sacramento at full speed,
presented a claim in the sum of $300, and
it was recommendert to the attention of
the coming Legislature.
The State Bureau of Highways requested
permission to sell its span of horses. The
animals bad cost $100 and were purchased
with the idea that it would be cr.eaper to
buy and Bell at the end cf the season than
to rent a team during the summer. It
was granted permission to sell for any
amount over JHt otherwise to turn the
animals out to pasture.
Referring to the opinion rendered by
Attorney-General Fitzgerald that Folsom
rock could not be used in the Affiliated
Colleges building in Snn Francisco, Gov
ernor Budd said "to Attorney-General Fitz
gerald that be did not believe that ail tbe
facts had been laid before the Attorney-
GeneraL Fitzgerald said this might be
true; all be had to do was to pass upon
the contract as presented to him, and he
had done this, and his opinion was in
strict accordance with the law. Governor
Budd said he did not donbt that, but he
intended having a^ the papers in the case
presented to see if the opinion could not
be modified.
Prior to the opening of the session of the I
Board of Examiners there was a general ;
discussion of this question of the Affiliated i
Colleges. The contractor who was to build i
the stricture had thrown $10,000 oft the I
contract price, provided he could use Stale i
rock, and.it had been so ordered. The
decision of the Attorney-General at this j
time that the iock cannot be legally used,
as It comes into competition with free i
labor, has mixed things up considerably. !
In the matter of coyote claims Governor
Budd said there was no question but that
gross frauds had been committed in Fresno ;
County. In 1891 but 1700 scalps had been
turned in. In IS9Z they numbered 2300,
wniie in the last quarter of 1Â£94 1561 scalps
bad been presented. The claims from Tv- ;
lare, Madera : and Kern counties also re
quired investigation, and he was in favor
of throwing all these claims aside with, j
the rocominendation that the Legislature' ,
investigate them. ."-* .. . -" ; . .\. .
.Secretary, of State \ Brown was in favor j
of investigating ail the counties, but the :
Governor said that while some of the !
counties' claims for scalps bore fraud on i
their face others gave no indication of
fraud. Among these was A.ime Ja County.
He added that his idea was to have the

investigate the claims and - to pay them, '
and give the board power to investigate

Brown said there was sufficient money :
on hand to make the investigations now,

poned until next Thursday, as was also !
the consideration of an offer of $150,000 j

Fitzgerald said that he had been asked by

they could use : money appropriated to
prevent contagious diseases for the pur
pose of paying the expenses of trios East :

them- he believed they could, .provided
they stated in their claims that the money
was expended : in gathering information

There was an informal discussion of

in which he compelled her to live, and
that she refused to have anything to do
with him. Bosquet drew a revolver from
his pocket, and. placing it against his
wife's left ear, puiled the trigger and <he

It Brings Forth Strange Fact* in a
Court at San Rafael.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal . Nov. 9.-An unex
pected delay occurred in the probating of
the will of Mrs. .Marion M. Ailen. before
Judge Angeiotti this morning, owing
to ti.e obstreperous conduct of J. M.
Shawnan, one cf the witnesses to the will,
who evidently desired to administer on
the estate.
Samuel M. Sbortridge, was Mrs.
Allen's attorney for many years, appeared
as executor of* the will, at some incon
venience to himself, and with the full ap
proval of Dr. Richards, son-in-law of de
ceased, and of her daughters; but Shaw
han's memory as to the details of the exe
cution of the'wili seemed groggy.
For some reason at the time not apparent
he seemed very forgetful, whereupon At
torney Shortridge addressed the court,
saying that he was willing for any suit
able person on whom the parties inter
ested could agree to act as executor. He
cared nothing for the fees and commis
sions, he said, concluding:
"Tbere are duties we owe to the living,
but there are more sacred duties we owe
to the dead. AÂ« I delended Mrs. Allen in
money matters in life, it is my legal duty
to carry out her wishes as best i can, now
that she is dead." I
The case went over for two weeks, at
which time Mr. Shortridge will make due
proof of the will.
Mrs. Allen was the widow of Henry H.
Allen, a well-known mining man, who
died several years aÂ»o. She contested her
husband's wi:l and was represented by
Dennis Spencer, and afterward by Mr.
Shortridge. A surprise to the clamoring
sons-in-law was tbe appearance of a little
granddaughter as claimant to a quarter
of the estate. She was represented by At
torney Louis Hoefier, whu wanted Mr.
Shortridge to continue as executor.

British Columbian cities ready to marry
suitable mates possessed of means enough

Every one is familiar with the shrunken >

thin legs and towed form, the changed
tone of the voice ana the weak action of
the bodily organs. FeW oid people are
equal to "tbe muscular effort of earlier

taste and appetite lose their keenness. IÂ«
it not sad ?
And yet there are thousands of old peo

They have the strength to keep them up.

The above is only one 01 hundreds of

AT THE THEATERS
"Darkest Russia" Well Re
ceived at the Cali
fornia.
D?lla Fcx Made a Hit in "The
Little Troopsr" at the
Baldwin.
MAY BUCKLEY IN A NEW EOLE.
Gcrinne Repeated H r Success in
"Hendrick Hudson Jr."-The
, â¢ Dog Orchestra.
A glance last night round the big house
at the Baldwin, which turned out to greet
..Delia Fox as a star, showed conclusively
that the election excitement is all over
and that audience.* are returning to the
theatrical fold.
'â¢The Littie Trooper, 1 which Miss Fox
chose as the vehicle for tier appearance,
â¢was modestly described in the programme
ias a French vaudeville operetta, by Ray
fr. id and Mars, adapted by Clay M.
Mjireene, and set to music by William Furst
and Victor Roger.
The plot is an amusing tissue of ab
surdities, which arise from a dashing of
ficer in '.he hussars passing off his ex
sweethcart as his wifo rather Uian face
the painful duty of telling her that he
U already married to another. The
lawful spouse, of course, appears on the
scene, and finding "Our' Wife," as she
scornfully calls the ex-Â«weet heart, already
in possession, she vows to make it hot for
her husband, and tucceeds most perfectly
in her design, though incidentally she
also has a red-hut time hersell. Part of
her plot is carried out by disguising her
self as an officer of the gallant Thirteenth
Hussars, ar.d one of ncr first achieve
ments in donning her uniform is to fight
a duel.
The music woven round this plot is
catchy and tuneful, some of the choruses
'are particularly pretty, and the finale of
tLe second act was rapturously encored.
There was no doubt about the hit that
Delia Fox made last night as the lawful
wife oi (Japtam Emile Dnval. Both in
appearance and style of acting she wakes
memories of Mrs. De Wolf Hopper,
though people who first saw Delia as a
star say it is ju^t the other way about, and
that Edna ac Wolf Hopper evokes memo
ries of Miss Fox. However that may be,
Delia Fox lias even more snap and ginger
than Mrs. Hopper â there is more of tier and
more power to her voice. She warbles in
the vaudeville style, though her staying
is by no means unpleasant to listen
to; indeed, some of her upper
notes are very sweet. In the
scenes where she played the vixen with
her husband she showed herself to be a
genuine artist in her own line, and people
in the audience whispered to one atiothar,
"How cute," ana "How fetching." Delia
is graceful, too, and her duet and dance
with Harry Macdonough are among the
best hits of the evening.
Hugh Cbilvers looked the role of Emile
Du'val to perfection, and his acting was
iairly good. He is handsome, particularly
to when he shows his teeth. Mr. Chilvers
appeared to realize this fact, for he wore
Â»an almost perpetual smile, which at times
was more becoming to himself.tnan %j the
situation. He has a pleasant barytone
voice, whicn he uses weil, except that he
indulges in a tedious amount of tremolo.
Harry Macdonough as Lieutenant
G bard was the freak of the performance.
He plavecl his part as a cripple anil wore
odd buois to emphasize his deformity.
How such a fearful and wonderful old geu
tieman ever fought his way into the French
army was not explained, but his antics
provided plenty of amusement for the
audience. He tripped the liuht fantastic
toe round all the ladies, and told them in
a very pleasant tenor voice that he loved
tl:em, and people laughed at the very
absurdity of the exhibition.
. Charles Dunpan, who was been warmly
welcomed by his many San Francisco
friends, played the part of the colonel
well and sang its s-ongs well, too. Nellie
Beaegins was charming as the ex-sweet
heart who iiad not the least idea she
was'doing wrong when she told the cap
tain she loved him. The rest of the cast
was satisfactory. The chorus and scenery
were good, and altogether "The Little
Trooper" made quite a success.
â¢â¢In Darkest Ruiaia."
The many people who attended the opening
of the California last evening saw Russia in
two grand scenes. First in the palace of
a nobleman, surrounded by all ihe glitter,
the. grandeur and the Imperial glory of the
Czar. Here is the awful, the ponderous
power that b-ways millions of people spread
ing across the upper portion of me Eastern
Hemi.^phere. The next is Siberieâ the dreary
ard eternal winter ot the abode of the exiles
tnrust away tc grovel un<ler the fierce diÃ
j.leasure of tho autocrat. One hears the clank
ot chains and the trea-i of the merciless guards
us the long, gray line of wretched beings Me
over ti;e Irozen steppe.
I ."Darkest Ku^sia" is a strong play of love,
hatred, revenge, nihilistic plots Dec iin on tbe
â¢ banks of the Neva and continued across
the snowy wastes into the farthest garters
of the Empecor's dominions. Ilua Ba
-k.v. the daughter ot an exile. Is
introduced into the palace of Count
.'-i.zimoff as a member of the orchestra. She
â¢vises io play 'God Save the Czar" and is
about to be punished, when she is nescued by
the son of the nobleman and an American
colonel, Septimus Cobb. The young man is her
Jover; and following her to her abode, becomes
mixed up in a company of nihilists. There
he learns that his promised wife, a uoble
lady. OlpÂ» Karsicheff, is the vtiie of llda's
brother. Oae of the Dsst scenes of the piece Is
where Olga's mother persuades her husband
to exile the voting man, who refuses her
daughter, io Si'oeria, and a Jew moments after
She unintentionally induces his father to
banish her own daughter, literally turning
the tables on the malignant woman.
Her husband is soon deprived of his office as
Mniisuer of Police and ordered to the com
mand of a penal post in Siberia. There all
the characters meet, and Uic wre'.ched exiles
are protected and rescued by the courtier of
\hÂ» Czar.
What litt<e humor there is in "Darkest Kus
s;r' is played by Colonel Cobb aud Mme.
Carine Jordan, and he, In her appreciative
term (learned frr>nÂ» him), "'take* ze<J cake."
Mi.-s Herman carries well her difficult role of
the revengeful woman, ever pursuing the ob
jects of her hatred.
The staging of the piece is magnificent; the
scenery is palnUd irotn photographs takeu In
Russia. The orchestral music is sprightly,
though contrasting with the somber settings
of latter portions of the play. "LMrkeht
â¢Russia" will be given all the evenings of thrf
week, Sunday included; also next Saturday
afternoon.
Columbia Theater.
"Hendrick Hudson Jr.," which was pre-
Eented to a Celiforcia audience lor the 6econd
time in tne Colombia Theater last evening. Is
a success. C.rinne made herself popular
when, or. being presented with a pretty floral
piece, she modestly remarked, 'I like theÂ»o
jolkÂ«." She was evidently sincere, and me
Â»Â»'Jlenre applauded in gratitude.
â  The tliy is In reality an operatic extrava-
WÂ»i>za. It soarklfs with witty non&enw, good
<â  and <iune rlever a< ting.
\ne Cawthorn, lnte princionl romedtan with
VtLlr. Rosa, has mastered a brogue which
greatly pleued all, and John Page and Neil
McNeil, who played the parts of detective*.,
nnmed Sherlock and Holmes respectively, fur
nished nonsense that was a novelty.
John Park, an eminent younÂ«r barytone; Oc
tdvie Barbe, a prima donnaof HÂ»yt's "A Trip
to Chinatown" fame; N.-Uie SincklaiKl and
Aunie HutchimoD, wuo Imilt up reputations
n Charles Frohman's companies, and Helen
Hoiden Welsh, all appeared at their best.
Tho play was well received, and without
Ooubt will secure its share of patronage dur
ing the week.
Grand Opera-House.
At the Grand last night nnother of Captain
Herue's plays, "The Minute Men," was erected
by a large house. It is a war-time drama and
full of stirring events and patriotic senti
ments.
The date of the openinc action is the time
just preceding the battle of Bunker Hill.
-Miss Bateman represents Dorothy,* country
girl who has been brought up by Reuben as
his own child, but is found to he the daughter
of Sir Frederick Sheiton, a colonel of the
English army.
Leslie mak';s a handsome officer and a pretty
but unsuccessful lover to Dorothy, who loves
Koanoke, the Indian.
The play is a Kuccession of exciting seenca,
and the intereit is well kept up by a very ca
pable company. The comic bits were afforded
by Julia Blanc as Anne Campbell.
Howard Kyle played Roanoke, the Indian,
very effectively. Mortimer Snow was good as
Ned Winthrop, and Miss Anna Daly made
quite a hit as Kachel Winslow.
At tho Orpheum.
Aa amusing new feature of the Orpheum
last night was the dog orchestra, consisting
of a number of nccomplished amines who
wielded musical instruments with more or
less dexterity.
The orchestra was playing while the dogs
were making their music, so It was difficult to
say just how much they contributed in the
way of sound, but there whs no doubt about
tbe zeal and energy of the canine arummer;
he beat his ins.rument with a will and got
sound out of it.
A number of good acts from last week are
still on the bill. Mays and Hunter continue
to give interesting banjo selections, the Horn
Brothers appear to be as popular as ever, Kel
son, (ilinsueti and Demonio continue their re
markable feats of contortion and the rest of
the bill is good.
At the Alrazar.
Last evening the Alcazar Stock Company
gave Henry Hamilton's emotional drama,
'â¢ Reaping tne Harvest," to a full bous\
Tho performance was on the whole
quite satisfactory and brought out all
of the strength of the casr, which included
John T. Sullivan, Frauds Powers, Gordon Fos
ter, Charles P. Bates. K. B. Clayton, Beatrice
Leib, May Buckley, Mrs. F. M. Bates, Josephiiie
Gnshmau an<l l)aisy Orogan.
The piece Is a littie serious love story laid in
Wales, .-cot land, and Irelandâ intense without
being high. y dramatic and pathetic without
being lamentable, and the slight humor scat
tered here ar.d there serves to take the edge
from the more solemn paits. It wiU be con
tinued all the week.
At the Chutes.
The Illuminated aerial bicycle rides of Arion
out at the Chutes arc still proving an immense
attraction on pleasant evenings. When it is
damp the skating-rink serves to bring visitors.
The anlmatoscope had a number of new pro
jections thrown on the screen in the Casino
last night, and its original claim of being "su
perior to the vitascope" is being now proved.
Zeisler Recital.
Mme. Fannie Ityoomtield Zeisler, the cele
brated pianiste, will make the acquaintance
of ihe concert-goers of this City this evening
at Metropolitan Temple. An excellent pro
gramme is promised. Mme. Zeisler will give

T. A. Kennedy.Uhe humorous hypnotist, con
tinues to afford plenty of amusement for au
diences at tne Bush-street Theater.
WHEAT JUMPS AGAIN,
A Short Crop Seems in Order
in All Wheat-Producing
Countries.
Deficiencies in India, Australia md
Russia Make Prices Strong
Everywhere.
Wheat took another rise yesterday, and
prices ranged from $1 45 to $1 47} i for
choice and $1 52% for extra choice for
milling. All conditions point to good
prices for some time to come.
One after another come reports of disas
ters to the crops of the great wheat-pro
ducing countries. It was known some
time ago that there was a shortage in the
Indian crop, but the deficiency is now
deemed very serious. Yet brokers do not
seem to be sanguine of any great importa
tions into that coxintry.
The failure in -India and Australia has
created a deficiency of 2,033,500 quarters
in Great Britain alone. This must be
made up from other sources, and the
United States will come in for the bulk of
the trade. To California farmers it means
a great revival in business.
Ti:e last report comes from RusÂ«ia.
where the autumn teed ins is vastly re
tarded by drought and extensive cold
weather. Such continued drawbacks as
these keep the market at fever heat.
The rise in the local market yesterday
was largely due to sympathy with reports
of advances iv quotations from Chicago
and Liverpool. Wueat broke the record
at Chicago in price* yesterday by selling
for December at 80'^ centa.
"The outlook for the farmers of this
State," baid a local broker yesterday, "is
exceedingly bright. Along with the ru
mors of tbe untoward circumstances at
tending the fall seeding of Russia and
France comes the news that there is a
threatened damage to the Argentine crop.
Corn, oats and provisions generally have
risen in price, and even beans have a
strong upward tendency."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1896.
BREAKING THE
BALLOT SEALS
The Election Commission
Begins Its Work of
Recount.
Defeated Candidates Watch and
Hopefully Take Private
Tally.
SEVERAL CLOSE CONTESTS.
In Ab ut Half of th?* Precincts Ccunted
the Pap rs Were Found
Unsigned.
Yesterday morning the Election Com
mission fluttered in through the doors of
the Boara of Education chamber and
sadly contemplated a pile of big envelopes
that lay on the tables, ornamented with
daubs ot red sealing-wax. A number of
candidates, who apparently had been
found wanting in ballots, ranged them
selves around the room and with pencil
and paper and with a hope that a few dis
covered errors would change the com
plexion of affairs to a less somber hue,
prepared to keen their private tallies. A.
Huefand Stephen O'Keefe, who may not
be a Police Judge this time, watched
closely the totals as the official seals were
broken. Registrar Hinton sat wearily
back against the wall, with an "Oh-I
have-siKhed-to-rest-me" expression in his
attitude.
Mayor Sutro came in early, but tho
voice of Harry Cresweli calling off the
figures in a rolling monotone soon fa
tigued him, and the stoned white over
coat floated ghostly away down the dim
corridor. Tbe patriarchal crest of Judge
Campbell appeared at the door, and the
ninny smile of the re-elected Police mag
istrate brightened the wintry gloom of
the place and made the defeated ones for
get their sadness. The Judge could laugh
hrst and last, for no official recount can
hope overturn his 30,000 votes.
The returns of the Thirty-first and
Thirty-ninth Assembly districts, which
are the Twenty-third Senatorial District,
were watched closely by the friends ot
Tyrrell, Hall and Welch, as there are
only 23 ballots between the two first Sena
torial candidates, and a clerical error
made on a precinct tally-sheet may turn
defeat into victory. Hall will watch his
precious 1653 ballots, Tyrrell will trust
that a lucky turn in the tide will move his
(JW up a number of numbers and Welch
will pray that bis score of Hill will swell
and swell till a seat in the upper legis
lative house at Sacramento will bÂ« his
very own. In the Thirty-tifih Senatorial
District there is a difference of 65 votes,
Dolan having 1238 and Hedemark 1173,
and these returns will not escape consid
erable notice on the part of the riv&l
aspirants to the Senatorial toga.
The count began at the First Precinct of
the Twenty-eighth District and proceeded
swiftly to the Eighth Precinct of the
Thirty-fitst. About one-half oi the re
turns were placed back in their envelopes
on account of clerical errors and too pre
ciact oilers citei to appear this after
noon and explain why tally-sheets and
poll-lists were sent in unsigned, and why
dty and general returns were sealed in
the wrong envelopes.
No material error 3 were found, and as
yet no changes are on the record, so the
winners may continue to take easy breaths
at this xtage of the work.
The First and Second Precincts of the
Twenty-eighth District were not counted,
the Third wnt all right, the Fourth un
signed, the Fith, Sixth and Seventh cor
rect, and the Eighth poll-list had no sig
natures. It was the same in the Eleventh,
Fourteenth, Sixteenth and S-venteenth.
In the Twentv-ninih District the Sixth,
Ninth, Tenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth and
Kixieenth precincts were unsigned, and in
the Thirtieth District the Eighth, Tweifth
and Seventeenth were put aside for the
same cause. In the Thirty-first District
the Eighth Precinct ooil-list was without
the needed signatures also.
In several of the precinct' the industri
ous clerks had copied tbe poll-lists, writ
ing in the names alpbabetcally after the
votine was finished, an unnecessary task.
Often the lists showed that Presidential
electors of the set of nine were short one or
two crosses, proving that the voter had for
gotten to stamp each name, or had grown
weary of the great task of putting down
his mark.
The recount will begin again this morn
ing at G o'clock, and it is thought that
several weeks will pass before the task is
finished. The commission will rapidly
run through the general ticket, but the
real labor will commence when it takes up
the voluminous bundles of municipal
ballots.
MUSIC THE YEAR ROUND
A P:an Is On Foot to Have
Permanent Symphony
Concerts.
It May Ev:ntually L?al to the Es
tab'ishing in This S ate of a Con
servatory of Music.
William L. Greenbaum, business man
acer of the Hinrichs-Beel symphony con
certs, has a surprise in store for the lovers
of music. It is a plan matured by him
and others to secure for this City s perma
nent symphony orchestra.
In speaking of the affair last evening
Mr. Greenbaum said:
"Next Friday at the Ecel concert the
proposition will be presented to the 300
subscribers to bring in a couple of hun
dred more, the subscription ol 50 cents to
be paid nionthlv.
"With this $250 each month we will be
able to rive a guarantee to such leaders as
Scheel. Thomai, Ma?cagni and others to
come to this coast. As a starter we would
be in a position to retain Gus Hinrichs for
the first season. As matters stand now
we are only favored for a few weeks at a
time with symphony concerts and then
comes a long interim, duri-ig which for
lack of funds we must do without. The
subscription plan we now propose will
permit of concerts during the entire year,
and should there be a surplus it could be
applied to the starting of a conservatory
of tntuie in connection with our Stale
University.
"Subscribers in addition to having good
music at nil 'times would, of course, get
some benefit of a pecuniary kind in tbe
matter of admission rates."
Appeal for Collections.
A parlor meeting will be held early next
: month by the Ran Francisco Orphanage and
i Farm at the residence of Miss Julian E. Carey.
'2603 Stelner street. The object of the meeting

of weeks the farm donated by Mrs. Pbcebe
| Hesrst, at Faiitax, will be transterred to the
| orphanage, aud it is hoped to begin building
soon after. At the meeting of the directors
held yesterday it wns resolved to appeal to the
churcnes for the I'resbyteriau share of the col

An appeal is also to be made for Christmas

BRUIN NOT HAPPY.
Market Street KnUvened by the Pres
eiice of a Wild Bear From
the Noi th.
A small black bear woke tho echoes on
Market street late yesterday afternoon.
He was fresh from the north ana he was
as savage as any beast could be. His
demonstrations were limited only by his
strength. Being only a cub, stout rope?,
doubled, were sufficient to hold him in an
express wagon in which he rode on the
way to Butchertown, where he will be
fattened, with two brother bears, for
Christmas.
The man who drove the span of horses
fastened to tbe bear waÂ«con did noi look
comfortable. His ursine comrade came
too near him with threatening teeth and
ugly claws. Crowds saw the unusual
a.gJit of a real wild bear on Market street.
PUGS ARE EXCITED.
A Heavy neniumi for Good Fifttlc Tul-
entâ Matches That Have
Been Made.
The National Club has signed "Snider"
Kelly and Finnic*, "the Arkansas kid,"
to box ten rounds at 135 pounds on the
evening of tho Carroll and McAuliffe
fight. Finnick has defeated some good
men and he has many admirers among
the sporting fraterni'.y. Kelly crawled
out of what gave promise of being pretty
hot lights of late, and the sports are in
clineu to think that he will find some
way of avoiding a meeting with Finnick
by offering a sprained knuckle or a bruised
toe as an excuse lor a. postponement.
McAuliffe was in town last evening, and
after a consultation with Manager Gibbs
ufthe St. George's Club the date of his
fignt with Jimmy Carroll was changed
from November 18 to >.ovember2o. Cham
pion Jack is looking Brat class, notwith
standing some reports to the contrary.
He contends that he will put up the live
liest Kind of a ten-round mill with his old
opponent. Some bets have already been
made that he will whip Carroll inside of i
ten rounds.
The managers of the National Ciub are
now figuring upon matching Fred Muller j
and Lon Agnew for a ten-round contest, i
which, if consummated, will precede the
big right on the evening of December 2.
George Green and Danny i>eedham are
matched to tight ten rounds at catch I
weights on the evenin.' of December 18. i
It was reported mat the National Club
will nign Jeffriets of Los Angeles to tight
Vnn Buslcirk of the Olympic Club to-day.
In case the pugilists will come to an un
derstanding with the club in question,
the contest will be slated to taitÂ« place
some time m tbe middle of December.

by Policeman Wagner against Police
court "grafiers" who infest tha Larkin
street corridor of the City Hall. Yester
day morning lie arrested William Gaffney,
a lawyer's clerk, who M a familiar figure
in the corridor. Gaffney was released on

For a few weeks prior to the election the
"grafters" became bold, as they contended

ished. Now thai the election is over
Policeman Wagner has decided that they
have lost their influence and will accord
ingly arrest every one till the corridor is
aosolutely free frem their presence.

HEBBARD'S FOES
ARE TO BE TRIED
Judge Daingerfield Over-
rules the Demurrer
of Williams.
All the Defendants Must Answer
to the Grand Jury's In
dictments.
IMPORTANT DECISION GIVEN.
"Falsely and Knowingly to Impute In
competency to a Judge Is
Libelous "
"LiOts of people said the cases against
Judge Hebbard's defamers would be
dropped as soon as the election was
over, but they will h'nd out their mistake
before they get through," exclaimed At
torney Julius Kahn yesterday.
Judge Daingerheld had jtist delivered
his decision overruling the demurrer of
Thomas S. Williams Jr., who was recently
indicted with Benjamin Lucey, A. L. Cas
avau, F. H. Qualman, George B. Conant,
Â£. F. Kendall and T. H. McCarthy on *
charge of distributing and publishing a
libelous circular concerning Judge Heb
bard during the recent political campaign.
It was agreed that all the cases should de
pend on the decision of the Williams case,
and the defendants must therefore stand
trial on the indictments for criminal libel
presented by the Grand Jury. Mr. Kahn
is assisting the prosecution in these cases.
The decision of Jud>-e Daingerfield is re
garded as one of the most important and
far-reachine that has ever been rendered
in cases of this sort in California. Judge
Daingerneld said:
The main ground of demurrer is that the
indictment does not state :acts sufficient to
constitute a public offense. The indictment
alleges, among other things, that the ptose
cutlng witness was a Judge and a candidate
for re-election as such; that the defendant
maliciously accused him of being an unfair
and therefore unfit person for the position of
Jndge, and tbat the attendant then and there
well knew that the alleged defamatory matter
contained in a circular to voter!*, signed by the
defendant and others, and pleaded by copy in
tbe indictment, was false. The charge that
tho prosecuting wltuess was an unfair person
is one of the averments of the circular.
This is all equivalent to accusing tbe de
fendant of knowing that the prosecuting wit
ness was a lafr person, and at the same time
maliciously charging him with being an un
fair person. In his capacity as Judge and can
didate. For the purposes of thi9 demurrer we
must assume the indictment to be true, what
ever the facts may be. The words of the cir
cular have a clear tendency to injure the
prosecut ing witness iv his office or calling of
Judge, for fairness is of the essence of the
judicial lemperament and character. Falsely
ami knowingly to impute incompetence to a
Judge Is libelous. [Odgers ou Libel end Slan
der, U8; 08.]
It Â»itiiii that whatever would be deemed de
famatory in a civil action for libel will be so
hela tna criminal action. [Odgers, supra;
575-BM.]
Newell in his work on "Defamation, Slander
and Libel," 939, says without citing authori
ties, tha"t "The U'st whether words civilly
libelous are criminally iibelous seems to be
that -. he never a party must plead special
damages in order to recover in a civil action,
no indictment can be sustained, because a suit
: for damages offers an adequate remedy."
This criterion does not seem to be sound,
for, as OJgers remarks, supra, 390, "Tnnt
there should be a criminal remedy as well as a
i civil remedy is clearly necessary, for most
libclers urc penniless, and a civil action has
no terrors for them. The plaintiff will never
get his damages. In fact, as it appears from a
recent case, ihe proprietor of many a low news
paper rather rejoices at the prospect of a civil
action (or libel'being brought against him. He
regards it as a gratuitous advertisement lor
his paper, calculated to increase its circulation
In tnese degenerate days."
Furthermore, the textbooks say that the ori
gin of the criminal proceedings was the neces
sity of preventing breacnes uf the peace by
leg'uliy avenging provocations lor %uch a
breach.
To say or write of a man anything likely to
arouse his ire is generally slanderous or libel
ous if it affects his reputatiou,and if it is un
privileged.
Jndge Dainperfield quoted further from
; Odgers to the effect that not only the in
! jured party, but the community also is
i interested in seeing that those libelers
who can pay damages shall not on that
account escape all liability of iniprison-
I ment from the fact that the libel, however
! wanton, has caused special damages only.
The court added that it is well settled
that, except in certain cases of absolute
privilege not necessary to discuss, a privi
leged communication loses its privilege
when it Is intentionally false.
Another allegation in thÂ» circular was to
the effect that Judge Hecbard appointed
to a responsible position "his bosom
I friend," a certain person mentioned as*
I "notorious," and a "political parasite."
I The court holds tbat to say of a man tbat
he has a "notorious" person for a bosom
friend is to injure the man in the estima
| tion of all people who have not that kind
! of bosom friends.
I ' In view of the facts and the law a? ap-
I plied by the court the demurrer was over-
I ruled, and tbe trial of the case was set for
! the 13. h inst.
BEVIES OF SONGSTERS,
Singing Birds From Abroad
Liberated in Mill
Valley.
A Premium to Be Off*red for the
Scalps rf the Blue
J ys.
When the skies fall larKs may be caught
in Mill Valley, but it will go bard with
nny citizen who attempts to catch them
before that time. There is great rejoicing
in the valley over the arrival of larks from
Ireland and Germany. Thrushes, black
birds and finches also came lasl week in a
consignment of singing bints to Messrs.
Michulilschke and Fitzgerald. The larks
were liberated in the woods of the valley
and one songster soared In-h and sane a
note of ecstacy to the American flag, which
waved in honor of the event.
Mr. Michalitschke said i lie climate of
Mill Valley â the temperature, the woods
and mendowsâ corresponded to the places
from which the birds came, and he was
confident the songsters would multiply
and prosper in their new home, lie is
convinced that it will be necessary to ex
terminate or drive out the bluejays, as
these birds destroy nests and eggs ot other
birds. Already the small boys of the val
|py are gunmnsr for the objectionable jay.
Alter January 1 there will be a bounty of
10 cents paid for every three biuejay
scalps. This premium will be an incentive
for a shotgun raid on the jays.
The thrushes, blackbirds and finches
were placed in an aviary built around
and over laurels and other small trees.
'l'tif larks were liberated on tne hillside
near Mr. Coffin's residence.
To Be Sent to Portland.
Harry Barton and Edward Pierson, bunko
men who were arrested on tho steamer State
of California about two weeKs ago, will be sent
back to Portland to stand their trial on a
charge of robbery. They are accused of rob
bing Edward and Alexander White, farmers
lrom Minnesota, while in Portland on their
way to Oregon City.
POOLROOM CRUSADE.
Six Arrests Made by the Police Ycstor-
â¢lay.
The police are keeping up tbe crusade
against tbe poolrooms, and yesterday six
"John Doe" warrants were obtained in
Judge Conlan's court.
Policemen Brown and Hines served
them upon J. A. Talbot, C. F. Turner, E.
Gosliner and lsadoro Messenger, Leidea
dorff street, and George Duncan and S. A.
Osterhaus, 24 Â£llis street. Tho charge
against Talbot and Turner is selling pools
outside the racetrack, and against the
other Jour violating the pool ordinance.
Judge Campheli released Talbot and
Turner on their own recognizance, and
the others gave $300 bonds for their ap
peaifnce.
The Divorce Record.
Mary E. Merlcle has been granted a divorce
from Joseph S. Mcrkle and accorded $25 a
month alimony.
Pauline A. Snoek was given a divorce from
N'icholaus J. Snoek for willful desertion, with
$10 a mouth r.llmony.
Judge Troutt had ordered the defendant in
the case of Lulu M. Campbell against Arthur
L. Campbell to pay $50 attorney's fees and
$15 a month alimony.
Margaret Tiehe has been accorded a divorce
from John F. Tighe on the ground of failure to
provide, aud Frances L. Kine has been di
vorced from J. F. Fine because of his willful
neglect.
HAMBURG EXPOSITION.

7Mi CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Welcome, mining men.
Gold has a right to talK.
The convention will be a big thing.
You can tell the McKinley man in these
days by his new hat
Make your home a market for California
industries and you will profit by it.
The sense of returning prosperity bring?
a smile even to the face of the Bryanite.
What the miners will say in convention
will be listened to by capitalists all round
the world.
The world wants cold more than ever
before, and California is certainly the best
place to look for it
Being mentioned for a place in the Cab
inet may be pretty good tÃffy, but it falls
a long way short of the pudding.
The mining industry built up the State,
and the whole Suite shou d now help in
building up tbe mining industry.
Confidence brings business and business
bepets confidence, and all things are work
inz together for the general good.
Every morning brings news of reviving
industry and every mill that starts up
owens up uew opportunities to labor.
With the return of employment for in
dustrious men the demagogues will lose
their old job and bave to hunt for belter
work.
Mr. McKinley never knew before how
many friends he had nor how many are
wi ling to help him bear the burdens oi
iffice.
We may count much on the coming of
outside capital toCal.fornia, but the sures'
way to prosperity is to count on our own
energies.
Among the American industries to be
promoted by Reiublican legMation hy
dratii'iC mining should take a front rank
and be attended to e:irly.
The free silveritea ore now talking o
getting rid of Aitgeld, Tillman and Debs,
so that they will not nave to make another
fight with such hoodoos in the van.
There seems to be a general illumination
all round in Umjm days, and the probabil
ity is t at the iont-desirei lighting of the
park at night will soon be accomplished.
The election of McKinlpy has roused the
hopes of European bimetailists, and the
outlook for an international ugreemeti t
for the free coinage of silver is decidedly
encouraeiug.
The silver Republicans in the Senate
can surely be counted on to support a pro
tective tariff. They are not likely to vote
against their principles to gratify a Dem
ocrat:c spite.
The fe'iows who predicted the election
of McKinley would be followed by dis
aster were so completely snowed under
that there is not a specimen of them in
sight anywnere.
The Democrats declare they were beaten
because of coercion, and the Populists
attribute the defeat to the fact that Bryan
ran as a Democrat and the people would
not trust him under that name.
With the Anier.can people united for
protection and European nations ready to
arrange for international bimetallism, it
Jooks as if the McKinley administration
would bave plain sailing before it.
Before many years are over competing
railroads w*ill have brought the Southern
Pacific to the level of any other business
enterprise, and there will be no more
monopoly to complain of or kick at.
There is haraly a Republican statesman
in the Nation who bus not received the
compliment of a mention for a place in the
Cabinet, and even some sound-money
Democrats are being tickled in the same
way.
The rain has come in time to rejoice tie
farmer, as the victory for protection re
joices the manuiacturer, and the pros
pects are that our farms and factories will
make a rich market for one another next
year.
As the Bryanites continue to issue their
proclamations of war, ii is clear they were
so completely knocked out by the concus
sion on election day they do not know
what bit them nor on which side of the
r6pes they are.
The songs that Yvette Gnilbert sang
with such success in New York, Boston
and Chicago have been interdicted by the
Paris police, and it is clear t ey must
be more Puritanical over there or else
they understand French belter.
It is probable tbat one of the first sec
tions of the State to profit by the new
activity will be the region aronnd Hum
bold: Bay. That country lias long needed
railway communication with the metrop
olis and will almost certainly get it now.
Koef gardens for the rich have proven
bo successful in New York the city gov
ernment has decided to build similar gar
dens over the docks along the water front
for the benefit of the poor, and while the
coonies* of our summer climate renders
such gardens unnecessary here it might
be worth while for our City government
lo watch the New York experiment and
see if some parts of it at least could not be
imitated with advantage in any future
dock- building along the bay.
CALIFORNIA MINERS.
The members of the California Miners'
Association, who meet in convention to
day, will find a cordial welcome to San
Francisco. The people of this City are
aware how much this State owes to the
mining industry, and how closely the
welfare of mining aifects the welfare of
the City and of the State at large. In ad
dition to this fact, which would lead them
to welcome the miners from a selhNh in
terest, there is tbe further sentiment of
admiration for mining men which is in
herent in California that would incline
them to give a hearty support to the
miners, even if their industry were less
great than it is and even if the interests
of the State were less concerned in ft.
The convention which assembles to-day
will probably be the mo3t notable gather
ing of raining men that has been seen for
many a year. Tbe former meetings of the
association have been held under adverse
conditions and with but gloomy prospects
before them. This time the assembly
finds itself surrounded by all the influ
ences of a dawning era of prosperity and
looks forward to prospects as bright as
any which shine along tbe future of tbe
American people. The miners will feei
the stimulus of tbe environment and
there can be little doubt that their actions
will be made more resolute and more far
reaching by ti.e confidence that after long
years 01 depression prosperity for them as
well as for their neighbors is at hand.
All things considered, the mining in
dustries of the State have a Better outlook
than any other industry. The victory at
the polls was a victory for cold as well as
for protection. The demand for gold will
certainly not fall off as a result of McKin
ley's victory. O:i the contrary, the ex
pnntion of trade and the revival cf indus
try on the gold basis will tend to increase
the demand for tbat metal and aid to the
profits of those that mine it. This will
turn the attention of capitalists in tbe
great centers of wealth to gold-mining
countries with a renewed interest aim
among those countries the gold-bearing
districts of California most certainly will
not be overlooked.
It cannot be questioned that provisions
might be made for carrying on hydraulic
mining without injury to the valleys and
the rivers. Modern engineering is cer
ainly equal to such a task without e*
l ending more money and time than
would be profitable. Our mountains are
still rich with golden ore, and since it
would benefit the whole Union to have
the gold taken from them and put into
the channels o: trade, it is no more than
fair that the whole people through the
General Government should assist in de
.mying the cost.
However these things may be, the
miners will find a warm and hearty recep
tion in San Francisco. Taey come to us
as representatives of that great industry
which made tbe State famous and laid
the foundation of its pre;.e;it prosperity.
The California miner has Ion? been the
typical citzen of the State. Even to this
Jay the East regards us as a mining State
more than anything else. Our own peo
ple to a large ei:ent share this senti
ment. The miner is welcome in every
nome, and tlie sympathies of ail the reople
are with him in his labors and in his
hopes.
THE WAIL OF THE VANQUISHED.
Following the example of Bryan the
lesser leaaers of ihe late ;uÂ«ion have
;-sued proclamations to their supporters
exhorting them to have courage and ex
plaining to iheru the sad acciden s which
1:1 their judgment led to the overwhelming
defeat at tbe polls.
A. J. Warner, pres-dent of the Bi
metallic Union, give- such cheer as he
can in these word-: "The victory of gold
was a v ctory of trusts and syndicated
wealth oroughl about by corruption and
coercion and not a victory by the people
for the people, and it cannot last." He
claims further tbat the policy of the suc
cessful 1 arty will subject the United State 3
absolutely to British domination and sees
a proof of this in the fact that the British
press rejoices in the election of McKinley.
To despairing and demoralized Democ
racy ihat address mi.-ht have brought
some comfort had not Chairman Butler of
t c Popuiist National Committee taken it
into his head to issue an address to his
followers on the selfsame day. Senator
Butler is as sanguine as Mr. Warner tbat
victory will yet be gained by the fusion
party, but he does not attribute tbe recent
defeat to tbe same causes. In his address
there is nothing about coercion. He sees
a sufficient cause for the overthrow ol
Bryan in another quarter altogether.
Chairman Butler say : "Had it not been
for the prejudice against the Democratic
name as w 11 as a want of confidence in
Democratic promises, for which it must
be admitted past experience furnishes
ample ground, the majority of the voters
of the country would have cast their votes
ior reform."
It is very clear that Senator Butler ex
pects the next campaign to be conducted
by those whom he is pleased to call "re
formers" under the Populist standard and
with the Popuiist name, as well as on tbe
Populist platform. Democrats, therefore,
who propose to follow Bryan next time
must give up their name as well as their
principles and shout the mighty names of
Jefferson and Jackson no more.
The quarrel is none of ours and we are
able to consider it impartially. Under
such consideration it is clear that Senator
Butler is more nearly right than Mr. War
ner. There was no corruption nor coer
cion at tbe polls, but there was a whole
some and widespread distrust of Democ
racy. Whether tbat distrust can be re
moved from the public mind by a change
01 name remains, to be seen. When last
heard from States like Colorado, Kansas
and South Carolina, where Populism has
been tried, were of opinion that the new
party was a shade worse than the old.
PROSPERITY FOR HUMBOLDT.
One of tbe couuties of the State likely
to receive ".n early benefit from the revi
val of prosperity is Huinboidt. The rich
region within the county and immediately
surrounding it has never had those facili
ties of transportation which are necessary
for the development of its resources and
the progressive welfare of its people.
These facilities are now almost sure to be
attained and the capitalists of San Fran
cisco should take, the leaa in providing
tnem.
Few portions of the world are so rich in
natural resources as is Humboldt County.
It opens to the ocean a spacious bay,
is rich in fertile soil fit for almost any
kind of rural industry from hay raising
to fruit growing, and possesses immense
wealth in the great forests that now coy r
almost the whole territory. With proper
facilities for the export of goods through
railway connection with the rest of the
State, the advance in Humboldt would
not fail to be remarkable in every respect.
We have had booms in Southern Cali
fornia and around Puget Soun 1 and as a
consequence those sections of tbe country
have been fairly well developed, but the
vast region lying between this City and
Oregon has remained almost unnoticed
by capital, and to a large extent over
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1896.
looked by enterprise. Tbe men who bave
settled in tbat region have been energetic,
industrious and progressive, but they have
lacked tbe means of overcoming the ob
stacles in the way of great railroad build
ing, and their rich county remains to this
day almost shut off from the resX of the
world.
For some years past projects for railway
building through Hirraboldt and the re
gion around it have been discussed and
ways and means for carrying them out de
vised. If it had not been for the panic of
1893 and the long depression which fol
lowed it is safe to say that one of these
projects would have been realized before
this. The awakening of industry which
has so promptly followed the election of
McKinley will, of course, revive these
plans for the opening up of tbe rich north
and the development of Humboldt. Be
fore the coming Winter is over some plans
may be arranged for the immediate be
ginning of the work, and in a compara
tively short time this long secluded region
may be a- open to enterprise and develop
ment as is the country around Los Ange
les and Puget Sound.
INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM.
According to all reports from Europe the
chances for obtaining an international
agreement for the free coinage of silver
are decidedly pood. The election of Mc-
Kinley has awakened a new confidence in
the bimetallists of all European countries,
and as a result a strong sentiment is being
worked up in favor of co-operation among
the great powers to bring about a larger
use of silver in the settlement of inter
national commerce.
Genuine bimetallists never favored the
election of Mr. Bryan, because they knew
that his success would put an end to all
hope of international bimetallism. The
free coinage of silver by 1 his country alone
would have Jed to the export of gold to
Europe, and in consequence those nations
would have had all the gold they required
for theii uses and there would have been
no reason why they should show any favor
to silver. In the United States on the
other hand, we having nothing but silver
would have been in no position to make
terms with the gold-using nations.
The first efforts of thÂ« McKinley ad
ministration will naturally be a revision
of the tariff in accordance with the princi
ples of protection. We must provide an
adequate revenue for the Government and
make tbe American market secure to the
American producer, so as to provide
abundant employment at good wages for
American labor before anything else.
That work, however, will hardly require
much time. The House will be over
whelmingly in favor of protection, and
there is an assurance that the neit Senate
will also have a working majority in favor
<>f the same principle. This will make
tariff revision a comparatively easy task,
and tbe energies of the admistration can
be directed toward carrying out : he pledge
of the party platform to promote the
much-desired international agreement for
the free coinage of silver.
Maj >r McKinley is known to be a genu
ine bimetallism The monetary piank In
the platform was in us essence an epitome
of his sentiments as expressed by his
speeches and his actions wlnle a member
oi Congress. He wil' therefore be as Presi
dent in complete sympathy with the plat
form. The work of bringing about an in
ternational agreement in accordance with
the party pledge will not be with him a
mere perfunctory observance. He can be
counted on to enter upon tbat task with
all the ardor, energy and sagacity of his
nature, and he will have the hearty sup
port of a great majority o Republicans in
both houses of Congress and throughout
the country.
It would seem, moreover, that since thf
b metallic movement has revived in
Europe the President may have com
paratively plain sailing before him in tbe
accomplishment of international agree
ment. There will, of course, be obstacles
in the way. There are many gold stand
ard men in this country who Will combat
his efforts by every means in their power,
an i there is a s ronr conservuti m in
Europe which the Governments of those
countries will hesitate to antagonize.
Nevertheless the outlook is clear'y prom
ising. Nevr has the chance of bringing
about international bimetal. i>m been so
eood and never has there bet-n h Fre i
dent of the United States batter fitted both
by training and sentiment and better sup
ported both by Congrers and by the
people to undertake the task of leading
the nations in the way of restoring silver
to its full use a< a monetary metal.
REVIVING INDUSTRY.
According to dispatches from New York
nearly 200,000 *lpÂ«n hitherto unemployed
hare already been set to work as a result
of the election of McKinley and the tri
umph of protection :ind sound monoy.
Reports of opening mills and expanding
enterprises come from every section of the
Union, and a thous.md evidences attest
that the long depression has ended at last,
and a new era of prosperity begun.
From Cincinnati it ia reported that four
great industrial establishments which
have been working with reduced forces
for a long time have already increao^d
the number of iljeir men and are now run
ning to the full limit. In Cleveland two
great machine companies have begun this
week by employing 150 aid.tional men.
In Chattanooga orders have been received
by the rolling-mills which have led to em
ployment of upward of 200 men during the
week.
Kansas City reports the establishment
of a manufactory which begins work with
100 men from the start Elizabeth, N. J..
announces that the National Cordage
Company, whose plant was burned some
lime ago, has decided to rebuild it and
will give employment to 2000 men. From
Denver comes the news :hat the iron
companies and mills have started work
on the construction of steel rails, and will
at once engage about 1500 men. Victor,
Colo., reports the beginning of a new elec
tric line, thirty-one miles in length, which
of course will afford work to many. To
ledo reports the reopening of a rolling
mill and the employment of 200 men.
From Terre Haute the news comes that
the rolling-mills began yesterday to em
ploy 400 additional men, and that the
Standard Wheel Company would rlso add
to their force. Texarkana announces that
the Central Coal and Coke Company has
issued orders to start up all the mills De
cember I, and that several hundred men
have been put to work on the Kansas City
and Gulf Railroad. From Utica, N. V.,
comes the further news that the West
Shore Railroad shops at Frankfort have
started up running on full time and will
give employment to 800 men.
These instances by no means-adequately
represent the full extent of the revival of
industry. Taken as they are, however,
from all sections of the country, the east
and west, north and south, they serve to
show how widespread is the feeling of
confidence in the coming of better times.
Capital has now an assurance of profit,
and as a consequence it can once more give
employment to the workiugmen of the
country. Labor's opportunity has come
at last. The job will soon be hunting the
m*n instead of the man hunting the job.
INDECENT JOURNALISM.
We believe, and make the statement after
long and earnest effort of the memory, that
the Sew York Journal is positively the worst
newspaper we can recall. Under the mask of
procuring the news It has inaugurated the
practice of filling the columns of its daily
issue with the cheapest, shallowest sensation,
while its Sunday Issue is even of a lower order
than the Police Gazette or Standard. lis arti
cles are a mere cloak for all that is morbid
and unhealthy, Its illustrations (done with a
certain French chic and cleverness that makes
them all the more dangerous) are & mere ex
cuse for indecency.
As examples of the former run over the
scare heads of articles taken at random from
one of the Journal's lecent Sunday issues:
"For uore"; "Shocked by Girls Who Wear
Tights and Dance for Charity" ;"Camille D'Ar
ville Refuses to Appear as Mother Eve";
"Known in Many Clubs, Now. In a Cell";
"James Waterbury, Millionaire and MostFash
lonabla Man in New York, Now a Poor Clerk
in a R6pe Walk"; "Alan Dale on Actors Who
Travel on Their Shape"; 4< A Society Girl in
Trousers" ; "Razor Strops of Human Skin." All
these with appropriate illustrationsâ Dixey's
legs, KeTeey's trousers, etc Hardly any com
ment is necessary. The public asking for
truth and news is answered by a sketch of
Mr. Dixey's legs and pictures of undressed and
half-dressed women. One of ihe ' 'features" of
the Journal, which the editor has advertised
with a sound of trumpets, is Stephen Crane's
'The Tenderloin as It Is." It is immaterial
who wrote the article, Stephen Crane's name
notwithstanding, It Is the veriest filth. We
have yet to see even the Police Gazette de
scend to such depths.
The article on Mr. Waterbury can move the
intelligent reader only to a sense of Indigna
tion against the cowardly and hypocritical
attack upon the gentleman of whom it treats.
It is striking a man when he is down, it is
making capital out of his misfortunes, under
the contemptible guise of praising "American
grit," and this unspeakable sheet with its
morbid sensations its gross exaggerations, its
absurd and palpable lies, its rauk obscenity, is
sown broadcast in the streets of New York,
finding its way Into the sctool and the home
to be read by young boys and little girls. Iv
hypocrisy is, perhaps, its worst crime, for the
New York Journal is not frankly, honestly in
decent, as are the French papers it attempts to
imitate, but cloaks its nastiness under the
semblance of worth and enterprise.
Small wonder that Lie has begun its
vigorous campaign against the "Mission of the
Daily." The good wishes of every honest
journalist ik with thatadmlrable little weekly,
it is precisely such dirt as is found In the
Journal that has brought the American press
into such 111 odor.
The Western protoype of the New York
Journal Is the San Francisco Examiner, owned
by the same man and conducted on the same
lines. The following communication, which
we have received from a well-known attorney
of this City who participated in the Republi
can parade of last Saturday, is self-explanatlve:
Editor of The Wave : I have been a subscriber to
(he San .Krnnclsco Kxaiuiaer for several years I
have stopped tbat paper forever, and numerous
friends htve pursued the same course In conse
quence or the Kx.irciner's attltuae during this
campaign. I have not seen this fact mentioned in
the dally papers, hence write you concerning it.
Ipon tbe day of tbe Republican purade (laat Satur
day) there stood in front of the Examiner's office
what appealed to oe a party of hired hoodlums, all
wearing Bryan baUves and holding up largp sliver
o lars similar to those with which the Kxaminer
office was decora'.ed. I hese hir?<t ruffians mÂ» ie it
. i.elr business to rive vo.ee to hoots and derisive
-housa: theproc ssi >n as it passed, aud to hiss and
insult the purticipa ts la tbe parade. They used
every means within the power of such a niongrei
I. rood to disturb the procession aud its partici
pants. I witnessed this proceeding with a good
deal of indignation and read subsequently the
Kxamlner's account of the pÂ»ra:e and the nay It
was received aloi g :he line of march. I make free
to say thai outside of the hired men who s ood in
front of the Kxamin*r's o.iice that paper's account
â¢<f the reception at the parade along the line of
march was M lnfaniom fals-hoo i.
May I ing ilre of you how it is that the Examiner
finds It necessary to cater only to the low element
01 society, and never to decency?
The writer of this letter only expresses what
we have heard from many other -ources. The
trouble wim what bur correspondent is
.-â¢leased to call the respectable or decent ele
ment of society is that they do not readily re
sent a wrong or injustice heaped upon them
by a daily paper. It is different with the mob.
Let the Examiner contain the s.ightest refer
ence antagonistic to any of the indecent ele
ments of society, and at once tbe business
office is alarmed by a number of orders to stop
the Examiner. This b eeds a wholesome fear
of this c. ass of subscriber. What is known ns
the respectab.e ek-ment of society seldom re
torts to this method of showing Its d sappro
batlon, and as that end of so> iety dees not in
terfere with the business office or create any
alarm iht rein it is not co-.ssidered as being of
enough consequence to please. It is apparent
the Examiner has suffered a number of

DOWNFALL OF DEM GOGUES
This should not be a season for "crowing"
over the mi.-guided men who were misted iuio
following Bryan with hoi:esi zeal aud fervor,
but it is a season for "crowing" over the Tlll
mans, the Budas, the Examiners, the Alt
ge ds and the sinister torces that were moved
by disloyalty, governed by hatred and actu
ated by mean instincts and ignoble purpose.
No explanation, no sophistries nor arguments
can palliate or excuse the intemperate utter
ances of our miserable chief magistrate, who
shocked decency and violated honor by the
incendiary, miserable and outrageous utter
ances to which he gave voice upjn the stump.
He seemed to forget that be was Governor,
and remembered oniy tbat he was Budd. No
pea of pary fervor can excuse the style and
character of the campaign conducted by the
Examiner. Jt was mean, devilish and de
praved. It lied openly and deliberately. It
distorted the truth out of all semblance of
facts and piled abuse upon the head* of honest
men, whose sole offending consisted of iheir
Republicanism. It attempted to breed a spirit
of hatred in the mind of .abor against Its em
ployers. It appealed to every prejudice and
ciass hatred, and would have stopped at noth
ing, no matterhow disreputable, that promised
to secure a vote for the infamous cause which
it attempted to sustain.
The hurt that comes to a good American
citizen, the thing that wounds, is the thought
that a great National party could deem it ex
peuient to adopt such a platiorm as that sanc
tioned by Democracy and the further thought
that Bryan was even a serious possiblliiy.
There's where the hurt lies, that he was even a
possibility.â The Wave.

Letters From the People.
THE OUTLOOK.
What It to Be the future of the Opposi-
tion Forces.
To the Editor of the San Francisco CalL- Sir:
No man cau be a genuine Populist who Is not
somewhat of a philosopher. He has read his
tory. It teaches him patience. He soon learns
that the race makes progress slowly. In the
science of government this is most notably
true. All nations teach this lesson. Our own
country is not an exception. Politics would
seem to be a game of blind-man's-buff. Voters
rush from one side to the other trying to catch
the right man who can give them what his
party promises. For Illustration go back
twenty years.
At the close of Grant's administration the
popular vote elected Tilden by more than a
quarter of a million votes. Four years later
Garfleld was elected by only 7018 votes. Four
years later, In 1884, Cleveland was elected by
more than 62,000 votes, defeating Biaine, the
idol of his party. But In four years the people
rejected Cleveland by more than 98,000 votes
and went back to the Republican party under
Harrison. Four years later, in 1892, they gave
Cleveland 332,95t> more votes than Harrison
and went back to the Democracy; and now, in
1896, they go back to the Republican party,
electing McKinley by about a million votes
more than they gave the Democratic candidate.
Thus the people go *if?zag :rom one party to
the other playing their foolish game of blind
man's-buff and call it politic?.
Thus it appears on the surface; but what Is
beneath it? Is there no real progress? To the
superficial mind the people may indeed seem
to be ail blinded and merely playing at blind
man's-buff. But Populists look beneath the
surface Four years ago, when the people re
jected Harrison and tne McKin icy tariff and
blindly turned to Cleveland and Democracy
for relief, the People's party offered them a
radical change in the policy of the Govern
ment.but only 1,122.045 voters out of 12,154,
-537 accepted it. Bui so great was the change
wrought by the cnfÂ»ilnui<uÃ â¢ fforts of the Peo
ple's party from 1892 to 1896 that the old his
toric Democratic party, which polled 5,556,
-333 votes for Cleveland, and rejected the offer
01 tne People's party by that number of votes,
actually took ud the radical policy of the Peo
ple's party and went before the country on
these new issues and were joined by the Popu
lists and a large number of free-silver R pub
licans, polling nearly oni-half of the entire
vote of me country, in a large portion of It
carrying great States by large majorities in
favor of this radical change in government
policy.
Wnatever may be said or thought with re
gard to the People's party there can be but
one conclusion as to iis influence on tbe polit
ical history of this countryâ it ha* already se
cured the adoption of an important part of its
principles by nearly half of tbe voters and it
has come to stay as a political factor in Ameri
can politics under such name and organization
as ihe future may unfold. Its most strenuous
opponents will concede the fact that no ooliti
cai party in the country has grown to such
formidable proportions in so short a time, ana
nis wish is father to his thought who lor a
moment thinks that the po. icy for which tbe
People's party stands has me t astaggering blow
in the recent election. A political revolution 1
has been inaugurated with such Impressive
earnestness that it has almost triumphed at '
the no. is, and lie is ill instructed in the his
tory of nations who does not know that revo
lutions of this nature never go backward.
There is but one thing tbat can check the
progress of the policy inaugurated by tiie Peo- I
pie's party, and that Is the success of trie Re
publican party in restoring prosperity to the
country under McKinley's administration. A
majority of the people have accepted the
promises made by the orators and uewspapers
of the Republican party and have returned
the party to power under Buch favorable con
ditions that it can probably do nil that has
been promised; but if ihe people whose votes
have placed it in power shah meet with disap
pointment it will be a sorry day for the coun
try and the Republicau party. As a Populist
I desire to go on record here in favor of giving
the new administration the iuiiest possible
opportu iiy to carry out Its po.icy unob
structed by a sli gle Populist or Democratic
vote in either branch of Congress, that it may 1
have no excuse for a failure to redeem its
promises to the country.
At the same time I am free to confess that I I
do not be.ieve it p ss.ble, looking over the Bit- ]
uation of the country from a Popu.ist point of |
view, for the Republican party to meet Its en- I
gagements with the people who have placed it j
in power, for the simple reason that its poncy !
wil not permit it to adopt such measures ks I
will secure the prosperity it has promised. It j
la not necessary to charge bad faith to the i
leaders ol the party, and I do not, but its pol- i
icy wih render its efforts futile to accomplish i
the task It has undertaken to penorm. In
deed, I look for a comp.ete revolution in pub
lic sentiment within two years, and the elec
tion of a 1 ongress which will demand the
enforcement 01 the policy announced and
defended by the reform forces which met wrh
temporary defeat under the gallant leadership
oi Brvanin the political contest just eh.sed.
At this time it Is not necessary, and might
seem inappropriate, to enter upon a statement
of the rea-ons which Influence my judgment
in reaching this cot. clue inn.

THE CUBAN SITUATION.
Spanish Atrccltm* in Cuba Render Amer
...â ' icon Interference Sreetaart/.
November 6, 1896.
Editor of the Call, San Francisco, Cal.â Deab
Sir: Iv a letterfrom a Cuban friend, one of the
most distinguished scholars of that island, is
expressed a sentiment from which there Is no
doubt as to which side, in the present war in
Cuba, the cultivated and intelligent classes
are on.
The following is a translation from his letter,
which may be of Interest to your readers : "I do
hope that it wiil not be long before a stop is
put to so much bloodshed, to so many iniqui
ties committed daily by the Spaniards. The
civilized world knows that the Cubans kill no
prisoner, thai they care for the wounded and
protect the peaceful. The struggle will go on
between the representatives of the sixteenth
century and us who live at the ena of the
nineteenth. If neea be, everything will re
main sicut tabu lam rasnm (sic) until the Na
tion of Washington and Lincoln stretch out to
us her powerful and dreaded hand, putting an
end to so many murders, so many norrors aid
ing us to fulfill.on onr side, the-saving precept
America ior the Americans." Very truly
yours. Davtd 8. Jordan.
RESENTS AGAIN VEXED,

Against the Use of
Folsom Granite.
Berkeley's Institu ioa Is Gladdened
by the G nerosity of Mrs.
Hearst.
The regents of the university are hnvine
no and of trouble with the affiliated col
le es build. ng. The contracts were all
duly awarded and signed. The Governor
himself ogreed that Foisom granke oould
be used and Mayor Sutro, in his gener
os.ty, gave the land and two extensions of
time for beginning work. When all the
differences were seemingly adjusted on
lines that indicated mmediate and active
work the Attorney-General alarmed all
the interested parties by a ruling that
*olsom Rranite could not be used.
To-day the regents will meet to consider
the new complication. It is possible that
Judge Wallace, Arthur Rndgers and
Major Mhoon may devise some plan of
action to save the site and prevent the
State appropriation from reverting back
to the treasury. The expression of opin
ion among regents yesterday was to the
effect that operations would not be sus
pended by reason of the Attorney-Gen
eral's rulings. J
Regent J. B. Reiostein and Architect
May beck expected to start for the East
yesterday evening, but the new complica
tion requires the regent's presence in the
City for a few days. Mr. Reinstein will
not extend hxs Journey beyond the conti
nent, but Mr. Miybeck will go abroad and
confer with architect* of world-wide fame.
Mrs. Hearst s gen rous letter requesting
the pr vilege of meeting the cost of the
international competition of architects
for the new plan of extending the uni
versity buildinan at Berkeley places the
regents on velvat in this enterprise. She
hag plainly indicated that the competition
shall not be hindered for lack of , money.
In a word the regents are told to go ahead
and 'obtain by competition â by tue offer
of liberal â  prizes to the. great- st architects
of. the worldâ the plans for century of i
university ex'e.nsion. . She Las also sjg^l

CANDIDATES' EXPENSES.
Statements Filed W thi the County
C.erk Indicate Exce.-d ugly
Cheap Campaigns.
Candidates for office at the late election
bave begun to file their statements of ex
penses incurred during the campaign. It
is known that th^ rains tbat occurred just
prior to eleciion day caused considerable
additional outlay on the part of many of
the nominees because their cards and ban
ners were disfigured by the wet, yet
among the statements thus far submitted
to County Clerk Curry no mention of that
fact has been made. Inasmuch as the
damage done by the rain may be clashed
as an act of Providence, candidates prob
ably feel that th^y are justified in deduct
ing that extra expense from the total paid
I out.
Samnel Braunhart, who was elected
State Senat r for the Seventeenth Senato
rial District, makes affidavit that no one
else contributed to his campaign fund and
that he expenued only $116 50 in securing
his election.
Fleet F. Strother, who had an ambition
to be Auditor, consesses to putting out
$395 50, of which $200 went to the Demo
cratic party and $120 to the People's party.
Henry Huppert, who aspired to rep
resent the First Ward in the Board of
Supervisors, evidently did not value that
honor above Us worth, for he places hU
expenses at $100 50.
Attorney J. A. Spinetti looked with
gome desire on a seat with the Police
Judges of the City, and in c rder to ad
vance his chances paid out $320, appor
tioned as follows: Democratic Committee,
?200; People's party, $80; J. H. Barry for
printing, $40. The vouchers, Mr. Spinetti^
says, are lost.
It is a notable fact that none of the can
didates, whether defeated or successful,
have confessed to purchasing so much as
one glass of beer, einger pop or soda
water in order to help themselves into
office. This is remarkable, considering
the amount of potables that coul 1 be ob
tained free of cost by voters just prior to
the 3d inst. It is possible that those who
purchased and distributed the aforesaid
drinkables are among the number yet to
lile their statements of expenditures.

WILL ASK FOR
GREATER POWER
Important Anti â¢ Railroad
Legislation in
Prospect.
Commissioner La Rue Will Make
Several New and Interest
ing Suggestions.
1
LESSONS OF THE REC-HT SUIT.
Attention Called to the Long Delay
in Rendering a Decision by
the Court.
At the office of the Railroad ConiroiÃ
sion work is being pushed with the utmost
expedition on one of tnt. most interesting
and important reports ever (submitted by
that body to the Governor of the State.
The experience of the past year has been
prolific in the development of new phases
of the railroad question and the powers of
the commission, and these points will be
male the subject of extended considera
tion in the forthcoming communication to
the chief executive.
Particular attention will be paid to the
legal complications that have grown out
of the case of the Southern Pacific Com
pany vs. the Kailroad Commission, asking
fora restraining order against the com
mission in the matter of rate reductions.
Chairman La Rue has some strong, per
tinent and novel views in this connection,
and they will be embodied in the annual
report of the commission. After review
ing the manner in which the bands ot the
commission have been lied for more than
a year by the litigation instituted by the
Southern Pacific Company, Commissioner
L a Rue will suggest that further legisla
tion be enacted to strengthen the position
of the commission, and he will call atten
tion to some of the most important acts
that are desirable.
He will point out that the case now
awaiting Judge McKenna's decision came
up for hearing on October 22, 1895â more
tlian a year ago; that is was postponed
from time to time until the 10th of Decem
ber, 3895, before the actnal trial be^an,
and that the case was submitted for
decision as long a*o as May 20, 1896. The
report will then read as follows:
Months have elapsed since the case was sub
muted. The question as to granting the In
junction as prayed for remains yet undeter
mined and undecided. Under the temporary
restraining order our hands are tied and we
are powerless to act In any manner relating to
the correction of discriminations or the fixing
of raies ot freights and fare* where the
Southern Pacific Company is a party.
In this case of the Southern Pacific Company
the jurisdiction of the commission is ques
tioned, iv constitutionality attacked, ana its
power to make and regulate rates of freights
and fares, correct abuses and discriminations
denied.
Notdesiring to involve the State in further
litigation wherein the same questions would
Brise, we have refrained from attempting to
regulate or change the rales of either freights
or lares upon any of the other railroads oper
ated witnin the State, believing it better for j
all parties interested to wail until the queâ ]
tions now pending in the Circuit Conn oi tne
United Stai> b are decided.
The questions involved in the case now
pending are of very great importance to the
people of th!s State, and hb a matter of right
and justice to them the case ought to be de
cided at as early a day as ca-. be consistently
done that one may know whether the com
mission hÂ«g any power and ig to be of my use;
wheiher legislation is required to enable the
commission to carry out the intention of the
constitution and of the will oi the people as
expressed by them by the adoption of said
constitution, or wheiher we are merely a
commission in name only without the power
to accomplish any good whatever.
After reciting and (ommentine upon the
two statutes already passed by t c Leg B
lature relative to the Railroad Commis
sion, the report will continue as follows:
But little if any more power is conferred by
these statutes upon the commission than is di
rectly provided by the constitution.
We are ot the opinion thai to make the work
of the commission effective and to enable it
to carry out the provisions of the constitution
In such manner as its framers Intended, and
as the wanu of the people reqiire and de
mand, further powers should be conferred by
the enactment oi Buch .aw* as would give the
commission power and make it their duty to
compel all transportation companies lo report
annualiy to said commission, or oftener if
necessary, giving a statement in detail of
their organization and affairs Jn conformity
with such rules ivnd regulations as sn*.l be
adopted by said commission; al.-o the right to
regulnte the 6peed of trains at rnilway cross
li g*: to compel the erection of bells at same;
the location of station depo.g. switches, side
tracks, turnouts and spurs for the benefit and
convenience of shippers; to investigate acci
dents and ton quire the posting of schedules
of freights and tares in depot*.
The suggestion to give the commission
power to regulate the location of switches,
sidetra* k-, etc., is based on some peculiar
and sign.ticant reports that have reached
the ears of the Commissioners. One of
these is that some time ago a company
bought a large tract of timber land in one
of the northern counties of California, and
after a large quantity Â«f lumber had been
cut irom it and was ready for shipment
the Southern Pacific Company took up
its sidetrack from the station near the
tract and the lumber people were left ab
solutely without means of transportation
for their product, which was thus made
virtually worthless. In this predicament
they were approached by an individual
who succeeded in purchasing the whole
outfit â plant, lumber and tract â for a
mere song, comparatively speaking.
Shortly aferward the sidetrack of the
Southern Pacific Company was replaced
and subsequent developments showed
that the purchaser was a gentleman very
close to the high officials of the Southern
Pacinc Company.
The lastjsugseation, relative to posting
freight and fare schedules in depots ia
due to the present method of evading the
Jaw, which requires them to be accessible
to the pub.ic at all times. The schedules,
however, are not placed where the public
can see them; instead, there is a printed
notice bung up at the various stations in
forming the reader .hat he can learn the
rates by application to the agent of the
company.
It is understood that Governor Budd is
in sympathy with these views of the com
mission and will reconr mended such legis
lation as outlined in the report, and an in
teresting session of the Legislature, with
the railroad out uf politics, may be loosed
for.
R. J. HAMILTON ARRESTED.
Accused of Sending an Obscene Letter

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1896.
The Bark Canada That "Was in Collision With the Steamer City of Puebla When on Her Way Here
From Puget Sound, and That Went Ashore in the Bay Near Fort Mason, as She Appeared
When Docked at the Foot of Third Street Yesterday.
STOLE A SHIP'S
BIG FOG BELL
The Water Front Is Just
Now Infested With
Thieves.
Took the Pride of the Lancing
and Looted the British
Princess.
FOUR YOUNG BURGLARS CAUGHT
After Many Vicissitudes the Bark Can
ada Was Finally Docked at
Third-Street Wharf.
After many vicissitudes the bark Canada
was finally docked at the foot of Third
street yesterday morning. On October 24
i she was in collision with the steamer City
i of Puebla and both vessels were damaged.
When the Puebla arrived here Captain
Debney reported having been in collision,
. and the starboard side of the vessel
i showed ample evidence of the fact. There
' was a very heavy fog at the time and
â  neither vessel saw the other until they
: were close together. The Canada lost the
; fluke of her anchor, had her cathead
! carried away, and a glancing blow split
i the iibboom. The latter was "fished" and
I the bark proceeded.
When the Canada arrived off the Golden
! Gate Captain Wickberg determined to sail
' in. He had done sojhi a hundred different
! occasions and made sure be could succeed
i again. After waiting twenty-four hcurs
!he got a favorable wind and reached
I MeiggÃ wharf before the ebb tide, and the
wind dying out proved his undoing. The
only remaining anchor was dropped, but
at the critical moment it parted, and to
prevent his vessel from driiting out to sea
Captain Wickberg put her about and ran
j heron a mud bank near Black Point.
In talking about the matter Captain
Wickberg said: "When the Puebla ran us
duwn the Canada was on the storboard
tack and our foghorn was being blown
every minute. We could hear the steam
er's whistle every minute, but maybe they
did not hear ours. The wind was very
light and we Were not making more than
a mile an nour, so when the Puebla came
i down on us we were a most stationary.
! It was a glancing blow and the damage
I was not great. They are now putting a
! new anctior aboard, and when the cathead
j and tbo martingale are replaced the ves
j ael will be as good as new.
>; A big piece of the Puebla's bow mold
ing came aboard and we have it now.
Captain Debuey can have it any time he
calls for it."
The Canada will discharge her cargo of
piles and will then undergo an overhaul
ing.
The bark McNear and the barkentine
Retriever are lying side by side at How-
I ard-street wharf. The former is loading
I lumber for Australia and the later is
i supplying her with her cargo. Some of
I tiie timbers are 70 fÂ»et long and 24x24,
while otheri are 22x22 and 20x20. Tne^e
are for use in tne Coolpariie mines mid
are the fulfilling of a special order. The
timbers are hauled from the Retriever
on o the bu kh*ad and thence into the
hold of the McNear.
Wuter-front tuieves are making the
lives of the Harbor police miserable just
| now. Theft after tueft and burelary after
i burglary biive been reported until Captain
j Dunleavy is at his wit's end to find of
ficers to foilow up the tracks of the crimi
nals. Last night a gan of tnieVes got
| aooanl the British ship Lancing and ac
tually stule the big brass log-bell from the
topgallant forecastle deck. The watch
man was on duty an>l keeping a vigilant
eve n the gangway aft, but as the ship ii
I 408 feet long and he was aft, it was a com
paratively easy job for the fiieves to work
without bein/ detected. They evidently
took out the clapper and then lowered the
| bell over the side into a boat. When the
captain got up this morning all that was
left of the $150 bell was tne sockets.
While tue Lancing's bell was being
stolen anot-er gang was at work on the
ship British Princes*, lying on the other
side of the wharf. The robbers got into
the cabin and fhiding the first and second
mate asleep stole every article of value,
including all their clothing, out of the
rooms. Not even a pair of trojsers was
let, and the two men had to borrow from
their shipmates before they could again
appear on deck.
George Ross, the shipwri ht.was another
sufferer. H â¢ was at work on one of the
State's ilredgers and requiring a particular
kind of auger sent one of the men to the
tool crftest fey it. When it was brought to
him another piece of work had been
started, and the auirer wan placed in a vise
lor safe keeping. When wanted both vise
an au^er were gone. Then there was
trouble and a general search inaugurated.
A man on the wharf csked what was the
trouble and when told said: "Why, a
workingman went up the wharf with an
auger and a vise just a tew minutes Â»ko."
The police ne<e summoned, but Ro s had
to buy another auger before be could finish
hit job.
YfÃterdny Frank Moore, aeed 18, "Bert"
hughes, agÂ« | 18, "Tom" Rley, aged 18,
and "Joe" Kinc, aged 16, were ail booked
at the Harbor Police station on a < barge
of burglary. ThGy broke into the Over
land Packing Company's warehouse on
Battery street, and took everything they
could carry. Solder, lead, connection* for
the steam gear, tools, some tin plates and
whatever canned goods they wanteit.
Officer Ellis was detailed on the case by
Captain Dunleavy, and he ran the young
thieves to earth in Chinatown. They had
with them two sacks full of plunder, which
they were trying to sell. On Riley was
found a 22-CHliber pistol and on the others
picklocks and other burglars' tools. They
were charged wita burglary at the Harbor
Police station. The boys assert their in
nocence and say they found the stuff.
The British ship Arcic Stream arrived
from Sydney, N. 8. W., after a smart
passage of nfiy-six days. She left here on
May 18 last, thus making the round trip
in less than six months. From here she
took wheat to Sydney and from the latter
port brought back coal. Sue is now pre
pared to take a charter to load wheat for
Europe.
Tue wharf at the foot of Lombard street
is the most exposed on the water-front,
and in consequence it is a white elephant
on the hands of the present Board of Har
bor Commissioners, as vessels will not lie
at it. The big tramp steamer Amapoora
went in there last Sunday, but t c tide,
running like a millrace, carried away her
forward moorings, and in order to hold
her the captain had to drop bis anchor.
Thus she lay during the afternoon of yes
terday, moored aft, but ncr anchor hold
ing Her forward.
Among the arrivals last night was the
steamer Newport from Panama and way
ports. She brought up the following pas
sengers: N. G. Robertson, A. Satter and
daughter, Mr 3. J. Gonzales, G. A. Mar
shall, N. Torney. N. H. Talbot. Frank
Bromley, A. Schuma her, Miss Beasley,

Neraoto, Mrs. M. Chaples, G. C. Hatt, E.
Giniberg and wife, Oscar Hamilton, R.
Leonard and ten Chinese in transit for
Hongkong.
Another "dolt" has been getting in his
work. The following letter was picked
up in a bottle by the cap am of the life
saving station at Umpqua and forwarded
to the Merchants' Exchange:

BAD MOTHERS IN PERIL
Society for the Prevention ol
Cruelty to Children
Aroused.
Woman Who Carry Ycung Babies
Around on the Sa oon Ronte
May Go to Jail.
The Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children may succeed, with
the case of Alega Sanchez, in making a
new departure in a matter of not a little
importance to defenseless little children.
Alega Sanchez was last night discovered
taking all the steps necessary to a pro
gressive spree. She had with her two
young children. The younger, a four
month old girl, hung over or under the
woman's arm as tne case might be, while
the woman went from saloon to saloon.
The rain beat upon the child, drenching it
to the skin, and as it bung head down
ward it cried piteously.
The older child was an undersized boy,
about 6 years old, who toddied around
alter the Â«oman thron h the rain ana in
and out of saloons. Wh -n Mr. Welcti cf
the Society for the Preventiun of Cruelty
to Cni.dren suw the woman and the cuil
dren, and realized how cruelly the chil
dren were being treated, he resolved to Â«cc
it be could not put a stop to that sort of
thing. Tne first thing was to secure an
assurance that the woman would be ad
mitted to the County Jail with her buby if
she should be convicted.
The fact, is well known that certain
Judges have said heretotore that they
could not well put a woman with a nurs
ing baby in jail. This has been the basis
of a trick on t c part of certain dissolute
wurjat-n who habitually tuk<- out a voting
child of very tender years when they start
upon a debauch for the purpose of pro
viding immunity for themselves if they
should be arrested. Sometimes, it is sus
pected, they have borrowed babies for the
purpose.
However that may be it has become the
fixed opinion of members of the Soc>ety
fcr the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
that the leniency of the Judges toward
the dissolute mother while intendeu es
pecially as a measure of mercy to very
tender children has really led to much
cruelty. There are several women who
constantly cover the cocktail route with
babes in arms.
The mortÂ»l effect of sending one of these
women to jail, Mr. Welch thinks, may be
good. That may be a way of keeping the
babies out of the rain and out of the
saloons if it is learned that the courts
take the stand that carrying a baby
around by a mother on a debauch consti
tutes an offense that will be severely oun
iahed. The Sanchez woman is charged
with cruelty to children.

THAT RISE IN THE
PRICE OF BREAD
It Is Agitating Bakers and
Dealers Throughout
the City.
And Will Agitate the Public, No
Doubt, if It Be Put
Into Force.
DEALERS STILL PROTESTING.
The Result Not to Be Known Until
the Next Meeting cf the
Bakers' Association.
The threatened advance in the price of
bread is still agitating the mind of the
public and of dealers in the staff of life â
the dealers other than the bakers them
selves.
The bakers who are members of the
Bakers' Protective Association are busily
engaged circulating a paper not only
aiong the line witnin the association but
among all the bakers of the City, seeking
signatures such as will pledge them to the
conditions of the resolutions adopted by
the association.
They are securing signatures very rap
idly among the distributing or "wagon"
bakers of the City â that is to say, among I
the bakers that run wagons and distribute
their wares to the branch bakers, grocers
and other dealers. They are all eager
enough to enter into the compact â con
tingent, of course, upon every other beÃer
entering and being bound by it.
Should not all enter the combine it
would bo impossible to carry out the plan
of the association, for the reason that
competition is so sharp that those bound
by the compact would immediately find
themselves at a great disadvar.taqe.
Those wtio refuse to sign do so for no
other reason man the fear of the loss of
trade. There are a number of grocers and
branch bakeshop-keepers who have estab
lished their trade on cheap bread â two
loaves for 5 cents â ana who have proved
such good managers and so energetic in
the quest of business that they are allowed
as high as 50 per cent commission on
sales. These dealers are loudest in their
protest against the resolutions of the as
sociation which restricts their commis
sion to 25 per cent. They declare that the
master bakers want to take out of the
traffic all that it will bear.
To grasp the situation it must be under
stood that not all lhe stores that wear the
sign of bakeries are in fact bakeries. Most
of these get their bread and pies and
cakes and such things from a wagon at
the door every morning instead of out of
an oven in the cellar, as may popularly be
supposed. It is the Keepers of these that
arp known as "branch stores" that will
suffer from ttie limi.ations imposed by the
commission clause in the resolutions of
the association.
It is the public, however, that is to really
suffer from the proposed combine. The
resoluti ns forbid the competing bakers
to give overweight in their bread. Noth
ing, however, is said about givinc short
weight. The language of the resolutions
is that no baker shall give "more" than
eighteen ounces in a5-ceutloaf and that
"this shall be t c standard," the larger
loaves heing ttaused in the same propor
tion. Many of the bakers now seek to
win trade by giving twenty and twenty
two ounces in the loaves that were sold at
retail for 5 cents. Very many of the
brunch stores sell even the heaviest
weight ana best-rated bread to the larger
customers at twenty-four and even thirty
loaves for $1, and many of the bakers sell
the lighter loaves at two for 5 cents.
The compact for the combine, as stated,
does not require any baker to increase the
weight of these light (oaves, but it re
quires the dealer to exact 5 cents for them
from the consumer.
Some of the dealers are themselves in
favor of tne combine, declaring that it is
impossible to sell bread at a eh aner rate
than 5 c nts a Inaf and leave the baker
and dealer a profit.
The result of the circulation of the com
pact for signatures will not be known un
til those who have it In charge report at
the next meeting of the Bakers' Protective
Association. Until then it cannot be cer
tain that the increase in price that is pro
posed can be maue to stick.

FIRES BURNING
ONCE AGAIN
Renewed Activity in the
Glass Works at Seventh

More Than One Hundred Indi
viduals at Workâ lacrease
Next Week.
THE DAWNING OF PKOSPERITY.
McX nley's Election Restores Confi
dence in This City as Well
as Elsewhere.
The f arnaces of the glass works, on Sev
enth and Townsend streets, which have
been rusting in idleness for so long, are
once more aglow, and smoke pours from
chimneys that for long have been unused
to soot and flame.
Blowers are cleaning up their rusty
blowpipes, melting-pots are bubbling, fires
are roaring, and once more the works are
filled with busy men and women.
There were at work in the different divi
sions more than a hundred individuals
men, boys and girls â and the pleased look
upon each face was proof that all felt sat
istied that good times have come again.
James H. Davis, manager of the works,
was in excellent spirits and very enthusi
astic when questioned as to the prospects
of the glass industry. "Yes," said he, "we
have started in good earnest, and we have
the best prospects for a bright and pros
perous future. The election of McKinley
has inspired confidence in those who
manufacture and those who have money
to invest, and that confidence seems to be
widespread.
"We started this morning with a force
numbering a little more than 100, and that
will be increased just as soon as the other
furnaces are overhauled and put in first
class condition. That will be inside of
two weeks, and then we shall have at least
250 at work. We are just now working
25 gins, but we shall put on 50. Have we
enough orders to justify us in employing
suchaforre? Yes, we have, and the in
dications are that we may require more;
and we can increase the force threefold,
for our furnaces are so arranged that when
working them at our full capacity we can
by working three eight-hour shifts in
twenty-four hours give employment to
nearly 750 people.
"I feel very hopeful," continued Mr.
Davis, "and cm confident that undex the
next administration we shall have the
prosperity which was promised to us.
When the Cleveland administration went
into power there immediately followed a
lack of confidence; people were afraid to
invest their money, but now that the Re
publican National t : cket has been carried
confidence has returned, ana every one
who has the means is doing his share to
insure prosperity."
HAWAII LIKES McKINLEY
Colonel P. C. Jones Sees Bright
Things for the Ka

Inter-Island Cables, Bond Sales and
Other Issues of Impor
tance.
Hon. P. C. Jones of Honolulu is ia the
City on bis way home, having spent some
weeks in New York trying to sell $3,000,
-000 of his Government's bonds. Owing to
the uncertainty of financial matters prior
to the election Mr. Jones found it impos
sible to negotiate the securities advan
tageously and ho has concluded to aban
don negotiations until the American
money market is easier.
Mr. Jones is one of the leading business
men of Honolulu and a prominent friend
of the Government. He is well informed
regarding matters of interest and spoke
last night to a Call reporter as follows:
"The triumph of McKinley inspires us
with confidence in the future prosperity
of the islands. I feel that the success of
the Republican party at this time means
more to us Hawaiians than almost any
thing that could have occurred, and the
Hawaiians I have seen are pleased at the
outlook.

now pending with us is the i <ter-island
and American cable project, which Colonel
Z. S. Spalding: is trying to promote. He
ha 9 the right for two years to push the
matter, and I believe he has incorporated
Jn New York for about $60,000,000. "With
the Republicans in power we feel that
there is more hope than ever for the com
pletion of his plans, which are very close
to us. Other men have proposed "cables,
but no scheme offered heretofore has been
so promising as his, which embraces both
the foreign and the inter-island idea.''
It is the idea of the Hawaiian Govern
ment to negotiate $3,000,000 in 4 per cent
bonds in lieu of all the issues now out
standing, which are at 6 ncr cent-. Colonel
Jones had to leave New York for home too
soon to negotiate the matter, but he has
received advices that McKinley's election
has already so loosened the money mar
ket that he will have no trouble in effect

CAN FITZSIMMONS
DEFEAT SHARKEY?
/
According to Records Tom
Will Have Hard
Sailing.
How the Cornishman Hood
winked the Sports of
This City.
THE SAILOR VERY SANGUINE.
Hall in a Prearranged Fight the Only
Man Who Ever Defeated the
Lanky Fitz.
If tbe records of fighting men are to be
taker into consideration when figuring
upon future performances, it doe^ rer
lainly seem, in the face of cold facts, that
Thomas Sharkey, the champion heavy
weight pugilist of thecoistand of Uncle
gam's navy, has but a meager chance of
whipping Bob Fitzsimmons, the elon
gated champion middle-weight fighter of
the world.
It cannot be gainsaid that Sharkey ha?
proven himself a man of extraordinary
vitality and one who is capable of taking
hard punching without ninchlng. In his
contest with Corbett he received some
heavy blows in face and body during the
first and second rounds of the bout, which,
with the exception of one powerful upper
cut that almost closed one of his eyes, he
did not seem to notice.
Corbett is not what 13 commonly termed
a "knocker-out," and he proved it conclu
sively in his last battle in this City. Con
sequently, no just comparison can be
drawn wnen figuring upon the sailor's
chances with Fn/.Â«immons, from Tbe mere
fact thht he held his gVund against an
extremely clever pugilist.
Fitzsimmons. although in the same class
with Corbett, has an altogether different
method of righting. His record will prove
that he is a< "knocker-out." or, in other
words, a man who has made short work of
his opponents. Corbett, on the other
Hand, relied solely on his remarkable
cleverness and ability to co a long distance
to win him a victory. The only battle of
short duration he succeeded in winning
asrainst a man of reputation was the one
lie engaged in with Charley Mitchell, who
at the time of the encounter was but a
mere shadow of his former self.
â Fitzsimmons is unquestionably a re
markable man; in fact, a more remarkable
being, pugilisiicaliy speaking, is unknown
10 the history of the ring. He commenced
as a middle-weight, and at the time when
he was a decidedly raw recruit in the pu
gilistic ranks he whaled many good men
who were rated as being pretty hard nuts
to crack. Finding that more money could
be made in hammering pu'gilislic aspira
tions out of would-be lighters than in
hammering shoes on the feet of horses, he
turned bis muscular back upon the forge
and went forth into the world in quest of
money and fame, both of which he ex
pected to attain by the power of his fists
That he was successful goes without
saying. He not only whipped the great
est of middle-weights, but the scalps of
many heavy-weight celebrities now dangle
from his belt, and still he is looking for
more worlds to conquer.
His record can show but one blemish.
Just previous to his departure from Aus
tralia to this country he met Jim Hall, on
February 10, 1880, in Sydney, and was
defeated in four rounds. Fitzsimmons
subsequently acknowledged to some of the
othcers of "the old California Athletic
Club mat the tight was a prearranged af
fair, and that he agreed to lose to Hall for
a certain consideration, because he needed
money badly.
Jimmy Carroll, who is now in training
for a ten-round contest wiki Jack McAu
liffe, under the auspices of the St. George's
Club, was an instructor at the California
Club when Fitzsimmons landed in this
City. "With the exception of a few direct
orÃ of the old club, to whom Captain
Aiorse. the then very popular officer of the
Australian liner Alameda, related nice
things concerning the pugilistic career of
the invader from the land of the Golden
Fleece, the member? and the critics on
pugilism paid little or no attention to the
youne man of flaxen hair and iqueun
construction.
Artful Jimmy somehow "smelt a mice."
and he soon had elongated Robert under
his wing. But Jimmy kept his council to
himself, and â¢Fitz" was not long breath
ing the pure atmosphere of the Pacific,
when he was matched to fight Billy Mc-
Carthy, who at that time was considered
as being a hard man to whip. Carroll
handler his prize cleverly, and the low
sports who were in the swim had many a
good laugn to themselves after noting the
expressions of disgust that invariably ap
peared on Jimmy's face when be joined
the crowd, after putting his charge
turough a little private exercise with the
mittens. Carroll always had hopes of
success, but he never lost an opportunity
to in'.orm the sports at large that he was
afraid McCarthy was too husky a chap for
his man Bob. I'oor Billy McCarthy, who
was one of the most honest lighters that
ever entered r. ring, was but a toy in the
hands of the Cornishman.
The contest took place on the evening
of May 20, 1890, and McCarthy went to
roost in the ninth round. Carroll and his
friends scooped in a nice penny on the re
sult. The lanky lad irom far-away Aus
tralia was now looked upon by ail local
aspirants to the middle-weight champion
ship as a dangerous customer, and as a re
sult Filzy had to look for new fields to
conquer.
H? journeyed toward the rising sun
and secured several small contracts in the
East. His fights of note were: George
Godfrey (colored), whom he whipped in
one round at Philadelphia, Pa., on May 7
1892. . '
It will be remembered by many mom
â¢vjrs of the old California Club that
Godfrey mude a lormidable stand against
Peter Jackson when the latter was in his
prime, and that Godfrey, after taking a
tremendous beating, acknowledged his de
feat in the nineteenth round by throwing
up both hands.
June 28, 1890, he whipped Arthur Ur>
ham in New Orleans in live rounds, and on
January 14, 1891, he conquered Jack
Dempseyin thirteen rounds. Spectators of
tne battle state that the Cornishman could
have easily whipped ''the Noiipareil" in
quicker time.
Peter Maher, the Irish champion heavy
weiuht, met and was defeated iff Fitzsim
moiis in twelve rounds at the Olympic Clnb.
New Orleans, March 2. 1892. t'itz met Jim
Hall again and whipped him in four rounds
at New Orleans on March 8, 1893. He
fought Joe Choynski on Jnne 17,189*. at
Boston, and had administered to the Cali
fornian such a terrible drubbing that the
police interfered, and the fight ended in
ihe fifth round. The referee declared it a
draw. He next met Dan Creedon in New
Orleans, on September 26, 1894, and Daniel
was put to sleep in the second round. The
second contest between Fitzsimmons and
Peter Maher, which was fought on Mexi
can soil, iÂ« stiil fresh in the minds of the
lovers of fisticuffs. Maher was knocked
out a:ter fizkting thirty seconds, but he
atiributes his defeat to his poor eyesight,
which was then greatly impaired."
Sharkey, the muscular sailor pueiltst
who will be the next man to engage in a
passage-at-arms with Fitz, has a record of
; having whipped several big scrappers In
â  Honolulu. But his principal victories aie
|as follows: Defeated Martin Muiverbili
â  in twenty-four rounds at Valiejo in 1894;
! defeated Billy Smith, at Colma in seven
] rounds: defeated John Miller at Colma in
i nine rounds; defeated Jim Williams of
Salt Lake in Mechanics' Pavilion; stayed
eight rounds with Choynski and won half
the Durse; fought Alex Greggains an
eight-round draw in the Bush-street
Tlienter; fought Corbett a four-round
draw in Mechanics' Pavilion and boxed a
i friendly hout with John L. Sullivati in
i Madison Square. New York.
Sharkey was in town yesterday for the
I first time since he took up training quar
ters at the beach. He was the object of
particular attention as he promenaded
along Market street. In conversation he
I said he never felt better in his life
and that he would give Fitzsimmons a
much greater surprise than he expects to
meet with on the evening of December 2.
"I can't understand," said the sailor,
*'why the papers do not give me as big a
boost as they give Corbeti, FitzsiinniouÂ«,
C'hoynski and the Die fellows who are
only looking for newspaper notoriety. My
record is as good as any of tfte heavy
weights. Didn't I make Choynski quit
richting, and were it not for the referee,
who stopped the fight temporarily when 1
punched him no hard iv the stomacn that
he resorted to a trick to gain time,
wouldn't I have knocked him out?
"I done exactly the same thing with
Corbett. A couple of hard jabs in tbe
stomach knocked the wind and fight out
of the talking champion, and then when
he was all but gone he resorted to bug
ging and clinching tactics to save himself
irom defeat; but of course poor Tom got
the worst ot it all round.
"Have I aeen Fitzsimmons? No. I have
not seen him, nor do I want to see him
until we meet in the ring; that will be
time enougn for me.
"How do I propose to tight him?
"I cannot tell you anything about it.
All! can say is that Fitzsimmons will know
that be has been in a ti>cht after I have
i got through with him. Good-day."
Kitsimmons. wife and child left this
City on the 1:35 o'clock boat yesterday
afternoon for Sausalito, where he will re
side until the day of the battle. A large
crowd of people saw the great pugilist on
board the ferry-steamer.
HIRSCH'S LUCKY STAR.
How the Supervisor's Fishing-Bod and
Umbrella Came Back After
Many Days.
Supervisor Atphonse Hirsch says that
his lucky star has risen and that he is
seriously contemplating embarking in the
first big enterprise that come his way.
Mr. Ilirsch has reason to consider himself
lortunale.
A year ago a handsome silk umbrella
with a curious inlaid silver handle, pre
sented to him by his wife, and a valuable
imported fishing-rod disappeared simul
taneously from his house, and he long ago
gave up hope of ever seeing them again.
Yesterday, as he was standing in front
of his Kearny-strcet establishment, he
saw a man passing who carried an um
brella that looked familiar. To think wa3
to act, and in an instant he bad stopped
the stranger and inquired 7ihere he jtained
possession of the rain-aetier, and was told
that it had been purchased recently.
"Well, it is mine," said the Supervisor,
"for there are my initials on the handle."
Sure enough, they were, and tbe stranger
consented to accept from Mr. Hirsch the
amount he hat paid for the umbrella and
also to tell the pawnshop where he bought
it. Mr. Hirsch was thinking of his lish
ing-rod when he asked about the pawn
shop, and at once made his way to the
place designaced.
'â¢Have you any fishing-rods for sale?"
he asked the proprietor.
The man at once produced the rod that
had disappeared with the umbrella, and
was dilating on its merits when Mr.
liirsch told him that tbe rod was stolen
and demanded possession. The man at
first demurred, but wuen shown the um
brella "aud given further proofs that the
articles rightly belonged to Mr. Hirsch he
gave in and surrendered the r&d. Hence
Mr. Hirsch's belief in his lucky star.
CLOTHES FOR THE POOR,
Bureau Whe#e One May Get a
Full Suit for Seventy-
Five Cents.
It Is Conducted at the Samaritan
Mission by Episco
palians.
There is connected with the Mission of
the Good Samaritan, on Second street,
near Fo.som, a department which en
ables the worthy poor to obtain warm,
clean, comfortable clothing at a yery
small cost and relieves them of the idea
of wearing "charity clothes. 1 '
This department, known as "The
Clothing Bureau," is the outcome of a
suggestion made by Mrs. Lanver, secre
tary of the Woman's Auxiliary of the
Episcopal church, at a meeting held about
a year and a half ago. and it has been in
operation about six month?. She stated
at that time that snch bureaus bad been
started in some Eastern cities and had
been found to be a great benefit. The
suggestion was acted upon by a number
oi ladies active in church wort, the work
of collecting and selling clothing was
started about six months ago and at this
time it i 3 under successful operation.
"This bureau." said Superintendent
Astredo of the mission, "is under the aus
pices of tho ladies of the Episcopal church,
who work in conjunction with the sisters
of the Order of the Good Shepherd. The
object is to furnish clothing to poor people
at a very low figure, yet "enough to give
them to understand that it is not charity
and that what they receive is theirs by
right of purchase. No person, however,
can purchase any clothing from the
burean without presenting a card.
"These cards," continued Superinten
dent Astredo, "are distributed to benevo
lent associations and prominent citizens,
and they are issued with the understand
ing that those who distribute them will
not do 30 until after a full investigation of
the condition of the applicants who want
to purchase clothing. This is to prevent
imposition.
"Persons of any creed are entitled to a
card, if deserving. The source of supply
to the bureau is contributions Irom the
charitably disposed. All the clothing that
)B brought here is of good quality."
Until the new home is finished the
bnreau is in one of the back rooms of tne
present mission. Yesterday afternoon
there were half a dozen women in the
bureau selecting such articles as they de
sired. One was looking at a pair of bot
tmes, but slightly worn, which were cus
tom made and must hare cost at least $5.
They were offered for 50 cents. Another
was examining a very pretty satque of
heavy blue material, which was marked
25 cents, and others were selecting under
wear. There are garments of all kinds,
which may be purchased for sums vary
ing from 5 cents to 50 cents, and none of
the articles are such that any of tbe pur
chasers nee.l be ashamed to wear them.
A suit may be purchased for about 75 cents.
The Fall Proved Fatal.
R. Lewellyn, an aged saloon-keeper, living
at 810 Potrero avenue, died yesterday in rhe
City and County Hospital from, injuries re
ceived on October 31. On that date he was
working on the front of tbe house No. 800 and
fell, breaking his arm ana collar-bone He
was removed to the t'uy and County HosDltal
where he soon showed signs of internal in
juries, ihe man's age, 64 years, was creatlr
against his recovery and he lingered until
yesterday when he expired. He was a nat<ve

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1896.
RESULT OF AN
OLD QUARREL
Michael McNally Dying at
the Receiving Hos
pital
The Shooting Affray Occurred
Opposite the Pac.fic Mail
Dock.
SELF-DEFENSE 13 THE PLEA.
J<Jhn Carney, a Marine Fireman, Who
Fired the Shot, Charged With
Assault to MurJer.
Michael McNally, a marine tireman, was
shot and fatally wounded yesterday after
noon by John Carney, also a marine fire
man, on First street, opposite the Pacific
Mail dock.
Carney was talking to two friends at a
John Carney, and His Victim, Michael McNally, in the
Receiving Hospital.
! horse trough on the corner of First and |
i Brannan streets about 1 o'clock when \
McNally and several friends, who had j
j been drinking, came up to him. One of
I them, either Mike McGinnis or Peter ;
i Barry, struck him in the face.
Carney to avoid trouble walked about j
{ fifty feet a'ong Brannan street and stood
j in frout of a restaurant, tmt McNally and
I his friends followed him. Seeing they '
I were bent on trouble Carney pulled out a
I revolver and warned them not to attempt
to strike him again or he would use his â 
gun. He walked away and turned the !
! corner onto First street, hoping that he I
would not be followed.
McNally and his friends still kept after j
j him, and he wheeled round and to!d them ;
i that if they persisted in menacing him he i
| would shoot. McNally threw off hiÂ« coat, I
and, declaring that be could thrash Car- I
ney, gnn or no gun, advanced toward !
him, while the others made a movement
to surround him. At this moment Car
ney fired, and the bullet entered Me- '
i Nally's chest. McNally staggered and !
j fell to tbe sidewalk. He rose to his feet :
j and some of his friends assisted him to i
j walk toward the saloon on the corner,
; where he again sank to the ground.
Dr. S. M. Terrell, a physician in tbe I
â  service of the Pacific Mail Company, who
was in the company's office, was sum
moned, and after making a hasty exami- I
nation of McNally pronounced his wound I
fatal.
Corporal Cockerill appeared upon the
; *cene and rang for the }>atrol-wogon. Me-
Nolly was taken to the Keceiving Hospital !
and Dr. Bunnell found that the bullet, â 
after entering his chest, had ranged down- I
ward and perforated the intestines. He '
also expressed the opinion that McNally
t could not live many hours.
After the shooting Carney walked toward :
the entrance to the .'Mail Company's j
wharf. Captain J. F. Anderson, the super- >.
intendent of the dock, who had been nott
tie>l of t lie shooting, met Carney and placed
him under arrest, taking the revolver from \
him.
Captain Anderson took Carney to a ,
cable-car at the ferry and conveyed him to
! the Receiving Hospital, where Corporal
: Cockerill was waiting for fieni. Carney
was ushered into the presence of McNally,
who at once identified him.
Chief Crowley had been notified of tbe i
; affray, and he sent Stenographer Heyne- j
niann to the hospital to take MoNally's '
j ante-mortern statement. Carney was de
! tamed till H-eynemann arrived. This is -
: McNally's statement:
My name is Michael McNally, and I am 22 !
i years ot age. I only came from the Kast a few j
| months ago. 1 did not have any trouble with I
\ the man who shot me. 1 do not'know him, but '
have seen him several nines. I never bad any
troub.c with thU man before. The shooting
i occurred a little after 1 o'clock. I took up !
' Pat McGrath's tight, a very good friend of !
| ruin â¢. I took off my coat and was golnsr to !
, fight Carney, when he shot me and I fell right
down. A coupU' of men had trouble with him !
Nobody struck McGratu to-day, but McUrath ,
and Carney had trouble.
Carney was then taken to the City
Prison and a charge of assault to commit !
murder was registered against him. He
objected at first to make a statement, but
finally did so.
"I shot in self-defense," said Carney. "I
j did not fire particularly at McNallv, but!
i into the crowd. I should think there
! were about a dozen of them. They had j
I been drinking, and while I was talKing to j
two friends, they came up to me, and one '
<of them hit me on the nose. I walked !
I alonp Brannan street to avoid trouble, but
i they came after me, and I pulled out ray â¢
gun and warned them to let me alone. I
then walked away for about 300 feet and !
â  they came at me again. McNally palled '
off his coat and so did two or three others, j
Thinking my life was in dancer, I fired at i
tbe gang. I did not specially aim at I
j McNally.
"This is the result of a bitter fight we
had in the Marine Firemen's Union about
two years ago over the election of a dele- i
! gate. There were two candidatesâ Barney I
: Ward and Con Harrington. I was "a j
friend of Harrington and worked for his I
election. We contended there had been
| fraud in counting the ballots, and the I
matter was taken before Judge Hebbard,
who decided in favor of Ward.
"Since then Ward's Jriends in the union
have been down noon me. Pjt McGrath
is one of Ward's friends and he was with
the gang to-day. About four months ago
McGrath called me a vile name on the
dock and after we eot outside the gates we
had a tight. I had the best of the tight,
but McGrath's friends, who wtre with him,
jumped upon mÂ« anU gare me a severe
boating. I had that experience in my
mind to-day when they came after me."
McNally arrived here on the steamer
Newport on her tirst trip from New Yorfe
a few months ago. He left that vessel and
made a f**w trips on the Australia. He
lived at 313 Seventh street. Pat McGrath
lives in the same house. He knew nothing
Cersonally of the trouble two years ago,
ut espoused the cause of his friend Mc-
Naliy.
Carney has been connected with the
Mail Company's steamers as fireman for a
number of years. He is well spoken of by
those connected with the company, who
say I hat he is a quiet, sober and industri
ous man. He is a single man and lived at
Burkes boarding-hoifte on First street,
opposite the company's wharf. The po
lice on the front give him the same char
acter.
William Wripht, who lives in the Win
chester House, was an unprejudiced eye
witness to the shooting. He told Cor
porai CocSerill that he would have done
the same thing as Carney if he had been
placed in the same position, and oflered
to appear as a witness in Carney's de
fense. D(*nnis Gallagher, Peter "Barry,
Edward Gray, Michael McGinnis and
John Gavin, who are ail employed on tbe
steamer Australia, and were with Mc-
Naliy at the time of the shooting, were
subpenaed as witnesses by Po. iceman
Videau.
Election of Truttees.
Mizpah Presbyterian Church has elected the
following board of trustees: Robert Dickson,
Cyrus S. Wright. I. J. Doanc, George W. Kidd,
Robert F. Jenkins, and Otto F. Himz as elder,
and George A. Gielow as deacon.
SEE YUPS DECLARE WAR,
Dead-Wall Posters Anathematiz
ing the Consul and Vice-
Consul.
General Denial That tha Ccmpany Is
Nothing but a H ghbinder
Organzaticn.
The See Ynp association has taken a new
tack in its effort to have Consul-General
Fung Heng and Vice-Consnl-General KinÂ«
Ow Ya;ig officially beheaded. Tiring of
the slow progression made in the courts,
they are endeavoring to educate their
countrymen into a realization of the al
leged unworth of the two officials in ques
tion by posting circulars on the dead walls
of Chinatown, proclaiming them the cause
of ail the disturbance existing of late.
The heading of the proclamation is:
"An explanation from tbe merchants and
laborers of the See Ynp Company." The
Consul-General is accused of being the
whole cause of the existing trouble, and
the e>ee Yups are eulogized as peacemaker j
and general exponents of the Confucian
beatitudes.
"Some lawless white men," the procla
mation asserts, "were paid to destroy our
property ana Droduce an excitement
which would lead ihe ignorant to refuse
to pay their company dues on departing
for China. Where are ac going to get
funds for our schools and the four com
panies? How are we going to send the
bones of our dead to China ?
"One wicked officer can destroy all the
harmony among us. Tiie greatest male
factor is a bad man appointed a police
officer by the Six' Companies, who pro
ceeds to exefte the Bo One Tong to make
trouble with the Bo Leong Tong. Lives
were lost to satisfy his purpose. He
therefore asked a pathway through 'ye' to
destroy 'Quick.'
"Taking these murders as a text the
Consul tells his superiors that he is merely
destroying the abodes of murderous high
binders. Where is his love for his coun
trymen? With Buddha-like lips be has a
wolf's nature.''
The policeman referred to is commonly
believed to be Lee Fook Ning or an asso
ciate.
The second part of Ihe article deals with
Yang, the Vice-Consul. He is accused of
nearly every crime in the decaloev.e, and,
in addition, with using the foreign news
papers to further his ends by informing
them that the See Yups are highbinder?.
These charges are made under the caption
of the "Ten Evils."
The circulars have roused great excite
ment in Chinatown and crowds of curious
Chinese are frequently >een grouped
around them. Vice-Consul Yang refuses
to make any statement in regard to the
posters, beyond asserting tbat the Consui-
Qeneral nas merely obeyed orders from
his Government, anÂ«i he himselt simply
fills the roie of interpreter. He does not
desire to see tbe strife given any more
publicity.
The case of the See Yupa asrainst the
Consul-General came up before Judge Mc-
Kenna in the United States Circuit Court
yesterday. The company asked for a per
manent injunction restraining the Consul
from further destroying or mutilating
their property and pending the hearing of
the permanent injunction a temporary
one was asked for. By consent of Yang's
attorney this was granted.
It is understood that, in spite of the in
flammatory posters tacked up by the See
Yups, a concerted movement is on foot
among the various organizations to make
peace with the Consul.

PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS.
The Resolution Au'horiziag the Erec
tion of the New Municipal

Two ordinances intended to enforce the
regulations provided by the Board of

were read before the Board of Supervisors
yesterday and referred to the Health and
Police and Judiciary committees jointly.
The first is aimed to prevent impure or
adulterated supplies being furnished pub
lic institutions, and reads as follows:

spection stations established by the Board of

ment of this order all persons, firms and cor

ceiving the contract for such supplies, one of
which samples shall be retained by tbe Board
of Supervisors, one of which shall be given to
the head of *uch municipal institution and one .
of which shall be deposited forthwith with
the secretary Â»f the Board of Health of this
City. All sucn food supplies shall be submit

supplies shall then and there be first inspected
and investigated, and said board shall make

Any person that shall violate any of the
foregoing provisions shall, upon conviction,
be punisbed by a fine of not more than $500,
or by imprisonment for not mwre than one

The second ordinance is intended to pre
vent the bringing into the City of impure
milk and meat. It is worded as follows :

the inhabitants at open public fcol inspection
stations esiablisned by the Board of Health.
The people of the City and County of Sau
Francisco do ordain as iollows:

to be used in the city for human or animal
food unless the same shall be submitted for in
spection for a period not to exceed one hour
at one of the open public food inspection sta
tions established by the Board of Keaith of
this city prior to its delivery for use as such
food.
Any person who sball violets any of the
provisions of this order shall, upon conviction
thereof, be fined not to exceed jfSOO or be im
prisoned not to exceed thirty days.
Both ordinances were prepared by At
torney J. B. Reinstein at the instance of
the Board of Health.
Another step toward beginning work on
the new municipal building was made
when the resolution authorizing the grant
ing of a contract for the erection of the
"Hall of Justice" was passed to print.
Bateman BroÂ«. are the contractors and the
price is $254,(300.
Shea & iShea, the- architects, were in
structed to prepare plans and specifica
tions for the placing of a clock in the
tower of the structure at a cost not to ex
ceed $3000.
It was recommended by the Municipal
Buildings Committee that the present
municipal building be designated as the
City Hall, instead of the New City Hali as
it has heretofore been called.
The Crocker estate sent in a communica
tion offering to convey to tbe City a strip
of land 27") by 69 feet, for the purpose of
extending Shrader street from Beulah to
Frederick. The matter was referred to the
Judiciary and Finance committees.
The Holly Park Improvement Club peti
tioned the board for better protection
against fire in the Holly Park district.
Tne matter was placed in the hands of the
Fire Department Committee.

ANOTHER CHARTER
Many Leading Citizens Ad
vocate Election of
'â ' Freeholders.
Charter Could Yet Bs Framed,
. 'Adopted and Submitted to
the Legislature.
PROMPT ACTION SUGGESTED
-Mayor Sutro Is Opposed to the Plan.
Other Election Commissioners
Are in Dcnbt.
Yesterday a number of active fupporters
oia new charter exchanged views iâ¢ the
. office of J. Richard Freud. As far as
â¢Joseph Britton. I. J. Truman, Mayor
elect James D. Pheiau and Mr. Dohrmann
can ascertain there is a widespread senti
. ment in favor of immediate action. It is
believed that an election can be called,
freeholders elected, the charter advertised
and submitted to the people at another
i election before the Legislature, which con-
A. 'venea next January, adjourns.
â¢ The members of the old Board of Free
holders and the representatives of the
Charter Association and the Merchants'
Association comprehend that much de
pends on the attitude of the Board of
Election Commissioners. The question of
money to defray tht expenses of two
elections may be regarded as the stumbling
block, but the advocates of the enterprise,
taking into consideration the amount
. which may ultimately De saved by the
adoption of a new charter, trust that the
Commissioners will take the responsibility
. of calling the election.
.It may become necessary for the friends
of the movement to secure a large peti
tion* asking the Commissioners to order
the election. It is sugsested that now is
'the time for action, in view of the fact
that the public mind is now interested in
the problem of good municipal govern
ment. Should the subject bs deferred for
two "years some time would be required
then to enlist the attention of the people
in behalf of the proposed reform.
Mr. Truman expressed the idea yester
â¢ day that the best provisions of the charter
recently rejected couid be embodied in the
new instrument. It is possible now to
perceive the objectionable features and
eliminate them from the charter to be
proposed.
A review of the subject published yester
day morning over the signature of Robert
Y. Hayne elicited some comment. The
opinion generally expressed was that the
adoption of a charter by the slow process
ot constitutional amendment was not at
ell necessary and that the amendments to
ths county government act and the con
struction of general Jaws by the Supreme
Court did not dictate tne proceedings aug^ j
gested by Mr. Hayne. The plea" was ad- j
Vdiice'd that the Supreme Court, in view
of the many complications already -jn
â¢v^lved. would welcome a solution of the
vexed question by affirming the constitu
tionality of a charter framed by free
holders, adopted by the electors of the
City and ratified by the Legislature.
Lawyers, the equal in ability of Mr.
Hayne, reflect that the framers of the con- j
satution designed to recognize the right
of local government in the broadest sense.
In ,\v It h holding from the Legislature the
power to amend a charter submitted for
ratification the principle of local govern
. ment v.as broadiy accepted by the framers
of the constitution. Judge McFarland of
the Supreme Court was a member of the
. Constitutional Convention and is, no
douht, familiar with the spirit as he cer
tainly is with the language of the consti
. tution. It is the judgment of
Mayor-elect Phelan that the fifth
constitutional amendment recently
adopted has cleared the way for the
immediate adoption of the charter. He
recommends that the county committees
of* the various political parties should con
fer and nominate the fifteen freeholders.
There should be one ticket in the field, but
the tictet should be representative of the
industrial, professional and business inter
. ests of the City. Mr. Phelan believes that
the expense of the two elections could be I
met without detriment to the funds of any j
' department.
H. N. Ciement hoids to the opinion that j
right now is the time for action on the I
charter. The taxpayers, and In fact all
classes of citizens, now comprehend the
necessity for a simple nnd piain instru
ment to take the place of the cumbersome |
and contradictory consolidation act and
the conflicting general laws. He main- i
tains that the Election Commissioner." in !
calling an election for fifteen freeholders :
would carry out the will of the people. It i
may become necessary for the people by !
petition to express the desire for the eiec- j
tion. The item of expense, of course, i
â  must be considered, but "Mr. Clement con- '
tends that money would be saved by call- â¢
ing the election at once. Waiting two |
. rears would increase rather than dimin- !
ish the cost.
. Some rough estimates of the probable
â  cost were made yesterday by Messrs. Trn- |
. man, Freud and Britton. The expense at I
the utmost for the two elections should
not exceed $50,000. One suggestion met i
with favor, an>i that was to tne effect that I
the leading commercial and labor organi- \
zations should be asked to attend a gen- j
eral meeting to discuss the question of the
charter. It was readily admitted that the j
provisions which were found to be un- i
popular in the charter recently submitted \
should be modified or eliminated alto- j
getlier from :he forthcoming charter.
It is figured that the freeholders would j
be able to revise and edit the charter '
within six days after organization, j
Should the Commissioners call trie elec- j
tion within the next week the instrument â 
could be framed and submitted to the i
people in ample time for its submission to I
the Legislature. In the event of eruer- |
â¢ gency tue session at Sacramento might be j
prolonged for a few days beyond the usual
time of adjournment.
Many citizens who discussed the topic
yesterday actnowledged that a new char
ter was needed. Hints were thrown out
that the Election Commissioners, who |
were recently re-elected to office lor two I
years, would hesitate to take steps tvhicti j
m ght rc-ult in shortening their terms of
office. On tiie other hand a sentiment j
was expressed that the Commissioners j
would respond readily if it should be
demons' rated that a large number of {
citizens were anxious for an immediate
election.
Mayor Sutro was interviewed last night.
He said distinctly that he would not as an
Election Comnussionei vote at this time
to call an election for freeholders to frame
a charter. He insists that a charter
A should not be hastily framed. It is a
I lundamental principle with him that
1 nothing should be done in haste. Above
\ all things in municipal affairs a charter
Should be the product of deliberate study,
A vast deal of thought and patient inves
tigation should be applied to the work.
He says, further, that the Board of Free
holders should employ at the expense of
the City an auxiliary committee consist
ing of twelve of the ablest lawyers in town
and that these lawyers should carefully
examine every provision of the charter |
and pass upon its constitutionality.
"What do shoemakers and merchants |
know about constitutional law?" said the j
Mayor. "I do not mean," said he, "to
speak in a derogatory way of any class of
citizens, but I do say that every clause of
the charter should be examined by
a committee of capable lawyersâ not
cheap, volunteer attorneys, but paid
lawyers of high standing in the proles
sion. It is perfectly absurd to think of
rushing a new charter through without
thought or deliberation. It is better to
wait two years and frame a charter to last
for a century. In doing anyihing it is
my plan to do it well. We can get along
for two years more under existing con
ditions. The City is not in debt. In this
respect San Francisco is an exception,
and we are better off than other great
cities.''
City and County Attorney Creswell said
at his home last evening that he favored
the holding of a special election of Free
holders. In response to the question
whether he as a member of the Board of
Election Commissioners would vote to
call such special election at once Mr. Cres
well had no positive answer to give. He
said that the case of Miller against Curry
and Kahn against Sutro mast be studied
thoroughly by him in connection with
the last amendment to the constitution
before he would be willing to express an
opinion on this point or would consider
himself qualified so to do. The Supreme
Court decision in the caÂ«e of Kahn against
Sutro made some officers county officers
and others municipal officers. The ques
tions involved in existing conditions made
Mr. Creswell think that a thorough and
careful investigation would be necessary
before he would reach any conclusion.
Auditor Broderick was also at his home
in the Mission, having been confined to
his house by sickness for several days.
He said that he had not come in contact
with people, and had no way to reach a
conclusion as to what the public desired.
"I do not think," said Mr. Broderick,
"ihat I ought to have any feeling in this
matter. I think that we need a new
charter, and I am in favor of bavin? a
new one, for now the condition of affairs
is chaotic. I want to act in accordance
with the wish of the majority of tho
people. If they want to have an extra
levy to pay the expenses of the special
election, they ought to have it. I think
that, as the head of the financial depart
ment of the City government, I could
help to raise the money necessary to pay
for a special election. But the point is
) whetuer the people want it. Perhaps
when I get out, I will be aDle to find out
how tl.ey feel. I could not without such
assurance throw over the salaries, which
would have to be done."
OVER FOR ANOTHER WEEK
â -. 1 -
The Attorneys in the Fair Will
Case Agree to One More
Postponement
Richard V. Dey Will Probably Have to
Produc; That Compromise
Contract.
By consent of all the attorneys engaged,
the trial of the Fair wiJl contest, 'which
was fixed on the calendar for yesterday
morning before Judge black, went over
until next Monday morning.
The statement was made Dy George A.
Knight, when the case was called, that the
attorneys bad agreed to the continuance
if it pleased the court to let it go over.
It really did not please the court, for
Judge Slack looked very much disgdsted
and stated that it was very disappointing
to nim that the request should be made.
He tnought the case would be ready for
trial.
Mr. Kr.ight explained that several of
the attorneys were engaged in tne trial of
:auses in and out of the City.
"Were these trials begun since this case
was set?" inquired Jultie Slack.
"No, sir," said Knight; "before."
Mr. Delmas explained that the Parker
Bvili case, in which he was engaged, had
aeen on trial for eleven weeks. It was on
irsument now, and his adversary, Judge
Paterson, would present his (Patcrson's)
;ase to-morrow (to-day). He, Delmas,
â vould not plead this &s a reason for post
ponement on bin iiar t, tie said, as, althougn
eery inconvenient, he would proceed with
his case if the court ordered. He had,
lowever, agreed to the postponement, as
le did not wish to inconvenience others.
"There are thirty jurors here, summoned
or this trial," said Judge Slack. "They
nust be paid."
"I will pay the jurors," said Knight,
md immediately began to look over his
â¢esources.
Previous to this Judge Slack an
lounced, with regard to the application
>1 l)elmas & Shortridge for an order of
;he court directing Richard V. Dey to
aroduce that $500,000 contract by which
t was proposed to coin promise the claims
jf Mrs. Craven, that it did not appear to
be material to the question ai issue.
Mt. Delmas called liis Honor's attention
!o certain statements in Mr. Dey's deposi
:ion that had escaped the attention of the
;ourt, and Judge Slack- stated that the
ienial nhouid not be recorded as final,
aut if at any future time it might be
â hown that the instrument was indeed
material to the isue then the order for
its production would De made.
All the attorneys agreed that no further
postponement would be asked.

SHARKEY'S DIAMOND STUD
It Was Presented to James
Wales, a Salesman, on
Saturday.
Wales Wss Arrested for Being Drunk
end Dec ares Hs Was Drugged
and Robbed.
James Wales, a salesman, 27 years of
age, was arrested about 4 o'clock Sunday
morning on Eddy street by Policemen
Snowball and Wilson ana sent to the City
Prison in the patrol-wagon on the charge
of drunkenness. When searched the only
thing they found in his pockets was a
knife.
Wales was released yesterday morning,
and on ascertaining that the only thing
belonging to him was a knife he declared
he had been drugged and iobbed, and said,
he would find the people who did it.
Little attention was paid to his state
ment, as it is quite a usual tiding for men
arrested for drunkenness to declare when
sober that they had been robbed.
Last night Wales' wife called at the City
Prison in a great state of excitement. She
I asked what property her husband had on
him when arrested, and when told she
said: "My husband has been drugged and
robbed. On Saturday morning he went
to Tom Sharkey's training quarters and
Sharkey, who is a friend ol his. presented
him with a diamond stud valued at $200.
"He showed me the stud and took it
away with him. He had also some money
with him. lam sure he has been drugged
and robbed, as he is not a drinking man."
Mrs. Wales was advised to go to police
headquarters and report the case there.
This was done, and as soon as Ler hnÂ«

band turns up from his search a detective
will interview hint and endeavor to find
out what has become of the diamond stud.
LOTTERY-DEALERS CAUGHT
Successful Bald on an Agency on Sutter
Street.
Success at last crowned the efforts of
Sergeant Anderson and his police posse of
Chinese gambler raiders. For a long time
he knew that Chinese lottery tickets were
being sold in a laundry in the basement
of 244 Sutter sireet, but the Asiatics were
so olever in hiding the evidence 01 their
illegal traffic that the police were unable
to catch them. Yesterday Sergeant Ander
son and his men made a rush on tne
place and caught the lottery agency in
full operation.
Six Chinese laundrytnen were arrested
for aiding and abetting a lottery. Nathan
Kiink, Joseph Bundy and Joseph Marino
were also in the place purchasing tickets.
They were arrested on the same charge.
After considerable search a large lot of
lottery tickets were found in a sheet that
was hung upon a ciothes-line with other
laundried clothes.
Stabbed With a Knife.
F. Perfetto of 1326 Dupont street swore to a
complaint in Judge Joachimsen's court yester
day charging Joseph Marino with assault with
a deadly weapon. Perietto said he was play
ing billiards Sunday night iv the Musicians'
Exchange saloon, on Montgomery avenue,
when Marino entered and began to annoy him.
Perfetto remonstrated with him and Marino
drew a knife and stabbed aim.
Stars vs. Alerts.
The management of the Presidio grounds
has arranged to give the public a baseball
treat next Sunday in the form of a game be
tween the Stars of Nevada and the Alerts of
Alaxneda. The contest will be for a purse,
and some lively work is looked for.
MORE SPACE IS NEEDED
California Proposes to Make an
Exceptionally Great Exhibit
in Guatema'a.
j Merchants Will Not Display Their
Goods, However, if They Are Not
G yen Ad quate Facilities.
Chairman liundschu of the Guatemalan
Exposition committee of the Chamber of
i Commerce presided yesterday at the
executive session of that committee.
Carl H. Clark was selected temporary
secretary and given the task of inter
viewing personally the twenty-six firms
that have signified willingness to exhibit
in March next at Guatemala.
These firms will have to promise to pay
$fSO toward the general expense fund and
;$2 per square foot of space occupied. If
j this amount exceeds necessary expenses
i the surplus will be distributed among ex
| hibitors pro rata. Should the amount
i fall short, however, the different firms
| must agree to make up the deficit pro
rata.
Among those present at the meeting
were N\ \V. Spauldlng, Percy Morgan, P.
Lilienthal, J. P. Currier, M. Hirsch, J. A.
Filcher and Nathan Bonrrnann.
Chairman Hundschu stated that in view
of the fact that only 2500 square feet had
been allowed to exhibitors Irom California
and that the space was entirely inadequate
to the requirements he believed a further
demand should be made.
It was resolved that a cablegram should
be sent immediately asking for 6000 square
feet.
In answer to the question of Percy Mor
gan, representing the California wine in
terests, as to what action should be taken
if Guatemala refuses additional space, the
reply was blunt and to the poiut: "We
will not exhibit there."
GAME OUT OF SEASON.
Restaurant-Ownera Object Strongly to ft
law That It Not Enforced.
Owing to the few arrests that have been
made by the officers of the Fish and Game
Commission, and also the Game Warden,
of men who are openly selling game out
of season, the proprietors of restaurants
and eating-houses have taken advantage
of dereliction of the c fticers and are now
selling both quail and wild ducfe to cus
j tomers.
August K. Drucker of the Wilson Res
taurant said last evening that he did not
propose to transgress the law, but he
thought that the Commissioners and the
i Game Warden should either enforce the
1 law or openly state tliat arrests would not
be made of those Having game in their
possession. With few exceptions the
commission-houses are all selling game
now, which fact is known to the Game
Warden.

Woon Tuck Wo, convicted of killing Lee Ti,
on July 20 of this year, was yesterday sen
tenced to the State Prison for life by Judge
Belcher. In denying a motion lor a new trial
Judge Belcher sa;d he thought it his duly to
take that ourse, though he recognized the
fact that he could not foresee how the Supreme
Court would view his decision.
HAS NO FURTHER
DESIRE TO FIGHT
Authority of the Railroad
Commission Is Again
Acknowledged.
The Southern Pacific Averse to
Additional Legal En-v
tanglements.
NEW RATE SCHEDULES FILED
Victory for tha Stale Secured Only
on the Threat of Court Pro
ceedings.
All disposition on the part of the South
ern Pacilic Company to again lock horns
with the Railroad Commission in the
courts has evidently disappeared, at least
pending the long-delayed decision in the
case of the railroad corporation against
the Railroad Commission to restrain the
latter from reuueiug rates.
From the day that this suit was insti
tuted, more than a year ago, the officials
of the railroad company, acting uudoubt
ediy under orders, br.ve fuiied to hie with
the commission any of the new rate sched
ules, and even refused to hie its annual
report, until threatened with legal pro
ceedings. In fact the commission's exist
ence was deliberately ignored by the cor
poration.
This action, according to the views of
the majority of the commission, was taken
in order to maintain tne position the
Southern Pacific took in the pending suit
that the existence and organization of the
commission was unconstitutional.
No special attention was paid totlie,sulk
iness of the railroad so long as its defiant
attitude did not interfere with the busi
ness of the commission. Rates could not
be changed by the commission, in any
evet.t, until Judpe McKenna rendered his
decision.
But when the time came to send the
copy for the Commissioners' annual re
port to the State Printer it was found that
the annual report of the Southern Pacific
Company was missing. A polite request
for it was penned and forwarded, but not
even an answer was vouchsafed. Then
came a more formal demand. Tnis was
met by evasion. At last resort was had to
the counsel of Attorney-General Fitzger
aia, and only when threatened with legal
proceedings did the officials and it advisa
ble to tile their report. This victory of
the commission was acuieved only a few
weeks ago.
Notices of rate changes were, however,
still withheld from the commission. Hav
ing enforced their authority in the matter
of the annual report, the Commissioners,
just to keep their hand in, invited the rail
road to again play in their yard to the ex
tent of filing their new rate sheet. But
the same plan of dunnint; had to be pur
sued, and it was only when the alterna
tive was laid before them of being com
pelled to answer to a summons or file
such schedules that the iutter were forth
coming.
The result of the commission's victory
in this case was the recent procuration of
a stack of revised rate sheets several
inches hi^h. These include ail the new
rates issued from as far back as August,
1895, to the present day. Most important
of tiiese are the greatly reduced grain and
general merchandise rates forced upon
the Southern Pacific by the competition
of the Valley road.

COSTS MORE THAN COFFEE
i - â â  â ; â  ;.
The New Beverage Is Expensive in
.. Some Families.
A gentleman while making the morn-
ing purchases in the family grocery said
they found Postum, -the. health - coffee, 7
rather expensive at his house. "We drink
more of it than we used -to of coffee be-
cause the children all drink it, and there
are . four of them, and wife and myself. >.
That makes six using Postum, while for-
merly I was the only one who -drank
coffee; wife used it now and then, but it
I didn't agree with her.
" "Send up two packages of- the Battle
Creek, Mich., Postum Cereal. We find it
is lood and nourishment, and for the same
money we get three cups of Postum to one
of coffee. The way my > family drink it,
however, it costs us more that! coffee, but
we B*ll feel well, and that is something. . â¢
. ."The old liver trouble I used, to have is
gone. I suppose. because I have quit using
I the article that caused the trouble. I
don't believe much in drugs, for if nature
is given a fair show it will make most any,
one well." â¢â  ' - ' â  â¢â 
" Dr. J. B. S. King, Prof. Chemistry and
Toxicology, 240 Wabash Aye., Chicago,
says, "Will be glad to adopt Postum for
my children as a daily beverage." â

imitations of â¢ Postum Cereal coffee if the
customer will stand it.

CPrCAGO, fix.. Nov. 9.â Wheat was strong to
day tnd, considering the sharp advances In out- |
side domestic markets, particularly Minneapolis, |
the strength was not 'at all surprising Foreign 1
advices were also favorable, and the local crowd
under the circumstances could not consistently be
other than bullish. Liverpool quoted \\<X ad- I

close. Receipts* in the Northwest were lighter,

CORNâ i_ike v generally does, corn followed
wheat In Its rise The trade In the marKet snowed
the symptoms of revival and the advance in price j
which took place was unaccompanied by anything .
I parti ular.y Interesting, commission houses had j
a few orders to execute, but the bulK of the busi- i
ness nti tor floor trader* and scalper. . Receipts !
were 217 cars and 108.377 bushels were taken

BOATS â enhancement of prices of the other

; by wheat detracted from the speculation moats'
as well as other commodities. Receipts were 181

THE CONSTABLE'S STAVE
A Weapon Slore Formidable Than the
Modern Policeman's Club.
Tho Home Secretary, Sir Matthew White
Ridley, has just secured from Northamp
ton two relics of the past that are pecu
liarly associated with the Department of
the State, of which he is Minister. These
are two staves, at once the badges and in
struments of office of the village consta
bles of long ago. when men's lives were
considered of iess account than they are
now.
The staff of those days, probably 200
years ago, was a formidable, not 10 &ay
bloodthirsty, instrument of offense. I
have been able to obtain one of the fame
sort. Mine was formerly the property of
the parish constable of Brington. Eng
land. It consists of two partsâtrunch
eon, or handle, lathe turned, ten inches
long, and a sphere, three inches in its
lonpest and two and a quarter in its short
est diameter. Both handle and ball are of
boxwood. They are united by a strong
double thong of white leather, fastened by
iron pegs into apertures bored into both
handle and ball.
The ball has two inches of play on the
leather, so that from end to end the instru
ment is fifteen inches long. As the ball
hangs loosely about the straight handle
some decree of force is required to brinn
it into action; but when mis is done the
execution the weapon is capable of is
somethins dreadful. A moderate blow
cannot be struck by it; witn very little
exertion on the part of the bolder a man's
head, leg or arm would be very easily
broken. No doubt some such powerful
weapon was required in the "good old
times." â Northampton Mercury.

UPPER HARBOR
Big Event in the History
cf the Development
of Oakland.
Huge Bunkers Christened With
.. â¢ the First Cargo to Pass
the Bridge.
BIG IMPROVLM NTS COMPLETE.
Acres of Valuable Improved Land
Now Take the P.ace of a
â¢ j Useless Marsh.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
. .'â¢" 908 Broadway, Nov. 9. J
The first vessel to bring a cargo to the
.huge bunkers that have been built at the
foot of Alice was docked this even
â  inp. It is the L. G. Burgess, and on many
.occasions public celebrations have been
â¢ held over events of far less significance.
. For nearly two years vast improvements
have been going on near Adams Point
Yesterday Was an Important Day in the History of Oakland's Development. The Large Bonkers and Wharves Which Constitute
a Portion of Vast Improvements Were Used for the First Time. The American Ship L. G. Burgess Docked and
. â¢ Commenced to Unload Her Cargo of CoaL
and some very heavy investments have
been made. To-day the lofty bunkers are
clean and â ornamental. To-mor
row they will be black and grimyâ useful.
The first bucket of coal that is taken
from the hold of the Burgess marks the
\ beginning of Greater Oakland. No big
vessel with a cargo has been so far up the
'estuary because till to-day there was no
' -wharf and no channel. The long wharf is
Â" one of the most substantial that could be
built, and behind it are many acres of
land made with estuary mud on what was
till recently a useless marsh. â¢ Now it is
as flat as a plateau and furnishes room
for a score of warehouses or manufactur
ing plants. . - .: â¢â i.;*
â¢HTbis method of reclaiming land has
.been done to a creat extent along the
piers leading to the ferry depots, but the
Â improvements opened to-day are above
â¢the bridges and in a part of the estuary
lung neglected. The bunkers at present
â¢ .completed are leased to the Oregon Im
provement' Company, and they are the
owners of the first deep-water cargo taken
above the bridges.
There has always been somewhat of an
* air of mystery hanging over the vast im
, provements that are oeine undertaken on
the Adams water-front property. They
* are on property that is not clouded with a
The Dotted Line Indicates Oak
land's Great Hope*
breath of Sonthern Pacific ownership and
are on a scale altogether beyond what ap
pears to be the actual needs of the pres
ent time. It is more than supposed that
Adams Point wili soon be the tide-water
terminus of a line from Corral Hollow.
James P. Treadwell and others in
terested in immense investments at Corral
Hollow have already expressed thn
opinion that a connection with tidewater
in San Francisco Bay is an actual neces
sity. There is only one natural outlet uiid
that is the Oakland water front. The new
wharves are located on a portion of the
front that is not controlled either legaily
or illegally by the railroad company, and
there is room for half a dozen depots.
From Btockton to Fresno there is a line,
Jrom Stockton to Corral Ho low there is
another, and to cover the thirtv-seveii
miles from the coal mines to wl.arv.-H and
bunkers already built is firmly believed to
be the plan of the promoters.
The Burgess was docked without diffi
culty, and her arrival was witnessed by a
crowd of people who never expected to see
a commercial depot of such pretensions at
the foot of Madison street. For years the
estuary above the bridges has been the
abode of laid-up whalers and condemned
hulls, but with the advent of deep-water
ships the "bone yard' 1 will have to be
moved to a place where improvements
come not.
The necessity of having one substantial
bridge across the estuary in the place of
the two ancient structures mat now span
it is doubled, for it is dangerous at times
to attempt to tow a loaded vessel through
the drawbridges, and it is likely that now
the Adams Point wharves are opened,
there will be heavy traffic on the upper
estuary.

AN ORCHARDIST'S DEATH.
Dr. Kimball Wag a State Horticultural
Commissioner.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 9.â Dr. KimbaU
a well-known orchardist of Castro Valley,
died to-day. Dr. Kimball was born in
New York sixtv-nve years ago. He went
to Australia during the cold excitement in
1853, an<l nine years later came to this
State. He practiced his profession until
1564, wnen he went to Haywards and be
came an orchardist. He was a scientific
man and made a very useful record as a
member of the State Board of Horti
culture.
Two months ago Dr. Kimball's wife
died, and her death undoubtedly hastened
the orchardist's end. The funeral services
will be held at the Congregational church
at Haywards to-morrow afternoon.

908 Broadway, Nov. 9. f
The Christian Endeavor societies of
Oakland are uniting with the societies
throughout the worla this week in proy
ing for the Armenians. The movement
was set on foot a month ago by a telegram
from Dr. Francis E. Clark, who is now
making bis second trip around the world.
He urged concerted action by the societies
on this continent with all others for the
s' fferers. Secretary John Willis Baer of
Boston seconded his efforts, and by means
of the Golden Rue, the official organ of
the organization, communicated with ttie
local societies, and all have joined in pray
ing for ti e overthrow of the Sultan and
lreedom for the Armenian Chrstians.
The visit of Mr. Baer, which was post
poned owing to the (lection, will take
place next week. S. W. Condon, presi
dent of the Aiameda County union, an 1
H. J. Waters, president of the Oakland
City nnion, will meet Mr. Baer at Port
Costa Monday afternoon and escort him
to Oakland. Ail of tie officers of the
coumy, Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda
unions will serve as a reception com
mittee and meet their secretary at the
Sixteenth-street depot on toe arrival ot
the 4:09 P. m. Los Angeles express. A
rousing reception wili be tendered Mr.
Baer at the First Conn relational Churcu

Postinanter for Haywards.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 9.â A very lively
fight is being waged in Hay wards for the
otfice of Postmaster. The term of John
Obermuller, the incumbent, wil: soon
expire and some good Republicans
want to be his successor. George (Jake-,
Fred Hoyt and Alonzo Bradford are al
ready in the field. Oakes is, however,
easily in the lead. His newspaper, the
Haywards Journal, was an ardent advo
cate of McKinley and Hilborn, and he
doubtless helped to overturn Eden Town
ship's Democratic majority. George O-ikes
is the son of the weli-known caterer of the

THE SATST FR AS CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10. 1896.
THEIR ELEGANT
HOME IS READY
The Ebell Society Will
Open Their Classic Club
house Saturday.
They Can Boast of the Best
Appointed Headquarters
in the State.
ARE PROUD OF THE INTERIOR.
An Immense Auditorium and Over*
head a Ec utifu! Ballroom in
White ani Gold.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 9. j
Next Saturday evening the ladies of this
city known as the Ebell Society will for
mally open their new clubhouse. It is
the first building of its kind in Alameda
County, and its inaugural will be a marked
social event.
The Ebeil Society ia a fashionable liter
ary organization, which has been in ex-
istence over two years, and now boasts of
a very large membership. A few months
ago the club decided that it would like to
have exclusive headquarters and an agree
ment and lease were entered into, the re
sult of which was the building now com
pleted.
The style of the Ebell's new house it
Italian renaissance and the ladies are all
pleased with its classic lines.
The main auditorium is a Greek room
of fine proportions. There is nothing to
obstruct the space except a few lonic pil
lars. The walls and ceiling are in olive,
with bronze dado and friezes. To the
right is the library and to the left of the
main entrance are reception and dressing
rooms, fini ? hed in cur.y redwood. Sepa
rate rooms for the various literary sections
or classes are placed in each corner of the
auditorium. Arrangements exist by
which the stage may be reached without
passing through the auditorium.
On Thirteenth street is the main en
trance. The broad stairs leading to the
corridor are flanked by Doric pillars. The
facade faces Thirteenth street and is
classic in every detail.
The upper floor will be a ballroom and
ie finished throughout in white and gold.
An observation gallery extends across the
south end of the hall and a supper-room
is provided for off that gallery. The en
trance will be on Harrison street, distinct
from the Ebell rooms. The approach to
the ballroom will be a wide staircase of
easy ri-Â«.
Altogether the Ebell Clubhouse is supe
rior to anything of the kind that exists in
this part of the State. The ladies criticize
very favorably the designs of Walter
Matthews, the architect, and are very
proud of their clubhouse.
During the coming season tnere will be
several fashionable balls given in the
beautiful ballroom and it is probable that
other fashionable gatherings other than
those under the immediate direction of
the Ebell Club will be held there. The
programme for next Saturday night is not
fully completed, but will be very elabo
rate.
The officers of the society are:
President, Mrs. O. W. Bunnell; vice-Dreii

a resident of Oakland. Mr. Egan, whose
family live on Twenty-first street, is
owner of a ranch near San Miguel, Mon
terey County. This afte noon he was
hunting with a companion. They crossed
a fence, and Mr. Egan was pullinc his gun

struck Mr. E.'an on the chin and he ex
pired before medical aid could reach him.
Martin Egan, the son of the deceased, is

. .- , ,"i'-.;Hei Maiden Name. ;
.. OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. W. R. Quinan
was granted a divorce to-day from Caro
line B. Quinan on the ground of
willful desertion.
The plaintiff is the assistant * superin
tendent of the powder works â at Pinole
and the family reside at Twelfth and Fil
bsryt'treeis.i. This :is the second time the
case has been tried. : Mrs. Quinan 's attor
ney asked permission for his client to re
sume her maiden name. : â 
Although no objection was made by
Mr. Quinan Judge Ellsworth refused 10
grant the request. He said the defendant
was the motiier of children who bore the
name of her husband, and she was well
advanced in years. It was proper, the
Judge held, that she should continue to
bear her name in marriage. Beside*, it
was the fault of the woman alone that
the divorce has been occasioned, because
!<be d-'liberately left her home, anu al
though she returned to it later she re
vs d to act as a wife or to take charge of
: lie home.
The Quinans are quite prominent in
social circles and the divorce occasioned
some surprise.
Only 35 per cent of the people of Paris
were born there.
EX-SENATOR DORSEY
HERE FROM LONDON
He Will Erect a Great
Stamp Mill at
Picacho.
Big Gold Ledres to Be Developed
and Abou. 500 Men Em
ployed.
MORE BRITISH MONEY COMING
The Ex-Senator on the Money Situa
tionâHis S rang 1 Career and
Present R se.
Ex-United Senator Stephen W. Dorsey
arnveo here yesterday, havinp come direct
from London, and is at the Palace. For
several years the ex-Senator's home has
been in Denver, and for a year and a half
past he has b -en interested in a large
group of gold mines near the Colorado
River, twenty-eig t miles from Yuma, in
Southern California.
He went over to London to get money
to develop these mines. He succeeded in
getting a lot of it and will now erect a
100-stamp mill and employ 400 and 500
men. Mr. Dorsey says he got the needed
money conditionally on McKinley' s elec
tion. If Bryan had been elected he would
not have got a dollar.
Tiie ex-Senator says also that confidence
among London capitalists nas greatly re
vived by the result of the election. He
says a great deal of money will corse to
the California gold fields for development
during the ensuing year.
"These British capitalists," he contin
ued, "are not buying mines outright, but
they will put up money for interests and
to be used in development, letting the
American seller retain an interest and
manage t:.e property. They do not care
any more to send an English manager
over here. But having taken an interest
and paid the money, they put up a certain
part of the stock for sale and let the pub
lic in.
"The men of whom you hear as repre
senting English syndicates in this coun
try are usually frauds. Ten to one such a
man, if the truth is known, doesn't repre
sent any syndicate, and likely as not he
will be striking the first mau he sees for
$1 for dinner.
"These capitalists are very shrewd and
sharp. They are as nood business men as
the shrewdest o' Yankees. I think by the
election of McKinley that there will be
great prosperiy throughout the country,
and especially in the West. I think it
means a great deal in the way of the de
velopment of the goid mines. I have
known Mr. McKinley as long as I have
known anybody. He is an able, conser
vative and entirely safe man. His ad
ministration will, in my judgment, be ad
mirable.
"Many silver men throughout the coun
try voted for Mr. McKinley because they
did not like some of the "planks in the
Chicago platform. The one condeming
the Supreme Court, and the other criti
cizing severely the Presid-nt for calling;
out the troopa at the time of the Chicago
riot, were particularly objectionable. Mr.
Bryan, while a very brilliant man, was
hardiy old enough, and the coining of
silver free was too s rious a proposition
under the circumstances. I was always
the strong friend of silver, but there ought
to be some restriction on it, for the reason,
for instance, that Mexico has far more
silver than the United States. She could
send $100,000,000 a year here.
"In Colorado, where 1 live, there are a
good many friends of silver who believe
that Jar. McKinley will, all things con
sidered, make an admirable President.
"The mill which I will erect will be at
Plcacho, twenty-eight miles north of
Yuma. We have a 15-stamp mill there
now, but the new one will be a 100-stamp
and will treat an enormous amount of ore.
We have some large ledges. The ord runs
from ?5 to $6 a ton, it being about twice as
rich as tliat of the Alaska Treadwell mine.
"I will also build a railroad five and a
half miles long to carry the ore from the
mine to the mill, which will be located on
the bank of the Colorado River."
Ex-Senator Dorsey has had a stranee
career. He was promineut in Ohio poli
tics ior a time, then went to Arkansas,
from which State he was elected Senator.
He had meanwhile engaged in a great
railway enterprise from which he made a
vast sum of money.
Coming to Colorado and New Mexico he
engaged in cattle-raising. He had previ
ously been a Government contractor, his
contracts being largely for carrying United
States mails throughout the West and
South. These were largdy what were
known as star route contracts, and in
connection with these the Government
brought suit charging great frauds. Dor
sey spent avast sum in defending himself,
employing Robert G. Ingersoll and other
eminent attorneys. His cattle business
finally failed in the West, and in recent
yeurs he has been reported as utterly
ruined. A Chicago paper not long ago
reported a judgment against him of $450
for a piano.
But* the ex-Senator is on bis feet again.
His eye- are dark brown and piercing, and
he talks and acts like a nrnn who had
plenty of confidence in himself. There is
a suggestion of Biaine about him in his
dash and in the look of his face, which is
lion-like and full of strength. His hair is
getting pretty gray. He wears it short,
us c does his beard, which is of the Van
dyke style. He will probably be here
several days.

REV. MR MILLER
AND FANCY FAIRS
Objects to Eating Oysters
in the Name of Re
ligion.
He Says Christians Should Give
Without Getting a Quid
Pro Quo.
The Presbyterian Ministerial Union had
a "quiz day" yesterday and one of the
questions propounded was, "What are
your views concerning the raising of
money for church purposes 07 means of
bazaars and fancy fairs?"
Rev. O. C. Miller, being called on to lead
the discussion, gave forth his views with
no uncertain voice. After describing how
Christ threw the money-changers and the
merchants out of the temple he touched
on modern church entertainments and
methods of raising money thereby. "They
are indeed worse," said Mr. Miller, "than
the state of things that Christ found in
the temple."
Clambakes, oysterbakes and other forms
sometimes taken by church socials were
described and the speaker said:
"How could we enjoy them if we real
ized that Christ was there? I think these
desecrations have arisen through our not
realizing that it is the house of God.
Christ said: 'Do not make my father's
house a house of merchandise.' Paul
spoke against such things when be said:
'Have ye no houses to eat in?' The bcrip
tures say that we are not to give for the
sake of receiving. If a man eats a plate
of oyster soup for the sake of Christ be
also eats because he likes it."
Mr. Miller clinched these remarks with
several anecdotes; one of them was about
a city in the East with a number of
churches, all of wnich had been built by
eating, and another was of a man who,
trying to sell a bazaar ticket, was chided
by an infidel with the remark: "One
would think your God was bankrupt."
The speaker concluded his remarks by
stating that nothing could be found in the
Scriptures to justify the raising of money
for church purposes by means of bazaars
and fancy fairs.
Rev. F. A. Doane, who was appointed to
continue the discussion, said he frankly
owned the principle was wrong, but when
a board bill was staring a man in the face
he thought one was compelled to look at
tbo matter in a broader light. He con
sidered that a sale of work, in a hall,
where the sales were conducted legiti
mately, was not a violation of any divine
law. Dr. Ketchum said that God had laid
down a rule: '"People were to give tytnes
of all they possessed to supply the church
funds." Rev. J. R. Reynolds thought
socials and entertainments could be made
n means of conversion.
The second quiz question was on the
effects of revivals by traveling evangelists.
Rev. Dr. Ketchum said that in his experi
ence the result had been disastrous, as
the enthusiasm inspired was only super
ficial. Rev. Dr. Marshall testified to the
success of revivals.
Mme. Marie Marshall, who was present,
stated that the French Reformed Church
was $400 in arrears for rent, and that un
less aid were forthcoming it would soon
1 aye to be closed. She begged the clergy
men present to do all in their power to
help a concert which was being arran. Ed
to raise the much-needed mon jr. Dr.
Ketchura reported lor the Sabbath-ob
>ervance commiitee and commented on
the apathy of many r>rofe-sing Christians.
Resolutions commending the work of
Rev. Thomas Marshall were adopted.

Rev. C. G. Milne* represented the ne da

SLUSHY GOING
MIXED UP FORM
Four of the Six Favorites j
Beaten at Ingle
side.
Willie Martin Rode a Bad Race j
on the Hot Favorite
Salvable.
OLD BRAW SCOT WAS FIR9T.
Imp. Miss Brumm;l Badly Beaten.
Caliente Romped Home an
Easy Winner.
Four favorites beaten, a slushy track
and just a little fog were th* chief charac
teristics of the opening day of the week at
Ingleside. Mud was always a strong fac
tor in upsetting form on racetracks, and
yesterday was no exception. However,
none of the winning horses were alto
gether neglected by speculators, and the
members of the ring did not add greatly
to their bank-roll. The attendance
showed ell of the regulars at their posts,
and the usual number of ladies were pres
ent in the grand stand.
Undoubtedly the most popular win was
that of Barney Schreiber's gray gelding,
honest old Braw Scot, who captured the
second event at odds of 15 to 1. From
the applause bestowed at the conclusion
of the race, every member of the fair sex
on the grounds must have held a ticket on
him.
Going to the post equal favorite with
George Palmer, owner Pat Dunne s bay
colt Sten tor led the Spreckels entry from
start to finich, winning easily by half a
ieneth in 1:04^. Mercutio, a 200 to 1 shot,
took show honors.
Receding in the betting from 7to sto 9
to 5. the brown mare Candor led her field
in the second race over six furlongs until
below ttie paddock, where San Marco got
his head in front. Gardner on the latter
horse evidently thought he held the race
safe, and in hi* delirium of joy was nipped
out a nose by Braw Scot, who came fast on
the outside under T. Murphy's persuasive
riding.
The third event, at five and a hnlf fur
lones. looked a good thing for Pat Dunne's
Salvable, wbo was held at 1 to 2 over the
other four starter?. Alvarado, backed
down a point from 4 to 1, headed the lone
priced outsider, Tonino, in the stretch and
passed the wire over a lencth in front of
the first choice, who came from last
position.
The seven furlong run that followed was
run just about the way Midlo would have
ordered it could the ueidine have ex
perienced that pleasure. The field a;
lowed him to go out in the lead and open
up a gap of six lengths, and he was never
caught, finishing nearly two lengths
ahead of Strathroi, the second choice,
ridden by Willie Martin, who came from
back in the ruck. Imp. Miss Brummel,
the 11 to 10 choice, was runner up to the
stretch, where she began to tire, finally
landing just outside of the money, behind
Waifoca. The winner was 4 to 1 in the
books.
The fifth event on the card was a six
furlong sprint with â field of eight lining
up. It was gathered in by Caliente, the
7 to 10 favorite, who passed Alvero on the
far turn and fairly rolled in, reeling t tie
distance off m 1:165*. In a hard crive
young Spencer got Favory over the plate a
head in front of Alvero. Encino was a
bad fourth.
It looked as though the going would
about suit Scotch Rose with her reputed
bad feet and bet 97 pounds in the saddle,
but after leading until well on toward the
stand she succumbed rather easily to
Geyser, the third choice, ridden by H.
Martin. Sepoy was a distant third.
Notes.
The great California colt Crescendo will
in all likelihood never face the starter
again. In the early spring he pulled up
lame after winning a purse race at the old
Bay District track, and it was said he had
simply turned an ankle. Since that time

he has* been shelved. Yesterday John
Givins, who trains the big chestnut, said
that his coarge pulls up lame after nearly
all of his r gallops, ' and he fears that the

clip lie will break down hopelessly.
George Rose had but one of his field
books liana ting coin yesterday.
It is said that Pat Dunne did not go
Into over Willie Martin's ride on
Saivahle, and little is the wonder. Tak
ing a 1 to 2 favorite back to last position
behind a trio of "dogs 01 in a live-horse
race and then cutting loose in the stretch
and finishing second might be considered
good turf etiquette at Ideal Park or down
in the City ot Mexico, but is not relished
here, and Martin should have been se
verely censured by tne judges. After this
very pleasing exhibition of numskullery
Captain Kees should Le prevailed upon ' to
give Tommy Butler another chauce. â 
K. Â£. de B. Lopez will leave for England
next month in an endeavor to introduce

-Herman Hoffman, the St. Louis book
maker, will arrive here to-day. His crew
got in last night and are registered at one
of the downtown hotels.
Jack lliley, familiar to turf habitues on
â¢very racecourse in this country, is* in
town. As the publisher of "Jack's Tips"
he is renowned as having tipped some of
the longest priced winners of any handi
capper on the turf, including among them
a 500 to 1 snot..
Wade McLemore's Reel ..: was heavily
backed to get the show in the opening
event, but H. Martin took the Rocky
Mountain trail witn him and tue invari
able result followed. He finished sixth.
Golden, who finished third on the 200 to
1 shut Mercutio, was considered the 'â¢Gar
rison" of the Montana circuit and a very
clever rider. He has had but little oppor
tunity to display his efficiency in the sad
dle as yet.
It certainly looks like pressing the limit
just a trifle when a colt of Caliente's cali
oer is entered in a cheap selling affair to
be sold for $300." Oats will be higher later
on and the racing association will quit
winner in the end.
The string of Plunger George E. Smith
(Pittsburg Phil) will probably come to
California after ail. In a letter received 'â¢
by Charley Cook, the steeplechase rider,:

horses, states that Phil is going to start
for California shortly, and intends taking
his horses along. Fred Taral will accom

Frank Beard will send Nauki Pooh and
one or two others here in charge of Billy
Donahue. Mr. Crosby, -another Eastern

WHITEMAN GOES FREE.
All the Felony Charges Against Him
Have* Been Dismissed. -
Alonzo J. Whiteraan, ; wbo for years
figured as a prominent politician of Min
nesota, stood up in Judge Wallace's
court yesterday and asked that tbreo
charges of forgery and a charge of strain
ing money by false pretenses standing on
tne calendar against him be dismissed,
and his request was granted.
It seemed to be an understood case, for
the District Attorney made no-objection
and Whiteman had not taken the trouble
to cure the attendance of his lawyers, but
spoke (or himself.
Whiteman was accused, of having
forced the name ol a man named Diton
to several checks, which he passed on Sec
retary Maxwell of the Fireman's Fund In
surance Company. He was convicted and
sentenced to fourteen years in San Quen
tin. His caso was appealed and the Su
preme Court granted him a new trial on
the ground that it had not been proven
that such a man as Dixon existed or that
Whiteman had not obtained his permis
sion to sign ihe checks.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL^. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1896.
A POSTOFFICE CHANGE,
The OM Private Letter - Box
System May Soon Be
Abolished.
Much Larger L tter-Carrier Service
Will Bs Arranged â Sunday
Delivery.
First Assistant Postmaster - General
Jones in his animal report to the depart
ment suggested that the private posteffice
boxes be abolished. Assistant Post
master Doyle, in the San Francisco Post
office, stated yesterday that this is in the
line of improvements in the service that
is favored at Washington. In this City
the boxes rent for $3 a quarter.
The Postoilice authorities are very de
sirous of having all mail matter delivered
by the regular carriers. One objection is
that these boxes are too often used for
improper purposes. That is, women of
questionable character ana men who do
not want their correspondence delivered
at their homes or places of business re
sort to the private postoflice letter-boxes.
Criminals also frequently hire boxes in
the postoffice and carry on secret corre
spondence. There are several other ob
jectionable features.
There is also a desire to increase the
letter-carrier's service and have the money
spent in the rental of these boxes go to
the payment of men who will deliver the
mail matter free. This could be easily
done by increasing the appropriation of
the service.
If the wishes of the high officials are
carried out there will no doubt be a regu
lar delivery of mail on Sundays, while at
present the public is unable to secure its
letters until "Monday or go to the Post
office boxes. A few hotels secure a special
delivery of letters on Sunday.

FORGERY CHARGED.
Burt Miller Arrested for Signing His
Father's >;um> to Begging- Letter*.
Burt Miller, 18 years of agp, son of Wil
liam Miller, a butcher in this City and a
rancher at Napa, was booked at the City
Prison yesterday morning on two charges
of forpery by Detective Anthony and Ser
geant Blank.
Young Miller has been a source ot
trouble to his father for some years, and
about a year ago he was shipped to Aus
tralia. He returned about two months
ago and has been living at 1511 Golden
Gate avenue, where Sergeant Blank ar
rested him Sunday night.
Since his return he has been sending let
ters to some of his father's friends in this
City in which he forced his father's name,
asking them to advance money to him.
He succeeded in getting $20 from E. R.
Lilienthat, 100 Front street. M. D. Meyer,
grocer, Geary and Devisadero streets, was
also the recipient of one of-the letters, and
it is on these two charges that he is
booked.

JACOB H. NEFF, Chairman of the State Miners' Convention,
Which "Will Begin Its Session at Odd Fellows' Hall at JO â 
O'clock This Morning.
MINERS TO SIT
IN CONVENTION
Arrival of the Horny-
Handed From the Hills
and Canyons.
Reforms That Will Be De
manded in Aid of the
Industry.
A FEDERAL MINING BUREAU.
Request That the Miners Should Bs
Represented by a Secretary
in the Cabinet.
Miners arrived in this City on every
train yesterday to attend the miners' con
vention, which will open in Odd Fellows'
Hall at 2 o'clock this afternoon. The ses
sion bids fair to be one of the most inter
esting in the history of the association, for
the reason that somÂ«* important legisla
tion will be recommended for the benefit
of that industry.
Jacob H. Neff of Colfax, Placer County,
is one of the early arrivals. He has been
chairman of the convention for the past
four years, and he says he has had enough
honor and would be obliged if the conven
tion would allow him to retire on his well
earned laurels.
Mr. Neff said yesterday that the asso
ciation wanted to get the coal and iron
mine owners to co-operate with the gold
and silver miners for the purpose oi having
the industry represented at Washington
by a Secretary ai.d a Bureau of Mining,
just as the industry of agriculture is repre
sented. Mr. Neff could see no valid reason
why the same consideration which is ex
tended to the farmers should not be ex
tended to the miners.
The miners desire also to be represented
on the Board of Regents of the State Uni
versity. There are now in the university
a department on mining and a professor
of that industry, and it should be repre
sented on the board by a practical mining
man as regent. The convention will take
action with respect to some needed amend
ments to the mining laws relating to the
manner of obtaining patents to mineral
land*. Miners believe that the industry
is very much hampered by the difficulty
of establishing title, it often, under the
present law, Decoming necessary for the
miner to institute and maintain a lawsuit
at great expense in order to obtain title to
the land on which his claim may be
located.
Mr. Neff added that the hydraulic min
ers are very well satisfied with the opera
tion of the Caminetti mining act. The
course taken by the Debris Commission is
satisfactory to the miners, and no com
plaint has been heard from the farmers.
There aro some features of the law, how
ever, that work a hardship on the miner,
and which the association will try to do
away witn without encroaching on the
rights of the farmer.
In spite oi Mr. Neff's determination not
to be a candidate for chairman again
prominent members of the convention are
insisting that he should stand for re-elec
tion. Among available candidates men
tioned ore E. C. Loftus of Calaveras,
Charles P. Hoffman of Placer aad Harold
T. Power of Piacer.
Among the early arrivals of delegates
and visitors to the convention were:
Joseph M. Bovard and D. Boone of Angels

Mine, Placer County.

County, J. T. G"rove of MaTiposa, Charles
F. Hoffman and C. D. Lnne, at the Palace,
and Albert Moore of El Dorado and G. W.
Welch of Nevada at the Lick.
Charles V- Hoffman of the Red Point
mine in Placer County said the most
necessary legislation for the mining in
dustry was tbat which should insure a
perfect title to mineral land. If the rail
road companies were given a perfect titJe
for mineral lands the miners would just
as soon buy from the railroads as not, but
under the present conditions the pur
chasers from the railroad have to go into
court at their own expense and make a
fight to prove that the lands obtained by
them are of more value for raining than
for agriculture. This is an expense and
an annoyance which prospectors and la
borers are unwilling to bear.
The remedy for t;;is evil would be for a
Mining Commissioner to examine the
land and report upon its character, whether
mineral or agricultural, and take the
burden of litigation off the shoulders of
the miner.
"It used to be," added Mr. Hoffman,
"that the farmer had to prove that his
land was agricultural, but now the miner
has to prove that it contains mineral in
paving quantities. Tnis would be a very
difficult fact to establish, especially in
cases where the bed of the river is of a
lava formation, and where the gold is
deep under it. In fact, it would be im
possible to prove its mineral character
without going down very deep into it. j
These lava formations are very extensive
in Sierra, El Dorado and other counties.
"The bill to establish a National Mining
Commission fell through at the last ses- j
fion of Congress, but another attempt will !
be made in the coming session. The next j
thing most necessary is that we should !
have a representation in the Cabinet, in
other words a Secretary of the Bureau of
Mining.
"The appropriation by Coneress of
$250,000 and that by the State of $250,000
for the Durpose of building dams to re
strain mining debris have had a very good
effect toward solvinc the vexed question
of hydraulic mining. There are large
numbers of mines in California that can
be worked without any damage to tne
farmers, and the commissioners will do
their best to select them.
"The mining i-idustry is in a good posi
tion, and I expect that there will be con
siderable development during the next six
months with the aid of foreien and home
capital. New discoveries in science and
the invention of new and less expensive
processes for extracting the precious metal
from the ore are aiding lar-rely in the de
velopment of mining properties hitherto
considered as not of great value. By the
aid of these new processes $3 per ton ore
may be proritably worked, while the aver
i'.ge mine may be worked at a profit where
the yieid is $4 50 per ton or more.
'â Tlio mines of California have been only
j skimmed. The usual course was that
| when tne first chute of ore gave out the
| work was abandoned and richer prospects
were sought for. As an illustration of the
| cheapening of the processes I will say that
I I paid 26 cents for powder, which I now
I pet for 8 cenls, and candles that were
! worth 16 cents are now worth only B cents."
General Tolman of the Jackson mine,
| El Dorado County, was seen at the Palace
I Hotel. He is not a delegate to the con

industry and will attend the sessions
of the convention as an onlooker. Gen
eral Tolman is also interested In several
rich i.lacer claims in the bed of the Anipri
can River, between Sacramento and Fol
som.
He said he expected the coming year
would witness the inauguration of a great
development of the mines of this State.
Capital is beginning to come in and con
siderable investment is already noted.
Old mines that have been left untouched
for years are starting up again and much
new machinery is being put in.
He found that the low price of silver
has had a healthy effect in encouraging
investments in gold mines in California.
He knew that many mining men in Idaho
and Colorado are turning their attention
to gold mining in this State and are dis
posing of their silver mines, offering them
for sale at a reasonable rate since the elec
tion became known.
Formerly it was not profitable to work
gold ores that did not pay more than $18
or $.0 per ton, while at the present tune
$4 and $5 ore is considered profitable if
there be enough of it.
"My idea of the way to settle the hy
draulic mining proposition," continued
General Tolman, "was to allow every
man to mine as he formerly did and let
tie slickens go to the river as before, and
assess the hydraulic miners so much per
cubic yard to pay for the operation of
dredgers and sand pumps to keep the
river free, and to charge so much to the
owners of swamp lands for reclaiming it.
I do not believe in the permanency of
brush dams. In case of storms and
freshets the dams are liable to be washed
away and the brush will make the river
worse than it was before."
Albert Moore, a pioneer gold hunter of
forty-two years' experience in California,
came down from El Dorado County yes
terday to attend the convention as a spec
tator. He had found that under the pres
ent condition of things it was very diffi
cult for a prospector to buy a piece of
land on which he had made a discovery,
for as soou as the farmer who owned the
land discovered what it was wanted for he
put up the price 300 or 400 per cent.
Mr. Moore has discovered many valu
able telluride deposits in variou v p;\rts of
the State from San Diego to El Dorado
County.
G. W. Welch of Nevada City reported

LEROY G, HARVEY
MAY YET GO FREE,
Mrs. Smith Seems to Have
Abandoned the Pros
ecution.
She and Her Daughter Not
Present to Testily at
the Trial.
Leroy G. Harvey, the handsome and
aristocratic financier who is accused of rob
bing Mrs. Emily Smith of about $50,000,
bad a chance to escape through the meshes
of the law for lack of prosecution, as it is
believed that Mrs. Smith and her daugh
ter, Maude A. Smith, have intentionally
absented themselves from the State, in
order to keep from testifying in the case
against Harvey.
When the charge of grand larceny came !
on regularly for trial in Judge Bahrs' de
partment of the Superior Court yesterday
morning, the prosecution was surprised
to learn that none of the witnesses for the
State were present. In view of this state j
of affairs, Assistant District Attorney
Peixotto asked tor a continuance until fur
ther information could be obtained as to
the probable disposition of the case.
Judge Eahrs wanted to know why the
witnesses for the State were not present
in court, as they oupht to have been in
accordance with the understanding that
the case was to go to trial.
Mr. Peixotto explained that the District
Attorney's office, which he represented,
haa not been able to find the witnesses. He
understood that Mrs. Smith and her
daughter are in New York or some other
Eastern city.
On this showing the court granted a
continuance in order that the District At
torney's office may make another effort to
secure the attendance of these witnesses,
whose presence is essential to a success
ful prosecution.
At the time that Harvey's pilferings be
came Known he was indicted on two
charges, one of forgery and one of grand
I larceny. The charge ot forgery was tried
! first, and a conviction could not be se
cured for the reason that Mrs. Smith -aid
she had either signed or authorized
Harvey to sign ail the documents in dis
pute.
The trial judge at the time was under
stood to intimate that a mistake had been
made, and if the larceny charge had been
G. W. WELCH of Nevada City, a Well-Known
Mining Man Visiting the Convention.
JULIAN SONNTAG, Secretary of the State Miners' Convention
i pressed first there would have been almost
j a certainty of conviction.
It is thought that this view of the case,
I which was shared in by nearly all the
lawyers conversant with the case, caused
Harvey to fear the result of a second trial,
and that he has probably exerted himself
to placate the anzer of his victims to an
extent sufficient to secure an abandon
i ment of active prosecution on their part.
Atanyratp.^t is known that Mrs. Smith
and her daughter took a sudden depar
ture from this State and that none of
their friends have the remotest idea as to
when, if ever, they will return.
The fact that these ladies failed to
notify the District Attorney's office of
their intention to leave California and
their neglect to send information as to
their whereabouts, although they knew
that their presence was desired at this
time, lends color to the theory that they
have abandoned the idea of prosecuting
Harvey. Nor is this all. for a report was
current in Oakland yesterday that Attor
ney Guy Earl, who appeared as a special
prosecutor, representing the interest* of
Mrs. Smith and her daughter at the first
trial of Harvey, has let it be fcno-?vn that
he desires to have the prosecution
dropped.
It is not yet sure, however, that Har
vey s scheme will prove successful. At
the trial for forgery the fullest testimony
as to the stealing of the money and bonds I
belonging to Mrs. Smith was presented,
and it remains to this day substantially
undisputed. An effort will be made to in
troduce this testimony when Harvey's
trial is callea next week, and if the testi
mony is admitted it will be sufficient, at
torneys concede, to warrant a verdict of
gnilty.
Senator Earl, when seen last evening at
GENERAL TOLMAN of the Jackson Mine,
El Dorado County.
his residence, was not aware of what dis
nosition had been made of the case. "I
knew the case came up for action to-day,"
said he, "but dia not sse anything in the
papers about it. I have had no connec
tion with the criminal action whatever.
Mrs. Smith and daughter came to me
with Harvey's action and said they felt it
was their duty to place the facts in the
hands of the prosecutine officer. From
their statement of facts I told tiiem to go
ahead, and as a result four indictments
were returned asainst Le Roy G. Harvey,
two for embezzlement and two for lar
ceny, all being based on exactly the same
statement of facts.
"A couple of montlis ago the rirst em
bezzlement case was tried before Judge
Bahrs and a jury.
"Judge Bahrs ruled that the transfer of
'the stock involved passed the title to
Harvey and consequently he could not be
charged with embezzlement of property of
which the title was in him, and ordered
the jury to acquit, which they did. The
District Attorney then entered a nolle
pros in the other case. The larceny cases
are based on the exact statement of facts.
I would not be surprised if that official
had entered a nolle pros in these also,
under Judge Bahrs' ruling, believing he
could not secure a conviction. There has
been no restitution or attempt to settle
the matter out of court so far as lam
aware.
"The ladies are very averse to the no
toriety gained in the case and do not care
to go into court again if it is not possible
Lto secure a conviction. They have been
1 in San Jose for some time and are there
j now, I believe."
SUFFRAGE PLANS.
Getting Beady for a Legislative Cam
paign to Have the Issue
Resubmitted.
The new headquarters of the State
Woman's Suffrage Association will be at
room 569 in the Parrott building.
The association is engaged in moving
and probably will be settled anew some
timÂ» next week. While the present needs
of the association do not require the room
space that was indispensable during the
first campaign, headquarters will con
stantly be kept open. The move is only
to a few doors from the old location, being
on the same floor in the Parrott building.
The work to be prosecuted in the imme
diate future is the extension of club or
ganization. The activity which has char
acterized the movement up to date will
not be abated. On the contrary, the ladies
say that the first failure to carry the
movement through to success is not con
sidered to beaaeieat, for the large vote
polled was an evidence that the idea has
taken strong root.
The work now tends particularly to
ward getting some measure fairly under
way to be adopted by the Legislature if
that can be accomplished, the purpose of
the members of the association being to
have the issue again presented to the peo
ple as a constitutional amendment with
as little delay as possible.
Very likely Miss Mary G. Hay will be
back In California early next year, during
the session of the Legislature. This is
supposed to be a probability. She has
been strongly urged to return from the
East, for which she started Saturday at
toe same time that Susan B. Anthony
mid the other ladies connected with the
National organization departed.
It is well to know that if yon have a
watermelon on hand and no ice you may
still keep it cool by rolling it in wet cloths
and placing it in the sun. As the cloth
on the outside becomes dry keep wetting
it. The process of evaporation will cool
the melon.
CABLES TO GIVE

Several More Streetcar
Lines to Be Converted
Shortly.
The Work of Improvement to
Be Commenced After the
Holiday Season.
WAITING FOR BOHB SALES.
Powell, Sacramento, Jackson, Mont
gomery, Post and Howard Street
Lines to Be Changed.
Shortly after the holidays the work of
converting the cable streetcar lines now
operating on Post, Leavenworth, Howard,
Sacramento, Clay, Jackson and Powell
streets and the horsecar line on Mont
gomery street into electric lines will be
commenced. This news is announced on
the authority of Colonel Charles F.
Crocker, president of the Market-street
Railway Company, which controls all of
the lines mentioned.
Colonel Crocker was interviewed yester
day regarding the plan of construction
and improvement of the Southern Pacific
Company and the Market-street Railway
Company. It was known that some months
previous to the election he had gone East
and to Europe to arrange for the disposi
tion of bonds in order to secure funds for
carrying out certain new construction
work and extensive improvements, and
that owing to the silver agitation that was
then at its height in this country he was
unable to place any bonds on conditions
satisfactory to the interests he represents.
"We shall continue our present conserv
ative policy, 1 ' said Colonel Crocker, "so
far as the Southern Pacific is concerned.
We shall not undertake any new construc
tion work for a while â not at least until
the bond market is in condition to dispose
of bonds on satislactory terms. I have no
doubt that the result of the election will
bring this about now very soon. In the
meantime we shall only endeavor to han
die in iirst-class shape such business as
now comes to us.
"So lar as new streetcar lines are con
cerned," he continued, "there is no sec
tion of San Francisco to-day that is not
well supplied with transportation facili
ties, but we may improve some of the ex
isting lines by converting them into elec
tric roads. Among those that will be
changed into electric power roads are the
Montgomery, Post, Leavenworth, How
ard Sacramento. Clay, Jackson and Pow
ell street lines. And it is the intention of
the company to change the cable power
house on Washington and Mason streets
to an electric power station. But none of
this work will be commenced until after
the holidays. _
"We shall never maice the main lines
of t.'ie Market-street system into trolley
roads. If any change be made on them
they will be run by the very latest and
best methods, such at compressed air, as
Has already been announced in The Call.
"Another piece of improvement worfc
shortly to be taken up will be the replac
ing of the rails on the Market line from
Jones to Valencia street."
