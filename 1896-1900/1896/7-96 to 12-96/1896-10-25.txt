"VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 147.
MR. KNIGHT MADE
A GREAT SPEECH
, He Filled the Auditorium
With Delighted
People.
Democracy Accused of Being
Shifty and Without
Principle.
.'. TALK ON THE SILVER IBSTJE.
What the Republican Party Has Done
in the Interest of the Whole
Country.
George A. Knight did not need any bet
ter certificate of popularity than the crowd
which greeted him at the Auditorium last
night.
People blocked up the aisles and the
lobbies and filled the stage from the rear
wall to the footlights, and remained there
for two hours laughing ana applauding
to the graceful things, the witty things
and the other things that Mr. Knight said.
It was a warm audience and thoroughly
in accord with the sentiments expressed
â by the speaker.
His speech was of the fervid kind, with
passages here and there in beautifully
rounded periods that caugnt the applause
of the crowded building, and with here
and there a droll story that set them
laughing.
In his exordium he spoke of the dark
days of the Republic when "that home
ly, Jon^r, lean, God-fearing, good, lovable
man, Abraham Lincoln," took a piece of
â¢paper and wrote on it, "The United States
promises to pay the bearer at the city of
"Washington five dollars," and handed it
to the peopie. It didn't even say when it
would be paid, yet with the great big
heart of patriotism in the Nation that
â¢ paper was accepted by the volunteers who
followed the flap. They took this piece of
paper, which said that some time out of
. the darkness the Government might pay
that piece of paper.
Every time that a rebel bullet pierced
our flag gold went to a premium and the
greenback went down; every time that
the army of the Union met disaster on
the battlefield up went gold, and every
time the armies of the Union were suc
cessful gold went down and the green
back went up.
â¢ Mr. Knight next turned his attention to
the alleged Jove of the Democratic parly
ior the constitution, and went on to say.
"If you can find me ten Democrats
anywhere I will find you nine constitu
tional lawyers among them, and these
tobacco - shirtlront - stained, crooked
â¢ grained Democrats thought to cripple the
â¢army by starving it and they said it was
unconstitutional to print money on a
piece of paper. When Grant ran for
Presidentevery Democratic constitutional
lawyer in the country declared that the
issue of greenbacks was unconstitutional.
Then it wa? not long after that when they
argued that the greenbacks was lawful
money and that the National debt should
be paid in greenbacks, and from that
time on the Democratic party has been a
sort of political piece club, shifting from
one principle to another." - .
The Republican party, he added, has al
ways been in favor of internal improve
ments and a protective tariff.
The Democratic party has an idea now
. that South Carolina can do what she
pleases. She had a little difficulty with
the American flag some years ago, and she
is still true to her traditions, for she has a
man like Till man following the red flap,
or rather trying to follow it, for she has'nt
a corporal's guard to follow it.
The Democratic party never has been in
4 favor of protection to labor, argued Mr.
Knight. "Our fathers had to come here â
by the gods of war they had to come here
to live. They had a history and we re
member it. They brought no class dis
tinctions with them. There ought not to
be any distinction of class in this country.
The divine right of kings does not exist in
this country. We believe that all men are
created free and equal, and we propose to
live up to that belief." [Applause.]
In speaking of the high plane of Amer
ican civilization Mr. Knight said:
"You can't make a srood citizen unless
you couple him with a good wife, a good
Lome, a schoolhouse and an interest in it.
V When you enjoy the schoolhouse, the
church and the family circle, what in the
name of God do you want more? And
when you have that you have the founda
tions of a government that the earth-
quakes cannot shake."
The speaker bad the following to say on
the evils of pauper labor competition :
"You have across the water 400,000,000
of Chinese, with quick transportation, a
quick, imitative people, sober and indus
trious, who face us and who say, 'We will
fight you to a finish.' Among them are
men scientific in military research, schooled
in our colleges. To-night their messages
are going across the water ordering iron
ciads and torpedo-boats, and soon they
â¢ will be able to dictate to us if we let them
do so. Twelve dollars a year is good pay
fora Chinaman and $15 a year for a Jap
anese, and they can make anything from
a cambric needle to an ironclad war ves
sel.
"What's the remedy? Keep out all
-pauper labor and keep out all its products.
* "It has been Baid 'would it not be better
for them to manufacture their goods here
than in China because they will be forced
to spend some of their earnings here?'
No; it would be still better to keep them
out and their products altogether.
"IJI-paki labor is degrading and subver
sive of civilization. 111-paid labor is dt
gradiog to the laborer as well.
"Who ever heard of a woman wheeling
Â»-oai in a wheelbarrow in a coal mine for
W'> years and never seeing the light of the
%un? Who ever beard of a woman
chained to a dog and drawing water like
an animal? Nobody has seen that in
America, but it is a sight as common in
Europe as is the dust and cobbles in the
Btreets of San Francisco.
â¢ "Whenever you degrade womanhood,

you degrade civilization and subvert free
dom.
"Labor without capital is powerless;
capital without labor is a giant shorn of
his locks. Whoever undertakes to bring
about discord between cap tal and honest
toil is sticking nis dart into the heart of
the laborer.
"Who walks the floor at night worrying
whether he. will be able to pay his laborers
on Saturday night? It is the capitalist.
He has to face the Keen competition of
the present age. The man who gets up
at 6 o'clock in the morning and works all
day and goes to bed at night and sleeps
until morning is the true capitalist, for
there are some things that money cannot
buy.
"You go out to the park some morning
and see some old fellow with two teeth
and one spear of hair left riding a fast
trotting-horse because his doctor has told
him that if he does not take exercise he
will die. He is a millionaire, but all his
millions cannot buy a new lung or a new
liver or a new stomach or a new pair of
kidneys.
"What is money anyhow? It makes me
tired. Not money; oh, not money; be
cause I never get enough of it to make me
tired.
'â¢You hear some of those people talking
about gold as if it wore a plughat and
wouldn't speak to common folks, but when
it would meet Mr. Huntington would go
up to him and say: 'How are you, Collis?'
One would think that silver went around
the country in rags begginst for the price
of a square meal. Just as they speak of
wheat ana corn; wheat that is made into
nice white bread and cakes and pies,
while corn has got to go down and wallow
in the pigsty, or be made into whisky to
make Democrats drunk.
"There is no intrinsic value in any
metal that is dug out of the earth except
the labor it costs to produce. Gold is
stamped by the labor of the men who pro
duced it, and there never was a miner
who started at hunting for gold, and,
weary, disappointed and dying, lay down
and closed his eyes in everlasting sleep,
whose anguish and agony and tears and
death are not represented in the intrinsic
value of gold. You can't take an oiled
rag ana stamp it and call it a French din
ner. It won't go; it won't sustain
life. There isn't a free-silver-coinage
country in the world to-day whose
laborer wears shoes and stockings. Mex
ico did not monetize silver, but God de
monetized their men. It takes sixteen
Mexicans to make one American. No
Government in the world can stamp a
thing and make it worth something which
it was not.
"If I had $51,000 to-night what could I
buy with it? You can buy $51,000 worth
of silver bullion to-night just the same as
you can buy steeJ and copper and tin and
wheat and wool. You can't corner these
and they don't fight. Nothing fights
when it's cornered but a rat. Gold doesn't
fight when it's cornered."
The speaker recited an imaginary case
of farmers going East and to England with
wheat, wool and corn and coming back
with very little above expenses, while he
went to Washington with $51,000 worth of
silver bullion and had it coinei by the
Government under free coinage into $100,
--000, while the fools of farmers were trying
to sell their produce at a bare profit.
"Is that right? Is that fair? That will
be what will take place under the free
coinage of silver. That would be free
trade in silver bullion and in human labor,
and I do not believe in it.
"Do not undertake to stamp a He upon
any piece of coin in this country. The
Republican party has always been the
friend of silver. The Democratic party
never has been the friend of silver. Show
me the legislation that the Democratic
party has ever passed in favor of silver.
You cannot find it. AH you have is
promises, and who knows what those
promises amount to?"
Mr. Knight next paid his respects to the
shortcomings of the Democratic party
and said:
"When Cleveland was elected the
Democrato made a great hullabaloo
as to what would be accom
plished. Money was going into the
treasury and we were on Easy street,
and Cleveland, fat, corpulent and petu
lant, began to complain about the surplus
in the treasury, and wanted to reduce it
and his own surplus.
'Then Harrison was elected, a good,
pure statesman and business man, who
could fill any oifice from Coroner to Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court, but he was
not of that hail-fellow-well-met kind, or
'Hello, Jim, are you in; come-in-and-s*e
rce' sort, and he was not re-elected, but
Cleveland was. Then people began to
hide what they had, and they are hiding
it yet.
"What happened? For the first time in
the history of this Nation thousands of
starving men marched across the country
to Washington, and all the consolation
they got was 'Keep off the grass.' The
Democracy then proceeded to reduce the
surplus, and they did it with the Wilson
bill, which Cleveland didn't have the man
hood to veto or the courage to sign, and it
became a law without either."-
Mr. Knight next spoke of this same
party, with all its sins on its back, going
to Chicago and appealing to the people to
take them back.
"The Secretary of the Treasury of the
United States was rotten.egged the other
day while speaking in his own State. Was
that the American way to treat an officer
of this Government?"
Cries, of "No, no!" "Shame!" greeted
this announcement.
Mr. Knight spoke of Thomas V. flhtor's
recent declaration that if Bryan was not
elected he would appeal to arms and he
would be in the saddle. "Yes," continued
Mr. Knight, "he will be in the saddle in
Mexico."
This was illustrative of the character of
the men who are making Bryan's right.
The speaker then paid a tribute to Major
McKinley and said:
"For the past twenty-five years there
is no legislation bat what bears the ear
marks of the handiwork of William Mc-
Kinley. You may talk of the money of
Mark Hanna or the wealth of the million
aires, Dut money cannot mane brains; it
cannot give you history; it can't make a
man go back for thirty-five years and fight
the battles of his country. It cannot
insert its dirty slimy lingers into the
glorious record of the past and giye you
history that is not the truth.
"Major McKinley will be elected. The
only thins I would feel ashamed of would
be to have this State, with its need of pro
tection, to be misrepresented by Us vote.
You have honored me three times by
sending me back to represent this State in
National conventions, and I have always
felt it an honor. When the roll of Cali
fornia is called the whole convention
looks forward to see how California is
going to vote. We voted for McKinley in
St. Louis. Then this mushroom party
comi's up. We became drunk with our
power, and some of us thought there
nnght be something in a new party, but
to-day they are dropping the lead-line in
their judgment and finding how this 16 to
1 system will not be a good thing for the
country.
"Next March some of you will be in-
Washingtoh and you'll feel like a sheep
killing dog when they ask you why Cali
fornia wont off wrong in the election
when you need protection so much.

CANTON, Omo, Oct. 24.â Delegations
came to-day with a good deal of regular
ity from sunrise to sunset. Major Mc-
Kinley was employed in speaking to
throngs or in greeting smaller groups of
visitors from 8 o'clock in the morning till
late this evening. It was after 6 o'clock
when the lastgreatdelegation, 2000 railway
men, from St. Louis and East St. Louis,
marched shouting and cheering down the
hill from the McKinley house. Enthusi
asm arose to its most intense pitch to-day,
and Major McKin ley's speeches seemed- to
move the throngs which came to hear
more deeply than ever. There were
nearly 14,000 visitors.
Upward of twenty-five delegations called
formally upon Major McKinley and he
made twelve speeches. Railway men
came in great numbers, and their enthusi
asm was unbounded. The wooden fences
about the house were torn down and car
ried away by relic-hunters, and all the
smaller trees and shrubs in the yard were
cut down close to the ground and con
verted into souvenirs of the Presidential
campaign of 1896 in Canton. Men almost
came to blows in the eagerness of their de
sire to get near enough to Major McKinley
to touch his garments. The visitors to
Canton are becoming more demonstrative
as the day of election approaches..
Major McKinley was in excellent health
to-day and spoke with his usual vigor.
His speeches, with lew exceptions, were
short and of the impromptu order. He
has had a day of uncommon activity and
seems to have enjoyed it. He said tc
night that he thought his heaviest work
fn this campaign had b?en done. There
are delegations every day next week, and
some important ones are expected, but
not more than half a dozen scheduled for
a single day. The executive commtttee of
the Railroad Men's League of Boston is
expected here on Monday to call on Major
McKinley.
Pennsylvania sent the first delegation
that greeted the candidate. At 9 o'clock
a party of 400 marched up the bill to the
McKinley residence. It was composed of
representatives of Berks, Chester, Schuyl
kiil ana Montgomery counties, Pennsyl
vania. Reading and Lebanon were the
principal towns represented. Ex-Mayor
J. R. Kenny of Reading, for the third time
during the campaign, spoke for the Read
ing and Berks County visitors, while the
pilgrims from the other counties were in
troduced by J. Victor Smith of Lebanon.
Many former Democrats, the speaker de
clared, were among the visitors, and they
were enthusiastic for sound money and
protection.
Pennsylvania was closely pressed by
Illinois. The Lumber Exchange and
Builders' and Traders' Exchange of
Chicago, were represented by over 1400
delegates in the party that gathered about
the McKinley porch this morning. The
members of this delegation were particu
larly demonstrative and<greeted the can
didate with three rousing cheers and a
tiger as he appeared before them. For
this delegation Harvey S. Hayden of
Chicago acted as spokesman. He pre
dicted that Chicago would give McKinley
the largest majority of any city in the
United Stales. Among other things he
said:
"Ink is very dry on many contracts for
improvements in Chicago. It is dryer
where it says, 'In case of the election of
McKinley this contract is in force; if he
is ile fea ted it shall be canceled,' and on
others, 'If sound money wins.' Millions
of dollars are tied up in Chicago, waiting
an opportunity to vote for sound money."
The third delegation was from Steuben
and Chemung counties, New York. It
numbered about 800 voters, mostly farm
ers and glass-workers. With the New
York visitors was a small delegation from
McKane County, Pn. W. W. Clark of
Wayland addressed Major McKinley in
behalf of the New York delegation. He
said the counties of the "southern tier"
were practically solid for McKinley and
hat they would give a largely increased
vote to the Republican ticket. Mr. Clark's
speech Â»vas a model of brevity. Ex-Con
gressman W. W. Brown spoke for the
Pennsylvania people.
Major McKinley was greeted with three
times three cheers wten he ' stepped for
ward to speak.
A splendid delegation of 600 railroad
men from Kansas and Missouri called at
12 o'clock. They had been on the cars for
more than twenty-four hours. The dele
gation came with a band and many ban
ners. Some of the inscriptions were as
Joliows : "Kansas is right in line for sound
money and Republicanism," "No Popo
crat need apply for the job of running the
Sunflower State."
The delegation was composed of em
ployes of the Chicngo, Rock Island and
Pacific Railroad. No more enthusiastic
body of men has visited Canton.
T. J. Anderson of Topeka spoke for the
Kansas members of the delegation. He
was very happy in his remarks. He said:
"We have been coerced, every man of us;
coerced' by our employers to Buch an ex
tent that nothing short of a mandamus of
the United States Supreme Court would
have kept us at home." This sally was
greeted with cheers and laughter. C. J.
Ringe spoke for the Missouri people.
While Major McKinley was addressing
the railway men from the West a delega
tion of 400 men employed in the steel and
tin mills of Cambridge, Ohio, marched
into the yard. J. H. Morgan introduced
the steel- workers and Ambrose Beard the
tinniill employes. Major McKinley ad
dressed them briefly, discussing the tariff
and the money question. The next dele
gation was composed of colored voters of
Pittsburg.
A hundred school teachers from towns
in Northeastern Ohio then put in an ap
pearence.
Pennsylvania railroad employes to the
number of 1000 of Creston and Mansfield
marched in a body to Major McKinley'a
house at 2 o'clock.
Major McKinley made his ninth speech
to a delegation composed wholly of young
women stenographers in the employ of the
Goodrich Company of Akron. The visit- ,
ors were introduced by Miss Lydia Car
baugh. Major McKinley addressed the
delegation with great earnestness and was
frequently applauded. After listening to
j his speech the visitors were introduced to
Mrs. McKin ley, to whom they presented
large clusters of yellow chrysanthemums.
A delegation of 800 farmers and oil-pro
ducers from the counties of Allen, Henry
and Anglaine, Ohio, then came along.
A large and spirited delegation from
Cleveland, numbering more than 2000,
called on Major McKinley at 4:30 o'clock.
They came with a gleecluband with many
flags, bands and banners. In the delega
tion was the British Isles Association of
j Cleveland, the employes of the Standard
Tool Company and of the Standard
Machine Company. There were several
speeches, and the sun went down before
Major McKinley addressed the great dele
gation. The spokesmen were Colonel
William A. Monahan for the Irish mem
bers of the British Islrs Association, D. W.
Johns for the Welsh, Captain George Wer
ner for the English, W. W. Creer for the
Manxmen, William Downey for the Scotch,
W. H. Pirong for the Standard Tool Com
pany, W. C. Talmage for the Standard
Machine Company.
The most demonstrative delegation of
the day and one of the largest, came from
Missouri and Southern Illinois. It was
I composed in the main of the railway
I men's sound-money clubs of St. Louis and
i East St. Louis. At no time in the cam
! paign has Major McKinley received a more
enthusiastic greeting than that given him
just after sunspt to-night by the railway
i men. There Wfl c 2000 of them, and their

flaywards was en fete to-day. Had the
aeronaut who ascended this afternoon
made his skyward trip this morning he
would have been forced to the conclusion
that all roads lead to Uaywards. As
early as 7 o'clock the wagons commenced
to arrive witn the farmers and their
families from the surrounding country,
all intent on enjoying to satiety the food
for body and mind so liberally provided
at the big Republican barbecue.
There were free beef, free clams, free
coffee, free potatoes, free campaign liter
ature and, to sum up, everything was
free, including the r>ght of free speech.
To the man whose mind was free there
were several free object lessons. One of
the most prominent perhaps was a little
scene that was witnessed at the entrance
to the barbecue arena. There were scores
of farmers' carts and wagons Jined up.
They all showed wear and tear and some
were just able to hang together with the
aid of numerous wire wrappings and oc
casionally the liberal use of a hay band.
The farmer's jeans were worn and his
wife and children did not look as though
they would have objected to a replenish
ing of their wardrobes. But it was the
best showing they could make. As the
band was playing "Marching Through
Georgia" a substantial wagon passed
where the farmers' rigs were hitched. The
wagon was well built, the harness was in
good order, the horses appeared to be well
fed, as they hauled a big load of produce
to market. Seated on the front and back
were four fat, sleek, very contented China
men, and as they criticized the proces
sion, in their own language, it would have
been interesting to have heard what thoso
Celestials, who can live on 5 cents a day
and grow rich, thoueht of people who
laugh at the necessity of American pro
tection and who regard the matter of un
restricted immigration as inferior to tnat
of a nap-hazard experiment in finance.
Several of those farmers "took in" that
Chinese wagon and doubtless thought of
it for hours later when General Barnes
was letting drop a few truths from the
platform.
Several trainloads of people went from
Oakland, and special electric trains carried
out the Army and Navy Republican
League and the Woman's Republican
Club. They were met by a brass band
and escorted to the scene of the fiesta.
Etiquette, so called, was dispensed with,
and, as becomes a great Republican gath
ering, all met on the same level. Con
gressman Hilborn had to hold up his
paper plate to the servers of the smoking
beeve that was just lifted from the pit,
and had to take his chance with the Oak
land gamin, and he didn't get any the
better of the gamin either. Only in one

instance was that rule broken, and that
was when a young lady was so overcome
with admiration for General Barnes that
Bhe rushed off and brought him a coffee
cup, thinking presumably that the tin
cup, of which there were thousands on
the grounds, might be a little too plebeian
for her idol.
The people who. banned the barbecue
were practical. They bad gauged the
Aiameda County appetite accurately.
Never in tho history of Haywards has so
much food been consumed within the

cold air v oi a somewhat clouded October
day supplied the sharp appetite that
added a finishing zest to the feast.
A few thousand people standing, sitting,
lolling against trees or leaning over fences,
holding plates in one hand and navigat
ing its am pie contents to their mouths
with the othe: ; several score of willing
maids and men handing over rough lum
ber tables delicious morsels without end;
come swarthy Mexicans carving huge
beeves spitted over a large greasÂ« fire in a
pit; everybody enjoyiuc themselves and
far moie interested in promoting general
bonhomie than in abstruse political prob
lems, and such in brief was to-day's bar
becue.
The veterans wearing large red badges
were the most conspicuous of all. They
seemed to be quite at home with their tin
spoons and tin pannikin?, and the absence
of knives and forks and napkins and fin
per-bowls did not trouble them in the
slightest. As t!i"y stood around eating
beef with their fingers they recalled the
lime when they ate in the open air a gener
ation tgo, when their wives and sweet
hearts would have had as hard a task to
find a gray hair then as a purely ebon one
to-day.
President of the day, George S. Lan
pan, opsnpd the proceedings by announc
ing that Hay wards capitulated for the aay
to her visitors, and auvising them to take
the fullest advantage of their opportunity,
which they conscientiously proceeded to
do.
Larpe as was the crowd, it would have
been much larger hari the weather civen
earlier indication that there would be no
rain during the day. The clouds huns
low all morning and once c twice a little
mist fell, but not sufficient to save the road
sprinklers a trip. Soon after President
Lnngon had formally welcomed the guests
he acain ascended the *tand anti an
nounced that two and a half tons of crapes
had been driven on to the ground and were
like the clams and oth.-r good things â ab
solutely free.
A marked feature of the large gachering
was t:.e large number of ladies. There
was a strong contrast between their fresh,
ruddy laces and the features made pallid
bj- electric lights that is seen at a ciiy
gathering. It was to a larse extent a
country gathering, and as nearly every
body was acquainted with everybody else
there was no formality of stiffness, and
one idea, that of having a good time, pre
vailed. Prominenc among tae pleasure
seekers were two Salvation Aray lassies
seeking to earn a premium by being cham
pion War Cry sellers, and even they did
not seem out of place.
The grand stand was encircled with
American flags, and around the platform
were pictures having a bearing on the po
litical situation, and which were Â»s good
as a puzzle-book to the younger portion of
the crowd.
About 2 o'clock President Langan called
the vast assemblage to order, and the fol
lowing vice-presidents occupied seats on
the platform: Captain William Roberts,
Henry Smyth and H. W. Meek. San Loren
zo; J. H. Strobridge, D. S. Smailey, C.
Wintonand John Webster, Haywards; L.

Judge Greene made a little speech and
told what he would do if re-elected. Sam
P. Hall, who is the running mate of
Judge Greene for the Superior bench, said
a few words and paid a tribute to' the
value of brevity.
J. W. Clark, in whose Assembly district
Haywarda is situated, delivered a short
speech regarding the value of electing a
solid, intelligent Republican Legislature,
and was certain that the Creator never
intended that such a productive district
should return a mongrel Assemblyman.
Congressman Hilborn was loudly
cheered, and, having stated he accepted
the chetring as- proof that his course in
Congress was not altogether distasteful to
his constituency, he promised to follow
along the same line, and bowed himself to
his seat.
H. A. Powell told a few Republican
truths and gave some advice worth follow
ing.
D. E. McKinlay, the Santa Rosa candi
date on the Republican electoral ticket,
was in fine form and made a telling
speech. As in his iormer speech at the
Tabernacle he poured forth a volume of
facts that were unanswerable and con
â¢vincinj;. He carried his audience with
him, and his practical speech, coming as
it did from a man who is proud that he is
a Knight of Labor.it created a deep im
pression and left many of his audience
thinking as they had never thought be
fore.
Mrs. Holbrook Blinn was the next
speaker and she confined her remarks
soieiy io the justness and legitimacy of
giving the right of suffrage to her sex.
Mrs. Blinn was honored as were none of
the other speakers. The sky had worn a
threatening aspect all the day, but before
Mrs. Blinn had spoken a couple of sen
tences the clouds buret wide open and the
scene of life and gayety was bathed in
sunshine for several minutes. The ladies
at once called attention to the happy omen
and prophesied success to the cause with
more confidence than ever.
General W. H. L. Barnes was the next
and last speaker. He said he felt at home
as be iiad not done lor years. He saw
around him farmers and ladies, and work
ingmen and politicians and they were ail
men and women who were able to think
and act for themselves. Thegeneral made
a forcible speech, but was interrupted
twice.
While referring to the windy promises
of the allied parties there was a rush as of
a sudden gust of wind and the immense
balloon that had been inflated on the
ground was seen shooting upward. The
vast audience and the speaker watched
the assent with great interest and not till
the aeronaut had safely landed on a neigh
borhood hillside from his parachute was
the speaking resumed. General Barnes
had not proceeded far before there was an
other interruption.
There is a man who lives at Haywards
named Toyneâ George E. Toyn. He is an
Englishman, whom the new great register
shows to have been naturalized jusf two
years ago. For three months Mr. Toyne
nas become convinced that it is his mis
sion on earth to reorganize the monetary
Bystom of the world in general and
of America in pariicula*. He has two
claims to distinction.
Lust Fourth or July Â«*e read the
Declaration of Independence at Hay
wards at a Populist gathering o f
twenty-two Populists at the club
house park, and he has written a pam
phlet, in grr.mmer of varied merit,
regarding the siiver question. He was at
the barbecue to-day, ami when the
speaker uttered some good American
truths Mr. Toyne could not understand
them, so he at once concluded that Mr.
Barnes was wrong.
"'Ow about 16 to 1?" shouted Tovne.
'â¢What does tho gentleman say ?" asked
the speaker.
"Hi warnt to know wot's the matter
with 16 to 1?" repeated Toyne.
"Nothing is wrong with it,'' was the re
ply, "so long as it is 1(5 to 1, but when you
try to m:ike something else that is not 1G
cyual to 1, then it is all wrong."
GEORGE A. KNIGHT Pouring Hot Shot Into the Democracy in His Speech in the
Auditorium Last Night.
"Aw," said Toyne. "Then why cawn't
the Government hissue paper money ?'
"It can, so long as it has the money to
redeem it with," said the speaker, "and
so can you."
"No, I [cawnt," said Toyne; and when
the speaker agreed with him the crowd
saw the point and cheered and yelled for
several minutes. Poor Toyne'a accent
was not in his favor, and after he said
something about liking a fair "nar^u
rr-eiit" he went for tue third time to the
shambles and devoured some more free
American beef, while the speaker finished
his address.
Hay wards had two motives for giving
the barbecue, and each operated to stimu
late the other and guarantee a successful
fiesta. One motive was to give the cause
of Republicanism a boost in a vicinity
that usually favors the enemy, the other
was to demonstrate that Haywards is the
natural center of what will be the new
county when Aiameda County is divided.
Both purposes were served, and the people
ot the town, of all political faiths, are con
gratulating themselves to-night that they
stood hand in hand to play the part of
host to the rest of the county. They
scored a porfect success, and Haywards
added a fresh ciiaplet to her honors as an
entertainer. The day's festivities closed
to-night with a grand ball given by the
Native Sons.
MR. KNIGHT MADE
A GREAT SPEECH,

CHICAGO. 111., Oct. 24.â Chairmen of
Republican State committees throughout
the country are sending letters to tha
chairmen of county and city committees
and clubs by order of the National Com
mittee, urging them to get out the vote
ejection day before noon, in order to tabu
late an estimate of votes cast at that time
from the registration books and report to
the State headquarters the outlook, com
paring the number voted with the regis

The object is to give the afternoon to
Republicans who nave voted for active
missionary work at the polls in the way
of bringing out a full vote and securing
the attendance of voters who are invalids
and those who may be detained from the
polls by business. It is believed that in
this manner the result of the election will
be anticipated and reported to National
Committee healquarters in Chicago
shortly afte^sunset.

Money bit Republican*.
ST. LOUIS. Mo , Oct. 24.â State Chair
man Ruselle of the People's party charges
that tour limes since the nomination of
the Populist ticket ha has been offered
money from Republican sources to use his
influence toward keeping a full third party
ticket in the field. In an interview to-day
Mr. Roselle is quoted as saying:
"Mr. Jones (nominee for Governor) has
suffered enough abase and vile insinua
tions because of his withdrawal from the
contest for Governor. It is time the truth
should be told. Money has been offered
the Populist candidates and the commit
tee repeatedly during the campaign from
Republican sources. If any Populist has
fallen into treachery or has been influenced
to act by money it has been by Republican I
money. Not one dollar, not a p.ed;e of
Office has been made by Democrats.
"Republican money was offered me, and
not only me, but Mr. Jones, to oppose
electoral fusion with the Democrats and
to keep the State ticket intact, " he said.
"Republican money was offered others of
the Populists also, and I have dot the
slightest hesitation now In saying that
some ol it was accepted."
After refusing three offers, Chairman j
Roselle says the alleged representatives of
Chairman Filley of the Republican State
Committee made another proposition to
him in the following language: "'The
moment you file your whole State ticket
at Jefferson City,' he said, 'tne "old man"
(meaning Filley), will produce for you
$1000, and I am authorized to say that you
can have $1000 more on which to make a
red hot straight campaign.'
"This man even went so far as to pro
duce checks in my presence. My patience
> became exhausted, and I sa ; d just this,"
continued Mr. Roselle. " 'You must go
back to Filley and tell him for me to goto
hell. I will not say one word or move one
finger to influence the Populist State Com
mittee to aid a goldbug for any office from
governor to constable. 1 "
Mr. Roselle says he was also offered
$1000 for his influence in keeping Judge
North out of the race for Attorney-Gen
eral.
Chairman Filley of the Republican State
Committee was asked in reenrd to the
charges of bribery al stated by Mr. Roselle
and said: "The whole thing is a barefaced
lie. I had no such representative. I don't
do business in that illegal way. But I
would not be surprised if a certain Populist
had some Republican money, if some of
his close friends do not misrepresent him.
That is all the answer I have to make."

POISONED WITH STRYCHNINE
An Insane Servant Girl Causes the Death

KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 24.â As a re
sult of Rtiychnine poisoning two little
girls, aged 4 and 10 years, children of
Charles Mussey of 2411 Forest avenue, are
now d,ead and suspicion of murder rests
upon a servant, Alice Platt, who is now in

Yesterday afternoon the children were
given cookies by the servant and about 5
o'clock were stricken with convulsions
and the younger child died before medical
aid reached her. This morning the older
child died. Five weeks ago Mrs. Mussey's

QUINCY, 111., Oct. 24.â This has been
a lazy, meander ng day of campaigning
for William J. Bryan. It is true he has
traveled 300 miles through his native
State and spoke more than a dozen times )
but comparison with his recent work
makes the adjectives used applicable. He
began at Ottawa in the morning, made
some speeches in the Spring Valley coal
region, shot over the Mississippi at Rock
Island, and after making a wide detour by
way of Monmouth, Macomb and Bushnell
went back to the Mississippi, concluding
the day at Quincy. Late to-night he left
for Jacksonville, the town where Mr. and
Mrs. Bryan attended school and were
married, to remain there until Monday
afternoon.
The interview with Bishop Worthing
ton, which contained some decided refer
ences to the iree-siiver agitation and the
education of the childjen of farmers, was
read carefully by Mr. Bryan to-day, and
he made a response to the Bishop's state
ments in his speech at Monmouth this
evening.
Mr. Bryan also took occasion to say
something at La Salle about the criticisms
passed by General Benjamin Harrison and
President Ingalls of the Big Four in his
advice to laboring men concerning their
right to vote. With Vice- President Ste
venson seated near him on the stand from
which he spoke in a joint meeting held
lor the benefit of Rock Island and its sis
ter town of Moline, Mr. Bryan made a
curt reference to President Cleveland and
gave in other speeches indications that
the closing days of the campaign will not
be nevoid of warmth. Large crowds were
apain the order to-day. Quincy, Rock
Island, Moline and Monmouth furnished
the largest cuirHences. That at Monmouth
was particularly enluusiastic and showed
considerable warmth. Several places not
on the railroad schedule of the candidate's
special turned out good-sized assem
blages.
At one of these, Galva, some men in the
crowd shouted questions at Mr. Bryan and
then would not let him answer, and for a
minute or two a spirited repartoe between
nominee and audience was kept up. The
I 6000 people at Bushnell went fairly crazy
I over Mr. Bryan and literally overwhelmed
him in his progress from stand to train on
the cone.usion of his speech. The places
where Mr. Bryun made miuresses during
the day are Ottawa, La Saile, Spring Val
ley, Laud, Bura, Kewanee, Rock I3:and,
Uoline, Alpha, Alex:s, Monmoutb, Bush
nell, Macomb and Quincy.
KEWANEE, 111., Oct. 24.â Mr. Bryan
began speechmaking this morning oetore
he had eaten breakiast. His first appear
ance was at Ottawa, where he addr/ssed
4000 people at haif-past 8 o'clock. At La
Salle he made another speech before 10
o'clock to an audience of about 1500.
Spring Valley turned out a crowd of luOO.
including many miners, to whom Mr.
Bryan spoke briefly. He also addressed
crowds of several hundreds at Ladd and
Bura. In his speech ut La Salle Mr.
Brvan replied to tna criticisms by ex-
President Harrison and President Ingalls
of the Big Four roads of his advice to rail
road men about casting their ballots. He
said:
Ladies and Gentlemen : There Is a matter to
which I ask your attention for a moment.
Two distinguished men have called me to ac
count because oi advice wnich I gave to rail
road employ es. In spt-aking of the attempt of
the railroads to coerce their employes 1 said
that in these hard times, when employment is
sod.fflcult to find, I did not want to advise
laboring men to do anythmc which would
Use them their employment, and added that
they should wear Republican buttons if neces
sary, march in Republican parades if they
were commanded to do so, and even con
tribute to the Republican campaign fund If
that was required by their employers, but
that they should vote according to tueir con
victions on election day.
Mr. Ingalls, the president of a railroad, in a
speech at Cincinnati, denounced me for advis
ing employes to deceive their employers and
ox-President Harrison has etiarged me with
teaching immorality in giving the advice
which I have quoted. Now, I desire to justify
my position. The right to vote according
to one's conscience is a law given
right. Coercion is a violation of the law,
and when I advise employes to vote as
they please, even though tney must wear Re
publican buttons and march iv Republican
parades, I am taking high moral grounds and
giving morn patriotic advice than those who
countenance coercion and appeal to employes
to vote the Republican ticket on election day,
merely Decause they have been compelled to
wear Republican badges during the campaign.
ROCK ISLAND, 111., Oct. 24.â Four or
five tnousand people, including large
numbers of farmers and their families,
drove m from the surrounding country
and beard Mr. Bryan on the fair grounds
at Kewanee at noon. In his speech Mr.
Bryan said:
We have had 16 to 1 exemplified and illus
tratod in various ways as we have passed from
place to place. Sometimes we have been
greeted by sixteen little girls dressed in white
and one little girl dressed in yellow; some
times a carriage has been pulled by sixteen
white horses and one yellow horse, and in a
number of places we have received flowers
where the bouquet has been composed of six
teen white flowers and one yellow one, but!
understand that in this couutry you have the
16 to 1 ratio represented in a much more prac
tical and effective way than we aave found it
represeuted anywhere else.
You have one family in this county with
sixteen persons who have heretofore voted the
Republican ticket, all oi whom will vote for
free silver this year at 16 to 1 [cheers], and
when the family has been Republican before,
wby it counts, you know, at tho bullion ratio,
because when we have a vote from the other
side it counts two, so in thi3 family it really
means the bullion ratio of 31 to 1. [Great
cheering.] Now, I am not surprised that
people who have been Republicans all their
fives are this year" deserting the Republican
party because the Republican party haa taken
& new position.

that their party has left them, but the Demo
crats who go from us to the .Republican on the
money question have to desert the history of
thd Democratic party, because our party has
stood for bimetallism, for the use ot gold and
silver os standard money, during all its exist
ence, I say. therefore, that when a Republi
can comes to us he still has convictions that
he used to have. When a Democrat leaves us
he lias got to change his convictions and go
over a:id denounce what he used to love aod
love what he used to hate.
The most persistent attempt made dnr
ing Mr. Bryan's tour to create a demon
stration against him occurred at a little
place called Galva, where the train halted
a few minutes just after leaving Kewanee.
About 200 people were there. They were
fresh from imbibing Republican doctrine
administered by the five ex-Governors of
Illinois, vrho are traveling through the
State with John R. Tanner. The Tanner
special train, with a flatcnr containing a
cannon, had passed Mr. Bryan's special
earlier in the day. A salute was fared and
the governors deluged the Bryan train
with Republican literature as they dashed
by. Cheers for McKinley were given as
Mr. Bryan stepped out to greet a gather
ing at Galva, and the candidate responded
with: "Is there anvbody here who thinks
that the gold standard is the best thing?
Cries of -Yes" and "No" followed.
Mr. Bryan repeated bis question and
got an immediate answer from an elderly
man who was very much excited and
shouted at the top of his voice: "We have
coined twice as much silver since the de
monetization act as there ever was from
the time of Jefferson to '73," he shouted,
and the crowd cheered.
"How much silver are we coiningnow?
demanded the candidate. There was no
response and he went on: "I want those
who say that gold is a good thing to hold
up some gold," he said, "hold up your
gold, iorae of you." Jur-t tuen the train
Wan to move and Mr. Bryan called back:
'My friends leok out for the gold man
vithout any coid."
The crowd cheered, but whether for Mc-
Kinley or Bryan was not evident.
MONMOUTH, 111., Oct. 24.â The twin
cities of Moline and Rock Island, with the
assistance of many people from Daven
port, just across tne Mississippi in lowa,
heid a joint celebration of William J.
Bryan's coming this afiernoon. Speeches
had been made at all these places by Mr.
Bryan on his trip from Lincoln to New
York in August, "but evidently there had
been :o cessation of interest in the Demo
cratic candidate, for at least 20,000 people
gathered to hear him at a point midway
between Moline and Rock Island. Vice-
President Stevenson was also present and
made a short speech when Mr. Bryan had
concluded.
The vice-president went aboard the
Bryan special after the meeting and ac
companied the Presidential candidate to
Quiucy. Although Alpha and Alexis were
not scheduled for stops the train halted
at both places to enable Mr. Bryan to ad
dress good sized crowds. About 2000 peo
ple were at Alexis and Mr. Bryan told
them that he ielt an interest in the town
because it was the home of his law part
ner. If his law partner had not persuaded
him to go to Lincoln, he said, he would
not have been elected to Congress, and if
he had not been elected to Congress he
would not have become a Presidential
candidate. At Macomb Mr. Bryan spoke
as follows :
Ladies and gentlemen: I want to call your
attention to an interview which r.ppears in
yesterday morning's Chicago Chronicle. I
hope that we may find out that it is not true.
I waited until to-day before using it, thinking
that possibly the morning s r a per might make
a correction, and when I speak of it I want you
to distinctly understand that if there be a sub
sequent denial of the language used, then all
I siiall say about It shall lall to the ground.
It is an interview published in the Chronicle
of Cnicaxo of yesterday morning and a dis
patch from New York giving the interview
with Bishop Wcrthington ot Omaha. Let me
read you what he says: "When it was sug
gested to the Bishop that the larmers through
out the country were not In tis prosperous
condition as tney had been in the past, Bishop
Worthington said:
"The trouble with the farmer, in my judg
ment, is that we have carried our free educa
tional system entirely too far. The farmers'
sons, a great many of them who have abso
lutely no ability to rise, gee a taste of educa
tion 'and follow it up. They will never amount
to anything â that is, many of themâ and they
become dissatisfied to follow in the walk of
life that God intended they should and driit
into cities. It is the overeducatlon of thoss

Mr. Bryan arrived at Quincy on his
special traia at 8:30 o'clock, accompanied
by Vice-President Stevenson. Big excur
sions came from points in Illinois and
Missouri and helped swell the thousands
of residents wlio turned oat to see the
parade and hear the speaking. Three
speeches were made by Mr. Bryan, the
first at Courtnouse square, where au im
mense ithrong was congregated. He was
heartily cheered. The beautiful Wash
ington square was the scene of the next
demonstration, and then Mr. Bryan went
to the Empire Theater. He brought out
no new features in his several speeches.

THE TOUB OF THE SECRETARY,
At Bowling Green H? Takes Occasion
to Talk About the Rights of
Free Speech.
COVINGTON, Kt., Oct. 24.â A. sub
scription was started by the Newport
Commercial Club to-day to secure the
best private detective talent and attorneys
for the purpose of ferreting out and bring
ing to punishment the perpetrators ol tho
insult to Secretary Carlisle.
This evening the Commercial Club of
Covington issued a call for a meeting of
citizens, irrespective of politics, for Mon
day evening, to repudiate the outrages and
insults offered to Mr. Carlisle, and to de
mand of the Maror and city officials the
prompt arrest and punishment; of the
offenders.
On Secretary Carlisle's return the club
will give nim a reception and banquet.
BOWLING GitEEN, Kt., Oct. 24. âHon.
John G. Carlisle, Secretary of the Treas
ury, spoke here this afternoon, to an audi
ence which overflowed the opera-house.
Mr. Carlisle arrived at Bowling Green
early this morning, and was kept busy all
day shaking hands with callers.
The scene in the opera-house was en
tirely different to that at Covington. No
attempt was made to interrupt Mr. Car
lisle, beyond a few shouts for Bryan and
Mr. Rhea, the Third District nominee for
Congress. There were many women in
the audience and they showered flowers
on the distinguished Secretary.
Mr. Carlisle spoke for one hour and
twenty-five minutes. Immediately after
Mr. Carlisle finished speaking John Khea,
the free-silver Democratic nominee for
Congress in the Third District, spoke in
the public park. Ho was very bitter in
bis denunciation o! Mr. Carlisle.
In beginning his speech Mr. Carlisle re
ferred to the Covington incident as fol-
Iowb:
I have the most profound respect for the.
honest opinions of every man who is willing
to have his opinions investigated a.nd dis
cussed before his fellow -citizens in the light of
reason and experience, but I have the most
supreme contempt for any man wno is unwill
ing to permit his opponent to discuss the polit
ical questions pending before the people. [Ap
plause.] Freedom of speech is one of the -
inalienable rights of America, and it cannot
be suppressed on the soil of Kentucky. [Ap
plause]
Among the telegrams Mr. Carlisle re
ceived at Bowling Green was the follow
ing:
Lincoln, 111., Oct. 24.
Hon. John O. Carlisle : Klve nundred law aud
order sound-money Democrats ot this county
resent the outrage of Covington hoodlums
and express continued confidence i:i you.
James T. Hoblet,
Member of National Democratic Stale Com
mittee.
Another was from F. C Runkle, chair
man of the executive committee of the
Railroad Men's Gold Rally of Louisville,
inviting him to attend the rally at the
Auditorium to-night.
LOUISVILLE. Ky., Oct. 24.â Mr. Car
lisle arrived in Louisville at 7:30 o'clock
to-night, but said it would be impossible
to make a speech at the railroad rally.
Last night Mr. Carlisle received telegrams
from all parts of the country and State
condemning the Covington affair. Many
of them urged him. not* to abandon his
other appointments. He replied: "I have
never contemplated abandoning them.
Free speech in Kentucky cannot be sup
pressed by any set of men."

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 24.â The great
scarcity of deep-sea tonnage has brought
about a remarkable condition of affairs in

been chartered for deep-sea voyages. One
of the largest has been chartered to load
on the berth at Baltimore with grain snd

Marine Spectacle by the
Sound Money Shipping

Two Hundred Different Craft
Participate in a Gorgeous
Night Parade.
GOLDEN SHOWERS IN THE SKY.
Never Before Has Such a Wondrous
Demonstration Been Made at
New York City.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 24.â The most
unique marine spectacle ever seen in the
â waters of tnis iarbor took place to-nipnt.
It was a magnificent display, partici
pated in by 200 different craft ana wit
nessed by an immense crowd of people.
The event was the nautical "grand lire
works display, illumination and marine \
parade" of the Shipping and Industrial ;
Sound-money Association in honor of Ale- |
Kinley and Hobart, :-.nd was the first j
demonstration of its character ever held j
hereabouts. From One Hundred and Thir- j
tieth street on the North Iliver, just above j
Grant' 3 torn'o, to Governors Island, off i
the battery, the flotilla steamed, every j
vessel in ea!a attire. For an hour or more .
the air was filled with a flood of brilliant j
lights and dazzling colors, showers of I
burning stars, torrents of coklen spray?,
batteries of colored candles and bombs â
for the time night seemed to have turned
into day.
The pyrotechnic feature of the evening |
â vus carried out on an elaborate scale, it
began with a saiute of 101 aerial guns, fol
lowed by an illumination of the harbor
by 590 colored lights, an ascension of
twenty-four balloons with powerful mag
nesium lights which lit up the city,
colossal lire pictures of McKinley and Ho- j
bart, umbrellas of fire, illuminated kites,
floating fesioons of fire, a magical lllu- .
mination of the harbor with chemical |
compounds, "the American flag unfurled I
in the sty" in fire colors, submarine ex- i
plosions, grand fire bouquets and innu- |
merablÃ other devices, which made the i
spectacle inspiring and seemingly magical
in character.
The nigh: was clear and cold when the i
parade began formation at 7 o'clock.
Steam craft only participated. The fleet
was in four divisions, the first in com
mand ot Kear- Admiral Staples, ttie second
under Kear-Atlmiral Dalzell, third under
Rear-Admiral Moore and the fourth in
charge of Admiral Valentine, and the j
whole under command of Admiral J. W. |
Miller. These titles, of course, were po
litical and conferred for the occasion.
The four divisions were composed of fonr
squadrons in each, and each squadron in
command of a commodore. The admiral's
staff, elaborate in numbers, was composed
of representatives of navigation in this
city. Commodore Michael Moran, a weil
known vessel-owner, was in charge of the
"flying squadron" of seven speedy tugs.
The fleet was formed at the lower end of j
the ralisades above. One Hundred and
Thirtieth street, the rirst and third di
visions on the west side and the second
and fourth on the east side of the river.
All divisions formed in column of vessels
heading down stream.
The preparatory signal was fired from
the flagship at 8 p. M. and immediately
the admiral's flagship and flying squad
ron proceeded to midstream. Atter a
short delay, amid the bowing of whistles,
the party started. The speed was six
Knots an hour, and to facilitate naviga
tion and prevent accident there was a
distance of 300 yards between divisions
ana 200 yards between squadrons. "When
the head of the column was abreast of
Grant's tomb the fireworks programme
was begun by a salute of 101 guns, foi
lowed by bombs, rockets, etc. The dis
play was continued as the vessels fell into
line, and as they passed down the river
there were more fireworks from anchored
flat boats at Weehawken, Stevens Point,
Fourteenth street, Hoboken and the Bat
tery. Every boat had its own supply of
pyrotechnics, too, and kept up a continual
bombardment along the route, which was
eight miles in length. The biggest dis
play was at the Battery, where the most
distinguished guests and the reviewing
party were assembled.
After passing the reviewing vessel the
larger craft passed around Governors
Island, throueh ButtermilK Channel, the
smaller np ihe East River, keeping near
the Brooklyn shore as !ar as Easi Twenty
fourth street. The squadrons were dis
missed after passing the reviewing boat.
It was 9:15 p. M. when the head of the
line reached the reviewing boat Aurora off
the Buttery. The arrival of the fleet was
greeted with a grand fireworks demonstra
tion. As each boat arrived she took up a
position opposite the Jersey shore and
soon the waters in the vicinity were alive
with brilliantly lighted vessels.
The trip down the river was a pictur
esque one. The great flotilla resembled a
big city. Nearly every boat, from the
saucy little tugs to the big twin screw
steamboats, was illuminated, some with
elaborate lines of lights, which, strung in
close around the decks, rails and hulls,
brought tne whole forms of the vessels
out in bold reliei.
Many piers along the river were illumi
nated in artistic sty.c, and the Jersey
ferry terminals had their slips conspicu
ously lighted. A number of buildings
near the water front, on the New York
were in festive attire. It is estimated that
over 25,000 persons were aboard thevessejs
in the parade, and that fully 200.000 were
gathered along the river on the banks and
piers from Grant's lomb to the Battery on
the New York side and the Palisades to
Jersey Citj', on the Jersey shore.
About 75.000 more were gathered in the
big office buildings and on roof tops of
hoaaei affording a view of the river.
LAST PARADES IN CHICAGO.
Fiftfien. 7hou*and Itnilway Men in a
Great 'Jarrhlifjht l'rocestton.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. ' 24.â Fifteen
thousand rail way employes to-night joined
in a torch and Jantern parade ior
"McKinley and sound monÂ»>y." AH the
roads entering the city were represented
by, largÃ* companies of men and several
had novel displays on floats, such' as
freight and passenger care,, miniature en
gines, red, white and blue headlights,'
searchlights, etc. Many clubs were in
uniforms peculiar to their employment, j
while others were attired as Zouaves or
wore gold capes or hats. Many carriages
laden with railroad officials and several
bodies were in line. Some of tie trans
parencies were quite orginal. One road
"No more fishing for G rover," another,
"We are coercedâ nit," a third, "If a gold
dollar is worth 200 cents we want it."
A large body of Bryan shouicrs carrying
a transparency with their favorite's pic
ture followed immediately in the wake of
the Republican parade.
Several thousand bicyclists also paraded
under the auspices of the National Wl eel
men's McKinley and Hobart Club. With
innumerable lanterns and decorations
they made a very pretty display.
The two big parades arranged for next
Saturday night have both been aban
doned. The Republicans had secured a
permit to parade on the south side and
the Democrats were granted a similar
privilege on the west side. Both wanted
to march over tne same route, and the
Democrats applied to the courts for an in
junction to prevent the police authorities
from interfering with their parade on the
south side. This was refused. Then the
Republicans decided to call .off their
parade, iv order to prevent possible
clashes between the two bodies. It is
said that they even offered to turn ever
their permit to the Democrats, but the
latter declined to accept such favor from
their opponents and declared their parade
alsj abandoned. To-night's demonstra
tions are, therefore, the last of their kind
in the present campaign.
PABST DIVORCED IN SECRET.
Secures Freedom From Margaret Mather,
Who Horsewhipped Him on a
Public Street.
MILWAUKEE, WnL, Oct. 24.~G-isiave
Pabst was divorced from Margaret Mather
in secret in the Circuit Court in this city
last Tuesday. Judge Johnson granted the
divorce on a complaint by Mr. Pabst,
which alleged that his wife was cruel, and
that she horsewhipped him on the street
October 2, 1895.
Every precaution was taken to keep the
divorce from the public. The court as
sembled during the noon hour, when all
the officers were absent at lunch.
As an additional precaution the rtoors
were barred and no one was admitted but
a representative of "Winckler, Flanders,
Smith, Bottum & Vilas, the attorneys for
Mr. Pabst, and General Horatio King 'of
New "Yorfc, representing the actress. No
answer was made to the complaint of Mr.
Pabst, who was allowed to take a decree
by default.
General King was present to look after
the interest of his client, who was re
ported to have $100,000 for allowing her
husband to secure a divorce without con
test. Miss Mather and Mr. Patnt were
secretly married during the summer of
1891 at Kenosha. Some months later the
affair was announced and they took up
their residence in this city and were sup
posed to be living together harjpily until
i a year ago, when Mrs. Pabst horse
l whipped her husband.
LOOK FOR THE LAST TIME
Thousands of Georgians Views
the Remains of Ex-Speaker
Crisp.
All Eve Military and Civic Honors
Accorded to the Deceased
Statesman.
ATLANTA, Ga., Oct. 24.â Thousands of
devoted Georgians looked to-day for the
last time upon the face of Charles Fred
erick Crisp as his body lay in state under
the dome of the Capito l . From 11 o'clock
this morning until 9 o'clock the people of
Atlanta and representative citizens from
other pans of the State in slow procession
passed the casket in the rotunda.
The escort accompanying :he body left i
the Halcyon, where Judge Crisp died, at ;
10:30 o'clock. Four white horses drew the j
funeral-car, which was followed by him- I
dreds of the statesman's sorrowing friends, j
Governor Atkinson and ex-Governor ;
W. J. Northen followed the hearse, and i
behind them were State and City officials, j
military and private citizens. When the |
casket was placed in the Capitol rotunda the j
dais wai covered with a wealth of beauti- ]
lul flowers. The casket lid was thrown
back and through the glass could be seen
the calm features of the dead. Sickness
had wasted Judge Crisp's streneth and !
his face was a little thinner t .an when he |
was in health.
Just before the end came, Mrs. Crisp
had passed out of the room for a breath of
fresh air, leaving Mr. Crisp with a nurse.
Mrs. Crisp remained away but a moment
or two, her husband sitting up in bed, his
pillows propped about him. Just as she
returned he looked toward her and plac
ing his hand to his heart, exclaimed, as
his features contracted with agony, "Oh,
that pain !" These were the last words
he spoke, for as soon as they were uttered
he fell over among the pillows, and when
his head was lifted the soul had gone out j
into the mysteries of the beyond. The
pained expression passed away and the
features were calm and peaceful.
A military guard was kept*y the casfcet
and the watch remained all night. Gover
nor Atkinson and an honorary escort ap
pointed from the General Assembly will
accompany the body to-morrow morning
to Amencus, Judge Crisp's late home.
The train will reach Americus to-morrow
at 2 o'clock, and the services will be con
ducted at 3. They will be in charge of
General Evans of Atlanta.

VIENNA, Austria., Oct. 24.â The rep

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
ARMOUR AFTER
CUDAHY'S SCALP
Drop in Wheat Prices Due
to an Old Elevator
Feud.
Some One Will Get Badly Pinched
Unless the Market Soon
Revives.
BEARS ARE KINGS OF THE PIT.
Fear on 'Change at Chicago That the
Coming Week Will Bring Forth
Failures.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 24.â The wheat
market was panic stricken on the Board
of Trade to-day. December went to
pieces at a disastrously rapid rate. The
worst break in the price occurred since
the 80-cent high mark was reached Mon
day, and traders were, left floundering in
a state of bewilderment and confusion. A
fall of 4 cents made a darK, hopeless pic
ture for the bulls to contemplate during
the day of rest. The week's tumble in the
price of the speculative future has been
over 10 cents. The low point reached
to-day was 69 cenis, and the closing price
was only % above. Yesterday's flnal
quotation was 73>Â£ cents.
The bears were kings of the wheat pit.
They forced the price down 3 cents at the
opening.
The Liverpool market was flat for
j futures, declining 2;^d, and the Chicago
market followed in the footsteps of the
Joreiguer. There was a brief rally of 1
cent or more and then came the 4-cent
break at 11 o'clock to till the holders of
long lines with fear that the market
might break them next weeK.
The big bulls are reported to be totter
j ing on the verge of a losing price as the
j market now stands to-nignt. Cudahy
' sold some of bis wheat on the last break,
I but the trade could only conjecture as to
I the quantity he got rid of. The general
| belief is that he could not have sold a big
I lot in the face of such a demoralized
| market, ready to drop the price at the
; least provocation.
There was a story going the rounds on
'Change to-day which revives the long
standing and bitter fight between the
Armour and other elevator interests and
the majority of the boaid, represented by
the directors. Mr. Armour has not for
given the prosecution of his firm by the
j directors on the charge that his elevators
were irregular, which ended in the sus
pension of his elevator manager, Valen
tine, for tweniy years. It is said that,
among the big bulls who are long on De
cember wheat are several members who
' are active In the light against the elevator
interests and that the latter, of which Mr.
Armour is the leader, are in a position to
squeeze these particular bulls to the break
ing point. There was an undercurrent of
fear on 'Change that next week will bring
failures of consequenct if there should be
another big fall in the price of wheat.
The material advance in the local mar
ket yesterday was expected to effect a
similar turn in the Liverpool market, but
when the reverse was flashed across sea
and land to the Chicago wheat pit the
news struck the bulls like lightning from
a cloudless sky. They were speechless
with surprise. They were unable to make I
a show of resistance and prices were ham
! mered down in the rir^t transactions to
: 70 cents. In the course of the next half
; hour's business there was a slow but
i steady advance to 70% cents.
Attention was directed to the domestic
j situation by the heavy movement of
; spring wheat in the Northwest. There
i was no encouragement for holders of high
â  priced wheat in the week's reports from
| the coasts and interior. Many well
| informed traders think the Liverpool de
j cline was engineered from this end. and
there was a free expression of opinion
that a leader in the provision trade was at
the bottom of it. John Cudahy and his
long wheat are supposed to be the objective
| point of the elevator men, or at least an
incident of their scheme.
It is believed that their chief reason for
spending a little money to break prices
is that the 60,000,000 bushels or so of
"hedged" wheat sold by the elevator men
of Chicago and the Northwest against
their cash holdings require a big sum of
money in the form of margins to conduct
their business, and they want to shake
down those margins at all hazards.
The outside trade has suffered seriously
by the present break, although that trade
is not as great as during former big wheat
flurries. Stop loss orders were the feature
of the market on the decline to 69 cents.
Most of the country buying orders were
only at figures above 70 cents. The cash
I wheat situation is still a disturbing factor
in the market, and difficulty in obtaining
money to carry grain is given as one of
the chief reasons for the anxiety to un
load. Small holders were obliged to let go
at a loss, and there was tumbling of
pyramids. Altogether it was the most
demoralized trade of the year, bringing
more trouble than joy to all who partici
pated.

when everybody in England surrendered
himself to blind rase against the German
Emperor, and the memorable &tcp of
mobilizing a special service squadron was
taken, the people who feel a special inter
est in strengthening the British navy took
advantage of the popular feeling to ar
range that hereafter Trafalgar day shoujd
be celebrated as a national patriotic anni
versary . As the date drew near the Gov
ernment tried all it could quietly* to dis
courage the thing, but the enthusiasts in
sisted, and considering the absence of
organization and the official cold water
Wednesday's celebrations throughout the
island were very creditable.
Unhappily, however, no amount of
British protestations could avail to pre
vent the French from remsmbenng tha^
Trafalgar was their defeat, and not unnat
urally they asked why on earth tnis
year of all others this piece of ancient his
tory should be so violently revived, espe
cially as the English are just now profess
ing an exceptional anxiety to establish
cordial relations with France. It has been
an uphill task for the English papers to
explain the psychology of this paradox,
and Paris still only half accepts their plea
that John Bull i 3 really such an ingenuous,
Bimple-minded creature that he blunders
into these embarrassing performances
through sheer mental awkwardness. As
the Continental situation stands, it was
undoubtedly the most inopportune thing
imaginable, but perhaps its effect in stimu
lating popular feeling here counterbal
ances any harm it may have done across
the channel.
Germany' 3 journalistic bombardment of
England seemed last week to be impor
tant. The attacks continue, although
somewhat abated in vigor, but England has
decided to pretend to be unconscious of
them. This course robs the affair of a
good deal of its interest, especially for the
Germans, and their position when stripped
of expletives has something in it. They
say that a Continental war must involve
for the Continental peoples the most terri
ble ordeal in history, with frightful carn
aee, inestimable losses and the result of
putting back the' clock of civilization a
quarter of a century. England, gorged
with empire to the point of satiety and so
placed on the map moreover that she is
practically secured from invasion and
actual suffering in such a war, calmly
proposes to precipitate a Continental con
vulsion on purely sentimental grounds
and she ought therefore to be treated as a
common enemy by all the rest of the Con
tinental powers. This, of course, is what
will always be said by one side so long as
England pursues her historic policy of
balancing between the two armed camps
into which Europe is divided, leaning
now a little toward one and now
toward the other, but always keeping
beyond the reach of actual danger. The
fact that the Germans are shouting so an
grily now reveals a suspicion, or perhaps
the knowledge that England is tipping
the scales on the side of the Franco-Rus
sian combination. This alone would make
a weight against whicn the triple alliance
would be powerless. If Italy be detached
from the alliance into the bargain, as is
now keenly feared at both Berlin and
Vienna, then the bottom will fail out of
the central European partnership at once.
For the moment there seems to be a dis
tinct possibility that this is what is going
to happen, but the situation is still at a
stage where new combinations can be
made if high enough price is paid for
them. Germany's real trouble lies in the
fact that she has next to nothing to offer
in proposing such a bargain, whereas EDg
land is provided with a large variety of
tempting wares.
Rome has kept itself distinctly cool
durins the week of wedding festivities,
culminating with to-day's ceremony. The
official reports describe the enthusiastic
cheers of rapturous multitudes, but inde
pendent observers all tell a different story.
The Queen of Portugal indeed received on
her arrival such chilling treatment from
the Roman crowd that she refused to ap
pear next day with the royal party that
received the bride, and she is said to have
been on the point of quitting the city
altogether. This, of course, is ascribable
to Italian recollections of the King of
Portugal's very stupid quarrel with his
uncle Humbert last year; but apart from
that the Italians are in a surly state of
mind toward the whole governmental es
tablishment.
No doubt this Montenegrin marriage is
more popular than almost any other would
have been, Dut Italy is too sict of such
things in general to feel warmly about it.
One of the most peculiar things of this
whole Italian wedding affair has been
Prince Victor Bonaparte's repeated ap
pearance in public with various members
of the Orleans family, a phenomenon
which raises again the suspicion that the
two French dynastic parties are in the way
of pooling their issues. Paris on November
5, the date finally fixed for the marriage
of the Duke of Orleans, will =cc a great
gathering of legitimists at the Madeleine,
where the wedding mass is to be cele
brated to synchronize with the actual
ceremony ac Schonbrunn. This will be
followed by a grand banquet at the Hotel
Continental.
Wi en recently in Paris I did not find
among the republican politicians of vari
ous shades any idea that the republic had
anything to fear from the ambitions of
Philippe VIL They agreed that if he had
been a different sort of a person, he might
have done something, but as they put it,
a man who cannot mount a horse without
falling off and breaking his leu has no
chance wnh the French public. Un
doubtedly, however, his marriage into the
richest and most respected branch of the
Hapsburgs gives him new importance in
the eyes of Continental diplomatists.
Rumors of an impending revival of
Carlist activity in the Biscay provinces
continue to circulate, but in the quarter
where in the past I have always found
very accurate and up-to-date information
about the purchaseof arms and munitions
and about other Carlist enterprises, noth
ing seems to be known of any new move
ment. Very possibly the present reports
arise from a vague feeling tnat Spain is in
bach a helpless.plight that everything evil
will happen. Canovas talks now of an
appeal ad misericorciiam to the public for
a popular loan of ?<JO,COO,OOO to carry the
two colonial wars over Christmas without
convening Parliament, and the Spanish
papers loyally declare that the plea would
be successful, but it is not yet clear that
all chance of getting the needed money
from France has disappeared.
There are certain obscure signs that
Morocco is again coming to the front as a
factor in the European situation, and here
Spain could be of immense direct service
to France. Indeed, all that Spain has left
of value in Old World politics is her
shadowy title to be considered when
Morocco comes to be cut up. She could
not enforce the claire, but she could pawn
it to France, and the suspicion that some
thing of this sort may be done is in tne
air. If England, Russia and France are
seriously examining the ways and means
of forming a combination for general
Levantine purposes, it is unlikely that the
possibility of allowing France to take
Morocco as compensation for Egypt has
remained undiscussed. The whole Mo
rocco question, however, Gristles with dif
ficulties, ana no power will raise it unless
some big final scheme of settlement is
within sight.
What was predicted has happened. Not
a whisper is now heard from any quarter
about rpgarding Lord Rosebery as the
possible future leader of the Liberals. He
has passed absolutely out of the plans of
the party workers, and apparently he is
not very far from reading himself out of the
party into the bargain. It would almost
seem as if the Liberal-Unionists were
frightened at the notion that he intends
to join them, for Mr. Courtney attacked
him bitterly on Thursday over the Egyp
tian business, ana on the following day
Mr. Chamberlain made a slashing assault
on his Lordship's gloomy talk about Ger
man trade competition. One cannot help
pittying Lord Rosebery and realizing that
his calamitous failure was largely due to
physical causes. He used to be such a
gay -spirited, hopeful figure in politics be
fore that wretched mistake of his in al
lowing himself to be pushed into a place
he was unable to All came to sour his
temper, break his nerve and put the in
tolerable curse of sleeplessness upon him.
Now he is peevish, suspicious, and above
all pessimistic. He still can shape jokes
lor after-dinner speeches, but they all
nave a bitter sub-acid taste. He is tilled
with apprehensions whichever way he
looks, and he groans aloud over the
troubles he foresees.
Englishmen have more toleration for a
Mrs. Guminidge in politics than most
other people, But they draw the line at
such persistent all-round dolefulness as
Lord Rosebery's.
In the way of pessimism it would be
hard to beat a letter on the American situ
ation just received by the Daily Mail from
its regular New York correspondent.
Having first described himself as an
American, this gentleman proceeds to
warn Euglish investors that the Ameri
cans desire a war with England, mainly
because it will then be possible to repudi
ate every dollar of American indebtedness
to Lombard street, and to confiscate every
dollar's worth of British property owned
in the United States. After pointing out
that the better element in America op
posed the separation of the colonies from
England 120 years ago the correspondent
laments that the same better element is
now equally helpless to prevent the Re
public lrom sinking through foul corrup
tion and ignorance into political and so
cial chaos. He thinks that Mr. McKinley
will be defeated, but says that even if he
should be elected there will be a civil war
between the East and the West.
It is a relief to turn from the vaporings
of this native Jeremiah to another feature
of the bright Daily Mail's cosmopolitan
enterprise. Some months ago it sent G.
W. Stevens, the cleverest of the original
Pail Mall Gazette young men, to America
to write a long series of letters on what
ever interested him. Many of these now
appearing are.of very notable quality, and
when in permanent lorm they will be
valued I think in America. Mr. Stevens'
pen picture of Chicago in Thursday's issue
of the Mail is about the most vivid por
trayal of a city on a small canvass that I
know. Incidentally his book on naval
policy published on Trafalgar day received
long and favorable reviews as a weighty
and important production.
Roars of laughter have greeted the in
genious effort which was made by the par
son ot Burnham Thorpe, the little village
where Nelson was born, to turn the Tra
falgar celebration to practical use. He in
serted in every London paper on the morn
ing of the 21st, and at the top of the "Per
sonal" advertisements, this touching
poem:
He who taneht Englishmen to do their duty
And km with wooden walls his natlre isle
Asks for one shilling to restore to beauty
The church which brooked o'er his iufant smile.
There has been earnest competition
among the London publishers for Dr.
Nansen's forthcoming book, for which, it
was said, prices had been offered far ex
ceeding preceaent. Several reports that
it had been secured have been current,
but I ieara to-night that a comparatively
new firmâ that of Archibald Constable,
composed of a young man named Double
day and George Meredith's son â has
finally secured ali rights for the British
empire and for America. The price paid
was 150,000, which is by far the largest
ever given here to a non-Enghsu author.
The German rights were obtained by
Brockhaus for $10,000, and Hachette is con
sidering a like price for the French rights.
Thus far the American publishers have
declined to pay more than $10,000 for the
American rights, and this scares the Con
stables, who seem to have counted on
much more.
Au entirely unexpected complication
has risen in Paris over the publication of
George Samib' love letters, preliminary
. extracts of which have been given lately
to the French press. The most important
of the letters were to Alfred de Musset,
but there are also a number to the Italian
doctor, Pagello, who, while professionally
attending Musset when the latter and
George Sands were at Venice in 1^34,
came to have a principal part in the
romance himself. George Sands' seems to
have taken more interest in this brief
liaison than in any other of her other
affairs of the kind. Her letters to Pagello
are said to be the most striking in the
collection, but it is unlikely that the pub
lic will ever see them, for Pa>;ello turns
out to be alive and he protests bitterly
against having Ms youth dragged up
against him and his large and deeply re
spectable family in this fashion. He
avers that it is "sixty-two years since he
saw or heard from George Sands, and it is
believed thai the French courts will agree
with him in calling that fair ground for
outlawry.
The Typographical Union here finds
itself in a queer predicament over this
week's contest of *peed on the linotype
machine at the Aquarium. Up to the
present the union has insisted on 5000
ens, an amount which equals half as
many American ems, as a fair hourly
average for sKilled compositors, and when
affidavits came from America stating that
10.000 ens were nearer such an average
the union denounced these statements
as worthless. It happens now, however,
that some twenty members of the union
have been competing this week for a gold
medal, and the very poorest of them all
set over 10,000 ens, bo it will be impos
sible for the union to resist a rearrange
ment of terms any longer.
The first volume of Victor Hugo's let
ters is annoying from a craftsman's point
of new, since it shows no system of selec
tion of arrangement and contains not a
single explanatory note. This shuts out
all who are not familiar with Hugo's
career and associations. Others, how
ever, will find the book an extraordinary
mine of wholly new material.
Alphonse Daudet's health has undei
gone quite a remarkable change for the
better. He now walks about Paris again
like a new man. Daudet lauehs at the
reports that Edmond de Goncourt's will
can be upset and that bis academy scheme
has been abandoned. He says, on the
contrary, that it will soon be on a work
intr basis.
The Times to-day accords high though
not unqualified praise to the first install
ment of Profess <r Sloane's great "Life
of Napoleon." The review in closing,
describes the book as the serious and caie
ful work of a very competent historian.

RUFFIANS IN THE
GERMAN UNIFORM
Bold Blackguards Who Are
a Disgrace to William's
Army.
Clamor of the People Against
Outrages Committed by
Aristocratic Curs.
LIEUTENANT BRUTZWITZ' ACT.
For Wantonly Murdering an Ineffjn*
sive Citizen He Is Imprisoned
and Degraded.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 24.â The con
ciliatory tendencies which are understood
to characterize the Government's new bill
for the reform of the military code of pro
cedure, which is to be introduced in the
Reichstag at the beginning of the session
of that body next month, is partly ex
plained by the universal feeling of indig
nation which has been created by the cow
ardly outrages which have recently been
committed upon unarmed and defenseless
civilians by army# officers, an example of
which was furnished a week or so ago by
the dastardly attack made r.pon a civilian
at Carlsruhe by Lieutenant Bruzwitz, who
has since been sentenced to four j r ears'
imprisonment in a fortress and dismissed
from the army, greatly to the surprise of
everybody.
Another cause of the mild tone of the
Government's demands in respect to the
military code bill is the fact that the ne
cessities of the Government require that
the Reichstag shall grant a very large in
crease xn the credits for the army and
navy, and the Kaiser and his advisers are
unwilling to risk the defeat of their plans
by adhering to their former unbending
position in regard to the military bill,
which, in view of the present aspect of
union affairs, has become a matter of little
if any importance in the eyes of tjie Gov
ernment in comparison with the matter of
increasing Germany's military and naval,
strength as largely and speedily as possi
ble.
It is now known that the Ernperoi's
proposals, which have been alluded to as
merely intended to improve the artillery
arm of the military service, involve the
complete reconstruction of the batteries,
the augmentation of the number and cali
ber of the field guns and an extensive- al
teration of the naval equipments.
Tbe Freisinnige press are all up in arms
and declare that an organized and power
ful opposition will make a vigorous on
slaught on the war budget in the Reich
stag, and insist upon straightforward ex
planations on the part of the Government
to categorical explanations. It is easy to
foretell that the Government will reply
that tbe explanations are impossible inas
much as they would reveal secrets incident
to the defense of the countrj". The claims
of the Government will be referred to a
committee of the Reichstag, and that they
will be subsequently voted favorably there
is no doubt.
In regard to the outrages by military
officers on civilians it is notable that the
long-suffering German bourgeoise are
losing patience, and the murder of Sieb
mann by Lieutenant Bruzwitz at Carls
ruhe seems likely to bring about a climax
throughout Germany, especially in the
south, where every town is organizing
meetings to protest against the ruffianism
indulged in by army officers. The news
papers are also taking part in the matter,
and also publish incredible stories about
the outrages which aristocratic black
guards in tbe army perpetrate upon
civilians at Carlsruhe. It is not Bruzwitz
alone that is complained of, but a number
of other officers ot the ferenade regiment
to which Bruzwitz belonged are charged
with a variety of criminal excesses.
General yon Bulow, commanding the
army corps of which Carlsruhe is the
headquarters, has found it advisable to
forbid officers entering public places for
the last fortnight as a precautionary
measure.
The feud between the English and Ger
man press is being kept up and pursued
Witn great vigor. The Berlin papers think
it worth while to reproduce the opinions
of nameless writers in the London press,
and every day these opponents slang each
other about the effect of their differences
over the relations of Germany, Russia,
France and England. Long and costly
telegrams conveying conversational chat
ter of this character appear in the German
press daily. In official circles this sort of
thing was amusing at the outset, but has
now become absolutely worthless and has
lost its significance, even as a source of
amusement.
Ttae directors of the Reichsbank, at a
meeting held just prior to the increase of
the discount rate of the Bank of England,
decided that it was not necessary to make
an advance in the discount rate of the
Reichsbank beyond 5 per cent. To-day
baiiKmg opinion points to an increase in
the rate early next week. Despite the
differences between the open discount
rates and those of the Reichsbank, gold
does not go into the Reichsbank, and if
the accounts of the bank were examined
it would be seen that the drain toward
Russia equals the inflow into the bank.
The Russian Imperial Bank reduced the
price it pays for gold by 1 per cent until
the Bank of England raised its rate of
discount, when the Russian bank raised
its price for cold. Still gold goes to
Russia.
The society of Berlin workingmen held
a meeting to-day to discuss the matter of
the Government's prosecution for lese
majsste. Fifteen hundred persons as
sembled, and the liberal leader, Professor
Quidde, was expected to address them.
Max Ross, who presided, opened the
meeting, and in the course of his remarks
criticized severely the large number of
prosecutions for what was regarded as
lese ma jest*. A large force of police were
within the precincts of the hall and
seized the opportunity afforded by the
remarks of Herr Ross to close the meet
ing, which they did very unceremoniously.
The Rhine Gazette publishes a report of
the case of a dragoon captain assaulting a

Portuguese Are Defeated.
LISBON, Portugal, Oct. 24.â A dispatch
to the Government from Mozambique
eives the details of the repulse of a Portu
guese expedition in Manicaland.
The expedition, which comprised 300
Portuguese and 180 natives, was com
manded by Major Mousinho Albuquerque,
Governor-General of Mozambique. It was
surprised by a force of 2000 natives, be
longing to the Namaralios tribe, and a
fight that lasted for twenty-two hours
ensued.
The Portuguese force was finally com
pelled to retreat, with the loss of two
killed and thirty-five wounded. Among
the latter was Captain-General Albuquer
que. The enemy lost heavily.
LILLIAN TO WED ONCE MORE.
For the Fifth Time Miss Russell Will
Take a HusbandâWalter Jones
the Man.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 24.-A Herald
special from St. Louis says:
For tne fifth time in her comic-opera
career Miss Lillian Russell is reported on
the eve of a matrimonial venture. The
wedding, it is said, will take place in San
Francisco about the middle of November
and the groom will be Walter Jones of
"In Gay New York."
Miss Russell played here last week at
the New Century Theater. Mr. Jones and
"In Gay New York" followed this week.
The prima donna remained over one day
in order to meet him, and, so the story
goes, the matter was arranged. Miss Rus
sell des'red that it be kepi a secret, but
Mr. Jones, indiscreet in his happiness,
told a fellow-actor, and thenâ well, of
course, every one knew it to-day.
Mr. Jones, when seeu this afternoon,
acknowledged that he was engaged to
marry Miss Russell. Asked about the date
of the wedding, he replied: "Miss Rus
sell will arrange that, but it will probably
be in San Francisco in the middle of No
vember. We "both play there about that
time."
Between the acts to-night Mr. "Jones
said that Miss Russell was not yet divorced
from Signor Perugini, but added: "I ex
pect her to get-a divorce within a week or
two, and then I'll have a story for you
newspaper men."
PREPARING THE MESSAGE.
President Cleveland Will Recommend the
Retirement of Greenbacks and
Treasury Notes.
NEW YORK, K. V., Oct. 24.â A Tribune
special from Washington says: President
Cleveland has betrun work on his annual
message to Congress. Besides treating
the numerous matters which will come
before Congress the President expects to
be able to congratulate the country on tbe
triumph of sound-money principles at the
general election. The President remains
so confident of McKinley's election that
he thinks the question of probabilities un
worthy of discussion.
A part of the message will be given up
to a consideration of the financial ques
tion. It is said the message will contain
a recommendation for the retirement of
the greenbacks and treasury notes and
that the President will declare himself
thoroughly of the opinion that this is the
only practical remedy for the financial
situation.
To accomplish this he may recommend
the issue of United States bonds at a low
interest for a long term of years.

Secured Very- Little Monet/.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 24.â A. Wygant,
general agent of the United Express Com
pany, said last night that the Chicago and
Alton train which was held up in the Blue
Cut, near Independence, Mo., last night,
never carried much money. None is
shipped from Chicago by it, and what
there was in the express-car must have
been small sums from way stations. The
amount in the express-car would not ex
ceed $2000 in his opinion, and the robbers
got very little of that. They succeeded
in capturing the train, but the messenger
hid most of the money before they entered
the car. The robbers uncoupled the en
gine and escaped on it.

CONFIDENCE MEN
VISIT VALLEJO
Wine Merchant Chabot the
Victim of a Pair of
Rogues.
Discovers That He Paid a Round
Sum for a Heap of
Pebbles.
WHERE IGNORANCE WAS BLISS
Kept the Rocks in His Safe a Week
Before Learning His
Error.
VALLEJO, Cal., Oct. 24.â J. Chabot of
the firm of J. Chabot & Co., local wine
merchants, discovered this morning that
he had been bnnkoed out of $745. The
method was not a new one â the "now-you
see-it-and-now-you-don't" scheme â but
that does not allay the grief of the victim.
Two Frenchmen came to his place a
week ago and negotiated for the business,
agreeing to pay $1950. One of them was
known to the partner of Chabot, who be
came acquainted with him in sunny
France. The man suggested that they go
to the residence of Chabot and draw up
the papers for the sale. This was agreed
to, and the three started for the house.
One of them carried a small black valise,
which they said contained the money to
pay for the place.
On arriving at the residence of Chabot,
the three sat down at a table and Chabot
wrote the bill of sale, one of the men sign
ing his cross to the document. The valise
was then opened on the table. Inside of
it there was a pasteboard lid, as is found
in all common small satchels. When
opened one side of the satchel remained
covered by the lid. The other contained
a small, black tin box, which was opened
with a key. The box held quite a number
of stacks of twenty-dollar pieces. These
were counted by Chabot, but found to be
less than the $1950.
The strangers insisted that Chabot put
up some money to bind the bargain, as
they said they would leave their money
with him until they returned in a few
days with thÃ remainder of the cash
needed to make the purchase.
Chabot went into the next room, where
his safe stood, to take out money to be
used in addition to that which he had in
his pocket. This amounted to $745, which
was also placed in the tin box aside of the
the stacks of twenties. The lid was closed
and locked, one of the men putting the
key into his pocket.
Chabot suggested that they take the box
of gold down to the Valiejo Commercial
Bank and deposit it, as he did not care to
have such a large sum of money in his
house, but the men objected, saying they
were perfectly satisfied to leave it in hi 3
care, as they had so much faith in his
honesty. While they were talking, Chabot
remembers that he passed out of the room
once to gel something from the safe. As
the men still insisted that he keep the
box containing the money, he lifted it out
of the satchel, carried it into the next
room and placed it in the safe, to remain
until the men should return with the bal
ance of the purchase money.
The younger man closed the satchel and
the three returned to the wine depot,
when all partoot of a friendly, glass, and
spent the remainder of the day until it
was time for the strangers to leave for San
Francisco^ in looking over the stock of
eoods. When they departed, they said
they would leave the satchel, as it was of
no further use to them. They had pur
chased it only to carry their box of money
in.
Several days elapsed and the men failed
to show up with the money. Chabot and
his partner thought it somewhat strange.
During the week he had occasion several
times to go to the safe, and each time he
saw the little black tin box resting in the
inner vault where he had placed it
This morning something impelled him
to take out the box and shake it. He did
so, and as the sound did not have the
metallic ring of gold he procured a chisel
and pried open the lid. To his astonished
gaze there appeared nothing but a heap of
pebbles.
Then it dawned upon Cbabot that he
had been duped out of $745 in gold coin.
He lost no time in reporting the fraud to
the officers, who have a full description of
the two men. The strangers are probably
out of the country by this time, they hav
ing had a fuil weeKs start. One of the
confidence men is about 40 years of age,
of low stature and with a black mous
tache. The other is about 26 years
old, smooth-faced and slightly lame.
Chabot is of t!;e opinion that they had
two boxes. The one containing the* rocks
was concealed by the closed lid of the sat
chel. Il was exchanged fÂ«r the box con
taming the money, when be passed out of
the room. It never entered his mind to
ask them to open the box before he placed
it in the safe, as he shut the lid himself,
saw with his own eyes the money and
handed the key to one of the men.
The strangers are known in San Fran
cisco and for the present the local officials
and Chabot are withholding their names
on the doubtful hope that they may yet be
frighiened away if the names were pub
lished. The victim of misplaced confi
dence states that he is willing to spend
$1000 to apprehend the men and keep them
from bilking any one else. He still holds
the bill of sale, but it is of no value to any
one and the wine depot is still on the mar
ket.

Brain is the modern money-maker. : It is a delicate, sensitive piece of mechanism,
easily wrecked, and when wrecked the life of â¢ the individual is wrecked with it." A
healthy body is an indispensable requisite for a healthy brain, and a healthy condi-
tion of the nervous system is absolutely necessary for the enjoyment of.perfect physi-
cal and mental strength and vigor. Thus it will be see v that as brain is the money-
maker and eood health the = power that moves the brain, no one can afford to ignore
the signs that give warning of the approach of failing health and of failing manly
powers, which warning, if not heeded, will soon. transform a strong, healthy man into
a weak, feeble, lifeless one, who will' find neither pleasure nor success in any under-
taking. There are a variety of causes to which this deplorable state of nervous debil-
ity or exhaustion is due, chief of which are excessive indulgences, youthiul indiscre-
tions, overstudy, mental worry, etc. Its existence is marked by a variety of symp-
toms, such a3 weakness of body and mind, brain fag, dizziness, loss of memory a
wandering mind, lack of energy and confidence/pains in the head and back, dimness
of vision, discontent, despondency, an aversion to society, dread of impending danger

AWFUL DEATH
James L. Pace Loses His
Life in a Fire Near
Woodland.
Burned to a Crisp While His
Family Is Powerless to
Save Him.
FLAMES DESTROY EIS HOME.
The 0 d Man Ventures lato a Room
Filled With Smoke and
Is Suffocated-
WOODLAND, Cat.., Oct. 24.â James L.
Pace.tone of Yolo County's oldest citizens,
met a horrible death last night. He was
â¢burned to a crisp in the presence of his
horror-stricken wife and children, who
were powerless to extend him help.
The Pace family resides on a pretty little |
farm about threo miles north of Cache- |
ville. The house was a two-story frame
building, with a one-story annex, which
was used as a kitchen. The evening meal j
was served at the usual time, and the fam- ;
ily and Mrs. H. S. Hutton of Berkeley re
tired at an early hour. The inmates had
been in. bed only a few minutes when a
roar was heard from the direction of the j
kilchen. Mr. Face, followed by the ladies,
ran downstairs into the hall.
When Mr. Pace opened the kitchen door
a great flood of light and fire shot out into
the other room. One of the daughters
saw her father pass into the kitchen. That
was the last seen of him alive. She at
tempted to follow, but was restrained by j
a hired man just in time to save her life, j
Ralph, the son of the deceased man, I
made desperate efforts to reach his father,
but was driven back by heat and smoke â
not, however, until he was severely burned
about the hands and face.
By this time the yard was filled with j
neighbors who had been attracted by the j
tire and who had heard the screams of the i
mother and daughter. A young man !
named Zimmerman was tue first to dis- i
cover the body. It was in a sitting post
ure and one hand was held over the head
as if to protect the face from the heat.
Mr. Pace had reached the door opening on j
the north porch before, he succumbed to ;
suffocation. Another moment of con
sciousness and he would have been saved, j
He apparently lell against the door, sank j
down beside it and was sustained in an !
upright position until the door was burned
away.
The building and contents were a total i
loss. Tne occupants escaped in their
nightclothes. The tire probably started
from a defective flue. Mrs. Hutton lost !
$95 in gold and a valuable watch.
MOURNING AT STANFORD.
Mrs. Â£. H. Criggs Succumbs to Typhoid i
Fever After an Illness of Several
Weeks.
STANFORD, UNIVERSITY, Cal., Oct. j
24. â Mrs. E. H. Griggs, wife of Professor j
Griggs, head of the department of ethics j
here, died this morning after several j
weeks' illness. Mrs. Griggs was attacked j
by typhoid lever some time ago and the j
fatal disease gradually wasted away aeon- {
stitution naturally strong and robust. The
end came unexpectedly, for so well had the
patient borne up that it was not felt that
her life was in serious danger. She passed j
away with her soriowing husband at her
'side.
Faculty and students are alike
filled with sympathy for the husband.
Mrs. Griggs Â»was very popular with the
students with whom she was brought in
contact through her husband's position.
She was of a bright, cheery, genial dis
position, possessed of a highly cultured
mind and a faculty for making friends.
Her taking away removes one of the gen
tlest and most charming characters from
the circle of Stanford life. The funeral â¢
will taKe place at 3:43 p. m. to-morrow.

JOINT DEBALT AT MADERA.
Judge Swinne-rton and Thomas V. Cator
Match Arguments.
MADERA, Cal,, Oct. 24.â The joint ae
bale in Athletic Haii to-night between
Judge Swinnerton for tbe Republicans and
Thomas V. Cator for the Populists and
Democrats brought out a large and en
thusiastic crowd for ooth parties. Athletic
Hall was inadequate to hold all, and many
voters were unable to gain admittance.
The stage was occupied, by a large num
ber of vice-presidents drawn from all the
parties, and the hall was profusely dec
orated. Professor W. H. Williams pre
sided over the meeting for the Republi
cans. He introduced Judge Swinnerton,
who made the opening argument and said
that the debate was as to whether the
country wouid regain prosperity tnrou^h
Republican protection or Democratic and
Popuhstic free silver.
Judge Swinnerton, in his opening ad
dress, dwelt upon the rapid fall from
â¢prosperity to poverty under the C.eve
land administration, and called upon his
opponent to show how the financial legis
lation of the past had any influence to
ward bringing about the conditions tbat
now confronted tbe coiftitry. He described
the aggressive shipping policy that Eng
land followed, and the power that *he ac
quired in that, manner. He claimed that
England, which had always gone forth as
a warrior, came to America in tbe habili
ments of a lover, had wooed and won tbe
scarlet woman of American politics, and
Wilson was the priest wi.o tied the
nuptial knot that caused such rejoicing in
England. He closed with an appeal. to
voters to vote as Americans and not as
politicians.
Cator had an hour in which to reply.
He cited Republican aut orities to the
eSect that the contraction of the currency
was the original and primary cause of the
impoverishment of the masses. He at
tacked the tariff theory, claiming that free
silver was the best protective tariff pos
sible.
Judge Swinnerton was allowed half an
hour in wbicn to close the debate in be
half of the Republicans.

tion were deafening.

"The point of the knife strucK the
sevenih rib on the left side, then g anccd I
downward about an inch and struck the '
eighth rib. If the knife had not struck a
rib it would have penetrated the heart.
The blow must have had great force, as
the kn fe went through a thick vesi and
the end of a neckiie, a white shirt and a
heavy undergarment, and then made a !
wou 1 d an inch in length. The wound j
bied very fretly, but it is superficial, and
the injured man will be out again in a few
days."
In regard to his assailant Mr. Walthall

that be was in danger o: being captured, j

SUTTER CREEK'S
GREAT RALLY
Miners Along the Mother
Lode Enthusiastic for
Protection.
Three Thousand People Hear an
Address by .- amuel M.
Shortridge.
BRYANISM PUT TO FLIGHT.
Amador County's Answer to These
Who Claim It for the
Nebraskan.
SUTTER CREEK, Cal., Oct. 24.â Fully
3000 prop.c assembled in Sutter Creek to
n'ght to listen to Samuel M. Shortridge's
eloquent presentation of Republican ar
| guments. The little mountain city was
labiaz- with party enthusiasm. Voters
i gathered from every nooK and corner of
the county, Jackson. Vo.cano. Pine Grove,
Plymouth, Oleta, Dr town and Amador
City being represented by large delega
tions. Tnree urass bands supplied music,
! giant powder boomed a noisy greeting
j irom the hills above the town, and on
every hand cou/d be heard the cheers for
McKinley and Hobart.
The voters along this portion of the
great mother lode gave "our Sam" a mm!
-! ers' wel' orae, and in return he gave them
I one of the mast inspiring and convincing
political speeches ever heard in Amador
County. If there wa* any doubt be ore as
to how this county would rate on Novem
ber 3, there is none now. Shortriiige has
turned the tide, and little Aniador will
roll up a rousing majority for the Repub
lican standard-bearer. Bryanism has lost
its grip here.
Those who witnessed the enthusiastic
greeting accorded the San Franciscan,
who saw how well he held his audience in
band throughout, and who heard tne com
ments that followed his speech, know that
this is no idle boast. The many who were
in doubt were made to see the light, and
the speaker's vivid comparison of De
mocracy's failures with Republican suc
cesses struck home to each of his hearers.
He pictured the denetits that would ac
crue to Caiifornians under a McKinley
tariff, and explained the attitude of his
party toward silver, convincing his
nearers that it was the only true friend
the white metal had.
LOS ANGELES' FEAST OF REASON.
General Chipman Attacks the Financial
Policy of Bryan.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 24.â The
Republican meeting at Hazard's Pavilion
this evening was presided over by J. S.
Slauson, late candidate for the nomination
of his party for Mayor of the city. The
great pavilion was well filled with the
sturdy yeomanry of the city and vicinity.
The principal address of the evening was
delivered by General N. P. Chipraan.
In opening General Chipman said it is
about decided that William McKinley
would be the next President of the United
States. He felt called upon, therefore, to
refer at the outset to a State matter, viz.,
whether the citizens present would vote
for legislative candidates who would sup
port a Republican or for that renegade,
Thomas V. Cator.
Referring to National issues, the speaker
saiil that the tariff question was pretty
well settled on Republican lines and he
would, therefore, devote his time to the
money question. The Democratic party
asserted that our mints should be opened
to the unlimited coinage of silver on an
arbitrary ratio, regardless of the relative
commercial vaiues of the precial metals.
The commercial ratio, as was well known,
was now 30 to 1, whereas it was proposed
by the Bryanites to force a legal ratio
in which the white metal would be used
to the detriment of every debtor as well as
every creditorâ a d triment as to value for
the latter and one of common honesty for
the former. Was this species of dishonesty
to be encouraged ? he asked. â¢
Respecting the so-called "crime of
1873," the general inquired wtio demanded
a modification or repeal ot the act of 1873.
Did the people in general make any such
demand? Not at all. The silver mine
owners were the only persons who peti
tioned Congress to modify the act of 1873.
In respons to this demand of the mine
owners, the Bland- Allison law was enacted
and the mine-owners and they only were
Mr. Cator was arraigned for some of his
absurd and silly claims regarding the per
capita circulation, and the doctrine that
"good times" aim "large per capita" cir
culation went hand in hand.
STOCKTON DEMONSTRATION
Hon. W. R. Davis of Oakland Delivers
n Speech to thousands.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 24.â Agricultural
Pavilion was crowded to-night by one of
the largest throngs that has gathered here
during the present campaign. The
speaker of the evening was W. R. Davis of
Oakland. He was escorted from hi* hotel
to the pavilion by the drill corps of the
McKinley and Hobart Club in full uni
form, headed by the Sixth Regiment band.
As Chairman Nelson of the Republican
Central Committee advanced through the
throng with the speaker of the evening a
cheer was sent up.
J. R. Koch, Councilman from the Fourth
Ward, was introduced as chairman of the
meeting, and after a few words of greet
ing presented the Oakland attorney to the
audience. He was not long in captivating
his listeners, and although the evening,
was cold few left the big building until his
last words had died away with the cheers
of the crowd. The leading business men
of ttie community were attentive listeners
at to-nigh 's meeting. This has marked
all the Republican meetings, but more
especially that of to-nicht.
Great preparations are being made for
the reception of Tom Reed next Wed
nesday night. In early days he taught
school in Stockton and this is familiar
ground to him.
SANTA BARBARA ENTERPRISE.
Women Itsue an Equal Suffrage Edition
of thr- Independent.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 24.â The
daily Independent of this place came out
to-day with an equal suffrage ' diiion ed
ited by representative women of Santa
Barbara. This edftion is not only a very
creditable product, presenting in matter
and arrangement a most attractive ap
pearance, but it has created a genuine seu
satiou in the community. In addition to
ably written articles by prominent citi
zens â men and women â who tiave pre
sented a series of mo-t forcible arguments
in favor of extending the suffrage to
women, a large number of opinions are
presented from leading professional and
business men. A careful inspection of
this list shows that almost every man o
standing in Santa Barbara not only con
sents to the sixth amendment, but enthus
iastically favors it.
All but two of the leading clergymen In
dorse the movement. Almost every one
of the county officials heartily approves of
it. Prominent lawyers and physicians,
capitalists, bankers and merchants and
editors of all but one local paper came out
with strongly expressed opinions favoring
the movement.
RALLY AT RIVERSIDE.
Adjacent Towns Send Delegations of Re
publicans.
RIVERSIDE, Cal,, Oct. 24.â Hon. F. F.
Davis of Minnesota addressed a mass
meeting at the Loring Opera-house to
night. A large street parade took place
before the meeting, the uniformed McKin
ley Club and the First Voters' Club of this
city, as well as the Americus Club of
Pasadena, taking part. San Bernardino,
Redlands and other adjacent towns were
also repre-ented in the parade.
Davis 1 arguments for i rotection were
convincing and his reference to the indus
tries of California was applauded. He
compared the Wil?on and McKinley bills
and showed the advantages the latter gave
to the people. The money question was
also discussed by Davis, "he eloquently
showing up the fallacy of the argument
offered by the free s.lver men, pronounc
ing their theories untenable und unjust
both to the people and the country.
NO ERROR ON THE BALLOT.
Zqual Suffrage Amendment Rightly Dcs-
i-inated the Eleventh.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Oct. 24.â The agi
tation at equal suffrage headquarters in
this city over the apparent discrepancy
between Governor Budd's election procla
mation and the sample ballot supplied to
the committee by the clerk of this county'
has been completely allayed. In the
opinion of loading lawyers here there is
ruuch that was superfluous and irrelevant
in the Governor's proclamation; that the
phrase, "Amendment number six," relat
ing; to the suffrage amenum nt, is useless
and arbitrary. The amendment is prop
erly de-ignated on lhe ballot as '^Assem
bly cons ituuonal amendment Aumber
eieven," and the form of expressing the
voters' will in relation to its adoption or
rejection by the use of the words "yes" or
"no" is proper and legal.
OREGON SNEK FOR McKINLEY
Chairman Hirsch â *Â«?/* the Victory Has
A trendy he-n Won.
PORTLAND, Ob., Oct. 24.â Discussing
the situation in Oregon, Chairman Hirsch
said to-day: "I consider Oregon won for
McKinley. It is entirely out of the doubt
ful list of States and in the McKinley
column. My late advices from all parts
of the State make it certain that the
electoral vote of Oregon will be given to
the Republican Presidential candidate-,
all rumors to the conirary notwithstand
ing. The reports In circulation that we
have given up Oregon are absurd. The
Bryan people started a similar rumor on
Mr. Hanna, chairman of the National
Committee, some time airo. It is a con
certed plaa on their part â a gra^pinÃ at
the last s'.raw. I never felt so confident of
carrying the Stute as Ido now. The work
of our committee extends all over the
State."
LOYALTY A QUALIFICATION.
Federal Judge Hanford's Statement to a
Seeker for Vffic:
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 24.â A letter from
Federal Judee C. H. Hanford in rpply to a
petition of Paul S. Hogan of Mount Ver
non, Wash., for the appointment of Mr.
Weppler as United States Court Commis
sioner at McMurray, this State, was made
public to-day. His Honor in part says:

for making an appointment 1 will not regard
Mr. Weppler as a suitable person unless I am
assured that De is not a supporter of the Chi
cago platlorm or of the candidates for office
who subscribed to its declarations.
Bakersfieia Greets Paeheco.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Oct. 24.â The
Mexican McKinley Club participated in a
grand demonstration this evenine â the
first one of tbe campaign. Ex-Governor
Paeheco was ihe speaker. Previous to the

gathered about the speakers' stand, which
had been erected in the open air and
decorated for the occasion. Among the
decorations was a Mexican flag, with a
huge American flag in tbe background.
Governor Paeheco first spoke in Spanish
and then in English. The ex-Governor's
speech was received with the wildest ap
plause.
Santa Barbara Mystery.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 24â A
mysterious incident has been perplexing
Santa Barbara people for the past two
days. Yesterday morning a horse attached
to a light cart and without a driver, was
seen running through the lower part ol
the town. The horse darted up a side
street and was afterward found under the
â¢Garrillo street bridge, with its legs broken
bo that the animal had to he shot. The
most diligent inquiry has so far failed to
disclose the identity or whereabouts of
the owner or driver, and a conviction is
grow ng that he may have suffered serious
injury and be lying helpless somewhere
by the roadside.
Arcata's Republican Outpouring.
ARCATA, Cal., Oct. 24.â Another large
and enthusiastic audience assembled to
night at Minors Hall to hear Senator

The merchants and manufacturers of j
San Francisco yesterday showed their in
terest in the issue for protection by filling
the Chamber of Commerce to its utmost
capacity. The Chamber of Commerce
cannot afford seats for a regiment, but in
the mater of that quality which poes to
make prosperity, the quality being energy,
industry, enterprise and brains, it can
Mold its own witu the Colisseum in Rome
in the palmy day? when the downward
pointing of the thumb meant death to the
bleeding gladiator.
Nathaniel Stone called the meeting to
order, and introduced Colonel Sumner as
chairman of the meeting. Tne colonel is
also chairman of the parade committee oi
the National Republican League. T.
Carey Friedlander was selected as secre
tary of th- meeting.
The chairman announced that the
parade committee had decided to ha*ve
the parade in the afternoon, because
Thomas B. Reed of Maine was to speak in
Woodward's Garden Pavilion in the even
ing, and a night procession would inter
fere with the meeting. In the evening
there would be a torchlight parade, he
said, of the uniformed clubs to escort Mr.
Reed to the pavilion. The chairman sug
gested that the proprietors of business
firms and factories should march at the
head of their departments.
M. H. de Young, ex-member of the Re
publican National Committee, moved thnt
a committee of three should be appointed
from each branch of industry, which com
mittee should appoint its own grand mar
shal, and conduct its own end of the
parade in a separate division as a non
partisan affair.
The chairman informed Mr. de Young
that Grand Marshal Stone had charge ol
the whole parade.
General John F. Sheehan asked whether
he understood rightly that Mr. de Young
desired to bave two separate parades on
the same day. "I don't see how you can.
have two parades and two committees,"
he added.
Before Mr. de Young had an opportu
nity of answerine the question, it was an
nounced that 400 commercial travelers,
most of whom were Democrats, would
turn out in the procession as McKinley
men.
Charles M. Shortridge suggested that
Mr. de Young's motion that a committee
of three snould be appointed to represent
each branch of industry should be
adopted.
I. J. Truman moved as an amendment
that each trade be called out and that
each trade select three committeemen to
work with the parade committee. The
motion was carried unanimously.
Colonel Btone, grand marshal of the
committee, did not think that Mr. de
Young's proposition of two separate com
mittees would be practicable. They would
bring about considerable confusion.
It was suggested also, in reply to Mr.
de Young's suggestion, that there were
many sound - money Democrats, who
wished to turn out and who would object
to looming a part of a Republican proces
sion.
Charles M. Shortridge said he held
Democratic merchants in the highest es
teem who would turn out and vote for
McKinley. For his part he nroposed to
parade on that day as a Republican, but
it would be asking too much of him and
of every other Republican to take down
the banner of Republicanism and to hoist
in iis stead the banner of the merchants,
especially since the Republican State Cen
tral Committee had given the matter its
support, when Republicans from all the
outlying precincts were to take part and
when every Republican club and every
merchant and every boy that could carry
a flag were to march elbow to elbow for
sound money and protection. It seemed
to him that the sacrifice would be too
great.
M. de Young renewed his motion to the
effect that the representatives of tne trades
have tiieir own marshal.
Mr. Murdoch moved that the represen
tatives of the trades be selected by the
general committee of thirty, and that they
co-operate with the parade committee and
report to Grand Marshal Stone.
The motion was carried unanimously,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
and Mr. De Young was heard to blush
loudly.
Evan J. Coleman arose and said that he
had been an old-time Democrat and that
he had now turned Republican, not for
this time but for the rest of his life. He
marched once in a parade for General
Hancock and he swore that time that he
would never walk on cobblos again. But
this time he was determined to march for
McKinley even if he had to go on one
foot.
Mr. Coleman took exception to Mr.
Shortndge's fervent Republican remarks,
and Mr. Shortridae smilingly said that if
he had offemled Mr. Coleman's Demo
cratic feelings he would apologize, where
upon both gentlemen smiled a Republican
smile.
On motion of Mr. Crocker Grand Mar
shal Stone of the National Lsngue of Re
publican Clubs was indorsed as the grand
marshal of the bus. ness end of the parade
also.
Then the meeting adjourned until to
morrow noon.

SURVIVED THE
ARAGO'S WRECK
They Arrived Yesterday
From Coos Bay on
the Homer.
Hundreds of People Were Down
to Meet the Vessel When
She Docked.
ANOTHER BUN A WAY COUPLE
William Turner and Miss A. Rotten
dorf Married on tbe Steamer
Eureka.
The survivors of the wrected steamre
Arago arrived on the Homer yesterday
from Coos Bay. There was a big crowd
at Howard-street wharf to meet the vessel
as she entered her slip, and there were
many pathetic scenes as the men stepped
ashore and greeted their friends. Captain
Reed did not come down on the Homer,
but will remain at Coos Bay and save
everything possible from the wreck.
Purser McCoilum was among those who
came back on the Homer. He was washed
off the deck of the Arago by a big wave,
but the return carried him back again
and be managed to hold on. "The after
port boat was the first lowered," said he
yesterday. '"Two men got into it and
rowed away. We yelled to them to come
back, but they would not. Later a big sea
swamped the boat and the men were
drowned. The second boat, with the mate
and six men in it, half filled and they
began bailing out with their hats. Cap
tain Reed threw them a bucket and they
got her clear of water. The cnief engi
neer's boat capsized and six of the men
in her were rescued by the mate's boat.
We had a most terrible experience, and
lam more than thankful to be back in
San Francisco."
J. Moore, one of the firemen, was in the
firerooui when the vessel struck. He
began to climb as soon as the water rushed
in. It followed him as 'fast as he could
climb, and he had barely time to jump
before the vessel sank, lie was also glad
to get back to San Francisco.
The lolloping list of men from the
Arago arrived on the Homer: F. Warner,
first officer; A. G. Bank*, second officer;
C. F. McCoilum, pu ser; F. Crogan, first
assistant engineer; F. F.iele, second assist
ant engineer; E. McÃibbon, H. Brown,

Captain Bennett, superintendent of the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company, went
out on the Corona as master yesterday.
He will only make one trip, for as soon as
Captain Hunter gets here with the Uma

Captain Jepsen will take the Corona. In
the meantimp Captain Harry Goodall is
in commana of the docks. Captain Jessen
will take command of the Homer and
Captain. Bonnitield will go as master of
the Eureka, while Captain Conway, late
of the Eureka, will take out the Columbia.
The British tramp Linlithgow is prot>
ably at the bottom of the sea. Yesterday
another telegram arrived stating that she
was sinking when the captain and crew
lei t her. Everybody on board was saved.
Inconsequence the chances are that the
Fearless will be called in when she gets
off the Farallones.
The British ship Adelana got in from
Yokohama unexpactedly yesterday. She
made the run in the very fast time of
twenty-fcur days, and Captain Gillis is
jubilant. The last time became here he
was from Hongkong and the run was
made in thirty-one days. The Andelana
took a negro crew frum New York and
during the voyage there were severe rows.
Captain E. D. Persons of the steamer
Eureka, which arrived from Newport yes
terday morning, bad the pleasure of
launching a young couple on the sea of
matrimony during his trip to this port.
T.e high-sea contracting parties came on
board at Newport, and last Thursday,
when the steamer was off Point Concep
cion, they presented themselves to the
astonished snipper and a&ked for a wed
ding.
Th eyoung man stated that he was Wil
liam Turner of San Francisco, aged 23.
and his prospective bride was Misi A.
Hattendorf ol Denver, aged 17. After
questioning them closely, Captain Parsons
concluded to perform the ceremony which
made them husband and wife. Theydid not
give their fellow-passengers any informa
tion in regard to themselves, and when
the steamer "locked they -boarded a car
and liurried up town. Captain Parsons
thinks the young lady ran away from Den
ver to meet Turner in Los Angeles.
News was yesterday received in this
City giving details of the loss of the
American ship Patrician, which was re
ported some time ago to have foundered
in a gale on the Australian coast. While
the vessel rolled, dismasted and filling
with water in the terrific seas, .she was
sighted by the British steamer Fifeshir
and with great difficulty the officers and
crew of the wreck were rescued and landed
at Sydney.

LOCAL FARES ON
OAKLAND TRAINS
Supreme Court Has Been
Asked to Grant a
Rehearing.
Mr. Buswell Not Satisfied With
the Court's Recent De
cision.
QUOTES THE ACT OF 1861.
Alleges Tbat tbe Position of the Court
Turns a Steam Railroad Into a
Streetcar Line.
E. F. Buswell is not satisfied with the
decision of the Supreme Court in reference
to the charging of fares by tbe Southern
Pacific Company on the local trains in
Oakland. The Supreme* Court decided on
the 6th inst. in favor of the railroad com
pany. Mr. Buswell lost no time in getting
in a petition for a rehearing. This was
filed in the Supreme Court yesterday.
Mr. Buswell, through his attorneys, ca'ls
attention to some facts in the case which,
in his opinion, justify him in asking that
the Supreme Court shall reconsider its de
cision. The petition in opening quotes a
part of the language of the opinion handed
down by the court as follows:
â¢'To forbid the defendant company from
carrying passengers from one point to an
other in the city of Oakland for a con
sideration is not the equivalent of the
declaration that the company must carry
all passengers between these points with
out consid ration."
The petition says that while this was
quite true in the abstract and might apply
in this instance if the defendant did not
have a public duty to perform by virtue of
its very existence irrespective of any de
mand, Iwo parties were interested, the
public and the railroad company. The
latter might take public or private prop
erty for its use and charge for carriage
unless it bad voluntarily givÂ«Â»n up that
right or exchanged it for something else.
The reason was that the railroad was a
public use. Take away the obligation to
carry passengers and the company would
have no right to accept or occupy public
or private property or a franchise or to
exist at all.
The Southern Pacific Company volun
tarily renounced the right to charge by
exchanpine it for a valuable francuise. To
illustrate the claim the petition quoted
that part of the act of May 20, 1861, which
was as follows :
Nor shall any railroad company who may
avail themselves of the provisions of this sec
tion ever use their road for the purpose of car
rying passenger's ior a consideration from one
point to another in the same city.
The railroad company availed itself of
these provisions, and as it was by the act
of 1861 forbidden to carry pass^n^ers from
one t omt to another in the same city for a
consideration it was not necessary to im
pose tbo duty of carriage to ufti'-matively
make a declaration to that end. The duty
was already imposed, and was uelf-ex
istent. The franchise, or right of way,
was given in exchange.
Further on the petition alleges that
"the provision in the section means just
what it sa/sâ that is, that no railr. ad
company shall ever procure a franchise
under this section for a steam railroad
and then degenerate it into a streetcar
line."
It was also alleged that the decision of
the Supreme Court would destroy compe
tition. ,"But the court would construe
this section to cut off iljompetition between
common carriers of passengers and give
one a monopoly thereof." The foot was
set up also that when tne act of 18(31 was
passed there were no street railways in
Oakland. "And we particularly call the
learned court's attention to the fact that
the construction given would prevent the
people of the city (Oakland) from riding
at all on defendants' said line, though
ready and willing to pay therefor."
Another point in the petition was as-fol
lows: "The rights of the public are never

PAST REFORMATION.
Clarence Travers, Alias Charles Harris,
Steals From People Who Have
Befriended Him.
Clarence Travers, alias Charles Harris,
was arrested on Kearny street yesterday
afternoon by Corporal Geimann and
Policeman Heaphy and detained at the
City Prison on the charge of Durglary.
Travers was a bellboy in a downtown
hotei and was arrested about eighteen
montus ago for stealing jewelry from the
rooms of the guests. He was charged
with grand larceny, but tbe charge was
reduced to petty larceny, and on August
21, 1895, he was sentenced to four months
in the County Jail. He had been pre
viously arrested for burglary, but "beat"
the case.
After his release from the County Jail
the members of a church in the Mission
tv^jk an interest in him with the view of
reforming him. One of them was Charles
A. Hohn, 409 Thirtieth street, who took
him home to dinner. Daring dinner
Mrs. Hohn remarked that she was going
to Alameda next day to visit a friend.
This was on October 6. She started the
next day, but had to return, having for
gotten something, and to her surprise
found Travers in the house. He ex
plained that he had made a call, but find
ing the front door locked he had gone to
tbe rear door, which was unlocked.
Mrs. Hohn did not go to Alameda that
day and invited Travers to remain for
dinner, which he did. Next day she did
go to Alameda, and during her absence
Travers entered the house and, it is
charged, stole an overcoat, a gold watch
and chain and a small sum of money.
A charge ol petty larceny will also be
pincpd against Travers. Charles Mingo, a
medium in the Mission, gave him a $5 gold
j,ie. c to get changed, but it is claimed he
did not return with the money.
KILLED HIS STEPSON.
W. J. Price Held for Manslaughter by
Judgo Campbell.
W. J. Price was yesterday held by Judge
Campbell to answer before the Superior
Court in ?5000 bonds on the charge of
manslaughter.
On the night of October 8 Price, who
lived at 42J Precita avenue, was threaten- ;
ing to beat his wile wi.en Edward Edgar,
his stepson, interfered to protect his
mother. Price seized a pair of shears
I aDd stabbed the young man, who died in
a few minutes.
A strong plea of self-defense was made
on behalf of Price, who was charged with
murder, and the Judge decided that the
evidence was not strong enough to con
vict on that charge, so he held him for
manslaughter.
Slipped and Broke His Neck. *
Prosper Keisel fell down the stairs at the
paintshop at 403 Gough street yesterday morn
ing, breaking his neck. Just how the accident
happened no one seems to know. It is sup
posed, however, that his foot slipped just as he
started down the stairs, all of his weight com
ing on ids neck. Keisel was a married man
and lived at 95 Fulton street.
Sent to San Qaentin.
Henry Aitmeyer and Connor C. Lane have
been each sentenced to a year in San Quentin
for grand larceny. Judge Belcher imposed
the punishment yesterday. Immediately
afterward Aitmeyer was arraigned on a second
charge of grand larceny and he will be tried
next week.

WANT TO CHANGE
THE SCHOOL BOARD
That Is Why the Non-
Partisan Pledge Is Not
Signed.
Nomine?s for Directors Refuse
to Let Outsiders Select
Teachers.
BEPIECTICNS CN TEE SYSTEM
The Pledge Demands That Teachers
Bs Chosen by Men Not in the
School Department.
The Non-rartis^n party is having con
siderable trouble over its pledges. Great
anxiety was manifested by committees of i
the convention over the framing of these I
pledges and this, so it is said, has caused |
the framers thereof to step beyond the â¢
mark. Indeed it is held that the pledge :
exacted from legislative nominees is not
quite constitutional.
And now comes another protest against
another pledge, that required of nominees
for School Directors on the municipal
ticket. The same opinion obtains with
jegard to this promise. For which reason
there is, to say the least, much uneasiness
among candidates named by the Non-
Partisans for the School Board. So far
has the feeling gone that some of these
nominees have declined to sign the pledge,
vrbicu is as follows:
PLEDGE FOR SCHOOL DIRECTOR.
Firstâ 'i hereby promise that, il I am elected I
r School Director lor the City and County of
.i-an Francisco. I wili.by my vote and influence,
endeavor to secure the passage and enforce
ment of a rule providing for the appointment j
of a special committee of educators, outside of I
the School Department of snid City and j
County, to examine and pass upon the qualifi- j
cations of all candidates for positions as i
tfachersin this department (excepting those
that by a present rule are appointed without
examinations on account of their excellency
on graduation from the Normal School); and
further providing, that no candidates shall be
appointed except such as are recommended by
fcaid committee.
Founhâ l will not appoint, nor vote for the
appointment of auy relative of mine, nor will
1 vote for the relative of any other Director to
a position in the i&bool Department.
The rules of the School Board provide
for a city board of examination. Section
159 states that this body shall consist of
the Superintendent of Schools and four
other members, resident of San Francisco,
-.vho shall be experienced teachers elected
by the Board of Education. The City
Superintendent of Schools is chairman of
this examining board.
Teachers' certificates are issued and re
newed hy the Board of Education noon
the recommendation of the City board of
examination, in accordance with the pro
vision of the State school laws. City cer
tilicates may be granted without examina
tion to the holders of California life diplo
mas, California, Nevada, Washington and
Oregou educational diplomas, California
Normal School diplomas, California
State University diplomas, when recom
mended by the faculty of tiie university;
grammar grade certificates of any county
or city of California and life diplomas and
State Normal School diplomas of other
States. Graduates of the San Francisco
Normal School shall be entitled to receive
grammar grade certificates.
Again section 165 provides that:
No one shall be appointed a teacher in this
department who is not a graduate of some
normal school, or other institution of learning
nf equal rank, with a regular diploma there
from, or who shall not have at least two years'
successful experience iv teaching In public
schools.
Were the Non-Partisan pledge to be ob
served, however, these lone-established
rules would be eliminated. The apparent
object of the pledge is to have a committee
composed of State University professors,
but this is not specified, and consequently
it remains an open question as to who
these men shall be. Again it is taken as a
reflection on the probity and ability Â«f the
superintendent and principals forming the
examining board; and, therefore, on the
wnole system in San Francisco.
The pledge still awaits signatures, and it
is considered highly probaole that some of
the nominees who have signed will be in
duced to come out with a greatly modified
promise. "
PRESIDIO TOPICS.
tight Batteriei of the Fifth Artillery
Leaveâ Lieutenani-t'olonel
ton Commands the Post.
Light Batteries D and F of the Fifth
Artillery left the Presidio at 7 o'clock last
evening for the East. Battery V, Captain
Thorp, goes to Fort Hamilton, New York
liarbor, and Battery F, Captain Reilly,
goes to Fort Itiley, Kansas.
While the artillerymen were waiting at
the barracks for the orders to form and
march to the steamer McDowell at the
wharf the band of the First Infantry dis
coursed delightful music. Maidens from
the City waltzed good-bys with their
soldier beaux, and so the waiting hour
was passed merrily enough. The men
marched away cheering for California, the
First Infantry and the Third Artillery.
At Oakland wharf the scenes incident to
the departure of the foot batteries were
re-enacted. A large contingent of rela
tives, friends and admirers of the artillery
men went across the bay on the ferry
steamer to speak good- by and shout
wishes for a pleasant trip.
Lieutenant-Colonel Williston, Third
Artillery, now commands the post at the
Presidio. He is the ranking officer on the
reservation and will hold the command
until General Forsyth returns from the
East and relieves Coionel Shatter from the
duty of commanding the 'Jepartment.
Then the latter will succeed Colonel
â Williston as past commander at the Pre
sidio. Colonel Williston occupies the
house in which Colonel Young of the
Fourth Cavalry resided. Colonel Young's
family moved to the house which Lieu
tenant Long ritted up and then vacated.
Colonel Shatter will soon take the house
in which General Graham lived.
Lieutenant J. M. Califf is in command
of Battery G, the only buttery of the Third
Artillery now at the Presidio. This or
ganization was formerly stationed at Fort
Barrancas, Pensacola. and is now quite
well satislied with prospects at the Pre
sidio.

OLD LADIES' BAZAAR.
Tlio Fair at the Protestant Episcopal
Home.
A bazaar is now being held at the Prot
estant Episcopal Old Ladies' Home on
Golden Gate avenue, between Lott street
and Masonic avenue. It is for the benefit
ofthntvery worthy institution, and most
of the pretty articles on exhibition there
ure the handiwork of the aged inmates.
Last evening :i large attendance of visitors
went through the rooms admiring the
decorations, as well as the neat appear
ance of the establishment.
I'lin home is in charge of Sister Alice of
the Order of the Good Shepherd, and is
under the government of a board of man-
UKors of which .Mrs. 11. ];. Sanchez is uresi
umrt. The liev. E. J. Lion is vice-presi
dent and chaplain. The home and its
thirty-three inmates are supported by the
voluntary contributions of the Protestant
Episcopal church.
TWO PUGNACIOUS JACKS.
Young Mitchell â¢ and McAuliffo. May
-- â  â Â h'ngujje in a Scrap, - ,
Manager Groom of the National Club re
ceived a dispatch from Fitzsimraons yes
terday whicn stated that the tighter would
leave for San Francisco just as soon as he
received the $500 expense*.
Pharkey is more than pleased that he
will sooa have an opportunity of proving
to the sporting people of this City that he
is able to hold his own against all comers,
and in case he whirjs Fitzsirnmons, he
says that he will guarantee to ston Cor
bett in four rounds.
"I have my own" way of fighting," said
the sailor, "and so long as I can win by it
I can't see how I would profit by adopting
a more fashionable style."
Sharkey will not go into training until
after he lias completed arrangements with
Fitzsimmons. lie is a little shy about the
match coining off even now that Fitzsim
mons lias consented to fight him.
The Coney Island Club of New YGrk
has offered a purse of $15,000 for a twenty
round contest between Fitzsimmons and
Corbett, but the National Club of this
City does not take much notice of the
offer, as it has all the appearance of an
advertising scheme to boom Corbett' s
circu?.
Jack McAuliffe will go into training on
Monday at Binnken's training quarters
for his ten-round contest with Jimmy Car
roll. Jack is a little bit heavy, no doubt,
but he will soon take off the soft flÂ«sh by
a strict course of hard training.
It is said that Jack has an old score
against Young Mitchell, and the sportinc
fraternity would not be at all surprised
to hear of an impromptu scrapping match
between t-e two Jacks the first time they
meet.
It will be remembered that when Mc-
AulifTe was visiting this C.ty last year, he
engaged in a rough-and-tumble contest
with Young Mitchell in front of Corbett's
saloon. Mitchell swore out a warrant tor
BlcAuliffe's arrest, and the latter has not
forgotten it.
It is to be hoped, however, for the better
interest of the sport that the light-weight
champion and the welter-weight cham
pion will forgive and lorset whatever little
grievances they may have had.
The Dolphin Boating and Swimming
Club wiil hold a grand aquatic entertain
ment to-day at its boathouse. There will
be outneger skiff-racing and swimming
races. The club's annual ball will be held
Tuesday evening.
A MODERN GRILLROOM
An Elaborate After-Theater
Rendezvous Opens To
day.
One of the Most Artistically Arranged
Restaurants and Grillrooms in
the CouQtry.
The Baldwin grillroom will be thrown
open ibis afternoon and evening to the
public for general inspection, and to-mor
row it will begin business.
It is a pretty place, this new grill
room, and something of a revelation in the j
convenience of its appointments.
Besides the two grand entrances on '
Powell street, opposite the Columbia !
Theater, there is an elaborate entrance on |
the east side from the Baldwin Hotel, and
nlso another connecting the Baldwin
Theater with the grill, the bar and the
billiard rooms.
Wherever the eye is directed in thii
artistic and elegantly appointed estab
lishment a new charm appears, each in
itself leading to the completeness of ar
rangement of one of the most modern
grillrooms in this country. The entire I
place is beautifully finished in black wal
nut elaborately carved. Costly plate-glass I
mirrors reaching almost to the ceiling sur
round the room, and the decorated frieze
and colonial relief work on the ceiling is
boldly ser off by a succession of electro
leers.
In the rear, on the east wing, is arranged I
the culinary department, which is ania
tically finished in polished copper, in !
Iront of which is a massive marble coun- i
ter. The barroom, separated from the j
grill by an elaborate screen, has been en- !
tirely renovated and refitted in rosewood. I
carved in most becoming style. Massive I
plate-glass mirrors adorn tue walls on all }
sides.
To the billiard-rooms below the grill- !
rooms, there is a doable stairway of white
marble leading down from the saloon.
Around the billiard-room on the sides,
and separated from it, are arranged a
number of clnbrooms. This new and
elaborate establishment, wnich is under
the management of SL Stone & Co., the
hotel lessees, will answer the long-felt j
want of a grillroom and after-theater
rendezvous on a more pretentious scale
than is probably to De found elsewhere in
this country.
BUNGLING BURGLARS.
Broke Into and Kobbed a Grocery Store,
Then Set it on Fire.
Detective Ben Bohen has reached the
conclusion that the grocery-store of J. H.
Schroeder at Geary and Buchanan streets
was entered by some boys at 5 o'clock or
earlier on Friday morning. Thecrudeness
of the work in pryine open the cash
drawer, whence $8 was taken, and the fee
ble attempt to drill the safe ocen, show
that the thief is a novice.
The attention of a neighbor was called
to the store early in the morning by smoke
that issued from some empty barrels in
the rear of the place. Tne lirs: impression
was that an attempt at arson as well as
burglary had been made, and for a while
the Schroeders were under suspicion.
Thi9 was soon dispelled, as the Schroeders
nave but $2000 insurance on their house
and the store, the valuo of which amounts
to more than $10,000.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
J. J. DWYER ON
NATIONAL TOPICS
Spoke at Length at Metro
politan Temple Last
Night.
Escorted by Ircquois Braves and
Free-Silver Flambeau-
Bearers.
F. D. M'CABE'S RATTLING TALK.
Sacramento's Representative Pleasei
the Peopleâ Quoted Senator
Booth'i Words.
Hon. J. J. Dwyer. Democratic National
Committeeraan for California delivered
the speech of his lire at Metropolitan
Temple last night. Mr. Dwyer was escort
ed to the hall by "a delegation of Iroquois
brnves.
Witfa red fire, rocket^ Roman candles
and martial inusiu the procession entered
the hall by the Fifth-street aoor, headed
by a herald who held in his hand a ban
ner with the familiar Democratic device,
"16 tol."
Uniformed in snowy white, bearing tin
torches, next came the Bryan Free-silver
Flambeau Club, under command of Cap
tain Holcomb.
When Mr. Dwyer appeared on the plat
form he was greeted with cheer?, while the
band played "Hail to the Chief."
E. P. E. Troy, secretary of the Demo
cratic State Campaign Committee, in call
ing the meeting to order said that he had
figures to prove that Mr. Bryan would be
the next President, and that reports re
ceived by ihe Democratic Stale Commit
tee indicated that he would carry Califor
nia by a majority of from 30,000 to 50,000.
Yet he thought all good Democrats ought
to keep right on working for the silver
cause until election day.
After a colored double quartet had en
livened the meeting with some spirited
campaign songs. Hon. K. D. McCabe of
Sacramento, Governor Budd's private
secretary, was introduced as the chair
man of tne evening. Mr. McCabe started
out by confessing himself to be consider
able of a hayseed, and proceeded to dis
prove the allegation by making a rattling
good political sneech, judge.!, of course,
from a Democratic standpoint. He said
he thought would give a
majority for vVilliam Jennings Bryan of
Nebraska.
Coercion was a them* that engaged Mr.
McCabe's attention. He made no accusa
tion that men are being coerced or that
they are in danger of that, but appealed
to all workingmen to go into the election
booth and vote according to the dictates
of their consciences.
Free and unlimited coinage of silver at
the ratio of 16 to 1, without the consent
of other nations, Mi. McCabe said, was
the greatest issue of this campaign, and
he challenged his Republican friends to
disprove this assertion.
Mr. McCabe read from an eloquent
speech made by the late Senator Newton
Booth to show Hint America is old enough
and strong enough to control ncr own
financial r.ffairs.
The Moore Brothers trio entertained j
the audience with a '16 to 1" gong, which !
was highly appreciated.
Cheers greetpd Mr. Dwyer when he was
introduced. He opened his speech by a
few happy remarks In recard to this
being a young man's campaign, and he
was proud to speak at a meeting held
under the auspices of the Young Men's
Free Silver Club. He thanked the Iro
quois Club and the Free Silver Club for
ineir courtesy.
Mr. Dwyer scoffed at the action of
Mark Hanna, who had proclaimed October
24 hs "Flag Day.' He said that no party
had a right to try to monopolize the
American fla?. He believed that the
Democratic party had put most of the
bright stars in the blue held of the rl ag. I
Yet lie wished to give just credit to the
Republican party, and in strict accordance
with historical truth he acknowledged
that the Republican party bad done grand
work in preventing any of those stars
from darting from their true orbits to rush I
like comets into trackless void.
Many of the leading Democratic papery
of the Nation, the speaker said, had been
beguiled by the gold legions and had gone i
over to the standard of MeKiniey, but
there were two papers, the New York
Journal and the San Francisco Examiner,
that had remained true to the Democratic
party. Mr. DwyeT in this connection paid
attribute of praise to W. R. Hearet and
the late Senator Georse Hearst, by whom
those papers were controlled.
Chauncey M. Depew and General W, H.
L. iiarnes were criticized by Mr. Dwyer
for what ho denominated their cheap
abuse of Mr. Bryan. Touching the issu
ance of millions of bonds in the past
eighteen months during a time of profound
peace Mr. Dwyer said that he could not
sufficiently denounce such a course. "But
we are told that this bond issue was made
under a Democratic administration. I
deny it. If the Republican papers insist
on the statement that Mr. Cleveland's ad
ministration is a Democratic administra
tion 1 retort to them that it isan adminis
tration which is supporting Mr. MeKiniey
and is opposing "William Jennings
Bryan."
Combating the theory of the gold
standard, Mr. Dwyer said: "The civiliza
tion of the United States does not rest on
gold, if all the gold in this country should
suddenly melt and vanish in thin air, the
civilization of our Nation would still re
main, for it is founded on the men and
women of the country, not on its gold.
"It is nothing new for the rich men of
the country to abuse the leaders of the
people," said Mr. Dwyer, and he thought
Mr. Bryan had not been denounced as
much as some of the earlier patriots.
Mr. Dwyer declared that the white mail
cars now to be seen on our street*, consti
tuted a menace to the peace and weliiare
of our City. It was an outgrowth of the
great railroad strike two years ago, be
cause there was no real saving of time; it
was an effort to extend the control of the
Federal courts and the Federal army to
the streets of the municipality, all in the
interest of the corporations "and money
powers. He notified the monopolists that
the people would demand tne withdrawal
of all those cars tne moment Mr. Bryan
wa3 elected.
Democrats were urged to avoid ihe dan
ger of voting for the so-called National
Democratic candidates for Presidential
electors. These men had stolen the Dem
ocratic name, not because they wanted to
vote for Palmer and Buckner (MoKinley
is their man), but they hope to mislead
the unwary Democrats of "the State and I
thus filch a few votes from William J.
Bryan.
â¢With an impassioned appeal for the
young men of the country to stand by the
Democratic party Mr. Dwyer closed his
speech amid a round oi applause that
shook the building.

COW KILLING RESUMED.
Health Inspectors Surprised nt What
They Found in Richmond.
Four days ago the Board of Health was
notified by certain persons living in the
vicinity of John Erasmy's market, at 1421
Point Lobos avenue, that the place was a

barrels of bones kept ia a small stable iv
the rear of the shop. *
The place was at once quarantined and
the proprietor ordered to remove the ob
noxious articles. Ue compiled with the
order.
But at the time of examining the prem
ises Deputy Food Inspector Harrijjan took
notice of a cow confined in tiie small yard
between the shop and the stables which
appeared to ba suffering from tuber
culosis.
So Thursday afternoon Chief Food In
spector Dockery, J. W. O'Rourke, the
Boara of Health veterinary surjjeon,
Deputy HarriEan and Market Inspector
Davis visited the place.
The sick cow was condemned by the

hammer, so weak was she. On beiug dis
sected Dy the Market Inspector she proved
to be in the last stages of consumption.
Not only were her lungs badly diseased,
but the malady had extended into the
muscles.

DID JUDGE FRICK EBR?
Appeal Taken From the Setting
Aside of a Ver
dict.
Outcome of BulkheaJing Work Upon
the Oakland Water Front for
Eiscn F. Adams.
Judge A. L. Frick of Alarneda County
on March 20 last set aside the verdict of a
jury in the snic of John A. Townley
agamst Edson F. Adams to recover
$2534 73 with interest and coets of suit on
a claim assigned by Darby Laydon and P.
F. Dundon. Laydon and Dundon were
doing business under the firm name of
Darby Laydon & Co.
According to the allegations set hd in
â¦.he suit, Darby Laydon ifc Co., between
October 28, 1892, and October 1, 1893, fur
nished labor and material on the con
struction of a bulichead along the north
erly line of Oakland harbor, between Alice
and Fallon streets, for Adams, and the
sum sued for was due. A denial was set
up. The jury found for Townley, the
assignee. Judge Frick, in setting aside
the verdict and ordering a new trial, said
that he acted "upon the ground and no
oth(>r that the evidence as given does not
jnstify the verdict as rendered, aud that
said verdict is against the Jaw and the
evidence."
An appaal was taken to the Supreme
Court by Dunne <fc McPike on the follow
ing day, namety on March 21, 189 G. The
transcript on appeal was filed in the Su
preme Court yesterday. The anneal is
based upon the action of Judge Frick in
ordering the verdict of the jury set aside.
The jurors had been polled and all said
that they aereel to the verdict.
The case caused a great deal of interest
in Oakland at the time the verdict was
overturned.

reason failed to appear last night to speak.
The band played, the bonfire burned and the
meetiug came off. but was an iniormal affair.
Vaughan Morgan presided, Joe Hanson sang
and recited and a few members of the club
spoke.

" Berkeley is to be the site of the ideal
...university o! the futureâ the shrine for
the great apostles of higher education.
Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst has given such
. assurance of financial aid that Governor
â¢Budd is convinced that her contributions
to the cause may ultimately reach
$1,000,000. Regent Keinstein entertains
the same view, and is confident that
money in sight from other sources will in
crease the gifts to $4,000,000.
/ Plans of architecture for the great
r/aiversity of the future will now be se
v cured without delay. Yesterday , the
regents listened with delight to the read
ins of a letter from Mrs. Hearst, in which
she sought the privilege of sustaining the
entire cost of procuring plans under the
international competition.
Incidentally she mentioned the other
.day to the Governor her purpose to give
$300,000 to construct two buildings â one a
memorial. The Governor remarked that
this took his breath away, as she men
tioned it as a small amount in the be
ginning of her plans.
The annexed correspondence explains
her position and to some extent fore
shadows her generous intentions:
Palace Hotel, October 22, 1896.
Regent J. B. Eeinsteinâ Deae Sir: Referring
to the conversation I had last week with your
self and Professor William Carey Jones, "l de
sire to say that I am deeply impressed with
the proposition now before the Board of Re
gents to determine upon a comprehensive and
permanent plan for the buildings and grounds
of the University of California on the site of
Berkeley, and heartily approve of the idea. â 
My sou and I have desired to give some suit
â¢ able memorial which . shall' testify to Mr.
Hearst's love for and interest in this State, and
alter having carefully considered the matter
we feel that the best memorial would be one
which would promote the higher education of
its people. And 1 must confess that the ab
sence of a suitable plan for the university
buildings has seemed an obstacle In the way
of carrying out some ideas which we have
cherished.
I feel now so Imbued with the importance to
the university and to the State of having such
a plan that I should be glad to aid in its com
plete and speedy realization. I may also say
- that I am the more anxious for this, as I have
in contemplation the erection on the uni
versity grounds of two buildings, one of them
to be the memorial referred to.
I would therefore suggest that I .be per
mitted to contribute the funds necessary to
obtain by international competition plans for
the fitting architectural improvement of the
university grounds at Berkeley. While I
understand from you that such plans can be
procured foi; about $13,000 I desire to say
that the success of this enterprise shall not be
hampered in any way by a money considera
tion.
1 have only one wish in this matterâ
the plans adopted should be worthy of ' the
great university whose material home they
are to provide for; that they should har
monize with and even enhance the beauty of
the site whereon this home is to be built, and
that they should redound to the glory, of the
State whose culture aud civilization are to be
nursed and developed at its university.
As the full execution of these plans will
probably require a long period of lime, and
one of constant and assiduous attention, I
should like to suggest that this trust be re
posed in a special committee which will repre
sent the several interests involved.
I would name as such trustees, his excel
lency, James H. Budd, representing the St.-.te,
Prolessor William Carey. Jones, representing
the university, and yourself, representing the
Board of Regents. I have the less hesitancy
in suggesting these names, as these gentlemen
are all graduates of the ' University of Califor
nia, ana would, I am sure, be glad to perform
this labor in gratitude to their alma mater.
Of course the ratification of a final plan would
rest with the Board of Regents. â 
I believe that the release of Mr. B. R. May
beck (who has been identified with the idea of
this plan from its inception), from his duties
of instruction at the university, and his
presence in the Eastern States and Europe
would greatly facilitate a proper understand
ing of our design among architects. I would,
therefore, further suggest that he be given a
leave of absence for one or two years, and 1
offer to provide for him a reasonable compen
sation. Yours very sincerely,
Pheobe a. Hearst.
Governor Budd has accented the trust
mentioned in Mrs. Hearst's letter. The
following letter of acknowledgment from
the Governor in behalf of the people of the
State was read to the board :
San Francisco, October 23, 1896.
Mrs. Phizbe A. Hearstâ Dear Madam: Your
letter of yesterday touching an architectural
plan for the University of California has been
submitted to me, and I beg to say that I shall
be happy to accept the trust therein reposed.
Your conception of the purposes of the Uni
versity of California as a great State institution
on the loftiest and broadest plane wherein the
State confers the priceless benefits of â â¢- the
higher education, is as noble as it Is true.
Such was the great purpose contemplated in
the acts of Congress and of the Legislature of
this State founding this universityâ a purpose
whose scope and grandeur have been as
thoroughly appreciated by you as your action
will spread and enforce its appreciation by
others. .
Such a plan as you contemplate will inure
â to the lasting glory and advantage of the Slate
and the State's university and to the infinite
benefit of the people ot the State.
. In the name of the State of California, and
on behalf of the people of the State, 1 tender
you their heartiest thanks and assure you of
their sincere : and lasting : gratitude. I . am,
dear maduni, yours very sincerely,
James H. Bcdd.
In accepting his . appointment as one of
the trustees Regent J. B. Rein stein ad
dresseJ the following letter to Mrs.
Hearst:
San Francisco, Oct. 22, 1896.
Mrs. Phcebe A. Hearstâ Dear Madam: I am
in receipt ot your letter of to-day expressing
your earnest wish for an international archi
u-ciural competition for a permanent and
grand plan of the buildings and grounds of
the University of California at Berkeley, and
also your splendid gilt to further the obtain
xnent of euch a plan. .
Perhaps nothing at this time could be more
opportune or important for the State Univer
sity than this wise gilt and the gracious influ
ence of its donor, through which we may hope
soon to obtain a plan wulch shall contemplate
upon the superb site of this university build
ings in every way worthy of a great State and
its highest institution ot learning. â  Whatever
maybe considered the Important needs and
the factors of success in this university, it is
certain that tney all will be subserved im
â¢ measuraDly by building* which shall- body'
forth the power and the dignity of a sovereign
State, at me same ' time : that they shall exalt
education by the inspiration of glorious archi
tecture, making patriotism and a lofty regard
for the State as certain a result of a course at
this university as a love for what is beautiful
and true. â 
Your thought and kindness foreshadow
such a plan as will accomplish this double
purpose, and in addition will spur the pride
and interest of State and individuals to speed
ily realize that plan m useful, beautiful and
inarmonious structures. "" \ , ,*. â¢ â â .-â ;-â

J. B. Rejnstein.
On the subject of the future great uni
verslty Regent Reinstein grows en
thusiastic. After the reading of the cor
respondence yesterday he said-:
I desire to say In this connection that It Is
expected to a-sk the next Legislature to pay us
the interest upon a loan of $500,000 to the
State by the Board of Regents for a long term
of years, in order that we may apply that
amount to building purposes; and 1 may say
that in my judgment this will be the only
money the State of California will ever be
called upon to contribute toward these build
ings and I am confident, not only that the
sum necessary to erect these buildings will bo
contributed by private individuals, but my
present experience shows that they will strive
with each other for the opportunity.
From all that I have been able to gather dur
ing the year that this plan has been under
discussion, I am justified in stating that if the
State of California will borrow from the board
and pay the interest on #500,000 to be used
for these buildings, and if the plan be such as
to mate these buildings really worla-famous,
which we confidently hope, there will be con
tributed more rapidly than the sums can be
expended more than 's4,ooo,ooo. TMese build-
Jngs. it is hoped, will be constructed only ol
stone and marble, and are to be of such a char
acter as to awaken the pride, not only of the
citizens of Caiifornia, but of the United States,
and to reflect credit not only upon the State,
but on the Nation.
President Kellogg moved that a vote of
thanks be extended to Mrs. Hearst.
Judge Wallace embraced the same sub
ject in the form of a resolution inviting
Mrs. Hearst to co-operate with the Board
of Regents in carrying out the trust. The
resolution directs" the president of the
university to express the thanlis of the
regents for the Governor's gift.
In accordance with the suggestion em
bodied in the correspondence Professor
Maybeck was granted a leave of absence
MRS. PHOEBE HEARST.
for one year. It is understood that he
will visit the chief educational centers of
the United States and Europe and inajce
a survey of university architecture. Mrs.
Hearst is to pay his salary and meet all
the traveling expenses, besides all other
expenses incident to the international
competition of arcnitects.
Competing architects will be provided
with maps showing the topography of the
region of country surrounding Berkeley,
so that they may form an idea of the
scheme in architecture in contemplation.
It is the idea that buildings for centuries
shall be on the lines now to be laid down
by the arcnitect whose plans shail be ac
cepted. Incidentally Mr. Reinstein men
tions the pcss'.bie "outlay of $50,000,000
within the next half century.
To the assembled regents Governor
Budd gave an outline of what he proposed
in one respect to recommend to the next
session of the Legislature. He said: "I
have long been opposed to the principle
of taxing the people of the present to build
for people of the future. Should we now
appropriate $500,000 to construct a build
ing at the university the tax would fall
heavily on the people of this State, who
are now paying or have just paid vast
sums for permanent buildings to accom
modate the State institutions.
"It is my idea in this university exten
sion that the State should borrow the
money of the university and paj T interest
thereon. Instead of making a levy to
Day $500,000 outright we would levy an
amount sufficient to pay an interest on
that sum. As the case stands now the
university lends its money and takes a
mortgage on land â for example, in the
Sacramento or San Joaquin valley. The
land therefore pays no taxes to the State,
as its value is represented in the univer
sity loan. Another piece of land adjoin
ing on whicn a loan from a bank has
been obtained is taxed. There is no sense
in the State lending money to individuals.
I am sure that a loan can be passed
authorizing the Governor, Treasurer and
Secretary to borrow from the university
regents a balf-raillion dollars."
Jude Wallace ODs?rved that there was
nobody the regents could lend money to
who could give better security than the
State officers.
Recent Rodgera said the subject had
been discussed in times past. He was of
the opinion that the Slate would have to
issue bonds. He admitted that the
finance committee entertained the same
views that the Governordid about loaning
money to individuals. Incidentally the
point was raised that most of the money
gis'en to the university was given on ttie
condition that it should not be used for
building purposes.
The Governor suggested that lending
the money to the State would not be
using it for building purposes.
After further discussion the subject was
referred to th~ joint committee on law
and finance. This committee wiii present
a report before the Governor prepares bis
message to the legislature.
At the session of the board yesterday
the recents present were Governor Budd,
Pheips, Foote, Denicke, Heilman, Kel
los-g, Martin, Slack, Reinstein, Wallace,
Miller, Rodgers, Crocker and Chase.
Others attending were Secretary Bonte,
Attorney Mhoon, the architect, and Dr.
Cole..
The first business taken up was the re
port of the joint committee on the matter
of the contracts for building the Affiliated
Colleges. J udge Wallace said {he attor
ney would present tha reDort.
Attorney McLean tfaiu read tbe agree
ment, which was acceptable to tbe Kay
Construction Company and all parties
concerned. In consideration of the rieht
to use rough granite from Folsomat~ls
cents a yard the Ray Construr tion Com
pany will do tha work for $133,500, al
though tbe original price was $143,500.
When this modified contract is approved
by the Governor, Secretary of State and
Treasurer the six other contracts will be
approved. Then the Attorney-General
will approve the execution of the contract.
The agreement with the arcnitect pro
vides that his rescission of his waiver for
fees shall be accepted and that he shall re
ceive for his work a sum not to exceed the
difference in the cost of the buildings ac
cording to the contract ana the sum â
$250,000â appropriated. Under the modifi
cation the cost of construction is reduced
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
by the use of Polsom granite to $239,000,
but expenses amounting to $3000 have ac
cumulated, so the architect is to get his
pay from the remaining $8000.
Dr. Beverly Cole and the faculty were
released from all obligation to pay the fees
of the architect.
The architect at first dissented, as the
agreement did not fully protect him.
A long discussion ensued, in which Mr.
Kroft, the architect, desired some assur
ance that he would be paid provided the
cost of construction exceeded the amount
of $239,000.
Governor Budd insisted that no agree
ment should be made except in writing.
Mr. Kroft said: "We presented our
waiver to avoid a reduction. We rely on
the fair dealing of tfce board to pay us.
The committee was free to accept any
other bids. We have s.nce been misrepre
sented."
Governor Budd â No one has cast any
reflections on your integrity, Mr. Kroft,
We do not believe that you had any de
sign to job the board, bat I am resolved
that we shall have no more verbal under
standings. Everything must be in writ
ing. You will get just what that agree
ment calls for and no more â the difference
between the contract price and $250,000,
less expenses already incurred. You are
the responsible man â the one who got
the board in this position, when we came
near losing a valuable site generously do
nated by the Mayor. The board took your
word that the building, according to your
plans, would not exceed (your fees in
cluded) $250,000. Clinton Day and other
architects said tbe work could not be done
for that money. It is not in your mouth
to complain of injustice, because you got
us into all our trouble.
Mr. Kroftâ You desired a good building.
An ordinary building could be provided
for less money.
Governor Buddâ Did I not point out the
defects in your plans?
Mr. Kroftâ Our plans were as perfect as
any plans presented â as good as any
plans should be.
Regents Rodgers, Wallace, Foote and
Martin par.icipated in the general discus
sion.
Mr. Rodgers said: "Now. I hope the
architect will be satisfied. The board ap
preciates the architect and recognizes his
honor, integrity and straightforward con
duct. The question he should consider is
whether he is willing to take his pay from
what the regents can save of the
$250,000."
Mr. Kroft â It is justice to us that we
should have our money. Have we no
contract^ for work already doner If you
want to throw us out perhaps you can.
Governor . Budd â You groomed this
horse, and if you fed him too many oatjit
is your own fault.
It was finally agreed that the regents
would pay the architects in Installments
as the work progressed. The document
was slightly modified to make it less harsh
for the architect. Then it was accepted.
Mr. Rodgers introduced a resolution au
thorizing the committee on building and
grounds to execute the contracts as mod
ified. â¢
At the request of Regent Martin and
the unanimous consent of the board Re
gent DenicKe was added to the building
committee.
Notice was given that the committee
meetinc to wind up the business would be
held Ht Regent Reinstein's office, Monday
at 1 :30 p. m.
Governor Budd spoke of the neglect of
regents in attending sessions of the board.
He announced that he would exercise his
right under the law to appoint a surcessor
toany regent who should be absent for
three months without leave. Of course ab
sence on account of sickness wouid not
ccuiit against the regent.
DEATH IN THE WAVES
Despondency Causes Captain William
'Anderson to Take His Own V
Life.
The body of William Anderson , was
found floating in the bay yesterday morn
ing. About two ; months ago Anderson
returned 1 , hero and took up his quarters at
the Montgomery Hotel on Second street.
The deceased had been low-spirited for
some time past and made the most careful
preparations for his suicide. Several days
ago he wrote to W. 8. Arnheim, 8 Steuart
street, that he was tired of life, and would
end it all. Friday night he left the Mont
gomery ; Hotel and proceeded directly to
the wharf, jumping into tna bay.
Around the neck wa3 - a handkerchief
filled with rocks. Captain Anderson was
well known along the water front, but r has
been out of work for some time. Brooding
over ; this is supposed to ; have been the
cause of the suicide. The letter to Arn
heim reads as follows: , :â¢
Be so kind as to return air letters that come
for .me to care of A. E. Janson,' 223 East
Thirty-fourth street, New York. I. will jump
overboard from Rosenfeld's dock -to-night I

STERN CENSURE
FOR THE RAILROAD
A Jury Uses Strong Lan
guage Against the
Corporation.
An Inquest Over the Body of
Young Galvary Killed hy
a Mission Car.
DIFFERENT IDEAS OF SPEED.
Many Witnesses Contend That the
Car Was Exceeding Twelve
Miles an Hour.
For severity and earnestness the vÂ«rdict
returned yesterday by the Coroner's jury
impaneled to inquire into the death of
Eddie Galvary, killed by a MisÃion-street
car on October 20, is almost without a*
parallel. While it was shown that the
sad accident was largely due to the care
lessness of the deceased, the railroad was
practically charged with his murder.
On the night of October 20 young Gal
vary boarded an out-going Mission car,
and when a few yards from the Four
teenth-street crossing jumped off the side
nearest the sidewalk. He then attempt
ed to cross the parallel track and was run
down by an eastbound car. The unfor
tunate youth was crushed and ground
into an almost shapeless mass, though
his natural vigor sustained life for a brief
period after the accident.
At the inquest yesterday nearly a dozen
witnesses were examined, and few of them
told the same story. Some affirmed that
the car was running at a high rate of
speed, while others affirmed that tbe
momentum could not have exceeded four
or five miles an hour.
The testimony of the principal witnesses
is told below.
James T. Mantonâ l was on the Twenty
second-street car when I noticed a boy
going across the street and remarked to a
friend, "That boy will be run over." I
saw the car jump and I knew that he was
under it. I did not pariicularly notice the
speed of the car, though I should jud c it
to have bfen about twelve miles an hour.
James Doyle, who was with Manton at
the time, told practically the same story.
James Gallert was sitting on the front of
an outbond car when he saw a boy jump
in front of the other car. That was all he
knew, except that he thought the car was
running beyond the average rate oi speed.
William S. Kirk, who was on the car
that killed the boy, said : "I heard some
body yell and 'hen, looking over, saw the
boy's feet as the car passed over him. The
car at the time was running very slow."
J. M. Leady, motorman â I saw the boy
jump off the other car when I was only
three or four feet away. My car struck
him and I stopped as quickly as possible.
We were not running over three or four
mi os an hour at the time.
J. C. Brandoline said he didnot see the
accident, but was satisfied the car was not
going over five miies an hour. Probably
the most important witness examined was
George Harcourt, the compauion of young
Galvary on the ill-fated rioe. He said:
'â¢Galvary wanted us to steal a ride, but
I protested vigorously at first. Finally we
boarded tbe car, Galvary riding on the
bumper and swinging himself partially
under the car. Just beyond Fourteenth
street I missed my friend and looked
around just in time to see the other car
run over him. I have no idea how fast
the car was voin/."
Tbe other witnesses examined testified
substantially to the facts as above re
corded. Some saw the boy running
toward the track, and oi hers just as the
car struck him. As to the speed of the
car the opinions ranged from five to fif
teen miles. The jury retired, and at the
end of fifteen minutes returned the fol
lowing verdict:
That deceased met his death through
gross negligence on part of the Market-Street
Railroad by not having proper and sufficient
guards or fenders on cars of said corporation,
and by running said cars at too hieh rate cf
speed. L. F. Hader, Foreman.

PLACER MEN WOBSTED
They Are Very Decisively Beaten
by the Alameda Cricket
Eleven.
The Placer County cricketers, who are
visiting this City for the second time,
were yesterday pitted against the Alame
da Club at Alameda. In spite of the very
inclement weather there was a fair attend
ance throughout the day.
Winning the toss, Captain Hogue of the
home team elected to bat. He and Teddy
Hogue led off in great snap? and put up a
century before separating. The 72 of
Hood's was the batting feature of the
match, equaled, perhaps, by Ward Jr.,
who carried his bat for 61. Bird, too,
reached double figures, and when, at 3
p. m., the inning was called nine wickets
had fallen for 232.
; Of this total V he visitors were ,; only able
to get witbin 165 runs. Turner and Marsh-
Browne made the best â  showing, but the
bowling and fielding of the Alnmedas,
aided by their knowledge of the ground,
kept the runs down, alÂ«o she wickets. The
bowling } of Inruss j for Placer County and
a sniart catch of Papa Ward's, at point, for
the visitors were the main features in the
field. .The score, :

STANFORD WINS
FROM RELIANCE
Palo Alto's Football Team
Not Yet Scored
Against.
Hard-Fought Contest With Re
markable Work by College
Linemen.
COTTON A PAETICULAR STAR.
Fierce Game of Many Playsâ A Brother
of Stanford's Great Clemans
Appears.
Stanford has met and vanquished Re
liance. The score was 10 to 0.
The game was remarkable for the great
number of plays, which in itself is an mdi
CHART OF THE GAME.
ThP opening play Is at the top of ihe diagnim. which represents the Central Park grounds as viewed
from the west skie. Morphy kicks off for Stanford from the center of the field down to the Reliance 20
--yard line, and Walton of Reliance carries the ball back within thirteen yards of the centerof the field be
fore he is downed. From that point all the sneceeding movements of the ball are exactly indicated, and
may be followed by the aid of this explanation of signs: A wavy line indicates where the ball i.skickeJ :
a straight line where it is carried: a large dot where it is down with Reliance in possession: a cluster of
dots wher? it Isfiimb'etl: across where it Is down with Stanford in possession; short parallel lines
where the man with the ball is forced bade or tackled back of the rush line; a broken line where It Is
moved by the umpire.
The initial of the player carrying or punting the ball is on the line of Its progress, and that of the
one making the tacKle appears in Instances where a notable tackle occurs M stands for Murphy of
Stanford, AY fcrWMlton of Reliance, Wi for Wells of Reliance, \VI for Williams of Stanford, te for
i-'earixht of Stanford, Sx for Sexton of Reliance, st for Straight of S.ftnford, F for Fisher of Stanford,
Fk for Fickert of Stanford, Ca for I arter of Reliance. Cl for Clemans of Stanford, C for Cotton of Stan
ford, A for Arlett of Reliance, J for Jeffs of S anford, Ja for James of Stanford, H for Harrington of
tanford, L for Lanyon of Reliance, D tor Dole of Stanford.

cation that the teams employed every
moment of the allotted time in Keeping
the ball moving.
It differed from the Berkeley-Olympic
game of the Saturday before in ijiat ihe
two teams were in spirit and ability more
nearly matched. That the iwo lines were
comparatively balanced is shown from
the numerous very slight gains by both
sides on attempted line play?.
What stood out particularly as a notable
feature of the exhibition was the unprece
dented work of Stanford's center rush and
of her left guard in playing well over . the
field and making several tackles. Not
only Uid they outclass their individual
opponents in their line-playing, but they
were often close up on the ball wherever
it chanced to be. Williams, the Stanford
center, in aggressive work and in being
"there" when he was most wanted gave
probably the finest exhibition of a capable
center rush that has ever been seen on this
coast.
Seldom have the bis center men on any
of the teams of the coast been conspicuous
for moie than wheel-horse work at their
regular positions, and generally they have
apparently remained content to stand
tlieircround and repel the line bucking.
That these two Stanford men, opposed as
they were to player." of more than ordi
naty ability in vie heavy Reliance line,
were able often to break through and get
as near to the runner as the lighter and
disengaged backs and ends is evidence
that they played their positions for all
there was in them.
Though the work of Williams and Cap
tain Fickert of Stanford was exceptional,
it was not the star performance of the
game. Cotton, the heavy right tackle,
played and tackled all over tne field, was
good for long gains with the ball, and
showed up so much superior to the here
tofore considered formidable Sexton of
Reliance that Sexton was hardly noticed.
On the other hand, big Bert Oliver, one
of the best guards ever on tne coast, and
Captain Walton at halfback, did efficient
work for Reliance, while little Carter, the
other half, was able to stand a great deal
of hard work with fair success, though
sent repeatedly against the Stanford line.
Stanford had the ball at the opening
kickoff, and Murphy, Palo Alto's new
quarterback, punted well down toward
the Reliance goal at the Market-street
end of the Central Park grounds. Reli
ance soon had it back to the center of the
field, and then began a series of small
gains down to Stanford's thirty-yard line,
where Reliance fumbled. Stanford im
mediately punied for a short distance and
then got the ball again on Reliance's fail
ure to gain the necessary five yards in
three downs. In seven plays, including a
muffed punt, which Fickert got, Stanford
traversed eighty-five yards for a touch
down, Cotton carrying the ball behind the
posts after a gain of nearly twenty-five
yards.
Murphy kicked an easy goal and the
score was Stanford 6, Reliance 0.
Oliver kicked off for Reliance and almost
to Stanford's goal, but little Clemans,
brother of Stanford's great football hero
of '92, ran the ball back and gained on re
turn kick by sending it into Reliance
territory, where it was stubbornly fought
over until the half ended.
In the second naif Dolp, the coast cham
pion pole vaulter and Y. M. C. A. cham
pion all-round athlete, took Searight's
place at left halfback on the Stanford
team, and during tne half James, the
Sianford right guard, gave way to C.
Thomas. For Reliance J. Arlett took his
brother's place at fullback.
During the first part of tne second half
the ball was carried and kicked almost
entirely in Stanford's territory, but later
the collese team succeeded in recovering a
kick sent into Reliance territory, and
after some exchange k'eks got the ball
close to goal and sent Dole over the line
for the second touchdown. Murphy auain
tried for goal, but Walton jumped an-1
touched the ball, which because of the
raise he gave it actually went over the
bar, but no goal was allowed. The score
then stood 10 to 0 in favor ol Stanford.
Another kickoff by Oliver and another
return kick into Reliance territory fol
lowed. Reliance could not gain a foot
and had to give up the ball. A kick by
Clemans and a fumble by Reliance brought
the ball within twenty yards of the Reli
ance goal. In two quick line bucks Stan
ford reduced the distance to only six
yards, when the whistle sounded and the
game was ended.
Stanford had two corps of yellera in the
grand stands, and they made themselves
heard early and often.
The large number of privileged indi
viduals that stood up along the side lines
to the discomfiture of many of the specta
tors was n disagreeable fault due partly to
the leniency of the management, but
largely to the Inefficiency of the several
police officers present who did no service
and got in the way themselves.

varying runs, kicks and struggles, is mdi

Captain Fickert'B Views. ," T
Taking the play all the way through i
think Stanford "had it on" Reliant in
the work of the backs and, as a rule, in
the strength of the line. Our line, 1 think,
equaled ; theirs we could gain ; through
them as they could through us. _ .
: ; Reliance - made some pretty good gams
on end plays with the interference of her
guards. ' So far Stanford has practically
not begun to develop interference bylines
men, and that of the" backs has only re-,
cently begun to form.
The endurance of the Stanford team was
far . superior .; to; that of . Reliance, and 1
think our play was a little sharper. . --â¢-..
As for the individual players, 1 think it
was evident that Williams at center out
played Burnett. James "at ,: guard â ;. held
Oliver pretty well at first,"until be was
laid up. At tackle, Cotton proved him
self far superior to Sexton. He blocked
his man in better, and he broke through
and tackled much of tener than Sexton did.
Harrington, the other Stanford tackle,
was also a little superior to his man.
Our ends, both Jeffs and Straight,
played a good pame, especially in getting
down the field on every punt and in pre
venting many long run. ' ' r
: As for the fullbacks, Ido not think that
the punting on either side was very good.
- Generally .' considered, our interference
was probably equal to that of the Reliance
but neither side had very good interference.
It was very slow in forming and in moving.
The backs on both teams were especially
slow, much slower than the Berkeley
backs a week ago in the game with
Olympic. " .
Comparing this, our second game of the
season, with our match with Olympic in
which neither side scored, it seems to me
that our team has improved in offensive
work, but probably not much in defensive."
Carle, the Varsity guard of last season,
and Soper and Freeman, the two candi
dates for fullback, are on the retired ; list;
so, in addition to Murphy at quarter, we
had James as guard, Clemans at full ; and
Straight at end, eacu playing for the first
time in a Varsity game. â  - â  â¢-' ,'- :
I am, all things considered, not disap
pointed with the work and ; the showing
made by our men. Charles Fickert, â â .
Captain Stanlord Varsity.
Captain Walton Talks.
In the first place, the handling of kicks
on the part of the Stanford players was
against us. In most instances they used
very good judgment in , the. matter -of
placing their kicks, and then, they got
through ( many times, and r either stopped
a return kick or downed our man before
he got very far. .Our tackles were weak,
but the center was exceedingly I'strong.'1 ' strong.'
Reliance did good work in going down on
kicks, but in a number of instances failed'
to hold. Our men allowed Stanford to
break through ; the interference too fre
quently. The ground 4 being: very . soft
tired ' the men and rendered 'fast plays
difficult. Our ends did very well in recov
ering kicks and in stopping runners. The
Chief reason why the Reliance did not
put up a better game is because we have
had no second eleven for r the past two
weeks to practice against. .While we have
as good, if not better, material than Stan
ford, we are not able to get the best out of
it through lack of practice against a good
second eleven. *- *
';; Carter's.work at half was very good. His
playing to-day stamp 3 him as one of the
strongest live-breakers on the coast. Ar
lett blocked kicks very well, but his inter
ference was not up to his average work.
Stanford was very strong , in, breaking
through the line. When we went against
them t .with the ball, they stood firm and
solid, and Williams, at ; center, played the
star game of ' the day for tne cardinal."
Their interference weak, and on ac
count of this many of their runs were
stopped. Taking ; their : general % play, 1
should say that they have shown much
improvement in the last r fortnight, es
pecially with regard to their line.

EXPLANATIONS
The Rev. C., W. Wendte
Defends His Church
and Creed.
Says the Methodists Do the
Liberal Christian Cause
Great Benefit.
DR. KUKMER AGREES TO SPEAK
Anticipates Much Pleasure in Being
Present to Enjjy the Different
Views.
Oakland Office San Francisco Calx.,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 24. j
The announcement of the action oi the
First Methodist Church regarding the
celebration of the inauguration of the
reformation on Luther day has created no
end of discussion amon? both church
goers and non-church-goers in this city.
It is now known that several churches
had refused to join the me^ ting at the
exposition building on Sunday evening.
It was for this reason that the affair was
changed to Saturday evening.
The Rev. C. W. Wendte is not a man
â who will allow any one to question his
Christianity, and when he read the real
reason of the opposition to the celebration
he prepared a statement in which he said :
I w .s heartily sorry to read in the paper of
the purpose of Dr. Rummer and his church to
withdraw from the Protestant celebration of
Luther ami the Reformation' and for the
reason given. His action was foreshadowed,
however, at tne last meeting of the Ministerial
Association, when, to the general surprise and
regret of the brethren, he threw cold water on
the proposed festival and opposed the pro
gramme prepared, not by me, but by the com
mittee, consisting of the Revs. DÂ«s. Coyle,
Bushnell, Jones and myself. In that pro
gramme the Rev. Dr. Rummer was assigned
the invocationâ a part usually not unwelcome
to fervent Methodist hearts. Thinking* how
ever, that this modest representatioa might
not content a denomination so huge and in
fluential as the Methodist, and also fearing
lest my own enthu-i;ism in this cause might
be misinterpreted, I at once offered to retire
from the list in f?.vor of Dr. Rummer or any
other brother. My part was a modest one, to
display certain stereoptieon views of Luther
and ihe Reformation, which 1 happen to pos
sess and accompany thuin with brief explana
tory remarks.
Ihen Dr. Rummer wisely stays away, for the
Methodist church holds theological opinions
to-day that would make the great reformer
turn over in Ms grnve with holy horror.- 1 take
It that to be a true Protestant is rather to
cherish Luther's spirit, as shown in that ueep
respect for the human reason and conscience
which characterized him in his beet mo
meats and underlay his life.
I am at a loss to understand my Methodist
friends. When some time ago the distinguished
Unitarian diviue, the Rev. Edward Everett
Hale, was given a reception la my church, the
Methodist young people came down to our
chapel in a bouy to greet him and give him
the Chnutauqua salute. Now my views of
Christ axe ideutical with Dr. Hales.
In this community the Catholic church has
shown a far more liberal spirit in that it has
Invited Unitarians and Jeus to preside over
â¢ its public meetings in defense of its principles.
Shall Protestants be less liberal than Roman
C'aiho:ies ? Ii a Catholic priest should volun
teer to attend tne coming celebration and pay
a loving iribute to Luiher's character and
universal Christendom, as certain Catholic
writers have done, would not Dr. Rummer I
gladly give him p-rrmission? If lugersoll
should ask the use of his pulpit to deliver a
eulogy on the Bibie, -would he not rejoice to
give him the hearing? Why then does he ob
ject to my reverent tribute to Martin Luther?
It would no more imply that he apDroves all
my private theological opinions than that I
indorse all of Dr. Rummer's because I am will
ing to sit on the same platform with him and
listen to his words.
My Methodist brethren do not appreciate it.
but they have unwittingly done the liberal
Christian cause a great service. In this en
lightened age any display of intolerance
promptly meets its judgment and de.eat in the
minds of the liberally inclined ministers and
people who form the great majority, in a Cali
fornia community, at least. A real. cause for
regret is that the interests of Christian charity
will suffer and the enemies ot Christian free
dom be given another illustration of how diffi
cult it is to unite the divided hosts of Protes
tantism in harmonious and effective activity.
Fortunately for the cause of intellectual and
religious liberty the decisive word in this
great struggle betweeu light and daikness, au
thority and the free reason, tradition and
truth, progress end reaction, will not De
spoken by any church or sect, but by those
great emancipating sciences and arts and hu
manities of our time, which are transforming
all churches and creeds and preparing the way
for a new descent of the holy spirit into men's
hearts.
The Rev. Alfred Kummer explains his
attitude in the matter with the following
Btatement:
I am a very good friend of Dr. Wendte'g, al
though I cannot see how a man of such in
telligence can fail to believe in the divinity of
Christ. My only objection to the celebration
â¢was holding it on Sunday night. In this my
church board agreed with him. New that it
has been set for Saturday night I shall be pres
ent and sjieHk-and anticipate grent pleasure in
looking at the pictures to be exhibited. The
committee in charge asked me to make a ten
minute address, but as the time of the meet
ing is well taKen up, and as I shall speak to
my own people on the same topic the following
evening, I have suggested that they leave my
name off the list of speakers. There are no
differences amongst the Oakland ministers
growing out of the celebration. I have no
quarrel with Dr. Wendte and I hope to occupy
my seat by his side at the next meeting of the
ministers. ___^^__ â _____

The Great Register.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 24.â The Ala
meda County great register is now
completed and in the hands of the
County Clerk, as required by law,
ten daya before election. It con
tains 500 pages and has 25,755 voters en
rolled. The names are exactly alphabet
ically enrolled, as in a directory. It is
printed on 56-pound book paper and wns
compiled by Clerk Jordan without cost to
the county. Heretofore it has cost from
$15,000 to $20,000. I; cost 22 cents a name

BOTH SIDES DISCUSSED.
Strong Arguments Fro and Con on the
Racetrack Incorporation
Scheme.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 24.â The meeting
of the residents of Golden Gate held last
nicht was largely attended. H. B. M.
Miller gave them an idea of the form of
government of a oity of the sixth class and
said they would have five trustees who
would have the appointment of all subor
dinate olficers. He advised a good selec
tion of men for that important office.
The other officers would be a clerfc anjd ex
officio assessor, a treasurer, a marshal and
a recorder. .
John Jurgens, who had resided in the
place for thirty-four year 3. opposed incor
poration. He thought they were well
enough provided for now.
Mr. Dunn said that Thomas Williams
had made an appeal to be saved from the
ministers of Oakland and incorporation
was the method of salvation. He did not
favor it.
J. H. RourKe said: -'I am in favor of
incorporation. The assessed valuation
within the proposed city is $2,000,000, on
which there is a road tax of 35 cents. This
yields $7000, and only a small part of it is
spent in the district. Then th ere is $4000
for licenses. The, taxes on Shell Mound
Park aud the racetrack would add $2500
more a year, mnking $13,500. The town
could run on $1:00 a month."
Captain J. H. McMenomy, chairman of
the meetinp, and S. S. Dewing oppose! the
scheme and chnmea that it would mean
confiscation for the smaller property
owners. Those interested were requested
to l>e present at the m- eting of the Board
of Supervisors next Monday.
Plymouth Brethren.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 24^â The tenth
annu-il convention of Oakland "Believers
in the Lord JeÂ«us Christ" is in session at
Gospel Hall, 574 Eighth street. This is an
old evangelical denomination that is very
little knewn, as it dues not advertise itself
or seek notoriety. It believes in quiet
Christian conduct and acts and the old
truths of the Bible, such as the atonement
â man's ruin â Christ's sacrifice. There
are no salaried ministers, but the members
depend on '"faith" for their living. The
Christians in different parts of California
provide for the needs of these evangelists
when they visit their towns, but it is a
great sacrifice on their part.
There are present here ministers from
all parts cf the coast including Los Ange
les, Portland, Santa Cruz and Sacramento.
â \\ lliiam J. Mc^lure, a very able preacher,
and Mr. Moneypenny, an evangeh-<t,
have been preaching, as well as a Mr.
Arnot, a returned African missionary.
Some of the members are very influential
and highly respectable people of Oakland
and vicinity. This denomination disap
proves of all religious strife and condemns
A. P. Aism. Tho meetings will draw to a
close Sunday evening. Ihis last service
will be in the Y. M. C. A. Hall, at 7:30
o'clock Sunday evening, the subject being
"Christ and Him Crucified."

trouble, while the other was a suxide.
Delia Tnomson and Thomas Wright wer

founa dead in his room was the latter.
He left a note signed Strong, but all
efforts to identify him proved unavailable.
IS SURE OF McKINLEY.
Bert Fraser of Berkeley Bets
Whiskers, Hair and
EyebrGWs.
He Also Agrees to Wheel a Bryan
Man to Oakland in a Barrow
If McEinley Loses.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 24.â Bert Fraser
of Berkeley has a combination of election
bets that would give him cause for ex
treme nervousness were he at all doubtful
of the election of McKinley.
Fraser has one bet with Charles Harri
son, by the terms of which he is to shave
off whiskers, eyebrows and ban if the
Nebraska man wins on November 3. If
McKinley i 3 chosen, Harrison will have
to lose all the capillary substance on his
head and face.
With John Sullivan, Fraser has another
wager, which provides that one of the two
shall wheel the other in a barrow from
Berkeley to Oakland. Mr. Fraser is not
at all nervous over his risk of appearing
whiskerless, bald and without eyebrows,
and wheeling a feilowman over four miles,
but announces himself ready to take more
risks on the man from Canton.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
OPEN ATTEMPT
TO SELL POOLS
Encinal Citizens Aroused by
an Incident on the
Speed Track.
Driving Association Furnishes
Good Sport Despite the Bad
Weather.
CYCLERS' FIVE-MILE ROAD RACE
Rev. Charles R- Linley of Montana
May Succeed Rev. Mf.
Lane.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 24â An open at
tempt to sell pools on the speed track this
afternoon during the races given by the
Golden Gate Park Driving Association, has
created a considerable sensation in this
quiet city of homes, and will no doubt re
sult in some united action by residents to
avoid any person or firm getting a foothold
for future operations.
A San Francisco concern opened an es
tablishment on the grounds and proceeded
to sell pools on the first race, but the nov
elty of the move, or the eagerness of many
to do business, soon gathered such a crowd
about him that the attention of the local
officers was attracted. An investigation
followed and the enterprising owners were
given short orders to make themselves
scarce and not to return under penalty of
instant arrest. The move is the general
topic of conversation.
The races attracted a throng to the track
despite the counter attraction at the Oak
land Trotting Park. Spectators were com
pelled to sit in a cold, damp wind, wnicti
penetrated to the bones, but felt well re
paid when the day's sport closed. The
only accident was the takine off a wheel
from G. L. Smett's sulky by Dr. Leek, but
this was unavoidable and the judges let it
pass. The races were handled well and
were run on time. The events were as
follows:
Four-minute class, mixed trotting and pac

Dear sir: Your reouest to be permitted to
debate the charter with Patrick Riddy under

to a renewal of such treatment by changing
the original purpose and character of the meet
ing to be held on that evening to a debate with

While ihe committee fully appreciate your
loyalty to the cause and are thoroughly con

OPENING DAY AT
OAKLAND TRACK
The California Jockey Club's
Magnificent New
Home.
An Immense Crowd Witnesses
Some Very Exciting
Finishes.
fHREE FAVOBITES IN FRONT.
Rich Inaugural Handicap Captured by
Thelma. a 40 to 1 Shot in the
Betting.
Probably all of 6000 people and possibly
more attended the opening of the Cali
fornia Jockey Club's new racetrack at Em
eryville, a suburb of Oakland, yesterday.
The much heralded tropical weather of
the city across the bay was slightly dis
colored by dark clouds that threatened
rain, and by a cool wind that caused every
one that wore an overcoat to give the hat
and coat check man a wide berth. And
this sudden freak in tne climate! It
caused the oldest inhabitant to look grave
and say he never saw anything like it be
fore. Racing is indeed responsible for
many inconsistencies.
However everything passed o3 as
smoothly as though the track had been
open for years. The climatic influences
acted depressingly or. the fair sex and
their finery, for they could be easily
counted in the stand.
Of the male portion the old-timers were
out in full force, not forgetting kindly
looking Senator Rose of .Los Angeles nor
the venerable sage of the turf, Joseph
Cairn Simpson. Althoueh rushed to com
pletion ana lacking in many instances the
final coat of paint, the grand stand, pad
dock and other buildings presented a*pery
pretty sight, with the club's colors as well
as those of "Old Glory" floating from their
masts, and commanded the admiration of
all. The officers of the club bubied them
selves looking out for the comfort of the
club.
In the judges' stand were Joseph A.
Burke and J. W. Brooks, and their de
cbions gave no cause for contention.
The track while not of the bullet-fast
order was in excellent condition. Sixteen
pencilers posted odds in the ring and
everything went swimmingly with the
talent for the first three races, first choices
stepping across the line in rapid succes
sion, all ridden by Eddie Jones. Then
came the Inaugural and the victory of
Thelma, a 40 to 1 shot, and t hereafter the
"dops" got twisted out of all shape, two
more outsiders winning. It is just possi
ble the layers of odds held their own with
a trifle to spare on the side.
The opening race on the programme was
a six-furlong purse event for all ages.
The crowd landed on Mt. McGregor II
with 107 pounds up as the most likely
candidate and rapped his odds down from
8 to 5 to 9 to 10. Jones, who had the
mount, waited on Quicksilver and Belli
coso until a iurlong irom the stand, when
he went to the front and won in a gallop
by two lengths. Bellicoso got tbe place
cleverly a length in front of Sir Play. Cole
on Grady prooably did bis best, but he has
yet much to learn. McLight showed no
speed whatever.
A $300 selling purse over six furlongs
was the magnet that attracted thirteen
selling platers to the barrier. La Flecha
and Heartsense were the best of the lot,
and they ruled first and second choices
respectively. Red Pike, a rank outsider,
tried to make a sneak or tne purse, but
Jones on La Flecha let out a wrap in the
stretch, and with little to spare got over
the plate half a length in advance of the
Pike horse. Heartsease was third.
Howard S was scratched out of the two
year-old event, leaving a field of seven to

contest for the $350 purse. Alma witn
Jones up was a pronounced choice, the
ring laying no better than even money
against the fiily. She justified the confi
dence reposed in her by winning handily
from Celeste, which latter filly made all
of the running to the stretch. Dolore,
most slovenly ridden by Lew, who allowed
her to drop back almost to last position,
finished in tfle gamest fashion, being
beaten but a head for the place.
The star feature of the event, the $1000
inaugural handicap, followed proved a
very pretty bit of horseracing. Coupled
in the betting Rosebud, with 98
pound.* up, and the two-year-old Cande
laria, carrying 92 pounds, held the
place ot honor, 2 to 1 being offered
against the pair. From fours Caesarian's
price was sradually swiped to 2J4, sending
him out second choice. Nebucuadnezzar
was strongly fancied, but it must be that
the track doesn't suit him. The Rose duo
Tea Rose and Torsinu were welt played,
as was Chartreuse. Tea Rose came very
ciose to turning: a very pretty trick. When
sent away, Pat Reidy astride the filly sent
her sifting along like the wind until she
had opennd up a gap of six lengths. She
did not falter until within a furlong from
the wire, where the others overhauled
her.
Strung across the course as though lined
up at a barrier at ihis point it looked like
10 to 1 and rake your pick. H. Brown on
Thelma was the first to show clear, and in
a hard drive down Ihe line got the brown
mare past the judges first half a length
before Torsina. Chartreuse II was third
lapped on the place horse.
Jockey Joe Piggott is capable of furnish
ing better exhibitions of riding .than he
has been doing of late and it is high time
he discovered the fact. Gayety and over
confidence on his part lost the race to
Little Cripple in the mile and a furlong
run.
The brown horse was a 4 to 5 choice in
the betting, but Piggott let Joe Terry, the
8 to 5 second choice, tret such a command
ing lead in the stretch, that although he
rode a hard finish he was beaten out by a
nose. His defeat cost bettors a small bar
rel of coin.
: ;' As usual the concluding six-furlong spin
saw the! favored ones in the betting en-
KUifed. Salisbury II was a warm 1 2 to 1
favorite around .post : time, while Sea
Spray, ' Howard and Sir Richard had a
strong following. " Coming ou from r sixth
position at tbe start, : Tommy Butler on
Encino, a 10 to 1 shot, made a magnificent
ride, and snatched the race from the coals
by ka ." neck, in a luxious drive \ with Sea
Spray.

BIG ADVANCE IN
HIDES AND LEATHER
Lewis P. Wiel on the Rapid
Rise and Renewal of
Confidence.
He Says It Is All Owing to
Belief That McKinley Will
â¢ Be Elected.
RISE OF THREE CENTS A POUND
Shoes Advance Frcm Fifteen to
Twenty Per Centâ Sentiment
in the East
Lewis P. Wiel, of Buckingham & Hecht,
returned here yesterday after several
months' absence in different parts of the
East. Mr. Wiel says there has been a
very steady advance lately in the price of
hides and leather, and the advance, he be
lieves, is wholly attributable to the con
viction among the people that McKinley
will be elected.
For a good while it was a matter of
doubt what the campaign might bring
forth. Business was generally unsettled.
Everybody was afraid to make a move.
In no business was this more noticeable
than among people handling hides and
leather.
The tanners were afraid to run their
tanneries for fear they could not get rid of
the leather. They were right, too, for the
dealers had no demand lor them. Tue
manufacturers, with whom business was
alow, gave only Buch orders as were
necessary to supply twmporary necessities.
"Now, all this Is changed,'' said Mr.
Wiel yesterday, "and it is v most >:ratify
mg condition ol things. The leather and
hide trade has laser, a new lease of life.
Everybody in the business in any way at
the present time is busy.
"Hides have advanced Irom 3 to 4 cents
a pound and soleleather has also gone up
frcm 3to 4 cents. All kinds of leather, I
may say in a general way, have advanced
from 20 to 40 per cent. Shoes iiave ad
vanced from 15 to 20 per cent. This is all
because there is now a uemand that did
not before exist. Confidence is now par
tially restored.
"This is undoubtedly because there is a
belief over the country, which has also
taken root among business men, that Mr.
McKinley will be the next President, and
that we are to have a solid, stable Govern

ment. This is tne belief all over the Ease
where t 'l have been, and in many of th
States of the West.
"Every railway man I met was a Mc-
Kinley man. They are over the country,
I think, nearly unanimous for him. As
lor the merchants they are all for sound
money.
"I was in Maryland, and there I found
everybody shouting for McKinley. There
is no doubt about that StP.te. It will go
bi-^ for McKiniey. I saw many men in
New York who wanted to bet that the
Empire State would be for the Repu blican
Presidential candidate by 250,000 ma
jority.
"All through the New Eng'and States,
of course, the people are for McKinley in
overwhelming number-;. Oat West, as I
returned, it was the same way. I was ia
Chicago during the recent great parade,
and naw 100,000 men in line for the Re
publican ticket. They were mostly labor
ing men, too. Illinois will go strong for
MrKinley.
"While on my way East I was in Col- '
orado, and was then told that a man
couldn't even say he was a McKinley man
there, so intense was the feeling. When I
came back I was assured that since then
several large McKinley clubs had been
formed in Colorado and that the sentiment
had changed largely. It is so all over the
country."

GRAND JURORS
FIND MANY BILLS
Seven Indictments to Vin
dicate Judge Heb
bard.
The People's Bank Committee
Must Answer for Its Late
Circular.
BANCROFT PLATES IK COURT.
Arrest of ths Teamster Who Helped
Carry Away Valuable Property
In the Night
Fburteen indictments were presented to
Judge Slack by the Grand Jury yesterday
morning and Clerk McElroy was ordered
to place them on the secret file.
Seven of the indictments wete against
persons who recently issued a circular de
nouncing Judge Hebbard for taking the
management of the People's Bank out of
the hands of those who had control of it
when it collapsed.
The persons indicted are T. H. Mc-
Carthy, E..F. Kendall, Thomas S. Wil
liams Jr.. George B. Conant, Benjamin
Lucy, A. L. Casanaro and T. H. Orral
man.
The graveness of the offense charged :
against the depositors is that they libeled
Judge Hebbard in their circular denounc
ing him as an "unfair and unfit" person
for Superior Judge. The circular narrates
the proceedines concerning the bank and
avers that Judge He b bard's course caused
a loss to the depositors. -
John F. Smith and Paul A. ft.yhens, who
presented a Citizens' party petition to the
Registrar, were indicted for perjury and
forgery, the claim being that they stuffed
the list by forging a number of names and
swearing that'they were genuine.
Another indictment was against Wil
liam Robles, charged with perjury, and
there were other minor indictments j
against John Ellis, for stealing a watch, !
and against one or two small offenders for
like crimes.
John Jacob Hoff. a well-known team- j
ster, was arrested late yesterday afternoon J
for grand larceny and burglary, on an in- |
dictment found by the present Grand
Jury. The offense charged is that Hoff,
in collusion with a well-known employe
of the Bancroft Company, conspired to
steal and carry away a number of plates of
books, the object of the burglary being to
sell the material at pound rates for metal.
Back of the indictment and arrest there
is a sensational story that implicates a
well-known citizen, and it is probable that
his arrest may yet follow, but his name is
at present a mystery.
Seen at cell" 7 at the County Jail last
night Hoff said:
"Another arrest is expected soon, but
UDtil it is made I have nothing to say.
A3 nearly as I can understand matters
they chiefly desire to retain me as a wit
ness, and it is to me inconceivable that
anything very serious is meant."
The men indicted for libeling Judge
Hebbard called at the police station last
night and surrendered themselves to De
tective Bainbrid-ge. They were booked
whereupon they presented orders of re
lease signed by Judge Slack, in bonds of
$500 each.
The indicted men, together with many
associates, will call a mass- meeting on
Thursday or Friday night for the purpose
of emphasizing their position. They !
say they did not act in collusion with any
body, and were in no manner conspirators,
but that they acted honestly, as they be
lieved, without malice toward any one.
E. F. Kendall of the committee sends â¢
the following to The Call:
Editor GdU: Your issue of this date states I
that I testified before the Grand Jury yesterday j
that I signed the circular "under a misappre- i
hension of its contents." I testified to noth- j
ing of the kind. Members of this committee
are not controlled by any one.
Â£. F. Kendall.
San Francisco, Oct. 24, 1896.
It is the purpose of those indicted to
rally the anti-bank sentiment in their
favor and make a hard fight to show that
there was no libel in what they wro'e and
that their conduct was without malice.

ARTIST THE GUEST.
Banquet in Honor of Krnest C. Peix
ottoâA Tribute in
Silver.
Ernest C. Peixotto, surrounded by fifty
of his friends in the redroom of the Bohe
mian Club, last evening received a de
lightful send off. The young artist, whose
work is attracting much iaVorable com
ment, has decided at the suggestion of the
Scribners to establish his studio in Few
York.
The banquet last evening was designed
to express in some degree the club's ap
preciation of his merits as an artist and
nis good qualities as a companion. Dr.
George Chismore, president of the club,
presided. Songs, speeches and wine made
the hours glide.
After the dinner in the redroom there
was an informal assembly in the green
room. Uncle George T. Bromley was com
missioned to perform the pleasant duty of
presenting to Mr. Peixotto a silver charing
dish of exquisite beauty. Fac-similes of
many signatures of fr.ends of the
artist were engraved on the cover. Uncle
George suggested that this chafing dish
might be the only fireside the artist would
ever have while cooking* his own meals
and painting for fame and posterity,there
fore he was advised to cherish tne precious
CHANGING THE BOOTHS.
Interested Parties Are Causing Regis
trar Hinton Much Perturbation
of Mim!.
Complaints of the action of interested
parties in moving election booths con
tinue to come into the Registrar's office
and a force of men is kept constantly ta
work carting booths back to their original
stations ana repairing the damage done
by vandals.
The most bold-faced effort to defeat the
object of locating election booths away
from saloons occurred yesterday.
The location of the booth in the Fifth
Precinct of the Thirty-sixtn Assembly
District was fixed at the intersection of
Dolores and Doriand streets and it was
supposed that it was erected there. Yes
terday it was discovered that it had been
built at Eighteenth and bancuez streets
and an investigation of the map in the
Registrar's office showed that the pin that
represented tae site of the booth was
located there.
The clerk's book, however, called for a
booth at Dolores and Doriand streets, and
a close scrutiny developed tiie fact that
the pin bad been takeu from the place
where it had originally been located and
placed on the line of Sanchez street. As
the booth was mysteriously carted to tne
same place, it is believed that the same
person engineered both schemes.
Notices tiave been received from the
police that the booths at Valencia and
Twenty-first sireets.Valencia and Twenty
second, Waller and Webster, Union and
Stoctton, Fourth and Brannan, Twelfth
and Mission, Seventh and Bryant and
Eleventh and Howard have been dam
aged, doors and windows having in many
cases been broken or carried away.
BUILDING BAY GOATS.
An Important Line of Trade
in San Fran
cisco.
A Large Corporation That Has Started
Here Under Most Auspicious
Circumstances-
The San Francisco Launch Company, a
new and important enterprise, has just
been inaugurated in the City at North
Beach for the manufacture of boats and
pleasure yachts on quite an exten
sive scale. The company has been estab
lished for many years at Seattle, Wash.,
where they have built many of the largest
and finest easoline launches and sail and
steam yachts afloat. While at Seattle
this company built the celebrated launch
Ludero for Millionaire Fair of this City.
They also constructed the Claud Haw
thorn, one of the largest crafts of its kind
nfloat. Besides a number of launches for
use on Puget Sound they built two addi
tions to the Alaskan fleet this year, and in
asmuch *as gasoline launches are begin
ning to supersede sailboats for service
aloug the indented Alaskan coast tiie San
Francisco Launch Company expects to
build a number of such crafts for Alaska
people next year.
This important establishment surely
opens up here tinder the most favorable
auspices.
Their large building at North Beach cov
ers a full 50-vara lot and they already
employ from twenty to thirty men a day.
The entire lower floor of the building is
given up to the construction of canoe?,
shells, yawls, ship boats, salmon and
other hunting boats and launches. Around
the upper portion on the inside is an ex
tensive gallery, where samples of all the
styles of their work may be seen on dis-
play. In the eastern wing of the building
are the offices and draughting-rooms,
where their plans are all worked out
theoretically.
On the beach at the end of Powell street
are their ways, where pleasure yachts,
both steam and sail, are built. In short,
they have the largest and most complete
boat building plant on the coast R. I.
Engelbrecht is the manager of the com
pany, and is well and favorably known in
this City and all along the coast for the
excellent work his company has done
while in Seattle.
Thrown From His Horse.
Policeman Robert Lean was riding a horse
on Van Ness avenue yesterday afternoon, and
at Bush street the horse "bucked," throwing
Lean to the ground. He was dragged along
for a few yards, but managed to extricate his
foot from the stirrup. He was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Fitzeibbon
lound that his lert shoulder-blade was broken
Â«nd he hud a lacerated wound in his scalp.
His injuries were attended to, and he was Bent
to his home, on Fourth avenue.
The carpet in Queen Victoria's private
railway carriage cost Â£150. The curtains
are hung upon silver poles, which are sus
pended upon small gilt figures, which cost
ten guineas each. The door handles cost
Â£150. The whole saloon cost Â£6000.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
POLK STREET IN
A GLARE OF LIGHT
Rattling Celebration of the
Arc Light Illumi
nation.
The Improvement Club Carries
Out Its Scheme With
Eclat.
MUSIC AND FIREWORK DISPLAY
A Telling Illustration of What En-
ergy ani Intelligently Directed
Enterprise May Da
Polk street is all right.
This public statement is made in an
swer to an inquiry scrawled upon a trans
parency and which in a setting of red tire,
bands of music, a marching multitude, a
howl of tin horns, dancing clowns and
maskers, swinging festoons of Chinese
Scene at the Jollification at Polk and Sacramento Streets*
lanterns from the store windows and awn
ings on each side and overhead the long
line of dazzling arc lights, a small boy
carried under the eyes of the people up
and down that thoroughfare, from Sutler
street to Pacific avenue.
The celebration of the first electric-ligdt
illumination of Polk street last evening
was a wide-open success. It illustrated in
a remarkable manner what united effort
and intelligently directed enterprise may
do. It demonstrated that while Market
street may be the main artery of the City
there are others â or at least there is an
other.
From the hour the electric current was
turned on until nearly midnight last
night. Polk street, within the limits named,
throbbed with life and excitement.
The red glare of Greek lire painted the
outlines of buildings and lit the Bky for
the length of the thoroughfare, while
music and fireworks ran riot up and down.
The celebration marks the realization
of a dream of the Polk-street Improve
ment Club, organized less than two
months ago. Arc lights have been swung,
three in each block, for six blocks, from
Sutter to Vallejo street. They put a new
face on the street at night.
The memberÃ of the club, merchants
and property-owners pay for the improve
ments by asses sment.
While the nurlyburly was going on out
side the club held a meeting at Lodge
Hall on Polk street, corner of Sacramento,
addressed by Dr. Williams of the Board of
Health, Benjamin Fehnemann, Nathan
Bibb, President Kohn and F. \V. Dohr
raaim. The speeches were all congratu
latory and touched upon the general and
great benefits to be accomplished by im
provement clubs.
The political candidates did not lose the
opportunity and were present at the meet
ing, while their bell-wagons -added to the
clamor in the street. The Letter-carriers'
band took a prominent part in the demon
stration, and every shopkeeper felt it a
duty to burn more or less gunpowder.
Colonel Will E. Fisher bought great
strings of firecracker?, which he burned
irom the top of the telegraph-pole at the
corner of Sutter and Polk streets. He
sent a small boy to the crossbars where
the strings were fastened.
The lower end being lighted, the ex
citement spread about the community un
til the street was blocked and traffic sus
pended. In the midst of it a policeman
rushed in and demanded to know of Mr.
Fisher who was responsible for the hub
bub. Mr. Fisher did not know. "Well,
do you know if he got a permit to use the
telegraph pole in this way?"
"Indeed 1 do not," said Mr. Fisher, dis
interestedly.
"Then I'll have to stop this," cried the
policeman, with growing excitement.
"Very well," said Fisher, "that's the
thing to do. Stop it."
The policeman looked up.
By this time the crackers were snapping
half way up the pole toward the cross
bars, far out of reach. The policeman
glanced upward and then made his way
through the crowd, which was now laugh
ing at his discomfiture.
The celebration was organized and thus
successfully carried through by the sub
committee of the club on electric light
two men, Valentine Schmidt and John O.
Quinn. They were, of course, cordially
assisted by tiie officers and every member.
The officers are : L. H. Kohn, president;
Nathaniel Bibo, first vice-president; John
E. Quinn, second vice-president; Major
Robert Moss, secretary; G. H. Roberts,
treasurer.
The reception committee at the lodge
ball waa composed of John ODea, Alex
ander Mann Jr., Charles E. Anderson, R.
Ferror, H. Galey, Dr. T. B. DeWitt, Dr. E.
Miles.

GAVE A MORTGAGE.
The Architectural Ironworks Secures
Its Creditors Against Possible
L,osg. â¢
The Architectural Ironworks, of which
O'Connell & Lewis are the owners, has got
into financial difficulties.
The firm executed and recorded yester
day a chattel mortgage on its belongings
for $19,000, which was placed in the hands
of W. R. Bissell, James V. Powers and E.
N. Harmon, as trustees for the creditors.
While the affairs o{ the firm are not in
good condition, it is supposed to be far
from insolvent, and it is thought that a
careful handling of the business will soon
place them on a solid basis.
James Madigan sued O'Connell & Lewis
in the Justice Court yesterday for $34 for
services rendered.

HON. J. W. FOSTER
ON THE ELECTION
He Says McKinley ' Will
Undoubtedly Be the
Next President.
California Should Emphasize
the Importance ot Pro
tection.
BRYAN A YOUKG ENTHUSIAST
Never Had Any Law Practice to
Speak Of and Made No Success
as an Editor.
The Hon. John W. Foster, who arrived
here on Friday and will sail for Honolulu
to-day, has decided opinions in regard to
the present election.
His State is Indiana, though he has
been residing in Washington for some
years while making a specialty of cases of
international law. Speaking about Indi
ana and other States yesterday, he said:
"I spent about ten days in Indiana on
the way out. We are having a fight there.
We always have. But this year the Popu
lists and Democrats have combined.
However, that won't make any difference.
We will beat them anyway. By how
much of a majority will we carry the elec
tion? That is hard to say. I don't pre
tend to know. Some say 25,000 or 30,000.
But we are going to carry it.
"And we are going to carry the country
for McKinley. My only anxiety now is to
see whai California is going to do. The
State ought to be for McKinley by an over
whelming majority.
"No other State needs protection so
much as California. The varied products
you have here attest this. California has
many Republican friends in the East, who
would be sorry to see the State go for the
Democratic party.
"I was in Chicago on my way here.
There they were very confident and enthu
siastic. Chicago is go ; ag to give McKin
ley a greater mnjority than any other man
ever received there.
"Everything in lowa is favorable, too.
I met a very intelligent gentleman on the
train who was from Minnesota, and he
told me there was no donbt Hbout that
State, that it would be for McKinley by a
rousing majority.
"I have not heard Mr. Bryan, bat I
understand he holds his audiences well.
He is an eloquent talker, but that is all.
He repeats himself over and over, and is
in short a young and inexperienced en
thusiast. He has never made a success of
anything, and what the Democratic party
wanted to uut him tip lor I cannot imagine.
There are able men in the party, even
among the silver men, but of course there
are more among the pold Democrats.
"Bryan never had any law practice to
amount to anything, and didn't make a
success of it. Then he tried newspaper
work, and from what I am informed
didn't make much of a success of that.
He is simply a young enthusiast.
"His judgment is not matured, and he
is not the right kind of a man for the
place to which he aspires."
Mr. Foster has bad a number of promi
nent callers since his arrival. He and Mrs.
Foster will spend several weeks in Ha
waii, where Mr. Foster will combine
business with pleasure. He will not ex
tend his journey to China and Japan.

The present harrowing struggle of our
freemen of this City to govern our
telves and our neighbors isÂ» by no means
fully described in tbe news columns of the
daily papers, wherein are recorded from
day to day souie things that some men
r.iy and the output of some political meet
ings and somo political clubs and some
[K'litical cabals.
If yon owned a few shares of Union
Iron Works stock the facts of the daily
progress in making ships and machinery
â would interest you much, but you might
find another kind of interest in the Union
Iron Works if you just strolled into them
and reflectively watched the great roaring |
furnaces, the noisy shops, the thundering i
hammers, the grimy toilers, the growing |
Ihips and all the picturesque things and I
. ioings that would not be described in an
annual report.
A political campaign is about the most
picturesque thing that human life gets up
for the instruction and delight of people
with eyes, and it is crammed full of
charming mysteries. But you are not apt
to see the pictures or note the mysteries
If you are a politician yourself and are I
down there helping kick up all that dust
You must go up a tree and feel safe,
Dhilosophicai and good-natured to really
lee tne vast Donnybrook fair and know
what is really gong on.
Tho other evening I called on some
friends whose rooms are delightfully situ
ated just above a bu^y downtown corner.
This busy corner, with the aid of an easily
: opened window, supplies the domestic
circie and its guests at any dull moment
with assorted distractions of street life.
At the time of the said call the goings
r . .in which allured to the open bay-windows
mainly concerned the present misunder
standing about what is going to happen
on November 3. The entertainment was
quite worth the foggy price, though only
. now and then one came out of the human
streams that passed below and heeded
anything in the scene.
There were little eddies about the sides
of the human current caused by sundry
efforts to persuade people who were
'abroad that night, and tbe air was jammed
with sounds. Two fakers were responsi
ble for two bunches of men and a share of
the bedlam, and the Salvation Army
noisily and nobly invited to still waters,
but the campaign gave especial prosperity
to the racket, for it had brought to tbe
nic:ht-life of the old corner some noisy
things that the campaign always brings to
that old corner and to some other old cor
ners just once in two years. They were <
picturesque side features of the operation I
of popular male suffrage. They were j
some of the fantastic things that bienni
ally trouble a few autumn nights and van
ish with the fever.
Some of them were political meetings j
-. that were not reported in the papers next
. day. They were small in size, but size
isn't all there is to a political mpeting.
Torch flames by the speakers threshed the
air in an excited way, jerking weird lights
and shadows across human faces, while
the night wind spun tarry smoke into j
people's faces from their eager tips. The !
speakers were trying to be torches, too, j
and they threshed about in an excited
way, jerKing weird lights and shadows
across some human things, while smoky
seemed the spinning from their eager
* tongues.
The street harangues flew up to the
window in little chunKs as voices rose and
. fell, competing with each other, with
cheers and jeers and with the general
racket. Little chunks are all yon want of
political speeches any way, unless you are
very earnestly seeking the all-truth.
"When I'm elected Mayor you won't !
have to put on a boiled snirt to speak to
your servant. You'll just walk right into
your own office and talk to your slave
while them fellows in the plug hat waits."
["Hoora-ay."]
The window had opened just in time to
receive this treasure. It came from the
strident mouth of a cray-headed man,
who stood above a crowd of fifty people,
on a platform, under a plug hat and be
tween two torches. The gray-headed man
lowered his voice and arm in awful earn
estness, and gave a fair chance to another
message that came with sonorous power
from two rods further up the street, where
another orator, with harsh modulation,
proclaimed truth and duty to a knot of
citizens.
"What, my fellow-citizens, will become
then of the people on Nob Hill and the
people in the slums? Don't you see that
. they will be wiped off the face of the
carth â as classes? 1 '
This being highly important if true, my
attention took guidance from my ears and
noticed more closely that two torches
seemed to reveal that tbe speaker on the
box was a plain workingman arho was
honest by his face, exceedingly in earnest
by his manner, and by his words deeply
. versed in social and political- science and
possessed of the solution to the problem
of human misery. The torches lighted
the sign, "Socialist Labor Party," and the
drawn face of the humble man who loyally
held up the big card on a stick. There
were more plain workingmen going about
the edge of the crowd giving and selling
Socialist literature, and that little particu
lar knot seemed very interesting, not alone
because of the torches, the workingman
on the box, the odd sentences, the human
faces and the glare on the crowding few
that listened, but also because there was
there an earnest human effort, right or
wrong, and because there was in operation
a political force that is slowly swelling its
power and with which the future will
seriously reckon.
The gray-headed man roared and ges
ticulated on as he talked for himself, the
workingmau's voice rose and fell as, he
talked on for his cause, a patrol-wagon
rattled up to a corner and ended one bit
of brief excitement, and a lassie's clear,
sweet voice suddenly sent "Oh, Receive
Him" out to compete with tbe shoutings
of fakers and orators amid the eternal din.
From my safe perch above I could see
and hear all that was going on in the
complex scene, but people down below
who wanted to see and hear one speaker
had to jostle their way into a bunch of
people and reach inwerd with their heads.
Tdis readily suggests the advantage of an
elevated view of politics.
CANDIDATE BAILEY MAKING HIS FIGHT.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
WHAT CAHILL SAW ABOUT THE. POLITICAL BONFIRE.
"Whizz!" went upward a hissing rocket
from two blocks down the street, some
red fire flashed rosy glory on the big
buildings and a band's clashing and toot
ing suddenly charged on the near-by mob
of sounds. People ran into the street and
the orators were forsaken for the minute
for the chief glory of the political cam
paign, the street procession, had come.
By the rockets, the red fire and the tri
umphal music, there was showy grandeur
in the coming scene which was expressing
the ardor with which patriots of some set
were savinc their country. We all love
the political procession and the rockets
and the red lire, and the boy in the red
lire wagon doesn't realize what a power he
is in settling the tariff question. It Is
highly important to scare the other side,
to make your own friends fierce and keen
and to lure tbe weaklings with shouts and
pomp of victory.
But you can't measure a political pro
cession and some other things by the
rockets. This one came into view in a
minute and there were thirty people in it.
A famous Democratic club was escorting
to the hall the honorable champion of
free silver, who voted for sound money in
the Chicago convention. That proces
sion was typical, however, of the proces
sion of Democracy in this campaign.
When the procession passed the dema
gogue who was talking for an office and
the workingman who was unselfishly
Ingenuity and Election Cards.
talking foi a theory went on with their
meetings side by side. The demagogue
and the honest man are side by side else
where among the horde of candidates.
Both are strong elements of the picture
you get when up the tree, and there are
queer kinds of both.
Those little street meetings were pictur
esque for what they presented to the eye,
and then they were picturesque for their
meaning as human efforts. You'll find
such little street corner gatherings all over
the City these nights, and they are
mightily entertaining and worth heeding
at times. .
There is a picture for a Rembrandt at
the Mint steps almost any night. This
famous old rostrum is the free forum of
the people as were the steps of Athenian
temples once, and they have heard a vast
amount of assorted indignation, wisdom
and foolishness from citizens since
tbe old granite pile began to weather
many years ago. If you go there one of
these evenings you will find a knot of peo
ple in the glare of about two smoking
torches, and just behind the speaker a
great sheltering buttress that towers above
the little meeting and looms strongly out
of the darkness. If you look you will see
how the shadows lie and lurlc and blacken
about the massive portal and in the faces
and in the light of the torches and in the
attitudes you may see a study of light and
shade such as you have seldom been on
canvas.
And then you may study it from the
other view, and may find it interesting to
hear what it is the reformer is preaching,
what sort of people are interested in it all,
what wrongs of the people are being can
vassed and what manner of political
science is being expounded.
Not the big mass-meeting at Metropoli
tan Temple, which is reported at much
length in the papers, out these street meet
ings and especially the little campaign
gatherings in small halls throughout the
City, are the ones that count, as far as
meetings go, in the municipal and legisla
tive campaign. These district meetings
are just now dotting the City with their
bonfires every evening, as you note from
up the tree, from where, too, you can see
an army of 200 candidates accompanied by
friends scurrying from one- to another
from early evening until midnight.
The audiences come from the immediate
neighborhoods and they give the local
candidate a chance to get in his work. He
takes his place on the little stage of the
little hall along the water front and finds
eight or ten other candidates there with
him.
There is always a principal speaker, who
talks on and on without the faintest idea
that he ought to let up, and the candidate
scowls with impatience, as do all the other
candidates. The candidate wants to get
to a meeting at North Beach and to
another on Howard street before 11 p. m.,
and he wants to turn loose a lot of steam
beer and a glad hand among citizens in a
few popular neighborhood resort?. He
wants to smile and make a good impres
sion with a brief little speech and skip,
and he wants to do it before the audience
thins out from thirst and weariness. The
"glorious Republic" orator sent by the
County Committee stays with his theme,
THE POLITICAL FORUM AT THE MINT.
and the fellow running for Congress will
follow, and he is entitled to considerable
time to discuss the glory of numble man
hood and the interests of the "common
people," which he will sacredly and de
votedly cherish.
As our candidate is running for only
Police Judge he will not be introduced
until three candidates for Supervisor and
the aspirants for the jobs of Auditor and
Street Superintendent have had their say
and applause, and he pays precious time
for the turn that is ccming. But there is
more than half the audience left when the
popular and clever young painter has
finished his song and the chairman says:
"I now have the pleasure, and I may
say, gentlemen, the honor to introduce â
to presentâ to you Mr. Bailey, who is a
candidate who is running for one of the
most important offices that involves the
rights of the peopleâ that of Police Judge
of this City and County."
Mr. Bailey is greatly honored at meeting
so intelligent an audience made up of the
bone and sinew of the commonwealth, and
it will be his purpose if elected to raise
the unfortunate, to remember that justice
is not cruel and to give no citizen cause to
regret that he was given that responsible
office.
Mr. Bailey makes a different speech
from the one he would make at Metropol
itan Hall. It is close to election day and
on that stage he is closer to the people.
Tho meeting is principally for candidates
and not for National issues and Mr. Bailey
makes an effort to adapt himself to cir
cumstances as he does a few minutes later
amid steam beer. Then he chipped in
$2 50 when the secretary of the club
rustled a friend among the candidates,
and he assumes he ii simply among hU
friends.
It is in and about some of these little
campaign meetings these nights that the
local campaign can be seen as it boils
amid its most picturesque surroundings.
Go to the right ones to see the candidate
make his play to the "push," and to see
the campaign elsewhere than on Market
street.
Mr. Bailey is not running on any issue
and knows that it behooves him to set
abroad and nurse the impression that he
is a good fellow. He is a prosperous
young attorney, lives in the Western Ad
dition, wears eyeglasses and a Prince
Albert coat, is proud that his eminent
father was a "Southern chiv," and he has
in the past contributed some thoughtful
papers on municipal reform to periodicals
whereby he has secured the hearty iu
dorsennntof the Civic P.eform Associa- .
tion, which is worth at least 120 Votes.
For two years he has served, without fee,
as attorney for two ladies' philanthropic
aesociations and he ha 3 several such leads
running into large circles where votes may
be bunched.
But Mr. Bailey knows that voters of
another class swarm in the neighborhood
ot the meeting he has briefly addressed,
and he knows that citizens who line steam
beer are going to vote for police judges as
well as members of the Civic Reform As
sociation.
And so Mr Bailey, who has dipped into
politics a little before, hustles from the
meeting witu smiles and nods when ha
has made his little speech and been ap
plauded, and in the hall he meets his
iriend and one of the boys of the district
who is in his right and who is to pilot him
about and introdnce him during the half
hour to follow. Go with the trio to the
corner and watch Mr. Bailey duwn the
"steam" with resolute appreciation. Tha
candidate won't buy any beer lor the
purity of election laws limits his expendi
tures, but his friend is much interested in
his tight and it is no felony for him to
"blow himself" to any extent.
It's a jolly good fellow is Mr. Bailey
then, and it's twenty schooners the bar
keeper hustles out to supply the thirsty
crowd that loves the joy of election time.
The young district politician takes Mr.
Bailey aside and, after a shadow as of pain
has flitted over Mr. Bailey's face, a hand
goes into a poctcet and comes out, and
then another hand goes into a pocket and
comes out, and pretty soon the young
man secures a chorus of three cheers for
"Mr. Bailey, the young men's candidate,"
whereat the moneyed friend gives the bar
keeper another job. Bailey takes in two
other saloons and then speeds on an
electric-car to another meeting he has
arranged to address and to more cam
paigning in the slums, and when he
reaches his bed he is sick and weary in
heart and head.
There are 252 lecal candidates out
hustling for votes, and every last one has
a lot of friends "in his fight." If you
watch the army at work you will see
many strange things that peoplo do and
many scenes of human life that slide into
view once in two years. J. A. JJehnt.

THE NIGHT WHEN FAIRIES HOLD HIGH CARNIVAL
When - Witcl'^^rxc^Dg^il
Are /ibroad^B
No night in the year is invested by pop
ular imagination with a more peculiar
character than that of October 31, or
Hallow Eve. Glendower asserts that any
one can then call up spirits "from the
vasty deep." It is said that all devils and
witches are abroad, while fairies hold high
carnival. Hallow Eve's innumerable su
perstitions are clearly relics of pagan
times, since they are all devoid of religious
Character.
Nuts have always borne" a most promi
nent part, as they still continue to ao, in
the festivities of Halloween. Among the
English, Scotch and Irish peasantry a
synonym for it is "Nut-crack night," a
name derived from the custom of cele
brating it by cracKing nuts with the teeth,
with hammers or by throwing them into
the fire. At llipon, in Yorkshire, another
synonym for Hallow Eve is "cake night,"
because on that occasion the mother of
every household bakes a cake for each
member of her family.
Goldsmith, in his "Vicar of Wakefield,"
describing the manners of some rustics,
tells us that, among other customs pre
served by them, they "religiously crack
nuts on Hallow Eve."
Hutchison, in his history of Northum
berland, compares Hallow Eve to the Ro
man festival of Pomona, aud says that
divinations and consulting of omens are
common to both occasions. "Hence," he
proceeds, "in the rural sacrifice of nuts
propitious omens are sought touching
matrimony. Two nuts are placed in the
tire by a young man or maiden and named
for two of his or her sweethearts. If they
lie still and burn together it prognosti
cates a happy marriage or a hopeful love.
If, on the contrary, the nuts bounce and
fly asunder the sign is unpropitious."
The English poet. Gay, in his poem of
"The Spell," thus alludes to this custom:
Two haiel nuts I threw Into the flame,
And to each nut I gave a sweetheart's name.
This with the loudest bounce me sore amazed,
Thai in a flame of brightest color blazed;
As blazed thy nnt, so may thy passion grow,
For 'twas thy nut that did so brightly glow!
In a quaint old volume of poems by
Charles Graydon, published in Dublin, lSol,
there is one called "On Nuts Burning All
Hallows' Eve," which also alludes to this
custom, as fol.ows :
These glowing nuts are emblems true
Of what Id human life we view.
Tne ill-matched couple fret and fume,
And thus in strife themselves consume;
Or from *ach other wildly start,
And with a noise forever part.
But see the happj-, nappy pair,
Of genuine love and tiuih sincere;
With uatural fondness while they burn,
Still to each other kiudly turn ;
And as the vital sparks decay,
Together gently siuk away ;
Tiii life's fierce ordeal bting past
Their mingled ashes rest at. last.
In Ireland young women place three
nuts on the grate-bars. One that cracks
or jumps is a faithless lover, while one
that burns or blazes is a true one. They
burn the shells of nuts eaten on Hallow
Eve aud cause snails to crawl through the
THE UNTIMELY TAKING OFF OF BLACK ROCK TOM
"I never had but one experience at close
range with a real out and out bad Indian,
and nothing much came of that; but it
wasn't his fault that I kept my scalp,"
said Frank C , as he tipped his chair
back in the shade of the old adobe wall
and rocked it sideways into a comfortable
angle for story-telling.
"It was way back in the sixties. Wait:
I'll tell you about it." He paused to fill
his briarwood and we composed ourselves
to the hearing of an interesting story.
We had met together this hot July after
noon, after many years of wandering
through the West, and in the reunion
each of the little group had some instance
to recall of old Nevada days, particularly
of our Indian experiences.
Tho Padre had just finished recounting
the mysterious disappearance of Sacra
mento Sam, a sub-chief of the Piutes,
whose record as an extra bad Indian stood
unchallenged. Sam had a choice band of
well-drilled ied devils that held the coun
try out around Indian Creek Canyon, and
who acted under his direct supervision in
any of the outrages perpetrated on the
whiies. They kept aloof from settlements,
except on the occasion of raids, and never
made any pretense of a friendly attitude
toward the whites. Sacramento Sain,
while in reality their chief, commonly
made his home among the whites in the
capacity of spy.
It was the Padre who related the cir
cumstances connected with Sam's last ap
pearance in public on any stage. Sam
bad, for a brief period, been unusually
friendly to the whites, which meant, of
course, that he was preparing some dia
bolical piece of work. People were sus
picious, and in consequence on guard.
One day he appeared at a camp in the
valley; the object of his visit being, os
tensibly, to beg some tobacco. Half a
dozen of the boys were there â miners and
a teamster or twoâ and they noticed that
he carried a small pack, which consider
ing its size seemed suspiciously heavy.
Two of them engaged his attention, while
two others constituted themselves an in
vestigating committee, the result being
that they found it to contain thirty or
forty pounds of powder, caps and-bulletsâ
taken no doubt from some murdered
teamster's outlit.

EXCITING SPORT IN TRAILING BIG ELK IN THE GALLATIN BASIN
"In the wild region west of tho Yellow
stone National Park where I have been,"
said Haswell W. Baldwin of Zanesville,
Ohio, to a Call representative a day or
two apo, "there are bands of magnificent
elk, bear, blacktailed deer and an oc
casional ibex. It is one of the finest hunt
ing sections on the continent. For elk it
cannot be beat."
Mr. Baldwin had just arrived from the
mountain wilds.
"It is what is known as the Gallatin
Basin and to get there you must co up tee
rugged canyon of the Gallatin, a distance
of fifiy mile 3. I was accompanied by H.
D. Atwood of PiUsburg, who is here with
me now. We went on some stout, ture-
Jo&ted Montana broncos accompanied by
ashes and so trace the initials of the future
husband. Apples bear a prominent part
in the diversions and superstitions of Hal
loween. Every one knows what capi
tal sport it is to let a number of them float
in a washtub and have blindfolded young
sters try to spit them on a fork held in the
mouth, while their hands are tied behind
their back. - Another familiar custom is
to swing an apple paring three times
around the head and throw it on the
ground, where it is believed to form the
first letter of the future husband or wife's
name. In the north of England while
performing this diversion it is customary
to repeat the following lines:
I pare this pippin round and round again,
My sweetheart's name to flourish on the plain;
I rring the unbroken paring o'er my bead.
My sweetheart's letter on the plain is read.
A method of determining the constancy
of lovers, practiced many times by every
American and English girl of our day and
by her mother and grandmother before
her, is to place two apple seeds, each
named for a lover, on the cheeks or eye
lids. The one which drops off first is
faithless, while the other, like that Dang-
Jas famous in song, "is tender and true."
Another very old Halloween spell is to
eat an apple before a mirror at mi might
all alone in a remote apartment, lighting
one's self by a solitary candle held in one
hand. Before the apple is finished the
face of the future husband or wife will be
seen peering over your shoulder. Gay
mentions another species of divination
practiced in time with the lady fly,
popularly called the ladybug, to determine
from what quarter of the compass the
future husband or wife is to come. He
explains it thus:
This ladyfly I take from off the grass.
Whose spotted back might scarlet red surpass.
Fly, lrdybtrd, north, south or east or west,
Fly w tierÂ© the man is found that I love beat.
Scotland's rustics regard Hallow Eve
with special awe and veneration, invest
ing it with intense mysticism and plac
ing simple, unquestioning faith in all its
charms and spells. The rest of the world
derive many of their Halloween customs
from the Scotch. In an old book, pub
lished in 1726, and called "Ye True For
tune Teller," there is a chapter headed,
"To know whether a mayde will have ye
man she wisb.es," in which I find the fol
lowing charm: "Wear two lemon peels all
day, one in each pocket. On Hallow Eve
night rub ye forepost of ye bedstead with
them. If ye man appear in her sleep and
present ber with a couple of lemons she is
to have him. If he does not there is no
hope for her."
Gay thus describes a divination among
the English peasantry:
At eve last midsummer no sleep I sought.
But to the tie:d a bag of hemp seed brought;
1 scattered round the seed on every side,
And three limes in a trembling accent cried.
This hemp seed with my viru'ln-han 1 1 sow.
Who shall my true love be the crop shall mow.
The belief being that the future husband
or wife will then be seen in the act of puft
ing hemp.
A popular Hallow Eve spell among the
weaver lass?s of Lancashire, England, is
performed with five small slips of paper,

toeing his way down the trail leading
toward Table Mountain until, when feel
ing sure of being out of sight of the camp,

moccasined feet struck out into the In
dian's tireless dog-trot, away from Table
Mountain and toward the hostiles in In

But Sacramento Bam had reckoned with
out his ho-t and the aid wbicu science
brought to bear upon white men's strength
of vision when she invented the field glass.
Two of the men watching, glass in hand,
'from a rise on the plain saw the old spy
chiei heading straight tor the hostile
camp. After a brief conference with their
comrades they decided that Sam had got
"mixed on the points of the compass and
neede<t a guide if he expected to reach
Table Mountain that night."
Those were not the days when men
talked much when deciding upon action.
A few terse words before they looked to
their rifles, a tightening of girths before
they swung into their saddles, and a sar
donic Bmile as one of them called back,
"Well, fo long, boys; we'll put Sacra
mento Sam on the right trail ; good-night;
see you again before mornin'." And they
did. They came back before dawn, with
tired horses, and each carried fifteen or
twenty pounds of ammunitionâ powder,
caps and bullets â which they said they
found ( ?) on the trail. They also said that
they had not seen Sacramento Sam. And
their comrades asked no questions. Cer
tain it was that nooce else ever saw him
again. It was one of the mysterious disap
pearance* of those troublous times. He
never reached Indian Creek Canyon â nei
ther did he bo to Table Mountain. He
vanished bodily from the sight of men â
and the world knew him no more.
But the Padre, as he finished his story,
hinted that â a dead Indian being a good
Indian â tnere were two men who might
have aided in the apotheosis of Sacra
mento Sam.
We sat silent a moment reflecting unon

The signal fires no longer burn by night
upon the mountains, nor by day do the
tall spirals of smoke send a message
across the valley to threads of smoke that
answer back. No longer do we lie down
in fear and trembling of the soft tread of
moccasined feet creeping in the silence of
two guides and having four pack hors.es
bearing our equipage and rigged for
bringing out any meat or skins we might
get. The guides were skilled mountaineers,
ready shots and could pitch a camp and
pet up something steaming hot to eat as
quick as anybody.
"The canyon, which is very wild and

almost an impossibility. We had to liter

In "Mother Bunch's Closet Newly Broke

the following: "If a mayde would know

In England's northern counties the
"dumb cake" is made between 11 o'clock
and midnight on Hallow Eve. Any number
of young women participate. Each places a
handful of flour on a sheet of white paper
and sprinkles it over with a pinch of salt-
Then one makes it into dough with spring

Ir\ the Mexican Qapital.
No festivals throughout the year are
hailed by the Mexicans with greater de
light than those of Ail Hallow Eveâ the
night preceding All Hallowmas, or All
Saints' day and All Souls' day. The for
mer was introduced by thechuich because
of the impossibility of keeping a separate
day for every saint, while the object of the
latter is to alleviate by prayers and alms
giving the sufferings of the souls in purga
tory. The religious aspects of these festi
vals is somewhat overtopped in Mexico,
however, by social observances, and even
the most devout Christians after attending
mass early in the morning of each day, de
vote themselves completely for the re
mainder of the twenty-four hours to having
a good time.
The night of October 31, All Hallow
Eve, is observed here with a universality
which is not to be met with in our own
country, and in a very different fashion.
At 7 o'clock on that night fancy your
self mingled with a crowd of people who
are pouring along the Calle de San Fran
cisco into the Plaza Mayor, within whose
elegant zocolo a Government military
band is sending forth strains of delicious
music. Both the Plaza Mayor and the
Pinza de la Conatitucion present a most
brilliant sight. They had been converted

we did. The*-e were lots of elk, and they
were as fine as any sportsman could wish
to see.
"1 saw band aficr band, but after we had
killed what wo wanted we shot no more*,
fur it would be useless, almost criminal,
to kill what we could not use. In short,
we only shot one apiece, and of these one
got away. We trailed this elk for a mile
or a mile and a half by his blood. If there
had been snow we would have got him,
but as it whs the elk's trail led over dry
ground, in some plases covered with
leaves, and we at length lost him. I sup

are displayed by the light of thousands
of tallow candles, around which shades of
white paper have been placed to increase
their power, every conceivable variety of
holiday wares. Nuts, raisins, oranges,

visible in endless profusion. There
are occasions when appetite, â  which

with a hearty reJisb, morsels intended for
the more homely mouths of peons.
Troops of young brats, trusting to their
legs and lungs to procure them customers,
go winding through the crowd offering
circles of flour paste fried in oil, which
are laid upon a long lath, held in the mid
dle to prevent it from breaking. It is
surprising to see how rapidly the laths are
eased of their burdens and the brittle fry
consumed. The kitchen is not far off, and
two cooks, in their shirtsleeves, are busily
engaged in producing fresh supplies. One
of these keeps a large iron pan over a
stand of charcoal, where it fries and hisses
most invitingly, while the other, seated
before a vessel filled with water and a pan
containing the flour paste, forms the cake
in a moment and draws it out into a hol
low ring. Thence he flings it into the
bubbling oil, where it browns and swells
into a crisp mouthful.

of wares, what strikes a foreigner as
strangest of all are the numerous quaint
articles designed to be purchased as souv
enirs of the occasion. Students of old
English customs have heard of socl cakes,
a sort of bun which good-natured people
used to prepare in large numbers to give
to children, who used to go about from
house to house on Hallow Eve singing a
song and demanding the "soul cake" as a
reward, but the booths in the Plaza Mayer
on Hallow Eve display soul cakes which,
for appropriateness and elaborate design,
far surpass the Halloween buns of old
England. ThÂ»y consist of three layers of
cake so placed as to form three steps,
covered with white icing, and leading up
to a chocolate cross at the extremity of
the topmost layer or step. Upon e&ch of
the other layers there is some design in
chocolate intended to remind the pur
chaser of the solemn occasion the
cake was meant to commemorate,
such as skulls, bones and cof
fins. Catafalques, made of wood
and painted black, from six inches to
two and a half feet in height and from
three inches to two feet square, are also a
highly popular article of merchandise.
Some of them consist of several platforms
rising one above tho other, elaborately
draped with black cloth and emblazoned
in gilt with crosses, skull 3, bones and cof
fins. There are skeletons of every imag
inable size and material upontiie counter
of every booth, some of them poor, cheap
affairs of paper, many of candy and oth
ers elaborately constructed of wood and
joined so that the pulling of a string
wonld cause them to dance and caper in a
weirdly comical way. Some of them are
fantastically dressed like ballet dancers
and are surrounded by groups of candy
skulls.
All classes seem to have turned out
to purchase these mementos of the time.
Men and women of wealth and culture,
accomDanied by beautifully dressed,
merry children, their hands filled with
soul cakes, skeletons, catafalques and
candy skulls, elbow and are elbowed by
the poor peons, who are spending the few
coppers they have laid by so carefully for
the occasion. It is a period of universal
merriment and rejoicing â a feast and joy
ous carnival without masks. The shouts
and vociferations of the light-hearted
crowd and their boundinga and gambols
in the shadow of the grand old cathedral,
which for over 200 years ha 3 stood at the
bead of the plaza, are such as might at
fust lead one to think that the inmates of
that philanthropic establishment, the
Casa de Locos (lunatic asylum) had forced
the bolts and bars and exchanged their
strait waistcoats for others of a more
elastic and becoming model, while above
all there arises from the zocolo strains of
such music as we seldom or never hear in
the States, for the playing of a Mexican
Government military hand is a revelation
of the possibilities of such an organiza
tion.
The dawn of November 1, All Saints'
day, finds the half a hundred magnificent
temples of worship which the Catholic
church has reared in the Mexican capital
emigrant teams that went by on their way
into California. They had cut quite a crop
of hay over at Mud Meadows (the wild
grass used to grow there higher than a
man's head), and had stacked it ready to
haul to Rabbit-hole. But the Indians
were getting pretty bad, and the boys
(there were only two of them) were afraid
to go over alter it alone. So they came
down here ana got some of us fellows to go
with them â armed, of course. There were
seven of us in all ; and we made the trip
from Rabbit-hole Pass across the big
desert to Mud Meadows all right, and
didn't see a sign of an Indian.
â¢'And thouch some one stood guard
that night while the rest slept we heard
no Indians about to disturb us. Early the
next morning we got our load on and tried
to haul out of the meadows; but it was
boggy in there, and we got mired, and the
oxen balked, and we had a deuce of a time
generally, so that it was almost sundown
before we got out of the miry places and
on solid ground, ready for the next day's
start. You see, what we hoped to have
done was to ger out on the desert where it
was as fiat as a billiard-table, and there
was no brush abGUt for a Piute to skulk
along behind and get within shooting
range of us. After we had pulled out to
solid ground, as I say, we unyoked our
oxen and eot supper, and it was just get
ting toward dark when who should come
down to the camp but that old chief devil

But greater even than the festivities of
All Saints' day are those of All Souls' day.
For this latter festival the church is sail
to be indebted to a pilgrim, who, while re
turning from the HoJy Land in 993, was v
compelled by a storm to land on a rocky V
isle somewhere between Sicily and Thes*
salonica, where he found a hermit^who
told him that among the cliffs ot the
island was situated the opening into the
under world, through which flames as
cended, while the groans of the souls tor
tured by evil spirits were plainly audible.
Through this opening the hermit had also
frequently heard the complaints and im
precations of the demons &t the number of
souls that were torn from them by the
prayers and alms of the pious, and they
were especially enraged on that account
against the pious abbot and monks of
Clugny. After hearing the hermit's tale
the pilgrim proceeded to the monastery of
Clugny, where he acquainted Abbot Odilo
with what he had learned, whereupon the
abbot appointed the day immediately fol
lowing All Saints' day to be kept in his
monastery as an annual festival foi "all
souls." The observance was quickly
adopted by the whole Catholic world.
There is another account, which repre
sents the festival to have been established
at Sicily in the year 993.
In Mexico the festival of All Souls is a
national aecoration day, suggesting our
observance of the 30th of May, but while
we decorate only the graves of soldiers, tb.9
Mexicans place flowers, wreaths and all
kinds of elaborate floral designs upon tho
last resting-places of all their loved ones
who have passed before them through the
dark valley of the shadow of death. From
early morn until dusk on All Saints' day
the cemeteries of San Fernando and Do
lores are crowded with people visiting and
decorating the graves of their dead. The
night is given over to general jollification.

ugly, but it was no use. We kept him
there; at the point of our rifles making

spy-hostile had planned a raid, and hia
men were omy awaiting his return to
come down on us.
"Wa kept him a prisoner, and they

out for ourselves. Then we let him go.
As he got down off the wagon we told
him to 'Get! and lively, too!' You
ought to have seen him go! He was a
good sprinter, and we had a tine view of
him as he traveled over the level desert.
"We got back to Rabbit-hole Pass that
night; and that was the last I ever saw of
Black Rock Tom.
"A short time after that a detachment
of soldiers captured him and were taking
him to Fort Churchill to investigate his
case. When they got down to Hank
Sprague's station, some of them went in
to get a drink, and left old Black Rock
Tom standing in the doorway. There
were people who afterward said that it
was a put-up job between Hank and the
soldiers â for Hank knew that if Tom tried i
to get away the soldiers would shoot him^
sure â but however that might be I don't
know; anyway, Hank motioned to the
old fellow to run. And run lie did. The
soldiers called to him to 'halt' and Hank'
yelled 'Run ! run! 1 '

A most remarkable and astonishing discovery in reeard to the visual
powers of the human eye has been made by Professor F. L. O. Rcehrig of
Pasadena. The scientific world will be deeply interested in the premises,
for it is quite probable thai the learned gentleman has simply taken the
initial step in the whole continuous series of connected subsequent facts,
leading, perhaps, to many as yet wholly unexpected important scier.nhc
truths and variously valuable new discoveries. Professor Reeling formerly
occupied the chair of Sanskrit and modern Oriental languages in the Cor
nell Universiu, New York State, but was compelled on account of his
health to flee tne rigors of the Eastern winters and take up his abode in
the genial climate of California. He is a man of wide learning and great
culture. He holds the degree of doctor of philosophy from the University
of Leipzig, and is also a graduate in medicine. During the late war he
became prominent in the surgeon-general's department of the United
States army, acting as a specialist on the eye and ear. He is the author
of a large number of works on laneuages, and they are quotel as an au
thority in both Europe and America. At the age of 77 years Professor
Reeling still retains his lull intellectual powers. To a representative of
The Call, who visited him in his laboratory at Pasadena, Dr. Kcehrig
spoke, concerning his new discovery, as follows:
"Some time ago while attending to my morning toilet I happened, by
mere accident, to look in an almost perpendicular direction and at a dis
tance of, more or less, an inch or two down onto my beard, on my mus
tache as well, and especially the whiskers surrounding my chin. How
great was my astonishment at the strange and unexpected appearance of
what I then sawâ every hair greatly magnified, just as seen through some
microscope. Each hair stood out in a plain and distinct manner, often
variously bent, knotted, irregularly twisted and forming a tube which,
according to all appearance, was transparent, rather colorless, hollow and
empty, bounded as it were on both sides by a generally well-marked
bright white hne or border, sometimes also more or less striated inside,
and endine abruptly in an open, either circular or, more frt quently, pen
tagonal orifice; sometimes, but rarely, in a closed point The size of the
magnified hair tubes varies from that of an ordinary darning-needle to
tne volume of a small lead-pencil; it increases gradually in proportion as
I move tbpse tubes slowly upward from the chin: and it seems to reach
its maximum when seen nearly high enough to be somewhat on a level
with the eye, or right opposite to it.
"I likewise examined the very thin and short hair on my hand and
fingers, and the result was just the same. Then I took one of those hairs
of the whiskers, plucked it out, and, isolating it completely, held it between
the fingers in order to subject it to the same examination â which gave on
each trial invariably the same result.
"The experiment succeeded as well in broad daylight as when the room
was in the eveninsr artificially illuminated. Monocular or binocular vision
seemed to make no essential difference in that respect. Dark as well as
light hair, red and gray or white hair, served the purpose equally well.

other persons with the same clearness with which I saw it myself.
'â¢Finally I took a thick hairiock from some child's head and held it up
to my sight, when a very large mass of Strongly magnified intertwined
tubes, .like a network of strings or cords, was at once seen. It increased in
size consid rably in proportion as I moved it slowly upward; it reached
its maximum when it had come high enough to be in front of my eyes
and held there at a distance of, more or less, an inch or two. At last I
tried the experiment in a darkened closet, where through a longitudinal
slit 1 Jet in the stream of a very bright, dazzling and glaring sunlight.
Every one of the hairs of my whiskers appeared considerably more en
larged than ever before, and the inside of nearly all those magnified hair
tub-s seemed in their whole length, as it were, lined with numerous fine
longitudinal parallel strokes, somewhat similar to the shading of a pencil
drawing, or as we often see it also in certain flowers, leaves and plants.

Will women ever be man's equal in
physical strength?
A good many of the new woman's ad
mirers contend that she will. They be
lieve that with a freer life, witti better
opportunities for physical training and
general development, the time is not far
distant when woman's muscular strength
â will equal man's.
It realiy looks as though the advocates
of this theory had a good many points in
their favor. The modern girl, East as
weil as West, is two inches taller than
what was the average two generations
ago. Si;o is near'y a stone heavier than
her mother was at her age, and that she
is superior in physical strength to the die
away heroines of the popular novel of a
generation since is evidenced by her
achievements at tennis and basket-ball,
golf and cycling. She can run faster,
walk further and accomplish more in a
given time than could her sister of even
a decade ajro, and, chiefest and charm
inpest item of all, she is healthier.
But what are her chances of becoming
the physical equal of man? Scientists tell
us that women possess more endurance,
more real nervous stamina than men ; we
are told that of ail fine, magnificently de
veloped muscles thatcome under scientific
observation the finest, most magnificently
developed are the right biceps of a black
smith and the left forearm of a working
mother, whose arm receives its wonderful
development in carrying her child while
going about her daily tasks. We know
that a mother can carry a child in her
arms farther and longer than a man can
without becoming exhausted. I once
knew a delicate, semi-invalid woman
to hold her sick child in a difficult and
fatiguing position for four hours. The
child's father undertook to relieve her at

the end of that time, but ere two hours
had elapsed his unwonted arms were ex
hausted. The mother then took the child
again, and for nine consecutive hours
held the little one quietly and steadily. I
do not think it could be maintained that
the father's love was less than hers, but
there is certainly a wonderful quality of
endurance that steels a mother's muscles
ana tempers them to such feats as this.
The average girl of to-tlay is not only
tailer than the average girl of twenty
years ago, but she is very nearly as tall as
the averace young man of to-day, while
he, statistics go to show, is a pood deal be
low what was the average height of the
young men of the last generation. Scien
tists and moralists unite in telling us that
this generation of undersized young men
is due to the excessive smoking of cigar
ettes among boys, an explanation which
is probably correct in the main. The
young man of to-day is unquestionably
not so much tee physical superior of the
young woman as his father was physically
superior to the young woman of his gener
ation, but this is a different proposition
from the one that the woman say of the
next generation will be man's equal in
physical strength.
Yet this is a possibility which is se
riously claimed for the coming woman.
There is, on the whole, a marked im
provement in the health and physical de
velopment of the present generation of lit
tle girls. They are more sensibly dressed,
they have greater freedom of motion, they
are more capaDle, physically, every way.
I question if any middle-aged 'woman of
to-day can watch a group of girls, say
about ten years old, to-day, as they walk
or run about their play or work, and re
member the physical restraints of her
own childhood, without feeling that in

One or two of those tubes appeared in beautiful rainbow-like colors.
"I also tried these experiments with the additional aid of a reflector,
when I obtained the same magnified appearance of the hair-tubes; some
this regard, at least, we have improved
upon old methods. I remember well in
my childish days being required to walk
up and down a long hall, my hands folded
demurely, one within the other, before me
and a thin book held between my arm and
body, on either side. I think I must have
had peculiarly unruly elbows, for lam to
this day distinctly concious that not even
that early training was sufficient to bring
them within bounds. Plenty of girls of
my generation did, however, profit by this
sort of training in genteel carriage, and
the result of it and kindred methods has
been a ereat array of narrow-chested,
thin-armed, ill-developed women, who
confess, with no apparent shame at the
admission, that they are "not cood walk
ers." A ridiculous assertion for any able
bodied human being to make.
The athletic eirl is bonnie to behold and
we like to see her with her erect carriage,
free movements, clear eyes and fresh
color. She usually has a graceful capable
body, with something nearly approaching
a normal waist, and feet that have not
been pinched out of shape by shoes that
are like nothing on earth or in the sea.
But when ail is said and done, how does
si;e compare with her brother?
It is not fair to compare her with the
degenerate type of unathletic young man,
the enfeebled result of cigarette-smoking
boyhood, for tais type is not on the in
crease, and it is not even among the prob
abilities that the masculine half of the
race is going to degenerate while the femi
nine portion continues to improve. There
are a good many reasons why this is not
possible despite the inclination of a certain
class of thinkers seriously to consider it.
There has recently been held in the East
the tenth annual meeting of the American
Association to Promote Physical Culture,
whereat Dr. Kelloge of Battle Creek, Mich.,
read a paper giving some interesting
figures regarding the relative strength of
men and women. Dr. Kellogg made tests
with the dynamometer, an instrument for
measuring force exerted by men, animals
or machines, on 200 men and 200 women
between the ages of 18 and 30, all in good
physical condition.
The measurements taken were of the
force exerted by the muscles of the neck,
back, trunk, shoulders, arms, nands, legs
and feet, and the diffe-ence in power be

tween these picked representatives of the
sexes was very marked. The average
force exerted by the arm flexors among
the men, for instance, was 120 as com
pared with 48 among the women arm ex
tensors, men 127, women 53. A very sug
gestive lesson "is contained in the differ
ences existing in the power of the muscles
of inspiration, a difference due in some I
measure to the corset-wearing habit among
! women. While among the young men the
I force exerted by the inspiratory muscles
of chest and waist were respectively 170
and 190, among the young women it
reached only 79 and : 85. : The following
measurements of some of the muscles of
locomotion are also interesting: -

The average exertion of force of the
muscles of the entire body was, for. the
| men 5190, for the women 27-10, a very re
i markable difference.
According â¢to Dr. Kellojrg's investiga
tions the strength of the average woman
is about 57 per cent of ' that of the average
man of the same height.
The ; paper is .exceedingly interesting
and of immense value as affording a defi
nite basis for calculation as ; to the limit

the orifices less round or pentagonal, but rather somewhat uneven and
irregular, lacerated, with a break of coutinuity in their rim, such as the

It must be admitted that nature seems
to have established this difference, and
while the sensible woman will continue
to do all in her power to accomplish the

well to remember that, as compared with

Jhe QraVe of a poet.
It is a touching coincidence that the
little English churchyard in which Wil
liam Morris was laid to rest is the very
spot which, in his beautiful romance,
"News From Nowhere," he chose as the
scene of the ending of the dream-life de
picted in that wonderful series of pictures
of the upper Thames. Dream-life and
real life have met at the end. The poet
thus describes his own place of burial:
"Presently we came to a little avenue of
lime trees which led us straight to the
church porch. The church was a simple
little building witn one little aisle divided
from the nave by three round arches, a
chancel and a rather roomy transept for
so small a building, the windows mostly
of the graceful Oxfordshire fourteenth
century type. There was no modern
architectural decoration in it; it looked,
indeed, as if none had been attempted
since the Puritans whitewashed the
medieval saints and histories on the wall.
. . . Though it is a little thing, it is
beautiful in its way." Henceforth it will
have a new beauty â the beauty of associa
tion with its poet.

fragments of a glass tube when roughly smashed would eenerally ap
pear.
"Then I extended my observations to various small objects, such as
horse-hair, blades of grass, needles, minute insects, etc. Ti.e result was
invariably the same. The best view, however, presented longitudinal ob
jects, in linear form, such as needles, strings and the like â which seemed
to lengthen out, or stretch often quite considerably, besides increasing in
bulk and growing apparently thicker. At last I resorted to magnifying
glasses in order to find out whether and in what manner or degre â¢ the ap
pearance of the objects examined would differ from that observed by the
microscopical power of the naked natural eye. This has, then, served as
an independent and perfect test to confirm minutely and with the utmost
accuracy the entire result in all its particulars as had been obtained by the
preceding experiments and observations.
"My eyes and the eyes of all those whom I made to see just what 1
saw, and that exactly as I saw it, are perfectly normal in every respect.
Persons whose sight is not defective can, without any effort or
sense of strain, at once perceive those magnified appearances. Almost
every one will find at first some slight difficulty in so doing, but with a
little patience will readily become accustomed to the strange sight.
Those, however, whose visual powers are even in the least degree vitiated
by anything anomalous or abnormal, such as myopia, presbyobia, hyper
metropia, astigraatiomus, staphyloma posticuni, etc., in short, by any
thing that in the domain of opthalmology would come under the head of
morbid states or pathological conditions of the eye, cannot reasonably be
expected to possess or acquire the necessary aptitude for these microscopic
perceptions.
"We must also distinguish between this constant, continuous and per
manent microscopic power and those merely accidental and transitory
states of morbid exaltation of the sight that are known as oxyopia and
megalopsy, in certain diseased conditions of the eye. Moreover, imagina
tion, as it may piobably be urged, fancy or self-deception are altogether
out of the question in this case, since the phenomena under consideration
can be reproduced at will and may be at any time verified by any one ever
so little interested in the matter. Here only the fact in itself may be
stated, without our indulging for the present in any sort ol hypothesis
and explanation.
"If any statement cannot be explained away by the supposition of its
being owing to mere fancy ana imagination, to some kind of illusion or
hallucination â and if, on the contrary, it really stands firm and secure on
the solid foundation of true, substantial, incontrovertible facts, and has
for its further support the possibility of being experimentally demon
strated as an objective reality â then we must needs loot for an analytical
'rationale,' some sort of law underlying those unquestionable phenomena;
in all probability some law resting on physiological optics and, as it were,
on the very constitution and mathematics of the eye.
"Like many other things in nature the fact here presented could have
been very easily overlooked during the past, and thus have altogether
escaped general notice; it has perhaps never come heretofore under ob
servation. Still we should not indifferently let it altogether pass un
noticed; for all this maybe merely a first step in a whole continuous
series of connected subsequent facts and may thus gradually lead to per
haps many as vet wholly unexpected important scientific truths and
variously valuable new discoveries.
"When applied to objects not tangible, to things lying in a surface,
then something equally surprising will be observed, viz. : two refracted
rays; and the natural naked human eye will exhibit the double refraction
of light, very much the same as that of the Iceland spar. In a printed or
a written page all letters will appear double, one set in their original
blackness and the other considerably less dark; the latter appearing, as
the case may be, either behind or somewhat lower, now and then eveu as
encircling the former."
What tke Stars Say
of AVorVs Famed Bard
Shakespeare's horoscope, which ap
peared recently in the Modern Astrol
ogy, a monthly magazine devoted to
that exceedingly occult science, will per
haps interest some of our readers, says
the Westminster Gazette. We append
the "map" of the poet's nativity and a
brief abstract of the salient points covered
in the delineation.
Shakespeare was born when the celestial
sign of the zodiac, Virgo, was in the as
cendant, hence Mercury, who rules that
sign, was the poet's significator. At birth
Mercury was in Aries, the sign governing
the head and brain. Venus rules the third,
the house of intellect, and is placed in her
ownâ Taurusâ in elevation over all the
planets in the midheaven. The benetic
Jupiter, who presides over hope, compas
sion and benevolence, is placed in the
cardinal sign Cancer, the sign of his ex
altation, and he throws his influence over
Saturn in the eleventh house, which rules
friendships, hopes and desires. The sun
and moon ore in conjunction in Taurus,
the exaltation of the lunar orb; Mars, the
planet of strength and energy, is in the
midheaven and the third natural sign of
the zodiac. The pars fortuna is in the as
cendant, and Uranus ha 3 a ninth house
influence in the fourth. All these testi
monies indicate an illustrious personage.
At the time William Shakespeare began
his professional career the astrological
portents were most favorable aud hon
ors and success were most clearly presigni-
Sed, which were, in fact, showered upon
him. When he reached the pinnacle of
fame as an author and dramatist in 1593,
the year in which his "Venus and
Adonis" was puolished, an array of bene
fic astral testimonies was present.
Later on it is found that disasters fol
lowed evil aspects of the planets, such as
Cascades of Wildcat Ganvjorx.
One of the most charming bits of natu
ral beauty in close proximity to San
Francisco is Wildcat Canyon, which, is
located just over the crest of the range
which shuts in Berkeley from the east.

Jupiter, progressive, applying to a semi
square Mars, and square the ascendant;
his lather died under several adverse as
pects, chief of which was Sun, progressive,
in opposition to Uranus, radical, in the
fourth house, the bouse ruling or indicat
ing his father. At 38 good aspects brougnt
him success; at 40 he retired from tlu
stage and lost a brother under evil astral
influences; at 44 his mother died under
like directions, while in March, IGIO, he
gained a lawsuit through favorable plan
etary causes.
The horoscope is necessarily ex post
facto. We knew all that ever will be
Known about Shakespeare before any ona
ever cast his horoscope. But the editor
of Modern Astrology find 3 remarkable
confirmatory evidence in the stars that
Shakespeare wrote his own plays.
A remarkable intuition is clearly
marked, as also his wonderful observing
power. He was truly a student of man,
and, unlike Milton, he wrote from what
he knew and observed.
To the astrologer there can be no doubt
as to whowrote Shakespeare's pla ys, and
we have no hesitation, judging from the
natal chart, in saying that Shakespeare
could be quite independent of Bacon, the
latter being more imitative, as his works,
full of quotations as they are, prove. The
above horoscope is that of a genius, which,
Shakespeare undoubtedly was. Great fame
after death is shown by the conjunction
of Satan and Jupiter in the cardinal
sign Cancer. The permanency of his
writings are to be found in the elevation
of Venus, ruler of the third house, in the
fixed sign Taurus in the tenth house; the
excellence of his works is indicated by the
dignity of the planets, and no better testi
mony could be offered to verify the truth,
of astrology than in Shakespeare's case.

IN SOCIETY'S GAY WHIRL
How the Smart Set Enjoys Itself â
Debutantes Attend the Season's First Dance
Receptions in Honor of a Bride
Chaperons, buds, belles and beaux as
sembled at Lent's Hall last evening to
attend the opening dance of the Friday
Fortnightly Club.
This popular dancing class was organ

Pierce and Blanding, and its success was
instantaneous. Early hours and an en

affairs a delightful charm that was not
only appreciated by the members, but at
tracted also many of the older belles and
beaux.
The Friday Fortnightly has recently
been attracting almost as much attention
as the Cotillon, and the opening dance of
last evening was eagerly anticipated. All
the debutantes, with the exception of Miss
Carroll Crockett and Miss Hopkins, were
present. These young ladies have selected
to first "come out" at their own homes at
a tea, Miss Crockett making her social
debut on Saturday next, October 3L
At 8:15 nearly all the guests had ar
rived, and dancing was immediately in
aueurated. One hour later the dancers
ranged themselves for the cotillon, E.
M. Greenway leading alone. The young
ladies in the first set were Miss Joselyn,
Miss Genevieve Goad, Miss Alice Hager,
Miss Romie Wallace. Miss Laura Scott,
Miss Frances Moore, Miss Margaret Salis

The NeW and the Old Jer\ Leads.
Much has been said of late by writers and
expert whist-players on the lead of ten from
king, jack, ten, and queen, jack.ten. For some
reason, better known to others than ourselves,
many whist-players pick up every new thing
that comes along and advocate it without
first giving it a fair trial. I suppose it is the
desire to be "a little ahead of the other fel
lows." In the great majority of cases they are
"fads," and few of them come to stay. When
the whist committee appointed at the sixth con
gress to report on a league system of play get
to thequestion oWwhat is the best lead from the
above holdings, they have a hard nut to crack.
A few months ago we spent a couule of weeks
with N. B. Trist of New Orleans, father of the
American lead system, and he stated to us, in
answer to our question in regard to this ten
lead, that he saw no reason for departing from
the time-honored custom of leading 10 from
king, jack, ten . . . and queen from queeu,
jack.ten . . . Every whist-player In Amer
ica recognizes the wonderful playing ability
of John H. Briggs and George. L. Bunn (Min
neapolis and St. Paul). For some months they
have been testing the innovations advanced
by other expert players of leading fourthfbest
from king,jscÂ»,ten.. ,and ten from queen, jack,
ten. . ), and we give the result of their experi
ment. In writing to the St. Paul Globe. Mr.
Bunn says:
The ten lead from king, jack, ten, with or
without others, has been for many years the
recognized lead from that combination, and
always proclaimed the holding of the male
honors. The queen lead, before the Introduc
tion of American leads, signified the presence
of queen, jack, ten, with or without others.
Since the adoption of tne number-showing
high card leads, the queen has also been led
from the ace, king, queen, and more than one
other, and from king, queen and three or
more others. On account of the supposed con
fusion created by the queen being led from
the sequence, queen, jack, ten, and also from
the other combinations, many of the expert
players of the country, indeed, probably a
large majority of them, have abandoned the
lead of queen from the top of the sequence,
and lead instead the ten from that combina
tion. In order to prevent confusion with the
old ten lead from the king, jack, ten, they
have been obliged 10 abandon that lead acd
to lead fourth best from suit containing that
combination.
Perhaps the new leads do tend to simplify
matters. The lead of qaeen always signifies a
suit of five cards or more, with king or ace,
king. The lead of a ten means always queen,
jack, ten, with or without others. This is
without doubt some advantage, and were it
not for the abandonment of the old ten lead
from king, jack, ten, which the new ten lead
necessitates, we should be inclined to favor
the new lead. In our, opinion, tne question is
thia: Are the advantages gained from the

Hauser, Mrs. Curtis, Messrs. John Pettee, Jo-
lead of ten instead of queen, from queen, Jack,
ten, sufficient to compensate for the disadvan
tages of leading fourth best from suits headed
by king, jack, ten? The advantage of the
te:i lead instead of the queen is solely that
it prevents the leader's partner from be
ing in doubt whether tbe leader is from
Iting, queen, suit, or from quen, jack, ten.
There is absolutely no choice between tho two
leads so far at trick-making power is con
cerned, except in so far as the leader's hand
may be misinterpreted. How frequently does
the lead of queen cause any doubt with part
ner? We do not know the exact mathemati
cal probabilities, but in our experience it is
very rare, indeed, that the partner is not able
to tell from his own hand, or, from the cards
that are played to the lead of a queen, which
combination the leader holds; a jack, or ten,
or king in his own hand at once informs him ;
king winning the trick informs him; if tne
Queen wins, ana the third hand holds ace, the
second lead will proclaim the combination.
It Is very rare indeed in actual play that
there is any confusion arising from the two
meanings of the queen lead. The slight ad
vantage gained by doin? away with one of
these meanings is, we think, not sufficient to
compensate for what we consider tbe distinct
loss in trick-taking which comes from the
abandonment of the ten lead from king, jack,
ten; we have experimented with this lead
and with the fourth-t>est lead from tho com
bination, and. on the whole, have found that
the ten lead has a decided advantage over the
lead of fourth best, unless, perhaps, when the
â uit is of four cards on !y , and even then we con
sider the ton quite as safe a lead as the fourth
best. In tbe first place, the lead of one of the
high cards insures the command of the suit
on the third round, even under the most un
favorable circumstances, and this may mean
the bringing in of the suit and a gain of sev
eral tricks, whereas the lead of fourth best
may prevent the establishment of the suit
until the third rouud. â¢ * â¢
One other point made against the ten lead
is that it affords too much information to sec
ond hand, giving him the opportunity of cov
ering with queen, holding ace, queen and
others, or queeu and one other. It is doubt
ful if this Information is of much benefit; at
any rate, we think it more than offset by the
information that the drop to a ten lead gives
to the leader. For example, North leads the
tea of trumps from) king, jack, ten and two
more; South plays ace and returns a small
one; North may finesse safely, for he knowa
that the queen is not alone with East, as it
would have been played second hand if but
once guarded ; if Korth leads fourth best, the

WHIST
finesse on the return may lose to the lone
queen. This situation arises quite frequently,
and the ten lead would seem to oe of decided
advantage. We have not attempted to ad
vance all the arguments in favor of or against
the lead, but merely call attention to one or
two points that have arisen in our experience.
UNIQUE SUGGESTION FOR TWO OB THREE HAND
WHIST.
A. E. Winlow of Willow Grove, Ca'l., writing
to our whist editor, gives us a novelty in the
game of whist. The following letter is self
explanatory:
Whist Editorâ Dear Sib: Regarding two-hand
whist, my idea is: Daal four hands in regular
way. Suppose two players only, sitting North
and East. North takes his own hand and that
of South, and arranges both in his own hand ;
this gives him two complete hands of thirteen
cards each, which he plays separately and dis
tinctly, his own card in North's turn, and
Souths in regular order. East play 3 the same
way with his own hand and that of West,
This permits a regular game with North and
South in one hand against East and W r est in
another. Again, one player with two hands
may have two opponents, each with one hand
and thus three people may play a game of whist]
I modestly claim this to be an^improvement
over, first, no game, as when* two or three
players are together and can find no quorum;
second, single or double dummy ; third, rather
better than to be forced to a less noble game
than whist,
Of course, for the ordinary player or begin
ner, it is complicated â even . more, so than
regular whistâ and the finest points of two
hand would never be seen.

palms and cut flowers, and the brilliant,
dainty evening dresses of the ladles made a

Every whist-player should read Scribner's
for November. Henry Jones, known over the
whist world as "Cavendish," the great whist
authority, has a very interesting article on
"What America Has Done for Whist."
We are surprised to see the suits in the
illustrated hands in the New York Sun men
tioned in irregular order. Is it possible that
the whist editor is unaware of the fact that the
order for nearly forty years has Deea spades,
hearts, clubs and diamonds ?
Why does not the whist editor of The Field
of London catch up with the procession and
use tbe words North, South, East and West in
speaking of players, rather :han the uncertain
terms of A, B, V, Z, which give no definite in
formation as to partners or positions?
The Trist Duplicate Whist Club has removed
from The Wenban to The Berkshire, where it
occupies commodious and elegant apartments,
at a saving of $50 per month in rent. The
management feels that that amount wouM bo
more judiciously expended in prizes than in
payment to a landlord.
Our whist queen, Miss Wheelock. is about
to issue in pamphlet form her rules, "etc.,
which she intends lor the use of her pupils
alone. We feel sure that the demand for them,
when once issued, will be so great that she
will be compelled to give them to the whist
â  tudents generally.
Why do not whist writers use the word
"tricks" instead of "points," in speaking of
the score? There is no such thing as points
in duplicate whist.
Our Whist Editor ir\ Oregon.
Our whist editor had the pleasure of attend
ing the regular meeting of the Kate Wheelock
Club of Portland, Or., an exclusively ladies'
club of seventy members with several applica
tions for membership yet to be voted upon
and, by the way, the largest club in the city
Miss Shelby read a very able paper on "Man
nerisms at the Whist Table," containing so
much valuable material that we shall in a
futuro issue.quote from the same for the bene
fit of our readers. The Wheelock Club expects
soon to adopt a system of leads for iv own use."

Peculiarities of
Washington's
Next Governor
Potter C. Sullivan has been induced to j
dress himself up in store clothes, put on a ;
boiled shirt and collar, and even to have I
his picture taken. Potter C. Sullivan is
the Republican candidate for Governor j
of the State of Washington, and it is this j
circumstance, together with the pressure j
brought upon him by his friends, that has j
led Mr. Sullivan to give some attention to i
his personal appearance. The thing never 1
happened but once before, and that was
not Jonc ago, so that the present tracta
bility of Mr. Sullivan may be an evidence
of tbe satisfactor\ r workings of the nrst at
tempt. When Sullivan wa3 chosen as a j
delegate to the St. .Louis convention, and j
was about to start East in a suit of clothes |
that had not been so much as dusted for a >,
year, the frout binding of which was I
badly worn, and from the trousers of
which nuns some two inches of fringe,
his immediate friends held a caucus and
decided that something must be done. I.
Acting in a body, they conducted Sulli
van to a clothing-store and bought him
two suits â a dress suit and another â and
laid strict injunctions on him as to how
. and where to wear them.
At St. Louis, of course, the fact that Mr.
illivan was wearing a new suit attiacted
â¢ ttle attention, and when he got back to
Washington the suit was no longer new, !
so the incident passed. But now, travel- j
' ing about from town to town among people !
every one of wuom knows him or knew
him, it is very different. His appearance
has created a sensation in Washington pol
itics and his enemies are trying to use the
changed conditions to his hurt. But they
will not succeed. "Uharley" Sullivan has
a hold upon the affections of the people of
his State that any change of clothes that
he may make will not affect.
Potter Charles, known in Washington
from Okanogan to Bakers Bay as "Char
ley" Sullivan/ is an altogether unique
character in Northwestern politics. A few
years ago, by dint of reading law in the off
hours of bis labor as a printer, he blos
somed out as a practicing attorney in one
of the sagebrush towns of Eastern Wash- I
ington. It was quite natural that when
the young man began to think of what he
was to be when he grew up his thoughts
turned to law, for he was the son of an
eminent criminal lawyer of Washington
and his elder brother was already big in
the professionâ is now Superior Judge in
" Whitman County. His father's dramatic
death while addressing a jury in a sensa
tional murder case is a part of the history
"f the courts of Washington that Is. often
repeated.
Â£0, although Charley shook off the re
straints of home ana of school at 12 years
t { age, and went to seek his fortuno in the
wubbub of the marts as a printer's devil,
we shortly thereafter came to a realizing
tVse of things, took a long look ahead
and applied himself to the law.
After a good measure of success at Col
fax, he sought a wider fieid at Tacoma
â¢â¢on the Sound." There he associated 1
himself with one of tbe foremost lawyers i
(and Democrats) in Washingtonâ Johs P.
Jndson, as the junior member ol the firm
of Jndson, Sharpstein & Sullivan.
I'rom the day he landed in Tacoma
young Sullivan stepped to the front rank
of affairs, and has remained there, stead
ily widening his circle of influential and
si'anch personal friends.
Quiet in manner, almost reserved, yet
there are few men in tbe State who bave
so many vociferous champions; certainly
there is not a more indomitable worker in
and out of politics. He is a distinct and
interesting personality. He has been
chairman of the Republican committee of
Pierce County almost since his ar-ival in
Tacoma. He was made chairman of the
State Central Committee ana chosen as
delegate to tne St. Louis convention. He
won the nonmiation for the Governorship
hands down and he will lead McKinley's
vote by SCOO November 3.
Sullivan's popularity is a puzzle to peo
ple who bave met him but once. He has
never outgrown that carelessness as to
clothes and personal bearing with which
he began life in tbe sagebrush districts.
During his term as Assistant United
States Attorney to Patrick Henry Win
stonâanother picturesque personality in
\Vashington politicsâ he bought a straw
hat for two bits during a visit to Spoitane
and wore tbe thing right along through
all the seasons for two years.
One day when Senator Dolph was stop
ping at the Tacoma Hotel â so a current
story goes â Patrick Henry Winston
dropped into Sullivan's office and said,
"Charley, you ought to go and call on
Dolph."
"What for?" said Sullivan. "He would
not know me. 1 '
"Oh, don't worry about that; he'd recog
nize you at once."
"How do you know?"
"Dolph has a good memory," said
Winston; "he would know you by your
clothes."
Sullivan was never seen to carry an um
brella or to wear an overcoat. The seasons
change, but he does not. He has no pride
of bearing and hia diffidence in the pres
ence of ladies is said to be nothing less
than painful. Eut those who imagine he
has won his place in affairs by the mere
play of eccentricities are in great error.
He has, on the contrary, won it in spite
of them, by native force, brains, steadfast
ness and loyalty to his friends. He re
signed the office of Assistant United States
Attorney in order to giva all his tirno to
the duties of chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee, and is said to have
worked and walked after oUice hours in
yeoman work during that campaign until
he wore the fringes on his pants full two
inches deeper.
He was chairman of the County Com
mittee of Pierce County during tbe Mc-
Graw campaign for the Governorship.
McGraw was a Seattle man and was a
leader in the movement for building that
famous ship canal to Lake Washington,
which was always considered in Tacoma
as a movement having no other good uses
ihau to boom Seattle. So local enmities

flamed up, and even good Republicans in
Tacoma fought hÂ»rd against McGraw. As
chairman of the Republican County Com
mittee Sullivan occupied a trying position.
He applied himself to the work of electing
McGraw with s"uch ardor that meetings
were held protesting and a committee of
100 bnsiness men called upon him to have
him desist. He entertained them, lis
tened courteously, treated the matter
good-naturedly, and before they left hall
more than half won them to the support
of McGraw.
His opponent is a fusion candidate, but
Sullivan has him on the run.

Gardeners claim that it is quite possible
to so arrange flowers that all the purposes
of a clock will be answered. The Popular
Science Monthly says that in the time of
Pliny forty-six flowers were known to

Fifth avenue hasn't looked so lively and
so positively interesting for many moons
as it did yesterday when the First Brigade,
New York National Guard, marched down
the uneven thoroughfare to the beautiful
white marble arch in Washington square.
Thousands of handsomely gowned women
stood on the sidewalks and filled the win
dows of every residence along the line.
When the different crack regiments of the
First Brigade proudly swung by, there
were gay smiles to greet them and ap
plause to tell them their gold braid and
buttons, their dark heimets and waving
plumes were fully appreciated. The Mayor
reviewed the brigade from a red-draped
platform in front of the grand stand.
For hours after the review was over the
avenue was made gay with the glimpse of
passing stragglers from the different regi

The mounted cavalrymen and their
gorgeous trappings recalled to mind a
cute little story of which Colonel Isaac
Trumbo was the blushing hero. He had
been attending some public demonstra

home decided to call on some friends at
the Palace Hotel. He followed his card
up and was met at the door by a fluffy
headed little girl of about four summers.
"Where is your papa?" beamingly asked
the colonel.
Without a word, the youngster ran back

Two well-known Californians have made
a tremendous bet on tbe coming election ;
the money has been put up, so there is no

it will be quite proper to tell who wins.

WILLIAM HcKINLET, of Ohio
1"OB VICF-VRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, 1&96.
The crisis is over.
We can count California for McKinley.
San Francisco will vote for her indus
tries.
Victory Is ready to light on her old
perch.
Tom Reed will have no reason to think
it is a jay town.
Prosperity is coming as certainly as the
3d of November.
The cry of coercion is simply tbe howl
of the vanquish d.
Confidence is already here and trade is
getting a move on.
One more week oi politics and then
comes business with a rush.
A few days more of lively politics and
then we will taJk of something else.
Don't forget to make ready during the
coming week for the grand parade on Sat
urday.
The intelligent workingman doesn't
need to see a 50-cent dollar to know how
to discount it.
San Francisco has been blue a long time,
but before next Sunday there wiil be a
rosy glow on it.
Popocracy speaks with the voice of
Bryan, but if it ever gets power it will
show the hand of Altgeld.
Make up your mind 10-day that you will
do what you can during the coming week
to help elect Colonel Taylor.
We can count on Kentucky to have
maniiood enough to vote down the hood
lums who tried to hoot down Carlisle.
There is one szood thing that will result
from the Bryan campaign; tbe Solid
South will divide ana depart from politics.
The rout of the Popocrats is a pretty
good thing. It will be worth your while
to get into line this week and help push it
along.
Some people may think Californians
haven't sense enough to vote for their own
welfare, but none of them are willing ;o
bet on it.
There is still time for Senator Hill to
follow the example of Morrison of Illinois
and nee to the mountains before the tidal
wave comes.
After the election it will be the hardest
thing in the world to find a man who will
admit he ever thought California was a
doubtfu State.
You are expected to take part in the
great procession of the friends of good
government. Every wide-awake citizen
must follow the muÂ«ic.
Every industry iv California has suf
fered Dy free trade; every man who is
engaged in the industries of California
will vote for protection.
People from all over tbe State had better
get ready to come to San Francisco on
Saturday. It is going to be the biggest
day in politics Caiif rnia ever saw.
Bryan will be the worst beaten man
that ever ran for the Presidency. Even
old General Pa'mer would have done
better if he had been given the same start.
We must have Republican Congressmen
to vote for a Republican tariff; we Â«nust
have Republican legislators to elect a Re
publics Senator. Don't forget those facts
in your campaign work of the week.
The overthrow of the agitators will
brine about a return to better times, and
the better times will put an end to the
discontent of tee people, so that any new
agitator who may start up will have no
one to listen to him.
Honest money Democrats in showing
they are patriois first and partisans after
ward have made a record for themselves
they may be justly proud of, and Re
publicans will not fail to give them due
credit for their assistance in crushing out
Bryanism.
The letter purporting to have been writ
ten by Major McKinley denouncing the
British and Irish soldiers of the Union is
too clumsy a forgery to be dangerous, but
it servi s as a warning of what we may ex
pect. Tbe Bryanites in their desperation
are ready to play any kind of a trick in
the closing days of the campaign.
Ex-President Harrison expressed the
sentiment of toe great majority of law
abiding Americans in saying. "There is
no issue presented by the Chicago conven
tion more important or vital thau the
question it raises of prostituting the power
and the duty of the National courts and
the National executive. * â¢ â¢ Tariff
and coinage will be of little moment if our
constitutional government ia overthrown."
THE GRAND PARADE.
The action taken at the citizens' meet
ing yesterday makes it certain that the
parade to be held on Saturday will be
something more than a partisan demon
stration. It will be a manifestation of the
fact that conservative Democrats as well
as loyal Republicans will vote on election
day for McKinley and Hobart as the
champions not only of protection and
prosperity, but of the maintenance of the
dignity of American law and the integrity
of American honor.
In such a demonstration every good
citizen should take part. As many as
possible should join the parade. Those
who cannot should decorate their business
houses along the line of march with ban
ners declaring their devotion to the great
cause and with the stars and stripes the
emblem of National unity and inde
pendence. No citizen of San Francisco
should shirk his duty on that day. Poli
tics in this contest means not only busi
ness but patriotism, and San Francisco
should show by every evidence that her
voice and her vote will b* on the side of
honesty, prosperity and good citizenship.
The march of the American people has
been always onward and upward. It will
take no backward step now. Great Dem
ocrats unite with great Republicans in
rallying the people to a contest with Bry
anism. Supporters ol genuine Democracy
find in the main issues of this campaign
tuat the vital principles of their party are
essentially the same as the fundamental
principles of Republicanism. Leaders
like ex-Minister Phelps, and many an
other stalwart Democrat, have not hesi
tated to declare that in this contest they
will not waste their votes on Palmer ana
Buckner, but will vote and work for the
Republican ticket.
In this unity of sentiment there is an
inspiration for every citizen. Since the
creafleaders of the Nation are united why
should not the people unite? The decora
tions along the lines of march next Satur
day ought to be so continuous from house
to house as to form sn unbroken display
of civic patriotism. It should appear as a
National holiday. It should be made well
nigh unanimous. It should have it in
cv. ry proof of a spontaneous outburst of
popular enthusiasm.
On this day of rest and leisure every cit
izen has an opportunity to think over the
importance of the issues at stake and
what he shall do during tbe coming week.
To this thou hi, therefore, should he di
rect his mind. Let him consider what he
can do most effectively to maintain the
greatness of the Republic, to evince the
patriotism of the people and to promote
its welfare. Let him plan the banners atid
decorations which shall display his con
viction and let him resolve to take an ac
tive part in welcoming Tom Reed to San
Francisco, and assuring the vote of Cali
fornia for M X uley und Hobart.
Remember as you sow in 1896 so shall
you reap in 1897 aud 1898 and 1899 and
1900. My ow earnest desire is that
you may all reap a crop of peace and
material progress. I believe on your
votes this year depend peace, thf good
order of society and the future pros
perity ot this land.â <-. urr^t A Hobart.
A NATIONAL LOSS.
The death of ex - Speaker Crisp of
Georgia is a lo^s to the whole American
peopie. The foremost statesman of the
South, he ranked among the most tmi
nent leaders of the Nation. Firm and in
tense in hid partisan hip, he was never
theless one of those wise leaders of parties
who know and practice the principle that
he serves his party best who serves his
country best.
His loyalty to the party to which he be
longed was most strikingly proven by his
refusal of an appointment to the United
States Senate, when to have accepted it
would have aeprived the Democratic
party of bis services in the House. Mr.
Crisp, like all other American statesmen,
had long cherished an ambition to enter
the Senate. His health had been weak
ened and his strength broken by his
arduous service to nis party, and an ac
cession to the quieter arena of the Senate
would have been to him not merely the
gratification of an ambition but a reiiof
irom labor that might have prolonged his
life. Nev rtheless, when on the death of
Senator Colquitt the appointment was
offered him by the Governor oi Georgia he
declined it, because the Democrats of the
House of Representatives requested him
to do so in order that he might continue
to guide ana direct them in the hard figiit
then being made for the passage of the
Wilson tariff Dill.
There are abundant evidences that since
the war he has been as loyal to the Nation
as to his party. A man of broad mind,
wide reading and large expnrience he was
an influence in the House ot Representa
tives that counted much for the dignity
and effectiveness of that body. The only
Democrat in the House who was in any
way a match for Tom Keed,. his leadership
of the Democratic party raised the dehates
in Congress to a degree oi learning and
eloquence which made them instructive to
the people. We have had few men at
Washington more skilled in parliamentary
law, and he never needed to resort to
wrangling and merely obstructive tactics
in order to maintain any cause which was
entrusted to him.
His loss will be greatly felt by the Dem
ocrats when Congress meets again. It
will then be seen how large a place he
filled in Congressional life and how valu
able his services were to his party and to
the Republic. In the sadness occasioned
by the announcement of his death the
people of the United States will overlook
his faults and remember only his genius,
his statesmanship and ins patriotism.
Georgia will have the sympathy of her
sister States in this loss of her greatest
leader, and the mourning of a Nation will
show itself in the solemn symbols of
remembrance sent to his funeral from all
parts of the Union.
The buttress or liberty is order. The
bell-tower of order is the law. Both
liberty and order are assailed by the
platform of the Chicago convention. To
that extent and In that regard It was
distinctly a concession to the exactions
of Governor Altgeld and Senator Till
man.â Henry Watteraon.
THE REPUDIATION OF CATOR.
The San Francisco Examiner, which In
the present campaign is nothing if it is
not the representative of the Popocratic
wing of the Democratic party, has an
nounced editorially the repudiation of Ca
tor as a candidate for Senator by the Dem
ocratic end of Popocracy.
Commenting upon the statement of
Judge Campbell of San Bernardino County
that Air. Cator has been indulging in
rather anarchistic Tiews, the Examiner an
nounced that "if Cator seriously expressed
such sentiments as those attnbuved to him
he is manifestly unfit for the senators hip,
or any other position of trnst." The Bry
anites' organ goes on to announce that
"Mr. Cator is not the Democratic candi
date for the senatorship, and. it makes no
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
difference to the party whether be be a
revolutionist or not."
This express repudiation of Mr. Cator
comes a little early, it is true, but it is
none the less a Btrict fulfillment of proph
ecy. From the earliest announcement of
the fusion scheme for electing Populist
Assemblymen and Democratic Senators
throughout the State, which was the re
sult of an understanding between Mr. Ca
tor and Senator White, The Call has re
peatedly declared that the Populists were
being bunkoed and that their candidate
for United States Senator would be undone
by the Democrats. There has been abun
dant evidence, as the campaign has pro
ceeded, that snch would be the case and
that wherever Republican candidates for
the Legislature were defeated by the aid of
Populist votes the winner would either be
a Democrat or a Populist who had been a
Democrat before and was only waiting for
election to office to go back into the fold.
The "foolish and incendiary remarks"
of Mr. Cator have evoked a rather prema
ture announcement of the Democratic
purpose. If the Populists of California
nave had any lingering doubts as to what
that purpose is they are now removed in a
most unmistakable way. Mr. Cator is not
the Democratic candidate for the senator*
ship. He will not, therefore, receive the
support of such Democrats as the Populist
vote may succeed in electing to either
branch of the Legislature. He is thus
robbed of bis last hope of election and
ou>;ht to aiivise his party that the bargain
between himself and Mr. White is off, and
that for whatever support they may give
to Democratic aspirants for the Legisla
ture they may expect nothing in return.
The situation of the Populist party of
California with reference to this matter is
in no sense unique. It is nothing more
nor less than a sample of the game of
bunko which is being played at the ex
pense of the Populists all over the coun
try. When the campaign is over and our
prophecy with reference to the un loing of
Mr. Cator has found its full and final vin
dication he will not be alone in the reali
zation of the outrage of which he is the
victim. With Mr. Watson and the other
leaders of his party who, at St. Louis,
were beguiled into deserting the middle
of the road, Mr. Caior wiil be united in
grief. When the period of mourning is
over they will find it not at ail easy to
extricate the Populist party from the
ditcn of disaster and def at into which it
has fallen through the over-anxiety of its
leaders for office at any cost.

CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATS
The capture of the Chicago convention
by the radical wing of the Democratic
party afforded conservative Dem- crats
an opportunity to muke maniiest to
the people tbe quality and the nature oi
their patriotism, and most nobly have
they met it. The American people can
regard with no little satisfaction the atti
tude* of many a man who has long been
considered a Bourbon partisan, but who
in this crisis has proven himself to be
worthy of hi* American citizenship and
capable of opnly renouncing his party
when it menaces the welfare of the Re
pubiic and its honor as a nation.
In every section of the Union Demo
crats of nigh and low degree have shown
in the clearest manner that they set pa
triotism above party. North and Souih,
East and West and each particular State
has furnished examples of true Demo
crats who in this camt aipn h:ive made it
sure that they stand for "country first,
country last and country with a stainless
honor all the time."
The names of great Democratic leaders
such as Clev land, Carlisle, Wilson, Whit
ney, Hill ana all that t r oo ily company
which met in convention at Indianapolis
and nominated Palmer and Buckner in
order that the flag of Democracy might
be carried by loyal hands through the
contest will long be remembered in the
annais of American history, and they
shall never be without honor among the
people.
It is not these leaders only, however, to
whom honor is due. Many a man not
widely known and whose name has per
haps never been published even in his
local paper has in this crisis come forth to
show to the world what trua American
citizenship is. Every county and every
village has its sterling Democrats who
have refused to follow Bryan. These men
not known to fame should receive from
their neighbors the honor which tho press
cannot pive them. It should be made
known to them by a thousand testimonials
of personal respect and esteem how much
the community values their citizenship
and how truly their services in the cause
of good government are recognized by all
who know them.
These conservative Democrats whether
they foliow the banner of Palmer and
Buckner or whether with a more resolute
determination to redeem their party from
ti e taint of Bryanism they have openly
announced themselves as supporters of
McKinley and Hobart are men of that
breed and character which constitutes the
vita! element of the American people. So
long as men set the welfare of the country
above the success of their party so long as
in all the walks of life from the nighest to
lowest there can be found stalwart parti
tans who put into practice th.6 principle,
"He serves bis party best who serves his
country best," so long will the American
Republic be safe from any danger of civil
disturbances resulting from party strife.
Tbe action of these Democrats, there
fore, may well be regarded as a matter
upon wQich the people of the country can
congratulate themselves. It is another
evidence to confirm the faith that a
government of the people by the people
and for the people shall not perish from
the face of the earth..
The Episcopal church has never en
couraged her clergy to be personal
partisans, yet I would be a dumb guar
dian of my people should I hraitate to
say that any member of the Episcopal
church who supports the Chicago plat
form trill do so in the teeth of the moral
teachings of hU church. I have never
been a party man and do not declare
for any personal preference in thin elec
tion, but 1 do declare for patriotism,
mutual charity and confidence between
the rich and poor, anti-sectionalism
and honest money.â Bishop Williams of
Michigan.
THE PEOPLE OF MARS.
Considerable prominence has been given
by the public press to matters pertaining
to tbe ruddy planet Mars. Tne informa
tion furnished by astronomers regarding
the melting snows, the formation of the
icecaps, the changing seasons and the I
atmosphere of the planet has been eagerly
sought for and widely published. The ex
planation of those mysterious markings
known as the "canals" has been striven
for with feverish interest. Eight out of
ten people wbo have given any thought to
the matter believe that Mars is inhabited.
Some have gone so far as to urge, in sober
spirit, the construction upon our earth of
a gigantic system of powerful lights with
which to signal our Martian neighbors.
We are agreed that Mars is habitable,
and, therefore, inhabited. But with what
kind of people? Are they prototypes of
tbe human?
The question cannot be intelligently
considered unless we divesc ourselves of
ideas and measures of judgment that are
applicable to the earth. We must place
ourselves in position to comprehend the
fact that the differest forms of creation are
exhibited in an infinite diversity. Upon
our earth there is not a species but what
has changed from age to age. Go into
;he library of the Academy o! Sciences
and see upon the walls tbe pictures of the
creatures of prehistoric ages. Beasts and
fishes, birds and reptiles, trees and plants,
all are totally different from what are now
upon the globe. What has caused the
change? New conditions. The horse, the
ox, the food fish, the oak tree, the apple
and the peach, the prairie chicken and
the sparrow could not have existed under
the conditions that characterized the
palsezoic age. The physicA condition of
the surroundings determine the character
of life.
We would be justly accused of rank ar
rogance were we to assert that the forces
of n -.ture acted only upon our little ball of
earth. They do act, but in a far greater,
grander scale throughout the immeasur
able universe; and inasmuch us our inves
tigations teach us that eanh conditions do
not extend beyond earth limits, it follows
that the forms of life outside of terrestrial
bounds are different from those obtaining
here.
The inhabitants of other spheres may,
for all we know, be creatures of fantastic
form, judged by our ideas of fitness. They
maybe wmged; they may be limbless,
eyeless, stotnachless; they may be plant
like; they may possess less than the five
senses which mark the human, and they
may possess a number of senses of which
we have no possible conception. The
character of the elements inherent in the
sphere shapes the particular form of life
that peoples it. A gobe where electricity
is exhibited in a different form than is
manifested upon our own would have in
habitants possessing an "electrical sense."
The denizens of the planets belonging to
the soiar system ol Gamma, in the con
stellation of Andromeda, possess a color
sense, of which we -know nothing. Their
worlds, lighted by three suns â one blue,
one green and one orange â enjoy a life' of
color indescribable iv splendor. The tem
perature of otiier spheres than our own
d.ffers irom our conception of balminess.
Some are intensely col.lf others are in
tensf h hot. Some are lighted by blood
red suns. Yet on all is Hie, carefully
adapted to each place of abode.
It would be ioliy lor us to say that, be
cause this star is hot or that one cold it is
uninhabited. We should simply pro
claim our worse than ignorance â our big
otry â by so doing, for we have only to
glance backward and view the forms of
life upon our earth during its past geologi
cal epochs to see that life has existed here
under conditions which would render the
present life impossible.
We would naidly recognize the Martian
if we saw one. We niay, in fact, be to
day entertuining distinguished vis. tors
from our planetary nei hbor unawares.

HON. EUGENE F. LOUD.
In returning Eugene F. Loud to the House of Rppresentatives the voters of the
Fifth Congressional District will act wisely in their own interests. Mr. Loud is a
native of Massachusetts and 49 years of age. He went to sea when thirteen years old,
and finally settled in California, In 1862 he enlisted in the California Cavalry Bat
talion, and served until the close of the war, most of the time with the Amy of. the
Potomac, after which he returned to California. He was a member of the Legislature
in 1884, and was elected to the Fifty-second, Fifty-third and Fifty-fourth Congresses,
ilr. Loud is not one of the talkers of Congress, and has spoken only when the in
terests of his City, State and country demanded it. He has don" the work intrusted
to him Blleutly, industriously, efficiently. To his personal efforts was largely due the
following"advantages to the City and State: The new- Posttffice building, resurvey of
the bay of San Francisco, removal of dangerous tocks from the pathway of incoming
and outgoing vessels, the establishment of a lightship at the entrance of tbe harbor of
San Francisco, a life-saving station at the North Heads, the postal-car system for this
City and improvement of Alviso and Redwood waterways. Mr. L ud was unani
mously renominated at the last Republican Congressional Convention of the Fifth
District to serve in the Fifty-fif.h Congress.
SUFFRAGE A RIGHT.
While the advocates of woman suffrage be
lieve that it would purity politics and prove a
benefit to the State yet' tney base their claim
primarily upon '. rhe inherent right of every
citizen in a republic to a voice in the govern
ment. Upon the ; recognition of that cairn
democracy itself must stand or full. The man
who insists that the suffrage shall be the priv
ilege of a single sex - may just as logically in
sist that it snail be the privilege of a single
class. We have . not yet made', the experiment
of a real democracy or of a universal | suffrage
and until this has been done there is no foun
dation for declaring . either a success -or a
iailare. ' "
The franchise is simply the mode of partici
pa ing in the common government and repre
sents the interests of each individual.' Tnere
is no way in unich he may represent himself
in public affairs except , by marking his opin
loi.s oat ballot and -having it cunted. We
have no such things as proxy or virtual rep
resentation in this Government. If we had it
could be delegated only by consent oi the per
sons represented, and women have 1 never I
given this consent. On the contrary they have
protested against rit in . constantly increasing
numbers since the Government was instituted,
and the largest petition ever presented to the
United States . Congress was that of we- men
asking to-be protected in the right to repte-
Sf nt themselves, as guaranteed by the ; consti
tution. . .... ... .-â¢ . --â¢'â ., - â  â¢ ' ;
â " ; "All men are created equal and endowed by
their Creator with certain inalienable rightt.
Among -ttese are life, liberty and the pursuis j
of . happinebs: ; To secure these governments
are instituted among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of- the governed." â â 
. Â Thus^eaas . the Declaration oi Independ- j
ence, and there will De no question, that the
Government controls the life, the property,
the ,â  destinies of â  its . people. â Itr is , lounUt-d
upon the eternal principle that every indi
vidual is entitled to tun greatest liberty that
shall not Interfere with the rights' of others.
When woman â  asks for . such a r share in : the
Government as shall enable her to represent
and protect her own interests she is asking
only for the liberty 'â  promised her by ; tne con
stitution, which will not interfere with any
otner human being, and this is her Inalien
able right. If you deny, to any woman the |
npht of ' self- protection . and | self-government
you have deprived her oi personal liberty and
violated the Declaration of Independence.
The Supreme Court of the United States has
decided that woman is a citizen,' so that is no
longer a disputable question.'; Now we must
decide what constitutes i a citizen. - Webster
says: "In the United States a person, native
or naturalized, who has the privilege of | exer
cising the > elective franchise." â¢ Worcester
says: "Aq inhabitant of a republic who en
joys the rights of a treeman and has a right to
vote for public officers.',' Bouvier's Law Dic
tionary says: "One who, under; the . constitu
tion and laws of tne United States, has a right
to vote for â  representatives : in Congress and
other public officers.", \ â¢ "â¢
â  How are we to reconcile the decision of the
Supreme Court with these definitions? Can
there . be any question : that suffrage is an at
tribute of citizenship under. the Federal con
stitution?''. Why does tne foreign-born man be
come natura ized except that he may have (he
right of -suffrage? He; can have every other
right or privilege which this country affords;
but, until he takes out his naturalization pa
per*, he cannot become a citizen, and ye t, this
new . title j elves him no more advantages ex
cept ' the right to vote, showing conclusively
that citizenship carries with it the right to
suffrage, . â â â .â¢.' ..â â  â â â ..â â '-Â»'' -- â¢","â¢ â Ââ 'â¢â 
That there can be no doubt as to the qualifi
cations of citizenship, the lourteenth amend-*
ment to the United States constitution says:
"All persons born or naturalized in the United
States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,
are citizens of the United States and of the
State .whereof they ; reside." And then this:
"No State shall make or enforce any law which
shall : abridge | the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States." But in â¢ order
that there may be no possible misunderstand
ing, the : fifteenth' admendment ., is - abided,
which says: "The right of â¢ citizens of the
United-States to vote shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or. by any Mate
on account of race, color or previous condition
of servitude." :: ..:".-/ â :;V'; :^ \-">~. '.;-.' " ;
Now this amendment does - not confer any
thing. It unequivocally admits, the exist.
right of citizens to vote and declares that they.
shi.ll be protected :in it. .It â¢ lorbids in '< the ;
most solemn 'language any interference with
this right, which is recognized as being of the
highest value. There :is nothing in either of .
these â¢ amendments, or -in the â¢ constitution,
which confers suffrage upon the negro; .They
(simply acknowledge the light which inheres in .
him as a citizen, aud guarantee that he shall
be protected in it. If suffrage is an inherent I
right in the negro, or in any citizen, it is in- i
herent in woman. â -;â¢. ' v â¢ - - ,
- In his dissertation upon the principles of
good government Thomas ; Paine 5 said: "The
right oi voting I for representatives is the pri
mary right â¢by which other ' rights are pro- ,
tected, r To take : away ; this , right is to reduce
man to a state of slavery, for s.avery consists '
in being subject to the will of another, and he
that has not a vote in the election of repre- i
sentatives â is so in this '. case. The proposal, ]
therefore; to disfranchise any class of men is
as criminal as to propose to take away their
property." -: Both 01 j these i were 7 done in the (
case of woman. Her property rights have been
partly restored to her, but she still pleads for
the right of franchise. .: : ;â  .; .
- Benjamin J Franklin ; said: ' "They who have i
no voice nor vote in the election of representa- i
tives do not enjoy liberty, but are: i.bsoluiely

; . James Madison said: "Under every view of
the subject it seems , indispensable . that the
mass oi the citizens should not be without a i
voice in making me laws which they are to 1
obey and In cnoosing the magistrates who are â 
to administer them." And gain: "Lei it be
remembered, finally, that it has ever been the
pride and the boast of America that the rights
lor which sne . contended were I the ; rights of
human nature." "â¢; What were those â :. rights?
The : rights â¢of i individual representation, the i
equal rights of all the people to a voice in the
Government.- : " . : : : â â¢ â¢ : /
Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania said: "I i
have made up my mind that the elective fran
chise is one of the inalienable;- rights meant to
be : secured %by the I Declaration of Independ
ence." "â¢ Charles Sumner 1 said : "There is not a '
doubt that women have the constitutional (
right to vote." Senator Morton said: "Women
have the same natural rights that men have,
and as the means under our form of govern
ment for the protection of the natural rights
of men is the right to vote, women should
have the same right and power accorded to
them. The whole theory of natural rights is
mere trash unless you saall give women the
power to protect them. The Declaration of In
dependence say 3 tliat governments are Insti
tuted for ttiat purpose, and ihat they must de
pend upon the consent of the governed; and
as women are one-half of the governed they
have a right to give one-half of the consent.
1 maintain that women have a God-given
right to take part in the administration of
that government which controls iheir earthly
destinies and interests."
Seventy-five years ago, in defining the privi
leges and immunities of a ciiizen, A-soCiate
Justice Washington said: "They inciuue all
such privileges as are fundamental in their
nature, and am. ng them is the right to exer
cise ihe elective franchise and hold office."
Nowhere i:i the past or pre?ent do we find the
suffrage referred to as a privilege. Beginning
with the Decimation of Independence and
running tnrough our history like a thread of
gold, we find the idea ot individual rights.
The fundamental principle of our Government
is the right 01 self-representation. But in those
early days the position of woman everywhere
was subordinaie. in the home, the church, in i
society. The demands of the household were
infinitely more exacting than now; women
were uneducated; the tyranny of custom and
tradition pressed hard "upon them ; they had
been taught, through all the ages, to 1< ok
unon man as the reprt?sentative of divine
authority, liven then, however, Abigail
Adam^, Mercy Otis and others of the advanced
w^men of the day made a demand for recogni
tion, but they were lew and wide- y scattered,
the times we're critical, and the government
was lelt entirely to men.
\\ ith every succeeding generation the need
of representation and the sense of injustice at
bt-ing deprived of It has grown stronger.
Women have become the equals of men in
education; they uave won their place in the
business wor.d; they are recognized as a fac
tor in public . lfe and tuey realize the impor
tance of a representation in the Government.
In asking this, they ask only wnat they be
lieve to be their rightfui inheritance. They
do not beg for me conferring of a favor, but
ior the restoration of their rights, of which
they were unjustly deprived when the word
"male" was i>ut into the constitution of the
State. They do not regard the suffrage as a
concession, but ihey wou.d quote the strong
words of Senator Gratz Brown, who said: "I
do not hold my freedom by any such tenure.
On the contrary, I believe that whenaver you
establish that doctrine, whenever y v crystal
lize that idea in the public mind ot this coun
try you ring the death &ned of American lib
erties."
The women of California ask only that the
men will perlorm the j.ist and righteous act of
striking ihe wo:d "male" from the suffrage
clause and restoring to them their inherent
and inalienablÂ« rights under the consti.ution
of the United States. Ida A. Harper,

MmitittttiinTimmi 'CALIFORNIA TALENT
Finds a Gratifying Recep
tion Among Eastern Literati
The story is told tnat when Sir Edwin Arn
old visited our country, and was being enter-
tamed by a prominent ladies' club in' San
.Francisco, he made inquiries concerning Ina
â¢Coolbrithâ to the literati of distant
lands as one of California's poets. The ladies
questioned by the distinguished guest were
unacquainted with the fact of Miss Coolbrith's
poetry, and, indeed, with her very existence.
Thereat Sir Edwin marveled greatly, knowing
â¢ her to have lived for many years in their
neighbor city across the bay. This story may
"have been retouched a trifle to make It worth
tiro telling, but even if literally true it need
not have surprised the questioner so much.
It is very difficult to be always aware of the
angel we may happen to entertain, and It is
Etill more diffcutt to appreciate that talent
which is so close to us that It seems a part of
the everyday commonplace of life. A certain
distance seems necessary in order to get the
proper focus for enthusiasm. The dwellers on
the same street with Miss Coolbrith, who knew
her and her strange ways and her innumer
able cats, probably found it hard to realize
that the divine gift of poesy was hers, and that
her name hod a significance for men of letters
in foreign lands.
Little reeled the old-time friends of Frank
Burgessâ in those days an abstracted youth
who would not talkâ that in him they beheld
the future author of "The Purple Cow" and
the originator of that "Lark," wnich away
from home has been taken so seriously. The
Btory goes that when the little paper was ad
vertised at 5 cents a monthly copy or $1 a
year, some thirty yearly subscriptions came
in, presumably for the sake of the reduced
rates! The joke had to be elaborately ex
plained, but history does not relate whether
or not the money was refunded. But Mr.
Burgess has done some good work aside from
his nonsense jingles, though, indeed, it takes
a sort of genius to do these well. It requires
no seer, now, to predict for him 'an assured
future. It is much in his favor that he is a
lover of Stevenson and will probablyâ like his
great master â rest satisfied short of that
perfection which comes from taking Infinite
pains. He had a fine quatrain in the Septem
ber Bookman:
Conduct me, Zens, and tnou O Destiny,
Wherever thy decrees have fixed my lot, <â¢
i follow cheerfully Â»nd did I not,
Wicked and wretched 1 must follow still.
The old prayer, prayed to his strange gods
so many centuries ago by Epictetus, yet for
ever applicable to the eternal problem of fate
and the human will.
It is difficult to appreciate, until the verdict
of the outside wor.d compels us, the talent of
those people who are always ordinary, to our
view, because they are part of the familiar
aspect of everyday life. On the other hand,
it is immensely surprising to discover, as we
sometimes do, that the author of work we
have rated highly Is an unknown dweller in
our midst. One such (surprise was in store
after reading a very striking sketch in the
Century Magazine called "Six Bulls to Die."
It was a strong study in psychology, with a â¢
background oi vivid Mexican local color. It so
Impressed one reader that it was taken. home
at night and read again to the group about
the evening lamp. What was our interest to
learn, a short time after, that the author is a
Californian, a native of] San Jose, a widowed
daughter of Judge Porter, with whom she
makes her home.
The Century has been more than once the
gate of entrance into those "Elysian fields of j
letters" for young California writers. Chester
Bailey Fernald first appears as a story writer
in the pages of that magazine. The way it
came about forms in itself a sort of story and
was related one evening by Mr. Fernald in
answer to various questions from an interested
circle of people in a friend's house. He will
pardon, I am certain, one listener for retelling
it here. It was during his two years' experi
ence in Washington as correspondent of one
of the San Francisco papers that he met the
celebrated and notorious Count ; ewitz
and his Chinese secretary. The Count | was a |
Russian impostor, whose large schemes for
raising money In this country fell through.
His secretary, a high-class Chinaman, was his
dupe. After the failure of , the Count's plans
the secretary was thrown upon his own re
sources and confided tp Mr. Fernald his desire
to enter the field of journalism. As his knowl
edge of English was extremely limited there
seemed to be a barrier to success in that line
that might have "daunted an abler man than
Mr. Ting. His "pigeon English" was beyond
all description fascinating and unique.
I The idea of collaborating with this Celestial
suggested it6elt to Mr. Fernald. Mr. Ting
could furnish the dialect which he himself
would faithfully transcribe (if any one may
use that word in reference to a typewriter),
and incidentally furnish the construction of
the story. Mr. Ting's joy was intense. He had
the true Oriental respect for books. His am
bition could conceive no greater satisfaction
than that of seeing his own words in print!
The great work was finally completed, and,
under the title. "Chung Tow, the High Rob,"
was sent to the Century.
Mr. Fernald, meantime, went to Alaska and
dismissed the whole matter from his mind.
It was recalled by a letter from. the Magazine,
saying they were considering the acceptance
of the story, though they had a short time be
fore resolved to "cut" dialect, and they asked
â whether Mr. Fernald could furnish them with
some Chinese illustrations.. With the exuber
ance of youth and a Western Union Telegraph
frank, he wired them that he could and would.
With a twinkle in his eye, Mr. Fernald assured
his bearers that the Century Company gave
him to understand that there was no hurry.
He secured the illustrations on his return to
San Francisco, paying $10 to an interpreter to
find him an artist and $5 to the man for doing
the work.
The story was then formally accepted and
Mr. Fernald was abuut to write his "collabora
tor" to that effect, when he read in the morn
ing paper of an expedition engaged in by Mr,
Ting for the purpose of gathering mushrooms,
of which he was extremely fond. The mush
rooms had proved to be toadstools, and at the
moment of his reading the news Mr. Ting was
dead. He never lived to know that he had be
come an author. Poor Mr. Ting, that cup of
joy was held to lips powerless to taste. But
Mr. Fernald has written much since then.
"The Cat and the Cherub" was an instant suc
cess and brought him wide recognition. Mr.
Richard Henry. Stoddard is. said to have de
clared it the "best short piece of fiction pro
duced in the United States within a decade."
His earlier stories were suffused with the very
atmosphere of Chinatown and opened up a
unique field to fiction. â¢ Since then he has
shown great versatility in 1A range of sub
jects, varied irom Irish sailor yTtrns or tales In
the "down East" vermicular to society studies.
ProDably few readers of Caspar Whitney's
delightful sporting articles in Harper's Maga
zine are aware of the fact that the writer is a
Caiifornian. He was an Oakland boy, and is
remembered by his fellows !' at ; Mr. ; Dagan's
school as being more devoted to football than
to Latin. However, he certainly succeeded in
mastering good English. Besides meeting the
present fad. bis articles on athletics and vari
ous outdoor sports or daring adventures are so
well; written that they reach the dignity of
literature..
Readers of the Atlantic Monthly will have
noticed that very powerful story in the Octo
ber number called "Abandoned on the Plains,"
and signed Batter'man Lindsay. Those, who
were impressed by the virile force of treat
mentâ all must : have been who read it
may be surprised to learn that the author is a
woman and a native of San Francisco. Annie
Batterman Lindsay is a daughter of General
C. 0. ' Herman, an old-time : Californian and
Virginia City man. /, ! . .- l' -" '
Mrs. Lindsay has written a number of
stories which were ' published in the
San Francisco Argonaut. Her I home is lln
Seattle. This story is her first appearance in
the Atlantic. It has already been noted and
highly praised in some ot the v Bos ton ; papers.
She received from the ; editor, together j with a
check for the tale, a personal letter of com
mendation and a request for more. The story
tells of the abandonment in the desert of two i
Indians. The man is old and crippled and tn'e i
woman blind,- Both are useless, -ao'<heyÂ«e 1
1 turned out by their tribe to aie. The sory
breathes the awful desolation of the alkali and
sagebrush. Terribly vivid is the picture of
the old man's feeble and futile struggle for life
and his final surrender to the grim destroyer,
and the woman's voluntary death in the
salt waters of the lake.
"Picaroon" enas a laudatory review of a
cenaln writer in the Chap Book with the words,
"Here is a man to keep your eye on." To
honor the phrase, one can say with a good deal
of certainty in regard to Batterman Lindsay,
"Here is a writer to keep your eye on."

HOW TO USE A DICTIONARY.
As an educator in the aid it affords the gen.
eral reader, as a help to the etymologist and
to the student of foreign , languages the dic
tionary is alike of immense -value. It is a
work that is called into requisition even ;by
the most careless of students. The thoughtful
press it into service oftener; but how many
are there who really - employ the dictionary
with an intelligent appreciation of its worth ?
Few, indeed, it must be confessed. Yet a little
attention to the matter will show that the
small amount of ; care devoted to its proper
employment will yield returns whose value is
totally out ot proportion to that of the labor
expended. 'â .â¢.' : â ";'â â >'.:
It is a fact often commented upon that there
exists a very prevalent notion that dictionaries
make dry reading. This ; may have been the
case with the older so-called standard diction
aries. Within the last year or two, however,
there has been preat competition among
American publishers, to produce a dictionary
that, while it should be able to claim author
ity for its definitions, should at the same time'
possess a certain interest,' not only for the stu
dent, but for the general reader. The effort to
issue such a work was a direct response to a
popular demand, and as a result we now have
dictionaries that are veritable encyclopedias
of information, covering the largest possible
field tersely and thoroughly. ."
Now, as to the when and where of the use of
a â  dictionary, we may lay down as axiomatic
the rule that it should be constantly at hand
when t one is engaged In the perusal of any
book, be it poetry, fiction, theological or scien
tific. Good writersâ and this is especially true
of past generations of authorsâ make
use of a word, a phrase, an expression, that
strikes the ear with a novel ring. To read
their works intelligently requires a certain
familiarity .with the rules that govern r the
grammatical construction of the i English lan
guage. A fair knowledge of the commoner
Anglo-Saxon affixes and prefixes is also essen
tial. ''^^^S^WW^f^^WW^SÃUn
; Any good modern dictionary will present

'an'; advantage i but a positive necessity. ' J Let

boxÃ^s. ' '^- . ...
.In the present little book Dr. Henry Berko
witz of Philadelphia has performed a service
to those desirous of obtaining a fuller knowl-
I edge of the Old Testament than is at present
to be gained in the Sunday-schooL He has
taken up each of its books, dissected them and
furnished for use with each a number of valu
able suggestions as to the best method of study.
To this there has been added a series of ques
tions with the object of testing the reader's
knowledge of his subject after studying the
same. The main idea has been carried out in
connection with the now well ana favorably
known Chautauq:ian system ol" education.
The scheme thus carried out by Dr. Cerkowitz
is a commendeiblf one, for the reason that, as
t:e notes in introducing the present volume,
i tne Bib. c is to many a sealed book, acknowl
edged as a classic, but kept unopened from one
year's end to the other. That there is to-day a
renaissance in the study of the Bible and in
higher Biblical criticism is evidenced by the
lartre number of works on the subject is
sued from both American and English publish
ing houses, lv this connection Professor
Richard G. Moulton's "Modern Reader's" Bi
ble will be remembered, and it is satisfactory
to note that tne able professors work is rec
ommended and indorsed by Dr. Berkowitz for
those who desire to follow Mr. Moulton's ap.
plication of his iiterary treatment to the vari

AN .AUSTRALIAN TALE.
THE MINEK'SCUPâ A Coolgardle Romance. By
]Sat Gould. New ork: George Koutledge & Mods,
.Limited. For sate at the Emporium Book De
parttu<m; price $L
This is a novel of life in an Australian min
ing camp, and is published uniform with the
same author's -'Sporting Series" of works. The
author of "The Miner's Cup," while making
no pretense to style, has written a readable
story telling of the adventures of Alec Welton
and Will Barker, two Australians. The scene
is laid in Sydney, and later in Perth and Cool
gardie.
Some of the scenes pictured by the author of
'â¢The Miner's Cup" are somewhat reminiscent
of Charles Reade, who was particularly suc
cessful in the delineation of border outlaw
characters. The book tinder review, however,
is not by any means to be compared with "It's
Never Too Late to Mend." It lacks finish, and
would probably find more favor in the eyes of
a grown boy than with adult readers of Ac
tion.

The approach of the Christmas holidays Is
the signal for publishers to commence work
on books suitable ior presentation to the

creditable effort in this direction. The read
ing matter, both prose and verse, is of such a
character as to be readily understandable to
the most diminutive intellect; and the colored
full-page pictures will also be the delight of
the season to the tots of America. The color
ing in these latter leaves nothing to be de
sired, and serves to show that in fine art work
American printers are at least the equals of
their German competitors.
STORY OF PALESTINE.
THE SWORDMAKEK'S SON. By W. O. Stod

Price $1 50.
This >s a dramatic story of boy life in the
Holy Land at the beginning of the Christian
era. The hero is the son of a Jewish sword
maker, who rebels agaiusl, the Roman domi
nation of Judea and is driven into hiding.
The plot brings the young hero into active
participation with the very founding of
Christianity, and the events of sacred history
are treated in the most reverent spirit. There
is also a picture of life in imperial Rome in the
days of Tiberius, with an account of afoot
race and the preliminary training of the
athletes. Mr. Stoddard visited Palestine for
the sake of getting the local color for his
story. Mr. Varian's pictures have been drawn
with careful attention to accuracy of detail
and the preservation of the spirit of the time

NEW AND CHEAP EDITION
RANCH LIFE AND THE HUNTING TRAIL.
by ThPOdoru Koosevelt, with illustrations by
Frederic Remington. New and popular edition.
New York: Tne century Company; price ?U 60.
Although Mr. Roosevelt is still a young man,
his life has been a particularly full one. Aside
from his official career, in which he has held
several very important positions, he has been
a ranchman on the frontier, a hunter of
mighty game, and a successful author in a
number of different lines. One of his most
popular books, the sumptuous "Ranch Lifo
and the Hunting Trail," has been out of print
for some time, and now a new and
cheaper edition is. brought out. Few persons
who have lived the actual life of the ranch
man have had the ability to describe its dra
matic and pic;uresque phases; most accunts
have been written by mere tourists and on
lookers. Mr. Roosevelt was working a rancb,
summer and winter, during- the days of excit
ing frontier tragedies. Ho was thrown into
daily contact with the border desperadoes and
the Indians. It is this unconventional life
that he describes, and he has also given
chapters on mountain and prairie hunting,
and the pursuit of the wapiti, the big-horn
sheep and the white gcat of the high peaks.
Many of Mr. Remington's most admired
pictures are in this volume.

George W. CaTsle was the first to moke appa
rent to the general public what a rich store of
romance was to De found among the Creoles
of Louisiana. Miss Mary Tracy Earle has gone
to this field for inspiration for the present
story. Tne title is taken from a luminous
wheel that awoke superstitious fears in the
minds of the ignorant Creoles,. who some
times, with bated breath, saw it revolve in the
dead of night. Just what this wheel was and
the purpose it served is best left to the reader
to discover. The development of the story is
concerned with the efforts of the owner of the
wheel to live down the 'hoodoo" that it brings
upon him, his little daughter and her fair
cousin. The story is full of local coloring,
and is Imaginative and humorotls in its char
acter.
GOOD-NA URED SATIRE.
THE METROPOLITANS. By Jean le Drake. New
York; Tne Century Company.. Price SI 25.
This is a good-natured satire on New York
society, besides being a novel of considera
ble diversity of plot. The title is justified by
the typicxl character of the hero, the heroine,
and most of the minor characters. A bril
liant and gifted young man, who has been
meanly deprived of his inheritance, wins his
way to success as a composer and gains his re
ward as a lover by dropping his idle associ
ates and accepting the gospel of hard work.
The scene Is laid main.y in New York City,
but the author has introduced a decided nov
elty in shifting the scene during an important
part of the development ot the plot to the
Arctic regions. Here the hero's character is
finally rounded out by the hardship and pri
vation that necessarily accompany life in an
Eskimo igloo. The dramatic element of this
portion of the story is intensified by the pres
ence amid these uncongenial surroundings of
a beautiful Hungarian singer, who h*s helped
the hero's operas into popular favor. Miss
Drake has avoided hackneyed incidents and
ventured into new fields.

A NEW NOVEL FULL OF
Human Interest by a Clever
Young San Francisco Girl
THE JOY OJF LtFK. By Emma Wolf. Chicago:
A. C. McClurg & Co., 117-I'il W abash avenue.
for sale at all bookstores; price $1.
The novel-reading public, and particularly
that portion of it resident in San Francisco,
will welcome this the latest stpry by Emma
Wolf.
Miss Wolf is a local authoress whose work
has aiready been referred to in commendatory
terms in these columns. Her first effort was
entitled "Other Thines Being Equal," and
gave promise of better writisg in the future.
She then produced "A House of Cards," which
was a distinct step in advance of her first
book. The last novel by this young authoress,
who has named it "The Joy of LUe," can be
classed, not only as tho best of Miss Woli's
productions, but as entitled to take rank
among the best novels written this year.
After the vast number of what have been
aptly termed erotic, neurotic and tommyrotic
stories, "The Joy of Life" comes as a refresh
ing reiief. American readers are simply tired
of novels with a purpose, and the sun of
these salacious specimens of literature has
already set. What is demanded to-day is a
return to that class of novels placed before the
public a generation agoâ novels of human in
terest, novels that tell a story. Miss Wolf has
recoKiiized this tendency. Perceiving the Jus
tice of the readers' demands 6he nas acceded
to them, and as a result the work under rev<ew
is not only her best, but is one upon which we
prophesy her reputation will stand.
"The Joy of Life" is remarkable primarily for
the really fine pen portraits of its principal
characters that are presented to the reader.
Take that of Antony Trent, for example.
Here we have a unique, strong, masterful per
sonality indeed. Antony is the son of a poor
proprietor of a country newspaper. At an
eariy age he is turned loose upon the world to
make his own way. His character can be
gauged from a short dialogue which takes
place between his younger brother and him
self while he is yet a mere stripl.ng:
"Tony, of what are you thinking?"
"Of the future."
"What are you going to be when you are a
man, Tony?"
"Rich."
"But I mean what are you going to do?"
"Make money."
"But what are you going to do to make
money?"
"Work."
"But lots of fellows work and don't get rich."
"I will."
"Why;"
"Because I will."
"And will you be happy when you are rich,
Tony?"
"Yes."
"Father says money Is a curse."
"Poohl"
"Isn't it? Isn't money a curse, Tony?"
"Yes; to those who have none."
Here we see the man in the embryo. Sordid
as his character may appear, one cannot but
watch with interest the growth of a youth who
puts forward these ideas.
But Antony possesses, in addition to his
money-getting ideas, something of a soul. His
younger brother, Cyril, must be assisted
through the world, and here is the difficulty.
In sharp contrast to his alert brother, Cyril is
a philosopher, a thinker, a "dreamer of
dreams." At school his enthusiasm for work
is only aroused when there is an essay to be
written, a poem declaimed, or a hero eulo
gized. The time arrives when he must choose
a profession. That is a well-written chapter in
"The Joy of Life," where the younger brother,
who has aiways leaned for support upon the
elder, is questioned by him regarding this
matter. Cyril confesses that ''he could not
| breathe in a store," which elicits the trite ob-
I servation from his brother that "beggars can-
J not be choosers." Through the night the
younger brother ponders upon Antony's
! words. Toward morning the latter awakes
and finds Cyril sitting uo, trembling and un
decided. Here is part of their conversation.
Antony i 9 speaking:
"Perhaps your instincts are right; we are
not all turned out after the same mold; you
can't make a draught horse out of a racehorse,
and vice versa. * * * My decision is taken
upen that point. I believe you might make
a success in a more scholarly fieldâ in some
thing professional. There would be whole
years in which you would not make a cent.
W'el!, a successful professional man reaps the
interest of his non-productive years after
ward, and "
"Meanwhile?" interposed Cyril hoarsely.
"Meanwhile," proceeded Antony calmly, "I
will help you. If you have anything sterling
worth cultivating it will show itself if you
care to work for it. I will help you some
what. * * * You may regard this as a loan
if you wish. Some day you may be able to pay
it back."
The words sounded chill, yet strong as iron.
Cyril shivered but clutched blindly at them.
"Thank you, Antony," he said, drawing in
an icy Dreath. "But it is too much; I may not
succeed, and beggars cannot be choosers."
â â¢As you will; tho offer stands; take it or
leave it; it is at your disposal. Well?"
â¢â¢Now?"
"Certainly. Don't gamble with time, Cyril.
When you see a fact take it. We can't afford
to lose anything. Well ?"
"Thank you, Tony," he replied, frightened
into desperation. "But I can never pay it
back."
"You may ; who knows ? Well, it is decided
now. You had better get into bed."
Both boys reach mature years. Further sac
rifices are made by the one for the sake of the
other. Their essential characteristics remain
the same. Antony by sheer force of will power
becomes the financial secretary of a large mill,
reacning that position after filling every mi
nor capacity in the establishment.
Miss Wolf has very cleverly pictured the
two men at this epoch of their lives:
"He (Antony) is a remarkably fine financier,
though somewhat conservative. In other
words, he is the direct opposite of his brother,
Cyril Trent."
"â¢â¢And what is Cyril Trent f
â¢<A fool."
"What do you mean by that 7"
"I mean he is no man."
"I don't think I quite understand."
"Well, (with a short sarcastic laugh) per
haps Mrs. Laurie's stinging rejoinder to that
assertion might be more comprehensive to
you. She said: 'Mr. Gerrish means that Cyril
does not break the seventh commandment nor
substitute Self or Gold for God.' It was an in
fatuated woman's opinion, but you may take
it for what it is worth."
The extracts quoted will serve to convey to
the mind of the reader an idea of the quality
of Miss Wolf's latest work. We shall watch
with interest the future products of her pen,
feeling assured that here in the West there
has appeared a writer who, in elegance of
diction and power of description, is capable of
imparting instruction to some authors that
might be named; who has recognized tbat a
novel should Bppeal to readers as having an
application to their daily lives, and who for
these reasons is entitled to take rank above
the writers of novels plus a -'purpose," but
minus a plot. Emaitoel Elzas.
LITERARY NOTES.
The issue for the current year of Poor's Man
ual of Railroads is announced. ,
Richard La Gallieune's new book, "The
Quest of the Golden Girl," will be published
some time this falL
The publication of Elizabeth Stuart Phelps'
"Chapters from a Life" has been postponed by
Houghton, Miffliu & Co. to an early date in
November.
The rumor comes from England that Mme.
Sarah Grand's new novel will be a sort of femi
nine "Tom Jones." This is a rather terrifying
announcement.
Edward Arnold announces for early pub
lication a new novel by Miss E. F. Brooke,
the author of "A Superfluous Woman." It
will be called "Life the Accuser."
The Critic remarks: We hear that the first
edition of Mr. Kipling's volume of verso. "Tne
Seven Seas," will reach 20,000 copies. Who
says that poetry is a drug in the market?
"The Land of the Five Tribes," i. c. Indian
Territory, is instructively described in brief
space by Allan Hendncks. Alvan F. Sanborn
casts some light on "English Traits," and R.
G. Robinson on "Florida Snakes."
"The Story of American Coals" is announced
for publication by the J. B. Lippincott Com
pany. Tho author, W. J. Nicolls, has in this
book covered the whole ground, from the first
discovery of coal in this country in 1679 to
the present day.
It is said of 'The Grey Man," Mr. Crockett's
new story, just published by the Harpers,
that it is founded on fact, that the terrt
ble story of Sawny Bean is a -well-known
legend, and that the novelist has practically
taken no liberties with the original.
The publication of "Sir George Tressadyf' In
the columns of a magazine has evidently not
tended to decrease its sales in book form. The
first edition, which was as large as the first
edition of "Marceila," was sola out at once
and another sent hurrying through the press.
The complete novel in the November issue
of Llppincott's is "An Interrupted Current,"
by Howard M. Yost, a new writer with a happy
knack of story-telling. The scene is in Eastern
Pennsylvania, and tho action turns on tracing
the perpetrators of a bank robbery and their
plu jder.
Brander Matthews has collected a number
of his essays, including "American Litera
ture," "Two Sides of the South," "The Penalty
of Humor," "The Scotsman of Letters" ana
"Aspects of Fiction," which will be published
by Messrs. Harper & Bros, in a book to be
called "Aspects of Fiction and Other Ventures
in Criticism."
Among D. Appleton & Co,'s additional
autumn announcements is a series of stories
from American history, in which each State is
treated by a resident author of distinction.
The first volume will be "New Jersey," by.
Frank R. Stockton, and the second "Georgia,"
by Joel Chandler Harris. Each volume will
be elaborately illustrated.
Herbert Spencer has completed his life-work
with the volume on "The Principles of Sociol
ogy." He is now seventy years old, and has
been engaged upon this work ior thirty-six
years, notwithstanding the fact that he haa
been an invalid for the greater pait of his life.
This last volume will be published by the
Messrs. Appleton early in November.
An aunt of S. R. Crockett, the Scotch writer,
residing in Springfield, Ohio, says that in his
boyhood he was willinz to make any sacrifice
for books, and saved every penny with that
object in view. As he grew older he would
spend days upon the hills studying the land
scapes he would portray with his pen, and
writing to gain greater grace and facility.
Charles Barnard has written a picture-story,
which, unlike the picture-play of Alexander
Black, does not show the hero and heroine,
but rather the scenes with which they were
iamtliar. Mr. Barnard calls his story "The
Strange Adventures of Miss Jennie Worrell,"
and in it he gives an excellent idea of life at
Chautauqua. It is designed for reading aloud,
in public.
The Messrs. Scribner will be the American
publishers of the new edition of tne works of
Thomas Carlyle, to be called the "Centenary"
edition, which will number thirty volumes.
H. D. Traill contributes a general introduction
to the first volume, and a short preface to
each succeeding work. A volume containing
some essays and minor writings of Mr. Car
lyle, never before published, will be added to
this edition.
McClure's Magazine for November will con
tain the first installment of a five or six part
story by Rudyard Kipling. It is Kipling's
first long story of American life, 'being a tale
of stirring adventure among the Gloucester
fishermen on the Grand Banks. It will be
illustrated with drawings from lite by I. W.
Taoer. Miss Tarbell will tell the story (a most
dramatic story, by the way) of Lincoln's nomi
nation 1 in 1860, drawing largely on the per
sonal recollections of the men who were most
instrumental in securing the nomination.
The paper will be fully illustrated.
In the November Overland Monthly Irving
M. Scott continues his discussion of the silver
question, under the well-known caption of
"Hard Times," and an Irish member of Parlia
ment has something to say regarding the Irish.
question that will interest all Irish-Americans.
An ex-Presidential elector contributes an arti
cle on the workings of the Electoral College
that is apropos of the nearing election. Ar
ticles of local historical interest are Hon. Wil
liam Everett's story of R. H. Dana and Starr
King, and Arthur Inkersley's description ot
the first college in San Francisco. Articles of
a political nature embrace Charles E. Naylor'a
"Unwise Taxation on Shipping," Charles A.
Lane's "The Gold Miner and the Silver Ques
tion," Judge Waymire's "The Republican
Party and the Farmer," and Arthur J. Pilla
bury's "Final Word."
Frank Leslie's Popular Monthly for Novem

DAME FASHION'S FANCIES IN GOWNS FOR THE SEASON'S DEBUTANTES
Tulle, Chiffon and
jVlousseline de Soie fire
in Higii Favop
How busy most of us are at this season
of the year ordering and selecting hats and
bonnets, gowns and wraps of every de
scription, to say nothing of Jhe hundreds
of little things, all of which demand our
serious attention. Everywhere clothes are
under discussion, the stores are crowded
and the dressmakers rushed to death, just
as though we were not nearing a political
crisis, and already we hear of numerous
luncheons, teas, receptions and dinners
â¢which will be given in the near future,
and socially it is predicted that the
season will bo gay enough to please
even the most pleasure-loving of the de
butantes, aud certainly those who have
joined half a dozen dancing clubs will
stand a good chance of being thoroughly
tired of dancing before they see another
season. lam glad to chronicle the fact
that several of our future belles have
taken a leaf from the books of their New
York cousins and will not appear in
silks, satins and laces, such as their
mothers might wear, but will, in
stead, wear charmingly simple frocks
of chiffon, monsseline de soie, crepe lisse,
tulle and the most exquisitely fine mus
lins, all of which, of course, must be made
over either glace taffeta or satin. Not by
any means inexpensive are such gowns,
Dut they are very lovely and enhance the
charms of bright, Iresh faces. At a card
party recently I asked one of the
most critical men in the City which
of the young girls he considered
the best dressed. He unhesitatingly
replied, "The one in pale green," and he
was perfectly correct. This pretty belle
(3he has seen more than one season)
was quite charming in a pale green or
gandie, sprayed with a small leaf in a
darker shade. The full skirt had three
narrow ruffles, edged with black Valen
ciennes lace, and the elbow sleeves were
composed of four short frills. Adeep corse
let of black satin was finished in the
back with a large bow of black satin, and
Lad long ends, reaching the hem of the
skirt, and the entire Jrock was built over a
glace taffeta silk, just one of those little
French dresses we so seldom see, as
many, when trying to reproduce
Euch models think, for instance, that
satteen can take the place of silk,
and as a result, leave frocks that hang
wretchedly, for how can a satteen which
is soft and clinging in nature, take the
place of taffeta or satin? and some have
even tried rustling linings, with yet
worse results, for cambrics and all the
stuffs are conspicuous on account of
the dreadful rustling sound they make â
like the crinkling noise of much brown
POORHOUSE IN A PALACE
Peculiar Story of arv Old-Tinr\e
JMilpitas Millionaire
The finest almshouse in the world is,
perhaps, the one belonging to Santa Clara
County and located at Milpitas. Indeed,
the place is a palace and was at one time
one of the most elegant residences in Cal
ifornia.
That was long ago, bnt not long enough
to efface the grandeur of the old manor.
The decorations on the walls and tl.ie
magnificent woodwork retain their original
beauty. The grand portico, with its
classic colonnade, remains as it was in days
pone by, to be enjoyed now by the paupers
of Santa Clara County. Favored indeed
are the helpless poor when they can find
surcease of their miseries in the old palace
near Milpitas.
The story of this house is like a romance.
John O'Toole is the name of the man who
built the palace. He was once a million
aire, looked up to by all the country
round. Now he is reduced to extreme
poverty and likely soon to occupy, as a
pauper, the house he built for himself
nearly forty years a^o. At present he
lives in a shed near the Twenty-one-mile
House, on the (Hlroy road, and earns his
Jiving by watering horses, being glad to
get the few nickels that are thrown him
for the service.
In his day John O'Toole was a most
exemplary man â Jionest, upright and
liberal to a fault He believed in the
motto, "live a-nd let live" and practiced
ii as long as he was able. In the days of
His prosperity everybody liked him.
When the O'Toole family concluded in
1860 to build themselves a home they left
it all to John and he discharged His duties
like a man. In the first place he had all
of the work done by the day. No con
tracts for him. Each man had his part to
do and he did it well. As a consequence
the house cost ?35,000 and the O'Tooles got
value for their money, for the work was
â well done. Although the structure is
nearly forty years old it is still in the best
of repair. Not a wall has cracked nor a
floor warped, and even the paint holds its
color.
The house was furnished in splendid
style. Costly carpets covered the floors,
and silk and velvet upholstered furniture
filled the rooms. There were pictures from
the brushes of the masters on the walls
and the best books of the time filled the
paper; and now that silk is reasonable
most girls can afford three or four slips at
least.
One fair debutante in a white chiffon
frock over glace taffeta is certainly fetch
ing. It has a corselet of roseate miroir
velvet which divides in the front into two
tabs fastened with little diamond buckles.
A dainty ruche of the chiffon surrounds
the plump throat and the tncsed sleeves
are the same. The chilfon employed is
covered with a silk pattern. This variety
of chiffon is ranked among the most wel
come novelties for evening toilettes, as
they are said to wear longer than the
plain varieties of chiffon ; they seem to be
somewhat coarser in texture, so closely
resembling lisse that it is almost impos
sible to distinguish the one from the
other.
Net is being used in great profusion for
evening gown*, but the simple net
(Brussels) is scorned, for nowadays it
must be covered with steel, jet or jewels in
endless varieties. A blade silk gown
covered with a black Brussels net striped
with hues of silver sequins set closely to
eether in rows of five at intervals of about
four inches has just left the hands of a
skillful dressmaker; its bodice is swathed
round the figure with a bertbe of white
tulle. Round the waist is a corselet of
dark green satin, which terminates in a
large bow in the back. It has long ends.
Very lovely is a creation lately received
from Rouff (the celebrated couturier).
It is a reception dress composed of pale
blue brocade slightly draped in front, and
caught up at the side. The back has a
large Watteau pleat and the sides opening
over a brocaded petticoat aro artistically
adorned with a cascade of point d'Angle
terre. The upper portion of the bodice is
f ormed with a casaquin of chinchilla, con
tinuing on to the sleeve, and wnite satin
revers embroidered with gold and scin
tillating stones, half hidden beneath a fall
of lace, complete a most satisfactory dress.,
From the same house comes a costume
in a delightful tone of cloth, which is
known as blue - hussard. The entire
bodice is covered with Irish guipure, in
tersected with bands of zibeline similar to
those upon the skirt, crossing at the back.
The waist and throat are finished off with
straw-colored velvet, dotted with black
spangles, terminating in a butterfly bow.
A ball dress, also from Rouff. is a truly
charming toilette. It has the effect of a
princess ve3t and is composed of ivory
white satin.
Felix has just completed a princess robe
in velours craquele ecaille. Down the
front extend two stripes of galon sparkling
library. Mnsical instruments of all kinds
were scattered about the house.
The O'Toole family moved into the
palace looking forward to long lives of
pleasure and happiness. Why should they
not? There was everything that could be
desired â health, wealth, broad acres of
land around a magnificent home located
in a climate like paradise.
Bnt like many other similar cases in
history "there was no luck about the
hous?." The costly place was a hoodoo.
Nothing went right. In a few months
there were estrangements between the
members. of the family, so that they would
pass each other in the halls without speak
ing. Then they began to ecbeme against
one another and in a short time to quarrel.
The quarrels were bitter and hot, and it
is said that on mote than one occasion
blows were exchanged. One faction occu
pied one part of the house and the rest
another. As was natural under such cir
cumstances things went from bad to worse.
The business was ill-managed and the
wealth gradually dwindled until-there was
little ready money to be had.
When the split-up came, after only a few
years of life in the iioÂ»ne of which so
much was expected, there was scarcely
anything to divide. John had the most,
but he acted liberally, taking the house as
part of his share and giving the others
money so that they could start life else
where. Those of the family living at
present are engaged in menial occupations
in different parts of the State.
For a time John occupied the palace
alone and then closed it up and iived a
Bort of unsettled life. The mansion re
mained empty until 1884 at which time
Santa Clara County bought it and 100
acres of the land for $15,000. This sum
was enough to pay John's debts and keep
him a few years, but ho is now reduced to
absolute poverty. That he has not reached
the almshousa by this time is due to the
kindness of a distant relative who permits
him to water Horses.
At present the old mansion is one con

coed parlor that contains a marble mantle,
the cost of which was $800, there are six
cheap iron cots occupied by as many wrecks
of humanity. The -coarse bedding is scat
tered around and the old fellows use the
mantie as a foot rest. In front of the
mantle and concealing some of its beau
ties there is a cheap iron stove, badly
rnsted, with a battered pipe leading to a
hole that has been cut for it in the painted
wall. , The generel effect of the old
mansion is that of a rich home captured
in war-time and made to do service as a
hospital. Everything in the house seems
out of place, even the rough shoes of the
inmates on the polished floors. Probably
the old fellows do not appreciate their
surroundings and might feel just as com
fortable in some of the surrounding sheds.
Bnt as well as being a palatial alms
house in the matter of construction, the
Santa Clara institution at Milpitas is a
model in other respects, and the inmates
are, with few exceptions, a contented and
happy lot. Few indeed are the working
people of the wojld who are so well fed
and cared for. There are about 150 in
mates at present, raneing in age from 65
to 95. These, with one exception, are men.

of the house have grown very tall since
the days when the O'Toolos lived there,
but otherwise it looks much as it did when
in its jrlory.
Perhaps the old wrecks of humanity
lounging around do not add any to the
beauty of the grounds, but they are com
fortable and prolonging their lives, which
i 3 the purpose of the institution. Little
worK is required of the inmates. All they
have to do is to sit in the sun and grow
old. And they can take their own time
about doing it. Some of the inmates have
been in the institution ever since it started,
and with the fine climate and the good
living they get they may attain great ages.
In fact, they are said tob6 in better health
now than when they entered.
Among these inmates there are oi course
many odd characters. Most of them have
been wealthy at one time or another and
look upon their present home as their
right in more ways than one. Few of
them seem to think that they are public
charges. Some of the cases are sad, some
pathetic and a number ludicrous.
Tiiero is only one woman on the place
and she is there with her husband, Antone
de Costa. They are French and can
scarcely speak a word of English, but they !
are as happy as can be. The man is over |
with many-colored jet. There is a neck
band, a bow in the back and bib-like lapels
in ruby velvet and guipure ficelle, en
livened with variegated trimming. The
small revers and a queer littJe tab are of
white satin covered almost with an em
broidered design carved out with gold
thread and ruby-colored silk. Jet fringe
completes it.
Another gown especially ncted is spoken
of as a "distingue gown" in black moire
lamee green, elaborately trimmed witn
80 and they act like two doves in their
devotion to eich other. They have had a
hard time all their lives and have at last
realized what is to them a pleasant hom6
in the Santa Clara County Almshouse.
The oldest men on (he piace are Mexi
cans and they are exceedingly well con
tented. Their ages are not known, but
the chances are that most of them are
over a hundred. None of them have much
to say, but they always get their meals at
the regular time.
Some of the inmates are slightly infirm
mentall}- and have queer ideas. Some
want medicine all the time and of course
they get i(, but not always what they think
they are getting. A number in the insti
tution have small pensions and as regu
larly as it arrives they get rid of it as fast
as possible m the manner dear to them
selves. Some of the inmates expect for
tunes to arrive almost any day and look
forward to the time when they will be able
to shake the dust of the poorhouse from
their feet and go out in the world and fight
some of its hardest battles. Many ot those
most hopeful already have one foot in the
grave, but stand np and say "There is life
in the old dog yet."
One feature of the Santa Clara Alms
house is the fact that all tramps who come
by and ask for food are given it. It makes
no difference how often they call they are
provided with the same as the Inmates
get. The strance thing is that few of
them come more than the second time,
although there are a number who will call
once a month regularly. Within the last
four years of free trade there have beer
about 30.000 meals issued to hungry wan
derers. The number varies from 300 to 900
a month.
Ar\ Improved Respirator.
A valuable prize has recently been
awarded by the French "Society for the
Prevention of Accidents in Industrial
Pursuits," for the best form of respirator
produced, to Dr. Detourbe, whose design
has now been adopted in quite a number
of the most important workthops in North
ern France. The arrangement i.s a mask
shaped to lit the lower half of tne face,
bnt not to interfere with the wearer's
vision; a chamber in the middle, which
projpets a slight distance from the rest of
the mask, contains a layer of asbestos and
also one of cotton or wool, arranged
between small plates of aluminum gauze.
The mask is of copper, and a strip of
elastic felt runs around the innÂ«*r sur
face near the edge, thus insuring the
necessary contact all around, and the
device is held on with lieHt elastic bands
encircling the head, one being on a level
with the forehead and the other about
opposite the lower lip. The orifice is of
such a siz?, and the lining of the chamber
so loosely packed, ttiat the wearer of tho
appliance is enabled not only to breathe,
but to talt without difficulty, these two
points constituting the great advantages
of the invention.
Millions of petrified Fish.
For a score of years, it is said, geologists
have known of the existence of millions
of immense beds of shale in Wyoming
which occasionally yielded fine specimens
of fossil fishes, but it is only recently that
similar beds have been discovered in
Colorado. These beds of petrified fish,
containing millions upon millions of
individual specimens, cover hundreds
of square miles in the north
western part of the State. They extend a
distance of 100 miles in the direction of
Green Kiver and "shelve out" for 100
miles more toward the interior of the
State, In some places these bedsâ almost
a-solid mass of i>erfect)y fossilized fish â
are from 150 to 200 feet in thickness. One
of the greatest puzzles regarding the find
is the fact that they lie about 8000 feet
above the sea level.

ANCIENT MILL AT NILES
JMor\\jnr\ei\t of the Days Before tke
Gomirvg of the yarvkee
History does not record the date of the
construction of the hrst flour mill within
the borders of California, but it is very
likely that the building is still standing
in a good state of preservation. At any
rate the structure is a most interesting one
and is known to have been put up long
before the Americans came to the State.
The structure referred to is located just
to the south of the railroad track and
within the corporate limits of Niles. It is
a quaint old adobe, but stands so close to
a large mill that was put up in 1860 that it
is almost hidden from sight. Tne larger
building, although constructed nearly
forty years ago, is referred to as the "new
miil" by the people living in the vicinity.
It is known that the old mill was built
OLDEST MILL IN CALIFORNIA.
by Don Jesus Vallejo, brotner of General
Vallejo, but the exact date can only be
surmised. He even lost track of it him
self, but the mill was running several
years before he moved into it as his home.
That was about 1835, as near as can be as
certained.
Victor "W. Nuttman, the oldest resident
in Niles, says that when he moved to tbat
locality in 1852 the mill was an old struc
ture and that Don Vallejo told him it was
built over twenty years. This will placo
the date close to 1830, although it is not
improbable that it was built before this.
However, this is as close as can be ob
tained, and is before the construction
of any other building of the kind of which
there is any record.
The old mill is at present occupied as a
residence by Don Manuel, a Spaniard, and
has been changed very little since the days
when it ground wheat for all the country
round. In tact, one might say that it
ground for all the State. It surely ground
for the soldiers at the Presidio of Sonoma,
and there is no doubt but that it did for
other places.
The building is about 30 feet wide and
100 feet long. One end was built to be
used as a residence and the other as a mill.
This part is two stories high and the
framework of the old millstones is still in
place. The mill was operated by water
power and the old run and part of the
wheel is still where it was placed over
sixty years aÂ«o.

With this costume is to be worn a black

foliage; on the other, large ivory satin
bows. The effect of this beautiful toilette
is novel and most attractive.
The beautiful c^oak illustrated is of vio
let velvet of a peculiarly rich shade. It is
lined with ermine throughout, the yoke is
jeweled with amethysts, and the cape is
arranged with rows of Russian sable, edged
witn ecru lace. The effect of the rows of
beautiful fur and ecru lace is nov?l and
most becoming to the wearer. The up
right collar is lined with ermine and pro
tects the baclc of the head. Altogether, it
would be impossible to imagine a hand

On her first appearance in Scotland the
Czarina was gowned all in white, her
dress being embroidered on the cuffs and
coilar with a little gold braid artistically
applied; her cape, of heaviest white silk,
was without ornamentation. When she
attended service at Craithie church with
the Queen, her toilette is said to have had
a considerable touch of color about it, and
indeed, must nave, as her dress was of
dark green, her cloak plum colored and
in her hat white trimmings predominated.
While in Paris the Czarina ordered a com
plete set of sables, which are reported to
be truly magnificent. Marcella.

Smartly dressed men have given up the

is now worn with evening dress.
Concerning the Prince of Wales, a New
York correspondent states his latest

Manuel is still a typical Spanish home.
The ceilings are of heavy beams and the
walls of the old-style cement, so quaint
and picturesque. Big fireplaces are in
most of the rooms. The floors are of
heavy boards, most likely cut by hand be
fore the days of sawmills. The outside of
the building is as picturesque as possible.
The walls are overgrown with vines and
the roof has taken on a soft tone from a
heavy growth of moss.
In spite of its age the walls of the build
ing are in perfect condition and should
stand for ages. All things considered, the
old mill is as interesting a pile as can be
found in the State. It is, of course, not as
historical as many other structures, but it
takes one back to a time when this country
was a wilderness and the men who after
ward made it what it is were children.

pockets. The waistcoat is long and has

unfastened. The tailor litterateur who
bestows on us this bit of news says the
Prince is very careless and that his clothes
are seldom pressed. I nave only
cited ' this item a Ban exam pi ei
possibly, for middle-aged fat gentle
men with youthful aspirations, who may
find a suggestion in this attire of the once
leader of London fashion. It seems the
Prince has followed the example of New
port, and has banished the high hat at
midsummer garden parties. London's
season is the opposite to ours, and I think
the sooner men wear sensible clothes in
midsummer the better. Nearly every one
at Newport wears a lounge suit during the
day, even for calling, and, unless at wed
dings, one rarely sees the top hat during
the months of July and August.
I hear from London direct that the
Prince has again given an order to (he
Spital fields weavers for brocades to be util
ized for evening waistcoats; so we will
doubtless hear a good deal on this topic
later on, as waistcoats have been under
animated discussion every season lately.
On several occasions while in England
the Czar wore a black frock coat aud vest,
gray cashmere trousers and a light tie
knotted sailor fashion.
The leading New York tailors are said
to be overstocked with rough goods in
shades of brown. As a result, brown is
destined to be avoided by the best-dressed
men. A subscriber to Vogue writes:
"Should a covert coat â quite short and of
light color â be worn with evening dress?
If yes, I presume I am correct in suppos
ing that a silk hat can also be worn with a
covert coat at any time."
A very short covert coat should not be
worn with evening dress, especially if the
tails of the coat would show below it. A
covert coat can be worn over dinner jacket
and semi-evening dress, and an Alpine or
Hombourg hat of brown or gray, or again,
a stiff derby. But never wear a covert
coat and a high hat. It is a little too
much on the principle of the Broadway
Rialto. If you must wear your covert
coat with your evening dress â in default
of another overcoatâ then wear a derby or
an Alpine, just as if you had on semi-even
ing dress underneath. Anything to avoid
the combination of a top hat and a short
covert coat.

wheel, but it is in the rear wheel that all
of the power is developed.
Instead of being journaled to an axle
and hub the rear wheel is of the friction
type. The outer tire is of the usual kind,
but within it there is a band to act as a
friction surface. There are several guide
wheels that hold it in position.
The power in this machine is generated
as in ordinary wheels and is communi
cated to a friction wheel by a chain ana
sprocket. This wheel travels on the fric
tion band within the hind wheeJ.
The idea is that the friction wheel can
be made to run four or five revolutions to
one of the sprocket wheel. The friction
wheel then makes two revolutions to one
of the driving wheel and gives it the same
power as itself. By placing the force near
the outside of the wheel there is a gain of
considerable power that is lost in the
wheels of ordinary construction. This
wheel should be a good hill-climber even
if it is nothing else.

C. C.A CONQUEST BY STEAM
TTrip Around tke World Will Soorx
f: Be Made ir\ Thirty Days
â¢.Prince Hilkoff of Russia has been re
peating in the Eastern States that when
the trans-Siberian road shall be com
pleted it will be possible to go around the
'earth by the ordinary routes and methods
of travel in thirty days,
--"I will put a girdle around the earth in
thirty minutes," said Puck.
, ."I can do it in thirty days," is the ver
; sion of the Russian Prince.
'.'â¢ Men connected with the transpor
tation interest in San Francisco,
they who foresee in the compara
tively near future the Golden Gate
crowded with carriers of commerce be
â¢tween Asia and San Francisco, have taken
â¢ out their pencils in the last few days to
' verify or to disprove Prince Hilkoff. The
conclusion of probably the most expert of
Tall these figurers is that Prince Hilkoff is
â¢ entirely justified in his view of the possibil
ities.
.' An interesting feature of this considera
tion is the actual distance to be traversed,
basing the estimate upon the mileage of
existing rail lines and the projected
lengths of that part of the trans-Siberian
road lying east of Cheliabinsk and mak
ing the sea routes coincide about with the
great circles.
Thirty days of 720 hours in total furnish
â¢the lime, and the total distance is, very
.closely calculated, 21,374 miles. The Atlan
tic Ocean distance is 3596 miles and the Pa
t Ocean distance from San Francisco to
â¢ .Vladivostok, the eastern terminus and
port for the trans-Siberian line, is 6325
â¢miles via Yokohama, The distance direct
'to Vladivostok is less than via Yoko
hama, but in making this calculation it
has been taker;, into account that many
steamers between San Francisco and
Vladivostok will naturally visit Yoko
hama en route for trade reasons.
The purpose of estimating on sach a
basis is to reach an intelligent conclusion
â¢ concerning the actual facts, and not to
make a "freak story." It may also be
.premised in this regard that the periods
consumed in land and sea voyages are
estimated on existing time-tables in com
â  mon use, and it is possible to make con- j
nections exactly as set down therein. The
divergences from the actual facts are only
found in giving steamers to ba used on the j
Pacific Ocean, between San Francisco and j
Vladivostok, an average speed of twenty j
knots per hour, to coincide with the speed j
of the best steamers on the trans-Atlantic
â¢routes; also piving railroad trains an aver
age rate of 39,63 miles, which, in view of ;
"trains in portions of the United States and
also European trains making headway of
fifty to sixty miles an hour, cannot be
ponsidered excessive.
Taking then Prince Hilkoffs "thirty
days around the world" as a time esti
mate, the problem, as it will concern San
Francisco not many years hence, may be
.summed up about as follows: I
GOLDEN MEMORIES OF A HERO
Colonel Baker's Words Will Qo Ringing
DoWr\ the /\ges Forever
Thirty-five years ago last Tuesday was t
fought the bloody battle of Leesburg,
sometimes called Balls Bluff. The Cali
fornia regiment, commanded by Colonel
Edward Dickinson Baker, for many years
a resident of San Francisco, but then a
United States Senator from the new State
of Oregon, pot into the very hottest of the
fight, and Baker was killed at the head of
his regiment, fighting with the valor of an
Ajax. He was a "divinely gifted man,"
'as Tennyson said of Garfield. The son of
a poor English weaver, he rose by sheer
force of genius to be the peer of the very
first men in the land. No other face of
that day ever blazed with such rare manly
' bfeauty, and no other voice ever rang out
â¢ peans of freedom to all the world as the
clarion voice of the "Gray Eagle" who
.now sleeps in a neglected grave at Lone
! Mountain.
â¢Thirty-eight years ago on the 12th day
of last September, in the City of San
â¢ Francisco, about 20,000 people assembled
, to celebrate the completion of the first
Atlantic cable, known to electricians as
Â» De Santy's cable, between England and
America. It had been known for a month
that the British frigate Agamemnon and
â  the American war steamer Niagara were at
anchor off the Isle of Wight and waiting
favorable conditions of weather to ' begin
the work so deeply fraught with the hopes
of all civilized nations. But that was a
year before the pony express and three
years before the completion of, the over
land telegraph. So our only communica
tion was by means of ocean steamers via
' Panama. About 7 o'clock on the morning
â¢'of the 24th the steamship Sonora, Captain
Richard L. â¢Whiting,, came dashing into
'"lie bay with a white flag at her foremast,
i: bearing the inscription, ."Atlantic cable
v id." It was ten miles to her wharf, ana
' before she could reach her pier a salute ot
100 guns was being fired from Telegraph
: Hill. Much of the detail work of a cele
bration had' been discounted- before the
steamer's arrival, and so the work of col
lecting money for the show was a very
trifling task.
The procession was a magnificent one,
all the trades, civic societies and other
â¢ organizations being in the parade. . An
ox-team with a covered wagon was a fea
ture of the display, bearing the- inscrip
t-ion, "Give us the Pacific railroad. Don't
wait for the wagon." It was a more
unique procession than had ever before
been given in the State. The fire depart
ment, consisting of fifteen, hand-engines,
three hook-and-Jadder trucks and one in
dependent hosecart, paraded at 8 p. m.
. about 900 men, ail in red. shirts and black
trousers, most of whom were engaged in
mercantile or mechanical pursuits, in con
sequence of which they could not parade
in the daytime. The literary exercises of
the occasion were, celebrated in '.the little
triangle made by the intersection of Bush,
Battery and- Market streets, and there it
was that Colonel Edward D. Baker, after
ward TJnitedjStates Senator from Oregon,
I delivered the oration of ; the day â one of
the most exquisite bits of English compo
sition that graces the pages of our Na
tional literature. In speaking of the part

If it were possible to make close connec
tions by rail and by sea at all points, un
der the existing conditions it would not
mutter which port of departure miirht be
selected. At this time, it is discovered,
after a long and careful study of European
â and trans-American time-tables and cod
nections, that London is the best point to
start from. For the purpose of lending
reality to this trip, whlcn may some day
be a reality, it may be supposed that the
trans-Siberian railway has become suffi
ciently settled and equipped to make it
reasonably certain that all passenger
trains will go through according to the
regular schedules. Then the distances
and route of travel ought to be as follows:

The manifest destiny of San Francisco

the around-tbe-world-direct chain, or
route, this general subject has an ever-in
creasing interest as the trans-Siberia road
progresses steadily and with all possible

that now a trip can be made around the

Baker's strong imagery and exquisite
thought did not stop there, however. A
night or two before the arrival of the
Sonora with the glad tidings of the com
pletion of the cable, Donati's comet blazed
forth and was seen for the first time with
the naked eye, although the great astron
omer had notified the world of its ap
proach nearly two months before. Baker
referred to this in. his usual felicitous
way:
Bnt, even while we assemble to mart the

of his subjects, he read omens of destruction
in the baleful heavens, and prepared himself
for a fate which alike awaits the mightiest and

Do you Warvt Exercise ?
There are many persons to whom the
question of exercise is an important one.
Circumstances are such that they cannot
devote time and attention to athletics of
any description. Household cares or even
ing duties are moro or less confining, and
prevent any indulgence in healthful exer
cises. Perhaps too, they have had to fore
go the bicycle on account of a slim purse
and an expensive famfly. At any rate
there are many reasons that prohibit
many people from keeping up athletic
sports and games. To such persons I
would make a few suggestions.
To begin with 1 have found myself in
just such a position. My great bugbear in
lack of time. Business duties, home obli
gations and the demand on my spare time
through the sky, tho march of a heave n i
messenger along his appointed way and around
his predestined orbit. For 300 years he has
traveled amid the regions of infinite space.
"Lone wanderinpr, but not lost," he has left
behind him shining suns, blazing stars end
gleaming constellations, now nearer to the
eternal throne, and again on the confines of
the universe. He returns, with visions radiant
and benign; he returns, with unimpeded
maroh and unobstructed way; he returns, the
majestic, swift electric telegraph of the
Almighty, bearing upon his flaming front the
tidings that, throughout the universe, there is
still Deace and order â that, amid the Im
measurable dominions of the Grent King, his
ruie is still perfectâ that suns and stars and
systems tread thÂ£lr endless circle and obey
the eternal law.
A year afterward BaKer pronounced his
most pathetic utterance, his funeral ora
tion over David C. Broderick, the great
leader of the Free Soil Democracy, who
had fallen in a duel with Judge Terry.
Broderick's last words were "I am dying
â protect my honor." In his oration
Baker said:
"The code of honor is a delusion and a
snare. It palters the hope of a true cour
age and binds it at the feet of crafty and
cruel skill. It surrounds its victim with
the pomp and grace of the procession, but
leaves him bleeding on the altar. It offers
up to personal vindrctiveness a life due
only to a country, a family and to God.
It substitutes cold and deliberate prepara
tion for couraee and manly impulse, and
arms the one to disarm the other. It is
equal in all the form, unjust in all the
substance. Its boasted equality is a lie."
He closed his speech with (the writer
stood less than thirty feet from him) the
following glowing peroration:
But the last word must be spoken, the Im
perious mandate of death fulfilled. Good
friend, unselfish patient, modest hero, hail
and farewell! Thus, O brave heart, we bear
thee to thy rest. Thus, surrounded by tens of
thousands, we leave thee to the ever equal
grave. As in life no other voice among us so
rang its trumpet tones upon the ears of free
men, so in death its echoes will reverberate
amid our valleys and our mountains till
valor and truth shall cease to appeal to the
human heart.
Beyond Question Baker's speech at
Forest Hill in 1859, a few weeks before the
iatal duel which sent Brodenck to his
grave, was the greatest Republican speech
ever made up to that time.
The scene was a fitting one for an. in
spired orator. The lofty mountains with
their minarets of tapering pines piercing
the tranquil summer sky, the roaring
American River, only a few miles away,
singing its lullaby to the twinkling stars
of the warm summer night and the thou
sand brawny giants with torches in their
hands, gathered about "the old man elo
quent"âall went to make up a picture that
was original in its composition. No won
der, then, that he began with that grace
ful exordium:
I am speaking here in the mountains, al
ways free, and in every age and clime favor
able to the great idea of real liberty, always an
Inspiration to its defenders ana a fortress to
its warriors.
Or that be should have closed it with that
ringing peroration which stirrea men's
souls so that not a man in the assemblage
was seated when he finished it:
My voice will soon be silent, but your
thoughts will remain. They will go forward
and conquer. They are even now gathering
into a streum that shall spread Into a rushing,
boiling and bounding river. They are con
trolling men's minds and maturing their
lives. They are kindllnc men's word* and
freeing men's louls. And as surely as the
great procession oi heaven's host above moves
each In its appointed place and orbit, so shall
the proud principles of human right and free
dom prevail over tyranny and usurpation.
The patriot sleeps within fifty feet of
Broderick, hia slumbers lulled by the
breakers at his very feet that typify his
grand and stormy life. When that beau
tiful cemetery was first opened for sepul
ture of the pioneers it was the most deso
late sand dune between Mexico and
are such that I have had to forego en tirely
those exercises that built up my constitu
tion from a rather sickly boyhood, and
preserved it until at the conclusion of
eighteen years of business life I can truth
fully say that I have not missed a half day
from the office through sickness. How to
preserve my health was io me quite a
problem, particularly as my business du
ties are rather confining. Finally I have
decidee this matter: Dumbbells twice a
day and a stiff walfc over Nob Hill is the
answer to the question. I would suggest
to a business man that if you can swing
dumbbells or Indian clubs at your place of
business for five minutes in the morning
and in the afternoon, seeking, of course, a
secluded spot, you will be as much bene
fited in business as in health.
Then there is another thing which has
been a hobby with me, viz., mountain
climbing. There is not a mountain or hill
of any consequence within a radius of fifty
miles of this city that I have not ascended.
There aie few people who do not feel tha
charm of mountain climbing, and I do not
think that any. enjoy it more than I. To
go infathe country, away from the clatter
of the express-wagon and the fierce clang
of the cable-car bell â
Jo mingle with the universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
One can feel himself a Byron even if he
cannot frame such magnificent utterances.
With my heart filled with such senti
ments and a day off I sought the recesses
of Mill Vali y and the heights of Tamal
pais for a brief season of rest. I admit it
was a peculiar kind of rest, not such as are
usually taken by invalids, at any rate. As
a friend remarked, "I'd rather you would
have the job."
At 8:53 a. m. I found myself at Mill
Valley, and stopping only a minute or two
to inquire the way, I at once struck the
trail and began the ascent. Tamalpais
reminds me of a crouching lion, with cars
erect and extended form. Mill Valley
yOregon, but the landscape gardener's art !
has transformed it into a thing of beauty.
Baker delivered the dedication speech
which the writer has not seen in print ior
forty years, and of which he can only re
call the closing sentences:
Within these now sterile grounds shall bloom
roses and lilies as pure as the souls of the
women and children who slumber in peace
below. Aud within them public reverence
and gratitude shall build the tombs of war
riors and statesmen who have given all their
lives and their best thoughts to their country.
Could the brave soldier and inspired
orator have foreseen as he uttered that
sentence that, m less than seven years, he
should fall in battle, clad in the uniform
of his adopted country, a bleeding martyr
on the altar of freedom? He sleeps in
the soil which his own lips consecrated to
all that is holy in the human heart, and

DO YOU WANT EXERCISE?
Glinr\bir\g Jamalpais a Healthful
Excursion for the Vigorous
becomes the extremity of the right fore
paw and Ross Valley the left. My course
led me up and along the right paw to the
shoulder. In doing this I passed many
nretty villas and shady nooks, while the
rise was very gradual. After a while I
passed the new railroad leading to the
summit, which has lately been built, and
I thought â Richard can have his horse
and the old or lazy can take the train, but
for mountain climbing give me my legs!
Once more I passed one of the many
windings of the railroad, the second and
last crossing. Up to this point the ground
was more or less undulating, the ascents
of course being greater than the incline,
but at 9:10 I descended the last and gentle
slope and began the climb in earnest, for
it seemed as though the path led directly
to the summit. Indeed the acclivity come 3
alarmingly close to being 45 degrees. As
long as the path waa gpod and the atmos
phere cool I was in my element, but the
direct rays of tho sun, the absence of
breeze and my anxiaty to reach the peak
at the earliest possible moment combined
to make it dreadfully uncomfortable. Of
course the latter cause was attributable to
myself, and need not be imitated by those
who climb purely for pleasure.
I will not go into the details of my climb
up the face of the mountain. Sufficient to
say that 1 kept placing one foot in front
of the other and watching the pole on
the summit, and alter sundry turnings
and windings, after many a gasp and
groan, almost staggering with exhaustion,
I stood on the pinnacle of Tamalpais, the
tip of the lion's left ear. But I stood
there only long enough to examine my
watch and find that it registered just 9:45,
having accomplished the distance from
the station in nfty-two minutes. Having
performed this duty I sought a shady
spot, and I wish to say, without hesita
tion, that it was worth all the exertion,
and more too, to lie there in the presence
of that magnificent scene and feel the gen
tle breeze, like some Oriental slave, fan
my heated face.
Of all the cities on this continent of
equal or greater population San Francisco
is unquestionably the most favored in
point of scenery. New York, Chicago,
Philadelphia, St. Louis and New Orleans
are distressingly flat, while Brooklyn,
Baltimore and Cincinnati have few rises
of ground that would compare with Nob
Hill at the greatest. Montreal, which is
inferior in population to our own City,
has a respectable hill behind it, much
like Mount Olympus, south of Golden
Gate Park, reserved by the city for the
public and much enjoyed by them. But
of all these cities not one possesses the
gift of scenery which nature has lavished
on our favored City: Twin Peaks, 925
feet above the level of the sea, at the head
of Market street, easily accessible by a
fairly good waiker from the Haight-street
STOCKTON'S NEW GIRL A GEM
Jke Little J^laiden Has Solved a problem
That Perplexes Millions Jo-Day
How to make money is a problem that
i 3 puzzling old and wise heads all over
the country just now. Up in Stockton
there is a little maiden â the very newest
kind of a new little woman â who has
solved it to her own satisfaction. Her
name is Hilma S. Carlson.
Hilma is a happy, healthy, energetic
specimen of California childhood. Her
hair is sunny ana so is her disposition,
and she ha 3 big blue eyes, bright, intelli
gent and expressive. That she is a worker
in the world in which she has had scarcely
more than a dozen years' experience is
proven by the fact that solely through her
own enterprise and exertions she has over
$100 in bank credited to her name. She
earned it by selling The Call.
About a year ago, Hilma, who has
enough ambition for half a dozen girls of
her age, concluded that when she crew
up she would like to be a physician. At
j cars; San Bruno, somewhat to the south
on the border of the county line, 1000 feet;
Grizzly Peak, across the bay, behind
B?rkeley, at the summit of the Oakland
range, 1925 feet; Tamalpais, on which I
stood; Mount Diablo, to the east, reared
its massive form, its crest towering 3876
feet in the heavens, and far off to the
south Mount Hamilton could be seen, on
the summit of a considerable range, 4400
feet above the level of the bay. All these
can be seen from one of the higher hills
of our City, and of course at a great ad
vantage where I lay in the delightful at
mosphere. Then turning my face to the
north the great bulk of Mount St. Helena
rose before me at an altitude of 4843 feet.
Descending from the left ear of the
mountain I passed the pretty little hotel
that has recently been erected for the ac
commodation of sightseers and wended
my way to the hump of the Jion. After
quite a walk I stood on the highest point
of the entire mountain. Here I found
lour pillars, each about three feet high
and about eighteen inches thick. I
mounted the one that seemed on.higber
ground than the others and mused: "They
say that this mountain is 2597 feet high.
If so then this pillar is fully three feet,
therefore we will call the peak 2600 feet
above the level of the ocean."
While on the way I obtained a beautiful
view of the lake which supplies San Rafael
with water, nestling in the strong arms of
the mountain and drawing its nourish
ment from its veins. Then to the north
Point Reyes plainly visible, and far off in
the distance, like a drawn sword, was
Tomales Bay. Around me was a wilder
ness of chaparral, clothing the sides of the
mountain, while in the canyons at the
base ana on the sides of tbe mountain
were heavy growths of redwood. While
perched there gazing around at the wild
and beautiful scene I recalled that mag
nificent phrase of our California poet,
Lucius H. Foote, in describing the tre
mendous disorder of the Sierras where he
speaks of "the petnlied commotion.' 1
Returning to the eastern crest I sat
down for an hour, thi3 time in the sun, for
I was cooled off and found the soft beams
delightful. With the glorious landscape
spread out before me I reclined in silence,
enjoying the scene through the medium
of eyes and nerves.
Finally I aroused to the fact that tha
shadows had long since turned toward the
east, and after a few "longing, linsering
looks behind" I took my way down the
trail whence I had come and after
| a time found myself once more in the clas
sic shades of Mill Valley. An hour spent
there was a most interesting and profitable
one, and taking a much earlier train than
I expected I arrived in the City, having
spent one of the most delightful daya of
the year and anxious that others should
do the same. Geo. D. Baied.
school she cared more for physiology than
for any other Ettidy, and read with the
greatest eagerness everything that she
could find partaining to that subject. Be
ing a wiso lassie, she knew that a medical
education could not be had lor the asking,
and realizing that her father would have
quite enough to do in years to come if he
cared for and educated her two younger
sisters and brother, Hiima decided to
ca ve out her destiny with her own
small hands. So she brought her
active brain and her equally active
feet into requisition and started out
to compete with the newsboys who were
selling daily papers on the stveet. She
has been competing with them ever since.
Whether any of them have five shining
twenties in bank to show for their labors
does not transpire, and Hilma is too busy
acquiring the fund that is to graduate her
from a medical college one of these fine
days to inquire.
It may easily be imagined that a child
who developed a serious ambition so early
in life and who persists in following the
course she has marked out for herself as a
child of remarkable mental caliber. Hilma
reads with avidity everything that
she can find, which contains solid in
formation, and is deeply interested, in all
scientific subjects. She has some very
original and practical ideas on industrial
topic?, ana think thai parents make a
great mistake who allow their children
to waste their time in mere play. The
dignity of labor appeals to her strongly,
and she is never so happy as when she
counts her gains in nickels after a suc
cessful day's sale of papers.
"Why do I sell The Call?" she re
peated in answer to a question. "Why,
because I lilce it better than any other
paper, and so does papa. And then it sells
faster. My customers say they like to
take it home to their families. I s'pose
that's because it isn't sensational. No, I
don't care to sell any other paper. The
Call is my mascot," and away she darted
to make another sale, her childish young
voice arresting the attention of passers-by
as she passed along the street, a pretty
picture in a dainty white frock.
Hilnia is a girl of many accomplish
ments, and her parents are very proud of
ker, as indeed they may well be. She can
cook a dinner quite to perfection, can
sweep, dust and sew in the most approved
fashion, and has decided musical ability.
She is her mother's mainstay, and her
father's, too, for that matter.
The latter is an industrious tradesman
who conducts a clothing-store, and once,
when he was away for the greater part ol
a week, Hiima took full charge of the
shop, selling shirts and other articles of
clothing as easily as sho disposes oi her
Cai-ls. While she i 3 waiting for the daily
train to bring the papers from San Fran
cisco, she employs her time in making
buttonholes for :he store, and has fre
quently finished fifty in one lorenoon.
The moment that the papers arrive she
is ready for business. Her father doea
not allow her to enter the stores or go on
side streets. Sue sells only on Main
street, which, is Stockton's principal
thoroughfare.
If you should travel to the Slough City
you will be sure to see a modest, well-bred
and sweet-faced little girl with a buudie
of papers under her arm. And if you
drop a nickel into her slim brown hand
you will have the satisfaction of knowing
that you have done your share toward
making brave little Hiima's college dream
a reality.

HIS NAME
WAS
HAYSEED
Jhe Outside Was JRough, but
Within Was f ure Qold
JE.VXIE C. HOLMES, IX OCR BOYS AND QIELB
'What is your name?"
"Hayseed."
"Your name, my boy" ; there was a
touch of sternness in Miss Armstead's
manner. She was the new teacher and
was taking the names of the scholars.
"Hayseed," again said tha boy-
There were no signs of intentional disre-
Fptct in the freckled face uplifted to an
swer her question, but surely he was not
giving his name correctly. Miss Armstead
thought. She glanced around the room,
but there were no smiles on the faces of
the other scholars.
"Your full name," she said once more.
"Hayseed, ma'am," he replied.
"Have you brothers and sisters?"
"Yes'm."
"How many?"
"Sixteen."
What stories was this boy telling her,
she wondered.
â¢â¢Are they all named 'Hayseed?' "
"Oh, no, ma'am; I'm the only one
named Hayseed."
Evidently no disrespect was intended
and she must seek an explanation else
where. At recess she called one of the
older boys to her.
"Please tell me the name of the boy who
calls himself 'Hayseed.'"
"Why, that's it; just 'Hayseed.' You
see, it's this way; his folks live down in
the lity. They're very poor, and there's
sixteen more of 'em besides ' Hayseed.' He
was born ono Presidential election time,
when Hayes and Tilden were the candi
dates. His mother wanted to call him
Tilden and his father would call him
Hayes; so they named him Tilden Hayes,
and as his surname is Ead and they called
him Haves, why. you see, it just makes
him 'Hayseed.' "
Miss Armstead laughed. It was a very
queer combination of names, but "Hay
seed""it was, or something as near that as
possible in sound.
"Mr. Forsythe took him to live with
him last fall. 1 guess he doesn't fare any
too well, but Mr. Forsythe is going to let
him go to school this summer; only this
summer. I guess, for Mr. Forsythe id a
pretty hard man to worlc for."
'â¢That is all, thank you," said Miss Arm
stead.
Gossip was not to be encouraged in the
slightest degree by her. She had obtained
the desired information and the informant
was dismissed, but there was a look of pity
in her eye when "Hayseed" came in after
recess.
He was a forlorn, pathetic little object
to look upon. Hayes had told her he was
10 years of age, but he did not look more
than eight. The face would not have
been unattractive 'ii clean, but evidently
soap and water had not come in contact
with it that day. His hair was light, but
the eyes were bright, and though fnckles
and dirt struggled with each other for
supremacy, the forehead was fair, show
ing what the complexion would be if
cared for.
He wore a shirt that had once been
white, but it had not visited the washtub
for some time, evidently. His other gar
ment was a pair of trousers that some
man bad once worn. The legs had been
cut offâ no other changes had been made.
One suspender held them m place; it was
attached by a single button at the back
and crossed the left shoulder to a single
button in front.
But Hayes was quite indifferent to the
peculiarities of his appareL He could
read; was fairly well advanced in arith
metic; had studied "jography" one term,
but his spelling was a dead failure. It
seemed impossible for him to master the
art.
Miss Armstead was in the habit of drill
ing the more advanced pupils in mental
arithmetic, and one day she gave them
this example:
"Take 6 multiplied by 9 divided by 2
multiplied by 3 plus 9 divided by/ 10
nau^ilied by 12 divided by 24 minus 2
IN
CHILDHOOD'S
REALM
multiplied by 4 minus 6 multiplied by 14
divided by &âwhat do you get as the an
swer?"
Much to her surprise, up went Hayes'
hand, to signify that he had it.
"Well, Hayes, what is it?" she said.
"Seven," said the boy.
â¢'Did you work the example?"
"No, ma'am, I giresÂ»ed it," was the self
satisfied reply.
But one thing that Hayes vras notorious
for among the other boys was what they
termed his cowardice, and "Coward" vras
the name frequently hurled at him in a
contemptuous tone when Miss Armstead
was not within hearing. He never resented
it; if struck by another boy he never Te
turncd the blow. He was a timid boy,
owing more to unkind treatment than to
natural cowardice.
The schoolbouse stood in a very lonely
place, having but one thing in its favor as
a location â it stood exactly in the center
of the district on a back road seldom
traveled, with white birches, alders and a
heavier growth of timber all about. Most
of the scholars came "cross lots" from dif
ferent directions. Miss Armstead herself
came and went acrosb the fields to shorten
her walk, and a number of her Hock kept
her company.
There was a brook which they crossed
on stepping-stones, but Hayes, whose
route home lay that way, would almost in
variably spring up the nearest tree, swing
himself hand over hand from branch to
branch and drop to the ground on the
opposite side of the stream before half the
children were over, and then he v/ould
help the smallest across.
He was always kind to dumb animals.
A mouse had visited the schoolroom fre
quently, coming through a crack in the
floor, and bare feet would be quickly drawn
up whenever it appeared.
With some shingles and a bit of twine
Hayes fashioned a trap, baited it with a
scrap of cheese from somebody's dinner
basket and the next morning the niome
was a prisoner. Some of the boys thought
there would be some sport now in killing
the trembling little thing, but Hayes
thought differenlly. tie kept the little
creature safe all day and on the way home
opened the trap near a barn and the mouse
scampered away unhurt.
Tim Adams cried, "Coward!"
Bessie, Tim's sister, slipped her little
hand into Haves', and with an indig
nant look at her brother, said, "You ain't
a coward; be yon, ' Hayseed'?"
"Yes, 1 s'pese so," said Hayes; "the
boys all say 1 am."
Not lone after this a sad thing happened.
Farmer Adams, the father of Bessie and
Tim, was gored to death by a bull that at
tacked him in his barnyard. Mr. Adams
had been district committeeman and the
school was closed the day of his burial.
Most of the scholars attended the fu
neral, and every night since then, on their
way home with Miss Armstead, they had
talKed of him as they passed his old home.
The bull was kept in the barn yet, they
knew, although he was soon to be sold.
Several pairs of eyes, with looks of fear in
them, gazed at the thick oaken door of the
barn and crowded more closely around
Miss Armstead as they passed it.
Tim and Bessie had come back to school ;
very sad and quiet they were, too. A
week after the terrible occurrence they
were on their way home; Hayes and
several more were with them and Miss
Armstead.
For a quarter of a mile before yon
reached the Adams home a rocky precipice
bordered one side of the road ; there was a |
board fence ten feet in height on the other j
side, which inclosed a plot of ground used \
as a racecourse and also as a baseball
ground. It was only two miles from a
large town, and in summertime the
grounds were frequently in use.
One evening Miss Armstead and the
scholars had gone about half the length of
the fence, when down the road they saw a
cloud of dust moving toward them.
Miss Armstead divined the cause. The
children, with the exception of HayeÂ«, had
not noticed it, but soon a faint, ominous
roar came to their cars.
"The bull has got loose, Miss Armstead,
and is coming for us!" It was Hayes that
said this, but in a very quiet manner.
in a moment the children were in a
panic, clutching Miss Armstead's dress
and screaming. What should she do?
For an eighth of a mile in each direction
was that high board fence which no one
could scale and on the other side that
rocky precipice !
There seemed to be no way of escape.
She might have escaped herself, but she
could not leave those little ones!
In the meantime the bellowing grew
louder. The ball was coming on at full
speed.
"Miss Armstead, come on quick 1" cried
Hayes; "this way; follow me!"
She did not understand, Dut she obeyed
as if he had been the master and she the
pupil. Taking the smallest â one by each
hand â and lellinj the rest to come, she
turned to follow Hayes. Back a few yards,
up to what seemed solid plank, he led
them, and in the twinkling of an eye one
of the heavy planks slid back, leaving an
opening large enough to admit one per
son.
In the meantime the brute had gained
upontnera; they could not hope to get
out of his reach in time.
"Miss Armstead, give me your cape,"
and Hayes had snatched it from her
â houlders and sprung out to what seemed
certain death, directly in front ol the ani
mal.
Miss Armstead believed that her time to
die had come, but she determined to save
her little pupils if possible. Calling them,
one after another, she tumble! them
through the opening in the fence.
She glanced up as the last one went
through, and saw Hayes waving Ler cape
with its red lining almost in the face of
tho bull, and eluding it 3 attack with the
agility of a trained matador. Then she
crept through the opening herself, pray
ing that he might have a chance to run
the distance and follow her, but tie boy
had other intentions. When all the others
were safe, he gave the cape a final toss in
the face of the bull, and sprang to one
side just in time to elude the lowered

horns; then, seizing the limb of a tree
that grew on the edge of the declivity, he
was quickly out of reach.
The infuriated animal now made a
charge directly at the fence. As it did so
one of its horns passed through a knot
hole in a board, which, for a moment, held
it fast. Then it jerked its head back and
the board gave way, remaining fastened
to the animal's horns.
In striving to free itself from this awk
ward incumbrance, the bull went back
against the railing ut the edge of the pre
cipice. This would not stand the pressure,
and the next moment the animal went
over the brink. It was found later, dead;
the fall had kilied It
Hayes' face soon appeared at the open
ing.
"Come on, Miss Armstead," he cried;
"it's all right; he's a goner!"
Thanks to the courage and the presence
of mind of the boy yiey had called
coward, the teacher and her little scholars
were safe.
As for Hayes, he subsided at once into
the same timid little fellow and made his
appearance at school the next morning as
if nothing unusual had happened.
"How did you know about that loose
board in the fence?" Miss Armstead
asked.
"I and another boy crept through there
once to see a baseball game."
The hero was a very human boy, after
all.
"Well, Hayes, nail that board on, and I
will give you a ticket to attend every ball
game that is played there this season."

By OliVe Heuderv
As puppy grew larger he needed more
things to play with and so he began turn
ing boxes upside down in the basement.
In a barrel of old clothes he found an old
white straw hat. He admired that hat,
but he thought it needed retrimrning, so
he took.it up on the porch one day, and
looking at it for some time with his head
down between his front paws and one ear
turned back, he came to the conclusion
that the bat must have something done
to it.
I heard him barking and dancing. I
went ont and the hat was trimmed. From
the slopbucket he had picked out some
big, curly leaves of lettuce and some old
withered flowers, These were piled ail

over the hat and puppy was anxiously
calling for some one to come and admire
his taste. He kept the hat a long time,
trimming it over every day or two.
Puppy knew how to carry kindling, too,
and once in a while when he wanted an
excuse for coming into the house he would
bring a pile of wood upon the porch and
then scratch on the door. Of course 've'd
open it and the wise fellow would put liis
kindling in the box, feeling that he would
be allowed to stay and visit ns a while.
Sometimes we wanted him to carry kind
ling to show him off, but he'd always
act silly, drop the wood on the steps
or chase up and down with one piece
in his mouth. I'd scold him for being so
naughty and then he'd look at me so
sorry with tears in his lovely brown eyes
that I would forgive and pet him.

THE
MAUNTED
CASTLE
PART IV.
Bvj I. M. bobbins.
[PHIL BAHKEE'S VERSION OP THE MYSTERY.]
In this very house, many years ago,
lived a man and his beautiful young wiie.
One morning in the bright summer time
of the year the husband departed on a
hunting trip.
"I shall be home early," were the \v>rds
be gayly shouted to his bride as she stood
with tears in her eyes watching his de
parture.
During the long hours of the day she
strolled through the spacious grounds,
and it so happened that she accidentally
fell into an old well and was drowned.
When the hunter returned he looked in
vain for his sweet wife, but nowhere could
she be found. For days and days he
searched, and finally found her body
floating on the top of the old well.
The poor fellow rushed screaming in and
out of the house to the well until at last,
frenzied with grief, he jumped into the
well and was drowned.
At 12 o'clock each night a rumbling
noise is here heard, and "water spirits"
are seen marching from the old well.
They -go the castle, moaning and scream
ing on their way, but always disappear at
the lir3t gleam of light from the dear old
sun.
Just at the conclusion of this thrilling
tale, ''tap, tap, tap," sounded against
the window-panes; then a low moan swept
through the room. Of course this startled
the merry group, and it took quite a while
forMhem to be convinced that only a
harmless bat wasjthe cause of ail the dis
turbance.
Now, for the grounds! Of course we
must peep into the well! Ugh! it makes
me shiver to think of it. But they did,
all the same. Through the grounds into
the old stable, and beside the moss-grown
well did these happy young folks linger.
(Then for home. The sun' 3 rays were
slanting low, shadows deep were every
where as this joyous band homeward took
i its way through pleasant lanes and mead
ows green, full of happy thoughts about
the wonderful old haunted castle and its
mysteries.

A TRUE STORY.
Twenty-two little turkeys
Were hatched by two hens,
And, one by one, some of them
Came to bad ends ;
Till only six turkeys
Were shivering with cold.
The old hens had weaned them
When scarce a month old.
And now, when the rain comes,
Oh, where can they go-
Each disconsolate turkey,
The picture of woe ?
It was time for a venture,
So the poor little things
Crept up for a shelter
'Neath the old rooster's wings.
That old Brahma rooster
Didn't say, "What a fix I"
But with his broad wings
He sheltered all six.
And not only then.
But the next rainy day,
' He sheltered them all

TIRED OUT.Jr\ pride and poWer or\ EVery Sea
Old Qlory Yet Shall Float
Eight years ago Congressman W. C.
Â Whitthorne. chairman of the House Naval
.'Committee, introduced a bill in Congress
for the establishment of a naval reserve.
It was received with much favor by offi- !
â¢ " cers of the navy, and idur States at once
â¢ took active steps to organize nava! militia
battalions. Unfortunately for this bill,
â¢ which met with such public favor, Mr.
"Whiuhorne's illness and death postponed
â¢ action :md it was not until three years
. later that it was finally passed in a form
â¢not as comprehensive or far-reaching as
â¢ the framer ol the bill designed it to be,
but at any rate it recognized the naval
. militia as a branch of the navy atid small
appropriations were made for its use.
Besides the naval nilitia aireaay organ
! ized in several Slates the law of 1891 pro
vided for the acceptance of steamers to
carry United States mails, that they
â  Bhould be built with a view of being ser
viceable to the Government in time oi war.
It was a very economical measure, which
. secured, without cost to the Government,
. a fleet of steamers suitable for auxiliary
" ' cruisers, and for which privilege European
. countries pay subventions amounting to
'. many thousands of dollars annually.
While Congress was wrestling with tbe
subject, and finally succeeded in getting
' something for nothin â _-, the navy officers
â¢were busy in inspecting every steamer
that could lay any claim to being enrol ed
â¢as an auxiliary naval vessel, and by 1890
'. â¢ the Navy Department was fully informed
'â¢ of the strength of the mercantile marine
as a naval auxiliary.
Since 1891 Congress has annually appro
priated $25,000 for arms and equipment of
'â¢â¢, the naval militia, and small as this sum
is the organization has grown in the sev
eral States, as shown in appended table:

Qlass
Edward L. Geatins. ex-member of the
crew of the United States steamship Phila
delphia, is a much worried man. His
trouble arises from an eccentricity regard
ing the quantity and variety of the food
' he consumes. Not that he is too fastidious
iv this regard, or that, to use a common
expression, he possesses a beer income
combined with a champagne appetite. He
has assured his messmates, and through
them tne world, that the famed feasts of
Lucullus convey to his mind no example
for r.im to emulate, even if he could, and
the gustatory creations of a Briiiat-Sava
rin would not tempt him.
To all outward appearance Mr. Geatins
is much the same as other mortals, but in
what t>.e late Silas Wegg would call his
"inards" he differs. This fact has
brought him into collision with the United
States Government, for, disdaining the
fare provided by Uncle Sam and served in
the forecastle, Mr. Geatins appropriated
and masticated no less than seventeen cut
glass tumblers belonging to the officers'
mess. Having performed this feat in the
record time of ten hours, he looked to a
paternal governm-nt for approval. He
didn't get it, however, but in lieu tnereof
received his discharge. "1 had to quit eat
ins gl*ss," said Geatins, "because the Gov
ernment told me they cou.dn't afford it.
Besides," he added with fine sarcasm,
"they said it wasn't in the contract."
Having quil the service the ex-sailor is
endeavoring to turn an honest penny by
exhibiting himself as the only genuine
glass-eater in the United States. To a
Call correspondent he thus unbosomed
himself: "Yes, I'm not sorry I quit the
service, as on account of my diet I am
really not fit for bard work. Do I eat
anything elan? Oh, yes; coal, sand, iron
clippings and wool. Then I take four
eggs and a enp of coff. c every twenty-four
hours, but I cannot eat the crust of bread
or any Kind of meat. Take yesterday as
an example of my daily meals. I ate
three glasses, four onnces of coal and four
Bpoonfuls of sand. Day before I was feel
ing pretty hungry, so I manageJ to get
away with five glasses and the same pro
portion of sand.
. "How long have I kept it up? Just
twelve years, and until three months ago
I was capable of eatinfj o her food. Since
that time, however, my diet has only con-
Bisted of glass, etc"
Thk Call correspondent offered Mr.
Geatins a cut-glass vessel, which he con
sumed with apparent gusto. A plateful
of sand and coal vanishsd in a similar
manner, whereupon he declared himself
considerably refreshed.
L In reply to further queries he said :
* "I have been examined by professors in
Berlin and Heidelberg, London, Philadel
phia, New York, St. Louis and Chicago.
In Berlin they gave me twenty minutes to
live after a per ormance of eating my

Optician ar\d Oculist
The Lor.don Lancet has taken up the
subject of the proper relations that should
exist between the optician and the eye
doctor. It is precisely because the ad
vances of our knowledge during the last
few years have lifted the whole matter
into the professional sphere, says the
journal, that it behooves opticians to be
chary of prescribing glasses, however
competent they may be to determine
the precise lens or combination of
lenses required. Even in this re
spect there are limitations to their
powers, for the optician would not be justi
fied in employing atropine, without the use
of which in many cases the appropriate
glasses cannot be ascertained. Ophthal
mic surgeons have reason to be grateful to
the opticians for the beauty and perfec
tion of the lenses they supply and for
many useful suegestions they have made
in regard to mounting, and we are sure
that in the long run those opticians will
thrive best who will devote their energies
to the resources of their art. Though
they may be thoroughly competent to
deal with the physical aspect of the ques
tion, additional and special medical
knowledge is required to determine
whether it is advisable to adopt those very
measures which, from a physical point of
view, leave nothing to be desired.
A babouchere Story.
When Mr. Labouchere was at Cambridge
he played a tunning trick on the exam
iners. One of them, enthroned upon his
dais, observed that the young man was
constantly taking stealthy glances at some
document concealed beneath his blotting
paper. He jumped at the conclusion that
he must be referring to some note* which
he had surreptitiously introduced. He
walked over to him and said, sternly,
"Lift up that blotting-paper." Mr. La
bouchere pleaded and protested, with the
result that the examiner was more con
vinced than ever that he had discovered a
genuine case of cribbing. He insisted,
therefore, and the undergraduate had to
obey, and then the examiner discovered
that the only object concealed beneath
Mr. Labouchere's blotting-paper was the
photograph of an exceedingly beautiful
young woman, whose bright eyes, he de
clared, inspired him with right answers
to the perplexing questions which the ex
aminers had propounded.
Diamonds ir\ Hard Steei.
In a recent number of the Comptes
Rendus occurs a very interesting com
munication by M. Rossel on the presence
of diamonds in certain very hard steels.
It was shown some few years ago by that
indefatieable worker, M. Moissan, that
when iron at an extremely high tempera
ture was Â»aturated with carbon and then
cooled under a high pressure, a portion of
the carbon separated out in the form of a
diamond. It occurred to M. Rossel that
the necessary conditions for the forma
tion of these minute diamonds are ful
filled in tne manufacture of very hard
steel, and he has found in the examina
tion of a large number of samples that
such minute diamonds can actually be dis
covered in the steel by dissolving in acid
and subsequent treatment of the insoluble
residue. The crystals, which present all
the chemical and physical properties of
the true diamonds, are of course ex
tremely small.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1896.
Annapolis graduates who have gone into
civil pursuits, and from the many who
have served an apprenticeship in the train
ing and other vessels of the navy, the
country is far better prepared for war than
it was thirty-five years ago, and tlie same
conditions apply to the ships available.
Our makeshift navy of 1861-65 had to deal
with an enemy withont a nsvy and its
functions were chiefly blockade duty.
There are at tbe present time about eighty
steamers available for auxiliary war ves

All summer a man made fiddles in the
back room of a house just off Fourth
avenue, near Twenty-fourth street, says
the New York Sun. Another man who
occupied a back room in another house
used to watch the fiddle-maker from his
window. A birdcage hung in the fiddle
maker's window and a yellow canary
hopped and chirped and sang during the
day as the old man polished the wood
work. When the riddle was ready for the
strings the old man tied them with thumb
and finger, and then when they were
properly adjusted be would take a bow
and draw it over the catgut until tne
sound satisfied his ears. Then he would
play and bend his neck and act as if his
soul was entranced. When he finished
the canary would nearly always dance on
its perch and sink until its notes filled the
area back of the house, and the dweller*
in the vicinity would put out their heads
and listen.
That was satisfactory to the fiddle
maker. He would put the instrument
into a box and it was ready for the mar
ket. It the canary did not sing the old
fidd.e-niaker would unstring the catgut,

rub the wood and replace the strings and
try again and again tin il the canary did
sing. If the bird refused after several
trials the oid man would throw the instru
ment aside and begin on another. One
day the old fiddle-maker was not at bis
work, the window was not raised and
there was no birdcage to be seen. Nearly
a week went by and the situation remained
the same.
The man at the window opposite, who
had watched the work all summer, walked
around to the front of the bouse in whicn
the old fiddle-maker had his room and
asked for the landlord, and inquired of
him what had become of the old fiddle
maker and his canary.
"They've gone," was the reply. 'That
is, the old man has gone. He came to
work one day and found the canary dead,
and he put it in a little box, tied up his
traps and gave up the room. He said he
didn't think he could ever make another
fiddle, for the bird was the only critic be
had upon whom he could rely. He said
when it refused to sing at his playing that
the fiddle was no good. I never knew any
name for the old man except Johanis.
Whether that was bis family name or
otherwise I never learned. I asked him
once, and he said it made no difference,
and I always made out the receipt for his
rent to Jobanis. Sometimes he slept in
the room on a cot, end then he would go
away and stay some other place.
"He was not very communicative, but I
learned a little of his history by degrees.
He was a member of an orchestra in Vi
enna, and his wife was a singer. He
showed me her picture once, in an old
fashioned breastpin. She was young
when the picture was taken and must have
Deen a beautiful woman He used to
write her music and always pkyed for her
when she sang. I never could learn from
him anything about ber fate. Wnetner
she diÂ»'d or whether she left him remains
a mystery to me. But he told me one day
that the canary belonged to her, and that
he brought it to this country; that the
canary was his inspiration â I think that
is what he called itâ and when it died it
seemed to be all up with the oid man.
That is all I know about it."

specially suitable.

That Ends on
November the
Fourth
"It's too bad about that young Metcalf,"
said old Judge Merrill, settling back in his
chair in that comfortable fashion acquired
only by age and long practice.
"Wny?" asked Mrs. Merrill anxiously,
lifting her eyes toward her eldest daugh
ter, who, with scarlet face, had listened to
her father.
"He's lost his mmd â studied too hard
or something â and is doing the most
ridiculous things. No use listening to
him. His father said be talked to him for
an hour the other evening. Gave him a
real going over. Told him he would have
no more nonsense. The young cbap lis
tened to him attentively until be had fin
ished, and then with composure asked
his father to Rive one good reason for be
ing a goldbug; and so it is with every
body. No matter what subject they bring
up he replies with an encomium of Bryan
or a plea for free silver. He is as crazy as
a loon, and crazier. Why, even a loon
wouldn't advocate Bryan's election. I
met him this morning on Washington
street and he wore a huge Bryan badge. I
felt awfully sorry for the poor boy and his
family, but then every family is bound at
one time or another to have its sorrow."
Bessie Merrill, with filling eyes and
drooping, heard the sad story. It did
not seem credible, she thought, that he
who had been so good, so manly, and so
kind, could be stricken in the fullness of
his youth, yet the facts were indisputable.
Her father's testimony only verified the
many rumors she bad heard. And would
it all end thus? Would the love she had
given to young Aletcalf never sift through
bis beclouded brain and bring him light?
For weeks after, ber mind was filled
with thoughts of the convent and the
grave. * * *
The night after McKinley was elected,
Bessie met a bowling, hooting crowd of
jubilants, burning red tire and carrying
bro nip. fcv-e recognized, before she could
read the transparencies, the long-drawn
out Harvard yell. The banners were all
for McKinley, and bearing the largest was
the big square-shouldered form she knew
so well. He saw her immediately, and,
handing the transparency to a comrade,
be pushed his way to ber.
"On, Harry," she said, "I am so glad.
I am really so glad. â¢ After all everybody
said about you and that horrid old Bryan,
ar n't you glad he was defeated? '
"Glad. Never so glad of anything in
my lite. Every one had me down as a
lunatic. My own folks cut me, and the
Kids used to laugh at me on my way to
lectures."
Then be explained to her all about it;
how he was elected a member of the
Dicky Club, and to prove his worth as a
member his courage wus tested in the
way which caused all to think he had
lost his mind. He was to wear a Bryan
badge and advocate Bryan sentiments at
all times and in atl places. It was a terri
ble ordeal for him, but he had borne it
it Is, though, as compared with Great
Britain and France. The coasting steam
ers on the Pacific, especially those of mod
ern build, are but little, if any, inferior to
tie ocean steamers selected, as the
State of California, Queen, Santa Rosa and
others.
The batteries which tho St. Louis and
St. Faiil will carry wiil consist of eight 6
inc'i rifles, six 6-pounders and four ma
chine â¢. uns. The Paris and New Yurk are
to carry twelve 6-inch rifles and twelve
machine guns. As an indication of what
may be expected from these vessels it is
only necessary to compare tbem with
bravely, and the congratulations which
followed the revelation of his real convic
tions partly recompensed him for the
dark days when friendship waned and
lons eluded him like the fleeting lights of
the swamp lands.â New York Sun.
Nature's Paper Factory.
J. M. Johnson of Fresno Flats, Cal.,
recently sent to the office of The Call
what at hrst sight would appear to be a
sheet of machine-made paper, similar to
that out of which Japanese napkins are
made. In Mr. Johnson's letter, he states:
"Inclosed is a sheet of paper, made in
considerable quantities here by the hand
of nature, in the springs, ponds and water
tanks, wherever the water is comparatively
quiet.
"At first, it is & grass-green scum; bat
as ft dries out it bleaches to a whitish
color â a sort of cream white, like the
sample I have mailed to you.
"When I saw it first, I really thought it
was some kind of Japanese paper; but it
proved to be a produot of nature, and
human ingenuity had nothing to do with
its composition. I would like to know,
through The Call, the opinion of some of
your scientists in regard to this rather
interesting matter."
The sample and the facts in regard to it
are certainly interesting. Dr. Qustave
Eisen of the Academy of Sciences, when
shown the specimen in question, observed
that the strip of paper was remarkable for
its evenness and closely knitted parts.
"Of course,'* said he, "all paper is made
out of vegetable fiber â grass and plants.
This paper is composed of green algae, and
is found in still ponds. It is not strong
enough, however, to be of any value."
Professor W. A. Setchell of the depart
ment of botany at the University of Cali
fornia examined the paper, and the result
is thus given in his own words:
"The specimen is the so-called 'water
flannel.' It is composed of the matted fila
ments of Cladopbora, one of the grass
green algae. Professor Hilgard says that
it is fairly characteristic of alkali streams."
Ghar\gir\g the Face of Time.
"The latest" in clocks and watches is
distinctly original. It comes from France.
The sue estion is that the decimal system
should be adopted lor clocks and watches,
bidding good-by to our old friends 11 and
12 o'clock entirely, and to divide the face
of the clock into ten instead of twelve sec
tions. This system is now, used by the
Geographical Bureau of the French army,
and it is urged that it diminishes the
labor of calculation by two-thirds and les
sens the chances of mathematical error
from lour to one. The following is an
outline of the rules of the decimal system
as applied to timepieces:
"The day, from midnight to the.mid
night following, is to oe divided into 100
equal parts, known as 'ces.'
"The subdivisions, according to the deci
mal plan, are 'decices/ or tenths, 'cen
tices,' or hundredtbs, 'mihices,' or thou
sandths.
"One of the main divisions, the 'ces,' is
equal to fourteen minutes and twenty-four
seconds, or almost a quarter of an hour."
This, say the scientists, is the easiest
possible system, but the poor lay mind
may not quite agree wth such a conclu
sion, and 6 a. m. bounds as yet far more ac
ceptable than 25 ces, its decimal equivalent.

Bisnop Wilmer of Alabama was not in
attendance upon the late convention, but
he was well represented by his anecuotes,
which are related by churchmen much as
1 Lincoln's stories are by the general public.
Here is one of them :
One of the Bishop's friends lost a dearly
beloved wife, and in his sorrow caused
these words to be inscribed on her torno
stone: "The light of mine eyes has gone
out."
The bereaved husband married within a
year. Shortly afterward the Bisliop was
walking through the graveyard with an
other gentleman. When th y arrived at
the tomb the latter asked the Bishop what
hs would say of the present state of affairs
in view of the words on the tombstone.

'But I nave struck another mat' h' should
be added."â Minneapolis, Journal.
the larger cruisers of the regular navyi
with somewhat similar batteries. The
Newark, for example, carries twelve 6
inch rifles and an assorted secondary bat
tery of 6 and 3 pounders and machine
puns; the continued sea-speed wouid not
exceed 17 knots and her bunker capacity
is only 809 tons.
The four liners, on the other hand, will
carry a battery equal to that of the New
ark. Their c ntiuued sea-speed for an in
definite period, or so long as the coal holds
out, is 20 knots mail kinds of weather,
and they can stow 5000 tons of coal, suf
ficient for a run of 9000 miles at 20 knotg
an hour. As commerce-destroyers ana
fighters of vessels not Heavier armed nor
better protected than themselves they are
unsurpassed. The only real advantage
which regularly built war vessels possess
over the ocean-liner pressed into service
as an auxiliary war vessel lies in the pro
tection of the machinery and boilers, over
which an arm red deck miminizes the
danger from shot and shell ; in other re
spects the ocean-liner has the advantage,
and Congress drove a very clever bargain
in thus securing from its private citizens
a navy wnich the Government, it seems,
cannot afford to maintnin.
In July last Congress made an appropri
ation of $500,000 toward beginning
the work of making and purchas
ing guns for the auxiliary cruisers, and
the work has just bes:un at the Wash
ington gun-foundry. It will require about;
40 6-iuch, 175 5-incn, 175 4-inch rifles and
nearly 4uO secondary battery guns, con
sisiing oi 6, 3 and 1 pounders and machine
guns. As fast as completed these guns
will be forwarded to the different navy
yards, to be ready when warned.
England deals more liberally with its
private ship-owners, and paid to eleven
steamers $243,000 during the present year
for the privilege of reserving tbem for war
purposes; it pays $1,100,000 yearly in sup
port of a naval reserve, and in addition
pays liberal subsidies for ocean mail ser
vice. Other countries have been equally
lar-sighted, and it is tnis liberal policy
which explains why the number of our
ocean steamships ia so few in compari
son with European countries. #
Taking the steamers of speeds ranging
from twenty to twelve knots, inclusive,
England comes first with 725; France,
125; Germany, 92, and United States 80
Spain has 32, and Japan, a nation of only
recent creation, has 22, which in a couple
of years is likely to exceed our auxiliary
navy in point of number and.quality.

Artists of every country have exhausted
their resources in typifying on canvas
the beauties of the vintage. In all
lands where the grape is grown the hills
covered with vines and dyed by continual
tints contrasted with the purple and
amber of the grape afford such a wealth of
var iegated color as to charm the eye of
the peasant, as well as the cultivated
sense of the artist. The joyous vintagers
with their baskets of fruit and happy
countenances add to the beauty of the
Bcene and make a subject which the
sublimest artists of the age delight to
portray.
What a contrast, therefore, these happy
pastoral scenes of Spain and Italy present
to the commonplace aspects of the vin
tage ia our own Latin quarter of the Bar
bary Coast. Even the most imaginative
can extract no romance or beauty from
the way the juice of the grape is extracted
by the Italians on their own domain.
First, the grapes, instead of being con
veyed to the press in baskets borne on the
heads of laughing boys and girls, are
packed in commonplace boxes, crushed
and wrinkled in the handling and
clumped into an improvised cask until it
is nearly full. ' Into this climb a couple of
stout, big-foited natives of Italy with bare
feet and legs and there they stamp just so
long as a bit of juice remains in the grapes
to be crushed out.
Occasionally one or both of the wine
makers steps out of the cask and walks
around the yard for awhile or goes to a
neighboring saloon for a pot of beer.
Then he jumps back into the press again
without taking the trouble to wash his
feet and begins stamping the grapes aa be
fore.
This method of making wines is cheap
and primitive, but it might not suit a
connoisseur. To our adopte t citizens, how*
ever, it seems to be atl right, and if the)

seive.'drink wines made iv this fashion,
who has the right to complain? As one

THE
STAGE
I fear that 'Romola" will bring more
laurels to the Tabors' brow 3 than money
to their pockets. The production is beau
tifully stagedâ indeed the scenes make
one Ifiink of a gallery of pictures from
Florentine subjects by Dante Gabriel Ro
eetli. But it does not require the wisdom
of the serpent to foresee that with all its
staging "Romola" will never please the
theater-going public. The language 3lone,
largely culled from the novel, is sufficient
to damn it. George Eliot's stately,
sonorous English is about as fitted for
stage purposes as Milton's. On the whole
I think -Paradise Lust.' 1 with scenic ef
fects, wonld make a much finer drama
than "Komola. Tl
But heavy dialogue is not the only de
fect. The plot of "Romola" is a very
nightmare of the stately epic, round
which George Eliot wove so much de
scription and philosophy. 'Tis pity but
'tis true that very few people have read the
novel, and the ideas of the story gathered
from seeing the play were weird enough to
make George Eiiot turn in her grave.
I asked a sprightly damsel who never
misses a new production, and who had ;
not read "Romoia," to give me her con
ception cf the plot. She said .*he had not â 
understood much about it. Perhaps it
was her own fault, because she could not
take an interest in Florentine politics â
American politics were confusing enough.
The love-making between Tito and Ro
mola would have delighted her if ihe lan
guage had not been like 3n essay. She ;
was bitterly disappointed afterward to find
that Tito had married Tessa instead of
Romola, but in the next act she saw, to 'â 
her horror, that he had married them i
both, and not being able to take any fur
ther interest in a fifteenth-century Mor
mon, particularly as he had bored her by
his electioneering for the Medici, she- went
home feeling rather cross and very sleepy.
This young woman is a fair type of the
average theater-goer and the enthusiastic
Tabers evidently have to learn that these
are the people they must cater for. An
actor cannot live by art alone, he needs
t.'ie dollars of the public, and the public
tloÂ«s not want Incoherent plays â outside
farce comedies. I sun sure the subtle de
velopments of character in "Romola" bd
pealed to the'Tabers' artistic sensibilities,
but how about the many-headed public,
which is entirely Jacking in a taste for
Bubtle developments?
Americans are supposed to whip crea
tion, when it comes to matters of busf
ness, but the Tdbers have given another;
proof that Americans don't deserve the 'â 
leputation where their artists are con
cerned. There is the brilliant, erratic
Richard Mansfield. Do you think our
Richard gives a thought to ihe man in !
the box-office when hÂ«? puts on a new pro
duction? You can bet your bicycle that
if he thinks of him at ail it is only to
say, "Blow the box-office. Here A â has
just shown me a new play that contains
a part with fine artistic possibilities, etc."
Richard is tempted by artistic possibilities,
and he falls. Soon after we read the an
nouncement: "Mr. Mansfield's Jatest
production has been withdrawn, because i
the public wa3 unable to appreciate, etc."
I fear the Tabers' latest production will
Boon be withdrawn, "because the public
was unabie to appreciate, etc."
How different is Henry Irving's man
agerial policy! As an impresario, this
cadaverous gentleman has never made a
mistake, probably because, when he is
tempted with a good part, he does not
fall. "Aye, the part tits me, but how will
the play fit the public?' is the question
l lie astute Irving asks himself. It is a
matter of. dramatic history that Irving
always answers the question to the entire
satisfaction of the man at the box-oflice.
The consequence of hi 3 foresight is that
he has money to burn on every new pro
duction, while Mansfield is continually
harassed by financial worries.
The Tabers are young yet. Here's to
their followine in the managerial foot
steps of Henry Irving.
'The little Buckley girl's all right."
This statement was dinned into my ears
t>etween every act by an enthusiastic
gentleman in the rear at the Alcazar the
other night. "My sentiments exactly,
sir!" I longed to remark, but the lack of
an introduction put an icy barrier be
tween myself and the enthusiast. "The
Uglf Duckling" was a very absorbing
performance, so absorbing that I sat and
drank it in, oblivious of the flight of time.
On coming out I was surprised to see the
Orpheuni across the Btreet in darkness,
and looking at the time found that it only
wanted a lew minutes to the witching
hour of midnight. However, that has all
been changed now and the play is just as
absorDing, though the management has
cut it down to permit the audience reach
ing home betimes.
Sharkey attended the Orpheum last
week, and when the comic fighting turn
of the Horn brothers came on the gallery
boys hailed the pugilist from aloft and de
risively inquired what he thought of "that"
combat. It was evident for their own
pare the boys were fascinated with the
bro'.hers' lack of reserve and caution in
coming on to the fray which distinguishes
professional pugilists.
Things really lcok as if the lower ani
mals were crowding out humans in the
music hall profession. We have grown
accustomed to cats and dogs, horses and
kangaroos, as members of the vaudeville
ranks, but now that donkpys and baboons
are going on the stage, whxt is to become
of hard-working human performers? Herr
Grais' little artists do their circus-riding
act very prettrly. When the pause for
light refreshments comes the donkey
munches his carrot and the baboon his
candy with the self-satisfied air of indus
trious performers who earn all the good
things they can get. The only thing is
that with artists of their kind increasing,
the vaudeville profession is not only in
danger of going to the dogs, buc to the
whole of Noah's ark.
What's the matter with hatless ladies in
the theater? They are all right, and
what's more, they are the very women
who have millinery worth displaying.
Since the season opened I have noticed
very few stylish theater hatsâ on ths
owners' heads. The really chic women
take off their hats or wear little bonnets,
but, alas! the women who possess home
made constructions of draegled plumes
and last roses of summer insist on wear
ing the trophies, and such trophies !â some
of them 8 Choctaw Indian would not be
caught wearing at a war dance.
Speaking of hats in the theater, I want
to pay a well-deserved tribute to the com
ing citizenesses. There was only one
man at the Suffrage matinee on Thurs
day, so the clubs have not heard the news
yet; but never was there such an exhibi
tion of hatless ladies in a San Francisco
theater as at that ma'inee. When the
first bars of the overture struck up, off
came the hats, as if on a prearranged sig
nal, and the spectators, even to the outer
most row, were afforded a clear view of
the etage. The sight would have con
vinced any man open to conviction that
nothing on earth, including the ballot,
was too good for those bareheaded women.

Qreer\room Qossip.
Greenroom gossip recalled many traits
I of Henry Abbey last week which were not
mentioned in the obituary notices. "When
I first knew Abbey," said one friend of the
late manager, "he was running Aboey's
Park Theater, New York, and had just
made a big hit with Agnes Booth in that
play where she says: 'Thank God, I can
still eat.' Wiatwasit? Ye?. 'Engaged.'
'â¢Abbey was never known in Europe till
Patti came over to give a concert tour
under her own management; and, para
doxical as it may seem, she didn't go.
Abbey got two of his fritnds to help him,
and they offered to star her. Their first j
concert was given in Brooklyn with a great |
hurrah. The horses were taken out of the
carriage arid Patti was drawn in triumph
to her hote' â all a put-up thing, but it
dazzled ihe puolic. At the end of Patti's
tour the partners had lost $21,000 and
Abbey's r.auie was made. He could go
right over to Europe and get any foreign
star he wanted. Bernhardt was his next
venture, and she was a great draw. It is
hardly probable that she would ever have
come to this country if Abbey had not
brought her, and the same may be said of
Irving, but Abbey introduced them.
"In 1883 Abbey got the new Metropoli
tan Opera-nouse. lit- knew nothing of
music. Maurice Grau had carte blanche
toengage the artists, but Abbey was the
I man who stood on the bridge. He was j
always around the foyer, a fine figure of a â 
man, ready to open a bottle of champagne
with you. or invite you down to his steam
yacht. He burnt the candle at both ends,
during the last few years. Poor Abbey
lived beyond his means end his strength.
He would sit up till 3 or 4 in the morning,
and be up again at 9 to meet his banker.
He held out bravely for a time, but no con
stitution could go on standing it, and
Abbey succumbed.
"A successor? Abbey can't exactly have
a successor. Maurice Grau has always
handled the artists in the Metropolitan
Opera Company."
Signor Abramoff, who sang at the Met
ropolitan Opera-house for several seasons,
says he believes the coming Metropolitan
opera season will be on a firmer financial
basis than during the Abbey-Schoeffel-
Grau management. "I don't think Abbey
made very much out of it latterly," he said.
"Grau, in addition to his share of the
profit?, had a commission from thÂ» lead
ing anists which Abbey and Schoeffel aid
not touch. Grau will be more directly in
terested in the firm now and it will not bo
to his advantagft to permit the payment of
fancy salaries to the artists. I have it on
the Dest authority thnt Grau's commis
sion was 10 per cent.
"Abbey knew nothing of music. His
specialty was moro in handling stars like
Bernhardt and Irving. The advice of his
wife, who had been an actress herself, was
of the greatest use to him in this aepart
nient. As an impresario Grau is already
his successor. "
" 'The Ugly Duckling' was written by
three men who never collaborated," said
an Eastern actor the other day. "I was
in Sew York at the time and remember
just how it happened. Belasco had prom
ised that Mrs. Leslie Carter should make
her debut in a new play on November 10.
He and De Milie were writing a drama for
her, but they were two months behind and
could not possibly get it finished in time.
In hisdilemma Belasco went to Paul Pot
ter and said, 'You write mo the first two
acts of a play in a hurry and I will finish
it' Potter set to work on 'The Ucly Duck
ling,' and at the eiui of the second act he
turned the drama over to Belasco.
'â¢Just as Belacco had finished the third
act he was called away from New York on
important business aud commissioned
Hurry Graham to finish the play. That is
the inside history of how 'The ogly Duck
ling' came to be written, and the play was
a success, though ihe men who wrote it
never collaborated."

Ba IdWin Jheater.
Julia Marlowe-Taber and Robert Taber
will begin the second week o! their en
gagement at the Baldwin Theater to-mor-
row evening in "Romeo and Juliet." The
play will be put on with the identical
scenery, costumes and stage properties
which were employed in its presentation
at Palmer's Theater in New York City
last spring, on which occasion it wai gen
erally pronounced one of the most beauti
ful and complete Shakespearean produc
tions which had been seen in the metrop
olis for some years. The Juliet ot Julia
i Marlowe Taber is ranked by many critics
I in the East as one of her best portrayals.
The entire week will be devoted to
Shakespeare.
Columbia Theater.
"Tennessee's Pardner," acomedy drama,
j will open at the Columbia Theater on
Monday week. No claim is made by the
management that the play is a dramati
zation of Bret Harte's story. The plot
was meiely suggested by the story of that
famous author. "Tennessee's .Pardner"
hÃs been frequently compared with
"Pudd'nhead Wilson," "M'liss" and
"Golden Giant." The characters are
those of early mining days and belong
to the types which Bret Harte has made
familiar.
The company will include Harry Main
hall, Charles B. Hawkins. Estha Wil
liams. Jane Corcoran, "Ollie" Barr and
Annie Mortimer.
Qrarvd Opera-J-iouse.
Sensational melodrama, with an accom
paniment of musical specialties and a
bright soubrette star, is to be the pro
gramme for this week at Morosco's Grand
Opera- house. Florence Bindley' s second
piece, "The Captain's Mate," is said to be
constructed with plenty of the quality
known as "ginger." From beginning to
end the exciting incidents follow each
other in quick succession, with an inter
jection of enough humorous situations
and funny dialogue to relieve the tension
of the dramatic experiences of the various
characters.
The play deals with the machinations of
a band of cutthroats, who kidnaped the
heroine when she was a baby.
The Alcazar.
"The Ugly Duckling" has proved such
a success that the management has de
cided to continue it for another week.
The members of the stock company are
well cast, and John T. Sullivan as Count
Malate3ta, and May Buckley as the Ugly
Duckling appear to better advantage than
in anything they have yet played at the
Alcazar. The comedy roles of the piece
are well filled by Messrs. J. B. Polk, Frank
Doane and R. C. White.
The careful and painstaking work done
by the stock company and the attention
paid to stage setting are beginning to be
fully appreciated.
TiVoli Opera-House.
At the Tivoli Opera-house to-morrow
the second edition of Ferris Hartman's
successful extravaganza, "The Bab^s in
the Wood," will be given. Many new
songs, dances and hits upon topics of the
day will enlighten the performance and
make it in a measure a new show. The
lone-promised burlesque quartet upon
Italian cpera methous will be given by
Natali Crox Seabrooke, De Vries Willie
Hartraan, Michelena Puche, Darcy
Abramoff, Dusty West. The schoolroom
scene will be entirely changed, as will many
of the figures of the march of the sprightly
bathers.
Strauss' waltz opera, "The Gypsy
Baron," wiil follow.
At the Orpheum.
The new acts to be added to the Or
phcum bill this week are said to be strong
additions to the already great bill. Nel
son, Ginsereti and Demenio, the tramp,
the Chinaman and the schoolboy, will ap
pear in an aerial act, the style of which
they are said to have created. All their
work is on the horizontal bars, but said to
be extremely funny. The brothers Detroit
are equilibrists of renown, and are styled
the world's greatest hand balancers.
Mays and Hunter are very skillful with
the banjo, and will appear in a pro
gramme of popular airs.
The three brothers Horn will appear in
the sketch that created, so much talk last
week. Herr Grais with his Imitation cir
cus is on the bill, also Clayton, Jenkins
and Jasper, Colby and Way, Eldora and
Norine, ller, Burke and Belmar, most of
them in new acts.

/U the Chutes.
The Chutes management has secured a
remarkable attraction in the person of
"Arion," who has walked over Niagara
Falls twelve times on a high wire. He
has now perfected an arrangement whereby
he rides a safety bicycle over a live irolley
wire, charged with 500 volts of electricity.
The wir# is 200 feet long and will be placed
sixty feet above the lake. He and his
bicycle are covered with incandescent
lights.
His first ride will be given this after
noon at 4 o'clock, and every evening after
ward he will give his hazardous per
formance. At the conclusion of his en
gagement here "Arion" intends riding a
live trolley wire stretched over Niagara
Falls.

/\ Qreat Finnish _/\ctress Repeats
Jrilby's Experience.
Truth is stranger than fiction, as one
can see almost any day, by reading the
daily papers. But no one expected even
truth to go farther than "Trilby." A
curious event which has just excited Stock
holm, however, is stranger than any of
Svengali's hypnotizing feats. The story j
is told in detail by a correspondent of the |
Pari3 Figaro, and seems to be thoroughly
authenticated.
Says the correspondent: I have just
been an eye-witness of a very curious
{ event. Stockholm, at the present moment,
is applauding a Finnish tragedienne,
Mme. Ida Aalberg (Baroness Uexkill),
who ranks with Sarah Bernnardt and
Elenora Duse. Were it not for the lan
guage in which she plays, she would enjuy
the same celebrity. She is especially ad
mirable in the role of Therese Kaquin.
Having come nere to pive a series of
representations at the Theater Royal, the
condition of apathy and decadence into
which the Stockholm pnblic has Sallen
enervated the great artist and rendered
her heartsick. She had chosen Suder
mentt'a last piece, "GUick im Winckel."
lor her debnt, but on the very afternoon
of the day she was seized with an abso
i lute extinction of voice and an attack of
nervous prostration which sent her to bed.
Mme. Aalberg's friends called in Dr.
j Wetterstrand, n specialist in nervous dis
' eases well known in the world of science.
! He attracted general attention at the re
i cent Medical Congress in Geneva. The
| doctor arrived three hours before the cur
tain was to go up on the performance.
What he did was to send the tragedienne
to sleep and tell her to get up at a certain
moment in full possession of her voice and
faculties. The actress assented to this com
mand, and going to the theater went
through the whole play in a hypnotic
condition. Her acting was emotional, ex
cessively so, but sometimes her exclama
tions recalled the cries that people utter
in dreams. In the intervals between the
passionate moments her voice, although
clear and distinct, was as if oppressed.
In the auditorium I heard people who
were ignorant of what was passing say,
"It is singular; one would say she was
hypnotized." The whole public was deeply
moved by her acting, but it also seemed
to feel vividly that some strange game was
going on, of which it was ignorant of the
secret.
I was witness of the tragedienne's loss
of speech, as well as of the hypnotic sleep,
and I was present at the performance. I
can, therefore, testify to the certitude of
ihe above."
[Translated for The Call from Le Figaro of
Sunday, v,ctober4, 1i;96.]
It may be added that the Figaro's cor
respondent never seems to have heard of
"Trilby."
Sarah's Qrarvd RevWal.
Sarah Bernhardt has revived ''La Dame
aux Camelias" in Paris with the costumes
of 1840. and reports from the tirs + . night
say that the gowns appeared very beauti
ful to the women, but hideous to the men.
Ten years ago the whole audience would
have laughed at the big coal-scuttle bon
net of Mile. Say lor and the organdie dress,
the shawl and the huge bonnet, with
strings, worn by Mme. Grandet. M. Gui
try's toupet would have been an object of
ridicule, and so would the corsets with
which the elegants of 1840 pinched in
their waists and the gilt buttons with
which they studded their coat.Â«.
Â» But the other night the Parisian public
scarcely smiled at these things, and dur
ing the entr'actes Sarah's dressing-room,
which was incumoered with visitors, re
sounded with expressions of admiration
for the costumes. All the ladies were in
ecstacies over the great artist's opera
dress, made of pink silk ganze, wiih scal
loped flounces looped up with rose-colored
feathsrs powdered with diamonds. They
also gushed over the yellow satin mantle
with sabla sleeves, the country dress of
Nile green moire velvet seamed with sil
ver, the little mantle of rose gauze, and
the ball dress of the fourth uct, made of |
lace, f-pangled with gold, looped up with I
bunches of white camellias; and lastly, to j
die ii>, the night robe of Indian muslin.
"Ah. Douce t- made them, my friends,"
cried Sarah. "Who cisc do you think
could have done it?"
People looked at Mme. Grandet as they
look at a box of curiosities:. They walked
round her and round her coal-scuttle bon
net flowering with Marechal Niel ro>es
and lilac and ornamented with authentic
bonnet-strings of flowered taffeta â bonnet
strings which have seen sixty years of j
existence; th^n they walked round the
other coiil-scuttle oonnet, ornamented
with plumes and heliotrope bows.
"I chose everything," said Sarah, :
"Lewis and I. He has made excellent,
reproductions from the old models and
photographs of the period,"
And so in our age, which is always
gaping after novelties, dressmakers and
tailors and modistes have to become
almost historians.
There was some question of playing
"Caprice." one of the spectacles prepared
for their Russian Majesties, with the cos
tumes of Alfred de Musset, but the director
of the theater put his foot down. "The
Empress of Russia won't nave any objec
tion to seeing the latest iashions," he said.
"Mount 'Caprice' with the costumes of to
day, or, better still, those of to-morrow."

The Burgtheater of Vienna has just hnd a
startling success with a new drama in three
acts called "The Athenian." The play is by
Leo Ebermann, a poet unknown till now, but
whose lirst work has caused the Viennese
critics to declare that a great dramatist has
been found in Austria.
The Ne*y York Sun says of "Mary Penning
ton, Spinster," in which Georgia Cayvan made
her New York debut as a star on Monday even
iDg: "The play hardly more than provided an
agreeable role for Miss Cayvan. Like most of
ihe attempts of dramatists to blend business
affairs with love affairs, it was too prosy and
unroroantic to reach the hearts of his audi
ence. â¢ â¢ â¢
The brilliant but eccentric Marie Corelli is

I. ' Explanation.
: Tire arrow ' flies with the wind. The top figures i
' ' at station indicate maximum temperature for :ho |
days; those underneath it, If any, the amount of :
' 'rain.all, of melted snow In Inches and hundredths, j
â¢ during the past twelve hours. Isobars, eft- solid ]
lines, connect poln s of equal air. pressure; iso- 1
therms, or dotted . Hues, equal . temperature. . The
word "hleh" means hUh barometric pressure and
Is usually accomDanled by fair weather: "low"
â¢ refers to low â¢ pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
' "Lows", usually -first" appear ; on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high In the interior
and â  low along I the coast, and the Isobars extend j
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with : Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is Improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coos', warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.' ' â 'â  -

: NTV YORK, N. V., Oct. 24â Lower 1 rices
from London, a break in wheat, and fears of a poor

trading the entire list developed : great strength.
In fact a majority of the leading issues sold at the

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, In-. Oct. 24.â Wheat speculators,
especially those who were so â  confident as 10 buy
freely yesterday, had a rude awakening this morn
ing when they found Liverpool ' off 2%@2%d and
our own curb price Sic : lower than | when they left
for home yesterday. The break .at Liverpool was
entirely unexpected, and being so was all the more
disastrous in Its effect here. After the firsi ex
citement and panic incident to the opening was
over, a little more steadiness developed, but the
least indication of any selling by heavy holders
caused a quick reaction. - The exports from both
coasts for the week were 300.000 busnels less than
for last week, 3.823,030 bushels clearing. . â  '
Receipts In the Northwest were heavy at : 1088
cars against 835 last Saturday and 1146 a year
ago- Chicago received 188 cars and Inspected out
31,700 bushels. Export clearances were moder
ate at 209,666 > bushels. - Cloilns Continental
cables were all higher, reflecting the strength
noted . here yesterday. A second .panic came
about the middle of the session. December wheat
opened from 703/ c to 70c. sol.l between 70% c and
69c. closing at 6it%c, 33'gc under yesterday. Es
timated receipts for Monday 220 cars. :
..-â  CORNâ Cropped In ' price through the Influence
of the demoralization existing in wheat. There

LIQUOR-MEN IN
BATTLE ARRAY
Dealers Are Taking an
Active Part in the
Local Fight.
Are Opposed to the New Charter
and to Woman's Suf
frage.
WILL HfDORSE CANDIDATES.
Certain Supervisorial, Judicial and
Legislative Nominees to Re*
ceive Their Support
Both the proposed new charter and the
woman's suffrage amendment to the con
stitution will have a new and powerful
element avowedly and openly opposed to
them within the next few days, and this
same element will also take an active part
in the election of Supervisors, Superior
Judges, Police Judges and members of the
Legislature.
Never before in the history of the State
have the liquor forces been so well and
widely organized as for this campaign,
and this condition of things is acknowl
edged to be very largely due to the energy
and ability of J. P. Edoff, the president of
the California State Protective Associa
tion, the organization of the wholesale
and retail liquor-dealers of the State, and
also president of the Wholesale and Retail
Liquor-dealers' and Brewers' League, the
organization of the local liquor people.
In this City there are 5000 people en
gaged as proprietors in the liquor trade,
and these, with their employes and vari
tus attaches, represent, it is claimed, a
ruing strength of 14,000 in this City
aUne, and this compact and organized
mass of voters are to be placed in the field
aga.nst the new charter and against
wortan's suffrage. Xot only will these
men vote against these propositions, but
they will do active woxk at the polls on
the day of election to bring about the de
ieat of :Â©th measures.
It is bit little over a month ago that the
"Wholesae and Retail Liquor Dealers' and
Brewers' League was' organized in this
City for tie express purpose of taking an
active par in the local and State election.
Its reasonsfor so doing, as stated by one
of its promnent officials, is to secure the
election of uch officials as will not permit
any unjust discriminations to be made
against the lquor men and their business.
The member: of the organization disavow
any intentim of seekine favors at the
hands of arymen whose election they
may aid to ieÂ»ure, but desire, they say,
Bimply to be ziren a fair deal before tne
Legislature, tieaifferent Boards of Super
visors and Tovn Trustees, and before the
Judges who maybe called upon to inter
pret the laws relsting to the liquor busi
ness.
It is claimed hat measures are fre
quently brought ip in the legislative
bodies of the State^f the various coumies
and of towns and-nies, which are noth
ing more than cinchbills, and which cost
the liquor trade contderabie trouble and
money to defeat. It is to prevent such
contingencies in tbtfuture that the field
of politics is to beentfred by the State and
the local organization 4 the liquor men.
The local organ izaton consists of the
following seven indepndent bodies, and
the conference conimiiee to which is
intrusted all the confideuial and respon
sible business comprise three delegates
from each, as follows:
California S'.ate Protectve Association â
J. P. Edoff, Joseph M. Lotwe, John Wolf.
German Saloon-keepers-John Hagler
Captain giebert, D. B.'Faktcr.
Retail Grocers' Associaxrm â John C.
Nobman, Joan Lackman, J. 3. Harje.
San Francisco Branch N0.2, (Jalnornia
State Protective Associationâ J. B. Yar
land, T. M. Ferguson, W\ T. CBrien.
Brewers' Protective Assocation â C. B.
Stone, F. T. Schuster, H. Wrefcn.
Retail Liquor-dealers' Proteuive Asso
ciationâJ. E. Kenny, frank lann, J. S.
Macintosh.
Retail Grocers' Protective Association
J. T. Hurley, James O'Connor, S. Vock.
Herewith is given the first Cimpaign
circular issued by the literary conmittee
of the conference committee. It is a re
markable document in many respects, but
tells its own story clearly and strongly, so
needs no comment:
San FkanciÃCO, October 22, 1896.
Lear Sir: Tbe Wholesale and Retail Liquor
Dealers' and Brewers' League, which is com
posed of representatives from all the liquor
trade organizations of San Francisco, which
are as follows:
California State Protective Association.
Brewers' Protective Association.
German Saloon-keepers.
Retail Grocers' Association.
San Francisco Branch No. 2, C. S. P. A.
Retail Liquor Dealers' Protective Associa
tion.
Retail Grocers' Protective Union
Will mail you on or before the morning of
November 2 a list of candidates which they
have indorsed.
We would request and urge you, as one who
has the interests oi the business at heart, to
vote for the candidates indorsed by the league,
as much of the futureof the liquor traffic de
pends upon the success of our ticket.
Indorsement slips will be sent only for the
following officers: .
Supervisors.
Superior Judges.
Police Court Judges.
Members of thu Legislature.
Indorsements will be made Irom thit office
only. None will be distributefl by hand. In
dorsements cannot be changed alter the list is
mailed to you.
CAUTION.
Beware of newspaper announcements, as no
Information will be authorized by us, and tny
purporting to come from us will be a fraud
and imposition. Also beware of bogus lists of
indorsements represented as coming from this
league.
Turn this sheet of paper sidewise and hold
to the light. In the paper itself you will see
the words "Premium Note Co." repeated sev
eral times. This is a water-mark. All of our
genuine indorsements will have the water
mark "Premium Note Co." repeated several
times in the paper. Test the seme by turning
the sheet sidewise and holding it before the
light. Any indorsements not bearing this
water-marks are fakes. We have secured all
of this kind of paper in existence, and will be
the only ones using the same.
Vote for the league indorsements and act
upon their suggestions and test your ticket be
fore voting. Our main object is to get men in
office who will be fairly disposed to our inter
ests and whom we can trust.
Should any Derson in our line fall to receive
this notice, send names ana addresses to the
office and indorsements will be *ent. Respect
fullyi John C. Nobman,
John Hagler,
J. B. Oakland,
H. Weeden,
John Wolf,
J. 8. Macintosh,
S, Vock,
Literary Committee.
William T. O'Brien, Secretary.
This circular was the result of the delib
erations of the conference committee held
during the week. During these same
meetings four committees were appointed
to select the candidates to be indorsed.
There is a separate committee for each
class of officers. These committees are to
report daring tbe coming week, but the
list of indorsees is not to be made known
generally until a day or two before the
election. It will require the vote of two
members of each delegation to secure in
dorsement for a candidate, so that two
members of any one delegation can pre
vent the indorsement of a nominee.

ce rs said :
"We have a voting strength of 14,000,
and each of these men is virtually pledged
not only to vote as the association may
decide, but lie will go out on election day
and do all in his power to secure votes for
the candidates and propositions we favor."

or more counties in the State, in which
There are branches of the California State
Protective Association.

THE GALE OPIUM CURE
CURES THE
OPIUM
Or morphine habit. It is a certain, quick and
painless cure. It destroys all desrre lor opl-
aies. It does not cure by gradually reducing
the amount of opium or morphine used, but
by antidoting every atom of the drug in one's
system. That is why it cures so quickly and
thoroughly. That is why it never fnilt 10 cure
and why pntionts STAY cured. Because it is a
perfect antidote for opium, morphine or
cocaine. It does not matter how iong one has
used these drugs or how much, or in what,
form (whether by smoking, hypodermically or
by the mouth), the result is always the same â
a perfect, painless and quick cure. The rem-
edy is a simple herb, as harmless as water.
For diseases of the
BLOOD AND SKIN
It is a panacea. Under its use they fade away
as if by magic
Patients takintr it for the cure of the opium
habit must remain in thp Uale Sanitarium in
San Francisco for one week; then they go
home perfectly cured. The fee deposited in
bank and subject to our order when the cure
is complete will be entirely satisfactory in any
cose. Any reasonable number of references to
those cured will be furnished by applying at
the office.
