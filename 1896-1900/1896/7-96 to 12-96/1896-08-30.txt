VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 9\.
PROTECTION IS THE ISSUE,
Mr. Estee's Speech on the
Causes of Hard
Times.
THEY CAME HERE WITH
DEMOCRACY. .
Big Opening Meeting of the Na
tional League Quarters
in Pioneer Hall.
ENTHUSIASM WITH SPEECHES
AND MUSIC
Democracy Found the Country Prosperous, With
Factories Running and No Trampism.
It Desolated the Nation With
Want and Famine.
If Morris 11. EsteÂ« ever had occasion to ]
feel a pang of consciousness that his ser
vices to . the Republican parry had . not :
been appreciated or, that the Republicans
of California bad been ungrateful, the
magnificent reception accorded him last
night at the Auditorium should convince
bin. that oilcans as well as republics j
are not aivrsya Kill if
Tee boose was crowded with one of the
most intelligent and appreciative audi
ences ever seen at a co'itical meeting any
where. Several hundred people were
turned away- after all tee standing room
had been occupied.
Oscar Lewis, iron founder, called the
meeting to order and introduced Mr.
Estee as "tLat distinguished Republican i
whom you all snow."
When Mr. Estee came forward to the
front of the stage the audience rose to it&
feet and greeted him with two rounds of
cheers. It was a warm, spontaneous wel
come to the old war horse whose colors
had been seen so often in the van. .
Mr. Estee made the speech of his life, !
and was frequently interrupted with put- f
bursts of applause from the delighted an- I
dience, as they recognized the full force of
bis logic. The speech would occupy more
than a full page of The Call, and the de- ,
mand upon the space of a Sunday morn- I
ing newspaper is so great that it will be
impracticable to print the speech in fulL
The following synopsis will gve a fair idea
of Mr. Estee' s argument. In speaking of
the issuance of bonds to the extent of
1262,000,000 by the present Democratic ad
ministration, Mr. Kstoe said:
But what I desire to say Is. it was the free
trader* like Mr. Bryan who made it necessary
to issue the bond; referred to, or repediateour
National obligations. >".-â  Republican f&vored
the issuance of bond- or tae formineof a!
"banking syndicate" (if one was fonnea), nor I
did any Republican make money "by a ex
change of those bonds a: an enormous "profit."
If this wsa done, those who did it were Demo
crats, and are mostly Bryan-Democrats to-day.
In a word, the Chicago Democracy made a i

platform to protect the people of this country
against their owe ac:s, and it was tae best
thing they did. *.â¢-â â¢ â¢
They- stand *: the gates of commerce and
open them wide to let foreigners into oar
country to control American markets, bat
they refuse to protect American labor at home.
Thty hare adopted foreign revenue principles
and have always i d posed protection to Ameri
ca. labor and favored free trade, and now they
denounce oar finaaciai syareia because they
say i: is un-American.
- A*JÂ«r thrf^-ic? oat of fap^Ttsenl'cTer
three millions of American laborers they de
clare they are for Americas labor, but they do
not provide American laborers with one day's
work.'. â¢' â  * â¢ -.-â¢;..
All debts will be gold debts. EilTer will
remain in the future, as it Is now, cheap
so ions; as gold is high and to lone as the in
debtedness to banks and capitalists has to be
j aid In cold coin, because the demand for
gold will increase and the demand tor silver
will decrease.
The man who works for wages and the farm
ers who produce something for sale will be
paid in silver money unless they, like the
bankers, made contracts Dayzale in gold. If
they do this i then free coinage of silver will
serve no purpose, because silver will not be
cs-d as money. Tais cry for free coinage of
silver is thus at this time a political fake and
not a financial problem. â¢ â¢ â¢
Illf we had good times generally and sent no
money abroad, then gold - and silver would
both circulate at home, and possibly at a par
ity of value. But such is Lot the case, and
cannot be the case until we have protection.
Then the laborers will have more to do, and
the increased demand lor workers will increase
the price of work. The means to - pay use
workers comes from the result* of their toil,
and not from the amount of silver in circula
tion. Labor produces things first and money
a:terward, and the price these things sell for
is regulated by the demand. Protect our
home marcet, aud there will be a good de
mand and a good price. The things so pro
duced are the wealth of the country, and
when the things are sold money, as a
symsol of wealth, is paid and received for
them, and to secure the producer a good price,
money should be both good and abundant.
There never nas been a time when there was
more gold and silver money in this country
than within toe last four years, and yet we
are poor and hard times prevail. England is
the richest country in the worid, so far as
mosey eanxaake that country rich, and yet,
with about half our population, it has ten
paupers to our one. | It is axiomatic that well
paid labor makes a country rich, and it is
not the amount of money in the vaults of the
banks or in the pockets of a few rich men that
â hows a nation's wealth. â¢ â¢ â¢
The Popuuiuc Democrats demand the free
coinage of silver so that the amount of our
; metallic money will be Increased. But our
answer is: The free colnaze of silver will not,
unaer present conditions, result In an Increase
of oar metal money, and will not afford a
remedy for hard times, because we cannot in
| crease the amount of our coinage money by
1 coining more saver, for when we coin more
silver we will coin ;Â«Â«â¢ gold. It was officially
stated by the Treasury Department, in Anri- of
this year, that la*t ye*r we coined $43,933,475
in sold and $9,069,450 in silver, a. d that If
our mints were devoted exclusively to the free
coinage of silver we â  would coin $15,000,000
less money every year than now, because it
takes nearly, as much time to coin a silver
dollar as it does to coin a twenty dollar gold
piece; and therefore, we -would coin less
metallic money.
I Forty million dollars a y<Â»ar is the extent of
our possible silver coinage, and Â« c now coin
in gold and silver more than $53,000,000 a
year, and so free coinage of silver will bring
us less instead of more znonev, and worse in
stead of better times.
- I believe in the largest possible use of both
gold and silver, and in the free and unlimited
coinage of both metals, but I am . una.terably
opposed ts either gold or silver monometallism.
I believe in the . free coinage o ; boih these
metals, for the reason that the mere good
money we have, everything else being equal,
the better we are off; and yet nor banks may
be full of money and our pockets empty. Good
money and good times must go together. But
ah dollars must be alike ia value, and when
ever the free coinage of stiver causes stiver
monometallism, this will injure our country.
We cannot have one dollar tor the debtor, and
another for the creditor, or one dollar for the
rich and another for the poor. If we do. the
Tie- will bÂ± sure to get the best dollar. There
cannot be too much good money, but there
' can be too much cheap money. It will be no
remedy to exchange gold monometallism fa;
silver monometallism. Tnere can be no pros
perity in lowering the standard of oar mosey.
Money is not a vbiag one can eat or drink or
wear or use for any purpose except as an ex
change for things, and as a representative of :
value, and ween money does not represent !
value, then it is useless. The benefits derived ;
from money, like the benefits derived from '
the â  use of anything else that mankind re- !
quires, depend on the opportunity for its use, :
and ;he value of the thing used. . 'â¢.-.: .
. No man can. get money no more than be can
get lan a , coles* he exchange* something else
iar it; tor instance, jÂ«o '-an take one hnadrct
pounds of wheat to a man who has money and .
wants wheat and he gives you a dollar for the
wheat. - Bat suppose he needs the wheat; but :
hasn't got the dollar? Then he must work tor '
the dollar as the other man worked to produce :
toe wheat; but in order to work for the dollar
he must have an opportunity to work, and he '
cannot have an opportunity to earn a dollar i
unless there Is something to dc. and there
will not be something to do unless some man j
can make something by hiring this man who
wants to earn a dollar. Then it is the produc- !
tion of things that makes money and causes a
country to De prosperousâ the more things the !
people produce the more wealth they accumu
late. The making of money follows the pro
duction of things; for a people to prosper they |
must- produce a great deal, and the laws that !
most encourage such prodoeÃcns are the laws j
that most Decent the people and create the j
most wealth.
We must have protection first, and more
money will come afterward, and thus protec
tion is the safest and sure-*; mean 5 of securing
prosperity to the Americairpeaple. A protec
tive tariff i* a Nations'. necessity.
We cannot afford to trade off protection even
for bimetallism.
It goes without saying that the real strength
of the Bryan Democracy is in the Solid South.
The reasoa why the Solid Sooth is for free
trade and free silver is evident. The cottoa
proJucing portions of the South : are for free
silver and tree trade and wildly for Bryan,.be
cause they supply the world with cotton and
their chief market is England. They are
paid in gold.
They want cheap silver money at home to
they can pay their labor with aSO-cect dollar
and thus make a profit off the labor that pro
duces the crop; and they want free trade be
cause as they buy the most of the articles they
consume they wish to buy from caeap-labor
countries and thus punish "the manufacturers
of the North in their country.
In a word, they will sell what they produce ;
i for gold, pay their labor in silver, ruin the
American mechanic by building up foreign in- '
dustries and destroying our own and by, pat
ronizing foreign cheap labor and introduce
into American politics the results of a peonage !
worse than the old-time slavery. The South- '
crn Democracy never was friendly to Ameri
can labor.
No man can truthfully deny that we had ;
good times under protection without free sil- '
ver and we will have good times again if we !
have protection. We want our wool and our '
fruits and our raisins and all the product* of
MI farms well protected against foreign Com- j
petition and then California will be a pros
perous state. Take prunes; it costs the Cali
fornia producer a cent a .pound -to transport
them to a New York market, while it costs the i
French predecer but Â» quarter of a cent a; i
pound to transport his prunes to the same :
market. The French laborer gets from 30 to i
35 cents a day- for his labor; the American
laborer gets $1 a day. By reason of American '
competition the price of prunes in the New, j
York market has been lowered 100 per cent
in ten years. Without protection w e cannot
compete with France. It was a mistake to cut '
down the tariff on prunes or on Â«ny other !
product of the farm. Protection is the founda- ;
tion upon which all American prosperity
rests, because American labor must be savored
by American law or it wiir be of tbe same
value a? toreign labor arid our people cannot
I live on foreign prices for American labor. -
; . , la . this connection it is a matt , instructive '
; fact that there is sosllvermoat-mesallic coun
try where labor Is well paid. Look at Mexico,
Coloiabia and other silver States on this con
tinent, and then look at China, Japan, India
and Russia, which are silver countries- The I
price of : labor in every one of these countries '
is from 100 to 500 per cent below that in the '
United States. There is no enterprise, no re
wards for labor. The/ never see . gold.: Tney
have no conception of bimetallism. But Mr.
Bryan tells us that American ingenuity is a ;
protection I against the I competition of cheap :
labor." We tried this with the Chinese, but our â 
ingenuity was no match for -their -cheap
brawn aad muscle, and â  . we prohibited their '
coming, just as we vi.l have to prohibit :
foreign c&eap money from coming ; here. * The ;
United States is in no ser.se a chea > country. â 
This i* a new and an expensive civhlxition. -
-- So long as England dictates our tariff aws !
the will easily control ocr financial policy and
dictate .the prices ; charged - for w hat we buy I
abroad and what, we sell abroad. Sue con- :
trols the . money : of the : world, but she ,
cannot control the resources i f the worid. and !
so there is an irrepressiole conflict between the '
two great English-awaking peoplesâ Er gland j
and America. '. Both countries are seeking in- [
dustrial supremacy. "England imports nearly
all her breadstuff*, all her cotton, most of Her
fruit and meats and wool, and all of her. sugar,
wines, brandies," teas and coffee. : And England
must pay tor them Id eitier money ; or tilings.'
If we have a protective tariff ess of her things
and more of her money will come here. She
tries Â»o control the I prices of these : articles.
She does this in two ways:
i First â By dicutin,' the revenue laws of the
country she bu of, and ''â ^*38Sb8B&Â®&IBUÂ£
~i Secondâ By controlling â  the , monetary sys- ,
terns of the world. '' r " _, â¢

a seller of products. . And so a protective tariff ;

A loan was then required. Revolution and
secession followed. Toe free coinage of silver
was not an issue. ' We then enjoyed the fall

visitors with great spirit and cheering the

â  There were fu11y. 350 people on the plat

i well as of prominent citizens of Los An

1 to-night in the 'history of the county, and
the belief is quite common .that Los An
geles is likely to remain the banner
; county of the State in its ability to roll up
pleasing Republican majorities. Every

good will of thousands of Los Angeles

The day's programme in Los Angeles
began ear! y. Members of the McKinley
Club, anxious to cemect the union be

to receive their guests.
It should be borne in mind that there
was no attempt to get up a noisy street

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 29 â Long
before 7 o'clock the streets leading to the
pavilion were crowded, and by 7 there was
a grand rush for seats, but there-were- not
enough to accommodate naif ox the great
multitude that surged in front of the doors
and fought for places, reminding one of
the stormy scenes at the recent National
conventions. â  - *
Promptly at 8 o'clock the Grand Army
corps entered with fife and arum amid
great enthusiasm, 150 of the Soldiers' ana
Sailors' League marching in at the same
time.
The playing of the San Francisco band
at the entrance of the pavilion preceding
the opening of the meeting was loudly
cheered by the audience. At 8:10 o'clock
It was found that there were so many
people fighting to get into the pavilion
that there would be no accommodations
for them. There was a request for speaK

there was none to spare the matter was
postponed.

After the chairman's introductory re

the first speaker ot the evening, his re
marks being preceded by a song by the
Amphion Giee Club, a humorous political
melody that elicited prolonged applause,
as it contained many clever hits at Cleve
land and free silver. Mr. Shortridge arose
amid great applause, and said:
"It will be only a little while, if I may
judge by this demonstration to-night,
until Los Angeles rolls up one of the big

young men â and I was about to say old
women and young women, but women

the Republican banner is lifted high."
The sneaker said be brought good cbeer
from the north, where those marching
under the banner of Lincoln, Grant and
Blame were proud now to march under
the banner of McKinley. Continuing, he
said:
"You who work ought to consider your
own best interests, and you who are idle
ought to see to it that you have work.
The way to get it is Jo vote for protection
and prosperity. The record of the Repub
lican party is one great blaze of glory. It
fills the pages of history, and is full of the
deeds of good men. We younger men
thank you older Republicans that we do
not have to apologize for anything you
ever did. You old pioneers put the crown
of freedom on the slave and stood for the
dignity of American labor. While we ad
mire England, Ireland, Germany and
France, while we look to them with no
jealous eye, we recognize the fact that
this country is our home. The great Re
publican party is for American welfare,
for American liberty, for American homes.
Are you, men of Los Angeles, anxious for
fonr years more of Democracy? [Cries of
"No, noJ"J
"if you want it, you will have four years
more of deficit, of free trade and of dying
business. [Great applause.] If you want
four yesrs'of great prosperityyou will vote
for McKinley. It is then that you wi'l
hear once more the music of prosperity â
the song of anvil and forge."
Mr. Snortridge urged a vote for the Re
publican candidate for Congressman,
urged a Republican Legislature and a Re
publican Senator. Such a course, be said,
was the only one that would bring pros
perity. He said that there were now men
traveling over the country trying to raise
sectional issues, but he urged that such a
course wr.s opposed to the doctrines of the
Declaration and ought not to be encour
aged beneath the dag. Continuing, the
speaker said:
"Bryan is afraid to tell you why be is
still a rank free trader, but McKinley â "
[Here the mention of McKinley's name
resulted in prolonged cheering.J
"McKinley is not afraid of any question,
but meets them all bravely, whether it be
issues on money or tariff."
Tue m> ntion of Bryan's name by way of
illustration, resulted in cheering by a noisy
few who sought to disturb the meeting,
but the noise was soon drowned by cheers
for McKinley.
In conslusion, the speaker entered into
an elaborate analysis of the money ques
tion, showing that Republican statesmen
comprehended the money question and
tbat they would finally solve it to the best
interests of the entire people. Amid ap
plause, he said:
"The cause of hard times is not the
scarcity of money, but the trouble this
moment is the groundless fear that Bryan
will be elected President of the United
States. [Great cheering.]
"You all love the flag and the consti
tution, as I do; then wnat do you think of
a party that will denounce a President for
upholding the constitution?"
This question resulted in prolonged ap
plause, and shortly thereafter the speaker
cio?ed, amid great entnu lasm, the waving
of flags and beating of drums.
Beiore Mr. Shortridge had gone far the
clamor for speakers at the overflow meet
ing became so great that tney had to be
supplied, and hundreds outside the pa
vilion were addressed by local speakers,
among them Judge Carpenter, W. T. Wil
liams and W. S. Barnes. The crowd was
so large that it was impossible for any one
to enter the pavilion after 8 o'clock.
The next speaker was ex-Mayor W. K.
Davis of Oakland, who said: "The Demo
cratic party is insecure and it is to-day
permeated* with sectionalism. This party
has lor many years nominated its candi
dates for President from New York, buow
ing its sectionalism.
"Tney now come out West because they
were repudiated in 1894, showing again
that they are sectional. Their campaigns
are run on the basis of common ward
politics, combining with the Populists
and showing that they cannot erasp the
situation. In this campaign they have at
tacked property rights and assailed the
highest tribunal of the United States.
This is not the kind of a campaign that
appeals to the tQou.2b.tful patriots of the
land, and no party can win by assailing
the learned and unassailable integrity of
the United States Supreme Court."
The speaker dwelt on the fact that
Bryan failed at the law. "He was a
groundling in the law, an experiment in
Congress and then for eighteen months
an editor. Is such a man, admitted to the
bar but a few years ago, and who has been
a failure, fit to handle the ship of state?"
[Cries of "No" and great cheering.]
The speaker dwelt for some minutes on
the financial question and showed that
the free coinage of silver at 16 to 1 would
not benefit the man who has no bullion:
that the Government had no power to
make a silver dollar good one inch beyond
its territory. He showed the evils of
wildcat money and proved that Bryan's
ideas on money were as wild as those be
put forth on the tariff. He showed at
some length that the cause of falling
prices in this country must be looked for
in something besides the cry of free silver.
He inclined to the belief that cheap prod
ucts from afar, an overproduction of prod
ucts, were to be sought as the true cause
of hard times.
In conclusion he showed that the great
est thinkers of the Democratic party were
to-day for McKinley and sound money.
For these reasons the speaker urged the
audience to regard the Republican cam
paign this year as acampaign for National
honor, conducted by patriots irrespective
of party affiliations. He believed the peo
ple would respond to the sentiment at the
polls.
The chairman said tbat he regretted that
George A. Knight and General W. H. L.
Barnes were unavoidably detained away
irom the meeting. District Attorney W. 8.
Barnes, following, said:
"Ladies and gentlemen: If you will give
me half a chance, you can hear me. I
had intended to speak of silver from the
year 1 until now, but it is too late, and I
do not want to keep you up until Sunday.
But lam a Republican by choice and by
descent. lam proud that my party has
preserved liberty under the constitution,
the liberty of Washington and his
brothers. I have discovered that the Re
publican party is now carrying out a
scriptural injunction found in the seventh
chapter of Kings, where it says that
'Silver was as common as the stones, be
ini? abundant in Jerusalem.' [Laughter.]
"It is your duty to vote for McKinley,
thereby "saving the country as the grav
haireu members of the Grand Army saved
it before."
At this point some one yelled "Bryan,"
whereupon the speaker said: "Let my
friend wait a while, and he can weep over
Bryan's political grave. The man who
interrupts a public speaker is gen erally a
blackguard. [Great cheering.]
Jud c R. B. Carpenter was the last
speaker, and he made a characteristic ad
dress. He affirmed the principles of Re
publicanism, and predicted the success of
McKinley, saying that no man ever drew
his money out of a bank for fear that a
Republican would be elected President,
and no R -publican ever interrupted a
Democratic meeting.
The meeting adjourned with great
shouting after the Judge's parting sally:
"The Cbicago convention was dominated
by anarchists, and a few of the noisy con
tingent came here to interrupt this meet
ing. This snows the stuff the Bryan
cohorts are made of."

PASADENA, Cal., Aug. 29.â The star
political event in the history of Pasadena,
city of roses and snow, was that of to-day,
when 1200 or more citizens welcomed the
opening of the Republican campaign,
which bega? with the arrival of the spe
cial train bearing the Oakland Alliance.
The train arrived at 12:30 o'clock, and
the alliance at once gave a fancy drill that
greatly pleased the people. A short
march was made through the business
section of town to the inspiring strains of
the Artillery Band of Oakland. The mili
tary evolutions of the boys in line won
vociferous applause. Lunch was partaken
of at the Hotel Green, after which the
line of march was tuken to the Wigwam, a
spacious structure recently erected by Re
publicans for campaign purposes.
Here the following committee receivod
the Alliance : W. E. Arthur, George T.
Downey, Edwin Steams, Ed Lockett (who
afterward presided), John McDonald, J.

The following of the reception commit
tee were from Riverside: FranK A. Miller,
Hon. H. M. Streeter, J. T. Baumgartner,
George Frosi, M. J. Daniels and George O.
Chiliree.
These were from San Bernardino: Ed
Whitmore, editor oJ the Times, and Secre
tary Fleming of the Republican Central
Committee.
The following telegram from Major Mc-
Kinley to the Alliance was received at the
meeting:
Canton, August 29.
George P. Morrow, President Oakland Republi
can Alliance: I urn in receipt ot your telegram.
Your organization has splendidly manifested
its enthusiastic devotion to the Republican
doctrines of financial integrity, protection
and patriotism, which in the past has brought
unexampled prosperity and honor to the Na
tion. I congratulate the Republicans of Cali
fornia on the auspicious opening of the cam
paign. William McKinley.
The Alliance felt proud of th* telegram,
and the spirit of appreciation burst forth
in applause at frequent intervals.
At the Wigwam ihe first orator was Hon.
Samuel M. Shortridge, who was followed
by District Attorney W. S. Barnes of San
Francisco, Ex-mayor W. R. Davis of Oak
land and Colonel Harrison Grey Otis. Mr.
Shortridge made a brief address, full of
incisive points. He devoted himself
largely to the record of the two parties
that have fora generation played the im
portant part in American politics, show
ing that the Republican party's record
had always been synonymous with pros
perity, an honorable name abroad and the
general welfare of the masses.
"It is a party of hiuh purpose," he said,
"and one luing in its favor is that it has
always kept its promises, and its promises
have been pledges to do something worth
doing. Under Republican rule the coun
try has been prosperous, the condition of
the people has been bettered and the coun
try has made substantial progress, but un
der the Democracy there has nearly al

ways been lack of confidence, followed by
mark d industrial depression."
Mr. Shortridge showed that the Repub
lican party had always been the friend of
silver, having coined a vaat quantity prior
to 1873, and a large amount since. He
held that free coinage, however, would
matte the country monometallic in princi
ple, end that this would be the very evil
of which Democrats complain.
District Attorney Barnes spoke very
briefly, saying that Coneress could not
possibly pass' a law that would mase
thirty bushels of wheat equal to sixty,
nor could it make a law making sixteen
ounces of silver equal to one of gold.
There would be no power to make foreign
nations accept such a standard. He grace
fully exploded the prime fallacies of the
liatists, devoted himself for a tinaeto the
general record of the party and withdrew
to be followed by ex-Mayor Davis of Oak
land, who made a strong speech for pro
tection and against free silver. He told
in a graphic way how the Democrats had
ruined the wool industry by the Wiison
bill, and particularly how that law had
hurt California.
"For thirty-six years," he said, "the
Democrats have selected their candidates
Irom the East, generally from New York,
and now for the first time they come West
and take Bryan, who is a lawyer of limited
experience who failed at his profession.
That man is not fit to eovern the Nation.
But they set him up against a man of the
superb ability of Major McKinlev. Bryan
is a demagogue and McKinley is a
splendid statesman. Which will you ac
cept for President?"
It was the general opinion thai no such
enthusiasm has ever been seen in this
part of tiie State as that which character
ized to-day's proceedings at Pasadena.
PROTECTION
THE ISSUE
I Continued from IHrit PaffÂ«.J
ot it. Commercial and financial success is the
highest achievement of this age. And so we
must have protection or we will have cheap
labor. Cheap labor is never intelligent labor,
and all Americans must be intelligent, or ;lus
Republic cannot stand. This is the price we
pay for libertyâ who can object to It?
During the last four years the depreciation
in annual crop values has been enormous.
This depreciation largely accrued when the
Democrats commenced tinkering with the
tariff. Take wool, for instance, the average
price was 17 cents a pound before it was put
on the free list by the Democracy; now It <s 8
and 9 cents a pound. Barley was 54 cents;
now it is 34 cents a bushel. Corn was in 1892
worth 38 cents a bushel; in 1895, 20 cents.
Wheat in 1892 was worth 75 cents a bushel,
and in 1895, 50 cents a bushel. The price of
every product of the farm was, and is, on the
down grade. The above are Eastern prices.
In livestock the depreciation is even greater,
until the annual depreciation of the products
of the American farms under Mr. Cleveland's
administration reached the enormous amount
of $1,462,551,473.
This does not include the 1038 on fruits, nuts
and raisins, w ' erein California Is more par
ticularly interested.
The unquestioned facts are that we had feir
prices under a protective tariff, with exactly
the same monetary and coinage laws which
we now have; but now, with a taritt' for
revenue and free trade we have low prices and
hard times.
The result of the present Democratic tariff
reform legislation, as compared with the re
sults under the Republican administration, is
instructive. For the year 1892 our exports
reached the enormous sum of $1,015,732,011.
It is admitted this was & productive year. But
note this: Our exports for the year 1895 were
only $824.862,475â 5h0wing a loss undt-r Dem
ocratic rule ior the years indicated of $190.
--869,536, while the difference in the amount of
our imports is no less marked.
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894,
under the old tariff laws, our imports were
only $647,775,017. while for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1895, under the tariff-reform
laws of the Democracy, our imports were In
creased to $801,663,490, or an increase of im
ports under Democratic rule of $153,888,473;
thus showing a loss of exports ot Amonenn
products to a foreign market in a single year
of $190,869,535, and at the same time au in
crease of imports of foreien-made goods to an
American market of $153,888,473. In a word,
by reason of the change of our tariff laws we
sold, in round numbers, $190,000,000 1-jss in
1895 than in 1892, and bought $153,000,000
more in 1895 than In 1894â making a clear
loss, in round numbers, of $340,000,000, or
an amount greater than is required aunually
to support most of the leading natiens of the
world. All this time we had $600,000,000 oi
silver coin and silver certificates ready for
use, but which was not used. We hhd more
silver money than could be or was used, be
cause we had no business at home.
For the twenty-eight years of Republican
rule we paid two billions of the National debt.
Duriug the lour years next preceding Mr.
Cleveland's first administration, namely,
covering the administration of Garfleld and
Arthur, we paid $497,429,250 on the National
debt. During the next lour years, covering
Mr. Cleveland's first administration, we paid
but $276,041,350â a little more than half as
much. During the administration of Presi
dent Harrisonâ from March 1 , 1889, to March,
1893, and notwithstanding the Cleveland
tariff tinkering of the pievious yearâ the Re
publicans paid on the principal of the National
debt $236,000,000; while during the very
next three years, under Mr. Cleveland's ad
ministration, directly following Harrison'sâ
from 1892 tiil now â we have actually run iv
debt $202,000,000. And for all these periods,
let me add, the laws-governing the coinage of
silver were exactly the same as now. The
tariff duties were changed, but the coinage of
money was not, and so this condition cannot
be attributed to the money question.
Possibly the best illustration of the effect of
Democratic tariff legislation on the industries
of the country is found in the fact that during
the four years of Garfield and Arthur's admin
istration, our foreign trade was $512,362,773
more than during the four succeeding years
covering Mr. Cleveland's first administration.
Bo during the last two years of Mr. Harrison's
administration, our total foreign trade was
$325,872,802 more than it was during the first
two years of Cleveland's administration fol
lowing. So our foreign trade during the first
three years of the present Cleveland adminis
tration shows, iD exports, $225,243,711 less
than during the last three yeais of Harrison's
administration.
These illustrations demonstrate the differ
ence between a Republican and Democratic
administration, and between & protective and
a f r.;e trade or tariff reform policy.
These illustrations show that protection fs
our ouly remedy for hard times, and so we will
not barter protection away for anything else.
We don't believe anything else can take its
place.
I believe in bimetallism, and I do not now
know of anything I have ever said in favor of
bimetallism that I would not repeat to-day
with added emphasis, and yet, if it were neces
sary to do so, I am not prepared to surrender
the principles of protectiou for bimetallism.
The Republican party is for bimetallism in its
best and strongest sense.
The unquestioned facts of history are that
when the Democratic pirty was 40 years old
secession became the logical result of its prin
ciples; that when the Republican party was
five years old the logical and inevitable result
of its principles made It stand the matchless,
heroic and patriotic defender of the American
Nation, and it has been the great National
American party ever since.
It has been American in the higher sense
that its principles are as broad as tue conti
nent and as fur reaching as are the wants of
man. it has Blood for civil and religious lib
erty, because without both neither could sur
vive. It has stood for the American Union,
because without a union of the States the
whole Nation would fall, for a nation divided
against itself cannot stand. It has stood for
republican principles of government, because
if this national experiment of free government
should fail republics will be wiped fr. m the
face of the earth and the hopes oi the lovers of
freedom will be lost forever. It has stood for
an Amur can protective tariff, because this is
necessary to secure prosperity to the American
people. It has opposed all that whs un-Ameri
can in our civil polity, because this Republic
stands among the nations of the earth the soli
tary defender oi the equal rights of man.
The preat overshadowing principle of onr
party since the rebellion is protection, but we
believe in and have always maintained a Na
tional financial system that will protect all
meu and injure none. We believe iv building
and maintaining an American navy, and in
erecting forts for the National defense. We
are opposed to lowering the American flag,
whether it be raised on the Sandwich Island*
or on the Island of Cuba, or anywhere else â on
land or sea. We have always defended the
labor of the poor, and with equal justice have
protected the money of the rich. We believe
in thcMonroe Doctrine as the settled law gov
erning the Nations of the Western Continent,
timl we will risk every man and every dollar
In its defense. We would maintain the Na
tional credit by earning money, upt by bor
rowing it. These, among other tenets, have
been the Deacon lights of our party ior all the
years of Its existence, and we appeal to the
truth of history to sustain our position â we
are for freedom without anarchy; for liberty
regulated by law.
The Repuclican party shrinks from no re
sponsibilities. They face every danger and
boldly meet every issue. The un-American
course pursued by our political opponents is
made conspicuously apparent by the recent
action of the American Protective AssoclÂ«tion
in opposing Governor McKinley for the Presi
dency. The reasons given to the public for
the opposition of this association to him were
that when Governor of Ohio he appointed to
office American citizens without regard to or
beinu controlled by ibeir religious convictions.
Was not that right? Don't you want just such
a man for President ?
If reasons like these enn influence the elec
tion of a President of the United States, then
the early settlement of this country by the
lovers of religious liberty, the Declaration of
Independence, the Revolutionary War and the
creation of this great Nation were vain and
useless acts.
Tbe selection of a President of the United
States should not be made by chance. Few
men possess requisite qualifications for that
great office. The President of 70,000,000 of
free people should be both a wise and nn
honeat man. Our peculiar domestic affairs.
our strained relations with foreign powers, our
complicated financial and revenue systems,
the uecessity of maintaining law and order at
home, and thereby securing the rights of life
and property, the numerous and important
appointments to office, the wide range of busi
ne*s knowledge required, the deliberation and
self-poise which age and experience bring,
added to the highest intelligence, all com
bined, are necessary to equip a man to be the
fit ruler of the greaten Republic of the ages.
No mere boy orator, however attractive his
figures of speech, loud his voice or graceful
his gesture i, is thereby qualified for the sober
duties of a wise ruler of a great and enlight
ened Nation. Deeds, not words, are the neces
sary requisites of the United States.
Governor McKinley is a man of the people,
and he came from the people. When a mere
boy he enlisted as a private soldier in the
army of the Union. After the war he followed
with patient industry the pursuits of peace.
He was many times elected to Congress, was
leader of the House of Representatives, and
was there schooled in all the arts of American
statecraft. He whs made Governor of the
Stale of Ohio, and is nÂ«iW of mature years, in
the fullness oi his mental and physical man
hood.
(&He.needs no platform as a guide to the im
portant duties of Presiili-iit. ilis principles are
broad ami National. They form a platform in
themselves to which the American people enn
safely and confidently lend their support. He
is a believer in the broadest civil and religions
liberty, and would risk every hope ol prefer
ment or reward of ambition to maintain both
these great American principles. In tbe
broadest sense he is an American. His knowl
edge of afiairs,*tne strength and courage of his
convictions, his love of liberty and the sacri
fices that he has mnde in the past and would
make in the future to maintain all these,
added to the purity of his nrivate life, point
him out as the best equipped American to fill
the great office to which he aspires.
Republicnns, 1 adjure you to stand solid in
this great contest. Line up and face to the
front. Let no factions control or misdirect
your action. Remember, it is your country,
more than your party, that now calls to duty.
Our National honor is at stake, our National
credit is swinging in the balance, our National
peace is imperiled, our prosperity is endan
gered. United we will succeed, divided we
will fail.

an Auspicious Dedica
tion.
Pioneer Hall was swathed in the colors
that move the pulses of patriotism, and
the portraits of many patriots looked
down from the walls on a throng gathered
last night to vouch for the perpetuity of
their cause.
The red, white and blue twined and in
tertwined aDout the walls and chandffliers,
pinned up with shield*, while from the
ceiling in front of the platform drooped a
festoon of tri-colored ribbons. From down
in front of the door the stirring music of
the band rose to the gathering audience,
while the sky was lit by frequent flashes of
vari-colored lights. It was a great gather
ing of enthusiastic Republicans, a great
part of which were women. Among these
was a niece of Major McKinley â Miss Ida
McKinley Morse.
The following vice-presidents and mem
bers of the executive committee were
seated in and about the stage:
Tlrey L. Ford, president; Eugene F. Bert,

At 8 o'clock the band marched up the
stairs, took a position reserved for them
at the right ot the hall, and alter discours
ing for a few minutes the secretary of the
National Republican League, under the
auspices of which the meeting was held,
introduced Irving M. Scott as the first
speaker.
"It is the purpose of this league and of
this meeting," said Mr. Scott, "to begin
the worK of educating the people upon
the great issues at stake in this campaign.
Probab;y never before, or at least not for
very many years, have there been issues
of such moment to be settled by the vot
ers of the country as are now before the
people. I began the work of education
more than six months ago by a published
article going to show that the era of high
tariffs protecting the industries of the
country have been in all the history of the
Government the periods of prosperity."
The speaker undertook to illustrate the
different methods of taxation and the
raising of revenues. In referring to the
Wiison or income tax* bill, he said he was
in favor of taxing incomes, and be did not
believe that there was a man in the
country really opposed to the taxing of
incomes. That law had been declared un
constitutional, and why ? Because it was
shown that it was a tax on classes â that
nearly all the Southern States, ii had been
shown, were wholly exempt from taxation
under it. The Supreme Court had de
cided it was unconstitutional, and yet the
Democratic party had in its platform de
clared it was in favor of securing a reversal
of that judgment. Any party that was
pledged to stuff that highest tribunal of
the people so that it should make a parti
san decision, was unworthy of the confi
dence of the people or of being trusted
with the direction of the destiny of the
Nation. [Applause.l
He now turned to the discussion of the
financial question. What was this 16 to 1
idea that was absorbing the thoujjhisof
the Nation now? He had heard a work
man explain that it meant 16 days of idle
â¢ness for the laboring man to 1 as now.
Another had explained that it meant 16
emigrants to las now. If it was under
stood for what it realiy is, he said, it would
be tabooed forevermore. tie, he said, was
a bimetailistof the bimetalliets.and so was
his partyâ to bring it into operation just
as soon as it can be brought without dis
aster.
There is $624,000,000 of good coin in the
United States and $1,200,000,000 of fiat
money, all good for its lace because re
deemable in goldâ a gold dollar back of
every other dollar. With the free coinage
of silver the attempt to Keep the silver
dollar, made ad libitum, on a parity with
gold the men who come first and sought
redemption in gold would get itâ get it to
the extent of those $<300,000,n00. After
that tli* re would be nothing to re-teem
with and the silver dollar would be. worth
just its bullion value and no more. That
was quite dear to any man's understand
ing.
JUurinsr the war the price of goJd went
up to $2 85â that is. it took $2 85 in the
paper currency to buy a doLar of gold.
The Bilverite says the price of gold
goes up. It is not true. Gold is the one
tiling that is stationary in its value. It is
the other mediums of exchange or com
modities that fall. The * aCi is ea . si| y
proveji by placing a bar of gold against
any other money or commodity. Gold re
mains fixedâ it is the quantity or quality
of the others that fluctuate.
Just here the loud blowing of the fire
alarm whistle drowned the speaker's voice.
He hesitated a moment and then cried,
between the shrieks of the alarm, "That
is Bryan blowing his horn." which turned
the laugh on the whistle. By way of
illustrating his point, the speaker said
that in 1877 the Union Iron Works had
sold an en.me for $1200 the exact counter
part of which they sell now at $400, yet
the difference in the wages paid was
scarcely material. The reason is that the
money paid for it is good â a gold dollar
bacK ol every silver dollar to guarantee its
value and every promise oi the Govern
ment.
Looking over the ground in 1873 the
men at the head of our Government saw
the trend of the nations with regard to
money; saw that Germany, Switzerland,
nearly all the countries of Europe, were de
monetizing the silver dollar, and they in
their turn dropped that dollar from our
currency. There had been a good many
babies born since then, babies that had
since become voters, and he would ask
t em if there had not been a long period
of prosperity, interrupted only by these
four years last past.
Silver therefore could not be held re
sponsible for the trouble. The reason was
to be found in a blunder committed within
these four years. This country had been
buying more than it sold. Any man who
did that â bought more than his income
could pay for â would soon De in deep
financial trouble.
The industries, and especially the man
ufactories, of the country had been
checked and interrupted by t' c cut in the
tariff that permitted the importation of
goods manufactured in other countries by
underpaid workmen. That was the cause
of the trouble, and no men knew it better
than those who live in the midst of manu
facturing communities, as does William
McKinley of Ohio. [Applause.]
Under the Sherman act the Government
purchased 4,500,000 ounces of silver a
month, or 54,000,000 a year. Under the
free-coinage ratio that would amount to
$32,000,000. Who would pay that money
if not the workingmen?
It would be they that would have to
assume the tax created by the absurd law,
putting a double value on the metal. The
owners of silver mines may grow rich, but
the roan who works in the mines and
every other workman who receives wages
would grow proportionately poorer be
cause of the depreciation in the value of
the coin which they received for their
labor. â¢
"For instance, he said, suppose the Gov
ernment made a law declaring that a
double price must be paid lor all the
product of the Union Iron Works. Think
of $8,000,000 for an Oregon, instead of
$4,000,000. Would not we increase the
plant until it spread all over the Potrero?
Would that be any reason for an increase
in the pay of the men? No. I would say
to them, I am willing to pay you a lair
price for your labor; this is an act of the
Government especially for my own benefit.
And yet there is more^reason for a law
of that kind than for doubling the price
of silver, for we have all the Bilver we
want, and we have not as many warships
as we need to whip the world, as we should
have.
"Our money now is good anywhere in
the world, because it is redeemable in
fold. It should remain so. Back of it all
is the honor and integrity of the country
that must be maintained. Would you,
having loaned money, honor a man who
attempted to repay you in depreciated
coinâ money worth half that that you
loaned? I do not believe there is any
calamity coming. I believe in tbe.intelli
gence of the people. Confidence will be
restored and with it better times will
come. It takes time to restore confidence.
You can harm a bank in a single day by a
run on it, such as it will take months to
overcome. We are face to face with the
proposition, and the peopie will rally to
the standard of the old party that pre
served the Union and the integrity of the
Union through its sorest trial."
The speaker described the difference be
tween tv is and other countries with regard
to the condition of the working men. He
said he had Taeen in every part of the
globe. He had visited the vineyards of
Europe and seen how the vineyard st went
about his place, on speaking acquaintance
with grapes on the vines, with a knowl
edge of every leaf. Bright boys and girls
labored among the vines without knowing
really the taste of the grapes or without
ever tasting tbe wine. It was all too ex
pensive for them. He had seen the
laborers cooking their breakfast of burned
bread, treasuring the bit of fire, and yet
they were comparatively contented and
nappy. He had returned to this land of
plenty to see the fruit scattered over many
acres unpicked, prodigal wastefulness
everywhere.
The people were better fed, better
housed and every way better provided for
than in any other country, but they were
restless and discontentedâ they want still
better conditions. They demand protec
tion against these others of other coun
tries â the protection of the home, of their
industry, and they will demand that they
be paid for their labor in honest money."
[Applause.]
Colonel Andrews, who sat in the front
row of chairs, passed a word to the
speaker as he sat down, and Mr. Scott in
terrupted the quartet about to begin a
jubilee to announce that "I have a con
vert. A gentleman here who says he has
voted consecutively for twelve Demo
cratic candidates for the Presidency will
this fall vote for William McKinley, pro
tection and prosperity."
This was greeted with a round of ap
plause.
The California Quartet rendered some
stirring Republican verses to the tune of
"Man Angeline," for which they were up
roariously encored, and to which they re
sponded with aome more selections of the
same song.
General Robert A. Friedrlch was the
second speaker, lie was introduced as a
friend and comrade of Major McKiniey.
He said :
"If we needed any ocular demonstration
of the effect of talking silver we have it
right here in this town. It has frightened
the people out of their wits. In safe-de
posit vaults mere are very lew if any boxes
to be had, and the rush for them has come
since the Chicago convention. People are
already hoarding their gold.
"In a savings bank recently I saw a
placard stating that the depositors of that
bank would receive their deposits in gold,
whether Bryan is elected or not. This
indicates that the people are getting un
easy and beginning to take into personal
possession their little stock of gold. The
object of this sign was to allay these fears.
This is the only State in the Union where
contracts are payable in fold.
"I do want to say," he continued, "I
acre? with Mr. Scott. The more I con
template the political situation I am im
pressed that the people of this country are
facing a crisis greater than that of 1860.
The people of this country are getting
tired of the trials and tribulations brought
upon them in the last thirty rive years by
the Democratic party. That party first
plunged ihe country into a war which
cost 500,000 young lives. But peace and
prosperty were restored by the Republican
party.
was the condition of the country
in 1893, when the Democrats again de
ceived the people and not into power arid
overthrew the McKinley bill. 1 think his
catanic majesty has done less harm than
Mr. Mills' and' Mr. Gorman's bill.
"The thing witn which i have the leaet
sympathy in this campaign is the appeal
to the passions instead of the reason of tbe
{eopie, and it begins with Mr, Bryan,
bey say it is the battle of the masses
against the classes. Who are the debtor
class ? It ia the wage-earners. They are
debtors of the corporations and the indi
viduals who employ them. They have the
right to be paid at the ena of each riay in
money of the highest purchasing power.
If the i'llo mills would start up you would
see their output purchase*! by this army
of meu who have, under Democratic rule,
been going on half rations, and many of
them on no rations at all.
"Bryan went to the Chicaeo conven
tion, "he sad, "witn a reputation as an
orator. This he obtained at co\inty fnirs
and Populist picnics. One other* thing
he had was a monumental amount of
nerve. John Sherman sai.l that after he
read Bryan's spe eh he did not longer
wonder why he was called 'the Boy Orator
of the Plane.' That river is one* of th>
most wonderful rivers in the world geo
graphically. It is abou' 2000 miles long
and six inches deep. [Laughter.] Bryan
indorses socialistic, anarchist c und pos>u
iistic doctrines. He i 3 not for anti-Chinese
legislation. Yet there are people who will
say that California is going for Bryan. In
the language of my friend Charlie Short
ridge, or as ha would put it, 'N-nit!'
"Wnetber he is elected or no 1 ," he said
in conclusion, "William McKiniey will
go down in history in honorable mention,
and his memory will be revered by gen
erations yet unborn for his services to his
country, when Mary Lease and Sockless
Simpson and others will be entirely for
gotten."
President Ford of the league arrived at
the hall at this time, and the Senator as
sumed the duties of chairman. He
brought the cheering news that hundreds
of people could not get admission to the
Auditorium meeting. The Dand played a
selection.
Judge H. C. Dibble was the next
speaker, lie made a brief speech.. Be
said:
"The American people are the only peo
ple on the face oÂ£ the globe who govern
themselves. That ia the reason they are
so interested in elections. That is the
significance of this gathering to-night, not
only of those who vote, but of those who
control the voters. Tbe American people
are now about to choose, on the one hand,
between a new radical party, and, on the
other hand, the grand old party whose
history is full oi honors and patriotismâ a
party that has borne aloft the flag on tbe
rieid of battle and that will place William
McKinley in the White House. [Cheers]
The Republican party is conservative, and
has welcomed and received into its ranks
the conservative Democrats and citizens
of the country. The party will conserve
and preserve that great wealth that never
came to a nation before.
"I predict that on election day the con
servative people of this country will re
pudiate the combination of Populism and
pseudo-Democracy and place William Mc-
Kinlejain the Presidential chair."
The National Republican League quar
tet sang "There's Moonlight on the
Lake." They were enthusiastically re
called and responded with a selection con
cerning McKinlev set to the tune, "She's
the Girl for Me."
Louis Titus, a young attorney and cham
pion of sound money, was introduced. He
said:
"The advocates of free coinage have
promised to make business lively. I tell
you they will make it lively for you. You
ail remember the history of the trad* dol
lar on which many persons were swindled
out of 15 to 20 cents. Why should we now
follow the lead of the silver mine owners?
The doctrine of cheap money has been re
pudiated by the leading silver men them
selves. After the silver is coined into dol
lars a market must be found for them.
And there is no law on earth to force a
merchant to take silver dollars accept at
his own price. The man who has com
modities to sell will not rush around to
find a man with cheap money to buy them.
People only want cheap money in order
to give it to somebody else at more than
its value. [Applause.]
"What caused the fall of silver? Ger
many put up all her silver at public auc
tion. It found its way into France and
Switzerland and all the countries of tne
Latin Union, and finally India, which had
been the largest consumer of silver, closed
its mints to the coinage of silver. Now, if
all these nations demonetized silver, will
it not take them all to remonetize it? It
we have a depreciated currency the labor
ing man will get a depreciated dollar.
This is a campaign of right against wrong.
Let tbe workingman receive his wages in
the best money that the world affords."
General W. H. L. Barnes, in answer to
numerous calls from tbe audience, then
addressed tbe meeting. He said:
"Tbe people of California are anxious to
learn what is true and to do what is right.
As an aid to these ends the Democratic
party has proved itself a complete failure.
Such candidates as they put up at Chicago
are cause enough why" Democrats should
feel deeply ashamed oi themselves.
"On the other hand the candidates pro
posed by the Republican party form a
phalanx of civic virtue and personal in
tegrity, which is one of tbe great glories,
if not the greatest glory of that party. Mr.
McKinley's record is a part of the Nation's
history. Pure, brave, patriotic, he is a
fitting man to till the chair of Lincoln.
Mr. Hobart, though not quite so. well
known as Major McKinley, has a well-da
served social and political prestige by rea
son of his learning and hit* sterling pa
triotism.
"But, as for Bryan, I contend that he is
not the man to sit in the Presidential
chair. He seems to pander to the worst
element in the country. His sneÂ«ca in
Chicago was nothing wonderful. His cross
of gold is falling to pieces with old age,
and his crown of thorns begins to look like
a last year's Christmas wreath. When we
come to Sewall and Watson, what can we
say? They are twins, born of the same
mother but of different fathers, and it i"
hard to tell which of them is farthest off
at sea. They seem to be busily engaged
in finding out 'where they are at.' Be
these thy candidates, Democracy?"
Introducing Miss Anna Shaw, Mr. Ford
dwelt upon the services rendered fry
woman to the Nation's welfare, and said
his organization had shown its confidence
in woman by sending Mrs. Addie L. Bal
lou as a delegate to the convention of
American National League of Republican
Clubs at Milwaukee.
"The Republicans of California," said
Miss Shaw, "have proved that they are
true to the cardinal principles of Republi
canism. California expects each of her
sons to do dis duty. If any class of men
refuses to go to the polls, these men will
be subjects of the Government and not
sharers in it. Now, Mr. Chairman and
gentlemen and ladies, what iÂ« sauce for
the goose is sauce for the gander. If men
have been cast down and brought to pov
erty by means of improper government,
have not women sÂ»ffered ah well? Gen
tlemen, the same evils which harass and
injure you affect women in like manner.
"You hope for the election of Major
McKinley to the Presidency of this No
tion. Let me beg you not to disregard the
prayer of your mothers and sisters to be
elected, not to office, not to posts consid
ered honorable by the masses of the people,
but. to full citizenship. Gentlemen of Cal
ifornia, I have known your courtesy and
chivalry. Show me on election day that
it is real."
A burst of applause greeted the close of
Miss Shaw's eloquent address, the band
voiced the inspiring tones of old "Amer
ica," an<l the vast assemblage dispersed
with three cheers for the Republican nom
inees.

BERLIN, Gebmattt, Aug. 29.â Although
the Czar has concluded his visit to Vienna
and taken his departure for Kief, where
he will stay until he is ready to go to Bres
lau, at which place he will arrive Septem
ber 5. Prince Lobanoff-Rostovsky, the
Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, who
accompanied the Czar from St. Petersburg
to Vienna, will remain in the Austrian
capital several days longer, and the an
nouncement of this fact is causine the
growth of a large crop of surmises tnat
negotiations of some kind are in progress
between the Russian Foreign Minister and
Goluchowski, the Austrian Minister of
Foreign Affairs. Prince Lobanoff's con
ference with Prince Hoheniohe, the im
perial Chancellor of Germany, has been
rixed to take place at Breslau on Tuesday
next, September 1, and at this meeting
Freiherr Marshall yon Bieberstein, Ger
man Minister of Foreign Affairs, will also
be present. Thus it will be seen that
whatever German diplomacy means to
effect in conned ion with the Czar's visit
to Germany, will be concluded before the
Kaiser receives the Czar at the Bresiau
station on the morning of September 5.
Every hour of the time from the arrival
of the Czar and Czarina at Breslau, till
the Russian and German noonarchs leave
that city will be filled with ceremo
nials, receptions, banquets, etc. Among
the high German officials whom the
Kaiser has ordered to be in attendance
upon the Russian Emperor and Empress
are General yon Lignitz, commander of
the Brandenburg army corps; General
yon Villaume, Colonel yon Moitke and
Baron Heitze. On the morning of Sep
tember 7 the Russian imperial party will
go to Goerlicz to review the Posen corps of
the German army, and on the evening of
that day they will start for Kiel, where
the German North Atlantic squadron has
been ordered to concentrate and receive
them. The programme of the Czar may
be altered, however, if the report be true
that the Czarina, under the advice of her
physicians, intends to abandon her tour
\rilh her husband and return to St. Pe
tersburg to await her impending accouche
ment, leaving the Czar to continue his
journey alone. If this report is confirmed
the Kaiseriu will not go to Breslau with
the Kaiser.
Though they have excited a ereat deal
of public discussion very little importance
is attached in official circles to the confer
ences which have taken place in .Vienna
between Count Goluchowski and Prince
Lobanoff. It is known that Count
Goluchowski has talked with Prince Loban
off of the possible consequences of the dis
turbances which have occurred in Con
stantinople and that the two Ministers
have agreed that nothing ought to be done
by any of the powers which would disturb
the serenity oi the concert of the powers
which the Czar desired to have prolonged
throughout his European tour. In diplo
matic circles there is a great deal of com
ment upon the cold ana perfunctory
terms of the toasts which were given at
the court dinner in honor of the Czar at
the Hof burg Palace in Vienna, as well as
at the luncheon which was given at the
Hofburg prior to the departure of the
Russian imperial party to-day.
The semi-official press of Vienna ex
plain the toasts given at the court dinner
by saying that they were necessarily color
less, in view of the fact that the Austrian
Emperor is a member of the Dreibund,
while the Czar is an ally of France. Re
ferring to the old comradeship-in-arms of
Austria and Russia against France would
have been extremely awkward for the
Czar upon the eve of his visit to Paris,
hence Emperor Francis Joseph only al
luded to the Czar's visit to \ ienna as a
pledge of the friendship existing between
Austria and Russia.
The Fremdenblatt of Vienna, in an arti
cle in its issue cf to-day, indicates as a
general result of the Austrian and Russian
Ministers' exchange of views that it is the
aim of Austria, Germany and Russia to
'â  intinue to prevent a European confla
gration. Precisely as Russia had no de
sire to intervene in Armenia, so nothing
will be done now in the way of -interfer
ence in Constantinople, the Europeans
there being sufficiently protected by the
warships of their respective countries.
According to the Berlin Tageblatt the
Czar has expressed a wish to have an in
terview with Prince Bismarck, and it is
possible that his Majesty may arrange to
visit Friedrichsruhe on his way to Kiel.
Bolore going to Copenhrgen the Czar will
srend two days at the Schloss of Prince
ilnnry of Prussia at Hemmelsmark, in
>ciiieswig-Holstein, where he will meet
t he Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse, the
urana Duke Sergius of Russia, Princess
Louise of Batten berg and a number of
others.
The German Catholic Congress, which

act fire to the main building of the lowa,

upon the State of $150,000. The inmates
were removed in safety, and the other

SWEEP OF THE FOREST FIRES.
Michigan Militia Ordered to One Stricken
Town to Check the Law/ess
Element.
HOUGHTON, Mich., Aug. 29.â Two
local companies of the Fifth Regiment,
State militia, were notified last night by
the Governor to go to Ontonagon on call
of the Sheriff there. The lawless element
was reported to be in control of the
burned town. Threats were made, it was
said, against the lives of the foremen of
the Diamond Match Company.
Incendiary fires, the Governor was in
formed, were destroying the remaining
buildings. An appeal was made for prompt
action for the safety of the suffering resi
dents of the stricken villane, and the Gov
ernor issued the order accordingly.
ASHLAND, Wis., Aue. 29.â The annual
forest fires broke out in this vicinity yes
terday, and the mill and yards of the Be
noit Lumber Company, located at Benoit,
a small station on the Chicago, St. Paul,
Minneapolis and Omaha Railroad, twenty
miles from here, are swept away.
A special train was sent from here last
night witti|a crew of men to make an ef
fort to save the village.
At Moquah, twenty miles west on the
Northern Pacific, every building at that
place was burned. A freight train on the
Northern Pacific had to abandon its tracks
yesterday afternoon from Ashland Junc
tion and came in over the Omaha.
At 11 o'clock to-day heavy rains set in,
which hÂ«lped to check the forest tires.
The special train to Benoit has re
turned. The mill of the Benoit Lumber
Company was saved by hard work, but
5,000,000 feet of lumber "belonging to the
Benoit Lumber Company, Charles Crog
sten and others were destroyed. Quite a
number of homesteaders were burned out
in the Moquah district on the Northern
Pacific, but the losses will be light. It is
believed that no lives were lost.
PITHIANS BREAKING CAMP.
The Supreme Lodge Completes Its An-
nual Sension at Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 29.â The Sn
preme Lodge of the Knights of Pythias
this morning, by the committee appointed
to consider the preparation of charges
against certain chancellors, recommended
that the full text of the report made by
the past supreme chancellor be adopted.
The report provides that all charges of
disloyalty to the order made against Past
Grand Chancellor C. F. Laehr of Virginia
be dismissed.
The Supreme Lodge also pats a quietus
forever on the much-discussed question of
reviving tbe German ritual.
The matter came up for a final vote this
evening, and the resolutions to print the
ritual in German for lodges that wanted it
in that language was defeated by a vote of
102 to 13.
The committee to which was referred the
naming of the time and place for the next
biennial convention failed to report, but
will do so early next week.
Three cities are in the race â Indianap
olis, Omaha and San Francisco, with the
chances in favor of the former city.
Camp Perry Payne is a thing of the
past to-night, all of tbe Knights save the

Major.

THE LEAD.
Their Devotion to the Country
Shown in the Past and
Present.
CCMMERCIAL TRAVELERS ALSO
PAY THEIR RESPECTS.
Visitors Liberally Applaui the Can
didate's Views on Protection
and Reciprocity.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 29.â Two State
delegations which were expected to-day
postponed their visits at the last moment,
and instead of four Major McKinley made
two speeches to-^.ay. The second one was
to 1000 representative German-American
Voters from Cleveland, who arrived on a
Special train at 4 o'clock and marched to
the McKinley residence with their own
bands and glee clubs. Each man in the
delegation carried a small American flag,
Bnd several large ones were borne in the
procession at different points. There were
Jully 2000 people clustered in densely
pacaed groups abont Major McKinley's
home awaiting the arrival of the German-
American delegation. Most of the Chicago
Commercial Club was there.
When Major McKinley appeared the
1000 Cleveland men waved their flags. The
first speaker. Captain E. H. Bohm, was in
troduced by Colonel Louis Smithnight.
The next spokesman for the German-
Americans was ex- Representative Snyder.
He made a stirring address, declaring that
the German- Americans would stand by
iMcKinley as a stone wall for sound money
and protection. On election day, the
speaker declared, they will speak for pros
perity, for honesty and National honor.
'When Major McKinley mounted the chair
to speak the cheering was tumultous. He
eaid:
My fellow-citizens : It i s with peculiar pleas
tire and satisfaction that I welcome this repre
sentative body of German-American citizens of
Cleveland and of Northern Ohio to the city of
Canton and my own home. I appreciate most
heartily your call, which as a compliment to
myself I prize very highly, but more than all
and above all I value it as a significant ex
pression of your interest and zeal in the great
political campaign upon which we have en
tered. [Applause.] The citizens of the United
States have learned not only to respect, but to
depend upon the Germans as a great and po
tent influence in our civilizationâ safe and
steady in every emergency, and patriotic in
every crisis. [Great applause-] Loving your
mother country as you do so affectionately
does not mean that you love your adopted
country less, bat that you have hearts big
enough for the love of both. [Applause and
cries of "Good, pood."] Transplanted in the
free soil of America, German characteristics
, have strengthened our institutions and exer
cised both a salutary and wise influence in our
progress as a Nation. -
Love of Fatherland, that deep and noble
sentiment which has ever distinguished you,
means to our German citizens always love of
America and her free institutions and abso
lute and unqualified devotion to every true
American interest. [Great applause.] Respect
or law and order and faithtul obedience to
;constltuted authorities have been distinguish
."ing traits of the Germans on both sides ef the
Atlantic, while hatred of wrong and oppres
sion has called him to arms as quickly from
fail farm on our Western prairies as â  from his
Ancestral vineyard on the Rhine. Historians
. have recorded in all its greatness the strength
and service of that German army which rallied
to the standard of liberty and union at the
call of Lincoln and enrolled in its splendid
<Aistory the imperishable names of thousands
who so nobly suffered and died for their im
periled country. [Great cheering.] But no
such sacrifice, honorable as it li, can do
injustice to the services of those brave men, nor
- can it estimate at its true value their firm sup
port of the Union in its moral effect upon all
cur people. [Applause.] Proudly can the
German-American soldiers point to their
deeds of valor and suffering In that great war.
Confidently can they claim that they brought
no shame upon the German name and bore
â  themselves upon the battle-fields of America
'.as did the soldiers of Frederick and Blucher
-in the old wars and Yon Moltke In the great-
Test European wars of recent years. [Great
: cheering.] The Government appreciated their
Splendid services. When the news of the fall
of Richmond reached Washington the people
assembled in large numbers at the residence
.of the Secretary of State. Responding to their
call for a speech, ' Mr. Stan ton said :\\ "I will
'bow write my., glowing dispatches. . What
Bhall I tell the King of Prussia?" â¢ He an-
; swered his own question with this glowing
tribute to our German citizens: "I will tell
him that the German have been faithful to
the Union standard, as his excellent Minister,
Baron Gerolt, has been constant in his friend
ship to the United States." [Tremendous ap
plause.]
My fellow-citizens, better 'or more faithful
soldiers never mustered under any flag, fight-
Ing for any cause, than those willing and
sturdy ; German- American volunteers. [Great
cheering.] ," The troops - who â¢ fought under
Wiilich and Siegel, Kautz and Austerhaulz,
Scl lrz and Heintzelman, Hartranft and Weit
zelÂ» were the equals of their trained kinsmen
of. he imperial armies of Germany. [Renewed
ch';ring.] You will remember that old Gen-
Willich used to boast laughingly: "Give
mcstwo brigades of mv corn-fed Western Ger
mt|is and I will land them on the north coast
ana take the empire." [Tremendous applause.]
General Sheridan, too, declared, after visiting
Ei. ; ope, where he studied the movements of
toi Pranco-Prussian â  War, that he saw no
triiops that excelled our own. either of the
Eastern or Western armies, and Abraham Lin
coln proclaimed over and over again that they
â¢were true, patriotic and faithful to the flag of
our country. [Great caeerlng.]
'Jut, my fellow-citizens, it is of the German-
American in peace that I would now speak,
conservative, : industrious, steady, ~ sensible,
hr nest, fond of home and family, a good citi
âand who could be fond of home and fam
ily and not be a good citizen? (Renewed
cheers and cries of ' Hurrah v for McKinley."]
Not deluded by false ; theories of finance, nor
m sled by catch phrases of the campaign. As
In the crisis [of the Civil War he was faithful
to the country â¢ and sustained the , flag, so in
every crisis since ! he had stood for the honor
and integrity of the Government of the United
States, always standing opposed to : inflation
and repudiation, no matter what the form or
nature of the guise in which the spurious
policies were "presented, V, [Applause.] More
than once " In the close States " daring
the struggle lor the resumption of specie pay
ments the German-American ; vote turned the
Kale in favor ;of = honest : finance and the Na
â¦ion's slighted faith, The German citizens do.
' not like either cheap men or cheap money.
[Applause and cries of, "You are right, they
don't."] They typify sturdy manhood in their
own lives and they insist upon Bound money
in their own business. [Great cheering.] It
is gratifying to every lover of his country this
year to feel that the German- Americans of the
United States are standing unitedly to-day for
protection to American industries, for protec
tion to American labor, in favor of doing our
work at home and by our American citizens.
[Enthusiastic applause and cries of "Hurrah
for Mckinley."]
They are in favor of dollars worth 100 cents
each and for the National honor, breaking
with their old party associations because that
party under its new leadership is committed
to inflation and a disordered currency. [Great
cheering.] We welcome them all, both for
what they are and what they have done, and
bid our German fellow-citizens godspeed in
every new effort In the broad fields of business
and statesmanship, to all of which they have
already contributed Â«o much. [Applause.]
Gentlemen, I highly appreciate the honor of
this call and the significance ol it m;re than I
can find words to express, and it will give me
sincere pleasure to meet and greet each one of
you personally. [Great cheering and cries of
"Hurrah for McKinley."]
TALKS TO THIS TRAVELERS.
McKinley Tell* Commercial Men of Pro
tection* Importance.
CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 29.â At 7 o'clock
the Commercial Travelers' McKinley Club
of Chicago arrived on a special train.
The Commercial Travelers' Club of Canton
and the Dueber Escort Club, 400 strong,
met the Chicago men at the station. At
10 o'clock the Chicago delegation marched
to Major McKinley's residence. There
were 500 men in line and the escort nuni-
Dered 500 also. The spokesman was G. J.
Corey, chairman of the National Execu
tive committee of the commercial men of
the United States. When he and Major
McKinley appeared on the porch there
was an outburst of cheering which lasted
several minutes. After Mr. Corey had
spoken a few words Major McKinley said :
Mr. Corey, gentlemen of tne Commercial
Travelers' Association and my fellow-citizens:
I am honored, greatly honored by the call of
this assemblage of commercial men, repre
senting great commercial interests and com
ing from every section of our common coun
try. [Applause.] Although you are accus
tomed to calling on people for what I believe
is chiefly your business, let me assure you
that you never made a call anywhere more
agreeable to your host than this call is to me,
and [cries of "Good! good I" and "Hurrah for
McKinleyl"] it would be pleasant to me per
sonally to meet you on any occasion, but it is
peculiarly gratifying to meet you now, coming
as a body to testify your unity and confident
devotion to the Republican principles enunci
ated by the National Republican Convention
of 1896. [Cheers.]
I recognize your inflence as one of the most
potent factors in political contests, and I am
glad to know that this year in a greater degree
â than ever before the commercial men of the
country are united in the cause of the Repub
lican party. [Tremendous cheering.] You
have not always been in such close agreement
with each other politically as now, but then
you have had experience for four years, or
nearly so, you have been attending the schools
in which all the rest of us have been pupils.
[Great laughter.] It has been a free school;
[renewed laughter] the tuition has been free
[continued laughter and cries of "Pretty costly
though"]; but the ultimate cost has been very
great. [Applause and cries of "That's right"]
No body of American citizens of -equal num
ber could properly have a deeper Interest in
the success of Republican principle than j i,
and none, I am sure can do so much
to secure their certain triumph as you.
[Great cheering and cries, "We will do
that all right, Major."] There is no more cer
tain barometer of the business of the United
States than the sentiment of the men of which
this body assembled here this morning is rep
resentative. You encourage the despondent
and quicken the lagging into fresh activity.
You give new hope and stimulate new effort
in that great body of business men upon whom
so largely depends the revival of business in
â  all parts of our . country. ' [Applause.] What
we want above all else, my fellow-citizens, is
confidence [cries of "good! good I"], and we
can't get confidence by threatening to revolu
tionize and repudiate obligations, both public
and private. [Enthusiastic cheering.] You
know the facts of business and can dispel the
theories of the dreamer and themisstatements
of the demagogue, and one thing I like
about the commercial travelers Is that
every one of them is for the United
States of America [great applause and
cries of "And for McKinley, too."], and
always stand up for America, [Cheers.] We
are all members of the great American family,
and those policies which are good tor one of
us are good lor all of us. [Cries of "That's
right!"] Those policies that are good for the
Eastern and Central States are good for the
West and the great Northwest. [Cheers.] We
have always practiced the" golden rule. The
best policy is "to live and let live," and to buy
and sell in a way that will best promote the
good of all. [Applause.] It never pays to buy
cheap goods from a rival whose object in sell
ing to you at a low price is to establish a busi
ness that will in time destroy your own.
[Great applause and cries of "That's right!"]
We want no cheap goods in this country at the
expense of free and honest American labor.
[Tremendous cheering and cries of "Hur
rah for McKinley!"] We want no cheap
goods whose production would require us
to introduce in â â¢ the United States in
dustrial ana social degradation. [Cries of
"You are right, we don't I"] Your spokesman
has eloquently enumerated several of the
great essentials to our welfare . and prosperity.
Protection, as he well said, is the true Na
tional policy, the foundation stone on which
must be reared the great structure of Ameri
can ascendency and progress, the system that
is preservative of all business, that steadily
advances this country to the proudest rank In
manufacturing, mining, trading and farming,
which it .always should occupyâ greater than
any other nation in the world. [Great ap
plause.] You will agree, I am sure, in the
proud claim of Henry Clayâ for it is just as true
to-day as ever beforeâ "The cause of protection
is the cause of the country and it must and
will prevail." It is founded in the interests
and affections of the people. Reciprocity, too,
the gift of Blame [applause] and Harrison [re
newed applause] to the Nation, deferred by
Garfield's untimely death, was a', last pro
claimed by that great President, statesman
and patriot, Benjamin Harrison. - [Tremen
dous applause and cries of "Hurrah for Mc-
Kinley 17] Reciprocity, the twin of protection
and the true handmaiden of prosperity, al
ready has a strong hold on the affections of our
people. Limited as her, opportunities have
been -he has always shown that she can be a
great factor in the trade of our country. What
we- want, gentlemen, is a reciprocity that is
fair, liberal and just to our own as well as to
other countries. ; , ;. â . â .
The policy of Harrison and Blame means
the supremacy of trade, not its injury. y It pro-'
poses new and larger -markets to our surplus
manufacturing and agricultural productsâ
not injurious competition, nor lessened trade.
A sound treasury, too, is. demanded alike by
every consideration of good government and
good. business. The Government must pro
vide revenue for â¢ all ' expenses or its credit
will be inconstant Jeopardy. Honest . money .
must always be the best money. [Cheers.]
That is the character of the money we have in
circulation -to-dayâ every dollar wortn 100
cents [tremendous applause] I in every country
of the world, and we propose to keep It there. .
[Enthusiastic cheering and cries of "When you
are elected, there is no doubt about that!"] If
there is one kind of money that Is good in
every civilized country of the world and an
other that passes [in only some parts ; of the
world, the \ people of the United States will
â  never be content with anything short of the
best. i [Great applause.] We have i been, doing
business on that basis since January 1, 1879.
We will continue that policy so long as we
have a Just regard for our honest obligations
and high standing as; a " Nation. [Cheers.]
Free silver at a ratio of 16 to 1, or about half
its true bullion value, , is not a â¢ full dollar.
[Cries of , "No, you bet it isn't."] Good money
never made times hard, and poor money never
made times good. [Tremendous applause and
waving of hats.] ;
â¢ My fellow-citizens, our contest this year is

need of the hour is work for willing hands;
work and wages for the unemployed [cries of
"That's right, Major!"] and a chance to earn
the good dollars which are now idle and are
only waiting in their hiding places for a
restoration of confidence. [Great cheer-
Ing.] Our contest is for the good faith of
the Nation and welfare ol the people and we
can proclaim with confidence the same su
preme faith in the people which upheld Lin
coln in every trial of the war. As he said: "In
telligence and patriotism and a firm reliance
in him who has never yet forsaken this favored
land are still competent to adjust In the best
way all our present difficulties." [Cries of
"That's right!"] In this faith we submit our
contention to the great tribunal of the people.
I thank you, my fellow-citizens, for the com
pliment and courtesy of this call. [Tremen
dous* cheering and cries of "Hurrah for Mc-
Kinley, the next President!'']

CARNAGE IN CONSTANTINOPLE.
British Troops Land to Suppress the
Horrors â The Sultan PowerlessâAmer
icans Are Safe.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Ttjbkey, Aug. 29.
Further details of the situation here show
a horrible condition of affairs. Secretary
Herbert of the British Embassy states
that he saw one of the municipal scaven
ger's carts heaped up with the bodies of
Armenian porters.
Upon the top of the load was the body
of a porter whose head was terribly bat
tered, but who was still alive. Mr. Her
bert noticed that the skulls of most of the
victims were cleft or battered.
The Italian Embassador who witnessed
the killing of a number of Armenians by
Turks, appealed to the officer of a passing
patrol to interfere on behalf of the Armen
ians. The appeal, however, was fruitless.
The officer refused the Embassador's
request, saying: "It is the people," and
proceeded on his way.
The Sultan, upon hearing that the guard
ships had landed bodies of men, begged
Mr. Herbert to withdraw them, but this
the latter declined to do until the rioting
had ceased.
Tne American College and bible-honse
were guarded by troops and the coll ccc
was visited by United States Minister Ter
rill, who wished to ascertain whether or
not the occupants were safe.
The Minister's appearance had a good
effect and he was assured by the Chief of
Police that everything would be done to
preserve order.

NAPOLEON'S QUEER WAYS.
Mme. Ducrent's Treatment of Him In
Her Anecdotal Hlgtory of France.
One of the most recent contributions to
the anecdotal history of France is the
volume of memoirs written by Mme. Du
crest and translated into English. Napo
leon's rudeness to men and women and
his "hen hussyism" are treated bare
handed, and she Bays that it was only on
the field of battle and other great emerg
encies that Bonaparte became the very
genius of self-possession. Still, even in
the minor relations* of life, Napoleon was
not invariably self- asserting and dog
matic. He had his tender and gracious
moments. Mme. Ducrest tells a pretty
anecdote of his kindness to a venerable
lady who belonged to the old regime, and
who was not disposed to become a sup
pliant to the new. As soon as Bonaparte
was raised to the consulate he sent for
her, rose to meet her as she appeared and
assured her he should feel pleasure in
granting her any boon she might think
fit to solicit.
It was all done in recognition of the fact
that she had once given him a prize at
school.'
"General," she said, "I have no right to
look for anything i" r om you. 1 '
"You have then forgotten, madame,
that it was from you I received my first
crown? You came with the Due d'Orleans.
to distribute the prizes at Brienne. and
when you placed on my brow the wreath
of laurel, which was destined to be the
precursor of so many others, you said :
'May it bring you happiness.' lam told
that I am a fatalist, therefore it is not sur
prising that I should remember what you
have forgotten. I t-hali be delighted to be
serviceable to you."
But the happiest portion of these Du
crest memoirs are those in which
"Madame Sans Gene" appears. The hum
ble wife of the humble soldier who after
ward became Marshal Lefebvre and
Duke of Dantzig, is here drawn to the life
in her vulgar nature, her magnificent
devotion to her husband and her loyal
friendship to those who were dear to her
in early life. She never ceased to display

FARMERS FURTHER INFORMED
Asked to Talk About Tariff, the Boy
Orator Deftly Dodges the
Issue.
HORNELLSVILLB, N. V., Aug. 29.â
Before a gigantic gathering of farmers at
Maple City Pane, near HorneJlsville, this
afternoon William J. Bryan severely criti
cized the third-ticket movement and those
who are taking part in it. Mr. Bryan was
at his best and spoke with an earnestness
approaching fervor. Fully 7000 people
were present, and the manner in which
they showed their appreciation of Mr.
Bryan's remarks gave them the title of
being one of the most enthusiastic audi
ences the candidate has addressed since
he started out from Chicago after his nom
ination. Mr. Bryan's voice was husky
when he began, but it soon gained strength
and came strong and clear before ' his dis
course was finished. He spoke as follows:
Fellow-citizens, I have not time to enter into
an elaborate discussion of the issues presented
to the people in this campaign, but I desire to
call attention to a few things which may assist
you in deciding on which side you should cast
your influence. There are certain things
which you have a right to consider. It is the
objectâ or, at least, it should â of the public
speakers to help their audiences to understand
the merits of disputed questions, and it is one
of the evidences of sincerity of purpose that
the person discussing the public issues shall
discuss them plainly, clearly, so that every
one can understand just what is said and just
what is meant. When ambiguous language is
used, when obscure expressions are em
ployed, it is an assured fact that the person
using them has something to conceal rather
than to make plain.
The good book speaks of certain persons who
love darkness rather than light, and the good
book gives a reason for that peculiar affection.
Do you remember what it is? They love dark
ness rather than light because their deeds are
evil. Whenever I find darkness employed in
the discussion of a question or in the state
ment of a position I am irresistibly reminded
of that Bible passage and conclude, that the
person who attempts to obscure does it be
cause he is not willing that other people shall
know what he believes and what he desires to
accomplish. When I hear a man talking
about sound money without telling what he
means by it I think he loves darkness rather
than light because his deeds are evil [ap
plause] and when I find that our opponents
are taking their arguments ' from people who
have not names lam afraid there is a purpose
in the obscurity.
Let me call your attention to something
which you will find at the top of the first
column of the first page of the Buffalo Courier
under great big headlines: "Ready to un
load." "Indiana bankers hope that Bryan
will win." "Great hoards of silver; they are
eager to dump it by the shipload on the
United States mints and to double its present
prices," Under these headlines I find the
special cablegram from that great city whence
comes most of the arguments of our enemies,
London, Eng. [Hisses.] In the course of an
interview to-day a leading Indian merchant
just returned from Calcutta said tome: "A
leading merchant" (name unknown).
[Laughter.] American politics is just now
of absorbing interest to Hindoo and Parsee
bankers and financiers as well as to
native potentates. Yes, my triends; for our
American politics is of absorbing interest to
all the nations of the earth, because we are go
ing to decide to govern ourselves. [Cheers.]
Therefore they are becoming interested. Con
tinuing the newspaper quotation : "All of them
possessing enormous hoards of silver, eagerly
desire Bryan's election and the chance thereby
afforded them to dump shiploads of bullion
into the United States mint at double the pres
ent price. So eager are they that I have heard
a well-founded rumor (an unknown person has
heard a well-founded;rumor) that a friend has
been found to aid the free-silver party by sup
plying campaign literature."
That is the end of the quotation from the
unknown Indian merchant, and â  the cable
gram adds: "My informant is a man of such
high commercial standard that I attach much
importance to this information." There is a
correspondent who does not sign his name
telling about a man of high commercial stand
ing, whose name he does not give, who quotes
what a leading merchant says, whose name is
unknown, and who gays that there is a "well
founded rumor" that certain things are going
to happen. [Laughter.] '
That, my friends, is the sort of argument that
is being spread before the American people.
Why do not these men who are giving opinions
give their names so we can find out who the
men are and what their opinion is worth? 1 But
lam afraid that they love darkness; rather
than light, because their deed are evil and
they dare not come out in the open light.
[Applause.] I call attention to this because
we can see by it what an unsubstantial foun
dation is laid for the iears which they attempt
to excite in the breasts of American ; citizens.
Let me give you another evidence of the lack
of candor and directness that characterizes
our opponents. . 'â :â â ' - . . -
Ex-Secretary Fairchild is quoted in this same
paper as saying: "I do not see how we can do
anything else than put a third' ticket in the
Preridential arena. We have practically com
mitted ourselves to such a course. We want to
see the defeat : of the Chicago 'â â¢ ticket, and we
shall try to draw away as many voters as we
can from it. We feel that their defeat may be
best accomplished by a third ticket. Of course
we shall find no fault with those of our friends
who cast a straight vote for McKinley. As to
whom the nominees will be I have not the
slightest idea." . v
Now, ; there, my, friends, is a party that
claims to be in favor of â  honest money, advo
cating the putting up of a ticket, not for the
purpose of electing the tickst, not for the pur
pose of voting for the ticket, but for : the pur
pose of electing another man whom they are
not willing to indorse in ; a convention. [Ap
plause.] I simply call your attention to the
methods which we have to meet in this cam
paign. And I ask you whether- these methods -
characterize a political party that is so devoted
to honesty is everything that it wants honest
mpney and sound dollars. [Derisive laugh
ter.] : > ..,. â  â ,;â ; . ::â :.. /. . Â\ â - : . .
Now, as against a party, v without : daring to
advocate a gold standard, yet declaring in
favor of its maintenance I until other . nations
come to our relief, and as against ; another so
called party that advocates the nomination of
a ticket, not for the purpose of electing it, but
for the purpose of electing another ticket, we
present a straightforward, emphatic declara
tion which is so clear that one who I runs may
read: "We . demand the immediate restora
tion of the free and unlimited coinage ot gold ;
and silver at the present ratio of 16 to 1, with
out waiting for the aid or consent of any other
nation on earth.'; I believe you have a right
to consider = the frankness, the candor : with
which these position* 'â - are ' stated when you
come to decide which side is honestly striving
to do that which is best for the American
people. .v .-'.".â Â«- â â  -Â: . .. :'â â  â -.._.â .:.:.-.
Â«f Now the gold standard is a good thing the
Republicans ought to have declared in favor of
Us perpetual maintainance. â  If ; the gold stan
dard is a good thing, i then the â  United States
ought to have it, and if the gold standard is a
bad thing, then bo foreign nation should be
permitted to force a gold, standard upon the
people of the United States.'^ [Cheers.] There
is not in that money platform of the Repub
lican party a single ray of hope. Are you sat
isfied with your condition ? If so, then why
do you not want to keep up a gold standard?
If you are not satisfied t with your â ; condition
are you willing to submit to the present condi
tions until other people take pity on us and
come to our rescue ? Â» [Applause.] - ;4 â¢ ? â  -\
That, my friends, Is the i position ;in whicb.-
we are placed ta this; campaign, no party dei
pending on a gold standard, and yet a great
party willing to surrender the right of self
government, willing to vest its legislative
powers in other lands and let them legislate
for the United States. [Hisses and shouts of
"Never, never."] I do not believe that the
American people will ever consent to receive
their mandates from over the ocean. [A voice
with, a strong Hibernian accent: "Johnny Bull
will never do it."]
For an hoar Mr. Bryan spoke on the
subject of silver, repeating former argu
ments in new phrases, and then a man in
the crowd asked Mr. Bryan to say some
thing; about the tariff.
"What is the use in discussing the tariff
question," Mr. Bryan responded, "nntil
we decide whether the United States has a
right to legislate on any question? [Ap
plause and laughter.] Why not submit
the tariff question to the international
agreement along with the money ques
tion? The tariff question compared with
the money question is absolutely insignifi
cant, and you cannot force the tariff ques
tion into a campaign where the people are
trying to decide their financial inde
pendence of every other nation on earth.
[Cheers.] It matters not how we may
differ on other questions, this is going to
determine the allegiance of people to
party this year, and if the syndicates can
leave the Democratic party in order to
prevent free silver I want to know why
laboring men and the farmers cannot
leave the Republican party in order to
destroy the gold standard. [Shouts of
"We will."] I believe that the way to make
people love their Government is not to call
them abusive names when they mnke
a just complaint, but to make the Govern
ment so good it shall deserve the love of
every citizen. Instead of telling you that
the Creator made a great many to toil and
a few to ride on the back of those who toil,
I come to renew your faith in the love of
independence which declares that all men
are created equal, and if all men are cre
ated equal, then no man, whatever his
name or position or lot in life, has a
right to injure another man, and that no
Government should either enable one citi
zen to injure another or permit one citizen
to injure another.
"I have not come here to beg your
votes, but I say that when you have read
my platform and understand what these
policies mean to you, if you then believe
that through the ticket nominated at Chi
cago you can best serve your country,
serve your rights and protect your fami
lies, then lam a bidder for your votes,
I care not to what party you belong. But
if, on the other hand, you believe
that the election of anybody else is
better for yourselves and your country,
then it would be criminal for you to cast
your votes for me. That is my idea of
politics. It is not the person, it is the
cause for which the person stands. It is
not the indorsement, it is the principles. I
stand for certain principles, and if elected,
I will carry them out to the best of my
abilities. So help me. [Loud and pro
longed cheering.)
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan were conveyed from
the fair grounds to the railroad station,
receiving a most enthusiastic ovation all
along tbe route, and at once started for
Jamestown.
OLEAN, N. V., Aug. 39.â Mr. Bryan
made the trip from Hornelisvilie to James
town in a special car furnished by the
Jamestown committee. On the train was
a committee of reception from Olean to
Jamestown. There were few stops. A
big crowd had gathered at Wellsville, but
the train whirled past so rapfdly that all
the candidate heard was tt.e echo of the
cheers and the faint strains of a band.
Cuba was tbe first stop. A. big crowd
was there and Mr. Biyan shook hands
with many. The train reached Olean at
6:20 p. m. and Mr. Bryan was given a rous
ing reception. Mr. Bryan spoke from the
rear platform of the car. laree thousand
people were in the crowd and tney cheered
with vigor.
JAMESTOWN, N. V., Aug. 29.- Mr.
Bryan arrived at the Jamestown station
at 7:40 p. h., and was greeted with cheers
by a thousand people gathered there and
along an embankment overlooking the
track. He and Mrs. Bryan were taken to
the Sherman House, whence, after sup
per, they were conveyed to Celeron, on
Chautauqua Lake, in a special trolley car.
Tbe convention hall at Celeron has a
seating capacity of 3000, but fully 4000
were jammed.into itlong before the Bryan
party came at 9 o'clock. Outside there
were thousands struggling to get to the
doors. The party was entirely without
police protection and had to fight hard to
keep from being crushed by the curious
men who swarmed around them.
When Mr. Bryan stepped upon the plat
form he was greeted with a fierce, shrill
cheer, which in its intensity suggested the
Chicago convention. Every one stood on
their chairs waving handkerchiefs, and
the cheers kept up for several minutes.
After this beean the trouble which came
almost to being a panic, and under the
conditions there a panic would surely
have resulted in loss of life.
Frank H. Mott introduced Mr. Bryan,
who stepped forward arc stood waiting
for quiet. The people ke,t crowding in at
the door and pressing to the front. Mr.
Bryan begged those in the aisles to get out
lest a panic should result and by word and
gestures implored them for order, but he
could not get i'_. Members of the commit
tee took* turns at exhorting the people to
keep back, but they were not heeded. One
excited- man in the eallery got a hearing
and cried: "Go out for heaven's sake.
There will be a panic and people will be
killed."
Mr. Bryan declared that he would not
speak under such dangerous conditions.
Mr. Sibley, one of the committee, an
nounced that Mr. Bryan would leave the
hall and talk in the open air if the people
would go out. Finally the intelligence
was conveyed to the people that Mr.
Bryan won 1 talk outside alter the inuoor
meeting and Mr. Sibley would talfc out
side immediately. Several hundred were
induced to leave and then, after thirty
minutes' struggling against the determin
ation of more people than the hall would
hold to hear him, Mr. Bryan was able to
begin his speech.
The address delivered was largely on
the lines of his speech at Hornellsville to
day. He pui the audience in good humor
immediately by the statement that when
so many people gathered together on such
an occasion and put themselves to so
much personal discomfort in a banner
Republican county, he was afraid to go
into any Democratic counties to speak.
He devoted himself almost entirely to
the issue of the campaign. At the out
side he predicted that there would be six
teen Republicans for every Democrat lost
by the Chicago ticket. He accused his po
litical opponents of having brought about
a panic to secure the accomplishment of
private ends. They forced issue after issue
of bonds regardless of price 3, and the tax
payers had to pay the prices.

Attorney, presided, and after making a
short speech presented the ex-Governor.
In opening his address Mr. Boies said that
the subject which called the meeting to
gether was one which overshadowed every
other since the great war.
" It is a subject,' ' he continued, " which
interests in the same way all classes of
people. The leaders of the Democratic
party arÂ« denounced for the alleeed at
tempt to appeal to class. McKinley haa
taffen the pains to allege that an appeal
has been made to the classes and an at
tempt made to divide the country on the
silver issue. By the very nature of these
things there must be classes.
The speaser then said that we are
affected differently by the money ques
tion. The American whose wealth is
money naturally wants the gold standard, j
for that makes his money more valuable, '
but the man who produces what must be i
sold for money will, if he understands it, I

NEW JAP AN A TREATY POWER.
Ftnailj Admitted to the Comity of Nations j
After Overcoming All \
Obstacles. \
TOKIO, Japas. Aug. 10.â Japan may !
no* be eaid io have .eve* -ier long
cberisfced ambition in the mat;er ot treaty .
reTisicn. England and tha U silted S:ates
led the way ia adrnituuz her to the
comity of nations: Italy, Russia, B isiam
and Denmark followed withoct mnch
difficulty; bat France haggled for many
months seeking tariff concession* almost
imco?sib!e for Japan to grant. T&ese ob- ,
stacles hare now SnaUy been overcome, â 
and the new treaty was signed on the 4:h
of Ausaat.
Earnest measures are in progress to j
restore co-operation between the American !
Boar i Mission and the trustees of the
college established by it in Kyoto. The
college is cal.ed the Do^nisha. It enjoys
a high reputation and has been in every !
way a most successful institution.
The new Governor-General of Formosa, I
lieutenant-General Viscount Kat^ura, j
does cot start for his ron until the middle
or end of October. He will be an excel- |
lent represents: of toe conciliatory pol- j
icy that the Government in Tokio his ;
always desired to pursue in that island.
There has been much talk in Japan ;
lately about providing money to build ;
roads, railways an harbors in Formosa j
and generally to develop the resource; o '
the md. It is calc :i-ted that at least
10O,CCO,<XO yen will be rpqeired within the
Lei: lew years, and some publicists advo- j
cate the raisins of a foreign and domestic
loan on the security- of the island. Bat it '
has been pointed out that tee revenue ot>- :
tamab.e from taxation in Japan nas a
iarse margin of expansion. For instance, '
there will be no diiSculty in trebling the j
tax upon sake (Japanese win**), of wnich :
the upper c a*sea drink 140,000.000 gallons j
annually. The Japanese anil not go abroad ;
for money so long as they can obtain It j
ea<Â« ly â I faomÂ». " \
The Korean statesmen now in power are |
struggling hard to prevent the Japanese i
from obtaining a concession to ouild a
railroad from Seoul to Fu-an. though ob- |
tiouslv the granting of such a concession ,
wouid be only just and natural. The old ;
pretext, desecra ion of ancestral sepal- j
chers in cons ractmg tne line, is strenu- i
ously advanced. If Japan submits to be â¢
thus discriminated against, when the '
United States and France (which means i
Russia, of coarse) have obtained conces
sions without 'difficulty, her prestige will!
suffer another severe shock.
Tne recent inundations caused by heavy ;
rams in Japan prove to have been much '
more disa-trous tuan was originally sup- J
posed. In Gi.u prefecture, where most â¢
damage -was done, 120,000 persons are '
without shelter or means of subsistence.
There has been much talk in Japan of j
ministerial changes, the idea being that i
Marquis Yama^ata's return from Europe â 
would signalize a general break-up of the
Cabinet. Bat events have completely
falsified that forecast. Marqais Yama"- f
gata, after a brief visit to Toiio, has re- )
tired to Kyoto :o recruit his health.
On Sunday, July 36, J. yon Haas, Aus- i
tro-Hunganan Consul at Shanghai, Mrs.
Haas and a party of friends, went from j
Ninzpo in the steamer Kiang-ten, and, â 
landing at Poo toe, proceeded to a bay at
some distance to bathe. There. was a ,
strong ebbtide running. Mr. Haas â¢
earned out by tee current, and his body j
has not been recovered.
An anti-Chruiian outbreak is now going
on ie Snanjtmjt. The rioters are members ;
of a society (the Tatao-hui) originally I
formed for purposes of mutual protection â 
against bandits, but said to have now be- '
come a bandit organization itself. There â¢
has for some time been a feud between
this society and the native Catholics, and >
it cv minated recently in tne society send
ing out luOO men to d troy all the Catholic j
property they :. aid lay ban Is on. It is [
not yet reported wcetber lives have been i
taken, out tnirty Catholic stations are said j
to have been destroyed. Four thousand :
soldiers have been dispatched against the >
insurgents.

[Copyright, 1896, by the New York Times.]
LONDON, E>-g., Au?. 29.â Nicholas II
has made his first appearance in the west
and has retreated again, leaving Europe
more uncertain about tne immediate
future than before. For some reason
Vienna expected great things of his visit.
Even the official papers were inspired to
say that political questions of the highest
importance would probably be settled
while the Czar and his advisers were in
the Austrian capital. This seems, how
ever, to have been a mistake. All that
Vienna saw of the Czar was at the rail
way station. When he arrived there
people noted that he was pallid with an
indescribably tired face. He looked very
small and weak beside his tall, haughtily
beautiful wife as she alighted from the
train dressed in a robe oi azure satin,
heavily embroidered with silver, her hat,
plumes, mantle, shoes and parasol of the
same color, but without gloveg. There to
greet her, attired in deep plain black, was
the Empress of Austria, who had not been
6een in public by the Viennese before
since the suicide of her son.
Privileged correspondents observed that
the two women kissed and then began to
converse in German, while the Czar and
the Austrian Emperor spoke French.
Then walis> of bayonets closed about the
party and hid from view their progress to
the Hofburg, and secluded them utterly
for two days, while windstorm and tor
rents played havoc with the street decora
tions. Now their Majesties have gone as
they came, and Vienna learns that not
only is nothing changed for the better,
but at the formal banquet of welcome,
while the Emperor spoke of "the new tie
of friendship which unites us" the Czar
coldly refrained from adding a single
word to a bare acknowledgment of the
toast. It had been said that Prince
Lobanoff would remain behind at Vienna
tor a week to arrange the details of some
large and beneficent political compact,
but he too is gone.
That there has been a hitch is only too
manifest. What it is no one knows. Only
last Tuesday France was authoritatively
â¢informed that the Czarina would certainly
accompany her husband to Paris. To-day
it is announced from Vienna that she is
not well enough to undergo tbe fatigue of
traveling, and will remain in Russia, while
the Czar makes his other visits at once.
Although there exists a certain physical
pretext ior this, it is perfectly compre
hended that the plea is merely a pretext,
for princesses are trained from childhood
to undergo weakness and to withstand
fatigues in the interest of dynastic poli
tics, to which plain people can afford to
yield. If it had been (teemed desirable
that sne should appear at Bre^lau or at
Paris tnere is no doubt whatever that she
N would co. There is room for the suspicion
that she will be too tired to visit Breslau,
but will recover sufficiently to journey by
sea to France. This would turn the whole
tour of the Czar into a demonstration
against what is left of the Triple Alliance,
and from Vienna's conception of the
spirit on which it begun there this seems
not unlikely.
While the Emperor was toasting the
Czar at Vienna the streets of Constanti
nople were running with Armenian blood.
Perhaps the tidings of this renewal of
murderous rioting nt, Stamboul had their
effect upon young Nicholas' nerves. At
tbe beginning of this month Bishop Sat
terlee of Washington, on behalf of the
Anglo-American Committee, obtained a
personal audience with the Czar and
Czarina and read to them a petition in
volving a full recital of the atrocities that
have been committed upon the Armenians
by the Turks, and though the Czar made
no definite response the Bishop saw evi
dences that he was hearing a good deal of
this for the first time.
Previously the Bishop had been warned
by the palace officials that the mere men
tion of Armenians would suffice to pre
vent the Czar from receiving him, but he
stuck to his guns and even added refer
ences to Crete to his talk. Three days
later the Bishop was received by the
Dowager Empress, who revealed the fact
tnatshehad been told that the intrigues
of American missionaries bad made all
the trouble in Armenia. She was greatly
touched by the Bishop's narrative, anil
when he snoke of the duty of Christian
nations to interfere and stop these horrors,
she wrung her hands and cried, "Oh, if
they only would."
These incidents, which I have from an
absolutely trustworthy source, suggest in
teresting thoughts about what may be in
the Czar's mind now that Constantinople
is again in convulsions and a new slaugh
ter of Armenians has begun, whic 1 will
probably run its course all tnrongh Asia
Minor. The fact that a small group of
Armenian fanatics deliberately provoked
this new cycie of massacres is insisted on
& good deal at the moment, but it may be
lost sight of later on.
To use their own phrase Armenians
"wanted to thrust their tinker in the eye
of Europe." One can hardly wonder that
the spectacle of Cretans at once securing
the sympathy and effective protection of
the powers, while the unspeakably greater
misery and martyrdom of their own people
brought no help, should infuriate tbe
Armenians. It is true that they are not a
likable race in the sense that Cretans are,
but, after all, they are human beings, and
their cup of wrelchednass is running over.
It is believed here that within a fortnight
the whole Turkish question will reach ar
stage of greater gravity and more immi
nent danger than has exist' d before since
tbe treaty of Berlin was signed.
The Paris press is running riot with wild
suggestions for symbolical novelties with
which to welcome the Czar. The unmeas
ured enthusiasm of tho^e who want to be
have as if the Czar's visit were the great
est event in her history naturally provoked
cooi heads like Ciemenceau to oppose the
whole business with perhaps gratuitous
sharpness.
This disposition to criticize tbe value
of the Russian connection altogether is
getting hold of the French radicals gen
erally, and the fact that at Vienna the
person to whom the Czar gave the longest
private interview was the Duo d'Orleans
greatly helps forward the growing sns
picion in their minds that the Russian
court party means mischief to the re
public.
England's Foreign Office needs long
years for meditation over such a problem
as arbitration with Venezuela, but it can
settle such an issue as that ot Zanzibar in
three-quarters of an hour. There is no
criticism here on any phase of that affair
save regret that the island was not de
clared a colony off hand and without ap
pointing any new Sultan. Germany is in
a position to be unpleasant if she chooses,
and earlier reports were to the effect that
iriction was expected. It appears, how
ever, that the German traders on the
mainland rather prefer to have England's
authority extended on the island, espe
cially as against slavery, because that
angers the Arabs and tends to make them
boycott Zanzibar itself and trade on the
German coast instead. This practical
view, it is believed, will shape Berlin's
policy.
Those financiers in London who are con
cerned in Brazilian properties were ren
derea apprehensive this week by certain
private news which they received from
Rome. One large company adout to be
floated found itself suddenly abandoned
by the underwriters owing to a warning
from Italy that trouble was certain.
Nothing very definite appears as a basis
for this scare, which is apparently founded
on a general notion that the Italian
Ministry will not neglect such an inviting
opportunity for playing to the popular
gallery and that it will make a great show
of bellicose firmness with Brazil. The
Italians are very sore about the systematic
abuse to which their emigrant laborers
have been subjected in the south of France
and the lynchings in Louisiana have also
made a deep impression. Nothing could
be done as against France or the United
States, but Brazil is a different matter,
and no doubt a display of vigorous ac
tivity on the part of the Italian Govern
ment would be very popular. It is hardly
likely to proceed, however, beyond the
safe limits of diplomatic representations.

SAN RAFAEL PAPER CHASE
Mr. Archibald and Miss Curry
Give the Hounds a Merry
Race.
Galiop Up to Hotel Rafael Two Min
utes Ahead of Their Pur
s tiers.
SAN KAFAEL, Cat-, Aug. 29.â Interest
in the paper chase increases weekly, and
large crowds to-day witnessed the start
and finish, which were both at the club
house of the Hotel RafaeL Never before
has the management of the hotel been
able to so really interest and entertain its
guests, for society actually appears en
thusiastic over the paper chase and locks
forward with pleasure and eagerness to
Saturday afternoon.
Umpire Crooks started the haresâ J. F.
J. Archibald and Miss Frances Curry â at
3:30 o'clock. These two were the' winning
hounds last week. Fifteen minutes after
they rode through the south entrance to
the hotel the hounds started at a lively
pace.
Among the hounds were Baron Yon
Schroeder, Frank Johnson, Frankie John
son, Frankie Glass, Miss Jqlliffe, Miss
Thomas, Mr. Dibblee, Benjamin Thomas,
Lieutenant Burgess, Miss Barber, Captain
Wegener, Mr. Boardman, Consul Aristo
movitch, Dx. Howitt, Mrs. J. J. Crooks,
Mr. and Mrs. Bruce, Mrs. Farnsworth,
Miss Foster, Miss Warburton, Miss Wu
kins, Miss Owin and Mrs. Johnson.
The traps followed the umpire out of
the east entrance and rode beyond the
Donahue track, where they had a good
view of the hounds as they wound around
the Hills south of San Rafael. Miss War
burton was able Â»o follow but a short way
on account of tne sickness of her horse.
This was a great disappointment to her
friends, who were anxious to see her win.
Several of the carriage parties drove to In
spiration Point, one of the high hills back
of Mr. Johnson's residence, and there a
biruseve view of the chase on tne hills and
marsh below was obtained.
Gradually every one began to drive
back toward the east entrance of the
hotel, and at 4:30 o'clock the hares, un
cauglit, dashed into , the hotel grounds.
In less than two minutes the first of the
hounds galloped up. Dr. Harry Howitt
and Frank C. Glass were about on a line,
but as they turned to go through the
pates Glass gained a little, so he was the
first hound and Dr. Howitt the second.
Mrs. Farnsworth was the first hound
among the ladies and won honorable
mention. Mrs. Crooks and Miss Bruce
had lost the scent and had come in
through the south entrance, which was
not the course. In less time than it takes
to tell it Mr*. Crooks bad whirled her
hor.Â«e around and had retraced her steps
until she reached tue right course, and,
following it, arrived at the hotel the sec
ond hound among the ladies.
The prizes were a silver-mounted bridle,
compliments of J. C. Johnson & Co. ; a
riding stick, compliments of Mr. Wegener,
and a cut glass water bottle given by J. J.
Crooks.
Those in carriages to follow the
chase were Judge and Mrs. W.
W. Morrow, Mr. and Mrs. A. W.
Foster, Mrs. C. B. Scott, Mr. and Mrs.
Sydney M. Smith, the Misses Smith, Mrs.
Gerstie, Mr. and MrÂ«. Jerry Burke, Miss
Burke, Warden and Mrs. Hale, Miss Sadie
Hale, Mrs. Webster Jones, Miss Hobbs,
Mrs. Johnson, Mrs. Glass, Mrs. Bontag
and Mrs. Bovee, Andrew and Walter JMar-
Mn, MÂ»jr>T Tharp and wife, Mr. and Mrs.

AN ACCIDENT IN THE HURDLES
One of the Jockeys Is Thrown and
Suffers Injuries That May
Prove Fata!.
DEL MONTE, Cal.. Aug. 29.â The Bnr
lingame Country Club meet is destined to
close in a blaze of jtlory, despite its unpro
pitious beginning. Everybody is more
than satisfied, and consequently in high
good humor. The dance last night was a
great success, and the races this afternoon
showed quite the old-time enthusiasm and
spirit.
Private traps were out in full force and
filled with beautifully gown-d ladies, and
jollity reigned supreme. The good run
ning of the horses was greatly applauded
by fair hands.
A sudden, heavy shower of rain came up
toward the close of the races, and though
it dampened the pretty frocks and dainiy
parasols which tried so ineffectually to
offer protection, it had no perceptible
effect upon the general gajrety.

doubt, and the downpour lasted only a
few moments.
One unfortunate occurrence marred the
sports of the day to those who were aware
of it. One of the jockeys was thrown upon
.a hurdle that his horse refused to take
and so badly injured that it is feared he
will not recover.
"It was only a jockey," some one said,
but "only a jockey" must face eternity, as
well as the rest of the Burlingame con
tinerent.
The last day of the Burlingame rreet
was an eventful one at the Del Monte
baths. It seemed as though the tanks
were alive this morning, and that all
swelldom was there.
It was too monotonous indoors, how
ever, and one by one they filed out to take
a merry dip in the surf. It was, indeed, a
nierry dip. ' Every one teemed co jolly
anyway this morning, and the cold suri of
Monterey Bay doubly imbued the bathers
with the idea that they were in for a pood
time and that they must have it. They
succeeded admirably.
After the swim wheeling seemed in or
der; at least, the private wheels were oat
en masse. One party of young people
even went so far as to try to make the
maze on their wheels, but gave it up as a
bad job. After the dip in the surf and
wheeling nothing was talked of but the
races for the afternoon. Of course every
one who had a private rig was going, and
those who did not would hire one of the
Del Monte.
In the first race this afternoon Hobart's
Lady Green Sleeves, J. S. Tobin's Mab and
11. M. Tobin's Li Hung Chang went to tue
post. In all three cases the owners rode
their horses. As usual Li Hung Chang
was no match for Lady Green Sleeves, for
right from the start the latter animal led
easily. Mab was not far behind the
"Chinaman."
The second event was a professional
race, one mile and a sixteenth. There
were three scratches, leaving six to start.
The betting was brisk. Duke Steven took
the lead from the jump and kept it all the
way around without any trouble and
came under the wire fully eight lengths
ahead of Trix. The time, 1:52 J. 2 ', was
fast considering the condition ot tae
track.
Tbe third race was a one-mile handicap
for the Del Monte cop. Only two started
â Hobart on bis Gold Coin and Bapgett
on J. Lawson's Milkmaid. Milkmaid was
not in it from tbe start, Gold Coin win
ning easiiy.
The fourth event was a "scrub race" for
ponies or horses owned and ridden by resi
dents oi Monterey County. This race
caused more real merriment than Â«ny
other, and it was a good one. There were
three entries. San Mount led to the
homestretch, when Ruby came up, passed
him and won.
Next was the two-mile steeplechase.
This was the race that White had so much
trouble in starting. Morgan G was de
cidedly the favorite at the pool box. All
horses made the first and second hurdles
nicely, but the water jump was refused by
Jim Corbett.
Finally Maynard, his rider, succeeded,
out Corbett fell and threw the rider
against the fence. Maynard was uncon
scious at a late hour to-night, and his re
covery is doubtful. Dr. Shiels of San
Francisco attended him.
The sixth and last event of the day was
a mile and a half steeplechase. It was
won by Li Hung Chang, ridden by Tobin.

NO SALE FOR SAPPHIRES
G Le r evre of Chemulpo Talks of
the Business Stagnation
There.
Something About the Scenes of tbe
Recent Battles â A Lonesome
Place for Europeans.
G. Lefevre, a merchant of Chemulpo,
Korea, where the great Japanese battle
was gained over tbe Chinese, is at the Oc
cidental, having arrived here yesterday on
the steamer Rio. Mr. Lefevre has been
two years there 'in business and is now
en route to visit his old home In Paris.
He says business is poor over all that
part of Asia, and he does not look for im
provement very soon.
*
"The commercial outlook is very bad,"
he said. "It is quiet ana there is nothing
"that in any way looks like trouble, but
'there is almost no business. All the firms
in Korea are either Japanese or Chinese,
with the exception of five.
"Of these five four aia in Chemulpo and
oneinGensan. In Chemulpo one firm in
American, one French and two German.
The house in Gensan is Russian. The
climate is very pood except m winter,
which lasts through NÂ«vember, December,
January and February, and is dry and
coid, and July and August, when it 13
very wet. Tnere is not much snow in that
part of Korea.
"The sapphire mines of Korea, which
have attracted considerable attention for
some years past, are not being worked
now. As to the copper mines, which are
also owned by the Government they are
being worked. It is from these mines
that the Government gets its copper to
make into coins.
"Up m the district of Ping Yang, in the
north of Korea, are the gold mines, which
have ior a good while been discussed. Tlie
Government has just let a concession on
them to an American company, and next
year the mines are to be worked. It is in
the district of Ping Yang, you remember,
where one of the great battles in the re
cent war was fought."
â¢ Mr. Lefevre will go on to Prance in a
day or two. He says it is very lonesome
for a European in Chemulpo, and he is
glad to get away for a while.
Pat Had the Last Word.
A short time ago an Irishman was going
througn the street with a horse attached
to a cart full of coal, when a man, think

PROVISIONING NEW YORK.
About 8100,000,000 Worth of Eggs and
' Dairy Products Used r Annually.
'{, "Feeding a City Like New York," an ar
ticle : by ; John, Gilmer Speed in July
Ladies' Home Journal, presents some In-'
teresting k and astonishing statistics. For
instance, Mr. Speed ; declares that ' New
Yorkers consume 80,000,000 dozen eggs per.
year, for which > they - pay $14,400,000; i
290,800 r pounds of butter per day, costing
$18,200,000 per year; 297,000 gallons of
milk, 5600 gallons of cream and 1200 gal
lons of condensed milk daily* at 'a yearly ,
outlay of $16,250,000. ;; Including â  cheese,
for which $10,000,000 per year :is ; paid, the
aggregate value of the dairy products con
sumed in New York City is $44,450,000.
Mr. Speed fixes the valuation of the meats
of various kinds sold to New Yorkers each
year at about $48,000,000. . \ â¢.â 
This : does J not include 'â  poultry, from
200,000 to 400,000 : head of . which 5 are < sold
weekly. \ Upon â  a?. conservative t estimate
Mr Speed places the quantity of fish con
sumed r yearly >in Â» New * Yorfe at 45,000,000
pounds, not v including r oysters, ; clams
crabs and other shellfish. : There are 24 000
bushels lof s potatoes i sold in ; New a Yord
daily;;. the yield -of a 90,000-acre farm per
year, the aegregate value of the tubers be
ing $13,000,000. - Other vegetables are con-
Sa!^ \ like Proportions. There ; are
70,000 bushels of wheat (flour) eaten every
week, besides large quaatiea of oatmeal,
buckwheat flour and cornmeal. The quan
tities of r provender I always on hand (the
perishable goods being kept in cold-storage
warehouses) leads Mr. Speed to conclude
that were New York cutofi ixom all the
points from whence her food supplies are
drawn her people could live in plenty for
four months, and even manage to get
along for half a year without emulating
the Chinese appetites for rats.
A London Demonstration.
A great demonstration of domestic ser
vants took place on the banks of the Ser
pentine in Hyde Park lately. Most of
those present were women. The chairman
was a butler, and the speakers included s
coachman, a groom, a housemaid, two
footmen and a buttons. Their chief griev
ances were first the character system,
which they wished to have remedied by
legislation making it compulsory oa mas
ters to give good characters when de
served, and next, the unhealthiness of the
sleeping-rooms for servants. Among the
lesser complaints were having to be up
early after sitting up all night while tiieir
employers were at parties, the uniriendli
neÃs of the relations between master and
man, while one of the footmen presented
the novel grievance that he was asked to
clean up the family bicycles.
Not an island has risen or sunk from
sight in the Pacific Ocean in thirty-four
years, and geologists say that nature is
resting for a future mighty effort. A
gee logist predicts that within fifty years
a convulsion of nature will sink the whole
of New Zealand filty feet beiow the sur
face of the sea.

The State is again a sufferer. The ship
Yosemite has a cargo of coal for up the
river. In order to save w harfage the ves
sel halt been anchored in the stream and
the coal is transferred to barges. When
the latter are loaded the river steamers go
alon -side and tow them to points on the
San Joaquin and Sacramento.
John Lund, cockswain of the Camanche,
is a very sick man. Yesterday the sur
geon of the Alert was summoned and the
chances are that another sailor will have
to be drafted from Mare Island to take
care of the Naval Reserve monitor.
Mooney Broke His Ankle.
B. Mooney, night watchman at the Bay City
market, got into a dispute early yesterday
morning with the driver of a wagon. A fight
followed, and Mooney was thrown to the
ground, breaking his right ankle. He was
taken to the Receiving Hospital.
A FORTUNE FOR A FEE,
Attorney W. E R Hart Re
ceives $400,000 Frcm the
Blythe Estate
Sued for Money Advanced by W. F.
Goad When the Litigation Was
in P-ogreÂ«s
W. H. H. Hart has received a fee of
$400,000 from Florence Biythe-Hinckley
for his services in her behalf in the litiga
tion over the estate of Thomas 3iythe At
least that is what W. F. Goad claims in a
complaint filed in the County Clerk's of
fice yesterday. It seems that Hart bor
rowed $10,000 from Goad some time ago,
giving as security for the money an agree
ment to pay Goad the $10,000 and interest
out of the first money he received for ser
vices as attorney in the Blythe litigation
then pending.
Hart had an agreement with James C.
Perry, guardian~of Florence Blythe, by
the terms of which Hart was to receive
Vl x A per cent of the estate in case his client
won. Subsequently another aereement,
under date of February 29, 1896, was made,
by the terms of which Hart's 12% per cent
of the estate was to be allowed to remain
with the major part, and he was to receive
one-eighth of the income from month to
month.
The value of a one-eighth interest in the
estate is $400,000 and Goad claims that by
reason of the agreement Hart has received
compensation for his services and, there
fore, sues for the $10 000 due. An order
for a sale of the property is asked and such
other Tel ief as the court may deem equit
able.
At the same time that the complaint
was filed in the County Clerk's office, At
torney Goad haa a writ of lis pendeus
recorded covering Attorney Hart's interest
in the Biythe estate. The writ enumerates
all of the Blythe properties in this City
and the country real estate as well. This
will have the effect of Dreventing a settle
ment of the estate until the litigation is
settled or a bond sufficient to cover the
amount in dispute is forthcomin \.
TENNIS CRACKS COMING
Neel, Liarned and Wrenn, Three Eastern
Champion*, to Compete at
San Rafael.
Prirate advices received here yesterday
state that tbree great Eastern tennis
players are soon coming to California.
They are Robert D. Wrenn, holder of the
singles championship of America; Carr B.
Neel of Chicago, formerly an Oakland
boy, who with his brother recently won
tne donbles championship of America,
and W. S. Lamed, the runner-up at the
National tournament held at Newport.
A special tournament will be arranged
on tne San Rafael courts for these visitors
and tho cracks of California. The date of
the meet is not definitely settled but an
endeavor will be maae not to have it con
flict with the regular fall tournament.
This meeting will probably give one of tbÂ«
Hardy brothers an opportunity to meet
Neel, who was a fellow clubman of tbe
Hardys when they were all developing in
to skillful players several years ago in
Oakland.

POP FLIES VERSUS
BOURBON SPIDERS
They Decide Not to Be
Swallowed Alive With
out Salt
NEW POPULIST WEEKLY
It Will ,Be Issued First Septem
ber 12 and Will Favor
Watson.
THE PASTY EDITOKB OBJECT.
Cold Water Said to Be Thrown on tne
Under takr<? by the Voice
o. Labor.
The Populists in thin City will start a
weekly paper. Middle-of-the-road men
do not oropose to surrender everything
to the Democrats, and so they are going
to establish an organ of their own, a
I weekly, for which a large sum of money
I baa already been subscribed by wealthy
advocates of Populistic doctrines.
While strongly championing the elec
tion of Bryan the paper will vigorously
object to Watson's being relegated to the
position of tail to the Democratic kite.
That is, some of those interested in the
â  venture so assert, while others are
slightly dubious, and do not know
whether they are willing to throw a
bombshell upon tne chance of fusion or
not.
The idea of such an organ was evolved
about three weeks ago, when a California
journalist, well known also in the legal
profession, approached certain members
of the Populist 8tate Executive Commit
tee and proposed the plan to them. If it
met with favor in their eyes, he stated, he
would be perfectly willing to undertake
the management of the paper.
After a good deal of powwowing in the
Peoples party wigwam the idea was
finally declared to be feasible.
The paper will be published under the
management of the State Executive Com- j
mittee.
The field has already been canvassed,
and a^ a purely business venture it is
deemed a success. Every Populist will be
asked to use his best efforts to forward !
the interests of the paper.
The first issue will come from the press
September 12. At least, tha paper will be
issued on that date if nothing untoward
occurs to mar the harmenious action of
, the gray-beanied chiefs of the wigwam
Pointful.
Hon. J. Taylor Rogers yesterday admit-
I ted that such a weekly is to be issued. He
said it is not to be considered as a news
| paper, but simply as a political weekly,
devoted to the iut-.rests of the People's
; party in this State.
"It will be a bright, oreezy paper of
j about the size of the Argonant,' 1 he added,
: "and will probably be edited by Populists
of high standing in the community. The"
i management will be under a California
I journalist, who has also a copious knowl
! edge of the law.
'The first issue will be on September 12.
When I mention this date it must be un
derstood that the statement is not iron
i clad. Something may occur in the
! interim to warrant a change."
Dr. George W. Daywalt also admitted
the important facts of the case.
: 'We have long felt the need," he said,
"of a paper that will speak forth the true
Democracy of Jefferson, the exalted Re
publicanism of Lincoln, and wilj appeal to
! the patriotism of all parties to get the
administration of government back to the
i fundamental truths of political economy."
But there is a bare poss.biiity that the
\ weekly may yet fail to cast its sparkling
| rays o'er the multitude and set up a !
I rivalry to the shining orb of day. E. S.
I Barney, editor of the "Voice of Labor." \
I from purely philanthropic motives per
j naps, is known to be bitterly opposed to it
and is using all his influence, the knowing
ones whisper, to discourage the move
! ment. Many other editors of Populist
| organs throu bout the State who have
i been consulted are secretly throwing cold
j water on the project.
CHIN ESE CHILDREN.
A Decision by Judge Troutt Which
May Form a Precedent.
It is feared by tbe Methodist Chinese
i Mission that Judge Troutt's decision with
, regard to the two little Chinese children
i taken from a disreputable house on Ross
â  ailey will form a precedent which will
make it almost impossible to rescue
Chinese children from immoral parents
hereafter.
"The Judge decided that the officers of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children bad no right to go in and take
(,he children from their parents without
first citing them to appear in court," said
Mrs. Hull of the mission yesterday. "I
have not the least lack of confidence in
the honesty of the Judge's decision, but
any one who is used to dealing with this
class of Chinese knows that the children
would instantly be spirited away if legal
steps were taken.
"Judge Coffey may give us letters of
guardianship for the two little children
found at 23% Ross alley, but I have very
little hope that they will ever be produced
in court.'
Mrs. Hull believes that there will be no
difficulty in proving that the alleged
mother of the children is not the mother
at all. "She is a woman who has been in
the habit of buying and s-lling little slave
girls for the last fifteen years. We have
two girls in the home now whom she im
ported from China and who escaped from
slavery in her house."
WASHINGTON'S ADIEU.
Its Centennial Will Be Celebrated by
the Sons of the American
Revolution.
Next Thursday will be the one hundred
and thirteenth anniversary of the treaty
of Paris, whereby the United Colonies
were acknowledged to be sovereign and in
dependent States. It is an occasion which is
each year appropriately honored by the So
ciety of Sons of the American Revolution
tbrouenout the entire Union, and while
the coming anniversary will not be so ex
tensively observed by the California soci
ety as usual, there will be an important
stated meeting held in the rooms of the
society in Pioneer Hall that evening.
On this occasion, in addition to the
proper observance of historical matters,
there will be voted for admission to mem
bership a large number of applicants,
among whom are Thomas Allen Perkins,
Eugene de Kav Townsend, Edward Olney,
Hart Hyatt North, Charles A. Sumner,
George Whitney Reed, William Heneage
f'lnch, George R. Presson, Leonard Stock
well Clark, Bethnei M. Newcomb, William
Gilman Badger and Captain James Wil
liams.
One reason why the coming anniversary
of the treaty of peace will receive less than
usual attention, is owing to the fact that
the California society is making extensive
preparations for observing the one hun
dredth anniversary of Washington's fare
well address 10 the people, which will
take place Saturday evening, September
19. The occasion will be made brilliant
by addresses delivered by Hon. Horace
Davis, E. P. Cole, Colonel John S. Mosby
and other eloquent speakers. Judge E. W.
McKinstry, president of the society, will
be chairman, and ut the banquet, which
will be at the California Hotel, there will
be assembled several hundred of the
brightest talent in San Francisco, embrac
ing medicine, the clergy, the law, journal
ism and every other profession.
ANOTHER STORE ADDED
Joe Poheim, the Well-Known Tailor,
Opens Another Handsome Place
on Market Street.
There is not a better known merchant
tailor on the coast than Jce Poheim. For
many yeara past he has been supplying
his legion* of customers stylish, perfect
fitting clothing made to order at a low,
and in many cases, lower prices than
clothing ot equal grade caD be had for
ready made. During these years he has
built up a splendid reputation and a con
stantly increasing business and in order
to accommodate his rapidly growing trade
Mr. Poheim has found it necessary to open
another store at 846 Market street, just
opposite Fourth.
This makes four stores that he has in
operation in this City â one at the corner
of Montgomery and Bush stree is, another
! at 724 Market street and a third at 1110
! ami 1112 Market street.
Mr. Poheim attributes hi< success to the
I fact that be always deals squarely with
all his customers. His stock is an immense
one, of varied grades and patterns, and in
cludes every fabric used in the manufac
ture of men's clothing. In fit he is with
out a superior, as he employs none but
high-class cutters.
The best oi workmen are employed and
every garment is most carefully finished.
The" best of trimmings and linings are
used and the finished garments equal in
i every respect those turned out by the
j swellest tailors in the lauci.
There is only one difference. It is the
price. Poheim's clothing, while equal to
the best, costs only about one-half what
others charge. tor instance, $10 will buy
a good suit, $15 an excellent one, $20 one
that is a thoroughbred, while $25 will buy
a suit that most other places ask $40 or $50
for. Mr. Pobeim cha'lenges comparison
wi;h any other tailors in the land and
says that in the all-important essentials of
fabrics, fit, finish and trimmings he is far
j and away in the lead of all competitors.
j On this question he is willing that any of
his icng-time customers shall be the
judge â confident that they will uphold all
his claims of superiority for his made-to
order clothing.

WOMEN PREPARING
FOR BATTLE,
The Campaign to Open With
a Monster Mass-
Meeting.
GREAT PREPARATIONS.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman-Catt Will
Make Her Debut in San
Francisco.
Encouraging News of Equal Suffrage
in All P rts of the
S te.
On the evening of the 10th of Septem
ber tne Woman Suffragists will open their
battle for the ballot in California. The
opening engagement will take the form of
a mass meeting in Metropolitan Temple,
and promises to be a grand affair.
"Thus far." exclaimed Mis^ Mary Hay,
chairman of the State Central Committee,
"our work has been of a preparatory
nature. To be snre there have been talks
j and skirmishes, out we were only testing
i our weapons, so to speak. The fight will
commence on the 10 h of September, and
I can assure you that it will be kept up
until the very day of the election. Then
we will be able to rest on our laurels.
"We are taking measures to render our
coming rally a great event in the political
history of this State. Californians seem
to love music, so we shall have a little of
| San FranciÂ«co's best, which I know is far
'â  ahead of that heard in many larger cities.
As for speakers each political party will
contribute its best orator for the occasion.
while we women will do what we can.
Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw are well
known for their eloquence by this time, so
jwe will have a new attraction in Mrs.
i Carrie Chapman-Catt, whose oratorical
I powers have called forth innumerable
I plaudits from Eastern audiences.
"Mrs. Catt can almost be called a Cali
; fornian, as she has passed many years of
! her life in this State. She :s one of the
\ most charmine women I ever met and has
! a way of gaining the sympathies of her
j hearers which is truly magnetic. Her
I debut before a San Franciico audience is
> sure to be a brilliantly successful one, and
we count ou her as one of the big guns of
the campaign.
"By the w-.y," con tinned Miss Hay, "I
ought to say something about the way in
; Tvhicu The Call's stand for woman suf
: frage has affected our movement. People
: in the interior look upon it as our official
I paper. It may seem rather early to crow
I over our expected success, but I venture
: the prediction that when November comes
] it will be found that The Call has been
! with the winning horse.
"In obedience to directions from this
i bureau, the county organizers waited
upon tbe chairmen of all the political
cJuhs in the interior towns with a view to
ascertain whether suffragist speakers
would be acceptable at the larger meet
ings. In every instance the proposals met
with the most cordial acceptance. Not
J permissions to speak, but pressing invita
.! tions to do so have come from Republican,
Democratic nnd Populist leaders all over
the State. My time is so much taken up
in the making of appointments for lec
turers that I "feel like saying with the old
poet, 'Beatus We gui procul negotiis,'
which I suppose means in English,
'Happy the woman suffragist who can
get a holiday.' "
The faces at the rooms of the Suffrage
leaders in the Parrott building are tired
but happy. Miss Hay says there are so
many things happening to encourage
them that they haven't had the blues for
a week.
They are to have one of the prettiest
booths in the Mechanics' Pavilion. Tha
exhibit will be one of decorated china, the
work done by members of the different
clubs, a convincing proof that the ladies
can do something besides wanting to vote.
The famous lemonade set, which gives a
rather dissipated look to the cozy office,
will of course- be there in all its glory.
Miss Anthony, who can bake the best
bread in Rochester, will put some biscuit
in as her exhibit if she can find time. The
leaders will take turn 3in presiding over
the booth and entertaining visitors. The
booth will be prettily decorated and tha
ladies hope to win the prize lor decorated
china.
At the State Fair in Sacramento the
suffragists have a room. They applied
toe late to be eiven a booth, but the room
will probably do even better, as it can Da
utilized when receptions tre held.

A BLAZE AT
WEAVERVILLE
Gregory's Trial Interrupted
by the Pealing of a
FirebelL
ST. PATRICK'S CHURCH
DESTROYED.
Round Valley and Lone Ridge
Factions Join in Saving
Property.
FEUD OF THE CATTLE ZINGS
FORGOTTEN.
George White and Yes Palmer Bear
ihe Altar From the Burning
Edifice.
WEAVERVILLE, Cal., Aug. 29.â The
trial of Joe Gregory for complicity in the
lynching of "Jack" Littleneld in Round
Valley last September was interrupted to
day by the pealing of the Weaverville
firebelL For two hours court officials, wit
nesses and habitues forgot the Round
Valley feud and battled side by side to
stay a conflagration. When the bell
sounded at 11:20 o'clock, it was discovered
tnat the rectory of St. Patrick's Church
(Roman Catholic) was on fire, and in a
few minutes the cnurch itself was wrapped
in flames. A strong wind was blowing
from the east, and the principal business
blocks of Weaverville were in danger of
destruction. A bucket brigade was hastily
formed, extending from a hydrant to the
church (for a fire engine is an unknown
device in Trinity County), and tin pails,
oil cans and vessels of every description
were pressed into service and passed
rapidly along the line to the fire.
It was the first serious fire that has oc
curred in Weaverville for years, and the
excitement among the residents was in
tense. Men, women and children joined
in the common fight against the conflagra
tion. Along the bucket line could be
seen Chinamen, negroes, white men and
Indians passing the buckets from one to
another, but the remarkable part was the
sight of the Lone Ridgers and the deni
zens of Round Valley standing side by
side, passing the water, along the line
with feverish haste, apparently oblivious
of tne mortal enmity that has existed be
tween them.
Tom Henley passed pails to "Hi" Wil
burn, who gave anything but testimony
palatable to the former a few days ago, and
Buck Lacock, who is out on bail, stood
between two witnesses and urged them to
make all possible haste.
But the grand coup of the day was when
Yes Palmer and George E. White, the
leaders of the two powerful factions now
battling at law over the life or death of
Joe Gregory at Weaverville, rushed into
the burning church and emerged there
from bearing the sacred altar between
them, which they removed to a safe dis
tance beyond the devouring flames. They
were ciosely followed by Alec Perry of
Covelo, a friend of White," with a life-sized
statue of the Savior on bis right shoulder.
Tbe church was built in 1859, and was
considered one of tbe finest edifices in the
northern part of the State at the time of
its construction. Many thousands of dol
lars were contributed toward its erection,
but in those days everything cost dearly
here. Around the church was an old
graveyard, the graves being for the most
part marked by wooden headboards, for
the enormous expense of transporting
granite or marble tombstones by wagon
over the steep summit ol tie Trinity
Mountains, a distance of fifty-six miles
from Redding, the nearest railway town,
would be beyond question except to the
wealthiest. This graveyard was swept by
the flames?, and the boards that identified
the graves destroyed, leaving nothing to
distinguish one mound from another.
The first witness to testify for the de
fense this morning was George E. White,
tbe cattle king, at wnose door a portion of
the conspiracy to kill Sylvester Palmer
and "Jack" Littlefield is laid. Throughout
the brief examination he was non-commit
tal and diplomatic in his replies. It would
have been impossible for his worst enemy
to have taken umbrage at his suave an
swers. Doolittle had told the witness that
Palmer had taken all his cattle, and had
no* taken a mule, and he had replied
he "would not let him take all he had."
He faintly remembered having said some
thing about giving the lawyer a lien on
the muie in preference to "planking up
sound money" for his professional ser
vices. White had inferred from the con
versation with Doolittle that Palmer's
taking of the cattle was quite within the
color and sanction of the law as it was
construed in Round Valley.
Charles Gregory, brother of Joe Greg
ory, next went on the stand. He stated
that he had been at the Vinton cabin on
September 27, with Joe Gregory, Fred
Radcliffe and wife and Peter O'Neill. They
went down to the river to fish that after
noon, and while there saw Bavies Van
Horn, John Crow and "Jack" Littlefield
going up the Wylackie ridge about 5
o'clock in the evening. His testimony
was at variance to that given by Peter
O'Neil and Mrs. Radcliffe, and many of
bis statements as to distance and time
conflicted sadly. The vital point of the"
testimony was the time that Joe Gregory
and Radcliffe liad returned to tbe cabin
that evening, it being of the utmost im
portance to the defense to prove that they
returned home before or at sundown. To
this the witness swore positively, and also
tnat the mule which Radcliffe had ridden
had been shod tw^ days before with
smooth shoes, as was also the horse which
was ridden by Joe Gregory. Its name was
Cachunk, and it belonged to George
White.
George Lichtfoot, uncle of Joe Gregory,
was next sworn. Lightfoot's memory was
obscured and hazy on all points save that
the muie ridden by Fred Radcliffe was
newly shod, and that Peter O'Neill had
held said mule's bead while he was being
shod. O'Neill testified that the mule was
barefooted.
Lawyer Robrbougb, a nephew of John
Rohrbough and also of White, who is a
partner of and manager for George E.
White, was tne next to occupy the wit
ness chair. His examination had just be
gun when the fire bell rang outside the
courthouse, and with one accord witness
and jurors grabbed their hats and made a
rush for the door, the Judge shouting a
parting admotntion to them as their coat
tails disappeared through the threshold.
Court was again called at 2 o'clock, but
as many of tbe jurors were wet from fight
ing fire, and as the Judge had not recov
ered his breath, which be lost while sprint
ing homeward to protect his residence, it
was decided to take a recess until 10 o'clock
Monday morning.

SURROUNDED NEAR DEMING.
Untied States Troops Closing Upon the
Band of Nogales Bank
Robbers.
SILVER CITY, N. Mex., Aug. 29.â Two
companies of United States troops have
again been ordered into the field to assist
Marshal Hall in an attempt to capture the
gang of border bandits, and have been
scouring the plains all night in company
with deputies.
The boldness of tbe bandits is something
remarkable. After escaping from Skele
ton Canyon, where they were supposed
to be surrounded, and passing the
pursuers at Lordsburg, traveling 110
miles undiscovered, the men came
within a few miles of Deming and passed
the nigut with a rancher and in the morn
ing came into town, called at the postof
fice, got mail, and their presence was not
even known by the officers until tney bad
left in a northerly direction, apparently in
the direction of Colorado. There are 150
men In pursuit and a complete circle has
been formed with a radius of twenty
miles. Hall feels confident of making a
capture. The robbers are thought to be
hiding in Cooks Peak Mountains, eighteen
miles north of Deming.
BARKS LIKE A DOG.
A Woman in Stockton's Jail Suffering
From Hydrophobia.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 29.â Laura
Johnson was arrested on a charge of
grand larceny here on Thursday and ac
cused of having robbed a man of $100.
She admitted her guilt and was bound
over to answer before the Superior Court.
This morning, in the county jail, she was
attacked with what seems to be hydro
phobia. She panted like a dog and
whined and barked. The autnorities had
to strap her down. ODiates were admin
istered to soothe her nerves.
This is the second attack of the kind the
woman has suffered. About six months
ago a similar fit lasted several weeks. The
case is a peculiar one and is exciting un
usual interest among the medical profes
sion. The woman ia said to have been
bitten by a dos some years ago. Nothing
was thought of the bite at the time, as the
dog's teeth barely penetrated her flesh.
SAN JOSE'S COUNTY FAIR
Plans Perfected at a Meeting of
Citizens of Santa Clara
Valley.
Assurances of Hearty Support and
Co-operation Received From
Every Section.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 29.â A largely
attended meeting of representatives from
every section of Santa Clara County was
held at the Board of Trade rooms this
afternoon to perfect plans for a county
fair to open on September 28 and continue
one week. Committees have been hard at
work for a n.onth past, and when A. C.
Darby, chairman of the executive commit
tee, opened the meeting to-day and called
for reports of work accomplished the
greatest enthusiasm was displayed, as
from every quarter came assurances of
encouragement and cooperation.
As planned by the Board of Trade, there
is to be an old-time county fair, with ex
hibits in the pavilion of every known
product of the county, and a department
devoted to home manufactures. The fruit
and wine exhibits, from present indica
tions, will eclipse anything of tLe kind
heretofore displayed in this county.
Mrs. Robert Syer, prominent in social
circles here, has been appointed lady man
ager, and next week a meeting of women
from all over the county will be held.
In connection with the fair will be a
stock exhibit, and each day will occur
rousing events under the direction of the
Agricultural Society. Entertainments

SAN JOSE. Cal., Aug. 29.â A meeting
of the Democratic Central Club of Santa
Clara County was held at Turn Verein
Hall in this city this evening. There was
an attendance of about 250. The meeting
was presided over by Leo B. Archer. The
first speaker was W. A. O'Connor of Napa.
He replied to arguments in the recent
speeches of S. M. bhortridge and General
W. H. It. Barnes, and asserted that the
triumph of Bryan and free silver would
mean the upbuilding of American manu
factures and commerce and ruination of
England, as far as securing any market for
her products in the United States and
South America was concerned. The meet
ing was closed with a speech by N. T.
Biddle, who predicted that with the union
of Democracy and Populism the triumph
of Bryan and free silver was assured.
There was an addition of twenty-five
names to the club roll, making a total

Of late a great deal of fast riding has
been indulged in by bicyclists and drivers
of vehicles, and many serious accidents
have happened. The arrests to-day are
the first in a crusade inaugurated aeainst

OREGON HERMIT
SEEKS A CHILD.
Laden With Riches, George
Farnwell Returns to
Civilization.
LIVED WITH INDIANS.
Ledges Streaked With Gold Re
vealed to Him by the
Redskins.
COMING TO SAN FRANCISCO.
Bears a Sack of Yellow Metal for a
Wedding Present to His Grand
daughter.
PORTLAND. Or., Aug. 29.â George 8.
Farnwell, the Southern Oregon hermit,
75 years old, passed through here for Ban
Francisco last night, after an absence of 40
veats. During that period he eschewed
the society of his fellowman as much as
possible, never venturing into populated
sections of Southern Oregon except when
he needed supplies, and that was not more
than twice a year. He located in the
wilds some miles distant from Grants
Pass nearly thirty -five years ago, and it is
doubtful whether five score of people in
that section of the country are aware of
his existence.
When Farnwell first located there the
country swarmed with Indians and wild
beasts. The Indians once made him cap
tive, but they soon came to regard him as
supernatural being, and he was released.
For the first time in almost a generation
Farnwell broke his reticence while waiting
for the departure of the train that was to
carry him to the scenes that knew him
when he was young.
"After I had been with the Indians a few
months, they driving me to all kinds of
servile work," said the old man, "scarlet
fever broke out among a dozen of their
papooses. As early as that time I packed
a chest of homeopathic medicines with
me. When the Indians captured me they
relieved me of my medicines, as well as
all cisc I had. but because of some super
stition they left my medicine chest intact.
When the disease broke out among the
little ones and four of them died under
aboriginal treatment I volunteered to cure
the rest if mry dox of mystery was re
turned to me. The Indians feared to trust
me at the outset, but after a consultation,
during which anotner papoose died, my
request was acceded to.
"In the meantime ten more little In
dians were attacked by the scourge, and I
quarantined all of tbe sick. My medicines
worked miracles, and under my treatment
not a person died. 1 was looked upon as
a great medirine man, and after that my
former masters became my servants.
"Through those Indians I was enabled
to locate a very rich mining property, of
which to this day no white man but my
self knows anything. I have 1000 pounds
of mixed gold stored away in a place
where no one will discover it. In yonder
little chest I have 100 pounds of the
metal, which I am taking to the San Fran
cisco mint. I mined merely to keep my
self occupied until death clafmed me, for
I never expected to associate with tcy
kind again."
Farnwell said that the only circum
stances tending to change his mind was a
brief notice of an ensuing marriage of one
of his granddaughters, which he saw in a
San Francisco paper a week ago. Not
once in five years did he glance at a news
paper and to him it seemed providential
that ne should have seen this one.
"It appears to me to be a command from
the Almighty," said the old man, "that I
must again mingle with my own flesh and
blood. The article stated that the young
lady's grandfather had been receiving tel
ler with Page, Bacon & Co. in San Fran
cisco up to within a few months of the
failure of the house during the panic of
1856. I being the man, I resolved to fix
my son's girl so she wouldn't want for
anything the heart desires in this life.
That is why I am going to San Fran
cisco."
COLORADO DESERT STORM
Traffic on the Santa Fe Delayed
by a Downpour of
Rain.
Wasbou's Are Reported and the Over
land Train Is Held at Los
Angeles.
Lob Angeles Office of The Call,)
328 South Broadway, V
Los Angeles, Cal., Aug. 29. J
The weather has been extremely saltry
throughout Southern California to-day.
Dark, heavy clouds have hung about the
mountain crests all day and rain has
fallen in many spots. This seems to have
been a sequel to one of the heaviest storms
ever known on the desert side of the
mountains. Up to 6 o'clock this morning
rain had fallen constantly all the way
from Victor, on the line of the Santa Fe
Railroad, to the CoHrado River for a
period of more than twelve hours. Wash
outs are reported along the Santa Fe Rail
road at many desert stations. Owing to
these breaks in the track tne overland
train, due to leave here this morning, has
been held here until the road can be re
paired. How long this will take it is im
possible to tell, since at last accounts rain
was still falling in torrents at many places
on its line.
This being the rainy season on the desert
the chances are that more or less damage
has also been sustained by the Santa Fe
in New Mexico. Rainstorms are reported
along the Yuma division of the Southern
Pacific, but no serious* damage had oc
curred up to 5 o'clock this afternoon.
JVrtc Scale of Wages.
LOS ANGELE, Cal., Aug. 29. â The
new settle of wages that has been
agreed upon by the Carpenters' Union and
the building contractors, representing at
least 90 per cent of the work being done in
the city, goes into effect on Monday. This
agreement is $3 per day for eight hours'
work for all journeymen carpenters.
Exterminating tiering Sea Seals.
SEATTLE. Wash., Aug. 29.â T0-day's
Alaska advices say that the Government
commission, headed by Dr. David Starr
Jordan, created for the purpose of inquir
ing into the status of tbe seal industry,
has discovered that the herds have dimin
ished in size and numbers to an insignifi
cant fraction of their former vast number;
that it is extremely improbable that the
company having a contract for taking
30,000 skins annually will be able to secure
that many this season, even in the face of
the fact that the ace restriction as to bulls
has been reduced one year. The Albatross,
which vessel carried the commission from
this port, in continuance of her mission
is reported to have sailed to the Japan
coast.
ROMANCE OF SA N DIEGO.
loung Sweethearts Overcome Paternal
Objection* by Wedding at Sea.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 29.â Scott
Palmer, son of J. D. Palmer, the house
mover, wanted to get married the other
day and applied to bis father for per
mission. Scott is only 19, but big for his
age, and with a pretty large amount of
self-reliance. The father refused, saying
that the boy should wait until at least 21
years ole* before entering into the responsi
bilities of married life.
Tbe boy was not pleased with the reply.
He was ready right then to enter upon
any responsibility connected with matri
mony. He did not say anything to his
father, but consulted a good deal with the
girlâ Miss May Kendall, 17, and pretty.
She was disposed to postpone the matter
when she learned of the old man's de
cision, but young Palmer wouldn't have
it, and then he broached, with a great deal
of diplomacy, the propositi' n to go to sea
and get married. To this the girl de
murred.
She had not been to sea much and she
might get sick. Then she was not sure it
was a legal marriage, and she didn't want
any other kind. The publicity and every
thing else caused her to hesitate.
When Scott saw her hesitate he knew
he hart won. He urged, implored, begged
and explained until finally the girl con
sented. Captain George Chase, the urbane
skipper of the junk Acme, was the man
who tied the knot. On Thursday morning
he engaged tne launch Urania, Captain
Panlsen, to go out on a fishing cruise.
Captain Chase got his wife and hurried
aboard. Young Palmer and Miss Kendall
appeared by appointment, and all em
barked for the high seas, where the skip
per's word is law, be he ever so hum b)e.
There, with the rolling waves and sea
birds' cry for music, the young couple
made their vows. Captain Chase tied a
true love knot, and no matter how mad
the parents become the tie will bind.

FIGHT FOR CONTENTS.
Directors of the Jlatleson- Williamson
Company at Loggerheads.
, STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 29.â There was
excitement in the works of the Matteson-
Williamson Manufacturing Company this
morning, when one faction of the board
of directors seized the works and office on
Main street and prevented those who had
been in control from entering. - v ;i^
There has been trouble brewing in the
directorate of the company for some time.
It culminated several I days ago ., when the
faction headed by H. E. Williamson, who
has . been managing' the concern, made a
motion at one of the directors' meetings;
to oast Don Mattuson from ; the : presi
dency. Matteson refused to entertain the
motion and declared the meeting ad

FUSION FAILS

a Candidate for
Congress.
CUTLER OF HUMBOLDT.
A Harmonious Gathering, Where
Proxies Outnumber the
Delegates.
BITTER WOEDS FOR MONTEITH.
The Populist Nominee Denounced Be
cause He Wou d Not
Withdraw.
NAPA, Cal., Aug. 29.â Fletcher A. Cut
lei of Humboldt County was to-day nom
inated for Congress by the Democratic
party of the First Congressional District.
The District Convention met at 11:30
o'clock to-day at me Napa Opera-house,
pursuant to adjournment taken here two
weeks ago. In numbers and enthusiasm
the gathering differed little from that of
August 15, when Mr. Geary appeared with
his pockets full of proxies. The dele
gates were not so numerous but that they
could be readily counted, and on the
countenance of each perplexity rather
than pleasure was written.
J. C. Ruddock of Ukiah called the meet
ing to order, stated its objects and asked
for the delegates' further pleasure. On
motion the chair appointed the following
committee on credentials: Saunders,
Martin, Lane of Mendocino; Harris of
Napa; Wells of Tebama. The following
committee on resolutions was also ap
pointed: Wilklns of Napa, Duhriug of
Sonoma, Sellers of Humboldt, Wilkins of
Marin, Braynard of Shasta, Andrews of
Tehama and Taylor of Shasta. Recess
was then taken until 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon.
On reassembling, the committee on cre
dentials reported forty-five proxies and a
less number of delegates present. Ex-
Congressman Geary reported for the com
mittee on fusion appointed at the first
meeting. Its mission had been embar
rassed by the position of Monteith, the
Populist nominee, who refused to accept
the decision of the committee of fifteen â
six Democrats, six Populists and three
Silveritesâ unless the decision was in his
favor. Geary then proceeded to warm the
Monteith personality with a speech full of
bitterness and strong language, and moved
that the convention proceed to nominate
a straight-out Democrat, who would agree
to submit his resignation to the commit
tee, which meets in San Francisco next
Monday, and be willing to accept what
ever might be done.
After the reading of the resolutions,
nominations were declared in order.
Sellers of Humboldt presented the name
of, Fletcher A. Cutler of Humboldt. The
nomination was seconded by Ruddock,
chairman of the committee. In a neat
speech, T. J. Geary of Santa Rosa placed
Henry Hogan of Napa in nomination.
Hogan has been one of the foremost Demo
crats of Napa County, and his name was
received with much applause. The nomi
nation was seconded by B. S. Wilkins of
Napa. Hogan would not allow his name
to go before the convention, and so Cutler
was chosen by acclamation.
Cutler, in accepting the nomination,
pledged himself to do all in his power to
advance the Democratic party and Demo
cratic interests.
PERKINS AT PETALUMA.
A Republican Gathering Addressed by
the Senator.
PETALUMA, Cal., Aug. 29.â Petaluma
awoke from its political apathy, when
this evening, under the auspices of the
McKinley Club, Hon. George C. Perkins
and S. J. Duckworth spoke before a large
and enthusiastic audience. Many ladies
were present, members of the Women's
Suffrage Club turning out in force. The
local theater was tastefully and profusely
decorated, the club members being as
sisted therein by ladies who would vote
for McKinley could they only be recog
nized as being superior to idiots and
Indians.
After appropriate National airs by the
band, Lynian Green opened the meeting.
The vice-presidents were: Colonel Fair
bunks, Messrs. M. Walsh, W. H. Darden,
William Hartman, W. B. Haskel, H, L.

R. Winanans, J. McNear, G. B. Lewis, H.
Mecham, A. Neuoerger, L. Tomasini, J.
B. Hinkle, J. L. Dinwiudte.
Chairman Dinwiddie made a few appro
priate remarts in a fervent Republican
spirit, and greatly in favor of woman iui
frage, ending with a graceful introduction
to the audience of Senator Perkins, who
for some minutes, owing to tne noisy dem
onstrations, was unable to proceed. Fi
nally, the enthusiasm subsiding, he
opened his speech with words in praise of
jfetalurna, being frequently interrupted by
applause, especially when the names of
McKinley and Hobart were mentioned.
The Senator spoke of the unswerving at
titude of the Republican party that was
born with its first President, Abraham
Lincoln. Never, he declared, had it been
unfaithful or untrue to any promises made
to the people. He held up the fallacious
views of the Democrats "and showed the
weak points in their platform, in striking
contrast to tne stability of the Republican
policy. The Senator's discourse was in
terspersed with many fitting anecdotes,
all brought to bear upon the subject, and
alter holding his audience for almost two
hours, he retired amidst much applsnse to
mate way for the next speaker. Ex-As
semblyman S. J. Duckworth of Monterey
was introduced by J. L. Dinwiddie, and
madeateilingand eloquent speech, and the
meeting broke up with "threo times three"
for McKinley, protection and prosperity.
RALLY AT F ISALIA.

VIBALIA, Cal.. Aug. .29.â McKinley
and sound money met with a glorious re
ception in Visalia to-night. Despite the
rain a great crowd turned out. Tulare's
McKinley Club came over on a special
train with a band. Judge W. A. Gray in
troduced William Ratcliffe of Tulare as
chairman.
Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn was the first
speaker. Her eloquent appeal to voters to
remember the first plank in the Republi
can platform for the enfranchisement of
women was warmly applauded. Colonel
John P. Jackson spoke on the financial
question.
SALENAS McKINLEY CLUB.
Populists and Democrat* Attracted to
the Party of Protection.
SALINAS, Cal., Aug. 29.â The Salinas
McKinley Club held its regular weekly
meeting last night, and made a '.'ladies'
night" of it. The hall was well filled,
fully one-half of the audience being ladies.
The club now consisted of 220 members,
and McKinley enthusiasm is growing
daiiy.
Q. A. Daugherty presided over the meet
ing and speeches were made by Hon. W.
J. Hill, G". A. Daugherty, Mrs. J. Winston
and Mrs. H. L. Bradford. The latter two
dwelt particularly upon the woman's
suffraee plank of the platform.
McKinley's letter of acceptance is uni
versally regarded among the Republicans
here as the ablest production of the cam
paign. Many Populists and Democrats
in different portions of the county have
expressed their intention of voting for
"protection and sound money," and Re
publican prospects are brightening daily.
STO CKTON'S McKINLEY CLOD.

county was organized to-night, when 300
Republicans gathered at the headquarters
on Hunter street, between Main and Mar
ket, and perfected a temporary organiza
tion under the name of the McKinley and
Hobart club. George W. Campbell, a rad
ical gold-standard man, was selected as
chairman, and Joseph Cavis, the post
master here under the Republican admin
istration, as secretary. Addresses were
delivered by Assemblyman E. I. Jones,
Arthur H. Ashley, George W. Campbell,
W. Thomas, H. G. Shaw and Josept)
Davis. The club will meet on September
12 ior permanent organization an< i will
then elect permanent officers.
There was more genuine enthusiasm
manifested at to-night's meeting than in
any other in the history of political organ
izations in this county. So quietly was
the meeting called that many did not
know of it, and but for this reason there
would have been fully 500 in attendance
to-night. While the Democrats were
making all the noise on the plaza the Re
publicans were organizing so quietly two
blocks away that no one outside knew of
the meeting.
A determination to win in this section
seemed to dominate all the acts of those
who conducted the meeting to-night.

offered by E. & Van Meter to indorse the

sorts of improper motives for taking the
stand he did. An insinuation by G. P.

aiding the cause ot gold by methods nn
worthy of an honest man, was vehemently
taken up by Dore. When put to a vote,

PORTLAND, Or., Aug. 29.-An im
mense forest lire, the fiercest that has ever
raged on the banks of the Columbia River,
is now in progress between Oak Point and
Eagle Cliff. Back on the bluff, stretching
away from the river, is a seething furnace,
comprising four square miles of once mag
nificent forest. A miie away, at the
steamboat landing at Oak Point, may be
heard the detonations caused by the rend
ing of giant firs and spruce, bursting
through the explosions of steam rendered
from their own sap. High above the tree
tops soars a vast belt of flame, drifting up
ward from the fierce blaze beneath. Down
on the bosom of the river rests a pall of
smoke so dense as to cause navigation of
the Columbia at points near the tire to be
dangerous, it being impossible to see a
boat's length ahead, even did not the
stineiug pitch fumes from the burning
timber blind the pilots of the steamers.
Captain Dell Shaver and Pilot F. G. Lewis
of the steamer George W. Shaver said to a
Call representative to-xlay: Â»
"It is beyonu a doubt the largest fire
that has ever swept the banks of the Co
lumbia. How it started is mere conjec
ture, although to our certain knowledge
there has been a small fire burning to the
west of the present blaze for the past three
weeks. This has probably been fanned
into a larger blaze by the circling eddy of
the land breeze, which gathers each night
in the canyon back of Oak Point, and
aided by the draft caused by its own heat
has been drawn into the adjoining timber.
This timber, owing to the long dry spell
of July and August, has become as dry as
matchwood, and it required but a spark to
set the forest in a blaze. With the first
jump of the fire from the underbrush to
the timber the flames took hold of the
dry bouehs and simply galloped through
the woods."
So rapid was the progress of the fire that
people in its path had only time to es
cape in the clothes they .were wearing,
leaving all other possessions behind. Ben
son's large loeging camp, -with Its tram
way, cars, locomotives and cut logs, was
swept olean by the flames. Hogan &
Young's cordwood camp, with 1200 cords
of wood ready for market, has gone up in
smoke. The Davidson family fought its
way through to the river bank and boarded
the Shaver, leaving behind them to burn a
$2000 house, barn and fences, a harvested
crop and all their personal effects, some of
the men escaping without even a coat.
From the pilot-house of the Shaver the
flames could be seen mounting skyward,
and the roar of the fire be heard miles
away before the steamer reached Oak
Point,
Gradually the smoKe berame thicker on
the river as the steamer approached the
landing until when within a mile of* the
point the atmosphere was so dense as to
vrove almost suffocating. From where
the Shaver tied up the fire seemed distant
about three-quarters of a mile back in the
timber. Whether lives have been lost or
not it will take some time to determine,
but among the passengers taken aboard at
Oak Point last night was a woman, who
was greatly perturbed over the possible
fate of her sister, who lived a mile further
back in the timber than she, and inas
much as the passenger had all she could
do to make her way out it was greatly
feared her sister had been caught by the
onward rush of tne tire and burned to
death.
SPHEAD OF THE FLAMES.
Million* of Feet of Timber Itestroyed
Around Oak Point.
ASTORIA, Ob., Aug. 29.â Foiest fire 3
are still raging in the vicinity of Oak
Point, about forty miles above this city,
on the Washington side. Thousands of
dollars' worth of the finest fir timber has
been destroyed, together with the big log
sing outfit of the Benson Lumber Com
pany. Already the flames have spread
over an area of nearly twenty square
miles, and consumed everything in their
path. Up to to-night the buildings of
Le Roy Davidson were the only others
destroyed since the destruction of the
Benson place. The latter contained the
larcest logging plant on the river, and
comprised locomotives, donkey engines
and other labor-saving appliances.
The wind Is now in the southwest and
Oak Point, which was threatened last
niirht, is safe unless the wind again
changes. None of the canneries are con
sidered in any danger, although fears were
entertained last night that the establish
ments of William Hume and the Eureka
Packing Company might be destroyed.
It is estimated that every square mile of
land devastated contained over 30,000,000
feet of timber, entailing a loss of at least
$250,000. To-night the fire is well back in
the timber and burning fiercely adjacent
to the Weibt logging camp, which.? is in
danger. All the timber in the vicinity of
the camp is destroyed, and it is impossible
to state where the conflagration will end,
unless rain falls very soon.
GOSPEL WORK IN SANT A CRUZ.
luiptittt Preach From Wagon* on the,
Streets of the Cittf.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Aut?. 29.â Not con
tent with earlj morning services, the Bap
tists who are in convention at Twin Lakes
varied the special devotional exercises to
day with a street campaign in Santa Cruz,
holding services in two gospel wagons
that attracted general attention. The con
vention adopted a resolution fÂ«voring and
promising; to work for the constitutional
amendment granting the elective fran
chise to women.
This morning's session was devoted
principally to Bunday-school work. Rev.
J. George Gibson of Ernanuel Baptist
Church, San Francisco, delivered an nd
dress on "Sunday-school Music." Rev. G.
W. Smith of Stockton followed with an ad
dress on "The Elements of Success in the
Sunday-school," and the session closed
with a normal lesson conducted by D. 1\
Ward, the Baptist Sunday-school mission
ary for Caliiornia.
The pertinent questions pat by Mr.
Ward prevented any disposition of drowsi
ness that might have been occasioned by
the constant work of the convention. Rev.
M. P. Boyuton of San Francisco and T. B.
Hughes of Napa gave short addresses and
discussions by several Sunday-school
teachers Joilowed.
A business session of the Young Peo
ple's convention occupied the afternoon.
It was held at the First Baptist Church in
Santa Cruz. At night a rousing meeting
of young folks was held. Rev. A. B.
Banks of Sacramento, called the "silver
tongued orator of the Pacific Coast Bap
tists," delivered an eloauent address on
the history of the "Young People's meet
ings. Tha ministers say the youngsters
of the Baptist denomination pride them
selves upon showing their eiders how to
work.
AFFRAY AT GRELTON.
Three Men Engage in a Moody Encounter
Over a Woman.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 29.â News has
reached here of a bloody fight that oc
curred Thursday night at Shelton, a log
ging town thirty miles west of here. John
Murray and his brother, loggers, had
trouble with Douglas Sholton, a surveyor
and a member of the family which founded
the town, over a young woman "who at
tended a dance with Shelton and whom
Murray brothers are said to have insulted.
The next morning the three met in Webb
Hotel and the altercation was renewed.
One of the Marrays strucK Bhelton and
the latter drew a revolver and fired two
shots at the Murray brothers, narrowly
missing both of them. One of the Murray
boys ran from the hotel lobby into the
barroom and jumped through a plate irlass
window to the street and the other
knocked Shelton down with his fist, took
his pistol away from him and beat his
face until it was almost unrecognizable.
The three were arrested. The Murray
boys were bound over for six months to
keep the peace. Shelton was held in the
sum ot $100 to appear before the Superior
Court on a charge of assault with a deadly
weapon. ________________
DANCE AT GLEN ELLEN
Guests of Camp O'Ryan Well
Entertained by the
Cadets.
Pleasant Finale to the Onting Under
the Trees of Picturesque
Sonoma.
GLEN ELLEN, Cal.. Aug. 29.â The last
day of the week in Camp O'Ryan, where
the League of the Cross Cadets have been
gathered, has been a fitting finale for one
of the pieasantest outings of the year. A
morning of pleasurable anticipations, of
bustling and preparing for visitors who
were to flock in from the City, a day of fun
combined with arranging details for the
farewell ball, and an evening of sweet re
grets.
The young ladies of Glen Ellen who
have been captivated by the manly, clever
cadets participated largely in the events of
the day, and no doubt, if their story were
told, they joined the young soldiers of the
cross in regrets that a very enjoyable and
altogether novel week in their lives had
come to a close.
Great camp fires blazed, throwing their
rays and shafts of light upon the deco
rated tents. The camp field fell com
pletely under their influence and over all,
cadets, ladies and visitors alike there was
a subtle spell in the glorious night. At
the large pavilion lamps of all kinds were
burning brilliantly upon a scene of danc
ing couples, young warriors in field uni
forms with clanking sabers and the ever
popular ladies in light colored summer
costumes. There the cadets were in their
element, acting as gallants and otherwise
contributing to the entertainment of their
guests with a melange of songsâsenti
mental, comic and otherwise â recitations,
drum calls, glees and character sketches,
and so it waa lateâ long after the accus
tomed hour for taps â that the cadets were
called in and the grand bail was at an
end.
The guests declared the cadets were ex
cellent entertainers, and felt soiry that
they could not remain with them in this
beautiful country for a much longer time.
The grand ball was managed by the fol
lowing officers and members of the regi
ment.

There was considerable trouble in camp
early this morning, caused by the dreaded
"Pirates" and their companions. The re
sult was that James Nugent, John Fagan,
Andrew Hynes, Jere Sullivan, W. McDer
mott, J. Guinea and F. Guinea of Com :
pany H were placed under arrest and com
pelled to work at cleaning the camp, as
prisoners, for three hours, under a heavy
guard commanded by Sergeant Crowley.
They did so well with the camp that they
won the sympathy of Father Yorke, who
treated them to & feast of Icecream.
Corporal of the Guard John Whelan,
Company H, fell asleep while on duty,
and his guards â Tim Dwyer of C and P.
Donovan of Hâ went to their tents and
slept, so Camp O'Ryah was wholly at the
mercy of the mid^igfit prowlers. Fortun
ately it escaped, though there was no one
to change at 6 A. M.
Father O'Ryan added to his popularity
with the cadets this morning when he
purchased a large load of watermelons for
them. He proposed to diride the melons
equally among the tents, but it became a
grand scramble at the wagon, which caused
so much fun that Father O'Ryan let the
boys divide the coveted melons to please
themselves.
A choir was organized yesterday to sing
at the military mass to-morrow. It is
composed of Lieutenant Kennedy of the
staff. Charles Canning, Lieutenant Dave
Barry, John O'Brien, Charles dv FosÂ»ee,
Robert Canning and .Harry Smith of Com
pany C, and John Keating, William Kelly
and WiJliam Ryan of Company H. Miss
Stevens of the cathedral choir will lead
the boys with Lieutenant Kennedy. Ap
propriate hymns, the "Te Deura," and in
conclusion, "America" will be sung dur
ing the mass.
Mr. and Mrs. Julius Wegener enter
tained the visiting priests and cadet offi
cers at dinner to-day at their villa, near
this place. The guests were given a pleas

with game and fresh fruits, added to its
toothsomeness. Those present were-

"WOODLAND} Cal., Aug. 29.â The pro
gramme for the closing day of the race
meeting embraced live events. There was
a good attendance, ana the speed events
were as hotly contested as any during the
meeting. The 2:15 trot was a battle from
the time the horses faced the starter until
tbe game Gazelle finished first under the
wire in the fourth heat. It was evident
that the Palo Alto mare, Helena, was
feared by tbe others, for she was driven
out In 2:12% in the first heat,' with Gazelle
a close second. Gazelle took the next
three heats, but was compelled to fieht
every inch of the way, for she was close
pressed by the other fliers. The third
heat was trotted in 2:11%, lowering the
track trotting record one second. Helena
was favorite in the pools. 'V^-
In the match race between Cinnabar and
Merle M for $200, best two in three, the
former won, taking the' first and third
heats. * .
. It was decided to sandwich a pacing
beat between the heats in the trot, and the
horses in the 2:15 class were called. Al
j Gregor sold against the field at odds of $10
| to $5. Colonel Benton led to the upper turn.
; The favorite was in fourth place, but passed
Nutwood and Our Boy in the back

he pleased. Time, 2:11%. He took the
second and third heats easily. .
In the seven-furlong. running race there
were seven starters. Peixotto sold favor

! hot finish won from Peixotto by half a
I length.
.In the eleven-sixteenths of a mile tun
ning race Sea Spray sold for $10, Lost Girl
$10 and the field $11. Lost Girl fell
and threw her rider (Maxey) at the post.

Look at that man, if he may be called such.
He is nervous, fretful, irritable. He is bilious, melancholy,
liver torpid, circulation sluggish, digestion bad and appetite
poor. He feels run down, is easily made tired, and has frequent <
headaches. ' . /
| THAT IS WHAT HE TALKS ABOUT.
And he has troubles of a different nature. He has loss of
pleasure in '; : the performance rof certain natural functions ; loss
of vitality and manly vigor ; loss of desire, feeble power, prema-
ture discharge and so fofth.
THAT IS WHAT HE DOES NOT TALK ABOUT,
Not even to his family physician. He goes to him with the
first set of symptoms and gets temporary relief, but the latter set,
, __Â£ _ _-.: from which the former often
jtfjsp^M^^ arise, he keeps to himself. He

; But there is yet help for you, and a perfect cure, too, if you
will ? promptly secure the services of the learned specialist,
Doctor Cook, who can tell you more about your exact condition
at one consultation than an ordinary physician can after many
weeks of fruitless treatment. He will make out of you a man,
with a man's pride, a man's power, a man's privileges.;
Doctor Cook not only restores Lost Manhood . and removes
every symptom of it from young, middle-aged and old men, but
he cures Gonorrhoea, Gleet, Stricture, Syphilis, Varicocele, j Hy-
drocele and all other. signs of sexual debility, deformity or decay.
Careful attention gives to every form of female complaint,
and to ailments of the Heart, Lungs, , Liver, Stomach, Kidneys,
Bladder and Urinary Organs of both sexes. ; Piles, Fistula,
Rupture and Chronic Catarrh come within his specialty.
Doctor "Cook â ; particularly desires ; chronic, obstinate, deep,
seated diseases that have baffled the skill of other physicians
and resisted their treatment. i His thoughts are continuously,
with stubborn cases and their remedies. â 
Doctor Cook has developed a: ; system of home treatment by
correspondence ; that is absolutely perfect and always satisfactory.
Therefore if you live out of the 'city and cannot come to the
doctor's office write him. Describe your troubles freely and
without reserve, in your own way, and be assured that your
letter will be carefully concealed from curious eyes. v .-.Office ! hours

f SAN FRANCISCO, CAL.
Columbia Pistol and Rifle Company of
San Francisco hp.s flaunted a challenge
free to any military company in the worJd,
which, though standing these three or
four years, has never been accepted. The
Columbias are excellent sports, gathered
from military ranks and private clubs,
and seem to rate hi?h. Company D had.
a year ago, a^ team that would not have
feared to try them, and now they will
make an effort to get back to their old
excellence, and go forth to meet this de
fiant Goliah. If the match is made it
will be with military rifles, 200 yards, ana
no little interest will attach to it.

Representatives From the
Bay Counties in Semi-
Annual Session.
ENCOURAGING REPORTS.
Interest in the Order Being Re
newed in the Districts
Represented.
"OUR HOPL" WON THE BANNER.
A Yourjg San Francisco Lodge Show A d
the Greatest Increase in Mem
bership.
The semi-annuni convention of the fifth
district, Independent Order of Good Tem
plars, which was held in Pythian Hall
yesterday, was one of the most satisfactory
which the district has known for many
years. The officials of the order, who
have been prominent in temperance work
tor many years, expressed themselves as
elated with the showing which the dele
gates made and the enthusiasm evinced in
the work.
The district represented in convention
yesterday is but one of the nine districts of
the State. It, however, comprises the bay
counties, and is the most numerous in
membership. The order in California at
present numbers between 5000 and 6000
members. In 1886 the membership in the
State was between 18,000 and 19,000, but at
that time the order was carrying on the
temperance work almost single-handed.
Since then the Women's Christian Tem
perance Union has been organized and the
churches have commenced temperance
work in their own organizations. This
has seriously affected the membership of )
the order, but it remains an active and j
flourishing fraternity. An important fea
ture of the order is its juvenile branches,
the Band of Hope and Juvenile Temples,
which have now a membership of about
3500 in the State.
The forenoon's session was devoted to
routine work and organization, A. H. j
Finkleman presiding in the absence of j
District Chief Charles Winchell. At 12
o'clock the delegate" partook of a collation
which had been prepared by the local sub
ordinate lodge. Informal speeches were
made by many prominent members of the
order.
In the afternoon District Deputy Charles
\Vinclieil of Vallejo presided. District
Superintendent of Juvenile Work Mrs. S.
Kerriean rendered her report, which was
full of encouragement. It showed over
1000 members of temples and bands of
Hope in the district.
The finance committee reported that all
bills had been paid and there was a bal
ance in the treasury. It was reported that

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 30, 1896.
SHE BROUGHT TWO WAIFS
Miss Elizabeth Nyup and Her
Interesting Charges From
China.
The Work of a Danish Missionary
Among the Children cf the
Foreign Poor.
Among the arrivals on the steamer Rio
de Janeiro yesterday was Miss Elizabeth
Nyup, a Danish missionary who has been
working among the poor people in the in
terior of China.
The self-sacrificing lady has toiled for j
eight years there, and has established a |
school for blind children and waifs gener
ally. In this school, which is a sort of j
kindergarten in some ways, she teaches
the blind to read and write as well as the
others and instructs all the children in
sewing, knitting and other work.
What has attracted attention to the
missionary now, however, are two little
waifs, which accompany her, and which
she will take with her 10 her native land.
One of these is a little English child 1%
years old, wl ose parents died and left it
in want, and thÂ« other is only 1% years
old, a child of Chinese and Jewish parents.
These children are to receive a complete
education abroad, or at least as complete
as Miss Nyup is able to secure for them.
After her long years in China she will
have a vacation for several months
at least. On leaving the ship sne
went to the home of friends in Oakland,
taking the two little waifs with her. They
are Dright children.
RELAY PACKET
WAS CAPTURED.
Couriers Intercepted Ten
Miles This Side of #
Ogden.
RESTORED AT ECHO.
Riders Did Not Pass Through
Either SaJt Lake or
Ogden.
SP3ED OVER THE WAHSATCH
Granger, Wyo., Passed at 10:24
o'Clock Last Nightâ Due at Ravf.
lins This Afternoon.
The great bicycle relay of the San Fran
cisco Examiner and New York Journal
caused intense public excitement at Ogden
and Salt Lake yesterday morning. The
relay riders were expected to arrive at an
early hour, but the throngs assembled to
give an ovation were soon disturbed by
rumors that the couriers bearing the
packet had been intercepted and over
powered west of Ogden.
Conflicting accounts come by wire from
the scene. A special dispatch to The Call
gives this version :
SALT LAKE, U TAHi Aug. 29.â Heavy rains
in the desert west ot this city necessitated a
change in the route of the transcontinental
bicycle race, go that the package was brought
vih O?den instead of direct to Salt Lake. At
Terrace, Utah, a dispute arose between the
Salt Lake and Ogden riders for the possession
of the package, and a lively but harmless gun
play was indulged fn, with the result that the
Ogden men got the package.
Fowler carried it to Grovv's ranch. From
there it was conveyed to Kelton by Harris who
punctured his tire and finished the distance
on foot. Rev. Mr. Snow brought it to Willard,
whence Hulmston took it to Ogden, arriving
there at 6:24 this morning. From Ogden it
was taken directly east without touching at
Balt Lake by the Ogden riders contrary to
agreement and reached Echo at 11:2*2 a.m.,
ahead of time. From Echo, Hart and Shipley
of Salt Lake bore It on cast. The picket ar
rived at Wahoatch at 1 :34 P. M., at Piedmont,
Wyo., at 4:45 P. M,, and at Carter, Wyo., at
6 :40 P. M.
Granger, Wyo., 944 miles from San Fran-
Cisco, was reached at 10:24 to-night, the actual
riding time being four days nine hours and
twenty-four minutes, one hour being gained
through the change from Pacific to mountain
standard time. The couriers are now about
one hour ahead of schedule time.
The following telegrams received by the
Examiner give another version of the
divergence, and indicate that neither Salt
Lake nor Ogden got a sight of the packet :
OGDEN, Aug. 29.â Change of route was put
up job ana neatly executed. Ogden Standard
hinted at-it this evening.
SALT LAKE, Aug. 29.â Ahorseback rider has
rust reported at Ogden that this evening about
7 o'clock he saw two bicyclists riding through
Echo Canyon, headed for Echo, Utah.
OGDEN, Utah, Aug. 29.â The Ogden Stan
dard this morning said: That programme will
be carried out if no accklent befall, and in case
the rider bringing the packet into Ogden does
not get on the wrong road.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Aug. 29.â War message
was scheduled to arrive here at 7 o'clock this
morning. Last heard of ten miles west of Og
den at 5:45. Ogden has no news and courier
cannot he iound. Wildest excitement here..
OGDEN, Aug. 29.â Jack Ledwidge, who had
charge of relay between Terrace and Corinne,
admits that the relay had gone through to
Echo, and says the packet will save five hours
thereby. He'disclaims personal knowledge of
plot, but says he is proud of Oeden couriers.
OGDEN, Aug. 29.â Relay is not reported
from Echo. Changed at Corinne, thirty miles
west of here at 6 :30 a. m. Afterward seen in
Ogden Canyon. Prople are crazy over their
success in fooiing Salt Lake.
â  OGDEN. Utah, Aug. 29.â The packet has
been kidnaped after all. Ogden boys did it
this time. They sneaked through Ogden
Canyon in the night, thus avoiding both Og
den and Salt Lake for the sake of humiliating
the State capital.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Aug. 29.â Owing to bit
ter riyalry between Balt Lake and Ogden,
wheelmen have probably caused the Ogden
riders to change the route, leaving out Salt
Lake City, Excited crowds here.
OGDEN, Aug. 29.â Public demonstration
here against Reshel, who oears himself like
a lion. Hoodlums tie crepe to his bicycle, but
he laughs them to scorn.
OGDEN, Aug. 29.â Reshel, the giant Salt
Lake manager, is cast down but not destroyed.
He is loyal to the relay, and will pull it
through his division. He is jumping a freight
car East for that purpose.
OGDEN, Aug. 29.â Relay is repotted from
Echo. Tne men rode through the now noted
Ogden Canyon, crossing the divide into Weber
Canyon at Mountain Green at dead of night.
Another special from Salt Lake says:
After all the Ogden riders did not come up
to Salt Lake schedule by over four hours, in
stead of beating it as they hoped. They did
not reach Echo till 11:05, making 17 hours
and 5 minutes from Terrace. Original desert
route from Terrace to Echo through SaSt Lake
called lor 13 hours and 2 minutes.
The relay riders arrived at Blue Creek at
1:06 A. M. yesterday; Hot Springs at 5:02 a. M.;
Peterson, Utah. 9 :07 a. m. ; Echo, 11 :05 a. m. ;
Castle Rock, 12:51 p. m. ; Wnhsatch, 1:34 p. m.
Ned Hewett made a wonderful uphill ride
from Castle Hock to Wahsateh, the peak of the
mountains, in forty-three minutes, beating his
schedule time ten minutes.
Evanston was reached at 2:06 p. m. Gullibar
did the eleven miles in thirty-one minutes,
tiie fastest time yet made. Herritt trailed
him all the way, making twenty-two miles in
1 hour 15 mm.
The packet reached Granger, Wyo., at 10:24
o'clock last night. It should have arrived
there, according to the schedule, at 5:42 p. M.
The packet is due at Raw i ins, Wyo., at 2:45
P. m. to-day, but the chances are that this point
will not be reached before 5 o'clock.
Crossing the La ramie plains some lost time
should be made up. From the summit of the
Rockies to Omaha, a distance of 600 milos,
much time lost west of the Continental Divide
should be regained.

A notable exhibit at the Mechanics' Fair

diameter and weighs exactly 608 pound?.
It was built at the Fallon creamery in
Marin County and arrived at the Dairy
men's Union store at 113-119 Davis street
yesterday. It contains 822 gallons, or
6580 pounds, of milk. It was made by the
Cheddar process, under the supervision of
F. P. Pearson, who is one of the greatest
experts in the State and who will be the
instructor in the manufacture of butter
and cheese at the dairymen's exhibit at
the State Fair, which opens in Sacra
mento on Tuesday.
The quarter-ton exhibit is not intended
merely as an object-lesson to lovers of
cneese. All tbe cheddar of the latter
product comes from the East and Cali
fornia creameries dave found it difficult to
compete with this variety. California
ctieese is all made for immediate sale,
while cheddar, as is known, is not fit for
use until it has been cured at least six
months. If the California product of
Cheddar is a success it is predicted that it
will sweep the Eastern article out of the
market.

Congressman McCall and wife of Massa
chusetts and Mr. and Mrs. L. D. Apsley,
the former the vice-chairman of the Re
publican National Congressional Com
mittee, arrived last night from the East
and were met at the Palace Hotel by. Major
Frank McLaughlin, chairman of the Re
publican State Central Committee, and by
Mr. Higgins, secretary of the com
mittee.
The visitors will remain in this State
long enough to go over the political
ground, and then they will visit Oregon
and Washington. To-day the party will
be the guests of John D. Spreckels and will
make a voyage around the bay and its
approaches in Mr. Spreckels' yacht.
When questioned by a Call reporter as
to the purpore of bis mission Mr. Apsley
said:
"It was thought desirable on the part
of the officers of the committee to have
definite and exact information regarding
the situation in the various Congressional
districts throughout the country and, as
j vice-chairman of the committee, 1 have
j visited Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Ne
i braska, and the other States on the line of
the Union Pacific to California, and I ex
pect to return through the States lying on
the border of Canada.
â¢'My colleague, Congressman McCall,
has accompanied me at my invitation for
the purpose of making speeches, as I
thought it advisable to hold meetings
along our route. He has spoken in Michi
gan, and in nearly every State from
Michigan westward the meetings have
been very enthusiastic and great crowds
have turned out to hear him. I expect to
hold several meetings in the Pacific Coast
States.
"I have been very favorably impressed
with the strong sentiment for McKinley
which I find everywhere. The Republi
cans have no ground for fear in any of the
Northern States east of Nebraska, and in
Nebraska the Republicans have gone to
work with an excellent prospect of carry
ing it. I believe that the majorities in all
the Northern Btites east of the Missouri
River will be overwhelmingly for McKm
ley. The people there are not to be misled
by the appeals to prejudice whicn the
Democratic canddate is sending forth.
They know Mr. Bryan to be the Demo
cratic free- trader who made such a noise
in favor of free trade four years ago, and
they are not fools enough to swallow any
more of his quack medicine.
"1 am strongly of the opinion from
what I have seen that the half dozen
States of the broken South with perhaps
three or four of the small mining States
will be all he will J>e able to carry, and
they remember the times they had in this
country up to four years ago. and they
will not repeat the blunder of 1892. They
don't care to have the Democratic party
perform them any longer, no matter what
promises they may make."
Mr. Apsley reported having had an ex
cellent meeting at Colorado Springs, in
Colorado, where he found a strong senti
ment for McKinley. Congressman Mc-
Call spoke there and Mr. Apsley held a
meeting in Colorado City, which was one
of the most enthusiastic meetings he ever
addressed.
Congressman McCall is the authorof the
expression, "pressing a crown of tnorns
upon the brow of labor." Mr. Bryan,
typically Democratic, stole this^phrase to
manufacture cheap campaign thunder.

ments, for which the residents of that section

will be taken in assisting the property-owners

UPON FINANCE.
Opening of the Democratic
Campaign in Cali
fornia.
THE TEMPLE MEETING.
The Southern Senator Discourses
on the Silver Ques
tion.
ATTACK ON SHERMAS'S VIEWS.
Democratic Criticism on the Past and
Present Utterances of Re
pub icaas.
Three thousand patriots Backed Metro
politan Temple to the doors last evening
long before 8 o'clock. The occasion of the
immense gathering was the opening of the
Democratic campaign in San Francisco.
Senator Stephen M. White, the eloquent
son of Southern California, was to teil the
people of the benefits to be derived from
another four years of Democratic rule un
der the guidance of "William J. Bryan, the
apostle of free trade and free silver.
The Senator from Los Angeles was late
in arriving, and the immense audience,
perspiring and impatient, found vent for
its feelings in cheering the mention of
Bryan, whose name was proposed for
three cheers and a tiger every few minutes.
At 8 :20 the honored guest arrived, escorted
by a brats band and the Iroquois Club,
William J. Alford, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee,
called the meeting to order, and in intro
ducing the speaker of the evening, *aid:
"We are here to-night to open the Dem
ocratic campaign in California. We have
no apologies to make and no excuses to
offer, but will go to battle under one
standard, the free coinage of silver." He
introduced Charles D. Lane, the chairman
of the meeting.
Mr. Lane disclaimed being an orator
and then did his best to deliver an ora
tion. He said that fie is not a candidate
for any office, and explained why he is an
advocate of free silver, although a gold
miner. He talked briefly on the financial
question and then introduced Senator
Stephen M. White, whose remarks were
preceded by the effort of a weak-lunged
quartet, led by a tenor whose ancient
song, rendered in a slang phrase, de
scribed a wisbed-for result of tue Novem
ber election.
Senator White said in part:
The issues which the people of this country
are called upon to solve are of momentous
consequence. In no day within my recollection
has there been manifested such a condition as
displays ltse.f to-day. Parties seem to some
extent to be disrupted, and men who formerly
were found with this or that particular politi
cal family seem to doubt where they belong.
There seems to me, however, to be no question
of where the patriot belongs.
When I come here to-nigh t after talking with
many of my Republican friends and with
many of my owa political faith I wonder at
the lines which I see drawn and tne senti
ments of some ot those whom 1 have hereto
fore supposed felt real convictions upon which
they were willing to stand. I look at the Re
publican party of California, which I had sup
posed based its claims to life upon its actions
and upon its consi^encyâ upon those events
In its history which gave it claim to public
recognition.
I look at that organization two years ago. I
find it meeting here in solemn convention in
the State of California, its delegates lawfully
elected, and I find it resolving in favor of a
free and unlimited coinage of silver. I look
upon a more recent date and I find a similar
declaration in the cocveution of that organi
zation which sent to St. Louis those lawfully
elected tielegates who were pledged to the
adoption of tne same declaration of free silver
at a ratio of 16 to 1. I see these delegates of
that party too long dominant in this country
convened in the city oi St. Louis. I witnessed
nearly ail of them voting for tne free coinage
of silver at 16 to 1 and following the leader
ship of tbftt glorious Republican, Senator
Henry M. Teller of Colorado. I noticed the
conduct of that convention adverre to their
ideas. I see those same men who went to St.
Louis, advocates of the theory of 16 to 1, come
back to the State of California.
They went to St. Louis screaming for the
free and unlimited coinage of silver, and they
came back to California screaming for the
single goid standard. They come to this City
with no credentials from Caliiornia. They
left those in be Louis, and came back repu
diating the Btate platform of their party.
1 look at the great journalistic galaxy of
California. I look at the Bulletin and Call,
which have preached from time immemorial
the free coinage of silver, and. at the Chronicle,
which is edited by one of the most earnest of
silver's advocates, Mr. de Youug, who has
taught me much of my silver sentiment. I
know that he would not change his views for
anybody. On May 30, 1895, the Chronicle
printed one of the most splendid arguments
in faror of free silver ever written.
If it were not copyrighted I would have it
printed myself at my own expense. Now you
find Mr. de Young and his paper in favor of
the single gold standard. 1 do not wish to
disparage that gentleman, but say this to
snow you that there is a great power behind
this gold movement, which power nothing but
the sentiment of the great American people is
potential enough to overcome. It is to that
sentiment that I appeal. It is to that Ameri
can people who cannot be intimidated that
tne Democracy of to-day appeals.
What is this silver issue? Mr. McKinley ha.=
f eni his elaborate message to the American
veople. He devotes a considerable part of it
to the discussion of the free coinage of silver.
He admits that it 1b not well that we should
hare gold monometallism, but says there is no
remedy for it, and that the great remedy for
which the American people have been pinine
and sighing Is that we have more taxes; the
great remedy which he suggests to Americans
is more taxes. He asks: "How cim we sup
port our Government without sufficient rev
enue?" But, gentlemen, let me ask Mr. Me-
Kinley how it Is possible for us lo pay taxes
unless we hare something to pay taxes with?
Is there anything novel about this matter of
free coinage of silver? Some of our friends
uno call themselves Democrats, a few who
hold office and a few less who do not, tell us
that it would be a terrible thing to declare in
favor of Ifce free coinage of silver, and occa
sionally cal! upon the shades of Jackson ana
Jefferson to testify against our claim, suppos
ing and hoping that no one will ever investi
gate the fact or the conditions.
If I am to speak to Democrats I suppose I
may refer to the constitution of the Lniied
States as at least to some extent worthy of
consideration. Mr. Vanderbilt made use of a
famous expression, in which he said, "the
people be damned." Mauy of our former
Democratic friends have used a similar ex
pression in reference to the constitution and
particularly to that portion of It which says
that no State may change the law in regard to
making certain kinds of money legal tenders,
and also in regard to that portion which says
that no State shall issue money.
The Bland act made silver legal tender and
thus far it was all that could be asked, but it
limited the functions and power ot silver be
cause it restricted the extent of its coinage,
and the contention of the Democratic party in
that never can there be a fair te-t between gold
and silver until each are given the same
chance before the law. As well might we at
tempt to take two men of equal phyhical
strength and actual ability and engagethem
in a iootmce and tie one foot of one of the con
testants an<i leave the overman totally free
and expect them to come out equal at the end
oi the: race as to suppose silver shoulu come
out equal with gold when hampered with toe
fetters of adverse legislation.
Again> about the Matthews resolution. It
was attempted in some quarters to restrict the
Sower of redemption to gold alone. Senator
atthews of Ohio, one of the ablest men of
the Republican party, introduced and there
was passed in the Senate and House, a resolu
tion containing among other things, the fol
lowing:
"That all the bonds of the United States are
payable, principal and interest, at the option
of the Government of the United States in
silver dollars of the coinage of the United
States con taiaing <V&,i grains each of sUauard
silver, and that to restrict to its coinage less,
silver coins as legal tender is not a violation
of the public's f*ith or a derogation of the
rights ot the public's creditors."
The assembled wisdom o; Democracy and
Republicanism voted for that resolution, yet
to-day you find the apostles of Wall street and
Lombard street shedding tears of sorrow be
cause of the do ctrines oi the Democracy. It is
needless for me to refer to subsequent votes in
Congress in the same d irection.
As far as platforms are concerned, in 1880
there was a declaration in favor of honest
money in the Democratic platform. That kind
of honest money consists of gold or sliver or
paper convertible into paper on demand. In
other words, the Democratic party in 188J de
clared in favor of this kind of honest money,
com of silver or gold and paper convertible
Into coin. To-day we hear of another kind of
honest money.
We see some old fellow tottering along under
the weight of accumulated profits. He comes
to us and 6ays: "Do not make silver again a
legal tender. We people who have been loan
ing money have suffered from that kind of
thing long enough. We do not want to be
paid in this kind of money. We want hqnest
money." What is his definition of honest
money ? He means the money which is the
dearestâ money the hardest to get, money for
which the most of human labor must be ex
pended, and in the procurement of which
tear* must flow with a maximum from the
human heart. These are his ideas of honest
money. The best money, according to him, is
that which is hardest to get. Is it the best
money for you and I? We have a great deal
of trouble to get enoueh silver to enable us to
pass along the roadway of life.
Assume, my friends, that our anticipations
of the advantages of the free coinage oi silver
are indeed unfounded. What harm will be
done? If we pass a law providing for the free
and unlimited coinage of silver, will our Re
publican friends die in a spasm of woe? Will
it not be possible for us, if we have made a mis
take, to change our plan? Shall our ill-ad
vised system at once paralyze the world's
progress?
What would they say if we read the res oln
tions of the California bankers? Kow the
bankers are our friends. When we want any
thing we interview them, but we seldom get
anything for nothing. When we are absolutely
broke we do not apply to them, because we
would not get anything. Now, onr banking
friends have met and they have all resolved
that silver is wrong. My friends, whenever
you find any class ot people who all believe
that the other tellow is wrong, look out. It is
a combination.
Has anything happened in connection with
our financial history to lead us to think that
the demonetization of silver was fraught witn
disaster to the American people? I have be
fore me a quotation from a speech by Senator
Sherman. The speech was made on July 11,
1876. He said ''the effect of the law in Ger
many and as its consequence, the partial de
monetization of silver, caused an immediate
scramble for the possession of gold, and there
fore what we have oDserved recently is not so
much the fall of silver, as it ia the rise of
the price of gold." Still, as you have no doubt
observed, Mr. Sherman has lately delivered
an address, in which he has said that gold has
never gone np, but that silver has gone down.
Secretary Carlisle, another wanderer from
the ranks of Democracy into the nome of the
gold standard, said in 1SS8: "I know that the
world's stock of precious metals is none too
large and I see no reason to apprehend that it
will ever become so. Mankind will be iortu
nate, indeed, if the annual production of gold
and silver will keep pace with the aunual in
crease of population and industries." Yet Mr.
Carlisle, as Secretary of the Treasury, has
changed his views.
1 have quoted these authorities with the idea
of showing you that as far as the Democratic
party is concerned there is nothing novel or
startling in the principle of the free coinage
of silver, and as far as the Republican party is
concerned there is nothing remarkable in its
prognostications of failure.
We are told by the Republicans that the act
will be wrong, because it will produce for us a
50-cent dollar. Mr. McKinley says, in iiis let
ter of accepHÃÂ«e. that the Democratic party is
in favor of the 50-cent dollar. Why is the
Democratic party in favor of the 50-cent dol
lar? Because the Democratic party is in favor
of restoring silver to the place it occupied in
'73? First, let us consider if we are advocating
the proposition favoring the reduction of a
dollar to 50 cents. Let me ask what they call
a 50-cent dollar, as they are pleased to term
it? Is it not as much of a crime to make a
gold dollar worth 200 cents as it is to make a
silver dollar worth but 50 cents?
Is it true that we advocate a 50-cent dollar?
As far as California is concerned, in my hum
ble opinion, it has already sounded the death
kneil of the go & standard. I deny that we
would have a 50-cent dollar if the Democrat. c
party is victorious. Since 1878 to this hour
you have legislated against silver. Your rep
resentatives have listened to those who wished
a gold standard. Silver thus preyed upon,
thus discredited, has come down in the mar
ket, and now you wish to build a standard
upon your own iniquities. I a-k you if you
can afford to talk of a ratio between the metals
until you have raised silver lo its pristine
dignity?
They say everybody krew that silver was be
ing demonetized in 1873. If thatfwas true
then everybody was a fool. But everybody
didn't know it. The best proof that the people
did not know it is shown by the press ex
pressions of the time. The great papers of the
nation contained not a word about it. More
than two years had passed before It was
known, and then it was found that some of
tbe most ardent silver men of the West had
voted for it. The papers contained not a word
about it at the time, and my experience with
newspaper reporters has taught me that if
there is anything pub:ic (and, indeed, I was
about to say private) they are very apt to know
about it.
Mr. Carlisle said recently that Jefferson ad
vised the cessation of tbe coinage of silver dol
lars. >Vhy did Mr. Carlisle not tell all the
truth? Jefferson did advise that no more sil
ver dollars be coined, but he advised the un
limited free coinage of all other forms of sil
ver. Why did he de*ire no more silver dollars?
gimp'.y because they were so valuable they
were being exported.
About the time gold was discovered in Cali
fornia the gold fields were opened up in Aus
tralia. The supply of gold greatly over
topped that of silver. And so throughout the
whole history of the metals first one has been
up and then the other, but the great system of
bimetallism remeined unshaken. Wny? Be
cause the legislation has been the same.
If you prohibited by law the use of flour
in this City would it affect the value of flour
in -this City? If you took Fold, and all the
great countries of the world demonetized gold,
do you tell me that it would not affect the
value of goid? If this country alone should
say that gold should not be used as a specie of
final redemption, do you tell me that it would
not affect the value of gold ia the markets of
the world?
We are informed by McKinley and Harrison
that they don't want much money, but they
want the best money. In a speech delivered
at San Jose by my friend, Mr. fcstee, he said
there was not gold money enough to carry on
business, and bo we must have silver money.
I suppose he is saying the same thing to-night.
I have no doubt Mr. Estee will repeat every
thing I attribute to him, but he may do what
our courts sometime do â labor to differentiate.
Our Republican friends in the St. Louis con
vention told something of their friendship for
silver. They said they were in favor of bimet
allism, but held that until the nations of the
world united we must stay by the gold stand
ard. They said it was a bad thing, but we
must stay by it until some one gives us some
thing else. " . ,
Mr. Estee says of that: '-The gold people
say we cannot have bimetallism until we have
an international monetary system. We might
just as well wait until we get an international
government and an international l&ngnage."
i am with you, Mr. Estee, heart to heart and
word for word to this extent.
Our friends say that if . we had.free silver we
would De giving the silver barorA $1 29 for $1.
The silver baron will have no more rights than
you or I. He will then be able to fake his sil
ver to the mint and have it coined as he pre
sents it. How will this give him an advan
tage? Because they say there is . too much
silver in the world? - Have you seen it? The
great thing I have experienced is a scarcity of
money. ; My . friends : on the other side have
always told me that money is not scarce If you
only know where to look for it. ; \
* .People have said if you have a double stan
dard what is to prevent the cornering of all
the silver? TDis arises from: a series ofÂ»mis
conceptions. In the first place, the forces and
the men have been at work for years working
toward the cornering of gold. . Russia s has
000,000 or $600,000,000 of gold which
she keeps : in a chest *as a sort of , war fund.
Austria has $150,000,000 of gold which she
borrowed from the Rothschilds. I* is not in
circulation, and paper money is used alone.
Germany preserves her sold. :;:. ;" ; '
' France and Germany 'demonetized silver,
almost at the same time. \.,\,
The United States came In and did the same
thing, as I have said, without rhyme or reason.
The fact of history is that while this 1 govern
ment maintained silver at the ratio of 16 to 1,
ox 15 to 1, the metals remained on a parity. li
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 30, 1896.
Senator Stephen M. "White Addressing: the Democratic Mass-Meeting-.
out of the house of your friends or your
parents you are sent discredited, what is
your condition ?
Onr friends say to me, It Is true the ratio was
an right up to 1873, but we odly coined about
$8,000,000 ud to that time. Aye, but we had
tne Civil War during that period. If It is an
argument againt silver to say it did not circu
late during that period, why is it not an
equal argument agaiust gold, which did not
circulate, either?
There never was a system more unjustly con
structed than our present financial laws. What
are our greenbacks? Simply promises to pay.
What are our bonds? They are simply prom
ises to pay.
If it cost the last dollar we had 1 would re
deem every dollar we have promised to pay.
But when we made a contract in tbe bright
light oi day to pay in coin, I say when the
bankers and the syndicates present their
greenbacks, let us say to them silver is our
coin.
When we have all been summoned hence
perhaps some other circulating medium than
gold or silver will have to be used. Gold is
j already greatly consumed in the arts and
sciences.
Tne statement that there fs limitless silver
in the earth bas no ground except in appre
hension. It is an old expression of the miner
that one man can see as far into me earth as
another. If silver is worth to the mining man
at the mint $1 29, wilt it not have some value
to the laboring man too? Can it have a higher
value to one man than another ?
Let me recapitulate these three propositions.
First, it cannot be denied by any one who is
arguing in good faith that we had bimetallism
from if 92 to 1873; second, tb at during that
time the amounts of the metals fluctuated
greatly; and third, thai during that time the
ratio of 15% ana 16 to 1 was maintained with
out business embarrassment. Ever since 1873
all the products of the swil have been going
down. Previous to 1893 history shows us that
the prices of products went up. There have
been constant fluctuations in commercial
vaiues of money, but the prices of agricultural
products have invariably followed silver,
giving as pathetic an indication as Inanimate
things can that they were destined to die to
gether.
If the action of this Government will appre
ciate silver, if France was able to maintain 15
to 1 when the fluctuations were ereuter than
they are now. I do not see why this country, so
iiiuch greater and more populous, cannot act
independently.
My Republican friends, only two years aeo
you criticized us because you said we were
aping England when we wanted a little lower
tariff. I do not believe in inveighing against
any foreign country, but if we "have not the
power to maintain a financial policy of our
own, then we must abrogate tbe functions of
government.
According to the letter of their bond let the
judgment be written ; but let us not give more
than we have promised. We have no margin
for generosity, but if we have, let it be given to
those of our own people who so greatly need it.
I ask that the people of this country be loyal
to their own Nation before they are loyal to
any other.
In conclusion Senator White called at
tention to the declaration of the Demo
cratic platform in regard to the funding
bill. He mghlv eulogized Judge Maguire,
the mention of whose name was loudly
applauded.
The meeting adjourned with cheers for
the ticket and the platform.
A NERVY BURGLAR.
Richard Davenport Enters a Honse on
Kearny Street and Ig Placed
Under Arreat.
Richard Davenport, who gives his occu
pation as that of a miner, was arrested
last evening on Montgomery avenue by
Officers George McMahon and J. B. Freehl,
and detained at the California-street Po
lice station on a charge of burglary.
Davenport entered a building occupied
by J. W. Steneart as a dwelling and variety
store, at 1215 Kearny street, and stole a
tin box containinj; $30 in coin and jewelry
valued ai $20. He also added to his pos
eession a purse containing $10.
Mr. Steneart and his wife were dining
at the time. The prisoner entered the
building by a side door and crossing the
store, gaiDed access to the bedroom. He
seized the box and purse and started to
leave the building, when he was detected
by Fteneart, who pursued him. On reach
ing Montgomery avenue Davenport turned
down it and ran into the arms or the offi
cers who placed him under arrest.
The stolen articles were found on Daven
port's person when he was searched at the
station. He acknowledged Lav us looted
the house and saia that he was hungry
and being unable to obtain food concluded
to steal.

THEY UNITED ALL
THE PATRONAGE.
A Secret of the Democrapu
list Fusion Scheme
Leaks Out
THE GOULD-M'NAB GAME
The Congressional Patronage
Was the Price Asked cf
Candidate Maddux.
POLITICS AND THE MACHINE*
Gould Plays the Fnsio.i Game to Get
the Governorsu p, and Oth
ers Have Their Marks.
L. J. Maddux, Democratic nominee for
Congress in the Seventh district. Las re
fused to tarn over his possible party patron
age to a small bunch of ambitious Demo
cratic politicians who are bossing the
Democratic end of tbe fusion game tbat
is now being played.
' For this reason Mr. Maddux is wholly
out of the fusion race. Then* is no possi
bility of the fusion committee agreeing
upon him as the fusion candidate. It is
thoroughly understood, and it has become
a practical certainty that Castle, the Popu
list nominee, will be the fusion candidate
if the mess of fusion and party committees
now playing the ; game ever reach the
point of declaring a fusion Congressional
ticket. . .
The secret that party patronage and
personal ambitions were the controlling
factors in the Democrapulist bunko game,
for which a lot of gqliticians are now sharp
ening their wits, has been more than Sus
pected for some little \ time, but it is now
out with much confidential but reliable
testimony to back it up. \
It became known yesterday to a num
ber of Democrats who are not in the inside
of the select fusion ring that a member of
the Democratic State Central Committee,
who represented other powers as well as
himself, asked ; Maddux the other day
if he would cede his patronage to . the
bosses of i the Democratic State Central
Committee :if; he were '. msde the fusioa
candidate and elected. = ' ,
Mr, Maddux indignantly and promptly
refused to enter into any such deal. It
soon became ? . current and reliable i inside
information that Castle is to be the fusion
candidate/There i^ ' no evidence at large
that Mr. Castle has deeded : away his
hoped-for Congressional patronage . and
influence. ' . J"'' ' \: : .. '
; This is the secret of tbe usioa game in
all the ? seven districts. It is a play for
present â  and ; future ;. political power and
patronage, and 'â  there are an -.interesting
let of players. The 3 politically wise who
know the men aud issues involved and the
natural and sure r course of party politics
laugh quietly at the high-flown talk about
patriotism and such like that some of ; the
players indulge in. -â¢>;? â¢ '
â  Uis well known to those; on the inside
tbat Frank H. Â« Gould 'iv and Gavin McNab
are the biggest bosses who are -pulling the
strings from the Democratic side â¢ in . this
fusion game. It is a continuation, of ; the
game that Gould and ; McNab ; have been
playing with tne State party machine for
a year or more. /: .i j\:?-.-'- -cs-! â :%;: v-^vi a -^f :\;
; >Frank H. Gould has long had a consum
ing ambition vto 'I. secure ,: the Democratic
nomination for Governor two years < from
now. J "Gavin McNab wants 'A first * and . al
ways to acquire the power of a boss in the
City and in the State/and when fit; comes
to getting something : else s he is generally
understood to be oat for the best he can:
get without having to t depend on a popu
lar election. hBÂ£PKBMBSAO&
--) Mr. r McNab has long been j known to
have in his : mind's eye the attorneyship
for a Sheriff or a Public Administrator ,\ in
San V Francisco, but it has now become
generally known' that Mr. McNab has re
flected that be might just as well* set his
mark i high! and s play v for an election as
United States Senator - two years from
now. r r'-.v'.':- .;.-; -. . ;â¢.â¢:;â '"":' â â â ...
To achieve these ambitions and to ac
complish the .political things that must
precede and attend their fulfillment re
quires the control and the manipulation
of the State machine during this cam
paign and during the preparations for the
State campaign two years lrcm now.
Gould was elected chairman of the last
State Convention through the long opera
tions of himself as chairman of the Sate
Central Committee, Gavin McNab, Sum
Rainey, John Da_-gett and others. He
named the committees which directed the
course of the convention, and he named
the twenty influential members at large
of the present State Central Cocamittee.
But even more than that, as far as
present pertinency is concerned, Gould
and McNab made Alford, the youthful
Visalia attorney, chairman of the present
State Central Committee. Mr. Alford was
not a member of the committee and
aid not dream of the job until one day he
received from .McNab, with Gould's
knowledge and consent, a letter asking
him if he would accept the position.
There happened to be no candidate in
the field. Mr. Alford was favorably
Known, and when his name dropped into
public notice from some unknown source
there was no opposition and he was easily
elected.
Mr. Alford is a young, gentlemanly,
honorable, sincere, inexperienced, able,
industrious and popular campaign man
ager. Mr. Gould, the late chairman, and
Mr. McNaD, so long a political hustler, are
quite experienced. Their fund of advice
is exhaustless and freely given. It is
freely and frequently accepted. Mr. Al
ford owes his job and his prominence to
Gould and McNab. Mr. Alford has ap
pointed two fusion committees and all
other committees. â  Gouid and McNab
talk with other people sometimes. Gouid
and McNab are ambitious. The machine
is at work.
Then there are several other people, but
never mind, just take Tarpey. Tarpey
was chairman of the first Democratic
fusion committee and a big fusion influ
ence. It transpires that Tarpey is to be
the fusion candidate in the T i:d District.
Yes, it's great politics, this fusion came,
and in it men who have been nominated
by the people at their conventions be
come playthings of a few ambitious and
scheming politicians, and have their ups
and downs jus., like candidates in one of
Sam Rainey s conventions.
The prospects, however, that anything
will be accomplished in the line of Con
gressional fusion grow beautifully less
hour by hour, as candidates and party
men generally who are not on the inside
of the ring see through the games that are
being played.
Monteith, the Populist nominee in the
First District; JicGla&han, the Populist
nominee in the Second 'District; Kelly,
the Democratic nominee in the Fifth
District; Barlow, the Populist nominee in
the Sixth District, and Maddux, the
Democratic nominee in the Seventh
District, have in positive and unmistak
able terms declared that they would not
resign. The information could not be
suppressed that in all these districts the
programme was settled in advance that
these candidates were to be turned down,
tbe proper deals having been male.
There will be other snags for the fusion
committee at its meeting to-morrow and
ior its future efforts.
NEW TO-DAY.
\
DID YOU EVER STUDY THE SOURCE OP THE GREAT ENERGY WHICH
-*^ keeps up your animal life â that wonder unseen force which comes to your aid
when you desire to put forth a special effort in mental or physical action Didn't it
: ever seem to you that there must be something very peculiar about it â how it responds
to your. will and steels your nerves for the great final effort ?
What is it? ; ,
' It is the vital or nerve force of your system. It is the foundation of your physical
mental ana sexual manhood; it is the nerve erit, energy, vitality which Nature bestows
upon you, which is known as your reserve force and which comes to your aid in all
cases when you wish to call forth all the power of your manhood.
This reserve force should be at yoar command until you are past fifty, at which
time Nature changes her course and, instead of storing her power, beeins to use up the
reserve force, which is supposed to keep up your vita! energy to a good old age. ;
But some men begin to fail at fifty, some at forty, some are lost at thirty-fire.
Early habits, excesses, dissipation, have used up the force of vitality which should
have been stored; and when the time comes that Nature refuses longer to support ; the
body and it is lett to its own resources it â exhausted. Then comes dreaded
nervous debility, mental decay, lack of capacity for business or pleasure.
Scientific test proves that the nerve or vital force of the body is nothing more nor
less than Electricity. If we* had no electricity. in our bodies we could not live. Dis-
obedience to the laws of Nature drains and wastes the Electric energy from the body
wasting the reserve force. To regain' it we must use Electricity, which is tne basis of*
all vital power. T . ".' , ] '.-..â  .:
DR. SANOEN'S ELECTRIC BELT
Is used by the foremost doctors in extreme cases of nervous exhaustion, and is ac- i
knowledged by them superior to drugs or any other remedy. In truth, it is a cure for
such troubles after all medical treatment fails. It is made especially for (he restoration
of nerve and vital power in men. It infuses the even, continuous Electric current into
the body for hours at a time, charging ail the vital parts with new life, restoring man-
hood completely in two months.

at figures that are simply startling, they are so
low.
This ranch consists of 1700 acres of the choicest
' land in the bÂ»autiiul >ania'C'.ara 'Valley. It is
located near Mountain View, and is - one of the
finest properties In the state for a home. It is
reached from Mountain ViÂ» â¢â ,â â :â  by three hne coun-
try roads: the Gran, road the Spilnger road and
the Moody road. . - .- â  . . - :. ; â  â¢ â¢ .
. It has a frontage of about two miles on Fremont
aye..' a coun y ro. d leaJin.' direct to San Jo*e,
only nine miles ili,t;-nt. This l'remont aye. wi:i
be extended a'ong th- foothl Is : to the Stanford '
University, which will make the distance of this
proper. y to | the university only oily five miles; it .
is 39 miles sou h of San Francis o, and there arc-

'C Soilâ The 'soil, of this ranch is adapted for fruit.
1 and vines. : One can see exactly what the soil grill
produ c. for on cv rv side there ar>- orchards and

shortly is to say that the soil of the Male Tract is !
adapted to fruit and vines, and vvi.l show ud equal
to any soil in he fruit belt. ' â

of frontage s miiKe it possible .to subdivide :to ;
great advantage. There are dozens of handsome j
building sites on the ranch and- he view is beauti-
ful., Before you, stretching on either side a dis-
tance of thirty miles, lies the famous and charm-
ing Santa Clara Valiey, with its hundred! of beau-
tiful orchard homes in plain view. In th -distance, {
only six miles away, lies the bay of San Francisco,' j
stretching in plain view for a distance of thirty
miles. i o the rghi :i-s Mount ; Hamilton: to the i
left is seen the Stanford University, and in the
rear rises the word-famous Santa Cruz Mountains
to a he! hi of 1500 feet, making a surrounding that
is beautiful enough for the most fastidious. This
ranch is in the warm belt and does no suffer from
frosts an I fogs that are often j complained lof in ,
other ! arts of the State. ; . '
' Fruitsâ The varieties of fruits that can be raised !
here are the prune, â  peach, pear, olive, almond, j
English walnut, cherry, apricot, lemon, orange, i
grape and all semi-tropical fruits. ; â  . ,
On the adjoining place of J. J. Bergln can be
seen orange trees in full bearing: also prunes
grape* and : other fruits, on the apjoluing place
of J. C. Campbell can be seen an olive orchard in
full bearing; aso prunes and apricots. On the
ranch of Mam Costello, also adjoining, can be
seen in lull bearing prunes, grapes,' apricots and
English nuts. Among the busm ss mcii of |
tan . Francisco who have places adjoinin,' I his
ranch are: John i. Sabln, \\ niiam costello J. c.
Cam pbe.l, Joseph Hladky, G. v. Morgan, N. J. |

sell, A J. Robinson and tiers.
Roads-Th ... ranch has three county roads lead-
ingtoi: All of them are fine, well-kept drives,
and two of them are sprinkled in summer.
General outlineâ Tue ranch is dotted with mag- !
nificent live-oak in es, and it is rol, lng enough to
give It a handsome appearance. â¢ It Is convenient
.10 the depot, schools ana postoffice and market. !
The butcher, the baker, vegetaDle man. laundry- j
man an.l grocer call at your door the same as in !
the ; city, a telephone line run 3 through the I
ranch. The drives are delightful, the roads splen- |
did and the country beaui.if,.l.
â  l limateâ only thing necessary to say about
the climate is that it is in Santa Clara County, and
li the finest in the State. '

DAMMING A CREEK
Farmer Hogrefe Positive
He Used No Vulgar
Language.
DISCOVERS HIS ERROR.
Ordered to Build a Fish-Ladder
Worth More Than His Ranch
in Crow Creek.
PUBNISHED WITH A PUZZLE.
'Unable to Solve It, but Certain There
Is No Room for It in the
Creek.
Oakland Office San Frakci?co Call,)
90S Broadway, Au.i. 20. |
H. Hogreie of Crow Canyon Creek is to
be prosecuted next Tuesday in the Justices'
court of San Leandro because he did* not
erect an elaborate fish-ladder, costing
about $1000, across a creek in which there
is but two inches of water and in which
any fish protected by the State Fish Com
mission would be stranded. At least this
is Mr. Hogreia's story. '
Farmer Hogrefe owns â subject to a
mortgage, of courseâ a little ranch near
Crow Canyon, He has a few horses and
cows, and although he manages to grow
sufficient food for his stock, he has diffi
culty during the summer months in pro
. curing water. His position is similar to
that of dozens of other farmers in hiÂ» lo
cality, and hence the great interest taken
in his particular case.
A few weeks ago Farmer Hoirrefe built
a small dam across the fast-lowering
creek and in toe middje he placed a fish
ladder, such as He understood was re
quired. He applied to the headquarters
of the Fish Commission, and loliowed
their instructions as best he could. Sev
eral days ago he was arrested "for illegally
damming a creek."
Hogrefe read the warrant, and as he is a
religious man he was greatly discon
certed. He could riot recall any time
when he had used any vulgar language,
and so went posthaste to hisiriend George
â¢Toyne of Hay wards and asked his assist
ance in regard to thÂ« alleged infringe
ment of the lights of^tiie people of the
â¢ State of California. Mr. . Toyne is an
orator and a veiy erudite naturalized
Englishman. He read the Declaration of
Independence last Fourth of July and to
night officiated, at a select Populist gath
ering at Sunol. Mr. Toyne at once set
.his friend Hogrefe right. The warrant
was issued by the Fish Commission for
illegally restraining the waters of the
â¢ Crow Canyon Creek.
Farmer Hogrefe at once asked the
proper authorities what he should do.
He received a very elaborate plan of a
fish-ladder that must Da placed in all
creeks that are dammed. There were side
â¢ elevations and front views and rear eleva
tions and end sections, and rows of figures
and hieroglyphics that were as Sanskrit
to Farrrer Hogrefe.
The big blue print looked something like
a cathode-ray nÂ» ative of the ruins of a
large frame Duiiding, wherein each piece
was seen through those between it and the
eye. Neither Farmer Hogreie nor Mr.
Toyne could do anything with it, and, in
fact, neither would have made an affi
davit as to which was the top or which
"was the bottom.
"I don't know what to do,' ' said Farmer
Hogrefe to-day. â¢ "The plans I have were
used for a big State dam near Folsom,
and in Crow Creek there is not room
â enough for the plans, much less for the
elaborate structure that would cost not
less than $1000. It is all nonsense to ex
pect me to build it. It would cost more
than my farm is worth, and yet I am told
that if Ido not put it in I shall be fined
$200. The commission has never even
stocked the creek with fish, and it would
useless for them to do so, as there is not be
'an inch of water in it at this time of the
year, and if I had not saved some water
in my little dam I should have to go out
of business.'' \

MACDONOUGH'S MANAGER
Mark Thall, a Native Sod,
Newly Brought Out From
the East.
Oaklani Hta Made More Progress in
S x Years Than Any Other C ty
on the Coast.
Oakland Office Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 29. (
Mark Thall, the new manager of the
Macdonough Theater, arrived from the
Mark Thai!, a Native Son, the New Manager of the Macdonough Theater.
Esst to-day and will at otice take charge
of Oakland's only first-class playhouse.
Since Messrs. Fried lander and Gottlob
leased the Macdonough they hare been
looking for a capable man of experience to
attend to their interests on this side of the
bay, and at leneth decided on Mr. Thall.
Some time aso Mr. Thai! was manager of
the Alcazar Theater in its prosperous
days, and from there lie went East, from
whence he returns full of ideas, of which
he intends to give this city the full benefit
"In 1870 I played with the first company
that opened the old Dietz Opera-house,"
said Manager Thall to-day. "We opened
wiih Macdonough <fe Ernshaw' Royal
Marionettes, and in tnose days Oakland
looked upon a marionette show as a first
class attraction. For many years I re
sided hereâ 1 am a Native Bonâ and now
that I have been absent a few years I
hardly know the city.
"People living here do not notice how
fast this city is growing. Six years ago
there was not a theater here and not an
electric road, and I used to tnink that Oak
land and Petaluma were about on a par.
But now what arhanee! Thete is not a
more handsome theater for its size in this
country than the Macdonough. Of course,
there arc Inr^er house*, but the Macdon
ough is i\ little gem, and I was greatly sur
prised whnn 1 first saw it." *
Mr. Frieuiander uas reviewed this
county from a theatrical man's point of
view and predicts a bright future ior the
drama.
"For the past two years." said Mr.
Friediander, "Oakland has been booked
in the East as a nrst-clnss show-town.
Tliat is really a big advertisement, for
there is not a better medium to make
known a city than the theatrical piql'es
sion. All the railroads irom all over the
county center within two blocks of the
Macdonovti, r li, and any one residing with
in four miles of the house can reach it in
aoout twenty minutes at an expense of a
nickel.
"I know of no territory more favored
than this with electric roads and with
such a pretty playhouse. Precisely the
same methods that have made such a suc
cess of the Columbia will he folJowed here
and everything that is fir<t*elnss in San
Francisco wih be brought to Oakland, so
that people will not have to take the un
comfortable trip acroas the bay to witness
the teaUing playf."
Tiie new manager is not afraid of work.
Many years ago he was given a very lowly
position in the Bush-street Theater, anil
when lie retired from that house it was
after a successful career as manager, his
promotion being earned Step by step,
through indu-try and faithfulness.

S, G. HILBORN SPEAKS,
An Enthusiastic Meeting of
Republicans in Ala
meda
A Remark ible S'rangfr Who Wishes
(o Acquire the City's Indebted
ness at 3 Per Cent.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 29.â A most en
thusiastic meeting of Republicans was
held in Lindermaii Opera-house this even
ing, L. C. Sloane being in the chair. On
the platform were Messrs. E. A. Yon
Schmid;, Wheeler, Dunning, Johnson,
Barton, Young.
Hon. S. G. Hi! born said ha did not
want to talk politics, but just have a short
chat on business matters. He would visit
Alameda again later in the campaign.
After alluding to his being defeated for
Congress and his subsequent re-election,
he related the methods he adopted to
place the construction of the tidal canal
on the continuous contract system. This
meant that the people would never hare
occasion again to petition Congress for ap
propriations.
The engineers had only to furnish ecoÂ«
uomioal estimates of the amount of money
necessary to carry on the work from year
to year, and it would pass unchallenged.
Since his return he bad been made aware
that the original plans were to be deviated
from and were based on incomplet â¢ infor
mation. The tidal canal must be com
pleted, and he would take care that as far
as he was able the original plans were not
deviated from. As. to the posjotnee, he
remarked that Alameda wouid t;et that
building when Alaroeda's class was
readied, and that was not this year.
Otl.er cities have stronger claims. Hon.
Mr. Hilborn then described the work ac
complished by the last Congress and said
that, thanks to the able Tom Reed, nothing
was done therein to manufacture campaign
literature for the other side.
The tariff bill introduced by Dingley
would nave been law had it not been for
the Democratic and Populistic Senate, and
bad the measure been made law no deficit
in the treasury would have existed. The
Congress did not pass the funding bill and
for mat is entitled to the thank* of the
Nation.
He compared tue Powers and Reilly
funding bills, and showed while both were
bad the former was a pernicious measure*
The speaker told how he had voted and
worked against it, and thfÂ» result was that
the Southern Pacific was doing its best to
have his scalp. He drew three brief
sketches of the three men who sat near
him in Congress and with whom he was
chumming, McKinley, Bryan and Watson.
They were all three honest men, eood
men, men he liked, but each was different
from the other, and first and foremost of
the three was the next President of the
United States. He wished the women
could vote, ior if such was the case there
would be no doubt who would next oc
cupy the While House. For Bryan he
said little, either one way or the other, ex
cept that he was a oeclaimer who learned
his speeches by heart.
Watson was disposed of with Tom
Reed's dictum that he rfever knew exactly
what scripture meant by a wild ass's colt
until he met Tom Watson. The Republi
can party, he believed, was created to
meet great National emergencies, to bring
order out of chaos, and such a condition
of things existed now.
"With the St. Louis platform of protec
tion and sound money, with such a plat
form and such a leader," he said, "the
Republican party cannot fail of victory in
the fall."
Mr. Hilborn then left for Oakland to
speak there, and Colonel Talcott of Oak
land and others addressed the audience.
A Man With Capital
ALAMEDA, Cal., Au â .;, 29.â An indi
vidual named Frederick Fowler came into
the city yesterday claiming to represent
Eastern capital. Fowler was going to buy
the city's bonded indebtedness up on a 3
per c-nt basis and establish a glace fruit
factory in the town at an expenditure of
$750,000. All he wanted was assur
anceâassurance from tne Trustees that for
the first ten years the assessments on the
property and improvements should be
nominal. His ingenuous manner pleased
bis auditors and the bonafides of the gen
tleman was not called in question. The
evening papers took hold of the matter
and an Oakland journal this morning
wanted to Know why the Oakland Board
of Trade allowed such an inestimable
prize to roost in its sister city.
Fowler was to be at the City Clerk's of
fice at 10 o'clock this morning to exhibit
his credentials and further unfold his
plans, but so far he has failed to mater
ialize. He went to school in Oakland
twenty -odd years ago and is supposed to
have just returned irom Mexico and has
not yet been acclimated.
Fowler visited the public library and in
quired into its management, the number
of volumes on the shelves and the average
daily circulation. To Librarian Har
bourne it was suggested that he should
approach the stranger on the feasibility of
erecting the library building so dear to his
heart. Bui Harbourne said he was not
looking for June bngs, and suggested he
should visit the City Clerk. On the
road to the City Hall he fell in with a real
estate agent, and to him Fowler remarked
that he wanted a large block of land to
erect a fireworks factory on. "Americans
are j*reat people for letting off powder and
squibs, so it is sure to pay."
It was to the City Cierk he narrated his
intention of erecting a glace-fruit factory
and buying up the bonds. The City Clerk
felt the project was too good to keep him
self and he mentioned the matter to sun
dry newspaper men, but on no account
would he mention the name of the party
interested, because the Southern Pacific
might get in and spoil the whole business
and take him elsewhere, nor was the mat
ter to get into the papers.

California State Union Kesolnda the
Resolutions Passed at the Fresno
Session.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 29.â The trouble
over the resolution passed by the State
Typographical Union No. 6, at its recent
session at Fresno, is ended.
C. D. Rogers of Oakland, of the executive
committee, gave out the following for pub
lication this afternoon:
Oakland, August 29, 1896.
Whereas, California State Typographical
Union No. 6, at its session held in the city of
Fresno on August 13, 14 and 15, 1896, at the
request of Sacramento delegates, passed cer
tain resolutions bearing on the management
of the State printing office at Sacrameuto; and
whereas, the State Typographical Union
understood ihat it was the desire of Sacra
mento Union that the resolutions should be
adopted; and whereas, the right to control its
own affairs is vested ia the local union (I. T.
U.). the action taken, therefore, was wholly
unconstitutional, ill-advised and of no effect ;
therefore
Resolved, That we, members of the Execu
tive Committee of California State Typogra
phical Union No. 6, declare the said action
unconstitutional and oi no lorcc or effect
wnateyer; aud iurther
Resolved, That we deeply reeret the action
thus taken and the unfortunate events that
have since transpired, and express the hope
that harmony may once more be ml iy restored.

EXCURSION TO BOHEMIA.
Special Trains Will Carry Parties to the
Guerneville Redwood Groves.
An outing in the big tree grove is always
popular. People like to get away from the
City occasionally in search of change of
scene and air, and the redwood foreat has
a charm that attracts large numbers of
people. The beautiful grove on the Rus
sian River, three miles below Guerneville,
known as Bohemia, the scene of the recent
Bohemian Club's high jinks, will have a
special train next Sunday, (September 6,
when the people will have an opportunity
to spend four hours there, at the low rate
for the round trip of $1 25.
The excursion will be personally con
ducted by Mr. Locke, which is a guarantee
of good service. G. W. Morgan, proprietor
of El Bonita Hotel, Duncans Mills, will
serve a grill lunch as soon as the train ar
rivef.and will give the visitors a good meal,
served ia genuine Bohemian style. The
pany will leave by a special steamer via
Tiburon ferry at 8:30 a. m., this hour being
arranged as more convenient than the
regular boat that goes earlier. Reserved
seat tickets on the train can be secured
daily until 9p. m. at the office, 333 O'Far
rell street. Tickets for unreserved cars
can be had at the ferry on application to
Mr. Locke. Tickets are not for sale at the

MORE SOCIALISTS
UNDER ARREST.
Their Silent Open-Air Mass-
Meeting Badly Broken
Up.
SENT OFF TO PRISON.
O.'ficer Whelan Secures a Crowd
and Threatens to Use
His Club.
HE MAKES A FORCIBLE SPEECH
Mottoes Carried in a Parade After tbe
Seventh-Street Gathering Was
Dispersed.
The Socialists' attempt to hold an open
air meeting on the corner of Seventh and
Market streets was not a success last even
ing owing to the leaders being arrested for
disturbing the peace. The whole affair
was curious in the extreme, inasmuch as
there was no speaking and no demonstta
tion. In fact it was the most silent as
semnJage that ever gathered upon the
streets.
Several weeks ago those in charge of the
Odd Fellows' building complained to the
police that the public speaking of the Sal
vation Army and the Socialists on Seventh
street, near the corner of Market, dis
turbed the lodge meetings in the building.
The Salvation Army moved away when
directed to do so, but the Socialists con
tinued to hold open-air meetings there
and expound socialistic doctrines. This
resulted in the arrest of several speakers
for disturbing the peace and one was con
victed. The case will be appealed.
These proceedings caused the Socialists
to determine to see how far the officials
would go in breaking up their open-air
meetings. They decided to hold what
they called an "open-air silent mass
meeting," a gathering at which no one
was to speak or in any way disturb the
peace of any one.
They prepared nearly 100 banners, on
which were painted the mottoes and prin
ciples of the party.
Last evening about twenty members of
the San Francisco section went to Sev
enth and Market streets provided with
half a dozen torches. In the party was a
large sprinkling of students from the Le
land Stanford Jr. University and a couple
of professors of that coil ge. Several of
the students were ladies, whose dress,
manners and general appearance spoke
volumes in their favor. A small express
wagon containing the mottoes passed
slowly up and down Seventh street so as
not to obstruct the thoroughfare.
Albert Everett, the Socialist candidate
for Mayor, William Edlin, S. Seiler,
Mark Leitis, H. Strumsky and others
took a banner and marched into
the center of the small gath
ering. C. Sunflower stepped upon a
small footstool and held over his head a
banner bearing the mottoes "To discuss I
public matters is a misdemeanor" and "We
have been muzzled." The torches were
held so that all could read the inscriptions.
Not a word was spoken.
Th* next banner tv be raised read, "This
is an Odd Fellows' idea of a public meet
ing" and "Speakers should be seen and
not heard." Another read, "Free press.
Free speech" and "Don't make a noise.
This is the new way to discuss political
economy and public matters."
This strange, Quaker- like gathering
caused a few pedestrians to stop, read and
pass on, wondering what it all meant.
For ten minutes this was kept up, and
the meeting would probably have been a
failure so far as numbers were concerned
but for the advent of the police. Up to
this point there was room enough in the
street for two teams to pass abreast and at
least half of the sidewalk was clear and
practically unobstructed. Officer Wnelan,
who patrols Seventh street, had been lying
in wait on the corner of Mission. He then
forced his way through the small crowd
up to where Sunflower stood on the box.
"Come, get out of here! Move on!"
commanded the officer in a loud voice â
the first voice heard at the meeting.
â¢â¢Why should I move on?" asked Sun
flower quietly.
"Because I say bo. Move on, I say,"
answered Whelan. His voice attracted
the attention of those passing on Market
street, and in a few minutes he bad an
audience that blocked the street and side
walks from building to building. "Come,
get a move on, or I'll run you in," re
sumed the only speaker, to which the
colored socialist quietly answered, "I am
not breaking any law by standing on the
street. I will not move on."
But be did, in the custody of the pre
vious speaker, Officer Whelan. Sun
flower was taken to the Southern police
station and charged with disturbing the
peace.
Leon Brown quickly took the other's
place on the little box and waved two
banners, but said not a word. Tbe crowd
waited to see what would come next. It
was in the shape of tbe police patrol
wagon and several officers. Again Officer
Wheian acted as master of ceremonies,
and made his little speech to the silent ex
ponent of socialism. Brown was hustled
into the patrol wagon with his banners.
By the time the officer returned he
found Manuel Botana on the box. The
same dialogue and the same result fol
lowed. A. Delarocbe next took tbe stand
and then his seat in the patrol wagon.
By this time the street was vacked by
people attracted by the police and the
patrol wagon. Officer Whelan ordered the
crowd that he bad caused to assemble to
disperse, and several socialists protested
against moving until he threatened to
club them. The outside crowd hooted
and hissed, but the socialists called upon
them to keep tht> peace.
This was, in fact, the first address made
by the socialists. The latter gathered
farther down the street, intending to
march after the patrol-wagon to the police
station, but the driver forced his team
through the crowd and drove down Mar
ket street. A snort time later the prison
ers were bailed out, their bail beine $20
each. All were charged with disturbing
the peace. The socialists who wero in line
were prohibited from standing on the
street, so they marched down Market
street, carrying their banners, which con
tained tbe following mottoes:
"All who love liberty and justice and have
tbe courage of their convictions, fail into
line."
"Socialism is keeping war out of Europe to
day."
"We want better conditions, not harder
woric. "
"Schemers grow rich, while labor starves."

"With cup,, ai.Mn it is heads I win and tails

"Man first; property next."
"Are you a socialist? If not, why not?"
"Wealth, poverty and crime are on the in
crease. Why ?"
"The people should be the only monopo
lists."
"Socialism ig perfect democracy."
"Free men do not buy or beg a job."
"In 1776 no tramps; in 189t> 5,000,000."
"If you want work buy a job."

"Do you know why you are so poor ? Read
â¢Merrie England 1 and find out."
"The wnges of labor is death."
"The right to employment is prior to all
other rights-"
"Workingmen unite. You have nothing to
lose but your chains and the world to gain."
Karl Mafx.
"We want socialism in otir time."
"Two kinds of slaveryâ chattel and wage
slavery."
"Labor is poor. Why? Because it Is not
fully paid."
"Liberty when you work for a master."
"If Jeflerson could see the present Democ

"Workingmen, who owns the militia ? Who

"The increase of labor-saving machines
turns the workhorse into canned meat and its
monopolization turns the workman into a
tramp."
'Political liberty is impossible without in
dustrial freedom."
"Guns and charity cannot save the Nation."
"To control nature's resources is a crime."
"Work and vote for the co-operative com

"The right to earn a living should- not de
pend upon the whim or caprice of a private
employer."
"Only under socialism can the interests of
labor and capital be identical."
"Monopoly is the ripe fruit of competition."
The socialists marched to Market and
Kearny streets and back to the Mint steps.
The students from Stanford, ladies in
cluded, were in the procession, and all
were highly indignant at the treatment
they had received at the hands of the po
lice. On the Mint steps tbe speakers gave
vent to their feelings and were c eered by
the crowd. The sidewalk and street were
crowded to tbe cartracks, and, although
several police were in the neighborhood,
no attempt was made to interfere with the
speakers or even to keep the sidewalk
clear.
TO TRAIN SPEAKERS.
A College of Sociology to Be Es-
tablished by the So
cialists.
A proposition to establish a training
school of oratory and discussion, to qualify
speakers for the stump and lecture plat
form, was discussed recently at the busi
ness meeting of the literary branch,
Socialist - Labor party, and was unani
mously approved. Similar schools have
been in operation in many of the Eastern
cities and resulted in developinga corps of
able speakers and debaters, who have be
come a potent factor in the movement in
tbe East.
The coming campaign, as well as the
continuous propaganda work of Hie party
in this City and throughout the State,
necessitates the constant use of a well or
ganized and effective corps of speakers.
The school will open for its first educa
tional meeting next Friday night, and will
be continued indefinitely.

mittee, announced an address on Wednes
day, September 2, by Hon. Frank J. Mu
rasky.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 30, 1896.
SEEKS A WAY
TO CUT EXPENSES
The Traffic Association May
Combine With Another
Body.
PRESENT COST IS HIGH
Alliance May Be Effected With
One of Three Organ
izations.
A COMMITTEE WILL DECIDE.
Subject Matter Will Come Up for
Consideration at This Week's
Regular Meeting.
The resignation of Manager Curtis of the
Traffic Association will possibly lead to a
change in the manner of conducting the
business of the association. The members
were entirely satisfied with Mr. Curtis.
He having decided to go to Japan in the
interest of several San Francisco business
houses there has arisen, coincidently with
the consideration of the appointment of
bis successor, some discussion as to
whether it is necessary for the present to
keep up the existing scale of expenses,
which amount to about $800 per month.
There is no desire to abandon the iden
tity of the organization nor to permit it to
lapse so that it would be difficult to revive
it whenever occasion might demand. At
the same time many members think that
the Traffic Association may well be com
bined, for a time at least, with the Cham
ber of Commerce, the San Francisco Board
of Trade or the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association.
Some of the members advocate a
union with the Chamber of Commerce,
and the employment of Captain William
L. Merry, secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce, as manager. Others favor
union with the San Francisco Board of
Trade, and there are also strong advocates
of an alliance with tbe Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association. The main
purpose is to save expense and to make
the total outlay not to much exceed $150
per month.
To do this the force of clerks and sten
ographers now employed at the Traffic
Association office at 214 Pine street would
necessarily be discharged.
The whole subject matter will come up
for discussion at the regular monthly
meeting of the executive committee of the
association next Wednesday. The execu
tive committee has power to finally decide
what will be done, being empowered by
the constitution of the association with
full control of the administration ot the
association's affairs.
The association had for its first manager
Joseph S. Leeds, who was succeeded by
Mr. Curtis, when Mr. Leeds went to St.
Louis to take a position with the St. Louis
Merchants' Association.
Captain Merry, who may be selected as
manager, while still retaining his position
with the Chamber of Commerce, has been
a member of the Traffic Association from
its organization, and was the president of
the North American Navigation Company,
â¢vhich for a time nan an independent line
of steamers, in connection with the Panama
Ra lroad Company, between this City and
Panama, as a part of the through-sea route
between San Francisco and New York.
THE NINTH AT STOCKTON
Programme of tbe Admission Day
Celebration of the
N. S. O. W.
The joint committee of the 9th of Sep
tember Stockton celebration met last
evening at Native Sons' Hall to hear the
reports of the different sub-committees.
Eugene Levy, chairman of the room com
mittee, stated that tbe requests for lodg
ings at Stockton during the two days'
festivities were coming in slowly and it
behooved those who had not yet secured
their loduings to do so immediately.
The chairman of tbe advertising com
mittee stated that he desired to suspend a
banner across Market street, but had been
informed that such would uot be permit
ted by the City authorities. However, he
had seen a large political banner stretched
over that thoroughfare and he would as
certain whether the Native Sons could
have tbe same privilege.
A notice had appeared in the news
papers that a $2 50 round-trip rate had
been secured from the railroad for the
members of the order. This was incorrect,
us the rate bad been secured for ail who
desired to attend the celebration from San
Francisco.
Chairman Pistolesi of the parade comm
ittee reported that they could have red
fire and bombs for the parade to take place
in this City at 7 o'clock in the evening of
September's.
Grand Marshal Van Orden reported
that the parade would be in four divisions,
in charge of L. C. Pistolesi of Sequoia
Parlor, John Porcher of Mission. Henry
Stern of California, and D. J. Ellis of
South San Francisco Parlor. Chief
Crowley has promised to have a police
escort for the procession on its march
down Market street to the ferry, all of the
officers to be Native Sons.
The following is the programme of the
celebration at Stockton:
September Bâ Afternoon, reception to
incoming parlors; evening, grand torch
light procession, on arrival of San Fran
cisco parlors. Grand open-air concert,
8:30 to II o'clock.
September 9â Morning parade will start
at 10 o'clock sharp. Literary exercises at
Yosemite Theater immediately alter the
parade. Bicycle races at Good water Grove
at 1:30 p. jf! sharp. ChampionsuiD re
patta on Stockton channel at 3:30.' Grand
water carnival on Stockton channel at

known in the order as something very
elaborately funny.
SALARIES TO BE PAID.
Treasurer Widber Has Found a "Way
Out of a Threatened Shortage in
Municipal Funds.
Treasurer Widber has been lying awake
nights to find some way out of the threat
ened shortage in the municipal funds that
bid fair to cause many City employes to
have recourse to the money brokers dur
ing the next sixty days to -get their war
rants and he has outwitted the dilemma.
After figuring up tlie amounts that will
fall due on Tuesday, the surplus carried
over from last year and the amounts in
the sinking and public buildings funds
Mr. Widber concluded that he could bor
row enough from tne latter two funds to
pay ail warrants, including teachers, when
presented. This money will be replaced
when taxes begin to come in.
THE F AIR TO BE OPENED
Speeches and Music at the
Columbia Theater Tuesday-
Night.
Many of the Exhibitors Object to the
High Bandstand in the
Pavilion.
The Home Products Fair will be opened
with a programme of >peeches and music
at the Columbia Theater Tuesday even
ing, September 1. As the occasion will
celebrate the first combination of the
Mechanics' Institute with the Manufiic
turers and Producers' Association for the
purpose of showing the number and di
versity of California products, something
| better than the ordinary is promised in
the openiug exercises, which will be aa
follows:
March and Cortege from ''Queen of Sheba"
(Gounod); address, President E. A. Denicke;
"Torreador and Andaluse" (Rubinstein ;
soprano solo, '-Waiting" (Miilnrd). Miss
Jeannette Coleman; introduction to third act
of "Lohengrin" (Wagner); Knickerbocker
Male Quartet, "In Silent Mead" (Emerson),
D. M. Lawrence, R. P. Evans, D. B. Crane, L. A.
Larsen: oration, James D. Phelau. Esq.;
reverie (Vieuxtenips); ..citation, ''At Long
Branch," Miss Lillian Dhu; overture, "North
Star" (Meyerbeer).
A number of the exhibitors have ob
jected to the high bandstand placed in the
middle of the Pavilion, claiming that it
obstructs the view and is out of place.
This is the way tbe subject has been pre
sented to the board of directors of the
Mechanics' Institute:
Gentlemen: The undersigned exhibitors
beg to submit to you that in their opinion the.
â¢high bmi'Uttiiid in the main aisle is detri
mental to thft best interests of many exhibi
tors and therefore indirectly to the fair in
general, and to request you that said band
stand be cut down so that the floor shall not
be over two feet above the floor of the hall.
Our opinion and request are based on the
following considerations:
Firstâ The height of the stand oDscures al
most completely the view of exhibits from
any side to people on the other side. This
means that all the exhibits along the main
aisle as well as many other exhibits within
fifty feet oi this bandstand are robbed of a
more or less large percentage of visibility and
conspicuou.'-ness.
Secondâ lt has a depressing effect on all ex
hibits in the viciuitj, gives the impression
that the band is more important than the ex
hibits, instead of serving merely to enhance
their advertising value.
Thirdâ lt spoils the effect ot the main aisle,
depriving it to a great extent of the sweeping,
impressive view tiiat would be otherwise ob
tained at tbe entrance to the hall.
Fourthâ lt will be at best an unsigntly ob
ject as compared with the surroundings, and
therefore look out of place; hence it is our
firm belief that it should be cut down so as
not so appear a prominent structure, thrown
in among and overshadowing the exhibits,
but merely a slightly raised platform, so that
the view of spectators will extend uninter
ruptedly across the heads of musicians to ex
hibits and parts of the hall on the opposite
end or side.
Knowing that you, gentlemen, are as sin
cerely interested in the success of the exhib
itors as they are themselves we feel that you
will cheerfully grant our petition. Johuson-

terday, "one would think I was preaching
Populism. Bin everybody knows my po
litical platform. Until a womah can vote
she cannot be properly be called Populist,
Republican or Democrat. I am sure no
one will mistake oiy present political atti
tude."
A Good* Overcoat Gone.
While Walter N. Brunt, a printer at 535 Clay
street, was upstairs at work last nignt thieves
broke the glass door into the pressroom and
stole from the office a new $45 overcoat. Since
another robbery there six yuars ago no money
has been kept in the safe over night. Mr.
Brunt's coat and vest, necktie and diamond
pin lay on the table, but were overlooked by
the tnieves. Nothing else was missed last
night.

KORESHAN TEED
HAS RETURNED,
He Says Eastern News
papers Have Lied Fear
fully About Him.
HAS BEEN DOING RIGHT
"Never Broke Up a Family
Anywhere in All My
Life."
BIG COLONY IN FLORIDA:
He Tells of the Progress of the Teed
Religion in D.fferent Parts of
the Country.
Dr. Cyrus R. Teed, the celibate, whose
institutions are in Chicago, Florida and
other sections, and who had an institution
here some three years a o, since which
time he has been in Chicago, arrived here
last night and is at tbe Palace.
He left Chicago several weeks ago and
has been stopping off in several places on
his way west. He claims to have about
100 followers yet in San Francisco and is
out to look after them. How long he. will
stay, he says, is a little uncertain.
"I etopped off at Denver, Colorado
Springs, Cripple Creek, Salt Lake and
Sacramento," said he. "I might say a
good deal about the progress of the faith I
represent, but the newspapers have
treated me so harshly everywhere that I
don't care whether I do or not.
"If it is of interest, though, I might say
we have a colony of about 200 on the gulf
in Florida and a colony of about 100 in
Ch'cago. Besides these we have little
communities in different parts of the
country, We have a church in Denver
and several different churches elsewhere.
The work is progressing. We have a few
people here, and I probably will interest
others.
"It is, true that we are a religious and
commercial community. We believe in
the Christian religion; believe that the Bi
ble is inspired. But we are not orthodox.
We don't believe as a good many of the de
nominations do.
"Of course, we are in favor of celibacy
for both sexes. We believe it is the key
to immortal life.
"But if celibacy is a crime, we cannot be
woise than one great church. Still this ig
regarded as one of our offenses. We
haven't quite as much backing, and there
fore we must suffer, I suppose.
"Our colony in Florida is flourishing,
and I think we will build up quite a town
there. It hps an excellent harbor, is in
an orange belt below the frost line and
people are coming there right along to
locate and become part of us. We have
several mills and other enterprises started.
The colony is in Lee County.
"We have two orders. One is called the
celibate order and the other the marital.
With the latter people are united in mar
riage by law and live as they ordinarily
do, the" children being reared together.
The celibate, however, is a higher order
and the people enjoy special privileges.
"It is false to say that I ever broke up
â any families. I have seen those charges
repeatedly in the papers, but they are all
untrue. 1 have been charged with break
ing up families! have never seen.
"One man in Unicago, whose wife had
been divorced from him for eight years,
charged me with breaking- up his family,
and I had never even met his wife. I re
member the same charge was made with
other families. All the stories were un
true.
"When I went to the papers they
wouldn't correct them, and I let them go.
If I had been worth a million dollars in
stead of being poor I would have sued
them. They are lies pure and simple that
ll:ey have been telling."
Dr. Teed was engaged in conversation
with two ladies who had called to meet
him for some moments after his arrival.
He is smooth-shaven, dresses in black, his
Prince Albert coat being closely buttoned.
His hair is getting a little thin, and in one
place baldness has set in.

THERE are two Southern Pacific em
ployes who work on the Alameda
narrow-gauge local who will not be so
vociferous in the cause of silver in the fu
ture, however mucn they may be in favor
of the white metal.
Tom Davis is a conductor and John
Santine a brakeman, and both are as in
terested in the financial problem â as in
fact are all their fellow-trainmen â as any
one in this country. They both believe
in silver, ana since the big conventions
declared their platforms have argued the
matter with the other employes, most of
whom are gold men, whenever an oppor
tunity offered. ' No argument would con
vince them, and the trainmen who held
different views determined to have some
sport at their expense.
The paycar was due last Saturday, and
some of the boys saw the cashier ahead of
time and arranged a little surprise for
Davis and Santine. When their names
were called they stepped briskly forward
to receive their welcome salary, the for
mer with his demand for $105 and the
latter for $65. Th ir surprise may be
imagined when they were confronted with
shining piles of silver aggregating the
lull amount of their salaries. Santine
took his medicine philosophically, and,
having capacious pockets, stored the sil
ver away without a word.
Davis was not so fortunate in the way
of pockets, and after asking for gold and
being blandly informed that the supply
was about exhausted, he made an effort to
induce some of his fellow-trainmen to
take some of his load. It had been agreed
beforehand not to help out the silver men,
and he finally had to get a valise to take
home his wages.
In future Davis and Santine will prob
ably talk less of silver to the Southern
Pacific employes, but when the spirit
moves confide their tribulations to a blue
coated guardian of the peace.
AN UNCOMMON BOY
HERE is a street occurrence which
shows that true gallantry and fine
feeling is not entirely a thing of the past.
It was about 10 o'clock when a well
dressed, manly little chap came along
'and boarded the dummy of a Geary- street
car that was standing on the turntable.
He was within five feet of the baskets of a
number of flower merchants. A little girl
in charge of an old lady, both of them
very poorly dressed, stopped near the
baskets and looked longingly at the
bunches of fragrant color.
"Oh. can't 1 have some flowers?" asked
the child, but the old lady sadly shook
her head, after examining a lean-looking
purse. "Please, only a little bunch; just
this time," pleaded the little child; but in
vain.
They moved slowly away while the
little boy on the car went through his
pockets. All he could find was a 10-cent
piece. He looked at it several moments,
and was once on the point of putting it
back in his pocket, then quickly jumped
off the car and exchanged it for a bunch
of flowers.
The little girl looked back and wanted
the flowers more than ever. Before she
could realize just how it all happened the
boy ran forward and pressed the flowers
into her hands. Th re was no time to
refuse them or even to stammer out
thanks, for the boy quickly turned and
started to walk home out Geary street.
WHITE GIRLS OR CHINESE AS SERVANTS?
Why do we hate our Celestial broth er,
we of the workaday world? Tiie mission
ary tells us it is ungodly. Perhaps it is,
but why not accord white girls at least
equal rients in the field of labor? , There
might not then be so extensive a China
town or so , many imported slaves for the
zealous missionary to rescue.
Quite apart from the question of busi
ness rivalry between white laborers and
Chinese and more humiliating to a white
working girl is the risk of being brought
into daily contact with these heathen and
made in a measure subservient to them.
â¢ My. first experience in this line was com
paratively mild. Entering a luxurious
mansion upon the heights, I was ushered
into the boudoir of a grand dame, who
wished some one to wait upon her and
take charge of her young infant. "I have
a splendid China boy, who attends to
everything else," said this languid and
elegant lady. "You will have nothing
whatever to do aside from these light
duties." . â jjHH^^^^H^^^H
The wages she of- I
ered were scarcely in I
keeping with the ap- I
point men ts .' of her I
menage, but I agreed I
to enter her service. I
Monsieur was a swell I
and indolent - attor- I
ney, . whose . lavish I
tastes were supplied I
from .ber bank ac I
count, and such feasts I
as graced their board I
were treats to be re- I
membered. Break- I
fast was served in I
five courses, and din- I
ncr "fas equal to a I
Government func-B
tion. I not infre- I
quently presided in I
solitary state at the I
latter meal, for the I
mistress was served I
in her boudoir, and I
the affable host was I
quite ant to be late. I
The Cnina boy wait- I
ed . upon me most I
ceremoniously and I
watched - for the ef I
ects of his truly won- I
derful â  entrees and I
desserts. But he wa^^^o^^g^^p^^^Q
geance in his wicked little heart. , One
morning the beds were not made.
â¢ "Charlie has so much to do that he
can't get , around to â  this," said i madame,
"You had better prepare , the rooms for
sweeping also since it is Friday."
: That was : ; the beginning. -A: few days
later, when she descended to dine . with
her lord, she said that Charlie's dusting
was not what it might be and that I ough
always to go over the rooms after him.
The demands of the all-important baby
scarcely admitted of . this, ; for human ills
were his in abundance. Science and affec
tion united in strenuous efforts to relieve
his suffering, but. nothing seemed to bring
him- happiness. Mathematical precision
in hygienic matters could not have . been
carried to - greater â  lengths.'. Everytnine
pertaining , to . the t infant's . welfare - was

ceremony that " ; is ' observed in \ the royal

of regret and consternation to the dis
tracted parents tbat he refused to regulate
his hours of sleeping and wailing (his sole
occupations) by the official programme.
All this would have been amusing if it
had not been wearisome. It left me no
leisure at best, and now I silently took up
the dusting-cloth, while the washing waited
ana the cherub squirmed threateningly in
his carriage. Having impressively incul
cated the principles of charity and sub
missiveness milady passed on to the
kitchen, where she praised the slovenly
cook to the skies. Much gratified, he con
fided to her his longing to visit his native
land and his fears of being unable to return
to this country under the existing laws.
In answer I heard her say : "Oh, that's all
right. You shall come back to us, Charlie.
My husband is a lawyer, you know. He'll
fix all that for you." And conscious of
having lightened a fellow-mortal's burden
she resumed her easy-chair and ordered
the baby brought to her for inspection. j
"I would like my breakfast, now, Char
lie, please," I said the next morning in my
accustomed respectful tone.
"You wait!" snapped the little imp vi
ciously. "I no fix him now. Too much
allee time work."
I silently retired up the Dack stairs,
while the "herâ lump, herâ lump" of his
clumsy shoon resounded emphatically
over the oaken floor, and he slammed a
f lish into the oven with a fervor that
threatened to sunder even celestial ties.
"The chambcrwork wa^ not properly at
tended to yesterday," said madarne from
among her pillows. "It can't be expected
of Charlie when there is a second girl."
My labor was now nearly doubled and
my was-es still less than half what the
heathen's were. The infant's constant
demands, the daily washing, the elaborate
preparation of his food and the chamber
work for guests more than filled the day,
and at the end of it I quietly informed my
aristocratic mistress that unless she was
willing to pay proper wages for my extra
services I should not remain.
"Why, I have called you 'Miss' and
allowed you to eat in the dining-room!"
She expostulated faintly from her refuge
of eider-down quilts and hot-water bottles.
LHnies were dear to her heart, and as she
lackadaisically wilted I left her and re
turned to the unhappy cherub in the
cradle. As if seized with a presentiment
the master of the house hastened home
early that evening, and, coming at once
to the dining-room, generously offered to
raise my wages 66 per cent, at the same
time urging that I say nothing to his be
loved wife about the transaction. "It
might worry her." The circumstances of
this offer were so amusing that 1 con
sented to stay the remainder of the month,
and it was not until the date of my leav
ing, when the outwitted hostess saw her
cherished ducats heapeil in the palm of
my hand, that she realized our perfidy.
Only once more did I attempt the role
of nursemaid, and here I found myself
in all respects of secondary importance to
the Celestial cook.
"You will eat in the kitchen," said the
aristocratic young matron, who was a
Philadelphian. I had put her stupid,
overgrown youngster to bed, and was in
vestigating the pigeonholes of an old
desk she said I might use. Bnt I had
expected such dampers as this and
laughed in my sleeve as I shut the desk
and slowly descended the stairs to join the
heathen, who was singing to himself in a
guttural voice some weird Oriental love
melody while hÂ« cleared the table. But
he proved quite as aristocratic as his mis
tress. He greeted my advent with an
angry snort, and proceeded to set botn the
kitchen tables wit i unnecessary clatter
and ostentation. Jerking a chair into place
for me, he retired to his own seat, with
his back to me, and "fell to," leaving me
unmolested. Had it not been for the un
pleasant sounds of his eating, I could
have fancied myself dining in the solitary
grandeur I had known in the mansion
upon the heights.
A day or so later I had the pleasure of
overhearing a confidential chat between
mistress and heathen, in which my fail
ings were freely discussed. Being unac
customed to such a position, I had not at
first realized just the degree of self-abase
ment and tireless industry in matters
quite apart from baby-tending that was
requisite to securing the approbation of
my two distinguished critics. A thousand
household duties were to be scrupulously
attended to, while the mischief-seeking
youngster was yet not to be neglected for
the fraction ,of a second nor the China
man's delicate sensibilities in any way
offended. I soon felt that I could never do
justice to her Philadelphian ideas nor to
her Celestial confidant, who wa3 much re
lieved when I resigned my charge.
Far from the madding crowd at an
ideal mountain resort I sought equality
and justice, and incidentally waited on
table. The novel conception of equality
which prevailed in thai hotel kitchen I
shall never forget. As for justice, that
followed. I had successfully manipulated
the enormous tray, yfith its uncompromis
ing wei ht of indestructible crockery, for
the space of an hour and a half, and had
almost mastered the lingo of the Oriental
cook, whose pronunciation of fancy French
dishes was unique and inimitable. I
was standing at the stove and prepar
ing a cup of weak tea for an invalid
boarder, when a moist and caressing hand
was insinuated beneath my chin. My
blood ran cold.
The heathen was standing directly be
hind me, and a conciliatory gurgle es
caped his lips. The cup in my hand was
half filled with hot water, and quick as a
thought I turned and da3hed it in his
face. The howl of consternation which
this sally evoked gave evidence that my
anarchist spirit was a new element in his
domain. Tears came to his eyes and he
fled to the back steps to relieve his feel
ings. I reported my adventure at the land
lord's table later on, and this was tbat
gentleman's only reminder: "It was a
dangerous thing for you to do; you might
have injured the Chinaman's eyesieht."
The heathen himself next morning
broached the subject in this wise: "What
for you no likee Chinaman all same white
man?"
It was useless to explain to him that
even a white cook would not be accorded
such privileses; he was convinced that it
was a narrow-minded prejudice on my
part. Perhaps it was.
"Montana girl heap likee Chinaman;
Montana girl heap high-toned," he con
tinued didactically.
Heaven defend the Montana girls! I
looked into the bread-bin and busily rat
tled my dishes. â

contemptuously, and turned bacK to his

WHISTLES ALL DAY
NOT many years since the musical
capacity of feminine puckered lips
first burst upon the astonished and listen
ing world of moderns. Until that labial
discovery the old-time saying that
"whistling girls and crowing hens are
sure to come to some bad ends" was ac
cepted to be as true as "thirty days hath
September." Since then audiences have
sat enchanted while young women imi
tating the skylarK have whistled roulades
and cadenzas and "lema con variatione"
ad lib. True it is in all lines tbat the
championship is an uncertain possession
and just now the best whistler in San
Francisco is not a lady, but is one of
Uacle Sam's letter-carriers who whistles
in the streets, in corridors and offices and
would undoubtedly whistle at lunch and
when he is asleep if he were not otherwise
engaged. Two yean ago the ease with
which he could whistle high and low
notes was observed. Since then he has
practiced on th>; average at least eight
hours per day and has acquired tones
which might easily be mistaken for the
reedy clarionet or the woody flute and his
repertoire has widened until it takes in
everything from "Old Dan Tucker" to a
florid paraphase of "Semiramide" and the
"Prize Song" from "Der Meistersinger,"
varied with "Two Little Girls in Blue"
and some recent tunes. This whistling
letter-carrier is oue of the best-known
characters in the area which he traverses
daily. When he is not whistling on his
rounds he sings, but his vocal efforts are
confined to houses and are not for street
use.
A DIVING DOG
ACK is only three years old, but he has
a record of having dived from a height
of more than seventy feet. Jack is a
dog, and is a native son, having been born
in Alameda. He was first the property of
Dana Thompson, the weil-unown diver,
and under him t6ok his first lessons in the
aquatic sport. He is now owned by Pro
fessor May Gay, also a natatorial performer
of prominence. It was under his present
master's tuition that Jack developed his
remarkable talent for hieh diving.
This canine wonder is a cross between a
Scotch and a Skye terrier, and first came
into notice at the baths along the Alameda
shore. He appears to thoroughly enjoy
his distinction, and his performances are
marked with all the airs and affectation
of the experienced circus acrobat.
He ascends to his aerial post at a word
from his trainer, but will not undertake
the leap into the water except on hearing
the report of a pi3tol. In most cases dogs
who make exceptionally high dives have
to be pushed off, but Jack is not of this
kind. At the signal he gazes down into
the water to see if the locality is clear of
all objects. Should there be some one in
the way Jack's bark warns 1 the individual
of his intrusion. Tne way having been
cleared, Jack throws his shaggy little head
from one side to the other, as if saluting
the audience, leaps off and invariably
strikes the water head first.
Jack is billed to appear at the benefit to
be given to the members of the California
Swimming Club at the Sutro baths on
next Wednesday evening. He is the mas
cot of the club.

A HOUSE PARTY AT WILLOWMERE IN SURREY
WILLOWMERE, England, Aug. 7.â
Tbe invitation was the first source of
contention. The envelope was addressed
to Mrs. Blanke; the letter within was
couched in terms to be accepted, we were
sure, in the widest and most liberal sense.
â¢'Of course," said Mrs. Blanke to ncr
husband, "he includes you; and he can
not expect me to leave Tommy at homeâ
and if Tommy goes I can't be bothered
witb him, and I must have Marie."
"He" was our host, and tbe owner of a
cottage in Surrey ; he had once suggested
a visit upon some nebulous future occa
sion, and had been delicately reminded of
it at every opportunity. The result was
not entirely satisfactory.
Every member of tbe heterogeneous
family could call to mind moments of
elucidation, in which the invitation had
been addressed individually to her. Mrs.
Whitehat explained that the term "cot
tage" in England was not to betaken too
literally; it was not of necessity modestly
limited to one room, a livin'-room, a
settin'-room, a drawin'-room and a dinin'
room, with an attic in which a corner
would have to be chipped from each article
of furniture in order to close the doors and
windows.
Mrs. Whitehat had culled her informa
tion from the most reliable sources. Her
literary associations were of the most re
fined and highbred character. "The
Duchess" had established an unalterable
bucolic ideal in her mind, from which no
self-respecting country house could depart.
The party assembled at the station con
sisted of Mr. and Mrs. Blanke, Master
Tommy, Master Tommy's inseparable
playmates, two doves in a capacious
wicker cage; Master Tommy's maid
"Marie," called "The Bun" by Mrs.
Whitehat, who had spent a week in Paris;
Mrs. Whitehat herself and the unscrupu
lous journalist. The luggage consisted of
six trunks, foor satchels, the above
mentioned doves, a black bottle with milk
for Tommy, a paper bag of soft cracker?
and sundry packages containing articles
that had been gathered up at the last mo
ment.
Ouriost, Mr. Langbam Graves, arrived
a few moments before the departure of
the train. His attire was "neat but not
gaudy," and his modest handbag and an
overcoat suggested, perhaps, an elegant
simplicity, but not that multiplicity of
tennis and boating and dinner costumes
Mrs. Whitehat nad implied from his.gen
eral appearance and bad insisted upon
ONE TALE OF LATTER-DAY
WITCHCRAFT IN WHICH
THE POSSESSOR OF A
FEATHER-BED WAS HAUNTED
Btories of witchcraft are usually relegated to the middle ages, but occasionally an
interesting one is found in our own nineteenth century. Such a story comes from one
of tbe villages of Leicester, England, where one of the actors in the adventn/e is still
living, an old WeÃleyan preacher named Evans, whose integrity is unimpeachable.
Bet Charity, who lived in one of the midland counties about forty years ago, was
regarded by her neighbors with suspicion, and was called the old witch, though no
one was able to point to any particular act iD this line. In course of time she became
fatally ill, and on her deathbed she asked her husband to give her feather bed to her
daughter. Her husband promised to do so, but the eldest son would not permit him
to give the bed away during bis life, and on the father's death insisted that the bed
should be sold with the other furniture, and the proceeds divided between the chil
dren.
The bed was bought at the' sale by a Mrs. Bins, who thought she had not only got
a bargain but a luxury. It was placed on top of the other bed occupied by Mr. Bins
and his wife. But when the new owners retired to rest they found the featherbed
was not so soft and comfortable as they had expected; they could not rest on it, and
after some time they pitched it on the floor, Mrs. Bins remarking she would see what
made it so hard in morning. The next day she sent her little boy to a neighbor's to
play, telling him there was a lot of Bet Charity's bits of coal in the bed, and she was
going to pick them out. Tlie boy naturally told what his mother had said to him, and
the neighbors at once knew that it was Bet Charity's hoarded gold, not coal, that was
picked out.
The bed was again pnt on the bedstead and Bins and his wife retired at the usual
hour that night, remarking that the bed was more comfortable. They had not been
asleep long, however, when they were awakened by some one banging a boxlid down
with great force. Bins jumped out of bed at once, got a light and found that the box
was securely locked; he also found that nothing had been touched in it, to his great
relief. There was no more rest for them that night, nor any other night. As soon as
they got to sleep they were awakened by all kinds of strange noises they could not ac
count for. Tbe want of rest at last began to be very hard on Bins, so he told his min
ister, Rev. Evans. Bins said it was sometimes like a heavy cart going up and down
stairs; other times it wa3 like the drawers were pulled oat and banged with great
force. Evans' curiosity was aroused and he proposed that Mrs. Bins should sleep
with Mrs. Evans and he would sleep with Bins. The first two nights nothing hap
pened, bat tbe third night they heard the sound of a heavy horse coming upstairs.
They immediately jumped out of bed and turned on the light, but could see nothing
For two weeks nothing further was heard, so Evans concluded to go home. The first
night Mrs. Bins returned home the noise came back with redoubled fury.
Bins finally determined to visit a wizard who lived seven miles away, near Belvoir
Castle. He told him their troubles and said he and his wife thought it was Bet Char
ity come again. The wizard, whose name was Singleton, smiled and asked :
"Have you got anything of hers?"
"We bought her feather bed at the sale and have had no peace since."
"Have you got it now?"
"Yes; but it is not in the house. It has been for some weeks in a friend's bed
room."
"My man, does it not strike you that;it cannot be Bet Charity who causes thÂ«
noise? Whom does it affect the most?" *
Bins told him his wife was simply wasting to a shadow. The wizard replied
''You are quite right about the bed. That is what sbe is after, and yoa know as
well as Ido what she wants. But it is a living woman. No dead woman can trouble
you hke that. I can show you who it is in that glass. But yon have first got to prom
ise me that you will not tell your wile nor any one else about it. Or, if you will pay
tbe cost of that looking-glassâ two shillings and sixpence-I will give you a hammer
and you can strike her anywhere about the body; wherever you strike her you will
mark her. She has no power to touch you or she woulf have done so long ago All
the power she has is to annoy you." *
Bins refused to make the promise of secrecy, saying he had already promised to
tell Evans everything. "But cannot something be done to stop the annoyance?"
with that firm sweetness we knew too well
to combat.
In an hourâ little Tommy's exploits
had made it seem a week â we arrived at
our destination and had exchanged the
hot, sultry, smoky .London air for tbe
freshest, most exhilarating, pure-laden
atmosphere in England.
The village itself looked like a village
out of a comic opera; the ancient houses,
with gable windows set in the sunken
roofs or blinking under the eaves, were
overgrown with vines, clemat'3 and roses
and Virginia creepers. Tbe inhabitants
stood staring at our cavalcade with the
stupidity and mechanical movement of a
badly trained chorus. Every detail
seemed arranged with an eye for the pic
turesque eft set.
Mrs. Whitehat hid an acute disap
pointment in the stolidity of the
"yeomanry," as she had already termed
them in the letter she was mentally en
gaged in sending home to an impres
sionable and loquacious friend.
"They all dropped a curtsey as we
passed" was the wording she would have
chosen, "and Bulled their forelocks with
tbe deepest respect."
In reality one or two of the boldest and
least bow-leggea of tbe children ran after
us with feeble bowls and most disrespect
ful remarks addressed to Bathsheba
Florence, tbe patient donkey, who dragged
the basket cart with little Tommy cheering
and squawking like a cockatoo.
Our host pointed out the places of in-

terest scattered over the wide valley, in
closed by an irregular line of low hills that
melted into the sky. He also dilated upon
the absolute peace and quiet of the life to
which he was about to introduce as, the
uninterrupted placidity of the day.
Mrs. Whitehat looked out dreamily over
the hills dotted here and there with
ancestral castles, she had no doubt in the
world. This was the proper background
for those lawn parties and flirtation teas
and country balls and other rustic enter
tainments sue could have written about
with such eloquence.
"You have many neighbors?" she in
quired tentatively.
"Yes,'' replied -Mr. Graves, "that is Lord
Sandhill's place behind those trees â "
Mrs. Whitehat hastily straightened her
hat, she looked very cheerful indeed.
â¢'lt must be rather a bore," she remarked,
"to have to continue all your social duties
when you come down in order to get rid
of them â to â to lie fallow, so to speak
and â ana rest â and have real country
pleasures, cows and croquet and sunrises,
and â and â making cheese and thingÃ."
"Yes," laughed our host, "that is Just
my view of it. We never call and the
neighoors never call on us. There is an
asylum for convalescent lunatics in the
neighborhood, sometimes they come wan
dering in."
Mrs. Whitehat relapsed into a melan
choly silence.
The cottage was called Willowmere and
It certainly verified her prognostications.
It was large and old, with quaint windows
and hospitable doors. A riotous garden,
full of old-fashioned flowers and cat?, sur
rounded it â the old-fashioned flowers
were a gay rosemary and rue and phlox
and geranium and stick roses, dropping
leaves and leavings on the crisn grass.
The cats were a joy, too, chiefly to little
Tommy, who could be seen at any time
on the terrace, amicably compressing two
sprawling kittens on his infant - chest.
while savage miaows proceeded from
those upon whose tails he was always
stepping or from their infuriated parent.
George was the name of ihe infuriated
parent. His history was an appalling
record. He was regarded with some dis
favor and was not considered by his fam
ily U> have properly lived up to his voca
tion in life. He had been a fine kitten in
his youthâ the hopes entertained for his
personal appearance had be n rudely
dashed by his growing up a decidedly
plain cat.
He bad 'also been credited with gentle
manly feeling, and his continual habit of
having on an average four families a year
could not fail to be a grief to his would-be
admirers. His first family, which (perhaps
"Yes; you go home and clear everything out of the room but the bed ; have a scythe ready to lay your bands on, and when
you hear anything you must get out of bed instantly and swing the scythe about the room, and yon will strike tire against some
thing. When you have done that you can come back and tell me. You can have one friend sleep with you, but your wife had
belter sleep out of the house, an i you must be in the dark."
That night the friends retired as directed. They heard a slight noise and got up and used the scythe, but to no effect. The
next night at 10 o'clock they again heard the noise coming upstairs. Bins got out of bed at once and was ready as soon as it
reached the room, and with the first swing of the scythe he saw a spark of fire. Early next morning Bins went to the wizard, who
gave him a piece of blue taper with some stiange characters on it, telling him to make a hole over the bedroom door large enough
to bury it in, and then plaster it over. The wizard told him to do this before dark, and the witch would have no power to annoy
him as long as he (the wizard) lived.
The noise ceased, and the Bins had unbroken peace for two years, when suddenly the noise came back with greater fury
than ever. The wizard had died.
Mrs. Bins died one morning a few months later, and the neighbors said she wa3 haunted to death. Mr. Bins lived in the
bouse for lour years longer, but never heard anything more from the ghost. Then the dau-hter of Bet Charity died. She left a
letter to be given to Mr. Bins after her death, and in ie she confessed that she had paid an old woman named Polly Birch to haunt
the house. She also said that when Bins used the scythe he had cut Polly's band very badly. Sbe added that Polly was dead,
but that if she had been alive she would never bave told him.
FIGADORE AND HIS TIN CASTLE
The receipt arrest at Sonora, Tuolumne County, of the old
Mexican, Figad ore, on a charge of attempted murder, brings
into view one of the o ddest and most eccentric characters of the
mining regions. Old- Tuolu mne has known him since the days
of '49. During the early gold excitement be worked lor Sutter
and later on was in the employ of Captain Webber. His cabin'
which is located a few hundred yards below Sonora, alongside of
Sonora Creek, is made entirely of tin, excepting, of course the
rafters and corner-posts. A short distance up stream from the
cabin are 'the Sonora dumping-grounds, whence this dried-up
human relic, Figadore, gathers in tin cans of all descriptions.
These are piled into a bonfire, unsoldered and flattened out and
make material, without expense, for building purposes. This
cabin ot to-day is the third of the kind that Figadore has con
structed. The two others were built so near the middle of the
creek that tb^e angry winter flood? swept them away. But
Figadore is a persevering mortal. No sooner do the waves
break down his tin castle than he begins the slow and patient
work of collecting more tins, to be put together in the same old
owing to his education) seemed to come
as an unpleasant surprise to him, were con
cealed by him with commendable tact in
a remote corner of the wash'us, and were
there left to expire. After the first shock
he seemed to get accustomed to-the idea,
and subsequent families met with gender
treatment. But the confidence of George's
owners was shaken, and on the survival of
a small male kitten it was instantly
christened Jane Stella to prevent disap
pointment.
Mrs. Whitehat settled herself to the
contemplation of the scenery with com
mendable cheerfulness. She inspected
the gardens and the stables and the pig
gery and the hennery, and asked intelli
gent questions about the crops and the
cultivation of beans. She regarded the
cows with interest and listened to their
lowing as to sweetest music-.
I grieve to have to quote* again from an
unpublished letter to her friend:
'"The place is tenanted byjanimals; the
COW 3 never stopâ they bray from morn till
dewy eve and from dewy eve till dawn.
We play croquet on the lawn by ourselves
and change partners to add to the excite
ment. We smile at each other, but I could
crack those balls into the next yardâ if
there was a yard â as we go senselessly
hammering them about the lawn, Little
Tommy rolls about, and my only diversion
is whan he and one of a million cats and
the croquet-balls come into violent col
lision. We go out for carriage exercise in
the afternoons; the carriage is a basket
with room for two. Bathsheba Florence
is a donkey. Her family tree would be
quite an interesting document. Her im-
mediate ancestor must have been a cat.
She shows the most remarkable capacity
for climbing trees. Then, further, a terrier
dog. We were crossing the heather re
cently, a lonely moor on which a pensive
billygoat was straying. 'Sheba' gave a
snort. 'My lone lost brother,' she seemed
to ejaculate, kicked out her legs in every
direction and fled in hot pursuit Th^
billygoat treated her with scorn and con
tumely and fled likewise. Sheba was only
stopped in her wild career by the appear
ance of a rabbit, on which her tamer in
stincts awoke, and .she stopped as sud
denly as a clock, to brood over the hole in
which tbe bunny bad taken refuge. Tbe
men push the basket and the donkey
up all the hills and tbe legend that Batb
way. Even now bia neighbors are indulging in guesses as to
how long the new cabin will withstand tbe onslaughts of next
winter's swollen tides.
On Figadore'u creek-bottom soil peppers are tbe chif
things grown. He has every variety of pepper plants around
the cabin. It is, perhaps, a characteristic of his race that he
has a weakness for tamales and "chile con came," and the pep
pers are a most necessary ingredient of the hot Mexican pre
parations.
It is a pec uliar experience to be inside Figadore's tin cabin
during a hailstorm. The effect produced suggests, so to speak,
the noise of a Chinese new year celebration when enthusiasm is
at its height among tbe Celestials.
Ffgadore may have to close his career behind the walls of a
prison for his recent desperate deed, and his tin cabin, with its
mud chimney and smokestack attachments, together with his
pepper-ganlen, his bowlders, cobbles and brush, go rolling
downstream with next winter' 3 torrents, and a landmark and
its story be thus sent to join the hosts of traditions of the
Sonora mining regions.
sheba in moments of excitement has ac
quired the habit of falling flat on her face
lends a pleasing uncertainty to the situa
tion. Ab ! we spend our time in riotous
living! The country is interesting; there
is a lovely little cottage that dates back to
Edward VIII or somebody, and a number
of houses where somebody wrote some
thing or other, and other exciting bits of
information.
"The house itself is lovely. A maid
brings tea at an unearthly hour and drags
in a green and white footbath and two
cans or hot water. You can tell her ap
proach by the 'clashing of cymbals.'
The water is of a bright red. It is sup
posed to have healing powers. You take
it off with a towel. You have no idea
how fresh the air is and how 1 enjoy the
simple iiie, the calmness and the absence
of fatigue My dear, I hastily wrote
this sentiment, for our host was hunting
for a pen. I could hold my hand carefully
over the top of the letter, but I thought it
better not to pause." * * *
I hesitate to go farther with this
veracious chronicle.
The days pass. Mrs. Whitehat pervades
the gardens and walks. Her pose is one
of artless simplicity, in keeping with the
romantic solitude. She wears wreaths of
roses in her hair and carries a volume of
poems in her hand (and Ouida's latest in
her pocket!) She strokes the cats and

imagined something expectant â a Blight
watchfulness in her manner. It is im
possible to her idea that none of the
neighbors will call; that all these bucolic
merry-makings of which the standard
authors give such accurate descriptions
should be fictitious. Why doesn't the
curate call? And the vicar or the vicar's
unattractive daughters, who bring into
greater prominence the radiance of the
heroine? \Vhere is the young lad with a
magnificent estnte and an insane wife con
cealed about the premises? Where is the
Dook who blesses everybody in facetious
and familiar terms in tbe Jast chapter?
Alas! Mrs. Whitehead sits in the garden
and waits, or at the window and watches,
but no one conies except one brainless,
convalescent lunatic who is attracted by
the capstrinsrs of "the bun" and little
Tommy's innocent glee.'
On Sunday, however, she is rewarded at
Jast. A yoang man is seen in the distance,
the silver gleam of his bicycle may be
perceived leaning against the doorway to
"The Dog and Pheasant "Inn," where he
pauses to see the curious interior, the
quaint, dark, picturesque interior, full of
cider- jugs and beer.
He is not a Dook nor a curate, but Mrs.
Whitehat cares not for that. He is the
first male man she has seen for five days,
with the exception of our host, on whom
her simple and nnaffected gayety has had
a soporific effect, and the silent Mr.
Blanke, who is steeped in idleness and ob
livious enjoyment of nothing at all. He
makes reckless puns and his laughter is
unfailing and loud â his predilection for
his lawful spouse and little, little angel
Tommy is no less evident. Mrs. White

creature.

HALE AND WEALTHY
COUPLE WHO ARE LIFE
BOARDERS AT THE FRENCH
HOSPITAL IN THIS CITY
A hospital, even though a private one and equipped with ail the latest appliances
to combat disease and restore health, and er tbe favorable conditions imparted by
beautiful surroundings, an artistic building with every possible internal comfort and
a corps of attentive nurses and skillful doctors, is n ot a place that one can associate
with anything but suffering.
If those in health think of it at all it is with a feeling of thankfulness that they
are enabled to. keep beyond its walls. To tbe sick it is a temporary home entered
with fear and foreboding, and quitted with sincere rejoicing. As a rale even the very
sick would prefer their own home were it possible to obtain there the same medical
care and attention. As this is rarely possible, the hospital is regarded as a disagree
able necessity called forth by tbe ills to which poor humanity is subiect. That any
one in comparative health and with means at his command should select a hospital
as a permanent home seems hardly credible. Yet out at the French Hospital is a
couple who are subject, it is true, to the occasional illnesses that the natural infirmi
ties of old age bring, but who cannot in any sense of the word be called invalid*,
who have chosen voluntarily to make it their abiding- place for the remainder of
their lives.
..;..!â They are Mr. and Mrs. Henry, old residents of this City. During the twenty
eight years of their married life they lived in the same house, their own home, on
MaÂ«on street, near O'Fanell. They left it ', fourteen months ago to take up their resi
dence at the French Hospital. " The story of their com here is an interesting one.
By dint of bard work and unflagging industry on the part of both husband and
wife they acquired a competence. Their habits were always plain, and the acquisi
tion of money did not alter them. - Their two children passed away in infancy, and
they had no relatives here. They lived alone arid unattended. If in their younger
days sickness sometimes came the one waited upon the other. But as old age
crept upon them, and with it a certain feebleness, they felt the need of attendance.
Domestic help they found unreliable, so they considered other means of securing
personal comfort in sickness as well as in health. It ; might naturally be supposed
thut they would have entered a home for the aged. But they had other ideas.
. Although they are both Germans; and neither /speaks nor understands French
curiously enough they had been members of the French Benevolent Society for
twenty-eight years. Now they looked toward it as an old trie nd upon whom they
might lean, : not dependency, but in a most honorable and independent manner
They made arrangements' with the hospital connected with the society, and by the
payment of $3000 they secured -for life a comfortable home at all times and nurse,
medicine and medical attendance when ill. .â 
â¢ Mr. Henry is quite an old man-75 years-but Mrs. Henry is only 62. The latter
is a shnht, little woman; a typical German in feature, and though her hair is very
gray, her eyes are bright and she has a quick manner in talking that is convincing.
Seeing.her sitting in the corridor sunning herself one wonders if she has been a
patient, bat she quickly assures you she is not an invalid nor has she been one. Pos
sibly, then, her husband is sick, and she is here witb him? Ob, no; they are simply
life-boarders here. ; As surprise is evinced at this; she explains: â¢ '
and' il Â° U " 8 }t â¢ t Oll3 ? ti ! nM happened when we were in our 'own home that I was sick,
and it was very hard for 'my husband to attend to everything. Then one night we
were both sick together, so the idea came to us that if we were in a place like this
help could come at a moment's notice." â¢ ' -
during the intervals when yon are wpII, don't you care to live elsewhere?"
â  un, no. Come, I will show you how comfortable we are."
Â«iaS* ed th . way to her rooms/ which are on the first floor in the row of those as
signed to private patients. They consist of sitting-room and bedroom. The first
has in it her own â  f urniture^a lounge, several I chairs, a sewing-table, dining-taole
: and bureau. Bits of fancy work her bands have mad, give a home-like air to the
s room and t over all there Js: a neatness characteristic of the German housewife
â â â â ,â ;.. You . see ': 'said Mrs. Henry, seating herself and taking up her knitting, "what
nice rooms we have. And we coald not be more private in our own home. We
take our meals in our room and can order whatever we want. If we wish anything
between meals I need only touch the button, and if we are cold I pull this rope on
the wall and the heater is turned on." Â T v "
trance into tbe little reception-room. She
is lost in reveries of a calm, sweet, rustic
nature.
Ab! the start of surprise! Mrs. White
hat is recalled to this earth at last, and to
the perspiring and flushed young man
who stands staring at her, helpless and
transfixed.
There is a calm determination about
Mrs. Whitehat not to be lightly spoken of.
The young man and Jane Stella follow her
from spot to spot. Jane Stella claws her
his rival surreptitiously at every oppor
tunity and is tbe victim of some profanity
and several sharp little backward kicks.
The ingenuity of Mrs. Whitehat reaches a
sublime climax in tbe afternoon, when a
mild interest having been shown in the
attractive stranger by several of tbe other
members of tbe family they both dis
appeared and were seen a little later by the
disconsolate, bereaved ones in the basket
cart, with Bathsheba Florence in her wild
est moods, pursuing an imaginary goat.
Our host took a kodak view of the party,
which was a faint retribution.
Perhaps it would be profitable literature
to detail the incidents of each day, Mrs.
Whitehat being an inexhaustible theme
for the poet and the artist. My humble
pen fails me. Mr. Blanke developed a
latent talent and began a sonnet ad
dressed to her, the first ringing line of
which haunts my memory:
As I went bumping down the mellow leaâ
On the last day of the stay her spirits
rose to a degree; she volunteered to carry

tens little Tommy was secreting under hi 3
apron in her traveling bag. She over
whelmed our host with expressions of
gratitude for his charming hospitality
and almost wept tears of passionate regret
over her own bitter fate that she had not
been born to the country.
When the departure was actually ac
complished she indulged in wild and ir
repressible gayety, bursting into song as
the gate closed, "Sumer is icumen in.*'
She sang and waved her hands at a con
vale scent lunatic, who promptly baa a
relapse.
We caught a last glimpse ol Willow
mere as we descended to the station. It
was late in the afternoon, the cottage was
bathed in a luminous glow, the flowers in
the garden seemed to have melted to
gether in masses of brilliant bloom, the
purple heather ran down the hills like a
flame and Bathsheba Florence stood
against the sunset sky with the rollicking
breeze blowing her hair across her eyes.

In the forgotten lore of extinct people. I only know that,
cached in one crevice, there have been found several manu
scripts traced upon some substance resembling papyrus, and
from this discovery it is fair to infer that others, wonder
fully preserved through the lapse of centuries, may also exist.
Long study has been required to only partially decipher one of
these manuscripts, which appears to be a portion of the official
record of an ancient priesthood, whose rltars and religion alike
have sunken into oblivion. From this scroll only a small frag
ment of the succeeding story has been derived, imagination
necessarily supplying the remainder. The events occurred long
before the Christian era, in all probability. Without further
preface and without boring the reader with unnecessary details
concerning the finding and deciphering of the basis of this tale,
let us begin.
Wandering hand in hand, in centuries long agone, a man
and maiden, the last of one of the many races of the great
Maya family of nations, found themselves at the close of a
golden afternoon in the early autumn in a small valley amid
what are now known as the Panamint Mountains. A stream of
pure water, tinkling musically down the mountain side, gave
nourishment to the roots of large forest trees. The wanderers
came suddenly upon this scene as they emerged from a forbid
ding defile, one of many through which they had passed, and it
seemed to them as if they had been led to this spot. They were
sun worshipers, and before the monarch of day had disap
peered they raised their voices in a form of tuneful adoration
which they bad learned in a very distant land. They Knelt
upon grass as soft as velvet and crushed strange flowers, which
sent forth in their floral death exquisitely sweet and subtle
odors. The valley was rich in fruitage, affording an abundance
of food. In the tree tops wild birds caroled gayly. Here might
they rest, they thought
Long had they wandered, leaving tbe graves of their
ancestors and the home of their childhood behind them. The
foot of man seemed never to have been here before. Bountiful
nature offered gratuitously to the twain a hotne, and they gladly
accepted it. They found a cave and installed themselves
therein. They had no needs which could lead them beyond
their present pleasing environment. Back in the region from
which they had journeyed were only wasted lands and
slaughtered relatives who had been killed in cruel wars of
extermination. Beyond their present abiding place the world
contained only strangers whose intentions were unknown.
What seemed like Eden was theirs, and there they might rest
unmolested. Only the dangerous tuirst for knowledge might
lead them to sacrifice this newly found bliss, for here they might
dwell as long as the Sun God should give them life.
Ah, that thirst for knowledge! He whom we may call
Aymoyo (for his name is not on the scroll) was valiant and
adventurous. Despite the entreaties of the girl, whom we will
call Oonemalche, at whose forebodings he onJy smiled, he
wandered far. One night he failed to return, and many days
and nights of weeping and dreadful dreams tortured her, while
hope died within her breast. Then she started to follow him,
not knowing whither in the great wilderness of mountains to
tu/n her steps, but trusting to the Sun God to guide her. Ser
pents glided by her unheeded by night and by day. Fierce
wild animals glared hungrily at her and crouched to spring,
their eyes glowing like fire in their sockets, but the Sun God
held them back. She climbed high hills and scaled almost in
accessible peaks, how she knew not, but the Sun God led her
on. Alone she wandered, carrying with her the hope that her
race might not fail from the face of the earth.
One morning she saw a human footprint. Her heart
bounded, for she knew that it was his. Weary as she had
become she suddenly felt the buoyancy of youth return to her.
But now, as she drew near the edge of a precipice, she has teri
ried by a strange occurrence. Tbe sun began to hide his face,
ami she knew that this was an omen sent by the Sun God, but
she would not turn back. .Love was stronger than fear, a3d as
he. her lover, who went fortn by day, had been led by the Sun
God even so would she be led. Across the sun swept a black
shadow and the beasts of prey came out, thinking that it was
night, and howled around her. She could not go on now, for
the shadow was also on her ?oul, and the Sun God had told her
that she was doomed and that she and her race must ' perish.
Chilled to the heart she sank to the ground, but uttered no cry.

Hamiin Smith, the famous hunter and
trapper and White Chief of the Cocopah
Indians, is among the arrivals at the In
ternational. Mr. Smith has been in the
wilds so long that he has contracted a
malaria from the swamps where he has
been hunting egrets, heron, black crane
and other birds and he is now on his way
to the Hot Spring, Arkansas.
The man who has for so long been living
among the Cocopahs has since January
last been pursuing his vocation in Made
lane Bay, Lower California. This bay is
north of Ensenada and is lareer than San
Francisco Bay, for it extends over 100
miles.
It is a beautiful body of water, and on it
and along its shores are different kinds of
wild fowl, the feathers of which are ex
tremely valuable.
Mr. Smith has made feather hunting a
business for many years. For a long time
he sought the egret and other birds in the
region frequented by the Cocopahs about
the head of the gulf in Lower California.
Afterward he went to the swampy and alli
gator infested regions of Sonora, for,
strange as it may appear, some o; the most
valuable of the migrating birds are to be
found there.
He took many egrets, heron and other
birds, and returned here with large iots of
feathers, which he sold for large sums. It
was there, however, that he contracted
the fever germs, and notwithstanding he
has since for most of the time been in a
healthy section, the grip of the malaria
has not been dislodged.
Nevertheless, he has made a big catch
in Madelane Bay. He brought up fifty-two
ounces of egret feathers, with some heron
and black crane feathers, which netted
him here $1575.
These marvelously soft feathers are
worth the astonishing figure of $32 an
ounce, and this is the sum which tbe skill
ful hunter received. They were sold to Mr.
Toplitz of this City. .
The e^ret, heron and crane feathers are
used in the costliest millinery. Many of
the feathers eventually reach New York
and Europe.
"I first went down to Sonora to take
another hunt there for the birds," said
Mr. Smith, "but I found there were too
many hunters there already. The Mexi
can peons had taken a hand at it and were
bringing in a good many of the birds to
trade.
"For a good while I didn't think these
peons would ever acquire the skill to get
these birds, but they have, and no white
man can compete with them. They can
work so cheap. If they only get a few
feathers in a long while they are satisfied.
Besides this I found that the noted orni
thologists and taxidermist, 3. H. Beatty
of New York, had put forty skilled hunters
at work tLere. They were equipped with
the best guns and with auxiliary effects,
making for each the most complete outfit.
These hunters were everywhere and were
taking the birds wherever they appeared.
"Besides this, Mr. Beatty himself had
taken up his headquarters at Esquinapa,
where he could look after all the men and
receive their catch of feathers at regular
intervals. The peons were also out shoot
ing for him, so that altogether I found it
was no longer a good place for me.

The earth seemed to reel from under her and she lost consciousness. When she
ooened her eyes and saw the sun once more shining, her heart did not deceive her.
She waited patiently, with tearful eyes, but with no impious thought of flight, for
her doom. A tall, fierce man came forward from the shadow of a thicket and accosted
her in a strange language. She made no answer. .He pointed imperiously onward
with the gesture of one born to command, and she resumed her way, praying that her
steps might lead her to Aymoyo, and that in his company death might be sweetened.
One more glance at him, even if her death should immediately follow. Ah!
she felt that anything "would be better than life apart from him. She believed
him to be dead, and her tears flowed in a torrent, while her bosom was shaken
wfth sobs. *
Suddenly she saw Aymoyo face to face. She would have sprung to him, but his
eye forbade even recognition. He was clad in a panther's sKin with a wide girdle.
Marveling much at this mystery, and doubting him not, she passed him by nor
looked back, nor did he follow. She could hear the footsteps of the stranger behind
her and she felt his commanding presence urge her on and on. Toiling to the sum
mit of a high pass she suddenly came in view of a great lake (which is supposed by
the anthor to have filled the vast depression now known as Death Valley). Across
the lake, awful and dark, arose that enormous range which is now justly termed
tbe Funeral Mountains. From one of tbe peaks of the Funeral range ascended a

to avoid injuring the feathers as much as

As she drew nearer to the great lake a sound of surprise escaped from her.
! Connected by a slight bridge with the mainland was an island of considerable size.
In the middle of the island, surrounded by rank tropical vegetation, were the
gigantic ruins of a great city of stone, with a temple of prodigious size, and point
\ ing to the sky were huge pyramids of stone at tie four corners of the city. Enormous
I stone figures of wild beasts guarded imposing gateways. The arches of these portals
j were Iretted and were decorated with carvings representing the kings or priests of a
; race of unfamiliar aspect, and over the arches were inscriptions in a strange language.
! Oonemalche saw in these stony features a resemblance to the face of her captor and
I guide and she shuddered.
A cry, which was unmistakably inspired by horror, arose from the temple of
j stone as she approached. Intuitively learning that she was a worshiper of the Sun
I God, the votaries in the temple knew that she brought ruin. For it was written, long
* before, that final doom would overtake this city when a woman tbe favorite of the Sun
God, should cross and profane the city's mortals, which were sacred to the priests of
that deity, whose throne is on the (jeathless fires of the center of the earth. The

"Madelane Bay is a very beautiful
body of water, and I enjoyed my expe
rience there. There is one boat, the Ori

little settlement of four houses at one
place on the bay is all there is to represent
anything that suggests civilization. One
of these houses is a store. The families
are all Mexican. Outside of a few peons
scattered up and down the bay, who are
in fact native Indians, the country is a
wilderness. I only hunted for about three
months.
"Mr. Beatty, to whom reference has
been made, is the noted author on orni
thology. He has collected a great many
feathers this year over on the Sonora side
of the country.
"I shall now lay off for a time and take
a good rest, which I need. I may return
to these sections for more birds, but since
they are being hunted so much my im
pression is that I will go down to Brazil
for a time and go to hunting birds there."
Mr. Smith was for many years among
the Cocopahs. They thought so much of
him that t ey made him their chief, and
as the White Chief of the Cocopahs he
has long been known on this coast. His
complexion has a sallow look and his face
is thinner than usual. He hopes to be all
right in a few weeks though, as he is now
in a better climate, and where he has
nothing to do but take care of himself.
Horses Jhat SKoW
pare Intelligence
The almost human intelligence shown
by the two little bay horses tliat during
the daylight hours draw the Receiving
Hospital ambulance from the City Hall to
tbe City and County Hospital has inter
ested many who have watched their ac
tions, and Driver Dougherty fyas many
times been asked how he managed to train
them to their present degree of efficiency.
It is generally essential that the sick
who are intrusted to the ambulance be
conveyed to the County Hospital as ten
derly as possible, and the littie horses
seem to take special pride in this. When
leaving tne court in front of the Receiving
Hospital door they seem to take special
pains to avoid the sharp corners of the
stone coping, contact with which might
jar the patient inside.
Once clear of the court they swing along
at a gentle tr.>t until a street railroad
crossing is reached, and then their caution
becomes extreme. Without a word or a
move from t'ae driver they gradually
slacken their pace until they are barely
moving as the first rail is under their
forefeet. Keeping step, one foot gentiy
placed ahead of the other, they
bring the ambulance aoros3, the contact
of the wheels with the rails being barely
perceptible to driver or patient. Nothing
wili induce them to more than a snail's
pace before the last rail is passed, and the
clanging gong of an impatient motorman
or gripman has not the slightest effect on
their nerves or those of Driver Dougherty,
who knows that nothing short of the lash
of a whip will change their gait. Once
over the track the speed is gradually in
creased to the trot.
When the van is returning to the City
empty these diminutive equines know per
fectly well that there is no danger of their
hurting any one, for they trot merrily
along, and though force of habit makes
them slacken the pace at car tracks, tbe
same caution is not present.
He Brougkt Back a Big
Sack of Qold From /\laska
There arrived here on one of the coast
steamers a few days ago a medium-sized,
taciturn man with a tangled, reddish beard,
who was the subject of much comment
while en route. He had come from the
uttermost parts of tne wild interior, and
had with him a huge bag which he care
fully guarded.
The man's hands were hardened as if
accustomed to labor, and it was a fact that
he had toiled long and arduously. For
eight years he had been immured in the

snowy fastnesses near the line of the
Northwest Territory.
The stranger was T. Muller, the famous
pioneer of Muller Creek, sixty miles west
of Forty Mile, the outpost on the Yukon.
The mysterious bag which he had con
tained the accumulations of gold which
he had gathered during the eight years
and weighed 260 pounds. On an estimate
it was ascertained the gold was worth
something over $70,000.
The owner of the bag of yellow metal
took Quarters at the Commercial Hotel.
Sun God had led her to destroy the last city on earth of the
rival deity !
She heard the cry, but understood not its import. She
crossed the portal of the temple, passing many crumbling stairs
to reach it. She crossed a wide court and led by destiny came
to where the pavement, inlaid with many precious stones, was
a mosaic representation of the deity of the lost people. Centu
ries had passed in the collection of these gems. The lives of the
thousands who had carved and brought them from deep mines,
from the shores of many seas, from the glowing sides of vol
canic mountains and from burning desert sands, had gone put
upon sacrificial altars, that nothing might remain to remind
the deity that the gems had been profaned by human touch.
The blood of these victims was cast into a fountain which
bubbling upward threw the red corpuscles in air again and
again, mingling the vital drops of lovers, warriors and children
who had been compelled to toil daily for the deity, while
shrieks continually were heard by "the fountain of blood."
From the surrounding stones the bloodstains were never re
moved. There they remained, a mute memorial of barbarity
and fanaticism, of devotion and heroism.
Long ago had this fountain ceased to flow. But now, as if
to confirm the fate of the stranger woman, the waters started
into sudden life at her approach.
"it is an omen.' ' said her contuctor. "You are the woman
who is the favorite of the Sun God."
She comprehended him not, but her heart told her "it is
an omen."
The sun, glaring through clouds, threw a dull red light on
the sparkling fountain, giving it a tinge like blood. In the dis
tance the lofty volcano burned like the torch of the Almighty,
and across vast fields of snow on the serried mountains the
glow of volcanic fires cast a somber red.
While shriek? burst from the throats of a score of iron
browed men the earth shook. The volcano hurled high in the
air thunderbolts of lava. The image of the deity fixed for cen
turies in the stone pavement sank; and down with it unresist
ing, paralyzed by the certainty of doom, down, down, sank
Oonemalche into an imprisoning chamber of solid stone, which
had been hewn from an unbroken granite ledge. The jewels
fell apart and were scattered and the deity clamored for sacri
fice. The fountain fairly hissed for blood and the earth quaked
with repeated shocks.
Of a great people only a score of priests survived. Ruth
lessly they had sacrificed their wives and children that they
might no more incur the wrath of a jealous God, who had pun
ished their race with war and pestilence, decimating them to a
handful because they had thought more of their wives than of
him. No more could women enter their lives nor could beauty
move them. To them out of the wilderness came Aymoyo, a
stranger, young, athletic, handsome and brave. They made
him a priest â one of themâ and compelled him to assist in the
daily adoration of their deity. By this the Sun God was an
gered and had contrived ruin. Aymoyo was a captive and
could not escape. * * * *
When it bad come night Oonemalche was conducted to the .
great court where she was to meet death. Surrounded by
the priests, Aymoyo came forward to act as her executioner.
She made no sign. He raised a huge blade, mystically engraved,
above her shapely neck, and in another second the blow would
have fallen â perhaps upon the form of his beloved and perhaps
upon the nearest priest who acted as chief of ceremonies. But
there came from the sky such a peal of thunder that the blade
was arrested. [To be concluded next Sunday.]
[During the pause there Is an opportunity to reason out
what probably took place next. The situation was, perhaps,
unprecedented. Conceiving that Aymoyo loved Oonemalche
devotedly, and that her death would mean to him more misery
than death to himself, there is reason to suppose that, bein g
armed, Aymoyo would naturally have struck some blows in be
half of Oonemalcbe. On the other band, It is also equally prob
able that Aymoyo, being aware of the savage nature of these
priests and the futility of resistance, might have thought that
Oonemalche would, in any event, be killed and perhaps by tor
ture. Therefore duty might have prompted him, much as his
heart would have rebelled at the office, to actually become her
executioner. The real happening, as the author supposes it to
have taken place, will be related in the second and final chapter. .
and ere lone he began to adjust himself to
the surroundings, which after his long
absence from civilization seemed so queer
t<s him. The miner is a little over 40 years
of age and in excellent health, though in
order to make time in mining in that
frozen land, during each of the long win
ters he k.ndled fires on his claim, and in
this way was enabled to dig up the soil and
throw it into long winrows for washing in
the sluices when the spring thaw at last
ensued.
Mr. Muller is a native of Switzerland,
and never had any experience in mining
till he went to Muller Creek. He will,
after a while, go to his old home in the
Swiss mountains, and his friends are say
ing that they look for the sturdy miner to
greet an old sweetheart there and give up
his lonely life on the frontier.
As for himseif, however, the miner has
nothing to give of particulars concerning
any bright eyes that are alluring him.
May be he would think it a weakness to
do so.
('I don't know whether I shall go back
to raining again or not," he said yester
day. "If lam any account for anything
else I may settle down and go into some
kind of business, but I have been so long
at mining now that I don't know whether
lam tit for anything else. I will come to
a conclusion later when I rind out if I can
fit into this kind of life.
"No; my mine was by no means the
richest on Muller Creek. It averaged only
about $20 a day to the man. That is
nothing unasual there, for there are
claims that average as much as $50 or $100
to the man. There are some right along
side of me that will do that.
"The reason I was so successful is that
I went right along working my claim win
ter and summer. When it froze up I kept
fires burning, so that I could pile the dirt
in rows, and thus lose no time when the
water came in the spring.
"Though I was there about eight years
I made all the gold I have got in about
four years. The men who worked with
me I paid $7 a day in winter and $10 in
summer. They worked for $1 an hoar.
In winter we only worked seven hours
and in summer ten.
"If those who own claims around me
had worked steadily in winter as well as
in summer, as I did, they would have got
out large quantities of gold. The district
is very rich, and any man who has a fairly
good claim and sticks to it can make lots
of money.
"As I said, I don't know whether I am
good for anything any more but to mine.
If I can find out that I am I may quit it
and go into something else."
Mr. Muller has got his bag of dust and
nuggets turned into bright coins since his
arrival. One of the first things he did was
to go to the Mint. He is now taking life
easy at his hotel.
The grim miner has had many visitors.
Curious people have visited him to
learn what they can of Muller Creek, and
with each it has been a wonder as to
whether he could go there and return
with the gold which has been the com
pensation of the sturdy Swiss miner dur
ing his years in tbe snow. Mr. Muller
offers no advice. He says a great deal
depends.
One thing which he did before he left
has won him many encomiums. That
was to bequeath his ciaim to his em
ployes who had so long worked with him
in the bitter winter months. He was of
fered a price for it, but he refused to take
anything, choosing, rather, to give it
away. Of course, most of the gold had
been taken out, but what there was he
preferred to have go to those who had en
dured hardship with him.
The Flounder ar\d the Sole.
Theodore Hook was one night at a mu
sical party. During the evening a young
lady tried to sing a very difficult song,
which she gave with exaggerated expres
rion and a great many blunders. Next to
Hook sat an elderly lady, as decided an
amateur in criticism as the songstress in
singing. "Oh, Mr. Hook," she murmured,
"don't you adore her singing? It is so full
of soul." "Well, madam," said he, "for
my part 1 think there seems more of the
flounder than the sole about it."

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 22, 1896.-1
dropped into the Grand Central Palace
last week and waited for something to oc
cur that would move me to applause. I had
not long to wait, for in scanning the pro
gramme I came across the name of Meyer
Cohn, "the California barytone," as they
call him.
When Mr. Cohn appeared he was ac
companied by a wealth of paraphernalia
that made me wonder what he was en
gaged in. I thought, perhaps, he had de
veloped into a stereopticon lecturer or a
kinetoscope agent, but I was mistaken.
He is simply a singer still.
Behind him was a sheet of canvas, the
utility of which I discovered in time. 1
might as well relieve you now by saying
tbat he illustrated his songs with pictures
fitting the creation. Take the case
of his popular sentimental ballad,
"My Mother Was a Lady." When he be
gins to sing the benign face of a beautiful
old woman is flashed on the canvas and
as the song progresses and the fact is
brought out that a waitress is telling her
tale of woe to tbe audience that person
also appears. She proceeds to relate
through the mediumsbip of Mr. Cohn
that her mother was at the top of the
heap as a domestic attraction, and that
notwithstanding her occupation as a
waitress she was well connected as the
lineal descendant of a woman who was
I above all else "a lady."
As the song goes she is insulted by a
dyspeptic nourmet, and in reply to him
she remarks that the presence of one cer
tain " Jack," who appears to be a friend
of hers, would put a stop to all such busi
ness. At the mention of the said Jack's
name there is a flash of light, and Jack
looking quite bad and ready for trouble, is'
presented to the audience. Really it is
very funny to see the history and beliefs
of this poor waitress slide like a panorama

Rides.
Japanese Fraternity Outing in
Honor of Miss Alice
Wharton.
The Marine Yacht Club Entertains
Its Friends in Royal
Fashion.
"The Japs," a Japanese fraternity of the
Alameda High School, gave a delightful hay
ride on last Friday evening. It was given as a
farewell surprise to one of the leading mem
bers of tbe fraternity, Miss Alice Wharton,
who was to leave for her home and friends in
Fresno. "The Japs" Is the fraternity of the
junior B class who, tired of seeing and hearing
of Greek and Latin fraternities, decided on this
as a novelty. It is a very secret organization.
It is said that when one joins he must take
an oath in Japanese. The officers are all
called by Japanese names. The colors are
thoso of the Japanese flag, and everything
about the fraternity has a Japanese aspect.
The ride was kept a secret; no one outside of
the fraternity knew anything aDout it, and
when the classes were dismissed on last Friday
at 3:30 o'clock the scholars were much sur
prised to see two large wagons filled with hay,
lunches, flags and lanterns, waiting for .ome
one, they Knew not whom. Theu the "Japs"
came out In twos and marched down to the
wagons and started off amid many cheers and
good- by s.
The destination of the merry party was Lake
Chabot. After they had arrived at the lake
and had enjoyed boating, fishing, rambling
and other sports, a fine lunch was served.
After viewing the eclipse the party again took
before trip spectators, and the people of
Now York are so . delighted with it that
Mr. Colin is receiving something like $500
a week for his part of the came.
Sydney Palmer, for thirteen years at the
head of Palmer & Rey's Eastern advertis
ing business in Now York, has opened an
office of his own and is doing that quality
of business that generally comes to the
Pacific Coaster when he gets in harness.
; Dave J?6ltz, The Call's Eastern adver
tising manager, is once more at ; his desk
from a visit to San Francisco and has lots
to say about the quality of buainess that is
being done here for the paper.
.â¢/.-â¢ I must once more tell you of Frank
Nankivell's rapid advance to the front â¢as
an illustrator. Richard Mansfield, so well
known to the coast, has engaged him to
make ; his ; portrait for the next : season's
lithographs. He has instructed the young
man to turn out something entirely in his
; own original style, something that is
greatly : removed from ; the conventional
and customary theatrical work.
' Mr. Nankivell is now making sketches
from life, 1 and inside' of the, next month
200.000 sheets will be printed and sent
broadcast all over the land, with the! not
improbable result that theatrical work will
take on a new color. *

luxuries afforded by the East, -but they
have not forgotten that California is at the

way home, making the air resound with their
voices as they sang popular songs and "Ben
Bolt." The party arrived home at midnight,
after having spent a most delightful evening.
Those who were present were: The Misses
Alice Wharton, Daisy Smith. Leanor Center,
Alice Wayiainth, Jennie Russel, Muriel Bwain,
Grace Livingston. Fanny Frank, Floy Rose,

The members of the Marine Club gave an
outing to their lady friends last Sunday that
was largely attended.
By order of Captain McCrosson an early
start was made, and shortly thereafter bright
eyes and glowing cheeks showed how well the
ladles were enjoying the sail. In faot few if
any who have ever experienced the buoyant
exhilaration imparted by a yacht's motion
will ever forget the royal sport.
Once during the day, when an unusually
heavy swell was encountered, an impromptu
programme was arranged by the yachtstneh in
order to divert the minds of their guests from
thoughts of mal de mer and other disagree
able subjects. The result proved eminently
successful.
As a curtain-raiser the club's improvlsa
tlonist contributed a laughable skit, which he
sang to the air of "Ma Angeline." The vigor
with which the ladies took up the chorus at
tested how well his efforts were appreciated.
Will Retchless told some funny stories, Miss
Casey sang charmingly and Morris and Pless
played the banjo and guitar. Phillips, the
erstwhile kodak iiend of the club, being called
upon for a few remarks, gave a humorous dis
sertation on the "X" rays. The party disem
barked at McNears Landing, where lunch was
served, and that important function disposed
of they soon broke up into small groups to
search for the many pretty and romantic
spots to be found in that locality.
Late in the afternoon, all having re-em
barked, the return for home was commenced,
and with a favorable wind the run was made
to the City In good time.

Miss Mattie Kirby of Mills College gave a
straw ride Friday evening to Lake Chabot.
Luncheon was served at the lake under the
trees, which were hung with Chinese lanterns.
The' party was chaperoned by Miss Howard of
Mills and Mrs. Leland Shannon. Among those
participating were Mrs. Leland Shannon,
Misses Howard, Laird, Price, Warren, Mattie
Kirby, Mattie Gibney and Avis Gibnjey, Messrs.
Leland Shannon, Solomon, Boyd Amidon,
J. J. Dwyer of San Francisco, who, along
with Barry N. Hilliard of Idaho, attended
the meeting of the Democratic National
Committee as committeemen from their
respective States, left for home a few days
ago. Mr. Dwyer was slated for a place on
tbe campaign committee and the appoint
ment was made public by Chairman Jones
and printed in the New York papers.
Then the appointment was withheld and
the Californian returned home without
being officially notified of what action, if
any, had been taken or whether the ap
pointment was merely newspaper talk.
Mr. Dwyer made a favorable impression
with the leading politicians who swarmed
about the Fifth Avenue Hotel last week.
It turned out that Mr. Dwyer and Mr.
Hilliard were schoolmates in the Mission
as boys. They met at the Chicago con
vention for the first time in years. Both
were delegates from their respective
States. Hilliard went to Idaho early in
the eighties. With natiye talent and
energy he soon forged his way to the front,
and is now pne of the leading men of his
State. He took a prominent part in the
Chicago convention, being among the first
to declare for Bryan and Sewall. He will
probably have charge of the campaign in
his State, and there is some talk among
Idaho Democrats now in New York of
having him run for the United States Sen
ate in case his party is successful at the
polls.
Messrs. Hilliard and Dwyer remained
here for a week after the Bryan notifica
tion meeting, and, along with other Cali
fornians now in town, took in the sights
of gay New York. They witnessed the
great Futurity race at Sheepshead, where
Marcus Daly of Montana carried off a
$60,000 purse ana $150,000 on the side,
went to the seaside resorts, and listened
to the warblings of roof-garden songsters.

ENGAGEMENTS,
Miss Maraquita Collier and
Atherton Macondray to
Be Married.
The first of the important fall engagements
in society has been announced. It is that of
Miss Maraquita Collier and Atherton Ma- |
condray, both of whom are quite young and
have only been out a short time.
The bride to be is a daughter of Captain and
MrÃ. William B. Collier of Clear Lake, in Lake j
County, although the family spend most of
the time In this City, particularly since their
villa on the banks of Clear Lake was burned
to the ground about six months ago. Her
father is a retired officer of the United States
army and the family has always occupied a
prominent position in society circles.
Miss Collier made her debut last November
at the first party of the Friday Night Cotillon
Club. She became very popular and was con
sidered one of the belles of the seasonâ so pro
lific of handsome buds.
Miss Collier is at present visiting Miss Mol

of the house of Macondray & Co., and the in
tended groom is a member of the present
firm. He is very popular with the younger
set and also with his fello\7-members of the
University Club.
The engagement was one ol the surprises, as
few outside of the relatives and intimate
friends were aware of the affair. No arrange

TO SANTA CRUZ,
The West Shore Road Prom
ises a Competing Line
Soon.
BY THE OCEAN BEACH.
A Scenic Route Opening Up
Vast Timber and Agricul
tural Resources.
TO BE FINISHED BY SPRING.
The Promoters of the Road Hope, if
All Goes Well, to Complete Con
struction This Winter.
It is a fascinating idea, that of the West
Shore Railroad Corapanj. It promises in
little more than a year to take passengers
skimming along by the most attractive
stretch of coast country in the world, and
the way R. S. Thornton, president of the
company, and H. Homer, the civil engi
neer, describe the attractions of the route,
it is "one of the things no fellow can find
oat" why there has not been a road in
operation over the line before. Scenic
bpauty is not the only excuse for the road,
hcnvever. Its promoters show by the map
of the coast from San Francisco to Santa
Cruz, the proposed terminals, that it will
tap a large area of rich country which to
day is sadly in need of communication
with the outside world.
The road which the West Coast Com
pany promises to build is to follow the
coast all the way from this City to Santa
Cruz. Almost the entire distance it will
be within sight of the ocean, following a
route which has long been a favorite with
summer sight-seers who were willing to
experience miles upon miles of poor roads
lor the sake of scenery grand and beauti
ful. At only one or two points where nat
ural promqntories make it impracticable
for the road to follow the coast line will
the cars ever be more than a mile from the
water, and much of the way the refresh
ing sound of the breaking billows will be
the constant accompaniment of the rat
tling rails.
South of Pescadero the road will run for
some distance between the blue sea an<l
one of the erandest redwood forests of the
coast. Through this forest tiny trout
streams trickie to the ocean, making ihe
region a veritable paradise for campers
and sportsmen. Many have already dis
covered the delights of this region, but
the inhospitable coast, with its rock-reefs
and dearth of harbors on one side and a
forbidding range of almost trackless
mountains on the other, have stayed the
great army of summer pleasure-seekers.
The road, however, has more utilitarian
objects in view than catering to summer
travel. In a communication addressed to
The Call Marcn 25, 1895, by Arthur H.
Taylor, editoi of the Santa Cruz Surf, he
called attention to the vast resources of
the tract of land from twenty to forty
miles wide running along the coast from
Santa Cruz to San Francisco. "From the
crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains to
within a few miles of the seshore," he
wrote, "extends a virgin forest of timber
coverine 150,000 acres, the largest and
finest body of timber contiguous to a great
city that remains on the globe to-day."
Attention was also called to ihe fact that
the forest contains more tan bark than is
standing in the State. This is an impor
tant consideration, as tanbark has become
a comparatively scarce commodity.
North of this timber belt, however, is
the region upon which the promoters ot
the road count most for support. Here a
strip of rich rolling land follows the coast,
and under the industry of Italians, Portu
guese and Swiss the soil yields abundantly.
Dairy products are also an important item
of industry. AH these productions must
be marketed by miles of hauling over poor
roads. From Pescadero to the Southern
Pacific i- a distance of forty miles, the ob
structing elevation at one point being 3000
feet.
From Pescadero to Amesport, a dis
tance of Hxty miles, there is no means of
communication with the outside world.
The shortest route over the mountains at
any point is from Spanishtown to San
Mateo, and to market products that way
requires a haul of fourteen miles, the road
at one point reaching an elevation of 1300
feet
BtilJ further north the farmers are com
pelled to haul their products to San Fran
cisco. At midnight, at 1, at 2 or at 3
o'clock, dependent upon the distance
from the metropolis, the farmers, who in
this region raise vegetaDles principally,
commence their toilsome journey city
wara in order to be in at the early
marketing.
The ruinous effect of this long haul is
obvious, as, if example is needed, at Half
moon Bay when butter sells for 25 cents

It Is Virtually Boss of the Boulevard.
it commands in the San Francisco marfcet '
85 cents. The freight on butter from Half
moon Bay is $22 50 per ton. The new rail
road promises to carry it for $5.
The franchise of the road in this City
calls for a terminus at Twenty-nfth street
anil Potroro avenue. At Ocean View a
tunnel 3400 feet long will be made, passing
120 feet below the Southern Pacific tracks.
Then a detour will be made to avoid sand
dunes, and the track crossing the lower
end of Lake Merced will proceed through
Colma and down the coast. The rights of
way have oeen largely secured.
H. Homer, civil engineer of the society,
has just completed the maps of the route
and R. S. Thornton, president of the com
pany, declares that work will be com
menced as soon as possible and he hopes
to have the road completed between now
and spring. There wiil be seventy-six
miles of track and Mr. Homer estimates
the trip can be made in about two hours.
Alfred Tobin of the Hibernia Bank is
trustee for the company, Behring Joost is
vice-president, K. J. Willats secretary, R.
Herman treasurer and Louis F. Dunard
attorney.
The people along the route of the road
are enthusiastic over the prospect of an
outlet and are lending it their hearty sup
port.
FINED FOR CONTEMPT
Outcome of the Fracas in Judge Low'l
Court Between Attorney Treadwell
and Detective Curtin.
As a result of the fracas in Judge Low's
court Friday night Attorney A. B. Tread
well and Private Detective Curtin were
each fined $20, with the alternative of ten
days in jail by the Judge yesterday morn
ing.
In passing sentence the Judge said:
"Detective Curtin called Mr. Treadwell a
liar. There is no justification for such a
remark. Even if there be, in a police
ourt order must be maintained. The con
duct of Mr. Treadwell was equally unjus
tifiable and the whole affair was disgrace
ful."
Attorney Treadwell asked that the fine
be remitted as he had been punished quite
enough by having to pass several hours in
prison. He claimed that the Judge had
no power to punish him twice for the same
offense. "My Spanisli blood," said the
attorney, "arose above the Saxon and
when I resented an insnlt you sent me to
jail."
Reel B. Terry appeared for Curtin and
said they were willing to h&ve the fine
against Treadwell remitted. He admitted
that his client had made remarks that
were not called for ana he asked for time
to enable Curtin to get the $20. Later
Curtin paid the fine.
The Judee insisted that Treadwell
should pay the fine or go to jail, but gave
him time to get the money.
HARNESS THIEVES.

Three complaints were received at police

had their horses and waeons stolen. F. 0.
Pierson was attending a church meeting
on Laeruna street, between McAllister and
Golden Gate avenue, yesterday morning,
and when he came out his horae and
bucgy had disappeared.
W. Dressier was delivering a package at
625 O'Farrell street, and when he returned
his horse and waÂ«on were gone.
Pierson's horse and bupgy were found
at Willow avenue, between Webster and
Fillmore streets, but the horse had been
stripped of its harness. Dressler's horse
and wagon had been taken to Fern av
enue, between Franklin and Gough, and
the horse deprive! of its harness.
. The other rig belonged to a peddler of
dressed chickens, whicn had been driven
away from Golden Gate avenue, between
Fillmore and Webster streets. Up to a
late hour last night it had not been recov
ered.
BOSS OF THE BOULEVARD
Heavy Cylinder Rollers Not
Enumerated in the
Ordinance.
A Terror to Skittish Horses and a
Menace to the Safety of Timid
Ladies.
When the Board of Supervisors passed
the ordinance declaring Golden Gate and
Van Ness avenues boulevards the effect
was to close those streets for commercial
purposes. No business wagons, trucks or
carts were allowed to travel upon them
except when deliverine merchandise.
Street contractors who are laying con
crete upon streets in the Western Addition
and the Mission have made those avenues
their favorite drives with heavy draught
horses and rollers. Skitush horses shy at
them, endangering the lives of those be
hind them.
Horses so frightened were seen on
Golden Gate avenue recently on two occa
sions when a heavy roller was being driven
along that boulevard. " Fortunately, how
ever, nobody was injured.
Those who have witnessed these inci
dents are of the opinion that it will only
be a question of time till a serious acci
dent will result from a runaway.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 30, 1896.
WHIST
"Do not force, your partner when you are
weak in trumps" is a generally accepted rule
that is honored in the breaking far too often.
It may usually be broken with advantage
when partner has shown weakness, has ruffed
a doubtful trick, or has otherwise shown a
wish to be forced; for failure to force partner
then would complete a display of weakness
that adversaries would soon use to their ad
vantage. That he ruffs the adversaries' win
ning card doea not, however, imply a desire
to be forced again. How few players consider
an instant before plunging into the in
toxicating delights of a cross ruff Yet often
it is a short - lived delusion and a
Biiare that gives the opponents their only
chance to exhaust your trumps and bring in a
long suit. Suppose your second hand play the
ace on the lead of queeu and your partner is
void or drops the king. If you also are void
of one suit a cross ruff is at hand and yet you
must not force your partner without careful
consideration. He has twelve cards divided
among three suits and that he has fonr
trumps is a fair presumption. To force him
now may be the sole preventive of bringing
in his long suit, probably the one in which
you are short. Whenever you find your part
ner with a singleton or none of one suit early
in the hand you may well hesitate about forc
ing him and ask yourself the question: Should
I not lead a trump?
Hamilton says: "Suppose your left-hand
opponent opens the hand with the ace of a
plain suit, your partner throws king; with
any four trumps you should lead trumps at
your first opportunity. Such a situation de
mands a trump lead in nearly every in
stance."
The general rule we are discussing Is not to
be disregarded simply because an opponent
calls for or leads a trump, perhaps fearing an
impending ruff. If you are very weak in
trumps your partner has just so much more
chance of strength. A force may be ruinous.
If, instead, you can force the stronger trump
hand of the adversaries and otherwise protect
your partner's trumps the shoe may be placed
on the other foot and the trumps be exhausted
to the end that partner's or your
long suit is established instead of that
of the opponents and they are left with
the sad reflection that they have sowed the
wind and reaped the whirlwind. If greac
trump strength is declared against you bo that
it is altogether Improbable that your partner
can defend the suit he may, of course, be
forced with impunity.
y>'e have not meant to imply In the/c remarks
that you should force your partner when you
are weak in trumps, but that you should not
do so unhesitatingly, even though he has
taken a force once; even though you have a
cross ruff; even though some trump strength
is declared against you. Barring the possi
bility of partner being overtrumped by fourth
hand he has a sure trick, and a sure trick is
not to be refused without reason.
Careful consideration must be given to the
situation whenever the matter of forcing part
ner arises to assure yourself that too much
danger does not lurk behind the sure trick,
and generally it will be found best to force a
trump from the strong adverse hand or lead a
strengthening card in partner's suit. It is un
wise to play fast and loose with as good a con
ventional play as this. If partner knows that
you respect the convention he can take the
force and with confidence lead trumps or play
otherwise, as seems best; while if he knows
that you are likely to offer the force whether
you are strong or weak he may, with disas
trous results, refuse to trump.
WHISTLETB.
John T. Mitchell gives the following new
system of leads, with the remark that it is re
ferred to the committee on play for considera
tion:
Now that the adoption of the ten lead from
qunen-knave-ten has become almost general,
and in view of the fact that the knave is con
sidered the proper lead from king-queen
knave and the queen the proper lead from ace
king-queen, it seems to me that the committee
which was appointed at the last congress to
formulate a code of leads and follows for
recommendation to the league should consider
the advisability of revising the table of Ameri
can leads in conformity with a general rule,
such as the following:
With three or more cards in sequence, the
lowest of which is not below ten, lead the third
from the top.
With only two honors in sequence, both
higher than the knave, lead the higher. Witn
ace, queen, knave, lead ace; follow with queen
to show four, knave to show five or more.
Without any high card holding as good as
either of the above, iead your fourth best cara.
If the above rule was adopted it would do
away with the ten lead from king-knave-ten
and the ace lead from ace and four or more
small; bat as these leads have virtually been
abandoned already the new rule would not in
terfere with the general mode of play in that
respect.
The new rule, however, would make a radi
cal change in one respect, viz. : iv the lead of
the queen to show five or more in suit and
the lead of the king to show exactly four, and
that is where the principal objection to the
proposed change will come in. However, ac
cording to some authorities whose opinion is
shared by quite a number of experts the num
ber of small cards shown by a lead is not so
important as the exact strength displayed,
ana there is no question as to the superiority
of the proposed change in the latter respect.
The lead of tne ace would proclaim the king
or queen-knave, the lead of the king would
proclaim the queen, the queen would proclaim
king and ace, the knave would show the
queen and king, and the ten the knave and
queen. Each of the high cards from the nee
down ;o the ten. with the exception of the
ace, would proclaim a certain holding; and as
the ace usually wins the next lead would
clear away all uncertainty in regard to that
also.
The high indifferent cards left in hand after
the original lead could be used under the new
system to show number of small cards in suit
just the same as under the old, and the table
of leads would not be altered much in this re
spect.
Years ago Edgar Allan Poe wrote thus abou;
whist:
â 'Whist has long been noted for its influence
upon what is termed the calculating power,
aud men of the highest order of intellect have
been known to take an apparently unaccount
able delight in it, while eschewing chess as
frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a
similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty
of analysis. The best chess-player In Christen
dom m"sy be little more than the best player
ofoess, but proficiency in whist implies ca
pacity for success in all those more important
undertakings where mind struggles with
mind.
'â¢When I say proficiency, I mean that per
fection in the game which includes a compre
hension of all the sources whence legitimate
advantage may De derived. These are not
only manifold but multiform, and lie fre
quently among recesses of thought altogether
lnacessible to the ordinary understanding.
To observe attentively is to remember dis
tinctly, and so far the concentrativo chess
player will do very well at whist â¢ â¢ *, but
ttis in matters beyond the limits of mere
rules and memory that the skill of the an

"The analytical power should not be con
founded with simple ingenuity, for while the
analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious
man is often remarkably incapable of analysis.
Between ingenuity and the analytic ability
there exists a difference far greater indeed
than that between fancy and imagination, but
of a character very strictly analogous. It will
be found, in fact, that the ingenious are al
ways fanciful, and that the truly imaginative
are never otherwise than analytic."
The San Francisco Whist Club entertained
the Trist Duplicate Club on Thursday niÂ«?ht in
a royal manner. There were twelve tables in
play, and as far as possible partnerships were
made between players of' the two clubs.
Prizes were offered tothe two players making
the highest number of tricks above the
average. Very interesting hands came into
play and the prizes were won by Mrs. G. E.
Bates of the San Francisco club and Mr.
Johnson of the Trist club, who made eight
tricks above the average by the hardest kind
of play. After the game a supper was served,
to which all paid close attention, but if any
prizes were awarded no announcement was
made.
Mrs. L. W. Sitton, president of the Kate
WheelocK Whist Club of Portland, Or., is visit
ing this City.
"It should be borne in mina that there is
but one combination of cards that is more ad
vantageous to lead from than to have led up
to you, viz. : Queen, jack, ten, and there are but
two others in which it. as a rule, makes no ap
preciable difference who leads, viz. : Ace, king,
queen, and king, queen, Jock. With any other
combination the leader Is placed somewhat at
a disadvantage."â Evening Telegraph.
The Vallejo Whist Club is not qiscouraged
by its recent defeat in the game for the Ride
out trophy, and has issued another challenge
for the cup, asking that the play be set for Sep
tember 19.
Do not call a new play a fad until it !s proven
worthless. You have as nvich right to apply
this term "fad" to any new point in any scien
tific question as to a new play in whist.
Rule 1 say? no conversation should be In
dulged in during the play, except such as is
allowed by the laws of the game; but some
players continually ''indulge," and there
seems to be no remedy.

A GRAND RALLY
OF THE WHEELS
New Element in Local Poli
tics Rolling to the
Front.
THE UNITED BICYCLISTS
Say the Southern Pacific Will
Not Catch Them Off Their
Guard.
MASSING FOR THE CAMPAIGN
Want Their Bicycles Carried as Bag.
gage After as Well as Before
Election.
Wheelmen of the City are still out
spoken in favor of going before the Legis
lature next winter with a bill classifying
bicycles as baggage, and requiring the
railroad companies of the State to carry
them free of charge. Where at first there
waa only comparatively desultory talk on
the subject, the action of the Southern
Pacific Company in imposing a charge on
wheels and then subsequently withdraw
ing that decision had the effect of showing
the organized and "unattached" wheel
men the extent to which they are at the
mercy of the railroads, and showed them
the necessity of taking action to secure the
transportation of their wheels as baggage
after as well as before the election next
winter.
The canvass and the enrollment of
wheelmen and sympathizers to this end is
progressing steadily and with great pros
pect of future results. For the first time
in the history of local politics the wheel
men will have an opportunity to show
their strength this fall, both in the City
and the legislative tickets. There is a new
element now in local politics and its other
name is wheels.
More wheelmen are telling what they
think of the rescinded order of the rail
road company and an Armstrong bill.
Mr. Bill, of the bicycle hrm of Leavitt &
Bill, said: "It looks to us as though it
might be a subtenuge on the part ot the
railroad company to stand the matter off
till alter election and then perhaps reim
pose the charge. If this is :ue case the
company will find that we are not to be
caught napping. There was a Southern
Pacific representative in our store last
spring taking measurements of wheels
and frames. He said tne company in
tended to fit their cars with hooks, so as to
accommodate wheelmen. That is the last
we heard of it, and I guess they changed
their minds. We were talking of this
whole matter in here last night. All
wheelmen whom I have heard express an
opinion are in favor of keeping up a vig
orous fight and securing the passage of a
law similar to the New York law, requir
ing wheel> to be carried free of charge as
baegage. That is the wisest course to
pursue. I think the railroad company
will lose no money by meeting us half
way in this matter. If cars are properly
fitted up for the care of wheels and wheel
men know that their property will be
safely handled, my opinion i 3 that the
trains will be more extensively patron
ized. The bicycle Board of Trade will
take the matter up, perhaps at its next
regular weekly meeting."
President R. L. Radke of the Imperial
Bicycle Club said: "Let it drop before
election? Not much. We are not to be
fooled that way â that is, if the Southern
Pacific is resorting to any subterfuge to
throw us off the track. The Call won
the fight for us, so far as the rescinding of
the order was concerned, but I am for
keeping the battle warm till the Legisla
ture has passe I a measure similar to the
Armstrong bill. Then we will nave the
privilege of free wheels on trains after
election as well as after September 1
next.
"The executive committee of the
Wheelmen's Municipal League has the
matter in charge. I understand they have
heard from a number of candidates for the
Assembly wbo are willing to pit dge them
selves to the passage of an Armstrong
bill."
S. Hight, manager of a bicycle com
pany, said: "I regard a charge for the
transportation of bicycles on trains and
boats as unfair and an imposition, par
ticularly with reference to the ferries. If
that order had been carried out the com
pany would have lost considerable money.
The result would have been that wheel
men would have had their runs on this
side <>i the bay or over by way of Tiburon.
If the h\:ht is kept up and an Arm
strong bill passed by the Legislature we
will not run any risk of being charged
transportation on wheels after election,
notwithstanding the fact that the ord r
has been rescinded by the railroad com-
Dany. Club runs alone in the course oi a
season amount to a good deal of money,
and I think the company wiil cain in
stead of losing in its receipts from wheel
men by its recall of the order. Keep up
the fight."
Second Lieutenant Angus Gilmore, a
young member of the San Francisco Road
Club, said: "There will certainly be a
fight over this thing. We want our wheels
carried free after election as well as before.
Our boys do not want to go into politics
unless they find it necessary to protect
their own interests. They think that if
they do not win in this fitrht they will get
It 'socked to them' more than before, and
if they go into the fight they will enter it
to win."
H. C. Johnson, manager of a leading
cyclery, said: "The railroad gets its fare
and it ought to be prepared to furnish
wheelmen with accommodation as well as
otner passengers. In the first place the
railroads were not prepared for bicycles,
and the handline of them may have been
an inconvenience, but I think the charge
for the transportation of wheels is unfair
notwithstanding.
"T c company carries a great big trunk
that it takes two men to handle. Now the
wheelman seldom has any baggaire but
his wheel, and that in the absence of
trunks, etc., should, I think, be carried as
baggage free. The railroad that would
provide ho<>ks or other facilities for caring
for wheels safely and conveniently would
get its full share of the patronage of wheel
men, to say the least. As to an Arm
strong bill, or a law that will enforce prac
tically the sam â¢ privilege, I am, of course,
in favor of it. Wheelmen, both riders and
dealers, should continue to interest them
selves in the matter until such ;i bill is
passed. I am inclined to think that if
the wheelmen will unite and work to that
common end they wiil succeed in showing
members of the Legislature the fairness
and the desirability of such a law."
Randolph Garrity of the firm of Garrity
Bros, said he had noticed with pleasure
that the railroad company had reconsid
ered the order to charge for carrying
bicycles. He thought the 10-ceni charge
on the ferries was particularly obnoxious.
"We want a law in this State," he said,
"like the Armstrong bill of New York.
The agitation should be kept up till we
get it. If the wheelmen make a campaign
for such a law and stick totieiher there are
enough of us to secure its passage or wreck
some political hopes. Bicycles are bag
gage, particularly when a wheelman has
no other baggage, and they should be car
ried as suck five."

THE CALL S PEAKS FOR ALL.
PATRIOTISM, PROTECTION
and PROSPERITY.
FOR PRESIDENTâ
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Ohio
FOR VICF-PRKSIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersej
ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1 89fi.
The tide has turned.
All is plain sailing now.
McKinley stands for law, honesty and
prosperity.
Old Chang has reached this country just
in time to get on record as a campaign Li.
By the way he is talking Bryan is cut
ting his throat as well as making it hoarse.
Bryan's campaign began as a threat, but
it will be a joke before the campaign is
over.
California will not vote down the sub
stance of her gold mines for the Demo
cratic shadow of free silver.
The interests of the East and of the
West, of the rich and of the poor are
equally bound up in the cause of sound
money.
Bryan wanted to debate with McKinley,
and now Tillman has challenged Harrison, j
to a discussion. The youthful prodigies
are getting sassy.
Men are judged by their works, not by
their words, and what deed of Bryan's
contains any promise of good for the
American people?
We have reached the turn of the tide, j
and from this time on the cause of protec

THE GOOD OF RECIPROCITY.
We believe the repeal of the reciprocity ar
rangements negotiated by the last Republican
ail ministration was a National calamity,
and we demand their renewal and extension
on such terms as will equalize our trade with
other nations, remove the restrictions which
now obstruct the sale of American products in
the ports of other countries and secure en-
Inrqrd markets for the prodt(Cts of our farms,
forests and factories.
Protection and reciprocity are twin meas
ures of Republican policy and go hand in
hand. Democratic rule has recklessly struck
down both, and both must be re-established.
Protection for what we produce, free admis
sion for the necessaries of life which we don't
produce, reciprocal agreements of mutual in
terest which gai7i open markets for us in re
turn for our open market to others. Protec
tion builds vp domestic industry and trade
and secures our own market for ourselves.
Reciprocity builds up foreign trade and finds
an outlet for our surplus.
Reciprocal trade is the oldest as well as
the truest method of commodity exchange
because it is based on equivalency inde
pendent of money upon the one hand and
sentiment upon the other. It means
"trade and barter," and is fair or free
trade. Reciprocal trade comes and goes
without let or hindrance, and, moreover,
quality and quantity, not money, deter
mine the equivalency. That is to say, in
ternational reciprocal trade is made possi
ble because A of one country has more of
a given commodity than he wants bnt not
enough of another. Bof another country
has a surplus of that which A wants and
he is in need of some of that which A has
a surplus of. But they cannot yet ex
change cbeir commodities. They must
ascertain how much C of still another
country, who is a buyer of both A's and
B's kinds of commodities, will pay in
money for a given quantity of a given
quality of their commodities. This C de
termines by the supply of and thedemand
for such commodities.
It is G's prices that enable A and B to
exchange their commodities 011 the basis
of equivalency, but the money that C
would pay in must be the same in re
demption and purchase power in all three
of the countries, otherwise there would be
no way of'knowing what the equivalent
of one commodity would be in another
commodity. There need fee no reciprocal
trade relations between A and C, or B and
C, but there must be between A and B,
and they must be free to go and come be
tween- their respective countries without
paying to either country anything for the
privilege. But there could be no recipro
cal trade relations between countries
whose products were identical; on the
contrary, the true policy oi each would be
to secure itself against the competition of
the others by customs duties. This is
theoretical reciprocity.
For results accruing from the principle
of reciprocity practically applied we need
only to turn to the operation of the prin
ciple under the McKinley act During the
operation of that act our trade with the
countries with which reciprocal trade re
lations were established was more than
twice as much as it was before the McKin
ley bill became a law or has been under
the Wilson-Gorman act. We have not
only lost enormously directly, because of
the abrogation of the reciprocal trade
treaties made under the >icKmley act, but
because of some of the provisions of the
Wilson-Gorman act. Several European
countries have adopted retaliatory meas
ures, and our farm products more espe
cially are discriminated against. In fact,
the farmer has been the worst hurt by the
repeal of the reciprocity act, for in addition
to losing good markets for his breadstuffs,
he is confronted by the greatest encour
agement to the farmers of other countries
to increase their cheap-labor product for
consumption in Europe. Reciprocal trade
treaties are as necessary as protection to
this country, but Mr. Bryan says both are
wrong, and that neither shall be if he is
elected.
The people spoke at St. Louis and they said
two things especiallyâfirst, ' ' We will have an
income equal to the expenditure of this, the
most progressive nation on the globe; sec
ondly, our financial honor shall be as unques
tionable as our love of freedom and as our
trust in heaven." And, to make it all sure,
that convention simply registered the will of
the mine and the work-bench, the manufac
tory and the counting-room, the farm and the
village, the patriotism and hope of the repub
lic, and nominated William McKinley for
President. At that hour he was elected chief
magistrate of the United States. â Rev. F. W.
Gunsaulus. '
EX-PRESIDENT HARRISON.
There is no occasion for one to lose faith
in tne stability of onr institutions when
such men as Benjamin Harrison come
from the pleasures of retirement to help
rally the people around the fundamental
principles of the Government, that the in
tegrity and the honor of the Nation may
be guarded against foes, whether they be
from within or without. There was noth
ing to move Mr. Harrison to meet and ad
vise with his fellow-countrymen in New
York but the sacredness of duty.
Mr. Harrison has served his country
faithfully in the field, in the halls of legis
lation and in the Nation's executive chair,
and at bis pwn request he retired to the
quiet of home life. His public career
we thought was closedâ closed while the
whole country was rejoicing in peace and
prosperity to which he had contributed
much. But when sectionalism began to
parade in the highways of the Nation's
progress and threaten to march against
and overthrow the very foundation of the
Government and of society Benjamin Har
rison came forward with all the vigor of
youth to protest â to protest in words that
would De heeded.
"My interest in my country," said Mr.
Harrison, "did not cease when my last
salary check was cashed." Standing
there addressing thousands of his fellow
citizens, the ex-President exhibited no
heroism, nor was he a martyr, but the
representative of the highest product of
the civilization of the nineteenth century,
which is the spirit of freedom, right and
jnstice as manifested in the genius of the
principles of the Government of the
United States, it is in this fact largely
that the Harrisons of the country always
come from their seclusion without the
asking when the public good needs them
that the masses always feel secure, and it
is well that they do come and participate
with the people in their protests against
proposed departure from the methods and
customs which have made this people the
happiest aud best circumstanced people in
the world and their country the most
powerful as well as the most independent
nation on the earth.
And now will the people see and appre
ciate the cause of the ex-President's com
ing to them? It must be he believes
events are occurring which presage no
goo.i to the country's institutions, and
when it is remembered that Mr. Harrison
is very far from being an alarmist, it will
occur to thoughtful people that it is their
duty to carefully analyze the situation
and ace what it promises for good as well
as evil. But Mr. Harrison is not alone in
the beliei that the people are facing a

crisis. It may be said all those whom we
recognize as statesmen and wise leaders
believe this is a time wnen the patriotism
of the people should assert itself in a wav
that shall be a warning to all who would
assail the integrity and the honor of the
commonwealth.
That some may be rich shows that others
may become rich, and hence is just encour
agement to industry and enterprise. Let not
him who is homeless pull down the house of
another, but let him labor diligently and
build one for himself; thus, by example, as
suring that his own- shall be safe from vio
lence when built.â Abraham Lincoln.
THE ZANZIBAR INCIDENT.
The bombardment of Zanzibar by the
British and the reported attitude of the
Salisbury Ministry toward the island are
matters of something more than passing
intsrest to the American people, and par
ticularly to those of California. The bom
bardment was done in the intere?ts of
British trade, and those interests wonld
be much advanced by the annexation of
the island to the empire. However, it is
not likely the annexation will be made, as
it is said Lord Salisbury is not certain
that France and Germany would readily
consent to abandon their rights and con
sular jurisdiction.
We have in the incident, therefore, two
facts of note. One ia the promptness with
which British trade is backed up by the
British navy in weak countries, and the
other the evidence that the extent of the
backing stops short of the annexation of
the weak power only when some strong
nation stands in the way to object. With
the affairs of Zanzibar we have no partic
ular concern, but with the spirit dis
played by the British Government in deal
ing with it we have some concern, for that
same spirit may yet be shown by th-e
British in their dealings with the islands
of the Pacific Ocean or the weaker nations
along the Pacific Coast.
The United States has become a great
manufacturing nation and will soon be a
great exporter of manufactured goods. It
needs only that our Government shall do
as much for our merchant marine as Great
Britain does for hers to expand and ex
tend that commerce into every sea and to
every land that borders on the sea. This
of necessity will bring us face to face with
the British as competitors for the com
merce of tbe world, and that competition
will be keenest on the Pacific Ocean, for it
is on that ocean that the trade of the
future wiil find its largest and most profit
able development.
The islands of the Pacific are already
recognized as important to the world of
trade and commerce. Their strategic j
value is known to the naval commanders
of all nations ajd to diplomatists as well.
No well-informed man Ifi these days
speaks lightly of Hawaii, Samoa, New
Guinea or of the lesser groups of islands
in that wide sea. They will offer strong
points of vantage in the coming commer
cial struggle to the power that owns them,
and it is the duty of American statesmen
to tee to it that Great Britain does not
play in the Pacific Ocean the high-handed
game she has just played very nearly to
a finish at Zanzibar.
We have a great country and we must keep
it great. In wages and industries and in the
integrity of its finances and currency the
United States must be at the head of the na
tions of ihe earth. â McKinley.
WHAT A GREAT MAN SAID.
The Bryanites are ransacking the
speeches of the great men of the country
to prove that free silver coinage inde
pendent of other countries was indorsed
by them. Naturally they select the
speeches of those who are not among the
living. They do not want any one to
push them to the wall fur garbling. Mr.
Bryan does not hesitate to claim that all
dead statesmen would be advocating his
fallacies if they were alive, but the follow
ing from a speech of Daniel Webster shows
that if be were taking part in this cam
paign Major McKinley would have a very
strong supporter in the Massachusetts
commoner. Mr. Webster says:
"Sir, the very man of all others who has
the deepest interest in a sound currency,
who suffers most by mischievous legisla
tion in money matters, is the man who
earns his daily bread by his daily toil. A
depreciated currency, sudden changes of
prices, paper money falling between morn
ing and noon, and falling still lower be
tween noon and night â these things con
stituie the very harvest time of specu
lators, and of the whole race of those who
are at once idle and crafty, and of that
other race, too, the Catalines of all times,
marked so as to be known forever, by one
stroke of the historian's pen, 'those greedy
of other men's property and prodigal of
their own.'
"Capitalists, too, may outlive such times ;
they may either prey on the earnings of
labor by their cent per cent, or they may
board. But the laboring man, what can
he hoard? Preying on nobody, he be
comes the prey of all. His property is in
his hands. His reliance, bis fund, his
productive freehold, bis all, is his labor.
Whether he works on his own small capi
tal or another's, bis living is still earned
by his industry; and when the money of
the country becomes depreciated and de
based, whether it be adulterated coin or
paper without credit, that industry is
r obbed of its reward. He then labors for
a country whose laws cheat him out of
his bread.'*
Can any American citizen, to whom his
country is first in war and firtt in peace, and
who fully understands this question in all its
consequences, have the heart to throw our
country into this seething and heartless vortex
of silver speculation â this maelstrom of the
silver Mammon? â Senator Nelson of Minne
sota. ___^^________
PUBLIC SENTIMENT.
Major McKinley's letter of acceptance,
Sherman's speech at Columbus, Speaker
Reed's speech at Old Orchard, Me.,
ana ex-President Harrison's speech in
New York are exerting a powerful in
fluence for good all over the country.
The news comes from all sections that a
better feeling and more confidence pre
vails, and that capital is beginning to look
about for employment in new enterprises.
The feeling of unrest and doubt which
was so observable everywhere a week ago
is giving way to the belief, which is grow
ing, that the country will not fall into
the bands of rash experimentalists, and
that whatever Bryan may say or threaten
his utterances will no longer materially
hinder business operations.
Mr. Bryan may be thanked for helping
to bring about this change In public senti
ment. His speeches the past week have
been so sectional and vicious that oppor
tunity was given McKinley, Harrison,
Sherman, Reed and other distinguished
statesmen to fully acquaint the people
with the full meaning of Bryanism, and
tne people are governing themselves ac
cordingly. Such a sudden change in pub-
Hp. sentiment and such a sudden restora
tion of confidence in the commercial world
is not often experienced in this country,
but it is true, nevertheless, and every
body should be thankful that it is so.
Men who were pronounced Bryanites a
week ago are repudiating him; not because
they have changed their views on the sil
ver question, but his incendiary speeches
the past few days have convinced them
that he is a revolutionist, and not a well
balanced one at that. The people, not
even Mr. Bryan's friends, are prepared to
â¢Â»dopt his brother-against-brotherand war
and-blood policy. Having ?o overreached
the mark, together with the candid but
severe analysis of the man's fallacies by
McKinley, Reea, Harrison, Sherman and
other men in whom the country has con
fidence, the public is beginning to appre
ciate what the election of such ft man
would mean, and the turning away from
him is more pronounced than the turning
to him was when he was nominated.
The speeches of the gentlemen referred
to nave been circulated far and wide, and
they inaugurated a campaign of education
that is being feit in all the avenues of
trade and traffic. There never was such a
flocking to the standard-bearer of a party
as there has been to Major McKinJey dur
ing the last week or ten days, and the so*
called sound-money Democrats are draw*
ing irom Bryan every day. Even the
Popuiists are "working" Bryan's party in
many States, all of which gives the people
courage to go ahead and resume business
at the old stand. Nothing could be surer
than Major McKinley's election, for it is
evident that every man in the country
who wants none of Bryan's blood, war and
sectionalism in tbe administration of the
affairs of the Government is either
openly for McKinley or is combining for
Bryan'3 defeat, which means indirect sup
port of the man who stands for prosperity,
peace and the good of all the people.

MY LADY'S CHOICE.

Through the drowsy hours of a summer's day,
And I marvel ea much at her county rule
Ana pitied the knights who owned her sway.
A college youth was the first to sue. ' .
With a manner cold, till his boyish face
Flushed red a; glimpse of her dainty shoe
That peeped, as she swung, from. her Muttering
face. , , ;;, â  . Â,-.
He served for a while, but she wearied fast;
When he talked of sports and his college crew
She yawned in his face, till he went at last,
With a sadder heart than the lady knew. ,
A tenor, who came with an angel's voii*Â©,

So, Idly, she swung till the sounds of olght
Had tailed her to sleep aud a shadow crept
Up the gravel walk, through the falling light,
To the hammock's side where my lady slept.
She woke at a breath from Ills beading form,

LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE
DEMOCRACY AND MONET.
A Gold Democrat Shows That Jefferson
Favored thb Gold Standard.
Editor Cail: The essence of true Democracy
has ever been sound money for the protection
of the poor, ignorant and helpless. By sound
money tbe Democracy has ever meant money
which was as nearly as possible on a par with
that of the nations with whtch our principal
trade was conducted and money of universal
value, and such as would maintain Itself as
merchandise at the general level of the world.
These are the old, standard and approved tests
of money for the Democracy. Therefore has
paper money ever been rejected by the De
mocracyâin the sense of Government paper;
because the paper value is not mercantile and
cannot maintain itself at the general level of
tne world's commerce. If the paper be too
abundant it cannot go out as an article of
merchandise to a country where It is scarce,
but must remain in the country where it is
issued, to choke the channels of circulation,
drive out all specie and continue to depreciate
itself.
Silver no longer fills the conditions of good
Democratic money. It is no longer the money
of the countries with which our great trade
is conducted. If declared of a value equal to
gold, at a valuation of sixteen parts of silver
to one part of gold, when the valuation of the
world's commerce declares 16 to 1 to be false
ana the true valuation to be 81 to 1, silver
will no longer maintain itself at the general
level of the world* and will be mere local
United States money and nearly as dangerous
as paper. No conservative, balanced man can
assert with firm belief that all the silver in
the world Will obey the alchemistic command
of our lawyer congress and rise, presto, to 16
to 1. Therefore, 16 to 1 silver in undemo
cratic and violates all the teachings aud tra
ditions Of the party. So assert the principles
of Jackson and Jefferson. In the letter to John
W. Eppes, November 6, 1813, found in volume
VI of Jefferson's works, at page 231, Jefferson
writes: "To trade on equal terms the common
ineacure cf value shouid be, as nearly as pos
sible, on a par with that of its corresponding
nations whose medium is in a sound state
that is, not iii accidental state Of excess of de
ficiency."
*suw one of the advantages of specie is that
being of universal value (which gold alone
would be at 16 to 1) it will keep itself at the
general level, flowing out frdm where it is too
high into parts where it is lower; whereas, if
the medium be of local value only, as paper
money (and 16 to 1 silver) if too slight indeed,
gold and silver (now gold oniy) will flow in to
supply the deficiency, and if too much, it
(paper and 16 to 1 silver) accumulates,
banishes gold and silver (under 16 to 1 ban
ishes the gold) locked up in vaults and hourds,
and depreciates itself, i. c., its proportion to
the annual produce of industry being raised,
more of it is required to represent any particu
lar article of jiroduce than in the other coun
tries. It may be seen, therefore, that Jefferson,
if alive, would stand ior world money only,
to wit, the single gold standard. Very faith
fully, John Ueenak.
WHAT HAS HE DONE?
Chicago Times-Herald.
From the beginning of his public career Mr.
Bryan has talked of the sufferings of the peo
ple with choking voice and tearful eye. But
has he ever contributed anything save talk to
the cause of labor of the common people? A
consideration of Mr. Bryan's brief public life
yields the conclusion that his Interest in the
sufferings of the people begins and ends in the
use he can make of the subject in his lifework
of competing for oratorical prizes. Mr. Bryan
has never been anything but an orator. He
has been piling np the crowns whicn his ora
tory has brought him, while labor has been
bearing its crosses. Mr. Bryan never per
formed any one act of service to the Cause of
labor. He never helped pass a law to secure
higher wanes for labor. He never assisted in
any legislation designed to secure comfort or
independence ior the worltingman.
He never helped to shorten the hours of la
borâthough he has done his part in taking
away the opportunity of labof. He never
helped advance the system of arbitration. He
never sought to relieve labor from the oppres
sion of great monopolies. He has never, so
far as is known, held out the hartd of charity
to tbe unfortunate. He has never coutributea
anything to the cause of the common people
save talk. He voted to continue the oppres
sion of a large number of people made free by
Abraham Lincoln. And now he is Working to
the end that the wages of labor the country
over may be reduced by one-halt. Mr. Bryan
invites comparison between Abraham Lincoln
and himself. There is no more resemblance
between Lincoln and Bryan than there is be
tween a granite hitching-post and a bumming
bird. Mr. Lincoln proved that he was not a
demagogue by a lifelong service to the op
pressed and wronged. His monument is what
he did, not what he said.

Whin women go into the ranks as soldiers
and tight side by side with their husbands and

there can be no doubting the determination
of the insurgents or the futility of the Spanish
cause. Nothing short of extermination of the
revolutionists will enable Spain to govern Cuba
again. It is high lime for mediation, peaceful
or otherwise.
A Lesson From History.
Calaveras Prospect.
One of the great lessons of history, as ex
pressed by Hon. William McKinley, li that ag
riculture cannot rise to its highest perfection
and reach Us fullest development without the
aid of commerce, manufacture and mechani
cal arts. All are essential to the healthy growth
and highest advance of the others; the
progress of one insures the prosperity of
another. There are no conflicts, there should
be no antagonisms. They are indispensable
to each other. Whatever enfeebles one is sure
to cripple ihe rest

CortD EXCHANGEâ N. B. F., Citrus-, Inyo
County, Cal. From present indications and
the utterance of the leaders of the Democratic-

LADY'S YOKE WITH EPAULETTES.
Here Is shown a perfectly plain waist, which
is made to appear very elaborate and dressy
by a simple accessory. A yoke like this can
be worn with any waist, and is a great help
when one's wardrobe is limited.
The pattern is cut with the straps in one
piece with the yoke. The epaulettes are sewed
on at the shoulder.
A waist of plain cloth may be made very
stylish with trimming of the new cashmere
velveteen cut after this mo-lel. The edges
may be turned in or simply bound with rlb-
DOn - ' ,
Another charming way to remodel a plain
waist is to have this trimming of a contrast
ing color in clothâ say a black waist with
mignonette preen cloth. This may be span
gled along the edge 3or be bordered by a
fringe of fur.
Plaid silk is also used over plain cloths or
silks.
Flouncing may be used for the yoke and
epaulettes, with 'band lflce for the straps. Or
the yoke or straps may be cut in owe' of piece
lace, ÃBi,ng a highly-colored nilk for lhiing.
Black lace makes a very effective .trimming
for almost an*, waist.
Blnck het, plain or the dotted, may be used,
the edges turned in and trimmed with green
or black spangles sewn on close together. If
the dotted net is used, a spangle may be sewn
on each dot.
Piece embroidery can also be utilized for
such a trimming.
The natural colored Brass linen or batiste
makes a very stylish accessory and Is not ex
pensive. Either the plain or the all over em
broidered ones can be used.
Plain white lawn or batiste are very dainty.
All the edges to be trimmed with tbe narrowest
of yellow Valenciennes lace. The collar to be
of row upon row of lace on a plain strip of the
goods.
Ribbon two and a half inches wide, joined
together by strip of embroidery or lace the
same width can be used, with the lace laid
over the ribbon for tbe straps.

EVASION OR COWARDICE?
New York Mail and Express.
Two years ago William J. Bryan canvassed
the State of Nebraska in search of a United
States senatorship. His labor resulted In a
Republican victory. At that time he was an
out-and-out free-trader, and he is the same to
day, although he seems to have so far lost the
Courage of his convictions that he dared not
make even casual reference to the tariff issue
in his Madison-square Garden speech. Some
people call this evasion; others term it
cowardice. But as all evasion is cowardice
the designation means little, the fact much.

WORK IS NOW
BEGINNING TO WIN ITS
LONG OVERDUE FAME
Sidney Lanler has been scarcely more than a
vague name to the great mass of American
readers. It is fifteen years since his life went
out under the pines of Noivth Carolina and it
is only now that the recognition of his right to
rank with our great American t>oets is becom
ing general. His recently published letters,
edited by William Thayer, have created a
wider interest in the man and his work.
Mr. Thayer says: "1 know not where
to look for a series of letters which in bulk
equally small relate so humanely and beauti
fully the story of so Drecious a life." While
Lanier lived there were few with the insight
to discern his worth. Since his death each
year has brought a wider recognition. In 1890
the English Spectator said of him: "Lanter
died so early that he did not really uhow us
more than the bud oi his genius, but if he had
lived ten years longer he would, we believe,
have ranked high among English poets and
probably above every American poet of the
past."
This was high praise from a great English
journal, nine years after the death of the man,
whose appreciators while he lived might al
most have been counted on the fingers of one
hand. In tnese dÂ«ys of fads and sudden fame
for "work of little value, it seemed a cruel thing
that the man whose work has survived so well
the relen'.less test of time should have had the
bitterness of unappreciation added to his life
struggle. Life was indeed a struggle from first
to last for Sidney Lanier. He fought poverty
and ill health with splendid courage, and
never wavered in his faith in hisown ultimate
success. He was one of those rare souls who
-.rite because they mustâ impelled from with
in by they know not what hidden force. He
speaks in one of his letters of being "racked in
every fiber by the birth of c new poem."
He followed his muse up a steep and thorny
path which led him to the heightsâ never to
the fleshpots of Egypt.
Lanier was born in Macon, Georgia, in 1842.
He was the first of those brilliant writers which
the South has piven us in recent years. His
familyâ who dated from colonial days in the
Southâ were of French Hugueuot descent.
Like Pierre Loti, he had that impressionable
and artistic blood in his veinsâ with what a
different result in these two men! The living
French writer and man of the world has for
tune and fame and social distinction, yet finds
himself forever unsatisfied with these and sad
dened by the hopelessness of unfaith; while
our dead Southern poet struggled against all
the ills of life, yet left the memory of an un>
quenched hope and courage of spirit.
At the age of 14 Lanier entered Oglethorpe
College, from which he was graduated with
honors. When the war broke out he enlisted
in the Georgia Volunteers. After two years'
service he was taken prisoner and confined at
Point Lookout, where he endured many
hardships.
After being exchanged b* made his way on
foot to Mucon. On reaching home he broke
down with ihe first premonitions of his ter
rible enemy, consumption, which fifteen years
later ended his life. He recovered from the
first attack, secured a clerkship and married
aUa Day oi Mncon. She became a most de
voted wife, sustaining him always by her ten
der care and her faith in his genius. Lanier's
father wished Dim to practice law. He tried
it for a time, but found it hopelessly uncon
genial. From this time his career was SRdly
checkered. He ' taught school for a time,
played first flute in the Peabody orchestra in
Baltimore, drifted from one thing to another
with constant breaks in his work because of ill
health. Mr. Thayer .says "neither sickness
nor drudgery conld long turn him from the
deepest craving of his spirit."
In 1875 his long poem "Corn" was published
in Lippincott's Magazine. Lippincott's. though
not ranking first among American journals,
has the unique distinction of being in many
instances the first to recognize the worth of
work by unknown authors. Mr. Peabody, edi
tor of the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, to
whom most of the recently published letters
were addressed, wrote a glowing review of
"Corn" in the columns of his paper. It was
almost the only recognition the poem had,
and Lanier was correspondingly grateful. He
wrote Mr. Peabody a warm letter of thanks,
which led to a correspondence and later an in
timate friendship. After this time Lanier
made shift to keep the wolf from the door by
his magazine verses, a miserably uncertain
dependence. Probably only a poet can know
the misery of having to write at the demands
of an empty pocket.
- In 1876 he had become so far Known tnat
hp had the honor of being chosen to write the
words for the opening cantata of the Cen
tennial. He was rarely gifted in music as
well as poetry, and it was his great desire to
show the scientific connection between these
two branches of art. Some years later he de
livered a course of lectures on the "Science of
English Verse," in which he sought to prove
that the law of rhythm in sound applied equally
to words and to music.
He was terribly handicapped at this time by
successive attacks of his malady. One winter
he had to drop everything and go with his
wife to Floridaâ their two boys being left with
the good friends, the Peabodies. The letters
from Tampa to Philadelphia that winter are of
the most intimate character. They record his
gradual recovery in the balmy air of the
. South and his relief at being able to send a check
(just received from some magazine) in part
payment of a long standing doctor's bill.
In the spring they returned to the North,
and next year there seemed to be some small
respite to those money worries. He writes
from Baltimore that they have taken and are
furnishing a little house, whicn causes them
great delight and a feeling of importance at
being absolute housenolders. After this' he
gave lectures in addition to hi^ literary work.
A little later there was some idea, much
favored by President Gilman, of establishing a
chair of music Â«nd poetry at Johns Hopkins
University and presenting it to Sidney Lanier.
This plan was the foundation on which Lanier
built many dearly cherished hopes, but it was
never fulfilled. He was, however,' engaged to
deliver several courses of lectures at the uni
versity. It was there that he gave his course
on "The Science of English Verse." The sec
ond course, given just before his death, con
tain the lectures published under the title of
"The English Novel." There is much even of
contemporary criticism that is stiil valuable in
these essays. Lanier's bent wns always toward
what is sane and wholesome in art.
It is, however, in bis poems of nature that
Lanier is at his best. His "Hymns to the
Marshes" breathe an ecstacy of appreciation
that must thrill every lover of nature who
reads them. The greatest of tnese is "Sun
rise," the last poem he ever wrote, and the
one Dy which his name will be remembered |
wherever English poetry is known. I know ot
no other poem which so suggests the flavor of
the early dswn, its freshness and exhilara
tion.
But no; It Is made. List! Somewhereâ mystery.
where?
In the leaves? in the air?
In my bear ? is a motion made.
Tis a motion of dawn, like a flicker of shade on
shade.
In the leaves 'tis palpable; low multitudinous
stirring
Up winds through tbe woods; the little ones
softly conferring
Have settled my bird* to be looked for, so; they
are aiill ;
But the air and my heart and tbe earth are athrill,
Aud look where tbe wild doc* sails round tbe
bend of tbe river.
And look where a passionate shiver
Expectant la bending the blades
Of tbe marsbgrass in serial shimmers and shades,
And Invisible wings fast fleeting, fast fleeting, are
beating
Tbe dark overhead as my heart beats and steady
and free
In the ebb tide flowing from marsh to sea.
The poem ends with a splendid pean of
praise, strong and fearless in the face of I
despair, like the writer's own soul :
I must pass from the face, I must pass f rom the
face of tbe sun,
Old Want ia awake and agog, every wrinkle afrown,
The worker must pass to his work in the terrible
town,
But I fear not, nay, I fear not the thing to be done,
I am strong with the strength of my lord, the Sun!
How dark, how dark soever the race that must
needs be run!
I am lit with the sun.
Oh, never the mast-high run of the seas
Of traffic shall hide thee;
Never the hell-colored smoke of the factories hide
thee;
Never the reek of the times fen politicshide thee,
And ever my heart through the night shall with
knowledge abide thee.
And ever by clay shall my spirit as one that bath
tried thee
Labor at leisure, in art, till yonder beside thee
My soul shall float, friend Â£un,
The day beine doae.
Fitting last words for a man whose whole life
was a triumph of the inner light over outward
darkness. Grace S. Mcsser.
A NEW LIFE OF CHRIST.
Many have been the attempts ot writers and
painters in the past to present an accurate
idea of the figure of Christ and the personages
of bis time. More especially has it been the
favorite theme with literary men. In this
connection we have had the splendid works of
Archdeacon Farrar and Ernest Renau, whose
ideas ran rather in the direction of essayists.

THIRTY YEARS OLD
HOY LONG WILL IT LAST?
Lights from the windows are gleaming and
glancing.
Music and laughter are echoing near,
Save where the twain move apart from the
dancing
Uttering vows each was longing to hear.
Tender his tones, in their low modulation,
Timidly downward her glances are cast;
Eyes matched with sapphire, cheeks with
carnation,
Fair is the pictureâ how loDg will it last?
Think when old Time, of all jokers the grim
mest,
Whitens the tresses and furrows the brow,
Changing the forms that are lithest and
slimmest-
Will your affections be steady as now?
True that to-day, in its ardent devotion,
Love takes no heed of the future or past;
Curbine and checking the tide of emotion.
Prudence should whisper, "How long will
it last ?"
All were in vain, though the caution be
needed,
Prudence is ne'er the companion of outh;
Passion for aye leaves unnoticed, unheeded,
Warnings of wisdom and promptings of
truth,
Forging the fetters that bind them together,
Gilding the hours the t are flying so fast;
Careless oi sunlight or stormiest weather,
Love never questions, "How long will it
last?" ____^____ L - E - L -
WOUNDER AND HEALER.
Translation of an Arabic song.
Thy witching look is like a two-edged sword
To pierce his heart by whom thou art sur
veyed ;
Thy rosy lips the precious balm afford
To heal the wound thy keen-edged sword has
made.
I am its victim; I have felt the steel :
My heart now rankles with the smarting
pain;
Give me thy lips the bitter wound to heal â
Tby lips to kiss and I am whole again.

FATE.
Two shall be born the whole wide world apart,
And speak in different tongues, and have no
thought
Each of the other's being, and no heed.
And these o'er unknown seas to unknown
lsnds
Shall cross, escaping wreck, defying death;
And, all unconsciously, shape every act
Aud bend each wandering sten to this one
end-
That one day out of darkness they shall meet
And read life's meaning in each other's eyes.
And two shall walk some narrow way of life,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 30, 1896.
General Lew Wallace and Marie Corelli, again,
tried to treat the same subject, using a scrip
tural background, but with a leavening of
fiction. For the painters there are the works
of Rubens, of Rembrandt and of numerous
others. But it must be confessed that the
works of all these have been the means of
creating in the public mind a vast aggrega
tion of what, for want of a better term, can be
called false images or impressions. It has
been left for a painter of to-day, M. James J.
Tissot of Paris, to give to the world a truthful
representation of the life and times of Christâ
to disengage it, as far as possible, from a mass
of conventional legendary lore, at once in
accurate and misleading.
M. Tissot's work had a curious origin. He
returned in March, 1887, from a visit to Je
rusalem, with a few sketches that he had made
in the Holy Land. These he showed to his
father, a pious Catholic. The parent, regard
ing the work of the son, remarked that the
sketches banished many cherished illusions
derived from a study of the Bible and a con
templation of some of the works of the old
masters. Tissot the younger then conceived
the idea of returning to Palestine and of mak
ing, from actual topographical and other ob
servations, a series of paintings illustrative of
the life of Christ. Eight years were to be de
voted to this gigantic work.
The results of his journey, or some of them,
were exhibited in the Salon of 1894. The en
thusiasm and interest they aroused was won
derful, even for Paris. Day after day the pic
tures were surrounded by admiring crowds,
and it was quickly recognized that here, at
last, was a man who had reproduced with
lifelike accuracy the external setting of the
events recorded in the gospels.
The advance sheets of Tissot's "Life of
Christ," just issued, bear witness to the pains
taken by the artist in the matter of accuracy.
Scene after scene is presented with whtt
would seem almost the power of a seer. Here
we see the ornate temples and houses of the
Herods and the simpler and more harmonious
lines of older buildings; there a wonderful
study of the Pharisee and the publican. Some
of these pictures are very small, yet the appli
cation of a powerful glass only serves to reveal
in them new beauties. The painter has been
greatly assisted in his work by the fact that he
is himself a scholar, besides being a devout
Catholic. For these reasons he has had access
So nearly side by side that should one turn
Ever so little space to left or right
They needs must stand acknowledged face to
face.
And yet, with wistful eyes that never meet,
With groping hands that never clasp, anl lips
Calling in vain to ears that never hear,
They seek each other all their weary days
And die unsatisfied. And this is Fate.
ACROSS THE SUNLIT LAND
Come, love, across the sunlit land
As blithe as dryad dancing free,
While time slips by like silver sand
Within the grass of memory.
Ere winter, in his reckless glee,
Blights all the bloom with ruthless hand,
Come, love, across the sunlit land,
As blithe as dryad dancing free I
And all the years of life shall be
Like peaceful vales that wide expand
To meet a bright untroubled sea
By radiant azure arches spanned;
Come, love, across the sunlit land,
As blithe as dryad dancing free I

GROWING OLD.
Is It parting with the roundness
Of the smoothly rounded cheek?
Is it losing from the dimples
Half the flashing joy they speak?
Is it fading of the luster
From the wavy golden hair?
Is it finding on the forehead
Graven lines of thought and care?
Is it droppingâ as the roseleaves
Drop their sweetness, overblown-
Household names that once were dearer,
More familiar than our own?
Is it meeting on the pathway
Faces strange andvglances cold.
While the soul, with moan and shiver.
Whispers sadly, "Growing old" T
On the gradual sloping pathway,
As th<? passing years decline,
Gleams a golden lovelight, falling
Far from upper heights divine;
Ana the shadows from that brightness
Wrap them softly in their fold.
Who unto celestial whiteness
Walk, by way of "growing old."

THE PARADOX OF TIME.
Time goes, you say? Ah no!
Alas, Time s iys. we ro;
Or else, were this not so,
What need t<> chain the hours,
For youth wen- always ours?
Time goes, you say? Ah no!
Ours is the eyes' deceit
Of men whose flying feet
to rare books, prints, carvings and tapestries
hidden away in monasteries and other places
inaccessible to the ordinary tourist.
M. Tissot has made careful studies in the
Talmud and in the writings of Josepbus. In
connection with his work he has also made a
new translation of the Latin text of the
Vulgate. The Latin and French texts are pre
sented siae by side, and the pictures are fully
explained in the notes which accompany
them.
Appended is a technical description of the
book, translated from the original French:
"The work will be composed of two volumes
of about 600 pages each, illustrated with 365
aquarelles by Tissot, and about 150 explica
tory sketches â charncter-heads, costumes and
landscapes, after natureâ friezes, ornamental
letters and tail-pieces, designed by the artist.
"Of the 365 aquarelles, which are repro
duced in color by the newest processes, giving
absolute fac-similes of the originals, 329 are
interspersed with the text and 36 outside the
same, of which latter 16 are drawn on copper
p>ate and reproduced in tint.
"The text is printed in Elzevir type, specially
cast, with explanatory designs engraved on
wood.
"Each volume will be numbered and will
bear the name of the subscriber."
As we have shown the work is a monumental
one. This being the case it would not be
reasonable to expect that it would be within
the reach of everyone's purchase. The first
twenty copies on specially made Japan paper
are listed at 5000 francs each, or, roughly,
$1000. These have all been bought up by
wealthy bibliophiles. The remaining copies of
the edition, to tie number of 980, will be sup
plied at 1500 francs or $300. The cost of pre
paring the work, therefore, could hardly have
been less than a quarter of a million of dollars.
The Call is indebted to Mr. William Doxey
for a view oi the advance sheets of Tissot's
work.

Your locks were curling gold,
And mine had shamed the crow.
Now in the selfsame stage,
We've reached the silver age;
Time goes, you say?â ah no!
Once when my voice was strong,
I filled the woods with song,
To praise your "rose" and '-snow";
My bird, that sang, is dead;
Where are your roses fled?
Alas, Time saysâ wÂ« go!
See in what traversed ways,
What backward fate delays
The hopes we used to know;
Where are our old desires?â
Ah, where those vanished fires?
Time goes, you say?â ah no!
How far, how far, O Sweet,
The grHss behind our feet
Lies in the even-glow!
Now, on the forward way,
Let us fold handy, iind pray!
Alas, Time staysâ we go!

Co., publishers; for sale by Doxey: price ?1 -so-
Gabriele d'Annunzio is not well known by
his works or even by name to the public of
this country; but he has won recognition in
the literary circles of Europe, especially in
France. Jules Lemaitre has called him "the
romantic poet of the Italian renaissance." He
ii not yet 33 years old, and is already ranked
as one of the great Italian writers of the pres
ent time. A volume of verses which D'An
nunzio published in 1883 were so extremely
erotic as to bring upon him tne same censure
that fell upon Swinburne when the latter's
"Poems and Ballads" first appeared in Eng
land. D'Annunzio has genius, but that genius
is largely stained by moral defects. "Episcopo
and Company" is one of his lesser and earlier
works, and it is to be regretted that the trans
lator should not have chosen one of the Italian
author's later and worthier novels through
which to introduce him to American readers.
In the book at hand he treats of lowest life in
Rome after the manner of the realists. The
deathbed story of Giovanni Episcopo is unfit
for the ears of young readers. Some of the
passages border closely on the obscene. The
style is exceedingly nervous, reminding one
much of Poe's "Tell-Tale Heart." Take, for
example, this:
Didâ did you seeâ the corpse? Did It not seem
to you that there was something extraordinary in
the face, in the eyes? Ah, 1 forget, the eyes were
closedâ not both of them, however, not both. I
know that well. I must die if only to rid my fin
gers of the feeling of that eyelid which resisted.
I feel It here always, as if a bit of the skin had
stuck on the spot. Look at my hand. Is it not
a hand that has already begun to die? Look
at it.
Episcopo is a bloodless being â a coward,
wholly under the evil influence of a bad char
acter named Wanzer. He bows to this man's
slightest command or wish. Episcopo marries,
but Wanzer made the match. The latter leaves
Italy for a few years. Meantime, Episcopo be
comes the father of a boy, whom he names
Ciro. Then suddenly Wanzer returns and
seeks to force Episcopo again iato slavery. He
succeeds for a time. He wins the smiles of
Giovanni's false wife, and then one day he
beats her, and Ciro attacks the brutal Wanzer.
The woman flees. Wanzer departs for a short
time, but returns, and it is now that the base
slave frees himself, because of his love for
Ciro. Wanzer looks about for the woman;
and during this time Episcopo stands petrified;
he cannot move. Let the story as it closes tell
itself here:
"Suddenly my child uttered a cry, which in
stantly freed rcy rigid members. My eyes turned
â¢o a long knife which shone on the sideboard and
my hand clutched it. Prodigious strength filled
my arm. 1 felt myself carried as on a wave to the
door of my son's room, and I saw my son clinglug
with feline fury to Wanzer's great body, and I saw
Wanzer's hands upon my son.
"Two, three, four times I plunged the knife Into
his spine up to tbe hilt.
"Ah, sir, for charity's sake do not leave me
alone! Before night falls I will die. I promise
you I will die. Then you may go; you will close
my eyes and go away. But do, I will not even
ask that. I myself before I die will close my own
eyes.
"Look at my hand. It has touched the eyelids
of that man and it has turned yellow. Tboee eye
lids, 1 wanted to close them because Ciro kept sit
ting up in bed and crying, 'Papa! papal he is look-
Ing at me! 1
"How conld he have looked at him, covered as
he was? Can ihe dead look through sheets?
"The left eyelid resisted, cold, coldâ
"How much blood! Is It possible that a man
contains a sea of blood? The veins hardly show;
tbev are so delicate you can hardly distinguish
them. And yetâ there was noplace left where I
cou.d put my foot; my shoes were soaked like two
spongesâ strange, was it not?â like two sponges.
"One of them, so much blood; and the other not
a dropâ a lily. O God, a lily. Is there anything so
white on earth?
"Ulles, only lilies!
"But, look; look, sir! What is happening to me?
What is it I feet?
"Before night falls; oh! before nightâ"
We anticipate with pleasure the translation
into English of d'Annunzio's latest and best
novel, "Vergine del'.e Rocce." It is claimed
for it that it will withstand two tests of really
great literature; namely, "that something
shall survive the first reading of the book,
and that It shall be impossible to read it only
once."
LITERARY NOTES.
It is hoped that the first and second vol
umes of Gibbon's unpublished works will be
ready this autumn. _
John Strange Winter has finished a new
story which will be published shortly. The
title oi it is not announced yet.
Henry Hardwicke, a member of the New
York bar, has written a history of "Oratory
and Orators," which 4ie will publish soon.
Anatole France, the French academician, has
written a preface to along poem by M. Leon
Heley. The pcem. entitled "Mentis," is to ap
pear very shortly.
The Hon. James Bryce's "Impressions of
South Africa" will soon be published in book
form. Four of these articles appeared in the
Century. Mr. Bryct's knowledge of the sub
ject, his statesmanship and his qualifications
as a writer will make this a standard work.
Miss Edgeworth's well-known story "Helen"
Is to be included in Messrs. Macmillan's Stand
ard Novels. It will have an introduction by
Mrs. Ritchie, Thackeray's daughter, and illus
trations by Miss Chris Hammond.
A new edition of the late Mrs. Lamb's "His
tory of New York" has been prepared for
Messrs. A. S. Barnes & Co. by Mrs. Burton Har
rison, who has added a chapter on the ex
ternals of the modern city, with illustrations.
This chapter will be published separately,
also, in the same style as the whole work.
"Rhyme* of the States," by Garrett New
kirk, with Harry Fenn's illustrations, will be
issued by the Century Company in October.
It is a geographical aid to young people, con
taining brief facts of the importance regarding
the different States of the Union and novel
illustrations, which will help boys and girls to
rememDer the salient features of each State.
Joel Chandler Harris has revived his "Daddy
Jake, the Runaway," which was issued several
years ago, and a new edition in attractive form
will be published by the Century Company in
the autumn. It contains a number of stories
of Brer Bar, Brer Terrapin, Brer Fox and
'"JESUS WORKINC WITH JOSEPH."

PROMISE OF THE
AGES-SOME
BLANK VERSE DEDICATED
TO JOSEPH LE CONTE
THE PROMISE OF THE AGES (a poem). By
Charles Augustus Keeler.
In a blank-verse poem of fifty pages Mr.
Keeler has attempted to present the struggles
of an eartiest mind with some of the modern
life-problems; and, in the personality of the
Prophet, to exhibit these questions as they
pass through the mind of the idealist. As to
the basis upon which tbe poet proceeds, he re
marks in his introduction that "The law of
evolution forms the keynote of this latter
nineteenth century. It is the principle of
transformation, of growth, of progress. It has
profoundly modified our thought In all fields
of observation and speculation, reconstructing
the foundations of science and challenging
the dogmas of religion. In striking contrast
to this modern conception of- the origin of the
forms of existence is the more venerable doc
trine of a divine creation, executed con
sciously by the volition of God in order that
his love might find expression in tangible
form. The clash of these two opinions, with
their innumerable side-issues, is termed the
conflict of science and religion. If religion is
to prevail in this conflict, it will be at the
price of certain concessions popularly deemed
of intrinsic importance, and especially by the
surrender of all which cannot be defended by
reason, namely: the miraculous."
Mr. Keeler observes that the frank use of the
subject-matter of science in poetry may be
called into question, but he believes that a
justification for this is found in the recogni
tion of love as the animating principle be
neath all the conflict and tumult of the ages.
The poem recognizes the principle of evolu
tion, but seeks to transcend this with the
higher thought of the ultimate reality of the
spirit. It is an attempt at a synthesis of the
essential ideas of Darwin and Emerson. The
poem is dedicated to Berkeley's eminent phil
osopher, Joseph Le Conte, in the following
lines:
Seeker, wboae science o'ermaaters the spirit's
despair â
Teacher, whose truth mounts to heaven In worship
and prayer-
Prophet, whose deeds are a witness of faith, free
and si rongâ
Not to tender vain tribute to t hee. do I pledge thee
my song.
But to gain from thy life and thyjlove, benediction,
dear friend,
To hallow my labor with graces thy presence can
leud.
Mr. Keeler's wide fame as a scientist and
author, and his rank as a poet of more than
ordinary merit, will commend this small
volume to the distinguished consideration of
an extensive circle of readers. He sings of the
immortality of the soul and his vorse3 contain
many passages of beauty. The impressive last
words of the dying prophet near the close of
the poem breathe a powerful sermon in them
selves :
Man's love is the heart's loveâ man's work and
his lore ,
other famous animals, told to the well-known
little boy who is the recipient of the old
negro's confidences. It was formerly issued as
a square book, but is now reset and made ft
companion to Kiplingls jungle books.
Austin Dobson has prepared another seriesâ
the thirdâof his "Eighteenth Century Vig*
nettes," The contents of the new volume ard
of a very varied character and will include;
"Exit Roscius," "Dr. Mead's Library," Grog
ley's â¢' Londres," "Polly Honeycombe,"
"Thomas Gent, Printer"; "The Adventures
of Five Days," "Fielding's Library," "Cam
bridge, the Everything"; "The Officina Ar.
buteana, " "Matthew Prior," etc. The work
will be published in London by Messrs. Chatto
A Windus, but wilf not appear for some little
time.
One of the most interesting of forthcoming
volumes will be the work dealing with the
Brontes, on which C. K. Shorter has now been
for some time engaged. He has had the advan
tage not merely of several interviews with, but
is also receiving from, Mr. Nicholls, Charlotte
Bronte's still surviving husband, a number of
MSS. which the latter had always hitherto de
clined to partVith. Mr. Shorter differs from
Mrs. Gaskell and some other Bronte student*
in their judgment with relation to Branwell,
regarding whose life story and that of the
gifted sistei-s of Haworth parsonage there will
be much that is both new and interesting in
the volume, which will appear in the autumn.
Brentano's oi New York announce for early
! publication "Short-Suit Whist," by Val W.
Starnes. The short-suit game contemplates
the endowment of the intermediate cards of
all suits, trumps included, with winning prop*
erties, by taking advantage of their position
in tenace, by underplay, and by strengthening
leads which shall be judiciously finessed by
the partner. It also prefers making one's own
and partner's trumps separately on the master
cards of the enemy, when the opportunity oc
curs, instead of having them fall together.
This is the pioneer volume in Its especial field,
for since the advent of "Cavendish" and Pole,
all writers on whist, with the exception of
Foster, have advocated the long-suit game to
the exclusion of all other forms of whist
1 strategy.
Is the spirit's assertion of freedom and life;
Man's hope is the heart's hopeâ man's faith and
his trust
Is the spirit's belief in the beauty of truth;
Man's -.ruth is the soul's truthâ the soul's truth lÂ»
whole truth,
And the whole truth Is God with his lovingof man,
Man's love is the Lord's loveâ man's wors and
his lore
Is the Lord's mighty planning revealed in his
sons;
Man's hope is the Lord's hopeâ man's faith and
his trust
Is the falih of the Lord in the beauty of truth;
Man's truth is the Lord's truth, that smites the
heart's chords' truth.
And the heart's chorda are ringing with God's love
for man.
THE MODERN READER'S BIBLE. Genesisâ
Ecclesiaatlcus. New York: The Macmillaa
Company. For sale by William Doxey; price
50 cents each.
These two little books are part of a series.
The Modern Reader's Bible is an attempt, and
a very successful one, to place the revised
version of the Testament in such a form that
the historical, oratorical, statistical and epic
portions shall be easy of access to the general
reader.
To read the Bible is, of course, a simple mat
ter; but to read it with appreciation is made
somewhat difficult by intricacies of style, and,
as the editor notes in his preface to the Book
of Genesis, by the differences in the form in
which books are presented in ancient and in
modern literature.' Professor Moulton, under
whose scholarly supervision this series of aids
to the study of the Scriptures has been issued,
happily describes the manner in which the
aye. age reader of the Bible is handicapped,
by saying that while books presented in ouch
shape will be read, they will not be read with,
zest. "The constant necessity of mentally
allowing for difference of literary form
makes such reading resemble the use of a
microscope with an imperfectly adjusted
focus; by thinking it is possible to make out
what the blurred picture should be, but the
observer's attention wearies, and all the while
a turn or two of a wheel would give clear
vision." ,
To this we can add that Professor Moulton
has siven the necessary turn of a wheel. Be
sides the undoubted scholarly character of
the work, there is that in it which betokens a
labor of love, undertaken in a. reverent spirit.
Than this nothing more need be said to indi
cate its value, both to students and to the
general reader.
According to the eightieth annual report of
the American Bible Society, its total issues, at
borne and abroad, for the year ending March
31 last, amounted to 1,750,283 copies. The
issues of the society during the eighty years
of its existence amount to 61,705,841 copies.

California is so large in area and so di
versified in climate and surface that it is
like a small world with all the different
types. Half of it knows not how the
otber half lives.
In the northern part of the State,
among the eastern spurs of the Coast
Range, is a true unknown land. The
world unknowing and by the world un
. known, its scattered people live out their
isolated lives in content, sinking into their
graves in the rocky hillsides, sure that
heaven will be something like a mining
Country hid in the mountains.
The mountains and the beds of the
many forks of small rivers are full of gold.
The mines are worked in a primitive way,
necessitated by their position. They can
not be phenomenally rich or they would
cause roads to be built and towns to spring
up, but I am persuaded were they taken
in hand by men used to spending wealth
to gain wealth the result would surprise
some of those who have shoveled and
drifted a lifetime for the food and clothes
demanded by nature.
There used to be a greater population
â¢ than there is now. the only evidence of
which are names without places. In the
middle of a desolate flat will be a pile of
stones or the remains of a mud and rock
chimney. That, the people will say, is
Peterstown, or Ladyslipper, or Lakeview,
or Halfway, or half a dczen ether names,
as the case may be; they all look alike,
and are alike desolate and abandoned.
In "early days" there were at each a
store, a blacksmith-shop and a saloon.
Now there are three of these deserted
villages between every two settlements.
The settlements themselves could hardly
be called extensive. There will be two
houses. In one somebody lives, and the
other is store, postorh'ce and saloon in one.
Sometimes the mail gets dropped behind
the whisky barrel and lies there like
Ginevra in the chest until the barrel is
liioved.
The mail comes in two or three times a
-week on 'jorseback. The law sits loosely
â¢ on the carrier, and if he forgets to come
no one does more than prowl a little.
Each mine of any importance has its
own little store, so the people need go to
the "town" only for mail.
All the goods, all the flour, all the min
ing machinery come in during the sum
mer by pack trains. The merchants of the
nearest towns, often sixty miles away,
have trains of from twenty to fifty mules,
and all through the months from June to
â¢ October these trains wind in and out
among the hills, leaving a part of the load
at each mine or settlement.
During the other months there is no
communication with the world except by
mail, and a deep snow will often keep
that out a month or two.
The winters are bitterly cold, with snow
piled up to the windows and keen winds
sweeping down from icy peaks. But the
people know what to expect, and all sum
mer may be heard the beat of the wood
man's ax and the whiz of his saw to fill
the sheds with stored-up sunshine.
.The houses are rough, sometimes of logs,
but oftener of boards siowly cut by the up
and down mill turned by a mountain
stream. Every house has a big, iron cook
stove to heal red and glowing, and besides
a deep fireplace with a back log and plenty
of pitch knots.
What the men do during the long, dark
winter, when there is no mining, no gar
den work and no woodcutting I could
never find out. Perhaps they sleep, like
the bears.
The little ones slide down hill, make
snow men and throw snowballs like little
Eskimos, while their mothers make quilt
patches, braid rugs and knit.
Children there have never seen a four
wheeled vehicle. The little hay cut is
taken to the barn in rude carts. I remem
ber once that a big srreen and yellow Stude
baker wagon was brought up in sections
and put together. It was to be used be
tween two mines, but proved a failure.
The children looked at it with admiration,
almost awe.
They asked me if I didn't think it just
lovely. I said I did. The spectacle of a
circle of boys and girls in ecstasies over a
big ugly freight wagon was unique. It
was from this land the girl came who, the
first time she saw telegraph wires,
wondered why folks had their clothes
lines up so high.
There are schoolhonses about thirty
miles apart. Each gathers in nearly a
score of pupils, while those who live be
tween do without. Many of the children
are part white and part Indian. Many
learn an Indian jargon at home, and the
teacher's first few weeks is spent in learn
ing to understand it.
One who takes as a matter of course all
the privileges and luxuries of contact and
. civilization can hardly imagine the life of
these mountain people, bo near to the
heart of nature and so far from the arts of
men. Just so the children who have not
been outside the circling ranges cannot
imagine the life of those who dwell in the
Crowded town.
Do not imagine, though, that the moun
tain boy is enviouÃ of his city cousin.
Rather he pities him the lack of sky
touching peaks to climb, miles and miles
of creek to fish in and preserves of deer
free to every owner of a gun.
It has puzzled me, this perfect content.
I have tried cruelly to disturb it by pic
tures and word pictures of ocean, park
and town, and tales of the sights and
sounds of city life. Interested?
Yes â just as you used to be
interested in fairy tales, calling
for more, yet knowing they were only
stories. I have known them to be re
moved, to be taken into the centers of
life, ana they pined for home. I knew one,
sent away to school, who could hardly
wait lilt the summer to return to the most
lonesome, desolate spot, three days' trail
ride from a town, and a home not the most
harmonious, and who, after lour years of
civilized existence, married and settled for

life in the mountains, satisfied that there
alone was true happiness to be found. I
spoke to a squaw, whose half-white daugh
ter had married a white man, and had
been welcomed into his family, and she
said:
"Yes. Mary he come home this sum
mer. Henry he no want come, Mary he
come alone, and Mary he no go back â no
good down there."
Old men and women who came there in
their prime or their youth have settled
like stones in the bed of the river. The
current of life sweeps over them and dis
turbs them not. They never intend to
move and they even consider it an evi
dence of bad taste that all who come do
not take root too. The water and the air
are their great arguments. Nowhere else
in the world is there water so pure or air
so full of life.
As a matter of fact I had my first and
only taste of ague in their pure air, and I
would ratiier breath a deep, damp breath
from the ocean any day. But I am a
heretic.
. It was there I saw a regular new wo
man. I had ridden late into the night
and asked shelter at the first house. In
such a country the unbidden guest is
doubly welcome and hospitality is un
bounded. In the gray dawn, as I was
waking, the door opened and I thought a
young Japanese boy came in with hot wa
ter. While I stared in shocked surprise, a
very sweet girl's voice told me to stay in
bed and she would bring my coffee to me.

Jomes
On Fourth street, near Stevenson, there
is a second-hand bookstore that has been
there for years and years. The interior of
the store, that can be entered from the
street, is little different from other stores
of the same kind ; but there is a portion
of it that few people see that is most likely
the only place of the kind in the City if
not in the whole State.
Persons who buy only ordinary books
run no chance of seeing the queer place.
But ask for some book that was published
many years ago and the proprietor will
most likely say that he has it.
He will then take you out at s backdoor
into a yard, where he will lead the way
down a flight of steps with damp, moss
covered brick walls on both side 3. Open
ing a heavy door and lighting a candle he
will ask you inside, saying that you will
most likely find what yon want there.
And what a queer place you find your
self in. The cellar, for sucb it proved to
be, is in inky darkness except for the faint
light shed by the candle. But on all sides
can be seen piles of old books. There are
thousands of them. Enough to fill any of
the large libraries in town. They spread
out in all directions and form avenues
that appear to have no end. Wandering
through them is like a labyrinth. One
looses all bearings and could easily get lost
as far as knowing which way to turn is
concerned. A person in the place without
a light might crawl around for hours with
out finding; the door to get out.
The cellar extends under several build
ings and the books it contains have been
accumulating over a quarter of a century.
All are thickly covered with dust and
that peculiar "bock" smell fills the air.
Although the street is only a few feet
away a dead silence reigns. The owner
says that months frequently pass without
anybody entering the place.
The old cellar is itself intensely inter
esting, but many of the books are much
more so. There are parts of stories on the
flyleaves of many of them in the inscrip
tions there. Here is an old Goodwin
arithmetic published in 1842. On the title
page is the inscription "Thomas Dickens,
Oxford, 1846." Where is Thomas Dickens
now, and what was his career that led to his
schoolbook being stacked away in an old
cellar so far away irom England?
CAMPAIGN TALK
It is fun to listen now. Wherever you

My Jap was a slender brown girl of six

hair braided down her bacK.
All summer I climbed the bills and
picked berries, and rilled my herbarium,
with those same overalls by my side.
A sweeter, more feminine girl I never
met, nor one who panned out better with
intimate acquaintance. The boys' dress

and approaching womanhood with its
burden of skirts was anything but wel
come. At first she offered to wear, when
in ray company, a short, scant gingham
skirt over the trousers, but the effect
was to send us both into fits
of laughter and she abandoned
the idea of further compromise
than her pink sunbonnet. Poor little

unlike the natural growth, she longed for
the fleshpots of Egypt "When I started
for my home beside the lovely bay, the

This unknown land is one of rare beauty.
Nature was in a poetic mood when she

crowned them with white.
It is a land of promise for the hunter,

silver dollars will be coined to one of gold
to the startling and original one that one

The other evening there was exhibited
an interesting bit of frankness. Two el
derly men were arguing on the street
about currency. One had a big, blatant
voice, and the other a rather weak but
shrill tone. The big voice drowned the
little one completely and drove its owner
from the field. As he watched his oppo
nent stride huffily round the corner, the
victor winked at the crowd and asked,
"Didn't I pepper him good? Bat, say,
can any of you fellows tell me what he
meant by 16 to 1?"
One man who talks different politics to
every man he knows in order, as he says,
to bring out ideas has crushed both Re

same speech. It begins like this: "There
is a great similarity between this cam

of solidity of judgment, and if against a
Republican he raves and shake his Pad

Lincoln and another. Nobody knows how
he will vote, though he wears a Bryan

Ernest Miller, who has already earned
the reputation of being the champion egg
eater in the world by his feat, performed
last week, of making a meal of six dozen
and a half of hen fruit, is modest withal,
and does not desire to pose before the
publio either as a freak or as a glutton.
He is particularly undesirous of being
looked upon as a gourmand.
Miller Is slightly above the ordinary
height, not stout, but strong and wiry,
and has a record for other unusual per
formances than those of eating. He is in
the employ of the firm of Uri & Co. in the
Clay-street market, and is an expert in
the art of dissecting a beef or a calf. He
can also carry a greater weight of beef
and handle more of this food-stuff in a
given time than any man employed in the
local beefsteak factories.
He first began to show bis unusual pow
ers about a year ago. In July of 1895 a
friend called his ability into question by
offering to wager that Miller could not
make a meal of two dozen eggs. If Miller
succeeded in stowing away that quantity
in his main digestive organ the friend was
to pay for them and whatever Miller ate
at the same time. If Miller, however,
failed he was to stand the expense. Miller
won with ease, and this is what his doubt
ing friend had to pay for: A big plate of
soup, a huge dish of macaroni, a gen
erous helping of stuffed veal, a three
pound tenderloin steak, twenty-nine eggs,
two cups of coffee and a loaf of French
bread, garnished with Swiss cheese.
Miller's vanquished challenger was Joe

One of the latest additions to the Italian
colony of this City is Francis Majano, a
19-year-olrt boy, who appears to hare the
making of a good citizen in him. From
his conversation he has a most estimable
character and his aims are of the highest.
He says that he comes of one of the most
noble families of Italy which lost its posi
tion through devotion to freedom.
At present Francis is working for a fish
erman, ana spends a large portion of his
time on the wharf drying nets and doing
other work of a similar nature. But all
the while he is thinking of a way
to improve his mind, and all of
his spare time is given to study.
That the boy is smart Is a fact beyond
question, because he has been in this
country but ten weeks and has already
mastered the English language. He can
speak on any subject with a good accent,
although when he left his native land he
did not know a word.

and ever since Joe, as he is familiarly
called by the people of the. market, has
been trying to get even on his gifted em
ploye.
Shortly after Ernest had so thoroughly
demonstrated his gastronomic abilities
Wertheimer offered to wager $25 to $12 50
against the leg and lung power oi Miller.
Miller promptly accepted, and the follow
ing conditions were then arranged and
apreedupon: Miller was to walk to the
Almshouse and back from the Clay-street
market within three hours, and in the
courae of his jaunt smoke six good
sized imported cigars. In order to see that
the performance was duly accomplished
Wertheimer followed in a buggy. The dis
tance to the Almshouse -"is estimated at
five and three-quarters miles.
Four minutes and a half from the time
of leaving the market the corner of Mont
gomery and Market street was reached,
and here the stump of the second cigar
was banded to Wertheimer.
"I did not know what I could do in the
line of smoking when 1 started," said Mil
ler, in speaking of the incident, "and so I
puffed away like a locomotive getting up
steam in a hurry until I came to the end
of the second cigar. I had to smoke them
down to a stump of less than an inch.
The walking part of the contract was as
soft a snap as the smoking. I reached the
Almshouse in just one hour and three
minutes after leaving the starting point.

years old. But he had to work hard for
very little money, and it was a most diffi
cult matter to save enough to pay his
passage. He was desirous of coming to
San Francisco because he knew several
people, who have been here some time
and who have since his arrival been very
kind to him.
The forefathers of Francis Majano were
all men devoted to freedom and the in
stincts were born in the boy. He learned
all he could of the different governments
of the world from books in his own lan
guage, and after studying them all made
up his mind that that of the United States
suited him better than any of the others.
He at once began to prepare to come here
by saving what he could out of the scant
salary which he got for acting as delivery
boy in a market
The day when he had the sum was the
happiest of his life, and be lost no time
in getting started. It was a long journey
to an untraveled person, but Francis is
glad that he made it. fie sings over his
work and longs for the day when he shall
attain his majority and be eligible to be
come a citizen of this great country.
His desire is not simply to be admitted
to citizenship, but to be a good citizen
worthy of the privilege. He reads the
constitution and the Declaration of Inde
pendence constantly and says that they
are the greatest documents ever written.
He studies them carefully and it has never
struck him that they could be improved
by changing certain parts.
"What I would like to do," said Francis,
in but slightly broken English, "is to bo
come a lawyer or a physician. Then I feel
that I could be of benefit to the world. I
would show my people what a grand op
portunity they have when they are allowed
to become citizens of this great country.
Surely there could be no greater privilege,
and no other country in the world offers
the same chances for a man to rise.
â¢â¢After I have been here a year I will get
a position as a clerk where I can have
more time to study. I will also rind some
way to go to a school. Oh, I will do every
thing because this country does so much

had wanted I could have made the return
in about three-quarters of an hour, but I
took it easy coming back and stopped at
several places to take a drink. The half
dozen cigars were nearly all smoked when
I got out to the Almshouse."
Wertheimer's next attempt to get part
of his lost money back was to wager that
Miller could not smoke six imported cigars
within two and a half hours.
"I took him up for $5," said Miller.
Then in tones of sad reproach mingled
with triumph he added: "They soaked
the cigars in brandy and drugged them.
But it didn't matter, I got away with
them, and with time to spare.' '
Miller's last achievement in stowing
away sixty-six eggs so aroused the admir
ation of bis iriena* that they contributed to
the purchase of a belt, which was pre
sented to him last evening with ail due
formality. It designates him as the cham
pion destroyer of hen fruit and ib designed
to indicate the honor conferred upon the
wearer. The center of the buckle orna
mentation shows the convex side of half
an eggshell and grouped about it is a
flock of disconsolate and discouraged
looking denizens of the barnyard. One of
the conditions of the presentation is that
Miller shall wear the belt on all state
occasions, and this he has faithfully prom
ised to do.
Wertheimer still has hopes of being able
to recover some of his wagered dollars and
is devoting considerable of his t.me to de
vising some new gastronomic feat.

A Phenomenal Mem

Path
Gilbert Wat kins is the name of a blind
man who lives on Bush street, near Tay
lor. Although he is so blind be cannot
tell day from night, even though he looks
directly at the sun, it does not interfere
with his ability to travel. In fact Wat
kins does more traveling than most other
people, except drummers. And further
more he does the most of it without any
one to guide him.
Watkins, when he is in the City, can be
seen standing on the corners of some of
the downtown streets, where he sells no
tions and other small articles in order to
gain a livelihood. But he does not stay
long at a time, because te likes to visit
different places and meet different people.
He always attends the different celebra
tions a&d fiestas, where he says he is sure
to enjoy himself.
When Watkins wants to go any place
the first time he gets some one to guide him
if possible, but after that he can go alone at
any time he wishes. He has been over
nearly all of the roads in California, and
only a few months ago he walked from
this City to Los Angeles by himself. He
says he is always well treated and finds
people only too willing to tell him what is
going on.
According to Watkins' story he is able
to do these remarkable things solely by
his memory and says that he can be taken
anywhere and made to turn as many cor
ners as desired, and that he can find his
way back without assistance. In this re
spect be seems to have the same faculty a
cat is said to have and exercise it in the
same way.
When the blind man desires to go to a
certain place he has never been before he
is led to it and as he goes along he takes
mental note of all of the objects be passes.
Here is a rough crossing, here some as
phaltum pavement, here a dirt road with
some B tones on it, here some water, eta.
When he wants to return he takes them in
the reverse order and has no trouble.
"The reason I can do this," he says, "is
because I don't see a lot of things that dis
tract me. You could do the same thing
easy enough. Maybe in a miie I would
only have to remember a few objects. It
is just the same as if a man who could see
was taken through a dark alley but every
once in a while was given a glimpse of his
surroundings by a light being turned on.
He could remember what he saw without
any trouble, but if he saw a thousand
other things he could not I know just
how many steps it is from the corner to
where I live and can walk to the place
without even using my cane. Of course I
am helped a great deal by the people I
pass, because they know lam blind and

"From the clouds and winds that blow
out of the mysterious Antarctic, south of
us," said Clement L. Wragge, Chief
Weather Forecaster of all Australasia, at
the Palace yesterday, "we are gathering
facts so that we will ere long be able to
forecast the kinds of seasons we shall
have. â¢
"This will be very important informa
tion for the herdsmen, agriculturists and
fruit-growers. If they know whether it
will be a wet or a dry season and the de
tails of the storms that are to ensue they
can govern themselves accordingly, and
millions of dollars will be saved. I have
been at the head of the Weather Bureau in
Australia since 1887. Prior to that I had
charge of the hydrograohic station on
lofty Ben Nevin, in Scotland. In fact, I
established that station.
"Bince 1 took hold in Australia I have
given a great deal. of attention to the
strange things in meteorology. The Queens
land Government, of which I am the
meteorologist, some time since desired that
I would devote considerable time getting
facts looking to the correct prophecy of tne
seasons.
"I proceeded to make a large number of
cloud photographs, and I also gathered
data from observations taken by ships
covering the entire region from 40 degrees
north latitude to 55 south latitude, and
from 30 degrees east longitude to 130 west.
This takes in the Red Sea, the eastern part
of the Mediterranean, Arabia, Persia,
Afghanistan, India, Southeastern China,
Japan, Hawaii, the South Sea Islands,
Indian Ocean and the North and South
Pacific.
"The strange data collected have enabled
us to forecast the weather from one to six
teen days in advance of any given disturb
ance. We have found that when droughts
prevail in Australia abnormally heavy
rains occur in India.
"One of the thirgs ascertained was the
scientific fact of the extraordinarily low
pressure within the limit alluded to, with
the variations as indicated, and the ex
traordinary distribution of ice from the
Antarctic during the several seasons. All
this is most important in elucidating the
details in reference to the seasons.
"I hold, however, that, considering the
progress we have made, nothing would so
readily make clear a way toward a
complete forecasting as an Antarctic
meteorological expedition. That is some
thing of great importance. The Antarctic
is now the greatest field we have for ex
ploration, and at the meeting of the In
ternational Meteorological Congress in
Paris on (September 15. to which I am now
bound, I shall set forth the whole matter
in full.
"Queensland has waited to start an ex*
pedition to the Antarctic, but has been a
little slow, not having the money, l hope
one of these expeditions will get off ere
long. The wealthy men of the world have
a chance to immortalize themselves by
outfitting an expedition to the Antarctic.
"If this is done and trained meteorolo
gists are aboard, I have no doubt that all
the details will be collected which will en
able forecasters to tell to a certainty what
kind of seasons we shall have.
"As to this cloud photography I may
say that photography in meteorology has
become of as much use as photography in
astronomy. It is absolutely indispensable,
and the facts which we are enabled to get
from the photographs are settling with
wonderful rapidity many of the hitherto
great problems of the air.
"I am taking fifty of these cloud photo
graphs with me to Paris. They are large
and very beautiful. I think when all the
data I have gathered is laid before the
scientists there they will agree with me
that we may look into the future for
months and accurately foretell what is to
happen. The mystery of what was before
the unknown will be broken as by a
spell."
The great Australasian weather fore
caster left last evening for Paris. He is
full of enthusiasm reearding his discov
eries and the project of an Antarctic expe
dition.
"The word-coioring of your essay was
exquisite."
"Thank you."
"It matched so perfectly the green rib.
ton at your throat."
"Ob, thank you very much."
Thus conversed the two sweet girl
graduates, and revealed again the subtlety
of woman in grasping the esoteric signifi
cance of things.

I have tried some of the best physicians in San Francisco,

â¢ Since the writer of this letter signed his name and address apparently
in good faith, it is only fair to withhold them, a3 requested* aud accept
the letter at its face value. Possibly the name given does not represent a
real person, but that the circumstances set forth do describe about ths
conditions under which a very large percentage of all the suicides are com
mitted no observing person will deny.
And herein is involved the whole question of suicide. There is no
real difference of opinion as to the justification for or the morality or the
â utility of taking one's life exept under circumstances similar to those so
describedâ circumstance! wherein the sufferer of either mental or physical
torture has lost all hope this side the line that divides time from
eternity.
When sach a case is presented to the humanitarian whose logic does
not carry him beyona the surface of things he answers â o,uite hon
estly from bis standpointâ that it is better to die.
But I believe that hit standpoint is sadly erroneous and the agony of
the sufferer who follows his advice vastly increased. If nature is just
and life has any meaning at all, the greatest sufferer the sun ever shone
upon cannot better himself by forestalling the death that would otherwise
come to him in nature's own time. Who takes his own life breaks a law
of nature. And what is there in logic, in common-sense, in religion or in
philosophy to lead one to believe that he can escape the penalty of an in
fraction of a natural law? _
One may cry aloud that nothing can increase his tortures, since they
havo reached the limit of mind's or matter's capacity to suffer. But his
agonies may be prolonged ! Â»
\ot forever, for that is against logicâ unless one has already accepted
the dogma of eternal damnation. But why should a forced and unnatural
death be supposed to end the tortures? Is there anything in all natnre to
-jgeest that the infraction of one natural law will cure the effect of a prior
The simplest rules of logic Â»nd common-sense ought to be snfficient to
prove not alone the futility but also the monstrously evil effects of buicide.
Neither the priest nor the philosopher is needed so much these days, I
think, as a little clear and logical thought.
Look to the world about you. Is it not governed by the law of cause
and effect? If you place your hand on the hot atove there will be pain.
By chopping off the arm you may escape the barn on the hand. This is
the logic of him who believes suicide can be justifiedâ he would chop off the
arm to escape the burn. Using everyday business reason, however, we do
not amputate the arm until it becomes necessary to do so in order to save
the life.
The entire universe is ruled by this wonderful and yet quite common
place law of cause and effect. Were this law suspended for a single in-

STORY
My first official action was to decline the kind and urgent invitation
of a villainous-looking fellow-traveler to dine with him. The alluring
picture he painted of his home, the dark-eyed wife and daughter, the low,
cool adobe dining-room, etc, had no charms for me. He bade me an
affectionate and regretful farewell, and I breathed more easily when he
departed.
The day had been long and hot. At the so-called hotel I found but
poor facilities for washing, and to further my discomfiture the dinner
would not be ready for yet an hour. Sitting alone on the porch in the
deepening twilight a great home sickness came over me. I thought of
ail my past life, old days, old friends â of my mother and the girl.
I was now at last going home to marry; and in the midst of this
tender reverie came the great fear that I might never see them again. As
never before in all my long weeks' sojourn in Mexico I realized in what a
desperate situation I had placed myself and how precious was my life to
me. Perhaps it was the sight of a passing low-browed half-breed that
made me regret the absence of firearms. As I rose to answer the dinner
call I firmly resolved to possess myself of a weapon before I undertook
the drive to the border line.
A pleasant surprise awaited me at the dinner-table. Aside from an
exceptionally good spread I found a white mau, as 1 called him, a young
American telegraph operator, who had just arrived from San Juan under
the protection of a native guide and interpreter. We hailed each other
as brothers who meet in a foreign land and under the influence of jovial
companionship and some of the benign-faced landlord's vintage my
nervousness evaporated like a mist. He had expected to spend the night
at San Ramon and drive (the distance is about ten miles) to the border
line the next afternoon and thence take the tram to Dallas on the follow
ing morning.
"But." he said, "if it can be done sooner I will gladly change my
plans and accompany you. To tell you the truth (lowering his voice), I
am anxious to get rid of this guide, whom 1 strongly distrust. I've been
beastly uncomfortable the whole trip. I can't speak a word of Spanish,
and I know his interpretations are half falee. He is in league with every
low-lived ruffian in the country."
After dinner and a pleasant smoke on the piazza we scored with the
proprietor and shouldered our slender luggage. The landlord was ill
pieased with me for taking away his guest.wbom he had intended to cinch
well, and the guide took his dinner with an ugly grin.
"Here'" I cried calling him back as he was slinking down the narrow
street, "find a team to take us over," and he dexterously caught the coin
in his' teeth and disappeared.
"Will he do it?" asxed the operator. "I thought you had the team
""HVwflWve us the trouble of searching for one, though in truth one
would not be difficult to find. And as for trusting him-it means to him a
commission from the driver, so have no lear."
Sure enough before ten minutes had elapsed he drove up with a
sturdy comfortable conveyance. The driver was no exception to the rest
of the ruffians. I thought to please him with drinks and cigarettes, but ft
was evidently no acre than he expected. There was but little delay and
then we started The gaide had disappeared in that peculiar fashion com
mon to the greasers, a trick that makes one start at every sound. The
operator and I were both silent. We were eech thinking of home. The
mules were going at a blow gait. The town seemed rather large, and I
presently suspected that we had driven on a certain street more than once.
The operator was still wrapped in thought and had not noticed it. I said
-nothing, but kept very much on the alert. I inwardly cursed my negli
gence In not providing firearms, but observed with great relief that our
driver was alÂ»o unarmed.
Presently we reached a low quarter of the town. It was too late to
Btant the universe itself would collapse. Science teaches this and demon
strates it in a million different ways, while human reason proves it beyond
a!l possibility of contradiction. We can neither lift a tinger nor think
a thought without the aid of this law of cause and effect.
It is axiomatic that nothing comes from nothing. There is a cause
behind everything. The Absolute itself is beyond the comprehension of
man, but everything this side the Absolute has a cause. So it happens
that even human suffering has a cause, whether it be mental or physical
suffering or both. We see and feel the effects, but often the real cause
reaches too far back for us to tr ace it. Yet the cau*e exists.
In the thoughtless egotism or joy or grief we act often as though we
expected this law to stand aside for us. When passion eurge3 we forget its
operation. But shall .we say, when calmly reasoning, that we are greater
than nature and can set aside her laws? But we must eithei say this or
else admic that, "given a cause the effect will follow," and no power in
heaven or earth can or win stay it in order to permit U9 to escape the effect.
It is difficult, I know, for one to see the justice of this law sometimes,
particularly when it falls with force upon ourselves. But are we to deny
it simply for that? Usually, when we see its operation upon others it is
not so difficult to believe that the suffering is needed or deserved, or, at
all events, beneficial. Is it hard to believe that nature has no limitations,
while we have many? Her operations are very intricate ; we cannot see
them all. It is true, I believe, that to see broadly the jastness of this
governing law one should know something of that ancient system of
philosophy which taught the reincarnation of man upon this earth for
many successive lives. With such a philosophy one realizes the "eternal
titness of things" in the universe, and even the eternal justness of the law
of came and effect when ourselves are suffering the effects.
But the tormented man, dwelling on the borderland of insanity and
suicide, will not be likely to consider even the fundamental principles of a
system'of philosophy before acting. Nor is it absolutely necessary that
he should. He has only to ask himself whether he is greater than nature
and can hope to either escape the effect of a cause already in motion
before the effect has died in its own natural way, or can break a law of
nature and escape the penalty. There is but one answer to such a ques
tion.
Yet if an effect cannot be escaped it can and will be outlived. Unless
this thing within us that thinks and knows ceases its existence with the
body a supposition that no one seriously holds in this dayâ then there ia
no reason in all common-sense why any man should lose hope entirely.
Experience and logic alike prove to as that we can set in motion no causes
which are everlasting. *In order to keep on suffering throughout eternity
one would have to keep on breaking natural laws eternally.
If we burn oar hand, the pain dies away as soon as nature has re
paired the wrong we did. Nature ia kind. She goes about repairing all
our wrongs as fast as her keen sense of exact justice will permit. There
are some physical pains that last longer than others, some mental agonies
tnat die out more slowly than others. But all effects do cease. Experi
ence ana reason show this. Man, being finite, cannot set in motion an
infinite cause.
And suppose the effectâ the pain and the agonyâ last a lifetime?
There is still an eternity of lifetimes beyond. When death comes natur
ally death ends the "ills that flesh is heir to." Visible proof cannot be
brought for this statement, it is trueâ nor can the vibrations of the ether
about us be seen. To a thinking, reasoning animal there is higher proof
than can 03 sensed.
But who can tell the writer of this letter, the man who expects to be
come insane from his sufferings, what to do? Here is a task for a near-by
friend who has an ounce of common-sease and a pound of human sympa
thy to spare.
A distant writer can only vaguely suggest the concrete. However, doc
tors have before this predicted dire results that have never come to pass, and
the power of the human will is a thing to conjure with. Doubtless the man
who thinks much of approaching insanity, or any other ill, especially a
mental one, thereby increases the danger if not actually produces
the thing itself. Resolve not to become insane. Resolve to remain in
control of your reason in spite of aIL One can think the kind of thoughts
he wills to think. Think peaceful thought!, hopeful thou-nts, harmoLi
ous thoughts. These will help. They must help, for evsry cause has its
effect. Hope is the word, not despair. Hope is true ; despair is false.
Every effort counts, even though immediate failure seems to follow. Suf
fering brings wisdom and wisdom is lasting, and the grave is not the end.

THE SAN FBAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 30. 1896.
That Remarkable Case of
Deathlike Trance in Portland
The remarkable case of Mrs. Mary S. Albertson, who, as stated in a
telegram to The Call from Portland, Or., a few days ago, had been twice
rescued Irom a deathlike trance by the use of a galvanic battery and other
restoratives, is but one oi a rapidly increasing number of phsychical phe
nomena for which our modern science affords no explanation.
For many years the necessity for explanation was neatly evaded by a
denial of the facts. Science assured us that the laws of nature made them
impossible. Of what use, then, to investigate facts that could not be?
Why trouble ourselves about cases that only seemed to be genuine, but
which, according to all the laws of logic must have been due to some
hocus-pocus that was simply clever enough to deceive our senses? Conse
quently, no matter what the evidence might be, or bow reliable the wit
nesses, an adverse decision in advance discouraged all investigation.
Bat a flood of queer happenings cannot be pooh-poohed ont of exist
ence any more than a disease can be ignored when it becomes epidemic.
However unwilling we may be to believe that Dame Nature still has sur
prises in store for us, or to admit that we in this enlightened nineteenth
century still stand confounded before the mysteries of our own human
constitution, it is no longer possible to deny that there are facts connected
with the mind or soul ot man which are not explainable by any mechan
ical theory. Nor can we afford to ignore facts related to oar immediate
welfare by the light they throw on problems of mental and physical dis
orders. Indeed, the single danger of being buried alive while in a trance
condition is enough to make greater knowleage of such states exceedingly
desirable.
Though modern science has not yet investigated these realms of mys
tery there was an ancient science which did so. It had the merit, too, of
actually explaining, and without any evasion, all these psychological
problems. If any justification were needed for its presentation in these
latter days, surely we may fina it in this fact. At least, in the absence of
any other theory It is worth considering.
The ancients did not say man had a soul, tbey said he was a soul.
They viewed the soul, not the body, as the real man, and looked upon his
physical form as a temporary instrument in which he was destined to
work out a part of his necessary evolution. For the unregenerate man
the body was a prison; for the purified man, a temple. It is unsatisfied
desire, they said, that holds the soul .to its flesh. These desires are an
acting force that creates for the mind out of thoughi-stuff an ethereal body
which dwells within the physical body and serves as a link between it
and the mind, or thinker.
This astral body, as it is called, is the real seat of thought, of desire
and of sensation. These appear to belong to the body because tbey are
confined to it daring its periods of wakefulness and also because so many
of our thoughts and desires are interwoven with physical concerns. But
were tne body to be dissolved the astral form would still remain, and in
it the old thoughts and desires would continue.
Sleep has been poetically callea the twin brother of death, and er
tainly there is an analogy between the two states. In one, as in the
other, the tenses are at rest and consciousness is withdrawn from
objective concerns to subjective states. The soul ceases to have experience
in the body. It is absorbed in its memories, its Ideas, its longings. But
the dreamer Jives on. If his dream life is less rational than the waking
one it is simply because his ethereal form, which develops much more
slowly than the physical, is not yet so highly evolved, and is therefore a
less perfect vehicle for thought. This does not prevent It from being a far
more sensitive vehicle of perception. For this reason, though we think
badly in sleep, we often catch ideas or impressions that are finer than any
which come to as in waking hours.
While sleep is a normal mode of sinking into the subjective state for
rest, trance is abnormal. It has a closer resemblance to death. Not only
turn back now. The best course was silence and trust in divine Provi
dence. 1 expected every moment we would be assaulted. Strangers are
always suspected of having money or valuables, and the border greasers
first kill their man and then rob him. We stopped at an ill-lighted but
well-patronised saloon.
Our driver dismounted and entered it. I determined to make a bold
fight for life if necessary. The operator was pale with terror. He fully
expected to be murdered. I was wet with perspiration, but set my teeth
firmly and we both watched the door. Had I dared I would have seized
the reins and driven on, but there were a dozen skulkers on the street who
would have stopped it and shot us like dogs. After five minutes, which
seemed like five years, the driver reappeared with a companion, bota
buckling on' six-shooters.
"Why this delay?" I asked in a forced tone of impatience.
"The moon, senor," he answered. "We must wait for the moon,
which just rises."
The males broke into a trot and we soon cleared the town. I felt we
were in a bad position, indeed, but I hope I shall never again see a man as
frightened as the operator was. I myself thought my last hoar had come.
The roaa was easy and open but several miles ahead it broke into the
mountains. The greasers spoke but little to each other. I determined at
their first suspicious movement to reach forward and endeavor to possess
the assistant driver's weapon, which was quite within my reach. A dark
clump of trees appeared ahead.
"They will murder us there," I thought, and strained to keep my
self-possession and coolne??. We approached nearer and nearer until the
dark shadow fell upon the mules' heads, and then on the driver's, and
then upon my trembling companion and myself. We drove on in the
shadowâ a little more slowly, I thought. Beyond the trees I saw the
road again open, with the bright moonlight streaming npon it, and again
I resolved not to die like a dog. An abrupt halt and the driver leaped
out, his revolver in his hand.
The operator grasped my arm convulsively. His face was pallid even
in the shadow. I leaned forward slightly, one hand .on the operator's
knee and one ready to spring at the uncovered firearm in the seated man's
pocket. He was holding the reins, and I calculated my apparently unex
pected movement would startle him, which gave a possibility of his drop
ping the lines and the mules starting to run. In this confusion there
might be a chance for us.
The bait and the driver's action were sudden, but before he had time
to turn "Quentienes?" (What is the matter) I called out sharply.
There was no answer. I saw him raise the gleaming steel, and simul
TO REVIVE THE LOST MYSTERIES OF ANTIQUITY
0 MOST people the fact that a college of "occult science"
JSf^Â£^Â»J '" Â« to be founded in the United â - States would be an evi-.
J^W^d^' dence of a reversion to the dart ages, when black magic
W^^^KQ- ' was supposed to flourish, but the society which is about
jKaKfeMK <> erect this institution claims tnat it is a revival of the
$&***&?%*'* light and civilization of ancient times, says the Pnila
ess\i<^sA^ delphia Times. v That such an academy is ; to rise within
- - our borders, that America, which is the youngest coun
try of modern times, is to be the sacred ; center in which are to be taught
the mysteries of Osiris and Isis and of : the Greek, is the latest announce
ment from the inner school i of fheosophisu, and one which it has only
decided to make public within a very short time, v ; v "\
-'A* few weeks ago { there set out from America for a tonr around the
world a small band of theosophists, headed by Mr. Hargrove,' the presi
dent, and accompanied by Mrs. Tingley, who' holds the position of corre
sponding secretary, which once the post occupied by M me. Blavat
sky.' and which is one of the most * important in- the *' society. - These mis
in this condition is the mind withdrawn from outward activity, but the
vital functions also become impaired. Vitality slips away, leaving so
faint a spark in the motionless form as to make it appear dead.
Granting the existence of soul as an independent life, not a mere
aroma of the brain, it is quite logical to assume that it would enjoy still
greater freedom in the trance than in the sleeping state. Cessation of
physical functions snaps another cord which binds it to itt prison, for no
bodily sensation can then affect it. Mind is free to wander in its thought
world, to feast on happy memories, and to create in imagination the
forms of its dear ones. Consequently, its life is a continuance of the paat,
plus a realization of its aesires.
But there is infinite gradation in subjective states. All minds are not
alike, nor are all subjects in a trance state able to enjoy the same condi
tion. There are mental passions as powerful to bind the soul as are any
bodily desires. The miser hugs his gold even when his fingers have
relaxed their grip. The selfish man pursues, on his mimic stage, his
schemes for power or pleasure. The hater clings to visions of malice or
revenge. Briefly, the mind continues to act its accustomed part.
In these cases the entranced person is not aware of his condition, bat
like one in sleep, is oblivious to outward things. For this reason he be
lieves himself to be in action as before. In fact, it is a profounder sleep
that has fallen upon him, one so akin to death that those who have been
brought out of it may well claim that they have been "on the other side."
That is, on the threshold of "the other side," for slipping the body's
leash ia not all there is of death. As its experience does not cease, the
soul is gradually purged of its passions. Fresh incentives to desire are
not furnished by the subjective state, as they are by this world ; hence,
when old impressions are effaced the soul becomes pure. Th&t is, the
thinker ceases to be affected by passions of any kind. It becomes able to
live in a realm of thought over which no desire can again bring cloud of
longing or discontent Safe in its own "home" the thinker is bleat. In
its perfection this condition is what we call heaven. Some ancient phil
osophers called it devacban, the "region of the gods," those "islands of
the blessed" which man might visit even during earthly existence were
his soul pure enough to pass their crystal portal.
It is said that some of the purer souls do in trance reach to that lofty
consciousness, enjoying there a more vivid and blissful existence than
human minds can conceive. Although it is not possible for most of us to
verify this statement, it is consistent with the theory of soul that is under
consideration, and explains the beatific visions occasionally testified to by
those who have been entranced.
In other cases, when the subjects know what is going on around
them but are unable to move or otherwise to make the fact of their con
sciousness known to others, it would seem that the derangement is in the
physical rather than in the psychical nature. Instead of consciousness
being drifted into other states, it is the body that faila to respond to men
tal action. â¢
Health, whether mental, moral or physical, demands that due propor
tion be maintained between the various factors of our complex being. If
there is need that reason should govern the body, there is equal need
thet it should direct the astral or psychic nature. This is being rapidly
unfolded by the evolution of our race. Chiefly because it Is so little under
stood the curious arÂ« more eager to hasten its development than to learn
how to control it. This is the chief reason why ancient philosophy has been
revived in the West during the closing years of this century. Psychic
changes are inevitable, but they may be intelligently guided. So long as
intellectual and moral progress keep the lead we are assured by philos
ophy and by experience that the evolution of psychic faculties may be
accomplished without any sacrifice of mental or physical health.

taneously with the report I sprang on the second driver. The shot whizzed
by my ear and with a groan the operator fell to the bottom of the convey
ance. The attacked driver, before I could grasp his weapon, dropped the
reins and turned quickly in defense, and the startled mules bounded off.
Then we grappled for fully three minutes, the pistol still in his
hip-pocket. 1 felt his hot, mescal-fumed breath upon my cheek, and he
made desperate attempts to use his teeth. He was naturally the stronger
of the two, but liquor had stolen his strength, and just as I felt I was lost
his grasp weakened, and with one herculean effort I flung him from the
flying vehicle.
Saved 1 But for how long, I wondered. I thought the operator was
dying and every moment expected we would be dashed to pieces. It was
impossible to seize the leins. Ail I could do was to clutch my companion
with one hand and with the other try to keep from being thrown out of
the swaying wagon; and building on the wild supposition that we reached
the town before we were exhausted, what but a lynching rope awaited
me, for the greaser's wagon was well known on the road._
Another lurch and something hard .struck my foot*. I bent forward
and picked up the loaded six-shooter. Alas! Of whaj use was it to me
now? I might blow my brains out, I reflected. It only offered me a little
variety in the choice of death. I raised the weapon and as one inspired
took aim in the moonlight and sent a bullet through the head of one of
the mules. He reared on his haunches, and with marvelous rapidity 1
discharged all the chambers into the two animals. The first bit died in
stantly, but the other poor brute was only wounded, and in her freniy she
overturned the wagon, throwing us on a soft sandbank. I was a little
dazed by the fall, but that soon passed off, and I examined the operator's
wound. He was shot in the shoulder and was bleeding profusely. Con
sciousness had returned, and I fixed him as comfortably as I could,
which, poor fellow, was anything but comfort. The excitement of
the nieht had worn me out, and the operator was weak from loss
of blood.
My timepiece told a quarter of four. Our train left at six. How far
was it from San Anseimo, I wondered. We could not have been more than
seven miles from San Ramon when the attack was made, and surely we
must now be very near the border town. And who knew what wild tale
the greaser would tell at San Ramon? The operator was young and of slen
der build. My one chance lay in risking the distance and catching the
train. Once over the border we were safe. With but little hope in my
heart, I lifted him. He felt as heavy as a thousand pounds, and the pain
in raising him sent him into unconsciousness again. It took me fully two
hours to walk that half mile to town, butâ we caught the train.
sionaries are called the crusaders, and they propose to go into every land,
planting the seed of their doctrine in every nation. This doctrine, which,
they claim is to be the future belief of the American people, is not a mod
era sect, bat a faith which was born ia prehistoric times, lived in its glory
daring the civilization of ancient Egypt and Greece, and was practiced
even on the continent of America, when it was the Atlantis which existed
before the dawn of history. They assert that these doctrines have de

cially in Thibet and India, where the learned occultists live.
Over |36,000 has been already subscribed toward the erection of the
"School for the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity," but the
site has not yet been announced for the reason that the holders of the
desired land would raise their prices if they were aware of the wish of
the society to purcnase the property. It is supposed that the building
will be begun next spring, and that within its walls those who wish to
belong to the Inner School will be here instructed free of charge in thÂ«
wonders of occultism, which the adepts possess.

THE AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHER AND HIS MISTAKES
Few people have any idea of the vast
amount of money that is being spent by
amateur photographers in San Fran
cisco. Unlike the bicycle-rider, the ex
penses of tbe camera devotee have only
commenced after he has paid for his
outfit. These can be obtained at prices
varying from $5 tos. r )00, but the expense of
a picture with a cheap camera is the same
as with an expensive camera of the same
size.
Tbe amount of money invested in
cameras by amateurs in San Francisco is
almost impossible to approximate, as hun
dreds have been, purchased by sending di
rect to the manufacturers. Still it can
safely be placed at $100,000. But as das
been stated, this is the smallest part of
the business.
Many amateurs simply make the expos
ures and have the developing and print
ing done by men who make a business of
such work.
A visit to one of the largest of these
places in the City last week revealed the
fact that 2000 negatives had been devel
oped by them in six days. The cost of the
sensitive plates, or films, ranged in price
from 2 cents each to 30 cents each, or say
on average of 10 cents apiece. This would
make $200 for the 2000 negatives. The cost
of developing is about the same as the
cost of a piate, which would make $200
more. Then comes the printing, which is
also about the same, making another $200,
or a total of $600. As there are three
places in town that do as large a business
as the one in question, and any number of
smaller ones, $2500 a week is not too high
for work done this way.
The next class of amateurs to be consid
ered are those who do all the work them
selves, and their name is legion. The only
expense they are to is for plates, chemi

jioW JMot to Arrange
the Harness for
Driving DoWn
the Hill
A kind-hearted man recently borrowed
my pet driving animal with which to go
on a journey. I knew him to be a kind
hearted man, or I should never have com
mitted my equine friend to his care, but I
was fated to learn, for the hundredth
time, I suppose, that
Evil is wrought by want of thought
As well as by want of heart
In the kindness of his heart her new
driver desired to make Madame as com
fortable as possible, and so in the interests
of mercy he buckled the harness girth very
loosely. The same good intention
prompted him to let out the holdbacks,
that the breeching might not chafe her.
Then with a light spring-wagon and a
camping outfit he departed iuto the
mountains.
It was a very hot day. The loose
breeching was of no avail for holding back
the load, and during every descent the en
tire weight bore upon the saddle. This
would have been bad enough had the
girth been snug enough to hold the saddle
in place, but it was not. nor was the shaft
band tight enough to keep the shafts
steady. Back and forth, from side to side,
all day long the saddle-pad kept up a
ceaseless chafing on the mare's back, and
by evening it was bruised and sore. Then
the Harness was taken off. she was well
watered and fed and left to enjoy a good
night's rest, but her tired back got no taste
of the brush. The second day was a
repetition of the first, and when camp was
made Madame's back was found to be
badly blistered. What was to be done?
The fence-rails and rocks, the trees and
dead- walls for miles along the way had
abounded in the praises of a wonderful
liniment which all horsemen were ad
vised to use. Eureka 1 We will have
some! And so soon as it could be pro
cured the strong, blistering stuff was well
rubbed in on the already blistered flesh.
It was similia similibus curantur, with a '
vengeance, only "similia" and "similibus"
were both too strong and the "curantur"
was effected by tne one obliterating the
other, like Aaron's rod, tnat swallowed
up the rest When next I saw my favor
ite it was evident to me, before I was near
enough to touch her, that something was
wrong. The signs of distress which the
equine countenance hangs out are unmis
takable, and they were all there, together
with well-expressed reproof for me that I
should ever have exposed her to such suf

It seemed hard, and yet I see horses on
the streets of San Francisco every time I
go downtown who are enduring quite as
much, as she did on that. trip. These
warm days are particularly hard on our
faithful equine servants, and we owe it to
them if we cannot lighten the burden at
least to fit it to the back as Intelligently as
may be. The backs and shoulders of our
City workhorses show, more often than
not, unmistakable Mg!:s of neglect. Nor
are the animals, in the majority of cases
at least, properiy harnessed. I saw a
horse tied on Market street some time ago
whose harness nad twisted about until the
saddle-pad rested upon his side. His back
was badly chafed where the leather pad
rubbed, all day, as he traveled up and
down over cobble-paved hills. In nine
cases out of ten the breeching is too loose
for hill work. It is a bad thing to have
this part of the harness too tight, as then
it can materially shorten a horse's stride j
and by that much increase his labor, but
it should be tight enough to carry the i
load en a dowr. grade, as otherwise all the
weight comes upon the tugs, which, sus
pended from the saddle, bear directly i
upon the back just behind the withers.
The shaft bands should always be buckled I
snug, and should come back of the tug i
loops. It is a bad plan to wrap the shaft )
straps about the shafts so that they come j
cals and paper. But aside from the time
they give to the work $2500 would hardly
pay for the material. These calculations

the same negative. It will be thus seen
that $5000 a week would not cover what
the amateur photographers have been
spending for the last lour months. In the
winter months the work drops off to al
both before and behind the tug loops.
Fastened thus they are apt to pinch up
the skin against the bellyband, and often
make a bad sore.
It is always a good plan, with heavy
workhorses, to leave collars and saddles
on, when the rest of the harness is re
moved, until the back and shoulders are
thoroughly dry beueath them. This is a
tolerably sure preventive against sore
backs and shoulders, but whether it is
done or not, no horee should ever be left
for the night until all places where the

Tbe breeching is too loose and lets the weight of the vehicle come on tfce straps (called

harness touches are well gone over with a
stiff brush. The currycomb should not be
used. It is a harmful and unnecessary
adjunct to a horse's toilet. A card should
be used in cleaning the mane and tail, and
for the rest a stiff brush and a whisk
broom, well used, are sufficient to cleanse
the coat and keep the skin healthy.
But when, through carelessness or igno
rance, injuries are permitted to come on a
horse's shoulders or back there are reme
dies less severe and more effective than
burning liniment, however well blazoned
over the landscape. Treatment in each
case should be based upon the conditions.
If you have a simple gall, which in its na
ture is a bruise of the trne skin, with
swelling and tenderness, arnica lotion is
the best remedy. It should be in about
the proportion of one part oi the tincture
to six of water, applied by means of a soft
cloth, which should be kept upon the gall
and saturated every two or three hours.
If there is abrasion of the skin, with per
haps injury to the tissues beneath, apply
benzoin ointment thrice daily, Later,
when the soreness is gone, if the hair
has come off to any extent, the parts
i should be kept well anointed with vase
line or crude petroleum, to prevent the
new hair from coming in white. The fluid
extract of logwood is also said by old
horsemen to be admirable for this pur
pose, but I have never seen it tried.
Sometimes, instead of the ordinary gall,
you will have to treat what is called a
â¢' warble," a soft, movable tumor under
th^skin, small, but painful. They are
very apt to come under the collar or under
the riding-saddle when a rider sits un
evenly. The common Californian trick of
riding with the weight thrown more upon
one stirrup than the other is a capital
scheme for producing warbles on a horse's
withers. Left to itself the little swelling
breaks in time, but it is better to treat
it. This is best done in the case of
saddle or collar injuries by puncturing,
squeezing out the contents and rubhing in
arnica or calendula lotion. Sometimes,
however, lumps similar to warbles will be
found on the hips and back, caused by the
sting of the gadfly, who then deposits her
ejrgs. In this case they should be opened
and a weak solution of carbolic acid in
water used instead of the arnica or calen
dula lotion.
Neglected saddle-galls or warbles will in
time form sitfasts, troublesome, painful
and hard to cure. The sitfast comes when
the injured skin hardens and becomes in
sensible. It loosens about the edges but
forms a deep sore, at the bottom ot which
it is held fast by a sort of root and kept
â¢live by the blood supply to the part. It

Girth galls sometimes form and need
only to be fomented and kept clean, when
they will disappear, but a saddle gall of
the withers should never be neglected. If
it is the result is likely to be fistula of the

trouble, indeed. All is not fistula of the

even by experienced horsemen. Fistula

produced to pay for this vast outlay ? The
question can be answered both ways. If
the securing of photographs of almost

If the work simply be considered as "pic

of the negatives secured by travelers of

may be valueless as pictures from an
artistic standpoint.
In looking over the 2000 pictures men
tioned at the beginning of this article
there were not 50 real godd pictures in the
lot and not over 200 that had the cfairc to
the title. The rest were all failures, for
one, or all, of a dozen different reasons.
Exposure was bad, developing bad and
plates were bad, but the greatest cause of
failurs was the injudicious selection of
subjecte. The negatives looked as if the
people who took them had simply
"snapped" at whatever was in front of
their cameras.
Among the lot of pictures mentioned
there was a batch of 300 taken by a young
lady while on a tour through Mexico.
Photographically considered the work was
almost perfect. She had used a 6%xÃ>Â£
camera of the most perfect pattern that
$150 could buy and she got clean, sharp
negatives, but she did not have a picture
in the whole batch of 300. The plates, de
veloping and making one print from each
negative cost her over $100.
Why did she fail to get pictures? Sim
ply because she didn't have tbe art in her.
It takes as much art to select a subject for
a photograph as it does for a painting;
that is, if you want to make pictures. If
you simply want to make a negative of the

art at all, tnd there won't be any art in the

ATHLETIC RECORDS
Useful Data for JKose Interested
ir\ Outdoor Ev>er\ts.
Continuing my list of records, we come
now to running times for less than a mile.
One-quarter mile (440 yards) has always
been popular. America has the honor of
holding the best performance. Wendell
Baker covered the distance in 47% sec
onds on a straightaway track at Boston
on July 1, 1886. However, the best per
formance in this country on an ordinar}'
curved track Is 48%. at Philadelphia, by
Myers, October 15, 188 L England's best
time is 48% by a professional, R. Buttery,
at Newcastle, on October 4, 1873. Almost
equal to, this is the magnificent perform
ance of H. C. L. Tindall, at the champion
ship meeting hold at London on July 29,
1889, 48}Â£ seconds. The same time has
been credited to E. C. Bredin, I under
stand, at London, June 22, 1895. The best
record for the Pacific Coast is 50 3-5 sec
onds, by J. T. Belcher, in Oakland, October
9, 1880. The fastest of late years is 51}^
seconds, by E. Mays.
600 yards, or nearly three furlongs,
has been somewhat popular among
amateurs, and it will be noticed that the
records are of a truly remarkable char
acter. On July 1, 1882, I had the pleasure
of seeing L. E. Myers beat the record for
tliis distance. It was on the old polo
grounds in New York, and he accom
plished the distance in 1:112-5. Strange
as it may seem W. C. Downs on May 17,
1890, ran the same distance in exactly the
same time in the same city. But the
extraordinary part of the affair does not
end here, for on June 10, 1893, E. C. Bredin
ran the distance also in 1:11 2-5 in London,
surpassing Tindall's best English record
of 1 :12. The professionals are cast in the
shade by these performances, as the best
they have been able to do was on February
20. 18/54, when James Nuttall ran at Man
chester, England, in 1:13, nearly thirty
years ago.
We now come to the distance that is
justly considered one of the most popular
on any athletic programme, viz.: the half
mile or 880 yards. As in the quarter mile

To tbe amateur photographer there is
only one bit of advice to be given, and it
was given to the professional over twenty
years ago â "study your ground glass."
Manning covered the distance at Boston
October 13, 1879, in 2m. 00 3-ss. The ama
teur record for this coast is exactly the
same by Bert Coffin, May 5. 1894.
On October 18, 1881, I had the pleasure
of seeing L. E. Myers run 1000 yards on
the old polo grounds in New York in
j 2:13. Everybody considered it a remark
able performance at that time, and our
judgment has been substantiated by the
lapse of time, for it still stands the best
on record in the world, barring none.
William Cummings, the great professional
runner, made an effort at this distance
once, but 2:17 was the best he could do at
Preston, England, April 30, 1881. W. G.
George, when an English amateur, did his
best to lower it at London on September
27, 1884, but could only reach 2:16. W-
Pollock-Hill managed to shave a fifth of a
second from that on March 8, 1889, but he
could only make it 2:15 4-5. This was
done at Oxford. . Thus 2:13 stands to-day,
and no one has been able to approach
within 2 4-5 seconds of that wonderful
time. The best record on this coast is
2:24 by P. D. Skillman.
Three-quarters of a mile has attracted
more or less attention, although it is an
odd distance. The best time ever made
for 1320 yards was accomplished by
Thomas P. Conneff, an Irishman by birth
and an American by adoption. This was
done in 3:02 4-5 on Travers Island, August
21, 1895. England's professional record
stands next, for on June 30, 1866, before
the present generation of active athletes
was born, William Richards covered the
distance in 3:07 at Manchester, England.
The best by an English amateur is 3:08%
by W. G. Georee before his retirement
from the amateur ranks.
The one-mile run is the great standard
distance and measures 1760 yards. The
greatest time ever made was on August 23,
1886, when George ran the course in 4:12%
at London. This was after he became a
professional. Conneff ran the distance in
4:15 3-5 at Travers Island on August 30 of
last year. T< ebest amateur record in Eng
land is 4:17, by F. E. Bacon at London.
July 6. 1895. The professional record for
America is 4:28)4. at Ottawa by J. Raine,
May 24, 1881. The best time for this coast
was made on June 27 of this year by W. E.
Tailant at Portland, Or., 4:31 3-5. The best
on record for California is 4:36, by David
Brown on May 30, 1894.
As the last that was mentioned was one
mile, we will, therefore, take up the two
mile run. We rind that the professional
lead at this distance, for the best on record
is 9 minutes \l% seconds, by William Lange
at Manchester, Eng., as far back as August
1, 1863. W. G. George ran this distance
while an amateur, at London, on April
26, 1884, in 9:17 2-5. The best performance
in America is 9:32 3-5, by W. D. Day, in

Next in order is the three-mile run. The
best that has ever been done for this dis
tance is 14:19)4 by P. Cannon, in Scotland,
town of Govan, May 14, 1888. In England
a professional by the name of J. White

teur Thomas, who ran the distance at
London, June 3, 1893, in 14:24. The rec
ords of amateur and professional in this
country are the sameâ l 4:39. W. D. Day,
an amateur, ran in this time at Bereen

Four-mile run. The best performance
ever made at this distance is 19:25 2-5, by

Quite close to this stands the English ama

record of this country is 20:12}Â£. by James

subjects for a photographer in existence,
and it is very likely that more negatives

Funerals
There are at least 200 people walking the
streets of San Francisco, in good health
and likely to live many years, who have
already arranged the details of their
funerals. They have selected the coffins
in which they will be buried and paid
cash for the same, as well as for the
burial plat, hearse, etc.
Nearly every undertaker in the City has
several contracts of this kind, and all of
them are made by people who are sup
posed to be in rational frames of mind.
Age seems to cut no figure, for some of the
contracts are signed by men in the prime
of life, who are noted for their cheerful
ness and good dispositions. They have
simply provided for their funerals to as
sure themselves that they will have decent
interment. The undertakers think it
nothing out of the way, but look upon it
as sensible forethought. And according
to stories told it has proved so in many
cases. Men without families have dropped
dead on the street, and had it not been'for
their arrangements with the undertaker
they would have been buried in the pot
ter's field.
Some people have made arrangements
for the minutest details of their funerals,
even to the advertisements in the news
papers. There are a few people who have
not been content with selecting their
coffins, but have had them sent to their
homes. Such cases are rare, however.
"Yes: I have a good many contracts of
that Kind," said Undertaker Metzler when
speaking of the matter, "and in a great
many cases they have proved to be eood
things. It is a sensible thing for anybody
to do who has not a family to look alter
them when they are gone.
"1 have coffins in those cases there," said
he, pointing, "that were contracted for at
least six years ago and paid for at the
time. It may be six years or sixteen years
before they are wanted, but when the
owner needs them they will be ready, and
I will fulfill every part of the contract.
"It is not so long aeo since I fulfilled a
contract of this kind after I had had the
contract several years. When the man
made it he looked ready to die, and no
doubt thought he would live only a few
months.
"In this case the casket was a fine one
and he â¢ paid cash for it. He also made
arrangements for the grave, hearse, car
riages, â  shroud and every little detail.
He left letters saying that I would be his
undertaker, and of course I was notified
at once and did all I agreed to.
, "But there are cases when I have to
find out about the person's death myself.
I always keep watch of those events, of
course, and as soon as I know of a case
I have been paid for I so at once and

HOW ALECK
SAVED
"There's no use in figuring, Manay; un
less I get the pension and the back pay
we'll lose the place,'' said Mr. Jenifer,
gloomily, as he pushed away the pencil
aim paper. Mrs. Jenifer looted at her
husband blankly. "Is it as bad as that,
Hiram?" sfce asked.
"There's no help tor it," replied Mr. Jen
ifer "The mortgage company at Omaha
will foreclose the mortgage on the ranch
unless the note is paid. The wheat and
the corn are harvested, and at outside
prices won't meet the note by $200."
There was silence for a few minutes,
broken only by the click of Mrs. Jenifer's
knitting-needles.
"What did chat pension lawyer at Wash
ington write in his last letter about the
prospects of your claim getting through?"
she a ked.
"Why, you know Khat he wrote, Mandy.
He said there were 3000 or 4000 cases
ahead cf mine, and that the Pension Bu
reau is very strict about considering cases
in their regular order. He said it might
be ever a year before they reached mine.
When it is taken up, though, be thinks I'll
get the pension and the back payâ that's
about $3000, you knowâ for the proof is all
right and I have a clear case under the
law." ,
"It seems kind of hard that, if the Gov
ernment is going to give you the back pay
some time, you can't get it in time to save
the ranch from being sold over our heads,"
sighed Mrs. Jenifer.
"Yes, and the hardest part of it is that
they do sometimes take up cases out of
order," replied her husband, "but the law
yer said it requires influence to have that
done, or some one must show the Com
missioner of Pensions that there is a
special reason ior it. I have no influence
away out here on a Nebraska ranch. I
can't Â«yen get down to Washington to
plead my own case. There really seems to
be no help for us."
During the course of this conversation
there had been an interested but silent lis
tener on the opposite side of the table,
who now arose and passed through the
kitchen door. T.iis was Aleck French,
Mr. Jenifer's nephew. He sat down on
the bench outside and looked across the
dussy prairie, lying grim and still in the
moonlight. In one direction a group of
scattered lights showed the location of the
railway and the station.
"If they only knew all about it at Wash
ington," he thought, "1 am sure they
would ta!:e up our case first. Oh, if I could
only go to Washington and tell them !" A
"No, it won't do," said his Aunt, sadly.
long time he sat there thinking, with his
chin, in his hands, looking out over the
prairie. As he gaped he saw a light some
distance away moving rapidly along. He
knew It was the headlight of a locomo
tive, for he bad often watched them,
miles away, creeping over the level
piain. Soon he could hear tlie rum
ble of the cars, and by the absence of
lighted windows, knew that it was not a
passenger train. When it stopped at the
station the lowing of the cows and some
discordant squeals and grunts told him it
was a stock train bound for Chicago.
Everyday these long stock trains pas-ed,
and sometimes they stopped while the
cattlemen fed and watered the live cargo.
The* cattlemen always accompanied the
train, and Aleck had often envied the lot
of the young men who were going to see
the great city.
Then an idea came to Aleckâ the possi
bility of doing something to save the
ranch. He Â«oon stole away to his b?d,
wherp he fell asleep think ingÂ«bout it, and
took it up again eariy next morning when
he went to feed the stock.
After breakfast he went into the kitchen,
where his aunt was washing the dishes.
I There he told her his plan, growing en
thusiastic ; n the recital. He wanted to
! go to Washington and tell the Commis
sioner of Pensions the story of their
troubles, and ask him to ac, upon his
uncle Hiram's claim at once. As he
talked she, too, became interested, and
her wan face was lighted up for a moment
iby hope; but she boon became grave
i again.
"But, Aleck, we could not spare even
$5 to buy your food on the way, for per
haps your plan niight fail. No. it won't
do/ said bis aunt, shaking her head.
Aleck went out of tae kitchen with a
heavy heart and walked toward the barn.
When he reached the gate his own little
pony, Brown Bess, came running to the
bars and affectionately thrust her nose at
him to be stroked. As he patted the
! mare's head another idea came to him.
i In a moment he was in the harness-room,
tugging at his saddle on the hook; and
five minutes later he was calloping over
the prairie toward the station. Up the
principal street be rode without drawing
rein until he stopped before the postoffice.
Mr. Brand, the Postmaster, was standing
at the delivery-window as Aleck came in,
and seemed surprised to see him.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 30, 1896.
giied by
AARV-W-Ricittims
"Why, Aleck, there ain't any mail this
time of day," he began.
"I didn't come foT ma il," Aleck replied.
Then he continued hastily: "Mr. Brand,
yoo offered me s2o for Brown Bess two
months ago and I refused to sell her."
"Yes, that's 66."
"Well, I've come to take your offer.''
''Why, what's tbe matter now, Aleck,
that you are so anxious to sell?"
"I need the money," answered Alex,
choking back a sod.
Mr. Brand came out and looked at the
horse. After some further talk the bar
gain was concluded and Aleck started out
of the postoffice with four $5 bills. Before
he reached the door, however, he said :
"Mr. Brand, is your son George still a
postal clerk on the railway?"
"Ye 3, Aleck; his 'run,' as they call it, is
from Chicago to Pittsburg.' 1
As Aleck left the postoffice he passed by
his pony still hitched to the rack arid
Brown Bess neighed in an inquiring man -
ncr as he went down the street as if to say :
"Where areyou going without me, Aleck?"
But he hurried on without looking back.
Reaching home, however, he slipped id the
back way, and climbing into the loft of
the barn, lay face down in the hay and
cried as if his heart would break as he
thought of the empty stall below him.
Great was the astonishment of Mr. Jen
ifer that evening when his wife revealed to
him Aleck's plan; and when the lad laid
the four $5 bills on the table before him
his surprise was complete. Far into the
night they talked it over, for it was a
momentous step in a young boy's life.
Finally Mr. Jenifer settled it. "I'll let
you go, Aleck; it's to save the'Tanch, and
may God bless you, boy."
On the evening of the third day after the
sale of Brown Bess, Aleck French was at
Chicago in the office of the division super
intendent of the Railway Mail Service.
George Brand, the Postmaster's son, was
with him, and they were anxiously await
ing a reply from the gray-haired, stern
looking official who sat at the desk before
them.
"It is very unusual to permit any one
to ride in the postal car," said the super
intendent, gravely.
â¢I know it, sir," answered Brand, "but
this is a special case. Aleck would not ask
it, and I would not, sir, if it w ere not to
save the ranch."
Here George told the story of Aleck's
'acriheeof Brown Beas in his efforts to
help his uncle, and of the difficulty he had
experienced in eettinjj to Chicago. "I
only ask that you 'deadhead' him to
Pi ttsburg in my car," concluded Brand,
in an appealing voice.
"Well, you are a brave boy, and I will
do it," said the superintendent, "and I'll
make it good at Washington."
He Saw the Pouch Beneath a Heap of Ashes.
A few moments later the boys left the
room with a pass in the superintendent's
own writing. Aleck had com* to Chicago
on a stock train in the care cf a neighbor
who was bringing a trainload of cattle to
the market, earning his passage by help*
ing the men feed and water the cattle on
the train. *
When they reached the depot and
climbed into the postal car Aleck was first
introduced to the clerks. Then he made
himself comfortable upon a pile of empty
sacks, while Brand, who was the clerk in !
charge cf tLe registered mail, began bis ,
work of checking the poaches. He told
Aleck that these sacks contained money
and valuable packages and that in one of
them were several hundred thousand dol
lars going to the United States Treasury.
"I'll keep my eye on that pooch, I tell
you," laughed Brand, and Aleck's eye
opened wide at the idea of so much money
so near him. The next afternoon they
arrived at Pittsburg and the mail for
Washington was transferred to another
car. Aleck was sorry to part with Brand,
but found his new acquaintances very
pleasing fellows* He saw the registered
pouch with the treasury money in it
stowed away beside the registry clerk's
rack. That pouch seemed like an old
iriend, and he felt that he almost had a
personal interest in its safe delivery.
That night the train was running down
tha eastern slope of the Allegheny Moun
tains, swinging around the curves at a
lively rate. Aleck was still awake, curled
up on his pile of sacks in the reeistry
clerk's end of tbe car, wondering how
many pensions could be paid out of the
money in that registered pouch. Then
there "was a sudden jarring under the car
and a terrible crash. The lights went out
and Aleck felt himself rolling over and
over, with mail sacks under and above
him. There was an awful stillness for a
moment; then the silence was broken by
groans and cries of pain. Aleck tried to
raise himself, but found both legs pinned
down by a great piece of timber. He
could see nothing for a few minutes; but
presently, through the twisted mass of
wreckage above he saw the light of a lan
tern and heard voices.
"Helpl help! Here I ami" shouted
Aleck.
The ring of an ax and the sound of crash
ing timber told him that help was coming,
and in five minutes more a hole had been
made above him. A man passed down to
him a saw, with which he soon severed
the beam that held him. Scrambling out,
he found himself on top of the ruins of the
mailcar and the baggage-car. The engine
and two cars had jumped the track and
rolled down a steep embankment, but the
breaking of the coupling had kept the re
mainder of the train on the track. The
engineer and fireman were badly hurt, and
every man in the baggage and mail cars
had been bruised and scratched; but, for
tunately, all bad been dug out of the
wreck.
It was none too soon, for the wreck had
taken fire, and one end was now blazing
briskly. While the passengers and train
men were grouped arottnd Aleck, who was
the last one taken out, the registry clerk
came up to them crying: "Oh, where is
that registered pouch with the treasury
money ? There is $300,000 in that wreck."
Like a flash it came to Aleck that the
pouch wa3 near him when the car rolled
over. Without a word he dropped back
into the hole from which be had jnst
emerged, and in a moment was groping
for the pouch.
It was not so dark down there now, for
the burning wreckage, not twenty feet
away, cast a ruddy glow through the mass
of twisted iron and splintered wood. By
this light he finally saw the pouch beneath
a heap of sacks, and began tugging and
hauling at the pile. He heard the crowd
above shouting to him to return, and saw
the flames licking up the inflammable
wreckage close at hand. At last ha
loosened the pouch, and in another mo
ment had clambered out of the hole, drag
ing the bag after him.
The Postmaster-General at Washington
sat in his office talking to four men and a
boy who were standing before him. The
men had bandages around their heads;
their faces were seamed with court plaster,
and the boy had strips of court plaster
uiiou both hands and across the bridge of
his nose.
"So this is the boy who saved the regis
tered pouch, is it?" said the I'ostmaster-
General, looking kindly at Aleck.
"That's the boy," replied the registry
clerk, who then related the details of the
story, and toid of their arrival in Wash
ington that mornins upon the relief train
sent to tbe wreck. The great man listened
attentively, and seemed much interested
in the account of Aleck's scramble after
the treasury pouch.
"But how did this boy happen to be in
the postal car?" he asked. Then Aleck
in a straightforward manner told his story,
from the time he had resolved to pet his
uncle's pension, and in simple language
pictured the trouble hanging over the
Nebraska ranch. "And now I've come to
Washington to try to rind some one with
influence to help our pension case along,"
said he in conclusion.
"You shall have it, my boy," aaid the
Postmaster-General, and he took Aleck's
hand in his own and pressed it warmly.
Then he told his messenger to call his car
riace and drove with Aleck to the Pension
Bureau, where they were immediately
shown into the presence of the Com
missioner of Pensions. There Aleck bad
to tell bis story over again to the Com
missioner.
"And now, Mr. Commissioner," eaid the
Postmaster-General, "I ask you to take up
this pension case as a favor to me. This
boy has saved the Government $300,000,
and it is as little as we can do to help him
in this way."
The Commissioner said he would be glad
to do so, and promised to have Mr. Jeni
fer's claim examined at once.
That same night Alex left for home,
traveling on a Pullman car and on a pass
which the Postmaster-General procured
for him. There was great rejoicing in
that little home in Nebraska when he re
turned, and when, one week later, Mr.
Jenifer's draft came and was cashed at the
bank the first money used was to buy
Brown Bess from Mr. Braua. â St. Louis

THE NEXT BIG TEMBLOR
Seismic Disturbances Occur Periodically
and Coincident With the Planetary
positionsâ No jPart of the Qlobe
Exempt From JKem
Â» ' But few places, if any, are exempt from
seismic disturbances. A region may for a
long period enjoy immunity from earth
quakes, and then without warning there
occurs a fhaking up more or less <!risas
trons. It is within the memory of a good
many present residents of San Francisco
to recall the great earthquake of October
21, 1568, the destructive character of which
shown by the picture of the Webber
House. That our City may again be the
recipient of a similar if not a more severe
" visitation is within the bounds of possi
bility. All information upon the subject
of a general character must therefore be
of much interest. We sbali learn nothing
about any physical phenomenon by the
presentation of highly colored descrip
tions of imaginary conditions. No one
has penetrated the earth's crust to a
greater depth than a few thousand feet.
How, then, is it possible for the artist to
represent the appearance of the interior of
the earth? The verdict of science is that
the earth is a cooling globe. This implies
that at one time the ball we inhabit was
very hot, probably in a molten state, but
just bow long ago it got cool enough to
permit the appearance of life upon its
surface, or just how thick is the earth
crust at the present time, are questions
that science is unable to answer.
A ereat many ingenious theories have
been put forward concerning the internal
condition of the earth, each of which has
its particular merit, and ail have their fail
ures. By some it is held that the earth is
a liquid ball, having a thin crust or shell,
and the liquid interior is intensely not.
By others it is staled that the center of the
earth is a solid nucleus, or ball, floating in
an envelope of semi-liquid, viscous,
molten matter, which is coated by the
solid crust. Still others maintain the
earth to be a hollow shell. Tney are all
theories; and likely to be for all time un
determinable ones. Were it possible to
possess accurate knowledge of the con
dition of the earth's interior, we should
then be in a position to determine the
causes of earthquakes; as it is. without
sucli information we can only assemble
the observed phenomena attending these
geological catastrophes, and attempt to
deduce therefrom a few generalizations
bearing upon the subject.
E.irthquaKes and volcanic eruptions are
opt to be considered as related one to the
other. There is no necessary connection
between the two, other than both are the
effect of one great cause. Yet earthquakes
are most likely to occur in voicanic
regions. Earthquakes are generally due
on land to rupture of the strata of the
earth, upward or downward, consequent
on hoiizontal pressure. New England has
no trace of volcanic activity during the
present geological epoch, yet earthquakes
occur there. Moreover, it is reasonable to
suppose that if earthquakes were the re
sult of a confined power, such as gases at

Â» lAV I COMPANYâ My baby was born July 21, 1894, and from that time I had a bad uterine trouble, the pressure on the
bladder causing a desire to urinate every few minutes. Passing the urine gave me so much pain that at times' I would scream,
and the burning sensation was terrible. An intense burning and itching in the rectum was intolerable.
When the baby was six months old I was in a terrible condition. I treated with physicians in vain. I had night sweats so
badly the nig t clothe* and bedding had to be dried. ..,;.'
I had heard of VIAVI and sent for one of the ladies in charge of the office to come and see me &nd I began treatment In -
about ten days the sweat assumed a yellow appearance. The yellow matter seemed to c me from every pore in my body; sheets
pillowslips and night clothes looked as if they had been dipped in saffron. My head all around the roots of my .hair looked as if
insect powder had been sifted over it. .
I nursed my baby. He became sick and vomited as soon as he had nursed. What he threw, up was yellow. I was very
much lightened and sent for the lady who had s >ld me the treatment. She came and said I must wean the baby at once. I did
so and he was soon well. The yellow matter continued passing for several days. Then I began to get better, my bladder trouble i
was relieve i. I could walk and work, and at the end of a three months' course felt well and strong. I am going to tatce another
course to make my cure permanent, as I know it will cure those who are faithful. i

j enormous tension, then a volcano would
act as a safety vent, and so diminish the
tendency to earthqnake upheaval. Such,
I however, is not the observed fact: volcanic
vents are no safeguards against earth
quakes.
Observations under extremely limited
range of vertical depth exhibit an increase
of temperature of about one degree cen
tigrade for each 100 feet of depth from
the surface. It is not adifficult matter for
the readers of The Call to figure out the
depth at which all matter is in a molten
condition under the influence of the enor
mous heat. When by means of fissures in
the crust the water of the sea finds its way
to the hot interior steam a tremendous
pressure is formed and a displacement oc
curs, manifested as an earthquake. The
presence of carbonates, chlorides and sul
phates, etc., in the crust, would also tend
to produce disruptive gases. We are apt
to regard the crust of the earth as a rigid
affair. It is not so. "The solid earth" is
more poetical than real. During an earth
quake the earth's crust bends in a multi
tude of directions and the motion is prop
agated with a velocity of from 500 to 1000
feet per second.
Volcanoes have always been regarded
with awe by the unlearned, and that means
the majority of the people. There are 350
great volcanoes on the globe ; including ex
tinct ones, ancient and modern, over 1000.
There are tens of thousands of smaller
ones and millions of geysers, hot springs,
mud ejectors, etc. Yet the volcano is
simply the chimney, vomiting its fire and
smoke. The earthquake is the explosion
of the boiler.
Between the orbits of the planets Mars
and Jupiter are a vast number of tiny
planets, known as the asteroids. Astro

asteroids are the remains of a huge planet

by an internal explosion. That must have
been a mighty earthquake !
There is a ureat cosmic power which we
call "gravitation." Volcanoes and earth
quakes are but local manifestations of this
great power, of the essential nature of
which we know absolutely nothing. The
rifts and scars on the earth's surface are
its evidence, terrible yet indispensable to
the life of our globe.
It will be interesting to look over the
records of earthquakes and learn what re
gions are most likely to be affected and
whether there is any probability of a re
currence of the phenomenon.
During the eleven years ended in 1883
there were ' 364 earthquakes recorded as
occurring in the United States, of which
number 147 toot place on the Atlantic
Slope and the balance in the Western
States and the Pacific Slope. In 1885 42
occurred on the Pacific Slope and 17 on the
Atlantic. During the 250 years ended in
1879 out of 273 earthquakes in the United
States but 42 were recorded as occurring on
the Pacific Slope. These figures would
seem to indicate that the seat of disturb
ance was moving toward the Pacific.
The cause or causes of earthquakes re
main a mystery. The past training of
our scientific minds has been such as to
lead them to look to the earth itself for the
cause of every terrestrial phenomenon. Re
cently some modification of this narrow
view as obtained, and to-day the student
is not laughed at if he looks elsewhere for
the producing cause. It is fast becoming a
belief that celestial influence has much to
do with earthquakes. The phenomenon is
more frequent at new moon and full
moon than at the time of quarter moon.
More frequent when the moon is nearest
to the earth than when she is farthest off.
More frequent when the moon is on merid
ian than when she is at the horizon. More
frequent at the equinoxes, and especially
so at the autumnal equinoxes. The idea
that earthquakes had a periodicity depend
ent upon the position of the heavenly
bodied dates back as far as the records of
Babylon extend. An old Japanese book,
called "Jishin Setsu," asserts the same.

before I perceived any change for the better, but I persevered, and am now using the twelfth month's treatment. lam glad I did

feel benefited for some time. Yours truly, MISS L. B.

twelve years, one commencing in 1759, the
other in 1756. Also two other groups,
with twenty-eight - year periods, com
mencing respectively in 1756 and 1773.
These groups coincide with the times
when the giant planets, Jupiter and
Saturn, reach the mean longitudes of 135
degrees and 265 degrees.
The critical researches of Dr. E. Nau
man show a coincidence to exist between
the occurrence of the large earthquakes of
Japan and the thirty-three year period of
meteoric showers. The great ilumbol It
asserts the coincidence of the great earth
quake of Quito and Riobambo with a great
shower of meteors on February 4, 1797.
Of course these are but "coincidences,"
but what makes the coincidence? The
word "coincidence" does not dispose of
the facts, but it merely refers them all to
the same cause.
There are five earthquakes at night to
one during the day.
The conclusion that the particular posi
tion of the heavenly bodies may operate to
create terestial disturbances is, therefore,
no forced one ; and while old school geolo
gists may cling to the dogma that earth
quakes are solely due to the shrinking of
the earth's crust, it is certainly most re
markable that this shrinking should per
sistently manifest itself at regular periods
corresponding with the position and move
ments of the heavenly bodies! Scarcely
a day passes that there Is not some slight
shork in some portion of the globe. Not
of a degree approaching severity, but of a
faint character. It is a simple matter to
prove this. I give a cut and description
of a seismograph, or "earthquake re
corder," wjiich is exceedingly simple to
make and will correctly record the occur
rence of all shocks and tremors. It is a
heavy ball of metal suspended by a rod
and string; the lower end of the rod, which
projects below the ball, has a couple of
small shoulders provided with a vertical
hole, in which i; placed a needle free to
move up and down in the holes. The end
of the needle rests upon a piece of smoked
glass. The instrument must be placed
where all vibration of the ground from
passing vehicles in the street is absent.

IT WILL NEVER SINK
J\ Rough-Water Lifeboat With Air-Tight Com
partments Fed by Self-/lcting Tubes.
As Safe as Thougk Sealed
in a Barrel
It often happens that when a vessel
founders at sea and the people aboard of
her attempt to escape in the ordinary open
boats they will be capsized and drowned.
To prevent this Robert D. Mayo of Frank
fort, Mich., has invented a lifeboat that is
non-sinkable as a buoy and which can
not be filled with water. In the practica
ble application of the lifeboat the people
who have left the sinking ship are situ
ated the same as if they were sealed up in
a floating barrel.
To accomplish this result many things
had to be considered, chiefly the air sup
ply and the stability of the vessel, so tnat
it would be sell-righting.
The Mayo boat is made of metal and has
air-tight compartments that will keep it
afloat even though water should get into
the other part of it. These compartments
occupy both ends of the craft, and a few
feet back of the bulkhead that forms
either of them is another bulkhead that
communicates with the interior of the
lifeboat by a valve close up to the under
side of the deck.
The lifeboat is built to stand high out
of smooth water. Above this water line
there are a series of air pipes tnat enter
the space between the two bulkheads and
allow the atmosphere to freely enter and
pass into the inner compartment through
the vaive. This valve is of the automatic
pattern, so that when the water rises
around the boat and fills the space be
tween the bulkheads to a dangerous height
it closes naturally and keeps the water
from getting inside.
The motive power of this vessel is no
part of the invention, as it can be fitted
with any of the numerous contrivances
for that purpose now on the market.
In case of the abandoning of a ship at
sea the crew and passengers are loaded
into one of thÂ°se boats through an open
ing in the top, which is then closed and
fastened on the inside. The lifeboat is
then lowered in the usual manner and
turned loose. In case the boat is the last
one to leave the ship there are holes for
ropes to pass through, so that it can be
accomplished by the men on the inside.
There is a pump aboard that is capable of
ejecting any water that may come aboard.
When the Mayo lifeboat is in the water
and free of the ship all the inmates have
to do is to make themselves as comforta
ble as the circumstances will permit.
There is no possible danger of their getting
wet, Â»s thÂ» waves can wash over the vessel
without causing any great inconvenience.
Even if it should stay under water for a
minute the people would suffer no danger
for want of air, as there is enough in the
vessel to last several times that long. As
soon as the vessel comes to the top again
the water between the bulkheads runs
out and allows the air valve to
open so that there is a fresh
supply of air in an instant. Snch a vessel
could be adrift in a gale for days and the
people inside of her be in perfect comfort
and safety. As soon as the sea goes down
the top can be opened and the shipwrecked
mariners be in the same condition as if
they were in an ordinary ship's boat.
AÂ» well as making a good lifeboat there
is* no reason why the Mayo boat would not
be a success for long ocean voyages by
small parties. Equipped with a gasoline
engine and sails it could make good time,
and when very dangerous weather comes
up could be closed and allowed to drift
about until the gale had passed away.
To Extract Qold Without Water
The one great difficulty in the develop
ment of many gold field's in California and
elsewhere is the want of a sufficiently
great water supply with which to drive
the machinery necessary for extracting
gold from the ore or to utilize in operating
rich placer deposits. In t c southern part
of the State and in Arizona many dis
coveries of rich gold deDosits have had to
be abandoned on account of the lack of
water, and many inventors with more or
less success have exercised their in
genuity in trying to discover processes by
which water could be dispensed with in
extracting gold. A device invented by a
California mechanic, who is also au ex
perienced miner, has been tested on a
small scale wHh great success, and a full
sized model of which is now being con
structed by the Union Iron Worts.
The main feature of the invention is an
iron pipe of large dimensions, which is
bent into a spiral, forming a worm, eacu
convolution of which holds a charge of
quicksilver, not large enough, however, to
close the passage. The ore, previously re
duced to powder as fine as possible, is
drawn by a current of air through the
rapidly revolving pipe; the quicksilver by
this means is forced into a spray, which
takes hold of and forms an amalgam with
all particles of gold in the neighborhood.
In tests at recent trials with ore-bearing
sands from placers nearly every particle
of gold was recovered. Tests made with
the black sands from the seashore con
taining gold were very successful.
Photographing the Evje.
At a recent meeting of the Paris Acad

he had successfully photographed the
interior of the eye. Ihe advantages oi
thie method are important, since it ena

THE AUTUMN FASHIONS
Numerous will be the autumn brides, !
and already they have ordered some very
delightful gowns. One I have heard about j
is quite exquisite. It is a bridal dress of
rich, white satin. The corsage is draped
softly with white silk chiffon, which is j
to be caught up on the shoulders with i
sprays of orange blossoms. It droop 3 !
over the top of the crinkled, tight-fitting â¢
chiffon sleeve in a double puff. The top
of the bodice and a shaped panel in
the skirt are beautifully embroidered in
tiaj seed pearls. Sprays of orange bios- j
soms are to be arrayed at each end and in
the center of the embroidery. Equally j
interesting are other frocks in this trous- '
scan, which are far enough advanced for i
me to give you some idea of their novel
â¢ features. A Bmart little gray cheviot
serge has a loose-fronted bodice with an
unusually handsome yoke of cut jet, down (
the front of which are three jet buttons, j
Another sensible frock has a well-bung \
Bkirt, absolutely plain, of moderate width, j
The jaunty open-fronted coat has a roll
collar and fanciful small revers. The cor- j
ners are rounded and there are two pock- i
ets. Homespun is the material employed
in a shade of chocolate-brown.
A reception toilet of pink and gray shot j
Bilk had a folded cincture extending high |
under the arms; it is pointed in front j
and bordered along the top with lovely I
silver passementerie, as is also the top edge
of the corsage, which has a yoke and col
lar of pale gray creDe de chine over rose J
pink satin. With it is to be worn a cape j
of pale pink satin, covered with the finest I
embroidered black chiffon; the frills are j
of white chiffon.
Many of the creations of this bride's i
bright modiste for evening wear are quite j
charmingâ for instance, one is of pale
preen satin, run with a thread of gold.
The bodice has the appearance of being j
swathed round the pretty wearer (who is,
of course, a slender maiden), in folds;
across the decolletage is a broad piece of
creamy lace; over one shoulder are carried
soft folds of golden-hued tulle; over the
other extend some half-opened Marechal
Niel buds. The sleeves consist of many
frills of the tulle sewed over the green
latin. The skirt is without adornment,
but is completed inside with pinked frills
of golden-colored taffeta.
A dinner gown of turquoise blue silk has
& pointed belt of embroidery done in sil
ver, jet and emerald green sequins. A
narrow strip of the same outlines the
corselet at the top and waist and forms
braces over the shoulders. The chemi
sette and sleeves are of black net, on
â which appear the same sequins with good
effect. These also outline every seam of
the skirt.
For bridesmaids' dresses yellow and
pinK promise to be the most popular, as
they have been discovered to give an ea-
pecially pretty setting for the bride's |
gown. Peau de soie is to be a favorite I
fabric, and changeable taffetas in beauti- j
ful combinations rank among the latest
novelties, and mousseline de soie will con
tinue to be as much the vogue as ever be- I
fore for trimming. No bridesmaid ever i
thinks of wearing a waist that is not of i
the same material as her skirt, as from an
artistic point of view such a combination
could not be thought of. The skirts for
bridesmaids are to be a trine longer than
taose of last autumn and are narrower, |
.but are cut so as to have a certain flare.
Large hats with ostrich plumes are much
liked, still they match the dress in color.
' Many ladies strive after picturesque j
effects with the happiest results. Shortly
Bix pretty maids will walk up a certain
aisle, and all of them will be attired in !
pink, bnt not all will bo of the same shade, j
Instead three shades will be allowed which !
perfectly blend. Peau de soie will be j
used and charming little boleros of lace
will be worn, through which will De run
threads of gold. The pokelike bonnets j
are to be of cream-white straw, over which
pink roses and a cluster of short ostrich
plumes are to nod. Each maid will carry
a long cane (also cream white) in line, to
the top of which, with long pink ribbons,
will be tied a great bunch of pink roses.
The gloves worn will be of glace kid. As
Princess Maud had a full ruche of mous
seline de soie round the skirt of her wed
ding gown most of the brides, as well as
the maids, in the near future will have
their skirts adorned in a similar manner.
Speaking of brides reminds me that
any of them owning a carriage and having
a long visiting list, would find acceptable
a novel wedding present, just designed;
it is a small white leather "carriage bag,"
trimmed with gilt and lined with white
moire. It contains in the pockets a card
case and purse to matcb, smelling salts, a
gold pencil and a tiny watch set in the
outside. Bicycle bags are also much liked |
by wheelwomen. I will shortly have any
amount of news concerning the creations |
being designed for another belle, but great j
will be the changes announced within the
next sixty days in all our apparel; how
ever, the fiat has gone forth concerning j
our skirts and sleeves, and numerous are j
the dresses already to be seen which carry j
out the very latest of fashion's decrees, j
and already the large puffy sleeves are be- ;
ginning to look old-fashioned and their
adherents rather decidedly passe. Le roi
est mort, vive le roi.
If any of my readers must have gowns
for petite tenue, the most satisfactory are
the white grenadines. An authority says :
! They never seem to get out of order, but
i staud all weather and no end of wear and tear,
! looking smart to the last. I have litced one

| high toward the collar-band, are two small
i white satin revers, covered with guipure and
] embroidered in fine green pailletes. A little
i below, from each side pleat, another revers of
the same size and finish is spread out, giving
an exceedingly pleasing effect to the figure.
The bodice is belted with a green and white
, striped ribbon, plisse into fans over the hips.
' A green velvet collar-band, with pointed g-ui
l pure ruS, was very becoming. The sleeves,
simple modern gigots fitting the lower arm,
; had lace mils at the wrist. Such a pretty hat
| of white satin straw was worn, the crown
i rather high and covered almost entirely with
â  two shades of green tulle. Perched on the top
j of the tulle was a single American Beauty rose
j with foliage.
At a reception given here two weeks ago
a gown of apricot taffeta shot with white
was worn by an Eastern bride. The most
beautiful jeweled insertion was intro
duced in the skirt within two feet of the
bottom. It was about four inches in
width and looked as though composed of
diamonds, emeralds and golden threads.
A sort ef little bolero was made of the
same, and the entire gown had a lining of
white glace with frills of the apricot silk.
Shot apricot silk is in high favor, as it is
undoubtedly extremely becoming to
many. As a result of this discovery one of
the prettiest girls I have ever seen was a
picture last week in a sheer organdie frock
richly incrusted with real Valenciennes
lace made over an apricot taffeta, also
shot with white. She wore a wide sash of
taffeta ribbon exactly matching the silk
slip. It was tied in two donkey ear loops
and the long ends reached the bottom
of the skirt, and were deeply fringed.
Her simple hat of white leghorn was
simply trimmed with tulle, which matched
her sash, ana three short but very choice
ostrich feather?. This lovely toilet was
worn at a country luncheon, on which
occasion was almost equally admired a
creation of most exquisitely fine em
broidered grass linen over a slip of Nile
green silk. A long sash of plain grass
linen encircled a pretty waist. This sash
was trimmed on the outer edge with lace;
it measured between sixteen and eighteen
inches at the ends, but tapered off to half
that width at the waist line. The chic
bolero was completely covered with
puckered Valenciennes, front rounding
and back cut up in a point. The epau
lettes were also of puckered lace, laid in
jabot folds over the slightly bouffant

sleeves, which fitted the arms closely and
were finished with the puckered lace. A
choter, having the plain linen as a founda
tion, was completely covered with lace.
The Geisha parasol is in high favor. It
is of pagoda form, the ribs being flattened
out at the edges, so as to advantageously
show a lining of bouillonne chiffon or, soft
! silk, finished in many cases with a flounce
|of fine old lace. The covering is of plain
! or chine silk, without any trimming, all
; elaboration being reserved for the lining,
which is usually of a contrasting shade.
One much admired was covered with white
corded silk and has a lining of the latest
azure-blue chiffon, and another of a chine
silk covered with large sprays of pink roses
scattered over a white ground has a rose
pink chiffon lining. One of the advantages
of this shape is that when shut the flat
tened edges of the ribs turn back suffi
ciently to show flowerlike glimpses of the
lining. The makers have used with much
success handles of colored mother-of-pjtarl
tinted pink, blue or a beautiful delicate
shade of mauve. Of course the handle is
chosen so as to harmonize with the cover
ing, and Dresden handles of unusually
lovely designs are still employed.
A Paris correspondent writes: "Spun
glass sunshades are the latest novelty
here. Many of my readers may hear of
th!s with some amusement,' as spun glass
does not seem to represent a material
from which any kind of an umbrella may
be manufactured. Such is, however, the
case, and very pretty if rather perishable
they are, these glistening creations, so
light and airy and original. How the
glass is spun for the purpose it is not for
me to say, but it is treated in such a
fashion that it can be folded without
I breaking, as, for the' matter of that, it is
i woven loosely it is true, but still woven,
in the same manner as canvas, with bier
meshes, and is to be obtained in pale tints
of extreme shininess, which seem to have
imprisoned thousands of sunrays betwixt
their tiny, silky threads."
And in Newport so gay are the parasols
that they can only be compared to "eigan
tic flowers." Another noted at Newport
of corded white silk had a rich flounce of
Maltese lace, a dainty heading of white
gauze and a lovely ivory stick and handle
mounted in embossed gold, the graceful
design run halt way up. It had a gilt
frame tipped with points of dead gold.
If you can find a remnant of green and
blue shot silk that will harmonize well
with your cloth secure it promptly, as this
combination is likely to continue to be the
fashion all winter. The blue I refer to is
the rich royal blue, and the green is grass
green. To return to my subject. The tailor
gown having been secured, the matron,
belle and debutante who can afford a

start on an interesting tour of inspection,
but exactly what they will see I cannot
yet say, as the goods are slowly arriving,

during the season of sales, have
secured rich and lovely materials
that will excite the envy and admiration

much diligent search. Little compara

THE T AN SHOE MUST SO
The latest novelty in watches for men
are those reproduced in gold from the
French empire period. They bid fair to
become popular, being very small and so
flat that they lie in the waistcoat pocket
unperceived. Some men have been seen
wearing as scarfpins heads of hounds and
terriers in brilliants. However, such de
signs are very ordinary.
At the present moment there is quite a
craze for crash for country wear, although
the smartest men adhere to their flannels
and some to linens. "Him" remarks: "I am
not so averse to linen clothes^ in the 'alto
gether,' but I leave the white duck
trousers to the schoolboy and the subur
banite. The russet or brown leather boot
is doomed."
The straw hat is popular in England,
and I ccc a wild statement that every one
will wear that abomination known as the
Alpine straw hat because the Duke of
York has been seen with one. The foliy
of either the Prince of Wales or the Duke
of York leading the men's fashions is ex
ploded. The Prince dresses quite well for
a man of his age, but who ever knew of a
sailor who knew how to dress? The
CLIMBING OUT TAMALPAIS
People who live in Mill Velley say that
more women have climbed to the top of
Mount Tamalpais this year than all those
put together who have made the ascent in
the last five years. In fact It has become
quite popular for ladies to climb the
beautiful peak on the north shore of San
Francisco Bay, and often a dozen par
ties can be seen winding up the trail in
order to get the grand view from the top
and also to get the benefit of the fresh air
and exercise incidental to the trip.
Why has the trip suddenly become so
popular? some might ask. The answer is
plain enough to any one who will tasethe
trouble to even glance at the ladies who
have reached the top. They wear bloom
ers. Without bloomers they might have
accomplished the ascent, but it would
have been such hard work. In fact it is
the hard work incidental to skirts that
has kept women from making the ascent
in the past.
Strong, indeed, must the woman be who
can on a hot day climb to the top of
Tamalpais while wearing a skirt, to say
nothing of the discomfort of the dust and
heat of the garments. They are so heavy
to carry and make the use of an alpen
stock almost impossible, which is really
dangerous because few women are athletic
enough to get over the rough and uncer
tain trail without some support.
But with bloomers on, how different it
is. A woman can get over the ground
with an ease sbe has never known before
and reach the top of the mountain as soon
as most men, except, of course, those men
who are trained to the sport. There is no
exercise equal to a climb to the top of
Tamaipais. It is not a fatiguing trip and
is really healthful because the top of the
mountain is not too high above the sea
level for the atmosphere to be rarefied.
Many women feel a certain modesty
about "wearing bloomers on the public
streets, even when riding a bicycle. But
they need not feel that way about wearing
bloomers to the top of Tamalpais. A
woman without bloomers on the trail is
an unusual sight. And, indeed, when one
sees a party it is the skirt that seems out
of place. There are no hoodlums on the
trail to pass unpleasant remarks, and the
men that one doea meet do not seem to
even see one's garments. Xhey are nearly
bodices, unless we possess some real lace
flounces, for in that case they can be
utilized to great advantage, as you see in
the models presented this week. It is well
to have not more than three or
four evening dresses made during Oc
tober, for numerous little fads and
caprices will obtain during December.
But a few words concerning the passing
season at the present moment: "Muslins,
and that of the sheerest, gauzes, crepes,
rilk canvases, 'veilings,' lace over thin
glace silks, painted etamine, embroidered
tulles, are the order of the day, adorned
with flounces upon flounces of lace, and
with ribbons galore, in tints so soft, so
flower-like, and so brilliant withal that one
ends dv resembling some of those bonbon
bags which our great tontisenrs have the
secret to make so perfectly beautiful."
Duke of Clarence was always well groomed
and well turned out. The Dnko of York
impresses me as being a bit slovenly. He
is a very good young man in his way, but
one who possesses no personal magnetism
whatever. But to return to the Alpine
straw. It is stiff and unbecoming, and it
gives a man an opera bduffe appearance
that is ridiculous.
The English are trying hard to make
the morning coatâ a species of cutaway â
fashionable. This also will hardly be
popular here, as the design is too stiff and
the lounge or sack coat is so much more
complete.
Alter all, in dressing well one should
avoid what is common. As soon as the
masses are arrayed in a fashion then avoid
it. Few if any women look otherwise-than
common and dowdy in what are known as
"shirt-waists," and very few men can
envy the mass of color which is presented
to them in the haberdasher-shop Â«nn- ,
dows.
As 1 previously stated, gray is to be the
color this autumn and black four-in-hands,
black ties and the narrow black silk bow
for semi-formal evening dress will be in
all scientists, artists or just plain lovers of
nature, and men from any of these classes
are never known to be rude to a woman.
If ycu meet a man on the trail he will,
most likely, raise his hat when he allows
you to pass, but make no further effort to
begin a conversation than some remark
about the pleasant weather.
Dozens of ladies from San Franciico
make the ascent to the top of Tamalpais
in bloomers and enjoy it, as is shown by
the lact that they are sure to repeat the
experience. When they leave the City
these women wear an ordinary street
skirt over their bloomers and when they
are well out of the crowd in Mill Valley,
remove it and either carry it with them
or leave it in one of the nearby stores,
where the people are only too glad to
take care of it until the owner returns.
Under these circumstances the bloomers
can be made of very thin material. Many
ladies who frequently go to the peak
make their bloomers of coarse, black
alpaca, which is easy to clean, and also
cool and dust-shedding.
The Mill Valley trail to the top of Ta
malpais is the more interesting, although
the Ross Valley trail is said to be the eas
ier walking. In the former the grandeur
of the view begins as soon as the top of
tne hiil back of the station is climbed and
increases in beauty until the top is
reached. The Ross Valley trail for sev
eral miles lies }n behind the surrounding
hills, and as a consequence there is no
view to speak of, except between clumps of
trees, until more than half of the distance
is covered. As this trail is of an easy
grade it does not offer the chances of
vigorous exercise the other does, because
one Is apt to get tired of walking long be
fore any climbing commences.
The view from Tamalpais is enough to
repay any woman for the climb to the
summit, providing she wears bloomers.
In that case she will not be worn out and
can enjoy the wonderful expanse of coun
try spread out beneath her. something she
is not likely to do if she wears skirts. The
new railroad to the top will likely mate
the trip an easy one, but those who make
it that way will never get the enjoyment
out of it that the women do who put on
bloomers ana climb.
Fashion continues to expect her follow
ers to have small waists, bat the
pinched-in, wasp-like waist is regarded as
thoroughly out of date. However, a *ood
corset-maker never makes a corset which
gives an abnormal appearance, but alas,
the woman who thoroughly understands
the needs of her customers is even harder
to find than the capable dressmaker, for
no woman should allow her figure to be
crushed by a stiff, unyielding sort of affair
which will give her an artificial appear
ance. I recently heard of a prominent so
cial leader being troubled with a most un
becoming and unfashionable amounts of
color, who decided to consult her physi
cian on the subject. His prescription
was brief, "Let out your corset four
inches." The social autocrat was indig
nant. Maecklla.
vogue. Men are out of date who appear
in white silk evening ties, as lawn is the
thing to wear. C. 0.

STAGE
After seeing "A Social Trust" one won
ders whether Ramsay Morris and Hillary
Bell put tbeir neads together and decided
to write a purpose drama, without saying
anything to the advance agent about the
moral which adorns their tale. Anyway,
whether it was their intention or not, they
have succeeded in writing a pitiful com
mentary on the decline and fall of repub
lican simplicity. Talk about effete aristoc
racies! Why in Spain or Russia people
could not barter and sell themselves more
for "social position" than "A Social
Trust" makes men and women do in New
York. A contemptible, parvenu social
' ambition they show too, with no dignity
of "noblesse oblige" to redeem it.
â¢ The chief character, Brewster, looks
upon his social position as a huckster
looks upon his wares â something that will
help him to rake in more shekels. He
buys a wife with a dowry of a quarter of
a million by promising to launch" her
â family in the European swim and when
the money is his he breaks his word and
snubs and insults his wife and her family
like a cur. Brewster also makes use of
his precious "social position" to dispose
of watered stock among his friends of the
Four Hundred and Daniel Hellock, his
associate in fraud, has the men of New
York society sc deep in his web that at his
command they tremblingly force their
â¢ wives to attend the notorious Mrs. Hel
lock's ball. If the state of society por
trayed in the drama is true to life, another
clause should be added to the litany:
"From New York social position, good
Lord deliver us."
The curtain falls on good situations all
through "A Social Trust," and the last act
is strongly dramatic. The worst of these
situations is that they are too palpably
prepared beforehand. What moveÂ« Cnar
teris King, for instance, to fling his
arms madly, passionately around Mrs.
Brewster's neck and vow that he loves
her? It is not that he has received any
encouragement from the lady or that the
spot is opportune. The reason he commits
himself so violently is evidently because
his doing so will make a good situation,
lor in the nick of time the revengeful hus
band glowers in at the window.
The burden of the acting falls on Wilton
Lackaye and Mrs. Thorndyke Boucicault
The one-time Svengali shines as Brewster,
but Mrs. Boucicault was not cut out by
nature for emotional roles, and she makes
a mistake in attempting them. The pain
ful way in which ncr pretty, fragile little
voice breaks in the heavy scenes should
show her that Darts like Mrs. Brewster
are not for her.
In exclamations the authors of "A
Social Trust" have shown a woful want of
imagination. They have one stock phrase,
"Oh! God," which, is used under every
stress of feeling by all the emotional char
acters in the play.
English says he wishes he had never
written "Ben Boit," and most of us are
now ready to say a fervid "Amen, so be
it." Ben was all very well in his place,
in fact, we cherished quite a liking for
him, though we knew he must have a
stern and morose character, or else why
did Sweet Alice tremble with fear at his
frown? In his days of modesty we were
ready to overlook this, but when Dv
Maurier trotted him out of his sphere and
gave him as much advertising as if he had
been a new pill or an improved bicycle,
Ben became a nuisance. No household
was complete without " Ben Bolt,"
and not only did he haunt the
home, he was Ã¼biquitous abroad.
"Ben Bolt" was sung everywhere, except
in the sanctuary; transcriptions of "Ben
Bolt" were spanked out of lone-suffering
pianos, hand-organs dinned him into our
reluctant ears, and bands got hold of
him and served him up in as many dif
ferent styles as there are of serv
ing up oysters, "Ben Bolt au naturel";
"moderaio, con espressione," "capric
cioso assai," "arrabbiato, con fuoco."
etc.. till "Ben Bolt" became something
to flee from, and sensitive musicians were
glad to take their summer vacations in
mountain fastnesses or on the briny
main, to escape from the eternal "Oh,
don't you remember sweet Alice?"
And now, just as people are returning
to town and taking up again the cares and
burdens of life, buoyed up by the faith
that "Ben Bolt" has died a natural death
and that life has one nightmare less, who
should again resurrect the gentleman who
has been so frequently admonished to re
member sweet Alice but the Orpheum! Syd
ney H. de Gray is the culprit who has
been warbling "Ben Bolt," and Mildred,
his wife, has aided and abetted him by im
personating Trilby. Sydney is a pleasing
vocalist, as theater-goers who heard him
with the "Blue Jeans" company at the
California will remember, but he should
bear in mind that the Trilby craze has
died out and that "Ben Bolt" has per
ished with it.
Of all barbarous and ridiculous freaks
indulged in by theater-goers who pre
sumably love the drama not wisely but
too well, is the freak of giving recalls in
the middle of a scene. AH the illusion is
gone when the actors, as the climax to a
harrowing and tearful dialogue, suddenly
trip to the footlights smiling and bowing
in response to a noisy recall. In "La Tra
viata at the Tivoli last weefc the most
touchingly acted scene in the opera was
regularly broken into by the recall fiend,
who insisted on having Germont back
after he had bidden adieu to the weeping
Violetta. After the recall tne lady buried
her face in her handkerchief again, with
a pretense at grief which the recall fiend
had made as ridiculous as it was before
touching.
BALDWIN THEATER.
"Madame Sans Gene" will receive its
first San Francisco production to-morrow
night at trie Baldwin Theater. The pres
ent version is to be in English.
The play is in three acts and a prologue.
Aside from Napoleon, the chief figure is a
laundry girl named Catherine Hubscher,
who about the time of the fall of the Bas
tile marries Sergeant Lefebvre, a man who
afterward becomes one of Napoleon's
Marshals and a Duke of the First Empire.
At the parvenu court of Napoleon the
ex- washerwoman's free and easy manners
win her the nickname of Mme. Sans Gene,
and so shocked is the Emperor at her lacK
of ceremony that he commands Lefebvre
to divorce his wife and take a woman of
noble family. The poor Duke is in
despair, but Catherine, rising to the occa
sion, has a personal interview with
Napoleon, in which she reminds nim that
she did his washing in the days when he
was only Captain Bonaparte of the artil
lery, and that he did not always settle his
accounts; in fact she shows nim an un
paid bill. The Emperor is so touched by
this allusion to his early struggles that
he tells Lefebvre that he may keep his
wife.
The rest of the plot deals with an alleged
intrigue between Napoleon's second wife.
Marie Louise, and a youne Austrian
officer.
Elaborate staging is promised. The
company includes Augustus Cook as
NaDoleon and Kathryn Kidder as Mme.
Sans Gene.

drama, in which Steve Brodie is said to
have made a hit in the East, will be played
at the California Theater to-morrow week.
TIVOLI OPERA-HOUSE.
Verdi's ever popular opera "Ernani,"
with Signor Michelena in the title-role,
will be given to-morrow night at the
Tivoli. John J. Raffael will take the im
portant part of Charles V. Signor Abram
hoff will be Don Silva, the grandee of
Spain, and Mme. rfataii will appear as
Elvira, his niece and betrothed. "Ernani"
will also be given on Wednesday, Friday
and Sunday evenings.
"Rigoietfo," by special request, will be
sung on Tuesday, Thursday a nd Saturday
evenings, as there is a general desire to
hear Signor de Vries again in his fine im
personation of the title role. Mme. Xjna
Bertini Humphreys will appear as Gilda.
The remainder of the cast will remain the
same as on the former occasion, except
that Miss Bernice H olmes will sing the
role of Magdalena.
For the tenth week of the season a
special presentation of Verdi's "IlÃallo in
Maschera" ("The Masked Ball") will be
given, with a cast inciuding three prima j
donnas. Miss Ida Valerga will mane her
first appearance this season in this pro
duction. "Aida" and the first local pro
duction of the famous fairy opera "Hansel
and Gretel 1 ' will follow.
COLUMBIA THEATER.
It has been decided to continua "The
Social Trust" at the Columbia Theater for
another week. The play is* drawing large
houses, and is already counted among the
Frawiey Company's successes.
Following "The Social Trust" at the
Columbia will come De Mille and Belas
co's New York Lyceum Theater success,
"The Wife." which will be produced here
for the first time.
"The Matrimonial Maze," a comedy
drama by Walter Craven, will shortly re
ceive its first production at the Columbia
Theater.
GRAND OPERA-HOUSE.
Henry Sedley has been especially en
gaged to appear this week in "Held in
Slavery" at the Grand. He will appear in
his original character of Julian. Lottie
Williams and Edwin J. Heron, the two
new comedy performers, will have good
parts in "Held in Slavery," and Julia
Blanc is to play an old colored lady, with
songs and dances. A feature of the pro
duction willifoe the appearance of twenty
piccaninies.
"Held in Slavery" is a nautical melo
drama, with some sensational effects, in
cluding a real rainstorm, a fire and a fierce
knifefight.
These incidents are held together by a
story of love and villainy. There are also
many funny scenes, which will enable
Miss Williams and E. J. Heron to do sev
eral specialty turns.
ALCAZAR THEATER.
The Alcazar Theater opens under its
new management to-morrow night with
"Turned Up," which will be presented by
a comedy company consisting of: The
Misses Adele Belgarde, Amy Lee, May
Buckley, Hattie Foley, Rosella La Fai'le,
Violet Aubrey, Mrs. F. M. Bates, Mrs.
Henry Vandenhoff, and Messrs. John T.
Sullivan, Frank Doane, Richardson Cot
ton, Gordon Foster, J. B. Polt, Carl
Smith, F. B. Clayton, Charles Bryant and
W. A. Belasco.
Tt is the intention of the managers â
Messrs. Belasco, Doane and Jordan â to
stage comedy, comedy-drama and scciety
drama. The interior of the house has
been thoroughly renovated and a system
of ventilation which is said to be very
effective has been Introduced.
AT THE ORPHEUM.
Filson and Erroll, a comedy team with
good recommendations from the East, will
appear at the Orpheum this week in a
sketch which they call "Men vs. Women,''
and which is said to afford opportunities
for emotional as well as comedy work.
The sketch is a satire on the prentensions
of society people, and the ambitious new
woman is treated rather sarcastically. The
Cosman couple, who will also appear, are
English specialty artists whom Gustav
Walter has brought over from Australia.
Their work is said to be very funny. Lydia
Yearaans Titus returns for one week only.
She will be assisted by Fred J. Titus, and
has some new songs to introduce.
Of last week's performers Richard Pitrot
will introduce local characters into his
impersonations, Albini will show new
card tricks and Nellie Maguire will ap
pear in new "coster" songs. This will be
the last week of Herr Techow's trained
cats, and the four Nelson sisters will close
their engagement next Sunday. Favor
and Sinclair remain.
The annex to the Orpheum, or Wein
stube, as Gustav Walter styles it, is now
open to the public.
AT THE CHUTES.
The Chutes attract as many people as
ever and the long shoot down into the
water, the greatest scenic railway on
earth, the trolley, haunted swing, funny
little black bears and numerous other
features around the Haight-street grounds
are fully appreciated by San Francisco
lovers of outdoor amusement.
The Casino offers an attractive pro
gramme at present. There are the De
Filippis, eccentric dancers, the Zanfar
ellas, aerial artists, the Lenore family,
juvenile instrumentalists, and Lewis
Lawrence, a young man who has a won
derful barytone voice.
Al half-past 4 this afternoon Emil
Markeberg, the nervy little aeronaut who
has had so many varied experiences with
his balloon lately, will mate an ascension
and parachute drop. When he reaches an
altitude of two or three thousand feet he
will liberate a pair of carrier pigeons
whose cote is in Alameda. They have
been turned loose before from an airship
by Markeberg and have always arrived
Home in about eight minutes.

NEW AUDITORIUM.
The "Death of Spiritualism" is the title
of a unique entertainment to be given at
the Auditorium to-night by T. 0. Alex
ander.
TWO RIVAL MIMICS.
The hatred between Biondi, who has
just completed an engagement at the Or
pheum, and Fregoli, the Italian mimic,
vocalist and ventriloquist, who has just
completed an engagement at Hammer
stein's Olympia, is said to be something
terrible. Fregoii'a dislike goes to the ex
tent of tracking Biondi around on his
travels and writing to the press to say that
Biondi has built himself up upon him, the
great Fregoli, as his model.
Fregoli's talent for mimicry was discov
ered in a rather singular way, according
to the Dramatic Times.
At the age of 20, while he was a clerk in
a railroad office in Milan, he was drawn
for the army and was sent to Massowah,
Abyssinia, under General Baldissera, and
at that place he began his theatrical ca
reer. He had possessed the power of
mimicry from childhoodj and in the army
he practiced it for'the amusement of him
self and his comrades. There was a thea
ter in Massowah, where entertainments
were given by traveling companies, chiefly
for the amusement of the officers and
soldiers. Soon after Fregoli's arrival a
company which had been giving farces
and operettas departed suddenly, the
members of the organization returning to
Italy.
An entertainment was to be given the
following night, at which there were to be
a number of the general's invited guests.
Tie general was considerably annoyed at
the prospect of having to disappoint his
friends, some of whom came a consider
able distance, and one of the men, think
ing to help him out of a dilemma, men
tioned Fregoli's name and bis ability as
an entertainer.
Fregoli was sent for and asked what he
could do toward giving a performance in
place of the departed company. The
young soldier's confidence pleised the
general and he was given the opportunity
to give a public exhibition of his powers
as a mimic.
For this entertainment he performed a
piece which had been presented by the
company during its stay, in which he im
itated the various members of the organi
zation. The performance lasted about
three h Jurs, and wa3 a great success. The
general was so pleased with Fregoli's
work that he relieved him from military
duty ana placed him in charge of the
theater, where he frequently appeared,
and for which he also irained a company
of amateurs. He continued at the theater
until the expiration oi his time of service
in the army, when despite the efforts made
by General Baldiisera to induce him to
stay, he returned to Rome, where in 1892
he made his professional debut at the
Exedra Music Hall.
SARAH BUYS A FORTRESS.
Mme. Sarah Bernhardt, says the Gentle
woman, "is installed for the summer at
Belle Isle. There she has bought a kind of
fortress, which dates from tne time of Flo
quet, superintendent of finance. The great
actress has not changed one stone of the
fortress, but she has decorated the interior
with antique furniture, brasses and bibe
lots. At the entrance she has placed two
immense ibises with outstretched winps.
These birds, dear to the Egjptians, are of
zinc and painted green. Tne actress is
the 'good fairy' of all the fisherfolk, and I
hear from a friend who has visited Belle
Isle that many English people come to
the place by the Quiberon boat merely to
have a glimpse of Sarah Bernhardt."
DRAMATIC BREVITIES.
Henry Irvine is to produce "Madame
Sans Gene" at the Lyceum Theater, Lon

staff ot twenty operators.
MIGAL O BEAT HIS WIFE.
A Warrant Now Out for His
Arrest on a Charge of
Battery.
The Woman Is in a Serious Condition
and a Murder Charge, May
Follow.
Vincent Onnuzzi swore to a complaint
in Judge Joachimsen's court yesterday,
charging his brother-in-law, Rafael Mi
galo, 10 Margaret place, with battery upon
his sister.
Mrs. Migalos has a baby 6 months old,
and is in poor health. She works m a
cannery, and on her way home Friday
evening bought a ioaf of bread. Migalo
was at home drinking with some compan
ions when she entered. Without any
provocation he grabbed the loaf of bread
from her and struck her in the face with
it. She staggered from the blow and Mi
galo followed it up by throwing her to the
floor and jumping on her. The other men
pulled him away, and when they saw that
the poor woman had fainted they sent for
a doctor and put her to bed.
The woman was in a precarious condi
tion yesterday and when her brother
heard of what her husband had done to
her he urged her to have him arrested.
She refused, saying she would forgive
him this time, but if he beat her again
she would take steps to have him pun
ished for it.
Onnuzzi, finding her obdurate, took the
matter into his own hands and swore to
the complaint charging Migalo with bat
tery. If the woman should die he will
have to answer to a charge of murder.
The Migalos live in two rooms in the
house on Margaret place, which is a small
street running north from Valle jo street,
between Kearny and Dupont. Mrs.
Migalo bears the name among her neigh
bors of being a hard-working, industrious,
young woman, but her husband is lazy
and addicted to drink.
Had < plum Aboard.
Twenty half-pound tins of opium , supposed to
be intended for Honolulu, was found on board
the steamer Australia yesterday. The drug
was concealed in the bunk of John Hansen,
who was sent for and notified that his services
â were no longer required. Hansen wag a fire
man on the steamer. The opium was stamped,
hence the Government officials were powerless
to take any action in the premises further
than to notify the steamship company of the
illegal cargo.

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 29-â Stocks were
more active to-day and prices were higher than on
any previous day of the week. . The change in sen
timent was due -to the general impression that
rjoaey will work easier next week on account of
the steady Influx of go d from Europe. Additional
engagements of 91,250,000 gold in London for
shipment to New. York were reported, The en
gagements now figure up between 913,000,000
aad $14 OCO.OOO, and, according to foreign bant-'
ers the $20,000,000 mark will be reached early
next week. The Dank statement proved less un
favorable than generally. expected, the loss in sur
plus reserve amounting to only. 5436,450, and
this ad -led to the bnUish feeling. .
, The bay was princija'.ly from the shorts, but
in the case of Western I nlon it was report'd on
the board that Inside Interests were tak.ng the
stock. The advance in prices raneed from y, to
Si-* per cent, thÂ» latter in Lackawanna. The an
thracites were strengthened by an unfouode-l re
port that J. P. Morgan A Co. had secured control
of the Cox -Bros.- coal '-property. - Manhattan,
v% esiern Union, the Granger and Internationals
were all In demand and touched the best figures of
the week. Illinois Steel dropped s V's Â°Â° forced i
liquidations brought about, accordi: to stock ex- !
change reports, by the failure of Moore Bros, of j
Chicago.

MEN WHO MAKE RUBBEY.
They Might Earn SI S a Day by Exert
ing Themselves.
Few people ever give a thought to how
much of our comfort nowadays depends
on a few lazy, sleepy South American na
tives along the Amazon River, says the
New York Journal. Half the mechanism
of our daily life would come to a stop were
there a rubber famine. The hundreds of
thousands of bicyclists, for instance, would
have to jolt along on rigid, springless
wheels, and a universal wail would arise
from millions of babies deprived of their
feeding bottles. \;
Tne men who make the rubber in the
jangles of Brazil can earn $15 a day when
they choose to work. They toil as little as
their necessities will permit," however, and
fortnat reason the supply of this article is
always far below the demand. ,: Many trees
in various parts of the world yield the
caoutchouc milk, but none in such quan
tities as in the seamy, luxuriant jungles
along the Amazon. :
There natives cut gashes in the bark and
place under the wound a little clay dish.
The milÂ£ which rnnsout, if examined un
der the microscope, is found to De sap, in
which are suspended millions of tiny glob
ules of liquid caoutchouc. In three days
the trees will bleed about six ounces. The
fluid is collected and . taken home, where
the native operator evaporates the surplus
moisture and reduces the caoutchouc to
tbe condition so familiar to raw india
rubber. ; ; "*'" â  â 
He has a wooden mold on the end of a
stick; and having dipped this in the milk,
: he dries it in a fire of s oily nuts, forming a
I thin, elastic film over the mold. He keeps
! on adding to this by repeated dippings
I and cooking over the lire until a solid cake
!of rubber. is f the \ result. An v expert will
make six or seven pounds an hour, but the
native will work at his leisure. Every sort
of food 'or commodity in these . districts
has to be imported and brings a -high
: price. Thither find their way, f virtually,'
most of. the gay-colored ties that changing
fashions leave upon the dealers' bands in
New York and London. Often a native
' will wear one of these, which will cost him
$4 or (5. and little other clothing. It seems
a charming and . idyllic sort of 1 existence.'
but no white man can withstand the
fevers, and so the lazy natives have a mo
nopoly of their trade. , â¢ .' . .

"LANKY BOB" MAY
MEET CHOYNSKI.
The National Club Offers a
$10,000 Purse for Such
a Contest.
MITCHELL ALSO BIDDING
George Green Angry at His
Treatment by the Na
tional Club.
STEIZNER â¢ PEPPERS COKTEST.
Joe McAuliffe Is Now Willing to
Meet Any Aluminum Weight
in America.
As an aftermath of the series or con
tests Friday night at Woodward's Pavilion
the air is full of fight talk. All sorts of
things are under discussion, but the main
matter of interest is the prospects of a
bout between Choynuki and "Lanky Bob"
Fitzsimmons.
J. J. Groom, representing the National
Club, to-day approached Choynski and
offered a $10,000 purse for a fight between
him and Fitzsimmons. Choynski states
,Â£hat he is perfectly willingâ nay, eagerâ
to meet Fitz, but that the National Club
has no permit for such a contest and
might experience considerable difficulty
â  in procuring it.
"I referred Groom to Greany," he said,
"who is looking out after my interests.
Saturday I shall leave for the East and
will box a limited number of rounds with
Keddy Gallagher in Denver September 8.
On the 9th of September I will box four
rounds with Billy Woods at Cripple Creek.
I hope the high altitude will be kinder to
. me than to my friend, Jim Corbett."
Cboynski here stopped to laugh at his
sally, and added that from Cripple Creek
he will co to New York, where he will be
willing to meet all comers.
Cboynski was so anxious to lay his
hands on the coin resulting from his vic
tory over McAuliffe that he kept one of
the directors up till 3 a. h. yeslerday
counting tickets and money. Snortly
â¢ fter 3 o'clock the man of the chrysanthe
mum locks took his coin in a satchel and
departed in peace.
McAuliffe did not show up to-day, but
got his coin through Barney Farley and
another representative.
It is now definitely learned that the
exact audience at the fight was 3800, of
which 3500 was paid attendance. Instead
of the men receiving 60 and 10 per cent of
the gross receipts, as heretofore published,
the money was Dy mutual agreement
divided evenly. This haÂ« been known all
along by a few. McAuliffe at first wanted
it divided in the ratio of 50 and 10, and
when Choynski objected to this and
wanted it divided evenly, McAuliffe tried
o compromise on 35 per cent to the win
ner and 25 to the loser. ChoynsKi, how
ever, held out for an even division, and
McAuliffe at length acquiesced.
The aggregate amount received by the
men was #2969 40. Each received half. If
Choynski haa acquiesend in his oppo
nent's first proposition he would have re
ceived about $2400 of this.
The hght between Peppers and Stelzner
will not take place at Woodward's Pavilion
owing to the fact that the Grove-street
Theater people refuse to release the Na
tional Club from its bond of rental. The
contest will take place at the Grove-
Btreet Theater September 2.
The National Club, however, is having
firm opposition from the new Occidental
Â« Club in securing the match between
Choynsxi and Fitzsimmous. "Young
Mitchell" has been actively negotiating
for some time in this matter, and states
that a letter should arrive Monday with
definite results, as he has received a tele
gram that such epistle is on its way here
now.
Colonel Hopkins, Dan Creedon's man
ager, has left tne whole matter of a match
in Mitchell's hands. The latter states
that he is confident Alex Greggains will
consent to meet Creedon.
George Green is complaining bitterly of
the treatment he received at the hands of
the National Club. He says he was as
sured Gallagher would be here to meet
him September 2, and has steadily kept at
his work of training for the event. Alter
the club learned that Gallagher would not
appear, Green thinks they should have
found him an opponent instead of substi
tuting a fight between Stelzner and Pep
pers.
O'FARHELL'S BUSINESS.
It Is Being Divided Vp Among the
Other Real Kstate Agents.
A meeting of the creditors of O'Farrell & Co.
has been called for to-morrow at 10 o'clock, at
which time it is stated that a proposition will
be submitted to purchase the business of the
late firm. In view of the fact that Baldwin &
Hammond have announced that they are pre
pared to make satisfactory settlements with all
for whom rents have been collected and not
paid over by O'Farrell & Co., it is not probable
that any agreement will be reached at the
meeting. A. S. Baldwin, in speaking of the
matter yesterday, said: "We are prepared to
make satisfactory propositions to all parties
whose business is worth handling. I am not
prepared to say that we would purchase all
of the accounts, for the reason that much of
the business has been handled for less than
any responsible firm can afford to do it. Such
of the Duslness, however, as is profitable we
desire to obtain, and I know that we can make
a satisfactory proposition to the individuals
separately, altnough I have no intention of
submitting an offer for the business collec
tively. A number of the accounts have been
transferred to other houses, and our firm has
already been the recipient of its proportion of
the business." *
Sued for Breach of Contract.
G. G. Wickson, a Front-street dealer in farm
ing implements and machinery, has sued the
Monarch Cycle Company for $5000 damages
for breech of contract and for an accounting
o! a commission business.
Eight months ago the cycle company rented
a portion of the store of Wickson and agreed
to pay $200 a month rent to there conduct its
agency. A commission of 10 per cent on all
sales wag also to have been paid Wickson. On
Friday last the Monarch company moved
from the Front-street store, so Wickson wants
$5000 damages for breach of contract and an
accounting of all sales made that tie may re
ceive his commission.
Dr. Barter's Address To-Day.
The mass-meeting of young men, only, at
the Christian Association building, Mason
and Eliis streets, to-day will be addressed by
Rev. William Rader, pastor of the Third Con
gregational Churcn. Seats will be free to all
young men. The singing will be led by D. M.
Lawrence. Service commences promptly at 3
o'clock.
Greater Speed on California Street.
Preparations are making for speeding the
California-street cable. The probability is that
this will lead to a reduction in the number of
cars on the line. This ts said to be the fact,
but very few cars will be taken off. At the
power-House it was said last night that not
over two cars will be dropped. No date has
been fixed for the change.

C. H, M. CURRY'S FUNERAL
Honors Paid to the Memory of
a Good Citizen and a
Faithful O.'ficer.
Rev. Dr. Dil c and W. H Barnes
Speak Kindly of His Many
Virtues-
The funeral of Charles H. M. Curry,
father of County Clerk C. F. Curry and
late grand reporter of the Grand Lodge of
Knights of Honor of the State of California,
was held at Central M. E. Church, on
Mission street, yesterday afternoon.
The popularity of the deceased among
the brethren of the Knights of Honor, as
also the Ancient Order of United Work
men, together with that of his son, C. F.
Curry, the present County Clerk of this
City, brought hundreds of mourners to
the church, all of whom came to pay their
last respects to him who had left them,
as also to sympathize with the members of
his family in their grief. Every seat in
the body of the church and galleries was
occupied.
As many deputy clerks, not only from
the County Clerk's office, but from other
co-ordinate branches of the municipality
as could be spared from official duty were
there. Sheriff Whelan, with a large rep
resentation from his office, occupied seats
immediately in the rear of the mourners.
Large delegations from Keystone
Lodge, Knights of Honor, under the call
of Charles H. Holcomb, dictator; members
of the Grand Lodge of the same order, un
der the call of P. L. Archibald, grand dic
tator, and from Yerba Buena Lodge of the
A. O. TJ. W M under the call of John W.
Rede, master workman, together with
others weTe present.
The entire space within the railing in
front of the pulpit was taken up with the
choicest collection of flowers to be had in
the City, skillfully worked into designs
representative of the office held by the
deceased. An open book'with tbe word
"Records" in pansies across one side rep
resented the duties of the reporter.
A vacant chair, a large harp, a vase, a
star, a broken wheel and other designs
too numerous to mention were there,
forming one of the grandest collections
probably ever seen at a funeral in this
City.
The funeral cortege was met at the
church door by the R:-v. Dr. Dille, who,
with the pall-bearers, J. F. Adam, W.
Venton, H. Schneffer, J. Wegroore, R. A.
Sumers, D. C. Martin, R. H. Warfield,
George W. Lamont, N. E. Maison, H. K.
McLennon, E. F. Joy and F. W. Zephns,
proceeded up the center aisle to the front
oi the pulpit, where the casket was placed
on a catafalque.
An appropriate hymn was sung by the
Masonic male quartet, under the direction
of Samuel E. Mayer, after which Dr. Dille
paid a high tribute to the sterling quali
ties of the deceased as a man and a Chris-'
tian.
He was described as one who had been
a constant attendant of that church for
the past twenty-three years, having been
superintendent of the Sabbath-school for
a number of years.
2^n concluding his remarks, he said :
"His sons may well feel proud of their
father and the history he left behind him.
Not one line would they if they could blot
out of his whole life, and he hoped that
they would lead a life as good and leave
as good a record behind them as he had
done, so that when there was a family
reunion on the golden shores of eternity
there would be no reproaches there as
there were none here.
"The family of the deceased was a happy
and a good family, because the head of it
was a good true man."
W. H. Barnes, a prominent officer of the

society of which the deceased was the re
porter, spoke feelingly of the great biÂ«
heart that through life beat within ti.o
breast of him whose memory will live as
long as the pages of the society of which
he was a true and trusted officer.
Words of praise were all that the speaker
could add to tne career of the late reporter,
who bad done so much through life for
the comfort and happiness of others.
After the services in the church the
friends and relatives passed round the
casket, taking the last, long look at the
genial face oi him who in life had a pleas
ant word and a warm shake of the hand
for all who approached him.
The services of tbe orders to which he
belonged were held at Laurel Hill Ceme
tery, where the interment will take place.
Judge Belcher's Sentences.
Judge Belcher ordered that B. Strassman,
wno for two years has been confined in the
County Jail awaiting trial on a charge of per
jury, be released. Strassman's brother, Leo,
was tried on the same charge, namely, of hav
ing sworn falsely in procuring a straw bond
on which Fehrenbacn, the half-interest
swindler, who recently committed suicide in
Kansas City, was released.
At the trial of Leo Strassman he was con
victed, but the Supreme Court recently grant
ed him a new trial. Judge Belcher therefore
ordered that B. Strassman be released.
Robert Phillips was sent to San Quentin for
five years for burglary and George Savanello,
a 14-year-old boy, convicted of assaulting a
schoolgirl, was sentenced to three years at ihe
Whittier Reform School.

MR, VINING'S OLD ROPE
How He Splices the Broken Cliff,
Park and Ferries
Cable.
And the Cars on Cay and Sacra
mento Streets Wait for
Him to Finish.
The Market-street Railroad Company is
having troublous times with the cable of
the Cliff, i>ark and Ferries line. So often
are the cars standing still on Clay and
Sacramento streets that the public is
thinking of utilizing them for waiting
rooms. The dummy or outside position
would be quite handy for men while the
interior of the closed car could be reserved
for ladies and children, especially for these
in rainy weather.
However, it is barely possible that Mr.
Vining would object. Mr. Vining objects
to posing as a philanthropist before the
people, which sometimes says naughty
things to him in the public press. The
superintendent of the Market-street Rail
road is a very patient person, and is
driven to live under considerable adverse
criticism, all of which he bears with be
coming fortitude.
Another drawback to the plan is, what
would the people be a-waiting for seated
in Mr. Vining's cars? Neither Sacramento
nor Jackson street is a place for the re
sort of idle folks, and if a busy public can
not be hauled anywhere by a cable that is
constantly undergoing repairs there is no
likelihood that they would wait in a
stationary coach for their business to be
hauled to them.
So the Market-street Railroad Company
picks up the broken strands of the Cliff,
Park and Ferries rope and lets the public
do its waiting on the sidewalk. Every
day and often twice a day that line is
stopped. It is no unusual thing to see
cars standing "dead" on Clay and Sacra
mento streets for hours.
Early last Thursday evening the cable
broke down, and the entire system had a
night off. Where the grade would permit
several cars were run down together and
all the employes would go home except
one gripman, who curled himself up in a
closed coach and enjoyed a sleep while
acting as watchman.
Not only is the public inconvenienced
Dy a worn-out cable that parts from sheer
old age, but the company never gives a
nickel back when the car stops. The pas
senger may sit there a while and then
hunt up another road. There is a distinct
element of danger about this matter of
persisting in the use of a worn-out rope.
Much of the road runs up and down steep
grades, and should a broken strand be
come mixed up with a grip while de
scending a hill nothing would prevent
that uncontrollable car from crashing
into a vehicle, a crowd or another car,
wrecking itself and injuring life.
A gripman and a conductor, under
promise that their names should not be
published, gave a Call reporter some in
teresting data regarding the frequent
breakdowns on Clay and Sacramento
streets.
'â¢The fact is," said those employes, "the
rope is crone in and cannot hold together.
When we are on our cars we are expecting
a stop every minute, if not an accident.
Sometimes the cable parts and again only
a strand breaks. Now let one of those
strands get entangled around a grip and
who can handle that car, especially on a
hill? And wnen the rope snaps wholly in
two on a steep place, all the cars coming
down or going up that hill are liable to
get away from the gripman.
"That cable should have been retired
long ago, but for some reason or other â
possibly the company is too poor to buy a
new oneâ they keep patching it. I under
stand that the road does not pay and the
managers will keep the old rope going if
the public wont patronize the line."
At 8 o'clock last evening the cable was
stopped for the third time in twenty-four
hours.
SUES THE COMPANY.
Litigation Over the Depoait or a Con
ductor Who Committed Suicide.
Dewey Coffin began suit in the Justices'
Court yesterday against the Market-street
Railroad Company to recover $25, a de
posit left by 0. T. Bern hard, the con
ductor who recently committed suicide
because of domestic troubles.
Bernhard left the deposit with the com
pany when engaged to indemnity the cor
poration against loss, /ust before he
killed himself he gave Coffin an order for
the money, which was presented after his
death. The company refused to honor
the demand, hence the suit.
Died In His Shop.
Rudolph Mullen, 505 Lyon street, a shoe
maker by occupation, was found dead in his
shop yesterday. The man has been missing
since Monday, but no one seemed to think it
necessary to examine his place of business.
The body was found lying on the shop floor
face downward, death from natural causes
having evidently occurred several days ago.
The deceased was not married, but leaves a
sisteT and a brother to share a small fortune
left by the deceased.
The Afro-American League.
President T. B. Morton has announced that
the Afro-American League of San Francisco
will hold a meeting on Monday evening at 8
o'clock sharp. The Women's League and all
colored citizens are cordially invited to attend
to hear the report of the president of the State
League and the delegates to the Afro-American
Congress, held in the city of Los Angeles
August 11 to 15. The meeting will be held at
California Hall, 620 Bush street, near Powell.
FACTS FROM THE RAILS
Gathering in This City of the
Santa Fe System Offi
cials.
Movements of Many Who Figure in
the Operations of Pacific Coast
Railways.
There has been what is described as a
chance gathering of officials connected
with the Santa Fe Railroad system in this
City during the past week. Each of the
gentlemen says that he came here for per
sonal and not on account of business
reasons. W. B. Biddle, the freight traffic
manager of the Santa Fe at Chicago, left
the City eastbound last night. His family
have been at San Dieeo, and he says that
he came out to bring them to the coast.
W. A. Culloden, auditor of the New
Mexico and Arizona and Sonora railways,
which are parts of the Santa Fe system, is
another of the party. He makes his head
quarters at Guaymas. Ed Chambers, tire
passenger agent ol the Southern California
road, has also been here during the weeK.
An amicable arrangement has been
reached between the Panama Railroad
Company and the stockholders of the old

GEORGE CORNWALL'S ESTATE.
Special Letters of Administration
Granted to One of His Widows.
The contest over the $175 due George W.
Cornwall, the Southern Pacific engineer
who recently died leaving behind him a
month's salary and three widows, waxes
warm ip Judge Coffey's court.
Yesterday Felicia B. Cornwall was ex
amined as to her relations with the de
ceased, it beng claimed by a brother of the
engineer that she was not his wife and
has no right to his name. During the
examination the fact was developed that
although the couple lived together as man
and wife for nineteen years, the paper
which the wife claimed to be her marriage
contract was years ago destroyed by the
husband. It also came to light that at t-he
time the contract wes made, Mrs. Corn
wall had another husband living. She
claimed, however, to have been divorced
before the contract with Cornwall was
signed.
A document drawn up by Cornwall in
which he and Felicia B. Cornwall for
mally agreed to a legal separation was
introduced, as was a deed in which he
acknowledged her as his wife. On this
showing Judge Coffey granted her special
letters of administration.
