VOLUME LXXX.â NO. 146.
WHAT CHARLES L . TAYLOR WOULD DO IF MAYOR
If elected Mayor of San
Francisco I shall do all in my
power to secure a judicious
and economical administra
tion of public affairs.
I shall do all I can to
â¢â  secure to every citizen the
f ul 1 benefits guaranteed under
the constitution of the United
States and the laws of Cali
fornia.
If f become Mayor my mind
will be absolutely free from
prejudice toward any class
of citizens. People of every
religion may firmly rely upon
me to pursue a policy of
; even-handed justice, without
regard to creed, sect or color.
I am not a corporation tool
or a corporation hater. I have
opposed the unjust reduction
of assessments on coroora
tion property and I have
equally opposed the granting
of valuable franchises, except
for a fair revenue on the
earnings for the City.
I believe in doing every
thing within reason for the
health and general welfare of
the City. This involves good
sev/ers, a well-equipped Fire
Department and an active in
terest in streets, parks and
general public improvements.
I am opposed to bosses and
jobbery, to unjust aggressions
on the rights of the people
and to all forms of corporate
and private encroachments on
liberty that rob the people of
their rights under the law.
Every law against the best
interests of taxpayers and
workingmen should be re
pealed.
I believe in an economical
and progressive administra
tion of municipal government
No extravagant appropriations
should ever be made.
Franchises should never be
granted to corporations or cit
izens without due profits for
the masses.
I favor a policy that charges
corporations for franchises.
The City ought to reap
millions for the valuable rights
it sells to corporations.
The Mayor ought to hide
his personal wishes and hear
k both sides of every case.
The Mayor should be a
man of such standing as will
cause all classes to feel that
their interests will be safe in
his hands.
We want a Mayor who
favors good roads, the im
provement of parks and
squares and the bettering of
the City's sewer system.
Our sewer system ought to
be scientific and lasting, thus
conducing to the health of the
people.
Good roads are a mark of
civilization. Every highway
in the County ought to be in
excellent condition.
I The Mayor of San Fran
cisco ought to know the peo
ple and their wants, and should
have the courage to oppose

their enemies and advocate
their interests.
A Mayor, like a Judge,
ought to follow law and jus
tice in every case and give
every person a fair hearing.
The Mayor ought to do all
in his power to see that every
department of the Govern
ment is efficiently adminis
tered, and he should be in
touch with every branch of
the administration.
Golden Gate Park ought to
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 24, 1896.
be maintained in its present
excellent condition on a lib
eral allowance.
Nothing is of more vital
importance than our public
school system, and it should
be maintained on a high
plane. The rights of parents,
pupils and teachers should
be subserved.
San Francisco needs a
Mayor who believes in doing
everything in reason for the
public health. To this end
the sewer system ought to be
improved and the well
known rules of health en
forced.
I believe in vigorously pros
ecuting suits for the posses
sion of all lands that belong
to the City.
The Mayor should not be
the first man to try a new
plan, nor the last to abandon
an old, for the government of
the City.
The City's Fire Depart
ment should be first class in
every par icular. There ought
to be the best possible equip
ments for putting out fires.
In adjusting water rates the
City's rulers should eliminate
prejudice fr m the problem.
These questions ought to be
settled on safe,* conservative
lines without malice and
without fear of either the
corporation or the people.
I think the Mayor ought to
conscientiously study the in
terests of the masses and act
in accordance with his con
science. He should have no
friends to humor and no ene
mies to punish.
The Mayor of San Fran
cisco ought not to hold him
self above the approach of
the humblest citizen. The
richest man should not be
granted a favor that the hum
blest cannot obtain.
While nothing should be
done to curtail legitimate ex-J
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
penses in the administration
of municipal affairs, the Mayor
and other officers ought at all
times to check extravagance
and a waste of the people's
money.
Everything within reason
ought to be done to make the
Police Department efficient
and in every way ample to
guarantee protection to life
and property.
I believe in being aggres
sive for the right, fearless of
the evil-doers and vigilant
where the liberties of the
masses are concerned.
The Mayor of the City ought
to know the people of all
classes, ought to keep in
touch with all sorts and con
ditions of men, so as to be
able to pass intelligently on
questions affecting all shades
of the population.
If business men regard the
Mayor as a demagogue they
do not respect him, and if the
poor regard him as the tool of
jobbers they hate him. The
Mayor's endeavor should be
to be just to all classes.
Business sagacity, a knowl
edge of the City and its
wants and the desire to be
progressive and fair should
characterize the ambition of
one who wants to be Mayor
of San Francisco.
If elected Mayor no man or
corporation need fear any act
of mine unless it fears an
honest hearing and a fair trial.
The Mayor of a city is not
called upon to put his own
views forward offensively on
any question. He is an ex
ecutive officer, and his chief
business is passing on ques
tions that pertain to the wel
fare of the people.
The Mayor of this City
should not be under obliga
tions to factions of any kind. t
His sole guide should be the
law.
The affairs of this City
should be administered on
strictly business principles,
just as an honest man would
administer the affairs of a great
commercial institution.
The chief executive of a
city ought to remember that
the office he holds is not his
private affair and that he is
only the servant of the peo
ple.
The Mayor ought to give to
the City his time and best
abilities, noting closely every
affair that demands conscien
tious attention, remaining ever
vigilant where important in
terests of his constituents
are at stake.

LOTS OF GOLDEN COLOKS SEEN.
The Theory of Sixteen to One Illus

When the Rain Falls.
PEORIA. 111., Oct. 23.â Mr. Bryan's
first day in his work of rounding up in
Illinois took him across tbe central part
of the State, beginning at Danville in the
morning and ending at Peoria this even
ing. Rain fell at some of the earlier
places where be spoke, but beyond a raw
ness in the air the rest of the day was not
bad for campaigning. There were some
novelties introduced in the receptions
given the candidate. He rode through
the streets of Decatur in a horseless car
riage and at Mattoon was carried from the
train to the place where the speaking
took place on a decorated platform on
wheels.
The wildness of the welcomes given the
candidate at Decatur was almost unpre
cedented in his campaign. It was impos
sible to get through the throngs that
pressed between his carriage and both the
platforms from which he was expected to
speak, and he addressed bis audiences in
each instance from the vehicle. Two
speeches were made at Sprineneld, the
State capital, and the home of Senator
John M. Palmer, who is in the race for
the Presidency on the cold ticket Gov
ernor Altgeld was fulfilling his engage
ments elsewhere in the State and conse
quently could not welcome the head of
tue National ticket. The meetings at
Decatur, Springfield and Peoria were at
tended by great crowds.
Mr. Bryan spoke twice in each of these
cities and also talked at Danville, Paris,
Charleston, Mattoon, Sullivan, Peters
burg, Havana and Pekin. The train was
in charge of Colonel W. S. Cantrel, Rail
road and Warehouse Commissioner of
Illinois, and through hia efforts Mr. Bryan
was able to fulfill his engagements with
greater promptitude than on other days.
Sixteen speeches was tbe day's record. At
11:30 o'clock to-night Mr. Bryan left Peo
ria for Ottawa, where be will begin his
speech- making to-morrow morning.
PEORIA, 111.. Oct. 23.â W. J. Bryen's I
struggle for Illinois began early this morn
ing under lowering skies and in an atmos
phere that c ailed to the bone. His initial
speech of the Illinois campaign began at
Danville. It was only 8:30 o'clock when
Mr. Bryan arrived there, but 8000 people
were gathered in the Courthouse square,
where tbe. speaking took place. A wild
demonstration occurred when Mr. Bryan |
appeared and th- enthnsiasm broke forth
again several times dunne his remark?. In
his Danville speech Mr. Bryan quoted his
old Congressional colleague. Hon. Joseph j
Cannon, a resident of Danville, with ref
erence to free coinage.
It was half-past 9 when Paris was
reached. There Mr. Bryan was cordially
welcomed by between 3000 and 4000 peo
ple, nearly every one of whom wore the j
name of Bryan on his or her hat. During i
the twenty minutes spent here Mr. Bryan
made a speech from the balcony of the
Courthouse and was vigorously cheered.
It was raining when Mr. Bryan reached
Charleston. Beside the car was a big dec
orated platform, and when Mr. and Mrs.
Eryan stepped upon it the structure, to
tneir surprise, began to move up the street.
It was a big wagon covered with boards
and drawu by horses. Four thousand
people heard the candidate speak and
cbeered him loudly.
Every white horse in the vicinity of Mat
toon, a railroad center which Mr. Bryan
visited on his trip from Chicago to Saleru,
his old home, just after his nomination,
had been pressed into service to assist
several sets of silver-clad young men to
carry out the symbolization of 16 to 1.
Several golden queens, each with sixteen
silver maids of honor, were obliged to put
up their umbrellas and fi^e from the hard
rain that began to fall as tbe candidate
etepped from his train. A crowd of 6000,
masse I compactiy, composed Mr. Bryan's
audience.
Mr. Bryan devoted part of his remarks
to praise of Governor Altgeld, of whom be
said: "1 am glad to be in Illinois, because
you have as a Democratic leader in this
State and as your candidate for Governor
one of silver's ablest champions. [Cheer
ing for Altgeld.]
Although Sullivan was not down on the
schedule 2000 people were waiting for Mr.
Bryan there. Senator Allison was ex
pecte ; later in the day and in preparation
for his coming a number of those who
heard a little speech from the Democratic
candidate were decorated with orange
badges. Women wore golden hats and
men golden sashes ami horses and ve
hicles were also trimmed in that color.
In view of .Senator Allison's promised
presence Mr. Bryan had something to say
about tbe lowa statesman. Senator Alli
son, he said, in explaining in the Senate
â oon after the passage of the de
monetization act, said that when the
secret history was written it would
be found tbat there was fraud in
the passage of tbe demonetization act;
and yet the Republican party to-day
places itself on record as being in favor of
continuing that which was secured by
fraud.
A stop of a minute was made at
Bethany, where a small crowd heard a
few words from the candidate, and tbe
train slowed down as it passed a couple of
hundred people gathered on the platform
at Dalton City.
The heartiest sort of a reception was
given Mr. Bryan at Decatur. His pres
ence at Springfield for an hour was made
the occasion of a great demonstration in
his honor. Nine excursion trains brought
crowds of visitors and a number of politi
cal organizations. The local supporters of
the Chicago ticket and those from neigh
boring counties made a holiday of the af
fair. All along tbe line of march over
which Mr. Bryan was escorted by many
organizations, mounted and on foot, num
bering 4000 persons, he and his wife were
cheer d. Fifteen thousand people heard
Mr. Bryan from the steps of the Court
house and cheered vigorously at every op
portunity. When he had finished there
be was taken to the State House, and
made another speech to an audience
equally large and quite as demonstrative.
Three speeches were made by Mr. Bryan
on his trip from Springfield to Peoria.
There were 3000 people at Petersburg,
â bout 5000 at Havana and 7000 at Pekin.
In both his Springfield speeches Mr.
Bryan urged bis hearers to keep Illinois
in the Democratic column, his Courthouse
speech being addressed mainly to the
workingmen in his audience.
The reception given by Peoria, the sec
ond city in Illinois, to Bryen to-uight was
all that could be desired by the candidate.
His progress through tne streets was
marked by continued chesring. Peoria
dispensed with tbe usual triumphal
chariot drawn by four horses, and sub
stituted in its place an open trolley-car,
brilliantly illuminated and profusely dec
orated, to convey Mr. Bryan from the
Union station to the Tabernacle, where he
made his first speech. The spacious build
ing was filled to overflowing with an audi
ence that showed tremeuddus enthusiasm.
Mr. Bryan spoke for more than an hour,
concluding at 9:35 o'clock, and was then
taken to Rouses Hall, which has a smaller
seating space. This, too, was packed.
Concluding a brief speech there, tbe can
didate went to the Courthouse, where he
addressed an open-air meeting, composed
of about 10.000 people. In his Tabernacle
speech Mr. Bryan referred to the indig
nities shown Secretary Carlisle at Coving
ton last night and strongly deprecated
them.
DISGRACEFUL TO KENTUCKY.
Sentiment of the Indignities Offered
Carlitil* by bileerites.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 23.â The
treatment ot Secretary Carlisle at Coving
ton last night was the subject of earnest
talk among politicians of both parties in
this city to-day. Democratic leaders de
nounce and disavow tbe actions of those
who assaulted the Secretary, and Republi
cans, while condemning the sets com
mitted, profess the belief that the insult
will help tbe cause of sound money in
that State and elsewhere.
"The conduct of the crowd at Secre
tary Carlisle's meeting in Covington last
night," said Chairman Babcock of the
Republican Congressional Committee,
"cannot be condemned in terms too se
vere. Secretary Carlisle is an honored son
of that State, one of her representative
citizens, and went there to speak for the
cause in which he believed. He was en
titled to d cent treatment under any cir
cumstances, but especially was heentitled
to it in bis own borne town and among
the people with whom he was personally
acquainted. The conduct of the crowd in
assaulting the Secretary was an attack
not only upon the man, but upon the
bijrh office :.e holds."
This rowdyism, be said, will lose tbe
party represented by the men who com
mitted this dastardly attack thousands of
vote^.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 23.â Chairman By
num of the National Democratic Party
Campaign Committee returned to bead
quarters after an absence of several days
in Ind ana making speeches. He said a
change of no mean proportions was ob
servable throughout tbe State in favor of
tbe gold advocatas, and tbat every day
would only add to tbe assured victory by
a majority larger than ever before given
in Indiana at a Presidential election.
Tne indignities offered to Secretary Car
lisle in Covington last night were dis
cussed at headquarters and the consensus
of opinion was tbat such treatment would
do more good to the Palmer ticket than
anything which has happened since the
campaign opened. Vice-Chairman Hop
kins said:
"It was -an outrage, pure and simple,
and one that will be severely rebuked by
the voters of Kentucky, as well as the
Nation, at the poll-. While I don't say
that the assault was premeditated by the
leaders of the silver faction, 1 do claim
they must have noticed tbat something oi
tne sort was going ie happen, and, there
fore, ought to have taken precautions to
prevent it. It seems almost impossible
tbat any crowd of Kentuckians could so
insult such a distinguished fellow-citizen."
Generals Palmer and Buckner will spend
one day in Bland's Congressional district
in Missouri, and another day in St. Louis.
General Buckner wired headquarters to
day asking to be relieved from speaking
in Lincoln. Nebr., and the itinerary will
be changed accordingly in Nebraska.
WATS MAY WITHGRAW.
That May Be the Henull of Hit Confer'
, â  ence With . n~a* hburn. ,
NASHVILLE, Tens.; Oct. 23.â Populist
candidate Thomas ,E. : Watson t was met
here to-day by National , Populist Com
mitieeman Wash burn, in conjunction
with local Populists, and held a confer
ence lasting several hours. All those in
the conference are very close-mouthed
about what was done. Mr. 'Wash burn said
he simply laid before Mr. Watson the re
suit of bis conference with .Chairman
Jones. He said since the conference with
Chairman Jones fusion had been refused
Populists in several States, and therefore
nothing of any import occurred \ to-day.
He said that things would remain in Btatu
quo to the end of the campaign. i ;
Candidate Watson ' spoke - here to-night
to an audience of 1000. He reiterated bis
opposition to fusion and attacked Mr.
Sewall. He said he proposed to do all he
could to elect Bryan, but could not with
out violation of principles assist in the
election of Sewall. v.
It is believed that as a result of the con
ference between ; Populist Committeeman
Washburn, acting for Senator Jones, and
Populist Committeeman Reed of \ Georgia
and Thomas E. Watson, that Watson will
withdraw. . . . ; .
The three were in conference all day and
again to-night after Watson's speech. Mr.
Watson was called out of the conference
by a reporter and asked if he intended to
withdraw. He absolutely declined to say
anything one way or the other, but added
that he might have something important
to say to-morruw.

enthusiastically applauded for his thrusts
at the free-siiver candidate and cause.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1869.
AS TO COERCION
OF WORKINGMEN
Chairman Hanna Says It
Virtually Means Simple
Bribery.
Men Who Labor for a Living
Are Neither Fools Nor
Slaves.
ATTEMPT TO FOMENT TROUBLE
Those Who Seek to Destroy Peaceful
Relations Between Employer and
Employe Are Dishonest
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 23.â Chairman
Hanna of the Republican National Com
mittee to-day issued a statement in reply
to yesterday's bulletin from Democratic
headquarters, in whic > workmen were
requested to ask their employers for coo
tracts insuring them against a reduciion
of wages in the event of McKinley's elec
tion. Mr. Hanna said:
"It is suggested that employers bribe
their workmen to vote for McKinley by
promising them higher wages or a con
tinuance of their present wages. In the
event that the employers will not be co
erced, then the employe is to vote for
Bryan; not becanse lie believes Bryan is
best fitted for the Presidency or repre
sents principles that will advance the in
terests of the American people, but be
cause bis employer may not deem it a
wise business policy to sign a contract in
the matter of wages. This is simply in
citing the workingman to exact a bribe
before he will vote. It is, not suggested
that be be governed by any principle.
Plainly speaking, they are advised to in
form him that he must bribe them in the
matter of wages or they will vote against
his interest.
"It has always been my opinion that
the interests of the employes and their
employer are identical. As I said in a re
cent statement, 1 do not believe working
men are foolish enough or slavish enough
to be coerced, nor do I believe they are
despotic enough to attempt to coerce their
employers.
"This seditious bulletin is intended to
foment trouble between capital and labor.
I would advise tbe workingmen to vote
according to their conscientious opinions.
If they have any business to transact with
their employers they can do it better upon
business than upon political grounds.
But I am not surprised at this develop
ment in tbe Bryan campaign. It has
beeu evident for some time that it was the
intention of the Bryan managers to create
labor troubles as a part of their plan of
campaign. And this is an open step in
that direction. They would precipitate a
general strike before the election. Men
who would connive to destroy peaceful
relations existing between capital and
labor are none too good to do even worse."
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 23.â The press de
partment of the Democratic National
campaign headquarters to-night issued a
long reply to the statement which eman
ated earlier in the day from Republican
Chairman Hanna as an answer to the
Democratic advice to workmen to insist
on an agreement with employers not to
reduce wages at least within the next two
years as a trust of the latter's belief in the
claim that McKinley was the "advance
agent of prosperity." The Democratic
reply in part states:
"Hanna has killed tho Republican party
and committed political suicide. His bul
letin issued this afternoon destroys tbe
last chance of McKinley's election. It
proves every charge made against Hanna's
labor record. It is the most stupendous
piece of folly ever committed in the name
of politics. The chairman of the Repub
lican National Committee practically ad
mits that â¢ McKinley's election will be
followed by a general reduction in wages.
Mark Hanna is the official representative
of 'McKinley and prosperity.'
"His form of prosperity seems to consist
in a general reduction of wages and tbe
denial of the right of contract or of humble
petition. Mr. Hanna's 'sedition circular'
purports to be an answer to a circular
issued by Chairman Jones of tbe Demo
cratic National Committee. It is nothing
of the kind. It is a manifesto launched
aeainst a newspaper clipping, which is
part of a daily service supplied to papers
by the press bureau of the Democratic
National Committee. It shows that Mark
Hanna has finally introduced into politics
his private methods of subjugating labor.
"In making this statement Mr. Hanna
tacitly admits that no honest employer
with ordinary business sagacity will bind
himself to pay the present scale of wages
after election. He knows that wages must
fall. He knows that tbey would have
been reduced before this had not an elec
tion been pending. Much as Mr. Hanna
and his associate/ Mr. Payne, would like
a strike at this time, with an opportunity
to call out tbe army and militia, they will
be doomed to disappointment."
TEMPTED BY A WOMAN.
Downfall of an Employe Who lied a
Rather Gay Life.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 23.â A special to a
morning paper from New Orleans says: J.
E. Bassett, an employe and bookkeeper of

Whitney in Control.'
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 23.â The ques
tion of a new motive power for the Metro
politan Traction Company has produced
some feeling between Directors William C.
Whitney and John D. Crim rains. Whitney
favors compressed air as a motive power,
while Crimmins thinks electricity would
be better. It is said tbat Whitney is now
in absolute control of the Metropolitan
Traction affairs. Frederick S. Pearson,
chief engineer of the company, has sailed
for Europe to examine the compressed-air
systems in Paris, Berlin and Dresden.

SHOT DOWN BY A NEGRO.
Two White Women the Victims of a
Worth/ess Husband, Who Tries to
Commit Suicide.
CHICAGO. 111., Oct. 23.â RoÃerto Ãert Emery
shot his wife, Annie, and a Mrs. Millei to
night, and later fired a bullet into his own
head. Eaaery is a negro and both the
women are white. The affair happened at
43 North Sangamon street, a neighborhood
where white and colored people mingle
together. Mrs. Emery has been support
ing her colored husband, and upon refus
ing to do so longer has been much abused.
To-night the two women were together in
the Miller apartments, when Emery came
in. After a few harsh words he fired two
shots at his wife.
Tbe Miller woman ran, but was brought
down with a bullet from Emery's revol
ver. Emery then ran out of the house
and was pursued by a crowd, which had
quickly gathered. He ran a number of
blocks, chased by a mob which was in
creasing all the time. When he found he
could not outdistance his pursuers he
drew his revolver and shot himself in the
head, falling immediately to the pave
ment. Had the crowd not supposed him
dead be would have received roueb treat
ment at its hands. Tbe three people are
now in the County Hospital.
CONSIDERINDIANSCHOOLS
Cardinal Gibbons Confers With
Archbishops Ryan and
Kain.
As to the Catholic University There
Is Now the Utmost Harmony
in Affairs.
BALTIMORE, Md., Oct. 23.â Cardinal
Gibbons and two other prelates of the
Catholic churchâ Archbishops Ryan and
Kain â held a conference in this city to-day
to further consider the subject of Indian
schools. In Washington yesterday Mon
stgnor Sieohan, head of the Catholic
Bureau of Indian Missions, appeared De
fore tbe churchmen and made a statement
of the condition of tbe schools under its
charge, with a view to determining what
course shall be taken when Government
aid is withdrawn on July 1 next. He re
ported that $198,228 of Government money
was available this year, which is a 50 per
cent reduction from last year.
The Cardinal announced at the close of
the conference that about $60,000 bad been
apportioned among the Indian and negro
schools of tbe country, but declined to
give details of the apportionment. His
Eminence regrets that the impression has
gone out that thero were any dissensions
in the dhectorate of the Catholic Univer
sity.
"It is due to the university," he says,
"that these ideas should be corrected, and
that tbe true slate of affairs should be
shown.
"As the result of the affair, from the re
moval of Kishop Keane until the conclu
sion of the meeting of the Archbishops
yesterday, there was more unanimity of
opinion, more friendly feeling and more
harmony among the prelates ana board
than has been in evidence for some time.
"Whatever difference may have been in
the past, or may be in tbe future, it is as
sured tbat there are none existing now.
This gives strong hopes that tbe lines so
sbarpiy drawn immediately after the re
moval of Bishop Kcane will entirely disap
pear. It will be the earnest effort of all
the niembers of the hierarchy to see that
this is done."

BAKER IS BEATEN -
BY DAN CREEDON
The Chicago Pugilist No
Match for the Swift
Australian.
Only in the First Round Was
the Victor Worried by
His Opponent.
I CONSIDERABLE BLOOD FLOWS.
At the End of tbe Twentieth Round
tbe Referee Decided the Match
in Favor cf Creedon.
NEW YORK. N. V., Oct. 23.â Dan CTee
don whipped Hnrry Baker of Chicago in
tbe twenty-round bout at the Empire
Athletic Club to-night. It was rather a
tame fight, but the Australian did most of
the work, save in the first round, when a
couple of hard swings from Baker brought
Creedon to his Knees. The Australian
was on the offensive the greater part of
every round and deserved the decision.
Baker did not display much science, but if
he bad landed any of the terrific swings
which he aimed at Creedon the latter
would have been quickly put to sleep.
Among the spectators were Robert Fitz
simmons and Martin Julian. The latter
announced that Fitzaimmons and Sbarkey
were matched to meet on December 9at
tbe National Athletic Club, San Francisco.
Fitzsimmons said he would fight Corbett
four weeks afterward.
The preliminary bout, ten rounds be
tween Joe Bernstein and Frank Heaterson,
was declared a draw. The big fellows lost
no time in appea-ing.
Tbe betting was 10 to 7 on Creedon.
Baker was attended by Harry Tuthill,
Danny McMabon, John Overs and Harry
Black; Creedon by Sam Fitzpatrick,
Paddy Gorman and Benny Murphy. Tim
Hurst was referee. Baker's hands were
bandaged, but on an appeal from Cree
don's seconds be removed tbe raga. Both ,
claimed to weigh 160 pounds, but Creedon
looked ten pounds heavier.
Baker was first to land with a light left
in the face and Creedon sent a good left on
tbe face. The- latter was much the clev
erer, apparently, tapping bis man at will,
until a right and left on both sides of the
jaw staggered him. Light sparring fol
lowed, aad Baker swung a right on the
jaw that sent Creedon to the floor on his
hands and knees just as the bell rang.
In the second round both landed body
blows and Creedon sent in several left
handers, while Baker appeared rattled and
was unable to return.
Baker rushed in the third, but fell a bit
short on two vicious swings. Tbe Austral
ian punched his man right and left on the
jaw and body, and, taking a straight left
on the face, returned it with a right cross
on the jaw. There were some lively ex
changes in the fourth, of which Baker had
a bit the best of it. Creedon's nose was
bleeding freely at the close, and Baker's
nasal organ was also damaged. Neither
did any damage in the fifth and aixib.
They started to make tbings lively in
the seventh, in which Creedon forced tbe
fighting. Baker then took a hand, and
with a stunning right, on tbe jaw made
the Australian spin round and clinch to
save himself.
Baker sent a left to the jaw and put tbe
right on the stomach after the opening of
the eighth. It was a tame fight. Creedcn
was doing the work, but his blows did not
appear effective and most of them were
stopped.
Creedon opened the tenth with a jab on
the face, but took a hard left in the
stomach, which was repeated a moment
later. Baker then rushed, but slipped
and fell on bis hand 3 and knees. Dan put
hard lefts on the jaw twice, forcing his
man to tbe ropes. Baker jabbed Dan on
tbe face, bring tbe blood freely, and just
as tbe bell rang Dan landed a stinging left
on the wind.
In the eleventh Baker ran into a hard
swing on the bo<ly that lilted him off his
feet, and, as Creedon kept right after his
man, Baker was pretty well cooked when
the bell rang.
Baker led in tbe twelfth, but was
stopped, and Dan then chased his man all
over the ring.
In the next two rounds no effective
work was done. Baker seemingly keeping
away. The fifteenth also was tame until
just as the gonÂ« rang Creedon sent two
bard lefts to the jaw that seemed to daze
tbe Chicagoan.
The sixteenth was uninteresting, bet in
the seventeenth Creedon Bbot several
straight lefts on the jaw, and had ail the
best of the round.
Baker made a couple of desperate 7 efforts
to put his man out in the eighteenth, but
Ci eerion got out of danger and sent the
right on tbe jaw, staggering his man.
Baker punched the Australian on the
nose after tbey came up for the nine
teenth. They mixed things up, and Baker
put a hot one on the wind while Creedon
paid his respects to the jaw.
Both came up fairly fresh for the last
rouud. Baker put a left on tho jaw, and
then the Australian pasted his man on
the jaw and body. There were some ex
changes, of which Creedon bad the best,
though Baker was strong when the bell
rang. The referee decided in favor of
Creedon.

STREETCAR EMPLOYES.
Managers Not Careful Enough
in Selecting Motormen
x and Conductors.
Reading and Waiting Rooms Should
Bo Established and Prizes
Given for Proficiency.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 23. â The final
session of the fifteenth annual convention
of the American Street Railway Associa
tion was held in the convention audi
torium building this morning. After the
installation of officers W. F. Keliey of
Columbus, Ohio, read a paper on "Se
lection and Management of Employes."
Mr. Keliey thinks managers are not
careful enough in the selection of motor
men and conductors. They will not buy
a car or appliance without a thorough
investigation, but they will employ a man
offhand. A street railway employe should
possess sound judgment, and entertain
neither communistic, socialistic nor an
archistic views. Mr. Keliey thinks it un
wise to select employes from men who
have been employed as policemen, fire
men, steam railroad men or political ap
pointees.
The speaker favored the giving of prizes
for proficiency. He thinks the establish
ment of comfortable reading and waiting
rooms for the comfort of the men neither
generosity nor charity, bnt pood business
sense. It is more than paid for by the
suoerior service the men render.
At the conclusion of the discussion, the
convention adjourned sine die.
THE WENTISGRAUSE CASE.
It Causes an Exhibit of Air Brakes in
~~ ':â  ..â â  the Supreme Court. Â»â¢â¢â  "Â«.:. "'.*'.â¢ '^ r '\
WASHINGTON, D..C./ Oct. -23.â Just
before the Supreme Court of the United
States adjourned this afternoon the c am
ber took i on the appearance of a carshop,
with that part of it where air brakes are
put on in f nil operation. This was due to
the exhibits made by counsel in the case
of the VWeitinghouse Air-brake Company
et al. The litigation arose over the manu
i facture of an sir brake for â  freight trains
by the Boyden'Compaay, which the West
inghouse Company ' claimed was an in
fringement of their patent. The Court of
Appeals for the Fourth . Circuit decided
against the Westinghouse Company, hold
ing that there was no infringement of two
claims of their patent, and that said
claim was fatally defective. The t judg
ment was in conflict with the decision of
the "i Second Circuit Court '-. of Appeals,
which sustained the validity of the patent.
The Supreme Court at its last term or
dered the case brought before it for re
view and advanced it on the docket for an
early ~ hearing ; , this term. George H.
Christy, '-, counsel for the Westinghouse
Company, began the argument, but had
not concluded when the court adjourned.

McKINLEVS WISE WORDS
Not a Scarcity of Money That Trou
bles the Country, but a Lack
of Employment.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 23.â Damp, cool
air and leaden skies greeted tbe pilgrims
Wbo came to Canton to-day, but neither
chill autumn winds nor gray, threatening
clouds are pot nt enough to check the
flow of incoming delegations or repress
the ardor of Major McKinley's visitors.
The enthusiasm grows more intense as tbe
day of election approaches, and the march
to Canton will not ceas9 until November
S. Five delegations came to-day.
The coming of a delegation of working
railway men from Kansas was an event of
enough importance, even in a town so ac
customed to tbe sight of delegations as
Canton, to arouse deep interest and to
draw from the citizens warm expressions
of appreciation, coupled with manifesta
tions of cordial hospitality. The delega
tions to-day were as versatile in character
as ever. Major McKinley was in excel
lent spirits, and addressed his visitors
with vigor and eloquence.
Sixteen delegations are expected to
morrow and Major McKiniey will make
not fewer than a dozen speeches.
It was long after sunset last evening
when Major McKinley addressed a dele
gation of Indiana Republicans. They
were the last callers of the day. Before
sunrise this morning there was another
party of visitors from the Hoosier State
who came to Canton to pay their respects
to the Republican candidate for President.
They were the first callers to-day. The
delepation represented Logans-port, New
castle, Kokomo and Richmond. After
breakfast the party was escorted to Major
McKinley's residence by the Canton citi
zens' committee. W. H. Elliott of the
Newcastle Courier acted as spokesman
Major McKinley in responding spoke as
follows:
Nothing but a deep concern for the future of
the country would have induced tbis body of
my countrymen to travel all night that they
might bring assurances of support to the great
Republican cause this year, because they be
lieved that enveloped in that cause are the
highest and best interests of our common
country. I am glad to welcome you to my
homo and am glad to have the assurance of
your spokesman that the fires ot Republican
ism ; re glowing so brightly in the State of
Harrison, that splendid and patriotic states
man, and the home of th&t other great states
man and war Governorâ Oliver P. Morton-
The cry is that we have not enough money.
Now everybody knowt that is not true. We
never had such prosperous times as in 1892
and we have just as much money now as we
had then. It is not a lack of money that is at
iault; it is the difficulty of putting men to
work and creating markets for our products.
You cannot make fifty-two cents a dollar
and make a gold dollar worm 100 cents circu
late alongside of it. The gola dollar wi.l go
out and every paper dollar based on gold will
go out and there will be less circulating me
dium, and instead ot the good money we have
now we shall have poor money. Can you tell
me how the free coinage of silver is going to
help business? It will not increase the de
mand for anything but silver. There will be
an increase in the production of silver, but
then down goes the price of silver, and then
you will have to consult your paper every
morning to see what silver is worth. [A
voice, "I have been in Mexico, and know that
is so."] We do not want such money in the
United States. We want dollars worth 100
cents. It la the lost job that is troubling us.
It is not money, but the lost market that is
troubling us.
Major McKinley was greeted with a
shout when he stepped out on his porch
at noon to address 200 Santa Fe Railroad
men from Emporia and Topeka, Kans. I
The delegation came a thousand miles to I
Bee Major McKinley, and the men had I
been on the cars for thirty-four hours, i
but tneir enthusiasm was unbounded.
They cheered and shouted and applauded
for several minutes. The committee with
the delegation was W. H. Simpson,
Â£. W. Cunningham and H. B. Morse, i
all of Emporia. Mr. Morse, wbo is
president of the Railwayman's Sound
money Club of Emporia, was se
lected as spokesman, and A. M. Baird of
Topeka, a foreman in the raiiroad-shops,
introduced him. This delegation came a
greater distance to visit McKinley than
any of his other callers. Major McKinley
said to the Kinsas delegation :
You have journeyed farther than any other i
delegation of the United States that has j
honored me with a vi6it to my home, ana I i
appreciate your visit morÂ« than I can find <
words to speak. It shows better than any j
words thai could be uttered what is in your i
minds aud hearts and what your purposes are
In the election to be held on the 3d of Novem
ber. You are interested in the prosperity- of
your country. There was a time whea some
men were in the habit of saying it did not
make any difference to the railroad men of the
country what kind of a financial policy we
had or what kind of a tariff policy we pursued.
I have heard it a thousand time? from the
rostrum that while the tariff might help those
engaged in the factories, it bad no influence
upon the wages of the men who were engaged
upon the great transportation lines of the
country.
If any one of you believed that statement four
years ago you do not believe it now, because
you know that upon the general prosperity of
the country depends the prosperity of our
great railroads and upon tneir prosperity
depends your employment and wages. You
will have nothing to do if there is nothing to
haul, and the more there is to haul the more
and steadier employment you will have and
the better wages you will get for your services
and for your families.
A delegation unique in character came
next. It was composed of memuers of the
State Association of Pennsylvania Direc
tors an.J Overseers of the Poor. The asso
ciation has been holding its annual ses
sion in Pittsbnrg and the members decided
to call on Major McKiney before depart
ing for their homes. J. D. Groff intro
duced the assembled directors of the poor.
The fourth delegation was a large one
from several counties in Southwestern
Ohio. There were 1400 voters in the party.
Frank M. Hoffman of Van Wert, Repub
lican candidate for member of the State
Board of Public Works, was spokesman.
The last delegation and the largest one
of the day came from Armstrong County,
Pennsylvania. There were 2500 in line
I when the -ielepation marched up to Major
McKinley's with its band playine lively
airs. The spokesman was Congressman
H. D. Heiner. It was his opinion that
Pennsylvania will rive a Republican
plural ty of nearly 400,000. Robert Nay
smith spoke for t c piate-trlaÂ«<s workers in
the delation and pr-senied Major Mc-
Kinley with a large mirror, made at a fac
tory in Foru City.

CHICAGO. 111., Oct. Thomas Lloyd,
editor-in-chief of the London Statist, who
is making a tour of the United States to
study the political conditions, to-day
cabled his paper as follows:
"Several politicians from the South and
West are now in Chicago, which at first
sight uives the impression that there is
more difference of political opinion 'here
than in New York, but in reality 1 find
that the people of Chicago, at least all of
them who have anything to lose, are sup
porters of McKinley. Mr. Hanna, who is
the organizer of the Republican party,
speaks very confidently. He says he. is
certain of carrying Illinois, Michigan and
Indiana, and he has strong hopes of win
ning several Southern and Western States. ;
"On the other hand, Mr. Bryan's com- ;
mittee speaks equally confident. It does ',
rot expect as large a majority as Mr.
Hanna says he is sure of, but it professes
to be convinced that it will win. The
main doubt of those who apeak impar
tially is as to the farmers and the labor
ers. It is believed that the rise in \vhea ;
and cotton, as well as the active cam
' paign that has been conducted for several
months, have convinced a great number
of farmers; and great numbers of the
working classes promise to vote for Mc-
Kinley, but many with whom I have dis
cussed the subject fear that a large pro
portion of the workingmen promise their
employers one thing and will vote quite
i differently when the day comes.
"It is noteworthy that of all the news
papers published in Chicago only one
| supports Mr. Bryan, but I ought to add
that a considerable number of ; individual
journalists with whom I have spoken are
supporters of Mr. Bryan. It is very diffi
cult fora stranger to form a correct opin
ion in the clash of argument and asser
tion, but it seems certain that in Chicago,
as in New YorK, those who have anything
to lose are for sound money.
"Socialism, anarchy and , the .threat to
pack the Supreme Court frightens the
property class quite as much as free silver;
but they are two-edged. They attract a
large proportion of the laborers, while
they unite capitalists. For instance, I
hear of Southern planters who shrink from
supporting the Republicans, but who will
vote for Bryan and |who intend to give a
holiday on election day to their colored
voters so that they will vote for Mc-
Kinley."
IN THE REPUBLICAN COLUMS
Several JSorthem and Western State* That
Are Certain for McKinletj.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 23.â J. D. Elliott,
chairman of the South Dakota Republican
committee, made Chief Hahn of the
speakers' bureau feel happy to-day by the
receipt of a letter from him living a re
! same of the work' done by the Republicans
I in that State, and summing up the situa
| tion ihus:
"I am absofuteiy confident we shall
carry the Stale by at least 8000 majority,
and we shail control at least ninety mem
bers out of the 126 ia the Legislature. Not
a man in the State bas a dollar to bet
Bryan will carry South Dakota, and if
th -re was one there would be 500 to lake
him up. In Minnehaha County, the home
of Senator Pettigrew, there are sixty
speeches to be made this week and 120
assignments already for next week. I will
have a third poll of the State completed
I next Monday.' Over 6500 Republican
votes have been made in this State so far."
Commenting on the South Dakota situ
ation Mr. Hahn said it was demonstrated
tnat the Republicans of the State had de
cidea not 10 follow the leadership of Sena
tor Pettigrew. In July and August the
Populist committee claimed tbe electoral
vote of South Dakota sure for Bryan.
Committeeman Payne received reports
from the State executive committee of tbe
Republican League in California givine
the McKinley majority there at 15,000;
from Oregon, putting the Republican ma
jority at 2000 to 5000; and Minnesota say
ing the silver men had conceded that
Cloueh, for Governor, would not run more
than 15,000 behind McKinley, while the
Republicans c aimed he would not be
more than 10,000 votes in the rear.
The National Committee now claims
Michigan by 50,000 plurality. SpeaKers
from that State have come to headquar
ters within the last twenty-four Hours and
reported a radical change in sentiment on
the money question all over the State.
H. G. McMilian, chairman of the lowa
committee, came to headquarters for more
speakers and a conference with Mr.
Hanna, accompanied by Senator Allison.
Mr. McMillan reported every county in
the State had been polled anew and iound
to be satisfactory.

CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 23.â Chairman
Hanna read at his desk in the Republican
National headquarters this afternoon what
purported to be an : interview with ; Cam
paign Chairman Campau, of the Demo
cratic National Committee, in which he
makes , the charge that Mr. Hanna had
sent twenty men into Michigan to bribe
voters to abstain from going :;to; the polls;
that Mr. Campu had the names of most of
the agents who were under 'surveillance,
and that the man who sent them would
be punished. Mr. Hanna replied:
"My reply to that is that Mr. Campau
must produce the proof -or the charge be
makes against me or stand a self-convicted
li r before the American people. He is a
liar if he said that."
Mr. Campau was interviewed at Demo
cratic headquarters. He did not stand by
the published interview in its Â» specific
parts, saying: "There are some cl rical
errors in that statement. What I want to
say is that I have received reliable infor
mation that the Republicans have sent
twenty-seven men into Michigan to do
peculiar work. I have taken hold of the
thing, and am following it up closely. We

EX-SPEAKER CRISP
PAST ALL PAIN
Death of the Statesman
After a Lingering
Illness.
Paroxysms of the Heart Precede
the Struggle Before Fical
D.ssolution.
GEORGIA WILL MOURN THE LOSS
Distinguished Career of the S.utbern
Leader as a Soldier, Jurist and
Congressman.
ATLANTA, Ga., Oct. 23â Hon. Charles
Frederick Crisp, Speaker of the Fifty-first
and Fifty-second Congresses, died at
Holmes' Sanitarium here at 1:45 o'clock
this afternoon. A paroxysm of pain in
the heart preceded death, the paroxysm
probably resulting from a rupture of the
heart as the result of fatty degeneration.
Judge Crisp came to Atlanta six weeks
ago for treatment. He was then suffering
The Late CHARLES FREDERICK CRISP, Ex-Speaker of the
House of Representatives*
from a case of malarial fever which bad
developed in his home at Americus. He
spent June, July and a part of August in
tbe mountains of North Carolina and Ten
nessee. His return to Middle Georgia
during the very hottest period of the sum
mer developed the fever. After a week's
treatment by Doctors Holmes and Davis
the fever disappeared and the Judge im
proved slowly.
Last week be was out driving several
times and he was getting stronger, when
Sunday night he was attacked with symp
toms of his old trouble, pneumonia. Dr.
J. S. Todd was called in, and on Tuesday
congestion of the lungs disappeared, but
the patient was so weak tnat Mrs. Crisp
telegraphed for her children and all came
next day.
On Wednesday morning Judge Crisp's
condition improved, but he received no
callers. His family was hopeful until 10
o'clock last nieht, when he had a
paroxysm of pain near the heart. At
midnieht there was another paroxysm
and they continued at intervals all
through the night ana forenoon. He
suffered intensely, but was conscious up
to the very last. The last attack occurred
at 1:40, Judge Crisp dying rive minutes
later surrounded Dy his family.
Governoi Atkinson was his last visitor,
having called on Sunday, when he and
tbe Judge chatted for an hour on current
topics. Judge Crisp was keenly interested
in politics to the very last. He opposed
fusion with the Populists and charged
Governor Atkin-on to defeat it if possible
in Georgia.
Judge Crisp was one of the leaders of
the silver movement in Georgia, and on
that issne the State overwhelmingly in
dorsed him for the (Senate, to which he
would have been elected by the Legisla
ture, which meets next Wednesday.
There would have been practically no
opposition to him for the Senate. His
death at this time complicates the situa
tion and will lead to a bitter fight for the
senator-hip. Perhaps other offices will
be involved too.
The funeral arrangements have not been
completed, but the body will He in state
at the Capitol to-morrow and addresses
wili be delivered by Governor Atkinson
and members of the Georgia Congressional
delegation.
Tne announcement of Judge Crisp's
death was telegrap iea to Speaker
Thomas B. Heed and to the tergeant-at
arms of tbe House this afternoon, it
being customary to notify these officials
of the death of any member of the House
during recess in order that the proper
Congressional escort may be appointed.
Up to a late hour io-night no response
had been received from either of these
gentlemen.
Many telegrams of sympathy were re
ceived by Mrs. Crisp from prominent per
sons. Secretary Lamont was one of the
first to send a message.
At 10:30 o'clock to-morrow the Gov
ernor, city and county officers, members
elect of the General Assembly, members of
the Atlanta bar and prominent citizens
and militia officers will escort the body
from the sanitarium to the Capitol, in
which the remains will be placed.
Early Sunday morning the body with a
large escort will leave for Americus, going
by way of Macon. Upon arriving there
the remains will be placed in the Metho
dist bhurch and lie in slate for two hours,
when General Clement A. Evans will con
duct the last exercises.
Charles Frederick Cri-<p of Americus,
Ga., was born on the 29; h of January, 1845,
in Stieffield, England, where his parents
bad cone on a visit The child was
brought to this country th? year of his

He started in as a liputenant in Company
X, Tenth Virginia Infantry, and served
with that regiment until May 12, 1864,
when he was captured and became a pris
oner of war. He wan released from Fort
Delaware in June, 1865.
After the war he studied law in Ameri
cus, and after a tew months of intense ap
plication he was admittea to tue bar. In
casting about for a place to practice law
he settled in the little town of Ellaville,
Ga. He soon tired of bis limited country
practice, however, and began to mix in
politics. As the result of his efforts he
managed to get the appointment of Solici
tor-General of the southwestern judicial
circuit. This lasted lor a year. In 1873
he was reappointed for four years. He
then located in Americus.
In June, 1877, he was -appointed Judge
of the Superior Court, and in 1878 he was
elected by the General Assembly to the
same office. In 1880 he was nominated for
Judge, and after a hot election was in
stalled in that office tor four years. In
1882 he resigned from the bench to accept
the Democratic nomination for Congress,
In April, 1883, he was made permanent
president of tbs Democratic convention,
which assembled in Atlanta.
He was elected to theForty-eighth,Forty
ninth, Fiftieh, Fifty-first and Fifty-second
Congr sses. He was Speaker of the House
from 1893 to 1895. His present term would
have finished March 4, 1897.
DENOUNCED BY SEYMOUR.
The Episcopal Bishop Has Ho Use Jor
the Chicago Platform.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 23.â The Right
Rev. George F. Seymour, Bishop of the
Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Spring
field, wrote an open letter as a citizen,
such as Archbishop Ireland did, and the
National Democratic party's committee

nounces the free coinage of silver, declar
ing it "strikes at the National honor and
our commercial integrity as a people and
threatens with a prospect of serious injury
and embarrassment ail classes of the coir
munity, involving the suffering poor ana
rich alike."
He denounces the Supreme Court plank
of the Chicago platform as a "blow at the
most precious creation of the constitu

as bad as aiming a bullet at the llae of our

Hs also denounces the arraying of class

He has not voted since.

Robbery.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 23.â Chicago
and Alton westbound train No. 48 due
here at 6:50 P. m. was held up two
miles east of Independence just before
dark to-night by four masked men. They
cut the engine louse, compelled the ex
press messenger to opea the express car
and secured three packages of jewelry and
about $300. Tne rough sate was not
opened. None of the passengers were mo
lested.
The bandits drove the engine two miles
and took to the woods just before reaching
Independence. The holdup occurred in
Blue Cut, which has been the scene oi two
previous robberies by the James boys.
Tbe train was brought into Kansas City
at 8:45 p.m. Not a shot was fired and no
one was hurt.
The train was in charge of Conductor A.
J. Fell and Engineer James Wei ton. At
the entrance to Blue Cut it was nagged.
Welton reversed his engine and brought
the train to a standstill in the middle of
the cut. It was pitch dark. He looked
out from his cob to axcertain the trouble
when a gruff, voice commanded him to
get out of the cab and be quick about it.
Welton looked into the muzzle of a shot
gun and obeyed. Fireman Post did like
wise. Two more men emerged from the
darkness and mounted the engine. One
of them picked up tue fireman's coal pick.
Engineer and fireman were marched 10
the express car. Messenger Andy shields
was commanded to open. He at first
refused, but finally complied when con
vinced that Post's life was in danger.
The bandits entered the car, rifled the
money packages and secured $300 and a
quantity of jewelry.
The holdup occupied altogether about
five minutes. The passengers knew noth
ing of it until long after the engine had
disappeared. Conductor Fell describes
the men as being short aad heavy, wit a
dark hair. Their faces were masked.
They carried shotguns and revolvers.
Inspector Fiahive and eight picked men
left Kansas City on a special train im
mediately after the report of the robbery
reached here. The robbers are supposed
to be railroad men from the fact that they
knew how to handle the engine.

significance than appears on the face of it.
Long ago" the native ;or negro , population
became so reduced in numbers that to
save the sugar industry from ; collapse ; a
treaty was entered into with the Indian
Government for the immigration of coolie
laborers from that distant but sister de
pendency of the British crown. The sys

rison was removed from Guiana, and the
police, 500 strong, were armed and drilled.
When the troops were withdrawn some of
the local papers expressed the fear that it
was an unwise move owing to the enor
mous Indian populationâ upward of from
80.000 to 90,000. V ' V "
/ When the sugar crisis came the Deme
rara planters decided to reduce the labor

a general strike was tbe immediate result.
Rioting ensued all along the line ot the
plantations, and day before yesterday it
culminated in an armed demonstration on
the Nonpareil estate near Georgetown.

BRINGS OFFERS
OF SETTLEMENT
The Return of Sir Julian
Pauncefote to the
Capital.
Probable Provisos by Which
England Expects to Estab
lish Boundaries.
VEKEZUELA'3 CLAIMS RIGHTED
Territory Now Occupied by British
Subjects May Be Tranierred to
Venezuelan Sovereignty.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Oct 23.â The
British Embassador, Sir Julian Paunce
forte, has lost no time after bis long ab
sence in London on resuming bis diplo
matic functions in Washington. Within
twenty-four hours of his return he had a
short interview with the Secretary of
State, after which Sir Julian called at the
executive mansion and left his card for
the President
It was stated authoritatively that Sir
Julian's call to-day was merely one of
courtesy and that to some time in the
near future was left the formal confer
ences, which it is hoped on both sides will
result in the settlement of the Venezuelan
controversy. Subsequent to the visit,
however, Sir Julian sent a bundle of
papers from the embassy to the Secretary,
including the long-sought list ot bona
ride colonists who had settled in the dis
puted territory previous to January 1,
1887, together with a description of their
holdings and the character of improve
ments they had made.
These settlements constituted substan
tially the only point of difference between
Lord Salisbury and Secretary Oiney when
the summer vacation interrupted the ne
gotiations, and tne forthcoming confer
ences are to be practically confined to
these points.
Lord Salisbury^ proviso was that the
boundary line to be drawn by tne pro
posed arbitration tribunal of three was
not to include as the territory of Vene
zuela any territory which was bona fiJe
occupied by the subjects of Great Britain
on the Ist of January, 1887. or as territory
of Great Britain any territory bona fide
occupied by Venezuelans at the same
date.
Secretary Olney's counter proposition of
June 12, which Sir Vernon Harconrt sub
sequently referred to in Parliament and
commended as the solution of the diffi
culty, was that either Lord- Salisbury's
proviso should be stricken out altogether,
or there might be substituted for it the
following, "provided, however, that in fix
ing such line, if territory of one party be
found in the occupation of the subjects or
citizens of tbe other party such weight and
effect shall be given to such occupation as
reason, justice, tbe rules of international
law and the equities of the particular case
may appear to require."
It is stated that the revised suggestion
upon which Great Britain look* to a
speedy conclusion of the negotiations
deals with a plan to affirm the titles of in
dividuals to the property they have ac
quired in case the contemplated boundary
tribunal decides to change the present
dominion of the "settled districts" by
awarding the territory now occupied by
British subjects to Venezuelan sov
ereignty. The extreme aversion which
Lord Salisbury bas exhibited to a possi
bility of these settlers being surrendered
to the Jaw and domination of Venezuela
led to the suggestion that England would
co-operate in establishing an independent
republic of Guiana, comprising all of the
disputed territory.
Tbe limits within which England might,
consent to make an agreement for full
arbitration would include a stipula
tion that the settlers shall not be dis
turbed and that their possessions shall be
guaranteed to them.
Secretary Olney's counter proposition
under this head is declared to be too in
definite, and a specific provision of pei
manency ia insisted upon. The earlier
suggestion of England that in case of an
adverse decision of her claim she should
have tbe right to purchase these settled
districts, is stated to nave been firmly de
clined by Venezuela, with the concurrence
of the Unitea States.

Consumption Hnds the Zife of a San
Francisco Business .Van.
PASADENA, Cal., Oct. 23. â J. A.
Cloutier, a former resident of San Fran
cisco, whose place of business was 121 Mar
ket street, died here yesterday under pecu
liarly sad circumstances. He was a victim
of consumption and had been here several
months. Recently he was removed from
a hotel to a vacant bouse on the outskirts
of town, where be was cared for by a
nurse, but was without near friends or
relatives. Cloutier was formerly con
nected with the Pacific Pine Lumber
Company, San Francisco. He was buried

An Advance in Tea.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct 23.â Reports from
New York of a rise in the tea market are
borne out in the Chicago field. When
asked about the matter yesterday, A. P.
Upham, the buyer for Sprague, Warner &
Co., said: "It is true that there has been
a general advance iothe tea market owing
to the short crop in China and Japan. As
to the statement that there is tea enough
in the United States to carry the market
for a year, that is pure speculation, ana I
am inclined to say it is not true."

Golden Gate Union came over by special

SANTA BARBARA ROMANCE
Bigamy Unwittingly Committed
by a Pretty Young
Woman.
Learns After WeddiDg a Second
Time That Her First Husband
Lives.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct 23.â A
pretty, brown-eyed woman in Santa Bar
bara, with a tiny b.iby boy resting in her
arms and a seven-year-old daughter by
her side, is startled by tbe news that the
husband she had long supposed dead is
alive and well and will shortly appear in
Santa Barbara to claim his child and to
challenge the legality of bis wife's second
marriage.
Eight years ago Antonio Botillier was
married to Matilda Zurmuhlen, the
daughter of respectable parents who re
side here. Tbe marriage was far from be
ing a happy one. Botillier was intemper
ate and improvident acd in his drunken
fits is said to have frequently beat his wife
over the head with empty bottles acd
with his abuse and evil temper made her
life a torment to her. She patiently bore
with him and two years ago, when tbe
miracles of the Keeley cure were under
discussion, permitted him to mortgage
their little home for $150 and with tbe
funds thus raised to go to the institute at
Ontario in Southern California.
Several weeks later came the news that
Botillier had mysteriously disappeared
from that place. Some time afterward a
bleaching skeleton was lound in a canyon
adjoining the institute grounds, and with
it all that was supposed to be mortal of
Antonio BotiJliT was supposed to be de
cently put under ground. It is small
marvel that trie ynung widow's grief was
mild and short lived. A little later she
married a young farmer "named Coates,
and in a happy home, with a little son as
the product of this union, she had well
nigh forgotten the sorrows of tbe past.
Now come the tidings that Antvtnio Bo
tillier is in San Diego; that be ran away
from the gold cure institute, deserting
wife and child, and has since been herding
cattle in Texas.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1896.
BRYAN'S POLICY
OF RULE OR RUIN
Secretary of the Interior
Francis Scores the
Nebraskan.
Says the Welfare of the Country
Is Imperiled by the
Orator.
ANARCHY MUST NOT PREVAIL.
No Man Who Desires Law and Order
Can Indorse the Chicago
Platform.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 23. -In re
ply to the invitation of Attorney-General
Walker of Missouri to deliver speeches in
that State, Secretary of tne Interior Fran
cis has written a letter, in which, after
expressing regret that official duties pre
vented an acceptance, he says:
This is a time, however, when no man can
afford to remain silent. The welfare of the
country is imperiled; the perpetuity of the
Republic is at stake. I believe the sober sec
ond thought of tbe people will condemn and
repudiate those who are trying to array
classes against each other and incite the dis
contented to violHtions of obligations, if not
to lawlessness. And I <!eny that those of
us who raise a voice aeainst such teachings
Hnd protest against the revered name of
Democracy being used for ends so baÃe have
departed from the fÂ«ith or have weakened in
devotion to the great principles of govern
ment by the people.
If the organization calling Itself the regular
Democracy be successlni at the coming
election, commercial disaster, finnncial
misery, social discontent, National dishonor
would ensue, and the party responsible for
such conditions would be cursed by an out
raged people for a generation to come.
A list of the prominent Democrats throueb
ont the country who decline to support Mr.
Bryan and his platform would embrace nearly
all the Democratic leaders of this generation.
Those who have led us in past contests and
who are now enlisted under the banner are
giving him but lukewarm or perfunctory sup
port. You should not be surprised thereat, as
he, intoxicated with the belief of divinity of
n ls oÂ«n mission, or blinded by his own con
ceit, pays no credit to their councils, puts no
value on their wisdom or experience. His
convictions are Populistic.
He bus been preaching the tenets of the party
for months or years past. He voted the Popu
list ticket at the last Presidential election.
He is the nominee of tnat party for President,
and its loaders aver that he would have been
their standard-bearer whether the Chicago
convention would have nominated him or not.
He announced before that convention was
held that he would not support its nominee if
a free coinage plnnk, at tbe ratio of 16 to 1,
were not adopted, and has stated since the
convention that he would have bolted the
nomination ii the platform bad not so de
clared.
Mr. Bryan's friends had agreed npon a ruie
and ruin policy before the convention was
held. The bolt of the silver Republicans from
the St. Louis convention was an epoch fn their
plans, whicr>. in my judgment, contemplated
the nomination of Senator 11. M. Teller of
Colorado, a life-long uncompromising Repub
lican, by the Chicago convention.
It is not a Democratic electoral ticket we are
asked to vote for in Missouri; It is a fusion
ticket composed of Populists and Bryan Demo
crats.
Mr. Francis repudiates tbe Chicago plat
form in bitter words and praises Presi
dent Cleveland. He concludes:
I shall surely be at home to cast my vote for
Palmer nnd Buckner, and regret that I cannot
leave here in time to make several speeches in
Missouri.
LIFE AT CIRCLE CITY.
There Bread Se/ts for Twenty-Five Cents
a Loaf and Potatoes for Forty
Cents a Pound
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 23,â The follow
ing letter was received to-day from Mrs.
Wensel, a Tacoma woman living in Circle
City, Alaska:
Tbe stories told of trie great amount of gold
to be washed out here are unfounded. Alaska
contains much gold, but as yet th> country is
undeveloped. Much prospecting baa been
done and many rich digrines discovered, but
not enough to give employment to the many
men coming here.
Two-third* or more go away disappointed.
The trip to Circle City is a long and very hard
one, as well as expensive and dangerous. Rain
falis nearly all summer like the winter rains
on Puget Sound. Circle City- has only two or
three frame houses, all built of logs with moss
between. The winter weather is very cold, but
no winds blow. Last winter the thermometer
registered over 70 below, when outside work
was impossible. No one would think of com
ing here if be understood tbe situation. Many
miners and business men arc doing well, but
men who know say everything is overdone,
even the labor supply. Wooa sells at $10 and
$11 a cord, lumber at $45 a thousand, and the
market is short.
One might think It would pay to raftlogs
and wood down the river, but on account of
the many dangers and the character of the
work none but cxi erlenced log-drivers can do
it. Wagea are from $5 to $8 a day, but work
is scarce. Meals are 75 cents each and board
$50 a month. Fresh meat is served only when
a moose is brought in. Salmon is not very
plentiful this season. Nearly everytning in
the grocery line for sale here is canned. Ordi
nary canned goods are 50 to 75 cents a can.
evaporated potatoes 40 cents per pound and
Irish potatoes, when they can be had, $15 a
bushel. Jijrgs are $1 50 a dozen when in tne
market. BuÂ«ar is 25 cents a pound, flour $4 a
sack, butter Spl a Toll, wacntnbs $4 each, tin
water-buckets $2, clothespin* 25 cents a dozen.
Circle City has three restaurants aud four
stores, besides tbe Alaska Commercial Com
rmny'.s store ana sveral bakeries. Bread is
25 cents a loaf, or ii vf for $1. Dougbuuts are
50 cents a dozen, oil $1 a gallon. There are no
ministers and tnree doctors. The city boasts
of several laundries.
The Vukou fiats are 300 miles long. Circle
City is twelve miles from the north end of the
flats. The river Is vi-ry wide here and con
tains many islands. It is expected a mill will
be built on one island next year.
Santa Rosa Sporting News.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 23.â The result of

Mr. JicVeagh says: "We did not have oar

Santa Barbara Child- Injured.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 23.â
Virginia Corea, a two-year-old girl, whose
parents reside back of the Mission, strayed
into the stable-yard yesterday and toyed
with the tail of a spirited horse. The
animal kicked the little one in the fore
head. The baby crept to a bwing, seated
herself in it, tnen tottered to the house,
cried out that she was hurt and fell in a

Many Converts Made at a Meeting
A dressed by D* Lemos of

MONTEREY, Cal.. Oct. 23.â The great
est political rally in the history of Monte
rey was that in the opera-noose to-night
under the auspices of the McKinley and
Hobart Club. The speaking was in the
Portuguese language. From the enthusi
asm manifested it is safe to say that his
toric old Monterey will give a ia*ge ma
jority for sound nconey and protection.
Jacob R. Leese presided and introduced
A. M. Martin of Watsonville, who spoke
to the Portuguese voters in regard to the
duty they owed their chosen country to
support the nominees of the Republican
party. The speaker of the evening was
Hon. Francisco Ignacio de Lemos of Hay
wards, who held his audience for an hour
and a half, explaining the principles as
la:d down in the Republican platform.
The speaker has an eloquent de ivery,
combined with humor, and the audience
regretted when ne had finished his dis
course. In regard to the money question
he reminded his hearers that Portugal was
working under a gold standard.
The monetary unit there was the milreis,
its value in United States coin being $1 08.
The ratio of gold to silver was one to 14.08
of limited lender silver. A? a larce pro
portion of the Portuguese in the Eastern
Â£tateÂ» were factory employes, it was for
their benefit, he said, to vote for the party
wliich would not only cause the factory to
be reopened, but would erect others. The
.. speaker explained the fallacy of the fr^e
and unlimited coinage of silver idea and
showed his audience that as contracts
heretofore made payable in gold were to
be paid in that specie and as Con^res*
could not pass retroactive laws, -old
would flow nut of the country and c* jld
not be secured without a premium.
The meeting adjourned with rousing
cheers for McKinley and Hobart. Many
in the audience had been made converts
to the grand old party's principles.

The District Attorney Appeals Against
Sectional Agitation.
ONTARIO, Cal., Oct. 23.â The most
enthusiastic rally of the campaign was
held here last night, the occasion being
the appearance of W. 8. Barnes of San
Francisco. The McKinley marching club
engaged in a torchlight parade and fancy
drill, which was witnessed by a large
crowd of people. The hall van packed to
the doors when Mr. Barnes began his
address. He said:
"Did the Republican party decide to
open the gates of Castle Garden to the
pauper labor of foreign countries, or the
mints of this Nation to all the silver of the
world; did it declare that tbe salvation of
the people depended upon the free coinage
of silver; did it arrange class against class,
section against section and business
against business, then we would all say,
'Let the Republican party die.' But if
the Republican party stands for no North,
no South, no East, no West, but only' for
the protection of all the people, carrying
in the forefront the banner of a reunited
country, whose clinging folds wrap half
the world, over the best fed, the best
clothed people on earth, then we should
say: 'Long life to the Republican party,
and we shall be Republicans.' "
At the conclusion of Mr. Barnes' re
marks two beautiful silk bannes were
presented to the McKinley Marching Club
by the Republican ladies of Ontario.
LOS ANGELESS MEETINGS.

and Congressman McLarhlan.
LOS ANGELES, Cat.., Oct. 23.â Colonel
Albert de Leur of Wisconsin delivered an
able speech at Hazard's Pavilion this
evening to a large audience. Colonel de
Leur said that he had noted with special
interest a recent cablegram w red to a
Democratic newspaper urging the im
portance of Bryan's eleciion on the ground
that it would greatly benefit the European
farmer.
"Why," inquired the speaker, "were not
such words used in r lation to Major Mc-
Kinley's election ? Because those Counts
who framed that cablegram knew that it
is the business of the Republican candi
date and those who stand with him in tnis
campaign to look after the interests of the
American farmer â not tbe European."
Congressman McLacblan spoke in tbe
Republican ppr.abl*- tÂ»nt on Central ave
nue this evening. He had lately returned
from a tour of tbe Sixth Congressional
District, wherein he made speeches in
Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Louis Obispo,
Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, and
ne brings the best possible news in respect
to the campaign in these counties. The
speaker said that the disaffection from
the Democratic party was something amaz
ing all through his district. Moreover, he
observed that, within the past few days, a
splendid numDerof old-line Democrats had
come out for McKinley and sound money.

as "amendment number six," while
on tbe sample ballot it is designated
as "Assembly amendment number

COLFAX, Cal., Oct. 23.â People from
the surrounding country thronged to the
prosperous mining town of lowa Hill to
night to hear ex-Governor H. H. Mark
ham and Hon. Tirey L. Ford. The gen

NÂ«ff with a special conveyance. Soon
they entered on a nine-mile drive over a
rough mountain road to lowa Hill, fol
lowed by a large crowd, in which were
many women. All available teams were

who could not secure seats in the wagons
walked.

SANTA CRUZ Ht:MO.\BTRATIOX.
Congrestman JUaouire Talk* on ttifi
Pacific Road*' funding Bill.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., Oct. 23. â The
Democratic County Committee planned
well for to-night's Democratic rally.
Hon. James G. Maguire spoke in the
pavilion to 2500 persons. He was intro
duced by Lieutenant-Governor Jeter, and
went straight into the discussion of the
refunding bill. He said this bill would
cost the Government 5240,000.000 to repay
the . stealings of the Pacific railroads.
When he mentioned Congressman John
son's name, hisses were heard. These
monopolies, be said, should be subor
dinated to the law, and meet their obliga
tions as private citizens. The course of
the Southern Pacific Railroad was one of
crime and the refunding bill was a bill
seeking by legalized means to compound
a felony.
Maguire favored a bill limiting the
powers of the Federal courts. He de
nounced "Government by injunction."
Passing to the tariff question, he dis
missed it with the remark that it is not
worthy of argument in this campaign.
The free and unlimited coinage of silver
was the Mint, he said. Silver was the
poor man's money and gold represented
McKinley, Wall street and Mark Hanna.
The main point of Congressman M ay ire's
speech was a eulogy of William J. Bryan.

Kinley Hall to-night. A number of the
leading men of the city acted as vice
presidents. General Chipman was the
first speaker. He gave an exhaustive re
view of the financial history of the coun
try, and the present Democratic policy of
repudiation and dishonor was shown upin
clear colors. He was enthusiastically ap
plauded.
Judge Campbell devoted his time to a
general discussion of present issues, utter
ine patriotic sentiments that caught his
audience and carried it along with creat
outbursts of applause. At ibe close of the
meeting three cheers were given for Mc-
Kinley. Hobart and liberty, when pro
posed by Judge Campbell, waving a hand
kerchief.
The sentiment here is conceded to be
daily erowinc stronger for McKinley ana
sound money. San Diego no longer rests
under the disadvantage of being a strong
hold of repudiationists.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1896.
SHASTA COUNTY'S
ENORMOUS LOSS
Treasurer Jackson's Thefts
Much Greater Than
Reported.
Believed to Have Robbed the
People's Vaults of Ntarly
$100,000.
ARRESTED AND IMPRISONED.
The Defaulter Piaced Under Heavy
Bail, Which He Is Unable to
Advance.
REDDING, Cal., Oct. 23.â The begin
ning of tbe end in the affairs of William
Jackson, Shasta County's defaulting
Treasurer, was witnessed thin evening and
to-night the embezzling Treasurer occu
pies a cell in the county prison.
Wnen Jackson's shortage was exposed
by his concocted story to the effect that a
robbery of the treasury nad be9n at
tempted and that he was quite seriously
hurt in the encounter with the robbers
his bondsmen began an investigation and,
at a casual inspection of the bookb and ac
counts placed the deficiency at $27,000.
This afternoon tbe report of the expert
hired to examine the boots brought Jack
son's shortage up to such an alarming
figure that hi-* bondsmen became uneasy.
As the books and report now stand
Jackson is an embezzler to the extent of
$40,000 and it is believed that amount will
reach $60,000 and perhaps $100,000 by the
end of the week, when the expert's report
will have been completed. The embezzling
had been going on for ten years past and
Jackson had been enjoying the confidence
of tbe people and at the same time spend
ing their money. Beginning with the
$27,000 shortage of a month ago, each day
the expert has found some new amount
missing.
To-night County Clerk Drynan swore to
a complaint for tbe arrest of Jackson.
The paper was placed in the hands of an
officer and twenty minutes thereafter
Jackson was lodged in the County Jail.
Anticipating such a move and believing
he would have a chance to get off on bail
the defaulting Treasurer had previously
arranged with a couple of local capitalists
to go is bail to the extent of $20,000, he
considering that amount would be as
much as tbe magistrate would ask, but
to-night, when he appeared before Judge
Gardner, the bail was fixed at $40,000.
The prisoner's face wore a downcast look,
and all hopes of freedom were lost to him.
Not being able to get that amount of
security he wan compelled to go to jail,
where he will remain until his case is
disposed of.
JOHN W. FOSTER IS HERE
Is on His Way to the Orient
on a Delicate Diplomatic
Mission.
Has Been Minister to Many Countries
and Is an Authority on Inter
national Law.
Hon. John W. Foster of Indiana, who
negotiated the treaty between China and
Japan at the close of the recent war, ar
rived here last night, accompanied by
HON. JOHN W. FOSTER, Who Negotiated the Treaty Between
Japan and China, and Is Now Bound to the Orient on a
Diplomatic Mission*
Mrs. Foster, from Washington, D. C, and
is at the Palace. The train on which he
came was two hours late.
Mr. Foster is on his way to Hawaii,
Japan and China. It has been hitherto
announced that be was going to Hawaii
on a delicate diplomatic mission, but it is
now stated that his real mission concerns
only Japan and China. It being late Mr.
Foster declined to go into any details, ex
cept to somewhat humorously say he no
ticed one of the papers said be was going
on a diplomatic trip to the Hawaiian
Islands.
He will sail on the Hongkong and
Nagasaki steamer Peru Monday.
Mr. Foster is said to receive $20,000 a
year from the Chinese Government, nnd
he has at different times been employed
by Mexico, Belgium and other countries.
For many years he has given close Atten
tion to questions of international law,
practicing at Washington. In this he has
world-wide distinction. It is said that for
many he has made far more money
each year than the President of the United
States.
He was appointed Minister to Mexico in
1873 oy Presideut Grant; was reappointed
by President Hayes, and before his term
expired was transferred to Russia as Min- '
istÂ«r. President Arthur appointed him
afterward as Minister to Spain. He served
three years ana resigned, returned home
and negotiated an important commercial
treaty with Spain. Tde Senate opposed it,
and President Cleveland withdrew it for
farther considerut on. Later Mr. Foster
went to Spain in the interest of a modified
treaty.
For his services as a diplomat in the in
terest of China in reduclnp the indemnity
desired by Japan he received, it is said, a
fortune in itself.
He served in the War of the Rebellion,
and for a time afterward was editor of the
Evansville (Indiana) Journal. He is 60
years old.

The following letter has been received for
publication :
Editor Callâ Dkar Sib: Having seen a state
ment in the Examiner this morning that a
ratification meeting waa to be held at Union
Hall this evening and that the past president
of International Bricklayers' Union No. 1,
which is composed of about twelve members,
is to preside, and half of that membership are
ex-members of our union who were expelled
for violating tbe laws of constitution, x wish it
understood by all union men of the different
trades onions that this International Brick

San Francisco Bricklayers' Association, which
has a memberohip of 250 and has been organ
ized since 1882. Sincerely \ ours,

RAILROADERS ARE SOLID
Grand Master Sargent ot the
Engineers Say They Favor
McKinley.
They Kacw He Will Bring Perma
nent Prosperity by Starting
th Mills.
Grand Matter F. P. Sargent of tbe
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen of
the United States, whose home is in
Peoria, 111., arrived here last night. Mr.
Sargent left Illinois a week ago and came
to the coast by way of New Mexico and
Arizona.
He has come, be says, for the purpose of
conferring with representatives of the
brotherhood on the Pacific coast on mat
tern of interest to the organization. This
visit, however, he says is not of a politi
cal nature, as his position would preclude
anything of that kind.
"I may say, however," he said, "that 1
am perxonally in favor of the election of
Mr. McKinley, and think there is no ques
tion but the majority of the railway men
are throughout the country. They believe
that with Mr. McKinley as President con
fidence would be restored and the coun
try would soon be put on a good dv siness
basis.
"Everywhere I have arone thus far I have
noticed intense interest in tbe election.
In Illinois the interest on both sides is
tense. I was in Chicago a week ago, and
the estimates I heard there were 40,000 to
80,000 as a majority for McKinley.
"From what I see I believe a larger vote
will be polled this year than has ever be
fore been known in tbe United States.
Every place men are discussing the issues.
And they want facts. They will not listen
to average .fourth of July speaking or the
waving of the bloody shirt.
"The result has been thus far that men
are better posted on the financial question
than at any time hitherto. They have
looked into tbe merits of tne question. I
have no doubt that many men who would
ordinarily vote for free silver cannot do so
because of the planks looking toward
anarchy in the Democratic platform. I
hava heard many men say so. They feel
that they cannot trust men like Tillman
and others who are foremost in the sup
pott o; Mr. Bryan. They fear what might
result if such men were put in prominent
positions. Therefore, they will vote for
McKinley.
"Farmers want to know what they will
get for their grain; woo! men want to
know that they will get a livin > price for
wool, and everybody wants solid business
and prosperity.
"I met a wool-buyer at Trinidad who
told me ne expected to buy wool for 4
cents a pound. Last year, as he said, ne
was paying 17 and 18 cents, and be would
rather pay it now than to pay 4 cents.
"I was surprised as 1 came West to find
bow many railroad men there were for
McKinley. Nearly every one I saw was
for him. In fact, among all classes I have
found many more McKinley men than I
expected. This was very gratifying to
me."
Mr. Sargent will be here five or six days
and will return by way of the Central Pa
cific. He is at the Lick.
D. A. Macdonald Club.
The regular meeting of the D. A. Macdonald
Club was held at its clubrooms, corner of Fif
teenth and Mission streets, last night, Presi
dent Dr. W. D. McCarthy presiding. J. J. Mc-
Convllle, the nominee of the Anti-Charter
Democratic party, addressed tne meeting.

STAGE HOLDUPS
IN RED CANYON
New Mexico Bandits Defy
the Law and Its
Minions.
Two Coaches Running Frcm San
Antonio to White Oaks
Disappear.
R3IGN OF AN OUTLAW BAND
Baffles tbe S arch of Posses Sent to
tbe Mountains in Its
Pursuit
SAN ANTONIO, N. M., Oct. 23.-Keeper
Rice of Mountain Station, on the stage
road to White Oaks, arrived on horseback
to-night with the news that the men who
held up the stagecoach in the Oscure
Mountains a few weeks ago are still in the
hills and that they have in all probability
held up two coaches within the past few
days, as the Wednesday and Thursday
stages are not yet in. Red Canyon is in
fested with armed men, who are lying in
wait for the San Antonio mail.
Rice came out on the road to warn the
driver and to seek assistance.
When the stages did not put in an ap
pearance yesterday he sent a man out to
look for them. The messenger while en
tering the dreary canyon was confronted
by two masked men, armed to the teetb,
and turning bis horse fled for his life.
The men were in wait for the coach from
this point, undoubtedly.
These men compose a part of the band
of robbers which held up the Atlantic and
Pacific express a few weeks ago, when
their leader was shot. Posses have been
scouring tne mountains for them. An
other will start from here in the morning.
NEILSEN CRIES FRAUD,
Claims His Wife's Divorce Suit
Is the Outcome of a
Conspiracy.
William M. Neilsen was yesterday be
fore Judge Daingerfield on an order to
show cause why he should not pay his
wife alimony pending trial of her suit for
divorce.
After reciting that he earns but $12 per
week Neilsen filed an affidavit claiming
that his wife is possessed of a separate es
tate worth over $10,000, and that she is in
no need of maintenance.
For a separate answer to his wife's
charges of cruelty and habitual intemper
ance the defendant says that Mrs. Neiisen
is in tbe habit of consuming large quan
tities of chloral hydrate, "a most stupefy
ing and brain-destroying drug," and of
indulging to excess in "corner-grocery
wine." He claims that the wrongs she al
leges are hallucinations caused by the uÂ«e
of the stimulants, and that Clara A. Me-
Farland, his wife's sister, furnishes the
drugs to the plaintiff. The whole pro
ceeding, be says, is the result of a con
spiracy formed between Mrs. McFarland
and his wife's attorney, though what is
the object of the combination he neglects
to state.
The matter was continued until Friday
next for further hearing.
TWO LEPERS ESCAPE
The Bindt Brothers Leave the Pest
house to Escape the City and
County Hospital.
The health authorities are much exer
cised over the sudden and unauthorized
departure from tne Pesthouse of Frank
and Ernest Bindt, two of tne lepers who
have been confined at the public hospital.
Ever since the order recently made by
the Board of Health condemning the
Pesthouse came to the ears of the inmates
there has been dissatisfaction, the lepers
preferring to put up witn the poor accom
modations of their present residence
rather than to be exposed to the public
gaze at the City and County Hospital. No
serious trouble was anticipated, however,
until Thursday evening, when the Bindt
brothers were missed.
At 10 o'clock, on entering their room,
Superintendent Keating saw that they
were not on hand, and the finding of a
note in the apartment confirmed his sus
picion that they had escaped. The mis
sive left stated that they did not propose
to be removed to the City and County
Hospital and that they had rather face
the chances of making a living outside
than be removed. As both are so little
marked by the dread disease as to defy
detection by any except experts it is not
thought likely that they will be found.
The police have been notified of the escape
and asked to be on the lookout for the
men. _
THE VICTOR CANTON.
It Brings Home Its Prize Drill Trophy
From thÂ« Santa Craz Encampment.
The home-coming of the canton of
San Francisco No. 5, L O. O. F., from
the Santa Cruz encampment last evening
was a triumphant one, as the knights
brought their newly won drill trophy with
them. The canton, under command of
General E. H. Black, Lieutenant W. 8.
Potter and Ensign J. Thompson, left
Santa Cruz in the afternoon, after giving
three cheers for the seaside city that had
treated it so royally, and The Call, whose
reports of the encampment were so ac
curate. Upon reaching here It marched
up Market street in that splendid mili
tary form that made it the victor at Santa
Cruz. The column of knights halted at
the office of The Call, where they exhib
ited the beautiiul $500 jeweled silvei urn
resting on its pedestal of ebony.
li was won by the Sacramento canton
last year, and is now the prize of the Ban
Francisco knights. If they hold it in tbe
comDetitive drills of '97 and '98 it will
be theirs forever. Santa Rosa Canton
holds the former trophy, having won it in
three consecutive encampments.
HELD TO ANSWER.
J. A. Mitchell, thn slayer of K. T. Hicks,
Most Stand Trial.
Judge Joachimsen has held J. A.
Mitchell to answer before the Superior
Court on a charge of murder, bail being
denied. Mitchell is the attorney who
rpcently shot and killed Private Detective
E. T. Hicks in the Spreckels building.
No evidence was put forth by the defense
and the prosecution simply presented the
same evidence as given at the inquest.

*"OB VICF-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Get ready for the grand parade.
Let us show Tom Reed what Ban Fran
cisco can do.
Don't forget that tbe big date is Satur
day, October 31.
Scratch the free-silver Bryanite and you
vrill find the free-trader.
All Republicans should be in line for the
closing rally of the campaign.
The ovation to Reed will be a brilliant
preliminary to the triumph of McKinley.
Everything is coming our way in the
East and we must carry the West forward
to meet it. I
Republican enthusiasm is tbe motive
power that moves the tidal wave, and it is
rising every day.
Colonel Taylor has been tried in office
and proven true. When you vote for him
you are running no risk.
Tbe agrarian agitators may not mean
cnarchy, but their words sound like it and
their actions tend that way.
Show your colors, assert your convic
tions, make yourself count as a factor in
the battle against the agitators.
Every industry in San Francisco should
take part in the great procession of tbe
champions ol protection to industry.
The Sunday Call of to-morrow wiil con
tain the very reading you will like most.
Leave orders for it to-day and be sure of
getting it
When the Popocrats see tbe size and
hear the shouts of the big parade they
will think coercion has come after them
sure enough.
From now until election day the plain
duty of loyal Republicans is to work for
the party ticket, tbe whole ticket and
nothing but the ticket.
Now is the time for eood citizens to
unite and overwhelm the agitators. Let
us put an end to Bryanism in politics for
the rest of this generation.
Keep the regular Republican ticket to
the front in the municipal campaign.
Work for Colonel Taylor and make sure
of a good government for the City.
Now is the time for Republican loyalty
to prove its virtue and its worth. Now is
the time for every stalwart to stand by the
party organization and fight its foes to a
finish.
Conservative Democrats will have an
honored place in the ranks of the parade
of the friends of pood government. They
are right on this issue, and have a right to
make it known.
The Populists may think they have
swallowed the Democracy, but the Palmer
and Buckngr stalwarts will show them
they have pot hold of nothing but the ragr,
tag and bobtail of the party.
On the occasion of the Republican
demonstration at the close of the campaign
every building along the line of march
should be decorated as if for a festival to
celebrate returning prosperity.
Four years ago Cleveland was as eager
as anybody to array labor against capi'al
end to appeal to prejudice and ignorance,
but in his Princeton speech on Thursday
he spoke up like a man against that
system of campaigning, so it seems he is
â wiser going out of office than be was when
he wished to get in.
Professional men, bankers, business
men, merchants, manufacturers and worfc
ingmen of every trade and industry
should take an active part in the work of
the closing days of the campaign. Where
every man's interest is at stake every
man owes it to himself and to the com
munity to be resolute in maintaining it.
The attempt of tbe Popocrats in Ken
tucky to hoot down Secretary Carlisle and
prevent him from speaking in that State
is not without its usefulness in the cam
paign. It shows the temper and charac
ter of the men who are supporting Bryan,
and will open the eyes of many a sound,
conservative, law loving Democrat to the
real purpose of the Bryanite movement.
Emblems of sound money, protection
and prosperity; banners that biazon the
cause of law and order, and above all, the
starry flag of the Nation and of popular
patriotism should be displayed all along
our streets on the closing day of tne cam
paign in order that even the most doubt
ing may know that tbe people of San
Frnnciseo will vote on election day by an
overwhelming majority for National pros
perity and National honor.
A REPUBLICAN MAYOR.
The regular Republican nominee for
Mayor of San Francisco is Hon. C. L.
Taylor, whose portrait occupies the first
page of t The Call to-day. If the posses
sion of a spotless character a3 a private
citizen and of a splendid Â»record as a pub
lic official counts 5 for anything. Colonel
Taylor will be the next Mayor of this City
as surely as the sun rises on the third day
of November.
The "problem of municipal government
becomes easy of solution when the people
of a great city adopt and carry into prac
tice the simple rule of honoring those who
serve them faithfully in one position
by elevating them to another, which they
have been proven competent to Colonel
Taylor as a Supervisor has been found
faithful in the performance of every duty
which That office requires. During the
past two years \ the most captious and
critical citizen has been unable to find a
single flaw in the record of his official
service. Alert, intelligent, untiring and
incorruptible he has earned the utmost
respect and confidence, which the people
of San Francisco could \ bestow upon a
public servant who has performed the full
measure of his duty with fidelity and zeal.
The office of Supervisor is the natural
stepping-stone to that of Mayor, and the
man who has honestly and properly per
formed the duties of the one should have
the public support in his aspiration to the
other.
The Republicans of San Francisco
should inform themselves rightly upon the
matter of its mayoralty ana make no mis
take in the person whom they will elevate
to that office upon election day.
Colonel C. L. Taylor is the regular Re- .
publican nominee for Mayor of San Fran
cisco. There is no other Republican nom
inee for that office, nor is there any other
person aspiring thereto who has an equal
claim upon the public confidence and
support.
If th 9 people of this City are earnestly
desirous of placing at the head of its gov
ernment a Mayor under whose honest and
experienced eye every interest will be safe
and its every department be administered
with the utmost prudence and economy
and utility which it is possible for its chief
magistrate to compel f they will: elect
Colonel C. L. Taylor to the office of Mayor
of San Francisco on the third day of No
vember. -'-â â¢â

A GRAND DEMONSTRATION.
The grand parade of Republicans which
is to take place in this City on Saturday,
October 31, will serve the double purpose
of closing the campaign with a great rally
for McKinley and Hobart and of giving a
Californian welcome to Speaker Reed. It
is an occasion which should be made
memorable in the history of the City and,
under the able management of the State
Central Committee, there is little doubt
that this will be accomplished.
The committee, however, should have
ample support from the people. The oc
casion should be taken advantage of to
make a grand demonstration of National
patriotism on the part of all law-abiding
citizens. Conservative Democrats need
not hesitate to join their former Republi
can foes in tbe procession that will march
through the streets on that day. Business
men and workingmen, whatever may
have been their former political affilia
tions, may well combine to make the
demonstration one of patriotic as well as
of partisan meaning.
There should not be less than 50,000
people in the procession that parades our
streets to manifest the popular desire for
a return to protection and prosperity and
the popular will to maintain the honor of
tne Nation and the law of the Republic.
Bryanisni has ceased to mean free silver
and free trade as economic issues. It
represents now tnose things only because
they can be used as cries and as arguments
to rouse and excite the minds of the peo
ple against the existing structure of
American society. It is the courts and
tbe Government, as well as manufacturers
and corporations, that are being assailed
by the Bryanites. Why, then, should not
Â«very owner of property, every friend of
law and every chamnion of National
honor march together on the day that
closes the great campaign for all which
they respect, revere and hold sacoed?
Let the people begin at once their
preparations for the great day. Let them
be ready to have their homes and their
business houses made radiant with ban
ners and bunting, displaying loyalty to
protection, reciprocity, sound money,
law, order. Rood government, National
integrity, National honor and alt that
the good citizen proposes to vote for on
election day. Let them arrange, as far as
possible, to take part in the procession,
whose long parade will manifest to Tom
Reed the welcome which California has
for him, and the loyal sympathy with
which it supports him in his devotion to
tbe cause of the Union and the prosperity
| of the people.
There should be no shirkers from this
duty which patriotism owes to a great
leader, a great cauÂ«e and a great occasion.
Let every citizen who can join in. Lat us
make it as nearly unanimous as possible.
Let us demonstrate on that Saturday
how California will go on election day.
A party â wnlcli hag shown Itself capa
ble of the outrages of the Chicago plat
form is not one that can ever he trusted
with the duties and rejpousibitlties of
government la any locality or in either
high or low degree. The true spirit
which has always been the underlying
force in modern Democracy lv this
oountry after years of effort has at last
obtained control of the party. The
spectacle is at once revolting and en
lightening, and disclosure should rtrive
It from power forever. â Thomas C Platt.
CLEVELAND AT PRINCETON.
The address of Mr. Cleveland at Prince
ton University will go far to redeem his
fame as a speechmaker. It was short,
clear and thoughtful; it was free from
that egotism which has hitherto marked
bis public addresses, and was marred in
style by none of those dull and ponderous
sentences in which he often seeks to con
ceal the platitudes of sentiment by strained
efforts at sonorous and impressive words.
His speech at Princeton was an earnest
appeal to the universities to exert a help
ful Influence v; on tbe public mind in
politics as well as in Questions of science t
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1896.
and letters. In a nation like ours, aa he
says, charged with the care of numerous
and widely varied interests, a spirit of
conservatism and toleration among the
people is absolutely eÃsentJal to the wel
fare of ti e Republic, and it ia the duty of
men who have had the advantages of uni
versity education lo exert their influence
in promoting these sentiments, without
which popular Government is almost an
impossibility.
A Government of universal suffrage has
no anchorage except in the intelligence of
the people, and while, as Mr. Cleveland
said, the advantages of a collegiate educa
tion are by no means necessary to good
citizenship, it is important that the col
lege graduate should be active and earnest
in assisting to promote the general under
standing of those difficult and complex
problems which are at times submitted to
the popular vote for decision. In such
elections every intelligent man is charged
witn a serious responsibility, and it is but
natural the people should look to lind that
intelligence among the graduates of uni
versities.
In a notable passage of his address, the
President said:
When the excitement of party war/are
presses dangerously near our National sale
guards I would have the intelligent conserva
tism of our universities ana colleges warn the
contestants in impressive tones against the
perils of a breach impossible to repair. When
popular discontent and passion are stimulated
by designing partisans to a pitch perilously
near class hatred or sectional anger, 1 would
have our universities and colleges sound an
alarm in the name of American brotherhood
and fraternal dependence.
These words of the President, while
they will serve as advice and counsel to
the students of our universities for future
generations, have their most important
application to the affairs of to-day. The
opponents of Mr. Cleveland may perhaps
charere him with inconsistency, inasmuch
as four years ago he was himself leader in
a campaign which was largely marked by
unscrupulous efforts to excite labor against
capital and farmers against manufactur
ers. The country at large, however, will
care little for what was done in the past
since it is evident that Mr. Cleveland sees
now the folly of his course and is doing all
he can to allay the storm he raised and
check the riotous tendencies of his party.
His speech will be read by the country
with reference to the issues of to-day, and
being so read will doubtless have its in
fluence, not only in universities, but
among men of light, learning and intelli
gence in every part of the Union.
TACTICS OF DESPAIR.
In a letter to the Boston Journal written
early in the montn Mr. Manley of Maine
said:
The remaining weeks of the campaign will
be filled with all sorts of false reports which
will be circulated in relation to the labor vote
and the coercion of employes by employers,
and every political falsehood that the \vildest,
imagination can invent will be started and
circulated in order to discourage and discon
cert the great army of Republicans and honest
money Democrats who are fighting Bide by
side in this splendid battle- We should not
be disturbed by these rumors. In the East
they will say that the West is all wrong. In
ihe West they will give out that the East is
doubtful.
This prediction of the tactics to be em
ployed by the Bryanites has been verified
to the letter by the events of the time
which has passed since the letter was
written. The false rumors and reports of
which Mr. Manley spoke have been pub
lished day after day in every Bryanite
organ, and notably in the chief organ of
that party in this City. Fortunately fore
warned was forearmed. The cry of co
ercion has not been so effective as tbe
orators and organs of the Popocrats ex
pected. On the other band it has proven
to be something of a roorback. Tbe work
ingmen of the country have regarded it as
an insult to their manhood. Business
men have looked upon it as a slander upon
American citizenship, and it has hurt the
Bryan cause as much as any blunder com
mitted by the fusion leaders during the
campaign.
It is too late, however, for the Bryan
leaders to devise a new system of cam
paigning now. The tactics they have
adopted they must stick to, and with them
fight the battle to a finish. We shall hear
much of coercion, intimidation, from now
till election day. We shall hear also loud
boasts of what will happen in the East,
and there will not be lacking equally loud
boasts of Popocratic success in the West.
In fact, it will be on the part of the Bry
anites a system of Chinese tactics, in
which they will endeavor to frighten their
foes by hideous noise and horrible masks.
Intelligent men will not be alarmed by
either the clamor of coercion or the boasts
of coming success. Careful polls have
made it certain that the so-called doubtful
States â Illinois, Indiana and Michigan â
are virtually as safe for protection and
prosperity as are Massachusetts, New
York and Pennsylvania. The election of
McKinley is, indeed, sure. The thine for i
California Republicans to work for is to
put this State into the McKinley column,
and if loyal Republicans and honest
money Democrats stand together and
work as they should do there will be no
doubt of the result here any more than in
Ohio.
The Pcpocrats are, in fact, demoralized,
dismayed and flying from the field.
Almost every day we hear of some noted
Democratic leader like Morrison leaving
the party even at this late hour, and N we
hear also of Republicans who at first de
clared they woula vote the fusion ticket
now coming back to renew their allegiance
to the grand old party. All the evidence,
therefore, assures the faith of the sau
guine. All the omens are for victory. All
the prospects are for prosperity. Let us
go forward in the certainty that the vic
tory is ours and that the one thing left to
do is to turn the defeat of Bryan ism into
such a rout as will drive it forever from
American politics.
THE SUNDAY CALL.
To-morrow's issue of The Uaix will be
replete with highly interesting and enter
taining reading matter, fully m keeping
with its reputation as the representative
Sunday newspaper of the Pacific Coast.
Among the notable features will be a
lucid account of a remarkable discovery
which opens a new door to science and
which may lead to wonderful results alto
gether unexpected.
"An Original Study of a Heated Time
in Politics" makes timely reading and
will be generally appreciated. A careful
observer notes some of the most peculiar
local aspects of the present National con
test.
One of the best Indian stories, thrilling
in its nature and founded on truth, is told
by Ida Meacham Strobridge in "The Un
timely Taking Oft of Black Rock Tom."
In illustration The Sunday Call takes
leading rank, but especial mention should
be made of the "Bars and Picturesque
Scenes" of wildernesses not far remote
from this City.
In literature, art and science, in fash
ion gossip and social intelligence, in its
history of local occurrences and in its
valuable telegraphic service, embracing
the news of the world, Thb Susdat Call
is certainly a model paper.
HON. THOMAS B. O'BRIEN.
Thomas B. O'Brien, the Republican nominee for Congress in the Fourth District,
is making a rattling canvass and is gaining hosts of friends outside his own party*
Mr. O'Brien came to Ban Francisco in 1872 and ever since that time he has been more
or less in the p Ã¼blic eye. He stumped the State for the new constitution ana in the
memorable compaign o? 1879 he was an earrfest advocate of the election of William F.
White, candidate of the Workingmen's party for Governor. In 1884 Mr. O'Brien was
engaged in the campaign in tbe Eastern States and earnestly advocated the election
of Blame and Logan from the stump. In the gubernatorial campaign of 1890 he did
effective work as a stump-speaker for Markham and Keduick. He was selected by
Labor Commissioner Walz as his deputy and was highly commended by that official
for his work in the compilation of industrial statistics. Mr. O'Brien has been a miner
and a journalist, in the latter vocation bavins aided to found the Dutch Flat Forum.
He was also editor and proprietor of the Irish-American in this City. Mr. O'Brien is
an earnest advocate of the policy of protection to American labor and upon that issue
he is making his canvass.
"lam," said Mr. O'Brien in a recent speech, "determined to contest this district
with my free-trade opponent and demonstrate that the quenched furnaces, silent
mills and reduction of employment are attributable to tbe blighting policy of the
tariff- for-revenue reformers."

WHOLLY UNPARALLELED.
Hopeless Breaking-Down of ths Democratic
Canvass in thk Last of thb
Campaign.
The politicians are slow to perceive or admit
the unprecedented nature of this campaign.
Old habit or professional pTide leads them to
keep up the deer old mystifications. They
look bold and wise in public and privately are
banged if they know anything about it; they
put iorth their "claims" and "estimates," tell
you of "weak spots" which they are going
providently to strengthen, and con less that
two weeks ago things did indeed look alarm
ing, though their herculean efforts have now
made the prospect roseate again, in short,
they act jURt as if this were an ordinary closely
balanced campaign. But its unparalleled na
ture and the broad sweeping lines of Its de
velopment are obvious to every eye, and make
the oosiiiK and mystery of the politicians suf
ficiently ridiculous.
When was New York, with its thirty-six
electoral votes, ever before made so little de
batable that, from the start, the only question
has been whether the majority would be
200,000 or 300,000? When before did a party,
by the mere act of writing a platform, drive
away 1,000,000 voters? When did any one
ever know of a canvass so hopelessly breaking
down in the last weeks as the Democratic can-
vass this year, wrangling and recrimination,
confusion and despair marking its last days?
These are some of tne things which everybody
enn fee, and yet our amusing friends, the
political managers, wouid have us hold our
breath and look awe-stricken while they tell
us what to do and expect. â New York Evening
Post.

THE GOVERNMENT STAMP.
The late General George A. Sheridan was ad
dressing an Ohio audience in the year when
the greenback movement had its being and
was speaKing in favor of honest money when
along-haired greenbacker asked him the fol
lowing question: "If the Government of the
United States takes a piece of paper and
prints on one side of it the words, 'This is one
dollar,' and under it that it. is a legal tender
for all debts, customs and public dues, and on
the back of it prints the words, 'This Is one
dollar.' do you mean to say that it does not
make it & good dollar and as good for use as
any gold or silver coin in the United States?"
Quick as a flasii came the response, "My friend,
I will answer your question by asking you an
other. Suppose the Government of the United
States should take you and stamp on your
forehead the words, 'Daniel Webster.' Suppose
they should pick you up and run you through
one of the Government printing-office* and
stamp on your back in letters a foot long,
'Daniel Webster.' Now, would that make you
a United States Senator?"â Rochester Post-
Express.
FIXING THE PRICE.
When the Government fixes the pricft of sil
ver at $1 29 an ounce that will fix tbe price
throughout the world. â W. J. Bryan.
The only way to "fix the price" of anything
is to buy il and pay for it at the price to be
"fixed." But nobody has proposed that the
Government treat silver lv that way. The
plan is that the Government shall receive sil
ver, keep it long enough to mint it and mark
a fictitious value on It, and hand it back to Its
owners. The latter do not sell it. They sim
ply have it molded and stamped, and then
take it away to own and use as they please.
There is nothing in the entire transaction that
partakes of the nature of purchase and sale,
aud therefore nothing tnat cau have any
effect in "fixing a price."â Rochester Demo

When tbe threat'ning clouds have vanished and
the skies are bright and clear:
When again our eagle plumes his wings and lifts
his golden c-p "
And soars in ]>ru..<i defiance over North, South,
East and West.
How hts lusty scream will gladden every patriotic
soul!
How he'll scatter In confusion wild the vulture

The Popocratlc buzzard and the anarchistic

When the frost is on the pumpkin and tbe fodder's

Of Alexander Hamilton and Washington, so true.
Of Lincoln, Grant and Garfieldâ of all our heroes

The song of our redemption from the craze of '96,
Of victory over demagogues and Popocraiic tricks.

Celestial Empireâ p., Vallejo, Cal. Why -
the Chinese call their country the "Celestial
Empire" and why they are called "Celestials"
is explained by Dr. S. W. Williams in bis book,
"The Middle Kingdom," as follows:
The â¢â¢ Chinese have many names to designate
themselves and the land they Inhabit. One of the
most ancient of these Tien ilia, meaning; "be- :
neath the sky," and denoting the world; another
almost as 'ancient is 'Sz Hal, or (all within) "the
Four Seas"; while a third is Chung Kwoh, or
"Middle Kingdom." This last dates from the
establishment of the ChaD dynasty, about 1150
B. C, when the imperial - family so called its , own
special state in llonaii, because it was surrounded
by all the others: The name was retained as the
empire grew, and thus bits bees, strengthened the [
popular belie! that it is In the **nter of the earth.
All the names Indicate the van'*y and the iinor
ance of thÂ« people respecting their geographical â 
position and their rank among the nations. They .
have Dot been alone in this . foible, lor the Egyp
tians, Greeks and Romans all had their terms
for their possessions, which . intimated their
own ideas of their superiority: while, too, the
area â . ot . none of these * monarchies In their
widest extent equaled that of China proper. The
family of Thaln, which flourished about 246 years
before â¢ Christ, also established the custom, slice
continued, of calling the country by the name of
the dynasty then reigning. The term now fre
quently heard In western countries, the Celestial
Kmpire, is derived from Tien Chanâ l. c., "Heav
enly dynasty," meaning the kingdom which the
dynasty appointed by heaven rales over, bat the*
term "Celestials" is entirely of foreign manufac
ture, and their language rould with, difficulty be
made to express such a patronymic. The expres
sions Hwa Yen, 'â¢The Flowery Language," and
Chung Hwa > Kwoh; "The Middle Flowery King
dom,' 7 are frequently used tor the written lan
guage of the country, because the Chinese con
sider themselves to be among tbe most polished
and civilized of all | nations, which is the sense Of
bwa (translated flowery) In these phrases. *

CHASING ANOTHER
OCEAN DERELICT
The Linlithgow Abandoned
by Captain and
Crew.
Broke Her Shaft Several Months
Ago and Has Been Adrift
Ever Since.
TUG FECKLESS TO THE RESCUE
Several Accidents on the San Jose
Wi 1 Give Rise to Mary
Libel Suits.
The Spreckeis tug Fearless now in
Puget Sound may be sent after the British
trampsteamer Linlithgow. The latter left
here some months aero with a cargo of
bariey valued at $77,575, and when tbe
mate put in at Acajutia in one of tbe
ship's boats soon after and reported
the steamer in distress but little
notice was taken of it. The mate, how
ever, evidently was confident that it
would be months before he saw his ship
again, as he took passage for New York
and arrived there last Wednesday. He
pave no further particulars of the disaster
than have already been published in The'
Call.
Yesterday Balfour, Guthrie & Co. re
ceived a caole from San Jose de Guatemala
stating that Captain tetrie and twelve of
the crew had landed there and that the
Linlithgow had been abandoned. A
boat's crew with thirteen men on it is
missing. Inclusive, the vessel and cargo
are worth over $200,000, so should the
Fearless succeed in picking her up there
will be a email fortune for the owners of
the tug.
Captain Hawley, the suDerintendent of
the tugboats, had the matter under con
sideration yesterday. The fact that the
vessel has beer; abandoned is certain, but
the latitude and longitude is not given,
aud not a word is said in regard to her
condition. In the mean time the Fearless
will take on 250 tons of coal at Nanaimo,
B. C., and when she reaches the Golden
Gate Captain Hawiey will have fuller par
ticulars. Should there be a fighting
chance of saying the tramp the big tug
will be sent on.
The Pacific Mail Company's Acapulco
got in from Panama and way ports yes
terday. She brought up twenty-eight
cabin and twenty steerage passengers.
Among the former were Mrs. Josefa Ezeta
and her four children. She has come
here to join her husband, the ei-V ice-Pres
ident oi Salvador, and will take up her
residence with him at the Galindo Hotel
in Oakland. Tne family will make a home
here, and later on may return to Central
America when "the sky is clearing. "
"Jack" McAuliffe, tbe pugilist, also came j
on the steamer.
The Acapulco brings the news of a seri
ous accident on the San Jose. When the
latter was leaving San Francisco and off
Biack Point tbe packing of the manhole
in the port boiler blew out. No one was
hurt and the damage was repaired. About j
twelve hours later the packing blew out !
again, and this time B. Molloy, Jim Mc-
Murry and several other firemen were
badly scalded by the escaping water und
steam. Tbe doctor had his hands full,
and, to make matters worse, a bucketful
of ashes fell on J. O'Brien and dislocated
his shoulder. When the Acapulco was
sighted Captain Russell signaled her to
heave to, as he wanted to put some men
aboard. Molloy and O'Brien were put in
slings and lowered into the boat and put
aboard the Acapulco. The doctor on tne
latter steamer reduced O'Brien's disloca
tion and be was able to walk ashore when
the vessel docked. Molloy is on the road
to recovery, but wiJl have to spend several
months in tbe Marine Hospital before he
will be able to use bis Ings.
The other men that were scalded by the
escaping steam are still on the San Jose,
but Captain Cattarinich of Acapulco says
they were on a fair way to recovery.
"Teddy" Osborne, late of the steamer
Sausalito, has another fad on bis hands.
He is what Charley Bruce, Ben Markley
and others who live at the town in Mann
County call a "crank," and bis crankiness
consists in handling a nickel-in-the-slot

night the machine erinds out "A Life on

a life in the ocean wave. "Teddy" is

NEW HOME FOR A
GREAT MISSION
The Social Settlement Plan
Proves a Success in
Southside.
Wonderful Work Among the Sick

MONUMENT TO REV. W. L KIP.
No Other Institution Like It West of
Chicagoâ Will Be Consecrated
Free of Debt.
For over two years the Mission of the
Good Samaritan bas conducted its opera
tions in a structure once occupied as a
saloon and restaurant, at the corner of
Second and Folsom streets.
When the project of a mission houÂ«e in
The New Home of the Mission of the Good Samaritan,
tbis part of the City was considered by a
committee of clergy and iaity of the Epis
copal church about three years ago the
site selected was the one now occupied by
the mission.
The annals of the mission from its in
ception baa been one of wonderful and
unremitting growth.
Tbe mission is really a social settle
ment. Within the limited area of the
present bouse has been conducted besides
the religious services a library for men,
sewing and cooking school--, a labor
bureau, woodyard, bathing-rooms, a dis
tributing headquarters for clothing and
other necessaries, a surgery and free dis
pensary for the sick, and besides these
there is a Helpers' Home, conducted by a
band of women whose sole occupation
consists in administering comfort and
consolation besides material assistance to
women who are unfortunate and desti
tute. A large portion of the second floor
of the new bouse is to be fitted up exclu
sively for the service of women.
Bishop Nichols regards the Mission of
the Good Samaritan as of tbe most en
couraging facts of his episcopate, and says
it must be maintained at all hazards.
The plaus adopted are for a building 45
by 95 feet in dimensions, two stories in
height and built of wood. The upper floor
is for the chapel, which is to be provided
with robing rooms, vestry, chancel and
organ chamber, and, with the galleries,
will seat upward of 450 people. Tha
first floor is to contain every appurte
nance for the active work of the mission ;
a surgery and dispensary, well fitted up,
are to be a principal feature, and other
rooms for conducting tbe charitable work
of tbe mission, for meetings and for other
purposes, are to be provided. A special
feature will be a gymnasium for the boys'
club connected with the mission, which,
for a time, owing to a lack of room, it was
necessary to disband.
The mission rejoices in a bey choir
which now numbers thirty members and
is acknowledged to be one of the best
trained in the diocese.
The new structure will occupy two lots
directly opposite the site of the present
mission, adjoining where the old Wieland
homestead used to stand. Albert Sutton
is the architect.
ANGRY WITH DEVOTO
Populists Likely to Knife Spinetti Be
cause Uevoto Advised Sauguinetti
Not to Withdraw for Huppert.
The Buckleyites are considerably an
gered over the refusal of Sanguinetti to
come down from bis supervisorial candi
dacy in the First Ward. A previous
agreement had been made with the Popu
lists that when one of their number was
nominated for any office the Buckley man
should be withdrawn. Several men at the
word of the boss did so, but when Sangui
netti's name was reached there was a row.
Henry Huppert was the Pofulist nomi
nee. So the edict went forth that
Sanguinetti must withdraw from the race.
Hut Buckley counted without nis Sangui
netti. Acting under the advice of Attor
ney James A. Devoto the Italian nominee
announced his intention to stay.
He was pleaded with and every possible
inducement was offered for him to obey
the boss' request, but Sanguinetti re
mained firm as adamant. Then the wrath
of the Buckleyites began to rise. For the
stubborn candidate's action Attorney De
voto is blamed, and revenge mu^t be had.
The programme now is for the Populists
to knife Spinetti, Devoto's nominee lor
Police Judge, whom the Populists in
dorsed at their municipal convention.
Populist leaders, it is said, have agreed to
tbis.
Both Buckleyltes and Populiats are now
keeping a close eye on Banguinetti's legal
adviser. They assert that not only will
any man he ever brings forward be knifed,
but if he ever develops any strong idea of
running for office himself the score will be
evened op. _

ARMY OFFICERS
GETTING SETTLED
Like Their New Quarters
and the Change From
Florida's Heat.
Lieutenant-Colonel Williston Is
Still Putting Up at a Hotel
Downtown.
WHO THE NEWCOMERS ARE.
All. of Them Are Veterans of the
War and Have Seen Hot
Fighting.
The officers and men of the Third Artil
lery, who have just arrived from the far
Southeast, are rapidly adjusting them
selves to their new condition? and sur
roundings, and all of them freely confess
to being pleased with the change.
Lieutenant-Colonel Williston, with his
wife and daughter, are still stopping at
the Occidental Hotel, the colonel's quar
ters at the Presidio not being fitted up as
yet. Colonel Bain bridge, however, is al
ready located at bis quarters at Angel
Island, the headquarters of the regiment.
There are four batteries still to arrive,
two light batteries and two foot batteries.
They are on the way ana are expected to
arrive within a week. Two of them come
from Washington and St. Ausustine,
where they have been located for the past
four years, and two of them from Key
West.
This, by the way, is not the first tour of
duty that Colonel Bainbridjte has served
on this coast. He was graduated from
W#st Point in 1856 and therefore hnd been
in the service about four years previous to
the beginning of the war, most of which
had been spent here and at other points
along the coast. Colonel Bainbridge
served with distinction throughout the
war, chiefly with the Fifth Artillery.
He served later as lieutenant-colonel of
the Third Artillery Regiment, and two
years ago was advanced to its command.
Lieutenant-Colonel Williston entered
the regular service in 1861 by appointment.
He served in the Second Regiment until
two years ago. Both colonel and lieu
tenant-colonel are about 60 years of age.
Captain Chester, commanding Battery
A, stationed at Alcatraz Island, is the
senior captain of the regiment. He has a
handsome army record, which begins at
Fort. Sumter.
Captain O'Hara is npxt in order of rank.
He is a graduate of West Point, class of
'66. He has command of Battery H. Cap
tain Hess of Battery L comes next. He
is at Aicatraz with Captain Chester. He
was a major in the Pennsylvania cavalry
during the war.
Japtain Sedgewick Pratt, commanding
Battery E, stationed at Fost Mason, was a
graduate of the clues of '67, West Point.
Captain Humphreys of Battery D served
through the war in the volunteer
service and entered the regular army at
the close of ihe trouble in '66. He is sta
tioned with his company at Angel Island.
Captain Joseph M. Califl, In command
of Battery G, is stationed at the Presidio.
He entered the regular army also at the
close of the war, having served three
years in the Army of the Potomac.
Captain Kobbe, commanding Battery
M, goes to Fort Canby, at the mouth of
the Columbia River. The command comes
from Fortress Monroe.
Seven of the eleven batteries have come
from points iv Florida. The headquarters
of the regiment was at St. Augustine.
Stationed there with Colonel Bain bridge
were Captains Pratt and O'Hara and their
commands. Lieutenant-Colonel Williston
and Captains Chester and Califf were at
Barrancas. Captain Hess and Humphreys
were at Jackson Barracks, New Orleans.
The others, as stated, came from Key
West and Washington.

A WEEK OF SPORTS,
Notes of the Gun, the Rod, the Wheel, the
Oar and the Ring*
The arrival of Jack McAuliffe, the
champion light-wei>iht pugilist, has
stirred up an interest in boxing. Mc-
AuhfTe arrived on the Acapulco and will
go into immediate training lor a ten
rennd contest with James Fleming
Carroll, which will he held in this City
next month under the auspices of the St.
George's Club.
The wheelmen have arranged for several
road races to-morrow.
Oarsmen who are in training for the
regatta look forward to sharply contested
races between the local crews and the big
scullers of Stockton.
Ihe opening of the new coursing track
at Ocean View next week will give an im
petus to the sport.
The sportsmen are growling because of
a continuance of fine weather. They say
that good shooting will not be had until
after the first storm.
THE WHEELMEN.
Three Road Races and Several
Record Trials on for To-Morrow.
CLUB EVENTS.
Alamcda Cyclersâ Road race, San Le
lUiliu to H.-ty\v:ir<U.
California Cycling Clubâ Road race,
San Mi-teu to San Carlos.
Camera Club Cyclistsâ Run to Kiles
Canyon.
Imperial Cycling Club â Road race,
Fruit vale to Haywards.
San Francisco Road Clubâ to Hay-
arris. .
More road races and record trials are j
scheduled for to-morrow, and with the con
tinuance of fair weather there will probably
be a number of these events each week. I
The course from San Leandro to Â±iay
wards was never in better condition than
now, and fast time is always the rule.
Walter F. .foster, the crack Olympic
professional, intended to try for the rive
mile record there to-morrow, but met
with an accident Thursday which will
oblige him to defer the attempt. He was
following a triplet pacing machine manned
by George E. ; Dixon and . S. B. Vincent,
Bay City Wheelmen, and Russell dish
ing, Garden City Cyclers, when the triplet
slipped in a wet place and went down.
Foster was close up and piled right on top
of the machine and its riders. All were
considerably bruised, and it is a wonder
that no bones were broken.
George M. Hamlin of the San Francisco
Road Club will try to lower Frank Byrne's
ten-mile record of 24:27 to-morrow, pac d
by several tandem teams. The general J
impression is that he will do it handily.
Then the Imperial Cycling Club has a
ten-mile handicap race on the cards, which
will start from High street, Fruitvale, at
11 o'clock. Captain Trolliet will take the
members over on a run on the 9 o'clock j
boat. Ihe entry-list is large and an inter
esting race is promised. Several of the
Imperials will ride in this race for the sole
purpose of lowering the existing record,
and there is no reason why Lind, Cook
and one or two others should not turn the
trick.
The Alameoa Cyclers will hold a five
mile race to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock '
from San Leandro to Hay wards, for which
tnere are thirty-four entries, who have
been handicapped as follows:
A. E. Cumbers and J. G. Hurley, scratch: C.
A. Park, 15 sec; George Thorn and E. M.
Whalley, 30 sec. J. Roos and M. E. Games, 45

is to immerse the wheel in a tub of water,
Wherever the air bubbles there will be
found a puncture. In some cases, how
ever, the air pressure is not sufficient to
make the air bubbles. In canes of this
kind lather some soap and smear it over
the tire. A soap bubble will form over
every puncture, it matters not how small
it is.

The racing men wno had grievances
with the racing board and otficia ls of the
associated ciubs regarding the recent ten
mile road race have expressed themselves
hs more than satisfied with the very fair
treatment they were accorded at last Mon
day night's meeting. Every one was
eiven satisfaction in some way, and the
racing board covered itself with glory by
j its clever handling of the many pro
tests. What seemed a hopeless tangle
was finally completely straightened out,

were all eiven the benefit of the doubt
and received their prizes t c same as if

DUCK AND QUAIL.
Sportsmen Who Mot With Indif
ferent Success.
Duck and quail hunters are anxiously
waiting for trie first good rainstorm, which
will very materially improve both marsh
and upland shooting. Quail have been
found quite plentiful in many places not
far distant from this City, but sportsmen
who have tramped the slippery hills in
the hor>e of securing good shooting report
that they found the birds very wild and
hid away in places where the undergrowth
was too heavy to be penetrated by dog or
man.
Quail will remain close to heavy cover
until the earth will be the recipient of a
good drenching, after which time the
lovers of quail-snooting may look pleas
antly forward to rirst-class sport, pro
vided, of course, that they will be accom
panied by one or two well-broken dozs.
Quail-shooting is indeed a rnuph and
vexing pastime when the srortsmen has
to act doe himsel f. Still, a pointer or set
ter that is not thoroughly trained is un
questionably an intolerable nuisance in
the field.
Latest reports from Suisun are to the
effect that the northern fliaht of wild
ducks has arrived and that tolerably good
sport is now enjoyed by those who shoot
over decoy*. Two hunters who are rusti
cating in McÃne and Merkle's ark bagged
fifty-seven large ducks last Tuesday, and
it is said that tnree hunters from Suisun
made quite a large killing of teal and mal
lard on Wednesday evening. Birds are
very plentiful in the Suisun marshes, but
the cream of the shooting is yet to come.
The first storm will open up a great
day's shooting in the Suisun. Sonoma and
Aiameda marshes. Billy Williams bagged
between three and four dozen birds near
Midshipman's Slough, in the Sonoma
marshes, last Thursday, and a man
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1896.
named Thompson killed eighty-nine
uucks, principally teal, widgeon and
spoonbill, in two days' s: ooting in the
marshes near McGills last week. A
majority of the hunters who were out
during the opening days of the season re
turned without a feather.
Thomas Casey shot over his English
setter, Dot, last Sunday on the Pacheco
ranch and of fifty-six cartridges he wasted
on the hillsides he bagged five quail.
Thomas reports that hia gu n was not in
good working order.
Charley Cate has but recently recovered
from a severe attack of pneumonia. He
hopes, however, to be sufficiently con
valescent to give the mallards of Alviso a
hot reception before they take their
departure from the marshes.
The well-known rai!-shooter, Ed Sulli
van, indiscreetly took a little nap last
Saturday on a bunch of poison oak after a
hard tramp in pursuit of quail over the
Belmout hills, and as a result Edward is
now looking out of one eye at his friends.
In other words, Sullivau has sot the
swelled bead.
W. J. Ahem, the presiding officer of the
Sportsmen's Protective Association, has
called a mass-.'neeting of all sportsmen
who are interested in duck-shooting lor
Thursday evening next.
United States District Attorney Knight
has been advised by Government engi
neers that the Frank Horan slough in the
Suisun marshes is unquestionably navi
gable, and that a blockade or obstruction
to navigation in those waters is a trans
gression of the laws ol this country.
Mr. Knight has written on to the Attor
ney-General at Washington for informa
tion as to what action he can take in the
matter. The offense for the blockading of
navigable waters is a serious one, to which
a heavy fine and punishment is attached.
The following letter from W. J. Ahem,
president of the Sportsmen's Protective
Association, is self-explanatory:
Editor Call: There will be a mass-meeting of
the Sportmen's Protective Association, in
Albion Hall, Alcazar biiilUng, on Thursday
evening, October 29, at 8 o'clock sharp. Legis-
lative candidates who indorse our stand on
the preserve club question will be in Attend
ance. Prominent speakers will address the
mreting.
Our attorneys to-day received word from the
I nite-i Slates District Attorney that he agreed
with us that the Frank Hornn Slough was
navigable and that the Cordelia Shooting
Club haa been notified to remove the obstruc
tion and barricade. Very respectfully,

THE ANGLERS.
Locke Special Train for Sportsmen
and Anglers to Russian River.
There are biief periods during the win
ter months when the young salmon run
up the Russian River in schools, in fact
wnen the stream is literally swarming
with fish, and Excursion Manager Locke
proposes to take advantage of these
periods to give the sportsmen of this City
and vicinity special excursions at the-e
times, whereby they can go up to Dun
cans Mills and enjoy a whole day's sport
and get back to the City Sunday night, in
this manner having the fun without in
terfering with business. To carry oat his
plans Mr. Locke has arranged with the
North Pacific Coast Railroad to furnish a
special train to connect with the boat
which leaves the Sausalito ferry at 11:30
o'clock the first Saturday night after the
salmon make their appearance in the
river, for which (-vent lie has arranged to
be notified by telegraph. This train will
reach Duncans Mills about 4 o'clock Sun
day morning, where breakfast will be
ready, so that the anglers can get to work
at daylight.
Returning, the start will be made at
about 5:30 in the evening, reaching the
City at about 9:30 p. M. Preliminary to
the start Mr. Locke is now sec urine the
names and addresses of all who desire to
go, so as to notify each person by mall when
the time arrives, as the fish are liable to
make their appearance almost any time
now, and when they arrive it wilj require
quick work to get ready for the trip. The
railroad company owns several thousand
acres of timbered land just this side of
Duncans Mills, which is open to quail
hunters, who also will receive exceptional
ad ventages by the prospective trip, as
they will be dropped off at any point be
yond Howards.
A popular rate will be given for this
special excursion and all hunters or
anglers who desire to participate should
communicate with Mr. Locke at 333 O'Far
sell street without delay. Attnched to
the train will be one or more special cars
in which there will be no smoking, con
viviality or loud conversation, for the ac
commodation of gentlemen who desire to
take their wives, but the train proper will
be a typical sportsmen's special. In the
event of parties of friends being formed
of sufficient number they will be provided
with private cars for the round trip.
Already considerable interest has been
manifested in the event, nearly eighty
subscribers having been secured for the
initial trip.
THE OARSMEN.
How the Resatta Committee Was
Treated by the Railroad Company.
The Southern Pacific Company haa
given the oarsmen a bad shaking up
financially, and unless the Pacific Ath
letic Association secures prizes from some
of the open-liearted citizens the regatta
which was to be rowed on Oakland Creek
on Thanksgiving day, and for which ex
tensive preparations were already made,
will fall through, as the railroad company
has seen fit to cut its original appropria
tion of $200 almost in two.
8. J. Pembroke, the instigator of the
affair, thinks he can induce the company
to give an amount sufficient, with the
prizes he has received from John D.
English and James D. Phelan, the candi
date for Mayor, to still bring the event
off. He will wait on the Southern Pacific
officials Monday, and if they won't agree
to raise the appropriation he will let the
affair drop.
Gus Carson, tbe afterwaist man of the
South End senior crew, states that he will
be unable to row with the crew in any of
the future regattas, as the position he has
just received will deter him from training
for a race.
James Pallas, the afterwaist of the South
End's intermediate crew, will take Car
son's place in the senior barge, and if the
Thanksgiving day regatta takes place the
seniors will row the Stocicton Giants or
any other crew on the coast.
Flanders 01 the Ariel Club has put a
searchlight on his launch, which is a nov
elty. The light is of 2000 candle-power,
and an object can be discerned on the
darkest ni^ht three miles away.
Fianders had his boat outside the beads
last Sunday to test her seaworthiness, and
incidentally to do a little fishing. The fol
lowing were on board : Andy Carrol,
Albert Carrol, E. Flanders, Fred Redmond
and Len Hatfteld.

FOOTBALL.
Tips on Stanford- Rellanoo Game
This Afternoon.
This afternoon Stanford will play Reli
ance on the Central Park gridiron. It
will be their first meeting this season for
blood. They engaged in a practice game
about a month ago for preparation against
other teams, but neither side scored.
Since that time Reliance has opened the
football season by handily defeating
Berkeley, while Stanford made of her first
match a no-score contest with Olympic.
Both teams, therefore, will come together
to-day for their second match witii a
clean record and will fight hard to hold
the encouraging supremacy of no defeats.
Game will be called at 3 o'clock.
These are the players and the way they
will face their opponents:
Stanford. Position. Reliance.
Jeffs L. Knd R. Lauyon
Harrington L. Tackle R Doesch
Klckert (capt) L. Guard R. Wells
Williams Center Burnett
James R. Guard L Oliver
Cotton R. Tackle i. sexton
Midden K. Knd Jj Lacuna
Murphy Quarter _\ahl
Dole L. Ha f K.... Walton (capt.)
Fisher R. Half L Carter
Soper Fullbacic A. Arlett
In preparation for this match Reliance
has had several practice games with
Berkeley, lrom which, if tne Oakland
clubmen have gained any points at all,
they have certainly learned the advantage
of fast playing. Stanford, after witness
ing on last Saturday Berkeley's snappy
play that resulted to a signal victory over
Olympic, have taken the iiint and will un
doubtedly put up a much livelier game
than in the earlier match with Olympic.
All this week the practice on the Stanford
campus has been particularly lively, tbe
individual players showing more "ginger"
than ever oefore.
Jeffs, the Stanford varsfty left ena of
last year, who has until a week past been
handicapped with rheumatism, has taken
his old position on tbe line and his been
putting up a strong, lively, aggressive
game, characterized by all the fierceness
that made him such a sure man in cover
ing territory and securing fouls as catcher
on the varsity baseball team.
Murphy, the promising freshman quar
terback, who was laid off by a slight in
jury, complicated by serious paternal ob
jections, is another valuable possibility
that has again materialized. He of all
tbe Stanford players, it has been said, has
the best head for the game, and to him
the freshman class looks to captain its
own team to victory against tbe Berkeley
freshmen, and perchance to general the
playing in the great Thanksgiving match.
Reliance and Stanford should play much
the same stylo of came. Both have
strong, i eavy lines, and neither is particu
larly qualified for a punting game. The
play will proDably be characterized by
fierce line-bucking, to which the backs of
both teams are particularly trained.
There can be little doubt that both Reli
ance and Stanford have more powerful
linesmen this season than either Olympic
or Berkeley. The question is, Can they
play in proportion to their strength? Last
Saturday Berkeley's backs made repeated
gains round the' Olympic tackles, who,
because they were helplessly inefficient,
failed signnliy to break up formations that
passed them comparatively without oppo
sition and resulted in long runs that would
not have been possible against tackles
knowing the duties of their position.
That hardly a gain was made tbiough the
Olympic centermen was proof of their su
perior strength, bat they did not use that
advantage in tearing through their weaker
opponents on the college line to break up
passes andpunts.
Burnett, the Reliance center, Oliver, the
guard, and Sexton, the tackle, are sup
posed to be the strongest three men in
those positions in the four big teams.
Oliver is the greatest of the right euards
when his unusually fine interference is
considered in addition to bis work in his
position. The Reliance and Stanford lints
should be almost equal, with an advantage
for Stanford in her ends offset by the
ability of Reliance nearer the center of
the lines. At quarterback Stanford should
Lave the better man. Fisher of Stanford
at half is almost if not hilly the equal of
Captain Walton of Reliance, while several
of the other Stanford candidates for half
back are better player than Carter of Re
liance, whose effectiveness depends much
upon Walton's interference for him. Ar
lett, the Reliance fullback, though com
paratively a new player and not a very
good punter, is a heavy, dashing back and
a good ground-gainer. He is hardly a
match, though, for either Soper or Free
man of Stanford in a punting game.
It has been said by old enthusiasts of
Berkeley that this year's University of
California team is probably the best lot of
football players that have yet represented
the blue and gold. A similar assertion
was made by members of the Stanford
faculty in reference to the players that
will this season defend the cardinal.
Berkeley's wonderfully rapid improve
ment, as judged by the disastrous game
with Reliance and the recent excellent ex
hibition against Olympic, has frightened
the Palo Alto men, who were at first in
clined to rely too much upon the weak
ness of the Berkeley line in figuring, out
the possibilities of the Thanksgiving
game.
COURSING.
Reopening- of Ocean View Park Un-
der New Management,
Coursing men will be pleased to learn
that Ocean View Park, one of the finest
inclosed coursing fields in America, will
reopen on Sunday, November 1, under
new management and with entirely new
accommodations. The grand stand is be
ing rebuilt in such a manner that the
poolboz and other arrangements will be
entirely under cover and as comfortably
arranged as any park in this vicinity. The
opening of the park is due to tbe in
creased interest in the sport.
Time was when one park could accom
modate all, but that has passed and the
popular demand is for another park
where dogs which cannot run on the
grounds now operated, because of the
character of the soil, can have a show.
Ocean View is admitted by all to be a
superior winter coursing ground and will
doubtless be liberally patronized, particu
larly as a splendid lot of Merced hares,
the same as will be coursed at the inter
state meeting, are now in the paddocks.
A new entrance will be opened opposite
the new grand stand, which has been
built sixty feet cityward from the old one.
This gives better facilities for reaching the
cars of Sunny side ami Ocean View wiiich
will step opposite the stand on both the
up and down trips.
The entrance fee for opening day will be
$2, with $60 and a $40 bronze clock added.
A large number ol nrst-class nominations
have already been made for the stake,
which will probably be limited to thirty
two dogs. A separate stand has been pro
vided lor ladies and admission will be free
to all. The management will be in tbe
hands of the Ocean View Coursing Club,
which is composed of some veterans and
some new men in coursing.
Following is the result of the drawing
for the coursing at Ingleside Park to-mor
row:

THE BOXERS.
Arrival of Fat Jack McAullffe.
Groom Is Still Hoping to Match
Sharkey and Fitz.
Jack McAuliffe, the light-weight cham
pion pugilist, arrived yesterday on the
steamer Acapulco from New York. His
friends were at the wharf to welcome him,
but when Jack stepped off the plank there
was only one man in the crowd who recog
nized him, and had it not been for a tip
that he received from one of the passen
gers the pugilist would have positively
escaped unnoticed.
Why McAulifte's friends failed to pick
him out from among the passengers is
readily explained. Jack does not look a
bit like his former self. He has grown as
fat ns a mush melon, and how be can pos
sibly train off thirty or forty pounds of
tallow in a month is a conundrum which
even the great master of ceremonies, Wil
liam Jordan, E3q., would not attempt to
solve.
But McAuliffe is here nevertheless and
reports having had a very pleasant sea
voyage from New York to Frisco. Jack
says he thumped several punching-bags
to pieces while on board ship and that he
assisted the firemen more than once to
pile coal into the furnace. Whatever kind
of manual labor MrAuliffe performed
on board the Acapulco his appearance
would indicate that for every pound of
flesh he lost he gained two. But Jack is
as confident, nevertheless, of whipping
Carroll as he is of returning to New York
after the battle is over. He says that he
will not find it much of a trick to drop off
twenty pounds or so of avoirdupois in a
month when on dry land, and that for a
ten-round contest he will not need to be in
racehorse shape.
Jimmy Carroll has different ideas regard
ing the condition a man must necessarily
be in to go through ten rounds of heavy
smashing, an>i be has trained with a view I
of whipping General Jack in short order.
But time will tell whether old age and fine
condition can turn the tables on youth
and poor condition.
Manager ttroom has not yet given up
hope of matching Sharkey and Fiizsim
mons, although the latter does not seem
to be particularly anxious to get into a
ring with the sailor.
Corbett is out of the race. Groom says |
if Fitzsimmons will refuse to give him a
decisive answer within a week that he will
offer very flattering inducements to Peter
Maher to meet Sharkey in this City.

'him'/ / iiW/ for science and humanity,
you wonder how it is that
every weak man in the world
has not already been made strong. Surely such multitudes of
cures as they promise must quickly absorb all the subjects ready
to be worked upon â if they cure. The fact that thousands of
men have tried all of them, one after another, in turn, and
finally given up in despair proves that they do not cure ; the
stronger fact that in nine cases out of ten after the medicine has
failed they finally, tell their patients that the only cure for them
is an electric belt, which they have for sale, is proof that they
start at the wrong end â medicine first, and electricity as a last
! resort. Then what does cure weak men? The answer is plain.
Those who have had experience with all-sorts of treatment, and
have ; finally been cured, vouch for DR. ANDEN' ELECTRIC
BELT. Start right by using it first, and there will then be no need
for drug treatment, of which so : many unfortunate sufferers have
sickened. If you do not use electricity at first you will have to
in the end, for nothing else will restore the power of the nerves
and vital organs.
' , H. Stuart, 1180 Market street, San - : ; Francisco, says : "I purchased one : of . your
belts last spring for seminal weakness, from which *1 had suffered many years. I
spent all the money I earned for medicine, but to no avail. Your belt has done me
more good than any amount of medicine ever could; and I feel grateful to you for my
| recovery." .'. - â ^," : "-j'[j"-' ::'./;":'"â  ':'."â â â '.'; "- ' ' ". . ." ,
Dr. Sanden's Belt always cures, because it is applied on the

Preparations for the Mam

Saturday.
/The Patriot From Maine Will
Receive a Most Royal
.; Reception.
â¢ : . A SPEECH IN THE EVENING.
- There Will Also Be a Big Turn-Out
To-Night in San Jose of Uni
formed Clubs.
â¢. Tbe Republican State Central Commit
tee and the National Republican rarade
. Committee are masing elaborate prepara
tions for the reception of Thomas B. Reed
of Maine and the bitr procession on Satur
day, a week from to-day.
Mr. Reed will arrive in Los Angeles by
the Santa Fe route next Tuesday at 1:25
P. v., accompanied by his daughter,
. Kittie. He will be received at tbe depot
yW a delegation of prominent citizens,
J . th Democrats and Republicans, who are
\ sound-money men, and will be escorted
into the city with great glory. A half
â¢ holiday will be declared on that day in the
city and county of Los Angeles, and ail
the stores, workshops and manufactories
Trill be closed. It is expected that there
will be at least 30,000 people in line.
Mr. Reed will speak iv Loa Angelas in
* the afternoon of that day, and will leave
in the evening for Stockton, where he will
speak on Wednesday. It was his own
desire to go to Stockton, because that had
been the home of his youth and the place
where he taught a country school. His
daughter, Kiltie, has also expressed a de
sire to see the place where her father
made bis first start' in life. Thence he
- will go to San Jose and speak there on
Thursday. On Friday he will speak in.
Santa Rosa, and on Saturday he will come
to this City to review tbe parade in the
afternoon, and in the evening he will
speak In Woodward's Gardens Pavilion.
He will remain here on Sunday, and will
epeak in Oakland next Monday.
Preparations for the big parade to be
held here Saturday next are being pushed
forward energetically by the committee of
which Frank Suniner is'chairman, and by
â¢ Grand Marshal George Sione. The follow
ing letter was received by Colonel Sumner
yesterday from the Republican State Cen
tral Committee:
My Dear Colonel- After consultation with a
number of party leaders this committee has
arrived at the conclusion that It would con
serve the best interests of the Republican
cause if our greac parade were held in the aft
ernoon instead of evening as originallly
planned, inasmuch as the Hon. Thomas B.
Keed is billed to speak at the Pavilion that
night and we desire to have as large an atten
dance of voters a; his meeting as possible, and
'thus fittingly close our campaign in a blaze of
giory, which will enable us to take off our
gloves for final work that will permit us to in
dulge in a good, hearty handshake over the
' result on November 4.
In view of the above conditiona this com
mittee, as well as myself personally, would es
" teem it a favor if you will co-operate with us
to the ena that the projected parnde be brought
'off in the daytime instead oi the evening.
Trusting that you will coincide in our views
â¢ and hoping soon to receive a favorab.e reply,
| 1 am, my dear colonel, yours very truly,
1 Frank McLaughlin, Chairman.
Colonel Sumner thereupon transmitted
.the following to Colonel Stone, the grand
. marshal oi the parade:
Dear Sir: The ReDublican State committee
'. has just been informed that Hon. Thomas B.
Reed oi Maine will speak in this Cay on Satur
day eveninjr, October 31. We have been asked
to change tne hoar for parading to the after
noon of the s>arae day and to join with the
State committee in making it the day ot the
campaign.
Believing this to be the wisest course the
'â¢ parade committee has adopted the suggestion,
and would ask every Republican club within
reach of San Francisco to join with the busi
ness and laboring men of this City to make it
tbe grandest end most impressive political
demonstration ever known .n the WeÂ»t. Very
truly yours, Frank W. Scmker. Chairman.
Colonel Stone said yesterday: "We
want to make this the big.est demonstra
tion that this City has ever seen. My idea
â¢ is that the uniform clubs of this City -hail
then form as an escort in the evening with
torches and transparencies for tue pur
pose of marching with Mr. Reed to tbe
Pavilion. Tiie galleries will be reserved
for the uniformed clubs and the ladies. It
ia our intention to make the day a half
holiday, and b is expected that, tbe Repub
licans and sound-money Democrats will
close their places of easiness next Satur
. day at noon.
"We propose also to asK all Republican
organizations within reach of the City and
business men generally from tbe surround- I
ins towns to join us in the parade. Oafc
.- land and Alanaeda will turn out in very
liberal numbers, and from what I have
â . already heard I think that without any
doubt we can have between 30,000 and
40,000 men in line.
"The transparencies of the afternoon
parade will have National mottoes, with
nothing of a local character except the
name of tbe club. The parade will start
at 2 o'clock in tbe af ernoon, and the
route of procession will probably be out
. Howard street to Tenth or Twelfth, to
i Market, down Market, taking in a portion
' â >' Kearny and Montgomery. Each man
4 c parade will carry an American flag,
dt being declared by the Republican Na
tional Comtaittee to be flag day. Ail
Republicans on that day are requested to
float the stars and stripes irom their places
of residence and business."
Petitions, of which the following is the
heading, are being circulated among the
'.. busine?s houses:
We, the undersigned, hereby agree to close
our respective establishments- at noon on Sat
urday, October 31, -in order to enable Ell our
employes who desire to participate In a day
demonstration in honor ot' McKinley and
Hobart and in favor of patriotism, protection
and sound money.
Tbe thanks of the State Central Com
mittee are due to P. W. Van Sicklen and
"" W. M. Rank of Oakland lor collecting the
money with which to defray Mr. Reed's
â¢ipeuaes in coming to San Francisco.
ADDRESSED MECHANICS.
"'â  'D. K. McKlnlay of Santa Rosa at the

â¢ The Potrero Opera-house was thronged

'.-who paid close attention to the able \ ad

who is one of the Republican Presidential
electors. ; ,
% Mr. McKinlay stated that, it is not now
a question of free silver as much ,as it is

The grand marshal of the Republican
CHRIS BUCKLEY IS SVENGALIED
Joseph Asbury Johnson Says That the Blind Boss Is
Taking Orders From Him This Fallâ A
Thrilling Political Episode
Joseph Asbnry Johnson says that Chris Buckley is taking orders from him this
campaign. More than this he avers that Curia has even expressed a belief that some
influence is exercised over him by Johnson. A part of a conversation, as detailed by
Jonnson, ia detached from the remainder and inserted at this place to illustrate one
of tbe most thrilling episodes in tbe political history of San Francisco.
"They say, Mr. Buckley (said Johnson), that I have become one of your lambs
and tuat you have hypnotized me."
"Strange (said Buckley) that they should cay that. It is the other way. Since
we came together I have felt your influence. If either of us has hypnotized the other
you have hypnotized me."
This conversation was one of several, according to Mr. Johnson, and how it came
About was as follows;
"One day," said Mr. Johnson, ; 'one of Chris Buckley's men came to me. I knew
that he was one of Chris' followers. He gave me quite a talk, repeating things which,
be said, Chris nad told him to tell me. These were complimentary to my political
work. I listened awhile and then said:
" 'I should suppose that I would be about the last man in San Francisco that Chris
would send for.'
"'No,' said the messenger, 'you are about the first. He thinks that your course
has shown political sagacity and he wants to talk with you.'
" 'Very well,' said I, 'I am not afraid of what any one may say, and I am not
"You have hypnotized me/ said Mr. Buckley to Mr. Johnson.
afraid to talk with any one, and don't believe that Chris Buckley can hurt me.'
"To make a long story short," continued Mr. Johnson, "I went to see Chris
Buckley with my mind made up as to my course.
" 'Glad to see you, Mr. Johnson,' said Buckley.
" 'How do you do, Mr. Buckley?' said I.
" 'I bave sent to you to talk with you about tbe campaign,' said he.
" 'Very weil, Mr. Buckley,' said I. 'You have got to occupy a new position this
time.'
" 'How is that?' asked he.
" 'Mr. Buckley, this is the time that you hare got to take orders. The Populists
are strongâ very strong. They have mainly been recruited from the Republicans,
the most of them formerly being strong Republicans; consequently, Mr. Buckley,
they are an element that you, as a Democrat, are not acquainted with.'
"Chris sat and thought for two or three minutes. He looked a little puzzled, but
finally said that he would take orders.
â¢' 'Very well,' safd I, 'I thought that you knew a thing or two about politics and
that we could easily understand each other.'
"Mr. Buckley seemed well pleased. After a little talk I went away."
It is a matter of common knowledge that Joseph Asbury Johnson is a candidate
for Supervisor from the Seventh Ward. The fact has also duly impressed itself upon
the receptive mind of the public that the Populists have indorsed several of Buckley's
candidates. The course of current history has been such that the uninitiated may
have mistakenly supposed that Buckley had made "Buckley lambs" of certain Popu
lists. Fortunately Mr. Johnson's narrative throws light into the otherwise dark
places and causes such errors to flee. Whether Buckley had Bwaliowed certain I'opu
lists, or vice versa, Mr. Johnson's story makes debatable.
"I saw Chris one day," Mr, Johnion went on. "A question had arisen as to what
should be done about nominating a certain man. He sent for me to find out about it.
I toid him, and he did as I said."
"Have I not taken orders so far?'.' aakod Chris.
On another occasion Mr. Johnson says that it occurred to him to ask how it was
that Chris was consulting the pubac good. What followed was wort yto be con
signed to canvas by a finer brush than any now wielded by the best sign-painter in
San Francisco. Chris seemed to Mr. Johnson to be visibly moved by his thoughts.
"I will tell you, Mr. Johnson," so Chris said, "I have a little boy (and here his
voice trembled), and I hope that he will find the world better because I have lived in
it and have taken this political course."
It was not at this time that the conversation took place about Chris Buckley hav
ing been "Svengalied" by Joseph Asbury Johnson. As a matter of fact, Mr. Johnson
modestly forebore to say that he really had "Svengalied" the innocuous farmer of
Livermore. Buckley it was who confessed tbe influence of Johnson over him. What
he said and what Mr. Johnson taid he said is duly reported at the opening of this
moving story.
But there is no doubt that Chris felt himself under the hypnotic spell. That
bucolic philosopher, recalling his past life and wishing to leave the world better for
his having lived, and moved almost to tears by the thought of his little son, moved
about the hayfield, rake in hand, and possibly, remembering vanished glories may
have thought his present condition a case of "too much Johnson." ' '
The Bubstanee of this story was voluntarily related to a reporter for The Call by
Joseph Asbury Johnson. He seemed unaware, possibly intentionally so, of the dra
matic features of the case. He and several other candidates will be supported by
Chris, who is supposed by Mr. Jonnson to be doing pure politics, this time Chris
claiming to be hypnotized.

Woman* Annex.
The Woman's Annex to the National
League of Republican Clubs held a spir
ited meeting last evening in its hall at
24 Fourth street ami unanimously resolved
to attend the big parade in San Jose this
evening.
Mrs. George E- Spencer sang the ''Star
spangled Banner" and received an encore
therefor. She afterward read an essay on
â 'Patriotism and Protection," which was
full of timely thoughts.
The annex will meet at the same place
next Friday evening.

More Light Â» anted.
A general demand is being made for
more light in the election booths to
enable voters the mort distinctly to
inspect and mark their ballots. It
has been suggested as a very feasible
plan that small pane 3of ground glass be
placed, one pane over the desk or shell in
each stall. This would furnish all the
light required and would not allow any
one on the outaide to see within. The
windows would not cost more than 30
cent: each.
The Continentals
The Continental League, F. D. Worth
in the chair, decided last night to take
part in the Republican parade next Satur
day nisht.
William A. Deane, regular Republican
candidate for Auditor; Leon E. Jones,
candidate for tne Assembly from the
Thirty-ninth Assembly District, and D. C.
Smith addressed the meeting with old
time stirring addresses.
Tbeleagne unanimously indorsed Leon
E.Jones tor the Assembly from the Thirty
ninth District, an i M. J. Welch Jr. for
Senator for the Tweuty-third Senatorial
D. strict.
The meeting adjourned with cheers for
Hobart an i McKinley.
It is rather an odd met mat the heart of

CURRANT TO TRY
ANOTHER MOVE
His Counsel Will File an
Affidavit in a Few
Days.
This May Cause the Supreme
Court to Reconsider Its
Order.
MR. DEUPREY IS HOPEFUL.
The Voluminous Brief in Support of
Durrani's Petition Is a Joint
Production.
Counsel for W. H. T. Durrant have de
cided upon their next move. The Su
preme Court having at Los Angeles de
cided to consider the petition for a rehear
ing for Durrant without briefs the attor
neys for the defendant will, as soon as
practicable, prepare an affidavit for sub
mission to the court.
This document may be prepared within
the next few days. The intent of their
affidavit will be to show that the failure
to file briefs was unavoidable. Then tbe
court will be asked to permit the introduc
tion of the voluminous brief which has
been jointly prepared by Mr. Deuprey and
General Dickinson, which contains over
350 points, ail of which are considered by
Durrani's counsel to show valid reasons
why Durrani's case shall again be heard.
Some facts which have not been known
heretofore by the public indicate tbe
amount of labor which Durrant' s counsel
bave performed. The huge brief in sup
port of the petition for a new trial is a
joint production. Mr. Deuprey has se
lected 140 points of attack upon the pro
ceedings in the Superior Court where Dur
rant was convicted, and has elaborated
these fully. There are certain questions
or points of law which General Dickinson
especially desires to argue, and he has
marked out these points as bis share of la
bor on the brief. The first act will be the
preparation of tlie affidavit in which coun
sel for Durrant will describe the difficul
ties attending their position.
Mr. Deuprey said last night that if be
had not understood from General Dickin
son that an agreement Â»ad been reached
with Attorney-General Fitzgerald con
cerning the proceedings before the bu
preme Court at Los Angeles he would
have gone to Los Angeles. His under
standing was that tbe Durrant case would
come up at Los Angelet on the 21st inst.,
and that thereupon permission would be
granted to file briefs. Tbe affidavit pro
posed would, Mr. Deuprey thought, cure
all the misunderstandings conceruing the
matter.
"All that is necessary," said Mr. Deu
prey, "is to make an exact presentation of
all the facts to the tiupreme Court to
enable us to get tbe briefs in. I feel confi
dent that the Supreme Court, where a life
in at stake, will be liberal. So far as the
attorneys for Durrant are concerned it is
only fair to say that they have exerted
due diligence and bave made as rapid prog
ress as possible. Probably the Supreme
Court will make such order as the circum
stance-t may warrant after the affidavit of
General Dickinson and myself has been
put in."
The position of Durrant before tee
Supreme Court is this: He has asked for
the setting aside of the verdict of guilty
of murder in the first degree, which car
ried tli fa penalty of death, and also asks
for a new trial. But only the transcript
on appeal is before the court, which has
not received un/ brief for or against the
petition, nor has heard any arguments
why it should be erante i or rejected.

AN ECHO FROM SHILOH
County Treasurer Utterback Recalls Sis
Experience on the Battlefield.
. From the Nonpareil, Council Bluffs. lowa. 7 -
â  County Treasurer A. Utterback of Glen wood,
lowa, has long been one of the leading Citizens
of Mills County, and since the days of his ser
vice for the Union cause has labored industri
ously at his home in Rawls Township, with the
result that he has not only surrounded . him
self with almost a 1 the comforts heart could
wish, but lias grown into the esteem of his
iellow-men. ;. His popularity and standing,
therefore, made ' his election to the County
Tre'gurership easy. - His j work as County
Treasurer, however, was confining. ; . Coming
as he did - from an -â  active â  outdoor > life on the
farm to thecl"se and confining dutie* of the
treasurer's office, he quickly began "to: run
down in health and to visibly fail in strength
and . energy. , The Deputy Treasurer, Mr. Lon
Sawyer, is a great believer, in the efficacy of
Dr. Williams', Pink Pills. His constant advice
to : his < employer, : Mr. j Utterback, was to the
effect that he should use these pills. Finally
Mr. Utterback consented, and now after hav
ing used several boxes he is able to make the
following statement to your correspondent: "
- "Have I; used Pink Pills ? Yes. sir, and I
shall continue to use them just so long as they
benefit me as they do now. It is rarely that I
use proprietary medicines; but my deputy was
so enthusiastic over this particular medicine
that I consented to try it, and I can assure you
the benefit has been great. v., -- - " â â â ,
"I was a member oÂ£ Company F, 15th lowa
Infantry, and saw my first day's service in the
battle of Shiloh. The campaign before Corinth
and later the siege of Vicksburg wore impor
tant events in the service as seen by our com
peny, and as you cau readily imagine we were
greatly exposed and at times but poorly cared
lor during those awful days.*: Iv my case army
diarrhoea was the result. It has been the bur
den of my life a for over thirty years, but at
last I have.. found ' something - to conquer it.
The * Pink Â» Pills are a success in my case, as I
have no doubt they will be with all who will
use them." â¢*-â <. ,â ,-â  ,-^. -.--^ â ]'..,. :ii\ ... ,z=--^
The reporter afterward called upon William
Skiliicorn. the popular druggist, and, from n;m
gained :t the information that Dr. Williams'
Pink Pills have reached a most surprising sale
in this community. :". "But â¢of all * the cures,",
said the pharmacist, "that of Treasurer Utter
back is the most remarkable and, at the same
time, the most gratifying." *;= â¢ â -> , ?â¢ > â¢â >-:.<
A ] Dr. .Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are
now given to the public as I an unfailing blood
builder and nerve restorer, curing ail forms of
weakness arising from a watery condition of
the blood or. shattered nerves. The pills are
sold by all dealers, or will be sent postpaid on
receipt of price, 50 cents a box or six boxes for

Trade in September.. .
The preliminary statement of the foreign trade
of the United States for September, as prepared
by the Bureau of Statistics at Washington, is at
hand. Ihe total movement in merchandise and
produce compares as follows with tire ' correspond
ing month last year:
1895. ' 1896.
Imports $85,305,320 J50.825.705
Exp0rt5.;....... 68,540,063 85.098,594
This decrease of f 14,479.61 5 in imports and In
crease of $26,568,531 In exports account for the
better feeling which so generally prevails in busi
ness circles. Imp' rts of sold in September were
934,169,130. against 49.456 for the same month
last year, when the exports of gold exceet!Â«d the
Imports by $16,67 wnereas this year the Im
ports of gold exceeded he exports by $34,098,08 0.

< DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N.Y., Oct. 23.â R. O. Dun A Co.

'â  The event of the week has >, been the sensa lonal
advance of wheat to 83c tor cash on ' uesday, a
rise of s*^;, and its fall | to 77c on .Thursday, gain
ing 15/^coft Friday. The rise was magnified by
covering of speculative sellers who imagined* the
advanced had gone too far, but at the bottom it was
based on extraordinary foreign demand ; which has
engaged grain vessels from 5 all Pacific as well as
Atlantic " ports for months ahead. How great the
shortage in ordinary European supplies may be is
the point of doubt and speculation, but none now
question that shipments from the Pacific Coast to
India and the decrease in Russian yield tire Im
portant and the buying of the enormous quantities
for expo t with eagngements of frie.ht r om at
higher rates, ex rrssthe belief of European dealers.

COALâ A local circular says: "During the week
there have been eight arrivals from the coast col
lieries, with 19.550 tons of coal, three from Aus
tral.a with 6578 tons and three from Swansea with
7709 tons. All o. the above cargoes were placed
prior to , arrival, hence . values have not been dis
turbed by the recent literal addition to the stocks
on hand. 1 Trade generally In â  the fuel line is v.-ry
quiet,' occasioned partly by a falling off in con
sumption and partly by the anxiety on the part of
importers and joobers to force off cargo- s with
lltt.e or no profit in preference to storing them and
atval.lnz an Improvement of prices. It Is univer
sally acknowledged that Australian and English
coal freights must advance, as there ere very slim
inducements for vessels to seek this port for wheat
ding a.ter December next, as our stock of grain
remaining on hand iv January for foreign ship
ment will be very light as against the lonna in
sight to move same. â¢ Low prices tor Coal may pre
vail for three months to come, as there Is a long
list of engaged Coal tonnage from Australia at low
tretsb's; when these shall have been loaded an
advance is almost assured. - It" is very singular
that the present tempting. quotations for steam
Coals are not being more generally availed . of, as
it c.:ii be readily computed 1 how | absurdly low It Is
being transported. Where large consumers have
the space to file It up purchases now made for
early delivery will pay a remunerative interest for
buying in advance of immediate requirements."

Horn in Noah's Ark.
Hundreds of ancient gleaners of miscel
laneous curios, legends, myths and tradi
tions Â£ive us to understand that Cash was
born on the ark. Others claim that there
was a child born on the sacred vessel, bat
that it was sacrificed to one of the wild
beasts, Noah declaring that no person
should leave the arK who bad not gone on
board in the regular manner. The weight
of he evidence as; it is given by the Tal
mudic writers is to the effect that Cash: is
the person j referred ,to by the o'd-time
mystery gleaners when tbev speak of the
"ark-born" man. * The â  sacred books, as
well as ; the scores of 5 biblical encyclope
dias, handbooks â of * ancient history, : etc.,
are silent on the subject. . , '.
In I a reprint >of the ;; rare . old \ Saxon
Chronicle is found a clew to the mystery,
and another slight hint in an explanatory
note in Herbert's Nimrod. In : the Saxon
Cnronicle the following; occurs: "Bedwig
was (he son of Sheru, who was the son of
Noah, and be (Bed wig) was ' born on the
ark." Herberts. ., note ; in '. -. Nimrod, vol
ume u ll,^pase ; 37, ~{ says: â ' "Kyboic is the
ark, and. as Cash was begotten in the ark,
his posterity were, in a peculiar sense, de
scended 5 ; from that ship." Although Her
bert made no direct reference to the fact
of Cush being.actually born in the ark, he
speaks of him in several places as "Cush,
the ark born." r . The Talmudic writers dis
credit the Bedwig story, but declare that
Cush was born on the -day that "God's
covenant" (the rainbow) first appeared. â

Some Minor Changes Made
Since the Game With

Manager Ewing Announces His
Line-Up for the Big

PREPARED FOR A HARD FIGHT
Great Things Exp-cted of Young
Arlett, the Reliance Full
back.
Oakland Office San Frakcjsco Call,)
â  903 Broadway, Oct. 23. j
The Reliance football team is prepared
â¢ to struggle hard for supremacy when It
meets Stanford University at Central Park
to-morrow afternoon. Manager Cal Ewing
completed his line-up to-day.
"â¢ There will be some changes from the
; Ernest Dash, Reliance Qub's Right
Tackle.
line-up when the team played three weeks
ago. Dorsch, the old Multnomah tackle,
. will take Middlemas' place as right tacfcle.
â¢ La Cunha of Haywards will play left end
â  . in place of Racine. The center will be
" held down by three of the be3t men on
the coast, Burnett at center, with Wells
and Oliver as guards.
' Sexton, who is well known as a left
.^ tackle over the coast, will take the same
position to-morrow. Lanyon, who plays
right end, has been placed on account of
his hard low tackling and following the
ball.
Marsh, the quarter-back, is a plucky
little player, who is always in the game.
' He is especially strong in defensive play
and puts up a great game at quarter.
Back of the line will seen the same trio
as that which played into the Berkeley
line so successfully a few weeks ago.
Arthur Arlett at fullback is improving
â¢very day. He is considered a very
â¢ promiping player and his determined line
bucking and dashing play is sure to place
. â¢ him in the front rank as a fullback. Car
ter and Walton are both fast men and sure
.. ground-gainers.
"Taken as a whoie," said Manager Cal
Ewing to-day, "the msjterial in the Re
liance team is exceptionally good, and
with careful training a fine team can be
turned ont. As has been the experience
; before, it is very difficult to get a second
â  eleven out to practice regularly against
the regular team, and this of course
'. ' operates against perfect team work.
"Of course we feel confident that we can
.'â  hold our own to-morrow, but we are not
making any prophecies, as the Stanford
boys are a strong set of players. I under-
L. Newcombe, Tackle.
â stand that they have been training and
practicing vigorously, and if that be true
there will be a lively contest."
Misleading Signs. ;

FOOTBALL MEN AT WORK
Berkeley Players Housed in
Their New Training
Quarters.
Cbanges Made ia the Schedule of
Games for the Clubs Around
the Bay.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Oct. 23 âThe past
week in football circles has been full of
interest. Flushed with the victory of
last Saturday over the Olympics, the men
went at their work on Monday with still
more vim and energy.
The two events of the week were the
opening of the training-house and the
practice game with the Reliance Ciub team
last evening. On Tuesday twenty men
took up their quarters at the training
house on Union street, and at once com
menced to observe the strictest rules re
garding diet, sleep and non-dissipation.
Following are the men who have been
assigned to the trainiug-nouse: Kansome,
Sherman, Simpson, Craig, McD&rmott,
Ludlow, Birdsall, Greisberg, Hopper,
Hutchinson, Dickie, Bender, Haskell,
Kennedy, Whipple, Anderson, McNutt
and Hall. In all probability half a dozen
more will bo ordered to the quarters dur
ing the coming week.
The practice game with ths Reliance
last evening, in whicrh the men from Oak
land carried the ball down the field over
BerKeley's line seven or eight times,
showed that more concerted work must be
done by the coliejrians in strengthtning
j that portion of the team.
Freshmen players, as at Stanford, this
i year are at a premium. There are barely
j enoujrh competent " '00" men at Berkeley
I to make up a team. Their first same of
i the season will be played with the Bel
; mont team to-morrow morning on the
: Berkeley field. Following will be the line
j up: McDermott, center; Barnes and
| Peck, guards; Riley and Miner, tackles;
i Alien and Sinytue, ends; Symmes and
j Whipple, or Dickie, halves; Austin, quar
-1 ter; Anderson, full.
The schedule of games for the season
between the various clubs about the bay
! has been revised. Following are the dates
i of games since the change has been made:
Reliance - Stanford, to-morrow afternoon;
Olympic-Stanford, October 31; Berkeley-Re
liance, November 3 (election day); Berkeley-
Molera '99, Center.
Stanford, freshman game, November 7; Olym
pic-Reliance, November 14.
More Drill for Students.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 23.-Drill five
times a week is to be the order for fresh
men at the university beginning with
next month. After the Ist of November
the freshmen will be turned over, to the
"war department" during the time on
Monday morning that is now devoted to
gymnasium work. The change is to al
low the 1900 men to make up for the time
they have lost in the study of the manual
of arms by reason of their having drilled
without guns during the past three
months.
Long light Ended.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 23.â The long
standing difficulty of Mrs. Mary A.
Townsend over the plat of unmacadam
iÂ£ed â  street on Sbattuck avenue, near
Channin* way, is now in a fair way to be
settled. Town Attorney ! Hayne has ex
pressed the opinion that the disputed bit of
land is in fact a public street, having been
used as such without protest for five years,
aDd the Trustees will at once order it to be
macadamized.

THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1896.
MINISTERS FAR
FROM HARMONY
Rev. Dr. Wendte's Magic-
Lantern Slides Enter the
Controversy.
Rev. J. E. Bushnell, Lutheran,
Defends the Position of the
Unitarian.
RIV. DB. M'LEAN LED THE WAY.
It Was He Who First Proposed the
Union Celebration of Lather's
Day.
Oaklard Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 23. i
The action of the official board of the
First Methodist Church in instructing
Rev. Dr. Kummer and the church choir
to refrain from participating in the union
Lutheran festival next Saturday night at
the Exposition Hall has created much
feeling among other ministers. The as
sertion that Rev. C. W. Wendte, D. D.,
was given too prominent a place on the
programme to suit certain evangelical
ministers is scouted as absurd. It is re
called that a few months ago Dr. Kum
mer borrowed some slides from Dr.
Wendte to illustrate his (Eummer'a)
travels in Europe. Dr. Wendte complied
readily and did not object to allowing his
"Unitarian" slides to be exhibited for
Methodist benefit, and he is somewhat
surprised that any objection should be
raised when he appears with his slides at
a Lutheran celebration.
Rev. J. E. Bushnell, pastor of the First
English Lutheran Church, is greatly Bur-
GEORGE W. LANGAN, Chairman of the General Committee of
Arrangements of the Republican Barbecue to Be Held at
Haywards To-Day.
prised at the attitude of the First Metho
dist Church.
"The first suggestion regarding the
union Lutheran festival," said Key. J. E.
Bushnell to-day, "was made not by myself
but by my distinguished friend, Rev. Dr.
McLean, who presided at the meeting.
He gave due credit to Rev. C. W. W^endte
for the oripinal proposal and cailed upon
film to speak. When asked for my views
I expressed a disposition to concur and
co-operate cheerfully, since this service
was in Keeping with "the recognized usage
of the Lutheran church cf which I am a
| astor. At a meeting of the committee
appointed as you report the utmost har
mony prevailed and each member vied
with the other in a desire to have all the
churches represented. A programme was
arranged, based upon assured co-opera
tion. This was reported to the union last
month, and then certain pastors who were
conspicuous lor their former absence pre
sented objections to riunday evening as a
time and the Tabernacle as a place. To
Buit these expressed objections I moved
that the service be held Saturday, as this
was approved oy Dr. Kunimer, who cor
dially seconded the motion. As a finai
conclusion the whole matter was placed
again in the hands of the committee, with
full power to act.
"This committee met, Dr. Coyle being
chairman, and the Rev. Mr. Brown of the
Congregational church, who iiad not been
able to understand about the matter, was
present by invitation. Mr. Wendte was
not even present. Then a most harmoni
ous agreement way reached in favor of
holding the service in the Congregational
church, which Dr. Kummer himself had
seconded, and it was agreed that he
should speak with others. It is but fair to
Mr. Wendte to say that the marked cour
tesy which he has shown in the whole
matter was expressed in a note when in
formed by the secretary, Rev. Owen Jones,
as to the charges made. He expressed his
disposition to co-operate and also ex
plained that illness prevented his atten
dance. I have this cordial note before me.
This much in reply to the statement that
the 'executive committee placed Rev. Mr.
Wendte in charge of the programme as
he bad shown so much enthusiasm.'
'â The programme supplied to you is not
the one which the committee has pre
pared for publication, and it is not correct
for Dr. Kummer or any one else to infer
that 'too much prominence' was given' to
any one minister.
"I do not need to champion any one in
this discussion, but rather express the
hope that the Luther service will, as was
intended, promote good fellowship among
all lovers of religious and civil liberty
without prejudice or preferment."
Rev. Dr. Wendte will i.andle the deli
cate subject from his pulpit on Sunday
morning.
Republicans Parade.
OAKLAND, Cal, Oct. 23.â The Repub
licans held the largest parade of the cam
paign this evening and ended with a
crowded mass-meeting at the Tabernacle.
Tne alliance led and was followed by the
Army and Navy Republican League, the
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
Young Men's Republican Club in uniform,
the Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Assem
bly districts and the Sixth Ward clubs,
ah in u;iiform, and the Italian Kepubli
can Club of Temescal, besides a number
of mounted aids and a lar^e number of
members of the Sound-money League.
Fire was plentiful and bands weie numer
ous, and the parade excelled anything
that has yet been seen.
The chief speakers at the Tabernacle
were Hon. Irving M. Scott and General
Hart. Mr. Scott's address was particu
larly practical and convincing, and, com,
ing as it did irom a man of authority in
the industrial worid, it created a profound
impression.
Tote in a Tent.
OAKLAND. Cal., Oct. 23â 0 win* to
Hie inability of Supervisor Johnston to
secure a room for a pollin -place in the
Second Precinct of the Third Ward, he se
cured a tent and erected it on the vacant

AVheatley Is Wanted.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 23. â A large
number of creditors are anxious to know
the whereabouts of C. A. WheatUy, who

READY FOR THE BARBECUE
Thousands of People Will Flock to
Haywarda This Morning.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 23.â The arrange
ments for the grand Republican barbecue
at Haywards to-morrow were completed
to-day. It will last from about 11 o'clock
to 2 p. m., and arrangements are being
made to take care of all who will attend.
The pita for the roasting of the beeves
have been dug, and very complete ar
rangements have been made for the clam
bake.
The speakers will be General W. H. L.
Barnes, Congressman Hilborn, D. E. Mc-
Kinlay. James W. Clark and some county
candidates. As the crowd will be an
enormous one it is probable that there
will be two or three meetings conducted
at once.
The committee on arrangements have
invited all the Republican organizations,
and there has been a very hearty response.
The Army and Navy Republican League
of Oakland will attend in full, and this
alone means a muster of 500. There will
be a fine parade and fireworks without
stint at night. : .
Halt rates will be charged by the electric
road, which will run several special trains.
The Southern Pacific has issued a notice
that only a fare and a third will be charged
from all points to Hay wards for return
tickets.

GAVE BEER TO A CHILD.
Her Brother Will Petition the Trustee*
to Revoke a Saloon License.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 23.â X. &. Full
mer says he will tile a petition with the
Board of Trustees next Monday evening
asking them to revoke the liquor license
of Andrew Frank at 1253 Park street In
support of this request he will file an
atlidavit setting forth that Frank sold or
gave liquor to Clara Fallmer, his 15
--year-old sister and daughter of Rudolph
Fallmei of 1920 Union street.
Women at War.
ALAMEDA, Cal. ? Oct. 23.â The Political
Equality Club is rejoicing over the with
drawal of the Alumeda auxiliary of the
Women's Suffrage Association from the
field of politics. The abandonment of the
meeting advertised for next Monday night
by the auxiliary is the outcomo of one
woman power, say their opponents. Mrs.
1. N. Chapman of the Political Equality
Club said in regard to the affair:
"We started in this tight first and Mrs.
Babcock tried to run things, and so their
side julled out when they found she could
not have her way. We do not propose
to drop the good work we are doing, and
shall hold another meeting before elec
tion."
Mrs. Olive B. Babcock was seen at her
home, 2615 Ban Jose avenue, but denied
at first that there was any trouble. She
said: "Anything we attempt to do the
Equality Club tries to break up. When
we were arranging for our Leona Heights
Admission day celebration they secured
our speakers â Miss Anthony and Miss
Shaw. We were to hold a Republican
meeting Monday, and this stirred up the
Populists, and now we cannot get any
speakers. I am a politician myself, and
can see a situation when there is one."
Train With Gates.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 23.â The gates
on the local broad-gauge trains were
operated yesterday afternoon, beginning
with the 2 o'clock run. A full comple
ment of gatemen attended the train, but
no effort was made to collect fares or com
pel passengers to show tickets. The
Board of Trustees will pass an ordinance
compelling the company to place a flag
man at every crossing at its first meeting
after fare ia charged or tickets requested.
Kncinal City Motes.
The Bryanites held a rally to-night, pre

participated.
THE PEOPLE El '
AT RAINEY'S YARN
Merriment Over the Story
That He Helped Un
known Men.
Politicians Puzzled by the Action
of the Warm Springs
Sage.
DOUBTS AS TO THE EFFECT.
His Support of Mr. Phelan May Drive
Other Voters to Opposing
Candidates.
A broad grin overspread the political
face of San Francisco yesterday as soon as
the people read the remarkable state
ments made by Mr. Samuel Rainey, indi
cating that he is in the habit of support
ing candidates for office without expect
ing them to do anything for him in re
turn.
That !waa a startling story of Mr.
Rainey's, that he had elected three Demo
cratic Supervisors without having spoken
to them before their election, that he had
to introduce himself to Joe Dimond at the
racetrack after the election, and that one
of the trio is still wandering among the
political labyrinths of San Francisco seek
ing an introduction to Mr. Rainey and
mourning because he has it not,
Two theories were prevalent among
those who have been in the habit of study
ing Mr. Rainey's political tactics. One
was that Mr. Kainey is really opposed to
Mr. Phelan and hoped to hurt his chances
of success by pretending to give him a
noisy Bupport, but which in fact would
exhaust itself in declamation, while the
real inside and effective work of his ma
c hine will be given to Mr. Dimond, the
Anti- Charter Democratic nominee. It was
held in some quarters that Mr. Rainey's
open advocacy of Mr. Phelan's cause
would be a detriment rather than a help
to that gentleman.
Another theory was that Mr. Rainey is
actually sincere in his proclamation of
fealty to Mr. Phelan, and that he expects
to attract that gentleman's attention by
newspaper interviews, with a hope for
some kind of recognition in the event of
Mr. Phelan's election. It was argued that
Mr. Rainey, in the natural course of po
litical affairs, must be nearer to Mr. Pne
lan than to any other candidate, and that
he would be able to bring more, influence
to bear in tbat direction than in any
other. If he has anything to hope it must
be from Mr. Phelan, for it must be re
membered that Mr. Phelan was nomi
nated by the Junta convention, of which
Mr. Rainey was the ab-soiute boss from
beginning to end. There may have been
a slight aberration caused by the interjec
tion of Mr. Reynolds into the temporary
chairmanship, but it was not of sufficient
magnitude to jostle Mr. Rainey from his
mastery of the convention.
Another idea is that Mr. Rniney prefers
to be associated in the public mind with
Mr. Phelan's candidacy rather than with
that of any other nominee in the field, and
that he would expect to rely on his ac
knowledged ability to "manage" certain
members of the Board of Supervisors in
case he should ask for "recognition" in
municipal affairs hereafter.
Whatever view may be taken of Mr.
Rainey's pronunciamento it must be ac
knowledged by those who watch the cur
rent of events that bis action will not be
without effect on the result of the election.
His open advocacy of Mr. Phelan will
cause some others to antagonize him.
It would be but fair for him to yield a
genuine support to the nominee to whose
cause he is ostensibly devoted, and if his
sincerity is distrusted he has himself and
his past record for seltish motives to
blame.
It is expected, however, ihat all the
charitable institutions, hospitals, kinder
gartens and such organizations, learning
of the sudden enlargement of Mr. Rainey's
heart and bis determination to devote
himself to unselfish and disinterested acts,
will take his talk in earnest and flood him
with applications for all kinds of contribu
tions. If they do it may result in wreck
ing ;he Warm Bprings establishment that
Mr. Rainey lias built up by years of pa
tient economy and thrift. â¢
Democrats at Union Hall.
An enthusiastic Democratic meeting
was held in Union Hall, near the corner
of Howard and Third streets, last evening.
Among the speakers were James D.
Ptieian, James H. Barry and M. C. Has
sett. Mr. Barry was introduced as a
gentleman who did not always agree with
the Democracy of this City, Dut was a good
fellow notwithstanding, and in the main
was all right. This was received with ap
proving applause, and the speaker cor
roborated the chairman by saying impar
tially that out of all the nominating
conventions of San Francisco not one was
a convention of the people. They were all
boss- ridden and boss-led. Albeit it was a
Democratic meeting, the sentiment was
concurred in unanimously.
FAIR'S HEIRS COMBINE,
They Will Join Forces to Fight
the Probate of the Pencil
Will.
The attorneys representing the heirs in
the Fair case met in Judge Slack's cham
bers yesterday to discuss the amount to
be allowed ex-Judge Van R. Paterson for
services as attorney for Herman Oeirichs
Jr. and other minor heirs of the deceased
capitalist.
Judge Paterson asked for remuneration
for legal services and that he be reim
bursed for money expended. It was
agreed that he receive the former, but his
Honor denied the latter request. The
amount Judge Paterson will receive will
be announced on Wednesday night.
The meeting was productive also of a
thorough understanding between the
smail army of attorneys who represent
the Fair children, the grandchildren and,
in fact, all the lawyers, excepting the ad
vocates of the pencil will. Attorney
Wheeler, representing Virginia Fair and
Mrs. Oeirichs, announced that at the
proper time his clients will ba found fol
lowing the banner of the contestants of
the pencil will. For the present, however,
they will file no contest, but will stand
with Judge Paterson in tne contest insti
tuted in behalf of the minor heirs.

GRAND JURY SETS
DAMOCLES' SWORD
Indictments Hanging Over
Public and Private
Enemies.
Two of Judge Hebbard's Oppo*
cents Are Accused of
Libel.
SPURIOUS ELECTION PETITIONS
The Jury Will Go Into Court This
Morning and Present a
Report.
The Grand Jury was full of business
yesterday afternoon. The session lasted
from 2 until 6 o'clock. Inquiry was re
sumed relating to boeus signatures to
election documents. Registrar Hinton
Buspected that many spurious names were
attached to petitions asking that certain
candidates be placed on the official ballot,
and so the matter was sent to the Grand
Jury by Garret McEnerney, attorney of the
Registrar. The investigation began Friday
of last week. When it was resumed yes
terday thirty or more witnesses were in
waiting.
Testimony elicited by the Grand Jury
clearly established the fact that many of
the signatures were forged. Many wit
nesses whose names were enrolled testified
that they never signed the documents
purporting to bear their signatures. In
some instances they swore they had
signed one petition, but that they had not
signed more than one, yet their names, in
some cases cleverly counterfeited, ap
peared on others. The witnesses came
from South San Francisco, North Beach
and the central precincts of the City.
A. J. Henry, notary public, 628 Market
street, before whom Paul A. Ayhens made
affidavit that all the signatures on one pe
tition were genuine, was a witness.
E. KeMy, notary, 213 Sansome street, be
fore whom P. A. Dolan made affidavit
that all the signatures on another petition
were genuine, also testified. The penalty
under the law for accepting spurious sig
natures and representing under oath that
they are genuine is five years'imprison
ment in the penitentiary.
It is not definitely known what indict
ments the Grand Jury has agreed upon,
but the jury will meet to-day and submit
some indictments to Superior Judge Slack.
Gossip goes at the City Hall that some
hasty departures for Canada may be made
within the next twenty-four hours.
Another important case was considered
at the session yesterday. There were re
cently printed and circulated many thou
sand copies of a circular entitled, "What
the Rer>resentativps of the Swindled De
positors of the P ople's Home Savings
Bank Think of J. C. B. Hebbard. Sub
stantfal Reasons Why He Should Not Be
Re-elected Superior Court Judge of the
City and County of San Francisco." The
circular purports to emanate from T.
H. McCarthy, E. F. Kendall, Thomas S.
Williams Jr., George B. Conant, Benja
min Lucy, A. L. Ca^avaro and F. H. Qual
man, People's Home Savings Bank de
positors.
Julius Kahn and John Curtin were the
first witnesses examined. The next wit
ness called was E. F. Kendall, who is in
the employ of W r ells, Fargo & Co. He
testified that he signed the circular under
a misapprehension as to its contents. Tne
language of the circular reflects on the
judiciai integrity of Judge Hebbard and
complaint is therefore made tnat it is
libelous.
It transpires that T. H. McCarthy, a
schoolteacher, and Thomas S. Williams
Jr. are the persons complained of, and
should indictments for libel be found in
the case they will be the accused.
The Grand Jury will meet at 10 o'clock
this morning to fndict somebody.
The circular which is said to be libelous
is headed "An Appeal to Voters." The
first paragraph is as follows:
Your attention is called to the fact that an
unfair and therefore unfit personâ J. C. B.
Hebbardâ solicits your baliot for the position
of Superior Judge at the approaching election.
We cannot longer remain silent, since a sensa
tioiml newspaper has repeatedly misrepre
sented facts during the past few weeks by stat
ing- opposition to Uebbard came trom persons
who wanted to loot the People's Home Savings
Bank, when the truth la that those who object
io him are the untortunate depositors who
suffered by the looting.
Two pages of the Circular are devoted to
a review of the proceedings in court re
lating to the insolvency of the bank and
the meetings of the board of directors.
The Circular says:
The existing board had been prohibited
from meeting for any purpose whatever by
Judge Hebbsrd. The committee secured the
promise of a majority of the board to resign.
Judge Hebbard ajrreed that they might meet
for the purpose of resigning. The next day
the Judtte hnd chanped his mind. Why? Be
cause the men of character selected by the
depositors for the vacancies were not satisfac
tory to Hebbard's bosom friend, the notorious
James Alva Watt, who desired to be the attor
ney and real manager of the bank.
The circular also attacks Judge Heb
bard for appointing John F. Sheehan re
ceiver, and c arges that the Jud-;e sub
sequently discharged the receiver and his
bondsmen without a proper accounting
to the court.
The libelous circular bears no imprint
of a publisher, but it is said that the
friends of Judge Hebbard will not only
ascertain the name of the printer, but also
the name of the person or corporation
that is spending a large sum of money in
sending a copy of the document to each
voter in the City.
BUILDERS' BANQUET.
The Committee Making; Arrangements
for the Sixth Annual Festival.
The members of the Builders' Exchange
will assemole round the festive board this
evening at the rooms of the exchange on
New Montgomery street. To make suita
ble preparations for this, their sixth an
nual gathering, a committee consisting of
the secretary of the exchange James A.
Wilson, Thomas Eiam and M. C. Lynch
have been appointed.
The society, known as the "Builders'
Exchange," was incorporated on the 3d of
July, 1890, with C. C. TerriJl as president,
W. N. Miller vice-president, M. J. Dono
van secretary and A. W. Starbird treas
urer.
The number of members at first was
small, but tne importance of the society
became so manifest to all engaged in the
building trade and supplying of material
that a steady increase was at once per
ceptible. So muc so that the Montgom
ery-street headquarters, the original place
where the members had their place of
meeting, became too small.
A change of quarters was taken to rooms
on Post street, between Montgomery and
Kearny, but here again the complaining
public and the police caused another shift
ing of quarters, until the present location
waÂ» found, where the society is at peace
with the outside world and as a conse
quence the members feel content and
happy.
The present officers are: Oscar Lewis
president; O. E. Brady, vice-president; L.
3. Sibley, treasurer, and James A. Wilson
Becretary. There are about 350 members
all of whom are in some manner con
nected with the building industry of the
City.
FIGHT ON A ROOF.
President McGrath of the Metal-Roofers'
Union Struck by Frank B.
Oibgon.
The Pacific Sheet Metal Workt Com
pany are putting on a roof at the Prot
estant Orphan Asylum on Haight street,
near La una, and have fifteen non-union
men employed on the job.
The Metal-roofers' Union held a meet
ing Thursday morning and appointed a
committee of three to go to the asylum
and use its influence with the foreman not
to employ non-union men. President John
T. McGrath decided, however, that he
would go himself instead of the committee.
He went out to the asylum and climbed
to the roof. He ordered the men to
stop work, and the foreman, Frank B.
Gibson, asked him, "Who are you?"
McGrath explained the object of bis mis
sion, and Gibson gave him a minute to
get off the roof. McGrath refu-ed to go,
and Gibson struck him a blow on the jaw
that nearly knocked him off tlie roof. It
was a fortunate thing for McGrain that
the roof was flat, otherwise he would have
measured his length on the ground.
McGrath made his way to Judge Camp
bell's court and svrore .to a complaint
charging Gbson with battery. The war
rant was served by Policeman S. Camp
bell and Gibson was released on bis own
recognizance by Judge Campbell ana re
turned 10 the job.
DIVORCE COURTS.
Hattie Â£. Kennedy Divorced From
Lumber-Dealer Kennedy for
Cruelty.
Judge Troutt yesterday granted Hattie
E. Kennedy a divorce from Albert W.
Kennedy, the lumber merchant, who is a
member of the firm of Kennedy A Shaw.
Mrs. Kennedy testified that her hus
band has on a number of occasions cursed
and abused her, once throwing a hot
oyster loaf at her head. Another time,
she said, he tried to throw her out of a
window. She also accused him of having
been unfaithful and named one Trixey
Marshall as co-respondent.
Judge Troutt granted Mrs. Kennedy $50
per month alimony, the custody of her
child and connsei fees.
SUPERVISORS IN EREOR
Resolution Rescinding a Privi
lege Exempts the Railway
Company.
Panhandle Fere s May Go, but the
Stanyan-S rt-et Depot Esrncade
Must R main
When the Superintendent of Streets
begins to remove the fences at Golden
Gate Park he will meet with opposition
from a source that was not considered last
Monday when the Board of Supervisors
gave him power and directions to proceed
with this work. And it is likely that he
will have to leave his task unfinished and
wait either for a new resolution to be
passed or for the courts to give him
authority to act.
At the instiga'ion of some property
owners in the vicinity oi Golden Gate
Park a resolution was adopted by the
Supervisors last Monday as follows:
Resolution No. 15,168 (third series)â
Resolved, That that portion of resolution No.
14,605 (new series), which (fives the Park
Commissioners the privilege of extending the
fences 01 Golden Gate; Park to the outer line of
the sidewalks on Oak, Fell, .Stan van, Fulton, D
and H streets, be and the same is hereby re
scinded, and the Superintendent of Public
Streets, Highways Â«nd Squares is hereby di
rected 10 remove all fences that have been put
up nndersaid iesolution No. 14,605 'new
series).
According to this resolution it would
seem that the park encroaches on streets
surrounding the "panhandle" and skirt
ing the park on three sides,' as far as the
curb line. Such is not the case, however,
excepting on Fell and OaK streets, where
sidewalks are supplanted by beautitul
pathways inside ihe lence among flower
ing and sweet-smelling shrubs. On the
other streets mentioned â Stanyan, D and
H streetsâ the park line does not encroach
on the sireets. So the only effect this new
resolution will have is to narrow the mag
nificent "panhandle," and. in so doing
destroy numerous beautiful pines, cypress,
eucalypti and pretty . hedgerows. And
this is all because an oversight was made
by the petitioners lor the alteration de
sired. .
The resolution was especially intended
to include the Park and Ocean Beach Rail
way depot at the Haight-street entrance
to Golden Gate Park. This has been an
eyesore and a -source of continual agita
tion among property-owners and resi
dents of Ash bury Heights lor two or thre
years. What was most particularly ob
jected to was a high fence ; outside the de
pot along the westerly curb line on Stan
yan street for the distance of one block
south of Haight street. Inside this fence
the railway . monopolized the sidewalk,
and pedestrians â  have had : to cross the
street at the depot to find a level and clean
foothpath along Stanyan street. The
fences along the panhandle are: not to be
compared with this obstruction, so far as
the residents out there are concernedâ a
fact which was entirely overlooked in
framing the 'â â ; rescinding resolution â
though this same barricade is still pre
served from the ax of the Street Superin
tendent. A :
This i* how the error was made: Reso
lution 14,605 (new series), which has been
rescinded, gave the Park Commissioners
permission to extend the fences on Fell,
Oak, Baker, r Stanyan, Fulton, D and H
streets out to the curbline. It was adopted
April 19, 1880, but, the Commissioners did
not lake advantage of the grant in its en
tirety. The railway company got special
permission from the Board of Supervisors
to take the ; sidewalk for its depot on
Stanyan street, 7 and then :; ; appropriated
that portion of the street to its own exclu
sive useÂ»,by fencing it against the public.
For years people had to pay their nickels
to get inside : this same : barricade, which
still stands and will continue to stand lor
some time, because, under the present res
olution, it cannot be moved.

SUISUN SLOUGHS
WILL BE OPENED
Government Officials De
clare the Blockade
Unlawful.
President Kellogg of the Corde
lia Club Voices His
Thoughts.
JUSTIFIES THE OBSTRUCTION!
Calls It a Qutst on of Prop?rty
Rights Privileging Owners to
Keep Others Off.
Assistant "United States District Attor
ney Knight, acting under the advice of
Government engineers, wired the Attor
ney-General at Washington, D. C, yester
day, that Franfc Horan slough in the
Suisun marshes is navigable. This will
pretty nearly settle the disturbing ques
tion of wheiher local sportsmen can or
cannot shoot in the sloughs, which the
Cordelia Club contend are not navigable.
Apropos of the question, Charles L. Kel
logg, president of the club, gave his views
yesterday as follows:
"There is only one question, it seems to
me, involved in the matier, and that is
that this tract of land in the Suisun
marsh in Solano County belongs to the
Chamberlain heirs, for which they have a
deed from the State showing that the land
was sold under the tide land act some
where in 1861 or 1862. They have a perfect
title to the property, and the land is as
sessed by the State and by the county, the
taxes last year amounting to something
between $400 and $500.
"I have 'a lease from these persons for
this land for shooting purposes, which,
outside the small amount they tret from
Pierce Bros, for pasturing purposes, is ihe
only revenue they have from the land
with which to pay taxes; so that if the
right of leasing this land were taken away
from them, which it certainly would be if
to evsry one were conceded the right of
shooting thereon, it would amoint simply
to a confiscation of "heir property â some
thing we claim neither ii c Legislature nor
any other body has the right to do.
"We first instituted proceedings for tres
pass upon tlifc land, bad several persons
tried, they demandine a jury trial, and on
account of the prejudice in the county
against the preserve system no convictions
were had. We men applied to Judge
Buckles for an injunction in the Superior
Court, and Judee Buckles granted n tem
porary injunction, but in the iiearing of
tlie case declared in favor of the poachers
â for that is what tliey were.
"Then we made an appeal from that
court to the Supreme Court, which re
vers d his decision in almost every par
ticular, and the matter will come up
before him again on the 27th inst.. when 1
do not see how he can avoid issuing a per
manent injunction under the plain orders
oi the Supreme Court.
"It seems to me lhat it is only a ques
tion ot property rightâ whether a man
having a perfpcttitle to property has the
right to keep people off or not. In regard
to the sloushs bein^: navigable and the
obstructions placed there, the intention is
merely to keep people from coming in.
Our attorneys sÂ»ay that the waters are not
navigable, never having been used for
that purpose at any time. The fact that
the railroad companies huve trestles
across the sloughs that huve been ob
structed shows that they do not consider
them navigable streams; otherwise they
would have built drawbridges, in accord
ance with the law.
"The stream which the Sportsmen's
Prohibitive Association and others com
plain moatiy about, cailed the Frank
Hnran, is a Draoch of the Cordelia Slough,
but begins and terminates in the land of
the Chamberlain trart. Therefore, the
only u^e to which it could be piu would
be to travel back and forth upon the land.
"It is our desire to have it determined
by the United States authorities wheiher
or not the stream is navigable, we claim
ing that it is not Wo care under no cir
cumstances to violate the law."

MYSTERIOUS RAPS
BY THE UNSEEN
Shotwell Street Said to
Have a House That Is
Haunted.
A Friendly Spook That Calls on
Neighbors Once in a
While.
THE SOUNDS OF FOOTSTEPS.
Once a Tall E'derly Man Appeared in
Ibe House of a Lady Who Had a
Sick Cbild.
There are strange stories afloat in the
Mission in the vicinity of Folsom and
Twenty-second streets, stories such as are
frequently told by the light of a bright,
open fireplace on long winter evenings,
when the sounds of the storm are heard
on the outside and cause the listeners to
shiver and apprehensively glance to the
The House on Shotwell Street That Has the People Thereabouts
Gossiping About Uncanny Things.
back of the room where the shadows
caused by the firelight are fitfully play
ing. The local story is that of a haunted
house on Shotwell street, where strange
and uncanny things are said to happen at
times.
The house which is the subject of gossip
is in the vicinity of Twenty-first street.
It is an old one-story and a basement
structure, with a wide porch in front and
a lot of trees in the rear. A wide passage
way leads from the street to a large yard
in front of the house in question. A sig
nificant "To Let" sign projects over the
sidewalk above a broken gate.
All of the neighbors have beard of tht
mysterious noises and of the apparition!
that have at times trespassed into the
reaim of everyday lite. Yet these peoplt
are loth to du-cuss .such matters for feai
that they might be considered supersti
tious or timid. However the good house
wives thereabout do discuss t' ese matter!
oh the quiet ana comment upon the fact
that those who hay** rented the house
have not always remained there very long.
This may be because there is a stable neai
by and that the horses' hoofs disturb theii
slumbers, or because the bouse is not oi
modern construction. Be this so or noi
the house has been occupied many time:
and vacant many times, and now the
landlord is fixing it up for his own use.
The first time that the supernatural evei
intruded upon the natural was several
years azo, so the story goes. One night
one of tne occupants of the bouse heard
distinctly the footfails of a large man
walking up the front stairs, which was
followed by a loud knock upon the door.
The woman, lamp in hand, looked out on
the porch and into the yard. No one was in
sight. A little later this was repeated at
the back door with the same results â nc
one in sight. On another occasion some
thing like a scuffle in an adjoinine room
was heard. The next day an express
waeon stood in front of the house and a
"to let" sign appeared at the front gate,
Probably the most startling experience
was that of Mrs. Zimmer, who lived at
2244 Folsom street, the small backyard oi
which adjoins the house in question. Tc
a friend she told the following story:
"One evening my little daughter was ill
and as I was crossing the floor I heard
some one cross the back yard from the
direction of 'hat house, although no om
rould cliiijb over the high fences. My
door was ajar, but I did not close it, and
to my surprise a second later I saw tbÂ«
figure of a very tall man dressed in a long

door. His right hand was over his head
and his elbow against the doorjamb sup
ported the body. His face was white
except where covered by a long beard, and
I noticed that he wore an old-fashioned
low-cu dress vest. I was startled, but I
managed to ask, 'W at do you want?'
He smiled and walked, or rather glided
over to the bed, where my daughter was
asleep. He reclined beside her on the bed
and I cried, 'If you come for good or evil,
go.'
"He arose and glided noiselessly to the
back door, and a second later I neard
sounds like the tramp of a large man
gome down the stairs. There were some
coops of poultry in my yard, and the fowls
set up a terrible noise, but above thejracket
I could hear the sound of the footsteps
going toward that house. Several times
while in the basement my lamp wasblowu
out, althouzh not a breath of air was mov
ing, and this was followed by the sound
of retreating footsteps going to that
house."
Mrs. Zimmer moved across the bay, and
is no longer troubled by mysterious visit
ors or the sounds of footfalls.
Among the recent occupants of the
house was J. Paul and his family, who
make oilcloth goods on Twenty-second
street, below Folsom. Mrs. Paul smiled
knowingly when spoken to about the
premises, and said that she never saw a
ghost during the time she lived there, but
she had heard the stories that were going
the rounds. Mrs. Paul was not desirous
of discussing the ghost feature of the af
fair, nor wouid she tell why during all the
time she lived there she kept several
lights burning all night.
For some time past the uncanny mani
festations have not been noticed, as no one
lived in the house, but no sooner did the
landlord begin to repair the premises than
tbe spook began to strike up an acquaint
ance with his neighbors. A few nights
ago a lady living in one of the houses in
the row "where Mrs. Zimmer formerly re
sided was busy late at night in the kitchen,
when she heard the sound of footsteps
| crossing the little yard from the direction
i of the Sliotwell-street house, although no
one could enter the yard.
Stop by step the visitor mounted the
stairs, and a loud knock on the kitchen
door followed. The lady quickly threw
open the door. The light from the lamp
instantly fell halfway across the yard, but
no one wasln sight. As soon as the door
was dosed the sound of retreating foot
steps was heard goiue in tbe direction of
that house. Twice has this occurred, and
j it is said that there will be more 'To let"
I sijins up in that neighborhood soon.
All this may be the stamping of the
borses in the stable around the corner, or
the scampering of cats and rats, but what
ever they may be the disturbances are
productive of the "creeps" to timid
people. * ' ...
EVILS OF A GREAT CITY.
Rabbi Voorsanger Speaks on
San Francisco's Bridge
of Sighs.
Educational Force, as a Means to Raise
Vie ous Personality, a Reform
Measure.
Rabbi Voorsanger delivered a lecture
last night in the Temple Emanu El on
'â¢The Evils of a Great City and How to
Correct Them."
He said that any man who travels east
erly 011 Bush street toward the bay actually
passes what Thomas Hood calls the
Bridge of Sighs.
The Bridge of Sighs suggested the pas
sage from good to evil, the possibility of
traveling from one moral zone to another.
"We are compelled to realize its exist
ence," said Dr. Voorsanger, referring to
vice, "and we cannot by any manner of
means legislate it out of existence. We
must deal with it mercifully, we must
deal with it kindly, we must deal with it
with common sense. Men and women
both are prone to it; man's honor is no
creater strength than woman's purity.
They who are most helpless deserve most
to be helped; they who sin most have
most to learn. It is not all viciousness
ro, not even in the gilded palaces- it is
not all sin. There is to be told a melan
choly tale of iost opportunities and weak
ness, a tale of poverty and temptation."
The question was asked, can such things
be remedied, and the answer was, it is not
possible to remove the germ of evil from
the soil of human nature.
There should be an educational center,
so that when men speak of vice, it should
mean those who commit vice. It is possi
ble to remove the examines, incentives
amusements that have much to do with
vicious personality, possible that many
who have falUn in the slough of despond
may be uplifted.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1896.
FITZSIMMONS TO
FIGHT SHARKEY
The Blacksmith and the
Sailor Were Matched
Yesterday.
Tom' Says E? Will Give Him a
Harder Game Than Peter
Maher.
TEN BOUNDS, TEN THOUSAND.
The Contest Will Be Held in This
City Some Time in De
cember.
Just as scon as Bob Fitzsimmons learned
that Jim Corbett had trouble with his
wife he concluded right there and then
that he could not do any further business
with the champion, and his manager
wisely decided that a bird in the hand was
worth two in the bush and wired his ac
ceptance to the offer made to him by
Manager Groom of the National Club in
this wise :
New York, N. V., Oct 24, 1896.
J. J. Groom, National Club, San Francisco:
Conditions ail right; will accept your offer.
Deposi t forfeit of $3000, the remaining hull of
v hich to be puid us in case you fail to pull off
the match. Telegraph $500 for expenses at
once, as we will leave here immediately for
Frisco. Martin Julian,
Manager for Robert Fnzsimmona.
Tom Sharkey felt as frisky as a young
colt last evening. He said:
"I don't know how I'll get alone with
Fitzsimmons, but you can bet that I'll
keep him thinking while we're at it. I'll
zive him a differeut game to that which
Peter Maher put up. I can't say any more
just now."
Sharkey will, in all probability, train in
Oakland under the care ot Danny Need
ham, who was also matched last night by
the National Club to figtit George Green
in the latter part of November a ten-round
contest.
According to the agreement, a copy of
which was mailed to Fitzsimmons a few
weeks ago, tne pu^illstd will fight ten
rounds'for a $10,000 purse, the winner to
take all. The referee will be selected by
the club.
The general opinion of sporting men is
that Sharkey will meet in Fitzsimmons a
much harder raati to whip than Corbett,
and when the time for pool-selling will
arrive Fitzsimmons will surely sell a very
strong favorite.
A prominent sport said last night when
he heard of the match being consumma
ted, tnat Fitzsimmons would win the
tight the lirat good punch he landed on
Tom.
There are other ring-followers of more
conservative ways of thinking who believe
that Sharkey will stand a first-class chance
of whipping Fitzsimmons in a ten-round
bout. They contend that when Corbett
failed to hurt the sailor in four rounds
the New Zealander's chancers do not look
so very rosy.
RIGHTS OF SUPERVISORS.
San Joaquin Irrigation Company to Test
Their .Latitude in the courts.
An action which parallels to a certain
degree the famous horizontal cut of the
Railroad Commissioners was begun in the
United States Circuit Court yesterday in a
suit entitled "The San Joaquin and Kines
River Canal and Irrigation Company vs.
the County of Stanislaus and the Board of
Supervisors thereof."
The present litigation grew out of the
somewhat summary manner in which the
Supervisors 01 Stanislaus County in Feb
ruary last slashed the water rates of the
irrigation company. At the time men
tioned and on the protest of some twenty
five citizens the Supervisors inaugurated a
cut averaging 50 pr cent.
The corporation now comes forward
seeking an injunction, basing their claim
to a hearing in the Federal courts on the
ground that the act of the Legislature per
mitting Supervisors to enact laws detri
mental to the rights of private citizens,
companys or corporations is in direct
violation and repugnant to section 1,
fourteenth amendment of the constitution
of the United States.
CLUBMEN FIGHT.
Aleck Hamilton and Harry Gray Settle
Their Differences on Post
Street.
Pedestrians on Post street near Kearny
late last evening were surprised to wit
ness what seemed to be a fist fight between
two men, one of whom was arrayed in full
evening dress. Closer inspection showed
that one of the combatants was acting
mainly on the defensive.
It transpired that the latter, in evening
dress, was Harry Gray, and that he was
trying to good-naturedly keep off Aleck
Hamilton. The two men are prominent
members of the Bohemian Club, and
friends stated that Hamilton accused
Gray of insulting him by spitting in his
face.
"I was too much of a gentleman to re
sent the insult in the club," panted Ham
ilton, "but in the street here I em ready
for you," and he advanced on Gray.
Biff! biff! Clinch.
Frienus interfered and had great diffi
culty in hauling Hamilton away. He was
not, they said, in condition to fight. Mr.
Gray, who was acknowledged to have had
much the best of the bout, denied having
insulted Hamilton and said it was all the
result of a mistake.

SAD EXPERIENCE
WITH HUSBANDS
Mrs. Christine Luhrs-Cut
ting-Siebel Again
Divorced.
She Has Run the Gamut From
a Congressman to an
Embezzler.
IS STILL A YOUNG WOMAN.
Story of a Man Who Had a Cham
pagne Appetite and a Lager
Beer Income.
Although not yet twenty-five years of
age Mrs. Christine Luhrs-Cutting-Sieber
has been twice married â both times un
happilyâand twice divorced. Her first
husband was a Congressman of the United
States; the second, according to her own
story, a globe-trotting embezzler. The sec
ond chapter of her matrimonial expe
riences was closed yesterday in Judge
Slack's court.
Her first spouse was John T. Cutting,
representative from California, and her
more recent spouse, 6. A. Sieber, a subject
of the Emperor, with a tendency to travel
and to acquire funds.
The maiden name of the fascinating
Mrs. Sieber was Cbristino Luhrs, she being
a daughter of Mrs. A- E. Luhrs, widow of
a prominent Sen Francisco merchant of
early days. Mother and daughter for a
long time lived at the Occidental Hotel,
where they met Mr. Cutting. The first
marriage was ill-starred, and in 1894 the
wife secured a divorce, alleging she had
been cruelly treated.
In the fall of 1895 Mrs. Cutting left San
Francisco for a trip to Europe, but in
New York' she met the dating Mr.
Siebar, who, with tales of his adventures
by land and sea, won her heart.
Charmed by the prospect, the adventur
ous spirit of her California!! parents
stirred Mrs. Cutting and she yielded to
her lover's pleadings. On October 27, less
than a year ago, she became Mrs. Sieber.
In a v. ry short time she awoke to a
realization of the fact that existence with
her new spouse was not to be one of joy
unalloyed. Not three months had passed
before be began to treat hei cruelly, and
in less than six months she had parted
from him forever, returning to California.
In May last she applied for a divorce.
The complaint contained the specific
charges that on February 1 Mr. Sieber, at
200 Dearborn avenue, Chicago, where they
were then living, struck her with his
clenched fist and threw her violently
against the wall of their room. February
15, while they were living at the Allen
House in New York, it was alleged that
the husband pointed a loaded pistol at his
wife and threatened to kill her, at the
same time calling her vile names.
In his answer to his wife's suit Sieber
denied the charges of cruelty, and claimed
his wife was not a resident of California,
but only came here to obtain a divorce.
For a separate answer and cross-complaint
he alleged that she was possessed of a ter
rific temper, used intoxicants to excess,
smoked cigarettes, used vile language and

otherwise conducted herself in ways that
a lady should not. He said also that
Mrs. Luhrs accompanied her daughter
wherever she went and aided and encour
aged her in her unladylike actions.
A time when Sieber was sick with quinsy
was mentioned, it being alleged that his
wife substituted carbolic acid ior his medi
cine and almost killed him. When he
was recovering, he says, his wife told him
it would be no loss if he were dead, as she
had five men waitint? for her in San Fran
cisco. Sieber abo charged that when his
wife left him she confiscated $2000 worth
of his personal property.
While on the stand yesterday Mrs. Sieber
explained the cau-es whic â  led up to the
occurrences of February 1 and 15. She
said that on the former occasion her hus
band had obtained possession of $500, a
portion of which she wi-hed him to leave
with her for safekeeping. He refused, and
when she insisted he struck her over the
knuckles with a cane and threw her aside
as he left the room.
The New York episode, she said, was
caused by her refusal to give her husband
certain jewelry which he had pawned and
which she had redeemed. He wished to
again get possession of it, that he might
pledge it onoe more, and on being refused
drew out a pistol and threatened to kill
her.
Mrs. Sieber explained her husband's
failure to appear, after having filed an
answer, by stating that he was in jail in
New York, on a charge of embezzlement.
Judu'e Slack granted the wife a decree
on the ground of cruelty, and, if the ex
husband is to be believed, so made five
other souls happy.
THE LABOR UNIONS.
Pictures of lenement-Houia Cigar-
Makera to Be Presented
Soon.
The San Francisco Labor Council held a
short session last evening. A communi
cation was received from the Journeymen
Bakers' and Confectioners' International
Union of America, at Brooklyn, N. V.,
notifying the local council that the organ
ized bakers of the country have decided to
adopt a union crack r label. The writer
asks the San Francisco unions to be favor
ably disposed toward certain cracker-bak
ing companies that have adopted the un
ion's blue label.
The delegate from the Cigar-makers'
Union reported that his union had de
cided to ask the State Le islatnre to
change Labor day from the first Monday
in October to the first Monday in Septem
ber, so as to conform to Labor day all over
the country. He asked the co-operation
of the Council in this movement. He
also "reported that an eloquent speaker is
coming from the East in the cause of
unionism and the blue label, and to show
how many of the popular brands of East
ern-made cigars are made in cheap tene
ment-houses. He will be provided with
stereoDticon views to prove the truth of
his assertions.
Delegate Furuseth of the Coast Seamen's
jJnion stated there is no need for concern
in the reported reduction of wagps of sail
ors by the ship-owners. All the vessels
going out are shipping at the regular
wages.
Struck by a Crowbar.
William Kennedy, a welldigger, is lying at.
the point of death at the City and County
Hospital. Yesterday afternoon he was dig
ging a well out on the Mission road, when a
crowbar slipped from the surface and fell,
striking him on the top of the head. He was
removed to the hospital, where it was found
necessary to remove several pieces of his frac
tured skull, leaving the brain unprotected.
Kennedy wan in a semi-conscious condition

A VICTIM OF
ILLEGAL PRACTICE
Mrs. p-ertrude Hunt Suc
cumbs to a Criminal
Operation.
Mrs. Wegner Accused of Causing
the Young Woman's
Death.
THE POLICE ABE NOTIFIED
Detectives Search for the Suspected
Woman, bat Are Unable to
Locate Her.
Mrs. Gertrude Hunt, the young and
pretty wife of George E. Hunt, cuy agent
of the Union Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany, and mother of a baby girl 2 years
of age, died last evening in her rooms, 511
Turk street, from the result of a criminal
operation performed about two weeks ago.
Shortly before the unfortunate woman
died she accused Lira. Wegner, who re
sides at 419 Eddy street, with having com
mitted the crime.
Drs. Taylor and Stone, who were called
in to attend the dying woman, notified
the Coroner and be ordered the body re
moved to the Morgue and an autopsy
held. He then informed the police re
garding Mrs. Wegner and instructed them
to place her under arrest.
"I was calle-J to attend Mrs. Hunt last
Saturday evening," said Dr. Stone, "and
immediately saw that the case was the
result of criminal malpractice. As the
young woman appeared to be in a danger
bus condition I called Dr. Taylor in con
sultation. At rirst the patient refused to
mention the name of the party who per
formed the operation, bat as we refused to
attend to her case without that informa
tion she gave in and accused Mrs
Wegner."
Mrs. Hunt lingered between life and
death for several days and for the
last twenty-four hours of her life was
delirious, which prevented getting a
complete statement from her. She got
weaker and weaker and this evening at
8:30 o'clock she died. The immediate
cause of death was blood poisoning di
rectly caused by the criminal operation.
