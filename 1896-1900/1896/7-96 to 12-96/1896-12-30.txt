The Historic Spot Said to
Have Been Swallowed
by the Sea.
Some Interesting Photos Taken

A Beautiful Spot Made Famous by

If the reports of various sailors and sea
I captains may be believed the famous
ssland of Juan Fernandez is no more,
i Like thousands of dots in the ocean it has
disappeared from sight completely as if
swallowed by tellurion forces. Whether
true or false the story creates widespread
interest, for if the gods of. the sea have
arisen and condemned Robinson Crusoe's
island as if it were a wisp of paper, as sea"
captains say, interest in the event will be
as widespread as civilization itself. \
The rumor of the complete disappear

improbable from the fact that the island
has in recent years been violently shaken
by earthquakes.
Fernandez has always been described
as a picturesque spot four miles wide by
thirteen in length, but it contains all that
is necessary to sustain life. The ciimaie
Jtias always been described as pleasant and
healthful, the principal productions being
oats, turnips, apple?, strawberries, melons,
peaches and figs. Wild goats have always
been described as abundant, while large
quantities of excellent fish are taken from
tbe coast each year. In fact, the is i and
has for years been leased to a prominent
fish 6ompany by the Chilean Government.
Careful students of history and litera
ture believe that the prototype of Defoe 1 *
Robinson Crusoe was Peter Serrano, a
Spaniard, who was wrecked on an island
in the Caribbean iSea, not far from the
fouth of the Orinoco, in the sixteenth
ntury. Tradition ?ays he lived there in
solitude for many years and was finally
carried away on a trad in c vessel.
An account of the adventures of Ser-
rano was given in Sir Paul Rycan'.'s trans
lation of a series of commentaries on
w Peru, published in London and studied by
WDefoe before he wrote the famous story of
,A "Robinson Crusoe."
The island of Juan Fernandez was
thrown up from the earth in a series of
precipitous rocks irregularly piled to
gether. The highest of these was Alex
ander Selkirk's lockoutâ a peak about
8000 feet in height. The haibor un

valley opened feeding the bay with the
water collectec from the streams in the
ravines rlowingdown to the level. â 
This valley wai cultivated by the 100 or
so people living on the land. Pigs and
goats, descendants from ancestors left by
sailors, were in abundance until recently,
when the Chileans, faking their abode on
tbe ishi 'd, dcEtroye., them. Tbe island
wns long since abandoned as a Chilean
military post, and wis regarded more as a
curiosity by passing ships than as hav
ine any importance whatever.
But Juan Fernandez has an interesting
history apart from that with which Defoe
invests it It was discovered toward tbe
end ot the sixteenth century by a Spanish
sailor of tbe same name. Fernandez ob
tained it from the Spanish Government
and lived upon it for several years. He
stocked it with pigs and coats, but soon
grew tired of living alone and aban
doned it.
la 1616 it was visited by Spanish and
Portuguese sailors, who found it well
stocked with pigs and goats, and its waters
abounding in fish. Three soldiers and
three gunners were left upon it, but his
tory does not record what became of them.
For almost a century after that the island

was frequented by pirates. In 1688 the
buccaneer Sharp left five men on the
island. Twenty years later another buc
caneer left five more men, who lived there
I for five years, and were rescued by Cap-
I tain John Story of the English ship
I Welfare.
In the year 1704 the Cinque Pon
Juan Fernandez 10 ret-iver live men mou
tbe master, Captain Straddling, had ma
! rooned there four years before. Alex
i ander Selkirk was his mate, and mate and
j captain had a falling out. Selkirk insisted
I on being left on the island rather than
sail tbe seas with such a man as Strad
dling. The captain accommodated him,
and thus made Alexander the hero of
every boy that has lived since his time.
After fire years of exile on the island
Selkirk was rescued by Captain Wood
Rogers and bis ship Duke. It has been
doubted whether Defoe ever possessed the
marooned man's journal, but his story
was thrilling and the vivid imagination of
the author of "Robinson Crusoe" did the
rest.
Tbe mention of this historic bit of land
jutting up from the bed of the Pacific
recalls the name of Daniel Defoe, a house
hold word heard around the globe. But
no living person now bears the name, for
the last scion of that race is buried in
this City.
Several months ago a young sailor ar
rived here in an Englishship and was dis
charged from his ve.-s i. He was the
great-great-great-grandson of the novel
ist, and, like his famous relative,
was named Daniel Defoe. His story
was told exclusively in The Call,
a reporter of this journal interviewing
him immediately on his arrival. He wa
an intelligent, quiet young fellow, and in
the interview trankly stated that he pre
ferred Marryatt's stories to "Robinson
Crusoe." He subsequently died in the
City Receiving Hospital from consump
tion. 4

GOOD OFFICES
NOT ACCEPTED
Denials From Madrid as
to the Settlement of
the War.
Spain, However, Is Preparing to
Give Cubars a Large Meas
ure of Home Rule.
Many Reforms Are Promised, but It
Is a Question Whether Patriot 3
Will Accept Taem
MADRID, Spain, Dec. 29.â An emphatic
semi-official denial is given to the state
ments cabled here as coming from the
Washington Post to tbe effect that Secre
tary of State Olney and Senor Dupuy de
Lome, the Spanish Minister to the United
States, had practically terminated their
negotiations on tbe Cuban question and
detailing the extent of .the reforrc that
Spain would grait to Cuba under the
guarantee of the United States.
It s also semi-officially denied that the
Government has questioned Great Britain,
France and Italy regarding their attifude
m the event of a war with the United
Stntes.
WASHINGTON, 1). C. Dec. 29â While
it is not true that the Spanish Govern
ment will accept the mediation of the
United States in giving autonomy to
Cuba, it has been known for some weeks
that the Spanish Ministry propose giving
the Cubans a larger measure of home rule
than they have heretofore enjoyed.
President Cleveland has been repeatedly
assured that these reform would be
inaugurated when the province of J^inar
del Rio had been pacified. It was in this
province that General Maceo and his fol
lowers have been located for the last year,
and since Maceo's death the work of
pacification has been considerably expe
dited.
The time is not far distant when the
home-rule reforms will be instituted there
and also in the provinces of Matanzas and
Havana, where the insurgents have never
secured a foothold. It has been frequently
asserted that Spanish intended reforms
would have been put in operation
two year 3 ago but for the insurrection and
that the insurgents started the rebellion
in order to prevent the reforms.
These reforms embrace the election of a
Cuban Congress, instead of a mixed con
gress of fifty elected members and fifty
appointed by the Queen Regent, and also
a complete control by Cuba of her tariff.
The Spanish Ministry are understood to
be engaged in drafting the proposed re
forms, but thus far the only Knowledge re
garding them is of a general nature. It is
believed that they would be completed
rtithin the next fortnight, and it is not
unlikely that a copy will be cabled to Sec
retary Oiney, by permission of the Span
ish Government.
WILL PASS THE SENATE
Vice- Vr**idrnt Stevenson lalka About
the Cameron Resolution.
NEW YORK. N. V., Dec. 29 âA special
to the Herald from St. Louis says: "The
CaTieron resolution recognizing the re
public of Cuba will, in my opinion, be
sure to pass the Senate," declared Vice-
President Stevenson: "lam not so sure
about its fate in the House, but I believe
that it will go to the President. I would
like to say more, but I am not
President. I have no opinion to
give of Mr. Cleveland's probable
action, because I have not talked with
hip. You know, all the papers know as
much about the President's ideas as I do.
I think, he has sufficiently indicated them.
I cannot say until after March <* whether
I think recognition of the Cuban republic
would be the cause of war or not."
COLRY`S ARMY FOR CUBA.
Thinks Bfi Can EnÂ»ily Secure â  From
10,000 to 20,000 Men.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Dec. 29.â General L.
W. Colby of Beatrice, who has tatcen upon
himself the task of lorming an American
army to fight for Cuban independence,
will start for the E;ist iv a few days, stop
ping at Chicago, Cleveland and New
York. From the latter place he will sail
for Cuba in an individual capacity to
look over the ground. In the course of an
extended interview with the United Asso
ciated Presses to-day be said:
"The conditions in favor of Cuban inde
pendence are improving daily, and the
Senate of the United States has sounded
tbe keynote of the true American policy.
Our Government and citizons should give
substantial aid and recognition to every
people on the American continent strug
gling for liberty and self-government.
The Cubans are by right a part of us, and
no monarchy should be permitted lodeny
them the right of self-government right
here under the shadow of the stars and
stripes."
As to the progress that is being made
for the organization of an American vol
unteer army in aid of tbe Cubans, General
Colby said :
"The organization is progressing; com
panies have been formed and enlisted in
many of the States and Territories, and
there is no question about obtaining from
10,000 to 20,000 able-bodied volunteers.
And let me tell you that when once an
armed legion of from 10,000 to 20,000
American volunteers lands in Cuba with
the necessary subsistence for thirty days
a public sentiment will be created that
will place 50,000 re-enforcements in condi
tion to follow in a few weeks. Those de
siring to give aid to Cuban liberty and in
dependence should organize into com
panies in the different localities and wiite
to me at Beatrice, Nebr., for enlistment
papers and instructions. Let American
sentiment and patriotism be once crystal
lized into organization and action and
Cuban liberty will be an easily accom
plished fact."
General Colby is confident of receiving
substantial encouragement in the East.
DISCREDITED BY OFFICIALS
; lltged Exploit of the Three Friends Xot
Reported to the Spanish Legation.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Dec. 29.â The
officials of the Spanish legation say that
if there bad been the slightest shred of
truth in the sensational stories published
about the Three Friends firing upon
Spanish gunboats they would have been
promptly informed of the facts by acting
Captain-General Ahuniada in Havana,
and it would have been the imperative
duty of the Spanish legation to have de
manded the surrender of the boat and its
officer.-* to the Spanish Government, to be
dealt with according 10 the universally
recognized law of nations. Absolutely no
report of any such alleged ana absurdly
improbable occurrence has been received.
Moreover tbe Spanish legation is taking
no interest in the trial of the Three
Friends in the United States court at
Jacksonville.
"This is the fifth time she has been
libeled," said a prominent member of the
legation, "and 'I suppose sbe will be re
leased as usual."

i ; NEW i YORK, N. V... Dec 29.â An offi
cer of the ; steamer Vigilancia, which ar
rived from Havana yesterday, said that
while tbe vessel lay at Havana he learned
from several Cubans in that city that the
belief prevailed there among the adherents
to tbe Cuban cause that Maceo was not
murdered. He is now planning a coup
d'etat in Mantanzas. They base their be
lief on a story told by a passenger on a
train which skirts the boundary of the
prevnee of Matanzas, who declared that
be i?w" G-pnerai Maceo passing Lear the
train with his troops as the train moved
slotviy along.
The officers of the steamship bad seen
nothing of the filibuster Three Friends
and were surprised and greatly interested
when informed of the recent thrilling
episode in which the little craft is alleged
to have taken part while trying to land
arms and men on the Cuban coast re
cently.
CHARGE OF CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY
Fortier's Wholesale Crusade Against the
American Tobacco Company in
Canada.
MONTREAL, Queebec, Dec 29. â The
charges ot criminal conspiracy to impede
trade made by J. M. Fortier against the
American Tobacco Company is assuming
an aspect far more important than it was
at first expected. Warrants have been is
sued in Quebec for the arrest of such
members of the company as may be in
Montreal, and they wiil have to appear for
trial in Quebec on January 7.
In the meantime the profit Fortier
would have earned had not the American
company, as alleged, impeded the trade,
is now being figured upon by bis attor
neys, who will at once institute a civil
action for damages. The sum will prob
ably total up an average of several hun
dred thousand dollars and the suit ior its
recovery will be bitterly fought.
Preparations are now being made by
which warrants will be issued in nearly
every province of Canada, wherever the
American company has succeeded in get
ting a dealer to sign an agreement. These
warrants will be served on Montreal mem
bers, and they will have to appear for
trial in as far distant a province as Prince
Edward Island.
TONS OF WATER POURED DOWN.
Towns In the Island of St. Michael, in
the Azores, Destroyed by a
Waterspout.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 29.â The Portu
guese consulate in this city has re
ceived a petition from the Island of St.
Michael, in the Azores, signed by a rep
resentative of the Portuguese Gov
ernment and nineteen other of the princi
pal citizens, asking aid for the sufferers
by the bursting of a giant waterspout on
November 2 over the city of Povoacao.
Tbe petition states that t ere is much
suffering for food, clothing and shelter,
and gives some particulars of the calamity,
than which it states none has been more
devastating in tbe history of the island.
Tons of water poured down upon the
city, which was of about 25,000 inhabi
tants, mounting above the roofs of the
houses, ripping up the streets and carry
ing destruction everywhere in its path.
The torrent rushed down the slopes to the
sea, tearing a wide channel through nine
miles of country and carrying with it the
homes of thousands of people.
The flood also destroyed the town of
Riberia Quente, of 3000 population, and
several outlying parishes. AH along the
coast tbe fishermen lost their boats, and
the shore was* littered with corpses cf
tho.-e who perished in tbe floods.

There Will Probably Be a Larger

DUBLIN, Ireland, Dec. 29.â The danger
from the landslide near Rathmore, County
Kerry, is b^k no means ever, but rather
on the increase. That part of the dis
turbed earth comprising the bog is still
sliding toward the Lakes of Kiilarney,
its movement being accompanied by a
sullen noise that is heard for miies in all
directions.
Peasants living some distance from the
scene are fleeing from their houses and
taking refuge in localities that give prom
ise of safety, leaving all belongings behind
them.
Debris of houses and trunks of trees
destroyed by the avalanches of earth, to
gether with the carcasses of co\?s, sheep,
pigs aud other animals caught in the
landslide and plunged into the river, are
being swept into the lakes.
The nver Flesk is choked with earth,
rocks, trees, etc., and the extra water
spread over a lar^e area, causing a greater
loss of life than had been reported yester
day. The Donnelly family of nine per
sons, engulfed in the torrent of earth, was
lost. There are fears that other persons
have been caught in the tide and have
perished.
LONDON, Eng., Dec. 29.â A dispatch to
the Daily Graphic from Dublin says that
the bog slile threatens the town of Kiilar
ney. Another report says that the slide
has ceased.
WAS MISS COLLINS MURDERED?
Some New and Interesting Revelatons
Connected With the Death of
Herself and Putnam.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 29.â 0n the morn
ing of December 12 Miss May L. Collins
and Samuel P. Putnam, free-tb inkers,
were found dead in each other's arms in a
room of the apartment-house at 47 St.
Botolph street, at which place the *omm>
had been rooming about a week.. Ati ex
amination of the death-chamber disclosed
an open gasburner. Through this- the
gas had escaped, and, it is supposed, as
phyxiated the occupants. On the table
was a bottle of whisky and several ounces
of benedictine. It was said by some that
these spirits were pertinent factors in the
tragedy.
Despite the verdict of the medical ex
aroiner that the victims were killed "oy ac
cidental gas-poisoning the police looked
upon the case as a double suicide. It now
appears that two private detectives are in
town looking for evidence with which
they hope to destroy every theory hereto
fore advanced in connection with this re
markable tragedy. The brother of Mia3
Collins and her friend*: in Midway, Kv.,
are responsible for the presence of these
detectives in town.
In the first place they hope to prove
that Miss Collins did not commit suicide.
They expect to show by evidence that she
was murdered by the man whom she re
garded as her best friend. Already,
they say, they have a mass of circum
stantial and direct evidence which will
demonstrate pretty clearly that Putnam
drugged his partner and then turned on
the gas and laid down to die with tne girl
he loved but could not marry.
The detectives from Lexington will
show in goo I time, they say, that it was a
case of deliberate murder and suicide â
that Putnam, old man that he was, loved
the girl, and, knowing that she could
never be his wife, determined that she
should accompany him to eternity.
The medical examiner, despite the sus
picious circumstances about the affair, de
cided not to hold an autopsy. Had an
autopsy been held Miss Collins would not
have been proclaimed a suicide, the men
from Kentucky aver.
The detectives do not place any credence
in Mr. Collins* assertion that his sister
was murdered for the diamonds she in
trusted to Putnam just before she left
Chicago. Miss Collins was considered ec
centric, and upon free thought she was a
monomaniac.
BRADLEY WILL RESIGN
Political dtriff in Kentucky Telling on

LOUISVILLE, Ky,, Dec. 29.â A dis

tends to resign the office of Governor at an
early date. He told a friend Monday
afternoon be was going to resign, no mat
ter what tbe ouicome of the political
issues at stake. He said tbe place was

The recent exciting experience that
Bradley had in regard to the selection of a
United States Senator told on him greatly
and he has never been the same man since.
He has been a very energetic Republican
Governor and the Democratic politicians
of the State have made it quite warm for
him.

FAILURE OF THE
VAN NORTWICKS
Fortune of Five Millions
Left by the Father in
Jeopardy.
Creditors of the Vast Enterprises
Conducted by the Brothers
to Be All Paid.
Their Collapse Dae to an Impossi
bility to Immediately Borrow
More Money.
BATAVIA, 111., Dec 29.â Although the
Van Nortwick brothers owned a large part
of the manufacturing industries and real
estate of this town the assignment of their
vast and varied interests yesterday caused
no other business trouble or a run on the
banks to-day. There was more surprise
and regret than excitement, and a general
belief that the assets were clear ana profit
able and that every creditor would get
dollar for dollar, although it might take
i-ome time to realize in the depressed con
dition of business.
William M. Van Nortwick was in Chi
cago to-day consulting with his attorneys
and tbe Equitable Trust Company officials,
receivers of the properties.
The First National Bank took in more
money than it paid out. Cashier Grimes-
Jay, in charge of tbe Van Nortwick bank,
which did not open its doors this morn
ing, said he received information that the
bank would be closed yesterday afternoon.
Deposits were received until the lan min
ute. The creditors of the bank are ex
pected to get their money first, as the ma
jority are in need of their savings. The
assignment includes the individ
ual property of the brothers, even
to their homestead and tbe stock
of the firm in the Fillmore
County Bank, Western Paper Bag Com
pany, Batavia; Apple ton Manufacturing
Company of Appleton, TV is. ; Memphis
Woodenware Company of Memphis, Term. ;
Aurora Cotton-mills of Anrora, 111. ; Kau
kauna Paper Company of Kaukauna.Wis. ;
Combined Locks Paper Company, Wis
consin Sulphate Fiber Company and
Union Puip Corrpany of the Fox River
Valley, in and near Appleton, Wis. There
are pine-land holdings in Missouri and
other persona) interests, which cover all
that remains of tbe estate of 15,000,000 in
herited in IS9O from their deceased father,
John Van Nortwick.
The cash value of assets is estimated by
the firm's attorney in Chicago, A. W.
Green, at $1,000,000 and the liabilities at
1400,000 to 1500,000. This estimate of assets
is believed here to be very low. The
brothers are blamed for not financiering
their property, investing to the limit of
tbeir resources in various enterprises with
out taking the precaution of keeping a
reserve ol quick assets, such as stocks and
bonds, upon which they might have real
ized in an emergency such as this was.
Along time loan was being negotiated
pn the $700,000 plant at Appleton, Wie.,
which would have enabled the brothers to
weather the storm, when the Illinois Bank
failed. Having a bank of their own and
having borrowed to the legal limitâs3oo,
000âfrom the Atlas Bank, in which they
were heavy stockholders, it was a difficult
task for the Van Nortwicks to get a large
amount of money from a bank where they
were strangers, even on their money mat
ing properties. Their collapse was the re
sult of failure to borrow mort money.
APPLETON, Wis., Dec. 29.â The failure
of Van Nortwick Bros. Bank at Batavia,
111., involved the Appleton Manufacturing
Company's agricultural works at Geneva,
111., and the Western Paper Bag Com
pany's paper and bag manufacturing com
pany at Batavia, but has not yet affected
the Six River Valley properties of that
place. It is believed the Six River prop
erty will puli through all ri^ht.
Tbe Citizens' National Bank of this
city, of which John S. Van Nortwick was
president, will not be involved in the fail
ure. John S. has resigned as president
and director and his place has just been
filltd by LamarOlmstead as president and
John McNauehton as director. No run
has begun on the bank, although the
news of the embarrassment of the Van
Nortwicks has created a flurry in business
circles. John S. Van Nortwick, who is in
the city, to-day refused absolutely to be
lnterviewcJ r?eard'ng his embarrassment.

ports of the meeting sent out from Den
ver. The meetiner empowered a sub-com
mittee, of wh.ch Rev. S. H. Malone. editor
of the Colorado Catholic, was chairman,
to bring in resolutions condeming such
reports &s being unfair and misleading.
The resolutions were as follows:
Whereas, It has been represented in some
Eastern newspapers that at the recent mnss
meeting of the unemployed held in this city
addresses were delivered by Rev. Myron Reed
and Thfcmas Uzzel which advocated physical
violence as a remedy Jor tue unemployed and
were incendiary and anarchistic in character,
be It
Resolved, That this committee, representing
the unemployed of Denver, do hereby â¢tigraa.
tize these charges as gross exaggeration and
deliberate misrepresentation of what was said
by the Revs. Reed and Uzzell. While we leel
that the circumstances which caused the
meeting to assemble warranted the use of
strong and vigorous language we deem it our
duty to the Rev*. Reea ami Uzzell to declare
emphatically that the construction placed
upon their language was unjustifiable and
unfair to them and the thousands assembled
to hear them.
BAN UPON A NEWSPAPER.
There is No End to the Complications
Growing Out of the Vexed Mani
toba School Question.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Dec. 29.â The
mandament issued by the Roman Catho
lic bishops of Quebec forbidding faithful
Catholics to "subscribe for, read, circulate
or otherwise encourage the newspaper
L'Electeur, published in Quebec City,
under pain of being deprived of the ben
efits of tbe church," has created intense
excitement throughout the Province and
is denounced in strong terms by the lib
eral French and English papers.
Mr. Pacaud, publisher of the condemned
paper, will, it is understood, take an ac
tion for $5000 damages acainst each of the
Bishops who signed the mandament, and
a number of prominent men here have
expressed their willingness to subscribe
toward carrying the case to the Privy
Council if necessary. La Patrie, a Liberal
French paper published in this city, says:
"It is Mr. Pacaud who was struck, but
Mr. Laurier, who was aimed at. It is
tbe L'Eiecteur which is assassinated, but
in the hope that the point of the dagger,
after having killed Pacaud, will strike the
first minister of Canada in a vital spot.
The execution of L'Electeur at Quebec is
and can be only the beginning of a strug
gle to the death with the Government at
Ottawa."
Mr. Pacaud says he will cease the publi
cation of his paper and appual from the
condemnation of the bishops to the Roman
Court. The offense of L'Electeur con
sisted in publishing a pamphlet written
by Mr. David, upholding the doctrine of
the supremacy of the state in state affairs
and denying tbe right of the church to
dictate to electors how they shall vote
upon such a question as the restoration of
eeparate schools in Manitoba.

CHINESE REVOLUTIONARY JUNTA.
Chicago the Headquarters of Celestials
Who Plot to Overthrow the Manchu
Dynasty.
CHICAGO, 111., Dec 29.â A morning
paper prints the following: According to
versatile Wong Chin Foo Chicago is to
become headquarters for tbe Chinese
revolutionary junta. This body plans the
overthrow of the Manchu dynasty now
regnant in the Flowery Kingdom by an
armed invasion from a convenient South
Sea Island.
Rooms for the Junta have been engaged
At 329 South Clark street, and the Mongo
lians who dwell in that vicinity await the
coming of Sung Vat Sen to set the ma
chinery in operation, which is to open
China to Western civilization.
Bung Vat Sen is the Ceiestiai revolu
tionist who recently wa-> kidnaped iv tbe
streets of London and whose release was
effectea by Lord Salisbury. He now is
collecting money and organizing his fol
lowers in England. He will sail for
America within two or three weeks, where
he will confer with Wong Chin Foo of
Chicago and other leaders of the Chinese
reform party in this country.
Wong Chin Foo at present is hard at
worK on magazine articles on Confucian
ism and in the preparation of Confucian
missionary lectures to be delivered in
Illinois and adjoining States. But he is
not neglecting bis duties as attorney for
the revolutionists.
The revolutionary societies in this coun
try and England number, it is said, thou
sands of Chinamen who have amassed
wealth, which is to be used when the time
ripens for the overthrow of the hated
Manchu dynasty.

STEADY RUN ON
MINNESOTA BANKS
It Causes Two More of the
Institutions to Close
Their Doors.
Failure of the Co'umbia National
Followed by- a Suspension
of the Washington.
There Is Also a Flurry at Other
Banks in the City of Min
neapolis
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Dec. 29.â The
Columbia National Bank, whose president
is Charles Kittleson, ex-State Treasurer,
and whose cashier is Joseph Bobleter, al-o
an ex-State Treasurer, failed to open its
doors this morning, and George M. Coffin,
deputy Comptroller of the Currency, who
happened to be in the city, took charge.
Cashier Bobleter said that the liabilities,
not including the capital stock, etc., and
including principally deposits, amount in
round numbers to $247,000, whi!<Â» the
assets, mostly notes, amounted to $450,0;. 0.
He said he had no doubt the depositors
would in time be paid in full. The State
is a creditor to the amount of $16,000 and
the county about $5000. The city had
$1200 on deposit. At the present time,
according to Cashier Bobleter, there 'is
$33,000 cash in the vault, and $100,000 will
be collected within the next thirty days.
The suspension was ordered for the pur
pose of protecting the majority of the
creditors. The bank's capital is $200,000.
The suspension of the Scandia yester
day and the Columbia this morning cre
ated consternation among the patrons of
the Washington Bank and such a run en
sued that the bank was compelled to close
its doors shortly after noon. Depositors
drew tbeir checks directly at the bank
and through the clearing- bouse at such a
rats that it was apparent that the interests
of all the depositors demanded a suspen
sion of business.
The bank knew that its strength wonld
be sorely taxed to-day and had made ar
rangements to get $50,000 in cash, whicn
would have tided it over safely, but the
money was not forthcoming this morning,
and after a vain attempt to stand tbe
demands Cashier Brecke telephoned Bank
Examiner Kenyon that the officials had
decided to close the bank and asked aim
to take charge.
Cashier Brecke stated tbis afternoon
that aside from the matter of cash on
hand the bank was in excellent shape.
Exactly what will be aone has not yet
been determined. It is quite likely that
tbe suspension will be only temporary, as
the assets of the bank are in such shape,
according to Mr. Brecke, that its deposit
ors can be paid in full in a comparatively
short time and 50 cents on the dollar
within two months.
In round numbers tbe liabilities are
$500,000, and the assets $600,000. Of the
latter only $14,500 is real estate. The bank
bad some city deposits, $3000 of State
mouey and $4000 of the county's. The
bank's officials are: President, A. C.
Hangen, who is at present City Treasurer;
vice-president, K. S. E. Johnson; cashier,
O. E. Brecke.
The bank's loans and discounts are
$507,145. Its deposits are $458,000 and its
capital stock $100,000.
The announcement of the failure of the
Columbia and Washington banks caused a
considerable flurry at nearly all of the
other banks of the city. The biggest run
was on ihe Farmers' and Mechanics'
Bank, the largest savings institution in
the Northwest, with deposits of over
$6,000,000. This bantc is said to be entirely
safe. It stood a constant run of eight
days during the panic of 1893.

opposed him as too objectionable to the
sound money men, and Healy was se
lected as a compromise. C. S. Ranck of
lowa City, one of the sound money sym
pathizers on the committee, led tbe fight
against Walsh, and he was taken out of
tbe race. It was announced that Walsh
will soon go to Washington to take charge
of work at the national headquarters.

MARRIED UNDER
THE MISTLETOE
Miss Bonaparte Becomes
the Bride of Count
Huitfeldt.
One of the Most Interesting ol
Internationa! Weddings at
Washington.
National Colors of the United States
and Denmark a Part of the
Decorations.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 29.â The
wedding of Count Adam de Moltke Huit
feldt oi DenmarKund Miss Louise Eugenic
Bonapar)e, daughter of the widow of the
late Colonel J. Bonaparte, took place this
morning in St. Paul's Catholic Church. It
was one of the most interesting interna
tional marriages which has taken place in
Washington for many years.
Owing to the recent death of the father
of the groom while Danish Embnssador
at Paris, the placs for an imposing cere
mony had to be abandoned and compara
tively few invitations to the marriage and
wedding were issued. The church was
handsomely decorated with flowers and
palms suggestive of the Christmas season,
holly and mistletoe 'being used in abun
dance.
The national colors of the United States
and Denmark were blended in the wall
panels. The ushers were Messrs. Walter
Van Rennselaer Berry, Frank Andrews,
Charles McCawley and Robert Wallace,
all of this city. The groom was attended
at the altar by his brother, Count Leon
de Moltke Huitieldt. The bride was
escorted to the altar and given in mar
riage by her uncle, Charles Bonaparte of
Baltimore. His Eminence Cardinal Gib
bons, Archbishop of Baltimore, an old
friend of the Bonaparte family, performed
the ceremony.
The bride was attired in an exquisite
gown of white satin, tbe trimmings of
which was priceless old family lace. Her
veil was clasped to the hair ny a diamond
crescent, the gift of ex-Empress Eugenic,
the bride's godmother.
At the residence of Mrs. Bonaparte the
gifts showered upon the bride were ex
hibited to the breakfast party. They com
prised one of the most elaborate and
superb collections ever bestowed upon a
bride. Count de Moltke Huitfeldt and
bride will proceed to St. Petersburg,
which place will be their home for a time
at least.
Miss Bonaparte, the bride of to-day, is
the great-great-granddaughter of the
famous beauty, "Betsy" Patterson of Bal
timore, whose marriage to Jerome Bona
parte, brother of Napoleon Bonaparte,
was celebrated at Baltimore. The alliance
was not recognized by Napoleon Bona
parte, and Jerome, yielding to his solici
tations and demands, abandoned his
American wife, who indignantly rejected
Napoleon's offer of a large pension "pro
vided she does not take the name of my
family." Her son, Jerome Napoleon
Bonaparte, was born in the suburbs of
London, Â£ng., where she had been forced
tD take refuge by tbe relentless persecu
tion of her brother-in-law. The events
that followed are historic, the refusal of
the Pope to dissolve the marriage, the de
cree of the Council of State of France
under Napoleon's dictation declaring it
null, Jerome's creation by Napoleon as
King of Westphalia and his subsequent
marriage to a Princess of WurtemDerg.
The name "Jerome," which Mme. Patter
son Bonaparte conferred upon her only
son, has been handed aown in tbe family
ever since.

Only 600 invitations were issued to the
ceremony, but tbe crush about the church
was so great the ushers were powerless to
keep out the crowd.
The Right Rev. Thomas Hickey, Vicar-
General of the diocese, performed tbe cere
mony, assisted by Rev. Father O'Connor.
The church was brilliant with incan
descent lamps. Strands of evergreens
were draped from the arches oJ the ceiling

MILES AND JEFFERSON BARRACKS
The Commanding General of the Arm}
Answers Criticisms That Were
Made Fre maturely.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 29.âGen
eral Miles answers attacks made ipon
him in Western n wspapers in regard to
his action in respect to the Jefferson bar
racks in St. Louis by stating that when, in
October last, he returned from his tour of
inspection of military posts in the West
he found at Jefferson barracks more com
plaint concerning the location of that fort
than of any of tbe other stations. There
was some coinplaint that there was and
has been many cases of typhoid fever and
other f#ver, and that the ground was
honeycombed with deep lagoons, some
below the level of the river, an<l it was
believed that tne drainage from St. Louis
seeped tiirough the quicksand at high
water and left poisonous gerrrs at the
base of the lagoons. The commanding
officer stated to the commanding general
of the army that it could never be made a
suiable cavalry post. He said that it had
cost $6000 to fill up one of these lagoons
and that there were at least fifty on the
reservation.
General Miles directed a board of ex
perts to make a thorough investigation of
the sanitary condition of that ground, to
guard the welfare of the troops and the
puolic. â¢ General Milos also states that he
has not the slightest prejudice against St.
Louis or any other section of the United
States, and he never knew it until be saw
it in the papers that the representatives of
the Loyal Legion voted for his old friend,
General Gibbon, for commander instead of
himself. The election of General Gibbon
was entirely satisfactory to him. The
question of the condition of Arcadia Val
iey was a matter already decided, as far as
General Miles was concerned, a3 he had
on November 10 recommended the pur
chase of tnat ground for a reserve.
General Miles lias never recommended
the abandonment of Jefferson barracks.
Hi' future action will be governed by the
official report concerning that station.
MOVEMENTS OF WARSHIPS.
Setfridge Leaves for Smyrna and
Beardnlee for Valparaiso.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 29.-A
cable from Admiral Selfridge to the Navy
Department announces that he was leav
ing Smyrna in the flagship San Franusco
for Nice and Genoa, where it is exrected
that the ship will be docked and cteaned
according to the regulations which re
quire docking once in six montns, the
San Francisco having been las> docked
at Genoa in May.
The admiral's departure at ibis time is
taken by the authorities here to indicate
an improved condition of affairs in
Turkey, as the smaller cruiser Cincinnati
and the gunboat Bancroft ere left alone
at Smyrna, the Minneapolis having gone
down to Alexandria last *eek. The en
tire fleet had been at Smyrna since
October 14, and their lon^ stay there was
understood to have b>*n at Minister
Terrell's request, as he beared an uprising
which might render *beir presence de
sirable. Now that theforce at Constanti
nople is reduced to such insignificant pro
portions, it is thought the Minister fore
sees no trouble in thf immediate future.
Admiral Beardsleein the flagship Phila
delphia, after spending a week at Callao,
.Peru, has sailed for Valparaiso, Chile, the
first visit of an American admiral to that
port since tbe attack on the Baltimore's
men, which came to near leading to war.
The bad feeling w.iicb grew out of that
incident has been vholly dissipated and
it is expected that Admiral Beardslee
will receive distinguished courtesies from
the Chilean authorries.

Cotton Men Cannot Compete With tin
Cheapar Labor of Germany
and Egypt.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 29. -The
second day of the tariff hearing before the
Committee of Way 3 and Means of the
House of Representatives was taken up
wi;h the discussion of schedule 1, cot
ton manufactures. Tne first section of the
schedule relates to the duty on cotton
tnread and carded yarns or warp yarns.
The gf ntleraen who were present to en
lighten the committee in regard to those
manufactures were Andrew B. Sanford, R.
C. Kerr and W. J). Howl, representing the
Cotton-Epinners' Association of Fall River,
Mass., and J. A. Campbell, J. C. Young
and H. J. McNally of Manayunk, Pa. Mr.
Sanford stated the views of the Cotton
spinners' Associatir>n, and was subjected
to close questioning on the part of the two
Democratic members.
Mr. Sanford said that the provisions
placed in the tariff bill bad practically
made it an ad valorem measure. It was
simply impossible, he said, for the spin
ners of this country to put out any tine
yarns, and the mills bad been compelled
to stop the making of tine yarns.
Robert Pilling of Philadelphia, a maker
of stockings and underwear, said the pres
ent law was not satisfactory and especially
on foreign fashion goods. Referring to
labor, he said that here it was paid four
times as much as in Germany, the great
competitor in the stocking trade.
H. B. Chase of Fall River, Mass., spoke
for the makers of cotton cioih. They
wc-re not sufficiently protected on the fine
end of the business, he said, and would
ask for a few amendments to the present
law in this direction. They wanted a new
classification for cloths exceeding 300
threads to the square inch; otherwise they
wire satisfied with the present duties.
He also desired to have goods known as
'â¢figured weaves" specially provided for.
He complained, of ad valorem duties and
the undervaluing practiced upon them.
R. W. Cooper of Olneyville. R. L, a
manufacturer of the line grades of stock
ings, asKed for a tariff of 40 cents per
dozen and 30 per cent ad valorem on all
goods costing $1 50 per dozen and under.
His company nad been doing bnnness for
twelve years and had never passed a divi
dend. It was beginning to get on its feet
under the McKinley law, but under the
present tariff had just managed to exist
W. R. Craig of Mississippi, on behalf of
produce's of "extra staple," cotton of the
Mississippi Valley, asked tor protection
against Egyptian cotton. This cotton, he
said, came into direct competition witti
the domestic product and to a, large ex
tent had driven the domestic growers out.
The commission adjourned until to
morrow, when the sugar schedule will be
taken up.

Djclares a Southern Pacific Map Of

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 29â It has long
been proverbial in this part of the State
that the ingenious irngationist "can run
water uphill." The Southern Pacific peo
ple are not lacking in similar knowledge.
They have made a good many demonstra
tions before the Harbor Commission
which have been original and unique, but
it remained for this day's hearing to build
up a principle which should eclipse all
their former efforts.
The first witness for the Santa Monica
side in rebuttal was a Captain Saimond.
Captain Saimond is no ordinary mariner.
He is a scientist and genius combined.
Notwithstanding the fact that he is ultra-
British and has been on the waters along
this coast but precious little, he knew all
about local waves, currents, fogs and any
thing else, important or unimportant. His
learned disquisition tor}k the Commission
ers almost off their seats. Noi content
with displaying lack of marine knowledge
he came inland and explained all about
the currents of cold and hot air traveling
to and from the snowclad Sierras and the
THE RIVAL HARBORS.
The above map, taken from the United States Coast Survey charts, shows the direction of
the coast line at San Pedro and Santa Monica, the depth of the indentations and the compara
tive exposure of each harbor to the force of the winds and waves.
On this section of th& coast, as is commonly known and well emphasized in the testimony
before the Harbor Commission, the greater proportion of the winds, and by far the most
nevere, come trom the southwest and west. To these winds and the heavy ssas Called up by
them tbe so-called harbor at Santa Moni.u is fully exposed, and in the opinion of those who
have had long experience on these coasts and the fullest opportunity lor observation, ship
captains and others, no amount of expenditure on artificial protection can so alter the natural
as to make Santa Monica a permanently safe harbor. At San Pedro, on the other hand, the
high mountain to the west of the place, with Point Firmin running far out into the sea to the
south, give ample protection from the western winds and waves, and Santa Catalina Island
directly to the southwest, forms a natural bulwark over twenty miles long in that direction.
Against the far side of this island the waves, which have had an uninterrupted sweep for
thousands of miles across tho deep waters of the Pacific, expend their force, and San Fedro
gets none of it; while Santa Monica, out of the range of this protection and having no otber,
is exposed to their full fury.
sea, and from Siskiyou to San Diego.
The members of the boara smiled at vari
ous times at the entirely irrelevant disser
tation, but Captain Saimond did not un
derstand the smiles and so went on.
Now, this genius, through the careful
' manipulation of Engineer Corthell, estab
! lished the new and startling principle that
debris, coal and human bodies will stem
ocean current?, i. c., will, when precipi
tated into these strange waters, float in
the opposite direction to that of the cur
rents. Tiiis is not just what Captain Sai
mond said in so many words, but it was
the inevitable conclusion to be arrived at
from what he did say. He stated it as a
positive and incontrovertible fact that the
currents south of Point Conception were
all toward the west.
This is a contention which the Hunting
ton people have been endeavoring to veri
fy from the outset The allegation has
received so many jabs about the eyes by
both land lubbers and a score of old sea
men that it has been much disfigured.
Captain Saimond cleared the whole thing
up to-day in a manner 30 scientific that
the opposite doctrine ought to be aban
doned. The citizens of Long Beach must
now construct a new theory to account
for their being supplied with coal from
colliers discharging at San Pedro. Here
tofore these simple folk have thought that
their marine coal supply came to their
humble dwellings with the currents, not
against them. Moreover the bodies of
several sailors, fishermen and bathers who
lost their lives in the treacherous under*
tow at Lng Beach have invariably been
found cub. of the town. Usually these
bodies have lomfl ashore near the mouth
of Alamitas Creek, one mile east of the
Long Beach wharf, where most of the
drownings have occurred. In the case of
the unfortunate sailor, Alexander Flood,
who was drowned there last Saturday and
whose body was recovered yesterday, the
body was carried to Devil's Ge,te, nearly
three miles east from where it entered the
water.
Captain Saimond told the board that
there could be no mistake about his
theory; he knew what he was talking
about, and that "science makes no mis
takes." Having established the fact that
debris and detached material float against
the currents along this strange coast it
follows that a deep-sea harbor at San
Pedro, where it will undoubtedly be
located, is liable to fill up and, as Corthell
put it, "require constant dredging," owing
to the inflow of large quantities of these
things from Wilmington Slough, which is
east of the proposed haibor site.
At the close of Salmond's scientific evi
dence in rebuttal Engineer Moore of the
San Pedro contingent asked the English
gentleman to step up to the big Hunting
ton map and read aloud some words which
were printed by the aide of an arrow in
tended to indicate the direction of the
currents. He did so, and discovered that
tbe direction was almost opposite to that
which he had been trying to establish on
scientific grounds. The w tness looked
around in a bewildered way when Moore
inquired:
"What do you think of that?"
Saimond quickly responded, to the
great amusement of the spectators:
"The map is wrong."
Here was a Huntington witness giving
a black eye to a big Huntington map.
This is a fair sample of the case the Hunt
ingtonians are putting up in this fight.
The map has been condemned time and
again by witnesses for San Pedro be
cause ot its fraudulent partiality in favor
of everything Huntingtonian, but this is
the first instance where a Southern Pa
cific witness has jabbed the old thing out
of countenance.
Engineer Moore of the Terminal Com
pany resumed his remarks this morning
in favor of San Pedro. He said that since
the last meeting he had sketched several
rough plans for a breakwater for San
Pedro harbor. He placed one breakwater
between the seven and nine fathom con
tour, keeping close tÂ» the latter. This
proposed breakwater is connected with
the reef at Point Firmin. The east dyke
might also be extended to the bell buoy,
which is in seventeen feet of water. The
available area for a harbor between the six
and seven fathom contour would be thir
teen acres; on the nine fathom contour
there would be an area of 175 acres, wit., a
depth of water of 42 feet. The sketches
offered to the commission by Mr. Moore
for an outer harbor admit of an extension
of limits if necessary.
The angle of the proposed breakwater is
not normal with the swells. He believed
this an advantage. In fortifying this
position Mr. Moore quoted from Engineer
Stevenson, who is eminent in his profes
sion. An angle with the prevailing swells
is an advantage, continued Mr. Moore,
and all the authorities confirm the propo
sition. In a southeast sea, he contended,
mariners would no doubt avoid both pro
posed harbors. This last remark was
made in answer to a question by Engineer
Corthell. If experience should suggest it,
the opening of the harbor might be made
narrower, thus affording greater protec
tion from tbi* effects of southeast winds.
Engineer Corthellâ lf the harbor is made
according to your plans what would be
come of the detritus?
Engineer Moore â I should say it would
be carried out to sea. The water issuing
from the Wilmington lagoon would have
velocity sufficient to carry off all the ma
terial that might Accumulate.
Engineer Corthell was not satisfied with
the conclusion reached by Mr. Moore.
He thought the sediment would drift into
the pocket created by the proposed break
water. Mr. Moore was unable to give an
estimate of the area of the watershed or
the amount of water that naturally finds
an outlet at the San Pedro harbor site,
but he was satisfied the sediment would
never interfere with the efficiency of the
proposed harbor.
Atter Engineer William Hawgood had
tiled a prorile of the harbor at Plymouth,
England, Vice-President Thomas M. Gib
bon of the Terminal Railway began his
summing up on behalf of Sar. Pedro. His
corporation had so far expended over
$3,000,000 in the development of the har
bor facilities at that point. He confined
bis remarks to the transportation features
of the pending controversy.
Mr. Gibbon traced the growth of Los
Angeles from the early '80's and reviewed
tae harbor contest. The selection of Santa
Monica would meuu, in the speaker's
opinion, a commercial dependence of Los
Angeles upon the Southern Pacific Rail
road. He quoted Senator George C. Per
kins in the upper house of Congress, whose
claim has alway? been that the Southern
Pacific built its wharf at Santa Monica a*
a business investment, and not becnuse
C. P. Huntington at that time expected
tne Government to assist in the construc
tion of the harbor now proposed. Mr.
Gibbon called attention to the alleged
fact that if the proposed harbor was loca
ted in Santa Monica the board of trustees
of that town would absolutely control its
entrance and exit.
Mr. Gibbon, summing up, was brilliant.
He was listened to with wrapt attention
by every member of the board. At his
conclusion Engineer Hood took the Ter
minal's vice-president in hand. The two
fenced, sparred, thrust and parried, not
unlike a couple of boxers battling for a
championship belt.
Mr. Hood acknowledged during the
bont that it was he who had sent to
Washington the telegram to Senator Frye
last spring saying that the anchorage at
San Pedro was bad. Mr. Gibbon had in
his main argument not mentioned Hood
by same.
Mr. Gibbon said It had been unfortunate
erroneous reports had been extensively
circulated to the effect that there was no
holding-ground at San Pedro. This state
ment waÂ» emphatically made by Senator
Frye in Washington, and based on that
theory, it was asserted, the Southern Pa
cific abandoned its $3,000,000 worth of
property at San Pedro and expended
$i, 000,000 on a wharf at Santa Monica.
Continuing, Mr. Gibbon went into
an elaborate argument against build
ing a deep-water harbor at Sauta
Monica. He reiterated the statement,
many times made, that the land along the
water line at Santa Monica was owned
either by the Southern Pacific Company
or the Jones and Baker estates.
Mr. Gibbon argued that the holding on
this frontage was a virtual monopoly that
was thoroughly protected by the laws
of California. If a harbor were built at
Santa Monica, no company could be on an
equal footing with the Southern Pacific.
It might be possible for a rival company
to gain a land approach to the harbor by
condemnation of a small strip; but it was
evident that no private individual would
ever attempt to construct a wharf out into
the proposed harbor. The expense would
not be undertaken.
Mr. Gibbon argued that the building of
wharves at Santa Monica sufficient to
handle any considerable business would
cost as much as tbe proposed harbor it
self. He pointed out the advantage the
Southern Pacific eained by constructing
its wharf at Santa Monica.
"A great veal has been said, "he remarked,
"of the advantage gained by the com
paratively short distance between Los
Angeles and the proposed harbor at Santa
Monica. The figures, however, show that
San Pedro is but 1.70 miles farther away
than Santa Monica, and this extra dis
tance is equalized by the grade that favors
the former place."
Mr. Gibbon declared that the railroad
facilities at San Pedro were far superior to
those afforded at Santa Monica, and this
condition could not possibly be changed.
The recorJs of the holdings of property at
San Pedrj proved the Southern Pacific
did not and could not monopolize harbor
frontage. The topography of the country
around San Pedro Bay precluded any
possibility of a monopoly. The railroads
now doing business in this vicinity and
those that might hereafter come here,
save the Southern Pacific Company, felt
that it would be to toe best interests of
commerce that the deep-see harbor be
constructed at San Pedro.

presentation of San Pedro's case.
TO ADVERTISE CALIFORNIA.
Scheme to Rear an Arch of Fruit in
Washington Before McKinley's
Inauguration.
STOCKTON, Cal., Dec. 29.â Colonel
Henry G. Shaw of this city has originated
a unique idea for paying a delicate tribute
to the office of President of the United
States, and at the same time advertising
in an artistic and effective manner the re
sources of California.
Ay, least 500,000 people will witness the
inauguration of President-elect McKin
lc-y, and on March 4 next Washington
City will be in winter gala attire.
Colonel Shaw's novel project, toward
the cost of which he has already raised
nearly $500, is tae erection of a California
citrus arch on one of the principal ave
nues of Washington. T.'ie design, a rough
sketch of which has been prepared, pro
vides that the columns, four in number,
shall be completely enveloped by oranges
and lemons. The Dases are to be faced
with California onyx and marble in a style
similar to the front of the Stockton Free
Publ c Library building, the invention of
Architect John Pelton.
The arch itself is to be of dressed Califor
nia redwood, trimmed with other Cali
fornia woods such as the laurel, orange
and tamarack. On top, on either side,
will be exhibited full bearing orange and
lemon trees and in the center a California
grizziy bear rampant. Suspended from
the arch will De a number of crystal
globes, to be tilled with different varieties
of California wines. In each of these an
incandescent light will illuminate the
wine. Legends devoid of any party sig
nificance are to be cut on each face of the
arch. By means of incandesceut lights
concealed within the arch the letters are
to be illuminated. As electric lights are to
be blended with the fruit on the columns
the. effect at nisht is certain to be very
beautiful. Palms and pampas plumes are
also to be used for decorative purposes.
BOLD ROBBERY AT PAISLEY.
Thugs Tie a Blacksmith to His Anvil and
Leave Him There to
Freeze.
PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 29. â Charles
Campbell, a Paisley blacksmith, was the
victim of crmsi robbers Saturday night.
He was despoiled of $700 and narrowly es
caped alive.
Late at night Campbell finished tbe
shoeing of a team of stage horses and was
returning from the baru to his shop, when
two men seized him. He struggled vio
lently, but was thrown on his back by the
thugs. The smith succeeded in arising
and with powerful blows he felled both
robbers. Their recuperative forces were
as great as his and they succeeded in floor
ing him a second time.
Recognizing the strength of their victim
the tuug.t proceeded to iasten one of his
hands to the anvil and the other to a ring
in the wall. Thou he was gagged to pre
vent him from mak.ng any noise. This
done they searched the premises, finding
tbe $700, in gold coin, s-ecreted m the shop.
The robbers evidently were acquainted
with Campbell's habits, else they would
not easily have found his treasure.
Campbell was not found until about 10
o'clock the next day, when some one
heard him kicking the floor, and he was
rescued from his trying position, nearly
frozen to death.
BIRDS RESED BY COTOTES
Farmers XoÂ»Â« Heavily in Sections of
Fremo- County.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec 29. â Tha sheep
men are complaining bitteriy of the
depredations of coyotes in the foothills.
Thousands of the pests are reported to be
scouting the hillsides for food, and mak
ing serious inroads in the sheep herds.
Their nightly choruses are al3O becom
ing a great nuisance. Ever since the
bounty on coyote scalps was repealed the
animals have* increased in numbers at an
nlarming rate, and it is understood <hat
the sheepmen will apply to the Legisla
ture for relief again. Trouble is also ex
perienced in the western portion of the
county. On ono ranch a few days ago
coyotes devoured three new-born colts
and even fought the frenzied mares which
endeavored to protect their young.

CAPTAIN GEORGE
CALEB STRICKEN
Death Claims the Veteran
Navigator at San
Diego.
Was the Only Survivor of the
Wreck of the C ara R.
Suttil.
Served Time in a M?x.can Prison for
an Alleged Infraction of
Revenue Laws *
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 29.â A queer old
character died this morning at the County
Hospital. He was George Caleb, formerly
captain of a Pacific Mail steamer and a
man with an excellent war record. His
age was 62 years.
In 1860 Caleb landed in California and
engaged in shipping. He was the owner of
the bark Clara R. Suttil, which foundered
off this coast twenty-one years ago.
Captain Caleb got away in a small boat
with four sailors and suffered terrible pri
vations. Their food and water gave out,
and Caleb, being smaller than the others,
was fixed upon as a victim whose Mesh
should keep the others alive. He got up
in the bow with a revolver and said he
would kill the first man who crossed a
certain mark.
Later two of the men became crazy and
jumped overboard, and the other two suc
cumbed. Caleb, reduced to a frightful
extremity, dined after they had died. He
was picked up by a steamer, more dead
than alive, and was the only survivor of
the wreck.
During the war Caleb commanded a sup
ply-boat in Southern waters, most of the
time under Farragut. At the battle of
Mobile he did gallant service and was in
jured by a shell. He served for three
years and then returned to California.
He ran sailing vessels down the lower
coast and made money, but through un
scrupulous associates lost it.
In 1884 he was arrested at La Paz and
his schooner, the Adriana, confiscated for
an alleged infraction of the revenue laws.
Caleb served eighteen months in prison
and afterward entered a claim azainst the
Mexican Government, which is otill
pending.
Caleb in 1888 sailed the brig Tropic Bird,
of which he was owner, to Ensenada and
there lost it through a series of misfor
tunes and swindles. The old man saw
many adventures during bis thirty years
of seafaring, and was engaged in writing
his autobiography when he died.
BOLD PORTLAND THUGS.
Rcb a Woman and Her Escort at a
Revolver's Point on a Thickly
Peopled Street.
PORTLAND. Ob., Dec." 29.â For bold
ness, and daring audacity a holdup last
night at the corner of Thirteenth and
Jefferson streets eclipses anything that
has yet occurred during the present
epidemic of lawlessness that is sweeping
over Portland. On a thickly peoDled
thoroughfare under the broad glare of an
arc light and immediately in front of a
large boarding-house, at the early hour of.
7:30. two people, a man and a woman,
who have so far failed to report their
identity, were halted and relieved of their
valuables.
The inmates of Mrs. Percy's boarding
house, directly across the street, were
witnesses of the deed. The woman's
shrieks Drought them all to the door in
time to *cc one man thrust a pistol
toward the face of the woman and seize
ncr watch. This he passed to his com
panion, at the same moment turning
the weapon upon her escort. They bo<h
started to run.
On nearing the corner of the street, '.he
man with the watch turned and shorted
to his companion. "Shoot himl shoot
him!" The rear man turned but did not
fire, and soon they were lost in darkness.

Methods of Improving Educational
Work Discussed in the
Convention.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 29.â The attend
ance at to-day's sessions of the California
Teachers' Association was larger than
ever before in the history of the organiza
tion. A great many educators arrived on
the late trains last night and early this
morning, and when the convention was
called to order at 10 o'clock in Normal
Hall the place was crowded.
Tne exercises of the convention were
carried on in four rooms, and these were
all well filled. In room E the question of
"Child Study in the Schools" and its
allied subjects were taken up. Milicent
W. Shinn of Niles presided. Owing to the
crowded condition of the room an adjourn
ment was taken to the Assembly Hail.
â¢ The first subject was "Limitations and
Cautions in Child Study" by Dr. E. E.
Brown of Berkeley. He gave the asso
ciation much good advice derived from
experience and study. Professor Earl
Barnes of Stanford told of "Methods ol
Child Study With Reference to Practicaf
Application." Both oi the addresses were
in the nature of practical talks to the
teachers, and had their close attention.
Dr. W. T. Harris of Washington, D. C,
United States Commissioner of Educa
tion, was introduced and gave a short talk
on child study and how to train the child
for the best results. Dr. Nora L. Pratt of
Boston, the distinguished writer and
teacher, spoke on "Physical Applications
of Child Study." She said no success could
be expected with the blood in tbe child cir
culating feebly. Her remarss were de
voted to the physical nature of the child.
Dr. Stratton of the fJniversity of Califor
nia and Dr. Bolton discussed the general
subject.
"Possibilities of Systematic Application
in School and Kindergarten, " with the
sub-topic, "The Tompkins School," was
treated by Mrs. Francis B. Gould of Oak
land. She read a carefully prepared pa
per embracing features- of this line of
work. Dr. TJ. B. B. Dresser spoke of
"Normal Schools" in connection with the
general subjpet.
President Jordan of Stanford was intro
duced. He said that science was to teach
us what was best and how to live; to give
us wisdom. All science and all wisdom
was to show us what was best. The edu
cation of the child should be to show it
what was best in order that it could live
best. That was education.
The subject "Mathematics :n the
Scnool" was considered in room K. Here
Professor Melvin W. Haskeil of Berkeley
was chairman. There were two sub-topics.
The first was "In What Direction Might
the Mathematical Course in the Lower
Schools Be Improved?" Second, "Ad
vantages and Delects of the Grube
System."
B. S. Holway opened the discussion.
J. B. Hickman of Monterey, C. H. Allen
of the State Normal nere, 8. W. Chambers
of Oakland and numerous others took
part. The room was cemforabiy filled
and those interested in this work proved
that they were enthusiasts.
"Art in the Primary and Secondary
Schools" was treated in the hall of the
training department upstairs. Mrs. Cor
delia P. Bradtield of Los Angeles was
chairman. Mrs. Bradfieid read a paper
on "Object and lnventional Drawing in
Primary Schools." Mrs. Amelia Griffith
of SanFrancipco treated "Drawing from
the Standpoint of a School Principal." A.
B. Clark of Stanford talked of "Metnod in
Perspective." Miss M. Van Vleck of the
Commercial School of San Francisco read
a paper on "Principles of Design." Miss
Katuerine Adams of Mayneid had an
essay on "Teaching Desi^nini:." Others
who bad sub-topics were P. O. Garin of
Oakland and Miss Martha Patterson oi the
Cogswell College.
"History in the Primary and Secondary
Schools" neld m* floor in the lower train
ing-halL Mrs. R. V. Wmterburn of StocK
ton was chairman. 1 here were many sub
topics on this interesting subject aad
many features were considered. Among
those joining in the uiscussion were: Dr.
E. E. Brown. P. E. Perham, E. M. Cox,
MissSissons, Miss E. S. Smythe, Mrs. M.
G. Hood, C. H. Keys, Miss E. Packard. H.
D. Sheldon. M. F.'Hali, Miss. Anna Koh
ler, Miss P. O'Meara and others. Tnese
subjects completed the programme of the
morning session.
The general session of the association
in the main assembly hail iv the afternoon
attracted a large attendar.ee, end the pro
ceedings proved to be very interesting and
lively at times. After calling the meeting
to order President Linscott announced the
following committee on resolutions: T.
B. Bailey of BerKeley. D. C. Clark of Santa
Cruz, F. A. Gardner of San Francisco, C.
B. Towle of Vallejo, O. E. Graves of Red
Biuff and D. A. Moblev of Stockton.
President Linscott then called attention
to a State song, v.ords and music by Miss
Josephine Gro, a popular composer of Los
Angeles. The song is entitled "Hail Cal
ifornia." The literary as well 83 the mu
sical merit of the song is highly com
mended and warmly indorsed by eminent
educational officials, and by those of equal
standing in musical, professional and
legislative positions.
Mrs. Hillman-Snuth sang the "Maids of
Cadiz," by Leo Delibes, with very fine
effect. Sbe was encored and responded
with "Tit for Tat."
The election of officers of the associa
tion for the ensuing year was t en de
clared in order. Nominations for presi
dent of the ai.iociation were called for
and the result was quite a breeze in tbe
proceedings, a spirited contest which was
evidently not expected or intended by
those interested.
The chair announced that no nominat
ing speeches would be allowed.
Professor Barnes of Stanford University
arose and placed State Superintendent S.
T. Black in nomination. There were sev
eral second?. Superintendent Davis of
Sonoma County placed L. J. Cbipman in
nomination, with the remark that he bad
served as a county superintendent for
more years than any other man in Cali
fornia. The nomination was received
with a storm of applause and there were
many seconds from all parts of trie bouse.
Balloting was about to be-in when Pro
fessor Barnes arose and said lie under
stood that Superintendent Black did not
wish to be a candidate. F. D. Faulkner
of San Francisco protested against the
withdrawal of the name of Superintendent
Black unless he was present to authorize
it. The balloting then proceeded, and
while the teller* irere engaged in the
count the election oi two vice-presidents
was taken up.
W. H. Langdon of San Leandro, James
A. Barr of Stockton and Professor Elmer
Brown of Berkeley were nominated. Tbe
latter declined to be a candidate and W.
H. Langdon and J. A. Barr were elected.
For secretary, the incumbent, Miss
Anna C. Murphy of Berkeley, was placed
in nomination, but she declined. Miss
Allie M. Feiker of San Jose was nom
inated by Superintendent Madison Bab
cock of San Francisco. Others nominated
for the position were: J. W. Graham of
Kings County, iV. P. Hall, E. K. Barthell,
Mrs. .Margaret G. Hood of Stanford. Miss
Felser attempted to decline the nomina
tion, but pro-ests were heard from all over
tbe house. At the same time there was a
landslide to her, as all the other nominees
for the office declined in her favor. She
was elected. Miss Feiker is a critic teacher
in tne State Normal School in this city.
W. F. Hall of Berkeley, the incumbent,
declined the nomination for assistant sec
retary. Franklin Barthell of Morgan Hill
was nominated. Cecil Marks of San
Francisco was named, but he refused to
be a candidate and i ran&iin Bartbell was
declared elected.
For the remaining two offices the in
cumbents were elected as tollows: Rail
road secretary, J. \\ . McClymonds, Oak
land; treasurer, Bessie G. Haslam, Santa
Cruz.
The contest for . President had been a
spirited one, considerable work having
been done upon the floor by the friends of
the two candidates. It was announced
that the tellers were ready to report F.
D. Faulkner, principal of the Faulkner
Grammar Scnool in San Francisco, moved
that the elec ion be deferred until it could
be ascertained definitely who were mem
bers of the association and entitled to vote.
"I do not believe that any teachers here
would so far forget themselves and the
honor that they should preserve in their
profession as to cast a vote if they were
not eligible to do sc," remarked President
Linscott. "If they cast il egal ballots
here they should give up their certificates
as soon as they return home. It would
not be possible for the secretary to compile
the roll of membership until the middle
of next week."
With this announcement the attempt to
postpone the election was abandoned and
tne result was announced. Tbe total
number of votes was 462. L. J. Chip
man received 236 votes aud S. J. Black
222, scattering 4. Chipman was declared
elected. The result was greeted with warm
applause.
All of tne newly elected officers of the
State association are members 01 the Nor
mal School Alumni Association of San
Jose exceDt two â James A. Barr of Oak
land, one of the vice-presidents, and J. W.
McClymonds of Oakland, the railroad sec
retary.
Mr. Chipman was introduced as the new
president "of the State Association. He
ieeiingly expressed iiis regret that there
had been a contest for tbe office, and he
also regretted that Superintendent Black
had not been successful in tbe Contest,
Superintendent Black also was intro
duced and be, too, expressed regret at the
position in which he hau been placed be
fore the association. He said he had on
several former occasions rafused to be a
candidate, and he had positively refused
when approached to allow his name to be
presented on this occasion.
The speaker said the action in keeping
bis name before the association after it
was announced that he did not wish to be
a candidate was ill advised and he re
gretted it, and also that there had Deen a
contest.
The selection of a place for holding the
next session of the association was de
clared in order. Ex-S;ate Superintendent
Swett placed San Francisco in nomina
tion. There were a number of seconds to
this motion, and as there was no opposi
tion the ballot was ordered cast for th at
city by the secretary.
State Superintendent Black led the dis
cussion of tbe report of the Council of
Education. The report was prepared by
a committee of five of the council consist
ing of J. W. Linscott, Miss Lucy L. Wash
burn, P. M. Fisher. Washington Wilson
and Elmer E. Brown. The latter was the
secretary of toe committee, and he read
the report upon the subject, "The New
California Movement in Elementary Edu
cation."
It is explained that the Teachers' As
sociation had for ten years under earnest
and constant consideration some means
to bring about needed reforms in the
course of study in the elementary grades.
In this California was in the advance, and
it was predicted that grand results would
flow from a continuation of investigations
and efforts along this important line.
Remarks upon the subject under dis
cussion were made by Professor O. P.
Jenkins of Stanford, Professor Washing
ton Wilson of the Chtco Normal School,
Professor T. B. Bailey of the University of
California and Dr. W. T. Harris.
There was a very large attendance at
the session to-night, when an address was
delivered upon "Moral Education and
School Discipline" by W. T. Harris,
LL.D., United States Commissioner of
Education, of Washington, D. C.
The effort was an able one, and produced
a fine impression unon the great audience
that taxed the full seating and standing
capacity; of the main assembly-room of
the Normal School. The speaker pointed
out the manner in which the schoolroom
affected moral character and the difference
between intellectual and moral education.
Moral instruction, it was urged, should
secure in pupils tbe development of cor
rect habits. A correct habit of thinking
toward the moral would lead to correct
moral practices.
â¢'The best help that one can give nis fel
lows, " said the speaker, "is that which en
ables them to help themselves. The best
school is that which makes pupils able to
teach themselves. The best instruction in
morality makes the pupil a law unto him
self. Hence strictness, wnich is indispen
sible, must be tempered Dy such devices as
cause tbe pupils to love and obey the law
for the law's sake.''
The speaker was applauded at the close
of his address.

INUNDATED LANDS
Owners of Swamp Tracts
Draft a Memorial to
the Governor.
Ask for a Large Appropriation
for the Improvement of
Waterways.
Would Make tbe Capital a Seaport
by Dredging tbe Sacramento
River.
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Dec. 2aâSwamp
land owners of California convened in this
city to-day for the ostensible purpose of
considering the b?st method of clearing
the river-beds so that the waters could
flow from their source to the sea without
rambling all over the country. The
meeting tended to exemplify to the pub
lic what a vast fund of figures and statis
tics had been gathered by the members
of the Board of Public Works, and how
more than necessary it was deemed to be
that that same commission be kept in
office.
Commissioner of Public Works Leake
reviewed tne work done under his super
vision and touched upon the further needs
of hi* department. He said tnere was
722,240 acres of unreclaimed land lying in
the Sacramento Valley, an increase of over
200,000 acres since 186 L He demonstrated
what an enormous income tbe State would
derive could this land be brought under
cultivation.
Touching upon the objection raised in
some quarters that the State would be
asked to defray the expenses incurred in
the reclamation of overflowed lands, Com
missioner Leake stated that while tbe tax
roll of the State would be greatly in
creased it was for the Legislature to de
termine upon whom should fall the bur
den of expense.
The cut throuch the Montezuma hills,
advocated and proposed two years ago as
tne most ieasible solution of the problem,
is declared impracticable. The cost of
such an enterprise is an insuperable ob
jection. Under tha most favorable cir
cumstances, this work could not be com
pleted for less than $4,500,000. Thid in
cludes the cost of tbe construction of the
canal channel from tne Yolo basin to the
MtHiezuma hills.
With tne prospect of incumboring their
property to such an extent the people
would never consent to putting such a
scheme into operation. The Commis
sioner declared that the deepening of the
river and the correction of the channel
was the only practicable solution. The
Bates hydraulic dredger made such a
project practicable. By its use a channel
forty feet wide and twenty feet deep could
be cut, tbe appliance going through a
sandbar at the rate of ten feet per minuje.
The river couid be made navigable at all
seasons of the year from Red Bluff to the
bay, the cost being calculated with em
blematical precision. He concluded by
strongly advocating the purchase of this
dredger, an opinion which was backed by
that of Will S. Green, United States Sur
veyor.
J. W. Ferric, an old dredger man, was
inclined to be more conservative in his de
mands, and believed that if too lar^e a
sum was asked for it mignt tend to defeat
the whole scheme.
'The Bates dredger will not do as much
as you hope for," he added. "It was con
structed for removing shoals and sand
bars, but when roots and bard substances
are to be dealt with a hydraulic dredger
will not be very effective."
After further discussion on the subject it
was agreed to apuo;ut an advisory com
mittee of twenty-five and an executive
committee of five, and the following were
selected:
Advisoryâ W. A. Gert, chrirman; E. B. Pond,
Dr. lieorge A. Moore, Frederick Zeile, Hugh J.
Corcoran, General T. W. Bheehan, Hon.
Dwight Hollister, J. H. Glide, Hon. Marion de
Vries, Joseph Desrosler, George L, Clark, R. T.
Berlin, Colonel George Hagar, George K.
Williams. A. H. Wilbur, Thomws W. Dean, R.
P. Robbins, John C. White, Jesse Poundstone,
Thomas J. Mumma, W. E. Gerber, F. T. Dwyer,
James O'Xeil, George R. Vealc, James Sul
livan.
Executive committeeâ A. T. J. Reynolds of
Courtland, chairman; M. J. itoggs, Colusa; L.
D. Green, Courtland; A. C. B.ngham, Marys
ville; Sol Bunyon, Courtland.
Mr. Stevenson was made a member of
each committee.
Ihe committee on memorials and reso
lutions submitted a memorial addressed
to Governor Budd, which in brief stated
that the petitioners were deeply interested
in tbe improvements of the navigable
waters of the State. The Capital City, by
reason of agricultural interests, shou d be
the common center of commerce, and the
second, if not the first, city in point of
commercial interest in the State; but
owing to the present condition of naviga
tion no vessels exceeding three feet
draught could reach Sacramento.
By improving the Sacramento river,
they declared, it could he made a com
mercial highway, and Sicramento city a
seaport, and there could be docked at the
city front sea-poing vessels of twenty-feet
draught and over. After setting forth the
reason.-* for this condition of the river,
such us breaks in the leves, etc., tne mem
orial says:
Whfle it is the duty of the Federal Govern
ment to take charge of, preserve and improve
the navigable waters of California, it is the
duty also of the State of California to protect
itself. It will require no argument to show
the vast benefit that will accrue to the State of
California in the way of increased commerce,
and in adding to the taxable wealth of tbe
SLate, by inaugurating a system of improve
ment that will enable tne navigable rivers of
California to take care of trie waters that
reach them, and to become permauent high
ways of commerce.
Fortunately lor tbe State, a plan of river im
provement has been recommended by the
honorable Commissioner of Public Works
which in many respects, If not In all, affords a.
solution of this vexed question. Ail the In
terests of the State of California can unite in
obtaining legislation that will rectify tbe
rivers and improve them as channels of com
merce. The most pressing necessity at the
present time U the improvement of the
fcincramento River between Fremont and the
mouth of the >Â»crameuto River, one-half mile
below CollinsVille, which can be done in ac
cordance with the views expressed by tue
Commissioner of Public Works, by means of a
dredger. In removing the shoals at Newton
and the construction of a restraining wall
from the foot ot Grand Island to Wood Island,
about a distance of two and a half miles.whioh
work, in iccordance with, the report of the
Hon. Eiward E. Leake, Commissioner of Pub
lic Worts of this State, tan be accomplished.
For the reasons sta;ed we urgently request
you to make an appropriation of a sufficient
sum of money to be expended by the Commis
sioner of Public Works or other competent
authority for this purpose. And we als<>
earnestly request you to take such measures
as may be necessary to secure the co-operation
of the Federal Government with the State in
this improvement.

YOLO COUNTY INSTITUTE.
Farmers and University of California
Educators Discuss Agricultural
Topics.
WOODLAND. Cal., Dec. 29.â The meet
ing held in this city to-day to organize a
Farmers' Institute, to work in co-opera
lion with the State Institute, was fairly
well attended. Professor Wickson and Dr.
Louridge of the University of California
and R. C. Irwin of the State Bureau of
Highways were present and contributed
much to the success of tbe meeting.
The session was opened by Professor
Wickson, who stated its object and gave a
brief account of the good that had already
been accomplished through the society
and the benefits that couid be derived if
the proper interest was shown. The ob
ject of these institutes, which originated
in tbe State University, was to congregate
the agricultural people for the discussion
of their interests. In this manner every
body was benefited, he said, and the uni
versity representative could also learn as
well as instruct.
Mr. Wickson was followed by Mr. Irwin,
who spoke on public highways. He pointed
out tbe necessity of builmn substantial
highways as a matter of economy. He
said that $431,000 had been expended in
YoloCounty on roads in the past fouryears.
and called attention totheird^plorablecon
dition at the present time. Sprinkling of
the county roads was advocated. Hi* ad
dress was followed by a general discus
sion, in which a large majority of those
present participated.
Dr. Louridge was next introduced. His
subject was "Tne Relation of the Plant to
tbe Earth." His discourse was from a
scientific point of view and was ably
handled.
The attendance at the evening session
was small, but mat was because of the
inclemency of the weather, which pre
vented many of the agricultural people
from attending from the surrounding
country. Mrs. A. A. Merritt read an
es^ay on floriculture, which had been
chosen as the subject for the evening.
Professor Wickson also read a valuable
paper. Each paper was followed by a
general discussion.
Toe session heM to-day opened with an
increased attendance. The following pa
pers were read : "Practical Dairying," J.
Y. Dilion; "Better Cows for Better
Dairies," Professor Wickson; "Faulty
Soils and Their Treatment, Including
Fertilization," Dr. Louridge* "Changes
in Pruning," Professor Wickson.
SAVES A LIFE AT MONTEREY.
Mexican Woman Cures a Poisoned Man
After Fhysicians Had Surren
dered Hzpe.
MONTEREY, Cal., Dec. 29.â At this
season oi the year in old Monterey it is
quite a custom during Christmas week for
the Spanish and Mexican element of tbe
population to gather mushrooms every
morning. All varieties of toadstools are
abundant in this locality, too, and there
is one kind that resembles tbe mushroom
so closely that it takes an expert to tell
the difference. Most of the families put a
silver coin in the pot while cooking what
they have gathered, and if the coin turnÃ
black they know the mushrooms art> of
the poisonous variety. Many people here
eat them raw, however, just as they find
them in tbe field. As a result a great
many have beeu poisoned by eating toad
stools.
There is an old Mexican woman livins;
in Monterey who knows a cure, but is
quite superstitious and will not divulge
tbe secret, claiming as a reason that if she
does not administer the medicine herself
it will have no effect. How true this ia
no oue has ever been able to learn; but,
at any rate, Carlos Vaidez, a citizen of
Monterey, was cured by this old woman
several days ago, when the doctors had
given him up, and he is now perfectly
well.
Vaidez says he was gathering mush
rooms on Saturday raornin? and was eat
ing them raw. He ate perhaps a dozen,
when one seemed to taste better than tbe
rest; but a few minutes after he ate it he
suffered an acute pain in the stomach.
The pain grew more intense, and by the
time he reached his home he was in
agony. Medical aid was summoned and
antidotes given the sufferer, but no ap
parent relief was derived from the medi
cine. His extremities were cold and to
all appearances there was no life in his
body.
The old Mexican woman came to his
relief with a sort of herb tea. Its effect
was soon evident in the convulsions by
which is system threw off the poison.
Valdez's suffering was intense, although
he was apparently unconscious. His body
writhed in agony, and it was several hours
before a decided change occurred. Medi
cal aid was acain summoned and resusci
tation assured. Vaidez is now a well
man.
Wnfiniiri/^ Ranch Transfer.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal.. Dec. 29.â One of
the finest berry and smali fruit ranches in
Santa Cruz County has passed into the
possession of the People's Bank of this
city. The property consists of about
ninety acres of improved land, a t>art ot
the celebrated Lake farm uear Wataon
ville. Thoma3 Stewart died leaving the
property somewhat involved and though
his widow, Letitia Stewart, received a
rental of $1500 a year from the farm, she
seemed uuaoie to keep up the interest on
the $10 000 mortgage. The property is
considered one of the best in the Pajaro
Valley and toe price at which it wa3
bought in by the bank â $11,979, covering
principal and inter st, together with court
costs and other expenses â is considered
less than half its value even at the present
low prices of real estate.

SHOOTING AFFRAY
AT GRASS VALLEY
Dr. C. W. Jones Fires Five
Times at Teamster
Horan.
One Bullet Take? Fffect in the
Wrist of His Intended
Victim.
Tbe Jehu Accus d of Alienating the
Aff.ctions of tht. Physician's
Wife-
GRASS VALLEY, Cal.. Dec, 29.-Dr.
C. W. Joues shot at Thomas Horan, a
teamster, from the porch of his residence,
on Auburn street, last evening, and in
flicted a wound that will cause his victim
annoyance for some time to come. The
shooting was the result of a domestic
scandal, the physician accusing Horan oi
having alienated the affections of M 3 wife.
He encountered Horan in front of his
residence, and after a sharp quarrel fired
at him five times.
One of the shots took effect in Horan's
right arm, the bullet entering at the wrist
and lodging in the back of the band.
Horan lost no time in getting out of
range. He ran along Auburn street and
up Main to the home of his sister, Mrs. J.
M. Manning.
Dr. Jones walked up to the office of
Justice Trebilcox, where he acknowledged
he bad shot Horan. No formal charge
was lodged against him, but he was bound
over by Justice Trebilcox under bonds of
$iOOO to appear when his case might be
called for examination.
Such in brief is the story of last night's
occurrence so far as the suriace facts are
concerned. Of course there was a motive
for the act. It was the impulse of a hus
band who believed himself grievously
wronged, and who had proof that such
was the case.
He had invited Horan to follow him to
his house, there to establish the innocenca
of those most concerned. When this
could not be done, in his rage he shot at
Horan, not with the intention of killing
him, but to inflict a wound that would
cause Horan great pain. Horan's wound
is not serious.
MORTGAGES FILED AT T A CO MA
Two Instruments to Secure Bond Issues
for Three Hundred and Twenty
Millions.
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec 29.â Two mort
gages â the largest ever filed in the State â
were recorded in the King County Audi
tor's office yesterday. They were apparently
arranged by the reorganization committee
of the Northern Pacific to secure bond is
sues, provided for by that body, amount
ing to $320,000,000. First came a deed
from the Northern Pacific Railroad con
veyino'all its lands to the Northern Pa
cific Railway; then the Farmers' Loan
and Trust Company, as trustee, deeded to
the Northern Pacific Railway all property
of the Northern Pacific Railroad, held in
trust; then tnere was a deed from Master
in-Chancery Carey to the Northern Pacific
Railway Company of all property of the
Northern Pacific Railroad, and lastly a
deed from Receivers McHenry, Bigelow
and Burleieh, to tbe Northern Pacific
Railway Company of all property of the
Northern Pacific Railroad Company held
by them.
Foliowine these came record mortgages
from the Northern Pacific Railway Com
pany to tbe Mercant.le Trust Company
and to the Farmers' Loan and Trust Com
pany of New Yorlc. The first of these was
for $130,000,000, to the Mercantile Trust
Company, covering all property in this
county and other counties, to secure
bonds bearing 4 per cent interest; the
second mortgage was to the Farmers'
Loan and Trust Company, as trustee, and
covers all property in King County and
elsewhere belonging to tne Northern Pa
cific Railway Company. It is for $190,
-000,000. This is a second or subsidiary
mortgage, and is t-iven to secure, as a gen
eral lien, railroad and land grant gold
bonds which bear 3 per cent.
INDIANS TO BE EJECTED.
Aqua Caliente Tribe Losss Its Ancestral
Home on the Rancho San Jose
del Valle.
BAN DIEGO, Gal., Dec. 29.â Judge
Pierce to-day rendered a decision quieting
title to the Rancho San Jose del Valie,
embracing 27,000 acres and being part of
(he great Warner's ranch in this county.
A writ ot ejectment as prayed for was
granted against the defendants â thd Aqua
Caliente Indians.
The case was brought originally by ex-
Governor John G. Downey several years
ago and cominued by J. Downey Harvey,
bis administrator. The Indians claimed
the land as their ancestral home, which
they bad occupied from time immemorial
as a headquarters.
The Indian village is situated at the
Aqua Caliente Hot Springs which are
locally famous for tneir curative
properties. The man who fought
the case for the Indians was
their chief, Alejandro Barker, a very
intelligent Indian, who employed the best
legal talent and succeeded while be was
alive in preventing tne ejectment of nis
people. He died six months aero and
there was no one of sufficient ability to
take his place.
The case is in soms respects a sad one,
revealing again the inevitable passing
away of the Indian- and the loss of their
homes. The rancho San Jose del Valle,
teeming with herds, was until recently
t.ie unquestioned range of the Indians, but
the settlers moving in confined the natives
to smaller and smaller territory until the
remnant of the tribe was confined to a
little place surrounding tne springs, and
by the decision rendered to-day is not
even to retain that as a home.
Qrapeland District Contest.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal , Dec. 29.â
Land owners in Grapeland Irrigation
district are preparing to contest the bonds
of the district. Judge McKinley of Los
Anzeles recently decided that the district
Lad no right to water being developed by
tunneling under the bed of Lyttle Creek.
The bond-holders refuse to aid in carry
ing the case to a higher court, and the
land-owners question the validity of the
bonds on the ground that the district did
not receive 90 cents on a dollar, hs required
by law. A rictitious sale, it is claimed.
was niade to a man named Maddern, but
the district was not paid a dollar on the
deal. Thirty-three thousand dollars in
bonds were manipulated by Hotchkiss &
Daniel.-, brokers, who purchased a tract
of worthless land. Other methods were
resorted to to evade the 90-cent clause.
Mammy Pleaaants Sued for 91300.
Conrad P. Herman has sued Mary Â£. Pleas
ants for $1200 which he says Is Aneoji ec
count of nursing the late Frederick Bell 150

Pleusants promised to pay the bill to' nurhlll f
Bell, but that she now refuses to come to a

siderable prominence at the tome of tbe.au of

DAVIS SLOUGH DISPUTE.
Word Keceived From Washington Rela
tive to the Duck-Huutins;
Stream*.
At last woid has been received from tbe
chief of the legal department at Washing
ton upon the matter of the obstructions
in Davis Slough, in the San Pablo
marshes, placed there by a Â©reserve cluo.
The iollowing brief infctruc;ions w< re re
ceived: That the Government will not
interfere in ihe Davis Slough matter un
less the slough is obstructed to naviga
tion; that th' Government will not take a
hand in any quarrel among hunting or
ganizations. The same dispatch directed
the United Sta.es Attorney to investigate
and ascertain if Davis Slough is a n;Â»vis:a
ble body of water and if it is obstructed.
It is safe to say that tne Sportsmen's Pro
tective Association will not regard tnis as
a victory.
THE ELECTION ATTACKED.
Legality of the Kejjistraiion of Voters
Called in Question.
The much-talked-ot leeal struggle to
keep the recently elected City officers out
of their offices has finally narrowed down
toa^uit by Edward L. Wagner, Super
visor for the Twelfth Ward, against
Thomas W. Rivers, who was elected to
ti e offit eof Supervisor for that ward at
the recent election.
The proceedings were instituted by
Thomas E. Curran and George H. Fran
coeur, attorneys for Wagner, and the
point on which they rely is that Registrar
of Voters Hinton erred when he closed
registration of voters on the 4th of
August and refused to permit what is
known as precinct registration after that
date. Because of this alleged misconduct
on the part of the Registrar, the court is
asked to declare the entire election illegal
and null and void. In that event ail the
newly elected officers would be knocked
out.
Presiding Judge Belcher issued an order
in conformity with the prayer of tbe
complaint restraining Mr. Rivers from at
tempting to take his office and requiring
him on the 11th of next month to show
cause why t^is order should not be made
perpetual.
This scarcely means that Mr. Rivers
will fail to take his seat on the 4t > of next
month, as he will probably make suffi
cient showing before t;iat time to secure a
modification of the court's order, leaving
tbe adjudication of rights involved to the
future.
Amon"Â» lawyers it is considered that
Attorneys Curran and Francoeur have
chosen the strongest method of attack
that was open to them, but it is argued
that it is scarcely to be expect-d that a
court will set aside and annul an elec
tion, even though some pubiic officer has
failed to perform his duty, which may or
may not be true in mis case. For in
stance, in tbe State of Washington re
cently the Supreme Court ot that com
monwealth upheld an election wben no
registration of voters had been had, al
though tne law requiring registration was
similar to the law of California in that re
spect. Other cases of similar import are
cited to show that courts hesitate to over
throw the expression of public will at the
polls, and that it is difficult to reverse the
decision of tbe voters as expressed through
their ballots.
NO OFFICIAL MAP
Payment to Mr. Tilton Stopped by Mr.
Dajrwalt's Lawsuit.
The City and County of San Francisco
may not have a new official map after all,
as George W. Daywalt has instituted suit
to prevent Treasurer A. C. Widber from
paying $7000 or any otner sum to Charles
S. Tilton, Surveyor and Engineer for the
City, on account of the new map of the
City and County of San Francisco.
As a primary cause for having the pay
ment stopped, Mr. Daywalt alleges that
Mr. Tilton is not entitled to any extra
compensation for making tbe map, ttiat
he is paid a salary of $50 a month, and
that this is to bu in full compensation for
his services.
Judge Belcher, sitting as Presiding
Judge of tiie Superior Court, signed an
order restraining Treasurer Widber from
paying |7000 or |10,000 or any other sum
until an adjudication of the entire matter
can be uad.
A MYSTERY ENDED.

LIT LAMPS AND
BURNED RED FIRE
All Larkin Street Cele
brated Its New Found
Splendor.
Eusiness Men in Line With
Bands and Wagons and
Bunting.
Some cf the Decorations in Honor of
the V ctory Over Dark
ness.
Bathed in a flooil of crimson light from
wagons carrying a plentiful supply of red
fire, with Roman candles shooting toward
; the sky and bursting into glaring radi
. ance, with the band playing martial airs
and thousands of people elbowing and
jostling one another in a determined at
tempt to reach the best point of vantage
to view the scene, the celebration of
Lai kin street's new system of 'arc lights
waÂ« inaugurated.
It was a great occasion for rejoicing, and
the merchants and tradesmen along that
thoroughfare did not neglect it. It meant
for them a new era i:i busine&s. and they
realized it to the utmost.
Early in the evening the lights were
turned on, and at once what before had
been a street enveloped in semi-darkness
was changed into a modern line of trade.
' The brilliancy was contagious; everybody
. was laughing and irav.
'â¢ "What's the matter with Larkin street?"
It was the shrill yell of a proud urchin
astride tae crosspiece of the telegraph-pole
in front of Dr. Ed Hill's drugstore. Amid
a choruÂ« of answering yells to the effect
' that "Larkin street's all right" the pro
cession, which had former at the inter
" section of Larkin and Sutter streets, the
northern ex:r.?mity of the string of arc
lights, got under way and started south
ward.
When the first strains of the band burst
uron tne ear of the vast crowd assembled
on tne street, tne effoct was in itself eloc
tri<ai. Cheers rent the air, hats were
to-sed ap, and handkerchiefs waved. In
brief, it was pandemonium.
At the head of the procession came h.
wagon filled with an indiscriminate mix
ture of youngsters and red fir<\
Bvryih'DÃ in the line of march assumed
n ruddy tint. Then came a buegy with
top iowered and gayly decorated with flags
r. nrt Japanese lanterns, containing Dr.
E. E. Hill, president of the Larkin-street
I:n rovement Club, and Secretary Charles
B. Jacobs.
The buggy was closely followed by a
large covered bus drawn by four iron-gray
hordes, containing the Letter-carriers'
b:;ijd. The supports of the bus were
w.apped with red, white and blue hunt
ing, and on each side was pinned a large
< anvas sheet bearing the inscription. "We
G.vt- You Light. Give Us Your Patron
ape."
The band wagon immediately preceded
an open carriage in which rode L. 8. Kohn,
president of the Polk-street Improvement
Ciub, and wife, and W. F. Kibley and wife.
Kibiey is a prominent member of the
reception committee of the same club.
The next carriage bore L. Drost and wife
r and L. Quinn and daughter. Drost is the
f secretary of the Polk-street Club, and
Quinn chairman of the executive com
mittee.
The rest of the procession consisted of
decorated wagons of the various business
firms along the street who are members
of the club. Those deserving special men
lion on account of the profuseness of dec
orations on their wagons were: Heine- ( â 
Mann <ft Stern, Sandbeck & Co., C. A,
Bantel and F. A. Reicher.
As the procession moved along Abe
Kohn. dressed to represent Mephistophe
les, and Joseph McKnight stood in front
of Secretary Jacob's candy-store and shot
Roman cand.es into the air. The snme
performance was repeated in front of
President Hill's pharmacy by Thomas
Dolan and Charles Ford. Tiese latter at
times amused themselves by directing
their aim at John Trapet's saloon across
the way, and in self-defense, the good
humored proprietor had temporarily to
"shut up shop."
The procession passed up and down
Larkin street, from Sinter to McAllister,
these beina the extremities of the -string
of lights, four times, stopping occasion
ally in front of some prominent club mem
ber's store for the bund to serenade. It
did not disband till nearly 10 o'clock. The
hupe^bonfires lighted at the intersection
of all'cross streets burned all night. *
After the procession had disbanded the
prominent members of the club were
treated to a serenade by the band. This
did not cease till long after midnight.
One of the most novel ieatures of the
celebration was the decoration of the
streot. All business places along the line
were illuminated with Chinese lanterns
and enlivened with flags and bunting
except one.
That solitary exception was the liquor
store of N. J. Holmberg, on the corner of
Post and Larkin streets. Mr. Holmberg
was the only man who refused to sub c criDe
to the lighting fund, and in consequence,
by order of the club, the side of the li^ht
fronting his establishment was painted
black. So his place remained in Stygian
gloom, and any decorations in it would
have been "out of sight."
The most unique attraction to be seen
along the whole line was in the window
of Secretary Jacob's candy-store. His
little niece, Rose Meyers, a tot of 2 or 3
years, was dressed in tilks and satins,
witii a cub badge p nned on her shoul
der, and placed on :\ little satin throne In
the window, in full view of passers-by.
The vicinity of that window was crowded
constantly, and this p. eased the baby so
that she cooed like a turtle dove.
The decorations along the line of march
were most picturesque.
Neilo Jessen. southwest corner of Sutter and
Larkin Â»ireets, had his p. ace newly p timed
wbite, besides an elaborate display of Japanese
lanterns and American flags.
J. Isacon, chemist and pharmacist, south
west corner of Geary and Larkin streets, bad a
display of electric lights placed in show win
dows and an additional coat of white paint on
the front of his store.
Reinhold Jentzsch's saloon, northeast cor
ner of O'Farrell and Larkin, had a large dis
play of flags of all nations, with streamers and
Japanese lanterns.
F. W. Ricohers, northwest corner of Eddy
and Larkin streets, shone with a tine display
of Japanese lanterns and red, white and b.ue
streamers from the front of tne awning to the
side of the building.
Prosper R. Relter, proprietor of a French
liquor-store on the southeast corner of O'Far
reii and Larkin streets and chairman of the
finance committee which collected the funds
for the general celebration, had a flue display
of bunting, Japanese lanterns and calcium
lights in front oi his store.
Dr. Edward E. Hill, chemist and druggist,
northwest corner of Ellis and Larkin streets,
president ot- the LurJcin-street Improvement
Club,'had a most liberal display of lights and
bunting. His decorations were highly praised.
Dr. Willium T. Kiubler, who ha 9 a drugstore
on the southwest corner oi Eddy and Larkin
street-, had a fine display of bunting and cal
cium lights in front of his premises.
C. S. Jacobs, candies, secretary of the club,
had an excellent ornamentation of Japanese
lanterns and wax candles in li.s w . ndows.
I. W. Harri--, grocer Rnd vice-president of
the club, had a generous display of lights,
flags and Roman undies.
Snyder's icecream snloon was tastefully
decorated. Oscar Moses, glassware and cut
lery, a prominent member of Uie club and
cnairman of the light committee, had a fine
display of illuminations.
A. Newmark's piumbing establishment, M.
Wolf's tailor-shop and Mrs. G. Falkner's corset
factory were well decorated. A. Lewis &
Brother, picture frames and moldings, and
Mark Blum, cream and milk, were wellto the
front. The following were worthy of notice:

RUDOLPH'S GOOD LOCK
Harry E. Leslie's Wound Not
Considered Danger
ous.
The Shooting Was Entire'y Uipro-
Vcked as Several Witnesses
Will Testify.
Jake Rudolph appeared in Judge Joach
imsen's court yesterday to answer a charge
of assault to ruurJer. At the request of
his attorney a continuance was granted
for one weefc.
According to Henry N. Las Key, who was
with Harry E. Leslie at the time he was
shot by Rudolph, the shooting was 'en
tirely unprovoked. Laskey made a state
ment to the police yesterday.
He said he and Leslie were standing
about midnight at Sixteenth and Valen
cia streets when Rudolph accosted them.
He introduced himself and invited them
into a restaurant to have a drink. They
each had whisky and Rudolph, who was
under the influence of liquor, took a big
drink. As they left the restaurant three
young girls, without their hats on, passed
them and they spoke to Laskey.
They all walked to Fif.eenth and Mis
sion streets and stopped at the corner gro
cery. Rudolph, Laskey and Leslie went
I into the grocery and Rudolph wanted to
' put up his watch for six drinks, but the
barkeeper refused. They had the drinks,
the girls remaining outside and Leslie
carrying their drinks out to them on a
tray. They then walked up Fifteenth
street to Valencia, along Valencia to Six
teenth and up Sixteenth toward Guerrero.
When they reached Albion avenue Ru
dolph asked them to stop for a minute
and he would return. He was gone about
five minutes and said he had to go home.
The girls " joshed " him a little and he
got mad. He pulled out his revolver, and
using language that is not heard in cul
tured society, he fired at Leslie, the bullet
striking him in the right leg.
Two of the girls ran away, and Laskey
shielded the third till Rudolph walked
away. Laskey then ran down Sixteenth
street and met Policeman R. F. Graham,
who had beard the shots. Laskey told
Graham that Rudolph had fired the shots,
and Graham started off after him. He
went along Albion avenue and saw Ru
dolph crossing Fifteenth street, Graham
called to him, "Hold on, Jake; I want
you," and Rudolph stopped. Graham
searched him, but could not find the re
volver. He tnen took him to the Seven-,
teenth-sireet station.
At the City Prison yesterday Rudolph
professed to have no recollection of the
phooting and said he Knew of no reason
why be should be arrested. He was visited
by several friends.
A careful search was made yesterday by
the police along the different streets near
the scene ot the shooting for the revolver,
but it could not be found. The supposi
tion is that Rudolph gave it to some
friend before Graham reached him.
Leslie was taken from the City and
County Hospital yesterday to his home at
303J^ Dolores street. The bullet did not
break the bone of bis leg and as a result
the wound is not dangerous.

TRAVELING MEN
MEET AT HOME
Annual Discussion of Af
fairs as Found on the
Road.
President- Elect William McKin
ley Sends the Organization a
Message of Thanks.
Section cf 0 fic.rs to Serve the
Pacific Coast Asscciation Next
Year.
The Pacific Coast Commercial Travel
ers' Association held their annual meet
ing yeÂ»teiday afternodn at Native Sons'
Hall, J. C. Eubanks presiding and A. C.
Baldwin and A. W. Weill officiating as
secretaries.
Prior to the regular order of business
Chairman Eubanks read the following
letter, received by him in response to
a congratulatory message wired to Presi
dent-elect McKinley at the time of his
election :
Mr. J. C. Eubanks, President Pacific Coast Com
mercial Travelers' s Association, San Francisco.
Cal.â My Dear sib: I return ruy hearty thanks
lor your telegraphic message of congrntula
tiou. Yours very truly, W. McKinley.
Tne report of the secretary was received
and heartily indorsed. It shows an in
crease of forty-six members and one of
12000 in finances during the present year.
The membership now is 353 and there is
$10,000 on hand. The payments on death
rates, including $500 entailed in 1895, when
R. Porterfield passed away, was only $1000
this year, A. D. Simpson being the other
uaveler who pushed his way beyond all
commercial limits. But $115 was expended
irom the relief fund.
The secretary- treasurer's report con
cludes with a showing of only $528 actual
expenses for 1896, as against $2328 spent
the year previous.
The election of officers resulted as fol
lows: J. C. Eubanks, president(re-eiecled);
W. F. Peterson, vice-presi<:ent; A. U.
Boldeman, secretary (re-elected); B. B.
Galland, treasurer; directorsâ H. Morgen
thau, A. Hamnel, H. L. Judeil, c. B.
Thompson, A. Weill, Nate Jacobs and the
officers lieretolore mentioned.
ft. H. Davis was the sire at the associa
tion's high jinks, held in tbe basement of
the Native bons* Hall after the hour when
all but commercial tourists bad retired to
bed last night.
The worthy sire was assisted in arrang
ing a programme by H. S. Morgentuau,
chairman of the entertainment commit
tee, and between them they managed lo
get every talented drummer in the audi
ence to participate. Some few profession
als, engaged for the occasion, appeared as
amateurs alongside tbe imprumpiu stars
that shot across the stage.
Freda, a beauty from Honolulu, de
lighted her audience lor a few moments
with the newest dances from the islands.
She was almost tame, as it were, compared
to "warm-belt" stories told by ihe boys.
These stories were entirely "entre nous,"
as Sire Davis said. He added, also, that
unwilling ears might as well go outside
and listen to the patter of the rain. Such
stories as were told after that were enough
to make the earth quake with laughter as
the sun goes down in deepening blushes.
The attendance included several hun
dred travelers and their friends, and be
ginning to-morrow, as this migratory
class starts out on the commercial high
way, there will be a new*epidemic of stories
sprung on the unsuspecting country cus
tomer.

WAS THE CASE FIXED ?
Judge Conlan Surprised by the .Expla
nation of a Prisoner.
John Williams, alias Vincent Bailey,
the painter, who was released on his own
recognizance on Jane 21 an*d disappeared,
and was arrested in Oakland Monday, was
convicted by Judge Conlan yesterday of
discharging firearms within the City
limits.
When be was questioned as to his rea
son for keeping out of the way, he aston
ished the Judge by remarking thnt he had
given a man named Maboney $25, with
the understanding that it was to be
divided between the Judge and in
attorney, in consideration of hav
ing the case dismissed. Mahoney had
told him that was the usual way in such
cases, and believing him, he had not
thought any more about the matter.
The Jndge ordered Williams to appear
for sentence to-day, and meantime an
effort will be made to ascertain if he is
telling the truth and who Mahoney
may be.

CONDEMNS THE
ONE-MAN POWER
Mr. Rainey Believes It to
Be a Menace to
Republics.
Re'orms Urged in Police Court
Prosecutions by the Civic
Federation.
Dairymen Intend to Eliminate the
Weakness cf Human Nature
F. om Cow Inspection.
The most important piece of work the
Civic Federation has on hand with re
gard to legislation is an amendment to
the law regulating the appointment of
the four prosecuting attorneys for the
Police Judges' courts. At present those
attorneys are appointed by the Supervis
ors and have no judicial head. They are
responsible to no person in particular, and
it has been the rule that the basis of their
appointment is political influence rather
than competency.
The federation is of the opinion that the
prosecuting attorneys should be appointed
by the District Attorney. Then they
would be responsible to him directly, and
he, bein,: a lawyer, would be more likely
to be a better judge of their qualifications
than the Supervisors, who are not sup
posed to know the law. The manner in
which cases are prosecuted has been for a
lone time a subject of much solicitude on
the part of the federation, which body be
lieves that justice would be more likely to
be served by the reform which it suggests.
It is understood that Samuel Rainey,
who holds the destinies of the municipal
Democracy in the hollow of his hand, is
not in favor of this reform; that Mr.
Rainey is of the opinion that it would
place too much power in the hands of the
District Attorney, and that one-man
power is a menace to republics. Other
people than Mr. Rainey, but equally pure
as politicians, are also opposed to invest
ing Mr. Barnes with the control of cases
in the Police Court. They say the defeat
of the proposed charter, which contained
this reform, was a sufficient indication of
the feeling of the people.
Dairymen will be very much in evidence
at the coming session of the Legislature.
Those of San Francisco in particular will
be heard in most emphatic language. The
recent scandals in connection with the in
spection of milk and of cows supposed to
be afflicted with tub rculosis have given
rise to many ugly stories, some of which
have been inspired by revenge and spite,
and some of which are believed to be true.
Dairymen believe that human nature
operates in the case of cow ana miik in
spectors all the world over, just as it does
in the case of pound-keeper.*, constables
and others, say in the benighted land of
Russia, and that the official who is paid a
salary to inspect reindeer, in Siberia is
often tempted sorely to condemn healthy
animals in order to make a showing for
his money.
They say that while the cow and milk
officials of the City of San Francisco and
State of California may be as spotless as
the snow that dazzles the eves of the cor
rupt Siberian official, they are yet human,
and that their discoveries of so mucli
tuberculosis in so short a period of time is
almost unprecedented in veterinary his
tory.
The dairymen have united their forces,
and will make a desperate struggle to ba
relieve^ of the ever-present menace of an
inspector with a hypodermic syrinee and
a bottle of tuberculosed bacilli, guaranteed
to produce galloping cow consumption
within twenty-four hours. They fear the
present system of milk supervision offers
too great a premium for blackmail, should
a venal man be appointed inspector.
Ranchers who drop into cheap restaurÂ«
ants on their visits to town cannot help
tasting the oleomargarine placed on the
tables without any warning whatever that
it is not what it is represented to be.
They cannot fiiid any notice anywhere, as
required by the law, that oleomargarine ia
used in that place instead of butter. The
sale of oleomargarine has made stealthy
inroads into the market value of butter,
and the dairymen intend to force the en
actment of such legislation as will put a
ttop to the sale of a spurious article under
false pretenses.
It had been given out that Rainey was
suffering from lumbago and intended eo
ing south. Nevertheless it is understood
that he will attend tbe meeting of tha
Fire Commissioners this morning at 11
o'clock.
Bishop Newman Will Preside.
Bishop Newman will conduct services at
the Central M. E. Church, Mission street, be
tween Sixth and Seventh, this evening at 7:30
o'clock, the service being the initial one of. a
series to continue there the week of prayer.
Watch-night services will also be held at
tWs church Thursday evening, commencing ac
8:30 o'clock, the evangelists Sbepard and
Marshall assisting the pastor.
Meetings will be held daily next week at 2
p. m. at the same church under tne direction
ot Bishop Newman, the Methodist churches of
the City uniting in them.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. "^
Larkin street was lovely.
We have illuminations almost every
night.
It threatens to be a Legislature of ten
thousand bills.
It is a pity Santa Claus did not think to
give Bryan a new hobby.
There has never been such a lum
holiday season since the town began.
Wherever the streets are lighted the
people are d .lighted, and the movement
goes on.
Street improvement progresses as rap
idly as if almost every highway were a
racetrack.
It does not show up much like a holiday
week, but perhaps Friday will redeem it
as a starter for the New Ye.ar.
There is work enough in the report of
the Code Commission alone to keep the
lawyers of the Legislature busy for sixty
days.
It looks as if the Sultan were counting
on the Kaiser, and there may be trouble
ahead for Europe around the sick nfan's
bedside.
There may have been disappointments
Ecmewhere, but for the San Joaquin it
lias been a year o'. the biggest kind of re
alization.
Chicago has discovered that while en
terprise is good as a general thing, it is al
ways well to have conservatism in the
banking business.
In complaining at European courts of
the threat of American interference in the
Cuban war, Spain has found much sym
pathy but no help.
The Southern Pacific swore in court
that its rates in the San Joaquin could not
be reduced, but nevertheless, and notwith
standing, they have been.
Even the most progressive teachers at
the State convention will find that the
people of San Jose need no higher educa
tion in the art of hospitality.
If there is any truth in the report that
Premier Canovas of Spain said he was
greatly pleased with President Cleveland's
attitude he must be very fond of a fat
thing.
It is now believed that Olney raised the
point of tne President's exclusive right to
deal with foreign affairs simply to set Con
gress to talking about the constitution in
stead of Cuba.
The winds and the waves as well as hu
man testimony are working for Sarf Pedro,
and if the Government commission de
clares for Santa Monica it will have to de
clare against nature.
It seems the administration has decided
to take steps preparatory to foreclosing
the government mortgage on the default
ing Pacific roads. The funding bill is
evidently no sure thing.
If Bryan bad as much sense as Senator
Hill he would be silent; if he had as
much composure as Cleveland he would
co fishing; but being what he is there is
no hope for him unless he gets the lock
jaw.
The Scots have begun raising money
for a Barns monument by a poetic appeal,
and before long they will get to the stage
where they will bring in the cakes and
tbe barleycorn, and then the thing will be
done.
Bryan's exultation at the Lincoln ban
quet over the fact that prosperity has not
yet returned to the country shows him to
be an unmitigated calamity howler. The
Nebraska people ought to suppress him as
a public nuisance.
The gold Democrats have at last found
a straw that seems to be blowing their
way and are now calling the attention of
the country to tbe fact that Palmer re
ceived more votes in New York than
Bryan did in Vermont.
A Colorado desperado, who owns np
to killing three men, burst into
tears when sentenced to death,
thus showing there are gentle feel
ings in the human breasj, which being
rightly touched will make even the tough
est weep.
After an interview with thÂ« President
elect Senator Wolcott says there will be
an international conference on the subject
of bimetallism within a short time after
Major McKiniey is inaugurated. Thus we
have another assurance of better prospects
for silver not far in the future.
In an interview with the Baltimore Sun
General Bradley T. Johnson, a strong
sympathizer with Cuba, pays there is no
need of Americans enlisting to help the
Cubans, as the patriots have already more
men than they can arm. The proper
caper for the Jingo, therefore, is to stay
at home and send his rifle.
A considerable number o' Japanese bare
found their way into service in New York
households, and according to the New
York Post "sanguine people see in this fil
tering immigration a way out of the com
plexities of tbe servant problem." From
which it is easy to foresee that sanguine
New York is going to have a disappoint
ment.
M'KINLEY AND BRYAN.
It was a fortunate coincidence that cave
to the public a report of Senator Wolcott's
interview with Major McKiniey on the
same day with the report of Mr. Bryan's
speech at the banquet of the Lincoln
Traveling Men's Bryan Club. Both were
published yesterday, and the contrast be
tween them shows very clearly the differ
ence between the two men in their atti
tudes toward the desired return to bimetal
lism.
Senator Wolcott went to Canton as
chairman of the committee of five ap
pointed by Republican Senators to draft a
bill providing for international bimetal
lism, to confer with the President-elect on
the subject. He found Major McKiniey
in thorough accord with the objects of the
bill, and has declared unhesitatingly that
there will be an international conference
on the subject of the free coinage of silver
within a short time after the new Presi
dent is inaugurated.
While tl.e President-elect was thus con
ferring with a representative of the Re
publicans in Congress, to devise the best
means for bringing about the free coinage
of silver by international agreement, Mr.
Bryan was preparing the address which
he was to make at the banquet to be given
in his honor. In that address he uttered
nothing which gives any evidence that he
has ever thought out a plan to be pursued
in order to attain success. Hia speech
was from beginning to end the speech of
an agitator who is rapidly becoming a
mere calamity howler. '.There was noth
ing in it to encourage his followers, or to
give hope to any of the friends of silver of
the accomplishment of anything for the
cause of bimetallism under his leadership.
lt is well known there is a strong senti
ment in favor of the free coinage of sil
ver in all European countries, and that in
some of the most important of them this
sentiment is the dominant one, not only
among the peopje, but among statesmen
and financiers. This fact assures a strong
support in those countries to any move
ment which may be made by our Govern
ment to bring it about. Major McKiniey
and the Republican leaders in the Senate
are therefore acting in the most expedient
as well as the most statesmanlike man
ner in seeking to establish bimetallism by
international agreement instead of at
tempting any rash experiment by this
country in the direction of silver mono
metallism.
Witt this contrast before them the peo
ple can see that in tbe monetary issue
they have the choice of supporting the
statesman who has been elected to the
Presidency or the agitator who has been
defeated. If all the earnest advocates of
bimetallism will now give their support to
the incoming administration we can re ti-
sonably expect that some measures of
great importance may be agreed upon by
the nations for the laruer use of silver as
a money metal. If, however, any consid
able number of the friends of silver adopt
the foolish tactics of Bryan the efforts of
our Government may ba largely hindered
horn accomplishing tiie results desired.
It is impossible to silence Bryan, but
popular sentiment can soon show him that
his verbosity on this issue is expended in
vain. Thousands of those who voted for
him will Bustain the policy of Major Me-
Kinley, and by so doing will secure a
speedy settlement of the monetary issue
and a safe return to the free coinage of
silver and a genuine bimetallic system of
money.
THE CODE REPORT
The report of the commission charged
with the work of revising the code covers
so wide a variety of subjects, proposes so
many Important amendments and recom
mends such numerous alterations in our
laws as to raise it to the first rank among
measures to be considered by the Legisla
ture this winter. It is sufficient in itself
to occupy the attention of the lawyers in
both houses for the whole session. It
must have in every section the most care
ful consideration, for it affects to a great
extent the welfare of every citizen.
There is scarcely an important feature
of our law which is not more or less
changed in some way by the alterations
recommended. Among the more impor
tant subjects on which laws now existing
are proposed to be amended are the State
Printing Office, the Bank Commission,
Insurance and Investments, Building
and Loan Associations, the State Nor
mal School, Elections, Schools, Roads,
Labor, Taxation, Liquor Licenses and
National Guard. In each of these the
changes proposed are many, and in several
instances are of the most serious import.
The subject is too vast and complicated,
to be dealt with as a whole. It will have
to be taken up in detail and every pro
posed amendment or addition carefully
scrutinized and studied by the best legal
minds in the State. It goes without say
ing the legislators will receive abundant
advice and assistance on the subject from
all parts of the commonwealth and from
all classes of people. This advice, how
ever, will have to be as carefully digested
as the report itself, for while, as Solomon
said, "in a multitude of counsel there is
wisdom," the wisdom can be obtained in
most cases only by carefully winnowing
it out like a grain of wheat from a bushel
of chaff.
That there has long been needed a thor
ough revision of our laws is beyond doubt.
The Code Commission was appointed in
response to a public demand, tor tie per
formance of the work. The report there
fore will have public sentiment in its
favor at the outset. This fact encourages
the hope that the revision will be in the
main acceptable to the State. It will have
to undergo much criticism, for no work
was ever yet done that satisfied every
body. The desire for revision, however,
should not lead the Legis ature to be too
hasty in accepting the propdsed amend
ments. The wore has cost considerable
money and much time, and now that it
has come np for final solution it ought to
be settled tor years to come by being settled
right, according to tbe existing conditions
of the State.
RAILROAD BUILDING
Although the construction of the San
Joaquin Valley Railroad from Stockton to
Fresno has made the railroad building of
the year notable in California, it has been
everywhere else of less extent than has
been known in this conntry for many
years past It is pleasing to note there
fore that the new year promises better
things, both for ourselves and for other
States in the Union.
Thb Call yesterday contained news
items reported progress now being made
toward the construction of no less than
three important railway lines which will
affect California. All of these may not
be begun daring the year, but the outlook
for them is certainly" promising and gives
a reasonable hope of their ultimata ac
complishment.
The first notice was contained in a dis
patch from Sioux City, lowa, stating that
Donald McLean, the original organizer of
the Pacific Snort Line, had arrived hi that
city to arrange for a survey of the road
from O'Neill, Nebr., to Saa Francisco.
Mr. McLean, it is stated, claims to be
backed by $32,000,000 of English capital,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1896.
and is reported as saying that the road
will be rushed through.
Tbe second item came in a dispatch
from Monterey to the effect that word had
been received there from New York that
the bond* of the Monterey and Fresno
Company had been placed with an East
eru syndicate. According to the report,
the projected line has been changed so
that the road will run to San Jose instead
of Monterey. It was also stated that the
work of construction is expected to begin
early in March, or just as soon as the
route can be located from San Juan.
Ths third dispatch was from San Diego,
and announced the reception by Philip
Morse, president of the Chamber of Com
merce, of a letter from E. C. Potter of
Chicago, who, after writing of tbe pro
posed organization of a steamship line be
tween San Diego and the Orient, went on
to say a movement has been set on foot
by capitalists in Chicago and New York
to construct a transcontinental ra lway in
the East with a terminus at San Diego.
When to these three lines, which seem
to be fairly well assured, there is added
the certainty of the construction of the
San Joaquin Valley road, southward to
Bakerstieid and later on to this City, it
wiil be seen that the outlook for railway
building for California during the coming
year is decidedly good. It must be borne
in mind, moreover, that these reports re
fer only to great undertakings. There are
many smaller roads that are almost cer
tain to be constructed during the year.
Among these is one small in length, but
great in cost; which' will also be great in
results. This is the roadway which will
complete the gap in the coast line of tbe
Southern Pacific.
With such prospects before us of im
provement in our transportation system,
even the least sanguine will begin to feel
hopeful of the coming year. The con
struction of railways affects every indus
try in the State, and with the brightening
outlook for railway work there comes
therefore a new glow on the horizon of
every city and every county in California.
THE TURKISH CRISIS.
European dispatches show that a new
complication has arisen in the problem of
dealing with the Ottoman empire. When
it was made known a short time ago that
the great powers had virtually agreed
upon a line of action, it was believed that
in a- comparatively short time the pro
posed plan of reform would be undertaken,
and moreover that it would be carried
forward with a vigor that would soon put
reform into operation throughout all the
dominions of the Sultan. This expecta
tion, however, has been disappointed. In
the face of the allied powers the Sultan
remains obdurate.
In conversation with M. de Nelidoff, the
Russian Embassador, who seems to have
acted with the concurrence of all the
allied powers, the Sultan positively re
fused to consent to any foreign control,
financial or otherwise. When in diplo
matic language he was informed that the
continuance of his empire might depend
upon his consent to the terms, he is re
ported to have said: "i may be the last
of the Caliphs, but I will never become a
second Khedive."
The firmness of the Sultan in refusing to
agree to the reforms submitted to him by
the alliance has raised the suspicion that
he is backed by the Emperor of Germany.
For this suspicion there seeras no ground
other than the well-known fact that the
Emperor has been friendly to the Suitan
and has held aloof from tne other powers
of Europe ever since the present crisis in
Turkish affairs be?an. It does not seem
likely, however, that Germany would
willingly intorvene alone to save the Otto
man empire in its corruption and de
cadence against such a powerful combina
tion as that of England;, France and
Russia. If, therefore, Germany is sup
porting the Sultan, it is altogether prob
able that her statesmen know tbey can
count on the assistance of Austria and
Italy if the complication should end in
WBr.
The intervention of Germany in the
matter would be a new departure In her
diplomacy. When Bismarck was at the
head of the German empire and had
charge of its foreign relations he once said
in a public speech, "1 would not sacrifice
the life of a single one of my big Pomer
anians to save the Turkish empire."
Germany has in fact nothing to gain from
any settlement of the problem. Her
borders are too remote from Turkey for
her to receive any valuable portion of the
spoils if the empire were divided, nor has
she any particular commerce or interest
in that section of Europe and Asia Minor
to conserve by maintaining it.
Until some full assurance has been re
ceived that the Emperor of Germany has
actively intervened the more reasonable
theory to account for the Sultan's action
will be that of pride and obstinacy. The
allusion to the Khedive is significant. The
Sultan has seen whit has happened in
Egypt since the ruler of that country sub
mitted himself to the control of the great
powers. He prefers war rather than a tame
submission to such a fate, and taking all
things into consideration he can hardly
be blamed for the choice.
HER WISH.
Three maids together sat one eve
And chatted, in the g oamlng,
Of what they'd wish for, most of all,
Through a. I their fancy roaming.
The first one said, and heaved a sigh,
"Could I have one wi*h granted,
I'd lodk for wealth: I am so poor,
'Tls what I've always wanted"
" But I have wealth," the second said,
" And still I'm sad and lonely:
And so I long for lover true.
Who'd love me for love only."
"And 1 have wealth and lover both,
Vet I don't iJilnk It wrong or
Wicked," the third one said. "But onV
I long for something to 'ong for?"

NOT HARD TO SAY IT.
Pittsbarg Dispatch.
Apropos of Mr. Choate and the New York
senatorship some one told me a story the other
dayâ l think it was Mr. Barry, the affable and
agreeable correspondent of the New York Sun
â which 1b so good that It is possible it has
been told before, but a good story is never
spoiled by the retelling. It seems that Mr.
Choate and Mr. Reed, T. 8., the CÂ«ar, were
with Mr. Wolcott in his library one evening.
They had dined together, and over their cigars
were discussing with wisdom, that in the
journalistic protesslon would bring $50 a col
umn, the affairs of the day.
"You will hardly believe it," said Mr. Choate
when the decanter was passed to him," but I
never have taken a drink ol whisky, never
pluyed a game of poker, and never bet on a
horserace in my life."
"I wish I could say that," sighed Wolcott.
"Why can't you?" drawled Eeed. "Choate
did."
NO ROCK.BOUND COAST.

and the much-abused Pilgrims hove ; to off the

"the breaking waveÂ« dashed high," the "stern

'â  absence, for a mor^ sandy stretch of shore

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
A. M. McDonald of Sonora, one of tbe own
ers of the noted Belleview mine, eight miles
northeast of that brisk mountain town, has
been at the Lick for the past lew days.
He says the activity in mining Is marked all
over Tuolumne County, and that the best
evidence of it is that, during the past year
there has not at any time been a single idle
mill except in a few Instances for a brief time,
and owing solely to lack of water.
Mr. McDonald is employing twenty men,
and is milling a large amount of ore each
month.
"We have a 10-stamp mill," said Mr. Mc-
Donald, "and have cleared $36,000 over all
expenses during the past year, besides doing
considerable development work. Our mine is
in the eastern mining belt of Californiaâ the
same as the Zeile and other mines in Calaveras
County about West Point.
"A large amount of money has been taken
out of Tuolumne County during the year that
A. M. MoDONALD, One of the Owners of the Belleview Mine, Near Sonora.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
is just closing. I have lately seen a printed
announcement that the product of the county
would approximate $600,000 or $700,000, but
I am convinced it is a great deal more than
this. There are single mines in Tuolumne
that have produced almost that much.
"The Rawhide might be referred to; then
there is the Jumper, which is another heavy
producer. The Dutch is another large prop
erty. Besides there is the Golden Gate, the
Dead Horse and tbe Eureka, all of which have
produced considerable. I would be sur
prised if the product of the county did not
reach $2,000,000.
"A great many pocket mines have also been
worked for the past year, are nowâ and will be
right alongâ and these are getting out lots of
gold. When you add it all up it is a big
amount. 1 think Tuolumne is one of the rich
est counties, to say the least, in the whole
State for mining.
'â¢The county is also active all over. It is not
so In on* ptace, but everywhere. Times are
good, too. We have had steady prosperity for

A BOX PLEATED SKIRT.
The new skirts are cut with two gores in the
back, which form box-pleats. The one shown
here has in all seven gores, the two side gores
flowing wide at tbe loot, and close-fitted over
the hips. The great advantage gained by two
side gores is the permanent good shape, for
these gores do not stretchout of shape, as a
wider and necessarily : more bias gore would.
All fabrics are cut in this way, and the side
gores are usually cut straight at the front
edge; but if striped goods is used they may be
cut straight through the center, thus lining
the edges both bias and making the stripes
meet at the seams. The back gores are cut
with tbe straight thread through the center
in any case.
Black satin is still as much used as any
other fabric for skirts to be worn with fancy
blouse waists or coat basques for full dress oc
casions. The latest thing is the lining of
white silk, finished with a plain binding of
velveteen or braid, the balayuese ruffle being
quite out of date. The only stfffening now
used is a band of haircloth about six inches
wide at the loot, and even this is omitted in
many skirts, the flare depending on the proper
cut and on the body of the slllc used for
lining.
Dresden silks are much used for separate
skirts and recommend themselves because two
or three different colors will generally har
monize with them, and so a grear â¢Â«cÂ« cl > "Â»
waist is possible. One of brown with black
satin threads, the flowers being Indefarnte
tones of violet, had a brown velvet coat
basque, a black satin waist and a waist ot
violet chiffon trimmed with sable for evening
wear. : ____â .
STAND BY JUDGE WAYMIRE.
Oakland Tribune.
When the campaign closed and victory
crowned the Republican party with success,
Alameda was thrilled with pride to know that
she was the banner Republican county in the
State of California, and that pride was justly
augmented when the suggestion came
from Canton that a Cabinet position was pos
sible to California, and probable to Ala
meda County in the person oi our esteemed
iellow-cittzen. the Hon. James A. Waymlre.
We at least felt secure that if any assist
ance was required to make assurance
doubly sure, that assistance would be
forthcoming from the United States Sen
ator, who is also from Alameda County,
and the Congressman who, likewise, hails from
this county. The general chagrin in the com
munity can hardly be described when a dis
patch from Washington announced that the
Republicans from California had cau
cused in Washington, and to the sur
prise of nearly everybody in Alameda
County had named the Hon. Horace Davis oi
San Francisco, in place of Alameda's favorite
son. The inquiry naturally was provoked.
How could it be possible for Waymire's
strength to have vanished when in the hands
ot two powerful men such as our
United States Senator and Congressman?
Up to date no reasonable or satisfactory
answer has been received by Judge
Waymire's friends or the friends of
the gentlemen above referred to ex
plaining the unexpected result of that cau
cused meeting. Everybody in Alameda County,
as well as throughout ;the entire State, is cog
nizant of the fact that Judge Waymlre was
one of the pioneers in the McKiniey cam
paign, and did as much if not more than any
single individual iv the State of California
to bring about the Republican success ob
tained, which, of course, directly operated
to make it possible for the election of a
Republican United States Senator, and
the hope and wish, aside from the grati
tude that was rightfully and honor
ably expected, was that Judge Waymire
should have been sustained as one of Presi
dent McKiniey's advisers, and that no effort
should have been spared to have brought suc
cess to this end. The fiasco is deplorable and
Aiameda's chagrin is pre-eminent. The re
sponsibility should find lodgrment somewhere,
and the people of Alameda County are en
titled to know to whom is due the censure for
this wrong.
The slight put upon Judge Waymire seems
to have been studied and gratuitous, as it is
well known that no caucus, for the purpose of
selecting a member of Major McKiniey's
Cabinet was necessary. On the contrary,
it seemed a little premature, if not imper
tinent, for this delegation to select for
Major McKiniey a member of his personal
Cabinet without having been asked to do so,
and, independent of this suggestion,
to have named a man, however
honorable, who in no way contributed
to the success that made it possi
ble for Major McKiniey to require a Cabinet.
By contrast the Hon. James A. Waymire, at the
request oi Republicans of his district,
who feared that by reason of certain con
ditions his Assembly district ' would be
lost to the Republican party unless he (Way
mire) consented to accept tne nomination and
make the canvass (which he did), and won by
a handsome majority, showed the great
strength of bis personality at home and the
confidence justly reposed in him.
AN INCILENT IN HISTORY.
Lewiston Journal.
"There is some doubt as to what part the
Nineteenth Maine played in the war, though
most of the boys think tt put down tne rebel
lion," said Major Parsons the other day. ''The
fact is the Nineteenth ate up the Southern Con
federacy. They stole pigs, robbed hen-roosts,
cleaned out orchards and cellars and foraged
the country so thoroughly that the rebellion
had nothing left to feed ou and so lay down
and died."
Then Al Wells of the same regiment took up
the thread of the story :

The. memorial to Congress prepared by
John F. Doyle was completed yesterday
afternoon, too late to be submitted to the
meeting. It bears this title: "Tne Cen
tral Pacific Railroad; Debtâ California's
Remonstrance against Refunding It," and
consists of a pamphlet ot twenty-nine
pages, comprising about 20,000 words.
After referring to the more than gener
ous policy of the Government in the mat
ter of subsidy bonds and land grants to
the Central Pacific Railroad Company the
memorial jays:
The indulgence and extension of time here
involved are asked under falie pretenses, the
diMngenuousness of which should forbid en
tertaining the proposal. The demand for time
to pay is based on the suggestion of poverty
on the part of the debtor, whose earning
power it is said cannot reach beyond the pit
tance proposed to oe required by the pending
bill, but the pretense of poverty is entirely
false. The Central Pacific Railroad Company
is paying dividends to its shareholders to-day,
with promise to double them as soon as the
bill passes, and it has very large means, money
claims, which should be called in and applied
to the payment of its debts. Some of these
are as fullows:
Claims against its former directors and man
agers amounting to many millions for misap
propriation of its funds and property by means
of fraudulent contracts and dealings with
themselves through the disguise ot construc
tion companies: the Contract and Finance
Company, the Western Development Com
pany, etc.
Claims of great magnitude against the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company, its successful
rival in business.
Claims against its directors for fraudnlent
mismanagement whereby its revenues have
been impaired for their own benefit.
It is shown how, by the "acquiescent
co-operation" of Mr. Searles, who married
Mr?. Hopkins and inherited hen Southern
Pacific Company stock. C. P. Huntiugton
secured control of the corporation, and
continues:
Being a Kentucky corporation, the Southern
Pacific Company organization is not governed
by the laws of this State, wherein its business
lies, and the proportional representation of
stockholders in tbe direction allowed by Cali
fornia law has no place. Tne other panes in
interest are therefore indebted to the consid
eration of Mr. Huntington for tneir positions
in the board, and must dance to such music
as be sees fit to piay. He is the president of
the company and is no King Log. He con
trols everything, and is to all intents and pur
poses the company.
Returning from this necessary introduction
of the characters we come to the gigantic
fraua on the Central Pacific Company, perpe
trated by its managers in 1880. It consisted
essentially in using the credit and means of
that company to build for their own bent-fit
ihe Southern Pacific road as a rival line, de
signed and calculated to destroy the value of
the Central !
How this was done is related in detail.
It is stated that Southern Pacific Railroad
bonds to the amonnt of $32,000,000 were
sold at an average prica ot 95 per cent of
their face on tbe credit of the Central Pa
cific and that $10,000,000 worth of land
was granted to the company by Govern
ment. "AH these large sums," says the
memorial, "should be accounted to tbe
Central P. icific Company as tbe fruits of
the fraud." It continues as follows:
Thus the dishonest directors of the Central
Pacific road procured the means for construct
ing the Southern Pacific, which by its shorter
mileage between the oceans, its easier grades,
and the preference given it in the routing of
freight has been almost the ruin of the Cen
tral Pacific. To ensure tho disastrous result,
however, the managers determined to cut off
its local freights also, and to this end con
structed (in the names of companies ultimately
consolidated with toe Southern Pac.fie) a sub
stantially parallel road through tiie San
Joaquin Valley on each side of the Central,
ready to intercept every pound of freight ap
proaching it on either side 1
Other important excerpta from the
memorial follow:
To pay a dividend of 1 per cent on thÂ« stock
of the Central Pacific Company requires $672,
-000, an amount too large to be overlooked by
a slip in bookkeeping 'or to be easily concealed
under some general head. And the question
whence comes the money wherewitn they are
paid is not without importance.
Denied authoritative inlormation as to the
motives for or the source of this extraor
dinary dividend, which was paid to the stock
holders witnout being earned oy the company,
d-clared by the board of directors or show on
the books of account, we are driven to conjec
ture; and the suggestion arises that they may
be paid by one or more of the guilty directors
or other persons interested in placating
the dissatisfied stockholders and pars
ing the refunding bill. This conjecture
is not without probability, and if
accapted, public opinion will not be
apt to hesitate long as to the name of the dis
tributor of such lavish largess or In conjec
turing its motive. A settlement made with
the United States, embodied in an act of con
gress, which at the same time condones so
many and such monstrous frauds, insures hii
Southern Pacific Railroad for eighty-eight
years against the competition of the Central
Pacific road, and gives to his dishonest ninety
nine years' lease the sanction of the law of
the land, may well be worth double or treble
the sum required to pay these dividendsâ say
$4,032,000.
In any case for CongresH, in face of the reve
lations here mude, to pass a refunding act
based, as all such propositions are, on the
supposed inability oi the company to pay its
dent, without a previous clear explanation
and understanding ot this transaction,
whether it represents dividends or hush
money, would be to put Itself In the position
of appearing as either ihe dupe of designing
men or their instrument in deceiving others.
This Central Pacific Company under its past
and present management has come to be the
most odious and detested corporation that has
probably ever been known, and this "for rea
sons, capital, confess, d and proved." It has
invented and put in force more and more dif
ferent modes of vexations in transportation
than probably any other in the world, and we
have always been the sufferers.
By their omnibus leaso and ihe lease of the
Central Pacific road, they have united practi
cally nil the roads in the State under the man
agement of a foreign corporation, which in
turn is under the control of a single individ
ual, whose greed has no limit and who avows
that he has no other or higher standard of
right than his own opinion. He has never
made public his general code of morals, if he
has any, but in letters to his former associate
he exhibits his ideas on procuring Congres
sional legislation to be. in briei, to bribe those
who will accept and vilify those who will not.
By this combination they for years simul
taneously withheld payment of railroad taxes,

gear. Public schools were closed, Supervisors,
legislators and executive officers bribed, in
junctions defied, and all this under the pre
tense of ascertaining the constitutionality of
an enactment procured by themselves and
passed for their benefit
Goaded by provocations such as those here
adverted toâ and tney are but specimen cases
to which similar ones are of constant occur
renceâthe people of California have long
looked forward to the expiration of the charter
of the Central Pacific road for delivery Irom
this body of iniquity, at least for their chil
dren, aud on their behalf we respectfully and
earnestly entreat Congress not to pass any act
which will continue down to the coming gen
eration any Dart of the off .'nse, outrage and
oppression which we have endured from this
iniquitous combination now called tne
Southern Pacific Company. Deprived of the
management and power to continue to plun
der the Central I'acific road, it can hardly fail
to go to j.ieces and relax its grasp on the vitals
of our State.
It may almost be said that all the known
operations of the Pacific Railroad manage
ment in this State are saturated with fraud
anu dishonesty which recur at every turn of
their proceedings.
Enough has been said to show the need of a
thorough investigation by the Government of
the relations of the Central Pacific Company
to the parties who have so long hela it in their
grasp, and the enforcement of its just claims
against them. This done, it wil be found that
50 far from being insolvent, the company can
easily be recognized asagreat trunk line to the
Pacific Coast, competing fairly with all others,
.and on the basis of solvency and honest man
agement, manifestly to the advantage of the
Government as a creditor und of its own stock
holders. In any event, the proi erty, if it has
to be sold, can be then offered with knowledge
of what it consists and what i's earning ca
pacity isâ things at present absolutely un
known to any one but the Southern Pacinc
combination, who have for so many years past
managed its affair? to its own destruction.
It must not be forgotten to extend the pay
ment or refund this debt ns proposed is prac
tically to sell the road to its present manage
ment on a credit of a hundred years, taking
their promise to pay in small installments.
Congress does not, nor does any of its mem
bers, or any executive officer of the United
States, or, indeed, anybody, know what prop
erty you are selling. Ko inventory of it
exists, and this ignorance shuts oft' all com
petitive bidding.
We believe that all the dpsired ends can be
obtained by means of a foreclosure of the
Government lieu on the romi. For this pur
{use, as the property lies in several different
States, complete jurisdiction should be con
ferred on some one of the courts of the United
Siaies, and the ordinary powers of the court
en larged so as to enable it to ascertain and re
dress, in the foreclosure suit, al! frmids prac
ticed on the company or its shareholders by
the management or by their tools or confed
erates, and the application of any moneys re
covered from such parties to the sinking fund
in the United States treasury. We therefore
respectfully pray Congress to instruct i is ap
propriate committees to prepare and report a
bill to that effect.
LOS ANGELES' PARK.
Exact Copy of the Generous Offer of G.
J. Griffith
The following is an exact ( opy of the
original offer made by the generous donor,
G. J. Griffith, of a tract for tbe Los An
geles Park:
To the Mayor and City Council of Los Angeles
â Yoi'R Honor and Gentlemen : in the course
of twenty-three years of active business life in
California I have become proudly attached to
our beautiful city of Los Angles, wnich, through
its great natural advantages and its matchless
climate, averaging3oo sunny days in the year,
is destined to soon become a great metropolis.
The arduous wort of these years has been re
warded with fair success, and recognizing the
duty which one who has acquired some little
wealth owes to the community iv which he
has prospered, and desiring to aid the advance
ment and happiness of the city that has been
for so long aud always will be my home, I am
impelled to make an offer, the acceptance of
which by yourselves, acting for the people, I
believe will be a source of enjoyment and
pride to my fellows and add a charm to our
beloved city. Realizing that public narks are
the most desirable feature of all cities which
have them, and that they lend an attractive
ness and beauty that no other adjunct can,
I hereby propose to present to the city of i<os
Angeles, as a Christmas gift, a public park of
about 3000 acres of land in one body, situated
a fraction over a mile north of the northern
city line, including fully two and a half miles
of the frostless foothills bordering on the
C'ahuenga Valley, five miles of the Los Ange
les river bottom, the lands generally known
as the Ostrich Farm, and the beautiful little
valley which was called the Press Colony site.
Also with these lands the improvements
thereon, consisting of several buildings and a
water plant with tunnels and piping, |the
original cont of these having been over
$10,000, and all of which will be of service
and benefit in improving the park. This park
will include over 2000 acres of tillable land
and some of the most romantic scenery of any
park in the world. Not only will it be the
largest city park in the world, but its diver
sity of picturesque vailey, hill, river and
mountain, with its many varieties of trees
aud its rich undergrowth, render it suscept
ible of being cultivated into the most beau
tiful of parks.
I will deed this land to the city as soon as
the City Engineer has established the lines
satisfactorily, but in making this donation I
would like to impose the condition, if after
consideration it should appear that it may be
legally done, that no railroad to this park be
cnartered with the right to charge a larger
fare than 5 cents. I wish to impose this con
dition to insure this lare, so that the park will
be in every sense the people's recreation
grounds and transportation to it kept within
the reach of the most modest means.
I wish to mate this gift white I am in the
full vigor of life that I may enjoy with my
neighbors its beauties aud pleasures and that
I may bear with me, when 1 cross the clouded
river, the pleasing knowledge of the fruition
of a wish long dear to me. I trust that you
will accept this gift for the people of Los Ange
les in the same spirit in which it in offeree.
Respectfully yours, Q. J. Griffith.
Los Angelea, Cal., December 15, 181)0.
CARL NILSSON'S PATENT.
Judge McKenna Will Deride the Aerial
. Ballet Case To- Day.
Judge McKenna of the United States
Circuit Court spent many hours yeaserday
listening to the arguments in the aerial
ballet case. Carl E. Nilsson brought an
action for damages and a permanent In
junction against the Al Hay roan Com
pany and the Palmer Cox Brownie Com
pany for usdnc in their aerial ballet a de
vice and machinery that he had patented.
His attorney made a long argument on
Monday why a permanent injunction
should be grunted and damages awarded.
The defendants' attorneys had their
day and set up the claim that Nilsson
slioula have taken other proceedings ana
not attempted to stop the show by in
junction. He should have sued for dam
ages of an adequate amount. Nilsson's
attorney replied to this by saying that his
client has not granted a license to any one
to use his invention, and so the damages
could not be estimated on that basis. He
would not concede that the defendants
have any right to use the invention, as
Nilsson wants the exclusive monopoly of
hia patent. Judge McKenna will give a
decision this forenoon.
COUPONS MUST BE PAID
..Outcome of litigation Concerning the
Dupont Street Bonds.
The Supreme Court has decided that a
a writ of mandate shall issue to compel
City and County Treasurer Widber to pay
certain coupons on Dupont-street bonds
to Livingston et al., who were the plain
tiffs in the Superior Court. The lower
court ordered that a writ should issue, but
an appeal was taken by Widber on .the
ground that the moneys in bis bands be
longing to the Dupont-street fund had
been paid under protest, and that the par
ties paying them had instituted An action,
then pending in the Supreme Court, for
the recovery of the moneys. He claimed
to be entitled to- hold over, pending an
issue in that matter.
Since the appeal was taken the case of
Davis against Widber, which is the ono
referred to in Widber's answer, has been
decided by the Supreme Court. This ac
tion, the Supreme Court decided yester
day, has made the defense sat up by Wid
ber unavailing. Hence the order of the
Superior Court was confirmed.

A Lonely Place for a Pretty Teacher

The Board of Education at its meeting
last Monday evening authorized the estab

the Farallon Breakers.
lone Islands for the children of the Gov
ernment officials whose business it is to
watch the lamp in the lighthouse and at
tend the fog signal.
Heretofore the children- have received
Buch instruction as was given them by
their parents, the United States Govern
ment not making any provision for the
establishment of public schools within
State boundaries, and as a consequence
the San Francisco Board of Education had
to send such school supplies as the fami
lies on the island needed.
There are three families on the island
and ten children of school age. This en
titles the islanders to a school, and as the
time had come when the school had to go
to the children or the children come to
the mainland for a school the Board of
Education provided one for the lonely
rock in the Pacific.
The next question that puzzled the
members of the board was to find a teacher
who would be willing to live out on tbe
wind-swept rock, and . finally they chose
one of the handsomest young lady gradu
ates from the Normal School and ordered
her off into exile.
Miss Daisy Annetta Doud, the exile, has
not seen her twentieth birthday yet. She
is a native of San Francisco and an only
child. She is a niece of Mrs. Nettie Wood,
principal of the Hearst Grammar School.
When asked by a Call representative
yesterday how she thought she would like
her new home she laughed heartily and
said :
"On, I think it will be just splendid
away out there, far from the City, with
nothing to trouble me. You know I can
get back every summer."
Miss Doud will go to the island just as
soon as she can find an outbound boat
that will touch there, and then she will
establish her little school and teach to the
music of the breakers that forever waste
their fury on the lonely pinnacle rising
from the ocean.
CHINESE FEMALES.
An Alarmingly Large Number of Tliis
Class Have Arrived
Recently.
There is something very significant in
the recent importation in large numbers
of Chinese women to this port. On the
10th inst. the steamer China arrived with
thirteen young painted females on board.
On tbe City of Pueblo, that arrived Mon
day, twenty-one more arrived, making
thirty-four within about two weeks. Dur
ing the preceding two months only seven
arrived. As a fact, it was well known In
certain circles that this influx of Chinese
women might be expected. Of course the
laws of the land prohibit unrestricted
Chinese immigration, but all these unde
sirable females claim the right to land on
the ground that they are the wives of
merchants in this City or that they are
native daughters.
As stated, it was well known that these
women were coming, and it was also well
known that they are not of the class that
they would pretend, upon arriving, to be.
There ts nc disputing the fact that they
are slaves of the most abject order and
nearly all being between 18 aud 22 years
of age their commercial value is from
$1000 to $1500 each, or over $35,000 for the
lot.
There is a grave suspicion that these
women have been brought to the United
States in the hope that they could be
landed by some hocus-pocus before the
Collector of the Port should select a new
interpreter of the Chineses language.
Shortly after the dismissal of Dick Wil
liams lor crookedness in Chinese mat
ters Collector Wise waa directed to
select an interpreter pot a Chinese. A
number of candidates have applied for
the position, but for some reason no one
has been appointed, so far as can be
learned. Why it is thus is not known.
From all appearances Dr. John Endlcntt
Gardner is very lavorably discussed for
the place and ins standing is above re
proach or question. Collector Wise is said
to object to Gardner because away back
several generations an ancestor of the
doctor married into one of the first fami
lies of the nobility of China.
White this sort of delay exists the
Chinese are doing tbair best to get s few
valuable females into the country. What
disposition will be made of those who are
now trying to land is a matter of con
jecture.
AFTERNOON WEDDING.
Nuptials of Miss Rose Fechlielmer and
Alfred Lillenfeld.
An interesting though extremely quist
wedding was that of Miss Rose Fech
heimer, daughter of Charles Fechheimer,
the pioneer merchant, and Alfred Lillen
thai, a popular young business man of
this City, celebrated yesterday afternoon
at the residence of the bride, 1631 Broad
way.
Owing to the recent death of the bride's
mother only the immediate relatives of
the contracting parties witnessed the cere
mony.
Dr. Voorsanger read the impressive cere
mony that united ' tbe happy young
couple.
Miss Fechheimer for the past few sea
sons has been a popular belle in the ex
clusive circle in which she moved. En
dowed with rare personal attraction and
mental attainments, she commanded un
limited attention and admiration.
In spite of the fact that no invitations
were issued for tne wedding the bridal
presents were extremely numerous and
unusually elegant. There weie rare pieces
of porcelain, crystal and bric-a-brac, some
exquisite paintings and quantities of ele
gant silver.
The fair young bride looked very lovely
in her simple wedding gown of white tulle
over a foundation of white satin. The
dress was destitute of all adornment. She
wore a bridal veil, fastened to the coiffure
by a wreath of orange blossoms, and car
ried a prayer-book.
The bride was attended by her two lit
tia cousins. Miss Anna Liebenthal and
Miss Edith Greenebaum. These two
charming little misses were attired alike
in dainty frocks of white organdie over
light blue silk. Light-blue moire sashes
were tied about tbe waists and fell in long
ends to the hem of the skirts.
After the ceremony a dejeuner was
served.
Mr. and Mrs. Lilienfeld have left for a
southern bridal trip, and on their return
will reside at the Colonial.
MRS. DONAHUE`S WILL PROBATED
Baroness yon Schroeder Has a Tear In
Which to File a Contest.
The will of the late Mrs. Annie Dona
hue, widow of Peter Donahue, was ad
mitted to probate by Judge Belcher,
sitting in Judge Slack's department of the
Superior Court, yesterday morning.
The court finds and so declares that the
will and codicils were signed and pub
lished in tbe presence of two competent
witnesses, as required by law, and that
Mrs. Donahue, at the time of making the
will and codicils, was of sound and dis
posing mind and not under restraint, un
due influence, menace, frand, duress or
fraudnlent misrepresentations, or in any
respect incompetent to devise and be
queath her estate.
Considerable talk has been caused since
Mrs. Donahue's death by the report that
Baroness yon Schroeder, stepdaughter of
the testator, would contest the will on
account of the fact that she was prac
tically ignored in the distribution of the
$5,000,000 estate.
The only things bequeathed to the
baroness are the family pictures and busts,
while the dollars go to relatives* of the
decedent and to several worthy public
charitable institutions.
As no opposition to the probate of the
will was offered yesterday it appears that
Mrs. yon Rchroeder has no present inten
tion to oppose the carrying of its pro
visions into effect. She has a year in
which to move to set aside the admission
of the will to probate if she should decide
to do so.

The Regular Christmas .Festival of
the Society Ended Yesterday
With Much Joy.
There was a busy scene in California
Hall yesterday. The entrance was crowded
with poor women, many of them old and
faeble. Young girls poorly dressed, and
little children, pale-faced and pinched,
stood in the corridors waiting until the
door should be opened to them and the
distribution of New Year gifts should
begin.
On the other side of the door, pierceable
by the X ray of anxious poverty, a com
mittee of ladies of the German Ladies' Be
nevolent Society were busy in doing up in
boxes and bundles the gifts of clothing,
groceries and other necessaries for the
poor women and children outside. This
work was done on four long tables which
were piled with clothing, toys, cans of
tomatoes and corn, smoked shoulders of
pork, bags of candies, apples, oranges and
lemons, sugar, tea and coffee, boots and
shoes, children's dresses, and lots of other
things, the mention of which would be as
long as the catalogue at a San Francisco
art sale.
This society has done a remarkable deal
of good in an unostentatious way. Its
charges are poor German-speakine; people,
mostly women and children. Many of
the women who are cared for are old and
decrepit and practically unable to care
for themselves. To them the ladies of
the society are as ministering angels.
The work of receiving donations and
purchasing supplies had been going on for
two or three days and the distribution be
gan yesterday. Each applicant had v card
containing her name and number and tbe
box or bundle intended for her was
marked with the number, all the appli
cants being personally known to the soci
ety and, in fact, being regularly the recip
ients of its bounty.
A snort time ago the society gave a se
ries of promenade concerts at the Pavilion,
the net proceeds of which amounted to
$1200. This money will be expended in
the support of the indigent families in the
society's charge. The individuals depend
ent upon the efforts of these noble and
self-sacrificing ladies numbar from 175

IT'S CURES
THAT COUNT.
Many so-called remedies are
pressed on the public attention
on account of their claimed
large sales. But sales cannot
determine values. Sales simply
argue good salesmen, shrewd
puffery, or enormous advertis-
ing. J>.'s cures that count. It
js cures that are counted on by
Ayer's Sarsaparilla. Its sales
might be boasted. It has the
world for its market. But
sales prove nothing. We point
only to the record of Ayer's
Sarsaparilla, as proof of its
merit :

MRS. FAIR'S ESTATE
IS PROSPEROUS
It Is Gaining in Value
More Than $2000 a
Month.
Trustee Dey Draws Something
Like $20,000 for His
Services.
Mrs. Theresa Ann Oelrichs Appears
as One of tbe Debtors of Her
Mother's Estate.
John W. Mackay and Richard V. Dey
have filed their first and second annual
accounts as trustees of the estate of Mrs.
Theresa Fair, deceased. The first account
bears date of October 25, 1895, and was
sworn to on that day, but was presented
to the Probato Court only yesterday.
The list of bills allowed shows com
mendable economy in the management of
tne estate, the gas bill at the residence in
this City, for instance, averaging only 60
cents a month, except when Mrs. Oelrichs
and Miss Fair were here for four weeks,
when the gas cost $32 50. Byron Waters
and W. F. Herrin come in for some mod
erate attorneys' fees in tax suits, amount
ing to about $1500 in all, but as Mr. Dey
acts as attorney for himself and Mr.
Mackay in the management of the trust,
no lawyers' fees are incurred on that ac
count. The care of the house costs $80 a
month and the care of the garden $75 a
month.
One cause of considerable expense is the
Bella Vista Hotel, which requires repairs
nearly every month, but as $600 a month
rent is collected on' account of that hotel,
the property shows a net income.
January, 1895, may be regarded as a
sample month so far as receipts are con- .
cerned. It shows receipts as follows:
Pacific Improvement Company, one
â  iuODth's interest on note 8-00.000,
at 6 per cent per annum $1,000 00
Mrs. Volney f-paldinij, rent of Belia
Vista Hotel for December, 1894 600 0U
W. Hobart, rent lÂ»ine-s reel stable
for January, 189S 75 00
fcouthern Pacific Hallway Company of
Arizona, 6-per-cem bonds, six
months' interest on $1.885,000 56,550 00
Vest Shore Hallway 4-per-cent bonds,
six months' Interest on $27,000 540 00
Commercial Cable company's slock,
dividend on 625 shares at $1 75 per
share 1,093 75
Total for month $59.858 76
â¢ In July of 1895 the Pacific Improvement
Company paid $1000 as interest on their
$200,000 note and $375 - as interest on their
$75,000 note; the Northern Railway of
California paid interest amounting to $42,
-390; the Southern Pacific Railroad of Ari
zona paid six months' interest on $1,285 -
000, amounting to $38,550, and a few minor
sums was also collected.
The insurance premium on the Bella
Vista Hotel, the property being valued at
$144,000, amounts to $2880 a year.
Messrs. Mackav and Dey paid to Tax
Collector Block $10,712 05 as taxes on per
Present Location on Telegraph Hill of the Familiar Time Ball
That May Be Moved to the Ferry Tower.
The time-ball that every day at exactly 12 o'clock slides down a pole on tbe
summit of Telegraph Hill will, through tbe sugte.xtion of the United States Hydro
grai>nic Bureau, probably be moved to the top of the bieh tower on the new ferry
building, directly at the end of Market street and midway of the extensive and busy
water front.
A letter was received by the Chamber of Commerce yesterday from Lieutenant
Hughes of the local bydrographic office. He called attention to the propriety and
advisability of the change when the tower of the new public building shall have been
completed and ready to -accommodate the ball nnd the little electrical mechanism
controlling it and operated by wire from the Mare Island Navy-yard.
The reasons given for the change are that the ball is now on private property, the
.picturesque mock castle with its wooden battlements belonging to Mayor Sutro. The
new ferry building is public property. Its tower will be at the very entrance to the
heart of the City, conspicuously at the end of tbe main thoroughfare and in the
midst of the shipping. The ferry building is practically being paid for by shipping
interests, and if any immediate advantage should accrue to the shippers on that
account, it is believed that when the time-ball must be moved to public property it
ought to De plnced on the ferry tower.
For the last nine years the time-ball has daily been drawn up to the top of the
poietm tbe main tower of the old and long-unused Telegraph Hill beer-castle. Each
day it has remained near the top of the pole during the ten minutes preceding the
noon hour, and citizens have watched and waited for it to drop that they might set
their chronometers to the correct time.
Captain William L. Merry, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, looks with
favor upon the proposed change. He said yesterday that when the trustees again
meet on January 12 they will undoubtedly recommend to the Harbor Commissioners
that the time-ball be moved to the ferry tower. He thinks that the proposed location
â¢would be a better one than the to^> of Telegraph Hill, where, he asserts, the fall is
hidden in thick weather. On tbe othei hand the ferry tower, though it would not be
visible to shipping north and west of Telegraph Hill, would be in plain sight of all
outward-bound vessels.
At the office of the Harbor Commissioners nothing had yet been heard of the pro
posed change. One of the officers had been informed, however, that either the main
weather signal station wili^je moved to tbe ferry tower from the top of the Mills build
ing, or an auxiliary weather signal station will surely be located in the tower when
it shall have been completed a year hence, for from the top of the tower the signal
flags could be displayed to igreat advantage.
The lime- ball, though it appears like a toy balloon in size, is four feet in diameter,
and so large that two men reaching around it can just touch each other's hands. It
U made of black paiuted canvas over an iron framework.
sonal property, under protests, and suit
for the recovery of that money is yet pend
ing.
John W. Mackay and R.V.Day were paid
as executors fees in lull as per order of the
Probate Court $3960 89. Mr. Mackay
waived his share in iavor of Mr. Dey.
During ttie time covered by the first re
port a large amount was paid tc the heirs
on account of their inheritance and their
monthly allowances. Of this Mrs. The
resa A. Oslrichs took $240,460 on the 20th
of February, 1895, and Virginia Fair and
Charles L. Fair were granted their regular
allowances of $2500 and $500 a month re-
spectively.
The year's report shows a decrease of
assets on hand, the reduction being ac
counted for by the extraordinary outlays
required in settling with the heirs for cer
tain pressing claims. The trustees re
ceived from the execulors on August 20,
1894, the sum of $477,688 28, and on August
20, 1895, they had on hand $354,05417.
Tli- year's disbursements amounted to
$352,7^6 18.
The balance was reported to be invested
as follows: Notes of Pacific Improvement
Company, $275,000; note of Mrs. Theresa
A. Oelrichs. $14,732; cash in American
Exchange National Bant of New York,
$17.450 67; ca*h in Nevada Bank of San
Francisco, $45,879 84; cash on hand,
$99166.
The report for the year ending Augnst
20, 1896, is iv great part a repetition of the
transactions of the previous year, witu the
exception that Mrs. Oelrichs had in
creased her indeotedness to the estate of
her mother, and that on October 30, 1895,
the Pine-street stable property was sold
to Walter S. Hobart for $11 000
Tne receipts for the year weft $204, 119 38,
and the expenditures for the same period
were $74,691 39. These outlays included a
monthly a lowance of $2500 to Virginia
Fair and $500 to Charles L. Fair. 8, V.
Smith and Mrs. C. B. bmith borrowed
$30 000 from the estate.
The balance reported August 20, 1896, is
$483,482 16, showing a gain of over $iÂ»,-
OQO for the year, invested as follows : Notes
of Pacific Development Company, $335,
-000; notes of Mrs. Oelrichs. $94,196; note
of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, $30,000; cash in
American Exchange Bank of New York,
$11,827 50; cash in Nevada Bank of San
Francisco, $10,938 49; cash on hand,
$1520 17.
Mr. Mackay's affidavit to this second
year's account was taken in >iew York
City on the 7th day of the present month
and Mr. Dey swore to his report on the
16th in st.
Following the affidavit of Messrs.
Macfcay and Dey in each case, that their
report is true and just in every particular,
is thÂ© following attestation by Mra. Oe -
richs and Miss Fair, the years' only dif
fering:
I declare that I have fully examined the
foregoing accounts of the trustees of the
estate of Theresa Fair, deceased, running from
the 20th of August, 1894, to the 20th of Au
gust, 1895, with the vouchers accompanying
the same, and am fully informed in relation
thereto; and I approve of, ratify and confirm
the said accounts as being in all respects just
and true, and the expenditures and outlays
therein specified were properly made. And I
consent to the settlement and allowance of
said account, without notice being given of
the time and place of such settlement.
Theresa Ann Oelrichs,
Virginia Fair.
In all the management of the trust Mr.
Mackay Das left tbe active work to Mr.
Dey and has yielded to him all the emolu
ments growing out of the trust. For the
two years ending in last August these
emoluments amounted to something like
$40,000.
Judge Coffey has fixed to-morrow as the
day for hearing the application to settle
the account, at which time all parties in
terested are invited to be present.
Damage** for Injuries.
The Supreme Court has denied a new trial to
D. M. Osborne & Co., against whom James H.
Gaggin secured a judgment for damages on
account of the fall of a freight elevator.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1896.
NO MORE PEELS
ON THE SIDEWALKS
An Ordinance Passed by
the Supervisors Yes
terday.
Supervisor Taylor Resigned One
0 fi:e to Accept
Another.
The Lights on Valencia Street Will
Not Be Changed From Gas to
Electric Lamps.
No more will the slippery banana or
orange peel endanger the life and limb of
the unconscious pedestrian, if the order
of the Supervisors is obeyed. The ordi
nance proposed by the Board of Health,
making the throwing of such rubbish on
the floors of public buildings, on the side
walks or in streetcars was finally passed,
and now only awaits the Mayor's signa
ture to become a full-fledged law.
The board indefinitely postponed con
sideration of the order prohibiting expec
toration in like places. This is equivalent
to rejecting the matter entirely unless the
incoming board decides to take it up and
help out the Board of Health.
Supervisor Hobbs made a vain effort to
revive the matter :of lighting Valencia
street from Market to Twenty-fifth with
electric lamps instead of the gas lights
now in use. The subject was discussed
some time ago, but no action was taken
beyond an adverse report for the commit
tee, and the member trom the Eleventh
tried to have it passed on a ' resolution
fathered by himself. Only two votes
were recorded in favor of the measure. â â *
In order to pave his way to accepting
the office of Gas and Water Inspector, to
which he was recently elected by a unani
mous vote of the board. Supervisor C. L.
Taylor tendered his resignation as a mem
ber of the board, to take effect on Decem
ber. 31. It was accepted, and Mr.
Taylor will assume his new duties on Jan
uary 1. His bond, in the sum of $10,000,
with L. Van Lack and It. D. Chandler as
sureties, was approved.
His office is now being renovated and
arranged in expectation of his occupancy.

SACRAMENTO BENCH SHOW.
There Will Be No Alterations in the
Dates Announced for the Exhibition.
The advisory board of tne Pacific Ken
nel Club met last evening in tbe office of
Field Sports purposely to hear and pass
upon a report from th- Sacramento Ken
nel Club in reference to tbe holding of its
bench show on a Sunday. The American
Kennel Club, which determines all ques
tions of doubt relative to kennel matters
throughout the country, decided to leave
the matter in the hauds of the Pacific ad
visory board, and that body decided to
allow the Sacramento Kennel Club to ex
hibit (heir dogs on Sunday, January 10.
The Sacramento club claimed the dates
January 9 to 12 for its show, and the ad
visory board adjudged tiuit it would be
doing an injustice to the sportsmen of the
capital city if it were to deny them tbe
permission to bold tbe show on the days
which have been so extensively adver
tised. The entries for tne show will close
with the secretary, W. &. LaOd of Stock
ton, on January 1, and from all accounts
a large number of entrants will be re
ceived.
A meeting of the Pacific Kennel Club
will he held on January 6 at the Breeder
and Sportsman office for the purpose of
discussing the advisability of holdine a
beach show in this City next year.
Will Entertain Ladies.
Charles G. Clinch, F. W. Hinckley, 8. J.
Hendy and George H. Pippy of the Union
League Club met as a committee last evening
to perfect arrangements for a club reception
to ladles on Friday evening, January 8. There
will be music, feasting and flowers. Members
of the club only will be privileged to invite
ladies to the function.
Furnisher Attached.
Nathan Oants, a ladies' farnishing-gooda
dealer at 1132 Market street, was attached

TWO SUSPECTED
BURGLARS CAUGHT
James Daly and Martin
Deary Are in the
Tanks.
They Were Arrested by Three
0 ficers in the Western
Addition.
Daly Had a Long Dagger in His
Pocket and Deary a Quantity of
Burglars' Toois.
Two men, who are suspected by the
police of being implicated in many of the
recent burglaries in the City, were arrested"
last night by Detective Wren and Polica
men Harry Hook and Amos Williams.
The men are James Daly and Martin
Deary, who have been in the burglary
business for several years, and have served
terms for their crimes.
The three officers had been specially de
tailed to keep a vigilant lookout for the
burglars, and their suspicions fell upon
Daly and Deary. They were closely
watched and last night they were captured
while prowling round a house in the
Western Addition.
They attempted to get away but the offi
cers were too quick for them, and in a few
minutes they were overpowered and
manacled.
When searched at the City Prison a
murderous looking dagger with a sharp
blade about eight inches long was found
in Daly's pocket. It was in a sheath
knife, and is one of the most formidable
looking weapons that could be conceived.
Deary had a number of skeleton keys
in his pockets, and a "jimmy," showing
that both men were fully prepared for busi
ness. They are both desperate looking
men, and Deary's complexion would lead
to the belief that he had Indian blood
in his veins.
The men were registered on the detinue
book, and meantime the police will en
deavor to bring home some of the recent
burglaries to them. Otherwise Daly will
have a cliarge of carrying a concealed
weapon booked against him and Deary a
charge of having burglars' tools in his
possession.
Their capture is looked upon as an im
portant one, but the police refuse to give
out any particulars concerning their arrest.
Divorce Suit* Filed.
Yesterday was a bad day for Eugenias in the
divorce court. Eugenia O. Pomeroy sued
Charles H. Pomeroy for a divorce, and Kugeuia
Martin instituted a similar action against P.

Case for Presentation to the
Supreme Court All
Made Up.
Oral Arguments Will Supple
ment Care ully Prepared
Brieis.
Under the Stipulation B tween the
Attorneys ihe Time for Delay
Has Expired.
Theodore Durrant's attorneys will to
morrow file their answer to Attorney-
General Fitzgerald's stinging reply brief
in the Supreme Court. This is in obedi
epce to the stipulation entered into on the
iilst inst. between Attorney-General Fitz
gerald, General Dickinson and Eugene F.
Deuprey, in which the time for Durrant's
attorneys to act in this regard was limited
to ten days.
Notice may not have been attracted
much by the fact that on the 21st inst. the
order of submission was not set aside.
That order Btands, and the stipulation
concerning the ten days prevents any fur
ther delay in getting at the final hearing
on the merits of Durrant's appeal, consci
entiously and laboriously prepared by his
attorneys, through which Durrant hopes
to secure a new trial.
The oral arguments of the Attorney-
General and of Messrs. Dickinson and
Deuprey will follow the filing of the an
swer to the Atiorney-Goneral's brief in
Dehalf of ttie people. Therefore all that
can be said for Durrant and ali that can
be said against the appeal on the part of
the people will soon be uttered, and there
is reason to suppose that the proceedings
will be attended with much greater inter
est than customarily characterizes pro
ceedings in the Supreme Court.
-Some curiosity is naturally expressed
concerning the contents of the answer
which will be filed by Durraut's attorneys.
Messrs. Dickinson and Deuprey in their
brief attacked tne witnesses for the people
who claim to have seen Durrant about the
church where the bodies of Blancae La
ment and Minnie Williams were found.
They wound up with the assertion that
Durrant is innocent On the other hand
Attorney-General Fitzgerald expressed the
opinion in his reply brief that the wit
nesses were credible, that Durrani's alibi
was not sound, and that the circumstan
tial evidence against Durrant pointed him
out as the guilty person.
Many appeals are brought before tne
court by prisoners condemned of murder
and several are now pending. This may
have influenced the Attorney-General to
urae on the hearing of the case in which
most of the public attention is centered.
Many lawyers and others will probably
listen to the final presentation of the ar
gnment, pro and con, to the Supreme
Court. Then that tribunal will take the
matter under advisemeut and the life ol
Durrant may depend on the result

Mr. Jackson was liable to live for a long

could speak more definitely to-day.

AN ARTIST`S VACATION.
Edward Cucuel's Iteturn to San Fran
cisco After an Absence of five
Year*.
Edward Cucuel, one of the prominent
artists of the New York Herald, is visit
ing his family and friends in San Fran
cisco. He arrived here the day before
Christmas and will leave for New York in
a few days. Mr. Cucuel studied in the
San Francisco Art School under Director
Matthews and was subsequently attached
to The Call's staff of artists. He went to
Paris from San Francisco and devoted four
years' time abroad to the study of art
in illustration. He illustrated for the
Parisian press before he was engaged on
the New York Herald.
In Paris Mr. Cucuel met many Ameri
can students, and among them quite a
number from California. Redmond
Thorndyke, Fonda, Seawell and Altman
have made marked progress. Altman's
work has received the highest recognition.
The big French pa nters, like Jerome,
fancy American boys, preferring them to
the English. Cas aipne, whose work in
the Century has attracted so much notice,
was very popular 111 Paris.
Mr. Cucuel tells of many interesting in
cidents of his student life in Paris. Com
modore Harry Giilig was in Paris last year
and gave the American artists a swell
dinner, which lasted all night. Special
care was taken to rally all theCali ornians
in the Latin Quarter, and the banquet was
one of the events of the season. The
American students in Paris have formed
an association or club, and the institution
nas attained great popularity.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1896.
LAGUNA SURVEY
LOTS ARE EXEMPT
Owners Need Not Pay for
the Grading of Union
Street.
upervisors Were Without Juris
diction to Order the Work
Done.
Decision Concerning Many Property.
Owners Rendered by the Supreme
Court Yesterday.
The Supreme Court yesterday handed
down a decision of much interest to
owners of real estate on Union street,
between Larkin and Franklin. The
case is known as that, of Spaulding
against Wesson and others. Wesson, the
defendant in the suit, became vested in
1872 with a title to a 100-vara lot, which
had been granted by Leavenwortb, then
Alcalde of San Francisco, in 1848. This
100-vara lot embraced ttie premises of
Wesson, and also a portion of Union street
fronting thereon.
A part of Union street, situated be
tween Larkin ana Franslin, is in what is
known as the Laguna survey. In this
tract were several 100-vara lots, which
were conveyed by Leaven worth in 1848,
these being contiguous to each other with
out any intervening street. Union street
was projected throuuh the tract by the
Van Ness ordinance, but it has been held
in Scott vs. Dyer, 54 Cal., 430, that by the
Leavenwortb grants the grantees became
the absolute owners of the lands granted
and that no portion of tb?se lands could
be appropriated to the use of the public as
a street, except upon making compensa
tion therefor.
August 13, 1877, a resolution was adopted
by the Board of Supervisors ordering the
grading of Union street from Larkin to
the westerly line of Franklin. After the
work was done action was begun to re
cover the street assessment upon the land
of Wesson. Judgment was rendered for
the plaintiff. Spaulding and the defend
ants appealed. The lower court found
that the Supervisors had acquired juris
diction to order the work at the daieof
the passage of the resolution. The de
fendants contested tnis strongly. Tne
Supreme Court finds that the Supervisors
had no jurisdiction and has remanded the
case for t>. new trial.
A part of the decision of the court is in
teresting, as it defines the exact status of
the land granted by Leavenworth. "The
street improvement act, " so the decision
reads, "under which these proceedings
were had, cave to the Board of Supervisors
authority to order the improvement of
only public streets; and when it was
sbown that tne greater part of Union
street between Larkin and Franklin was
held in private ownership and had not
been dedicated to public use, it was clear
that the order for its grading and all the
proceedings taken thereunder were with
out authority and were ineffectual to cre
ate a lien upon adjacent lands."
A dedication of the street in front of
one lot, the court also found, would not
have the eftect to dedicate other portions
of the street which were held by different
owners. The improvement of the street
from Larkin to Franklin was an entirely,
and unless the Board of Supervisors had
jurisdiction to order the grading of the
whole of that portion of the street no por
tion of the expense could be made a lien
upon the defendant's lot.
The entire cost of the grading was by
the act to be assessed upon the entire
frontage, and each lot at a rate per front
foot sufficient to cover the total expense
of the work. There was no authority tO
charge the defendant's lot with the bur
den of any portion of the expense of grad
ing private property adjacent thereto
which lay within the lines of the street,
and an assessment which included such
charges would be invalid. Unless there
was jurisdiction in the municipality to
make the improvement at the time the or
der was passed such jurisdiction could not
be established by a subsequent dedication
of the street.

HONORS TO A SOLDIER
An Ovation to Maj :r-General
Frank J Herron in
Dubuqu-% Icwa.
The Hero May Be Recognized by
President-E ect McKinley's
Admin straticn*
There are not many survivors of the war
for the preservation of the Union who at
tained the rank of major-general for gal
lant service on the field of battle. One of
the few living heroes is Major-General
Frank J. Herron, whose military record
makes a bright page in the history of
lowa soldiers. It is said that he was the
youngest major-general in the Union
army. It wa3 his good fortune to com
mand the army that fought the battle of
Prairie Grove, Ark., and there he achieved
a brilliant and substantial victory. This
gallant soldier went to the front at Presi
dent Lincoln's first call for troops. He
left his home in Dubuque, lowa, witn the
Governor's Greys, which became Com
pany I, First lowa Infantry, and gained
renown for bravery at the battle of Wil
sons Creek. At the bead of the First
lowa fell the noble General Nathaniel
Lyon.
When the Nintn lowa was organized at
Dubuque Frank J. Herron was commis
sioned lieutenant-colonel of the regiment.
At the battle of Pea Ridge, Ark., March
6, 7 and 8, 1862, where Generals Curtis,
Ashboth, Siegel, Carr, Dodge and Jeff C.
Davis commanded the Union forces and
Generals Van Doren, Price, McCullough,
Mcintosh and Rains led the Confeder
ates, the Ninth lowa bore a prominent
part. Colonel Herron was wounded dur
ing the hard fighting of the second day.
About the time that Herron fell General
Ben McCullough and General Mclntosh
of the Confederate army were slain. It
was the fortune of war that the wounded
colonel should fall into the enemy's hands.
Recovering from bis wounds he was ex
changed and appointed to lead the army
against the Coniederate general Ilmdmau.
At Prairie Grove the battle which gave
the Southwest to the Union was won by
General Herron.
General Herron, now 65 years of age,
recently received an ovation at Dubuque,
lowa, bis old home, which has attracted
National attention. Returning from Mex
ico, -where he has interests in silver mines,
he wa3 invited to a reunion of his com
rades at Dubuque. All classes of people
joined in a demonstration of welcome.
For three days his rooms at the Hotel
Julien were thronged wiih visitor?. He
paid visits to Grand Army posts, went to
Li n wood Cemetery and attended the Sec
ond Presbyterian Churcn with his old
friend, Senator Allison. It is mentioned
in tne Dubuque papers, which gave elabo
rate accounts of the reception, that when
General Herron and the old Governor's
Grays left Dubuque in 1861 for the war not
one of the members of the present Gover
nor's Grays was born.
lowa people reverence the men who
went to the front in 1861, and no citizen of
the State is held hi her in public esteem
than General Frank Herron. He is now
in his intellectual prime. His ability and
years of experience qualify him for public
place of hieb station. It is said that the
lowa delegation in Congress will ask
Major McKiniey to tender to General Her
ron an appointment worthy of the hero.

refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weatherand rains.
"Lows" usi.ally first appear on the Washington
coast. WhfD the pressure is high in tho interior
and low alo;>g the coas;, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is Inclosed with isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and

weather may be expected in summer and colder

Will produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
rrriCAGO. To*. Dec. 29 âA further enhance
ment in the price of wheat took place to-day. As
on yester.iay there was no heavy tradine. very
little buying being sufficient to establish an ad
vance. A gain of %d at Liverpool afforded en-
I couragement to holders and purchasers, and very
) soon after the opening May wheat was % Â°i a
I cent over yesterday's c ose. The arrivals of wheat
at Liverpool tor three days were heavy at 79-.000
bushels while only a small portion â¢ f tbe amount,
32.0J0 bushels, was American grain. This servea
to cause some disappointment and helped to tem
porarily check the aavance, although sM'ing
against calls was the main obstacle. Keceipts at
Lbicaeo were 51 cars and 29,996 bushtls were
taken from store.

908 Broadway, Dec. 29. J
Each member of the Alameda delegation
to the Legislature is working hard upon
some pet scheme which he thinks will
inuro to the benefit of his district. As
semblyman Leavitt will probably take up
some measure that will take the place o
his water-front bill, which he has with
drawn, and Assemblyman Hart North has
prapared a new primary election law bill,
which will, he claims, be acceptable to all
parties and be held to be constitutional by
the Supreme Court. Mr. Broiling will
k handle the West Oakland marsh.
1 Mr. North has published a copy of his
bill, so that it might be discussed during
the next few days and any improvements
suggested by those whose experience may
be greater than his own. His bill is very
lengthy, but in brief it provides that the
primaries of al! parties shall be held on
the same day, but that each side shall
print its own ticket. It provides for a
proclamation to be issued thirty days be
fore the time to hold the primary election,
by the governing body of each "county or
city. Any and all persons interested may
provide printed tickets lor use as ballots
at primary elections, but they shall all be
printed upon uniform white paper, which
shall be furnished at cost by the Board of
Supervisors.
The polls must be opened at 7 a. m. and
closed at sundown, and all the details
connected with the counts shall be in all
respects as provided in the general elec
tion law, witn the same right of challenge
and the same penalties ior violation of the
provisions of the peneral election law.
â¢ ..The Boards of Sjpervisors must elect the
". -primary election officers, an-i not more
than one judee and cierk must be from
. Â«ny one "political party, and they must all
serve without compensation, and any one
Â° who shall refuse to serve without -utticient
.cause shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
The concluding sections of the bill maUe->
the cost of conducting primary elections a
county charge, and fixes the penalty for
violation of the primary election law at
$500 or imprisonment in the County Jail
for six months.

of the city electric light plant to-day.
" Many little incidents occurred to keep

The inquisitive student was not badly

he received the full force of the current
he would surely have been killed. He
went home with his classmates.
The Watson Divorce.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Dec. 29.â Mrs. Elmira
F. Wataon, who formerly resided at 1011
Morton street with her nusband, testified
in court to-day before Judge Ogden that
her husband had drawn a pistol oa her on
the street when one of his own frier.ds
raised his hat to her as he spoke to her
husband. Sne said he had become jeal
ous of the Rev. W. W. Scudder of the
First Congregational Church when he
called upon her as a member of his flock.
At another time, when coming out ol the
church, as was his custom, Deacon Agery
shook bands with her. This so enraged
the jealous man that he jumped between
her and the good deacon.
Mrs. Watson was the first witness in the
divorce case now pending wherein she
cnarges her husbaml with extreme cruelty
and jealousy. Mr. Watson filed a crosb
complaint chareing her with infidelity.
Every step has been a bitter fight with
property rights and custody of children
interwoven. One of the witnesses, a little
boy, died recently.
A Baby Badly Burned.
ALAMEDA, (Jal., Dec 29.â Little Clara
Dolores Brown, the rhree-vear-old daughter
of Horace P. Brown of 2126 Clement ave
nue, was nearly burned to deatU yester
day afternoon while playing with her doll
in the parlor. She sat on the floor near
the grate, and in some way her dress
ignited and before she was found was
nearly suffocated. Her mother saw the
baby's plight ana she grabbed a rug and
rolled the child in it. The little one's
hands and face were terribly burned and
its little body charred in places. She in
stinctively held her breath and put her
bands over her eyes, thus saving her si^ht
and her lungs, but her lips were blistered.
Dr. Keyes dia all he could to alleviate the
sufferer and pronounces her resting as
easily as could b? expected to-night.
DOCKAGE AND TOLLS.
Interesting Figures Regarding the
City's Business at the Wharves.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 29â The city of
Oakland, with its thirteen miles of water
front, holds only two wharvesâ at Frank
lin and Webster streets and the interven
ing block â without dispute, and it is here
that all the commerce of the city is cjone.
But from a short review of the figures it
can be seen what may be expected when
the city secures undisputed control of the
balance and invites the commerce of the
world to the city.
â¢During the ten months from March 1,
1895, to January 1, 1896, the city received
irora this small section of wharfage the
! sum of $3318 45 in dockage fees, $2949 25
i in tolls and $2l 25 for wharfage, a total of
$6288 95. The present year has been a
poor one in all lines of business. The to
tal receipts to date, with estimates for the
next two days, show $3596 82 collected
lor dockage, $3631 86 for tolls and $10 for
wharfage, a total of $7238 68.
Jarvis Withdraws.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 29.â This after
noon F. C. Jarvis, tne recent candidate of
the Republicans for Supervisor from the
First District, who has been contesting
the election of Thomas D. Wells, the
fusion candidate, notified the court he
was satisfied from the reconnt as far as it
had proceeded, ti at he had no cause to
carcplain and would like to withdraw his
contest. The <;ourt allowed the request
and made an order fixing Wells' majority
at 24. It was 33 under the official canvass
of the votes by the Supervisors.
Blanket Mortgage.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 29.â The San
Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Rail
way Company filed a blanket mortgage on
all of its property in this county to-day in
favor of the Mercantiie Trust Company of
New York to secure an issue of $6,000,000
wor'h ol bond*. The filing of the deed
here is considered significant, as showing
that the company exiects to do business
in Alameda County in the future.
Portuguese Union.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 29â The Portu
guese Union of California has organized a
new council in this city with the following
officers: F. J. Lemos, supervisor, presided,
anil L. J. Mart:n, supervising Secretary
and the majority of the supreme oflic als
of the U. P. E. C. of California instituted
Oakland Council No. 20 with twenty-six
charter members, the most of any council
of this order ever instituted before. After
the institution the following officers were
elected and installed : J. H. Woods, presi

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1896.
MUST NOT FISH
FROM THE PIER
A Barbarous Wire Fence
Erected by the Rail
road Company.
Little Boys Who Went to Fish
at Dusk Were Injured by
the Barbs.
Cannot Ba Arrested for Trespassin?,
So Are Prev?nted by Other
Means.
Oakland Office Saw Fbancisoo Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec 29. j
For over a quarter ot a century crowds
of fishermen and fisherboys have gone to
West Oa&land pier daily to try and take a
meal out of the bay. If they wish to do so
in future at the narrow-gauge pier they
will have to provide themselves with
barbed- wire- proof suits.
During the past few days the openings
between the piles have been liberally pro-
How the Southern Pacific Prevents Boys From Taking a Meal
Out of the Bay.
tected with fierce-looking barbed-wire.
The crowds of fishermen would undoubt
edly have been arrested for trespassing
many years ago, had the railroad company
not been aware of the fact that by bring
ing up a question of trespass it woukt^be
necessary for them to prove title to the
property, and whenever title has been
mentioned in connection with water-front
property everything pertaining thereto
has invariably been dropped.
The reason given by the railroad em
ployes ior (he formidable fence is to pre
vent danger from small boys who might
be tempted to iump on and off the boats,
but such danger does not appear to be
any greater now than twenty years ago,
when other small uoys caught fish at the
wharf and were not protected by a barbed
fence.
Two boys who live in West Oakland
went down to the pier last night to fish as
usual and not being aware of the fence
they attempted to pass between the piles
arid sit upon the stringers to fish. They
now wish they had not, for their faces and
Knees are suggestive of something that
has been in contact with a buzz-saw.
The theory that the wire fence was put
up to protect boys from falling into the
water is not borne out by the length of the
fence, which does not extend more than a
quarter of the way down the pier from the
depot. It oniy toes as far as where the
stern of the boat is abreast of the pier when
it is moored. The best part of the pier for
fishing is right under the barbed fence
and all kinds cf comp aints are being
made by the many sufferers. In West
Oakland there are several people who
depend for their only square meal each
day on what they catch from the piers
and they are highly indignant at being
thus shut out. A doubt has been ex
pressed as to whether or not anybody
being injured by the barbed fence has not
a reasonable ground to ask for damages.
KILLED AND MANGLED
Shots Found in the Remains o
a Man in the Railroad
Yard.
It Is Believed Hi Was Murdered,
Robbed and Then Fat on
the Track-
Oakland Office San Fbanoiboo Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 29. J
This morning the badly mangled re
mains of a man were found on the track
near Peralta street, and an investigation
of them makes it appear that a murder
has been committed.
The body was so terribly cut that it was
impossible to recognize any of the fea
tures, nor was there a whole limb intact.
It was discovered by Watchman Frank
Brown of the railroad company and
taken to the morgue. This afternoon
Brown found a portion of the face, which
had been covered with dirt and over
looked by the Coroner's deputies when
gathering tip the fragments this morning.
A critical investigation of the face
showed that just above the nose a buck
shot had entered, and near this was
another small shot hole. Coroner Bald
win considers this conclusive evidence
that a murder was committed and that
after the man was killed his remains were
placed on the tracK to be run over by
passing trains. Probably not less tnan a
dozen trains ran over the track before the
body was recovered.
It Is impossible for any identification to
be made, as the body was so badly ground
to piecep. ThÂ« part of the city where it
was discovered is frequented by the hard
characters known as the "West Oakland
gang," to whose credit scores of brutal
outrages have been placed during the past
two years.
It is quite likely that if the man was
murdered he was first robbed by the
toughs who live in that locality.
The remains of the man found on the
track were identified to-night as those of
JameÃ Conlin of 654 Linden street. His
sister identified him by portions of hij
clothing. He left home last night at 9:30
and dia not return. He was a member of
the Sporting Life gang, and no one can
occount for the bullet holes in the faca or
for his presence on the track.
NEW YEAR`S RECEPTION
Christlt.ii Association Will Receive
Young Men of the City.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec 29.â The doors
of the Young Men's Christian Association
will be open ail day Friday to the mem
bers, subscribers and the young men of
the city and their friends, and a very
cordial invitation is extended to all such
to be pre-ent. The annual address will be
given at 12 o'clock by the Rev. George C.
Adams, D.D., of San Francisco. The
ladies of the Women's Auxiliary will re
ceive from 2 to 5 P. m., and there will be a
gymnastic exhibition at 3:15 and a basket
ball game at 4 o'clock.
In the evening there will be a concert in
the auditorium under the direction of
Miss Pearl Noble, in which the following
talent will participate: Pacific trio, Miss
Pearl Noble (sopr&no), Miss Mildred
Atnidon Clark (mezzo-soprano), Miss
Maude Noble (contralto); George Me-
Bride, basso; Miss Charlotte Gruenhairen,
violin; Miss M. Gertrude Judd, siffleuse;
Miss Maude Noble, trombone; Miss
E-tther Macomber, readings; Herbert Li.
Grege. 'cello; Roscoe Warren Lucy, piano;
Miss Pearl Noble, cornet; accompanists,
Miss Katherine Comfort and Miss Maude
Noble.
Municipal Politics.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 29.â Municipal
politic^ are somewhat more mixed than
they were a week ago, and the primary
and anti-primary men are further from
harmony.
It cannot be doubted that the Repub
licans who are represented by the com
mittee 01 twenty-one are having a hard
tusk to ngree on a candidate for Mayor.
W. V. Witcher has a strong friend in ex-
Mayor W. K. Davis. John Britton, Coun
cilman Towle and Mr. Davis, are also
mentioned, but Mr. Davis is more often
spoken of as the next member of Congress
from this district.
It is not improbable that the opposition
will tatce the form that it did two years
ago and center itself entirely upon one
man, and at present it looks as though
that man would be John L. Davie. The
city government is viewed differently to
day from what it was two years ago, and
many who were deities then are fallen
idols now. The peculiar acton of the
Municipal League, which fought so val
iantly on behalf of primaries a few mouths
ago, and winch now intends to nominate
men as delegates independent of any pri
mary, has undoubtedly disrupted that
organization and has robbed it of much of
the confidence of the public that it for
merly enjoyed.
W. A. l)ow, at present a Councilman, is
being ardently pushed for the office of
City Attorney, and ex-officio Police and
Fire Commissioner. It is openly stated
that George C. Pardes is his warmest
friend, and if this Oe the case Mr. Dow's
prospects of success can be estimated as
being very bright, for, with the exception
of Nelson, whatever Pardee has wanted in
municipal politics during the past four
years he has almost invariably obtained.
The Populists Intend to put a straight
ticket in the field, and at present nothing
definite is heard from the Democrats. It
is not unlikely that Abe Populists may
make some nominations by way of policy
that the Democrats and Republicans who
want a primary will indorse, and thus
make the municipal campaign as Vigorous
and bitter as it was two years ago.
The Coming Convention.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 29.â The com
mittee of twenty-one of the Republican
City Central Committee met to-night and
agreed upon the manner of naming the
delegates. C. H. Daly, C. H. Merithen,
PaulGoldsmitb, W. A. Rouse, R. D. Hun
ter and George Stanley were appointed to
fill the vacancies on the committee. The
time for holding the convention was
changed from the first to the third Mon
day in January.
Voting by Groups.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec 29.âAssembly
man Hurt H. North has a bill drawn to
change the election law so as to permit
Presidential electois to be voted for by
stamping once opposite a whole group of
names. Jt is believed this will not be in
conflict with the Supreme Court decision,
as a vote for a group of electors is intended
to be a vote for but a single candidate for
President.
May Be Murder.
LIVERMORE, Cal., Dec. 29.â The in
quest on the* remains of Frank Gassique,
who died last evening from concussion of
the brain and as a result of a blow given
by Louis Pettifield, was postponed until
to-morrow at the request of the District
Attorney's office, as they desire to be
represented. Coroner Baldwin came up
and had Dr. Bellamy hula au autopsy,
which showed a congested condition of
the brain, as if from a blow.
The men were engaged in a fistic en
counter Christmas day, and Gassique was
badly worsted and was knocked to the
pavement. Whether the blow or fall
caused the concussion of the brain will be
left for a jury to decide.
Copper Cents Costly.
OAKLAND, Cal.. Dec. 29.â The South
ern Pacific Company has appealed from
the decision of Justice Fred C. Cliff,
awarding G. A. Blank $200 damages and
$14 costs, because the company's agent at
Broadway refused to accept 5 copper cents
for fare.
BARELY ESCAPED DEATH.
Ex-Town Trustee Had lan and Family
Caught In a Blazeâ A Heavy
Lo*g.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 29.â Ex-Town
Trustee Hadlan and family had a narrow
escape from being burned to death early
this morning. His grocery at the corner
of University avenue and Ninth street
caught fire at about 5:30 o'clock while his
family was asleep.
Hadlan, who had just arisen and was in
the stable, saw the blaze issuing from the
grocery over which he and his lamiiy
lived.
Rushing into the building and up the
stairs he barely had time to rescue the
sleepers before the whole house was en
veloped in flames and smoke. Nothing
was saved but the clothes the people wore,
the building haying been gutted.
During the fire a heavy explosion oc
curred, caused by the coaloil cans in the
rear of the store. The grocer sustained a
loss of about $3000, while the owner of the
building was a loser to the extent of
$1000 c thereabouts. Each was Becured
by part insurance on their properties.
Parsing of Arc Lamps.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 29.â An exper
iment of substituting incandescent lights
for arc lamps in street lighting is about to
be undertaken by the Board of Town
trustee j with a view to abolishing arc lamps
altogether. Trustee Martin of the Elec
tric-iight Committee last night presented
a plan 'jr lighting the upper uart of
Dwight way as a test of the incandescent
system. It is proposed to s at off all the
arc lamps on Dwight way east of Tele
graph avenue and place eleven incandes
cent lights on either side of the street. If
the latter are found to afford sufficient
illumination the abolition of 'arc lamps
will be urged by the Light Committee.
Better Police Protection.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 29.â A peti
tion was last niulit presented to the
Town Board by the Good Government
Club, requesting that a plan for a unilorm
system of police pro;ectiÂ»n be adopted.
The plan of the club is ior the appoint
ment of deputy officers in all sections of
the town whence petitions for them are
presented, who are to be paid by the
petitioner- 1 , but are to be under the con
trol of the Town Marshal. The question
was referred to the Town Attorney for an
opinion.
THOSE LIQUOR ADS.
The Objectors Mast Pay Their Value or
They Uo in the Blue and
Gold.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 29.â Manager
Mott of '98s Blue and Gold will probably
have trouble on his hands when the new
term of college opens. He has not heeded
the resolutions pa a sed by the college
Y. M. V. A., demanding that the liquor ad
vertisements be emitted in the Annual,
but has let the contract for "ads" to a San
Francisco concern regardless of the quasi
lnir.nciion passed upon him.
In speaking of the matter to-day, he
said, "Yes, I was impl. red by the Y. M.
C. A. not to accept any liquor "ads,' but 1
simply told them that if they would
Ktiarantee me the amount the 'ads' would
come to I would pladiy letiye them out.
"To this they said nothing. The clas3
has taken no action in the matter, and as
these particular advertisements are of
such financial consequence, and as we
need every cent we can get hold of, I
gueds they will have to go in. We may
have a tight on our hands at the opening
ol the teroi. I am perfectly willing to
acquiesce in the vmhes of the Y. M. C. A.
if ihey will see that the book is paid for.''
UNHEALTHY SCHOOLS.
The New Grand Jury Will Make a
Careful Inquiry Xuto Their Con
dition the First Thing.
The Grand Jury met yesterday for the
first time since its organization and en
tered actively upon its work. The first
business to be taken up is an investiga
tion of the sanitary condition of the pub
lic schools. A committee, consisting of.
Louia d. Ka^t, James W. Cudworth and
R. B. Kittredge was appointed to inquire
particularly into the condition of all the
schools and to report upon the same.
At the same time Foreman Peixotto ad
vised.every member of the jury to visit
and examine the schools that are nearest
their own residences and to report upon
them.
The jury has no intention of interfer
ing in the dispute between the Board of
Health and the Board of Education, but
will take what measures it can toward get
ting the schools into a proper sanitary
condition according as its investigations
may discover the need.
The standing committees will probably
be appointed at the next meeting of the
jury.
Socialist Labor Party.
The State Executive Committee of the So
cialist Labor party met last evening in the
Turk-street Temple, Herman Sahlender acting
as chairman. Reports of encouragement of
the growth of socialist sentiment were re
ceived from various correspondents showing
that three new branches have been instituted
during the past month, viz. : a section at San
Diego, Santa Barbara and Sacramento coun
ties. Liberty branch will be addressed at its
meeting to-night in the temple by Henry
Warnecke Jr. on the subject, '-What It Jus
tice?" W. P. Neergard will preside as chair
man, and short addresses will also be made by
Dr. J. D. O'Brock, Leo Gasser and Theodore
Lynch. Tne evening's programme will In
clude a comic recitation by George Aspden,
the veteran of the local Socialists, entitled
"Pyramus and Thisbe."
NEW TO-DAY.
FREE TO EVERY MAN.
THE METHOD OF A GREAT TREATMENT
for nmvtss of mkS.
WHICH CURED HIM AFTER EVERY-
THING ELSE FAILED.
â  Painful diseases are bad enough, but when a
man is : slowly wasting -.. away . with ; nervous
weakness ? the s mental . forebodings are ten
times worse than the most severe pain. There
is no let up ;to : the mental . suffering day â or
night. Sleep is almost impossible, and': under
such a strain men are scarcely responsible for
what they do. For years the writer rolled and
tossed on the troubled sea of 'sexual weakness
until it was a question whether he had not
better take a dose of poison and thus end ail
his throubles. But providential inspiration
came to his aid In the shape of a combination
of medicines that not only completely restored
the general health, but enlarged his weak,
emaciated parts to natural size and vigor, and
he now declares that any man â¢who will ; take
the trouble to send his name and address may
have the method of this wonderful treatment
free." Now,' when I say free I mean absolutely
without cost, because I want every weakened
man to get the benefit of my experience. -y
I am not a philanthropist, nor do I pose as
an enthusiast, but there are thousands of men
suffering the : mental tortures of ' weakened
manhood who would be cared at " onca â¢ could
they bat get such a remedy as the $ one i that
cured me. Do not try. to study out how I can
afford to pay the few postage-stamps necessary
to mall the information, but send for it and
learn that there are a few things on earth
that, although they cost nothing to get, are
worth a fortune to some men and mean a life-
time iof happiness 'f to . most of i us. Write tto

ANOTHER STAKE
FOR AQUINAS
Headed Out Howard S in
the Pommery Sec at
Ingleside.
Sweet Faverdale, at 30 to 1,
Beat Captive and Other
Fast Company.
Pat Murphy Took the Opening Event
Very Handilyâ Sam Doggett Scored
a Win With Lncky Dog.
The result of the Pommery Sec stakes
was rather disappointing to the large
crowd that visited Ingleside track yester
day. Not that tne win of Barney Bchrei
ber's good youngster Aquinas was dis
tasteful to spectators, but from the size of
the field which dwindled down to but
four starters. Of the original sixty-six
entries to the state, which was worth $1000
to the winner, Aquinas, 'loward 8, Cas
par and Fig Leaf alone faced tbe starter.
Each packed 118 pounds, and Aquinas
ruled an 11 to 10 choice ./hen the bugle
call summoned the starters out. Howard
S receded from 6 to 5 to 3 to 2, while fours
were obtainable against the Burns &
Waterhouse pair. The latter two made
the running to the bend for home, when
Aquinas took the lead and won romping
from Howard S in 1:33 for the seven fur-
Jongs. Caspar led his stable-mate oiu for
third place. Howard S, who had Willie
Martin up to pilot him, appeared unable
to negotiate the heavy going at the outset,
but closed, a vast amount of ground up in
the stretch.
Barney Schreiber was down at the
juage's stand to congratulate little
Slaughter, cast one of his most expansive
smiles at the purple silken bag containing
the purse which swung suspended from
the wire, shook hands with himself on
his good judgment, in picking out year
lings and then returned to his block to
make some more money. This is the sec
ond stake win of tne son of Belvidere since
hi- advent this side of the Rockies.
Again were the favorites in winning
form, taking four of the five events run.
The rrfth race was declared off on account
of tbe lioeral scratching of entries.
In the rirst event decided, a six furlong
spin. Last Chance ana Pat Murphy ruled
equal favorites in the betting. Pat cut out
the pace and simply galloped in ahead
of the 15 to 1 shot Banjo, but Last Chance
â he finished seventh. Harry O, with
Thorpe up, was third.
The one grand, gigantic upset occurred
in the mile purse event, with Sweet Faver
dale, Torsiuo, Captive and Ostler Joe
sporting the colors. Of course Captive,
with 109 pounds up and Willie Martin in
the saddle, was * hot 11 to 20 favorite,
with a quiet tip out on Torsino. The
favorite and Ostler Joe hit the stretch on
nearly equal terms, with Torsino galloping
behind t.. em. Straighten d away for the
wire Slaughter on tbe latter mare let out
a wrap and Jones on Sweet Faverdale did
the same thing. Torsino made a bold
bid tor the coin, but was easily outfooted
by the brown sister to Preston, which won
handily by half a length in I:4s}*. The
favorite finished in the show, 'lue win
ner, Sweet Faverdale, made her initial
start here this season, having been on the
sick list during the Eastern trip the past
summer of the Burns & Waterhouse sta
ble. On this account the ring laid 20 and
even as good as 30 to 1 against her chances.
The fourth race at seven furlongs proved
rather an easy thing for the Corriean en
try Reddington. Starting equal choice in
tr>e betting with Applause, he showed his
fondness lor muddy going by heading his
field before the- stretch was reached, and
winning hands down Irom Hazard. Ap
plause had quite an easy iace and should
do later on.
Up to the last race of the day Jockey
Sam Doggett had yet to ride a winner
since his arrival here, and he celebrated
tne occasion with much eclat. Mounted
astride the even-money chance, Lucky
Dog. he soon showed in the lead, and the
bitr Darebin horse passed the winning line,
puil*d up, four lengths in advance of Ye
mÂ«n. Toano was a good third.
No es.
This is the day set aside st Ingleside
track for receiving the ladies, on which
occasion the gates are free to members of
the fair sex. Six very attractive events,
ranging from six and a half furlongs to
one and a quarter miles, will be decided,
making one of the strongest racing cards
of Hie season. Extra cars win ots ruu over
the Mission-street electric line.

Owners of shortbred horses will be able
to ran the 3eason out. Ed Hopper,
secretary of the Western Turf Congress,
has telegraphed from Cincinnati that
rule 23, regarding the registration of
thoroughbreds, has, at the request of the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club (by unanimous
vote ol the various members of the con
gress), been waived until June 1. 1897, as
it may apply to horses racing in the State
of California. This will > nable shonbred
nor ps to run at lngleside until that date.
Owners and breeder?, however, will have
to register their foals and other horses
eligible in accordance With the rule.
The latest edition of the San Francisco
Turf Gui '.c has ju*t been issued by Wil
lam G. Layng, and the turf department of
The Call acknowledges the receipt of a
copy of same. It is published in a very
concise form and is invaluable to patrons
of the turf.
Carrie U, carrying Tom Griffin's colors,
was accorded considerable support in the
betting on the first race and she displayed
about as much likine for the heavy eoing
as a "yaJler" dog does for rough on rats.
Bookmaker Johnny Coleman was just a
bit wrathy over the showing made by Last
Chance, and il it so happened that just
about the time the chestnut horse finished
seventh, "Daitgie" bmith, his trainer,
were called up in court to answer the
charge of purloining a tin cup from a
blind organ-grinder and CoJeman hap
pened to sit on the jury, Mr. Smith would
probably now be awaiting electrocution.
Pluneer Riley Grannan took a ride on
Pat Murphy and also made his presence
felt in the ring by backing Reddington
very extensively.
Hughey Jones, a very popular member
of the bookmaking fraternity, was fortu
nate enough to have a good bet aboard
Sweet Favordale, clearing up about $2000

PRIZES PRESENTED.
Winners at the Police Competition
With Pocket. Pistols Blade
Happy.
All the members oi : Captain Wittman's
division gathered in tbe assembly-room at
the Central police station yes erday after
noon to witness the presentation of prizes
won by the successful competitors at tha
final match with the pocket pistol Satur
day afternoon.
Captain Wittman made the presenta
tions after an appropriate speech, in
which he congratulated the men for the
excellence of their scores, and upon the
fact that all four prizes were won by mem
bers of his division.
Policeman James Foley was presented
with the hrst prize, an elegant gold star,
donated by Colonel Sam Beaver of the
Bank of California; Policeman O. B. Mer
rick, the second pr ze, a handsome re
volver, donated by General Wall; Police
man Harry Hook, a revolver, donate i by
Captain J. Â£. Klein, and Policeman J. H.
Purves, a hal, donated by Eugene Korn.
The recipients were specially congratu
lated by the Captain, and were loudly ap
plauded by their fellow members.
These were all tne prizes in the com
petition, but a genuine surprise was in
store for Policeman " Scotty" Campbell,
who made the handsome score of 45. He
was called to the front, and the Captain,
after a few congratulatory remarks, pinned
on his breast a handsome silver medal in
tbe snape of a Maltese cross, with a star
pendant encircled witn a wreath. The
medal was suitably inscribed. It was do
nated by the Captain for the improvement
shown oy Campbell in his snooting, the
Captain remarking that when "Scotty"
first fired at the tareet he could not bit it,
but always struck the giound a few feet in
front of him. Campbell received an ova
tion, and the Captain called upon him to
make a few remarks. He did so in his
usual witty style.

THE SAiST FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 30, 1896.
GOOD RED GOLD
FOR HONOLULU
Over a Hundred Thousand
Dollars Bound for
Hawaii.
It Looks as if All the Kanaka
Money Was Being
Called Id.
The Harbor Commissioners Want a
Million to Complete the
Seawall.
Tbe usual crowd assembled on the
Oceanic Steamship Company's dock yes
terday. The occasion was the sailine of
the Australia for Honolulu, and every one
of the forty-five cabin anl twenty steer
age passengers had at iea-t a dozen
friends down to see them off. On this oc
casion the steamer sailed at 2 P. M. in
stead of at 10 a. M., and the rule will hold
good in future. Instead of making fifteen
trips a year the Australia will only make
thirteen, but this will not affect the effi
ciency of tbe service, as the Alameda,
Mariposa and Monowai will more than fill
up the gaps.
Captain McDonald, the weil-known
shipping master, was among the passen
g ts. He goes down to, take command of
one of the Inter-Island Company's steam
erd. A cousin of Consul-General Wilder
also went away on the steamer. She is to
be married upon her arrival in Honolulu.
Another member of the Wilder family,
who was here on a vacation, also left on
the Australia. He made himself very
popular while in San Francisco, and a
number of friends went down to see him
away.
The steamer took away an unusually
rich cargo. Among it was $100,000 in
American gold coin, 10,000 American uol
lars, $1000 in American dimes and $400 in
American nicttfels. This is by f<ir the
largest shipment of American money ever
sent to Hawaii at one time. From this it
would appear as thousrh President Dole
and his Cabinet had decided upon adopt
ing the coinage of the United States.
The Uuited States coast defense steamer
Monadnock has been ordered to sea aud
will sail this morning. Her objective*
point is Santa Cruz, and there the boys in
blue hope to eat their New \ par's dinner.
All of yesterday was occupied in putting
stores and coal aboard, and judging by
the turkeys, meat and vegetables that
went from Folsom-street steps to the
warship all on board should have a hearty
meal.
The branch Hydrograohic Office has
ju-t received the following forecast of
wind and weather in the North Pacific for
January from the head office in Wash
ington.
The trade wind limits will be found a little
farther south than in the previous month.
Between the parallels 35 deg. norih and 80
deg. north, pnd from the American to' the
Asiatic coast, lrequent squalls and gales ac
companied by rain or snow may be expected.
Occasional squalls may be expected in the
vicinity of tne Philippine and Hawaiian isl
ands and in the region of the dolJrums.
Occasional fog will be found along the
American coast duriug January, though not
sufficient to warrant its probable limits being
shown on thecnart.
Occasional spiral circulation, vis., the cyÂ«
clonic (against the sun), with low barometer,
and anti-cyclonic (with the sun), with high
barometer, will be louad. Generally in front
or the cyclonic area, or the low, the weather
is damp with thermometer rising and barome
ter falling, while in front of tbe anti-cyclonic
circulation, or high, it is dry, cooler, and the
barometer rises.
The northeast monsoon on the coast of Asia
will continue to blow steadily during this
month.
Typhoons are infrequent during January.
Currentsâ The currents indicated on the
present issue of the Pilot Chart are those for
the winter months. The data, however, are
meager, and only actual reports to the Hydro
graphic Office from officers of vessels cruising
in thai ocean are taken into consideration.
Special attention in observing and reporting
currents is requested 01 all observers in the
Pacific.
Alter a careful consideration of the reports
o! vessels cruising uear the Aleutian Islands
and in Bering S'ja ;he Hydrographic â  Office
warns mariners against placing too much reli
ance upon current predictions in that portion
of the Kor;h Pacific.
All the Assenib.yrnen-elect from San
Francisco and all tuo-e from adjacent
counties who are in the City will be the
quests of the Harbor Commissioners this
morning. The tug Governor Markham
has been put in order for the occasion, and
an excursion around the bay is in order.
All the points of interest will be shown
the guests and a minute examination of
the water front will be made. The need
of extending the seawall will be pointed
out and the many repairs made necessary
by the work of the toredo will be shown.
When the trip is over there is no doubt
Dm that the Assemblymen will fuliy un
derstand the needs of the water front.
At the meeting of the Harbor Commis-
S'oners yesterday the board's attorney
was instructed to draft a bill to be pre
sented to the next Legislature authorizing
the issuance of a million in bonds to com
plete the seawall. The Hydrographic
Office asked that a timeball be place i on
the tower of the ferry building similar to
the one on Telegraph Hill. The matter
was referred to the chief engineer.
Chief Engineer Ho mes has a new plan
for the next, wharf to be built. It will be
entirely of steel and concrete, on the same
kind of piles as those on which Pacific
street wharf rests and which will be used
in Folsum-street wharf. According 10 the
opinion of expert*, if Broadway wharf is
built on Mr. Holmes' lines it will be prac
tically indestructible ana will last a gen
eration. The construction will cost about
$4000 more than an ordinary wharf, but
then the saving will be great in the long
run.
The bark Big Bonanza got in from Na
na mo yesterday. The vessel had a hard
time of it, and had to put into Port An
geles for temporary repairs.
The brig Geneva, that left here some
weeks ago to loau lumber for Australia,
is evidently in a bad way. The Hum bold t
Times says:
The brig Geneva which sprung a leak at
Vance's mill last Saturday is still on the point
of Woodley Island and is nicely to remain there
several days yet. The vessel hus been lighented
alt, her rudder unshippea and the copper
stripped from the eusiiig where the lean was
supposed to be, but despite the closest exam
ination no aperture wÂ»- found that would ad
mit water into the hold. The leak did not de
velop until the vebsel had been put down in
the water between thirteen and lourteen ieet,
and that the leak is somewhere about that
mark and at the stern is all that the carpen
ters are sure of. As a last remedy for the evil
a gang of chlkers will be put to work to en Ik
all the seams in the vessel's run. Matthew
Turner of San Francisco, the builder and man
aging owner of the Geneva, has been notified
aud is expected here on the Pomona to-day.
Captain Swan of the Theobald will take
the tug Hunter out on her trial trips when
she has completed her overhauling. Next
spring he will take tbe Theobald to
Alaska aeain.
The ship Two Brothers, on her way
here from Departure Bay, had to come to
an anchor in Otter harbor for rive days,
on account or a heavy southpast gale.
The ship Invincible, Sunday last, passed
a schooner bottom-up off Point Reyes. It
was nearly dark at the time, and the cap
tain could give no more information than
the mere fact.
Mrs. Schnller's Troubles.
Mrs. Eugenia Schuller, whose marital
troub'es were referred to in yesterday's Call,
swore to a complaint in Judge Campbell's
court yesterday morning charging her hus
band, Andrew Sshuller. the broker, with
threats against her life. She has been living
apart from her husband for several weeks, and
on Christmas day, because she asked him for a
dollar to buy her dinner, she alleges, he
puliedout & revolver and threatened to kill
tier.
ZANTE GRAPES AGAIN.
The Case to Be All i ried Over In New
York.
Several months ago a decision in favor
of the Government was rendered in the
noted Zante currant or grape caae. Naval
Officer Colonel Irish attended to the de
tails of the cave, which was brought in tbe
name of the Collector oi the Port. It was
Ib determine wnether the Zante currant
was of the currant or the grape family.
If the latter, it was subject to duty, and
the duties on tbe importations amount to
a quarter of a million dollars a year. It
must bo remembered that the decision
appiies only to this division and not to
any other tJnitel States Circuit Court dis
trict. Hence the Government is likely to
lose if this question should be legally
raised in other districts.
Colonel Irish recently learned that tba
importers ot the Zante grapes have begun
proceedings in the New York district in
the hopes of proving v.at the Zante prod
uct is a currant. In order to uphold the
decision of the western Uniied States Cir
cuit Court Colonel Irish is preparing and
arranging all of the testimony presented
here. This will comprise the historical,
scientific and commercial status of the
article. This he will at once forward in
the hope that this forefgn food product
will be made to pay entry at the port of
New York as well asat San Francisco.
Contra Costa'a Exhibit.
The Contra Costa County exhibit at the
State Board of Trade rooms on Post street was
not entirely satisfactory to the Supervisors of
that county on account of its location. Hither
to it has been situated in the west Side of the
room. Yesterday, however, workmen were
busy placing in position a handsome new
stand in the center of the room, pnrily built
up of terra cotta bricks, and the exhibit will be
removed there snortiy.

C&ew Lee Kong, Ging's Brother, Tells
of the Shootingâ Finding of
the Knife.
See Yup against Sam Yup. That is a
succinct statement of the cause of the two
" recent murders in Chinatown which have
thrown the whole Chinese quarter into a
Btate of intense exciment and called for
the presence of the police in force.
Sergeant Wollweber and a squad of five
picked men did nothing at all yesterday
but wander among the haunts of the
criminal class of the Cninese and keep
their eyes open for trouble. They were
assisted by the two regular officers always
kept in that quarter.
Sergeant Wollweber worked tirelessly
on the case of Chew Ging, shot on Jackson
street, and his vigilance was rewarded by
learning enough to put him on the track
of the assassin, whom he hopes to capture
in a short time.
First, he learned that the assassin was ;
a young man and a member of the Wall !
Hing San Fong Tong, a Sam Yup high
binder society, located at 816 Jackson
street. A raid was at once made on this
place.
The police were forced to break the doors
down to gain en trance, and this gave the
occupants time to scatter and disappear.
Most of them made their escape through
a trapdoor in the rear. When Wollweber
and his men entered the only sign of life
visible was a solitary heathen lying on the
floor very ill.
In their hasty flight the hatchetmen
dropped a large kn.fe, which the police
secarea. It has a blade twelve inches
long and was whetted as sharp as a razor.
On an inner door was posted a small
script in Chinese hieroglyphics, giving in
disputable evidence of the character of the j
meeting. It was also taken.
Sergeant Wollweber also discovered that
Chew Ging had a brother at 724 Commer
cial street, and in company with a Call
representative and artist he railed upon |
him. His name is Chew Lee Kong.
Though badly frightened by what has j
occurred, Kong related very clearly tbe j
manner in w.iich Ging was murdered and j
what he believed was the cause. Accord- |
ing to his story the assassination was a j
direct result of a gambling fracas.
"Several nights ago," said Kong, "my
brother was engaged in gambling at the
Oriental-Pacific Club on Jackson street,
right acioss from where he was shot. Day
before yesterday one of the participants
met him on the street and jostled him,
but he avoided trouble by walking away.
"Then about 12:30 o'clock yesterday
morning he was passing that little fruit
stora kept by an cged friend at the en
trance to St. Louis piace. Tbe old man
a?ked him to help pull down an awning,
and while he was doing this three men
came across to where be was engaged.
â¢â¢ThÂ»y said not a word, but one sud- j
denlv drew a large revolver from beneath
his blouse and handed it to one of the
others, at the same time pointing out
Ging. The man took the revolver and
Bhot my brother. As be fell he stepped up
close to him and shot him three more
times.
"Tbe old fruit-dealer and several others I
saw tbe man that did the shooting and |
knew him. He is in hiding, but he can- j
not escape us. Tne Chew family is com- j
posed of four powerful branches, and ;
when once they get an eye on a man he I
is marked."
The friends of the murdered man then j
promised Wollweber that they would point j
the murderer out to tbe police on sight.
As has been mentioned, he is known to
be a member of the Wan Hiag San Fong
Tong, a Sam Yup highbinder organiza
tion. The mutdored man himself is said
to have been a member of the Bo Leong
Tong, one of the s cieties that has lately
stirred up so much trouble in the Kung j
Cbow Asylum.
Though the police believe that the gam- j
bling episode may have had something to
do with Chew Ging's selection for "the |
assassin's bullet, they are convinced that
the cause of his being killed lay in
the fact he was a See Yup. The Chinese
found hanging in tne stable at the rear of j
808 Stockton street was a Sam Yup. It!
was merely tit for tat.

An Authority Whom AH
Will Delight to Honor
Golden Gate Kindergarten Association,
MRS. SARAH B. COOPER, President,
4902 Vaixejo Street.
San Francisco, Cal., Feb. 3, 1890.
You ask me if I know anything about the Royal
Baking Powder, and if I consider it free from all
adulteration.
I am glad to be able to assure you that 1 know,
both from experience and from a chemical analysis,
that the Royal Baking Powder is a pure, whole-
some and dependable article.
Knowing the pernicious effects of deleterious in-
gredients used in the preparation of food, especially
in that indispensable article to every family â bread
â I have taken great pains to ascertain what I could
safely use in my own home, and recommend to the
many mothers with whom I constantly come in con-
tact in our work among the children, I regard the
Royal Baking Powder as a boon to the household
and a benediction to the race.
Very sincerely yoats,
the case of the latter. He i* now thought
to have b2en a clerk named Ho Low, em
ployed in Bo Lem's drugstore.
The theory of suicide has been advanced
in this case, but owing to the circum
stances this hypothesis is generally
scouted.
An autopsy performed on the body of
Chew Ging by Dr. Morgan yesterday re
vealed that he had been struck by four
builets. One passed through the body
near the abdomen, another plowed its
way through the muscles of the right
thigti, a third broke the right arm and the
last entered under the right arm and
passed from the body under the left
shoulder blade.
In the case of How Low it was found
that he had not been stabbed prior to
hanging, but shot. The ball entered un
der tbe right ear, glanced on the jaw bone
and was deflected from its course. It
lodged in the spinal column and must
have caused instant death.
Late last night Too King, Ah Soy and
Tom Fooey were arrested on suspicion of
being concerned in the murder.
A CHRISTMAS CANTATA.
Played by Children of the First Pres
byterian Sundny-school Last Night.
An audience of more than 500 assembled
in Union Square Hall last night to hear
tbe children and adult members of the
First Presbyterian Church Sunday-school
and choir produce a Christmas cantata en
titled "bt. Nicholas' Visit to the School."
The performance, both from a musical
and a histrionic point of view, was excel-
lent. The Sunday-school orchestra, com
posed of forty-five pieces, played admira
| bly under the direction of Otto Fleissner,
i to whose skill in that capacity it bore the
best kind of testimony.
lhe whole of the choral mnsic, which
j forms a large portion of the cantata, was
: very prettiiv- rendered by the children,
' who, attired in brieht costumes, pre
i sented a charming appearance. Bert
i Waterman and Fred L. Shaw, who imper-
I sonated Long Ago and St. Nicholas re
| spectively. were cleverly "made up" and
! acted well. Th* following roloists ac
i quitted themseives in a highly satisfactory
j manner: Miss Maud Purdy, Misses Jessie
and Daisy Slocombe. Miss Sophift Sievers,
Mr. Nathan Frisbie, Miss Maud Gray. Dr.
Gilbert Graham, Mrs. Don P. Riggs, Mrs.
Sedgley ReynoHs, Earl Suthard, Helene

CRUELTY TO A HORSE.
William Gavin, a Parrol-Wagon Driver,
Suspended.
William Gavin, driver of the patrol
wagon at the North End police station,
was suspended from duty yesterday atter
noon by Captain Wittraan, for cruelty to
one of the hor-es he was driving.
Sergeant Brown, who is in charge of the
station, noticed tbat one of the horses
had long welts along its sides and hips.
He spoke to Gavin about it and Gavin said
the horse had bitten him and be bad
lashed it with his whip. The treatment
was so brutal that the sergeant made
Gavin drive to the Central station and
Captain Wittman was notified. The cap
tain was so incensed when he saw the
condition of the animal that he promptly
suspended him and placed the team in
charge of one of the policemen.
A formal complaint against Gavin will
be made before the Boar^d of Supervisors.
Minor Spaldinjj Heirs.

9, at Central Park. The game will be for
charity.
Combining young and athletic army
and navy officers , with young, athletic
and well-to-do alumni of many different
colleges, the contest will naturally be as
much of a society event as an exhibition
of football. The cause of charity and the
extensive social acquaintance of the par
ticipants in the game will undoubtedly
result in a fashionable assemblage among
the spectators.
Following are the officers and young
University clubmen that will play and
the positions they will occupy : :f \

Neither team is yet complete, though
eacn has considerable material from
which to choose men for the places now
unfilled. Tbe men have began practice
already.
The army and navy officers, who are to
play under the team name of Bohemians,
have toe advantage in possessing some
football material of marked ability and
fresh from the West Point and Annapolis
teams.
There is Ames, who was center on the
West Point team last season end who has
played center for the Olympics this season.
His admirers consider him the best center
on the coast, and he is certainly only sur
passed by Williams, the all-round Stan
ford center.
And there is Nolan, who will captain
the team. He was end at West Point last
season and ranked as one of the best two
ends in the countiy in 1895. This season
his surprising work on the Olympic team
has easily marked him as the best end on
this coast. McCormack, too, is a star.
He was captain and end at the Annapolis
Naval Academy last year, and this season
he has frequently shown his skill in games
ht-re as end on the Olympic team, his
latest good work having been that against
Butte on Christmas. Cavanaugh and
Karns were members of last season's
Annapolis team. But the promising new
addition to the army and navy aggregation
is King, the West Point fuilbacs of last
season, who is expected out here in time
for the game.
The University Club eleven will be
captained by Fred McNear, who used to
be sub-hallback at Harvard several years
ago, and who, during the two seasons past,
played occasionally with the Olympic
team. Joe Tobin, who used to be a regular
standby until he got married, will play
fullback and do the kicking. And at that
he is good. Several years ago in a game
between Olympic and Stanford, Tobin
saved Olympic from a whitewash Dy a
beautiful field-goal kicked from the thirty
live-yard line at a moment when several
Stanford rushers were nil but upon him. '
As cool as a veteran, he adroitly .stepped
to one side, dropped the ball, and just as
it rebounded caught it with his toe, send
ing it sailing high over the field and
exactly between tbe goal posts for rive
points, and every one applauded. That
Held goal is the only one recorded in the
history of club and collegiate football
games on this coast.
TO WELCOME THE LIGHT.
Planning: a Big Celebration by the
Fourth-Street Improvement Club.
The Fourth-street Improvement Club
will celebrate the electric lighting on that
thoroughfare New Year's eve, on which
occasion the district lying between Market
and Folsom streets will be brightly illu
minated with electric lights. The exer
cises will consist of an elaborate display
of fireworks, and the services of numerous
bauds have been engaged to assist in the
celebration, in which the public is earn
estly invited to participate.
The committee having the affair in
charge is sparing no pains and expense
toward making the affair a grand success,
and in order to make this a memorable
occasion tbe storekeepers on Fourth street,
between Market and Folsom, are respect
fully requested to co-operate to the best of
their ability in the manner of decorating
their respective establishments with
Chinese lanterns, flags, etc. on Thursday
evening.
The executive committee, J. P. Sullivan,
William King and Joseph Strauss, will
bold a meeting to-night to complete addi
tional details, such as securing additional
liebts, bituminous pavements, etc.
The following merchants will distribute
the designated prizes free to the public:
J. T. Sullivan, 18 Fourth street, one pair
men's shoes and one pair ladies' shoes;
California Hat Works, 111 Fourth street,

ents to be given away.
The Letter-Box Thief.
Several weeks ago Simon Bendit was caueht
stealing from the letter-boxes of merchants
on Battery street, but tne evidence was not
sufficient to convict him. He was re-arrested
for stealing a package of gloves mailed from
the north to a dealer at 14 Butter street.
Yesterday afternoon the Grand Jury took up
Bendit's case and found an indictment against
him for stealing a package from a United
States letter-box.
A BUTCHER WHO
INVITED A PENALTY
Morris Scheuer Offered
Diseased Meat for
Sale.
Judge Low Inflicts the Full
Penalty of Six Months
in Jail.
Meat Inspector Davis Believes the
Action of the Judge Will Have
B neficial Effect.
Judge Low showed a worthy example
to tbe other Judges yesterday when he
imposed tbe full penalty of six months in
the County Jail upon Morris Scbeuer, a
butcher, for offering for sale diseased
meat.
Scheuer's case was an aggravated one
and tbe evidence showed that he had been
guilty of a gross violation of the law.
On December 15 A. Pariez of the San
Pablo dairy, near Fifteenth avenue, killed
a cow that was suffering from milk fever.
He gave the carcass to Scheuer to take to
the fertilizing works, but instead Scheuer
took it to J. S. James* slaughter-house,
where it was skinned and hung up for
sale.
Meat Inspector Ben Davis discovered
the carcass and at once condemned the
meat, as it was diseased and unfit for
consumption, and he thought that would
put an end to the matter.
Next day Scbeuer called upon Davis and
begged him not to condemn the meat, as
it was all right. He said he had paid $30
for the cow to Pariez, as it bad broken its
leg and had to be slaughtered, and it
would be a dead loss to him if the meat
was condemned. Davis told him that the
meat was diseased, and he did not care
whether Scheuer paid $30 or $1000 for the
cow, it was not fit for use.
Davis drove to Pariez's ranch and ascer
tained tbat Pariez had killed the cow be
cause it was diseased, and tbat Scueucr
did not give nim a cent for the carcass.
Tbe cow's leg was not broken, and it was
suspected that Scheuer had broken the leg
himself to avert suspicion from the real
cause of the cow being killed.
Pariez promised to appear in court to
testify to these facts, and Davis imme
diately swore out a complaint against
Scheuer and arrested him for offering dis
eased meat for sale.
The evidence was so convincing that the
Judge intimated he would inflict the full
est penalty. Scheuer pleaded hard to be
allowed to pay a line, and brought every
possible influence to bear in his behalf,
but the Judge would not listen to the sug
gestion of a compromise and sentenced
him to six months in tbe County Jail.
Scheuer gave notice of appeal and the
JucUe fixed his bonds in $1000.
"I am glad that Judge Low inflicted
the severest penalty," said Ins-ppctor
Davis, "and if the other Judges would fol
low his example instead of inflicting a fine
of $5 or $10 I would soon guarantee that
the citizens would be supplied with good
meat."

CROATIANS AND
THE Y. M. I.
New Strossmayer Council
Instituted Last
Night.
It Is Named After the Famous
Bishop Strossmayer of
Croatia.
Rev. Father Crowley Outlines the
Life of That Prelate and
Philanthropist
The Young Men's Institute received an
other important addition last night in the
shape of Strossmayer Council, which as its
name suggests is somewhat unique in
character.
The new council will be composed of
natives of Croatia, a province of the Aus
tro-Hungarian empire, or of those who
can claim descent from Croatian ancestors,
This new departure is abundantly justi
fied by the fact that in San Francisco
alone there are more than 6000 Croatians,
t iie large majority of whom are members
of the Roman Catholic Church.
The council is named after the famous
Slavic prelate, Bishop Strossmayer, who
has so long been identified with a national
and patriotic movement to win by peace
ful methods autonomy or home rule for
Croatia while still retaining that province
as an integral part of the Austro-Hunga
rian federation.
Strossmayer Council starts with a
charter membership of fifty, and was
formally instituted last night in the El
Dorado Hall, Alcazar building, by the
grand deputy organizer, Richard Dowdal,
who also installed the following officers:
President, L. W. Piskulich; first vice
president, A. Pilcovich; second vice-presi
dent, M. Tutirh; recording s-crs'ary, T.
Jerech; financial secretary, V. Zimich;
treasurer, V. Mirko; conductor, John
Francovich; trustees, N. Megica, M.
Keico, 1. Violich and A. Zitkovicb.
Routine business having been con
cluded, Rev. Father Crowley delivered
an eloquent and timely address on the
subject of the council's famous namesake.
Bishop Strossmayer, he said, was a leader
among hi 3 people, who numbered nine
millions. In 1849 he abandoned the luxury
and splendor of the Austrian court in or
der to devote his life entirely to the eleva
tion of his race. When he thus returned
to his native land he found there a de
plorable state of things. Of the numerous
schools which had been established in
Croatia not one included the language of
that country in its curriculum. The
Bishop's first work was to remedy this
deficiency.
Since then he had founded the Uni
versity of Agram at a cost of over $2,000,
-000, an institution which had proved an
inestimable blessing to tbe people. He
also established a great printing-house,
from which the literature and folklore of
Croatia were continually disseminated.
His third great work was the erection of
a tine cathedral costing five million francs
at Diacovo, the seat of the bishopric, and
he gave further evidence of his devotion
to his philanthropic and patriotic mission
by refusing the offor of a Cardinal's hat.
The Croatians, Father Crowley stated,
are trying to regain their national auton
omy, and hope to accomplish this object
while still remaining subject to the
Austro-Hungarian empire. For ages in
tellectual and social progress has been re
tarded in Croatia by the dangerous position
of tbat country as an armed barrier be
tween the TurK and the rest of Europe,
and to the heroic efforts of its soldiers
above any other single factor in modern
history the repulse of the Mohammedan
power is to be attributed. Apropos of his
subject Father Crowiey said:
"One of the most distinctive indications
of slavery is tbe loss of a nation's
language. And a nation is never entirely
enslaved until its language â the greatest
tie that binds it togetherâ is entirely
lost." ___Â«______^_

she known that her every movement was
watched by Harry Morse's detectives her
demeanor might have chanced.
Although the detectives watched her
they did not notice any suspicious actions
on ncr part until ehe reached the crockery
room. Here, after glancing about her, she
endeavored to slip a china teatray into
her bag. It caught at the opening and
she became flurried.
Before she could again assume her
usually calm demeanor the detectives,
walked up and placed her under arrest.
At this culmination she lost her courage
and became hysterical. She begged and
implored to be released. "I am a respect
able woman and have two married
daughters in this City," she said between
her sobs. Her pleadings were useless, how
ever, and she was removed to the South
ern police station, where a charge of shop
lifting was placed against her.
Mrs. Roue. 628 Geary street, she stated,
were her name and address, but it is not
known whether or not they are correct.
When the bag she carried wae searched
at the station a bolt of lavender ribbon,
two small Bibles, one large book and
Christmas volume and a small but valu
able statuette were found.
This conclusively shows tbat at least
one article was taken from each depart
ment visited, right froa under the de
tectives' eyes, and the woman escaped
detection until the large tfay caught in
tbe bag opening.
Kleptomania, tbe detectives say, can
hardly be offered as an excuse for the pris
oner's crime. She carried a bag in which
to secrete her surreptitiously gotten coods,
and this fact, taken in connection with her
cleverness and systematic mode of pro
cedure, give? the case a professional as
pect. The accused woman was a irequent
visitor to the Emporium.
Car Accidents.
P. A. Cadogan fell off a car at McAllister and
Fillmore streets last night and had his lace
and head brnised. D. S. Voorhies, an old man
living at 281 Minna street, stepped off a Cas
tro-street car last night at Market and Gough
streets, and was knocked down by a car going
in tne opposite direction. He escaped with
slight bruises.
