ST. PAUL, Minn., Oct. 11.â In recly to
a letter of business men of the Catholic
chu rcbes of this city, Archbishop Ireland
to-night gave out a letter itÂ» which he
gives nis reasons why he is opposed to the
Chicago platform. The letter of his con
stituents is an appeal for light upon the
duties of the hour and asks for the Arch
bishop's calm and honest convictions on
the issues of the day. The following is
the reply:
Messrs. Gordon, Dawion, Warner, Etc.âGen
tlemen: I am not unwilling, in the crisis
through which the country is now passing, to
speak, tor the integrity of the Nation, fur the
prosperity of the people, for tne honor of
America and the permanency of free institu
tions.
I am a citizen of the country, concerned in
all the interest* of the Nation, subject to all
the responsibilities of citizenship. To be silent
when words of mine may be of some profit to
the people would be cowardice, would be
crime. lam not unmindful of the objection
made against the churchman speaking at any
time on matters which have entered the arena
of politics, lest his influence as a teacher o:
religion seem to be used to promote the in
terests of a political party. I might reply that
there are occasions when a political platform
means disaster to the country, when politics
are closely connected with morals ana relieiou,
and that on those occasions the churchman
must be the patriot, without allowing a mo
ment's thought to considerations of expe
diency, and must take in hand the moral or
religious issue, even if it be vested in the gar
ment of politics.
But, in the present instance, I seek no ex
cuse of this kind; I speak entirely as the citi
zen without warrant from my ecclesiastical
position. Deep as my convictions are, I hold
in all due respect my fellow-citizens who hold
convictions at variance with my own. I im
peach neither their good faith, nor their
honor. I em dealing not with men, bat with
Pfiuciplesand movements. This justice which
I render to those whose ideas I am ready to
combat, 1 am sure they will render to me.
I stand by the platform and tne present can
didate of the Republican conversion of St
Louis. lam opposed to the platform and the
Presidential candidate of the Democratic con
vention at Chicago. The days of civil war ex
cepted, at no time did so great a peril threaten
the country as that which is involved in the
political campaign of to-day.
The question of free and unlimited coinage
of silver is put in the foreground. The ques
tion has its importance, but it is of a minor
Importance in the presence of other questions,
which are brought into the movement, which
had its expression in the Chicago convention
and which now seeks, by means of popular
suffrage, to en rhron.e itself in the capital of
the Nation; it is in its right logical effects,
revolution against the United States;
it is secessionâ the sece ; sion of 1861
which our s-oldiers believed they had con
signed to eternal death at Appomattox, but
which demunds again recognition from the
American people. Tne declaration in the
Chicago platform has, and can have, no other
meaning: "We denounce arbitrary Interfer
ence by Federal authorities in local affairs as
a violation of the Constitution of the United
States and a crime against free institutions."
The words point to the act of Grover Cleve
land sending United States troops to protect
National property and enforce National laws
during the Chicago riots in 1894. In those
words there is the old secession doctrine that
States are independent of the National Gov
ernment at Washington. There is the annul
ment of the Union; there is notice served upon
the fla? of America tnat outs de the District
of Columbia it is without power of self-asser
tion or se.f-defense. The President of the
United States is to;d that to enforce National
laws and protect National property he cannot
march his troops into any State without the
authorization of the Governor of that State
One of the chief speakers at the convention at
Chicago understood the significance of the
convention and voiced its spirit
"I came from a State which was the home of
secession," said Senator Tillmen of Bomh
Carolina. "I say,' he continued, "it is a sec
tional issue and it wiil prevail." And fitting
was it that the speazer, voicing the spirit of
ARCHBISHOP IRELAND, Who as a Gtizen, and Without Warrant
From His Ecclesiastical Position, Denounces the Chicago
Platform and Declares the Doctrine of Bryan Revolutionary
and a WViace to the Nation,
The San Francisco Call
the Cfilcago convention, should bs thÃ repre
sentative of South Carolina. Thrice has South
Carolina spoken for secession â when it passed
in 1832 the nullification ordinance, when in
186 iit fired on Fort Sumter, when in 1896 it
cries ont: "A sectional issue, and it will pre
vail."
The platform of tne Chicago convention
threatens to end with destruction of social
order, with lawlessness and anarchy. The per
sonifi cation of law and of social order in
America is in our courts and the promise of
safety to our free institutions is the prompt
ooedience to those courts, and now the courts
are to be shorn of their power and shorn oi it
in favor of mobs bent on rioting and the de
struction of property.
"We especially object," says tke Chicago
platform, "to government by injunction as a
new and highly dangerous form of oppres
sion." Here reference is made to the action of
the courts during the Chicago riots, without
whien action there is no calculating how much
ruin should have come to the city. The palla
dium of American liberties is the Supreme
Court at Washington, the counterpart of which
in majesty and in power to enforce absolute
justice does not exist among the nations of
Christendom. But as far as it is possible to hu
man ingenuity, outside of partisan politics,
independent of all political influences through
their life tenure of office, the Judges of this
court rule Congress and President, State and
Nation, and expound the law in all its inflexi
bility, no matter who must yield to it.
And now a convention speaks of the Su
preme Court "as it may be hereafter consti
tuted," intimating unmistakably the inten
tion, if the party represented in that conven
tion come to power, the intention to constitute
the courts by the popular election of the
Judges, by the shortening of their term of
office, or otherwise, so as to make it insensible
to the stern voice of law and responsible to the
pissing whims of political parties. Worse to
my mind than all this is tbe spirit of social
ism that permeates the whole movement
which has issued from the convention at Chi
cago. It is the "Internationale" of Europe, now
taking body in America. Of this one cannot
but bs convinced when the movement is
closely observed, the shibooleth of its adher
ents listened to, the discourses of its orators
carefully examined. The war of class against I

class is upon as, tbe war ol tne proletariat
against the property-holder.
No other meaning than this can be given to
the "common people," to the "laborer," to
the "poor and downtrodden," and to the de
nunciations against "plutocrats" and "corpo*
rations" and "money-grabbers" and "bault"
ers."
Many adherents of the movement do not per
ceive Its full meaning. But let them beware;
they are lighting torches which, borne in the
ha;ids of reckless men, may light up in this
country the lurid fires of a Commune. Amer
ica heretofore has been free from socialistic
hatred and warfare; it has been a country of
opportunities for all men, and it has given to
the laborers a livelihood higher and better
than is afforded him in any other country in
the worid. Is this all to be changed? Is social
chaos, gloating over ruins, to be a method of
the social elevation of the masses ? There may
be room in some things for peaceful ameliora
tion through well-informed public opinion
and orderly legislation; but class hatred and
vu t . ; passion never led to anything but gen
eral misery and suffering.
The people of America must to-day look
warily around, guard against catch words and
misleading war cries, avoid giving any coun
tenance to socialistic or anarchistic tenden
cies and know that the first condition of pros
perity to any and all classes of the people is a
peaceful commonwealth and assured social or
der. The monetary question, indeed, is only
a secondary issue in the campaign. I have,
however, my convictions in this matter. The
free and unlimited coinage of silver dollars at
a ratio of 16 to 1 by the United States, inde
pendently of other great commercial nations,

will disturb the whole business of the coun
try and bring upon it a financial depression
far beyond anything which we are now expe
riencing. lam confronted with the pamphlet
of Archbishop Walsh of Dublin on "Bimetal
lism," as a reply to my objection to the silver
resolution of the Chicago convention. The
pamphlet of Archbishop Walsh has no bearing
whatever on the situation in America.
The ArchDishop discusses bimetallism ver
sus monometallism, and that only from one
point of viewâ the effect of monometallism
upon the farmers' contracts under the land
purchase acts in Ireland. He expresses no
opinion as to the ratio at which silver is to be
coined and he manifestly presupposes that bi
metallism would be brought about by an in
ternational agreement. He alleges that India
was unable to keep a silver currency inde
pendently it European nations. "It was im
possible for India to obtain the loans that are
absolutely necessary for the development of
the country" and the reason was ''the fluctua
tions in the relative value of the rupee.'
--"It is the Â«ilver currency of China," he adds,
"that stops the making of railways in tiat
country." Walsh's pamphlet is throughout a
solid argument against the Chicago platform.
To what he says he might add that France and
all the countries ol the Latin Union to-day
were ultimately compelled to give up bimet
allism, so long as other countries of Europe
would not.co-operate with them.
The question before the people of America
to-day is the coinage of silver by this country,
independently of great commercial nations of
the world, at the ratio of 16 to 1. This ratio
is the double of the present commercial value
of silver. The consequences of unlimited
coinage in these circumstances are easily
proved. The only hope of the Silver party is
"that under free co.nage we will raise the
value of silver to $1 29 an ounce, measured in
gold."
On what authority is this said? On that of
the mere â word of the men that make the as
sertion. The experience of our own country
contradicts the assertion. The purchasing of
$50,000,000 worth of bullion (under the Sher
man act) was not Able to prevent the fall in the
value of silver from over a dollar an ounce to
its present low value. The experience of
France contradicts the assertion. France,
with all the countries of the Latin Union, had
to give up the coinage of silver, lest, over
loaded with the silver of the world, it should
lose all its gold. Common-sense is against the
assertion.
Silver is now produced in such quantities at
such small expense of production that its
va.ue cannot be kept up to its former stand
ard. And is the whole business of America to
be imperiled by a leap into an experiment
which those very men who advocate it confess
to be only an experiment, and which experi
e nee and common-sense condemn T
i The boast that the United States is able all
I alone to whip England and the rest of the
! world into the coinage of silver B>i 16 to 1, or
i to force the value of silver up to $1 29 an
I ounce, Is mere nonsense. We are a great peo
ple indeed, but we have not yet grown to that
commercial strength that our country means
the commercial world. Our National pride
| may give us extraordinary dreams of our mr
portance, but it will not do to build the busi
ness of the country upon those dreams.
Would all the commercial nations together,
coining silver at 16 to 1, bring up the value of
silver bullion to $1 29 per ounce? Perhaps.
Strong commercial reasons suggest the con
trary. Would America alone bring silver to
$129? Assuredly not; although, of course,
the new demand for silver from the mints
would give some increase to its value, which
increase, however, might again be offset by an
increase of production.
Some imagine that the ratio of stiver to gold
was always 16 to 1, or thereabouts. The ratio
was constantly changing throughout historic
times. At one time silver was more valuable
than gold; at another time, since the discov
ery of America, silver was ten times less valu
nble than gold. The rntlo is constantly chang
ing, and the question for us to-day is not what
the ratio was at a preceding date, but what It
should be in our time.
But has not Herr Bismarck counseled the
United States to ro ahead and make the ex
periment all alone? Yes; and some Ameri
cans quote his words as authority. The sly
old fox would, indeed, be pleased to see Amer
ica make tbe experiment and go to the bottom
of the sea. Free co nage then will give us
money worth in the commercial market of the
world a little over half its nominal value. No
one Imagines that the stamp of the Govern
ment gives value to a piece of metal; It merely
certifies to the qrality and quantity. Other
wise the Government stamp might as well be
affixed to copper or mere paper. If the Gov
ernment stamp gave value the debased coin
issued in the past by impecunious sovereigns it
would not have ruined the subjects of those
sovereigns, and the assignats of France and
tbe paper issued by Ferdinand of Naples a cen
tury ago would not have sold in the market al
most as Government rags.
Legal tender, compelling man to accept
against theii will money above its commer
cial value in the markets of the world, is rank
injustice. The eÂ«r.y financial statesmen of
Americaâ Jefferson, Morris, Hamiltonâ never
thought of making the legal value of coin
higner thati the commercial value of tha
metal out of which the coins were made.
Therefore, with the passage ot free coinage,
we shall have a currency rejected at its nom
inal value in the commercial markets of the
world, unstable and fluctuating iv real value.
Business cannot prosper with such a currency.
The first condition of life of business is sta
bility of currency. No one will invest money
of a certain value to-day in commerce and
industry if by the time the raw material has
been turned into marketable wares the cur
rency is likely to have changed in value.
Business in all branches would become a
speculationâ a gambleâ and conservative capi
tal would keep out of sight. No loans would
be made. It is nonsense to say that capital i
must put itself into the American market
whether tno capital be American or European.
We should uot be deluded by words. We may
clamor in vain for capital. It will not come
to us unless there be security for it. It will
remain in the vaults of safety or go to other '
parts of the world where reward is small but
certain. And without capital there would te
no enterprises and no work for the people.
lam absolutely convinced that the laboring ,
classes will suffer the most of all from free ,
silver coinage. And yet the laboring classes
are those thai are tbe most urgently appealed
to in this free silver movement. A man who
talks against free silver is put down at once as
an enemy of the "common people." i
Well, for my part, 1 am willing to be called
an enemy of the working classes, of "thecom
mon people," if I am in reality advising them
for their Rood and serving their true inter-"'
ests. Those above all others in the land who \
should to-day be on their guard against the
silver movement are the laborers of America.
But wiil not the farmers be benefited ? Will
they not receive a higher price for their prod- |
nets? Maybe a higher price, but not higher
value. Of what use is it to have a dollar, in
stead of a half dollar, if the dollar can pur

ENGLAND'S PRIMATE
CULLED TO REST
Sudden Death of the Noted
Archbishop Benson of
Canterbury.
Stricken With Apoplexy During
Divine Service in the Church
ol Hawarden.
OVERCOME IN GLADSTONE'S PEW
Career of the Scholar Who Became
the Head of the Church of
England,
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 11.â The Arch
bishop of Canterbury, Primate of all Eng
land and Metropolitan, the Right Hon.
and Most Rev. Edward White Benson,
D.D. and Privy \7ouucilor, died suddenly
to-day while attending divine service in
tbe church at Hawarden.
The Archbishop was the guest of Mr.
Gladstone, through whom he was ap
pointed to the Archbishopric of Canter
bury, and, in company with the Gladstone
family, went to the Hawarden Church this
morning. After the service had com
menced a commotion was noticed in the
Gladstone pew, and immediately there
after church attendants were seen remov
ing the Aichbishop, who, it was sup
posed, was suffering from a fit. He was
taken to the rectory and medical assist
ance was hastily summoned. The doctors
worked over him in vain, and at 11:45
o'clock he died. The physicians state that
death was caused by apoplexy. Arch
bishop Benson was 67 years of age.
The Archbishop and his wife arrived at
Hawarden Castle, Mr. Gladstone's resi
dence, Saturday evening, from the north
of Ireland, where they had been visiting.
The Archbishop appeared to be in the best
of health. He attended communion at tbe
Hawarden church at 8 o'clock this morn
ing, and then breakfasted with Mr. Glad
atone and family. Lator he attended the
morning service. The confession was pro
ceeding when he fell forward. The church
attendants removed the Archbishop to
the rectory as quickly as possible. The
Rev. Stephen Gladstone, the rector of the
church, continued the service until he re
ceived a message that the Archbishop was
dead. He then closed with the prayer for
the dead from tbe burial service. .
As tbe congregation left the church the
organist played a dead march and a muf
fled peal was rung on the bells.
Mr. Gladstone was not at the church,
th*> weather preventing. He was greatly
a stressed at the death of the Archbishop.
They had been close friends for a long
time.
Archbishop Benson was esteemed by all
sects for his moderation and broad-mind
edness. His death was announced at St.
Paul's, London, at the afternoon service.
Tbe news quickly. spread, and this even
ing there was a great assemblage at the
cathedral. The preacher highly eulogized
the dead Archbishop for his fervices to
the church, his personal uprightness of
character and lovable disposition. After
the service the organist played the "Dead
March," the congregation standing as the
solemn strains filled the edifice, the great
be!l of the cathedral meanwhile being
tolled in memory of the dead.
Dean Farrar paid an impressive tribute
to the deceased Archbisnop in Canterbury
Cathedral.
The Right Hon. and Most Rev. Edward
White Benson D.D., primate of all Eng
land and Metropolitan, was born near
Birmingham in 1829. He was educated at
King Edward's School, Birmingham, and
at Trinity College, Cambridge, of which
be was successively scholar and fellow,
and where he graduated B.A. in 1852. He
was graduated M.A. in 1855, B.D. in 1862
and D.D. in 1867, Hon. D.C.v (Oxford)
1884.
He was for some years one of the mas
ters in Rugby School and had the head
mastership of Wellington College from its
first opening down to 1872. Among many
dignities he attained were honorable chap
lain to the Queen, 1873, and chaplain in or
dinary, 1875-77. In December, 1876, he
was nominated to the newly restored bish
opric of Truro and was consecrated in 3t.
Paul's Cathedral April 25, 1877. During
his occupation of the see he began the
building of a new cathedral at Truro, of
which the outward shell has cost over
Â£100,000, much of that sum having been
gathered through 'fche energy of the
Bishop.
In December. 1882, Dr. Benson was ap
pointed by the crown, on Mr. Gladstone's
recommendation, to the Archbishopric of
Canterbury, in succession to Dr. Tait. Dr.
Benson has published sermons and other
works.
Dr. Benson married, in 1859, Mary,
daughter of the late Rev. William Sidg
wick of Skipton, Yorkshire. The annual
value of the see ot Canterbury is $75 000,
and the Archbishop is the patron of 195
livings. In addition to his archiepiscopal
residence at Lambeth Palace he had a seat
at Addington Park, C'royden, Surrey.

POINT LOBOS PABK TRAGEDY.
Tbe Two Men Had Sought the Sea*
shore to Ply Their Brushes in
Company.
MONTEREY, Cal., Oct. 11.â Count
Wolfgang yon Ballestrem was shot
and kilied late last night at
Point Lobos Park, about six miles
south of Monterey. Charles Abiger of
San Francisco, his intimate friend and
bosom companion, is in the Monterey jail
pending the Coroner's investigation at 10
o'clock to-morrow and will doubtless be
held to answer for the Count's death.
News of the tragedy was received by
Justice Michaelis by telephone last night-
He summoned Constable Hernandez and
they hurried to the campers' hut occupied
by the two artists. In the outer room of the
shack they found the body of the Count
lying in a pool of blood near the door to the
inner apartment. Abiger was just enter
ing the house, lantern in hand, when they
arrived. He was placed under arrest and
brought by Constable Hernandez to Mon
terey. The San Franciscan had just re
turned to the hut alter notifying people
living in the vicinity that Yon Ballestrem
had been Killed. He declared that the
shooting was accidental, his shotgun hav
ing been discharged during a friendly
scuffle.
Undertaker Thomas Olson was sum
moned from Monterey, and brought the
body of the dead nobleman to this city.
Yon Ballestrem's hands are smeared with
clay, and on the stock of tbe shotgun with
which he was shot are clay linger prints,
which bear out Abiger' s contention that
they were scuffling for possession of the
weapon when the fatal shot was fired. A
Coroner's jury will be impaneled to-day
and an inquest held in this city.
Count yon Ballestrem and Abiger have
been camping near this city for some
months, pursuing for pleasure tbe voca
tion of artists. They have seemingly
been the best of friends, and were rarei/
out of each other's company.
When seen this afternoon by a Calt,
correspondent, Abiger was very willing to
give his version of the affair.
"Yes," he said, "it is horrible. It was
purely an accident, however. I will tell
you all about it. Yesterday afternoon
about sunset I was going out hunting for
rabbits, as was my usual custom every
afternoon just before supper. Ballestrem
was making a moid of clay at the time
for his artist's work the next day, and his
hands were covered with the stuff. â¢ I said:
'Well.old fellow, I am going out to get a few
rabbits,' and calling my dog, I was about
to go into the next room to get my gnn
when Ballestrem said, 'No, you must not
go; we don't need any of your rabbits to
night. You just stay right here, and I
will cook supper pretty soon.' I said:
'No, I am going out now,' and then went
into the adjoining room, got my gun and
was walking through the rear room ngain,
when Ballestrem stepped up, seized the
gun by the stock, telling me I must not go
out. I replied that I would go anyway,
and tried to get the gun away from him.
"We had quite a friendly little scuffle,
when all of a sudden the trigger must have
caught in my coat sleeve and the weapon
was discharged. Ballestrem fell against
the wall, and all he said was:
" 'Well, it was not your fault, Carlos.'
"He then dropped to the floor dead. I
was overcome and â something I never did
before â I f6ll down on my knees and cried
like a baby for about ten minutes. 1 then
realized that I must do something if pos
sible, for perhaps my friend waÃ not dead.
I thereupon rushed out of the house and
over the fields to a Portuguese fisherman's
house, about a quarter of a mile. away. I
asked one of the family to come with me,
saying that I had killed my partner. The
Portuguese are naturally very supersti
tious, and instead of assisting me he
Blammed the door in my face. Receiving
no aid here I went as faÂ»t as possible to
John lOeitas' house and saloon, located
just at the Carmelito gate. It was a long
distance, but I ran every step of the way,
and v\ hen I reached the saloon I was all
out of breath, to say nothing of being ex
cited over the affair.
"When I reached Freitas' place I found
it closed. I knocked, and the owner came
to the door, but would not open it,
although it was then only a little after
6:30. He asked me what I wanted, and I
told him to open the door, but he refused,
saying that I could tell him from where I
was. 1 then inlormed him that I had
shot Ballestrem and wanted a horse and
buggy to go to Monterey to tell the author
ities, and, if not too late, to procure a
doctor. He told me that he wouid not go;
that he did not have any horse in the
barn, but for me to go to Braz 1, another
rancher on Point Lobos reservation, and
maybe Brazil would go.
"I was on my way to Brazil' s place when
the first party 1 went to s?e met me and
said they were on their wav to town then
and would teli. I went buck home, but
could not summon courage to enter the
room where poor Ballestrem lay. So I lit
my lantern and walked around and around
the hou^e with my faithful dog as a com
panion. You see, he is still with me. Hav
ing lost my other Bohemian friend, my
dog is all that is left, and, as you see, he is
here with me, too."
To numerous questions put to Abiger as
to the wine found in the room where the
tragedy occurred, he said:
"No; I never get intox cated. All Ger
mans drink, of course, but neither Bal
lestrem nor I ever got drunk, and we- most
certainly were far from it last niijht. It
was <nly a friendly scuffle, as I said be
fore, but the outcome was horrible, never
the! ess.
"I have known Count Ballestrem for2
several years, and for the last two years
we have been inseparable and constantly
together. I met him by chance at bis
studio in San Francisco about two years
ago, and we have been together ever
since. This was just after his last visit to
the old country. He was going to Ger
many again in April, and I was to accom
pany him. I Â«m not as highly educated
as Ballestrem, for he spoke seven
languages, but nevertheless we were
stanch friends. I have never heard much
about his family affairs and especially
about his parents. He was always very
averse to relating any nine about them.
"His sister he spoke of quite often, and
he would receive letters from her regu
larly. He was very devoted to his sister,
and'spoke to me frequently about her. He
was the heir to his uncle's vast estates.
His uncle, so he told me, was ex-president
of the German Reichstag, and I think was
president only last year, hut I forget. His
immediate family, however, was not
wealthy, although titled. The Count was
painting a large picture of Point Lobos,
and had it nearly finished. This he would
have taken back home with him.
"I have been in America since 1868, and
lived iv San Francisco for several years.
For two years I was engaged as head clerk
in the law offices of John Tuller in San
Francisco. I have a brother-in-law and
also an uncle who are both doctors and
who reside in Stettin, Germany, at pres
ent. This is all I know about my friend,
and ail I care to tell about myself."
Jacinto Damaral and A. Macbado, Por
tuguese hshermen, living about a quarter
of a mile from Ballestrem's house, were
tue first to hear oi the killing. According
to their story ihe tragedy occurred much
later than 8 o'clock.
"We heard a shot fired, but it was about
9 o'clock last night," they said. "We had
gone to bed and were awakened by hear
ing a shot. About a half hour alter the
report of the gun Abiger came over to our
hou-e. Damaral went to the dcor and
Abiger told him he had killed his partner
and wanted some one to come over with
him. Damaral would not go, but shut the
door. Machado finally got up and saddled
his horse, and on his wÂ«y to Cariuelito
Gate met Abiger with a lantern. He said
he was coming from Freitas' saloon, but
Freitas would not help him, and he asked
me for God's sake to go to town and get a
doctor or some one. I went down to the
Hatton ranch and telephoned into Mon
terey to Justice Michaelis and told him to
come out at once. It was about 10:30
o'clock when I telephoned to Monterey.
"I then returned and went over to the
Count's bouse, where I found Abiger and
his dog outside. I asked him wLy he did
not go inside, and he told me be did not
want to go in that house again until some
one else went tirst. 1 took hi- lantern and
went inside the house. The sight was
horrible. The Count was lying all in a
heap against one door, and everything was
mussed up as if there had been a big row.
I thought this was strange, for I had seen
a great deal of the two men since their
arrival at Point Lobos, and had never
heard a harsh word between them in the
whole five niontus they spent there. I
asked Abiger how it all happened. He
told me aÂ£out the affair but .'aid the Count
did not speak at all alter he shot h:m. I
did not stay at the house long, but went
home."
Justice Michaelis, who made the arrest,
wa& a friend of the Count and Abiger.
"I believe," said Justice Mif > haelis,"that
I knew the Count better than any one in
the neighborhood. I also knew Abiger
quite well, and am sure the killing was an
accident, pure and simple. 1 know that
neither Ballestrem nor Abiger got intoxi
cated, but I believe that last night Abiger
had too much of that sour wine in him
and att-mpted to go hunting long after
dark, to which, of course, the Count ob
jected, and a scuffle followed. It must
have been much later than 6 o'clock when
the shooting occurred, and nearer 9, from
what, the Portuguese say. The gun used
happened to be mine. The whole charge
of shot entered tbe Cc.nt's left side, just
under the arm, and went directly to the
heart. 1 don't think it was willful murder
at all, but an accident."
When a Call correspondent visited the
hut of the Bohemian Count to-day he
found pictures VÂ»f such mcc as Dunham,
Joseph Bianther, Durrant and others
tacked, up prominently on the wans in
Abiger's room. The clay that the Count
was evidently molding ut the time of the
trouble was on the kitchen floor. Ihe
whole place was more like a hermit's
abode than the home of a German noble
man.
The Count's larder was well supplied.
On the table was a large demijohn of
claret wine about half empty ana several
glasses half filled were on the table.
Among the Count's possessions many let
ters from his sister and uncle were found.
There was aiso one from his mother, writ
ten about a year ago and addressed to San
Francisco.
Count Ballestrem had been sojourning
at Point Lobos Park for the past five or
six montbs. This was bis second visit to
Monterey, the first being made about two
years ago. He th n camped ou the Pacific
Improvement Company's famous Seven
teen-mile drive and was engaged in paint
ing tne sand dunes of Monterey, the most
favored spot for the many American as
well as foreign artists who come to this
neighborhood for subjects. Some of his
paintings of these saud hills are excep
tionally fine, and were taken with him
back to the old country on the Count's
last visit home, about two years ago, im
mediately after he left Monterey. These
paintings now adorn ;he salon of his
parents in Breszlau, Siiesia.
The Count was an officer in the German
army, ranking as a lieutenant, and al
though he had been coming to America
for the last sixteen years, yet under the
German law, in order to bold his office
and also be heir to hid uncle's vast estate,
he was required to be present at certain
maneuvers of the German army at speci
fied times every two years. The Count
would attend these maneuvers, and
directly after they were over would pro
cure a leave of absence and sail ior the
United States.
He was never naturalized here, for if
that was done he could not claim bis title
or fall heir to the estate; yet it has always
been remarked that in all of his studies,
no matter how small or where located, the
American flag was the chief wall decora
tion of his apartments. Only three weecs
ago he presented to the McKinley and
Hobart Ciub of this place a large cam
paign, banner, which stretches across
Alvarado street in front of the Republican
headquarters.
Aside from this he presented many
pictures of McKinley in water colors and
paste to the prominent Republican can
didates of this county.
Count. Ballestrem was a "black sheep"
of the family, and that is the principal
reason why he came to America so otten.
Despite his shortcomings, he was devoted
to his sister, and she was the only one on
whom he could count as a regular corre
spondent. Of his family he would say
very little, especially was this so of his
mother; his uncle, also a Ballestrem,
was his best friend. From him he was
heir to the family estate. His sister was
married since his last visit home and is
now Frau yon Adeisfeldt Durlach. She
is living in Baden.
About four years ago the Couut was
married, but lived with his wife only a
little over a year, she getting a divorce on
tt c ground of failure to support. She
afterward married a man by the name of
Bachman and is now riving on Howard
street, near Tenth, in San Francisco.
About the time or soon after ihe divorce
was procured the Count met Charles Abi
ger in San Francisco and formed a warm
attachment for him. The two lived to
gether until last night, an-i were always
believed to be on the very best of terms.
Abiger was older than the Count, but was
not nearly so well educated, though com
ing from an aristocratic German family.
He came to America in 1868 from Ham
burg and has lived here ever since. His
brother-in-law, a Dr. Reny, lives in Btet
tic, as also does his uncle, Dr. Herman
Anseling. He is a nice-appearing man, of
rather low stature, biack, sparkling eyes
and black hair. He wears a Van Dyke
beard.

N. M. Meigs, a gold Democrat and ousi
ness man of Jacksonville, Fla., says he
believes that the electoral votes of Florida
can be secured for the nominees of the In
dianapolis convention if the Republicans
can be prevailed upon to withdraw their
electorul ticket and join the gold Demo
crats. He says from talks he has had
with gold Democrats and others since he
came to New York he believes that this
will be done.
Governor Griggs of New Jersey, from a
trip through Hunterdon, Sussex and
Warren counties, three of the strongest
Democratic counties in tbe State, said:
"I am confident that the Republicans will
be succersful in this contest, which, to
gether with Morris County, composes
Congressman Pitney's district. The peo
ple are enthusiastic over Pitney. New
Jersey will give at least 60,000 majority
for McKinley and Hobart, and I shall not
be surprised if the figures run beyond this
total."
Hon. B. F. Jones of Pittsbur-*, formerly
chairman of the Republican National
Committee, said : "Everything tnat I can
see and hear from reliable sources is of
the encouraging kind for Repuolican suc
cess. There is not the least doubt in my
mind about Illinois, Indiana and Nebraska
going for McKimey. The prospect is cer
tainly getting better every day."
Hon. D. D. Woodmansee of Cincinnati,
presidents the National League of Re
publicans, gave it as his opinion that the
silver craze had spent its greatest force
and is becoming less potent every day.
He slated that Ohio was safe for McKinley
by 75,000 majority.

IRELAND DECLARES
IT REVOLUTIONARY
I Continued from First Paoe.l
chase no more than the half dollar? And
why will farmers receive even nominally
a much higher price than they do now? 'Ihe
best market of the farmer for the produce is
his own country, and if his own country is
impoverished, if factories are closed, if labor
ers in cities arc penniless, the farmer will re
ceive but little for his harvest.
Men on salaries will scarcely hope to have
their salaries doubled even if nominally, and
then their salaries, tuchas they may be, will
have only half the purchasing power they
have to-day.
Those who owe debts payable, principal or
interest, In gold will receive the same 6alaries
as to-day and their salaries will have but half
the debt-paying power which they have to-day.
But those who owe debts not payable in
gold? Well, if the country Is ruined where
will they find even silver to pay their debts in
silver? The only men benefitedâ and they are
few to-day, and it is scarcely worth while to
bring around a revolution iv the country to
benefit themâ are the debtors who have to-day
gold on hand, and who by free silver coinage
will hare their store doubled in nominal value
and wiil be enabled to reduce their debts by
one-half.
And for those the question remainsâ is it
honest ? It ia a delusion to imagine that sil
ver will circulate so plentifully tnat it can bo
had easily by all and that the quantity will
make up for the lack of value. If silver bul
lion does not increase in commercial value
silver will not be produced in quantity, and
as owners of silver wili not part with it, ex
cept in exchange for commodity or labor
which they deem useful and valuable, if the
business of the country is not prosperous the
people will get very little or no profit from
mintage. But â aud here is ihe popular argu
ment in favor of free coinageâ we have bad
hard times under the gold standard. That is
true, and what is also true, that under the
silver standard we shall have much harder
times. It Is the great fallacy of ihe day to be
attributing our hard times to the gold stan
dard,
The craze for frea silver Â«s a cure for hard
times Js explicable on the same theory that a
man who has been a long time sick despite the
attentive care of expert physicians will call
for any quact who advertises to cure all the
ills of humanity. Hard times have come
through i,he severe and resistless working of
economic laws, â which go their way In spite
oi legal enactment of parliaments or con
gresses. Our hara times have come from tbe
general competition with the countries of the
whole globe into which we are. forced by
cheapness and facility of transportation, from
over production in past years, from extrava
gance during good times and from our own
social and political agitations. One of ihe
chief causes of hard times to-day is this agi
tation for a radical change in the currency of
the country. It the American people put
down by an overwhelming majority this agi
tationâbury it out of sightâ one of the chief
causes of 'hard times will be out of the way.
Other causes may remain more or less. That
of general competition with all the nations of
earth must remain. Good times, however,
may bs expected to come b>ck surely, if only
gradually. The overproduction that glutted
our markets has been used up. Capitalists
are anxious to do something with their money
âif it can be invested safely. Our wondrous
natural resources invite investments to de
velop them, and confidence restored thÂ« out
look is bright. The essential thing iscon"
dence. To-day it is confidence that is needed
more than an increase in the volume of the
currency. The volume of the currency is large
enough. To increase it fictitiously certainly
wili not help us. Ninety per cent of the busi
ness is done without currencyâ by checks and
drafts â of which tne foundation is confidence.
Those who suffer from hard timesâ and there
are manyâ must hearken to reason, silence
passion, turn away from delusive remedies
and the country will be again pat on the road
to prosperity.
I ask is It honest to try to pay debts with
half the money we received when we con
tracted them? The National and private debts
contracted upon a financial system, such as
those who loaned money, gave it at a certain
commercial value and believed, as they could
not at the time have helped doing, that tney
would receive it beck at the same commercial
value, should be paid in values of that same
financial system. That the great American
Bepublic will, as a Nation, declare to the
world that it will now make a law compelling
its creditors to be satisfied with half, or a little
of the money they loaned, goes on record in
the eyes of the world as a broken-down, bank
rupt, repudiating Nation, it li not possible to
believe. No one will say in Justification of
such a possibility that America is compelled
by National poverty to do so; then no one
should be able to Bay she thinks of doing so.
There are a hundred aspects of this question
which I do not touch upon. I merely throw
out some few thoughts which show reasons
for my present political faith, and which may
be of some benefit to others in forming their
own judgment. I may, of course, be mistaken.
But I have come to look upon the present agi
tation as the great test of universal suffrage
and popular sovereignty. Can the people de
fend public honor and the institutions of the
country at the polls as they nave done on the
field of battle? Can they be so calm ana de
liberate in their judgment, so careful to weigh
all thing! in the scale of reason and to avoid
all rash experiments that they can be trusted
with the settlement of grave social and politi
cal problems? That is the question that is be
fore us at the present moment. Ireland.

HELEN GOUGAR'S
SUNDAY SPEECH
Answers Gold Arguments
Advanced by Chicago
Preachers.
Considerable Abuse Injected Into
Her Harangue for Free
Silver.
HAD TO BKEAK INTO THE HALL
Vituperative Language That Suited
Those Who Forced an Entrance
Into the Place.
CHICAGO. 111., Oct. 11.â Mrs. Helen
Gougar oi Indiana spoke at the People's
Institute this afternoon in answer to ser
mons recently delivered by local preach
ers in advocacy of the gold standard. The
meeting was called for 2 o'clock, but at
that hour the hall was still locked, and
the trustees announced that they had
rented the hall for church purposes, and
refused to allow it to be used ior political
purposes on Sunday. The announcement,
in view of the fact that the committee in
charge of Mrs. Gougar's meeting had paid
rental charges and had a receipt for the
same, caused much excitement. Many
ladies were in the crowd crushed against
the inner doors, and they were hurried to
the rear and preparations made for testing
the question by force. Just at that mo
ment a young man in front forced the
doors, and the crowd, with a cheer, rushed
in. It was reported thai the police had
been sent for, but there was no attempt to
oust the audience.
Before beginning her address Mrs.
Gougar requested the assemblage to sing
"America," which was done with a will.
She then referred to the sacredness of the
day, and said it was time the people ob
jected to confining politics to the saloon
and the devil and took it into the church
and the home. She had so apology to
make for speaking on this great question
on the Sabbath: the preachers themselves
had set the example.
Mrs. Gougar drew a picture of an imag
inary town where no money was used, but
in its stead black and white horses, and
drew a parallel between the demonetiza
tion of silver and the "de-horse-iiation" of
the white horses by the owners of the
black animals, and the train of evils that
followed ttie sending of these black horses
out of the country and thus compelling
the payment of taxes and all other charges
in white horses at a valuation arbitrarily
fixed by the "black-horse tru3t."
Mrs. Gougar carried her parallel even to
the issue of bonds and the attacks of the
financiers and preachers upon those who
wished to "undehorseatize" the white
horses, who were termed "anarchists,"
"repudiationists," "hobos," etc. The ap
plication oi the story was readily made by
the audience and heartily applauded.
The speaker then turned her attention
to Bishop Newman and Rev. Dr. Hillis,
who had spoken from their pulpits in
lavor of the srold standard, and paid her
respects to Rev. <J. H. Wolston, a Phila
delphia Baptist preacher, who recently
wrote a letter demanding that the debts of
bis church and his own salary be paid in
gold, in the event of tne adoption of free
silver, which he stigmatized as "the
devil's dollar." The clergy, she declared,
were, as a rule, the best paid workers in
the cities, and are not in a position to
know tne wants of the poor laboring
classes; they belonged to the same class
who crucified Christ and who supported
slavery, claiming it was sanctioned by
divine injunction and precept. There is
not an argument now used by the gold
standard people, she declared, that was
not used by the advocates of Luinan
slavery.
Taking up Dr. Hillis' sermon, she de
clared that if as he claimed there could be
no such thing us a double standard, then
the gold men were the guilty innovators,
as the original money metal was silver
and was recognized by the American con
stitution as such. Forty trainloads of
people had in one day recently been taken
to Canton to "witness a porch dance."
Presidents elected by "running free rail
road trains" will not oppose legislation
favorable to corporations and trusts. Her
understanding of the "over-production"
theory of the Republicans was that "the
harder we work and the more we produce
the poorer we get." Yet statistics show
that every year 10,000 children die in iSew
York City of starvation. She said it was
a shame and disgrace to the Christian
church that any minister of the gospel
should assist tho money power in its tie
faious work, and said they were doing
more harm than their efforts lor good
could overcome ntnone; the people.
Quoting Senator Sherman, she charac
terized him as one of the three great
traitors in American history, Benedict
Arnold and Jefferson Davis being the
others, and asserted that no man could
have acquired his great wealtb while serv
ing the people in Congress at a salary of
$5000 a year and living at an expense of
110,000.
Blame, had he lived, would be con
sidered an anarchist and repudiationist of
the worst kind, and McKinley's speeches,
"before Mark Hanna took hold of the
string," showed him to be one of ihe lead
ing reDudiationists of the world. In
tnswer to a suggestion that McKinley had
aeen convened, Mrs. Gougar said: "Yes,
he's been converted, because ho would
rather be President than be right."
McKinley and Cleveland were pro
nounced "financial twins"; tbe banks
were denounced for their exercise of
tyrannical power; the gold papers of Chi
cago were declared to be owned by English
syndicates and the rum power; Colonel
W. C. P. Breckinridge, candidate for Con
gress on a gold platform, was bitterly as
sailed as the "Prince of Immorality";
McKiuley was said to be supported by the
English brewers and the American whisky
ring, with whom the gold preachers had
allied themselves in his support, and the
3t Louis Convention was said to have
been marked by more drunkenness, de
bauchery and licentiousness than any
previous convention ever held in America.
Mrs. Gougar was frequently interrupted
by bursts of applause and was given quite
an ovation at the conclusion of her speecn.

phia, with plaster, came ashore at day
break this morning, in the heavy northeast
gale, below the point of Cape Henlopen,
and almost immediately went to pieces.
Three of the crew were lost and five saved.
Since yesterday a tierce northeast gale
has been blowing along the coast. The life
saving crews have been on the alert and
all last night patrolled the beach on the
lookout for vesssls in distress. In the
early dawn the schooner was seen driving
toward the beach. The life-savers hast
ened toward the spot sue was heading for,
but she struck before they came opposite
to her.
The wind is blowing a fearful gale from
the northeast to-night and the tide is
piling up on the shore. It is feared that
at high water to-night, the life-saving
stations on the shore may be swept away.
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Oct. ILâ The
northeast storm that has been traveling
along the Atlantic coast struck this city
tnis mornine, and in connection with an
extraordinary high tide has done consider
able damage. Two of the three piers along
the ocean front have sustained the greatest
damage so far. About 200 feet of the iron
pier at the loot of Massachusetts avenue
nave been battered away.
A section of the wrecked schooner Met
calfe, which was lying near the pier, was
broken by the surf and for an hour or so
it rounded with territtic force against the
piling of the pier. The piling "withstood
the battering at first, but at last the mid
dle section went down with a crash. The
mass of wood from the wreck is still float
ing along the beach front and more dam
age may be done by it.
The center of the pier at the foot cf
Texas avenue has partially given away. It
is expected thai the weakened part will go
out to sea before morning. The bulkhead
Ht Chelsea has beeh destroyed. Railroad
travel on the Camden and Atlantic Rail
road has been suspended, owing to the
high water on the meadows submerging
the tracks.
The entire force of the life-saving station
is out to-night on the beach v, atoning for
any ship in distress.
The cottages on ihÂ° meadow side of the
city have been surronded by water all day
and the ocoupants have been compelled to
use boats to get to and from their
homes. The wind reached a velocity of
fifty-miles an hour to-day. Many railroad
ties are floating in on the beach to-night
and it is believed they indicate tne wash
ing away of the trolley railroad on Brig
antine Beach.
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass., Oct. ILâ
A northeast gale oaa prevailed here to
day and it is increasing in force to-night.
The tug Mercury arrived from Boston.
No shipping disasters are reported in this
vicinity. The tugs Plymouth and N. and
W. No. 1, with barges and a small fleet of
coasters, are harbored here.
NANTUCKET, Mass.. Oct. 11.âInforma
tion of what may have been another ocean
tragedy was obtained yesterday, when
James O. McCleave picked up on the south
shore a bottle containing the following
hastily scriobled note on a leaf of a book:
September 16.
We are off Nantucket twenty miles, and are
about to sink. Please notify my wife, Mrs,
Mary Frazer of Gloucester. John C. Frazee.
We will never reacn bhore alive. Good-by.
The gale increased steadily for the past
twenty-tour hours, and is blowing a hurri
cane to-night. Small boats are being sunk
at their moorings, but shipping was so
thoroughly warned iv advance that no
other wrecks are anticipated. A small
fleet of vessels anchored off Sankety
Head last night, and made for this harbor
this morning. One three-masted schooner
is anchored in the sound near Great
Point, and is in a dangerous position.
GLOUCESTER, Mass., pet. 11.â The
schooner Alsatian, sixty-nine tons,- from
Bath, lumber-laden for Boston, capsized
off Baker Island this afternoon ana if a
total loss. The crew was saved.
SEA ISLE CITY, N. J., Oct. 11.â The
gale has raged witd great fury here to-day
and to-night. The meadows in the rear
of the city are flooded ior miles and as far
as the eye can reach, there is only a foam
ing sea.
The avenues and streets /ire inundated
by heavy breakers that are washing in all
the upper end of the city.
A ship's yawl-boat, bottom up. was seen
at sea this afternoon, which leads to the
fear that some vessel has foundered.
Many small yachts have been badly dam
aged.
LONDON, Ens., Oct. 11.â A northeast
gale is prevailing. The Danish steamer
Scotia has gone ashore at St. Abba Head,
on the east coast of Scotland. The crew
was rescued.
The schooner Caramel has foundered in
the Mersey. Six of her crew were drowned.
In many places the gale is accompanied
by snow.
A sailing vessel engaged in the coast
wise trade was wrecked to-day in Colwin
Bay, Denfcyshiro. Two of her crew were
drowned.
IN THE REALM
OF THE KAISER
Pro- Armenian Movement of
Germany Makes Little
Progress.
Czar Nicholas to Receive the Of
ficer Who Was Presented
to the Sultan.
THAT COLD FROST IN PAEIS.
Indignation Among Diplomats Who
Were Ignored in the Important
Festivities.
[Copyright, 18S6, by the United Associated Presses]
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 11.â The lull
in the excitement over affairs in the east
continues, the newspapers having decided
to await developments which are expected
to follow the departure of the Czar from
France before resuming their campaign of
agitation.
It is understood that the Czar will
shortly give an audience to General Grumb
koff, the German officer in the Ottoman
service, who is the bearer of an autograph
letter from the Sultan to the Kaiser. Gen
eral Grumbkoff is accompanied by the
Sultan's Ambassador, Ghalib Bey, who
will also be received by the Kaiser. The
niifsiou of General Grumbkoff, according
to the semi-official Berlin Post, is one of
great political importance. In the mean
time an interview with General Gruinb
tcoff appears in a Berlin paper, in
which the Turkish commissioner vig
orously defends the action of the Sultan
and the leading Turkish, officials, contend
ing that no man occupying the Turkish
throne would fulfill the demands of the
powers unconditionally. The Sultan of
Turkey, he maintains, must alway3 take
into consideration the 'probable effect of
the fulfillment of such demands upon the
Mohammedan populace, otherwise there
would be great danger of Moslem fanati
cism leading to annihilation of the Chris
tians in the empire.
"Abdul Hamid," the general says, is a
wise man and in all his actions he invari
ably looks carefully forward to the prob
able or possible result. If tue Sultan
could follow his own desires Turtey would
be a happy country, but his most excel
lent aspirations are fettered by empty pub
lic coffers. The true reform which is
needed in Turkey is financial assistance;
perhaps administered under a control
similar to the administration of Egypt, I
but as there ia no money there can be no
reform."
The pro- Armenian movement in Ger
many is making little progress. Although
the official wet blanket which has been
cast over the movement wherever it has
existed has not bad the effect to quench
the flame of agitation altogether, the
movement itself Las not been seized with
any degree of ardor by the public. Dr.
I Pepsins, the leadei of the Armenian agita
: tion, has been summoned to the Foreign
Office and requested to desist from further
activity in the matter, he being informed,
it is understood, that as the movement
was a strongly political and in no respect a
philanthropic one, the Government could
not countenance it.
The Hamburg Nachrichten, the personal
organ of Prince Bismarck, in its discus
sion of the Armenian question, argues
that the Armenians are rebels, while Ger
many and Turkey have the most friendly
relations. Therefore, the German aiders
and abettors of the Armenians are liable
to punishment under the German crim
inal code.
The circumstances of ignoring the entire
diplomatic corps at Paris in the matter of
extending invitations to the various func
tions upon the occasion of the Czar's visit
to Paris, which caused feeling of intense
indignation among the diplomats them
selves, is being much discussed in official
quarters here. At the outset of the enter
tainment or the Czar the diplomatic body
only received invitations to the gala opera
penormance, and were not asked to be
present on the occasion of the Czar's entry
into the city or attend the luncheon at the
Russian embassy, the religious ceremony
at the Russian church, the banquet at the
Palace of the Elysee, the laying of the
foundation-stone of the bridge Alexander
111, which was really the beginning of the
preparations for the exhibition to oe held
in Paris in 1900, the visit of the Czar to
Versailles or the penormance at the Come
die Francaise.
After all, or nearly all, of these func
tions were over, the diplomats received
invitations to attend the grand military
review at Chalons, and the attaches of the
various embassies and legations only ob
tained these in consequence of the remon
strance made by Count yon Munster, the
German Ernbassador, to the Foreign Office.
It is possible that the officials of the
Foreign Office did not relish the quarter
from which (he demand for invitations to
attend the great military spectacle of the
review of the French troops came, for
they promptly disclaimed any responsi
bility for the omission to send invitations,
and referred the Embas-ador to the Elysee
Palace, from which quarter the invitations
eventually emanated.
According to a special dispatch to the
Cologne Gazette from St. Petersburg,
President Faure will not pay a visit to the
Russian capital as has been suggested, but
Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria will
return the Czar's visit to Vienna, and the
Emperor and Empress of Germany may
also visit St. Petersburg concurrently with
the Austrian Kaiser unless the unexpected
accouchement of the Czarina should com
pel a postponement of the Imperial visit.
The German Colonial Council will hold
a meeting on October 19. The programme
of the meeting embraces discussion of the
colonial budget and the questions oJ slav
ery and slave trading, the military obliga
tions of settlers in Southwest Africa, the
training of colonial officials ana the mat
ter of penal procedure regarding natives.
In addition to the discussion of these
questions the recent events at Zanzibar,
including the matter of the removal from
Zanzibar of the usurping Sultan Said
Kbaiib by a German warship will doubt
less receive the attention of the meeting.
The more extreme members of the Colo
nial Council regard the removal of Said
Khalib to Dares-Salam as an important

the duty of considering the emigration
question are agreed upon the principle of
ihe establishment of a special office form
ing a sort of board oi emigration. The
matter of emigration is now normally un
der the supervision of the Home Office,
which lacks tbe means of properly dealing
with the question. One of the func
tions of the new board will be to ciirect

In plain language, this will be to divert

Son.
Its Hiding Place Revealed in

FINDS THE GOLD IN FLOKIDA.
Eccentricities of the Departed Mother
Counteracted by a Mystic
Force.
PORTLAND, Ok.. Oct. 11.â The story of
a marvelous verification of a recent dream
was vouched for to-day by Edward Simon
ton, late of Indianapolis, now visiting
friends on Portland Heights. About a
year ago he accompanied his invalid
mother to Southern Calitornia. where she
died live months ago. Mrs. Simonton was
rated as quite wealthy and the possessor
of some $40,000 in money and Government
bonds; but after her demise it was learned
that a short time prior to her coming West
she secretly disposed of her realty posses
sions in Indianapolis for $22,000 in cash.
Her son, the only heir, could not dis
cover where this money was deposited.
Mrs. Simonton transacted business with
one bank only during her many years'
residence in Indianapolis, and there was
but $230 to her credit there at the time of
her death. She died intestate and Mr.
Simonton was in sore straits to discover
what had become of his mother's fortune.
She had been erratic at times during the
two years preceding her death, bat not
sufficiently so as to arouse a suspicion that
she would place her estate beyond the
reach of her heirs. Immediately after
the old lady's death the son returned to
Indianapolis to personally investigate the
matter.
"I was almost distracted over the loss of
this large sum of money and securities,
which I knew to be somewhere," remarked
Mr. Simonton, "and in August last I, ab
stractedly and without purpose, returned
to San Francisco. The nervous strain re
sultant from this distressing affair robbed
me of my will power, and for some week?
I acted simply on the impulse of the
moment. The latter part of that month I
came to Portland to see the friends I now
am visiting. One night, remaining down
town after the Heights cars ceased runing,l
took a room at the Hotel Portland, and
that was the pivotal point of my luck.
That night I dreamed I saw my mother
alive, counting money she was taking out
of a trunk in the attic of a cottage on the
outer edge of Jacksonville, Fla.
"The cottage I saw in m\ dream was one
mother leased for five years in 1892, and
there she and I passed the winters prior
to going to Calilornia. I distinctly re
member that, when we last were there,
mother left a trunk in the attic, telling
'Mammy,' our old colored servant, not to
disturb it until she returned.
"I was in just such a nervous state as to
be so deeply impressed with that dream
that I was prompted to verify it without
delay if possible. I left here on the 10th
of last September, reaching Jacksonville
nine days later.
"In the attic was the old, battered sole
leather trunk 1 saw in my dream. It was
filled with old dre*ses, but at the bottom
of it lay a small oilskin sack, the contents
of which have made me a firm believer in
dreams. In that sack I found my moth
er's fortune, all in bonds and currency,
amounting to $58,200; but there waÂ« not a
scratch of a pen in explanation of this ec
centric freak."
Mr. Simonton added that the discovery
of this money under such seemingly ab
normal conditions proved a greater nerv
ous shock to him than had its apparent
loss. His present visit here is upon the
advice of a physician, Dr. W. S. Stuart of
Indianapolis, who is looking after the
young man's impaired nervous system.
The doctor, as well as Mr. Simonton's
Portland friends, vouch for the absolute
truthfulness of his story.

LEAGUE WORK
IN CALIFORNIA
New System as a Potect
Factor for Republican
Success.
Aggressive Campaign Directed
From the Los Angeles
Headquarters.
CLUBS IN EViRY DISTEICT.
Instructive Literature Distributed
Among the Voters Throughout
the State.
Los AifQELBS Office or The Call,}
328 South Broadway, >
Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. 7.)
The present campaign is the first in the
history of the State to witness the opera
tion of the league-club system as a potent
factor in the Republican executive lorces
working for party harmony and success.
With the State Central Committee's
headquarters at San Francisco and the
Officers of the California State League of Republican Gubs*
State League in this City there is no
reason why the party should not be put
ting a winning right in every town and
precinct throughout the Btate.
The National League plan has been in
active operation for many years In all the
Eastern States, and the late convention of
Republican clubs at Milwaukee was one of
the most important political gatherings of
the year. It was this organization which
brouebt General Clarkson, Henry Clay
Jvansand many other Republican leaders
to the front and the younger element of
the party to see in it a means of making
themselves a tower of strength in the con
test for the supremacy of Republican
principles.
The Republican party of California, in
convention at Sacramento on February 5.
1896. paid the following tribute to the
value of permanently organized clubs:
We â  indorse the work of the National
League and the efforts of the young men
of our party to make a vigorous and success
ful campaign in this State.
The officers rÂ»f the California organiza
tion have successfully started league or
ganizations in the seven Congressional
districts of the State. These district
leagues have in turn organized many
county leagues. Where it was found im
practicable to organize county leagnes
local clubs have been formed. Los An
geles, Alameda, Sacramento and Santa
Clara counties have large and prosperous
county leagues or federations. These
county organizations have proven very
effective in many ways, but especially in
making plans for public meetings and
entertaining the speakers of the party.
There are about 700 Republican clubs in
the State, many of them uniformed and
with their ownv drum corps. Never be
fore in the history of California has there
been such an interest displayed in club
work. Speakers are being sent out by the
score, and .thousands of copies of sound
money documents are being put into the
hands of the voters of the State. .
The National Republican Committee
has recognized the splendid services of the
National League, has cieated a club de
partment and placed the National secre
tary, Colonel M. J. Dowling, in charge.
In this State the central committee has
done everything possible for the advance
ment and efficiency of the State League,
and the relations between the two organi
zations have always been most cordial.
The headquarters of ttie California State
League is located in the Stowell block, on
South Spring street, in this city. Here are
the offices, the mailing depart men t, library
and storage rooms for campaign literature.
Here, packed in neat bundles, are nearly
a quarter of a million documents treating
of the money and tariff issues, in three or
four languages. The State League acts as
distributor for the National League, the
matter being of the highest order. About
100,000 documents bave .been circulated up
to date, besides several thousand posters,
stickers and campaign buttons. The
league has also received large consign
ments of literature Irom sound-money
leagues of the Middle and Eastern States.
This matter has been very effective in ihe
way of controvertinc and exposing the
fallacies of the free-silver orators.
One of the most effective pieces of work
done by the league was the publication of
the circular issued by the American Mer
chant Marine Association showing that
its president, Arthur Sewall, favors the
Republican protective policy. This circu
lar was printed in large quantities in the
East and caused a big sensation.
Arrangements are under way to organ
ize Republican clubs in all the universities
of the State upon the National League
plan. Stanford, the State University and
the University of Southern California al
ready have enthusiastic, prosperous clubs.
The following paragraph, recently writ
ten by William McKiniey, gives his esti
mate of the National Republican League,
and should stir up the enthusiasm of
leaguers in all parts of the United States,
namely: "The coming campaign is to be
pre-eminently one of education, and there
has never been in the history of parlies in
the United States any such potent agency
for the dissemination of political informa
tion as the National Republican League.
The league has always, since its organiza
tion, been to the forefront of the battle,
and I know that this year it will come up
to the full measure of its duties."
Tne headquarters of the Nayonal League
are at Chicago, and the National officers
are: Edwin A. MoAipin, president; M.
J. Doxrling, secretary;' Aaron T. Bliss,
treasurer.
The officers of the California State Lesgue
are: A. W. Kinney, president, Los An
geles; George Francis, secretary, Los An
geles; George Stone, treasurer, San Fran
cisco. The vice-presidents are : Frank L.
Coombs,Napa,First Congressional District ;

rick, Oakland, Third Congressional Dis
trict; Tirey L. Ford, San Francisco, Fourth
Congressional District; Luther Brown,
Pasadena, Sixth Congressional District,
and Cramer B. Morris, San Bernardino,
Seventh Congressional District.
President A. W. Kinney is a native of
Maine, coming from Boutelle's district,
and has been a resident of this State for
ten years.
George Francis (secretary) is a native
son, and is Deputy County Clerk of Los
Angeles County.
Georpe Stone (treasurer) is president of
the Union League Club of San Francisco,
and is the member of the executive com
mittee of the National League for Cali

FLOOD AND FAMINE
SCOURGE SIBERIA
A Great Loss of Life and
Property by River
Overflows.
Thousands of People Robbed of
Their Homes and Left
Destitute.
LAEGE AREA UNDER WATER
Destruction of Livestock and Crops
Means Suffering for the
Populace.
TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 11.â Late Sibe
rian papers received by the Oriental liner
Tacoma to-day reported great floods in
Siberia, with thousands of people rendered
homeless and destitute. The rivers Sl
phoon, Moor, Santa Cbasa and Inman
were all over their banks and the plain
for hundreds of miles turned into a vast
lake from 20 to 30 deep feet in places. The
Siberian Railway was inundated for 120
versta from Inman, the last station on th Â«
road, and in many places washed away.
For several days telegraphic communica
tion with Viadivostock was interrupted.
Grain crops were being gathered and
the hay was stacked in the fields. All
were destroyed, as well as livestock and
the buildings of farmers. There are
meager reports of great low of life.
The Governor of Viadivostock dis
patched soldiers, steam launches and life
boats to assist in rescue work.
Great distress and a famine will un
doubtedly result from the loss of stock
and foodstuffs. The Government is doing
all in its power to assist the sufferers, but
from the nature of the country the dis
tress can be bnt partially alleviated dur
ing the next twelve months. Siberian
papers call for subscriptions to aid the
sufferers.
The season had been exceptionally wet
in that portion of Siberia. At the
west end of the railway on only
thirty-eight days in the whole season
could field work be carried on. Embank
ments and bridges were washed out and re-.
placed again, only to meet the same fate.
LOS ANGELES TOURNAMENT

LOS ANGELES, Cai*, Oct. 11.â There

Los Angeles City Gun Club team won by a
score of 112 oat of 125. In the individual

each.
Sprinter Wefer'a Performance.
BALTIMORE, Md., Oct. 11.â Bernard
J. Wefers, the famous sprinter, was the
prize beauty at the field sporta at Mary
land oral yesterday afternoon. He was in
fine form and succeeded in equaling two
world's records. He covered 100 yards in
9 4-5 seconds, which is a world's record,
and 220 yards in 22 seconds flat, which is
one-fifth of a second slower than the
world's record. On a second look at the
course it was found that Wefers had gone
five feet further than 220 yards, and all
agreed that he equaled the record of 21 4-5
seconds.

TACOMA, Wash., Oct. 11.â Oriental ad
vices report that a Chinese firm intends to
open in Northern China a large establish
ment for the production of wine. Grapes
have long been grown in that country, but
only for the table. Attempts were made
in 1893 to produce wine. They were so
successful an application to the Chinese
Government was made for a monopoly for
the production of wine from grapes.

MISSION FOR
THE YOUNG MEN
Impressive Close of Four
Weeks' Profitable
Services.
Father Mullane Addresses the
League of the Cross â 
Cadets.
CAUSE FOR CONGRATULATION.
The Reverend Speaker Commends the
Young Hen for tha Pledge
They Have Taken.
The mission for young men which has
been conducted by the Redemptorist
Fathers Mullane and O'Shea at St. Jo
seph' s Church for the last four weeks was
closed yesterday. During this period
services have been held three times a day
with results highly pleasing to the clergy
of the parish.
There was a large congregation present
at high mass yesterday morning. Rev. P.
S. Scanlan acted as celebrant; deacon,
Rev. J. Collins; subdeacon, Rev. J. Mc-
Donald; master of ceremonies, Rev. M.
Scanlan. The sermon was delivered by
Father Mullane. His topic was "Duties
of Parents Toward Children," and he ad
monished his hearers that the labors of
the priests to save the young would be
almost useless if the principles which they
sought to instill from the pulpit were not
conserved in the home.
In the afternoon Rev. Father Mullane
addressed the League of the Cross in the
Parish Hall. Father Mullane as a speaker
readily grasps the sympathy of the young,
and the boys listened intently to the
kindly words of advice to which he treated
them. He drew a striking picture of the
effects which follow early indulgence in
drink, and congiatulated the young men
that they had renounced all forms of in
toxicants until their twenty-first year. At
the close of bis address the leagne mem
bers renewed their pledge.
In the evening the seating capacity of
the edifice was sorely taxed, extra benches
which were distributed in every available
space proving inadequate to accommodate
the surplus. The body of the church was
reserved for and entirely occupied by
young men, in whose interest the mission
has been held.
Father O'Sbea delivered the sermon.
His text was from II Epistle of St. Paul to
Timothy: "I have fought the good fight;
I have finished the course; I have kept
the faith."
In part he said:
If you would imitate St. Paul, and fight the
good fight against every temptation, and fight
for everything that Is noble in your natures
you -will win a crown. Otherwise you may be
cast away. During the past week a battle has
been raging within this very church between
the engels on one side and the devil on the
other. In your hearts was the battle-ground.
You felt difficulties In coming Into the church.
You felt, "How can I relinquish thtose evil
things which I bave learned to love?"
But the angel ol God called you to come, the
tears of your aged mother, the voice of God
within you, all combined to break the tyranny
ol your ains. You confessed your sin* and
they were washed away by the biood of Jesus
and buried In the ocean of eternity.
Young men, .sin has a twofold effect. It sul
lies your soul and It implants an almost per
petual Inclination to repeat the sins you have
committed before. How mauy times nave you
protested on your bended kness that you would
sin no more ? Why did you fall ? Because
you had failed to take note of the warning
from on high. What has happened in the past
will happen in the future unless you conse
crate your souls.
At the conclusion of the sermon Father
O'Shea read the consecration act and all
the young men of the three branches of
the Immaculate Conception Sodality wert
consecrated to the Blessed Virgin. After
that ceremony the solemn benediction and
sacrament were administered by the pas
tor, Father Scanlan.

The greatest roadrace ever held in Cali
fornia was conducted by the Associated
Cycling Clubs yesterday morning over the
ten-mile stretch from Fruitvale to Hay
wards. In point of interest, number of
riders, time made and the value Oi prizes
it excelled any previous event of the kind
ever held in this State.
The day was an ideal one for cycle
racing. A slight Bprinkle of rain Satur
day evening had laid the dust and cleared
the atmosphere, and a brisk breeze at the
backs of the riders facilitated speed and
accounted in a measure for the remarkH
bly fast time made.
The Associated Clubs, composed of all
the prominent cycling clubs within a
radius of fifty miles of San Francisco,
about twenty-five in number, holds four
big roadraces Annuallyâ a 25-mile handi
cap around the San L^andro triangle in
February, a 100-mile relay around the bay
in April, a 20-mile scratch around the tri
ange in July, and a 10-mile straightaway
handicap in October.
It was this latter event which was run
yesterday, and it was the third one held
thus far. In number of entrants it ex
ceeded the two previous ones by nearly
double, and the time made was so ex
ceptionally fast as to border almost on the
marvelous.
Early in the morning the ferry and
railroad officials were made aware that
Bometning great in the cycling line was
in the wind. Pilgrims on wheels from
every quarter were miking Fruitvale and
Haywa;ds ihe.r Mecca.
'here were brawny young men and fair
dam-els In natty bloomer costumes, all
with a set pun ose in their eye. Tie elder
generation, too, seemed stimulated by the
occasion and tlie electric cars toward fa
vored coigns of vantage whence the race
could be viewed were jammed with en
thusiasts of sober minn.
Thither, foo, were hastening vendors of
popular ware:-, eager to reap a brief har
vest among the crowds of the sport-loving
public.
The word had evidently been passed
around by mysterious grapevine telegraph
ti.at some record-breaking might be done.
As it turned out the crowds were not dis
ap 1 ointed.
Viewed as a whole the event was a grand
opportunity for an outiug. Every entrant
had a following. There was his own
family to begin with and then came his
friends and his feliow-clubmen.
END OF ALL
CONTROVERSY
Rev. Father Yorke Holds
It Lies in the Church
of Rome.
THE POPE INFALLIBLE.
Christ Builded the Church as a
House Founded Upon a
Reck.
IN POSSESSION 1500 YEARS.
A Fine Audience In St. Francis
Church List ns to the Chance.
lcr's Latest Lecture-
One of the finest audiences that Rev.
Father P. C. Yorke has addressel in this
City fa a long time assembled last niput
in St. Francis Church, on Vallejo street,
near Montgomery avenue, to near his
lecture on "The End of Controversy." The
admission was 50 cents, and there was
hardly a vacant seat to be seen in the vast
auditorium and galleries. The choir gave
a prelude of some special music while the
audience wns assembling.
Rev. Father Carrahtr. pastor of St
Francis, from the pulpit kindly requested
the large audience to remember that they
were seated in the house of God and not
in a hall. Father Yorke spoke lor uver an
hour. The lecture was not a discussion of
local questions, as the topic might sug
gest, but a comprehensive dissertation on
the authority of the church of Rome.
Father Yorke saiQ substantially:
The end of controversy that I intend to speak
about is, I consider, an end to controversy not
only in this City, but of all controversy of a
similar nature. What would be the natural
end 01 a preÂ»t controversy which divides the
great bodies of the people of this Republic?
There might be an end of controversy by mu
tual agreement â if there were a settling down
into a state of mutual stagnation.
But there may be another end. People may
care lit tie of the matters in dispute, when iv
a city or StaÂ»e or country the people take no
interest in politics then the beginning of the
end of that country has begun; the end of
liberty has come. 80 it is the same way when
m<"n tnke no interest in religion. They have
forgotten what 1* tbe noblest part of them.
1 nere is an end of con;rover*y, and oue end
alone. It we are 10 have an end of contro
versy, then we must a.l t-ettle on uhut is the
truth. Now as to the tru;h aud controversy
of religion, of course there are a large number
of [x-ojile Â»ho do not think there is any truth
In religion. If there is no such truth, then
we are children disputing about a trifle.
But the vast mt jority of the people of this
country are Christians of some sort. They be
lieve there is ; ruth in religion. Now, li there
be any truth then that truth must be the end
of hil controversy. The whole real end is to
find out if there nas in this wide world e^er
been any one to tell us what the truth is.
Now, you know that about 1900 years ago
there appeared a certain muniu Palestine Woo
professed to bring a messaged fiom GoJ â who
professed the truth and taugnt it. The end of
nil controversy must be what Christ said.
What truth there is in him must be the end of
all controversy.
His u-achings were written down. Hence
the Bible and what It says is the end of a 1
controversy. If we study it we shall find in
our hearts that peace which is the end of
controversy.
Nobody can deny that there are in every re
ligious cect and denomination men and wo
men who mean to do what is right and who
are seeking tbe truth. But what Christ speaks
in th â â¢ Bib cis one thing to the Baptists and to
the Methodists or Episcopalians or PnÂ»sbyte
rUns it is something else. We find all denom
inations com ng to the Bible for an end of
controversy, but they go away in more con
fusion.
A few days ago politicians of this City had a
controversy about what ticket had a right to
go before the people. They took the question
to a tribunal, which passed upon and ended
the controversy. Some say the decision was
wrong, but nevertheless it wag au end of the
controversy. There was peace where before
there were deputes.
How is it in religion that we cannot have
â¢uch an end of comrove rsy ? If there is an end
o! controversy in religion, it is to be found in
some religious authority, some tribunal, somo
supreme court, which lias the right of study
ing It and of giving a decision. Religion af v r
ail is the moit important .hlng.
Now our Lord gathered about him a certain
body of men, with whom he had sweet con
verse, lie knew controversy would come.
Lightning Time in the Hay wards Road Race in Which One Hundred Men
Started and Seventy-Nine Finished.
The class of "friends'* very often in
rluded some one at least of the fair sex,
who more than appreciated the fine rk-ure
which her hero presented in racing trim.
Many drivers, too, took advantage of the
chance to give their buggy-horses a
breather and followed the sport with pecu
liar advantage. All in all, it was as motley
an assemblage as ever was drawn together
in the pretty suburbs ol Oakland.
Tne association's events always draw
large crowds to the start and finish of the
races, and yesterday's attendance was
much greater than usual. The race was
scheduled to leave Fruuvalo at 11 o'clock,
and an hour before that time the vicinity
of High street and the San Leandro road
was a mass of cyclers, with more arriving
all the lime. When it came time to start
the different contestants Starter Fawcett
found great difficulty in getting sufficient
clear room lor the riders.
In some places the road over which the
race was run was lightning fast. Twenty
six men rode under the record of last year,
which was 25 mm. 59 4-5 sec, and the fast
est time made was fully a minute and a
half faster than that. It was a case of
"sprint" from start to finish, and those
who had not looked well to their training
soon acquired a tired feeling which in
duced them to quit early in the ride,
whereupon they would carefully inspect
their wheels to give bystanders and pass
ing riders the impre^ion that something
bad happened to their mounts.
Though many fell by the wayside
through inability to keep the pace and
others met with punctures and other
slight accidents, still nothing serious hap
pened to any one and eighty out of the
original 110 entrants finished the rase.
E. J. Smith of the Acme Club rode into
first place from a handicap uf three min
utes and his victory was so complete that
ne tini-hed riding at his ease, sitting erect,
there being no one within a hundred
yards to contest witu him. But after that
they began to come in in twos and fours
and single, with sometimes as many as
ten in one bunch, so that the marvel is
that the judges, timers and scorers placed
them properly.
Above the excited cheering and veiling
of the multitude could be heard Judge
Kerrigan calling the men's positions by
How did h6 provide for it? By giving us them
for a supreme court. He said : "He that hear
etn you neareth me, and ho that heare h me
heareth him that sent me." He sent them out
to teach the truth. The end of all controversy
is Cnristâ not a dead Christ, but the Christ
that is in the midst of us.
That aposto ie college, or whatever you wish
to call it, spoke the vxird, >nd by the author
ity of Christ. When you destroy the machine
which keeps society together, then you also
destroy the society. 1) es it look like com
mon-sense to say ihat alter Christ went 10 the
trouble to teach for turee years that he in
tended it should go to pi< ces? He intended it
to last for all time. "He that heareth you
heareth me."
Our Lord spoke of a society which he was
going to build as a house. We understand
what he means. The first thing that a house
needs is a foundation. The country In which
Jesus Cnrist lived was much like California.
Like tne wise man buildcd, the house was
builded on a rock. He spoke ab ut building
it on a rock. He meant that the organization
should be put on a certain foundation, which
sh. v.d keep it together, and it is the end of
all controversy.
So Christ cnanged the name of Simon to
rock and builded his church against it, and
the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
We believe that Jesus Christ established in
his church an end of controversy â a tribunal
or power to take up controversies and decide
them. In law the quiet possession of property
for a term of years entitles the possessor to its
undisputed possession thereafter. Now, it Is a
curiou-, thing that the power to end contro
versy was in the possession of one body for
1500 years, up to 300 years ago.
The Christian world acKnowledged that that
power existed. We can find it exercised in
every country up to 300 years ago. Surely
sucn possession ought to entitle that body,
that tribunal to the power it claimed, and
that body is known ac the church of Rome. If
we see the necessity of an end of controversy,
the one church alone which should have the
power is the church of Rome, which claims
the right of the court of appeals. Other de
nominations know their own doctrines are
fluctuating.
They confess their liability to err. The Pope
is the lineal descendant of St. Peter, who was
the rock on which the cnurch was built. In
fallibility only means thai wnen a decision 13
handed down from the Supreme Court it is the
right decision. If God establishea that Su
preme Court it is infallible, and if It is not it
is a delusion and a snare, and we were better
off without it.
If the Pope is the end of controversy he
must be infallible. There is only one society
wnich claims the infallible cud of contro
versy. It is the one flock and the one shep
herd of us all. It is one law, one God, one
baptism, one shepherd and one universal fold
into which all the sheep may come.

and several up-to-date scores were
made, notably those of F. O. Young, D.
W. McLaughlin and Mrs. L. J. Crane.
Young ran up a score of 49. Creedinore
count, on the Columbia target, with a
musket, while shooiing in the Glinde
mann military musket match. Mc-
Laughlin made 2,6,5â13, Columbia tar
get, in the three-shot Unfred diamond
medal match.
Among the ladies there is a lively con
test for the tropbv presented by William
Glindemann, and it was acknowledged
tbat the score of 26 made two weeks ago
by Mrs. M. J. White would bÂ« very hard
to beat. Mr-. Crane started out yesterday
with the determination to better the
score, which she did. by Creedrnore rules.
She tied M>s. White's score on points and
beat it with a 3, where in the other score
there was a 6. Mrs. C. F. Waltham has
also entered the competition and prom
ises to put up a good score before the year
spoiled. But to their credit there was not
a slip made in the score, and so everything
was lovely.
When the scratch men came into view
it was seen that Squires, another Acme
man, was leading, with Kenna of Ala

becoming experts ere long.
Colonel Kellogg is again in the Colum
bia's ranks and promises to show the
younger members that he is not a back
number with rifle and revolver. A. H.
Pape is still experimenting with nitro

A" Schuetzen Park
Company E, First Regiment, held its reg
ular monthly medal shoot at Bchuetzen
Park yesterday. The scores made snow a
marked improvement over those of the
past. The attendance was not so large as
usual. The following ten-shot scores were
ma>le on the regular military target:
First classâ Captain Fitzpatrick 42, Lieuten
ant Bob-rtaon 43, Sergeant Howard 38, Cor
poral Shea 39, Corporal Toomey 37, Private
Magee 35, Kircbner33, Suillvan 32.
Second classâ Private Mold-in haver 27, Bol
omou 29, Dwyer 30, Gafi'ney 26, Conuell 27,
Read 19.
An lone Rifleman.
lone, Arnador County, has a marksman
who is likely to cause the men around San
Fiancisco to look to their laurels. He is
Dr. B H. Foreman. On the lone range
recently he made 214 in ten shots on the
German ring tar. ci. With a 22 L. R. Win
chester Dr. Foreman made off-hand on a
Columbia target) 50 yards, 1, 2, 1, 1, Iâ6.
This score equals the best made Â»t the
Shell Mound range, only two men, Hovey
and Jacobson, having done as well. On
the 100-yard range, same target, he made
a string 01 1, 2, 2, L. Iâ7 at rest, and 1, 3, 6.
3, 3, 3, 3. 3, 3, 5â33 off-hand. As their is
no shooiinÃ done on the 100-yard range at
Shell Mound these last scores cannot be
compared, but it is sale to say that such
shooting would keep the men around the
bay busy to beat.

had strageled in, everybody wanted to
know who- had made the best time and
the officials werf besieged with inqniries.
Some thought Williamson of Santa Rosa
had it, others Maack of the Imperials. But a
little quick computation gave it io Squires,
whose ride was a remarkably creditable
one. His time was 25 minutes 20 seconds,
which lowers Byrne's coast record twenty
seven seconds, and is very close to the ex
isting world'- record.

The sudden call for the troops to move
has imposed a pecuniary hardship on Ihe
officers and enlisted men with families.
There has been a deal of money-borrowing
in order to make the trip. . One officer
raised $7U) to lend to the band.
At the Presidio, Alcatraz and Fort Mason
packing up is the order of the day.
Special orders No. 120 from department
headquarters report that official notifica
tion lias b en reÂ« eived of the trans ers of
Major Joseph G. Ramsay from the Third
to tne Filth Artillery and Major John A.
Darlinsr from the Fifth to t c Third Artil
lery. The transfer enables Major Darling
to remain at ihe Presidio. The ta k of
Major Darling securing a triumph over
General Graham in obtaining this transfer
is regarded at department headquarters as
unwarranted. Colonel Shatter, the de
partment commander, says that Major
Darling's application lor a transfer was
approved by General Graham, and on that
favorable recommendation approval at de
partment headquarters followed.
General Graham, who leaves next Thurs
day for ihe Department of the East, nas
commanded the post at the Presidio since
1887, with the exception of an interval of
eighteen months, when Colonel Langdon
was in command. As a disciplinarian he
holds a firm hind on a garrison and re
quires every officer and enlisted man to
perform his duty. He has made some
enemies among civilians who desired to
train their dogs ana pasture liyesto< k on
the reservation, but he has gained the
commendation of many people for his ex
cellent management of post affairs. It
has been his purpose to make the reserva
tion a pleasant park, for ladies and chil
dren, and to this end strict patrol dmy
lias been enforced to prevent tramps from
camping on the premises.
General Graham at first thought of leav
ing his family here, but on second consid
eration decided to take all the members of
his household to New York, excepting one
son, who will remain a> the University of
California. The general will probably re
turn to San Francisco for permanent
residence after his retirement. He ranks
as one of the ablest ana bravest soldiers
in the army. Speaking of some of his
traits an officer of the Filth Artillery re
cently said: "'I am not in love with Gen
eral Graham, but I will say that there is
no discount on him as a soldier. He ex
pects every man to do his duty and sets
the example himself. He has no patience
with offii ers or men who skulk from dan
ger or shrink from duty."
The advance command of the Third
Art llery should arrive in San Francisco
next Saturday. The headquarters, Colonel
Bain bridge, staff, band, Light Batteries C
and F and Batteries A, G, H, I and X will
take station at the Presidio. Tne lieuten
ant-colonel and Batteries D and L will go
to Alcatraz and Battery E to Fort Mason.
Colonel Suter, Major Davis and Lieu
tenant Potter, corps of engineers, are now
at work on the fortifications of this har
bor. Another 12-inch rifle is on the way
to this City.
It will go to Lime Point. Last week the
engineer began the work on three em
placements for twelve such guns on this
side of the channel. Two are being made
on the hill back of the dynamite battery,
and one will be near Fort Point.
Captain James S. Pettit, First Infantry,
has been ordered to proceed to Benicia
Barracks for duty with Company D of
that regiment.
Capiain Marion P. Maus, First Infantry,
has been ordered to San Diego for duty
with Company H.
Lieutenant Dana W. Kilburn, First In
fantry, is relieved from temporary duty
at San Diego and ordered to rejoin bis
company at Angel Island.
Captain Charles G. Starr, First Infantry,
has been ordered to proceed to Alcatraz
Isa id for temporary duty at that post.
Tne leave of absence granted to Brig
adier-General Forsyth has been extended
thirty days.
Lieutenant Charles L. Bent with a de
tachment of the Firgt Infantry will go to
Fort Mason to-morrow for tempoiary
duty.
Leave of absence for one month has been
granted to Lieutenant Louis R. Burgess,
Fifth Artillery.
Among tne officers of the Fifth Artillery
invited to attend the National Guard ban

Graham are Lieutenant-Colonel Sinclair,

*X>B TICF-PBESIDENT-
GARRET A. HOB&RT, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Republican harmony wins.
You can have better times if you work
for them and vote for them.
Get into line for CbarJes L. Taylor and
count one for party harmony.
Demoralized Democrats have no hope i
except in Republican dissensions.
Loyal Republicans will vote for Colonel
Taylor and the party organization.
What kiud of a President do you think
the boy orator would make anyhow ?
Get behind the woman suffrage move
ment and push it along. It is a good
thing.
This campaign affords American labor
an opportunity to get even with the free
traders.
Don't forget that Republican success in
California depends largely on Republican
unity in San Francisco.
The only sure way to avoid Catorism in
the benate is to elect Republican legis
lators, and don't you forget it.
By the time the canvass is over that
single speech of Bryan's will be about as
threadbare as any ether old thing.
Â»
From this time on the campaign should
be pressed with vim and vigor, and every
Republican is counted on to do bis share.
When the mills are running and money
circulates, Bryanism will be forgotten
along with the other misfortunes of the
hard times.
The campaign of education needs no
other text book than McKiniey's speeches,
and iortunateiy these are being read by
the people every day.
Before we can have a general prosperity
we must cease to pay foreigners for manu
facturing our raw material and set our
own people to work at it.
It is a safe thing to challenge any Demo
cratic orator or organ to name a single
American industry tbat was benefited by
the repeal of the McKinley tariff.
All the great Republican orators, Har
rison, Reed, Sherman, Allison, Foraker,
Depew, Thurston and Ingersoll are on the
stump, but where are the Democrats?
Senator Teller is reported to be so
hoarse he cannot speak aoove a whisper,
Bind it is safe to say tbat what he whispers
Will never be given out for publication.
A country whose industries are prostrate
tinder a low tarifi cannot afford to elect to
Congress any man who is not known to
be in favor of uplifting them by the en
actment of a high tariff.
We can never have a good municipal
government unless the people are wise
enough to indorse the actions of capable
and honest officials, and Colonel Taylor's
official record deserves the indorsement
of every good citizen.
Never in the history of San Francisco
â was there a better opportunity for a com
plete Republican victory than is afforded
by the Democratic demoralization this
year. A united Republican vote would
make a clean sweep of all the bosses.
The British are hoping that California
shipments of wheat to India will lower the
price, while we are Loping the Indian de
mand will raise the price, and thus while
the free-traders tell us the interests of Eng
land and America are one they never
seem to work that way.
All signs point to the conclusion that
the Popocrat managers have abandoned
the hope of electing Bryan aud are now
directing their efforts to the election of
legislators who will vote for Popocrat
Senators. This part of the fight must be
watched closely by Republicans, for there
is danger in it.
"We are a nation of working people,"
says McKinley, "We recognize no caste,
or class, or rank, and will tolerate none
beneath this flag." The true Americanism
of tbat sentiment contrasts brightly
aeainst the dark appeals of Bryan to class
prejudice, and the hearts of the people
Will not fail to respond to it
Ola-time Democrats who are concerned
in the preservation of their organization
in California are beginning to see tbat
they are interested in the defeat of the
Bryanistic fusion now being urged in this
State. If the fusion wins the Populists
will be the party of the future in Califor
nia, and only ihe olrt guard, known as the
National Democratic party, or sound
money men, will have any standing as
the representatives of the Democratic
party.
THE MIGHTY FALLEN.
How are tbe mighty fallen! Henry
George, the author of "Progress and
Poverty," at one time the political
economist of tbe poor, the most promi
nent writer upon the rights and
wrongs of labor on this side the
Atlantic, the popular and almost success
ful candidate for the office of Mayor of the
city of New York; Henry George, who
ten years ago seemed to have secured a
permanent niche in the temple of literary
fame, is now content to be the traveling
figure faker of the Bryan aggregation.
How have the mighty fallen!
It is, indeed, a subject for sadness to see
a man like Henry George descend to be
lor hire tbe lightning calculator of a polit
ical campaign and in tbat capacity to use
his talents in juggling statistics, so as to
mislead tbe minds of those who have ad
mired and trusted him. Yet that is his
exact position and attitude with reference
to the coming election. He is reported to
be traveling through the Northern and
Middle States collecting uatt* for the pur
pose of provin? the certainty of Bryan's
victory. He is sending out bulletins con
taining these gathered statistic*, with his
deductions therefrom. No one living
knows better than Henry George that his
figures furnish no warrant for his conclu
sions and that his deductions are as full
of sophistry as an egg is of moat.
Take for example his calculation as to
the probable vote in Michigan. He cites
statistics to show that iv the last Presi
dential election the Republicans cast
222,708 votes, tiie Democrats 202,296 votes,
the Populists 19,892 votes and the Prohi
bitionists 14,069 votes. He then calculates
that a combination of all the otuer ele
ments against the Republicans would give
ttie combine a majority of the votes. After
this quite simple bit_oi arithmetic Mr.
George calmly proceeds to advise us that
this combination "is now assured," and
that, of course, Mr. Bryan will carry
Michigan.
There are so many elements omitted
from Mr. George's estimate of the Michi
gan result as to make it hardly possible
that he failed to observe and consider
them. In the first place, a union of the
Democratic and Prohibition vote is almost
an impossibility in any Western State. It
is quite unnecessary to recount the rea
sons for this. In tbe next place, no ra
tional or impartial statistician believes
tuat fusion between Democrats and Popu
lists wiil result in holding to the com
bination the full past vote of both.
This also requires no demonstration to
the minds of reflecting men. In the third
place the vote of 1892 is of very little value
in an estimate of the vote of 1596, especially
when the Democrats upon the money issue
are taking the opposite v.ew to that taken
four years ago. They then ran an ac
knowledged gold advocate and an open
and avowed enemy of silver for President
and they elected him. Does not Henry
George know better than to argue that the
same vote may be counted npon to elect
Bryan this year? To claim that gold Dem
ocrats are few in Michigan, or iv fact any
where elsa, is to argue against a ston6 wall
of contradicting facts which even a polit
ical sophist such as Henry George has be
come should hardly dare to attempt.
The transfer of Mr. George's addition
mill over into Illinois has not lessened
the obvious fallacies it is engaged io grind
out. He ignores the existence of Palmer,
and, taking Altgeld as his authority,
predicts that Bryan will carry Illinois.
This latest bit of proohecy destroys
Henry George's reputation for either inde
pendence or accuracy in the field of poli
tics, and his own words write him down
as nothing more than a political hack en
gaged to travel at the tail of Bryan's pro
cession scattering delusive sophistries,
and depending on his past record as {
a reasoner to have them believed. It
is a pity Mr. George was not sent into
New England prior to the Maine and Ver
mont elections. If he had been, Bryan
would have carried those States by the
same simple process of reasoning that he
is now assured of Michigan and Illinois. *
It is a historical fact that when the
Republican administration wnnt out we .
were iv a time of great prosperity; tho !
country wa* prosperous to an extent that I
never before had been attained. It is
historically true that sines the Demo
cratic policy has been brought in the
country hag gone step by step from its
pinnacle of prosperity to the very depths
of business depression and distress. Aa \
Republicans, the remedy we propose is j
that a harmonious, well-adjusted, reve- j
n ue- prod uc-iu gaud protec: ive tariff shall
be substituted; that the revenues of the
Government shall be niade adequate to
its expenditures. â Benjamin Harrison.
NO CAUSE FOR ALARM.
The address of Major McKinley to a del
egation from Pennsylvania on Thursday
should be read by all people who bave any
doubts or fears as to the outcome of the
present crisis in our politics. ' Like his
great Republican predecessor, Abraham
Lincoln, McKinley has an unshaken con
fidence in the morality and wisdom of the
people of the United Slates. That confi
dence \vas< cleariy expressed in his speech,
and cannot fail to carry an equal confi
dence to the hearts of all who for any rea
son may be led to fear the iesult of the
present contest.
Mr. McKinley did not overlook the fact
that demagogues exist in the country who
are trying to inculcate doctrines of dis
trust and dismay among the unemployed
and endeavoring to excite the passions and
prejudices of those who are already dis
contented and envious of their more pros
perous neighbors. At the same time, bow
ever, he called attention to the fact that
the great mass of the people have shown
no undue excitement; but, on the con
trary, have given ample evidence of a de
termination to maintain the laws of the
country, the honor of the Republic and its
commercial and industrial prosperity.
As he said: "There need be no alarm,
there need be no excitement, there need
be no abuse or exaggeration, for all those
false doctrines and unworthy influences
will not prevail with the free, the inde
pendent and the intelligent citizens of the
United States. The great majority of our
people are religiously devoted to law and
order, the public peace and public tran
quillity. They love their homes and their
wives and their families too well to stand
by any policy tbat will lead to publio dis
order and disregard oi law."
There can be no doubt of the correctness
of this estimate of the American National
character. We are a law-abiding people.
Demagogues may create temporary dis
turbances here and there, but they cannot
affect the whole body of the American
people. Every intelligent American knows
that no favored classes or privileged castes
exist in this country. Under our laws all
men are equal. Our industries, under a
proper protective system, afford opportu
nities for every man to acquire at least a
comfortable and fcelf-sustaiued home.
These opportunities we will not destroy
by following the wild counsels of dema
gogues.
We bave bad some, experience in the
last three years with the results of
trusting the promises of agitators and

vain dreamers. That experience has
taugnt a lesson which all sane men have
heeded. It is now well known that pro
tect?on is necessary to the welfare of the
country, and no industrious citizen will
vote for the iJryamtes, who, in addition
to destroying the sound system of protec
tion, are also seeking to destroy the sound
system of good money and the funda
mental laws of the Republic.
In 1861 I went into the service of my
country, because I felt that I must go.
In 1*96 I eulist again from the same
impulse, the same impelling sense of
duty. Among college men, whether in
faculty or student ranks, the sentiment
is practicably universal In favor of
sound currency, proper government and
National houor. Of all the men I know
or have heard ot in Brown, Yale, Har
vard, Cornell and tiie other colleges of
the country, JKast and West, there is

Brown University.
GOOD TIMES AHEAD.
According to Bradstreet's report the
general outlook is for an improved de
mand in all lines of business after tbe
election. Trade improvements are al
ready reported in many cities, particularly
in the South, where the activity in the
cotton market has been felt generally in
other lines of trade. Dun & Co. make
similar reports. They declare that "dis
tinctly better conditions of trade have ap
peared of late, and are reflected in the
somewhat larger employment of labor, in
larger transactions, and in continued buy
ine of materials for manufacture."
One of the most notable evidences of the
coming improvement in American trade
conditions is to be found in the enlarged
demand fcr wheat. Biadstreet<fc Co. re
port: The total exports of wheat for the
week amount to 4,050,772 busiieis, aeainst
4,215,000 busheis last week, 2,221.000
bushels in the first week fcr October, 1805;
3,317,0QQ bushels In 1894. 2,362,000 bushels
in 1893 anJ 3,625,000 bnsiieis in the corre
sponding week of 1892.
In addition to the improve^ prices
brought, about by this increased demand
the wheat outlook is further brightened
by prospects of an enlarged crop in this
country. The Government estimate vi
400,000,000 bushels, it is said, is below the
true figure. Bradstreet estimates the do
ine&tic yield will be lully 500,000,000 bush
els. Dun & Co., while not giving figures,
agree that the.ofrleia! accounts are not ac
curate, and that ihe yield will be much
greater than was supposed. There is
reason for believing that the increase in
tins country wiil go far to make up the
shortage of the crop in Russia, India, the
Argentine and in Australia. In any case,
the American farmer has certainly a bet
ter outlook before him this year than for
many years past.
With this improved outlook for the
agricultural interests there is also an im
proved outlook lor manufacturer in the
growing certainty of the eiection of Mc-
Kinley "and the return to the country cf
the protective system. Unless some ex
traordinary an J unforeseen change occurs
the people of this country may look for
ward to an immediate revival of trade and
industry^after the election. All tho great
trade journals of tbe country are agreed
in that- To make prosperity sure, there
fore, nothing more is needed than that
the people should work together to bring
it about by the accomplishment of an
overwhelming Republican victory in Ko
vember.
The American ; people have always
successfully met every. peril which has
assailed the honor or the Integrity of
j the Nation, and they will meet the
crisis of 1896 as they mat the crisis of
18*61. Now, as then, the grand, old
party to which ;we /belong i* in ' the
forefront of the fight, but now, as Ili^u,
it is aided by the . loyal ' and patriotic
Democrats, -who prefer their country
to p*rty regularity. In 1861 we met
the crisis successfully with the sword ;
I in 1896, under the leadership of Mc-
I Kinley and Hobait, we will meet it
! successfully with the ballot.â General

AN UNWISE AGITATION.
The persistent effort of Mr. Bryan and
his Eastern imitators to arouse class an
tagonisms in our country and to array the
poor against those of better fortune, for
political ends, is to be deprecated and
ought to fail.
They know full well that these distinc
tions and hostilities do not by nature
exist. The thinking and common-sense
people of the country also know that be
tween themselves and their neighbors
dwells no such sordid and selfish feeling
as the Bryanites describe. The whole of
this passionate assertion of hatred be
tween masses and classes is nothing more
or less than an attempt to ride into office
upon the saddle of prejudice and un
truth.
It was to be noped that our local Demo- 1
cratic orators who bave been reluctantly
dragged into the campaign would abstain
from this sort of demagogny and argue
for Bryan's election upon other lines. It
is a matter of regret that some of them at
least hay* not done so. At the meeting
in Metropolitan Temple on last Saturday
evening such expressions as "beasts of
burden" and "birds of prey" were in
dalged in for no other apparent reason
than that they sounded well in a Demo
cratic speech.
The gentleman who made use of this
oratorical nonsense had better do a little
thinking before he delivers a speech con
taining sucb sentences in the city which
he is doubtless proud to call his borne, lest
some one in his audience may call upon
him to point out from among bis clients,
friends and neiehbors who are the "beasts
of burden" and which the "birdaof prey."

It la sometimes aaid that we are op

silver in 1878, and â¢nbaequently, In

COAST EXCHANGES.
The Stockton Record, entering Its fourth
volume, announces tbat it is very much alive
and tolerably healthful, its digestion never
having been impaired by luxurious living. It
has grown big and Influential through hard
labor and Drainy enterprise, and in spite of
strong opposition. It certainly bag ample rea
son to rejoice and "point with pride."
The San Bernardino Silver Advocate suspended
publication tor a few days last week, pending
the installation of a new cylinder press and
power-plant in Its office. When San Bernar.
dino County, like the rest of tbÂ» country, rolls
up a large majority for protection and sound
money, tho Silver Advocate vrill probably blame
this suspension as a Tart of the cause of it all.
At this time, however, it would appear that
the free-silver cause would go to pieces K-fcs
rapidly it its advocates would do let>s talking.
The Alameda Argus is to be congratulated
on tbe evidence ot prosperity shown by it in
putting up a building of its own and providing
itself with a new double-cylinder Hoe press
and 10-horsepower engine. The capacity of
the press will be 4.000 eight-page papers par
hour. The men who make the Argus possess
that spirit and enterprise which is bound to
win.
Down near the line which divides California
from Mexican territory the National City
Record is performing good service in the cause
of patriotism. The paper has just celebrated
its fifteenth birthday. It is independent in
politics, but that fuct does not hinder it from
thinking the right way. It remarks that
"some oi the free-silver palaver sent us from
silver headquarters is enoueh to make the
American eagle seasick," and opines that
"the candidacy of Bryan on November 3 will
look as It does to-day when seen through the
wrong end of a telescope."
Entering upon its twentieth year the Men

Sonoma County people are discussing the
subject of the beet-sugar industry and will
probably make a strong bid for one of the pro
posed new factories. Speaking on the mat
ter the Petaluma Argus says:
"We ought to know the varied soils of So
noma County and climatic conditions reason
ably well, and unhesitatingly express the con
viction that there are thousands upon
thousands of acres of land in Sonoma County
where the sugar beet can be grown with great
profit. The corn and hop land of Russian
River and Dry Creek valleys, as well as the
broad acres of other fertile valleys, would pro
duce beets in great abundance. Even the
coastwise potato land will produce the beetâ
not 60 large, proDably, but possibly with an
increase of saccharine substance to compen
sate for tho lack of 'size. It is a matter well
worth the intelligent consideration of our
people, for every new industry we add to our
agricultural resources but broadens and deep
ens the foundation of our industrial future.
A beet-sugar factory anywhere in Sonoma
County would prove beneficial to all, for it
would afford a ready home market for farm
products and employ laborers the cost of
whose subsistence would go into circulation
among our people."
Walker Jones has succeeded George O. Kin
ney as editor and proprietor of tho Mountain

NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES
Italy is about to lay down three battle-ships
of an improved Be Umbcrto type of 13.000 tons.
They will have somewhat thinner armor and
a much heavier secondary battery than the
Re Umberto. Their speed is to be twenty
knots under natural draught and twenty-two
Knots with forced draught, which latter is six
knots more than the speed intended for the
three battle-ships about to be built for the
United States navy.
The British Admiralty is negotiating for the
construction of a large drydock at Singapore.
The actual sea speed of some of the British
war vessels of recent construction has come
quite up to expectations. The Latonu, 3400
tons, on her first cruise steamed twenty-four
hours between Gibraltar aud Malta at seven
tetn knots. The Sirius, of the same class, but
wood and copper-sheathed, after three years
on the Bouth American station, with no op
portunity of docking or cleaning her bottom,
made 18.2 knots on her passage to England.
The Royal Arthur made the trip from Co
quimbo to Ca.lf.o, 1350 miles, in about three
days, at an average speed of 1!Â»J j knots.
Canet, the French gun manufacturer, is
turning out 9.4-inch quick-firing guns and
the Elswicks Naval Arm ment Company has
already placed several 8-inch quick-firing
guns on South American cruisers. This in
equal to quadrupling the batteries of vessels
which hitherto carried ordinary rifled guns of
9.4 ana 8-inch caliber, and one important ad
vantage gained is that it saves from forty to
sixty tons weight in ordnance on each ship.
The French naval maneuvers last July were,
on the whole, a repetition of former experi
ences. The personnel was all that could be
desired, but several of the cruisers broKe down
through machinery defects and the armored
ships lacked the speed and coal endurance
which had been claimed for them.
The British cruiser Talbot, 5600 tons, built
at the Devonport dockyards, has been com
pleted at a coÂ»t of $1,369,280, or $70,515 less
than the original estimate.
In a trial of five French torpedo-boats in the
Mediterranean to ascertain their comparative
speeds, only one, the Filibuster, reached 21J^
knots, two did not come up to 20 knots, and
two were crippled through accidents to the
boilers. The Filibuster is credited with a trial
speed of 23% and the others were rated at 23
knots, from which it would appeal that there
is a very wide margin between anticipation
aud realization. In the first place, two out of
the five are placed hors de combat, while the
other three boats made only 61J-Â£ knots collec
tively instead of 115.5 knots, as was expected.
The war in Africa has caused a lack of
funds in the Italian Navy Department and the
sale of the new cruiser Garibaldi to Argentina
was almost a necessity. It was contemplated
to sell another cruiser, but popular opposition
prevented the sale. Work in the government
yards remained almost suspended for three
months and it is only quite recently that
projects for new ships are seriously enter
tained.
The five new battleships for the British
navy* of 13,000 tons displacement, upon which
work is ready to begin, are to be named:
Canopus, Goliath, Albion, Glory and Ocean.
Each ship will carry sixteen boats, of which
two are large steam launches.

"General Ben Butterworth insulted me just

terday as he began a careful inspection
of his own signature on the register

I don't see anything the matter with

That reminds me of the story they used to tell
in Washington on Bill Travers, the well
known story-teller. Bill was so darned hemely
that the fellows in his club had presented

"The Hawaiian Islands have all kinds of
insect pests," said C M. Heintz yesterday, the
proprietor of thÂ« Rural Californian. "There
are numerous varieties of scale.ugs that are
unknown yet to California. I bave just re
turned from the islands. I went down there
especially to study the pest question. All over
the islands I found tbe Japanese beetle, a
native of Japan and the most destructive in
sect p'.'st known. It eats the leaves off shrubs
and large trees alike and nas already almost
exterminated the wild rose peculiar to the
islands.
"This beetle is a little larger round than a
lead pencil, about half an inch in length, and
light brown. Fortunately it has not got into
California yet; and principally because of the
nrecuutions taken at San Francisco by Quar
antine Agent Professor Craw, who has been
instrumental in keeping out other Hawaiian
inject pests. Hereafter every shrub and fern
imported from the islands will be fumigated
by Mr. Morse, the commissioner. Professor
Koeberle has discovered some new ladybugs
destructive to scales, but it will take two years
of active work to clear the trees about Honolulu
of scales. The sulphur lumig_ting process will
keep the beetles from touching the leaves, and
the cyanide process of fumigation is destruc
tive to cicales.
â¢'There are thousands of acres of idle land in
Hawaii open for cultivation and purchasable
at $25 an acre. Oranges can be grown on that
land to perfection. There are no high-grade
oranges or lemons grown on the islands yet.
Peaches, apricots, pears and apples are en
tirely unknown, except for a few on the island
of Hawaii. All tne fruit is imported from Cal
ifornia. For instance, I saw a head of cauli
flower sell for 25 cents, two tomatoes for 5
cents, three pears for 25 cents, and a basket of
apples for $2 50, and scarce at that. It seems
to me that there is money to be made in grow

MR. BRYAN IS RESPONSIBLE.
New Yorlc Press.
If ever a man deserved crushing defeat, as a
punishment to himself and a warning to
others like him, it is William J. Bryan. Said
Mr. Bryan in his Cincinnati speech on Friday:
"Wherever you have the gold standard you
bave stagnation in business and men out of
work."
We had the gold standard in the McKinley
tarifi years, Mr. Bryan. Then every mill and
factory in this country was busy. Then wages
went up in all manufacturing industries.
Then the wage-earners had so much more
money to spend that In 1892 they were able to
pay for and consume 70,000,000 more bushels
of wheat than in 1895, thouph the population
of the country was 5,000,000 less than it now
is. In the McKinley years the farmer was able
to seli bis crops, getting gold-standard money
for them and paying off his debts with it,
dollar for dollar, and buying what he wanted,
dollar for do.lar.
We had the gold standard from 1883 to
1892, and in that time wages advanced in the
manufacturing industries exactly 50 per cent.
In the trades during the same period wages
advanced 25 per cent lot two hours' less worjc
a day .
We had the pold standard from March, 1881.
to March, 1893, and in that time under pro
tective tariff laws the Government's interest
beariiiK debt Â« as reduced irom $1,660,935,000
to $585,034, '260. /~
When the present free-trade administration
came into power and when the free-trade Wil
son law waa passed we bad "stagnation In
business and men out of work." We had a
million men out of employment, and the wags
payments of tue country diminished by more
than $300,000,000 a year. We had the value
of the farmer's livestock reduced enormouslyâ
the value of our sheep a one whs cut in half,
from $125,000,000 to $65,000,000; his cereal
crops â¢witnoui a market, because the wage
earners could not buy what they formerly had
consumed, and mortgage payments stopped.
We had four issues of bonds, which, principal
and interest, will rost the people $502,000,000
to pay off. We had a constant treasury defl
cienry, because our expenditures vastly ex
ceeded our revenues.
We had all this debt, poverty and misery,
Mr. Bryan, because of the Wilson law. You
voted for that bill. As a member of the Ways
and Means Committee you helped to frame it.
You urged even heavier reductions in the tariff
than were made.
And because you know, Mr. Bryan, that it
was this monstrous Wilson law that brought
ruin to the country, you are afraid to discuss
ihe tariff. You take a coward's refuge behind
the money issue. It was you and the Wilson
law. Mr. Bryan, which brought "stagnation in
business and men out of work." You, as
much as Grover Cleveland and Professor Wil
son, are responsible, and the people of the
United States will exact the penalty from you
on election dayâ tne penalty of a defeat that
will be a shame and a disgrace to you.
THE SILVER TRUST.
What Some of the Newspapers
Have to Say of the Great
Combine
The production of silver in the United States
last year was 55,727,000 ounces. At its pres
ent price that annual output is worth $36,768,
--882. Under free coinage the value of tais out
put would be increased to $71,887,830, mak
ing an additional profit to silver miners over
and above that they now realize of $35,118,
--848, which they will not receive unless Mr.
Bryan is elected. Where is there another trust
or combine that could be so largely benefited
by National legislation?â Washington Times.
The campaign of this year has become a con
test between the concentrated money power
of a single great industry and the diversified
interests of the Nation. If the sugar trust or
the Standard Oil Company had gained control
of a great political party, named its candi
dates and written its platform and was con
ducting a campaign with an eye single to en
riching itself, regardless of the sufi eriugs that
might be brought upon the country, the situ
ation would not be different from what it is
now when the silver trust has done this very
thing.â Buffalo Express.
As the remit of ihia (Merrill's) circular a
Bryan campaign financial committee, to have
charge of the collection of these funds, has
been appointed. The names which bave been
announced are those of silver barons worth
from $1,000,000 to $50,000,000. And yet
tbeir candidate goes up aud down the country
appealing to the poor to take sides against the
rich, when a few hundred very rich men and
a few thousand men who are waiting to specu
late in siiver stocks are the only ones of 70,
--000,000 people who will be benefited by the
free coinage of silver. There never Was such a
conspiracy of millionaires agaiust the best in
terests oi the whole country. â Indianapolis
Journal.
W. K. Hearst, owner of the New York Jour
nal, the free-silver organ of the East, is one of
the heaviest contributors to the Bryan cam
paign iund. He is vice-preaident of the On
tario mine in Utah, a mine which, according
to Judge Colburn, one of Utah's delegates to
the opening Ceremonies oi the New York Min
ing Exchange, February 16, has paid 197 suc
cessive monthly dividends, aggregating $13,
--190,000. Mr. Hearst, as owner of one-tMrd of
the stock, has been drawing a yearly income
irom his mine of about $274,376. Under the
silver purchase acts the siiver mine syndicate
has already compelled the Government to pay
about $146,000,000 as a tribute to the silver
trust, that amount being the profit pocketed
by the owners of the bullion purchased by the
Government. Ii elected can Mr. Bryan ignore
this powerful trust which is staking Its future
existence upon the success of the Popocrat
ticket ?â Chicago Times-Herald.
The letter published yesterday of Thomas G.
Merrill, secretary of the Bimetallic League oi
the Silver States, and confirmed and further
explained in our special dispatch from Salt
Lake City to-day, is an extraordinary docu
ment in many ways. It is especially so in its
candor. Mr. Merrill proposes without a b.ush
that the siiver-mine owners shall contribute
oue month's profits and buy the Presidency of
tho United States as a speculation. With all
the calm assurance of a promoter offering a
new trust stock he explains to the silver-mine
owners that this will be an unusually good in
vestment. It will enable them, he gays, to
convert their bulliou into legal-lender coin at
$1 29 per ounce, thus ativins; them a clear profit
of 64 cents an ounce in addition to tbe profits
they make now. That is to say, he snows them
that by contributing a month's profits each
they can probably buy the exclusive privilege
of furnishing money to this country and com
pelling the people to give them $1 for every
51 cc. its' worth, of silver they produce. â New
York World.
Those who are asking the enactment of legis
lation intended to give a better market and
more dividends to the silver miners must have
a strong belief in the long-s- uffering patience,
of the American people. To placate these
miners we have aiready passed two silver
laws, under the operation of which we have
paid the miners $464,000,000 for silver bul
lion that at lapt accounts was worth only
$318,000,000. That means, as may readily bÂ»
seen, an uuimHte loss of $2 for every man,
woman and chid in the United States, and it
has been incurred for the benefit of nobody
except the silver miners. Under the free coin
age now proposed such losses would increas
ingly continue at the expense of the poor a.Â»
well as the rich, all of whom would be forced
to contribute for the benefit of those producers
of bullion who have already made a great deal
of money out of us.â Providence Journal.
HOW THE FARMERS FEEL.
Icesult of a Straw Vote Taken at Sacra
mento the Other Day. â '-.
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Sir:
During the session of tne Slate Grange at Sac
ramento last week there was considerable
said about politics among the members alter
they -.' got '. out .on . the street On Thursday
Cyrus Jones, a member of the San Jose Grange,
took a straw vote of the members as they came
out of the Grangers' hall, the result being as
follows: McKinley, 41; Bryan, 20; doubt
ful. 2. - â *.
The Master of the State Grange, W. W. Greer,
has a McKinley button on his coat, and re
marked that he is proud* to wear the button in
tne Grange or out of it. for the members do
not talk politics while in session. W. ii. M.
QUEER ELECTION BETS.
Another novel bet has been mad* in Phila
delphia. The loser is to resign his present
position and for a year take up one in an en
tirely different branch of industry.
Two young men of Philadelphia have been'
paying very marked attention to the same
younjr lady. They have decided to let the elec
tion settle matters for them. If the Democrat
wins the Republican is to stop calling on the
young lady for six months, and vice versa.
A wager was drawn up at SL John, Kans.,
the other day as follows) "W. Glassoock and
C. Burnett make an agreement this day, that
if McKinley is defeated Glasscock is to eat a
large, warty load, but if he is elected Burnett
is to eat the toad."
A novel bet was made last week by S. C.
Frost and J. L. Fuller of Sboshone, Idaho.
Frost has 600 tons of hay cut and stacked.
Fuller it to pay Frost $6 per ton for said hay if
Bryan is elected President, ana should Mc-
Kinley be elected Fuller seta the hay for noth
ing.
Under the requirements of an election bet
Druggist Krautzman of Sedalia, Neb., will saw
and split a cord of wood in front of his store
in the event of Bryan's success, whereas Mc-
Kiniey's victory will call for like exercise on
the part of V. K. Hall, the other party to the
wager. __ _______________
WHY BRYANISM IS CONDEMNED
Salinas Owl.
The Bryanites may talk free silver all they
please and tell the honest farmer to procure
his sack for the bright dollars to come, but
they can't pull the wool over the sheepmen's
eyes this year or make the sugar-beet raisers
believe that the country has nourished batter
since they were paid $4 a ton for bet- ts than
when they were getting $5.
BEET-GROWERS FOR McKINLEY.
WatsonvlUe Pajaronian.
The beet-growers of the Pajaro, Salinas and
San Juan valleys will lose $120,000 this year
because of the repeal of the McKinley act.
That is a big lot of money even in a gilt
edged, prosperous year, and these time* it la
a great big lot.

DEATH, DISASTER
AND DESERTIONS
News Brought From the
Arctic by the Steamer
Jeanie.
Only Twenty - Seven Whales
Were Taken by the Entire
Fleet So Far.
NUMBERS DIED FROM EXPOSURE
The Second Mate of the Balaena Shot
by His Superior Officer During
a Duel.
The first news from the whaling fleet in
the Arctic arrived yesterday and it is not
at all reassuring. It is a story of deaths,
desertions, fighting scrapes, a duel,
mutiny, and to crown ail, a poor catch.
The entire fleet only took twenty-seveu
whales, and in consequence everybody
connected with the fleet is disconsolate.
As a forerunner the tender Jeanie got in
from tbe Arctic with her pumps going.
Ever since leaving Herschell Island she
has been leaking more or less, but during
tbe last few days of the trip the pumps
had to be keDt going continuously. Im
mediately upon her arrival she was taken
to the Arctic Oil Works and tne work of
discharging her was at once began. She
brought dewn 50,C00 pounds of bone for
the Pacific fc'team Whalinr Company and
9800 pounds for James McKenna. The
catch of the fleet up to the middle of
August was as follows:
Ealaena 10 1 Thrasher 1
Grampus 10 Jeanette 1
Mary D.Hume 6 Karlnte 1
Newport 8 Alexander 8
Jessie H. freeman... 4 Earless 3
Bflusa , 2 Wanderer 1
Narwhal 4 California 1
Gayhead 3 Northura lijjht 4
Aiice Knowles ]Â»
The vessels reported as "light," are the
Andrew Hicks, Belvedere, Cape Horn
Pigeon, Charles W. Morgan, Hidalgo
(supposed to be lost), Horatio, John and
Wintbrop, Lydiu, ilerniaid, Navarch,
Orca, Kosario and "William Baylies. The
latter vessel is on her way to San Fran
cisco. She ran into an ice floe in the Sea
ol Okhotsk and sprang a leak. Captain
Mclnnis wanted to proceed to the Arctic,
but the crew refused to go. A mutiny was
imminent, and the master gave in. The
chances are tbat when the Bas'lies reaches
port there will be a number of arrests.
After the Jeanie clocked Captain Mason
went at once to tbe office of tbe Pacific
Steam Whaling Company. He was clos
eted for a time with General Manager
Griffiths, but whru at leisure made the
following statement:
"From wbat I heard, last winter was the
most severe ever experienced ia the Arc
tic and the summer was correspondingly
cold. The men suffered terribly and de
eerlions front the fleet at trie mouth of tne
AlcKenzie River were irequent. There
was a general eioiius at one time and five
men out of the crowd got away. Tney
have not been heard Irora sdnce. The
others were brought up when a shower of
bullets came after them from tbe pursuing
officers. One oJ the fugitives was wounded,
but, I think, afterward recovered.
"Among those who died during the win
ter were: William Mosher, second mate
of the bark John and Winthrop; Harry
Williams, cabin boy of the bark Wanderer,
and James Leary, second mate of the
steamer Belvedere.
"There was a regular old-fashioned
ehooting scrape on ihe steamer Bal&ena
during the winter. Chief Otticer H. P.
Bowen and Second Mate Frank Jones
quarreied. It was patched up fur a time.
but finally the trouble broke out again and
ihe men came to blows. Then a duel on
(he ice, so they say, was arranged and
Jonrs was mortally wounded. He died a
few hours later and was buried at Herschell
Island. Bowen is under arrest and will
be brought to San Francisco for trial.
"The Balaena and Grampus wintered in
Franklin Bay and the lormer reported
four deaths and the latter two deaths.
Who the men were I could not learn, I am
sorry to say. Botn ships got to Herschell
Inland August 29 and it was their inten
tion to return about September 1. The
Grampus, however, may remain in the
Arctic for another season. All in all, it
has been a disastrous season for the fleet."
Private advices received by General
Manager Griffiths of the Pacific Steam
Whaling Company state that the Fearless,
Newport, Mary D. Hume, Jessie H. Free
man, Wanderer and Grampus will proba
bly winter off the mouth of the McKenzie
river tnis year. Last winter there were
sixteen vessels alto^eiher in the ice, but
next season there will be only a halt dozen
to chase the whales when the ice breaks
up.
Captain H. H. Bodfisb of the steamer
Newport came down on the Jeanie. His
ves>el wintered in the Arctic last season,
but he has no more news to teil than Cap
:a:n Mason. In fact Captain Mason's views
is based on information given him by
Captain Bodfisb. The changes necessitated
by Captain BorifiSh's return to . v an Fran
cisco were as folows: Cartain George B.

Labor Commissioner Fitzgerald was
elected a member ex-oflicio of every com
mittee. This was done for the reason
that Mr. Fitzgerald has the power to sum
mon people before the comtuittees in the
course oi investigations necessary for es
tablishine foundations for labor laws.
James Rose, F. M. Thompson and John
McCartney were elected as a committea to
invite the Labor Commissioner* to the
convention.
At the opening of the afternoon session
James Rose was elected permanent presi
dent, C. E. Hawkes vicp-president, Guy
Lathrop secretary, J. Walter treasurer,
James Adams sergeant-at-arms.
The committee on organization reported
that it recommended the new organization
be called the California Labor Convention,
tbe purpose of which shall be to propose
and amend labor laws and further the en
actment of such laws. It shall consist of
duly accredited delegates from all bona
tide trade and labor organizations of the
State of California.
The basis of representation shall bo
three delegates from each organization,
and the initial fee $3 from eacn organiza
tion.
The officers of the convention shall con
sist of a president, vice-president, secre
tary, treasurer, sergeant-at-arms ; also
committees on resolutions, credentials
and linance.
The president reported that tbe com
mittee selected to wait on the iÂ»abor Com
missioner had seen him during tbe noon
recess, but he could not attend owing to
other previous engagements. Mr. Fitz
gerald said he would attend the next ses
sion oi the convention.
The following letter from the Los An
geles County Council of Labor was read :
Los Angeles, Oct. 6, 1896.
Ihe Bon. E. L. Fitzgerald, Labor Commit
tionerâ Dear Sib: The president of the
council turned your letter over to me for
reply. I have been unable to attend to it
.until to-day. I am instructed to say that we
can make good use of 5000 copies oi tbe laws
to which you refer.
VVe are pledging all legislative candidates
here In support of certain laws which we be
lieve necessary for us, and we will gladly co
operate with San Francisco Trades Council
and tUI other organized bodies with a view to
i that end. I hope In a few days to send you a
copy of these laws. Very respectfully yours,
Joseph Phillis.
Delegate McArthur of the committee on
resolutions) stated that his committee had
met during recess and concluded that, as
its work consisted of looking into labor
bills, to request the convention to submit
all resolutions before Thursday night,
when the committee will meet and organ
ize permanently at 1159 Mission street.
Henry Meyer moved that the proposed
labor laws be discussed. This aroused
some controversy, several delegates hold
ing that the documents should be submit
ted to tbe committee on resolutions, it
was eventually decided to discuss the pro
posed laws informally and submit them
with recommendations to that committee.
The first amendment provides for pight
hours' labor in each day. Delegate Furu
seth claimed it should have the addition
"only eight hours." The convention in
dorsed the general idea and referred the
bill to the committee on resolutions for
careful revision and reconstruction. Sec
tion 3245 of the Political Code provides
that eicht hours shall constitute a day's
work: The statute is not definite and is
capable of circumvention by contractors
who nay by the hour, and is therefore in
many instances inoperative, r quiring aa
amendment to render its enforcement ef
fective.
No. 2, an act to provide for the proper
sanitary condition of bakeries and the
preservation of the healih of employes
therein, calls for a uniform law requiring
cleanliness and to insure purity in the
manufactured products of this industry.
Some of the delegates declared that it was
class legislation and consequently uncon
stitutional. Furuseth contended it was
framed in tbe interest of preserving the
health of tbe community, and suggested
that a bakeries inspector be appointed
from the ranks of journeymen bakers.
Delegate Grassman of the Bakers' Union
said the Board ot Health had appointed a
bakeshop inspector a montb ago, but he
has done nothing since. The representa
tives of that uuion told tbe convention
that "rotten egns, rancid butter and rot
ten lard" are used in pastry bakeries, and
that "cats, ruts and all kinds of animals"
live in the bakeshops.
The amendment was referred to the
committee on resolu;ions with a recom
mendation to eliminate all reference m it
to the Labor Commissioner.
The third consideration is an act to pro
hibit the awarding of contracts for public
work to persons having judgments stand
in against them for nonpayment of labor.
Referred to the committed. It is in
tended to prohibit Boards of Supervisors,
Common Councils, Commissions, etc.,
awarding contracts to persons who have
previously defrauded laboiers of tneir
wages. Tbis practice is carried on to a
large extent in San Francisco. There
being no lien on public work, the laborer
is placed at the mercy of his employer,
with many disastrous results.
An act providing for a bond for the pro
tection of laborers upon public works was
referred.
Sections 5 and 6, regarding the State
Labor Bureau, were passed until next
Sunday, when the Labor Commissioner
will be present.
An tct fixing the minimum rate of com
pensation for labor at $2 per day on puolic
works wa9 referred with a recommenda
tion that the qualifying word "unskilled"
be introduced.
An act to add to the Political Code of
the State of California two new sections,
to be numb -red sections 3246^ and 3247^Â£
respectively, regulating the hours of labor
of persons employed in bakeries, was dis
cussed at length. As the limit in it is ten
hours the convention did not regard it
with favor and referred it, with the under
standing that the convention loofced on it
witu disfavor as a whole.
The ninth act is one to enforce the
prompt payment of wages of laborers in
lawful money of the United States. It
was referred after the delegates had com
mented on a section which appeared to
lavor the "truck" system.
The convention adjourned until next
Sunday morning.
GARROTED AND ROBBED,
John Carroll, a Laborer, Relieved
of His Watch and
Money.
Two Men Supposed to Have Followed
Him From a Dive to Merchant
and Montgomery Streets.
John Carroll, a laborer employed at
Smith's Camp, Five-Mile House, San
Bruno road, was garroted and robbed by
two men at Montgomery and Merchant
streets at an early hour yesterday morn
ing.
He came into tbe city to have a good
time and sampled tbe liquor in several of
tbe dives on the Barbary Coast. He had
plenty of money wit i him and was lavish
in his expenditure in "treating" the usual
habit ues of those resorts,
Between 2 and 3 o'clock be found him
self on Montgomery street and was walk
ing in the direction of Market street with
the intention of getting back to tbe camp
when, as he was crossing Merchant street,
a man came up behind him and graobeu
him by the throat with both hands.
The robber jerked Carroll's head back
ana Carroll, who is a powerful fellow,
struggled fiercely to get out of his grasp.
Just then another man came up and struck
Carroll on the head with some instrument,
knocking him senseless.
When he recovered his senses he fonnd
that bis watch and $40 in coin had been
taken out of bis pockets. He was dazed
from the blows on nis head, and while
struggling to get to his feet a policeman
appeared. Carroll told him be had been
beaten and robbed and the patrol wagon
was summoned. Carroll was taken to the
Receiving Hospital, where three wounds
in his scalp were stitched and dressed by
Drs. FiUgibbon and Maber.
Owing to the darkness Carroll was un
able to give a description of tbe two rob
bers, but tbe police think they are fre
quenters of some of the dives and had fol
lowed Carroll until he got to Montgomery
and Merchant streets, which is usually
deserted in the early hours of the morn
ing. Tbe police are working upon tbat
theory.
SAUSALITO IS
DISCONSOLATE
The Fleet of Ships That
Were Tied Up There
Are Gone. \
Only the Steamer Oregon and
the Yachts Lurline and
Rover Are Left.
ALL THE VESSELS CHAETEEED.
Return of the Coast Whalers-The
Venture Was a Failure and
Trouble Is Brewing.
Of all tbe fleet of deep-water ships that
crowded Richardsons Bay a few weeks
ago, the only one left is the steamer Ore
gon. Even the yachts have gone, and
were it not for the fact that the Lurline
was towed in by.-the State tug Markham
and the Rover remained at anchor because
the drawbridge at Tiburon was not opened
in order to allow the yachts to go into wiu
ter quarters, the bay would have prac
tically been deserted. As it is, the Ore
gon looms up in solitary grandeur, and
those who travel on the ferry-boats look in
vain for the fleet of sailing ships that
added to the picturesqueneas of the scene,
and put dollars in the pockets of the Sau-
B&lito tradesmen.
Whaling on the coast has received a set
back. It was thought that one of the
mammals brought in and placed on exhibi
tion would pay a handsome dividend.
The steamer Queen went out with an ex
cursion party and a whaling crew, but
lailed to catch a whale. Tne venture was
a failure, and there is now considerable
liquidation over the bills contracted by
Manaeer Wills.
A few weeks ago Wills got up a second
expe ditiou and interested T. P. H. White
law, Captain Savin, F. Christiansen, W.
Ford and W. Brindelson in tbe scheme.
They secured boats and all the necessary
paraphernalia and went to Halfmoon Bay.
For three weeks they camped on the
beach, and day and night men were kept
on the outlook. All they sighted were
a ''tin- back" and two "hump-backs." Tbe
former was no good, and the latter were
only seen at sundown. Provisions began
to run short and the crew insisted on com â¢
ing baclt to San Francisco. They had a
terrible time getting here. At times the
wind would take command, and than
again they would be in a dead calm and
would have to labor at the oars. When
tney arrived here last Friday night every
boly was tired and half-starved. Thay
were around town yesterday looking woe
begone. The men don't know where
to apply for their pay and they cannot
find Wills.
In the meantime Whitelaw & Co. want
to know where they are going to "get off."
The chances are that the whole matter
will be ventilated in the com ts. In fact
one suit based on the first excursion has
been decided in favor of Qoodall, Perkins
& Co., the owners of tbe Queen.
The ears of Captain Rae of the British
tramp steamer City of Dublin should be
tingling. He was called hard names on
'change yesterday in English, German,
French, Swedish, Danish and almost
every known tongue. Every owner ot a
coaster that happened to be downtown
joined in the chorus, and had the skipper
happened along about that time he would
have enjoyed a bad quarter of an hour.
The City of Dublin is from Yokohama,
and at 6a. m. on the 10th hist, she passed
a derelict vessel in latitude 38 deg. 5 mm.
north, longitude 127 deg. 32 mm. west.
Tbe hull was about 125 feet long and was
partly capsized. There was no sign of
life aboard.
Now what vessel was it? For the last
few days the sea outride has been like a
mlil pond. Captain Rae passed within
hall a mile of the wreck and it would not
have taken him half an hour to have
s, earned arounu it and found out the name
and made sure there was no one aboard.
Even tbe tnouglitof salvage never entered
his head, so be steamed along and a few
hours later entered port and made his re
port. Now every shipowner and shipping
man in port is wondering what vessel the
derelict is.
The Spreckels tug Vigilant broke her
cylinder head last Saturday afternoon.
This was unfortunate as sbe was to have
cone out on a fishing excursion to tbe
Farallones. Superintendent Hawley, how
ever, managed to spare the Fearless so
Oaptain Clem Randall went out on her
and took all the passengers the law al
lowed. It was a little rough outside and
some of tbe excursionists were seasick, but
nevertheless many a good string of rock
cod was brought in. The Ida and Nettie
Low also went out but owing to getting 100
far north they had to put into Bolinaa.
REV. MR. ADAMS ACCEPTS.
Be Has Resigned His Pastorate In St.
Louis.
At tbe morning service yesterday at the
First Congregational Church the congre
gation was pleased to learn of the accept
ance of their call issued to Rev. C. Adams.
Rev. Dr. Baldwin, who occupied the
pulpit, announced the lact by reading the
following telegram :
St. Lotris, Oct. 11.
I have resigned my pastorate here to accept
your call. C. Adams.
There was no demonstration on receipt
of the intelligence, but tbe whole congre
gation rose and joined in singing the dox
ology.

Peet Will Be Re-e.ected to the

The State Convention of the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union will begin at
Fetaluma to-day. Holding the con

ing to the delegates who will assemble in

frage, mothers' meetings, scientinc tem
perance and Demorest contest woric.
Mrs. Henrietta fcjkelton, the National
organizer, has done much effective work
in ilie last two or ttiree months. In north
ern counties she has succeeded in forming
twenty unions, with a membership of 515
persons.
It is expected that Mrs. B. Sturtevant-
Peet will be re-elected at the coming con
vention for the State presidency, fche has
tilled her high position most satisfactorily,

FRATERNAL BONDS
Order of the Kasteru Star.
There are but very few men connected with
fraternal organizations who have given as
much time and attention to an order as has
James Bi-stor Merritt of Oakieaf Chapter, Or
der of the Eastern Star, and at present worthy
grand patron of tne Grand Chapter of the or
der. Mr. Merritt nas a fraternal record of
which he mÂ«y well be proud. It is as follows:
Wor-hipful iuasier, Oak Grove Lodge, X and
A. M., 1885: high priest, Oakland Chapter, R.
A. M. 1896; thrice illustrious master, Oak
land Council, R. and S. M.. 1884 and 1894;
eminent commander, Oakland commandery,
K. T.. 1887; venerable master, OaWand Lodge
of Perfection, 1885; wise master, Gethsemane
Chapter Rose Croix. 1856; eminent command
er, De Molay Council, _aoosh, 1887; erand
master. Grand Council, R. and S. M.,1888;
g<-and master, Graud Consistory, Thirty-second
degree, A. ana A. S. Rite, 1893; worthy patron
of Oak eaf Chapter, O. E. .-., 1887 ; worthy
grand patron, Grand Chapter, O. E. S., 1896,
and member of the Royal Order of Scotland.
During the term that will close on me 20th Inst.,
James B. Merritt.
P'lllllBWBBWSg"Â»F
the worthy patron, who is a man of means and an
enthbsias in iraiernal matters, has devoted much
of his timtj to the npbul ding of the order, of
which he is the highest officer, and in the pursu
ance of this be has, at his own expense, pnid j
fraternal visits to almost every chapter in this i
State and to some in the State of Nevada. He has '
been from *Â»an Diego to Siskiyou and from. the
eastern to the western boundary of the state, and
during the term hÂ»-s called on ail but twelve of the i
131 chapters under the jurisdiction of the Grand j
Chapter. Up to last Tuesday he had paid to these I
1:0 visits, and. as he la ends to continue visita
tions until the day befor â¢ the meeting of. the
Grana Chapter in th:s City, he hopes to be with j
tho^e twelve he had not visited, before that time. !
Many of the places be wen: to are far out o the
way, and the difficulties of reaching them not few.
His visits have been hailed with pleasure and the
advice and Instruction he gave to the cha ters j
have proved of the greatest >c efiL A result of i
bis activity is apparent' in the marked Increase that ;
theoruer shows dur.n his term. Eighteen new I
chapters have been organized and instituted and j
thene. gain in m mbership, after deducting a loss
of 799 by death m d suspension, s 1105. with nve
chapters to hear from. Tbe total membership of,
the order is now more than 8703. When the
worth.- grand patron retires from the field of ac
tive service, it will be wi b.lhe satisfaction that he j
haÂ« done mur for the oraer than any other grand
officer o. eupylng the position i.c did, and that his ;
wont was not through s -llishness, but though a
desire to uo the greatest amount of good to the
greatest number. ere ther- mure of his kind in
the fraternal world, the better that world would be.
Oaxleaf Chap t-r has added tweive to its mem
bership since it handed its annual returns.

QUITZOW TALKS
Of CITIZENSHIP
Gives His Ideas of What
Constitutes a Good
Citizen.
Says Something More Is Needed
Than Regular Hab ts and
Churca Membership.
MUST VOTE CiN: CIEKTICUaLY.
Dec ares That High T xes Are Due
to Citiz ns FaLing to Perform
Their Full Lv y.
The Good Citizenshp meeting at Metro
politan Temple yesterday afternoon was
not the success the management antici
pated. Dr. Derrick, who was down on the
programme as the "Oakland Orator," was
to have discoursed on "Good Citizenship,"
but failed to put in an appearance. It was
given out that he had been called to the
be I side of a sick friend.
This wa.Â« not the only discouraging fea
ture of the day, however. The pro
gram tnes failed to arrive on time, and the
audience was equally slow in putting in an
appearance. This was probably advan
tageous to the management, for it had
agents at the head of the stairs soliciting
every voter to sign the application of the
Independent candidates who are now
seeking to have their names placed on the
re ular ticket.
In spite of ttiese drawbacks, however,
the meeting was far from being a failure.
There were songs and recitations, and a
speech by Chairman Quitzow. He, too,
sel cted tne subject of "Good Citizenship,"
but his remarks were directed largely to
the political issues of the day. Among
other things he said:
I have but one lamp by which my feet are
guided, and that is the lamp of experience,
and. judging the future by the past, what has
been our experience gained Iron* the want of
good cit zensnip ?
There seems to be a very vague idea of what
constitutes a good citizen.
It is generally supposed that a man is a good
ciiizen who attend-; to his business, has regu
lar habits, is industrious, frugal, temperate,
saving, and who goes to church reguiarly, is a
kind and good husband and father.
At first glance hardiy any one would hesi
tate to say surely one with all these virtues
must be a good citizen; but I will risk it to
say yea, he is a good man, but. I will deny that
he is a good citizen.
A man to be a good citizen should have ail
the good qualities heretoiore enumerated, but
he must aito do something lor the communiiy,
the county and State that secure to him the
privileges he enjoys and enable him to enjoy
the protection of a good government and
thereby the fruits of his many virtues.
What he should do tor himself, his family,
his business, his neighbor aud the community
is to acquaint himself with the politic" of his
country. The whole American fabric of seJ
government depends upon the intelligence of
Its ceopie, and how can a manâ an Amerl
cÂ«n-know where the immense drainage upon
his resources made in the shape of exc.ssive
taxation, comes from If he does not acquaint
himself with the primary cause of such bur
dens t
The primary cause of the excessive taxes of
the City and County of San Krnr.uibco, ior iu
stance, is a neglect of the to-calied good citi
zen to attend to his duties as a citizen.
What does he do whe:i it comes to trusting
the management of the affiirs of the City or
the State into the hand of the office-seeker, or,
better named, tax eater? Does he try to in
form himself of the qualifications, the honesty
and capability ol tne man who asks him to
trust him with expending of moneys de
rived from taxation? No, he votes for him
because be is a Democrat, a Republican or
what not- Wiiat should he do to perform his
duty as a good citizen? He suou.d take an
active part in primary politics.

SUGGESTS FUSION
But the Facts in the Case
Prove the Contrary
to Be True.

Farther Apart Than Ever
Before.
REPUBLICANS IN HARMONY
Disappointed Candidates Have Had
Their Wardance and Are Now
Back in Camp-
Oakiakd Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Oct. 1L J
A large banner was suspended across
Broadway yesterday. It was a "fusion"
banner and was hung in the sky for the pur
pose of creating the impression tbat local
Democrats and Populists are in harmony
and are working together. Half of the
banner is inscribed "Democratic County
Committee" and the otner half is appro
priated by the Populists. The headquar
ters consists of a room with two windows.
One is painted with the Democratic sign,
the other with the Populist. The attempt
to give the appearance tbat a combination
has actually been formed is so bold that
every intelligent person walking either
up or down Broadway is forced to smile.
To even suggest that there has been a
fusion between the two parties in tnis
county is a caiumny. In reality there is
more distrust and jealousy between tnem
than was ever known before. At the
meeting at Elite Hail last Thursday, which
was called a "siiver" meeting, who were
the vice-presidents? Not W. B. Eugiish
or his brothers, nor any of the leading
lights of tbe Democratic party. Does any
one suppose for an instant tnat W. W.
Foote and A. A. Bretz, who made some
history in the Legislature, are sailing in
the same boat? Or that astute men like
ex-Sheriff McKiliican and Frank J. Mof
fitt would condescend for a moment to
march in the same procession as I*. H. B.
Roseberg and Attorney Aram?
Robert Fitzgerald and Cleve Dam wish
the public to believe that they have locked
arms politically with C E. Gardner and
Major Howe. The idea is absurd, but
not more absurd than the decention is
complete. Fusion between Sheriff White
and P. E. Dalton, or Chief of Police Lloyd
and M. F. Tarpey.
The old guard of the Democracy of this
county has been forced by its conscience
to repudiate the Chicago platform. The
men who made the party and who con
stituted it are in it no longer. John R.
Britton, ex-Mayor J. West Martin, Thomas
Prather, J. C. Martin and many otber pow
erful names are not now on the Demo
cratic roll. Tney have fused, but it is
with the sound-money men, and the twin
banner certainly possesses no significance
so far as they are concerned.
Where, then, is the fusion ? It begins
and ends in the banner.
Since the county convention was held
and tbe multitude of aspirants for nomi
nations have learned their fate, the Re
publican party has settled down to united,
active work. For a few days after tbe
conventions at Vallejo and Alameda there
were some discoutented Republicans, and
if the election had been held tbe following
day personality might have triumphed
over party fealty. The interval between
the conventions and the election is rapidly
changing all this. Disappointed candi
dates have forgotten how their pride was
wounded aud are now working for their
former rivals. Some of the meu who a
month ago were disturbing elements will
never be heard of again, and as for the in
dependent candidates there is not the
slightest reason to believe that one will be
elected. The prospects of the party on
tue eve of an election have never been
more hopeful for six years than they are
now. The stupidity of nurturing internal
strife and thus jeopardizing the success of
the party has been made bo apparent that
there is little danger of its being repeated.
The idea of Mayor Davie tbat tbe Legis
lature should deal witb the tuberculin
test business, expressed in this column
last week, has borne fruit and the Council
has refused to pass the ordinance over
his Honor's veto. The matter will now go
to the Legislature and be so handled that
it will apply to all counties alike. This is
certainly the only just way to legislate in
this regard, as dairymen in this county
are compelled, through force of circum
stances, to purchase cows from other
counties. UndÂ«r the proposed ordinance
this could not be done except by notifying
the Inspector and having the animals
tested as soon as tney entered this county.
No vender would send animals on trial,
and no purchaser cnul-.i afford to bring
animals nere on speculation. This and
many similar conditions have convinced
the local lawmakers tbat any precau
tionary measure must be made applicable
to the whole State, so the matter will rest
for a couple of months. S. W. B.

Ceremonies.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 11.â Rev. M.
Linczser, D.D., was formally installed as

OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 11.â A peculiar
case of robbery was reported to the police
to-night in the 1600 block on Sixth street,
where a man named Wiliiam Smith has
reaided aloue for some time. He owns the
property and is known to have consider
able money. He went to San Francisco
lest night and has not yet returned. To
day neighbors saw a stranger in tlie house,
but thought, nothing of it until this even
ine, and as Smith did not return they
made an investigation.
They found the house had been broken
into and that a general ransacking had
taken place. An officer made a thorough
search, but as it was not known just what
was in the place there is no proof that
anything was taken. A few days ago
Smith is said to have stated that he had
$1300 in cash in the bouse, and his neigh
bors expect when he returns to learn that
this has gone.

908 Broadway, Oct. 11. 5
When the sun shone for the first time
upon tbe rich colors of the beautiful
American standard as it burst at the mast
head over St. .Francis de Sales this after
noon, a shout went up from full 10,000
throats.
The League of the Cross rally and fiag
raising of Company A of Oakland was
somewhat in the nature of a surprise. The
local people were not prepared to see such
an outpouring of cadets from across the
bay, and as they marched up Broadway
they made an admirable showing.
The first part of the ceremonies consisted
of an indoor entertainment in the large
hall.
The room had been tastefully decorated*
with red, white and blue bunting, while
draped about tbe platform were large
American flags. It was occupied by Revs.
Yorke, McSweeney, Cull, Butler, Cran
mell, O'Ryan, Scanlon, Hon. R. M. Fitz
gerald, T. F. Garritty, Messrs. J. J. Pow
ers, M. Pomer, F. P. Summers and F.
Wyras, D. J. Mahoney aud President of
the day *\ N. Hanrahan.
The programme was opened with the
chorus, "Veni Creator.'' D. J. Mahoney
gave a very interesting account of the
aims and objects of the league, in which
he said it knew no sect or creed, but was
working for tbe uplifting of mankind,
held down by the demou drink. After
this there were several entertainiug num
bers, which finished the opening exercises.
The First Regiment, League of the
Cross Caaets, from San Francisco, arrived
by the Creek route and marched up
Broadway at 2 o'clock. The boys were
taken into the armory, where a lunch was
served.
The companies of the regiment turned
out as follows:
St. Mary's Parish â Company A, Captain
Frank 6. Drady, Lieutenant William Hopper,
Lieutenant Robert Drady, seventy-five men.

Tbe regiment stood in battalion forma'
tion in fiont of the school building during
the ceremonies.
The exercises Depan with the "Star-
Spangled Banner," the first note of which
was the sienal for "Old Glory" to be unfurl
ed to the breeze from the flagstaff on the
school building. As it was unfurled a
shout went up from the great throng.
President of the Hay P. N. Hanrahan
gave a welcome to the audience, and in
troduced Peter C. Yorke of San Francisco
who spoke as follows:
We are gathered here this afternoon for the
patriotic ceremony of raising the American
flag over our school. The Catholics of this
country have not been behind those of any
sect or creed in support of the system of public
schools of this country. W,e pay our taxes
because we behove in keeping religion out of
them, whether it be Catholic or Protestant
We pay our money for our own schools so as to
De aDle to teach the youth jeligious principles.
The raising of the American nag over a Cath
olic school is no new thin^. The red stripes
represent the blood oi Catholics as well as
those of others. The white stripes and stars
reflect the patriotic deeds of Catholics as well
as those of Protestants. It is a good thing for
the city of Oakland and Alameda County in
this year 1896 to turn attention to the mean
ing of this flag. It is a flag of color and not of
darkness. It is not a flag of dark deeds or
dark-lantern societies. It is not afraid of the
light.
There Is a free library in this city supported
by the taxes of Catholics and Protestants.
The management has refused to allow two
papers to be in it because they let in light on
a society composed of moles, bats and night
owls. The librarian, named Peterson, says
they barred the papers because some one
wanted to have the American Patriot, daw
known as the American Standard When he
says the Monitor and Star were barred because
oi the de lire oi some one to introduce the A.
P. A. Standard he tells something that Is not
the trutn, and he knows it.
I hold here the documentary evidence to
show that the library had subscribed and paid
for the American Standard. The payment runs
to the month of June, 1895, and the paper hns
never been ordered stopped; and when the
librarian says the Monitor and Star were
stopped so as not to introduce the Standard he
does not tell the truth. The American Patriot
is the paper which insulted the Catholic
women and maligned the sisters in our con
vents. It is. meet and just to fling this glorious
banner to the wind, so that such people may
grovel in the dark and know that the flag
stands not for cowardice, but for liberty.
Hon. K. M. Fitzgerald was the second
speaker. He said:
It has been stated that we meet here for a
double purpose, to raise the stars and stripes,
the flag of our country, and to give our appro
bation to the motto on another banner â "Tem
perauce." Patriotism is a love of home and
country. Our country's flag stands for free
dom and religious liberty, and patriotism is
what causes us to pledge fealty and life if nec
essary to save it.
Thomas F. Garrity, the last speaker,
said in part :
The object nearest and dearest to the hearts
of the American people Is the betterment of
mankind. You are the architects of your own
future and you are building the temple well.
Youth nas hope, energy and enterprise and he
must keeo his enterprise and energy up if he
will maintain hope and realize his ambitions.
Never give up when circumstances are against
you.
A dress parade and review by the League
of the Cross Cadets followed, after which,
e without breaking ranks, they marched to
the creek boat and embarked for San
Francisco. The affair was in charge of a
committee consisting of Father T. Mc-
Sweeney, J. J. Power, M. R. Bronner and
F. P. Summers.
DR. PAYNE ON SUFFRAGE
Berkeley's Unitarian Pastor
Takes Up the Subj?ctfor
Discourse.
Giving a Series of Three Sunday
Morning Lecturesâ Berkeley
News Items.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. ILâ ReT. E. B.
Payne, pastor of the Unitarian Society of
Berkeley, has taken up the cause of
woman suffrage and is giving a course of
three Sunday-morning lectures on the
subject.
The first of tbe three was given this
morning. His general topic was, "Rela
tion of Woman to the Life and Work of
the World."
The remarks of Dr. Payne this morning
were confined to woman in her domestic
sphere. Next Sunday he will speak on
-woman in her relation to the larger life
and work of the world, and on the Sunday
following he will consider the rnpre special
subject of her part in public affairs.
Dr. Payne's announcement that he
would speak on the subject this morning
brought out an unusually large audience.
He said:
Tbe prime word for woman, as also for man,
is the Scripture saying-, "The word is nigti
thee." Listening woman has always beard
tbe words household and home. She always
will bear them and obey them. lam glad to
say this, because there are so many who ibink
that after November 3 there will be a complete
overturn of domestic order in the households
of Caliiornia. And this is what Miss Anthony
and her coadjutors are working for. There
fore, to steady the disturbed nerves of meu, I
say that women have a. ways heard these two
words, have obeyed them and always will.
For they have heard them for. their own
hearts.
But why have women undertaken the house
hold care and toil? Because they heard that
other word, home, which means far more.
This, rather than the mere delight in the work
of the housewife, makes them faithful to the
common task.
But they realize that the perfect home Can
not be secured by an outer and slavish devo
tion to the details oi household toil. This for
many women is the reason why they seek for
au expansion of their lives and work, that
they may better serve the home.
"Want Them Expelled.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 1L â There
promises to ba a lively time to-morrow
afternoon at the meeting of the asso
ciated students which President Elston
will call, when the mailer of expelling
from their body the Democrats who sent
resolutions condemning the recent action
of tbe Yale students toward Bryan comes
up for discussion. The Republicans at
tbe university are angry with the Bryan
men for sending out such resolutions as
coming from a part of the student body,
and their dragging the University into
politics. The same old question of whether
a man can be a university student and a
citizen at tbe same time will be brought up.
Thus far during the present campaign
the students have taken quite a prominent
part in politics, especially the representa
tives of the Students' Republican Club.
President Oliver of this club was, last
week, accused of speaking in public as a
representative of the university, and not
as a mere private citizen, but this accusa
tion proves to haye been groundless. Now,
the Democrats have, in a set of resolutions,
expressed their attitude toward the Yale
students, and forwarded them to Bryan
and to President Dwight of Yale. In them,
the name of the university is used, and it
is this point which the students will dis
cuss to-morrow.
Expulsion from the associated students
seems hardly probable, but the students
expect to settle once for all the propriety
and policy of connecting the university
wittf their political movements.

THOSE HISTORIC TREES.
To Be Planted Next MondayâSuperin
tendent McLaren's Idea-
More of the historic trees from the thir
teen original States of the Union, which
are to be planted in the valley in Golden
Gate Park where the Forty-nine Mining
Camp of the Midwinter Fair was located,
have been received at the park. There is
a red maple from Delaware, a birch from
Rhode Island, a linden from the grave of
Thomas Jefferson and a white oak from
the battlefield of Sarttoga, and the others
are expected within the next three or four
dayfe. These trees will be planted with
appropriate patriotic ceremonies next
Monday under the auspices of Sequoia
Chapter of the Daughters of the American
Revolution, of which chapter many of the
most prominent ladies of San Francisco
are members.
They are to be laid out in the shape of
an arch, with the tree from Pennsylvania
to represent the keystone, and six placed
equidistant on each aide of it. The stakes
showing where they will be located have
been driven by order of Superintendent
McLaren. On tbe outside of this arch
there will be planted a hedge and outside
of these a twelve-foot wide walk will be
laid out.
Tbe superintendent has an idea that the
spot would be made still more attractive
by planting witbin the arch thirty-two
additional trees, one irom each State ad
mitted into the Union, with a giant sequoia
to represent California. "And," said tbe
superintendent yesterday, "there is a pos
sibility tnat this will be carried into
effect.*'
REPEATED AFTER
THIRTY YEARS
First Sermon Delivered in
United Presbyterian
Church.
Three Decades, and Rev. M. M.
Gibson Still Watches Over
His Flock.
BUILDING UP A CHUKCH.
His Congregation Will Ba Joined by
Others in Celebrating the Grand
Jubilee.
Thirty years ago Rev. M. M. Gibson of
he United Presbyterian Church assumed
the pastorate of that place of worship in
this City.
He reached here on the second Sunday,
the 14th of October, 1866, on the old
steamer Constitution via Panama, when
the church was only a mission, which bad
Rev. M. M. Gibson, D.D.
been organized in January of that year.
He was sent here by the General Assem
bly of the United Presbyterian Church of
Pittsburg to take charge of the mission,
and he has been here ever since without
interruption, building up the congrega
tion from a handful of worshipers to the
powerful organization it is to-day.
In honor of the thirtieth anniversary of
Mr. Gibson's pastorate there is to be a
jubilee celebration lasting one week, be
ginning next Tuesday night at the beauti
ful church at the corner of Golden Gate
avenue and Polk street. On that evening
there will be a Christian Endeavor meet
ing, at which Rev. Dr. Rader of the Third
Congregational Church and Dr. Dille of
the Central Methodist Church will speak;
also Holla V. Watt and J. S. Webster will
be heard.
On Wednesday evening there will be a
thanksgiving offering dinner from 6 to 8
o'clock, giveu by the ladies of the congre
gation. Then there will be some alter
dinner speeches by the pastors of the City,
including Rev. Drs. Case and Mackenzie.
On Thursday night there will be a grand
vocal and instrumental concert
On Friday evening there will be a per
formance by the children of the three
Sabbath-schools attached to the church.
Last night Rev. Dr. Gibson, after thirty
years, delivered tbe same sermon he spoke
from the crude pulpit on tbe evenii he
assumed charge of the United Presbyterian
Mission.
The text of Rev. Mr. Gibson's first sermon
was from the Book of the Acts, x:29. "I
ask, therefore, for what intent ye have
sent for mer"
The theme was first taken up negatively,
the preacher Baying:
"It was not merely to tickle tbe ear and
please the fancy with rethoric and flight
of oratory, neither was it that I might
place myself on exhibition in the pulpit
every Sabbath morning.
"On the other hand, stated Mr. Gibson,
"I believe you sent for me to preach the
gospel of Jesus Christ; to expound the
Scriptures of the word of God so far as it
is given me ability to so do; to warn you
against error in practice as well as theory.
"While we are anxious to maintain cor
rect principles, it is necessary 'to know
how to carry them out, and this is what
you have wanted me for.
"You want me to comfort you in time
of sorrow, which comes to all in life, as
well as in time of sickness; also to set a
proper example to those under my care in
church life.
"On the other hand there are corre
sponding duties involved upon you who
have invited me to come.
"If you sent for me to preach the word
of life it is your duty to attend this preach
ing with diligence and consistency in the
bouse of God. It is the duty of those who
hear to meditate on the truths proclaimed
in order to practice what is heard. If you
do not meditate upon what you bear I do
not care how often you attend, for what
you hear must reach the wheels of ex
istence through meditation.
"It is expected that your pastor will re
ceive the hearty co-operation of his flock,
for two cannot walk together unless they
be agreed.
"It is the duty of a people who wait on
a pastor to pray for him, as the apostles
begged of the Christians to pray for them."

seem to h&ve confidence tbat all sanguine ex
pectations will be fully realized within reason
able time. Good judgment is being exercised
by buyers, and offerings are being canvassed
with critical eye, Wiiile there is no very
marked enthusiasm perceptible in realty cir
cles, there is a feelllng ot satisfaction and con
tent very evident among those who happen to
be possessed of more or less city proDerty.
There appears to be tacit admission that all
downward tendency has been checked aud
that a revival of activity of any consequence
must necessarily impart a stronger tone to
values.
LOANS BEING HADE.
Mngee's real estate circular for the month
has the following to say regarding the with
drawal of money from savings banks:
"The amount of money being lent on City
real estate is not large, while none at all is
now, nor has for a long time been lent in the
country. The Hibernia Bank charges 6% per
cent on the small loans it grants; the others
charge 7 when they grant any new loans,
which is seldom, or renew old loans, whicn
they invariably do, as they expire. They re
auire the old loan to be reduced if the value
of the real estate has fallen since it was
made. If it were now possible to get at the
facts it would be interesting to know how
many hundreds of thousands of dollars in all
have been lost to depositors at our savings
banks by the withdrawal of their deposits.
The money they drew has since in nearly every
case lain idle. Never could depositors gener
ally less afford to waste money ; never in the
history of our savings banks have thay wasted
so much as this year, by foolish withdrawals.
They will all, we think, soon appreciate their
lolly in this matte*. To tell them now of it
would be useless. Experience is the only file
that will cut eye teeth, and they have been
rubbed by savings batik depositors against
that file very severely for the last six months."

The Supreme Court held, in an opinion
handed down last week, that the section of
the Penal Code making the "obtaining of prop
erty by false and fraudulent representations"
a crime, does not apply to one who obtains
real property by ialse and fraudulent repre^
sentations. A certain Cummings was arrested
for having obtained two parcels of land by
false pretenses, and *he trial Court sustained
the demurrer to the complaint on the ground
that no offense was charged. The Suoreme
Court holds that the language of the codeâ
"any money, goods, wares, merchandise or
other property"â infers "property of that de
scription,"" ana as real property is not the sub
ject of larceny, obtaining real estate by false
pretenses is no offense uuder the code.

NATIONAL GUARD
OF CALIFORNIA.
The banquet at the California Hotel this
evening in honor of General Graham,
U. S. A., is the event of the hour in Na
tional Guard circles In San Francisco.
The suggestion to give a farewell dinner
in honor of the distinguished officer met
with universal favor, and so the attend
ance of active and retired officers will be
unusually large. The first intention was
to give tne banquet at the Bohemian Club,
as tbe leading officers of the Fifth Artil
lery are members of that institution, but
the prospect of an attendance much larger
than was originally intended induced the
committee of arrangements to secure tbe
large banquet-hall of the California Hotel.
Among those who ha-e signified a desire
to be present are officers of the staff of the
Commander-in-Chief (Governor Budd),
Major-General N. T. James and staff,
Brigtrtiier-Genfra! Warfield and stafY and
Colonel William Macdonald and staff.
Among well-known officers on the re
tired list who will be there are General
John H. Dickinson, Colonel George W.
Granniss and Colonel H. P. Bush. Twenty
or more officers of the United States army,
belongine chiefly to the Fifth Artillery,
will be present.
The division staff has been re-enforced
by the appointment of Lieutenant-Colonel
Thomas A. Nerney, formerly of the Sev
enth Infantry, to the position of inspector
of rifle practice. Colonel Nerney is a pro
gressive officer, who has had long experi
ence in the National Guard.
Captain Carrington. First Infantry,
United States army, who is serving on the
staff of Governor Budd as inspector of the
National Guard of this State, is preparing
his report for the War Department. The
report will be forwarded to the Secretary
of War before November 1.
In his line of duty Captain Carrineton
has visited nearly every organization of
tbe Guard in California. He is a capable
officer who understands his business. It
is believed that he will speak his mind
freely regarding tbe weak points in the
organization.
Second Brigade.
The Officers' Association of the Second
Brigade will hold another meeting to
morrow evening. Since the meeting that
created the association was held members
of the campaign committee have inter
viewed many candidates for the Legisla
ture to ascertain the sentiments regarding
appropriations for the Guard. The com
mittee is composed of Lieutenant-Colonel
Victor Duboce. Major C. L. Tilden and
Captains Thomas F. O'Neil, I>. A. Smith
an<f George FUmer.
Officers express the hope that the First
and Third Brigales will form associa
tions similar to this one recently organ
ized inttie Second Brigade. Tne purpose
of entering into politics is disavowed, but
the position is taken that candidates for
the Legislature should be informed as to
the requirements of the National Guard,
so thai when they get to Sacramento and
settle down to the work of appropriating
public money they will know what amount
the State troops should be allowed. Up
on the line of the Donahue railroad the
Fiith Infantry skirmishers have captured
all the candidates for the Legislature.
A meeting of tne board of officers of the
First Infantry was held at the regimental
armory last Thursday evening. Colonel
Macdonald is anxions to have a regimental
field day and a committee has been ap
pointed to select grounds for the outing.
It ie proposed that the regiment shall
start from the armory with one day's ra
tions and have a series of company and
battalion drills. The silhouette targets
will be taken along for rifle practice.
There is talk in tbe regiment of the
proposition to secure a rifle-range on the
peninsula. The trip across the bay is in
convenient, and takes more time than the
men can give. The reeiment has secured
from the State a set of tools for loading
shells. This may bring about an improve
ment in tbe ammunition, and perhaps re
sult in the saving of money. An effort is
to be made to get Lieutenant Barrere, the
inspector of rifle practice, to assume the
responsibility of charging the shells, or at
least have the duty performed under his
direction.
Companies C and G bad an agreeable
anniversary party at the Ellis-street
armory last Friday evening. Many ladies
who were present were cordially enter
tained.
Company X, Captain Thomes J. Cun
ningham, had a successful outing at
Guadalupe ranch. The meat-ration cans
recently issued to the State troops were
found to be very convenient and service
able.
Company F, Captain John A. Miller,
went to Stockton for an annual outing and
returned last Tuesday, highly delighted
with the trip and tbe Stockton welcome.
Third Brigade. *
MERCED, Cal., Oct. B.â Company H,
Sixth Infantry, attended the celebration
of the arrival of the San Joaquin Valley
Railroad into Fresno last Monday at the
invitation of the citizens' committee
of that place. The company went
down about forty strong, leaving
Merced at 11 o'clock. The train was
somewhat delayed and did not arrive
in Fresno until after 1 o'clock. The com
pany was lined up in the sun, where they
bad to stand for quite awhile until the
barbecue was ready. After the meal was
finished they were again compelled to
stand in the broiling sun for some time.
They were finally marched to the armory
and dismissed, with orders to fall in In
about half an hour for a review and dress
parade before the Governor. The train re
turned at 7P. m. The Fresno Guardsmen
treated the boy? in their u-^ual hospitable
manner, but the experience of the day
was the same old story that is enacted
every time tbe troops are invited away
for parade duty. The committee bad
made no arrangements for the comfort of
the men whatever. The Merced company
was under arms awaiting orders nearly all
the time >t was in the city and the boys
had only a little over an hour to them
selves. The company is always willing to
turn out on sncii occasions and do its best
to help a celebration aiong, but the men
do not consider they are being treated
right when they have no time to them
selves. The only way for the committee
in charge of these celebrations to learn
this fact is for the boys to decline all in
vitations that are not accompanied by a
guarantee that some consideration will be
given to tbe comfort and enjoyment of
the soldier. The officers and the men of
vhe Sixth Regiment in Fresno have the
hearty thanks of all the visiting com
panies for the kind treatment and hearty
w-lconie extended.
VISALIA, Cal., Oct. 7.â Company E, as
usual, made a fine appearance at Fresno
last Monday in honor of Clans Spreckels
and the Valley road. Of them the Fresno
Republican says:
Then came Company E of Visalia, under
command of Captain Ward. Out of a total en
rollment of sixty-four fifty-three attended,
which was a very good percentage considering
that It was not compulsory upon them to at
tend. The Visalians brought a band with
them, ana good music it m de, too. Besides
its Guards Tulare's capita! s at up 100 of its
most prominent citizens. The delegation was
full of handsome men and tney were greeted
with many admiring glances from bright eyes.
At the last meeting it was decided to put
up four medals for the best four marks
men during the year 1897. Corporal Ren
ick at the regular monthly shoot won the
champion and the A class medals, score 44.
Last Monday, after some little delay,
the parade at Fresno was started. After a
great many short stops the soldiers, wbn
were marching in sixteen-file fronts, won
dered at the cause. Governor Budd finally
called his orderly, saying: "Present my
compliments to Marshal Berry and ascer
tain the cause of so many delays." The
grand marshal of the day said: "Return my
compliments, and when them blanket/
soldiers will close up Â»nd not scatter from
one side of the street to the other this pro
cession will move on without any trouble."
The 500-yard bulkhead is the attraction
now, and the boys are expecting in a snort
while to make a showing.
Next Tuesday evening the Major Berry
med.il will be drilled for.
Company E is now guaranteed a large
attendance at its coming dance on Friday
evening, October 16.
Adjutant-General Barrett may visit Com
pany E on his return from the south.
WOODLAND, Cal., Oct. 9.â The State
shoot oJ Company F for decorations will
take place on the 10th of the pr. sent
month at the range in Woodland. From
the present outlook every man of Com
pany F will take part. The membership
of Company F is on the increase and the I
men whose terms are expiring, with a few '
exceptions, are re-enlisting. Last Wednes
day eveiiine four new men were sworn in
and the chances are very favorable that as
many more will be sworn in during the
present wees.
Tne camp of Companies F and Gof the
Second Infantry was a success in every
particular. The military bearing of the
men was excellent and every one who
visited the camp was loud in praises of [
the officers and men.
On Saturday morning the men of both
companies were marched to the tuies east j
of town, about three miles and a nail, for j
target practice, lliis consisted of squads ;
of ion men commencing firing at 700
yards and then advancing in runs of 100
yards and tiring three shots until within j
200 yards of the targets; every man hay- i
ing a group of thre- targets to fire at â ;
one standing, one kneeling and one lying
down, the three sbocs to be fired in thirty
seconds.
Company F made the best score in
every tarticular; that is, in squads and ,
individual scores. After the practice the
men were marched back. It was a little '
Hard on the boys, but they dil tneir work
like regulars, and in the evening went
through dress parade as though they
hadn't been out. of camp at ali. Sunday
tne men were awakened at 6:15 by the
morning gun and the sound of bugles. At |
9 o'clock guard mount was gone through â¢
with for two nours. The i fficers and men
executed this beautiful Â»nd most import- j
ant branch of miluary service in a vfiry ',
creditable manner. At 2:10 o'clock camp i
was broken, anu Company F escorted
Company G to the depot, where it took
the afternoon train for Sacramento. As
the train was pulling out hearty cheers ;
were given for Colonel Guthrie, Captain i
Steams, Captain Prindle, Companies F j
and G and the Second Infantry in general. |
Captain Steams, who was the command- !
ing officer during the camp, is to be highly \
complimented upon the efficient manner
in which every detail was carried out. He
is a strict disciplinarian, and is reputed to
be the best tactician in the State. He was
ably assisted by Capcain Prindle and the
lieutenants of both companies. Colonel
Guthrie complimented the men very
highly, and was very well pleased.
The signal corps, mounted, was also in
camp. It arrived Sunday morning about
2:30. The mounted drill at 9 o'clock Sun
day morning was witnessed by a large
crowd of citizens, a great many of them j
old soldiers, and the corps was high.y
complimented upon its efficiency.
The monthly socials to be given by Com
pany F through the winter months will
commence next Thursday evening, Octo- '
ber 15, at ihe Armory. All military men i
are cordially invited to attend these so
cials. They are to be strictly military in
every sense of the word. Members of the
Guard and military men in general are ex
pected to wear the.'r uniforms.
Tbe complimentary social given by tbe j
company on the first of the present month j
was conceded by all who attended to be i
one of the finest and best conducted par
ties ever piven in this city. The company I
is patiently waiting for some of the higher
officials of the Guard to make their ap
pearance on some one of the regular drill
nights. The company is prepared at any
and all times to have them come. The
regular drill night is Wednesday.
TWO CRICKET MATCHES.
Some Good Batting Done Both
at Golden Gate and San
Jose.
Alamedas and Pacifies Victorsâ All
Is In Readiness for the Aus
tralians.
Two interesting if not over-close cricket
matches were played yesterday. One was
between the Bohemian and Alameda teams
at Golden Gate and resulted in a defeat for
the champions of the year, the Bohemians,
by 49 runs.
Going first to bat, the Alamedas topped
the two-century mark by 10 runs. The
innings of young Ward, .who put up a
meritorious 59, and of the ever-reliable
Teddy Hood, were the : features of the in
nings. /
The innings being called at the fall of,
the ninth wicket, Bowhill and Sheath
opened for the Bohemians. The latter and
Moriarty, who followed, both scored rap
idly. Then Robertson went in and en
deavored, by keeping bowling, to play
out time and make a draw. He scored 70
not out himself, and so. nearly accom
plished his purpose that when the last
wicket fell there lacked just two minutes
of call time; hence the above result. There
were two gallery catches, one by Sloman,
the other by Peel. The latter, a drive re
turn â "; of i. Moriarty 's, severely injured .1 the
catcher and may incapacitate him for the
Australian match on Wednesday. The
score:

STOCKTONS OUTBATTED.
Imperials Easily Defeat the Ball Play
.. ; ers From the Mill City.
"I believe the Imperials have rung in a
rubber ball," remarked a disgusted Stock
ion rooter yesterday in the second inning
when ' the ; local.players -i were â  busily en
gaged in lining out base hits. -' -i *"â â¢>â¦-â 
It certainly > looked that way. During
that one inning the Imperials sent f twelve
men to bat, eight of whom 'hit safely, one
of them for two bases and one for three.
The result nine runs, immense
lead effectually dampened the ardor of the
visitor* and reduced the game' to an unin
teresting endeavor to complete the re
quired number of innings. .
: The crowd in attendance was the best of
the season ; since t the opening day. 1 A
traihloaa of enthusiasts accompanied the
Mill City men and pulled hard for their
favorites, but to no avail. '-, After the fatal
second inning one of ; them remarked: "I
think the Stocktons are playing a dirty
trick on ;, the Imperials. They are try in
to tire them out by running them around
the bases. Later on they'll beat them."
Then the , speuker picked a quarrel with
himself and subsided. '
The enlivening features of the third and
succeeding innings were Nick Smith's ap
parent effort to lose the ball when throw
ing from second ;to home and the en
deavors of the Imperials to disable the
visiting catcher. They evidently did not
find the Stockton pace hot enough for them
and; sought to warm him up. They suc
ceeded in spiking him â hitting him with
a pitched ball and injuring two of his
thumbs, and besides the umpire called
him out on eveiy close decision. It was
certainly not his lucky day.
Kelly* had excellent control of the ball
and allowed his opponents but six hits.

CHURCH PEACE.
Dr. Jefferson, Dean of tbe University
Bible Annex, Preaches Here.
The Rev. S. M. Jefferson, D.D., the dean
of the Bible seminary in connection with
the State University, preached yesterday
morning ut the First Christian Church.
Dr. Jefferson but recently arrived on the
Pacific Coast from Virginia, :ind this was
his first service in San Francisco.
He preached on the subject of "Founda
tion of Church Growth in Reality," and
drew au analogy between the ancient
church, resting and progressing during a
brief respite from her persecutions, and
hi* own church in this, the most favor
able period of her hiÂ«tory. The earlier
days of the church society organized by
Alexander Campbell and called by him
the Christian church was a time of war
fare with the older societies. But it kept
its place and progress with the pace of
Christianity. 'Sow in its rest it should
walK, like the churches throughout Judea
and Galilee, in the fear of the Lord and
tlie comfort of the Holy Ghost, aud mul
tiply.

CORBETT DECLINES
TO FIGHT SHARKEY
There Is Not Enough in It
for Him to Meet the
Sailor.
He Says That This State Is hut
a Very Small Part of the
Country.
HE WILL NOT COME HERE.
The East Wants Him to Fight Fi'z
simmons and the Venture Will Be
More Profitable.
Corbett's long-expected letter in regard
to his attitude in the premised fight with
Sharkey was received here yesterday.
â¢'lt's all off," dejectedly stated Dan
Lynch when he glanced over the two
pages of typewritten matter. "The cow
ard has flunked, as I thought he would. '"
He then handed the letter over to Shar
key, and between the two, with the assist
ance ot Jim Groom, they managed to read
the champion's decision.
Following is a copy of Pompadour Jim's
strange deductions :
New York, October 6. 1896. "
Mr. Dan Lynch, care Groom's Hat Store, Bald
win Hotel. San Francisco, Cal. â Dear Sir: I
â wired you to Denver calling my match with
Shnrkey off, and 1 received a very impertinent
telegram from you in reply. 1 have bi-en train
ing down ai Astmry Park for five weeks, and
Mr. Fitzsimmons aud Mr. Sharkey are both on
the road niukiug money. Neither one of them
would make a cent it it were not for the fact
that they Â«re traveling on my name. How
ever, I \vas perfectly willing to do this at the
time as the clubs in Frisco offered purses that
â were satisfactory to me. They agreed lo put
up the money at a certain time, and Mr. Law
reuce of the "Examiner knows that 1 was ready
to start as soon as they pu: the money up.
However, they did not stick to their" agree
ment, and I gave them until a certain time to
put up their guarantee. They failed to do
this, and 1 called the match off. and went right
ahead and made other arrangements.
Now, Mr. Lynch, it is just like this. There
seems to be no interest in Sharkey outside of
California, which is a small part of this coun
try. Everyone wants me to right Fitzsimmons
and as thai is where the interest is centered,
and not seeing any chance if 1 beat Sharkey to
make more than $"4000 or $5000, 1 cannot see
(as a business man.) why 1 >hould come out
there and box him for such a paltry sum. In
the first place, ray contract wiih Sharkey is a
finish fight for $10,000 a side and there was
a purse offered ot $20,000. As soon as 1 made
a match with Fitzsimmuns it has dropped to
$10,000.
It will cost me $3000 to bring my trainers
out there and train, so there is no use wasting
any ta.k or time. 1 will not fight Sharkey at
present. Fitzsimmons is the man lam ambi
tious to meet, and I will attend to Sharkey
afterward providing the inducements suit
me.
Hoping you will look at this in a business
like way, I remain yours truly,
James J. Corbett.
Corbett's attitude in this Sharkey affair
has excited much comment among the
patrons of pugilism. It is believed now
that Jim is positively afraid of meeting
defeat if he goes against the sailor.
Jim sees no wav of getting more than
fSOOO out of the affair if he wins, and he
claims it will cost him that amount to
come here with his retinue and train. Is
it then that he and Sharkey humbugged
the public here when they ciaimed to
have deposited $5000 each as a forfeit in
t c hanus of Danny filler at the time of
signing articles?
The National Athletic Club has put up
$6000 cash as a first deposit on a $10,000
purse, and with the $10,000 Corbett,
Lynch, Shansey and Miller ciaimed was
put up by the fighters themselves, Cor
bett, if a winner, certainly could draw
down a snug pot of money, far surpassing
even such extravagant expenditures for
an overland trip as $5000.
Sbarkey was very much put out after
hearing Corbett's letter read to him.
"He's a dirty cur; he don't want to meet
me. I have had Groom telegrap-h to Fitz
simmons that I will fight him for $10,000 a
Bide and ten rounds. I'll tight any man
in the world â black, white or blue; I bar
no color, size or weight. If i can force
CorDett to meet me I'll bet $5000 on the
side he'll not be on his feet in ten rounds. 1 '
A casual remark made by a bystander to
the effect that Sharkey would have to
swim Cavill, the Australian, a match
across the Golden Gate, brought forth the
pleasant retort:
"There's another guy. He wants to
make money off my name. I; he comes at
me with a challenge to swim I'll punch
him in the jaw. I'm no swimmer; I'm a
fighter."
He Felt of ilia Pockets.
Joseph Leieveier, a fisherman, through his
curiosity to ascertain what A. J. Brower, whom
be found asleep on a doorstep on Dupont
street, had in his pockets, caused Officer J. B.
Cavanaeh, who saw him In the act oi explora
tion, to arrest him for grand larceny. Brower
regrets the absence ot a gold watch, but the
ticker was not found on the person of Le-
Icveier when searched at the California-street
station.

M. GREENWOOD IS DEAD

He Was a Pioneer and Carved Out

State Was Young.
Monroe Greenwood, president of the
California Electrical Works and vice-presi

at Kan Mateo. Mr. Greenwood had been
ill for about a week, but yesterday his
condition was considered much improved
until, with scarcely a moment's warning,
the end came. His demise is attributed
to heart failure.
Mr. Greenwood was born at Dublin,
Miss., and was 68 years of age. He came
to California in 1851, and has been promi
nently associated with the business life of
this City since that time.
He was practically without means when
he arrived here, but by enterprise and

Mr. Greenwood had been connected with

sons, F. A. and George D. Greenwood, are
occupying responsible positions in the

DIED AT 12:07
BY THE WATCH
Hack-Driver Kinney Found
Dead and Floating in
the Bay.
WATCH FULL OF WATER
He Was Last Seen at Midnight
Going Toward His Lodging-
House.
MYSTERIOTJS CIBCUM9TANCES.
His Purse Is Missing and There Is a
Strange Blonde Woman
' in the Case-
The body of A. J. Kinney, a well-known
hack-driver, familiarly called "Johnnie,"
was found in the slip of Mission-street
dock 2 yesterday morning at 7:50 o'clock.
Several mysterious circumstances Â»nr
round his death.
Kinney had been a bacKdriver in the
City about ten year 3 and was a familiar
figure at the ferries, Third and Townsend
streets and downtown stands. He owned
his own carriage and team, dressed in
livery, was quiet, well behaved and did
not drink to excess. Knowing his steady
habits, all his friends are mystified at his
sudden death! Its suddenness is well
illustrated by the fact that one of the
men, W. H. Horn, who played shuffle-
John Kinney.
board Saturday night with him in Cogh
lin's saloon at 1430 Market street, and is
employed by the San Francifco Under
taking Company, yesterday afternoon em
balmed the body of his friend and com
panion of the night before and prepared it
for burial.
Saturday night County Clerk Curry, his
deputy, Harry Piper, Frank Corbett of
the San Francis.co Undertaking Company,
Harry Corbett and several others were in
Cogniin's saloon. They talked politics
and other things and played shuffle- board.
About 11 o'clock Johnnie Kinney and a
friend, J. M. Ferris, a silver-plater who
lives out in the Potrero, left the saloon to
go home. Kinney drank a little periodi
cally, and was somewhat under the influ
ence of liquor when Ferris left him at
Third and Howard streets, about 11:30
o'clock. Ferris says the last he saw of
Kinney was when the latter walked across
the street toward the Koster lodging
house at 205 Third street, where he
roomed.
Ferris then caught a car and went home.
Nobody has yet been found who saw Kin
ney after this till his dead body was
found in the water. Shortly before 8
o'clock J. C. ParKer of the little steamer
Belvedere noticed the body floating in the
slip, and Edward Casey, a runner for the
New Western Hotel, assisted him in tying
it to the piling, when the Coroner's office
was notitifd.
There are several scratches on the face
and the end of the nose is skinned, but it
is thought these abrasions were made by
contact with the piling.
The question which puzzles the dead
man's friends is Kinney's whereabouts
after 11:30 o'clock. Some think he was
drugged and robbed; others that he wan
dered down Mission street, Jell into the
water and being hravily intoxicated was
unablo to help himself. There io one fact
which supports the latter theor â¢ It is that
Kinney's silver watch was full oi water
and it stopped at exactly 12:07 o'clock,
giving him time enough toiwander slowly
down Mission or Howard streets from
Third to the wharf.
On the other hand Michael W. Kinney,
the dead man's brother, snys he carried
from $15 to $30 in a purse. When the body
was recovered only 2 cents were in the
pockets ami the purse was missing.
Jack Marshall, a hack-driver, throws a
little more mystery into the case by mak
ing the statement that de saw Kinney
around the ferries at G o'clock yesterday
morning. But if that is so how did the
watch get filled with water at 12:07 in the
morning, his friends would like to
know.
There also appears to be a woman in the
case. She is iot known to have been with
Kinney Saturday night. She is blonde
and fair. Friday morning she went to
the ferries to meet some friends. They
failed to appear, and Kinney took her
home in his carriage and made her ac
quaintance.
He told several of his friends among the
haefc-drivers that he had an engagement
with the woman Saturday night and that
she seemed to be a lady. It is not known
whether he kept this tngagement or not.
Kinney was always well dressed and was
rather a good-looking fellow. He was
about 42 years of age and was born in Wis
consin. He roomed with his brother. The
circumstances so far as known were re
ported to Captain Lees and he put Detec
tives Cody and CrocKett on the case.
R. E. Cole, liveryman on Third street,
where Kinney kept his horses and car
riage, said Kinney came in about 6 o'clock
Saturday night, about two hours earlier
than usual.
It was also learned by a Call reDorter
that Kinney had a drink about 7 o'clock
with a stran.er at Ackerson's saloon at
Third and Howard. The bartender was
not able to give a description of this man.
Tlie autopsy on the body, performed by
Dr. Charles L. Morgan, demonstrated the
fact that the lungs were tull of water and
that the immediate cause of death was
submersion. No liquor was found in the
stomach.
Kinney was a stockholder in the Union
Undertaking Company on Mission street.
He will be buried under the auspices of
Lodge No. 34 of the Young Men's Insti
tute.
A DAY OF PLEASURE.

This was followed by a grand chorus,
"Willkommen-Gruss," by 300 voices, un
der the leadership of Professor H. Kaen

DIVINE REMEDY FOR SIN.
Text of the Sermon by the Key. Dr.
Spauldtng.
The Rev. Dr. Spaulding's sermon in St.
John's Episcopal Church yesterday was
upon "Sin, Its Consequences and the Di
vine Remedy." The healing of the man
with palsy suggested' the subject. The
rector called attention to the fact that the
Lord's answer to the palsied man, "Thy
sins be forgiven thee," would be meaning
less unless sin was the cause of the disease,
and then dwelt upon the physical and
moral results of sin. He said that there is
the slow suicide of bad habits and of evil
passions as well as the sudden ending of
life by pistol or poison. The moral re
sults, he said, are still more dreadful in a
lowered tone ot living, in the conscious
ness of being apart from God. which
means wretched restlessness. Forgive- j
,ness of sins of which the Master left the j
privilege in his church to speak for him
is the only cure for this wretched restless
ness.
