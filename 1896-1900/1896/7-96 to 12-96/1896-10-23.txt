VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 145.
SIX DELEGATIONS
MARCH TO CANTON
Virtually Ohio Day at the
Home of the Next
President.
Thousands of Voters Journey
Many Miles to Show Loyalty
to Major McKinley.
AMERICANS DEMAND HONESTY.
They Will Show by Their Ballots
That Law and Order Must
Prevail.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 22.â Major McKin
lev made six speeches to-day. Five of the
delegations were from Ohio and one from
the adjoining Sate of Indiana. The Ohio
people were ?o numerous and so enthu
siastic that Major McKinley told them
this might properly have been called Ohio
day. The weather was delightful. Major
McKinley, recognizing the fact that the
arguments are all in, made his speeches
shorter, crisp and inspiring. They in
" spired generous and at times tumultuous
applnuse.
The first delegation was from Creston,
"Wayne County, Ohio. It came at 10:30.
and numbered about 300, Major McKin
]ey's response to the spokesman's address
was brief and happy. He spoke on the
twin issues of protection and sound money.
A delegation from Medina County, Ohio,
numbering more than 1000, called at 12:30.
There were bands and a good glee club
with it, which sang popular and campaign
airs while the Ibrong was marching into
Major McKinley's yard. The delegation
was an enthusiastic one and gave Major
McKinley a rousing reception when he
rose to speak. He said that he liked the
remarks of Professor M. F. Warner, the
spokesman of the delegation, who is presi
dent of the Baldwin University and who
had stated that be was a life-long Demo
crat who felt it his duty to vote the Re
publican ticket this year.
"This is not a partisan campaign," be
said. "It rises altogether above that. It
is a campaign, as I view it, for the United
States, its honor, its credit, its currency,
its welfare, and 1 welcome the assistance
which comes lo our cause from every quar
ter of the conntry, from men who hereto
fore have not been identified with U3 ie
party associations. Professor Warner is a
good enough Republican for me this year
[laughter], and he does not stand alone
[cries of "No, no"], for in every State of
the Union there are good old-fashioned
Democrats who love their country's honor
and esteem it more highly than they do
any political association, no matter how
long they have been members of it, and
they are with us in this contest for the
public honor. I am glad to meet the
young men from the college of Berea. I
am glad in this contest we can suDinit our
principles to the educated men of the
United Stales and I rejoice that in every
college of the country, East and West,
where a poll has been taken a large ma
jority is always found in favor of finan
cial integrity and the National honor.
''Some people seem to think that the
way to enrich this country is to coin the
silver of the world at the ratio of 16 to 1.
Well, if 16 to 1 is a good thing 32 to 1 is
better, for 32 to 1 better expresses the
commercial relation between gold and
Bilver than 16 to 1. If we are to coin silver
in dollars you want to put enough in
every dollar to make it 100 cents every
where, so that the dollar will not cheat
anybody, either a public or a private
creditor. But, my friends, there is more
involved in this campaign than the ques
tion of currency. There is the question of
whether this is to be a government by law
â whether the law is to be supreme over
all, whether the courts ol this country,
which are a sheet-anchor for us in every
time of trouble, are to be su&iained or to
become the mere creatures of a party cau
cus. Awavwithit! [Applause.] This is
a Government . by law and the people will
render a verdict on the 3d day of Novem
ber sustaining both law and courts."
From BarnesTille, Belmont County, and
some smaller towns in the neighboring
counties of Noble and Guertney, the next
delegation came. It was made up of
workingmen, farmers and miners, and it
numbered nearly a thousand. Major Mc-
Kinley said:
"I taKe it the people about me, at least
those who can hear my voice, are opposed
to debasing the money of the country.
Every man, whether he has much money
or little, wants it good. He wants a
money stable in value, uncorrupted and
uncorruptible; a money that will be
worth 100 cents on every dollar, whether
be keens it or paris with it, whether he
receives it iv pnyment for labor or for
farm products, or pays it to the merchant
or the banker. I think that no man in
Ohio wants the obligations of the United
States dishonored to the extent of a single
farthing. We have fought this battle
over and over again. The Democratic
party, or one wing of it, at least, once de
clared that we must repudiate the bonds
of the United States, but the Republicant
parly said No, these bonds were issued to
nave" the flag of the country, and every
dollar must be paid in as good currency as
the world Jcnows.' And we paid off under
that policy more than two-thirds of that
great National debt?
The Barnesville delegation was closely
followed by a great one from Marietta,
Ohio, which included some visitors from
Morgan County. The Marietta delegation
coming from the liist settlement in the
whole Northwest Territory and a country
rich in historical associations and BUgges
i tions caused Major McKinley to recall
â¢ some scenes, incidents and events of the
A Past. Then he said:
\ "Our honor is impugned, our currency
is threatened, our courts are assaulted, the
very fabric of our Government is involved
in the controversy which we must settle
one week from next Tuesday. This is not
a partisan contest; it is a contest b nil
upon genuine patriotism and looking to
genuine Americanism. No danger can
The San Francisco Call
ever come to this Republic so long as we
carry the American flag in our hands aiul
keep it in our hearts, and I speak to all
mv fellow-citizens of Ohio when I say that
this is the year when you are to determine
each for himself whether or not he wants
a 50-cent dollar or a 100-cent dollar,
whether or not he wants a return to that
prosperity from which he ran away in
1892, or whether or not he wants to con
tinue that industrial policy which in
creases debts of the Government and
debts for the people and want and denti
tion for all of us. [Cries of "We want
prosperity and we want McKinley."]
"The Republican party stands for an
honest dollar; for the maintenance of the
public honor; for sustaining the public
faith; for sustaining incorruptible the
courts of the country and for proclaiming
to all the world that this is a Government
of law [applause], and that the law must
be supreme above all. In this great con
test the Republican party has been desig
nated to carry the banner that represents
those great principles, and men of air
political parties this year are rallying
around that banner, because it embraces
what they beiiev9 to be the highest good
of the people and the glory of the Repub
lic."
Not one-third of the Marietta people bad
moved away wl.en a delegation of 700
from Guernsey County marched before
the stand where Major McKinley had been
speaking and which he had not left. Major
McKinley said:
"I am one of those who believe that the
majority of the citizens of this country
no matter what may have been their
political relations in the past â are inter
ested in achieving for the country its
highest prosperity snd the well being of
the people. I believe there have been a
great many people who honestly believe
that the free coinage of the silver of the
world might De a good thing, but after full
investigation of the subject, are satisfied
it would be altogether the wrong thing.
The Americans want no dishonesty in
their Government; they want no dishonest
standards of value; they want no false
weights, false measures, false values
or false economy. Now, I think the people
of-this country believe that we ought to
have a protective tariff high enough to
raise money to run the Government and
keep it out of debt; high enough to keep
American siiops running and American
workingmen employed [cheer*]; and high
enough to preserve the home market, the
best market in the world, to the American
farmer and agriculturist."
The last delegation of the day came
from Indiana, and arrived just before
dusk. It was composed of enthusiastic
Republicans from Fort Wayne, Valparaiso,
Plymouth and Stark County. Major Mc-
Kinley said:
"We want to see to it, as citizens of this
country, that the grand civilization that
we enjoy and tLe splendid free institutions
which we have inherited shall not be per
mitted to suffer/ least of all to suffer at
our hands. A government of the people
which rests npon the consent of the gov
erned is a government that can be made
by the people to express just such policies
as they beiicve will best subserve their
own interest?. You will have an opportu
nity one week Irom next Tuesday to ex
press dt your individual ballots what you
think of the great questions that divide
us this year. They are questions which
ought not to be troublesome in rightfai
determination. The question as to whether
good money or poor money is wanted
should not create doubt in any mind.
"We want good money â pood at home
and good abroad and good all the time â
and when we have parted with our work
and labor or our products We want sorae
tbing in return of staple value, and this is
the kind of money we have now â gold,
silver ami paper, all alike, all equal in pur
chasing and debt-paying power, made
good by the Government of the United
States. It is now proposed that we shall
open oar mints to the free coinage of the
silver of the world. How is the work
ingman to get any profit out of it? The
only vray he can get profit is by hi* labor.
If you should coin all the silver in the
world yon could not get any profit from it.
The trouble is not with tha money; it is
that we want something to do. It is the
lost job we want back. [Cries of 'Right!']
I know the people of Indiana are in favor
of law and order and of honest money.
[Cries of 'And of Major McKinley.' | You
are in favor of good money, good times
and good markets. You know how you
lost some of them and you know the
direct route to get them back again, and
if you do not follow in that way I shall be
very much surprised."

WASHINGTON, D. C., Oct. . 22.â 1t
seems certain the Republicans will be
able to command a . clear majority' in the
Senate 1 for the i passage of .a: tariff ,â¢ bill.
The present Senate stand nominally forty
four Republican, thirty-nine Democrats
and six Populists. The problem would bo
simple enough for Republicans if it in
volved only ; adding â  one or ; two
Senatorial seats, to the number they
now claim. ; The difficulty is 1 that ; sev
eral Senators counted as Republicans are
out for Bryan, and are not likely to act in
future in -Republican caucuses or in sup
port of Republican measures. .Taking the \
old figure* as : a basis ol > calculation Re
publicans have already made gains in two
States by choosing Foraker in Ohio and
Wellington in Maryland as the successors
of Bryceand GiDson in the Senate -which
meets next March. The Republicans are
substantially certain to choose â . Senators
in New York and Wisconsin 1 as successors
to Hill and Vllas. ; These gains alone
would carry their strength up to forty-'
eight, and give them a majority of six,,
if it were not for the silver bolters. -i i
The Republicans hope to gain also the
seats now held by Kyle of South ; Dakota,
Palmer of Illinois. Peffer of ..Kansas and
Voorhees of .Indiana. Their advices lead
them to believe that they will carry-all
these States except Kansas. , The \ tight
there is extremely close, and nothing, but
the brilliancy of Senator Ingalls,;with his
occasional concessions } to silver, ' gives the
Republicans any chance of winning.
Counting out all these seats but Kansas
for the Republicans would raise their
normal strength to fifty-one. This would
be a majority of twelve, if the silver Sena
tors could be counted upon; ,but Teller of |
Colorado, Dubois > t of Idiho, , Pettigrew ; of â¢
South Dakota, Cannon of lJ tab,; Mantle of
Montana and Squire of * Washington are
openly, for Bryan and free silver. Their
loss reduces the < Republican strength to
forty-five, just half of the Senate. There are
two other chances of electing Republican
Senators in Delaware ( and ; Kentucky. A

a majority in the Senate without appeal
ing '.o the Vice- President. Kentucky is
less certain, and it is unlikely that Secre
tary Carlisle or some other sound-money
Democrat will take the seat now held by
Senator Blackburn, but this would not
mean a gain for a protective tariff bill.
The existence of a safe antt - silver
majority in the Senate will probably com

next spring. Fouie pressure is likely to
be brought to bear upon the new adminis

'â â â  Everybody at I (he* headquarters of the
Republican s State Central Committee . is
happy. The cheerinz news came over the
wires last night that Tom Reed of Maine
is surely coming to California. ; - Since the
Maine election Maior Frank McLatighlin
and M. R. Higgins ; have : been exchanging
messages over tbe wire almost daily with
the man from Maine. They were deter
mined to bring Mr. Reed here, and hence
allowed no obstacles or objections: to dull
their purpose. Finally Mr. Reed man
aged to cancel some engagements in Kan
sas, and arranged fto come directly ftom
St. Louis to Loo Angeles. "^^iiSjj;.^

The arrival of tbe Maine statesman in

great event for Southern California. Dis
tinguished Republican leaders will go out
over the desert to , greet him , and escort
him to the City of the Angels. :â {â 'â '.-.' 'â â '-, \ f
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
The event in Los Angeles, as great as it
may be, will be but an incident compared
with the transcendent demonstration that
awaits the man in San Francisco. It is
needless to say that Reed's journey from
the Tehachapi range to the bay will be one
long ovation tendered by enthusiastic Re
publicans.
The Republican State Central Committee
will send out an able delegation to meet
the orator, but will hold in reserve until
Saturday, October 31, the main demonstra
tion in bis honor. That day will be tfaÂ«
uindup of the great campaign. So many
merchants, manufacturers and others
have petitioned for a day parade, prom'.s
--i ing all attaches a holiday on full pay, that
the committee has resolved to make a day
for people to see Keed and a r.igut for as
many to hear him as can find space
enough to stand in the Mechanics' Pa
vilion.
Two hondred thousand spectators will
doubtless throng the main thoroughfares
of this City to view the daylight industrial
parade. Not less interesting as an object
lesson in patriotism will be the demon
stration on the evening when the uni
formed clubs and the marching organiza
tions of the Republican party will escort
the popular speaker to the Pavilion.
The outcome of the negotiations be
tween Mr. Reed and the Republican State
Central Committee is that he shall speak
five times in California. It is settled that
he is to speak once in San Francisco,
once in Oakland and once in Los Angeles.
Two more appointments remain to be
made. It is possible that the committee
may be able to gel one more speech, mak
ing six in all. Should this arrangement
be effected the extra speecu may be given
in San Francisco.
No changes are likely to be made which
will disturb the plans for Saturday, Octo
ber 31. That is to be Tom Reed's day in
California. The industrial features of the
great procession on that occasion w ; ll be
worth a journey of many miles to view.
The elaborate decorations, the display of
Haps and patriotic emblems generally
should make San Francisco a queen of
beauty.
It has been remarked by observant spec
tators that San Francisco by virtue of her
bold eminences and graceful undulations
can dress with enchanting effect and
present a figure to excite the admiration
of spectators. The illumination at night
should be vast and beautiful.
While nothing will be left undone at
Republican State headquarters to pro
mote the general headway of the cam
paign throughout the State, special rare
and attention will be given to the work of
the wind-up. Ficuratively speaking, tha
campaign will close in a blaze of glory.
Tom Reed in this campaign is a free
lance. He is not speaking under the di
rect auspices of the Republican National
Committee. His appointments are not
made by that body, and he is therefore
free to select his own time and place for
public speaking. For California and Cali
fornians he entertains a high regard. Once
he was a schoolteacher in California
and it is assumed that he taught to the
satisfaction of the trustees. The last time
he visited this State ex-Governor Low, 8.
G. Hilborn and others of the Maine So
ciety gave him a dinner in San Francisco.
On that occasion political topics were
carefully avoided. Mr. Reed spoke of
Maine and the influence of Maine men
in the development of the country. He
will leave St. Louis to-morrow for^Los An
geles. On the trip his daughter, I^ittie,
will accompany him.
It was not generally known that Reed
had definitely decided to accept the in
vitation of the Republican State Central
Committee and visit California, and the
parade committee had been delaying ar
rangements for the street demonstration
until definite information was at hand.
Now that the coming of Reed is a fact, it
will arrange for the parade on the after
noon of October 31.
The procession in the afternoon will be
composed of all the clubs in the City, and
in the evening the flambeau and torch,
clubs will assemble and continue the car
nival of welcome, it being the intention
of the committee to make the demonstra
tion the most gorgeous of the campaign.
The parade committee has been impa
tiently waiting for ne,ws regarding Mr.
Reed's intended visit, and now that he
has accepted they intend to go to work
with a will and tender him a reception
the equal of which was ndver known in
the political history of the State.2

The Guardian of the Public Treasury
Obj cts to Debasement of Na
tional Mcney.
COVINGTON, Ky., Oct. 22.â John G.
Carlisle, Secretary of the Treasury, spoke
this evening at Odd Feliows' Hall in the
interest of sound-money Democracy. The
hall is not a large one, but had it been ten
times as lar^e it would not have held those
who came to hear t.ie Secretary.
Rumors had been circulated that -an
attempt would be made to break up the
meeting. There nas a disorderly element
present in the rear of the hail, who hissed
loudly as Carlisle appeared on the stage.
The majority of the audience, however,
was in sympathy with the speaker, and
drowned the hisses in vociferous cheering.
The disturbers compelled the Secretary to
Btop several times during the -early part
of his speech, but were finally quieted by
.Mayor Rhinock, and with the exception
of a few yells for Bryan no further trouble
occurred.
A counter demonstration was held by
the silverites iv the street in front of the
building, but it no way interfered with
the meeting inside the hall.
During tho interruption in the earlier
part of the meeting the secretary re
quested those who did not care to hear
him speak to leave the hall.
Mr. Carlisle spoke as follows:
I have come here to speak in behalf of Dem
ocratic candidates pledged to the principles
oi a Democratic platform, and my purpose is
to discuss some of the pending political ques
tions from a purely Democratic standpoint.
We are not Republicans or Populists, or fu-
Bionists; we are simply plain, ola-fashioned
Democrats without any modern adulterations
in our doctrines, or any Populistic or com
munist appendages to our organization.
He referred to the fact that here in this
county, when less than 20 years old, he
had begun his career as a public speaker
by opposing the doctrines of the "Know
Nothing party" and since that time he
challenged his critics to show that he had
ever uttered an undemocratic sentiment
or cast an undemocratic vote. Then he
proceeded to analyze what the principles
of Democracy were â meaning American
Democracy, not "that wiid, turbulent and
destructive form of Democracy which has
been imported from abroad and which is
bo nearly allied to anarchy that it is pi
most imposs b!e to distinguish one from
â-.c other." Of the candidates of the Na
tional Democracy he said:
John M. Palmer and Simon Bolivar Bnckner
are not strangers to the American people;
they were not discovered yesterday by the be
wildered delegates to a political convention,
and they will not be forgotten when the sound
and fury of this remarkable campaign have
Bubsidcd. They are soldiers arid statesmen,
riDe with the experience derived from long
public service at the critical periods in our
history, and they stand conspicuously in this
contest for law and order, for the inviolability
of contracts, for the independence and man
hood oi Hil classes of our people, for just and
<^qual taxation for public purposes only, for a
sound and stable currency, and for tne
maintenance of the National authority and
National honor under all circumstances.
In regard to the question of the regu
larity oi their nomination he said:
Let us inquire for a moment how far mere
considerations of regularity are influencing the
actions of our critics in this campaign. The
nominations made at Chicago have been par
tially repudiated by the very men who made
them in a majority of the States. The Na
tional and State committees appointed to
carry on ihe campaign and piedges to the sup
port of both the nominees of the Chicago con
vention â to the support of one just as much
as the supDort of the otherâ have in twenty
six or twenty-seven States deliberately en
tered into airangements and combinations
to deprive one of the nominees of
a large number of electoral votes and
give them to another candidate not
nominates by that convention, nor by any
other convention even pretending to be Demo
cratic, and yet these gentlemen have the
assuran- c to culi us bolters, and the Presiden
tial candidate hlDiselt", who has countenanced
and encouraged ihe sacrifice of nis associate
ou the ticket, whose nomination wan a regular
us his own, tells us that we "cannot get back
into the Democratic party unless we come in
sackcloth and ashes." Gentlemen, we are not
out oi the Democratic party, and do not in
tend to go out or be put out.
Then he discussed what past Democratic
platforms had been on the financial ques
tion, contrasting them with the Chicago
declaration in favor of the free coinage of
silver at ltj to L He continued :
Notwithstanding all that has been said or
may be Hereafter said to the contrary, we have
now a distinct mouetary system of our own,
freely adopted by our own legislation, with
out dictation from or consultation with, any
other nation in the world, and we have the
right and power to Change it or abolish it al
together whenever we choose. The question
Is not whether the United States alone has
the power to adopt free coinage and silver
monometallism, but whether, in view of our
own democratic conditions and interests and
of our ext.-nsive commercial relations with
other civilized nations of the world, it would
De a good policy and good faith to make sucn
a radical change in our currency ana such a
wholesale repudiation of our obligations. Ii is
not a question of power, it is not a question of
National independence, but it is a question of
National prosperity and National honor.
Secretary Carlisle proceeded to discuss
at length the effects of free silver coinage.
Its advocates advanced three distinct and
wholly inconsistent propositions. Their
first proposition, he said, is that free coin
age at the ratio of 16 to 1 will give the
people cheap money, that it will reduce
the value of the dollar about one-half, so
that it will require about twice as many
dollars to procure a given quantity of
coramoditif sas are required now. This is
the high price argument and is addressed
to the farmors and so-called debtor class.
Their second proposition is that free coin
age will no^ make cheap or depreciated
morfey, but will raise the value of the
, silver dolJar to an equality with the pres
ent value of the gold dollar, and, of course,
it requires no arcument to convince an
intelligent audience that, if this is true,
prices will bo no higher tiian they are
now, and producers and deb; ors will get
no more dollars than they get now.
Tbi3 is the argument addressed to the
more conservative classes who do not be
lieve in a depreciated currency, but who
have been persuaied that there is not a
sufficient amount of money in the coun
try. Their third proposition, whicn ap
pears to be a compromise between the
other two, is that free coinage will not in
crease the value of the silver dollar to an
equality with the present value of the
pold dollar, but that it will raise the value
of silver up and bring the value of gold
down so that the two metals will meet at
some intermediate point and consequent
ly establish parity at the ratio of 16 to 1
This argument is addressed to those who
are supposed to be in favor of a depreciated
currency, but are not yet quite ready to
accept a dollar worth only 50 cents.
Driven away from the advocacy of the
first proposition in many parts of the
country by reason of its manifest and
gross injustice to the laboring man, to de
positors in savings banks and other insti
tutions, and creditors generally, and
forced by the unanswerable arguments of
their opponents in other parts of the
country to abandon the second one on ac
count of its demonstrated absurdity they
have to resort to the third as a compro
mise between the advocates of absolute
fiatism and the advocates of partial or
modified fiatism, but, the contention that
the United States alone can, by the free
coinage of silver, increase the value of that
metal and also reduce the value of gold
simply doubles the difficulties which our
opponents nave encountered in this dis
cussion.
To believe that free coinage by the
United States alone would accomplish
either of these results requires a faith in
fiatism which would remove mountains,
but to believe that it would accomplish
both exhibits a degree of credulity un
paralleled in the annals of human affairs.
Taking up in detail each of these three
propositions Mr. Carlisle went on to show
how the Jaw of supply and demand and
tho recorded experience of the world for
at least six centuries refuted each of them.
The natural law on the subject, whicn we
could neither repeal nor alter, seemed to
be that when the production and coinage
of either gold or silver into legal-tender
money were increased in proportion to
the production and coinage of the other
metal, the relative value of the coins thus
disproportionately added to the circula
tion decreases, and the rule was the same
when the increase consisted of gold coins
or silver coins.
To protect themselves against the evil
effects of a threatened depreciation of
their money, and to enable them to main
tain tne parity of their silver and gold
coins already in use, Holland, France,
Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Greece and
Venezuela have all been compelled since
the year 1875 to suspend the coinage of
legal tender s*ilver. Spain was forced
also to stop the coinage in 1879, ex
cept on Government account, and
in 1893 the Government of British
India, a silver monometallic coun
try, after ah exhaustive examination of
the subject in all its asnects, suspended
the coinage on individual account for the
avowed purpose of preventing the further
iall of the silver rupee and establishing a
fixed par of exchange with London and
other financial centers in Europe. But
according to the free silver advocates the
statesmen and financiers of all these
countries moved in exactly the wrong
direction, and if they had wanted to main
tain parity or to establish parity, they
ought to have opened their mints to the
free coinage of all the silver in the world
instead of closing them.
The increased coinage of legal-tender
silver at a ratio which overvalued that
metal relatively to gold would not
diminish the demand for gold anywhere
or terminate the struggle for its posses
sion, but would greatly' increase the de
mand and intensify the struggle, because,
if two kinds of money of the same denomi
nation but of unequal value were in ex
istence, everybody would strive to get the
most valuable, and as the number of silver
dollars increased their value relatively to
gold would decrease.
In opposition to any such policy as tbat
proposed by the Chicago and Populist
conventions he urged that by holding
last to the best money the people would
always have the best things that money
could buy. Turning to other parts of the
platform Mr. Carlisle said if the free and
unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of
16 to 1 were the only issue presented every
old-line Democrat in the country wouia be
fully justified in refusing to support the
nominee of the Chicago and St. Louis Pop
ulist conventions, but it is not the only
issue, and it might in the end prove to be
not even the most important one. When
was it ever before declared by any conven
tion ever pretending to be Democratic
that the Federal GoTernment had the con
stitutional authority to interfere with pri
vate contracts between individual citizens
of the same State ?
In view of the iacts that it was also pro
posed to have the Government purchase
and operate all the railroad and telegraph
lines, and isdue paper to pay for them,
that it was to coin at the public expense
all the silver in the world, if the owners
of the bullion saw proper to present it at
our mints, that it was to inaugurate and
maintain a system of public works,
whether needed or not, sufficient to give
constant employment to laborer?, who
were not otherwise occupied, and that
it was to establish postal savings banks
in every part of the country to
receive idle money on deposit and pay in
terest on it, whether it could use the
money or not, he thought it not extrava
gant to say that the people were threat
ened with a social and political revolution
of the gravest character â a revolution
which, if successful, would subvert the
fundamental principles upon which the
Government is founded, tax the private
industries of the people out of existence
and convert our system into a socialistic
despotism. When to this extravagance
and demoralizing demand was added that
other revolutionary feature of ti;e Chicago
platform, a substantial avowal of a pur
pose to make the judiciary part of the
political machine by reconstructing the
bupreme Court in order to dictate its
judgments upon questions of constitu
tional law, a plan of operations was pro
posed more dangerous to our institutions
ihan was ever suggested by any party in
the past.
TWO KILLED AND FOUR WOUNDED.
Bloody Battle in Florida That May Lead
Up to a Serious War of Whites
Against Negroes.
CHIPLEY, Fla., Oct. 22.â A bloody
battle took place here last night ir which
two men were killed and four others seri
ously wounded.
The trouble arose over wages. The man
who did the killing was J. M. Criglar,
manager of Hagerman's lumber-mills,
while the others were laborers.
The mills usually empioy a great many
men and recently there has been consid
erable discontent over the wages paid.
Last night the trouble culminated. The
men made a threatening demonstration
about the mills. Criglar tired into the
crowd, killing two negro assailants and
seriously wounding four others.
The negroes are very much excited over
the affair and trouble Ss feared. The white
people are prepared to defend themselves
and a race war is imminent. The popula
tion of the place is only 354 and is about
evenly divided in color. The town is on
the Louisville and Nashville Railroad,
118 miles east of Pensacola.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1869.
BRYAN RESORTS -
TO WILD THREATS
Enraged by the Noticeable
Defection From Silver
Ranks.
Declares That Democrats Who
Desert Him May Be Left
in the Cold.
CANNOT RETURN TO THE PARTY
Cfiss-Cross Route of the Boy Orator
of the Platte in the Hoosier
State.
TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Oct. 22.â Clear,
cool autumn weather, with just enough
warmth from the sun to make an overcoat
unnecessary, favored William J. Bryan in
his criss-cross route through the land of
the Hoosier to-day. Eyery town along the
line* of his progress to Terre Haute, where
bis campaign in this State eiidcd to-night,
made a holiday of his coming. Free silver
barbecues were held at two of the place 3
visited and scores of sheep, oxen and pigs
were offered as sacrifices to the exponent
of 16 to 1. From Decatur early in the
morning until Terre Haute to-night Mr.
Bryan was the recipient of a continuous
ovation, free from any attempts to offset
its significance such as were made during
his journey through Ohio ana his first
day of Indiana campaigning.
The Indiana State Committee had ar
ranged the itinerary well. Big towns
followed in close succession all along the
way. Brazil, distinctly a mining com
munity, and Crawfordsville, the home of'
General Lew Wallace, although smaller
than many of the places visited, were not
exceeded in wildly demonstrative appre
ciation of the Candidate by any of the
more populous cities. It was at Craw
fordsville that Mr. Bryan replied to the
charge made by General Wallace that he
was an anarchist. At Peru, where a great
political barbecue was held, with Senator
Teller, ex-Congressman Lafe Pence of
Colorado, Senator Turpie of Indiana and
others as attractions, he addressed him
self to the local defection in the Demo
cratic ranks, and warned those of promi
nence who had left the party that they
might not be taken back again. Twice
during the day he made reply to speeches
delivered by ex-President Harrison on his
present tour through this State. Three
addresses from one stand were delivered
by Mr. Bryan to big audiences at Lafayette,
and at Terre Haute ho made two before
very large assemblages. Altogether he
spoke seventeen times, at Decatur, Hun
tineton, Rochester, Delphi, Frankfort,
Linden, Ladoga, Rochedaie, Greencastle
and the other p. aces mentioned.
The Bryan day demonstration here con
cluded to-night with two speeches by the
silver champion. Silver clubs and" war
veterans escorted him from the railroad
depot, where he arrived at 8:45, more than
two hours late, to the courthouse. The
streets were crof'ded with people all
along the route. At the courthouse Mr.
Bryan addressed 20,000 people and then
proceeded to the Terre Haute House,
where he spoke to 8000 more people. At
the courthouse, after discussing the money
question and using familiar arguments in
favor of the free coinage of silver, Mr.
Bryan said:
I believe it is claimed by the Republicans
that their candidate is the advance agent of
prosperity. I think they have the wrong
man; I think they were speaking of ihe ehaiÂ»
man of the National Committee, not of the
candidate, and that the Republican commit
teemanâthe chairman of the committeeâ ls
the advance astent of that peculiar prosperity
that comes jnst before the election to those
who expect to make enough money in the
campaign to run them until the next cam
pÃisn come. [Cheers.]
If you want to know who is to be prosperous
under the Republican administration, if the
Republicans win, I beg you to go and find out
â who is contributing money to secure the elec
tion. It you can find "where the money
comes from then you will know that the peo
ple who contribute the money expect to be
prosperous for four years more, nnd will get
back more out of the people than they spent to
corrupt the people. [Great cheering.]
In charge of Parks Martin, chairman of
the Indiana Democratic State Committee,
the Bryan special train left Fort Wayne
at 7:30 o'clock this morning for the second
and last day's run through Hoosierlanrf.
The first ston was at Decatur at 8:05,
where Mr. Bryan spoke fiteen minutes!
At Marke! a small number heard him, and
at Huntincton he addressed a gathering
of 2000 for ten minutes. The 1000 people
at Laiceton were mostly farmers.
A political barbecue was in progress at
Rochester when Mr. Bryan reached that
place. People had flocked in by the hun
dreds from the neighborhood round
about and the Democratic candidate
had- an audience of between 8000
and 10 000. Hon. Ben F. Sliiveley,
Democratic candidate for Governor, had
jii3t concluded a speech as Mr. Bryan ap
peared. The latter in the course of his re
marks read from thÂ« platform adopted by
the Indiana Republican Convention in
1890. Concerning it he said :
The Republican platform which I have read
in your hearing commended that silver bill as
a long yet prudent step toward free coinage,
and yet when we tell you that free coinage is
Â« good thine our opponents tell vi we are
lunatics and cranks and idiots. [Laughter.]
If yon would six years ago brag about a long
step toward free coinage, why don't you brag
when we want to go the whole distance all ai
once? [Great cheering.]
"The only barbecue town on earth"
was the principal inscription on the post
ers announcing the Bryan meeting at
Peru, and a political barbecue was in prog
ress when the Democratic candidate, es
corted by a long procession, reached the
grounds. A formidable list of free-silver
orators had been engaged for the occa
sion, including Senator Teller. Senator
David Turpie and ex-Congressman Lafe
Pence of Colorado, and ibese made ad
dresses after Mr. Bryan had spoken and
continued his jonrnev toward Terra
Haute. B. F. Shiveley, Democratic candi
date for Governor, was nlso present.
Between 8000 and 10,00'j people were in
attendance, and ereat cheering began as
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan appeared on tue
platform. A noticeable feature of the
occasion was the absence of Ihe yellow
badges that had been displayed so promi
nently through Ohio and other parts of
Indiana where the Nebraska man spoke.
There had been a defection in the Demo
cratic ranks at Peru, and Mr. Bryan's
remarks were directed mainly to those
who had decided to leave the party. To
them he said in part:
When you leave the Democratic party in this
campaign I want you to leave knowing what
it means. Do not think that you can leave us
this year in the greatest fight that Democracy
has had for half a centuryâ do not think that
in the presence of the most dangerous enemy
you can desert and then come back next year
and take a position of command. You cannot
do it, my friends. [Cheers.] The mau who
leaves the Democratic party in its great fight
this year to restore tue Government to those
old foundations laid by Jefferson and Jackson
need not expect to come back until he has
fully atoned for the sin he commits this year.
[Cheers.] The Bible tells us that when the
prodigal son got tired feeding the hogs and
came home the father met him with open arms
and killed the fatted caU for him. well, my
friends, I want you to understand that tho
prodigal son who leaves the Democratic house
hold this year and goes off to feed the bogs
[laughter], when he comes back he lias got to
come with the understanding that he must
saw wood a long while before he ce ts to the
table. [Laughter.] As ono of the speakers in
Michigan said, when he corner back we will
say, "Kill the prodigal; the call has come
home."
The gold badges were likewise few at
Delphi, where Mr. Bryan spoke briefly to
between 5000 and 6000 people. He told
them to vote for ex-Representative Chea
dle for Congress, and said it was better to
support by the ballot a silver Republican
than one who had formerly been a Dem
ocrat, but was now running on a gold
ticket.
A crowd of about 10,000 was addressed
briefly by Mr. Bryan at Frankfort, but ft
was not to be considered in point of size
beside the tremendous audience that had
gathered at Lafayette. It was, iv fact,
three separate gatherings all in the court
house square, and Mr. Bryan made three
speeches from the same platform, one
from each side. There were at least 25,000
in the assemblage. Mr. Bryan in
his speech had something to say about
the position of General Harrison in this
campaign. He said:
I want to ask you to consider for a moment
the position taken by the leading advocate of
the other side, ex-President Harrison. I think I
am justified in saying that of all the supporters
of Mr. McKinley's ejection Mr. Harrison is the
ablest and most distinguished. He made a
speech yesterday in which he tried to show
the Impossibility of there being a double
standard, and yet Mr. Harrison was elected
President on a platform which denounced
Grover Cleveland for trying to demonetize sil
ver. [Cheers.] He tried to show that it was
impossible to have two yardsticks and yet
he ran four years ago on a platform that
declared that the American people from tra
dation and interest fnvorea bimetallism, which
means a double standard. [Cheers.] But
worse tnan that, while he opposed
the double standard, he is trying to run
on two platforms this year. He said in
his speech yesterday, "The present condi
tions are that we are a bimetallic country,"
and yet the Republican platform of this year
says that we must maintain the present gold
standard. [Cheers.] If we are a bimetallic
country why did not the platform say mat we
must maintain the presen.t bimetallic stand
ard? And yet, while the Republican platform
declares tnat we are at present under a single
gold standard, Mr. Harrison states that we
ftre under a bimetallic standard. [Cheers.]
What does it taean, my friends? It means
that, having been defeated in this campaign
on the gold standard, now, as the election ap
proaches, they are trying to get under cover ol
bimetallism and claim that their platform is
false. [Cheers.]
At Linden Mr. Bryan spoke to a small
gathering. Crawfordsville came next and
he:e the nominee encountered one of the
most wildly enthusiastic audiences of the
day, although it numbered about 5000
only. The 'speech of Mr. Bryan there was
devoted in part to answering the charge
made by General Lew Wallace, a resident
of the town, that he was an anarchist. He
defended the Chicago platform from the
charge that it was anarchistic.
Rockdale turned out a small crowd.
The assemblage at Greencastle stretched
away off into the darkness and could not
be estimated for that reason. It
was reserved for Brazil, the well
known mining center, to exceed in
demonstrative appreciation of the
Democratic candidate any small city at
wnich he spoke during the day. It was
7:30 when Mr. Bryan's train reachea that
place. All along the streets to the park
where the speaking occurred he was
wildly cheered. A thousand miners were
in the escort procession. The nearby
neighborhood had contributed to the im
mense throng that gathered to hear him,
and it is estimated that nearly, if not
quite, 25,000 people composed the con
courde. Mr. Bryan brought out no new.
points in his speech, but everything he
said was vigorously applauded. At 8:15
the Bryan special pulled out Jor Terre
Haute, where it arrived thirty minutes
late.
Citirfn Mlveritea Beaten.
BUTTE, Mont., Oct. 22.â The Supreme
Court to-day decided against the so-called
Citizens' Silver party and its electoral
ticket will not appear on the official ballot.
The electors were the same as the Demo
cratic-Populistic and were put up by the
A. P. A. Republicans so that their county
tickets might f appear both under the Mc-
Kinley andF liryart'* electors. In retali
ation the A. P. A. attacked the ticket of
the Silver Republicans, including the can
didacy of Congressman Hartman, but the
Supreme Court refused to interfere with
that party on the ground that the nomi
nations were made in convention while
the Citizens' Silver party were not.
HELD IN AN EMBASSY,
Chinese Officiate in London
Kidnap and Detain a
Refugee.
Sun Vat Sen Will Be Shipped Back
to China for Plotting to Over.
throw the Dynasty.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 22.â A great sen
sation was created this afternoon by the
publication in the Globe of a story that
detectives, at the instance of the Foreign
Office, have been watching the Chinese
embassy here for some days past in con
sequence of two Chinese officials having
seized and kidnaped a Chinese physician
named Sun Vat Sen, belonging in Hong
kong, as he was passing the Chinese em
bassy on October 17, the kidnaped man
having been detained in ihe embassy ever
since.
In explanation of this act, the Globe
says that in November, 1895. a conspiracy
was formed to depose the Tartar dynasty
in China, beginning with the seizing of
the Viceroy at Canton. For this purpose
400 coolies were imported into Canton
from Hongkong. The existence of the
conspiracy leaked out, and the authorities
seized and beheaded fifteen of the leaders,
but the others managed to make their
escape, among them Sun Vat Sfcn, who
went to America, passed through that
country and finally came to England, and
has since been in London.
According to the Globe, friends of the
kidnaped man say that a ship has already
been chartered by the Chinese embassy to
take him back to China. The British
autnorities are powerless to relieve the
man from the embassy; as the law does
not permit the embassy or legation of a
foreign country to be invaded.
CHANGES IN COSTUMS BATES.
Li Hung Chang Jitmirf* That China Be
raid in Gold.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 22.-Li
riung Chang, when he visited Washing
ton, conferred with Secretary Carlisle as
to certain changes contemplated in the
Chineee customs rates. As Secretary
Olriey was not in the city at the time the
Chinese Embassador left with the Chi
nese legation here a memorandum ,
printed in English, in which the changes
are set forth.
The changes make the duties payable in
gold or its equivalent instead of silver
taels. Li Hung Chang stated that Bilver
taeh were authorized to be used In Tao
Kwang's time and continued without
change until the dynasty of Hien Fung.
Since then the value of silver has declined,
he says, and in justice to China, which
has now established international rela
tions, "both the necessities of the day and
consideration of what is fair and right de
mand that the original value of the cus
toms tael be re-enumerated and that thÂ«
value of silver at which China consented
to collect duties, viz.: three taela to tne
ponnd, be observed and adhered to."

DECEMBER WHEAT
TAKES A TUMBLE
Collapse in Prices Almost
Causes a Panic in
the Pit.
Scenes of Great Excitement on
'Change in Chicage Are
Witnessed.
LABGE QUANTITIES UNLOADED.
Thousands of Bushels Dumped on the
Market, but All the Offerings
Are Not Bought.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 22.â December
wheat took another big tumble on the-
Board of Trade to-day and the wild excite
ment on 'Change which accompanied the
collapse bordered on a panic. There was
a fall of 4%c from yesterday's close, ex
ceeding the advance for any day since the
sensational upward movement began in
this country and abroad. The closing
price to-day was 70% c. Late in the day
there was a recovery and the highest point
during the morning session was 74' jC.
Toward the closing hour the slump was
so rapid that drops of 1 cent and more
found no bidders. The price went from 73
to 71 \-i in five minutes. The scenes in the
pit were such as Board of Trade history is
made of. There was a frantic rush of sell
ers on the strength of a rumor that Cudahy
had joined Armour in unloading his hold
ings. Thousands of bushels were dumped
on the market, but there were no buyers
who could keep pace with the quantity
offered. There were some heavy losses,
and general fear i 3 expressed for to-mor
row. The main cause of the decline was
said to be failure to secure advances from
the banks for buying cash wheat.
Within half an hour after the opening
the price of December went down 2% cents
and the inexorable banker was blamed for
refusing to lend money on any terms. The
demand for money overshadowed all talk
of foreign shortage, of shipments to India
or news from Australia or Russia. Cash
wheat sold below futures and the price of
the former declined from 6 to 7 cents be
fore traders were allowed a breathing
spell.
Armour said that the key to the situa
tion was the scarcity of money and that
the price of cash wheat was pulling future
wheat down. The curb last night pre
pared thÂ« way for the slaughtering of the
market price to-day. Wheat sold at 74
cents in the street, and this, added to the
cry of distressfrom the cash market, thiew
the pit into hysterics at the opening.
Houses were swamped with country orders
to sell at a certain price if the decline con
tinued. Most of them wanted the deal
stopped at 74 to 74% cents, but belore they
could as much as snout "sold" the expert
in the box had marked the price down
from 75J4 to 72% cents.
Then pandemonium broke loose in all
its fury, and the bravest speculator was
filled witn a dread of what might come
next. The bulls with big fines of Decem
ber wheat, who have been busy unloading
during the last few days, surrendered
some more to the tottering market. They
sold at prices which brought them fort
unes and took their chances of buying
back again at a lower price. The bulls
who have been crying "dollar wheat,"
however, have not been silenced by the
tumble of the last two days. The bankers
said that the election uncertainty made it
imperative for conservative banks to de
cline loans for speculation in large suma.
Armour's grain department stated the
money market was becoming more closely
allied to the wheat market, and that the
election was the only relief in sight.
ST. LOUIS, Mo!, Oct 22.âNotwith
standing the effort of the bulls to main
tain prices and even advance the mar
ket, the speculative character of the ad
vance in wheat was demonstrated to-day
when the bears almost without effort low
ered the December option from 76% to 73%
cents. Liquidation by the trailers wiio
wanted to eet out on a raise aided the
bears. The first and most powerful factor
was the fact that European markets re
sponded so quickly and largely to yester
day's break on this side. A decrease in
receipts did not materially check the gen
eral downward tendency. A report that
605,000 bushels had been worked at Duluth
{or shipment yesterday and that the total
engagements for export at New York
were seventy-five loadf, witn heavy clear
ances, caused a sudden stiffness in the
market, but it soon died out again and
another decline set in. This started some
liquidation and there was a panic, traders
climbed over each.other in their desire to
sell. The pit was wild for a time, but just
before the close there was a slight re
action. The selling was not heavy, as
no one was anxious to buy, there having
been a decline of 8 cents with hardly a
rally.
After a moment's rest there was an
other break and December dropped to 73
cents, but rallied slightly at the close,
closing one-eighth of a cent better than
that asked, but at a net loss for the day of
3% cents and 9 cents down from the top.
May showed a net loss of 5% cents for the
day and was weak at that. On the curb
the balance ol prediction was on the side
of the. maintenance of prices, and the ar
gument of short crops abroad, depleted
stock?, etc., was made to support the con
tention.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Oct. 22.â For the first
time in years the elevator companies
have found it impossible to conduct busi
ness on a natural basis. Because of their
inability to eet money for wheat storage
operations they are compelled to sell the
wheat bought in the country in order to
realize money with which to make further
purchases.
The demand for cash wheat is thus cut
in two by the fact that terminal compa
nies nnd it difficult to pro vid a themselves
with necessary money, so that millers
come in as practically the only support of
the cash marKet and their wants are not
sufficient to take all the wheat offered.
The result is the cash price has fallen
heavily within a week and elevator com
panies have widened their purchase charge
from 3 cents to 4 and 5 cents. They can
not pay more because they cannot sell the
wheat'except at a wide difference. The
millers have not money to put in wheat
except as the offer is "sufficiently low to
warrant the payment of a high interest
rate when they are fortunate enough to
find one who is willing to let money on
the best security on the money market.
Up to within a few days there has been
a fair supply of money moving wheat.
The elevator companies have, however,
been obliged to ship wheat to some extent
to provide funds, but they have not cut
the price to the farmers on that account.
Developments within a week have made it
imperative to do so, because Irom a pre
mium over December wheat the price of
cash wheat has fallen to 4 and 5 cents un
der December price.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 22.â The
Secretary of Agriculture to-day gave ex
pression to the following regarding the
recent rise in wheat:
"The rise of wheat in Chicago and New
York markets during the last sixty days
is about 20 cents a bushel. This on a crop
of 450,000,000 busheis makes $90,000,000.
And at least 200,000,000 busheis of this
wheat are now owned by and in the hands
of American farmers. Thus in less than
sixty days wheat has made for its pro
ducers about $40,000,000.
"During the same period silver has de
clined 2 cents an ounce, from 63 to 66
cents. The alleged kinship of prices for
wheat and silver is disproved. Wheat is
divorced from silver on the lawful ground
that the relation of sASpIy to demand ia
the sole regulator of values, and Bryan
and Watson and Sewall are made co-re
spondents because of their scandalous as
sertions. If it be dishonestiu a dollar to
rise in its power to purchase wheat, is it
not equally dishonest for wheat to rise in
its power to purchase dollars?"
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 22.â Tho Daily
News in its market review to-morrow
will say that the exaggerated views regard
ing wheat, which prevailed Monday, are
giving place to more reasonable ideas.
The position is serious, but not hopeless.
The sellers of Russian wheat still show a
great reserve, but there is a question
whether the Black Sea shippers are not
playing into the hands of the Americans
by 'holding their stocks. The Russian
crop is certainly smaller than tbat of 1895,
but there has not failed to be a material
surplus for exportation. The chief diffi
culty is a scarcity of tonnage, which^in
less than three months has trebled freights
from the Black Sea. The weakest point
in Great Britain is the lowness of stocks.
LIVERPOOL. Exg., Oct. 22. -The wheat
market here to-day weakened under the
influence of tho big decline in the United
States. Only a small business was done.
California options closed from yA to \]4<l
r>er cental lower. American red winter,
futures, closed from 3d to 3J^d lower.
WEYLER'S LATEST DECREE
Inhabitants Outside Fortified
Towns Must Concentrate
Quickly.
Transportation of Goois by Land and
Sea Is Also S.rictly Pro
hibited.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 22.âCaptain-Gen
era^ Weyler has issued a decree ordering
the inhabitants of the country outside the
fortifications of towns in tne province of
Pinar del Rio to concentrate within the
limits of the fortifications within eight
days. Transportation of goods to or from
the country towns by land and sea with
out permission is prohibited.
At the expiration of the eight day 3 all
persons found outside the limits will be
considered rebels and tried as such.
According to an official report the Piz
zaro regiment, under Colonel Flores, sur
prised the re*bel band under Acosta and
Delgado at Cocosolo, near Bejucal, prov
ince of Havana. The cavalrymen made a
furious attack upon the insurgents, who
were disconcerted by its suddenness and
fled in disorder. Nineteen dead rebels
were found upon the field, including the
leader Acosta. The Spaniards had three
men wounded.
On the 17th inst. Alfredo Laborde and
Orna Melton of the schooner Competitor
were taken to the cuarto de Banderas in
Fort Cabanas and their depositions taken
before the Judge Instructor, who informed
them that they were to be tried for piracy
and rebellion by a court-martial. They
had leceived no previous notification, and
were given no opportunity to communi
cate with Consul-General Lee. The in
dictments and method of procedure was
identical vith that of the former trial.
Laborde and Melton entered a protest
against the proceedings. It is believed
tbat General Lee had no notification of
the trial, and it is entirely illegal.
It is not known whether Leavitt and
Barnett will be tried at the same time or
not. On the 19ih Laborde, Melton and
Leavitt were again taken before the Judge
Instructor and again entered their protest,
claiming their right to communicate with
General Lee and that a trial held in the
Cabanas would be illegal for the reason
that no representative of the Consul could
be present, and also that a trial by court
martial was not in accordance with the
treaties existing between the United States
and Spain. No communication has been
received by the prisoners from Consul
Lee since the trial began. The merits of
their protests will be passed upon before
the real trial takes place. Two English
subjects, Gildea and Barnett, made depo
sitions, and also Dr. Eiias Bedia and
Teodero Maza?.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 22.â N0
official report has been received by Collec
tor of Customs C. R. Bisbee of the firing
on and capture of the alleged Cuban fili
bustering tugs Dauntless and R. L. Mabey,
off Jupiter Inlet yesterday by the United
States cruiser Raleigh. The revenue cutter
Boutwell left Jacksonville for the St.
Johns bar this morning to take charge of
the Dauntless and escort her to quaran
tine station at Fernandina, where she will
be fumigated and afterward brought to
this port and delivered to the United
States authorities. The tug R. L. Mabey,
which was also captured, did not reach
the bar last night, as she ia much slower
than the Raleigh and the Dauntless. The
Mabey arrired, however, eariy to-day in
charge of a prize crew from the Raleigh,
and will be brought to Jacksonville and
delivered to the United States authorities.
The cruiser Raleigh left for the south
this morning. It is said she is going to
Turtle Harbor to discover, if Dossible, the
island on which it is said ihe Cubans have
stored quantities of arms and ammuni
tion.
The firing on and seizure of the Daunt
less and Mabey has caused indignation
bere and is regarded as high-handed on
the part of Captain Miller of the Raleigh.
Neither the Dauntless nor the Mabey had
arms on board. The Dauntless had only
her regular crew and the Mabey had on
board a cargo of coal.
ALL WORKED IN HARMONY.
Mo Factions or Sectional Differences Be
fore the Board of Directors of the
Catholic University.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 22.-The
third and final session of the board of di
rectors of the Catholic University of
America this morning was very brief and
the only business transacted was that of
changing the annual meeting from
Wednesday after Easter,which practice has
been found generally inconvenient, to the
second Wednesday in October to coincide
with the annual meeting of Archbishops.
The board also issued the following state
ment before adjourning:
The board wishes it to be understood by the
public that there are absolutely no factions or
sectional differences among the members.
The election of candidates for rectorship was
practically unanimous. To speak of triumph oi
this or that party, of conservatism or liberalism,
nationalism or Americanism, is to misrepresent
the whole situation. All the members of the
board are equally American in spirit. They
have but one thought, and that is the welfare
oi the university and its steady progress to the
highest Catholic education.
After adjournment of the board of di
rectors the Archbishops held their annual
meeting. The. morning session was de
voted to administrative matters of no gen
eral interest. At the evening session
Father Stephan, who has charge of the
Indian schools, appeared before the Arch
bishops and gave a detailed s.atemen
the condition of those schools. After
some discussion the whole Indian-school
questfon was referred to a committee con
sisting of Cardinal Gibbons. Arcnbishops
Corrigan, Keane and Kyan. This com
mittee will meet at the residence of Cardi
nal Gibbons, in Baltimore, beginning us
session to-morrow. The parochial school
question did not come up in any form.

PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 22.â The sesqui
centennial anniversary of the granting of
the first charter of the College of New
Jersey was celsbrated this morning in
Alexander HalL This was anniversary
day proper in the celebration programme,
and many distinguished men who had ]
been unable to attend the other exercises j
for the sesqui-centennial were present to
day. Alexander Hall was crowded to its
utmost capacity by those eager to do hom
age to Princeton University in the hour
of her glory, and also to hear the address
of President Cleveland.
After the academic procession had filed
into the building prayer was offered by
the Rev. Dr. Theodore. Ouyler of Brook
lyn. Dr. Patton, in making the announce
ment of the university title, spoke of the
pleasure it gave the trustees that no change
in the charter of the college had been made
necessary in changing the corporate name.
He said:
"From this moment, what has hereto
fore been known as the college of New
Jersey will be known as 'Princeton Uni
versity.' "
After the cheers had subsided, he in
voked the blessing of God on the univer
sity and on the men in charge of its various \
departments. President Patton then
spoke of the success which had attended
the efforjs toward increasing the endow
ment of the university. Although the
complete list is not yet prepared, he an
nounced the founding of the McCormick
professorship and also the partial endow
ment of the McCosh chair of philosophy.
The gift of fo'oo,ooo for the library was
announced, but the name of the donor is
still withheld. Another gift of $250,000,
for a purpose not specified, was also ack
nowledged from an unknown source. The
total amount obtained up to the present
â was civen as $1,353,000.
Protessors Schields, Young, Slosn and
Murray then presented the names for the
doctor's degrees of men distinguished in
the department of philosophy, science,
education, history, political economy,
archeology, literature and art. Among
them were: Doctor of laws â Karl Brug
mann, University of Leipsic; Edward
Dowden, Trinity College, Dublin; Andrew
Seth, University of Edinburgh; Goldwin
Smith, Toronto; Joseph J. Tnompson,
University of Cambridge.
Among the Americans similarly honored
are: William Gardner Hale, University of
Chicago; William T. Harris, United Siates
Commissioner of Education; Joseph Le
Conte, University of California; Seth Low,
Columbia University, New York City.
The degree of doctor of divinity was
conferred among others upon: Rev. Mor
gan Di-t, New York; Bishop John F.
Hurst, Washington, D. C. ; Rev. S. J. Me-
Pherson, Chicago; Rev. S. .1. Niccolls, St.
Louis; Rev. Professor M. B. Riddle, Pitts
burg, Pa.
Upon the following, among others, the
degree of doctor of letters was conferred:
Richard Watson Gilder, Augustus St.
Gaudins, H. E. Schurder, Charles Dudley
Warner.
The honorary degree 'of doctor of laws
was also conferred in absentia upon Lord
Kelvin, the Scottish naturalist, and Otto
Struve, formerly director of the observa
tory at Pulkowa, Russia.
President Cleveland was then introduced
and took the platform amid a tumult of
cheers and enthusiasm. No more hearty
welcome could possibly have been ac
corded any one than was given to his Ex
cellency. His address was as follows:
Mr. President and Gentlemen: As those in
different occupations and with different train
ing each Fee most plainly in the same land
scape view those features which are the most
nearly related to their several habitual envi
ronments, so in our contemplation of an event
or an occasion each individual especially ob
serves aud appreciates in the light his mode of
thought supplies such of its features and inci
dents ns are most in harmony with bis mental
situation.
To-day, while all of us warmly share the
great enthusiasm and felicitation which per
vte'e this assemblage, I am sure its various
suggestions and meanings assume prominence
in our respective fields of mental vision, de
pendent upon their relation to our experience
and condition. Those charged with iho man
agement and direction of the educational ad
vantages of this noble institution most plainly
see, with well-earned satisfaction, proofs of its
growth and usefulness and its enhanced op
portunities for doing good.
The graduate of Princeton sees first the evi
dence of a greater glory and prestige that have
come to h:s aim* mater and the added honor
thence restrained upon himself. Avhiie those
still within her student halls see most promi
nently the promise of an increased dignity
which awaits their graduation from Princeton.
But there are others here, not of ihe family
of Princeton, who set the signs of her triumphs
on the fields of higher education and the part
she has- taken during her }ong and glorious
career in the elevation and betterment of a
great people. Among these I take an humble
place, and as I yield lo the influences of this
occasion I cannot resist the train of thought
which especially reminds me of the promise of
National safety and the guaranty oi Ihe pcr
menenre of cur lreÂ« institutions which may
and ought to radiate irom the universities and
colleges scattered throughout our land.
Obviously a government resting upon the
will and universal suffrage of the people hss
no anchorage except in the people's inteir.
geuce. While the advantages of a collegiate
education arc by no means necessary to good
citizenship, yet the college graduate, found
every* heft, cannot smother his opportunities
to teach his fellow rour, trymen and Influence
them lor good, nor hide his talents IB a nap
kin without recreancy to a trust. In a Nm
tion like ours a spirit of conservatism and tol
eration is essential. A coilcgiote training, tbe
principles unvexed by distracting nnd mit
k-ading influences and a correct apprehension
o: !hÂ«; Ihenrie* upon vhicii our Kepubiie is
established ought to constitute the college
traduau; a constant monitor, warning againsi
popular reotintss and <-x:ces<.
'li.c character of ot:r institutions and our
Nation,"., sell-interest require that a feeling of
sincere brotherhood ami a disposition to uniu
in mutual endeavor should pervade our peo
ple. Our scheme ol government in its begin
ning was based upon this sentiment, and r
interruption has ne.vor failed and can r:cvu
lriil to grievously menace our National healt i
Who can better' caution against passlnn a: \
bitterness than those who know by twDKiit
aaÂ«l study their baneful consequence^ laad
who are themselves within the nobie brother
hood of higaer education?
There are naiurai laws and economic truths
whicn command implicit obdience, nnd winch
should unalterably fix the bounds of whole
some popular discussion and the limits of to
liticaUtrifj. The knowledge gained In our uni
versities and colleges wou:d be sadly deficient
if its beneficiaries were unable U> recognize
and point out to tneir fel!cw-cinze:is these
truths and natural laws and to teach the mis
chievous futility of tneir no:i-ob=ervance or
attempted violation.
The activity of our people and their restless
desire 10 gather to themselves especial bene
fits and advautazes lead to the growth of an
unconfessed tendency t<> regard their Govern
ment as the giver of private gifts, and to look
upon the agencies lor its administration fas
the distributors of official places and prefer
ment. Those who in university or college
have had an opportunity to study the mis>ion
of our institutions, and who in the light of
history have reasoned the dangers to a people
oi their neglect of the patriotic care they owe
the NatioiiHl Hie entrusted to their keeping,
should be well fitted to constantly (icinoiiisli
tlieir fellow-citizens that the useiu'.ness and
beneficence of tneir p'.an of government can
only be preserved through their unselfish nnd
10-ing support, a: d ihe:r contented willing
ness to accept in full return the peace,-protec
tion and opportunity which it impartially be
â¢stows.
Not more surely do the rule* of boncsty nnd
good faith fix the standard of individual char
acter in a community than do these same
rules determine the character aud standing of
a nation in tue world of civilization. Neither
the glitter of its power nor the tinsel of its
commercial prosperity, nor the gaudy show of
its people's wealth can conceal the cankering
rust of national dishonesty and cover the
meanness of national bad faith. A constant
siream of thoughtful men should come from
our universities a:id colleges preaching na
tional honor and integrity and teaching that
a beliet in the necessity oi national obedience
to the laws of God is not born of superstition.
I do not forget the practical necessity of po
liticul parties, nor do I deny their desirability.
I recognize wholesome differences of opinion
touching legitimate governmental policies
and would by 110 menus control or limit tne
utmost freedom in their discussion. I have
only attempted to suggest the important
patriotic service which otir institutions of
hight- r education and theirgraduatesare fitted
' to render to our people in the enforcement of
j the immutable truths and fundamental prin
ciples which are related to our National con
dition, but should never be dragged into the
fields of political strife nor impressed into the
service of partisan contention. When the ex
citement ot party warfare prrsses dangerously
near our National safeguards, I would have
the intelligent conservatism of our universi
ties and colleges warn the contestants in im
pressive tones against the perils of a breach
impossible to repair.
When a popular discontent and passion are
stimulated by the arts of designing partisans
to a pitch perilously near to class hatred or
sectional anger, I would have our universities
and colleges sound the alarm in the name of
brotherhood and fraternal dependence.
When the attempt is made to delude the
people into the belief that their suffering*
can change the operation of natural laws, f
wouid have our universities and colleges pro
claim that those laws are inexorable and far
removed from political control.
When selfish interest seeks undue private
benefit through governmental aid and public
F laces are claimed as rewards of party service,
would have our universities and colleges
persuade the people to relinquish tha demand
for party spoils and exert them to a disinter
ested and patriotic love of their Government
for its own sake, and beciiuse in its true ad
j justraent and unperverted operation it se
cures to every citizen his just share of the
safety and prosperity itholas in store for all.
When a design is apparent to blind the peo
ple's eyes to the sad plight of National dis
honor and bad faith, I would have Princeton
University, panoplied In her patriotic tradi
tions aud glorious memories and joined by all
the other universities and colleges of our land,
cry out against the infliction of this treacner
ous and fatal wound.
I would have the influence of these Institu
tions on the side of religion and morality. 1
would have those they send out among the
! peop'.e ashamed to acknowledge God and to
proclaim his interposition in the affairs of
! men, enjoining such obedience to his laws as
\ makes manifest the path of National perpetu
ity and prosperity. I hasten to concede the
good already accomplished by our educated
men in puri:ying and steadying political sen
tiroent, but I nope I may be allowed to inti
mate my belief that their work m these direc
tions will be easier and more useful if it were
less spasmodic and occasional.
The disposition of our people is such that
while they may be inclined to distrust those
who only on a few occasions come among
them from an exclusiveness savoring of as
sumed superiority they readily listen to those
who exhibit a real fellowship and a irlendly
and habitual interest in all that concerns
the common welfare. Such a condition of in
timacy would, 1 believe, not only improve the
General political atmosphere, but would vastly
incrense the influence of our universities fend
colleges in their efforts to prevent popular de
lusions, or correct them before they reach an
scute or dangerous stage. lam certain, there
fore, that a more constant and active partici
pation in political affairs on the part of our
men of education would be of the greatest
possible value to the country.
It is exceedingly unfortunate that politics
should be regarded in Â«ny quarter ac an tin
clean thing, to be avoided by these claiming
to be educated or respectable. It would be
strange, indeed, if anything related to the
administration of our Government or the wel
fare ot our Nation should be essentially de
grading. I believe it is not a superstitious
sentiment that leads to the conviction that
God has watched over our National life lrom
its beginning. Who will say that the things
worthy of God's regard and tosteriug care are
unworthy of the touch of the Visest and best
of men ?
I would have those sent out by our univer
sities and colleges not only the counselors of
their fellow-countrymen, but the tribunes of
the people, fully appreciating every condition
that presses upon their daily li.'c, sympathetic
in every untoward situation, quick and earnest
iv c"very effort to advance their happiness and
welfare, and prompt and sturdy in the de
fense of all their rights.
I have but imperfectly expressed the
thoughts to which I have not been able to
deny utterance on an occasion so full of glad
significance and so pervaded by the at
mosphere of patriotic aspiration. Born of
these surroundings the hope cannot be vain
that the time is at hand when all our country
men will more deeply appreciate the bless
ings of American citizenship, when their dis
interested love of their Government will be
quickened, when fanaticism and passion shall
be banished from the field of politics, and
when all our people, discarding every differ
ence of condition or opportunity, will be teen
under the banner of American brotherhood,
marching steadily and unfalteringly on to
ward the bright heights of our National des
tiny.
After the formal exercises of the se-qui
centennial wtre over a reception was ten
dered to President and Mrs. Cleveland at
Prospect, and over a thousand of the
alumni and guests of the university en
joyed the privilege of taking the Presi
dent by the hand.
At 3 o'clock the President and party
were escorted to the station by the Phila
delphia troops, when the train to which
was attached the President's private car
left for Washington.
In the evening a banquet was given to
the visiting delegates, prominent alumni
and the lacalty of the university in the
Casino building.
CORBETT'S WIFE DEPARTS.

special from Montreal, says:
James J. Corbett is here playing with
his company. He and his wife had a row
!a*t night at the Windsor Hotel,
which will likely result in their
separation. An anonymous letter
was received by Mrs. Corbet t, and
w hen Corbett got to the botel yesterday
his wife charged him with unfaithfulness
;ind immediately there was a row. Din
ner was served in their parlors and plates
were minor weapons.
Corbett left in disgust, so he says, and
the Windsor constable says he saw the
champion run. At balf-past 6 Corbett re
turned, only to find that his wife had left
for New York.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1896.
HEIDY TO TRUST
OLD UNCLE SAM
Venezuela Not Prepared to
Make Concessions to
England.
Free and Full Arbitration May,
However, Be Eventually
Agreed Upon.
COMMISSIONERS VERY BUSY.
Within a Short Time They Will
Report Relating to the Vexed
Boundary Dispute.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 22.-The
Venezuelan Minister. Senor Andrade,
made a call lasting about an hour on the
Secretary of State to-day, but declined to
divulge the nature of the interview. It is
well understood, however, that if the pro
posals which Sir Julian Pauncefote is said
to be bringine from Lord Salisbury offer
an impartial arbitration of the boundary
dispute or the elision of any part of Vene
zuela's claims as a compromise substitute
for Secretary Olney's plan tor adjudicat
ing the entire controversy, the Venezuelan
Government will decline to accept arbitra
tion on any such terms. The attitude of
complete confidence reposed by Venezuela
in the American Boundary Commission's
determination is declared to be absolutely
unchanged and Venezuela ha 3 determined
to await the commission's decision, now
expected early in December, unless Eng
land in the meantime consents to a refer
ence of the entire question to an impartial
tribunal.
Intimation has reached official quarters
here that England may eventually con
sent to free and full arbitration, with,
however, the same stipulation which was
imposed upon Nicaragua in the ultimatum
of which the Coriuto affair was the
climax, and which, after demanding
smart money for injures to Consul Hatch
in the Mosquito affair, proposed the ref
erence of other claims to a tribunal of
which each of the members should be
"not a citizen of any American State."
Venezuela, it is said, as an evidence of
her confidence in the integrity of her
claim, might be willing to consent to this
unusual stipulation, and the United
States, after the precedent set in the
Mosquito affair, would hardly be in a po
sition to advise any other course.
The Venezuelan counsel before the high
commission â James J. Storrow of Boston
âreached Washington yesterday and is
putting the final touches to the Venezue
lan argument. The first part of Mr. Stor
row's brief relatine to the Schomburgk
line wa3 published last summer. Secre
tary Mallett, provost of the commission,
received a cablegram yesterday from Pro
fessor Burr, who was on the point of sail
ing on the Teutonic for home. Professor
Burr is bringing the final installment of
evidence to be considered by the commis
sion.
With the receipt of the valuable docu
ments discovered in The Hague archives
by Professors Burr and De Haan, and the
revised translations from originals made
by the latter report, some of which are
expected to throw new light on the earlier
phases of lh*, controversy, the commission
will be in a position to rapidly conclude
its labors and draw up its report to the
President, accompanied by its map Dear
ing "the true divisional line."
Whatever foundation there may be for
the belief that the minds of all the Com
missioners are made up on the question,
the final definite consideration cannot be
reached until Professor Burr's report is
examined. Those who have transactions
with the Commissioners and who are
aware of the character of the evidence,
which has been considered most im
portant, express the opinion that the de
cision will not agree with the extreme
claims of either contestant.
NEW YORK. N. V., Oct. 22.â Sir Julian
Pauncefote, British Embassador to the
United States, arrived on the steamer Ger
manic to-day. Sir Julian when inter
viewed at quarantine declined to discuss
international matters.
SLAIN BY AN ASSASSIN.
Hamlin J. Andrus Met a Hor
. rible Dsath at th? Hands
of a Fiend.
Fearful Ingenuity D splayed by the
Plotter in Explo.ing an Infernal
Contrivance.
YONKERS, N. V., Oct. 22. -The latest
developments in the terrible traeedy of
yesterday at the Arlington Chemical
Works prove almost beyond doubt that
Hamlin J. Andrus met a horrible death at
me hands of an incarnate assassin. The
plot that resulted in the murder of Mr.
Andrti3 was unquestionably deeply laid
and the plotter evidently an ingenious
rascal.
In searching the building to-day for evi
dence this was made manifest. Near the
window where the bomb was exploded
was found a coil of wire. Close scrutiny
showed that the wire had run down
through a hole In the floor used for the
gaspipe Into the cellar. There, directly
under where Mr. Andrus was found, were
four small dry batteries to which the
wires were attached.
Both the wires and the batteries were
new, and showed evidence of having been
recently placed in position. A thorough
investigation of this contrivance seemed
to prove beyond doubt that Mr. Andrus
was murdered deliberately. The wires
ran along the cellar wall, near the ceiling,
occasionally being twisted around the
steampipe to keep them in place, to the
wall at the rear end of the celiar and over
to the wall opposite and thence to an old
fashioned furnace.
Here ihe ineenuity of the assassin dis
played itself. To a protrudinp bolt on one
end of the furnace was fastened one of the
wires, an end of about four feet hanging
below. From the end of tnis wire he
clumsily scraped oft about two inches of
the insulation, with which he formed a
loop, leaving inside the loop about an
inch of the insulation.
Then he took the end of the other wire
and made a similar loop, joining the two
together. To the second wire was attached
a string about twenty feet long, to tho
center oi which was fastened a piece of
sheetiron weighing several pounds. Over
a nail near the window this ttring was
passed 50 it could be worked from the
outside. I. When the string was held taut it
drew the lood of the ; second wire up
against? the | insulation the first wire,
thus making it non-conductive. f - .
When the string was let go the weight
brought the second wire in contact and a
circuit was created. As the wires led up
to the office and connected with the bomb,
it was easy for ; the assassin to s explode 'it

from the â  window where > this * cord was
worked, it is "' believed -, that ?. the
murderer.was- familiar with bis routine
duties and was weil aware that .Mr.'An
drus was in the room when the bomb was
set off. It is pretty clearly established
that, whoever constructed the bomb and
devised the electrical contrivance knew a
great deal abont explosives and something
about i* electricity. I * But I the . stringing of
the wires and the connections made clearly
show the novice. ,' f :- ; 1
The Coroner has taken possession of all
the matter and believes it will eventually
lead to the capture of the assassin. , The
latest developments dispute the theory
that the bomb was in ended for John E.

The Pinkerton men are working on a clew
which shows a motive for the taking of
Hamlin J. Andrus' life. , : : ,

LOSS OF THE SHIP ROSENFELD.
Captain Dunphy Arrives in Port and Tells
the Story of the Disaster Off
Cape Horn.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 22.â Captain
W. H. Dunphy of the American ship Wil
lie Rceivfeld, which sprang a leak off
Cape Horn and sank while trying to make
the Brazilian Coast, was a passenger on
the steamer Newton, from Santos, which
arrived this afternoon.
Captain Dupphy said he was near Cape
Horn when he experienced a severe north
east eale, during which the ship sprang a
leak. After weathering the gale the leak
was found to be of sueti a serious nature
as to render it hazardous to proceed, and
Captain Dnnphy shaped his course for the
Falkland Islands. Heavy weather and
strong bead winds were experienced a.nd
it was impossible to make headway, so
Captain Dunphy headed for Rio de
Janeiro.
When he was within 500 miles of that
port a strong (tale sprang up and the
heavy sea made the Rosenfeld labor
heavily, and the leak became worse.
Finally a new leak was discovered In an
other part of the ship and it was decided
to run for shore, but the leak gained so
rapidly that the boats were made ready,
and she was abandoned.
Two hours afterward she sanK. The
three boats in which the crew embarked
were separated during the fir3t night out.
Captain Dunphy, with the lifeboat and
twelve men headed for the nearest
coast, distanced about 400 miles, and
landed eight days later at Invituba,
Brazil. The first mate's boat with seven
men also landed a few days later, but the
second mate's boat with seven men had
not been heard from at the time the cap
tain sailer! by the Newton from Santos.
The xtosenfeld was a large wooden ship
of 2353 n i t tons. She was built in 1885 at
Bath, Me., and was owned principally by
Arthur Sewall, the candidate for the Vice-
Presidency. Captain Dunpny also owned
a share in the vessel, as did al-o his
brother. The boat was not insured.
The Rosenfeld sailed from New York for
San Francisco April 28 with a great cargo
valued at $100,000. She foundered on
August 13.

PLEADS GUILTY
OF THE THEFTS
The Unfortunate Mrs. Castle
Makes Confession to
Dr. Savage.
But She Cannot Explain Why
. She Committed t. c Very
Strange Acts.
IMPOETANT MEDICAL EVIDENCE
Testimony of the Expert Physician
May Do Much Toward Clearing
the Accused.
LONDON, Eng.. Oct. 22.â The Castle
case, which has already been prolific of
sensations, produced anothor one to-day,
when it was admitted that Mrs. Castle
had made a full confession that she bad
taken t;.e things found in her trunks, but
claimed not to be responsible.
This confession was made during a long
examination to which she was subjected
by Dr. George Henry Savage, one of the
leading British experts cm mental dis
eases.
Altbough he secured this confession
from her, Dr. Savage's examination was
on the whole favorable to the prisoner.
He was with her for four hours and in
vestigated her mental condition with the
utmost thoroughness. As a result he is
prepared to go on the witness-stand and
swear that Mrs. Castle was not responsible
for her deeds. So high is the reputation
of Dr. Savage that his testimony will have
the greatest weight with the jury, and
since they have learned his opinion the
friends of the Castles are feeling much
more confident than they have felt during
the last few days.
It was during this examination that
Mrs. Castle admitted that she had taken
the different articles that she was accused
of stealing, but said that she could not tell
why she had done so; that she had felt an
overpowering desire that she could not re
sist. She broke down while making this
admission and seemed greatly affected.
Lewis Meiil, a watch manufacturer of
Hatton Garden, one of the sureties on the
bonds for Mr. and Mrs. Castle, is authority
for this statement, which he made to a
correspondent of the United Press this
morning.
J. R. Roosevelt, first secretary of the
United States embassy, informed a repre
sentative of the United Associated Presses
to-day that he had an interview with the
Castles yesterday. He said that Mr. Cas
tle mignt possibly make a written state
meat on behalf of himself and wife to
day. Rsosevelt said that the American
embassy would not interfere in the cass,
and was merely watching its progress.
Roosevelt received the appended letter
to-day :
Dear Sir: These lines, expressive of my
' gratitude, should have been in your posses
sion long ere this, but during the past two
weeks my mental strain has been such as to
completely unbalance me, thus incapacitating
me from giving expression to my feelings iv
writing. The most difficult task of my life is
to frame woras with which I can even in the
smallest degree express my feelings ot heart
felt gratitude for the disinterested kindness
which has been showered upon me by the hon
orable gentlemen of the United States em
bassy and by a seemingly unlimited number
of friends in' London and in America, who have
flocked to my assistance, and to whom I owe a
debt of gratitude which cannot be liquidated
in the course of a lifetime.
The more I think of the loving care with
which 1 have been wntchea over and protect
ed during these days of misforture the less
can f comprehend how it is possible that a
man comparatively unknown and thousands
of miles away from his birthplace and home
can awaken such an avalanche of sympathy
and secure the disinterested support and
friendship of such a large number of promi
nent men of both great nations as has been mv
marvelous good iortune. I have no words that
can sufficiently thank you, gentlemen of the
Unite i States embassy, iind each and every
one of my kind friends lor their truly wonder
ful devotion to me and mine during thisdread
ordeal.
My only claim to this kind protection is that
I have never committed a dishonorable action
in my past life or in the present instance, or
with the help of the Almighty will 1 ever do
aught different in the future. Kindly re
questing you, my dear Mr. Roosevelt, to un
dertake for me the task of seeing that every
one of my sympathetic friends shall know of
my heartfelt appreciation of every kindness
expressed for me and every service rendered
for me, and begging you will convey a full
char* of my devotion and heartfelt thanks to
the United States embassy in London and all
of the United States officials, as well as the
California State officials who have so nobly
come forward in defense of my honor, believe
me, I remain yours most r^pectfully,
Walter M. Castle.
Clerkenwell sessions, to which Mr. and
Mrs. Castle wer* committed for trial at
their hearing last Tuesday, will begin
November 2, and their 2<Â«Â»e will be

Center.
PROTECTION VS. FREE TRADE.
Hog, Corn, Lumber, Egg and Other In
dustries Contrasted With That
of Silver.
FERNDALE. Cal., Oct. Ferndale,
the great dairy . center of Northern Cali
fornia, was alive to-night with hosts of
people for miles around, who came to hear
the eloquent ex-Governor George ,C.
Perkins and Congressman Barham in sup
port of McKinley, sound money and pro
tection. A grand torchlight procession
paraded tne streets, anvils were fired and
huge streamers with appropriate emblems
were suspended, in numbers across the
streets. It was the greatest demonstra
tion ever witnessed in the history of this
place. â¢
The large Hall of Records, where the
speaking took place, could not accommo
date half. The meeting was opened by E.
C. Damon, candidate for the Assembly
" from the Third District; Judge J. A.
Stidger, J. C. Bull Jr. and Peter Early,
vice-presidents. The procession and
meeting had two bands. After a few ap
propriate remarks by the chairman of the
meeting, Hon. J. A. Barham was intro
duced, receiving an ovation. Following
is a synopsis of his speech :
It is not more money we want, but an op
portunity to earn some of the money which Is
already coined. Protection affords the oppor
tunity. .Under protection two -employers seek
one wage-earner. Under free trade two wage
earners seek one employer. Suppose you coin
silver so that it will reach from the earth to
the skies, how will you get any of it except by
working for it? Money must be earned by
labor, and why should not a laborer receive as
good a dollar as any other person on earth?
He compared the industries of the
country and showed that silver is one of
the smallest in the United States. He
illustrated by the hog, corn, marble, lum
ber and other industries, showing the in
significance of .the silver business. Con
tinuing, he said: .
The egg industry amounts to four times the
output of silver, and the old hen is still
scratching for a living and she is not cackling
before the doors of Congress to have her fruit
stamped by the United States Government
i to raise its value. You cannot legislate value
into anything. If Congress could fix the value
of anything then it could establish the value
of hogs, grain and other products and com
modities. The ratio between gold and sil
ver can never be permanently - fixed dv. the
Government- alone, as it has ever been chang
ing. At first it was 1 to 1, the metals were
equally precious, but as the output of silver
became greater than gold the ratio changed in
obedience to the law of supply and demand.'
It has fallen from 16 to 1 to 32 to 1, the present
â  commercial ratio. The only possible way to
, maintain a fixed ratio is by an international
agreement between the leading nations of the
world. V
He showed that Jefferson demonetized
the silver of our daddies in 1806 by sus
pending the free coinage of the standard
' dollar, and that it continued suspended
for thirty years and through Jackson's
term, he said. Did anybody ever accuse
these great men of a crime in the demone
tization of silver? Not a bit of it. ,
His speech was remarkable throughout
for simplicity and was the most convincing
exposition of the silver question ever made
.in Northern California. It was received
with great enthusiasm and will carry this
connty by 1000.
At the close of Mr. Barham's speech ex-
Governor Perkins spoke. He dealt mostly
with the tariff, giving home illustrations
of the. evil effects of the Wilson-Bryan
bill; showed that the wool industry had
depreciated under free trade $150,000,000-
enoujrh to construct the Nicaragua*canal
and build : ten battle-ships. He showed a
loss to the farmer of over $1,300,000 in cat
tle alone in one year under the Wilson bill;
also a great loss in the dairy and cheese
. business, in which the people of this sec
â¢ tion are much interested.
He made a most masterly presentation
of the tariff question, which is the great
paramount issue before the peoDle. He
deprecated the Bryanite appeal to arouse
one portion of our fellow-countrymen
against another and said there are no
classes in this countryâ each man is equal
before the law and all are in the enjoy
ment of religious and civil liberty.
The opportunities afforded to all
American / citizens is unparalleled â  in
i the history of the world. Here a
â  motherless boy, without money and with
; out friends, bad risen from arailsplitter to
the highest position in the gift of a great
and free people. The opportunities under
American law and American equality had
given this country Abraham Lincoln, J.
A. Garfield and D. S. Grant. Patriots and
men' who love their country spurn any
eflort to array a feeling of hatred among
fiiis great American people.
Repaid a high tribute to woman, and
. hoped that the people of California would
coafer upon her tha only right now denied
â the right to cas: her vote at the bal
lot-box. His address was received with
the greatest enthusiasm. v 3g!@SÂ£ggagfeg3JJ
It can be truly said that two of the
greater/, and most convincing speeches

MAJOR KYLE AT YORT BRAGG.
Addresses a Large and Enthusiastic
Meeting of Republicans.
FORT BRAGG, Cal., Oct. 22. â The
most enthusiastic meeting of the cam
paign was held at this place last evening
under the management of the McKinlev
and Hobart Club, the sneaker of the even
ing being Major C. W. Kyle of San Fran
cisco. Red Men's Hall, the largest au
ditorium in the county, was packed to the
doors by an audience which listened at
tentively for two hours to Major Kyle's
eloquent and unanswerable arguments
in favor of the great principles advo
cated by the Republican party and his
perfect exposition of the fallacious issues
which are being forced upon the people by
the Bryanites. The statements made in a
speech by the Democratic nominee for
Congress at this place a few evenings pre
vious were completely refuted, and an elo
quent tribute was paid to J. A. Barham
for his excellent labors in Congress in be
half of tne people of this district.
A pleasing incident occurred during
Major Kyle's address. A committee repre
senting the high school and normal
claÂ«ses of the Fort Bragg schools presented
the major with three beautiful bouquets.
The major paused in his argument to
thank the committee and paid a glowing
tribute to our rising generation and our
schools, showing how our youth may rise
to the eminence that McKinley is sure to
attain after the 3d of November. A tre
mendous outburst of applause from the
multitude followed. Much good will re
sult from Major Kyle's speech for protec
tion and sound money.

TRIUMPH FOR SAN DIEGO
Judge Torrance Sustains the Le
gality of the Recently Issued
Water Bonds.
The Case Stubbornly Fought by the
Flame Company to Preserve
Its Monopoly.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 23.â Judge Tor
rance to-day decided in favor of the city
in the case brought by Albert Meyer and
others to have the recently voted water
bonds declared illegal. The city on June
27 voted to issue $1,500,000 bonds for the
purchase of a water right of 1000 inches
and the construction of a distributing
system.
A contract was entered into with the
Southern California Mountain Water
Company to purchase the water right and
to secure a guarantee from the company
to bid a certain figure for the construction
of the plant. The plaintiffs contended
that the city had no right to enter into
such a contract and that the company
could not fulfill it A great many points
were involved, some of them constitu
tional.
Judge Torrance holds that the city had
the right to enter into the contract, that it
is valid and binding on 'both parties, and
that the bonds voted to carry out the con
tract are valid. He says that as the
charges of dishonesty, bribery and illegal
voting have been voluntarily withdrawn
by the parties making them it is con
ceded that the action of the Council
and the election were honest and the
expression of the will of the voters
fairly and honestly given. Therefore, the
courts have no right to stand in the way
of the will of the people unless it is shown
that the law lias been violated in materia'
points. He finds that this is not the case.
Tde city has acted within constitutional
limits, the procedure has been legal and
binding upon both parties and the propo
sition carried by more than a two-thirds
vote of the people, so that the bonds are
unquestionably valid.
The decision is regarded as a great
triumph for the city, as the case was stub
bornly fought by the San Diego Flume
Company, which is now supplying the
city, and is naturally averse to losing its
monopoly.
SAN DIEGO STEAMSHIP LINE.
Will Run From That Port to Mexico and
Central America.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 22. -John H.
Bullock, general manager of G. S. Kira
ball it Co., who propose to put on a line
of steamers between San Francisco and
San Diego and Mexican and Central
American ports, is here making final ar
rangements for wharfage facilities with the
Santa Fe Railroad Company. Arrange
ments are already completed wiih pilots,
who state that port charges will not be
allowed to stand in the way ol the com
pany making this port a stopping place.
Arrangements with the Santa Fe provide
for the same rate between Los Angeles
and San Diego as between San Pedro and
Los Angeles. A recent meeting of citizens
in Los Angeles held for the ostensible
purpose of inducing the Pacific Mail to
call at Santa. Monica is believed to be a
move of the Pacific Mail itself, with a view
of discouraging competition.
Mr. Bullock will go south to Mexican
ports from here.
Watkins Committed at San lilego.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 22.â Jefferson I.
Watkins, who was arrested last night by
Deputy United States Marshal Oakes,
charge d with falsifying the accounts of
the Farmers' National Bank at Ports
mouth, Ohio, to the Comptroller of the
Currency at Washington, was regularly

day from Cincinnati that bail of $30,000

Decision of the Executive Com

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cat,., Oct.
-2. â The executive commntee made its
decision last evening in regard to the
northern trip of t!ie Glee and Mandolin
â¢ Cl lib, and, as heretofore stated in The
Call, Mie decision gave Jittle satisfac
tion to the musical club members. The
decision and proposition made to the
musical club was that they snuiild be
Allowed to make the trip provided they
i â¢ . y < if In the meantime tbe deficiency of
C somt $4(30 incurred in their Southern Cali
fornia tour last spring and put up $'25 per
man forfeit, to go toward making up any
deficiency they may incur in such pro
posed trip, the forfeit to be refunded in
â  case of the financial success of the trip.
The ire of the Glee and Mandolin Club
men was aroused and ther insisted that
such a proposition was unfair; that they
would undertake to pay off all past in
debtedness before leaving, but they re
- fused absolutely to put up such forfeit,
â¢ claiming that it was more than the stu
dent body demanded of the football men
or other student organization?. They
offered facts and figures of their ovrn to
show that beyond a reasonable doubt
they would make a profit for the student
body treasury.
On the other hand, the executive com
mittee insisted that if they were so sure of
making money, then as their guarantee
â¢would be refunded they should have no
objection to granting the evident body
that security; that the student associa
tion had found the musical club a los-ing
proposition last year and they had no in
trntion of taking chances again, and that
certain faculty member 3 had given notice
tliat unless the debt airainst tl:e associated
students was materially reduced this year,
there would be stringent reeulations
% a-.-ainst expenses next year in all branches,
rsnecia/ly in football.
Tl.e musical men and their partisans
argued, nn.i finding it of no use deter
mined to appeal to the student body, and
a meetins: will be called to-morrow to set
. tie t tie matter. As both sides are active
and are buttonholing all etiulent voters
the meeting promises to be most vigor
ous. The musical ciubs, if they do not
succeed in overturning the executive com
* mittee'.s ruling, are in favor of withdraw
ing from student body control, but here
a^iiin the matter rests with the student
Msociation and will require constitutional
change. Should they succeed in disen
tangling themselves from student body
control they still have tue faculty com
imittee to win over, as the consent of that
*Vcmmittee must be obtained before any
organization of students can eive an ex
hibition as a Stanford organization. One
of the faculty members this afternoon ex
pressed himself as opposed to risk of any
lurther indebtedness, and in favor of nny
reasonable proposition for preventing
surh risks.
Tins afternoon Edwin James '9S was
elected by the athletic committee as base
ball manager for the coming season.
James ij a popular civii engineering
student here and plays the game himself.
He is a big l!W-po!ind man and is this
year trying for the Yarsit}' football team,
and making an excellent showing. He is
a resident of Paso Robles.
The same committee elected Dave
Brown '97 as track manager for the year.
At the present time Brown is football
manager, and the most efficient man who
ever held the position. He has previously
served as track manager, also as track
captain, and is well fitted, therefore, to
look out for Stanford's interests. He bas
been close! y identified with the college's
athletics ever since his entry here and is
one of the most popular men at Stanford.
His major also is civil engineering, and j
he comes from Oakland.
There is a possibility that the schedule {
of football games to be played will be {
somewhat altered, owing to Reliance's J
proposed trip. They desire to play Stan- I
lord October 24 instead of November 7. j
This would bring tiifl Olympic vs. Stan- !
fnrd game on October 31 and the freshman |
game November 7. As it would require I
some rearrangement of the Berkeley i
schedule it is nÂ«>t yet known whether the I
change will be made.
"THE GATHERING STORM"
JG. Cadenasso's Powerful Picture
\ Which Has Surprised -
People.
It Is a Splendid Impression of Tragedy
in Nature and Looks Like
lines' Painting.
The friends and admirers of G. Cade-
Jiasso, the artist, have been taken wholly by
surprise with his latest painting, "The
Gathering Storm." Mr. Caaenasso has
been a tireless and conscientious student
Cadenasso's Picture of a Tragic Mood of Nature.
of nature for years past, since he first di
verted his ihought from portrait and still
life work to landscape painting, and with
what success his endjsavors to produce
yoniethiiiÃ that would cause people to
talk about it may be seen Id tnis particu
lar picture.
In hisÂ«studio on Post street, one may
trace the artist's steady climbing upward
in his portrayal of natureâ a branch of
work which is, totally distinct from the
already mature results in portraiture and
tne studies of still life and genre. Through
the various moods of nature there is not
only a clear evidence of development of
thought and feeling and technique, but ;t
is plainly to be seen that the arti-t has re
ceived many delightful impressions, and
these are presented with increasing power
until the climax is reached in "The Gather
ins Storm."
A characteristic feature of Mr. Cade
nasso's painting is its "outdoor" quality.
He has painted considerable in the open
air with the result that his sketches and
finished pictures alike are full of
sunii.'ht and real, living, vibrating atmos
phere. In explaining this sunlit brilliancy
and atmosphere effect the artist says very
modestly: "I like to paint and study in
the open air because I get the true effect,
which is not possible in the studio."
"The Gathering Storm" is full of this
quality, which, combined, of course, with
the impression of tragedy in the elements,
makes itself apparent in the overhanging
heaviness. This picture is on a large can
vas. It represents an opening in the
woods where cattle are grazing near a
daikening pond. In the foreground there
are rich grass and to the left a cluster of
majestic tree*, while Deyond the open
sward, sits a farmhonse flooded with a rift
of sunshine that lights up the center pro
fusely. Behind this the trees are in deeD
shadows and the sky is dark and threat
ening where the storm is brewing. The
picture in pitched In a strong, dark key
which affords a nice relief for vivid creens
and warm touches of color. Artists who
haveseen the picture have complimented
the painter oa it, so that it is highly prob
able il;:it henceforth Mr. Cadenasso's
landscapes will be in demand.
TALE OF A MAGIC TREE
Colonel Nolan Discovers a Vege-
table Fountain of Eternal
Youth.
The Hawaiian Papoya Tree Make?
o'd Roosters as Tender as
Young Broilers.
Colonel George A. Nolan of Los
Anceles. formerly Public Administrator
of Kansas City, a manufacturer and man
of extensive travel, tells an interesting
story of the Hawaiian papaya plant or
tree. He has just made investigations
that lead him to believe that it embodies
many of the virtues heretofore supposed
to dwell in the fabled fountain of immor
tal youth.
Speaking of the marvelous tree that pro
duces papaya fruit Colonel Nolan last
night said:
"This tree brings forth a strange-looking
melon fruit, not unlike a mushmelon.
The juice of the fruit possesses the quality
of dissolving meat, having a strange effect
on muscular libers, apparently disinte
grating them completely. Colonel John
Browler of Honolulu showed me a tough
chicken whi^h became as tender as a
young Droller when boiled for a few min
utes in water to which a few drops of the
papaya juice bad been added. If the
natives are to be believed the same effect
is obtained by hanging a tough fowl or
ihe meat of" a bullock under the tree
in such a way that the exhalations of pa
pmine permeate the meat. Great surprises
have been perpetrated on visitors toy
natives inclined to be wags by making a
tough piece of meat tender in a few min
utes by passing it through water made
strong withpopaine, pretending, however,
to achieve the purpose by an incantation
to the Goddess Peie.
"It is a marvelous fact that one soon
becomes accustomed to eating the fruit,
whicu cures dyspepsia and auds to one's
general health."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1896.
DURRANT'S BRIEF
NOT SUBMITTED
Attorney- General Fitzger
ald on the Famous
Appeal.
He Gave Notice That the Case
Wculd Come Up in Los
Angeles.
ORDER MAY BE MODIFIED.
Durrant's Attorneys Express Cocfi
dence That Their Numerous
Points Will Bs H?ard.
Attorney-General Fitzcerald said yester
day, concerning the order of the Supreme
Court, in session at Los Anueles. to sub
mit the appeal of Theodore Durrant lor
decision without briefs, that the action of
the court has not surprised him.
"I notified General Dickinson," said
Attorney-General Filzjjerald, "that I
wanted to have the appeal disposed of by
the Supreme Court during the Los Angeles
session. I did not want to have the case
drag along and was fully determined to
proceed, ilr. Anderson, Assistant Attor
ney-General, has stated facts correctly to
the Supreme Court under a request for in
formation. The facts are as follows:
"The transcript on appeal was filed by
Durrant's attorneys July Â£9. Under the
rule of the court they had ten days in
which to file their brief. On August 7,
one day before the time for tiling the brief
had expired under the rule, the court or
dered that twenty days' more time be
given. I had previously refused to grant
tho extension desired by counsel. The
order of the court gave the attorneys un
til August 28 to make their filing. They
have never filed their brief with the court.
"I have never had any understanding
with Durrant's counsel more than this:
General Dickinson came to me to ask for
further time. lat first refused to agree to
that, but subsequently did say that if the
brief should be put in within ten days that
would be all right. That put the matter
over until September 7. Some install
ments of a brief were handed to me in
type-written copy, but not all. I told
General Dickinson emphatically that tho
matter must be disposed of and would be
disposed of at Los Angeles.
"There were two things for them to do
at Los Angeles. One was to aubmit the
appeal on brief, and the other was to have
made an oral argument if they so wished.
They have taken neither course. Ido not
wish it understood that I blame the attor
neys. At tho same lime I wish it fully
understood that I made known to them
just what they might expect.
"The court can of course modify or set
aside the order for the submission of the
appeal without briefs. That is entirely
within the discretion of the court When
I notified Dnrrant's counsel about the
master, ail iliat I wanted was to get In
their appeal early enough to lot me file a
brief answer in time for the Los Angeles
session. I would never have objected to
their nline a brief, even if long after the
ten days allotted, but that has not been
done."
The action of the Supreme Court has in
terested Dnrrant and his counsel alike, for
Durrant's attorneys have been at worK
preparing 235 points of error which they
consider important. They have reduced
140 exceptions to the proceedings during
Durrant's trial in the Supreme Court to
writing. Eugene N. Deuprey said yester
day that he believed that the Supreme
Court will give time for counsel to com
plete tbeir brief, upon which both he and
peneral DicKinson have worked. This
means that the facts will be fully presented
to the Supreme Court, which may act dif
ferently when a life is at stake than might
be the case under other circumstances.
A condensed history of the Dnrrant case
up to date is as follows : Information filed
against Dnrrant May x 2, 1895; verdict
found November 1, 1895; sentence of death
pronounced December 6, 1895; rrotice of
appeal riled Decemoer 9, 1895; traoscript
on appeal filed in the Supreme Court July
29, JB9G; court gave twenty days from
August Bto file points and authorities;
writ of probable cause granted by Chiei
Justice Beatty September 5, 1896. The
records of the Supreme Court have no i
entry showing thai a brief on appeal has
been filed, for none has been placed on
file.
the order of the Supreme Court,
which, if not modified or set aside, would
shutout from consideration by the court
the 235 points of errors upon which Dnr
rent bases the hope that his life may be
spared, or that be may have another
chance for his life, the general opinion of
lawyers is that the court will li3ten to any
presentation thnt Messrs. Dickinson anil
Deuprey may offer and show clemency.
Mr. Deuprey says that counsel have
been as diligent as possible in the prepara
tion of their brief on appeal. The arrange
ment with Attorney-General Fitzgerald
was that the Attorney-General should be
served with advance sheets of the brief,
and this has been dene as far ai the work
has progressed. General Dickinson has
been' assisted by other attorners and the
brief contains strong points. There were
2410 pages to go over and be carefully re
viewed, and it was utterly impossible that
any sucli amount of work could be per
formed in ten or twenty days.
Durrant expressed little anxiety when
told of the news from Los Angeles. He
â said thnt he felt secure and had confidence
in his attorneys.

TAPPING OFFICIALS.
The Latest Democratic Campaign
Document*
There are many documents which require considerahle explanation, but the fol
lowing explains itself so well that no illustration is needed. It was sent through the
mails to a Federal official in tnis City. It is now in order for some one to explain
away tbe Federal law makinc v a crime to assess cffice-holders for political purposes:
San Francisco, Oct. 15, 1896.
Dear Sir:
Feeling that you have an inter
est in seeing the Democratic administration
in the United States perpetuated, and to
that end are anxious that the Democratic
ticket be successful in the coming election,
it has been decided to ask of you a volun
tary subscription toward the legitimate and
necessary expenses of the present campaign.
It is trusted that your patriotic sentiments
and sound Democracy will prompt .you to re
spond without delay.
This being a Presidential election, con
tributions should be more liberal than where
only the interests of one State are involved.
Having often been asked our opinion, it has
been decided that three per cent of a yearly
salary would be a reasonable and fair con
tribution.
If your circumstances are such that you
cannot contribute this amount, any reason
able contribution will be thankfully re
ceived.
Those who are not receiving a pecuniary
benefit from the fact that we have d Demo
cratic administration cannot be expected to
contribute, when no contributions have been
received from those who are enjoying the di
rect benefit cf the administration. Do not
force us to the conclusion by your silence
that you consider the proposition unfavor
ably, but let us hear from you at once.
This committee has, up to the* present
time, received far less than enough to pay
the legitimate expenses of an economical cam
paign, and far less than has ever been placed
at the disposal of any State Committee here
tofore.
I enclose you herewith a copy of the
opinion of our legal committee, the original!
of which I hold at this office.
Yours respectfully,
(Signed) William H. Alford,
Chairman.
ARE NOT IN POLITICS,
Several Real Estate Firms Re-
pudiate the New Asso
ciation.
The Use of Their Names as Officers
Was Entirely Unau
tber z d.
Not all the real estate iirms of the City
have joined the "Real Estate Agents' and
Property-owners' Association." â¢ In fact,
tbe leading iirms in that line have not
only not done so. but yesterday they- laid
siege to newspaper offices begging that
tbe public be informed that "hey repudi
ate the whole affair.
F. J. Haruies of Madison & Burke, ac
coiding to the reports given out the day
before, had been elected to the office oi
first vice-president of the new organiza
tion.
"I had nothing to do with it and the
Whole thing was entirely unauthorized,"
said Mr. Harnies yesterday, readjusting
his hot collar. "I was not at the meeting,
was not even informed that it wa3 to take
place. Do you see that stack of eleciiou
cards on my desk? AVhy, it seems to me
every spieler for every candidate running
for office has heen here a?Kin^ me to have
the association indorse hi* man. As I un
derstand it, irom wlmt 1 have learned to
day, the candidates to be indorsed by the
association are required to put uj> $10
each. It looks to me like a lnero piece
club and this tirm wants nothing to do
with it, and further than that, it is very
nir.ch disgusted at having its name used
in any snch connection.
"I went to see Mr. Speck, who, besides
electing me vice-president, elected him
self president, and asked him what he
meant by it. He readily confessed, of
course, that it was an unwarranted as
sumption on his part. So I wrote out the
iollowing and had him .sign it:
San Francisco, Oct. 22, 189 G.
In justice to Mr. J. T. Hnrmes of thti firm of
Muiiison & Burke and Mr. G. H. Umbscn of the
firm of Uintaeu <fe Co., I will state that the
mention oi their names by me iv the morning
papers of to-day in conneoiiun with the so
culled Kefti Estate Protective Associntion, us
officers or members or in any connection
therewitn was wholly unauthorized.
A. M. Speck.
"Mr. Umbsen was with me equally in
dignantâin Jact Umbsen calied un me the
first tiling in the morning to learn what it
meant, and wlien lie learned that J knew
nothing about it proposed that we go and
see Speck.
"The whole thing is unwarranted, as I i
say. Speck called on me same days ago '
and axfced if 1 would take part in a move
ment looking to the association of real
estate men with a view of proiectintÂ» the
interests of their client?. I said I was I
willing to do anything that would benefit i
our clients, and that I wouid atiend any j
mcetinsr having that purpose in view. I
said, however, that nothing must be pub- j
lished in the newspapers about it. l i
wanted io learn what the proposed meas- '
ures were and how they were to be accom- i
plished first of all. The next thing I
heard of the matter was the publication
this morning. Mr. Speck's written state
mem (hat the use of my name was un
authorized explains that."
George H. Umbsen & Co. made a simi
larly indignant statement.
The iollowing communication from Yon !
Khein & Co. explains itself:
Editor San Francitco Cal'â Dear Sir: In this
morning's paper we nisd ft nonce that h num
ber Of real estaie firms have formed a society
and thai one of the objects oi this organiza
tion ig given by them iv ths followiiijt word*:
"The real estate firms of this Citr, realizing
thet the majority of trie citizens of this City
are unable la judge of the qualifications nnd
merits of the various candidates for office, who
are now seeking our knfffarei, have deemed it
for the benefit of the public at litrge, and lax
payers in general, tnat they should us â¢ every
available means in their power to invesiisaie
the various aspirants for otticcand report their
qualifications to the public in general and the
taxpayers, and to that end an oraraniz.ition
has been formed of Â«1' the i rominent real
estate firms of tnis City."
Tue tirm of O. F. yon Rheiu & Co. does not
believe that the majority of the citizens are â â 
unsbie to judge of the qualification and merits |
oi the various candidr.tes for effice and that |
they need be enlightened by the superior in- |
telligence of real estate man. We conceive !
ttmt when v gentleman places his property in
our charge we are to attend to everything tnat j
cornea within the scope of that charge, but we |
are unable to see why we ere to select the men I
lor vhoin our client shall vote. Why uot have |
the doctor, the architect, the tailor or the j
shoemaker submit a list of names to be siifi
ported by the man who employs him? Tin;
franchise is essentially a personal privilege ]
and a personal charge which may'not bj dele- I
gated to any one. No, not even to a real estate
man.
There are other objects contemplated by the i
society under consideration with which we i
are in full sympathy. V#ry truly yo:ir=,

FOB PRESIDENT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Oblo
fOB VICF-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Tom Reed is coming.
It will surely be McKinley.
Coercion is a coward's final cry. â¢â¢
Follow wheat and move upward to pros
perity. â 
Fusion began with contusion and ends
in a rout. â  _ â 
Law, order ana prosperity is the winning
battle cry.
The distinguished visitors from Maine
may count on California.
The Popocrats are on the run and now
is the time to push the pursuit.
The presence of Tom Reed will close the
campaign 4 n this City with a jubilee.
Get ready for the big parade that is to
welcome Speaker Reed to San Francisco.
What would it profit this country to
array capital against labor? Who would
benefit by it?
i
America means opportunity for every
body except the anarchist, the repudiator
and the revolutionist. " !
Discontent will end with the bad times.
Vote for McKinley and help to make
everybody prosperous.
Every coercion story has in it the ele
ments of a mystery story, for the villain
is never named und cannot be guessed.
The only way for the Bryanitesto escape
the charge of meaning anarchy is to enter
the plea that they do not mean anything.
The National flag is the only fit emblem
of National aspirations, and it is for their
realization the Republican party lives and
works. ; '_.
Mark Hanna has been called many
things, but he has never been called a
tool, and that is where he differs from
Bryan.
Remember that as goes San Francisco so
goes tbe State. If we would have our in
dustries protected we must work for Mc-
Kinley. â â 
Tbe only way to secure prosperity is to
open American mills to American labor
and make a home market for the Ameri
can farmer.
â¢ There is not half as much ignorance in
this country as the Bryanites believe.
You cannot fool many of the people even
much of the time.
When loyal Republicans and conserva
tive Democrats march together they take
up the whole road and revolutionists have
to take to the woods.
The argument for. free silver, like that
for free trade, has been abandoned and
the Popocrat coyote does nothing but
howl and howl and howl.
Republican enthusiasm rises higher
every day, and the arrival in the State of
bo great a leader a3 Speaker Reed will in- v
fuse it with an ardor nothing can resist.
, The postal-card ballot taken by the Chi
cago Record shows that Illinois will be
overwhelmingly for McKinley. There are
very few aoubtiul States in this campaign.
Â«
BacE of McKinley stands every states
man of eminence in the Nation, while
back of Bryan are . Altgel-J; Tillman,
Coxey, Debs and all the discontented
agitators known to our politics.'
No speeches oi the campaign have been
broader than those of McKinley and none
have been narrower than those of Bryan.
Judged by their words, the one is a states
man and the other is an agitator.
We are sure of victory, but we must not
stop with that. Let us make it an over
whelming one, and turn fusion into such
confusion it will never ' know where it
started in nor where it was thrown out.
The remaining days of the campaign
will be tilled with all kinds of false ru
mors and slanderous reports of coercion
and intimidation. Be on your guard
against them. No American should tole
rate such insults to American manhood.
From now on we will be told by the
Popocrat managers that some of the East
ern States will vote for Bryan, while in
the East they will be told that the WestiÃ
solid for the fusion ticket; and thus every
thing ingenuity can conceive or falsehood
can utter will be said to discourage and
disconcert the people. These are the
tactics of desperate men, and the very fact
they are used is ; a proof that those who
use them are demoralized and virtually
beaten-
THE COMING OF REED.
The Republican State Central Commit
tes has received definite information that
Speaker Reed will be in this City Satur
i.ay, October 31, and will make an ad
dress here to close the campaign for Mc-
Kinley and Hobnrt. This announcement
is in many respects the most important
news of the day. It will carry encourage
ment to every loyal Republican. It gives
premise of a wave of enthusiasm which
wiil make San Francisco sure for sound
money and protection.
It goes without saying that Repub
licans, conservative Democrats, business
men and workingmen will unite to make
Mr. Reed's arrival the occasion of the
1 r^est aud most enthusiastic political
demonstration ever witnessed on the
Pacific Coast. Never has there been a
time since the war when the people were
more in a humor for such a demonstration
o patriotic r solve than in this contest
against Bryamsm, and the presence of the
great statesman from Maine vill add to
this resolve all the fervor that flows from
the magnetic leadership of one whom all
delight to honor.
The occasion should be made some
thing more than a San Francisco
demonstration. T c City on that day
should keep open house and invite the
friends of prosperity and good govern
ment from all parts of the State to come
and take part in the welcome to Reed and
the manifestation of loyalty to McKinley
and Hobart. The street parade should
include marching clubs from ail the coun
try round, and Mr. Reed should find him
se:i the center and the object of a genuine
Californian welcome.
The time for preparation is none too
long, and everybody must lend a willing
and a helping band to the State Central
Committee in getting ready for the day.
There will be grand processions in many
if not all of the large cities of the country
on that day, and San Francisco will have
no easy task to hold her rightful rank
among them. Earnest and active work
will be necessary to make the day what it
should be, and to that work the people
must turn now.
The knowledge that Tom Reed is com
ing will be felt as an inspiration in every
Republican heart this morning. Under
the influence of that inspiration let the
work begin. Get ready to adorn your
homes and places of business with the
banners and emblems of the party of pro
tection, sound money, law, order and
National unity. In every case let the
stars and stripes fly high above all as a
symbol of the Nation against sectional
ism, of the people against class agitators
and of that patriotic resoive of Republicans
and conservative Democrats to unite in
this contest for the honor of the Republic
and the welfare of the people.
It is rather surprising; that so little
attention has been paid to the claim of
Mr. Bryan that there is a necessity for
an increase of our circulating medium,
for it is a striking fact that in France,
where the circulating medium is 836
per capita, wages are considerably
lower than in England, where the cir
culating medium is but SlB per capita,
and vastly lower than in the United
States, where the circulating medium
is 822 per capita. The supply and de
mand for labor, the cost or living, and
the profit which invested capital can
earn, determine the pay or the em
ployed and not the amount of money lv
circulation. Confidence play* an im
portant part.. It alone can bring back
the good old days of business prosper
ity, and it will not come with a 53
--cent dollar.â Hon. Timothy I*. Wood
ruff.
THE AIPEAL TO REVOLUTION.
It is now clearly evident that the tactics
of the Democratic and Populist leaders in
the closing days of the campaign will be
an appeal to the prejudices and the pas
sions of men in the hope of gaining the
votes of all who are ignorant, discontented
or envious. These appeals will take three
forma: First, McKinley will be denounced
as the slave of Mark Hanna. Second,
Mr. Hanna will be denounced as the vil
lainous leader of corrupt corporations,
and third, all corporations will be de
nounced as tho despotic coercers of the
votes of American workingmen.
All of these things taken v gether con
stitute a direct appeal to revolution. The
fusion orators and organs will decry every
thing that exists in our social order under
the forms of law, and will endeavor to
arouse tha people of one class against
those of the other â the debtor against the
creditor, the poor against the rich, labor
against capital, and every man who is dis
contented against the existing conditions
of affairs.
It is for the intelligence of the people to
combat this appeal by wise words of pat
riotism, justice and Jaw. The appeals of
the revolutionists are dangerous only be
cause we have gone through a period of
bad tunes. As soon as the election of
McKinley assures a return to tbe protec
tive system prosperity will come bacfc
and the numberof discontented people in
the community will be confined to those
who are either lazy, improv.dent, or ab
normally jealous of the prosperity of others.
Fortunately for good citizens the con
servative elements of the country have at
this time a leader peculiarly well fitted to
meet this appeal to revolution. His
earnest patriotism, capable of every sacri
fice for the Union, was demonstrated
while yet a youth by bis services in the
army. His wise regard for the welfare of
the people has been splendidly shown by
his luminous service as a statesman ever
earnest in advocating the cause of the in
dustries of all sections of the Union and
of every workingman. His record wins
for him the confidence of the people, and
his earnest and eloquent speeches
strengthen and confirm them in their
faith that all is well with the Republic
and that better times are* at hand.
While we rest confident in the assur
ance that Major McKinley will be elected
and that the threats of civil disturbance
will pass away, there should be none the
less a resolute expression of public con
demnation of the tactics of the desperate
leaders of the fusion party. This is not
the first tinif* in American history that
there has been an appeal to revolution.
The secession leaders tried it in 1860, but
the people responded to it bravely by the
election of Abraham Lincoln, and when
the revolutionists attempted to put their
threats into effect a united people rallied
to the support of tbe Nation and crushed
out once and forever the unholy cause of
sectional traitors. With an equal courage
the people of to-rtay will meet the cry of
class pr judice by t. c election of Major
McKinley, and the agitators of to-day
may profit by the experience of the agita
tors ol 1860.
Against the appeals to revolution are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1896.
the appeals to patriotism and (he bester
sentiment of the d ople. Against Bryan,
Altgeid and Tillman stand McKinley and
all the goodly company of statesmen who
support him. The American people will
not hesitate which side to choose in this
contest. They will stand lor law and
order, for truth and justice, for the com
mon interests of all, for the preservation
of the Republic and for the welfare of all
who love it, honor it and serve it.
A depreciation of the currency is al
ways attended by a loss to the labor
ing classes. This portion or the com
munity have neither timo nor oppor
tunity to watch the ebbs and flwws of
the money market. .Kngtigt d from day
to day in tholr us-ful toils, tUey do not
perceive that, although their wages are
nominally the same, or even somewhat
higher, thuy are greatly reduced in
fact by thtÂ» rapid increase of currency,
which, m i:. appears to make money
ml>- and, they are at first inclined to
consider a blessing.â Andrew Jac son.
THE DUTY OF REPUBLICANS.
It 13 Uie supreme duty of the Republi
cans of California in the present campaign
to stand solialv shoulder 10 shoulder be
hind the Republican party; to put forth
every effort in every way for its success,
and to do nothing winch might bring dis
cord to the ranks of its supporters or di
minish in the shghtef-t measure the suffi
ciency and the glory of its vsciory.
The position of honor and credit which
California may be entitled to among the
Stales which shall assist in returning the
Republican party to power largely de
pends upon the loyalty and unity with
which those who assert themselves to be
its members Mipport the party in its effort
to win for California that position.
In a military campaign it is essential
that the army shall maintain perfect har
mony and oraer among its various parts
as it approaches the battlefield where the
supreme issue is to be tried. No army
could hope for that perfection of discip
line upon which victory depends if its
officers and regiments were engaged in
daily dissensions among themselves over
the divisions of the spoils of war. In an
election campaign a similar necessity for
harmony prevails. It is the duty of every
prrson who claims to be a member of the
party to support its constitutional lead
ers and sustain its regular organ ; zation in
its every movement and its every part.
To fail or refuse to yield such obedience
and render such support would in war be
disloyalty, and it is equally so in politics.
In elections involving' locai as well a^
National results every issue and every
office are important a3 affecting the gen
eral party success, and hence in such cam
paigns the regular party organization
should be loyally sustained at every point,
and every ticket â local. State and National
â which it has regularly put forth should
be earnestly supported by every member
of the party.
The Republican party of California is
engaged in conducting such a campaign.
It has regularly selected a body of Na
tional electors pledged to vote for William
McKinley for President of the United
States. It has also, through its equally
regular subdivisions, put before the peo
ple regular Republican Congressional and
county tickets throughout the entire
State. In the Cty and County of San
Francisco the regular and legal local or
ganization has named a municipal ticKet
and has placed at its head an esteemed
citizen and a tried and faithful public ser
vant in the person of Colonel Cnarles L.
Taylor, the regular Republican nominee
for Mayor.
It is easy to discover where the path of
party duty for every loyal Republican lies-
He should sustain the regular organization
and regular nominees of his party, and
under no circumstances should he be
found disloyal to the one or unfaithful to
the other. The Rspublican party expects
every man to do his duty in this cam
paign.
The forces that are threatening the
Integrity of this country are those
which have no proper place upon our
soil. They are thn forcos of disorder
and strife. Their success means to par
alyze or destroy necessary executive
powers ; to degrade the courts, which
are the chief support of the Govern
ment, and to inflict a stain up >n the
Nation's credit which will take years
to live down.â Hon. F. S. Black.
BRYAN AND ALTGELD.
"When the present campaign began quite
a number of Democrats who disapproved
of the Chicago platform and openly de
clared their hostility to it remained in the
paity ranks and continued to support the
ticket on the ground that the men nom
inated were not so bad as the platform it
self. These men acted in accordance with
party discipline, which all Americans re
spect, and their course, inconsistent as it
was, in matters of principle, was largely
cordoned en the general belief that since
we must have a party government in this
country party regularity is by no means a
bad thing.
The speeches -of Bryan, Altgeid and
Tiiiman have, however, removed the last
ground on which these stalwart Demo
crats could stand. They now see that the
ticket is as bad as the platform and that
the men behind it are even worse; that
there is nothing of old Democracy in it
save the name, and that there is no choice
before them save to vote for McKinley or
to vote for revolution.
Two letters published yesterday make
these facts clear to every intelligent man.
One of these letters was from Coionel S.
F. Norton of Illinois declaiing Mr. Bryan
to be 1 Populist. In his letter he said :
Our political allies in this campaign may
not have treated us as fairly and justly as they
ought in the matter of representation of Vice-
Presidential electors, and tbis seems to De the
chief cause of complaint, lor I have yet to
meet with a Populist who docs not admit that
Bryan is the ablest and most fearless cham
pion of refoim principles that the reformers
themselves have chosen in the last twenty
years.
The other letter was from lion. William
Ri Morrison, < ne of the ablest leaders of
conservative Democracy, containing caus
tic criticism^ upon Governor Aitgeld and
the contrast between his actions as a pri
vate citizen and Ms leaders . Ip of the
fu-ion party. Mr. Morrison says:
If belief in the silver provision of the Chi
cago plutform is the only test of merit, what
claim has the Governor on its advocates? Hip
leases provide for the payment of rent in gold,
whether to him personally or as president of a
corporation is immaterial. They siiow that he
believes and expects free coinage will result lv
a depreciated silver doliur, and his utterances
for free coinage can have no higher purpose
than to delude those who do honestly believe
in it.
The two letters taken together give an
accurate summary of the situation. How
can any Democrat support Bryan, the Pop
uiist? How can any liee-silverite support
a ticket dominated by Altgeid, who is do
ing all he can in his business to subvert
the cause of free silv r? Is it possible
that such a combination can win the sup
port of any considerable number of intel
iinat Americans?
It is nut strange that the fusion leaders
have turned asido from the issue of
free silver as they did from the issue
of free trade. There is but one way to
support bo:h Bryan and Altgeld and
that is to appeal to prejudice and pas
sion, to cry out for revolution and to seek
to mislead such ignorance as may exist
among the American people.
Oar confidence in th - patriotism of
our people and in the strength and se
enrity of American institutions has been
more firmly established, a<Â» we have
noted the determination by so many of
our old-time political opponents to ab
jure for a season allegiance to the party
which they have done so muoli to main
tain. Welcome them at our allies in this
great conflict and rejoice that we are able
to demonstrate to the world that upon
issuer involving a stable aywtem of
finance, th.- dignity of the Nation and
the supremacy of law our people are
patriots rather than partimtne. â Ltvi I\
Morton.
WHEAT AND POPULISM.
Senator Marion Butler, chairman of the
Populist National Committee, has given
out the statement that the jump in wheat
is simply another evidence that the mar
ket to a certain extent is controlled by
speculation, and that the price of any
product thus controlled can be tempo
rarily lowered or raised at will by those
who hold the calls for future delivery.
This is another form of the oft-repeated
statement that ihe goJdbugs control the
world. The Populists and their allies
among the Democrats are trying to dis
count the effects of the rise in the price of
wheat by asserting with vehemence that
it is the work of the Republican man
agers and has been done simply for cam
paign effect. It is fortunate ti.at these
men have no weight and influence in the
markets of the world, for if what they say
should be heeded the advance in wheat,
which promises so much prosperity to
America, would be checked and our people
would be induced to cell their crops lor
much less than they are worth.
In this case the cry of "corporate
power" has pushed silliness to the ex
treme limit and reached the verge of
idiocy. The only e-ff-.-ct likely to result
from the statement of Mr. Butler is that
it will give the people a fair understand
ing of the campaign tactics of the Bryan
ite managers. It is clear they intend to
misrepresent every prospect of prosperity
and distort every sign of good times into
some appearance of corporate coercion
and goldbug manipulation. It is hardly
credible that such tactics would be found
successful even among tbe most ignorant
of the people, and it would seem that all
that is necessary to refute them is the
derisive laughter with which they will be
greeted by intelligent men in every sec
tion of the Union.

HON. S. G. HILBORN.
The Republican nominee for Congress in the Third District, Samuel Greelev Hil
born, is a native of Maine and 62 years of age. H j was educated in the common
schools â Gould's Academy, Bethel, Me., ana at Tuft's College, from which latter in
stitution he was graduated in 1859. He taught school for awhile and then began the
study of the law in tho office of Fessenden & Butler in Portland. Immediately after
his admission to the bar in 1861 he came to California, locating at Vallejo, where he
engaged in the practice of his profession. Ho represented his district in the State
Senate from 1875 to 1879, and was a member of the Constitutional' Convention during
the latter year. In 1883 he was appointed United States District Attorney for the dis
trict of California, and removed to this City, where he resided while filling the office.
He removed to Oakland in 1887, and again took up the practice of hi 3 profession.
When Joseph McKenna was commissioned by President Harrison United States Cir
cuit Judge Mr. Hil born was returned and elected to fill his unexpired term in Con
gress, but was unseated by Warren B. English, who contested his election. He was
elered to the Fifty-fourth Congress, receiving 15,795 votes against 13,103 for Warren
B. English (D ), 5162 for W. A. Vann (Pop.) and 637 for L. B. Scranton (Pro.). Mr.
Hilborn was renominaled by the Repnblican Congressional Convention, and when he
returns to Washington the acquaintance and influence which a term and a half there
has given him will prove of great value in securing legislation of special importance
to California.

THE ROAD TO THE FOORHOUSE.
American Economist.
A dispatch in the New York Tribune from
Providence, R. 1., stated that both branches of
tbe City Council oi that city bad paused a
resolution asking from the Legislature power
to devote $150,000 "to provide work for the
unemployed." It is the same old story which
we have heard over and over again since the
triumph of the iree-trade party in 1892.
Whoever heard of the need of such a resolu
tion before that? The organization of so
cieties for the purpose of providing work for
the unemployed is the one new enterprise
which owes its existence to the breaking down
of oar protective tariff system and the estab
lishment of partial free trade. It is the one
enterprise which a protective tariff will not
foster, but will kill. Vote for a protective
tariff, which pours money into the public
treasury instead of drawing it out, and which
provides work for the unemployed without
calling upon the public funds in order to keep
our idle peop c out of the poorhouse.

to take bread out of the mouths of our work
ingmen and diminish our prosperity. Our
people remember his kindness and his way of
showing his love for "humanity." They thor
oughly believe in reciprocity, and they will
return Mr. Bryan's good will by helping to re
lieve him from undertaking the arduous du
ties of the Presidency and allow him to come
back to Lincoln and trim up his lawn.

With Mercy.
The glare of bonfires reddened the sky,
rett lights painted the buildings with the
roseate glow of enthusiasm, rockets curved
nit'h up in the blue, streaking the moon
light witu a trail of fire; cheer after cheer
rang upon the quiet air and the martial
strains of a brass band brought almost ail
Judges Treadweli and Joachimsen Addressing ths Big Overflow Meeting in Rincon Hall*
tlie population of Rincon Hill out of doors
to see the fun and to partake in the excite
ment.
It was an occasion that will be long re
membered in the political history of the
Twenty-eighth Assembly District, it being
a grand rally and jollification of the dis
trict Republican club.
Several hundred voters who were un
able to get into Rincon Hall on the cor
ner or Fokom and Second streets bed an
overflow meeting outs:de between the
bonfires and the red lights and had almost
as good a time as those who were in the
ball.
The interior of the edifice wns profusely
decorated win the National colors, the
columns supporting the roof being draped
with the stars and stripes. The wall back
of the sta c was hung with the Natioual
drapery, which formed an appropriate
background for portraits of Washington,
Lincoln and Gartieid.
The following named officers of the club
were on the stace: N. H. Burnham,
president; W. S. Russeil, vice-president;
E. P. Peterson recording secretary; J. E.
Dnruin, corresponding; secretary; H. D.
Miller, treasurer; J. Fitz Jr., sergeant-at
arms.
Two policemen in attendance had as
much as they could do in forcing aside
the mass of people standing in the main
aisle in order to allow the candidates to
make their way to the platform.
Chairman Burnham call- d the meeting
to order W'th h brief speech and introduced
Coroner Hawkins as the chairman of the
nifpting.
The Coroner's speech was more cay than
grave and for that reason delighted his
hearers. He dirt not consume much time
and introduced Judge Joachimsen as the
first speaker.
Judge Jo&chimaen began by saying that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1896.
he was more of a worker than a speaker,
and that for the last thirty-five years he
had bÂ»eu a Republican, because history
showed that the prosperity ot tho country
had been fostered by the Republican
party.
There is a financial issue in this cam
paign, but there is a still greatt-r issue,
and that is that of protectionâ an issue in
which every man who works for wages
maybe enabled to have steady employ
ment at good wages. That was the issue
that was of more importance to them than
any other, because it affected their very
means of livelihood.
The speaker concluded by saying that
if elected he would carry out tne office as
he alwjivs had aud would still continue to
temt-er justice with mercy.
In response to a persistent call Judge
Treadwell, candidate for Police Judge,
took tlie platform and was received witis a
flattering barst of applause. He began by
sayipg that if elected he would be the
Judge of the people, and not of any
party. He would do his duty fearlessly
and honestly and without bias or preju
dice in either direction. If there was a
man within the sound of his voice who did
not believe he would do his duty the
speaker didn't want him to vote for
him. He was proud to say that
he was born and reared in the
City of San Francisco, and he expected to
die here. He pledced his hearers that if
he should be elected Poiice Judge he
would never give the people the sliehtest
cause for regret. He promised also that
iie would be in his office from half-past 9 in
the morning until 5 o'ciock in the after
noon, as required by law.
Edward Sweeney made a rousing speech
on behalf of the municipal ticket, and
said that the Auditorium or the regular
Republican Convention had selected the
best material possible out of which to
make up its ticket. He eulogized particu
larly the candidates for Police Judgeships,
who, he said, could be relied upon to
temper justice with mercy.
Thomas B. O'Brien, candiaate for Con-
gress from the Fourth Congressional
District, began his speech by saying that
the present campaign was remarkable
for a peculiar feature, one which he had
never observed before in his experience
of a quarter of a century in San Fran
cisco, and that was the spontaneous out
pouring of the people to attend Republi
can gatherings. It showed beyond a doubt
that the people of San Francisco and of
the State of California had received a bit
ter lesson in poverty.
Mr. O'Brien, after announcing that he
had wielded tlie pick and shovÂ«l as a
miner, said: "I have a warm spot in my
bosom lor the*men who toil and delve in
the bosom of mother earth, and I can
nssuie you to-day that no Shylock from
Wall street and no banditti from Thread
needle and Lombard streets, in London,
shall ever control the vote of Tom O'Brien
as against the honest miner."
This declaration, made with much force
and earnestness, raised a ntorru of cheers.
Then Mr. O'Brien remarked that the
south of Market street appeared to oe all
right and that he had battled for the boys
and girls of that district in 1879, when he
traveled through the State wi.h William
F. White, the workingmen's candidate
for Governor, who received 44.000 vote*.
"I am the same unalterabe Tom
O'Brien," he added, "in favor of the work
ing people, as I was in the days gone by,
and if 1 am sent to Congress I will give
you something elf-e besides the St. Vitus
dance of the jaw which my opponent has
been giving you for the last foir yoars.
Has he put a crust of bread into the mouth
of a poor man ? Has he put a pair of pants
upon ii workingman or a petticoat upon
some blue-eyed poor gir: ?"
These questions were answered with
cries of ' 2\ol" from all parts of the house
and "He's a turncoat !"
Referring to Congressman Maguire's
lnck of usefulness as a public Bervant, Mr.
O'Brien said that there was no evidence
anyw era that Mr. Maguire had ever'se
cured one <ioliar of appropriation ior his
district. The postoffices in Sacramento
and San Jose had been erected, "but
we have the legacy of a sand
lot left full of Maguire auger
holes. They have been borinc for artesian
wells instead of giving work to the poor
mechanics of this City and State, and the
site which cost the people $1,750,000 is now
lying Idle. If lam sent to Washington I
will have the Postoffice built or 1 will
know the reason why. I will
tell the people of the Nation
that we have contributed twenty-four
and a half million of dollars during the
last four years through the Custom-hguse
at San Francisco, an we have not had 50
cents of an appropriation out of it. I
will tell you why. For the first two years
he was an industrious worker, I am told,
but during the last two years he didn't
spend two hours a day in Congress in re
turn for the $5000 a year you are paying
him.
"Where was he? He was in Delaware
making singie-tax speeches and in Mary
land endeavoring to destroy the Dem
ocratic party."
Mr. O Brien declared himself a radical
protectionist and promised that if elected
he would erect a barrier "so high that the
American eagle can't fiv over it. and that
will keep out every ounce of foreign-made
goods."
Senator Thomas C. Maher, the next
speaker, related how wages were cut
down from 4u to GO cents per day shortly
after the driving of the last spike of the
transcontinental railroad, because Of the
competition of the Eastern States with
California, made possible by the great
iron highway across the continent. This
should be tal:en as an object lesson in
protection and show the workingman the
necessity of protecting the products of
Ampiican labor from the competition of
the cheap pauper-made products of the
lower civilization of Europe.
Mr. Muher complimented James H.
Daly, ex-AssÂ°mblymun, and at present
the regular Republican nominee for Su
pervisor, and said that the Mission was
solid for him. Mr. Daly had been edu
cated in the public schools and was a
young man of known and tried integrity.
W. H. Burn ham, cand.date for the Sen
ate, also received a meaa of praise and an
enthusiastic cheer from the meeting.
On the issue of free coinage the speaker
said that the workingman would not get
any free-coinage silver unless he had an
opportunity to work ior it, and Demo
cratic free trade under the Bryan admin
istration would keep iiirn out of a job, as
it is keeping him out of a job now, by
flooding the country with cheap European
goods.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger, the
next speaker, told a funny story, which
he saddled upon Coroner Hawkins.
While the band was playing the "Red.
White and Blue" the members of the Bear
Club in their neat uniform and bearing
torches, flags and transparencies entered
the hall, throwing the crowd into great
enthusiasm. Cheer after cheer was given
for William A. Deane, candidate for Aud
itor.
Mr. Deane briefly thanked the meeting
for the cordial reception which they had
given him. .
Walter Kennison. nominee for the As
sembly from the Twenty-eighth District,
was called for, and made a brief speech,
in which be pledged himself to do all in
his power, if elected, to uphold the prin
ciples of the Republican party.
George Lee urged the election of the
municipal ticket. If Republicans were
loyal in municipal politics they would be
loyal in National matters, he said.
judge C. K. Bonesteil, candidate for the
Superior Judgeship. quoted the old adage,
"Speech is silver, silence i* polden." He
would say, however,_ that all considera
tions of his own candidacy had been swal
lowed np in his desire Tor the success of
the whole Republican ticket.
G. W. Roe of the Bear Club made an
address, in which he recommended the
election cf Edward Aiseltmuer. candi

Judge C. A. Low followed with a brief
speech, and then the mppting closed.

TALKS LOVINGLY
OF FREE SILVER
Hon. M. F. Taylor of Colo
rado Speaks at Union
Hall.
Says Mr. Bryan Would Restore
Silver Without England's
Consent.
A BRICKMASOFS HAPPY SPEECH
George Lafayette Makes a Hit With
the Audienceâ S: wall and Watson
Not Mentioned.
The Hon. M. F. Taylor, the silver
tongued advocate of free silver, who hails
from the silver-producing State of Colo
rado, addressed a Democratic meeting at
Union Hall last night. The majority of
the audience was composed of working
ruen.
It had been announced that Mr. Taylor
would answer the arguments presented by
C. A. Boutelle to a Republican audience a
few nights since. Taylor disputed the
statements and statistics offered by Bou
telle, but wii ether he refuted the argu
ments of that gentleman is a matter to be
determined by his auditors, since an
argument's success, like a jest's pros
perity, "rests in the ear oi him who hears
it; never in the tongue of Him who speaks
it."
The meeting was called to order by W.
P. Lawlor, chairman of the California
Silver Campaign Committee, who intro
duced George Lafayette, vice-president of
the Bricklayers' International Union No.
1, as cLairmpn of the evening. Mr. La
fayette made a rattling speech, showing
that he was acquainted with the temper of
his auditors and knew how to please
them. He warned laboring men to be
ware of the efforts of monopolists to con
fuse their ideas on the financial question,
hoping thereby to gain votes for Mr. Mc-
Kinley. He believed that friends of silver
ought to vote for Mr. Bryan. His idea in
regard to so many workingmen going to
Canton is that they are sent there to moke
other workingmen think that Mr. Mc-
Kinley was a sort of a human magnet,
witli special power for drawing to his per
sonality the laboring masses of the United
States.
A quartet sang two spirited campaign
ditties, alter which Mr. Taylor was pre
sented. The audience greeted him with
prolonged applause and cheering, causing
nim to remark that he was glad to see how
much in earnest the people are in regard
to the issues of the campaign.
Plunging at once into the silver ques
tion Mr. Taylor said that all the political
parties agree that silver oueht to De re
stored to "its proper piace. [Voices in the
audience "That's so."] Though all agree
that silver ought to be restored there is a
difference of opinion in regard to the way
to restore it.
The Republicans say that they would
liKe to restore silver, but they are afraid
England won't consent. However, if the
people will elect McKinley he will send
.Mark Hanna over to London to ai-k John
Bull's permission. Mr. Taylor said that
he took a different view of the situation.
He said that if they would elect Mr.
Bryan he would restore silver to its i>roper
position without the consent and in spite
of the protest of any and all foreign pow
ers and potentates.
Mr. Taylor repeated the story that Mr.
Boutelle waÃ the only meiuberof Congress
who voted against restoring to ex-Con
federate officers the right to wear the uni
form of the United States. When the
audience hissed Mr. Taylor begged them
to desist, as, (hough he was not acquainted
with the gentleman, he recognized his
right to vote as he pleaded, and knew him
to be a man of ability. It was not Mr.
Boutelle's personality to which he ob
jected, but only to the views and argu
ments urged by him in public.
Mr. Boutelle had called for the roster of
the great names of the Democratic party
and declared that most of tlie big men in
the Democratic party are now opposing
Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Taylor sadly admitted
that there was too much truth in it. It is
true they have got Mr. Cleveland, and
probably had him all the time. Mr. Whit
ney is also against Mr. Bryan, and a good
lot of such men. Then Mr. Taylor told
the good old story of the section boss
on the railroad, who was told that a straw
vote had been taken in the palace car and
that the vote was 3 to 1 in favor of the
Republicans. The reply of the section
boss would apply at this timeâ "You jnat
Wiiit till the gravel train comes and we'll
take another vote for the Democrats."
[Laughter and applause]
Mr. Taylor said that illustrates his
opinion of the present situation. The
power of money may have carried away
some of the rich who value their riches
and positions; but the active workers of
the Democratic party, the men who bear
the brunt of the battle, are still faithful to
the Democratic party and William Jen
nines Bryan. [Applause.]
When Mr. Taylor said there were two
great papers ihat had remained true to
the cause of silver, one in New York and
one in San Francisco, three cheers were
proposed and given for the Examiner,
whereupon he smilingly asked them how
they knew what paper he meant.
Mr. Taylor closed with a glowing tribute
to the workinemen of the country, who,
be said, represent the manhood and real
wealti of the Nation.
The quartet saa â .* another campaign
ballad and the meeting closed with the
usual cheers for Mr. Bryan, not a word
being said about those unfortunate twina,
Sewall and Watson.
EDDY AT THE POTRERO.
An Able Address on the Importance
of the Present Campaign
Colonel T. V. Eddy spoke to the Potrero
mechanics last night at the Opera-house
upon the issues of the campaign, under
the auspices of the Republican League.
Thomas C. Duff, an old resident of the
bluerock region, presided, and in a few
well-chosen remarks introduced the gifted
young orator, who laun died into the sub
ject without any prelude.
He said the greatest interest Is felt in
this campaign in consequence of the mag
nitude of the questions involved. Noth
ing like it has presented itself to the
American people since 1861. The credit
of the Nation, he continued, is now being
involved and this question must be ujet
and decided by the American people on
the 3d of next November. Orators on
both sides of the question had discussed
the issue and now the people, sitting as a
jury, will be callel upon to decide which
has the best side of the case.
"The question to be decid d is simple,"

he said. "It is whether the Deople want
free silver and free tariff or protection to
American industry and a revival of pros
perity throughout the land by which the
workingman will be benefited, or the
free coinage of the world's silver by which
the silver-mine owners only will be made
rich."
The depressed condition of the country
was discussed by the speaker, and the
picture of a nation issuing $262,000,000
worth of bonds to keep the Government
running in a time of peace was severely
commented upon.
The speaker appealed to his hearers to
send a Republican froiu the Fourth Dis
trict to Congress who could be depended
upon to enact laws in harmony with the
policy of Che next Republican President.
ALL FOR McKINLEY.
Morton Says tbe Colored People Want
Sound Money and a Chance
to Earn It.
T. B. Morton, president of the Afro-
American League, i 3 in receipt daily of
encouraging reports from every section of
the State concerning the strength and
popularity of JlcKinley and Hobart
among the colored people.
Some weeks ago A. L. Barnett, man
ager of the Afro-American Bureau at Chi
cago, appointed President Morton execu
tive committeeman and Rev. E. T. Cott
man advisory committeeman for Cali
fornia, requesting also that the State be
divided into five working districts, Mr.
Morton to name the district committee
men. This was immediately done, the
loliowing gentlemen being named for the
positions: T. J. Jean and Marshal Drive,
Pasadena; C. C. Flint, Los Angeleu; J.
Carter, Rivfrside; George T. Brown,
Marysville; Dudley Sebree, Banta; E. T.
Hubbard, San Francisco; J. M. Bridges,
Fresno.
"The Afro- American League," said Mr.
Morton yesterday, "numbers over 8000
voters in California, add I do not think I
am assuming too much when I say that
they are, to a man, for McKinley and Ho
bart. They want sound money and a
chance to earn it. The district commit
teemen write most encouragingly; so
much so, in fact, that any tear I might have
entertained six weeks ago of Bryan car
rying this State has entirely disappeared.
i have canvassed the field here pretty
thoroughly, both among my own people
and the whites, and am confident that
McKinley will carry the City by an over
whelming majority, in spite of the claims
set up by the calamity howlers."

BREAKING UP THE
OLD BARK DOLLAR!
Historic Craft in the Grave
yard at Belvidere
Point.
Once She Proudly Sailed Around
Cape Horn in the Clipper
Fleet.
1 HEN BECAME A COASTER.
Ne_t She Was Used for a Great Many
Years in (he Humble Cecity
of an Ark.
A historic bark is now in her grave at
Belvidere Point. The oUi-time clipper
Dollar is being broken up for the lumber i
and copper that remains in her hull, and
many a member of the colonies at Belvi- j
dereand Tiburon, who oft?n spent a jolly j
afternoon aboard the old hulk, are seeking
for mementoes of their visits.
After serving her apprenticeship in the j
Cape Horn trade the stout little vessel was
brought here and turned into a coaster.
After many vicissitudes she finally be
came the property of "Nick" Bichard,
and when lie had got all the trading pos- j
sible out of her *he was anchored off Tibu- i
ion and turned into an "anc."
For years people Irom the City rented
ncr, and her cabin was turned into a reg
ular summer home. There was consider
able ballast in the old hull, and it grad- j
ually sank into the mud until she was |
down eight feet. Then the water began i
to get in throueh the seams, and finally it
came about that no one would lease her.
It was then that Captain Murry and
his wife came along and purchased the i
old relic from iJichard. For weeks they |
iigurea on the question of moving her, i
and night and day the couple worked on
the question of getting her afloat. They
stopped the leaks and then began pump
ing, but still the Dollar would not rise.
Then they got the bnllaÂ«t out and secured
extra pumps. This time they succeeded,
and the hulk arose from her bed of mud. I
The next question was one of getting I
the vessel onto a sandy bottom. Captain j
Murry and his wife were not dismayed, |
however. A couple of nights ago, when
the moon was near its full, the old skipper
took a kedge in a small boat and dropped
It near Beiyidere Point. Then througti j
the entire night, with the "silent moon" j
as tne only witness, the old man and his
wife worked at the windlass, and next
morning the Dollar was lying on her side
on a sandy bottom.
Atter resting from their labors Captain !
Murry and his wile built themselves a
shanty on the beach and now tliey are
dismantling the old clipper at their
leisure.
Captain Murry bought the Dollar for a i
song ami experts say he will clear at
least $1000 on his venture. She is 120 feet
long anil has two sheathings of copper on
her up to the 14-foot m:irk. She is also |
copper-riveted, and the oak timbers in her |
are almost as good as when she was
launched. Every one of them has been
bttipoken, and while many of them will
go into the winter lires of the residents of
iielvidere ana Tiburon the others will be
worked into souvenir canes lor presenta
tion to those who remember the old craft
in her palmy days.
The Dollar is now almost dismantled, i
Her masts are gone and iho hatchways
have been removed. She is prominent as
a relic of the old days, whereas Relvidere
looms up as the young and prosperous
suburb of the Queen City of the Pacific.

NEW POSTOFFICE.
Speculation in Federal Circles as to
When Actual Work Will
Begin.
There is considerable ppecnlation in
Federal circles as to when actual work
will begin on the new Postollice building.
Some months ago the tenants were no
tified to move out within thirty days, as it
was desired to begin work on the struc
ture at once.
Since tnen nothine has been done on
the premise?, and no one seems to know
when tne actual construction will com
mence. Assistant Postmaster Doyle said
yesterday that the delay was due to a lack
of funds, tliough. it had been Generally
snpnospd that tliere was a suilicient fund
(.1200,000) on hand to build the foundation.
"This fund, I understand," said Mr.
Doyle, "has since dwindled to $30, C00 or
less. As a matter of fact there is no
money in the treasury with wliich to do
anytning. According to my opinion there
is no probability of work commencing on
the building for many months yet to
come."
Collector Wise, as custodian of public
buildings in San Francisco, is as much at
sea as any one. He can give no definite
idea as to when the work of construction
will begin.
ILLEGAL OPIUM TRADE
A Womaa Induced to Enter ths
Business by a Ma'e
Friend.
As No Profits Were Declared She Has
Hsd Him Arrested lor Grand
Larceny.
. A curious case was partly benra by
Jndge Caxripbell -yesterday morning. F.
L. Keyes, a young married man, was ac
cused by Margaret Stasal, 100 McAllister
street, with grand larceny.
According to the, woman's story in
court she made â¢Keyea' acquaintance last
July through his wife, and he unfolded a
scheme to her thereby both would make
money by selling opium. He told her he
had several friends on steamers plying
between this City and northern ports, who
would bring down the opium and deliver
it to him while the vessel was being un
loaded at the Oakland coal wnarf. If she
supplied the capital he would do the rest.
She became enamored of â¢ the scheme
after Keyes had taken her to a barn at
West Berkeley and shown Jots of cms of
opium, which subsequently proved to
have been filled with molasses, and she
advanced him $00. Thereafter she gave
him other sums till the total had reached
$400, but she received no returns, and her
suspicions were aroused about a month
aeo by the discovery that Keyes had been
replenishing his-ward robe withtier money.
She taxed him with it, and demanded
that Keyes should give her something
deiinite in the way of security. Keyes
ajrreed to do so, and a few days later Keyes
presented to hera written contract, where-
Dy she agreed to furnish the money re
quired to carry on the contraband opium
trade and assume all risic of loss, and
Keyes bound himself to manage the busi
ness, see to the removal of rhe opium from
the vessels and sell the same and divide
the proiits. tihe sigued the contract, being
actuated by a desire to get her money back.
The defense admitted that the $400 was
given by the woman to Keyes, but con
tended that an illegal contract could not |
be made the foundation for a criminal I
prosecution.
The Judge did not seem inclined to view
the matter in that light and continued the
case till to-day.
Greenwald's Case Again.
f The application of - Louis; Grecntvald for a |
writ of habeas corpus looking toward his re- |
lease from San Qneniin, where he is now serv- i
ing a term of six i ears for opium smuggling
was yesterday argued by his attorneys, Cran
dall.and; Bull, 'before: United-States .Circuit
Judge Koss. Nothing that ha* not already
been published developed' in the ; argument. 8

ALTERATIONS IN HER BOILERS
A Wild-G ose Chase Aftsr a Bg
Shipment of Op urn by the
San Bias.
To the snrprisa of everybody on the
water front the steamer Monowai got in
from Sydney via Auckland, Apia and
Honolulu yesterday. The .good shiD has
made twenty-four trips to this port, and
only on eight occasions has she rilled the
demands of her contract by arriving on
schedule time. On this occasion she has
done remarkably well by arriving four
hours and a half ahead of time. I
"We had a very heavy north-northeast
gale acainst us for the Jast forty-eight
hours," said Captain Carey yesterday,
"but nevertheless we made excellent time.
They have ?ome new appliances in the
machinery, and in consequence we have
averaged half a knot an hour better time
all the way acros?."
"Whll* we were in San Francisco the
Monowai Fas fitted with new liiters,"
said Chief Engineer McCaig. "These
were to catch all the oil that floated on
the water anJ til the fine dirt that would
get into the boilers. They were a great
success.
"When the ship got to Sydney they
fitted her out with 'retarders.' These are
screws about one-sixteenth of an inch
thick, which are fitted into each boiler
tube. They 'retard' the flame as it rushes
through the boiler tubes, and conse
quently the extra heat and the saving of
luel was considerable. During the entire
run the steam in the gauge never varied n
pound, 'and the saving in coal was 250
pounds an hour. Why, ray firemen insist
that they are in a new ship, and say that
for twenty-live days they never iÂ«ad 10
prick a fire. Only vessels with an extra
good natural draft and those that have a
lorced draft can use the retards, but,
thank eoodness, the Monowai has a splen
did natural draft, ;md you see the rrsult
in our getting here ahead of time. With
our new listers and new retarders combined
we are ab.e to hold our "wn with any
steamer that comes to San Francisco."

pounds of opium had been smuggled
ashore irom the steamer ban IS. us, and
that it was secreted in a house on Harriet
street. Head Inspector Holmes and a

secure the drug.. Next the information
was given that the opium was In a restau

It is calculated that the train will arrive
at its destination in the heart of the valley
at noon, after a run of about thirty miles
a:i hour.
The people of Stockton are showing a
decided interest In the excursion and
promise to fill the special train. They will
make it a demonstration of their enthu
siasm in the Valley load, which has al
ready added to the prosperity of their city
and released them from the bur Jen of
monopoly freight rates.
The Business Men's Club of Fresno w:ll
meet the train and give the visitors a fit
ting welcome.
A special train will leave Fresno Sunday
night for the accommodation of Stockton
ites, but tickets for this trip will be good
until Wednesday night. Sun Franciscans
cannot return Sunday night, but can come
home Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday
evening. The trains returning will arrive
in Stockton at an early hour, so that there
will be time for excursionists to look
around Stockton before taking the boat
lor home. Boats leave there daily at 4
and Ga. m. for this City a:ul arrive here
the following morning. The fare for the
round trip ticket is $J? 50, which is low in
comparison with the Southern Pacific rate
of $11 80 between this City and Fresno.

HUMPHREY'S WAYS
He Is Said to Show No

Charges Which Inspector-Gen"
era! Burlon Is Now la
vestigating.
OPINIONS OF AlMf MEN.
Co onei Lee, the Depot Quartermaster,
Is Said to B." Hostile to the
Engineer.
Colonel G. H. Burton, U. S. A., inspector-
Renei-al of the Pacific district, has been
directed by the authorities at Washington
to investigate certain charges preferred
against J. H. Humphrey, a civilian and
in engineer employed in the office of
I Colonei A. S. Kimball, chief quarter
master of the Department of California.
Mr. Humphrey is known as an inspector
of work and material who compels every
contractor for Government work to live
up to the strictest requirements of con
tract specifications.
Some time ago anonymous circular let
ters were sent to many contractors in San
Francisco, among them several who had
worked for the Government and whose
: work was inspected by Engineer Hum
phrey. Tne circular requested the con
tractors to call at a certain place. Quite a
number called at the place appointed.
Then they were informed that charges
were to be preferred egainst Humphrey
and they were asked if they had anything
to add.
It is the gossip in army circles that one
officer of high rank is hostile to the en
gineer and has assisted in procuring the
investigation. At the Presidio it is said
that this cflicer is Colonel Lee, the depot
quartermaster; but at department head
quarters nothing can be obtained to verity
tnis statement.
Colonel Kimbnll says distinctly that
j there are no charges of dishonesty against
| Engineer Humphrey. On that point he
lis positive. He declares that tho en
. firineer's integrity is beyond all question.
I Colonel Ludington and Colonel Chandler,
i who were predecessors of Colonel Kimball
i as chief quartermaster, each gave a letter
i t^stifyinq; in the highest, manner to the
engineer's integrity anti ability.- General
liatchelder, when quartermaster-general,
officially acknowledged the worth and
I capability of the engineer. It is claimed
t hat Colonel Burton's investigation will
bring these facta to iischtandshowth.it
the c-iiarces were instigated mainly by
contractors who were forced to respect
I specifications in regard to work done and
I material supplied.
It is acknowledged that Humphrey is
not the most suave and genial of men in
dealing with delinquent contractor;.
I When he finds material .defective in
; weight or measurement he does not say to
| the contractor, "Please remove this and
substitute other material." He is more
apt to say, "Take it off the reservation
and put in what your contract requires."
During his fifteen years of service as*in
j spector of work and material for ths Gov
ernment he has made hosts of enemies.
; His experience has taught him that there
| is nothing to bo gained by listening to
j any excuses for variation from the specili-
I oauons. He is charged by the contractors
| with uttering language of an abusive char
i ac^er and exercising a spirit of domination
that is tyrannical.
At the Presidio Club and at department
headqtiarthrs yesterday the inquiry was
I the topic of discussion. It seemed to be
the sentiment that the kick of the con
tractors would make the engineer stronger
than ever, although it was mentioned that
I Humphrey was inclined to exercise more
autnority than his position warranted,
and often exercised it in a manner that
was decidedly unpleasant.
At the present time Engineer Hum
phrey is inspecting the work at the wells,
pumping p!uht and tunnel, the construc
tion of barracks, the building of the stable
and the extensive grading at the Presidio.
Colonel Kimball asserts that the contrac
tors performing this work speak well for
the engineer.
The inspector-general will make a thor
ough investigation in accordance with in
structions from Washington, and the
chief quartermaster is confident that the
engineer will b> vindicated.
WORLD'S FAIR STAMP
The . "Corner" Â Engineered - by Albert
Hilton of New York Is at Last
Broken.,. --
' Local stamp dealers are exceedingly
happy over the news just received from
the East to the effect that the "corner" on
Columbian stamps has at last been bro
ken. For nearly eighteen months past it
has been ; practically impossible for indi
vidual small 7 buyers to secure at anything
like reasonable figures specimens of the
World's Fair edition. This has been par
ticularly true of the higher denomina
tions.
Some six weeks ago, however, there was
a decided change in the market. People
would not buy at the fancy prices asked,
fo the lesser dealers began disposing of
their stock for almost anything they could
get.' The combine was not. in a position
to make further purchases,, and they in
turn 'began to unload as rapidly as possi
ble,with the result that every, one directly
interested sought to get the better of his
neighbor.
One Chicago house was so eager to save
itself that -it sold 500 %'l stamps at
a discount of. 15 per cent. ; Local dealers
are now selling hundreds of , Columbian
stamps, demanding only a fair profit.
While the ' stamp-collectors here have
never been in the combine they have
nevertheless kept their figures well up to
the prices settiy the trust* :.' '-â¢';'; â :'-'â '
It is said that one of the principal causes
leading up to thÂ« failure of Hilton, Hughes
& Co. in New Yoric a. few days uco was
the fact that the : head partner, Albert
Hilton, devoted most of his time to the
collection of stamps. ?Hi lion was one of
those who attempted to secure a "corner"
on the Columbian . stamps â  and it is now
estimated that %he ? dropped no less than
?25,0QD when the trust went under. A set
of these stumps was at one time quoted at
$â '!, $â ) anâ¬ at times as high as $10 beyond
their face value. Now a complete set can
be purchased at a moderate premium of
$1, while certain of the higher denomina
tions are selling for less than their face
value. , _.' ' y '

FAIR'S DAUGHTERS
MUST SPEAK OUT
Dr. Marc Levingston Wants
Their Position De
fined.
Cannot Be on Both Sides of the
Case at One and the
Same Time.
DOUBLE DEALING CHARGED.
Notice of a Motion to Strike Oat
Their Answer to the Opposi*
tion Filed.
Notice was yesterday filed by Del mas &
Shortridge, attorneys for Marc Leving
ston, petitioner for the probate of the
pencil will of James G. Fair, that on Octo
ber 30 they will ask the court to strike out
the answer filed by Virginia Fair and
Theresa A. Oeirichs to the grounds of op
position of the probate of that will, pre
sented and filed by Charles L. Fair, Her
man Oeirichs Jr. and others.
The motion will be made upon the
ground that the answer of the Fair sisters
was not filed in good faith.
In his affidavit in support of the motion
Marc Levingston says that on March 18,
1895, Miss Fair, Mrs. Oelricbs and Charles
L. Fair filed a document purporting to be
the last will of ti.eir father, and to have
been wholly written, dated and signed by
him, and prayed that it might be admitted
to probate, and thereafter repeatedly and
solemnly averred that the paper was
indeed the last will of James G. Fair.
It is further alleged that the children
were most anxious to have the will ad
mitted to probate, but that since then,
for the purpose of avoiding certain obli
gations which would become incumbent
upon them on the probate of that will,
they have acted together for the purpose
of securing the probate of a prior will,
dated September 21, 1894, which docu
ment they know not to be and have
i averred not to be the last will of James G.
Fair.
To secure the end in view Charles L.
Fair is said to have withdrawn his peti
tion for the probate of the will of Septara
ber 124, and to have filed an opposition
thereto, to which opposition his sisters
appeared is defendants. Their defense,
however, has been such merely in form,
made with a view to defeating the probate
of the document.
On August 5, 189G, the sisters filed their
| answer to the opposition of Charles L.
Fair and to that of Van R. Paterson, in
which they aver that they have no in
formation or belief upon the subject of
whether or not the will of September 24
was written or signed by their father, and
! so deny that such is the fact.
This answer is declared by Dr. Leving
i ston to be in direct contradiction to the
| petition they had previously filed, wherein
i they positively declared the document to
have been wholly written, dated and
signed by James G. Fair.
Within a month past the two ladies de
clared, under oath, upon the taking of
their depositions, that thoy believed the
will to be a forgery, and Reuben H. Lloyd,
their attorney, has declared that they in
tend to contest it. Therefore, as such i 9
the intention of Miss Fair and Mrs.
Oelrichs, and as their only pleading in the
contest of Charles L. Fair is an answer in
which they deny that the will is not gen
uine, the motion will be made to strike
out that answer, it being claimed that
their attitude is calculated to defeat the
petition oi affiant by making them osten
sibly allies and enabling them in reality
to frustrate all his attempts to secure the
probate of the will by giving them practi
cal control of both sides of the contest.
It is further averred that since Virginia
Fair and Theresa A. Oeirichs no longer
desire the probate of the said will, justice
and good faith require that they take their
stand with its contestants and cease to
appear as defendants and ostensible oppo* ,
nents of ti.e contest.
It Is a Stream.
The Cordelia Chi b will probably find an in
junction suit on its hands before many days
have passed. Yesterday Assistant United
States Attorney Sam Knight was officially in
iormed that the Frank Huron Slough was a
navigable stream. This fact has been placed
before the Attorney-General and instructions
asked for. Tho Cordelia Club, it will be re
membered, secured some time ago a long lease
on the Suisun marsh, and this season placed
an obstruction across the Huron Slough. The
Sportsmen's Protective Association asked the
Government to intervene on the ground that
the slough was a navigable stream.

WITHOUT PUNTS
Seventy-Five Thousand Cir
culated From the
Schools.
Yet No Teacher Can Be Found
Who Knows of Their
Origin.
, WHAT WAS SAID AT LUNCH.
Morality of Collecting Assessments
Discussed and a Pro Charter
Meeting.
Seventy-five thousand tickets bearing
the names of twelve candidates for School
Directorships were issued yesterday by a
â¢mall coterie of lady school-teachers.
Those tweive gentlemen represent their
choice, and they, the aforesaid teachers,
will electioneer for their candidates from
now until the sun will have set on the
3d of November.
The ticket was printed in a Clay-street
establishment on a plain card just large
lerKMUll to contain the twelve names in
the same sized type as they will appear
upon the ballot. At the top are two
American flags with crossed staves just
above the words "Teachers" Ticket." The
list of names and register numbers are as
follows:
200, Barrington, Charles L.; 208, Byrne, M. ;
219, Pernam, William A.; 224, Gallagher
Â£d; 227, Hammond, Phi; 230, Head Ed;
234. Kemp, W. A.; 242, Mattner, Dr. E. H.;
â¢J.i'3, McCarthy, John J.; 254, Redmond, John
T. : 257, Shumate, Dr. Thomas E. ; "204, Waller,
BamL.
Not a teacher couid be found yesterday
to admit that he or she had the slightest
inkling as to the paternity or maternity of
that or any other one of the tickets in the
field.
At the Franklin School yesterday dur
ing the lunch hour a discussion arose
among several of the lady teachers rela
tive to the question of the expediency and
morality ot public Bchool-teachers dab
bling in politics. It was suggested that
politics was a two-edged sword which cut
both ways, and that those who handled it
might get hurt. Â«â 
It was also suggested that it was wrong
in morals and against the letter and spirit
of the purity of elections law to ask any
candidate for $10 or any other sum to de
. fray the expense of printing 75,000 or any
other number of tickets. Whereupon one
of the ladies contended that there was no
wrong either in law or morals to ask a
candidate to help defray the expense of
.printing tickets.
The statement was hotly controverted
by one or two other ladies, who remarked
" that if those who were getting up the
ticket were afflicted with so great a desire
to have their friends elected they should
â¢ themselves pay for the printing. The
ladies were too well bred to descend to
blows, but they stabbed one another with
angry elances and sharp words.
R. D. Falkner, principal of the Franklin
School, did not know anything about any
of tiie tickets save what ne had read in
The Call He had not heard that any
ticket had originated from the teachers
â¢ under his supervision.
Mrs. Parolini of the same school had
seen one or two of the tickets that had
k been issued, but was blissfully ignorant
of their authorship.
Miss Mollie L. Brown knew nothing of
any combination of teachers or of any as
sessment having been levied against the
candidates. She did not meddle with
politics, she said.
Miss Afcearn made a statement to the
same effect.
Miss Edith Crowley, principal of the
Stanford School, said that she knew noth
ing about the matter except what she had
read in The Call.
"I am positive," she added, "that there
has b?en no combination among my
teachers and that no ticket has been put
up. Tiie Stanford School is not in poli
tics."
â  C. L. Barrington, whose name heads the
list on the 75,000 tickets and whose name
appears on about all the tickets that have
been put up in the School Department
thus far, denied that he had been asked
by any one to pay an assessment;
When asked whether there was any
question of religious intolerance in the
department Mr. iSarrington replied that
during the last campaign atiokeihad been
made up dj* some of the teaciiers and
some one had complained that there were
too many Catholic names upon it, and for
that reason an opposition ticket was put
in the field. "But," added he, "there
does not seem to be anything of that kind
in this campaign.
"I know," continued Mr. Barrington,
"where those stories to the effect that 1
paid $10 to one of the teachers originated.
They emanated from a woman whose hus
band was not put on the ticket, and she is
noted for the length and agility of her
tongue."
A SMALL MEETING.
Only Seventy- Five Attended the
Call for a Pro-Charter Talk.
Only seventy-five teachers attended the
meeting in the Girls' High School yester
day afternoon for the purpose of urgiug
.c adoption of the new charter. Elisha
Brooks presided, and the following reso
lution was submitted as the basis of dis
cussion:
Bctolved, That it Is the understanding of the
teachers here assembled that the present mode
oi electing regular teachers In this depart
mentâi. c., without special contractâ is the
result of custom wisely followed acd not liab>e
to be affected in any way by the adop lioD / of
the proposed charter; and, further, that for
teachurb so elected the good-behavior tenure
is secured by section 1793 of the Political (Joae
of California, and the interpretation thereof
by the courts ol law; that it is our certain be
lief that this tenure, resting in the general
law ot the State, is not antagonized by auy
provision of the proposed charter, and, more
over, by well-established principles of the
commonwealth, cannot be affected by any
..charier or other act of special legislation.
Eesclvtd. Juithcr, That it is the sense 01 this
assembly that the proposed chart- r, on the
'.vhole, is a great improvement over existing
' conditions of law and organization and that
its adoption wiil mark, an epoch in the politi
cal advancement of San Francisco, and its re
jection will be proof of aputby und lack of
public .spirit; that it is the part of good citi
zens in the present emergency to sink their
personal prejudices in the larger considera
tion of the City's good, and that it is our belief
that ali who cun come to this point of view
will be fouud granting to the proposed re
organization their hearty support.
Albert Lyser made fix argument in favor
of the educational provisions of the char
ter and recommended that the teachers
form a pro-charter committee and or
fcaii:za for the purpose of electioneering
lor it.
Professor Clark, teacher of history in the
High School, said that the charter matter
had been before the people for a year past,
ali'd it was too late now to organize.
1 Principal A. L. Mann ol the Denman
â¢tiiool ,a:d that he diii not btlieve (hat
t%t meetine was fairly representative of
tire pro-charter sentiment of the School
Department. The teachers were doing
very well under the present system, and
he did not see how the conditions would
be bettered by the new charter. The ob
jections which had been made to the edu
cational provisions of the charter had not
been explained, and he hoped that ifaey
would be explained in the near future.
Mr. Clement had promised to do so, but
he had not kept his promise. He would
doubtless do so very soon. The speaker
had not seen or heard any reply to one of
the objections raised by Mr. Reddy to the
charter, but he hoped that a reply would
be soon forthcoming.
Elisha Brooks remarked that the bad
points of the charter had been pointed
out, but that the good points, and they
were many, had not been mentioned. He
would liKe to have that aspect of the char
ter illuminated.
"If we defeat this charter," he added,
"the opinion will gain ground that the
maximum fund is too much, and that will
be bad. Another point in its favor is the
segregation of the salary lund. We are
liable to make ur> in a very short time
those deficipnces."
Professor Mann announced that he had
something new to say on the subject. The
teachers believe that the tenure of office is
weakened by the section which says that
no teacher shall be dismissed except for
sufficient cause, which cause shall be de
termined by the Board of Education after
such teacher shall have had a bearing in
his or her defense. He understood that
the sufficiency of the ciuse would be de
termined after the hearing of the case
by the general laws of the State.
Silas A. White opposed the reference of
the matter to a committee.
"Why should you delegate your power
to some secret star chamber proceeding?"
he asked. "The freeholders did not treat
the teachers of this City with that degree of
circumspection and propriety that would
allow us to give to their successors, the
Charter Association, any kind of pur
chase. Let us vote upon the resolution
here and adopt it or reject it."
Mr. Lyser did not think that the resolu
tions were sufficiently specific.
Mr. Mann read the following letter from
R. H. Webster, candidate for School
Superintendent:
"Imperative engagements detain me
from the meeting of teachers called by
yourself and seven other fellow-teachers.
This I much regret, for I am in sympathy
with your purpose."
A motion being adopted recommending
the appointment by the chair of a com
mittee of five to prepare an address to be
delivered to the teachers, Mr. White arose
and in a north pole accent remarked that
he would be very much pleased if some
body would show the propriety and ele
gance of selecting a deputy superinten
dent by the Board of Education and thus
come into conflict with the Superinten
dent.
"Mr. Chairman," he added, "1 wish yon
would place some lady on the committee,
because I am opposed to the charter â
that's square toed."
Miss Hodgkinson of the Girls' High
School and several others said that they
were opposed to the charter.
C. W. Moore, vice- principal of the Lin
coln Grammar School announced that he
was against the charter.
James Denman made a speech favoring
the charter, in which he said that every
boodler in the City Hail was opposed to
the charter, and that was one of the
reasons why he favored it.
The iesolutions were referred to the fol
lowing committee and the meeting ad
journed : R. D. Faulkner, James Denman,
Elisha Brooks, W. W. Eush. A. L. Mann,
Mrs. L. K. Burke, Miss Ni A. Wood and
Albert Lyser.
FROM McKIILEY'S STATE
Enthusiastic Meeting of the
Ohio Republican
Club.
Addresses by Colonel John P. Jackson,
Ben B. Haskell and Thomas
O'Brien.
The Ohioan, when transplanted into the
outdoor climate of California, improves if
anything upon the same gingerly article
remaining upon its indigenous heath.
The second open meeting of the Ohio Re
publican Club at the Auditorium last
evening, by way of a case in point.
Colonel John P. Jackson presided, and
as a "mite to the general quota," he said
he had just returned from a tour through
the southern end of the State, and had
found the spirit of Republicanism every
where spreading and growing enthusiastic.
He described the enthusiastic receptions
tendered to Benjamin Butterworth.
Speaking to the audience as Oiiioans, he
ran over a list of the great names, their
fellow-native sons â soldiers, statesmen
and jurists â of which they had a right to
be prouo. Among the list of Presidents
hailing from Ohio he placed the name of
McKinley, and the audience heartily con
curred with him.
The meeting was called to complete the
organization of the club, but it was bent
on its own entertainment and had pro
vided an excellent programme to that
end, including Sam Booth and the Cali
fornia Quartet and Miss Ella Ellis in vocal
selections.
"I believe now, two weeks before the
election, that the principle of woman suf
frage is already an accomplished fact in
this State, and therefore our right in ad
dressing you all, ladies and gentiemen, as
fellow-citizens and Republicans," said
Ben B. Haskell, who was intro
duced as a young Republican. Mr.
Haskell entertained his audience by
a series of goo-l stories illustrating as
many good points. He advised every man
who believed that Mexico and China were
good countries for this great Nation to
emulate to vote the Democratic ticket
He ran through the familiar story of sil
ver legislation, and he drew two pictures
of the result of the election â the disaster
that will follow Bryan's success, the cheer
ful picture of prosperity that is sure to
coma with McKinley's election.
Thomas B. O'Brien, candidate for Con
gress from the Fourth District, was then
introduced.
Mr. O'Brien made a short but telling
speech, laying stress upon the desertion of
the Democratic leaders from the red flaÂ«
of Bryan and the stampede of all thought
ful Democrats off the unsafe platform.
He spoke of the pledge of the Republican
party to build the Nicaragua canal and of
the great benefit that it would be to this
coast.
In adjourning the audience gave three
rousing cheers for McKinley and three
more for O'Brien.
The Elder Club.
The George W. Elder Central Club, com
posed of a membership of 800 from all the
Assembly districts of this City, held its
weekly meeting Wednesday evening at
Western Hall, Shiels building, 32 O'Far
rell street, about 500 being present.
The large number pretent were enthusi
astic in their support of the candidacy of
Mr. Elder.
The reports of the various committees
from each district, heretofore appointed,
were of a most cheering character. Re
ports were made by T. H. McCarthy, Dave
Short, James Gillefan, Dawson Mayer, P.
J. Walsh, George A. Bates, Jame3 McNair,
Georce M. Pennie, Harry .Lewis, ex-Sher
iff Thomas Desmond, John F. Hannon
(reprÂ«senting the Foisom-street Improve
ment Club) and numerous others.
Tae enthusiasm manife-ted at these
weekly reunions of the friends of Mr.
Elder point strongly to his election to the
position of Superintendent of Street*.
The meeting adjourned with three rous
ing cheers Jor George W. Elder and the
members marched in a body to attend the
meeting at tlie Auditorium.
For Cord H. Wetjen.
A large cumber of enthusiastic Republicans
met in one of the courtrooms of the City Hall
last evening in the interests of Cord H. Wet
jen. M. Stevens was elected chairman and S.
H. Brown secretary. Members of the club
were instructed to report at the next meeting
one name from each precinct of their respec
tive <iistricts who will labor In the interests of
Mr. Weijeo tor Tax Collector.

For the office of grand patron the names
of John Gallup and James Tapscott were
placed in nomination and the balloting
resulted in the election of the latter. The
new grand patron is a resident of Yreka,
Cal.
John Gallup was elected associate grand
patron.

re-elected grand secretary, and Mrs. laador
Horton, also of San Francisco, was re
chosen grand treasurer.
The rest of the officers, which are
appointed by the grand matron, will be
named at to-day's session.
Sixteen new chapters were given
charters, and one which had failed to
present its papers in proper shape was
eiven a year's dispensation.
A motion by the committee on jurisdic
tion to change the name of Oakland Chap
ter O. E. S. so it would not conflict with
the name of a Masonic lodee in that city
was voted down, much to the joy of that
ohapter.
The conventionwill close its session to
day after choosing the place of the meet
ing next year, which will be San Fran
cisco.
In the evening the Grand Chapter met
in the Masonic Temple, where Golden
Gate Chapter No. 1 gave an exemplifica
tion of the work. The hall was crowded,
about 1000 people being present. Among
those present were all the representatives
to the Grand Chapter from both this City
and the State at large.
After the exemplification of the work,
which evoked warm expressions of appre
ciation from the visiting delegates, a line
of march was formed to the spacious ban
quet hall, where a bounteous least awaited
the guests.
Mrs. Fannie McCowen, the grand mar
shal, led the line, followed in turn by
Grand Patron- J. B. Merritt of Oakland,
Mrs. Carrie Peaslev of Los Angeles, grand
matron; Dr. G. W. Day wait, patron of
Golden Gate Lodge; Mrs. Duren, the ma
tron; then the rest of the grand officers,
then the grand officers-elect, the past
grand officers, and finally by the visiting
members.
The tables were heavily laden with good
thincs. Flowers were tastefully arranged
round the hall and at each plate was a
boutonniere.
Toasts were given and speeches made
and everybody departed at last from what
was unanimously termed the most suc
cessful affair of the kind ever held in this
City.
SPOKE FOR PROTECTION,
A Rousing Republican Meeting
He'd on Union-Street
Hill.
Henry C Dibble, Hon. Thomas B.
Shannon, Carroll Cjok and A. B.
Treadwell the Speakers.
There was a grand Republican rally in
the Forty-first Assembly District last
evening, and Terrys Hall on Hyde and
Filbert streets was filled to the doors.
Long before the Republicans of the dis
trict assembled the place of meeting was
shown by a huge bonfire that illuminated
the whole of Union-street hill.
The Hon. Thomas B. Shannon presided
and the old warhorse was received with
cheers.
The Hon. Henry C. Dibble, the princi
pal speaker of the evening, was received
with cheers, in his opening remarks he
paid a pleasant compliment to the chair
man of the evening, who was a member of
Congress from California in 1860, and who
stood a stanch friend to President Lincoln
and to the Union in the times of trouble
that followed, lading up the line of
questions of the hour Mr. Dibble said that
up to a few months ago the only issue
in National political circles was protection,
but the Democrats, seeing the eyes of the
people turned toward Mr. McKinley, took
up the silver question so as to divert the
public's attention irom the real issue. The
whole East is for protection, and he hoped
that the banner State of the West will
stand for McKinley and sound money.
Taking up more local subjects Mr. Dibble
said:
"The only way to secure a Republican
Senate is to elect legislators who will ful
fill your wishes. I have two opponents in
this district. I hope that both are popular
so as to divide the votes on the other
side that I may be successful. I question
the loyalty of Ben Fehneman a3 a Repub
lican in running against the regular nomi
nee of the party. Now I hope that old
Union-street hill will stand by me.
[Cheers and shouts "We will."] I will
stand by the choice of the Republican
party for United States Senator."
FORSAKING WETMORE.
Elder Says the Wheeluieu Are All
Coming His Way.
George Elder, regular Republican nomi
nee for Superintendent of Streets, was in
a very jubilant frame of mind last nieht.
"I was visited at my office, 906 Market
street, this afternoon," he said, "by a
deputation from the wheelmen, who in
formed me that they intended to form an
Elder club immediately. They were very
emphatic in their statements, and said
thay had concluded to take this action on
account of the use George W. Wetmore,
the nominee of the Citizens' Non-Partisan
and the Citizens' Independent party, has
been making of their name.
"Wetmore, they asserted, has declared
in the hearing of several persons that he
has a 'cinch' on tneir votes and can con
trol them as he pleases. They intend to
demonstrate that he cannot.
"Furthermore, I was informed that they
had issued orders for banuers for 300
wheels, with my name on them, to be
used in future parades. This is very
cheering news to me, I can assure you."
NOW IT IS SHAKESPEARE.
The Tabers Give a Finished
Performance of "As You ,
Like It."
Rosalind Is Ideal y Portrayed â Mr.
Taber's Clever Young
Orlando,
There was a difference in the atmos
phere of the Baldwin Theater last night,
for "Romola" was withdrawn and
Shakespeare was the order of the night.
"As You Like It" was the play, and a
highly artistic performance the TaDers
gave of it. In the whole range of
Shakespeare's heroines there is scarcely a
more difficult character to properly pre
sent than Rosalind. The absolute pur
ity and 1 licacy of the character
are apt to degenerate into carelessness,
or to become perverted into hoydenish
ness in the hands of an artist who has not
a touch of genius. Julia Marlowe Taber
has the necessary qualification for an
ideal Rosalind. As an eye picture she
was delightful in her russet doublet and
hose and her pomegranate cloak, but what
was more important her characterization
left, little if anything to be desired. She
seized the mischief and daring of Rosa
lind without losing sight of her womanly
tenderness and romance, and in her scenes
with Orlando there was an innocent girl
ishness and abandon which called forth
hearty applause.
Robert Taber was a fine, manly young
Orlando; Eugenia Woodward was very
good as Celia; G. W. Anson made an ex
cellent Touchstone and the rest of the cast
was satisfactory.
â¢'As You Like It" was staged in a most
arti.uic manner.
PARADE AT SAN JOSE.
The National Bepublican League of
Thin City Will Take Part.
The National Republican League of this
City held a meeting in the PioneeT build
ing last evening and decided to take part
in the grand parade to be held in San
Jose on the evening of the 24th inst.
The league will be escorted by the
Piumed Knights drill corps, and each
member will carry a combination um
brella flambeau. The umbrella torch or
flambeau is a decided novehy and is
gorgeously picturesque. The umbrella is
made of silk and contains pictures of Mc-
Kinley and Hobart.
On the top of the umbrella the flambeau
is attached, and as it blazes up the silken
picture", surrounded by the National
colors, stand out in bold relief. Several
thousands of the novel illuminators have
been procured, and all who want one will
be supplied.
The league has issued an invitation to
all Republicans who would like to make
the trip to San Jose, to call at the Pioneer
building, either to-day or Saturday, not
later than 5:30 p. m., and receive umbrella
torch and join the parade.
German Republicans.
The German-American Republican Club
will meet to-night at 413 Bush street.
Among the speakers will be E. S. Salo
mon, Hon. Thomas B. O'Brien and George
\V. Elder. The committee has also ar
ranged for a fine musical programme*
HISSES REIGN
AT THE TEMPLE
A Stormy Audience Hears
a Debate on the
Charter.
A. P. Van Duzer Fights Hard
for a Chance to Make
a Speech.
PROS AND CONS PRESENTED
Two Speeches For and Two Against
the New Organic Law for
the City.
One of the noisiest, most irrepressible,
ill-bred and unfair audiences ever assem
bled in San Francisco gathered at Metro
politan Hall last night to hear a debate
on the merits and demerits of the new
charter.
Some of the speakers were hissed down,
all were interrupted oy questions, cat
calls and boisterous laughter, and hun
dreds of lovers of fair play, after waiting
beyond endurance for order, departed in
disgust. During the entire proceedings
Cbairman Will 8. Green, with a feeble
voice and timid manner, was wholly un
able to restore order, his weak voice fail
ing to be heard more than twenty feet
from the platform. He finally gasped
that the conduct of hundreds was dis
graceful. He threatened to call the police
and to adjourn the meeting, but the
storms of hisses continued, as if a den of
snakes bad been disturbed by intruders.
Finally good order was restored, and the
debate, continued without further disturb
ance.
The speakers were H. N. Clement and
A. P. Van Duzer for the charter acd
Colonel O'Byrne and Editor McArthur of
the Coast Seamen's Journal against it.
Mr. Clement was the first speaker. Each
of the contestants was limited to half an
hour.
Mr. Clement began by stating that the
laws of San Francisco were in a confused
condition, depending largely on 400
Supreme Court decisions, rendered during
forty years of litigation.
"The laws are not systematic," he said,
"but are a crazy patchwork all through.
The question, however, is not whether
this charter is perfect, but whether it is
not far better than the present law."
Speaking of the advantages of the new*
charter the speaker held that: "It is an
orderly code of laws, dividing the func
tions of Supervisors, creating a board of
public works and doing other good wort.
It creates a board of public works, wipes
out ward lines, provides for acquiring
public utilities, provides for home rule
and civil service, establishes a non-parti
san government and limits taxation."
The speaker criticized many features of
the present law in detail, dwelling par
ticularly on the fact that the Governor has
too much power, and that he ought not to
be allowed to appoint so many officers as
he now does. He spoke of the civil
service section of the new charter, and
finaliy held that the new instrument
would strike a deadly blow at bossism.
Editor McArthur stepped onto the plat
form with him amid cheers. He began by
saying:
"The freeholders are blind to their own
interests, but, like all true parents, they
are dogcedly for their own kind, even for
giving their children who are inflicted
with gross defects.
"I represent the workingmen, and they
stand for the average intelligence and
honesty of the land, and we oppose this
charter. [Cheers. J This instrument has
many detects, but the most vital one is
that it cannot be nmended without the
most circuitous and inexpeditious work.
Its advocates already admit many of its
faults, which are enough to damn it. In
some things it is fair, but in most it is
very deliberately subversive of the rights
of the people. Under the new provisions
we could never change it, never get it
amended. Of course there are many
points in it that are all right, but as a
whole it is for the ricb, for corporations."
Continuing the speaker said :
"Article VIII, chapter 2, section 5, pro
vide^ that the Board of Police Commis
sioners may appoint special officers to do
'special service' on benalf of any person,
firm or corporation, the same to be paid
by the persons receiving the ser
vice. Plainly put, this is incipient
Pinkertonism. The underlyine princi
ple of that institution is 'special
privilege'; it means that the services of
the authorities are at the disposal of any
one who is able and willing to pay for
them. The well-known record of Pinker
tonism shows that institution to be a
dangerous menace 10 the peace of
any community. The men who
engage in that work are notori
ously desperate and unprincipled ; they
depend for their living upon crime, riot
and disorder, and they are as ready to
create it as to suppress it. The Pinker
tons are spies and incendlane?, and their
real significance is not the protection of
property or the detection of crime, but the
defeat of the public will by precipitating
riot. The lives and property oi all citizens
are equally entitled to the protection of
the properly constituted authorities, but
no man by reason of his wealth should be
able to purchase the special guardianship
of the law. Pinkertonism is universally
recognized as one of the mo^t execrable
institutions of modern development. It
has been specially legislated against by
many communities and should be rebuked
by the citizens of San Francisco."
"The speaker's views throughout were
heartily cheered.
Chairman Will S. Green followed in an
attempt to introduce A. P. Van Duzer, but
the audience lau.'he^, applauded and
hissed by turn, until Mr. Van Duzer had
to begin without the intended introduc
tion.
"I compliment Colonel O'Byrne, who is
to follow me," he said, "for he is an elo
quent, thoughtful and honest man.
[Hisses and cheers.] He opposes the
charter and I favor it, so we come to give
you both sides."
At this juncture the cheering was 80
great that Colonel O'Byrne arose and im
plored the audience to hear his opponent
fairly, but theyells continued, interspersed
with hisses.
"As between this charter and the pres
ent boss rule there can be no comparison,
yet ail kinds of ridiculous objections are
made to it. You hear people say that the
street railroads would have too much
power* I simply answer by re
ferring to the murder of a little
child by the railroad company
jnst the other day. Why? Because there
13 no power in this Government to compel
these railway companies to put fenders on
their cars. WbyT Because poi'tical
oosses prevent it. [Great and prolonged
hisses.] I will not be hissed down. I
have been through the war [laughter] and
this conduct on your part is a better argu
ment than I can make for the provision
for a chaingang for culprits"
The speaker then decanted on the hon
esty of the Mayors of the City. "All for
twenty-five years have been honest men,
have they not? The four men now up
are honest."
At this juncture pandemonium reigned
and to attempt to sneak was useless.
Chairman Green pleaded, begged and
threatened for order, but it did not come.
Every time Vau Duzer started to spea* he
was hissed. This lasted for some minutes,
and finally the speaker was allowed to
finish, saying:
"All I meant to say was that your
Mayors have been, as they probably will
be, honest men. Let them govern. Let
men of all shades of wealth help
to make the municipal au
thorities more independent. They
say the charter cannot be amended.
Whose fa-ult is this? The error of the
little man who sits yonder [Denis
Kearney], and who worked for the new
Constitution, is the error they complain of
now, for it is a constitutional provision.
[Kearney â "I am opposed to the new
charter."] No, you wiil tiud 'the push' is
against the charter, and that is true. The
Spriner Valley does not want it, nor does
the Sout crn Pacific."
Denis Kearney here arose and asked
whether Mr. Van Duzer had not made a
speech against the chart r for the Portia
Law Club. The speaker denied that he
had made such a speech.
Colonel O'Byrne^ concluded the even
ing's argument, talking against the new
charter.
He said: "One of the things history
loudly tells us is that free communities
are disorderly, but if you will listen I will
say that this new charter ha 3 not been
formed philosophically and in the light of
political history."
The speaker then dwelt at some length
on the undue power given the Mayor, and
announced himself as opposed to "the
modern fad of civil service, with its
shabby genteel aristocracy."
He said that he believed if the new
charter should be adopted thieves and
vagabonds would prowl about the City
Hall, coveting poor men's property, the
Mayor would be a czar and liberty would
be a dead thing. '
"I oppose the unchanging salary sys
tem," he said, "for if butter goes to $1 a
pound a clerk's wages ought to be raised. I
oppose the idea of giving ihe Mayor power
to discharge people in every department,
and the whole thing is unjust, ridiculous
and badly arranged."
WESTPHAL A POLICEMAN
Appointed Veterinary Surgeon
for the Depart
ment
He Was Sworn In Yesterday in Due
Form by Chief of Police
Crowley.
At the meeting of the Police Commis
sioners Wednesday night, Christian H.
Westphal, veterinary surgeon, was ap
pointed a member of the police force, his
particular duty being to attend to the
horses connected with the department.
The appointment had been under con
sideration for several weeks. It was first
intended that it should rest with the
Board of Supervisors, and a salary of $40 a
month was attached to the position. This
was from the fact tnat the horses us^d in
the patrol wagons were the property of the
Board of Supervisors and the expenses of
their maintenance were borne by that
board.
Westphal had been slated for the ap
pointment, but owing to the small salary
attached to the position his friends got to
work and it was decided by the Supervi
sors that the patrol- wagon horses should
in future be under the entire control of
the Police Department. Then it was urged
that as there were a number of horses used
by the mounted policemen there was
enough work for a veterinary surireon to
entitle him to a salary of $100 a month, the
same as Dr. Keeney is drawing as phys
ician for the department.
The result was that the Board of Super
visors two or three week 3 ago passed an
ordinance that the police force should
consist of 531 men instead of 550 and that
one of the number should be veterinary
Burgeon for the department.
This action of the board paved the way
for the appointment of Dr. Westphal.
Almost immediately after the passing of
the ordinance Dr. Westphal signed his
application for a position on the police
force and it was laid before the Board of
Police Commissioners.
It was expected that the appointment
would be made at the meeting a week ago
last Wednesday, but for some reason or
other it was delayed for another week.
Dr. Westphal was sworn in by Chief
Crowley yesterday, and was provided with
his star of office. He received tne con
gratulations of his friends with becoming
modesty.
There are, including the patrol wagon
horses, about fifty Horses altogether to
look after and the duties of the office will
not be very exacting.
The department 13 now well equipped in
every shape and form, It has a physician
to look after the sick men and a veterin
ary surgeon to look after the sick horses.

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top fignrea
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted sr.ow in inches and hundredths,
during the past twelve hours. Jsobars, or solid
lines, connect polri s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiifh" means high barometric pressure and
is nasally accompanied by fair weather; "low"
r<f>>rs to low presaore. and is usually preceded
and accompanied by clondy weatherand rains.
"Lows" 11s: ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the prefsure is high In the Interior
and low along the coast, aad the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in ;he vicinity of Idaho, ami

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, In.. Oct. 2?.â Wheat continued its
decline this morning. More long property ' and
â ome short pressed on the market. Liverpool was
weak ana lower and continental markets fur
nished a similar story. The cash situation has a -
sumed considerab c importance. Ti:ht money is
reported from all the , business . centers and . the
question cf carrying wheat li one that Is crowd ; ng
all others at the pi esent time. The confirmation
of India sales at Â£>an Francisco shown that' much
exaggeration took place regarding that phaie of
the situation, nearly six cargoes being worked
where at least fifteen were reported at different
times.
Everything considered, the situation was less
bullish than a week ago. The Cincinnati Price
Current reported a favoraole week for the crap.
Receipts were 238 cars at Chicago, and 123,064
bushels were taken from store. The Northwest
had 1019 cars against 1147 a year ago Closing
I iverpool cables gave a total decline of 3V*d for
the day, and continental quotations were corre-
I spondingly lower. Export clearances were 355,.,
725busbels.
i During the last half hour a panic reigned. Con-
I f mli-n â¢ was extreme, millions of bushels beini;
: poured on thÂ« mark*:. December fell from 73 3 4 c
| t0. 7014c with- lichtning speed, the excitement
i coming to an end only with the closing tap of the
be!. December wheat opened from 74V4C to
733/ B e, sold be;ween 74Â»4c and 703^4c. closing ai
70% c. 434 c tinder yesterday. .Estimated receipts
for to-mo'i row, 191 cars.
i CORNâ Yielded unresistingly to the depressing
â  influence of the weak wheat market. No startling
Incidents were enacted. Trade was large, and the
main object of operators was to dispose of what
corn was accumulated while the outlook was rosy.
Receipts were 724 cars, and b17,051 bushels wÂ«*re
taken from store. Liverpool cables were %d
lower, fcxpor; clearances amounted to 427, -79
bushels. Way cora opened at 27% c, sold between
2g@273, B e. c osing at 27% c, %c under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 700 cars. "
OATBâ With wheat ana corn â¢ declining, little
hope was entertained for oatÂ«. Holders made the
best of a baa situation and s Id on every bard spot.
Receipts were 422 cars, and 113,545 bushels were
taken from sto-e. Kxports were 10,570 bushels..

U 0 \swtÂ«uÂ»va, 'BREACH IN THE
' PASTORS' UNION
Methodists Withdraw From
the Celebration of
Luther's Day.
Dr. Wendte of the Unitarian
Church Was Given Too
Much Prominence.
EEV. E.UMMEB, SO INSTRUCTED
He and His Choir Must Take No Part
in the Proposed Union
Meeting.
Oakland Office Sax Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 22. j
The evangelical Christian churches of
this city will not all unite in the union
cervices which had been planned by the
Oakland Ministerial Union Saturday night
of next week in commemoration of
Luther's day.
The reason of this is the feeling between
evangelical and other churches.
It was supposed that the arrangements
lor the meeting had all been satisfactorily
made, but it is now announced that the
official board of the First Methodist Epis
copal Church sat on the whole affair and
have instructed the Rev. Alfred Kummer,
D.D., their pastor, and the choir that they
are to have nothing whatever to do with
the affair, owing to the prominence beine
given the Rev. Charles W. Wendte, pastor
of the Unitarian church, on the pro
gramme.
The official board of a Methodist church
consists oi the trustees, class leaders and
officers of all department. They held a
meetinc and considered the matter at con
siderable lengtn and it was finally decided
that as a church they could not take part
in a service to commemorate an -event of
buch historical importance in tbe church
when a mnn who denied the divinity of
Christ, their leader, was to be the most
prominent on the programme.
The Ministerial As-sociation was organ
ized a little over a year ago for the ex- ;
change of thought on theological ques
tions, consuituions on important issues
and questions of local interest, and, as far
as possible to reach harmonious action by
the churches. The association has in
creased in power and influence, and now
has a membership that represents every
Protestant church in the City. .Once a
month they assemble around the banquet
table and feed the body while listening to
addresses by members or invited guests.
The membership is as follows:
The Revs. J. L. Allen, John Bakewell, G. W.
Beatty, R. F. Coyle, James Curry, E E. Clark,
L. Dallgren, J. E. Edwards. John W. Ellis, J.
M. French, Philip Graif, H. L. Gregory. (... M. j
Hill, C. H. Hoburt, H. L. Hozgraie, Alfred
Jolander, A. J. Jatho, Owen Jones, G.H. Jones,
Alfred Kuromer, J. K. McL-an, F. J. Mynard,
11. B. McÃriae, C. A. Nelson, S. S. Palmer,
August Peterson, James Small, Robert Ritchie,
V. Marshall Law, O. W. Lucas, H. M. Mc-
Knieht, R. F. Steinbach, J. H. Thei<?, H.
Tychsen, E. S. Williams, Robert Whittaker.
Edward Davis, G. S. Wallace, J. M. Freeland,
E. S. Chapmen, J. O. Wahlberg, J. Brasea'eid
and George Giunz.
The officers of the association are: President, j
the Rev. R. F. Coyle; secretary, the Rev. j
Owen Jones; treasurer, the Rev. Alfred â 
Kummer.
Three months ago the R^v. J. E. Bush- I
nell, pastor of ttie English Lutheran
church, suggested a union meeting of all
the churches of the city for Sunday even
ing, November 1, at the exposition build
ing, at which time a programme should !
De presented bearing on the Reformation I
and Martin Luther. It m-t with favor, j
and the Rev Mr. Wendte, navirig a nnm- |
ber of fine stereopiicon views connected i
with that event, offered them for the occa
sion.
Immediately there was a division
amonc the members regarding the ad
visability of all trying to attend the ex
position building, and some suggested
union meetings in thÂ«- various parts of tbe
city at the same hour. Thf matter was
finally left to the executive committee
and they plac d the Rev. Mr. Wendte in
charge of the proeramme, as he had
shown so much enthusiasm. At the next
meeting the following programme was
submitted:
Music by the united choirs; scripture
lesson, the Rev. C. H. Hobart; prayer, the j
Rev. Alfred Kummer, D.D.; address, the
Rev. R. F. Coyle, D.D. ; bio?raph ; cal sketch
of Luther, the Rev. J. E. Busline!!; Lu
iher's hymn, "Em Festen Berg": offer
tory; address, the Rev. Charles R. Brown;
Btereopticon, the Rev. C. W. Wendte;
benediction.
The ministers finally decided to hold the
DR. F. L. WILKINS OF THE BAPTIST Y. P. U.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 21.â Dr. F. L. Wilkins of Chicago, general secretary of the
Baptist Young People's Union of America, is to visit Central and Northern Califor
nia, and will commence his circuit October 25 at Dixon. He will be in Oakland, at
Rev. C. H. Hobart's church, Thursday evening, October 29. His other dates are:
Sacramento, October 25 and 26; Stockton, October 27; San Jose, October 28; San Fran
cisco, October 30; Petaluma, November 1, morning; San Francisco, November 1,
eveninp; San Francisco, November 2, at ministers' meeting.
Dr. 'Wilkins is an acknowledged leader of the young people's movement in the
V churches to-day, and to whom perhaps more than any other worker can be attributed
the success which the Baptist Youne People's Union has attained. Dr. Wilkins'
â¢oming is not to meet those whose organization is a Baptist union, but to meet Bap
tists, old and young, of whatever name or organization. He will present the young
people's movement and the Christian culture courses in such a manner that those who
Jiear him cannot but be interested.
meeting on Saturday night, October 31, in
the First Congregational Church and in
viteu ali of ihe choirs to unite in furnish
ing music. The first refusals to assist
came from the East Oakland churches, as
Saturday is choir rehearsal nicht. Now
comes the greater interf rence by the
Methodists, ana it is believed that others
will follow, new that the way has been
opened.
Comity Committee Sued.
OAKLAND. Cal, Oct. 22â N. B. Vail,
leader of the Infantry band, has sued the
old Republican County Committee for
$192. The largest portion of the amount
is for music supplied to political gather
ings during the past two years. The de
fendant says the campaign committee is
the responsible party.
H Ik Inspector*' Raid.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 22.-lnspectors
Pierce and Ott made an unexpected raid
on the milkmen last evening, taking a
quantity from each as they were found
on the street. The tests made to-day
showed all to be above the 3 per cent in
butter- fat required.
THE MEETING CUT SHORT
Suffragists at Lorin Stopped in
the Middle of Their Pro
gramme.
"Skull and Keys" Society Trouble
Still PendingâBerkeley-Reli
a nee Fco bail.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 22,â There was
a sensation at trie suffrage meeting in
Lorin last night, and as a result several of
the local suffrage workers have expressed
themselves as being very much in-ulted.
It seems that the Rev. E. Lyman Hood,
who, by the way, is opposed to woman
suffrage, bad permitted several of the
leaders of the cause in Berkeley, among
whom are Mrs. George W. Haight, Mrs.
Ednor Carlisle, the Rev. J. D. Foster and
Attorney George W. Haight, to open a
meeting at the conclusion of the Wednes
day evening prayer service of the church.
It was nearly 9 o'clock before theprayer-
I meeting was over and the suffragists had
commenced their speeches. Because ot
the late hour a number of the congrega
tion got up and left. Mrs. Haight was the
first suffrage speaker. She was followed
by her husband, who whs to have been
i succeeded by the Rev. J. D. Foster, the
1 speaker of the evening. As soon as Mr.
I HaiÂ«ht took is seat, which was at about
j 9:20, the Rev. Mr. Hood, pastor of the
church, arose, wituout giving the Rev. Mr.
Foster a chance to address the meeting,
and anncuncsd tnat the services would
clos with a prayer.
His abrupt manner in drawing the meet
! ing to a close is considered as an insult by
some of the suffragists, who gave vent to
th ir feelings to-day.
They say that the action of the pastor
was a flagrant breach of the mo^t common
courtesy, and that they will not forget the
treatment received at his hands ior some
time to come.
"Skull and Keys" Difficulty.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 22.â Tbe trouble
which arose last Saturday night in the
Skull and Keys Social and Dramatic So
! ciety of the State University over the
resignation of three of its most prominent
members is not yet at an end. The active
j chapter held a meeting last night, at
J which a large number of the alumni were
| present to consider the offered resignn
tions, but no definite conclusion was ar
rived at.
Spinal Column Dislocated.

Wells of Â±Jrsiol street, a brother of Town
Treasurer I>aao W. Wells, feJl from the
roof of a building in San Francisco a dis

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1896.
SEARCHING FOR
HIS LOST WIFE
Mrs. Guilfoyle Eloped From
Sydney Five Years
Ago.
Her Hasbaad Followed Her to
Oakland, bat Was Again
Evaded.
ALMOST DECIDES TO GIVE UP.
Deserted Home and Children for
the Steward of a Merchant
man.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 22. )
For several days Ernest Guilfoyie, who
formerly resided at Sydney, has been
searching for his wife in this city, with
the aid of a private detective agency. Five
years ago Mr. Guilfoyle was a prosperous
merchant in New South Wales and his
MRS. ERNEST GUILFOYLE, Who Eloped From Sydney Five
Years Ago and Who Is Supposed to Be Still in Oakland.
business was to a large extent with people
interested in shipping. His family con
sisted of himself, his wife and two chil
dren, and at his comfortable home ne fre
quently entertained the officers of the ves
sels in port with which he transacted
business.
He entertained one guest too many.
The hand?ome steward of a Scotch ship
made such a favorable impression on his
wite that she was led to forsake her vows
and a few weeks later husband and chil
dren were deserted.
Guiifoyle sold his business, placed his
children with friends and started out to
find his wife. He followed the foolish
couple to Newcastle, N. 8. W., and later
was on their track in Chrislchurch, New
Zealand, but he conld never overtake
them.
About six months ago he heard that his
wife and her lover were living in San
Francisco and he at once went to that city
and obtained positive evidence that they
resided as man and wife at different local
ities, the man making short voyages on
coasting vessels and changing his re^i
aence nearly every trip.
About a month ago Guilfoyle learned
that they were living at a lodzing-bouse
on Washington street. He came to this
city about a week ago and has concluded
that be has again been evaded.
"I had a little money when I sold my
business," said Mr. Guilfoyle to-day, "but
I have spent nearly every penny hunting
for my wife. I am convinced she would
return to me and her children if I could
only find her. We bad been married
nearly ten years when she left home and
there was never a quarrel worthy of the
name between us. I cannot do anything
more than I have done. 1 am assured
that she lived here not more than a month
aeo, but my search has been in vain ao far
as meeting her is concerned. I have about
made up my mind to give up tue search
altogether. "

Senator Frank McGowan of Eureka ar

the present campaign as the result of an
I accident last July, but still maintains an
active interest in the present controversy.
To a Call reporter he said yesterday : ; 'â 
The three certainties now are death,* taxes

Notably among these proposed ventures is the
construction of a railroad from Shasta County
to Humboldt Bay. ; I have yet to; hear of any
enterprise waiting for tlie election of Bryan. v
â¢ The people ol Northern California have been
shamefully treated; The protective duty has
been taken off lumber, our chief product, and
as a consequence $30,000,000 worth of foreign
lumber has r been sold in the United States
since the Wilson bill became a law. This has
deprived us of a market, taken that amount of
money out of the country .that should, have
been puid for our own labor, and sriven labor
and money to foreign lnbor and'manufactu-e.
The Government has received about $4500
duty on these importations of lumber. '

sheep business have- been reduced almost' to
absolute poverty by the present tariff laws â

"favor of free wool,", and seems to rejoice over
the ruin his policy has wrought. ." : â¢

States over $23,000,000 worth of wool since
tne Wilson bill went into effect. As it was pro
duced by cheap labor on cheap lands it sold
for much less than our wool men could sell
their product; the consequences were that our
wool was not sold, 1 the cheaper article being
taken by the buyer, and our product remained
on the hands 01 those who raised it; they had
no money to pay shearers, teamsters or others
who worked for them. As "laud* 1 depend for
their vaiue upon their production, capacity
and the : price of product, the failure of our
wool market for us brought th'u price of lauds
down so low that 50 per Cent, of the former
value cannot be obtained, a great number of
our sheep rancnes a: mortgaged and .the . ac
cruing interest is simply, taking:' the ranch;
however, in most instances, tne banks refuse
to lake deeds of the places, claiming: that if the
owners cannot make interest it is of .little use
for; any one else to try. ; The men who nave
money thus loaned almost variably say:
'â¢Wait until McKinley is elected and . all will
be well."
The Call, however, has called the attention
of the people of this State in some very ably
written articles on both these questions, show
ing most effectually how the Wilson tariff law
has depressed and a. most destroyed these two
industries which in former years under a pro
tective' tariff yielded labor and; property to
many people â  and : brought prosperity to ..'a
goodly number of our citizens. -We appreciate
very high I v what The Call has done for us in
th behalf. ."' . â¢;.- ; . .
' The Republicans will carry Humboldt by a
handsome majority. We entf rtaiued some
fear aÂ» the earlier part of the campaign of an
adverse . result, 1 but our 'â : people, who ;" are
sensible and patriotic, have come ;to the con
clusion thai there is > nothing; in. % the > "wild
wail of wandering .Willie" for free silver; they
cannot see how iree silver would â â , give a day's
work to any oi our people;: how it would pre
vent the importation of foreign-grown wool or
foreign lumber, or protect a single industry
against the disastrous competition of cheap
labor. â .-â  ' " â¢â â -' :- r; '-. ' â 'â¢â 'â  â  ' ''â /.'â '-â â ; ;
â If we start the wheels of industry the labor
that gives spirit, life and promise to all our
institutions will be the magnet to draw into
circulation the money now hoarded because
of the lack of confidence in our present poor
industrial system. Then if a voter had no
knowledge â - of the- financial â  question, or 'â  the
benefits of protection, or the disasters of low
tariff, lie could not hesitate to cast his vote
for McKinley because of the marked difference
in characters of the two candidate-. McKiuiey
represents all that is dignified, patriotic and
conservative in our National life; he is a true
patriot who has risked his life in defense of
the institutions of our country; he â  hai un
swervingly maintained a wise and. inte.iigerit
championship of American labor and has ever
been the defender oi the best elements in our
industrial life. Every interest of our country
would be safe In his hands.
Mark what I tell you. McKinley will be
elected by a large majority, confidence will be
restored, business will revive, labor will be
again engaged, and every Bryan advocate who
has enough sunse to pound sand in a gopher
hole will be proving au alibi for, the next four
I years for the benefit oi himself and children.
CHARGED WITH DEFAULT.
A Warrant Issued for Treasurer Whip
pi. <>r Xl uiliurtt Itodge, I O. O. l r .
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 22.â The where
abouts of W. H. Wfaipple of Eimhurst is
being sought by Constable Weldon of
Brooklyn Township, who has a warrant
for his arrest on a charge of felony em
bezzlement. It is believed he is making
his way down the San Joaquin Valley in a
bugey, having left his residence with a
horse and buggy with a boy oq the Bth
insr.
Whipple was treasurer of the local lodge
of Odd Fellows and :iad $355 0f the funds
of the order when he 1 ft, and it is for
taking this that be is wanted. The com
plaint was sworn to by Walter N. Damon
betorn Justice Lawrence. He was a single
man, about 40 years of age, and very pop
ular. He spent money freely and was
good to rich and poor alike.
It was only about six weeks ago that
Whipple bought the "Billy Peru" saloon
ou the 6an Leandro road and had an
"opening" that is yet the talk of the
vicinity. He sold out to his partner in
about three weeks and a weelc later left on
his present journey. The boy went about
200 miles wun him, but when he was told
that they were to drive through the desert
his heart failed and he returned home.
It is supposed W ipple pushed along and
may now be well on to Mojave.

stories about the doctor that he said would
make "rich reading."
The doctor and the editoi had a personal

"I'M FOR PHELAN!"
SHOUTS S. RAINEY
People Snicker While the
Warm Springs Sage
Is Talking.
The Junta Nominee for Mayor
at Last Declares His In
dependence.
CHOICE JOKES PRO AND CON.
Marvelous Story of the Alleged Dis
interestedness of the Fire De
partment Boss.
The unexpected has happened. Men
will say tlwt the improbable, yea, the im
possible has happened, when they are
told tbsjt Statesman Sam Rainey says he
is supporting as a candidate for Mayor
James D. Phelan, from whom he has no
expectation of patronage in the event of
that gentleman's election.
Marvelous as this may appear to the
minds of the people of San Francisco Mr.
Rainey is doing just this thing â unless
M^ Rainey is jesting, and the sage of the.
Warm Springs is known to like a joke once
in a whiltf, even if it be at the expense of
his friends.
That is not the strangest part of the
situation, for Mr. Phelan, the candidate
whom Mr. Rainey says he is supporting,
utterly discredits and repudiates Mr.
Rainey, and in some degree casts doubts
on his sincerity in the present campaign.
He has heard that members of the Fire
Department are for Mr. Dimond, the j
nominee of the Anti-Charter Democrats, I
and as Mr. Rainey holds c tight rein on
the political activities of the Fire Depart
ment it is not difficult to guess Mr.
Phelan's opinion.
"1 am not Mr. Rainey's candidate in
any sense cf the wora," said Mr. Fhelan
to a Call reporter. "It is known well j
enough that I was not his choice for the
nomination. He favored Colin M. Boyd, j
and he would have tried to nominate Mr.
Boyd if it hadn't been lor a break in the
convention, caused by the election of Mr. 1
Reynolds as temporary chairman.
"When Mr. Reynolds was elected it was !
not known that he was an A. P. A. As j
soon as that was found out it caused a |
commotion and Mr. Rainey wax no longer
able to control nit the votes with which he <
started. Several men who were opposed ]
to the sentiments represented by Mr.
Reynolds openly demanded that some- j
thing should ba" done to show that Mr.
Reynolds did not represent the senti- I
ments ot the convention on that point. I
Notably among them was Mr. Feuton of j
the Mint, who controlled one or two As- â¢
sembly districts ami who was indeppndeut
of Mr. Rainey. He insisted on taking his
own course and wa3 joined by enough I
others to force the issue. Mr. Rainey was
compelled to consider these demands, and
that was the way in which my nomination
came about.
"Mr. Rairrey had much influence in that
convention; tse balance of power, no
doubt, possibly the majority under ordi
nary circumstance?, bnt he couldn't con
trol all the elements after that storm hart
been raised on account of tne election of
Mr. Reynold?."
"You know that Mr. Rainey snys he is
givinp you his support, and that if this be |
true he would expect to control his |
share of the municipal patronage in the I
event of your election, do you not?" was
esked.
"F don't know anything about Mr. I
Rainey's expectations, and, as a matter of
fact, I don't know that he is supporting
me," said Mr. Phelan. "If he is doing so
it is entirely voluntary on bis part, as I
have not asked for his help in any way.
"It has been reported to me that some
members of the Fire Department are op
posed to me, but I have no personal
knowledge on that point."
Mr.| Phelan smiled pleasantly as he
thought of the joke involved in this pe
culiar state of sflair?.
"I* there any tacit understanding that
Mr. Rainpy is to wield an influence in
municipal affair?, should you be elected,
in pxebance for his support at the polls?"
"None whatever."
"Politicians of San Francisco marvel
that Mr. Rainey has all at once become so
disinterested as he pretends to be in sup
porting you," was suggested.
"I am'iiot responsible lor Mr. Rainey's
acts or words; lie *ill probably do as be
pleases," said Mr. Phelan. "Mr. Rainey
is a man with whom I have no acquaint
ance and I have sought no aid from him.
If I should be chosen Mayor I would not
consider myself hound to him in any
manner eith-r as to policy or municipal
matters of any character. The Mayor has
very little patronage under epcistinr laws.
It is scarcely worth mentioning. But in
any event I would not have any coalition
with Mr. Rainey."
This coolness and indifference on the
part of Mr. Phelan may be reg<||ded as ail
the more remarkable when Mr. Rainey's
simulated warmth for Mr. Phelan's inter
ests is taken into consideration.
"Oh, 3*es; I'm for Phelnn. I'm for
Plielan for Mayor," said Mr. Rainey when
asked how he stood in the local fieht.
As he uttered these words Mr. Rainey's
broad, good-natured face was a study. He
looked shrewdly at his questioner, as if to
judge the effect of his declaration. The
interviewer had negligently left his x-ray
apparatus at home, and, therefore, was
not prepared to cast a penetrating light
within the brain-cells of the Fire Depart
ment boss. If one might judge by out
ward appearance?, however, the "words
were of the lips only, not from the heart.
The manner was a trifle too demonstra
tive â '00 declamatory.
It may be an injustice to suspect Mr.
Rainey's sincerity, but such has been the
fate of disinerested, self-sacrificing pa
triots from the beginning of time, and
tho*e who know Mr. Rainey best may be
pardoned for the supposition that he has
Dot changed the policy, so lone acknowl
edged by him and his friends, of being In
politics for substantial returns. Possibly
he hns maintained his position as a boss
bj following this broad-minded, generous
plan. Then, acain, maybe he hasn't.
It may have been only a phantom, but
when Mr. Rainey declared, "I am for
Phelan," there appeared in the mind of
Ji is questioner a scene wherein a plethoric
turkey gobbler was "going for" a defense
less June nug.
"But Mr. Phelan says that he is under
no obligations to you; that he has not
asked for your support, and that if elected
would not be influenced by you in his offi
cial acts," said the reporter.
"Oh, that's all right. Mr. Phelan is
right; but I'm for him just the same."
A horse on tbe opposite side of the street
laughed outright at this witty remark by
Mr. Rainey, and the interviewer said:
"Pardon me, Mr. Rainey, but will not
this voluntary and disinterested devotion
startle some of your old acquaintances,
who have been accustomed to look upon
you as a 'practical' politician?"
Mr. Rainey smiled blithely, even be
nicnly, as he replied:
"Ou, I guess they'll be able to stand it.
I've done such things before."
â¢For instonce?"
â¢â¢Well, two years ago 1 helped elect three
Supervisors that I didn't know, just be
cause 1 heard they were good men." [The
horse laughed again.]
â â¢Indeed?"
'â¢Yes. After they were elected I met
one ol them, and passed the time o' day
with him and that was ali. Another was
Joe Dimond. I met him out at the race
track:, and introduced myself to him, and
that was all." [Third ana last laugh by
thr- horse.]
Mr. Rainey did not explain what be
came of the third Democratic Supervisor,
who did not make iiis acquaintance be
fore the election, nor did he divulge tbe
name of that unfortunate anonymous in
dividual, who, in all probability, is still
roaming thÂ« political jungles of San Fran
cisco yearning for an introduction to Mr.
Rainey and mourning because nobody
will show him the road to the St. George
stables.
Returning to the question of Mr.
Phelan's candidacy, Mr. llaincy said that
even though Mr. Phelan should repudiate
him, yet would he give support to the head
of the Junta's municipal ticket.
"I'm going for Mr. Pholan for Mayor,"
he repeated over and over again, as thoueh
he required t tie testimony of his own
voice to keep himself up to an appearance
of steadfastness In Consuming the ban
quet of crow that everybody in the City
knows is testing his capacity for political
dainties.
There is another stoiy going the rounds.
It is to tbe effect that Mr. Rainey re
cently told some of his acquaintances
that they could find him at the Phelan
headquarters in the Flood building. In
quiry was made at room 41 of the Flood
building, where the friends of Mr. Phelan
are doing their work, a:id it was ascer
tained that Mr. Rainey had never been
seen there.
Thinking some mistake might have
been made, and that Mr. Rainey might
have meant, that he was to be found at
the Junta headquarters, room 17, Flood
building, application was made at the
lan named place.
Richard O'Connor, chairman of the
Junta's purity of election committee, who
is in constant attendance at room 17,
said :
"We never sea Mr. Rainey. He never
comes here. Is he for Phelan? Yes, I
suppose so. He says he is, I understand.
No, I don't know what work he is doing
in ihe campaign. "
T. B. McGiunip, clerk of the Jnnta com
mi'tee, also constantly at room 17 during
business hour*, said:
"Mr. Rainey does not come here. Ht is
n gentleman to whom I never spoke in my
life. I never met him. I don't know
what he is doing in regard to tbe munici
pal ticket."
So goes the name of shuttlecock com
monly called Democratic politics in San-
Francisco, and it must be admitted that
tbe circumstances are most distressing to
those worthy eentlemen known in polit
ical circles aa "the push." With so many
conilicting elements in their party and so
mucti uncertainty as to the actual inten
tions of their principal bosses and sub
bosses "ihe push" are having a hard time
to eet in line, since success of eiher fac
tion will do them no good unless, by
chance, they cast their fortunes with that
faction before election time.
In the meantime the Republicans are
rallying to the standard of the regular
nominees of their party. The result will
be that it will make no practical difference
whether Mr. Rainey is iokinsr or not or
what be means when he says, "I am going
for Mr. Phelan."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1896.
SUPERVISOR KING
AND HIS DUCKS
How a Member of the
Board Bagged Wild
Game.
With His Dog Cowcatcher Joseph
Made a Great Killing Near
Suisun.
MUDHENS OR BLACK JACKS.
On Ihe Home Voyaga King Went
Overboard anJ Escaped by the
Hair of His Head.
. "Well, yon can talk to me as much as
you like . bout duck shoot i but I can
bless my s tuVs that the best man of the
solid nine is still in the land of the living,"
remarked Supervisor Joe King to a bevy
of friends who met him at the foot of Mar
ket street on his return from Suisun.
King always cherished the idea that he
was born to be a politician and -a sports
man, and a lew days airo when business
was a shade off color he induced Harry
Hart and a few of his friends to journey
with him to Suisun on a wild duck shoot
ing expedition. .
Bright and early on the mornine of the
day of the duck hunt King and Hart were
escorted to the Suisun landing, where a
guide piloted them safely into a boat.
Anticipating that t!ie Supervisor might;
possibly : banker for something to drink
during the day ft nice little ke? of "butter- |
milk" ] x and a loaf of French bread was i
snuely placed away in a corner of the
craft where the sportsmen could easily
place hands on them after the morning's
shoot was oven, ; .'.:'
According to Mr. ITart'3 version of the
hunt smooih sailing resulted until Spoon
bill .Slough was : reached, then the birds
commenced tolly in all directions. Kine's
dog Cowcatcher was acting very unruly,
and it took the combined efforts of the
two hunters to keep the thoroughbred on
deck. . .
"Why. I never saw such a dog in ray
life," said Hart; "every time he saw a
wad of grass floating down the slough he
wanted to go alter it. and Joe got into
such a rage that he had to keep constantly
sipping the buttermilk to keep his throat
coo!. I ;
""We finally* had to chain poor old 'Cow
catcher' 10 the bottom of the boat, as he
was scaring all the birds away, and then
the sport commenced in earnest. Joe
was shooting to the right and I was drop
ping birds on my left us fast as I could
load the gun.
"Well, after about one hour's shooting
on tie slougti we ran the boAt up on a low
bank anu commenced to count our game.
I was ignorant of the variety of duck we
had bagged, but Joe said they were 'black
Jacks,' and of very tine quality. We had
something like fifty-four birds, and I was
calculating. upon (he disposal of the game
on cur return to this City. when a market
hunter who was passing in a skiff hailed
me for a match. We invited him to take
a drink of â¢buttermilk,' which he did with
great'- â  relish, : and , then a ' big, bra ny
1 smii<* lit up his bucolic features.
â "â *." 'You must have had great shoot ijig th is
morning?' he stammered, ;as ' his eyes
feasted on the big bunch of black Jacks. M
11 'Yon betyer life we had a red-hot time
of it,' retorted Joe, as he pointed in the
direction of the big stack of game. 1
" 'What kind of ducks do you call them ?'
asked the hunter in a rather dubious way.
"'Them's black Jacks," said Joe, 'and
they are the finest duck that flies.'
"The hunter could not hold in the laugh
any Joncer, and as he turned to leave us
he whispered into ; my ear that we had
wasted our ammunition on. mud hens and
that no one but a Chinaman! would think
of eating thpm. ." â¢. â ,
'â¢To put it mildly King was as wild as a
hatter, and he swore vengeance on every
duck and hen in the three adjoining
counties.
"It was getting .late and we started for
Suisun after cettinz away with the but
termilk and the loaf of French bread.
Joe. was feeling line, and" as the tide
favored us the boat was literally flying
over the surface of the water when old
'Cowcatcher' jumped overboard ', after ;a 1
mudhon he had 'spied floating down the
slough. -â -..â '..'.'
. â  "Kine made a grab for the retriever and
in doing so he upset the cralt. But we went
head ; first, guns ; ! and. baggage. hen I
came up to the surface I grabbed the end
of the boat, but I could not see poor old
Jce anywhere. He was 1 weighted down
with rubber boots and fifty rounds ot am
munition, and the thought then flashed
through my mind that a good city father
would be missing from 1 the ! next meeting
of tne board. * I managed by paddling to
reach the shore, but, not a. thing -that
looked anything like a good Supervisor
could I fee. ". ..,"â â 
'Soaking wet I sorrowliilly tramped
along' the bank until I came opposite the
spot where the boat capsized; and to ;my
great surprise â  and joy 1 saw poor ; Joe ! s
curly, head sticking out between k a bunch
of bulrushes. IHe was gasping hard for

ALL WERE EATEN
BY CANNIBALS
A Noted Austrian Scientist
Murdered in the
South Seas.
He and Several of His Com
panions Were Ambushed by
the Natives.
THEIR BODIES NOT RECOVERED.
While on an Expedition Into the
Mountains They Were Attacked
by Head Hunters.
The arrival of the. Monowai from Aus
tralasia yesterday brought the details of
one of the most horrible massacres that
has ever taken place in the Solomon
group. A noted scientist and several of
his companions were cut down by the can
nibals and their bodies were never re
covered. The chances are that the dead
men were eaten.
The story is a tragic one. Henry Baron
Foullon yon Norbeck and an exploring
party landed on the island of Guadalcanar
from the Austrian gunboat Albatross to
make an examination of the island.
Striking into the interior the party sepa
rated and were ambushed. The following
is tiie.liÃt of the killed and injured:
Killedâ Henry Baron Foullon yon Norbeck,
Midshipman Armand de Beauiort. Seaman
Jakob Bokovic, Seaman Guslav Chalanpka, a
native guide irom Titiri, Petty Officer Peter
Maras.
Severely woundedâ Petty Officer Kolomon
Keupob, Petty Officer Peter Curcie, Petty Offi
cer Anton Covacevic, Seaman Anton Lovric,
Seaman Frantz Sepcic.
Slightly woundedâ Native Johnny Para
matta, Baron's servant Nickel.
A writer in t&e Sydney Morning Herald
tells the following story of the massacre:
You remember the Austrian man-of-war Al
batross that was on a training aDd scientific
cruise to the Solomon group? Well, after
cruising about among the different islands in
the group elie came to the north coast of
Guadalcanar some time In the beginning of
September and anchored at a place called
Tliiri. From there n party consisting of Baron
Foullon yon Norbeck, Lieutenant Budik, Mid
shipman de Beaufort, twenty sailors, the
Baron's two servants aud two native guides,
started for tne purpose of exploring a moun
tain in the interior of the isiand called the
Liou'a Head. (By the way, there was also,
another midshipman of the party.) The expe
aitiou started from the ship on Wednesday,
the sth inst.
After two days' marching one midshipman
and seven sailors returned, the men not being
able to stand the heavy walking in the bush.
The Baron's party that proceeded on reached a
camping-place at" the foot of the Lion's Head
on the evening of the 10th. Next morning the
party divided. The Baron, with three bush
men for guides, and accompanied by Lieu
tenant Budik and seven sailors nnd his two
servants, started about 8 o'clock in the morn
ing for the purpose of reaching the top 01 the
mountain. Those left at the camp were Mid-
BhiDman de Beaufort, six sailors and two
guides from the coast.
The Baron and his servants, with the native
guides, were in the lead going up the hill,
several natives being apparently near or
mixed with the party. When up near the top
they heard two shots fired in the neighbor
hood of the camp they had left, and at the
Fame time they saw what appeared to be a
bushman chief standing on the top of a rise
k little above them' making some signs.
Whether he could see the camp from where he
â was or not is not known, but he apparently,
on hearing the shots from the camp, gave the
signal to attack the Baron's party. Natives
from different parts immediately rushed on
them with tomahawks and clubs, but, as far
as I can gather, uo guvs. The Baron being en
tirely without arms of defense, a native rushed
at him with a tomahawk or small ax and cut
him down by a blow on the back of the nect.
Others -were killed, and several of the men in
tne camp only escaped by a scratch.
No doubt it would" have been some consola
tion to the friends of the dead could they have
been told that the bodies of their relatives
had received decent burial; but I think no
lives should be sacrificed or even risked to
satisfy what is, after all, but a sentimental
feeling. As the bushmen are cannibals, I
think it is highly probable that the bodies
would have been cooked and eaten long before
we could have reached the place.
The wholesale butchery of the Austrian
scientist and his companions has greatly ex
cited the traders who stop at the Solomon
Islands to deal with the natives, and the peo
ple of Sydney are talking of schemes for
policing the islands. They seem to think that
the home Government could not be expected
to defray the expense, but suggest that the
merchants of Sydney and the traders could
establish a police system and meet the ex
pense by charginc more for the goods which
they sell to islanders.
Speaking of the Solomon group and of
Guadalcanar a correspondent of the Aus
tralasian says:
It is the most fertile and beautiful island of
the group, and extremely rich in bird and in
sect life, many of the species being apparently
peculiar to it. The extreme length of the
island is about eighty miles and the breadth
about thirty. Its mountains reach a height in
one place ot 8000 feet (that is probably the
mountain Lion's Head, upon the slopes of
which this massacre took place), and there
are numerous peaks over 4000 feet. There are
many small islands in the group, and they
were first discovered by Mendana, a Spaniard,
In 1568, who gave them the name of the
Islands of Solomon, in order that his country
men, supposing them to oe the islands .whence
King Solomon got his gold, might be Induced
to colonize them.
That the late Baron was one of the most
distinguished of Austrian scientists was
the testimony of those who had had the
good fortune to meet the leader of this ill
fated expedition. A man about 50 years
of age, short, stout and not unlike in build
and stature the Prince of Wales. It was
specially for his convenience in making
Ins observations and researches that the
Albatross was fitted out and sent to the
South Pacific. When she called here a
few months ago she remained a consider
able lime in port, and v whs the intention
of the Baron to revisit Sydney toward the
end of this year.
H. M. S. Pylades is at present on patrol
duty in tbe Solomon group, and has by
this time probably taken some action in
connection with the massacre. The Dep
uty Commissioner would invoke the aid
of the captain of the Pylades in making an
attempt to capture the murderers, though
it is thought that to send a detachment of
men up in tbe mountains where this affair
occurred would be risking unnecessarily
the men's lives. Captain Davis, formerly
of H. M. S. Royalist, once led a party into
the bush and taught the Solomon Island
ers a lesson, but he ?aid it was done at a
tremendous risk, the men being at a terri
ble disadvantage in the dense vegetation
through which they had to march.
A RUN TO SAN RAFAEL.
To-Morrow'g Kxcuralon to the Presby
terian Orphanage and Yaim.
An excursion to San Rafael will be
given to-morrow for the benefit of tbe
Presbyterian Orphanage and Farm. Spe
cial return trip tickets can be bought for
25 cents at the rooms of the American
Tract Society, 637 Market street.
Tbe excursion will leave this City for
Bon Rafael on tbe 11 a. m. train of the
North Pacific Coaat Railroad. Lunch will
be served at the orphanage. Donations of
provisions, clothing or any useful article
will be appreciated. Free transportation
for ail packages under twenty- rive pounds.
Xbe officials of tbe road will do every
thing possible to make the trip a pleasant
one.
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst recently gave to the
orphanage a tract of thirty acres near
Fairfax, and on this the directors intend
to establish their institution. The chil
dren now under care are at present atay
ing at the old Gilbert House in San Rufael,
but the place is very small and the accom
modations inudequate.
WANTS ONE FARE.
Otto Turn Suden Says That Trannfers
Should Be Issued From Market
Street to Kearuy-Street Cars.
Otto turn Sud6n, an attorney, petitioned
the Board of Supervisors yesterday to
compel the Market-street Railroad Com
pany to carry passengers on its Market
and Kearny street lines for one fare or de
clare the franchise under which the latter
is operated void.
Tbe petitioner recites that in 1879 the
then Board of Supervisors granted a fran
chise for a road from the ferries and along
California street, thence to Market, and
along that thoroughfare to Eiphtn street;
that the franchise was later assigned to
the Market-street Railroad combine, and
that the Kearny-street line is operated un
der the oritiinal franchise, which calls for
a single fare along the entire route.
Mr. turn Suden also calls attention to
the fact that some of the rails of the orig
inal road are still cumbering the Btreet.
He stales that it is cleany the duty of the
hoard to force the combine to charge one
fare for the two lines.
The matter was referred to the Uity and
County Attorney.
HATS OFF WAS THE ORDER
Pleasing Feature of the Women's
Suffrage Benefit <Mat
inee.
A Corps of Young Lady Ushers
Attended to tbe Comfort of
tbe Audience.
A grand matinee performance was given
by the artists of the local theaters yester
day in t he Tivoli Opera-house foi the
benefit of the Woman's Suffrage Associa
tion. The affair was a success in every
respect, the attendance being large and
fashionable. As might be expected the
majority were women. As the people en
tered they were escorted to their seats by
a corps of pretty young women.
Just before the performance was bpgun
George E. Lask, the stage manger, stepped
to the front and requested tbat the ladies
in the audienca remove their head cover
ing. The order of "hats off" caused a
little surprise, but nearly all complied
with the request laughingly, and the men
applauded.
The musical part of the programme was
very pleasing and the volunteers did their
best. The conclusion, a pretty little ro
mance entitled "Sweetheart ," was well
received. In a financial way the benefit
was also a success, tbe Woman Suffrage
Association clearing something over $600.
NAT GOODWIN'S SHOW
Miss Unser Says There Was
All Kinds of It in
Australia.
Bat Mr. McLennan Says Everybody
Was Used Kindlyâ Nobody
F.orced Out.
Miss Dorothy B. Unser of the Nat Good
win company, which has been playing at
the Antipodes for some time, arrived here
yesterday on tbe Monowai. She says Nat
Goodwin has quarreled with everybody
nearly in his company, and that they
have all had a bitter time with him.
She says she was forced out of the com
pany and her part given to Gertrude El
liot, Maxine's sister. She also says that
Goodwin's tour was by no means a suc
cess. The lady's criticisms are very in
cisive.
"Even the men in the company," she
Baid, "shake in their boots when Goodwin
is around. He has them all scared to
death. Because 1 received some social at
tention he abused me from day to day."
On the same ship with Miss Unser was
J. B. McLenntn, who had Goodwin and
the other people of the combination under
contract, and G. Appleton, the business
manager. Mr. McLennan denied last
night that Miss Unser's comments were
well founded.
"I notice she says we played 'In Miz
zouri,' but what we did play was 'The
Gilded Fool,' " said Mr. McLennan. "The
young lady has everything mixed up. We
intended playing 'The Prisoner of Zenda,'
but when we got over there we found tbe
Australians were taking only light frothy
things this season, and we decided not to
put it on there.
"As for our having light houses every
body here knows how Nat Goodwin draws,
and about our losing money, we didn't
lose any, and couldn't, because we went
over under contract to Australian man
agers. 80 how could we lose any?. She
also implies that myself and Mr. Apple
ton were virtually discharged.
"How absurd that is will be seen when
I am myself the contractor for Mr. Good
win's services. Not only that, out he has
a year yet to serve with me. That year
will be put in in the United States, for Mr.
Goodwin will soon arrive. As for Miss
Elliott crowding Miss Unser out, that is
incorrect. Miss E.liott was encaged
from the first to play as leading lady and
Miss Unser was used only lor a little
time to fill in. Mitts Elliott is really a very
talented actress. In regard to Blanche
Walsh, who hat been hitherto alluded to
as also forced out of the company, that
is not the fact. She was paid off in full,
as all the others of the company have
been, ami Miss Walsh personally ex
pressed her thanks to me for thrt very
nandsome way she had been treated.*'

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1896.
A DUEL WITH
SWORD HID KNIFE
Two Japanese Cousins Have
a Bloody Engage
ment.
One Was Under the Influence
of Liquor, the Other Was
Sober.
BOTH ARE SEVERELY WOUNDED
The Room Where the Fight Took
Place Resembled a Slaughter-
House.
A desperate fight between two Japanese
occurred yesterday morning in a sailors'
boarding-house at 110 Prospect place, one
THE JAPANESE DUELISTS.
being armed with a cantana, or Japanese
sword, and the other with a long butcher's
knife.
One of the men is Harry Nishmoto. the
keeper of the boarding-house, and the
other is his cousin, Kitaro Nishmoto.
Both are in the Receiving Hospital in a
low state from their wounds.
Harry and his wife have kept the board
ing-house for the past six years. He is a
steady, hard-working man and his wife has
helped him to save considerable money.
Kitaro, on the contrary, bears a bad repu
tation.BAbout nine years ago he killed a
man in Vancouver, B. C, with a razor.
He was tried and sentf need to seven years
for manslaughter. His term expired
about a year ago and he came to this City,
introctucine himself to his cousin.
Harry kept him in his hotel, but aÂ« he
refused to work and was constantly bor
rowing money from Harry and spending
it foolishly Harry, at the instigation of
his wife, got him to leave the house and
paid board and lodging for him at a bouse
on Washington street kept by a Japanese
named Kitchi.
Kitaro continued to make demands for
money upon his cousin and finally Harry
refused to make further contrioutions.
Yesterday morning about 1 o'clock Kitaro,
while under the influence of liquor, called
at his cousin's place. He had been
making threats to Kitchi that he would
kill his cousin and Kitchi was warning
Harry when Kitaro entered. Kitchi
grabbed him and took a knife out of his
pocket.
Kitaro went to his room in Kitchi's
house and, arminer himself with a Japan
ese sword, returned to his cousin's house.
Harry's wife was with him when Kitaro
entered. The cousins had some angry
words and Kitaro drew the sword from its
scabbard and made a lunge at Harry, the
point entering his chest. Quick as light
night Kitaro made a cut at Harry and
opened his left cheek.
Harry's wife screamed for help and
rusheil between them. Harry, as Kitaro
was preparing to lunge at him and his
wife, seized a large butcher-knife and
coming to close quarters with Kitaro
slashed his left arm, the blade cutting
through to the bone. The next blow of
the knife opened Kitaro's left cheek, and
the next cut through Kitaro's scalp and
into his skull. Kitaro was not idle and
succeeded in getting in two blows on
Harry, one cutting his left arm and the
other his right ankle.
Harry's wife and Mrs. O'Neill, who
keeps a boarding-house next door and
'witnessed the fight, rushed out of the
house yelling for the police. Policemen
Crow'ey and Connolly heard them and
hurried to the house. Kitaro had fallen
underneath the bed and was lying in a
pool of blood. Harry had draeged him
self downstairs and was lying on a iouuge,
which was covered with his blood.
The patrol-wagon was summoned and
both nun were taken to the Receiving
Hospital. Drs. Weii and Rhine attended
to Kitaro's wounds and Drs. Bunnell and
O'Brien to Harry's. Harry is in a
dangerous condition from the wound in
his head.
The sword and butcher-knife were taken
to the property cleric's room in the City
Hall, and Harry, if he should recover,
will be charged with assault to murder.
AMONG THE WHEELMEN.
Annual Theater Party of the Asso
ciated Clubs Wednesday Evening.
The annual theater pariy of the Califor
nia Associated Cycling Clubs held at the
Tivoli Wednesday evening was a big suc
cess. The house was packed to overflow
ing with wheelmen and their friends, and
they thoroughly enjoyed the show and
the many side jokes that Ferris Hnrtman
cracked at their expense. The prizes won
by the riders in the recent ten-mile road
race of the association were distributed
between the second and third acts, which
gave the clubs an opportunity to cheer
and yell for their champions. It was a
sympathetic audience, and every one had
a jolly time.
Work is being pressed on the new
Velodrome racetrack and grounds, and
the track will probably be ready for
training purposes by the fore part of next
week.
The secretaries of the clubs belonging to
the California Associated Cycling Clubs of
this City received a letter yesterday from
one A. A. Friedlander, asking them to
attend a meeting Wednesday night, at
which plans would be discussed to assist
in the election of the various wheelmen's
candidates. This was merely a political
ru^e to secure the indorsement of several
candidates in whom the wheelmen have
no interest whatever, and as Mr. Fried
lander was so little familiar with wheeling
matters that he called the meeting on the
evening when the association was holding
its annual theater party, the end desired
wa3 not reached. The Wheelmen's Muni
cipal League is the only organization to
which the wheelmen will" look for instruc
tions in their political tights for the ap
proaching election.
Georee M. Hamlin of the San Francisco
Road Club will try for the coast ten-mile
road record next Sunday over the Fruit
vale-Haywards course, paced by three
tandem teams of the Bay City Wheel
men. Up to last Sunday Hamlin held the
world's tive-mile road record at 11:11 2-5,
when it wns lowered by C. M. Sniiih of
the Garden City Cyclers to 10:20. Hamlin
will go acainst that mark later on, but
feels sure he can knock bis time for ten
miles Sunday.
The Alameda Cyclers will hold a five
mile handicap road race over the San
Leandro-Haywards course next Sunday
morning. iLast Monday evening the club
elected the following officers: E.L.Gil
ford, president; V. A. Doud. vice-presi
dent; A. L. Behnemann, secretary; W.
M. Ramsey, treasurer; J. A. Carpenter,
captain.
There will be a large field of starters
in tbe Imperial Cycling Club's ten
mile handicap roadrace next Sun
day. The handicaps will be announced
later this week. I. R. Lind is quite liable
to lower frank Byrne's coast record of
24:27 in this race.
Walter F. Foster, tbe crack professional
of the Olympic Club Wheelmen, may try
for the rive-mile professional road record
next Sunday at San Leandro, paced by a
quadruplet, a triplet and two tanaem ma
chines. Foster is in splendid condition
and will show his rear wheel to some of

HEIRS WILL SUE A BANK
Six Thousand Dollars May Be

Strange Complications of the German
Savings Bank in the Collan
Estate.
Considerable interesting litigation prom
ises to ari3e at an early date over the es
tate of Philip Colian, who died at Fresno
in 1885 and whose Irish heirs have re
tained Attorney Oscar T. Shuck to protect
their interests here.
When Collan died he left many thou
sands In the German Savings Bank here
and . $1050 in the Odd .fellows' Savings
Bank.',: It was not known until recently
that Collan had left any heirs, for he lived
a quiet life and seldom spoke of relatives.
;".;-' â¢'The bankbooks snow, said Mr. Shuck
yesterday, "that he lived at Benton, Mono
County, when : he : opened the accounts in
the banks. ; Shortly after the died Patrick
Crosby; asked lor letters ; * on f his estate,
alleging that Collan : had given him his
bankbooks. The Fresno court gave letters
to Crosby arid declared ; him tne owner of
the bankbooks â  and then made an order
that there was no estate. On the strength
of that order Crosby got the money, about
$5000, < from the German -? Savings a Bank
and- presented f the 1 order to Odd Fel
lows' Bank, but Secretary Benson referred
him to Attorney .Tilden. and the order
was not recognized." --.â¢â " > - - :
Now that the heirs of Collan have been
discovered Attorney -Shuck 'will sue the
German Savings: Bank ; for the; amount,
now about $6000,' on the same grounds of
the j Odd i Fellows' Bank rejection. They
claim that ' if Philip Collan owned <{ the
account at his death and left a will it must
be "â >. admitted to â  probate r ; and â¢ the : estate
.properly settled and; distributed, and that
if he did not lcavo a will his estate must

erly distributed. * If Collan did moti not own

Georgie Mitchell Uronted a Divorce
From Her WilUn S Hus
band.
Judge Daingerfield -yesterday granted a
divorce to Georgie Mitcheil from Thomas
J. Mitchell and awarded her the custody
of their two minor children, $20 a mouth
alimony and the community property.
The ground of the divorce was Mitch
ell's acknowledged infidelity. He was ac
cused of having betn too intimate with a
Mrs. Annie Fairrield and acknowledged
having gone to a Stockton hotel with an
auburn-haired woman, but denied that it
was the lady named as corespondent.
E. L. Rhodes, Mrs. Mitchell's attorney,
while on the stand was asked by Mitchell
if he bad not been in love with Mrs.
Mitchell before her marriage. He denied
the impeachment, as he aiso denied ever
Having kissed her. â¢
Mitchell appeared very willing that his
wife should get a divorce and apreed to
almost everything asked. He was said to
be deeply in love witu M rs. Fairfield, as

Supervisor Benjamin has received a

The unfortunates also asked Mr. Ben
jamin whether it would not be possible to
prevent their removal from vheir present

a measure that has been ordered by the
Board of Health. Wnile they assign no

LAUD INVESTMENT
BROKE THE BANK
California Savings Society
Said to Be Insol

Decreased Value of Mortgage
Securities the Cause of
the Fall.
LAWYER VAN WYCK'S ADVICE.
Recommends That the Management of
the Institution B3 Changed
at Once.
The solvency of the California Savings
and Loan Society was yesterday ques
tioned by Attorney Sidney M. Van Wyck
Jr., who advised that the bank be not per
mitted to continue the conduct of its busi
ness on the present lines.
Mr. Van Wyck was recently appointed
appraiser of the collateral inheritance tax
due on the estate of David Hunter, and in
presenting his report to Judge Coffey re
ferred to the finances of the bank, much
of the personal property of the estate be
ing money on deposit with that institu
tion.
T he California Savings and Loan Society
was incorporated in 1873 and carried on an
ordinary banking business until Septem
ber 13, 1894. Most of the money of the
institution was invested in loans, secured
by mortgages on lands in the lower San
Joaquin Valley. In one instance $100 an
acre was advanced and in a number of
other cas^s $50 an acre was loaned. Twenty
an acre was about the smallest Joan made.
In 1892 and 1893 land values depreciated
greatly and in 1894 the bank found it diffi
cult to obtain even the interest on its
money. Borrowers were unable to float
their mortgages elsewhere and the bank
was forced to suspend.
The directors decided to set aside all
applications for withdrawals, and devoted
all the money on hand to the payment of
taxes on lands foreclosed on and to pro
rata payments to depositors. So far 13
per cent has been repaid.
Mr. Van Wyck says that he finds that
about $100,000 worth of deposit bcoks have
been sold to money-brokers, for which
books from 60 cents down to 46 cents on
the dollar have been realized. The latter
figure is now the bestthat can be obtained,
and at that there is no demand for the
books.
The report further says that there is
now due the depositors $827,586 77. To
offset this the bank holds real estate of the
value of $553,154 and unsettled accounts of
the book value of $400,301 58. Of these
accounts the appraiser says: "In view of
the large amount of real estate held by the
bank, of the large amount it is now
taking, of its high cost, ot the dullness of
the real-estate market and of the long
time before cash can be realized for the
land held, I appraise the accounts owned
at 46 per cent of the face value."
In conclusion Mr. Van Wyck says: '"I
am of the opinion that the society should
not be permitted to continue to conduct
its business as at present, in view of the
fact that its assets at their real present
cash values are not, so far as I have been
able to ascertain, equal to the amount due
depositors."
In the British Isles during the present
century seven instances have been re
corded in which the bride has married the
best man by mistake.
