"ATLANTA, Ga., Fept. 29.â The equi
iQctial storm which was reported moving
jefihward off Cuba two days ago reached
Ihe 'southern coast of the United States
;hiÃ morning and spread northward with
â edoubled fury. Reports received by the
inited Associated Presses to-nieht indicate
Hoss of eleven lives and tremendous dam-
Ige to property. The storm is beLeved to

lÂ»e Several days before the full extent of
the damage is known.
No intorniation has been received from
Â°.lny e point south of Brunswick, and it is
. 'eared 'that the damage in Southern Flor
<ia has been yrynense. The storm struck
o 'Brunswick shortly before noon, but it was
I. nidnighi'before.any report was ha<"< from
â¢.hatjalacs, and then only meager informa

pal there.^ But no names were .known, as

The wind reached a velocity of Bixty

From Savannah comes the worst news

Â°oss of life is larger than at any other

T*he storm, which had been lurking in
.h.eÂ° eastern gu f for the last few days,
_ 'wept c n3pidly. across Florida at 8 o'clock
his niQjning and without warning burst
ipon.Savannah. In haif an hour it had
lone' its work. The streets were filled
yith wreckage. Hardly a house in the
iky escaped without more or less damage,
.hough there are few comparatively total
. vrecks. Â»
Beiore the -storm was at its height tlie
veafher observer said it wduild not be over
orty miles ah hour. It began to rise at
Â° jl* o'clock. Hal) an hour later it was
lowing sixty tuilea an hour and the air
vas filled v;ith -flying debris. When the
ttnd reached aÂ°velocity of sixty-six miles
iti hour the instruments at the weather
itation were Dtown away.
The storm was terrific in its intensity,
txceeding thÂ» great cyclone of 1893, which
levastated the South Carolina coast. The
- ihortness of Us duration was all that
aved an annihilation of everything
jpitbin its range.
The storm came from the southeast and
iwept directly over the city. .â¢ Hardly a
>Ã¼blic building escaped its fury. The
orests and the city were laid in swaths.
The parks are in ruins and many build
ngs were razed to the ground. The im
mense Plant system pas^ertger depot was
he first building in the path of the storm
md was a complete wreck. The magniri
tent prize train of 'the Plant system ex
libited at 'the Cotton States Exposition
tnd stored in the shed was wrecked and
Â the cars are almbsl a total loss.
The Central Railroad of Georgia and
llabama Railroad freight warehouses on
he opposite side of the city were unroofed
tnd the wails demolished. The public
narket was blown in. Tie- theater was
lartialiy unroofed, and the Second Bap
lat Church is ajmost a total wreck.
The Savannah Hospital and tlie Georgia
Infirmary were unroofed. The city and
Kiburban street railway car sheds, in
vhich were stored twenty cars, were
>lown down. The Georgia Hussars'
irmory was badly dama cd. Nearly every
itore in the retail part of the city was
bore or less damaged.
The damage to the shipping was less
ban in 1893. The Norwegian bark
toseniouÃ, anchored in the harbor, was
'apsized. The German bark Cuba, loaded
frith naval stores for Hamburg, went
/ground .below the city. The bark Miza,
oaied with naval stores and ready for sea,
tas blown against the training wall five
biles below the city and is lying on her
ide.

against the Government jetty. Three of
her crew and Captain C. H. Murray are
supposed to have been lost. The others
were rescued by a tug. Two vessels at
quarantine were blown across the river
and are high ai.d dry.
The Uniied States revenue cutter Tybee
sustained slight damage. Small boats
were thrown about in every direction.
The Flora left at 9 a. m., with a heavy
cargo for Brunswick. She is in cl.arge of
Captain Jenkins, her owner.
The steamer Governor Stafford, Captain
Strobnar, was to leave Beanfort for Savan
nah at 10 o'clock a. m. Grave fears are en
tertained for the vessel. She was due at
Tybee at noon, and it is thought the storm
was at that hour at its height at the
island. The steamboat Star arrived frpm
Bluffton at 11 o'clock, getting in just in
time. The bark Hilda, owned in Savan
nah, left last nigbt for Brunswick, in tow
of the tug Cynthia, and no news has been
received of her. One hundred thousand
to $150,000 is believed to be a low estimate
of t. c damage to the snipping.
Telegraphic communication was cut off
at the beginning of th,e storm and no
wires have been working in any direction
since noon, this rep rt being sent by train*
for transmission from Miller, Ga. 'The
Western Union has its force of linemen
out in all directions. The only train to
arrive in the city since the storm began is
the northbound Plant system fast mail,
which arrived two hours late and is still
here awaiting information as to the con
dition of the track north of here. A spe
cial train whs sent out late this afternoon
over the Plant system, but has not yet re
turned. The Central Railroad will run out
a special train to-night. No trains have
passed over the Florida Central and Pen
insula Railroad. . ' ; ,
One of the most complete wrecks is
Forsythe Park, which has been the pride
of the city. Three-fourths of the trees are
blown down and are lying in every direc
tion. The city is a tangle of wires. ' The
streetcar lines stopped running soon
after the blow began and the cars are
standing on the tracks in every part of
the city. The warehouses on . the river
front were heavily damaged.
The Savannah Guano Company's mills,
Gomar, Hull & Co.'s guano works and the
Southern Cotton Oil Company's mill and
storage sheds on the river front were
badly wrecked. The heaviest damage
was sustained by Gomar, Hull Co., their
mill being almost a total wreck. ' â *
At Gordon wharf a flying timber' from a
building 100 feet away struck Wallace
Johnson, a clerK, killing him instantly.
\V. G. Thompson was killed at the
wreck of A. S. Bacon & Co.'s mill. Sev
eral people wer* also injured in the de
struction of Gordon's wharf.
Four negroes in Soiithville, a colored set
tlement in the southern portion of the
city, were caught under a falling roof and
killed. ' ..'.,'

Tne reports indicate that the damage
and loss of life will be greater than then.
MACON, Ga., Sept., 29.â News -received
from Brunswick, Ga., by passengers on in
coming trains is that a severe gale swept
over that section. The Oglethorp Hotel,
Ex-Secretary of the Navy "William C "Whitney and Bride (formerly
Mrs. Edith May Randolph).
the largest in the city, was unroofed and
windows blown out. Storehouses and ware
houses were more or less damaged and
some entirely demolished. Residences
were blown down, and it is certain that
lives, were lost, but no connection can be
had by wire. Teleeraph poles are down
for miles around.
CHARLESTON. S. C.,' Sept. 29.âBlow
ing at the rate of sixty-two miles an honr
a pale of cyclonic fury swept Charleston
to-day from end to end. At 11 o'clock the
sky filled rapidly with ominous looking
clouds and Â«oon the wind began <to swirl
and tear throu.'b trees and around build
ings. From noon until about 8 o'clock the
wind. rose rapidly and the official record
showed that sixty-two miles per hour was
reached. Trees, fences and loose signs
came down. Almost before the storm had
reached a serious point here it was under
stood that the city was partially shut off
from telegraph communication with the
world. At 5 o'clock this afternoon in
quiries at offices of the telegraph com
panies developed the fact that Charleston
was entirely cut off. Not a wire was
working in any direction. During the
height of the storm hundreds of people
went down on the south and east battery.
Over the seawall on both fronts the waves
dashed in cataracts. The walls and grass
plats on the south side were submerged
about 1 o'clock and the water extended to
the asphalt driveway.

noon in the pretty little stone church of
St. Saveun by Rev. C. 8. Lefflngwell, the

thronged with people long before noon,
and as there were no formal invitations to
the affair the townspeople and society cun

roses, laurel, hydrangeas and potted
plants.
Promptly at 12:30 the bridal party en

adorned with pink roses, and wore a bon
net with forget-me-nots and roses. Mr
Whitney wore a black Prince Albert coat.
The service wa.Â« over in ten minutes and
Mr. and Mrs. Whitney walked down the
aisle and were driven to the Anchorage,
the home of the bride, where a wedding
breakfast was served to a few intimate
friends.
The invited guests were: Mr. and Mrs.
Frederick Gebhardt, Mrs. J. Frederick
May (mother of the bride). Mrs. C. S.

time. Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Randolph
decided last week to have the marriage
come off as soon as possible, and at a pri
vate dinn r on Sunday at Malvern cot
rage, where Mr Whitney has been stay
ing, the time of the wedding was an

Mr. Whitney regretted very much the
inability of bis children to attend. He
says there has been no estrangement.
Harry Payne Whitney and his wife, who
nave just been married, did not attend
the wedding, as they are to leave Lennox
for New York, thence to go to Vancouver,
B. C, where they are to sail on the Em

FROM THE MONONGAHELA
Identification of the H ailess
Body as That of Colonel
Fairy Lee Downs.
Was a Well-Known Ba timore Attor

PITTSBITRG, Pa., Sept. 29.â Sunday
last the head ess body of a man was found
in the. Monongahela River, near Elizabeth,
and later the head Â«a> discovered buried
in the sand. It is now said that the dead
â nan was Colonel Parry Lee Downs of
Baltimore.
Colonel Downs was a well-known attor
ney of Baltimore. He stood high socially
and had been a member of the staff of ex-
Governor Jackson. On the morning of
January 31 he was arrested in bis home,
2113 Maryland avenue, charged with forg
ng tne name of bis mother, Mrs. Mildred
C. Downs, as indorser of a sixty-day
promissory note for $2400.
When arraigned at the Central pc 'cc
-talion he waived an examination and
was released on $2500 bail for court, the
bail being furnished. The colonel disap
peared from Baltimore, and the detectives
have been fruitlessly searching the coun
try for him for the past seven months.
Since bis disappearance several other
forgeries have been charged against the
colonel.

ALL THE TICKET IS RECEIVED
Mr. Hinton Aeeepts the
List of Candidates for
. the Legislature,
NOMINATED BY THE AUDI
TORIUM CONVENTION.
This Makes the Filing of the Reg
ular Republican Ticket a
Harmonious Whole.
LEGAL OPINION AS TO THE REGIS
. TRAR'S ACTION.
Conference Committees Appointed by the State
Central Committee to Harmonize
Opposing Interests.
Registrar Hinton last evening placed on
the official ballot the nominations made
by the Anditorium convention for the
Senate and the Assembly from the Fourth
and Fifth Congressional districts.
This completes the riling of the whole
ticket nominated by the Repuolican Mu
nicipal Convention in the Auditorium.
The Registrar did not act in the matter
until he had made himself thoroughly
familiar with the law on the subject and
the history of the case togetner with
the precedent* â¢stablished by all the
political parties in tfiis State. Then he
consulted not only his own attorney, but
some of the most eminent lawyers in the
City, and they were unanimously of the
opinion that it was his duty to tile the
Auditorium convention ticket, including
the candidates for the Senate and Assem
bly nominated by that convention. A
this advice agreed with his own opinion of
the matter he had no hesitation in- recog
nizing the convention presided over by
Thomas D. Kiordan as the legitimate suc
cessor of all the Republican conventions
that dad preceded it in the history of this
City.
The long-established and undisputed
reputation of Mr. Hinton as an honest,
conscientious man and as a faithful ser- '
vant of the people is a sufficient reply to
the Republican bolters who have been
making the air d.zzy with their clamor for
weeks past
As soon as the news of the Registrar's
action reached downtown leading Repub
licans desirous of the mccess of the ticket
called upon Chairma : Thomas D. Rionlan
and J. Alva Watt, who made such a
powetful argument before the State Cen
tral Committee in the afternoon, and ex
tended to those two gentlemen their most
hearty congratulations.
The action of the Registrar settles the
dispute wliich has scandalized the cauje
of Republicanism in this City for many
weeks past. The bolters, headed by Mar
tin Kelly and Senator Mahoney, cannot
get on the ticket except by petition, as
provided for in the purity of election law.
but it is not extected that they will brave
public opinion by thus putting' an inde
pendent ticket in the held to assist the
Democrats.
The Republican County Central Com
mittee aas raado to Messrs. Kelly all* the
concessions that could, in honor and short
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
of absolute surrender, have been made by
any party to another.
It took down Dinkelspiel for Congress
and Montague for Presidential Elector in
the Fourth Congressional District in order
to promote harmony, and left the field
clear for Thomas B. O'Brien, the nominee
for Congress in that distr ct.
The complete regular Republican ticket
is now in the field witn a full list of can
didates for municipal and legislative
offices. All that remains for good R pub
licans is to support it loyally and stand
shoulder to shoulder for McKiniey and
protection.
An eminent attorney, high in the con
fidence of Registrar Hinton, said to a
Call reporter last night that the position
of the Auditorium or regular Republican
convention and County Central Com
mittee was unassailable. H<Â» could not
see how the State Central Committee
could acquire any jurisdiction in the
matter.
"Assuming that that committee should
create or attempt to create a new conven
tion," he added, "it would have no author
tv wbatev&r. It would be revolutionnry
and violent. But assume that it should
create a new convention and nominate a
new ticket, how could it get that ticket on
the official ballot? The regular Republi
can ticket stands on the official ballot and
it cannot be taken off. Not a single name
can be taken off it unless the candidate
dies or resigns. The State Central Com
mittee cannot legally call a convention of
iis own creation either before or after the
session of the regular County Convantion,
nor can the State Central Committee prop
erly interfere except by request of all the
parties to the controversy. Local organi
zations are extremely jealous of the inter
ference of State organizations, and State
organizations are jealous of interference
by local organizations.
"The convention which nominated the
ticket that has been accepted by the Regis
trar is the legitimate successor in lirfe of
descent of the Republican County Com
mittee, and the Republican County Com
mittee, of which Mr. Manwarine is chair
man,-is the regular lineal descendant of
the Republican County Convention,
which preceded it. Tlie Registrar ascer
tained that these Were the facts, and the
certificates of nomination beins in due
form he placed them upon the official bal
lots. He is the highest authority, and there
is no rerae iy forKell^ and Mahoney, exceut
to apply to the Supreme Court for a writ
of mandate to compel the Registrar to do
something else."
The rooms of the Republican State Cen2
tral Committee were too small to hold the
crowd that assembled yesterday to button
hole the. members of the State Central
Committee who were about to hold a "ses
sion, with a view of harmonizing the
= opposing elements of the Republican
party of this City.

The Sub-ccmruittees fixed 10 o'clock this
forenoon as the time for the conference
witn the representatives of the regular
Republicans and the Keliy-Mahoney
bolters.'
-In yesterday's session of the State Cen
tral Committee J. Alva Watt appeared for
the regular Republican convention and A.
Ruef for the bolters. Mr. Watt made a
clear clftan-cut statement showing how the
present County Committee was the only
and legitimate eucces^or of the County
convention of 1592, and for a scqre of
years back, and now the present conven
tion had been "appointed Oy the present
County Committee in accordance with
vrecedents frora the time whereof the
memory of Californians runneth not, nor
jurupeth nor walketb to the contrary.
â â ' Mr. R.uef made the usual chestnutty ar
gument that because the .National Com
mittee had recognized the Fourth Con
gressional District ( onvention as a Con
gressional Convention, Mem*. Keliy and
-Mahoney were entitled to create a Repub
lican party of their jDwn and give birth to
a County Committee and a County Con
vemion'wuhoiu tather or mother.
The busirÂ»ess men and ouier vistors who
had beer. invi;ed to attend the meeting
were very ruu^h impressed with the argu
ment of Mr. Watt. It was the consensus
of the 'opinion of the conimitteemen and
. visitors alike that Mr. Watt's argument
â¢and sbowhig of facts were unanswerable,
and that the convention represented by
him was the regular Republican Muni
cipal Convention of San Francisco.

o Oat street, between Baker and Stanyan.
He further stated that the matter of hav
ing Golden Gate Park lighted by electricity
,* was in a fair way to be accomplished ; that
â¢ it bad been favored in the platform, of
"nearly every political convention, and
.that it had been favorably mended
by Governor liudd to the Park Commis
sioners.
â¢ Here Salfleid apologized for
having been presented to the jitonie of
Sai* Francisco as a candidate lor Super
visor by what he called the Slahoney-
Kelly .gang. He said: 'I baa the njis
fortune to be suggested as a candidate for
Supervisor by the Mahoney- Kelly gang. I
think you call }hem. IÂ»m not seeking
â¢ any office and don't want any office. It is
veryoaunoying to have people come up to
you and address you as Supervisor. I, of
course, tlianktd them for their action, but
I felt more like kicking them. It is true
that I have supervised "this ward as well Â»n
the Supervisors who are paid for the job,
but that cuts no figure."
B. E. Henricksen moved that a commit
tee of three be appointed to wait upon the
Mark^-street Railway Company and ask
them to remove all superfluous rails and
Blots on Stanyan and Oak streets.
The chairman stated that it has come to
his knowledge that the Market-street Rail
way Company was opposed to the removal
of these exiraorails and slots, for the rea
â¢ son that it contemplated* their use as con
: doits in the future construction of electric
linee in place of the present cable-roads.
Chairman Salfield vacated the chair
and -presented a resolution sta'.ing that it
*as the sense of the club that the ordi
nance giving .the Park Commissioners the
right", to grade streets abutting the park
and to fence in the park to the outer line
of the sidewalks of the streets bounding
the park be repealed. After considerable
i debate the resolution was adopted.
A. J. Fritz moved that the street com
mittee of the ciub take the necessary ac
tion to provide for the cleaning of Clayton
street between Waller and Haight. "The
motion was adopted. â¢
Rudolph 3li>lir moved that the street
committee be instructed to obtain three
, entrances to the Panhandle, on each side
of it, and ilxe motion was unanimously
carried,-
The street committee was also in
structed to procure the removal of the
fence surrounding the Panhandle and the
erection of a low cement coping in its
place.
Chairman Salneid stated that a branch
fostorhce had been partly promised by
the Pustoftice authorities next year.
Just before the meeting, adjourned
Chairman Salfield announced the follow
ing committee to wait on the Market
street Railway Company relative to the
extra rails on Stanyan and Oak streets:
A J. McFarland, N. M. Lund and B. C.
Henricksen.
In the notices sent out to members of
the club it was announced that a discus
sion of municipal candidates would take
place last night, but Chairman Salfield
explained that inasmuch as all the con
ventions had not yet made their nomina
tions such a debate would be premature.
He suggested to postpone it until the next
meeting of the club and his suggestion
was adopted.
BRYAN'S FLOW OF

Theme During a Trip

Says He Must Reach the People
Because His Utterances Are
Not All Recorded.
ADMITS HE MAY BE MISTAKEN
Endless Orations by the Worried,
Wandering Ycuth of the Shallow
Piatte Region.
JERSEY CITY, N. J., Sept. 29.â 1n his
trip through to New York this afternoon
Mr. Bryan made a brief speech at the
Academy of Music here and a briefer one
to the crowa outside the building. In the
course of his speech he said:
One of the reasons why in this campaign I
have departed somewhat from precedent and
have gone over the country myself is because
it has enabled me to reach the people them
selves: whereas if we had more daily papers
we could reach the people through them. If
my going around 'results to my disadvantage
it is better for the people to find out before
election than alter. The trouble is, our op
ponents are all the time talking about main
taining the parity between two metals and
neglecting the fact that under the gold
standard we have failed to maintain a parity
Detween a dollar and property.
They entirely ignore the effect of legislation
when we desire legislation, although they are
very conscious of the potency of legislation
when they use it on their side. If in 1873
they had proposed a law such as was passed in
that year, closing the mints to the free coinage
of silver, and. had Â«aid to them: "Why,
law Can do nothing on this subject, commerce
regulates the values of these things," what
would they have said? They would not have
been content to let commerce regulate them.
Then they wanted the -law to step in and
strike down one of the money metals and give
to gold the monopoly of mint privileges, and
when they have done that they have bios-
Eomcd'out into believers of non-interference
on the part of the Government. [Applause.]
If they tell you law can do nothing, that com
merce is everything, remind them of the taw
of 183-4. The advocates of the gold standard
will tell you that from the beginning of our
financial history down to 1884, go, was at a
premium and silver the money in common use
amou;,' the people.
They will tell you that after 1834 silver was
at a premium and gold was the money in cir
culation among the people. What changed
the habit of our people and made them "stop
using silver and commence using gold ? Was
it commerce? It was a little law of but a few
words (hat changed the ratio from 15 to 1 to
16 to 1, and by so doing gave the advantage to
silver. [Applause ]
That change put silver at a premium be
cause there was a demand for silver in Franco
at a more favorable ratio than ours; and
therefore. our silver either went to France,
where it could be coined at the ratio of 15)4 to
1, or if it stayed here it stayed at it* con*
modity value.
When these people" tell you commerce Is
above law you point to that little law that
changed the customs of the people and money
in. use among them in a night. [Applause.]
You say law cannot affect values. Suppose a
public buildlug In to be located in this town,
why Is it everybody wants the building located
"near, his land? Because It raises the value of
his land. A new harbor, or the deepening of
a river of the opening of a port brings busi
ness, to that locality, ana that new business
brought there by law creates a new demand
for property and that property rises by act of
legislation. I. have toft you this because I
want you to understand when we speak of the
power of law to affect the value of silver we
are simply applying to silver the same princi
ples which we recognize will apply to every
thing else. Some people think siivercan be
produced without limit. I know one way to
cure a man ot that iden. Let him go out and
try to rind 'he t-i!ver mines and prove by his
own experience how easy it is to iuerease the
suppiy of silver. [A'ppiause.]
it is true of silver as it is oi goldâ that many
seek and few find. Tncy talk about the cost of
production in silver. â¢ There is no ba' is upon
which you can calculate the cost of produc
tion. No two urines in the United States pro
duce silver at exactly the same price per
ounce, and no one mine produces stiver at
exactly the same price per ounce year after
year in succession. Mining is gambling, and
the man who gets the winning paddles makes
money; but a g'catT many buy paddles and
never make anything. .
You think it is so easy to find silver, kc
member the people of the world have searched
for it since history began, and yet If nil the
sliver now existing in the form of coin were
melted down into one great lump ii has been
estimated that lump would only be sixty-six
feet each way. That is that great overwhelm
ing product of silver that people are afraid
will run in upon us aiid -overwhelm us if we
open our mints to the free coinage of sliver.
Our opponents tell us we are trying to change
tbe yardstick. We tell them tnat they havo
been changing the bush 1 measure and are
compelling tanners to put two bushels of
product* Into one bushel. Instead <>i shorten
ing the Hours of toil in n day they are trying
to shorten the number of days a man will find
work in a week or a year. A's the gold stand
ard goes on doing its deadly work it simply
means there will be more idleness and more
suffering. We can say of the gold standard
that all its ways of wretchedness and all of its
paths are ruin to the masses of the people.
[Applause.] There is no danger of foreign
coin coming in here and overwhelming us, be
cause it is worth more at home. There is no I
danger of all the annual product Coming to us,
because all the other nations that use silver I
must have their shares. Trie arts must have
their share. We simply have to use for what
other nations and the arts do not consume,
instead of having too much I am afraid we
will have too Ifttie money men.
In the development of the resources of this
country we cannot use more money than can
be utilized by a simitar number of people in
any other part oi the world. But instead of
haying an increased amount of. money to
carry on an increased business and to give us
increased development, we have a decreasing
currency and the Republican party offers no
remedy for the situation. [Applause.] We
have in circulation among the people Â£150,
-000,000 less this year than we had two years
ago. And yet the Republican party proposes
to maintain our present financial lyiteiu, no
matter what may come, until foreign nations
get so tired of it that they will help os to get
rid of it. [Great applause.]
At the conclusion of his. address Mr.
BTyan went to the balcony in front of the
hall and addressed the crowd briefly.
IN THE TAMMANY WOMAN.
Bryan Talk* About â , (Hirer to a Big
frntvrt at ArtÂ© Icrk.
NEW YORK, N. *Â Sept. 29.-It has
been mauy a decade since the historical
Tammany Wigwam has held such a com
pact mass of humanity as that assembled
there, to-night to hear W. J. Bryan and
o;her speakers. Although 8 o'clock was
.the hour set for the proceedings to be in,
three hours earlier the door 3of the meet
ing place were besieged by a clamorous
throng. It kept growing in numbers until
6 o'clock, when the doors were thrown
open. There were then enough people
assembled in the vicinity of Tammany to
fill the wigwam twice over. There is but
one gallery ia the hall, and in a very short
space of time this was jammed. The seata
had been removed from the orchestra floor
for the purpose of economizing space and
the crowd waa compelled to stand through
the meeting.
It was one solid mass, enthusiastic from
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1896.
tbe ttart and good-natured, despite the
uncomfortable environments. The hall
had been but sparsely decorated with flags
and banners. Over the platform were tbe
portraits of Bryan and Sewall. In the
gallery was stationed a brass band, and
the patriotic tunes rendered aroused the
exuberance of the, crowd. A liberal sup
ply of small American flags bad been
passed around and these were kept con
tinuously waving by the enthusiastic
shouters.
Tammany was determined that every
word uttered by Mr. Bryan should be
heard by those in the ball, and with this
end in view had erected a sounding-board,
in the shape of a canopy, directly over
the speaker's position on the platform,
the candidate standing under it while
speaking.
The meeting was called to order by
John W. Keller, the presiding officer of
the evening, at 7:45 o'clock. At that hour
there were over 6000 persons congregated
in the ball.
Resolutions were read and adopted in
dorsing tbe platform adopted at the Na
tional convention held in Chicauo and the
State Democratic Convention at Buffalo,
and the candidates named on those occa
sions.
Immediately after the adoption of the
resolutions Mr. Bryau, accompanied by
Mr. Sewall, Senator Thomas F. Grady,
Senator Daly of New Jersey and George
Fred Wilhams of Massachusetts, appeared
on the platform. A great outburst of ap
plause and cheering greeted Mr. Bryan's
appearance. The moment the audience
caught sight of him, hats, handkerchiefs
and American flags went up in all parts of
the hall. Cheer after cheer rent the air.
The cheering and applause continued for
eight minutes, and at the conclusion Mr.
Bryan was introduced by the chairman.
After thanking Tammany, Mr. Bryan re
peated his silver argument, with a lew va
riations.
ARE PNFESNOES CORRCED?
J{oss of Stanford B rites Some Demo
cratic Campaign Material.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 29.â Professor E.
A. Koss of Leland Staniord University,
Cal,, lias written a letter charging that
college professors are coerced into talking
fur the gold standard. The letter was to
day -given out at Democratic headquar
ters:
Stanford University, Cnl., Sept. 23, 1896.
Hi'ii. Jr.mts D. Richardson, Chief National
Dcvwcratic Literary Bureau, Chicagoâ Dear Sic:
You inquire If I think there is perfect freedom
of exprexiion among college professors
ihrouguout the country on the money ques
tion. I would say that I don't think there is.
I don't know th?re are many who wish to
champion National bimetallism, but I am
very sure that if there were such they would
in many cases be compelled to surrender their
present live.lhood in order to do so.
My basis for this belief is experience In va
rious Eastern institutions; the attitude of
boards of trustees regarding teaching on sub
jects much less important than the mou-y
question, and knowledge ot the notions boards
oi trustees, comprised of wealthy individuals,
entertain regarding their supervision of
economic teaching. Dennitizing the second
point, I wou.d mention the experience of Pro
fessor H. C. Adams in Cornell University, Pro
fessor Ely in Johns Hopkins University, Pro
fe>sor Commons in Indiana University and In
Syracuse University, Professor BemisinCni
c*eo University and in connection with other
institutions.
Being on the coast, quite oat of touch with
my professional brethren, 1 am nut Â«ble to
cite very many definite cases of coercion on
the present question. I -will mention, how
ever, the fo. towing: Professor J. S. Clark of
Columbia told a friend of mine that he Re
lieved Proiessor Andrews muÂ»t certainly be
Jorced out of the presidency at Brown Univer
sity. At the meeting of tne American Eco
nomic Association last winter I was told that
one Professor Duvray of Pen^ylvanla had
strong leauingg toward tree silver and that his
colleagues had to labor bard to hold him back.
Later I listed Â« gentleman connected with that
Institution what would happen if the pro
fessor should declare for free silver. His
answer was immediately, "He wou d lose his
position." The gentleman is Mr. O. W. Mac
larland, who is a writer on economic -Ã¼bjects
and Is not a free silver man. I would urge
that you write to him if possible. Further
more, obtain an interview with Professor E.
W. Bemis, who is at present in Chicago and
vh-. has some very interesting facts on tbo
subject. Very truly yours, E. A. Kosa.
DEAD AGAINST FUSION.
lorn Watson Prevents the Working of the
Scheme in Indiana.
INDIANAPOLIS, 15D., Sept 29.â
Thomas E. Watson, Populist candidate
for Vice-Preftident, put an end to the In
diana tusion scheme to-day. While the
committees of the two organizations were
in session at the Grand Hotel the follow
ing telegram was received in reply to a
telegram sent Watson earlier in the day:
Thompson, Oa., Sept. 29.
Charles Matthew*, Indianap 41$: I telegraphed
Ran.kin two days ago correcting report on
principal points. I am dead against fusion
with Pewall electors and I told Rankin so.
Where 1 submit to fusion I do under protest.
Thomas E. Watson.
Mr. Matthews held this telegram until
the Populist committee returned to the
English Hotel from their session with the
silver Democratic campaign committee.
At this Fossiou nothing definite had been
determined. The best that the Populist
committee would offer was a tusion wiih
h've Populists and ten Democratic electors,
declaring that it had no authority to
withdraw the Populist State ticket or any
Populist nominees for Congress. The tele
gram of Watson, when shown to the com
mittee, settled all possibility of any
further efforts in the direction of fusion, *

TANKS HOT USED FOE BALLAST.
One Little Act That May Endanger
International Contests in
the Future.
LONDON, Exa., Sept. 29.â Prior to leav
ing for New Yoric, Howard Gould, owner
of the yacht Niagara, under date of Sep
tember 16, has addressed an extended let
ter to the council of the Yacht Racing As
sociation, reviewing the action taken by it
anent the Niagara's water-tanks just after
the race of the Royal Thames Club,
May 22.
Mr. Gould specifies the size of the tanks,
quotes Dizon Kemp's letter for the asso
ciation, officially disclaiming that the
committee believed there was any truth
to the charge that the tanks were used for
shiftinc ballast, but requesting change in
piping, and. says this communication was
the first notice be had from the association
of "this extraordinary action, on tueir
part."
Mr. Gould's letter of Juno 20, in reply
thereto, is quoted emphatically denying
that the tanks were so used, and Mr.
Gould winds up his farewell in forceful
style, in which are the following words:
"Had I been communicated with prior
to this dhoourteous and unusual visit, I
would gladly have established the follow
ing facts:
"First, that the Niagara was measured
with her water-tanks empty; second,
that the water in the tanks had never been
used and was not used in any instance as
shifting ballast; and thirdly, that it was
impracticable to make advantageous the
tanks for such a purpose had I desired to
do so.
"I am surprised that I never received
any explanation of the course pursued in
boarding* the yacht without communicat
ing with me, although I characterized
such action as discourteous at the time.
"In the absence of such explanation or
disavowal on the part of the Yacht Racing
Association, I consider the course pursued
not only discourteous, but personally of
fensive and essentially destructive of the
amicable relations which lie at the very
foundation of the existence of interna
tional contests of this character."

BIG STORMS AND FLOODS
| Continued from first Past. J
partially blown down and the roofs were
lifted from two rows of operatives' cot
tages. No one was injured.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 29.â Chicago was
to-night drenched with rain, which began
falling early in the afternoon, and at
midnight continued to fall with a per
sistency that promises to cause much in
convenience to electric communication
with outside cities.
At the East a great storm is reported
over a territory extending from Pittsbure
to Washington and New YorK. The West
ern Union Telegraph Company reports the
loss of many wires east and south and in
consequence telegraphic business* was
greatly hampered and delayed, if not en
tirely abandoned in some districts.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Sept. 29. â Heavy
rainfall during the day and to-night has
wrought havoc with the telegraph lines
east of here, no communication having
been had with Washington since 11 o'clock
or with Harnsburg or Philadelphia since
midnight. East of the mountains the rain
is reported to have been accompanied by
high wind, to which the prostration of
telegraph lines is probably due. In the
absence of telegraph communication it is
almost impossible to obtain any informa
tion in regard to the damage done by the
storm. Severe floods are reported along
the southern border of this State and be
tween Cumberland, Md., and Graf ton, W,
Va., where bridges wÂ«re reported to have
been washed away, but no particulars are
obtainable.
EVERETT, Pa., Sept 29.â A heavy
flood followed the steady downpour to
night and the Baltimore and Ohio rail
road bridge was washed away. All tele
graphic lines are down. The lower part
of tha town is inundated. Traffic on the
Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain
Railroad is suspended because of sub
merged tracks. The water rushed down a
narrow gap and rose at an alarming rate.
Everett is directly east of Bedford, the
county seat oi Bedford County. All moun
tain streams are raging torrents. Their
narrow passes are choking the floods.
The loss to farmers and in villages along
the lower lands will be heavy.
BALTIMORE, Md., Sept. 29.â A severe
southeast hurricane struck this city at 11
o'clock to-night. Houses were nnroofed,
wires prostrated, windows smashed and
signboards blown from their fastenings.
The high wind forced the water in the
harbor up into the bed of the streets, and
almost the entire northern water front is
submerged. Several schooners that were
tied up at Pratt-street wharf broke from
their moorings and are resting in Pratt
street.
The lower floors of many warehouses
are flooded. The storm, accompanied by
a heavy downpour of rain, arrived at the
time of cosing of the theaters. Several
streetcar lines were rendered useless ana
many belated passengers were drenched
while seeking places of shelter or trans
erring to the more fortunate car lines.
The Western Union Telegraph Company

NEW YORK, N. V.. Sept. 29.â A furious
wind, accompanied by heavy rain, swept
tbis city to-night, and it is likely to con
tinue with unabated force for some hours
tomorrow. The storm was threatening
all day to-day, but the first intimation
that a hurricane was approaching came
in the shape of a dispatch from the Wash
ington Weather Bureau in the afternoon
to local Forecaster Dunn, informing him
to hoist storm signals on the weather
bureau tower and warn shipping that it
would be dangerous to leave port.
Incoming vessels coniinue to bring re
ports of storms at sea. All that arrived
to-day experienced gales, while several
suffered damage. Tne British steamer
Alodene, from Hamburg, ran into a strong
westerly gale September 23 and was
boarded by a huge sea. which swept the
whole lencth of the vessel.
It smashed the jolly-boit, badly dam
aged the lifeboat, shattered the engine
room skylight, broke the ventilators,
flooded the galleys and did minor damage
about the decks.
The Italian bark Harrington on Septem
ber 23 in tue Gulf stream was struck by a
ga'e from the north-northeast which
lasted fourteen hours. She lost some sails
and had others split.
The British schooner Arthur M. Gibson
arrived via Hell Gate. She reported losing
her forecopmast during a heavy north
northwest wind off Prince Edward Island.

THE STRIKE OF THE
TRAIN-DISPATCHERS
Continued from Tfnt .Page.'
like this is done it seems likely the strike
will prove a failure. The men are badly
organized and have little money.
OTTAWA, Ont., Sept. 29.â 1n conse
quence of the Canadian Pacific Railway
strike freight trains on that road are
stopped all along the Ottawa and Chalk
River divisions. Passenger trains are mov
ing, except the Winnipeg and Soo express.
Nothing definite can be learned regarding
the whereabouts of these trains.
WINNIPEG, Man., Sept. 29.â Although
there is a general strike of operators at
stations on the Canadian Pacific Railway,
these is little if any trouble here. All pas
senger trains were running as usual to
day, and the officials are taking all steps
necessary to till the places of the men who
have go.ne out. â¢ :
SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich., Sept. 29.â
Business en the "Soo" and the Canadian
Pacific railroads is at a standstill. The
strike of the Canadian Pacific telegraph
operators has raised havoc with all the
trains on tha Canadian Pacihc and the
passenger service on the "Soo" line.
The east bound limited, which arrived
at 10 o'clock this morning from Minne
apolis with 100 through passengers, is still
here, and may go East by way of Detroit.
The Minneapolis limited, due here at 4
o'clock this afternoon, has not been heard
from since last night.
PEORIA, 111.. Sept, 29.â At the head
quarters of the Order of Railway Teleg
raphers in this city it is stated that the
primary cause of the strike on the
Canadian Pacific is- that the officials un
dertook to force the train-dispatchers to
withdraw from the organization, threaten
ing discharge. This action was taken three
months ago.
No withdrawals have taken place nor
have any discharges resulted. Efforts
have been making meanwhile to adjust
the matter. It is denied at headquarters
that the order had not complied with the
rule of the company requiring com
plaints to be made to division head
quarters. It is stated that the grievance
was first presented to the division super
intendent and that it will be taken up to
Sir William Van Horn and possibly to the
directors, if. such action becomes neces
sary.
BOSTON, Mass., Bept. 29.â The Cana
dian Pacific Railway Company hired
seven men in this city to-day to take the
places of the men who have gone on
strike. The new hands left this evening
and will likely go to work to-morrow.
" GARFIELD IS DEAD."
That Was the Signal for the Telegraphers
to Quit Work.
VANCOJVER, B. C, Sept. 29.â The
strike of the railroad operators of tha
Canadian Pacific railway was a- complete
surprise to the officials of the Pacific divis
ion. The signal agreed upon was "Gar
field is dead," and on its recei-pt all opera
tors on the division excepting tw6, one a
dispatcher, went out. General .Superin
tendent Abbott states he was not aware
that any cause for complaint existed on
his division, and that the rir3t intimation
he had was a telecram from Assistant
General Manager Tail, Montreal, stating
that a committee, claiming to represent
the operators of the entire system, wished
to consult tha management on certain
grievances and present a schedule for
iuture observation. The general manager
referred the committee to the company's
rule which provides that all grievances on
the part of employes must first be brought
to the attention of divisional officials.
This not having heen done the manage
ment declined to bear the committee. It
is, however, asserted by the operators that
the men on the Western division did go to
their divisional officers first and were de
nied a hearing, and then went to Mon
treal, where they "were similarly treated.
At Montreal they were tola they were re
fused a bearing there because they had
not laid the matter before the officers of
their division. This, they explained, was
impossible because the divisional officers
would not listen to them.
Thus the matter stands and oniy inves
tigation can show which side is right. On
learning last evening that a strike was
contemplated. General -Superintendent
Abbott issued the following circular to the]
operators on bis division : .
"Reports circulated by a committee of
operators at Montreal intimate a possible
strike. Every movement of the committee
there has Deen ill-advised and unwar
ranted. Inasmuch as I have not had
placed before me any grievances, I shall
hear them through the proper channel, as
provided for in the rules and regulation's."
Irresponsible stories were started. to-day
to the effect that men were being sent out
to watch stations along the line, for fear
of their being set on tire, but such stories
were utterly groundless. The manage
ment has not the slightest apprehensjon
of anything of the kind occurring. To
day's east bound train was dispatched on
time, and unless complications arise the
passenger-train service will continue un
interrupted.
LIABLE TO BE FAR-HEACHING
Operators Complain of Home Very Un
derhand Treatment. ''
> SEATTLE, Wash.. Sept. 29. â Local
telegraphers who have in times past been
employed along the line of that railway
think the Canadian Pacific telegraphers',
strike is liable to be far-reacbing, possibly
resulting in a sympathetic s strike in the
United States. They say the discontent
of the Canadian Pacific telegraphers dates
as far back as six years, so that the recent
strike has been inaugurated with special
reference to tbe impenaine Presidential
election in this country. It is charged
that messages to Chief Pierson are being
"killed".or suppressed, and -that but for
that the strike would be more general
along the Canadian Pacific than is re
ported to-day. Members of the commit
tee, it is also asserted, appointed by tele
graph operators to wait upon Eastern
managers of the road and ask for a redress
of grievances, were responded to by being
dismissed from the service, this act, it is
alleged, having precipitated the strike.
Robert, Kerr, traffic manager of the
Canadian Pacific, telegraphed Locaf Agent
McGinnis to-aav that he did net believe
the strike would seriously interfere with
freight operations of the road. 9 â¢*

"CANTON, Ohio, S^pt -29. âThree of the
"five delegations scheduled to arrive here
tQ-day postponed their coming and the
two remaining ones did not ko to Major
McKiiiiey's house on account of the rain,
but were addressed In the Tabernacle. A
delegation of 500 Union veterans from the
State Soldiers' Home at Sandusky, with
10i) citizens of that town, came ai half- past
12 o'clock on a special train over the Bal
timore and Ohio Knilroad. Sergeant
Hopkins introduced the spokesman, L.
W. Hull, who addressed Mnjor alcKinley
at some length. Major McKinley's greet
ing from the old soldiers was ardent.
:I: I After the applause had subsided he spoke
. as follows:
My Comrades and Ladies and Gentlemen: I
wish 1 m iglit lie able to make fitting and suit- j
â able response to, the gracious words o( con
" Â»gratulation and good will which have been
spoken in your behalf by Serjeant Hopkins
and Mr. Hull. It is indeed a kind and gener
ous act o> comradeship that brings, on this
unpleasant day, the members of the Ohio
Soldiers' ana Sailors' Home of Sandusky to
this city to Day me a' Visit. My comrades, I
fuliy and heartily appreciate it. No body of
rrien who ha-ve visited me in the last few
months .have given me more pleasure or
: touched me mor.e deeply thanmyold comrades
of the 1 Saudusky Home. [Applause.]
â  . When you entered tbe :>ervice you were
yotinger lbnn you are now. Tbir:y-five years
ago most of you en Hate i and thirty-one years
ago most of you were mustered out of the ser
vice. You were then youi g and fresh With
the red wlue of early ma'nhooJ mantling your
cheeks. You are older now, but your heari
warms to the country and the old flag just as
it did in lStil. [Great appiatrse.] When you
entered the service you entered not for the
pittance that was paM you. you entered not
lor the glory or for personal nt>plause, but you
entered the service front ;ne purest and high-
est motive? of patriotism, tnai no harm should
come to our country. [App'ause.] Hint was
she motive of tbe oi<l soluier. Think waat
the great army of which you were a part was
willing to do. They were willing to give
health and Ftfefagth ; they were willing to die
that the American uniou nr.gnt be saved.
(Applause.]
So nigh to grrandf ur is our dost.
So Dear to God is man;
When duty wlmpcrs Lo. thon mtm,
The yoiuh repllcl, I can.
And so nearly two millions of men, when
duty cal'edi no matter what the exactions de
manded, were ready to answer to tne call of
.their cojiniry and detenU their country's free
rf 'ixif-tit utlons. . There are' now on the pension
. toll "of tne Government more men than were
â  list.cd in the War of the Revolution, the war
; erf 1812 and the wnr with Mexico. Within itbout
00,000 a.Â« ninny, men Hre on the pension rolls
of the United fkates to-day as were in all the
wars in -which this Government was en-
gaged from the 'Revolution to the Civil War.
I have always been iv favor of pensioning the
deservlrrg and cVsaDled soldiers of the Repub
lic and favoring their pensions, and I am now
in favor of havine tneir pensions paid in
money whose -value does not rest upon mere
fiat and which cannot be depreciated by fire.
[Great applause.] I am opposed to cutting
down tensions nr that way. I want the pen
wieners, who are iimon^ 'he largest creditors
of the Government, to-day, as I want all the
rreditoraof the Government, great or small,
"â¢'â¢â  to' be raid in the best money of the world â
dollars worth 100 cents every day and every-
â  where. [Applause.] 1 am glad to have you
* here to-day. I am glad to have, this large
'body .of veteran soldiers declare, as -your
; spokesman hasÂ»declared, that they are s'.ii in
lavor eft the country and the country's honor.
o [Applause.]
A color-bearer during the war, while in front
of the wivray, in his anxiety to do something
wit:-, two or three hundred men, marched in
. front, of- the line and toward the enemy's
works. When the general commanding in>m
the rear callcdt out: "Bring those colors back
to the line," the sergeant answered promptly,
with a voice of command that went bn< k to
the general qujciter than a miuie bail: "Bring
the line up* to the colors." [Luugbter and ap
plause.] We are carrying the same old colors
today that we carried thirty-five years, ago.
Boys, bring the line up to tl-e colors. [Great
applause.] .
My comrades, I thank you. I appreciate
this "call. Other delegations are corniEg. 1
beg that you convey to those df-ar old com-
rades who could not come with you on this in
. clement day my best wishes and warmest r- -
gardsandmy sincere prayers for their health
and contentmtnt; and I also beg that ycu cm
.' vey to that dearold c* mmander General Force
ray "sincere respects ai:a best wishes; and i
'* hope that yon will take back with you pleas
ant memories pi your visit to Canton. [Great
applause.]
The second and last delegation of the
day arrived an hour later. It was com
posed in the main of em i 'loves of th-
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in Northern
â¢ Indiana. With the delegation were 200
farmers and about sixty ladies. In re
* Bponae to an address by Judge Peniicld,
Major McKinley said: . â 
Â° lam glad* to welcome the farmer's and the
employes of the Baltimore and OhioÃailnad
Company and the citizens generally who have
â¢ honored me with this call this afternoon.
(Applause.] The farmers of (his country must
appreciate, and will appreciate. If they do not
already, that we cannot increase their market
or decrease . their competition, either at- norm
or abroad, by destroying the credit of the
â  country. . [Applause and cries of "Right,
â¦ right."].
That we cannot cut down the competition
which they have in India and Russia and the
Argentine Republic or Increase consumption
st home of their product? by cutting down
the value of the currency of the United States.
â¢The only way the farmers can be Deneflted is
through a larger consuming class. The mints
will not furnish the farmer with more con
sumer*. He has the mo>t profitable; market
for what reproduces at home and not abroad,
and what he wants to know is. how to inÃke
that market th" best. He cannot do it by cos
ing the nr.llh. [Cheers.] He cannot do it by
putting out the fires of our furnaces. [&â¢ -
neweit cheering.] Ho can ot d.Â» it by taking
business away from the great railroad line* of
the country. He can oniy improve the Ameri
can market by favoring a policy that will put
every man to wlork who lives beneath our flag
[eroiit applause], and keeping them at work nt j
living wages [renewed applause]; not the wage
scale of some other nation of the world, but
the American scaleâ the best in the world
[great applause); and you cannot improve tbat
market by des;roying the credit of ihe coun
try, for tin* credit of the country lies a t the
foundation of capital and prosperity. [Ap
p'ause.]
The farmer can no more increase the value
oi his wheat by diminishing the value of the
Atneriran dollar than he can increase the
quantity of his hay by diminishing the size of
t'.ie wngon on which he hauls it. [Tremendous
cheering and cries of "Good, good."] The
railroads of ;he country make busineÂ«s so
they consume 50,000,000 tons of coal a year.
Thr.t is what you engineers burn every twelve
months. What dots that do? [Cries ot "It
gives work."] Yes. it gives you employment
while you are burning it ; it gives the thou
sands of miners employment \vl\ile they are
digging it. That is the kind of a rolicy we
advocate. Let everybody help everybody else.
[Great applause, and cries ot "Hurrsih for Mc-
Kinley."] I see that the railroad train service
has four distinct servicesâ probably mere â
that of the engineers, firemen, the trainmen
an-1 the Order of Railroad Conductors, with
other organizations auxiliary thereto among
the switchmen and telegraphers. I am in
formed that each of these organizations has a
department ot insurance, mutual in its charac
ter and conducted and administered by men
of tneir respective organizations. Am 1 right
about this ? [Cries of "Yes."]
The highest tribute to their business capa
city and honesty is found In the fact that not
one dollar has been lost or squanden-d. The
trainmen have paid out nearly $3,500,000.
The fireme have paid out neariy-$4,000.009.
The conductors have pajd out insurance to
nearly $2,500,000. while the engineers, which
I believe is tbe oldest organization, haye paid
out nearly $6,000,000. The railroad men, too,
Â«re investors *nd stockholders in loan associa
tions and have savings in savings banks, or
they will h^ve. [Applause.] What a deep
interest, therefore, the railroad men have in
the rightful settlement of the money ques
tion. Not only are they interested in preserv
ing the integrity of their savings for their old
age or disqualification and their insurance to
â¢.heir families in caEe of accidentor death, but
thÂ«y are interested in their present and future
wages. I don't believe that the railroad men
of this country will ever consent to have their
wages cut in two or their insurance money
paid at the rate of 53 cents on ttic dollar.
â¢[Cries of -'No, no."] Nor will they be satisfied
to receive" their wages in anything but a cur
rency which shall be worth a full 100 cenU.
While they are talking Hbout the creditors of
this country they are auimndvsrting against
them. Who are the creditors of this country?
Tht-y arc the men who labor in this country.
[Tremendous cheering and cries of "That's
right,"] The greatest creditors of this country
to-day are the workingmen. Aside from
what is due them upon investments and
sa vines, their current wages make tl em
the largest creditor class in the United
tates. The employers of this country owe
their employes every thirtj- days, in good
times [cries of "Not now, though;" fol
owed by great laugnter], more than the
b-.nded indebtedness of the United Stat. s.
Nearly $500,000,000 is paid out annua'ly to
the rallraad employes alone. Does tbe rail
road employe propose to aid any party to
enact legislation which will cut his payroll
from 25 to 50 per ceu-t, in the name of a cheap
doiiar? [Loud pries of "No, no".] 1 have seen
it stated somewhere -that of the 750,000 rail
road employes in 'he'Uuited States about 75
per cent are vo'ers. 1 cannot be .mis
taken when I esoresa the belief that thes? men
will not cast .their votes in favor of r. debased
currency and the repudiation either of puolic
or private obligations:
I don't believe that the free coinage of the
si'.ver product of the United Platen, or the free
coinage of the snver product of the world with
the fiat of the Government of the United States
culd make n thing north only 53 ceuu worth
100 cents. [Great applause and enns of "No.
No."] Sucii a proposition is contradicted by
reason and experience, and opposed to com
m":i sense and the plain principles of ola
fashicrned honesty.
Now, mv fellow-countrymen, much as I
would be glad to tpeak to 700 longer, I must
not. Other delegations are coming. I thanW
you for this call and tor the assurances you
have given me of your support to the principles,
which, by the lavor of a great political party,
1 stand for at this moment. [Great applause.]
I am glad to know ihat the great State of
Indiflnu, the State of Harrison [great applause]
and Morton [renewed applause] wili stand this
year &â¢< it bes stood In all the years of the past,
for the couotry and the country's honor, and
for a policy that will give to the American
people the largest prosperity in their homes.
the greatest development vl their resources
and the highest credit of the Government.
[Great cheering.]
The story that Major McKinley is to
speak at Young-town the night before
election is Without foundation.
UNION GENERALS AT LINCOLN
Veteran* Receive a Great Oration in

LINCOLN, -Nebb., Sept. 29.â The com
ing of the Union generals who are making
a tour of Western fctates in the interest of
the Republican ticket was made the oc
casion of probahly the greatest political
demonstration ever held in Lincoin.
Elaborate preparations had been made,
and with perfect weather and vi-iting
delegations from nearly every section of
the Btate Republican enthusiasm ran
rampant."
The visiting veterans did not arrive
until evening, but the exercises began at
3 o'clock in "the afternoon witn a parade
through the principal streets of the ci'y to
the State Capiiol grounds, where ad
dresses were made by ex-Go\rernor Larra

An e-cort of cavalry and veterans met
the eenerals at 5:30 o'clock, and the State
Capiiol was agair. utilized for an informal
reception. To-night the city was a blnz"
of light with inarching everywhere and
â  . enty bands playing martial music.
The generals were distribute I at three
mi'eiing places. Generals Sickels and
Alger at trie Linking Theater, General
Stewart of Pennsylvania and ox- Senator
Manderson at the Funke Opera- house, and

Republican hoauquarters. Carriages were
in waiting and as soon as one speaker had
concluded he was ttiken to the oiher ball.
Overflow meeting? were also held at the
Counhou9e and Bohan's Hall.
The speeches were sh >rt bat earnest, de

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Sept. 29.â
While bound to this port from Victoria,
on its regular run from San Francisco
to the Sound, the steam-hip Umatilla,
commanded by Captain J. C. Hunter, met
with a mishap at 3:45 o'clock this morn
ing that forced It onto the soft shaley
oeach at Point Wilson, where it is stil>
stranded. The vessel was picking us way
cautiously across the Btraits in the murky
fog tbat bad prevailed sinca early in the
evening, when those aboard were startled
by a prating, rasping noise, accompanied
by a .slight careening of the steamship.
The Umatilla had struck a rock.
For only a moment was the steamship
on the sunken reef. The vessel rolled to
one side and soon slid from its perch, but
in the brief contact wit the rock a large
hole had been stove in the bottom, and
through this the water poured into the
hold.
All steam was put on to get the vessel
safe inside the bay. When just off Point
Wilson t ewate r which had been pouring
through the rent turned up into the tire
mom, threateninc to extinguish the fires.
When tliis fact was reported the nose of
tlie vessel was turned to the beach, which
it H'.ruck a moment later.
Unlike the condition of affairs which
usually exist under such circumstance,
the passengers, the officers ray, did not get
in the least excited, the calmness of Cap
tain Hunter and the orderly movements
of the crew assuring them that there w;t^
no danger. As soon as day broke thÂ«
officers offered to lower the boats and send
ashore all who micht de>i.-e lo go, but
the passengers wore confident in Captain
Hunter's assurance that ii was safe to re
main and declined to leave the vesaei.
The position the unfortunate vessel
occupies is exactly that of the Br.tish ship
Kilbrannan, which went a.-hore tbetc
duringa dense fojr some months ago, but
was later successfully floated. It is in no
imminent danger, except from north
west winds, which are uncommon at this
Beoson.
At 8 o'clock this morning the steamer
Angeles went to the Umatilla witn a scow,
and much of the ba . gagn and perisbubl
freight was Drought to Poit Townsend.
Several of the passengersaccompanied the
luggHge, and all are loud In their praise o:
the seamanship and nerve exhibited by
Captain Hunter and other otficers of the
vessel under eucb trying circumstances.
At noon a second trip was made by the
Angeles.
The steamship Walla Walla, which
sailed south to-day, took part of the crev
of the Uraatiila back to San Francisco.
From this fact it is evident thai the com
pany's representatives do not exj>ect to
?et the vessel afloat again at an early
date.
A correspondent who visited the scene
this evening found the nose of the Uma
tilla jabbed well in the sands of the beach.
The water had risen over the main deck
of the vessel aft. and the tables in the
dining-room were submerged. Those
aboard say that the water raised with sur
prising rapidity and that very soon after
the vessel was on the rock tlie firemen
were forced to come up out of the fire
rooms. The rock waÃ driven into the
vessel's plates just under the boilers and
it did not take Jong for the wate: ;o rise
up to the fW- boxes. It is impossible to
say jnst what will be done with the vtssel.
The hole is a bad one and there are some
who say that it means the last of the good
ship Umatilla.
The rock upon which the unfortunate
vessel struck is one of the many sub
merged menaces in the straits and it ie not
far from the notorious Sea Lion Rock,
ur on which the tug of that name stiuck
two years ago.
That vessel hÃd been plying the Bound
for years, and no one suspected the pres
ence of a rock at this place until one day
;ho tug run plump upon it. The exact
location is said to be immediately off the
Simms place on the straits.
Captain L'oyd came ashore late last
evening. He denies that the vessel went
on to the Sea Lion rock. The piaco
wdere she struck was an extension of a
rough, prbbly beach inside the buoy at
Riley's phice.
Tne Umat.lla at once commenced to
take water, and when the beach was
renched there wan eight feet of water in
the fireroom. Now the entire main deck
iÂ» submerged.
Diver A. O. Benjamin arrivd from
Seattle this aiternoon .:nd will investigate
the damage. Ei^ht men who were on
watch at the time the vessel struck claim
that the Point Wilson log signal was not
blowing. The keeper denies this and aays
it was blowing all night.
LANDED AT SEATTLE.

SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 29.â Thirty-two
of the Utuatilla's passengers. were brought
to this city to-night on the steamer
Rosalie. The master of the Rosalie, who
passed the Umatilla soon after the vessel
was beached, being en route from Victoria
to Port Townsend, . said one of the worst
fogs that he had ever experienced hung
over that portion of the Sound.

The Umatil.a is owned by tbe Oregon
Improvement Company, but for years nas
Ix-en under charter to Goodall, Perkins &
Co. It and the Walla Walla are sister
ships. When they first came to the coast
they were run as colliers between Seattle
and San Francisco. They were built by
Roach in 1881, and the work of transform
ing them from colliers into pos.">eneer
boats was done by the Union Iron Works.
An excellent job it was, and the Umatilla
wax one of the finest steamers that sailed
from this port. It is 310 feet long, 40 !eet
6 incnes wide and 3<"l feet deep. It is valued
at $350,000 and was partially insured iv
Eastern offices. There was 800 tons of
cargo in the hold, but the ctiances are that
a considerable portion of it wiil be saved.

Captain Hunter is well acquainted with
the locality in which he beached his ship.
Six years ago when be was master oi the
George W. Elder his vessel went ashore in
almost the same spot. It was in a fog,
and not being s-ure of his position became
lo an anchor. When the Elder swung
around with tbe tide, its stern struck and
the propeller was knocked out. It then
began to pound, and the "chain was paid
out until it landed on the beach. After
ward it was got off aud repaired at Esqui
malt. He is a very careful master, how
ever, and as the dispatches say that the
fog was heavy at the time the chanc< s are
he captain will be exonerated.
Point Wilson is well known to navi
gators, and many a disas er has occurred
there. About a year ago the British ship
Kilbrannon went ashore there and became
â¢ total, loss. Coasting vessels have also
met their fate on the same point, an ; it
has become a place marked on the chart
"to be kept clear oi" by all shipmasters.
Captain C. Miner Goodall of Goodall,
Perkins & Co. left for the scene of the
wreck last night. 'Is near as I can
gather," "said he, "the Umatilla went
ashore in a densa fog. So far we have re
ceived no definite news, but I do not think
tne vessel is in much danger. She will
Siave to be docked and repaired, but I
; tiiak that inside of a mon'.h she will be in
fan Francisco again. The lo*s will be
heavy, but I think the insurance will
cover it."
Captain Gooda'l will assume command
â¢in his arrival at Port TownsenU, and will
do all in his power to get ibe vessel off the
rocks.

DESERTED BY PARENTS
Now the Father Will Take the
Lad Back to a Life of
Luxury.
ROMANCE OF A DIVORCE COURT
A Case in Which a WeaUhy M chigan
Lumbeiman and His Wile Were
Principals.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 29.â There
was filed with the County Clerk t:.is morn
ing a modified decree of Judge Puter
baugh in the case of Kate A. Bradley vs.
E. W. Bradley, in which the custody of
the child, Harold, formerly awarded to the
mother, is now transferred to the care of
the father.
An interesting and romantic story is
uehind this little conrt item. On July 13
a divorce was granted to Kate A. Bradley
from F. W. Bradley, giving the custody
of the Bix-year-old boy, Harold, to th -
mother. Bradley is a memoer of the firm
of N. B. Bradley <fc Sons, lumbermen of
Bay City, Mich., and is reputed to be
worth over $1,000,000. The father. N. B.
Bradley, possesses a much larger fortune,
and the little boy, Harold, is heir to both.
Mrs. Bradley appeared at La Jolla last
December, where she rented a cottage
from Mrs. Mayes, and soon became highly
esteemed for her bright and charming
ways. Hsr little boy was with tier. It
became hinted about that the brilii&nt
Mrs. Bradley was iv California for the
t urpose of obtaining a divorce from her
husband, who was a very wicned man gen
erally.
About the Ist of February there alighted
from the train one day a handsome man â
Samuel A. Benton, lawyer, New York.
Mr. Benton immediately became very at
tentive to Mrs. Bradley, and in a few days
the neighbors began to whisper a little.
B it the shrewd woman c osed the moutn
of "Mrs. Grundy" by explaining that Mr.
Benton was an invalid, nere for his health,
a very old friend of the family and her at
torney >n her effort to obtain release from
her a'vful husband. Benton occupied the
cottage with Mrs. Bradley, but. as her
mother was always present, of course there
could be no harm in that.
After an idyiic life at La Jolla the New
Yorker suddenly disappeared. Mrs. Brad
ley's mother, who had come out from Bay
City, returned, 'leaving the pretty wotiul
le divorcee and her boy. Then," on July j
11, Mrs. Bradley told her landlady, Mrs.
Alaye9, tba; stie was about to marry Ben
ton, and would liKe to leave her boy with
tbe kind-hearted old lady. He would be
so troublesome on the honeymoon, she
said. Mrs. Mayes consented. Within two
days the divorce was granted. The mys
terious and handsome B-non appeared
promptly and went away with Mrs.
Bradley.
The next heard from the couple was a |
letter, dated at New YorK, to Mrs. Mayes,
inclosing a check for the child's expenses,
but saying nothing about sending for him.
Two months passed and Mrs. Mayes be
came worried. Finally she notified tbe
grandmother at Bay City of the situation,
requesting an immediate answer. She re
ceived in rtply a dispatch telling her to
await written instruction. In the mean
time she bad a!so received a letter from
Mr. Benton of New York to trie effect that
Mrs. Bradley-Benton in her new relation j
did not think it wise to assume the care of
a child, and had decided to let the father
have it, but that the father, who was lead-,
ing a gay bachelor's life in tne East, did
not feÂ«l the proper parental regard for his
child, and did not want it, either.
So ihe poor little ellow, who to save his
life cannot tell why he is causing so much j
trouble and who is the direct heir to mil- |
Huns, was in danger ol being turned ad: 'ft
on the world unless Mrs. Mayes consented
to care for him on her own responstbLity.
Now, however, through the efforts cf
Bradley's attorneys, the matter has been
adjusted, ami six-year-old Harold will
shortly be transported across the conti
nent.
Benton, who has played such a promi
nent part in the affair, is said to be a well
icnown criminal lawyer of New York City.

sealing northward along the coast of Japan
and not touching port alter leaving Hako
date until it. struck Attu, on this side.
The vessel was on the Japanese sidÂ« up to
the loth of July, and had bad weather for
sea'ing.
The highest catch in the sea was by the
schooners Favorite and Sapphire, about
800 to 900 each. The Diana and Casco had
the best lucfc on the Japanese coast, tak

schooner brings the news of the loss of
seven men from- the British cruiser
Satellite in Dutch Harbor on the
night of September 4 during one
of the worst storms that ever
struck tbe coast. The men went out in
one of the ship's boats to save another
smaller boat from the vessel containing
two men. Eight men, under command of
the first lieutenant, were in the boat tbat
left the Satellite. It was, as far us could
be learned, picked up bodily by tho wind
and overturned. One of the sailors swam
ashore; the others were not again seen.
The next morning their boat was seen
high and dry on the beach on the opposite
Â«ide from the town. The. two men whom
the lieutenant's crew started out to save
reached the land in safety.
Dutch Harbor is a land-locked bay not
far from Unalaska, and an ordinary storm
cannot affect shipping there. The storm
that struck the place on the evening of
the 4th o! September ia described by the
crew of the sealer Morrili as a hurricane.
The Satellite was anchored over a quarter
of a mile from shoro, while the Morrill
was tied against a wharf with eight lines
out. The vessels weie not disturbed, and
except for the loss of life no great damage
was done.
On the afternoon preceding the storm at
night two sailors from the Satellite went
out in a small boat fishing, and had not
returned when the gale broke over the
little harbor. No one doubted that the
big. well-made boats of the cutter would
ea*ily ride out the storm. Orders were
given to lower one and go in search of the
smaller boat. Soon after this boat was
lowered it went down, and the one man
who escaped swam to s ore, where he re
mained until the next morning. Then it
was learned that the two men out in the
smaller boat had made for shore when the
storm broke out and were safe.
The crew of the Morrill say Dutch Har
bor never presented such a grand sight as
it did that night. Wsves of great height
broke on the b^ach with the noise of heavy
guns, and the harbor becatre one mas.-* of
white spray and foam. It was impossible
to lower a boat after the storm got, to its
height.

J PORTLAND, Or, Sept. 20.â Five per
j sons are in jail here to-night as the result
iof Mrs. Jennie Melcher's alleged at
j tempt to shield her daughter's reputation
â  and to fasten the crime of infanticide upon
an innocent man. Ti.e chares against
them is manslaughter. They are Dr.
W. H. H. Palmer, a well-known physician;
Mrs. * Melcher, who palmed off her
daughter's dead infant as her own and al
: leged its death was due to an assault upon
I her by W. 11. Maple and his wife previous
Ito the infant's birth; the woman's
I daughter, who was arrested near S. afford,
j Clackamas County, to which place she
i was spirited; W. H. L. Melcher, the ad
i venturess' husband, and F. J. McMahon,
j a farmer of Oregon City, her first husband,

and was held for manslaughter to-day.
It is alleged that F. J. McMahon brought
i the daughter of Mrs. Melcher to a lodg
j ing-house, where the child was born, with
; Dr. Palmer as the attending physician.
; McMahon took the youne rnotlier away
i and hid her. Mrs. Melcher claimed the
I child as her own. Tne plot against Maple
was conceived and he and his wife would
have been charged with the babe's death
bad it not been for timely discoveries.
So well did Mrs. Meiciier pluy on
the credulity of a Coroner's jury that
spectators'- were melted to tears at her re
cital and there was talk of lynching the
Maples without the formality of a trial.

WILLIAM BOURNE'S LUCK
Shows No Bad Effects of the Fall
That Almost Caused His
Death.
OWNS TWO STRANGE CURIOS.
Portions of His Spinal Column Held
as Souvenirs of the
Accident
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Sept 29.â Genial
"Billy" Bourne, who made himself famous
the world over a few months ago by suffer
ing a broken neck and living to tell how the
sensation felt, is now summering in San
Rafael and is as well as he was before be
W. T. Bourne, Who Can Tell How
It Feels to Have One's Neck
Broken.
I fell over the balusters in the lodginc-
I house at the corner of Kearny and Bush
I streets.
In the collection of curios in his room
tbe most curious are two cervical verte
bire, white as ivory, fastened together by
j silver threads. They were once in
Bourne's own neck. It was found neces
sary to remove them while he was under
treittnient at the German Hospital.
Bourne relates the story of the accident
with a strong, hearty voice, and points to
the deep scar of the incision through
which the bones were taken with no ten
der touch. The only difference his friends
notice in bis appearance is a slight droop
of his bead forward. Formerly he stood
very erect.
"Following a seve/e attack of typhoid
pneumotfla," said he, "I became subject
to occasional convulsions closely resem
bling epileptic fits. These would take
me wholly without warning and would
j last for several minutes. The morning
when the accident occurred I had got
up to get the Sunday paper although 1
was feeling quite miserable at the time.
Somebody had taken the paper from the
door so I started out thinking I would get
one at a newsstand.
"A friend met me on the stairs and in
sisted on going with me, saying I looked
very ill. WuN we returned and were
walking along the hail of the second floor
I !eit one of these spasms coming over me
and pulled quickly away from my friend.
That i-; all I can remember until I came
to in bed and found the doctor over me. I
suffered no pain at all and tried to get up,
but he pushed me back teiltneme that my
neck was broken ami that I ought by good
rights to be (Jcnd. Mv head rolled around.
I had no control over it.
"My friend told me that wht>n I drew
away from aim I threw up my arms ar.d
fell over the railing, down* the stair
well, striking on my head on the hard
floor twenty odd feet below. Itis strange,
out since theu I have had no more epi
leptic fits."
Tue remarkable menoing process that
â \vjis used on the broken spinal column bu
already oeen described. It was a mooted
question for a while whether bourne
would regain bit old strength and vigor.
The sunlight of Sun Rafael lias completed
the miracle, and Bourne declares he is
stronger and more active than ever be
fore.
"Only," he adds, if you happen to be an
intimate friend and of robust build, i
please don't slarj my back with ail your
might. It don't hurt particularly, but
still you. might knocK another vertebra

ASCENDS QUILLAYUTE RIVER.
Captain Boyle Avoids Treacherous Rocks
by Utilizing Electric Lights
Unaer Water.
TACOMA, Wash.. Sept. 29.â Captain
Lawrence Doyle last week made a re
markable ascent of Quil.'ayute River, flow
ing from the Olympic Mountains into tbe
Pacific Ocean. He describes it as follows:
"There were six in our party. We pro
ceeded up the coast in the steamer Henry
Russell. Previous to last July, when I
made a similar trip, no steam craft had
ever entered Quillaynte River, because the
bed of the river Is rocky and dangerous to
navigate, especially at low tide. Captain
Johnson had no fear of the water, al
though it was necessary to enter the river
at night in order to catch tbe benefit of
tbe high tide. It was too dark to see the
rocks in the river, so a unique device was
arranged to throw light through the water
about the Dow of the craft. A projecting
iron hanger was made to run around the
bow lar down and on a level with the
keel. To this hanger was attached a
number of electric-lieht globes. Connec
tions being made with a dynamo on tne
boat an effulgence was thrown before the
craft. We then took lenres from a tele
scope and placed them at proper distances
in a long brass tube, which was thrust
into the water over the bow. Every ob
struction showed ud prominently and by
proceeding slowly we avoided all jagged
points and easily ascended the stream in
a few hours. The Indians came out in
canoes to greet us and as they gathered
around the steamer called it the 'big
smoke ship.' They were the most sur
prised lot of Indians I evÂ«r saw."
Captain Doyle intends patenting his de
vice and believes it can be made of general
use.
OVERDUE AT VICTORIA.
Search to Be Instituted by the Dominion
Officials for the Missing Chilean
Bark Lake Leman.
VICTORIA, B. C, Sept. 29.â Captain
James Gaudin, agent of tbe Marine and
Fisheries Department, has received a let
ter from Chilean Consul Morris at Van
couver requesting that the Government
steamer Quadra be dispatched on a cruise
in search of tbe rriesing Lake Leman, for
whose safety anxiety is daily intensified.
The vessel is a Chilean bark, which was
last heard of on Friday, the 18th inst.,
when it wjs run into by the Italian bark
Lazzaro, which arrived" at Everett from
P.rie a few days later. The Leman was
en route to Royal Roads from South
America in ballast, and a thick fog pre
vailed at the time of the collision.
The skipper of tiie Lazzaro, fearing that
something of a grave nature had hap
pened through the accident, sent a boat
to the Chilean vessel and offered assist
ance, which waa declined, Captain Buzzo
of the Lake Leman saying that though his
headgear had been carried away he would
have no difficulty in arriving at his des
tination. An hour later tbe vessels
parted, and although many vessels have
since been in from the cape not one has
beard or seen anything of the long-missing
craft.
Captain Gaudin proposed to remain no
longer in doubt, and would have dis
patched the Quadra yesterday in search
of the Leman had the Government
steamer been ready. To-morrow she is to
go to Nanaimo for coal, sufficient to last
her a month if needed.

Swan struck a submerged rock in Callao

Los Angeles, Cal., Sept 20. \
The work of tbe Southern California
Methodist Conference was concluded this
forenoon with the announcement of the
appointments of ministers for the suc
ceeding year. There were a number of
changes and transfers.
Thomas Stalker and W. A. Wright were
elected delegates to the National Anti-
Saloon League Convention in Washing
ton. Mrs. J. M. C. Depauw and Dr. W. A.
W T right were elected on the conference
board of deaconesses for three years, and
Rev. W. A. X nigh ten and Mrs. D. M.
Wells were appointed to fill vacancies
caused by the resignations of Mrs. A. E.
Houts of Santa Ana and Mrs. J. P. Wid
ney.
Lob Angeles was selected as the place
for the next annual conference.
Rev. Dr. Crawford of Pasadena was
chosen a fraternal delegate to the Congre
gational church, and L. M. Hartley to
present the greetings of tne conference to
the Women's Christian Temperance
Union of Southern California. Resolu
tions condemning tbe annual celebration
of la fiesta, and especially the street car
nival in the evening, were passed unani
mously. A paragraph in tbe pastoral ad
dress, read by Martin Hilbish, expressing
sympathy for the wage-earners of the
country because of the aggression of mon
opoly produced a very animated discus
sion, several prominent ministers favoring
a motion to strike it out. By a close vote
the motion was lost and tbe address ap
proved as read.

RIVERSIDE VS. SAN BERNARDINO.
The Legal Controversy Between the
Counties Comes to a Climax
at Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 29.â The
long-pending legal controversy between
Riverside and Pan Bernardino counties
over their accounts has finally come to
trial befora Superior Judge McKinley in
this city. The suit was brought by River
side County, which was dissatisfied with
the adjustment adopted by the commis
sioners appointed to strike a balance be
tween San Bernardino County and that
portion of its old territory that was set
apart and is now included in Riverside
County. The morning was consumed in
reading the lengthy pleadings in the
case.
Riverside County claims that the find
ings of the commissioners waa the result
of a conspiracy to defraud in tbe adjust
ment of the affairs of the two counties.
The commissioners found that at the
time t.e act creating Riverside County
I took effect (Marca. U, 1893), tuo total in-
I dehtpdn^ss of San Bernardino County was
|163,719 29 and the total value of the prop
erty of the county f213.5i6 98, which made
an exceÂ«s of property over liabilities of
$49.807 69. The assessed valuation of i?an
Bernardino was $36, 7*6 547 ana the as
sessed valuation in ttie territory set apart
was $3,382,572 Thi> commissioners de
cided upon 115,58682 as the amount to
which Kiverfuie County was entitled from
San Bernardino County.
Rivera de touiuy ciaiin-- that the fipures
were erroneous, asserting that Ban Brf
nardino's real deb: was oniy $40,139 42,
aod that the commissioners added 10 that
$163,719 29 for salaries and expenses of
county officers from March 11, 181>i}, to
January 1, 1595, which they had no busi
ness to do, claiming i: was not i'ldebteu
ne?s in the meaning of the act. Riverside
Cotin'.y further claims ti.at the property
estimate of San Bernardino Couiity was
erroneous and should be $4G5,4i7 20. As a
result of tbe manner in winch the plaintiff
figures it is claimed that Riverside County
is entitled to $13-027 09, instead of
$15,586 82, and the court is requested to so
adjudge.
In their answer to tfie complaint the
San Bernardino side alleges that far from
attempting to defraud Riverside CounÂ»y
many items were not included which
should have been by the commissioners,
and lhat in reality RiverÂ»idÂ»Â» County is
not entitled lo morÂ« than $10,000.
MURD ER IN CHINATOWN
A Mongolian Woman Shot and Killed by
One of Her Race.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 29.â A Chinese
woman named Ah Hoe Toy was shot and
killed by some Chinaman unknown to
night at 11:30 o'clock in a room that she
occupied in a building in Sixth-street,
Chinatown, near Jackson street. Three
shots were fired from a 40-caliber revolver,
and all of them took effect in the woman's
side, killing her instautly.
Chinamen who live in the neghborhood
beard the shots tired and admit that they
saw a man running away from the place
immediately afterward, but the witnesses
refuse to disclose who the man was.
The murdered woman is sairi to be the
wife of a Chinaman named Hong Wine
who left San Jose a week ago for Marys
ville to collect money owing to him there.
The motive for the crime is Ã¼bt known.
Body found in the Sacramento
CHICO. Cal., Sept. 29.â The body of
Doreatav Secenia, a Portuguese, who was
drowned off the Bteamer Dover in Sacra
mento River at MonroevilJe on January
28, 1896, was found half a mile above
Litch Landing yesterday morning by the
crew of the steamer Red Bluff.
SHOT THE WHOLE FAMILY
James Isaac Newton of Houston
Went Gunning at His
Father-in-Law.
Wounded Every One in the House,
Looking for a Wile Who Had
Left Him.
HOUSTON, Tex, Sept. 29.â Last night
James Isaac Newton walked into tbe home
of his fatt;er-in-law, Thomas L. Lyons,
witb a pistol in his bands and began
shooting. Lyons was shot in the bead,
receiving a flesh wound. Mrs. Thomas L.
Lyons, his wife, aged 60 years, was shot in
the right cheek, through the left arm and
through tbe left hand. Thomas W. Lyons,
j a son. aged 30, was shot through the left
side of the neck. The wounds of the son
and old lady will probably result fatally.
He shot three times at bis own son, 13
| years of age, but con* of the shots took
i effect. Mrs. Newton, his wife, was not
present Newton was disarmed by young
Lyons after the latter had been shot and
held until officers arrived.
Newton married a daughter of Thomas
Lyons fifteen years ago. The marriage
did not prove to be a happy one. Newton
treated bis wife badly, and she stood it
until last July, when she decided that she
could not bear it any longer and left him.
Newton became greatly enraged when
he found what his wife had done, and fre
quently threatened that he would have his
revenge. Last week he kidnaped iiis nine
year-old daughter, who had gone with her
mother. Afier securing possession of the
child, he demanded the surrender of her
clothes, but Mrs. Newton refused to give
them up. On that occasion he went to the
house, threatening to clear out tne family,
but thought better of it.
STANDS BY DR. BROWN.
The Dubuque Congregational Conference.
Decides to Admit the Pastor as a
Member of Its Body.
DUBUQUE, lowa, Sept 29.â At its an
nual meeting at Strawberry Point to-day,
the Dnbuque district conference of the
Congregational churches took up the
request of the Bay Conference
of San Francisco that the ac
tion of tbe Dubuque body in condemn
ing Californians for expelling Rev. C. O.
Brown, after he had been acquitted by the
church trial on charges of immoral con
duct witb Miss Overman, be rescinded.
The matter was discussed and tbe con
ference by a decisive majority reaffirmed
its position in the case, not only refusing
to rescind its resolutions, as requested by
the Bay Conference, but deciding to re
ceive Dr. Brown into its fellowship.
This action was in direct line with that
taken by the churcn in this city last week.
It is predicted that the case will be taken
to the highest tribunal in the church by
the Californians, but the Dubuque confer
ence is determined to maintain its posi
tion in Brown's behalf to the end.
SEW XOHI'EUO-BUATS.
One of the Swiftest to Be Built by the
Union Iron Works. '
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 29.â The
Bath Iron Worts of Maine will build two
of the 30-knot torpedo-boats and the
Union Iron Works of San Francisco has
the contract for the remaining one; Wolff
& wicker of Portland, Or., two 22^-knot
boats and one of the little 22-knot boats
Herreshoff will have three, Columbian
Iron works of Baltimore two and Hillman
Bros, of Philadelphia one. This is the
decision finally reached by Cnief Con
structor Hichborn and Engineer-in-Chief
Melville, to whom the numerous and com
plicated bids opened September 11 were
referred.
The two bureaus under these officers
have devoted their energies unremittingly
for the past two weets to canvassing the
relative merits of the designs offered by
tbe various competitors for the work and
no doubt is felt that their recommenda
tions will be precisely followed in award
ing the contracts.
The policy pursued has been to obtain
boata as large as possible under tbe pro
posals and lo secure aa many as the appro
priation of |1,300,000 would permit The
official report of Commodores Hichborn
and Melville to the Secretary o' the
Navy will probably reach Acting Secretary
McAdoo some time to-morrow. He may
conclude to leave hnal action to Secretary
Herbert, who is expected from Europe
next Saturday. Under the law the cX
tracts must be signed on or before Thurs
clay, Oct. 8.

AMERICA MAY PEOTECT MEN.
On- This Continent, by Right Use of
the Ballot, the Worker May
Maintain Freedom.
>~o argument that can be made.no oration
that can be delivered, can set so plainly
before the American workingman the dan
ger that threatens as the accompanying
map sets it forth. In what a small part of
the earth is labor well regarded and well
paid !â  In what a vast proportion of the
earth is labor still unorganized, poorly paid
and without consideration in the affairs
of government! In only a lew of the
many countries of the world have the
people discovered themselves, learned
t heir own power and been accorded the
right to walk erect in tne dignity of con
scious manhood. in this America leads
the world, has 'led the world and must
continue to lead the world if the worKing
world is to be led out of bondage to
hereditary" weal th, hereditary aristocracy
and hereditary right to rule those who work
for others to enjoy. In America alone are
there no classes, no social barriers which
doom the children of toil to lowly stations
in life*, and in America alone are all men
accorded equahty oi opportunity to work
out .their own careers as ambition and
capacity may equip them. In all the rest
â  bi the world the children of toil are more
or less debarred from advancement by
: law, by custom, by hereditary entailment
of wealth or oy power of royalty. Look at
- the black border line which, in the above
map, surrounds tbe United States, with its
liberty ofindividul enterprise, its freeuom
from the tyranny of royalty and its well
paid labor, and then remember that that
black border line on the map represents
no Chinese wall which required
years in building and which it would
take years to tear away, but only an
imaginary line, a line dec.ared by law
which any Congress can repeal, any ad
verse majority brush away. Look at that
line, look at the vast surrounding world
, of low wages, pauper wages and ceaseless
labor of millions practically without
wages-"ali striving to Dreak tnis barrier
downâ and then ask yourself if American
labor is not in jeopardy, if the warning
here given to American workingnien be
in fact au alarmist scare raised for politi
cal purposes or a Bolemu and candid
declaration of an impending peril.
It will be noticed that in toe above map
the oceans are foreshortened, narrowed
down until the earth's surface is no
longer three-fourths water and one-fourth
land, but the oceans are not reduced to a
. narrower limit on the map than steam
navigation has- reduced therm, practical! v,
in the commerce of the world. San Fraii
â  else* is seventeen to nineteen days from
Yokohama^ twenty-five to twenty-eight
days from Hongkong, forty to forty-rive
; days from Calcutta, twenty-four days from
Sytiney, and it costs no more to ship a ton
of freight from either of these places to
San Francisco than from San Francisco
by rail to Fn-srio or Bakersfield. A ton of
flour is carried from San Francisco to
Hongkong for $2 in gold, a less rate than
is charged for hauling a ton of wheat
from Tuiare to Port Costa, and the average
merchandise rate between San Francisco
and i'oJJohama or Hongkong is $10 per
. ton or per each forty cuoic leet of space
in the ship. On a bolt of muslin,
a silk dress pattern or a pair of shoes such
a freight rate would scarcely figure into
the retail cost of the article. It would
'amount to no more than tbedrayage from
wharf to store, and all water rates be
tween the above points and New York
are "not greater than to BaD Francisco,
having been quoted as low as 40 shillings
per ton. With sailing vessels a much
lower rate than above quoted can be se
cured, and for all practical purposes these
Asiastic points are as near to San Fran
discb as are New York, Philadelphia or
Boston. Therefore we must not rest in
in any fancied security from competition
with Asiatic cheap labor that is baÂ»e'". on
distance and cost of transportation.
Steam navigation has well-nigh annihi
lated distance and reduced cost of freight
to Â» mere bagatelle in the selling price of
any article of apparel or household utility.
Six hundred million workers I That
is the number of tireless toilers Asia
= has to offer to the industrial world.
The matter is beyond comprehension. In
the United States it is estimated that
there are now fifteen millions of people
â who work for wages. To keep these em
ployed and contented taxes â overtaxes â
tile best statesmanship oi our time; but
.what is this handful to the teeming
masses of Japan, China, Indo-Cbina,
India, Siberia and the Malaysian penin
sula and tbe archipelago, who have not
yet discovered themselves or learned that
there is anything in this world to be de
sired beyond a full stomach and a warmly
c.ad body. Not only are the men of these
â  countries tiretess workers, but the women
also and the little children must work or
starve, and lowly indeed is their standard
of living. It is the duty of our better
western civilization to lift out of the mire
of ignorance and superstition, of ceaseless
toil and pitiless deprivation, this vast,
hulking horde of depressed humanity,
teaching it self-respect, the power of or
punization and the rights of men; but it is
no part of the duty of western civilization
to permit itself to be 'dragged down to the
sodden level of an oriental scale of civili
zation, standard of living and of wages.
How to lift the one up and not drag the
other down is to be the supreme prob
leja of all the coming age, if not
tbe supreme problem of all tbe
age<Â«. To cry a warning to American
workingmen of the impending dancer
is not to perform the function of an alarm
ist fbr political effect, bnt is to confer a
needful service at an opportune time. The
only way to ward off tbe danger of de
erading American labor through Asiatic
competition is to face it at the outset.
Averting tbe eyes from it will not frighten
it away.
Japan has 40,000,000 people. It has am
bition. The fires of nationalism burn
fiercely in every Japanese breast and race
pride glows as fiercely as the fires of na
tionalism barn. Japan has an area con
siderably in excess of that of Great Britain,
a more eqnable climate, abundant water
power, great mineral wealth and good
steam coal that can be delivered to con
sumers for less than $1 per ton. While
not fertile in invention tbe Japanese peo
ple excel in imitation, and as deft weavers
and spinners have been developed in
Japan in ten years as were developed in
Manchester, England, in three gener
ations. Japan has no international patent
laws with other nations, and when she
finds a machine that suits her she buy*
one and makes others just like it, and
will soon be equipped with all the modern
appliances for manufacture and produc
tion. Japan has great resources for the
production of many raw materials for
manufacture, and her situation is admir
able for the importation of raw cotton
from India and China and raw wool from
Australia, and she is filled with an am
bition to become the Great Britain of the
Orient. Her schools are industrial and
military in character, and Japan now oc
cupies that position in the scale of civil
ization where the rights and liberties of
the individual are mercilessly sacrificed
for the good of the state. "The ppople"
of Japan have not yet discovered them
selves, and are not likely to make the dis
covery for a long time to come.
In 1883 Japan built her first modern cot
ton mills, two of them, and now she has
more than sixty cotton mills, with 1,250.000
spindles. Since the close of the war witn
China, according to a statement recently
published by K. P. Porter, late Superin
tendent of the Eleventh United States
Census, who has just visited Japan and
made a close study of its institutions,
among others the following new industries
have been established:
Forty-nine cotton mills, with a capital
of $29,582,000.
Twenty-four silk mills, with a capital of
$10,295,000.
Nineteen weaving factories, with a capi
tal of $9,425,000.
Twenty- two mining and metallurgic
companies, with a capital of $8,150,000.
Fifteen electrical works, with a capital
of $11,620,000.
Fifty-eight other industries, with a com
bined capital of $17,489,000.
The same authority goes on to say:
''In the magnificently equipped cotton
spinning and weaving factories, in the
machine-shops of Japan, in paper mills, in
some of the larger silk factories, in clock
and watch factories, I have seen the most
modern English, German and American
machinery, and forces of men and women
as thoroughly organized for labor and as
fully equipped as any on earth."
From the same authority the following
additional facts are obtained:
In some of the silk districts I found
modern machinery and regularly equipped
mills employing 500 to 1000 hands.
In the Fukai district the first si k was
manufactured in 1888 and to 'he aggregate
value of $50,000. During 1895 this same
district produced silt to the value of
$6,076,220.
Tbe sum of $935 would have .bought all
tbe floor matting exported from Japan
during 1885- During 1895 the exports
amounted to $3,461,365.
The exports and imports together ag
gregated $77,300,000 for Japan for 1885.
For 1895 they amounted to $296000,000.
In audition to these great factories are
thousands upon thousands of old fash
ioned wheels and looms running within
hearing distance of the great modern fac
tories, for the Japanese weaver and
spinner mast work if he would eat, albeit
with appliances that are a thousand years
old. .
The phenomenal development of indus
trial Japan is further exemplified by the
'following" comparative items of export,
also prepared by R. P. Porter:
1885. 1895.

'The foregoing , are only a few of many
instances of increased production and ex
port which are not given for want of space,
but the lesson derived from this will be
instructive.
When we come to investigate the scale
of Mages paid in Japan ana the condition
of Japanese labor it becomes perfectly
apparent why Japan is progressing indus
trially and pouring an ever-increasing
product into the lan of the world. Her
labor is so cheap and so tireless that no
other nation in the world, unless it be
China, can compete with her.
The factories of Japan run night and
day and each shift works twelve hours at
a stretch, the day shift of one week being
the night shift of the next, and many
mills do not stop at all for more than one
or two days in the month.
From the United States consular re
ports the following scale of. wages in dif
ferent lines are found to be "paid in Japan.
The figures are given in silver, which has
about half the real value of American
money that is here given:
Bricklayers, per week $2 04
Hodcarriers, per week 1 14
Masons, per week 2 18
Tenders, per week 1 14
Plastarert, per week â 1 56
Cart Piiters, per week , 1 56
Blacksmiths, per week 1 85
Bakers, par week 1 66
Draymen and teamsters, per week 1 50
Tailors on naive clothes, per week 1 70
Tailors on foreigu cloihts, per week 2 95
stevedores, per week a 18
Printers, per week 175
Common laborers and porters, per week. .,.. 1 14
Brass founders, per week. 3 00
Common laborers receive the equivalent
of 10 cents per day in American money.
Skilled mechanics receive the equivalent,
of 18 cents per day in American money.
X'ot the arduous labor of the factories
women are paid 6 to 16 sens per day in
silver and men get \2% to 25 sens, and it
takes 180 sens to be worth as much as an
American dollar. A Government rep Tt
gives the number of male spinners for 1894
at 8129, who received an average danv
wage of 17.1 sens. There were 26,929 female
spinners, who received an average daily
wage of 8.9 sens.
Speaking of the condition of Japanese
labor, Mr. Fusataro Takano, a cultured
Japan- se, writes of bis own country to
Guntons Magazine for August, 1896, as
follows:
"It is an indisputable fact that hereto
fore the welfare of the working people of
Japan has nevjer entered into the consid
eration of national affairs.
"Any upward tendency of wages will be
considered as detrimental to national pros
perity and will be opposed as Â«uch.
"Ten per cent of the male spinners and
23 per cent of the lemale spinners are chil
dren under 15 years of age.
"While production was increasing ten
fold and the demand for labor five fold the
condition of spinners presents nd trace of
improvement. On the other hand, the
cost of rice, sugar, tea and fuel shows an
advance of 10 to 20 per cent during the
time.
"Low wages, long working hours, child
labor, black list â such are the conditions
existing in the cotton spinning industry
in Japan and similar conditions are con
fronting the workers in other trades which
are running under the modern system of
industry.
"The workers are in a dazed condition
and diffusion of Western civilization is
limited to the higher classes.
"The appalling condition of the factory
hands is still further aggravated by the
existence of an agreement made by the
mill owners throughout the country that
the wages of spinners will not be raised
unless so agreed unanimously.
"Added to this the spinners are all under
police supervision by which their employ
ers arf amply protected from every pos-
Bible attempt on the part of the spinners
to right their grievances."
This, then, is the condition of millions
of laborers in Japan with whom the Popo
cratic aggregation wish to have American
laborers compete in the home market un
der a low-tariff policy.
China and her dependencies have a com
bined area equal to that of the United
States and Mexico and a population more
than six times as great. If to this there
be added adjacent land's ander European
control but settled by Mongolians, with
Korea, we have lands of unsurpassed re

sources settled by a working population
equal to tbat of all Europe and North
America. Four hundred millions of tire
less toilers with unequaled habits of thrift
and economy, imitative and not wanting
in skill, waiting to be set to work by
European and American capital and en
terprise 1 Tbat is the competition which
confronts American labor!
China is conservative. China would be
glad to let the world alone if the world
would let her alone, but the world will
not. Japan waged war against China for
no other reason than to compel her to
come out from her hermitage and open
commercial relations with her more enter
prising neighbor. England, France and
Russia are encroaching upon her on all
sides for the same avowed purpose. The
whoie western world is bent on forcing
upon China all the inventions and instru
mentalities wherewith to enter upon a
never-ending and destructive competition
with the western world itself. To pre
serve herself from utter dismemberment
and annihilation China has tot to build
railroads all through her interior and
open all her waterways to steam naviga
tion. The great Li Hung Chang has been
around the world to study the world and
now goes home to throw his immense in
fluence and wealth upon the side of in
ternal development. Prince Li is not
ignorant of the resistless power which
China's horde of cheap labor gives her â a
labor so cheap and a standard of living so
low that an earning capacity of 5 shillings
a month will support" a Chinese and bis
family. In the course of an interview in
New York he said:
"You should repeal the Geary law.
Cheap labor is a most desirable thing
within itself because it will enable you to
compete in the markets of the world with
the products of the cheap labor of Europe.
Cheaper labor means cheaper commodi
ties and better commodities at lower
prices."
That is the sort of doctrine that obtains
in a country such as China and in all of
Asia, where the Government is everything
and the individual is nothing. It is the
commercial spirit as against the industrial
spirit. It is the policy of low tariff and
"flying your flag in the markets of the
world" carried to its legitimate con
clusion. But it never was* the policy ot
the Republican party of America, which
believes that if the individual be cared for
well the Government cannot fare ill.
India is another rejuvenated nation of
toilers. It has an area about two-thirds as
great as that of the United States and a
population four times as large, and it has
an inexhaustible supply of cheap labor.
Three-fourths of the people of Hindostan
derive their support Jrora the land, but
progress in handicrafts is making and an
era of grea.t industrial development is at
hand.
Neither Europe nor America can with
stand,"on equal footing, the com petition of
India in any line of production under
. taken. Sixty per cent of the jute manu
facturing machinery of Dundee, Scotland,
the very life of that city, has been hushed
by Indian competition, and the doom of
the rest of it is likewise sealed.
Common laborers in railroad building in
India receive 6 cents a day in wage? as
valued in American money. Lathe ma
chinists get 24 to 27 cents a day, and other
wages rantre between tnese two extremes.
The standard of living is low and only the
coarsest and # cheapest products are con
sumed by the Hindoo.
After generations of floundering in the
mire of unthrift, swept by floods and de
voured by Jiimine, British administration
of Indian affairs has impounded the sur
plus waters, irrigated the arid wastes, built
20.000 miles of railroad from interior to
coast, and otherwise fully equipped India
to enter the industrial "lists in competi
tion with the better paid labor of the
Western world. Having been lifted up
the Hindoos are now prepared to pull their
benefactors down, and are doing it.
We have heard much from the Demo
j cratic party of tbe advantages to be gained
by access to the "markets of the world,"
by having the "stars and stripes flying in
every sea." Let us see what this has
amounted to so far.
Take Japan. During 1894 there was ex
ported from the United States to Japan
goods to the value of 110,982,558, but we
'â  bought from Japan goods to the value of
: 14^523.557.
During 1895 our exports to Japan
; amounted to *9,27U,360 and our imports
' from Japan amounted to $54,028,930.
We buy from Japan 40 per cent of all
she has to sell to the rest of the world.
, We seii to Japan 9 per cent of all that she
L buys of the world. She takes our millions
and sends them to Europe to buy with
tlfem what she wants, because she can buy
there cheaper than here, and she can buy
there cheaper than here because Europe
can manufacture cheaper than America
can, and Europe can manufacture cheaper
than America can because labor is cheaper,
and for no other reason on earth.
Take India. During 1895 we sold to
j British India goods to the value of $2,853,-
Ml. but wo huught of the same countries
j t;oods to the value of $21,266,013. During
I 1894 the difference was not quite so great,
the balance of trade against us being only
$10,500,558, but for the year 1893 the bal
ance acninst us was far greater, being
j $22,815,794, and it usually ranges between
fifteen and twenty millions a year.
Take China. During 1895 we sold to
that country goods to the value of $3,603,
-840, but we bouglii goods to the value of
$20,545,829. During 1894 the balance
against us in our trade with China
amounted to $11,262,602, during 1893 the
balance against us wad $16,736,078, and the
adverse -balance in our trade with China
ranges between these figures and has done
so for years.
The "fact is that the United States can
not compete with Europe in supplying
the Orient with the commodities because
our wages are higher and our standard of
livintr more excellent, and the Orient can-
I not buy greatly from any country because
I of its low standard of living and degraded
I standard of wages and production does
not furnish the means to buy with. For
instance, the entire production of British
India for a whole year, all the wealth
taken out of the soil, the mines, the sea,
and manufactured by artisans does not
exceed $10 for each man, woman and child
in that country. How can such a poverty
stiicken people buy of the world or sell to
the world? We buy of them because ye
are rich and able to buy. They sell to us
because they are too poor to consume the
things they produce and ought to keep for
home consumption. And yet tariff re
formers never cease to boast of the fabu
lous wealth awaiting development of
American traffic with the Orient!
Those who view the question of Orien
tal competition as set forth in these pages
are not oblivious of the fact that a certain
school of doctrinaires and tariff reform
ers (men like Bryan, who declare the pro
tective idea t{ie "most pernicious political
principle that ever cursed the country")
are inclined to pooh-pooh at the danger of
Asiatic competition with the better-paid
labor of Europe and America. Want of
space forbids an adequate enumeration
and consideration of the contentions of
these sanguine and satisfied exponents of
the doctrine of our industrial invulnera
bility, but a few lines will be devoted to
the more important among them.
Briefly, it is claimed by these persons
that "by virtue of perfected machinery
the industrial efficiency of Western na
tions is incomparably greater than that of
the Orient."
For answer to which it is sufficient to
say that Western industrial enterprise is
already finding its most inviting field in
equipping Asiatic nations with all our
best-perfected mechanical appliances, and
when at length this has been done Asia
will have equal mechanical appliances
with us plus limitless cheap labor, which
will matte the industrial efficiency of the
Far East as much greater than that of the
West as her labor is on a more cheap and
abundant a scale.
"That Asiatic nation? are wanting in ad
ministrative ability and capital, and that
without these their cheap labor cannot be
made available."
The fluidity of capital is a fact. It seeks
the place of best employment as unerr
ingly as water seeks its level. It knows
no country or national allegiance. Hith
erto capital has flown to America because
America has been honest, but let Bryan
ism and repudiation settle with a 53-cent
dollar debts that were created by the bor
rowing of a gold dollar, and our National
dishonor will not only drive out foreign
capital invested here, but it will banish
our own capital. Money will go where an
honest accounting for it can be compelled
by the stout arm of army and navy, and
with it will go the administrative ability
requisite for its employment and for the
mobilization and organization ot the
cheap labor of the world. Besides, the
fact of the existence in San Francisco of
factories employing white bosses and
white girls by the score, yet owned and
managed by Chinese, together with the
fact that the products of hundreds of
orchards are handled by white help and
Chinese employers in this State, shows
that the Asiatic is not so devoid of ad
ministrative ability as these theorists
would have us bedeve.
It is contended that, inasmuch as "men
produce that they may aell and buy, that
they may consume," as the Asiatics be
come greater producers consumption wil 1
increase correspondingly, and they will
buy as much as they sell.
It may be admitted that in the fullness
of time all men oil the earth will be equal,
that equal wages for equal work will be
the condition of the earth from pole to
pole and zone to zone, but when? It is
not this final consummation which
threatens American labor with degrada
tion. If all the world paid American
wages, America could trade free with all
the world. It is the process of readjust
ment that hurts. Look again at the ac
companying map and ask yourself, gentle
reader, how the United Stat s, so small
compared to the habitable globe, is to
maintain the dignity of its labor and the
generous recompense of its wages until
the poorly paid labor of Europe, the
pauper labor of Asia, of Africa, and of all
the rest of the globe, has been lifted to the
American standard, and when you have
done this you will have propounded the
crucial question of the coming age.
Finally, the contention is made that
the wage-earners of Asia, like those of
Europe and America, will organize trade
guilds and through power of organization
advance their wages as their productive
rower, enhanced W>y the adoption of
Western machinery, becomes enhanced.
We may grant this and then offset the
concession by asking: When? What will
have taken place meantime? As a gifted
advocate of the above contention has said,
"a half-century in the history of nations
U a period as recent as the yesterday of an
individual life." A half-century has been
scarcely more than a yesterday in the
period which has been required to elevate
American and English labor to its present
estate, but it might be quite time enough
to undo all thai organized labor has ac
complished for itself, and wouid be if sub
jected to unrestricted competition with
the limitless pauper iabor of Asia. A
building that it took a year to build was
burnt in an hour. The golden age of
English labor was from 1401 to 1525, but
during the next century it sank to a con
dition of utter helplessness. Three cen
turies o' incessant struggle ensued before
the right of organization in self-defense
and seli-help was conceded by the laws of
civilized countries, so easil}' is the dignity
of labor lost and so hard is it regained.
But what of the rights of labor in Asia?
In no one of those countries have the la
boring classes any rights, as we under
stand them, which the laws are bound to
respect. The guilds already formed are
chiefly employers' guilds, not guilds of
laborers. There are no middle classes to
whose sense of justice tne down-trodden
laborers can appeal. Society is divided
into two classes â those who make the laws
and those whose only concern is to obey
the laws which others made. From this
status to that of American labor, which
makes the Jaws as well as obeys them, is
a long and wearisome journey in any
country and by any people, and the labor*
ing classes of Asia have not started upon
that journey yet.
Tne contentions of the advocates of low
tariff are idle. The danger from Asiatic
competition is real and imminent. Al
ready it is being felt in many channels of
trade and those who read the signs of the
tirueH aright know that what has alreaih
taken place is only the beginning of a
mighty struggle with the powers of dark
ness and that t. c beginning of the end of
it is yet a long way off. How shall the
brown man be lifted out of the mire and
the white man be not drawn in? That is
to be the crucial question of the corning
age and, perhaps, of all the ages of human
history.
The only means of safeguarding Ameri
can labor against the consequences of com
petition with Asiatic hordes is to stand by
the American system of protection to
home industries and stand for the main
tenance of National honor. To both of
these high purposes the Republican party
and its candidates stand pledged in the
most solemn manner, and behind these
pledges, as a further guaranty of good
faith, is an unblemished party and per
sonal record of persistent championship
of them. What this party, its leaders and
its followers cannot do for the preserva
tion and elevation of American labor can
not and will not be done. Labor has no
other safeguard, no other puissant power
to deliver it from the body of this death.
Arrayed against this great National
party, its candidates and its cause there is
marshaled a nondescript aggregation of
political forces which refuses classification
and analyzatlon aod is mainly concerned
foÂ»" office. In the yesterday of its history
it stood for one thing, in its to-morrow it
will stand for heaven knows what, but to
day it does stand for putting the United
States on an Oriental monetary basis and
for the reduction of the standard of Amer
ican wages and living to. another stand
ard which will be European, if not Asiatic,
in its character. Its professions may point
otherwise, but its principles, put into op
eration, will inevitably tend that way. Its
standard-bearer, Mr. Bryan, is an uncom
promising champion of the British theory
of free trade, and this theory, put into
practical operation, would assuredly ac
complish tbe undoing of American labor.
Mr. Bryan is likewise an uncompromising
champion of free silver, and what with a
European scale of wages and an Asiatic
standard of monetary payment the degra
aation of American labor wouid be com
plete.
Workingmen of California, your duty in
this contest is too plain to need to be
pointed out. You have but to be true to
your own interests in order to best serve
your country and your party. Sophists
may try to bewilder you and demagogues
may try to deceive you, but if you have
read these pages thoughtfully you know
the danger which threatens and you know
of the only safeguard that is left. Your
destiny is therefore in your own bands,
and "as you make your bed so shall you
lie in it." ___________^_

WHERE WOOL IS
NOT PROTECTED
Chief Justice Smith Tells
of Want in New
Mexico.
He Says There Are to Be Found
the Poorest People and, Per
force, the Idlest.
HAEDLY WANT TO BE A STATE
Low Prices Prevail, Crops Require
Irrigation and There Is No
Market for Products.
Chief Justice Thomas Smith of New
Mexico is at the Occidental, accompanied
by Mrs. Smith and Miss Qaines of Vir
ginia. The Chief Justice has had a mo
mentous career. He is from Virginia, and
hi.- father and three brothers at one time
in the fifties resided in California. When
the war broke out the now Chief Justice
enlisted as a private in the Army of
Northern Virginia. He served all through
the war, and before its close had been
made brigadier-general.
President Cleveland appointed him
Chief Justice Thomas Smith of New
Mexico*
United States District Attorney of New
Mexico during his first term, and he
served four years. Then he appointed
him Chief Justice, which he has been now
for three years. He was not an applicant
for either office.
Chief Justice Smith is a very young
looking man to have been through the
war and attained such eminence. He
does appear now to be over about 40 years
of age.
The Chief Justice has been doing what
he could in New Mexico to enforce tue
laws and bring about a better order of
things. It has been his judgment all
along that only by the enforcement of tbe
law could the general morals be improved.
In New Mexico two-thirds of the entire
population is composed of native Mexi
cans, he says, while the other third is
American.
"The majority oi the natives are very
poor," said the Chief Justice; "they re
cite what is true, that there is no market
for corn, nor wool, nor other products.
The wool industry is paralyzed. As for
the silver interests, they are all lagging,
too. It is undeniably true that tbe great
majority of the people want free silver.
The question of whether or not it can be
sustained does not need to enter into it.
They want silver put back where it was
in 1873.
"I estimate we have about 175,000 people
in New Mexico, though the Governor in
his report makes the number somewhat
larger. The natives are the poorest peo
ple I have found anywhere. They are
poorer than the colored people of tbe
South. The larger number of them are
willing to work, but there is absolutely
nothing for them to do. The wool inter
ests are paralyzed, the agricultural inter
ests are limited, and to produce crops
there must be irrigation. New Mexico
has great resources, but the people being
poor and times hard, with no markets for
anything, there is general stagnation.
"Because of the great majority of natives
over the Americans it has been a question
among many whether it would be best for
New Mexico as it now is to be admitted as
a State. Many argue that the natives, so
long oppressed and naturally revengeful
against those in authority, would be for a
State Government, when tueir sympathies
are with Mexico. The natives, too, say
they are so poor they cannot pay their
taxes now, anl ask how they couid do it
under a State Government.
"Tbe natives are in the main law-abid
ing. The poorer of them, impelled by
hunger or resentment, sometimes commit
grave crimes, but generally they are good
observers and respecters of the statutes.
The increase of population is entirely
American. In some places where there
were little towns or pueblos a year ago
there is nothing now. The natives have
scattered. Where they have gone to is a
question. It is even thought by some that
there is a steady migration ot the natives
over the line to Mexico."
The Chief Justice is only making a brief
stay here. Mrs. Smith and Miss Games
preceded him by over a week. They have
been visiting Monterey and other places
besides this City.
FROM THE NORTH.
F. S. HtiHgey of the British Columbia
Police Pays the City a Visit.
F. S. Hussey, Superintendent of the
British Columbia Provincial Police, ac
companied by his wife, is enjoying a Cali
fornia vacation, and is at present a guest
at the Grand Hotel. He has just returned
from Los Angeles and expects to remain
in the City a week.
In professional circles Mr. Hussey's
name is one to conjure with and a whole
some terror to all evil-doers. Since his
appointment to the position of Superin
tendent he has been associated with many
celebrated criminal cases, which, in nearly
every instance, he has carried to a success
ful issue. One of the most recent and sen
sational in this category was the ro
mantic capture some two years ago of a
desperado named Hugh Lynn, who brut
ally murdered a wealthy northern rancher
and his companion. Lynn was arrested
on American territory after an exciting
chase, his trial, conviction and execution
following one another in- rapid succession.
Superintendent Hussey is himself a
man of determined character and power
ful physique, and as such admirably
qualified to fulfill those arduous duties
which are inseparable from the efficient
application of the law in a new and
sparsely settled country like British Co
lumbia.
KOWALSKY'S LIFE.
Coin Said to Be Doe by the Corpulent
Colonel on His Insurance
Policy.
W. 8. Morgan is a sorely troubled man.
He some time ago acquired a claim against
Colonel Henry I. Kowalsky. Now "he is
not sure that he would not be a loser if
the claim had cost him nothing.
There was a time when the colonel was
troubled with thoughts of the grave, so he
hunted up an agent and had his life in
sared.
Iv lieu of the premium which the com
pany demanded, a note was executed by
the insured promising to pay to himself
or order $386 40. The note was made pay
able at the Crocker- Woolworth Bank on a
stated day, and was indorsed to Alfred
Todhunter, who subsequently transferred
it to W. S. Morgan. It bore the date of
April 4, 1893.
Kowalsky has ailowed judgment to be
recorded against him on this note by de
fault. This judgment he succeeded in
having set aside.
The matter was on the calendar in
Judge Sanderson's court yesterday. The
defense wished a second judgment set
aside and the plaintiff's attorneys desired
to secure an order of examination, so as to
force the colonel to tell a curious world
what are his assets, in order that they
may know his reasons for not satisfying
the judgment.
As the colonel did not put in an appear
ance the matter went over until this
morning. .â¢
WOMAN SUFFRAGE WORK
Remotest Localities in the State
Are to Be Visited by
Speakers.
Miss Anthony and Mrs. Tupper-Ga'pin
Will Address To-Night's Rally
at Sausalito.
A number of well-known society people
intend accompanying Miss Susan B.
Anthony and Mrs. Kate Tupper-Galpin
to Sausalito this afternoon. After seeing
the sights of the terraced town tbe party
will attend a woman suffrage rally in
Slinkey's Hall at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Miss Anthony and Mrs. Tupper-Galpin
will both speaK, and a fine musical pro
gramme will be given. Miss Anthony is
also booked to speak at another suffrage
rally on Saturday night at the Grand
Opera-bouse, Martinez.
Friends of the woman suffrage cause
are looking forward with interest to Miss
Anna H. Shaw's promised address to
morrow night at the Mechanics' Fair.
A letter from Tulare County says that
three-fourths of the women and all the
men of that section seem to be in favor of
woman suffrage; while from Fresno comes
the news that a committee of fifty promi
nent business and professional men have
inaugurated a series of Sunday afternoon
meetings at which the equal suffrage ques
tion is to be discussed.
Meanwhile the counties which are out
of the way of railway communication are
receiving special attention, speakers male
and female traveling to the most isolated
settlements in carts, on horsebacK or as
best they may.
"We hope," said Miss Mary G. Hay, the
Btfete organizer, "to have the gospel of
equal political rights preached in every
nook and cranny of thi3 entire State before
the election; and though it keeps our
speakers on the go, we have the ground
nearly covered e*ven now."
IRAD B. COLDWELL DEAD.
Stricken With Heart Disease While
Bathing at Harbor View.
Irad B. Coldwell, 59 years of age, senior
member of the firm of Caldwell & Daily,
dairymen, was stricken wfth heart disease
and died at the Harbor View baths yester
day afternoon.
The deceased, who was apparently in

ThePolk-street Improvement Club, hav
ing for its purpose the improvement of
that street from Market to North Beach,
was permanently organized Monday
night by the election of L. H. Kohn of
1601 Polk street as president, Nathan Bibo
first and J. E. Quinn second vice-presi
dent, Robert Dross secretary and Q. F.
Roberts treasurer.
By-laws to govern the club, which now
numbers 124 members, were adopted.
There will be an executive committee of
seven appointed during the week by tha
president. The dues for the next six
mouths were fixed at 25 cents per month,
and the secretary and treasurer were
placed under $suO bonds each.
The club is composed of property
owners, storekeepers and people occupy
ing dwellings on the line of Polk street.
It was stated that the club, through its
executive committee, will act as au agita
tion committee to have the City officials
place the street in proper condition from
one end to the other, and pending such
action it was decided last night to
light the street from Sutter to Pacific
street with seventeen arc lights, one at tha
intersection of the cross street and one
between each cross street, so as to make
the thoroughfare the most brilliantly
lighted in the City. This will be at a cost
of about $40 a week, to be paid for, uatil
the Supervisors furnish the lights, by the
people on the street.

How Police Commissioner Gunst Found,
the Sentiment in the
;" # - â ".;': East.
Police Commissioner Gunst returned
yesterday morning irom a trip East. He
says the East is all for McKinley. .
"To show you how confident Eastern
judges of the situation are," he said, "I
have been commissioned by an Eastern
syndicate to put $50,000 at 2to 1 that Mo!
Kiniey is elected; even money that he car
ries New York by 50,000; at $800 to $1000
that he carries New York by 75,000, and
$1000 to $5000 that he carries New York by
125,000 votes."
Regarding what he saw in police circles
Mr. Gunst 'said:
"1 visited the police departments of
New York, Brooklyn and . Boston, and j I
wish to say that there is not one of them,
so far as appearance of the patrolmen is
concerned, which can compare with ours.
Brooklyn has a magnificent system. That
city has thirty-five station-houses, twenty-
I five of which cost $35,000 each; five $45,000, -
-two $50,000, two $60,000, and one now in
course of erection will cost $70,000. I had
inquiries everywhere for our Chief of- Po
lice and all wished him to pay them a
visit, as they know and admire his good
qualities. We have the reputation of hav
ing one of the finest and best organized
police departments in the country."
Knocked Down and Kicked.
Mrs. J. D. McQulddcy applied for a warrant
in Judge Campbell's court yesterday for the
arrest of her ex-husband on the charge of bat
tery. She said she had been granted a divorce
from him by Judge Troutt on Monday, and he
was ordered to pay her $10 alimony per week.
He sent her a note Monday night asking her to
meet him at 412 Eddy sreet. She went there,
and she says he upbraided her for getting a di
vorce and knocked her down and kicked her..

Election November 3, 1896.
Democrats have evidently decided to

as an issue.
o 1 The Non-Partisans may claim Mr. Phe
lan. but all the same Boss Rainey knows
â who dug him up.
People turn out to see Bryan when he
Roes to .their city, but they go to McKin
ley's city to see him.
' The question continually recurs: Why
does not some Democrat of prominence
help Bryan on the stump?
Every one knows t. c Republican party
can Rive this City a good government. Is
there any other party that can? j
There will be many local tickets in the
c . field, but the intelligent voters will soon
o learn which one it is best to vote for. j

The best excuse for the Yale boys is that
Bryan talks so much like a sophomore it
â¢was very easy for them to mistake him for
one and treat him accordingly. .
IAÂ» the Examiner declares it "knows
Bomethipg higher than party ( in local gov
ernment,'' it has evidently caught sight of
another $30,000 sack somewhere.
There was a time when Democracy could
at least muster up a candidate for the
United States senatorship, but that time
has mingled with the misty past. j
The East has begun already to talk about
the inclemency, of the weather. They
Beem to have nothing over there but hot
waves, inclement -weather and blizzards.
. There was a time when Henry George
was a consistent single taxer, but now he
goes about taxing the credulity of the peo
ple on every proposition of the campaign. '
No Republican should overlook the im
portance of the' legislative ticket in this
campaign. California must not elect an- '
other '; free-trader to the United States
Senate.
Has your industry derived any benefit
from the election of Cleveland, the tariff
reformer? Do you expect to derive any
benefit from the election of Bryan, the
free-trader?
Whitney became engaged on Friday and

. Men of standing in the City who have
accepted public service ana done their
work well deserve re-election, and that .is
the reason why the people will vote for
Charles L. Taylor. . *
The injury done to California industries
by free trade has been felt in every house
hold and the people on election day will
not forget that Bryan is one of the most
fanatical of free-traders.
Since The Call published the list of the
silver mines of the Hearst estate the
people of the whole country, have begun to
find out why the Journal in New York and
the Examiner in this City developed so rap
idly into advocates of Bryanism.
The silliest campaign cry ever started,
even by a Democrat, is the howl about
â¢workingmen being coerced to wear Mc-
Kinley buttons and join Republican cam
paign clubs. The only force which has
been put upon American labor in that
direction has been the pressure of Demo
cratic , bard times, and that indeed has
forced a good many free-traders to drop
their theories and come over to the side of
protection. ' ' "
In a recent speech to a delegation from
Lisbon, Ohio, McKinley, after referring to
the establishment there of a tinplate fac
tory, said: "I ' submit to you, no matter
what may have been your politics in the i
vast, whether you would not prefer ito
have that tinplate factory in your country
and in your State than to . have â¢ it 'in
Wales." That simple ; question . involves
the whole tariff question : Will you ' have
factories at home or abroad?
THE WAY TO HARMONY.
The discussion of yesterday in the Re
publican Stale Central Committee on the
condition of the affairs of the party in San
Francisco must have made it clear to all
who were present that the contest is one
between regularity and irregularity; be
tween those who are upholding the party
organization and those who are trying to
either control it or break it clown. That
much was established beyond a doubt by
the unanswerable argument of Mr. Watt,
and will have an important bearing on
whatever decision the committee reaches.
The element of regularity is essential to
all organizations. Every political party
in America has practiced it, and none
could exist without it. For years past the
Republican organization in San Francisco
has been entrusted to the management of
a central committee chosen to hold office
for two years and until its successor has
been duly elected and qualified. The
present committee is the orderly successor
of that which preceded it, and holds
office by an equal authority. Thus we
may go back step by step from one elec
tion year to another and find this line of
succession unbroken, each succeeding com
mittee being like its predecessor, the duly
authorized and recognized administrator
of party affairs until it 3 authority was
surrendered to another committee chosen
by a regularly called convention of the
Republicans of San Francisco.
This chain of regularity unbroken gave
the present committee the authority to
call the Republican Convention of San
Francisco to nominate local candidates
for office in the coming election. The
delegates to that convention were elected
at party primaries regularly conducted.
They met and organized as a convention
in due form and proceeded to nominate a
full ticket. That ticket Registrar Hinton
has filed in his office as the list of Repub
lican candidates. His action, which was
in strict accordance wiln law, gives the
official seal to the proceedings of the con
vention and confirms its regularity with
all the force- and effect of what is virtu
ally a judicial decree.
The regularity of the Auditorium con
vention being thus established beyond
controversy and the ticket of that con
i vention having been placed by the Regis
trar on the official ballot as the " Republi
can ticket," the members of the State
Central Committee have before them
nothing to decide except whether they
will support the party organization or not.
Each member of that committee knows
the rules of parly management. He
knows by whet processes Republican con
ventions are organized and committees
chosen in his own county. He knows,
moreover, that without regularity of this
kind there could be no such thing as an
organized party in the State.
When regularity and organization thus
confirmed and established have been duly
recognized by the State Committee, the
way to harmony will then be plain and
clear to all loyal Republicans. The County
Committee has already done much to
bring about harmony in tho ranks in this
City. It has made concession after con
cession to the opposing element of the
party. It has withdrawn a reerularly
nominated Presidential elector, W. W.
Montague, and substituted for him the
candidate of the irregulars, J. S. Spear.
It has conceded the nomination for Con
gress in the Fourth District to Mr.
O'Brien, the candidate of the Kelly party,
and consented to the withdrawal of its
own candidate. In response to these con
cessions made by the regulars, what have
j Mr. Kelly or his friends said or done?
The answer is known to every one; they
have said much about harmonyâ they
have done nothing for it. Is it not,
therefore, the plain duty of the State Cen
tral Committee to strongly advise the
Kelly faction to do their share toward
promoting harmony by supporting the
regular official Republican ticket?
It it sometimes said that we are opposed
to silver; that we are in favor of gold exclu
| sively. On the contrary, my countrymen, we
have done,, as a party, more for silver than
j any other party has ever done. It was the
1 Republican party that provided for the coin
age of silver in 1878, the coinage of the silver
dollar, and subsequently, in 1890, the coinage
of a greater number. Between those years
the Republican party gave to the people more
silver dollars than were ever comed â nearly
fifty times as many silter dollars as were
j coined prior to that time. We maintained
them, too, at par with gold, and we arc in
favor of more of them, too, if we can main
tain them at par with gold.â Senator Sher
man.
A NEW PROPOSITION.
Congressman Newlands, "Nevada's Sil
ver Champion," comes to Ban Francisco
occasionally to enlighten the benighted
hereabouts on the free-silver coinage ques
tion. No doubt he"knowÃ a good deal
I about the question, past, present and
prospective, but his enthusiasm rather
clouds nis judgment. He says things
sometimes which might better be left un-
I said, In the address he was kind and
I good enough to deliver at Metropolitan
I Temple awhile ago he crew conndential
] with his audience and said :
The mines of the present are in private own
ership. Tbe mines of the future are in tbe
ownership of tbe Government, and it will be
easy, should any undue production result
from the increased price of silver, by an ar
rangement with Mexico, to withdraw the min
eral lands trom grant, or to exact a royalty, or
to take some other method of restricting pro
duction so that it be equal to and not pass
beyond the existing demand.
Government ownership of the silver
mines of the country is a new proposition,
and an agreement with Mexico to restrict
production is a wonderfully wise sugges
tion no doubt. But does not Mr. New
lands admit too much when he suggests a
plan to close the mints against "iree' and
unlimited coinage" ? The supposition has
been that "free and unlimited coinage"
meant tnat the mints should coin all of
ferings, bnt Mr. Newlands does not so un
derstand it. He wants- to provide "some
method of restricting production." Re
stricted productiod would mean restricted
coinage, and since it is Mr. Newlands 1
plan to conler upon the Government the
right to say how much the mines shall
produce the conclusion is that he believes
real free and unlimited coinage would be
very bad for the people.
But Mr. Newlands would go still fur
ther to guard against unlimited coinage.
He proposes that the Government shall
own and control all the silver mines of the
country, which would enable it, in con
junction with Mexico, to keep the coinage
of silver within the requirements of com
merce. Of course that would necessitate
the absorption of all private mining prop
erty by the Government, lor otherwise the
Government would be.in competitionwith
its citizens. But Mr. Newlands' plan
necessarily provides for the purchase of
all private mines by the' Government,' and
right in that scheme may be found the
"joker" of the whole business.
The difference between Mr. Newlands'
plan and the Government's present sys
tem is that now the Government buys sil
ver and coins it on its own account, which
plan enables it to restrict coinage, while
Mr. Newlands 1 plan would make the Gov
ernment the owner of the mines, so that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 1896.
it could restrict coinage by restricting the
output ol the ore. Tweedledum vs. twee
dledee. This difference, however, would
obtain : Under the plan of Mr. Newlands,
mine-owners could unload their properties
upon the Government.
But the point of Mr. Newlands 1 address,
to which attention is called is the un
solicited admission that unlimited silver
coinage would be dangerous because of the
probability of the volume of silver dollars
becoming too large. Of course Mr. New
lands antagonizes the theories of Teller,
Bryan and all the other leaders of the free
and unlimited coinage movement, and
practically reads himself out of the free
silver party, but it is just possible that he
has jumped from the frying-pan into the
fire in advocating Government ownership
of the silver mines.
We want the best currency to measure the
labor of our people and to carry on our com
mercial relations with foreign countries. We
want the best standard of value for our own
peopU in their domestic exchanges; and the
Republican party, with McKinley at its head,
is determined that we shall have that great
boon. â Senator Sherman.
THE PEOPLE AND CANDIDATES.
The effort, of Bewail to belittle the influ
ence which the enormous Republican
majority at the Maine State election has
exerted and will continue to exert is
too much like the boy who whistles
when passing a graveyard to count
for much. And his assertion that
Bryanism is spreading rapidly in New
England is so stupidly foolish that
people are likely to conclude that Watson
is the better man of the two Vice-Presi
dential candidates. The fact is, had Bryan
felt that he was making converts he would
not have left New England so soon. There
would be more glory in carrying one of
those States than any three Western
States would give him, and if there is one
thing that Bryan dotes on it is glory.
Those who participated in the General
Scott campaign in 1862, and in the Greeley
campaign in 1872, will see the same kind
of elements accumulating to overthrow
Bryan that sent those distinguished men
to their everlasting political graves. Early
in the compaign the people traveled miles
to see Scott and Greeley, and such ovations
men seldem get, but no once could tell
whether the people were moved by curios
ity or enthusiasm until the campaign had
nearly spent itself. As the campaign
neared its close the people acted just as
people do after the circus is over. They
are really glad the show is over, and their
only recollection of the performers is as
sociated with the funny things they said
and did. None of them care a snap for
the showmen as people.
Bryan is affording the people rather
more amusement than Scott and Greeley
did; besides, with our improved urban
and suburban car service it is easier to
collect a crowd of 10,000 people now than
it was to get 1000 together when Scott ran,
or- 5000 when Greeley was on the stump.
Crowds these days indicate nothing in
particular. It is the sober thinking of the
people that decides National elections
these days. The .people read more and
judge for themselves more than at any
former period In the country's history.
Not only so, but they are more conserva
tive than they used to be, and it is hard to
induce them to depart from old and tried
paths. Bryauism is too new and too much
of an experiment for the people to indorse,
but they will hear what he has to say.
Bimetallism means the use of two metals,
and after you have the free coinage of silver
t here will be no money in circulation except
riUter. That is monovietallism. These people
who say they are bimetallists and that they
are in favor of the free coinage of silver are
deluded or mistaken, b. 'cause nothing is more
sure, as shown by the experience of mankind,
than that whenever you debase money that
money becomes the standard of value. â Sena
tor Sherman.
INCENDIARY SPEECHES.
Tillman and Altgeld are Bryan's closest
political friends. They have more influ
ence with him than the chairman of the
campaign committee. That is because he
likes their political views. Birds of a
feather flock together.. Mr. Eryan, how
ever, cannot quits keep up with Tillman.
He can say "cruel." "neartless" and "cor
rupt," when speaking of the leaders of the
Republican party, but it takes the South
Carolina partner to put things in true
Popocratic shape.
In the course of a speech last week Till
man took occasion to denounce the Su
preme Court, and among other things he
said: "If McKinley is defeated the Demo
cratic party will take the rascally Judges
by the throats and teach them that there
is yet liberty in the land." That kind of
talk is intended to breed sectionalism
and excite the worst passions of men. It
is an invitation to the lawless to vote for
Bryan under an implied promise that if
he is elected tbe authority of the courts
may be defied with impunity.
Senator Tillman is a representative
Bryanite. It is true, no doubt, that not
many Popocrats would indorse such in
cendiary speeches, but neither Mr. Bryan
nor the National Committee has repudiated
Tillman 's attack upon the Supreme Court,
and the inference is that Bryan quite
agrees with Tillman that the "rascally
Judges" should be taken "by the throat."
Things have come to a pretty pass when
a candidate for the Presidency Dermits
his lieutenants to asÂ£ the lawless to'break
the law and defy the courts.
Let honest and law-abiding people re
member what Tillman, Bryan's close
friend, says: "If McKinley is defeated the
Democratic party will take the rascally
Judges by the throats and teach them
that there is yet liberty in this land."
We think there was never a more mislead
ing statement than to call Ihe cause of free
silver the cause of the people, in contradis
tinction to what is called, the capitalist class.
TJie one class that might profit in the busi
ness wreck which would come with free silver
would be these same capitalists, with money
in hand to purchase property at forced sales,
while those who would suffer immeasurably
would be the common people. â Hon. S. B.
Capen of Massachusetts.
ON THE DOWN GRADE.
Tbe announcement that Bryan's man
agers have discovered a very rapidly
growing Populistic sentiment in the East
ern and Middle States, and that a large
force of orators will be sent thither will
fool no one. The returns from Vermont
and Maine clearly indicate the drift of
public sentiment in the New England
States, and only two or thrjee days ago one
of Bryan's National Committeemen gave
it out that all the country north of the
Ohir> and Potomac rivers and 6ast of In
diana was sure to go for Major McKinley.
The fact is, Bryan never had the ghost
of a chance to carry a single State east of
Indiana, and now he is losing ground in
the Mississippi Valley States, as any ob
server of passing events may see. The
announcement that speakers are to be
sent East is merely to bolster up the
cause in the West. If it could be made to
appear that the East was swinging around
to Bryan, the West would no doubt take a
new leaso of chunks oi enthusiasm and
make a very much stronger fight than if
weighted down with discouraging reports
from other quarters.
If Bryan has not passed over the too of
the hil!, and is not now going down the
other side at a pretty rapid gait every Bign
is frightfully misleading. He continues to
draw crowds, butit is to be observed that no
other speaker on his side is able to enthuse
the people. The people are willing to turn
out and make crowds for Bryan, but they
are not interested enough in his causa to
listen to any of his lieutenants. In fact,
Boies, Vest, Bland and the other promi
nent supporters of Bryan's candidacy are
ominously silent.
In California Cator, Mitchell. White,
together with Newlands of Nevada, con
tradict Bryan in nearly every one of his
propositions, and the people are begin
ning to wonder if there are as many
phases of the silver question as tnere are
speakers. Bryan says free coinage would
advance the price of silver per ounce to
$1 29, Cator says an American silver dollar
would not go in Europe and Newlands
says the Government should own the sil
ver mines so as to prevent too liberal offer
ings at the mints. In fact, nearly every
one of Bryan's former supporters is com
ing to the front with a better scheme.
Bryanism has seen its best days and it
will soon be only a recollection.
1 1/ believe in the American payroll. And I
do not believe in diminishing that payroll by
giving work to anybody else under another
flag while we have an idle man under our
fiag.â McKinley.
WHAT LABOR WANTS.
What this country needs Is a perfectly
sound circulating currency and a tariff
that will afford enough protection to our
industries to enable them to maintain a
high wage schedule. If these two things
are secured and made permanent, the
people will do the rest. As for a sound
circulating currency, we have one now,
only that owing to our constantly increas
ine trade with other peoples a larger vol
ume of redemption money is now or soon
will be needed. That need, however, is
well understood by the Republican party,
and at the earliest day possible a confer
ence will be held between those in in
terest, when a basis for conferring full
redemption power npon silver will be
established. The Republican party is
committed to that, and the other nations
being apprised of the fact will no doubt be
in readiness to co-opdfeite with this coun
try soon after Mr. McKinley is inau
gurated.
But our circulating money already being
as sound and stable as the wisdom of man
could make it â the only need being a
larger volumeâ the work of inaugurating
a system of protection to American indus
try becomes the first and highest duty of
the incoming administration. In fact,
we shall need no increase in the
volume of money until we provide
a demand for an increase. There is an
enormous amount of idle money in the
United States, and it will remain idle on
til the various industries are in a condi
tion to give employment to the armies of
unemployed. The moment our mills and
factories are assured that tbey will not be
crowded out of our own markets by foreign
industrial products money in ample quan
tity will be forthcoming. There is no
doubt about that, for idle capital is just as
anxious to go to work as idle labor.
There are hundreds of thousands of
wording people in tiiis country who are
! waiting for the word to take off their
I coats and go to work, and they know it is
I not because there is no money to pay them
j for their services that they are idle, but
j because the markets in which their prod
i ucts would have to be sold are overrun
with similar products made in other coun
tries. The cause of the present depression
in our industrial field is well knowu and
understood by the working class, and they
know it is not the money question but the
question of opening the channels of em
ployment that is the important one; and
the candidate who subordinates the in
dustrial situation to the money question
will exert no influence in labor circles.
It is opportunity to earn some of the
money that now is rather than more
money and less opportunity to earn wages
that labor wants just now.

THE MONARCH
OF HYPOCRITES.
What Contemporaries Say
of Mr. Hearst's
Course.
No Wonder He Is for Bryan
When He Has Millions
Invested in Silver
Mines.
A few days since The Call directed at
tention to the fact that Mr. Hearst's in
vestments in silver mines might have
influenced the course of his two papers in
their advocacy of Bryanism. This was, of
course, merely a suggestion, bnt the man
ner in which it was received by the press
of the City and State is remarkable. With
one accord they speak out and in no un
certain tones.
"No wonder," exclaims one indignant
editor, "the Examiner is for free silver
when over $8,000,000 of the Hearst estate
is invested in silver mines."
Another journalist dips his pen in ink
to write: "Nobody, though, expects the
Examiner to be consistent; nobody ex
pects it to be decent."
Still another epitomizes his opinion of
our contemporary thus: "The Examiner
is the monarch of hypocrites."
The following extracts may prove inter
esting reading:
A MONARCH OUT OF LUCK.
Woodland Mail.
The Call's exposure of the poor old Exam
iner Is causing it to show its teeth and lose its
temper. The monarch is decidedly out of luck
of late.
NO WONDER.
Placer Republican.
No wonder the Examiner is for free silver
when over $8,000,000 of the Hearst estate is
invested in silver mines. And yet this jour
nal is posing as a disinterested advocate for
the dear people.
LOOK OUT FOR THEM.
Pasadena Star.
Look out for campaign lie 6in the Examiner!
That is an enterprising journal and "gets
onto" the latest mendacity with an ability
worthy of a better cause. You wiil find out
these inauy things that are not soâ and find
it out early.
A GOOD REASON.
Paradise Star.
A good reason has been discovered for one
Democratic editor favoring free coinage: Mr.
Hearst of the Examiner would make $65,000
a month additional profit out of one mine
aloneâ the Ontario â that he owns. Does he
need any better reason than that for the faith
that is in him?
THE REASON WHY.
Woodland Mall.
The Call threw a bomb into the Examiner-
Journal camp Saturday by publishing a state
ment showing that the Hearst estate is inter
ested in silver mines to the extent of $5,911,
-691. This explains In a grem measure why
these two papers are supporting Bryan. It is
not through love of the poor workman, as they
would make believe, but for Willie Hearst, the
silver-mine owner.
IN THE CAUSE OF DECENCY.
Vallejo Chronicle.
The San Francisco Call is exposing the
hypocrisy of the Examiner on the money
question, and is thus doing a service to the
cause of decency. The Examiner is a fakir in
the strictest sense of the term; its political
headings are fakes on the subject matter
which follows them; it is woeiuiiy hypocriti
cal because it charges as a crime that of which
it is iueli shamelessly guilty. The Examiner
is the monarch of the hypocrites.
NOT TO BE WONDERED AT
Holllster Free Lance.
It is scarcely to be wondered at that the
Examiner is for "free silver." According to
last Saturday's Call the late Senator Hearst
left his widow and son some $5,000,000 worth
of sliver mining stock. With the Anaconda
Mining Company's stock not counted, as it has
since been sold, the estate still owns $1,769,
-529 worth. "Free silver" means a great deal
to the proprietor of the San Francisco Exam
iner and the New York Daily Journal.
IT HAS CHANGED.
Santa Rosa Republican.
In 1895 tbe Examiner was a sound-money
paper. Then it declared in favor of a sliver
dollar containing a dollar's worth of silver.
May 4, 1895, it said Its experience had not en
couraged it to believe that this country could
mail tain parity of value of the two metals at
16 to 1, and suggested 25 to 1. Then that
uaper stood by Carlisle and opposed 50-cent or
90-cent dollars. The Call is now republish
lng those articles, to the disc mfiture oi the
Examiner in its present position.
IT IS PECULIAR,
Berkeley Gazette.
The San Francisco Call is now drawing a
deadly parallel npon the Examiner and is pro
ducing it* editorials of April and May last, in
which the independent free coinage of silver
at a ratio of 16 to 1 is treated as a dangerous
experiment, in which success is almost impos
sible. Jt commended Carlisle's Memphis
speech and criticized the Illinois Democrats
wnen they adopted their free-silver platform.
"For ways that are dark and tricks that are
vain tne oily Examiner Is peculiar."
CANNOT BE CONSISTENT.
.Alameda Atrtis.
The Call Is trying to prove the Examiner to
be inconsistent on the silver question by pub
lishing some of its editorials of the past. Not
necessary. Nobody expects it to be consistent,
even in one issue. No body expects it even to
be fair or decent. Nobody cares what its
policy or politics is. Who thinks of arraign
ing the pink papers of the barber-shops for
their lack of consistency or their flip-flopping
on questions of public interest'/ Who looks to
them for lessons in, or examples of, or incite
ments to morality? Why The Call should at
tempt such an unnecessary and undemanded
service we are unable to see.
A BITTER DOSE INDEED.
Monterey Cypress.
The San Francisco Call is working the
"deadly parallel" on the Examiner, showing
the latter's position on the silver question a
year ago. The Examiner has evidently found
out that It is receiving a dose of its own medl
ciae.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Well, we are still patiently waiting for the
answer as to where the San Francisco Exami
ner stands on the civil service question. Is It
afraid of the second dose of its own medicine,
"deadly parallels."
* Â« â¢
What do the rest of the Popocratic papers of
California think now that tne Examiner hu
been caught at its own game? Oh, yes, the
Examiner is doing noble (?) work for silver's
cause !
THAT DEADLY PARALLEL.
Stockton Independent.
The "deadly parallel" has been Indulged in
by the Examiner to show that several promi
nent Republican speakers and newspapers
have changed their vie ws on the silver ques
tion within a year or two. This was done in
apparent forgetfulness that the same weapon
could be used against itself. The Call, how
ever, was not so forgetful, and in yesterday's
issue reproduces trom tbe Examiner of June
27, 1890, an article of some length, in which
it took funstantial'.y the same ground as the
National Republican platform idopted one
year later, which it now condemns. It goes
even farther and points out tbe evils that
would follow irom the United States returning
to free coinage of silver, just as the Republi
cans are doing now. To show that this article
was not a mailer of inadvertence The Call
quotes from five other articles of different
dates, all to the same tenor and effect so far as
free coinage is concerned.
AN INTERESTING LIGHT.
Boston Herald.
The San Francisco Call publishes a schedule
of the late Senator Hearst's estate, showing
the total value of Its holdings of silver min
ing shares to be $6,039,619 12. This throws
an interesting light on the metropolitan jour
nalism of to-day.
Chicago Inter Ocean.
A very bright light is thrown on metropoli
tan journalism in New York in the announce
ment of the San Francisco Call that "the
schedule of property of the late Senator
Hearst's estate shows it contains silver min
ing shares to the amount of $6,039,691."
â¦
INCONSISTENCIES EXPOSED
Napa Register.
The Call devotes considerable space to the
showing up of Millionaire Hearst's free coinage
record, and in doing so quotes freely from the
Examiner of dates not very far back. Here is a
sample paragraph. It shows how strongly the
Examiner was against free coinage June 27,
1895 1
The free coinage of silver under proper Inter
national agreement would help our trade with nil
the world, but frÂ«e coinage by this country alone,
unless it succeeded la bringing both metals to a
DP.rity, which would hardly De possible, would
certainly injure our commerce with countries
having the gold s:andarrt. We see tbe same effect
now In countries that arc on a silver basis. The
fluctuations in the price of silver so disturb inter
national exchange as to make trade between gold
and silver using countries partake of tne nature of
a gamble. All the profits of a transaction may be
wiped out by a change in the silver market, or, on
the other hand, they may De doubled. This is a
discouragement to legitimate commerce and tends
to put trade In the hamls, of speculators.
THOSE SILVER MINES,
San Francisco News Letter.
The Call has dealt the Examiner some
weighty blows during the week. Hereafter
nobody can have a doubt that neither the San
Francisco Examiner nor the New York Jour
nal is worth reading on the subject of coin
age. The interest of their proprietor, W. R.
Hearst, is so largely made up of silver mines
that he could easily afford to buy two or three
more "great dallies" and run them for noth
ing, If only Bryan and a silver Congress be
elected. Of course he would not think of run
nlug them at that price, but he could if he
wished. He is not, however, that kind of a
man. There is, notwithstanding his great
wealth, not a more nimble, or unprincipled
catcher of nickels in all this land. His nu
merous devices, often made up of hatred and
falsehood, to conjure small coins out of the
pockets of his readers into his own, have about
sickened all the better elements of our local
society.
For so young a man, raised with the double
advantage of money and education, his greed
and low morals are phenomenal. The Call
has goue to first hand lor its information as
to his interest in silver mines. It published
the sworn inventory filed in court of the
Hearst estate, from which it appears that the
estate consists of mining Interests to the VAlue
of ."58,750,000. Four large and valuable silver
mines make a considerable figure in the list
One of them is said to be easily worth $7,000,
-000. If the silver-mine owners are to ha*re
their product nearly doubled in value â and
that is the sole aim of the Bryan campaignâ it
is very palpable why Mr. Ueurst became such
an enterprising advocate of silver, as soon as
he thought there was a chance oi mating such
advocacy a success. He did not always appear
to be for silver, but that was when he thought
it would kill his papers if he permitted them
to say what he thought. Hence, it came that
his writers were permitted to go as far as they
liked for cold, and The Call furnishes curious
reading in showing now far that was.
It was not until after Bryan's nomination
that he dared to change the course of his New
York Journal, which previously had as good
editorials as he can procure â which is not say
ing muchâ ln favor of the gold standard. Up
to then he lived in fe*r and trembling as
to the possible loss of the nickels ot the
proletariat if he abandoned the advocacy of
honest money. But Bryan's speech, nomina
tion and temporary popularity gave Hearst
the opportunity he wanted, and he promptly
switched around to what, iv point of fact, is
nothing more nor less than booming his own
silver interests. That may be worldly wis
dom, bnt it is downright disgraceful journal
ism, which no honest man respects. But,
really, does Mr. Hearst care for the respect ot
honest men? Since his exposure in the rail
road blackmailing case there are not many
men who believe he does. His course since
then has been such that the general belief is
that he will have blood or die in the attempt.
His brief career furnishes a curious object
lesson. He is a conspicuous example of the
danger inherited wealth is to a young man ap
parently without scruples or honor.

Letters from the People.
Silver Under Free Coinage.
Some Fallacies of Silver Men Stated and
Exposed.
Editor San Francisco CaJJâ Dear Sir: Will you
kindly expose the fallacious statement made
by the Examiner in its editorial of Sunday,
and which it reiterates, in nearly the same
language everyday, namely: That "the people
of the United States egree to take silver at
$1 29 per ounce."
The oeople of the United States have made
no such offer. What does the Examiner mean
by "takins silver at $1 29 per ounce"? Taking
implies giving something in exchange. No
offer of anything else is proposed to be made;
only to give back to the silver-owner his metal
coined into dollars. That is not taking his
Filver. I don't think the people of the United
States want to give their gold or labor or prod
ucts for silver at twice its present actual value.
The Examiner instances Rockefeller offering
25 cents per dozen for all the eggs in the
country, but fails to point out the difference
between his paying money for the eggs and
the United States simply returning the silver
bullion to its owner stamped into dollars, the
value of which is an undetermined quantity.
It is by such juggling with words and sophis
try that the Examiner befuddles and bemud
dles many a reader.
It continually hams on the statement that
at the utmost only about $200,000,000 worth
of silver bullion could be turown on our mar
ket. I admit that the silver token money in
use among nations that are on the gold basis
would not flow in on us except, perhaps, in
cases like that of France and Germany, whose
banks hold a large and idle reserve of such
coin; but I contend that all the rest of the
world would stand ready to exchange its sil
ver for our gold or products ii we stood ready
to make such exchange as the Examiner
wants to insinuate and make its readers be
lieve, paying for such silver at twice its com
mercial value. Tho world would be ready to
accommodate us even if silver under free
coinage would advance to $1 25 per ounce.
Would you kindly furnish iv your valued
paper an estimate of what amount of silver
would likely be thrown in upon us, allowing
for argument's sake the ridiculous proposition
that we could advance the bullion v'*lue to
$1 25 per ounce? Yours respectfully,
I. H. Mayer.
[The approximate amount of silver in the
world is reported to be worth about $4,000,
-000,000. The output for 1895 Is given by the
Mint Bureau at 1/4,796,875 ounces, having a
coinage value of about $226,000,000. If the
price rises to $1 25 per ounce measured by
gold the output would largely increase. How
much would come to this country under the
conditions named cannot be calculated -with
any degree of accuracy. Enough would cer
tainly be sent to us to reduce the price here to
the level o* that in other parts of the world
less the fi ignt required to ship it here.
Whether that amount would be large or small
is of little moment since in either case it
would be enough to depreciate our currency to
the basis of the price of silver in the market of
the world.â Editob Call.]

The Holiinwood and E lis'and Nearly
Went Ashore on the Potato
Patch.
With z fair wind and flowing sail one
of the largest fleets of deep-water snips
that has come to this port in. many a
moon got in yesterday. The Golden Gate
was crowded with them, and almost every
class of sailing and steam craft was repre
sented. There were sugar-boats from
Honolulu, coal ships from Australia, barks
from European ports, tramp steamers that
come and go in the night, tugs in num
bers and a goodly supply of coasters.
Among the many that got in was the
S. C. Allen, twenty-two days from Hono
lulu; lnvermark, seventy-tnree days from
Sydney, N. S. W. ; Jane "Burrill, 101 days
from Melbourne, Victoria, in ballast; Pe

General Siglin, eighteen days from Ko'liak
witti furs. The Ciampi and Poit Cale
donia both made good runs from Aus
tralia, tbe Italian ship winning the race
by the comfortable margin of twenty-four
hours.
The tramp steamers were all moving to
their docks ana tbe scow schooners were
fully in evidence. All in all, yesterday
was one of the busiest times seen on the
bay in months.
All the arrivals report fair weather, and
not an accident marred any of the voy
ages. The Jabez Howes from Philadel
phia made an unusually Jong trip to the
Horn, but once in tbe Pacific Captain
Clapp made up for lost time. Off the
i'aralloncs he was caught in a calm and
was delayed two days. The Howes is the
hrst sbip that has come direct to San
Francisco from Philadelphia In many a
day. She carries a carjio of general mer
chandise. During hisspare moments Cap
tain Clapp made a remarkably handsome
model of a yacht. She is intended as a
present for his little son, and has been
named "Maude," after his daughter. The
captain is well known in San FrancUco
and his many friends were down to wei
come him yesterday when the vessel
docked.
The big clipper Sbenandoah is some
where outside and her agents are looking
for her every minute. She was spoken by
both the Jabez Howes and Port Caledonia.
She is not a fast sailer in lizht winds, but
Captain Murphy can be depended upon to
bring bis ship in on time. 'She is one of
the handsomest and t>est kept American
vessels that come to this port.
Tbe Harbor Commissioners discussed
the coal question yesterday. Tney have
to get a supply for iheir tugs and wharf

V. B. Cornwall offered white ash coal at
$5 and R. D. Chandler Rosslynn coal at
$5 25. Other bids ranged upward to Duns
inuir's $7 39 for Wellington. Commis
sioner Cole thought the bid should be
given to Cornwall, but President Colnon
said an investigation should be made, so
the matter was laid over for one week.
Captain Scott, the pilot, reports that the

A. P. Lorentzen was around town yes

never struck. Nevertheless, he intends to
make "it hot" for the men who have had
the audacity to refuse a $150 "lay" on
f kins that are worth $500 in the open
market. Tbe whole matter will be aired
in tbe Federal courts.
The British ships Holiinwood and Ellis
land had narrow escapes last Monday.
Both vessels were towed to sea and cast off
beyond the whistling buoy.
The wind failed them arid they began to
drift in toward the Potato Patch. Cap
tain Meyer had left the Holiinwood, but
when he saw the vessel's danger be at
once put back and remained aboard until
he worked her out to sea. .Captain Jordan
was on board the Ellisland for fourteen
hours before he could make an offing and

DISOBEYED A JUDGE.
A Jury That Refused to Acquit a
Prisoner When Ordered
To Do So.
Despite Judge Belcher's instruction to
acquit Antone Lengo of a charge of burg

in a verdict of guilty in the second de
gree.
Lengo and Henry Nevel, his room-mate,
were arrested on suspicion of having
robbed several places. A quantity of
stolen property wag found in their room.
It was proved during the trial, however,
that Lengo was not implicated with bis
chum, and on motion of the defense
Judge Belcher instructed tne jury to bring
in a verdict of not guilty. After a long
discussion the twelve talesmen overruled
the instruction of the court and brought
in the decision mentioned.
A new trial, at which Lengo will be ac
quitted, will probably be granted.
POPULAR RATES.
Another Inexpennive Onting at Camp
Taylor Next Sunday.
Many people who desired to avail them
selves of the recent 75-cent rate to Camp
Taylor did not go on account of the threat

for another excursion to that delightful
section for next Sunday, on which occa
sion the popular 75-cent rate for adults
and 40 cents for children under 12 will pre

MILK AND COWS
OF CALIFORNIA
First Session This Year
of the State Dairy
men.
Discussion of Matters of Great
Interest to the Dairy
Industry.
CHEESE-MAKING AS IT IS.
Major Alvord of the United States
Bureau of Animal Industry
en Tubercelin.
The annual convention of the California
Dairy Association was callea to order in
the Chamber of Commerce rooms, yester
day morning, with Joseph Maillnrd of
San Geronimo as president and Samuel E.
Watson as secretary.
The president, in his annual address,
dwelt upon the association, its objects and
the work that had been accomplished.
He said many dairymen were not aware
MAJOR ALVORD of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry*
that tbe association had been organized to
aid the industry in getting legislation and
otherwise. It aimed to place the dairy
men of this State on a level with those of
the East, who had superior educational
advantages. One of the chief objects was
to prevent, by legislation and other means,
the adulteration of products. The first
year of tbe association was an important
one. as the battle against oleomargarine
was fought and won, with the result that
the market was now in a better condition
than it would otherwise have been. There
had been an overproduction of butter and
cheese, as many had engaged in dairying
because they had failed in other pursuits.
Notwithstanding the quantitative over
production the quality was not such as
would command a market outside of the
i State. The speaker called attention to
| the need of education in dairying, such as
was given in other States. As to tuber
culosis, all dairymen hoped some way
would be found of protecting the public
health witnout injuring the dairymen.
As a means to this he advised a strength
ening of the association.
Mr. Rousell moved the appointment of
an investigating committee to inspect
dairies in which it was complained that
cows were affected with tuberculosis.
Mr. Le Baron urged the action of the
association in securing good roads.
E. F. AdaniÃ suggested that the average
of California butter should be raised.
At tbe afternoon session there was a full
attendance, and the first paper read was by
Dr. P. K. Brown, representing the Acad
emy of Sciences, on tbe inspection of dairy
cows for tuberculosis.
In the outset he called the attention of
the meeting to n treatise on tuberculosis
and its effect on the human race. He
then described tbe bacilli and the number
that are thrown off by a patient affected
by tuberculosis.
He showed that by the experiments of
Professor Ernest the milk from a cow
affected with tuberculosis is exceedingly
dangerous, particularly when the under is
affected with the disease. Tbe presence
oi the disease is often found in cows with
out the udder being affected.
He then spoke of the character of the
meat of the tuberculosis-affected animal
and tbe methods that are employed in
Germany to prevent the disposition of
such meat for human food. The propor
tion of the people who are affected by par
taking of meat of tuberculosis-affected
animals, he said, could not be determined.
The way to destroy tuberculosis that may
be in meat used for food is first by boiling,
then by roasting and last by cooking be
fore the are.
Tbe proposition to regulate the food for
the market by officials ia not always the
safest, because the difficulties in the way
I of such supervision are obviously so great
that some years must eiapse before auy
measure of "an effective kind could be car
| ried into operation in American cities,
where political positions are not always
wisely rilled.
He spoke of the use of tuberculin for the
purpose of discovering tuberculosis in
cattle, said it is most effective and spoke
in favor of its use in this State.
Major Alvord of the United States
Bureau of Animal Industry spoke in a
general way of the manner in which the
Government issues tuberculin. He said
tbat it is sent to boards of health and to
| persons who give evidence of fitness to
I use tbe tuberculin and furnish results.
The secretary read a letter from H. H.
Taylor of the Milbrae dairy suggesting
that the use of tuberculin should be
made to conform to the condition of the
local cow, and that the University of Cali
fornia should manufacture the tuberculin
and furnish it at cost. He also suggested
that if a cow is found affected the owner
should be allowed to drive it to a fertilizer
factory so as to be enabled to obtain a
certain remuneration for the property he
is forced to destroy.
There was a discussion on the present
I methods of inspection in this State and
j the necessity of v law that would provide
! compensation for animals that may have
Ito be destroyed. The matter of tne man
i i er in which the San Francisco Board of
Health acts in quarantining milk was
I mentioned, and Mr. Howard stated that
i lie was having a legal opinion prepared
which he will present to-day.
Professor M. B. Jaffa of the agricultural
department of the University of California
read a paper on cattle foods. He went
into a long technical explanation of the
relative value of foods for cattle and gave
the result of analyses of California'and
Eastern food. The foods dwelt upon were
mixed feed, phorts, middlings, bran
(wheat), bran linseed, oatcake meal, co
coanut meal, cottonseed meal, burr clover,
beet pulp, beet pulp silage, clover and
corn silage. Beet pulp, he declares, has
proved a most valuable food for cows.
J. v. Pearson, superintendent of tne
Fallon creamery of Tom ales, read a very
interesting paper on cheese-making in Cal
ifornia. He showed that in 1850 150
pounds of cheese was made in this State;
in 1860, 1,343,000 pounds; in 1870, 4,395,000
pounds; in 1890," 4,962,000 pounds, and in
1895. 9,000,000 pounds. He declared that
California has greater advantages for
cheese-making than the East, yet the in
dustry is not carried out as it 'should be,
as is shown by the large importation from
tbe East and tbe reduced price for which
California has to sell in order to compete.
This entahs a lose to California dairymen
of $320,000. This could be saved to them
if they would manufacture* better quality
of cheese â in fact California cheese can be
made to attain a repute as great as that
possessed by California fruit. He urged
the establishment of a school of Instruc
tion, so that dairymen could learn how to
make first-class cheese..
Professor Wickson said that he indorsed
all that Mr. Pearson bad said, but thought
he had not stated it strong enough.
President Mailiard said that it was a
shame that people should have to buy
Eastern cheese if they want a quality that
will last for several days.
Major Alvord, upon request, said a few
words on the subject of cneese-making,
stating that California, so far as his obser
vations went, has very great advantages
for the industry. He urged tbe dairymen
te stick to full cream cheese if they desired
to keep up a good reputation. He called
attention to tbe fact that the exclusive use
of alfalfa as food for cows has a tendency
to give milk, butter and cheese a taste
that is not agreeable.
In answer to a question, be said that
while it was true that skim milk cheese is
nutritious, it ia not advisable to make
such.
Tbe programme for to-day will bÂ«: At
the morning session Professor C. W.
Woodworth will advance some ideas on
important points in Btate inspection;
Major Alvord of the Bureau of Annual In
dustry will suggest plans for securing dairy
legislation; in the afternoon Dr. R. H.
Freund will give results of microscopic
research into the nature of tuberculosis
bacilli; Professor Wickson will read a
paper on "What the cow ought to do for
tbe dairyman, and what the dairyman
ought to do for the cow"; there will be a
paper by A. H. Sbrite on creamery man
agement; William Vanderbilt, secretary
of tbe California bureau, will recommend
the revising the present dairy law; the
secretary will read his report on the year's
work, and in the evening officers will be
elected, after which there will be an ad
journment to the Mechanics' Pavilion.

Passengers to Be Carried There
on the Valley Road on
Monday.
Will Take the Invited Guests Who
Are to Participate in the
Celebration.
Most of the session held by the directors
of the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway Company yesterday was
devoted to the consideration of the re
quest of the Fresno celebration commit
tee for an excursion train on October 5,
Labor day.
The Fresno people propose to make that
day one long to be remembered by every
one who is fortunate enough to be in the
metropolis of the raisin belt on that date.
The advent of the Valley road is the chief
motive for the celebration, and as most
fitting and appropriate to the occasion the
committee has asked the Valley road offi
cials to provide and operate its first pas
senger train between Stockton and Fresno
on tne day in question.
It took little time to accede to the wishes
of the Fresnoites, most of the discussion
being in the form of suggestions as to how
to arrange things so as to best please the
people of Fresno. It was finally decided
to make up a train of the six fine passen
ger coaches now at Stockton and two of
tne combination smoking and baggage
cars and place it at the disposal of the
celebration committee.
Transportation on this train will be re

Bistrop Johnson of Los Angeles, who took
the matter up from a city standpoint, and

"SMALL SOULS, BIG LIARS."
The Record, One of Five Bishops Said,
"Which California Once Enjoyed.
Five Bishops and thirty-one clergymen
of tae Episcopal church participated in a
banquet Monday night at the Occidental
Hotel.
The Right Rev. Bishop Nichols sat at
the table and acted as toaslmaster. In a
o happy vein he made the initial speech of
the evening and then called J in turn upon
the visiting . Bishops and later upon sev
eral clergymen and upon one of the com
mittee men connected with the improve
ment of the Episcopal Divinity School at
San Mateo.
Bishop Nichols noticed with pride the
large number of clergymen assembled and
said that he had received regrets from
Â» others who found it impossible to attend.
Among such were .Bishops Wells, Morris
and Poe ana clergymen detained at home
by illness. He referred by way of com
parison to a time in 1854 when the ven
erated Bishop Kip had found but two
Episcopal clergymen in San Francisco. In
a happy little anecdote of a braggart Con
gressman from Texas he declared that
California had always been accorded the
record for "small souls and big liars."
Only one of those records, he said, now
remains. The visiting Bishops in proudly
telling yesterday morning of their respec
tive districts had shattered one of those
records. o â¢
Bishop Leonard did not say a great deal
about Utah, but he maintained the same
happy, rambling style that the toast
master bad suggested. He told of a Detroit
paper that describing a similar gathering
of clergymen announced the next morn
ing that there were eighteen full Bishops
at the banquet; and so the good-humored
remarks went

"PACIFIC YOUTH."
The Boys' Training Home Starts a Mew
Paper.
The Boys' Training Home has just is
sued the first num ber of a periodical called
Pacific Youth. It is a bright, attractive
paper, cleverly written and well illus
trated.
It is intended that Pacific Youth shall
help to support the home. The paper will
be printed and illustrated by the boys
themselves, and tne little fellows have
opened a photographic gallery in connec
tion with the new enterpriae. All the
work will be done at the home, 407 Taylor
street. Just at the beginning, of course,
professional help hits been called in, to
make the handsome half-tone which
adorns the first pace, and to aid in setting
up the type, but the boys have set to work
witn a will, and they will soon be able to
get out the paper themselves.
Seme of the boys in the home have set
to work to work up routes, and the little
carriers have already been rewarded with
a number of promises of subscriptions.
Pacific Youth costs $1 a year, or 10 cents
for a single copy.
LETTER CARRIERS.
KnthiMinntic Sleeting of the Convention
Association and Important Busi
ness Done.
An enthusiastic meeting of the San
Francisco Letter Carriers' Convention As
sociation was held in Judee Conlan's
Courtroom Monday night, John L. Meares
presiding.
A committee of arrangements consist
ing of thirty-five members was appointed
to make the necessary preparations for
the next annual convention to be held in
this city.
The souvenir committee submitted its
report, which was adopted, and the com
mttee was instructed to closa the contract
for printing the souvenir. It will
embrace portraits of all the Post
masters of the city and members
of the association, " sketches of the
most interesting features of the City, and
a lot of valuable information. It will be a
credit to tbe City in every respect, and
will be a splendid souvenir for citizens to
send to friends at a distance. It has been
got up for the purpose of raising funds
to defray tne heavy expenses that will be
incurred in entertaining the delegates.
Business men are expected to buy large
numbers of the souvenir, as the conven
tion will be one of the best advertisements
lor the City, and to make it a success the
support of the public is necessary.
R. M. Roche, a delegate to the recent
convention in Grand Rapids, Mich., sub
mitted bis report in detail. The delegates
were received right royally by those in
attendance, and the California wines do
nated by wine-dealers did a _great deal
toward helping this City to secure next
year's convention.
YOUTH, KING OF THE FAIR

Boys' Brigade and the
Y. M. C. A.

"Dairymen's Day."
The awards for the greater part of the
exhibits at the Mechanics' Fair were an

by E. A. Denicke, president of the Me
chanics' Institute. As yet some of the
committ -es have not completed their in

week.
The Young Men's Christian Association,

CHINO SUGAR BEETS.
j A Display at the Fair Particularly
Worthy of Meritorious
Mention.
1 An exhibition at the fair which has at
tracted considerable attention, and one
that is particularly worthy of special men
tion by the Mechanics' Institute Home
Products Exposition, is the exhibit of the
beet-sugar industry at Chino, inasmuch as
it would appear that this State has en
tered in an intelligent way upon the de
velopment of a great new American in
dustry.
A sale of this famous ranch was recently
effected, and the property belongs now to
a firm of English financiers. The Chino
ranch is located in San Bernardino, Orange
and Los Anceles counties, and comprises
I about 40,000 acres of land. Eastoa, Eld
j riage & Co. completed the negotiations of
1 the sale, which, had been in progress for
i over a year.
In speaking of sugar-beet raising in
! California Wendell Easton, of the iirra of
Easton, Eldridge & Co., who are handling
the sale of the property of the Chino
ranch for the recent purchaser?, had the
following to say:
"While California as a State is remark
ably productive, and while many portions
of the State are suited to the general
agriculturist, the inducements for beet-
raising at Cbino is one of the most attrac
tive and profitable investment proposi
tions in the entire State of California. It
can be demonstrated to the most critical
j that the laud will grow the best speci
| men of beet production in our State, and
these same products can be turned into
money each season."
AN EARLY ROBBER.
j The North End Loan Office Looted of
Valuable Jewelry and
Watches.
One of the most daring robberies com
mitted in some lime was reported at the
Central Police Station yesterday. The
detectives are diligently searching for the
thief or thievet, but so far without suc
cess.
Yesterday morning between the hours
of 5 and 6 o'clock some one shattered the
front window of the North End loan office,
509 Washington street, and succeeded in
getting away with watches and jewelry to
the value of $300. At 5 o'clock an officer
passed by the place, and everything was
then in proper shape. -An hour later he
traversed the same beat, and the robbery
was discovered.
There was blood on the sill and pave
ment, showing that the thief had evidently
bÂ»en severely injured in breaking the
glass, which was a quarter of an inch
thick. The proprietor of the establish
ment was sleeping in one of the rear
rooms, but knew nothing of the affair
until informed by the officer.
Wealthy Chinese Arrive Here.
P. F. Tung and P. Y. Kwai, young and
wealthy Chinamen, wbo have for some time

tries, arrived here last night and are at tae

Knights of the Maccabees
Meet in Annual
Convention.
Local Tents Tender a Brilliant
Reception to the Los An
geles Team.
ITS PICTURESQUE DRILL CORPS
Something About the History of the
Orderâ Comprises Seventy Tents
in This State.
The Knights of the Maccabees of Cali
fornia met in annual session last night
in Washington Hall on Eddy street, and
will be in session again this evening.
The convention was made up of one
delegate from each tent, as the subordi
nate bodies are designated.
There were 180 delegates when the con-
Officers of the Knights of Maccabees of California.
vention was called to order, and after an
explanation of the ritual adopted last
January nine candidates were initiated
for Mission and Golden West tents by the
visiting degree team from Los Angeles,
the work being performed in a most im
pressive manner.
The new ritual is based upon the his
tory of the order, and it is said to be the
finest and most solemn that has ever been
prepared for any beneficiary organization.
The team, at the conclusion of the exemp
lification of the work, was congratulated
upon the faultless manner in which it was
done.
To-nieht the team will initiate eleven
candidates for San Francisco and Modin
tents.
Monday evening the local tents tendered
a reception in Union-square Hall to the Los
Angeles degree team, which, during the
convention, will exemplify the secret
work of the order. The team is composed
of C. A. Luckenbach, commander; John
Spiers, past commander; C. J. VValter,
lieutenant-commander; Fred Anthony,
priest; T. J. Harris and G. H. Berham,
assistant priests; Dr. R. E. O'Connell, Dr.
G. N. Van Orden, D. J. Buckley, Jamos
Patterson Jr., D. W. Bates and W. W.
Thompson, soldiers, and S. W. Hall and
J. C. Waddington, peasants.
The team appeared in the hall attired
in the costumes that were worn in the
days of the ancient Maccabees. They
were secured at a cost of $800. The team's
appearance was greeted by much applause
from the large number of ladies ana gen
tlemen who filled the ball. An exhibition
drill was given, which was attractive and
impressive. At the close the team was
treated to another round of applause.
After the drill the following programme
was carried out:
Overture, orchestra; welcome address
Charles J. King; response, C. A. Luckenbach;
Bong, Victoria Orr; recitation. Miss N. V Cor
ris; Lady Maccabees, Mrs. H. Cook; mandolin
trio, Mrs. A. Belasco, C. Me loco and F. Rodri
cuez; reading, F. L. Shaw; lancy dance. Miss
N. Lockwooa; barytone solo, William Nelson.
Then followed dancing, which was kept
up until midnight.
The membership of the order on the
31st of last August was 241,000, with tents
to the number of nearly 4450 in thirty
seven States and provinces in North
America.
There are seventy tents in California,
four of wnich, with a membership of nearly
500, all organized since last April, are
located in San Francisco. In the coun
ties in the immediate vicinity of this City
there are twenty-five tents. In the
southern part of the State there is a num
ber of tents, with a membership of 2000.
The tent located farthest north in this
State is the one at Sissons, Si.kiyou
County.
The headquarters of the order is at Port
Huron, Mich. The Maccabees organized
in 1878, and since 1881 have paid deatb and
disability benefits to the amount of
$6,806,720. P. D. Markey is the supreme
comnmnder and N. S. Bozton the supreme
record-keeper.
The order of the Knights of the Mac
cabees is founded on the history and tradi
tione of the Muccaoean dynasty, and it
has for its legend the exploits of Judas
Maccabeus, who ranks in ancient nistory
as one of the ablest military leaders. In
1878 a few gentlemen in London, Ont.,
familiar with the history of the ancient
Maccabees, conceived the ida of organic
ine a fraternal and beneficiary society
founded upon traditions of that band of
warriors, and it started out with the pur
pose or caring for the widows and orphans
of members. The order spread from
Canada to the United States, and grew
rapidly, and in 1881, competent business
men took hold and put it on a firmer
basis. It has been increasing healthily
and steadily ever since.
There is connected with this order an
auxiliary branch known as the Ladies of
tbe Maccabees, to which ladies only are
entitled to membership, and it is the only
order that is managed exclusively by
ladies.
TO AMUSE CHINESE
Scheme to Convert the Bella Union
Theater Into a Chinese
Playhouse.
The old Bella Union Theater on Kearny
street, near Vv'ashington, has been leased
for five years to a Chinese syndicate,
which will convert the old building into a
Chinese theater.
The work of conversion will at once be
proceeded with. It is the intention of the
managers to cater to American patronage
as well as to Chinese. The place will be
remodeled in accordance with the require
ments of the modern Chinese drama. It
is intended to give Americans the best
plays procurable in China, and an aug
mented orchestra will furnish the latest
and best compositions of the Chinese com
posers.
ASSAULT TO MURDER.
Joseph Kllollne Held to Answer Before
the Superior Conn.
The preliminary examination of Joseph
Kilcline, an ex-member of the Fire De
partment, on ttie charge of assault to com
mit murder, was held before Judge Conlan
yesterday.
The evidence showed what has already
been published. Kilcline, who had been
separated from bis wife, Eliza, met her on
the afternoon of August 31 in the house,
311 Jessie street. They had Â«ome words
and Kilcline pulled a revolver out of his
pocket and fired four shots at her, thr.ee of
them taking effect. It was thought at first
that she would die, but she gradually re
covered and was able to appear in court
yesterday and give her evidence.
The Judge held Kilrline to answer be
fore tbe Superior Court and fixed his
bonds at $3000.
GONE INTO INSOLVENCY,
Failure of the San Francisco
Furniture Manufacturing
Company.
A. J. Meadows Appointed Receiver
by the Superior Courtâ Assets
Exceed Liabilities.
The creditors of the San Francisco Fur
niture Manufacturing Company, one of
the heaviest concerns of the kind in San
Francisco, petitioned tne Superior Court
yesterday to have the company declared
insolvent, and the petition was granted,
A. J. Meadows being appointed receiver
pending the placing of the affairs of the
concern in the hands of an assignee.
Meadows repres 'nts some of the heaviest
creditors and filed the petition with the
County Clerk yesterday afternoon.
The liabilities of the company are placed
at $19,000, with assets at more than that
figure.
The neariest creditors are the Vermont
Marble Company, the Harrison-Jones and
Humboldt JLumber companies, Banborn,
Vail & Co., Whittier, Fuller & Co. and W
and J. Sloane & Co.
The assets consist of: Machinery
$13,000; stock, $11,000; goods ready for de
livery. $1500; unfinished contracts, $10,
-uuu*
The cause of the failure is understood to
be inability to collect on contracts and
litigation m which a large amount of
money is tied up. The creditors are per
fectly willing to have the business carried
on, believing that the firm can be put on a
safe footinjr, and pending the settlement
ol the affairs of the concern the receiver
and assignee will keep the factory in full
operation.
Receiver Meadows put up a $15,000 bond
yesterday to carry on the business. He
expects to pay 100 cenÂ»s on the dollar.

Mrs. L. Hecht is an enthusiastic Socialist,
ami at the last election she polled more
than half of the party vote. The candi
dates of the Fourth, Fifth and Sixtn Con
gressional districts nave secured more
than a sufficient number of signatures to
have their names placed on the ticket.
The same may be said of the candidates
of the Assembly districts, not over two or
three being behind in this respect.
Statistical authorities state that in the
United States this year fully 98,000 Social
ist votes wiil be polled. There will be
twenty tickets in the field in as many
States, whereas in 1892 there were only
seven States where they had out tickets.
The Socialists beiieve that they will poll
over 197.000 votes in this election in the
United States.
At an early hour yesterday morning thÂ«
State executive committee flung to the
breeze across Market street, near Fifth, a
beautiful Socialist banner, with the pic

Socialists' emblemâ the mechanic's arm
and uplifted hammer.

ings was the participation of the arnbi
! tious women of the league, who held a
j concurrent session in the committee-room
{ last night. Their session was called to

I appointed the following executive commit

REWARDED FOR THEIR MERIT.
Wiil Have the Honor of EiectiDg Two
United States Senators Dur
ing Their Term-
The Republican municipal convention,
which has just adjourned, has, in connec
tion with its excellent selection of citizens
who have been nominated for the various
offices, placed Defore the voters of the five
Senatorial districts the nam>esof nominees
for whom every voter in the district can
conscientiously Tote. Each, and every
man is in every, way well fitted for the
honorable position to which his fellow
citizens have called him. Following is a
brief account of the five nominees:
Hun. .John T. Dare.
The Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth As
sembly .districts, comprising the Nine
teenth Senatorial district, which covers
that extensine territory of the San Bruno
and South San Francisco section to the
county line of San Mateo, will be repre
sented in the Senate by the Hon. John T.
Bare. W ,
It would be a work of supererogation to
laud the many excellent traits of character
possessed by this gentleman, together with -
his fitness ior the high honor to which bis
fellow-citizens have called him, so well 1
known is he, not only in the district whif h
he will represent, but to the people of this
City in general.
John T. Dare is one of San Francisco's
self-made men. By hard study he suc
ceeded in acquiring such a knowledge of
law as to be admitted to the bar by the
| Supreme Court of this State. Since that
time he has successfully followed tne prac
tice of his profession.
Shortly after being admitted to the bar
he was appointed by the then District
Attorney, j. N. E. Wilson, as his first
'assistant, when he was recognized lor his
wonderful ability as a criminal prosecutor.
At the present time he is Prosecuting At
torney in Police Court 3, wheie.be has
given general satisfaction to the public.
As a public speaker he ranks high for
his oratorical ability. This qualification
has been the means of his engagement by
the Republican State Central Committee
during the campaign, -when public
speakers are sent forth to elucidate the
principles of the party in interior towns.'
With such gifts at its disposal San Fran
cisco will have a Senator from the Nine
teenth District that she will be proud to
acknowledge as one of her citizen:.
X. 11. Burnham. ,
The next State Senator from the Seven
teenth ' Senatorial District, which com
prises the Twenty-eighth and Twenty
ninth Assembly districts, will be N. H.
Burnbam. Mr. Burnbam is well and fa
vorably known in the district for which he
has received the nomination.
He was born October 5, 1851, and re
sides at 305 Fremont street. He came to
California in the year 1870 from Hartford,
Conn., where his parents were born, being
a scion of good old Connecticut stock. ' He
has resided in the district which he will
represent since 1870, and has been a Re
publican all nis life. He is a working
man, wharf-builder by trade, comes from
a workinKHieu's district, and is a man of
family.
During the past six years he has.been
engaged in the office of the State Harbor
Commissioners, and besides representing
the industrious and hard working com
munity in which he lives and whose inter
est be will represent in the State Senate,
he has a thorough knowledge of the wants
of the people of San Francisco. Coming
from one of the oldest American families
in the State of Connecticut he is Ameri
can enough for the most patriotic son of a
Revolutionary sire. Consequently he will
go into the Senate without being called
noon to explain when he became a nat
uralized citizen.
91. <(. Welch Jr.
The State Senator who will represent
the Twenty-third Senatorial District, com
prising the Thirty-first and Thirty-ninth
Assembly districts, will be M. J. Welch
Jr. He is a young man who has resided
in that district for the past ten years and
who has no apologies to offer lor the
political faith that is in him.
M. J. Welch Jr. first saw the light of day
in Springfield. Mass., thirty years ago, In
which place he spent his younger days
and until he arrived at the age of 14 years.
At the age of 13 years this young man
alter going through the regular routine of
the public State schools of Springfield
graduated from the grammar class and
with his mother started for California to :
join his father, who was engaged in mining
in this State. R^^P9HSKpi
On his arrival in San Francisco he
entered the St. Joseph College on Tenth
and Howard streets, where he studied
under Professor W. J. G. Williams. This
course finished his studies, which so well
fitted him for his battle in life. -
He at once entered the service of the
Gould railroad branch on this coast, and
so well adapted was he for the service
that he was advanced from one position to
.â¢mother of trust and responsibility, serv
ing as ticket, freight, traffic and passenger
agent through a number of years, and in
each and all positions giving entire satis
faction to liis employers.
In politics he has at all times espoused
the cause of the Republican party and has
been an active worker in the ranks oi the 1
banner Thirty-ninth Assembly District
Club for years.
In his capacity as a State Senator the
people, not only of his district but of San
Francisco, will have no apologies to offer
for their representative.
Edvrard I. Wolfe.
The Twenty-first DLtrlct, which com
prises the Thirty-seventh and Thirty
eighth Assembly districts, will De repre
sented in the Senate by that bright young
lawyer and orator, Edward 1. Wolfe, who
is well known not only in the district
which he will represent, but all over the
City.

England, and twenty-two years ago came
to San Francisco, where he has since re
sided. He is a graduate of the High
School of this City, and for nineteen years

trict. For eight years he was in the em
ploy of P. B. Cornwall, president of the
Black Diamond Coal Company. In 1886
he was a candidate for the State Senate on
the Republican ticket. It was the year ot
the Democratic tidal wave, and with the
rest was defeated, but in the district be
received the largest vote ever cast for a
Republican candidate. W. J. RudJick,
who was the only Republican City offi
cial, appointed him clerk of the probate
department of the Superior Court. After
that he served two years under Sheriff
Laumeister, having charge of the real
estate department. Then he was appointed

fifth Assembly districts, will be repre
sented in the State fcenate by one of the
native sons of the district.
Thomas \V. Chandler does not have to
leave the district wiiich he x represents for
sponsors. He was born in the midst of
bis own people thirty-three years ago and
resided right among his constituents dur
ing those many years. Consequently

he is known and respected. Having been
engaged as a shipping master for a num
ber 01 years he stands well witn the com
mercial community.

Francisco, and in ali the grades which he
went through his standard was always of
the highest order.

meiater's administration Mr. Chandler
held the position of bookkeeper, a place
which requiies a clear head and consider
able ability to successfully fill.
Besides being a native son of San Fran
cisco he has native sons and daughters,
who will in time become wortuy citizens
of this commonwealth.
Mr. Chandler is a member of the Repub
lican County Committee which position
he has held during the past six years, rep
resenting his district with cure aud intel
ligence for the ,good or the party. His
present promotion is made by his fellow
Republicans on the ground ot ability and
an a reward' for his faithfulness to their
interests.
DELINQUENT COLLECTOR
Officers Outside of San Francisco
Who Failed to Perform
a Duty.
Governor Budd Wants to Know Why
Tax-Takers Have Not Levied on
Certificate Transfers.
Governor 15udd 13 going after the Tax
Collectors of the counties outside of San
Francisco, and intends to ascertain why
they have neglected to perform a duty im
posed upon them by law.
"The neglect." said the Governor, "is a
failure to collect a tax of 10 cents on each
transfer of a certificate of mining stock in
this Stute. The money collected goes into
a fund for the maintenance ot the Califor
nia State Mining Bureau. Mr. Crawford,
the State Mineralogist, called ruy atten
tion to the fact a few days since, and I re
ferred him to the Attorney-General, and 1
understand the tew requiring the collec
tion has never been repealed."
"It is only in San Francisco that the tax
on transfers of certificates of ruining shares
has been collected," said Henry S. Dur
den, secreiary of the board of trustees of
the California State Mining Bureau.
"That tax lias been a yearly revenue to
the bureau of from $4500 to ?50tK), while
from the other counties the aggregate of
the revenue has been bui $20 in sixteen
years.
"Thiadepartment has written repeatedly
to the Tax Collectors of the several counties
and every one of them has ignored the
matter except the San Francisco Collector.
1 am satisfied that that neglect has been
kd annual loss to this department of
$1000. I understand that the reaaoii that
the interior people have reiusecl to attend
to this matter is thai they claim that there
is no penalty in the law tit failure to col
lect the tax. But it seems to me that this
law is as mandatory as any other, and
now that the Governor has taken hold of
the matter he will make them understand
that there is a penalty in case they fail to
perform a duty required by law.
"It is a reniarkabie lact," continued the
secretary, "that most of tlie tax is col
lected from certificates to mining com
panies located on the Comstock, in Ne
vada."

In Gcod Humor and a Chic

neys Ruled.
ENJOYED THE LEGAL TILTS.
In the Main the Young Heiress Cor
roborated Her Sister's Deposition
of Ihe Previous Day.
Miss Virginia Fair, looking as blithe
and lissome and glad as a debutante,
dressed In a picturesque suit of gray,
topped with a "picture hat" with sweep
ing black feathers, added a small volume
MISS VIRGINIA FAIR as She Appeared While Giving Her
Testimony Yesterday.
to the literature of the Fair litigation yes
terday.
Under the stress of many questions and
smajl ventilation in the offices of Notary
Phillips the lady, when the afternoon was I
growing old, took oft her gray jacket and |
revealed a very chic waist of light blue
trimmed with white lace and black rib
bons. Despite her illness of the day be
fore, she was in the very best of humor
and treated the wrangling of the attorneys
over their abstruse technicalities as a
thing to be thoroughly enjoyed.
Her sister, Mrs. Oelrichs, was present
during the entire day and was also much
interested in the proceedings, although |
they developed nothing of moment. Srfe
introduced a costume that has been seen
only once during her long series of ap
pearances in the long series of cases and
depositions.
Miss Fair's depositions yesterday. were
given in the twin suits in ejectment brought
by Mrs. Craven under her deeds for the
Mission aud the PinÂ« street properties.
Wnat she said was very much what Mrs.
Oeirichs had Mid the day before and a
repetition of what she herself had said in
previous depositions. She remembered
that her father bad said to tier also that
he was not married and that he never in
tended to marry, because of his childrenâ
that he wished all his estate to go to
them.
The inquiry was conducted by F. 8.
Brit tain in the absence of Mr. Delmas, the
latter beine still engaged at San Jose.
In the afternoon W. W. Foote came to
Mr. Brittain's support and a stipulation
was entered into by which the deposition
in the case of Craven against Fair might
be used in the case of Craven against
Oelrichs, the contention being identical in
each case, except that one is for the Mis
sion and the other the Sausome street
property.
The feature of the day's proceedings was
the stand taken by the attorneys for the
sisters. They began objecting early in
the day and kept it up, instructing- the
witness not to answer "on advice of coun
sel," and the witness followed the advice
to the letter in each instance and refused
to answer "on advice of counsel." . .
This was carried to such length- that
Brittain asked, finally: "Will you answer
any more questions having ,a f proper
relevancy to this issue?"
The witness was advised not 1 to answer
on advice of counsel â "and as it implied
the necessity, of the witness to judge of the
relevancy of whatever questions might be
asked." >.
Brittain then asked if she was willing to
go on with her deposition.
The witness looked inquiringly at Mr.
Lloyd and Mr. Wheeler. They made no
sign in this last extremity, aud sue, laugn
ing, said she "didn't know what to say."
Â» Lloyd then gave the cue by declaring
that they were willing that the witness
should answer any questions proper to the
issue when put, but that they were op
posed to any further "fishing excursion"
in this matter.
Brittain then said he had finished. Mr.
Foote asked leave to put a few questions,
saying he thought he could get along with
the witness all ritrht. He was allowed to
ask two or three questions that had already
been asked, but the moment he began to
touch upon the reasons why Miss Fair had
changed her mind about the pencil will
and if she had not acted upon counsel's
advice, objection followed objection and
he, too, was compelled to give it up. ->^
Miss Fair, in answer to Brittain's ques
tions, bad said th.it she had examined the
photographic cooies of the deed for the
Sansome-street property and it apoeared
to her tnat the body of the instrument
was written by her father.
Then Brittain askea if she had examined
it with a view of comparing the writing in
the body of the document with that of the
signature.
She said she had examined both and it
looked like her father's writing.
Here Wheeler made a demand that the
document be produced before they would
go on witn the cross-examination.
Brittain said the paper was not in their
keeping and they could not produce it at
that time. They would produce it at a
proper time.
"We want it now or at the time we
begin cross-examination. Will the coun
sel tell us what he thinks is a proper
tirae?"
"This proceeding is for the taking of the
deposition of the witness and not for giv
ing legal opinions," said Brittain.
"In other words, we can't and won't
produce it at this time," said Foote,
sharply.
"Then we refuse to go on with the
cross-examination at this time," said
Wheeler.
From that point on the objections fol
lowed fast and faster to the questions put.
JNJiss Fair will read and sign her deposi
j tion this morning.
NO RELIEF AT LAW.
Orange County Must Look for Re
imbursement to the Legisla
ture of the State.
in Department 1 of the Supreme Court
a decision was rendered on Monday affirm
ing tne judgment of the lower tribunal in
tue case of Orange County against Los An
geles County.
The action was brought to recover
$1903 70, alleged to be Orange County's
proportion of $19,032 43 received from the
State as repayment of money expended by
Los Angeles County in aiding indigent old
persons (luring tne interval between tne
30th of June, 1883, and the 11th of March,
When Orange County was created
in 1S>!) a commission was appointed to ad
just the respective liabilities of the two
counties. This commission made s. care
ful investigation into the financial status
of the case, but omitted to note the State
aid due and owing to Los Angeles for the
care of the aged poor.
Orange County claimed a little over a
tentn of the amount as its share. This
claim was disallowed by the Los Angeles
Supervisors, and Orange County brought
the matter into court.
While recognizing the justice of the
claim, the Supreme Court says:
"Where a county is divided, the rule for
the division and apportionment of the
debts and property between such county
and detached territory belongs exclusively
to the Legislature and not to the courts.
In performing their duties the Commis
sioners doubtless intended to make the
division a3 required; and if they failed to
do so, the failure arose through mistake.
The mistake was one, however, which in
our opinion can be corrected by legisla
tive action only, and not by the courts.
The courts are without authority to ad
just matters of this character between
counties."

The public is cordially invited to attend the
laying of the cornerstone of the Maria Kip

will be entirely choral, ana the music will be
led by the choir of Grace Church. Cars of the

BRODERICK HAS
REFUSED TO SIGN
No Money for Many City
Employes This
Month.
The Municipal Government
Said to Be in Serious
Danger.
TO BE TAKEN TO THE COURTS.
Mandamus Proceedings Will Be
B gun Against the Auditor
To-Day.
"With the first of thb month and accom
panying collection day staring them in the
face, the deputies in the offices of the
Sheriff, County Clerk, Coroner, District
Attorney, Assessor and Recorder are on
the horns of a dilemma, for Auditor Brod
erick has decided that their warrants are
not to be signed, because he is uncertain
as to the meaning of certain clauses of the
county government act.
A representative of the Sheriff's office
called at the Auditor's office yesterday to
make a formal demand for the warrants of
his department, tiiough the time for de
livery is not until to-day.
He was told that the Sheriff's own war
rant would be ready for delivery to-day,
but that the deputies wouid receive no
money.
Tii is information caused consternation
in the Sheriff's < ffice. and as the news of ]
the Auditor's hold-up of the City povern- :
mum spread through the hall other de- j
partments sent to the Auditor for infor
mation, and alt received the same satisfac
tion â no money, except for the heads of â 
the departments mentioned.
The information did not come from the |
Auditor direct, for that official has been
practically invisible for several days pa-t,
on the understanding that he is preparing
a statement of his position in the matter,
but was leaned from conversations with
subordinates about tha office.
Then the wraih of tue "deps" broke
loose, and if Mr. Brodenck had heard all
of the uncomplimentary things that were
said about him be would probably have
felt far from pleased.
If to-day brings no change in the situa
tion mandamus proceedings will undoubt
edly be be^un to compel Mr. Broderick to
sign the warrants. "Otherwise the City
employes must suffer. .
Tue Auditor says he is acting in accord
ance with the advice of his attorney, Gar- \
ret McEnerney, who beiieves that, until j
the Supreme Court should determine the
question whether the county government
act requires officers in cities of the first
class to pay their clerks out o:' their sala
ries and lees he would possibly incur a
serious liability by auditing the demands.
The question will not be settled until the
petition for a rehearing of vhe tenure-of
olnce case shall be pa>?od upon.
AFTER THE HUNTERS.
The Cordelia Gun Club Will Arrest All
AVho Trespass on Its I'reaerve.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
will meet oa Tuesday evening, October 6,
at Knights of the Red Branch Hall,
specially for the purpose of discussing the
question of game preserves. According to
the decision as recently rendered by the
Supreme Court, it would appear that the
clubs which hava leased large tracts of
marsh land in Solano County are now in a
position to defend themselves against
trespassers. At any rate, the Cordelia
Club is determined to punish all hunters
who enter upon its preserve, and with this
object in view a small army of keepers
will be stationed on the Buiann marshes
on the opening day of the same-shooting
season, October 15, to assist the officers of
the iaw in making arrests of burners who
refuse to leave the premises when or
dered to decamp.
An attorney who is well known among
sportsmen said yesterday that according
to the decision rendered by the Supreme
Court the clubs which have leased lands
must fence them properly before they can
cause the arrest ot trespassers. It is said
that there are many acres of leased marsh
lands near Suisun which are not in
closed.
On Sundey next the tug Vigilant will
take the Knights of St. Patrick aud their
friends to the Farallon Islands, where the
annual fishing excursion of the Knights
wiil be held. D. E. Conaon, C. J. Me-
Glynn, F. McCormick and John Purceil
are on the committee of arrangements.
Five hundred Jive pigeons will be taken
from this City on Friday morning to San
Bruno, where the State Sportmen's Asso
ciation will hold its annual tournament.
A Peddler's Grievance.
Louis Abrahams, a peddler living at 1403
Devisadero street, swore to a complaint in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday charging Sig
rnund Levi with potty larceny. ADrahiims has
been keeping his horse and wagon in Levi"s
mother's barn at 1914 Ellis street, and he al
leges that Levi on Monday sold the horse for
(28 without his authority.

NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 29 â Tl.ere was a
slight recession in prices at the opening of busi
ness a the stork Exchange this morning owing
to the receipt of lower quotation < irom 1 on<lon
and the expectation that the Chicago, Burl n ton

Her tombstone, erected by th- bereaved
husband, has inscribed upon it, after
the customary birth and death announce
ments, the scrintural quotation: "There
remaineth therefore a rest unto the peo
ple of God."â Judge.

IS IN HIS WILL
The Late I)r. E. H. Pardee's
Testament Filed for
Probate.
Provision Made Against Any
Attempt to Alter Decedent's
Wishes.
ALL ABSOLVED FROM SECRECY
Ample Provision Is Made for the
Widow, Son and Daughter of
the Deceased.
Oakland Office San Feancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 29. !
The will of the late Dr. E. H. Pardee,
which was filed for probate to-day, is typi
cal of the man vrho made it. Concise as
to details, clear as to language ana intent,
absolutely without any secrecy &nd with
a clause that it is hoped will make a con
test improbable the document is a reflex
of the character of the dead citizen.
The estate is valued at about $350,000 and
each parcel of realty and the personal
estate is accurately described.
The property left to the widow com
prises the Arcata House, valued at $75,000,
and a home tout is to be pmronased for
her at a price not to exceed $10, I XX).
Miss Nellie Pardee is given the Pardee
House on Telegraph avenue, worth $60,
-000; a lot on San Pablo avenue, valued at
$2500, and the balance of the estate is left
to Dr. G. C. Pardee.
The first clause in the long Trill is as fol
lows:
All the estate of every kind and nature, real,
personal and mixed, of which I urn seized and
possessed or to which I may be in any way en
titled, is my separate properly, nearly all j
thereof having been acquireii by me before
my marriage with my wile, E. 3. Pardee, and
the remninder is the income acd proceeds de
rived since my said marriage :roni the prop
erty I theretofore had.
In order to make a contest improbable
the decedent says:
If any one or more of the persons mentioned
and reierred to in this my will contests or
enters into litigation with respect to my will
or any provisions of the same, or if any court
attempts to vacate or set eside the provisions
thereof, or any of them, eithir directly or in
directly, then and in that case, all the pro
visions of this my will in favor of the person
or persons making such litigsrion thall be re
voked, annulled and set aside, and such per
son or persons shall take no part or portion of
the said property or estate; and as to any
legacies which may have been provided for or
given to such person or persons, the same shall j
be treated as lapsed legacies.
The late Dr. Pardee evidently had noth
ing to keep from the public regarding his
long and useful life, for he absolves all
physicians and attorneys from the embargo
of confidence by the foliowinc clause:
I hereby order and direct that all physicians
who have attended or may attend me at any
time as such physicians, and all attornevs-at
law with whom i have consulted or may con
sult about my business affairs or about my will
and testament, shall have the right, and 1
hereby direct them and each 0/ tioin, 10 tes
tify as to any matter or tbiug which they may j
know in reference to me or my property or j
affairs, or as to my mental condition. And 1 1
hereby absolve them aud each of them from
all restrictions as to privileged communica
tions or relations, and they and each of them \
may freely speak and testily fully without t
reservation.
The will consists of ten sheets, three of !
wnich are a coiiicii providing for the home i
for the widow and daughter. George j
Cooper Pardee, Timothy Guy Phelps and !
E. B. Mastick are named as executors.
There are several small legacies ieft to
acquaintances and relatives as follows:
To his sister, Jane, $1000; to his brother,
Joel, $500; to Gilbert B. Pardee, $500; to j
Coraine Rounds, $500; 10 Henry fardee '<
$500; to Gilbert Henry, $500; to H."E. Henry, i

to C. L. Pardee, $1000; to Andrew Pardee,
$500; to Lucy Pardee (wife of C. L. Pardee),
$250; to Mrs. Barnum (wife of Gorman Bar

The widow and son are directed to pay
decedent's brother, WilJiam, $100 each '
every November.

Taxes Will Be Delayed.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 29.â The City
Tax Collector is considerably worried over
the tax levy. The charter provides that
the Council "shall on or before the first
Monday in October of each year, by or
dinance, fix the tax rate to be levied," etc.,
and under the general law taxes shall be
due and payable on the first Monday in
October.
The present condition of affairs makes
it impossible that the terras of either can
be complied with, for tlie tax-levy ordi
nance is now being printed and will not
be ready until Tuesday next when it is as
sured that Mayor Davie will veto it. As
to its fate all is speculation as no one
knows how Councilman Heitman will vote

Wm. McKinley.
Typical of Republicanism's
Watchful Eye and Strength

AN ENCOURAGING PROPHECY.
The Noble Bird Carries the Greetings

Oakland Office Sah Francisco Call,*

was a beautiful live specimen of the Cali

the hills north of Berkeley.
The noble bird was bought by Senator
Eli S. Denison, who at once conceived the
idea of sending it to the next President as
a symbol of California's fidelity to Repub

friend of Major McKinley and is making a
very aggressive campaign. He has already
given away about 15,000 buttons to bona
tide Republicans.
When the unique gift was at the depot,
tagged "To William McKinley, Canton,
Ohio," it created much interest and the
Senator was required to tell of its history
several times.
This evening Senator Denison sent the
following letter to Major McKinley:
Major William, McKinley, Canton, OhioâTiz
fpected Sir: Undersigned sends you this day a
live American Eagle (captured in the hills of
Berkeley) as a most worthy emblematical mas
cot in this patriotic campaign for protection,
prosperity and sound money.
He bears you our greetings from Califor
nia and fairly illustrates the watchful eye,
strength of purpose, determined will and un
conquerable spirit that animates tne Republi
can party of this distant State, and who are in
spired not alone by your past enviable record,
but the dignified and consistent position you
so ably maintain to-day as our esteemed and
honored Presidential candidate.
Assuring you, my dear sir, of our enthusias
tic support, I am, yours, very respectfully,
E. B. Denison,
State Senator, Twenty - sixth District, Cali
fornia.
Senator Denison has also sent a letter to
a lriend at Canton, asking him to meet the
eagle and have the cage elegantly deco
rated with the National colors before it is
presented to Mr. McKinley.

clothes or bad some organic trouble.
The Cantennial Hotel was visited by bur
glars last night, the rooms of two of the
lodgers being entered. Mr. Beardsley had be
tween $15 and $20 stolen from him, besides a
cold w&tch. In another room the intruders
secured about $1 50.
At the inquest on the body of J. B. Mathisen,
the San Francisco architect, who hanged him
self in Berkeley Saturday night, no new facts
were discovered, and the jury returned a ver
dict of suicide by strangulation.
Ixro Chinese Suspects.
United States Marshal BaMwin received a
letter from Stockton yesterday which may be
the means of sending two Mongols back 10
their native land. The writer, who signs him
self "W. A. T., Chinese Court Interpreter,"
says there are two Chinese : working at the
Capitol Hotel in that city who are illegally in
the country. 'â¢ The names of the suspected
Chinese are Wong Yet and Wong Cheoni?. The
letter has been placed in the. hands of Col
lector Wise for investigation.

HUFF WRONGLY CHARGED.
The Ex-United States Court Chlneie In
terpreter Hhi Been Fully
Exonerated.
Harry Huff, for years United States
Chinese interpreter, and who was dis
missed some months ago for alleged
crookedness, has succeeded in clearing
nimself. In the recent developments more
evidence has been brought to light tend
ing to snow the duplicity of the recently
convicted Chinese Inspector, Dick Wil
liams.
Huff was formerly Chinese interpreter
for the United States District Attorney.
He was tnoroughly competent and gave
general satisfaction. In some way he
brought down on his head the wrath of
Dick Wiliiams, who later preferred
charges against nim for accepting bribes
from Chinese.
One day Williams informed the District
Attorney that he had positive knowledge
that at a certain time Huff would go to the
room of a Chinese woman in order to ac
cept a bribe. In fact, so Williams de
clared, it was arranged that the latter
should accompany the interpreter in order
to receive the money. Aciing upon the
information given by Williams, a con
fidential officer of the Government was
directed to secrete himself in the room of
the Chinese woman that evidence might
be secured upon which to base the dis
missal of Huff. Accordingly, Williams led
the way to the woman's room, and event
ually, as he had predicted. Huff appeared
and was paid a sum of money by the
Chinese woman. Of course, all the con
versation took place in Chinese.
This evidence seemed conclusive proof
of guilt, and Huff's dismissal was accord
ingly ordered by the department at Wash
ington. Judgo Foote has recently learned
that the money paid by the women to
Huff was a just debt.
The authorities at Washington nave
been notified of this newly discovered evi
dence in Huff's favor, and his reinstate
ment is looked for.
BARRING OUT THE PRESS
The Board of Health Closes the
Receiving Hospital
to It.
Supervisors Asked to Prohibit Ex
pectoratiog on the Streets
and in Cars.
The Board of Health at a special meet
ing held yesterday solemnly decreed that
the Receiving Hospital in future is to be
closed to the reporters and artists of news
papers, because the Interviewing and
sketching of patients is contrary to the
sacred ethics of the medical profession.
The Police Surgeon was warned that
any official or employe violating this rule
would De summarily dismissed. In view
of the scandals that have arisen during
other administrations regarding the treat
ment of patients and their belongings this
action would seem somewhat risky.
At the suggestion of Superintendent 8.
ii. McLenegan of the San Francisco and
San Mateo electric line the following reso
lution was passed:
Retolved, That the attorney of the Board oi
Health be requested to Immediately prepare
and have passed by the Board of Supervisors
of this City b proper ordinance for the preven
tion of expectoration on the sidewalks or In
buildiugs or in any public conveyances in this
City, and that such buildiugs and conveyances
should be provided with proper receptacles
for such expectorations.
Mr. KeinÃtein will prepare a communi
cation to the board at once.
At a meeting of the board held August
11, 1896, with those furnishing milk for
this City, and with the health officers of
San Mateo ami Santa Clara counties, Oak
land and Berkeley, it was stated that it
had been and was impossible for those
supplying milk for the City to comply
with the order of June 25, 1896, providing
for the quarantining of all milk from
cows that had not been tested by the
United States tuberculine test. This state
of affairs led to the passage of the follow
inc:
Resolved, That the operation of so much of
our order of the 25th of June. 189(5, as re
quires on and after Octobor 1, 1896, the quar
antining of milk from cows not so as above
teFted be postponed until the further order of
this board in fo far only, however, as concerns
i such rifMons, firms or corporations supplying
I milk for this City, as shall daily submit such
I supply of milk lor inspection at the most con-
I venient inspection station of the four open
public food iuspection stations, as soon as such
stations are ready for operation, and shall
comply further with all rules and regulations
of this City, and the laws of this State.
John Cameron was appointed Bakery
Inspector at a salary of $75 per month,
and John Loane Health Inspector at $100
per month.
COMING AT LAST.
Anarchists In New York Are Dally Ex
pecting Â£<oulse Michel.
The anarchists are all rejoicing, because
news has arrived that Louise Michel is
sailing from England for America.
John Most and the other anarchist lead
ers in New York are preparing to deify
her, and it goes without eaying that she
will make a lecturing tour. Whoever pays
the expenses of her trip it is not likely
that the French anarchist will be less suc
ceEsfui in making dollars and converts
than other famous anarchists of other na
tionalities who have before visited this
country.
John Most has received the following
circular, signed by Pietro Gori and Fran
cis Marat:
"We have the pleasure of announcing
that in the interests of the cause, we nave
succeeded in persuading our intrepid
Louise Michel to make a tour in America.
She has consented the more willingly, as
sbe is convinced that a propaganda is more
than ever necessary just at present. She
will be accompanied by her inseparable
friend, Charlotte Vanvllie, who could not
possibly leave her, both on account of
Louise Michel's advanced age, and also
because of the care she will need during
her long and fatiguing journey."
Gori's manifesto concludes by begging
his friends in America to contribute to the
cause, and by stating that Louise Micbel's
departure is fixed for the end of Septem
ber. According to L'ltalia, John Most
has not himself been informed of the
exact day of the famous anarchist's arri
val, but he is expecting her in the course
of next week.
ALL DETAILS ARRANGED.
Sacred Heart Parish Fair to Open To-
Morrow Kvenlng.
The ladies in charge of details for the
bazaar in aid of the new Sacred Heart
Church have their preparatory work all
completed. The fair will be held in the
National Guard Armory, corner of Page
and Gough streets, and will open with
auspicious ceremonies to-morrow evening
at 8 o'clock.
Each evening a select programme will
be presented by the ladies of tne respective
booths, and special pains will be taken to
entertain those who will attend.
The saber contest for the most popular
commissioned officer of the League of the
Cross Cadets, under the direction of Mrs.
D. F. Ragan, is developing much interest
amons the young officers of the regiment,
and promises to prove one of the most
attractive features of the fair.
FOUGHT PIRATES
ON THE HIGH SEAS
H. S. Eastham, a Survivor
of the Perry Ex
pedition.
Served as a Seaman Under
Commodore Perry in
1853-55
DISABLED IN A BATTLE.
Says He Is the Only Survivor of the
Expedition on the Pacific
Coast.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 29.â Henry 8.
Eastham, who lives on Kittredge street,
claims to be the only survivor on the
Pacific Coast of the famous Ferry eipedi-
H. S. EASTHAM, the Veteran Survivor of the Perry Expedition.
tion to Japan in 1858. Eastham is now
65 years old, and is in a disabled condi
tion, having received permanent bodily
injuries while serving on board the Mis
sissippi, which was the flagship of Com
modore Perry during the expedition.
He asked the Government for a pension
during the first part of Cleveland's second
administration, end receiving no reply
took measures again to-day to reach the
President. This time he will do h*s work
through Senator Perkins.
Eastham claims to be veryjmnch in need
of the asked-for assistance and says that
he can furnish ample proof of his right to
a Government stipend.
His life while on the expedition was
fnu of interesting incidents. A fleet of
ten ships under Commodore Perry was
sent to Japan in 1853 for the purpose of
protecting American interests there and
of attempting to open the Japanese ports
to the world.
Part of the fleet spent the whole time
fighting pirates on the high seas, and it
was while serving as an ordinary seaman
in one of these engagements tv at Eastham
received his injuries.
Many of his comrades died on account
of the unhealthy climate, while others
were killed by the guns of the enemy.
Eastham holds his honorable discbarge
papers from Captain McDongal. dated
1855. He says that a William Nichols,
who died in Berkeley last year, was one of
the party. Nichols received $500 and 160
acres of land from the Government as a
pension, and Eastham says that his rea
sons for asking a similar allowance are
even more ureent and weighty than those
which Nichols offered.
He is one of the best known citizens of
the college town, having lived there for
the past twelve years. He is now staying
with his only sister and is engaged in do
ing odd jobs about town, not being phy
sically able to perform hard, manual la
bor.
Kenney Defeated.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 29.â The Town
Trustees last night finally defeated a mo
tion to appoint James Kenney Fire Chief
of Berkeley. Kenney was nominated by
the Columbia Fire Company and received
the indorsement of all companies except
those of South Berkeley, but owing to the
vigorous opposition of the soutb-end com
panies the Trustees refused to appoint
him.
Last night Trustee Martin moved that
Mr. Kenney be appointed Fire Chief. The
motion was seconded by Trustee Durrell,
but only received the votes of Martin,
Durrell and Richards and was therefore
defeated.
Last night's rote will probably settle the
Fire Chief question for some time. The
matter may be brought up some iqonths
from now when all ill feeling resulting
from the late contest has died out, but
at present Berkeley will have to do with
out a Fire Chief.
The I-icense Ordinance.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 29.â The Town
Trustees last night made an important
amendment in the new license ordinance.
Trustee Martin vigorously objected to the
new law on account of the hardship which
he declared it would impose upon peddlers.
An amendment was finally adopted al
lowing peddlers to do business for a license
of $30 per quarter. The cbange is highly
unsatisfactory to the Merchants' Protec
tive Association, which secured the pas
sage of the new law, as it is regarded as a
loophole for outside merchants.
Football Team.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept, 27.â The Uni
versity football team that will play against
the Reliance Club next Saturday is
as follows: Right end, Hopper;
right tackle, Hynes; right guard,
Griesberg; center, Birdsell; left guard,
Ludlow; left tackle, Simpson; left end,
Craig; left half. Hall; left end, Sherman;
quarterback, Kennedy; fullback, Captain
Kansome. Ransome, Sherman and Ken
nedy are the only ones of this team who
were on the Varsity eleven last year.

JAMES CASE TO PREACH.
| He Gives Up a Fine Vusiness Position
to Kilter the Ministry.
James Case, son of Rev. Dr. Case of the
Howard-street M. E. Church, has decided
to give up his business and go into the
ministry.
For a number of years, ever since he
was 13 years of age, in fact, James Case
has always identified himself with the
work of the church of which his father
happened to be pastor. At the Howard
street church be has been the life and soul
of all movements among the young peo
ple, and he has always been a popular as
well as an energetic leader. The news of
his adopting the ministry as a profession
will be a surprise to many of his friends
and to his business associates, as Mr. Case
holds a lucrative position in the Royal
Insurance Company and is considered to
have excellent prospects in the business
world. The fact is, however, that he has
felt drawn toward the ministry for many
years, but he has never been moved to
consider that he had a call till the recent
conference at Pacific Grove. After hear
ing the addresses, he was moved to look
upon the pastorate as his true vocation
and at once made arrangements to give
up his business and devote his life to
preaching the Gospel.
Mr. Case intends to take up the regular
conference studies. He will have to be
two or three years iii conference before
being ordained, and till then will occupy
the position of supply preacher under the
conference. He has already been ap
pointed to preach at Madison and Guindo,
in Sonoma County. To-ni>;ht a reception
will be given at Howard-street church, to
give farewell to James Case and to cele
brate the reappointment of Rev. Dr.
Case. This will be the last year of Dr.
Case's ministry with his present flock, as
he is now entering the fifth year of his
pastorate at the Howard-street church.
James Case is 30 years of age. His wife
was the sister of Mrs. Rollo V. Watt, but
he was left a widower four years ago.

WANTED AN ACCOUNTING,
Jacob Levy Accused of Keeping
His Sister's Money and
Jewelry.
Another Action Growing Out of tbe
Collapse of tbe Building on
Fifth Street.
An action was begun yesterday in the !
Superior Court that is one of several grow- j
ing out of the accident on Fifth street and j
Mint avenue, where a four-story building |
collapsed several months ago. The parties
in the last suit are J. D. Sullivan, attorney
for the Public Administrator, and
Jacob Levy, a tailor, at 284 Stevenson
street, in which the former seeks to obtain
$1300 from tne latter.
Levy is the brother of Mrs. Ernestine
Silverstein, the aged woman who was pass
ing along Mint avenue when the building
went down. She was killed beneath the
ruins. In her pocket was a bankbook
Knowing nearly $1000 on deposit in the
German BanK, the money and book stand
ing in tbe names of Mrs. Ernestine Silver
btein and Jacob Levy. The Coroner
handed the book over to Levy, who soon
after drew out $911 70.
The estate of the deceased passed into
the bands of the Public Administrator,
who at. once made an inventory of the
property owned by the old woman. Be
sides the bank account it was found that
there was a quantity of clothing, a dia
mond ring, a plain gold ring, another with
a pearl setting and a watch, all of which I
had been in the hands of Levy, who to
all accounts still holds the property.
The heirs of tbe estate are Mrs. Silver
stein's son and daughter, L. Silverstein
and Mrs. Hannah Silverstein Rice, who j
live in Sacramento.. From the daughter i
the Public Administrator learned that all !
of tbe money appearing in the bankbook j
mentioned was obtained from beneliciary i
societies, of which Mrs. Silverstein s bus- j
oand was a member. Mrs. Silverstein's
reason for having the name of her brother
Levy on the book was because she was in
very poor health and he could draw money
for her whenever she wanted any. The
old woman's children desired to obtain
their mother's property, but the uncle
iailed to hand the same over to them.
About that time the children caused |
Carroll Cook to begin a suit against the j
contractors and owners of the collapsed '
building to recover $50,000 damages for j
their mother's death. The attorney has
never been able to serve the papers upon
the defendants. Attorney Cook called the
attention of Probate Judge Coffey, who :
caused Levy to be brought before him and |
explain why he took his sister's money
out of the bank and failed to account for
the same. Levy said ti.at he spent the I
money for luneral expenses. This ex- i
plana'tion is evidently not satisfactory to I
the children or to Public Administrator
Freese, who now seeks to recover, not only
the money but the other property, the
total value of which is placed at $1300.
The children propose to contest the action I
of the uncle to the bitter end.
THE PRESBYTERY CLOSES.
Rev. G. D. B. Stewart Is Elected
Moderator for the Com
ing Term.
Seminary Student H. F. Marshall's
Case Goes Over to tbe De
cemb.T Meeting.
Rev. G. D, B. Stewart, the new moder
ator of the San Francisco Presbytery,
called the synod to order iv the Olivet
â¢ Presbyterian Church at th<j Potrero yester
day morning at 9 o'clock. After the de
votional exercises the members took up
the routine business of the synod, which
occupied their attention till the noon
hour, when they partook of a bountiful
lunch provided by the ladies of Olivet
Church in the assembly-room.
In the afternoon session the following
resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That the committee of home mis
sions be further instructed that, in accordance
with the action of August 4, the corner lot in
Richmond district be disposed of to pur
chasers and with the proceeds a lot be ob
tained for the establishmei. t of a Presbyterian
church in Holly Park district, and if there is
any money over to put it into a suitable
building for the same purpose on that lot.
In the report of delinquencies in the as
sessment to the synod the Chinese church
was marked short $5 50 and Olivet Church
$15. On motion this indebtedness was
conceled. Lebanon Presbyterian Church
"was reported to be delinquent $19 30. The
chairman of the finance committee was
directed to request the pastor, Rev. Donaid
Ro3S, to report the reason of the de
linquency.
Moderator Stewart vacated the chair and
read the report of the committee on educa
tion. It dealt largely with matters per
taining to the Presbyterian Theological
Seminary, and recommended that the
Christian Endeavor Society of the church
e-tablish several scholarships and other
wise turn its endeavors more toward that
institution of learning. The report also
recommended for adoption a resolution
forbidding students in their first and mid
dle years to preach, and that feeble
churches be supplied from the class of
senior students.
The mention of the seminary brought np
the name of a student that everybody
was thinking of but as yet no one had ut
tered. Finally Mr. Thompson arose and
asked if H. F. Marshall was connected
with the institution and receiving aid
therefrom, and if it was the intention of
the synod to drop his name from the roll
of membership.
Dr. Minton of the seminary stated that
Marshall was still a student, but was not
receiving any aid whatever of a financial
nature.
This particular question got away from
the debaters, and that of forbidding the
lower classes to preach was taken up. Mr.
Thompson brought the subject back for
consideration, but upon motion it went
over till the December meeting.
It was learned from one of the ministers
present that the presbytery is unequivo
cally not in favor of keeping Marshall on
the rolis of the seminary. No charges
will be brought against him at present.
The presbytery adjourned to meet Octo
ber 16 at Calvary Presbyterian Church
corner of Geary and Powell streets.
MRS. MARTIN'S GOWNS.
The I,Â»dy of thÂ« Will Case to Make
Her Debut.
Mrs. John F. Martiu is at last about to
make her long-talked-of theatrical debut.
She has decided to appear in an emotional
drama, "Madame de Fontanges," adapted
from the French by Thomas Taylor, and
she has made up a company of her own
in New York under the management of F.
W. Bon son.
Just to try her wings Mrs. Martin is go
ing out for a week with her company in
New York State . She says that the dreÃses
she has purchased are something gorgeous
to behold. "In the first act," says Mrs.
Martin, "I appear as I enter in a most
gorgeous white moire and satin striped.
It is made in the style of the first empire.
The three seams up tbe front are corded
With goldâ a Jong empire train of plain
White satin; the waist has a simple pearl
hÂ«nd holding the dress by the shoulders.
The entim front and train are trimmed
with velvet flowers made to represent the
natural wildflowers of California. I refer
to the esehscholtzia. I carry California
colors in every costume. Tbe second and
third acts I wear a white point lace robe
over eschscholtzia-colored silt; the under
flounce is trimmed daintily with flowers
made to resemble tha California violets.
"Oh, but my dress in the last act is the
most gorgeous piece of coloring I have
ever seen. It is in the most intense shade
of eschschoiizia, almost an orange. The
close-fitting Drincess under-dross is of the
same shade of velvet as the court train
and is trimmed with magnificent ousse
menterie in amber and jet. The "lone,
sweeping court train is a most rnagnih
cent brocade i stripe in escbscholizio and
black stripe, alternated with the plain
esehscholtzia stripe of satin. The color is
so vivid that I never tire of looking at it.
"My wrap which I wear in the second
net is a confection of chamois-colored
cloth made in empire style, with an im
mense revere of a very magnificent bro
caded velvet in mauve and gold and
white."
Mrs. Martin says however successful she
and her gowns are she will only be out for
awe k this time. When she returns to
New Yortc she intends to get a new play
and new dresses. Her great desire is to
mafce a success in the East and then bring
a company to San Francisco.

BOURBONS FIGHT
WITH SPIRIT
The Junta Splits in Twain
and War Is in the
Air.
There Is a Hopeless Feud Be
tween the Kilkenny Cats of
Democracy.
RAINEY TO NAME SUPERVISORS
The Millionaire Candidate for Mayor
Cannot Clean the Augean
Stables.
The deadly feud existing between the
â warring factions of the Democratic Junta
was widened yesterday beyond all nope of
reconciliation, if, indeed, there was any
such hope before the hoodlum gathering
called Rainey's municipal convention dis
graced itself at Odd Fellows' Hall on Mon
day nicht.
There were mutterings and curses
among the disgruntled all day yester
The Augean Stable Appals the So-Called Democratic Hercules.
day. Men who went to the slaughter as
warriors in the lists against King Rainey
said they did not object to defeat in open,
honorable battle, but they protested
against the speed with which the machine
put through its slate. The many friends
of aued Peter McArdle, whose safety was
for a time in jeopardy, think there was no
excuse for the wanton insults that were
heaped upon bis head when ne attempted
to speak. Besides the catcalls and veils of
"Get onto yourself, old Whiskers." it :s
generally held that it was the basest of in
â ulte to gather the aged orator by the nape
of the neck and elsewhere and boost him
from the sta-e err; he had passed the first
mile r>ost of his peroration.
Just as Mr. McArdle had addressed an
apostrophe to liberty and entered upon an
appeal for purity he felt himself within
the clutch of tue bouncer. He made a
mute appeal to the mob and was hurled
back to bis seat. This insult his friends
resent. They say that it outdoes the wild
est orgies ever seen south of Market.
Besides the wide breach in the Junta, it
becomes daily more apparent that there is i
not a single point whereon the Junta and
the regular Buckley crowd can meet for a
moment. The gold element is now gener
ally understood as indorsing Pheian, and
it becomes more apparent every hour that
the friend 1 of Bryan and the silver ticket
will not be driven to stultify themselves
by supporting a man who believes, in his
heart, tnat the maÂ«ses of his Democratic
associates are anarchists, Populists and
enemies of the established order of things.
It is believed that Puelan's views on
tod are the same as those of ex-Mayor
I. B. Pond, and that the Junta's man for
the mayoralty wculd have gone to tne In- '
dianapolis Convention but for the fact j

that the tittle bee of ambition sung to him
the song tbat made nim long to be at the
head of the municipality.
But the dissension does not end here,
for there are local issues that promise to
cause much more confusion, bickering
anl bitterness.
There is not a more persevering friend
of the new charter in San Francisco than
the Junta's kid-glove candidate. On the
other han.i, Dimond is bitterly opposed to
the charter and stands ready to lead an
active fight against it. It is said that such
men as President Fletcher and oth-rs of
tne improvement clubs seriously object to
having the clubs indorse Phelan, who is
president of the associated clubs. They
say they are not organized^ for political
] urposes, and that they will under no cir
cumstances be put in the position of an
auxiliary campaign committee of Sam
Rainey's Junta. It is more than probable
that the row over the attempt to have
Pheian indorsed by the cluos will grow
much warmer, and that many of the mem
bers will fall in line and vote for Colonel
Charles L. Taylor.
Another element that greatly adds to
the Democratic confusion is the growing
strength of the Buckley crowd and t!>e
determined opposition of the Populists to
the gold ideas of Mr. Phelan. Many
Popocrats abolutely refuse to indorse or
appear to give countenance to a nan
whose views are in opposition to the
main sentiment of the campaign, as seen
from a Democratic viewpoint.
It was> quite plainiy decided yesterday
that Raiiiry will name his own Super
visors. This means that the young mil
lionaire's attempt to clean the Augean
stables of the Demncrp.cy will fail. In
consequence it is possible that still wider
confusion will re ult by the refusal of
Puelan to accept the Junta's nomination.
So altogether the Democoats are sorely
pressed and few know where they stand
and none bare hopes of victory.

Allied Democrats and Populists
Moat Under Difficulties.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 29.â A mass
meeting of the Allied Democrats, Popu
lists and Silver party was held to-night at
tbe Tabernacle. A hitch occurred over
the opening of the house, as the rent was
not paid in advance, but twenty-five silver
dollars were dug up and the hall was
opened. There was a moderate attend
ance and representatives of the three par
ties were on the platform.
Henry C. McPike ( Democrat") was elected
chairman, and the first speaker introduced
was Judge E. M. Gibson (Populist), who
made a long argument in favor of 16 to 11
Hon. M. r. Taylor of Colorado was the
next speaker. His remarks were confined
to the restriction of immigration and tbe
free coinage of silver and he paid a high
tribute to the ability of Senator Teller.
T. F. Garrity, a Democratic candidate f r
Superior Judge, also made a short speech.
Sliver Speakers.
A. C. Ellis of Salt Lake City and W. A.
Husby will address tbe silver meeting to
be held to-morrow night in Metropolitan

THE GUNS SNORTED.
Some "Wind ShotÂ»Â»Â» From the Dyna
mite Battery Fired for General
Mile*.
General Miles was at the dynamite bat
tery on the bluff above the fort yesterday
and some "wind shots" were fired for his
edification.
Tho test was one of the mechanisms of
the gum only, and no shell* were used,
but the force of the discharge was easily
seen by the way it cut the tops of the
young trees which are growing up in front
of the guns to "mask" the battery.
The sound of the discbarge could be
plainly heard for about a mile and a half,
but it is not a sound that "carries." It
seems more like a snort of displeasure,
greatly magnified and with a vicious snap
to it. It is very like the sound which
might issue frum an overworked exhaust
pipe, and it lias not even body enough to
echo from the hills across the 6trait. It
is at tne other end of the range, however,
that the dynamite gun does business, and
this feature was not shown to the general
yesterday. His attention might have been
drawn to some big boles in the bluffs
across the water made when the guns were
really loaded, however, as proof that they
can do more than give a non-committal
but impatient grunt when the button is
pressed.
City and County Hospital.
The out-clinic at the City and County Hos
pital for the treatment of poor patients has
been abolished by the Board of Health, and
Superintendent Stuhle calls the attention of
the indigent poor to that fact. This decision
was arrived at during a meeting of the board
on September 16 on a motion made by Dr H
H. Hart, which was carried unanimously 'ou
aad after to-morrow tho out-clinic will be
closed.
Broke HI a Right Leg.
William Jarman, a painter, living at 424
Page street, slipped from the curbstone at
Hayes and Octavia street* yesterday afternoon
and fell, breakine his right leg. He was taken
to the Receiving Hospital. Jarman has been
unfortunate, as only recently he fell and frac
tured his right kneecap.

PANDEMONIUM
AMONG POPULISTS
Ex - Boss Buckley's Fine
Hand Seen in Their
Nominations.
Leggett, Ferral, Dunne and
Burke Nominated for Su
perior Judges.
SUPERVISORS FOR FOUR WARDS
Riot Over Jndg! Hebbard's Candidacy.
More Nominations Will B:
Made To-Night.
Superior Judgesâ Robert Ferral, Frank
H. Dunne, Joseph Leggett and W. G.
Burke.
Supervisors â Twelfth Ward, Adolpb
Sutro; Eleventh Ward, D. B. T< dd; Tenth
Ward, William Fahey; Ninth Ward, Ter
ence O'Brien.
Cheers, shouts, stamping of feet, yells,
catcalls, hisses and howling. These are
the demonstrations that in large part sup
planted the regular programme of thÂ«
Populists in convention to make nomina
tions at Scottish Hall last night.
The body had hardly been called to or
der and the investigation committee re
ported favorably on the names of nominees
suggested at the previous session, with the
single exception of Judge Hebbard, when
a small riot was precipited by a favorable
ruling of tbe chair as regards the possibil
ity of Judge Hebbard as a nominee for
Superior Judge.
Preliminary to this ruling it was de
cided that four Superior Judges should be
voted for by each delegation, and that
after their names, when written on a
blackboard, should be placed a letter
showing if the candidates were also the
nominees of other parties. It was further
settled that any delegation casting more
votes than it was entitled to should be
debarred from voting any more for the
evening. This rule was afterward re
peatedly violated, but in each case the
delegation was permitted to correct its
vote.
The names of those voted on for Suoe
rior Judges were A. A. Sanderson (D.),
Frank H. Dunne (D.). Robert Ferral (D.),
H. W. Philbrook (I.), Joseph Leggett (D),
Rhodes Borden (D.), W. G. Burke (D.), F.
J. Murasky (D.). Borden was obliged
Will Vote for Bryan.
prior to the balloting to appear before the
investigation committee, whose questions
he answered properly.
Tingman asked for a ruling of the chair
on who should be considered nominees.
Day wait ruled that voting should be had
on candidates reported on by the investi
gation committee. This ruling would
have included Judge Hebbard.
Then came pandemonium. Gillespie
was on his feet in a trice, passionately ap
pealing from the chair's ruling.
"This is an attempt on the part of the
chairman to railroad a McKinley man and
a go.dbug through this convention," be
shouted in stentorian tones, "and it must
be defeated."
"Yes," yelled Cator, "it is a shame that
in the face of the resolution adopted by
this convention a McKinley gold bug
should be indorsed by this convention.
Every lawyer Knows that there i- par
tisanship on the bencu. No man who was
refused the nomination of his own party
should be considered by the Populist
party."
Dr. C. D. Cleveland also spoke to the
question, in emphatic tones supporting
Cator and Gillespie.
Attorney Ross of the Forty-fourth and
Hon. J. Taylor Rogers spoke in support of
tne chair, Rogers contending that tbe in
terpretation of parliamentary rules by
Hebbard's opponents was rendered in an
absurd manner.
Daywalt surrendered the chair to Ting
man, and spoke m behalf of his ruling in
a short but eloquent speech. He declared
that be wished to railroad no man through
the convention; he wished simply to see
tli at justice was done.
On bning put to a vote there was a divi
sion. John C. Gore called for a standing
vote, in order that the "traitors" should
be seen in all their conspicuousness.
Tingmun declared that there were no
traitors in the People's party. On a
Btanding vote the appeal of Giliespie was
sustained.
The name of James G. Britt was with
drawn from the candidacy lor Superior
Judge. The name of Frank Lawler was
substituted, but for some reason was not
voted on.
Charles Schaffer was suggested as a
nominee for Supervi or from the Sixth
Ward and Robert Munch as Surveyor.
The report of the committee un investi
gation statins that all suggestions of
names of nominees must be in by to-night
was read, and Stephen R. O'Keefe was
placed forward lor Police Judge. Ballot
ing for four Superior Judges was then
begnn.
Amid loud acclamation it was announced
that a total of 104 votes were cast, which
stood as lollows: A. A. Sanderson 29, F.
H. Dunne 79; H. W. Philbrook 28, Robert
Ferral 100. Joseph Leggett 95, W. G.
Burke 56, F. Mufasky 16, Rhodes Borden
17. Dunne, Leggett, Ferral and Burke,
receiving a majority over all, were de
clared the nominees of the People's party.
Balloting was then had for a Supervisor
from the Twelfth Ward. The name of T.
G. Parker, Mayor Sutro's only ODponÂ«nt,
was withdrawn by Attorney Haskell ac
cording to Parker's wish, and Sutro's
nomination was made unanimous for
Supervisor from the Twelfth Ward. Loud
cheering followed.
There were two candidates from the
Eleventh Wardâ J. A. Anthony (P.) and
D. D. Todd (D.). Todd received 66 votes
to Anthony's 35 and was declared the
nominee.
The vote for the candidates from the
Tenth Ward was: lor Charles Gildea (1).),
43; for William Fahey (D.), 48, and for Dr.
Rottanzi, 7. No one was declared the
nominee, as no candidate received a
majority over all. A reballot resulted in
Fahey receiving 57 and Gildea 40. Fahey
was declared the nominee.
In order to continue the balloting on
the Ninth Ward it was found necessary to
True, True; Every Word of It
True*
extend the time of adjournment from 11
to 11:30 o'clock. The ballot resulted in P.
D. Mullaney (D.) receiving 6 votes, Ter
ence O'Brien (D.) 71, H. B. Goeckin (D.)
7, John Baker (I.) 9 O'Brien was de
clared the nominee from the Ninth Ward.
A shrewd scheme was practiced in bring
ing: O'Brien's name forward as that of a
candidate of the Populist belief. Many
Populists left tbe hall still believing him
of their lollowing.
The casting of ballots was attended rith
great excitement, as many of the delegates
forgot to rise when their vote was an
nounced. Taken all in all, the consensus
of politicians is that Buckley was pretty
well represented on the ticket. Dunne is
said to be a Junta man.
Adjournment was taken till 7:30 o'clock
to-nighÂ», the convention to be hejd at the
People's Party tent.
ACCUSED SUPERVISORS,
Jury Impaneled by the Court
to Try the Solid
Seven.
Trial Did Not Proceed Yesterday
Owing to Illness of tbe Dis
trict Attorney.

cused by the late Grand Jury of miscon
duct in office in reducing the assessments
of the San Francisco Gaslk'bt Company
and Market-street Railway Company were
before Judge Seawell, Department
1, Superior Court, yesterday. They were

In the selection of the jury the defend
ants used nine peremptory challenges and
the people five. One juror was excused

biased or had close relations with the
Supervisors, the Civic Federation or the
corporations whose assessments were re
duced.
The accused Supervisors are: Joseph
King, Peter A. Scully, E. C. Hughes C.
E. Benjamin, A. W". Morgenstern, Chris

MOTHER-HEART
OF VOLUNTEERS
Mrs. Maud Ballington
Booth Speaks of Her
Children.
Impressive Inaugural Campaign
Service at Metropolitan
Temple.
THE RECORD OF SjX MONTHS.
Sketch of the Organ zation's Wonder
ful Progress in a Short Space
of T me.
"A Loving Greeting" â such was the
welcome, emblazoned in letters of azure
and gold, accorded by the Volunteers of
America u> their guests at iast night's in
augural campaign service in Metropolitan
Temple.
The troop 3 assembled at their head
quarters in the old Young Men's Christian
Association Building on Suiter street, and
marcned to the corner of Fifth and Jessie
streets, where a very creditable open-air
concert was given by the battalion brass
band. Meanwhile people were pouring
into the temple, the interior of which was
elaborately yet tastefully adorned with
hangings and flowers. Soon the building
was packed and when the exercises began
there was room for no more.
Major Blackhurst presided, and when
he led Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth to the
central seat on the platform there was a
burst of applause. Those oa the platform
knelt a moment in silent prayer, after
which the hymn '-Nearer, My God, to
Thee," was sung with a spirited chorus
after each stanza. The Rev. William
Rader, pastor of the Third Congregational
Church, then led in prayer.
Miss Montgomery gave a most artistic
and expressive rendering of "The Holy
City," beine accompanied on the piano
by Major Blackhurst, who proved himself
an able, sympathetic accompanist.
After a brief reading from the "Volun
teer Daybook." or manual of devotion,
and an oft-repeated chorus, Major Black
hurst deiivere.i a graceful audress of wel
come to Mrs. Ballington Booth, whom he
introduced as "the mother-heart of the
Volunteers."
The enthusiasm with which the little
lady was greeted was indescribable. Four
times did she attempt to speak, each time
being interrupted by bursts of cheering,
hats and handkerchiefs being waved amid
cries of "God bless Mrs. Booth," and huz
zas without number.
"I have come from my post in Sing
Sins," said Mrs. Booth, "and naturaLy
gravitated toward San Quentin. There I
found a glad welcome and I hope twenty
seven precious souls were saved.
"As yet the Volunteers of America are
a little weak band, only six months old.
We are not here to promise great things
nor to make ambitious schemes. The
Volunteers are animated by love of God,
love of country and love of the outcasts I
not by a spirit of controversy nor a wish!
10 tear open old sores. Ido not wish to I
attempt a justification of the course pur
sued by myself and my husband six !
months ago. That course was forced
upon us and resulted in the birth of
this movement â a movement brought
forth amid tears, prayers and heartrend
ing agony.
"We expected a longer, harder fight !
than we have had. The commander and
I, when the work of nine years was closed j
a ainst us, were minded to retire into
private life. Our hearts were crushed and
sorrowful. But friends besought us to set
them to work with us for God. Day after
day on our knees we sought for light and
guidance aud at last out of the primal
chaos came order. First we took a name.
England has its paid troops, Germany its
compulsory military servii c and France
its conscriptiqn, but this country in its !
days of darkest peril has ever relied upon !
its voliimetTÃ. The name soon became j
popular and is now our recognized title.
"Our aim has been misunderstood and !
misrepresented. We have been accused j
of neglecting the lower orders of society, '
of having no rescue homes, and of keep- '
ing away from the slums. As a fact, we j
wish and intend to go wherever Christ !
may wish us to carry his mes-age of hope '
to the boneless. This is our field. Let us !
grow a little â we are only six months old â i
and we will try to labor in it as best we !
BUT.
"We started with five officers in three j
rooms. We have now in New York head- j
quarters consisting of t ree floors, with a I
staff of forty-five officers. Our posts j
throughout the Union number 116, and
OUT officers upward of 300. We nave no
life vows. The commander and I never
took vows for life, as we came into the Sal
vation Army before the swearing-in service !
was instituÂ«ed.
"Our work is a National one, though we
shall gladly let any Volunteer leave our ;
ranks to work for Gel in foreign lands, |
and try to raise the money for nis fare."
Mrs. Ballington Booth then announced I
that she had a secret which she would re- I
veal this evening. She also gave a sKetch
of the order's secular branch, the "De
fenders' League," and invited new mem- â 
bers into its ranks. A band of winsome â 
lasses in cadet blue uniforms went through
thÂ« audience and soon recruited a score or
so of "defenders," each of whom pledged
$5 a year for the support of the cause.
The doxology was sung, and after a
brief prayer Mrs. Ballington Booth pro
nounced the benediction.
