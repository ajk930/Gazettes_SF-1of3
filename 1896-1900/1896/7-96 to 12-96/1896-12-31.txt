"OUR MACEO
STILL LIVES"
This the Joyful Cry of
Patriots Heard in
Cuba.
SAY TEE GENERAL WAS
ONLY WOUNDED.
Startling News Reaches Havana
From the Camps of the
Insurgents.
HIS FOLLOWERS HAD BELIEVED
HIM DEAD.
When Boms From the Battk-Field
the Chief Was Found to B;
Breathing
HAVANA, Cuba, via Key West, Dec.
30.â "Our Ma ceo still lives!" is the Cu
bans' joyful cry. The first rumors, ac
cepted with incredulity, are now gaining
ground. Information is coming into the
city daily giving precise details. It is said
, that when he fell from his horse his fol
lowers thought him dead, but found that
he was still living and spread the news
that he was dead in order to carry him to
a place of safety. Under a strong escort
. they carried him to the Siguaues Hos
pital where, under the skillful treatment
of doctors, the chief is now slowly recuper
ating. The acute period has now passed.
It seems that only one wound is danger
ous, that being in the stomach.
Zsrtucha's treachery is being confirmed
daily. It is said that Maceo's first words
when he was able to speak were to order
Zertucha's capture, but 1"> had already
fled to the Spanish lines. Zeitrcna wrotn
the paper found on Gomez's uo :y Gomez
. was killed by a bayonet thirst, and did
not stab himself as the Span:' <h say.
Guanabacao, situated o- ,<i other side
of the harbor, is terribly edited by the
Â° crimes that the notorious >ujor Fonde
o vilia is committins: daily. Fajnili.^ are
moving to Havana, being horror stricken.
The daily butcheries by Spaniards
are said to exceed thirty. It is hard
yto" obtain facts, as the people fear to
eak, but herewith is an incomplete list
and dates of those killed :
On the 23J, the same day he took com
; .aand, he ordered the brothers Ruiz killed;
on the 24th, one man named Sotolongo;
on the 25th, Nunez, and others on the 26th;
Morales, 80 years old, on the farm of
Norca, and seven more, besides Pastorisa,
well-known in Havana as a baseball
player.
It is said that during the last three
nights more were killed. All were taken
at night from their homes, bound and
brought to the outskirts of the city,
slashed with machetes and their bodies
left on the field. Their families were pro
hibited from burying them. No formal
trial was given â not even a semblance of
. one. All were killed at once on Fonde-
villa's orders. Some foreigners appealed
. to their consulates for protection.
The news, when received in Havana,
. created a j;reat impression among the Cv
â  bans. The Spaniards admit the facts and
. many of them strongly protest.
Private information received from Santa
Sp o iritus reports that Gonit-z with a large
fores, Quintin Banderas, commanding the
vanguard, is now in that section moving
west; also that another expedition was
landed in that province.
It is said that the Marquis Apezlegnia
sailed to-day for Spain commissioned by
Spanish merchants and planters to ask for
Weyler's recall. Weyler's unpopularity
amon? tbe Spaniards is increasing. Hos
tile sentiments are now openly expressed.
It is admitted that the campaign in Pinar
del Rio is a complete failure, and that the
marches through the province ere dimply
promenades along the base of the hills.
. They are furious when realizing that
25,000 men do not dare to attack the rebel
strongholds on the mountain summits.
â  It is paid that the rebels are quietly wait
ing to allow him to march unmolested.
â  He will faoon leave the province and de
clare the same pacified, when they will
swoop down from the hilis with fire and
sword and lay the whole country waste.
At the last moment news was received
of an engagement in Pinar del Rio.
Munoz, with 800 men, defeated Colonel
Segura, inflicting heavy Josses on the
Spaniards, thirty of whom are reported
killed and over 100 wounded.
â¢ During the fi.ht Charles Dougherty, an
'American citizen, was captured by the
Spanish troops and slaughtered. A cold
watch with his monogram was found on
his t>erson and is now in the possession of
â Segnra. None of the encounters in Pinar
del Rio are allowed to b2 printed and no
official reports are given. Weyler's scheme
is to declare th-s province pacified and that
the rebels have disbanded and offer no en
counter.

The Liberal Jjeadcr Says Europe Sym
pathize* With Spain.
MADRID, Siai.v, Dec. 30.â A report of
an interview with ex- Premier Sagasta,
the leader of tbe Spanish Liberals, is pub
lished in El Liberal, in which Senor
Bapasta is reported as saying that Europe
Is in sympathy with Spain in her main
tenance of Spanish sovereignty in Cuba,
vbut that Europe wishes to see the estab
* -shment of re.'orms in Cuba. Senor
Sagasta further expresses his belief that
Premier Canov:is only awaits a report
from General Weyler that the Pinar del
Bio and Havana provinces are cleared of
rebels when he will introduce reforms In
Cuba which will virtually be tantamount
:o autonomy. The ex-Premier further says
that Captain-General Weyler himself is.

the island, he being impotent to quell the
rebellion, and be believes that the in
surgents will reappear in the Pinar del
Rio province as soon as the Spanish
troops are withdrawn.
WAR MATERIAL, FOR CUBA.
The Dauntless and Commodore to Sail
With Heavy t'nrgoe*.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Dec. 30.â The
Collector of the Port to-day received in
structions to grant clearance papers to the
Dauntless, with a cargo of munitions of
war for Nuevitas, Cuba, and require the
master, owners and consignors to take the
oath required in sections 4197, 4193 and
4200, Revised Statutes. This oath is the
same required of masters of all vessels
with a j-eneral carpo bound to foreign
ports. The Collector was instructed to
notify the captain of the Boutwell, so that
he would not interfere w: h the vessel
other than to see that an arn.ed expedition
was not carried.
In consequence of this authority the
owners of both the Dauntless and
Commodore are preparing to send heavy
cargoes of arms and munitions of war to
Cuba. The clearance of the Dauntless
was authorized in thefollowine communi
cation from the Collector of the Port to
the owner:
Sir: Responding to yonr application of yes
ierday for clearance of the steamer Dauntless
I have to inform you that lam authorized by
the Honorable Secretary of the Treasury to
clear the steamer Dauntless in a strictly regu
lar way for the port of Nue vitas.
The Dauntless left Jacksonville Tues
day on a wrecking trip and has not yet
been heard from, but her owner expects
the vessel in port to-morrow. The Com
modore has been on the ways for some
time, but is now ready for sea
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec 30âUp to
the hour of closing the department no in
formation had been received by the Secre
tary of the Treasury respecting the action
of the Collector at Jacksonville upon his
telegram as to granting a clearance of the
Dauntless. A dispatch from Jacksonville,
however, stated that the tug was down
the coast somewhere, and no application
for clearance had been made by her
master.
This afternoon an application was re
ceived at the department for clearance for
the steamer Commodore with a cargo of
merchandise and munitions of war for
Cienfuegos, Cuba, and the Collector was
instructed to follow the same course re
garding that application as in the case of
the steamer Dauntless.

SATS MACHO IS IN HIDING.
Colonel Hfontrro's Widow Relieves That
the Cuban Chief Liven.
KEY W T EST, Fla., Dec 30.â Dolores
Montero, widow of Lino Montero, lieuten
ant-colonel in the insurgent army, arrived
in this city to-night, twenty-two days
from Jaruco. She reports that the insur
gents are numerous in the province of
Havana and are well supplied wiih arms
and ammunition, and the bujrle call of the
insurgents can be distinctly heard in
many of the cities.
She states' that before leaving Jaruco
Maceo had been wounded and it was re
ported that Dr. Zertucha shot him, the
ball entering the back of Maceo's neck and
coming out of the mouth. The chief was
carried off by his men and is now in
hiding, attended by four of the best physi
cians in tbe insurgent army.
She states that she knew of tbe murder
of Charles Govin, and that she was told
by her husband on the day following the
arrival of the Cowley expedition that
Govin was killed in a most shocking man
ner, having been literally hacked to pieces.
The lady has been taken in charge by the
Cuban relief committee.
Iwenty-two raciticos were killed on the
night of the 28th inst. in Guanabacoa.
INFITING MEDIATION.
J>Â« Lome Said to Have Made Overtures
to Secretary Oiney.
LONDON, Eno., Dec. 30.â The Chronicle
will publish a dispatch from Washington
s::yinj{ that Senor De Lome, the Spanish
Minister to the United States, has in
timated in an unofficial way to Secretary
of State Oiney that Spain wili accept the
mediation of the United States for the
settlement of the Cuban trouble after
Captain-General Weyler shall have cleared
the Province of Pinar del Rio of
rebels, when the Spanish Government
will be prepared to grant the Cubans vir
tually everything they demand except
complete autonomy and independence.
The dispatch says it is a matter of doubt
whether or not the Cuban leaders will be
willine to enter into negotiations with
Spain under these conditions, but if they
are willing General Fitzhugh Lee, the
Consul-General in Havana, will act as go
between.
BUINTER A URBAN FLAG.
Priest's Act Cause, a Clash , Between
Mexican* and Spaniards.
SAN i DIEGO, ;Cal , ; Dec. 30.â The en
mity between Mexican and Spaniards
because of the Cuban question, broke f out
in open warfare at Coatepec, State of
Vera Cruz. Southern papers tell of the
| intense feeling on both sides, as a result
of the desire of all Mexicans -; to see Cuba
free and their painstaking efforts to make
all Spanish residents acquainted with the
fact. "â  â â "'â ',' .. : *.- " ;.
At Coatepec the trouble arose over the
act of a parish priest in raising the flag of
Cuba Libre over his church. U'he good
man, inspired by the passionate Jove of
liberty that Mexicans are taught to believe
should be manifested, whatever the con
sequences, wade a flag with a single star,
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 31, 1896.
FEATURES OF THE CLOSING YEAR
in the Cuban colors, and when the news
came that the insurgents had won a sub
stantial victory over "Weylerelasasinato,"
the priest hurried to the church, unrolled
hie flag and flung it to the breeze.
In an hour or so the Spanish residents
of Coatepec numbering several hundred
gathered and began to threaten the priest.
The Spaniards held a meeting and drew
lots to see who should climb the steeple
and haul the flag down. The act was con
ceded to be a daring one, as the Mexicans
and Indians wouid doubtless kill the of
fender if he were captured.
Tbe natives learned of the meeting and
Its object, hastily armed themselves and
went to defend the priest and the Cuban
fl^g. The Indians for several miles around
armed themselves with machete 3, pistols,
kn.ves, clubs and brickbats and hurried
to the church. The Spaniards in smaller
numbers than the natives made a raid
and tried to force an entrance to the
church. A storm of missiles met them
and several broken heads resulted. One
Spaniard shot at the iini and was almost
killed by the clubs and sticks that struck
him.
After a half hour of clubbing and wary
plotting on both sides, the Spaniards de
cided to treat the matter with supreme
contempt and withdrew. The sturdy In
dians returned to their labor and the little
parish priest kept the flag of Cuba libre
flying all day.
GOVERNOR FRANKLIN SCO R ED.
Arizona People lieaent His Statement
QHftlaninff Iheir l.ounllft.
PHCENIX, Ariz., Dec. 30.â An immense
crevd gathered at the courthouse here to
night and were addressed by a number of
speakers, including Chief Justice Baker
and Mayor Monihon, in the interest of
Cuban recognition. The following resolu
tions weie passed unanimously, and hun
dreds signed the roll for their country's
service:
Whereas, The patriotism of the people of
Arizona and their loyalty has been put In
question by reason of a certain telegram sent
by Governor B. J. Franklin to the New Yoric
Journal stating that in case of war between
the United States and Spain on the Cuban
question Arizona would not furnish a volun
teer; and, whereas, the statement in said tele
gram does not reflect or voice the sentiment
of tbe people of Arizona in the promises;
now. therefore, be It
Jiesolvcd, That the statement of Governor B.
J. Franklin contained in his telegram to the
New York Journal, expressing his belief that
Arizona would not lurnish a volunteer In tin
defense of the Government in case of war with
Spain, be hereby repudiated and coiidemued,
as it does not express the Rentixnent and feel-
Ings of the people of Arizona in the matt/ â .
The people of Arizona, being; patriotic aad
loyal to the Government, would, in case of war
between the United States and Spain or any
other nation, Eland firmly by the Government
and furnish their proportion of able-bodied
men and means to sustain the Government to
the end; and be it further
Resolved. That we are in sympathy with the
people of Cub a, who are struggling for their
liberty, and are inlavor of the recognition by
the United States immediately of the inde

SAN PEDROITES
ARE SANGUINE
Fight for a Deep- Water
Harbor Ends at Los
Angeles.
Supporters of the Rival Sites
Await the Commission's
Decision.
The Opponents of a Southern Pacific
Monopoly Confi lent That They
Will Triumph.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 30.â The
karbor fight is ended so far as the general
public is concerned. After a day of re
capitulation and rebuttal Admiral Walker,
president of the board, asked this after
noon:
"G?ntlemen, are you all through?"
The response came from both sides and
in the same breath :
"Your Honor, we are."
"Then," said the admiral, "I declare
this hearing adjourned sine die."
The contest has been a memorable one
in very many particulars. The friends of
the free harbor are more than satisfied
with tbe showing they have made in favor
of the "only natural harbor both for refuge
and commerce on the coast of Los Angeles
County.' 1 That it far outranks Santa
Monica was proved by the testimony of
an imposing array of shipmasters of Jong
experience, as well as of pilot masters,
contractors for dredging and the under
officers. These people had no pecuniary
interest to subserve and were indifferent
as to the result of the investigation. On
the other hand the advocates ol the Hunt
ington scheme, with the single exception
of Captain Alexander of the steamer Santa
Rosa, had been especially employed, ac
cording to the statements of Huntington's
managers themselves, to conduct this
fight, and were or are employes of the
Southern Pacific and directly accountable
to Hood or Muir. who managed the fight
for Santa Monica. As to the result of the
inquiry San Pedro's friends are sanguine.
Engineer Corthell was the first witness
to-day in rebuttal in behalf of Santa Mon
ica. Referring to the requirements of a
commercial harbor, the speaker inquired
if they could not be found at Santa Monica
as well as at San Pedro. The estimates
made by Professor Benyard would suggest
that the cost of the necessaiy work at Ban
Jedro would far exceed the amount named
in the appropriation biil. Corthell gave
data as to the construction of modern har
bors and the deepening of channels.
Where these improvements were contem
plated, the channels were planned to be at
least thirty feet deep at low water. The Suez
canal had plenty of water at one time; but
a greater depth was now demanded. The
Nicaragua canal would carry at least thirty
feet of water. The modern style of deep
water ships called for that depth of chan
nel. It would be useless to build a harbor
on this coast at a less depth. The engi
neers for San Pedro, he declared, did not
contemplate such a depth of water.
Corthell, in again mentioning the im
aginary drifting sand, argued that a har
bor at San Pedro would greatly suffer by
reason of the sand and sediment that
would accumulate in that quarter. Re
ferring to the mouth of Wilmington Har
bor, he said the current formed a crooked
entrance. It constantly created a bar and
if a breakwater were built this bar would
simply be moved further out. Jour plans
had been offered by eminent engineers for
a harbor at San Pedro, indicating the
great natural difficulties that existed there
and must be overcome. But one plan nad
been offered for Santa Monica, as the con
ditions were simple, In mentioning de
tached breakwaters like the one at Santa
Monica Corthell again defended their
utility and usefulness in forming harbors
of refuge and commerce.
The question of swells was again taken
up. Corthell said he could noi be made
to believe tnat an oblique swell was less
dangerous to a breakwater than a normal
one.
Super ntendent J. A. Muir of the South
ern Pacific Railroad Company was intro
duced and offered a little evidence in re
buttal of what bad been said by certain
gentlemen who had appeared before the
board. He quoted from a letter written
by the master of an English vessel, who
had an experience in Santa Monica Bay.
He wrote that lie was well pleased with
the shipping facilities at that port and
considered it a safe place to take a ship to.
Mr. Muir referred to the statement made
by Pilot Weldt, as to the length of time
he (Weltit) bad been a pilot at San Pedro.
The records showed he had been commis
sioned as a pilot but about ten years, and
not fifteen, as Weldt had stated. Captain
Smith, in hi? testimony, had asserted that
he had commanded the ship Whitelaw.
Muir read a telegram from the owner of
the Whitelaw, which stated that he had
no recollection of Captain Smith ever hav
ing commanded the Whitelaw.
At a later stasre of the proceeaincs, Cap
tain Smith was permitted to make a per
sonal explanation. He said tiiat at one
time, while the captain of the Whitelaw
was ill, he had been placed in command.
Mr. Eyde, an employe of the Long
Wharf, was called to throw a little light
on the character of Captain Johnson, who
had been in command of the Enoch Talbot.
Johnson had testified that he was forced
on one occasion to stay in Santa Monica
Bar for the greater part of a month with a
load of lumber. The sea was so rough
that it was impossible to discharge the
i cargo. Hyde stated that the delay in un
; loading the Talbot was not due to an
| agry sea but to Captain Johnson, who
neglected his duty. He spent a great
deal of time on shore and Jelt the work of
unloading to others. Captain Dornfeld
also told of why Captain Johnson was de
layed at the wharf. He said the captain
die not attend to his business. Johnson
was absent a great deal of the time and
his statement that the sea was too rough
was absurd, said Dornftld.
Engineer Hood announced at this point
that he would like to mate a few remarks.
He sr.id it was unfortunate that the wit
nesses introduced at this hearing had not
been placed under oath. It might have
caused some of them to testify more
cautiously. In reference to the introduc
tion of petitions signed by business men
he said his side had not thought it neces
sary to make an effort in that direction.
He personally had great contempt for all
such petitions. He made reference to the
petition signed by business men and in
troduced by the friends of San Pedro and
said the list included the names of but
few importers; it was made up of all
classes of residents, regardless of their
interests as shippers. Hood scouted the
idea that the real business men were in
favor of San Pedro.
Engineer Moore offered rebuttal testi
mony i:i favor of San Pedro. No new facts
were developed, his remarks being more
in the nature of a review of some of his
previous remarks and the expressions used
by other witnesses. In referring to the
height of waves and the statement that
they were higher at San Pedro than at
Santa Monica, Moore insisted such an as
sertion did not conform ti the facts. In
conclusion, he said he believed his side
had supplied sufficient evidence to con
vince any one that Santa Monica Bay was
not a good place at which to construct a
deep-water harbor; that the facilities of
fered at that point would permit of but
one company operating there. On the
other hand, San Pedro was a site where
a harbor of refuge might be constructed,
as welt as a great harbor of commerce.
In reply to a question by Morgan Moore
reiierated a statement previously made by
him, that Point Dame would be a better
site for a harbor of refuge than the point
where the Southern Pacific's long wharf
was located.
He referred to theflimited space ships
would have in making port at Port Los An
geles in case of a storm. If they failed to
get behind the breakwater they wou'.d be in
great danger of running into the wharf
or onto the shore. Seeking refuge in time
of danger in such a harbor would be
very hazardous. Such difticulues would
not be encountered at San Pedro.
Mr. Gibbon of the Terminal Railway
made a brief reference to what Hood said
in regard to petitions. He said the gen
tle man and his associates at onetime did
not entertain so contemptuous an opinion
of the views of business men.
This virtually closed the proceedings,
and Admiral Walker so announced. The
board will continue its work, and will
probably remain in this section for some
time.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
SUGAR PRODUCERS
SEEK PROTECTION
A Day Before the Ways
and Means Com
mittee.
Every Branch of the Industry
Arrayed Against Foreign
Competition.
Senator Perkins Submits a Written
Argument Containing Facts of
Vital Interest.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 30.â The
session of the Committee on Ways and
Means to-day was given to the question of
sugar duties. The opening was devoted
to the sugar importers, whose views were
voiced by John Farr of New York, who
said that at a recent meeting of the
sugar importers of that city it was
unanimously decided that an ad valorem
rate of duty was unfair, unequitable and
exceedingly difficult in practice; that 1
cpnt a pound should be imposed on all
suear below 75 degrees polariscope, and
that additional discriminating duties
should be levied on all sugars coming
from bounty- paying countries.
The beet sugar interest was represented
by Henry A. Oxnaid of Grand Island,
Nebr. ; Herbert Myrich of Chicago, editor
of the American Agricultuie, and R. M.
Allen of Ames, Nebr., president of the
Beet Sugar Association.
The cane sugar interest of Louisiana
was represented by J. D. Hill of New
Orleans.
No representative of the sugar-refining
industry had applied for a hearing, and
there was a conspicuous absence of the
members of the sugar trust.
In the course of his statement Mr. Farr
gave the following figures as being the
nearest to an advance from Jhe present
basis as representing fairly all interests:
On all sugars tested by the polariscope,
when landed, 75 degrees and under, 1 cent
per pound on net landed weightâ adding
.03 per cent for each degree up to ICO de
gree, a fraction of a degree to be assessed
in proportion.
"I think," said Mr. Farr, "that one
fourth of a pound differential duty, in
stead of one-tenth of a cent, would ap
proximate wtiat is right."
W. J. McGahan, president of the McGa
ban Sugar Refining Company of Philadel
phia, said that we bad bad now two years
and four months of the present tariff, with
a protection of one-eighth of a cent per
pound, or about 4 per cent, while beet
growing countries pay a bounty of about
three-eighths of a cent, giving foreign re
finers of bounty-paying countries about a
quarter of a cent advantage in our mar
ket. This had resulted in 1896 in an in
crease of about 110 per cent in imports of
refined against 10 per cent increased im
portations of raw, while our refineries
have been running less than GO per cent of
their capacity. He favored a.i ad valorem
duty on sugar, and advocated placing mo
lasses on the free list, it being a by-product
of sugar.
Mr. Myrick of New York next addressed
the committee. He said it required every
pound of wheat and flour exported by the
United Slates during the past fiscal year
to pay for the sugar imported. The total
value of all live and dressed beef, beef
products and lard exported during the
past year barely equaled the amount paid
foj imported sugar. Our immense export
trade in cotton represents in value only
twice as much as our imports of sugar.
Our vast export of tobacco must be mag
nified thrice to counterbalance sugar im
ports. The barley, oats and rye, fruits,
nuts, hops, vegetable oils, oleomargarine,
butter and cheese, pork and hams thai
were exported last year, all put together,
represent in value only two-thirds of the
sugar imported. It is an economic crime
to compel American farmers to raise sta
ples in competition with the cheap land
and labor countries with which to pay for
imported sugar, besides standing the
freight and commission both ways.
"The American farmers," Mr. /kfyrick
continued, "demand a fair chance to pro
duce everything our people consume that
can be grown in the United States. They
want to begin with sugar. They have
found by practical experience and scien
tific tests that from the Hudson River to
the Pacific and from the Caroliuas to the
lakes they can grow sugar-beets as rich or
richer in saccharine contents than those
of Europe. They want factories to afford
a market for these sugar-beets, which they
are willing to furnish at from fi to $o per
ton.
"At these prices the crop is both a new
and profitable one. Every acre devoted
will by so much reduce the competition in
other branches of farming. What stands
in the way of the American beet-sugar in
dustry is mainly European competition.
Europe is now sending us nearly one hun
dred times as much beet svgaÂ»" as she did
fifteen or seventeen years ago. She has
developed her beet-sugar industry by a
liberal system of direct subsidies, hitjh
protection and export bounties until the
European beet-sugar industry has prac
tically ruined the cane-sugar industry of
the tropics and monopolized the sugar
marsets of the world. To complete the
destruction of the American sugar in
dustry, or at least to prevent the further
development of the beet-sugar business in
this country, Germany has rec> ntly in
creased its export bounty and France is
about to follow suit, thus enabling their
sugar to be sold in the United States be
low the cost of production in this country.
"What is needed is a reasonable specific
duty on all imported sugar and an addi
tional discrimination duty from countries
paying an export bounty eaual to th;it
bounty. Then with such aid as the various
States and localities interested mny offer,
to secure sugar factories, the beet-sugar
industry could be put on its feet in this
country within a very few years. It would
afford farmers the new and rentable crou
they must have. If by 1910 the domestic
industry supplies the home martet, as it
should, it will be putting into tue pocket)
of our people $200,000,000 a year that other
wise would be sent out of the country.
The committee here took a recess. On2
reassembling Henry T. Oxnard of Grand
Island, Nebr., president of the Beet-sugar
Association of the United States, spoke in
behalf of that industry. He favored an
additional dt>ty on sugars above No. 16
duties standard in color, to prevent the
foreign refiners from entering their soft,
refined sugars here at the same rate of
duty as raw sugars of the same test.
It was also recommended that an addi
tional discriminating duty be placed on
all sugars coming from bounty-paying
countries, with authority to the executive
to reduce or increase this additional duty
in such proportion as the bounty-paying
countries may from time to time raise or
lower their bounties.
It was estimated that the average polari
zation of raw sugars imported into this
country is about 92 degrees. Such sugars
would pay 1.51 cents per pound, which
would produce an annual revenue on this
article of about $50,000,000, calculating
upon importations of about 1,500,000 tons
of dutiable sugars, which had been the
average the past few years.
The next speakeis were Solon
Humphreys and J. Smith of Kew York.
James D. Hiil of New Orleans made an
argument in behalf of a committee of the
American Cane-growing Association. He
asked thai the rate pf duty on sugar
under the act of 1833 be reimposed.
Nothing less than that, he said, would be
batisfactory.
J. Hale Sypher, formerly of Louisiana,
presented some additional facts in regard
to the cane-sug->r industry of Louisiana,
and gave it as the result of his experience
and inquiries that the cost to the sugar
trust of 1 dining sugar did not exceed one
quarter of a cent a pound, while in Louisi
ana the cost was about three-eighths of a
cent. This, he added, did hot include
waste.
Solon Humphreys of New York made
some additional remarks and inquired as
to the cost of refining sugar.
Mr. McMillin asked whether refining
in this country was not in the hands of the
sugar trust.
Mr. Humphreys showed a manifestjdisin
clination to go into the matter, saying
that members of the committee knew as
much about it as he did.
F. B. Thurber of New York, president
of the American Grocer Publishing Com
pany, spoke in behalf of the consumers,
distributors and refineries of sugar in the
United States. He said the consumers of
France and Germany â the largest pro
ducers of sugar in the worldâ pay about
50 per cent more than those of the United
States; but those countries protect their
sugar industries with a bounty, which
enables them to dump their surplus on
foreign markets at abnormally low prices,
which have broken down the refining in
dustry in England, and but for our bar
rier of protective duties they would do the
same lor both our producing and refining
industries. One feature, he said, should
not be lost sight of : Any differential im
posed on the product of any country
granting a bounty should only apoly to
the refined product, and not the raw ma
terial required by our refineries.
Mr. Tburber said that the distribution
ol sugar by wholesale is now practically
on the commission basis. The sugars are
sold with the understanding that a cer
tain commissionâ about 3-16 of 1 per
centâ is paid to the wholesaler as his
profit; and while the Ameriian Refining
Company will sell sugar to any one at its
li<.t price he cannot get the benefit of that
three-sixieenths commission unless he is
bound by that agreement, the sugar-re
fining company requiring that tht sugar
shall not be sold at less than the manu
facturers' first price.
The payment of this commission is
made in the form of a rebate when the sale
is made, and those who deal in those
goods have to make a statement before
tuey can get this rebate that they have
not violated their undertaking not to sell
below the list price. Without this cer
tificate they do not get paid for handling
the goods.
He said, in answer to another question,
that the present duty was not sufficient to
protect the industry and to encourage the
investment of additional capital. Years
ago it was admitted that this country
could not produce the sugar consumed
here. Conditions, however, have changed. '
The Deet sugar industry could be developed
in twenty States, and if the McKinley law
had lasted for fifteen years, factories would
have been started in all these States, and
the United States would produce all the
sugar needed for home consumption.
The question was asked if we could do
this. He contended that we could. We
have the climate and soil necessary and
seven factories now running are producing
75,000,000 pounds of sugar annually. We
were about the only civilized country not
producing its own sugar. In cane and
beet sugar we are now producing about
one-seventh of the amount consumed at
home. In this connection he quoted from
consular reports to show what we were
paying abroad for sugar, and that we had
sufficient territory to produce our own
sugar if the industry was sufficiently pro
tected. The sugar-producers of the United
States only needed fair protection to en
courage them to meet these conditions
abroadâ cheap labor and raw materials,
bounties, e'c. Germany was simply forc
ing the United States to defend a home
industry, and within the last six months
had sent a representative to every beet-
BUiiar factory in this country.
He referred to the Hawaiian treaty as a
failure and a one-sided agreement which
deprived us of much revenue. It was a
fraud upon its face and present conditions
demanded its cancellation. It involved
sugar, rice and other American products
which were struggling for existence.
The prouueers were not here to make ot
suggest a schedule for the American Re
fining Company, nor were they here to
antagonize it. The company did not em
ploy an army of laboiers, and trie protec
tion which would satisfy it would not be
requisite for our producers. The produc
ers required a duty high enough to place
them on a plane with foreign competition.
Owing to the financial condition It might
not be wise to renew the law of 1890, but
tile suggestion of 1883 seemed feasible.
He favored a duty and a bounty on
sugar. Such a schedule properly adjusted
could be made as nearly fair to all inter
ests as possible, jeopardizing none. It
could be made to yield more revenue, out
of which the bo..nty could be paid, while
it would offer sufficient protection and
adequate encouragement to develop the
domestic industry. He would give all
sugars of 75 test and under 1 cent per
pound, witti 3-100 cents additional for
each degiep or fraction thereof above 75
and belov 96 test by polariscope, and 4-100
cents for each degree and fraction, thereof
above 96 tesr.
The McKinley bill rate on molasses
should prevail. On all sugars above 16,
Dutch standard in color and testing over
96, make a differential rate of }4 of a cent
Instead of y s of a cent per pound, with a
countervailing duty 10 meet any foreign
import bounty, the Fame to be tentative
and to go off when.and U expert bounties
are repealed. Tben to farther protect,
and especially to encourage the protec
tion of domestic sugar, to attract to that
industry additional capital, he would
from the duty on sugar pay our dome&tic
producers % of a cent per pound on all
sugars testing not less than 90 degrees
produced from beets, cane or sorghum
grown in the United States. If thought
desirable % cent of the bounty could go
off at the expiration of every four years,
making it % cent after four years, the en
tire bounty to cease in twelve years,
which he claimed was the unexpired bal
ance of the obligation incurred by the
Government toward her home-sugar pro
ducers in the McKinley tariff of 1890.
To this schedule ne would add a pro
vision with regard to sugars from nations
imposing unreasonable re*triptions or ex
actions and refusing to enter into recipro
cal agreement for a free and fair exchange
of products, for duties of from 30 to 50
per cent above the standard specifics; or,
instead of that, apply to such nations the
previsions of the so-called Kerr bill,
minus th 9 tea and coffee clause, or the
Hopkins bill. Such a schedule would re
turn on the basis of our imports of duti
able sugars under 16 Dutch standard
for the year 1896 about $69,000,000. This
schedule would give only fair protection
and sufficient encouragement for an in
crease of domestic sugar. It would not
materially increase the price of sugar and
it would allow it to play its part in the
policy of reciprocity. We would get at
least $15,000,000 more of revenue from
sugars and would be aiding the domestic
product at a critical time.
Thomas K. Cutter of Utah spoke of the
detrimental effects of the Hawaiian
treaty, resulting, he said, in this country
paying rebates to the contract labor of
that country. If we made our own sugar
we would give employment to some
250.000 men annually and retain here
about $123,000,000 per annum. Utah, he
said, felt to a certain extent the hand of
the sugar trust. As soon as the Utan
producers went into their own market the
San Francisco sugar trust reduced prices.
In this matter the home producers had to
contend with the free Hawaiian product.
R. M. Allen of Nebraska asked for a
schedule which would encourage our
farmers and not give foreigners a mon
opoly of our marset. The farmers of Ne
braska would be materially assisted if
beet-growing could be made profitable and
they were ready and anxious to enter into
this industry.
Among the written arguments presented
to the Committee on Ways and Means to
day was one by Senator George C. Perkins
of California in favor of the imposition of
a specific tax of IVÂ£ cents per pound on
imported raw sugars. He showed that
the consumption of imported sugar by the
United States is about 1,700,000 tons a
year, all of which can, if the sugar interest
is protected, be produced in a few years
within our borders. He showed that the
area capable of producing beet sugar was
sufficient to more than supply the demand
of the United States, and that snpar beets
can be raised on soil ranging in character
from the alkali plains of the Pecos River
in Utah to the rich soil of California. He
pointed out the fact that France alone
produced sugar beets enough to manu
facture all the sugar that we import and
tnat Germany is a still greater producer
of sugar of this character.
Austria is a large producer. But these
countries have protected this interest so
that it has been enabled to increase to its
present vast dimensions, and now these
same countries are increasing the bounties
and duties in order to protect their re
spective producers against thecomoetition
of other European beet-sugar countries.
The sugar producers of the United States
are tlius forced into competition with the
protected suÂ»rar of Europe and for this
protected sugar are paying out nearly
$100,000,000 per year. This sum, he argued,
should be retained in the United States
and paid oat to our own laborers, farmers
and mechanics.
Adjourned until fo-morrow.
CONTRARY TO THE STATUTE.
Peculiar Case From Montana Promptly
Dismissed by the United States
Supreme Court.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 30.â A case
was docketed in the Supreme Court of the
United States yesterday the record of
which disclosed an entirely new ground of
offense in the State of Montana, and
which, if it had been held to be a crime,
would have resulted in the speedy de
population of that flourishing common
wealth.
On the 27th of April last T. A. St?ele, a
peace officer in Lewis and Clark County,
appeared before C. F. Ga.?e, a Justice of
the Peace in Helena Township, and made
complaint against one Yot Sang, that "on
or about the 24th 01 April, 1896, he did
with force and arms, carry on a business,
tor the carrying on of which a license is
required by law of this State, to wit: the
laundry business, other than a steam
laundry, said Yot Sang being a male per
son, allot which is contrary to the form of
the statute in such cases made and pro
vided, and against the peace and dignity
of the State of Montana."
When the Judges realized the possibili
ties of the situation as defined in that
complaint, that "being a male person"
was "contrary to the statute in such case
made and provided, and against the peace
and dignity of the State of Montana,"
they promptly dismissed Yot Sang, and
now J. H. J urgent. Sheriff of the county,
from whose custody he was released on a
writ of habeas corpus, wants the Superior
Court of the United States to review the
judgment of the District Court for that
State and to pass upon the constitution
ality and validity of the statute pleaded,
which requires a license for operating a
liana laundry, but does not require one for
a steam laundry.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1896.
WEDS ILLINOIS'
GOVERNOR-ELECT
Miss Cora English Becomes
the Wife of John R.
Tanner.
Every County in the State Has
a Representative at the
Ceremony.
She It Was Who Prompted Him to
Hake the Race for the Ex
ecutive Chair.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Dec. 30.â St.
Paul's Episcopal Cathedral was crowded
with society and political folk at high
noon to-day, when Governor-elect John R.
Tanner and Miss Cora English stood be
fore the altar and plighted their troth.
The marriage took place after the ritual
of the Episcopal church, Rev. Dr. Freder
ick W. Taylor officiating and Bishop
George F. Seymour pronouncing the bless
ing and benediction.
Twelve hundred invitations had been is
sued, and the congregation or audience
represented every county in the State and
many outside commonwealths. The
bride's toilet wa3 of pure white mir
rored velour, with short pointed bodice
edged with embroidered mull, frills of
the same material edging the high, close
collar.
About the shoulders and at the throat
the bodice was sprayed witn lilies of the
valley. The sleeves, which came down to
the knuckles, were close fitting to the
shoulder, while the skirt was perfectly
plain and with a train three yards in
length. Miss Mollie Katherine Stuve was
maid of honor and Miss Edith English
Buck served as flower girl. The ushers
were Messrs. English and Willouplibv
Walling, Henry Walker, George Pastield,
Harry Dorwin and Louis Miner.
After the church ceremony there was a
small wedding breakfast at the residence
of the bride's father, and the Governor
elect and his bride then left for a short
Southern wedding trip. They will return
a few days prior to the inauguration.
Governor-elect Tanner's marriage to-day
is his second venture on the sea of matri
mony, his first wife, by whom he has chil
dren now married, having died several
years ago. The bride of to-day is the
daughter of Turney English of this city,
and has been one of the queens of belle
dom. She belongs to one of the oldest
families in lhe United States, which traces
its ancestry by noted men and women
back through Virginia and Maryland his
tory to old England.
With American history the family has
been identified since 1600. Among her
near relatives are Governor Peter Turney
of Tenness-ee. Judee Hoke of Louisville
and General Daniel McClure, formerly as
sistant postmaster-general of the army.
She was closely related to the late W. H.
English of Indiana, nominee for Vice-
President on the ticket headed by General
Hancock; the late Dr. Norvin Green, pres
ident of tiie Western Union Telegraph
Company, and the late General J. B.
Frye, United States army, whose death
occurred recently.
A spice of romance attaches to the wed
ding from the fact that it was the bride
who first prom pte 1 in him the ambition
which led to his becoming a candidate for
Governor.
NO PLACE FOR ARMENIANS.
lhe Canadian Government JUscourage*
a Colonization Scheme.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 30.â A Sun
special from Ottawa says: A proposal
was recently submitted to the Dominion
Government to bring out Armenians to
settle on land in the Canadian Northwest.
The British Government last week cabled
the Governor-General nere to icnow what
the Canadian Government had decided to
do in the matter, and a meeting of the
Cabinet was held to deal with-it.
Yesterday a dispatch was sent to Joseph
Chamberlain that the scheme could not be
entertained, as the Canadian Government
had no funds from which the Armenians
might be assisted, and that it was consid
ered impossible to grant lands in a block
for settlement. It wÂ«s also held that in
view of the climatic differences, it would
not be in the interests of the Armenians
to bring them to the Canadian Northwest.

lowa Silverites Hold a Conference.
DES MOINES, lowa, Dec. 30.âRepre
sentatives of the Democratic free-silver
forces of all the counties in the State
rounded up at the Hotel Savoy yesterday
morning for a general conference concern
ing the condition of the part}' and to dis
cuss plans for maintaining and solidify
ing it during the next four years. Talks
with the delegates indicate that so far
from the result of the election having
thrown a wet blanket on the free-s;lver
movement in lowa, they are determined
to maintain the organization and to force
the issue in every Congressional and other
election to take place during the ensuing
three years. Plans will also be discussed
for reconciling the two factions 01 the
Democrats and for a fusion between the
Populists and the Silver Democrats. The
Populists, however, have given it out flat
footed that they are not prepared to give
up their distinct organization.

ARCHBISHOP FABRE DEAD.
The Eminent Prelate Succumbs to Cancer
of the Liver â A Long Life in the
Ministry.
MONTREAL, Quebec, Dec. 30.âArch
bishop Fabre, the head of the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal, died
shortly after 11 o'clock to-day from cancer
of the liver. He was 69 years old.
Charles Edward Fabre, Canadian
Roman Catholic Bishop, was born in
Montreal on February 28, 1827. At the
age of 9 he was sent to the College of St.
Hyacinthe, where he remained until 1843.
After spending two years in Paris he en
tered the ecclesiasticaJ seminary of Issy.
In 1846 he visited Italy, obtained an audi

ada. He was ordained priest February
23, 1850, nnd stationed as curate in Souel.
On October 30, 1852, he was appointed
pastorof Pointe-Claire, where he exercised
his ministry for two years.
He wa3 then summoned to Montreal
and became distinguished as a pulpit ora
tor, also ior his influence among the stu
dents of the city, his lectures and retreats
having wrought a marked change among
the medical students.
He iiade a second visit to Rome in 1b69,
at the time of the Vatican council, and
theuce went to Belgium to study the
inuthod of articulation in use in the deaf
and dumb asylums. He afterward turned
his experience to account in the institu
tion that he founded in Montreal. On
April 1, 1873, he was consecrated Bishop
of Gratianopolis and coadjutor of Mon
treal. . He was appointed Bishop of Mon
treal May 11, 1876, and in 1886, the diocese

first Archbishop on Jane 8.
JAMAICA FRUIT IN LONDON.
An Experimental Sale the Result of
Which May in Time Affect California
Shippers.
LONDON, Esq., Dec. 30.â Garcia, Jacobs
& Co. conducted the sale at the Covent
Garden market to-day of an experimental
cargo of Jamaica fruit, which arrived by
the steamer Port Victor. The sale at
tracted crowds of buyers both of London
and from the country. The offerings in
cluded 2000 boxes of oranges, of which
one- third was unsuitable, but the remain
der was of excellent quality and averaged
from 6s to 10s per hundred. About half of
the bananas were in bad condition, bring
ing only from 5s to 83 a bunch, whereas
they ought to have fetched from 10s to 20s
per bunch had they been in good oreer.
The steamer Eiderslie also brought a
cargo from Jamaica, but the fruit was con
demned as being unfit for use through de
fective cooling on board the ship. The
general opinion as to the result of the sale
13 that there is no doubt as to the success
of the venture of bringing Jamaica fruit
for sale in the London market when it
arrives in sound condition.
About 300 boxes of the Eiderslie' s
oranges were found to be in sound condi
tion and were sold at from 9s 6J to 17s 6d
per box. Riverside oranges sold at from
15s to 223 per box and were adjudged as
excellent in condition and quality.
DEADLY PLAGUE IN I NDI A.
Its Frightful Ravages Cause a Panic
Among the People.
LONDON, Eng. Dec. 30.â Bombay
correspondent of the Daily Mail reports
that the bubonic plague is spreading rap
idly and : is exactjkg fear. ' t The offi
cial ; figures sho^^Waf^here were 177 new
case? and 130 deaths from the disease dur
ing '" the ' past ~" two days. These figures,
however, are â¢ misleading, owing to the in
accuracy of the' native doctors, and the
number or new cases was probably con
siderably in excess of the official returns.
The death rate is stated to be extremely
hi h.: .
Two hundred thousand natives have fled
from the city and the panic is spreading.
Special trains have been put on the rail
ways for the use of refugees, and these are
crammed with ; people] seeking ? to \ escape
attack by the disease. The European resi
dents have so far remained in the city, but
they are getting anxious. It is doubtful
whether any Europeans have â  fallen vic
tims to the plague. The commercial in
terests combine to stifle^ the facts regard
ing the ravages of the disease.
THOUSANDS SWANDLED.
Two American Sharpers Wanted by the
Mexican Authorities.
CITY OF MEXICO, Mex., Dec. 30.â A
sensation has been caused here by reports
in the newspapers that two Americans,
named Hurley and Kastle, who had estab
lishea hundreds of watch clubs through
out the republic, have defrauded 7000 sub
scribers to the extent of $300,000, and that
application for the extradition of both
men, who are now believed to be in the
United States, would be made.
Hurley once lived in Austin, Tex., but it
is believed that he traded under his wife's
name. She, while here, held a high social
position. Kastle lived in various places
in the United States, and was once ticket
agent in this city of the Mexican Central
Railway.
THE PHILIPPINE REVOLT.
Execution of a leaderâ Reports of an
MANILA, Dec. 30.â Dr. Missal, who is
asserted to have been the promoter of the
revolt against Spanish authority in the
Philippine Islands, and who was some
time 3ince returned from Manila from
Barcelona at the request of the military
Judge, was shot on the 28th inst.
An engagement between the Spanish
forces and rebels in the vicinity of Puinac
resulted in the defeat of the insurgents,
who, it is said, lost 360 men killed. The
date of the engagement is not given.
PROBATE LETTER ISSUED.
Estate of the Late Archbinhop of Canter^
bury Valued at $250,000J
LONDON, Esq., Dec. 30.â Letters of pro
bate have been issued on the estate of tne
late Elward White Benson, the ninety
third Archbishop of Canterbury, who
dropped dead in the parish church of
Hawarden on October !1 last. Th- value
of the estate is sworn at nearly $250,000.
Dr. Benson was comparatively poor
when he was appointed Prima'e of all
England, and the estate that he leaves
represents his savings out of a total in
come from salaries and fees aggregating
$75,000 per year. The only heirs are Mrs.
Mary Benson, the widow, and his pon,
Arthur C. Benson of Eton College. The
estate is left to these intact, there being
no public or private bequests.
Of Great International Interest.
BERN*], Switzerland, Dae. 30.â The
Swiss Federal Council to-day rendered a
decision in the matter of the arbitration
claims of the French merchant and ship
owner, M. Fabiani, against Venezuela.
Fabiani asserted that President Blanco
ruined him, and his claims for indemnity
were submitted to tne Swiss confedera
tion in 1891. The award promulgated by
the Federal Council ro-day says that
Venezuela must pay Fabiani 4,346,656
francs. The decision solves a great many
points affecting the rights of nations, and
the document is expected to be of the
highest order of international value.
SHOOTS HIS WIFE
IN A COURTROOM
Sensational Incident in a
St. Lonis Divorce
Suit.
The Frenzied Husband Causes a
Panic Before He Is Dis
armed.
Turns the Weapon Upon an Uncle of
the Wcman and Tries to Kill
Himself.
BT. LOUIS, 111., Dec. 30.â One of the
most sensational scenes ever enacted in a
courtroom here took place to-day. Jacob
Fischel shot his wife in the c< urtroom
and tben attempted to kill her uncle as
well as shoot himself. The room was
crowded at the time, and the scattering of
spectators was very active for about five
minutes.
The trouble between Fischel and his
wife has been of long standing. He
was jealous of her, and when divorce pro
ceedings were brought, he not only
threatened her life, but said that he would
kill himself before she got a cent out of
him. No attention was paid to him, and
it was believed that he would not execute
his threats.
To-day when the matter came up in
court the first thing the Judge did was to
make an order that Fischel pay his wife
alimony. Fischel first turned red and
then white. With a quick movement to
bis hip pocket he faced the Judge and his
wife. In an instant a pistol was gleaming
in his hand and pointed directly at his
wife.
"Look out! He is going to shoot!"
cried a bystander.
The courtroom bailiff rushed toward
Fischel. He was too late, however, for
Fischel fired, and in the blinding flash
which followed Mrs. Fischel was seen
to stagger and then fall to the floor.
Fischel rushed over to her and shot her
again.
His wife's uncle then claimed his at
tention and with an oath he shot in his
direction.
By this time every one was climbing
over benches and trying to get out of
range. Judee Wood left his seat and got
behind a cabinet. When the uncle bad
escaped Fischel turned the pistol on
himself. He was finally overpowered and
the weapon taken away from him.
The wife's wounds are serious and it is
believed that she will not survite.
EXPELLED FOR FRAUD.
A Bucket-Shop Broker Thrown Out of
the New York Stock Ex
change.
NEW YORK, N. V., Dec. 30.â William
Euclid Youne was expelled from the New
Yorkiptock Exchange by fprmal vote of
the g^overning committee at the conclu
sion of a session which lasted from 3:30
until 7:30 o'cloctc to-night. Forty out ol
forty-two of the members of the commit
tee were present and the vote was said to
have been unanimous. The charge was
fraud.
The charge was in reality against the
firm of E. B. Cuthbert & Co., stockbrokers
at 30 Broad street. The Stock Exchange
authorities dealt with the member of the
firm who was a member of the exchange.
Mr. Young was the partner in the firm
who belonged to the exchange. He with
drew from the firm on December 22, but
that did not relieve him from the charge.
The original complaint against Cuth
bert & Co. was three months ago. A spe
cial committee from the governing com
mittee was appointed to investigate the
business methods of the firm. The com
mittee suspected Cuthbert & Co. of em
ploying bucket-shop methods, or, in other
words, of reporting to customers that
they bad purchased and sold stocks ac
cording to orders, when in fact they had
mada no transactions whatever. The
committee discovered evidence that an ar
rangement had been made with Jacob
Kirkner, a broker of 24 New street.

SAN DIEGO FAILS TO SCOBE.
Berkeley's Football Team Easily De-
feats the Southerners.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 30.â Berkeley
defeated San Diego at football this after
noon by a score of 48 to 0. Tne university
boys were in fine condition and handled
the San Diegos with ease, preventing
them from approaching the goal or even
securing a temporary advantage. Ran
some (fullback) and Hall (quarter) did
brilliant work for the visitors running
around ends.
Ransome did not equal Schulenburg of
San Diego in his goal-kicking. Schulen
burg rather excelled Ransome in putting
also.
The catching by the university boys was
very good, but tueir best work was in in
terference. This they had down to such
a fine point that tney carried the pigskin
into toe enemy's ground almost as they
liked, though occasionally meeting strong
opposition. The Berkeleys formed a line,
composed of their best men, and this line
marched straight through the enemy's
line, guarding the man with the ball.
San Diego did several clever plays that
won approbation from tne talented young
men of the university. Both side 3 played
clean football and the bisr crowd was well
satisfied with the outcome, believing that
San Diego did well to keep within gun
shot of the giants who confronted them.
Berkeley averaged 165 in weight and San
Diego 152.

TIE SICK ARE Si
The Depression Caused by
Disease Is Dispelled.
DISEASES, ESPECIALLY THOSE OP
a chronic nature, cannot be cured ex.
cept by a treatment that strikes directly
at the root of the trouble. The new, origi-
nal an marvelous method of treating dis.
eases mat is pursued at the State Electro-
Medical Institute is one that never fails.
The salutary effects of the treatment on
any disease are at once perceived and a
speedy and permanent cure is invariably
made in every case.
The treatment is medical and electrical
combined. The peculiar method of ad-
ministering these two great curative reme-
dies is a new, original, scientific discovery
of the Institute. It is used exclusively by
them and the most amazing results are
accomplished in the treatment and cure of
all diseases.
The Institute is splendidly equipped
with every device i known to the scientific
world for administering medical electric-
ity, including large Static, Faradic and
Galvanic batteries, Electric Beits, Body
Batteries and a great variety of other
electric appliances that are manufactured
and used exclusively by the Institute in
their ' Electro-Medical . treatment. By
means of these electric batteries and ap-
pliances, vitalizing, life-giving electric
currents are used to aid in sending the
Institute medicines directly to the dis-
eased organs and diseased parts of this
body. : . ,T
The medicines prescribed at the InstÃ
tute are perfect laboratory triumphs, for-
mulated from a true appreciation of the
medicinal wants of the body; and when
these medicines are aided in their recu-
perating and healing work by electricity
scientifically applied, every symptom of
disease is rapid dispelled, the patient
soon regains perfect health and strength,
while the depression caused by disease is
displaced by the happiness and pleasure
that is the natural heritage of those twin
blessings, "a sound mind in a sound
body."
If you are sick or ailing, if you want to
know what id the matter with you, and if
you want to be cured, you should resort
without delay to the State Electro-Medical
Institute. The Institute TREATS AND
CURES Diseases of the Heart, Brain and
Nerves, .Blood Diseases, Bneumatism, Ca-
tarrh, Kidney Diseases, Throat Diseases,

WRITEâ If you live out of town and
cannot visit the Institute this need not
deprive you of the benefits of the wonder-
ful Institute treatment. Patients can be
cured at home just as well as when per-
sonally treated at the Institute. It is
only necessary to write a plain statement -<
of your condition, explaining your feel-
ings and symptoms as clearly as possible,
and from this the Institute doctors will be
able to accurately diagnose, correctly pre-
scribe for and permanently cure any case.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Dec. 30.- xhe
Bankers' Exchange Bank went into the
hands of Bank Examiner Kenyon this
morning. Depositors nad drawn out
about $35,000 the past few days, and
President Field decided to ciose up, though
he had in the vaults nearly 30 per cent of
ihe money on deposit. The bank is less
than a year old, having been incorporated
last May. Its loans and discounts are
$68 000, its capital $30,000, and its deposits
about $40,000. Depositors will be paid in
full and a fair sum will be left for stock
holders.
George Maxwell, president of the North
ern Trust Company, made application this
morning for a receiver for the company.
A. R. MoGill, ex-Governor of Minnesota,
is president of the organization. The fol
lowing statement was issued :
This company has for some time been seek
ing to realize upon its loans and securities,
and has until now been able to maintain itself
without difficulty, but the present depressed
condition of finances is such that it has been
unable to realize as it had hoped, and the
suspension within two or t&ree days of some
of the banks of the city, in which was depos
ited some of the available funds, has some
what embarassed it in the transaction of its
business. Independent of its assets, the com
pany has a list of responsible stockholders who
are abundantly able to make good any defi
ciency that may result fror= depreciation in
value of its assets, so that the creditors of the
company need tiave no apprehension as to the
ultimate result. Their claims will all be paid
in full, even if the company is not permuted
to immediately resume business as is now
hoped.
The liabilities of the company are about
$500,000. Judge Jamieson issued a re
straining order returnable at 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning.
Judge B ndel signed an order this:
morning appointing Judge A. Ueland re
ceiver of the Washington Bank, under a
bond of $200,000. Ti:e petition recites that
the bank has $27,774 more liabilities than
assets.
D.'puty Comptroller Coffin is still in

The Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank is

The bai;k issued a statement saying it had

MUST NOT IGNORE SILVER.
Representative Republicans of Wyoming
Favor Allison for Secretary of
ihe Treasury.
CANTON, Ohio, Dec. 30. âThe most
notable visitors to-day were Senator Clark
and Representative Frank W. Mondell cf
Wyoming, who are silver men, but re
mained in the Republican party and sup
ported Major McKinley. They told him
they would act with the party in Congress
and give hearty support to the proposed
tariff legislation. Senator Clark stated,
however, that in Wyoming and the other
mountain States the silver sentiment had
increased rather than diminished since
the election, and that it was of the highest
importance to the Republican party to
enact legislation providing for an inter
national monetary conference to secure
the fuller use of silver by common agree
ment among the leading commercial na
tions. Both Mr. Clark and Mr. Mondell
insisted that if this was not done, if the
promises of the St. Louis platform, in
reference to bimetalism were not made
good, and if times did not sensibly im
prove within the next four years, the
Republicans could hadly expect to recover
the ground they had lost in the West, or
to carry the next Presidential election.
Senator Clark declared that the selection
ot Senator Sherman or any man wLo is
looked upon as a gold monometallist for
the oftice of Secretary of the Treasury
would be a serious political error and
bring disaster upon the Republican party
in the Western and Middle States. He
said Senator Alli9on would be looked
upon with favor by the bimotallists as a
Cabinet possibility.
Major and Mrs. McKinley entertained
about eighty of their friends to-night.
Major McKinley may spend a few days in
Cleveland next week.
ALUMINUM FOR AIRSHIPS.
Order Placed With a Pitt&burg Firm by
the Pacific Aerial Navigation
Company.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. 30.â The Pitts
burz Times to-morrow will say: The
stories recently reported from San Fran
cisco of a company engaged in the opera
tion of successful airships are apparently
borne out by an order, accompanied by
detailed specifications, given to a Pitts
burg firm. The Pittsburg Reductfon Com
pany will ship iv a few days $1000 worth
of manufactured aluminum to the Pacific
Aerial Navigation Company at San Fran
cisco, to be used in the construction of
airships. The order was given about two
weeks ago. Aluminum, being a very
light ineta!, ia especially adapted for use
in airships.
No description of the airship accom
panied the order, further than such as re
laSed to the metal works. It is probable,
however, from the length of the tubes,
etc., that the whole machine will be about
151 feet long and will accommodate several
persons. It will be bujlt on the aeroplane
system, and will have two wings eighteen
,eet wide and a rudder shaped like a bird's
tail.

Ones Into Voluntary Liquidation.
BEATRICE, Nebk., Dec. 30.â A permit
was granted to-day by the State Banking
Board allowing the Farmers' and Mer
chants' State Bank of this city to go into
voluntary liquidation. The bank was or
ganized January 14, 1893, with a capital
stock of $50,000. The cause assigned lor
this move is the difficulty of realizing a
profit in this line of business.

A SOFT MARK FOR SHARPERS.
Head of a Brewery Syndicate Having
Money to Invest in Mines Is Thrown
Into Prison.
CHICAGO, 111.. Dec. 30.â Valentine
Hoffman, connected with the Brewer &
aottman brewing company, wno says ue
was picked out as a "soft mark" in mining
deals, was arrested yesterday, on a war
rant sworn out by C. R. Palmer and issued
by Justice Hall, charging conspiracy and
obtaining money under false pretences.
Tne warrant was served at his office and
he gave bail .or a hearing on January 8.
Mr. Hoffman to-day will swear out war
rants for the three men said to be con
cerned in his arrestâ C. R. Palmer, a
raining broker, and *'Judi*e" Reeves and
Mr. Scott, his associates. These men,
the brewer says, caused him to spend
nearly $1000 upon them because of their
representations to have mining property
for sale.
Palmer claimed in his complaint that
Hoffman represented himself as the head
of a syndicate of brewers who wanted gold
mines, and that upon his promise to buy
the proper at Bowie, Ariz., for $200,000,
he spent $1350 to prove, the mine was up
to the prospectus. He says Hoffman then
back? d out, and would not pay his ex
penditures on his account.
Ali- 1h man s.ivs he wantoH in hnv ft
mine, and the broker said he had the
Bowie property listed for $200,000, and
would as<ree to send an expert to Arizona
to examine it. Mr. Buell, a specialist,
was given the mission, and he was in
structed to go under the name of J. E.
Fowler to hide his identity. When he
reached the mine Mr. O'Connor, it is said,
refused to let him examine the property.
The mine -owner, however, knew Mr.
Buell, and allowed h.iru to examine the
property and came bacn to Chicago with
him. That was several months ago. In
the cflicf of the brewery hoth of the men
met Palmer and his friends, and O'Con
nor, the brewer says, denounced them as
swindlers and impostors. Hoffman says
he ordered them out of his office.

HARRISBURG, Pa., Dec. 30.â E. A.
Van Valkenberg, manager of headquar-
ters in this city of John Wanamaser, can
didate for United States Senator, was
arrested to-night on the charge of at
tempting to bribe Webster Weyss, a mem
ber of the Legislature. Mr. Van Valken
berg refused to give bail and demanded a
hearing, which will be given him to-mor
rew at Hornersville. Mr. Van Valkenberg
claims that his arrest is simply a move in
the political game which is now going on

SPRINGFIELD, Ohio, Dec. 30.â A
Cleveland (Ohio) special says: Rev. H.
M. Moyer, a Baptist minister, late of Cali
fornia, called at the office of the United
States Marshal on Monday afternoon and
recited a tale of woe. He said he had
been corres'-gkiiding with Mrs. Mary White
of Euclid ana contemplated marriage with
her. He feared that his letters to her had
been intercepted and wanted' the United
States authorities to "ict in the matter.
An investigation by a reporter shows
that Mrs. \Vhite cared nothing for the min
ister, but had married a man named Lan
der in this city. Rev. Mr. Moyer, on read
ing of the nuptials while at his home in
San Francisco, hastened to this city. :
Mrs. Lander says she had received all
Mr. Mover's letters but had cast them
aside unanswered. Rev. Mr. Moyer is
gray haired and is apparently between 50
and 60 years of age. Mrs. Lander is some
years his junior, but has a grown-up son.
Mr. Moyer lived in Cleveland up to about
one year ago.

Pronounced Guilty of the
Murder of Bessie
Little.
Relatives of the Condemned Man
Break Down When H s
Fate Is Learned.
Jurors Dcide That He Shot the
Young Woman and Threw Her
Body Into a River.
DAYTON, Ohio, Dec. 30.â The jury was
out just two hours when it returned a
verdict finding Albert J. FrantS guilty of
murder in the first degree for killing his
sweetheart, Bessie Little. When the ver
dict was announced Mattie Frantz, *he
sister of the prisoner, wept bitterly. The
Rev. Isaac Frantz, who sat beside her,
wrung his hands and cried. The poor old
father' was not at his son's side, having
gone to another room.
Cornelius Frantz, another brother, gave
a shrill cry and fell fainting to the floor.
In the meantime the prisoner broke down
and wept. The sight of the distress of his
relatives was more than he could bear.
Frantz's attorneys say they will file a mo
tion for a new trial.
Jessie Little was the adopted daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. Peter E. Little. She was
20 years old. She was a lovable, hand
some woman and attracted 8 number of
admirers. She met Albert J. Frantz, and
their intimacy caused trouble at her
home. She left and went to live at a
boarding-house.
On Thursday, August 27, Miss Little
left her boarding-house in a great hurry,
saying to Mrs. Freese, who kept it, she
was going to taKe a ride with Albert
Frantz. She met him at the Boulevard
Park. Frantz suggested, as he admitted.
that they go to the new bridge across
Stillwater River. This was in a remote,
unfrequented part of the city. He told
Bessie to look up the river while he looked
down the river for the boat.
Just as they were going up the incline
to the bridge and while the girl was look
ing up the river she received two shots in
the head from a revolver, which killed her
instantly. The hor3e jumped and ran
across the bridge before Frantz could con
trol him. When ha returned he afterward
confessed he saw the prostrate form of the
girl lying on the bridge.
He picked her up and threw her into
the river, and the revolver after her. His
explanation was that the girl committed
suicide, and he being frightened and not
knowing what to do, threw her into the
river.
In a week's time her body was found in
the river by a bather. The Coroner and
the police beean to hunt for the murderer
and Frantz was arrested. The bullets in
the girl's head were discovered, and it was
shown that Frantz had bought a revolver
on August 13, and the bullets in the girl's
bead just fitted the kind of revolver
Frantz bought.

grocers, and John W. Kerrick, son of the

PORTLAND, Or., c Dec. 30.â 1t was by

went out: â¢ As he approached the figure he
saw it was a man garbed in only a night

GOLD STRIKE NEAR SEATTLE.
Ore Assaying Sixty- Five Dollars to ihe
Ton Discovered on Mount
Sic.
SEATTLE, Wash., Dec. 30.â What pur
ports to be a great gold discovery has been
made on Mount Sic, two miles from North
Bend, this county, by ex-County Commis
sioner W. H. Taylor of Fall City. The
find consists of a three-foot mineral vein
composed in part of a fourteen-inch ledge
of white galena ore, assaying $65 to the
ton. Nothing approaching this discovery
has ever been found during all the pros
pecting done in King County. While an
effort is being made to keep the find quiet,
much excitement has been aroused by the
report. Fifty or more have filed locations
since Monday morning. The discoveries
appear much more valuable from the fact
that th" Seattle and International Rail
road runs withir. less than two miles of

Vines.
me Kepreseniauve win rresent an
Argument for the Proposed
Import Tax.
FRESNO, Cal., Dec. 30.â The joint meet
ing of the Chamber of Commerce, the
Hunared Thousand Club and the raisin
growers this atternoon, to supply Con
gressman Bowers with information he
desires relative to the industry, in order
that ho might present as strong an argn
ment as possible for a sufficient import
duty on the product, was well attended,
notwithstanding the rain. The assemblage
organized by electing O. J. Woodward
president and E. F. Bern hard secretary.
Those present were representative business
men of the city and owners and managers
of vineyards.
After a discussion of considerable length
it was decided to ask Congress to impose
a tariff of 3 cents a pound on raisins, and
a resolution to that effect was to-night
telegraphed to Mr. Bowers at Washington.
The meeting was unanimous in the
opinion that 3 cents would be a reason
able duty. The present rate, 1% cents, is
too low to place the local products in fair
competition with the imported in the
Eastern markets. Several of the growers
submitted accounts of expenditures anil
receipts of their vineyards for a season,
and it was found that the cost of placing
raisins in the sweatbox ranged from 2}4 to
3 cents a pound. W. H. Hodgkins' ac
count showed that in the past year he ex
pended $51 to every ton of raisins ready
for market and he had conducted his vine
yard on a very economical basis. Other
accounts averaged about the same and
some higher. Considering the heavy
freight charges to the East it can readily
be seen that the home industry needs sub
stantial protection.
These points were brought out forcibly
in a discussion, which was participated in
by T. C. White, W. F. Forsey, H. A. Tre
veylan, John S. Dore and others. There
was not hint of party lines, all being
united in the effort to have established a
rate of duty the industry deserves. Messrs.
O. J. Woodward, W. F. Forsey, A. L.
Hobbs and E. F. Bernard were selected as
a committee to telegraph the action of the
meeting to the Congressional representa
tive. The following is a copy of the mes
sage sent to-night:
At a joint meeting of the Chamber of Com
merce, the Hundred Thousand Club and the
raisin-growers of Fresno County a resolution
was unanimously adopted favoring 3 cents
per pound as a duty on raisins, currants and
dried grape?. Other information requested in
your letter will be forwarded by mall.
The committee will meet tormorrow to
examine the accounts kept by the various
vineyardists, and from these the answers
to the questions asked by Mr. Bowers will
be compiled. This will be done with all
possible dispatch, as the Congressman de
sires the data immediately. The Repre
sentative has announced his intention of
making a vigorous light in behalf of the
industry. He appreciates the adverse con
ditions which beset the growers and the
need of an import duty on raisins which
will give tiie industry deserving encour
agement. There is reasou to hope that be
will succeed in raising the rate to that
asked by the producers.
TESTIFIES AGAINST SCHWEIZER.
Witness De Marias Says the Fresno Har
ness-Dealer Tr.ed to Hire Him
to Commit Murder.
FRESNO. Cal., Dec. 30.â The Grand
Jury is now at work in earnest investigat
ing the mystery surrounding the attempt
ed murder of Solomon Lehman, mill
owner, last summer, in which the name
of Charles Schweizer, one of the city's
leading merchants, has been very unpleas
antly connected. The witnesses before the
jury to-day were T. De Marias, who says
that Schweizer tried to hire him to kill
Lehman, and to whom John Barker, now
dead, confessed to the shooting. ,
Mrs. Lehraann, the wife of the intended
victim of the conspiracy; Carolina Leh
mann, who received the charge of shot
meant for her father; Al Henry, who
alleges that John Harrison, the detective
who worked up the case against Schweizer, j
made a proposition to him for hush j
money; and Constable William Shaw,
who has made some investigations of the
case.
Schweizer may be called to testify to
morrow. Harrison and Lehmann are
still on the coast, and it cannot be ascer

PERU'S INSURRECTION CRUSHED.
Chief Jacobo's Indian Rebels Fall Before
.. the Machine Guns of the
Regular Troops.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Dec. 30.â The
peculiar uprising â¢ among aborigines of
Peru-descendants of the Incas â has re
sulted disastrously for them. In the dis
trict surrounding Huanta, and in the
Mariquita Mountains, the Indians arose
almost in a night, and wrought havoc
before the Government troops could be
sent against them. The leader of the
rebels, old Jacobo, a wily old man of 70,
displayed a cunning that would have done
credit to a civil zed general. He led his
men into battle, and though defeated at
Huanta by the machine guns of the
troop?, the Indians displayed such bravery
that they ; won ; the admiration of the
soldiers. Jacobo retreated into the Mara
quitan, burning and ' killing as he went,
leaving the country black and barren oi
provisions. The Indians even filled up
the water holes as they went forcing the
pursuing soldiers to great extremities and
delay. â  , Â£ .'-., 'â  . ;\ Â.. /I 1 - : Â_'.â ' .. .
The Government sent Colonel Parra,
an experienced Indian fighter, against
Jacobo, wiih a good force of infantry,
avalry and one or two Gatling ; guns.
The soldiers marched with rapidity, in
spite of difficulties and found the Indians,
j numbering over 4500, in various camps
n the foothills. One camp after another
was routed, but the Indians scattered
only to reunite on the flanks of the troops.
Jacobo am bushed a detachment of soldiers
under Captain Lagartija and killed all
but two men. .
Colonel Parra found that he could do
nothing by keeping his men in one large
body, and accordingly separated them
into four or five small parties, each sup
plied with a Gatling and escorted by
cavalry. These parties penetrated into the
mountains in pursuit of the savages,
whom they encountered into several
camps. Battle was given by the Indians
against the small forces of soldiers, with
the result that the deadly work of the
Gatlings so depleted the rebels' ranks
that old Jacobo was hunted down with a
few hundred braves. Colonel Para united
his command in such position as to rake
the camp and thus practically the entire
Indian population taking part in the up
rising was exterminated.
Colonel Parra returned to Huanta after
his victory, and sent word to the Govern
ment, which was received December 3.

TWICE VICTORIOUS
Triumph in Battle With
Troops Sent Against
Them.
Down'all of President Borda's
Unpopular Government
Imminent.
General Dirz's Head Demanded Be*
cause the Insurgents Defeated
His Forces.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Dec. 30.â South
American mails received to-day indicate
the speedy downfall of the Uruguayan
Government. President Borda has proven
very unpopular. The two political fac
tions â the Reds , supportine Borda, and
the Whites, sympathizing with the revo
lutionistsâhave reached the fighting stage.
Several battles took place early this
month. Borda has sent his Minister of
War. General Diaz, to the front, with two
battalions, to take personal charge of the
campaign, and is said to have exacted
that officer's head as the penalty of de
feat. Owing to the defeat of the Govern
ment forces at Capilla de Farruco by
Aparcia Saraiva, the friends of the Govern
ment are fast deserting it, and rumors
were abroad in Montevideo of the gather
ing of men high in political power looking
to the removal of President Idiarte Borda
and the substitution of a triumvirate.
The Government troops, in their disas
trous encounter with Saraiva, were com
manded by Colonel Rodriguez. The force
comprised the Fourth Cavairy an I the
Durazno police. Rodriguez was killed and
his forct routed. The regiment wns re
duced by one-half in killed and wounded.
The insurgent loss is unknown.
After this battle the Government hur
ried troops forward and a still more de
cisive battle between Saraiva and Major
Barriola was fought. The Government
announced that Saraiva had been killed
and his force dispersed, but &araiva re
turned again with a larger force than ever,
augmented by troops that had been raised
in Argentine. The uprising now extends
to the districts of Facuaremba, Cerro
Largo, Sallo, Paisandu, Artigas and Con
cordia.
The White party is continually receiving
additions of arms and ammunition. An
expedition of insurgents evaded the
authorities of Argentine and sailed from
Punta Chica, Uruguay, arriving safely
with a large supply of dynamite, Win
chester and Chassepot rifles and anima
tion.
The British cruisers Piemonte and Ret
ribution arrived at Montevideo on Decem
ber 4 to guard British interests. The
United States cruiser Lancaster sailed
from Buenos Ayres on the 3d for Monte
video, to represent this country at the
center of trouble.
The city of Montevideo is practically
deserted and trouble is feared thereat any
time. The Government palace and mu
nicipal headqnarters are doubly guarded.
The Government has declared martial law
all over the republic and the National
Guards have been mobilized for service in
the field.
The steamer San Martin arrived at Mon
tevideo on December 4 and was fired upon
by the Government troops, who were in
three steam launches in the harbor. The
San Martin hailed from Buenos Byres and
carried passengers and cargo. It was sus
pected of secretly aiding the rebels. The
captain protested to the Government.
The Montevideo public is almost a unit
in wishing the downfall of President
Borda. The White party is declared to
be the party of peace, honeaty and reform.
Borda is alleged to have been guilty of
gross malfeasance in office.

MODERN METHODS
IN THE SCHOOLS
Noted Educators Address
the State Teachers at
San Jose.
Professor Howison Broaches the
Subject of Religion in the
Classroom.
Says the Instructor Should Have the
Character to Inspire the
Pupil.
FAN JOSE, Cal., Dec 30.â This morn
ing's session of tho California Teachers'
Association was devoted to round-table
work. There was the same large attend
ance that characterized yesterday's meet
ines, and the various rooms were crowded.
The work in English conducted in the
training- hall of the Normal School attract
ed great attention. The subject under dis
cussion was "English Considered as a
Continuous Course." Professor Charles
M. Gayley of the University of California
was chairman, and introduced the subject
â with a talk on "The Purpose of the Con
ference."
"English in the Grammar Schoolâprin
ciples of selections and choice of reading"
(authors and text), was the subject treated
by F. E. Perham of Santa Ana. He be
lieved the child should be taken along in
a way to interest it by telling a story and
not giving it too much detail. The pupils
in the lower Erades should not be given
details to the point of burdening, but only
details sufficient to explain the story so
they could understand it. He believed
the best way to teach English was to give
the child literature of a nature suitable to
its age and understanding.
Anna C. Murphy of Berkeley believed
the child in the lower grades should be
taught English by giving it a birdseye
view of the best things in literature suit
able to its age. It would learn composi
tion and grammar and see the beauty of
language and at the same time grasp the
fact that there were better things ahead
for it if it only mastered the things at
hand.
"English in the Grammar School â se
quence of studies and methods," was dis
cussed by Charles E. Markham and Eliza
beth H. Packard of Oakland. T. L. Hea- |
ton of Eureka and liillin E. Blanchard of I
San Francisco treated "English in the
High School." Both talks aroused con- '
siderable discussion of various features of i
the subject. "What we can learn from
Germany in teaching the native language
and literature" had been assigned to Pro
fessor Ewald Flugel of Stanford, but he
could not De present. As a result the
Bubject was omitted. Numerous persons
gave talks on the general subject, among
them Miss Helen Wright of S^n Jose Nor
mal, Mrs. Frick, Los Angeles, and others.
The bubject proved one of interest to the j
end, and many teachers were loth to drop
it even at a quarter of an hour past noon
time.
"Classics in the High School,'' with Pro
fessor Edward B. Ciapp of the University
of Calilornia presiding as chairman, was
the subject in room I). The papers were
brief and were generally and freely dis
cussed. Miss Frances Hodgkinson, Girls'
High School, San Francisco, read a paper
on "Methods oi Teaching the Wr.ting ot
Latin," E. A. Burnt il o. Oakland spoke of |
"The Place and Treatment ot Virgil in
the Preparatory Cause" and Professor A. J
T. Murray of Stanford talked of "Tne j
Teaching of Elementary Greek." Profes- \
sor W. A. Merrill of the University of
California entertained tlie teachers by a j
discussion ou "Some Objects in Transla- |
tions." Professor L. R. Smiih of San
Jose High School spoke of "The Perma
nent Value of the Classics in Secondary
Education."
"German in the Schools" proved at
tractive to mar.y. Those who spoke under
this general subject were Professor Julius
Goebel, Dr. Jordan of Stanford, Professor
Putzker of the University of California,
Professor Riedman and others.
In room F a large number of teachers
gathered to discuss "Manual Training in
the School." Professor Keyes of Berke
ley was in charge as chairman, and there i
were reports of the outlook tor manual
training in the schools of the cities of this
State with discussions of plans, methods !
and advantages of the training. "Science {
in the Schools" was another Interesting
subject. Professor O. P. Jenkins was
chairman of the "Hound Table" and there
were papers and discussions by W. E.
Setchell, Frank Dunn of University of
California, Fernando Sanford, C. H. Gil
bertand Professor Kellogg of Stanford.
"The Kindergarten in the Schools" was
discussed in the Assembly Hall. Dr. W.
T. Harris of Washington addresssd the
audience on the subject, and conducted
the discussion, which was general.
Tne discussion of "Interest and Charac
ter as Educational Motives" by Professor
G. H. Howison of the University of Cali
fornia at the general session of the associa
tion this afternoon introduced the most I
profound topic which has yet received j
consideration and proved to be of absorb- !
interest. Professor Howison stated that j
his remarks were but a continuation and |
elaboration of those uttered at the session j
of the association one year ago upon the j
Barue subject. He referred in caustic
terms to tne position taken by some of the
members cf the laculty of Harvard College
that "interest" was the fundamental
principle involved in elementary educa
tion. The question, he said, was the
deepest which faced the human race.
The great realities oi religion, he claimed,
were based upon the conclusion arrived
at, and it would be impossible to keep
religion out of the question, no matter
what political side a person might take.
Alter showing briefly the results of
"interest" being the chief motive of the
pupil and explaining its selfish tendency,
the speaker referred to tbe influence which
the reciprocal interdependence of the body
and brain exercised. He reviewed the
manner in which the American people, as
a class, had come to place themselves on |
the side of character more than mere in- j
terest. To illustrate this, he referred to
the principles which had governed the
Puritans and the cavaliers of Jamestown.
The Puritan, he said, represented charac
ter and the cavalier self-interest. Tbe
Puritan principle was the deeper of the
two and has triumphed.
â¢'Time, space and will are forms of pure
pelf-activity of the mind, and character
belongs to this realm." he said. "There
is no difference between intellect and will.
The will of God is also the will of man,
except that the will in man is conscious
by sin, which i 3 not known in God, who
has the perfect, pure will. To be righte
ous is to will the perfect truth. Man can
only will the partial truth. Mathematics
and natural science are infallible, but not
complete or perfect truths. The whole
hone of man is based upon natural truth
not being complete truth. The man who
has tbe sight to view hiniseli as a member
of the lepublic of God has character.
"You do not educate the pure spirit.
The teacher should see that the power of
the pure spirit, that is original, that is the
gift of creation, that is tbe spirit of God,
is not hindered. They should not com
mit the folly of endeavoring to build up
intelligence but to aid the intelligence in
bearing the burden of experience. Char
acter make* the man. The teacher
should have the character to inspire
the pupil. The teacher should not tbink
that: the victory of the soul over
sense is in conflict with self interest.
There is no limit to the symbols by which
we can get to religion and realize that we
are an eternal spirit and there is a Father
spirit, without, which the world becomes
unintelligible.'
Mrs. Mary Weaver McCauley sane a
vocal so.'o, which was much applauded,
after which Dr. W. T. Harris delivered' a
short address upon 'tFive. Windows of the
Soul." These he designated as literature,
grammar, mathematics, geography and
history, and he entered into an extended
review cf the value of each in education.
A telegram was read from the Wiscon
sin Teachers' Association, in session in
Milwaukee, inviting the California Asso
ciation to attend its next meeting. This
was answered with expressions of thanks.
This evening the teachers enjoyed a liop
in the parlors of the St. James Hotel. It
was a very largely attended and brilliant
affair.
At the Vendome a banquet was given by
the members of the State Teachers' Asso
ciation affiliated witn the University o f
California. President Martin Kellogg was
toastmaster. Among those who responded
to toasts were David Starr Jordan, A. H.
Randall, Samuel T. Black, J. W. Linscort,
Milton E. Blanchard, James Forshay El
mer E. Brown and J. D. Pierce.
The meetings of the association will
close with the session to-morrow forenoon.
There will be papers upon the following
subjects: "Chinese Education â Past,
Present and Future"; "Sience Work Be
low the High School"; "Psychology as a
Science," and â¢â¢Modern Psychology in the
Normal School."

SAN JOSE, Cal., Dec. 30.â Charles E.
Stevens, a '49 pioneer and an old resident
of this county, died at his residence at 822
East Julian street about 2 o'clock this
morning. He was born at Newbury, Vt.,
in 1822. When a boy he went to St. Louis,
Mo., and in 1848 he lelt there with a party
of twenty to come to California by ox
team. Alter many hardships the party
arrived in this State in 1849, and Stevens
at once went to the mines in Mariposa
County. In 1862 he removed i& this city.
For a number of years he baa coarge of
the streei-sprinklinc in this city, for which
the citizens paid according to front, and
became well known as "Charley, the
Waterman. 1 ' Stevens was an exempt fire
man and a member of the Society of Pio
neers. A widow survives him.

EUREKA, Cal., Dec. 30.â T. J. Gilbert,
secretary of the Non-partisan Taxpayers'
League of San Bernardino County, called
a meeting to be held here this evening to
organize a similar league here. The ob
ject of the league is the reduction of taxa
tion by legislation, to reduce salaries of
county officers, abolish certain unneces
sary State commissions and to ecr>nomize
in government expenses. Humboiilt
County being of the same class as San
Bernardino â the twelfiti class â is there
fore asked to co-operate.
Tlie meeting was attended by all of the
principal business men and property
owners of the ciiy and the proposition
was enthusiastically received. A com
mittee of five, with J. W. Henderson,
president of the Humboldt County Bank,
as chairman, was appointed to prepare for
the organization of a league and call a
mass-meeting at tbe earliest possible mo
ment, and in tbe meantime a memorial
will be sent to the Humboldt representa
tives in the Legislature advising them of
the movement.

NIAGARA IN HARNESS.
'he Great Falls earning. Money for
Klectrlc-Koad Stockholder*.
Trolley-cars are now run in Buffalo by
electricity furnished by dynamos operated
by water from Niagara Falls, twenty-three
miles off. The experiment has cost a great
deal of money, but it is a success. It has
been watched with much interest. Scien
tific men have visited the works, and
have been astonished at the mag
nitude of the undertaking. The pos
sibility of transmitting electricity to
a distance has, of course, been a fact
for years, but the question whether, in
view of the loss of power, it would pay to
do so, has been an important one. If the
power can be sufficiently conserved,
enough can be generated at Niagara to do
a vast deal of work at Chicago, 500 miles
away, and at New York, which is nearly
that distance. These are matters of detail
to be worked out. It has been demon
strated that the vast volume of water
goinÂ»- over the Jails at Niagara can be
made to do effective work.- Bo far as the
present experiment is concerned, the
diminution of water is not perceptible,
and it would doubtless take many tunnels
to carry off enough to reduce the quan
tity in any great degree.
Foreigners often complain that Ameri
cans are too much disposed to look at na
ture in a practical way. They want every
thing to do work, to pay, so to say, lor the
privilege of living. Niagara Falls is the
most beautiful sight of its kind in the
world. It draws thousands of visitors
every year. There are very few Americans
unpoetic enough to desire to destroy the
beauty of the falls, and it is not likely that
this will be done, for the law would inter
pose if that were threatened.
But the practical American says, as
there are millions of gallons of water
going to waste, why not make me of this
water, especially as it can be done to serve
a valuable purpose?â Baltimore American.
The Cause of Death.
in 1827 Mr. Zea, Colombian Minister in
England, died suddenly. He was insured
in various offices, and rumor said lie had
shot himself. A meeting of the insurance
boards was held, and the directors were
talking the matter over, when Dr. M
appeared, who was the company's medical
referee, as well as Mr. Zea's own physi
cian.
"Ah ! now yon can tell us the true cause
oi Zea's death."
"Certainly I can," said the doctor
solemnly, "because I attended him."
Here he paused, and was surprised to
find that his merely preliminary remark
was hilariously received as a solution of
the whole question.â Household Words.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1896.
FIRST TO SAIL
INTO OUR PORT
Arrival of an Old Painting
of Captain Dorr, the
Bold Navigator.
His Ship the Otter Carried the
First American Flag Into
Monterey Bay.
Characteristic Deeds of an Intrepid
Mariner Who Came When Wash
ington Was President.
Colonel A. S. Hubbard, secretary of the
California Historical Society, has received
from the East an old and exceptionally
valuable oil painting of a man whose life
for many years was closely woven with
California, and in whom all Califorruans
have a special interest.
The picture is of Captain Ebenezer Dorr,
The Otter, the First United States Vessel to Enter This Port.
who commanded the ship Otter, which was
the first American vessel to enter port on
tbe Pacific coast. A picture is also at
hand of the famous ship.
Captain Ebenezer Dorr died at Roxbury,
Masa., his former home, January 1, 1847.
He was then 84 years and 12 aays old. The
ship Otter, which be had commanded, was
in the Northwest fur trade. A letter to
Colonel Hubbard from Morri3Dorr, a rela
tive at Roxbury, says that Miss Caroline
Dorr, who died suddenly September 12,
1895, had always expressed a wish that this
picture should go to tbe California His
torical Society.
William Heath Davis, in his "Sixty
Years in California," has referred to the
indomitable navigator, it is pointed out,
incorrectly as Captain Dows. The period
in question was October tj, 1797, almost
ICO years ago now, when the captain
forcibly put on shore in California for
eigners from his vessel.
Boricar was the Spanish Governor of
California in those early days. Ho wrote
July 15, 1796, referring to Captain Dorr.
The Otter was from Boston, and was the
first bearing the stars and stripes to an
chor In California waters. She had made
her appearance at Monterey after a north
ern fur cruise. It is stated tnat the vessel
was possibly identical with the Sea Otter,
which was on this coast in early times.
Captain Dorr, according to the history
of those days, created some excitement oy
CAPTAIN EBENEZER DORR, Who Sailed the American Ship
Otter Into Monterey One Hundred Years Ago.
[Drawn from the painting forwarded here for the California Historical Society.]
leaving California with convict stowaways
of Botany Bay. Dorr, Perkins. Lamb
and Boardraun, all of Roxbury ami vicin
ity, were sea captain*, who after Dorr's
first arrival on the coast, made fortunes in
the fur trade.
The Otter carried six guns and twenty
six men. She arrived in Monterey on
October 29, after having cruised in the
vicinity for nearly a week. Having ob
tained wood and water freely supplied by
the Spaniards on showing a passport
from General Washington, she sailed
November 6.
Dorr had asked to land some English
sailors who secretly boarded his vessel at
Port Saxon. This was refused, but he
landed them anyway at the point of pis
tols, and put off. The men were after
ward* employed at 19 cents a day at car
pentering and blacksrnitbing, and Gov
ernor Boricar was fain to give them up, but
nevertheless, according to custom, had to
forward them to Cadiz by way of San Bias.
"The only foreign craft," according to
an account that seems indisputable, "ittat
toucned at Monterey during the decade,
were those of Vancouver in 1792-4, the
Englisn ship Providence under Uroughton
in 1796, the American Otter under Dorr
in the same year, and an unknown vessel
that anchored in the bay in 1800."
Governor Boricar was the Spanish execu
tive of Talifornia who first introduced
Spanish schools here. He was very wroth
that Captain Dorr should land the Eng
lish sailors here contrary to his will.
When He found how bandy they were,
however, in working in wood and iron he
was greatly pleased, and was sorry he
eventually had to lose them.
Captain Dorr seems to have been a man
of rare strength of character, a fitting
tigure for the strange primeval days on
this coast. The picture of the captain will
be placed by Colonel Hubbard in the
Chamber cf Commerce for a few days
prior to being placed permanently in the
rooms of the California Historical So
ciety.
EAGER TO AID CUBA.
Friends ot the Insurgents Anxions to
Hear From Palma â Have Asked
for Instructions.
Messrs. Mascherini and Jones, leaders of
a movement to render the Cuban insur
gents aid from this city are becoming very
anxious to hear from General Palma, the
New York leader of the Junta, to whom
they wrote for instructions some twelve
days ago. They became bo nervous over
the matter yesterday that they wired the
New York managers of the Junta to
know whether their letter had been re
ceived. They asked for a prompt reply,
that they might know what to do and how
to talk to those dependent on them for in
struction in matters Cuban.
'The great annoyance of the matter,''
said Mr. Mascherini last night, "is that
a great many people have read about this
movement and the part Jones and I are
taking in it, and they â will naturally begin
to think we are a pair tff fakers if we do
not produce credentials pretty soon. How
ever, we make no pretenses of having any
authority whatever, and we refuse to head
a movement or collect a penny until we
have absolute authority. Whether we get
that authority or not is the thing that
will determine whether we do anythine.
''We have gone far enough in our inves
tigations to learn beyond question that
there are many people in this State who
are ready and anxious to do something to
help little Cuba. They believe the Cubans
are oppressed and that tbe Spaniards are
sure to lose. Men of all ranks are offering
their service*, and they are in this matter
earnestly. li'we once get some color of
authority there would be little delay in
organizing something substantial."
It is interebti:ie to see the young men
who have espoused this movement. They
assemble about the Mason-street head
quarters every day. and, standing in
nervous groups, discuss the war with
great interest. Their implacable enemies
are the loyal Spaniards of the City, who
roundiy denounce them in their news
papers and elsewhere. The volunteers do
not seem to care for this. They bide their
time and preserve their tempers, hoping
to raise a substantial company and money
within sixty days.

NEW LAWS WANTED

Public Sentiment in Various
Districts on Political
Needs.
More Lunatic Asylums, Leper
Hospitals and Normal Schools
Demanded.
Amendments to tbe Wright Irrigation
L w and a R^ce With the Un
scalped Coyotes.
More than usual activity was noted in
the political hive last night, the hotel lob
bies beir^ well tilled with statesmen, dis
cussing bills which they or their friends
were about to present to the Legislature.
The topics were those which appealed to
self-interest. The Assemblyman from
Santa Cactus County who (rants a branch
State asylum for lunatics established in
his county was so earnest upon the sub
ject that many of his bearers expressed
the hope that he would be the first inmate.
He himself has a similar bope, but he
would like the title of superintendent in
addition.
If you should talk to him about the
Monroe doctrine or the Cuban war he
would gaze upon you in astonishment.
The people of Cactus County have elected
him to the Legislature for the express
purpose of getting that asylum. If the
Monroe doctrine was a transportable chat
tel and required a board of directors and a
superintendent for its management his
constituents would insist upon his obtain
ing the doctrine, or, at least, a branch of
it, in Cactus County.
Then there is the man from Cow County.
His people want a normal school or a re
form school for incorrigible juveniles,
they don't care which.
The man from Roaring Slough would
like to be appointed State Librarian. He
believes that the appointment would be
an honor to the slough and that trade
would increase very materially in his dis
trict.
The man with a graft is everywhere.
He gets the new Senator in a corner and
pumps him full of eloquence like a pneu
matic Â«ire on a '97 bike. An easy victim
is the new Assemblyman who makes him
a half promise in order to get rid of him.
It is generally believed that $750,000 in
good bright gold is lying in the State's
vaults doing nobody any good, drawing
no interest and waiting for coyote scalps.
About $225,000 have been taken out of it for
coyote scalps, and as it will require several
months before the coyote ranches will be
ready to send in another supply of adult
scalps, more than half a million dollars
will lie idle. Therefore scores of legisla
tors have come prepared with ways and
means in the shape of bills to relieve the
treasury of the incubus. There is but very
little doubt that they will succeed in mak
ing the treasury as empty as the cave of
Molua.
Among the recent arrivals of legislators
is W. R. Guv, Republican Assemblyman
from San Diego. He was seen at the
Occidental last night and remarked that
his constituents did not want very much.
They wanted a State Normal School in
that county. A bill to that effect passed
both houses of the Legislature at the last
session, but it was pocketed by Governor
Budd. It will be reituroduced at this
session. Horticulturists of San D ego
want the Wright irrigation act so amended
as to be practically operative. While the
San Diegans are not shouting radically lor
retrenchment and reform they favor an
economical administration of affairs, and

of confirming and establishing land titles
anew and he reported favorably upon it.
Senator Thomas H. Goff, ex-Speaker
John C. Lynch and F. W. Richardson, all
of San Bernardino, are at the Baldwin.
Mr. Richardson is manager of the San
Bernardino Times-Index. They report
San Bernardino as not wanting much this
time â only an appropriation for the Whit
tier School, the State Normal School and
the Orphans' Home. Mr. Goff will intro
duce a bill allowing the boards of directors
of orphans' homes to keep half-orphans
under their control where the surviving
parent cannot support the child or is not
a fit person to have charge of the game.
The subject of good roads is one also
in which the people of San Bernardino are
very much interested.
The dairymen want the Legislature to
empower them to examine the books of
dealers with reference to the sale of oleo
margarine. They also want a law requir
ing cheese to be stamped, so that the pur
chaser may know whether it is made from
cream or "skim" milk.
Captain Goff's constituents are enthusi
astic on the subject of more protection to
sugar, the building of a new beet sug^ar
factory at Anaheim haying stimulated
them. An amendment is desired to tbe
Wright irrigation act, so that a man in
debted to the tii>trictfor taxes may sat

identified him as the man who pawned the
timepiece. Thompson, who is 34 years of age
and looks like a man without any visible
means of support, was booked for grand
larceny.
TRUTH.
It is sometimes good for a
man to know the truth about
things. Sometimes it is kinder
to tell him only half the truth
if you wish to save him unnec-
essary pain. But most men
know the state of their own
health if they will but admit
it to their own consciences.
The sensible man never tries to
fool himself where his life may
be involved. Just think for . a
moment. Do you have dizzy
spells ?; Do you have- a feeling
of bashfulness when you should
be bold ? Do you get cold,
clammy sweats ? Do you find
it hard to get refreshing and
sound- sleep ? Do you feel
gloomy and depressed when
you ought to ..be bright and
cheerful?. Nasty taste in your
mouth ? A dislike for work >or
for. exerting â¢ yourself in any
way ? And perhaps a weak
back ? My good man, don't
pass these symptoms by. Ask
yourself these questions in all
seriousness. Either one of them
indicates the approach of nerv-
ous exhaustion, and if you are
suffering in other ways it is
ABOUT
time for you to wake up, or your
condition will get worse and
worse until you will find your-
self and the organs of vitality
paralyzed and useless. Be wise
in; your day and generation.
You can be cured now, and
quickly, too, if you will but
try. You have friends that you
may not know of. Go to the
junction of Ellis, Stockton and
Market streets, and there you
will see a big white building.
It is the Hudson Medical Insti-
tute, and there you can learn all
about that wonderful remedio-
treatment "Hudyan." It is
the wonder of this age of mar-
vels. In 30 days it has cured
the most serious cases of blood-
poisoning ; it makes manhood ;
it disperses gloom ; it brings
light and life ; it cures varico-
cele and hydrocele ; it imparts
to the blood life's very essence ;
it has cured thousands and will
restore to you all your powers.
If you can't go to the Institute
write and ask for some of the
thousands of testimonials that
have; been given by grateful r
cured people and they will be
sent you free by mail at once.
You can be cured, and you will \
be cured, if you will but place
yourselt under the great
HUDYAN.

c 4 THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALLPOLK STREET UNLOCKED
BY ORDER OF THE KING
His Merry Fiesta Majesty Receives the Great Golden
Key and Declares the Carnival v
Opened.
The Thoroughfare Was Aflame
With Tints of Red and
Yellow.
SANTA CLAXJ3 IN THE TRAIN.
A Day of Splndid Colcr Display
F oats and Carriages in the
Parade.
The gates of Polk street, by order of the
king, were unlocked yesterday afternoon,
at one hour post meridian, and the world
swept through at t! c heels of his merry
majesty. There was the usual gorgeous
company that doth hedge about a king â
courtiers that always courted in the
dollar-a-line diction of a knightly are;
warriors bold, ever ready to lay lance at
rest and ticht for maid or fun; jesters,
whose jests had to be lifted with a derrick;
ladies lair, for whom flights errant fell
all over themselves in tlreir efforts to win
a smile; and dancers, soldiers, attendants,
policemen, etc., as is printed on play bills*
These trooped through the open post
and the gay carnival ran riot along the
red and yellow bannered through fare.
Polk street in everyday clothes is a sturdy
place, staying at home and attending
strictly to business; but in holiday colors
it is as brilliant as the solar spectrum.
And for its kingâ the royal master of the
fiestaâ it is meet that he be given special
Bpace in these annals.
Before he was offered a crown, which re
port saith he a dozen times put away and
accepted, at the thirteenth .offer of the
kneeling, tearful "committee on kings"
from the I'olk Street Improvement Club,
the kin? was Joe P. Frenna, the jolly bar
ber of 12015-i Polk street. Ha is an intense
republican in spite nf his monarchical job,
and only took the throne on condition
that the nihilists of rival streets refrain
from bomb practice during his two days'
reign. They gave bonds to that effect, and
King Joe rode into the carnival yesterday
as proud and noble in ' his bearing a*
Charlemagne. When the fiesta is over he
will iay his sceptre away in its red acd
yellow cerements and be all the bettei
commoner from leaving been for a period
a king. .
Another royal character of the triumphal
entry into Polk street was Santa Ciaus,
the chapsain of the courtly train. Before
taking orders he was George Roberts, the
candy man of Bush and Polk streets.
Seated 0.1 a donkey of diminutive stature
and lowly aiein he scattered with prodi
pal hands sugared gifts to the small boy
populace. . .
Following the splendid retinue of the
monarch, cad in their royal medieval
regimentals, came the civilian officers oi
the fiesta committee, clothed in the lea;
rroposmg garments of -a later century.
among whom were Fred Curtis?,' Louis
Hinman, Colonel Will :E. Fisher, George
P. Roberts, L. H. Kohn : and Max Levin.
Carriages containing several dancing girls
and masked players came then,' and a foot
company of fantastically appareled jesters
brought up the rear.' -s
When: the; merry monarch of the car
nival in state approached the southern
pate of the street he was met by Master
of Ceremonies Hinmau- and addressed in
the following words:, .. Â.....!
"Your : Majesty, f I have â â¦ been' ; deputed
Scene on the Gayly Decorated Thoroughfare Looking South From California Street.
by yonr loyal subjects on Polk street to
present you with this key of the same,
and to bez you to aid us ia celebrating
this fiesta. We wish you a long, prosper
ous and happy reign."
The king ordered the magnificently en
graved invitation pasted, to tue royal
scrspbooK, and gravely replied :
"My loyal subjects, I am greatly pleased
with the emblem of allegiance which you
have seen fit to deliver to me. I wish you
ail a happy future, and I hereby declare
this liestd'open."
Toe committee salaamed their gratitude
upon finding themselves solid with his
royal nibs, and with the great golden key
opened the carnival. Then heraldic
i trumpets welcomed the sovereign witn
sonorous sounds, and ihe cavalcade swept
up the street under the great red banner
with its motto/'PoiK Street and Progress,"
; and under the thous3ndsof iittle bi-<colored
j flags waving a royal welcom.2 to the king.
But few floatsiappeared in the afternoon
parpde, but tiiose thrft did display were
j remarkable for their grotesquene?s. The
I afternoon procession was simply a pre
| lirninary affair, but it succeeded in draw
ing a large crowd to the scene of the fiesta.
The small boy was much in evidence,
and fully ns enthusiastic as any of the
property-owners or merchants. He not
only did as much as he could to make
noise ia a tin-horn- *"ay, but he add?d to
the length ana breaatu of the procession.
There was one ragged little urchin who
was the possessor of a miniature float that
) for artistic decorating was superior to any
in the parade. It was a boys' express

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1896.
wagon, completely smothered in ever
greens, and there in the wagon sat the
boy himself, the only part of him visible
Deing his fresh little face peeping through
an evergreen that swung gracefully on the
front of the wagon.
The parade was headed by eight mount
ed policemen under command of Cor
poral Shanaban. They were followed by
a military bras? band of ten pieces, and
then came :he King on horseback wearing
a gorgeous cape of many and royal colors,
prominent among which were the red and
yellow of the carnival. The caoe was
bordered with hands of ermine, and his
red trousers were almost concealed by the
length of yellow-tan boot.
His kinely Gainsborough of red felt was
topped off with plumes of rainbow hues.
He was attended by twelve mounted
courtiers badged find beribboned in the
carnival tints and wearing steel helmet?.
Tne Kina's trumpeter was radiant in a
sils suit of Lincoln green bespangled with
silver. Tnen came the carriages contain
ing the members of the fiesta committee
and dancers and morrv-makers followed,
and then appeared Mr. Kaufman in a
decforau-d float of the Cobleigh Carriage
Company, iii which there was a forge in
full blast with an anvil chorus played by
a small colored yonth. Sutro bath's band
brought up the rear of the parade, followed
by Santa Claus seated on a donkey. He
rode up and down distributing tiny cornu
copias of candy.
Very pretty was the electric-Illuminated
Polk street last night, and though tr^e rain
had melted the red and yellow out of
many of the banners the colors, especially
those over the lighted windows, shone
with a pleasine effect. The sidewalks
were crowded with people, but the kin?
came not. He had evidently abdicated
for the night, refusing to reisn in con
junction with the clouds that lowered
darkly overhead. However, the nieht
parade was put off till this afternoon and
to-nighi. when if the weather permits Polk
street will be in her glory.
StcreÂ»ary Fred Curtiss of the fiesta
committee, speaking of the carnival last
night, said that notwithstanding the un
favorable weather they were ID a measure
pleased witn, the success of the carnival,
even at the beginning of the festivities.
"Many people," said he, "who never
heard of Polk 6treet except in a eeneral
way have read of the work of our club,
which is the leader of street improvement
in this City, and have visited us to-day
and noted this maniiestation of our en
terprise.
"The ciub and especially the fiesta com
mittee have worked industriously for this,
raising upward of $1000 for the carnival.
That is a good sum for hard times. If it
had not rained to-night thousands of
Japanese lanterns would have been strung
along the street, making a grand display.
However, to-morrow afternoon we will all
be out in carnival array and the evening
will ses a spectacle of splendor.
"The fireworks will be the event of the
occasion and the rain can hardly Interfere
with that Toward the end there will be
a huge set piece of pyrotechnic illustration,
representing the going of toe old year, a
decrerjit 1896. and the arrival of a vigor
ous young '97. This scene at the stroke of
midnight will be fired and the display will
finish with tbo flaming salutation, 'A
Happy New Year to You.' The fiesta will
end with a ball at Assembly Hall and
will be under the direction ci Professor
Hinman."
The following stores were neatiy deco
rated. Some had a lavish display, while
others were content with a lesser showing,
but all had shown their approbation and
enthusiasm of the fiesta:
Bibo, Newman <fc Ikenberg, grocers, had the
windows an 1 the front of their large store
brilliantly decorated.
The confectionery establishment of Charles
F. Stocking, 1825 Polk street, was one of the
prettiest decorated places in the line of build
ing?. With rare taste the carnival tints had
been interwoven across the large windows,
and inside the colors were arranged with the
same ca.-e.
Franit I>. Worth, upholsterer and draper,
had the fr^nt of nis store draped with a nnm
bc-r of small American flags, carnival colors
ar.d Japanese lanterns.
C. L. Gutter's saloon had an elaborate display
of carnival colors with a humorous cartoon of
a landlord with an ax raised abov<- his bead,
signifying a cut Id rent.

VETERANS COME TOGETHER
High Honors for Colonel Hla.-kbur;: at
a Meeting of the Army and Navy
Republican League.
A pleasant reunion of the members of
Leland Stanford Camp, Arrn3' and Navy
Leaeue, was held in Social Hall, Foresters'
building, 102 O'Farrell street, hist even
ing.
At the opening of the meeting Adjutant
R. T. llelvin rose and made a few remarks
highly eulogistic of M. S. .Blackburn,
coionel commander of the camp, after
wnich he introduced a resolution in sub
stance as follows:
That M. S. Blackburn has for the lsst twenty
years Dee n a true and consistent Republican;
as a soldier of trie last war was lound a true
friend of the old soldier; was instrumental in
organizing the Loys in blue in tne year 1871);
was, during the las tCisipn'gn. elected colonel
commander of Lincoln Camp No. 2 of the
Army and N&vy Republican League, and a^
such ha* done more to keep alive a spirit ot
patriotism and unity of action among the old
soldier 3 and sailors and their sons of the Re
publican party than any other man in this
City; and that, unaided financially, he has
furnished the expenses during this campaign
of some twelve enthusiastic meetings.
Tnat, therefore, the members of Leland
Stanford Camp, Army and Navy Republican
Lesgue, most heartily indorse him for the posi
tion of fension Agent for this department,
aod a copy of these resMutions will bo for
warded to the Legislature at Sacramento, re
questing our Assemblymen to nse their in
fluence to secure his appointment to that posi
tion.
With loud applause the resolution waÂ»
carried unanimously by a standing vote.
An interesting programme of music and
recitations was then carried out. Pro
fessor McKenzie's quartet, especially, was
eiven a vote of thanks at the close. The
performers were all encored, and the
"Daughter of the Regiment," Miss Dora
Johnson, in her dance, "La Poloma,"
arousod keen appreciation.

THE CLOSING YEAR.
The year which closes to-day has been
in the ihain a prosperous one for Califor
nia, even if it cannot be so accounted for
the Nation at large. In this State our
realizations have been greater than our
disappointments. We are not only better
off in a material sense, but we are more
hopeful at the close than we were at the
beginning of the year.
The most notable accomplishment in the
State during the past twelve months has
been the opening of tiie Valley Railway
from Stockton to Fresno under conditions
which assure the speedy extension of the
line to Bakersfield and to this City. Claus
Spreckels, to whose energy, financial
strength and public spirit we owe what
has been achieved in the promotion of the
road, is still urging the work forward, and
the new year will see tbe fulfillment of the
promise of the old.
The late frosts of the spring injured the
crops of the State to some extent, but the
loss seems to have been more than coun
terbalanced Dy the increase in prices over
those of last year. Vineyards, orchards
and farms nave rewarded with fair profits
the industry of those who tilled them and
throughout the rural districts an air of
prosperity prevails, which seems bright in
comparison with the depression of past
seasons.
In all the csties and towns of the State
there have been evidences of renewed ac
tivity in trade and industry, and in not
a few of them there have been notable ad
vances in municipal improvements and
enterprises. In this respect the closing
weeks of the year have been remarkable
in San Francisco. The movement for
better street liehting has been carried for
ward with a degree of rapidity and by an
extent of co-operation which has sur
prised even the most sanguine.
The Presidential election, which was the
Rteat National event of the year, enned In
beneficial results whose magnitude cannot
yet be calculated. All the long seething
discontents of the people, all sectional
isms, all class prejudices, all passions ex
cited by agitators, all follies engendered
by mistaken conceptions of politics, hav
ing been brought together in one mass,
were effectually crushed out by the
patriotism, the honesty and the sturdy
common-sense of the majority of Ameri
can voter--. The political atmosphere is
therefore clearer than it has been in a long
time and public welfare, as far as it can
be affected by legislation, is well assured.
Even our relations with foreign coun
tries are in better condition than they
were at the beginning of the year. If
much has been left undone in regard to
Cuba enough was done in the Venezuelan
affair to impress upon Eun>pe the fact
that the United States must always be
consulted in every controversy affecting
the territorial integrity of any country of
the American hemisphere.
Taking all thines into consideration the
year has been prosperous at least for Cali
fornia and honorable for the Nation a3 a
whole. Sufficient has been done to give us
reasous for hoping for better things to
come. We have confirmed the faith of the
world in our industrial and political secur
ity. We have laid troad and deep the
foundations of future building and to that
we can address ourselves with confidence
in the j'ear which beeins to-morrow.
A NEE DED WORK.
The meeting df the swamp-land owners
at Sacramento for the purpose of cons der
ing the best methods of clearing the chan
nels of the rivers of the State brings to the
front one oi the most important of the
great public improvements with which
California will be called upon to deal.
The river mainly affected is the Sacra
mento, and so vast will be the amount of
energy and money required to deepen it 3
channels and reclaim its swamps that it
will be well to give the subject the fullest
possib.e consideration before entering
upon the enterprise.
The gain to the State from the improved
commercial facilities resulting from deei
ening the channel of the river and the
added wealth resulting from a reclama
tion of the swamp lands would undoubt
edly mo r e than repay the cost of making
the improvements. If, therefore, thore
were no other considerations to be taken
into account the proposed work would be
cordially supported by the people. It
happens, however, that there are many
other factors which affect the problem,
and these will htove the effect of making
even the most public-spirited Californians
hesitate before entering upon an under
taking of such magnitude.
The convention at Sacramento adopted
a memorial to the Governor ana the Legis
lature giving indorsement to the plan of
river improvement recommended by the
Commissioner of Public Works, which in
many respects offers a solution of some of
the difficulties of the problem. '.The
memorial states:
The most pressing necessity at the present
time is tne im:rovement of the Sacramento
River, between Fremont and the moutn of the
Sacramento River, half a mile below Coilins
ville, which can be done in accordance with
the views expressed by the Commissioner of
Public Works, by means of a dredger, in re
moving the shoals at Newton and the con
struction of a restraining wall from the foot of
Grand Island to Wood Island, about a distance*
of two and a half miles, which work, in accord
ance with the report of the H6n. Edward E.
Leafce, Commissioner of Public Works of this
State, can be accomplished.
For the purpose of carrying on thiswoik
the convention will ask from the Legisla
ture an appropriation, to be expended by
the Commissioner. It is the beliÂ»f of the
promoters of the enterprise that if the
State begins the task of improvement it
will be possible to procure aid from the
General Government. This belief is cer
tainly founded upon good reason. The
National Government has given liberal
appropriations for the construction of a
canal which is to give Chicaco water com
munication with the Mississippi, and cer
tainly the work of improving the Sacra
mento is eqaally deserving of Federal
support. â¢'â¢ "-' "
FOREOLOSE THE LIEN.
The reports made at the meeting of the
Committee of Fifty on Tuesday, and the
proceedings taken at the time, show that
active work is being done by the commit
tee to guard the interests of California
against the proposed funding of the debts
of the Pacific railroads. This work, taken
in connection with reports from Washing
ton of the growing sentiment in opposi
tion to the bili, gives renewed encourage
ment for the hope of the ultimate success
of the people in defeating the measure.
The most notable work recently accom
plished by the committee has been the
preparation of a memorial to Congress
giving a history of the dealings ot the
Central Pacific roads with the Govern
ment, and showing thereDy how futile it
would be for Congress to trust the com
pany uny further after it had so com
pletely defaulted in every obligation in
the past.
The memorial, which is a very long one,
will serve to make clear to members of
Congress the nature of the men with
whom they have to deal in this issue.
While much of the story does not affect
directly the problem of the expediency of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1896.
the funding bill, it will nevertheless serve
a good purpose by setting Congressmen
on their guard against any eloquent
promises which the railroad may make,
and the complicated statements of ac
count which it may submit as arguments
why it would be expedient for the Gov
ernment to fund the debt rather than to
foreclose the mortgage.
As the memorial states, "To extend the
payment or refund this debt as proposed
is practically to sell the road to its pres
ent management on a credit of 100 years,
taking a promise to pay in small install
ments.'' Moreover, as the memorialists
point out, Congress does not, nor does any
of its members or any executive officer of
the United States, know what the prop
erly really consists of. No inventory of it
has been taken, and so long as it remains
in the hands of the present unscrupulous
managers and skillful bookkeepers, it will
be impossible to obtain any accurate in
formation on the subject.
The memorial accurately sums up the
desires of the people on the subject by say
ing:
We believe that all the desired ends can ba
obtained by means of a foreclosure of the
Government lien on the road. For this pur
pose, as tae properly lies in several different
States, complete jurisdiction should be con
ferred on some one of the courts of the United
States nnd the ordinary powers of the court
enlarged so as to enable it to ascertain and re
dress in the foreclosure suit all frauds prac
ticed on the company or its shareholders by
the management or by their tools or confed
erates, and the application of any moneys re
covered from such parties to the sinking fund
in the United States treasury. We therefore
respectfully pray Congress to instruct its ap
propriate committees te prepare and report a
bill to that effect.
This undoubtedly reoresents the senti
ment of the great majority of the people
of California on the subject. Experience
has taught that no reliance can be placed
upon any pledges or promises which the
Central Pacific Company may make in re
gard to fulfilling its obligations. It has
not hesitated to violate them iv the past,
nor will it hesitate to ignore them in the
future. The issue is a simple one:
Whether tne Government shall enforce
its laws against defaulters or permit them
to go free. There would be no question or
controversy over such an issue if the de
faulter were a citizen of ordinary means,
and there should be none in this case
where the defaulter is a powerful corpora
tion aiming to enrich itself by defrauding
the Government and plundering the
people.
DEMANDING PROTECTION.
The representatives of American in
dustry who are now being heard by the
Committee of Ways and Means at Wash
ington are giving abundant evidence of
the need of increased protection to pro
mote tne welfare of American industry.
Such evidence, after the disastrous expe
riences of the last three years, is hardly
necessary lo^bonvince any intelligent man
.of the importance of that need, but it is
nevertheless valuable, as it coes to show
in detail how great has been the injury
inflicted by the Democratic* tariff upon
each particular industry of the people.
It is notable that in almost every case
the men who have been heard before the
committee have strongly recommended
the adoption of specific instead of hd
valorem duties. As was well said by one
of the representatives of the cotton cloth
manufacturers on Tuesday, "Ad valorem
duties catch nothing in the custom
house." They afford no protection what
ever to industry and almost no revenue to
the Government. About the only things
which they produce to any extent are
false entries and perjuries.
An interesting fact brought out by the
investigation is that manufacturers in
England arc much more lightly taxed
than in the United States. Mr. Chase of
Fall River, Mass., stated that his mill
raid $24,000 in taxes, while a similar mill
in England would pay but $3000. In
Great Britain everything is done to stimu
late manufacturers, while in this country
the manufacturer not only has to pay
higher wages than in England, but higher
taxes also.
One of the most satisfactory features of
the hearings has been the appearance of
representatives of Southern industries be
fore the committee joining as earnestly as
their Northern friends in advocating a re
turn to the protective system. One of
these made a strong argument in favor of
the adoption of a high duty on Egyptian
cotton. This product, it seems, is at pres
ent underselling the extra staple cotton of
the Southern States, having largely de
creased in price during the last ten year. j .
The appearance of these Southern men
asking for protection is not pleasing to the
free-trade Democrats who represent the
South in Congress. One of them, General
Wheeler of Alabama, is reported to have
declared with much warmth, "The South
will be selling its birthright for a mess of
pottage to ask for this protection."
When questioned as to what the Southern
birthright was Mr. Wheeler replied, "Free
institutions, free trade and free every
thing." This is indeed a pretty senti
ment, but it does not help the industries
of the South, and the men who are now
engaged in building them up have learned
that freedom for American industry to
grow and prosper is a great deal better
than free trade and industrial demoraliza
tion.
While but few of the hearings proposed
have been held as yet, enough has been
made known to make certain that it will
be comparatively easy for the committee
to agree upon a bill which will find sup
port by the ereat majority of the people
In every section of the Union. The de
mand everywhere is for protection, and in
providing that the next Congress will re
move this long-vexed question from our
politics and prepare the way for going for
ward to other things.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS,
The Nordtca concerts at the Baldwin Thea
ter promise to be even more attractive than
wrs at first supposed. According to telegrams
received yesterday the company will consist,
in addition to Nordica, of Scolchi, whose voice
is said to have lost none ot its remarkable
power and depth; Bertbold, a well-known
tenor, and Dempsey, a bass who is popular in
the East. It is intended to give costume acts
from various operas, nnd the hope is held out
that these works will be some of the best in
the modern repertory. The only opera which
has been mentioned by wire as being certain
to be represented is Wagner's "Siegfried."
The singers will be accompanied by a large
orchestra, and although negotiations are not
yet fully completed with a conductor it Is
more than probable that a man well known in
connection with operatic productions will
wield the baton. The first concert takes
place Tuesday, January 19, the second on
Thursday, the 21st, and the third will be a
SCALCHI, the Famous Contralto, Who Will Be Heard at the
Baldwin Theater Next Month.
Saturday matinee. After the collapse of the
Mapleso* company all hopes of grand opera
in San Francisco were abandoned for this sea
son, so it will be a great satisfaction to opera
lovers to find that something very nearly ap
proaching grand opera is to be given after all.
The War Department of Austria-Hungary ha 3
just addressed a rather curious circular to the
generals of the army. It is a well-known fact
that in Austria the military bands, which are
numerous ana for the most part excellent,
play In the places of amusement, restaurants,
cafes, etc., to the no small detriment of the
civilian bands. The remuneration the sol
diers receive for this work is the chief source
of revenue of the military bands. To add at
tractiveness to their programmes the military
bandmasters have lately taken to playing
pieces where several musicians whistle with
the orchestra. Needless to say, in so musical a
country as Austria, the melodies whistled or
sung by the soldiers were speedily taken up
and sung by the bystanders in restaurants of
the cheeper kind, and the rendering of a pop
ular air was the signal for a ceneral and very
noisy musical demonstration. The War De
partment has been very much worried over
this state of things, and the circular above al
luded to prohibits the members of military
bands from either whistling or singing, except
incidentally, and an entire air is never to be
whistled. Iv the popular waltz, for Instance,
"Weiner Madel'n," the principal melody has
to be first whistled and then taken up in cho
rus. This waltz is henceforth on the black
list, and the Viennese will never again hear It
performed by their favorite military bands.
On the other hand, the popular song "'Den
Weanea Schan'," which only contains one
brief whistle at the commencement, is still
permissible. It is easy to see that the distinc
tion is very casuistical between prohibited
music and that which is still allowable.
Henceforth an expert will pass judgment on
all pieces that contain whistling or singing
before the Austrian military bands are al
lowed to render them.
One of the leading Berlin critics has just
made a record for himself by refusing abso
lutely to report any concerts except those
which deserve signalizing to the public on ac
count of their artistic excellence, and his
proposition has been received with enthusi
asm in the concert-ridden capital of Germany,
where sometimes as many as nine concerts
are given in one day. This critic evidently
thinks that there is very little but notoriety
to be obtained by concert giving in Berlin, for
he says: "If my fellow critics would follow
my example artists would think twice before
foolishly spending their money without ob
taining even the satisfaction of eeeing their
names printed In the papers In return."
"Andrea Chenier," poor Mapleson's one
operatic novelty, could not save the veteran
impressario from bankruptcy In the East, but
in Europe it seems to be doing a pretty brisk
business, for it is annouced simultaneously
for the following countries and towns: Aus
tria and Germany, at Budapest, Prague,
Trieste, Hamburg, Frankfort and Breslau;
Russia, at St. Petersburg and Moscow; Italy,
at Rome, Naples, Turin, Parma, Mantua, Bres
cia, Palermo, etc., and Portugal at Lisbon.
Not a ba f l beginning for the first season of a
new composer's first opera. Indeed, the suc
cess of Giordano's opera Is sucli that it has
revived an interest in the unfortunate poet,
whose sad story forms i;s p'.ot, and the fad is
to read Andrea Chenier's poems and attend
lec'.ures on him.
Salnt-Saens' new ballet d'actlon, "Javotte,"
has been most enthusiastically received at the
Grand Theater of Lyons. The score is said to
be full of charm and vivacity, and the story,
although simple, is effective. Javotte Is a
young peasant who is so passionately fond of
dancing tbatshe escapes tnrough a window to
attend the village danco her parents have for
bidden her to see. There she meets a lover,
and in a competition for the best dancer he
wins the prize, that of being allowed to select
a bride. Ho chooses Javotte, and in the end
wins her parents' consent to the wedding,
which closes the story of the ballet.
Some of the Eastern papers are making hot
warfare against the foreign artists, who seem
to have things their own way at the Metro
politan Opera-house. In the meantime the
French capers are circulating the report that
these same artists had such rough weather on
tne voyage over that they cursed America and
its dollars and regretted sweet France, "whose
only storms are electoral storms."
Nicolas Barilil, half-brother of Adellna Patti,
on the mother's side, died receutly In New
York. The mother of the celebrated singer
had for her first husband the son of a cele
brated singer, Mme. Barilli, and by the first
marriage oi Patti's mother there were two
sons. The eldest, Antonio, became a clever
conductor, and wus also known as a composer ;
he died at Naples in 1876. The second son,
Nicolas Barilli. remaim-d obscure all his life.

A dispatch announces that a new opera
entitled "Armida c Rinaldo" has met with
great success in Italy. The work is by Auui
bale Pallizone, but the dispatch does not state
whether the libretto has any connection with
Handel's opera on the subject of Armida and
Kinaldo. Handel's once popular work, about
which Addison wrote so much, Is almost for
gotten to-day, but one aria from it still sur
vives, "Lascia ch'io piange." It is frequently
sung In churches to sacred words.
A rather singular piece of news is going the
round ol the German musical papers. These
journals assert that the directors of the Royal
Opera of Berlin have requested Verdi to make
some modifications in the score of his opera
"Luisa Miller," and that the famous composer
has replied by a short and decided refusal,
alleging, with some reason, that the long and
prosperous career of the opera shows him that
no corrections are necessary.
The theater of Helsingfdrs has just produced
with success the first opera written by a
Finnish composer. The work is entitled "Tor-

and it is based on an old Finnish legend.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
Miss Loie Fuller, the celebrated dnnseusp, is
strong on the t-UDject of health. Speaking of
one aspect of tne matter yesterday she said:
"It is doubtful if one out of a thousand
knows, or one out of a hundred ever thinks
what it means to breathe only through the
mouth.
"This Is matter of far greater importance
than is generally supposed. Our forefathers,
the Indians, knew how to teach their children
from the beginning to breathe only through
LOIE FULLEK.
[From her latest photograph.]
the nose by placing them in a proper position
when asleep. Should the motner by chance
find her pappoose sleeping with its mouth
open she would know that its head was thrown
too far back, and she also knew that by mov
ing Us head a little forward and gently pinch
ing its lips with her fingers the child would
soon involuntarily keep its right position and
month closed at the same time. It seems in
credible that our so-called Indian mothers
should 'think' more than our mothers of to
day. For after all do we not all know it is
through lying od the back with head improp
erly placed that snoring is caused ? And when
the position ot the sleeper is changed and he
is made to lie on the side with the head a lit
tle forward the mouth is closed, the nose per
forms its proper function, and there are no
more snores heard and no more complaints of
dreams or nightmares.
"Quiet and restful repose at night is indis
pensable after a fatiguelng day, but it is un
reasonable to oxpect this when nature's prop
erties are perverted and the object for which
the nostrils are bestowed totally ignored. W e
should all clearly understand that the atmos
phere is not pure enough for man's breathing
until it has been filtered and tempered by the
nasal passages. The nose is to the lungs what
the mouth and palate are to the stomach, and
the air which passes through the nostrils is
just as different from 'mouth-breath' as pond
or cistern water differs from distilled.
"No one will approve of swallowing fish
bones, nut shells or glass, because they kuow
tnerewillbe an immediate bad result; yet,
simply because the result from mouth breath
ing is a slower process, they will allow them
selves for hours together to Inhale foul, fetid
air through the mouth, unmindful of its im
purities and disease germs. It is simply be
cause they do not know what a wise provi
dence it would be if it could have been born
within us to know these things ourselves and
to teach them to our children. The first les
sons we should be tauget in public schools, or
in any others, should be these natural results
and naturitl causes. By ill-using, misusing
and non-using our nostrils as we do they be
come useless, just like an old roadbed that has
been allowed to grow up through non-use,
a nd therein breeds catarrh, polypus, cancers
and other horrible diseases of the nose; and
yet, properly used, the nostril is expressly
adapted to arrest or purify such impurities
and germs.
"Could we examine the lungs of those who
live in smoky towns we would find them coated
and impregnated with soot and organic arti
cles of all kinds. Is it a wonder then that
bronchitis, croup and asthma follow such an
abused state? You know our noses could not
have been given to us simply lor the sake of
looks, becuuse nothing in nature is given us
for that alone. Our noses are organized to
modify and select the needful quantity oi air.
Do we not all know that we may breathe for
some time and live in a most poisonous atmos
phere at the bottom of a well by breathing
through the nose, whereas, If the mouth were
used, the lungs would immediately close and
asphyxiation would result.
"I am sure all firemen will tell you that they
always close the mouth when entering a burn
ing building. Then can it not De that these
extreme moments and occasions should direct
us in our everyday life when the result is only
prolonged and the effect more Insidious?
"If every time we wake at night we would
impress it upon ourselves to sleep with the
mouth closed it would not be long until we
would be surprised at the result obtained.
Another thing: Fancy, if you can, where peo
ple have no ventilation and how unwhole
some is the carbonic acid gas thrown off from
the lungs, it is not a wonder that they rise in
the morning with the throat parched, the
mouth dry and the rest has been incomplete,
and all through the result of mouth-breathing.
"Now, one of the most important results of
mouth breathing is the receding gum and the
dropping teeth. If the moutli in closed during
sleep a secretion of saliva takes place which
floods and cleanses the teeth and gums, aiding
to maintain them in a healthy and unim
paired condition, but when the air is taken
directly into the mouth the mucous membrane
Boon becomes dry, the flow of saliva is stopped
and gums and teeth suffer deterioration, for
the oxygen in the air while it maintains us is
also the great destroyer of all things. It is
the' oxygen in the atmosphere that destroys
stone, then why should it not affect the teeth?
"Another important point is to keep the
tongue as much as possible from pressing
against the teeth, especially any one tooth (as
nervous people are in the habit of doing).
Biting the finger nails will also alter the po
sition of the teeth, and toothpicks will loosen
the gums; they are baneful and should never
be used. If the teeth and gums are well looked
after by a good dentist occasionally and hept
In proper condition a toothpick would never
be found necessary.
"Your readers who have a tooth that has
gradually grown slightly longer than the
others may arrest the dropping of that tooth
by breathing through the nose Instead of the
mouth. In addition to this a stiff tooth brush
and salt and water, brushing the gums vigor
ously, will aid the stoppage of the tooth and
the receding gums.
"One word more regarding the nose. To those
who have already reached the stage where it is
impossible to breath excepting through the
mouth it will be found that persisting long,
slow nostril breathing will eventually be re
warded by the passages becomfnsr free, except
in extreme cases, when a surgeon or physician
should be consulted at once.
"A child's teeth will never fail to grow
crooked if that child is allowed to breatJie
through its mouth, and they will never fail to
grow straight if it is taught to breathe through
its nose.
"Aiter all this is it necessary to further im-
press upon you the necessity of breathing
through your nose?
" 'Shut your mouth and save your life.' "

CRUSHED BY THE
CHESTER'S BONES
A Broken Telegraph Cable
Tells of the Vessel's
Shifting Grave.
Supposed to Be in a Straight
Line Between Fort and
Lime Points.
A Daughter Born to the Captain cf
the Casablanca During the
Voyage Here.
The wreck of the City of Chester has
been located. At least that is the asser
tion of the men on the cable-laying scow j
owned by Captain Freese. They are posi- j
tive that the machinery and all the iron
parts of the hull will be found in a direct
line between Fort Point and Lime Point.
Tne .ground Xor their theory is this.
Some months ago tht* telegraphic and
telephonic cable between Fort Point and
Lime Point wore out. A second cable was
laid, and it also wore out. A third was |
recently laid, and the work of rescuing j
the regains of :he other two were begun, j
It took all the strength of a powerful
wrecker to get one end of the cable ashore,
and when it was examined it proved to be J
rusted clear through. The other end,
when it was recovered, proved to be in a
similar condition. Nothing but iron or j
steel resting on the cable for an indefinite
period could rust out the wire, and the
general supposition is that the iron and
steel in the engine-room of the City of
Chester when she went down have been
carried by the current on the Govern
ment cables and there held. Mr. Freese's
cabie scow will be towed out by the
Spreckels tug Ale.t this morning, and the
chances are that one end of tbe other rust- j
eaten cable will be on board the wrecker
this afternoon.
Everybody will remember the occasion
on which the City of Chester and the
Oceanic were in collision in the bay years
ago. The Chester went down and many
lives were lost Lawsuits followed and !
the exact location of the point of collision
became an important matter in the cases.
The evidence of the cables may therefore
be of much importance, although it might
be that the tides have shifted the sunken
hulk. Captain Whitelaw swears she is
resting inside Lime Point, and he once j
took a jury out and caught something
with his grappling hook that convinced
the jurors tuat the Chester was really
there.
Captain Cantley of tbe British ship ;
Casablanca was a happy man when he Â«ot j
his ship into port Tuesday night. During i
the voyage his wife gave birth to a female !

hurricane, but the winds favored the
mother and little Casablanca came into
the world when it was almost a dead calm
and the ship was not moving a Knot au
hour.
The Merchants' Exchange contradicts
the report about the sighting of an over
turned vessel by the captain of the Invin
cible. The skipper says that all he saw
was a moving mass which might have
been anything. Captain Bottler of the
schooner Lily, from Umpqua, says he
passed close to a dead whale which, owing
to its age, bad turned lead color and
looked like the bottom of a vessel. As he .
passed it the seagulls were making a j
meal off the carcass.
Tbe Lily also reports passing the gaso
line schooner Checto. The latter has been
considered overdue, but Captain Bc-ttger
says she had run out of gasoline a;;d was
making l er way under sail to San Fran
cisco.
"Admiral" Boettge of the New Califor
nia House on East street, Andrew Ander

tion works, but a derrick was required.
He purchased a big pile, and, with nis as- }
sistants, started in a sailboat to take it to
Harbor Vi?w. All went well until the
tide rip off Lombard-street wharf struck
the sailboat. Then the pile took com
mand. Pile and boat went crash into the
pier, and the boat lost her mast and the
boom was smasned in two. The men were
thrown overbour 1, but all escaped with a
duckinc. The admiral lost his oilskin
coat and rubber boots, but the damage to
the boat was his greatest sorrow. Event
ually the pile was towed to Harbor View,
but the crew had had ail they wanted of
the water, so tiey left the boat at anchor
and came back to the City by tbe caole- ;
cars.
The tug Fearless was sent out last night

The busiest man on the water front lat
terly has been D. Buchanan, the adjuster
of compasses. For weeks he has been at

der to be sure that everything was right.
He is now working on the compasses of

It was a good-natured party that left on

water front. The purpose of the trip* was !
to give members of the Legislature an ;
opportunity of becoming familiar with the
harbor. : â¢' '.â . â y>v- > -'^ -f'r 'â '. '^ : p â¢â '" ' : v '\ : '^ â¢
Tne party had gathered at the invita
tion of the . Harbor Commissioners, and
the responses were jso numerous -that it
was decided not to use the State tug "Gov- |
ernor Markham," ; it being too small to j
accommodate the crowd, and the Spreck- j
els tug was substituted.; :
On the excursion . were: Senators S. I
Braunhart, L. J. Dwyer, E. I. Wolfe, P. j
L. Henderson and J. Feeney of San Fran- |
Cisco, Senators Eli S. Denison, B. Strat- f
ton and J. D. Beard of Alameda, Senator

of San Mateo, W. R. Guy of San Diego, E. I
C. Damon of HumboJdt, F. D. Soward of
Sierra, W. M. Sims and S. F. S. Ennis of

. The non-members .'o!: ihe 'jegislature
were : Ex-Senator Tiry L. Ford, E. L.
Colnon, president of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners; Daniel 'Â£'. Cole
and F. S. Chadbourne, Harbor Commis
sioners Chief \ Engineer Holmes, .Paris
Kilburne,; Charles, P. Bassett, ex-piesi
dent of the Board of Harbor Commission
ers, James Giilis of Sacramento, and W.
B. Hamilton.
The necessary ; refreshments and the
usual preventives of seasickness were on
board and no casualties*- peculiar to land- i
lubbers were reported. The tug steamed
around Alcatraz and Angel islands, then
down 'past- Sauaalito and out to the |
Heads. On the return, beginning at (
about the Presidio, the tug hugged the
shore \ all the I way to the Union Iron
Works, taking in the entire water front.
On the return to the Mission-3treet pier
the tug kept close to the wharves and af
forded the legislators an excellent oppor
tunity for inspection. .:
The -party, disembarked at about 1
o'clock, much wiser than they had been
when they embarked.
Among the many things needed for the
improvement of this harbor, the necessity
for the speedy completion : of the seawall
from its present terminal at the ferry
slips southwesterly along the entire City
front was pointed out by ex-Senator Ford,
attorney for the Harbor Commissioners.
This work would improve shipping facili
ties greatly.
The Commissioners propose to ask the I
Legislature for permission to issue $1,000,
-000 or less of bonds to complete the sea
wall, the bonds and the interest thereon
to be paid out of the receipts from the
shipping and other harbor dues. :
There is also great need of ,a: bridge for
foot passengers from the; second * floor of
the new 5 Union depot across East street to
the foot of : Sacramento street, whero it
empties into Market street at the junction
of Last: All the streetcars pass 1 and â¢: re
pass 1 this ? point and r cars ;. and % loaded
wagons are . continually traveling in the
daytime along East street across this wide
stretch of ground, which passengers are
obliged to cross in eoing to or returning
from the ferries. No difference' of opinion
exists as to the necessity for the bridge,
but the obstacle in ; the â ' way :;i3" the J fact
that the Commissioners do not own the
ground on which the passengers would
land at the inner terminal of tue bridge,
although they have a valuable; strip of
property fronting on East* street in : the
same block. -<r. .'â  ; '": .â¢.â /.
Under the law of 'eminent domain: the
landing place j could be â  condemned and
purchased at an i appraised i valuation by
the Harbor Commissioners, but there is
no necessity to purchase land so long as
they have a large strip along East street,
a portion of. which could be exchanged for
the desired landing, which would proba
bly cost about $40,000. 7 - VI ; '
i; Some time '% before !v! v the : Commissioners
issued bonds for water front improvement
they oegan to lay aside a fund for the pay
ment of interest on the bonds, as such in
terest would fall due. About $43,000 had
been laid aside for this purpose 1 before the
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
bonds were sold, and as this sum will not
be required for the purpose for which it
was appropriated, the Commissioners will
ask the Legislature to allow them to
transfer it from the interest fund to the
general fund.
Some of the excursionists became sea
side near The Heads and a distressing ac
cident occurred. The roll of the sea was
so heavy that all the bottles rolled off the
cabin table, but only a few were broken
and the contents of what were rescued
prevented the total collapse of the guests.
Frank Coomb 3, ex-United States Minis
ter to Japan and Assemblyman-elect from
Napa County, was in town yesterday.
According to present indications Mr.
Coombs will be chosen Speaker of the next
Assembly without opposition. Spenkiug
yesterday of probable committee chair
manships, he saia that the only chairman
ship promised was that of the Judiciary
Committee. Judge Waymire of Alameda
will head that committee. Beyond this
nothing has been settled.
"My experien.ee," said Mr. Coombs;
"when I was Speaker before has taught
me the wisdom of making no selections
tor committee duty until the Legislature
meets. When I get to Sacramento, talk
with members and thus ascertain on what
committees they desire to serve I can
better judge what appointments sliould be

THE HUDELSON LIBEL.
Crosa-Examination of the Defendant

Attorney D. B. Woodworth, was continued

noon.
The entire afternoon was taken up with
questions regarding the proposition of
Woodworth to get $55,000 from John D.
Spreckela for a mine, the J tuige remarking
several times that ne failed to see what
object ccnld be gained by them.
There was a sharp interchange between
the witness and Woodworth, regarding a
monetary transaction in which Wood

STRING ON THE REWARD
Examiners Asked to Give to
Another the $1000 Claimed
by Lees.
Now Zibrewskei Asks the Board to
Audit His Cla m for Kov
alev's Arrest.
A document has been sent to Sacra
mento which may have more than a pass
ing interest for Captain Lees, chief of the
detective force. The purport of it is to
raise a contest before the State Board of
Examiners concerning the payment of
$1000, which has already been awarded to
Captain Lees by the Superior Court, but
which has not teen received. In fact a
hearing concerning this money is set
down in the Supreme Court for February
10, the case having been appealed, which
bears tie title of Lees against Colgan.
After the discovery of the murder of
Francis H. L. Weber and his wife at Sac
ramento, about December 9, 1894, Gov
ernor MarKham offered a reward of $1000
for the apprehension and conviction of ihe
murderer. Ivan Kovalev was arrested,
tried, found guilty and hanged for the
commission ot the crime. Captain Lees
claimed the reward. This is the $1000 in
question.
Attorneys Stanley Jackson and Joseph
C. Meyerstein, acting for Vladisiaw Za
brewskei, have just drawn up and for
warued to the State Board of Examiners,
getting in their work prior to the date set
lor the hearing in the Supreme Court ot
Lees against Colgan, a petition in which
various statements are made in support
of the claims of ZabrewsKei, and the board
is askerl to audit his claim for $1000 and
instruct the Controller to dr.iw a warrant
in favor of Zabrewskei for the amount.
The date of the petition is December 29,
1896.
Messrs. Jackson and Meyerstein set
forth that on June 20, 1895, Zabrewskei,
with the intention of clainiinn the reward
offered by Governor Markham, appre
hended Kovalev and delivered him to an
officer of the law in San Francisco; that
the delay in the presentation of this claim
is due entirely to Zabrewskei's reliance
upon those in authority at the police
headquarters in Sacramento and in San
Francisco, and that he was at a disad
vantage by being ignorant of the language
and customs of this country, he being a
Russian.
If this petition is not favorably acted
upon by the State Board of Examiners
there p.re other steps to be taken to secure
the $1000 for Zabrewsttei for which Captain
Lees was sued the Controller. Suit will be
entered at once and an effort will be made
to have the case tried in this City.
A hall of honor has been established in
the Val de Grace Hospital, Paris, where
the names of French medical men who
have died in the performance of their
dnty are inscribed on marble tablets.

LEVIN BROS,, RETAIL GROCERS,
HAVE FAILE D FOR $139,000
List of Liabilities and Estimate of Assets Placed
Before a Stormy Meeting of Numerous
Creditors.
Board o? Trade Appoints a Com
mittee of Merchants to
Investigate.
ASSETS ESTIMATED AT $110,000
Failure Ascribed to Dull Times, Com
petition and Slow Collections.
List of Chief Creditors.
Levin Bros., retail grocers, have failed.
The failure was announced yesterday, and
created quite a stir in commercial circles.
The liabilities of the firm, according to
the list presented to creditors yesterday
afternoon at the Board of Trade meeting,
amount to $139,000. The assets of the firm
were placed at $110,000. Creditors who
have had experience in realizing on assets
say that $55,000 may be realized. The
failure is ascribed to dull times, difficulty
in making collections and the dishonesty
of clerks.
Levin Bros, had five storesâ two in San
Francisco, two in Oakland and one in
Berkeley. The main store is at 1324 and
1326 Market street.
The meeting of creditors, called to order
at the Board of Trade rooms at 2 o'clock
yesterday, was one of tae largest and
etormiest ever held in San Francisco. A
member of a leading house on Front street
described the scene as a "mob of creditors."
He said: "I never saw such a long list of
creditors. It was something amusing as
well as startling. I thought when 1 saw
the list that the firm owed every concern
in California, from the Sonoma Pickle
Factory to the Imperial Cocktail Com
pany."
When the meeting was called to order
Jacob Levy of H. Levy & Co. was nomi
nated for chairman. He was chosen with
out delay. A well-known merchant who
was present said: "It was evidently a pre
concerted plan that Jake Levy should pre
side, for he had the committee names al
ready prepared. The programme was
smoothly carried out."
Isadora Levin made the statements for
the firm in trouble. He described the
difficulty of making collections, saying
that was the chief cause of the failure. He
also remarked that the dishonesty of
clerks was another cause. Hard times, he
taid, also tended to embarrass them.
Replying to questions as to the amount
of business which the firm had transacted.
Mr. Levy said that the main store and the
, branches did a business oi $250,000 a year.
: He made the announcement that the firm
had paid $30,000 to creditors between No
vember 23 and December 26 of this year.
Some- questions wero asked about the
lack of coin in the safe yesterday morning
when E. Martin & Co.'s attachment for
$300 was placed on the store. The ettorney
tor Levin Bros., Mr. Naptbaly, could not
give F. W. Van Sicklen the information
desired. Finally Isadore Levin was asked
about the coin, and be said that hearing
of the attachment he had put the com in
H. Levy & Co.'s safe. Some of the cred
itors were surprised that Jacob Levy, the
presiding officer of the meeting, who must
have known of the coin deposit, <iid not
promptly give tbe desired information.
After a cross fire, the questions lasting
for an hour or more, the creditors resolved
to place their interests in the hands of
'. the following committee, which was ap
pointed by the chairman of tbe meeting:
H. Levy& Co., C. E. Whitney & Co,
Anglo-California Bank, Getz Bros. & Co..
Haas Bros., Dalieniand & Co. and Samuel
Bros. & Co.
A proposition was made to the debtors
to transfer their assets to a committee of
three for the benefit of all the creditors,
the committee to make a complete inves
tigation and submit a report showing
what the debtors can do toward paying
their debts. It was acknowledged that
the debtors could not make a statement
at present as many accounts had to be ex
amined.
The principal creditors to Levin Bros,
are:
Anglo-Californlan Bank $35,000 OO
C. E. Whitney Â«fc Co 3,000 00

the note of Mrs. Levin, mother of the
Levin brother*, for $10,000.
A leading representative of one of the
oldest and wealthiest iirms on Market
street said, yesterday afternoon, that his
house had not sold goods to Levin Bros,
for a year. The manner in which the
Levins conducted business dia not invite
his continence.
The representative of a leading house
on Front street said his transactions with
the Levin Brothers were limited. He did
not desire their trade on a cash basis even,
because he knew as a matter of fact that
they were selling articles such as pickles,
preserves and jellies under wholesale
prices. Complaints had come from hon
orable merchants in this City and Oak
land that L?vin Brothers were selling
groceries for less than the articles cost in
the wholesale market, and as a result of
such competition those merchants who
were doing an honest and legitimate busi
npss lost their customers.
The two houses ot" the Levin Brothers
in San Francisco are located repectively
at 1324 Market street and 134 Sixth street.
There are two houses of the firm in Oak
land â one at Tenth and Washington
streets and* tbe other at 1734 Seventh
street. Recently a branch store was
established at Dwigbt Way station,
Berkeley.
The business was started in 1878 by
Isadore Levin. He began in a small way
on Turk stieet and carried on the business
alone until 1883, when Julius Levin was
! admitted. A few years later David Levin
was admitted to partnership There is a
large family of Levins in San Francisco.
The Levins of the grocery firm and the
Getzs of tbe firm of Getz Brothers & Co.
are related by marriage.
Two attachments were levied on the firm
yesterday. The Standard Soap Company
attached the Sixth-street store for $700
and W. Rigby laid an attachment on the
Market-street branch for $497.
The meeting of creditors yesterday was
prolonged until late in tbe afternoon.
Secretary Smith of the Board of Trade
was not in position to state definitely how
serious the failure was and neither could
h9 give an estimate of the amount of
money that may be realized from the
ass?ts. He thought that each store of the
firm would be placed in the hands of a
representative of the Board of Trade and
then an accurate inventory of the goods
on hand and an examination of the ac
counts of the firm would be at once made.
It was incidentally stated at the meeting
of creditors that the dishonesty of cierks
contributed to tne embarrassment of the
nrm, but no names or amounts were men
tioned.
Some of tbo creditors have resoived not
to settle for a ceni less than one hundred
cents on the dollar. A Front-street mer
chant said last evening: "1 am suspic
ious of these large amounts which the
Levin Brothers represent that they owe
to certain firms. It is easy enough to say
that they owe to a certain house $15,000
when the actual indebtedness mfly not
excetjd JSOOO. Aeain, I>vin said be paid
to creditors between November 23 and
December 26, $30,000. He did not produce
vouchers to verify this statement, but said
tbe checks could tie produced. The pro
duction of these checks may have some
bearing on the final settlement."
After the S'-jion of the Board cf Trade
the creditors went to ttieir rospective
places of business. The expressions con
cerning the firm were not friendly, and a
determination was expressed to have a
' most thorough and searching investiga
| tion matie.
The brothers Levin themselves a c sert
that the competition put up by the Em
porium, Lebenbaum and others, has de
moralized the retail grocery business.
In order to meet that competition extra
ordinary efforts to sell goods at the small
est margin of profit had to be empioyed.
D. Levin, who is the outside manager of
the market street house (Isadore being the
office and financial man) said yesterday
that he did not know what steps the credi
tor* would take.
He expressed confidence in the ability of
the firm to weather the storm, if the cred
itors did not press too hard. He mi I the
failure was brought about by by the com
petition in the grocery business, which
compelled the firm to sell at ' ruinous
figures. "If we had not advertised exten
sively, put our prices down to the lowest
figure and employed all the enterprise we
possess to *e!_l goods, we would have been
here idle, while customers were going in
droves to the Emporium."

LEVIN TALKS.
j The Head of the Firm Explains the
Situation and His Hopes.
Julius Levin, who is the moving spirit
in the firm, while apparently much exer
cised over the trouble into which the es
tablishment has become involved, ap
j peared confident that when the creditors
! became thoroughly familiar with the situ
tion they would show him and his
brothers every consideration. His princi
pal worry when seen last evening in his
place of business was that his stores might
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1896.
be closed and his business crippled to
such au extent that recovery would be
extremely difficult. All his energies wero
directed toward preventing this yester
day, and with every promise of success.
In speaking, of the past experience of
the firm and the present embarrassment
ho was frank and oaispoken, and made
no attempt either to evade questions or
conceal any information. In the course
of an interview he made the following
statement:
"The only way that I can account for
this trouble is thÂ« business depression
that has been prevalent everywhere in the
country for the past few year.*. As a re
sult, of this we were driven to keener com
petition than usual, and profits were cut
to a very low notch. At the same time
our expenses were' heavy and accounts
were difficult to collect. There were alsb
other sources of loss which I do not care
to make public, but which were a serious
drain, considering that we had five stores
and employed from forty to fifty hands.
"We have been in business in this City
for twenty years and always paid every
body dollar for dollar. This is our
first trouble. We have always been con
sicered by the general trade as Al, and
our credit was of the best.
"We ha-.'e bought, in this market on an
ye rage $30,000 to $35,000 worth of goods
per month for the last two years, and have
until very recently met all our obligations
promptly, as any of our creditors will tell
you. Even within the last thirty days we
have paid out in the neighborhood of
$28, â¬00 to our creditors, and as recently as
the 26th of the present month wo pa ; d to
one of our creditors our check for $2600.
"My principal anxiety now is to re
open regularly for business as quickly as
possible. We have done everythina
possible to protect our credit We saw the
storm coming a few days ago, and thought
the best thing to do was to adopt tbe plan
we carriel out. We notified our creditors
and asked that they at once call a meeting
to act on our affairs. This was done on
Tuesday, a.nd notwithstanding this
straightforward course that we pursued,
one of our creditors, E. Martin & Co.,
liquor dealers, attached our Market-street
place for a claim of $400 to-day.
"This was followed later by an attach
ment by the Standard Soap Coinpanv on
our Sixth-street store for a claim of $670.
We expect to have both attachments re
leased to-morrow, when our affairs will be
placed entirely in the hands of the as
signees selected by the Board of Trade
committees. The assignees are J. P.
Edoffs of the firm of Dalieniand & Co., A.
L. Whitney of C. E. Whitney & Co. and
Jacob Levy of H. Levy & Co. Frank F.
Strelzer is now in charge ot affairs as the
representative of the assignees.
"We shall use every effort to prepare a
complete statement of our business be
tween now and Monday, and shall work
every day nnd night until then without
intermission so as to have it ready for the
next meetinc of the creditors which is to
be held on Monday at 10 a. m.
"I am confident that our assets will
reach between 70 and 80 per cent of our
liabilities.
"We have always bought in this market
and always gave home productions the
preference. Ido not think that we have
bought more than $4000 worth of goodi
East and that only within the last two
years." _____^_____
TIHE FARALLON SCHOOL,
What Miss Daisy Doud, Ap
pointee of the School Board,
May Expect to Encounter.
An Interesting S ory, TÂ»nd in Letters,
of Life on the Rockbound Haunts
of the Seagull.
MisQ Daisy Doud, the pretty young
teacher appointed at the last session oi
the Board of Education to teach the young
idea at the Farallon Islands how to
shoot, will not, it seems, have everything
her own way.
When school facilities at the islands be
came imperative last fall Lighthouse
keeper Beeman, who it appears is mon
arch of the romantic, rock bound demesne,
applied for the establishment of a school
and ihe appointment of a teacher. He
was told in so many words that the City
of Sati Francisco could not afford to pay
the teachers it had, much less provide
new ones for ten pupils on an oceau ex
crescence.
Nothing daunted Mr. Beeman deter
mined to engage a first-class teacher in
his own capiicity as a private citizen and
applied to Principal Rnberison of the
Hamilton Grammar School for a 1 vice.
Mr.' Robertson, after due consideration,
selected Miss Ellen M. Hensel, who had
proved of the highest rank in the Girte'
Hieh School and the third highest in
Miss Fowler's Normal School. An at
tempt was made to have Miss Hensel ap
pointed by the board, bnt she was in
formed privately that her influence to
that end was inadequate.
Anyway, Miss Hensel was engaged by
Mr. Beeman to teach the young Farallon
ites. She signed a contract on November
15 for six month* ot $10 a month and !
board, and on November 17 last was taken
by Principal Robertson to the island,
where she has remained ever since.
Her mother, Mrs. M. J. Payne of this
City, was wonderinjt yesterday what would
be the result of the board's appointment.
''There are less than ten pupils on the
island," said she, "and how is Miss Daisy
;:oui.r to divide them nj> with my Ellen?
Of course. nÂ»v daughter stands very high â
higher than MisÂ«Doud â in her profession,
and it seems unjust that the latter should
receive $60 a month for what my daughter
does, or half of what she doe?, for $10. I
do not wish to say anything against Miss
Doud, who is douoticss a nice girl and
perfectly innocent in the matter. The
fault ana the burden seem to lie with the
oppressive political system.
'â¢But 1 fear that Miss Doud will not find
everything to her taste on the Farallones.
Judging t>y letters irom my daughter she
is a complete exile, not able to visit her
mother during her six months' service,
and only able to communicate irregularly
by mail. The regular letters go every
three months, but by arrangement with
kindly pilots I manage to got word to and
from her about every two weeks. My
Christmas present ot books to lighten her
banishment has not yet reached her, and
in stormy weather communication is com
pletely cut off."
Nevertheless Miss Hensel seems quite
happy. Following are some interesting
extracts discreetly made from recent let
ters received by MÂ»9. Payne from her
bright daughter on the island :
Don't be worrying about me falling off the
rocks; I can climb iikÂ« a goat. â¢ â¢ â¢ Write
often. I'll get your letters some time and they
are just as welcome old hs new. * â¢ * Your
letter mailed on the 15th (this is the 22d of
December) cr.me on Sunday, ho you see the
piiot-boai is the quickest way. â¢ â¢ * There is
no piano on the island. * * â¢ I will have
but three scholars lor several months. * â¢ â¢
1 shall stay until May 17; then if I want to
stay longer I can do so, which is a great com
lori, for then I cau take mv vacation and find
out about other schools in Jniie or July. â¢ â¢ â¢
I must have a sun bonnetâ it is ihe only thing
I can keep on my head. â¢ â¢â  â¢ You sec mail
and things only come through the lighthouse
office every three month*. * â¢ * We had
greens for dinner last Sunday. They are the
only green things that grow here naturally.
It is something between a crass and a weed.
The greens are splendid I think. â¢ â¢ â¢ Mrs.
Bcemrtti is very much disappointed that the
things lor the children's Christmas have not
come y e t. They believe firmly in Santa
Claus and will be much disappointed
if they have no tTee. â¢ â¢ â¢ Mrs. Beeman
is very, very nice to me, in fact everybody on
the island is very kind. The schoolhouse is
about half a block from Mr. Beeman's house.
I have a lolding lounge in the front room, and
when I shut the door I can be alOne. I am at
the schooiliouse now. It has four rooms and
was used as a dwehing-house when the light
house was first built. The hunso lÂ« plas
tered and is very nice and warm. I have
three windows in the schoolroom, so there is
plenty of light there. I huve nine desks, so
you see I have room for five more scholars. â¢
* * I wish you could look out of my window
now and see the breakers dashing upon Saddle
Bock!
SCHOOL DIRECTORS
IN A SQUABBLE
Messrs. Henderson and
Knox Nearly Come to
Blows.,
The Rae Building Company Will
Build the Mission High
School.
G. C. Sweeney Gets tbe Contract for
the Plumbin; and Gas*
F.tting.
Two school directors wero painfully
polite to each other at the meeting of the
Board of Education last evening and for
good reasons. They nearly came to blows
during a meeting of the committee of the
whole that preceeded the regular meeting.
A disgraceful scene was only averted by
the intervention of cooler-headed mem
bers.
The contract for heating and ventilating
the new Mission High School was under
discussion and Director Henderson took
up the cudgels for one contractor and Di
rector Knox for another.
When the discussion grew heated the
latter remarked that it seemed very much
as though Director Henderson had given
his friends points on how much to bid.
The excitable Henderson was on his feet
in an instant and applying an ephithet to
Director Knox made a rush at him wiih
clenched fists. The latter did not rise to
meet the threatened attack and other
members prevented further hostilities.
The contract for tbe erection of the new
Mission High School building on the
plans of A' Jiiteot Charles J. Havens was
awarded to the Rae Building and Con
tracting Company for the sum of $123, 905,
the company being considered the lowest
responsible bidder.
The resolution awarding the contract
specified that Roman buff, brick and steel
laths should be used in the building an 1
that the award was contingent on the
Bond of the company in the sum of $30,977
beincr satisfactory to the board.
The plumbing and gasfitting contract
was let to G. C. Sweeny for the sum of
$4134, and his bond was fixed at $1033 50.
Miss May E. Strauss, a member of the
day substitute class, was transferred from
the Hamilton Evening School to the posi
tion of regular teacher in the school.
Miss Belle Levingston was elected a
THE TWIN BROTHERS WRIGHT.
regular teacher of stenosraphy and type
writing in the Mission High School class
connected with the Horace Mann Gram
mar School.
Mr". E. M. North, Mrs. F. Haynes and
Mrs. L. A. Shaw, probationary teachers of
ten or more years' experience, were
elected regular teachers.
An attempt was made to elect a superin
tendent of construction for the new High
School building, Joseph Curlett, I. P.
Kincaid and D. O'Sullivan being nomi
nated for the place, bul after several bal
lots hftd been taken without lesult the
matter was put over until Saturday after
noon, when another meeting is to be held.
The following recommendations of the
City Board of Examiners were adopted:
That John B.Clarke be granted a High
School certificate on his diploma of
graduation from thÂ» University of Cali
fornia and letter of recommendation from

ers' Association Takes a Successful
Benefit at the Columbia.
A very successful benefit was given last

travelers and their iriends, and the per
formance of "His Wife's Father" by the
Frawley Company was received with warm
applause.
At the close of the second act the presi
dent of the association, J. C. Eubanks,
was introduced by the ex-president, W. J.
Barrett, and in a few brief and well-chosen
remarks lie welcomed the large audience
and explained the objects of the beneiiciarv
fund. "The entertainment piven you by
the Frawley Company is well worth your
dollar?," he said, "but it will be an added
pleasure to you to think that your money
will bring a little sunshino into the be
reaved homes of commercial men who
have packed their grips for the last time
and who have made their last journey."
The president's remarks were received
with warm applause.
Elegant New Year souvenir programmes
were given, each shaped in the form of a
circle and bearing in gilt letters on a pale
gray ground the initials P. C. C. T. A., the
initials of the organization.

A LEGISLATOR'S DOUBLE
Assemblyman Wright of Ala
meda Has a Twin
Brother.
Ha Uses Him to Help Clear His Office
of Placj-Kunters and
Cranks.
"Excuse me, you must be thinking of
my brother," says Howard E. Wright,
when approached on subjects relating to
the coming session of the Legislature.
"Oh, I think you must want to see my
brother, Assemblyman Wright," says the
brother when like matters are broached to
him.
Howard E. Wright was elected to the
State Assembly from the Fifty-first Dis-
trict, which is in Alamedn. County, at the
late election, and with in a week he wasbe
sieced by nnxiou3 constituents who wanted
offices or desired him to father measures
that would work to their interests.
They talked to him on the boats and on
the cars and on the streets, and they even
followed him home and poured their as
pirations into his ears,
Now, Mr. Wright has a twin brother, D.
C. Wright, who is as like him as one pea
In a pod is like another. Their features
are very similar, both wear Vandyke
beards and both aid their vision by the
use of glasses. Moreover, they dress very
much alike, ana it is a keen observer who
can distinguish them apart. Indeed, their
near friends often mistake Howard E. for
the brother, and vice versa.
So it happened that tne twin Wright
who is not an Assemblyman-elect was
also besieged by office-hunters and the
like, who thought they were talking to a
statesman and a man of might in the
councils of the Legislature.
The man who is not a Solon told his
brother of the wav iie was badgered, and a
happy thought strucK the latter.
"When they tackle you." he said, "yon
can truthfully say that it is a mistake, and
I will tell them to go and see you. Of
course I will not prevaricate and say I am
not Assemblyman-elect Wright, but I can
give the impression easy enough without
that."
So it was arranged, and the aforesaid
constituents nave grown weary of asking
men who resemble Assemblyman Wright
for legislative favors.
It is shrewdly suspected that ths man
who was elected to the Assembly made
good use of his brother during the cam
paign that closed on November 3, for it
was remarked at the time that the insur
ance man was numerous about Alameda
County during the few weeks preceding
election and that his energy must have
been great to have kept up under the
strain. There were several other candi
dates in the Fifty-first, but Wright wore
them all out and was elected by a com
fortable moprity.
Those who are hoping for favors at the
hands of the Assemblyman-elect are won
dering if the brother will be in eyidencs
at Sacramento when the Legislature
meets and be also as repdy to remark.
"Am Imy brother's keeper? " or words to
that effect.
Assembly man-elect Wright resides on
East Twenty-eighth street. East Oakland,
and is in the insurance business in this
City.
The Chess Tournament.
Arrangements nre now complete for the
chess match by telegraph between the Vic
toria, (B. C.) Chess Club.and tlie Mechanics'
Institute Chess Players on New Year's night.
The team playing for the Mechanics' Institute
will be Rodney Kendrick, Walter Franklin,
Otcar Samuel.H and Valentine Huber. They
will play in the Mechanics' Institute cQess
room, and a special wire from the room will
communicate the moves here and receive the
moves from Victoria.
The next lecture in the Mechanics' Institute
course will be given by Fiona Eunice Waife,
on "Cuba and the Cubans," illustrated, on
next Saturday night. The lecture will be free
to members and their friends.
Dismissed From the Force.
The Police Commissioners met last night and
dismissed Policeman Thomas W. Stevens of
Captain Splllane's division from the force.
Stevens' offi-nsc w as being in a saloon while
0 n duty on December 22.
FIGHTING FOR
ASSEMBLY SEATS
Joseph Morani Files a
. Contest in the Forty-
Fourth District.
Taking of Testimony in the
Hosy â¢ Powers Case Began
Yesterday.
Witnesses Who Saw Ballots Pat in
the Box Without the Numbers
Being First Torn Off.
Edward 8. Ryan, who was declared by
the Election Commissioners to be the suc
cessful candidate for the Forty-fourth As
sembly District, will not be allowed to
take bis seat in the Legislature without a
contest.
James Morani, who was defeated by a
few votes, has filed notice that he will isk
the Legislature to declare him elected.
He charges that there was fraud in
every precinct of the district, and that
Ryan not only used money to gain votes
but promised political preferment to a
large number of men, who will so testify.
In addition to these charges Morani
says that Ryan was not a resident of the
Forty-fourth Assembly District for a year
prior to the election, and is, therefore, in
eligible to hold the seat.
The contest of Hoey vs. Powers for the
seat in tbe Assembly from the Thirty
second Assembly D. strict began yesterday
when Justices Kerrigan and Groezinger,
sitting as referees in the former's court
room, heard testimony on the matter.
Powers was elected by a narrow margin
and declared the successful candidate by
the Election Commissioners. The con
testant charges gross irregularities in the
counting and handling of the ballots, and
the testimony taken yesterday will be
presented to the Legislature, which will
decide which is entitled to the seat.
Policeman Murphy, who was on watch
in the booth of the First Precinct of the
Thirty-second, testified that he had seen
a number ol ballots â six or seven, perhaps
â put into the ballot-box without the
numbers having first been torn off. He
had called the attention of the election
officers to tie matter and told them that
the proceeding was against tbe law, but
no attention was paid to him.
Frank D3rragh, a watcher for the Citi
zens' Republican ticket, testified to a like
state of affairs. He stated that he had
seen over fifty ballots go into the box with
the numbers still attached. Like the
policeman he had called the attention of
the election officers to tbe irregularity
and had even read the law to them, but it
made no difference.
Tbenumbers were on the ballots when
taken from the box and were torn oS as
they were being counted.
John Reilly, also a watcher, stated that
he had seen a number of ballots that
should have been counted for Hoey thrown
out. The crosses were evidently intended
for the nameot the contestant but bad
been placed either directly after the name
or on the Jine separating it from the square
intended to hold the cros*.
When he asked why the votes were not
given to Hoey he was told that it was none
of his business and that the cross was not
in the proper place to be counted.
â¦
PHILIP CODE CONTESTS.
Assemblyman-Elect Mahoney Must
Defend His Rght to the
Office.
Philip D. Code Jr, has filed notice that
he contests the ri>rht of P. E. Mahoney to
a seat in the legislature from the Thirty
fourth Assembly District. Mr. Code
alleges many acts oi neglect and miscon
duct on the part of the election officers.
Also that watchers legally appointed were
excluded from the voting booths.
It is further averred in the complaint
that 250 voters were illegally induced to
vote for Mr. Mahoney by the payment of
money, and that such illegal votes were
cast and counted for Mr. Mahoney.
It is believed by Mr. Code that if the
votes had been properly canvassed he
would have been elected and in view of
this state of facts Mr. Code asks that Mr.
Mahoney be excluded from the office and
that he be declared entitled to the seat.
Justices of the Peace Barry and
Groezinger have been appointed commis
sioners to taka testimony and report the
same to the Legislature. John K. Aitken
i 3 attorney for the contestant.
THE LABOR QUESTION.
A Profitable Visit Paid the Labor
Bureau by an Assembly Committee
of Six.
That the next Legislature of this State
will pay more attention to the labor ques
tion than hitherto was evidenced yester
day by the visit of an Assembly com
mittee of six paid the Labor Bureau on
gutter street. The committee consisted cf
Assemblymen Strain of Del Norte, Cano
van of Marin and Kelly, Mahoney, God
frey and Powers of San Francisco.
The various laws proposed by the
bureeu and placed in the form of bills for
presentation to the Legislature were dis
cussed with Mr. Fitzgerald for about two
hours. The committee was eminently
satisfied with thÂ« proposed laws.
Two, one relating to the reorganization
of the bureau and the other regulating
employment agents, came in for special
commendation. Mr. Fitzgerald was well
pleased at the comments made.
There are 1,700,000 more men in the
United States than women.

Judge Seawall's Decision
Removes Lsgal Ob
structions.
Holds That the Granting of the
Franchise Cannot Be
Reviewed.
Attorney Crittenden Says That Over
a Million Dollars Will Ba
Invested
Prospects of the people of San Francisco
for securing an opposition telephone com
pany were increased by the opinion of
Judge Seawell yesterday in ttie matter of
the application of George H. Gauld for a
writ of review directed to the Board of Su
pervisors of the City and County of San
Francisco.
The material facts admitted by the de
murrer are substantially as follows:
On March 7. 1896, tbe People's Mutual
Telephone Company, a corporation, made
to the Board of Supervisors of
\his City and County, for a franchise to
*w down and operate telephone and tele
aph lines in said City and County. On
lUr^V 21. 1896, the board adopted a form of
ordinance by which it proposed to grant
said franchise, and in which were stated
tbe terms and conditions upon which it
would be granted, and also passed certain
resolutions directing the cleric of the board
to advertise for proposals for said fran
chise and to publisn, as required by law,
a notice setting forth that an application
had been made for such franchise, that it
was proposed to grant the same to the
highest bidder therefor, and that proposals
would be received therefor on Monday af
ternoon, September 31, 1896, from 2:30 to
3 o'clock; but that no proposals for said
franchise in any sum less than $1000
would be entertained by the board. The
name of the newspaper in which said no
lice should be published, and also the
number of days on which said publication
should be made, were designated in said
resolutions.
It is not alleged in the petition that any
action lias been taken by the board subse
quent to the 21st day of July, 1896, or that
any grant has been made of the franchise
to any one. In dealing with the law
governing this case Judge Seawell said:
It is well settled that only a final determina
tion of a tribunal or board can be reviewed on
a Droceeding of tnis character. PeoDle vs.
County Judge, 40 C'ai.. 479; Wilson vs. Board
of Supervisors, 3 Cal., 386.
AH" that the board nas so far done is to de
clare that it proposes to grant the franchise
applied lor to tbe highest bidder, to state the
terms and conditions of the grant and to
direct the clerk :o publish a notice inviting
bids and specifying the time when they will
be received by the board.
The board will not have taken any final
r.ciion in the matter of the francnise until it
shall have either made or refused to make a
grant of the franchise.
I am further of opinion that the proceedings
sought to be reviewed are legislative and not
judicial in character. The action thus far
taken by the board goes no farther than to i
specify the terms and condition? of the pro- |
posed" grant. The act of the board in fixing \
such terms and conditions is no more judicial â 
than would be an ordinance fixing ge terally
rfthe terms and conditions upon which licenses
rto sell liquor will be granted. Whoever re
[ reives a grant oi the franchise will be bound
I ly those terms and conditions.
The distinction between legislative and
judicial acts is well illustrated by the Supreme
Court ol Sew Jersey as follows:
"A;i ordinance prescribing the conditions
upon which streets should be laid out or im
proved ii ud the procedure to be adopted in ac
complishing these purposes would, 1 suppose,
be clearly legislative iv charaier. An ordi
nance, however, inying cut a particular street
or ordering it to be paved, would be judicial
in quality. So an ordinance fixing the quali
fications uf applicants lor license to sell liquor
and the conditions upo'i which licenses
should be granted would be legislative, while
the granting or a license to a person is judi
cial."âWest Jersey Traction Company vs.
Board ot Public Works, etc.; 29 All. Rue, 163.
The proceedings of the Board of Supervisors,
thus far hari, being neither final nor judicial,
the demurrers to the petition will be sus
tained.
Having reached the conclusion that the
acnon oi the beard is not subject to review in
this proceeding-, it is not proper that I should
express an opinion upon the other questions
in the case. To do ao would be to attempt the
exercise of juii&dicuon after having decided
that I had none.
Deputy City Attorney W. I. Brobeck
argued the case on behalf of the Super
visors, and Attorney James L. Crittedec
represented the new company. Mr. Bro
beck looks upon Judge Seawell's decision
as a victory for the company, and it is
thought that no further legal obstruction
will be met with.
Mr. Crittenden reports tbati over a
million dollars will be invested in tbe new
enterprise and that work will be begun at
once and pushed ahead with all possible
expedition.
NICARAGUA CANAL.
Hasty Completion Depends I'pcn En
ergy of C'oaÂ«t Congressmen.
The duty of hastening the completion
of the Nicaragua canal is now thought to
devolve upon the Congressional repre
sentatives from the Pacific Coast, the
commercial advancement of which de
pends largely upon the establishment of
cheaper transportation rates to and from
Eastern markets. The following letter
just received by the San Francisco Cham
ber of Commerce from a prominent mem
ber of the New York Stock Exchange is
interesting and self-explanatory:
: : New York, Dec 22, 1896.
Captain WVliam L. Merryâ Dear Captain:
The Nicaragua canai bill has been reported
favorably by both the Senate and House com
mittees of this Congress. -
The bills are on tne calendars, and can be
passed if the Congressional delegates from the
Pacific Coast are equal to the responsibilities
which they have assumed for their constitu
ents.
The argument first and last find all the
time to be presented by the Pacific Coast is
that business can never revive under present
conditions. The canal will open up new
channels of business, and will shorten the dis
tance to the best markets of the world over
10.000 miles.
It will open trade for the lumber, grain,
hops, fish and fruits of the Pacific Coast, and
thus bring population and wealth beyond the
dreams of the most optimistic. Estimates of
the probable increase of population following
the opening of the Nicaragua canal are made
by those familiar with the present conditions
of the Pacific Coast, and it is reasonably ex
pected that the â  population will increase 100
per cent withhi five years after the comple
tion of the canal, and will be multiplied lour
times within twenty years following.
1 The Paciflj Coast Is vitally interested in this
matter and the canal will be commenced be
fore July 1, 1897, if a united effort is made by
the Pacific (oast's representatives in Congress
in pushing the bills to completion during the
present session. ' /
When the canal is finished the iron from
AlaDania should be laid down at the doors of
the machine-shops and' consumers of the Pa
cific Coast at a cost of $10 a ton; .' '-,: '-'-',t
r Other products from, foreign and' American
1 tarkets would stimulate new industries which
ould add largely to . the wealth ' and prosper
ity of the Pactflc Coast. .';"" ;"â¢â¢â¢:â¢--.â¢â¢'
The Pacific Coast can attract no new' settlers
to increase-its pooulatlon until the United
States Government assures the world that this
great highway of commerce will be completed
and under its control, therefore it rests largely,
with the people of ; the Pacific Coast, who are
now suffering from grave disadvantages us to
markets and commercial and manufacturing j
fÃcilitics, as to how soon they are to be eman
cipated from present conditions. Very truly,
Horace C. Hotchkiss.
THEIR BLIGHTED LOVE.
Herman Brauollch Arre*ted for Vag-
rancy and Ho Blames His Mother-
In-Ldw.
Herman C. Braunlich, a painter, 35 years
of age, living at 514 Sutter street, was ar
rested Tuesday on a warrant charging
him with vagraucy on the complaint of
E. Fautsch.
Braunlich attributes his arrest to the
vengeance of his mother-in-law and says
that Fautsch, who swore to the complaint
against him, is a tool in her hands,
because he wanted to marry her daughter
before she fell in love with Braunlich.
About a year ago Braunlich was em
ployed by Mrs. Emma K. Loving, a
wealthy widow of 2409 Sacramento street,
to do some painting work in a large build
ing she was erecting at Piedmont. He
met Mary, the handsome daughter of the
widow, who was only 19 years of age, and
they fell in love with each other and
eloped. They were married at Hay wards,
just v few minutes before Mrs. .Loving ap
peared upon the scene.
TliÂ« newly married pair lived together
for a few months and then their troubles
began, and Mrs. Braunlich left her hus
band to live with her mother. On Octo
ber 15 Brauniich was served with papers
calling for a divorce la a suit instituted
by his wife, and the case is still pending.
"My wife," said Braunlich last night,
"is even now anxious to live with me, but
her mother will not allow her and lias
compelled her to institute divorce pro
ceedings against me. She has done every
thing to drive my wife against me and
ruin me, and lias got this old man
Fautsch to help her. Fautsch was in love
with my wife before we were married and
I believe if he had a chance he would kill
me.
"I am no vagrant, as any one who
knows me will testify. I have letters of
recommendation fi-om prominent men for
whom I have done work, and I am work
ing at my trade now. I am quite able
and willing to support my wiie and no
one knows that better than my mother
in-law."
The case was called in Judge Camp
bell's court yesterday, but was continued
tili January 3. Bramlich was released on
bonds.
FOR EXCLUSIVE CONTROL
The War Department Is Ask
ing for Legislative
Action.
California the Only State Where the
Civil Authorities Can Act on a
Mi itary R s?rvalion.
Some time ago certain civilians were
found trespassing upon the military reser
vation at the Presidio, and Colonel Gra
ham undertook to prevent them from
continuing the trespass, which was tbe
removal of sand from the beach, but was
j told that he had no right to interfere.
Tbe matter cot into conn and the mili
tary authorities, who allowed the case to
go by default, discovered that when the
territory was set aside by the State for
military purposes, the United States was
not given the exclusive right that was
vesied in every other State in the Union,
and that the civil authorities have juris
l diction over the territory.
To remedy this the attention of the. War
Department was called to the matter and
a communication was addressed to Gover
nor H. H. Markbam with a view to nave
, the State Legislature take action so as to

Several of the men who are to compose
the Bohemian team, consisting of men
of the army and the navy, announced to
meet the University Club team of football
players, were engaged in practice yester
day. They are perfecting themselves, so
as to give tne university boys a hard
tussle for the game. It has in its make
up three iirst-class menâ Nolan and Mc-
Corinick, ends, and Ames, who played
center for the Olympics. Another first
class player will arrive iiere about a week
before the game. He is King, the full
back of the West Point team, and he will
play that position for the Bohemians. A
great deal of interest is being taken in
army circles in this game.
A CHARGE OF CRUELTY.
The Sailors of the Otterburn Complain
of the Officers.
A dozen sailors of the British ship Otter
burn, from Cape Town, South Africa, en
tered the office of the United States Dis
trict Attorney Tuesday and complained
that they had been ill treated by the cap
tain and mate, who had sent them ashore
and refused to pay them their wage?.
Trie master is Captain Hunter and the
mate's name is Howse. According to the
gtory of the men they baJ been poorly
! fed and subjected to the worst kind of
abuse from the day they sailed to the day
of their arrival. The sailors asserted that
the captain was given to drinking, and
that recently while chasing one of the
men he fell and cut himself badly.
They charge Mate Howse with follow
ing the example of the captain so far as
harsh treatment is concerned. The sail
ors state that they were even shipped
against their will. When they went
aboard and saw the food they refused to
sign, and claim that the captain for all
this would not let them go ashore.
Among these was J. Watson, a soldier
in the King's Own Royal Rifles, who had
deserted his company. Most of the men
asserted that they are not sailors, but
farmers, who desired to come to Cali
fornia. They say that when the captain
put t: em ashore he threatened to cut
them to pieces if they bothered him about
wages.
As the Otterburn is a British ship toe
complaint will be made to the British
Consul.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 31, 1896.
MRS. EDGERTON TO
TREAD THE BOARDS
Will Appear at the Baldwin
Theater With Mme.
Modjeska.
To Make Her Initial Bow as
Queen Elizabeth in " Mary
Stuart."
Society Is Interested in the Profes
sional Debut of the Elocu
tionist.
Mrs. Frances Edgerton, society leader,
reader and elocutionist, has decided to
add her name to the already long list of
fashionable women who have adopted a
theatrical career.
No less a personage than the tragedy
queen, Mme. Modjeaka, is to stand sponsor
for the lady's initial effort, which is to be
made in the role of Queen Elizabeth in
Scniller's immortal traeedy, "Mary
Stuart"
Mrs. Edgerton's debut in professional
life will be watched with unusual interest
by her largs circle of society friends. For
the past five years the lady has been much
before the public as a reader and elocu
tionist, still finding time to devote herself
to the arduous duties of a brilliant social
life.
With her sister, Mrs. Homer King, she
has entertained extensively, and their
Mrs. r ranees ndgerton.
home on tbe corner of Pine and Leaven
worth streets has been the scene of many
eleeant entertainments.
Mrs. E igerton takes her professional
debut calmly, and looks upon her future
career in the world behind tbe footlights
with the eyes of one. who has stripped the
life of all tne glittering environments.
"It is at Mme. Modjeska's earnest de
sire that 1 make the attempt," said the
lady, after she had modestly admitted
her coming appearance at tne Baldwin,
"and it will be my earnest desire to ful
fill her very kind anticipations.
"Elizabeth is a role that is exactly in
my line, and if I do not give a great ren
dering of the part I certainly shall give an
intelligent reading of the iines.
"As yet I have formed no definite plans
for the future. Much will depend upon
my reception, both by the press and the
public, and until I find out exactly what I
can do I would prefer not to discuss the
subject"
Mrs. Edgerton will not, for the present
at least, give up her work in reading and
elecution.
To-day Manager Bourier is to decide
whether Mrs. Edgerton is to appear in any
other plays beside "Mary Stuart," and
tbe lady is to be given her first part.
If the earnest wishes of a host of friends
means success, then Mrs. Edgerton's fame
is a foregone conclusion.
THE SAN BENITO WRECK
It Has Cost the Licenses of
Captain Smith and Mate
Z)iling.
Inspectors Found the Same Old Story,
No Casts of tbe Lead
Were Made.
Aside from the great loss ot life and
property, the wrecking of the steame|San
Benito has cost Captain 'William Smith
and Chief Mate R. Zolling their licenses.
The United States local board of inspec
tors of steam vessels yesterday gave a
decision which deprived the parties named
of the right to perform the duties of
captain and pilot hereafter, and the reason
given for this decision was that the men
were grossly negligent and unskillful in
the management of the collier.
The inspectors, after reviewing the tes
timony, made the following remarks:
Had Captain Smith put lÂ»ss confidence in
his log and reckoning and taken a cast of bis
lead when be at 12:25 a. m. changed his
course, he would hare lonnd that his ship was
nearer to the land than he calculated. A more
cautious master would have done so after run
ning along the coast 240 miles without being
able to confirm his position by bearings of the
land or good observations, especially at tnat
season of the year.
After a careful and full consideration of the
evidence produced, we are of the opinion that
Captain William Smith was negligent and un
skillful In navigating the steamer San Benito
under his command November 22. * * *
Therefore, by the authority conferred upon
us by section 4450, United States Revised
Statutes, we hereby revoke the license oi Cap
tain WiliUm Smith on account of negligence
and unskillfulnesH in the navigation of the
steamer San Benito, and he is hereby pro
hibited from exercising the duties prescribed
In said license as master and pilot of steam
vessels.
The chief mate"s license was revoked on
the same grounds.
BONNER EXONERATED.
The Policeman Did Not Fire at Bag
Cornell and 111 m Siiter.
Policeman Steve Bonner, who was ac
cused of firing a shot at Ray Cornell and
his sister at an early hour of Saturday
morning, December 19, has been complete
ly exonerated by Chief Crowley.
Bonner' s account of the affair is that the
morning was very foggy, and about 2
o'clock he saw as he supposed two young
men crossing the panhandle of the park
He called to them asking what they were
doing there at that hour, and one of them
ran. Tne other remarked, "Don't run, I'll
fix him." Bonner called out, "Hold on,
I am an officer," and as he approached
nearer the other also ran away and disap
peared in the fofÂ«
Suspecting something was wrong Bon
ner blew his whistle and fired a shot from
his revolver into the air to attract th i at
tention ot other officers in the locality,
and Policeman Hostetter responded. They
searched the panhandle, but found no
trace of the two supposed young men.
Bonner reported the case to Captain Witt
man that morning.
The girl wore a long ulster and a Fedora
hat, which accounted for Bonner mistak
ing the two for young men.
THE GUATEMALA EXHIBIT.
A Meeting of Exhibitors Result* in the
Project Being Pushed With
Vigor.
The executive committee of the mer
chants and others interested in the Cali
fornia exhibit at tbe Guatemala Exposi
tion met yesterday at the rooms of the
State Board of Trade. Charles Bundschu
occupied the chair.
Secretary Carl H. Clark reported having
received fourteen signatures to a request
to exhibit, ajtgregatin g 2500 square feet of
the 4000 allowed for the California ex
hibit. California's exhibit, if the entire
space be filled, will take up one-fifth of
the room availnbls in the whole United
States building.
At the last meeting of the committee a
sub-committee â composed of Louis Hirsch
of Castle Bros., who left on the steamer
for Guatemala yesterday, and James Hogg
of the Sperry Flour Company â was ap
pointed to interview Mr. Schwerin, vice
president of the Pacific Alail Steamship
Company, to see what could be done as
regards rates.
They reported yesterday that the com
pany would charge regular rates in taking
all exhibits to Guatemala, but would
charge nothing for their reiurn.
Mr. Schwerin also stated that he would
donate $1000 toward mating and main
taining an exhibit, provided a joint con
tribution of $10,000 could be raised.
EGAN WILL BE HONORED
The Olympic Directors Ha T e
Decided to Give the Boxer
a Handsome Prize.
Director Howard Taylor Is Writing
a Play and Remains Up Nights
to Catch Inspiration.
The directors of the Olympic Club held
a special meeting Tuesday and, as stated
in The Call, they decided to close
the outdoor grounds immediately, owing
to the small interest that has been mani
fested among the members in outdoor
athletics. Peter Mclntyre, the care-taker,
will be assigned to a position in the club.
Considerable discussion resulted over
the decision which was rendered by
George Green, the referee of the late box
iuc contests.
Green decided in ravorof Hayes without
consulting the judges, hence the "kick"
on the part of bgan's friends, who stated
openly that Egan was not accorded fair
play. The directors decided that they
had no jurisdiction in the matter; that ac*
cording to all athletic rules a referee's de
cision is final and that ended it. They,
however, voted to give Egan a handsome
prize as a means of soothing his injured
feelings. In all probability the officers of
the Amateur Athletic Association will De
asked to appoint two judges and a referee
to act in future when boxing contests are
given by the club.
Howard Taylor, the leader, is arranging
for a series of athletic event?, which will
be held in the club durir.tr the months of
January, February and March. A grand
vaudeville performance will be given in
the latter part of January, a wrestling
tourncment in February, open to ail
amateurs; a handball and billiard tourna
ment in Marcli. In fact, every depart
ment of the club will, so to speak, have an
inning and the quarter wili terminate with
a ladies' ni'.'ht, which Mr. Taylor says
will be par excellence.
Messrs. Taylor and Rosborough, both of
whom are theatrical critics from "away
back," incidentally remarked that a great
surprise is in store for the boys ot the
club. The gentlemen of athletic and the
atrical proclivities are now engaged in
writing a burlesque, which, when com
pleted, will be introduced by the Olympic
minstrels in some of the local theaters.
According to Jack Mallon, the champion
feather-weight ball-player, William Greer
Harrison as a playwright will prove "not
in it" with the inimitable Taylor, whose
fame is yet under cover.
YOUNG REPUBLICANS.
The League Passes a Resolution In-
dorsing Judge James A. Waymire
for a Cabinet Position.
The Young Men's Republican League at
a largely attended meeting at 220 O'Farrell
street Tuesday night passed the following
resolution, which has been signed by Presi
dent Frank K. Spencer and Secretary E.
C. McCullough, and will be forwarded to
the proper quarter:
Whereas, The Young Men's Republican
League oi ban Francisco was one of the earliest
organizations formed on behalf' of the Hon.
William McKinley for President of the United
States, and by its energetic labors for the cause
of protection and sound money brought into
the membership 1700 active and energetic
young men in the City aud County of San
Francisco, whose influence upon others, not
members, helped to hold San Francisco in the
Republican column; and whereas, we recog
nize in Judge James A. Waymire a representa
tive Kepubiican and citizen, vho was from the
beginning foremost In the struggle to secure
the nomination of McKinley and his subse
quent election ; now, therefore, be it
Resolved, That we do hereby indorse him as
a gentlemen fit .n every way to occupy a place
in the Cabinet of the President-elect, and
most earnestly solicit his appointment, be
lieving that it will be most useful in ho. ding
the elements of the Republican party of this
City aud State together for luture usefulness.
LITTLE INFANTS' SHELTER.
Christmas Festival to Fifty Little Tots
In the Minna-Street Home.
The managers of the Little Sisters' In
fant Shelter at 512 Minna street gave a
Christmas festival to the little ones at the
home yesterday afternoon. The school
room had been prettily decorated with
garlands of colored paper made by the
little inmates, and in one corner was &
Christmas tree laden with caudies and
toys.
There were present abont fifty little tots
and a number of ladies. Under the diiec
tion of Miss Josie Kently, the teacher of
tne little ones, there were son^s and reci
tations, and then the distribution of the
good things. Then the children were
treated to a glorious dinner.
The managers have within the past few
months received so many little children
to care for that they have been iorced to
convert every room into a dormitory.
They are now so crowded tney can scarcely
accommodate those under their care.
They expected long before this to build a
new home with monoy bequeathed to the
shelter by the late Washington Ryer, but
this is so tied up with litigation that it is
not available.

refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and â  rains.
"Lows" ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In the Interior

north and south alon; the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of

M V fVRK. N. V.. Dec. 30.â The only re
deeming feature of speculation at the Sto-k Ex
change to-day was a spurt in American Tobacco
and sugar in tbe Ist? trading. The movements
in these stocks saved the day from being one of
the dullest on record. Fluctuations at the close
of business were merely, nominal, â  covering a
range of only ys'&Vz per . cent outside of a few
stocks. The declaration of the 2 per cent dividend
on Tobacco preferred and 3 per cent on the com
mon stock started up a little speculation In the
latter, although as soon as the stock advanced
rea izaiions seeued to be In order. The real
feature o the .(Jav was the execution of buying
orders for considerable amounts In Sugar during
the last hoirof business, which carried that stock
up fro . i lIUVg to 111!. Manhattan, after selling
uown s/s to orii/g. rose to 89. conso.idated Gas
rose 1. while D.-iauare and Hudson declined 2
percent. The jump in Suzar failed to stimulate
dealings in the prominent railway stocks, such as
the Grangers, Chicago Gas and Louisville and
Nash' i le. and ilios' shares coied with net lasses
of yÂ±(<Lt>/% per cent lor the day. speculation closed

CHICAGO M.YiIKKTS.
â  rniDAOO. in., Dec.' 3o.â While we advanced
-@3c In the price of wheat yesterday, Liverpool
cables this morning gave only %d- improvement
over that price. This indifference caused the crowd
to feel disappointed at the opening and Induced
selling ,of â  rather free proportions. Yesterday's
closing firmness was tberelo:e dtsp.ayed by a tone
of a weaker character accompanied by receding
pries. i The demand from shorts was not so Im
perative and offerings d.d not meet with ready re
sponse. Receipts at Chicago were 52 cars and 54,- |
255 bushels wero withdrawn iromstor*. The 1
Northwest had 227 cars, against :-;7.-f last Wednes
day. Tne correspondine day list year was a holi
day. Closing Liverpool cables contributed further
to the depression, a decline of id from the opening
being given. Cli sing Continental cables were lr
reguiar, displaying very little strength. Export
clearances were 251,429 bushels. May wheat
opened from Kji/uc to ts3";io, declined to S-V2C,
Closing at 82%Â®83c, lc under yesterday. ICstl
mated receipts ior to-morrow 13 cars. No. 2, red,
spot wheat ranged from 90^c to 93Vs c closing at
about 90 %5592 c.
CORNâ No I developments of unusual kind were
noted in the corn market. A Mow dragging trade,
with prices moving upward or downward in nar
row fractions as. the wheat market displayed
strength or weakness, - toot place. Liverpool [
cables quoted I4d advance at that place. Re
ceipts Â« ere 268 cars and 5000 busuels were taken !
from store. Exports amounted to 541,935 bushels, i
May corn opened at 257-gc, sold between 25 %@ ;
2tfc and /g @j5 1 /s c, cl. sing at 25% c, 3/gC under !
yesterday. Estimated receipts for tb-mdirow 290 :
cars. ~
OATSâ Were not pa-tlcularly strong nor active. |
The easier feelinc; in wheat had an adverse effect |
on the tone, and those who had accumula Â»d a ;
little oats only an firainess wl.iinply disposed of â 
them to-day. Receipts were 195 cars. There j
\verÂ» no withdrawals from store. Heavy selling 1
by a prominent commission-house intensified the !
weakness iv the last hour. ay oats closed .r;Â«. r ; Â«
of a cent under yesterday. -Estimated receipts for

in the bos market this mornl.-if.'. and it was in turn 1
transmitted to product. Intermittent trading of I
no material impor: constituted the day's business.
There was consider >ble changing from January <

show any essential change. May pork closed

ARTISTIO PARADE STANDS.
Systematic Construction Suggested for
the Inauguration.
The local chapter at ihe National capi
tal of the American Institute of Architects
has suggested a reform in the scheme of
the decoration of the avenue and the erec
tion of reviewing stands for spectators on
the occasion of processions on tne next
inauguration da}'. It has been pointed
out that at previous inaugurations it has
been customary to allow builders and
speculators to erect stands in front of all
the parks and reservations along the line
of march. These stands, instead of being
an attractive feature of the street decora
tions, are merely rough pine structures,
occasionally draped with the cheapest and
flimsiest of flags and bunting, which in
case of rain, look draggled and shabby.
They are erected in such a way and in
snch places as to hide from view all the
parks and statues which are such a feature
of Washington. This practice not only
gives to visitors a false impression of the
capital city, but results in some cases in
injury to the reservation and to the
statues therein. It is now proposed by tne
architects to abolish the privilege of erect
ing stands in front of parks and reserva
tions. In lieu of these they would have
stands erected in the cross streets that in
tersect the line of march. These stands
are to run either from building line to
building line on the side streets or from
curb to curb, as may seem the most de
sirable. They would extend to the build
ing line on tne street along which the pa
rade passes, but not beyond it, so as to
offer no obstruction to the crowds along
the pavements. The stands are to be
raised above tb.e street, so that ordinary
traffic can pass under them without hin
drance.

With modest ceremony a little woman
who possessed an interest in one of the
wealthiest of the old Scotch estates, was
buried this afternoon from an unassuming
little house in West Oaklr.nd.
Mrs. Murgaret Booth has lived in this
city for many years and her life history is
more romantic and tragic than any relia-

ble creator of fiction dare place in print.
Until forced to apply to the Supervisors for
help the little woman lived on the sale
of heirlooms. One by one they were sold
for bread and butter aud among her pa
trons were the wealthiest ladies in Oak
land.
i In a little tin case in her room were
' f and some documents, one of wuich is
Ikinore than a century old and which
clearly establishes her descent from one
of the noble3t of the Scottish families of
the last century. The old document is a
unique certificate issued to her errand
lather, Baron Ross, ou April 3, 1796. by
;-;. Mungo's Lodge of Masonry at Glas
gow, Scotland. The document' is sealed
over a ribbon that was blue 100 years ago,
but with the exception of one little spot,
is now yellow. All the ornamental work,
and there is a preat deal of it on the
parchment, was done by hand, and tne
coloring is well preserved. It recom
mends John Ross to the good will of Ma
â onsall around tne globe, and is signed

Th-^ deceased was the daughter of Sir
James Morr.pornery, who was a member
of the Grand Masonic Lodge of Ireland.
In the tin case referred to a clearance cer
tificate was found which was granted him
on April t>, I*l2. Another relic iound in
the old Viscountess' rooms is an ancient
punchbowl that came into the possession
of the family in Scotland in 1772 and has
been given ;o successive brides in the fam
ily ever since. It is richly ornamented
with Masonic characters.
Mrs- Booth, prior to her death, told a
story regarding her daughter, which
chows how one unfiHal act can wreck the
happiness of a lifetime. In early life Mrs.
Booth had more than her sliare of deep
trouble. A baby 18 months old was pois
oned by a drunken doctor, a ad 10 years
of age was drowned in a lake near tli-ir
liom* in Sierra County, another son was
stabbed to death by Italians, and yet an
other expired after one day's illness while
employed as a clerk at the Oakland City
Hall. In addition to this, Mrs. Booth
was left a widow many years ago. Sbe
was about to wed a second husband, when
her daughter interfered. Her intended
departed on a long trip, on his return
from which he was to have been married.
Her daughter did not approve of the
match, and, according to her mother's
story, she intercepted letters tnat came
from him and kept them from hermother.
Not for years afterward did Mrs. Booth
discover how she had been treated. Up
to the day of her death she still looked
forward to a reunion witti her lost lover
but for many years she bad not heard a
word of him.
Although partially dependent on the
county during the last monih of her life
Mrs. Booth was not buried in a pauner's
grave. Friends took the funeral in hand
and the remains of the unhappy woman
whose life, but for one act, might have
been so different, were quietly interred in
a private grave at MouutainView Ceme

BURNED THE SWITCHBOARD
Freaks of Lightning in the Hayward
Telephone Officeâ The Operator
Mi ncked
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 30.â An electrrc
Â«torm of Â»bort duration passed over Ala
meda County this Â«venins. About 5
o'clock there was one brilliant flash of
lightning immediately succeeded by a loud
lieal of thunder.
About a mile to the westward of Hay
wards the lightning struck the telephone
wires and the remarkable sight was pre
sented of a sheet of flame suspended be
tween the poles. It hung there.for sev
eral minutes and presented a weird sight
againet the 'lark background of the sty.
The electric fluid traveled alone the wire
toward Hay waids and comrnuni(Â»tad the
ktire to the switchboard where the operator,
Nora O'Brien, was sitting.
Suddenly the telephone office was bril
iintly illuminated, but it was only ior
an instant, us me appliances providing for
such emergency quickly receivea the cur
reniand prevented a conflagration.
Of the tli ir teen wires leadiug to the
Haywards central office, twelve were de
stroyed and six wires connecting with the
8 oekton current were also burned. Miss
O'Brien had her hand on the switchboard i
at the moment the lightning came, but
she was not seriously shocked, although
It is nothing sbort of miracul.ius that she
was not bailly burned.
â¢I cannot describe it," said Miss O'Brien
to-night, "for it took place so very sud
denly. 1 felt a slight shock and instantly
lLlitnin.' seemed to be dancing about all
over the switchboard. There was a smell
of burning, but tne non-conductors shut
oft the current the instant it reached
them."
The telephone office where the light
ning struck is about a block and a half
from where lightning strtick and destroyed
the electric light plant a year ago. At
that time the electric fluid was carried
into the dynamos over th* wires and tiie
largest of them exploded with, a report
like thunder.
Peorle residine in that neighborhood
no longer believe in the aphorism that
lightning never strikes twice in tbe same
place.

DENOUNCES THEM
AS "NEFARIOUS"
So Are the Liquor Ads in
the "Blue and
Gold." /
W. W. Bristol of the College
Y. M. C. A. Assails Man
ager Mott.
la a Curt Letter He Says He Will
Fight the Liquor Question to
the End.
BERKELEY. Cal., Dec. 30.â The fight
between the I'oung Men's Christian Asso
ciation of the State University and the
management of Ihe Bluo and Gold over
the publication of liquor advertisements
in the Annual is waxing hot.
W. W. Bristol, manager of the Students'
Aid Society ana one of the most promi
nent members of the college Y. M. C. A.,
wrote a very curt letter to Manager Mott
of the Blue and Gold to-day, in which he
scores the latter for not heeding the re
cent resolutions passed by the Cnristian
Association protesting against the publi
cation of such rdvertisemercts in the Blue
and Gold. He says that the request the to
manager was not done in a spirit of child's
play, but that the Y. M. C. A. meant busi
ness when they drafted the resolutions.
Being one of the framers of the injunc
tion, Bristol has been free to express his
opinion and has couched his letter in no
uncertain language.
The renewed controversy was precipi
tated by the publication in this morning's
Call of the statement made by Manager
Mott that he would keep out the liquor
ads if the Y. M. C. A. would make cood
the financial loss thus brought upon the
book.
In an interview this evening, Bristol
made the following statement for publi
cation:
Yes, I read the notice in The Call th is
morninc relative to the liquor "ads" in the
Blue Hud Goid, and as trie author of the reso
lutions protesting in the name of the college
Young Men's Christian Association agaias-t
such "ads," 1 think 1 have something 10 say.
When we asked the management of the
Blue and Gold 10 refuse liquor "ads" It was
not done in the spirit 01 cnlld's play. We
meant business. We fight along these
lines until we accomplish our purpose, be
cause our opinion has become a conviction
that we are right. In the interest of purity,
propriety and consistency we have made our
demand.
The time has come when Christian men at
least must hedge about the liquor trafhc in
every conceivable way. The State, the faculty
and the students unite in banishing the sale
of liquor one mile from the university campus,
yet tee most widely circulated student publi
cation of the University of California hesi
tates not to devote its pages to the advertising
of liquor not only by printed words, but by
ou s, in which lurk suggestions of degrading
sensuality.
Mr. Mott did suggest that we guarantee him
the amount the "Â«ds" would come to. Presi
dent Fair-child and I talked this over and the
proposition was rejected on the ground that
as an association standing for all that is pure
and ennobling in the college i: was our prov
ince 10 persuade rather than to purchase men
to do the right, but that as individuals the as
sociation would see to it that the mÂ«nage
raent lost nothine by rejecting saloon "ads."
Mr. Mott then persuaded us to let the matter
drop, assuring us turn he would do all in his
power to keep out said "ads." With this we
allowed the matter to rest. I believe the sen
timent of the class of '98 is decidedly opposed
to the insertion of saloon "ads," and 11 this
sentiment is aroused it can do ihe Blue and
Gold more harm financially than the nelarious
traffic "ads" can do good.
Ou the other hand 1 believe this sentiment
is strong enough to make good ihe financial
help the liquor "ads" would give, and I
think there are around the bay firms of a
legitimate character sufficient to flood the
"B. and G." with "ads" rather than tha; its
pages should be polluted with questionable
advertisements. I have to-day written Mr.
Mott these views.
There is no telling when nor where the
fieht will end. An attempt to bring the
matter before the class in an official man
ner was made last term, but without avail.
Most of the classmen seem to treat the
matter with indifference, and appear will
ing to let the manager use his own discre
tion as to what shou d be published and
what should not On tne other hand, the
Y. M. C. A. members, who represent not
an inconsiderable number of the class,
seem determined to fight the matter to the
bitter end. In tiieir resolutions they say
that their "sense of right and consistency
as Christian men has been shocked to the
utmost through the insertion in times
past on the pages of Blue ana Gold of the
advertising matter of liquor-dealers."
In their denunciatory billet they refer
to cuts of liquor-houses, which appeared
in the annual, and to the licentious influ
ence which they exert.
In '97's "B. ana G." there appeared n
full page half-tone engraving of the bar in
a well-known San Francisco resort.
The thoughts of this and other similar
ads are rankling in the breasts of tne
Christian Association members, and they
nave apparently put on full armor and

PAYNE SCORES ROBBINS.
A Berkeley Unitarian mid Congrega
tionalist at Outsâ Reply and
Rrjoinder.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 30.â The Rev.
E. B. Payne, late of the Berkeley Unita
rian Church, aud the Rev. J. Clarke Rob
bins of the North Berkeley Congregational
Church, have engaged their pens and
tongues in a bitter controversy over the
former's farewell sermon of last Sunday.
Mr. Robbins declared that the sermon
was a gloomy lamentation voicing tbe Uni
tarian's disappointment at life and his
failure to find peace and satisfaction in
his doctrines. "The sermon is .1 warning
to all young men," declared theCongrega
tionalist.
To-day Mr. Payne replied with a bitter
attack upon orthodoxy, as represented by
Mr. Robbins, and denning ti is own posi
tioa as a searcher after truth.
"I have not lound all the truth 1 ex
pected to find or shall yet rind," said Mr.
Payne, "and I am not so sure of what I
have as are some loud dogmatists whose
petty traditional systemsÂ»were found for
them long ago by somebody else."
As to astrology Mr. Payne said: "I
feel only contempt for the sort of ortho
doxy that judges things by the amount of
'peace anu satisfaction' they afford, for
peace and satisfaction are not what ra
tional, manly souls are after, but truth
and reality.
"Mr. Rabbins' 'warning to young men'
is nothing but a warning to them to ab
stain from honest search for truth in order
to be more happy by being saved by the
old, regular orthodox and warranted pro
cess."
To-night the Rev. Mr. Robbins had the
MAUD QUACKENBUSH, Whose Elopement Was Nipped in the
Bod by Mrs. Prescott of the Children's Society.
following to say regarding the much-dis
cussed farewell sermon and Mr. Payne's
attitude:
As to the warninp to all young men, Mr.
Payne gives us the material whereby vee can
picture the young man of about 28 years
starting to his new field of labor lull of the
loitiest aspirations, hope and spirit of in
trepidity; he was going in response to a call
"for a pastor of earnest convict ons, firm the
ology and evangelistic temperament," but in
less than four years he failed in all these re
quirements; bis friends at OberUn had be
lieved that he possessed them to an uncommon
degree; he undoubtedly believed so himself,
else he was dishonest, yet he failed; it is a
warning to all young men.
Again Mr. Pajne saps the powerful influence
of the university led him from orthodoxy to
UnitarianlÃra; that tbe influences antagonis
tic to the old faith such as were not encoun
tered in the orthodox home led him to throw
away the old faith. This is a waruing to all
young men who come to Berkeley.
Aeain he "says of the acceptance of that call
to Berkeley in 1874: "I looked upon it as a
settlement to a life work, but events turned
out differently." What does this mean if it is
not an admisslen of failure as to his life work?
I will admit that such an admission may not
have been a sad one. Still the general tone of
the sermon is downcast in spirit not from the
weight of the present, alone but also of the
pnst, possibly of the future.
Again Mr. Payne say 3: "I was once a theo
logian, but 1 am free to confess that I am not a
theologian to-day." Whence .this change?
Has he not said that it was due to the power
ful influence of the State University? He
came here as the valiant champion ot ortho
doxy, and in less than four years he was be
ginning to oppose it. Abortion is failure.

Young Mr. Williams Is Still Single

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Dec. 30. j
A cleverly planned elopement was ef
fectively nipped in the bud by Mrs. Pres
cott, secretary of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Children, three
niehts ago. As tne result of her strategy
the young man in the case left for the
East last Sunday night, while the young
lady did not get away till last nignt.
Miss Maud ljuackenbusn is the 16-year
old daughter of a divorced Berkeley con
tractor. Some time ago her father ar
ranged for her to have the matronly care
that is to be found at the Chabot Home,
and the young lady was placed in charge
of Mrs. Glud, who was in charge of that
institution. All was going well, when the
matron met with a severe accident about
three months ago, the effect of which has
been to confine her to her home ever
since.
Miss Maud is a very clever little girl.
â Naturally pretty, with fair hair and an
innocent unassuming manner, she was
enabled to somewhat deceive Mrs. Glud's
successor. By various pretexts she man-
Hired to take quite a number of trips into
Oakland witbout exciting any suspicion.
Finally it came to the matron's ears that
her waid was having clandestine meetings
With a young man named Williams. The
young lady confessed her reeard for Wil
liams and hinted that if she were es
tranged that they might take matters into
their own hands.
As a last resort it was decided to send
the girl to her mother who lives in Chi
caeo. She was informed of the contem
plated plan, and at once made arrange
ments with her lover to frustrate it. It
was agreed between tht>m that he should
go E:ist on the same train and that they
should get off at some way station and ba
married. Girl-like she took one or two
intimate friends into her confidence, and
before the day set for her departure ar
rived the matron of the Chabot Home and
Mrs. Prescott were informed of the plans.
Mrs. Prescott took Miss Quackenbush to
her home and carefully guarded her so
that she could not make her escape and
get away on the same train with young
Williams. Monday night Williams got
on board the eastbound train, but Miss
Maud did not. She was kept at Mrs.
Prescott's house till last night, when she
was taken to the train and placed aboard,
and when she arrives at Chicago she will
be met by her mother. Miss Maud is evi
dently not an expert at deception, for she
left at the Chabot Home a note from her
lover in which all their plans were out
lined, and had she not told any one of ncr
intended elopement the letter itself would
have frustrated her plans. When told
last night thit she was going to leave for
Chicago within an hour she was greatly
surprised, for she was not aware when she
was to leave, being purposely kept in ig
norance so that sne could not make any
more arrangements with her youtnfui
iover. _____________

Gun*.
OAKLAND, Cal., Dec. 30.â The mystery
regarding the remains of the man found
at the mole yesterday has been cleared uu.
John Conlan was not shot before he was
run over by the train.
The holes in his face were made by two
boys named Eddie Dolan and Elma Me-
Bride, both of Willow street, who used an
air gun on the piece of the man's face not
knowing that it was part of Conlan. They
told trieir s;ory to Detectives Shorey and
Holland to-day, and the buckshot used by
them in similar to that found in the man's
lace.
The dead man's relatives assert that be
was not intoxicated when he was killed,
but thai he frequently indulged in liquor
quite freely.

verdict by the jury of accidental death.
Engineer Robert Aiken of the Alameda
local train testified that Conlon must have

THE WATSON CASE.
No Occasion for Dragging the Rev.
Dr. Scudder's Name Into a
"Sensation."
OAKLAND, Cal, Dec. 30.â Much indig
nation is expressed at the manner in which
the name of tha Rev. AV.W. Scudder, D.D.,
was used in to-day's report of a very ordi
nary divorce case. Dr. Scudder's name
was brought into the case in a very casual
way, and the testimony of every divorce
case tried in open court can he made to
furnish just such a "sensation." The
facts of the case are to be found in to-day's
Call.
Mr. Scudder was seen in his study in
the First Congregational Church, Ala
meda, to-night by a Call representative,
but refused to make any answer to the ar
ticle. "I have nothing to say," said the
gentleman, and no amount of persuasion
would draw another word from him.
Deacon Ager was more inclined to talk
when seen at prayer-meeting. '"I see no
cause for Mr. Scudder being abused. The
paper has so much space to rill, I suppose
it must run something. Ido not take it
Â«nd have no use for such sensationalism.
The Call is my paper, and I consider it

BERKELEY POLITICS.
Excitement Over Testimony in Court
That Town Marshal Lloyd Was
. Intoxicated.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec. 30.â Marshal
Lloyd declares that politics is responsible
for the testimony in court yesterday that
he was intoxicated while making the ar
rest of P. A. Unda, who was charged
with keeping his saloon open after mid
night. A town election will be held in
Berkeley in a few months, and the friends
of â â¢; Lloyd assert that â¢an i effort ; is being
made to spoil his chances for re-election.
On the other hand, Unda and two other
witnesses swore in court that the Marshal
was under the influence of liquor. , Lloyd
admitted to having bad a number of
drinks, and the affair has attracted much
attention, .especially, among those who
had begun to watch the political pot.
; According to the testimony Lloyd en
tered ; Unda's place .and : took several
drinks of whisky, and at the time he made
the charge against " Unda was in a most
befuddled state. : Lloyd denies all i. this,
and those who were with him shortly be

CHURCH DISCUSSIONS.
The Church of the Nazarene and Trini y
Methodist ChurchâDiscord in
the Latter.
BERKELEY, Cal., Dec, 30 âMembers
of Trinity Methodist Church are again
discussing a possible split, growing out of
the same revival band's actions that has
caused trouble in the past. On recent
Sunday evenings several members of the
holiness band, who do not approve of
some of the regular church policies, have
held servicies in the auditorium down
stairs whil- the usual evening service and
sermon were going on above. The sing
ing penetrated to the upper auditorium
and a good deal of indignation was
aroused.
Tne holiness band is expected to furnish
most of the recruits for the new Church of
the Nazarene which will be organized in
Berkeley next'month. Dr. Bressee of Los
Angele-, the original founler ol the
church, will vi?it Berkeley to assist irvtlie
organization. E. A. G;rvin is the leader
of the local movement for the Nazarene
Church.

particular, a" perfect piece of appar
atus. It is not intended, as a rule,
to give in this "column descriptions
of American devices or achievements
drawn from foreign publications. This
subject has, however, .. been taken up by
the Enplish journal. Industries and Iron,
and although it states j that an American
process for renewing these lamps afier the
lilament has been ; broken,' has been de
veloped, it does not give the name of in
ventors nor state that the process has
come into anything like general applica
tion. Its dcsciiption of the operation is,
therefore, given; for what , it is worth. It
states that a commercial success has been
made of a process for !- renewing burned
out lamps â  which renders possible the
use of the old bulb at a very slight ex
pense. By the new method the collar or
bare end of the lamp is not disturbed, the
old filament being removed and the new
one placed through a small hole in the
lamp bulb made by removing the tip.
The small hole is subsequently closed
exactly in the same manner as in the case
of the new lamp, leaving nothing to
indicate in the finished repaired lamp that
it had ever been opened. It is stated that
some 400,000 lamps have been repaired by
this method, the filament being inserted
through the small hole referred to by a
skillful twist of the hand and secured in
position by a special carbon paste. Tbe
black deposit on the inside of the bulb is
removed by fitting the lamp to the holder
and removing it in a gas furnace; while
immediately following this operation a
small glass tube is fused to the opening
made in the bulb, through which the
lamp is exhausted. When this has been
done and the last trace of air and gas ab
sorbed, a blow-pipe flame is directed upon
the throat of the tube, whicn is melted
into the point exactly in every respect a
counterpart of the original lamp. â Provi

CHANCED THE
HOVERING STORM
Hundreds of Ladies Viewed
the. Races at Ingle
side.
The Handicap Captured in Rol
licking Fashion by Red
Glenn.
Schiller Scored Easilyâ Walter J
8.-aten in a Hard Drive by Salva
blcâEstaca First at Good Odds. .
The prospect of being overtaken by the |
approaching storm and returning home
with drooping feathers and soiled finery
did not prevent hnndreds of the fair sex
from taking advantage of "ladies' day" at j
lngieside. The elements were kind
enough to withhold the liquid downpour
until everybody was well on their way
home, and an excellent card of six well
tilled events were run off to the perfect
satisfaction of the big crowd. Favorites
were in winning fettle again and scam
pered away with four of the six races de
cided.
The racing was of high caliber and no
complaint was heard of any "dead ones"
parading for the benefit of. unscrupulous
layers of odds. The fat purses hung up
are an incentive for owners to go out and
win.
The riding honors were divided be
tween Slauehter, H. Martin, Eddie Jones, j
Maynard, Willie Martin and Tony Grit- j
lin's green 'un, httie Barringer.
The $500 handicap over one and a six
teenth miles was the main feature of the I
day. Tdere were six acceptances of the
weights allotted. In the betting there
was no pronounced choice, quite a tribute
to the handicanper's cunning. At post
time Ed Purser's pair, Red Glenn and |
Yankee Doodle, ridden respectively by
Jones and Doggett, had a slight call" over
Hermanita, the ring laying threes against
the duo of bays. CabrilJo, Wawona and
Adolph Spreckels were all well played at a
trifle ionger price.
When sent away Yankee Doodle started I
out to make the running, but he soon |
gave up the lead to his stable companion,
who relished the soft going as a
duck does water, and retaining his advan- !
tage to the c.d romped in three lengths
fefo.-e Hermanita. Opposite the paddock
it looked as though CabrilJo, who had 1
been running in second Position, would j
take place honors, but the last jump or '
two he was nosed out by Follansbee's
mare. The winner covered the distance i
in 1:54.
Barney Schreiber's good colt Schiller
again made sport of his company in the i
opening luiieuash. He was backed from i
1 to 2 to 7 to 20 and galloped in ahead of
Eari Cochran, asoto 1 shot. The Spreck- I
ela entry, Wyoming, was a good third.
Instailator made no showing whatever.
Ine gray colt Greyhurst gave followers
of 'h* favorite a severe setback over t c
resuit of the second race at seven furlongs. '<
Oppo-ed to him were seven very fair two- j
year-olds, yet 11 to 20 was about the best i
price laid. Esiaca, the Baldwin entry, I
was said to be a "comer," and the wise j
ones backed him at odds of 8 and 9 to 1. i
J les on the favorite, closely accompanied !
by Horatio, set a merry clipto the stretch, j
where both began displaying distress sic- i
nnls and were closed on by Arrezzo on the '
outside and Estaca, on which "Skeets" i
Martin took a short cut. It dwindled I
down to a duel between the Baldwin colt
and Arrezzo, and the Santa Anita bred
youngster gained the decision by half a
length. Greyhurst was a tired third.
A very ordinary lot of maiden jumpers
lined up in the mile and a sixteenth hur- I
die affair, and backed down irom 8 to 5 to j
evens, Snowdown with Maynard up led
all the way, and won handily from Bril
liant, a2sto 1 shot Brca i Billow backed I
from 12 to 2%, finished outside of the coin, '
being beaten for the show by Fred Gard
ner.
The fifth event at six and a half fur
longj developed itself down to a two
horse race between Pat Dunne's Salvabte,
the 8 to 5 favorite, with Wiilie Mnrtin in
the saddle, and the unlucky Walter J,
with Slaughter up. Walter J was in re
ceipt of ten pounds, and it took all of
Martin's saddle ability to land the first
choice winner. Saivable led into the
stretch half a length before Walter, and
they had it ding-dong to the wire. Mar

Notes.
The California Oaks for three-year-old
fillies, over a mile and a furlong, the rich
est stake yet run this season, is the feature
of the card at Inelestde this afternoon.
Torsina, Argentina, Sweet Faverdale and
Summertime should furnish a grand
race, for each is a rare good one. Tne
gross value of the stake is $2500.
Twenty-one bookmakers cut in yester
day.
The judges fined H. Brown $50 for his in
different riding of St. Aignon, one of the
starters in the first race.
Young Slaughter will also, in all prob
ability, have a fine to settle. Barney
Sohreiber's lightweight had the mount on
Adolph Spreckels, which horse started in
tue handicap, and was requested by the
animal's owner, E. Corngan, not to un
necessarily punish the colt if be saw that
his chances of finishing in the money
were hopeless. On the contrary, Mr. Cor
rigan reported to the stand that the lad
raised bit; welts on the colt as though he
imagined himself astride a "lobster."
Cuptain Rees said that he would probably
fine Slaughter $100.

DUNBAR CONVICTED.
The Fraudulent Agent of the Pies*
Club to Be Sentenced To-Day.
Alexander Dunbar Jr. was yesterday
convicted by Judge Low of obtaining
money by false pretenses, and was or
dered into custody to appear for sentence
to- :ay.
Dunbar, it was proved, collected various
sums of money from prominent citizens
by representing himself as an agent of
the Press Club at the time the club was
arranging its annual benefit. Tne par
ticular offense for which he was tried wms
the obtaining of $25 from President BecKer
of the German Savings Bank.
This was not the first time Dunbar had
fi.ured in swindling schemes. Three
years ago, while in Honolulu, he posed as
the proprietor of a business directory en
terprise and secured money from mer
chants and others for advertisements, but
the directory was never published. After
his arrival here he started several direc
tories for^ the use of Chinese merchants
throughout the State and worked the
same scheme as he did in Honolulu.
BUTTE'S RED GIANT.
Captain Hooper, a Powerful New
Recruit, Has Arrived
From Montana.
Both Elevens Working for To-Mor
row's Matchâ Leagua of the Cross
to Play Also.
The Butte football team is not only
determined to defeat the Olympic men
again, but is taking every precaution to
insure a decisive victory in the game to be
played at Central Park to-morrow after
noon, rain or shin*.
Yesterday the biggest giant of Butte, the
tall red-haired Jim Hooper, arrived from
Montana, where he had been compelled to
remain behind on account of sn attack of
rheumatism, from whicn he has not yet
entirely recovered. He is the captain of
the all-conquering eleven from the greatest
mining camp on earth and is at the same
time, because of his long experience and
his superior weight, the particular tower
of strength in the Butte line. He and the
giant Hall, bothatiired in their old Michi
gan varsity sweaters of blue with a great
yellow M on tLe breast, form a most pic
turesque pair of guards. Each is over 6
Jeet 3 inches in height and broad shoul
dered, and most women would describe
them as handsome. Hall weighs 212
pounds with his c.othes on and has long,
bushy, very light yellowish hair, while
Hooper w jighs about L'3o pounds in ordin
ary dress and has a remarkable and lux
uriant head-covering of the most Homing
red hair.
They are probably the most striking
looking pair of giant athletes ever seen on
a Western endiron field.
Yesterday alternoon the whole Butte
aggregation was practicing at Central
Park. Tne team has been workin every
day in preparation for its final effort in
California to-morrow.
Its record Â» a series of overwhelming
victories, as is shown by the following list
of all the games that Butte arranged to
play this season.
Omaha University Clnb 20â0
Doane Col Â»-ge, Nebraska 22â 0
Neur sea C'ily Athletic Association 'I'iâ 4 i

Olympic (Christmas day) 18-0
Olympic (New Year's day)
Portland Athletic Club
And Butte plays good football. It is not
a particularly tricky game nor do all the
men get into the plays, but it has a quick,
snappy style of rushing that delignts the
spectators and almost demoralizes an op
posing team.
Olympic will put a reconstructed team
in the field to-morrow. It will include
many of the men that forced Butte on
Christmas, but several changes are to be
made, looking to the formation of more
reliable defensive play and the introduc
tion of hard line bucking backs to offset
these of the Butte team.
Weldon, the old Stanford sub-fullback,
will likely De put in at fu Iback for Olym
pic ->ot to kick but to buck the line and
toci'feb puntÂ«, in both of which styles of
play he is good. Then Seartght, the Stan
ford varsity half who lost ground repeat
edly when given the ball in the Christ
mas game, will probably be moved to end
because of his speed and excellent defen
sive. He played end in Missouri last year
before entering Stanford. Stickney and
Morse will be the halves for Olympic.
Otherwise the Christmas-day line-up will
be repeated.
Some of the Olympic players have hopes
of holding Butte down to a score of 6âo,
with a possibility of a tie. Other of the
clubmen shake their heads, and declare
that Butte can beat anything on this coast.
As Butte was practicing at Central Park
three other teams were also on the field,
going through their different plays. One
was a juvenile team, the Young Bohe
mians, disappointed at the non-appear
ance of the Lincoln Grammar School team
with which a game was to have been
played.
The Young Bohemians, captained by
Richet of St. Mary's Colle^e.ana averaging
in weight about 135 pouuds to the player,
are to meet the Polytechnic High School
eleven at Central Park on Saturday fore
noon. The other teams at Central Park
yesterday were the little Y. M. C. A. light
weight champions and the University
Club eleven that is to meet the Army and
Navy team on January 9. These teams, in
spite of the evident great difference Jn
weight, faced each other in a practice
game, in which honors were about even,
though superior playing was shown on the
aide of the lightweight champions, who
have never been defeated during all the
three years they have played as a team.
The University Club has quite an aggre
gation of men who have played football in
years gone by, but in individual ability
and in recent familiarity with the game,
they are heavily handicapped by the ath
letes of the Army and Navy, most of
whom played at West Point or Annapolis
last reason.
To-morrow forenoon the principal foot
ball match of the year among the cham
pions of the League of the Cross will be
played at the Presidic grounds. Company
A and B, the best matched and greatest
rivals, will oppose each other. In every
previous contest of these two companies
the result has been a tie.
The Railroad Appeals.
The ca*e of Mrs. B. A. Null add her daughter,
Eva A. Null (an infant), against the Great
Northern Railway, has been appealed to the
United States Circuit Court c-f Appeals In
September, 1894, John A. Nu.l, tne husband
and lather of the complainants, was a conduc
tor on a freight train on the defendant's road
He was killed by strlkin? against a bridge at
Malta, and the widow sued the company far
Â£20,000 damages. She received judgment for
$10 000, and it is from this decision that the
railroad company now appeals.

Sixteen grocers of this City are to be ar
rested within the next few days for vio
lating the laws prohibiting the sale of
adulterated foodstuffs.
At the meeting of the Board of Health
yesterday the chemist presented the fol
lowing report:
I have carefully analyzed twenty-three
samples of tomato catsup. T'renty-one oj
these were found to have been adulterated
with salicylic acid, and two with boracic hckl.
Twelve were artificially colored with coal < il
colors. Assuming that tomato catsup should
contain on the average 80 per cent of water
and 20 per cent of solids, including the nsh,
only six samples would come up to the stand
ard.
The samples found to be adnltered were
purchased at the following groceries:
W. B. Cluff, 17 Sixth street; Smith's Cash
Store, Market street; William Cline, 949 Mar

The chief food inspector of the board
was instructed to swear out warrants for
ail of those who had sold the adulterated
goods.
The reports of cholera at Hongkong and
Shanghai were taken up nnd discussed,
and the following resolution passed on
motion of Dr. Williamson:
Sesolred, That the ports of Shanghai and
Hongko..g are hereby declared infected, and
that the quarantine officer be and hereby is
directed to remand all steerage passengers
and baggage, and also ;he mails from these
ports, to the United states quarantine author
ities at Angei Island for disinfection.
The secretary is hereby instructed to for
ward a copy of this resolntlon to the Collector
of Cusioms oi this port, to the Postmaster and
to the United States and local quarantine of
ficers.
Paul Edwards was appoinntod to the
position of steward of the City and County
H spital, vice William Kobinson, re
signed.
It was decided to take up the chirges
against the chief Food and Milk Inspec
tor, which were thrown out of court by
Judge Heobard, and hold an investiga
tion. The testimony in the matter will be
heard in special session on Wednesday
next.
The Hospital Committee rendered a re
port on the condition of the City and
County Hospital and the efforts that have
been made to :n<luce the Supervisors to
place the building in repair.
Alter reviewing much of what has al
ready been said arid written of the sani
tary condition of the institution, the re
port concludes:
We further trust that when this report be
comes a matter of public information some of
the reprcsen alive citizens who pretend to
have the interests of ih^s City at heart but
who are continually bewailing the possible
addition to their annual tax bills oi an insig
nificant fraction of a mill on the dollar will
take the lime and the trouble to visit and in
spect the indecent exhibition and flagrant
riumonstration of the niggardly manner in
which the government oi San Francisco pro
vides for the care of the Indigent sick, an<l
that once having seen and appreciated the
pitiable condition which we have feebly at
tempted to describe they will never have the
temerity to deny that the opprobrium which
has so tenaciously attached itself to this timo
bonored, misshapen and misconducted muui
cipal monsirosity is no: tne result ot a neglect
on the part of the health authorities, but is
simply and entirely due to the faulty system
oi civic administration which takes from the
hands oi your board the power to direct the
proper disposition oi funds placed to your
credit for use in the Health Department.
Dr. Williamson said, after the report
was adopted and the secretary ordered to
send a copy to the Supervisors, that if no
attention was paid to it it would be proper
to abandon the hospital.
TO RAISE WINE VALUES,
The Fight for Trade in New
Orleans Has Proved
Dsastrous.
The Big Cut in Prices Has Brought
the Lusiness Where Tfcere's
Nothing in It.
A meeting of the California Wine
growers' Corporation has been called, to
be held this week, to take some action
with regard to the slash in prices that has
been going on in New Orleans for the past
several weeks. The break in prices has
been such that winemen in the New Or
leans market are declared to be losing
money. The prica agreed upon by the
corporation and which stood for four
months, leaving something of a profit,
was 26 nnd 27 cents. Competition and
secret underselling began and continued
for some time, ana the stable market be
gan to rock.
It was charged that members of the
Growers' Corporation were among the
first at fault in breaking from the agreed
price. Finally the California Wine Asso
ciation declared tiutly a rate of 22 cents.
This was 2 cents lower than it ftad been
previous to the establishment of the price
by the agreement of the corporation at 26
cents, and since then the tendency has
been downward. The latest quotation is
19 cents. Hence the calling oi the meet
ing to discuss some p an of re establishing
a better price on a stronger basis.
P. C. Rossi of tne Italian-Swiss Colony,
large growers and dealers, speaking of the
matter, said:
"All the leading firms in this City, such
as Gundlach & Bundchu, Lichman &
Jacobi, the Italian-Swiss Colony, Cheva
lier and others, have agencies in New Or
leans. For a long time the price of 26
cents a gallon was maintained there, but
recently home parties, appreciating the
fact that merchants of New Orleans pay
cash promptly tor all goods purchased,
hit upon tii idea of dickering for credit
in California and selling for cash in the
Crescent City. They succeeded by going
from grower to crower and from dealer to
dealer in getting a long credit, and imme
diately began to undersell the agencies of
the California Wine-growers' Association
in the New Orleans market. The associa
tion authorized its agents there to make
such concessions as were necessary to
hold the trade. The price consequently
dropped from 26 to 22 cents, and mer
chants, perceiving the downward tend
ency, censed purchasing, believing that
prices would go still lower."
The cut has not gone beyond New Or
leans. Prices are maintained in St. Louis,
Cincinnati, Chicago and Mew York.
Leading wjn--growers assert that the
fixed price of 20 cents in California is low
enough, and ttiat any figure below that
rate would be less than a small profit on
the cost of production.
Letters have been received from agents
of the association in New Orleans, wherein
it is said that merchants are not buying,
but holding out for a further decline.
There is some apprehension that large
dealers in San Francisco may deem it ex
pedient to swinsr away from association
prices and sell at reduced fisures.
New Orleans is a big market for Cali
fornia wines, and is therefore a seat of
constant warfare among the merchants.
The wine sold there is the cheapest grade
of claretâ all claret. Something over
4,000,000 gallons are sold there annually.
It is thought that some means will be
found to re-establish a better price at the
called meeting of the corporation.
New Year's Day for Young Men.
An extensive programme has been arranged
for the entertainment of members and friends

Building to-morrow, and the following will be

BIG LEGAL FEES

Pruning Knife.
In the estate of James G. Fair, deceased,
Judge Slack yesterday handed down an
opinion in the matter of the application j
by the special administrators for compen- I
sation for themselves and for their attor
neys.
They are allowed $2500 each for addi
tional compensation, instead of $23,375
each for such compensation.
It will be remembered that about two j
weeks ago tbe special odministrators and
their attorneys requestea Judge Slack, be
fore whom the Fair estate litigation is j
heard, to fix the amount of their compen- ]
sation. The facts involved in the matter
are fully presented in the court's opinion,
of which the following is the full text:
The matter of fixing the compensation of
the special administrators and of determining
the allowance to be made to them for the fees
of their attorneys was reserved for future con- i
sideration when the final accounts of the spe
cial administrators were in other respects set
tled. The special administration, through no
fault of the administrators, hns lasted from Jan- i
vary 2, 1895, to November 10, 1890, a period j
of twenty-two and a half months. Louis ('. I
Bresse. one of the four persons appointed ad- J
ministratons, died on April 22, 1890, since I
which time the three surviving administra- I
tors have managed the estate. The estimated
value of the retl property, bonds, stocks and
other assets, exclusive of the cash on hand,
amounting to $481,330 08. is $12,500,000.
The sum of $4,033,455 39 in cash has passed
through the hands of the administrators, thus
making as the total value of the estate admin
istered upon the sum of $17,133,455 39. Ii
tne statutory commissions of executors and
administrators are to be taken as the standard
for ascertaining the allowance to be made to
the special administrators, as is held (in estate
of Moore, 88 Cal., 1) they may be taken in a
proper case, the total compensation of the ad
ministrators would be $173,500, or, including
Mr. Bresse, $43,375 apiece. It has been sug
gested that this Bum would not be an unrea
sonable allowance under the circumstances,
and ti^at each of the three attorneysâ Mr.
Pierson, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. McEnerney â
should receive the sum of $43,375â the
6um received by each of the administrators â cr
a total off 190,125.
According to tnis method of computation
$303,025, or about $13,500 per mouth, would
be the compensation of the administrators and
the aitorneys.
Each of the three surviving administrators j
hus already received $20,000, Mr. Bresse
$15,000, Messrs. Pierson & Mitchell $20,000 J
and Mr. McEnerney $10,000, or a total of
$105,000â a very large sum in iiself. The
additional amounts asked for are startling in
their proportions, and so at variance with my
ideas as to what ought to be allowed that 1
have thought it advisable to express m,~ views j
In writing, in order that incorrect impressions
about my conception of the worth of the
services rendered may be avoided on the one
side, and in order that the awards to be made
may be justified on the other.
No more vexed duty Is imposed upon the
court than that of fixing the compensation of
attorneys in estates in probate, and the same
is to be said in determining the compensation
of special administrators, there being in
neither instance any definite measure of |
values. It is not an easy thing to be just to
the claimants as well es to the estate, and the
court is frequently not fortunate enough to
satisfy both claimants and distributors. Even
when all parties concerned agree, the court is
compelled to be cautious in the approval of
the agreement lest its action be attempted to
be construed into a mischievous precedent for
other cases not similarly circumstanced, and j
lest a misunderstanding of the conditions i
under which the allowance was made should
subject the court to the criticism of being ex
travagant. In the absence of an agreement,
the observation cf an eminent jurist in Freese
vs. Pennie (110 Cal., 407, 471) should be re
membered:
"Courts have no right to be liberal with the
money of other people, and should be careful
that fees allowed lor trust estates are no larger
than would ba paid for like services by those
â who are competent to contract fcr them
uelves."
I have given the matter in hand much care
ful consideration, with a feel Jug of anxious
ness to do justice to both the claimants and the
estate, and hava renched my conclusions after
mature deliberation.
The services of the administrators have been '
varied and exacting. They have conducted a j
vast business, including ranching, hotel-keep
ing, selling, renting and improving city real
estate, purchasing and disposing of personal
property, managing corporations and collect
ine rents, interest and dividends, all as nearly
according to tbe policy of tbe deceased in his i
lifetime as could be. Their transactions have |
ranged from purchases and sales for a few I
cents up to sales and payments of debts for
millions of dollars. Every cent received and
expended by them has been accounted for
with scrupulous exactness. The estate is
practically out of deb!, and has largely in
creased in value since the death of the de- '
ceased.
. Messrs. Aneus and Bresse were trusted em
ployes of the deceased and thoroughly familiar
with his ttffairs in all of their details. Mr.
Goodfeilow was the attorney of the deceased !
and was conversant with his larger business j
transactions requiring legal advice. They, j
with Mr. Crothers, a nephew, were nominated '
by the deceased iv his will as his executors.
Messrs. Angus end Crothers have devoted
their entire time to the estate, as also did Mr.
Bresse up to the date of his death.
Mr. Goodfellow's time has in part been de

voted to his practice and in part to the busi
ness of the estate, but he has attended to all
matters of importance, and his information
and advice have undoubtedly been of im
portance.
While I fully appreciate the excellent ser
vices rendered I do not think that they are
fairly worth more than $1000 per month for
each of the surviving administrators. This I
consider to be a proper allowance under the
circumstances; but all that should be allowed,
notwithstanding the stipulation of June 6,
1895, by which the three children of tne de
ceased consented that each of the administra
tors should receive at that time $25,000.
The three surviving administrators are con
sequently entitled to a further allowance of
$2500 in addition to the amounts heretofore
allowed them, making altogether for each
$22,500.
According to the same rate the estate of Mr.
Brosstj would be entitled to receive about
$1000. In view of the fact, however, that Mr.
Bresse without doubt worked and worried
himself to his death over the affairs of the
estate, and that the survivors and tile estate
have had the benefit of his extensive informa
tion, I have thought it to be but right to recog
nize his devotion to duty by allowing his
widow and children the same amount as
though he had lived to the end of the special
administration. His estate is therefore en
titled to receive the further sum of $7500.
The allowances heretofore made to the ad
ministrators have exceeded the allowances
made to them for their attorneys. I think
that, under the circumstances, each of the
three attorneys, Messrs. Plerson, Mitchell &
McKnerney, should secure an amount equal
to that granted to each of the administrators,
j but no more. As attorneys for the adminis
trators these three gentlemen have been called
on almost daily to give advice, make applica
tions to the court, prepare documents, or take
some step in the prosecution or defense of the
litigation. The court orders alone which
have been granted, each requiring a formal
| application and a hearing, number 385. Sixty
! suits, counting two proceedings in insolvency,
brought by or against the deceased in his life
time, but not by or against the administrators
I after his death, involving amounts from a few
I dollars up to millions, have required atten
j tion;of these thirty-three have been finally
i determined, two against the deceased have
[ been abandoned by the plaintiffs and three
against him have been ended with his death.
Numerous depositions have been taken in
the suits affected by the so-called Craven
deeds.
The principal portion of the office work, in
cluding the preparation of papers, has fallen
to the lot of Mr. Mitchell, and the records
under his supervision are unparelled for sys
tem and neatness.
Messrs. Pier^on and McEnerney have at
tended for the most part to the court proceed
ing?, with the exception of application for or
ders, which have generally been conducted
by Mr. Mitchell. The labors have thus been
distributed among the three, and the three
should be considered in fixing the compensa
tion, although Messrs. Pierson and Mitchell are
l.artni'is.
The administrators are therefore allowed as
fees for their attorneys the sum of $12,500, in
addition to the amounts heretofore allowed,
making $22,500 as the total sum which each
attorney shall receive.
The legal services rendered in the matter of
the probate of the will, and in the suit of Fair
vÂ«. Angus, involving the validity of the trusts
under the will, are not Here taken into ac
count as services concerning the special ad
ministration.
As I have already said, I consider these
allowances amply, but in view of the fact that
the deceased himself paid and agreed to pay
the sum of $16,875 for services rendered by
Messrs. Gooofellow and McEnerney in obtain
ing the dissolution of temporary injunctions
in the two cases yet pending, of the Pacific Gas
Improvement Company vs. Ellert and Pacific
Gas Improvement Company vs. Fair, I do not
think that allowance can be regarded as ex
orbitant, or otherwise than just, from the
standpoint of the estate.
The total compensation heroin fixed foots
up to the sum of $52,500, which, added to the
compensation formerly allowed, makes a cost
to the estate for the services here Involved oi
a little over one-half of the amount requested.
I am not willing to go beyond this.
The clerk of the court is hereby directed to
cause to be inserted in the final account of the
special administrators or file the compensa
tion provided for by this opinion.
Chas. W. Slack, Judge.
December 30, 1890.
At the time tue application for the addi
tional compensation was made it was
generally considered that the amount re
quested would be granted by Judge Slack
as a matter of course, because no opposi
tion was suggested by :he heirs, and the
order tiled yesterday, as given above, will
come as a sad New Year's surprise to the
gentlemen interested. It may also sur
prise the heirs of the Fair estate.
WHAT ATTORNEYS SAY.
The Court Has the Sole Voice In
Fixing: the Compansatlon.
Attorney Pierson of the firm of Pierson
& Mitchell said last evening that the gen
eral facts were as follows: The adminis
trators asked for $172,000 and had pre
viously received $75,000. Judge Slack
allowed the administrators the following
sums yesterday : J. S. Angus $2ioo, T. J.
Crothers $2500, W. S. Goodlellow $2500. es
tate of L. C. Bresse $7500. The amount to
the BressÃ estate included $5000 which
Bresse would previously have received if
he had lived. The difference between
what tbe administrators asked for and
what they have been allowed altogether
is $82,000.
The attorneys for the special adminis
trators asked for a total sum of $129,000.
They had received, previous lo yesterday,
$30,000. The amounts allowed yesterday
were: Pierson & Mitchell, $25,000;
Garret W. McEnerney, $12,500. These
sums, with the amount previously
received, make up a total of $67,500. From
this it appears that Judge Slack has
si nick off $61,500, the difference between
$129,000 and what has altogether been al
lowed.
" We have no fault to find," said Mr.
Pierson. "The court has the sole say con
cerning the compensation of special ad
ministrators and the attorneys for the
administrators. Judj;e Slack ha* made
liis order and there is no more to be done
or said,"
Mr. Wheeler, of counsel for the heirs,
said last evening that uhile he hud not
previously heard of the reductions made
by Judge Slack, he could not complain,
for there would be so much more money
for the heirs.
The reductions amount to $143,000 in
total.
COONEY SIGNS IT.
Deposition cf the Notary as to
Fair's Acknowledgment of the
Craven Deeds Completed.
Notary J. J. Cooney yesterday signed
his deposition in the suit of Mrs. Craven
against the Fair heirs to recover posses
sion of the Mission and the Sansome street
properties. The deposition was taken
some time ago and since then has been
carefully read by Cocney. He made a few
corrections in the trjinscriit, and yester
day he and the lawyers got together in
Knight & Heggerty'n office, discussed the
corrections, which were not material, and
Cooney, everything being satisfactory,
signed the deposition.
This is the deposition in which Cooney
depose? that James G. I air came person
ally before him and acknowledged the
deeds in question.

WEDDED TO AND
BY A JUSTICE
Romantic Marriage of a
Young Light of the
Bench.
Why Judge Groezinger's Face
Has Recently Been All
Smiles.
Kept His Secret for Six Weeksâ The
Bride Was Miss Susie A.
Lawry.
Those who have noticed the look of
happy contentment on the face of Pre
siding Justice of the Peace Groezinger for
the past six weeks have been divided in
opinion as to whether he had recently
fallen heir to a fortune or had taken unto
himself a wife.
The latter were nearer the mark, for the
Judge baa been a benedict since Novem-
Presiding Justice Groezinger and His Pretty Bride, Formerly Miss
Susie A. Lawry.
ber 21 and has spent most of his time
since that date in keeping the matter
quiet.
Of course, the fact that he disappeared
regularly each day after the adjournment
of court and appeared no more until the
next morning gave many a shrewd sus
pition, but no one was able to tell any
thine about it.
it now transpires that on the date men
tioned a quiet little party, consisting of
Miss Susie A. Lawry, Justice Groezinster,
Justice Barry and the immediate friends
and relatives of the first two named, as
sembled at the re.->idence of T. J. Harris,
and that a brief but solemn ceremony took
the youngest member of the bench out of
-the ranks of tbe unmarried men. Justice
Barry officiated.
The bride is petite and exceedingly
pretty, and a neat little romance mages a
fitting prelude to the climax of Novem
ber 2L
One day early in last year, just as the
Justice was adjourning court for the day,
two ladies came into the courtroom, hav
ing lost their way in the hall in a vain
search among the gloomy corridors for
Judge Coffey's courtroom.
One was the present Mrs. Groezineer,
and the other a lady friend who was in
terested in the Blythe estate. The Justice
gallantly showed the ladies to their desti
nation and an acquaintance sprang up
between the young people that ended to
an engagement. It did not take the young
people long to decide on going life's jour
ney together, and the happy marriage
was the result.
Miss Lawry is a Placerville girl and
popular in the interior city. Justice
Groezinger is looked upon as a coming
light of the bench, having received more
votes at the late election than any of his
competitors for judicial honors.
AND STILL THEY COME
Many Chinese IVmales Recently Im
ported From China to this City.
People familiar with affairs iv and
about the Custom-house are wondering
why there is so much delay in the ap
pointing of an inspector who understands
the Chinese language. There has not
been such an officer since the disgraceful
scandal of Dick Williams. While this de
lay exists the importers of young Chinese
females are hard at work to get as many
as possible ashore before their efforts will
be balked by a conscientious inspector
who would be the means of turning back
these undesirable acquisitions to the local
population.
Some time ago it was known in this City
that there would be a large importation
of women to this port, and true to the
warning, they have arrived in large num
bers on the last two steamers from China.
In fact their departure from that country
was hastened by a cablegram from tbis
City to send the women along as quickly
as possible.
In response to this thirty-four were sent
on the China and City ot Pern. 0a the
latter there were twenty-oue arrivals of
this class, and it is stat?d that at least
nineteen are eligible to deportation.
Whether they will be sent back to China
remains to be seen. A singular and sig
nificant feature of this importation is that
one old hag who keep*? a notorious estab
lishment in the Chinese quarter in this
City sets up a claim of relationshiD to over
a dozen of these women, who range in age
from 18 to 22 years.
At present Dr. John Endicott Gardner
is acting as Chinese interpreter for the
Collector, but he is only permitted, it is
stated, to put Buch questions as he is di
rected.
Patrick Keyei Loses His Salt.
In the suit of PatricK Keyes against Millen
Griffith, Sampson Tarns, Qeorge C. Perkins
and Nellie Keane, a decision was handed
down by Judge Seawell yesterday in favor of
the defendants. Keyes sued for $55,200 on
account of some misunderstanding in regard
to tho Keyes silver mine. The court finds
that the plaintiff has only himself to blnme for
his loss, ir he sustained any, and it is adjudged
that defendant Perkins did not in any manner
influence or control the board of directors of
the Keyes Mining Company.
Death of a Scientist.
Information has been received by the
Geographical Society of the Pacific of this
City, announcing the death at San Salvador
of Dr. Albert Sanchez, direcor of the Meteoro
logical ana Astronomical Observatory of the
State of San Salvador, on the 25th of lnst
October. Ha is represented as one of the most
distinguished scientists of that section of the
world. Don Julian Aparicio was appointed
to fill the vacancy.

stock Joshua Hendy at the time of his deÂ«th
WRB the owner and in possession oi 330-4
shares, and that the balance of said capital
stock, amounting lo 1674 shares, were then
and still are unissued ; that on or about the 14th
nay of July, 1896, Samuel J. Hendy, John H.
Hendy aud Mary Frances MuGurn tiled a peti

prayed, among other things, 107 Â« â = si-der of
court distributing to them a portion of il;etr
respective shares or said eÂ«wue; that by ihe
will of Joshua Hendv is provided, among other
things, that Crmrles'V. Manner shou.d receive

After thus disposing of the important
point thst Mr. Manner and Mrs. Eoush
ore entitled to only one-nfti-th each of
the capital stock of the Hendy Machine
Works, the court entered a decree direct
ing that the shares thus specified shall be
immediately delivered to the respective
parties in interest without the require
ment of any bond on their part.
The court adds that this distribution is
ordered and made without prejudice to the
rights of the respective parties to the bal

The estate is practically out of debt, is
worth $400,000 and is constantly increasing
in value.
Tie estate was represented in this Hti
eatlon by E. B. Young, W. H. H. Hart
and Nowlin & Fassett.
It is considered probable that the long
legal controversy that has been raging
will in tho near future be brought to an
end.
J. ROSS JACKSON'S
DAYS ARE ENDED
His Life Ebbs Away
After a Heroic
Operation.
Career of a Man Respected and
Loved by All Who Knew
Him,
Funeral Services Will Take Place
at the Press Club Among His
0;d Friends.
J. Ross Jackson died at the Waldeck
sanitarium at 5:30 p. K. yesterday. He
had undergone an operation two days pre
viously for the removal of a cancer and
the ordeal hastened his death. The end,
howt.ver, was not far off, for the nature of
the malady forbade hope, and hi 3 physi
cians adopted a heroic measure with the
chances all against them. He held up
bravely after the operation and indeed im
proved a little Tuesday.
This false change was the result moie of
Mr. Jackson's strong mentality coupled
with a sense of confidence in the surgeons'
work, which inspired him to entertain a
view of still more years of happiness with
family and dear old friends. But the
struggle proved too much for his vitality
and he began to fail yesterday. Almost
until the last he was conscious, even while
the vital forces were ebbing away like the
nickering of a taper, and so death came
full of peace to this good man.
For nearly a year Koss Jackson, as he
was familiarly known by hosts of friends
in Bohemia and out of it, complained of
ill health. His physician placed him
under a regimen of diet and treatment and
it is believ,'d that the fatal disease then
began its ravages. "The doctor says I
must not indulge," Mr. Jackson said to
some friends when the trouble began.
"But I'm considering that matter,
whether the game is worth the candle.
What's the use of living if you can't en
joy li c with your friend 3?" Always tem
perate in his life, this little remark was
taken as an illustration of the man's fine
characer, his geniality and warmth.
About that time he experienced serious
trouble with his eyes und had an opera
tion j erformed on one of them at his resi
dence, the St. Nicholas Hotel. He went
to Sausalito for r.-st, which improved his
condition, but even then the family physi
cian entertained little hopes of long
life for his patient.
Subsequently Mr. Jackson rallied and
was about as usual ns if nothing ailed
him. He was a member of the Grand
Jury that went out of ( ffice a week or two
ago and attended to duties in that body.
He visited his favorite resort, the Press
Club, and only recently dropped out of
signt. Then his friends learned with deep
regret that Mr. Jackson had not long to
live.
He realized that he was on the verge of
collapse for several days, and on Sunday
atternoon, on the acvice of physiciaus,
moved to the Wa:deck Hotel. Mrs. Jack
ion, his faithful nurse, remained by his
side. Her wish was to try the one heroic
remedy, which failed in spite of the best
surgical skill attainable.
J. Ross JacKson was a general favorite.
To know him was but to love him, and
that tells the whole story of the man's
life. His was a remarKable character;
generous to a fault, loyal to friends and
ever ready to see only the best side in
oihern, and in home lite a devoted father
and husband.
He wns born in Paterson, N. J., Febru
ary 6, 1846. His father was James Jack
son, a locomotive builder, who built the
hrst locomotive that came to the Pacific
Coast and amnssed a lortune in this busi
ness. James Jackson organizeJ the Bank
of Passaic County, which merged iir.o the
Second National Bank, still a flourishing
institution. After college days young
Ross tilled the position of naying teller in
ibe bank und his brother James is now it)
president. Resigning the office Ross
moved lo California and took up his resi
dence in this City, which was always his
home with the exception of a few months
in summer spent in the country. He ltft
New Jersey April 1, 1875.
In 1872 he married Miss Amelia W alden
of Puterson, with whom he lived happily
till the end. Two daughters were born,
one of whom was a popular belle in local
society and is now the wife of Mr. John
Raffael of the Tivoli. The other daughter
died come years ago. He leaves two sis
ters, Mrs. Caroline Whitleyand Miss Kate
Jackson, both of whom live at Evanston,
III.; also a brother, James Jackson, in
Paterson, N. J.
After settling in San -Francisco Mr.
JacKson tried his hand at commercial
work in the asbestos business, but he was
not intended for such uncongenial occu
pation and accordingly met with poor
success.
He took the world easy, having a nice
income, until in 1880 he entered the news
paper held, and quickly attained promi
nence in his chosen profession. Every
newspaper writer in the City declares that
he was their dean. It was he who brought
out such well-Known wriiers as Ed Town
send, Andy Morrison, Harry Dum, T. T.
Williams und others who hÂ»ve long since
passed awayâ Joseph Gitt, William Hart
and Harry Standewiclc. He was city
editor of the Alia, then associated himself
with the Chronicle and later with the Ex
aminer, oi which he was city editor.
An affection of 'he eyes compelled him
to retire from journalism twice, when he
tilled a position hi the County Clerk's
office and >vas License Collector. In
newspaper work he proved himself a dis
tinctly broad-gauge und able man, and, it
goes witt out saying, won the respect and
love of his colleagues without exception.
Mr. Jackson was a veteran of the Civil
War, and at one time a member of Thomas
Post. G. A. R. He was president oi the
old Press Club, organized in 1882, suc
ceeding Hueh Burke and .giving way a
year later to Ed Townsend. When Â»he
present Press Club wasorganized he joined
as a charter memDer. Oiten he was the
lite of it at jinks as sire, ...id when occa
sion called for Ins advice he proved a loyal
member. The Olympic and Bonemian
clubs also claimed him as one of their own.
Upon retiring from active newspaper
life about four years ago he fell heir to a
large fortune from his father's estate.
These years were spent with his family in
taking the best out of life, with hi* bosom
friends, James V. Coleman and some
members of the Press Club.
A few days before Mr. Jackson died he
caned in ex-Judge W. P. Lawlor to make
his will. It i-> understood that his estate
goes to his family. In the will is a pro
vision expressing a wish that as he was
not religious he would be consistent, and,
therefore, desired that no minister preach
at his funeral.
He asked that the obsequies be held in
the Press Club, and that either Judge
Hunt or T. T. Williams, his old friends,
should say something about his life be
side the bier.
The date of the funeral was not deter
mined last night, but it will probably be
| Sunday next. Meanwhile the body will
remain at his residence, the St. Nicholas
Hotel.
The funeral will take place from the
Press Club, and in accordance with his
special desire the remains will be cre
mated at Odd Fellows' cemetery.

BURGLARS BEING
BROUGHT IN
Clever Capture by Special
Officer C A. Heine
man.
The Residence of A. K. Coney,
Mexican Consul, Broken
Into.
One of the Burglars Chased and
Overtaken by Heineman and
His Brother.
The residence of Alexander K. Coney,
Mexican Consul, 1522 Post street, was en
tereJ by two burglars last night during
the absence of the family and one of them
was cleverly captured by Special Officer
Charles S. fieineman, assisted by his
brother Felix, and taken to the City
Prison.
About 6:30 o'clock, Carlos Cuervo,
nephew of the Consul, who lives in the
house, reached home from his work at the
Union Iron Works. On opening the par
lor door he saw convincing evidence of
the Jact that strangers had been In the
house. Everything in the room was
topsy-turvy, and when he heard the
voices of two men in an adjoining room
he quietly slipped out, and running to
the grocery-store on Laguna and Post
streets he told Dave Lazar, the grocery
man, that burglars were in the house.
As the policeman on the beat baa gone
to the lire on Golden Gate avenue and
Larkin street Lazar telephoned to the
engine-house on Post street, near Fill
more. Heineman and his brother fortu
nately happened to be in the engine-house
and they at once ran to the Consul's resi
dence.
Heineman tried to open the front door,
but it was locked. He and his brother
went to the rear. Heineman told his
brother to watch the parlor window as he
saw the curtains moving and he would try
and force open another window.
Just then one of the burglars threw open
the rarlor window and jumped to the
ground. He clashed across the garden and
into an alley ciose by pursued by Heine
man and his brother. Tn the alley h^
turned sharply round and holding a re
volver in one hand and a â¢'jimmy" in the
other he threatened to "do" for them un
less they stopped chasing him.
They made â  dash at him and he turned
ami cor.tinaed his night along Laguna
strret. As he passed Cedar avenue he
threw a clock and the "jimmy" into the
avenue, which were aftrrwarJ picked up
and will be held as evidence against him.
He hail not ran much lurther when Felix
Heineman overlook him and knocked him
down. Just then the special officer jumped
on top of him and had the irons on him
before he had time to make any show of
resistance.
The Central police station was notified,
and Policemen Coogan and Kourke were
s^ent with the patrol wagon to lake the
burglar to the City Prison. searched
there three silk handkerchief?, which he
had stolen from the house, were found in
his rockets.
The burglar was stylishly dressed and
wore a fine macintosh coat He pave his
name as James Line, but Detectives Si!
vey and Egan recogniz d him as James
Hughes, an ex-convict. He was booKed on
tho charges of burglary and baviug burg
lars' tools in his possession.
Policeman Coogan visited the house,
and it presented tue appearance of having
been visited by a cyclone. Every room
had been ransacked, and. the contents of
the bureau drawers, trunks and other arti
cles were strewn over the iloors. How
much Droperty has been stolen is not
known, as the Mexican Consul was not at
home last night.
It is supposed that the bure'ar who
escaped got away with considerable
booty. It ii thought he escaped by
the front door while Heineman aud his
brother were in the rear.
The capture of Hughes and the capture
of Daly and Decry, alias Rutherford, Tues
day night, have given the greatest satis
faction to the "upper office," as they are
I notorious burglars.

The Finance Committee of the Board c __
Supervisors held a final and important {
meeting last eveningâ important if its ;,^; ,^
recommendations be respected by the '
board itself. â¢
It was a case of cleaning up the Â» oxâ the
box containing the business of the com-,
mittee for the year. Three important mat
ters were considered. First, the proposition
to purchase the property which the courts,
after years rrfli Motion, have decided be
longs "to S. W. fa . ;ay, lying within the
lines of Lafayette Part. The property
amounts to a -block of land, bat Clay
street extending into it leaves a strip of
private property on both sides of that
street and for 400 feet of its length, within
the lines ; of what was originally set aside'
as Lafayette Park.
City and County Attorney Creswell was
present at the meeting and joined in tr- â -.
discussion. The following resolution, or;
recommendation, was adopted: .':
