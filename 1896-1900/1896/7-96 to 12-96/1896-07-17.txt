GRINDING HER LIFE OUT ON

at io O'clock.
ON BOARD P. M. 8. 8. COLOMBIA,
â¢shore off Pigeon Point (via Pescadero),
July 16.â T0 write with the deck buckling
under one's feet and the long saloon table
twisting like a thing in mortal agony, with
the pointed rocks gnawing deeper into the
shattered hull at every hurl of the lung
cround swell, is not an easy matter, not
lor even a brief period. To hear the great
ateel frame of the ship groan and grind on
its rivets as she wallows woundedly like
a living creature of the sea, to hear the
wild and useless blows she strikes at the
cruel reef that holds her in its never
loosening grip, is apt to make one think
disjointedly and wordlessly, and when
the writer knows that the big metal hull,
under the mighty strain, may break in
two, letting more or leas of the crew and
possibly a reporter drop, with an un
finished story, down among the splintered
plates and beams, where the incoming sea
can slosh him around carelessly and prob
ably stranele him before the sharp frag
ments of wreck have worked him an in
jury, he is liable to become imbued with a
longing for country life and the stability
of the everlasting, ever stationary hills.
ABANDONMENT OF THE WRECKED STEAMER COLOMBIA OFF PIGEON POINT.
Yesterday after the men had all left the ship the Captain came down the gangway and silently seated himself among
his crew. They pulled away, leaving the steamer to wallow on the reef, her lamps gleaming from the cabin windows.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
Your correspondent boarded the wrecked
Colombia yesterday evening, intending to
go ashore after learning her condition and
abou: how long she will probably hold to
gether in her uneasy bed.
The rising tide lifted the after part of
her body clear of the rocks, leaving the
extreme forward portion resting on the
reef. When the tide is hieh she pivots, as
it were, on her strong stem, which grinds
and grinds into the ledge and keeps the
water in that locality thick with mud,
broken shells and torn-up weeds. That
crunching can be beard sounding
out of the sea nicht and day. The doomed
Colombia struggles hard and rends the
rocks in her dying. Then she rolls â not
the smooth, graceful swing of tho ship in
clining to the sloping send of the sea, but
a heave, a jerk and a heavy shock that
booms dully through ncr frame. There is
a twist in tne hull, caused by the motion
of the floating stern under the strokes of
the waves. If one is carelessly standing
near a longitudinal bulicbead he is fetched
up standing against it, and if he is close
to a thwartship partition he catches that
too. Often He gets them both.
From the wide rents in the bottom the
water has come in, filling the forward hold
flush between decks and washing off the
hatch covers. In this hold were stored
cases, large and small, of merchandise.
By the bumping of the vessel the boxes
were dislodged and broken open, and the
violent churning of the mass of water did
the rest. No name can be given to that
mixture of broom-handles, gayly painted
children's toys, canned vegetables, pack
ages of underwear, tinware, baskets, rolls
of pap t, straw and thousand! of splint
ers. Cases of limes were ground to frag
ments, and the odorous contents squashed
and squeezed amone the debris. That
hold is a veritable lemonade bowl, and the
pungent citric smell of its contents per
vades the whole ship.
A large consignment of ochre-coiored
footballs float merrily in the big tank, and
the writer got several duckings in his
i frantic efforts to secure one as a memento.
[ During the afternoon several of the crew
â¢ engaged in the rather perilous pastime of
j fishing for articles over the hatch comb
j ings. To have been thrown among that
, mass by the jump of the hull and washed
under the deck by that rushing whirlpool
would have been destruction to the fisher.
As the tide rose the motion of the vessel
became freer and more violent. The
grinding under the sea and the fall of the
great hulk onto the rocks makes one feel
i earthquakyâ that cold sensation about the
j heart wtiich is always apparent when sub
. terranean tremors come up one's legs and
spread over the nerve centers. The steel
bulkheads began to buckle and roll into
ridges like a canvas screen, and the strong
decks, braced to the metal beams, ran in
! waves fore and aft. The ponderous ma
j chiuery in tha engine-room would spring
upward fully six inches and swing from
1 starboard to port, while massive boilers

knock together. Then everything would
settle back in place during the short in
terval of quiet, with not a rivet started,
not a glass globe shattered.
When Roach <fc Sons hammered the
Colombia into form four years ago they
builded better probably than even they
knew. She is as flexible as the blade of a
rapier and as fibrous as a watchspring.
With all the cruel batterine, twisting,
wrenching and bending that noble frame
comes splendidly back into the lines her
designer drew. As she lies there, her
shapely bow to the sunny shore and her
stern to the blue sea, she will sail no more
â she dies like a queen.
She yields to the stroke that destroys
her, and in death she triumphs. And her
master, Captain Clark, whatever the error
that led his splendid vessel out of the safe
open into the little horseshoe bay that
will be forever associated with her name,
be it the fog that obscured and bewildered,
the chartless current that deflected, or the
iron environed compass that deviated and
threw the Colombia into the teeth of the
reef that is eating her life away, conscious
as he is of the grave ever yawning beneath
his keel, bends alwayÃ his every effort to
the salvation of his ship. And snips and
sailors, too, are oftimes lost.
Captain Clark's manner since the dis
aster has brought him into prominence,
has stamped him a cool, clearheaded man.
He quieted his passengers, held his crew
in hand, and while the rocks were ripping
the sheets of metal from his vessel sent
the travelers down to oreakfast. Now he
walks the decks, while the reef grinds and
grates under him, destroying both the
snip and her masterâ a quiet, court -ous
gentleman.
At dark a heavier swell began to roll in
and the pounding of the huik on the reef
grew alarming, at least to the newspaper
man. The big smokestack pulled hard at
its guy ropes and the masts whipped in
their stoppings iike nshroda. The interior
of the vessel creaked ominously as the
Bteel bulkheads bent to the awful pressure
of the sea without and the water within.
There was twenty feet in the forward com
partment and six feet aft, while the mid
dle compartment was clear. This left the
engine and fireroom dry, but it was ex
pected every roll that the bulkheads would
go and flood that space, and bo drown the
dynamo and leave the ship in darkness.
As a precaution all the lanterns were
lighted and well secured where their globes
would not be shattered. Glass has a pre
carious existence in the jump and plunge
of the laboring hulk.
As the night came on the situation grew
more dismal and horrible. A person walk
ing along the unlighted upper deck could
not tell how the vessel was going to roil
or which way. She would slope halt over
in a swing, then go the other way, to
fetch up with a bump on the rocks. She
bumped on both sides and in the middle,
and always there was that dreadful saw

MANY LIVES LOST
IN THE CHANNEL.
Cleveland the Scene of One
More Most Appalling
Disaster.
FERKY-BOAT CAPSIZED.
About Twenty Men Drowned
During the FearJul Struggles
of the Victims.
CROWDED ON AN UNSAFE CRAFT
Loaded to the Gunwale by Living
Freight the Vessel Is Easily
Swamped.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 16.â The most
appalling disaster which has ever occurred
in Cleveland, excepting only the Viaduct
horror last winter, when a loaded street
car plunged 100 feet into the river, oc
curred to-night at 8 o'clock. While a flat
bottomed ferryboat, loaded with between
forty and fifty laborers, was crossing the
old river channel it was capsized and all
the men thrown into the channel and be
tween fifteen and twenty drowned.
The bodies found thus far are those of:
Charles Sproeke, married, seven children;
William Saunders, married, one child;
August Hasten, married; Michael Lynch;
Fritz Bortels ; Chris Gerlach ;â Prokup;
Charles Bohermeister, married; Julius
Erkhe, married; Chris Gehren, married;
unknown man at Gallagher's morgue; un
known man at Hogan & Sherer's morgue;
Charles Kraus, widower, three children;
Edward Ryan, married.
The accident was dee to a panic on
hoard. The boat was loaded until the
cunwhale was only three inches above the
water, and a passing tug made waves
which came into the boat. At once there
was a rush to the other side and the boat
went under. The men were members of a
gang of ore handlers and were coming
home from work.
The scene in the river was one of a wild
Btrug gle for life. Men grappled each other
and went down in their fierce struggles,
while cries for help strucK horror to the
souls of witnesses. Lines and life pre
servers were thrown from the tug and the
steamer London, which was also passing,
and many were pulled aboard. Others of
the unfortunates were rescued by small
boats and some swam ashore.
The life-saving crew was summoned and
the work of searching for bodies at once
began. Within a short time seven of the
unfortunates were Drought to shore and
taken to the Morgue for identification.
Those who escaped scattered in every
direction and it is uncertain just bow
many lives were lost. Twenty men are re
ported missing and the dragging of the
channel is still in progress.
The crowding of the boat was due to the
fact that the ore gangs pay just so much
per trip on the ferry and the more that got
on the less the cost to the passengers. The
men mostly' lived on Gauge street and Sel
den avenue which lead down to the docks
and shipyards and the scenes there were
indescribable. Men. women and children
ran about screaming and much disorder
prevailed.
By 11 o'clock to-night fourteen bodies
have been recovered and taken to the
various Morgues. Among those who were
rescued was Richard Hasten, engineer of
the new steamer Sir Henry Bessemer,
which was lying at the ore dock.
When he saw the boat was turning be
jumped, but was caught under the scow
when it turned over, and working his way
underneath the boat, getting air by rising
in the overturned craft, he managed at
last to dive clear of the wreck and swam
to his own vessel and was pulled aboard.
He was the only passenger aside from the
ore-handlers.
An immense crowd soon gathered on
the banks of the river watching the work
of the boats conducting the searc:i.
Among them was William Benlow, a
pressman. In moving about he lost his
footing, fell into the river and was
drowned.
The scenes enacted by the undertakers
were disgusting in the extreme. They al
most came to blows in their anxiety to
gain possession of the bodies, and the po
lice had to interfere in the interest of de
cency.
FAREWELL. PEARY.
The Lieutenant Starts on Another Voyage
of Exploration.
SYDNEY, C. 8., July 16.â The steamer
Hope with Lieutenant Peary's Arctic ex
pedition on board, sailed from here co-day
on her northern voyage of exploration.
Lieutenant Peary thinks the Hope will
return the latter part of September.
GUARDED BY THE TROOPS
Non-Union Men Having a Hard
Time at the Brown Hoist
ing Works.
Jeering Crowds Charged by the
Militia and Many Men Are
Wounded.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 16.â The
strike situation at the Brown Hoisting
Works assumed so dangerous a phase this
afternoon that three more companies of
troops were hurried to the scene just be
fore quitting time and are now encamped
at the works. Early in the afternoon
crowds began to assemble and stood about
sullenly, defiant of police orders to move
on.
There was so much evidence of a prear
ranged plan, every street leading to the
works having its own division of the mob,
j that the authorities in hot haste sent for
more troops. When the *ixty-three men
who bad been at work were placed in vans
to be driven home from the works it was
found necessary to charge the mob twice
before a passage could be made for the
wagoiis. The drivers had refused to leave
j the stables with the vehicles and police
men did the driving.
During the melee jeers and threats were
hurled at the non-union men, police and
military, and some stones thrown. The
severest fighting was on Hamilton street,
and in the charges about forty strikers
| were pricked with bayonets. After a pass
age had been opened the military had all
it could do to keep the howling mob from
chasing the wagons.

ST. LOUiS, Mo., July 16. j
Delegates to the Populist and Silver
conventions are oozing into St. Louis
very slowly. There are not more than
two dozen here yet, and these are
reticent on the subject of the Demo
cratic indorsement. Most of them be
lieve that silver is the only issue before
the people.
Dr. Shattinger has opened a middle
of-the-road headquarters, and gives his
reasons why a Populist should be a
Populist and not a tool of the corrupt
Democracy.
The opinion is gaining ground here
that there will he a sufficient number
of honest and conscientious delegates
in the convention to defeat any propo
sition looking toward fusion or indorse
ment.
The Democracy continues to fall to
pieces. Here it is tumbling into the
black waters of the Mississippi, sev
eral notable defections having taken
place within the past twenty-four
hours.
JOHN PAUL COSGKAVK.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 16.â The Demo
cratic bolt from the anarchist trouble put
up at Chicago is going on merrily. Old
Missouri has swung into line, and yester
day on the banks of the Mississippi de
nounced and renounced the platform and
the candidates put up at Chicago. The
bolters are some of the most representa
tive business men and citizens in the
State, including Colonel James G. Bread
head, ex-Minister to Switzerland; ex-Gov
ernor David R. Francis, Judge H. S.
Priest and others equally as prominent in
the councils of the Democracy. Their
plan is not to put up a third ticket, but to
make the fight, on Presidential Electors,
Congressmen and members of the Legis
lature. They are in favor of anything
that will beat the Chicago ticket.
The Jefferson Club will follow. This
body is in St. Louis what the Iroquis Club
used to be in San Francisco. The mem
bers of the Merchants' Exchange Club are
indignant over the report published in a
Bryan paper that the club had invited
Mr. Bryan to speak in St. Louis. They
have repudiated Mr. Bryan and Governor
Aitgeld's platform and will support McÂ«
Kinley. After the adoption of the crank
platform at Chicago the club declined to
bulletin the remainder of the proceedings
in its place of business. Its membership,
composed of solid business men and the
first citizens of St. Louis, is a unit for
sound money.
So from other States all along the line
come reports of Democratic disaffection,
and the noise of the falling party is louder
than that which was heard when the walls
of Jericho came tumbling down. These
honest Democrats r<?gret the course which
they are taking, but they say that it is
necessary for the party to be purified, no
matter what the sacrifice may be, and that
whether the party survives or perishes the
warning will accomplish much good here
after and the people of the United States
will be saved from anarchistic rule. The
few early Populist delegates who have al
ready arrived in St. Louis are silver men.
Every one of them declines to be inter
viewed as to his sentiments on fusion with
the Democracy or indorsement of its nomi
nees. It is apparent that if they were
straight, middle-of-the-road Populists
they would not only have no objection to
declare themselves as such, but they would
glory in the fact and proclaim it from the
housetops. Their reticence can therefore
be susceptible of two interpretations
only â either that they have not yet made
up their minds and are waiting to take
the pulse of the majority of the delegates,
or that they are in favor of indorsing the
Democratic ticket and do not like to men
tion that fact so soon. Not one of them
will talk except on glittering generalities.
They have surrounded themselves with
the mysterious paraphernalia of a con
spiracy.
But the straight Populists are out in the
open and are declaring their sentiments
boldly. They can't be turned by argu
ment, nor can they be moved by threats or
cajolery. The only problem to be solved
in their case is as to their number. How
many are there of them? This fact can't
be satisfactorily ascertained until the
greatest part of the delegates arrive on
the ground and a careful canvass has
been made.
There is one thing that the true friends
of Populism have to fear, and that is the
corruption in its own membership.
There are as corrupt scoundrels in the
ranks of the Populists as there are in any
other party. These may be bribed with
the combined sack of the Democracy and
the silver men, if any bribery is to be at
tempted, and that is a matter that will be
watched keenly by the honest men in the
party.
I had a talk this morning with Dr. G2
Shattinger, the local leader of straight
middle-of-the-road Populists. The doctor
has rented a large store next to the La
clede House as the headquarters of the
straights. This room will be fitted up and
ready for business by next Sunday and it
will be one of the liveliest camps in the
field. Dr. Shattinger does not belong to
the House of Want and is not, therefore,
trying to break into the House of Have. He
resides in a neat two-story brick cottage at
2209 Sidney street and enjoys a lucrative
practice as a physician. He is a young
and active man and apparently sincere in
his belief In the principles of his party.
He joined it in 1892 b'-cause he was dis
gusted with what he believed to be the
corruption of ihe two old parties and that
Is one of the principal reasons why he is
opposed to combining with either one of
them now. Tee doctor must have suf
fered at the hands of some unscrupulous
reporter, for with rare and unnecessary
caution be declined to consent to be inter
viewed unless I agreed to write my ques
tions and his answers on carbonized paper
so that he could have a copy in my hand
writing in case I should misquote him to
his injury. Aly first question was:
"Do you think it advisable or proper to
affiliate with any other political organiza
tion or to indorse the candidates of such?"
"Not if that organization be Democratic
or Republicau," was his reply.
"Why?"
"Because the Populist party originated
in an attempt at independent politics; be
cause there never has been known a case
in history where any reform was achieved
by an old party; because, while there may
be honest and well-meaning men in the
Republican and Democratic parties, both
those parties are honeycombed with cor
tuption."
The speaker paused before giving utter
ance to the following significant sentence:
"Tbe indorsement of any man who has
not definitely severed his connection with
either the Republican or Democratic par
ties would make the People's party an ad
junct of the party whose candidate had
been indorsed, and would result in the
utter annihilation of its organisation."
"Why are you specially opposed to in
dorsing Mr. Bryan?"
"Mr. Bryan may be a true, liberal
minded, even radical, man, but his elec
tion by no means signifies the triumph of
principles which be may personally favor.
Laws are made by Congress, not by the
President, and tbe people have absolutely
no guarantee tbat Democrats in general
have suddenly become purified and will
give us even so little as tbe free coinage ot
silver, in view of their black record in tbe {
Senate and House of Representatives on '
this very question. The Democrats have
merely taken up the popular cry for free
silver to save their party irom utter de
struction, to the verge of which it has
been brought by the odinm attached to
their last administration. They are catch
ing at the free-silver issue as a drowning
man catches at a straw."
A picturesque Populist is J. Harvey Da
vis, popularly known as "Cyclone Davis."
The Cincinnati Enquirer bestowed this so
briquet upon him on the occasion of bis
memorable debate with General Hardin,
who was running for State Attorney on
the Democratic ticket in Kentucky.
On that occasion General Hardin did
not show up well, and in its report of the
affair the Enquirer said that the general
had been deceived in his man and that he
had struck a cyclone. Mr. Davis 1 manner
is quite breezy, bat not in a cyclonic way.
He stands several mencs over six feet and
wean a black slouch sombrero with a
brim so wide that Mr. Davis does not need
to carry an umbrella. He is a member of
the National Executive Committee and is
an ardent silver man. He has just re
turned from a campaigning tour through
Alaoama, where he had been talking sti
ver and Populism. When I heard that, I
knew that he would not express an
opinion on the question of indorsing the
Democracy, and he did not. He is one of
the first lawyers in the State to leave the
Democracy, and did so at a time when
that party had a majority of 175,000.
Owing to tne existence of the People's
party that majority has been reduced to
42.000. At the last election the Populist
vote was 162,000, and Mr. Davis predicts
that it will reach 200,000 this year.
f 'lf the Republicans in Texas don't vote
the Democrat ticket," he added, "the
Populists will defeat the Democrats by
60,000."
"When did you leave the Democracy*"
I asked.
*Â»I left it when Cleveland wrote that the
silver dollar was a dishonest dollar," re
plied the Cyclone.
When asked as to what he thought of
the proposed indorsement of Bryan he re
plied that he did not care to express any
opinion on tnat subject. He had no au
thority to speak for others, and he did not
want to say anything himself t&is'early in
the campaign. Mr. Davis is a member of
tbe National Committee, and is spending
the greater part of bis time consulting
with Chairman Taubeneck and preparing
for the work of the convention.
Sergeant-at-arms McDowell returned
from Littie Rock, Ark., to-day. He re
ports a lively time at tne Populist State
Convention over the question of indorsing
Bryan. The motion to indorse was de
feated by a vote of 107VÂ£ to 120}Â£. This
vote is characteristic of the strong fight
that is being made by the friends of cilver.
Opinion here is tbat unless the political
weather chaupes the silver men will not
be able to control a majority of the 1300
votes of tbe People's Party Convention
and secure the indorsement of the Demo
cratic nominees.
A cloud without tne necessary silver lin
ing is overcasting the Democratic rty.
The Populists are not so easily sirened as
the silver-tongued orators of the Democ
racy bad believed. The former knew that
the balance of power lies in the hollow of
their band, and they are resenting the
arrogance and selfishness of the silver fac
tion of the Democracy, which asks all and
is not willing to give anything.
Ex-Governor John Price Buchanan |of
Tennessee, at a late hour to-night, opened
his lips on the main question for the first
time. He told me that he was not in favor
of fusion with the Democracy for several
reasons. One of these reasons was tbat he
is not satisfied with the financial plank in
tbe Democratic platform. He was not in
favor of silver monometallism, but was in
favor of fiat money aud the making of gold,
silver, iron, copper and paper a currency
invariable in value and always at par,
with no predominance of one over the
other by tbe fiat of the Government mak
ing them legal tenders. The essence of
money is fiat. He therefore could not in
dorse the Democratic candidates. He
would be willing to agree that the Popn
lists should be allowed in tbe several
States their first proposition of Presiden
tial electors, but he said that the Demo
crats were not willing to compromise on '
this basis and meet the Populists halfway.
Tbcy wanted to hog it all.

POPULISTS ON THE WAY.
Delegates From California Do Not
Favor Bryan and Sewall by
Any Means.
RENO. Nkv., July 16.â Most o! the
Populist delegates from California to the
National Convention at St. Louis are on
their way in a special tourist car by way of
the Central Pacific. Denver and Rio Grande
and Missouri Pacific, theothers having gone
by tbe southern route. A careful canvass
shows that a decided majority favor
absolutely independent action by the
Populist Convention, though all seem
willing to concede to the Democrats the
executive branch of the Government, and
reserve for themselves the legislative
branch, provided there is an equal divis
ion of all executive appointments, includ
ing tbe Cabinet.
But many feel a strenuous objection to
supporting Mr. Sewall, a National banker,
even on tne Democratic naif of the alliance,
for tbe Vice-Presidency. They feel tbat it
would be far better to recall the nomi
nation of Sewall and substitute a good
Southern Populist.
There is not a single delegate willing to
indorse Bryan and Sewall, and thus prac
tically vote to become Democrats and
annihilate tbe Populist party. True, there
were two or three delegates whose admira
tion for Bryan warps their judgment, who
would treat with the Democracy on more
favorable terms, but they are not aggres
sive.
Much indignation was expressed by tbe
San Francisco delegation on reading in
the St. Louis dispatches this morning that
J. T. Flynn, one of George W. Baker's
delegates at large to the Silver convention,
is posing as a Populist and editor of a de
funct paper, formerly published in San
Francisco, called The Populist, and giv
ing out that "there may be some doubt
about what tbe Populist convention may
do, but there is no doubt about what the
Populists themselves will do. They will
vote for Bryan almost to a man." He
also oracularly says: "There is very little
difference between the Omaha platform
and the Chicago platform," which shows
what kind of Populist Mr. Flynn is.
To show further cause for tbe indigna
tion of the San Francisco delegation it is
proper to say that about the time the so
called "Populist" became defunct, the
San Francisco Populist County Commit
tee passed a resolution denouncing the
publication as not a true and reliable Popu
list paper and warning Populists not to
place any confidence in it. It was tbe in
tention of the committee to have the reso
lution published all over the State, but
the demise of the paper made it unneces
sary.
Mr. Flynn is not known as a Populist by
tbe active Populists who are identified
witn the City and County organization.
It is a noteworthy fact that it is only the
office-holding or ex-official Populists, and
the class of which Mr. Flynn is a type,
that seem ready to sacifice the People's
party to become what John S. Dore aptly
designates deputy Democrats. They are
the driftwood which will soon be bedded
in the mud on the stieam so well known
in political history as Salt River.

STRICKLER FOR BRYAN.
Thinks It Proper for His Party to
Indorse the Nominee of the Chi-
cago Convention.
OMAHA, Nebk., July 16.â V. O. Strick
ler, a member of the National Executive
Committee of tbe People's party was seen
to-day by a representative of the United
Press, and asked for bis opinion as to the
course the Populist party would pursue at
St. Louis. He said :
"I Delieve that the nominee of the Chi
cago convention will be indorsed at St.
Louis. It is the only thing the party can
do. The nomination of a separate ticket
would result in diridins the silver vote,
and would be directly in the interest of
McK'nley and the gold standard. Such a
course would demonstrate that Populists
are more loyal to their party than the
principles for which the party stands. I
know there are many true and noble men
in the People's party who had confidently
expected that financial reform would come
through tbat organization, but I don't be
lieve that there is any man in tbe party
who is so selfish as to oppose that reform
merely because it does not come through
his own party.
"There is no personal sacrifice which
they will not make in order to obtain re
lief from the terrible blight of gold mono
metallism.
"To my mind it would be worse than
folly to nominate a separate ticket. No
man of recognized standing in the party
could be induced to accept the nomina
tion. It would be an empty honor. I
believe that wisdom and patriotism alike
dictate that all persons who are opposed
to the single cold standard should sub
ordinate every other consideration and
give to William J. Bryan the fullest pos
sible support. Soch a course would, I be
lieve, almost certainly result in his elec
tion, and witb him as President tbe peo
ple may rest assured that no foreign Gov
ernment will be permitted to meddle in
our private affairs or dictate the kind of
laws that we should pass."

Newlands of Nevada to Be
Temporary Chairman of

But It Is Probable That Bryan
Will Get the Much-Desired
Indorsement.
AWAIT ACTION BY POPULISTS.

Preferences.
The Call's Headquarters,) !
Hotel Lixdell, v
St. Louis, Mo., July 16. )
Francis G. Newlamis of Nevada will be
temporary chairman of the National con
vention of the Silver party. The selection
was decided on by Chairman Mott of the
National Committee to-day. It is probable
that William Pope St. John of New York
will be the permanent chairman. Any
way he is the only person talked of for the
place, and if be will accept he can get It
without the asking. St. John is especially
strong with the silverites since he ttirew
up his sl6,ooo-a-year bank job and became
a politician. He could probably secure
the Presidential nomination of his party
if he so desired, but St. John declares he
is sincere in advocating tbe election of a
silver man regardless of his other political
affiliations. I nave no reason to doubt him.
From the way Ib* wind is blowing in
St. Louis to-day the indorsement of Bryan
by the Silver Convention seems probable.
I am safe in saying that he is the strong
est candidate in the field at this hour.
His recommendation to the consideration
of the silver voter by the party convention
depends very much on just what action
the Populists take. Both party conven
tions will convene in this city next
Wednesday.
Each convention will have about the
same number of delegates. For the Silver
Convention the number of delegates ap
portioned to each State and Territory is as
follows: Alabama 40. Arizona 6, Arkan
sas 30, California 45, Colorado 70, Connec
ticut 15, Delaware 3. Florida 8, Georgia 50,
Idaho 10, Illinois 50. Indiana 40, lowa 35,
Kansas 60, Kentucky 25, Louisiana

braska 51, Nevada 15, New Jersey 12,
New Yoric 44, North Carolina 70, North

Washington 17, West Virginia 12, Wis
consin 10, Wyoming 15, New Mexico 8,
Utah 20, District of Columbia 4, Indian
Territory 5, Alaska 2.
New YorJt may not be represented in the
National organization since Chairman De
mar failed to issue a call for the State con
vention, he being a Bryan supporter and
feeling that the St. Louis convention will
! have nothing to do but to indorse the
Democratic Presidential nominee. But
Chairman Mott says all the other Eastern
States will be represented and even a regi
ment may yet be drummed up from the
Empire btate ia the big convention next
week.
The growth of the National Silver party
has been rapid. It was organized in
Washington, D. C, oa January 22-23,1896.
A conference of the leading silver men of
the country was held at the National cap
ital on the days named and the organiza
tion of the party was speedily planned and
perfected. As a result of the conference
a National convention was called to meet
in the city of St. Louis on July 22, the
same time the Populist party had already
named for the holding of its convention.
Tne dates of both conventions were fixed
at a later day than those set for tbe con
ventions of the two old parties in order
that the Bimetallists and Populists might
unite on a certain standard-bearer that
could represent their respective interests.
The convention will not deal with any
skle issues. There will be only one plank
in its platform. It will be a silver plank.
It will waive all discussion as to a pro
tective tariff or tariff lor revenue only. In
a preamble just out tbe party declares that
"these and other reforms are committed
to tbe conservative wisdom of Congress
and the executive." On the silver ques
tion this preamble demands that "the
mints of the United States shall be re
opened to equally unrestricted coinage for
gold and silver into unlimited legal tender
money of the United States; the gold to
issue in the present standard gold coins
and the silver to Issue in tbe present
atandajd silver dollar. Depositors of the
gold or silver at trie mint to receive, if
they prefer, in lieu of coin at the coining
value coin certificates, which shall be
redeemed on demand in gold or silver coin
at the option and according to the con
venience of the United States. As a safe
guard against oanicand money stringency
the Secretary of the Treasury shall be
empowered to issue sued coin certificates
additionally against deposits of in
terest-bearing bonds of the United
States, the interest accruing on the
bonds to inure to the United States
pendinp their re-exchange for the coin
certificates, which coin certificates when
returned shall be canceled, provided that
such additional issues of coin certificates
shall not reduce the percentage of coin
and builion reserved for coin certificates
and silver certificates below 60 per cpiu of
the aggregate sum of coin certificates and
silver certificates outstanding. The now
outstanding silver certificates, gold certifi
cates and treasury notes of 1890 to be re
tired as they come into the treasury."

MICHIGAN SILVERITES.
They Declare That the Gold
Standard Is Producing a Stag
nation of Industry.
LANSING, Mich., July 16.â The State
Silver Convention met Here to-day. About
150 delegates were present, including
Greenbackers, Populists, Democrats and
Republicans.
Major Irvine G. Walker was made per
manent chairman. He said he had been
a Republican up to the assembling of the
Chicago convention, but he was no longer
an adherent of that party, because of his
belief that silver should be restored as a
money metal at the ratio of 16 to l, and he
asked all lovers of their country to unite
with him in some arrangement whereby
all silver men could be brought to the
support of one candidate for President
and Congress.
The report of the committee on resolu
tions declared against the gold stan
dard as producing a stagnation of in
dustry, tbe heaping up of enormous inter
est charges on the Government, the issu
ing of bonds in time of peace, the heaping
up of wealth in the hands of the few, the
impoverishment of tbe people, the in
crease of taxes and the obligations of
debtors, and concludes as follows:
Therefore we, the bimetallists of Michigan,
in convention assembled, hereby resolve that
we favor the free and unlimited coinage of
silver and gold at the ratio of 16 to 1, as it ex
isted previous to 1873, by the United States,
independent of any other nation, and all
money minted or issued by the Government
to be a full legal tender in payment of all
debts, both public and private; the Govern
ment to exercise the option to redeem its obli
gations in either silver or gold, as maybe most
convenient. We also favor tbe enactment of a
law that will prohibit the making of contracts
that discriminate against any money issued
by the Government.
The committee on permanent organiza
tion recommended the adoption of the
name of Union Silver party, called for
the appointment of a State|Central Com
mittee and an executive committee of four
members, the latter to con^st of members
who bad formerly acted with the Demo
cratic, Republican, Populist and Prohi
bitionist parties.
The Slate Central Committee was in
structed to confer with tbe Democratic
and Populist parties relative to taking
united action on nominations for State,
legislative and county tickets.
These delegates at large to the conven
tion at St. Louis were elected: John Me-
Elrath, Detroit; O. R. L. Crozier, Wash
tenaw; C. J. Lovey, Grand Ledge; E. E.
Jarvis, Benton Harbor; E. C. Watkins,
lonia; E. A. Reynolds, Inghaui; Charles
H. McGinley, Sanilac; H. E. Light,
Saginaw; C. J. Haddock, Muskegon;
Douglus Rober. Mecosta.
Two delegates from each Congressional
district were also elected.
The delegation will favor the indorse
ment of Bryan and Sewall.

MAKES MANY SPEECHES.
One Little Incident Shows the
Good Will of "Silver
Dick " Bland.
COMPLIMENTS ARE EXCHANGED
Greeted by a Bg Crowd at Kansas
City the Chicago Candidate
Grows Eloquent.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 16.â William J.
Bryan arrived uere from Salem, 111 , at
8:45 o'clock this morning via the Balti
more and Ohio. A sleepy looking crowd,
among whom were Bryan's sister and his
niece*, assembled at Salem station three
hours previously and saw the party off.
At several stations on tne route Bryan
stepped from the train and shook hands
with early risers who had assembled to
greet him.
At Carlyle, 111., where the first stop was
made, about fifty persons gTasped his
band. Mayor Webb headed the contin
gent at Lebanon, 111., and accompanied
the party to Â£t. Louis.
At East St. Louis several hundred peo
ple hact assembled, and their cheers caused
Bryan to step to the platform and make a
brief speech, in which he said he and
Srwall believed in the platform on which
tney stood, aid believed in carrying out
its provisions to the very letter. He
ended by quoting a saying of Bismarck
that the farmers should stand together
and protect themselves from the drones
who produce nothing. He was given a
parting salute by the locomotive whistles.
About 3000 people were assembled at the
depot at St. Louis when Bryan appeared
on the platform. Ha was given three
hearty cheers. In the crowd he became
separated from his wife and children and
mounted a chair. Then the crowd began
clamoring for a speech. Bryan smilingly
replied: "I am looking for that which is
dearer to me than all else â my wife and
children. I would be glad to make a
speech, bnt, like ail other people, I must
eat. Having but a few minutes in which
to satisfy ourselves, I hope you will kindly
excuse me if I do not make a speech."
Breakfast was partaken of in the depot
dining-room and at 9 o'clock Bryan and
bis family left on the Missouri Pacific
for Kansas City.
Hon. Richard P. Bland reached here
from Lebanon ea r ly this morning. He
met Bryan as the train was pulling out.
Their greeting was cordial. Bland went
with the Bryan party as far as Jefferson
City.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., July 16.â
Bryan arrived here at 12:40 p. x. On the
arrival of the train at a little place called
Washington, Bland addressed the crowd.
He said: "I want to introduce to you ihe
next President of the United States. I
served four years with him in tht House
of Representatives. I know he is as true
8 friend of free silver as I am. I want to
say if I I ad the selection of a silver candi
date for the President of the United States
this gentleman would have won my
choice."
Bryan showed some feeling as he re
sponded:
"If this nomination had gone by merit
it would have gone to the man who for
twenty years in the face of great opposi
tion kept alive the silver cause. In the
hour of victory he will be more entitled to
credit than any other man in the Nation."
This incident was repeated at Chambers,
where Bland presented Bryan to about a
hundred people in the same language as
he had used at Washington. Bryan in
turn said : "If my loyalty to the cause of
the people be ever questioned there is no
man on whose certificate I would sooner
rely than upon the certificate of Richard
P. Bland."
SEDALIA, Mo., July 16.â An enthu
siastic crowd was gathered at the little
town of California. In the course of a
minute's speech there Mr. Bryan said : "I
am very glad of the chance to see that the
name of your town is taken from a State
whose silver sentiment ia strong. But I
am hopeful that not only in Calitomia,
but from the Pacific to the Atlantic coast
tiie silver sentiment is L'oing to swÂ«eo tne
country. Reports from the oid Bay State
indicate that when the silver question is
as well discussed there aÂ« it has oeen hern
the silver sentiment will t>e as strong there
as It is in California, Mo."
Ex-Congressman Heard of Missouri and
Charles Van Antwerp, a cousin of Mr.
Bryan's, joined tbe party at California.
At Tipton, where 200 or 300 people
cheered the nominee, Mr. Bryan availed
himself of the opportunity afforded by the
presence of an enterprising vuung man
with a kodak cara-ra to deliver a senti
ment on that question. ' Next to the
pemocratlc form of government," he said,
"the kodak is tbe thing we mosi love."
Of course the crowd lauirhed. Mr. Bryan
male no remarks at Tipton, but s./ook
bands with tbe people.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 16.â The sta
tion at Sedalia was packed with people
when the Bryan train arrived there at 2:55
o'clock. Cheer followed cheer as Mr.
Bryan was recognized. Ex-Congressman
Heard, standing beside Mr. Bryan on the
rear platform, introduced the nominee.
Then there whs more cheering. Mr. Bryan
said:
"In no bther country are we able to see
Bach a sight as is witnessed here. In no
other country are the people so free to
choose those who :or a brief time exercise
the powers of government. In no other
civilized country can it be so truly said
that the Government so justly derives its
powers from the consent of the people.
Here the people govern ; all power rests
with them. It is the greatest form of
government conceived in the mind of
man, and when I see this assemblage, on
such an occasion I cannot but feel the
gratification we ali should nave.
"Parties," continued Mr. Bryan, ''are
bnt the instruments by which "we carry
out those policies which we believe in.
Parties are not to bo worshiped. They
are not perfect. They are but effective
means by which we carry out our pur
poses."
Mr. Bryan again complimented Mr.
Bland.
"If the lot had fallen to him," said be,
"I would have been his most loyal sup
porter. [Cheers.] lam gratified beyond
measure that when the iot fell upon me I
have no trner friend than Richard P.
Bland." [Loud cheers.]
Mr. Bryan berged his auditors to make
their ballots express exactly what they
wished, and he concluded with this re
mark: "I don't want anybody to think
that by voting for me they are going to
get their hands in somebody else's poct
ets. I would be satisfied if I kept the
bands of other people out of their pock
ets." [Cheers and cries of "That's it."]
Mrs. Bryan appeared on the platform
just then, and the crowd which had fre
quently expressed its enthusiasm, cheered
again. Then a mad rush was made for
the platform on which Mr. Bryan was
standing, and handshaking was in prog
ress when the train drew out of the siation
at 3:05.
When the train reached Sedalia Mr.
Bryan was handed a telegram, announc
ing the sudden death of ex-Governor Rus
sell of Massachusetts. He immediately
dictated tno following telegram to Mrs.
Russell at Cambridge, Mass. :
I have just learned of the sudden death of
Governor Russell and hasten to express my
profound sympathy. Your husband's friends
were legion, and they all share yoar sorrow.
W. J. Bryan.
At stations all along the route people
were assembled to see trie Democratic
candidate. At Dresden, Lament, Knob
noster, Centcrview, Holden, Kingsville,
Pleasant Hill, Greenwood and Lee Sum
mitt he was cheered and at a few of them
he spoke briefly.
A large crowd was waiting at Warrens
burg, and in response to their importuni
ties for a speech Mr. Bryan asked if they
were going to be at the polls on election
day. Ttiere was a chorus of "Yes." "All
doubt has passed away," said Mr. Bryan,
and he got cheers and laughter.
He made a few general remarks and
ended with the statement that if some one
else was elected he would support the
Government until he could help change it.
The Third Regiment of tne National Guard
was in camp at Warrensburg and a bat
tery tired a salute.
He made another little speech to the
people gathered at Holden, telling them
that he took their presence there as an in
dication of a realization of the importance
of the campaign, and be believed it would
be one of the greatest campaign* through
which he had ever passed. Mr. Bryan ad
vised his hearers to cast their votes on the
side on which they thought their interests
lay.
A crowd of about 300 greeted Mr. Bryan
at Pleasant Hill, a large number ot them
wearing on their hats pictures of Mr.
Bryan with the inscription. "No crown of
thorns, no cross of pold." Mrs. Bryan
was presented with a large bouquet of
roses. After shaking bands with as many of
the crowd as he couid reach from the rear
platform of the train Mr. Bryan said be
hoped all of them would get into politics
this year. He considered the money
question the most important is*ue cf the
campaign. A number of people thought
it could be sett ed by a few experts, but lie
thought it should be decided by the whole
people.
At Warrensburg Senator F. M. Cockrell
and two reception committees had joined
Mr. Bryan's train.
A great cheer went up from the crowd
at the Union station here when tne train
arrived, and the crowd was so great that a
way for Mr. Bryan was only made with
the greatest difficulty. Mr. and Mrs.
Bryan and the members of their party
were placed in carriages and driven to the
Coates House, where tuey had dinner. At
9 o'clock Mr. Bryan appeared on the
balcony of the hotel and after an introduc
tion by Senator Cockreli addressed the
multitude assembled outside.
The cheering when he appeared was
vigorous and long continued. Tie multi
tude in front of th*> Coatea House crowded
the street and sidewalks and overflowed
into side streets, their number being con
servatively estimated at 60,000. It was
the most enthusiastic and best attended
meeting addressed by Mr. Byran sines his
nomination and he rose to the occasion by
going ;arther into polital discussion than
he had gone in any previous speech. In
concluding he said:
If the gold standard is the standard of civili
zation why ia it that the United States, the
leader in the civilization of the wor;d, has
never declared for a gold standard? [Great
applause.] If the gold standard is toe stand
ard of civilization why ia it that no National
party in the history ot the United Btates has
ever declared that the gold standard is a good
thing T You say tbe Republican party did.
No, it did not. The Republican party declared
that the gold standard should be maintained
until something could be substituted ior it.
And what was that something ? [Lauehter
and applause.] What was that something?
It was bimetallism. And ihey pledged them
selves to get riii of the gold standard and sub
stitute bimetallism as a better thing than a
gold standard. It the gold standard is a good
thing why should we try to get rid of it ? If it
is a bad thing why should we keep it for a sin
gle moment?
We point to the Republican platform as con
clusive evidence that the principle of bimetal
lism is better than tbe principle involved in
the gold standard. And if they attempt to ad
mit that a double standard is oeuter than a
single standard and tell us that this Nation is
impotent to secure it without the aid of other
nations we hurl back defiance and tell them
that this Nation is great enough to legislate
lor its own people without waiting for the aid
or consent of any other nation on earth.
[Thunderous applause.] Which course will
they take? They aare not take either course.
They dare not meet the issue on the money
question, because there is no ground upon
which they can stand. If they nad decUred
for the gold standard they might have edvu
cated It. but having declared against the gold
standard they dare not ask the yerd'.ct of their
countrymen upon this proposition.
Is tbe United State*- able to legislate for itself
ou the most important issue before the coun-<
try? Or must the legislative power be dele
gated to some foreign nation? Must the Amer
ican people surrender the right of self-govern
ment? 1 have no fear of the verdict of the peo
ple. Aye, when we were but 8,000,000 we
were willing then to declare our political In
dependence.
when we are 70,000.000 are we afraid to de
clare our financial independence? Why. in our
patiorm we declare iv favor of the Monroe
doctrine. We are in favor of this Nation pro
tecting the little nation of Venezuela from an
act of wrong. I ask you, are we great enough
to go to South America and protect South
America? Yes, we are; but can we do
that and yet say we are not able to protect
our own people on our own soil? fApplause 1
Well, now. my frieDds, I didn't intend to talk
politics at all, but the presence of this mag
nificent assemblage tempted me to break the
promise I had made, I want to leave tnU sub
ject to be discussed by others and I want to
say one thing. It is not a difficult thing for us
who iive in this Western country, who know
the condition of our peopie. their needs and
their desiresâ it is not a difficult thing for us
to advocate bimetallism; not a difficult thing
for us to ask for the restoration of the free and
unlimited coinage of gold and silver at a 16 to 1
ratio. But there are sections in this country
whereit has required more heroism to stand
out for the rights of the masses of the people.
And I ase you as you assemble to-night not to
forpt that brave man who stands upon the
ticket with me, and who, away off near the
Atlantic shore, has been fighting the battles of
the common peopie as courageously as Bland
nas fought for ii in Missouri [urea; applause];
as courageously as Western advocates of free
coi na?e have fought the battle here
And in your delight over having at last
claimed recognition on the National ticket tor
Western men and Western ideas do not for
one moment allow your enthusiasm to lag.
Do not for one moment forget the patriotism
of Arthur Sewall, who stands tne embodiment
of these principles as wall as those of the West
and South. I &eg you to remember your re
sponsiblllty as citizens. We come not to you
appealing for your votes; they are your own.
You live In a Nation where tne people rule,
where every citizen is a sovereign, yet where no
one cares to wear a crown. We do not come to
appeal to you; we simply come to present dur
itig this campaign our cause. We believe in
it; we believe it is a righteous cause, but wo
submit it to your judgment and all weaskof
you is that each oi you shall study the queÂ»
hon and when you have made up your mmdi
have the courage to do what you l>eiieve to be
right.
Let your ballots, let the ballot of each man
register a free man's will, and tht-n, mjr
friends, whatever may be the result, we shall
accept it in that spirit which rÂ»Â«rvÂ»des Democ
racy. We ehall nccopt it becauss the majomv
of tne people, expressing themselves at the
polls, must be respected: becnuse from their
decision there is no appeal I thank you for
your attention. [Thunderous applause.]
Mr. Bryan then withdrew, but cams
back and told the people that his hands
were sore from grasping other hands to
day, and he requested them to pre-is his
bands eaisy in the recaption 10 follow.
Thousands of people passed through the
lobby and got a glimpse of the candidate.
Judge Holman dominated.

at my home my comrades in the Civil War.
The ties of fraternity and friendship grow
stronger and dearer as the years recede and
the old guard one by one is called home. Your
presence revives many patriotic memories,
ma:iy stirring mid glorious events. How
vividly they rise before us and what an in
spiration for the ri^ht they always are. To nave
been a faithful soldier of the Union is no leva
a source of joy in yonr advancing years and
infirmities than a legacy for family and
friends. It blesses him wno gives and en
riches him who receives. It is a record of
patriotism and service in tbe severest trials of
our history. [Applause]
We all know something of what that war
meant and what it costs; what sacrifice it ex
acted and for what a holy cause the sacrifice
was freely givenâ treasure illimitable, suffer
ing indescribable and death beyond previous
record or comparison. By far the larger num
ber of our old comrades of the Grand Army
are sleeping in their silent tents beyond the
river, but though death has decimated our
rants, ft is a consoling reflection that mora
than a million of our comrades still survive.
It is a gratifying thought that those who
served their country best in war have always
been among our best and truest citizens in
peace. It is in the living present, however,
and its duties and responsibilities that every
soldier ia now, as always, most deeply inter
ested. [Applause.]
Each new engagement of the war brought
its new trials and perils, and tney were
bravely overcome. The devotion to discipline
and duty which distinguished them then has
kept the soldiers true and steady ever since.
[Applause.]
They have not faltered and will not falter
now. There has been no time since they laid
down their arms when we had greater need
for patriotic men than now, and the response
to the crisis of the power will come from all
sections of our common country. [Great ap
plause.] We have reached a point in our his
tory when all men who love their country
must unite to defeat by their ballots the
forces which now assault the country's honor.
The struggle which is upon' us, involving
National good faith and honor, will enlist
their united and earnest services until tho.>e
who are arraigned against the public faith
â hail be routed and dispersed, Tbe bitterness
of the war belongs to tbe past. Its glories are
the common heritage of us all. What was won
in that great conflict belongs just as sacredly
to those who lost as those who triumphed.
You meet to-day not m soldiers, but as citizens
interested now in maintaining the credit and
honor of tbe country you served so well and
in restoring prosperity apd better times to our
goodly heritage.
The future is the sacred trust of us all, South
as well as North. Honesty, like patriotism,
can neither be bounded by Btate nor sectional
lines. [Great applause.] FtnancUl dishonor
is the threatened danger now, and good men
will obliterate old Unas of party in a united
effort to uphold American honor. This you
have always done, and you must strive to
keep the Union wortny of the brave men who
sacrificed and died for it. I will be glad, my
comrades, to meet you all personally, [uoud
cheering and applause.]

ST. ADELAIDE DE PABOS, Quebec,
July 16. â William Eustis Russeii, the
thrice Governor of Massachusetts, who
was prominently mentioned for the Demo
cratic nomination for the Presidency be
fore tbe silver feeling became so pro
nounced in his party, died suddenly in a
little fishing-camp in the woods near the
settlement of Little Pabos some time I
during last night or in tbe early hours of
this morning.
Heart failure was the probable cause of
bis death, which came without warning to
himseii or friends. He had not a symp
tom of illness up to the time be retired for
the night. That his death was painless
was shown by the position of the body
when foujid and the expression on his
face.
Governor Russell, his brother, Henry E.
Russell, and Colonel Francis Peabody
of Boston arrived at Little Fabos yester
day for a few days' fishing. They pitched
their camp in the woods near tbe settle
ment. Their tent was divided into two
rooms, one of winch was occupied by the
Governor and the other by Henry Russell
and Colonel Peabody. The party retired
early as they intended to start about day
light for the fishing-place.
Colonel Peabody and Henry Russell
were astir early, and were surprised that
the Governor had not put in an appear
ance when they were reaciy to start. They
went to call him, and were horrified at
finding him dead. The Coroner was im
mediately notified, and will hold an in
quest. The remains will then be taken to
hi 3 late home in Boston.
Little Pabos, where Governor Russell
died, iies near the entrance to the bay of
Chaleur, a large inlet ol the Gulf of St.
Lawrence. It has always been a favorite
resort for salmon fishermen. It is reached
by a small steamer from Quebec.
STORY OF RUSSELL'S LIFE
AÂ© One Erer Talked With Him Who Did
Hot Go Away If,* Friend.
The death of William Enstis Russell in
the prime of a noble manhood that was
full of still loftier promise will be re
gretted not only in New 'â  England, where
he was a popular idol, but throughout the
Nation, which only a few weeks ago beard
his name , coupled with .a ; possible can
didacy for the highest office within the
gift of the people. '.
.â His career was ; a remarkable one. Not
yet 40 years of age be was honored as, not
many men have been during a long life
time. Born at Cambridge in 1857, he at
tended the public schools there and en
tered colleee at tba age of 10. Graduating
from Harvard in ' 1877, Russell entered the
law school of : the Boston University and
left that institution three years later at the
nead of his class. Shortly after this his
Public life ocgan. 'The intellectual town
ol Cambridge, chose him t for one of \ its
Councilmen and then " promoted him to
the Mayoralty. As Mayor he served four
successive . terms, '; and 1 ; so:, distinguished
â¢were his .services,- so- great his success: in
that office, that by common consent he
was made the choice of his party for the
chief magistracy of Massachusetts.
It seemed to be bis fate to lead forlorn
hopes and his successes were astonishing
even to himself. He had an excellent
command of oratory, was devoted to the
interests of the people and he attracted
men to him. An admirer has said of him
that "No one ever talked with Russell
who did not go away his friend."
An incident in Russell's first term as
Mayor is thus related by Hon. Samuel
Roads of Massachusetts, formerly Rus
sell's private secretary:
"He was only 27 years old when he was
brought face to face with the great crisis j
of his life. It was an emergency wuich 1
should make or mar him, before which i
many an older and more experienced but j
less courageous man would have quailed.
Then was a great strike of streetcar em- â¢
ployes. I have forgotten the merits of the !
controversy, whicn is immaterial, but I J
remember tilings began to assume a very
j ugly look; the strikers were defiant; it
I looked for a time as if the civil authority
was to be mocked at. The strikers were
stubborn and refused to listen to reason;
the company would not tolerate the
thought of compromise.
"Russell, 'the boy Mayor,' the youneest
Mayor ever elected in Massachusetts and
perhaps the youngest in the country, de
termined to settle the strike, and, what is
more wonderful, he settled it in such a
manner that both sides were satisfied, the
strikers as well as the company. This
action not only won him the confidence
of the people of the city, but attracted to
him the attention of the entire State, and
showed that he had something besides
youth and eloquence and personal mag
netism at his command."
His appearance was decidedly boyish
when, in 1888, be received the Democratic
nomination for Governor, and his oppon
ents made light of the youngster. He was
i beaten that year aud ran again tbe next
j year, but once more a Republican was
elected. Once more in 1890 he headed the
ticket. The campaign he made that year
was a wonderful one. He spoke night
after night for months, and met on the
stump men of National reputations and
whose names were household words. Rus
| sell was elected. It is a remarkable thing
that during the three years he held office
as Governor, with a sinele exception, every
Republican on the State ticket, saving
only tbe head, was elected, so that while
the Governor was a Democrat, every other
official, from the Secretary of State down,
was a Republican. The sole exception
during those three years was the election
of a Democratic Auditor. But Russell
maintained friendly relations with his sub
ordinate officials, and, political considera
tions apart, they all entertained for him a
sincere liking.
Wbiie in business and political matters
> Mr. Russell was cold, calculating and in- 'â 
j tensely self-contained, he was a man of
naturally warm impulses and eenerous
instincts. During his tenure of tbe guber- j
natorial office he was constantly doing
kind and graceful things, which, if known,
i would have helped him in a great many
ways, but he studiously avoided publicity, j
"I remember," Mr. Roads said, "that j
I one of the elevator men in the State House
met with an accident and broke his arm.
Every morning for some days after that
when the Governor came into his office he
brought with him a basket, which during
the course of the morning disappeared. |
j He said nothing to me about the basket, j
I but my curiosity was aroused, and I found |
that the basket contained nourishing food
and other things for 'Tom,' ti e elevator
man, and that every day in the quietest
and most unobtrusive manner the Gov
ernor sent the basKet to the sufferer.
"I remember another incident showing
his goodness of heart. On his second in
j auguration, after the ceremonies were
! over, he went into the council chamber,
! which was magnificently decorated with
flowers. There was one basket finer than
j all the rest. The Governor looked at it a
I minute and then paid: "I wish you would
| jump into a carriage and take these flow
ers to Frank (the Governor's stenograpDer,
who was sick at (be time) and find out
how be is getting along.' It was a little
thing, and yet how many other men at
such a time would have thought of bis
: sick stenographer?"
While Mr. Russell was Governor there
I lived in Essex County, Mass., an old lady,
| a life-long friend of the family, who was
lin indifferent circumstances, but who
| formerly had been well off. Every
â  Thanksgiving day he sent to her coal
i enough for the entire winter, a bountiful
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 17, 1896.
supply of provisions and a good-sized
check. Every Christmas Mrs. Russell and
himself used to seek out all the poor chil
dren ol Cambridge who otherwise would
not have much occasion to rejoice in the
coming of the glad season, assemble them
in a great barn and j;ive them presents,
warm clothing and make them have a
good time generally. The Governor en
joyed these parries immensely, and his
oldest child, Eustis, a beautiful boy, acted
the part of Santa Claus.
As Governor he was more desirous of
doing what he thought to be right and for
the best interests of the State than to
profit personally or for his party. He was
never afraid to face a situation.
He was twice re-elected Governor, and
in 1892 was favored by the Massachusetts
Democracy for the Presidential nomina
tion. He was a favorite of the young
men of bis State. One reason why the
young men always stood by him was that
he did the things young men like. He
rode like a centaur, loved to shoot, hunt,
fish, dance, play lawn tennis and football.
After leaving the governorship Mr.
Russell devoted his time to the law. He
was not a rich man, although in com
fortable circumstances. He wasessentially
a domestic man. In Cambridge he lived
in a comfortable but unpretentious house,
happy in the society of his wife and
children.
At the late Democratic convention in
Chicago the Massachusetts delegation
would have been proud to put forward
the name of William E. Russell for the
Presidential nomination, but they were
forced to repudiate the platform of that
body, and one of the last acts of the de
ceased in public life was to plead before
that convention for reasonable action that
would not drive conscientious men from
the party rants.
Governor Russell concluded his speech
in opposition to th; adoption of the plat
form as follows:
I have heard from the lips of some of the old
leaders of our party at whose feet we younger
men have loved to learn the principles of our
faith, that this new doctrine was the bright
dawn of a better day. I would to God that I
could believe it. I have heard that Democracy
was being tied to a starâ not the lone star, my
Texas friends, that we gladly would welcome
but to the falling: star, which flashes for an
instant ana then goes out in the darkness of
the night. No, my friends, we see not the
dawn, but the dr.-kness of deteat and disaster.
Oh, that from this great majority, with its
power, there might come the one word of con
cession and conciliation.
Oh, that from yon there might be held out
the olive branch of peace, tinder which all
Democrats, united, could rally to a great vic
tory. Mr. Chairman, I have finished my work
of protest. Let me, following the example of
the Senator from South Carolina, utter my
word of prophecy. When this storm has sub
sided, when the dark clouds of passion and
prejudice have rolled away, and there comes
after the turmoil of this convention the 6ober
second thought of Democrats and of our
people, then the protests we of the minority
| here make will be hailed as the arch of the
covenant of the faith where all Democrats,
j reunited, may go to fight for the old principles
j and carry them to triumphant victory.
He bad high hopes when he went to
Chicago; but they were bl anted, and it is
just possible that, had it not been for that
convention, William Â£. Russell would be
alive to-day.
An affecting incident that tells of shat
tered hopes was related by a correspond
ent of The Call in a telegram from the
Chicago convention. It was in the scene
that followed the nomination of Bryan.
There were two women on the platform.
One was the wife of the nominee; the
other, Mrs. William E. Russell. The
former was happy and her lace was
radiant Mrs. Russell, whose whole spirit
had been with her husband's aspirations,
sat there weeping as if her heart would
break. The story of the victor and the
vanquished was told by those smiles and
tears. It is possible that. Russell, too,
went away from that convention heart
broken.

ACTION IN KENTUCKY.
State Officers Propose to Compel
the Company to Obey the
Law.
FRANKFORT, Kt., July 16.â The State
officers are after tbe Southern Pacific Rail
road Company with a sharp stick, and the
big corporation which has been doing
business in California on the charter
passed by the Kentucky Legislature will
have to pay taxes to the State or will have
one of the hottest tights in the courts, fol
lowed by united efforts of the State offi
cials to effect the repeal of its charter.
Auditor Stone has been investigating
the matter under the personal supervision
cf Assistant Auditor Frank H. Johnson,
and this morning called on Attorney-Gen
eral W. S. Taylor, who is now looking into
tbe legal phases of the case.
Assistant Auditor Jolinson this morning
received a letter from County ClerE John
son of Jeffertou County asking advice as
te the tax the road should pay. He said j <
an officer of tbe road had called at his
orh'ce to pay a broker's license. He stated
that the road had paid $150 as a license in j
1834, but that they had paid no taxes for â¢
1895. and wanted to know if the big fran- j
chise was to acquit its debt with the State
with tbe pittance of this broker's license.
Section 7 of the charter provides for a
tax on all tangible property and stocks
and for taxes as other raiiroads pay and a '
broker's license in addition. The road
has practically paid no taxes. Tbe new
revenue law passed in 1892 provides for a
franchise tax and is sufficiently sweeping
in its terms to reach this corporation,
and the tax when fixed by the State Board
of Valuation and Assessment would
amount to about $100,000 per annum.
It is through this board that the road j
will be 'cached and will confront giant!
combatants should it attempt to evade on
a technicality the plain letter of tbe law.
Auditor Stone said to The Call corre
spondent :
"I have not answered Clerk Johnson's
letter, but it is my opinion the road should
deal directly with my office. They have
not pai'i tbe tax and it is due and ahould {
be paid. I shall certainly demand that !
they comply with the plain letter of the '
law."
Attorney-General Taylor was then called
in consultation and the matter laid before
him. General Taylor immediately called
up Clerfc Johnson at Louisville by tele
phone and aaked him for a written state
ment of the amount of taxes the road had
paid to tbe State together with the name
of the agent and all other facts necessary
to set about bringing the proper procedure.
This will be received by Taylor to-morrow
and be and Auditor Stone have an engage
ment to discuss the matter before bringing
it np before the State Board of Valuation
and Assessment for rating.
General Taylor said to The Call corre
! spondent: "I cannot say just what action I
! will take until I have an official communi
cation from the road and they refuse to
pay the tax. I am investigating the
matter thoroughly and the road has not
been complying with the law. I will most
assuredly see that they do this."
There is a constitutional provision that
the Southern Pacific charter people have
have no knowledge of. This will strike
terror to them when they are confronted
with it in court. It was said by a promi
nent State officer that unless the road com
plied with the revenue law the matter
would be made a political question and
members of the Legislature pledged to
vote for its repeal. General Taylor is tak
ing every precaution in preparing his state
ment for the auditor and the Board of
'Valuation and Assessment.

The driver, miscalculating the height of
tbe wagon, attempted to drive throuph
the Fort Wayne bridge. The bridge proved
too low, however, and when the anver
saw his mistake he was unable to stop tbe
horses. They dragged the wagon in, and
the occupants were either scraped off or
crushed between the wagon and the
bridge.
It was at first reported that five or sir
of the occupants of the wagon were killed
or fatally hurt. Feller, agent of the show,
says: "Four of our musicians were irulu
fully injured, and two will probably die.
The* others were not seriously hurt. We
do not know how the driver miscalculated
the height of the bridge or how the horses
were beyond his control."

MODEL IN ALL RESPECTS
Difficult Task of Making Good
Citizens Out of Quasi
Criminals.
MBS. MITCHELL IS ASTOUNDED.
Punishment of Rhoda Webb Described
by Miss V. A. 01 instead, the
Girls' Principal.
Los Axgklm Office of The Call,)
123)4 West Second street, V
Los Angeles, Cal., July 16.)
An afternoon newspaper here to-day re
printed the matter contained in The Call
of yesterday regarding the investigation of
the Whittier State School. W. C. Patter
son's attention was called to it by the local
paper's reporter, whereat this trustee
wrote in part as follows:
In my judgment, tbe Whittier State School
wa.a never in so good a condition, morally, as
now; its supplies were never purchased so
economically; its business affairs have never
bean more carefully and systematically admin
istered; its general discipline was never bet
ter, and it has never in its entire history done
better work, than it is now doing in the way of
making good citizens out of quasi criminals,
notwithstanding occasional discouragements
and unwarranted attacks upon the manage
ment.
A Call correspondent showed this state
ment to Mrs. Mitchell, who said:
"Of all of the many statements which
have emanated from Mr. Patterson's pen
this is the most astounding. I shall enter
into no controversy with Mr. Patterson.
This statement has decided me to let the
public know just what was testified to by
the different witnesses, and the pabhc can
judge for itself."
The testimony which follows was taken
at an official meeting of the board con
ducted by Trustees Patterson and Mitchell
and written out by F. H. McAllister, offi
cial court reporter, all the witnesses hav
ing been duly sworn by a notary before
testifying. The following are extracts of
the stenographic report, selected impar
tially from tbe 400 pages of the record by
The Call representative:
Miss V. A. Olmsteacl, principal of the girls'
department, who did the whipping and who
is accused of the excessive punishments,
testifies:
Q.â You may state, if you please, just in your
own language, and in your own way, the cir
cumstances leading up to it and all about it.
Yon may state when it was, as nearly as you
can, and the various circumstances. A.â Well,
I can't think of the day now. If yon will let
me loot at my whipping record I can tell you.
Qâ Why, certainly. (Witness examines rec
ord.) A.â On May 22, 189 G. I whipped Rhoda
Webb. I gave her ten strokes across the
shoulders. The girl had been very impudent
and insolent to Miss Jackson, who we were
having as substitute at the time.
Q.â What did you whip her with? A.â A
strap.
Qâ A leather strap? A.â A leather strap
that we have here for that purpose. Bhe had
been giving her a great of trouble, and when
in thÂ« dining-room, or whenever she would
take the gills to the plungeroom, getting
ready lor meals and washing, etc., she was in
subordinate and seemed determined not to do
as she wanted her to do, and she would stir up
the other girls toâ well, 1 might say, to
mutiny.
Mrs. Mitchellâ But that wasn't the cause of
the whipping. That wasn't what you whipped
her for? A.â Yes; it was partially that.
Q-â What was the other cause? A.â Then,
aside from that, she created a disturbance in
the plungeroom when Miss Jackson had the
girls in charge. I did not find it out right
away, but n came out right along that she
helped to make the other girls disobedient and
was tbe ringleader in making queer noises
and beipg disrespectful to Miss Jackson.
Q.â That came out after the whipping? A.â
Oh, no.
Q.â You whipped her that day, the same day
she committed the offense? A.â YeÂ». I
whipped her in the mornine, and I think the
offense was committed the night before, but it
had been going on for sometime. It was not
Just that one time that she had been to the
plunge.
Qâ lt was not exactly for the disobedience
in the plunge altogethe r ? A.â l l waa not alto
gether that. It was general insubordination
and hatefulnevs and the very ugly manner in
which she treated the officer in charge; but
that was the thing that brought it on directly,
her demeanor In the plunge.
Q.â Were you alone when yon her that
whipping? A.â No; I am never Â«^oÂ«e when I
give a whipping.
Q-â Who was with you? A.â Mrs. Slyder, the
matron.
Q-â The whippings that are given yotj pre
scribe yourseli? A.â We never v]i]p except
with my permission.
Q.â And do you give permission? A.â l give
permission,
Q.â To have them whipoed? A.â Why, if a
child needs whipping and it is an unusual
case, I generally ao it myself, but if it is bo
that I think it would bÂ« better lor the officer
to do it I have her do it.
Q.â But you don't prescribe it yourself*
You don't get your authority for doing that
from anybody else? You generally do that
yourself? A.â As a general thing. As & gen
eral thing I take the thing in hand; but tnen
I have authority for so doing from the super
intendent.
Q.â At the time for each whipping? A.â No.
Q.â l mean when you whip you simply do
not consult him, but you just simply whip at
your owa discretion? A.â At my own discre
tion; yes.
Mr. Pattersonâ How severely did you whip
this girl? A.â l took the strap and soaked it
until it was soft and flexible. The strap Is a
hard, stiff thing when it is dry.
Q.â How long did you soak it; do you know?
Aâ Why, I soaked it five or ten minutes to
soften it. It would be very severe if ye would
lay it on the bare skin dry.
Mrs. Mitchellâ Don't you think It would be a
little more so after being wet? A.â No; it
stings more, but it is not so hard, upon the
flesh.
Mr. Pattersonâ At the conclusion of the whip
ping did you notice any marks or bruises? A.â
I looked at her back. I always do. Her back
was red. but there were no bruises. It was
very red. It was reddened all over where I had
whipped her. I gave her ten strokes.
VJ.â About down to her waist or from her
sbonlders down? A.â WelL perhaps not so
low as the waist, I should not think. More
across the shoulders and across the shoulder
blades.
Q.â Did she make any outcry? JLâ No
Mrs. Mitchell: Q.â She didn't cry? A.â She
shed a few tears, 1 gueu, bat she made no
outcry.
Qâ Didn't struggle, or anything of the sort?
A.â fto. I gave hei the whipping, one strap at
a time, when she was ready for it, and told her
when she got ready for the next oaÂ« to tell me,
and when she was ready tor tbe next one I
gave it-
Q. Did she stand still while yon gave It?
Q.-ia*ny position at till A.-Bh.e leased
over not very far. It was in the pluugeroom,
and we bavo those chairs around there where
they -wash, and she put her hands on each
fide of that. She is tall, and leaned over some
Q.â ls she a stout girl? A.â She is a very,
large girl, tallâ taller than I am.
Q.â You gave her only tan strokes? A.â
That is all.
Q.â Just ten? A.â That is all.
Q.â Did you whip her any more or any Jess
severely than your ordinary whippings? A. â
Well I should say it was about an average
whipping.
Mr. Pattersonâ Let me ask rigbt here for my
information, because I didn't examine those
places. When girls are put in solitary confine
ment is there not provided a certain place?
What is the nature of the place? How long is
the room? Just tell about it.
Mrs. Mitchellâ l was going to suggest we
have a look at the plnce.
Mr. Pattersonâ We can go in and see It to
night or to-morrow, perhaps. A.â lt is a room.
There are two rooms. We have two of these
rooms, and each is about the size of this' one
from the door I should think and wider.
Q.â What have you in them? A.â That would
be about twelve feet squareâ nearly twelve feet
tquare.
Q.â What have you in them in the way of
conveniences? A.â There is a hot and cold
water faucet and a marble washstand and a
patent watercloset, just the same as we have
in our toilet-room.
Q.â And the bed? A. â We have no bedstead
in there. We did use to have a bedstead, but
they used it to get oat with, and we had to
take it out, and, I think, just about five com
forters. I guess the girl is in there now; we
just have about five comforters, and she
spreads those down that she wants to lie on
and usos the others for covers.
Mrs. Mitchellâ And Iks on the floor? A.â
Yes, right on the floor.
Q.â ls there a'window? A.â There is a large
window with a screen and curtain like that,
and also a large window over the door. Out
side is a porch.
Q.â A window like that in thJa room? A.â
Yes, it does not come down so low. It ex
tends about as high as the upper bcreen there,
or about as low.
Qâ They could not climb up to that? A.â Oh,
yes. they get up and sit in the windows.
Q.â And there are bÂ«rs across it, of course?
A. â Outside there are strip* of iron. In the
first place there were bars and they were just
set in tbe mortar and could be taken right out,
to we had to put them out.
Q â These bars are put in the ground up and
down as grating? A.â Yes; not grating, but
strips of iron. 1 guess, go across that. There is
one window and than there is an outside door
leading down in a court. I don't let them out
there, because the court is insecure; but over
the door there is a transom.
Q.â With gratinsr-bars over itT A.â Yes, it
has grating over it.
Q.â There is ventilation? A.â Yei, and in
the door that leads into the room there is a
door with on the inside and a little
place in there about tbat size.
Mr. Pattersonâ Well, then, they are not
really uncomfortable there outside of the fact
of being alone? A.â Xo, sir.
Mrs. Mitchellâ And without a bed. Did you
say they used to have a bed and you took it
out? How does the girl get up in tne window?
A.â They don't use it to crawl up with. They
used it for a leverage. You knew those iron
bedsteads all unscrew. They used them for
crowbars and one of them would punch a hole
in a wall in a few minutes. There are two of
those rooms which are furnished in the same
fashion.
Qâ What food had they? A.â Only bread and
water. Each girl has towels and soap and a
piece of sapolio and a cloth to scrub the floor
with if she wants to and a broom to sweep out
and a dustpan.
Q.â How long do you usually keep girls in
there? A.â For running away they stay there
four weeks.
Q.â Just on bread and water? A.â Just on
broad and water and occasionally a lemon or
some fruit and an orange or some onions or
something of that sort. We don't give them
those things every day though.
Q.â Just bread and water? A.â Just bread
and water.
Q- â Well, sometimes they sre whipped and
put iv there as well? A-â Yes; we used 10
whip them for running away.
Q.â And put them in there as well? A.â Yes.

Bezirk Turnfest to be held on August 8 to
the 11th. The affair promises to be one of
the biggest events ever witaessed in this
city and the enthusiasm is equally great
among the American population.
A short time ago invitations were sent
to all the German societies in California
and Oregon and the most of these invita
tions were accepted. The number of
members alone amounts already to 2500.
This does not include any relatives or
friends that may accompany them. There
lore it is not an exaggeration to say that
the number of strangers who will visit
Santa Cruz during that great celebration
will be at least 5000, if not more.
The importance of this turnfest is not
restricted to the local verein alone, but
San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento,
Oakland, Stockton, Napa and Marysyiile
have their respective interests in it.
The turnfest is an annual celebration of
the Pacific Turn Bezirk and this district
includes all the cities here mentioned.
The work accomplished by the execu
tive committee, which consists of Conrad
Flacb (president), A. E. Rodel (secretary),
L. "Wesseudorf, F. K. Walti, John' Wagner,
T. Kron. Robert Effey, George A. Bram,
L. Doeltz, Carl B9CK and S. J. Strauss, is
remarkable, and that success will be a
necessary consequence of such enthusi
asm is an undisputed fact.
The City has promised the Turners its
hearty co-operation and has gone so far
to show its appreciation as to volunteer
the arrangement of the exercise and en
tertainment of tbe euests on Tuesday, Au
gust 11.
The programme chows in its entirety
a magnificence and knowledge of enter
tainments that will no doubt draw big
crowds to witness the festival.
Saturday evening, August 8, will be de
voted to the reception of tne visitors, who
will be escorted through the city in a
torchlight procession. Mayor Clark will
deliver tbe address of welcome.
On Sunday morning the Turners and

various singing societies and instrumental
selections.

o'clock prize swimming will take place in
the Santa Cruz Bay. The exercises on the
grounds will consist of prize shooting,
fencing, bicycle races, concert, dance and
various other amusements.

i such as news items, advertising and print-
I ing, when addressed to him will be cheer
fully answered.
Tne Southern Pacific Railroad Company

for eight days, but F. R. Walti, the presi
dent of the local verein, will go to Ban
Francisco and try to obtain a still lower
rate.
Large posters were ordered to be printed
! and will be distributed throughout the
| State. There is, no doubt, that the Tarn
j feÃt will be a grand success and Santa
Cruz will be packed with jolly Germans
for four days.
The turnfest is intended at the same
time for a singing tournament, and there
fore it is very mnch desired that as many
singers as possible attend. There will be

FORGER SWINDLES CHICO.
He Secures a Couple of Watches and a
Bicycle and Rides Out of Town
on the Wheel.
CHICO, Cal., July 16âOn Tuesday
evening a stranger about 30 years of age,
giving his name as Gay, went into the
jewelry store of E. Meybeil and asked to
see some watches. The flerK in the store
showed him several of the timepieces of
different prices. After selecting a valu
able gold one the stranger told Mr. Dor
rett, the clerk, that he was employed on
the ranch of P. M. Guinn and wanted to
know if an order on that gentleman would
be accepted for the w.atch. Mr. Dorrett,
knowing Mr. Guinn, said that it would.
Gay said that he would be in again and
take the watch.
On the same evening the man went into
the hardware store of Hulibard, Earl &
Co.. and, after looking at some bicycles,
asked Mr. Mecurn the price of a certain
wheel. On being told he asked if tbey
would accept an order on Mr. Guinn for
the amount, and the reply being satisfac
tory, he closed the bargain and said lie
would call next day for the wheel.
The same man also called on H. D. Bur
roughs, a jeweler, and played the sÂ»me
pame on him, securing a watch valued at
$36.
True to his word, he again called at the
stores of Mr. Meybeil and Hubbard, Earl
& Co., presented the orders and secured
the watch and bicycle. The merchants,
not being suspicious, waited tiil Mr.
Guinn cime into town to-day, and that
gentleman, on being told of the orders,
pronounced them forg-ries.
The matter was promptly placed in the
hands of a Constable, who is now looking
after Gay, and in all probabilities he will
be captured, for it was only 8 o'clock tins
morning when he was seen leaving town
on his wheel.
OBJECT SILVER LESSON,
A Colima Survivor Who Has a
Few Dollars for Sa ] c at
a Bargain.
Interesting Figures That Will Bear
Careiul Perusal at This Par.
ticular Time.
SEATTLE, Wash., July 16.â j. E. Chil
berg, one of the survivors of the Coliraa
disaster, returned to Seattle laÂ»t night on
the steamshiD Transit. About three
months ago he shipped from this city to
South American, ports a lot of merchan
dise, for which he received in exchange
3800 Chilean and Peruvian silver dollars.
So much cheap money, the possessor says.
is rather a burden, and ac is just now in
quest of some free-silver advocates, being
anxious to sell his dollar* at 30 cents a
piece upon a guarantee that they contain
more silver of eqnal fineness Der dollar
than one of the United States issues.
Guatemala, he says, is paying gold in
te re*>t on a one million dollar loan made
ten years ago, and in order to procure the
yellow metal with which to make the in
terest payment Mr. Chiiberg says they
have to give 206 silver dollars for $100 in
gold, and that Salvador has to put up $235
in silver for $100 in gold.
According to Chiiberg the coffee-planter
is the man wuo now enjoy himself under
the free-Bilver regime. He hires his men
for the same he did years aeo. but he gets
gold for bis coffee and then buys cheap
dollars with it to pay off his employes.
For his coffee he gets i-old srnd with'the

SHE DIES,
Continued from Flrtt Page.
me and grinding heard throughout the
ship. Every rod, beam and stanchion
voiced the groanings of her agony. The
tops of the long tables in the grand saloon
beenn to rise and fall like the surface of
the swelling sea, and the wooden parti
tions of the cabin to unjoint at their
angle?. Outside in their boats the Fort
Point iife-saving crew and the men in the
ship's lifeboat hung on to their lines, and
were ready to receive all hands if her baefc
should breafc and the fractured bull roll
off into deep water.
The reporter was not so easy in his mind
as were the men who sat on the revolving
chairs in the saloon and told stories of the
good times they had enjoyed on shore.
They had been to sea all their lives except
at rare intervals, but they never spoke of
their shipwrecks, gailore seldom speak of
the never ending perils of reef and gale.
Probably such affairs are a part of the moÂ«
notonyof their lives, andtheir love for
adventure and excitement leads them to
thoughts of farms, livestock and flowery
fields.
They talked on as they waited for the
straining bulkheads to burst, the dynamo
to drown and the electric lights to go out.
Incidently they waiied for the steamer to
go, as they uuietly predicted, "the next
roll like that."
Many of the officers and crew had blank
ets, as they knew should the steamer be
abandoned, they would take refuge aboard
the schooner Jewell, which was anchored
near by. Most of their personal effects had
been sent cff to other vessels earlier. One
man had his three green parrots perched
on his arm, and another was putting in
his time waiting for the final smashing
roll, gropinc around in the gloom of the
pitching decks and euterooms for the
ship's cat. Thowas had sailed in that
vessel for two years, and he was not to be
left when even the rats he hated would
get out of the crumbling steamer.
A lew rcinutes after 10 o'clock Captain
Clark, who had been standing near the
wheelhouse, noticed that the bumping
began farther aft and that tnÂ« hull was
striking harder.
The danger seemed increasing, so he
gave the long-expected order to take to the
boats. The men started for the gangway.
A number of them had gone to sleep in
their bunks, notwithsiandine the peculiar
state of affairs, and they were quickly
i aroused. Several, somewhat dazed by
] the sudden call from slumber, went into
j the boats without their shoes, and one fel
! low brought off a pillow in lieu of a
blanket. Although the ship was dipping
her starboard gangplank half under the
water and the boats were tossing on the
violent swell alongside, with their crews
struggling hard to keep from being
j swamped, there was not the slightest ex
citement or confusion. The steamer would
roll away, lifting ncr bilge high in the air,
then come back as though she would top
ple over, till the rail went far down in the
1 sea.
Almost the last member of the ciew to
leave was the cat. He was found in a
storeroom intently watching a ratbole, the
occupant of which was probably also get
ting ready to desert the ship. The per
sistent feline objected with all the power
of his throat and glawi to being forced out
of the vessel Â«nd yelled and SDit desper
ately as his well-wishing captor dragged
him ungracefully by the tail ioto the
boat.
After the tnen had ail left the ship, the
captain came down the gangway and
silently seated himself on a thwart among
bis crew. They pulled out from the
steamer, leaving her to wallow alone on
the reef, her lamps gleaming cheerfully
from the many cabin windows. Out on
the point the great revolving light swept
solemnly round and round, tossing its
Uame over the land, over the sea, over
the ship that is forever beyond the need
of its warning.
They didn't talk much in the boats, but
sat looking back at the black body of the
deserted steamer. Presently the lights
from the windows went out. The water
had drowned the dynamo and no spark
came from the dead armature.
Aboard the little Jewel the castaways
bivouackedjin the hold. Several bales of
hay, destined for fenders when the
schooner should go alongside of the
steamer, were opened, and in this extem
poraneous mow they wrapped their
blankets around them and slept like true
sailors.
At daybreak the ship was seen yet
whole rolling on the rockt but deeper ia
the water. They manned the boats, and
returning found the engine and fire rooms
awash. The sea had burst through new
holes nearer the stern and the weight of
the water was holding her closer to the
rtef. In consequence she was more stable.
The small donkey engine which is high
above the Hooded compartments was yet
warm and its steam soon heated coffee for
the men. The pantries yielded a generous
supply of eatables and the old ship not
only received them back, but fed them on
their return.
The ill-fated Colombia is none the less
"Â«oic g ," aa they call it, for her bottom is
completely crushed and the rocks that
pierce her are supporting the shattered
hull. While the sea remains quiet she
will hang together, but when tbe great
swells swing furiously into that half
circling cove she will strew the beach with,
her fragments, good ship-bound in triple
steel as she is.^ Tom Gregory.

JIMENEZ HAS A FRIEND.
Consul Calderon Has a Good
Word to Say for the
Young Fellow.
General Ezeta Is Tired of Being
Questioned en the Politics
of Saivador.
Far from abating, interest in the Ezeta-
Jimenez case seems on the increase. Noth
ing else is talked of in Spanish- American
social circles, and widely variant are the
comments pro and con.
Dr. Eustorjio Calderon, the present Con
snl of Salvador in this City, seems to take
great umbrage at certain remarks of Gen
eral Ezeta.
"Of course," be remarked yesterday,
"his Excellency as we see him here is quiet
and lawÂ»abiding, but the real Don Carlos
Ezeta, at the zenith of his powerâ ah !he
was another man. He tajces it upon himself
to criticize my attitude tpward Jimenez.
I had better make a brief statement of the
oase and let it drop : On Tuesday, the day
after the trouble, Don Antonio Martinez
and Don Eladio Castillo, friends and com
patriots of Jimenez, and capitalists of
some note, came to my office, stating that
they had been sent by Jimenez, who was
umier arrest. As in official duty bound, I
went with them to the City Hall.
"Meanwhile, Jimenez haÂ«t sent for his
man of business. John T. Wright, Consul
of Honduras, who had bailed him out. He
had already gone when I arrived at tbe
City Hall. A Uttle later 1 whs notified
that Jimenez was aram undur arrest. A
Mr. Kavanuutih. an employe of Mr.
Wriglit, and I, with ex-Judse Sullivan,
wtnt to the City Hail again, and after
some ado Drocured hja release. The four
of us then went to the Hotel Marechal
Niel, where an officer was waiting to ar
rest Jimenez, and notified him tnat the
young man had been released ou bonds.
"It waa then Father late. Our dinner
hour had passed and we were hungry.
! The ex-Judge had an engagement, but
I Kuvanaugh, Jimenc-z unu I went and took
| a siranle dinner at the Maison Tortoni.
j After dinner Ktivanaugii went his way and
| I wpnt to attend a patient. Jirupnez went
off with Carlo* O uigrrea, son of .President
Gutierrez, and I lost sight of him.
"Jimenez says he was District Attorney
in qne ot the courts of Salvador, and
claims to have Uen impressed into the
army, whore he was flogged by order*of
General Ezeta. 1 never knew Jimenez
before Tue.iday, but he seems a reliable,
truthful ymintr man."
At the Marechal Niel the ex-President
is cock of the walk. Jimenez is preparing
to depart, having been delicately requeued
to seek other quarters. Meanwhile Don
Carlos and lie never see each other, the
young man fiving his Excellency a wide
berth. Arrangements are being made for
the reception of the ex-President's wife,
who is about to join her husband and so
journ with him lor a time irj this City.
"What a funny piece of business this
whole thing is!'* exclaimed the general
last nijrht. "Jimenez claims that 1 or
dered him to be flogged, does he? WÂ»iy,
I don't even know tne poor boy by sight
or by name, nor do I know anything of
his family connections. What is possible
is that Jimenez may have been drafted
into the army and kicked against disci
pline, as young feilows pitfn do. If he did
kick he was made to toe the mark, 1 sup
pose. Surely the chief magistrate of a
nation is not the man to amuse himself
flosreing privates.
"I con.ass 1 ana bared." said the gallant
general, with a sign. "One of the evening
papers published a fantastic tissue of in
ventions by way of a resume of Salva
doran politics, and now a lot of reporters
have kept me on the rack for hours sim
ply that I may say the article is tfa* wild,
es; rubbish that was ever written. When
I speak I like to do so freely ; it is horrible
to battle with interpreters â simply hor
rible. If people want to ask questions
about the politics of Salvador why in
heaven's name don't they go to the
Consul?"

CUT ALL ROUND,
Traffic Manager Moss Has
a New Schedule Ready
to Spring.
WAITING FOR ENGINES
The Entire Tariff of Freights on
the Valley Road to Go
in Shortly.
BIG REDUCTIONS TO BE MADE
Shippers Will Be Taxed Twenty to
Twenty-Five Per Cent Less
Than at Present.
Within two weeks the Valley road will
be in the field as an all-round competitor
with the Southern Pacific for the trans
portation business of the lower portion of
the great San Joaquin Valley.
Two of its seven giant locomotives,
which were ordered a few months ago, are
expected to arrive at Stockton any day
and as soon as they are ready for service
the new road will issue a tariff-sheet to
cover shipments of all kinds in carload
lots between Stockton and La Urande, two
stations south of Merced.
This tariff is already prepared, but will
oot be made public until the road is
thrown open for general business.
Tbe first intimation of this contem
plated move on the part of Traffic Man
ager John Moss came in a communication
he sent to tne Railroad Commission yes
terday. It read as follows:
I have named a rate to-day of $1 85 per ton
of 2000 pounds for carriage of lime from Stock
ton to Merced in carload lots of twelve tons
and upward.
This is in advance of our regular tariff -sheet
which I hope to issue ere long.
On the strength of the significant closing
sentence of this brief epistle an interview
was sought with Mr. Moss. He made the
following statement:
"Two of our locomotives are on the way
here and we expect to have them ready
for work by the end of this month, when
we sball endeavor to relieve the producers
and shippers of the valley as far as we are
now operating â that is, between Stockton
and a little south of Merced â by handling
general freight in carload lots.
"We have no warehouses at present,
and therefore are not in a position to
handle miscellaneous merchandise until
our 'warehouses and sheds are complete.
.But we shall be prepared to handle car
load lots of any kind of goods. Our
rolling-stock comprises 250 flatcars and
50 boxcars."
Owine to the recent fire in Merced there
is a considerable amount of rebuilding to
be done, and among other things lime is
largely in demand in that city. Many in
quiries for a rate on this article were re
reived by Traffic Manager Mess, and
finally acceding to the demands of the
situation he yesterday quoted the rate
mentioned in the communication ad
dressed to the Railroad Commission.
This rate of $1 86 is a reduction of $1 25,
or 40 per cent, from that at present
charged by the Southern Pacific Company.
Mr. Moss, with nis customary courtesy,
informed General Freight Agent Sraurr
yesterday the new rate the Valley Road
had made effective, and there is every
probability that the Huntington line will
promptly meet the cut.
While the Valley Road tariff as a whole
it not to be made public till it becomes
operative, it is known it will make reduc
tions on all classes of freight that will be
equivalent to an average cut of between 20
and 25 per cent The heaviest pruning
will be done on the lower grade freight.
The cut on this in some cases will be as
much as 40 or 50 per cent. On some arti
cles, whose value is very small, the freight
charges are now so out of proportion to
their cost that they have virtually pro
hibited any movement in them. Under
the Valley road schedule this policy of
strangling industry by trying to exact
more than tbe traffic will bear will be
rendered nugatory, and all the industries
of tbe San Joaquin Valley will receive a
new stimulus.
Traffic Manager Moss has already dis
covered that his path is to be more thorny
than rosy. He had a visit yesterday from
W. B. Harrison of the Farmers' Union
Warehouse of Stockton, and Mr. Gillis of
the Union Transportation Company of
the same city. The object of tneir visit
was to try and induce the Valley road to
increase the differential between Stockton
and San Francisco on grain. They claim
that the present rate of 50 cents between
the two cities tended to injure the ware
house business of Stockton to the benefit
of San Fiancisco. They also represented
that where wheat is warehoused in Stock
ton before being shipped to San Francisco
or Port Costa the transportation com
panies should stand the expense of the
double handling, which is 10 cents per ton.
To comply with this demand would virtu
ally mean to cut the rate 10 cents on the
regular through rate from interior points
to Port Costa or San Francisco.
Neither of these suggestions is likely to
be adopted, as, un<!er the circum
stances, to do so Tould be out of harmony
with all business principles.
This matter has attracted considerable
attention at Stockton. It is said that the
trouble is really caused by the rivalry ex
isting between tbe California Navigation
and Improvement Company and the
Union Transportation Company. The
former succeeded in 'making a train"c.ar
rangement with the Valley road, thus se
curing a large increase in the volume of
its business. Gillis, who represents the
Union Transportlon Company at Stockton,
is also interested in the Farmers' Union
warehouse, and thereiore, it is said, has a
double motive in advancing the idea that
Stockton is being treated fairly.
In a recent interview published in the
Stoctton Record, H. J. Corcoran, manager
of the California Navigation and Improve
ment Company, explained the situation as
follows:
"The rates put out by the Valley road
on grain to Port Costa and Ban Francisco
will make no change at all in the grain
trade of Stockton, except to bring grain
through here which formerly went all rail
to Port Costa.
"Mi. Moss of the Valley road is a
thorough transportation man, and realizes
that to get business for his road he must
meet competition rates. This he has done,
ana no more. No one not a fool would
expect the Valley road to name a higher
differential than 50 cents, becausa it would
cause it to lose all its business to San
Francisco.
"Some of the local warehousemen are
responsible for this small difference in the
cost of shipping, because when our com
pany increased the rate to 75 cents per
ton, to protect them as well as ourselves,
they threw all their patronage to our com
petitors at the old rate of 50 cents and
forced us to restore that rate on our tariff.
They should bear with Christian fortitude
the consequences of their own foolish and
greedy policy."
A SUSPECTED BURGLAR
Albert Paul Is Confined in the Tanks
at the City Prison Feuding au
Investigation.
Albert Paul is confined in the tanks at
the City Prison pending an investigation.
He and another for whom the detectives
are searching are suspected of being the
burglars who have recently been operating
so extensively in Oakland.
Detectives Gibson and Wren, after dili
gent inquiry, found that they bad been
disposing oftheir plunder to a "fence" on
Mission street. They instructed the
"fence" to notify a policeman the next
time they called.
On Tuesday morning they called with
several hundred dollars' worth of broken
jewelry. "The "fence" made some sort of
an excuse and went outside. He saw
Policeman Sullivan and told him that two
men wanted by Gibson and Wren were in
his place. Sullivan demurred, as he
thought be might get into trouble, and
while he was in that condition of mind
Paul and his companion got suspicious
and left the place, taking different direc
tions. Sullivan went after Paul and ar
rested him. The other man is still at
liberty.

festival to be given next October in aid of
the Youths' Directory, met last evening
at the directory on Howard street, near
Seventeenth, to make arrangements for
the entertainment. Rev. Father Crowley,
who is at the head of the directory, is one
of the most active workers for the festival,
which promises to be one of the most
elaborate and successful affairs ol its kind
ever held in this City in spite of the
numerous other carnivals that are to be
held about the same time.
President James R. Kelly of the
Hiberma Bank acted as chairman of the
meeting last nig tit. The first action of tne
president was to appoint a committee to
see the wholesale dry-goods dealers of the
City and to obtain donations from them
for the festival. The following gentlemen
were appointed : David J. Costello, C. C.
Curtin and James Coujzhlan.
Fatlier Crowley stated that the eentle
men composing the various collecting com
mittees had not yet been notified, as he
wished the ladies to have a chance first.
He also announced that Armory Hall,
1327 Market street, had been secured for
the festival.
Father Crowley announced that during
the week he had bean visited by Mn-.e.
Louise Sorbier of the Woman's Educa
tional Union, who declared that the
Youths' Directory fair would seriously
hurt the Carnival of Nations which the
Woman's Union is going to gi"e a month
later. While the promoters of the di
rectory festival reeretted very much that
there should be any trouble between the
two organizations, he could not very well
do anything in the matter, as the many
arrangements had already been made for
the festival.
Resolutions expressing regret and a de
sire to harmonize with the Woman's
Union were ordered to be sent to Mine.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 17, 1896.
TWENTY-NINTH
FOR McKINLEY.
A Club Organization That
Means to Make Its
Presence Felt.
YOUNG MEN.
ENLISTING
From the Potrero to the
Democratic Tenth
Ward.
ALL ARE OUT FOR PROGRESS.
Trades and Tradesmen Will All
Bloom and Boom After
November.
The Twenty-ninth Assembly District,
situated in the heart of trie Tenth Ward,
bounded by Market, Third, Bryant and
Fifth streets, was until recently as closely
locked in the arms of the Democratic
party as anj section in Alabama or South
Carolina could possibly be.
It was so Democratic that in years gone
by the organizing of a Republican club in
this section was considered an act almost
of effrontery. In fact, so scarce were the
Republicans in that section of Ban Fran
cisco that when the oiticers intrusted
with conducting the election sought com
petent men belonging to the Republican
party to fill the positions of inspectors,
judges and clerks of precinct boards a suffi
cient number politically qualified for such
service could not be found. But, like all
other things, a change has come over the
inhabitants of that region on the south
side of Market street.
The late W. T. Higgius, who was an
assiduous politician in his day, saw the
necessity of breaking down the Demo
cratic barriers by organizing the young
men of tt:at section into a political body".
With this object in view, the storm bf
Democratic opposition was braced and the
Howard Republican Club was the result.
This was the entering wedge, and with the
planting of the Howard Club within the
confines of the enemy's walls converts to
the party of progress and protection
rprangupon all sides. To-day there is
not only a Howard Club in tne Twenty
ninth Assembly District but a Republican
McKinley Club, with a first-class organ
ization and officered by bright, intelligent
and patriotic young men.
That this Republican club is merely
ornamental and of no practical use to the
party to which it is loyally attached iÂ«Â» far
from the truth, as can be seen by the votes
cast for the respective nominees upon the
Assembly ticket two years ago.
John D. Coughlin, the Democratic nomi
l.ee, pollea 1305, his opponent, John J.
Dauehney, the Republican nominee,
polled 882, with George Elliott, a Repub
lican, who received the Populist nomina
tion, getting 667. From these figures it
will be seen that tho Republican can
didate came within 423 votes of winning
the prize. And it is conceded by welP
informed politicians that had Elliott be.n
out of the fight, Daughney would have
been elected. However this may be, it
cuts no figure now; the McKinley Club is
there to stay for the campaign, and its
members intend to make their presence
felt before the tl.ird day of next No
vember.
To Frank McManus is due a great deal
of the success of the Republican reform
movement in the district. Ho has live*
in the Potrero for years, and was the one
who two years aao formed the Republican
club upon which the present McKinley
Club is now reorganized.
In giving his reasons for his loyalty to
the Republican r irty, McManus in one of
his talkative rr oods a few days ago ex
pressed himself as follows:
"I am a Republican. lam for McKin
ley and I am for John D. Spreckels, and I
don't care who knows it either.
"I am for the Republican party because
it is the party of progress and protection.
It is the party and the only party that has
elevated the workingman out of the groove
in which the Southern cotton-planter kept
the negro. This party has kept up the
dignity of labor, kept up the pay of the
men and regulated the working hours to
eight hours a day. It is for home produc
tion, home protection and for keeping the
taxes down.
"I am for McKinley because he is the
father of protection, as Washington was
the father of liberty, and with McKinley
as President this country will bloom and
boom with industries. Manufactories will
open up all over the face of this broad
land, and in place of 1000 men being em
ployed in the Union Iron Worts there will
be 4000, and so it will be in the Rolling
mills and in every branch of business
throughout the whole land.
*'I am for John D. Spreckels because he
is a clean, pure man, raised right here in
San Francisco, knows the wants of the
people, and is in politics for the purpose of
making politics clean and decent.
"He wants nothing out of politics. He
has all he wants, but he loves this City
and be loves the Republican party, ana it
is for the purpose of making that party an
honor to the country and one fit to belong
to that makes him spend his time and his
money.
"In years gone by no decent man could
afford to be known as a politician. It was
next to being a horsethief. But with such
men as John D. Spreckels at the head of
it no man need be ashamed to say that he
is a Republican. Spreckels has no defense
to make against his character. It cannot
be attacked. He is above reproach, and
with ?-urli a man at the head of the party
in this City, if the respectable people want
clean, good government they can get it."
The following are the officers of the new
I club, all of whom were elected for the en
suing year: President, M. Shaughnessy;
first vice-presi'lent, John McNarrara; sec
ond vice-president, T. McManus; third
vice-president, William Savage; financial
j secretary, Georse W. Kearney ; recording
i secretary. J. E. Riordan; executive com
i mitteeâ William P. Doran (chairman), F.
A. Martin, James Galvin, Henry Me
-1 Laugh lin. Frank McManus, J. J. Feeney,
i T. Barry, W. H. Hughes; Bergeant-at-arms,
J. ShaugnnÂ«ssy.
The club has at present a membership of
231 members.
On motion of J. McNamara nineteen
vice-presidents were appointed by the
chairman as an enrolling committee to
represent the nineteen precincts in the
Twenty-ninth Assembly District.
To show that McManus is in full accord
with the members of his club It will only
I be necessary to say that when William P.
I Doran made a motion indorsing John D.
Sprockets, the National committeeman, as
the club's leader the audience went wild
with enthusiasm. Cheer after cheer for
I Spreckels and McKinley were given.
SUIT TO FORECLOSE.
The California Academy of Medicine
Gives a New Mortgage to
Pay an Old One.
The Secu-ity Savings Bank has brought
suit to foreclose a mortgage on the prop
erty of the San Francisco Mutual Benevo
lent Society and California Academy of
Medicine at Bush street and Van Ness
avenue.
On August 1, 18!K), the medical society
executed a promissory note for $12,000 in
favor of the bank, the note being secured
by the mortgage in question.
Tbe society has been unable to pay off
the mortgage yet and they wish more time
in wbicn to pay it. The present suit is
merely the legal method of continuing the
mortgage â the bank forecloses the old
mortgage and the society borrows money
from the bank to pay it, giving a new
mortgage for the amount necessary. This
course is necessary on the part of the
bank to prevent the old mortgage from
outlawing- _

NEW DEMOCRATIC
LOCAL MACHINE,
Buckley, Rainey, Daggett
and Lanigan Plan
ning One.
DUNDON'S OWN SCHEME.
The Ex-Supervisor Holds a
Frosty Harmony Meeting in
a Courtroom.
WATCHED BT THE BIG BOSSES.
Dundon Would Unite the Junta and
the Buckleyites by a District
Operation.
Ex-Supervisor P. F. Dundon is trying to
reorganize the local Democratic party and
he succeeded last evening in holding a
rather frosty meeting in Judge Conlan's
Police Court room for the purpose.
The party is about to be reorganized,
but greater masters of practical politics
than P. F. Dundon â Buckley, Rainev and
Lanigan â are going to boss this operation
and they will see that Mr. Dundon doesn't
run things too far off the track as he goes
about working his ambitious scheme.
Buckley and Rainey are taking an in
terest in Mr. Dundon's plan and might
possibly appropriate it later, but just now
they are only regulating it
Rainey, Daggett and Lanigan are about
ready to chuck the Junta into a common
pot with the Buckley organization and
then divide the new organization with
Buckley, in which operation Chris will
become boss of the works.
Dundon is trying to get the district
committees of the two organizations to
unite and select a new machine. The
Buckley plan, which is mainly being en
gineered by John McCarthy, president of
tne Occidental Club, is to have both sides
aeree on a committee of seven, which
shall control a primary election, at which
a new county committee and delegates to
a municipal convention shall be chosen.
McCarthy is proposing Senator "White,
Congressman Maguire, J. F. Sullivan.
Henry Eichoff and Sam Daniels as mem
bers of this committee.
Dundon has been interviewing members
of both factions for two or three weeks,
and among those invited to be pres
ent at the meeting last night were:
George T. Marye, Chris Reis, J. T. Burke,
J. Vi. McDonald, P. J. Harney, Dr. C. A.
Clinton, James Butler, John J. MrDade,
Richard I. Whelan, James M. Block,
William M. Hinton, Josepn Leggeti,
P. F. Dundon, Jeremiah Lynch, G.
vV. McEnerney, James M." Smith,
Judge J. J. Coffey, H. J. McAvoy, James
D. Phelan, Joseph Clark. F. F. Strother,
H. C. Creswell, John McCarthy, Judge O.
T. Conlan, A. M. Armstrong, James t.
Twigg and John E. Buckley.
Those who responded were Fire Commis
sioner McDonald, ex-Supervisor Strother,
Armstrong, McCarthy and Twige. While
this corporal's guard patiently waited for
an hour the arrival of some of thÂ« other
invited harmonizers, quite a number of
uninvited Democrats dropped in. Among
these were Superintendent George McGinn
of the House of Correction, Deputy Sheriff
Clack, Walter Gallagher, T. S. Cronin,
Harry M. Kelly and Joe Hayes. John
McCarthy also came to keep an eye on
things.
It was about 9 o'clock when Mr. Mc-
Donald became chairman of tne meeting
which he called to order. Mr. Twigg was
selected as secretary.
Dundon took the floor and after explain
ing the purpose of the meeting to be to
devise plans to reconcile the differences
existing between the two Democratic
factions submitted the following as the
basis of wooing peace back into the house
of Democracy:
We do hereby recommend that for thÂ» pur
pose of unitiug the whole Democratic party in
this City and County, the members of the
general committee 01 both factions shall till
any vacancies that are existing, and then at
an appointed anil agreed dale b;>th committees
shall come together in their severil districts

and elected both the present general commit
tees shall disband and allow the new commit
tee to conduct tne campaign and the affairs of j
the party, and formulate such plans as they
may consider for the best interests of the
organization.
After a short discussion the motion by
John McCarthy that the matter be post
poned until next Tuesday night was car
ried. It is not likely that Dundon's par
ticular scheme will get much further.
HANDBALL AND BOXING.
Olympic Players Meet at the Occiden
tal Court â Slavin and Joe
JlcAuliffe.
The annual championship handball
tournament of the Olympic Club was com
menced last evening at the Occidental
court on Grove street. It was almost 9
p. m. when referee E. N. Short called the
first set of players "into court."
Heuer and Bush met Slavin and Cobb in
the best two out of three games. The
latter team, which represented the third
class, easily disposed of their opponents.
The first ?ame resulted in a close finish,
Slavin and Cobb winning, the score stand
ing 21 to 18 in their favor. Tbe second
game resulted also in their favorâ score
21 to 12.
In the second class Morton and Coffin
met James and Bradley. The former won
the first score 21 to 17. The second and
third games were won by Bradley and
James. Scores: 21â11,21â12.
The finish of the first-class teams will be
decided this evening.
Quite a lar_e gathering of ladies and
gentlemen witnessed the contests.
Young Mitchell, the director-eeneral of
the Occidental Athletic Club, consum
mated a match yesterday between Joe Mc-
Auliffe (Barney Farley's boy) and Frank
P. Slavin, late of New "York! but recently
of London, England. McAuliffe weighs
290 pounds at present, but his old trainer,
Farley, contends that he will run his boy
down to 230 pounds by the time he meets
Slavin.
Mitchell says that the contest will take
place under the auspices of his club in
September.
The sports who know McAuliffe and are
conversant with his ways of training say
that Farley cannot possibly hold McAui
iffe in check, but as thiswili be his last
chance, the "Mission Giant" may get
down to hard work and train as other
flehters who mean business do.
Frank P. Slavin will arrive in this City j
on Saturday evening. There will be spir
ited biddine amonc the clubs for the con
teat between Slavin and Choynski.

BIG CHANGE IN RATES.
Rush to Avoid the F.ires Restored by
the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company.
Advices received at the local offices of
the Southern Pacific yesterday state that
the special train out from Portland last
night consisted of tif tten tourists and five
standard coaches, containing about 400
people on their way to this City.
For the train that leaves this City co
night for the north there have already
beeu about 300 applications for tickets,
and by the time the train leaves it is ex
pected that the number will reach neariy
400.
This great rush is due to the fact that
these are the last trains that will be
operated under the cut rates which have
prevailed for the last ten months
Tde Pacific Coast Steamship Company
has issued its formal notice restoring the
passenger rates to British Columbia and
Pugei Sound points. There become effec
tive on the steamship Umaiilla, wliich
leaves Tacoma July 20, and on the steam
ship Walla Walla, which leaves this City
July 23.

Victoria, Port Townsend, Seattle and
Tacoma. The same rates apply south
bound.

If the Populist kid ever gets on the in
side cf the Democratic tiger we shall see
no more of the kid.
"To be or not to be," says the Populist.
"Shall we live as the coming party or die
with the Democrats?"
When the Southern Populist gets into
the same boat with the Southern Demo
crat there will be a lively row.
It is within the ranee of possibilities
that Bryan may.go to St. Louis to repeat
his oratorical triumph and bust.
McKinley talks always of business and
prosperity, while Bryan talks only of civil
disturbances and class legislation.
The Democratic shouters are all for the
boy orator, but the thinking men of the
party are turning their backs on him.
The old . rock-ribbed Democracy has
been shattered by the dynamite conven
tion and the landslide is something won
derful. \'j' % .' i "^.}"Vf^

It begins to look as if the Democrats
put wool on the free list simply to get it
more cheap to pull over the eyes of the
Populists.
The Republicans of the State have begun
the campaign wisely by organizing clubs.

accomplished. . .., .

Debs will not be a candidate for the

form and Bryan ticket are sufficiently rev
olutionary for him. ..

That Gorman will support the Bryan
ticket is not unexpected. He is prepared
to support most anything that will help
him to be re-elected to the Senate by the
next Maryland Legislature.
Democracy in this campaign endeavors
to excite one class of people against an
other, but the Republican party harmon
izes the interest of alt on a broad platform
of measures designed for the benefit of all.
In â  deciding to go ahead with the ferry
depot building and to make use of Cali

have done * the : proper thing, ana it can
hardly, be doubted that the : courts will
sustain them. '
The number, of conservative business
men who are leaving the Democratic party
at this juncture is encouraging ;in much
more than a partisan sense. It is an evi
dence that the great body of intelligent
people of the country are . thoroughly ; pa
triotic, ; and i that â  they will never: allow
party spirit to lead Â». them to sacrifice the
welfare of the Republic
POPULISTS GET INDEPENDENT.
A new phase to the question of nominat
ing Bryan by tbe Populist convention has
developed, which is likely to do a good j
deal of damage to the Nebraska man's
hopes. It has been discovered that the j
nomination of Bryan would oblige Popu- :
list candidates for Congress and local i
offices all over the United States to resign, i
because in nominating the Democratic i
candidate the National Poputist party j
would be absorbed and its name be erased !
from the list of parties. All Populists j
would then have to support as nominees for i
Congress and for local offices such Demo- j
crats as were in harmony with the Chi
cago platform. To be sure Populists
might continue their State organizations,
but they would have to take orders from
tbe Democratic Central Committee, so !
that there might be no conflict. Of course j
it would not do at all to have Democrats
and Populists running for the same office,
and as the Democracy would "boss
things," the only satisfaction aspiring !
Populists would have would be what they (
could get out of voting the Democratic
ticket straight.
That such a condition of things would j
obtain was not suspected until Taube- j
neck gave a hint of it a day or two ago, I
and now there is a commotion all along j
the line, which is almost sure to culmi- j
nate in a split in the party if Bryan is in- i
dorsed and the Chicago platform accepted j
in lieu of a straight-out declaration of
Populist principle?. Another thing, I
though only in the shape of a rumor, is j
making some trouble. It is hinted that j
certain prominent Populists have been \
promised cabinet positions and diplo- j
matic appointments abroad in considera
tion of throwing the Populist convention
into the maw of the new Democracy.
But, perhaps, the strongest influence j
that will be brought to bear to hold the j
convention and nominate a straight ticket ;
is an array of figures which go to prove j
that with the gold wing of the Democracy i
withdrawn the Populist is the stronger
party in the Slates where there are any
hopes of either party carrying, which
really makes the Popu'ists second and
the Democrats third in the light of possi
bilities to carry the country, or at least to
throw the election of President into Con
gress. It is argued from this that the
Populists and Republicans rre now, and â 
will continue to be, the two great political J
parties of the country, and that any affili
ation with the Democracy, except upon its |
absorption by tbe Populist party, would be
to commit party hara-kiri right on the
eve of victory. It is also figured out by
some of the Populists that if the election
goes to Congress tneir party will have
more electoral votes than tbe Democrats, '
winch would put them in tbe position of I
obliging Bryan to accept the Vice-Presi
dency as the price of a combination of
Populist and Democratic electoral votes.
It is a beautiful muddle, and all who want
to see patriotism, protection and prosper
ity prevail are enjoying it
WILLIAM E.RUSSELL
The sudden deatn of William Eustis
Russell at this juncture is in the nature of
a public calamity. His youth, bis char
acter, his political leadership and his
patriotism made his personality one of
more than ordinary importance to the
country. He was in a particular sense
needed at this time, when the old con
servative party to which be belonged is so
rapidly shifting its ground to extreme
radicalism and when the influence in its
councils of young conservatives of brains
and energy is essential to prevent it from
becoming a dangerous menace to the wel
fare of the Republic.
Rejected by the wild convention at Chi
cago, Mr. Russell was nevertheless one of
the truest leaders of bis party and was re
garded by many of the conservative busi
ness men among Democrats as the man
best fitted to become its candidate for tbe
Presidency Young in years, he had al
ready achieved a higti distinction in poli
tics. He began his official career when
24 years of age aa a member of the Com
mon Council of his native city of Cam
bridge, and after serving two terms in that
capacity was elected Mayor. In 18S8 he was
nominated for Governor and made a cam
paign which, although ending in defeat,
won him the rank of the foremost young
Democrat in New England. In the next
campaign he was again defeated, but by a
reduced majority. In 1890 his triumph
came, and hs was elected Governor and
re-elected in 1891. In the succeeding year
he declined a renomination and since then
has been the Presidential favorite of New
England Democracy.
His early success was due largely to his
rare gifts as an orator. Before the hostile
audience at Chicago he could do no more
than maintain his cause with dignity.
There was no chance for him to rouse en- j
thusiasm there, for the prosperity of
eloquence lies as much in the ear that
hears as in the tongue that utters it He
was thus unfairly pitted against the boy
orator of the Platte, who had only to
appeal to a sentiment already formed in
order to accomplish a triumph.
Russell at Chicago was also very largely
under tbe shadow of tbe New York lead
ers, Whitney and HilL He waatooyonng !
and too little known to National politics |
to assert himseif against the older and !
more famous leaders. It cannot be donbted, j
however, that in the four years to come he 1
would have risen rapidly in fame and po- |
litical prestige. Democracy now going to j
disaster under Bryan will look longingly !
to its conservative leaders after next No- j
vember, and had Russell's life been spared
be would surely have been of great service !
to both hia party and his country in quid- j
ing bewildered Democracy back to the !
firm ground of conservatism and thÂ» con- j
stitution.
THE FERRY DEPOT.
The action of the Harbor Commissioners
in deciding to beein work at once on the
ferry depot building and to make use of
California stone will be generally com- j
mended. It is true that in taking this 1
action the commission runs the risk of
being confronted later on by an adverse
decision of the Supreme Court. The risk,
however, is not great. It is certainly not
sufficient to justify a long postponement
of the beginning of a work which has al
ready been delayed too long, and for the
completion of which the people are rightly
impatient
The prompt commencement of the work
is the more important because at this time
there is such a pressing need to provide
employment for as many men as possible
and to put money into circulation. We
called attention a few days aco to the fact
that there has been appropriated for pub
lic work m this City $2,000,000 by the Na
tional Government, $300,000 by the City
for a new municipal building, ana by the
State $000,000 for the ferry depot," and
$250,000 for the buildings of the Affiliated
Colleges. This money should not be left
in idleness if there is any possible way to
put it into circulation by an immediate
beginning ot the proposed work, and the
Harbor Commissioners have done exactly
what is right in deciding to go ahead.
It is not easy to see how any harm can
result from the action taken. The begln
uiug of the work will hare a tendency to
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 17, 1896.
make the Supreme Court act promptly on
the case if an appeal is taken to that body.
Therefore, even if a decision is given
against the commission in the use of Cali
fornia stone, something will have been
gained at any rate in getting the question
settled without a prolonged wait. The
commission we may be sure will have the
strong support of public sentiment in
favor of its resolve, and there would be no
little satisfaction in seeing work on the
Affiliated Colleges and the municipal
building begun with an eqnal promptness.
CALIFORNIA AND PROTECTION.
California has the essentials of indus
trial greatnessâ of industrial independ
ence we might say. Wheat, wool and
dairy products probably will continue to
lead all other industries in importance,
but fruit, tobacco and the many other
staples are needed to round out the State's
industrial possibilities, and tbey should
be fostered quite as much as those articles
of commerce which lead in volume and
value. California is so situated geographi
cally and the topography of the country is
of such a character that it conld become
an empire within its own borders. But
the geographical relation of the State to
other countries is so advantageous that
our commercial empire should reach for
and wide in all directions. We could
manufacture many of the leading articles
of interstate and international trade, and
at the same time be a large purchaser of
such commodities of other countries as do
not justify production here, but some
thingâa good dealâ has to be done before
the crust of the State's possibilities is
much more than broken.
In the first place California cannot hope j
to have that degree of industrial develop
ment which nature designed she shou.d !
have until capital is assured by proper |
and lasting tariff legislation that it will
not be subjected to spasmodic changes in
import duties, with a continual threat of
free trade. When that is secured, when I
capital can feel safe to calculate upon per
manent investment, whatever is in suffi
cient quantity or can be increased to a
sufficiency to justify the erection of in
dustrial plants to turn out finished prod
ucts will be taken up, and money
will be found to be ready to com
mence the work and carry it forward.
There are rare opportunities in California,
or would be under adequate protection, to
establish woolen factories equal to the
best of any country; out sheep are neces
sary to a woolen-mill, and unless sheep
raising is protected aeainst hurtful for
eign competition capital will not ventnre
in the business. The fruit industry of
California inherits from nature, we might
say, possibilities that are almost limit
less. There would be no end to the va
riety of the products of our fruit nor a
reason why they ibould not be found in
every market in the world if the needed
National legislation could be bad.
The tobacco of California is superior in
quality and the aoil is such that a satis
factory yield coula be counted upon every
year, but to give that industry the magni
tude it should have there needs to be a
guard standing at our coast towns to see
that foreign tobacco-growers do not fill
our markets with their pauper labor prod
act. But it is not worth the while to
particularize. Ever)' commercial interest
of California will continue in a dwarfea
condition, nor need healthy growth be ex
pected until there are assurances that
when capital undertakes to develop the
vast resources of the State and transform
raw material into tinisned product it will
be protected from onslaught by competi
tors who go upon the principle that a
wageman is simply a cog in a wheel,
possessing no rights in a political or social
way that bis employer need respect.
When protection becomes a fixed principle
of the Government, and to tinker with it
would be considered an attack upon the
rights of the people, will California be
transformed into a mighty industrial
country.
A CAMPAIGN OF PERFIDY.
TbÂ« San Francisco Examiner't New York
annex, the Journal, is making & desperate
effort to swallow the Democratic pill pre
pared by Altgeld's convention, but "our
fears do make us traitors" it might say.
The Journal likes Bryan as the animal
trainer likes a tiger that is fresh from the
jungle, and, like the trainer, it wishes its
animal possessed more docility of char
acter. The Journal has hoped, however,
that Bryan will develop into something
better than the Chicago platform provides
for, and that when he comes to realize
how "shallow draughts intoxicate the
brain" he will drink largely from the
spring of common- sense, and finally be
come a sober, reasonable and safe man for
White House purposes. Still the sus
picion of the trainer abides with the
Journal. It dots not propose to trust the
animal too far. It proposes to have a
lasso ready to pull him off if be should
think himself again in the jungle and
whatsoever came in sight his legitimate
meat.
In introducing the question of Bryan's
candidacy, a candidacy which it will
support, the New York Journal, says
the Chicago platform "involves con
fusion, distress, and, as regarding existing
contracts, partial repudiation." Never
theless, it will help bring confusion, dis
tress and repudiation upon the country.
Confusion, distress and repudiation of
ail that is honest and just and
true are the fundamental principles
of the government of sheol. 80,
then, it is "better to reign in hell than
serve in heaven," politically speaking. Ig
that the idea the Journal wishes to con
vey? If not, why does the Journal advo
cate the election of a candidate for Presi
dent of the United States whom it an
nounces editorially to be the champion of
"confnsion, distress, and, as regarding ex
isting contracts, partial repudiation?"
But the Journal does not mean that
there shall be confusion, distress and re
pudiation as the outcome of Bryan's elec
tion, and to avoid such a calamity it pro
poses to conduct the Democratic side of
the National campaien on lines of perfidy,
falsehood and hypocrisy and tans fool
Bryan and those who may honestly sup
port him on principle. The Journal's
scheme involves several contingencies, and
cunningly, though most deceitfully, pro
vides for them all, including Bryan's
treachery to the friends who compassed
his nomination and to the declaration of
principles which he is pledged to pot into
practical operation.
To bring about a hapnv culmina
tion of its plana, the Journal nrges
upon Democrats everywhere to "vote
for sound money Congressmen and the
National ticket." That is u> say, vot6
for Bryan for President and anti-Bryan
candidates for Congress. The idea is, of
course, to tie Bryan's bands with a hostile
Congress. "The election of a free silver
President," says the Journal, "would not
necessarily mean the free coinage of sil
ver," for "all such a President conld do
would be to sign a bill passed by both
houses of Congress." Certainly if the
Journal can manage to elect a Democratic
Congress that would refuse to past any
bill that Bryan might want passed be
would be very securely bottled up, and
so would his platform with its various sec
tional declarations. The Journal has a
great head for diplomatic as well aa sev
eral other kinds of cunning* So has tbe
ostrich, and, too, it shows most when it
tries most to hide.
But the Journal has still a "last resort,"
which it thinks may furnish pegs to hang
hopes upon. Should the scheme to elect
a hostile Congress fail, then there is the
hope that Mr. Bryan, "sobered by the re
sponsibilities of power, may fail to live up
to the fanatical D latform of an excited
convention." If Bryan is to be "sobered
by the responsibilities, of power" after ne
is elected, be must be drunk now on the
fumes of a "fanatical platform," but will
he ever "sober up"? He baa made a
doÂ»en speeches since nis nomination, and
in every one of them he applauded the
Chicago platform as the product of pretty
nearly superhnman wisdom. The Journal
is not complimentary to Mr. Bryan. It
pins its faith, next to having a hostile
Congress, to the candidate's make-up on
lines of treachery and ingratitude, which
will blossom into an out-and-out repudia
tion of the "fanatical" Chicago platform
and into the advocacy of tbe Journal's
kind of "sound money," wbicn Is the
gold standard. This ia the hardest thing
that has ever been said about Bryan, and
never before was such a campaign of per
fidy, hypocrisy and falsehood advocated
by newspaper or politician.
TROUBLE IS MAIKE.
Mr. Arthur Sewall'B ambition to adorn
the tail end of the Democratic ticket ia
likely to cost the party in his own State its
life. Nominations lor local and Congres
sional offices were already made when the
Chicago convention was held, and without
a single exception the several nominating
convention* indorsed the administration
of Grover Cleveland ; deplored the vicious
and wicked fallacies of the Bryans, Blands
and Altgelds; renewed their allegiance to
the Democratic doctrine of sound money
and a tariff for revenue only, and in adÂ«
vance repudiated the very "heresies"
which were subsequently adopted at Chi
cago as clean-cut Democratic principles.
Now the question is, Will the Democ
racy of Maine repudiate Sewall or its own
platform and iw candidates for local office?
There was not, of course, the slightest sus
picion that Sewall would be nominated
for Vice-President when the Maine con
ventions were held, and so the State
Democracy was pledged in advance to bolt
the very declarations that Sewall will ask
to have made tbe issue. It is clear that
tbe situation is very much complicated,
but a man who is brave enough to run for
a local office in Maine on a Democratic
platform is brave enough to hack Bryan
and Sewall to pieces, and very small- pieces
at that. Tbe chances are the State party
will go right ahead and try to capture a
few offices on its own platform and let
Mr. Sewal! paddle his own canoe. How
ever, Sewall is president of a National
bank and is a very wealthy man, which
will enable him to exert considerable influ
ence, but of course on a cash basis.
LADY'S NIGHT ROBE.
Night robes made in the old-fashioned sack
shape, with large sleeves and a big collar, are
very pretty, and have the advantage of requir
ing less material than other shapes. The back
may be made with a bias seam, which avoids
piercing at the bottom, and cuts to better ad
vantage. The ease with which these gowns
may be laundered recommends them to many.
Lounging or bath robes are cut after the
same model, being liked, as they are less
bulky than those with pleats or gathers at the
top.
Batiste is the material used when any nice
gowns are made. A Editor-collar is made of
fine Hamburg edging, which is seamed from
all the corners to the neck, to bring the scal
lops around the edge.
White lawn is also used and with a collar of
the same trimmed on the edge with an in
sertion of Valenciennes lace and beyond this a
ruffle of tbe plain lawn or of embroidery is
very dainty, a collar with embroidery set on
with braiding, through which delicate- colored
ribbons are drawn, is also pretty.
These gowns may be made quite elaborate
by tucking the goods down the back ana front
and also tucking the sleeves.
Heavy nightgowns of flannelette or heavy
muslin cannot be better made than in this
style. The collar may be made of China silk
for flannelette gown to give a dainty touch, for
the silk wears quite as well as the flannelette.

AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
"The wool industry in California looks to
McKinley and protection to restore it to a
paying basis." said D. E. Knight yesterday
at the Lick.
Mr. Knight Is the agent for the Marysville
woolen mill and its branches in different
parts of California.
"The llarysville woolen mill," he contin
- ned, "is the oldest in the State. Itwasstarted
I in 1867, and Is one of the last to continue the
j busineas. In good timesâ that is before Cleve
| land went into officeâ we used to use from
i 800,000 to 1,000,000 pounds of wool a year.
1 Iki amount depended some on the quality of
! the goods. This year we will have used, per
haps, 500,000 poundsâ hardly that. Where
we employed 110 men before, we now have
only about 75 at work. We are waiting for a
protective tariff to restore fair prices and give
the men a chance to make a living.
"The country abont Marysvillehas furnished
all the wool used in the mill, but the sheep
have been very much reduced in the last few
years. Owners have been forced to sell their
I sheep in order to live, because there has been
j no money in wool.
"Where there used to be 2,000,000 pounds of
wool in a year, now there are only about 700,
-000 pounds, perhaps not that much. Think
of only seven cents a pound for spring wool
this year that osed to- bring from 15 to 24
cents! Why, at seven cents there is nothing
left after the sheep man pays for shearing,
sacking and marketing hi 6 wool.
"I saw asample the other day of woolen goods
Imported from Europe. It was fifty-six inches
wide, weighed twenty-two ounces to the yard,
and sold in New York for 58 cents. At that
rate we couldn't pay our employes over $2 a
week for their labor. We must get 90 cents to
$1 for the American manufacturer to make a
living. With McKinley in office that importa
tion of woolen goods made by cheap labor will
stop.
"We have supplied a good many white woolen
blankets to the Eastern market this year.
When they want a high-class article they hare
to patronize home industry."

The Salt Lake Tribune advises Republicans
to vote for Bryan, but not for Democratic Con

Wnat good will it do to pass a protective tariff
bill if Bryan is elected to veto it? Unless both

whom would pass it over nis veto the passage
would be useless.

Are as white as white can be ' â 
Bat never one in the harbor
As white as the Bails at sea. - . â 
And the clouds that crown the mountains
With purple and gold delight.
Tarn to cold gray mist and vapor
Kre ever we reach the height.
Th* mountains wear crowns of glory
Only when seen afar,
And the satis lose all their whiteness
Inside of the harbor bar.
Stately and fair Is the vessel â  <
That comes not near our beach;
Stately and grand the mountain,

O distance! Thou dear Enchanter,
Still bold In thy magic veil
The glory of far-off mountains,
The gleam of tne far-off sail.

VIEWS OF WESTERN EDITORS.
Convenient Silence.
Visalia Delta.
The Times was tickled to death because
seventeen delegates left the Republican Na
tional Convention, bnt it has nothing to say
when 160 Democratic delegates decline to par
ticipate in the nomination of a candidate for
the Presidency and when 230 take no part in
the nomination of a Vice-President.
Very Fanny.
Oakland Enquirer. '
It was an actual fact, young Mr. Bryan did
sit down, upon being told of his nomination,
and did write a proclamation which, he says,
he had long had in mind, "in case of such an
emergency," to the effect that under no cir
cumstances would he accept a ncmination for
a second term as President. It was the fun
niest incident of the whole Chicago business.
Olive Branches in Demand.
Fresno Republican.
If olive branches could be coined at a ratio
of 16 to 1 the Populist brethren could set
themselves up in business as the most ple
thoric plutocrats of the nineteenth century
within a period of trn days. The Democracy
has enough olive branches ready to dump upon
them to make the whole party look like a St.
Patrick's day parade from now until Novem
ber.
What It Mean*.
Stockton Independent.
The Democratic platform wants the income
tax in ad a legal in order that the low tariff may
be maintained. It also wants free and un
limited coinage of silver. Taken together
these planks mean that Democrats want to
continue to buy as largely as possible abroad,
but want to drive out of the country the only
form of money with which they can continue
to purchase foreign goods.

2041 tons burden, 335 feet long, 42 feet G
inches broad and 26 feet 7 inches deep.
She will take away about 3500 tons of
wheat.
The Linlithgow was not built for speed,
and in consequence she took over twenty
days to come here from Nagasaki. Her
officers' quarters are small, but then her
coal and freight capacity are first rate.
The other tramps on the way here are the
Strathgarry, Captain White, 3264 tons
register, 396 feet long, 48 feet 7 inches
broad and 28 feet deep, and the Un

feet 9 inches deep. All three vessels carry
water ballast.
Captains Burns and Whitelaw expect to
have the wrecked Biairmore alongside the
wharf this afternoon. Ail the ballast will
have been taken out by that time and the j
vessel will probably right herself. The ]
bodies of Mate Thomas Ludget, 35 years
old, a native of Ireland, and sailors Henry
Clark and Rowland E. Biegle have been
recovered and taken to the Morgue. The
British Consul will attend to their burial.
The British ship Craigmore is on the

and a full cargo. The same company's
steamer Queen will only make two more
trips to Alaska this season. She will leave
Tacoma on the 2lst inst, and again on '
August 8. The outings this year have !
been most delightful and the company I
has received bushels of letters expressing
the pleasure of the excursionists. Nearly
all the berths on the Queen have been tak
en for the next two trips, and those who
intend visiting the glaciers will have to
secure accommodation at once.
The Harbor Commissioners canceled
their contract for the repiling and planking
of Bryant street between Main and Spear
yesterday. The time in which the work
was to be done expired on the Ist inst. and
the firm has yet made no move. Attorney
Tirey L. Ford was instructed to inform
J. R. Garmss, the local manager of the
American Surety Company, that his* cor
poration would be held responsible for
any loss that may ensue. The Surety
Company was on Oallaway, Townley &
Co.'s bond.
The schooner Moonlight, that is going
on a search for a lost guano island, cleared
and sailed for Aitata yesterday, if the

from San Quentin during the past week,
and they have all congregated on the
water front They have secured a horse
and wagon, with which they patrol, ni^ht
and day, from Meiggs wharf to Third
street, and woe betide the unguarded ves
sel that happens to be in their way.
Numerous thefts bave been reported.
Yesterday they got away with a coil of
rope from the steamer Kahului in broad
daylight. The police are now on their
trail, and the chances are that some of
them, at least, will be captured in a few
days.
There is sure to be a rush of people next
Suncay to the wreck of the Pacific Mail
steamer Colombia. By steamer it is only
a three hours' run, and should the day be
fine it will be a most enjoyable outing.
Two steamers will go to tne seene â the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's Corona
from Broadway wharf and Kimbali &
Co.'s Newsboy from Mission-street wharf.
Both vessels will charge $2 for the round
trip, and will start at 9 A. m. The excur
sionists will have three hours at Pigeon
Point, and will be back in San Francisco
by 6p. v. Tickets by the Newsboy can be
secured from J. 8. Kimbttll & Co., 22 Mar
ket street, and by the Corona from tbe
Piper-Aaen-Goodali Company, 24 Clay
street.
Rev. James Fell and Captain Rae of the
British ship Springburn are at outs. The
reverend gentleman, who has charee of
the Mariners' Institute on Steuart street,
ventured to tell tbe skipper how to handle
his sailors. Captain Rae then politely
told the, Rev. Mr. Fell to mind his own busi
ness and get off his bhip. Able Seaman
Davis thought he should be in the Hospital,
and Dr. Chalmers and the captain think
there is no necessity for sending him
there. Dr. Fell sides with the sailor, hence
tbe trouble.

ROWING OVER A BUREAU,
Sacramento's Federated Trades
Indorses the Labor Com
missioner.
It Gives a Severe Slap at the San
Francisco Trades Council's
President.
Several weeks ago the San Francisco
Labor Council passed a resolution offered
by T. F. Burns, one of its officers, con
demning Labor Commissioner E. L. Fitz
gerald and the Free Labor Bureau.
Tne complaint was that there were two
entrances to the Dtireau, one for those
seeking employment, which is from Till
man place, while the employers enter the
front door at 325 Sutter street. This dis
tinction Mr. Burns thinks is undemocratic
and an infringement upon tbe equal rights
principle that all are supposed to enjoy.
The council indorsed his views of the
situation.
Not so with the laboring men of Sacra
mento, for the central labor body of that
city has taken the San Francisco central
labor body severely to task, as shown by
the annexed correspondence upon the sub
ject:
Federated Trades Cockcii. of Sacramento )
July 15, 1898.
Han. E. L. Fitzgeraldâ Deab Bib: The accom
panying resolutions were adopted by this
council June 29, and at our mejting July 13
1 was instructed to forward n copy to you. The
delay was owing to our desire to give the Han
Francisco Labor Council an opportunity to in
vestigate and reconsider its action, but as
it lias not seen fit to do so we now transmit a
copy to jou. Respectfully youri,
Frank Cooke, Secretary.
The resolutions are as follows*:
* Whereas. The San Francisco l,abor Council
has seen fit to psss resolutions condemna
tory of the State Labor Commissioner In his
conduct of the Free Employment Bureau at
325 Sutter street. San Francisco; and whereas
after due investigation aud report on the part
oÂ£ a committee irom the Federated Trades
Council of Sacramento, it appears that em
ployes and employers are treated with equal
courtesy nnd consideration; and whereas, the
i Labor Commissioner is doing a noble work in
the interest of all the people; therefore be it
Resolved, That the above condemnatory
resolutions are entirely uncalled tor end un
just.
Jiao vat, That It is the sense of this council
that its sister council in San Francisco should
thoroughly investigate the Free Employment
! Bureau and coolly deliberate on the methods
i pursued by the Labor Commissioner before
committing Itself to condemnatory resolu
tions.
Kwolved, That our sister council would be
doing itself and the laboring masses generally
a service by aiding and assisting the Labor
Commissioner instead of retarding the food
work he is accomplishing on behalf of hu
man iu-.
Xrtolrrd, That a copy of these resolutions be
forwarded to Governor James H. Budd Labor
Commissioner EL L. Fitzgerald and the Ban
FraucUco Labor Council.

An Unsuspecting Canvasser Relieved
of Three Cheap Dia
monds.
A. R. McFariane, a canvasser for a jew
elry installment house, was beautifully
"flim- Hammed" yesterday afternoon by
an unknown Italian. McFariane was ex
hibiting his wares on Bryant street, be
tween Seventh and Eighth, when, accord
ing to his story, the driver of a wagon
which was standing in front of a macaroni
factory asked what he had.
McFariane exhibited his samples and
the man called to a companion within the
factory to come out and Fee the diamonds.
The new-comer took a decided interest in
the brilliants and induced McFariane to
allow him to take thorn in the factory to
show to his uncle.
The unsuspecting canvasser complied,
but the prospective purchaser failed to re
turn. Inquiry in the factory developed
the fact tlint the man was unknown. The
teamster in tue meantime had driven
away.
McFariane notified the police, and the
teamster, who is in the employ of the
Yoriemfte Flour Mills, was arrested. He
claimed not to know the man who had
seized the jewelry, out nevertheless he
was taken to the Folsorn-street station
pending an investigation. McFariane
estimates his loss at $51.
WILL ERECT TRIBUNES.
The Carnival Committee Gets a
Concession From the Street
Committee.
F. A Haber Wins the Priz^ for the
Best Design for the Carnival
Emblem.
Two very important steps were taken by
the executive committee of the Carnival of
the Golden Gate yesterday. In the morn
ing General Backus and Colonel O'B/rne
appeared before the Street Committee of
the Board of Supervisors, asking that ex
clusive right be granted the executive
committee to erect grand stands and
tribunes on Market street and Van Ness
avenue during carnival week. Colonel
O'Byrne presented the matter to the com
mittee and stated that it was the desire
of the carnival management to charge a
small sum for the privilege of occupying
these seats that would be provided, and to
keap them out of the hands of speculators.
The funds thus derived will be used to
meet the expenses of the carnival. The
committee unanimously recommended
the granting of the petition.
Another step was the securing of the
Mechanics' Pavilion, commencing on
Monday, October 5. This will follow im
mediately upon the close of the Manufac
turers' Fair. It is expected to be able to
occupy the Pavilion for the first carnival
performance on Wednesday nignu The
management will endeavor to place their
decorators at work on the interior of the
Pavilion immediately after the close of
the fair, and will see exhibitors at the
Pavilion to request them to hasten the re
moval of their goods. The date of the car
nival, in accordance with tbese contracts,
is definitely set for Monday, October 5.
and will continue for the following six
days, closing on the following Saturday
night.
The following partial Hat of collectors
was announced last night: Harry Mann,
William Greer Harrison and W. J. Cal
lingham for the Insurance companies;

Charles Montgomery, restaurants and
hotels; Colonel John O'Bryne and Judge
Bahrs, new City Hall; J. M. Litchtield,

The design of "Folly rampant upon the
bear rampant," submitted by F. A. Haber,
was awarded the special prize oi $25 for
the best design for the carnival, aud has
already been forwarded to be copyrighted.
Mr. Haber declined to accept the prize,
and offered to donate it to the committee,
with the request that it be offered as a
premium for the best series of posters of
the new art style descriptive of the
carnival.
The prize of $25 offered for posters is
open now to the competition of local ar
tists. The posters intended for competi
tion must be in the hands of the executive
committee, at the headquarters in the
Mills' building, not later than July 27
at 4 f. m.
The change of date for the benefit at the
Columbia Theater will necessitate a
change of programme. Tickets hereto
fore sold for the benefit wiil be available
for the performance next Thursday even
ing, and can be exchanged at the box
office next Wednesday for reserved seats.
The auction sale wi!l take place next
Tuesday afternoon at 1 o'clock, anil a very
novel method of disposing of the seats
will bÂ« Introduced on this occasion.

DICK WILLIAMS
HAS DISAPPEARED,
Generally Believed That He
Has Sought Safety in
Mexico.
HIS BAIL IS DOUBLED.
Three United States Deputy Mar
shals Seek in Vain for the
Ex'lnspector.
MBS. WILLIAMS FILES A PAPER
Says Her Husband Hed Only Fifty
Dollars When He First Went Into
the Custom-Hcuse.
It is believed in customs circles that
Dick Williams, now under indictment by
the Federal Grand Jury for fraudulently
landing Chinese, has fled the country.
So firm is this conviction that United
States District Attorney Foote went into
court yesterday morning and asked that
toe ex-inspector's bonds be increased from
$2000 to $4000, or $500 each on the four in
dictments. In support of this request the
District Attorney presented an affidavit
from Mrs. Williams and a second from
Miss Maggie Gillespie, a former neighbor
of Williams. The ex-inspector's wife, in
her affidavit, says among cither things:
After tho said indictments were filed I
heard the defendant say a number of times
that he did not care for the bond tiled for his
appearance in court in said cause; that the
Raid bond would be not sufficient to induce
him to stay in the State of California if he
thought he was going to be convicted : that lie
could leave the State and go to China, and that
he had money enough to enable him to live
there all his life, to live without doing any
work; that if he went to China he Intended to
open a gambling-house and there pursue that
as an occupation.
Mrs. Williams then goes on to say that
when she ceased to live with her husband
he had $5300 in greenbacks and between
$700 and $800 gold coin in the house. In
addition to that there was $3000 in the
Sun Francisco Savings Union to her credit,
the same having been given to her at
various times by Williams in order that
suspicion might not be directed toward
him. The house in Scott street is owned
by Williams, but is in her father's name.
Mrs. Williams also says that when her
I husband was appointed inspector two
years ago he was compelled to borrow $50
| in order to mafce a respectable appear
! ance.
Miss Gillespie affirms that Williams told
her several days ago he intended sellinc;
his furniture, which cost about $800, and
then leave the country.
On the showing made by the District
Attorney, Williams' bond was increased
to $4000 and a warrant issued for bis arrest.
j Marshal Baldwin had three deputiessnnt-
I ing for the ex-inspector all yesterday
afternoon and last nignt. Up to a late
I hour, however, they had failed to find any
I trace of him. His ontrinai bond consists
of cash put up by himself, and it is be
lieved that he has decided to forfeit it.
Williams has not been seen around the
Federal building since Monday. He called
on Collector Wise about 2 o clock in the
afternoon and then dropped from sight.
If he is still in the City Barry Baldwin
has been utterly unabie to find him. If
he has fled, then the probabilities are that
he has gone direct to Mexico, where he
would be free from molestation so far as
the American Government is concerned.
The attorneys representing Williams
deny that their client has leit the City or
has any intention of doing so. They say
he will remain here for trial and con
fidently expects to clear himself of the
grave charges now resting against him.
BANQUETED THE OFFICERS.

Friends Dined Together.
Last Wednesday evening the hall of
Borromean Council No. 129, Young Men's
Inatitute, at 2131 Mission street, was ra

" Indeed, cheap tea is reasonably
sure to be bad tea; but, unfortu-
nately, there is no guarantee of
purity in expensive tea."
{Brooklyn, N. X, Eagle).
Y^s, that is so; but the
slight coloring in finer tea
doesn't do much harm.
Perhaps, if your colored
tea suits you, you had bet-
ter keep on drinking it;
there are some people who
thrive excellently on poor
water and stale air.
But if you want tea as
the Chinese and Japanese
and other nations drink it
(pure and fresh), you must
get Schillings Best money-
back tea â at your grocer's.
And if you find that you
really don't like such tea â
why, get your money back.

WANTS THE MONEY.
Frank Bollinger Snes to Recover â¢2000
on a Relief Fund Certificate.
Frank Bollinger has sued the Supreme
Council of the Order of Chosen Friends,
Jeannettc Alfredetta Brown and Edith
Ellen Brown for $2000, alleged to be due
on a relief fund certificate payable at tbe
death of Mourning E. Bollinger, the de
ceased wife of plaintiff.
It seems that Bollinger and bis wife
each had a certificate issued in favor^cf
the other on condition that Bollinger
should pay the dues and assessments on
both. Shortly before Mrs. Bollinjjer'i
death she substituted Jeannette and Edith
Brown as beneficiaries in place of hejr
husband. It was claimed that this was in
violation of their agreement and without
the knowledge and consent of the plain
tiff. Therefore suit has been brought to
compel payment Â©f the $2000 to the bus

In the heart of the redwoods of Marin

THE OLD MILL.
Built 1837 :

Celebrate To-morrow Mgtat.
sawmill, the existence of which antedates
the famous Sutter mill, where John Mar
shall discovered gold in 1348.
The old millrace is dry, and the old mill
itself is in keeping with the stream that
lurnisbed its power. It is almost roofless,
and only the rough hewn logs remain to
attest the fact that uearly sixty years ago j
what is known as "Mill Valley" to-day
was a bigger settlement than the City of
San Francisco and its environs thrown in.
It is a beautiful spot the hardy pioneers
chose to make their home. It is right at
the foot of old Mount Tamalpais, on the
northern slope. Foothills rise on all sides,
and three generations of pines raise their
branches to lofty altitudes as if to protect
the dear old spot from the warm sun that
always beat? most torridly in the valley.
Right near the old mill the gentlemen
sports of the Mill Valley Country Club
took up their quarters. The place is called j
Millwood. Why it was ever given that
name is hard to say, for there is nothing
there but a vast expanse over which the
clubmen seem to rind enjoyment in out
door sports. There are lawn tennis, base
bail, cricket, inanimate target and golf
grounds enough to satisl'y the liking of
any enthusiast. But the club is homeless.
It has no house suitable to receive its
members, let alone its guests. The mem
bers are all. so to speak, men of wealth,
and they love to entertain well. Hereto
fore they have been obliged to receive
their friends al fresco, which, although a
delightful experience with such climate as i
Mlil Valley affords, left something lack
ing.
Now they want to build grand quarters
on their Millwood ground in keeping with
the place and the grandly wooded monn- !
tainslopesin Mill Valley only five minutes !
away.
To do this the members of the club have I
decided tney will introduce themselves to- j
morrow night to their friends and the
world at large. They will receive them in ;
what they consider the most picturesque ',
valley in the State, among the lofty pine j
trees and on the banks of a score of '
rippling streams where the trout await the :
hungry traveler and the doves fly over- i
head.
The forest will be highly illuminated. !
Red lights, Japanese lanterns and fire
works will brighten up the valley. The j
seven-mile road of the newly surveyed j
highway to the summit of Mount Tamal- !
pais will be aflame with red lightH, illumi
nating the way for the steamers crossing
the bay irom foggy San Francisch. The !
old mill will be decorated with buntine,
and tiie old wheel, which the water turned
sixty years ago and which has long since
fallen to piece?, will be replaced and will
revolve in a halo of pyrotechnics.
While all this is going on, a detachment
of artillery from the Presidio will fire
salutes, and the visitors will dance, sing |
and make merry in the inclosure, where
atereopticon views, living pictures by
Tivoli performers, and dancing a la Loie
Fuller will be seen, and happy speeches
will be made.

HIS PARTNER'S BUSINESS.
W. H. Hill Ran It Into the Ground and
Mil-. i Now Kxplaln Why.
Mrs. Fannie K. Chamberlain has
brought suit against W. H. Hill and J. G.
James to recover property belonging to
the estate of K. A. Chamberlain, her
deceased husband.
Chamberlain died on June 3, 1892. At
the time of his death he and Hill were
partners in the cattle business, Chamber
lain owning a two-thirds iuterest. The
complaint alleges that when Chamberlain
died the firm owned property worth $55, -
-000, consisting of twenty tons of wool,
12,000 sheep, 137 head of cattle, 150 hogs,
one bu.;;j-".v, one buckboard, three camping
outfits, office furniture and a butcher's
delivery wagon. Boot accounts amount
ing to ifoOOO were outstanding.
HiJl carried on the business up to Sep
tember 13, 1892, and it is- charged that he
ran things in a high-handed manner. He
is said to have wrongfully transferred so
much of the firm property to J. G. James
that he is now insolvent and unable to
give security for the share belonging to
Chamberlain. Although demanded an
accounting has been refused.
Mrs. Chamberlain, therefore, prays that
a receiver be appointed and the business of
the firm investigated. An accounting is
also asked for.
DILHAN LOST HER LOVE,
Ooce His Wife Thought His
Affection Worth Thousands
of Dollars.
Now She Is Willing to Leave the
Field Entirely Clear to Her
Rival.
Mrs. Grace A. Dilhan does not think as
much of Joseph, her husband, as she used
to. There was a time, not so very long
ago either, when she valued his affections
at $50,000 and sued Pierre de Loriol for
that araeunt for alienating them.
Of late, however, her ideas have under
gone a radical change. Now she thinks
so little of Joseph that she recently de
parted from the City, not even taking the
trouble to inform her husband of her des
tination. Therefore Joseph sued for a di
vorce. On Wednesday Mrs. Dilhan, being
an ultra - honest person, had the suit
against De Loriol dismissed.
The original complaint against De
Loriol is a curiosity in its way and created
something of a sensation when it was
hied. Following is an extract from it:
The plaintiff alleges â¢ * that heretofore
and within the two years next preceding the
commencement of this action, while Joseph
Dilhan was living happily with and support
ing the plaintiff, all of which the defendant
well knew, said defendant, â wrongfully intend
ing to injure the said plaintiff and deprive her
of the affection, society and companionship of
her husband, maliciously seduced and enticed
him away from the residence of plaintiff and
her said husband to a separate residence, and
has ever since detained and harbored him at
such separate residence against the ccnuent of
plaintiff nnd her peaceable efforts to prevent
it, anÂ«l has wholly alienated the affections of
the said Joseph Dilhan from tne plaintiff.
Wherefore $50,000 damages was de
manded. The demurrer to the complaint
was also peculiar. Among the reasons ad
vanced why the suit should be dismissed
were the following:
It cannot be ascertained from the complaint
whether the action is brought to recover dam
ages for alleged "seduction," "enticement" or
"harboring and detaining plaintiff's husband"
or "allenatinsr the affection of plaintiff's hus
band from plaintiff."
Evidently Mrs. Dilhan, thinking
Joseph's love and affection is not worth
having, is averse to trying to make Mr. de
Loriol pay for something she considers
worth nothing.
When Baby was sick, we gave her Castoria.
When Bhe was a Child, she cried for Castoria,
When she became Bliss, she clung to Castoria.
When she had Children, she gave them Castoria,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 17, 1896.
PORTLAND GAINS
AT OUR EXPENSE,
Southern Pacific Extortion
Causes All the
Trouble.
SEVEN VESSELS LAID UP
Merchandise They Formerly Car
ried Now Goes From
Oregon.
HAWAII MERCHANTS PLEASED
Cheap Railroad Rates to Port'and
Mean a Clear Saving to Them
of $2 a Ton.
The Southern Pacific is slowly but
surely ruining the shipping interests of
San Francisco. Its suicidal policy in
charging "all the traffic will bear" has
started opposition steamship lines from
British Columbia, Seattle, Tacoma and
Portland.
The advent of the Valley road has com
pelled the Southern Pacific to cut its rates
in that direction, but from all other points
the old tariff prevails and the commerce
of this port is suffering and Portland is
benefited.
Not so very long ago all the feedstuff
used in the Hawaiian Isles went from San
Francisco. Now the Portland merchants
can ship it to Honolulu and sell it from $2
to $3 a ton under California prices. Hay,
feed and flour are all going from Oregon,
ana in consequence many locally owned
vessels are either laid up or have been
sent off shore. The following well-known
Hawaiian traders are amon^ the number;
The R. P. Rithet is seeking a foreign char
ter, the S. C. Allen is waiting for some
thing to turn up. the steamer Jvahului is
laid up, the Robert Lewers ia going to
Australia with wheat and the Mohican
and Archer are preparing to follow suit.
When the Martha Davis and one or two
others arrive from Honolulu they also
will join the idle fleet, unless in the mean
time the unexpected happens and freights
improve.
Another of the fleet is the bark Ceylon.
Finding that there was no chance of se
curing a cargo hero, Captain Calhoun has
accepted a charter to load lumber at Puget
Bound.
"It simply amounts to this," said a
prominent shipper yesterday; "the rail
road rates into Portland are away below
w at they are to San Francisco. In con
sequence, the farmers! can iand their
goods in Portland and the merchants can
ship them at just that luuch less than we
can. V- ssels get j. radically the same
freight rates there as they -io from this
port, and. in consequence, we are under
sold in our own marfcet. We have to take
Hawaiian su>;ar because we need it, but if
things do not mend pretty soon, we won't
be in it with the web:oct State,"
As a result of the Southern Pacific's
grab-ail policy, quite a number of steam
schooners carrying freight at $1 a ton have
been put on between the various coast
ports. These vessels play into the hands
of the Oregon merchants, and while Collis
P. Huntington smiles a grim smile in his
New York sanctum, t^ie San Francisco
merchant smiles on the other side of his
mouth.
THEATRICAL NOTES.
Continued Snrceas of the Grand Opera
Seasonâ "Carmen" an a Drama
Makes a Groat Hit.
Grand opera that is really grand and
genuine opera, keeps the Tivoli well
filled. The presentation of "Kigoletto"
does honor to the management and
to the artists in the cast. Because
Natali does not storm and shout,
some would-be critics have called her
voice weak. Such talk must amuse the
, real crictics who flock to hear her.
Michelena and Pache shone to special ad
advantage last nitrht.
The chorus has been somewhat aug
mented, which gives a more perfectly
rounded ensemble. "Romeo and Juliet
will be given to-night.
At the California the spectacular and
dramatic version of "Carmen" is proving
very attractive. To be sure, one misses
the delightful music of the opera, but as a
play the work is deserving of high praise.
Miss Coghlan and Mr. Warde are well
supported by Mr. Stockwell's company,
and it looks as though "Carmen" in a
new dress had come to stay.
Great success has erected the revival of
"The Charity Ball" at the Columbia. The
Frawleys are so finished in their methods
and so harmonious in their work that the
large audiences seem to be delighted with
them.
The tramp is king at the Grand Opera
bouse and his reign seems destined to be
long. Mr. Walters does some splendid
work in "Sidetracked." The play gives
him a chance to display some tine points,
until now held in reserve, and they carry
the bouse by storm.
The Orpheum presents a fine vaudeville
bill which keeps the audiences large and
interested. The dog, monkey and baboon
circus, under the management of Mr.
Macart, is one of the most interesting
things of the kind ever seen here.
Performances at the Casino, both in the
aiternoon and at night, are very well at
tended. Captain Beach, "the human
hsh," the Marlow-Dunhams on the tra
peze and other specialty artists continue
to present a very enjoyable programme.
FOR STEALING MILK.
l.cvi B. Gordon Sentenced to One
Yenr in the County .fail.
Levi B. Gordon, an ex-polireman and
milkman, appeared before Judge Oonlan
yesterday morning for sentence. He was
convicted on Monday on two charges of
petty larceny for stealing milk from the
doorsteps of residents in the Mission and
Western Addition.
Attorney Tread well, for the defendant,
asked the Judge to be merciful for the
sake of his wife and family, who would be
the real sufferers if he were sent to jail.
The Judge said that Gordon should
have thought of his wife and family before
he commenced to steal. A large number
of criminals were in the same po.-ition as
Gordon in that respect and he could make
no exception in his case. He regretted for
the sake of Gordon's wife and family that
he could not take into consideration a
plea for leniency. He would sentence the
defendant to six months in the County
jail on each of the two charges.
Attorney Tread well pave notice of ap
peal and the Judge fixed the bonds in
$1000 in each case.
Time for Crittenden.
Judge Hebbard yes'erday granted Attorney J.
L. Crittenden twenty days' more time in which
to prepare a bill of exceptions to the order of
Judge Slack.vhich adjudged Crittenden guilty
ana punished him for contempt of court.
Judge Slack ia away on vacation.
THE FIRST MALE DEER.
Georee Jackson and Sam Hughes Are
Kow Pronounced Mighty
Hunters.
George Jackson and Sam Hnghes, two
of the champion inanimate target-smash
ers of the Olympic Gun Club, returned
Wednesday evening from Halfmoon Bay
with a forked-horn deer, which weighed
125 pounds when dressed.
Mr. Hughes was somewhat delicate in
stating who had shot the monarch of the
canyons, but when pressed for a reply he
acknowledged that the bullet from Jack
son 8 "fie there" just a shade ahead
of the pellet he sent in tne same direction.
Hugnes invited his friends to visit his
place of business on Powell and Post
streets to see the beauty.
"We packed him ten miles on our
backs, said Hughes, "before we reached

in the bargain I caught a eood dose of
poison oak. True sportsmen do not mind
those little things, you know."
RIGHTS OF F REIGN CONSULS.
Supreme Court Decides They Are Not
ClTilly Subject to Mtate Tribunals.
In the case of Wilcox versus Luco, the
question at issue being as to the jurisdic
tion of the Superior Courts in civil cases
over the persons of foreign Consuls, the
Supreme Court, in an orjinion filed yester
day, says:
Under our system the Government of the
l nited States is the only sovereign having re
lations with foreign countries under the law
of nations; and all dealings with the repre
sentatives of foreign nations must be by the
courts or other agencies of the Government,

which is alone sovereign in that regard. It is
the right and privilege of the foreign govern
ment to be thus treated. We think, therefore,
that un'ier the provisions. >)f the copstitution
of the United States there was no jurisdiction
of the case at bar in the Superior Court of this
State.
ATTORNEYS IN CONTEMPT
Patrick Reddy Calls Warner
Temple a Liar in Judge
Campbell's Court.
Both Tender an Apology and the Judge
Purges Them of the Contempt
Proceedings.
The proceedings in Judge Campbell's
court yesterday morning were enlivened
by a prominent attorney calling his
learned friend a liar, and both being ad
judged in contempt of court.
It occurred during the hearing of the
case of T. A. Burns, produce merchant,
109 Seventh street, charged with felony
embezzlement. Burns was appointed re
ceiver by the creditors interested in Mey
er's restaurant on Ellis street, and two of
tne waiters had him arrested for felony
embezzlement, as they had not been paid
their claims.
Attorney Warner Temple appeared as
apecir.l prosecutor and Attorney Patrick
Reddy represented the, defendant.
Attorney Temple, in opening the case,
remarked that he would prove that the de
fendant, Burns, was a scamp and bad man
generally.
Attorney Reddy wan on his feet in a
moment and looking Temple square in
the face said, slowly and deliberately : "If
you say that you are a liar."
"Come, come, gentlemen," said Judge
Camobeli, a? he rapped for order, "I can
not permit such language in this court. I
will adjudge you both guilty of con
tempt."
This had the effect of bringing the two
attorneys to their senses and Temple
promptly tendered an apology to Ready.
"Knowing your reputation as a gentleman
and a lawyer," he said, "I was wrong in
referring to one of your clients as a scamp
and bad man."
"Then I retract my statement," replied
Attorney Reddy, and the Judge promptly
purged them both of contempt.
After hearing the evidence the Judge
dismissed the case, as he said it was purely
a matter for the civil courts.
Beat Her With a Club.
Mrs. Gertrude Fink, ISI4 Kearny street,
swore to a complaint Jn JuJge Joachimsen's
court yesterday, charging Conrad Yung, a
neighbor, with assault with a deadly weapon.
Wednesday night she was standing on her back
porch when Yung came out of his hou<e with
a club and beat her over the head and face
with it. The Judge said he was sorry he could
not give her a warrant for assault to murder.

LORD OF A
MIGHTY FOREST,
D. Ward of Detroit, the
Patriarch of Lumber
Dealers.
WILL EXAMINE TIMBER.
Has Come to Learn What to
Expect From Future
Competition.
BUILT MILES OF RAILROAD.
Almost an Octogenarian and Planning
to Meet Conditions He Expects
Years Hence.
D. Ward, who owns more land than any
other man in Michigan, and who has built
160 miles of railroad on his property with.
out borrowing a dollar from any one to do
it, is at the Russ.
He has come to,this coast to make a per
sonal study of the lumber industry and to
learn the possibilities of the future compe
tition of the forests of the iar West with
those of Michigan. Wisconsin and Minne
sota, which have the advantage of being
convenient to me great lumber markets of
the United States.
Mr. Ward Las lived in Michigan for the
last sixty years. He owns in that State
200,000 acres of forest land covered with
big timber, none of which has yet been
cut, except in the narrow avenues opened
for his railroad and its numerous spur
tracks that branch into different parts of
the virgin lumber region.
"I have been a land-owner and surveyor
for sixty-five years," said ne, "but of
course I wasn't at it all the time. I began
as a boy. lam a boy yet.
"Fifty years ago I planned to get pos
session of big lumber regions, and forty
two years ago I bought the 300,000 acres
that I own at presentâ most of it at ten
bits an acre. I have owned other forest
land, twice that amount altogether, but
have cut the timber on it and sold it from
time to time.
"I was in San Francisco twenty-five
years ago, but this time I have come to
see the redwood forest* of California and
the lumber regions about Puget Sound. I
have seen all the other lumber districts in
America. I have read, a good deal about
these, but I thought l ought to come and
have a look with my own eyes. I thought
I owed it to myself before I died.
"I want to determine the prospects
twenty or thirty years ahead and be guided
in my purchases and preparations.
"There 1 have 200,000 acres of big timber
âwhite pine and other hard woodâ and
not a tree cut; about 2,000,000,000 feet of
lumber on the ground and a railroad all
laid but. It has taken me eight years to
build the railroad. There is no private
railroad built by one man in the United
States like it, and no such tract of timber
owned by one man either. What's more,
I don't owe anybody a dollar. I want to
see just what lumber there is cut here and
how dangerous tne competition is to be in
the forest regions several years hence.
"There is more than enough timber on
this coast to supply the local markets, the
Japanese, the Mexican and Central Ameri
can trade. The surplus product mast find
its way across the Rockies and into the
main marKets of the country. But we are
nearer those markets and have both water
and railroad transportation. For some
time the Southern States have oeen ship
ping their yellow pine north â yes, way up
our wayâ and Canada, with her free trade, |
has been sending over lumber to compete !
against Michigan, Wisconsin and Minne
sota.
"For several years Michigan cut as high :
as 7,000,000,000 feet of lumber a year, and
Wisconsin from 3,000,000,000 to 4,000,000,
-000. Saginaw alone turned out 1,200.000,
-000 feet a year for several years running.
"In the last lifty years teat town has |
furnished folly 40,000,000,000 feet of white
pine lumber. The output from those
States is not so great as it used to be. But
the market is near us and the advantage
should certainly be with us. The Missis
sippi Valley and the East is the great
lumber market of America. For fifty â for
100 yearsâ lumber will be used in larger
and larger quantities. To enter that mar
ket this coast must stand heavy transpor
tation charges."
Mr. Ward says he is a Republican and a
believer in protection to American indus
tries by a tariff sufficient to pay the ex
penses of govennient. He characterizes
the Democratic platform as "that anar
chist ticket they got up at Chicago."
BOXING AND HANDBALL.
The Olympic Club Has Made Complete
Arrangements for Its Tourna
ments.
The Olympic Club completed arrange
ments Wednesday for its boxing festival
on the evening of the 31st inst. and for the
handball tournament which will com
mence this evening in the Occidental
Court, on Grove street.
The boxing programme is as follows:
Jack Davis of Omaha and T. Van Buskirk
of the Olympic Club, heavy-weights, eight
rounds; T. H. Smith and Danny Ma
honey, 115 pounds, eight rounds; George
Green (Young Corbett) and Bob McArthur.
catch weights, four rounds; F. Butler of
the San Francisco Athletic Club and
Charley Rochctte, 135 pounds, eight
rounds.
Manager Kennedy, who has charge of the
boxing end of the club's affairs, says that
he is negotiating for a match between
Griffo and George Lavigne and that there
is no truth in the report that he tele
graphed to Peter Maher's manager that
the club would defray the expenses of the
pugilist to thia City provided that the pro
posed contest between Maher and Choyn
ski would be held under the auspices of
the club.
L. Agnews, who journeyed from the
East to this City with Joe Choynski, met
E. Sullivan in the gymnasium of the club
Wednesday evening. Agnews proved he
was clever and a good puncher. He hit Sul
livan as he pleased in the first round and
stopped him in the second round.
STILL ANOTHER FENDER.
This One Comes From San Lais Obispo
and "Is Simplicity Itself."
E. Groat, a mechanical engineer of San
Luis Obispo, is the latest inventor of a
streetcar fender, and he claims that it is
the least cumbersome of the many hereto
fore brought to public notice and that "it
is simplicity itself." It consists of an
apron, or scoop, across the entire width of
the track, placed just in front of the for
ward wheels. The front of this when in
position is about eight inches above the
track. At the outer edge of the platform
of the car there is a swinging gate that is
also as wide as the track, and this, when it
comes in contact with an object, moves in
ward and upward. This is connected by
a catch or lever with the apron and with a
bell.
The moment an object touches the
swinging gate the catch is released, the
scoop front drops to the ground and the
springs that Hold it are so arranged that
when the object that caused the gate to
fly back touches it, it does not raise and
nothing can get under it. When tiie
catch is released a loud bell is sounded,
and that gives the man in charge of the
car notice to put down his brakes and to
either take off the grip or the electric cur
rent, as the case may be. Mr. Groat
claims that the cost of putting his fender
on a car will not exceed $5.

The California Populist Del

Unsymboled, Unheralded and Un
adorned, It Noisily Rat
tles Away.
tWOEN TO INDOBSE NO OKE.
Say They Will Nominate Tte'r Man
and Draft an Entirely New
Platform.
The California delegation of the Peo
ple's party departed early yesterday morn- j
ing for the St. Louis arena with a lack of '
uc ueiegates to tne convention or the People's Party Bidding Farewell to Their Friends at th
Oakland Mole.
pomp and circumstance and gplendo r and
outwardly expressed enthusiasm that has
seldom en equaled in the going of any
representative political body to the scene
vi a miguty struggle.
With that name "don't-care-a-c-nt" or
"^ive-a-cent" spirit that prompted Thomas
fTeMon to ride down to the White House
on a piebald mare on the day of his in
auguration, the PonulieU left for the far
East in a straw-seated puritanical tourist
car.'. V; ;.'â¢ â¢ '.-.:.-.-.. - â¢ -V; .
The car was devoid of decoration or any
symbol, without pr within, which, might
inform the most curious observer that in
side its. ramshackle exterior were fifteen
earnest-minded men who had nobly sacri
fired Pullman luxury lor a simplicity cal
culated to harmonise with their party's
name.
At a few minutes before 7 o'clock yester
day morning the delegation stood in the
ferry depot, the delegates clad in linen
d asters and straw hats. Dr. Day wait,
from the Fifth District, betrayed his party,
however, so far as to sport a shining silk
tile, but he was the only Judas of ' the lot.
The homespun shirts and knitted socks
of the delegates were carried in bulging
carpetsacks and well-worn valises. The
baggageman rested his voice. His services
â¢were not required, for the Populist?, each
man of them, bravely piloted hia individ
ual burden, humming the refrain, "For
we you know are the people," with . mel
ancholy countenance.
"Why do we go in an â¢migrant car?"
said Taylor Rogers, in a surprised tone of
voice, as he proudly buttoned bis linen
duster about him and took a firmer grip
on his straw valise. "Because we are all
poor, sir, every one of us. It is the way
we should . travel. Are we not the peo
ple?" â¢; .
There was no cheering crowd or brass
band awaiting at the mole to nee the dele
gation aboard . Neither was there a flut
tering of ribbons or nags or lay colored
handkerchiefs. Everything was dene
quietly and impressively. Neither were
there any hampers of wines stored unaer
the well-ventilated seats. On the trip
across the bay a last grab was made for
comfort in the cabin of the steamer Oak
land. It was noticeable that not oue
Populist remained below to .enjoy a cigar
and the simplicity of unupuolstered
benches.
There was a fog on the bay and about
the mole, and the train was bedewed with
moisture as it drew out, a fact which
seemed emblematic of the mission of the
little party that intends to do so much
toward dispersing the obscurity of the Na
tional political atmosphere.
"These seats," sighed Alfred Daggett,
as he rested on the straw covered bench,
"remind me of the tire on my boy's
bicycle; but I suppose we will accustom
ourselves to them in time." â â '- ;
At Sacramento the remaining twenty
two delegates joiped the party from this
City, and at Ogden another tourist car will
be attached to increase the â¢ accommoda
tions. The complete list of the California!
delegates who will attend the convention!
at St. Louis on the 22d is as follows: I

Delegate J. R. Weich, City Attorney for
San Jose, said ; "We will not indorse any
body, but we will nominate our Presi
dential candidate. We have 2,500,000 voters
in the United States. We are already a
> ational party, and are recognized as such â¢
therelore we will not surrender our rights
either to the Democrats or to the Republi.
cans. Ihe Democratic party is ihe'third
party in seventeen Spates, and in those
States I believe we are first or sscond.
"If Bryan be nominated he will be nom
inated a3 a Populist, not as a Democrat,
nor will we indorse him as such. He will
have to come and stand squarely on the
platform made at Bt. Louis by us. That
platform will be a brand-new document.
1 do not expect it will incorporate all the
features of the Omaha platform and per
haps it may not materially differ from the
Chicaco Democratic plaiiorm.
"There are a great many obstacles in
the way of nominating Bryan. The Peo
ple's party is not a free-traile party; It is a
protection party and believes in the prin
ciples of protection. It further believes in
the restriction of foreign imniigration and
believes this the one true principle of pro
tection for our laboring classes.
"I am not in favor of nominating Mr.
Debs and I would prefer Teller to Bryan.
It is very probuble, however, that the St.
Louis convention may nominate some
such man as Judge Caldwell of Nebraska."
E. M. Wardall, chairman of the delega
tion, said that it was very probable that a
poll for choice of Presidential candidate
would be taken on the train soon after
leavinp Sacramento, the result of which
would be made public.
Mr. Day wait said: "We have a very
positive idea of what we want, and our
course is now simply to formulate a plan.
I anticipate very little trouble at the
eonvintiou. I believe that harmony will

prevail, and that the work we accomplish
will be memorable."
J. C Gore of the' fourth district taken a
diametrically opposite view. "I am afraid
tbe man with the horns will get into the
convention," said be, sands 'and play havoc.
It is impossible at this time to predict the
choice of the convention. If it be Bryan

ho will be regularly nominated, and must
pledge himself to the People's party plat
form, which does not conflict with the
Democratic. I know quite positively
thougn that Bewail will never be ac
cepted as tbe Vice-Presidential nominee."
"The People's party," said Taylor
Rojrers, "will accept nominees from no
Darty. It will elect its own. To indorse a
candidate of another party would mean
I the absorption of our party into the other.
| We will Btand firmly for some pood man.
I can't say who it will be. Yes, Caldwell
is an excellent man and is immensely
popular in the party."
The delegation w"ill arrive at Bt. Louis
Sunday evening, and until the convention
on Wednesday, the 22d, a convention will
be held in which the question of direct
legislation will be discuhsed.
SILVERITES DEPART.
The St. Louis Delegation Proclaims
Its Stand for Bryan.
The California delegation to the Silver
Convention at St. Louis departed on the
first-class overland train last evening.
A party of about thirty occupied two
Pullman sleepers, the sides of which were
draped with gay bunting and covered with
long banners proclaiming "California
Delegation to National Silver Convention"
and some lf> to 1 sentiments. The banners
also proclaimed the fact that the delega
tion is out for Bryan, his picture orna
menting the center of two of the banners.
The appointment of the delegation and
the arrangements for tbe trip were quite
completely controlled by George W. Baker,
who is chairman of thÂ« Oalifornia organi
zation and member for this State of the
National Committne of the American Bi
metallic Union. Mr. Baker is a personal
friend of Bryan, and he expects, to see the
candidate while passing through' Lincoln,
Nebr.
The Silver delegation is not a full one.
The State is entitled to forty-five delegates
under the convention call, but it will actu
ally consist of about twenty-live. Its com
plete roll cannot be made up until after
St. Louis is reached, but it stood as fol
lows yesterday:
George W. Baker, c. N\ Harris. Henry I.
Willey, Charles D. Lane, A. H. Pile, Dr. W . A.
DicKinson. A. H. Rlultetts, Hiiro Hornlein,
Frank J. Moffitt, E. H. W'oolsey, Kobert McKil

Moore, Colusa; John R. Berry, Christopher
Gosch, John Love, Dr. D. VV. Hunt, Los An
geles ; R. W. Thomas, Hector McLain, J. M
Jones, G. J. Chambers, Jesse GUmour.
Of these, Henry I. Willey, John F.
Flyr.n and George P. Keenuy are now in
the East. Some will go by other routes,
and at St. Louis some appointments will
be made as opportunity offers.
The delegation travels by the Union Pa
cific route and will reach St. Louis at
about the same time as the Populist dele
gation, which goes by the Missouri Pacific.
PLANS AGAINST FUNDING,
They Are Discussed by the Ccm
mittee Appointed by the
Mass-Meeting.
It Is the General Opinion That A'l
Efforts Should Be Concentrated
on Congressmen.
About eighteen members of the anti
funding committee appointed at the re
cent anti-funding mass-meeting met at the
office of Mayor Sutro in the new City Hall
to discuss plans for the coming campaign.
While no formal plan was decided upon
it was the undivided opinion of all pres
ent that the efforts cf the campaign com
mittee should be mainly directed toward
securing the return of a solid anti-fund
ing Congressional delegation at the fall
election.
Mayor Sutro presided, and in calling the
meeting to order he made some brief but
pointed remarks on what he thought was
necessary to do. He declared that the
great fi^ht of the people of this State in
the approaching battle of ballots was to
elect men who could be depended upon to
defeat any and all measures to defer the
day of settlement of the Southern Pacific
Company.
Others coincided with the views ex
pressed by Mayor Sotro and gave it as their
opinion that large quantities of literature
ought to be used as a means of educating
the people on this phase of the political
situation. It was absolutely necessary, they
declared, to elect Congressmen who would
vote against refunding the Central Pacific's
debt to the Government; that all local is
sues should be sacrificed for this object.
George K. Fitch, while having no par
ticular line of action to suggest, was in
favor of a prompt move to defeat the
machinations of the railroad company in
the campaign now near.
George W. Montieth scored the railroad
for its methods of political chicanery as he
termed it, and declared that its 'emis
saries were already at work laying the
foundation for the election of men to Con
gress whom it could control.
An adjournment was taken until next
Thursday morning.
BAUMANN DREW
HiS REVOLVER,
A Dairyman Hurls Defi
ance at the Health
Authorities.
STOOD GUARD OVER COWS
He Refused to Allow Them to
Be Killed by the In
spectors.
DR. LOVELACE COMPROMISES.
A S cond Test for Tuberculosis Will
Bj Made Before They Are
Ciniemned.
Bloodshed was narrowly averted at the
Swiss Alpine Dairy on the fc'an liruno
road yesterday when Milt Inspector Dook
ery and Market Inspector Davis of the
Board of Health called to remove cows
condemned under the tuberculin tests ap
plied several days ago.
The instant they made known their er
rand one of the Baumann brothers, who
conduct the establishment, drew a mur
derous-looking revolver and after cocking
it, and while carelessly playing with the
trigger, announced that be would kill any
one who attempted to Kill nis cowa.
Those wbo witnessed the exciting scene
aver that both of the inspectors displayed
remarkable agility in getting behind their
buggy when the irate dairyman produced
his weapon, and that their voices were as
gentle as those of tbe cooing doves when
they opened negotiations for peace Irom
behind their retreat.
lkiumann announced that ha was not
sntished with the tebta of his cows, and
that there were not enough inspectors in
the Health Department to take his bovines
before he had been convinced beyond a
doubt that the cows were dangerous to the
community. The inspectors, after a con
sultation, went to the nearest telephone
and called up police headquarters, with
the idea of netting assistance, but their
hopes in that direciion were soon d%shed,
as the scene of the difficulty being outside
of this county, Chief Crowlev did not see
that he had any authority to interfere.
in their extremity the inspectors tele
phoned to Health Officer Lovelace. He
and Inspector Sullivan hurried out to
the ranch to prevent the complete annihil
ation of their subordinates. Lovelace's
imposing appearuuee and his confidence
in his own authority had no more effect
on the dairyman than bad the inspectors'
honeyed words, and the dairyman per
â iMed in his determination to. keep his
cows until satistied that they were really
diseased.
The Health Officer and the three in
spectors bel<4 a council of war and par
tially decided to charge the enemy, but
Baumann and his gun looked very formid
able, and it was linally decided to resort to
arbitration. The dairyman was asked his
reasons for resistance and cheerfully gav
them. He slated that when he was told
his herd was to be examined he had not
taken advantage of the provision of the
law allowing him to have Vfcterinaries of
his own choosing present, because his
cows looked so sleek and healthy that he
did not believe any of them could be sick.
He was horrified when he learned that at
least thirty and perhaps thirty-rive out of
his herd of lifty-eight must be killed.
"I am not sure that the test was cor
rect," he said, in conclusion, "and those
cows will not be taken off this place until
I know it (s all right."
The party, including Baumann, finally
adjourned to Dr. Lovelace's office, in this
City, where after a long conference the
authorities agreed to make another test of
the cows, at which Baumann might have
his own veterinaries.
The dairyman signed an agreement to
abide by the decision of this second test.
Then Brumanu returned to his rancb and
his cows, and the health authorities
breathed easier.
SAT DOWN ON POPPER.
Hi* Credentials From the Junta Placed
on File by the Election
Commissioners.
After sitting down hard on Max Popper,
alleged leader of the Junta, the Election
Commissioners went into necret session
yesterday to select the names of those who
will serve as election officers during the
com ing election.
Representing tbe Buckley faction of the
Democracy was Attorney Rothchild, who
wanted a lot of men selected by the
"regulars" appointed as officers.
The Commissioners, when they received
Popper's credentials from the County
Committee that he represents, quietly
placed them on Hie much to the Junta
man's chagrin and the consequent trie* of
Attorney Rothchild. Nearly the "entire
afternoon was spent in going over lists of
names presented by the Republican County
Committee and from the Democratic
clubs of the various Assembly districts
with a view to selecting competent
oflicials.

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
Â»TW YORK. N. V..' July 16â The liquidations
which have been such conspicuous features of
trading at the Stock Exchange during the past few
days continued during the early session. It is true
that at the start the market was irregular in its
course and in some cases there was more disposi
tion to buy, but the advances which took place
were soon lost, and the selling toward 11 o'clock
was vigorously renewed. Reports of heavy gold
exports, the Illness, of Cornelius Vaoderolit and
the fears of a third ticket in the Presidential race
were all used with effect against the market. As
on yesterday, there were signs of demoralization
and the sales by holders whose margins bad been
exhausted formed an Important part oi the trans
actions. ..
Luke Shore tumbled 5*4 to 137 V*. while the
other prominent issues fe.l any where from y* to
3i 2 I'Â«t cent. Nickel Plate second preferred, a
Vanderbilt stock, brought 23 against MO, the last
previously reported sale. About 1 o'clock there
was a let-up in selling from all quarters and the
market beaan to recover. Confidence slowly re
turned and in the last hour the market exhibited
eater strength than at any other time of the day.
ThÂ» recovery was 'he result of reports that the
gold shipments; to Europe on Saturday will fall
below- previous estimates, that the sound money
Democrats had given up the idea of nominating a
third ticket, and that the Morgan- Beimont syndi
cate stood realy to take bonds â¢In sufficient
amounts to protect the treasnry gold reserve. *
shorts were the heaviest buyers in the late trad-
Ing, and their purchases led to a recovery of J/ 2 @5

VIOLENT KECOED OF ONE DAY.
Three Ooron?r's Cases, One Case of
Shooting to Create Sympathy and
a Serious Accident.
Oakland Orncz Ban Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 16. J
The record of violence to-day is longer
and more ghastly than for any day in
many years. Two suicides, one death by
drowning, one attempted suicide and one
serious carriage accident that may yet
prove fatal completes the list.
Elizabeth Van Wye k, a young lady 23
years of age, committed suicide to-day at
the beautiful house overlooking Lake Mer
ritt where she lived with her brothers and
sisters.
Miss Van Wyck has been under the in
fluence of a suicidal mania fora longtime,
and about a month ago she made an at
tempt to jump from the second-story win
dow. Her relatives were aware of her
weakness and kept a constant espionage
on her movements, and also removed from
her sight every sharp instrument, the
presence of which might create a fatal
desire.
This morninc the rest of the family
were at breakfast when they heard their
sister fall at the foot of tbe stairway.
They went to her and discovered that she
was on the verge of death. A razor, a
pool of blood and the appearance of her
throat to!d the whole of the story. The
unhappy girl had been overtaken by a fit
of melancholia and had evidently sought
for and found a razor, wnile her brothers
and sister thought she was still sleeping.
The Van Wvcks are the children of the
late Dr. J. C. Van Wyck. They lived in a
house on Boulevard Heights, which they
occupied jointiv. Their home is in the
mosi aristocratic part of the city, and the
deceased was a great social favorite. The
family returned from Santa Cruz a few
weeks ago, and Miss Van Wyck has been
under treatment by Dr. Akerly ever since.
An inquest was held at the house this
afternoon, and her relatives told their
&torv.
Left His Body to Students.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 16.â Early this
morning the Coroner was uotihed that
tnere was a dead body on the east shore of
Lake Merritt. When the Deputy Coroner
reached the lake be found a man uncon
scious, but still livine. rie at once im
provised an ambulance out of the morgue
wagon and drove to the Receiving Hos
pital.
Dr. Dunn and Steward Victory worked
for hours over the man, but although they
partly restored him to animation the
poison which he had taken proved too
deadly to admit of relief and death re
sulted this afternoon.
Tne man, wfiose name is probably A.
Kernin, appears to have been a tramp.
His property consists of two needles ana
some thread, a pair of eyeglasses and a
pipe. On his right arm are the words,
"Independence Hose," and on tne left one
the letters "A. Kernin."
On a piece of paper found in a pocket
were these words: "Give my body to the

Lake Merritt Yesterday.

nin.''
The deceased is about 50 years old ana
of moderate build.
Found In the Day.
OAKLAND, Cai.., July 16.â T. Shahan
of the EureJta Hotel found the corpse of a
roan floating in the bay near the mole this
morning. From bis appearance the Coro
ner thinks the man is a lineman. He had
not been in the water long. He was
dressed in blue overalls and jumper. The
features suggest that the deceased is a
Portuguese. The body is at the morgue
awaiting identification.
Shot Himself to Create Sympathy.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 16.â George Gor
don shot himself last nieht to create
sympathy. He did not attempt suicide
nor did he meet murderous footpads. He
was out of work and despondent, and had
not enough to pay for his breakfast.
He made a confession to-day. "My
true name," he said, "is Peter Gordon. 1
registered aa Peter Goldburg so that my
brother, who discharged me, would not
know where I am. I did not try to kill
myself, if i had wanted to commit sui
cide I could have done it with one shot.
I had only 50 cents. I owed 25 cents for a
m Â«al at "Ruedy's. If I bad slept there
IÂ»Â«t night 1 would have had to pay 75
cents, and I had only 50 cents.
"I had a revolver. 1 had five bullet?. I
fired lour of them into the air. The last I
nred so that :t would slightly touch my j
forehead. I knew I would attract the at
tention of the people by firing the shots
and if 1 hurt myself a little I would go
into the hospital. No, I don't want to
die."
Gordon's injuries are very slight, ana
he will be dircharged from the hospital
to-morrow to face the common enemy.
Mrs. McÃÂ«an Seriously Injured.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 16.â Mrs. Alex
ander McÃean, a leader of local society,
was thrown from her buggy to-day and
seriously injured. Her cofiar bone is frac
tured and she received internal injuries.
Mrs. McÃean was in her buggy, waitine
J or * lad y guest, when her horse took
fright. The animal ran into a brick wall,
overturned the buggy and tnrew tbe oc
cupant on the sidewalk. It continued its
solitary career downtown till it was
stopped. Mrs. McÃean was picked up by
friends and carried into ber house. Her
injuries are very severe. The horse was
badly bruised and cut before being stopped.
TO MAKE DRY LAND.

a Landmark.
OAKLAND, Cal., July 16â At 2p. M.
yesterday the whistles of the Dalton
Foundry. California Sash and Door Com
pany and the Southern Pacific Railroad,
with the booming of anvils and the wav
ing of flags, announed the beginning of the
work of falling in the marsh land at the
north end of Pine street from the foot of
Lincoln street to the Sixteenth-street

This place has been used in times past
for a baptismal font. Thirteen years ago
the Baptists immersed candidates in its
waters, which changed with every tide.
At a meeting ol the West Oakland Im

evening, W. S. Palmer, resident engineer
of the Southern Pacific Company, attended
and received tne subscription of the club
for this work. He commended their in

HILBORN'S MIND FAILED
Forgot That He Is Exempt and
Paid Poll Tax and
Penalty.
The "Mayor of Piedmont" Informed
Him That He Had Wasted
Thiee Dollars.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 16. $
Congressman Hilborn forgot his age to
day and his forgetfulness cost him $3.
j The Congressman was walking along
| Broadway meditating on the manner in
i whicn he had helped to defeat the funding
bill when Deputy Collector Maloon stopped
i him.
"You have not paid your poll-tax," said
Maloon.
"Well, well, that's so," said the man
from Washington, banding the collector $2.
"Another dollar, please; it's delinauent
now," said Maloon authoritatively."
" Here you are," said Mr. Hilborn, and
after taking a receipt he walked away.
A moment later he was accosted by P.
J. Keiler, "Mayor of Piedmont." Keller
had watched the whole proceeding.
"What were yon doing, Hilborn?" asked
Keller.
â¢'Paying my polltax. I don't believe
that any man should avoid paying his
quota toward the support of the public
schools," and the Congressman was pro
ceeding to give the man from Piedmont
some good advice, when Keller inter
rupted.
"Look here, Hilborn; you've thrown
away $3." he said. "You are over 60 years
of age and the law exempts you from poll
tax. I thought you knew that."
Then the Congressman remembered his
age and repented.
There was some amusement in the As
sesÃor's office when Maloon made his re
turns, as everybody knows that Mr. Hil
born is long exempt.

lar Salvation Army standard. The young I
couple was tied securely enough, but it i
has started out in double harness some
what handicapped when compared with
the principals of all the other army wed
dings that have been solemnized in public-
Captain and Mm. Holmes left tbe plat- i
form without the advice of the noted War
Cry editor, Staff-Captain Milsaps. tor ten
years Editor Milsaps has been a prominent
figure at army weddings. He has always
been very lavish with his advice, and al
though he has never yet mustered enough
courage to go through the ordeal per
sonally, he has always proved capable of
imparting more advice than all the mar
ried officers in the coast division. Being
bald and a bachelor. Editor Milsaps has
been a standing joke for many years.
Some time ago he was transferred East
and his absence from to-nieht's wedding
was as noticeable as though the groom
had been absent.
The bride and groom are both yonng.
Captain Holmes has been an officer about
two years. Previous to that he was a
cadet in the Oakland training garrison. I
Captain Nettie Swan graduated from the I
woman's garrison in San Francisco about
a year ago. The groom and bride wore
the plain uniform ot the army, and across
the shoulder of tbe latter was a p'.ain white
sash, which is all the decoration allowed
by the army ritual.
The band from the headquarters in San
Francisco played a lively march as the
bridal party entered. Mendelssohn did
not write that march, but that cut no
figure, it was a wedding march just the
same.
When the principals were grouped on
the platform Brigadier Keppel produced
the army regulations and proceeded to
read. The army doctrine is very plain in
regard to marriage. It may not convey
the same idea to a Salvationist as to an
outsider, but to the audience it appeared
to be first God, then the army, tnen your
married partner. The brigadier went
through the details very graciously, but
not with any kurry.
It would have been a great disappoint
ment to that big crowd had there been
anything lacking. Perhaps the brigadier
wanted to give all those present the full
valne for their money, or perhaps he de
rived some eatisfaction from prolonging
the agony, with a view to inuring the
bride and groom to hardships.
The ring did not slip on the bride's
wrong ringer by mistake, aa at most any
wedding, but the groom did imprint a
yery faint-sounding kiss on his young
wife's lips, and he aid it so unnaturally
that the audience roared.
Then the newly wedded couple were in- â 
vited to make little speeches. It was not
expected that they would be very original
at such a trying time, and they were not.
They assured their leaders that they
would be more energetic than ever in their
efforts to carry the message of salvation to
a dying world and then they were ex
cused.
At the close of the meeting it was an
nounced that Editor Milsaps had bsen re
appointed to the charge of the coast War
Cry nnd would be back at his post in about
a month. ____________

OAKLAND. Cal., July 16.â Councilman
Bassett and City Attorney Wilson have
agreed to take a boat ride down through
the Main Lake sewer.
At a meeting of the Finance Committee
last evening Superintendent of Streets
Miller recommended that the Main Lake
sewer be cleaned, when Bassett declared
that he would not vote any money for

was accepted. Arrangements will t>e

A FRATERNAL CENTER.

Alameda Scores a Point in the
War Over Harb:r Im
provements.
A Visit to Colonel Suter Does Not
Produce Very Satisfactory
Results.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,*
908 Broadway, July 16. j
President Taylor of the Oakland Board
of Trade made a discovery this morning.
In company with M. J. Keller and H. O.
Trowbridge he went to Colonel Suter, the
Government engineer, in regard to the
improvement of Oikland harbor.
While Oakland has been trying to exert
its. influence locally Alameda has been
working at Washington, and how far she
has been successful is now puzzling inter
eMcl parties in this city. Alameda, of
course, wants the tidal canal dredged out
first. Oakland wants the harbor finishing
first, and the war between the two cities
and the history of the petitions and
counter petitions has been fully chronicled
in The (all.
The most recent move on the part of
Alameda is to forward an application in
writing to General Craighill, head of the
Engineer Corps at Washington, advocat
ing the canal proposition. The Alame
dans got the signatures of all the Senators
and Congressmen in the State and sent
their petition six weeks ago.
Colonel Suter said he had received infor
mation from Washington in regard to the
document, but dul not satisfy his visitors i
as to the extent of its influence. He did I
not believe there would be any change in
the present method of conducting the
work.
Senator Perkins suid he had signed such
a paper under tue impression that it was
not proposed to stop work on the 1 arbor,
but that it was to be prosecuted in con
junction with the work on the canal.
There will be some keen hustlin; within
he nixt few days to rind out just how the
two cities stand in regard to the harbor.

GAVE TIME, COIN
AND SECURITY.
How the Trustees Became
Possessed of Lone Tree
Cemetery.
VETERANS IS ERROR.
President Dole Explains How
the Present Misunderstand
ing Came About
MIGHT MAKE SPECIAL SATES.
But as the Veterans Asked for a Gift
No Terms Con d Be
Made.
Oaklakd Offick San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 16. |
Edmund Dole, president of the board of
trustees of Lone Tree Cemetery at Hay
wards, says that the G. A. R. veterans do
not understand the true status of affairs
regarding the origin of the cemetery.
The application of the veterans for a
plat in the cemetery contained the follow
ing: .
â¢ â¢ * The organization desires to procure
a burial plat in your cemetery large enough
lor the membersâ present Â»nd futureâ
their families if you can see your way clear to
grant it. - '
: It should De understood In the beginning
that we are not able to buy a plat and are led
to present the matter for your consideration
by the knowledge that many cemetery associa
tions have donated such plats and the fact
that your association received several huh
dred dollars from the home military company
of Haywards when it disbanded.
Should you be willing to consider the propo
sition, the undersigned committee will be glad
to meet you at your convenience.' when a full
discussion and understanding may be had.
â¢.'â¢:.â¢ Awaiting your answer, we remain,
yours respectful. Committee.
In bis explanation President Dole says:
The Veterans' Association asks for a plat
large enough for the "members, present and
future, and their families." A member of the
association says there are eighteen or twenty
members find there may be twenty-five. For
this number, the smallest .lots would be the
least . required for : each member and family.
At the figure* 200 square feet, 10 feet by 20
feet (these are the smallest' lots except single
graves), the Veterans are asking for about
4000 square feet, not considering single graves
and decorating space, and, judging lrom their
ideas ex(>rrs^e), would at lensi calculation re
quire 8000 to 10,000 square feet.
The Veterans olaim the Hay wards Guard re
ceived money not theirs by right. The guard,
when it dissolved had $670, their wages for
service* ' rendered. It was first thought to
divide this money among the members, which
would have been their right. Others sug
gested the establishment of a library for the
town, and still others a cemetery. On a vote
it was unanimously decided to establish a cem
etery.''JsÃ9>Â®BTP*te*BÃHapÃP^BsajÃSSiJt^;
It was thought â  that each member of the
guard should have a small lot free, but when
the final decision was made it was resolved
that no lots should be donated to any of the
guards. â¢ .... â
The land cost $900; lumber (fencing, etc.),
$530; surveying and laying out lots, $403,
besides windmill, tank, trees,' tools and many
other items too numerous, to mention. The
fire trustees found it necessary to take money
from their private pockets, mid each one paid
$20 for a small lot, at the same price that they
are sold to any other citizen. . The trustees
gave their time to helo the surveyor.'and fur
nished stakes and sharpened | them, nor have
they ever received a cent's compensation lor
their services given the cemetery.
Money was borrowed at a high' rate of inter
est, and later at a lower rate, the Trustees giv
ing a joint note for the amount until . the sale
ot lots amounted to enough to pay the indebt
edness. The trustees want the Veterans' Asso
ciation to state where they obtained their in
formation ; regarding the sale of lots to mem
bers of the guard or any other person for $10.
This statement of the Veterans is false. No lot
was ever sold for less than $16. .
~A: member; of â  the .Veteran's Association
stated that contributions had been given by
citizens of Haywurds. This statement is ab
surdly false, as no one has ever contributed a
cent for any purpose whatever. â¢ . .- â¢â¢.
No lots or plat has ever been given away. If
the Veterans had asked to meet the trustees to
consider special rates, the trustees would have
been - willing to ir.et-t them, but their com
munication did not able this. *>*&Q&a3BSf t ft
The Veterans say they waited a long time for
a replyâ their communication was dated June
18, 1896â a special meeting of the trustees
was called and the reply sent June 23.

Marshal and Justice at War.
BERKELEY, Cal., July 16.â The Sal
mon battery case led to a war of words be
tween Justice James and Marshal L'oyn
which culminated in an angry courtroom
scene. Lloyd became dissatisfied with the
Judge's rulings during the cross-examina
tion of Mr. Salmon and expressed his dis
approval of the court's action in no very
formal language.
"I'll give you to understand that this
is my court and that I am trying this case,
Mr. Lloyd," said the Justice, startling the
courtroom with a loud bang of his fist on
the desk before him.
The Marshal responded with vigor and
for a few momenta the court rang with
the altercation, but when the Justice be
gan to hint at fines for contempt Mr.
Lloyd subsided and the case closed with a
dismissal of the defendant.

EQUALIZATION BUSINESS,
The State Board to Appear To-
Day and Make Some Ex
planations.
Legal Points Involved in the Matter
of tbe Adams Point Assess
ments.
Oakland Office Saw Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, July 16. j
Friday morning the State Board of
Equalization will appear before the Super
visors of the county and explain how it is
that they only assess ninety-six miles of
railroad track in this county when Asses
sor Dalton has found 200. The session
will, without doubt, be very interesting.
At this morning's session of the Board
of Equalisation the assessment of the
Adams Point property was brought up on
petition for reduction of Edson Adams
and Thomas Prather.
Mrs. H. J. Adams owns a half interest
and is assessed at $228,000, which she
asked to have reduced to $144,500. Mrs.
Julia Prather and Edson and John Adams
each have a one-sixth interest, assessed at
176.000, and each would like to have it re
duced to $48,100. The reduction is not
asked on the whole of the property, but
only on that portion north of the old
charter line.
The Assessor objected to a redaction on
legal grounds only. He claims proper de
mands were made on the owners for a full
statement of assessable property and the
same were not returned within the ten
days. Accordingly be made an arbitrary
assessment, which must stand. The fail
ure to return a statement was entered upon
the books, which made it final. The As
sessor's attorney, W. L. Hill, presented
the law covering the point to the board.
The petitioners' attorney swore Edson
and John Adams, who testified that a de
mand for a statement had never been
made upon them. Edson Adams made
one return, which was accepted.
Mr. Dalton read a sworn statement of
his deputy who made the assessment, but
wno could not attend the meeting owing
to his absence from the city. In it he set
forth that he had left a statement with a
member of every household in the dis
trict, which includes the property in ques
tion. Dalton insisted that this was a de
mand, and the opposition denied it.
Finally, Deputy District Attorney Church
was appealed to to interpret the law.
He asked the board to take the case under
advisement, as he was unable to decide
the question at the time, and this course
was pursued.
The application of Henry Rogers for a
reduction on the Merritt House assessment
turned on the same question and took the.
same course.
A. K. Grim, secretary of the Oakland
Consolidated Electric lines, filed a peti
tion for a reduction of their assessments.
It set forth in detail each item assessed,
amounting to $256,325. and asked tbat it be
reduced to $112,659, making a total reduc
tion of $143,666. The petition of the Ala
meda, Oakland and Piedmont Electric
line shows an assessment of $202,100,
which they ask to have reduced to
$107,313. Both of these represent
numerous franchises which Mr. Dal
ton has assessed and which the com
panies declare are worthlejs. In one case
there is no franchise ana in another it has
expired. The whole matter is a matter of
law which the board will leave to the Dis
trict Attorney to decide.

A REDUCTION OF
THIRTY PER CENT
Assessments South of the
Park Considerably
Lowered.
EQUALIZERS IN SESSION.
Scores of Property-Owners Want
Their Assessments Cut
Down.
MANY APPLICATIONS GRANTED
Owners of Real Estate Complain
That Their Land Has No
Market Value.
The Supervisors, sitting as a Board of
Equalization, met again yesterday after
noon and passed upon numerous applica
tions of comparatively small property
holders to have their assessments reduced.
Those who wished to have the assess
ments on their improvements lowered
told the familiar tale of being unable to
rem their houses, and real estate owners
complained that their lots had no market
value, as they could not got an offer of
any kind on them.
As a result of numerous protests from
property-owners south of the park, the
assessments in that neighborhood will be
generally reduced 30 per cent.
The following resolution, instructing the
Assessor to make the reductions, was
unanimously passed by the board at the
suggestion of Deputy Assessor Briggs:
Wheeeas, In accordance with the opinion of
the Assessor an error has been made in the as
sessment of property 6outh of the park, from
Fifteenth avenue to Eignteenth avenue, and
from M street to W street, therefore be it
Resolved, That the Assessor is hereby re
quired to make a uniform reduction in the as
sessed valuation of the property and return
the same to the board on his list of clerical
errors, and a report of the total reduction so
made in the assessment board.
Property-owners of every description ap
peared Defore the board yesterday praying
for reductions in their assessments. A
great many of the applications were
denied, quite a number of assessments
were reduced somewhat, and a few of the
reductions asked for were allowed in full.

THEY BiAME MIL SUTRQ
Coroner's Jury Returned a Sharp
Verdict Concerning Frank
Denvir's Death.
The Management of the Baths Cen
sured for Not Keeping the Tanks
Full of Water.
The management of Sutro baths was
strongly censured by a Coroner's jury
yesterday for the death of Frank Denvir,
who fractured hLs skull by falling into an
empty tan* while preparing to take a
plunge into one of the smaller reservoirs.
On July 8 young Denvir with several
companions visited the Cliff House resort
to enjoy a swim in the Mayor's expensive
â¢bathing establishment. While in the act
of climbing a ladder leading to one of the
chutes his foot slipped, causing him to
fall backward into the large tank. This
was empty, and Denvir struck on the
hard cement, receivine a fracture of the
skull, from the effects of which he died a
few hours later.
Ten witnesses were called to testify at
the inquest, and with but one or two ex
ception* they agreed that the ladder, as
well as the platform on which it rested,
was entirely unprotected so far as guide
ropes or railing went, and when the tanks
were empty the public was in constant
danger.
Professor Killick, the swimming in
structor at the bath?, said that due care
had been exercised to prevent accidents,
and testified that a rope had been
stretched across the platform from which
the boy fell. By the same witness, how
ever, it was shown that the rope extended
only from one side of the platform and as
a guard was entirely useless. Other wit
nesses testifying substantially to the same
facts were: Dr. Hunkeu, C. W. Freese,
Mrs. Rose Chapman and C. L. Hanke.
The latter was with Denvir at the time of
the accident. He said that he was going
up the ladder just in advance of the de
ceased, when bis foot slipped against Den
vir, knocking him from his position to
the cement flooring below.
The jury retired and after a few minutes
returned the following verdict:
And we further find Irona the evidence pre
sented that the deceased came to his death by
accident, caused by a fall in an empty tank,
and we, the jury, strongly censure the man
agement of Sutro's Baths for not having a
proper depth of water in the tank in which
the deceased met his death, aud we further
censure the management for not having a
proper depth of water in all tanks while the
baths are in public use.

THE BUILDING TRADES.
Union Workmen Anxious to Paint the
City Schoolhouses.
The subject of painting and whitening
the schoolhouses of this City was discussed
at the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last evening. It was reported that
at least twenty schoolhouses and rooms
are in need of painting and decorating
and the desire of the council is to have
the work done by union workmen.
In order to accomplish this a commit
tee, consisting of Messrs. o'Donnell,
Schuiz and O'Brien, was appointed to in
terview the Board of Education and Board
of Supervisors and endeavor to have the
contracts for the work let to only well
known union contractors.
Business Agent Connelly reported the
strike on the Smiley job on Fourteenth
and Valencia streets, in which about a
dozen carpenters and metal-roofers quit
work because a gang of non-union lathers
went there to work. Only one carpenter,
an Oakland union man named Aaron
Perry, refused to quit work with the others.
Yesterday when the workmen went to the
premises to see if the difficulty had been
settled they were called up and paid off.
This evidently means that the con
tractor does not intend to yield to the de
mands of the union, and that he does
mean to have the non-union lathers per
form the work.
If such be the case no union workmen
will, under the rules of the affiliated
unions, be permitted to to work on that
job even after the non-union lathers have
completed their work.
Wants Its Taxes Reduced.
The First National Bank sent a petition to |
the Board of Equalization yesterday asking I
that the valuation placed on its property by
the Assessor be reduced from $(577,355 to
$3000. The petition alleges that the institu
tion is a National bank, and that a United
States law provides that none of the personal i
property oi a National bank shall be assessed !
to the bank.

GRAND JURORS GO
DOWN THE LINE.
Reducing Municipal Esti
mates in Many De
partments.
LIGHTS AND SALARIES.
County Clerk Curry Replies to
the Letter From the
Jury.
DEFENDS HIS MANAGEMENT.
Redeemed the Office From Confusion
Wrought by His Prede
cessor.
The Grand Jury, at a special meeting
yesterday afternoon, discussed municipal
estimates in connection with the tax levy.
The estimates of the Auditor and the
requisition of each department were con
sidered. Many reductions were recom
mended.
The result of the jury deliberations in
this respect will be presented to the Board
of Supervisors at 10 o'clock to-morrow
forenoon. The expert, Horace D. Dunn,
is now engaged in the work of putting the
report in proper shape for the board's con
sideration.
The document will be presented to the
Superviaors by a committee of the jury
consisting of Frank Maskey (to reman),
Frank P. McLennan (secretary), Theodore
F. Payne, P. McG. McÃean, Alpheus Bull
Jr., J. J. O'Farrell ana E. E. Cbeever.
In regard to lighting the streets and
public buildings of San Francisco the
Grand Jury took the position that the
City as a single customer paying the light
company a quarter of a million dollars per
annum was entitled to a reduction. The
Supervisors will be asked to insist on a
reduction.
For Golden Gate Park the jury believes
that the sum of $200,000 is ample. It is
taken into notice thai the allowance of
$300,4M0 for the fiscal year ended June 30
last was extraordinary and without pre
oedent. This vast appropriation enabled
the Commissioners to complete important
improvements of a permanent character.
TnÂ« Grauu Jury therefore holds that
another appropriation ol equal magnitude
cannot be justified, but considering that
the park is a public resort and recreation
ground for all classes of citizens it decided
to recommend the liberal allowance of
$200,000.
The allowance for the Fire Department
as recommended by the Auditor was
deemed proper, and so no change in this
item of the budget was suggested.
The salaries of the Police Department
are fixed by law and no reduction in the
allowance can be made. The Grand Jury,
however, contends that the addition of
officers to the force be not authorized.
For use of the Board of Education in
maintaining the schools the Grand Jury
held that $1,000,000 suould be allowed.
This sum is $500,000 less than the Board of
Education called for.
Some weeks since Thomas R. Ashworth,
Superintendent of Streets, presented a
modnied requisition and the ri_ures then
submitted were accepted yesterday.
In the matter of charges for telephon
ing, the Grand Jury rinds that the sum id
the aggregate is startling and that surely
some reduction should be made. It is
difficult to ascertain exactly now much
the City pays, as the charges in this re
spect are frequently obscured or covered
in various accounts of other expenditure.
In a general way the Grand Jury finds
that clerical salaries are too high and out
of proportion to the compensation paid
for similar service by private corporations
and individuals. For example, clerks of
the Police Court get $200 a month.
It was suggested at the session of the
jury yesterday that a communication simi
lar to the one sent to County Clerk Curry
should be sent to the Recorder, Sheriff, City
and County Attorney, and other heads of
departments.
C. F. Curry, County Clerk, was ready to
go before the jury yesterday and explain
in detail the methods of his official man
agement, but the members of the jury be
ing engrossed in the work of revising
estimates could not hear him. He sent
to the Grand Jury the following reply to
the letter from that body :
San Fraxcisco, July 16, 1896.
To the Honorable the Grand Jury of the City
and County of San Francisco â Gentlemen: In
reply to your communication oi the 14th inst.
I would state that it is impossible to reduce
the expenses oi this office to the slim men
tioned by you, to wit, $7000 per month, and
have the business of the office properly con
ducted. Some of the experts wno appeared
before your body are my personal and political
enemies, oue oi whom was a County Clerk
several years Ago, at which time the business
of this office was much less tnan at present.
He found it necessary in trying to keep the
expenses of theoflicedown tos6uOO per month
to compel his deputies and clerks to accept a
less sum for their services than thtit allowed
by law. His attempt was unsuccessful, result
ing in many suits lor salaries against the City
and County, in all of which the plaintiffs re
covered judgment.

you was the gentleman whom I succeeded.
When he turned the office over to me the work
was behind^lJi every department. In the pro
bate department the work was six months be
hind. All of the work of the copying depart
ment with behind from the 2d of October,
1894. In the insolvency department the en
tries of final discharges, etc., were behind in
some cases a year. In the criminal depart
ment, in some of the principal cases, the
records were very defective, and it necessarily
devolved upon this olnce to rectify and com
plete that work. In addition to the work here
tofore performed by this department, by an
act of Congress passed March '23, 1890, the
pension agent can no longer attest vouchers,
thereby greatly increasing the work.
The work in the judgment department was
also some months behind in recording and
entry of judgments. Old records belonging to
this office had to be removed from the old City
Hall and from a storeroom in the basement of
this building, and had to be properly indexed,
classified and distributed, thereby entailing
extra work, which work is still in progress.
Under the new fee bill the work of this office
has been greatly increased. As an example of
the extra work performed during my adminis
tration I wouid stale that in the copying de
partment during my first fifteen months! did
more work than m\ predecessor did in his en
tire term.
One ol the most important duties connected
with the County Clerk's office, and which had
bet-n to a grpat extent neglecU-d by the former
administration, was the collateral inheritance
tax, Â«n act passed March 23, 1893. and which
requires the County Clerk to report every three
months on all estates on which he has roason to
believe a tax under this act is due and pay
able.
â¢ During'the two years of the former adminis
tration tnere was collected, according to the
reports furnished the Treasurer from this
office, less thai; $19,000. Under my adminis
tration there has been collected, according to
my reports furnished ;he Treasurer, over
$150,000, and there is due and payable over
9250,000.
I hnre also been obliged to revise all of the
reports furnished tiie Treasurer by my prede
cessor. During the past year the ordinary fees
collected through thi3 office amount to $82,
-713 50, the collateral inheritance tux amounts
to $74,321 31; total receipt* $157,034 81.
The total disbursements of the office, including
salaries, transcripts on appeal, stationery and
supplies, amounts to $134,165 50, showing a
balance of $22,209 31.
This is the first time in tho history of tho
County Clerk's office that a balance has been

turned into the treasury, making it a contrib
uting office, and not in any wise responsible
for the high tax levy of last year.
I consider that the business of the office and
the right* of litigants and attorneys require
the number of clerks now emoloyed by me.
Should the business of the office decrease I
will lessen my force of clerks accordingly.
Respectfully submitted.
C. F. Curry, County Clerk.
The foregoing letter did not change the
views of the Grand Jury. The members
adhered to the proposition that $7000 a
month was sufficient to run the office, and
therefore recommended that the Super
visors should allow that amount and no
more.
STABBED BY A GIRL.
Frank Johnson, a Colored Man, Beats
and Kicks Three Girls, and
One Retaliates.
Frank Johnson, a colored man, living at
1015 Mason street, was at the colored
people's picnic at Shell Mound Park yes
terday. He was accompanied by Florence
Mowe, white girl; Lulu Banks, a colored
girl, and two other girls, one known as
Margey, a white girl, and the other a col
ored girl.
Johnson was in a fightinp humor all
day, and late last night on the way home
with the girls from the ferry he began to
strike them. At Fifth aud Market streets
he knocked Margey down and kicked
her. Then he struck Florence, and Margey
got behind him and stabbed him in the
back and on the left cheek with a pen
knife.
This infuriated Johnson, and he was
kicking and striking Lulu Banks when
Policeman Crackbon, who was attracted
by the crowd, came upon the scene.
The three other girls had disappeared,
and Crackbon took Johnson to the Re
ceiving Hospital while Corporal Geimann,
who was also attracted by the crowd, took
charge of Lulu. Johnson's wounds, which
are not f erious, were attended to by Dr.
Thompson, and he was locked up in the
City Prison on a charge of battery pre
ferred by Lulu. The girl was detained
until Margey, the girl who did the stab
bing, can be iound.
Mrs. Hasklns' Deposition.
Mrs. Elizabeth Haskins spent nearly all day
yesterday in the notary's office listening to
the taking of her deposition preparatory to
signing it. Attorney K. B. Mitchell was pres
ent long eaough to ask that the notary attach
a certificate of his protest against the closing
of the deposition before the Judge of the Su
perior Court had passed upon the disputed
questiona.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JULY 17, 1896.
CLAUS SPRECKELS
IS HOME AGAIN,
About to Begin the Erec
tion of a Beet-Sugar
Refinery.
HAS BOUGHT PATENTS.
Will Consume 3000 Tons of
Beets Worth to Farmers
$12,000 per Day.
THAT SHARP - STICK STORY.
He Says That It Was Invented by
Some Enterprising Newspaper
Man.
Claus Spreckels is at home looking as
fresh and vigorous as a young man just
out of school. The man who inaugurated
the San Joaquin Valley road and who
i stands at the head of half a dozen other
I big enterprises in this State entered his
! office yesterday morning, drew his long-
I vacated chair up to his long-unopened
i desk and resumed the direction of his big
affairs as though there had been no inter
ruption whatever.
But there were very many interruptions
after that. Friends learned that Mr.
j Spreckels had come to town on the flier
; the nieht before, and there was a con
stant procession of them in and out of the
back offices shaking hands and congratu
i lating him upon his safe return and the
| happy effects of the journey so apparent
! in his sprightly appearance.
Mr. Bpreckels returns full of hopeful an-
I ticipation and big enterprises for the
future. He remained in his office all the
morning rapidly acquainting himself with i
I the status of his affairs. At noon he took I
lunch with some friends at his club, and
returning remained at his office till to
wnrri sundown.
When seen for a few moments during
I tl;e run of callers in the afternoon, Mr. i
Spreckels found time to say:
"Yes, lam back at work again. I have
bad not only a very pleasant outine, but
it has not been without its profitable side.
i You may say that my trip has determined
j me in my purpose of building a beet-sugar
iactory. I shall begin the construction at
once and hy this time next year i expect it
to be in full operation, employing 500 to i
I 600 men directly in the refinery" and giving I
I an impetus to the growing of sugar beets j
j all over the State. It will be a big thing !
for the farmers, giving them a ready mar- j
ket for a profitable product. My plans i
contemplate a refinery that will consume
no less than 3000 tons of beets per day. \
At $4 a ton this contemplates the distribu
tion among the farmers of the State of the
neat round sum of $12,000 a day.
"The iourney was taken almost solely j
with the purpose of studying the beet sujrar '
industry at its best development at its !
home in Europe," continued Mr. 6preck- j
els. "I visited many of the biggest and I
most modern refineries in the world where
they are to be found in France. Germany
and Austria. I became convinced that it
is the thing for California. I have pur
chased a number of patents on the beet i
processes atid am ready to get into the
manufacture on a large scale.
"Indeed," continued Mr. Spreciols,
"there is no reason why California should
not manufacture the sugar for this big
Nation ol ours. If the people will only
stir themselves, this State would take its
place in the front rank of all the States,
where her resources entitle her to be.
Some day it will do that, I am sure â even
though I may not live to see it. For the
present I would like to see the peopJe
move in the enterprises I have mentioned,
and not lag behind, leaving me to carry
the load alone. If the moneyed men of the
State would invest it in enterprises giving
employment to the people and making a
reasonable return, they could help
amazingly toward the good work of dis
pelling the so-called hard times. That
indeed is all that is required to put hard
times to a sudden rout. '
Mr. Spreckels said he could not say just
where the factory would be located. A
number of practical questions entered into
the main question of the iocation and
these could not be answered off-hand.
Being asked what he had to say about
the Valley road, Mr. Spreckels answered:
"Only that it seems to be moving along
finely. I have only returned to the City
a few hours. 1 have had much to attend
to, but from what I have seen and heard
concerning the road I am much gratified.
It seems to be progressing quite as well as
could be expected. Oh, we will have s
railroad doing business down the valley
pretty soon. There is no reason to ques
tion that."
"And about that sharp stick which you
are going after Steve White with?"
Mr. bpreckels laughed. "Oh. I am really
not responsible for that story," he said.
"\es, I understand that some such tale
was sent out here, but I can't be respon
sible for any language an Eastern news
paper man chooses to put in my mouth.
\\ ith regard to politics I have only to say
that I have confidence in the people of the
United States. We have had an experi
ence. It is a great teacher. The majority
of the voters of the Nation a^e not tools.
McKinley will be elected."
A BETTER FRUIT MARKET.
J. H. Flickinger Return* From the East
aud Reports Good Progpec a.
J. H. Flickinger of San Jose, who is ex
tensively interested in the fruit business,
returned last night from the East, where
he has 3pent three months in studying the
condition of the fruit markets.
He says that generally speaking the old
stock of dried and canned fruits has been
pretty well used up. The resuit is that
there will be a lively demand for this
year's crop, which he asserts will be much
smaller than that of last year. He thinks
that California fruit will rind a ready and
favorable market awaiting it in the East,
particularly since the damage to the fruit
crop in the Northwest.
"I traveled round all through the East,"
said he last nig.it at the Palace, "and
everywhere I found a strong sentiment in
favor of McKinley. Not until I got back
here to San Francisco to-day did I find a
Democrat who reaily had sand enoueh to
declare boldly that he thought the Demo
crats could win this year. He said, 'I
| know Bryan '11 be elected and I'd like to
place money on it.' I told him that I
would very willingly accommodate him
immediately, and then he said, 'Wait un
tl.l.the Populist convention is over.' I re
pned that I would continue to be willing
and for any amount that he might wish to
place, and I gave him my card."

COHEN PROVED
FALSE TO FRIENDS
The Weil-Known Collector
Disappears Very Sud
denly
WITH HIS CLIENTS' CASH
Many Patrons of the Agency
Now Wonder How They
Were Duped.
HIS WAYS OF TURNING MONEY.
Once a Member of the Legislature,
Richard Cohen Is Now Hiding
From Detectives.
Another collector has strangely disap
peared, and, as usual, with his clients'
money, from the business community of
San Francisco. In this particular instance
the man who gathered in other people's
money for pay gave himself up to a labor of
love fora lone time immediately prior to
his departure for virgin fields. He simply
surpassed himself in industry, so far as
collecting money and manipulating prop
erty went, but he quite overlooked the in
cidental matter of making an accounting
to whom he was responsible, and so ended
his career in this City.
This collector, who was so unkind as to
thus slight his patrons and friends, is Ricn
ard Cohen, who was once a promising and
prominent young man, with friends and
influence to back him. So he gradually
worked up a lucrative business, and ban
died large suras of money.
Of late he occupied rooms 3 and 10 in
the Murphy building at Market and Jones
streets, and it is said his business war
ranted him in maintaining two large of
fices. Those who had dealings with him
were given no cause to complain of his
methods, much less to entertain mistrust
or suspicion of him. His offices had all
the appearance of those used by a pros
perous well-to-do man; they were nicely
furnished, had a fine safe, shelves of books
and similar evidences of comfort combined
with stability. As for Cohen himself peo
ple looked upon him as a fixture in the
place.
But they little thought that Cohen was
spending his nights in convivial pleasures,
and altogether too frequently indulged in
intoxicating liquor.
Not once did it cross the minds of
Cohen's patrons that the trusted collector
would do such a thing as gather their
coin and immediately proceed to scatter it
with bibulous companions. So he had
their confidence.
About eight or ten days ago their dream
of security was rudely shocked when
Cohen failed to appear as usual at his
office. At first his clients tried to con
vince themselves that he had gone into
the country for a short vacation, but as
days passed without the least sign of him
they grew suspicious, and each one made
an investigation for himself. This was
after a sign, "to let," appeared upon the
door of the office of Richard Cohen, col
lector, and the furniture and httings bad
been carted away.
In the last few days several instances of
Cohen's transactions hay* come to light.
Those who are directly interested look for
many more developments of a similar na
ture, but none of the duped clients can
even conjecture what number of people
are sadly disappointed over the sudden
disappearance of Cohen.
He collected for Ewell's dairy, and is
said to have taken at least $300 of collected
milk bills, so that the dairy is now mak
ing a canvass of its customers to learn
where it stands.
Krug <fc Co., the Mission malthousemen,
held a judgment against somebody for
about $100, which they gave to Cohen for
collection. The story goes that Cohen
sold the judgment for $30 and retained the
money. Attorney King, in the Chronicle
building, was interested in a case in in
solvency, and is now eager to find the
missing collector in connection with the
case.
When the newspaper syndicate was sell
ing its encyclopedia here Cohen purchased
a set. He paid an installment of $1 and
sold the books. The syndicate has a de
lective at work seeking to tind the where
abouts of tha collector who resorted to
the old game of selling property bought
on tho rental plan.
Last January Cohen bought a handsome
sate from the Hall Safe Company, leasing
it with the provision that he could buy it
on installments, the first of which would
be due in April. He never paid a dollar
on the safe, but sold it alone with his
furniture to a young business man who
had known him intimately for years.
He explained that times were dull with
him and he was forced to give up his office
and seek other employment. Almost on
the same day Cohen disposed of the furni
ture and books to two different parties and
got the money from both.
It was then that a case of first come
first served, for the second and third man
found nothing when they went to Cohen's
office prepared to move the things. The
safe company took a hand and claimed
the mucn-sold safe. Of course under the
circumstances it was folly to attempt to
hold possession of the property, which
was accordingly relinquished by ail pur
chasers. The men who were caught in
this deal are most bitter in their com
plaints against Cohen. These are only a
few of the cases so far known in connec
tion with Cohen's grand rinale, but it is
said there are several more of a like char
acter.
It was discovered yesterday by those
who are hunting for the abscondei that
his letters have been inclosed in large en
velopes addressed to "Otto Eikelmann,
Virginia City, Nev.," and from this it was
believed that Eikelmann was aware of
Cohen's whereabouts. The letters have
been sent by Cohen's friends from here.
Eight or ten years ago Cohen was very
popular about townâ a bright, intelligent
young fellow, with friends on every hand.
He was then elected a member of the State
Legislature by a large majority.
Since then he was collector for the Col
lier Book Company, but get into difficuW
ties with that firm, horn which he was
saved by the timely aid of relatives. His
father, now dead, was at one time a
wrulthy and prominent man in Ban Fran
oi.-co. and from him Cohen inherited the
intluence he had among a large circle of
business men.
One of Cohen's acquaintances remarked
yesterday, when giving the reason for his
downward run: "His ruin was attributa
ble to drink."
