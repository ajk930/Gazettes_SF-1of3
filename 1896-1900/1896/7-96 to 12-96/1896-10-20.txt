Crowd at the Canton
Tabernacle.

Continue to Arrive at the
McKinley Home.
TELLING WOKDS OF PATRIOTISM
Always, Says the Next President.
Has the Republican Party Fought
Against Repudiation.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 19.â The booming
of cannon at 7 o'clock this morning an
nounced the opening of *he meeting at
the Tabernacle of the Union generals, un
der the leadership of General R. A. Alger.
In spite of the early hour for which the
meeting was called the hall was tilled
with an enthusiastic audience. The mem
bers of the party were presented by R. A.
Cassidy of this city. Short speeches were
made by Generals Howard, Alger, Mar
den, Stewart and Sickels, and Corporal
Tanner. As each speaker concluded his
reniarKs ne was presented with a basket of
etioice flowers by the members of the
Woman's Relief Corps of Canton.
After the meeting the visitors were es
corted to the depot by a large number of
citizens. Major McKinley drove down to
the depot from his residence to see the
generals off.
A delegation of business men from
Zwickley, Fa., arrived here at 11:30 o'clock
and called on Major McKinley at his resi
dence. The speaker for the McKinley and
Hobart Sound-money Club of Zwickley
was George Wallace. He reviewed with
graphic felicity the effects oi the "Wilson
tariff law upon the industrial and com
mercial world, find said that the growing
belief in the election of Major AJcKinley
was beginning to restore confidence.
Major McKinley made a short speech in
reply, which was received with applause
and much cheering. Major McKinley
said in part:
lam glad to have tne assurances of your
spokesman that in this crisis of our history
you are standing for National honor and for
the preservation of our free institutions. Tt i
Republican party has always occupied a pf/t
of preat honor. From the time of its organiza
tion down to the preyentmoment It has been
the leader oi ail that is best in government.
It was born in the interest of liberty and the
rights of humanity. It has riever struck a
blow that has not been for freedom ana our
glorious flag. And in every great emergency
that party, not so old as some other parties in
this country, has led for the right, for justice,
for good morals and for public honesty. It
never had a higher post of honor than it has
to-day. Glorious as the past has been it never
carried a flag which' involved more to the in-
Btitutionsof our country and its good name
than the liig which it carries to-day, and I am
glad to know that from one end of this coun
try to the other the intelligence and judgment
and conscience of the American people are not
appealed to in vain. Some people seem to
have the notion that the Republican party
has made a new departure; that it occupies a
different position to-day from that which, it
ever occupied in the past. That is a mistake.
We stand where we have always stood, not
only upon the money question, but on the
tariff question ; and 1 want to call your atten
tion to what may have escaped you. When
the war closed the great problem before the
American people after the reconstruction of
the Union was what should be done with the
great debt that had been occasioned by the
war and what should be done by way of main
taining a sound currency in the United States.
In 1868 the great soldier of the war, who had
led the mightiest armies tnat were ever en
gaged in sustaining a cause, General Grant,
was nominated for President. Let me read
you two planks of the piatform upon which
he stood, and you can see then whether the
Republican party hae changed its position:
'â We denounce all forms of repudiation as a
National crime, and the National honor re
quires payment of public debts in the utmost
good faith to all creditors at home aud abroad,
not oaly according to the letter but the spirit
of the law under which it was contracted."
That was when we had that enormous war
debt of over $2,000,000,000, and the country
seemed to be staggering under it, but the Re
publican party stood up as it always has and
insisted that every dollar of that debt must be
paid in the best currency of the world, and
under that policy we have paid off more than
two-thirds of that great National debt and
paid every dollar of it with honor and in the
best currency.
Another party of political pilgrims, also
accompanied by a large number of ladies,
journeyed up the hill to Major McKinley's
Market-street home about 2 p. m. They
came from Mogadore, Ohio, and brought
the candidate assurances of loyalty and
earnestness in support of the tk:Ket from
the Republicans of that section. The
visitors were introduced to Major McKin
ley by State Representative F. Myers. In
responding Major McKinley spoke in a
neighborly way to his former constitu
ents, and bade them remember that the
Nation's superb record of progress in the
Jast thirty 3 T ears was made under a policy,
first of a protects e tariff, and second
under a sound monetary system. He
urged his visitors to vote for good money
and protection to home industries.
The mail and telegraph are still bring
ing requests from leaders of delegations
asking Mr. McKinley if he can receive
them.
MARION TO FOLLOW BRYAN.
Speeches' to Counteract Ant/ Influence
the Aebraskan Mat/ Have.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 19.âEx-Congress
man William E. Marion, who has been
making speeches for McKinley in Illinois
and who met W. J. Bryan in joint debate
two weeks before the Chicago convention,
â¢was engaged today by the Illinois Re
publican committee to follow Mr. Bryan
and make speeches in the vicinity of the
halls where Mr. Bryan holds forth.
This kind of campaigning on the eve of
the election promises to make a lively
week in Chicago and may lead to a physical
clash between the pol itical forces. Commit
teeman Kerens of Missouri came to Ke
publican headquarters to-day and said the
situation had improved for McKinley.
Folia bad beta taken in the northern parts
The San Francisco Call

total of 15,000 gold Democrats will vote
against Bryan. Mr. Kerenssaid there was
much confusion regarding fusion of the
Democrats and Populists.
There were other visitors from Missouri
looking for speakers to wind up the cam
paign. By direction of the National Com
mittee Chief Hahn will send numer
ous orators of the best ability into Mis
souri this week ana next the efforts of the
committee will be turned toward Missouri,
as a State which promises much for Mc-
Kinley.
J. B. Hughes of Hamilton, Ohio, who
was Consul to Birmingham daring Cleve
land's first term, returned to-day from the
Pacific Coast States. He said California
and Oregon were sure to go Republican.
General John B. Henderson will make a
flying trip through Missouri with a large
party as the guest of National Committee-*
man Kerens.
"UNSOUND AND DANGEROUS"
Why Assistant HecretarfÃMeAdoo De
â  nounces the Chicago Platform. â !,..-
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 19.â 1n a letter
to W. J. Curtis, a member of the National
Democratic Committee of New Jersey,
Assistant Secretary of the Navy McAdoo
says that he is opposed to the platform
and unable to support the ticket nomi
nated at Chicago, because he "is thor
oughly convinced that the doctrines
therein sec forth are unsound and dan
gerous and would work incalculable in
jury to the whole people of the republic,
being, from a political and economical
point of view, extremely radical, if not
revolutionary, fierce with the heat of re
newed sectionalism and savage with the
bitterness of class distinctions hitherto
unknown to this country.
"I yield to no one," he says, "in my be
lief in the majority and independence of
this great country; its imperial place
among the power of the nations; its duty
to assert its rights and maintain its honor
in all lands and on all seas; but I cannot
be convinced that the best way to make it
omnipotent against the world, if not as
proposed against nature itself, is to weaken
its prestige and clip its authority at home,
discredit its institutions and impair its
business integrity. In such a contest as
this party associations, personal friend
ships and interests and even family ties
cannot be allowed to interpose between us
and our primary duty to stand by the re
public, the best help of humanity, to keep
unimpaired, sacred and honored its insti
tutions and its flag."
MORE T HAN A QUORUM THERE.
Speaker Heed Talks to a Biff Crowd at
the Chicago Auditorium.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 19.â Hon. T. B.
Reed to-day addressed an audience that
tilled the Auditorium from bottom to top.
Outside the theater was a great crowd
clamoring for admission. After a medley
of patriotic airs played on the immense
organ and several selections by a glee club
Mr. Reed arrived and was greeted by loud
applause and cheera several times repeated,
one enthusiast shouting, "Do you think
there's a quorum present?" which was
greeted with general laugater.
Mr. Keed was introduced by George R.
Peck and made a characteristic speech,
which was frequently interrupted by en
thusiastic applause, while his sallies of wit
received equally hearty laughter.
This evening Mr. Reed addressed an
audience of 8000 people in a big tent at
Fifty-first and Morgan streets. He was
quite hoarse, and spoke only for about
three minutes.
Hill Get the Return*.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 19.âArrange
ments have Deen completed at Republican

will be a larjie corps of clerks and tele
graph operators at worJi receiving and
tabulating the returns. A long-distance

Union General* Speak.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Oct. 19.âThetonr
ine generals arrived here to-night, their
appearance ending a big political demon
stration held during the afternoon. The
principal meeting of the night was held at
the Central Armory. All the speakers
made short addresses, but the crowd was
rather disappointing. General Sickels
was the principal speaker at the second
meeting, held in a downtown hall.
FOLLOWED BY A MASSACRE
Turks Renew Their Atrocities
After the Disorders oc
cur in Van.
English Protest Against These Slaugh
ters and New J?rseyites Denounce
the Policy of Inaction
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 19.â The Daily
News will to-morrow publish a dispatch
saying that advices received there show
that disorders occurred in Vanon Septem
ber 23, followed by a terrible massacre in
October. No details are given.
A dispatch from Rome to the Daily
News says that the Pope,'in response to
an appeal from Mgr. Azarian, Catholic
patriarch of Armenia, has sent a large
snm of money for the relief of the dis
tressed Armenians.
A meeting called for the purpose of pro
testing against the Turkish atrocities was
held in St. James Hall, London, this
evening, under the chairmanship of the
Rie:ht Bey. Edward Stuart Talbot, D.D.,
Bishop of Rochester.
The hall was crowded to its fullest ca
pacity. A letter from Mr. Gladstone was
read, in which the ex-Prime Minister de
clared that it would be a wild paradox to
say that the enforcement of the British
treaty rights to stop the systematic ma3
macres in Turkey would provoke hostili
ties from the powers. He added that it
would be abandoning duty and prudence
to advertise beforehand for the ears of the
great assassin that British action was
limited to what the most backward of the
powers deemed sufficient. If the funda
mental distrust of Great Britain and the
belief that she is pursuing a selfish policy
in the eastern Mediterranean caused some
powers to be backward, that was a matter
which deserved to be bravely considered.

[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.]
this city, resulting in the forwarding of a
telegram to President Cleveland, urging
him to insist upon the placing of a guard
ship at Constantinople and an indemnity
of $100,000 for ontra<:es committed on
American citizens in Turkey. There were
nearly 2000 people at the meeting. The
meeting denounced the administration
and Minister Terrell for their aliened lack
of backbone in handling the Armenian
question.
WASHINGTON, D. C., Oct. 19.-Ad
mirai Selfridge cabled the Navy Depart
ment to-day that the Marbiehead left
Smyrna to-day for Gibraltar on lier way
home. The message contained no refer
ence to the other ships of his command.
The San Francisco and Bancroft are still
with the flagship Minneapolis, and it is
thought that had their mission been any
thing but peaceful he would not have de
tached the Marbiehead at this time.
DUG OUT BY HIS DOG.
Henry Miller's Life Saved by the Intelti-
gence and Perseverance of a
Sagacious Canine.
CHICAGO, 111., October 19.â Henry
Miller of this city came very near losing
his life near Greggs, 111., yesterday, and it
was only owing to the sagacity of his dog
that he escaped a fearful death. Miller
went out early yesterday in search of nuts,
taking his dog with him. When he
alighted from the train he proceeded
to a walnut grove two miles south of
Greggs.
After filling his sack he espied a wood
chuck on a neighboring siuehili. He
shot at it and ran it into its hole. Leav
ing his dog on euard, he went to tbe
house of Jacob Meyer, a mile distant,
and borrowed a shovel with which
to dig the animal from its burrow. Miller
soon dug a d-ep pit in the side of the hill,
when suddenly a portion of the overhang
ing bank gave way and buried him under
half a ton of gravel.
Fortunately his face was not covered
and he was able to breathe, but ho was so
weighted down it was impossible to move
a muscle. He shouted for aid until he
was hoarse, and was about to giva up in
despair when he thought of his dog. Call
ing the faithful beast he bade him dig.
The dog seemed to comprenend, and
scratched gravel so zealously that at the
end of half an hour Miller was able to
move one arm, and soon succeeded in es
caping from his perilous position. He
was so thoroughly frightened he took the
tirst train back to the City. Before leav
ing he refused an offer of $50 for the dog.
Schoolcrafl Wants the Bonds.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 19.â A claim
ant for the $60,000 bonds recently discov
ered in a:: abandoned trunk appeared this
morning giving the name of John Law
rence Schoolcraft. He told the Chief of
Police that the bonds were stolen from
him in 1893, and that he haa read of their
recovery in the newspapers. He gave the
number of the bonds. The case was post
poned and another interview was arranged
for to-morrow.
Disciples of Christ.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Oct. 19.â T0-day's
session of the international convention of
the Disciples of Christ was devoted to an

WHO SUCCEEDS
BISHOP KEANE?
Interest Centered on the
Catholic University
of America.
Three Names of Prelates to Be
Submitted to Pope Leo
at Rome.
ONE OF THESE TO BE SELECTED
With the Meeting of the Directors of
the Institution There Will Be an
Assemblage of Archbishops.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 19.-The
Catholic University of America 'will be
the center of interest to American Roman
Catholics next Wednesday when the
board of trustees will meet to select the
names of three clergymen from which the
Pope of Rome will choose a successor to
Bishop Keane.
Ever since the sensational announce
ment of Bishop Keane's resignation the
interest has been intense, and laymen and
churchmen alike have been speculating
upon what the final result of the contro
versy will be. Progress toward this result
will be made at tho meeting Wednesday,
but even the most sanguine do not believe
that the action of the trustees will be in
the nature of a final settlement of the dif
ferences now so palpably in evidence
among. high members of the American
hierarchy over the policy indicated in the
late rector's removal.
The meeting will convene at 10:30
Wednesday morning in tbe Senate cham
ber of McMahon Hall. The first business,
it is expected, will be the selection of can
didates for the vacant rectorship. Several
names have beed mentioned as probaDili
ties. Among them are those of Bishop I.
Spalding of Peoria, Horstmann of Cleve
land, Rev. Peter C. Yorke of San Fran
cisco, Archbishop Chapelle, Very Rev.
Augustin F. Hewitt of New York City,
Rev. Dr. Bram of New York City and Rev.
Dr. Pace, dean of the school of philosophy
at the university.
The name of Rev. Father Conaiy, head
of the Catholic Summer School of Philoso
phy at Piattsburfr, N. V., is also promi
nently mentioned for the place, and the
belief prevails in well-informed circles that
his will be one of the names submitted to
the Pope. Father Conaiy is attached to
the Springfield (Mass.) diocese. The
friends of Dr. Garrigan, vice-rector of the
university, are expecting that his name
will be included in those sent to the Pope.
They say he has given seven years of hard
work to the university, leaving one of the
best parishes in New England to taKe the
vice-rectorship. It is urged that he should
be considered before priests from outside,
who have no special knowledge of tbe uni
versity, are brought here.
Dr. Edward P. Allen, head of the Mount
St. Mary's Seminary, Emmitsburg, Md.,
is mentioned, as be is the head of the
only large college conducted by the senior
branch of the Catholic clergy. The heads
of the large colleges controlled by the
orders, including Fordham, Georgetown
and Notre Dame, are considered ineligible,
as the university is distinctly a secular
institution.
It is said that none of the Bishops men
tioned would be iikely to take the place i
appointed, because if the Pope's pro
nounced wishes in favor of the relatior.
of the rectorship is followed a Bishop wh(
took it would find himself in a few yean
out of office and with no diocese.
Bishop Spalding, who is in Europe, will
not attend the meeting. On Thursday
there will be a meeting of the thirteen
Archbishops in the United States at the
Catholic university, they having changed
their place of meeting from New Orleans
to this city. The Archbishops have noth
ing to do with the affairs of the institu
tion in an official capacity as a body, but
their presence here, it is thought, may
have a bearing upon the deliberations of
the trustees by reason of the strong per
sonal influences they exert.
Failure of a Farmer's Sank.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Oct. 19.â A special from
Marion, Oiiio, to the Bee says that tbe
Marion Deposit Bank closed its doors this
morning on account of inability to meet

Killed by a Fa I Una Roof.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Oct. 19.â
The roof of a new building of , the Univer
sity of Virginia fell to-day burying five
workmen. Two were killed and three
very badly hurt. The building was being
erected to replace the building destroyed
by fire nearly a year ago. It was one story
high and had a concrete roof. It was in
tended for a lecture-room. A fatal mis
calculation was made as to the weight of
the roof and the strength of the supports.
When the accident took place the five
men were buried under a mass of con

Hon. C. A. Boutelle, the distinguished
member of Congress from Maine, will ad
dress the people this evening in Wood
ward's Garden Pavilion on Valencia street.
Congressman Boutelle has made a bril
liant record during his seven terms in
Congress, and his constituency has just
re-elected him for the eighth time. He
has taken a leading part in the National
councils and has been the most prominent
in the upbuilding of the American navy.
Congressman Boutelie arrived in this
City yesterday morning from Los Angeles
and took rooms at the Palace Hotel. He
is accompanied by his daughter, MUs
Grace H. Boutelle, an accomplished and
charming young woman. Mrs. H. G.
Lorinjc of this City is an aunt of the Con
gressman, and Miss Anna Bontel.'e is his
sister. William Boutelle of the Oakland
street railway system is a brother, and he
and Mrs. Loring and Miss Anna Boutelle
spent the afternoon with him yesterday.
An immense crowd is expected in the
pavilion to-night to hear him. He is al
most as well known and popular here as
he is at home, and is noted as a, graceful
and vigorous speaker and a sound
logician. Republicans, Democrats and
Populists who have not been out much to
political meetings will be amply repaid
should they attend this one, for Mr.
Boutelle will be received by the masses of
the people, and the meeting promises to
be one of the greatest and the most im
portant held this year. This will be the
oaly occasion on which the people of San
Francisco will have an opportunity of
hearing him speak, because he will leave
for Sacramento to-morrow on his way
East
One of the most remarkable facts con
nected with his political career is that, al
though nominated for Congress nine
times, he has never had a vote cast against
him either in caucus or convention.
"This whole story," said the Congress
man to a Call reporter yesterday, "in the
matter of the reportea success ot Bryan's
campaign is made up by the newspapers.
When Mr. Bryan came down to Maine
after the election he spoke in the city in
which Mr. Sewall resides, and in a county
that had given phenomenal Republican
majoritiesâ treble and quadruple the num
ber of votes that had been cast before â
and considerable people went to see and
hear him, most of them from curiosity.
The Associated Press has engaged Mr.
Bryan's private secretary to report all the
Bryan meetings, and those reports have
been so one-sided that Editor Rosewater
of the Omaha Bee recently made a strong
protest against it.
"Mr. Sewall said that the Bryan meet
ing was the largest ever held in Maine,
but the fact is that it was not one-third
the size of meetings held in years gone by,
when Mr. Blame and other distinguished
men spoke."
Since Mr. Boutelle first became a mem
ber of Congress his principal work was on
the Naval Committee, the matters han
dled by that committee being familiar to
him because his early life was passed in
the merchant marine service. About the
beginning of the war he returned from a
foreign voyage for the purpose of joining
the United States navy, in which branch
of the War Department he served as a
volunteer officer during the whole of the
Civil War. In 1864 he was promoted for
gallant conduct in an engagement in
North Carolina Sounds with' the rebel
ironclad Albemarle. At that time he was
the navigating officer of the Sassachu, a
light-draught sidewheel wooden gunboat,
and finding that her shots tailed to do
any damage to the Albemarle, he ran
the Sassachu into her at full speed in
the attempt to sink her. The Sassachu
came very near sinking her, but did not
quite succeed.
She disabled the rebel craft, however,
by tearing the muzzle off one of her guns,
but a shot from the Albemarle went
through her boilers, exploding them and
killing and wounding several men.
His lasÂ£ service was with the Gulf squad
ron, when he took part in the capture of
Mobile, in command of a small vessel
called the Nyanza, which went up the
Tombigbee River and received the surren
der of the rebel fleet.
At the close of the war he resigned from
the service and went north, where he com
manded passenger vessels on the Atlantic
coast, and shortly afterward he went into
the shipping and commission business in
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
New York City. In 1870, at the recom
mendation of his friend James G. Blame
that he should go into journalism, he went
to Bangor, Me., and assumed the editor
ship of the SBanxor Daily and Weekly
Courier, which was at that time a leading
Republican paper.
I.'i 1874, on the death of the proprietor,
he purchased the paper with Mr. Brewer,
and has conducted the paper ever since.
When he was elected to Congress in 1882
he naturally became a member of the
Naval Committee, and during his mem
bership on that committee the entire
work of building np the new navy of the
United States was accomplished. This
feat has been regarded as the most mar
velous illustration of the boundles? re
sources and capacities of this country.
When he first entered Congress there had
been one appropriation made for the first
new steel ships, known as the Roach
shipsâ the Chicago, Boston, Atlantic and
Dolphin â and the contracts had just been
awarded. That was in the Forty-seventh
Congress. In the Forty-ninth Congress
he was one of the Naval Committee, when
the building of the second batch of vessels
was authorized, which included the
Charleston and the Baltimore.
At that time this country was depend
ent for all the heavy steel forgings for the
guns and the armor for the uncompleted
monitors, for the hollow steel shafting and
for the engines, upon foreign forges, as
also for a considerable portion of the steel
plating. There were no great steel forges
in this country.
In 1886. after Mr. Cleveland had become
President, Mr. Whitney, his Secretary of
the Navy, had undertaken to go forward
with the building of new war vessel?, nnd
the first bill framed in the winter of 1885-86
provided for the construction of some
plans that had been purchased in England
by Mr. Whitney. Those for the Charles
ton were the plans of the Japanese cruiser
Naniwa Kan, and the plans for the ship
that became the Baltimore and her sister
ship the Philadelphia were from designs
made by the former constructor for the
British navy.
On this subject Congressman Boutelle
said: "The bills contained a provision for
the purchase of engines to be manufac
tured in England, on the ground that
none of these high-power marine engines
had ever been built in this country, and
that it would be practically impossible to
produce them here in time. I very stren
uously opposed that provision, and was
assisted in my opposition by other loyal
members of the committee, and finally
Secretary Whitney recommended that
that provision be dropped out, he stating
that while the machinists of this country
had had no practice in that line for many
years, he was inclined to trust to their
skill to produce whatever we needed.
The outcome was that the engines built
by the contractors here at home produced
better results than had been called for by
the English specification?.
"While that legislation was in progress
I moved to amend the provision which re
quired the Secretary of the Navy to con
struct these vessels of materials of domes
tic manufacture, including the armor and
other steel forpings, if they could be ob
tained in the United States within a rea
sonable time and at a reasonable price. I
moved to strike out the conditions and
make it obligatory upon the Secretary of
the Navy to procure all these materials of
domestic manufacture, basing my de
mand upon the ground that it was abso
lutely essential that we should be able to
produce in this country all the important
material entering into the construction of
our ships of war.
"It was urged that we had not thÂ« plants
WEW TO-DAT.
A PERFECT BREAKFAST FOOD.2
with which to produce them, which was
true, and many eentlemen argued that it
would take an indefinite period, and at
best would be but problematical as to
whether we could succeed within a reason
able time in setting up in tnis country the
ponderous machinery requisite for pro
ducing this material. I took the ground
that the only way in which it would ever
be produced would be by the Government
Insisting from the beginning that we
should establish in this country the facili
ties for producing the material with which
to build our ships, without regard to the
fact that at the out=et it might cost us
vastly more than it would to purchase the
material abroad.
"I carried that proposition into the
committee of the whole, but was defeated.
The controversy was carried forward, how
ever, and the result was that the amend
ment was formally and finally enacted by
Congress authorizing the Secretary of War
and tbe Secretary of tbe Navy to advertise
for proposals for the proiuction of $10,
--000,000 worth of heavy steel iorgings for
guns and armor, and that we would enter
into contracts witn any parties who would
furnish a suitable guarantee that within a
certain time they would establish, within
the jurisdiction of the United States, with
private capital, a plant with the machin
ery requisite for producing the heaviest
forcings required by our navy.
"That was in 1886, at a time when not a
ton of this heavy plate could be produced
in the United States. The upshot of this
encouragement was that within a few
years we had established at Bethlehem,
Pennsylvania, a great plant fitted with
machinery much more powerful than any
in Europe, and subsequently were estab
lished the Carnegie works and other great
steel plants, so that for years past and
now every naval appropriation bill has
contained the unqualified requirement
that the vessels in every part shall Decon
structed of materials of domestic manu
facture. I feel more pride because of that
fact than anything else I have done.
"When I was chairman of the Naval
Committee in the Fifty-first Congress, and
â we had built some of the finest cruisers
and gunboats in tne world, it was deemed
advisable to begin the construction of ves
sels for the heavy line of battle, and I
drew a bill for the construction of tbe first
three battle-shipsâ the Oregon, Indiana
and Massachusetts â and in the same bill
provided for the construction of a fast
coinmerce-jiestroyer, for wnich I placed
ihe limit at one knot faster than had ever
been required for the minirnun speed,
namely, twenty-one knots. The offspring
of this provision was the construction of
the Columbia, which made twenty-three
knots an hour.
"In the bill providing for the first three
battle-pbip3 of the American navy, acting
upon the same principle which had caused
â¢me to insist upon the establishment of the
steel plants in this country, I inaugurated
in the House bill a bill requiring that at
least one of those great battle-ships should
be constructed oil the Pacific Coast, re
garding, as I always have, the building up
and maintenance of a great private ship
building establishment on this coast as
one of the essentials of our naval depart
ment of National defense.
"It is conceded to-day by the naval ex
perts of the world that the three battle
ships we have now in commission are
superior to any vessels of their class that
have been built In any otuer part of the
world. In the recent session oi Congress,
I, as chairman of the committee, drafted
and managed the passage through the
House of a bill providing for three more
first-class battle-slaps, to be superior in
some respects to those already con
structed, and also a number of torpedo
boats, concerning which the same provi-
Bion was made that a Dortion of them
should be constructed on the Pacific Coast.
So tnat out of nine battle-ships that have
thus far been authorized by Congress from
the beginning of the new navy it has been
my food fortune to draw tip ts;e bills pro
viding for tbe construction'of six."
Mr. Boutelle has expressed himself in
the most complimentary manner in re
gard to the magnificent work performed
at the great shipbuilding piace in San
Francisco, the Union Iron Works. He
remembered distinctly the skepticism with
which many people commented upon the
proposal to establish a shipbuilding es
tablishment here on the Pacific Coast to
undertake what was then only experi
mental in any part of our country the
construction of a great modern warship.
He expressed pride in the resources of
his country so stimulated by the splendid
achievements of the Union Iron Works in
putting afloat a class of warships unsur
passed in speed, power and efficiency by
any vessels ever floated for any navy in
the world.
FATHER NUGEST'S ADDRESS.
Does JM Criticize Ireland, but Cham
pions free Silver.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 19.â Key. Father
Nugent of Dcs Moines addressed, an en
thusiastic audience to-night in Central
Music Hall in denunciation of the gold
standard. The hall was crowded to its
Btanding-room capacity, and police were
needed to keep others from getting inside.
There was a tedious delay of an hour and
a half before the priest entered the hall
â with National Committeeman Gaban of
Illinois and others, and when the speaker
appeared on the stage to relieve those who
had tilled in the time he was given a re
ception which was wildly demonstrative.
Those who had come with the expectation
of hearing Father Nugent make a critical
reply to Arcbbisnop Ireland, as was re
ported he would do, were disappointed, as
the prie=t did not once refer to his supe
rior or that prelate's famous utterance.
Father Nngent said he had been in
duced to study the money question from
both sides by receiving a letter from the
.McKiniey and Hobart Club of Phila
delphia, which stated that there were
"great moral questions in this campaign
Which the clergy could not afford to over
look." He believed the club was right
and addressed the audience on the theo
logical phase of those great moral prob
lems. He had been forced to the convic
tion that the universal hard times were
caused by the demonetization of silver
and that prosperity to all would only come
with its remonetization. Money was the
first thing and wages the last to consider.
The ' confederated money powers were
playing with marked cards and they were
asking the common people to have con
fidence and play square. He called this a
confidence game. Honest money was
from the man and not in the dollar. The
biggest scoundrels in the country were
carrying in their pockets this honest
dollar. The present dollar was a robber
doliar and tne man who held it was a
robber. Gold was timid when it saw a
rival, but when it was alone it was a bully
end went up to the people and said:
"You'll have to wear a McKiniey button."
HARRIET MONROE'S SUIT.
It Reaches the Supreme Court With New
Complications.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct 19.â Miss
Harriet Monroe's suit for damages against
the New York World by reason of the
premature publication of her "World's
Fair Ode" was brought to the attention of
the Supreme Court of the United States
to-day to dismiss or affirm the judgment
in the case. A judgment for $5000 was
given against the World, from which it
appealed to tne Supreme Court last April.
In the brief of counsel, supporting the
motion, the rules of court permitting
counsel to ask for 10 per cent damages in
cases which are offered to the Supreme
Court, purely for delay, is discussed ana
its applicability urged. Counsel says:
â¢'The conduct of plaintiff in error in
committing the piracy wa3 arroeant and
cynical. Its conduct since the judgment,
especially in suing out this writ of error,
has been vexatious and oppressive. It
asks the court to sanction a legal proposi
tion which hns never before been con
tented by the bar, nor dreamed of by any
court in the land. It has delayed the de
fendant in error, has superseded her judg
ment and execution, and subjected Her to
a large additional expense. These dam
ages will not reimburse Miss Monroe from
the damage which the wrongful issuance
of this writ has caused her."
BRYAN'S TOUR IN
THE STATE OF OHIO
Short Speeches Made Dur
ing the Brief Stops at
Stations.
Open Approval of the Request
for Republicans to Display
Old Glory.
SCME SILLY ASSERTIONS MADE.
Says the Advocates of Scund Money
and Protection Have Appealed to
Church Societies.
LIMA, Ohio, Oct. 19.â The enthusiasm
which marked William J. Bryan's previous
sallies to Ohio during this campaign be
gan to show itself anew on his fourth en
try to Major McKinley's State this morn
ing. His train left Detroit at 4:40 a. M.
and reached Toledo at 6:30. Two or three
hundred men in the Union station called
for Mr. Bryan, and arising from his berth
and after making a hasty toilet, ne went
out on the platform and talked to them.
Fifteen minutes only were spent at Toledo.
Stops were made by th& train at Perrys
burg, Weston, Dashler, Leipsic, Ottawa
and Columbus Grove.
The bigpest crowd was at Leipsic, reached
at 8:25. Mr. Bryan made a short address
there. Brief remarks were made at all the
other piaces mentioned and at each the
candidate was deceived with enthusiasm.
Several thousand people welcomed Mr.
Bryan at Lima. He read extracts from
Chairman Hanna's American flag letter
published yesterday and in commenting
on it said:
My friends, it is the first time that I know of
that f have ever agreed with the chairman of
the Republican National Committee, and I
want to sign my name to his letter and ask all
those who believe in the ideas set forth there
to display the flag on the 31st oi October, be
cause there is not a thing in that letter but
what we advocates of free silver indorse.
Another audience of several thousand
was at Wapokoneta. As at Lima Mr.
Bryan spoke from a stand in the town.
He and Mrs. Bryan were escorted to the
i place where tne meeting was held, in front
J of the City Hall, by sixteen men in silver
| caps and one in a yellow cap. The gather-
I ing proved to be one of the most enthusi
i astic the nominee bad addressed, and
every point in his address, which followed
his old lines of discussion of the money
question, was wildly cheered. Thirty
minutes werespent at Wapok oneta, and
at 11:30 the candidate's special train re
sumed its journey.
George Marshall, Democratic candidate
for Congress, introduced Mr. Bryan to 500
people at Sydney, and the National nomi
nee made a brief speech. Piqua turned
out the banner crowd of the day up to
that time. It numbered about 6000, in
cluding many who came from near-by
| communities. During the twenty min
utes spent there Mr. Bryan made a
speech. A number of auditors wore the
yellow badges seen so frequently among
the crowds addressed by Mr. Bryan. But
the Bryan supporters, not to be outdone,
had distributed around the town before
the meeting, similar in color, some bear
ing the wons, "Gold â nit," and others
simply "Nit." At Troy 200 people heard
Mr. Bryan speak from the rear platform
of his private car.
At Hamilton Mr. Bryan was cheered
with heartiness on his way to the square
under escort of the Miami Club and other
organizations in uniform. He was intro
duced by ex-Governor Campbell.
Dayton gave Mr. Bryan tbe most wild
demonstration of the da)'. In fact two
enthusiastic greetings were accorded him
there. The first was not on the pro
gramme. In the run of his special to
Hamilton it passed through Dayton. A
crowd of nearly if not quite 10,000 sur
rounded the train in the railway station
during its short wait there ana cheered
I the nominee for several minutes. On the
I return to D yton from Hamilton the prin-
I cipal exercises of the day took place. Mrs.
! Bryan was conveyed to the fair grounds,
two miles distant, in an open carriage
drawn by four horses through streets lined
with shouting thousands. The nominee's
appearance on the platform erected oppo
site the grand stand was the signal for an
j ovation there. People tilled the grand
stand to its utmost capacity and a tre
mendous crowd was drawn up in front of
the platform. Visitors in creat numbers
who came by special trains and from
nearer points in carriages and wagons
were in the throng. Mr. Bryan lost some
time at Hamilton and was so far behind
his schedule that he cut his speech short.
He saia in part:
There is not an argument that can be made
against bimetallism which has not been
answered over and over again. And in spite
of this fact our opponents are appealing to
every class of people and trying to arouse a
selfish Interest in favor of the gold standard.
One of the last ap Deals has been to church
societies and letters have been sent from the
Republican National Committee to the vari
ous missionary societies. We go upon the
theory that the only permanent prosperity
that can come to this country is a prosperity
whose blessings begin with the people who
produce wealth and go to all the other classes
of society.
ZANEBVILLE, Ohio, Oct. 20. â More
than three hours behind schedule, Mr.
Bryan reached Zanesville at 12:30 o'clock
this morning during a heavy rain, but
found three large audiences waiting for
him. Although very tired he kept his en
gagement 3to speak. After leaving Wash
! ington Courthouse, he made speeches at
Chiliicotbe, Circleville, Lancaster and New
Lexington. At each of these towns he
was given an enthusiastic welcome. He
left Zanesville at 1:12 a. m., and will speak
at Martins Ferry at 7:30 a. m.
PROTESTS AGAINST FUSION.
Why Watson' s Letter Was Withheld From
the J'ublie.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 19.âTo
night N. A. Dunning, until recently editor
of the National Watchman, the organ of
the Populists at Washington, and who is a
close friend of Mr. Watson and recently
returned from a visit to him at Thomson,
Ga., when asked what he knew about the
letter of acceptance, said: "I was a guest
at Mr. Watson's home when the letter of
acceptance was written and read the first
draft of the letter two or three times very
carefully. Ido not think lam betraying
any confidence when I say that it is writ
ten in Mr. Watson's usual vigorous style.
T.ie qusstion of fusion is handled without
gloves and backed up with arguments that
cannot be met. The action of the National
Committee is severely condemned and a
general protest made against the manner
iv which he has been treated since the
convention."
THOMSON, Ga., Oct. 19.â Mr. Watson
was shown to-night a telegram from Wash
ington in which Chairman Butler said ha
has not received Mr. Watson's letter and
had wired him to this effect. Mr. Wat
son read the telegram and simply replied:
"I ha^e nothing to say on the subject be
yond what I have already said."
"If Chairman Butler persists in the

statement that he has not received the
letter, will you give it to the public?"
"I do not expect to do so at the present
time." , " Â,
"If he has not received your letter, will
you send him another?"
"I may do so."
"Will it be another copy of the same
letter or will you write him in a different
letter?"
â¢'I prefer to say, simply, that I will
probably write him again."
"Do you expect to meet Mr. Jones in
Atlanta to-morrow?"
"No, I leave to-morrow for Alabama,
but will stop over in Atlanta."
Mr. Watson was asked if the differences
in Kansas would be arranged. He re
plied : "I do not Jsnow, but it is full time
it was being done. \ Precious time is flying
fast and there is Â»one to be wasted. I
have expressed my willingness to an equal
division of electors, and I can do no more
than that. Ihe situation is unchanged
from w,hst it was when you saw me last,
and there is absolutely no news that I can
give you."

JONES' WILD APPEAL
The Democratic Leader Talks About Co-
ercion by Corporations.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 19.â The following
appeal and warning, addressed to "The
American People," was given to the press
to-night by Chairman Jones on behalf of
the Democratic committee:
In view of the fact that great corporations,
with scarcely an exception, aud many of tbe
large employers of labor in the United States
are engaged in a concerted effort to coerce
their employes into voting at the approaching
election against their own convictions, I deem
it my duty to call upon ell thoie who believe
in the supremacy of the law and the untram
meled freedom of the individual in the right
of exercising' the ballot, to use their utmost
effort to prevent this most flagrant act of law
lessness, for if this conspiracy succeeds, gov
ernment by corporations will have succeeded
government by the people.
Corporations have no powers â except those
conferred specifically in the laws creating
them. The right to coerce voters or to inter
fere with American citizens in the exercise of
their rlphts at the balloi box are not named iv
any of the;e acts of incorporation, and when
corporations attempt to exercise such powers
they become law breakers, and the good of
society demands that they be rebuked and
punished. During the present contest which
involves questions of the greatest moment to
the American people, men have been com
pelled by fear of losing their piaces to join
clubs and march in processions in behalf of a
cause they detest.
Requests from corporation bosses to vote the
Republican ticket, which are perfectly under
stood to convey a threat of discharge in case of
refusal, are made every day to men who dare
not resent the insult. The corporations which
thus appeal to force and fraud strike at the
very foundation of Republican government
and the lives of free constituents.
The perpetration of tnis outrage upon free
suffrage will work its own cure. An indignant
people, jealous of their rights, will demand
that the Legislature^ State and National, shall
proceed at once by rigorous measures to pre
vent the possibility of a repetition of such at
tempts hereafter. In the meantime the suc
cess of the present conspiracy must be pre
vented. The National Committee, backed by
the full power of the Democratic organization
in every State of the Union, pledges itself that
every scoundrel, whether public officer or pri
vate citizen, who is detected in n violation of
the law shall be vigorously prosecuted and
sent to the penitentiary If possible.
James K. /ones, Chairman.
ONLY A STUPID SCHEME.
William Lyman' s Opinion of the Irish
hepubliean Federation.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 19.- President
Lyman of the Irish National Alliance fur
nished tbe following statement to the
United Associated Presses with a request
that it be gent to its papers:
New York, Oct. 19, 1896.
To Irishmen at home and abroad: A circular
is being sent broadcast throughout Ireland
and Great, Britain by a body styling itself
"The Irish Republican Federation" calling
for subscriptions, and asking Irishmen to a
pledge subscribing to its principles and will
ingness to take up arms. My name is set forth
as president of Ihis federation, in which a
man calling himself Patrick Feeney seems to
be the prime mover. I have not given au
thority to any person to use my name, and I
hereby warn Irishmen to have nothing to do
with this Irish Republican Federation. It ap
pears to me to be either another stupid scheme
of the British Home Office or the work of some
unwise person. William Lyman.
liri/nn Denies the Stories.
WASHINGTON COURTHOUSE, Ohio,
Oct. 19.â W. J. Bryan to-day denied the
report which appeared in Leslie's Woekly,
that be had applied to the manager of the
Herald-square Theater, New York, last
January for the position of press agent.
The denial was called forth by several
other newspaper statements saying that
he had been on the stage, that lie had
thought about going on the stage, and
that he had writ;en a criticism of a play.
Mr. Bryan said there was no truth in any
of them, adding that at the time he was
reported as contemplating the stage ho
was writing histories of free silver and lec
turing.
Candidate Jones Mctires.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. Oct. 19.â 0. D. Jones,
Populist candidate for Governor, to-night
handed in his resignation to the Populist
State Committee. He saia he preferred
not in any way to impede tho success of

His resignation was accepted and Lon
Stevens, the Democratic candidate, in
dorsed.

EXCITEMENT IN
TIE WHEAT PIT
Scenes Among Veterans
That Recall the War
Times.
Every Speculator Appears to Be
Making Big Money at
Chicago.
PHIL AEMOUR A HEAVY BUYEE
Constant Increase in the Demand From
Foreign Lands Causes a Large
Profit in This Country.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 19.â 1n the midst
of a scene of wild excitement, sucb as
veteran traders recall in war times, De
cember wheat opened on tne Chicaeo
Board of Trade to-day anywhere from
78}4 to 19%, after closing Saturday at 75%.
It was an average 3 cent jump to begin
the furor with, and it cftme on like a bomb
in the pit. The marfcet was not all up
ward. It oscillated between Saturday's
closing price and the top, reacted to 7834,
then went to 79^ and flashed all around
this point with a bewildering series of
changes.
Before the commotion in the pit began,
the English cables posted told the feverish
crowd tnat more wheat was wanted by the
United Kingdom. London, Liverpool,
Paris and Berlin contributed their quota
of bull news, and served to tune the ex
cited crowd to the pitch of a 3-cent rise at
the opening. Traders on both 6ides of the
market realized it was a short market. A
feature of the day was that everybody was
making money. Paying business came to
the brokers from Tacoma to New Bruns
wick. P. D. Armour was a heavy buyer,
and there was a report that John Cudahy
sold big lots of his wheat holdings, but it
was not supposed he sold all of his long
line. The boisterous opening of the Min
neapolis market, where the opening price
was almost 5 cents above the closing price
Saturday, was taken as evidence of the
strength of the Northwestern market.
Wbdat could only be got when men could
be found who were willing to let go.
President Baker said: "The activity is
due to strong foreign markets, Liverpool
showing an advance of six cents a bushel.
Great Britain wants our wheat, but it is
absurd to talk of wheat being shipped to
Argentina.' 1
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 19.â When the
pointer on the wheat dial at the Mer
chants' Exchange was set at the opening
to-day it indicated 81% cents. Tne price
quoted on September wueat at the closing
hour Saturday was 78% cents. Less fjan
forty-eipht hours later it had advanced 3
cents. The total advance since the close
Friday has been 6% cents. The total ad-,
vance in the price of this year's crop has
been over 30 cents a bushel. There was
great excitement, though but little anx
iety, as nearly all the short traders were
protected by cash holdings. The price
hovered around 82 dfenU for awhile and
then began to ease off. It went back to
the opening price and continued to decline
until it dropped to 80% cents. The mar
ket closed at TO% centsâ one cent above
the close Saturday.
All these fluctuations followed the trend
of New York prices. It is fcnown that
three months ago all tbe local traders
began buying in other markes, for ad
vance, mainly in Chicago. There is no
difficulty anticipated in handling the
large receipts that the advance will call
out. Car service is ample and elevators
well equipped.
President Spencer of the exchange says
the advance is not a manipulated one.
"The advance," said he, "is due to the
universally short crop. The stock of red
winter wheat is unusually small. The
crop in India was almost a total failure.
In Argentine and France the output was
unusually small. There was a medium
c r op in Germany, but it was spoiled by
rains. The same conditions prevailed in
the nortu of Egypt. The Russian crop is
short nearly 100,000,000 bushels. Nat
urally the demand is greater than tne sup
ply. Though the crop here was small
this year it was large compared to the
crops of Europe. The foreign countries
are looking to us for their wheat."
BALTIMORE, Md., Oct. 19.â The rush
of grain to Europe has caused ocean
freight rates from this port to jump at a
lively rate. To-day's quotations to Liver
pool are twopence a bushel higher than
those offered a few weeks ago. Ship
brokers say that, more business at those
rates is being offered than at this season
for several years past. Vessels have been
chartered at good rates as far al.eai as
next March. As a result of this activity
every available steamer and sailing vessel
has been pressed into service and several
representative shipbrokers say tbe supply
of vessels is still unequal to tbe demand.
SHARP ADVANCE IN ENGLAND.
Scenes in the Exchanges .Remind One of
War Times.
LIVERPOOL, Eng., Oct. 19.â Wneat to
day opened at .'i l 1 dearer, and after an
exciting trade continued firm at 5); v 'd ad
vance. Later the market gave way some
what on realizing, and closed nervous at
an advance of 5d over Saturday's closing
tieures. The sales to-day amounted to
205,000 quarters.
LONDON, Esq., Oct. 19.â The Times,
commenting to-morrow upon the state of
the London market, will say that the rise
in the price of wheat in America caused
excitement, and when the American
opening cables were received there was a
scene such as is not usually seen except
in time of war.
The paper adds that the advance ap
pears to be cniefly due to the sale of
American wheat for India, which fright
ened the speculators a cood deal. Cautious
observers think that a rise of 5 shillings
per quarter in a week fully discounts the
effect of the abnormal Indian demand.
JAMES ENDS UBADELL.
Heath of a Grandson of the Famous
Civil Engineer.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 19.â Word was
received in this city yesterday of the death
of Captain James Eads Ãbsdell of the
Somerset Light Infantry, British army, at
Chitral, India, from fever. He was a son
of John A. Ãbsdell of this city and a
grand6on of the late Captain James EadÂ«,
the famous civil engineer, who built the
wonderful system of jetties at the mouth
of the Mississippi River. He was born in
Southampton, England, 26 years ago, and
was educated at Eton and Sandowne.
John A. ÃbsdeJl, tie father of Captain
Ãbsdell, married Genevieve, the daughter
of Captain .lame Eads, and is the execu
tor of Captain Eads' estate. Upon the
death of Captain Eads. Mr. Ãbsdell took
charge of the jetty system at Port Eaas,
and he has managed it ever since then.
Under the terms of the contract which
Captain Eads made with the United States
Government, Captain Eads or his heirs
were to have full control of the Mississippi
jetties for a period of twenty years, and if
during that time tlie jetties proved success
fui in keeping the great river from over
flowing its bauks and doing damage, as it
periodically did before Tne jetties were
built, Captain Eads or his heirs were to
receive a certain sum of money payable in
installments.
Theia.Â«t payment was $1,500,000. The

CRIMES OF A HIGHWAYMAN.
Albert H. Downen, a San Jose Murderer
and Train Robber, Caught by the
Denver Police.
DENVER, Colo., Oct. 19.â The lone
highwayman who has held up twenty
three different parties in and around
Denver, protecting himself from capture
by the free use of his revolvers, proves to
be, by his own confession, a California
murderer. He also committed the mur
der of Joel A^hworth in Denver, which
raised great excitement at the time of the
crime, and which was ascribed to the
jealousy of a woman.
His name is Albert H. Downen. He
was brought in in a police drag net this
evening and broke down. He stated that
in 1885 he murdered a man in Bt. James
JPark, San Jose, Cal., who resisted his at
tempt to rob him, and a few days later he
tilled a woman whom he tried to rob. rie
was at one time an inmate of San Quentin
penitentiary. He was engaged in robbing
Southern Pacific trains urevious to this.
He went to Montana after his release
from San Quentin and then drifted to
Cheyenne and Denver. He says he will
plead guilty to murder when arraigned in
court.
COULD NOT STEAL THE CHURCH.
Sacrilegious Criminal* Carry Off the
Cornerstone of the Hdifler.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 19.â New Jer
sey burglars are getting pretty mean. The
town of Pearl River, just across the New
York line, is much exercised over the dis
covery that some enterprising but sacri
legious criminals have stolen the corner
stone of the Methodist church.
They did not steal the church, pre
sumably because they did not want it, and
did not carry the stone very far; but they
pried it far enough out and away from the
building to carry away tne tin box which
had -been placed in it when the foundation
of the church was laid. The tin box con
tained a number of papers that were val
uable. The cornerstone was very large,
and the thieves mast have spent consid
erable time iv getting it loose from tbe
mortar. A reward has been offered for
their arrest. Tne box also contained ass
gold piece. I: is thought that the hot
financial discussion of the pending cam
paign may have reminded some old cit
izen of tne presence of the gold coin in
the cornerstone, but so far the crime baa
not been laid to tbe door of any particular
party.
GET BULLETS, NOT CASH
Six Footpads Attempt to Hold
Up the Wrong Men in
Chicago.
One of the Garroters Fatally Shot
and Three Others Captured
by the Police.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 19.â A bold at
tempt at robbery was made early this
morning and that it was unsuccessful was
due entirely to the fact that the man who
was selected for the victim refused to
occupy that position. In fact he so com
pletely reversed the intended programme
that while he escaped uninjured himself
one of the would-be robbers is in the
hospital and three others are in the City
Prison.
Last night the Polish Society gave a
dance. The attendance was large and the
treasurer, Michael Mahanuk, had $-00 on
hand before the night was over. The
dance kept up until an early hour this
morning. Then Mahanuk gathered the
proceeds together and started for home,
accompanied by a friend, George Maurow
ski. The two men bad gone but a com
paratively short distance when they were
surrounded by six men, who had been
concealed in the deep shadow at a street
corner.
Ttie order was at once given for the two
men to throw up their hands, and the
order was accompanied with a threat of
death if they did not at once comply.
Mahanuk, however, proved not to be
made of yielding material. When he
raised his hands one of them contained a
reTolver, with which he opened fire on the
footpads. His first shot was effective. He
hit one of the robbers in the groin, and
with a cry of pain the man fell to the
ground. The five other men were fright
ened by the reception they got, and fled
down the street, Mahanuk firing a shot in
the air to hurry their flight
The pistol shots attracted the attention
of the police in tne neighborhood, and
they were on the scene quickly enough to
pursue the fleeing men. Three of them
were caught and lodged in jail. Tbe two
others succeeded iv escaping.
The wounded man, William Spank, was
removed to a hospital. The doctors con
sider his wound very serious, if not fatal.

JAPAN'S CABINET
NOW COMPLETED
New Blood Added to Those
Who Control Public
Affairs.
Count Okuma's Elevation Will
Cause the Retirement of
Minister Toru.
GEEAT DISCONTENT IN KOREA.
The King Is the Leader of the Aati
lapanese Feeling in the
Peninsula.
TOKIO, Japan, Oct. 2.â Tbe new Ja
panese Cabinet has b2en at length com
pleted. It is chiefly remarkable for the
fact that only one portfolioâ that of com
municationsâhas fallen to a Choshu man,
by no means a statesman of prominence.
Thus, for the first time since the com
mencement of the Meiji era, the two great
clans of Satsuma and Choshu have drifted
apart; in every previous Ministry they
stood side to side. It is not likely, how- j
ever, that the separation will be perma- .
nent. Several of tbe most eminent Sat
suma leaders, now out of office, will doubt
less be found in alliance with the Chosbu
men when the latter return to power.
The new Japanese Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs, Count Oku ma, has already
become the butt of vehement journalistic
attack. He is recognized as the leadine
spirit in the Cabinet. A significant fact is
that the newspaper most conspicuous for
its diatribes against him is the organ of
the National Unionists, the party that
holds the balance of power in ihe lower
house of the Diet. That means, of course,
that the Cabinet will find itself in a minor
ity in the House, and that an appeal to the
country will be necessary. Count Okuma
is a man well on in the fifties, but he
carries his years very lightly. The tenible
shock sustained by his system when his
right leg was shattered by a bomb, six
years ago, seems not to have impaired his
energy or capacity in any degree. It
would be difficult to say whether he has
shown greater ability as a financier or a
diplomat during his long career of public
life. Unfortunrtely, his usefulness in
either sphere is impaired by the fact that
his enemies are legipn.
Very little doubt is entertained that the
accession of a Cabinet in which Count
Okuma is prominent will entail the resig
nation of Hoshi Toru, now Japanese
Minister in Washington. Mr. Hoshi,
during the years of his political activity
as a leader of the Liberal party, became
conspicuous for his vehement attacks
upon the Progressionists, whose chief was
Count Okuma, and the Progressionists re
venged themselves by forming a cabal to
oust Mr. Hoshi from his position as presi
dent of tbe House of Representatives, j
The attempt succeeded, but it will always
stand as one of tbe most discreditable
chapters in Japanese parliamentary an
nals. Probably Count Okuma had very
little to do with it. but there cannot be
much possibility of Mr. Hoshi's continu
ing to serve in a capacity where Count
Okuma would be his immediate chief.
Japanese discontent about the state of
affairs in Korea grows stronger every day.
It can no longer be doubted that the King
is the leader of anti-Japanese feeling in
tbe peninsula. The shock of the emeute !
that cost the Queen's life produced such
an effect on his Majesty's weak mind that
he cannot shake off an abiding fear of the
Japanese. He is persuaded that if he
leaves the shelter of ttie Russian legation
he will an once become a mark for Jap
anese swords; he rails against Count
Inouye for having permitted such a Min
ister as Viscount Miura to come to Seoul,
and he denounces as a judicial fiasco the
trial of the Viscount and his fellow-con
spirator? at Hiroshima.
The King has never wielded much power
or exercised much influence in his realm.

INSURGENTS SHOW HUMANITY
Consul-General Lee Granted a Leave
of Absence, bnt It Has No
Significance.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 19.â T0 show the
contrast between treatment accorded to
rebel prisoners by the Spaniards and that
shown to Spanish captives by the insur
gent leaders the following recent incidents
are mentioned :
In the fight which General Melquizo had
with General Maceo's forces a short time
ago Melquizo captured forty rebels, whom
he ordered shot on the spot, and in the
recent engagement between Maceo's troops
and the Spaniards under General Bernal
the latter caused twenty-two prisoners to
be shot, including a young girl and two
older women. Bernal says that he saw
one of these women bidden in the brush
near by and he paid no attention to her at |
first, believing she was a refugee, but after
tbe fight was over a stray shot picked off
one of his soldiers, when they all turned
on her, she killing seventeen before she
was captured and killed.
This statement is positively true as the
facts were heard from the lips of General
Bernal iv person when he was inter
Viewed on his arrival in Havana, and he
confessed them without shame to all the re
porters who silently listened to his "el
ploits."
With the forty men killed by Melquizo
there were four women and a child, but j
he does not know whether the child was
abandoned in the woods or killed. They
tried to force the women to tell them the \
whereabouts of Maceo and his plans, but
the only words they got out of them were
that the Spaniards were cowardly dogs,
and this so enraged Melquizo that he or
dered them shot, they all dying with the
cry of "Viva Cuba Libre."
This affair and that of Bernal shooting
twenty-two captives clearly show how the
Spaniards continue their relentless butch
ery and do not pardon a single man cap
tured in the field, while the Cubans pur
sue an exactly contrary course.
The new trial of the men captured on
the filibustering schooner Competitor
began to-day before an ordinary naval
court-martial, Alfredo La Borde of New
Orleans, the leader of the party, and Owen !
Milton of Kansas being examined. Their
evidence did not materially differ from
that {:iven at the previous trial, which re- i
suited in tbe death sentence being im
posed on the five prisoners, who, in addi
tion to La Borde and Milton, are William
Kinle, an Englishman, Elias Bediah and
Theoaore Maza, both Cubans.
Consul-General L3e was not present, he
not having been advised that the trial
would begin to-day. The case of Leavitt
and Barnett was not called.
MADRID, Spain. Oct. 19.â A dispatch
frcm Havana says that in a recent en
gagement the rebel chiefs, Leit, Vidal,
Jarapa and Escotta, were killed. Maceo's
adjutant was also killed.
WASHINGTON, D. a, Oct. 19.â Co
nsul-General Fitzhugh Lee . has been
granted leave of absence from his post
in Havana and â will return to his
home in November. As the result of
the return all sorts of Cuban rumors
have been prevalent, but it is as-
Berted to-night by an official of the State
Department that such references are not
justified. It is said that General Lee re
turns to the United States solely on ac
count of bis health, and that he will go
back to his post as soon as he recuperates
from the effect of hi i residence in the
island. It is denied that there is any po
litical significance in his being granted
leave of absence at this time.
SAVANNAH, Ga., Oct. 19.â The filibus
tering steamer Three Friends, which has
been ostensibly looking for wrecks, es
caped the revenue cutter Morrill, which
has been following her since she left Wil
mington, somewhere off Tybee, last night.
The Morrill lost track of her, and, not see
ing her any wnere this morning, came into
port here for coal.
FLOODS THREATEN HALIFAX.
Much Damage A/ready Done and a Great
Calamity Will Ensue If a
Reservoir Breaks.
HALIFAX, N. S., Oct. 19. -There w.as a
tremendous rainfall in this region yester
day, last night and early this morning.
The storm during the night was very
fierce, the wind blowine violently in
Eqnalla and the rain coming down in a
perfect torrent. None of this morning's
outgoing trains left on time. The damage
about the city streets is considerable.
The famous public gardens are flooded
and badly injured, and it is said that a
man named Thompson was drowned
there while attempting to open a sluice In
one of the ponds to allow the accumula
tion of water to run into the sewers. A
part of the North Common has been trans
formed into a lake and a number of cellars
in the western section have been inun
dated. In the suburbs some of the resi
dents had to raft from thrir houses to
their barns this morning.
The City Engineer says that $20,000
would not place tbe city in the condition
it was previous to the storm. If the water
in Long Lake rises much higher there will
be fears for the breaking of the water
works dam, and the village of Herring
Cove would be wiped out. The
Herring Cove road bridges have already
been wasued away. Measures are now
being taken to prevent the disaster. The
storm inflicted considerable local damage
about Truro, and a number of bridges
were swept away.
ENGLAND ANXIOUS TO SETTLE.
British Embassador Pauncefote Coming
With Propositions to Arbitrate
Venezuelan Boundaries.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 19.â With refer
ence to the assertion published in the
Speaker Saturday that Sir Julian Pauuce
fote, the British Embassador to tbe
United States, on his return to his post
would be the bearer of instructions that
will secure a favorable solutiou of the
Venezuelan frontier dispute, certain
papers publish a news agency statement
whic. purports to be official to the effect
that it is a patent fact that Sir Julian has
all along been charged with a mission di
rected to a settlement of the question.
He has started for the United States
with certain instructions, and the nego
tiations will be reopened upon his arrival,
bin it is too soon to say whether the
British proposals are likely to be accepted.
The statement adds:
"Happily a better feeling is being mani
fested between the people, and it fre
quently happens that such manifestatians
help to good conclusions, that would not
otherwise be practical."
Herr Lery Stabbed to Death.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 19.â A story
in circulation here yesterday and duly
cabled that a lire had occurred in the resi
dence of Herr Meyer Levy, the Berlin
Counselor of Justice, Saturday night, re
sulting in the death of Herr Levy s chil
dren from suffocation, proves to bs un
true, but the real facts are even more
serious. Herr Meyer Levy, president of
the Berlin bar, was attacked by four men
in his bedroom at his residence in Moh
renstrasse and stabbed to death. His wife
at the same time was seriously wounded
by the assassins, who escaped.

come you to Santa Cruz."
Chairman Mattison, in introducing Wil
liam H. Barnes of San Francisco, grand
scribe of the Odd Fellows of California,
paid testimony to the esteem in which Mr.
Barnes was held among fraternal socie
ties. The worthy scribe, passing from a
tribute to the past nnd present glories of
Santa Cruz, said : "We revere it, as the old
padres did of otd when they planted the
holy cross. We come to yon with the
clink of the gavel and the three links of
friendship, love and truth. We bring you
a society whose benificence encircles the
globe. We have behind us 11,000 lodges
and 850,000 men; 4.00 R-bekah lodges,
with 260,000 sisterÂ«; 1700 encampments,
with 140,000 member.*, and our banner
shelters over 1,000,000 Odd Fellows.
"Our aim is to uplift, upbuild and to
shield the widow and the orphan. We
want no pauprrs and we want no paupers'
grave?. We live in our society to foster
self-help, to widen our sphere of good, to
broaden our love, to be charitable to all
und 10 the lowliest equally with the high
est. W* have spent $70,000,000 in charity
and $3, C0) 000 a year in relief. We have
lived to love, we will live to love and we
are reaping a harvest of present happiness
la Santa Cruz which is only a foretaste of
the harvest of peace the Great Protector
will give us when we cross to that bourne
from which none return. From our hearts
we visiting Odd Fellows thank you of
Santa Cruz."
The balance of the evening was devoted
to a literary and musical entertainmeni,
of which the leading features were a grand
chorus, "A Sous of Welcome," by forty
voices, a vocal solo by Mrs. Frank March
of Cambria and a series of most humorous

BAD WOOL SENT ABROAD.
Growers Would Do Well by Selecting Set-
ter Quality for Shipment.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 19.â United
States Consul Meeker at Bradford reports
to the State Department over 1,000,000
pounds of American wool was soid in Eng
land early in the fall at an average of 9
cents per pound and these sales
would have continued except for the ad
vance in freight rates and stiffer prices at
home, so that there arestiil large amounts
held for sale in England waiting higner
prices. Complaint is made of the quulity
of this wool which is of the merino short
staple type, and buyers complain that the
Boston shippers selected the very worst
type they baa to send over. In one lot
there was 78 per cent waste and British
merchants strongly advise American wool
buyers, if they hope to keep their place in
the British market, to educate growers,
through agricultural papers, so they may
bring their wool to market in better condi
tion.
Enfi Id Laid tn Ashen.
ATHOL, Mass., Oct. 19.â Fire to-day
destroyed the whole business portion of
Enfield. The blaze began in a bakery and
made rapid headway, takiug in Gould's
tinshop, the Masonic and G.A. R. Hall
block; thence leaping to the opposite cor
ner of the two main streets it burned a
long block of stores and a dwelling be
yond. Meanwhile the wind carried sparks
across the river, igniting the lumber-yard
of Gillette & Flint, containing about
100,000 feet, which was entirely burned
out, as was the lumber of the Boston and
Albany Railroad Company, across the
track from Gillette's. Twelve firms were
burned out. The loss has not been esti
mated.

ALASKA SMUGGLERS BOILED.
Liquor Found in Sugar-Barrels in the
Umntilla'* Cargo.
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Oct. 19 â
In discharging the damaged cargo from
the steamship Umatiha to-day nnother
Alaska smuggling scheme was exposed.
In the cargo was a large consignment of
barreled sugar destined to a leading
Alaska firm. The action of the salt water
malted the sugar, and in the center of
each barrel was found a large case of
spirits. An investigation reveals the fact
that in recent months a large quantity of
supposed sugar has been shipped to
Alaska, and it is now reckoned that thou
sands of gallons of whisky and brandy
have been smuggled into the Territory in
this manner. Customs authorities are in
vestigating.
Failure at Santa Maria.
SANTA MARIA, Oau, Oct. 19.-Stephen
A. Westler has filed a petition in in
solvency. He places his liabilities at
$4044 nnd his assets at $2700. The hearing
of this petition is set for October 30. The
petitioner is a local capitalist and the
original owner of a large and important
addition to this town. This petition fol
lows upon the heels of a series of transfers
of valuable real estate made by the peti
tioner during the past few weeks and
some lively litigation wilt probably follow.
OLYMPIC PEAKS ABLAZE
Volcanic Eruptions Witnessed
by Residents of Port
Townsend.
Jets of Flame Spcut Upward While
Molten Masses Flow Down
the S opes;
PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Oct. 19.â
Several responsible residents here claim
to have seen on Friday night last what
was evidently a repetition of the volcanic
eruption in the Olympic Mountains which
startled this vicinity a year ago and was
never satisfactorily explained. The
mountains stood out' plain and distinct
in a clear sky and the phenomenon is
described as a jet of flame flying high into
the heavens at intervals, while down the
mountain side appeared two fiery streaks,
having all the outward appearance, when
inspected through powerful glasses, of
beinc molten masses.
First reports of the probable volcano
were received with derision, but several
prominent ranchers in outlying precincts
have corroborated the statements made,
alleging that the flameÃ were seen tbe
previous evening also.
Last year an exploring paity was sent
to investigate the phenomenon, but it was
unable to scale the heights, owing to the
dense smoke and raging torrents resulting
from the melting snow. The same diffi
culty will be experienced this year if an
investigation is undertaken, for the moun
tains whero the volcano is supposed to bo
located are covered by a thick coating of
perpetual snow and ice. The ascent is
particularly dangerous, and only most
hardy woodsmen would be able to succeed.
DIES IN SAN BERNARDINO
Schnaubelt, the Chicago Bomb-
Tnrower, Succumbs to
Consumption.
Succe-dei lor Years in Evading the
Folics Officials of the
Country.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Oct. 19.â
Rudolph Schnaubelt, the anarchist wno
threw the Haymarket bomb in Chicago
and for whose apprehension the police
machinery of the world has been in mo
tion ever since, died here to-day of con
sumpiion.
Schnaubelt's death, though caused pri
marily by consumption, was really due to
the wound he received in the City of Mex
ico. After tne presence of Schnau
belt had been made known by
a San Francisco newspaper in May,
1895, the anarchist fled to Mexico,
intending to continue and hide himself in
some of tbe South American countries.
In the City of Mexico he got into a street
brawl and was shot. That injury led to
the disease that carried him off.
Sentenced to t'olaotn Prison.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 19.â H. G
Ammerman was to-day sentenced to three
years in Folsom prison for robbery. Am
merman is the Oakland youth who pre
tended to be drunk in order to have the
company and assistance of Richard John
son while going home one dark night.
When the two reached a lonely spot Am
merman beat Johnson into insensibility,
and after robbing him of $40 pitched the
insensible man over the fence into a grain
field, where he was found the following
day. The young robber fled to Petaiuma,
where tie was captured while enjoying his
ill-gotten gains.
Temblor Shakes Santa Rosa.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 19.â Early
risers in this city report a sharp earth
quake shock at 6 o'clock thia mernmg.
The vibrations were quite distinct and
lasted about five seconds. The temblor
caused no damage other than disturbing
the slumbers of some light sleepers and
forcing some of the more timid of these
from their beds at an unusually early
hour. _
jiew Hope> Suspect Arrested.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 19.â A man who

SEATTLE WIFE'S
ROMANTIC FLIGHT
Elopes While Her Husband
Is Toiling on the
Yukon.
Gees With the Man Who Had
Won Her Heart Twenty
Years Ago.
HAD MOURNED HIM AS DEAD.
Old Love Is Revived When the Former
Suitor Appears at H?r
Home.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 19.â Pathos and
romance abound in a story of real life in
volving the elopement of Mrs. Charles
Ross and eight children, the eldest twelve
years of age, with Frank Mclntyre, her
former lover. Though they fled in
August, the story became known only
when Ross, who sought a fortune last
March on the Yukon, returned to Seattle
on Saturday to find tbat his wife had gone
with the sweetheart of her girlhood days,
having sold everything they possessed in
the way of worldly goods.
Additional interest attaches to this
strange tale of woman's infidelity and
man's perfidy from the fact that the hero
ine, whose maiden name was Marian
Powell, mourned Mclntyre as dead before
marrying Ross. In the highlands of
Scotland they grew up together, and when
twenty years of age young Mclntyre went
to sea. Marian, with her hand upon a
Bible, pledged her love and constancy
until his return, when they were to be
married. Years passed and the waves
wafted back a cruel tale of tbe sea, to the
effect that the ship had been wrecked and
her lover drowned. Believing him dead,
she married Ross, with whom she lived
happily for fifteen years.
Mclntyre returned to his native land
and learned his sweetheart's whereabouts
from the latter's sister. Having in his
absence accumulated a fortune, he started
out in questof the woman who had, twenty
years prior, promised to be Jiis bride. He
found her here. The old love reasserted
itself nnrt Mrs. Ross and her children fled
with Mclntyre, piesumably to Scotland.
Ross lias employed Lawyer Frank E.
Sims to secure his children, if possible.
He says he is also willing 10 forgive and
forget the acts of his erring wife should
she chose to come back. In the event
that Mrs, Ross is found and will not sur
render their children, the husband and
father stated that he would bestow upon
the children, $500, half of what he made
during the few months he was absent on
the Yukon. He looks upon the affair
philosophically as reeards the wife, his
chief concern being for the welfare of the
children, the eldest two of whom are re
oorted to have pathetically pleaded with
tneir mother not to take the step she did.
But their entreaties were of no avail.
Thoush only in moderate circumstances,
during the seven years' residence of the
Rosses in Seattle the husband provided
well for his family, say the neighbors, and
he was always kind ana loving to his
wife. Twice during his absence he sent
money to the ones at home, and until
Mclntyre appeared upon the scene early
in A-Jguit Mrs. Ross corresponded regu
larly with her husband, her letters being
couched in terms of love and endearment.
Mrs. Ross is rather a prepossessing
woman, probably 40 years of age, Mclntyre
being several years her senior. Dressed in
habiliments befitting a bride, the children
likewise gayly attired, all at the expense
of the rich paramour, leaving no word
save that she had gone never to return.
Mrs. Ross and the man 10 whom she had
in the flush and bloom of young woman
hood plighted her troth, left, giving to the
public neither intimation of their going
nor the place 6f their destination.
Frasrr Hirer Canneries.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 19. â The
produce of the salmon fishing season is
beginning to move out from the seaboard.
The bark Natuna cleared this week for
England with 20,482 cases of canned
salmon valued at $101,910. It is now as
certained that five new canneries will
be erected during the coming season
within the city limits of New Westminster,
which will increase the total number of
canneries on the Fras r River to over
forty. Several canneries will also be built
on the fckeena River and it is expected be
fore another year the total number of
canneries in British Columbia will be from
seventy to seventy-five and the capital
interested very largely increased.

BOGES CUIN FROM CHINA
Counterfeit Canadian Half liollars in
Circulation in Vancouver.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Oct. 19.â Bogus
Canadian half dollars made in China, as
pure as the original and an almost perfect
imitation, are in abundant circulation
here. The banks have discovered the
fraud and are warning the public. About
$2000 worth of these coins were shipped
iroin China and there is no telling how
many more are to come. The ChineÂ«e
manipulators will no doubt send them
cast and south from here. They bear the
date 1834. They are whiter than the orig
inal and larger nnd heavier.
DEATH TO SODOMA SQUIRRELS.
Thousands Killed by Partaking of a
Poisonous Mixture.
SANTA ROSA, Cal , Oct. 19.â A test of
a new squirrel poison was made on the
Calvin Holmes place, in Knights Valley, on
Saturday, resulting in the death of overSOOO
offthe little pests. The squirrels seemed
to like the poison better than anything
they had yet tasted on the Holmes ranch,
and a two-horse wagon-load of dead bun
nies was the result. The farmers of this
county are delighted to hear of the whole
sale squirrel exterminator, and the in
ventor thereof will reap a harvest of
dollars.
Lillooet's Jack the Ripper.
LILLOOET, B. C, Oct. 19.â An Indian
woman named Annie was murdered on
the outskirts of town last Friday night.
Her body was horribly mutilated, after
the manner of Jack the Ripper. Charles
Moore, employed in the vicinity, was ar
rested on suspicion Saturday night. The
evidence against him was most direct, in
cluding blood marks on his clothing and
other strong connecting links. A Coroner's
jury this afternoon pronounced him
guilty and he was committed to stand
trial at the next Assizes.
SALE OF PICACHO MINES
Twenty Claims Embraced in
Four Groups Change
Hands.
Low-Grade Properties on Which
Development Work Has
Hardly Begun.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Oct. 19.â A deed
was filed for record to-day by which D. K.
Allen transfers to George W. Ireland for
$63,000 the Golden Dream group of five
mines, the Alcyon group cf five mines,
the Oro Blanco group of rive mines, the
Noon Day group of five mines and four
millsites, situated in White Gold Basin,
in the old Picacho district, on the Colo
rado River, in this county.
Colonel I). K. Allen has been in Picacho
for several years and discovered some of
the richest mines in that section, selling
the principal properties to btephen W.
Dorsey and associat3?, of Denver, who
have set large forces of men at work de
veloping them and erecting nulls.
The veins are noted for their great size.
They are of low grade, but have the ad
vantage of being near the Colorado River,
where the cost of working is reduced to a
minimum through the convenience of
wood and water. Over $500,000 is already
invested there by Colorado capitalists and
the real development work has hardly
begun.
The mines are believed to be fully as
promising low-erado properties as. the
famous Golden Cross group at Hedges, in
this county, where 140 stamps are kept
pounding night and day.

ery. The son was sent to Whittier to-day.

Democratic State Central
Committee Levies an
Assessment.
Insane Asylum Employes Forced
to Add to the Campaign
Exchequer.
THREE PER CENT OF SALARIES
The San Bernardino " Sun " Exposes a
Successful Method of
Coercion.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Oct. 19.â
The Daily Sun of this city will to-morrow
publish an expose of Democratic methods
in the management of the Highlands
asylum for the insane that will create a
sensation throughout the State. It is
nothing less that an assessment by the
Democratic State Central Committee of 3
per cent on the annual salaries of eacli and
every male officer and attache of the in
stitution, with one exception.
The monthly payroll is $2600, and for
the year $31,200. Three per cent on this
is $936. and that sum was last week as
sessed, collected and forwarded to the
State Democrtic Committee.
Republicans, Democrats and Populist?
shared alike. The assessment was
couched in diplomatic terms, but con
tained a plainly implied threat that a re
fusal to^nake prompt payment would be
followed by a prompt loss of position or
place. Dr. Campbell, the medical director,
is a Republican. His salary is $3500 per
annum, and he paid $105. All others paid
a like percentage.
Harry Patton, one of the newly ap
pointed Democratic asylum directors, is
understood to have had charge of the as
sessment for the Democratic State Central
Committee.
The one exception noted is explained by
the fact that it is well understood that the
head of that official will drop into the
basket at an early meeting of the asylum
board, hence his escape from an assess
ment.
From the opening of the asylum in 1893
up to last month a majority of the board
was composed of Republicans. No assess
ment was ever made on any official
or attache of the asylum prior to
the 'advent of Governor Budd's Demo
cratic trustees, and an additional
fact is that In the employment of officers,
attendants and all classes of help the Re
publican asylum board never let the
question of politics enter into its councils
or selections. The only questions were
fitness and competency for the positions.
The result was that the present corps of
officers and attendants is composed of
Republicans, Democrats and Populists.
It is now well understood that the new
Democratic board will proceed to *'weed
out" all Republicans. This will be done
as rapidly as circumstances will permit.;
HARRIS AT LOS ANGELES.
Honest Money Audience Addressed by
the Democratic Orator.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 19.â Will A.
Harris, an able lawyer and an eloquent
speaker, for many years one of the fore
most advocates of the cause of the Demo
cratic party of Southern California, made
a great speech at Hazard's Pavilion here
this evening. The meeting was held un
der the auspices of the Business Men's
Sound Money Club. L. W. Blinn, an old
line Democrat, presided, and before intro
ducing the orator of the evening made a
few telling remarks explaining why he,
for the first time in his life, finds it in
consistent to support the so-called candi
date of his party, the "Boy Orator."
Harris, on rising to speak, was given an
ovation. In his preliminary remarks
one De La Veaux arose to dispute some
assertion relating to a challenge to Harris
by the so-called Silver Republican Club of
Los Angeles, when the speaker promptly
called him down, designating him as a
foreign anarchist. The remarks produced
considerable feeling and cries rang through
the pavilion to "Put him out, put him
out," but Harris insisted that the man â
anarchist though he was and born in a
foreign country â should be permitted to
remain. But upon further disturbance
he was ejected from the hall amid much
confusion.
Harris gave a cheerful report of tbe
meetings which he had addressed in dif
ferent parts of Southern California. The
speaker said that many of these meetings
in fayer of McKinley and sound money
had been presided over by silver-haired
Democrats, two of whom had voted for
Jackson. Respecting the challenge from
tne so-called Silver Republican Club, Har
ris said he never would pay any attention
to a banter emanating from any body of
people who were ashamed to confess their
identity to the world. Time and again
these gentlemen had been asked to declare
themselves and publish the names of their
members, but had Steadfastly refused to
do so.
The s peaker turned his attention to the
recent utterances of Governor Altgeld in
New York. The assault upon the integrity
of the Supreme Conrt of the United States
by the Illinois Governor was held up to
ridicule. Passing to tbe money question,
the speaker exhibited a silver dollar
which contained the required amount of
coin to be actually worth $1, the enormous
size of which produced loud laughter and
applause.
Charles A. Bariow's aspirations were re
ferred to, and his recent words of disre
spect toward Major McKinley were char
acterized as infamous. Barlow had said
that above a picture of McKinley should
be placed the union jack.

SELMAITES BEAR SHORT.
The Fresno Orator Defend* Ris Record
on the Money Question.
SELMA, Cal., Oct. 19.â Frank H. Short
of Fresno spoke here to-night. Ex-Sena
tor G. G. Goucher and George E. Church,
the latter the fusion candidate for Superior
Judge, in recent speeches here called Mr.
Short to an acconnt of his silver record.
Mr. Short to-night answered these stric
tures. He declared that the Republican
party was and ever had been the con
sistent friend of bimetallism, but had no
love for silver monometallism.
"Why is it," asked he, "that the Demo
cratic party is trying so hard to prove that
it is right by "the Republican record?
Has it no record of its own?"
Captain Frank Barrett, a life-long Dem
ocrat, made a brief address, stating that,
though not a Republican, he should vote
for the only sound-money candidate who
stood any chance of election, and, as the
President must not be without support in
the subordinate branches of the Govern
ment, he should also vote for Congress
man Bowers and for W. F. Rowell, Re
publican candidate tor the Assembly, who
would support Senator Perkins. Captain
Barrett appealed to the people to consider
that just now, when things were looKing
brighter, when for the first time in years
they were getting twice as much for their
raisins, their grapes and their wheat, not
to commit a suicidal act and destroy all
by the destruction of confidence.

tention to the fact that tbe silver conven
tion of a number of months ago contained

Guy Phelps, MT M. Esteeand other promi
nent Republicans, and then arraigned

SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 19.â When the

was formed in San Jose on August 6 no
particular importance was attached to it,
many believing that, like many others
formed before, it would in a short time
drop out of sight; but in a very short
time it showed the people that a crowd of
earnest Republicans were at the helm, and
from an insignificant beginning in two
short months it has developed into the
strongest political organization ever
formed in the valley. From twenty-five
to 800 members in that length of time is a
record to be proud of. It has conducted
an aggressive campaign and one that has
done much to insure this county to Mc-
Kinley and Hobart by at least 1200 to 1500
majority. The members of the league feel
proud of their work, and as a wind-up
they have enlisted the ladies, who formed
a Ladies' Republican League last Thurs

ARE YOU A BICICUSI?
If So, You Should' Not Fall to Profit by
' the Hints Given Below.
The discussions which have been going on
in the papers during the past months as to
whether bicycle riding is < a healthful recre-
ation naturally attract wide attention,. not
only from bicyclists themselves, but from their
vast army of friends, which includes nearly
everybody. â¢..â¢..
That a reaction does result from the vigor-
ous; often violent exercise in .which bicyclists
indulge, there can be no doubt, but it would
seem to rest almost entirely with the bicyclists
themselves, whether this reaction shall be a
healthful one or otherwise.
If men or women allow their tensified mus- â 
cles to relax too quickly it; ls Injurious. If
they permit the pores of the skin toclo*e too
suddenly it is certainly Injurious, often fataL
' There can be no doubt that a gentle stimu-
lant, both v internally and externally, meets
this requirement better than any other. A
small quantity of pure whiskey taken in a
little water, and a little undiluted whiskey
rubbed externally,' will counteract all possible
ill effects. In this day of adulterations it is
gratifying to know that so valuable an article
as Duffy's Pure Malt can be obtained so readily
and at such a reasonable price, and . the num.;
I>er of bicyclists which the writer has known
who are using it successfully indicates that,
they have found it of unquestionable value. : ;

NO CUT IN WAGES.
The Coast Seamen's Union Does Nut
Fear a Reduction in the
3len'g Pay.
A story was circulated the water
front yesterday to the effect that the ship
owners are about to make a cut of $2 50
and $5 a month in the sailors' wages. It
v.as caused, no doubt, by the attempt of
the captain of the coal bark Gatherer to
take out a mixed crew on Sunday. It
seems that John Cain offered to get a crew
for $22 50 to go on the Gatherer to Puget
Sound, the regular wage being %Ib. He
secured the first crew, but the latter,
learning of the reduction, went ashore
again. Another crew was obtained, but
with no better lasting success.
Finally he got together a number of
sailors known as the sidewalk brigade,
but it is belioved that even these were
promised regular wages. Another instance
of an attempt to reduce sailors' vases was
m.iUe on the schooner Charles Hansen.
The captain took two crew?, but tuey lef;,
refusing to go under regular wages, ana it
was not until the captain promised the
full rate, $30, that he was able to secure a
crew.
Secretary Furuseth of the Coast Sea
men's Union etatea that the union sailors
are treating the whole matter Â»s a joke
and even at the ireeting last evening the
matter was brought up only to be ridi
culed. He said that mis was the wrong
time of the year for shipowners to try to
reduce wages. The recent departnre of
the deep-water fleet "skinned the beach,"
so to speak, of all the men who would un
dertake long voyages.
Those who have been at work all sum
mer do not care to go to sea in the winter
time, even at $25 and $30. The cost of oil
skin garments and rubber-boots eat 9up all
oi the profits, and the sailors would rather
spend their time in town or on farms dur
ing the wet weather.

SYMBOLIC OF AMERICAN UNION
Thirteen H storic Trees PUnted in an
Arch to Typify tbe Original
States.
More than 2000 people assembled in
Golden (Jate Park on the site of the old
Forty-nine Mining Camp yesterday after
noon to witness the ceremony of planting
thirteen historic trees in a symbolic arch
by the members of Scqaoia Chapter,
Daughters of the American Revolution.
Under the direction of Superintendent Mc-
Laren trees from each of the thirteen
original States of the Union had been set
in the ground, and the ladies finished the
planting by depositing at each tree earth
from some historic spot.
Each tree was supported by a tall staff,
at the top of which was affixed an Ameri
can shield having across its face the name
of the State which the tree represented,
while from pole to pole, covering a space
GOO feet in width, were stretched many
streamers of various colors, while opposite
the tree representing Pennsylvania there
was a stand profusely decorated with the
National colors and American flags. This
stand was occupied by the members of fhe
chapter and others who were to take part
in the patriotic ceremonies. The First
Infantry United States band occupied a
position near the stand, while in front of
it stood the High School Cadets, Lloyd E.
Edwards captain commanding, number
ing seventy-four rank and file.
Alter the band iiad played a National
air two American flags were unfurled, and
these were saluted by the cadets in a man
ner that drew forth loud plaudits from the
spectators. The Right Rev. \Y. F. Nich
ols 1 , Bishop of California, offered up a
prayer, fervent and full of patriotism.
Then Mrs. Henry Wetlierbee said:
The exercises for which we are assembled
are presumably understood by all who have
honored us with their presence, and I will
simply state that the idea of thU tree-plant
ing, which shall represent the thirteen orig
inal States, was the outcome of the planting of
a sequoia tree by Sequoia Chapter In this park
April 19, 1894, and was suggested to Mrs. A.
B. Hnbbani, our registrar, by Mrs. P. J.
Hughes of Pennsylvania. Therefore, on be
half ol Hequoia Chapter, the original and
mother ennpter of this City and State, I bid
you welcome. California has always a large
welcome for all that is good, lor everything
that strengthens the bond between her and
her older sister States. Those trees shall grow
and thrfve under our fostering care and in our
genial sunshine, until some nay perhaps they
may rench a fuller development even than
were possible in their native soil.
;') Miss Hattie Vance Maitin, in a very
effective ; style, recited ; "Under the: Stars
and Stripes," an original poem by Abbie
Martin Blabon, in which the writer with
a great deal of force described the heroes
of the 1 ; Rebellion in their struggles for
liberty, then ! devoted a few Jines to
each of the trees donated for the historic
arch. The closi.ig lines of the poem are:

heart with rapture thrills;

Dnring the delivery and while Miss
Martin was addressing the flag, the sun,
which bad been nid by the focr, broke
through the mist and lighted up the scene
to the close of the poem.
Zenas U. Dodce delivered the oration,
which was a masterly effort and was fre
quently applauded. He paid a hieh
tribute to the ladies who were prompted
to observe the one hundred and fifteenth
anniversary of the surrender of Cornwallis
by the planting of trees in a historic arch.
Mons. Marais, representing tbe French
Consul, who was unavoidably absent, in
company with \Villiam Alvord, preceded
1 by a rile of cadets, marched to the Penn
i sylvania tree and there mixed with the
soil earth taken from the grave of tbe Mar
-1 quisde Lafayette in the cemetery at Picics,
France, ana members of the chapter pro
ceeded toother trees where they deposited
earth from historic spot", the band the
meanwhile playing La Marsellaise.
Mrs. Frank J. French read a poem which
she had written, a portion of which was
a reply to Gertrude Atherton's attack on
California manhood, this being loudly
applauded. The lines are:
That tlio Htaiu on our Western manhood
'] hat a womnn's pen Ims laid
Mum ii by woman's voice be answered.
Prior to*the planting of a scion of the
historic charter oak by Mrs. Helen A.
Hallowell, registrar, and Herbert R.
Baker, color bearer of Valentine Holt
Society, Children of the American Revolu
tion, Miss Hallowell said:
This little tree is the product of an acorn
gruwu upon the famous oak, that historical
tree of Hartford, i:i a cavity of which was con
cealed the charter of the colony of Connecti
cut granted la 1087 by Charles II of England,
the surrender of which James II later de
manded through Sir Edward Aniiros, Gover
nor. Even nt that time the ancient oak had
withstood the tempest for a century and it
suivlved until just forty years ago. It is with
patriotic pride that I present it. for that pur
pose, from the Valentine Holt Society of the
Children of the American Revolution, an or
ganization lormeit to perpetuate and keep
nlive the memories and deeds of oar sires of a
century and a quarter ago, and to inspire in
the young feelings of reverence forthoso noble
heroes who with their blood and toil laid the
foundation 01 this glorious nation.
The little speaker supplemented her ad
dress with an ode to the Stars and Stripe?.
The singing of "America" by all present
and the pronouncing of the benediction
by Rev. George E. Walk brought the ex
ercises to a close.
Fell From a IIÂ»y Loft.
Adam Zimmerman, who is employed nt the
Richmond Dairy, on I'oint Lobos road, met
with a serious accident yesterday morning.
About G o'clock he was in the loft of tho barn
throwing hay down, when he missed his foot
ing and fell to the ground, a distance of about
fourteen feet. He wa3 discovered nbout an
hour later in an unconscious and
taken to the Receiving Hospital. There it was
found that he hnd sustained a rupture of the
trachea, his lips were cut, hi? scalp wouuded
and his skull possibly fractured.
Woman Suffrage Benefit.

people from the various theaters will appear.
Manager George Lask of the Tivoii has assisted
the ladies in securing the talent, and much of
the suc:css of the entertainment will be due
to him.
ARE STILL ON STRIKE.
The City Newsboys Held a
Street Mass-Meeting Last
Evening.
" Happy " Dougherty, the Orator of
the Strikers, Discusses the
Situation.
The newsboys are staying J with the
strike. Not a youngster of the craft will
touch a Post, Bulletin or Report, and the
sight of one on the street in tne hands of
a subscriber will start a small riot. They
are much encouraged by the report tnat
the Journal of Commerce will come out
as an evening paper 10-day and that its
publishers will â ] start the ~ check": system
again. C The boys all over r the City con
tinue to handle the Oakland Tribune, sell
ing a large number of copies during ( eacli
afternoon.
Last evening a crowd of the boys, under
the leadership of the redoubtable 'Happy"
Dougherty, marched from the ferry up
Market street; to Grant avenue with their
rude but eloquent banners and mottoes, j
calling upon tne public to boycott the ob- !
jectionabje papers. ;\ "
- Eu Wagner, an ex-newsboy, mounted a
dry-goods box and .addressed tue large
audience, explaining the grievance of the
boys and requesting the citizens to with
draw their patronage from the evening
journals. : '
â  Judge Campbell was exDected to have

been present and speak In behalf of the
youngsters and their fijiht, and as the
popular police jurist failed to come into
court, *Happy" Dougherty lifted his
sma'J form on the rostrum and appointed
himself the Judge's substitute.
He said that three local evening papers
were trying to get ahead of the boys, and
he told in language, forcible if not ele
gant, his opinion of each one. When he
had finished the boys around the stand
howled an affirmative answer.
The enthusiastic little fellows gave three
rousing cheers for the orator and the
causa and quietly dispersed, expressing
their determination to "stay wid de
strike," even if doughnuts and coffee got
to be a tbing of the past.

The Kun* Chow Asylum Hesitates at
Patting Up $5000 to Prosecute
the Consul
The Chinese Consul-General, Fung Yung
Heng, has taken a new tack in his dealing
with the hatchet-wielders of the Chinese
quarter. They obtained a writ of injunc
tion in the Federal courts; now Heng,
acting under the advice of hi 3 attorneys,
has had twenty John Doe warrants sworn
out in the Police Court and placed in the
hands of his special officers.
Whenever a highbinder makes a dis
turbance or in any wise offers an excuse
for one of these warrants to be served on
him, he will be booked for vagrancy. By
this method it is believed the high
binders, being deprived of their leaders,
will grow discouraged and cease their
work of murder and blackmail.
The Sfee Yups have been holding some
pretty lively sessions lately and there has
been much pow-wowing over an excuse to
have both the Consul-General and Vice-
Consnl-General -, arrested and prosecuted.
They want the King Yung, the KungChow,
the Hop Wo and the Sue Hing companies
to put up bonds for $4XOO or $5000 each as
a guarantee of a fund to fight the Consul.
The treasury of the See Yup Company at
present is in a depleted condition.' â¢
Three of the companies have agreed to
this proposition. The Kung Chow was in
deliberation over the '. matter yesterday,
but reached no definite conclusion.
Last Saturday was the regular day for
the companies to pay to the treasurer of
the Six Companies the $4, fee imposed on
those Chinese who are thinking of .taking
a trip to the Flowery .Kingdom. The
Kung Chow f made no objection, but the
other three companies flatly refused to
put up their fee. They say they are tired
of paying money into the coffers of the
Six Companies, and are going to ; try to
break them up. '
Of the four pres'dents of the See Yup
Association i who went into hiding. last
Friday to escape the bullet or the knife

emblem :of the See Yup Association .still
floats triumphantly over their headquart

swear 1 y that yellow Hag and their wrecked
j apartments beneath that they will kill the
first person who enters ''for purposes, of

J waiting for a reply to his letter to Minister
Yang Yu at Washington/telling what has
been done and the difficulties encountered.

AGNEW AND HERGET
How the l'>stpni Fighter Gave Young
Mitchell's Brother the Double
Cross-
Gus Herget, a brother of Young
Mitchell, is now sorry that he was not in
condition lasl Friday evening when he
met and was defeated by Lon Agnew at
the Armory Club entertainment.
Agnew. according to report, agreed
with Herget that they should box ten
rounds and that it would end.in a draw,
after which fue purse would be divided.
In the interim Agnew held a consultation
I with some of his near advisers, who sug
gested that there would be some money
made in the pools if Agnew sailed into
Herget and whipped him in short order.
The result was that about $400 was bet at
Corbett's on Agnew wrapping Herget in
seven rounds or less. Judging from the
determined effort that Hercet made to
stand his ground and the ereat difficulty
the fighters met with in selecting a ref
eree on the night of the fijht the supposi
tion is that Agnew gave Herget the double
cross, or in otner words a run out.
However that may be, Young Mitchell
and his brother Herget seem very well
satisfied with the result, but it is whis
pered that Ilerget is looking for satisfac
tion and will take the first opportunity
tnat is offered to get even with Agnew and
his managers. Tne friends of Agnew con
tend that it is a poor wind that does noi
blow somebody good, but Herget is of the
opinion that he who lauuhs last laughs
best, and thus the matter stands at
present.
Whatever agreement the fighters made
it is a fact, nevertheless, that the public
was hoodwinked into believing that the
contest was to be "on the square."

Did He '
Catch You?
' "SAN JOSE, Cal., October 15.â A trav-
eling medicine fakir, with the sobriquet of
'Electric Bill,' did a good business in Santa
Clara : last' evening and victimized several
hundred people by selling a cheap Electric
Belt at a prorit of about 1000 per cent.
Before 'Electric Bill' becan the sale of his
wares he threw a handful of small silver
among his audience, and when he offered
his belts at $1 apiece there was a mad rush
for them. He then bought a number of
the belts back at 'several'times the price
I paid for them, and this caused: the more
' timid to invest. After be had disposed of
his entire stock he sang a song entitled
'Just Tell Them You Have Met Me and
They Wilt Know the Rest.' When the
fakir went to his hotel he was pursued by
a howling mob of his victim?, and. for a
time it looked as though 'Electric Bill*,
would be dragged from the hotel and made
to refund the money." â San' Francisco

, A cheap Electric Belt is like cheap jew-
elry. Some people will buy it because it
j is cheap, but after- trying it a few days
j they invariably lind that they have paid a
j high price for what they received.
* The only thing that makes it possible
for tneie fakirs to sell their cheap wares is
the fact that all thinking persons know
the real value contained in a genuine Elec-
tric Belt â one that will generate electric-
ity into the â just as every one knows
the value of a real diamond, and those
'. who do not take the trouble to investigate
are easily led into the belief that . the so-
called Electric Belt sold for $1 is the ' same
as the one ; costing $10 or $15. There is as
much difference as there is between a dia-
mond and a piece of glass. No belt gives
electricity unless it can be felt plainly as
soon as applied to the body, and no belt
! can be : made to generate electricity at a
' cost of $1. . :
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is the only
article on the market to-day that' is sold
on a positive guarantee to
( FORFEIT $5000
For one which will not give a current. of

as soon as applied to the body. .This cur-
rent is aho guaranteed to hold for one

; Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt is not cheap;
it cannot be made i cheaply and yet it is
within the reach of every one, while as-
suring the f most perfect appliance that
science can ' produce. It contains all
; known improvements, being perfectly in-
sulated and having a means of ' regulating

Belt made has this appliance. .-

Election November 3, J896.
Hear Boutelle to-n ght!
Now is the time for Republicans to
rally !
Let us show the man from Maine that
California is with him.
From this time on every citizen should
work for protection and prosperity.
The Popocrats started out with a hurrah
campaign, but are ending it with shrieks.
An ounce of protecion is better than a
pound of Bryanism in any American in
dustry.
It is about time indifferent citizens were
made to understand that the campaign
means business.
The campaign of the Bryanites is not
bo much an argument for free silver as an
appeal for revolution.
Don't be in any doubt of the result. The
way to be in at the victory is to follow the
Republican procession.
Bryan had better seek the center of the
country on election day or the tidal wave
will sweep him off the map.
Now that money is coming Into the
country for wheat, who is in favor of sell
ing the wheat for 50-cent dollars?
In Mexico, under the silver standard,
labor is about the cheapest thing in the
country. We do not wish that condition
here, do we?
However well Bryan's speeches may
sound they certainly do not read well and
there is a growing conviction that he is a
good deal more of an elocutionist than an
orator.
It was but a little while ago that the
Eastern people were compaining of hot
weather, and now the snowstorms have
begun. Life in that section seems to be
full of variety.
An instructive obje ct lesson for voters
is found in the fact that during the twenty
four months the Gorman tariff has been
in operation the- loss to the Government
has been $115 920.353.
No man in Congress has been an abler
or worthier champion of sound money
and protection than Mr. Boutelle of Maine
and no citizen should lose the opportunity
to hear him this evening.
What worfcingman will vote for free
trade and diminish his chance to earn
waces? What workingman will vote for
free silver and cut down the purchasing
power of the wages he earns?
The American people will not submit to
the cry of coercion any more than they
would submit to tut- thing itself. There
are some things that cannot be worked off
in this country, even in politics.
If the rise in prices knocks the founda
tion from under the Popocrat campaign
Mr. Bryan can at least say it was not his
fault. He has done all be could to dis
turb busine-s and keep prices down.
Some of the Popocrat organs nre object
ing to the use of the National flag in Re
publican processions; but really what
other symbol is there for National unity.
National prosperity and National honor?
Henry George has profited by the cam
paign to prove that he is a greater come
dian as a political prophet than he was as
a political economist, and that is some
thing in the way of getting a reputation
for versatility.
The prosperity now coming lo the coun
try can be made permanent by the estab
lishment of a protective system that will
keep the gold we are now importing in use
in American industries and the employ
ment of American laoor.
Bryan once declared himself in favor of
having the people taught Volapuk, but on
another occasion he voted against having
the English language taught in the pub
lic schools of New Mexico. That is the
kind of erratic genius he is.
A postal-cam ballot taken by the Chi
cago Record shows that in Chicago Mc-
Kinley will get over 80 per cent of the vote,
while in Illinois, outside of Chicago, he
wiliget7lper cent. The vote has been
fairly takers and is a sure indication of
how the election will go.
"The platform of the Chicaco conven
tion threatens to end with the destruction
of the social order, with lawlessness and
anarchy," says Archbishop Ireland; and
no one who has given heed to the ha
raiu ues of the Bryanite organs and
orators can doubt the truth of these words
of boiema warning addressed to the
people.
i
BALLY, REPUBLICANS!
The campaign has entered upon the
closing phase of the struggle. The people
have fairly aligned themselves on the
issues before them". None are now doubt
ful, except that wavering element whose
vote is always determined by the latest
influence brought to bear upon them. It
behooves the Republican party to be
active, earnest, vigorous and aggressive in
exerting its influence upon that element
cf the people in order that the victory now
fairly certain may be made doubly sure.
The appearance of the Hon. C. A. Bou
telle at Woodward's Pavilion this even
ing emphasizes for all Republicans the
beginning of this closing phase of tho
campaign. What he will have to say is
not necessary to the argument of the can
vass, for that has been fairly and fully
covered by our own orators. But the
coming of so distinguished a statesman
from the far off State of Maine to take
part in our canvass cannct fail to arouse
the enthusiasm of the party and add to
the force and effectiveness with which
every individual Republican will here
after work for the success of the great
cause of protection and prosperity.
To carry California for McKinley and
Hobart there is needed only the harmoni
ous and united efforts of the Republicans
of San Francisco. From all that can be
gathered the interior of the State will give
a majority for McKinley, but this may be
small, and it depends upon the vote of San
Francisco to make the State sure. No man
is better fitted to rouse the Republicans of
this City to the importance of the issue
and stimulate them to a new zeal in the
canvass than is this gifted orator and dis
tinguished statesman who comes to us
from tha extreme east of our common
country.
Hear Mr. Boutelle this evening! Don't
miss the opportunity to listen to one of
the most eminent statesmen of the day.
Don't lose the chance to have your own
opinions confirmed by the arguments of a
profound master of American politics.
He comes to you to speak ior the interests
of California as well as for those of Maine.
He will give you new reasons for the faith
that is in you of Republican success. He
will infuse you with 'that ardor which is
alone needed to make our California a
worthy sister of Maine in this contest for
the prosperity of the peopie and the honor
of the Nation.
We have been for three years suffering
from an Industrial depression greater
than ever before. For fourteen yearn,
from '78 to '92, under a gold standard,
our country has prospered as never be
fore. Wages had advanced. The coun
try every year sustained In comfort an
increasing population, and the output
of our farms and our lactories mv.de us
the industrial leader of the world. The
blight which came upon us, from my
point of view, was first the threat and
limited execution of free trade, and ext,
and still worse, the assault upon confi
dence by the action of Mr. Bryan's
party in holdi ig up the Government
and refusing supplies, preventing it s
having adequate revenue and tamper
ing with the currency.â Chauncey De
pew.
WHEAT AND SILVER.
There was once a stump-speaker address
ing an audience from a platform which
had been hastily constructed and one of
the planks of which bad not been nailod
down. When the course of his argument
had reached the climax he strode forward
to the edge of the platform to give the
vigor of action to tiia words, and, swelling
to his fullest size, shouted: "On this
point, ray fellow-countrymen, I teke this
position!" At that moment he stepped
on the loose plank of the platform, which
tilting up, sent him heels over head
sprawling to the ground.
The Bryanite orators and organs have
all had a mishap equally ridiculous. A
favorite plank in the platform of their ar
guments has been the close relation be
tween the price of wheat and the price of
silver. It was the demonetization of sil
ver which, according to their repeated as
sertions, forced down the price oi wheat
and ruined the farmers. Unfortunately
for the vociferous shouters this plank was
not fastened down by facts. Wheat has
suddenly tilted ud and the position of the
Bryanitos on the subject is that of a man
who has slipped suddenly from a teeter
board and fallen promiscuously all over
himself.
The price of wheat ha 3 been rising by
leans and bound- 1 , while silver so far from
rising has a downward tendency. Where
now are all the arguments of the Bryan
ites? Of what use are all the carefully
compiled and widely circulated campaign
documents which were intended for the
farmer's special edification? It is too late
in the campaign to invent new arguments,
too late to publish new documents. The
old statements must still be asserted,
altnough they have become the laughine
stock of the country, and the country will
have all the more amusement out of them
since prosperity is at band and laughing
is in order.
Bismarck, in 1871, demonetized silver
in Germany and established the cold
standard. It left Germany with 300,
--000,000 of *ilver in the treasury, which,
on account of the fall in thÂ« price of the
metal, she has been unable to dispose of.
So Bismarck says, as experience has
often said to credulity before, to this
callow youth of tha Platte : "Of course,
your great country can try the free coin
age of silver, and tho world will look on
with eagerness for the result of your
experiment." And then the grand old
statesman quietly sends word to the Ger
man Treasurer: "!5o sure you get our
silver into the United States mints first."
â Chauncey Depew.
AN APPEAL FOR REVOLUTION.
The Bryanite orators and organs have
well nigh abandoned the argument for
free .silver. They have raised the cry of
coercion and intimidation. They have
entered upon a campaign directed to the
sole cud of exciting labor against capital.
They have ceased to deal in vague gener
alities and in not a few cases have made a
local application to their appeals by en
deavoring to arouse the workingmen of
their own cities against the employers who
give them wort.
A recent example of this is to be found
in the attempt of the San Francisco Exam
iner to excite the animosities of the em
ploye? of the Union Iron Works against
the men who employ them. In this in
stance the appeal was harmless in San
Francisco, but it is sure to be copied far
a na wide in the East and may affect the
minds of people there. Eastern organs
will probably make similar attacks and
those will be copied here, and so this
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1896.
devil's interchange will go on and one lie
will be used to bolster up another unti
the minds of easily excited persons
already disturbed by the heat of the cam
paign may be rendered capable of almost
any kind of riot and mischief.
Mr. Bryan himself is not guiltless in
this appeal for revolution. He has led
his followers in tnis mad cry of coercion
and intimidation. He has done what he
could by every art of rhetoric and oratory
known to him to arouse jassions, prej
udices anrt envies in this country. For
tunately for the Nation, the time before
the election is short and there is little
danger that any great evil may be
wrought by these appeals, but none the
less must they be marked and noted.
Enough had been said and done to show
what the Bryanites aim at, and to give a
fair warning to ihe people of what would
result from the success of such a party at
the polls. In the face of that warning,
business men of all parties, industrious
men of every class and all the property
owning elements of the people can hardly
fail to combine to crush out once and for
all this pernicious force in our politics.
The success of Bryan would mean some
thing more than free silver and free
trade. It would mean freedom for law
lessness and riot, and it is not altogether
a campaign exaggeration to say that the
end of it would be the beginning of an
archy.
A LOCAL LESSON.
"To all our productsâ to those of the
mines and the fields as well as to those of
the shop and the factory, to hemp, to
wool, the product of the great imhistry of
sheep husbandry as well as to the fin
ished woolens of the mills, we promise
most ample protection."
It is in these words that the Republican
National platform of 1896 guarantees to
the American people that protection
which is essential to the welfare of the
farmer as well as to the manufacturer.
How necessary such protection is the ex
perience of the last three years has taught
the people. Every industry has learned
the lesson, but none so thoroughly as
those industries whose products were by
the Wilson tariff placed upon the free list.
The wool industry, to which in a special
sense the pledge of protection is given, is
one of the most important in California.
It has suffered severely Irom Democratic
legislation because it is one of the indus
tries ou which Democracy lias made a
complete experiment with free trade. Be
tween 1890, when the McKinley tariff took
effect, and 1895, when the Democratic tariff
became a force, the price of wool declined
nearly 50 per cent. J^'ine wool, which
brought 33 cents per pound in 1890, brought
only 17% cents in January, 1895. Wools
of coarser grades fell in like prop rtion,
and sheep-growers, who had been in pros
perous circumstances before.were reduced
to enforced economy in all cases and in
many to absolute destitution and ruin.
In this case there can be no question
that the fall of the price in wool was due
solely to a repeal of the protective tariff.
The wool-grower has learned his les on
and knows how to apply it in the coming
election. Other farm industries have suf
fered less severely only because upon them,
the Democratic free-trade principle was
not carried out to its full extent If Mr.
Bryan should be elected, however, thpre
is every reason to believe that t ese in
dustries like wool would be deprived of
any protection whatever. Of that there
can be little question. Mr. Bryan is an
extreme free-trader. He declared the
Wilson tariff imposed duties too high to
suit him. He has never recanted that
doctrine. He is one of the free-traders to
whom the disasters of the past years have
taught nothing. To elect him to office
would be for the farmer a virtual destruc
tion of the industry by which he lives.
The platform of the Chicago conven
tion threatens to end with destruction
of social order, with lawlessness and
anarchy. The personification of law
and of aoclal order in America is in our
court*, and the promise of safety to
our free institutions is the prompt
obedience to those courts, and now the
courts are to be shorn of their power,
and shorn of it in favor of mobs bent on
rioting and the destruction of prop
erty.âArchbishop Ireland.
TEE AMERICAN PLAG.
That the action of Chairman Hannain
suggesting that the American flag be
displayed upon a certain day at the
hemes and places of business of all
those who intend to vote for McKinley
is regarded by the Bryanites as a most
dangerous as well as skillful bit of politi
cal taciics is made evident by the action
of Chairman Jones of Arkansas, who last
eveninc issued an appeal to all persons
who favor the election of Bryan to make a
like display at similar places and at the
same time. The purpose of such an ap
peal on the part of the chairman of the
Democratic National Committee is evi
dently to nullify the effect cf Mr. Hanna's
suggestion, and is born of the fear that its
adoption by those who intend to vote for
MtKmley upon the 3d (Jay of November
would decide the election tiome days in
advance of its occurrence.
In spite, however, of the swift criticism
which the Pop- cratic press ha 3 flung at
Mr. Hanna by reason of his suggestion
and of Chairman Jones' speedy effort at
its nullification, the idea is one which Mr.
flaniia was w se in suggesting and which
the Republican party had a right to adopt.
It is to be remembered that in the darkest
and most doubtiul days of our Nation's
history the Republican party nailed the
American flaj: to the masthead as its em
blem not only of American honor, but
also of American unity, and that from
t bat time until now that party, in a pe
culiar sense, has had the light to prece
dence in claiming the American flag as its
emblem and as the insignia of its loyalty
to those ideas which preserved the honor
and the unity of our Nation.
It is also to be remembered that there
have been times when a large proportion
of the Democratic party strongly in
clined to float another flag and that
among the States which evinced this in
clination in its most offensive form was
that from which the present chairman of
the Democratic National Committee hails'.
Ihe action of Chairman Jones, therefore,
comes with rather bad grace, under the
circumstances, and clearly indicates that
it had its conception not in any special
devotion to the American flag but rather
in a disingenuous, and aliogether un
worthy attempt to nuliify the dangerous
effect of Mr. Henna's suggestion. It
savors of that sort of politics which prides
itself upon its astuteness in stealing the
tore es with -which a rival party expects
to illuminate its procession.
It would have been much more credita
ble to Chairman Jones' sense of proper
campaign tnctica to have provided for a
similar demonstration, but upon a differ
ent day. The fact that he has chosen the
same day shows clearly that he did not
dare to select another, because he knew
better than he has courage enough to
state that the adoption of Chairman
Hanna's suggestion, without interference,
would show that a large majority of the
I American people associate the American
flag with the Republican party, and would
display the one gladly and proudly as a
conclusive evidence that they intend to
support the other.

THE MINTS AND THE MILLS.
New York Treat.
The mills ol this country cannot open until
we restore to the American people their own
market. We cannot restore to them thfs mar
ket by opening our mints to silver, to gold or
to anything else. When we restrict the im
portations of foreign goods with a tariff that
will permit Americans to manufacture prod
ucts that can be soM in this country, Ameri
can wage-earners will find employment as
they found it in 1892 and will again receive
the wages which they received in thatytar,
bat if we had a mint for every mill In the
Uniied States and still allowed foreign goods
to come unobstructed into our market, tne
American wage-earner would still seek for
work in vain and would still find that there
were no dollars for him, no matter how many
of them were coined and no matter what tho
va'ue of them.
Letters From the People*
THE CITY POPULISTS*
Are They "Bunkoed" and "Swallowed
â  ''â ' Up " by the' Democracy
To the Editor of the San Francisco Call -Sib:
For me to remain silent at | this | time as to the
charges made by all : the dally newspapers of
San Francisco '. that the Populists * have ; been
"bunkoed" ana ."swallowed' up" by the City
Democracy, or either wing of ; it, would \ indi
cate that I wished to dodge â¢ these charges or
that the evidence to ; support them is so con
clusive that I deem it ; prudent not to say a
word about it. .
The old-line Populists of San Francisco, those
who used to be able to muster all the way
from twelve to eighteen men, one of whom,
was the writer of this letter, to meet in coun
cil once a week in this great City, and to pay
the hall rent at great self-sacrifice, for more
than a year, for the sole purpose of trying to
form the nucleus of the People's part , seem
to be less concerned than anybody else in the
City over the dreadful fate which, if we are to
believe the unfriendly newspaper*, has over
taken the party in the present campaign, if
these old-line City Populists and their older
coworkers of the last lour years were inclined
to grieve over their present deplorable situa
tion, as the newspapers picture it, their lacer
ated susceptiDilities might find somewhat of
soothing balm In the generous recognition,
delayed though it be for about six years, of
their sturdy virtues as citizens above the
reach of the evil boss Influences which have
ruled both old parties in this City lor many
years.
To these old-line Populists it seems a singu
lar circumstance that they were regarded by
these same newspapers as political lunatics
not worth noticing, except now and then
when there appeared to be a chance to poke
fun at them, but who are now credited with
having possessed great civic virtues while
they cut no figure In politics, and are char jed
with having suddenly losi all these virtues
the moment they appear likely, by an honor
able union with free-silver allies, to be able to
dt- feat the boss-nominated candidates of their
political opponents, who are striving to main
tain the present gold standard till other na
tions, which favor tne gold standard, consent
to adopt international bimetallism.
Suppose, however, that these City Populists
had taken tue advice of their political ene
mies and had nominated only good "middle
of-the-road" straight Populists lor municipal
officers and refused to form any alliance with
the free sliver ana Bryan iorces of the City in
the face of the powerful and all-pervasive
sentiment in favor of a union of the reform
and silver forces which has taken form in the
united support of Bryan ail over the Nation,
and of Congressmen and St-ue legislators in
nearly every State of the Union, would not
these City Populists have justly earned the
title of political lunatics? Would not this be
tne more emphatical.y true when it is remem
bered that Populists regard the present politi
cal struggle as fraught with great peril to the
plain people of our country?
Time aioue can prove the wisdom or the
folly of the alliance mad,! by the Populists
with the free-silver Republicans and free-.~ilwr
Democrats Id the support of Bryan for the
Presidency, and in like alliance with the same
free-silver forces to secure the election of Con
gressmen aud State Legislatures where United
States Senators are to be elected that will sus
tain Bryan's administration, but present indi
cations as to the political situation stem to
un\.rd ample justification lor these- alliances,
and but lew of the strictest Populists now
doubt the wisdom of the course adopted by
their party. Now, as m. nopoiies rule San
Francisco and City politics in tuis Presiden
tial year, with the two o.d parties hoplessly
divided into opposing .actions, witn the Non-
Parnsans in the fielu, Populists believed tnat
thi- opportunity had come to invite the honest
anti-monopoly and silver forces on a sixth
ticket and by nominating unimpeachable and
capable men on a purely Popuiistic municipal
platform they would have a fair chance to
elect these men on such a platform, these nom
inations to be mftde in a true and honest
non-partisan or above-partisan spirit.
When the People's party municipal conven
tion met the writer of this letter wrote out
resolutions proposing such au alliance with
the anti-monopoly and stiver forces of this
City, and providing for a committee of six on
conierence on candidates, and these resolu
tions were adopted by the municipal conven
tion by an almost unanimous vote, and the
committee was duiy appointed. This com
mittee whs made up of old and tried Populists
who had and still have the confidence and
respect of the Populists ot this City. 1 was
honored witn a place oa that committee aud
know that overtures were at onco made to the
Non-Partisans and the Junta Democrats, and
several informal conferences were held with
prominent aud active memborsof both of these
organizations. Indeed, several days were lost
in this way, as these Non-Parusaus and Junta
Democrats finally ignored our overtures and
failed to m?et us even informally. In the
meantime, overtures came to us from the ot:ier
Democratic organization which had openly
declared lor Bryan and free silver, our natural
allies in the present political contest. The
good Non-Partisans and the "respectable"
Junta Democrats, evidently under the gold
standard influence, declined any alliance with
Populists to secure good government lor ibe
City of San Francisco, and Boss Ellert nomi
nated his ticket and uamed it Non-Partisan,
while Boss Rainey nominated his ticket and
namea it Regular Democratic
In the ineant.mj the ignored Popu Ists,
braving the wratn of the virtuous and un
biased newspapers, met with honorable over
tures from the silver and Bryan D-mocrats,
and these overtures were made by men In
stead of the hnlf-human opers pictured by the
newspapers. Tne wiry Popu. Ists dictated the
terms of an agreement which is now revealed
to the public in the ticket nominated by their
party, and which Was published in the news
papers of SundÃV, October 13. The natuie of
that agreement is at once seen in the fact that
ourcandidates are not confined to the nomi
nees of any one convention or political organ i
zntion. Indeed, the full extent and exact
character ot that agreement will be better un
derstood when a thorough and careful exami
nation of the ticket Is made, and the Â»â  aiuling
and character of each candidate hay* received
the closest scrutiny. But that is not all.
These candidates all s'.aud on our municipal
platform pledged to our principles as applied
to municipal government, whi c their first
pledge was the support of Bryan and lree
silver.
After three weeks of conscientious work on
the committee in investigating candidates and
in a ding to nominate cood men on our ticket
I am willing to go on record In this City and
all over the State of California in the columns
of The Call as saying without reservation
that our Poju.ist ticket contains the names of
at least nine candidates for Supervisors who
will be "solid" f r the City, and Jisjainst any
corpornte inflneiic?, no matter what tempta
tions may be urged upon their Consideration.
I have, indeed, no apologies to make lor the
Populist municipal ticket taken as a whole
but Â«m proud of it. Joseph asbuky Johnson.

IS IT A BAD THING?
Boston Journal.
In one of bis lowa speeches Mr. Bryan said:
"The gold standard means that the dol.ar will
buy more ana more all the time." This he
urged as one of the most serious indictments
against the existing system. . __
But is ': really a bad thing that the dollar
buys more now than it did ten, fifteen, twenty
years ago? That is a question which deserves
the serious consideration of wage-earners and
all people of limited means. The dollar
against which Mr. Bryan brings this indict
ment of buylDg more than it ought is the dol
lar in which wages are paid: it is the dollar
which the pensioner receives; it is the do lar
which is paid to the savings bank depositor
when he withdraws auy part of his deposit.
Mr. Bryan insists that it ought not to go so lar
as it does in buying the necessaries and com
forts ot life. Is he right?
In making this statement, Mr. Bryan un
covers the real object of his championship of
free silver. That object is to introduce a dol
lar which will buy less than the dollar now In
circulation. It is clear that this is what he
has in mind, or otherwise his denunciation of
the gold standard dollar for buying too much
has no meaning at all.
It has been charged by the defenders of
sound money in this campaign that the result
of the triumph of free silver would be to cut
the purchasing power of the dollar in which
wages are paid in two. In the words which
we have quoted Mr. Bryan virtually admits
this.
He does not, indeed, indicate whether the
purchasing capacity of the dollar should be
reduced by one-half or by some smaller frac
tion, but that it ought to be reduced he clearly
affirms when he says that at present its pur
chasing capacity is greater than it should be.
Put in plain English, therefore, Mr. Bryan's
procramme for the wage-earners of this coun
try is that they should vote for a voluntary
reduction of their wages by means of a reduc
tion of the purchasing power of the money in
which their wages are paid. To suppose that
any considerable number of them would ac
cept such a programme as that is to suppose
that they have gone clean daft.
QUOTATIONS FROM LINCOLN.
New York Advertiser.
It is well that the Popocratic speakers should
qaote liberally from the addresses and letters
of Abraham Lincoln. The martyr President
was himself of the people and a believer In
popular government But there is no reason
why "quotations" which are bogus should be
used to bolster up a dishonest cause. Such
denial we have to-day from Lincoln's secre
tary and the author of his "Liie," John G.
Nicolay, declaring as spurious this extract,
largely made use of by Popocratlc speakers;
"Mr. Lincoln said: 'As result of the war,
corporations have been enthroned, and an era
of corruption in high places will follow, and
the money power oi the country will endeavor
to prolong its reign by working upon the pre
juu ices of the people until all the wealth is
aggregated in a few hands and the Republic Is
destroyed. I (eel at this moment more anxiety
for the safety of my country than ever before,
eveu in the midst of war. God grant that my
suspicions may prove groundless.' "
Mr. Nicolay says that Mr. Lincoln never ut
tered n word here attributed to him.
"This allege*! quotation from Mr. Lincoln is
a bald, unblushing forgery. The great Presi
dent Dever said it or wrote it, and never said
or wrote anything that by the utmost license
could be distorted to resemble it."
This is not surprisn^. That the Popocrats
who believe in anarchy, repudiation and the
formation of the gigantic silver trust should
stoop to foi eery will be readily believed. But
not even forgery can be suoces-ful lor any
length of time lo brace up a dishonest cause.

Advices from Honolulu by the steamer
sta:e that there was a serious row on the
British ship Troop. The sailors attacked
the officers, and Second Mate Hanyey
fired three shots into the crowd. Sailor
Dzar was slightly wounded and the rest
ran. Hanvey was tried and acquitted.
The bark Gainsborough, which went on
Diamond Head on the morning of August
29, was taken off on the 4th inst. and was
towed into Honolulu harbor. The dam
ate was slight, and after temporary re
pairs have been made she will come to
San Francisco for a thorough overhaul
ins.
The Peru reports that the British bark
Ladas left Honolulu on the 9;h inst for
this port to loaa wheat for London.
The sealing schooner Josephine is re
ported with 148 skins. Captain Han-sen
also reports that late in June be spoke the
Diana with ten and the Retriever with six
otter skins.
The little schooner Mercur, built by
Turner for Wilkens & Co., is being fitted
out at Howard-street wharf. She is 70
feet long, 20 feet broad and 7 feet deep,
and will be used as a trader to tbe Marshall
Islands. The Mercur is a handsome little
craft and should prove to be a fast sailer.
A private letter gives the information
that ihe Sierra, Captain McWhinney, is
coming here from Cardiff. The jolly old
skipper has a host of admirers here, but
he will be disgusted when he learns that
bia bosom friend, Captain Cowper of the
Kinros->hire, is on his way to England
from Iquique and not to San Francisco.
"Has William been here yet?" was always
the first question asked by McWhinney,
and wben a negative answer was given ne
would say, "Well, I'll wait awhile, tbe oid
woman will be along in a few minutes."
Wben Cowper was first he would ask, "Has
Jim been here yet?" and when he got a
negative reply he would sit down and re
mark, "Well, the old man will be here in
a few minutes." They were always to
getber and are known everywhere aÂ»
Damon and Pythias.
Captain "Jim" Patterson of the Dan
staffnage is praying for a chance to come
to California. A couple of years ago he
was ordered to San Francisco and he did
nothing during tne entire trip but curse
bib ill luck. He had a pleasant time here
and sailed for Europe with a better
opinion of tbe people and the country.
He is now in Calcutta and writes to "Jim"
Boyes: "How I wish I was back in Cali
fornia. The heat and mosquitoes are some
thing awful and the climate is unbear
able. I take back ail I said about San
Francisco. It's a great place to live
in, and I'd give two months' pay
to have the old ship at anchor inside the
Golden Gate."
Quite a fleet got in last night. The
schooner Lizzie Prien, from Coquille
River; tbe bart Aureola, from the Sound;
the ship S. P. Hitchcock, from New York;
the Britis â  ship Manchester, frutu
Antwerp, and the British ship Eudora,
from Callao, were nil in the ofnmr at dusk,
while the tramp eteamer Wennington
Hall, from Shanghai, and the sbip Elen
Esslin, from Tallal, zot in early in the
day. Ail tbe liig ships are chartered to
load wheat and wili get quick di patch.
The bar buoy at CoquJle River has
gone adrift, so coasting captains will have
to look out. The steam schooner Farallon
is tied in-ide the bar and cannot get out,
and the steam schooner Alcazar is outside
waiting a chance to get in.
The schooner Mary and Florence got
foul of the cable yesterday. When the
flood tide came she dragged her anchor
and brought up on the telegraph line.
Assistant Chief Wharfinger Scott sent out
an order to move the boat at once, but the
order could not be obeyed. Twelve men
were at work up to dark trying to move
the boat, but failed. The schooner was in
a dangerous position and the captains of
the ferry-boats had to keep a bright look
out for her during the ni>;ht.
' J. Leask Ross, formerly of Morrison's
pnotograpbic studio â¢ of Chicago, spent
yesterday in Salt Lake en route to San
Francisco. Mr. Ross has an enviable
reputation as one of the finest expert pho

SUTRO'S GIFT MAY
LAPSE AFTER ALL
Mere Scandal About Pay
ing the Architect's
Commission.
Governor Budd Insists That the
Contractors Contribute
the Money.
THE MAYOR IS INDULGENT.
Time for Beginning Work oa the
Affiliated Colleges Is Again
Extended.
The Legislature two years ago appropri
ated $250,C00 to erect a building in San
Francisco for the Affiliated Colleges of the
State University. The Regents secured a
gift of land, a besntiful site, from Mayor
Sutro, on condition that active work of
construction should bsgin at a specified
time. When the time limit expired no
work had been done, owing to the delay
of the Regents in agreeing upon the plans
of architecture.
Mayor Sutro was asked to extend the
time. He created quite a scars at the
meeting of the board by an open declara
tion that there was a scheme to defeat the
enterprise. He agreed, however, to an
extension, and papers were accordingly
drawn. Other delays followed, and a few
days before October 8, the day for the ex
piration of tbe extended time limit, a
meeting was held in Regent Reinsieia's
office to effect the signing of contracts
under the award made by the board. Gov
ernor Budd did not attend this meeting,
as he was not notified wben it was called.
Subsequently he raised the point that the
approval of the contract by the Attorney-
General had not been given as requir d by
law, and therefore no valid contract had
been made.
Hearing of the Governor's opposition, the
building committee, of which J. West Mar
tin is chairman, suspended operations, and
the time under the Sutro extension expired.
A scene occurred at the meeting of the
Regents last Tuesday. The Governor and
Regent Martin addressed each other
sharply as "Sir" and each shook a finger
at the oilier. Incidentally the accusa
tion was laid that a waiver of $11,000
which the architect had made in his com
mission to bring the total cost within the
amount appropriated was to be made good
by the contractors. This so complicated
affairs that it was decided to have a joint
meeting of the law and building commit
tees in Judtre Wallace's chambers to ad
just the difficulties.
Accordingly these committees of the
Board of University Regents met Gov
ernor Budd and Mayor Sutro in Judge
Wallace's courtroom yesterday forenoon.
The conference was attended by Regents
J. West Martin, Arthur Rodgers, H. S.
Foote, J. B. Reinstein, together with At
torney Mhoon and Secretary Bonte of the
board.
Mayor Sutro, as an interested party,
waa present. He had been informed of
the complication, and had consented to
another extension until October 30. He
wa? at first inclined to declare a forfeiture
o. his gift. The explanation which Gov
ernor Budd made ot the new complication
which had just arisen did not seem to be
com pre trended by the Mayor. He said:
"I have made a proposition to do a gen
erous act, and ii the regents choose to re
ject the gilt let them do so. The public
may say that I have backed out, but I
know that I have acted in good faith."
Governor Budd replied that the work
bad been commenced in good faith by the
regents, but it had tran pired that the
contractors had aereed to pay certain com
missions of $11,000 waived by the archi
tect.
The Governor described the fine mate
rial that was to enter into the construc
tion of the building and declared that the
proposition to allow the work to proceed
under tne direction of an architect receiv
ing compensation fr#m the contractors
supplying the material could not be tol
erated. The Governor recalled many inci
dents of the early meetings to consider
the plans and mentioned that the archi
tect had given a bond that the cost would
not exceed $250,000, yet the bids did exceed
that sum, and in order to avoid a readver
tisement an arraneement had been effect
ed whereby the architect waived his com
mission.
Mayor Sutro said he did not understand
what this had to do with the conduct of
the regents in jeopardizing the gift which
he had made.
Judge Wallace explained to the Mayor
that the Regents could not permit their
architect tp be governed by the contract
ors.
The Mayor admitted the impropriety of
such control, and in view of the complica
lion would extend the time for beginning
work until October 30.
Architect Kroits was requested to make
a statement of the case. He acknowledged
that the bids were a trifle bicher than his
estimate*, but denied with a great deal of
emphasis that he was in the pay of the
contractors, or that he expected any com
pensation lrom that source. "When the
bids were found to exceed $250,000 some
way was suggested to reduce the figure
and to avoid the expense and delay of re
advertising. Attorney Mhoon was of the
opinion that modifications might be made.
Dr. Beverly Cole then announced that his
faculty would guarantee to the amount of
?15,000. ;i
Judge Wallace asked the architect If any
agreement had been made between the
contractors and the architect. Mr. Kroft
replied that none had been made.
Governor Budd â Have you heard that
the contractors are to pay Dr. Cole $10,000
to reimburse the faculty?
The architect replied that such an un
derstanding might have been on tbe basis
of using U'olsom granite. The architect
further explained that the reimbursement
of Dr. Cole was an arrangement of the
building committee to be brought about
by the use of Folsom granite.
In reply to Governor Budd the architect
said it was the supposition from the start
that Foisom eramie could be used.
Governor Budd â How did it happen
that Ray bid $45,000 for sandstone and
$43,000 for granite when the granite is the
more expen>ive material?
_The architect contended that the nse of
ro'som granite was authorized.
Governor Budd again asked the archi
tect tne direct question: "Do you know
that the contractors are to reimburse
Cole?"
The architect said he did not know it.
The regents decided to adjourn tne con
ference until 1:30 p. m. to-day and ask Dr.
Cole to attend.
In the diversions of discussion yester
day Mayor Sutro did not encounter the
octopus, but he launched out on the dan
gers of a bloody war if tbe rights of the
people were not respected.
/ The position of affairs, so far as the re
gents, are concerned, Is extremely tender.
Should someihine happen before 1:30 p. m.
to-day to cause Mayor Sutro to fly off tbe
handle the whole scheme for building on
the Sutro Bite may fall to pieces and the
appropriation of |2,0,000 lapse into the
treasury. Judge Wallace and Artnur
Kodgers seem to possess the confidence of
the Mayor and on their assurance that
everything possible is being done for the
good of the country he may remain tran
quil and indulgent.
TO HAVE HEADQUARTERS
The Federation of Women Has
Just Taken a Home of
Refuge.
Destitute We men end Children Will
Be Temporarily Taken
Care Of.
The Woman's Federation definitely de
cided yesterday to open a home of refuge
for women and children. For some time
past it had been the intention of this body
to open an emergency reluge, where des
titute women could find a temporary
abode, but it was not until yesterday that
the location was definitely decidad upon.
The home chosen for the headquarters is
1057 Golden Gate avenue. It has only six
rooms, but the ladies consider that it can
comfortably accommodate ten women and
that by crowding it will take in more.
The rent is only $14 a month, as the fed
eration prefers beginning in a smail way
and paying its bills as it goes instead of
launching out beyond its means.
Cots have already been promised for tbe
home, and otner furniture will probably
be donated. Mrs. Mary Trueworthy has
been elected matron. The reluge home
will formally open at the end of this week.
For some time past the Federation o!
Women has been petitioning the Board of
Health to appoint a woman physician to
the Receiving Hospital. Yesterday it was
resolved to renew the appeal, and ihe
following ladies were appointed a com
mittee on working to get a woman doctor
appointed at the Receiving Hospital : Mrs.
K. Oatman, Mrs. M. J. Payne and Mrs.
Richardson.
FOR BLYTHE'S MONEY
Former Guardian of the Capitalist's
Daughter Sued for
824,000. :
Suits were yesterday filed against Kate
C. Byrne and Florence Blythe Hinckley
and their husbands for $24,000, alleged to
be due on promissory notes signed by
Mrs. Byrne.
Mrs. Byrne was Mrs. Hinckley's guar
dian while the latter was a minor, and in
1872, in consideration of the care and at
tention bestowed on her by Mrs. Byrne,
the heiress of the Blythe millions agreed
to give her guardian 10 per cent of her
fortune. She has since been paying $500
per month on account of this coritract.
Alter the signing of the agreement
whereby Mrs. Byrne was to get her per
centage" of the Blythe estate, that lady
gave Ida J. Phillips a promissory note for
$20,000, for value received, and Levi Kovv
ai*ky a note for $4000. It is these iwo
persons who are suing Mrs. Byrne ana
becau c of the contract Mrs. Hinckiey and
her husband are parties to tbe suit.
Improvements at Paso Robles.
The new mud-bath house recently erected at
Paso Robles Is Infinitely superior to the old
one. It Is tightly sealed on the Inside, hence
retains all the natural heat generated by the
springs, and beins some six feet lower than
the old building it does away completely with
the stairs which were so inconvenient. *
Ejected by the Conductor.
Thomas Robinett has begun suit in the
Justice Courts apainst the Market-street Rail
nay Company for $299 damages. Ho alleges
that on October 19, 1895, he was put off an
Eddy-street car by the conductor after he had
paid hia fare, nnd that, in addition, unneces
sary violence was used in ejecting him.

WHEAT GETS INTO
LOCAL POLITICS
"The Call's 1 ' Cartoon Ad
mitted to Be a Strong
Argument.
California Democrats Have Little
to Say on the Silver
Side.
BKYAN'S PET THEORY FAILS.
Silver Does Not Control the Price of
Cereals, After Allâ Bimetallic
Opinion.
Democratic politicians are greatly per
turbed by the remarkable and from their
standpoint the entirely reprehensible posi
tion of Wheat in the present campaign.
Mr. Bryan nnd his adherents have been
counting on Wheat as one of their prime
supporters. Everywhere in Mr. Bryan's
highly advertised lecturing tour he has
tola the farmers to look out for their
wheat interests, assenting to the view that
the price of Wheat is almost exclusively
governed by the price of silver.
Other campaign orators took up the
hint and put the case a little stronger
than Mr. Bryan did, backing their asser
tions by the marvelous figures ol the cam
paign statistician.
Just as Wheat was being extolled as the
bulkwark of the Democratic party, and
consequently the palladium of American
liberty, what doe 3it do but desert the
Democrats, simultaneously throwing its
immense vote-controiling influence into
the balance for ihe Republican party.
The political cartoon in yesterday's
Call, representing Mr. Bryan's fright and
dis-comtiture at the apparition of Wheat
selling at $1 50 in gold, with silver still de
pressed, called forth favorable comment?
in every direction. Even the Democrats
were compelled to admit the strength and
cog-ncy of the argument.
Wben Republicans were asked for their
opinions they simply smiled and said:
"We have no need of an argument, tbe
situation speaks for itself and lor us.
There's the Wheat."
Gavin McNab and W. H. Alford, chair
man of the Democratic State Committee,
were asked if tbey had any explanation ot
the Wheat problem at this time. Botb
declined to tell their views for publica
tiou. Mr. Alford said: "There is a good
answer to be made to this Wheat proposi
tion, but it is not a subject that I would
care to discuss offhand, or to discuss at all
without sufficient time to give it the study
and attention which it deserves."
George W. Baker, one of the leaders of
the California Bimetnllic Leaeue, said:
"This sudden rise in Wheat cuts no figure
as against the argument presented by the
friends of free silver. It is due entirely to
causes that do not relate to the pr.ee or
silver or the price of anything else except
W T heat. These has been a failure of the
Wheat crop in India and our Wheat is be
ing shipped there to feed the starving mil
lions of that vast country."
A suggestion was interposed that no
definite information had been received
from India to the effect that there was a
wide-spread failure of the cereal crop.
"May be not," assented Mr. Baker.
'â¢Possibly the news has not been cabled to
this country, but it must be true, for if the
crop there were not a failure California
would not be shipping Wneat to Calcutta.
It would be like carrying coal to New
castle."
E. P. E. Troy of the Democratic State
Campaign Committee took a rosy view of
the situation. He thought the advance
in Wheat values is partly due to the wide
spread and deeply rooted belief of many
that Mr. Bryan is sure of election, and
that this is but discounting somewhat in
advance the rise that would inevitably
come not only to Wheat, but to all other
staple farm products as soon as remone
tization of silver is assured.
Mr. Troy confessed, however, that the
demand for Wheat from India, Australia
and England was the prime cause of the
present upward movement. "The re
moneiization of silver would be a power
ful factor in the advance in the price of
Wheat," said Mr. Troy, "but it is not the
only factor. We are tlad to see Wneat go
up, no matter what i 3 the cause. Just
wait till silver is remonetized, and you'll
see an additional boom that will do your
heart good."
In the meantime the Republicans are
making the best of the argument, and let
it be known that they are counting Wheat
in the Republican column.

Another big lot of explanations fell due
from William :J. Bryan yesterday. De
spite the constant dropping of the price of
; silver wheat went booming 'â  upward and
upward yesterdayâ a total rise of 9 cents
for the day.
The excitement was intense from open
ing to close. Only once did the price sag
and the bears get a chance for their
money. The news was encouraging to
the price from every point of the compass,
and all day reports from Chicago indi
cated the greatest excitement , prevailing
there on 'Change.
England kept buying in spite of the
rise, just as though she reeded wheat.
May option opened at $1 55% and under
the early morning enthusiasm ran up rap
idly to ;$1 58. Toward the 1 close of : the
first call, however, it fell back a notch or
two, stopping at $1 56%
i December began business at $1 55 and
held to that â  price through the session.
Something over 103,000 centals in both op
tions changed hands.
At 10:15 o'clock December opened three
points lower at $1 52, but rose to $1 54%,
declined again to $1 53% and closed at
$1 53%. " â 
â  â  May also was a shade lower at the open
ing, |154J^, jumped away up to $1 57%
and closeu at $1 56%.
At 11:15 o'clocK December began busi
ness at $1 54%, shortly- afterward dropped
the %, then took on % and at the close let
it go again.
May opened at $1 56%, rose and fell and
closed at $1 57%.
In the aiternoon the advance was
steadier, following advices from London
of advances there, and the excitement be
came intense. A net advance of 9 cents
marked the day.
; A number of bankers were interviewed
yesterday as to the effect of the rise on
the >i money market, Ââ¢ whether or not it
would loosen money with regard to wheat.
At the Bank of California the managers
stated that they had always been ready to
loan money to their customers on wheat
at a safe margin; that the rise would
make no particular difference.
At the Anglo-California Bank the state
ment was made that wheat at a low price

that the advance would make little differ*

The president of the Sather Banking
Company said that money was advanced
on wheat only on safe margins, a wider
margin being required now than before
the rise. He remarked that the rise in
wheat at this time could not be more op
portune, showing, as it does, the folly of
the argument that the price of silver
governed and kept pace with the price of
wheat. He thought ihat confidence was
returning to the business men of the

THE MYSTIC X UMBER NINE
Fancy of Ignatius Donnelly Employed
to Secure the Greatest
Secrecy.
A secret organization of medical men
lias been formed in San Trancisco, and it
is possible that it may exert considerable
influence. It is organized on the plan of
circles of nine, and each member is to be
known by a number and not by a name.
The purpose of the organization is to
mitigate or abate various abuses deroga
tory to the interests of ths medical profes
sion. These abuses are said to be practiced
by lodge doctors, clinicians at free clinics,
hospital associations that furnish to the
members treatment by the year at a fixed
rate per month, prescribing druggists or
drug-store steerers, who divert patients
from the regular medical attendant to an
other for pay or favors, and medical men
holding public positions, such as police
surgeons, also engaged in private practice,
who advertise in a questionable manner
and use their public position "unprofes
sionaily" for the purpose of diverting
patients from their regular medical atten
dants or family physician.
The secret organization will attack these
abuses and aim to secure the Ostracism of
physicians whose methods are question
able.
A circular pertaining to the association
contains the following reference to a more
extended scope of the society :
The members of this association are also to
oppose in a secret and concerted manner any
uou-m edical persons who antagonize what is
to the best interests ot" the medical jirofes
moii as ve'l as fair to patrons. It is not to be
expected that members of this association will
lose fees by refusing to consult with lodge doc
'â¢>rs, clinic physicians or hospital association
doctors, but they are expected to avoid con
sultation with such when another can be con
veniently substituted, a preference for others
being always expressed when- the' case and tho
circumstances will permit or justify such
â preference. In fact, i hey are iioi to call such
in consultation or favor them in any manner
professionally or otherwise, and are to avoid
reiOT.mending or sending' patients to hospi
tals or associations that furnish for membeis
treatment by the year at a li>;ed rate per
month.
The scheme for preserving secrecy is
r?marKab!e. It is said to be after a
fashion of an organization devised by Dr.
C. E. Farnnm, for tho purpose of organiz
ing the wheat and cotton growers of the
United States. The plan it really adopted
from Ignatius Donnelly's fancy of an
anarchistic society. In the first place
t here is a self-constitiited central commit
tee of nine members. From this may be
formed nine other circles. From these
nine new circles so formed eighty-one
other new circles are to spring. Each of
the eighty-one members selects for a new
circle a new member, who is to select
eight more to complete the circle. The
control of the association is to be by initia
tive and referendum, each member having
the privilege of proposing any measure
and voting for the acceptance or rejection
of any measure proposed. Any informa
tion to be proposed to all the members is
to reach the committee Through the heads
of the different circles, it being passed up
from the head of one circle to another.
If the membership of trie central com
mittee were not secret any measure to be
proposed might be sent direct to that
committee instead of through the heads
of the different circles.
It seerus that the plan renders it impos
sible for a member to know more than
eight of his fellow members. All mem
bers are to be known by numbers.
Physicians of high "standing who were
interviewed yesterday on behalf of The
Call admit that lodge doctors, association
doctors and others are responsible for
many grievance?, but they doubt tbe pro
priety or success of a secret organization.
The subject was recently brought before a
convention of physicians and was not
approved. The promoters of the secret
plan of dealing with the offenders have,
nowever. deemed it prudent to organize.
Santa Clara County is said to have a
similar organization which has proved
effective.
NOW IT IS COD-FISHING,
Competition in That Line oi
Business Is Actively
Under Way.
A New Company With Headquarters
at Hunters Point Will Soon Be
in Operation.
There is to be opposition in the codfish
business. For years the Lynde & Hough
Company and The McCollam Fishing and
Trading Company enjoyed a practical mo
nopoly, and their curing-houses have been
kept going all the year round. Their
schooners went out every season and came
back loaded down with fish, and the East
ern markets received their quota as regu
larly as September turned up on the alma
nac. Opposition was alight and prices
were maintained. Now, however, the
Alaska Codli&hing Company is in the field.
Jt ha* established a curing-house at Hun
ters Point, and next year will send out a
Ueet of schooners. The La Kin fa is now
beinp cot ready, and as soon as the season
or ens she will lie sent into Bering .Sea.
The La Ninfa is probably the best
known schooner on the coast. She has
been used as a whaler, a sealer, an otter
hunter, been to the halibnt banks nnder
charter, nml now she wiil represent toe
Alaska Cudlishing Company on the cod-
Jish banks of Alaska.
The drying-sheds for the new concern
are now beine rapidly completed at Hun
ters Point. Yesterday the steamer Caro
line took ud a load or hoops and staves,
with which the barrels will be built, and
inside of n month the company expects to
hiivu at least twenty-five men regularly
employed. " â
PRAYER AND COMPLIMENT
I!ev. C. ST. Hill Gives the Pro* and Cons
for Kxtempore Orisons.
Rev. C. M. Hill addressed the Baptist
Preaehers'-Conference yesterday on "Pub
lic Prayer." After remarking, that no
Christian service would be complete with
out prayer, he compared the relative mer
it-< oi Jiiurgical and extempore prayer.
Some of the objections urged against ex
tempore prayer were that it is apt to be
come long and tedious-, that the uncon
scious codicil of the hearer is, "Thank
God we are through with that": another
objection cited was that sometimes prayer
is apt to become a mutual exchanac of
compliments between a visiting minister
and the pastor of the church. The visitor
thanks heaven that the people have a pas
tor possessing so many virtue?, and the
pastor, in the final prayer, exalts the vi p
tuÂ°S of the visitor.
Next week the Baptist Preachers' Con
ference is expecting the arrival of Rev. Dr.
P. L. Wilkins. head of the Baptist Young
People's Union of the United States, and
Rev. Dr. H. E. Woods, superintendent of
Baptist missions for the United StatPS,
an. l Rev. Dr. H. C. Wood?, superintendent
of Baptist missions for the Western States.
Under the auspices of these speakers there
will be a Young People's rally in the First
Church, Oakland, 0:1 the 29 th insr., and
rally in San Francisco at Eiranuei Church
on the 30th inst.
Congregational Club.
Rev. W. A. Tenney spoke to the Con
gregauonal Monday Ciub yesterday morn
ing on "Christ as a Missionary." The
divine leader, he said, was essentially the
missionary of the people. He addressed
the masses, and the rich and mighty were
offended al him. Mr. Tenney took excep
tion to, some of the modern methods of
evangelization, and said there was no
necessity for paying pew rent. Christ
preached in the open air.
The discussion brought out some dis
cussion of modern methods, but Rev.
W. W. Scndder urged his hearers to wipe
off the charge which had~ been sometimes
made against Protestantism that it cared
most for the rich and neglected the poor.
After the club's meeting the Congrega
tional Ministers' Relief Society elected the
following directors: Rev. George Mooar,
Rev. W. Friar, Rev. T. K. Harrison, Ilev.
W. C. Por?d and Rev. H. H. Wikoff. It was
voted that $1100 belonging to the Relief
Society should be invested in Oakland
real estate.
Methodist Ministers.
"Isaiah and His Times" was the subject
of an address which Rev. John Coylc,
D.D., gave to the Methodist Preachers'
Conference yesterday. The doctor pic
tured tho prophet to his hearers in
graphic words, and introduced also a good
deal of histotical information relative to
Isaiah.
A petition was read addressed to the
War Department, which was signed by
most of the ministers, respectlully re
questing the transfer of Rev. J. H. Macora
ber, now the post chaplain at Angel
Island, to the Presidio.
WINS OVER 200,000 ACRES
The Court of Appeals Decides a
Case in Favor of the
F.ailrcad.
Property at Stake Is Si'uatrd Mainly
in Portland and Is Worth
Millions.
By a decision of the Court of Appeals
yesterday the Oregon and California Rail
road secure- the right and title to over
200,000 acres of land lying In and adjacent
to the city of Portland. The victory means
a clear gain of several million dollars to
the corporation and a corresponding loss
on the part of the Government.
The Court of Appeals, however, was not
unanimous in its conclusion, JudÂ«e Mc-
Kenna filing a lengthy dissenting opinion.
The two opinions were based on an action
instituted by the Government some
months ago to declare forfeited certain
lands in Oregon pranted by Congress in
1860 to the Oregon and California Railroad.
The suit involved many minor details
and in a way brought intoquestion many
old land grants. The principal contention
was that the grant to tue Oregon and Cali
fornia Company was within the reserva
tions of the grant made to the Northern
Pacific Company. It was also held that
by filing its map of definite location before
the Northern Pacific Company had fixed
its line of road, either by map or general
route, tho defendant company acquired
priority of right by the exceptions in the
grant made to the rival corporation.
The Circuit Court ol Oregon held a con
trary opinion, however, deciding that the
land had reverted to the Government by
reason of the defendant company's failure
to comr>ly with all the conditions of the
grant. The case was taken to the Court of
Appeals, which body, through Judges
Ross and Hawley, now reverses tbe Circuit
Court and remands the cause, with direc
tions to the court below to dismiss the
bill. Judge TtlcKenna, dissenting in a
lengthy opinion, concludes as follows:
The default of the Northern Pacific Company,
if it was in any, was no concern of the Oregon
and California Company. This company had
no rights except, as I have a. ready said, those
its grant gave it. It could get mmc from Ming
a map of aefinite location or none by building
Its road, or impair none that the Northern
Pacific received by its grant. This seems very
plain, but may not the reasoning be extended
still further? Whatever rights passed to the
Northern Pacific Company by the act of 1864
could only be lost by abandonment or by
resumption by the United States on account
of non-periormance of conditions. Abandon
ment is not claimed, and if it were abondon
meiit of rights or forfeiture of rights it has
always been held not to contribute to railroad
grants.
Were the rights of the Northern Pacific
Company taken away by forfeiture? The ma
jority <>i the court say no. My brother Ross'
language is, "Tnat the Oregon and Califor
nia I'Taiiroari KOt noihing by the forfeiture of
September 2!), 1890, is clear, for the forfeit
ure was for the benefit of tne Government
only. But if uot by that act, not at all."
Judge McKenna also holds that the
Government ne\er had any rii_'ht to make
the grant to the Oregon and California road
in 1860, for the reason that the same had
already been granted to the Northern Pa
cific road two years previously, and that
they still had a right to come in and
claim it.
SOME RARE PLANTS.
Wonders That Are Growing la the Park
Conservatory.
Headgardener Holbrowof the Park Con
servatory takes pride in showing some
rare plants that have bloomed in the oast
two weeks. One is an orchid from Mex
ico, which is without a common name, but
is known to floriculturists as the Palumna
Nobilis, a beautiful white flower with a
yellow center, one that is very rare out
side of the country from which it came.
Another is called the rattlesnake orchid,
from Manila. From the leaves shoots a
long stem, at the end of which is a iiower,
dirty white and brown, that is a perfect
imitation of the rattles of a snake. One
of the rarest of all orchids is the Cvpripe
dium Speceranum.or the East India lady's
slipper, which is m a deiicate shade of
purple. Within the domes there is now
in full bloom, with a wreati of oranee-red
flowers, wnatis said to be tug plant that
creeps higher than any other known. It
is the Cape of Good Hope trumpet vine,
and its flowers are pendant from the high
est point in the dome, at least seventy feet
above the ground.
Prohibitionist* File - Petition.
The Alameda County Committee of the I'ro
hibition Party yesterday petitioned the Su
preme Court, by Joseph Humphreys, chairman
of the committee, for a writ of mandate to
compel the County Cleric of Alrmeda County
to place their nominees on the ballot. The
Prohibitionists, alter the County Clerk refused
to accept their nominations, on the ground
that their application did not show that they
had received 3 per cent of the vote cast at the
last election, took the matter into the Superior
Court. That tribunal refused to issue an
order. Then the petition was brought iuto the
Supreme Court.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1896.
NEVADA INVITES
MEN OF ELOQUENCE
Colcord Says His State Will
Poll a Large Vote for
McKinley.
The Republican National Com
mittee Has Sent a Ton of
Literature.
IN SIX DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.
Free Silver, the cx-Gcvernor Siys, Is
Good for Mine-Owners, but Not
for Others.
Ex-Governor R. K. Colcord of Nevada
arrived here yesterday. He cama to see
if he could engage some Republican speak
ers to go to tbe sagebrush State.
The ex-Governor says there is need of
EX-GOVERNOR COLCORD of Nevada, Who Says His State Wil 1
Cast From 3500 to 4000 Votes for McKinley.
{Sketched from life by a "Call" artis'..]
them there, and that if a vigorous cam
paign had been inaugurated early enough
there would have been no question about
carrying the State.
"As it is we will get from 3500 to 40C0 of
the 10.000 votes that will be cast in Ne
vada,'' said the ex-Governor. "The Re
publican National Committee, which has
sent out large quantities of literature to
all the States, has been very liberal toward
us. It has sent us about a ton of printed
matter. It came in the form of hand
books, pamphlets, circulars, clippings and
composed in part entire speeches of emi
nent men on finance.
"Thi3 literature was printed in six or
seven different languages, and we nave
sent large lots of it to every mining camp
and ranch in Nevada.
"When the St. Louis convention ad
journed there were a great many men in
the State who were thoroughly dissatis
fied with the financial plank. Even the
leading Republicans were nlmost rea'.iy
to indorse Mr. Bryan a little later when
he was nominated, but when they read
the whole platform and saw how the Presi
dent was condemned for calling cut troops
in time of danger, and saw that all the
dangerous men were supporting Bryan,
thefr faith was shaken. But more than
this, Bryan came out and emphatically
indorsed everything in the platform.
"The Republicans have had no sperch
in Nevada yer, but we are now trying to
raise a little money to do a little cam
paigning during these closing day?. We
are arranging lor some public speakers.
We already have enthusiastic Republican
clubs in four counties. These clubs are
at Carson, Reno, Wadsworth and Wel
lington.
"Besides these we have fonr newspapers
in Nevada that are out and out Republi
can. These are the Reno Gazette, the Car
son News, Elko Free Press and Yerington
Rustler. There are also one or two others
that aid us some.
"If we only had a longer campaign I am
satisfied we would carry the entire State
for McKinley. I will admit that when
this campaign opened I did not under
stand the money question. Like many
others I was nominally for free silver, but
as soon as I began to read ud on the sub
ject I saw as clear as day that it wouldn't
do.
"And all our people are open to convic
tion. All that need be dono is, to show
them they are wrong. That is why the
cause of Republicanism is bound to tri
umph.
"Take it on the Comstock for instance.
The miners there get the uniform rate of
$4 a day. Well, if there was free coinage
of silver they could not hofce to eel $8 a
day, and so they and the peopl3 who do
not own silver mines have concluded that
free silver could only be of benefit to the
silver-mine owners.
"It would be a good thing for Senator
Jones, Senator Stewart and Mr. New-lands,
selfishly considered, but how could it help
the masses? lam satisfied that even if
Bryan were elected the mints would never
bo opened to the free coinage of silver
while the commercial ratio is so far from
the existing ratio. The reason is that
when Congressmen are elected they will
have had time to look into the matter.
They will realize that they are responsible
to their constituents, and they will not do
something that will be of lasting injury to
the country."
Ex-Governor Colcord expects to start on
his return to Nevada this evening.
Ocean View Noil- Partisans.
The Fnrallon Non-Partisan Club met In

IN DEFENSE OF HIS LIFE,
Mitchell Arraigned for the
Murder of Edward T.
Hicks.
A Ssarch Warrant Issued for H'cks'
Brass Knuckles and
Revolver.
Attorney Joseph A. Mitchell was ar
raigned in Judge Joachimsen's court yes
terday for the murder of Private Detective
Edward I. Hicks in the building at 927
I Market street last Thursday afternoon.
Attorney J. N. E. Wilson>^:ho was with
| John F. Mullen for the attendant, said
they were not r>adv to go on with the ex
amination because the Coroner's inquest
had not been held, bat as Mr. Warren,
one of the witnesses for the prosecution,
| desired to leave the Cty, as a matter of
i accommodation he was ready to consent
that his testimony be taken.
J. B. Warren said :
I am a Presbyterian minister by profession,
but at present employed by the Muuobaselti
j Benevolent Association. The office of the
j association la on the sixth floor ot 1)27 Market
I street, diagonally across t lie hall ironi the
office occupied by Hicks and Mitchell.
I was sitting in my office nbout 2:30 P. M.
last Thursday when I nuarrt a pistol shot. It
had a muflled sound. I rushed to the door ot'
the office and saw Mitchell standing nt the
head of the stairway. lie hnd a pistol in his
hand and his attitude gave mo The iroprossion
that he had just wheeled around facing in my
j direction. 1 then saw Hicks just standing
outside his office door. His hands were clasped
to his breast and he seemed to b* stooping.
As I saw Hicks, Mitchell raised his pistol
and fired, the bullet passing through Hicks'
hat and striking the jamb ot the door. Hicks
started to walk toward my door and had taken
only two or three steps when Mitchell, who
I had not changed his position, fired again, the
bullet striking the wall. He held tne pistol
pointed in my direction, and as his manner
was that of a man about to lire again I dodged
behind the door Imme and was about to close
the door, when Hicks staggered, threw his
; hand against the glass of the door, smashing
i it, nnd lell on his face. I should think that
between the sound of the first shot and the
.falling of Hicks' body about a minute
elapsed.
On cross-examination by Attorney Wil
son the witness said that the shot tnat
killed Hicks was evidently fired in the
office and that Mitchell was apparently
running away from Hicks when he first
saw them.
The further hearing of the case was con
tinued till Friday, as the Coroner's inquest
will be held Thursday.
Attorney Wilson confirmed the state
ment already published that Mitchell will
plead self-defense.
Following up this line of defense Wilson
yesterday afternoon obtained a search
warrant in Judge Campbell's court for a
pair of brass knuckle? and a revolver be
lieved to be in H cks' safe-deposit box 86
of the Pacific Coast Savings Society. 806
Market street. The articles will be looked
for to-day.
In the complaint sworn to by Wilson it
is alleged that Hicks, on the morning of
October 15, committed an assault with In
tent to murder upon Mitcitell with a pair
of brass knuckles and a revolver, and that
the articles are necessary for the defense
of Mitchell.
Mrs. Gregory, Hicks' sister, was granted
letters of administration on her brother's
estate by Judge Coffey yesterday.

IUN IN THE "TOWN TOPICS."
Attempted Robbery of the "Pay Train"
at the Grand Opera-House
Last Evening.
Julia Marlowe Taber and Robert Taber
opened their season at the Baldwin Thea
ter last nic;ht in an adaptation of George
Eliot's "Romola," by Elwyn A. Barron.
Their reason for choosing this production
for their inaugural performance must have
been that "Romola," in its stage garb, is
a novelty. The Tabers only produced it
a few weeks ago, and they spent a large
sum of money in putting the work lavishly
upon the stage, but also passed part of
their summer holidays in Florence study
ing historic accessories and generally im
pregnating themselves with Florentine
local coloring.
The result of this study is seen in the
play, which last night presented a series
of exquisitively beautiful tableaux.
All the Italian local coloring, and all the
finished and delightful acting of the ac
complished Tabers, however, would not
gloss over tbe very apparent fact that
"Romola" has little to commend it as a
drama.
It begins with an absolute lack of action,
and in the third act it blossoms into melo
drama.
The fourth act contains a bridge-leaping
Bcene, which is more thrilling than Steve
Brodie's Bowery bound, and the last act
culminates in a scene which should ap
peal to every gallery-boy's heartâ Tito's
foster-father is watching in the rushes,
and Tito, limp and exhausted, crawls out
of the river.
"Baldassarre!" shrieks Tito on beholding
his enemy. "Yes, Baldassarre !" cries the
infuriated old man, and he at once falls
upon Tito and chokes the life out of him,
and Tito struggles and dies, gurgling
feebly. It was the old man's original in
tention to slay Tito with a butcher-knife,
which he stole from Tessa, but he had loÂ«t
it in a previous encounter with Tito â and
if all this is not melodrama, what is?
The fact is that Elwyn A. Barron under
took a forlorn hope when he dramatized
George Eliot's philosophical, brilliant,
but wholly unaramatic novel. Eliot
lends herself to dramatization about as
readily as Wordsworth would do. But to
people who were content to feast the eye
and ear and to admire what the actor's
art can do for an almost hopeless subject
"Romola" was a rare treat last night.
"Caviar to the general." it is true, but
the few who appreciate caviar Jed the ap
plause and went into ecstasies over Julia
Marlowe Taber's intellectual, womanly {
and altogether delightful and fascinating j
conception of the proud, loyal, true
hearted Florentine. She was "more than
merely beautiful; witn her old-world
gowns and her wealth of ruddy hair she
looked like Dante's Beatrice, come to life,
aDd in the lOve scene with Tito and her
subsequent disillusion, despair and for
giveness one forgot that it was mere act
ing, so truly and tenderly womanly was
she.
The shifty selfish Tito was excellently
played by Kobert Taber. On the stage it
is next to impossible to depict all the
subtleties and complexities of the wily
Greek's character, but Robert Taber came
near doing bo. The rest of the cast was
excellent. Savanarola, a very minor part
in the play, was carefully acted by Btrrett
Roe, Bernardo del Nero was well played
by Dodson L. Mitchell, and to name tbe
other performers who showed talent and
skill would be to go through the cast.
The fourth act is followed by an epi
logue, which soothes the audience after
the melodrama if anything couid soothe
them for seeing so much art Jayished on
such an impossible play.
There was a good house, which received
the Tabers with warmth, but sustained
rather than enjoyed "Romola."
At the Columbia.
"Town Topics," with which the Broadway
comedians opened for a season at the Colum
bia last evening, Is a lively jumble of bur
lesque, specialties and general fun-making
from start to finish. There is no plot, not
even the skeleton of a story, upon which to
hang the farce-comedy, as it is called. It Is
only an entertainment of the most rollicking
order.
The principal roles are filled by: John
Queen as Cinch, with racetrack ideas; Wil
liam Keller as Hiram Quick, with ideas that
don't tit cable-cars and slot machines; Joseph
Harrington as Chinneway, with nothing on
bis mind but his hat; James Tenbrooke as
Herman Krauss, with a boisterous but harm
legs disposition; Frank Caverly as Arthur
Pembroke, with a scent of new-mown
hay; William H. Mack as Willie Payne,
with champagne ideas on a beer income;
Miss Nellie Hennett as Mrs. Qufck. with Kansas
ideas and a will of her own; Miss Beatrice
Norman as Delia Ware, with numerous en
gagements; Miss Elsie Nugent as Pearl-but
tons, with a taste for icecream, and an irides
cent bunch of beauties, whose only mission in
life is to make life a happy thought.
Misses Sennett, Nugent and Heckler go
ttirougn a couple of dances called the "aero- J
batic" and the "whirlwind," and the motion's i
ot these performances were enough to make
the audience, especially those in the front
row of seats, catch their breaths. The house
was crowded, and there Is every indication
that iarge audiences will be in order the rest
oi the week.
At the Grand Opera-Bonae.
Florence Bindley succeeded in winning the
favor of a large audience at the Grand Opera
house last evening In her play, "The Pay
Train." Miss Bindley has a pleasing voice
and manner and her musical contributions,
especially her xylophone solo on the kind
lings in the woodpiie, were warmly applauded.
The piece is full of humor as well as senti
ment, and the mechanical effects often start-
Hug, especially the explosion of the locomotive
that is nauling the villain away from his pur
suersâa novel way of getting rid of the bad
man of the play-
There is Â«n attempt to rob the pay train, and
of course the robbers are foiled, and in a most
entertaining manner. Frank. Hatch as tbe
heroine's grandfather and Walter Fessler were
pood in their respective roles, while Mortimer
Know, who had seen better day 6, was a veri
table specimen of tramp literature. The whole
cast is strong, and the play will draw good
houses during the week.
At the Orpheuin.
An unusually strong bill Is being presented
this week at the Orpheum. Most of the acts
are new, and some of them have come direct
from Paris and London.
A turn that went very strong last night was
ihat of the three Brothers Horn and Miss Joe
Reeve*. Since the success of Chevalier, so
many bogus "CoÂ»ter" people have been
palmed off on a too-confiding public that it
was a pleasure to recognize genuine London
types in the brothers and their clever little
collaborator. One of the brothers took the
part of a member of the shoeblack brigade,
with aspirations toward the prize ring. In
order to test hi* prowess he challenges a pass
ing society swell to a set-to with the gloves,
and the gamy way In which the swell knocks
the bootblack out almost made the house
cheer. The third brother took the panola
newsboy very cleverly, and although Miss Joe
Reeves has not a strong voice, she is a plumD
and pleasing little person, and sings very
prettily.
Another amusin* act is the circus-riding
done by Herr Grais' remarkntle trick donkey
aud baboon. Charles Colby is one of the clev
erest ventriloquists seen here for a long time,
and Miss AUie Way's dancing, as the mtchani
cal doll, was relished by the audience. Her,
Burk acd Belmar played on various instru
ments, the saxophone solo being the only per
formance that had any musical value. They
ended their act with a'sort of harlequinade, in
which they leaped through windows and
chimneys, and came bounding out where they
werÂ« least expected, in continually varying
costume. Clayton, Jenkins and the accom
plished Jasper made their reappearance after
over a year's absence, and were warmly
greeted. " A very good juggling entertainment
was given by Norine, assisted by Eldora, and
the Madrid" Sextet completed the strong list
of novelties.
"Ugly Duckling" at thÂ» Alcazar.
The Alcazar stock company presented Mrs.
Carter's great society drama, "The Ugly Duck
ling," very creditably to an enthusiastic
audience last night at the Alcazar. May Buck
ley, a direct antithesis to the adjective In the
title role, played the part with a freshness,
naiveness, winsomeness and a pathos in turn
that captivated the audience and Drought out
repeated encores in several scenes.
Tohn T. Sullivan's make-up and acting as the
Italian Count bent on a terrible revenge that
is almost hypnotic in its intensity made Male
testa the strong character that the author,
Paul Potter of Trilby drama fame, intended it
should be. Tne others of the cast portrayed
their parts most acceptably. "The Tjgly Duck
ling" is full of interest all the way through.
Every scene is very dramatic and the play is
one of the strongest that has yet been pre
sented at the Alcazar. The scenic effects and
stage setting are excellent.
At tbe Tivoli.
There was a large house at the Tivoli last
night to inaugurate the second week of "The
Babes in the Wood." Most of the numbers
were encored, some of them several times, and
the whole performance went with plenty of
spirit ana vim.
POTRERO CAMPAIGN GUNS
Fired Last Night by Dare,
O'Brien and Other Oratori
cal Gunners.
A Pleasing Reference to Irving M
S:ott Loudly Applauded by
the Audience.
The Potrero Opera-house was crowded
last night with mechanics and working
men to hear able sneakers on the present
political issues. The meeting was called
to order by T. C. Duff, who introduced Z.
U. Dodge, chairman of the McKinley and
Hobart Campaign Committee.
After a few remarks W. F. Gibson, one
of the trainers of the new ciiarter, was in
troduced.
"The present election," asserted Mr.
Gibson, "involves the stability of the
Nation and the honor of the American
people. Prior to Cleveland's election aud
under a Republican administration the
National debt was being paid off at the
rate of $6,000,000 a month, but the Demo
crats were obliged from their wasteful
methods to issue bonds to cover the run
ning expenses of the Governmentâ a thing
unprecedented in our history."
Thomas Â£. O'Brien, nominee for Con
press from the Fourth District, besought
his audience, as a laboring man among
them twenty years ago, to support the Re
publican ticket and help woo back pros
perity.
Ex-Congressman W. H. Sawtelle of Du
luti). Minn., in exposing the impotency of
the Democratic clamor against the Sher
man act of 1873 and the allegations that it
was passed by stealth and double-dealing,
showed conclusively from the Congres
sional Record that it had been before both
houses for three years and debated seven
ty-nine times.
The speaker was loudly cheered when
he said that under a free-trade policy the
ships of our na^y were built in England;
but to Irving M. Scott the American peo
ple return thanks, for $3,000,000, the
cost of the Oregon, remaining in this
country, $2,000,000 of -which went to labor
alone. This remark was loudly ap
plauded.
John T. Dare spoke of the importance of
electing a Republican Legislature in order
that a Republican Senator might be re
turned.
Judge Swinnerton of Stockton indorsed
the remarks made by Dare, and prophesied
a grand Republican victory in California
November 3.
A letter was received from Irving M.
Scott, regretting his absence from the
meeting, caused by the arrival of the
chairman of the Naval Committee of the
House.

MUST RAISE A
MARSH BLOCKADE
Cordelia "Preservers" to Be
Served With a
Notice.
Obstruction of a Navigable
Slough Near Suisun Must
Be Removed.
HUNTERS MEAN BUSINESS.
A Mass-Meeting of Sportsmen and
Anglers Will Be Held Next
Week.
The Sportsmen's Protective Association
will hold a mass-meeting in this City
next week to which all sportsmen and
anglers are invited, due notice of which
will be given in the advertising columns of
The Call.
Yesterday the attorney for the associa
tion, Major James Smith, held a consulta
tion with Assistant United States Attor
ney Knight regarding the blockade of a
navigable siough in the Suisun marshes.
Mr. Sftith produced sufficient evidence to
satisfy the attorney that the Frank Horan
slough was navigable, and to-day Air.
Kellogg, the president of the Cordelia
Gun Club, will be served with a notice to
remove the obstruction to navigation in
the slough in question within twenty-four
hours from the time of notification,
otherwise action will be taken against the
club and the man who was engaged by
the club to construct a barrier at the
month of Ibe Frank Horan siouph.
Thomas Casey, a member of the Protective
Association, who was appointed one of a
committee on navigation, etc., said yes
terday tnat some years ago, when the rail
road company was having constructed a
drawbridge over the Cordelia Slough, the
siough which is now obstructed by a for
midable barrier to navigation was navi
gated by the capfein of a schooner who
conveyed in his craft lumber to the bridge
builders. It has been also stated that
schooners laden with merchandise sailed
up the slough long before the time the
railroad contemplated^ laying a railroad
track over tlie Suisun m'ar3h.
The members of the Cordelia Club con
tend that the Frank Horan slough is not
navigable, and doubtless they will fight
the matter in the courts. However, pub
lic sentiment is aroused, and the sports
men of this City and State look forward
with particular interest to the outcome.
The sportsmen who had such a narrow
escape Jast week in Cordelia Slough by
the blowing up of the gasoline launch

The arrow flies with the wind. The top figure*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of "melted snow in inches and hui.dredths,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rainÂ».
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when '.he "low" Is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coas'- warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 19 âThe stock mar
ket was anything but active to-day, the sales foot
ing up only 152,474 shares, but this was a radical
change In the temper of. speculation and a bullish
tone characterized the -dealings throughout. The
upward movement received its first Impetus from
the buoyancy and excitement in the grain mar
kets, which influenced the stock market. In ad 11
--tlon to 'this, renewed weakness of sterling ex
change exercised a favorable influence, as a reduc
tion of a full cent on posit d rales for long and half
a cent In demand "rates foreshadows gold Imports
to this country at an early date.
, There were several reactions in the stock market
during the session, owing to the sharp fluctuations
in the rates for money, but each decline brought
In a nnmber of buying orders, which not only ral
lied the list but led to a still higher ran.o of
quotations ih:tn was current before. The rise was
equal to Vife'^i per cent and whs due in great
measure to the fact that the shorts look at it as a
matter of continued strength. The improvement
was greatest in the shares and the short Interest
was heavy, such, for lns.ance, as Sugar, the
Grangers. Louisville' acd ' Nashville, Western
Union, Tobacco, Leather preferred and the Mouth
westerns. '.. ; .. ,
The market left off firm In tone. Net changes

Manhattan was an exception, having been Irregu

CHICAGO, lit.'.' Oct. 19.â Liverpool sent out the
news that wheat prices were up from .3d to' 4Vid
at that place this morning, and forthwith our
market tacked 3c to Saturday's final quotations.
Further advances occurred as the session pro
gressed and the market bore a nervous appear
ance at times. News, unless / It pertains to the
foreign situation, bears the mark of Insignificance.:
The visible supply, which usually attracts atten
tion on Monday, was scarcely mentionid to-diiy.
It showed an increase or 2,374,000 bushels. Re
ceipts were good, Chicago having i.BU cars where
315 were estimated, and the Northwest had 1642
cars against 1079 last Monday. â¢ .
Local Inspections from store amounted to 12,500
bushels. â  'I he amount on ocean passage increased

them to be approximated at y.000,000. Most all

I market, corn was considerably higher In price early,
â  with business displaying activity to correspond with
] the improvement in value. Ul course aside from
' me strength Derived from wheat mere was little
I information favorable to this grain. Liverpool
quoted l%d gain, tint that also was a- matter of
i sympathy. Receipts were heavy st 1&52 cars, 1

I so snurp and | persistent that It has turned the

j apparently not frightened by the unprecedented
rise and is gobbling up all Wheat tendered It. The

: under the conditions it does no; seem probublethat
It Â»Jll full hacK much, If indeed it falls back at all.;
: The general opinion 13 lhac it will go still higher, <
and that we will have a good Wheat market for at
I least a year to come. - . . â¢ . . :

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
tiOS Broadway, Oct. 19. j
The greatest barbecue since the time
when the eastern end of tne county was
the scene of Spanish bull-fights has been
planned for next Saturday. The Republi
can County Committee has formally ac
cepted the offer of the citizens of Hay
wards and the State Central Committee
has signified its hearty indorsement of the
project, and;the arrangements are just
about completed.
Although politics will be the predomi
nating feature of the day the people of
Haywards have another object in view.
They want to draw an immense crowd
from every town in the county and have a
jo.ly, good-natured gathering. The hosts

There i 3 a good opportunity to show
their town at a time of year when condi
tions are usually unfavorable for outdoor
gatherings, and the citizens have decided
to make me moit of it.
Although the barbecue is under the
auspices of the Republican party citizens
of ay political faiths have joined tcgettier
to make tne affair wortny of the town and
have subscribed liberally. The town will
be decorated and the fie ta will be heid in
the busiest portion. The barbecue will
not be neld, as is usual, in a field, but in
the large school lot off B street The
most experienced Mexican that can be
found has been engaged to attend to the
cooking of the Deeves. All the fruit and
coffee that can be desired nas been do
nated and the committee is prepared to
handle 10,000 people if that number shall
attend.
"We are all in this," said Hugh O'Neill,
a leading Democrat, this morning. "It
is a good thing for the town to get a few
thousand people here and show them
what we can do. It won't hurt ua any
thing to listen to General Barnes."
When General Barnes, who is the chief
speaker of the day, mounts the platform,
he wili be greeted by many people who
think with him and by many who are
willing to be convinced, and possibly by
some who differ; but he will be cheered by
all, for Haywards has determined to
make ail her guests welcome.
H. E. Brunner, the chairman of the
finance committee, has met with substan
tial encouragement, and promises a great
time to all who attend.

THE MINISTER
KISSED HER HAND
Gallant Conclusion of a
Salvation Army
Romance.
Lieutenant Bovett Whi'e on Fur
lough Weds Fretty Miss
Bertha Brown.
fIEV. E. DAVIS' PRECEDENT.
Proof That All Is Fair in Love
and Wir, Even Religious
Warfare.
Oakland Office San Fkakcisco Call,)
9UB Broadway, Oct. 19. |
Miss Bertha Jeanette Brown, a pretty
young nurse, has won a husband and
the Salvation Army has lost an efficient
officer. Incidentally Rev. Edwards Davi^
has launched an innovation in bis method
of saluting the bride at a home wedding.
About a year ago Edwin James Bovett
was an earnest lieutenant in the Oakland
corps. He was duly commissioned as a
lieutenant and Mat to labor in an interior
town. Betore many months passed Lieu
tenant Bovett began to show signs of
failing health. His earnestness and over-
zealouaness were noted and he was sent
for a rest, or furlough as it is called in the
Salvation Army. TLen the secret came
out, for when the Bick lieutenant went to
the Home of Rest at Beulah it was learned
that an affaire de cceur was more re
sponsible for his failing health than his
inability to stand hard woiK.
When it was given out that h- 1 was suffer
ing from consumption Miss Bertha Jeanette
Brown declared herself. During the pe
riod of training at the garrison the lieu
tenant had fallen in love with one of the
prettiest members of the audience, but it
had to be kept a secret Under the army
rules, which an officer swears to obey be
fore he is commissioned, he must give no
tice of his love affairs to headquarters,
which do not sanction the marriage of
officers to soldiers, much less to those
who are not even members of the order.
One afternoon several months ago Lieu
tenant Bovett crossed the bay and con
sulted Major KeppeL The major saw
plainly mat it was a genuine case of love,
and that the lieutenant was sore at heart
at having to choose between his vows to
the army and his sweetheart, so a compro
mise was practically agreed to. The lieu
tenant should go on a long furlough, and
with returning health he would be better
able to grapple with his conscience.
In the unfettered company of Mi-s
Bertha Brown tne lieutenant speedily re
gained nib health and he la still on fur
lough, but does not call himsjlf lieuten
ant. His permission to go on furlough
was somewhat in the nature of a "fine
with no alternative" to a poor man.
Last Friday night the lieutenant on fur
lough was wedded to Miss Brown at the
residence of Mrs. Simpson, on Franklin
street Rev. Edwards Davis performed tue
ceremony.
When the time came which enstom has
made optional with the minister as to
whether or not he will kiss the
bride, Rev. Mr. Davis rather sur
prised the wedding party. He made
one of his most dignified bows
and gallantly taking the lady's hand he
imprinted a kiss upon it. The bride looted
a trifle disappointed, for the minister is a
handsome, imposing bachelor, but the
guests, and the groom especially, declare
that he set a very desirable precedent.
WEDDING AT HAYWARDS.

Nuptials of Miss Kennedy

first charge the sentence in the seconti case
would either be very light or suspended.
High was released from jail this morn
ing in time to eat breakfast at a restaurant
and attend court to hear his seend sen
e:ice. His attorney, Emil Nusbaumer,
made a brief plea for leniency.
Judge Wood sentenced the prisoner to
s:xty days in the City Prison.
Attorney Nusbaumer said that the
court's sentence was null and void, as
there was a motion forÂ« new trial pend
ing that had not beei^ decuied. In order
to straighten the record Jud?e Wood set
aside the judgment, denied the motion for
a new trial and again passed sentence.
A writ of habeas corpus was granted
this afternoon hy Judge Ellsworth, made
returnable at 2 p. M. Wednesday alter
noon. 3ail was refused till the writ was
heard.

of the representatives of the California

definitely, as there is no use of trying to
dodge it now. While I have the groatest

to observe it as I see fit and am willing

A HOT DISPUTE
IN THE SYNOD
Rev. F. R. Farrand's Talk
Excites I. J. Trumbull's
Friends.
A Wordy War Ov^r the Finances
of San Anselmo
Seminary.
AN OUTING IN THE AFTERNOON
Delegates Visited Institutions of San
Rafael and Drove to
Tamalpais.
Those who hoped that the Presbyterian
S^'nod of this year would be a harmonious
gathering of relicious brethren, dwelling
in peace, have been disappointed.
Yesterday's session resulted in an ani
mated personal discussion, beginning with
the report of tha committee on theological
seminaries.
It baa been alleged that Rev. F. R. Far
rand, chairman of the committee on tueo
logical seminaries, had charged I. J.
Trumbull with incompetency in the man
agement of the San Anselmo Seminary.
Mr. Farrand hotly denied that he had
made such a charge, but had merely stated
that some theological students had been
turned away from the seminary on ac
count of a deficit in the scholarship funds.
This fact, he said, had no connection with
a charge of incorntietency in the manage
ment of the funds by Mr. Trumbull.
On Saturday, however, Air. Trumbull
haa won t!ie sympathies of the' synod by
the declaration that he had never heard
that students were turned away from the
seminary because of a lack of funds and
that the conimitieemen on seminaries
were doing all they could to force him
out of thu position he had held for twenty
live years.
Mr. Farrand crowded the point and all
the members of the committee voted in
execut've session in accordance with Mr.
Farrand's version of the case. A member
of the synod took offense and said there
was no justification ior charging a mem
ber ol the synod with prevarication, but
the speaker called nitn down.
Other friends of Mr. Trumbull tried to
justify him, but they were not heard.
Rev. G. C. Giffen was elected moderator
against Rev. Dr. Mackenzie by a vote of
117 to 49, winning because he wan the first
home missionary that ever filled the
position.
SYNOD AT SAN RAFAEL.
Two Hundred Members Visit the
"Capital of Presibyterianlsm."
Fully 200 member 3 of tne Presbyterian
Synod, counting the ladies of the party,
visited San Rafael to-day, which, Dr.
Noble says, is the capital of Presbyterian
ism on the Pacific Coast.
The first point to receive attention was
the orphanage, which now has ninety in
mates. The clergymen spoke in terms of
admiration for the quarters and all the
arrangements of the little onta' home.
On the next block the party visited the
Mount Tamalpais Miiitary Academy, in
specting the capacious school quarters,
scientific department, cottages, cym
nasium, bathing tank, tennis courts, etc.,
and wi nesseii a fine drill by Lieutenant
Sage with the navy ordnance. Several
very critical members of the synod ex
pressed the opinion tnat this academy is
the best school of its class in the State.
A plentiful lunch was served to the
whole company of visitors, after which
speeches were made.
Leaving the academy the synodical
party took the narrow-gauge train for San
Anselmo, where they inspected the mag
nificent structures of the Theological
Seminary, and later returned to the City
in time for the evening session of the
synod.
THE C. E.'S CRUSADE.
It Condemns Liquor Traffic at Groceries
aud Gambling.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 19.â The County
Christian Endeavor Union held an im
portant meeting to-night in Y. M. C. A.
Hall, at which delegates representing 6000
members were present. As stated in this
morning's Call, the convention took
radical action regarding the racetrack
matters and the liquor traffic.
The recent publication in the organ of
the Liquor-dealers' Association was made
the basis of a lively argument. The mat
ter was called up by the 'statement that
ther 1 ? were in the district west of Fruit
vale avenue 322 saloons for a population
of less than 85,000, being one for every
fifty- four voters.
The union placed itself on record as fol
lows:
Besolved, That we appeal to all Christian
people in Alameda County to patronize only
such gr jeers as do sot deal In intoxicaaong
liquor.
The position of this body on the gam
bling matter recently handled by the
Methodist Ministers' Union in connection
with the Oakland Trotting Pars and the
incorporation of a new municipality to
protect it from outside interference was
set out in the following:
Resolved, That it is the sense of this union
that we are opposed to all forms of gambling,
further that we oppose the incorporation of
any municipality for the protection of gam
bling Interests.
The fact that the Oakland Board of
Trade and the Oakland Merchants' Ex
change entered the contest with resolu
tions indorsing the racing association was
also considered, and resulted in the fol
lowing being adopted as the union's re
ply to their statements:
Besolved, That we call upon all Christian
people a. id those interested in the moral wel
fare of the community to withdraw all politi
cal ana financial support from such persons as
â any in any way encourage the establishment
of gambling institutions in our midst.
CHANGE IN NAME.
The Proposed Incorporation Slay Be
Called Golden Gate.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 19.â Residents in
the eastern and northern part of the terri
tory which it is proposed to incorporate
into a new town about the racetrack are
protesting against the name Emeryville
and have taken steps to have it
cnanged to Golden Gate. As yet little
opposition has been manifested. What
there is comes from the church element
and women, neither of wh.ch class has
much vote in the matter, and it is ex
pected that the matter will be carried
nearly unanimously when it goes to a
vote.
Trustees in Wordy War.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 19.â The meet
ing of the Hoard of Trustees to-niirht
was enlivened by two lively wars of
words. The first was upon the opening of
Taylor avenue and was only settled alter
what seemed would terminate in blows.

NIETO AND YORKE
AT THE' TEMPLE
Both Spoke Last Evening
on Religious Toler
ance.
Uncomplimentary Allusions Fre
quently Made to the
A. P. A.
A LARGE AUDIENCE PRESENT
The New Charter Will Be Discussed
N?xt Thursday Even
ing.
A very large audience attended the
meeting at the Metropolitan Temple last
evening under the auspices of the Ameri
can 'Women's Liberal League. Rev.
Father Yorke presided. Rev. Dr. Nieto
was the speaker announced for the even
ing. Rev. Father Yorke also spoKe. An
organ solo, embracing a medley of patri
otic tunes, opened the proceedings.
Rev. Dr. Nieto said that he had heard
of sulphurous exhalations from the plat
form where he then stood. In imagina
tion lie cnuld see the flames issuing from
the mouths of the American Protective
Association speakers.
The American flag was a symbol of re
ligious liberty. The constitution of the
United States contained more patriotism
than was in the hearts of some people.
He bad not long ago received a letter
alter he had presided at one of Father
Y'orke's meetings. The substance of the
letter was that he (Nieto) was a humbug
when he said tiiat he wanted religious
toleration.
Rabbi Nieto spoke of the catrlotism of
the Jews even under greatest adversity.
The Jews and the Irishmen, he said, had
always been targets for abuse.
There were different roads to salvation,
chosen according to the people who were
to receive it, and that was all there was to
it. The element of religions persecution,
he said, was still dormant and only waits
developing circumstances to fan it into
lambent flame.
When U.e culture of the race was spoken
of, along with the wide difference ci edu
cation, there was no excuse for religious
persecution. Did those who persecuted
wish to give themselves a testimonial of
ignorance? If so, tney had succeeded.
The spirit which led to religious persecu
tion was diahplical.
The American people are disgusted with
humbug. Tnere ha-i been enough of fra
ternal war in the United states. Patri
otic Americans should frown on any at
tempt to provoke hostile sentiments in
any part of the country. No one could
rind one dogma of the Catholicc hurch or
one article of faith that was against pa
triotism.
The American people were the eqnal of
any people on earth. "Why should they
be behind other peoples intue matter of
recognition of religious prejudice? Let
every man worshiD according to his con
science. There was but one judgeâ God.
go long as the beans of men were right
and they were honest and good the rest
was merely a matter of choice.
Rev. Father Yorke spoke at some length.
He said the purpose of those who were
striving to raise reiigious prejudice was to
raise the wind. They wore trying to fill
the yawning void In their pockets. Re
jected by all decent men and dragging out
a miserable existence, they were living out
of the pockets of certain politicians. The
large meeting indicated that Jew and Gen
tile, Protestant and Catholic were stand
ins: together for religious liberty.
Things have come to a bad pass when a
political ticket was put up by a body of
men who were afraid to* hava their delib
erations publicly known; whose emblem
was not the star, but the dark lantern.
Father Yorke denied that at the last
meeting he had asked his hearers to vote
for those he preferred. He had wanted
them to vote for their own choice.
Next Thursday evening, .father Yorke
announced, a deoate in opposition to the
proposed new charter will take place in
the Metropolitan Temple.
SHIPS FOR SALE.
Four Have Been Sold to the Salmon
Packers Inside of a
Month.
- Another Eastern ship has been pur
chased by the salmon packers. Three
weeks ago the Alaska Packers' Association
secured the Bohemia, Sterling and Santa
Clara, and yesterday the Alaska Improve
ment Company secured the Centennial.
The latter arrived here from New York on
the 2d inst. with a general cargo and ever
since her owners have been trying to dis
pose of her. She finally changed hands
for $14,G00 and Captain Coicord will go
back home overland. Captain Pederson,
late of the barks Helen W. Almy and
Margaret, will take over the Centennial
and transform iier into a salmon carrier.
"We find it cheaper to buy ships than
charter them," said one of thÂ» salmon
packers yesterday. "Every season it has
cost from $1000 to $1500 a month for each
boat we chartered. They would be tone
six or seven months and we had to pay
out the vaiue ot the vessel in rent.
"Then the quarters for the Chinese and
White crew haU to be fixed up and ell the
necessary accommodations put in. "When
the boat got back to San Francisco we had
to tear out all toe fixtures and make the
Tessel as good as new. In that way ihe
expenditure wis considerable, and added
to the charter money made up almost the
price of the ship. Now we have our own
vessels, and if they do not earn a cent for
five months they will make it up during
the other seven, when we havethemin
commission."
The Sterling, Bohemia, Santa Clara and
Centennial are splendiu vessels of their
ciass. They are built of oak and are now
almost as good as the day they were
launched. Between now and the next
Beason in Bering Sea they will be em
ployed on ihe coast, but as soon as the
canneries open they will be put in com
mission and take supplies and men north.
In this way the Aiaska Packers' Associa
tion and the Alaska Improvement Com
pany expect to pay for their ships inside
of two years by the charter money that
they will save.
POLICE AND THE CHARTER.
A Circular Letter Sent to Members of
thÂ© Force.
The Citizens' Charter Association has
sent to every policeman in the City a long
circular letter explaining the proposed
new charter where it reiates in any way to
the Police Department and the members
thereof.
Relating to the tenure of office the
letter quotes : "The membeis of the police
force in service at the time this charter
goes into effect shall constitute such
police force." Therefore members will be
permanently retained under civil service
rules and reflations, and no power can
remove tbera from their positions as long
as they fiiitbfully perform their duties.
The letter further calls attention to the
fact that pensions and relief and funds
for the same and the salaries are practi
cally the same as now existing. In con
clusion the letter says: "The change in
the method of nppomting Commissioners
from their life tenure to appointment for
fonr years by the Mayor will in no way
endanger the stability of the Police De
partment The charter expressly places
the Police Department under civil service
rules and regulations, and you are in
every way secured and protected by us
carefully drawn provisions. Every mem
ber oi the Police Department of San Fran
cisco should therefore favor and vote for
the proposed new charter."

DIMOND REPLIES
TO MR. PHELAN
Denounces as False the
Story That He Favors
the Charter.
Declares That From Its Very
Inception He Was Opposed
to It
FBOUD OF HIS PEIVATE IIFE
He Calls Attention to Rumors About
Mr. Phelan's Club Life and
Utterances.
Joseph L Dimond, Mr. Buckley's can
didate for Mayor, has written the follow
ing open letter to James D. Pheian, Mr.
Rainey's candidate for Mayor:
To James D. Pheian, Candidate for Mayorâ
DeaeSir: In the Examiner 01 the 16th inst.
you are reported to have made a public speech
the night preceding-, in which, referring to
me and my candidacy, you said: "Moreover,
1 know that this same candidate within lour
weeks declared that he was lavoraDle to the
charter. Tne present pretense that a vote for
him is a vote against the charter is a political
trick unworthy of any candidate."
I assume that your speech was correctly re
ported, because I ani informed by reliable par
ties that you have heretofore made the same
statements in private. I regret very much
tnat you should deem it fit to make such a
charge. I had hoped that the campaign, as
iar as the candidates for the Mayoralty were
concerned, would be conducted on honorable
lines and without resort to falsehood or mud
elinging.
The statement that you know that within
lour weeks, or at any "other time, I declared
myself favorable to the charter, is absolutely
and unqualifiedly false. I never did declare
myself in favor of the new charter; hence
neither you nor any other person knows or can
know that I so declared myself. I have been
opposed to the new charter ever since it left
the hands of the Freeholders "and any state
ment to the contrary is untrue.
I do not object to you and your friends pub
lishing of and concerning me the truth. 1
am willing that my private life, trom the day
of my birtn to the present time, and my pub
lic career be subjected to the closest scrutiny.
1 will not object to any reference by you, or
any other person, to any act or declaration of
mine in my private life or public station. I
think every candidate for public office should
be judged by the character of his private life,
his course of conduct, his acts and utterances
as a private citizen, and if he has had experi
ence as a public official, by his conduct in
office. If hereafter you and your friends re
sort to falsehood in referring to me, or my
candidacy, I will not retort in Kind..
1 have heard of many slanders emanating
from friends of yours, if not from yourself,
which have been circulated in quarters where
it was supposed they would do the most good
and which might have prompted counter at
tacks upon you, but I disdain to use p2rsonali
ties for the purpose of securing my election or
accomplishing your defeat.
Many rumors have been conveyed to me
concerning your private life, your club life
and alleged utterances of yours which,
Mr. and Mrs. Frank "Wratten (nee
" Flynn), Who } Were Wedded
Last Night*
whether well or ill founded, would tend to
Injure your standing in this commnnity. But
I linve always and persistently refusÂ»d, and
will refuse, to give them circulation, and have
advised, and will continue to advise, my
friends not tÂ» circulate such rumors. Of you,
all that. I aslt in return is that you confine
yourself to the truth la any future reference
to me.
You seem to think, and have stated, that a
vote for you is not a vote in favor of the new
charter, and that a vote for me is not a vote
against the objectionable instrument. I
honestly differ with you. I think that any
voter who casts his ballot for you indorses
your views on and your advocacy of the new
charter. There is a principle at stake
in the election of the Mayor which is analogous
to the principle at stake in the election of the
President of the United States. What would
the people think of the citizen who proclaims
himselfin favorof William McKinley for Presi
dent and at the same time asserts that he fav
ors the free and unlimited coinage ol silver and
gold at the ratio of Hi to 1? or of the citizen
who says he intends to vote for William J.
Bryan, although in favor of the gold standard?
The anoiogy is perfect. The President cannot
enact the Inw3 necessary to change the present
monetary system. Congress alone has that
power.
In your public speeches, you say that the is
sues involved in the election of Mayor and
those involved in the adoption or rejection of
the charter are distinct and separate. They
are not. If the election determined finally the
adoption or rejection of the charter, your
claim mieht go unchallenged; bnt the charter
does nut become the organic law of this muni
cipality upon its adoption by the voters of Fan
Francisco. It must after adoption be ratified

by the Legislature. Are the opponents of the
new charter so blind that they cannot see that
it is to their interest to elect a Mayor who is
also opposed to the charter.
If you are elected I presume that all tne in
fluence at your command as Mayor of Sitn
Francisco will be exerted to secure the ratifi
cation by the Legislature of your cherished
charter, although in your opinion it Is in part
unconstitutional, and although when you
qualify as Mayor you will solemnly swear ''to
support the constitution of the State of Cali

darter run the rist of placing in the office of
M*yof a known friend and advocate of the
charter, who, in the event of his election, will
directly and indirectly control 3000 appoint
ments and thereby exert a mighty in
fluence to secure legislative ratification.
1 think it is a dangerous risk. I
think it no political trick for the opponents of
the new charier to claim that a vote for you is
a voie in favorof ihe charter and that a vote
for me is against it. lam net resorting to po
litical tricks to secure my election. I think
my conduct durinu this campaign contrasts

WON AND WED A SINGER
Frank L. Wratten of the Mar
ket-Street Road United to
Miss Millie Flynn.
The Popular Church Vocalist's Ro
manceâTrinity's Soprano Gives
Her Hand and Heart.
Last evening at 9 o'clock, at the resi
dence of Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Flynn, on
Twelfth street, Miss Millie Flynn and
Frank L. Wratten were married in the
presence of a small company.-
There is a pretty little romance attached
to the union of this young couple that
makes it an affair deserving of* more tnan
passing notice. Miss Flynn is one of the
most popular of the small army of young
women that constitute the choir singers
of this City. For many years she has oc
cupied the position of soprano in the
Trinity Church choir, and is also the
soprano of the quartet choir at the Taylor
street synagogue.
Possessed of bright and charming man
ners and a delightful personality, the fair
young singer lacked not for suitors. But
music occupied her mind and heart, and
her admirers sighed in vain.
Then she met young Wratten, an hum
ble attache of the Market-street road.
The handsome face of the conductor and
his sterling manly qualities captured the
heart of the singer, and witn her heart
went her hand. The wedding last even
ing was conducted simply and unostenta
tiously.
The bride's associates in the Trinity
choir decorated the parlors of her resi
dence with flowersl and delicate ferns.
At 9 o'clock, to the bridal chorus from
"Lohengrin," chanted by Mrs. J. D. Sib
ley, Mis 3 Olive Reed and Miss Maud
Bumeschien, the bridal party entered and
took np their station before the Rev. Mr.
Radcr, who pronounced the young couple
man and wife.
The bride looked charming in a gown of
white brocaded satin, trimmed with chif
fon and pearl passementerie. She was at
tended by Miss Miriam Coney, who
officiated as maid of honor, and Miss Ju
liette Grenir.ger and Miss Leo Wefelsburg,
who acted as bridesmaids. James Mad
docks was best man.
Mr. and Mrs. Wratten have gone south
for a bridal tour, and on their return will
occupy their new home, 233 Thirteenth
street.
THE DIVORCE COURTS.
Unhappy Couples Whose Boudi Were
Judicially Severed.
Judge Hebbard yesterday annulled the
marriace contract between J. C. Collins
and Katie J. Collins. The parties were
married in 1879 and in 1887 the wife was
committed to the insane asylum at Nat>a.
The marriage was annulled on the ground
that the wife was insane at the time of; the
wedding.
Juilire Seawell has modified the decree
of divorce in the suit of Joseph Woods
against WUhelniina E. J. Woods. He
allowed the wife to retain control of the
children and ordered that the husband
have the home of the couple, on Ashly
avenue, Berkeley, to do with as he wished.
Judge Murphy granted a divorce to
Joseph B. Oberlw from Teresa Oberle, be
cause of the tatter's habitual intemper
ance, and to Rose McGinn from E. G. Mc-
Ginn, on the ground of extreme cruelty.
Elizabeth M. Christensen was freed from
the cruelty of Autone Christeusen by
Judge Sanderson.

Was Menaced by
Greater Danger.

MR. BRYAN AKD THAT PANIC.
Talks of a Fearful Disaster as
Lightly as if About
Sneezing.
"The lower place is filled.gentlemen, the
lower place is filled," cried the perspiring
ushers at the Auditorium long before the
hour for the introduction of the speakers
last evening. And so, too, was the gal-
Jery, the stage, the inclosure for the or
chestra, every square foot where a chair
could be placed. The occasion was the
grand rally planned by the United Rail
road Republican Club.
The chairman, W. C. Carpenter, in call
ing the big meeting to order and prelim
inary to the introduction of General
Barnes said that six weeks ago the United
Railroad Republican Club had held one of
the biggest gatherings that had ever taken
place in this City as an organizer. At that
time the membership was 1200. Now the
membership was 1700, the largest political
club on this coast. General Barnes being
introduced was met with cheers and ap
plause.
The speaker in answer said he was glad
to have a chance to tell the men who had
so often ran away from him when hailing
them from the sidewalk or who refused to
stop when, on the car, he begged them to,
just what he thought of them as a body.
[Laughter.]
"But first," he said, "I want to know
whether or not I am talking to free men
or to slaves. If we are to believe the daily
utterances of a morning paper all of you
are mere bondsmen; that a corporation
dictates to you what you shall do with
your franchise. Senator White, too, is go
me about over the State telling a story that
brings tears to his voice of how a railroad
man came to him and told him that he
had been asked to wear a McKinley but
ton; that he had advised him not to; that
he came again next day saying he had
been asked to join a McKinley club; Sen
ator White advised him not to join it ; the
man came back next day and sahi he
would have to join the club or lose his
job, and Stephen said to him: 'Don't
lose your job. When you go into the little
booth that is prepared for your safety,
where you are only seen by your God,
whom you do not fear, and where your
employer, whom you do fear, cannot see
you, you can vote for Mr. Bryan.' And
the man went away, his heart swelling
with the thought of how he would redeem
himself by representing himself to be
what be was not.
"Well," said the speaker, "I would
rather live under the government of a
Czar, with the prospect of a walk to the
bleak wilderness of Siberia and to die
than live under an alleged democracy
where the freemen were compelled to re
sort to or who will resort to such miser
able cowardice at thedictation of anybody.
"Two weeks hence and the great ques
tion that is stirring this country will be
settled and poor Willie Weary Waggles
Bryan may go home and rest his jaw."
The speaker referred to the Chicago
convention as not being representative
of the Democratic party. The Demo
cratic party, he said, had some sense; the
Chicaeo convention showed none. The
nominee and the platform were both
freaks â nothing had ever been seen like
either in the political history of this
country before. Only tnree papers in the
English language in the United States ad
vocates them. One is the Examiner of
San Francisco,- another the Journal ol
New York, both owned . by William
Hearst. The other is a newspaper 01
Deiroit. Of the 593 German papers in this
country only eleven advocate Brvun and
16 to 1.
"How can this man succeed with all the
great newspapers, representing the in
telligence of this country, against him?
I wonder if this man, who is roaruing
through the country yelling at every
water-tank along the road, can eat a meal
or kiss that pretty wife of his at any other
ratio than that of 16 to 1? Yes, the old
Democratic party had some brains at
least. There are a good many things that
we do not like about Mr. Cleveland. We
do not like his tinkering with the revenue
laws and as a result of that blunder an
accumulation of debt, contracted in peace,
equal to the cost of the Revolutionary War ;
the War of 1812 and the Mexican War com
bined. We don't like that, but the Dem
ocratic party did that, and now the Dem
ocratic party refuses to say a word of
praise for their President â leaving it to
his predecessor, General* Harrison [ap
plause] to point out that he is the only
man in the party who had force and
influence enough to carry the party into
power."
The speaker ran through the story of
American finances. "We have tried and
ampled them all," he said. "We know
what is and what is not money. We have
tried gold and silver and copper and fiat
money and promises to pay â that Bob In
gersoll says is Lno more money than is a
bill of fare a square meal."
He told how Jackson â the apple of the
eye of the Democracy â demonetized silver
without anybody saying anything about
it. He said the war cost a billion dollars
more under our fiat money than it would
have done on a sound money basis. The
country has cleared off that tremendous
debt in a great measure, and in the
midst of our prosperity comes this
conspiracy of the silver- mine owners.
They began to yell about the crime of '73
â the order to stop coining a coin that
hadn't been coined for thirty years. There
is $45,000,000 of silver in the. 'Mint in San
Francisco. I asked John Daggett why he
didn't pay it out. He answered, "if you
will tell me how, we will pay you a good
sum." I asked what would be done when
the mints turned out nothing but silver,
and I will not repeat the profane thir.gs he
said in answer. He indicated, however,
that the country would go where potatoes
do not freeze.
The speaker referred to Bryan's admis
sion in Chicago that a panic would follow
the adoption of free silver. "He speaks of
a panic as lightly as if he spoke of sneez
ing. Do you remember that Black Fri
day, when in one day this country lost
more than the great cost of the Rebellionâ
in one day's panic? What will you do
with a man like that? If he is to prevail,
we might as well stop education, burn
down our churches and our schools,"
He said he did not believe that he would
prevail, and in an earnest and beautiful
peroration he called upon every Repub
lican to get into the ranks and do his
duty. When the speaker concluded the
audience refused to move, but sat and ap
plauded for five minutes, the sound dying
away and rolling up again, until ha reap
peared on the stage and invited them all
10 come back to the tame place on election
night and "hear from the returns the fate
of our country, for not since Sumpter waa
fired upon has it been menaced by such
danger."

A REPRESENTATIVE MAN
The Republican Candidate for
Senator From the Nine
teenth District
Safe and Conservative to Guard the
Interests of All His Constitu
ents Impartially.
John T. Dare, regular Republican can
didate for State Senator from the Nine
teenth Senatorial District, comprising tl.e
Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth Assembly
districts, returned yesterday from a very
successful campaign tour in the interior.
Mr. Dare was obliged to return very
much against his inclination and against
the wish of Chairman McLaughlin and
Secretary Higgins of the State Central
Committee, because it was imperatively
necessary for him to make a campaign for
himself in his district.
On his iour he spoke at the principal
places in Glenn, Butte, Humas, Alameda
and Solano counties, from all of which
places there came to the State Central
Committee the most flattering eulogiums
of Mr. Dare's work. Wherever he went
he observed public sentiment very keenly,
and he found that the drift of it had been

steadily going for McKinlev for the past
six weeks. Away up in Pluraas he found
that protection was the great issue npon
which the thouchts of the people were
concentrated, and in the foothills, the
homes of the gold-miner, the woolgrower
and the stock-raiser, the sentiment was
equally strong for the protection of Amer
ican industries and American labor.
Mr. Dare is the strongest man that
could have been nominatt-d for the State
Senate in his district. He is a gentleman
of refinement, intelligence and education
and practical experience as a legislator;
in short, a safe, conservative, patriotic
citizen, in whom the merchant and Jaborer
alike may have implicit confidence. He
is a man Qualified in every respect to rep
resent the intelligence and the highest
citizenship of his constituentsâmer
chants, mechanics and laborersâ for he la
essentially a plain man of the people and
a typical American of the good kind.
It is not a question of his election at all.
It is simply a question as to the size of
the majority that his constituents will roll
up for him on the 3d of November.
A Choice of Candidates.
The Thirty-first Assembly District Re

MR. BRYAN AND
THE ITALIANS
Denial of the Story Re
cently Published in
Chicago.
Judge Maguire Gives Some His
tory of Congressional
Proceedings.
GOVERNMENT BY INJUNCTION.
Argument in Favor of a Much-Dis
cussed Plank in the Chic: go
Platform.
Judge J. G. Maguire, Democratic nomi
nee for Congress in tne Fourth Congres
sional District, addressed a meeting of
Democrats at Bersaglieri Hall, corner of
Stockton and Union streets, iast evening.
The regulation bonfire flashed in front
of the hall, and, as usual, there were nags
and pictures of W. J. Bryan in every con
venient place.
The following officers were announced:
President, T. Bacigalupi; vice-presidents â
Q. Pescia, G. A. Devoto, L. D. Bacigalupi,
T. Rottanzi, T. A. Spinetti, T. F. Cavag
naro, C. O. Fanda, Z. Ravenna, A. Nar
dini, F. Cavacnaro, E. Daneri, C. Dondero,
D. Devincenzi, A. Codeglia, J. E. Oagiieri.
L. Bianchi acted as secretary.
T. Bacigalupi called the meeting to or
der and introduced W. H. Alford, chair
man of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, as the English-speaking president
of the day.
Mr. Alford read a telegram from ex-
Congressman Caminetti asking him to
denounce the lie that was beine circulated
against Mr. Bryan to the effect that he
abused Italians on account of their
nationality.
J. A. Devoto took up the subject of Mr.
Bryan's alleged abuse of the Italians. He
admitted that the Omaha paper with
which Mr. Bryan was connected did say
something disparaging concerning Ital
ians. The paper said they were no better
than Chinamen ; that they were a class of
anarchists and dynamiter?. But Mr. De
voto contended that Mr. Bryan had noth
ing to do with tbose expressions.
Having disposed of the story from
Omaha Mr. Devoto gave up thp remainder
of bis remarks to the silver question.
Judge Maguire was introduced and was
warmly greeted by the audience. He said
that in public life, as in private life, he
stauds for the manhood of the country ; not
for any of the accidents of wealth and po
sition, but for the man himself; not for
the corporations, but for the people, de
manding equal opportunities for all and
declaring that there shall be special privi
leges for none.
"My position is such that I must there
fore appeal to the men of the country, and
so I come to you, for you must know that
I have no mighty corporations or other
associations of capital behind me,' : said
the speaker.
In giving a refutation to the story about
Mr. Bryan, Judge Maguire said that he
served in Congress with Mr. Bryan, and
that his expressions in regard to the Ital
ians were favorable, and, in fact, coincided
with those of Judge Maguire himself.
When a bill was before Congress, having
in view the exclusion of a great many
Italians, and particularly directed against
the majority of the Italians, Judge Ma
guire said that he as a member of the
Committee on Immigration opposed those
sweeping provisions. He consented to
the exclusion of vagrants and criminals
of every nationality, but he stoutly con
tended that the honest and industrious
countrymen of Christopher Columbus and
Americus Vespuci, who gave this magnifi
cent continent to the world, ought to be
welcomed to this country.
Speaking of the scheme to refund the
Pacific railroad debts, Judge Maguire de
clared that at one time it looked as if the
railroad people were about to defeat the
representatives of the Pacific Coast, and
in their dire distress be and others called
on Mr. Bryan, beseeching him to help
them. With half an hour's preparation
Mr. Bryan made a speech which, Judge
Maguire declared, saved the day for tne
enemies of the funding bill. He said that
if Bryan is elected the funding bill will
never be heard of again.
Touching government by injunction,
which is condemned in the Democratic
National platform, Judge Maguire paid
his respects to Judge Jenkins of the
United States Circuit Court in Ohio. He
said that Judge Jenkins was sent to Wis
consin to make a law which no Legisla
ture and no Congress would ever make.
Judge Jenkins issued an injunction for
bidding any person from quitting the em
ploy of a certain railroad either with or
without notice, and when some of the
men, exercising their right as citizens of a
free country, did quit, Judge Jenkins had
them arrested and turned them over to
the officers of his own court for punish
ment. These men demanded a trial by
jury, but this was refused. If they had
broken a law made by Congress they
would have a right to trial by jury; a
right that none could deny. But when
they violated a law made by Judge Jenk
ins alone they lost their right to jury
trial.
M. M. Estee, W. H. L. Barnes and
Irving M. Scott were criticized lor chang
ing their views on the silver question.
Ben Butterworth, who wrote a pro-silver
letter to Senator Teller last March and
who is talking for gold now, was also held
up to ridicule.
Judge Maguire dwelt at considerable
length on the silver question. He said
that it was not fair to allege that Mexico
and China are to be judged as silver
standard countries, because the peons and
coolies of those countries have not the ivÂ«
telligence and the political power to pro
tect themselves.
F. Cavagnaro made an address in
Italian, arousing considerable enthusiasm.
Colonel Osborne Is Happy.
Colonel H. L. Osborne of Los Angeles
came to this City to-day with most en
couraging reports of RepuDlican succoss
in his district. He ascertained that the
statements that many Republicans had
been affected by the silver craze wrre un
founded, and that the Republicans of Los
Angeles County were as loyal to the party
and to its glorious principles as are the
Republicans of any other part of the
State.
The colonel joyfully predicts the
triumph of McKtnley and protection in the
land of the oiange and the cactus.
Will Support W. A. Deane.
A new club was organized last evening
on Sutter street and Central avenue in the
interest of William A. Deane. Over 200
were present. They warmly supported
the candidate for the office of Auditor.
The officers elected were: William Mas
sett, president; George Lake, vice-presi

BUCKLEY CALLED TO TIME.
A Furniture Dealer's Sn!t Against the
Blind Boss and Others.
Suit was filed in the Justice's Court yes
terday by George Malcolm, wood-carver
for the San Francisco Furniture Manufact
uring Company, against C. A. Buckley,
John McCarthy, James H. O'Brien. Dr. J.
J. Stanton, E. T. Mills ami twelve defend
ants Doe for the sum of $101.
During the days of the old Occidental
Club, of which McCarthy was president, it
seems that certain furniture in tne club's
rooms was repaired or exchanged and the
bill was never paid, owinjr .to the fact that
the responsibility of the debt could not be
fixed. Hence the suit.
His Leg Fractured.
John Stewart, a boy 9 years of age, living at
8 Louisa street, was standing in front of Union
Hall r on Howard street,- between Third and
Fourth, last nigrht along with a crowd of other
boys, watching the crowd gathering to hear
the political speakers, when a cable-car came
along and knocked him down. He was taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where Dr. Maher
found that his left leg was fractured below the
knee. John is unfortunate, as his right leg
was broken about two years ago.

pictures of the pig the action of the food

NEW TO-DAf.
WHY LADIES LIKE COFFEE.
Though Many Admit It Hurts Them.
Many ladies have so great a liking for
coffee for breakfast that the meal seems
flat and unsavory without it, but the
muddy complexion, which is almost a sure
accompaniment, is a great trial, and tne
question is seriously discussed many and
many times over in one's mind whether it
is possible to give over the coffee and
gradually get back the lost complexion,
or keep on with the coffee and get on with
the bad skin and make the best of it.
The disordered stomacn and liver some-
times bring on more serious troubles. To
quit the use of coffee is tbe only true relief,
it contains the same poisonous alkaloids
as tobacco, strychnine and morphine, al-
t hough less in volume. One can use the
delicious bot food-drink, PoÃtuni Cereal,
at meals and never miss the coffee. It
browns the deep seal-brown of Mocha
and takes on the rich volden brown of old
Java when cream is added. It is made by
the Posuim Cereal Co. Lim. of Battle Creek,
Michigan, purely and wholly of tbe nour-
ishing grains intended by the Creator for
man's subsistence. Tne pungent taste so
well iiiced in strong coffee is retained in
Postum.
Nature quickly recovers when coffee is
left off and the natural health coffee is
used in its place. Healthful sleep is again
enjoyed and nerves, stomach, liver, bowels
and heart cease their complaining when
the disturbing cause is withdrawn.
These are great big live facts worthy the
attention of any one who cares for the ex-
quisite fun ol being perfectly well.
Beware of the fraudulent imitations of
the original Postum Cereal Grain coffee.
Insist on Postum.
