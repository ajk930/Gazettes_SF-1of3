STRANGE CRAFT OF THE SKY
Sacramento Men Describe
the Airship.
Claim They Saw Its Occupants and
Heard Them in Convex
sation.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 18.â The one
topic of conversation in this city to-day has
been tlie reported appenrance of an airship
over the eastern portion of Sacramento
last night. While there are hundreds
of peopie who, failing to catch a glimpse
of this mysterious visitant, are extremely
skeptical, there are hundreds of others
who are positive in their declaration that
they did see its brilliant searchlight trav
eling over the city, and who will also
swear that they heard the voices of its
occupants and distinguished their merry
song and laughter. Tnen t'.iere are others
who declare that these aerial travelers
used the Englisn tongue, and that they
plainly distinguished the words used and
commands uttered for the guidance and
care of the air vessel.
In investigating this mysterious visita
tion the local representative of The Call
obtained personal interviews with scores
of reputable citizens who reside along the
route passed over by the air craft. Many
of them lived fully a mile or two distant
from each other, but their accounts ali
agree.
. As far as can be learned from eye
witnesses, the body of the craft was ob-
Jong and eeg-shapud, with fan-like wheels
on either side, whose rapid revolutions,
beating the air, served to propel the vessel
directly against the wind, and in so doing
caused the vessel to sway from side to
pide with a wavering motion, similar to
that of a boat being forced against the
rapid current of a stream.
Midway of the vessel and suspended
directly beneath it was a brilliant search
light about twice the size of an arc light,
evidently so placed that the occupants
could ascertain when the vessel ap
proached too near tne earth and was in
danger of collision with lofty objects.
Above the ecg-shapad body towered a tail,
indistinguishable mass, whose shape it
was impossible to ascertain, owiup to the
fact that the onlooker's eyes were blurred
by the brilliancy of the searchlight.
Such is the description of the vessel
given by R. L. Lowry, who also claims to
have been able to distinguish four men,
who were seemingly engaged in propelling
the vessel by its fanlike wheel?, much
after the fashion of a bicyclist driving his
wheel over a boulevard. It is also claimed
that a bys:ander in the vicinity of Mr.
Lowry shouted to the men in the aerial
vessel and inquired their destination, and
that they replied they were bound for San
Francisco and intended arriving by 12
o'clockâ midnight. This, however, could
not be verified, as no one appeared to
know the name of the reputed inter
rogator.
J. H. Vogel, who claimed to have been
in the same locality, also states that the
vessel was egg-shaped, and that he dis
tinctly heard the voices of its occupants,
but says that as the vessel was rapidly
rising he was unable to distinguish any
word*, and that after a brief slimp3e of
the body of the airship it faded from view
and all that was visible was the brilliant
searchlight, winch moved siowly away in
. a southwesterly direction, going toward
San Francisco, and being visible for up
ward of thirty minutes, growing more and
more dim, until it disappeared in the dis
tance.
E. Wenzel, who is employed at Scheld's
Brewery, verifies the stories of Vogel and
Lowry as to the shape of the vessel, but
claims that when it passed over him the
occupants were trolling a merry choru ,
which, though distant, sounded sweet and
clear in the evening air.
The first person who, as far as can be
learned, caught a glimpse of the reputed
airship was David Carl, a horse-trainer at
Agricultural Park. When he first caught
Bight of the craft it was within a short
distance of the ground, and he states that
he heard a voice saying:
"We are too low down here; send her
up higher."
Then a discussion followed as to the ad
visability of attaining too great a Height,
as the occupants were evidently anxious
to reach San Francisco before midnight.
He stated that the vessel then started to
rise, doing so on an incline and not
roing directly up as would be the case had
ballast been cast from a balloon. He had
no, idea, however, that it was anything
but a balloon and had never even thought
of the possibility of an airship. Hs was
positive in his declaration that it con
tained at least two occupants, as he could
clearly distinguish two voices discuss, iv
the strata of air best adapted for rapid
traveling.
T. P. de Long when interviewed said:
"I could not distinguish the shape of tfce
vessel. All I could see was a brilliant
light moving seemingly against the wind,
but I could plainly bear the voices of its
occupants, who were singing, and it
sounded to me like the noise produced by
a phonograph. At this time I should
judge the vessel was several hundred feet
high."
Frank Ross, assistant superintendent of
, the electric streetcar system, when mter-
I viewed said: "I did not see the form of
the vessel nor did I hear the voices of its
occupants, as I was not informed until it
had passed my residence. All that I saw
was a brilliant electric searchlight, ap
parently twice the size and power of an
ordinary arc lieht, which was being pro
pelled through the air by some mysterious
The San Francisco Call
fore c. From what I have learned from
my employesâ men of undoubted veracity
âI am certain that this can by no possi
bility have been a 'fake,' but that a gen
uine airship passed over the city last
evening. I watched the light until it
passed oat of sicht thirty minutes later.
It was traveling unevenly toward the
southwest, dropping now nearer to the
earth and now suddenly rising into the
air again as it the force that was whirling
it through space was sensible of the
danger of collision with objects upon the
earth. I, of course, have no idea as to its
destination or purpose. I can only say
that 1 am fully convinced by what I have
heard that it was something out of the
ordinary."
G. C. Snyder. foreman of the streetcar
barn, states: "I am fully convinced that
an aerial vessel of some description passed
over this building last night about 6:30
o'clock. At the time my attention was
called to it the craft was at too great an
elevation for me to distinguish its form,
but I distinctly saw the searchlight,
which was goins directly into the wind,
and from its movement judged that it was
attached to a vessel of some description,
which was laboring as a seagoing vessel
will in a he:ivy spa and head wind. 1
also find that hundreds of the residents
in this portion of the city saw the light,
and there are hundreds whe claim that
they heard the voices of the occupants of
the visitor."
CharlesLv.sk, secretary of the company,
also states thai he saw the light traveling
over the city.
Mayor Hubbard says that personally he
failed to catch a gfimpse Kil this aerial
visitant, as he was engaged in his office
downtown when it passed over, buc he
stated to The Call representative that
upon arriving at his residence in the up
per portion of the city his daughter told
him that she hai seen a brilliant white
light, seemingly at a great elevation,
which had come toward me city from the
east and paired directly over it. moving
in a southwesterly direction. She sÂ»Â£d if
certainly was not a meteor, as it was a
different shade of Hunt and moved too
siowly and unevenly, and she was at a
loss to account for it.
F. E. Eriggs, a laotorraan on one of the
streetcars running to Oak Park, saw the
light of the traveling airship, and at the
request of the occupants of his crowded
vehicle he stopped his car for a moment.
He says that while they could not discern
the form of the airship, yet the voices of
the occupants were plainly heard. He
had been informed by a man who resided
in the vicinity of Ea.-t Park, where the air
vessel had Deen first teen, that it was a
genuine airship, cigar or egg shaped, and
that it had at least four occupants. When
the vessel passed over his car he judged
that the occupants were singing, but they
were at such a height that neither he nor
his passengers were enabled to distinguish
the words or the tune, as they came in
broken snatches, as though borne on gusts
of the night wind.
When H. W. Marsh saw the traveling
light it was at least five miles away. He
thought that it was attached to some
aerial vessel, owing to its wavering mo
tion through the atmosphere.
E. Caverly saw the light, but refused to
be interviewed on the subject, evidently
deeming it to be uncanny.
M. T. Shelly, a gentleman of undoubted
veracity, saw the airship's i-ipht. and at
one time, when the craft careened some
what so as to partially sbscure the light,
he caught sight of the vessel itself, which
he declared to be a cigar-shaped recep
ticle, with what seemed to be a dark wall
above it.
Hundred* of similar interviews could be
obtained. In this connection the Evening
Bee publishes the following account:
Startled citizens last night living at
points of the city along a rough diagonal
line, yet far distant from each other, de
clare that they not only saw the phenome
non but they also heard voices issuing
from it in midair â not the whispering of
angels, not the sepulchral mutterings of
evil spirits, but the intelligible words and
the merry laughter of humans. At those
intervals where the glittering object, as if
careless of its obligation to maintain a
straightforward course, descended dan
gerously near the housetops voices were
heard in the sky saying:
" ; Lift her up, quick; you are making
directly for that steeple.'
"Then the light in the Bky would be
seen obeying some mystic touch and as
cending to a considerable height, from
which it would take up again its south
westerly course. The light sailed along
the line of X street, so it appeared from
those in the eastern part of the city,
although it appears that after it had
pa.Â«sad Fourteenth street it was wafted far
south of K. Laughter and words sound
ing strance in the distance, though fairly
intelligible, fell upon the ears of pedes
trians along the course or the light who
had paused to look up at the novelty.
"Last night's Bee contained a. (eiegram
from New York announcing that a mnn
h;>d perfected nn airship and would on
Friday of this weeK, accompanied by one
or two friends, ascend from a vacant lot in
the metropolis and po directly to Calilor-
Dia, which he promised to reach In two
days. The description furnished in the
telegram included an apparatus which was
electrical, to supply light and power for
the astonishing contrivance.
"It is not regarded a3 lifcely, in view of
the announcement contained in the dis
patch, that last night Sacramento was
overswept by this aerial ship.
"But here is the incidentâ here the
chronicle of words heard, of v strange

spectacle witnessed. Whence the light,
which was not a meteor all agree, came,
whither it went, where it now is â these
things it is not within the capacity of this
article to deal with."
Then follow interviews similar to those
obtained by The Call representative.
Among the eye-witnesses of last night's
singular spectacle the wildest speculations
are rife. As to the destination and object
to be obtained by this night voyage of a
reputed airship, one of these onlookers in
formed The Call representative that in
his opinion it w.is the same invention
which it is rumored Edison claimed to
have perfected and offered to the Govern
ment at the time when the Venezuelan
boundary question came up, and that now
that relations were strained with Spain
the Government has sent a party of engi
neers out in the airship to test its practi
cability, and that they were keeping away
from populous localities, except during
the night trips.
The opinion of the masses is, however,
that some Jucky inventor, having solved
the mystery of aerial navigation, is, with
his companions, testing his invention in
secret, with no intent of allowing a ctirious
public to view it until his rights are fully
protected by letters patent. Tbey pre
sume tnat he is traveling by night and
laying by in desert spots during the day.
Be that as it may, there can be no possible
doubt thai an aerial vessel of some kind
passed over Sacramento last night, and
hundreds of the residents of this city will
so testify.
The residents of Oak Park claim to have
a little mystery of their own which may
possible bearing of this subject. They
state that yesterday afternoon an object
was se6n in the sky at such a great eleva
tion aÂ« to be almost indistinguishable. It
moved slowly in a circle, leaving a volume
of smoke behind it. This phenomenon
was seen by many, who are unable to ac
count for it.
A rumor is afloat in the city to-night
that the airship was constructed near this
city and that a trial trip was attempted
last evening, a cable being used to confine
the machine to a certain elevation.
It is stated that the cable parted and the
vessel then drifted over the city and be
came the observed of all observers. Tliis
rumor cannot be confirmed at this late
hour, but it is claimed that T. Allen, who
formerly conducted an employment olfice
in this city, s-tates that s'ich is the
case and that one of the men who
had made tho ascension had informed him
that the trial was a success and the vessel
worked well, exesptthat it was impossible
to fully control its movements. In conse
quence the inventors had, after going
toward San Francisco aways, returned
and landed in a vacant field some distance
from Arcade and about six miles from
the city limits. This tale is not generally
credited.
SEEN THREE WEEKS AGO.
Story Told by a Hunt-r l.irino on Bo-
Unas Miidgr.
On Sunday, the first day of this month,
a representative of The Call met on Bo
linas Ridge, just to the west of Mount
Tamnlpais, an old hunter living there,
named Brown. The old man was very
nervous and started a conversation im
mediately by asking:
"Do I look like a crazy man?"
"Why certainly not, Mr. Brown. Why
do you ask?"
"Well," he replied," "I don't expect
anybody to believe me. To tell t!>e
truth I can hardly believe myself. 15m
it's an honest fact that yesterday morn
ing, when the fog began to lift, I saw an
airship right up there a couple of hundred
feet over them pines.
"No, I can't tell you much what she
looked like. She didn't show very plainly
through the mist, but I saw a large, dark
shape with something moving on it. Don't
know whether I saw any people or not.
It came on me so sudden I was almost
stunned, and by the time I collected my
senses she was out of sight.
"I have been kind of dazed ever since,
and to have you ten me that I don't iook
crazy is a great relief. But I kuow that
what I saw was an airship."
As the "superior" type of mirage is not
uncommon to people living on the Marin
hills it was thought that this was what
the old man had seen, so no attention was
paid to nis story. The mirage effect of a
large ocean vessel passing through the sky
might appear to him like some new
fangled machine for navieating the air.
Perhaps the mirage is what he really
saw, but in the face of the stories circu
lated in regard to the airship there is a
probability that in what Mr. Brown really

LOST ON THE
IRISH COAST
British Steamer Memphis
Guided to Destruction
During a Fog.
Ten of the Passengers and Crew
Losa Their Lives in a
Heavy Sea*
Drenched by Hi?h Waves, Some Fali
From Their Stations in the
Ringing.
:*><.-
LONDON, Ejcg., Nov. 18.â The British
steamer Memphis, Captain Williams,
which sailed from Montreal on November
4 for Bristol, was wrecked in Dunlough
Bay. near Mizzenhead, on the south coast
of Ireland, last night and ten of those on
board of her lost their lives. The Mem
phis struck at lOo'clock, during the preva
lence of a dense fog. At the time of the
accident the steamer was proceeding cau
tiously, blowing her whistle continuously
and keeping a sharp lookout for the Miz
zenhead and lsrowh?ad lights, which the
thiCKness of the weather prevented her
from making out.
As soon as she struck the rocks the ves
sel began to fill and rockets were immedi
ately fired for the purpose of summoning
assistance from the shore. Three of the
ship' 3 boats were quickly launched, tut
i one of them was shattered by being dashed
: against the side of the steamer and two of
. the occupants were drowned.
The others succeeded in reaching the
' rocks along the shore, but tive were
: washed away and drowned, iheir compan
| ions being unable to render them the
i slightest assistance.
Those of the crew who had taken to the
I rigging soon after the steamer struck ex
! perienced an awful night. They were
I constantly drenched by the heavy seas
I which washed over them, and some of
j them, after hard fighting for their lives,
{dropped from their places and were car
i ried away.
The rockets sent up by the steamer's
crew were seen by the coast guard, but the
latter were unable to communicate with
the shipwrecked men until after daybreak,
when all who remained in the rigging
were taken off by means of a line con
veyed to the steamer by the rocket appa
ratus of the life-savers. The rescued per
sons immediately upon reaching the shore
were taken to various farmhouses in the
vicinity, where they were kindly cared for
by the inmates.
Many of them were almost naked, but
wee supplied with sufficient clothing to
enable them to proceed to Crookhaven, at
which p ace most of them now are.
The sceamer is a total wrsck and much
of her cargo is Deing washed ashore. The
coast guard are engaged in the work of
saivage. AH the survivors pay a high
tribute to Captain Williams for his efforts
to secure the safety of those on board the
vessel.
The Memphis was 3191 tons register, 345
feet long, 41 feet beam and 26 feet depth
of hold. She was built at Beliast, Ireland,
in 1890. and was owned by the African
Steamship Company of London.
INITIATION LEADS TO DEATH.
A Prominent Citizen of low* Succumbs io
Injuries Received in an Elk
Lodge Ceremony.
DES MOINE3, lowa, Nov. 18.â E. W.
Curry, chairman of the Democratic tftate
Central Committee, died to-day in bis
room at the Hotel Savoy. The death was
a direct result of injuries received while
being initiated into Dcs Moines Lod^e of
Elks about two months ago. As part of
the ceremony he was blindfolded and
placed on a chair with an iron seat. Then
a lighted lamp was placed under the seat,
with the expectation that when it got too
hoi he would jump. But he sat still until
he was badly burned. His trousers were
burned away and the flesh fearfully
scorched.
He was put in new clothes, and did not
realize at the time that the injuries were
berious. In a lew days blood-poisoning
set in and he grew worse steadily. It was
his desire that the real cause of his injuries
should not be made public, and another
cause was assigned for the illness, the
truth only becoming public to-day.
An evening paper published a highly
sensational story that the injuries were
caused by placing him, in tne process in
tbe initiation ceremony, in an electrical
chair and turning on a current which
burned him badly, out this is denied by
the Elks.
Mr. Curry lived at Leon and was a lead
ing attorney. The body will be taken
there to-morrow by a large escort of Elks
and Masons, and the funeral will be held
tomorrow afternoon.
PECULIAR CASE OF HYPNOTISM.
A Young Girl Induced to Sign Important
Papers and Then Elopes With
Her Svengali.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 18.â A peculiar
case was . presented to Judge Grosscup in
the United States court to-day in affida
vits and petitions. Six months ago Miss
Emma Cox, one of the heirs of the late
John Cox of Button County, Ohio, riled a
Mitt 'Or acco luting Dr. R. C.
Reed, formerly of Cincinnati and now
living in Los Angeles. The girl's mother,
Mrs. T. A. Cox, alleged in an affidavit
tiled to-day that her daughter had been
unduly influenced .to sign a petition for
dismissal of ' the suit by Charles C.'Bishop
of Elgin, 111., and c his â  mother, a clairvoy
ant of this city, who had exerted hypnotic
rower over the gill, who is quite young.
The wife .of Charles C. Bishop also pre
sented, an affidavit reciting that he left
their home a month ago and had been in
the company of : Emma Cox since then,'
and that she believes the couple are now in
Buffalo, where j they went with money
furnished by Dr. Reed. ;
The petition signed by Miss Cox is
sworn to before Orrlsa Bishop, a notary,
who is father of the man whom the girl is
alleged to have eloped with to Buffalo.
Since coming of age Miss Cox has been
living at the Bishop home, and a few days
ago disappeared. Mrs. Cox resisted the
dismissal of her daughter's suit, and Judge
Grosscup said he would give the girl time
to recover her mind and make an expla
nation if she had signed the release in a
weak mental condition.
FATAL FLORIDA FUNCTION.
In a Row at a Country Dance One Man
Is Mortally Shot and Two Others
Badly Wounded.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 18.â A Herald
special from Ocala, Fla., says: While a
dance was in progress Monday night at
the home of John Baggett, six miles north
of here, Noah Wilson and his son John
had a quarrel with the brother of a girl
whom they insulted.
The Wilsons finally drew their pistols
and opened fire, shooting down Joseph
Howel!, Nelson Howelland George Avery.
Nelson Howell, who was shot three times,
is mortal!} wounded. The other two men
are badly wounded, but have a chance to
recover.
After the Wilsons had emptied their
pistols they drew knives and threatened
to kill any one who molested them. They
then started to leave when John Wilson
was seized by Mamie Avery, sister of one
of the men who was shot. With a vicious
slesh of his knife Wilson gashed the face
of the girl in a horrible manner and she
fell fainting to the floor.
The Wilsons then fled and have not yet
been captured, though the whole country
is aroused and poshes of determined citi
zens are in pursuit. The fugitives are
desperate men and have been in many
rows in this county. They will not sur
render without a desperate fight, for they
know that if taken alive they will proba
bly be lynched.
SLOW REFORM IN TURKEY.
Sone of the Demand* of the Vovserw Car-
ried Into JHxrcution.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 18.â The Daily
News to-morrow will publish a Constan
tinople dispatch saying that Sir Philip W.
Currie, the British Embassador to Turkey,
has been instructed in regard to the re
quest of the Porte that negotiations for
commercial treaties be pushed to take no
action in the matter until the more im
portant matters have been disposed of.
This course, the dispatch adds, is typical
of the general atii'.ade of the foreign pow
ers toward the Turkish Government.
Advices received in Constantinople
from all parts of Asia Minor say that
business everywhere is stagnant and that
great distress prevail*. Nobody in Con
stantinople, according to the news ad
vices, is aware that the reforms adopted
by the powers and agreed to- by the Turk
ish authorities have been carried into
execution.
SENOR CASTILLO'S DEFIANCE
Utters a Threat Against This
Government.
Says Spain Will Brook No Interfer
ence on Behalf of the
Cubans.
PARIS, Fkaxce, Nov. 13.â The Journal
publishes a report of an interview with
Senor Canovas del Castillo, Prime Min
ister of Spain, in which he says the re
lations between Spain and the United
States are excellent. The United States
Government, the Premier says, alrvays
observed a correct attitude, and he does
not believe it will change its policy for
the sake of Cuban negroes and adven
turers.
If, however, the United States Govern
ment should do so Spain would cause her
rights to be respected. While in power,
Senor Castillo is reported as saying, he
will make no concession to the rebels, nor
will he show the weakness of drawinc
back belore anybody. Spain, the Premier
added, regards the Cuban question as one
of international politics.
SPANISH BRUTALITY
Story of Barbarous "treatment Told by
Recnt Prisoners. â 
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 18.â The
thirteen shipwrecked seamen of the
steamer Coila, who were brought to this
port Monday by the steamship Yucatan
from Havana, continued to be very bitter
in their denunciation of Spanish officers
in Cuba, and, in fact, everything Spanish,
when they appeared before tne British
Consul in order to get their discbarge and
tickets to their respective homes.
Jacob Moore, colored, who shipped on
board the Coila as an apprentice, told the
story of the cruel way he had been treated
during his stay in Cuba.
He said that after the Coila had almost
reached Havana and began to sink so rap
idly that it was thought best to abandon
her, which was done at 6 o'clock on the
night of November 4, the entire crew put
out in tbe ship's boats, and alter rowing
several hours reached the River Gani
quanice, Cuba. At a town at tne river's
mouth, they were fairly treated.
The following day they were taken to
Port Mariel under guard of a troop of
Spanish cava.ry and thrown into prison
there. They were all huddled into a small
cell and were compelled to sleep on the
concrete flooring, not being allowed to use
their ditty-bags as headrests, nor were
they allowed to eet the most necessary
toilet articles. Spanish soldiers were on
guard outside of the ceil door day and
nizbt and watched their every movement.
The day following their imprisonment
young Moore was sent for by the official
in command and asked whether he could
speak Spanish. He gave a room full of
officers to understand as best he could
tbat he did not comprehend their lan
guage, whereupon one of them felled him
to the ground b} T a blow on the ear with
the butt oi his revolver. John de Lorrey
here took up up the thread of the story.
"After they had knocked the senses out
of Moore," he said, "and while he was re
gaining consciousness, they sent for me.
The first question they put to me was:
'Are j'ou an Englis: man or an Ameri
can?' I told them I was an Englishman,
whereupon one of them said: 'You lie,
dog of an American,' and struck me over
the head with a cane. I was then given
to understand by motions that I was to
have my throat cut and then s-hot.
"I had almo?t persuaded them that I
was an Englishman, when they discov
ered an American flag which I had tat
tooed on my left hand. This acted on
them like a red flag to a bull, and they
sprang upon me and struck me repeat
ediy in the face.
"They then called in a squad of sol
diers, who were given some orders, upon
receiving which they all pointed their
guns at me. I told them that I was an
Englishman and desired them to fire.
This seemed to cool their ardor, and
Moore, who had by this time come to his
senses, was again brought before them.
"They pointed guns at him and pricked
his flesh with the ends of their swords
until he cried in agony.
"After about two hours of this treat
ment they allowed us to go back to our
cells.
"When I told our Consul in Havana of
the treatment we had been subjected to
he fold us that really it was not anything
out of the common and not worth bother
ing about. He told me, however, not to
say anything about the matter when I
reach- d the States, as those Americans
have so much to say."
Ten of the shipwrecked men will be sent
by the British Consul to their homes in
Canada. Moore will be returned to Ja
maica. David Burns went to his home in
Brooklyn and Joseph Yuhl will remain in
New York.
FILIBUSTERS ON TRIAL.

NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 18. -The trial
of ; Colonel Emiiio Nunez and Captain
Charles B. Dickan upon a charge of having
engaged in a filibustering I expedition in
May last began j in â¢. earnest in the United
States Criminal Court this raornintr. Dis
trict Attorney.Macfariane opened for the
prosecution. He insisted upon' the neces

United States desired to remain, at; peace
with Spain; and emphasizing the fact that

When he had concluded Assistant Dis

President Cleveland's latest proclamation
regarding the Cuban rebellion.
This was objected to by Mr. Rubens and

that the proclamation was issued after the

was committed. A previous Presidential

I was, however, admitted, and tbe examina
tion of witnesses was then begun.
James Quinn, one of the party who
sailed on the Laurada, was the chief wit
ness, and detailed every movement of the
party, which according to his testimony
was a full-fledged military expedition.
j Qtiinn acknowledged that after reaching
Cuba and going to President Cisneros'
camp with the party, he obtained permis
sion to return Home, being allowed to
reach Havana by permission of the Span
ish general. The witness came to New
York, Consul Fitzhugh Lee paying his
passage. On cross-examination by Gen
eral Tracy, witness admitted that he had
solicited a letter from Cubans in Boston
to enable him to sail on the Laurada.
"And so," said General Tracy, "you got
this letter at your own request. You went
to Cuba and you are now here testifying

A NEW RECEIVER
FOR THE SANTA FE
Johnson's Appointment Is
Revoked by a Kan
sas Judge.
Sweeping Actio.n Reopening
Points That Were Consid
ered Settled.
The Company Will Now Attempt to
Get the Matter Before the
Federal Courts.
OSKALOOSA, Kaxs., Nov. 18.â In the
District Court of Jefferson County to-day
Judge Lewis Myers appointed ex-Senator
John Martin as receiver for the Santa Fe
Railroad property in Kansas. The bond,
which was set at |25,000 by the court, will
be filed by Senator Martin at Holton to
morrow or next day, end the p:oqramn:e
is for him todemand immediate possession
of the road. Judge Myers also issued an
injunction restraininz the Santa Fe offi
cials or any other interested parties from
delaying Senator Martin from securing
possession of the property or from hinder
ing him in any manner in the ilischarge
of his duties as receiver. A restraining
order was also issued preventing any suit
being brought apaiust the receiver except
in the District Court of Jefferson County.
The action of Judge Myers is very sweep
ing and opens up the case in many points
hereto;ore considered settled. In fact the
legal status has been, it is admitted, en
tirely changed.
The appointment of Charles F. Johnson
as receiver, heretofore made by Judge
Myers, was revoked. A judicial inquiry
revealed the fact that Johnson had
changed his mind and had refused to
qualify. He had prepared his bond and
had it signed ready for filing when He was
induced to change his course and refuse to
proceed further. His bond was $50,000,
but in Martin's case it was reduced to
$25,000.
Ex-Chief Justice A. P. Horton repre
sented the Santa Fe and was present at
the proceedings. He reiused to appear in
the case, except to call the court's atten
tion to the fact that the Santa Fe nad filed
a petition and bond for the removal of the
case to the Federal Court. The court took
no judicial notice of this, as it does not
recognize the jurisdiction of the Federal
Court in the case, and declared that the
petitions and motions and suits intended
to prevent these proceedings would have to
be heard in the District Court of Jefferson
County.
Judge Horton, on behalf of the Santa
Fe, made application to the clerk of the
court for a transcript of the evidence and
records as they now stand, preparatory to
making another attempt to get the case
in the Federal Courts. While the attor
neys for the receivers do not recognize the
jurisdiction of the Federal Court, they
will, when the case is brought, up for hear
ing there, call Judpe Foster's attention to
the lesal status of the case and points of
law involved tending to show the position
that the Federal Court has no jurisdiction.
Il Judge Foster rules otherwise they will
appeal the case at once in the United
States Federal Court to have the matter
of jurisdiction passed upon.
COUNTER INJUNCTION
Federal Court Restrain* the Seu> Rc
ceirer From Acting.
TOPEKA, Kans.. Nov. 18.â This after
noon attorneys representing ihe Union
Trust Company of New York, which has
become a party to the action in the Santa
Fe case by a cross bill filed io the Federal
court last week, appeared before Judge
Foster in chambers and presented a peti
tion in which a sweeping injunction was
sought against ex-Senator John Martin,
the new receiver of the Santa Fe, ap
pointed by JuCge Myers to-day.
Upon the showing made Judge Foster
granted a restraining order against John
Martin and all persons acting under his
authority, restraining them from in any
manner takins any action in sa:d pre
tended cause in the- District Court of Jeff lÂ»:
-son County, Kansas, looking to the ap
pointment of a receiver or receivers in
said pretended action for the purpose of
in any manner interfering with the
possession of said Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway Company
or any of its property in the
State of Kansas or elsewhere, and
that until the further order of the court
the said Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway Company, its officers, agents,
seivants and employes are hereby com
manded to continue the operation, manage
ment and running of said railway in the
State of Kansas and elsewhere in the same
manner as it has heretofore been managed
and operated.
Late this evening the papers in the case
were served upon Receiver Martin by
United States Marshal Neely. Mr. Martin
Bays he will qualify in the morning and

special from Washington says: Secre
tary Carlisle's last annual report, which

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1896.
JOBBING IN THE
STUFF OF LIFE
Big Elevator Men Responsi
ble for the Depression
in Wheat.
Tabulated Statements Be 'ore a
Chicago Court to Sustain
the Charge.
Startling Developments in the War
Between Warehousemen and the
Board cf Trade.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 18.â In the ele
vator controversy, which was resumed
before Judge Tuley to-day, Attorney
Henry S. Robbins, representing the Board
of Trade interests, advanced a novel and
stnrtling proposition. The evidence v/hich
affirms the basis of his argument was
presented to-day. It consists of tables
compiled from the reports of the Ware
house Commission, and covering the
period from 1873 to 1896. The proposition
which the attorney will urge is that the
hjÂ« elevator men of Chicago are respon
sible for the general depression of the
wheat market.
According to Attorney Robbins, these
tables show that the immense amount of
grain kept constantly in store in Chicago
elevators accounts for the depression of
the market. The statistics show that
while the capacity of the elevators has
increased from 13,000,000 to 41,000,000
bushels since 1873, the total receipts are
practically the same as they were in 1873.
The additional capacity is being utilized,
it is said, for keeping grain in store. Tak
ing first grain of all kinds, the tables show
that with practically the same total re
ceipts for 1874 and 1896 the speculative
tenderfcy Had grown to such an extent
that the least amount of grain in store in
1895 was twice the highest amount in 1874.
The tables next deal with wheat. They
show that the total receipts of wheat
during 1895 were less than in 1874, and the
following deductions are made: The
maximum amount in store for 1895 was
seven and a half times that of 1874, while
the minimum of 1895 was four times the
maiimumv of 1874. The condition of
things in the wheat market was therefore
worse than in the grain market in general.
The object of the elevator-men in keep
ing this grain in store is, Mr. Robbins
argues, to keep prices low so as to reduce
the amount of capital invested.
The controversy between the warehouse
men and the Board of Trade began a year
and a half ago, when the Board of TradÂ«
sought to prevent the warehousemen
from dealing in grain in the open market.
It was claimed that the latter were
violating their charter privileges, as they
were buying and selling grain owned by
other people, which was merely stored in
their warehouses. The Warehouse Com
missioners decided against the elevator
people and the case was then taken into
court.
W. C. T. U. SESSION CLOSES.
Ovation to Emma Booth-Tucker â Evening
Exercises Turned Into a Sponta
neous Praise Jubilee.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 18.â At this morn
ing's session of the W. C. T. U. conven
tion the report of the executive commit
tee was presented, and with hardly an
amendment and little debate was adopted.
Mrs. Emma Booth - Tucker, commis
stoneer-in-chief of the Salvation Army in
America, was introduced to the delegates
and received a Chautauqua salute lasting
several minutes. Mrs. Tucker s;>ote lor
nearly thirty minutes, and her recital of
the work of the Salvation Army moved
many of the delegates to tears.
It was reserved lor the final evening ses
sion of the convention to have the largest
audience and the most enthusiasm.
The vast hall was packed as never be
fore when the chairman announced that
this was people's night and that the offi
cers of the W. C. T. U. would turn the
exercises of the evening over to the private
soldiers. The scenes that followed re
sembled rather a spontaneous jubilee of
praise than the session of a grave, deliber
ate; body. A parade of delegates, every
one of the 550 bearing a flag or an emblem,
marched through the ai-les of the hall.
When this was concluded do.votional ex
ercises were conducted by Mrs. Louise S.
Rounds of Illinois.
Mios Wizard followed, with a short ad
dress. At 9:3o p. m. the audience and dele
gates recited the Lord's Prayer in unison.
Benediction and final adjournment fol
lowed.
The convention just closed is the largest
ever hehi. To the executive committee is
left the duty of selecting the place for the
twenty-fourth annual convention. A
number of cities have urged their claims.
It is believed that the choice lies between
Buffalo, N. V.. and Detroit, Mich., but the
choice may not be made for some time.
TESTING MONSTER GUNS.
Experiments With Disappearing Cannon
That Fire Projectiles Two Thousand
Feet a Second.
WILLETS POINT, N. V., Nov. 18.â A
test of one of the monster 10-inch disap
pearing guns at this fort was made yester
day under the direction of Captain W. A.
Crozier and Lieutenant C. B. Wheeler of
the ordnance department of the army.
The trial met with all the success that
could be desired and it was particularly
gratifying to Capiain Crozier, who is one
of the inventors of the Dufflngton-Crozier
carriage upon which the two guns here
are mounted. The other gun and car
riage had been tested at Sandy Hook be
fore they were brought here.
Until yesterday it had been many years
s;nce any projectile was fired out into the
sound, except on an occasion a year ago",
when through the absentmindedne^s of
the corporal in charge of the signal gun
tue ramrod was forgotten at the firing of
reveille one morning and it was hurled
across the bay in the direction of Fort
Schuyler.
The projectiles which these guns throw
are of steel, with pointed ends, and weigh
575 pounds each. When the projectile was
raised by means of a small derrick attach
ment on the gun and pushed home a
charge of 140 pounds of powder was
brought in bags and put into the breech.
In a short time everything <vas in readi
ness for the first shot.
Lieutenant Wheeler shouted that all was
ready. The spectators muffled their ears
and braced themselves for the shock.
There was a deafening report, followed by
a loud whistling noise, made by the pro
jectile as it ahot through the air over the
beads of the boatmen who were between
the port and the point where the officers
had figured the ball would strike the water.
The smoke soon cleared away and those on
the fort saw the great splash made by the
projectile when it struck. With this small
ctiarge of powder Lieutenant Wheeler said
the velocity of the projectile was 1470 feet
a second. "With ihe first shot, as with all
the others, the working of the carriage
was perfect.
The recoil of the gun caused it to re
cede, and an instant after the shot was
fired the gun was down out of sight be
hind the ramparts, ready to be reloaded.
The gun is thirty feet long and weighs
thirty-tnree tons. After being charged
and aimed it is easily raised by means of
hydraulic power to tne crest of the para
pet. The second shot fired was with 203
pounds of powder. With this the pro
jectile was sent at the rate of 1808 feet a
second. The next three shots were made
with 284 pounds of powder each. The
projectiles carried about six miles at a
velocity of 2014 feet a second.
SWINDLER VALENTINE.
Pleads Guilty to Several Charges, Among
Others the Abduction of Miss
May Wintage.
BROOKLYN, N. V., Nov. 18.â William
F. Valentine, the alleged swindler, who is
believed to be one of a gang of sharpers
that has successfully operated in several
cities, was arraigned this morning to
plead to indictments for forgery and
grand larceny and abduction recently
iound by the Grand Jury.
District Attorney Backus moved his
trial on the charge of forgery in obtaining
money from Henry Batterman on a forged
check, but Valentine pleaded cruilty to the
indictment. Tnen Mr. Backus said he
would prefer to have his plea taken for
the second count in the indictment, which
was forgery in the second degree, and
Valentine's counsel agreed to this. The
District Attorney then moved for the trial
of the prisoner oh the charge of abeuction
and living with May Wntage at 37 Adams
street while she was under age. Valen
tine pleaded Euilty to abduction, which
plea was entered, and be was remanded
for sentence.
District Attorney Backus later con
sented to divulge the mysterious evidence
which he has held back so long in connec
tion with the alleged gang of swindlers.
It is the first official statement made as to
the effect that Valentine met May Wint
age in 1895 for the first time,, when she
was injured by filling from a trolley-car,
and he saved her from being run over.
The acquaintance quicEly ripened, Valen
tine representing himself as a wealthy
builder and giving his name as Edgar.
The couple met several times and went to
Staten Island and Ulster Park for pleasure
trips.
blie finally consented to live with him
as his wife on his assurance that under
the laws of God and man she would be
his wife, as' much as if they had gone
through a ceremony.
Miss Wintaee told her parents that she
had married Valentine in a New York
church. After living with him for some
time she discovered that he had a wife
and family in Hempstead, L. 1., but he
said he was justified in leaving his
wife. An interview between the wife
and Miss Wintage was brought about, and
when the latter discovered that Mrs. Val
entine was a respectable woman she
begged her supposed husband to leave her
and return to his rightful wife.
Before leaving the house she had a faint
ing spell. Tlie girl then wrote her parents,
a-King forgiveness for having deceived
them. She asked permission to return
home and find work. Tiiii letter was
written on paper headed :
Stindard Coal ami Oil Company; stock
$2,000,000, fully paid up, non-assessable. J.
K. Mclaughlin, secretary and treasurer; Ed
ward Tolefree, president. Main office. Wash
ington, D.C.-.'Sew York offke, 293 Liberty
street.
On Valentine's return after an absence
of several days May told him she would
leava him. Then he told her that if she
did so she would be prosecuted for passing
counterleit-checks aiul be would skip the
country. It was the first time she had
heard of any bad checks having been
passed. The gi*i says that when sue still
insisted on going away he grasned her by
the throat and threatened to kill her, and
said that if she dared to tell anything
about him she would be killed. Fright
ened by his violence she remained with
him. He wrote a postal card to her
father saying that May did not mean what
she said in the letter, and assuring him
that everything was ail right.
Shortly after this Valentine and May
V\ intage were arrested for passing bad
checks on Adatas & Co. Valentine cot
out of the scrape by having a friend make
good the amount. May begged the man
to settle all th* :orÂ«ed checks, but he did
not do 60. Miss Wintage then left Valen
tine ami went to live at 120 Ralph avenue,
where she attempted to commit suicide on
October 28 last. While she waa in St.
Mary's Hospital Valentine was arrested

"FAITH AND HUMANITY."
Motto Adopted for Badges by the Council
of Jewish Womenâ Constitutional
Amendments.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 18. âThe
fourth session of the convention of the
National Council of Jewish Women was
called to order at 10 o'clock this morning
by President Hannah G. Solomon. There
was a large attendance of delegates. The
first business transacted was the discus
sion of the report of the committee on
motto and badges. An amendment was
proposed, reading that a badge be adopted,
uml after some discussion it was carried.
The report of the committee on new
legislation was the ivxt business in order.
Before tlie presentation of the report oi
the committee on new legislation, the
motto, '"Faith and Humanity," was
adopted as the most suitable one to be
inscribed on the badges.
The report of the committee on new
legislation was read by Mrs. Pauline il.
Rosenburg of Philadelphia. It is sug
gested that the congress make some
changes in the legislation, chiefly in con
nection with the duties of the officers.
Some of the delegates objected to the word
'â¢National" in the title of the organiza
tion, and the word was dropped and the
name of the organization changed into
"Council of Jewish Women."
It was also voted to amend the consti
tution so as to allow the election of two
vice-presidents. Another amendment
was offered suggesting that a vico-presi
dent for each Stale, Territory and foreign
country be appointed. Mrs. D. Bola of
Montana protested against the words
"foreign country," and a delegate in the
rear of the hall cried out, "Canada will
soon be with us." Tnis was greeted witd
applause.
Finally the words "foreign country"
were omitted and "any otner country
where an organization exists" was sub
stituted.
An amendment was adopted providing
that any person may become a patron of
the council by the annual minimum pay
ment of $10. An amendment was also
adopted providing that one-third of the
membership dues be paid into the treasury
of the National board instead of one-half.

SANTA MONICA
OR SAN PEDRO?
California's Deep - Harbor
Commission Again in
Session.
Gathers Much Valuable Informa
tion to Assist Its
Labors.
About to L^ave for the Golden State
Before Finally Determining
Upon the Site.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 18.â The
Deep Water Harbor Commission, ap
pointed for the purpose of settling the
dispute between Santa Monica and San
Pedro, in Southern California, held au
other meeting to-day, at which considera
ble headway was made toward getting
matters in shape before the departure of
the board for the site of tue proposed im
provement. .
Admiral Walker, chairman of the board,
says while it was hoped the board would
be able to get away by December 2, it
looked as if it could not make a start be
fore a week later. All the actual work save
that of the drawing of a formal report to
the Secretary of War will be done in Cali
fornia.
The commission to-day decided to meet
again in Loa Angeles, Cal., December 9.
During its sitting* in this city the board
has gathered everything that has any
bearing on the subject. This includes
copies of the Congressional Record, con
taining speeches made pro and con in con
nection with this work in the bitter fight
in the Senate, surveys made by officers of
the engineer corps and by officials of the
Coast and Geodetic Survey; estimates
that have been prepared in the past, etc.
All of these will be carried to California.
Tue survey of the Coast and Geodetic Sur
vey is especially elaborate, and will be
found of great value in prosecuting the
work of the board.
The appropriation of $2,900,050 made by
Congress for the construction of this work
will be avaiiaole immediately after the re
port of the board to the Secret-try of War.
The decision of a majority of the whole
board of five members is made absolute
and final by the law.
BREAKING THE ALLIANCE.
Maine's Populist Candidate for Governor
Disgusted at the Outcome of the
Election.
NEW r YORK, N. V., Nov. 18.â A Times
special from Lewistun, Me., says: Every
indication is that the alliance which ex
isted between the Populist and Democratic
parties during the recent National cam
paign can no longer exist.
L. C. Bateman, \fctio was the Populist
candidate for Governor, is constantly in
communication with the leaders of the
middle-of-the-road Populists, and they
declare in the most emphatic terms that
the fusion between the two parties shall
no loneer exist.
Mr. Bateman was asked what would be
the future of the Populist party. He said :
"Bryan and his issua are done for. Had
he boldly planted his foot upon the Popu
list platform he would have been elected
sure. He did not have the nerve to do
this, and he is lost. Daniel Webster made
the same blunder fifty years ago, and with
a similar result. The money question was
started with the mild demand for free
coinage of silver; it will end with the de
monetization of told. This is the mission
of the People's party. W T e shall demand
the ntter overthrow of the whole metal
basis system and the establishment of a
purely scientific paper currency, based
upon the entire wealth of the country.
"We shall demand the Government
ownership of the railroad, telegraph and
telephone lines. Direct legislation will
also be one of our important demamis.
"I look to see, with the passage of a
silver bill by the Republicans, the Silver
Democrats uniting with the gold wing ot
the party and poing back to their old posi
tion of 'opposition party.' Only this and
nothing more.
"The Popuiists are the comine: party.
Watson will be our great leader four years
hence. The present fusion managers have
made a mess of it and are thoroughly dis
credited by the rank and tile, who will
have nothing more to do with them. Some
of them will go into the Democratic party
and the rest will be sent to tiie rear. Their
policy has been tried and found sadly
wanting. These men will never lead our
party into disgrace again."
A CHAT WITH HANNA.
Could Sot B* Secretary of the Treasury
if He So Desired.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 18.â In an
swer to a question put by a United Asso
ciated Presses reporter Mark Hanna said
to-day :
"I was oniy enabled to have a hurried
conference with President-elect McKinley
Tuesday. While a good many questions
were considered, still they were only
touched upon, as we had too many things
to talk about, with a limited time to do it
in."
"Of course you are now slated for Secre
tary of the Treasury? " was remarked.
"Why, I could not be if I wanted to be.
The statutes would not permit it. The
fact is I am debarred by the provision of
the law."
"And you'll get rid of your objectionable
property to accept the $8000 a year job ?"
"Watch me," Mr. Hauna answered with
a smile. 'Do I look as if I had a grudge
against myself?"
"From your returns can you approxi
mately estimate the popular vote for Mc-
Kinley and Bryan?"
"At present 1 could not; in fact, the re
turns are not all in yet. This matter is
now in the hands of the secretary of the
New York headquarters and will be given
out as soon as the totals are made up. The
only estimate I can make now is that Mc-
Kinley wili have over 1,000,000, more votes
after the count is all in than Bryan."
'â¢What Â«re the plans of yourself and
McKinley?"
"McKinley has not decided to go to
Thoroasviile, Go., nor will he come to
Cleveland on Thursday. Tha fact i 3 he
will go no place until Mrs. McKinley's
health is such that she can travel with
safety and comfort. However, I do not
think the Cleveland visit has been given
up, only postponed indefinitely."
"For myself I canuot say what I will
do. I may ro io Thorn asville, Ga., but as
yet have made no definite plans. There
is too much business for me yet awhile to
think of knocking off for a vacation."
WANAMANER'S POSITION
-Vot Out of York. but Wouli Accept a
Sciiatonhitt.
KEW YORK, N. V., Nov. .18.â "I am
not without employment," said John
Wanamaker to-day to a reporter, in an
swer to an inquiry regarding his an
| nounced canUiaacy to succeed beaator
Don Cameron, "but if the Pennsylvanians
want me to represent them in the National
Senate lam willing to do so. lam a mer
chant, not a politician, and I am not seek
ing particularly after public office, but I
have said, through the National League
of Business Men in Philadelphia, in re
sponse to their message, that I consent to
be a candidate for the United States Sena
tor. Tnere will be other candidates, 1
have no doubt. No one has an exclusive
patent right on the title to a senator/ship,
and if several people seek it, all there is
left to do is to submit it to the common
wealth for decision. That I telegraphed
last night to the .Philadelp ia business
men I would do. What others may do I
am not informed. I speak for myself
alone. My candidacy is not based on an
tagonism to any one. If the people want
me to go the Senate, well and good; it
they prefer some one else, why, as I have
said, I shall not be without employment."
THE KANESVILLE COMPACT.
Ohio Will Celebrate Its Fulfillment on
Lincoln's Birthday.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 18.â The an
nual banquet of the Ohio Republican
League, celebrating Lincoln's birthday on
the 12tn of next February, wili have pe
culiar interest this year. The fulfillment
of what ?s known in Ohio politics as the
Z^neaville compact, made at the Republi
can State Convention at Zanesville when
Bushnell was nominated for Governor,
will also be celebrated. The tripartite
compact contemplated making bushnell
Governor, Foraker Senator and 1.-cKinley
President. Each has now been elected to
the office set apart for him in that agree
ment, which united the two factions of
the party and made it more harmonious.
The speakers who have accepted invi
tations to respond to toasts are: John M.
Thurston, J. B. Forafcer, E. O. Wolcott,
James T. McCleary and Booker T. Wash
ington.
HANNAS INELIGIBILITY
May Go Into the Cabinet, but Sot as
Secretary of the Treasury.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 18.â It is a
curious fact that altnough Mr. Hanna has
stated a dozen times, both before and
since the election, that he has no purpose
of becoming a member of Mr. McKinley's
Cabinet the gossips persist in slating him
for Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Hanna
may go into the Cabinet, but he cannot be
Secretary of the Treasury. He is engaged
in both trade and commerce and the stat
utes of the united States prohibit any
person so engaged from being Secretary of
the Treasury. This same objection, it is
said, will apply to Cornelius N. Bliss of
New York, who has also been promi
nently sp ken ot for the head of the Treas
ury Department.
INCREASED SUGAR SUPPLY.
While Cuba's Output Continues to Dimin-
ish the Product of the World is
Growing Materially.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 18 âThis
year's raw-sugar supply of the world sur
passes that of 1895. The official statistics
received at the Department of State from
Consul-General Karel at St. Petersburg
show this. From his report it appears
that the shortage which Russia suffered
this year in the wheat and rice crop will
be more than made up by the increased
beet-sugar prodnction and this increase 13
common to other European countries.
The committee of Russian ministers of
ficially determines for each period of pro
duction the quantity of sugar to be turned
out by ihe sugar factories lor the home
market, which this year was fixed at over
500,000 tons, an excess ever last year of
over 50.000 tons, and the Ministry of
Finance has concluded to lower the prices,
cheapening manufacture.
The improvement is in beet cultivation
and this year's excellent harvest, the new
price being $2 39 per pood of 36,112 pounds,
against $2 44 last year. The official esii
rnate of the world's raw sugar product for
this year is as follows: Production of beet
suirar, 4,956,000 tons; prodnction of cane
sugar. 2,665 000 ions; stock on hand, 1,150,
-000 tons; total, 8,765,000 tons. Last year
the corresponding total was 8,296,620 tons.
The estimated consumption for the en
suing year is placed at 7,340,000 tons.
The export from {Cuba, the principal
producer of cane sugar, is estimated at
400,000 tons, and probably will not reach
that amount.
In the season of 1895-96 Cuba furnished
the world's market with 392,796 tons; in
1894-95 with 754,402 tons, and in 1893-94
with 1,160,172 tons.
These figures, ihe report claims, shows
what an influence the insurrection in
Cuba has on the susar industry, and this
will be felt for some time, for even if the
difficulties shortly cause the Cuban pro
duction could not quickly rise to the
former figures on account of the destruc
tion of property there.
BATTLE WITH A PET DEEK.
Mri. IHrlrille of i'nirvie.w Receives In-
jiirie* Hhich May Prove fatal.
GONZALES. Cal.. Nov. 18.â A few days
since Mrs. H. F. Melville, who lives in
Fairview district, came here on a visit to
her father, J. B. Pugh, accompanied by
her three small children.
While picking apples in the paternal
orchard she was suddenly attacked and
knocked down by a young buck deer kept
as a pet by a neigh bo r.
On regaining her feet the animal made
another onslaught, but the woman seized
him by the horns and a fight for lifts
ensued.
For nearly half an hour Mrs. Melville
retained her grip, being dragged over the
rocky ground and seriously lacerated and
bruised.
One of the children finally ran for Mr.
Pugh. who hastened to the rescue and
with his rifle killed the ferocious buck.
Mrs. Melville has since suffered greatly
from the effects of the combat, and her
physicians think she is injured internally.

DISCUSS SILVER
Efforts to Insert a Free-
Coinage Plank in the
Preamble.
The Most Serious Question the
Assembly Has Yet to
Settle.
Legislation Urged to Protect Nativ-
GlEss-Workers by Keeping Out
Immigrants-
ROCHESTER. N. V., Nov. 18.â The del
egates to the General Assembly of the
Knights of Labor gave up the morning
session to a discussion of the recomenda
tions embodied in the reports of the gen
eral officers and the committee on the state
of the order. No action was taken.
The question of inserting in the pre
amblo a free-silver plank as requested in
the report of General Master Workman
Sovereign is the most serious question
that the Assembly has yet to settle. Since
1889 the Seneral Assemblies have simply
indorsed free silver and it has never been
made a part of the preamble.
The question was discussed at great
length to-day, each delegate taking part
in the debate. No action was taken. The
question of establishing a degree in the
order known as "Minutemen" was also
discussed.
The silver question was again touched
upon by the Knights this evening, but no
decision was reached. The committee on
the slate of the order presented this reso
lution, which will be acted upon to-mor
row:
That the discussion in the General Assem
bly, while monetary reform is fully provided
for in the sixteenth and seventeenth planks of
the preamble, of tbe fr^e coinage of gold and
silrer at a ratio ot 16 to 1, regardless of the
action of any other nation, is important, look
lnsr, as it does, toward the ultimate success of
the system, we desire and we therefore indorse
the agitation and support of freo coinage as a
means to the end we seek.
This called for a long debate.
A request to be allowed to speak to-day
was made by a member of the State
Woman's Suffrage Association, now in
session in this city, nut as it is necessary
for the knights to have notice of twenty
four hours to change a day's programme
it was refused.
The Woman's Suffraee Society then
sent an invitation to the Knights to at
tend on* of their meetings, at which Har
riet A. Keyser will speak on "Triumph of
Industrialism.'' Tbe invitation will be
accepted.
A resolution is now pendine preventing
dual organizations from entering the
Knights of Labor.
No orcanization will be permitted to
hola a charter in the Knights of Labor
that holds a charier in any other trade
union.
in his report, tendered a few days ago,
Secretary-Treasurer Hayes recommended
that the perietal governing board
be instructed as a legislative com
mittee to urge, instead of a
prohibitory tariff on glass, that the tariff
be transferred to tbe immigrant glass
workers, so that the industry may be re
tained by the native workmen and the
foreign workers kept out.
The convention will adjourn to-morrow
nighl.
DEPEW MAY GET A PORTFOLIO.
Growing Belief That the After-Dinner
Orator Will Be Appointed Secre
tary of State.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 18.â A special to
a morning paper from Washington says:
It is said that Major McKinley has Bet
tied already upon the main geographical
positions for his Cabinet.
Under this supposed scheme, it is said,
the Secretary of the Treasury will cer
tainly come from the territory between
the Alleghanies and the Missouri Paver,
and the Secretary of Stats will be chosen
from one of the States east of the moun
tains.
This theory is in harmony with a more
or less well-known desire of the President
elect to keep the Cabinet free from the
suspicion of undue influence on the part
of Wall street.
There is a good deal of quiet talk here
on the supposition that the treasury is
going West, connecting New York with
the position of Secretary of State. For
some reason, which is not entirely ap
parent, the name of Chauncy Depew keeps
cropping up in the most unexpected quar
ter?.
The eossips are pointing out the fact
that he comes from the ereat Empire
State, which has the closest connections
with foreign nations, and in addition his
wealth and social position would
strengthen the administration, especially
among the foreigners visiting here.
The Secretary of State under the pres
ent system has very onerous social duties.

BURGLARS DUNGER WOMEN
I'attardlij Crime lommilted on a Mis
souri Jh'arm.
LIBERIA, Mo., Nov. 18. âA doublo
tragedy was enacted on the Foley farm,
tour miles northeast of here, ia<<t night,
the victims being Mrs. John Foley, a
widow, aged 65 years, and her unmarried
daughter, Jennie, aged 40 years. The
murder wns discovered by William Foley,
aged 25, a son of Mr-. Foley and brother of
Mi*sFolÂ«r. He baa gone to a neighbor's
house between 7 and 8 o'clock in the even
ing and returned home shortly after niid
n'.fjht
When the young man returned home he
noticed that the gates to the farm were
open and the cattle and horses were loose.
He at once suspected something was
wrong. Upon going to the house he dis
covered the door standing wide open.
He rushed into the house, lighted a
match, and was horrified to see his mother
and siater upon the floor dead. Both were
in their nightdresses, which were bespat
tered with biood.
The daughter w*s upon the floor, with
her bead resting against the bed. The
mother was stretched face downward be
side her. The son made a hasty pxami na
tion of the bo ies and ascertait>ed that
they had both been shot, the mother
through she head and the daughter in the
back. He at once aroused the neighbors,
and a posse was organized to search for
the murdevers.
Investigation shows the murder to have
been committed for the sole purpose of
robbery. The murderer first dispatched
the women, then ransacked the house.
Fifty dollars was taken from the bed on
which the women had slept.

Native Sons of California

"Oregonian."
Pass Resolutions Denouncing th
Paper as a Disgrace to
Journalism.
Jealous Ravings cf Its Editor Declared
Sufficient Proof of His
Insanity.
PORTLAND, Or.. Nov. 18.â The 368 na
tive and ex-Californians in Portland held
an indignation meeting to-night, in ac
cordance with a peremptory call issued
to-day, to protest against slanderons
utterances in the Portland Oreaonian last
Thursday regarding California 'men and
women, and entitled "The Tenderloin of
America."
The article in question has aroused
much bitter feeling and to-nigut stinging
speeches were de.ivered by W. T. Hume,
J. D. Mann, J. L. Logan, N. W. Rountree
and other loyal resident Native Sons. A
California woman whose husband was ill
and could not attend the meeting came to
regisier her protest and was cheered again
and again.
A committee on resolutions was ap
pointed, consisting of J. F. Logan, N. W.
Rountree, H. B. Borthwick, Charles Y\
Lamb, Ralph Prager and S. W. Taylor.
The resolutions declare the utterances ns
an insult ana a disgrace to Oregon and the
paper which published them.
Wilson T. Hume acted as chairman and
J. D. Mann secretary. As one result of
to-night's patriotic meeting the Native
Sons of Calitornia in Oregon will form
permanent organization and seek alliance
with the California order. The Cahfor
mens demand a retraction of the editorial
statements.
In to-night's meeting the speakers de
clared that none but an insane man would
have cither written or allowed to be pub
lhheii such statements. The resolutions
conclude as follows:
JUfoivcd, That as native Californians, resi-'
dents in the city of Portland and in conven
tion assembled, we brand the editorial in the
Morning Oregouian es a malicious and villain
ous falsehood and a most uncalled for and very
unkind attack upon the noble men and pure
women who braved tbe hardships of the plains
and the ocean, the attacks of savages, the pri
vations of frontier lite, sacrificed health and
comfort for the purpose of building up the
most glorious State witbin the Union, ana add
mgan empire to the New World, whose women
have received and do receive the respect of
all reputable people vrherever they may meet.
And we protest that the editorial referred to is
& disgrace to the paper that published it, and
unless retracted will brand the paper as a dis
grace to this community and to the State of
Oregon.
CAPTAIN DREYFUS' CASE.
The French Minister of War Takes the
Floor in Reply to a Deputy's
Interpellation.
PARIS, France, Nov. 18.â In the
Chamber of Deputies to-day President
Brisson gave the floor to General Biilot,
Minister of War, when the proposed inter
pellation of M. Castelan (Republican Re
visionist) in regard to the conviction of
Captain Dreyfus, the French military
officer, who was degraded and sentenced
to life imprisonment for betraying mili
tary secrets to Germany, was called in its
order.
General Billot read a short statement
declaring that the question was an ex
tremely grave one, tbe interests of justice
and the country being at stake. The
court-martial which had tried and sen
tenced Captain Dreyfus had been regu
larly constituted and after an exhaustive
examination of the case had been unan.
mous in pronouncing judgment against
him. Later the council of revision had
given complete consider ation to the case
and had unanimously rejected Dreyfus>'
appeal from the judgment of the court
martial, and nobody. General Billot Â«aid,
had a right to reopen the case. Every
precaution had been taken to prevent the
escape of Dreyfus from the Isle dv Abile,
on the coast of French Guiana, where he
is confined. He concluded by appealing
to the patriotism of the Chamber not to
debate the question. [Applause.]
M. Castelan persisted in tiie discussion
of his motion, amid murmurs of dissent,
and demanded the prosecution of the au
thors of the campaign in favor of Drey
fus' release, who, he said, had spread
broadcast the most iniamous stories of
Dreyfus having been the victim of a plot.
Finally the Chamber alruosi unar.inuus
ly voted confidence in the Government
and It* conviction that the Government
would search for the persons responsible
for any reveiations in regard to the con
demnation of Dreyfus if there should be
any occasion to do so.
The Government only accepted the order
of the day in consideration of the adop
tion of the last words of the resolution.
They had previously insisted u;>on the
order of the day, pure and simple, which
tbe Chambers were disposed to vote.

BIG CATCH OF FEATHERS.
The Seven Mct'utcheon Brothers Slake
a Stake of Over 87000 on
Kgret Plnniage.
G. W. McCutcheon, one of the seven â 
brothers who have been busy hunting for
the feathers of rare birds which inhabit
Madelaine Bay, Lower California, is in
the City. Mr. McCutcheon and his broth
ers have beecn hunting there during the
entire senson.
They have taken a big quantity of the
feathers of the egret, heron, eider duck
and other birds. Tne feathers ere of rare
value, and are used to decorate the finest
millinery. Many of them will be sent to
France. London. Berlin and other fashion
able centers of Europe, and then, as likely
as not, will come back to this City and
cost enormous figures. This has frequently
been the ca*e in the past.
The eeret feathers are worth $32 a pound
in San Francisco, and none of the other
feathers are worth less than $5 or $6 a
pound. Madelaine Bay is a celebrated
place for hunting these birds. The main
land of Mexico for the last two or threo
years has been prolific of these birds, but
so many hunters went in that Sinaloa,
Sonora and similar States that formerly
afforded cood htintine-erounds are now
lanrely depleted of the Birds.
Madelaine Bay. however, is a compara
tively new discovery of the hunters. This
place the birds frequent on their annual
pilgrimages from th ir native grounds in
the north.
As a result stilled hunters, among them
tbe McCutcheon brother?, nave gone there
and have bÂ»en well repaid. This bay is
larger than the bay of San Francisco, and
all admit it iÂ« a wilderness. Only in one
place, so it is stated, is there any settle
ment, and that consists of bat three or
four house".
The McCutcheon brothers are credited
with getting feathers this year of the value
of over $7000. Mr. McCutcheon has been
visitine San Diego, and will now go to
Stockton lor n short time. His brothers
are expected here in a few days.
The brothers are experienced and very
skillful hunters. Probably there are none
better on the Pacific Coast, and it is a
question if any one besides Hamlin Smith,
the White Chief of the Cocopahs, also a
feather-hunter, is their equal. The Mc-
Cutciieon brothers are not inclined to go
into details as to their mode of taking the
feather*. They use guns along shore and
out in the bay and employ native hunters
as it may seem advantageous.

THE UNMARRIED MAN.
Twelve Reasons Why a Man Should
Beuia'n a *>achÂ«lor.
1. If a man is naturally selfish for good
ne-s sake Jet him always look after No. 1,
is the advice given in London Tit-Bits.
2. If his mother is the best cook in the
world let him stop with ber.
3. If whenever be opens his mouth he is
always puttinc his foot in it he had better
never propose to a girl.
4. If he is a thorough miser, it were
better for him to remain singular-ly miser
able.
5. If he is generally a woman-hater, let
him become a hermit in tiie Isle of Man.
6. If he detests children and calls them
pests, he is evidently uncivilized and un
worthy to frequent the haunts of a civil
ized community.
7. If physically and constitutional^' un
fitted for matrimony, it is nothing less
than criminal for him to marry.
8. If a man is blessed with a good sister
to whom be is unkind, and even cruel he
is certainly unsuitable for a partner to
any one else's sister.
9. If a man is earning les* salary than
the woman whom he might care to marry
is earning let him not marry her.
10. If a man would be likely to prefer
after marriage the company of club asso
ciates and tte pleasures ot the billiard ta
ble to the sweet corÂ»panionship or hallowed
happiness of a i.orne let him retrain from
thinking of marrying.
11. If a man will De unable to maintain
a wife as comiortably as she has been used
to, and unless he has something saved to
ward future unforeseen eventualities, be
had better remain a bachelor, for when
poverty comes in at the door love flies out
of the window.
12. If He would be unwilling to frankly
and candidly tell before marriage every
thing of his past li!e which in the event
of Uis marrying would if lound out cause
endless trouble and lifelong unhappiness
let him Dy all means remain single.

LASHED TO TREES
ON THE MOUNTAIN
Prospectors in the Cascades
Pass a Night of
Horror.
Tie Themselves to Keep From
Being ( W2pt Down by
Avalanches.
Lives of Many Mountaineers Be*
lieved to Have B en Lost
Daring the Storm.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 18.â Residents
of Seattle ana v.ciuity who by reason of
floods and snow have been prisoners since
Friday last in a fastness of the Cascade
Mountains are arriving, some on gravel
trains, some afoot and others by boat.
They tell a harrowing tale of Buffering,
devastation and destruction. The situa
tion as described in these dispa'ches from
day to day has not been exaggerated in
the least, if indeed the fury and fierceness
of the storm has been fuKy portrayed.
There l>as been great suffering, and no
doubt many miners and prospectors in
the Cascades have met death from snow
slides and drowning.
Four prospectors, headed by Joseph
Nicholson, operating a claim in Snoqual
mie Pass in the Cascades for C. P. Devine,
a merchant of this city, arrived this after
noon. One of the men is a raving maniac
because of the suffering and hardships
endured in their effort to get out. On
Saturday night in order to keep from be
ing swept down the mountain by snow
sliaes the four prospectors lashed them
selves to trees. Here they remained in
the drenching rain for six or eight hours.
Meanwhile great bowlders, earth and huge
sections of snow kept sliding down into
the canyons and gulches below. Trees
were torn up by the roots and carried
away by avalanches. The noise was some
thing indescribably horrifying.
On Sunday with the break of day the
prospectors tore away the lashings and
j began their perilous journey out of the
mountains. They followed Gold Creek to
j Lake Keechelos, tramping through snow
four and five feet deep, crossing small
streams on logs and driftwood, finally
| finding their way to where the Northern
Pacific crosses the Cascades, and thence
down the railroad to this city.
Two Seattle business men were caught
at Index on Thursday. They were three
days walking thirty-live miles to Sno
homis 1 :, crossing small streams on drift
wood and larger ones by boat. They re
port that No. 3 Great Northern westbound
overland passen.er train, with forty-one
passengers, due here last Friday morning
at 7 o'clock, is stranded between Wel
lington and Madison, it being impossible,
owing to the great washouts on either
side, to get the train out. This fact the
railroad officials have carefully concealed
from the public. When last beard from
twelve rirst-class passengers were supplied
| with half rations from the dining-car,
| while the day-coach and second-class
passengers, including twenty-f^ur Chi
nese, managed to procure scant food sup
plies from Wellington. The Chinese are
bound for China by the steamship Kiushiu
Maru, now in port.
The gentlemen giving this information
say there are ten washouts on the Great
Northern lrom Index to Sultan, a dis
! tance of fourteen miles. On the upper
! falls of the Skykomis two bridges are
â¢ gone, besides 1200-foot washouts and a
i number of slide-*. When the flood was at
its height the Great Northern main line
between Monrow and Skykomish, a dis
tance of seven miles, was inundated to a
depth from six to fifteen feet.
To-day's advices are to the effect that
the waters of all rivers have raceded to
within their, banks, save at Snobomish.
In the flats and bottoms the water cov
ered thousands of acres of rich farm land,
leaving nothing but wreck and ruin. The
Great Northern is making no attempt to
run trains, save a passenger on the coast
line north to Stanwood. Large forces of
men are at work on the coast and main
line, but there is but little prospect of
early resumption of traffic.
Three minutes after the Northern Pa-
cific Portland passenger train coming
toward Tacoiua had passed along Sunday
night, a half mile of the track and road
bed near Ainsle slid into the Cowiitz
River. A. E. JLanier, a commercial trav
eler, who was on the train, says the noise
could be heard for miles around.
The Saturday and Sunday Eastern
mails were received in this city to-day,
but there has been none from San Frau
cisco and south since last Friday night.
The Northern Pacific, by transftrrinp, is
now running overland trains from Ta
ccma, making steamer connections from
this city also to" Portland.
A report from Everett says that 200 cat
tle were drowned there, and steamers are
plying over the marshes to save human
lives.
GREAT DAMAGE AT WALLACE.
Plactr Crrek Cutm Out a Course Through
t'l* loir n.
SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 18.â After be
ing shut off nearly a week from outside
communication by transcontinental rail
roads, the blockade was raised, a wreck
ing train having been sent west on the
Northern Pacific.
A bridge is out at Yakiraa, but repairs
enough have been made to enable a trans
fer ot passengers at tDat point. As yet
the road east of here has not been re
paired, but word from Missoula to-night
is that a foice of several i undred men is
at work on the bridges washed out and
that trains will be moving soon. Several
trains are held at Missoula. The Cover
d'Alene mines are cut off almost entirely.
Wallace is ball submerged, the damage
in that city being great. Placer Creek
ov<rwashed its banks and the turbulent
stream passed througn the town, carrying
everything id its patn. Fortunately no
lives were lose, but the main street is now
submerced and it will be with difficulty
that the creek will be returned to us old
bed, ir. Having cut a path directly through
the town, under houses and across
streets.
The latest reports from the Cascades in
dicate that the Great Northern cannot
move train* for a week yet. Its lines
east of here is in nearly as bad condition,

Ball, a prominent member of the medical
profession of this city, disappeared about
ten days ago under peculiar circum

but by whom he does not know, ana that
all his money was taken from him.

CARSON, Nev., Nov. 18.â A very lively
fistic encounter took place in front of the
Government building this afternoon be
tween Sam Davis, editor of the Appeal,
and Charles Jones, United States District
Attorney. It was stopped by an officer
before any serious damage was done to
either participant. The Appeal has re

A HORRID SUPERSTITION.
An Instance in Bengal Which Shows
the Absurdity of .Native Beliefs.
We all know a horrid custom of the
past, which was that of human sacrifices
in conjunction with the erection of a
building or the construction of a bridge.
It was supposed that no such superstition
was discovered among the Dravido-
Tibetan races. A correspondent writes to
Nature that this belief does exist.
There was a ridiculous story rife in Ben
gal not long ago that the Queen of Eng
land, for some purpose unknown, wanted
the heads ot five children from each vil
lage. All the villagers hid and were pre
pared to ficht for their children.
It took months before the people could
be made to believe how utterly absurd was
the story. After auriiiie it was found out
that the report of children having been
wanted arose from tbe fact that a founda
tion was to be built for a great railroad
bridge. It was discovered that among the
people living in the past it had been the
custom to sacrifice a victim when any
thing of importance in the way of build
ing was undertaken. Then the stories of
former ages, when these acts were carried
on, had not passed away, and they remain
in folklore. At ieast the dread of the Ben
gal coolies was based on tradition.

number of workmen took possession of

floor, and with a pile of rugs and draperies
proceeded to make tests. The first thing
done was to cover the floor with heavy

was to solve the difficulty by iryinz the

gradually take away the materials little

as necessary. He thought that tbe dra

all that was needed. i>ugs would not be
used, he said, unless absolutely necessary,
as the marble floors were not nearly as
noisy as was expected and were more
cleanly. â Rochester Union.

MOORE PLEADS
IN HIS DEFENSE
Declares His Confession of
the Greenwood Murder
Was False.
Said He Was on the Verge of
Delirium Tremens When
It Was Mads.
Tired of Life and Dreading Suicide,
He Sought Death at the Hands
of Lynchers.
NAPA, Cal., Nov. 18.â William Roe.
alias William Moore, the confessed mur
derer of Mrs. Greenwood, occupied tne
witness-stand in the Superior Court this
afternoon. He reiterated his former
declaration that he had falsely confessed
that he was a murderer, because he be
lieved that by so doing he would soon be
come the victim of a lynching party. This
he desired, as he was wear}' of life, but re
ligious teachings prevented him from com
mitting suiÂ«idc. Moore's testimony was
substantially as follows:
My name is William M. Roe. I am well ac
quainted vriih Mr. Snliaug, who has testified
during this trial. About one month previous
to the making bf the alleged confession to
Mr. Schaug I had Dee.i drinking to excessâ
drinking whisky, wine, absinthe and brandy.
At night I cou d not sleep, for I was on the
verge of delirium tremens. 1 was despairing,
tired of life, and wanttd to get out of the
world. 1 told this to Mr. Schaug, and he said
that if I were determined to do this 1 might
help him in some way, and that he would go
In <rith me. Somebody would then be bene
fited. I then made a statement to Sehaug, but
the one in evidence is not the way I gnve it to
Schaug. I gave him daces, names of places
and names of persons wnoni I had met. Mr.
Schaug put in the filling.
1 never admitted the killing of Mrs. Green
wood. The supposed confession is a fabrica
tion and a lie as far as murders and robberies
are concerned. When I talked with Mrs.
Weyse about the Greenwood murder I was in a
similar condition as when speaking to Schaug.
At night I could not sleep because of the
imaginary animals I would see. During the
day 1 would drink liquors. When talking with
Mrs. Weyse I don't remember of saying I
killed Mrs. Greenwood. If I did make any
such statement it is untrue. While coming
up on the train and talking with Sheriff Burr
and Sheriff JlcKenzle my miud was far from
being clear. What I stated to Sheriff McKen
zle was done with the hopes that 1 might be
lynched.
The last part of January, 1891, 1 left Napa
County for San Francisco, and was in that
City and not in Napa County at the time of
the murder. I remained in San Francisco un
til after February 14, I^9l. In reference to
my watch, of which there has been much dis
cussion, I sold the watch to a person in San
Francisco iv the latter part of January, 1891.
When Moore had coneiuded the hour
â was late and the case went over until to
morrow.
When court convened this morning C.
J. Beerstecber offered in evidence the
statement alleged to have been made by
Moore to Schaug in San Bernardino,
wherein he confessed to a score of mur
ders. J. T. York then made thiÂ» following
open statement for the defense:
May it please the court and gentlemen of
the jury: At this time it becomes the duty of
ihe defense to state to you ir: general terms an
outline of what we intend to prove on behalf
of the prisoner. In the first place, without in
dulging in ant remarks other than a sketch or
outline of our evidence, we intend to produce
before you witnesses who have known this de
fendant while he resided in other parts of the
btateâ in Woodiand and around In that coun
tryâthat section of the State whore he worked
for several years, a period of some live years I
should think. We will prove that during ihe
course of his life all that time he bore a good
reputation for peace and quietude and hon
esty, and that he was iudustnoue; that during
lhai portion of his life no blemish could be
found upon his reputation, and that every
one who know him in that section of the
country knew him as a good, faithful, ordin
arily re^pectftD'.e citizen.
Next we will introduce before you a witness
wno resided in and about Napa who knew him
wen while he worked here. He was during
his life a farintmrHi, spending most of his time
on farms, sometimes engaged in breaking
horses, and while he resided herein Napa or'
in and about Xapa he was industrious and
bore a eoodrenutaiion for peace and quietude.
We next follow him to his southern home,
where, for many year.-â 3orue four or live years
âhe worked on farms and was a, trusted em
ploye. During that time he bore a good rcpu
tatioa for peace and quietude. The prisoner
will take the stand aud he will tell you con
cerning these alleged statements made to Mr.
ShauÂ», and those made to Mr?. Weyse, and
those made to Sheriff Burr, and those "made to
Mr. MtKenzic, the siicriff of this county. In
this statement he will tell you his reasons lor
making thereâ the reasons that actuated him
in the whole affairâ and you must be ihe judge
of the truth or faisity of his statement, as you
are of all the witnesses who may be produced
in this statement.
iHe will tell you that for some time prior to
hi.< stnlvmenis to Mrs. Weyse and to the Sher
iff, who came up here to testify, his health
had been bail ; tiiat for some tinie beiore ho.
by reason of ill heulth, commenced a course of
drinking; that he wÂ»* i toxicaied for a long j
period of time prior to that and at the time
the alleged statements were made by him he
was verging upon delirium tremens, and his
sole idea at that time was to get rid of Hie, as
it hai been a failure so far as. he waa con
cerned. Brought up by Christian parents, his
idea was that it was a sin ami a wrong to take
his own life, and he came here with the sole
idea thnt he would rather permit some other
instrumentality to take his life, arfd that be
came his sole idea and fixed determination.
He will also testify as to his whereabouts.
During the lapse of time of live years from
the time the Greenwood murder occurred wit
nesses have left the Slate and goi;e we know
not where. We have bt-en unable to find wit
nesses of great importance to the prisoner. I
because o( deaths or removals irom one dlbco
to another, lor the reason that the prisoner at
the bar wm a laboring man and associated
with men who work upon ranches and who
moved where they might find work or em
ploymentâtransient men they might call
them, although Industrious, reputable citi
zens.
When, after introducing our testimony, we
believe that you will be able to ascertain the
facts more accurately than you will be at pres
ent, and after having heard and determined
these facts you will bring in a verdict in ac
cordance with the law and in aocordace with
the evidence. We intend to introduce for your
consideration the wnole of an alleged written
statement made by this defendant to Mie wit
ness Schaug, and we intend to show by that
statement the improbability and impossibility
of the truth of the narrative. From that, gen
tlemen, from that writing itself, we expect to
hhow to you that the whole was a fabrication
of a disordered mind.
George Gould of Woodland testified that
for five seasonsâ from 1883 to 1888â Moore
worked for him on a thresher and during
that time bore a good reputation. Peter
Lynch, for whom Moore had worked in
Napa County, testified that as far as he
knew Moore's reputation was good. F. A.
McGail, a contractor for street grading in
Los Angeles, stated that Moore worked
for him sixteen months in 1892 and 1893,
and that during that time he was honest
and industrious, and had the respect of
the men working with him. Mrs. Louise
Naud of Los Angeles, a sister of Mrs.
Weyse, testified that she had heard
Moore's character discussed by many peo
ple, and that Moore was considered hon
est, faithful and industrious. M-s. Weyse
testified along the same line.

FEMALE KNIGHTS OF THE GRIP.
Women Commercial Travelers Who Are
Forcing the Male Drummer From
the Field.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 18.â Never be
fore in the history of this city were there
so many female commercial travelers here
as at present. Unlike their male col
leagues, they do not emblazon their names
upon the registers of prominent hotels,
but they seek the seclusion of boarding
houses, where they can find comparative
comfort of a home after their day's busi
ness is finished. One of these women,
representing one of the largest millinery
houses in Chicago, remarked last evening
that since the election of McKinley 500
Chicago women have been sent on the
road to solicit trade. They represent al
most every branch of trade, excepting
tobacco and liquors, hardware and other
heavy lines.
"Out of these 500 women I'll venture to
say," remarked she, "300 have taken the
places of men who were laid off six months
or more before me election. The women
thus substituting the men are well up in
the lines of trade they represent. Mos;
of them have had successful experience as
saleswomen for years in the houaes now
sending them on the road, and they can
talk business as intelligently and as per
suasively as their male predecessors.
While their salary is as lame as that of
male drummers yet their houses make a
great saving in their expense bills. You
know we don't have cigar and wine bills
to swell our expense accounts."
In addition, this woman remarked that
Chicago's innovation is bearing good fruit
for her sex in Boston, New York and St.
Louis, and that the advance army of 500
female drummers from Chicago means the
opening of a new, large und profitable
held for several thousand respectable,
business-like women, whose class has from
time immemorial almost been waiting for
a like opportunity.
CIVIL SERVICE, CHANGES.
Eitles Affecting Sary-Yavd Employ e%
M>on to Be Published.
VALLEJO, Cal., Nov. 18.â Ever since
the result of the recent election all em
ployes at the navy-yard who were supposed
to be under civil service rules have been
anxious to know whether orders had been
received placing them on such a basis.
David Clopton, at tiio navy-yard at Mare
Island, a warm personal friend of the
Secretary of the Navy, sent a query to the
Navy Department a few days ago as to
whether any otiicial notification would be
sent to the Mare Island Navy-yard thnt
the civil service rules had been extended
to cover employes at navy-yards.
In response Mr. Clopton has just
received the following: "The rules which
were published on May 6, 189(3, have been
undergoing revision and as yet the com
mission has not a supply of the revised
rules on hand. However, they expect
them in the course of a lew days when
copies will be sent in due course to com
mandants and heads of departments at
navy-yards."

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1896.
NORMAL SCHOOL
FACULTY SUED
Miss Lulu Mess Demands
Damages Because
Expelled.
Claims the San Jose Instructors
Injured Her Character
' Without Cause.
Was Dropped From the Rolls for
Alleged Untruthfulness and
Immorality.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 18.â Lulu E. Mess
to-day began suit in the Superior Court
against Professor E. 11. Randall and
twenty-six other teachers, comprising the
faculty of the State Normal School of this
city, for $10,000 damages for expulsion as
a pupil from that institution.
In tbe complaint it is alleced that Miss
Mess entered the Normal Sctiool on
February 6, 1594, to fit herself as a teacher,
so as to provide for herself and widowed
mother; but on November 9, IS9G, she was
dismissed by the faculty. She alleges that
the defendants, without cause or reason
and without any right or excuse whatever,
accused her of beir.g an untruthful and
immoral woman a..d devoid of the in
stincts and lady-like qualities necessary
to become a successful teacher. Plaintiff
alleges that by reason of the dismissal and
the refusal of defendants to permit her to
complete her course of study at the
Normal School she has been damaged in
the snm of $10,000, and she asks judgment
for this snm against the defendants, and
for costs of suit.
Miss Lulu E. Mess is about 20 years of
age, and came to San Jose from St.
Helena, Napa County, where she resides
with her widowed mother, to enter the
Normal School. She claims that a num
ber of the teachers took a great dislike to
her, and for the past year have persecuted
QÂ«r in every imaginable way. They ac
cused her of stealing books and several
other articles from the building, and also
with leading an immoral life. Those who
know Miss Mess speak very highly of her.

the face and head of the victim and his
head W3S nearly severed from his body.
Several slashes with a sharp instrument,
probably a knife, had severed both the
jugular vein and carotid artery.
The appearance of the ground around
the railway track above where the- body
â¢was found showed that the murderer and
his victim had engaged in a terrible strug
gle. There was a trail of blood leading in
the direction of Los Gatos, and it is sup
posed that the murderer was wounded in
the struggle. The body was dragged to
the foot of the embankment after the
deed was committed. There is no clew to
the murderer, but the supposition is that
the man was killed by a tramp.
The body was identified this afternoon
as that of Kaku Heiashi, who had been
employed on the Pine ranch, above Los
Gatos, for the past three months. He left
the ranch at 3 o'clock this morning with
$.XJ in his pocket. No money was found
on the body, showing plainly that the
murderer's object was robbery.
The Bryan Fifty Robbed.
SAN JOSE. Cal., Nov. 18 âAbe Jones,
captain of the Bryan Fifty, to-day swore
to a complaint before Justice Dwyer
charging; Ignacio Pulanco with embezzling
$19 50 belonging to the organization. It
is alleged that Pulanco, who is a member
of the company, on October 10 collected
the money from different people for the
purpose of buying uniforms for the mem
bers, but appropriated the money to his
own use. â  _^^
PORTLAND DOCTORS PUZZLED.
Sudden Death of a Man Whose Hiart
Had Grown to the Size of a
Bullock's.
PORTLAND, Or.. Nov. 18 âThere died
on Sunday night in this city John Ran
dolph, who, with his heart enlarged to the
size of a bullock's, had lor years been do
me the arduous labor of a longshoreman
on the river front. In the Coroner's in
vestigation into his death to-day a cas9
was developed that amazes the medical
fraternity.
Randolph had not complained of any
serious pain beyond shortness of breath
at times, and when on Sunday night when
seating himself at table he fell suddenly
forward and expired the family feared
that there had been foul play. Randolph's
heart had i-o enlarge > tiiat, pressing into
the cavities of the cliest, it had so reduced
the cellular space of the. lungs that only
about a fifth of the air cells could bo
brought into play. The enlargement
downward had interfered witn the stom
ach in such a manner that it is impossible
to conceive how any but liquid food Mould
be taken.
Itisamuzine to surgeons that he could
have taken sufficient oxygen into hiscom
f>ressed lungs to enable him to waik, much
ess trundle a cargo truck, for the air he
inhaled at each breath was !eÂ«s than that
required by a healthy Mx-year-old lad.
Tne Coroner's jury returned a verdict of
death from natural causes.

DISABLED AT SEA.
Steamer Alice Blanchard Returning to
San Francisco in Tow of the
Farallon.
EUREKA, Cal., Nev. 18.â The steamer
North Fork, which arrived at this port at
10 o'clock to-nignt, reports having met the
steamer Farallon seven miles north of
Cape Mendocino, having in tow the
nteamer Alice Blanchard in a disabled
condition.
The Farallon was bound for Eureka
from Portland, but on account of her tow
did not put in. She transferred to the
North Fork four passengers for Eureka.
The Blanchard left Empire City at 9
A. M. Tuesday and the Farallon at 11 A. m.
At 2 p. m. the Farailon hove to in sight of
the Blanchard and about an hour later
beard the Blanchard whistling for assist
ance.
Putting on all speed the Farallon soon
reached the Blancnard, the captain of
which reported that his vessed had run
into a log and stove a hole in her port
bow. A heavy sea was on, and with much
difficulty a patch had been put on, not
withstanding which the Blanchard had
four feet of water in her hold. The Faral
lon immediately took the Blanchard in
tow, and made for Poet Orford, which was
reached at 6 p. m.
At this place, with the assistance of
pumps from the Farallon, the Blanchard
was pumped out and temporary repairs
made, which were completed at 11 o'clock.
Then the Farallon took the disabled
steamer into tow and sailed for San Fran
cisco.
Captain Roberts of the Farallon sent
word to this city that he would reach San
Francisco about midnight to-morrow.
LOS ANGELES REFORMERS.
Chief of Police Glass' Removal De-
manded by the Ministerial
Union.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. IS.â The
Ministerial Union, after an exciting de
bate this afternoon, passed a resolution
demanding the removal of Chief of Police
Glass as a necessary step in the direction
of municipal reform. Chief Glass but
recently received the hearty indorsement
of the Better City Government Leaeue for
the manner in waich he has managed
tne police department during the past
six years. This attack by the ministers
has therefore created considerable sur
prise.
The opposition to the Chief is beaded
by Rev. J. A. B. Wilson, the pastor of the
First Methodist Church, who insists that
disorderly houses, poolrooms and kindred
dens of vice should be suppressed in
stanter by the strong arm ol the law.
Mr. Wilson has declared that Los Angeles
is a far more wicked city than Chicago. This
remark has aroused the indignation of
many citizens and Chief Glass refused to
receive a committee of which Rev. Mr.
VV ilnon was a member. The Chief has some
defenders among the clerpy and it is not
probable that his place will be declared
vacant in accordance with the demands of
the reformers.

GENERAL ELI
MURRAY DEAD
Utah's Ex- Governor Passes
Away at His Old Home
in Kentucky.
Had Gone East in Search of
Health, but Rapidly
Declined.
A Man Who Was Prominent in
Political Circles of Three
States.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 18.â A tele
gram received here to-night stated that
General Eli Houston Murray died this
afternoon at 3:30 o'clock at Bowling
Green, Ky. He left this city a month ago
with his family in the hope that a return
to his o^d home in Kentucky would bene
fit bis health. He had been rapidly fail
ing in health for six months prior to his
departure.
General Murray was born in Breckin
ridge County, Ky., on September 12,
1844, and was therefore 52 years old. He
entered the United Statas army when 17 j
years old as a volunteer and commanded
a brigade in Kentucky in 1%2 and 1863,
being the youngest brigadier-general in
the army. In 18G5 he received the brevet
of brigadier-general of volunteers for ser
vices during the war. He was appointed
United States Marshal for KentucKy in
1866 and held office until 1876, when he
became manager of tne Louisville Com
mercial. He was appointed Governor of
Utah in 1880 and reappointed by President
Arthur in 1884 for a term of four years,
but resigned before the expiration of his
term. His administration as Governor
was marked by energetic opposition to
Mormonism and the spread of polygamy.
General Murray came direct from Salt
Lake to San Diego in 1887 and became in
terested in land matters in Lower Califor
nia, being the principal owner of the
Valley of the Palms, fifty miles south of
San Diego. He was also interested in irri
gation enterprises, but in these as well as
in land investments fortune deserted him.
In 1890 he was editor of the San Diego
Union and later a candidate for nomina
tion for Congressman in the old Sixth
District of California, but was defeated.
He had lived here quietly until he left for
Kentucky last month.
General Murray, before his last illness,
was a magnificent specimen of physical
manhood and very popular. He was a
cousin of ex-Governor Crittenden of Mis
souri, Consul-General to Mexico at the
present time. General Murray leaves a
widow, one son aud one daughter, both
nearly grown.
SAN DIEGO-ORIENT STEAMERS.
Xew Project Backed b>/ Chicago and Mew
York Capitalists.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 18.â A. H.
Butler arrived this evening from Chicago.
He comes in the interest of the Araericah
line of steamships across tbe Pacific from
San Diego.
It is proposed by certain capitalists of
Chicago and New York â among' them
Benjamin P. Cheney, A. C. Walker, E. C.
Potter, President Gibbs oi the New York
Life, and others â to put on a line of 8000
-ton steamers, with a speed of twenty knots
und as elegantly furnished and equipped
as the Atlantic liners, to run between
Yokohama and San Diego, in connection
with the Santa Fe Company. Mr. Butler
was asked what he had to say regarding
the new line.
"It is not time to say anything about
this yet," he said, "and I regret that the
papers have mentioned it. If the busi
ness Is carefully managed the plan is per
fectly feasible and has every element of
success, but it will not do to discuss it
publicly."
"What is the purpose of your visit herer
Do you intend to meet anybody?"
"No," said Mr. Butler, "not at this
time. Mr. Potter, who is at work with
me on the matter, will leave Chicago on
the 27th on his way here. I am going
north on private business and will gei
back and meet Mr. Potter. We intend to
meet the leading men of Saa Diego and
Los Angeles and come to an understand
ing on the steamship line. At that tima
the proposition may be made public, but
not before."

f " It Is the Duty of the Government/* Says J. F Halloran,
" to See That the Great Sources of National
Wealth Are Not Wasted/
J. F. Halloran, general manager of the Mining and Scientific Press of this City,
the original advocate of the idea, when seen yesterday afternoon said:
"For several years the Mining and Scientific Press has favored the creation of a
new department in the Cabinet, a Secretary of Mines and Mining, and the increased
interest in the mining industry throughout this west half of tiie Nation in the past
three years has aroused renewed realization of miners' requirements. The hard deal
that the miners bad been getting at the hands of arrogant and ignorant department
heads is of itself sutVicient reason for the establishment of a bureau of mines, the crea
tion of a Cabinet otticer whose sole business^it shall be to attend to that great industry.
"With no more than passing reference to the dignity of the mining profession or
to the fact that upon the prosperity of the mineral industry primarily rests the pros
perity of any country, it is bnt necessary to cite the present value and extent of the j
mining industries of this Nation and the evident in/Tease. The total value of the
mineral and metal production of the United States for the year 1594 was $581,211,2")3;
for 1593 it aggregated $673,001,934; for this year I believe it will be $7 2"), 000, 000. An
industry that represents an annual output of the value shown by these figures and an
investment of nearly four times that amount can justly demand the recognition
asked.
" It has been sa!d that we as a nation have too many departments and secretaries
now. Ido not thinK so. Any way, as our Government is constituted it is necessarily
a part of governmental functions that the affairs of the country shall be admin:stered
by a Presidential Cabinet, and it is in order lor the miner> of California, of ihe coast,
ai;d of the entire nation, to recognize this fact and unite in a manful request lor just
recognition. It is by and throneh Cabinet otlicers that justice is secured and interests
fostered, and it is the way those things will be done. The creation of a Cabinet officer
to be known as tiie Secretary of Mines and Mining is in direct line with the policy and
outgrowth that has made the Cabinet. At first the Cabinet of the President of the j
V ni ted States was composed only of a Secretary of State, a Secretary of War and a I
Secretary of the Navy. In this century have been added, successively, a Secretary of
the Interior, an Attorney-General, a Postmaster-General and a Secretary of Agricul
ture. In the order of evolution or development the time has now arrived for a Secre
tary of Mines and Mining.
"Any intelligent man in or out of the minine business who will note the trend of
' s fairs during the past decade will be likely to give aliirmative echo to the statement
-hat the creation of a Cabinet officer to have charge of the country's mining industries
is not only of im mediate necessity to the miner but of present; importance to the
interests of the Nation in its entirety. This great mining industry is, so far as Gov
ernment charge is concerned, a little dump in the corner of the office of the Secretary
of the Interior. The ignorance displayed by that department is lamentable. With
no disposition to find fault or to blame, with the most merciful standard of criticism,
1 enn only say that, as at present constituted, the only Cabinet connection this
Government has with its createst basic industry is a prejudiced subordinate official in
the Land Department, who, left to his own devices and questions of personal privilege,
allows unworthy influence to govern his actions, and who makes absurd and injurious
rulings in ignorance or defiance of the plainest requirements of the mining public.
This man and his attendant satellitei kuow nothing of mining. It is not their fault,
but it is our misfortune.
"Take a common experience. Every day comes up a point involving interpreta
tion of that maze of modern mystery, the mining laws of the United States. A letter
to the Secretary of the Interior will bring a construction or ruling on a disputed point,
and a letter to the Commissioner of theÂ»General Land Office will bring a ruling or de
cision on the same point exactly opposite to that of his superior. If the matter is
pushed or the divergence of opinion pointed out, the impression is conveyed in sub
sequent official correspondence that the miner is a nuisance, always' bothering and
disturbing official ease.
"We need a new department of the Federal Government â the Department of
Mines and Miningâ with a competent man in charge as a Cabinet officer of equal
standing with the other members of the Cabinet I don't care whether he hails from
California or Colorado, or North Carolina, so he has sufficient knowledge and author
ity to correctly conserve the mlnirvg interests and administer the great affairs with
which his office would be charged. There are a great many things in the mining
world that need straightening out, and they never will receive due attention or proper
â¢ solution till there is a Cabinet officer of mines and mining. It is hard enough at best
for the miners of this country without having things made harder still. Between the
grab of the corporations and the merciless ignorance of those in power the miner has
little show for justice. If the miners of this country (and that term is meant to in
clude every one directly connected with the mining industry) will work together in a
united demand for such recognition as that originally suggested by the Mining and
Scientific Press â a Cabinent department for the Government and fostering of the
mining industry â it will be forthcoming."
Continuing Mr. Halloran said:
"The United States Government has done less for mining than for any other in
dustry. There is not to-day to be found in Washington a single clerk to represent
that great industry. The miners do not ask that the Government tn this matter ren
der any assistance to mining; only that it awaken to present requirements and assist
itself. All the miners ask is that such action be taken as will decrease rather than in
crease the expenses of the Government, The Geological Snrvey, aside from its educa- j
tional value, is of little use to any industry except mining, and that is \inder the !
Treasury Department. Sd with other bureaus that miners have to do with. Any
tiling that affects the miner is in a detached condition under the heads of different
departments that are not in sympathy with nor interested in mining.
"The miners are the cause and primary factor in the building up of the country
westward from the 104 th meridian. But for them this whole region would not be even
so lar developed, and the other great industries of this part of the nation would be but
little advanced to-day from their rudimentary condition in the early '50' ?. A senso of
gratitude should induce the United States Government to grant such a request as that
embodied in the resolution I had the honor to draft and submit at tha recent conven
tion of the California State Miners' Association, and which was unanimously adopted.
I refer to that which was made the text of the udmirablo front-page illustration in
the issue of The Cam. of the 16th inst. The miners have contributed more to the
wealth of the country and done more toward its development, with less return, than
any other class of people. They have gone ahead as pioneers, asking no aid nor sub
sidies, and to-day we pass in palace-cars across the way they blazoned white with
their bones. Nor do they now ask for any assistance. They do not appear as beggars;
but without trespassiug upon any of the prerogatives of other industries they with
dignity suggest to the Federal Government what the business requirements of the time
demand.
"Our country leads in many important respects, yet in this we are behind other
Civilized nations. In Great Britain, France, Russia and Germany, with less reason
than in ours, are Government department? of mining, ministers of mines, whose
business it is to look out for that industry, and the effects of such_ Governmental
supervision are too manifest to require more than allusion.
"It is the duty of the Government to see that the great sources of National wealth
are not wasted. Yet the United States Government has been almost criminally negli
gent in this respect. Countless millions have been irretrievably lost in mines by
reason of such neglect. At a small cost for gathering information and supplying it
to miners, securing modification and adjustment of conflicting laws, much of this loss
could be prevented.
"The horizon of the future widens. It is manifest that however deferred this
ninttor may be it must come. Nothing is ever settled till it is settled right, and while
I am always willing to concede ;o others the same degree of consistency that I claim
for myself, I confess to a,slight degree of impatience at adverse comment on this
bill j-ct.j -ct. The taÂ«k is not an easy one. It will take concerted effort, unity of interests,
a combination of forces East and West, education of the public mind, favorable con
sideration of officials in and out of Congress, and a general realization of the justice
of the proposed measures. If we ns miners can secure favorable public opinion and
show cause for maintaining this idea and practical reason for its fulfillment, the re
sult will be satisfactory. 1 think we can."
CAMINETTI FOR A CABINET PLACE FOR MINING.
Ex -Congressman Caminetti said yesterday that the bill in
troduced in the Miners' Convention was a copy of one intro
duced by him. Coming from a mining region himself he had
taken, and was still taking, great interest in all matters pertain
ing to the mines of this State, and he had long ago become con
vinced that a Federal Department of Mining and a Mining Sec
retary were imperatively necessary for the welfare of that
industry. It was just as much a necessity as were the Depart
ment and the Secretary of Agriculture. There was no reason
why, if agriculture should be represented in the Cabinet, mining
"should not be.
PREPARING FOR CHRISTMAS.
How an Amateur Photographer May
Make J'retly and â  l'neful Present*. â¢
The amateur photographer, if he , has
improved the shining hours of summer by
gathering some - good negatives, has 1 on
hand the material for very acceptable
Christmas, gilts, and now is the time to
set about preparing them. -,
.No , amateur has probably, been Âso for
tunate as to secure a satisfactory picture
with every plate used The prodigal
throws these spoiled . plate v in the ash
barrel, but 7 the wise amateur uses them
lor many things. One way is to use them
for mounting ; prints. Carefully mounted
' finished, they are veiry pretty and
wake handsome ornament?, and for sim-
T^ Kifts are far more satisfactory, than the
usual Christmas cards, which eventually
find "their way into â -, the ', scrap basket.
Then, too, another thing which commends
them to a young person vrho must make a
little money go a long way is that they '>
are very much cheaper. ;; i , v
Soak the spoiled plate in hot water till
all the film has been removed, then wash
it in hot suds, dry and noiisli it with
French chalk and a piece of soft chamois.
Select the prints to be mounted, choosing
those which will have some especial at
traction to the one for whom you intend
the gift. .Soak the prints lor a few min
utes in a weak solution of glycerine, using
one-quarter ounce of glycerine to sixteen
ounces of water. Lny them face un on a
piece of glass and let the water drain off
but do not blot them. Have your glass
ready, place the print face down on it
and, covering it with a piece of blotting!
paper, squeeze it to the glass, using the
I rubber roller made for this purpose.
The picture must adhere to the glass at
| every point; for if it does not the' air
busters will show and disligure the pic
ture. By examining the face of the print
iromtho glass side it can easily be seen
whet her the optical contact is perfect and
if not, rub it u^trfit is.
Cut a piece of stout manila paper half
an inch larger all round than the glass
Lay the glass in the center of the paper
and a small square from each corner of the
paper. Remove the picture, coyer the
paper with paste, and paste it on the edges
on to the face of the glass, tbo squares cut
trcm the corners allowing it to lie smooth

TJMJK SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1896.
The British Tramp Steamer Amarapoora as She Appeared Last Monday With a Big List to Port.
She Was Ready to Sail for Central American Ports but Is Still at Anchor as the
Underwriters Refuse to Insure Either Vessel or Cargo.
THE AMARAPOORA
IS IN TROUBLE
Although Now on an Even
Keel No One Will
Insure Her.
Narrow Escape of the British
Ship Con way Castle on
Pillar Point
Death of an Alaskan Gold Miner
While on His Way Home From
Co>ks Inlet.
What will be done with the British
tramp steamer Amarapoora is still a mat
ter of doubt. The underwriters refuse to
insure her and in consequence the owners
of ihe cargo aboard will not allow the ves
sel to sail. That tne Amarapoora is top
heavy there can be no doubt.
All of Monday she lay in the stream
I with n list to port. Yesterday with the
transfer of several tons of cargo from port
to starboard she straightened ud and is
j now on an even keel. Every inch of space
;on the steamer has been utilized and a
\ schooner has been chartered to take away
Ihe freight left on Lombard-street wharf
which she could not carry. All day she
I lay witn steam up, but no satisfactory tin-
J derstanding could be reached, so the
Amarapoora had to remain at anchor.
She is one of the longest vessels in port
for her beam, being 350 feet long and only
20 feet broad, while her depth of hold is
11 feet. The chances are still that the
captain will have to dock her again and
j take off some of the deck load.
The smartest trip of the season from
Honolulu has been that of the barkentine
Skagit, that made the run to Port Town
j send in ten and a half days, thus beating
the Japanese steamer Kiushiu Maru by
twenty-four hours. The steamer sailed
ahead of the barkeutine, but the latter
beat her into l'ueet Sound.
The British ship Duncow is on her wav
here from Talcahuano to load wheat. Her
charterers iiave changed their mind, bow
ever, and all the pilots have instructions
to send her on to Port Townsend as soon
as tney speak her. Captain Graves of the
Duncow is well known m San Francisco,
having hee:i here on several occasions as
chief officer of the Cawdor.
President Colnon of tne Harbor Com
mission returned from Colusa yesterday.
He says the stone for the new ferry depot
is being got out quickly and in splendid
shape. There will be no delay on account
of tne stone and the building will be put
up in contract time. Mr. Colnon is well
satisfied with the progress that has been
made and will so report to the board at

fitted *ithÂ« new coirugated wheel. This
is. a new invention ami great things are
I expected from it. The propeller is just
the same as an ordinary one, only that
the blades are corrugated or waved the
same as the material used for roofing
buildings. On her preliminary spin me
tug did not do as wetl as with the old
wneei, but then she was Hying light ami
â  the propeller may not have got a good
i hold on the water. She will be given an
I official test this week and then the merits
| or demerits of the new invention will be
known.
The Norwegian bark Stjorn Is one of the
handsomest vesseN of her class in port
j and Captain Drye Halse is justly proud of
i her. The Stjorn was built in England,
bat is owned in Tved^strand, Norway, by
] a syndicate composed of about twet'uy
; fonr persons or more. The father of John
! Fjeren, assistant superintendent of the
( Sailors' Home, is part owner, anJ Captain
liaise himself has a considerable interest
in the vessel.

The British ship Con way Castle, that

Pillar Point. On the 17th inst., at !) a. m.,
she went ashore t:i a dense fog and bumped
over a dozen tunes. She was not off and
anchored in Halfnibon Hay. where a tvÂ«

The schooner Sophie Sutherland ar
rived in port from Alaska yesterday. On
the way down T. M. Milroy, a nai'ive of
Michigan, aged 27 years, died of con
sumption. He was one of the miners who
went to Cooks inlet to seek a fortune la^t
spring. While in Ban Francisco he had
plenty of money and was well known in
sporting circle?. The "gold craze" toek
hold of him and he joined one of the ex
peditions got up in Oakland. It is from
that on the same old story over again.
Gold was only found in very small quan
tities and finally the party broke up.
With nearly all his money gone and
broken down in health Milroy took pas
sage on the Sutherland and died on the
14th inst. The body was brought to San

The t aptaiii'.t Uucki on Ice.
An army officer stationed in Washing
ton is a summer widower just now. as his
better half aud the children are enjoying
the heated term at a watering place. The
officer, notwithstanding his entorced
term of bereavement, (iresses as immacu
lately as ever and is very fond of appear
ing in spotless linen, particularly in the
evening. When he came borne from his
daily labor the other afternoon the col
ored cook, for he keeps a bachelor hall,
approached him deferentially ana said:
"Cap'n. does ye want de ducks fer brek
fus, an' how doe? ye want 'em cookedâ
roas'ed or how?"
"Ducks!" exclaimed tne master of the
hons>e, in surprise. "I don't want any
ducks this time of year and I didn't order
any."
"Well, dey is heah jes de same. A man
brung 'em dis mawnin', and I said, "Wat's
dem? 1 and de man said, 'Ducks for de

Thereupon the captain was escorted to
the refrigerator and saw a very limp but
carefully tied bundle containing his new
white duck -suit, in which he intended to
appear that evening.
He didn't say much. â Washington Star.
A CHURCH FOR ST. JAMES.
Ihe Old 11 ill on Clement Street Will
Give 'VViiv to a Fine
Edifice.
St. James parish, now occupying a hall
on Clement street, near Sixth avenue, has
determined upon the erection of a new
church. A subscription was recently
started among the parishioners and re
sulted successfully.
St. James parish iÂ« the result of a mis
sion which was started by St. Paul's in
1890, when the Rev. F. J. Mynard was rec
tor. A lot with a frontage of fifty feet was
purchased on Clement street and a tem
porary guild hall erected. Succeeding
Rev. Mr. Mynard, the Revs. J. B. Eddie,
L. H. Church, Hobart Chetwood and
W. M. Reilly have at times officiated and
under these clergymen the parish has
made steady progress. In June of the
present year the bishop ot the diocese
appointed Rev. W. H. Claphara ns min
ister, and under his energetic and careful
guidance the congregation has very ma
i terially increased.
The new church will seat 250 people. It
will be of frame, and will cost not to ex
ceed $5000. The exterior will be exceed
ingly neat in design, while the interior
will be of pleasing architecture. In the
! bay at the front will oe ihe baptistry, and
; a deep recessed chancel with stalNfora
; large vested choir will occupy the rear
i portion of the church. The rector is de
termined that the new church shall be
paid for ns it progresses. For that reason
the plans have been made for tha erection
of a plain church. It is expected that the
present lot owned by the churrh will b<Â»
exchanged for one of wider frontage and
situated a few blocks west, so as to allow
for future growth.
The new Maria Kip Orphanage iÂ» situ
ated within the parish, and its 150 girls
will be under jthe spiritual direction of
the rector of St. James.
The officials of St. James parish are:
Warden, J. H. Richards; clerk. F. H.
Seely; treasurer, W. C. Wise, and with
Messrs. G. B. Ludlow, C. H. Hubbs, F. T.

One morning at Versailles in January,
1871, the letters from home were being
looked tnrougti while Moltke was present,
in one of them was a long poem in his
honor, full ot all imaginable eulogies, such
phrases as "The saee orderer of battles,"
"The great silent iu3n," etc., constantly
occurring. He sat quiet while this great
composition wa< being read out, and when
it was over he smiled calmly to hinnelf

San Francisco Legislative Delegates
Invited to Hear Proposed Meas
ures Discussed.
A largely attended meeting of the San
Francisco Association of Improvement
Clubs was held at B'nai B'rith Hall last
evening, Mayor-Elect Phelan presiding.
Many matters receive.! attention.
The first business was the admittance of
the North End Improvement Club to
membership. Mr. i'helan reported that
he had invited the Polk-street Improve
ment Club to apply lor membership.
Delegates from that club were present.
Various committees reported. The
committee on street railroads reported
an interview with Mr. Yining, at which
Mr. Vining was requested to have the cars
on Montgomery street turn out to the
right instead ot to the left. Mr. Vining
told the committee that a double-track
electric road would soon be put down on
Montgomery^street. The committee se
cured no promise that there would be any
change. A vote was adopted to send a
new committee to interview Mr. Vining.
Delegate Cahill reported that a com-
munication regarding a nuisance caused
by the Spalding Carpet- Cleaning Works,
which he had been instructed by the asso
ciation to send to the Board of Health,
had not been received by that body. This
matter and the respect due to the associa
tion were discussed Inter in the evening.
Judge yon Reynegom suggesting that if
the matter could not be reached in any
other way a suit might be in order.
Tne sense of the delegates, as finally ex
pressed, was that a committee should
once more take the communication to the
Board of Health and convey the informa
tion that if no action should be taken by
the board the suggestion of Judgo yon
Reynegom might be adopted.
A discussion took place concerning the
petition of the Southern Pacific Company
to be permitted to run at the rate of fif
teen miles per hour inside of Twenty-sixth
street, and thirty miles per Hour further
out.
George R. Fletcher said that this propo
sition contained a menace to the public.
While it was true that the company has
b'.'tn running trains at that speed right
along for some time the adoption of a
resolution legalizing it would relieve the
railroad company from a share of responsi
bility. He moved that the matter shouM
be referred to Uhe committee on street
railroads. Several speakers followed Mr.
Fletcher. Finally it was voted to instruct
the committee to oppose the adoption of
any ordinance to authorize any higher
rate of *Deed than the existing ordinance
sanctions.
Senator-elect Dwyer introduced the sub-
ject of the location of the Pesthouse. He
opposed having it located on the Ground
of the City and County Hospital. Lepers
were* sent here from* all over this State
und from all ov^r the United States. Peo
ple in that section did not want all the
lepers in the Unitei States sent among
them. The .-ssociation instructed the sec
retary to protest against the location pro
posed for the Pesthouse, and also went on
record in favor of asking the Legislature
to make the lerers a State charge.
Supervisor-elect Kottanzi offered resolu
tions Â«oncerning the site of the Wilmer
ding School, favoring a location south of
Market street ana not farther west than
Sixteenth street. This proposition was
discussed, but was not adopted, the mat
ter going over until the next meeting.
A resolution introduced by Dr. Salfield,
asking the Supervisors for an order that
all streetcars shall turn out to the right
when it shall be necessary to turn out
when passing, was refened to a committee.
Leon Samuels reported concerning the
Geary-street franchise. He considered tbe
interventiqn ot the Southern Pacific Com
pany in the suit of George R. Fletcher
against the Supervisors to be unauthor
ized, and said that tbe claim made by the
company that they were willing to sur
render the old franchise is not true. The
company never let go of anything it could
hold on to. He wanted instructions. The
association voted to leave the whole mat
ter to Attorneys Samuels and Baggett.

The Indianapolis Board of Trade de

what is the matter with Congress?
As it is announced that Bryan will pub
lish a book about himself and his cam
paign we may take it for granted that his
retirement from politics is to be perma
nent.
The Sacramento story of an airship seen
flying over the city at night is not wholly
credible, but it is the best explanation we
have had of tie complete disappearance
of David Bennett HilL
The Board of Ordnance and Fortifica
tions believes a war is about due in the
general run of things, and, while that is
not a basis for aiarm, it is a good enough
reason lor getting ready.
The most pleasing feature of the revival
of trade is that it shows nothing in the
nature of an artiticial boom. The coming
prosperity will have a solid basis and take
the form of legitimate industry.
It goes without saying the Assessors'
convention will gladly receive suggestions
on the subject of tax reform. Chambers
of Commerce and Boards of Trade should
lend a helping hand in the matter.
The frequent references in Chicago to
the fact that the registration in that city
was larger than that of New York are dis
missed with scorn in the latter place as
"tiresome and mattoidal iteration."
If there were any sure way of searching
out tbe course of Providence we might
discover that the Oregon floods were in
tended for tbe swallowing up the iniqui
tous generation that slandered San Fran
cisco.
As tbe Texas has had such bad luck at
sea we may derive some satisfaction from
tbe report that she stood tbe strain of tbe
docking without injury. Perhaps the
Naval Department may find some use for
her as a dock ornament.
The people will take note thst all Re
publicans are eager to enact a tariff bill
this winter to provide an adequate revenue
for the Government and that if such a bili
is not passed it will be tbe fault of the
Popocrat fusion in the Senate.
During October the expenditures of the
Government were more than $7,695,000 in
excess of income, wh.ch raises tbe total
deficit of the four months of this fiscal
year to above $32,889,000. In the face of
men figures ie would seem even Demo
cratic Senators wou.d Tote for the Din^ley
bill this win er, so as to provide a revenue
until a protective tariff can be enacted.
CURRENCY REFORM
The speeches made at the banquet of
the New York Chamber of Commerce and
the action of the Indianapolis Board of
Trade calling for a National convention ot
commercial bodies to consider our mone
tary problems make it evident that one
of the issues which will be forced upon the
attention of tbe next Congress will be that
of reforminc our system of currency.
The new issue will differ from that
which was appealed to the people in the
last campaign, inasmuch as it will affect
paper money rather than coin. The peo
ple decided at the late election in favor of
bimetallism, and expressed a resolution to
maintain the gold standard until an inter
national agreement could be made for the
free coinage of silver. We have now to go
forward to the further question of what
shall be done concerning the paper money
of the country.
There will be many plans suggested for
solving the problem which this issue pre
sents. All of these, however, may be
broadly div ded into two c.nssea. On the
one side will be those who favor some
means of main aining greenbacks, and on
tbe other will be thuse wno desire to retire
all forms of treasury notes and deliver our
paper money over to the management of
banks under National control.
It is too early to speculate at this time
concerning the forms which either of these
parties will propose for the solution of :he
problem. On t c one side it will be con
tended that as a certain amount of cur
rency is necessary for the transaction of
business it is the duly of the Government
to provide it. On the other side it will be
claimed that an money represents business
it should have an elasticity equal to that
of trade, and consequently the paper
money of the country should be issued
solely by banks; since, as tbe Government
is not engaged in business, it could not
issue a money which would automatically
expand or contract us the necessity of
business required.
"While it is not possible at this time to
forecast the future, it seems certain that
the Republican party will maintain the
greenback system, augmented by some
form of National bank notes. The pre
vailing system of paper money was estab
lished by the Kepublicans, and there is no
reason now apparent why the party of to
day should depart from the precedents
established in the past.
It has been evident for some time, how
ever, that our National bank system of
issuing paper money does not give us the
elasticity required. All notes issued have
been ba^ed upon bonds of the National
Government, and as these bonds have
diminished in amount aud in the rate of
interest paid they have ceased to furnish
a sufficient basis for our paper currency.
Some reform in the system therefore is
imperative.
It is to that problem the attention of the
people will now be called, and tbe chances
are it will form the dominant insne in our
politics for some time to come. It is cer
tainly advisable lhat the problem shouid
be solved during the new era of pros
perity and of Republican supremacy. It
would be an unfortunate thing for the
country if, for any reason, it were post
poned until it should be entangled with
other questions likely to arise and com
plicated by a disturbed condition of trade
and industry.
THE WILMERDING SCHOOL.
The decision of the Board of University
Regents to locate the WilmerdinÃ School
in this City will be received with general
satibfaction here, and after due considera
tion will be approved by the State &i laige.
The reasons for establishing the school
in this City are two. First, the founder of
the school was a citizen of San Francisco,
identilied with its interests for upward of
forty years and clearly intended that the
sctiool should be for the benefit of the
youth of this City. That much was made
evident by the testimony of the men who
knew him, who conversed with him con
cerning his proposed bequest and who,
therefore, knew clearly wtiat was his full
intention in regard to it.
The second reason, hardly less impor
tant than the first, is thnt San Francisco
is decidedly the proper place for such an
institution. It is in this City that it will
be within reach of the largest number of
young men who desire mechanical train
ing, and therefore it is clear that hero it
will be able to do the most good. The
number of persons who can profit by
the advantages of such a school In San
Francisco will De far in excess of the num
ber who could possibly make use of those
advantages if it were located elsewhere.
On the broad grounds of efficiency, there
fore, il was altogether right and prooer
for the Regents of the University to select
San Francisco as the place of location.
Now that it has been decided to estab
lish tbe school in this Jity, it is to be
hotÂ»ed that the work of construction will
be pushed rapidly forward. Boys who are
now of an age to reap the benefits of the
school are rapidly growing older, and if
the completion of the institution is lone
delayed they will be deprived of them
altogether.
There is no apparent reason why there
shouid be any delay, and we trust that no
disagreement as to the particular site to
be selected in the City will cause a post
ponement of the beginning ot the work of
construction. Since we are to have the
school, let us have it as speedily as possi
ble.
THE BRUSEWITZ AFFAIR.
The debate in the Reichstag on Tuesday
upon the Brusewitz affair shows in a
strong light tha excessive military despot
ism which prevails in Germany and the
extent to whicb not merely the rights
but the lives of citizens are subject to the
domination of the army.
The occurrence which gave rise to the
debate is one which could not have hap
pened in any other civilized country.
There seems to have been no dispute in
regard to the facts. Lieutenant Uruse
witz killed a German workman for no
other reason than that tbe workman had
accidentally brushed against him while
the lieutenant was drinking beer in a
cafe.
The defense of the lieutenant wno that
he considered that the King's uniform
had been tarnished by the touch of the
workingman to sucii an extent that he
was compelled to kill the offender, even
though the touch was that of mere acci
dent.
It hardly seems credible that the Ger
man Minister of War should in the Reich
stag have defended such an action.
Nevertheless that is exactly what he did.
He is reported to have said, "The honor
attached to wearing the King's uniform
and respect tor the colors are military
sentiments that we shall never abandon.
The right of self-defense must never be
taken from officers."
Such sentiments comine from such a
source on such an occasion in defense of
Bnch a crime naturally routed the indig
nation of the Liberals. Herr Bebel very
naturally a>ked, "How can it be said
that whoever attacks the Kng's uniform
thereby insults the King? Things will at
last come to such a pass that a uniform of
the cuirassiers of the guard will be sus
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1896.
pended like Gessler's hat, and the people
will be required to make obeisance to the
Emperor's horse."
It can hardly be doubted that tbe
Liberals express the real sentiments of
the German people in regard to the
Brusewitz outrage. The offender in thnt
case, although pronounced guilty by a
court-martial and sentenced to four years'
imprisonment and dismissal from the
army, has not yet been punished, as the
case was referred by the Emperor to the
Minister of War, and he may escape pun
ishment altogether. It would seem, there
fore, that tbe Kaiser thinks more of his
uniforms than he does of the lives of his
citizens.
Such tyranny cannot in the nature of
things prevail long among a people so
brave and so intelligent as the Germans,
and the a: tempt of the Kaiser to maintain
it is ominous to the peace of Europe. He
may yet find it necessary to engage in a
foreign war in onler to awasen among his
people a spirit sufficiently warlike to sus
tain him in the military domination
which he seems determined 10 enforce.
OUR COAST DEFENSES.
The annual report of the Board of
Ordnance and Fortifications, which
strongly urges the importance of in
creased appropriations for tho work of
placing our harbors in a proper state of
deiense in case of a sudden outbreak of
war, wiJl receive general approval.
The report contains the curious state
ment that while there is no present pros
pect of a war between this country and
any other nation, yet it is not altogether
improbable that such a war may occur.
The argument on which the statement is
based is as curious as the statement it
self. The report says:
The wars of nations occur in cycles of vary
ing length, but seldom does a generation pass
without a conflict. Already more than thirty
years hare elapsed since our last great war,
and another may occur soon if the past be a
guide to the future. One of the longest inter
vals of peace we hare ever enjoyed has oc
curred.
The argument that war is to be expected
because a war is about due will hardly
have much weight with t: c average citi
zen. It is entitled to consideration only
by reason of the high rank of the men
who urge it in an official state paper. It
is not sufficient to occasion alarm, but it
may perhaps be con3idereJ a good reason
why the work of coast defense and fortifi
cation should be carried vigorously for
ward.
As the board says: "A war if it come
at all will come without warning, and will
give no time for preparation." It is clear,
therefore, that if such a war should arise
between us and any power of sufficient
strength to exert a great naval force at the
outbreak of hostilities, many of our ports
under present conditions would suffer se
verely before we could arrange for their
adequate protection.
With a properly devised tariff, which
will yield a revenue adequate to the needs
of the Nation, it will be comparatively
easy for us to enter upon the work of pre
paring for war without imposing any se
rious burdens upon the people. Such a
tariff we may expect from the next Con
gress, and it is not unreasonable, to as
sume that with the enactment of a better
revenue law we shall also have the much
needed appropriations for coast defenses
and the upbuilding of the navy.
Certainly we cannot begin this work too
soon. It takes about three years to con
struct and equip a war vessel, and it takes
as much time also to provide the appli
ances for coast and haroor defense. The
earlier we begin the sooner will our ports
be secure, and for that reason the people
will give a cordial approval to the report
of the board urcing more liberal appropri
ations for these purposes.

whether she is really an accomplished vocal

Saint-Saens says he has renounced the thea
ter forever. "I do not want to compose any
more operas," he writes, "because the work is
too laborious, too long â in a word, too fatigu
ing for in>\ I can no longer pass long
months la writing music for eight hours a
day; neither my eyes nor my health can stand
it. I desire to consecrate myself exclusively
to works which, if they do not demand less
tension of Die mind, at least exact less physical
labor." Saint-Saens goes on to enumerate
sadly the operas which he has written and
which are awaiting an impresario. The com
poser of "Henry VIII" and "Samson aud De-
Ulah" has several other lyric dramas which no
one seems to appreciate, and he does not see any
use in adding to their numoer. On the other
hand, he says he is tormented for chamber
music, particularly quartets and violin solns.
This leads him to declare: "As for the theaterÂ»

SANITATION TWO CENTURIES AGO
To write of sanitary regulations and precau
tions two centuries or more ago would seem to
lomo people like copying the famous chapter
on snakes in Icelandâ "there are no snakes in
Iceland." It is instructive, therefore, to read
in the new periodical, Janus (Amsterdam,
October), devoted to the history of medical
science, an article by Dr. Charles Fiessinger, j
in which he details the extraordinary precau
tions taken in French cities at that period in
time of epidemic, some of these, to be sure,
seem a little ridiculous in the light of modern
science, Dut in the main they were dictated by j
sound common-sense. Dr. Fieasinger copies j
from an old print a picture of a curious old i
pesthouse dress, and he begins his article by I
describing it as follows:
"A carnival costume: A leather mask cover
ing the head and neck and simulating a bird's
head with its round eye and long beak; the
mask topped with a hat like an ecclesiastic's,
and continuing down to the level of the
shoulders; a child's dress fallingto the ankles;
the hands lost to view in enormous gloves; in
the right hand a long rodâ in such a rig as I
this our fathers were accustomed 10 visit pest
houses. An engraving of the period gives us
a full description of this toilet. Tbe eye is of
crystal; the beak is a long nose filled with
odoriferous substances; the mask, the robe and
the gloves are of Levant morocco. This was
an admirable method of guarding against con
tagion by the poison of the platcue, which is
; communicated by the touch or the breath ; the
Levant morocco and the beak full of perfumes
keep it out.
"But in time of epidemic remedies are not
all; the magistrates must also do their part;
drugs are all right, but we must have severe
police regulations along with them.
"In cities menaced with the plague, then,
was instituted a council of health. The first
act of the council was to elect a captain of

health, whose duty it was to carry out its
edicts. He visi;ed the dead with tne phvsl
cians and surgeons anu superintended 'the
quarantine imposed on men and goodÃ. This
camain of health, ot whom satis actory bo Us
were required, had a force of guards under
his orders.
'No beggars were allowed in the streets, no
dirt or filth; there was a regular service of
carts to carry off dirt, dead animals, etc. ; lime
| was used freely for disinfection.
I "Pure air was regarded as a necessity, hence
j the trades ;hat befouled it were banished :r m
the city; such were the candle-makers, who
were allowed t<> carry on their business only
in secluded spots.
"All these precautions would be but a doubt
ful aid If b vigilant watch were not kept on
the city gates; no one was. allowed to enter
unless he bore a cert.fica eoi health. On sus

The premature explosion of a blast
where seme grading is being done on
Railroad and Twentieth avanues. yester
day af lernoon, came near costing two men
their lives, and has probably cost one his
eyesight.
Frank B. Harm and Alexander .Tack
son, both in the employ of John Kelso,
who has the grading contract, were the
sufferers. They had finished drilling a
hole for a particularly Jaree blast and had,
as is often done, ex Joded a quantity of
black powder down at tho bottom. This
is done to enlarge the powder space for
the bla-.tin? charge, which makes the ex
plosion much more effective.
It is supposed the men dm not wait long
enough after the di>charge of the black
powder before rammini! home the full
charge of blasting powder, lor as that was
being driven down it exploded with ter
rific force.
Jackson was putting the powd r in the
ho c and Harm was tamping it down.
When it exploded the ramrod was blown
irom Harm's hands and the partially
rammed powder charge blew out of the
hole as irom a gun barrel. It struck
Harm in the face and drove stones and
dirt deep into the flesh. His face was
terribly burned by the flame, the flesh was
partly torn from the bones of his forearm,
and two of his fingers were blown nearly
from his hand.
Jackson fared better. He was badly
burned about tbe face and hands, but was
not lacerated so badly as bin companion.
Both men were taken to the City and
County Hospital. There the doctors de
rided that there is very little hope for
Harm's eyesight. His eyes were nearly
blown from their sockets, and it is not
supposed that he will ever see acain. It
is fortunate that both were not killed.

Julian Says That Corbel t Must Fight
to a Finishâ Betting on
Fights
Bob Fitzsimmons is losing no sleep over
the prospect of meeting Corbett in a finish
fight in New York. Julian, his manager,
Dal Hawkins*
said yesterday that the offer which wa<t
made by the Bohemian Club was very
generous, but unless the Bohemians ran
arrange for a finish contest they will n->t
have the pleasure of seeing Fnzsinimons
and Corbett battling for the champion
ship.
"I have repeatedly notified the Eastern
Harry Fianick.
sportine writers that the next time that
Bob and Jim meet it mu*t be to a finish,"
.said Julian, "and judging from the present
outlook it seems to me that the only per
son who can handle the match is Dan
S uart, who recently obtained a conces
sion for a clubbouso near Paso del Norte,

just over the border, where finish lights
can be foupht without any fear of interfer
ence from the authorities.
"I will not consent to any limited con
test between Fitzsitr.mons and Corbett. It
must be a mill to a finish or nothing, and
that is my ultimatum."
Seats for the Carrol' and McAuliffe and
the Fitzsimraons and Sharkey tights will
be on sale to-day at M. A. Gunst's two
jtores and also at Michalitscbke's store on
fdarKet street.
Tom Sharkey is now taking lizht exer
cise. He has a punching bag on which is
painted the features of his opponent, Hob
Fitzsimmons. Tom says that he can
"nail" the point of Bob's jaw every time
he swings his big right at the bag, and
that instead of gome down from a punch
it flies up to the ceiling and comes back at
him smiling.
"But, of course," said Tom. "all pic
tures have a tendency to go up, but when
I hit the chin of the original you can bet
that something will be heard to drop."
The betting on the Carr li and McAuliffe
fieht favors the latter. Hawkins is a fa
vorite over Finnick. Some pnvate wagers
Have been made on the Sh rkey and Fitz

best figures obtainable.

distinguish persons and things.
Dr. William E. Ritter, associate profes
sor of biology at the State University,
commenting on the practicability of the
X ray in re-storing sight, said last night:
"If the statements with regard to the
use of the X ray in dissipating gloom
from the eyes of the blind are true, and I
bee no reasonable ground for doubt, the
discovery will be of immeasurable impor
tance.
"It is a fact that the optic nerves de
generate and regenerate under certain
conditions. Whenever there is a stimulus
to the optic nerve the result is light.
Then it is quite reasonable to believe that
if the X ray penetrated the region of the
eye to a sufficient extent the result would
be that light would appear to the eye of
the patient, providing, of course, that he
was not stor.e-bund anti that every ele
ment which enters into the production of
sight was not destroyed. Any other gal
vanic light besides the cathode ray could
produce this light-giving result.
"The chief utility which I see in the X
ray when used in the attempt to restore
sight is the bare possibility of its stimu
lating the optic nerve to a growth which
I m ght result in the permanent restoration
of sight. I say this very guardedly, and
can go no farther than mentioning it as
one of the possibilities.
"In the article on Edison's experiments
no mention is made about seeing anything
but light. I hope that his experiments
will result in seeing objects.
"It appears to me that the results to be
obtained by the use of the ray will depend
largely upon the nature and â¢ xient of the
disease of the eye. There might be no
end to speculation on the possibilities in
store for tbe experimenters, but even if
nothing further can be done witn the
blind than to enable them to clearly see
ligiit a great stride in scientific advance
ment will have been made."
A. Van der Naillen, who has given the
Roentgen ray considerable study here and
in France, was not surprised at the an
nouncement that Edison had made two
blind men see light by the X ray. He
said :
"X rays are gome to develop marvelous
discoveries soon. My son Ralpn handles
tbe fluoroscope in the laboratory, and the
rays have had a wonderful effect upon
him. His hairs have fallen out from the
backs of his hands and tbe naila have
dropped off his ringers through constant
use of the instrument during two months.
This shows the intense physiological influ
ence the rays have upon the human body.
The rays penetrate the innermost parts of
the body. Thus it behooves doctors to
take the most earnest interest in those
rays. To the physician's domain belongs
a thorough investigation of those myste
ries, because it is no longer a matter of
mere curiosity, but one of deep scientific
concern.
"If tne rays can kill that capillary cell
in which the hair is rooted, why would it
not be worth while to investigate their
action upon those abnormal growths, such
as cancer, tuberculosis ana kindred dis
eases?
"In France they nre wide awake to the
importance of the X ray, and we must not
look upon it as a curiosity. In every
French hospital is a special radiographer.
Every surgical case almost is first tested
by the X ray. M. Chapuis, professor of
physics in the Ecole Central, made exten
sive photo-radiographic investigations of
many diseases. He ascertained that the
kidney is relatively opaque, much more
bo than the muscles, because of the pres
ence of chlorides, phosphates and urates
disseminated through its entire mass.
"The calculi which the kidney contains
are also formed of phosphates, urates with
uric acid, but these existing in a con
densed form in the calculi are less per
mpable to the X rays, hence their exist
ence is revealed by a well-defined dark
spot on the radiograph. With the biliary
vesicle it is different, however, for it con
tains various opaque substances, while the
calculi in them are composed of pure chol
esterine, a substance relatively transpa
rent, which gives to the space occupied by
these calculi the appearance of cavities on
the photo-radiograpb. He detected tuber
culosis even in small swellings on fingers.
"With regard to the reported discovery
of Mr. Edison 1 cannot speak at present,
but the possibilities of the Roentgen ray
are such that one might believe almost
anything of it. If anybody in San Fran
cisco wishes to make such experiments I
will place my apparatus at his service."

Congressman W. R. Ellis of Oregon
arrived yesterday on his way to Washing
ton, accompanied by Mrs. Eilb. It is the
first time in thirteen years that Mr. Ellis
has been here, end then he was on his way
to Oregon from lowa, where he had lived
nearly his entire life.
He settled at Heppner, in Eastern
Oregon, in a rich farming and sheep-grow
inp country. When he had been there
seven years he was elected to Congress,
was re-elected, and now for the third time
CONGRESSMAN W. R. ELLIS of Oregon, Now at the Grand,
Who Has Just Been Elected for the Third Time.
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artist. \
he has been elected. Mr. Â£Ui3 is ol heavy
build, has blue eyes, a full dark beard and
is about 45 years old.
The Congressman says that never before
was there such a fight wageci in Oregon as
during the recent campaign. There were
speakers out all the time, and Mr. Ellis
took a very lively part in the fray.
"\Ve carried my district, which is the
second, by 4000 majority for McKinlev,"
said He, "but ove"r in the Willamette they
went back on u<, brincins; in a Democratic
majority of about 1700. This left the
State to the Republicans by about 2300.
"My Congressional district embraces all
â¦â Ast of tbe Cascade Mountains, except
Lake and Klamath counties and the river
counties of tbe Columbia west of the Cas
cades. The wool industry is very im
portant in it. and the question of the tariff
was a great issue in the campaign. Silver
did not cut. so much of a iignre. except
along the edges of Nevada and Idaho in
Oregon.
"Business has improved a good deal in
Oregon lately. It. has a very much
healthier tone. Sheep have advanced
10 and 20 cents a head and wool, is
going up. There is a bright outlook for
the State. The Oreeon Legislature will
elect a United States Senator this winter,
and in my judgment Senator Mitchell will
be elected to succeed him. The Senator
continues very popular. He did some
great work in the recent campaign. He
was speaking everywhere.
"I think the Pacific Coast should sec a
member in the ne^t Cabinet. The position
shouid be the Secretaryship of the In
terior or the Postmaster-Generalship. We
have no pronounced candidates in Oregon,
but suppose there may be yet. However,
lhe coast should be represented.
"Then in Oregon we would like to see
the Dingley bill become a law. We would
like to see the tariff raised temporarily on
wool, lumber and some other things till
the McKiniey bill could be passed, if we
could get the Dingley bill, though, it
would give us the temporary relief we
need.
"There is one other thing that Oregon
would like to see accomplished this win
ter in Congress, and that is the passage of
a bill pensioning veterans of all Indian
wars prior to and including the year 1850.
There are about 2000 ex-veterans and their
widows on the Pacific Coast. I think it is
time something was done for them, and I
am going to try to g?t it this winter. The
pension desired is $12 a month.
"Besides these two bills we, of course,
want to aid In every way we can the Nica
ragua ranal.''
Congressman and Mrs. Ellis, after re
maining here a few days, will visit the Yo
semite, and will then go to Los Angeles
lor a short time.. They will reach Wash
ington about December li, just before the
opening of Congress.

CYCLERS IN TRAINING
Saturday's Meetâ The Koad Club ami
I .ii City Club' linn* and Pool
â  : Toiiriiament Next Week. r â 
A large number of racers are in active
daily training for the opening meet at the
new Velodrome track next Saturday.
\\e\ls and his trainer (Aylward) have
come up from San Jose, and another re
cent arrival is W. E. Becker of Minneapo
lis, who won the five-mile National cham
pionship at the League .of American
Wheelmen's annual meet in - Louisville
last August, the event which many will
remember was won by the Eastern crack
erjact.. C. M. Murphy, on the San Jose
track in November, 1893, when he defeated
Bald and Cooper, and wen what was prob
ably the most interesting and bitterly con
tested event ever sesn in California.
There will be an immense crowd at the
meet Saturday if the advance sale of seats
is any criterion. The sport should be of
the best, as all the crack riders of the
coast are entered, and several from the
East. The track is perfectly saf->, being
six laps to the mile, well banked all the
way around, and is so scientifically con
structed that it actually inducas speed.
It is built of boards, and it is well known
that a board track is faster for cyclers than
either cement or earth.
The management contemplates holding
another meet on Thanksgiving day, and
entry blanks are already out providing for
a mile handicap, amateur, two-thirds
mile open professional, two mile handi
cap professional, besides the Velodrome
shield race, a match race between two
prominent riders, and a match tandem ,
race. The programme is good, though it i
would seem that with the usual holiday
crowd at the intercollegiate football game j
and the hor-e races, the crowd that would
attend bicycle races that day would not I
be very la rue.
The members of the Golden Gate and j
Waverly cycling ciubs mourn the loss of
a very prominent and popular member, P.
J. Hyde, who died suddenly a few days
ago. lie was well known in the cycling ,
world, and wa-i a delegate to the asso- j
ciated ciubs and the Whethnen's Muni- I
cipai League.
C. i. McLeod, a well-Known wheelman
of Solano County, is in the City on a visit j
and will remain ior the races Saturday.
Captain Day has called a run of the Hay i
City Wheelmen to Laundry Farm for next â 
Sunday. It is a pretty trip, a short and '
enjoyable ride, and a good dinner will
await the tourists at their destination.
There is a big entry list for the club's pool j
tournament, which commences next Mon- i
day evening. The handicaps have not yet
been announced, but th*Â» scratch men will
probably be PiKe, Fred Day. Spalding and '
Bob Terrlh.
The San Francisco Road Club will have 1
a moonlight run to-morrow night to Sutro |
Baths. Sunday next Captain Lewis will |
lead the members on a blind run, for j
which lie promises some pleasant sur- j
prises. The club will give its first annual I
dance Thursday evening, December 10, at j
Union-square Hall.
H. A. Geddard left for the East Monday i
night, being preceded a day by his fellow- !
member of The Bay City Wheelmen', R. J
Van Zandt. Both will to to London for j
the annual cycle show there in December. !

TIIE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1896.
TO FIGHT FOR '
THE CRAVEN DEED
Lawyers Are Now Lining
Up for the Next Big
Battle.
Mrs. Craven and Her Principal
Witnesses Meet for
Consultation.
Judge Slack Has Appointed Three
Appraisers to Inventory the
Fair Estate.
The legion of lawyers in the Fair estate
litigation are forming new lines and al
liances for new struggles over the late
Senator's millions, now that the pencil
will has passed out of the complication.
The special administrators, W. K. Good
fellow, James S. Angua and Thomas R.
Crothers, and their counsel, will stand
svith the heir^ and their counsel in oppos
ing the suit of Nettie R. Craven to recover
possession of the Mission and Pine street
properties, while they are opposed to each
other in the contest cer the trust clause
in the probated will, for the administra
:ors are also the trustees.
All sorts of dire things are being said
jrith regard to those deeds and the claim
ints under them. It is asserted that the
ictivity of the Police Department, begun
n anticipation of the trial of the will con
est. will be continued in the matter of the
â¢laims under the deeds held by Mrs. Cra
:fn for the Missson and Pine street prop
erties. It is alleged that the police have
ividence going to show that the deeds are
orgerie?, and that this evidence will be
brought before the Grand Jury.
On the other hand, the counsel for Mrs.
> aven declare that should this action be
aken it would pleaso them to meet and
inswer the charges on those lines as well,
f not betier, than upon any other.
"The same principle is involved in the
ieeds as in the will," they say. "The
counsel for Charles Fair piled up stacks of
xpert testimony to our hand when they
>r oduced and espoused the pencil will,
is they did up to a very recent date and
mtil the trust clause ot tbe pencil will
lad been decided invalid. The resources
if the City in the matter of experts and
nends of Fair familiar with his hand
writing were airnost exhausted to show
hat it was genuine wruiug of his own.
Lhat evidence is still there. It will be a
trange spectacle to see thsra now bring
ng charees ol forgery in face of that evi
lence, supported by some other expert
â¢vidence eoing to show that it is not
fair's signature."
It is not claimed that the deeds, which
ire als-o written in pencil, were drawn Dy
senator Fair himself. So far from being
in element of weakness it is cited as one
)f strength by the counsel for Mrs.
Graven, for they will introduce as a wit
less the man who wrote them, said to be
1 gentleman of high standing and a
arailiar friend of Senator Fair. The
lame of the person to whom the property
was to be deeded was not written by this
person, a space being left for it arid in
(vhich the name of Mrs. Craven was after
wards inserted. The experts imported
from the Kast will, therefore, direct their
itteniion toward the signature, "James
3. Fair."
The experts, Messrs. Ames and Car
ratho, have taken a room in the Parrott
milding, adjoining the olfices of Knight
t Haggerty and Charles Fair, and with
Lhe most improved appliances are at
work.
"They had not been in the office twenty
minutes before they were able to point
Diit convincing discrepancies in the pen
cil will," said George Knight yesterday.
"They will do the same thing with the
leeds. We have provided microscopes
thai allow nothing to get away. They
cost the neat sum of $2000, but i*t is won
derful the work they 00. Talk about toe
X rayâ the work of" these instruments is
almost as remarkable. No, it is absurd
for tbe plaintiffs in this ejectment suit to
?xpect to win by merely getting behind a
notarial seal. I may say that the claim
of Notary Cooney for damages for the al
legation of forgery by Cnarles Fair is al-o
absurd, as he will doubtless discover be
fore all this litigation is concluded."
It is known that Fair has a number of
private detectives in his employ working
on this matter, and one of them was over
heard to say in so many words and speak
ing of this matter, "We have the Grand
Jury all rinht, anyhow."
The counsel for Mrs. Craven are busy
preparing for the trial of the ejectment
sait t which they expect will be reached
early in January. They are eager for
trial, they say, and would like to tÂ»r:ng on
the issue earlier, but that the crowded
state of Judge Slack's docket prevents.
They had a consultation with the princi
pal-* yesterday, Mrs. Craven, Mr. Roberts
and Mr. Williams being present.
With regard to the suit of Fair again -t
Angus, to establish the status of the trust
clause of the probated will, it is under
stood that the opposing counsel have
agreed upon a means of getting* to Ihe
Supreme Court as quickly as possible with
that question.
While Judge Slack has decided the trust
clause invalid with regard to- real prop
erty, judgment has not been given, and
therefore an appeal could not be taken,
it is understood that under this agree
ment Charles Fair will be placed on the
stand on Tuesday, when the case cornea
up before Judge Slack, a few questions
Will be asked him and then judgment will
be asked, given and an appeal taken.
The heirs of the Fair estate are losing
no time in the matter of securing to them
selves their own under the will allowed to
go to probate last Monday.
Upon their application Judge! Slacs yes
terday appointed three appraisers of tue
estate, <vho were no sooner appointed
than they began their work of placing val
ues upon the big property.
The appraisers are Richard V. Dey, Gus
lave L. Brcsse and Ernest A. Leigh.
Dey is the choice of the heirs". He for
many years occupied the closest of busi
ness relations with the late Senator, being
his private secretary and companion in a
tour of the world. He has been the busi
ness agent of the estate for tonic years
and was one of the executors of the will of
Mrs. Fair.
Gustavo L. Bresse is a bi other of the
late Eueene W. Bresse, who was named
as one of the trust >es of the probated will
and who Was Senator Fair's private secre
tary at the time of the millionaire's death.
Mr. Bresse was selected by the special ad*
ministr&tors of the es'ate, Goodfellow,
AnÂ«us and Crothers.
Ernest A. Leigh was chosen by Judge
Slack to represent tbe Probate Court in
listing the property and placing valua
tions upon it. Mr. Leigli is a member of
the real estate firm of Davidson & Liigh.
The appraisers met yesterday and began
the preliminary work of taking an inven
tory of the estate.
Challenges the Orand Jury.
Altorhey C. B. Darwin has given notice to
Judg'_> Dainjjerrield that he desires to chal
lenge the legality and fairness of the Grand
Jury that returned an indictment for criminal
i bl Hgniiist Frederick Marriott fjr publishing

been ierved on ihe grand jurors, and they
have' been instructed to appear in Judve

o'clock to answer questions in regard to the
point raised by Mr. Marriott's attorney.
WINE-MAKEKS' MEETING,
I Last Year's Vintageâ The Price Set at
Not Less Than Twenty Cents
Per Gallon.
Tne annual meeting of the California
i Wine-makers' Corporation took place in
the Chamber of Commerce yesteiday,
President H. Bendel of the board of di
rectors presiding. The attendance was
large, almost theeutiremembership being
present, and 1025 shares out of the 1124
being represented.
President Bendel in his opening address
spoke of the flourishing condition of the
corporation which has united the wine
makers in a solid body, and the result
was that they have been enabled to com
mand better prices for their wins. By
their unity they had emerged from the
tender mercies of the buyer, who hereto
fore could set a price and the maker had
to submit.
During the last year over 10,000,000 gal
lons, including sweet wines, were ex
| poned, while the coast consumption was
(i.000.000. Deduct 4.000,000 for sweets and
1S,(X)O,OCO gallons are required for market.
Only 10,000,000 gallons have been pro
| duced this year to supply the demand.
I i he present crop of sweet wine is remark
ably short, probably not exceeding 2,000.
-000 gallons exclusive of muscat.
The report of J. H. Wheeler, secretary
and manager of the corporation, states
that the membership has increased from
185 to 21". The wine of the Uf> vintage de
livered consisted of 5,09:2,673 gallons of red
and 417,219 gallons of white; transferred
to tiie corporation ia audition to the
above 2. Â« 13, 000 gallons, from which, have
been deducted for sale 964,050 gallons.
The defective wine amounts to less than
150.000 gallons. Extra or superior wines !
sold at an advance over standard price,
120,000 gallons.
Manager Wneeler referred in his report
to the marked reduction of the expenses
of the corporation and the advantages to
the corporation by the return of the sellers
to the wine association. There have been
no losses, although the corporation has
handled over half a million dollars in
loans on wine. The classification of wines
has been Je!t to competitive buyers, and the
poor products of the year, as shown by
the defective report, is exceedingly sruali.
I The report also rpferred to the dividend re-
I cently declared by the corporation oi $G
! per snare.
During the year 1897 loans will be made
on the usual transfer, even though the
! wine be placed in the reserved column,
I when accompnnied by the insurance
1 policy and an affidavit to the effect that
I the wine is free irom other incunibranceÂ«,
; and belongs entirely to the member. In
ternst in auvance has been reduced from
it to 8 per cent per annum, and no sub
scribed stock is required, as the corpora
tion has now funds sufficient to supply its
j members in full of its requirements. The
expense contributed of % of a cent per
I gallon, which is half the usual brokerage
; charged, is th* only expense attached to
j wine passing through the corporation.
The pric of new wines was discussed at
! length and a resolution unanimously
' adopted recommending that the board of
! directors set the figures at not less than 20
cents per gallon.
The following directors were elected for
the coming year: H. lienrtel. president;
P. C. Rossi, vice-president; J. 11. Wheeler,
secretary and manager; 13. W. Paxton,
treasurer; C. F. Monteaiegre, W. B. Ran
kin, D. M. Deimas, H. B. Chase, Joseph
W. Hotchkiss, the latter being a new di
rector Irom Healdsburg. A resolution
was adopted commending tue services of
retiring director A. Sbarboro.
The new board of directors will meet
next Wednesday forenoon.
DRUNK TOR TWO YEARS.
Sirs. O'Connor Tells of the Wild Career
of Her I. ute Husband.
Mrs. Francis Adelaide O'Connor, widow
j of the late Jeremiah O'Connor, satin Judge
j Coffey's court yesterday and explained why
she thought Mr. O'Connor was of unsound j
1 mind when he made his will, her name j
being left out of that interesting document
j altogether.
Mrs. O'Connor testified that she was
1 married in ISS9 and for about two months
her married life was happy, although Mr. |
O'Connor was her second husband. The i
; first quarter of the year had scarcely 'â 
1 passed when her lord began to drink to
excess. He would abuse her when he was
drunk, she said, pulling her about the j
floor by the hair, knocking her down, lock- I
; ing her out doors at night and in other j
I ways treated her brutally when she refused '
! to get whisty for him. She said that in
I the last two years of her life he was so I
' t drunk that he oiten did not know where
: he was.
Huch treatment palled on her, Mrs. j
J O'Connor said, and she left her husband's
: bed and board, but as the fault was all his,
! she thought she ought to have a share of
the property.
Attorney Kalloch was curious to know !
how much liquor the lamented Mr. |
I O'Connor waÂ«i able to consume. The '
widovv said that he always brought home j
a bottle if tie was downtown during the !
day, but in the last two years it was i
his custom to send her for whisky. She
was unable to tell bow much her hus- ;
I band's bottle held, but she always took a '<
llask at night and boupht 50 cents' worth, j
all .of which he drank. Thin continued '
! every night for two years. He se.u her to 1
j a regular liquor-store on Valencia street
i because he said they gave more at a |
I liquor-store than at a grocery.
When Mr. O'Connor remained at borne j
; in thf day he sent her to buy whisky, 10
i cents' worth at a time. She often went
I six times, and not infrequently seven and
eight times, but she drew the line at nine
times, and then be won d beat her.
A courtroom f till ol witnesses have been I
1 subpenaed, and further testimony is to be
; taken to-day.
LOOKING FOR A FIREBUG.
A Young Man Makes Attempts to De
stroy Two Vacant Flats.
The police are' looking for a young man
who has apparently developed a mania
for setti ng fire to vacant flats. He is de
scribed as about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches tall,
slieht mustache, slender build, wears a
summer suit, and has a pleasant way of
talking.
Yesterday afternoon about 3 o'clock he
called at the drugstore on Clay and Leav
enworth streets and asked for the key of a
vacant flat at 1329 Clay street, as he
wanted to examine it. He cot the key
and leturned with it in about twenty min
iites. A few minutes later a lady who
lives in the flat below discovered that the
vacant flat was on fire. An alarm was
turned in and the flames were extin
guished before much damage was done.
The walls and ceiling in one of the rooms
had caught fire from a lot of wood and
paper that had been piled up in the closet
*nd set on rire.
Tuesday afternoon the same young man
made a similar attempt In aa-acant flat at
1227 Harrison street. He got the key from
a corner grocery. The flames were extin
guished after about $100 worth of damage
had been done.

SUDDEN DEATH
OF W. H. HAWLEY
The Weil-Known Tugboat
Superintendent Passes
Away.
A Man Universally Respected
by All Classes of People
on the Front.
Ho Served Through the War and
Will Be Buri d in the Grand
Army P.at.
It is the unexpected that always hap
pens. Monday afternoon Captain William
M. Hawley, superintendent of the Sprec
kels Towboat Company, was apparently
in perfect health and his cheery voice
could be heard half a block away as tie
laughed over a story told by one of a
group of captains who surrounded him.
They were all standing on the north side
of Market street and Captain Hawley was
waiting for a Market-street car, as he said
he wanted to get home early. He jumped
CAPTAIN WILLIAM M. HAWLEY, the Universally Respected
Superintendent of the Spreckels Towboat Company, Who
Died Suddenly Yesterday.
[From an old photograph by Taber.]
on the car without waiting for it to stop,
waved his band good by to his friends and
that was the last time they saw him alive.
Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock he died
from hemorrhage of the lungs.
About 5:30 a. m. Captain Hawley began
to complain of a tight feeling in tbe chest,
but did not pay much attention fo it. At
6:15 a. m. some ship captain rang him up
in regard to the dqekinc of a ship. Mrs.
Hawley answered the telephone and the
captain told her to say that he would at
tend to the matter when he got downtown.
Three-quarters of an hour later a fit of
coughing seized him and that was the be
ginning of the end. At 8 a. m. he was
dead.
There was no better known or better
liked man in San Franci*co than Captain
William M. Hawley. He was a splendid
business man and a favorite with all with
whom he came in contact. He was a
great friend of the newsboys, and many of
the lads who sell papers around the fer
ries will miss the whole-souled skipper. 1
He came here from New York in the early
50's and went into partnership with Ed
ward Dillon, the chronometer-maker,
under the firm name of Dillon & Co. His
knowledge of maritime matters and ac
quaintance with masters of ships helped
wonderfully, and the venture was a liuan
cia-1 success.
Hawley remained with Dillon a num
ber of years and then cast in his lot with
th<s old Griffith Tugboat Company. lie
was for a long time "Griff's" most trusted
employe and was given the settlement of
all contracts and a general supervision of
all the business done by the concern.
When the Ship-owners' and Merchant-
Towboat Company absorbed the old line
Captain Hawlty was retained on the pay
roll, and while he had nothing to do Cap
tain Griffith assured him that his pay
should ro on until he secured another
position. This shows how the services of
the man had been appreciated.
When John D. Spreckels became inter
ested in towboats Captain Ilawley was
one of the first to be offered a position.
He finally became suierintendent of the
"Black Stacks," as they have come to be
known, and the keen interest he has al
[ ways shown in the line's business has in a
1 great measure helped to place the con
cern in its present enviable position, that of
. one of the finest, equipped towboat com- j
panics in America. He was beloved by
I every man in the service, as he took a per
sonal interest in the advancement of each j
employe. He was kind-hearted to a 1
fault, and the personification of patience
and perseverance. He seldem or ever lost
his temper, and when he did no one wÂ»s
more ready than he to make amends.
Captain Hawley seemed to have a pre
monition that his end was near. He was
v member of the National Guard of New
York, and also served during the war. !
Being a member of George H. Thomas |
po^t, he was ent.tled to the privilege of j
burial in the Grand Army plat at the Pre- |
sidio. Last Sunday he want out there j
and selected his lot, and on. Monday he
showed several of his friends the receipt
for the money paid for it. At thtMinio j
he had a slight cold, and when in the |
office of ths John D. Spreckels Company
remarked, "I tot this cold through wear
ing a rubber overcoat and there it is. I'll
never wear it again." The cold wore away
daring the day, and in the evening Cap
tain Hawley was as well as ever.
Captain Hawley was a member of the
United Order of Workmen, the Knights
of Honor of East Oakland, besides being a â 
Grand Army man.

Giblin estate. Tile damage was about $300.
How the fire was started is no; known. While
it may have started from some one who was
examining the premises with a view of renting,
and threw away a cigarette or match, there is
i still a suspicion that it was of an incendiary
origin. I

DEATH IN THE SAN BLAS.
Unknown - Blaii,nunj>;eii Into.. the Hold
and l!ro:Â»ks His Neck.
An unknown man, wearing the apparel
of a laborer, plunge! to his death down
into the hold of the steamer San Bias, !ay
in<: at the Union Iron Works, last evening.
The body was discovered by P. ue Groot,
who notified the Coroner's office and
Deputy Coroner Tyrrell removed the re
mains to the Morgue.
It is not kr.ow:i just how the deceased
met with the accident. No one saw him
fall, but as th? body was directly under
the main hatch, which was open, and his
neck was broken, the theory that he met
nis death by a fall, is, in all probability,
correct.
No one employed on the shiporin the
iron works could identify the body.
A note addressed to Dave Sneehan was
found on the body, and it is believed that
this may lead to his identification.
PILLSBURY AGAIN.

WILL VISIT SCHOOLS.
The Board of Health Is Still Watching
Diphtheria to Prevent It From
Spreading Further.
The Board of Health decided yesterday
that in order to form an intelligent idea of
the danger of the spread of diphtheria it
would be necessary to make a thorough in
spection of the Everett and Notre Dame
school bnilding3 and their sanitary ar
rangements. After considerable discus
sion of the subject it was decided that the
full board, accompanied by the Health,
Officer, visit tne schools at once.
The report of Dr. Spencer, the bacteriol
ogist, was adopted as an official circular
and. ordered printed for general distribu
tion. The report gives directions for de
tecting cases of the disease and for pre
venting contagion.

Prior to the. election of : officers" Ihe fo!-.
lowing amendments to the 'constitution
were adopted:
Article 3, section?: If a branch decides not
to send any delegate to the State Council It
may elect some one ot the officers of the State i
Council or a delegate-elect of some branch j
who will be in attendance to represeut it.
â¢ Such officer, or delegate shall, in addition to
bis own vote, have a right to the vote or votes
belonging to that branch.
The following article 5, section sâ was
.stricken out:
The State president, vice-president and State
â¢ secretary shall Invite a priest to act as State
spiritual director, who, upon acceptance,
shall be the State spiritual director for the en
suing term, provided the priest requested' to
so act be a member of the order.
The third section of article 7 will hence
* forth read that the State secretary's com
pensation shall be given in two payments,
as follows:
. The last payment shall not be made until ho ]
shall have written up the minutes oi the con- j
vention in the minute-book and have turned j
â¢ over to his successor all books and papers and !
other property, In good order, to the satisfac- j
tion of the State president.
In law 4 the following amendment was
! adopted:
This State Council shall empower its officers
to levy a certain sum per cxpita to defray its
expenses. The State officers may call in the
tax in one or two payments, and every branch
shall pay the amount out of its treasury lor
each actual member at lhe date of the call as
issued by the t-taie secretary and forward it to
the State treasurer within sixty days.
This was introduced in the nature of a
recommendation, which was adopted:
That a different mode of levying assessments
be adopted by the Supreme Councilâ a mode j
by which distance irom tne supreme-, officers
would work no hardship on .branches; and by |
; which benefits would be paid within $ixty j
days. We recommend again the mode indorsed
by the California State Council and proposed j
at the last Supreme Council.
Spiritual Advisor Rev. Serda presented
his resignation from that office, statins: as j
his reason that lie. was a resident of Oak- !
land, which place, although possessing '
fewer Catholics than San. Francisco, still j
was" blessed with a great many, more !
âº Catholic Knights. .â¢; -Therefore, he DeJieved
it would be advisable to appoint or elect a I
spiritual advisor from this side of the bay. i
The . reverend prntleman recommended !
"'the election of Father Cummini;Â«. pastor j
of St. Charles Borromeo Church, at oiiot- !
well and Eighteenth streets. Subse- j
quently the Rev. Serda's resignation was ,
not accepted and he was re-elected by
acclamation. '.

THE BENSLEY ESTATE.
Judge Morrow Stops the Heirs From
Further Interference With the
Assignee of a Bankrupt Flrui.
United States District Court Judge Mor
row yesterday rendered an interesting
decree in the well-known case of Lloyd
against Julia Ball and others. Lloyd Is
the assignee of the bankrupt firm of
James Linforth, John Bensley and L. B.
Benchley, co-partners under the firm
name of Linforth, Kellogg & Co., that
failed in 1877. The original assignees were
J. C. Patrick, who died in 1887, and A. L.
Tubbs, who resigned his position in the
premises. The burden was taken up by
Mr. Lloyd. In 1889 Bensley died intes
tate, leaving a large and vaiuable estate,
which consisted principally of real estate
in several parts of the State.
Prior to his death Bensley nnd his wife,
Marion and other persons conspuea to
defraud his and the firm's creditors and
did so by transferring large amounts of
realty to fictitious persona. Mrs. JsensÂ»ey
arranged that she should have a full
power of attorney of these fictitious pur
chasers which apparently vested in her
all of the rights to handle and dispose of
the property. After Bensley's death the
widow, while on her way to this coast,
died on the train, and in her trunk were
found many letters exposing the plot ana
consniracy in its fullness.
Public Administrator J. C. Pennie took
charge of the dead woman's estate, and he
was sued by Mr. L'.oyd for the restoration
of the Bensley estate, withheld previously
from the assignee and creditors. The ac
tion was successful to the assigree. the
court decreeing that her claim to the
property was void, and Administrator
Pennie was enjoined from asserting any ;
ripht to the property involved.
/The injunction of the court is .still in
Pfil force and effect Lloyd, under the I
order oi the court appointing him as I
assignee, was directed to sell portions of i
the property of the banurupt Bensley, but
he was unable to secure a purchaser, as
Julia Ball and a dozen heirs had begun
two suits as heirs of Mrs. Bensley tore-;
cover the property of her estate. This I
property consists of over 100 lots and j
blocks in t his City and several hundred
acres oi land in and eround San Diego.
The assignee Lloyd asked for a perma- !
nent injunction against the alleged heirs |
of Mrs. Bensley, prohibiting them from
further interference with the assignee and
an order commanding them to dismiss the
actions already brought.
In his decree Judge Morrow held that
Mr. Lloyd jis assignee is owner in fee sim
ple of all the lands described; also that
the defendants be and are forever re
strained and enjoined from ever asserting
or setting up claim to any of the estate or
right or title to the land described; that
that they are forever enjoined from prose
cuting any suit or action against Mr.
Lloyd, the assignee, or agaimt any title to
the land, and further, that the actions
they have now on in the Superior courts
of San Francisco and San Diego be aban
doned within twenty days, and that tney
pay all costs in tne present action in
equity.
ENDEAVORERS PLEASED.
General Secretary Baer Says This Is an
Ideal Convention City.
John Willis Baer, general secretary of |
j the United Society of Christian En- â 
! deavor, who is in the City to consult wiih
th? '97 committee about the preliminary
arrangements for the great Christian En
deavor Convention, spent the entire morn
ing and most of the afternoon in driving !
round the City with Rolia V. Watt (the ;
j energetic chairman of the committee), Dr. â¢
i E. E. Kelly and J. S. Webstir, with the
| purpose of seeing the meeting-places
j which the committee has provided for the
sessions of the convention. Mr. Baer was 'â¢
I much pleased with . the apoearance of j
lie City, and expressed the opinion that
San Fruncisco is an convention city.
The members of the '97 committee met
Mr. Baer at 5 o'clock last evening tor a j
rinal conference before his leaving the >
City.
Mr. Baer said that he hnd been agreea- i
bly surprised during his tour 01 inspection â 
yesterday at the capacity and general I
availability of the Mechanics' and Wood- I
ward's pavilions. He gave it as his opin
ion that the two buildings could be fitted !
up at very slight cost to hold 000 or 17,
-000 people, and yet give all a good chance
to hear. With the exception of Boston |
and St. Louis, he said that no city had i
been able to furnish better hall accommo- j
dations. â¢. "â .'â â : , '.:'J' '-â¢ "â â :.."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1896.
LECTURED FOR
THE CARNIVAL
A Fine Audience Listened
to Father Yorke at the
Temple.
What the Home Is That Also Is
the City, the State and
the Nation.
A Loyal Address Interspersed With
Respects to Some Local Recol
lections.
Rev. Father P. C. Yorke'a lecture last
evening at Metropolitan Temple for the
benefit of the Carnival of the Golden Gate,
which is to be held fn San Francisco next
April, was attended by a large audience.
General W T arfield presided. On the list of
invited guests and vice-presidents were:
Archbishop P. W.Riordan, Bishop Nichola
of San Jose, Rev. Mr. Voorsanger, Rev.
Mr. Levy, Rev. Mr. Nieto, Rev. C. L. Bar
rington, Charles M. Shortridge, M. H. de
Young, A. M. Lawrence, M. Green blatt,
John D. Spreokels, Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin, Hon. William AKord. Hon. S.
M. Shortridge and Hon. W. P. Lawler,
most of whom were not able to be present.
Colonel O'Byrne sat at the right of
Chairman Wariield. The clergymen on
the platform were Revs. Fathers O'Con
nor, Crannsell, Philips, McGrath, Mulli
gan, O'Riordan, Cleary, Cummins, Egan
and J. F. Nugent.
The appearance of Father Yorke on the
platform and his introduction by the chair
man were met with enthusiastic and con
tinuous cheering and applause.
Chairman Warfield read a letter of re
gret at inability to be present from Mayor
elect James D. Phelan, who was extended
a reception and banquet by the Associa
tion of Improvement Clubs last night, and
from Bishop William D. Nichols of San
Jose, after which he introduced the
speaker. Father Yorke said in substance:
It looks like old timesâ l mean the times be
fore the war. Itgivea me much pleasure to
come here this evening to speak in behalf of
the Golden Gate carnival. It is au undertak
ing to benetit our City, and I am glad to be
able to contribute my mite to the carnival oi
the Golden West.
We are all of different races and religious
beliefs, tut we are one in this, that wo are
proud of our homo and anxious to do it good.
You may remember that the Greeks of old
looked upon the city as their state. It was
their fatherland. The examples of patriotism
were displayed in towns which we would con
aider insignificant.
We of this day look forward to the time
when the enrth shall slumber in universal
law. Still, we have not forgotten the old Greek
iden. oi fealtyâ that he who serves his city best
serves his country best aiso. Every tie that
binds tts to this earth binds us to the city and
the state and the nation. When these arc
aroused to danger from enemies without
i then they are aroused to protect their lireside
! ana their flag.
General Smith in 1849 was sent out here,
and reported to the General Government that
we had a bad climate, no harbor, and bad
water, and urged that the metropolis of Cali
fornia should be pl&Cfd. oi all sites in the
world, up in Benlcta. But in spite of General
Smith the metropolis of California grew.
The history of the human race is the history
of emigration. When we find the leaders of
! the human race we find them goiug out of
I tneir own country, and. to many instances, us
among the Jewish people, led by the Lord. We
find Europe swept by nation after nation, peo
i pie alter people, all pressing on toward tho
(westward star of empire. So In God's good
1 time they crossed the . Atlantic, and we, the
j foremost, have crossed the continent and ;
I stand fiice to face with another ocean on an- i
; other sphere.
I Science and history sbow us that the great
I Asiatic nations started in the valleys of the
I Tigris and Euphrates. We are face to face
| with them and wardens of two great conti
nents, Asia and America. It behooves us to
consider well our destiny toward our City and
our fellow-citizensâ of that City which is the
guardian of the destinies of the East and the
Wc-t.
"Righteousness exalteth a nation." We
have glorious natural resources, but I will say
little of them. Others may tell you of Cali
fornia'x great undeveloped possibilities. It is
men who make the country, not tne country
makes the men. Rich countries nave often
been peopled by races who did not know the
importance of making the most use of the
gifts which nature had sent. In this great
country we found the lowest and most de
graded tribe of Indians that could be found on
the continent. Man doth not live by bread
alone. There is something higher than ma
terialism. We muu have a people who follow
the law and love righteousness for the sake of
righteousness.
It behooves the people to see that those '
things are fostered which promote rigbt- i
eousness; to see those things in our cities
which should be bid remain hidden. It be
hooves you, ladies and gentlemen, to see that
things may be better than they are. There
are men in the community who imagine that
nothing goes rignt umesn they hove a finger
jin the pie. "Sour grapes" is an old but a true
; adage. Ido not mean to say our Government
is periect or our magistrates angel.Â°, but I say
that these reiormers are not paining anything
by denouncing everything that belongs to the
common wen itn.
It is necessary to have an educated commu
nity, and the public should see to ii that the
I education in the public and parochial xchools
: ll the best kind oi education. Not all who are
: of my people believe in free trade in educa
i tion. It you allow a public-school system to
swallow up the schools you will have a system
as stagnant as the Chinese empire. Every
! mm's mind should be left tree to teach in
] whatever way he thinks will improve teaching.
Home is the foundation of the Rtate. Home, I
! the cradle of good citizenship, should becul-l
tivated. We have been charged with being a !
Nation without homes, but they who muke '
the charge know nothing of the home life :
here. They torgot the d->ep strong current ;
undcrneatn that is not visible on the surface.
Thank God w<Â» ure coming to that condition
when every man may own his own home, and
the tendency ot the Nation is toward the home.
Every man who attempts to nhifi ths burden
of the taxation ou the home is an enemy of
this City.
It is the duty of public men to see that the
burdens of taxation on the home are light
ened. It is an outrage and a shame to our
civilization to find on our statutes a law by â¢
which the pawnbroker can enter the home i
and leave the house bare and as though it
were tenantless.
If we are to have a great city we must have
public spirit. If we are to have San Francisco
as the poet says of her, "the center of civiliza
tion and the warden of two continents," then
we must have public spirit and citizens who
can make sacrifices.
We should be united. We should be one. i
We have, unfortunately, in the past been *1 i- j
vided in lines that should never have been j
brought up; on lines that sought to array
. father against son. Thank God, we have got
over thM. The cloud has rolled by. The sun
shine of liberty comes in. Now is the time tor
men of every class and creed to be up and
doing for the common good.
In this City there should be no lack of enter
prise. I think wjie;i we look back upon the
history and the beginnings of California we
can say they were giants in those days. They
might not have been of fine manner and dic
tion, but Letter than manners and diction is
manhood. We admire them for their pluck
and endeavor. We can find example there.
We find also that there came with them men
and women who sought no goid but the gold
of souls. They were iar in excess of the few
whose crimes were told to the eartn as speci
mens of California life. y
If the children of California are not the '
equals of their fatners and mothers It Is the !
fault of ineir fathers and mothers. 8o far as
the native son has shown his mettle, he has
not proved an unworthy scion of a wortny !
sire. Our mountain peaks will be monitors of
a new people who will have ideas and who
will work them out better than any other peo
ple tha*. ever lived.
I believe the good name |of a man's home
should be very dear to him, and the good
name of his city just an dear. I do not thlm
It is loyal when we find people slandering the
city and the SUte in which they live, and any
man who does it is an enemy of the common
weal. In the last few days we have b.Md this
matter brought home to us very iorcibly In
the land of the webfoot, where it rains eight
days in the week, there is a paper called the
Oregonian, known for its bitterness and its
bigotry, and it slandered California.
A local paper took the matter up where the
Oregonian left off. which is a beautiful ex
ample in these latter dÂ«ys of Satan rebuking
sin. It got opinions to refute the Oregoniuc
f.U the way down from Governor Budd to Dr.
Dille. The Oregonian reflected on California
honor and California women. From this same
platform were uttered similar things home
months ago and this same paper and other
papers published them and there was not a
word of rebuke from our papers.
This particular paper went out to the world
saving on one page that the Oregonian had
calumniated the State, and on its other that
we arc a commuuity of "dets, divts and
drunkards," which was iiid in a sermon by
Rev. \V. W. Case.
It is very easy to give a city and a State a
bad name, and it is very bard to live it down.
We should be jyalous of the fair name oi our
city. When a man sullies tne fair name of our
city, be he priest or parsou, he should be
made to show it or shut up. We must make
these people beck up their statements, or
there snould be such an expression of public
indignation as shall mate them keep silence
because they cannot keep decency.
But best of all is to have outside people come
and see us. See our flowers and sunshine and
climate. That is what the carnival will bring.
We believe this State can sustain twenty
times its present population. What we want
is for the people to come and see this State,
and not be deceived by lying pulpits and
pamphleteers.
We believe that this City can become what
the poet said of her, ''the warder of two conti
nents." We believe that future generations
will find that we in San Francisco have been
true to our ideals, true to her trust as the
warder of two continents, and that she Is the
mistress of the sea which stretches beforerier.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES.
Four Melodramas Are All Drawing
Wellâ Light Opera aud Vaudeville
Complete tha Attractions.
Melodrama is having things pretty much
its own way at the theateis this week.
The Baldwin, the Tivoli and the Orpheum
are tbe only houses not given up to that
particular form of diversion.
"Fleur de Lis" at the Baldwin is giving
more satisfaction than did its twin sis
ter, "The Littie Trooper." The music,
which reminds one-of Offenbach consider
ably diluted, is catchy, and the plot is
more ingenious than that of the operetta
in which Miss Delia Fox siiowed herself
last week. Some of the dialogue would
bear cutting, for it is nearly half-fast 11
beiore the curtain falls on the last act.
Next week Nat Goodwin and his company
will present a new play, "The American
Citizen," at the Baldwin.
The stirring melodrama, "Humanity,"
in which Joseph Grismer and Phoebe
Davies are featured, is drawing satisfac
torily at the Columbia. No doubt the
production would have arouned more no
tice ii thero had not been such a plethora
of melodramas this week.
"A Ring of Iron" is holding its own at
the Grand. The play is by no means new
here, but Manager Morosco has an excep
tionally good company just at present,
which is able to make the most of Frank
Harvey's work. Miss Williams and Ed
ward J. Heron look well after the comedy
part of the performance.
"Darkest Russia" has four more nights
and a Saturday matinee at the California
Theater. On Monday Loie Fuller will
open her engagement. She will also ap
pear on Tuesday and Wednesday and at a
Wednesday matinee.
The Alcazar is giving its audiences more
than their moneys worth of excitement
in the melodrama, "At Fort Bliss." One
of tbe most startling scenes is a duel in
which the wiefced colonel takes first the
hero and then the heroine, "One down,
the next come on." The play is very
satisfactorily acted by the stock company
and the scenic effects are all good.
An exceptionally good performance of
"Donna Juanita" is being given at the
Tivoli. Elvira Ircx Seabrooke makes a
dashing cadet and L:ily Post sings and
tcts well as Petrita. A feature of the pro
duction is the well-sung choruses, and the
children's chorus in the last act Is a pretty
piece of work.
A. H. Knoll and Marie McNeil, the
cornet duetisis and soloists, are the fea
tures of the Orpheum's bill this week.
The sketch done by Lewis and Elliott has
caught on lairiy well, and Burt Shepherd
has added a number of new gags to his
monologue since he opened at the begin
ning of the week.
Mrs. Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler will give
her fifth recital this evening in Metro
politan Temple.
SOLOMAN WAS ABSENT.
The Inveatiga'lon of Inspector!) Dock
â¢â¢ry and Davis by the Board of
Health Postponed.
Tbe investigaton of the charges against
Chief Food Inspector Dockery and Market
Inspector Davis by the Board of Health
did not go on yesterday, as was expected,
because of the absence of the chief witness
for the prosecution, S. Soloman, who
claims to have been the go-between in the
transaction on which the accusations are
based.
Soloman has stated that in order to trap
Dockery and Davis, whom he claims had
been soliciting bribes from dairymen, he
offered them $600 to protect Messrs. Zim
merman & Ruhland.
M. M. Estee appeared for the prosecu
tion and stated that as tbe man he repre
sented was not present and he had not
been able to see him he would ask that
the matter be postponed for a week.
Dr. Morse was in favor of having the
matter taken up at once, and of having
the charges dismissed if the witnesses,
after having had due notice, did not ap
pear.
Half a dozen attorneys who were pres
ent to represent every one concerned, in
cluding ihe Milkmen's Association, ob
jected lo such a measure, and Mr. Roth
cbild, who appeared for Soloman, assured
the board that his client would be on hand
ii'a continuance was granted. On this
understanding the matter was put over
for a weeK. _
Socialists Want Representation.
At the regular meeting of the City Central
Committee of the Socialist Labor party on
Tuesday evening a committee of threeâ Oliver
Everett. G. B. Benham and E. T. Kingsleyâ was
appointed to request of Mayor-elect Phelan au
equitable representation for the Socialists on
the committee of 100 which the Mayor-elect is
to appoint to take in charge the matter of a
new charter for San Frauciato.

MISS BUCKLEY'S
INGENUE ORBIT
Its Brilliancy Not Dimmed
by Any Other
Star.
Frank Doane ani Amy Lee
Withdraw From the
Alcazar Theater.
His Interest Has Recently Bsen Pur
chased by the Remaining
Three Partners.
When Frank Doane became one of the
co-partnership in the management of the
Alcazar Theater upon its reopening some
months ago, he saw in it, in addition to
the stock of hard money on the profit side
of the box-office, an opportunity for his
wife, the charming actress, Amy Lee, to
display ber versatility.
Miss Lee several years ago appeared in
Miss Amy Lee.
ingenue, parts with great success, but
when she desired to undertake them at
the Alcazar the associates of Mr. Doane
demurred. Miss Lee is a clever actress,
they said, but time brinsrs changes in other
qualifications for a spirited ana supple
part.
The co-partners said nothing derogatory
to Miss Lee's talent, but if the truth must
be told it was her avoirdupois on which
the objection hune. They contended that
Miss Lee was not supple enough â for in
stance, to take the part of Kate in ''The
Ugly Duckling"â but Miss Lee and Mr.
Doane contended that she could act as
girly as lUi^s May Buckley or any other
fair actress of more or less avoirdupois.
The contention resulted in Miss Buck
ley appearing as the Ugly Duckling,
which she did with much success, and in
Miss Amy Lee not appearing at all.
Hence relations in that part of a theater
which the public sees not longer than is
Miss May Buckley.
required to plank down the price and
rush for the auditorium became a trifle
strained.
There was a continuous disagreement
between the manauemeit as to wiiat
pnrts in the drama Miss Lee should por
tray to a delighted audience and what she
might not be ntted to essay.
The relations lately have been rather
strained, and it is saia that Miss Lee
would not make up on the snme side of
the house or appear in the same act with
Miss Buckley.
This week things were terminated. Mr.
Doane and Miss L?e are no longer inter
ested in the Alcazar. His interest was
purchased by the o'her partners. Messrs.
J. B. Jordan, Fred Belasco an<i Harry La
Faille, and Miss May Buckley, who car
ried off the honors in "The ugly Duck
ling," and since then in other ingenue
parts, is now the leading lady of the Alca
zar in ingenue parts. Her brilliancy is
not dimmed nor threatened by any oth r
star in the orbit.

RECEIPTS OF "WINE AND BRANDY.
Receipts of Wine and Brandy at this port In the
first ten months of the year were as follows, com
pared with the same time in 1895: Wine. 12,066.448
gallons. aeuinst 12,279,500; Brandy, 135,225 gal
lons, against 123,665.
Explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. Tne top fignroi
at station indicate maximum temperature for the I
days; those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in Inches and hundredths. i
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid 1
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; Iso- I
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hleh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and â¢ rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
roast. When the pressure is high In th* interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain Is probable;
but when the "low" Is Inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" In Ihe vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather may be expected in slimmer and colder
- weather in winter. The reverse of these condition!
trill produce an opposite, result.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 18.â From an open\ng
tone of steadiness at a decline of from % to % of
a cent from yesterdar's close, wheat developed
strength, recovering the loss mentioned and add
ing another cent to prices during the first hour's
trading to-day. Reports of sales of wheat at the
Atlantic seaboard for shipment to Australia
helped the riung tendency. Liverpool opened
weak and I%'J lower to-day, responsive to which
was the early decline here. Receipts in the North
west were 806 cars against 441 last Wednesday
and 936 on the corresponding .lay a year ago.
Chicago received 63 cars and inspec.ed out 239,
-401 bushels.
Reports received from Argentine spoke favora
bly of the crop. Late Liverpool cables were firmer,
although sti'l quoting a decline of %d. Closing
Paris cables were higher and Antwerp unchanged.
Berlin had a holiday. Export clearances nmo.ine.l
to :os. 80 bushels, i December wheat opened
from 76c 10 763/sc, advanced to 78 1 /2@" > ' 585 8 clos
ing at 78% c, lVs(i*l s /ic higher than yesterday.
Estimated receipts for io-mo:r.w. 323 cars. No.
2 spot wheat ranged from 83c to 86Vs : \ closing at
about 85% cto 86% c.
CORNâ The opening decline in wheat carried
weakness to corn, but the rally in the lornier did
not fully repair the damage previously done the
latter. Trading was of the ordinary, uninteresting
sort. Kven the scalpers were doing little. Liver
pool cables were %d lower. Receipts were 256
cars and 440,096 bushels were taken from store-
Exports were rood at 071,610 bushels. May corn
opened at 27% c, sold between 273 @27%c and
27%@27%c. ciosias at 27^c, %c under yester
day. Estimated receipts lor to-morrow &00 cars.
OATSâ The market leaned to corn ra. her than
to wheat, prices falling to rally from the weak
spot which appeared at the > opening. Receipts
were 146. cars, and 33,148 bushels were taken
from store. Exports were 8370 bushels. May
oats closed yg@V4c under yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-jiorrow 215 cars.
FLAXâ Was Irregular. Cash. 77c: December.

PROVISIONSâ The grain market, especially
wheat, governed prov.slons to the disregard of the

sequent tone firm. Toward the close on moderate
selling recessions too.* place. January pork
closed 7%c lower, January lard and ribs each 2%

COFFEEâ C. E. Blckford's circular says: "The
movement during the past week has been slow,
due partly to the character of the country demand
but largely to the competition of Santos Coffees.
These interfere materially with all grades of Cen
tral American eaual 10 or poorer than unwashed
Salvador in quality, owing to their relative cheap
ness and tho further fact that tho remaining first
hand sto.'k Is mainly composed of undesirable
styles or Coffees lacking roasting merit, more par
ticularly appllcab c to Ouatemalas. serviceable
grades of Costa Rica have become very scarce here
and the necessities of dealers drew shipments of
several hundred bats from New York. To-day's
stock consists of 272 Costa Rica, 103 Nicaragua,

Widow Lemon Refuses to
Disturb Her Husband's
Drugstore.
For Ten Years It Has Stood as
When Death Called Him
Away.
Blindness Will Scon Prevent the Faith
lul Sou From Seeing the
Well-Known Place.
Oakland Office San Fbahcmoo Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 19. )
An attempt recently made to lease a
Btore on Broadway, near Third street,
brought to light an interesting case oi a
woman's devotion to the memory of her
husband.
Mrs. liemon lives at the back of the
store, which is located one door north of
Third street, on the east side of Broad- i
way. For over ten years she has lived !
there, but not a thing in the store has
been touched since the night her husband
died suddenly of pneumonia.
Dr. Lemon was the preorietor of the
drugstore, which was established over
thirty years ago when lower Broadway
was the busiest part of the city. His
place was known all over the county, and
he was equally popular as a drugstore
proprietor and as a physician. About ten
years ago he died, ana the widow decided
that she would leave the store just as it
was when her husband la-t left it, and
she has refused to alter her decision.
Many years ago the windows became so
entirely frosted with dust and cobweb*
that no one has been able to look icicle
from the street. A rough wooden batten i
is nailed across the window, and for over i
five years the thousands of people who i
have passed have not known that it was j
an empty store, like many others in that
part oi town.
The interior is interesting. It is a com
plete drugstore. The walls are covered
with shelves, on which are labeled bottl* s
partially filled witn drugs. Mildew has <
done its work, but a large portion of the |
bottles and viais are no worse disfigured j
than with half an inch of dust and cob- j
webs. The varnish on the shelves and j
fixtures has disappeared, and the wrap- j
ping-paper, once white, has long since
turned yellow. The scales contain seme
drug that was in process of heing weighed I
when the proprietor hurriedly went to his :
room, from which he was carried out a few j
dajs later. The prescription-book is f
open, but is covered bo deep with dust
that the writing is not legible. A bottle
with the stopper out is be-ide it, and the j
prescription which Dr. Lemon was filling
ten years ago is beside it.
Lartre piece* oi paper hang from the
dank walls and festoons oi spiders' tracks
connect one side of the store with the
other. The key in the lock has rusted
and the aged widow uses a rear entrance.
In the window are old almanacs ai.d par
. eels oi herbs that have long s nee lost j
their virtue. The lamp is aiso there thai â 
burned out the night the proprietor lit it
for the last time.
For a wonder, uo one has ever reported I
a ghost in the deserted store. Such a j
luxury, however, is unnecessary, as the I
place is a ghost in itself.
Mrs. Lemon is now an old v>oman, but i
when a proposition was made lately to
lease the store she refused to listen to it,
and declared that it sbould remain as it
is. It is reported that in her will she has
desired that the property siiall not fee dis
turbed for all time. If this t>e the ca^e,
her desire cannot be carried ont. as the
house will not be habitable for many
more years.
During the past few months blindness
has overtaken the widow, and now she
can only see with difficulty. Every day
stie coes into the store and looks at the
place once occupied by her husband. Be
fore long she will go in there, but will see
nothing. Although her income from her
property is very small, and barely enough
for her wants, ohe will not add to it by
renting the drugstore.

MORE RAIDS IN BERKELEY.
Arrests of Men Charged With Traffick
ing iv Intoxicants Within the
"Mile Limit."
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 18.â Marshal
Lloyd began anotner raid upon the illicit
liquor-shops of East Berkeley to-day, sim
ilar to the famous round-up of about a
year ago. Three places were visited at
which, according to general rumor, liquor
has been on sale for some time.
Joseph Doran, keeper of the new Ache
son hotel, was arres'ed and charged with
keeping intoxicating liquors on his prem
ises. J. Woodall, who is in the employ of
Doran, was charged wirh selling liquor
without a license.
The same change was made against O.
I J. Funder. keeper of the California Hotel.
S. J. ba^mon waÂ« also arrested and
charged with conducting a gamblir.g
place. It is declared that cash poker
i games have beÂ°n running regularly in
I Salmon:* establishment.
Lloyd's new raid is one more effort upon
the part uf the town authorities to grapple
wit!i the extraordinary difficulties of regu
lating the liquor craffic, caused by the cx
i Istence of tae State University "mile
i limit" law.
The arrests of to-day were under a local
I ordinance, which contains among its pro
visions a clause making it a misdemeanor
to sture liquor without a licence. The
'. charges against Funder and Wood all,
however, of selling without, a license, im
i piy a violation of the "mile-limit" law, as
! well as of the town ordinance. If the one
| can bo established in court, so can the
j other.
Marshal Lloyd declares that he has con
j clu-sive evidence against all the men ar
rested.

MARRIED A MAN
WITH WIFE

Wedded Life Ended

Searched Her Husband's Trunk
and Found a Letter He

He Is Now Under Arrest at Los

Life in a CelL
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
908 Broadway, Nov. 18. J
John lice, who is now under arrest at
Los Angeles, has an Oakland recoid. He
lived several years in tuis city, where he
has a wife and child livmz at Third and
Grove streets. Lee, or Bisbee, baa been
married several times and it is hinted by
friends of his Oakland wile that he has
committed bigamy.
About two and a half years ."go Lee, as
he called himself here, was a hackman
employed at the late Peter Pumyea's
stables. In June, 1894, ne met Miss
Minnie Dccl, who was one of the most
attractive young girls in this city. Lee
Miss Minnie Dccl, a Seventeen-
Year-Old Bride, Who Fears Her
Husband Committed Bigamy.
was a very smooth talker and he won the
eirl's heart. He was quite sporty in ap
pearance and was one of the best known
men of his class around town. On June
20, 1894, he married Mi-s Dccl, who was
then only 17, and the couple lived pleas
antly for more than a year. About a year
ago a little boy was born and soon after its
birth Lee began to show sign* of uneasi
ness ana expressed a desire to leave
Oakland.
Some months ago the couple went to
Los Angeles, but their hauj mess soon
ended. According to the story told by
the young wife's relatives, Mrs. Lee over
hauled her husband's trun* one day and
then there was a *cene. She found a letter
from a woman who stated that unless he
produced papers showing that he had
been divorced from bis former wife all
corre-^poi.dcnce should cease.
This opened the wife's eyes and she de
manded several kinds of an explanation.
.Lee did not give her the satisfaction that
she sought, so she came back with her
child to Oakland, and has sine* res ded
with her mother.
After ieturning to this city Mrs. Lee
started an investigation and discovered
that under the name of Bisbee her hus
band had married a woman in San Fran
cisco, but Â»he could find no record of a
divorce. She al.-o found that at that par
ticular time her husband was anxious to
leave Oakland his San Francisco wife was
mating inquiry regarding him. His
young Oakland wife then made a demand
on him for his divorce papers, but he
would not produce them, *o she secured
the services of ex-Judge Gibson, and Lee
was recently served with the papers in Los
Ange ss.
Lee was arrested Monday night at Los
Angeies for an assault upon little Flossie
Fey, the 13-year-old daughter cf one of
t tie best-known merchant* of that city.
After his arrest he tried to commit suicide.

THE WRECK OF THE ARAGO.
Captain A. Herd Kxoneratnd From All
I'.lnin. by the Inspectors.
O. F. Bolles and W. A. Phillips of the
steam vessel inspection service have pre
sented their official report to Captain
John Berminghara of their investigation
of the case of the loss of the steel steamer
Araco on the Coos Bay jetty, Oregon. The
local inspectors exonerate Captain A.
Heed, the master of the Arago, from all
blame for the loss of the vessel, aud they
pay him a hijrh compliment for his efforts
in saving life and property. The disaster
occurred on Octolx>r 2<J.
After reviewing ttie evidence, the in
spectors in their reportÃ say:
From the evidence taken in this case we find
that the chunnel at that point was only about
50t> teet wine aud the master was justified in
KoinÃ near the ond of the jetty, as it is cus
tomary for steamers to go there to look at the
bar. Athlsiimu Curtain Reed met with a
BtronE northerly current settinK ncross the
end of the J"lty, which was exactly opposite to
what he and others had experienced before at
the same stHÂ«e of thf tide. This is corrob
orated by Captain A. M. Simpson, a man of
many years' experience on Coos Bay bar, and
by the United States Life-saving crew. Tne
unexpected current with the heavy sea caused
the loss of the steamer Araro.
Alter she struck < aptain R.ed did all in his
power to save tne lives of his pass-ngcrs and
crew. We therefore exonerate him frcm
blame in connection with the above casually.
The Arago was htiilt in 1885, of steel, at
San Francisco, 947.17 tons gross, and Â«as
valued at about $100,000 ana her cargo at
$3000.

W. Paulsell, w o has been granted a
new trial by the Supreme Court, wishes to
secure a reduction of bail, to the end that
he may be at liberty pending the new
trial. His bai! was placed at $60,000. and
this be is unable to raise; consequently
he is still in the County Jail, where he
has been under a fifteen years' sentence
for robbery for some time. The crime df
which he was convicted created a sensa
tion at the time it was committed. A
gambling game on Market street was
roobed, a sack of money being taken.
Paulsell was running when he was ar
rested, as be went plump up against a
policeman.
Most of the coin was recovered, but
the boys were pickine up money on the
street the next day. The Supreme Court
granted Paulsell a new trial on the first
day of the present month. On TueÂ«duy
of the present week a writ of habeas
corpus was issued for Paulsell by the Su

SUSIE MARTIN
IS NOT YET FREE
Judge Wallace Ones More
Refuses to Dis
charge Her.
Venire Issued for a Jury to
Pass on Her Mental
Condition.
If Found to Be Insane She Will Be
Committed to the State Asylum
by the Sheriff
\esterday morning, when Judge Wal
lace called the case of Mrs. Susie Â±5. Mai
tin, who killed her husband and was ac
quitted on the ground of insanity, he
turned to Attorney Cook and asked him
if he was ready to proceed.
Mr. Cook replied that he was ready pro
vided there was anything to proceed on.
He understood the court to intimite that
proceedings would be had under section
1167 of the Penal Code, which provides
that persons acquitted of a charge of mur
der because of insanity may be examined
by a jury to determine their mental con
dition. His first contention was that a
jury ought to be impaneled from the jury
list of the county. He aiso referred the
court to section 4480 of the Political Code,
which requires that all the codes must be
construei and read together, according to
wh eh he thought proceedings in the pres
ent instance must be had under section
2210 of the Political Code, which says that
before a person may be tried on a charge
of insanity a com main t must be filed.
He thought no issue cou d be joined
without the filing of a complaint.
Continuing his remarks Mr. Cook said
that the record of the murder case would
show that no claim had been set up that
the defendant was insane at the time oi
the trial.
"If such a suggestion had been made a
opecial proceeding would have been or
dered to inquire into that matter," said
the Judge.
Reference was made by Mr. Cooit to the
case of Jane Snattuck, who was acquitted
because of insanity, and to the Fredericks
case. Mr. Cook concluded by moving that
the prisoner be discharged Irom custody
for the reason that no complaint was on
file.
His Honor said that in .hisjopinion the
record of the trial and the verdict in this
case stands in the place of a compliant.
Section 1167 of the Penal Code provides
that if a jury shall render a verdict ol
acquittal because of insanity, then the
prisoner may be examined, etc. That
had happened, and this proceeding is con
sequently in conformity with that section.
The verdict of the jury did not say it was
temporary insanity. It said the deiendani
was acquitted because of her insanity.
Remembering this it was proper to recalJ
the fact that t c testimony showed thai
the prisoner's mother was and is insane,
that her untie was insane, and that o; hers
who were related to her were insane,
That was the condition of her blood.
"The jury might have returned a ver
dict of temporary insanity if they had beet'
*o minded," said Judge Wallace, "and i:
they had done so I would not think it my
duty to take this proceeding. But here is
a venlict of acquittal, because of insanity.
The act would be felonious if committ d
by a sane person. This acquittal on the
face of it is a warrant that this woman
ma" go and kill Rnotber person and be
acquitted again because of insanity, unless
some proceeding may be hud to determine
what shall bÂ« done with her."
Judge Wallace thereupon denied Mr.
Cook's moiion to dismiss the prisoner.
He said hat the point to have a jury
drawn from the list of county jurors was
well taken, and proceeded at once to that
business.
The venire is returnable to-morrow
morninc at 10 o'clock, at which time the
examination of Mrs. Martin will be pro
ceeded with.
THE SUIT DIDN'T FIT.
Why Henry Groenninger Spoilt an Un
comfortable Hour in Justice Ker
rigan's Court Yesterday.
Henry Groenninirer spent an uncomfort
able hour in Justice Kerrigan's court
yesterday while being pulled and hauled
about by a trio of expert tailors, and all
because the fit of a suit of clothes did not
pleuse him.
Groenninger ordered the suit from John
Lemons and agreed to pay $30 for it, put
ting down $$ as a deposit. When the out
tit came home he refused to accept It, on
the ground that it >itd not fit. Lemons
sued him ior the $25 balance.
When the case came up yesterday
Lemons contended that the best evidence
of the fitness or unfitness of the suit wouid
be shown when it adorned the person of
the defendant, and Justice Kerrigan
ordered Groenninger to put on the
clothes.
Some trouble was encountered in find
ing a dressing-room, but the change was
finally accomplished in the rear room of
the justice clerk's office, and Groenninger
way escorted back to the courtroom clad
in the finery he had refused to accept.
To dress in such a place was bad, but
the ordeal that followed was worse. One
expert when called on to t^st'fy grabbed
him by the slack of the back and nearly
jerked hm oft his feet while explaining
the mysteries of fitting coats, and ano.her
bumped him under th- chin while adjust
ing the lapels of the coat.
' Siy,'* remonstrated Groenninger, "I'm
tired of being a dummy to try bad-fitting
clothes on and I want to get out of this."
The court made no order releasing i he
defendant and he stood about for an hour
while other testimony was being heard,
afraid to sit down for fear of "bagging"
the knees of the lower garment, that be
longed not to him, and thoroughly un
comfortable.
Justice Kerrigan, bein ; well versed in
the art of dressing neatly as well as in
the law, gave a verdict for the de:endant
and ordered Lemons to return the $5 paid
as a deposit.

A BULLET FOR
GAME BELLE BOYD
Broke a Leg While Racing
and Had to Be
Killed.
The Win of Moylaa Proved an
Expensive One for Owner
Corrigan.
Old Strathmeath B^at Samper L?x Out
a Head in the Hand. capâSalis
bury II Again in Front.
Tne racing days of pelle Boyd, the
game and fast chestnut daughter of El
Rio Key, are over. Her career ended at
the head of the homestretch during the
running of the lnst race on the card at
Oakland yesterday. She was one of six
starters in a mile dash, and was well up
in the bunch a? the lenders swung around
the iwnd to the wire, when the mare was
suddenly observed to fall back as if struck
by a bullet, and later her jockey was seen
to pull up and dismount. An examina
tion showed the nigh foreleg to be broKen
at the ankle, and a buliet ended her
misery. The loss of the mare is a heavy
blow to .Atkins Â«fc Lottridge, as she was
one of ihe principal bread-winners of their
strinp. This paper in yesterday's issue
stated that the Oakland track was dan
gerous from the fact that the top dressing
abounded with small stones, and it is gen
erally surmised among horsemen that to
one of these rocky particles was due the
accident.
The track was about as springy yester
day as a piece oflead pipe, and no records
wore fractured, although four favorites
did win. The fields were of fair caliber,
still there was very little enthusiasm
manifest in the ring, and the betting was
light, .is it has been all along at Oakland.
The only incident out of the usual order
of things was the bidding ap of Ed Corri
gan's Moylan, who, as one of the starters
in the third race, a six-iurlong dash, was
entered to be sold lor $400. Starting at
even money, the bay colt won with ridicu
lous ease from Major Cook. When put up
to bo sold, Tom Boyle, trainer of the latter
horse, made one bid of $1500 on the win
ner. He was retained by the stable with
the usual $5 bid.
After cavorting around in many fantas
tic styles at the post Celeste, tne 8 to 5
show lor the opening live and a half fur
long scramble, finally concluded to rnn
and made her lield look like a bunch of
scarecrows. She went through the bunrh
like a "j-aller" doe through a sausage
cutter and won galloping from the second
choice Tempestuous.
With 7 to 5 about her at the closo Can- i
dor added the purse offered for the six- !
furlong spin that followed to Owner ;
Frank Phillips' account. Getting away |
seventh T. Murphy Gradually wended his
way to the front and passed the wire with
nothing to spare, three parts of a length
before Mt. Roy. Edgeniont was a good
third.
The old cmnaigner Strath meath, look
ing like a twu-year-old, with the excep
tion of his banciaged legs, which show the
<ffectsof many hard races, captured the
mile and a sixteenth handicap in a drive
from Semper L>x, each currying 100
pounds. Strntlmieath wa< a 6 to 5 favor
itÂ«Â», while McXaughton & Muir's horse
had threes about him in the ring and at
one time 5 to 1. The 50 to 1 outsider,
Thornhill, showed the way until well
straightened for borne, where lack of con
dition told and he dropped back. Well
into the stretch Peter the Second looked a
winner, but was passed by both Strath
meath and SÂ°mper Lex, the former get- !
ting the verdict by a head after a very
bard drive. Tenacity, poorly ridden by
little Thompson, was a close third. Time,
I:49}*.
Uue to two was always obtainable about
Red Glen, and verjr weakly ridden by H.
Martin he tin is bed half a" length behind
Salisbury 11, who was allowed to make a
runaway race of it. The time, l:4'2'i', was
good. Fred Gardner, a 200 to 1 shot, rin
ished in the show.
Notes.
"Billy" Nixon, a well-known layer of
odds, is here from New York, and will
shortly be seen on the block.
The performance of Paiomacita in the
third race yesterday was such an improve
ment over her run on Monday that the
judges asked Trainer Timmons and Owner
Waterhouse for an explanation. It might
be well for tne officials to also inquire
what became of Midlo'a speed on Tuesday.

j for Palomacita there is an excuse, as it is
claimed she was cut off in Monday's race.
Benamela was a heavily backed second
choice for the third event and made an
awful showing, finishing a block behind
his field. After the race it was discovered
! tiie poor animal was sick and a veterinary
surgeon had to be called into requisition.
Willie Martin apparently saw the horse
was not fit to rut., for he made no effort
with him from the head of the stretch.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1896.
WATCHING CITY
HALL JANITORS
The Grand Jury Summons
Them to Tell of Their
Work.
A Preposition on Foot to Do the
Work on the Contract
System.
Women's Elucaticnal Union Figuring
on the Jobâ Mr. Murdock Is
Under Fire.
Head Janitor Murdockof the City Hall
aud his twenty-eight subordinates were
up before the Grand Jury last evening to
tell how the big municipal building is
cleaned and how they earn their salaries,
which range from the $150 per month,
the compensation drawn by Mr. Murdock,
to $50, the amount paid the lowest subor
dinate.
From the trend of the questions asked
it is evident that the jury thinks that the
$25,000 which it costs the City to cleanse
the hall is too muchnioney.
This idea is given color by the fact that
some of the jurymen have been making
inquiries regarding the manner in which
a number of big office buildings are
cleaned and the cost of the operation.
They found, it is said, that the Mills
building, the largest in the City, is cleaned
by contract for $5000 a year, and, more
over, well cleaned.
Mr. Murdook, who is a brother-in-law of
Supervisor King, was the first witness
called and he was subjected to a searching
examination as to the number of men re
quired to do the work and the hours they
labor. His own hours were c'osely in
quired into and the matter of supplies
was gone into at length. Mr. Murdock
looked far from comfortable when he
emerged from the jury-room and refused
to tell any thine regarding the questions
asked.
Then the under janitors were called in
one by one and also closely examined.
They were asked how many hours they
were on duty, whether they had worked
the full month, as called for by their sal
ary demands, and whether they would
be able to care for more rooms than those
now under their charge. Then some
searching questions were put by Assistant
District Attorney Peixotto, who con
ducted the examinations, regarding .Mr.
Murdock's attention to the duties of his
office, whether he was on duty at all times
of the day and whether he personally super
intended the washing down of the corridors
and saw that the offices were thoroughly
cleaned.
A majority of the janitors testified that
Mr. Murdock spends nt least the larger
portion of hUTime seeing that the men
are at work; that he olten orders work
done with more care when it does not
please him.
The jury also examined the Auditor's
Recounts, to see how much was paid for
janitors' wages during the past two or
three months. â¢
It is expected that the jury will recom
mend thai the Board ot Supervisor* ad
vertise for bids for cleansing the hall and
let yearly contracts to the lowest bidders.
The Women's Educational Union has
already heard that there is a chsince of the
hall being kept in sinitary condition by
contract nnd is figuring on the job.
Two elegantly dressed representatives
of the organization called at the And: tor's
office yesterday and obtained data on the
cost of labor and supplies under the
present system. They said that the town
was full of poor but deserving women who
could do the work as well as men and
much more cheaply, and that if opportu
nity offered they would endeavor to get
the contract.

CONSUMPTION CLAIMED TO BE
ERADICABLE FROM THE RACE
This Is the Startling Assertion Made With the
Utmost Confidence hy Dr. Joseph
Hirschfelder.
In a Few Generations He Says
the Disease Can Be Wiped
Out.
HIS METHOD OF OPEEATION.
The Government Should Establish
Institutions for Free Examina
tion and Treatment.
Dr. Joseph 0. Hirschfelder, who re
cent'y discovered a new method of treat
ing consumption and in last August pub
lished for the benefit of the medical pro
fession the results of his experiments to
gether with a full description of his treat
ment, made the assertion yesterday that
in a very few generations tuberculosis
could be exterminated.
The doctor went further. He declared
that he was absolutely convinced of the
correctness of his theory. Upon this con
viction he based his statement that con
sumption can be completely wiped out.
Dr. Hirschfelder's method has been put
to the test and found effectual in checking
the disease in incipient stages rather than
In killing the ecrms outright, thereby
effecting a thorough and permanent cure.
So much ia claimed for the method by the
doctor after a iong and careful applica
tion. Since the dreadful disease can thus
be cured if taken in time the inference is
that by prompt and intelligent action on
the part of physicians and people the
ravages of consumption can be checked.
The next siep in this steady progress
would be the detection and cure of con
sumption immediately it shows itself, and
then in time its complete eradication.
This interesting method is no longer a
secret. It was made public in August and
is now in the hands of the physicians, for
them to do with it as they deem lit. In
the East it has attracted considerable at
tention, and indeed is already adopted by
many physicians. Regarding the treat
ment itself or any subsequent experi
ments Dr. Hirschft*lder would not speak,
as he beiieves that the profession is first
entitled to whatever he may write. How
ever, he has settled convictions about its
application, which he discussed yesterday
with considerable enthusiasm. He wouU
like to see the Government take up tne
matter and introduce measures whereby
tests or examinations would be made of
all people afflicted with coughs or sus
pected with having consumption, tne end
in view being to eradicate the disease. So
the question ha 3 resolved itself almost
into one of social science for the physical
betterment of the race.
"Through the investigations of Koch
and his demonstration of the presence of
bacillus "of tuberculosis in all cases of that
disease," said the doctor, "it becomes an
easy matter to detect the disease in its
early fcta^es.
â¢'lnstitutions should be organized by
the Government for the free examination
of the sputum of every individual affected
with cough or suspected to be tubercular
in any direction. Individuals who would
be found to be afflicted with tuberculosis
in tit is manner could then be supplied by
the Government gratis with this remedy,
and in this way in a very few generations
tuberculosis would be exterminated.
"I am absolutely convinced of the cor
rectness of this theory that the anti
toxines are simply oxidized toxines; and
the experiments have proved the certainty
and facility with which they can be made
in the laboratory. The process is simply
an imitation of the method that nature
pursues to get, rid of the poison, for the
ur?t thing that she does when a bacterial
germ or its products are introduced into
the body is to introduce an increased oxi
dation, which shows itself to us in the
fever."
TWAS A LOVE-FEAST.
Old Officers Re-elected at the First
Congregational Church Conven
tion Last Night.
To all appearances the dove of peace has
at last spread its snowy wings over the
First Congregational Church. "The
hatchet," as a member expressed it, "has
been buried 'neatn the sod, and the white
rose of concord flourishes o'er the crave."
This reunion occurred last ni^ht at the
annual church convention, held in the
basement of the church. Prominent in
the reinvigorated organization looms up
the personality of Dr. George C. Adams,
the new pastor from St. Louis.
The meeting was rather large until to
' ward the close. Then about balf the
members present took it for eranted that
nothing out of the ordinary was likely to
ensue, and either went home or stood out
s.de in groups amiably discussing the sit
uation. â 
Many heretofore regarded as bitter par
tisans were present, among them being
Mrs. French, Dr. McDonald, Attorney
Nagle and Sexton Pike. Mrs. Cooper,
owing to the illness of" her daughter, was
absent.
That many feared trouble in spite of the
Napoleonic leadership of Dr. Adams was
evident from the references made now and
then throughout the proceedings to parti
sanship, anÂ«l, in fact, a few light refer
ences from the pastor himself.
At the opening of proceedings Deacon
Morse sat with a look of determination
plainly expressed on his visage, while
Deacon Vasconcelles stroked his patri
archal beard in a subdued manner.
First came the report of Clem Christen
sen. It showed 900 members on the church
roll as opposed to 935 at the time Dr

Brown and the ecclesiastic council tilted

Deacon Vasconcellos reported that the
total collection for the benevolent fund
during the year was $llb'9 71. The dis
bursements tallied.
Deacon Mor^e gave a verbal report on
the Sunday-school. During Dr. Adams'
pastorate ox eight weeks, he sad, the
Sunday-school had increased from half to
three-quarters its former size.
Then came the nominations fÂ«r de:Â«
cons, the terras of threeâ Hatch, Vascon
cellos and Barnardâ having expired.
Now there was a ripple oi exoteraent
and a few scathing words from Dr. Adams.
About a dozen nominations w iv uaue
and the result was that Dencons Hitch,
Vasconcelios ana Barnard succeeded
themselves.
The total vote cast was 401. Vase n
cellos received 90, Barnard 110 and H:i ck
104. The rest were scattering.
The assembly drew* a lonp brect .: ar.d
wasted no time in nominating At cv
Woodiiams and M. W. Lit*lÂ«fi d
clerk. The ballot stood 69 for Woodh ira 1
DAN MILLER, the Jealous Murderer.
and 72 for Littlelield. On Woodharas'
motion it was made unanimous.
Indicative of the feeling underneath the
surface was the action oi Attorney L. If.
Spencer in opposing the recommendation
of Deacon Morse for superintendent of the
â¢Sun iay-school by the committee nomi
nating Dr. McDonald. The nomination
of McDonald was seconded by H. G.
Adams. Morse got so many more votes
than McDonald in the informal ballot
that his election was made by acclamation.
It now began to dawn upon the assem
blage that Dr. Brown's friends n-ere
present in force. It was so; they had
practically no opposition.
Deacon Vasconcellos was elected to suc
ceed himself as treasurer, with a few votes
scattering. Rev. Dr. Warren and Deacons
Morse and Dexter were elected to serve
with the pastor on the installation com
mittee. Installation and unfinished busi
ness will be carried out next Wednesday
evening.
Besides the deacons and the new clerk
the standing church committee for the
coming year will consist of Messrs.
Westgate, Woodhams, McDonald, Chiids
and Chrisiensen.
Dr. Willey closed the meeting with a
prayer eulogizing the pastor and express
ing thanks to the Savior for the happy
termination of the meetine.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19. 1596.
JEALOUSY PROMPTS
AN AWFUL MURDER
John Miller Shoots George
H. Childs in Cold
Blocd.
Childs Was Trying to Protect
Miller's Mistress From
His Attack.
He Fired Four Shots at Mrs. Ryan on
Clementina Street â F Jaquith
the Cause.
An awful tragedy was enacted at 425
Clementina street yesterday afternoon in
which youne Georjre H". Childs, aged 22
years, and the only support of a widowed
mother, two younger brothers and four
listers, was shot and instantly killed by
John Miller, a carpenter engaged in busi
ness at 947 Fo'som street.
Tho murder was committed in the
presence of several witnesses while Childs
was endeavoring to stay tho murderous
hand of the assassin from killing his
mistress. The name of the woman in the
case is Nellie Ryan, who was divorced
from her husband some time ago, and
until the last few days has been consort
ing with Miller.
The Ryan woman in the last few days
has been staying Iwith Mrs. 'William
Burns at 40fi Clementina street. Mrs.
Burns was also taking care of her small
son.
About a month ago the woman met Fred
Jaquitb, a rlaslerer quartered at the
Central Hotel on Tlr.rd street, near Bran
nan, ana was at once smitten with him.
j Oa several occasions he took her out to
supper, generally to the Nevada restaurant
on Fourth street, near Mission.
This aroused Miller's jealousy and Tues
day .be followed her about and made such
\vi:d threats that Mrs. Ryan complained
to Officer H. H. Murphy, who arrested
Miller. He was bailed out and yesterday
started ou*t with the evident intention of
killing his former female associate.
About 10 o'clock a. m. he called at the
Central Hotel and inquired for Jaquitb,
who was at work. . Then he went to Mr.
Burns' home, at 406 Clementina street,
and asked for Mrs. Ryan. She war, not in,
but in emerging from the house he met
her. Then came the shooting as de
scribed by eyewitnesses.
She started to run up Clementina street
with Miller following. Though he fired
four shots none took effect. When the
frighiered woman reached No. 425 the
door was standing open and in she ran.
Miiler attempted to follow, bin was inter
cepted by young Child?, who was attracted
to the doorway by the shooting.
Ctiilds grappled with Milier. The latter
raised his revolver and shot Childs in the
forehead. As he fell the assassin sent an
other shot into his prostrate body and
! then ran on to the residence of J. F. Fitz
gerald at No. 429.
He tried to enter, but as soon as Fitz
gerald saw his revolver he closed and
(jarred the door. Miller then descended
to the lowest cellar, the entrance being in
front of the house, and began to reload his
weapon.
He was industriously engaged in this
work when Officer McGee arrived upon
the scene and commanded him to surren
der. He made a threatening motion with
his revolver and MiGee fired at him. the
bullet missing and entering tho side of the
house.
Before the oflicer could repeat the shot
Miller rushed at him and presented bis
weapon in the region of McGpe'.^ stomach.
He would undoubtedly have added an
other murder to his record had it not
been for the prompt action of M. Savage,
! a resident of- the vicinity and eyewitness
of the shooting, who grubbed him.
McGeo and Savage together ov rpow
ered the murderer and he was handcuffed
and taken to the City Prison.
Mrs. Burns Btates that Milier ha 3 hung
round the house of late and caused her hus
band to go on a drunken spree. Jaquith,
I when interviewed at thp Central Hotel,
i claimed that his connection with Mrs.
j Ryan has been very slight and said he
i had met Miller only once, and that time
at Burns' house, Monday evening last,
when M. Her was abusing his female com
panion for her unfaithfulness.
Childs has been a distributor for the
B!erling<fc Dunphy Bill-posting Company
at 538 Commercial street.

covered from nis excitement. He talked
quietly and delioerately.
"1 shot at the woman," he snid, "be
cause 1 meant to kill her. I don't know
whether I killed anybody, but I am sorry
I didn't kill her. She is not my wtfp, but
we have been living together for two
years. She left me tnree or four days ago
and went to live with a plasterer.
â¢'Her name is Nellie Ryan and she is
about 28 years of age. She is a divorced
woman and has a boy about 7 years of
age who lived with us at 1149 Folsom
street, where I had my carpenter's shop.
She took the boy away with her when she
left me.
â¢Why did I want to kill her? Well,
she spent all my monej* with other men.
Seven years ago when I came here I was
worth $."0,000, now it is all gone. I lost
most oi it In the Los Angeles boom and
she has robbed me of the balance.
"She was divorced from her husband,
who hud a restaurant on Third street, after
she had ruined him. Then she started a
i-aloon at IS Teham?. i>tre- 1, and it was
there I first met her. I fitted up a place
for her on Hov.ard street at a cost of |SO,
and after a while she consented to come
and live with me. That is about two years
ago.
'After she left me I went to her on Mon
day last and wanted her to come back, but
she wouldn't, and had me arrested for dis
turbing the peace. I was released on
bonds, and yesterday morning the case
came up in Judge Low a court and was
continued till Thursday.
"Since my release on Monday I had
been trying to find her and discovered
that she was at the Central Hotel on
Third street, living with a plasterer. I
went there to-day but she had gone.
Then I went to 406 Clemeutina street,
where her boy was living, and louncl her
there. I had my pistol with me, as I
meant to kill her if she wouldn't go back
to live with me. The woman of the house
got me to go upstairs and I beard Nellie
talking downstairs, and then she left the
house. I went after her and overtook her
on the street. I asked her to go back with
me, but she laughed at me. so I pulled
out my tevolver and she ran into a house
as I tired at her. Then I was arrested.
"\es, I liked the woman ana wanted
her back, although I knew she was a hard
case. I wish I had killed her."
Miller Baid he came here from Dallas,
Tex., in 18S9, leaving his wile there.
About four years ano she got a divorce

the strength of a promise to marry her,
but the case was allowed to drop. He is a
hunchback, and is 40 years of age.
The woman, Ryan, was taken to the City
Prison by Policemen T. Uurke ana P. Me-
Gee last evening. Miller was brought out
of his cell and she was asked if he was tlie
man who firel the shots at her.
"Yes," she said, as s.'ie looked with
snapping eyes at Miller; "that is t!ie
cripple, John Miller, who tried to kill me."
Miller did not say a word, but returned
her glance of hate with compound interest.
bhe admitted having lived with Miller,
and said she wanted to get rid of him. He
did not say anything to her before he
pulled out his pistol. Then she ran
screaming along the street and he tired at
her. She is a big, stout woman.
