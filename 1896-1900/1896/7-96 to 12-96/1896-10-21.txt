MARSHFIELD, Or., OcL 20.â The steam

this morning on the Coos Bay bar and the
lives of thirteen persons lost. They were:

Ben . me-s boy.

mate; Spaulis, Manin, Ross, Bergman,
McKipping, H. Brown, seamen ; Moore,
fireman; White, cook; Bargetta, White,
Holden, waiters; A. Painter, Â£. No3ler,
passengers.
The Arago arrived from San Francisco
on Monday morning ana took on a cargo
of 750 tons of coal and a small quantity of
miscellaneous freight at Marshfield, leav
ing the latter place some time during the
night. She reached Empire City all right,
and there took on several passengers, all
bound for San Francisco. At 7:30 o'clock
this morning she left Empire" City, arriv
ing off the bar about half an hour later.
Bbc reached a point about opposite the
outer end of the Government jetty in
safety.
At this point some 200 feet of the trestle
work surmounting the partially con
structed breakwater was carried away by
last winter's storms, leaving a reef of
rocks very dangerous to any vessel which
hould unfortunately deviate from her

course. The tide had been flooding but a
short time and the bar was breaking
badly.
A strong westerly swell has been rolling
in for the pa>-t two days, culminating this
morning in immense breakers crossing the
bar in every direction and lashing it into
vast billows of foam. It was an anery sea
and ore in which no prudent captain
ought to have trusted the lives of his pas
senerers and the safety of his ship. It is
supposed that Captain Reed realized the
dangerous character of the sea which was
breaking and stepped to reconnoiter be
fore crossing the bar. At all events, when
near the extreme end of the jetty, the en
gines were slowed down and the speed per
ceptibly decreased. In feet, tne vessel ap
peared to stop for a few moments. Whether
the skipper decided within himself to take
the chances and endeavor to cross the bar
or to put about and re-enter the bay is
nor known, but at this time the vessel
took a sudden she^r, refused to answer her
helm, and carried Dy the strong northerly
set of the current in a moment was upon
the submerged rocks of the partially con
structed jetty. She struck so hard that a
hole was stove into her bottom directly
under the engine-room.
A few seconds later the chief engineer
Walter R. Brown, Chief Engineei
of the Arago.
reported to the captain that the water was
c â¢mine into the engine room. The vessel,
however, cleared the jetty, passing directly
across it. An effort was then made to run
her through the line of breakers and into
the smooth water beyond, out she filled
r idly and sank about a quarter of a mile
f -â  m where she struck, and a little to the

northward of the jetty, in the midst of the
breakers.
In a few moments all of her houses and
upper works were carried away, as were
also the life-rafts and some of the boats.
The purser was washed overboard, but
was returned by the next wave. Grasping
the rail, he climbed on board, and, seeing
a boat, jumped into it. At this time a
steerage passenger was seen to go over
board, and a second later John Norman,
a leading citizen of Marshfield, who bad
been hanging to the rigging, was washed
away and was not seen again.
In the midst of the confusion two boats
had been launched. The first and
second officers, the captain, five of the
crew and one passenger bad taken to the
rieging, and the rest, with the exception
of the chief engineer, who was not visible,
took to the boats. The captain, from his
position in the rigging, directed the officers
in the boats.
A few seconds later the chief engineer
was seen floating on a quantity of wreck
age and was assisted into the first officer's
boat much exhausted. For over two hours
the boats were tossed about, at one
moment controlled by the oars, the next
wholly at the mercy of the sea, the hands
that guided them 'endeavoring to find a
favorable opening to break through the
breakers. The first officer's boat finally
capsized, and all of its occupants were
drowned with the exception of the first
officer, the first and second assistant en
gineers and a sailor, who swam to and
was assisted into the second r ffieer's boat.
Without further mi-hap the latter craft
was finally piloted safely through the line
of breakers and into the bay, landing
at the Government works.
The liie-suving crew lad been called
upon, but, owing to the great distance of
the station irom the scene of the wreck,
did not reach it until about three hours
afterward. When they did arrive on the
scene, howev r, they did noble worK, and,
after much difficulty, succeeded in reach
ing the wreck and taking; off the captain
and the six others who clung to the
rigging.
At the time of the disaster the bar tug Co
lumbia, Captain Magee, was following
closely in the wake of the Arago and, it
would appear, ought to have rendered
valuable assistance. All she did, how
ever, was to notify the caretakers at the
Government works that a wreck bad oc
curred, then steam off to North Bend,
some seven miles distant, to rop-. rt. Had
the tv returned to the scene of the wreck
or adjacent thereto she could have ren
dered valuable assistance in towing the
lifeboat and thus saved much time. Had
the life-saving crew been able to get to the
scene without loss of time there as but lit
tle doubt that all or nearly all of the lives
could have been saved. Captain Magee
of the tug justifies his course by stating
t at his owners' instructions are that
whenever any trouble occurs on the bar
to report to headquarters at North Bend
for instructions.
Nothing is to be seen of the wreck at
this time but her mast. A portion of the
hull will probably *De visible at low tide.
Although the vessel's manifest shows a
cargo of but 760 tons, yet miny persons
who suw her before leaving Empire City
this morning express the opinion that she
was more heavily laden than ever before,
and while she may not have been danger
ously so they question the wisdom of load
ing her to her utmost capacity.
HISTORY OF THE A RAGO.
First Steel Hhip Eirr Built by the TTnion
Iron Works.
The officers of the wrecked Arngo were:
A. Reed, master; C. F. McCollum, purser;
F. Warner, first officer; J. Banks, second
officer; W. E. Brown, chief engineer; F.
Croghan, first assistant engineer; P.
FrieJ, second assistant engineer; R. Pat
terson, steward; Francisco Fernandez,
head cook; P. Mvs t, second cook.
The Arngo was the first steel ship ever
built by the Union Iron Works. She was
of 947 torn gross- burden, 200 feet long, 30
feet broad and 16 feet deep. After being
fitted out in 1885 she was'put in the coal
trade between here and Coos Bay and has
remained on that route ever since. Nearly
all the officers have been in her lor years,
and they considered her the smartest ship
ol her size on the coast.
Formerly she had no upper cabins
amidships, but when the trade increased
the alterations were made, and ever since
-he has been a favonle with the traveling
public.
The Coos Bay bar has always been con
sidered the most treacherous on the
coast. It is only a couple of years ago
since the whaleback Wetmore went
ashore on the very same spit that cause 1
the wreck of the Arago. The Whetmore
was never eot off, and the latest news
trom the Arago reads: "All that's left of
the steamer is two spars projecting on the
beach." The tank steamer Bawnmore
also went ashore near the same spit and
went to pieces.
Of all the numerous steamer wrecks on
the coast during the past tew years only
three have been accompanied with loss of
life. The Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's Los Angeles went ashore and eight
lives were lost. The Colima disaster is still
ire-h in everybody's mind and now comes
the loss of the Arago.
Pilots and captains of coasters all report
a heavy swell and a very heavy current
setting inshore for the past few days. At
times it would be perfectly calm and then
in an hour a tremendous sea would get
up. Captain Jordan, the pilot, brought in
the Wennineton Hall last Monday and re
ported a perfectly smooth bar. An hoar
later Captain Freeman drought in the 8.
P. Hitchcock and the bar was breaking.
From this fact seamen argue that some
thing similar happened at Coos Bay and
the heavy swell and treacherous inset put
t c steamer on the north spit.
CONGRESSMAN BOUTELLE of Maine Greeting the People of California With Assurances of Republican
Success and the Return of Prosperity.
MR. BRYAN IS A
PUBLIC ENEMY
A Man Who Counsels Half
the People to Cheat
the Other Half.
Rousing Speech of Congressman
Boutelle at Woodward's
Pavilion.
OUTPOURING OF THE PEOPLE.
How That "Crime ot '73" Has Been
Nothing More Than Misleading
C mpaign Lies.
Was it a climax? Can anything further
be done to demonstrate more forcibly that
the people want McKinley and a return of
prosperity, and will have them?
The vast area of Woodward's Pavilion
was packed early last evening, and the
proceedings had to be delayed while busy
ushers pushed and shoved to find room
for the throng that still clamored for a
place within the sound of tne speaker's
voice. It was certainly an insmrins spec
tacle, a great political event, before a word
nad been spoken. The great pavilion was
almost bare of bunting or any of those ac
cessories that are called in at times to help
to emphasize the spirit of an occasion.
Their very absence, however, in the
presence of this great multitude of en
thusiastic people seemed to score its point.
When the speaker, accompanied by
Chairman Frank Mclaughlin of the State
,Central Committee, Irving M. Scott and
other leaders, entered the hall the great
audience rose to its feet and nearly lifted
the roof from the building. The cheering
continued long after the party reacned the
platiorm.
Mr. McLaughlin introduced Irving M.
Scott as chairman of the evening, and Mr.
Scott at once rose to an introduction of
Mr. Boutelle-
He did it well. He said that the visitor
was one of the most distinguished states
men of tiie time; that he had been the
right-hand man and confidential friend of
James G. Blame; that like that peerless
American he had been a friend of the
West and of California; that to his hone t
endeavors was largely due the rehabilita
tion of the American navy, and to hit un-
Sagging championship California was
especially indebted for the honor of
building a part of it. He had sent the
contract here for the building of the
Charleston and was about to send a con
tract for building a still greater warship,
to be called the California. Mr. Scott
asked that be be given the warmest recep
tion that had ever been tendered a public
speaker in California.
And he was â at least if any other has
called out more enthusiasm there is no
acute recollection of it. When he rose
the big house shook with the palpitating
air.
"Mr. Chairman and friends and neigh
bors of San Francisco," he said, "the
magnificence of your greeting here to
night, lacking nothing of the elements of
your sptendid and generous hospitality,
impresses upon me my inadequacy to de
serve sucn a superb reception. The State
of Maine â :> [Long and loud applause.]
"I hope the boys will hear this back in
Maine."
"Three cheers for Maine," shouted an
auditor, and the response was prompt,
hearty and thunderously vociferous. Con
tinuing Congressman Boutelle said:
"They sent their message to you early
in September."
"We'll give 'em our answer on the 3d of
November," came a shout from one of the
galleries.
"They wait for your response. They
have no doubt what that response will be,
and neither have I," said the speaker.
"My State recognizes a long and unliqui
dated credit in behalf of the State of Cali
fornia. We owe you people a debt, which
we have never been able to pay, and which
we never want to see wholly discharged,
because we prefer to feel under a continual
obligation to the people of the Pacific
Slope.
"We can never forget the loyalty and
enthusiasm with which you people fol
lowed and uplifted the banner of our great
chic tain during all the period from 1876
to 1892. And as long as memory lasts in
the Pine Tree State the name of California
will be linked With the name of the peer
less fame of James G. Blame. [Great ap
plause.]
"I wish he could be here to-night in
place of myself to speak to you again as
he has so often spoken in the past, always
and everywhere in favor of the uplifting
of the National credit and the National
honor. In my poor way lam glad to feel
that I can bring you here to-night from
Maine in less beautiful rhetoric and in
less forcible argument the counsel and ap
peal that Blame would have uttered if he
stood here on this platform to-night.
"I hope no one in this marvelous gather
ing has for a moment the idea that I have
come across the continent â 3000 miles of
our great domain â with the foolish expec
tation of bringing information to this
great, progressive and intelligent com
munity.
'That is not the purpose of my visit.
I can say to you at the outset that I have
no hope whatever of imparting any infor
mation or instruction to this great people,
so large a portion of whom are honoring
me here to-night.
"I have come to you simply to bring
from the East and the Central States,
your common country, the outstretched
hand of Republicanism and the sound,
patriotic Democracy of that section of our
country to grasp hands with California in
devotion to the best welfare of our com
mon country. [Great applause.]
"I do not know just how many thousand
miles I have traveled, and if they had
been counted by ten times the number I
should have felt more than repaid for
whatever of effort and fatigue it has cost
me to enjoy the never-to-be-forgotten
honor and privilege of facing this mag
nificent gathering of my fellow-citizens
here to-night. [Great applause.]
"I am glad to feel that however long the
steel rails have stretched out, over what
ever stretches of territory I may have
been borne, thank God, I have never found
what appeared to me as the enemies of the
country. ["Uproarious applause.]
"I stard here in San Francisco similarly
to the way I would stand in Maine â in the
house of my friends. [Cheers.] I have not
come here to-night to bear you a message
from any class of our people; I bare not
come to plead the interests of any special
portion of the American people; I am not
here in the interest of a party that confines
itself to any portion of tho country. I
stand a humble but sincere champion of
the great political organization which
bears on its shield the uplifting ana the
welfare of every man, woman and child in
the American Republic. [Great and con
tinued applause.
"I shall have failed disastrously in my
purpose if any man or woman shall leave
this building to-night with heart embit
tered against any of their fellow-citizens,
if what I shall say shall have the effect oi
making one portion of the people turn
against another. I am here to proclaim
the principles of the grand old Republican
party, the giorious old Republican party,
the same grand old organization that,
marching under the only banner it ever
did, unfurled the star-spangled banner,
and bore the ark of our covenant through
the red sea of Civil War, and from that
hour to the present has never wavered in
any policy that went to the uplifting of
the American people. [Uproarious ap
plause, mingled with cheers and shunts of
"Hurrah!"]
'-My friends, we are in the midst of a
remarkable campaign; we are nearing the
close of the most amazing contest in the
annals of the American Republic or of
any other people, and when I faco an in

manifestation of pride in our party and
confidence In its good intentions, I marvel
that either I or any other man should be
called upon to defend the republic from
such an assault as is now menacing not
only its security but its life. I speak with
the words of absolute conviction and sin
cerity when I say that starting from
Northeastern Maine â I hail froru where

mind is an unparalleled upheaval of the

that great banner as trnly democratic as
it was when carried in the battlefields so
long ago. [Cheers and applause.]
"There are men here honoring me with
their presence to-night who know how
much there is in what I say when I bear
testimony to the difficulty that confronts
members of that organization in shaking
off party discipline and the control of or
ganization. Party harness has rested far
more lightly upon the Republican party
than on the old Democracy. We have
been accustomed to be far more lenient
with our members than that organization
which worships at the shrine of Thomas
Jefferson and Andrew Jackson.
"We have reached a period and a con
dition where that great political party has
been rent in twain as by the parting of
the veil. It is a significant sight to the
American people and ought to have a tre
mendous weight in the present campaign.

app'ause.]

When the applause had subsided and
the speaker could be heard he eaid, "and
now, my friends, let us auticipate the

country November 3 by rising to our feet
and giving three cheers for William Mc-

The challenge was uproariously re
sponded to. Canes and handkerchiefs and
hats went into the air like a night of
birds. Resuming the speaker said:

of your able representative, Mr. Loud, to

to a district to have the benefit of the in

"There ia no name that stands higher in

Munhall of England on the question of
the progress of the peoples of the earth.
He is a student in this field, and in taking
hia data from the American census, says:
'It would be impossible to find any paral
lel in all history for the progress in wealth
of the American people for the period from
18S0 to 1890. ' Thai was the period when
tbe industries of the country enjoyed the
beneficent protection of the McKinley

"Now, my friends, 1 know that in my
own part of the country a great disaster
lias fallen as a result oi that unhappy leg
islation. - We are not doing the work that
we used to do and that we ouirbt to do.
The work they used to do, the values they
usrd to receive, have been transit rred
to England. Oar people do not like it.
Tbe sound cf the spindle was one tine
bweeter to my ear in my own little town
than was the song of birds. For it was
the symbol cf the prosperity ot a good
people. I was up there laat sumrcer.
There was the same beautiful picture. The
sun shone, the river sparkled under it, tho
trees trembled and fluttered in tbe soft
wind, and in their branches the birds sang.
But the mills â ah, there was a pall upon
the landscape. The mills were silent; the
song of the spindle was not there.
"I was in England since then. I saw an
English wool manufacturer. He told me
that be was enjoying great prosperity; his
mills were running right along and he was
laving the foundaiion for a new mill. He
congratulated ma on the fact that
our people had come to a proper
sense of political economy and had
repealed that McKinley bill which
he declared was contrary to every
principle of right. He realiy had no no
tion of the relationship between the clos
ing of the mills in our own country and
the opening of the mills in his. The
last year of the operation of the McKin
ley bill $86,000,000 was paid in waees to
toe wool-workers of this country, and in
the past year $40,000,000 was paid in such
wages, no Itta than $46,000,000 that should
be circulating amon^ the people of the
country has gone lo England. And ail
those dollars were good American dollars,
worth 100 cents, and not dollars that

I the question for a day who does not know
Ithat prosperity cannot be obtained in any
unless the wage-earners are
allowed to work and earn and spend their
wages. I have heard it said that what we
want in this country is more money. That
3s true. As the American people do not
steal their money, the presumption crocs
that what they wan t is a chance to earn
their money. [Applause.]

in this country who is now, from the tail
board of a train or under the kerosene

[Great applause.] Now 1 happen to know
that counterfeiters are not rich. They
are just the poorest lot ot folks that come
in contact with the police. [Laughter.]
Now I want to treat a serious matter
seriously. I would treat it more so than
I do, perhaps, if the man I am talking
about would do so. Now the idea of any
man trying to prove to you that what is
the matter witd this country to-day was
caused by something that happened in
1873.
'"I he thine Is so clear, the ailment may
be so easily traced to unsound legislation
since then" that it seems almost idle to
point it out. I haye never seen any so
called argument in behalf of coining silver
at 16 to 1 that was not based on statements
as unsubstantial as the fabric of a dream.
They say that by a stroke of a pen in 1873
one-half of the circulating medium was
demonetized. That was the alleged crime
of 1873. They reason it out in this way:
Gold is one, silver is another â that is two;
silver was demonetized. Ergo, half the
currency was withdrawn.
"Now. when we consider that \ip to that
time only 8,031,000 silver dollars had been
coined, bow absurd that Â«tatement is ap
pears at once. But silver was not demone
tized in 1873. Every dollar that had been
coined remained where it was, as good or
better than it was before, acceptab.e in the
market for its face value.
"But listen: The same act by which the
cnxne of 73 was committed, and aiiver as
they say was demonetized, provided lor
the coining of the millions of trade dol
lars. Mir.d you, before that time, for
thirty years, not a silver dollar had been
coined. Then in 1878, just five years after
that crime, the Bland-Allison act was
passed, under which 400,000,000 silver dol
lars were coined to offset that poor little
8,000.000. But still the unsatisfied mine
owners demanded that the Government
purchase faster, and in response
the so-called Sherman act was passed
that provided that $4,500,000 worth of
siiver bullion be purchased every month
and stored away, it could not be coined
fast enough. They piled it up in ingots
and set the prpsspsrunninf? to print silver
certificates. Under that law $100,000,000
worth was purchased. Since the 'crime of
'73,' when $8,000,000 was in circulation, ,
no less than $600,000,000 has been added
to the silver currency and still the price of
silver went down, down, down, until there
was only 50 cents' worth of silver behind
the silver dollar.
"Now, does Mr. Bryan think tne people
of the United States are fools that he is
trying to make them believe the despond
encyorevailine in this country results from
the 'crime of 73? I can tell you how to
raise tne price of silver if you don't Know
iv Just destroy haif there is in existence.
And I'll give you another tip. Lat this
country become a constant buyer; let
the Rothschilds send over their stamping
machines ana American (tenius invent
still faster machines for the coining of sil
ver and the price of silver will go down.
The reason why it fell during the opera
tion of the Snerman act was because peo
ple began to wonder how Ion? the United
States could keep up the purchase.
"Confidence was shaken, and there is
more good business done on confidence
than on coin [Applause.] A Democratic
chief magistrate and a Democratic Secre
tary of tue Treasury who had been making
free-silver speeches and believing them,
just as Bryan in bis ignorance believes
what he say's, called upon Congress to re
pent the S.erman act.
"Mr. Bryan quotes the language of Mr.
B-aine from a speech iv wnicn that great
statesman was distinctly and strongly op
posing the free coinage of silver, at a time
when there was only 8 cents difference be
tween the value 01 the silver dollar and its
weight in bullion. He was saying that he
desired to foster the industry so far as it
could be uone sa:ely, and with a full
knowledge of tbe misconstruction Mr.
Bryan and his followers coniinue to quote
those words.
"Immediately after Mr. Bryan had suc
ceeded in hypnotizing the Chicago con
vention into nominating him For tbe
Presidency he went down to New York,
into the camp of the enemy, as he said, to
teach them finance. There lie made a
studied statement of bis position. There
were two points in that speech that call
for our attention. He said that he wished
to see it possible for a man to ro into tbe
open market ana purchase silver bullion,
for every 412 grains of which be might
pay off $1 o: his debts. In other words he
wants to make it possible for a man in
debt to clear himselfat half cost.
â¢â¢\Vnat do you think George Washing
ton would say to a proposition of that
kind? Well, advertising burglars do
not succeed in their trade. Should tbe
morning papers on the 4th of November
announce that Mr. Bryan had been elected
I fear to contemplate the extent of tiie
ca amity. It wou^d be an advertisement to
every bduk, insurance company and other
security concerns that they were to be
plundered, a:.d it would daieat its own
end. ,
"Between the 4th of November and tbe
4th of March we woulii see the most awful
liquidation that was ever witnessed on
carth â men climbing over each other to
collect what was due them. The mind
recoils with horror from the spectacle of
what wouid follow. You know how the
b>g merchan: 'carries' tbe smaller one lor
months and how in such cases any clam
oring for their due would bring ruin.
â 'Well, imagine whit would take place
in the cases ot the tens of thousands of the
small merchants when the big one swoops
down upon them for an immediate settle
ment. , â¢
â¢But I do not fear. I trust in the in
telligence of the American people. They
know that the man who counsels half of
the people to inaugurate a policy under
which ttiey may chea; tbe other half is a
public enemy.' r [Great applause.]
Coatsres^man Houtelle concluded his
oration with a quotation from Longfel
low's "Snip of State" aruid tremendous
and lon^-continued applause. As soon as
he could make himse:i heard, Irving Mr.
Scott proposed three cheers for Boutelle
and throe for McKinley and Hooart,
which were given with a will and voice
that made the rafters of the huge building

TER RE HAUTE, Ind., Oct. 20.â There
were 3000 persons at the track to see John
R. Gentry make the attempt for the record
of 2:00 for a harness horse, and they were
sadly disappointed. The air was chilly
and there was some wind from the north
catching tne horse at the third quarter of
the mile, but it was not thought to be
strong enough to defeat him in the task.
In the trial he went away well and made
the first quarter ia :31^4, and was at the
half in l:00>Â£ and at the three-quarters in
The mile so far was exactly rated as
Andrews wanted it to make the two
minute mark or 1:59 H. But the horse
weakened on the turn into the stretch,
and came under the wire very tired iv
2:o4}Â£. Andrews says it was caused by
lack of work. The horse was simply not
keyed up for the full length of the mile.

LOST OFF LOCUST POINT.
Mystery Surrounds the Foundering of a

BANDUSKY, Ohio, Oct. 30.â News was
received here to-day that a vessel found
ered in the lake off Locust Point some
time during last week. Captain Cleaves
and a crew of fishermen nearing their
rounds last Thursday noticed a lot of
wreckage, and with the aid of a glass they
were able to see a spar projecting from the
water some distance away. An investiga
tion was made and it was found that a
vessel bad been auuk and the captain is of
the opinion it was a steamer. There was
nothing in sight by which the name of
the boat could be ascertained, and no in
formation has been received from any
port that a boat has been lost, but it is
certain that a vessel went down at that
point and probably with all on board.

STREETCAR MEN MEET,
Some Interesting Exhibits and
Papers Before the American
Association
Bicycles Give the Various Suburban
Companies Uneasiness and Lessen
Patronage.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 20.â The immense
floor space in the Auditorium is covered
with streetcars, trucks and all manner of
modern vebic.es on exhibition at the
fifteenth annual convention of the Ameri
can Street Railway Association, which
began this morning. This is the greatest
exhibition of its kind ever given in this
country. Over 200 representatives of
streetcar manufacturers are in attendance.
To-day's session was opened with prayer,
after which Mayor Nagel welcomed the
visitors. President H. M. Littell of New
York delivered his annual address, during
wnich he said tbe association is to be con
gratulated on the fact that during the past
year no deaths have occurred in its ranks.
Papers of great value and interest will
be read on tbe subjects of tracks and track
jointing, construction and maintenance,
trucks, how the street railways can be in
creased, modern power-house and selection
and management of employes. President
Littell depreciated the crowing disposi
tion of Government, both State and muni
cipal, to increase the burden of taxation
for street railways. With reference to
the bicycle as a means of reduced rev
enues, he said:
"No doubt the bicycle has come to stay,
and no doubt upon suburban routes its
competition has been serious, but it is
still to a great extent a novelty, and when
the effects of the novelty have worn off
and tbe use of the bicycle is limited to
those who habitually make use of it all
their lives I think there will still be found
quite enough people who prefer street
cars as a means of locomotion, even in
places where tbe bicycle can be used."
The report of Secretary Pringley showed
the association to be prosperous in finances
and membership. The Buffalo and Niagara
Falls Electric Railway was elected to
membership in tbe association.

CARNEGIE'S CLEAR VIEWS
Business Activity, He Says, De
pends Upon the Election
of McKinley.
If a Man of Bryan's Stamp Is Elected
Commercial Affairs Will Be
Paralyzed.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Oct. 20.â Andrew
Carnegie leaves for New York to-morrow
morning, alt-r spending several days in
Pi ttsburg attending to business matters.
Before leaving, Mr. Carnegie complied
with the requests of the newspapers for an
interview upon politics and business
matters. When asked for his opinion
whether McKinley would be elected he
said :
"Yes, I am quite sure of it; the only
question is one of majority."
"What do you think of the outlook for
business?"
"That depends upon the election of the
candidate who represents honest money,
law and order. If a man like Mr. Bryan
is elected and such men as would com
pose bis Cabinet were placed in charge of
the Nation by the American people there
would be a paralysis of business, but if
McKinley is elected I believe the country
is going to have a period of prosperity
that will rank with any in its history.
The country has been depressed for some
years, prices for all commodities are low,
stocks are light; wheat, cotton and pro
visions are in demand ; the country
will gain nearly $250,000,000 over last
year in its trade balances with other
nations; the money of the world is lying
anxious to invest in the United States,
and it will be largely invested whenever
it is satisfied that the American people
have resolved to pay in the same money
as they have received â namely, gold.
; 'lt is no advantage to an employer to
pay his workmen with silver dollars. If
every employer is able to do so then all
are relatively in the same position as be
fore. The change from gold to silver
would precipitate such a panic as would
cause employers to lose hundreds of thou
sands of dollars, and it would cause large
concerns to lose millions."

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TOUR*
In the Principal Speech of the Day
the Statesman Argues Against
Cheap Money.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 20.â Severa
hundred people were at the Union station
to-day when the special traiu carrying
General Harrison on his two days' stamp
ing tour of the southern portion of
Indiana, departed at 9 o'clock. The
general was accompanied by Colonel B.
H. Nebekeru, W. L. Ketcham and Private
Secretary Tibbott. The crowd waited
quietly for a few minutes and then some
one started a cry for "Harrison." It was
immediately taken up by the remainder
of the crowd, and General Harrison re
sponded by stepping to the platform and
raising his silk hat. He said nothing,
however, and returned to his car.
At the hamlet of Paragon, several
hundred people stopped the train, and
General Harmon came out long enough
to greet them with a word. At Spencer
he was greeted by about 6000 people, and
made an address of fifteen minutes, de
voted entirely to the currency question.
It was a big day for Wortbington. A
procession of uniformed marching clubs
and decorated wagons, headed by a Tippe
canoe log cabin, paraded the streets, and
it was estimated that 20,000 people were
in town, though not more than half of
them heard General Harrison's speech. In
his address he referred to Bryan's remarks
about Jekylls and Hydes. He said he had
no disposition to retaliate in the use of
opprobrious epithets. Thii remark of Mr.
Bryan showed that he had possibly lost
his temper, and he was very sure that in
making it he had lost his sense of the pro
prieties of the great position to which he
aspired.
After the Worthineton stop lunch was
served on the train, but it was not finished,
for a crowd of about 1500 coal-miners had
gathered at Bushrod, a station with hut
one house in it, and General Harrison left
the lunch-table to talk to them. He ap
pealed to them as wage-earners, and ex
plained that in a time of fluctuation of the
values of currency the man who works for
wages is always the one to suffer first and
most.
Brief stops were made at Sunborn and
at Edwardsport, where something over
1000 were addressed for a few minutes.
At Vincennss there was a tremendous
crowd. A stand bad been erected in an
open field near the station, and the crowd j
of 8000 people surged over two or three
acres oi ground in their efforts to get near
enough to see and hear. General Harri
son made an intensely earnest speech of
thirty minutes, in the course of which he
argued the money question as thoroughly
as the limited time would permit. At the
next stop, Princeton, a gathering in
excess of anything that had been encoun
tered was met with.
Two thousand men met the train at the
station and followed General Harrison's
carriage, half a mile, to the fair grounds,
where a crowd of people, estimated at
from 20,000 to 25.000, had been waiting
several hours. Tne amphitheater, hold
ing 5000 people, held but a small section
of the crowd that spread and jostled and
pushed over the ground in front. The
gold-colored bunting pervaded and cov
ered everything. Gold-colored hats,
aashes and belts were everywhere and
hundreds of the girls and women wore
waists of yellow cloth. General Harri
son's speech at this point was about forty
minutes in length and more elaborate
than any he had made during the day.
The train arrived at Evansville shortly
after 6 o'clock and was met by a great
crush of people at the station. General
Harrison remained in his car and had
supper. After supper a big street demon
stration was given. Towns as far away as
Melvornin, 111., and Owensboro, Kv., had
contributed their quota to the crowds and
their delegations to the parade.
General Harrison spoke in Evans' Hall,
the largest auditorium in the city, which
was utterly inadequate. When the thou
sands of people who had witnessed the
parade or part of it surged about the hall
they found it already packed to the doors.
General Harrison was introduced by C. A.
Debruler. In this, the principal speech of
the day, Mr. Harrison addressed himself
chiefly to an argument against cheap
money. After the address the party re
tired to the train and were carried to New
Albany, where the return journey to In
dianapolis will be begun to-morrow.
FORGERY OLD A AND SIMPLE.
Democrats Will Circulate a Spurious Let-
"r Signed McKinley.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Oct. 20.â The. fol
lowing statement was given out to-day at
Republican headquarters:
In these last days of the campaign we may
expect almost any kind of a story published
regarding the past and fuiure lives of the Re
publican candidates for the Presidency and
Vice-Presidency. The most clumsy, base and
contemptible forgery is trial which purports
to be a letter written by Governor McKinley.
This was sent to the National Committee :
â¢ Washington-, D. v, April â , 1890.
Dear General WcUct: Your letter of I importance
begging me to use my influence to secure a pen
sion for Kigpurney, Colonel sl.lowaye, who was a
brave offl> er, as you will say, and for Mrs. Mann,
I can only. say that I decline to do so. and If bills
are introduced I shall do all I can to defeat them.
Ido not believe in era; ting pensions to British
ana Irish hirelings who came here, enlisted and
received Inrse bounties and good ray. ' In the case
of sllloware. though you say f ; be saved President
Lincoln from being ? captured, he received ; his re
ward by promotion, and tie is well able to earn a
living for many years to come. Hoping. you are
well, I remain, yours fraternally, ,;â !Â» â ;
. :, William McKinlxy.
It was pinned to a sheet of paper with the
following unsigned: '
Sir: The above letter is one of many that are in
the posses<io:i oT Colonel William N. Slllowaye of
the New York Bullet. Third avnnue, that I Â«<>t up
In aduwntown office to be sent out next week In
all Democratic papers of the >tato and through
other States in iac-simil<Â» lithographs I send It to
you so you cm ac; accordingly. The old man gels
$' 001) for it, and the letters in bis possession are
such as win turn New York i-tate to j nan, as
well as other >tates. You can, nodoubt.if In time,
counteract and get BiJlowaye to atop their public*
tion. You see it In cold type and can act as you
please.
The committee has declined to purchase it
Hnd take the liberty to publish themselves.
Any one who ever knew Governor McKinley
knows that the letter is stamped from its first
sentence to its last with falsehood. Up to Jan
uary, 1894. he alwayssigned his name William
McKiniey Jr., and wheu his lather died in
that month he dropped the junior from his
name. The Governor's record as a brave sol
dier and his record of standing, in season and
out of season, upon all occasions by those
brave men who gave their services and their
lives to their country, hÂ«s never been ques
tioned or doubted. It is too late to start any
stories now.
FOR MONEST MONEY.
Bishop Seymour Issuer an Open Letter
to Voters.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 20.â Right Rev.
George F. Seymour, Bishop of Quinry
diocese of tbe' Episcopal church, Quincy,
111., has come out with an open letier
urging voters to stand by the cause of hon
est money. The address is on the lines of
Archbishop Ireland's manifesto.
Bishop Seymour has not partic pated in
a political discussion before for thirty
years.
He says he does not believe certain of
the leaders realize what they are doing in
stirring up sectional strife and arraying
the East against the West. He deprecates
the attnek upon the courts, and urges that
every good citizen come to the support of
this bulwark of their liberties.
In discussing the money question he
says it has always been a trick of unscrupu
lous monarchs to rob their subjects by a
debasement of currency, but he aid not
believe our Government would be guillyof
so heinous an offense.
CAMPS ON B RYAN'S TRAIL.
Ex-Connr***inan Maion to Closely Fol
low the Nebraska Orator. .
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 20.â The Illinois
committee of the Republican party de
cided to-day to send ex-Congressman Wil
liam E. Mason of . this city in a special
train after Candidate Bryan, in his final
tour of Illinois, lowa and Nebraska, end
ing at Omaha on the night before election
day, in addition to having Mr. Mason speak
close to t; c Bryan meeting-places in Chi
cago. The plan is for Mr. Mason's train
to follow the Bryan special as close as the
railroad companies will allow for safety,
stop at all the places Mr. Bryan stops, and
if possible speak to the crowds which will
gather to hear the silver nominee. -
A delegation of Republicans from the
Michigan Peninsula called on Chairman
Hanna to assure him that Major McKin
ley would come to the straits with from
10,000 to 15,000 majority.
Mr. Hanna did not like the idea of Sen
ator Jones in adopting the flag appeal for
the same day, but he good naturedly said
he bad the right of way and would stick
to it, although he had received telegrams
suggesting a change of day for the Re
publicans.
CALLERS UP ON McKINLEY.
Assurances .of Hearty Support Come
From All Sections. '
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 20.â Major McKin
ley had no delegations to-day, but he was
not idle by any means. Business
politicians, farmers, laborers, actors,
actresses, lawyers and physicians were

in the morning and spent the rest of the
day in his library. Among his visitors
were J. Madison Vioce of New Orleans,
Charles W. Anderson of New York ana i
Robert H. Tebor of Massachusetts. â¢
Vice-President Stillweli of the Kansas
City and Gulf i Railroad made a speech

eral Alger's special car bearing Generals
Howard, Sickels, Marden Stewart and

dressed an audience of 5000 on the sound
money question. The party will leave for
Lansing to-morrow.
Cockran for McKinley,
CLEVELAND.OHio.Oct. 20.â W. Bourke
Cockran addressed an audience of 8000 peo
ple here this evening. Mr. Cockran pre
dicted the election of McKinley. He re
ferred to Bryan as a Populist, and said he
had no claim on the Democracy. The
country would be ruined if it declared for
free silver, he said. The meeting was
largely composed of iaboring men.
PRINCETON ANNIVERSARY
Celebration of the One Hundred
and Fiftieth Year of the
College.
Faculty, Trustees ani Students Join
in a Procession and Impres
sive Exercises.
PRINCETON, N. J., Oct. 20.â The gr?at
celebration of Princeton's 150'.h anni
versary was opened this morning by a
commemorative religious service in Alex
ander Hall. Long before the time set for
the exercises arrived, the campus was re
splendent with the orange and black, so
dear to the heart of every son of Nassau.
j Groups of undergraduates loitered be
j ncath the old elms and gazed with admir
ation, while the distinguished representa
tives of other institutions, each decorated
in the gay colors of his alma mater, wan
dered here and there about the campus.
At 10:30 interest became centered at
Marquand Cuapel, where the academic
procession, composed of the trustees and
faculty of Princton and the delegates from
other colleges, was forming, preceded by a
j body of the undergraduates, proceeding to
Alexander Hall, where they were received
by the audience rising to their feet. A
choir of alumni opened the exercises by
Ringing the anthem "V- ni Creator Soir

that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
After prayer and singing of the hymn
"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" the
morning's services were closed with the
benediction.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1896.
YELLOW DAZZLES
BRYAN'S EYES
Mistake of the Nebraskan
in Invading McKin
ley's District.
Loyalty to the Standard- Bearer
of Republicanism Very
Visible.
'.WJ-HTY-OHE SPEECHES MADE.
S lv r Advocates Try to Dispel the
Cold Frost in the Buckeye
State-
SAN DUSKY, Ohio, Oct 20.â A sortie
into Major McKinley's old Congressional
district was the most interesting feature
of Candidate Bryan's last day in Ohio,
which ended with a speech at Sandusky
to-night several hours behind the time
called for by the programme. The loyalty
of the Republican candidate's former
Congressional district was manifested at
several places by demonstrations intended
to counteract the enthusiasm for the
Democratic nominee. The manner in
which the supporters of the St. Louis
ticket showed their political feelings was
the same at every place where such dem
onstrations occurred.
At Wellsville, the first town within the
district at which Mr. Bryan spoke, the at
tempt to offset any influence his appear
ance and speech might have was particu
larly marked. YellÂ«>w badges, yellow
neckties, yellow hat-bands, with yellow
streamers tied to brooms and yellow flags,
were numerous. Cheers for McKiuley
were heard frequently and Mr. Bryan's
address was interrupted so often that be
finally turned on his annoyers and ad
dressed some very vigorous remarks in
tended for their benefit. This rallied his
suDporters and they cheered him wich a
heartiness that made him understand his
standard had still plenty followers.
It was the same at East Liverpool,
where gold-hued personal adornment was
practiced to quite as large an extent.
Bellaire and Martins Ferry also furnished
gatherings in which the insignia of the
gold standard was prominently displayed.
The earlier part of Mr. Bryan's trip to-day
brought him to places along the west bank
of the Ohio River. He made a little foray
into Pennsylvania and spoke at Rochester
and New Brighton in that State. Youngs
town gave him his greatest reception, at
least 2500 being in one of the three audi
ences he addresse I these.
His speeches numbered twenty-one and
were delivered at Bellaire, Martins Ferry,
Bridgetown, Steubenville, Toronto, Wells
ville, East Liverpool. Rochester, Pa., New
Brighton, Pa., Youngstown (three), Alli
ance, Ravenna, Kent, Akron (two), Medi
na, Elyria and Sandusky (two).
It was considered silver day in Youngs
town and the city was crowded with vis
itors, who came to hear Mr. Bryan ex
pound the free-coinage doctrine. Several
of the silver ciubs from many places in
Ohio and Western Pennsylvania brought
with them large contingents of excursion
ists ready to do all the cheering necessary
to make the occasion a success. As on
yesterday, the elaborate programmes ar
ranged at some of the places where Mr.
Bryan spoke earlier in the day caused de
lays, wnich made the candidate's -pecial
nearly three hours late in reaching
Youiii-'stown. Mr. Bryan spoke first to an
audience of fully 20,000 in Central square.
Mayor Moore presented him. In this vast
assemblage, a transparency borne by a
silver club from McDonald, Pa., was con
spicuous by its inscription, which said:
"Even the Bishops cannot prevent us from
voting for the poor man's friend."
Mr. Bryan told his audience not to go
into private conversations, but to take his
four years of Congressional life to see if a
single instance could be found where his
vote bad been recorded against the inter
ests of the laboring men. Continuing, he
said :
The Republican candidate for the Presi
dency this year has been in public Hie and :n
public iife he has discussed the mo:;ey
question. At Toledo in this State iv 1891
he denounced tne administration oi Mr.
Cleveland on the grounds thai Mr. Cleveland
had tried to degrade silver to lessen currency,
to make money dear by making it scare?, to
make money the -master of all things instead of
servant. My friei.ds, I repeat to-day what Mr.
McKiniey said five years ago; I repeat to-day
what was true then and I denounce the policy
to-day, while he has turned about and is Â«up
rorting tne financial policy of Urover Cleve
land. [Cheers."] If Mr. Cleveland wn*. wrong
then, then Mr. McKinley Is wrong to-day. It
Mr. Cleve.and was right in 1891 then we are
right to-day in landing by our positiou. My
friends, Ido not mean to say ti,nt n man nr.s
not the right to change his mind. I believe
that a man ought to change his mind when he
finds that he has been wrong, but I believe
that when a man changes his mind he ought
to be able to give reasons for the change. You
tell me that men who were for bimetallism a
few years ago are against it now.
Yc-y, my iriends, that Is true, but there is not
one of them who was for bimetallism a lew
years ago and has changed who has ever been
willing to give the public the reasons lor his
chnnge and carry the public alonn the course
which lea him to his converson. People point
to that distinguished statesman, John G. Car
lisle, und they tell us that Mr. Carlisle has
been converted since 1878.
Senator Morgan Has said that there are two
kinds of converson; there was the conversion
of Paul of Tarsus, who started out to persecute
the Christians, and afterward became an
apostle. Tl ere was the case of Aaron, who
aUo started out as a worshiper of the true
God, and afterward set up & goldeu call.
[Cheers.] The difference between "these two
conversions was that Paul was always glad to
teli of his converson and how he "was con
verted, but Aaron always was ashnied of the
calf business.. [Cheers.]
Mr. Bryan also addressed an audience of
ladies at the opera-house. In replying to
the presentation of a basket of flowers
there, he quoted from the letter read last
Sunday at the Westminster Presbyterian
Church to Detroit, while Mr. Bryan was
present, telling how hard times had af
fected home missionary work and said:
Nothing has stirred my indignation more in
this campaign than that the money-changers
send circulurs to the churches and mission
aries, begging them to stand by the gold stand
ard and heip them to perpetuate a system of
financial bondage.
He added that this question, which was
first a political question and an economic
question, had become a great moral ques
tion as well.
Mr. Bryan also addressed a dense crowd
from his carriage at the Pennsylvania
depot. On the run from Youtigstown Mr.
firyan addressed crowds of 4000 at Alli
ance, 3000 at Ravenna, and 2000 at Kent.
"FRAUD AND TREACHERY."
hiiiior Tiuuning Cries Out Against Mr.
Jiutl-r'* Method:
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 20.â N, A.
Dunning, ex-Populist editor of this city
and leader of the middle-oil the- road {ac
tion, issued to-day an appeal to Populists
of the United States and a defense of Mr.
Wat-on. In part, he says:
The nomination of Mr. Bryan by the Popu
list convention was secured by absolute fraud
nnd treachery. Senator But er weut to St.
Louis as an anti-fusionist and was bought out
right with the position of temporary chair
man. The National ComÂ»nittee has trampleri
Mr. Watson's rights under its feet and made
his candidacy the trading stock tor every
lusiori veal in this campaign. While I an
wri ung this appeal, Cnairmau Butler i 8 sup
pressing the letter of acceptance sent him by
Mr. Watson. The recent manifesto of this com
mittee was intended to br ak ihe force of Mr.
Watson's letter of acceptance and place in a
faise position every ami-fusion Populist in the
party. liwasa deliberate y planned insult
Jiver> act of tnis committee since the conven
tion has been a studied attempt to drive Mr.
Watson from the ticket. While Mr. Watson
has stood loyally by Mr. Bryan, that gentleman
has treated him with supreme contempt. Mr.
Bryau is not r Populist, and could not have
received the nomination of an untrammeled
Populist convention.
Mr. Dunninp adds that he will vote tbe
Republican ticket.
COERCION NOT PERMITTED.
Employes of Corporations Undfr Federa

OMAHA, Nebe., Oct. 20.â The Worid-
Heraid will to-morrow print the following
correspondence, which is self-explanatory:
St. Paul, Minn., October 20.
To the Editor of the Worl !-Herald: I have re
ceived yÂ«ur telegram reading: "lion. Henry
C. Oaldwell, United S"ate_ Circuit Judge, St.
Paul, M.nn.: Will it be necessary for em
ployes of corporations und-r Federal c* urt re
ceiverships to vote for McKinley in order to
hold their p. aces? Would you order investi
gation made of a complaint that a discharge
has been made for political reasons 7
"Omaha World-Hjsbald."
My answer is: It will not be necessary for
employes of corporations under Federal re
ceiverships, over which I have any control, to
vote for McKinley or Bryan, or any other can
didate tor a political office, in order to hoi .,
their places. I wou.d order an investigation
of a complaint that an employe of tbe court
nad been discharged lor political reasons, and
ii ihe compiaint. upon investigation, appeared
to be well founded, I would at once order the
dismissal of every receiver, general manager
or other officer or employe of the court having
anything 10 do with discharging or threaten
ing todischarge employes for po itical reasons.
And it would be sufficient grounds for remov
ing the receiver or general manager if tuey
had reason to balieve that such unlawful co
ercion was being practiced or threatened by
any of thsir subordinate officers or employes
anii took no step to investigate and suppress iv
The loundation stone of the Republic is the
free suffrage of its citizens. It is the constitu
tional right of every legal voter to vote as he
pleases. Any interference with this funda
mental right of the ciMzen by a court would
be a high crime, deserving impeachment, aud
any employe of the court who attempts to co
erce otnor employes of the court to vote other
wise than according to their own judgment
and free choice by threats of discharging them
from the service of the court or by the use of
any other illegal means, would merit and
would receive instant dismissal rom the
service of the court without regard to his rank
or position. Henry C. Caldwell,
United states Circuit Judge, Eighth Judicial
District.
VINDICATION OF FIGHT
Candidate Watson Causing the Bryan
Managers Uuea*iw.ss.
CHICAGO. 111., Oct. 20. â Candidate
Watson will fight Mr. Bryan, the Demo
cratic party and the fusion Populists with
all his might, or he will throw all his per
sonal effort and the support of his follow
ers throughout the country toward the
election of the silver nominee. This im
portant and decisive step will be taken
within the next twenty-four hours. It nil
depends on final negotiations between Mr.
Watson's representatives and C airman
Jones of the Democratic National Com
mittee.
George F. Washburn, the People's party
campaign manager in the West, returned
hurriedly and unexpectedly from Mr.
Watson's home to-night and immediately
asked for a conference with Mr. Jones at
the Auditorium annex. The meeting was
granted, and at 9 o'clock Mr. Wa-hburn,
as tlie accredited personal representative
of Mr. Wiitson, and Senator Jones met in
the latter's room at headquarters. Mr.
Washburn broughtwith him ud ultimatum
in the form of alternative propositions for
submission to the Democratic campaign
committee, and upon the acceptance of
one or other will depend the attitude of
Mr. Watson during the closing days of the
campaign.
Mr. Washburn said that telegrams
would have to pass between him and
Messrs. Reed and Watson before the de
velopments ot the conference could be
made public and nothing would be given
out until to-morrow. Just before going
to the conference Mr. Washburn said to a
reporter i r tne, United Associated Presses :
Mr. Watson would rather be vindicated in
hi* own town, in his owu district, in in* own
State and In the Nation tnan be Vice-Presi
dent. His Southern pride is aroused and the
people of Georgia are rallying around him be
cause he is a Southerner.
The nomination ne received at St. Louis was
forced upon him to unite our forces, and being
at me head of a larger force than that which
elected Lincoln ho demands recognition and
vindicntion or he will fight. I believe that
should Watson issue a thrilling proclamation
to his | arty to line up for Bryan it would be
worth more than tne effort of a thousiind
speaker-!. The danger to-day is the stay-at
home Populists. His pen could bring out the
last man, and now that all oihers have given
up I have undertaken the task of biinging this
about and believe 1 will be successful.
NATIONAL DEMOCRATS
They Sty There Will Soon fie a Rupture
Among l'opoerat*.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 2^.â Colonel Mar
tin of the National Democratic party's
campaign committee, in charge of speak
ers, received a telegram to-day from
Thomas F. Corrigan, chairman of the
Georgia committee, stating that fusion of
the silver Democrats and Populists in that
State would probably not be consummated,
because the Democrats were stubbornly
opposed to giving the Populists any rjlace
on their electoral ticket. Asa consequence
a serious rupture between the parties whs
imminent.
Senator Palmer, who left Chicago yester
day,with Mrs.Palmer, to attend the funeral
of a relative at B*oomington, 111., left the
latter city to-nipht direct to St. Paul,
where he will join General Buckner on
the special and resume the speaking tour
through Minnesota, Nebraska and lowa.
lowa gold Democrats will furnish ex-
Governor Flower oi New York a special
train for his brief tour of that State.
DIES IN A HOPELESS CAUSE.
Suicide of a Labor Leader Who JUad^
Speeches fur Jiryan.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 20.â Robert T.
Swallow, a wrll-known local labor leader,
who has of late been making speeches for
Bryan and Altgeld, wus found dead in the
Cook County Democratic headquarters
this morning.
The discovery was mad" by the janitor
when he opened the rooms. The gas was
turned on full force but not lighted, and
the supposition is that Swallow committed
suicide, though no cause for the act is
known. He was recently elected a member
of the executive committee of the club.
Swallow was a native of Nova Scotia, mar
ried and had lived in this city since 1884.
Raid on the Tollgatei.
FRANKFORT, Ky., Oct. 20.â The toll
gates of Franklin County were raided last

reported to have been destroyed. Three
hundred men were engageu in the depre
dation and they were divided into three
sections, eacn taking a road. Two turn
piKe companies were up in court yesterday
for a failure to keep their roads in order,
and the cases were continued. This prob
ably caused the ouibrenk.

VERY SAD CASE
OF THE CASTLES
Husband and Wife Com
mitted for Trial in
General Sessions.
Request That Old Bailey Be
Substituted Denied by the
Magistrate.
THE SAME HEAVY BONDS STAND
Witnesses Prom America, However,
Wil Be Sent to Show the Mental
Condition of Mrs Castle.
LONDON, Esq., Oct. 20.â Mr. and Mrs.
Walter M. Castle of San Francisco, who
were remanded last Tuesday under a
charge of stealing a number of valuable
furs and various other articles and re
leased upon furnishing baii in the sum of
Â£40,000 for their appearance in court to
day, were again arraigned in the Great
Mar'borough-street' Police Court this
morning and committed for trial at the
Clerkenwell sessions, their case coming
up on November 2. The bail that was
furnished at the last hearing was renewed
and the prisoners were set at liberty pend
ing their trial.
As was the case upon the occasion of
last Tuesday's hearing, the courtroom was
crowded with friends of the accused, curi
osity-seesers, etc. Before the proceedings
were opened Hon. J. Roosevelt, First Sec
retary of the United States embassy, had
an interview with Mr. Castle in an ante
room. Mrs. Castle wore a light-colored
dress. Sbe looked somewhat pale when
Bbc entered the courtroom, but did not
display anything like the nervous agita
tion which sbe so plainly showed at her
last appearance in court.
One of the saleswomen employed in the
establishment of Gustav Ellis, fur-dealer j
of Recent street, was called to the wit- j
ness-stand and testified to the loss by her
employer on October 1 of the sable muff j
which was subsequently found in the
rooms of the prisoners at the Hotel Cecil.
The witness said that on the date men
tioned Mrs. Castle, with her son, came to
Ellis' store and was shown two chinchilla
skins, which she desired to have matched.
Close to where Sirs. Castle stood was a
case containing a sable muff. When, after
a short absence in another part of tbe
pjore, the witness returned to where Mrs.
Castle was awaiting her, the latter made
an excuse for leaving the building, prem
ising to return in a half hour. Shortly
after her departure the muff was missed
from the case â tbe door of tbe case was
not closed, as usual. The next time wit
ness saw the muff was after it had been
removed from the prisoner's rooms to the
police station. Witness positively identi- j
f.ed the muff as the one which was mus
ing from the store alter Mrs. CaÂ«tie'svis t.
Andrew Swertzel, anoiher fni-dealer,
testified to Mrs. Castle visiting his estab
lishment on the last of September. She
came in aione, said the witr.oss, but was
followed in a short time by her son and
husband, each of whom entered the 6tcre
separately.
While Mrs. Castle and the proprietor
were talking with each other, Mr. Castle
looked at some furs at some distance from
where they srood, but Mr. Swertzel would
not say that he touched any of them. Tbe
party soon afterward left the shop, Mrs.
Castle remaining a few minutes after her
husband and son bad gone. Tbe next
day Mrs. Castle called at the store in the
morning and was shown some chinchilia
skins which she wanted to have matcrmd.
She inquired regarding a cape, the price
of which was Â£45, but declined to pay that
amount for it, offering Â£3 less. Her son
came in while she was there and they
departed together.
Witness dia not miss anything at the
time of Mrs. Castle's visit and did not
know he had Deen robbed until he identi
fied some of the articles taken from the
rooms in the hotel in which the prisoners
lived. The articles were in that part of
the showroom in v:hich Mr. Castle stood
upon the occasion of Mrs. Castle's first
visit to his establishment.
Other furriers identified tbe property
found in the possession of the prisoners
as belonging to them, and a plated toast
rack and cream jug bearine the stamp
"Hotel Cecil" were identified by the
manager of tbat hotel.
After the circumstances attending the
arrest of the prisoners had been testified
to by detectives the prosecution rested.
Magistrate Newton then committed the
prisoners for trial at the Clerkenwell
sessions.
Charles Matthews, counsel for tbe de
fense, asked that the defendants be com
mitted for trial in the Central Criminal
Court, Oid Bailey, instead of the ordinary
sessions. His grounds for making this
request, he said, were that the anxiety of
the friends of Mr. and Mrs. Castle in San
Francisco that tbey should receive the
benefit of all available testimony in their
favor was very great, and the committal
of the prisoners for trial in the Old Bailey
Court would allow them to come to Eng
land, bringing with them medical evi
dence of the mental Irresponsibility of
Mrs. Castle.
Magistrate Newton said that he was un
able to comply with the request as he was
acting under directions to send all cases
of shop-lifting to the sessions.
Mr. Matthews then said he hadnodoubt
that he would be able to obtain an ad
journment of the case from the Clerken
well Sessions Court in order to enable
witnesses from America to be present at
tbe trial.
The prisoners pleaded not guilty and re
served their line of defense.
TO ARBITRATE A LOVE AFFAIR.
Queen Victoria Will Decide That Prince
Alfred Must Marry the Homely
Relative With Money.
LONDON, Eva., Oct. 20.â The story is
the round of the clubs that Queen
Victoria will shortly be called in as arbi
tiatorto settle tbe love affairs of one of
her grandchildren, Prince Alfred, son of
the Duke of Edinburgh, the present ruler
of Saze-Cbburg-Gotha.
The Prince, who is approaching his
twenty-third year, some time ago formed
an attachment for the Princess Fedora of
Meiningen, a young woman of fine looks
and considerable attainments.
His mother, however, who was at the
time of her marriage the Grand Duchess
Marie of Russia, has decided that he shall
marry the Princess Vera of Wurtemberg,
one of her own blood relations and whose
lack of beauty and unsociable demeanor
are counterbalanced by the fact that she
is an heiress in her own right.
According to the current report, how
ever. Prince Alfred has set his foot down
and declared tbat it is to be the Princess
Fedora or nobody, and so, in accordance
with the rule and practice tbat prevails
in the royal family, the matter of the
heart is to be submitted to the Queen for
her adjudication.
Those familiar with her rulings in other
cases are willing to give odds that she
will decide in favor of the blood relation.
CHANGED WILLIAM'S LANGUAGE.
So Two Newspaper Correspondents at the
Meeting of Kaiser and Czar
Have Been Arrested.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 20. â Two
newspaper correspondents. Herr Leckert
and Baron yon Lutzow, who attended the
meetingof Emperor William and the Czar at
Breslau, have been arrested on the charge
of libelously insulting Count yon Eulen
berg, grand marshal of the court and
grand master of ceremonies. The trouble
arose from a chance remark that was
made in the reply of the Czar to the toast
to him made by Emperor William. In
the earliest version of the reply it was
stated that the Czar had avowed that he
was "inspired by the same traditional
sentiment as my father." A later version
changed the wording to "J Â«m inspired by
the same traditional sentiments as your
Majesty." Herr Leckert and Baron yon
Lnizow ascribed the alteration to Count
yon Eulenburg, who saw in tbe asoription
a veiled political attack, and caused the
arrest of the correspondents. It is stated
that one of the men has been released.

TOOK LIFE IN SAN JOSE
Outlaw Downen's Confession
Clears a Mystery of Long
Standing.
His Victim of 1885 Believed at the
Time to Have Committed
Suicide.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 20.â The confes
sion of Albert H. Downen, the lone
highwayman in jail in Denver, to havine
committed a murder in St. James Park in
this city in 1385, has brought to light a
murder which had been regarded as a nul
cide.
On Juno 8, 1885, the body of a man, after
ward identified as Henry Braun of San
Francisco, was found lying face downward
in a path in St. James Park, near the Sec
ond-street entrance, with a builet-hole in
his left temple. The man was a German,
heavy set and about 40 years of age. He
had the appearance of one well to do.
There were no signs of a struggle, and a
few feet away lay a 38-caliber revolver
with one chamber empty. Near by, on
the ground, was picked ud a note written
in lead pencil saying that the writer was
tired of life and had decided to kill him

At the inquest the next day it developed
that the man had stopped at the Pacific
H itel for several days, having registered
as H. Braun. H* was of a taciturn and
quiet demeanor and had little to say to
the guests aoout the hotel. A search of
his room revealed a purse containing
$3 50 and a silver watch. A letter from
James Willey of San Francisco was read
at the inquest, saying Henry Braun had
lately come from Tacoraa, and tbat he
was possessed of considerable money and
an onen-faced gold watch. The writer
said Braun was looking about to purchase
a saloon. The Coroner's jury returned a
verdict of suicide. \

Supreme Court Hands Down a
Decision Sustaining His
Position.
RIGHTS OF THE SUPERVISOR!
The Board Held to Be a Municipi
Body Within the Meaning
of the Statutes.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 20.â The Su
preme Court handed down a decision here
to-day in the case of Charles 8. Young,
appellant, against Madison Babcock, re
spondent, an appeal from hnal judgment
in favor of the defendant upon sustaining
a demurrer to the complaint of therelator.
The chief points in the decision are epi
tomized thus:
Andrew J. Moulder, the duly elected, quail
fied and acting Superintendent of Schools for
the City and County of San Franchco, died on
the 14th day of October, 1895, whereby
the office became vacant. On November 4,
1895, the piaintiff, Charles & Young, was by
the Board of Supervisors appointed to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Moulder. The
said Charles a Young thereupon qualified,
took the oath of office and filed his bond as
such Scnool Superintendent. Defendant Bab
cock claims to be the Superintendent in and
for the City and County of Sail Francisco, and
since November 4, 1895, has usurped and in
truded himself into said office to the exclusion
ol the said Charles S. Youug, who, on Novem
ber 21, 1895. demanded to be let into posses
sion of said office, which was refused by Bab
cock. Plaintiff demands judgment.
Firstâ That defendant Babcock is not enti
tled to the said office and that he be excluded
therefrom.
Secondâ That Charles S. Young is entitled to
said ofli c and that he be admitted to the pos
session and enjoyment thereof.
The sole question in this appeal ia as to the
authority of the Board of Supervisors of the
City and County of San Francisco to appoint a
Superintendent of Schools of said City and
County to fill the vacancy caused by the death
of Andrew J. Moulder. The act of April, 1806,
usually known as the "consolidation act," pro
vides for the election in the City and County
of Sao Francisco of a Board of Supervisors,
composed of twelve members; of a Board of
Education, composed oi twelve members;
many other officers and a Superintendent ol
Common Schools. Section 31 of the act pro
vides:
"In case of a vacancy in the office of School
Superintendent the Board of Education may
assemble and appoint a person ;o fill the va
cancy until the regular election next Joliow
ing."
Section 9 of an act to authorize the Board of
Supervisors of the City and County of San
FrancUco to fill vacancies which might occur
in i he elective offices of said City and County
when no other provision was made bylaw to
hil the same. This last provision had no ap
plication to the vacancy in the office of Super
intendent of Schools, for the reason that other
provisious was made there/or.
In 1663 an act was pa-sed amending the law
in referrence to the Board of Education of the
City and County of San Francisco, but retain
ing the provision for filling vacancies in the
office ot School Superintendent by the Board of
.Education. The power thus conferred upon
the Board of Education by ihe "consolidation
act" and the amendments thereto, which con
stitute the charter of the City and County of
San Francisco, is still vested in that body,
unless wrested from it by the act of March 14,
1883, entitled "an act to establish a unilorm
sysum of county and township governments,"
or by several county government acts since
passed. Have they? Bection 1, article XI, of
tne constitution of 1879 provides that "the
several counties as they now exist are hereby
declared a legal subdivision of this State."
Section 2, article IX, is es follows :
"A Superintendent of Schools for each
county bhall be elected by the qualified elec
tors thereof at each general election, provided
that the Legislature may authorize two or
more counties to unite and elect one Superin
tendent of the counties so unitinf."
This section m> kes the Superintendent of
Schools a county officer. Under the consolida
tion act and the various amendments there
exited, prior to the adoption of our codes, in
the City and County oi San Francisco a Super
iutendent of Schools. Subdivision 21 of sec
tion 25 of the act of 1885 provides "that the
Board of Supervisors in the several counties
shall have the power to fill by appointment
all vacancies that may occur In any office filled
by appointment of said board and elective
county or township offices, except in those of
Judge of the Superior Court and Supervisors;
the appointee to hold office for the unexpired
The question of the status, power, duties and
duration oi the terms of office ot the several
officers of the City and County of San Francisco
has recently been considered in the case of
Juliuu Kahn vs. Adolpb Sutro et al.
Conclusions: ban Francisco is both city and
county. Some of its officers are city officers
and others are county officers. So far as the Su
pervisors are concerned the members of the
court are united in the opinion that they are
municipal officers and not county officers
within the purview of the county government
act. We are of opinion that the power to fill
vacancies given to Boards of Supervisors by
the county government act applies to the
Board of Supervisors in and for the several
counties of the State other than the City and
CouDty of San Francisco; and that as to the
latter the power 'o fill vacancies in office
comes from the "consolidation act" and does
not include vacancies iv the office of Superin
tendent of Public Schools, which are filled by
the Board of Education. It follows that the
judgment appealed from, should be affirmed,
aud we so recommend.

NEW TO-DAY : '
ANOTHER GREAT TRIUMPH
FOR
DOCTOR SWEANY.
THROUGH A SERIES OF WONDERFUL EXPERIMENTS JUST
COMPLETED BY HIM WITH THE
DOCTOR WEANY HAS DISCOVER ED THE CAUSE OF AND CURE FOR
\ MANY DISEASES. ;
i Every one has heard of the wonderful discovery which,
was given to the public the early part of this year by Pro-
fessor Roentgen. Newspapers as well as scientific and
medical journals throughout the world have been filled
with reports of the marvels accomplished by this great
scientific discovery. As soon as the medical world be-
came convinced of its genuineness all manner of specula-
tion was indulged in as to the extent and limit the X ray
could be utilized in the diagnosis of diseases of the vari-
ous organs of the body. : â¢ -.' â ;â  :-'
The American Journal of Science for March, .1896, in
an article on the subject, ventured this prediction: _*.â  :
"That the cathode rays are destined to give us a far
deeper insight into nature nobody can doubt.
i This prediction, as well as all others of like import,
has been more than fulfilled, and the end is not yet.
Almost since the introduction of the X rays experi-
ments without number ; have been made by medical men
throughout the world, and the result of these experiments
has been not alone interesting, but has proven a great
boon arid blessing to suffering humanity. 'i rv , ;
Among ; the latest and most astonishing discoveries of
the wonderful powers of the X ray are those just com-
pleted by the far-famed specialist, DOCTOR SWEANY.
This gentleman, who ;, is I.;1 '.; always abreast of the foremost
men in his profession, recently installed in his office one
of the latest X-ray machines ever constructed in the
world. He then commenced a series of experiments, that
have resulted in I . a;- success ; entirely beyond his most ex-
travagant expectations, and which entirely eclipse in im-
portance any discoveries hitherto made in the medical world
The history of these discoveries, while interesting in
the extreme, is far too lengthy to relate in detail. It is
sufficient to state that he has succeeded in diagnosing
with the utmost accuracy the cause of a great many
diseases with which the human family is; afflicted.
Among the ailments to which DOCTOR SWEANY
especially directed his studies and experiments with the
X rays are those which come under the head of his spe-
cialties, particularly Diseases of the Nervous System,
also Diseases of the Kidneys, Bladder, Liver, Heart,
Stomach, and in fact diseases of all the vital and internal
organs of the body. . v.
; This great specialist, from the great knowledge thus
derived from his experiments, is able to treat with the
utmost accuracy all diseases of men and women and to
effect cures in cases that were in many instances hitherto
regarded as incurable. That DOCTOR SWEANY'S
already great reputation and success will be enhanced a
thousand fold no one can doubt who is familiar with the
splendid record he has achieved during the ten years past
that he has been engaged in the practice of ; his profession
in San Francisco. ; All his patients will not alone receive
the benefit of this newly acquired knowledge on the part
of ; DOCTOR SWEANY, but they can also receive at his
office most thorough examinations by means of his X-ray
apparatus. . .;
.TO OTHESR DOCTORS
7? nave patients whose diseases are puzzling and where the nature of the trouble is
lot fully known DOCTOR SWEANY extends a cordial invitation to avail themselves
". th Â® a i vantages of his 'experiments and of the X-ray apparatus with which
us office is now equipped j for the perfect diagnosing lof any disease. As a perfect
diagnosis of any.disease is an absolute necessity before the correct treatment can hÂ«
tdvised, DOCTOR SWEANY is pleased to be 01 any possible assistance that will aid
us fellow-physicians in the treatment of their patients. - Â«"Â»aia

THORNS IN LOVE'S PATHWAY.

Home Provided by the Aged
Spcuse
FRESNO, Cal., Oct. 20.â 8. B. Bresee, a
well-known pioneer resident of Fresno
and at one time wealthy, has just under
gone a marital venture which has made
him a much wiser man. It was a brief
but romantic venture, and the old man
has reason to carry a heavy heart. He is
60 years of age, and this was his second
unsuccessful attempt since his first wife
died.
Some time ago Mr. Bresee chanced to
run across a paper which contained a num
ber of "matrimonial ads." One of these
set forth that, a "charming widow of
means," residing in Los Angeles, was de
sirous of taking unto herself a husband.
Mr. Bresee was weary of single life and he
was looking for a wife. The Los Angeles
"widow of means" caught his fancy. The
noDle sentiment was stirred up within the
oft-stormed breast and he decided to woo
once more. Besides, Mr. Bresee had a
$5000 morteage on bis home in this city,
and by winning the Los Angeles "widow
of means" he thought that she would save
it for him.
Accordingly he entered into a corre
spondence with the Loa Anaeles lady.
His letters had great effect upon the
lonely widow, and the correspondence
immediately assumed a most affectionate
tone. Presently Mr. Bresee proposed by
mail, and he was accepted by mail. He
expeditiously repaired to Los Angeles.
The two (overs met for the first time, and
on Saturday, October 10, they were wedded.
After a short but extremely blissful
honeymoon Mr. and Mrs. Bresee came to
Fresno, intending to make their home
here for the remainder of their lives. The
bride seemed highly pleaded when she
first arrivpd and the groom was equally
h^ppy. Though hardly prepossessing she
was satisfactory to Mr. Bresee, according
to his own statements, and he proudly
introduced his wife to his friends during
the afternoon of the day they arrived.
At evening the fair bride expressed a
desire to visit tne business quarter of the
city. She came uptown alone and never
returned to the Bresee home. She pur
chased a ticket for Los Angles and on the
following day reached that city.
Just why Mrs. Bresee loft her husband
in such a summary manner is not known
here, as she spoke to no one about it be
fore she departed. It is believed, how
ever, that her expectations of what her
Fresno home wonld b- were by no means
realized. The house Is located just north
of the Chinese quarter.
Mr. Bresee is disconsolate. He thinks
he has made a fool of himself, but says
he still loves ti:e widow and may try to in
dnce her to return to him. Afewypars
ago Mr. 3resee married a girl 18 years of
age. She had thought he was wealthy,
Dut when she learned to the contrary she
left him. He then secured a divorce.

that he can give no good description of
them.
TROUBLE IN STANISLAUS.
Method of a Canal Company to Enforce
Payment of Its Rates for
Water.
MODESTO, Cal., Oct. 20.â Farmers and
stock-raisers of the west side of the San
Jonquin River, in this county, are con
fronted by what mny terminate in a start
ling condition of affairs. The canal of the
San Joaquin and King Rivers Canal Com
pany, oftener called the Miller & Lux
canal, supplied residents of that portion
of the county with water for irrigation
and stock-raising purposes. Deeming the
rates charged too high the water-Ã¼bers
applied to the company tor a reduction.
It refused, and they then petitioned the
Board of Supervisors to establish rates for
the corporation.
This move was bitterly fought, but in
June the BoarJ of Supervisors established
a schedule of rates, reducing the former
prices from an average of $2 50 per acre to
$1 50. Now a Deputy United States
Marshal is in the county subpenaing all
Supervisors to appear before the United
States Circuit Court in San Francisco on
November 2 to answer to proceedings in
an equity suit commenced against them
by the canal company.
The most serious phase for the stock
raisers at present is that there is no water
flowing in the canal and has not been for
some time. Several weeks ago the canal
company's agent informed the patrons
that the water would be turned off foj^ ten
days or two weeks. The time expired, and
no water came. The agent again said it
would be ten days or two weeks more
before it would flow, but the alfalfa fields
are suffering, as this is the time of the year
w en the ranchers flood their lands. Stock
is also on short rations.
SANTA BARBARA'S SENSATION.
Supreme Court Asked to Disbar Attorney
Grant Jackson From Practicing
in the State.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 20.-C. A.
Storke of Santa Barbara to-day filed a peti
tion in the Supreme Court of this State
asking for the disbarment from practice of
Grant Jackson, an attorney of this place.
This action is based upon an alleged false
bill of exceptions filed by Jackson some
months ago in asking fora new trial in the
divorce suit of Storke vs. Storke, This
case was one in which cross-complaints
bad been filed by each party. After a full
and exhaustive hearing a decision had
been rendered in Mr. Storke's favor. â 
Jackson was counsel for Yda Addis
Storke, the defendant, who ij possessed of
a some-time celebrity as a writer, and in
appealing for a new trial he presented an
elaborate resume of the testimony claimed
to have been presented on the former hear
ing, which had not been written out by the
court reporter. This quotation of testi
mony, it is stated, is grossly false and will
fully perverted in behalf of the accused
attorney's client, the testimony of respect
able witnesses being maliciously distorted
and expanded, and the attorney's disbar
ment from practice is therefore asked under
the provisions of the code.
SAID ON A HORSECAR

U>B ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 20.â Two

driver, was shot in the arm and cheek.
Reyes was engaged in fixing his lamp
when the highwaymen sprang from De
hind a lumber pile and thrust a revolver
toward his face. He threw up his left
arm and called for help. The revolver
was discharged, the ball passing through
Reyes' forearm and lodging in his cheek.
The negroes then ran away without at
tempting to secure any money. Keyes is
not dangerously hurt.

COLLISION AT A

Persons Struck by a
Train.
The Vehicle Wrecked and Its
Occupants Dashed to the
Ground.
SUSTAIN SERIOUS INJURIES.
Miss E sic Doud ot San Francisco
Loses a Foot Under the
Wheels.
NAPA, Cal., Oct 20.â A carriage con
taining Miss Essie Doud of Howard street,
San Francisco, Mrs. Dr. Fluno of Oak
land, Mrs. N. F. Whipple of Napa, six
year-old Lina Whipple and Walter Whip
ple, the latter of whom was driving, was
struck by a passenger train at the Jhird
street railioad crossing tins afternoon.
The carriage was wrecked aud all were
thrown to the ground. Miss Doud's left
foot was so badly crushed that it had to
be amputated. Mrs. Fluno was struck on
the head by a drivewheel of the engine
and badly injured. It is feared her in
juries may prove fatal. Little Lina Whip
pie was badly bruised about the face.
Mrs. Fluno and Miss Doud had been
visiting at the home of N. F. Whipple,
who lives about a mile and a half from
Napa. The surrey was hitched up to
bring them to the afternoon train, as they
wished to return to their home. The
horses were driven leisurely along, no
danger being apprehended by the merry
people. The afternoon train from Cal
istoga was coming down the track. It is
perhaps not strange that the train was not
seen, for the Columbia Hotel and an
empty passenger coacu so obstructed the
view that an approaching train could not
be seen until one was close to the track.
The horses and the fore part of the rig
bad crossed the track when the vehicle
was struck by the cowcatcher. The surrey
was thrown into the air. The occupants
were pitched to the ground. The train
was stopped before it had gone thirty feet
further and the trainmen hastened to the
assistance of the injured. The surrey had
been carried and thrown about twenty
feet down the track.
Mrs. Fluno was lying on the ground un
conscious, her head close to the drive
wheel of the engine. Her face was cov
ered with blooo. Miss Doud was a few
feet away. Lina was badly bruiser! about
the head and required assistance.
No blame can be attached to the railroad
officials, as the proper signals were given
and the train was coming very slowly.

Johnson, a prime mover and enthusiastic
worker in } the settlement and ; . improve
ment of Pacific Grove t and , a . large prop
erty-owner of this place, died yesterday
of appendicitis at ".. Medford, ; Oregon. V" A
telegram last night announced the fact to
his sorrowing friends here.
The connection' which . Johnson ; had
"with the early history of Pacific : Grove is
of so important a nature that ; bad \ there

doubtful if there would have been a Paci

his efforts until the day of his death the
advancement and prosperity of ; the town
were subjects in which his interest never
flagged. â / â  / V â¢ ; :
J. O. Johnson was the son of a Southern
planter, and was born in Rappahannook
County, Virginia, May 10, 1844. In 1869
the family moved to California and settled
in Monterey County. In 1877 J. O. John
son came to Pacific Grove, which, though
founded in 1875, was even then little more
than a camping ground, and at a cost of
$10,000 he built and equipped .a . livery
stable.
: He also engaged in other ventures and
from : 1878 >to ? 1880 : was superintendent of
the Grove, under David Jacks' orders, for
the Pacific Grove Retreat Association. In
1880 the Puente del Pinos ranch, compris
ing the present site of Pacific Grove, was
sold by David Jacks to the '. Pacific Im
provement Company at $5 per acre, and
Johnson was installed in 1881 as superin
tendent under the new ownership, his old
office with the Retreat Association being
filled by Rev. Dr. Binex, now incumbent.
While holding office with ' ; the Pacific Im
provement Company Johnson platted the
township of Pacific Grove and soon after
ward Â« . sold over ;; 3000 : lots, ': which were
speedily built upon. The improvement
of streets and driveways was also carried
far during his superintendency. In 1886
Johnson resigned and was succeeded by
B. A. Eardley. who still holds the position.
Johnson married % a daughter of mD. W.
Lloyd, the pioneer grocer of Pacific Grove.

SAYS MATRIMONY IS DEGRADED.
Bishop Dart of British Columbia Assails
the United States Divorce
Laws.
VANCOUVER, B. O, Oct. 2a âThis is
what Bishop Dart of British Columbia
says about matrimony in the United States
in his pastoral address to the British Col
umbia Anglican Synod:
"It is well known that lax ideas respect
ing marriage are abroad, and it is well
known that in some of the United States
God's holy ordinance of matrimony has
been degraded through the facilities of
fered for divorce into a temporary legal
ized concubinage, dissoluble almost at the
will of either party. Members of our own
communion are .not the only Christian
people who feel that this is an abominable
state of things. But lax ideas are apt to
spread terribly fast and unless we plainly
and earnestly declare God's law our peo
ple will too readily conform to a lower
standard. We should teach oftener than
we commonly do tne sanctity and perma
nence of the marriage tie, and the impera
tive obligation to the family as the di
vinely appointed end of marriage. We
should point out that laxity with regard
to the marriage bond has invariably ac
companied the decay and decadence of
nations.

points to a striking illustration of this
truth. He says: 'In the later republic
the frequency of divorce was, at once, the
sign, the cause, and the consequence of
the rapid degradation of morals. There
can be no doubt that this dissolution of
those bonds which unite the family was
thecorrodine plague of Roman society.'
The greatest of living Englishmenâstates
men, philos pher, theologian (referring
doubtless to W. E. Gladstone) has lately
told us that fifty years ago he had read
everything he coulJ find upon the subject,
and that nothing since had shaken the
conclusion be had then arrived at on the
absolute perpetuity of the marriage tie,
save when it was broken by death."
As a large proportion of the residents
of British Columbia are either farmer resi
dents of the United States or citizens of
that republic, considerable indignation is
expressed at the Bishop's strictures on the
marriage laws of the United States.
PORTLAND'S GOOD SAMARITAN.
Aid Cornea to a Distressed Immigrant
Who Could Not Pay for His
: Wife's Burial.
PORTLAND, Ob., Oct. 20.â William
Ashton, a man about 50 years old, arrived
at the Union depot this mornine from
Kansas, accompanied by six motherless
children, the eldest not more than 10 years
of age. Ashton left bis home ten days
ago on an emigrant train bound for Yam
hill County, where he has friends, for the
benefit of his wife' 3 health. In order to
pay tne passage of his family this man
sacrificed the little property he had in
Kansas.
On the third day out Mrs. Ashton died
aboard of ihe train from a hemorrhage of
the stomach, and she was buried along the
road in an impromptu coffin, Ashton in
tending to have the body exhumed as soon
as he was able and give it a Christian
burial. When he landed here this morn
ing he had but $6 left, a part of which he
expended in telegraphing his condition to
his Yamhill County friends.
While the afflicted emigrant was unfold
ing his sad story to a patrolman an old
gentleman accompanied by a young lady,
both wearing mourning attire, were intent
listeners. When Ashton had concluded
his story the old gentleman, with tears
glistening In his eyes, walked up to him
and took the sorrowing emigrant by the
hand, saying:
"My dear man, you haye my sympathy,
I recently lost one just as dear to me as it
seems your wife was to you. Take this
and satisfy your heart's desire to give your
dead wife a Christian burial."
The strange old gentleman took from a
wallet a $50 bank note and pressed it into
Ashton's hand.
"Will you please give me your name
and address?" gasped Ashton, with much
emotion and gratitude.
"Never mind, but may God bless you
and your little brood," replied the benevo
lent old gentleman. And without the ex
change of another word the good samari
tan and his charge entered the waiting
room of the Union depot.

Election November 3, J896.
If business trusts Bryan, Bryan will bust
business.
The campaign is sorely a good thingâ
push it alone
The campaign will soon be over. Do
your work now and do it well.
There is nothing revolutionary about
Wheat. It always rises for prosperity.
Bryan is condemned by his own oratory.
The appeal to revolution is a roorback.
That grand old veteran "General En
thusiasm" was at the Boutelle meeting
last night. _
It is not the voice of the partisan but
the voice of patriotism that the people
listen to this year.
The rise in the price of wheat that upset
the Bryanites has elevated the hopes of
the friends of prosperity.
That campaign canard has not come out
yet, but keep watching for it. Eternal
vigilance is the way to head it off.
The most fitting symbols of the Popo
crat fusion are the torch of Altgeld borne
aloft on the pitchfork of Tillman.
The National flag is a fit emblem of a
National party, but what have section
alists and class parties to do with it?
The way to get straight men in office is
to stick to straight politics. Don't trust
connubiators at any turn in tbe road.
The Populists swear they were not swal
lowed by Buckley, but they will never
know the truth until after election day.
The Republican party, which saved the
Nation, has a right to fly the banner of
the Nation, no matter how the Popocrats
howL .
By the time the Bryanites are through
with tne campaign they will have learned
tnat fr^e riot is no more popular than free
trade.
The party of deficits and disasters has
become the party of repudiation and revo
lution. It is easy for a man to go down
hill when he gets started.
The Republican party is the best friend
of the American silver industry, as it is
the only party that promises to help it in
the markets of the world.
As all the evidences of tbe time point to
the conclusion that international bimet
allism Is a sure winner, why should we
run the risk of tbe other thing?
No man can accurately calculate his loss
by the Democratic depression, but every
man knows be has lost too much to afford
another experiment of the kind.
If the Non-Partisans had taken tne ad
vice of The Call and abstained .from
nominating candidates for the Legislature
they would have been wiser then and hap
pier now.
Under the same monetary system v?e
have now we had prosperity while the
McKinley tariff was in force, and we will
have that prosperity again when a similar
tariff is enacted.
The course of tbe campaign has demon
strated ttfat tbe brains of the Bryan move
ment are carried under the hat of Altgeld,
bat they are the brains of an agitator and
not of a statesman.
"How about the tariff?" is a question
that made the Democrat feel sick in the
beginning of the campaign, but not so
sick as he feels now when yon ask him
"How about wheat?"
It is the duty of good citizens to see to
it that free-traders shall no longer disturb
industry, free-silverites shall no longer
disturb finance and free-rioters shall not
disturb the peace of the country.
If now the Republicans of San Francisco
will assert themselves and act with unity
they can carry the City by a majority that
-will make the State sure for McKinley and
Hobart. Why should they not do it?
In appealing to prejudice and ignorance
the Bryanites have alienated the con
science, the patriotism and the intelli
gence of the people to such an extent that
even the extremest free eilverites hesitate
any longer to make a common cause with
them.
After reading the bitter and envious
words of Bryan appealing to sectionalism
and class hatred it is comforting to tnrn
to those noble words of McKinley, "The
inspiring and unconquerable sentiment of
this campaign is country first, country
last, and country with sUiulesa honor all
lbÂ« time."
THE COERCION SCARE.
The manifesto of Chairman Jones issued
yesterday on behalf of the Democratic
! National Committee, addressed to "The
American People," warning th<;m of a
widespread conspiracy alleged to exist
among employers of labor for the coercion
of voters at the coming election, may be
taken to indicate what the Democratic
method will be during the remaining two
weeks of the campaign.
Argument has already been abandoned,
reason has been caet to the winds, and in
their place there has been adopted a wild,
unreasoning and untruthful howl of co
ercion. The American voter is to be told
in all tte notes of two octaves that he and
his neighbor is the slave of the employer
of each and that upon election day he is
to be forced to vote for a candidate and a
platform which he detests or take the
alternative of losing his job.
From the heart of every true and loyal
American citizen should arise a cry of
"Shame" upon such disgraceful and dis
creditable campaign tactics as these. The
managers of the Democratic National cam
paign know very well that there is nothing
in the cry of coercion which they have
adopted as the last desperate expedient by
which to inflame the minds and subvert
the Totes of the laboring people of the
land.
The very indefiniteness of Chairman
Jones' manifesto is the best evidence that
it has no foundation in fact. (Every voter
within the State of California, for exam
ple, who is fortunate enough to have
steady employment, knows that he is not
being coerced by his employer, whether
that employer be a corporation or an indi
vidual. It is only necessary for men of
intelligence to consider the facts within
their own horizon in order to be assured
of the folly and falsity of Chairman Jones,
assertion.
It is safe to say that not a single
authentic instance of coercion or intimi
dation will be discovered by the Demo
cratic National Committee or by any one
else. This fact, however, will not prevent
the orators and campaign managers of the
Democratic party from uttering and re
echoing the cry of coercion during the re
mainder of the campaign. The good
sense of the laboring men of the country
may be safely relied upon, however, not
to be misled or deceived thereby. They
fully realize that their employers and
themselves are united in a common in
terest, and that the mutual advantage of
each depends upon a return of that pros
perity which the country had before it
entered upon the present epoch of Demo
cratic misrule.
If tbeir votes, therefore, are cast in ac
cordance with their employers' desires, it
will be not because of any coercion, bat
rather because every employe understands
that his own interests and his employers'
interests are identical, and that the Re
publican party is pledged to financial and
commercial policies which will advance
the mutual interests of each.
The inspiring and unconquerable sen
timent of this campaign is country first,
country last and country with stainless
honor all the time. The voice of mia
guided partisans is not heeded ; the
voice of patriotism strikes a responsive
chord this year. The voice of prejudice
and hate is lost in the grand chorus of
peace and good will, National unity and
National integrity.â McKinley.
BOUTELLE'S ADDRESS.
If anything had been needed to confirm
Republicans and all conservative citizens*
in the support of McKinley and Hobart
the confirmation would have been found
in the earnest and eloquent address of
Mr. Boutelle last evening. Those who
did not hear it should carefully read the
report of it, which we publish this morn
ing. Even though the printed extracts of
the speech lack the ardor infused into the
spoken words by the tone and the presence
of the orator, and though the enthusiasm
of the great audience is absent from the
reader, nevertheless the arguments of
themselves have weight, and the glowing
sentences will arouse the mind to the
greatness of the issues before us.
The coming of so distinguished a states
man as Mr. Boutelle to take part in the
California campaign has been a great
stimulus to Republican ardor. It has
made it certain that the influence of Cali
fornia in National affairs is recognized in
the East and that the Republican leaders
of that section in their broad National pa
triotism and policy do not overlook this
far-off titate on the Western shores of the
continent. They have sent to us one of
the ablest and most eloquent of the great
statesmen of the party to help us in this
contest for prosperity, for good govern
ment and for National honor.
The audience which assembled to hear
Mr. Boutelle was in every way worthy of
the orator and of the occasion. While
some may have gone to the hall out of
curiosity to see and hear so eminent a
representative of our public men the great
majority were there because of a profound
interest in the issues of the day and an
earnest desire to hear them discussed by
one so well fitted to do it. The speech
was a masterly presentation of the condi
tion of the country and the remedy for
existing evils. The contrast between the
conservative elements of society that are
supporting McKinley and those which
controlled the Chicago convention and are
now supporting Bryan was forcibly drawn.
It was just the speech we needed at this
juncture. It will rouso the Republicans of
San Francisco to new efforts and send
them to the work of the closing weeks of
the campaign with a resistless vim and
vigor. _______________
In times of commercial disturbance,
financial difficulty and industrial dis
tress, the financial theorist and experi
mentalist has his opportunity; but be
never proposes, and never hag, on these
occasions, but one remedy, and that is

so-called money, and so make money
cheap. In every instance, in the -whole
history of the world, where money has
been debased, the standard of money
destroyed and the currency cheapened,
it has rained the nation, destroyed
business and reduced populations to
poverty, despair and starvation. â

THE NON-PARTISAN PLEDGE.
The action of oartain Democratic candi
dates in repudiation of the Non-Partisan
pledge to support the new charter in case
its ratification should come before the
Legislature exposed the folly of requiring
such a pledge. While the tardiness of the
repudiators in publishing their refusal to
be bound by the pledge until it was too
late for the Non-Partisans to withdraw
tbeir indorsement is not creditable to
them, the fact remains that their position
with reference to the subject is logically
correct.
It is a fact which admits of no dispute
that a member of the Legislature is the
creature and servant of his constituency
and is "bound in his official action to fol
low the dictation of his district whenever
it is expressed in any formal way. The
members of the next Senate and Assem
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1896.
bly from San Francisco will be bonnd by
this rule and ought not to be asked to de
part from it by anybody who is uot au
thorized to speak for the Assembly or
Senatorial district from which each mem
ber comes.
The Non- Partisan Convention was in no
sense of the term a representative of the
Senate and Assembly districts of San Fran-
Cisco or of the voters which belong in
each, nor had it any authority to bind a
member of eitner house of the Legislature
to support any measure against the wishes
of the voters who elected him. Upon the
question of the adoption or rejection of
the new charter the electors of each legis
lative district are as supreme in tbeir right
of dictation to their representative as they
are upon any other subject. It follows
that the action of the Non-Partisan Con
vention in attempting to bind certain can
didates for the Legislature todo something
which their constituents might not ap
prove was a mistake, and that the pledge
which it has exacted is, as it should be, a
Tain and useless thing.
When the day of election arrives the
voters of each Senatorial and Assembly
district will pass judgment upon the
merits or demerits of the proposed charter,
and by so doing will instruct the legislators
whom they may elect how to vole upon
the same subject in the event of the charter
receiving enough votes to entitle it to go
before the Legislature. The proper con
struction of the Non-Partisan pledge
should therefore be taken to amount to
nothing more than this, that the success
ful candidates for the Legislature will,
when at Sacramento, vote for or against
the charter as the constituents of each of
them voted here.
The Chicago Democratic Â»latform and
its leaders and orators assail the ad
ministration of their own creation for
its enforcement of public law and the
'protection of the property of the United
States. The Republican party does not
conceal its purpose to maintain now,
; as In all the years of the past, public
law and preserve public peace, and
it will never consent to dishonor the
American name or discredit its honor.

WHEAT AND SILVER.
Now that the rapid rise in wheat while
silver continues to fall has disclosed even
to the stupidest of the Bryanites the folly
of their main contention in this campaign
they are probably in a condition to learn
the truth on that subject and profit by it.
Wheat has never followed silver in any
of the vicissitudes of price, nor has silver
followed or been affectea by the rise or
fall in the price of wheat. There are some
facts concerning the wheat market, how
ever, which it is well for people to con
sider at this time. They show that Ameri
can tariff legislation, by increasing or
diminishing the American home market
for farm products, has had an important
bearing on the price of wheat and has ma
terially affected the welfare of the farmer.
The average per capita consumption of
wheat during the last year of Harrison's
administration was nearly 6% bushels,
while under Cleveland the consumption
has been V-i bushels per capita lees. Dur
ing Harrison's administration the selling
price of wheat for the iast two years
averaged about 84 cents per bushel, but
when Cleveland was elected and the free
trade regime began the price went down
to about 50 cents per bushel.
The present rise in wheat has been
caused by the reported decline in the pro
duction of the wheat fields of India and
Australia. If now McKinley should be
elected and the protective tariff restored
there would be added to the present de
mand the increase in demand that wouid
result from an improved home market,
and the rise, winch otherwise will be but
temporary, would then be permanent and
las'.ing.
It can hardly be necessary to point out
to the farmers of the United States the
lesson to be learned from the course of the
wheat market. While to men in the cities
that lesson has been one Xo be gathered
from reading market reports, to the farmer
it has been a lesson of personal experience.
He is aware that wheat was higher under
the administration of Harrison than under
that of Cleveland and he now tees that
the price of silver had nothing whatsoever
to do with it. The application of the les
son is plain. If the farmer cares anything
for bis own welfare and the prosperity of
his home his own common-sense will tell
him that he should vote for McKinley
and Hobart, the champions of the home
market for American produce and Ameri
cau labor. ______^_____
FOREIGN IMMIGRATION.
" For the protection of the quality of
our American citizenship and of the wages
of our vrorkingmen, against the favored
competition of low-priced labor, we de
mand that the immigration iaws be thor
oughly enforced, and so extended as to
exclude from entrance into the United
States those who can neither read nor
write."
In this plank the Republican National
platform of 1896 gives pledges to the peo
ple upon one of the most important issues
of the day. The Immigration Restriction
League has just issued a publication pre
pared from data furnished by the Com
missioner-General of Immigration, which
shows that with the revival of prosperity
in this country there has come a large
increase in the immigration; and, more
over, that the percentage of illiteracy is
greater than in the previous year.
The total immigration of the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1895, was 258,538, and for
the fiscal year of 1896 was 343,267. showing
an increase for^the year oi 84,731. The
number debarred from entrance or re
turned within one year after landing was
2389 for the year 1895 and 3037 this yearâ
that is to Bay, 1 per cent was returned last
year and this year 0.9. While the per
centage of immigrants returned was less
this year than for the previous one, the
total number of illiterates who entered
was largely increased, the number of this
class being 42,142 in 1895 and 83,196 for the
year ending June, 1896.
Another evil noted by the league Is that
a very large proportion of tba immigrants
this year comes from Eastern Europe, and
consists largely of unskilled labor. Immi
grants of this character not only disturb
th.c labor market byieducing wages, but
go far toward lowering the standard of
American citizenship. With such facts as
these before us every citizen will recognize
the importance of not merely enforcing
existing laws with greater energy than
has been done by the Cleveland adminis
tration, but of extending them bo as to ex*
elude illiterates altogether.
For these reasons the trfank in the
Republican National platform which we
have quoted becomes an important issue
in the campaign. There would be little
danger of Bryan's appeal to discontent
and ignorance if we forbade the importa
tion of the discontented and the ignorant
from Europe. This issue affects every
other issue in the campaign, and in the
name of American labor and American
citizenship we urge all who desire the wel
fare of the country to support the men
who will enforce this law, as well as all
other laws of the Republic
HON. JAMES A. BARHAM.
Every Republican in the First Congressional District is working hard to bring
about the re-election ot Representative James A. Barham of Santa Rosa.
Mr. Barham is a lawyer by profession and never held public office until his elec
tion to Congress two years ago. He was born in Missouri in July, 1844, and removed
with his parents to California in 1849; so, in addition to being a good Republican, Mr.
Barham has the merit of being a pioneer. He was educated in the public schools and
at Hesperian College in Woodland. After leaving the latter institution he sought to
qualify himself for the serious business of life by school teaching, and he labored in
that occupation for three years. Then he began the study of the law, and having
passed a highly creditable examination was admitted to practice in 1868.
Mr. Barham continued in his chosen profession, reaching a high position at the
Sonoma County bar, until he was selected by the Republicans two years ago to make
the Congressional race against "Tom" Geary, who had been in Congress so long that
tte began to think he had a life tenure in the office. The result of the contest at tne
close of the polls on election day was: J. A. Barham, 15,101 votes, against 13,570 for T.
J. G?ary (D-), 7246 for R. J. Grigsby (P.), and 790 for Dr. J. R. Gregory (Prohibitionist).
Mr. Barham was unanimously nominated for re-election to the Fil'ty-nfth Con
gress at the Republican District Convention.

WHAT FREE WOOL DID.
An Object Iciton for the American
Voter.
American Economist.
I am for free wool In order tbat our woolen man
nfactnrens, unburdened by a tax upon foreign wool
and unburdened by like lax upon home-grown
wool, may manufacture lor a wider market.â Hod.
William Jennings Bryan, in congress.
Let us see how Mr. Bjr yan's theory has worked
out in practice.
The comparison that we aie now making be
tween the condition of American wage-earners
this year and in 1892 has brought us 105 re
ports from manufacturers of woolen and
worsted goods. These reports show the num
ber of hands employed in these establishments
two years after enjoyment of the protestion
afforded by the McKinley tariffâ in July, 1892
âand two years after the enjoyment of the
great free trade gilt of free woolâ in July,
1896. The results to labor compare as follows:
S& of Hands employed. ' A mt. of wages paid.
con- Julr, July. July, July,
Crrns. i892. 1896. 1892. 1896.
105 21,754 11,433 $623,468 1273.762
Hands idle in July, 1896â 10,321, or almost 60
per rent.
Wages lost Id July, 1896-*549,6Â»6, or over 56
per cent, or at the rate of 94,196,362 a year In 105
establishments.
Average monthly wages in July, 1892, $29,
Average monthly wages in July, 1896. $24.
It appears, then, that the Democratic gift of
free wool, which Mr. Bryan advocated and
voted for, Instead cf enabling oar woolen
manufacturers to "manufacture for a wider
market," has contracted by fully one-half the
market that they used : in 1992. Bo
much so that they have been compelled to dis
charge almost 50 per cent of their hands; to
reduce the average rate of wages by $5 a
mouth among those who were fortunate
enough to retain their jobs, and to decrease
the total payrolls of the mills by 56 per Cent â
at the rate ot $4,196,352 a year in 105 fac
tories.
The reports cover rather more than one-sixth
of the total number of the wage-earners in the
woolen-mills in 1890, and also rather more
than one-sixth of the total amount of wages
paid them in the same year.
Therefore, applying our results to the cen
sus figures, we tind that there were over 60,000
workers idle in all our woolen-mills after two
years of the free trade in wool experiment;
also that their total annual loss of wages ag
gregated at the rate of $25,000,000 a year.
But the results are even worse than this be
cause the effect of the protective tariff of 1890
was to largely increase the number of our
woolen-mills: to largeiy increase the number
of hands working in the mills, and to largely
widen the market for our woolen goods. Hence
the comparison with IS9O by no means re
flects a proper comparison with the total con
dition of the industry of 1892. It is perfectly
safe to say that more than 60,000 woolen
workers have been out of employment owing
to the Democratic policy of free trade in wool,
which Bryan voted for, and that their loss of
wngps has been more than at the rate of $25,
--000,000 a year.
But let the "object lesson" stand as It is.
We wonder how many of these idle woolen
worKera believe that Bryan's latest theoryâ
fiee silverâ will open the woolen-mills. They
k now tnat, under McKinley protection in 1892,
the woolen-mills were running and the hands
were working. They know that, under Bry
an's free trade in wool policy, the mills have
been closed and the hands idle. They are- sat
isfied with this knowledge. They will iurtber
contrast the opposing policies as expressed by
the two candidates for President of the Lnited
States:
BRYAN. IÂ£'KIXIJSY.
"I am for free wooL" "If there is any one in
dustry which appeals
with more force than
another for defensive
duties It is this. Â«c
cannot afford as a na
tion to permit this In
dustry to te longer
crippled."
Mr. Bryan would continue existing condi
tions. Mr. McKinley will restore the condi
tions of 1892.
RISING WHEAT, FALLING SILVER
The recent advance in the price of wheat and
other farm products Is a cold fact that gives
the Bryan Populists no end of trouble. Bryan
himself seems to have been judicious enough
to let It alone. Others havo exposed them
selves to the operation of that buzzsaw with
no small detriment to their tissues. Accord
ing to these philosophers the prices of wheat
ana otner farm proaucts have fallen since 1873
because in that year Congress did not provide
for coining a silver piece which was not then
in v se as money at all and never has been to
any appreciable extent from the establish
ment of the mint down. They persistently as
serted that the fsll of wheat had kept pace
with the fall of silver. The assertion was un
true, but it seemed to be useless to prove its
falsity, for the Populists simply ignored the
proof and reiterated the falsehood. The ad
vance in the price of wheat, com, etc., comes
most opportunely not only for the good of the
iarmer, but as an exposure of the Populist
falsehood that goes straight to every farmer
and cannot be hid awey.â -Chicago chronicle.
Silver has gone so low since Mr. Bryon began
his campaign that the bullion value of a silver
dollar Is now less than 50 cents, and in the
same time wheat has gone beyond 75 cents a
bushel. According to Mr. Bryan, wheat
ought to be less than 58 cents a bushel, but,
unfortunately for him, the law of demand and
supply does precisely for wheat what it does
for silver. When people want wheat and there
Is not enough wheat to supply their needs the
value of wheat goes up. Wnen people do not
want wheat because tuey have more than they
can consume, or there is more than they are
able io buy, the value of wheat goes down.
That is what is the troujjle with Bllver. There
is more silver in the world than is needed for
coining purposes. More silver is produced
than the world can use with, advantage to
itself. Therefore, the value of sliver goes
down, and It will keep on going down.â New
York Press.
THE SILVER TRUST.
New York Advertiser.
The World has been doing splendid work in
exposing the plots of the silver trust The
great mass of facts and figures which have
been laid before the American people should
convince fair-minded men that the members
of the silver trust are only anxious io double
and quadruple their own va-st fortunes, and
care nothing whatever who may be hurt in so
doing. The commerce of the Nation may be
paralyzed and the good name of the States
scorned and jeered at in every part of the
world, but what do the mine owners caret It
is asserted thiit in Colorado alone a "boodle
fund" of over $300,000 has been raised to help
the free silver campaign. If Bryan should be
elected and free coinage oi silver should be
brought about the silver-mine owners expect
to realize enormously. Not all of them believe
that silver can be "raised" in value to $1 29
an ounce, as Bryan professes to believe, but
they seem to be quite sure that there will be
some sort of an increase in price, and it is this,
great or small, that they are after.
The total profit they would obtain is almost
too large to calculate. It is estimated that In
the State of Colorado alone the mines there,
already appraised at $122,350,000, would
double in value. This, of course, is on the
supposition that silver would increase in value
with the election of Bryan.
This is where the real interest is in Bryan's
election. The only men who want him to
succeed are the members of the dishonest sil
ver trust, who hope to add millions a year to
their already large fortunes. In each of the
mining States they are subscribing liberally to
the corruption funds. They can well afford to
do so. It is the last chance they will ever
have to put the silver question to a vote.

ANGRY MINERS
HELD IN ALASKA
They Have Reached Sitka,
but Cannot Get Any
Further.
The Governor Would Not Allow
the Excelsior to Bring
Them On.
NO BOATS TILL NEXT SPEING.
Narrow Escape of the Lansing and
Progreso From a Collision
at Sea.
There are 220 angry miners in Sitka,
Alaska, and when they air their grievances
in San Francisco there will be some tall
talking. The following dispatch from Cap
tain Higgins of the steam-schooner Ex
celsior was received yesterday:
Nakaimo, B. C, Oct. 20, 1896.
We arrived at SHka on the 13th with 220
passengers and much treasure aboard. There
was no steamer for Seattle and no accommoda
tions, and as the Excelsior would Dot be al
lowed to take the uassengers on there is great
indignation. A petition to the Governor was
got up. but he reiused to interfere.
Cooks Inlet is freezing up and all the miners
save a few who will go down on the Dora are
out. The Marion sailed September 28 with
sixty passengers. We have had nothing but
heavy gales for tbe past fortnight. Will load
coal at Xanainio for home.
The story is almost all told in tbe above.
Some months ago the steam schooner Ex
celsior was chartered to go to Cooks Inlet
and bring a large party of miners to the
Sound if possible, if not to Sitka. On ar
riving at the latter port the miners found
that the City of Topekaand the Queen had
been taken off the route for the winter, |
and that unless they could get away on
the Excelsior they would have, to remain
in Alaska for several months longer. It
was then that they petitioned the Gov
ernor for permission to leave on tbe Ex
celsior, but for some reason he refused, j
The only chance for a few of them will be
to get down on either the Dora or the rev
enue cutter Bear. Those who fail will
have to remain in Sitka unless a special
boat is sent up to bring them down. The
talk on the water front was to that effect
yesterday, but the chances are that noth
ing will be done until Captain Higgins gets
nere from Nanainio and brings full par
ticulars.
Captain Hatfield of the British ship
Linsing and Captain Storrs of the
Progreso are congratulating themselves
that they are still alive and that their
vessels are afleat. Early yesterday morn
ing they almost collided in a dense fog,
and had it not been for the presence of
) mind ot the master of the sailing ship
i another disaster would have to be re
corded.
"It was 12:15 a. m. yesterday when the
two vessels grazed eacn otner," said Cap
tail) riatiield. "I was making port and
the Progreso was bound north. Suddenly
( the steamer loomed up out of the fog and
all I could do was to order the helm hard
a-starboard. I swung clear, but my main
yard raked the Progreso and did some
damage. When we brought up the ves
sels were almost stern to stern and I
could easily converse with Captain Storrs.
It was the narrowest escape I ever had in
my life, as, had we struck, both vessels
would most assuredly have gone to the
bottom."
The Lansing brought a cargo of coal
from Cardiff and will load wheat for
Europe after discharging.
Another boat had a narrow escape yes
terday. The tug Rescue was taking out
; the bark Oakland when the hawser parted.
I The bark began to drift down on the ferry
steamer Bay City, but Captain Whitney
got the lower topsails set in- a very short
space of time and managed to shear off
just in time to escape collision. Another
I tug was sent out and she picked up the
'' Oakland and towed her to sea.
The ship Centennial, which was pur- !
chased by tbe Alaska Packing Association
a few days ago, will start for Karluk tbe
latter part of thie week to load salmon for
one of the foreign ports. In this way a
double handling of the goods will be
avoided.
The French ship General Mellinet ar
rived from Swansea yesterday. Captain
Jolivet was a very sick man during the
trip, and the first mate brought tne ship
in. The captain was laid up with a
bronchial affection, and for fifty days was
confineu to his bed. He expects the sun
shine of California to make him a whole
man again ana will go out on his ship
when ehe sails next montb.

WHEAT PRICES STEADY.
A Sharp Decline in Quotations
Yesterday With Several
Rallies.
Disheartening News From India.
Several Vessels Loading for
Calcutta.
From its dizzy location wheat looked
down toward the earth yesterday and for
the first time found where It was at. Then
it was more cautions. If it took a little
jounce upward it dropped back and sailed
along at a comparatively safe altitude.
Whether the news had come up to that
great height that the empty granaries of
India or the warehouses of Australia were
filling up or that the speculators were
waiting to catch their breath the call
board observer could not ascertain.
Albeit there was a cooling of the atmos
phere, although a wire from Chicago

would raise the temperature a few do
greep.| That market, which closed Monday
at 77% cents, opened yesterday morning
at 82&. It fell to 80% and finally rallied
to 82%. The market uere fell about V/ 2
cents on call, but also recovered *a few
cents. In the shipping market $1 45 was
quoted for No. 1 shipping and $1 50 for
milling. At 9:15 o'clock the Cali Board
sales for May ranged $1 54, $1 53, $1 52J4,
H bl}4, $1 01, fl 51J4; for December, $1 49,
$1 48 VÂ£. $1 48%, ?1 48. Then May dropped
to $1 50 and December to $1 46. A little
inspiring news from tbo Chicago pits sent
May up to $1 54 and December to $1 50.
However, May fell slowly to $1 53 and De
cember to ?1 48%. Nominal quotations in
spot wheat stood at $1 42>Â£ and |1 43 per
cental.
The latest news from India yesterday
afternoon was very disheartening, and
thÂ«>re will be no '97 wheat to export as the
sowing is now at a standstill. Tbe con
tinued drought has ruined the present
prospect of a crop beyond recovery. Aus
tralia and Argentina are suffering and
Russia is light. The Pacific Coast alone
must supply the deficiency, consequently
the farmers of California, Oregon and
Washington who have held on to their
wheat are in clover. Even Prance, which
has always been able to supply her own
demand, may have to import, as there is
a probability that her fields will go short
also.
The chartered wheat fleet here has a
registered tonnage of 80,000 tons against
59,500 of this date last year, and disen
gaged 29,600 tons against 12,500 of last
year. There are on the way to this port
252,900 tons.
The Egermont Castle will take for Cal
cutta 81,704 centals valued at $101,645 and
.the Merioneth lor Cork 46,256 centais
valued at $70,000.
L. W. McGlauflin of California street
said yesterday tbat the market was steady
and strong and while iiactuating baa an
upward tendency. The continued call for
wheat from India, whero no seed can be
sown on account of the absence of rain,
will keep prices up for the present at least.

THE HORSE SHOW.
Additions to th-e List of Frizes Already-
Announced.
At a recent meeting of directors of the
Horse Show Association the following ad
ditions were made to the list of prizes
already published, viz. :

hands 1 inch, shown in brougham or
victoria, Rudolph Spreckels presents sil
ver cup, value $200, to supplement the
cash prizes; first $100, second $50, third
$25. In the official prize -list already
issued George A. Pope appears as the
donor of the cup in this class, but tbe
changes now announced have since been
agreed to.
In class 86, for fire department horses,
two divisions have been made, viz.:
(1) Three-horse teams â First prize, sil

In the section for draught horses over
1500 pounds, to be shown- in harness, *
further class has been added for single
horsesâ first prize $30, second $20, third
$10, and it is Hoped that several line ani
mals that are working in single draught
in this City and other towns will be ex
hibited in this class.
A suggestion has been made that a spe
cial exhibit of six-in-hand teams should
be arranged for, and in all probability this
will be acted upon.
Tne prospects for the show are reporled
to be excellent, and a general improve
ment in all the classes, as compared with
previous exhibitions, is looked lor.
Intending exhibitors should bear in
mind that November 14 is the last day for
making entries.

FOLSOM GRANITE TO BE USED,
Architect of Affiliated Colleges Will
Not Secure Pay From Faculty
or Contractors.
Monday evening Governor Bndd tele
graphed to Sacramento requesting that
JL^evi Rackliffe, State Treasurer, and Lewis
H. Brown, Secretary of State, come imme
diately to San Francisco. Under thÂ« law
appropriating $250,000 to build for the
Affiliated Colleges these officers and the
Governor are bound to approve the ac
cepted contracts for construction, More
over no changes or modification of plans
can be made without their assent. In re
sponse to the Governor's wire the Treas
urer and Secretary arrived in the City yes
terday morning and attended a joint
meeting of tbe law and building com
mittee of the Board of Regents, which was
beld prior to the regular session of the
board yesterday.
Complications growing out of the prom
ise of Dr. Beverley Cole and the medical
faculty to pay the architect $11,000 to
make good commissions waived in order
to bring the cost of the building within
the limit of $250,000 rendered immediate
action of some kind necessary. The Gov
ernor was convinced that some agreement
had been reached by which the contrac
tors had consented to reimburse the fac
ulty, and therefore manifested a firm de
termination to change the order of things*

almost at the point of revoking his gift.
Last Monday be consented to extend the
time until October 30. This brief exten
sion explains the prompt action of tbe
Governor in calling the Treasurer and Sec
retary to the City.
The joint committee meeting yesterday
was attended by the Governor, Judge
Wallace, Arthur Rodgers, J. West Martin,
H. S. Foot? and the board's attorney,
Major Mhoon. It was decided in effect to
modify tbe specifications, admit the use
of Folsom granite on the easy terras
granted by the Board of State Prison Di
rectors, and through such changes bring
about a reduction of $15,000. Under this
order of proceeding the architect will re
ceive his commissions from the board, ac
cording to contract. The faculty and the
contractors will therefore be absolved
from all responsibility in the case.
When the regents were called to order
in regular session the following responded
to the roll call: Governor Budd, Judge
Wallace, Arthur Rodgers, Albert Miller,
A. S. -Hallidie, T. G. Pneips, President
Kellogg, J. West Martin, George T. Marye
and H. S. Foote.
The session was brief. Judge Wallace
from the law committee reported that a
conference had been held, and that all the
difficulties were in the way of speedy ad
justment. He observed that the Treas
urer and Secretary of State had readily
as-dstea in the settlement. He asked that
this statement be accepted as a report of
progress and that the committee be given
until Saturday at 10 a. m. to prepare the
final report. On Judgo Wallace's motion
tbe board adjourned until that time.
Mayor Sutro attended the open session
and was cordially greeted by the regents.
Extreme care was taken to avoid discus
sion or the introduction of any topic which
might disturb the Mayor's placid and, pe
rene demeanor. All the regents acknowl
edge that he has been extremely indul
gent as well as generous. He is not yet
convinced that the colleges are to be

THE REVOLVER WENT OFF.
Exciting Scnffle In a IfÂ»T*nworth-
Street Fruit store.
George Davis, who has a fruitstore at
220U Learenworth street, had a dispute
with another man last night in his store.
The man struck him in the eye, and Davis
pulled a revolver out of his pocket.
Three men, who were with his assailant,
jumped upon him, and in the struggle
the revolver was discharged, fortunately
without injuring any one.
The report of the shot attracted a large
crowd, and some one notified the Central
police station. Policeman Durkin was
sent to the store, but could not gain much
information. Davis said the revolver was
accidentally discharged in the scuffle. He
said he knew the men, but did not know
their names, and that be would swear oat
warrants for their arrest this morning.
NO ENTHUSIASM
FOR I. J. BRYAN
Scanty Contributions for
the Democratic Cam
paign.
People Give as They Vote and
This Year McKinley is a
Winner.
NOT LIKE A BEANSTALK STORY
The "Popular" Fund Started by the
"Examiner" Has Proved a
Flat Failure.
The Democratic State Committee is not
yet happy. The members of the commit
tee, led by young Mr. Alford, the boy
manager of the boy orator's campaign in
California, are pained because the people
of California are not responding to the
appeal for campaign funds.
This want of alacrity in sending in
money is looked on as a lack of enthusi
asm on the part of the people, for if the
people were really in earnest in their de
sire to help along the election of Mr.
Bryan, they would certainly put up
enough coin to keep the campaign com
mittee's machinery in wording order.
Undoubtedly these gentlemen of thÂ«
Democratic State Committee are right,
and their gloomy forebodings are well
founded. The people of the State are evi
dently indifferent to the pleadings of Mr.
Alford and his associates, nor has the ef
fort of the Examiner to arouse a little arti
ficial enthusiasm proved to them suffi
ciently satisfactory. By offering to dupli
cate all the contributions of its subscrib
ers the Examiner in about two weeks'
time has realized but $2652 90, which
means that "tue common people" to
whom an impassioned appeal was mane
have given only half that sum, which is
exactly $1326 45, which is not a very good
financial showing for the alleged majority
predicted by the Democratic State Com
mittee.
In political affairs as well as in all other
matters it is an established fact that peo
ple give as they vote and feel, and when
the people show such an absence of inter
est in Mr. Bryan's campaign it is a clear
illustration of the truth that they are no
longer warm and strong in the faith.
The Republican State Committee, on
the contrary, is constantly in receipt of
support from the voters' throughout the
State. They are enthusiastic for McKin
ley and believe he will win.
This falling away in Democratic ea
thusiasm worries not only the Democratic
leaders but is extremely annoying to the
newspaper that started this "popular"
subscription. It was at first expected that
this would be another case of "Jack and
the Beanstalk," but so slow were the peo
ple in coming forward that the campaign
will be over before the sum of $4000, which

In the meantime the Democrats are go

there is really no dearth of Democratic

RUNS A FAMOUS
FRONTIER JOURNAL
He Collects the News for
His Paper by Dog Team
for 2000 Miles.
Struggles oi G C. Bettles and
Rev. Mr Prevost in Issuing
the Yukon Press.
SOME BIG GOID PECJECTS.
Mr. Bettles' Interesting Story of Life
in the Alaska Wi!d<r
ness-
Gordon C. Battles, who for some time
past has been publishing a paper at the
most remote point on the American con
tinent, is at the Commercial. The paper
is the Yukon Press, and it appears three
times a year. The reason it is not issued
oitener is because, as he says, the news
has to be collected for 2000 miles, and it
takes four months each time to do it.
Mr. Bettles, though also a big mining
operator and running tnree trading posts,
learned the printing trade in his youth.
At the post at Tanaua, near the mouth of
the Tanana River, 1000 miles up the
Yukon, the Rev. Jules L. Prevosthas been
iloing missionary work among the Indians.
He desired to translate and print portions
of the Scriptures in the Indian tongue, so
Mr. Bettles told him ;o get a little print
ing outfit, and in his leisure hours In the
long winter he would leach him how to
set the type.
The missionary got the inatsrial and
then it struck him it would be a good
thing to get out a little paper also. So Mr.
Bettles has been steering the little journal
through. He has also taught the minister
so that he can now get it out himself. It
is a paper of sixteen small pages, and is
printed on a job press. The news is very
interesting, and the paper is highly appre
ciated there, for it seems to break the
monotony of things. It has a number of
advertisements, but owing to the, as yet,
limited circulation the rates are not high.
Mr. Bettles is an all-round sort of a
young man who can turn his hand to any
thing and make a success of it. He is a
brother of H. A. Bettles; president of the
famous Homestake Goldmining Company
of the Black Hilis and superintendent of
the Granite Mountain Mining Company
of Montana. He went to the interior of
the Yukon nine years ago and this is the
first time he has been out.
The enterprising gentleman disclaims
much o: the credit for the appearance of
the Press. He is a practical milling man,
having learned the milling of ore at Lead
ville for Senator Tom "Brown in the Sum
mit district of Colorado and at Granite,
Mont. He now has a number of big quartz
leads on the Yukon and tributaries, which
with his fur and goods trading posts make
him, as the miners with him say, in the
way of making a million or so of dollars.
Mr. Bettles brought down with him sev
eral hundred pounds of quartz. He has
beiore had big assays from it and now he
is going to have some mill runs. If the
ore runs as he expects he will take up a
quartz mill with him when he returns in
the spring.
"It is difficult to publish a paper up
there." said Mr. Bettles yesterday, "be
cause it takes so long to collect the news.
W r hy, the resuit of this election in the
United States will not be known there for
eight months, There might be war here,
and it could continue for most of a year
before we would hear of it. To get the
news of the Yukon alone means covering
2000 miles of country by dog teams. It is
by these teams that the news is brought.
"I would have been on a visit hero be
fore, but I didn't want to come out till I
bad tested the country and found out
whether it was any account or not. I
thought if it was not I wouldn't Â«o back.
Now that I have fully tested it I am sat
isfied it is going to be one of the greatest
of mining countries. There are enormous
quartz ledges there, and they are very
rich. Quartz mining is to be the thing in
that country, but this kind of mining has
been very slow because it takes money to
carry it on.
"Our miners were poor and had to make
money as they went along, so they turned
their "attention first to placer mining. It
is in quartz, however, that the big money
is to be made."
Aside from the trading post in which he
has an interest at Tanana, he is interested
in one at Nulatto, 6iXÂ» miles up the Yukon,
and also up the Koukuk River, 600 miles
from its mouth. Mr. Bettles says that in
bis judgment Tanana is to be the great
camp of the interior. There is a great
deal of quartz t:ere and it is rich. The
Tanana River is 1200 milp-> long and lies
between the Copper and White rivers. It
is a mile wide at its mouth.

CHARGED WITH EXTORTION
David and William Crowley of
the Electric Laundry
Amstfd.
The Complaining Witness Is Charles
S Graver, One of Their Shirt
Ironers-
Charles 8. Gruver, 1544 Howard street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Campbell's
court yesterday mornin? charging David
Crowley and William Crowley with
extortion.
In the complaint, which was drawn up
by Attorney Morganstern, it is alleged
that the Crowleys, who are proprietors of
the Electric Laundry, 210 Valencia street,
locked Gruver in their office last Saturday
and threatened to have him arrested and
placed in custody unless he should accede
to their demand to pay them $30, and,
Laving the fear that they would carry out
their threat and having money in their
possession belonging to him, he signed a
receipt for $30.
Attorney Morganstern said that Gruver
had been in the employment of the Crow
leys for the past two years. He was a
young man, 22 years of age, and was con
sidered one ol the besl sbirt-ironers in the
business.
"I presume," said the attorney, "with
the object of blackening his character and
being afraid that he would leave them
and go to a rival concern, the Crowleys on
Saturday took him into their office, locked
the door and charged him with stealing
articles from the distributing-room. He
denied the accusation and they brought
in three or four employes in the distribut
ing department, who backed up their em
ployers' assertion.
"Gruver was dumfounded, knowing
his entire innocence, and asked that he
should oe allowed to send for his mother
or for me, but they refused to do so, and,
nnder a threat of ariest and exposure,
made him sign the receipt for $30. They
were owing him about $60 for wag es.
"Gruver is a quiet, hard-working, boncst
young man, and feels the slight upon his
character very bitterly. l want the
Crowleys to understand that in a civilized
community such an act of extortion will
not be tolerated."
The Crowleys were arrested yesterday
afternoon and taken to the Seventeenth
street station. They immediately gave bail
for their appearance.
"The charee of extortion is absurd," said
David Crowley last night. "I hate to
speak about the matter, but the fact is we
had for months been missing articles from
the distributing department. Our suspi
cions fell upon Gruver, and something
occnrreJ on Friday to confirm them.
We called him into our office, but did not
lock the dcor, and told him of what we
accused him. He acknowledged it, and
we agreed to drop the matter if he paid us
$30. That was all there was to it. He is a
first-class workman, and we overlooked
his faults for that reason."
MAY WANT TO BUY.
English Capitalists Hnve an Kxpert Ex
amining Mining Property.
Scott F. Bickford of C. X. Bixford A Co.,
bankers and brokers, Boston, is at the Oc
cidental, accompanied by Charles P. How
ard, Mr. Abbott and others, who with
himself are owners of the noted Pioneer
gold mine in Placer County.
This mine was formerly owned by the
Fair estate. It has always been a good
mine, but lately has turned out very rich.
The Eastern purchasers are greatly pleased
with it. They acquired it over a year ago,
and lately have been visiting and examin
ing the mine. They had an expert along
who was examining the property in de
tail, with the object of reporting it for
some foreign capitalists, who are consid
ering the purchase of large interests in the
mine.
''We are very much pleased with the
Pioneer," said Mr. Bickford, who is a di
rector in the company, "and are satisfied
with it in every way. We are driving a
1000-foot tunnel by the aid of six air drills
and one air compressor, and wiil add six
more of the drills and another compressor.
"The 20-stamp mill in the mine, which
has been going for years, will before long
be increased to 40-stamps. We are working
on the average about sixty men, and are
crushing some forty tons ol ore a day.
"Il Major McKinley is elected President
I know of a great deal of money that will
come for investment to the gold mines of
California. It will be both from the
Eastern States and from .England. We
are pretty close to some foreign investors,
being in the banking tmsiness. I think a
great deal of money will come here pro
vided the election comes out all right."
Tainted Salmon Sn'zed.
Chief Food Inspector Dockery and Chief
Maruet IngDector Davis, of the Board of
Health, condemned 20,000 pounds of salted
salmon on the Pacific-street wharf yesterday.
The fish came from Alaska and had probably
been packed after becoming stale, as it was
palpably unfit for food. The man who pur
chased itâ B. Sternâ did not return for his
goods, and it will be sent to the fertilizing
works to-day.
Signs of Better Times.
The movement in the interest of home In
dustries has been productive of splended re
sults in one direction at least. The local shoe
business has increased wonderfully. At the
meeting of the Shoemakers' Union last night
most encouraging reports were made to the
effect that nearly all of the manufacturers are
busy night as well as day filling large local
orders.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1896.
TO RAZE THE
TOWER OF DEATH
Scenes of the Emmanuel
Church Crimes to Be
Removed.
The Blocd-Stained Spire to Come
Down as Soon as Pos
sible.
A FAIS TO SECURE THE FUNDS.
Ceptain LÂ»es Says There Must Be No
Alterations in the Build-
The noted tower of Emmanuel Baptist
Church on Bartlett street, where the nude
body of murdered Blanche Lamont was
found, and in the basement of which the
remains of Minnie Williams were dis
covered the day before, is to be removed.
After discovering the dreadful tragedy
that blotted out the lives of two innocent
girls and stained the sacred edifice with
blood the question of tearing down the
church and either erecting another build
ing or disposing of the property by sale
arose.
The trustees and members felt keenly
the horrible notoriety that had come upon
their organization, but as they were heav
ily in debt and had also expended consid
erable money in the purchase of the lot
and in the erection of the church they felt
they could not make the sacrifices neces
sary.
Consequently, in the face of popular dis
approval, they heroically resolved to con
tinae to worship in the building that bore
the burden of its awful crime, and in the
future, when they could take upon them
selves the additional expense, they would
remodel the structure and, if possible, ob
literate somewhat the ever-present re
minder of the great crime of the century.
For this purpose a church fair, to last
several days, was opened last evening by
the lady members of the congregation.
The lower or basement part of the build
ing hud been beautifully decorated with
trailing vines and green foliage and in the
assercbly-room a number of handsome
booths have been put up. In the infant
classroom tabiea were laid, where refresh
ments will be provided for visitors during
the week.
There are a number of booths hand
somely arranged and presided over by ex
ceedingly pretty girls, where articles of
use and beauty are disposed of for the
common good of the cause. The fair is
under the direction of the Ladies' Aid
Society, of which Mrs. R. W. Moore is
president, assisted by the King's Daugh
ters, Young People's and Junior Endeavor
societies. It will be open every evening
till Saturday. The admission is 25 cents,
which includes supper.
Robert N. Lynch, the pastor's assist
ant, stated that it was trie intention
of the officers of the church to make a
great many changes in the building, espe
cially in that portion fronting on Bartlett
street. He did not think there would be
any objection from the prosecution in the
Durrani case.
One of the trustees present stated that it
was their intention to remodel the entire
building and change the shape of the
tower for reasons well Known to the pub
lic, and it being their property there was
no law to prevent them doing as they
choose.
They had permitted the prosecution to
tear up floors, remove doors and other
wise mutilate the structure, and had
assisted the officers in uncovering the
great and deplorable crime, and now they
must be permitted to make the much
needed repairs and changes.
In an interview late last evening Captain
Lees stated emphatically that he was sure
no changes would be made in the s'ructure
at present, at least not till after the Dur
rant case was ended.
Mr. Taber, one of the trustees, had vis
ited him a few days ago, and during the
conversation between the two the ques
tion was settled. It may be necessary to
visit the tower with witnesses and a new
jury, and for that reason it is better that
no changes be made in the structure.
UNDER DETENTION.
E. F. Clarke, Son of a New York
Wholesale Grocer, In the
City Prison.
E. F. Clarke, an elegantly dressed young
man, was arrested at the Palace Hotel last
night by Detective Ross Whitaker and
Policeman Smith Carr and is being de
tained in the City Prison pending an in
vestigation.
Clarke says he is a son of a well-known
wholesale grocer in New York, and has
been stopping at the Palace. He ran
short of funds and drew a draft on New
York for $250. He placed it in the hands
of a friend to get cashed, and the friend
not having the money himself, took the
draft to J. A. Folger & Co., the wholesale
coffee and spice men on California street,
who discounted it.
Yesterday the draft was returned from
New York dishonored and Folger & Co.
communicated that fact to the gentleman
who took it to them. Instead of going to
Clarke and asking for an explanation he
went to police headquarters and asked
tnat Clarke be arrested.
Clarke says that if he had been given an
opportunity to telegraph to New York the
matter would have been satisfactorily ar
ranged and he would not have been put
to the indignity of being arrested and de
tained in prison.
He was not locked up in a cell, bat was
permitted to stretch himself on chairs in
Captain Robinson's office.

Meeting of the League of Mutual
Building and Loan Asso
ciations.
THE MORTGAGE TAX DISCUSSED
A Preposition to Have the State Pay
the Commissioners Who Super
vise the Association.
The annual meeting ot the California
League of Mutual Building and Loan As
sociations was held yesterday in Assem
bly Hall in the Mills building. Frank Otis,
president, presided, and Charles F. Nay
lor, secretary, called the roll of delegates:
The following associations were repre
sented:
San Francisco Loan, Cosmos Loan, Metropoli
tan Loan of Los Angeles, Encinal Building and
Loan of Alameda, San Francisco and Oakland
Mutual Loan, Granite Mutual Building and
Loan, San Francisco Home Mutual, Inter-Nog
Building and Loon, Eiutracht Saving and
Building Verein, People's Building and Loan,
San Diego Building and Loan, Fairmount
Loan oi San Francisco, Mission ana Home
Loan. Italian-Swiss Mutual Loan, Bor
rowers' Mutual oi San Francisco. Mutual
Building and Loan of Pasadena, San Jose
Building and Loan, San Luis Building and

California Building and Loan of Alameda,
Santa Clara Building and Loan, Commercial
Building and Loan, Alameda Building and
Loan. Citizens' Building and Loan of San
Francisco, Home Security Building and Loan,
Homestead ot Berkeley, Southern California
Loan, Home Mutual of San Francisco.
President Frank Otis presented his an
nual report, a very lengthy document.
He drew attention to the reports of the
commissioners of building and loan asso
ciations, which in the past year had driven !
out of business twenty foreign concerns I
which had entered the State. The asso- j
ciations, he said, during the year dis
bursed to members in loans and for can- :
celed shares $8,471,497 10. The associa- j
tions have a membership of 30J50, and
were instrumental in building 9343 Homes
within this Ktate. The profits on with
drawals by local associations amounted to
36.08 per cent, by the nationals 15.52 per
cent and by co-operative banks 8.16 per
cent, while the cost to borrowers in locals
has been 8.98 per cent, nationals 11.10
percent and in co-operative banks 10.12 per
cent. The associations paid last year for
taxes about $230,000 on their mortgage !
loans.
He dwelt at length on the subject!
whetner it would be wise for the associa- |
tions to take part in politic*. He took |
occasion to dt-clare that on the financial
proposition it was eminently proper and,
indeed, imperative that the associations
should place themselves on record. They
sought to do business on Dusiness princi
ples, and in carrying out this poiicy
it was necessary that they should
take every means to uphold the
financial honor and honesty of the
country. He cited numerous exam
ples to prove that the prosperity of the
world was practically confined to such
countries as had a gold standard, the re
verse being true of those laboring under
tbe disadvantage of a silver monetary
system. He bad every confidence, how
ever, that the goocl sense of the American
people, as shown at the coming election. J
would forever put at rest the anarchistic j
theories and schemes of the unthinking
advocates of the proposed new order of
things.
He then said that all loans of building
and loan associations to their members
were made under the present monetary |
standard, and asked if it would not be un
fair for borrowers to pay back in a depre
ciated currency. He added : "The prop
osition that full and unlimited legal ten
der will relieve the debtor is clearly a
confession of its iniquity, for, by that very
relief, it will rob every creditor," no matter
how small may be the debt due to him."
He closed by arguing the fostering of
builuing and loan associations.
Secretary Naylor called for the indorse
ment of the following resolutions that
were adopted at the convention of the
United States League of Building and
.Loan Associations on the currency ques
tion held in Philadelphia:
First â That it is the sense of this meeting
that the interests of all shareholders of build
ing and loan associations in the United States
demaud that the present standard of values
upon which our monetary system has been
based since the resumption of specie payments
iv 1879 shall remain inviolate.
Secondâ That we believe that the interests of
overy class in the community, and especially
â¢ those of the great wage-earning class, impera
tively demand thst every dollar in circulation,
whether coin or paper, shall be equal in pur
chasing power, aud therefore equal in value to
â¢Very other.
Thirdâ That patriotism demands that the
dollar bearing the mint mark of the United
(-totes s'lall be equal to the dollar of the most
edvanced nations and entitled to the full faith
and credit all over the world, and to that end
it must be maintained free from all suspicion
of debasement or repudiation.
The resolutions were indorsed by a
unanimous vote.
A. Sbarboro read a paper on "State
Supervision," in whicn he said that the
building and loan societies had reached
such a magnitude thai it was deemed ad
visable by the league to have a State Com- I
mission appointed to inspect and super
vise the societies. He, while speaking
favorably cf the supervision, thought the
tax on the societies to maintain the Com
missioners is very heavy, and offered a
resolution to the effect that the Legisla
ture continue the Commissioners and pay
them from the trea-ury ot the State.
O. K. Cusning read a paper on the
"Abolishment of Premiums." He said
that premiums are not a fundamental
principle of the associations, and that
ihey are not a feature ot mutuality, be
cause at one meeting a loan may be at a
very high premium and another a very
low one. He urged the abolition of this
feature.
George G. Vv right read an interesting
paper on "Mortgage Taxation." He re
ferred to the introduction of the system,
and stated that he had at first been in
favor of the prdposed amendment reliev
ing the lender of the necessity of paying
the mortgage tax, but further investiga
tion had caused him to change his mind.
At tbe afternoon session there was a dis
cussion on th*> mortgage tax. One mem
ber was of the opinion that there was no
good reason for the abolition of the mort
gage tax.
Mr. Sbarboro said it was a wrong con
ception of tbe matter lo hold that the
mortgage tax was the cause of reduction
of interest on deposits.
D. Henderson, a banker o* Santa Clara
County, said a formidable obstacle would
be presented by the repeal of tne mort
gage tax. It would not, in his opinion,
reduce taxation. The repeal, he thought,
would rfisult in double taxation and be a
great hardship on th* borrowers, who are
Â» generally people of very limited means.
Mr. Meyer thought that if the tax is re
pealed it" would result in benefit to tbe
borrowers, as the savings banks will give
borrowers the benefit of the change and
tbe difference would be equal to the tax.
Charles O. King of Ban Luis Obispo read
DR. WILLIAM DOHRMANN and MISS CRISSIE SIEBE,
Who Will Be Married This Evening at the Bride's Resi
dence on Sacramento Street Miss Siebe Is the Daughter
of Assessor Siebe and Dr. Dohrmann Is the Son of Presi
dent Dohrmann of the Merchants' Association.
a paper on the "Advantage of Member
ship in Building and Loan Associations."
Secretary Naylor read a paper on "Con
tingent Fund," and explained why and
how such a fund should bÂ« maintained.
James L. Fields read a long paper on
"Premium Plan*, Division of Profits and
Cost of a Loan," in which he entered into
a minute and technical discussion of sub
jects whicti require'a thorough knowledge
of the methods of loan associations to ap
preciate.
Frank V. "Wriehtof San Jose, past presi
dent and a member of the executive com
mittee and at present secretary of t; c San
Jose Building and Loan Association, read
a paper on "Matured Shares." He sug
gested a policy which will aid in increas
ing the loaning and earning powers of tbe
association, rather than allowing its entire
force to be absorbed and assuredly les
sened by the unnecessary disbursement of
funds for the payment of matured stock.
He suggested tne listing, in order of ap
plication, the names of the holders of
matured stock who are desirous of obtain
ing their money, and will accent a dis
count from the par value when cashed.
These may be paid out of the one-third
monthly receipts of the funds of the asso
ciation together with such rate of interest
ias may be determined until paid. Any
j shares remaining on the books of the cor-
I poration at the annual appropriation of
profits should receive their additional pro
rata of earnings. The shareholder who
i desires to allow his matured stock to re
-1 main with the association may receive
quarterly interest at say 6 per cent per
annum and also distribution in the form
of a dividend.
The committee recommended the adop
tion of a resolution asking the Legislature
to continue the commission at the expense
of the State and one that ail associations
in California create a contingent fund in
keeping with euch conditions. These
were adopted.
Fremont Wood and Albert Meyer read
papers in which they suggested means to
: treat delinquents.
George A. Fisher, one of the Building
! and Loan Commissioners, delivered a
I short address comÂ«nendinsr the good work
j the league has done. Mr. Fisher did not
think it wise to a^k the State to pay the
cost of the commission, as the amount,
only 25 cents a share in ten years, is too
small.
Tne last paper was by C. K. ClarK on I
"Uniform Methods" in conducting the
business of the offices under tbe several
rules in vozie.
Messrs. Clark, Wood, Naylor, Wright
and Sbarboro were appointed a committee
to present a report at the next meeting on
the best rule for conducting the affairs of
associations.
The following officers were re-elected for
the ensuing year: Frank Otis, president ;
Albert Meyer, first vice-president; James
L. Fields, second vice-president; Charles
JO King, third vice-president; Charles Â£.
i Xaylor, secretary; B. Harris, treasurer.
BIG FEES DEMANDED
Attorneys for the Estate of Hi
ram A. Pearsons Ask for
$37>500.
Judge C ff;y Inclined to Believe the
Compensation Is Out of
Proportion
"It was once a theory," said Attorney
Haight in Judge Coffey's court yesterday,
"tnat an estate was for the benefit of the
heirs, but now it seems to be thought that
the estate is for the lawyers." This sar
castic shaft was aimed at Joseph H. Moore
and Thomas F. Barry, the legal represent
atives of the executor of the estate of Hi
ram A. Pearsons. Messrs. Moore and Barry
had just presented a request for payment
for their services in brhalf of the estate,
and the former had modestly demanded
$25,000, while Mr. Barry had announced
that he would be content with half that
sum.
Judge Coffey took a hand in the contro
versy and remarked that the matter of
fees was something that gave him more
trouble than anyone thiug in the business
of hia department. He said that the pay
ment demanded by Mr. Moore was, to say
the least, the largest ever asked during his
experience for Bimiiar service under similar
circumsta/ices. He also bad a word for
tne lawyers representing tbe heirs, want
ing to know why the protection of the es
tate was left entirely to tbe court, and
why they did not speak out in behalf of
their clients.
Tbe Pearsons estate has been in the
courts for over six years, Hiram A. Pear
sons having been drowned in Lake Michi
gan in 1889. He left real estate in this
City valued at almost $500,000, a portion
of which was bo!u to get money to pay be
quests made in Pearsons' will. As it now
stands the estate is worth $393,953 95.
Besides the $25,000 now asked Mr. Moore
ha* already received from the executor in
payment for services rendered $6960 and
Mr. Biirry has had $5000.
His Honor, in looking over the account
handed in, has already discovered a mis
take of $1240, made by computing the ad
ministrator's commissions wrongly. He
has taken the entire matter of fees under
consideration.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1896.
JUDGE HEBBARD'S
RIGHT TO VOTE
He Denies That He Is Not
a United States
Citizen.
Although Born in Canada He
Did Not Need to Ec
Naturalized.
HIS ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE.
Laws of the Country Quoted ia Sup
port of His Honor's Claim to
Citizenship.
In reply to an article published in a
morning paper, in which it is claimed that
Judge Hebbard is not a citizen of the
United States, his Honor has given a de
tailed history of bis family for several
generations back, and explained his claim
to citizenship.
Judge Hebbard's family, be gays, on
both sides, are and have been Americans,
in every sense of the term,, ever since their
Puritan fathers landed on Plymouth
Rock. Upon his mother's side he traces
his descent back to Roger Williams.
Upon bis father's side he is a descendant
of the French Huguenots. Timothy Heb
bard, his great-grand father, was born and
resided at Royalton, Vt.
At the time of the birth of Judge Heb
bard's father in 1824, there existed upon
the statute boots of the United States the
following act, approved Adhl 14, 1802
(2 U. S. statutes at large, page 155), which
provides as follows:
Section 4. And be it further enacted, that
the children of persona duly naturalized
under any of the laws of the United Slates, or
who, previous of trie passing of any law on
that subject, by tho Government of the United
States, may have become citizens of any one of
the sÂ».ld States, under tbe laws thereof, being
under the age of 21 years, at the time of their
parents being .-o naturalized or admitted to
the r ghts of citizenship, shall, if dweilirg in
the United States, be considered as citizaus of
the United States, and the children of persons
who now are or have been citizens of the
Cnited States, shall, though born out of the
limits and jurisdiction of tne United States, be
considered as citizens of the United States;
provided, also, that no person heretofore pro
scribed by any Stale, or who has been legally
convicted of having joined the army of Great
Britain, during tne late war, shall be admitted
a citizen as aforesaid, without the cousent of
the Leg.slaturc of the State in whicti such per
son was proscribed.
Section 5. And be it further enacted, that
all acts heretofore passed respecting naturali
zation be and the same are hereby repealed.
At tbis time, therefore, Judge Hebtoard's
father ur.der this law, immediately upon
his birth, acquired the status of a citizen
of the Unite-; States and consistently with
that statu* after his arrival in California,
and about 1867 or lE6B, he became a regisl
tered voter in Nevada County, having been
I advised as to nis rights by the Hon. Ad
dison C. Niles, late Justice of the Supreme
Court of the State of California.
Judge HebDard himself was born in Can
ada April 11. 1854. At the time of his
birth the act just quoted was in force
and conferred upon him the status of
American citizenship.
Upon his arrival at his majority in 1875
he applied for letters of citizenship, not
understanding at that time mat he was
?. ready a citizen. The omcer having in
c.arge the registration of voters in San
Mateo County, upon the narration of the
ioregoing facts, advised him that he was>
already a citizen, and that he had but to
register to vote, and that nothing but reg
istration was neoessary to entitle him to
vote. Judge Hebbard thereupon regis
tered and cast his first vote at that time.
During the twenty-one years that have
elapsed since then Judge Hebbard has
registered and voted at every election in
this State, either in San Mateo County or
the City and County of Ban Francisco, ex
cept twice, when temporarily absent from
the Btate of California.
This question of his citizenship is not a
new one. In 1879 when Judge Hebbard
was a candidate Jor Superior Judee in San
Mateo County the same question was
raised and disposed of. In 1890 when be
was a candidate for Judge of the Superior
Court in San Francisco the same question
was aeain raised and disposed of. The
question is now raised for the thud time.
NO MEETING WAS HELD.
Ocean View Republicans Indignant Over
tbe Publication of a False
Statement.
The effort of certain interested parties
in the Ocean View District to cause trouble
am one the loyal Republicans of that sec
tion has caused much indignation and
efforts are being made to discover the
author of a number of false stories that
have been circulated.
The latest canard published relates that
on Friday night last a meeting of tho
Farallon Non-Partisan Club, a mythical
organization, was held at Murphy's Hall
and that 200 members acted on certain
matters.
The names of B. Murphy and J. Pen
dergas are mentioned as officers of the or
ganization, the names of the other officers
being unknown in Ocean View.
Both Murphy and Pendercas are known
to be stanch Republicans and members
of the Ocean View McKinley and Hobart
Ciub, and the former, who owns tbe hail
where the meeting is altered to hare taken
place, denies that there was any such
gathering or that he ever was identified
with any such movement.
MR. PHELAN AMONG
HIS OLD FRIENDS
Spoke Within Half a Block
of His Birthplace
and Home.
Municipal Affairs Ought to Be
Conducted on Business
Principles.
FREE WATER FOR THE CITY.
That Is One of the Reforms That
Ought to Be Accomplished.
Other Economies.
James D. Phelan, nominee for Mayor on
the regular Democratic ticket, addressed
an enthusiastic meeting at Native Sons'
Hall, on Seventeenth street, near Valen
cia, last night. A goodly number of ladies
were present, and they joined heartily in
the cordial reception that was tendered to
Mr. Phelan.
As the hall where he spoke is within
half a block from the spot where Mr. Phe
lan was born and where he has lived ail
his life the greeting that was given par
took more of the nature of a neighborly
reunion than a political demonstration.
The hall was handsomely decorated,
Mr. Pheian's pictuie being conspicuously
displayed in front of the speaker's stand.
A. L. Mann called the meeting to order
and presented Daniel O'Callaghan as the
chairman oi the evening, who introduced
Mr. Phelan.
Taking for bis theme the need of the
municipal government Mr. Pbelan re
fen ed to the fact that he had lived in the
Mission all his life. He felt that heie he
was among friends and neighbors, and it
was a pleasure to be with bo many with
whom his life had been spent.
The nomination for Mayor by tbe Dem
ocratic party, Mr. Phelan said, had been
tendered to him without his solicitation,
and subsequently the Non-Partisans had
ottered their indorsement. Wishing to do
som e eeryice lor the people of San Fran
cisco, his native City, he had accepted she
nomination, and now he was doing his
duty by poing forth to meet the electors
and confer with them in regard to the
issues of the campaign.
Mr. Phelan contended that he stood as
the nominee of tne Democratic party of
San Francisco, whereas the man who is
the figurehead at the top of the other so
called Democratic ticket is simply the
representative of a foul and vicious boss,
who in times past was compelled to tiee
tie country, pursued by the officers of the
law. It would be a sharae and a disgrace,
Mr. Phelan said, to allow any man wiiO is
tainted with tbe support of Boss Buckley
and bound to him by political ties to win
in a contest like this.
National politics and National themes,
Mr. Phelan said, are eood for the orators,
but wi.en it comes to every day practical
affairs tbe people are more interested in
the management of the municipal covern
ment than in the general principles that
some people talk so mum about. For in
stance, the City pays $350,000 for water for
fire purposes, when everybody knows that
no such amount of water is used by the
City. That mucb water could not be used
unless we had five fire department* as big
as the one we now have. This could be cut
down, and it ouarht to be done.
In tbis regard Mr. Phelan desired to re
ply to an article in a morning paper which
iiad anceested that he would not make a
good Mayor because he had not had ex
perience in municipal nffairs. He ap
pealed to his hearers as citizens to say
whether they did not know of evils in the
municipal government and whether they
did not believe that he would know
enough about business to correct the
abuses, concerning which the peonle
rightly complain. [Applause.] Mr.
Phelan continued:
It is outrageous that the City should have to
pay so many thousands of dollars for water
and light when these ought to be supplied free
of charge in part payment for the franchises
that have been so freely given to the corpora
tions.
Golden Gate Park costs the City thousands of
dollars every year. Those who go out to the
park will find that all the railroad lines con
verge there, and it would appear to an un
biased observer that the park was a grand
scheme got up to help Bwell the receipts of the
street railroads. Yet these railroads have
never been called on to help .support the park ;
and they wouldn't do it if so requested.
[Laughter and applause.]
In recent years a new force has made its ap
pearance in our civilization. The wheel hns
come to stay, and everywhere wheelmen are
for progess. They are for good s;reets and
they are right, for in a great desrree a city's
prosperity depends on the excellency of its
thoroughfares. [Applause.l The bicycle is in
some measure supplanting other methods of
transportation. It costs nothing for its keep
ing, and in addition to freeing the man from
ordinary restraints of travel, it adds to his
health and strength as well as giving a pleas
ing divers ion. In all these effects the wheel
is a benefit to tbe community and must bo
so recognized by public-spirited citizens.
The wheel is proving of pract cal benefit by
making the suburbs more accessible to the
businessman. It brings the shr.p of the artisan
closer to his home and opens up opportunities
that ne never enjoyed before. As a conse
quence the outlying districts are becoming
more presentable because the wheelmen insist
that they shnll be put in condition tor the
bicycle. This is a direct benefit to the entire
community.
The Mission is feeMng the effect of this in
fluence for good iv a marked degree. Our
people are demanding and obtaining better
streets, and will soon have a beautiful park
and a spacous High School buildiug. [Ap
plause and cheers.]
These improvements and others that are
bound to come will draw population to our
City; will draw people from Oakland, San
Rafael, Sausalito ana other bay cities, besides
attracting the residents of the interior to the
City. In this we will be but Retting our own, as
we shall call back hundreds, or even thousands,
who have imperceptibly drifted away to other
localities, because wa have not made the best
of our opportunities.
It pays a city to have its affairs conducted on
business principles, because then the revenue
of the municipal government may be ex
pended for the improvement and embellisli
ment of the streets and parks and public build
ings. If chosen as Mayor of San Francisco, I
shall attempt to have some of these good
things put iv force. [Applause.]
In conclusion, Mr. Phelan said that be
aspired to berve the City in which he was
born, and that he hoped by the âºuffrages
of his fellow-citizens to be put in such a
position that he may be the humble means
of helping San Francisco to realize her
dream of prosper. tv. Sitting here by the
Golden Gate, our City has a right to ex
pect the grandest destiny of any city on
the continent, and he will at all times be
ready to contribute his share in working
out and fulfilling that destiny,
Mr. Pheian's remarks were well received
by his hearers, and at tho close of his
speecfi he was repaid by applause and a
round of cheers.
William Broderick, Democratic nominee
for Auditor, said he wanted to epeak a
word for Mr. Phelan.
It was true that Mr. Phelan had not had
any experience in municipal government,
but according to Mr. Broderick's opinion,
Mr. Taylor and Mr. Dimond had not had
any more, so far as practical affairs go,
since he said they had not accomplished a
single thine during their two years in
office. Mr. Dimond, he said, had not been
In a position to do anything, and nad not
tried to worry the majority into doing
right. As to Mr. Taylor, that gentleman,
he declared, | although chairman of the
Supervisors' Finance Committee, had not
cut off a nickel from the exorbitant bills
of rapacious contractors for the past
twenty months.

is made â  especially for such cases. It never fails ;to kindle ; the
fires anew. All; the flush of youth is renewed when it is worn ;
life assumes a happier state, and the joy born of magnetic force
shines in the eye. \ ** , - f . '
L. L. Jaccard, the San Leandro jeweler, who was cured by ;
Dr. Sand en's Electric Belt winter, is a fair specimen of what
this wonderful Belt does. He is a magnificent specimen of man-
hood and at fifty years of; age has the physique and air of a
young man. He says, " I believe that I am stronger than any
other man of ;my age. I am as light on my feet as when I was
twenty." â  'â  : :>; -â â â ,'â "â â  : ..-. /iv { - ' . * : ' "' ;: - .â 
" It is not claimed that this famous Belt will make an old man
young, but it will make an old man forget : his years, and those
thousands of young men who " feel old it will " make : feel young
again. r Everything it does is based .on the renewal of nerve
force that has been wasted by excesses or otherwise. It will do
this. Do you need it ? ' '

NEW lOBK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 20.â The stock mar
ket to-day was strong almost from the opening
to the close of the session. The dea ings, while
not especially large, aggregating only 223,500
shares, were well distributed, and, with a very few
exceptions, higher prices were recorded all along
the line. The main causes for the Improvement
were the engagement of over 85,000,000 in Lon
don to-day for shipment to this side and the fac:
that sterling exchange ruled barely steady, thus
Indicating renewed imports of the yellow metal in
the near future.
. Quite as important as the foregoing in its bear
ine upon stock values was the continued foreign
demand for our breadstuff t and cotton, and the
news from the west thai the railroads of the West
are taxed to the utmost to carry the grain now
moving. In fact, advices were to the effect that a
car famine is in prospect On all this the bulls
lifted ices with a ;.ood deal of confidence, and
succeeded in forcing latent short interests into cov
ering. â¢ Although Chicago Gas came, second in
point ofactivitv.it s oied the greatest advance,
namely, 4V4 points, to 65s/ 8 . The rise nas due to
purcna-es oy those who claim to have political
news from Illinois more favorable to . the future
Interests of the company. â¢- - â¢ -

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO. lii.. Oct. 20.â Affairs were not so
propitious for the wheat bulls this morning, which,
however, did not destroy all confidence in yet bet
ter pri es. But when fractions are constantly
dropped from quotations it requires beilevers in an
advance to draw on their reserve funds of faith for
encouragement. This was the situation early
to-day. Liverpool cables were far from buoyant,
while continental markets did nothing more than
keep in line with our figures. Quite a little long
wheat was sold to-day, the demaud being quite
tame as compared with the furor of yesterday.
Receipts in the > orthwest were 15. 7 cars,
against 1433 last Tuesday and 1436 a year ago.
Chicago received 277 cars ana inspec.ed out 10,000
bushels. Export clearances amounted to 49 ,7-5
bushels. Brad.-treet's report on the world's s ock
was not Issued to-day. The market Improved
later in the session on reported sales for export to
Lisbon and on the importation Of .Â» 5.000. jOO in
gold. Quite a flurry occurred during the closing
moments when an advance of 3^gc from the In
side was recorded. December wheat opened from
77% to 7fcVi. sold be weeu 78% and 755/ a . closing
at 78*/gC, Ie higher than yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow, 312 cars.
COR*â That tne sentiment which obtained in
wheat during the past week or ten days -has had
no permane . 1 influence on corn was evidenced by
the direction taken by the latter in the immediate
start today. Prices in this market are tardy to
advance, with, but show readiness to participate In
ihÂ» weakness of the leading market. Liverpool
cables were quiet and steady. Receipts were 937
cars, and 676.731 bushels were taken from store.
Exports amounted to 677,711 bushels. A.s'.i.bt
rally took pace toward he close. May corn
opened at 29v 2 c, declined to *8V4@28%c, closing
at 29 Vic, Vie .under yesterday, intimated re
ceipts for to-morrow, 910 cars.
OAT-i-Thr action o. oats was not a matter of
individual merit or inclination, but rather de
pended on whether the other grains were weak or
strong. As the former tone predominated else
where, so did it In oats. Receipts were 495 cars,
and 39.800 bushel* were ' taken from sto A
fair recovery was noted near the c ose. May oats
cloaed unchanged. Est. mated receipts tor to
morrow, 410 cars.
FLAXâ Was easier. Cash, 7Â»374^c: December,
75(377^c; May, BU^@B3V^c. Receipts were 115
cars.
PROVISIONSâ Product was quiet, generally
s;eak mi:, and In response to a lower hog market
exhibited a teudenc- to sag. The bulge in wheat
late in the seas. on helped prices of provisions a
trifle. January pork closed 7 Vie lower, January
lard and r-bs . aeh 2 Vie lower.

WAS THE CAUSE
Wreck of a Large Reservoir
Built of Masonry on
Vernon Heights.
W. J. Dingee Declares It Was
Blown Up by an Evil-
Minded Person.
ADVENTURES WITH A FLOOD.
Much Damage Caused by the Rush
ing of the Torrent Down the
Hillside.
Oakland Office Sas Feancisco Call,)
90S Broadway, Oct. 20. J
The big reservoir owned by the Oakland
Water Company was destroyed this morn
ing. President Dingee believes that dyna
mite was used to wreck a portion of his
plant. Some are of the opinion that the
pressnre of the volume of water burst out
the foundation, but Mr. Dingee denies that
yuch could possibly be.
About 6:30 o'clock this morning the res
idents on Vernon Heights were startled
by an explosion, which they compare to
the noise of a thunderclap. About fifty
feet froom the reservoir to the north is the
residence of AI Wood. Mrs. Wood was
aroused by the noise and on looking out
of a window she saw a great mass of water
rushing toward the house. She called to
her husband to run for his life, but before
they could take any steps the water was
deflected and rushed through the yard,
completely wrecking walls and sheds. The
brick Dulkhead was carried almost bodily
to the foot of the hill, although some of
the pieces of masonry weighed 400 pounds.
Sidewalks were swept away and much
damage was done to gardens and houses.
The whole 10,000,000 gallons of water were
liberated aud ten minutes after the ex
plosion the great reservoir was empty.
The solid masonry of the reservoir was
thrown in all directions and large masses
of concrete were found a distance of many
yards from the break.
Mrs. J. A. Johnson, at 74 Wndsworth
avenue, was much frightened. Her hus
band is connected witn the United States
survey steamer McArthur, and she was
alone in the house with three small chi'd
dren. She says she heard a sound like
that of a big tire. When she locked from
the window she saw a great flood of water
rush down upon her house.
She gathered her children together and
hurried to the front door. When she was
on the porch she saw that her house was
entirely surrounded by water. She could
not escape from the rushing waters, and
she feared her house might be beaten
down by the floating wooden sidewalks
that were carried against the structure by
the flood.
W. J. Dingee, president of the water
company, made an inspection of the
wreck, and, after interviewing some of the
residents, he said he believed the reservoir
had been wrecked by some evil-di- posed
person.
"â¢* believe that that wall was blown up
snd my reasons for so believing are that
persons in the vicinity heard two distinct
explosions and besides it wa^ a physical
impossibility for that concrete wall two
feet thick to give way under the pressure
of water that was then upon it," said Mr.
Dingee. "The water was only two ieet
above ihe surface when the break oc
curred, wnereas we have had it clear up
to the top, which is seven fe -t from the
surface. This portion of the reservoir has
been in use four months and has never
shown any signs of weakness.
"The lowei portion of the reservoir has
been in use for a couple of years. A por
tion of this wall near the corner was also
destroyed. This was strengthened by
wire cables, one and one-half inches iv
diameter, which were imbedded in the
asphalt concrete, of which the walls were
composed. These cables ran back thirty
or forty feet from the corners. Notwith
standing their size and strength they were
broken, and this, I think, is anoiher evi
dence that some explosive was used to
cause this big break.
"As to who would be guilty of such a
dastardly act as this, I would not care to
say. I can only surmise. I know that it
cannot be any one of the great body of
people of Oakland who have been benefited
by the competition of the water com
panies. However, this affair is in keeping
with the blowing up of our water-maia in
East Oakland on July 4 of lust year."
WILL NOT WED A MARQUIS
The Ardent Lover of General
Beauharnais Sent to

She Declares Her Scn-in-Law's Anxiety

the Trouble.
Oaslawd Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 20. f
Mrs. Virginia Coonradt, the widow, who
made all necessary arrangements for her
wedding witn Marquis de Beauharnais at
the Girard Hotel last week and invited a
number of friends to the affair without
having consulted the Marquis, was de
clared insane by the Lunacy Commission
era this afternoon. She was ordered con
fined at the Stockton Asylum.
At the time ot her peculiar actions the
family decided to have her mental condi
tion inquired into, but she found it out
and left before they could detain her. She
was arrested at the Hotel Alexander in
San Francisco yesterday and was brought
to the county jail to await the examina
tion. She charges her son-in-law with
wanting to put her out of the way so as to
secure her property.
"The whole trouble," said she, "is on
account of the house I own at Piedmont
Heights. Frank Ely wants it, having
lived there over four years and only paid
160 rent. It wan agreed when be moved in
he should pay me $12 a month and sive
me my room and board. I was not going
to marry Mr. de Beauharnais, although we
love each other dearly. The preparations
at the hotel were not for a wedding, but a
party. I only said we were to be married
as a joke."
Robbed of Jewels.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 20. â A robbery
committed last July has been reported to
the police and a reward of $100 offered for
the recovery of the articles taken. Sus
picion pointed to a member of the house

the houie decided to locate the thief, but
failed, and at this late date appeals to the
police. There is little hope of recovering
the articles or catching the thief.

OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 20. â The new
track at the Oakland Trotting Park, as
made over by the California Jockey Club,
at Emeryville, gives indications of being
very fast. It is yet somewhat hard, but
the horsemen predict that records will be
broken on the opening day next Saturday.
A half dozen horses have marked a half
mile in 50 seconds, several have made the
three-quarters in 1:15 and a number have
made the mile in 1:44.
Superintendent Allen is taking advan
tage of the postponement of the opening
to put the finishing touches on the grand
stand, paddock and fences.
The field within the track is being lev
eled and seeded with bluegrass. There
are twelve starting-gates being erected and
tested along the course for the different
distances. The bettinp-ring and boxes,
poolrooms and bookmakers' rooms are all
oompleted and ready for use Saturday. .
A Challenge to Debate.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct 20.â The Army

a challenge to the Army and Navy Repub
lican League for a debate upon the cur
rency question. The challenge has been
accepted and the meeting will occur next
week at the Exposition Hall.
Efforts are being made to have a debate
arranged between the Republican warrior
ex-Mayor William R. Davis and the
Populist leader, Green Majors of Ala
meda. The Republicans would be willing
to put Mr. Davis forward to meet any
Democrat or Populist in joint debate.

Moses A. Jackson, an old colored man,
known on both sides of the bay as "Stone-
Stonewall Jackson, Who Died Yes

wall" Jackson, died last night in West
Oakland. Old Moses lived 104 years.
While there were still a few years left of
the last century Moses Jackson was born
at Baltimore, Md. He was never a slave,
and this fact was often related with great
pride by the old negro. He came to Cali
fornia in 1851 and has lived at Sacramento,
Marysville and San .Francisco before com
ine to Oakland. For a great part of his
life he has conducted an employment bu
reau, and for many years he furnished the
leading families of the State with their
colored help.
On his list of patrons was Senator Stan
ford, and ola Moses used to speak in very
familiar terms with the ex-president of
the Southern Pacific.
Moses married about eighty years ago
and has been a widower for nearly half a
century. He used to say that one wife was
enough for one lifetime and he ever re
mained true to the memory of his first
wife.
Only two weeke' illness preceded his
death. Previous to that he was a strong,
healthy man, and straight as a man of
40. He leaves two sons and two daughters,
all of whom are married and have grand
children.

Surprise for Gov

With a Very Cool
Reception.
ALL DEMOCRATS OUT OF TOWN
They Were to Be in Livermore When

Be in Oakland.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, I
9UB Brpadway, Oct. 20. f
' The harmony that the fusionists of
Alameda County prate and dream about
is of the same kind that has characterszed
Ihe Democratic party for years. It is of !
the genuine cat-and-dos variety. There j
ia only a plaster partition between the !
County Committee-rooms of the two
Darties on Broadway, but there is a wider
breach between the feelings of some of the
wings of the fusion bird.
The latest exhibition of "harmony" is
an attempt made by the silver wins of
the Democracy to spoil the effect of the
parade that will take place next (Saturday
night in honor of the visit of Governor
Budd. Frank J. Moflitt is credited with
creating the present trouble, but his
friends say it is all a mistake and in a
spirit of magnanimity Con Brosnahan, j
chairman of the Democratic County Cen- J
tral Committee, said toÂ»night that Mr.
Motfitt might not have known that Gov
ernor Budd was to have been in Oakland |
next Saturday when making his arrange
ments to take the Populist Zouaves by
special train to Livermore on the same j
night to escort G. W. Baker, the railroad â 
attorney and silver Republican.
A few days ago G. W. Buttner, manager
of the Zouaves, received a message from j
the Silver Committee in Ban Francisco I
that he was wanted. Buttner went over !
and met Mr. Moffitt, who wa3 planning for j
a big silver rally at Livermore next Satur
day night.
Manager Buttner was told that the sil
ver people had put up liberally for uni
forms and expenses and would provide a
special train on which the Zouaves could
go and surprise the pr ople of Livermore.
Mr. Buttner approved of the plan ana on
his return to Oakland he told Chairman
Brosnahan of the trip.
Then Mr. Brosnahan did some thinking. !
He knew that Governor Budd was to be in j
Oakland Saturday night, and that as ereat !
a show as possible was desired to con- j
vince Mr. Budd that though all the world
should desire McKinley and honesty Ala
meda County still is loyal to the forlorn
hope. He knew also that Moffitt had been
& very pronounced Murphy man and had
uo use for Budd.
The Populist ZouayeÃ beine the most
gaudy and attractive of all the fusion uni
formed clubs, and its fife corps being quite
a power, might it not be possible thai Mr.
Moffitt had as usual seen a little ahead of
the men with whom he had to deal and
had planned that Livermore meeting to
spoil the Oakland parade and humiliate
Budd?
Chairman Brosnahan heartily expressed
his disapproval of the Zouave parade at
Liverraore, and Manager Buttner declared
the Livermore project off. Mr. Brosnahan
also, it is reported, said something about
a Populist uniformed club going on a
special train to boom a railroad attorney's
lecture on silver.
Now it is openly stated that Frank J.
Moffitt has graduated from the small
arena of Alameda County Democratic
politics and is now a State politician, and
would like to see the ifitzgerald-Brosna
han wing humiliated.
The fusionists consider that they have
been saved from a very neatly laid trap to
spoil their "monster demonstration," and
are congratulating themselves that they
were rescued in time.
"We are going to do great things next
Saturday night, said Chairman Brosna
han to-night, "and I don't intend to let
any one spoil it. Perhaps Mr. Moffitt had
forgotten Governor Budd's meeting, as he
is so busily engaged on tho silver com
mittee."
The extent of Mr. Moffitt's forgetful
ness was farther reaching than appeared
on the surfaced/or it seems that the gayly
uniformed People's party Zouaves were
not the only organization wearing uni
forms upon which he had cast longing
eyes. After the expose by the Zouave
chief, it was learned that Mr. Moffitt had
drawn two other clubs into his Livermore
silver-meeting project. Rumor has it that
after visiting the silver headquarters in
San Francisco he returned with a well
filled sack. Out of this, so the story goes,
he took $200, which he handed over* to the
Young Men's Democratic Club, it being
well understood that the club would turn
out in goodly numbers and in full uniform.
Again the liberal hund of Mr. Mottitt
went into the sack, and in a short time
$ 150 was transferred to the Army and Navy
Bryan Club, with the same understanding.
Since this leaked out, however much truth
there is in the tale, the Populist Zonaves
are well pleased that they did not agree to
do for "harmony" and "loyalty" what the
other uniform clubs were well paid for.
No sooner did the Young Men's Demo
cratic Clab and the Army and Navy Bryan
Club learn of the apparent "forgetfulness"
of Mr. Moffltt, than both organizations de
clared that they would not co to Liver-
J more on the railroad's free train, to keux,
the railroad attorney talk about free silver.
As may be expected, this expose of Mr.
Moffitt's absent-mindedness has caused a
great deal of talk in Oakland Democratic
circles, and the end of the talk is not yet
reached.

BERKELEY, ual., Oct. 20.â Little John
McLeod, the 3-year-old son of J. M. Me-
Leod, an expressman of D wight- way
station, was run over by a sprinkling cart,
driven by Frank M. Jones, this afternoon,
and was so seriously injured that ~he died
a few minutes after the occurrence of the
accident. 'One of the front wheels of the
wagon ran over the little boy's chest and
shoulder, completely crushing â  the ' bones
and lacerating the flesh in a horrible
manner. He was immediately carried into
his home, which was but a few steps off,
and three physicians were summoned, but
their efforts to save bis life were unavail
ing../. ' â¢â / ". /-â  â .;â ââ . â  ..â  â â â ;.:-' : -'
The general opinion among the eye
witnesses to the tragedy is that it was
purely accidental. . Some think more pre
caution might have been taken on the
part :of I the '.; driver. :It see ms that \ the
child was playing in the : middle of the
street ' when the 2 cart approached, ; and
being unaware of the impending danger,
run in front ; of the wagon between the
horses and the ''. front wneel. The , driver
says he did not see the little one until it
was too late. . . . â  ',
Jones offered to give himself up to the
authorities, but Marshal- Lloyd; believing
that the case was accidental, allowed the"
driver to go* on his own recognizance. An
inquest will be held at 4 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon.

BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. ; 2o.â The Cres

The gymnasium, apparatus and fixtures
were turned ' over *to ; the West Berkeley

For a long time past a dissolution has
been imminent, because of internal , dis
sension and lack of support by its mem
bers. The prize-ring contests which were
recently, held â¢ under : the auspices ;of ; the
club, and : the unfavorable comment
caused by them through the local pulpits,
are also said to have had something to do
with 1 the disbanding. , ;
The club was organized about two and
a half years ago, and, for about a year and
a half jit was in a nourishing condition,
having at , the height, of its prosperity,
about 150 members. i : : - -â 'â ..â¢ ?
It seemed , at ; ' one time . that \ nothing

ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 20. -Mrs. Wil
liam Wahmuth, the young wife of a
wealthy young man, was found dead in a
room at her residence at 1218 Broadway
to-night under circumstances that leave
no doubt as to its being a case of suicide.
Mrs. Wahmuth lived in the house with
the family of her husband, and there is
no reason for her act that can be advanced
by any of the relatives, except despond
ency due to ill health.
Mr. and Mrs. Wahmuth were married
on the 21st of last June and consequently
have not yet completed four months of
wedded life when the young husband finds
himself a widower. During the brief
period since their wedding day their life
has been one of the greatest happiness.
The only thing that troubled Mrs. Wah
muth was her ill health. For many years
she has not enjoyed good health and since
her marriage it has not improved. This
made the young wife somewhat despond
ent, but she never complained, although
she frequently expressed a wish that she
might be stronger.
Nothing that has transpired during the
past few days led her relatives to suppose
that she was feeling any more despondent
or brooding over her troubles any more
than usual.
This afternoon her husband and the
other members of the family went to San
Francisco leaving Mrs. Wahrnuth in the
house alone. Wtien they took their de
parture she seemed quite cheerful. They
returned at 7 o'clock to-night and on going
into the house found a strong smell of
gas.
Mrs. Wahmuth could not be found, but
the source of the gas seemed to be in a
little room which she frequently used.
The door was tried, but it had evidently
been fastened and force was required to
Open it.
When an entrance was gained Mrs.
Wahmuth was found on the lounge in
an unconscious condition. Medical aid
was summoned and every means possible
was resorted to to restore animation but
without effect, and late to-night she died
without regaining consciousness.
There was heart-rending mourning in
the beautiful home to-night and the
young husband's grief was almost uncon
trollable. He said that for the past two
months his wife's health had not been so
good as usual, but she never gave any
indication that she contemplated suicide
or she would never have been left alone.
A Price Upon His Head.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 20.â The County
Jail contains a self-confessed exile, who
will meet the executioner's ax should he
return to his native heath. Ah Sam, who ia
awciting trial for the assault he made
upon Ah Finn in the rear of a Chinese
laundry at the West end last month, ad
mits that a price has been placed upon
his head by the officials of the flowery
kingdom as a result of his former life as a
pirate.
Ah Sam says he is a descendent of the
Chinese nobility, but that he was made
the black sheep of the family.
As he is positively identified by Ah Finn
as his assailant, Ah Bam does not have a
very bright future to look forward to.
A New Paper.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 20.â Among the
possibilities of the near future is another
first-class newspaper for this city. An op
tion upon a double-cylinder perfecting
press and stereotyping outfit has already
been taken by persons who are now look
ing for a suitable type-setting machine.
Nothing definite as to its policy or man
agement could be gained from those act
ing in the matter until something more
had been accomplished.
Editor Darnells of the Argus said in re
eard to affairs generally: "If some one
with money and experience would start a
morning paper here it would be a good
thing. lam sure they would be well sup
ported and make money out of it."

SACRED HEART FAIR.
It Closed I.ast Night, a Social and
Financial Success.
The Catholic fair in the First Regiment
Armory has been a grand success.' Its
purpose was to raise money for the new
Sacred Heart Church that is to be erected
on the corner of Fill more and Fell streets.
The fair opened on the Ist inst. and closed
last evening. It has been under the
management of Father Flood, M. Cooney,
Dr. Thomas Bodkin and J. C. Nealon.
The management expect to clear $10,000
over and above all expenses, a very neat
sum to help make up the $70,000 that the
church will cost.
Every one who has had anything to do
with the festival has spared no pains to
make it a success. Among these the
ladies of the icecream booth â Miss Annie
O'Brien, Miss Dora Moran, Miss May
O'Brien, Mrs. T. Furlong and Miss Kittie
Dalton â have added much to the revenue
by their efforts.
The Daily Record, which was issued
during the fair, was to have ceased pub
lication wiien the fair closed, but it has
been decided to keep it alive as the
Weekly Record. X. J. O'Neill, the editor,
intends to make it a spicy paper, filled
with all the Catholic news of the various
parishes.
Last evening all of the articles on which
tickets were issued were raffled, and the
articles on which no tickets were issued
were sola at auction. After the business
features of the festival the floor was cleared
and young and old enjoyed a social dance
that lasted well into the night. Thus
closed one of the most successful festivals
of the season.

CLUBMEN ARE HOPEFUL
Bright Prospects for the New
Pacific â  Union Home on
Van Ness Avenue.
Special Committee of Influential Hen
Has the Enterprise in
Hand.
At the Pacific â¢ Union Club yesterday
there was a meeting of a committee ap
pointed to raise funds to carry out the
proposition to buy land and fuild a new
clubhouse on Van Ness avenue. Ie
was attended by members of ample means
and large influence, and the utmost confi
dence is expressed in the ability of these
men to place Donds to the extent of $325,
--000.
The report goes that the directors of the
club who were authorized to place the
bonds did not succeed as wel oa many
members of the institution desired. Hence
a special committee was named to take
the project in hand.
Claus Spreckels, chairman of the com
mittee, presided at the meeting yesterday.
Adam Grant, Â£. 8. Pillsbury and many
others attended the session.
It is the impression now that the com
mittee will place the matter in such a light
before the wealthy and progressive mem
bers of the club that all the bonds required
will be taken with little delay. The di
rectors recognize the force of Mr. Spreckels'
ability and influence in measures of this
character, and do not doubt his success.
Some time next week a general meeting
of the club members will be held to hear
the report of the special committee.
The prediction was made last night by
men familiar with the customs of the
Pacific-Union that within two rears the
club will own and occupy on Van Ness
avenue one of the finest clubhouses in the
United States.
The membership of the Pacific-Union
represents a vast deal of wealth, but it is a
conservative body and acts with measured
judgment.
Should the club resolve to move, as now
seems highly probable, all the members
will join in an effort to hasten the com
pletion of the new edifice. In point of
style and architecture the new home of
the Pacific-Union will be an ornament to
San Francisco. The proposed ladies' an
nex is a feature that commends the enter
prise to many clubmen.
Cruelty to s Baby.
David Fleming and his wife Mary were ar
rested yesterday afternoon by Officers Hol
brook and McMurray of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children on the
charge of cruelty to their 3-months-old baby.
They were occupying a flat at 834 Mission
street, which was in a filthy condition. Both
were drunk when arrested. A week ago Mrs.
Fleming was arrested on a similar charge, but
was released on her own recognizance by
Judge Conlan on her promise to reform.
Bannon'i Friends Indorse Candidates.
The following candidates were indorsed at
the grand testimonial benefit tendered re
cently to Malachi Banuon by his many friends
at Mission Turn Verein Hall: C.L.Taylor,

MEMORIALS TO CONGRESS.
Important Action at the Regular
Quarterly Meeting of the Cham
ber of Commerce.
The regular quarterly meeting of the
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco
was held yesterday, Hugh Craig presiding.
Two memorials to Congress were drafted.
The first was a plea for aid for American
Bhipbuiding. It was shown that England
uppropriates $5,000,000 and France $2,~
100,000 in subsidies for the carriage of
mail each year, while the contribution
from this Govarnment is almost nil, as
compared with these figures. Attention
was called to the fact that England re
cently established a mail service and line
of steamers between Vancouver, Hong
kong and Yokohama. Now there is a
proposition on foot to run a line be
tween Vancouver and the Fiji Islands,
touching at Honolulu. It is represented
in the memorial that American steamers
are not subsidized enough.
The second memorial was on behalf of
Senator ElKins' bill for the protection of
American shipping in loreign trade. It
asks for a return to the old system upon
which American trade was built up and
specifies that no appropriation is counted
upon.
A communication was sent to Secretary
Herbert of the navy asking for assistance
in establishing a signal station on the
summit of Mount Tamalpais. Professor
Davidson, who was present, explained
tuat the location was particularly adapted
for observations, as a view of the outside
ocean could be seen from there, while
people on the lower strata were in the
fog.
A communication was sent to the United
States naval authorities that the fog siren
at Point Wilson was not wording at the
time of the wrecking f the steamer Uma
tiiia. The cause, as understood by the
chamber, was that there was not enough
fre-h water to operate the machine.
An application was made for some stand
ard work on the magnetic needle.
Julian Somuag met the members and told
them of the quantities o/ convict goods
dumped into the State from lud;ana, Min
nesota, Pennsylvania, Illinois and New
York. He showe<i how it was a hardship
on the people and the laborers of this
State, especially as convict labor here can
only produce jute bags.
Mr. Sonnta. strenuously advocated the
advisability of looking into this one par
ticular line of harm which is being done
the people of this State.
TO ASSIST RICHMOND.
Candidates P edge Their Aid to
Improve That Section of
the City.
Point Lobos Imprcvem nt C ub Listens
but Do:s Not Indorse Any of
the Speakers.
The Point Lobos improvement Club
met last evening on Fiftn avenue, between
Clement street and Point Lobos avenue,
the avowed purpose beine to listen to all
candidates for political office who pre
sented themselves. President George R.
Fletcher, who presided, explained this.
"We are not here for the purpose of in
dorsing any candidate, but to give you
an opportunity to see, to hear and to
judge of those who are asking for your
votes."
William P. Johnson, the secretary of the
club, kept a list of all the speakers. The
list was long. All parties and factions
were represented. The speech of the even
ing was made by George VV. Elder, the
nominee for Superintendent of Streets on
the regular Republican ticket.
"You all know my record," said Mr.
Elder. "I have been the expert of the
Board of Supervisors two years. I have
seen to it that contractors should live
strictly up to the specifications. I have
twelve years' experience with the streets.
1 think that 1 can fill the position of
Superintendent of Streets as well as any
of my opponents. If elected I will con
duct the office on business principles and
on a business basis. If my record it good
I want your votes; if it is not good do not
vote for me."
Among the speakers were T. G. Parker,
A. H. Kayton, F. L. Turpin, F. F. New
berry, Frank P. Dunne, Frank Kerrigan,
Edward J. Gallagher, Edward Ai^-eltin
ger, E. L. Head, Dr. George I. Drucker,
Thomas W. Rivers and P. M. Deiauey, all
of whom are candidates for position on
some ticket. Speeches were also made by
P. Philopena, president of the Philopena
Club; Emery Prien, a member of the club,
and by others. Nearly all the speaker*
promised to do what they could for the
Richmond District.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 21, 1896.
THE GERMAN DEMOCRATS
Addressed by Governor Budd and
Congressman Maguire in
Metropolitan Hall.
Ths Meeting Was Also Spcken to in
the G iman Lm^uge by Dr. Max
M gnus and M Greenblatt.
There was a meeting of German-Ameri
can Democrats at Metropolitan Hall last
night.
Max Green biatt opened the meeting and
said that a speech in the German or any
other foreign language sounded better in
a Democratic meeting than in others, be
cause the Democratic party has been the
friend of Americans of foreign birth.
The speaker was interrupted by a voice
calling for Budd, but Greenblatt went on
and said that it was singular that Demo
crats should be called anarchists for daring
to have an independent financial policy of
their own.
Again the speaker was interrupted with
cries of "Give us James Budd." Still he
went on and defended the financial policy
of the Democratic party, and then eulo
gized the Democrats elected at the State
election two years aeo.
Governor Budd was then introduced as
chairman of the meeting and was received
with cheers. He reviewed the courses of
the campaign of 1894, and told how he had
appealed to tue Germans to vcte for him.
He then suggested that if men were or
dered to wear McKinley buttons they
could go into the polling-booths and there
go back on the declaration of the emblem
they wore.
The speaker then went orer the oft-re
pealed D rnocratic explanation of the
issue of bonds and the manner in which
they should be paid, and denounce I the
money plank of the Republican party.
He then made an attack on the railroad
tor taking cases brought agsibSt it
into the United States courts, and de
claied that Bryan as President would en
force the law requiring the State courts to
pass on actions brought against corpora
tions, and he would prevent bondholders
from dictating in what kind of coin their
bonds shall be paid.
Dr. Max Magnus was the next speaker,
but betore he got fairly started the audi
ence commenced to thin out.
After eulogizine Governor Altgeld in
the English language he delivered an ad
dress in German, during the course of
which he isaid that it is the duty of all
Germans who nave come to this country
to make it their home, lo defend it and to
hurl back the fiends that would crush
them to the wall. Then some one not im
pressed with a speech that he did not
understand called for Judge Maguire.
The speaker switched off into English,
and declared that if he could not obtain
gold he was willing to take silver.
Congressman James G. Maguire was
then introduced, and he, too, was cheered.
He declared that the Democratic party is
either right or wrong, and should be sup
ported or defeated, as it deserve-. The
National issue, be said, is the remonetiza
tion of silver, and anotherissue of interest
to California is the refunding of the rail
road debt.
The speaker declared t hat there is needed
a second Andrew Jackson to force the
monopolists to so, and that this second
Jackson will be William J. Bryan.

A. W. McPHERSON
AND HIS PISTOL
"Brick," the Well-Known
Politician, Goes Gun
ning.
He Took a Shot This Morning
at Edward Crawford of
Honolulu.
ONLY A BUSINESS AFFAIB.
Says He Asked for Money Due, Was
Insulted and Tried to Sap
Crawford's Face.
Everybody knows "Bricu" McPherson,
the politician, but everybody does not
know A. W. McPherson, the business
agent, although they are one and the
same person.
"Brick," or rather A. W., McPherson
had a rather Inharmonious meeting yes
terday morning with Edward Crawford,
another business agent, whose home is
among the sugarcanes of Honolulu. It
was early in the mornine, between 1 and 2
o'clock, and had it been a little later
Old Sol peeping over tha horizon
might have had his eye put out by
a ballet from the pistol of the angered
McPherson. As it is, no one has been
hurt physically, although there has been
a certain amount of bad blood engendered
and some of it may be spilled if the Me-
Phersons and the Crawfords come to
gether again.
"BricK"â it is easier to call him by that
sobriquet, because no one ever thinks of
addressing him as Alexander â tells the
story himself of his encounter with ail the
characteristic vigor he knows how to put
in bis speecb.
"You can go to Crawford," he stated
yesterday afternoon, while he was still in
the heat of the affair, "and tell him that
I'm not afraid of him or any other man
living. I will permit no man to insult me
as he did and not resent it; nor w. ll I
allow any man to withhold from me ille
gally what is my just due. Crawford may
swear out a warrant for my arrest, if he
wants to, and I will prove by his own
friends that he was in the wrong and was
the first to draw his gun. Anyho^v I will
bring him into court so as to establish my
claim against him in a civil suit.
"Some time ago I entered into a con
tract with Crawford whereby he was ena
bled to dispose of a piece of Hawaiian
property. I enlisted 'a number of my
friends to consummate the deal, and there
are many thousand dollars due me and
others, who pulled the sale through.
"â When I was on my way home early
this morning I met Crawford at McAllister
and Franklin streets. He was with a
couple of mends and I greeted him. I
asted him when he would be ready to
pay mv commission, as I wanted to in
form others who were interested in the
affair with me.
"Instead of giving me a square answer
he was inclined to be quarrelsome and
told me he wouldn't pay me a cent until
I gave him $475 I owed nim.
"I don'i deny 1 owe him that amount
on another transaction, but that is a paltry
sum compared to what is coming to me
from him. I told him he was foolish, and
that I was ready at any moment to settJe
accounts.
"It was then he became insulting and
called me a name I'll stand from no one.
I reached out and made a pass at him. It
wasn't a punch, but more of a slap, be
cause I wanted to recover quickly, in case
his friends might want to jump me.
Crawford backed away and went down
into his pocket for his pi3tol. I saw his
move, and I also drew niy gun. I wasn't
going to let him kill me, as I have got my
wife and little babies to look after, so I
was ready in a moment. Crawford's
friends piled in on us and prevented much
damage. In tbe row I got bruised a little,
my pistol went off accidentally and they
hustled Crawford away.
"I didn't try to kill him, but I was
ready to meet him at his own game. I'm
waiting now for nim to cause my arrest,
and the entire business will come out iv
court.
"I will bring it there anyhow, that I
may get what money is due me and tbe
people who brought about the deal."
STARS OF THE ORIENT.
Reports Show There Have Been
Large Gains During the
Year.
Recommendations of the Grand Matron.
Entertainment for tbe Decoto
Home.
The annual session of the Grand Chap
ter, Order of the Eastern Star, is being
held this year in Golden Gate Hall. The
first session was called at 1 o'clock yester
day afternoon.
There were present at the opening
representatives from ninety-four char
tered chapters and from fourteen chapters
under dispensation. There were fifteen
grand officers present and twenty-eight
past grands, besides a large number who,
while not representatives to the grand
body, were entitled to be present. There
were at one time more than 400 members
of tbe order in the hall.
The officers of the Grand Chapter are:
Worthy grand patron, James Be.-tor Merritt;
worthy grand matron, Mrs. Carrie Louisa
Peaslee; associate grand patron, Rosroe Ed
win Hewitt: associate grand matron, Mrs.
Florence MiMer; grand secretary, Mrs. Kate
Josephine Wiliats; grand treasurer, Mrs. Mary
T. Dean ; grand conductress, Mrs. Clara Abbott
Giberson; associate grand conductress, Mrs.
Clara Shields; grand chaplain, Mrs. Susan
Rucker; grand marshal, Mrs. Fannie Mc-
Cowen; grand Adah, Miss Maggie Weyer;
grand Ruth, Miss Carrie Thorns: grand Esther,
Miss Jennie B. Belt; grand Martha, Mrs. Kate
Haenny; grand Electa, Mrs. Belle Smith; grand
organist, Mrs. Lucy Daunals; grand warder,
Mrs. Ellen Neilsen; grand sentinel, Robert
Travers.
The worthy grand patron, James Bestor
Merritt, presented his report, from which
it appears that during iLe year he insti
tuted twelve new chapters and issued dis
pensations to organize five more, made
160 visits to 117 different chapters, and
during that time missed but one appoint
ment and canceled but one appointment,
from causes beyond his power to foresee.
He urged the necessity of more uniformity
of work and unity of purpose, and declared
that there is a lack of appreciation of the
importance of tbe order.
Tbe order has at this time a membership
of about 8700, and during the year there
was a net cain of more than 1100 despite
the fact that there was from various causes
a loss of nearly 800 members.
The report of the worthy grand matron,
Mrs. Carrie L. Peaslee, was also presented.
Durinz the term she visited thirty-five
chapters. Her report contains the reports
to hÂ«t of deputy grand matrons, and these
give a good idea of the condition
of the different chapters. She recom
mended the redistricting of the southern
portion of the State; the use of tbe Bible
in administering test oaths; that tbe
time for which grand representatives
shall Hold be named by the Grand Chap
ter; the devising of a more satisfactory
system of inspecting tne chapters of the
jurisdiction, and that those chapters un
der dispensation giving evidence of com
petence to do tbe work and a willingness
to obey the laws and regulations of tbe
order be granted charters. She reports
tbe order in a flourishing condition.
The report of Grand Secretary Mrs.
Kate J. Wiliats and tbat of the committee
on foreign correspondence, as well as tbat
of tbe grand treasurer, Mrs. Deane, were
read.
The worthy grand patron filled vacan
cies as follows: Credentials, S. J. Brew
ington; returns, Louise Sullivan; appeals
and grievances, Mary Sweenev; warrants
and dispensations, Julia L. Pybrun;
finance, J. Boiler.
During the afternoon D. Oaywalt.worthy
patron of Golden Gate No. 1, on behalf of
Mrs. Duren, presented the worthy grand
matron with a bunch of very fine chrysan
themums.
Last evening Ivy, B?ulab and Harmony
chapter* entertained the officers of the
Grand Chapter, after Ivy Chapter had ex
emplified the work.
To-night tbe iocal chapters will give an
entertainment in GoJden Gate Hall in aid
of tbe Masons' Home in Decoto for Wid
ows and Orphans.
To-morrow night the officers of the
Grand Chapter will exemplify the work in
King Solomon's Hall, Masonic Temple,
after which Golden Gate Chapter will en
tertain the officers of the Grand Chapter.
The headquarters of the order during
the session will be the Baldwin Hotel.
Arrangements have been made for the
entertainment of the delegates to the
Grand Chapter, and on Saturday, after the
close of the session, there will be an excur
sion to last until the following Monday.
The excursionists will go to Stanford Uni
versity and view that institution of learn
ing, after which they will go to Monterey
by tbe broad-gau^e. On Sunday they will
be taken over tbe seventeen-mile drive
and shown the sights of Monterey and
vicinity. On Monday they will return by
the narrow-gauge route, stopping at San
Jose and for lunch at the Feiton Big Trees.
The Grand Chapter will meet again this
morning.
BIG RAILROAD SUIT.
The Union Trust Company Seeks to
foreclose a Mortgage for Five
Million Dollars.
The case of the Seattle, Lake Shore and
Eastern Railway Company vs. the Union
Trust Company, on appeal, came np for
argument in tbe United States Court of
j Appeals yesterday. Benjamin S. Gross
j cup of Tacoma appeared lor the appellant,
while E. C. Hughes of Seattle represented
the trust company.
It appears that the trust company holds
I outstanding mortgage bonds of the rail
road company to the extent of $5,558,000,
and that the latter defaulted in the semi
annual interest due August, 1893. The
1 action was commenced by :he filing of a
I bill on December 23, 1893, setting forth the
j fact that the interest ($200,000) was over
due, and by conditions of the mortgage
the principal and interest aiso became due.
The case was heard in tee Circuit Court of
Washington, resulting in a victory for the
tr ust company. The case now comes to
the Court of Appeals on a motion for a
rehearing. The application, after able
argument on both sides, was submitted to
the court's consideration.
OUTWITTED BY KEEPERS
Duck-Hunters on a Fruitless
Cruise to San Pablo
Point.
The Birds Were Frightened Away
From the Ponds During the
Night Hours,
Five yachts manned by bold hunters
sailed merrily up the bay on Sunday last,
tbe hearts of the Nimrods beating high
with hope and their minds filled witn
visions of fat and succulent ducks by the
score.
Five yachtloads of luckless, duckless
and angry hunters came home yesterday
and swore fluently under their breaths at
preserve-owners and those about San
Pablo Point in particular.
The saucy Rover, commanded by Charley
Bruce, headed the fleet, and a more en
thusiastic band of hunters never dropped
a duck.
They knew that the marsh was alive
with ducks, and while they knew that the
sloughs were fenced they were out for
game and intended to get it at any cost.
The fleet, which consisted of tbe Rover,
Truant, Nixy, Fearless and Juanita.
reached San Pablo toward evening, and
by the time they were snugly moored as
near to the duck ponds as the fence would
permit, it was too durk to shoot, so It was
decided to wait until morning before
venturing out. Guns and ammunition
wire looked to, and the boys crawled into
their berths.
Their coming had been noted by the
ever-prowling keepers, however, and be
fore any one had found sleep the banging
of guns from the direction of the nearest
ponds warned the hunters that something
was on foot. They went on deck to see
what was bappenin -, and after watching
a few flashes of powder shoot toward tbe
sky sent a scout to find out the reason of
it all.
He speedily learned for a voice shouted :
"Guess they are all scared off, BilL
Let's drive them up the marsh."
It then developed tbat tbe keepers were
driving the ducks as far away from the
yachts as the reports of their heavily
loaded guns couM scare them, and the
fusillade was kept up all night going
further and further away.
At daylight the keepers came back to
the vicinity of the yachts and drove the
few ducks that had returned into flight.
After a fruitless effort to get enoueh birds
to furnish a game dinner the disappointed
hunters returned to this City.
The Hicks Murder.
The attorneys for the defense in the case of
Attorney Joseph A. Mitchell, charged with the
murder of Private Detective E. T. Hicks, met
with a disappointment yesterday. Detective
Harry Reynolds searched Hicks' safe-deposit
box with the Pacific Coast Savings Company
in the Flood building for the brass knuckles
and revolver a'.leeed to have been used by
Hicks while assaulting Mitchell on the morn
ing of the murder, but the only article* In the
box were two envelopes.
Abbie M. Gregory, sister of Edward T. Hicks,
the detective who on October 15 was shot and
killed by J. A. Mitchell, yesterday applied for
special letters of administration on the estate
of the deceased.
It is alleged In the application that Hicks
was a single mar, which is in direct contra
diction to the claims of a woman who has
appeared since the tragedy and claimed the
remains. The value of the detective's estate
is placed at $1500.

HIS RED BLOOD
STAINS THE STONE
Eddie Galvery Crushed to
Death by a Mission-
Street Car.
A Fender Would Have Saved
the Tears His Little
Sisters Wept
MOTOBMAN LEADY AKRESTED
The Catastrophe Flippantly Regarded
at the Car Barns of tiie
Company.
Last night there was another victim of
Mr. Vining's merciless Mission-street trol
ley cars. Another young body was literally
crushed out of all semblance to human
shape and the young blood bathed the
white paving-stones with such a crimson
dye that earth was necessary to bide it
from sight.
About 6:30 last evening Mrs. Walter
Eddie Galvery, the Little Boy Who
Was Killed Last Night by a
Mission-Street Electric Car.
Green, residing at 1359^ Minna street,
sent her 12-year-old son, Eddie Galvery,
out to a drugstore for a bottle of magnesia.
Accompanied by Johnnie Murphy and
George Harcourt, boys in the neighbor
hood, he ran through a narrow passace
way, known as Keefe's alley, which leads
from Minna street to Mission, between
Fourteenth and Fifteenth. Accounts dif
fer as to the manner in which he was run
over*
Matthew Murphy, an old man who lives
at ISO 7 Mission street, was one of the few
witnesses of the accident. He said that
he saw the boy running across the street,
with other boys after him, and that the
next second, after looking up from light
ing his pipe, he heard a scream and saw
tne boy falling under the car.
Litile Johnny Murphy, about 7 years
old, says Eddie Galvery was jumping from
an outbound car to a Twenty-second and
Mission-street car when he was struck by
tbe latter and crushed to death under the
wheels. Johnny was standing on the curb
stone and says he saw the whole catas
trophe.
The car was No. 1031, Motorman Leady
and Conductor McMahon. The motorman
stopped the car as quickly as possible, but
the boy was already under the forward
trucks erindiDg to pieces. He was going
at a high rate of speed. The car was about
150 feet from the crossing of Fourteenth
street and bound down Mission street.
The car was removed from the remains
and the Morgue notified. Deiective Gia
ham and Patrolman E. J. Thomson of the
Seventeenth-street police station arrested
Motorman Leady.
Streetcars were lined up for two or
three blocks behind the body until the
Morgue wagon arrived and took the re
mains away. The body was horribly
mutilated. It was collected in fragments.
The cashier said that Mr. Abrams, who
bosses the putting away of the cars, was
LEON E. JONES.
Leon E. Jones, the Republican candidate for the Aesembly from the Thirty
nintb Di&trict, is a citizen who is well fitted to serve the State in the capacity to which
he aspires. He was born in Platte Ctty in 1841 and arrived in California in 1850. In
1856 be went to Pennsylvania and graduated from Meadville Academy. Soon after
the opening of the war, in 1862. he entered the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry as pri
vate and served with distinction. He was at South Mountain, Antietara, and was
wounded in the battle of Kernstown. In March, 1864, he was promoted to be second
lieutenant; in December, 1864, to be first lieutenant, and in 1865 brevetted captain.
In March of the same year he was mustered out. He returned tn California in 1869,
and has resided in San Francisco since 1879, havins served the City as Chief Deputy
under Coroner Hugnes and in other capacities. He is a member of Thomas Post, G.
A. X., and the Loyal Legion.
the man to see, and another man, a
motorman, jocosely remarked that Boss
Abrams was out on a week's vacation.
The cashier repeated that Boss Abrams,
who could tell where Leady might be
found, was in the barn that minute, and a
time-keeper had to come out from the in
side and insist in confusing the where
abouts of Boss Abrams and Motorman
Leady.
Eddie Galvery's mother is married to a
mail-carrier named Walter Green, who
does not live with his wife. He has two
little sisters who last night, along with
their mother, wept themselves into late
slumber over little Eddie's sudden death.
His life would have beeu saved by a
fender.
B. M. Leady, the motorman, was
taken to tbe City Prison, where
he was booked for manslaughter, and was
released on his own recognizance by Judge
Low.
Leady said that the first thing he knew
about the accident was when the boy
bumped against the car, and before he
could stop the front wheel hail passed
over him and be was found under the rear
wheei. Â«
"I could not have saved him," said
Leady, "as he jumped off the rear of the
west-bound car just in front of mine.
The car on which he was riding was filled
with passengers. 1 was not going at a fast
rate of speed, as there are cross rails not
far from where tbe accident occurred and
we always slowdown there. lam exceed
ingly sorry it happened, but I could not
help it"
OBNOXIOUS CHINESE
Washbousea Operating Later Than 10
P. 31. to the Discomfort of
Many.
The Chinese laundry nuisance is again
in process of agitation. This time, how
ever, not only those living contiguous to
the washhouses are beginning to make
complaint, but even the Mongolians them
selves.
Tbe law provides that these washhouses
shall close promptly at 10 p. m., a3 theJChi
nese method of cleansing garments in
volves a great deal of noise, due to
pounding and thrashing tbe garments
around in tubs and on boards. Conse
quently those iiving in the circumjacent
region are prevented from goins? to sleep.
Lately it seems that many of the Chi
nese operating these establishment have
been in tbe habit of working their men
till 1 or 2 A. m , and some enterprising
Celestials have both a day and an all
ni>;nt force of workmen. As a result,
many citizens living in that part of the
City where most of these wasbhouses and
laundries are located, mainly north of
Powell street, along Clay, Sacramento,
Washington and Jackson, have suffered
great annoyance.
Even the workmen in many instances
are complaining at the lengthened hours.
A concrted movement is on foot to inter
est the Chinese labor unions in the mat
ter in order to obtain relief. Unless the
law is more actively enforced, the labor
unions may abate tbe nuisance them
selves.
MRS. FREITAS DIVORCED.
Wife of the Commission Mer
chant Secures a Decree
for Cruelty.
She Is Awarded a Large Amount of
Property and $50 per Month
Alimony.
A celebrated divorce case, that has been
in the courts for a long time, was yester
day decided by Judge Slack. About two
years ago Ada M. Freitas, wife of Manuel
T. Freitas, a well-known commission mer
chant, sued for a dissolution of tbe matri
monial contract existing between them,
alleging that her husband had treated her
with extreme cruelty in that he bad used
harsh language toward her and had on
one occasion beaten her with bis fists*.
Mr. Freitas fougnt the case bitterly, and
filed a cross-complaint charging that his
sDOUse had been guilty of unseemly con
duct in connection with a man named
Smith.
Judge Slack recently referred the matter
to Court Commissioner Lawler, who re
ported that he found from the evidence
that the charge of cruelty is true, hut that
the allegations made in tbecross-complaint
are not sustained by tbe evidence. He
recommended that a divorce be granted
the plaintiff, which was accordingly done.
By the terms of an agreement yesterday
entered into between the parties the
Freitas home, at 1931 San Carlos avenue,
is turned over to the wife. Tiie entire
furnishings of the establishment are also
assigned to her, as is a piece of real estate
fronting on Elliott Park, west of Steiner
street. Sixteen hundred dollars on deposit
in the Grangers' .bank and $60 per month
alimony complete the allowance made for
tbe plaintiff.
Attorneys Delmas and Shortridge
brought the case to a successful termina
tion for Mrs. Freitas.
FOUR TICKETS
IN THE SCHOOLS
Schoolma'ams Taking a
Hand in the Directors'
Fight.
They Form Clubs and Select
Their Favorites Among the
Candidates.
A TEN DOLLAR ASSESSMENT.
Eiisha Brooks Denounces the Combi
nation in the Name of the
Department.
The School Department is agitated over
politics, that is not as a department, but
as individuals. This year, more than ever
before, the teachers are interested in the
outcome of the election for School Direc
tors. There are many reasons why this
should be the case. They want to have as
many friends as possible on the board, be
cause the department is not under civil
service rules and the Damocles sword of
official displeasure swings above their
heads suspended by a fine hair.
There are very lew men among the 900
teachers in the department, and this fact
enders the situation of the teachers all
the more precarious. Votes count in
politics, and the ladies, not being allowed
to wield the ballot, must do considerable
campaigning among their friends.
There are already nearly half a dozen
ticKets in the field, but the School Depart
ment as such is not responsible for them.
Ladies of similar tastes and preferences
get together and make up a list of the
twelve candidates whom they would pre
fer as members of the new Board of Edu
cation.
Then the candidates are requested to
put up $10 each to raise a fund of $120 to
defray the expense of printing 75,000 cards.
These cards are carefully distributed
among the friends of the teachers with a
circular, requesting their male friends to
vote for them.
There are already four tickets in the
school field so far as heard from, and con
siderable feeling as well as rivalry has
been created. One of the two leading
tickets is said to have been made up by
Miss Fowler of the Teachers' Aid Society,
with the assistance of a coterie of mem
bers, and tbe other by Miss McFadden and
Mrs, Powers.
The Fowler ticket is as follows:
Armer, D. ; Blake, P. P., A. C. D.; Carew, A.
C. D., P. P., N. P. ; Conrad, D. ; Hammond, R. ;
Barrington.D., N. P.; Powers, R., U. L. ; Waller,
D, P. P., N. P., U. L ; Halsted, R., N. P., C. 1.,
U. L.; Soper, R., N. P., U. L.; Head, R.; McEl
roy, C. R., C. 1., N. P.
Tbe following is the McFadden- Powers
ticket:
Powers, R., U. L. : Hammond, R. ; Manner.
R.; Barrjngton, D., C. 1., N. P.; Waller, D., P.,
C. i., N. P., U. L.: Hartwick, D.; Gallagher, D.,
N. P.; Heaa, R. ; Armer, D. ; Byrne, D. ; Der
ham, D. ; Kemp, R.
Here is another ticket of unknown
motherhood:
T. R. Carew, D. ; Dr. Drucker, R.; C. L. Bar
rington, D. ; Phil Hammond. R.; Byrne, D. ;
Powers, R. ; William Derham, D.; Buruett, R. ;
John C. McCarthy, D. ; Frank Bragg, D.; Hart
wick, D. ; Bantel, D.
And here is another foundling:
Hammond, R. ; Powers, R. ; Carew, D. ; Bar
riiiÃton.D.: Bantel, D.; Head, R.; Soper, R. ;
McCarthy, Dem.-Pop.; Armer, R. ; Bragg, D. ;
Kemp or Conrad; Waller, Dem.-Pop. and P.
Candidates who had not been put on all
the tickets complained loudly. Some of
them who bad paid their $10 assessment
fairly shrieked, and that is why Principal
Brooks called the matter to the attention
of the teachers at tbe meeting in the Girls'
High School yesterday afternoon.
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.
Principal Brooks Denounced the
Scheme as Unauthorized.
There was a good response yesterday
afternoon to the call for an anti-charter
meeting of public-school teachers in the
Girls' High School, on Scott street, but
95 per cent were not voters, because they
belonged to tbe lovable sex. This gave a
Mormon aspect to the assemblage, but
there the similarity ended, for the women
seemed to know more about tbe subject
and to be much more enthusiastic than
the lordly men.
Madison Babcock presided, ana as soon
as he had called the meeting to order
EHsha Brooks, principal of the school,
took the platform and in an excited man
ner said that he had been informed by
four candidates for offices at the coming
election that they had been assessed and
had paid $10 each to be placed upon a
ticket to be supported by the School De
partment.
Mr. Brooks' remarks were to the effect
that He had heard from good authority,
and he did not doubt its truth, that cer
tain persons in or out of the School De
partment had been getting up a ticket,
and that some candidates ior school di
rectorships had been assessed and had
paid $10 eacb.
He added that the School Department
had not authorized any person or persons
to make up such a ticket, and he de
nounced the whole proceeding in the
name of t: c department.
Mr. Brooks thereupon offered a resolu
tion to the effect that the teachers disap
proved of any arrangement looking toward
the carrying out of such a scheme.
Albert Lyser was quickly on his feet to
deny that he nad had anything to do with
the matter, and to join in the denuncia*
tion.
Mr. JJabcock introduced ex-Senator
Patrick Reddy, who, he said, would ex
plain tbe objectionable features of the
proposed new City char er.
Mr. Reddy began by calling attention
to the fact that the chapter vested too
much powei in the nands of one man. No
man was good enough to be intrusted witu
absolute power. No sensible, conservative
citizen could indorse the placing of so
much power in the hands of the Mayor.
The interests of persons who had devoted
their lives to education were that they
s ould not be disturbed in their positions
without cause, and that cause must be
substantial.
Section 3 of chapter 3, authorizing the
discbarge of teacners "for sufficient cause,
which shall be determined by tue board,"
was commented upon as a dangerous
clause. It left the cause wholly in the
discretion of the board, and hence the
reason for a teacher's dismissal might re
main locked up in the bosom of the board
even alter the discharge of the unfortu
nate victim.
There was a matter, (continued Mr.
Reddy, which was not embraced in the
synopsis of the charter prepared by its
friends, for what reason he did not know.
That was the following provision: "Bverv
office except those waich are by this
charter made elective shall become vacant
immediately on the taking effect of thi9
charter." In other words, the places of
all the teachers in the department will at
once be made vacant should the charter
become a law.

Reddy at this stage by asking whether the
charter did not assume to pui out of office
the Board of Education to be elected by
thu people on November 3 and to take
office on January 1,. 1897.
Mr. Reddy replied that the charter un
dertook to do tbat impossible thing, was
in conflict with the existing laws and
was therefore null and void. He pro
ceeded to show that the instrument was
unconstitutional and therefore inopera-
tive.
If that law is good for anything, out goes
the Board of Education and out go tbe
teachers. If this charter should be
adopted it will go before the Legislature,
and if those obnoxious clauses are rati
fied by the Legislature they become the
law, and if they are not ratified they do
not become tbe law. If ratified wbat be
comes of the law retaining teachers in
their positions? he asked. He answered
his own question by explaining tbat the
new charier, if adopted by tbe Legisla
ture, would repeal the present law.
Joseph O'Connor called attention to a
proposed amendment to tbe constitution
providing that charters shall be subject to
the general laws, "except in relation to
the municipalities for which they are
drawn."
Mr. Reddy pointed out that tbe mem
bers of tbe Fire Department were to be re
tained and the school-teachers were to be
put out
"That's because we have no vote," piped
a pretty school ma'am in the front row.
After the laughter raised by this bon
moi had subsided Mr. Reddy proceeded to
show how the charter regulated the
method of getting back iuto tbe schools.
The mode provided is that all persons
who desire to be appointed as teachers
shall undergo a competitive examination,
and shall hold teachers' certificates, "and
who have been educated in the public
school system of this State." He spoke of
the considerable number of teachers who
had won their laurels before the adoption
of the present system, and who would be
barred out by this provision. He com
mented at some length on the absurdity
of the Citizens' Charter Association ask- j
ing a class of intelligent people, such as !
are the teachers, to vote for a charter
which legislates them out of public em
ployment.
The speaker challenged any lawyer of
standing to say that this State could not
prescribe the qualifications of those per
sons eligible to teach in its schools. Hence
the charter if adopted by the Legislature
would be valid and binding. He made a
reference to tbe fact that this provision of
the charter had been suggested by "people
of a prossriptive state of mind, who would
wall this State in like old China, and if
they should succeed doubtless the same
results will follow in due time."
The principle of centralization of power
enunciated in the charter was in conflict
with civil service reform, he said. The
contention to the contrary was sophistical.
Even the President of the United States
could not appoint a man to Â» prominent
official position without the advice of the
Senate, nor could the Governor of Califor
nia appoint any responsible official with,
out the approval of the Senate.
Henry N. Clement asked leave to re
ply, but Mr. Baocock cut him short with
the promise that he would have an oppor
tunity later.
"Give him a show," cried several teach
ers.
"I challenge Mr. Reddy to a debate on
thai question," snouted Mr. Clement.
"An I I accept the challenge," responded
Mr Reddy quickly.
Then the meeting adjourned, and the
pretty schoolma'ams flocked around the
ex-Senator and congratulated him, for Mr.
Reddy is a manly looking man and he was
fighting for their cause.
DAMAGED BOOTHS.
Exciting Runaway in Which Two Poll
ing Places Suffered.
Two election booths on O'Farrell street
were badly damaged and several persons
narrowly escaped injury by a team be
longing to D. de Bernardi, 406 Front street,
running away yesterday afternoon. The
team was hitched by Driver R. H. Patter-
L son in front of his home, 528 ,o'Farroll
street. They took fright and, breaking
tbe hitching-strap, dashed down the
street.
They collided with an election booth
about 100 feet from the Patterson resi
dence and almost demolished it. The
Bbock of the collision turned the horses,
and they crossed the street, and after tip
pine a buggy over dashed into another
election booth near Jones street. Both of
the horses fell on the last contact, and
were grasped by several men and secured.
The horses and wagon escaped with a
slight damage, but the voting booths will
have to undergo repairs before they can
be used on November 3.
