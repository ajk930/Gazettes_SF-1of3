VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 63.
OAKLAND IS
ALL READY
Her Exposition Begins To-
Morrow With Very
Fine Exhibits.
OPENING EXERCISES IN
THE EVENING.
Only the Varied Products of
Alameda County Are On
Exhibition.
PROGRAMME CHANGES ON EACH
NIGHT.
Manufactures Shown as Well as
Horticultural and Agricultural
Products.
The second annual Oakland Exposition,
which may be more accurately called the
Alameda County Fair, because it com
prises the products of Alameda County
only, will open to-morrow morning at 10
o'clock.
But tbe opening exercises will not take
place till 8 o'clock in tbe evening, when
there will be" speeches, and the hand will
play, and the first big crowd will be
present, and there will be brilliant illum
inations.
The exposition will continue about two
weeks. It covers 60,000 square feet pf
room, and is bounded by Harrison, Web
ster, Eleventh and Twelfth streets. There
are flags and colors galore in all the de
partments and overhead. Yesterday" it 0
presented a brilliant appearance, even
though all the exhibits were not in place,
and it lacked those finishing touches
which brine order out of chaos and put
the blush of beauty on.
As an exhibit of the horticultural,
agricultural and manufacturing resour
ces of Alameda County, it is not ' only
superbly creditable, but it is doubt
ful that any other county in the
world can equal itv In the array of
exhibits there appears to be almost the
variety that one saw at the great Mid
winter Fair. At first sight the only differ-
: 'ence appears to "be in the quantity. But
for a single county there is a vast amount
of quantity, and it is weH worth going to
see. If the large crowds which the expo
sition deserves are as jolly as the fair is
splendid during the next two weeks, the
people of Oakland and of Aiameda County
will truly have a good time in showing to
the world how nature has gifted their land
and how great is the result of their in
dnstry. .
The programme for to-morrow evening
is as follows :

THE FAIR IN GENERAL.
Exclusively a County Exhibit-Why
It Is Given and What May
Be Seen.
"The exposition of this year," said Su
perintendent Sharp, "will be about twice as
large as last year's and more than three
time*' as good. â¢
"It is an Alameda County Fair, and we
have called it the Oakland exposition.
This is the second of the kind Alameda
County has had, and last year's exposition
was the first of its kind ever held in the
United States.
"The exposition," he continued, "will
be on tbe same lines of that of last year.
The exhibits comprise the manufactures,
horticultural and agricultural products of
Alameda County only. In this regard the
fair differs from any other, as in the ordi
nary fair articles are shown from all sec
tions of the State.
"The great object of the fair," he said,
"is to educate the people of Aiameda

County up to the fact that they can be
self-supporting. It will show them what
actnally can be and is raised with "the
greatest profit and success in their own
county.
"Although the procTucts and manufac
tures are. taken exclusively from within
the county line, still they are greatly
varied, so -much so, in fact, that almost
every article used by man will have a
place," he concluded. ' â¢ m
Araone the most prominent of the ex
hibits will be the silk manufacturing dej
partment. Alameda claims one of the
largest if not the largest silk manufac
tory in the United States. A loom has
been erected, and is in charge of an experi
enced weaver. All kinds of silk fabrics
will be woven, so tnat the visitors to the
fair may see how silk is made.
Thq manufacture of iron is given a
prominent place, and promises to prove
vejry attractive and interesting. The gate
way to this exhibit of interesting machin
ery is arched by a model of a swinging
drawbridge. * <
The cotton-mills have also a large, ex
hibit and will manufacture rope, cloth and
other articles in which cotton is used.
The electro-plating exhibit is 'also very
complete and finely got up.
A special feature of the fair will be tne
evening entertainment to be given in the
large auditorium of the exposition.
Here will be given a series of fine per
formances, both musical, dramatic and
vaudeville in character. This is expected
to prove a great drawing card. H. O.
Trowbridge is the chairman of the com
mittee on amusements. He is ably assisted
by his wife, who last year filled tbe posi
tion of chairman of this same committee.
There is a pretty little story toid about
Mrs. Trowbridge in connection with her
work at last year's exposition. She was
besieged by newspaper men on her taking
charge of the amusement feature, who de
sired to secure ber picture for publication.
She refused to give a photograph because
she wished to have her picture seen only
in her own home. She also asked tnat no
sketch of her would be made. Pictures
appealed day after day, from the president
down to the janitors of the fair, but hers
was never presented to the public. She
makes tbe same request this year.
The fact that Aiameda County is a
county of manufactures as well as of agri
cultural products wi.l be promptly dem
onstrated. "We possess the land and ad
vantages here for manufacturing," said
the superintendent, "and we have already
done much in this line. While we can
show a horticultural exhibit, which I do
not believe can be excelled by any county
of the State and an agricultural exhibit
equally as fine, we can and do at the same
time present a display of manufactures
which would honor any county in the
Urnied States."
There are a number of manufacturing
exhibits yet to be placed, but even at this

Agricultural and Horticultural Ex
hibit Is* One of the- Finest
â¢ In the Exposition!
The horticultural exhibit is, ot .course,
one of the largest and most flattering de
partments of the exposition. Compared
with the entire space occupied by the ex
position it has its share of the room. Yes
terday many booths were being .con
structed, and those eatly birds among the
growers who had been on the ground
early were "ornamenting their booths in
the manner â¢ peculiar to 'these exhibits.
home canned fruit and .fruit in jars was
already in place, -but moss and great va
riety of fresh fruit will 'not' be plucked and
put in position till the last' moment. It
will be renewed from time- to time, so as
to continually give the fruit department a'
'fresh appearance.
* This department wfll show all the agri
cultural and horticultural products of the
county, including' grasses-, vegetables and
cereals, in addition to the fruit.
A SYLVAN SCENE.
A Pretty Park Where a Fountain
Plays and Costly .Plants
Are Arraye'd 1 .
One of the prettiest section's, of the fair
is the park. # It is q perfect floral and trop
ically sylvan retreat. The park is nearly
square in form, and from'it leads a broad
path almost around the exposition build- ,
ings to the fruit exhibit on another side.
In the center of the park -is a fine 'large
fountain. The base is composed of jagged
rocks of various sizes, and yesterday the
carp which first ventured out into -the
open water and tbe sunenine darted back
into the friendly shade beneatn them. To
day or Monday J. W. Stanford of Warm
Springs will send down twenty-five very
large goid fish to swim in the basin of the
fountain.
It is claimed the gold fish are the largest
in the State. At night the spray of the
fountain and the water in the basin will be
illuminated by electric lights of many
colors. One of the most attractive features
of this beautiful centerpiece of active and
placid water, rocks and colored lights is a
golden ball which is kept up in the air
above the fountain supply by the even
force, of the spouting column of -water
under it. It will appear as a golden ball
in midair.
Around tbe open space in the center of
the park are tropical plants of nearly every
known species. Walks run alongside and
between some of them, and the park is
also ornamented by beautiful urns and
some statuary standing amid the foliage.
Among tbe trees and plants. are palms,
banana, rubber tree, Australian fern, two

NEW YORK, N.Y., Aug. I.â The meeting
between Chairman" Hanna of the Repub
lican National Committee and Thomas C.
Platt, which has been expected for several
days, took place this afternoon. Appar
ently tbe conference was prearranged, al
though announcement was made at the
National headquarters this morning that
no formal invitation had been sept to Mr.
Flatt and his friends.
Mr. Hanna wa3 at his denk at head
quarters nearly all day/ He went to the
Waldorf for luncheon at 2 p. m. and re
turned hurriedly at 2:50. At 2:55 Mr.
PJatt arrived. He was accompanied by
Charles W. Hackett. chairman of the
State Committee, and Edward Lauter
bach, chairman of the County Committee.
The three gentlemen were met by Colonel
Swords, the Sergeant-at-arms, and es
corted at once to Mr. Hanna's rooms.
The Vice-Presidential candidate, Garrett
A. Hobart, and National Committeeman
Scott were at tbe conference, which lasted
an hour and a half.
"When the meeting was over Messrs.
Platt, Hackett and Lauterbach said as
they made" thair way to the express eleva
tor, that the talk had been most pleasant
and absolute harmony prevailed. Mr.
Platt said that active campaign work will
begin in tnis State at an early day, a"nd by
his smiles it was plain that the regular
organization will have charge. After the
callers had departed Me. Hanna saw the
newspaper men and in response to ques
tions said:
' "There has been a meeting of tne repre
sentatives of the State and county com
."mittees and myself. We have looked over
the situation and agreed upon a policy for
the.line of campaign in this State, which
will be in.charge of the State and coun.ty
organizations supplemented by the
National Committee. The wdrk will be
started at once. There is no definite time
set to open the campaign, but it is practi
cally.ready to begin now."
Mr! Hanna was aske"d if ex-President
Harrison had agreed to speak at the first
meeting in this ; city. He replied: "Mr.
Harrison has been invited by the local
organization, but has deferred his answer.
We hope he will speak."
Mr. Hanna saw a great many callers to
day. National Committeeman C. L. Kurtz
of Ohio, was among the number. Mr.
Kurtz said that the campaign in McKin
ley 's State will be opened August 15. Eosr
well G. Horr, who has been booked to
talk sound money in Nebraska, was an
other caller. He said be would speak at
Lincoln August 5 and will deliver five
speeches in Bryan's State.
Mr. Hanna left town this afternoon to
spend Sunday with his sister, Mrs. H.
Walton Jones >of Englewood, N.J.
SUCCESS IS ASSUMED.
But the Rrwublican Manager* Will
Watch the Bolter*.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 1. â General
â Powell Clayton of Arkansas,; who |is a
member of the National Republican Ex
ecutive Committee' attached to the head
quarters, called at National headquarters
to-day with United States Senator Shoup
of Idaho.
General Clayton went to New York to
enter the campaign arena as a fighter to
Ihe last day, and the Idaho Senator who
refused to bolt will remain here until
Monday, when he returns home to renew
his fight lor McKinley and the organiza
tion of the Republican party in his State.
Ex-Governor Thomas A. Osborne of To
peA, Kans., was also a visitor at head
quarters on his way to New York.
General Clayton reported a growing
gold sentiment among the Arkansas Dem
ocrats, and said he expected to see three
or four Congressional districts in his State
go Republican as a result of the Dem
ocratic revolt against free silver.
Senator Shoup had an Interesting story
to tell a United Press reporter about tbe
situation in Idaho resulting from the bolt.
He said :
"The bolters, led by Senator Dubois and
abetted by Matt T. Pattrie, chairman of
the State Committee, and the secretary,
are making desperate and questionable
efforts" to break* up* the Republican party
in Idaho; and they have boasted in circu
lar letters sent to every part of the State
that tney will .control the State Conven
tion. A majority of the State Committee
â eleven of the twenty-one members â pe
titioned Chairman Pattrie to convene the
committee August 3 to fix the qualifica
tion of Presidential electors, to fill two
vacancies on the committee and to fix the
qualification of voters at the primaries.
j The chairman complied" with the-petition,
but chanced the date to Aucust 8, which
i 3 the day fixed for holding the primaries
throughout the â¢' State. I propose that
straight 'Republican" conventions, county
and State, shall be.held.
"â¢The bolters propose to allow Demo
crats and Populists to vote at the prima
ries and to choose no-Presidential electors,
so that McKinley cannot get Idaho's vote.
Chairman Pattrie has assumed to call the
State Convention August 26 and, the
county conventions Augus.t 18. I am
going to see that tbfe bolters and their
crowd do not control the State Conven
tion. I. have opened headquarters in
Boise City, distributed plenty of literature
anÂ°d letters among the Republicans of the
State and my work is bearing fruit.
' "Before issuing my address I organized
McKinley clubs in every city and the one
in Boise City has 400 members. lam con
fident that tne people of my State, if given
a fair chance, will give a majority for the
McKinley electors.
"I believe the whola Scandinavian "vote
will go with us. The bolters are planning
to e4ecta new Legislature which will send
Dubois to the Senate for another term
next January. There are sound-money
Democrats la Idaho, too, who intend to
vote for McKinley."
Governor Osbor ne said the situation in
Kansas looked better every day for the
Republicans. Tnere was a strong drift
toward McKinley and he wae satisfied the
party would not lose any Republican votes
on account of the silver issue, but would
gain from the Democrats who repudiated
the Chicago platform. Many of them, he
said, were coming out openly and tbe old
Republicans who have been voting the
Populist ticket had been breaking away
from the ranks and returning to their first
j allegiance.

Guest
SAfiINAS, Cal., Aug. Lâ Claus Spreck^
els, b'ajled as the sugar king of the world*
and the special benefactor of Monterey
County, was given a reception here by such
a number of people as filled the Pavilion
this afternoon, and this evening was ten*
dered a banquet by the business men of
Salinas at the Abbot House.
The whole affair came almost in the na
ture of a surprise to Mr. Spreckels. He
came' down on the afternoon train with
the single purpose of having a conference
with the farmers of Salinas Valley with
regard to the possibilities of the country
in the matter of the production ci the
sugar beet The contemplated sugar re
finery to be located near here will be the
greatest thing of the kind in the world. Ie
will consume 450 tonÂ« of beets every day
that the wheels turn. It is very important
to Ifr. Spreckels, therefore, to know jnst
where the beets are coming from; if the
farmers will turn to it at once, begin their
cultivation and so have them ready when^
wanted. From 0 the demonstration in the
city to-day all doubt on that score must
have been dispelled.
Mr. Spreckels was met at the train by a
committee of citizens, escorted to the Ab
bott House, and, after some refreshments
there, to the Pavilion, led by the Salinas
brass band. The big hall was found to be
already crowded with people, floor and
gallery alike, a large proportion of those
present being ladies, who took a deep
interest in the proceedings. Mr. Spreckeis'
entrance to the hall was the signal for a
burst of applause that continued several
minutes. He was escorted to the platform
by Mayor Harris, and then by a nod and
smile and comprehensive sweep of the
hand signified his pleasure at the greeting
and at the unique decorations of the ball.
Back of the stage was written, in im
mense sugar beets wearing their long
leaves and stalks, the words "Our Future
Industry." The stage itself was literally
framed in sugar beets, and the entire hall
otherwise decorated with them. It was,
indeed, a big bower of sugar beets, the
white and green of which were relieved
with bright bunting.
The band stationed in the gallery played
cheerful &vs, while the vice-presidents,
nearly all of them farmers, took their .
places on the stage at the announcement
of the M^yor. TÂ°hey were : Henry Bar
din, James Bardin, J. D. Carr, William

Fellow-citizens: Tbe honor has been con
ferred upon me to preside at this meetintr. Its
objects, I think, are thoroughly understood,
and, I feel assured, are deeply appreciated by
every one present. That it is fraught with
meaning and deep significance to the future
weal and prosperity of this whole valley is an
admitted fact.
We have with us on this occasion a gentle
man who figures as first in the commercial
and industrial circles of this great State and
whose mammotn enterpiises in this and in
other parts of the Union are known through
out both hemispheres. His profound sagacity,
qUint intellect and untiring energy is a potent
lorce that is/elt among his iTellow-men when
ever exerted. He knows no failure. His
place in railroad enterprises as well as in com
mercial is second only to his own well
merited distinction of being the great sugar
king of the present day.
He has arisen from a poor farmer-boy to
occupy, by force of his own dauntless spirit, a
place in "the industrial forces of the world
that Is unsurpassed Yet, with all this, he is a
plain American citizen whose sympathies go
out for the laborer and mechanic. *ln the
great strikes of recent years we read of none
thsthave occurred where his capital operates
or his management prevails. .
1 have never heard of him being a great
speechmaker, as we popularly understand
that term; yet he makes great speeches.
When he will tell you that the largest beet
sugar factory and refinery in the world,
equipped with all the latest and most im
proved machinery and the latest patents, will
be located here, qualified only with the pro
vision that our farmers grow the beets, it will
enthuse' farmers and business men and all
classes more than the most brilliant oration
ever listened to.
Its accomplishment means to us all renewed
life and vigor. It means the stirring up and
stimulation of every branch of business and
industry. Ir-means the dawn of a new era In
this our own beautiful and fertile valley,
where the sugar beet grows to its greatest
perfection aud that the hand of God hÂ«s iv
this, as in other things, so richly and abun
dantly blessed. I have the pleasure of intro
ducin'c to you Hon. Claus Bpreekels, Califor
nia's greatest friend.
As^Jlr. Spreckels arose, he was greeted
with a thunder of applause that prevented
his being beard for some time.
"Ladies ana gentleman,' he said, when
the tumult subsided, *'I am very glad to
see bo many of you taking such a lively in
terest in the matter that brings us together
to-day. It is a matter which, I am sure
you will acree with me is vital to tbe welfare
of the farmers of our great State, particu
larly the iarnters of this valley. There are
two things essential to the manufacture of
beet suuar: one is* the beets, the other the
factory. Now, if you farmers will guaran
tee to grow the beets, I'll guarantee to turn
'em in 10 sugar. I propose to build here at
your door the greatest sugar factory and
refinery in the world â the greatest that
will be in the world. Nuw mark what I
say."
The speaker was here interrupted by an
other"prolonpea burst of applause.
"The-. factory will cover a wide area of
land. It will eat up 3000 tons of beets
every day and turn out every day 450 tons
of refined sugar ready for market. That
means the distribution among the farmers
of $12,000 every day, and |5000 more paid
to workmen and for other materials in the
manufacturing. You can see, therefore,
that thia is an important matter. I see
that you already understand that it is, and
I am pltased that you take this interest
with mt in the enterprise. Now, as I say,
it is for you to grow the beets. I'll do the
rest. I went to Europe for the sole purpose
of studying tbe cultivation of sugar-beets
and the manufacture of sugar from them.
I was admitted to witness tneir most
secret processes where other men have
been excluded. I was greeted as a friend.
They said they whold extend to tbe
'Sugar King,' as they called me, every
courtesy and every facility to Jearn their
methods, although, they Baid, 1 had prac
tically come to destroy them.
'â¢Germany," continued the speaker,
after the applause bad subsided, "Ger
many manufactures 1,800,000 tons of beet
sugar every year, of whicn they only con
sume at home 400,000 or 600,000 tons. The
Government grams bounties to the manu
facturers, so that they are .enabled to com
pete in the markets of the world. We do
not ask so much. I know taat we have
better opportunities here in this great
country. I am not afraid of France or
Austria or Germany, or any other country.
All tbat I ask or that you need ask is that
our Government gives us some protection
on oar product as against the foreign
manufacturer. [Applause.] Over there
the workmen are paid at an average of two
marks a day. I shall pay roy men an
average of $2 a day. [Applause] I am
not a man to put down tap price or labor.
I will not do it. Instead, I uphold it.
"I have many a time said that if the
people of California would heip me I
could supply not only this State with its
sugar consumption but could send away
60,000,000 tons. [Applause.] Now, beets,
my friends, are the salvation of the farm
er. Cereals have been overworked and
they need a rest. Its cultivation will go
far toward making this the greatest State
in the Union, which I am sure is its ulti
mate destiny. Two Englishmen talked o!
starling the beet-sugar industry oa that
island. Tney inquired of an expert if
sugar-beets could not be grown there.
'Yes,' was the reply, 'but the first 'thing
to be done is to get a shotgun and kill off
all the English tarraers and put Germans
in their places.' [Laughter.] They pay
wages over tnere of from $6 to $8 a month.
I do not intend to oporess labor tbat way.
I intend, without doing so. to keep in this
business until I have established here the
greatest sugar refinery that will ever be
built on earth." [Tremendous ai.plause.l
Hon. W. J. Hill followed. He said:
I realize with the poet tbat there is a tide in
the affairs of men which taken at the flood
leads on to lortune; that there is a tide in the
affairs of cities which, taken at the flood, leads
to prosperity for all citizens. I believe that
that tide has come to Salinas City. This im
mense multitude testifies to it. We have come
here to confer Vith this distinguished gentle,
man, whose name is a household world not
only in this country but over ihe entire world,
gnce the establishment by Mr. Spreckels at
Watsonville of the mear factory the farmers
have had ample opportunity 10 test the soil of
thin valley for the growing of sugar beets,
and with the greater demand to be created by
his immense lactory, we may expect to see the
whole valley, clotntd in its beautiful green or
chards, to spring up and Monterey Bay be
crowded with the white wings of commerce,
ior the establishment of such a factory here
must be followed by other enterprises, and our
3000 population will multiply quickly into
15.000. J
In conclusion, I may give you thii simple
recipe; To banish hard times and increase
our shekels, let us prow sugar-beets ana sell
them to SprecJcels. [Laughter and applause.]
Edward Rerwick of Monterey said:
It is a great pleasure to me, after being
thirty-one years a farmer in Monterey County,
to have the opportunity to BDeaJc to such a
large audience on the sweetest subject that
could be selected. The farmer has a great
many kicks. Mr. Spreckeis Is here to remove
all the causes of them. One of the cause.* it
that there is no money in the crops. He will
remove that. They kick because they cannot
change their crops with profit. Tbe land
itself also kicks on that. Mr. Spreckels is here
to remove the cause. The laud will have a
change and tne farmer will have change in
his pocket. Like Richelieu, we nave a man
who knows no such word as fail. He bag
erased the word from his lexicon.
William Vanderhurst said :
There are topics and there are occasions
when an ordinary man may become eloquent,
even if he never was before. lam a farmer to
some extent. We know that the land here is
our soul. About the only thing that can be
grown upon it is barley. Even tnat cannot be
rai-ed 01 such quality that it can be put on
foreign markets. U can only be sold et home.
It has been discovered that the land will grow
beets in great abundance; not only that, but
the growing of them cures the land. A!te*a
few years of beet culture the land produces
barley of the best and in greater quantity, as
well as other things. The establishment of the
big Spreckels factory will be a boon to this
whole valley, the State and the country.
W. C. Waiers, Mr. Spreckela' manager
at Watbonville, said :
As you are aware Mr. Bpreckels proposes to
put up here a sugar factory thai shall repre
sent the progress and intelligence of a hun
dred years in that line. What is necessary to
a sugar factory is sugar beets. The factory at
Watsonville has been In operation for a num
ber of years. Every year the product haÃ in
creased and the growth of the beet with it.
This has enabled the farmer to enter a new and
profitable fieid. Tbe average yalue of the prod
uct is about $48 per acre. From this tnere are
no tips or *'commlssions>" to be deductedâ no
laid a* emeu. He seÂ»U directly to the factory.
His only expenses are his help and hauling,
which amount to from $20 to $30 an acre, so
that the farmer has a net profit of about $20 to
$30 an acre, which is more than the gross re
ceipts from land planted in cereals. The fac
tory of Mr. Spreckels will be so large that it
will dispose of the beets before rain comes.
This Mr. Spreckels said : "Yes, we got
caught last year. It wouldn't have mat
tered in a cold country, but here with
some delay tne beets began growing a
lone, thin sprout like whiskers, which
carriea off the sugar. The beets mu-t
have a certain percentage of sugar to be
purchasable, and these fell below the per
centage. However, I told Mr. Waters
that I could stand it better than the poor
farmers, so we ran them all in. With our
big factory there will be no such trouble.
I am an old man, but I still keep learning
every day." [Laushter.]
Hon. John R. Hebbron offered the fol
lowing resolution, which was adopted with
a tiger:
Resolved, We, the citizens of Salinas Valley,
in mass-meeting assembled, realizing the im
portance and appreciating the benefits to be
derived from the establishment of a beet-sugar
factory and refinery in this vailey. as proposed
by Hon. Claus Spreckels, hereby promise to
aid and assist the most laudable enterprise to
the extent of our ability, and assure him of
our most hearty eo-operaiiou.
"I wish to aay," interjected Mr. Ber
wick, "that I noticed a magnificent build
ing being erected on the principal street
here. 1 inquired about it, and they said,
'Oh, that is being built on sugar beets.' "
[Laughter], The building referred to is
owned by thu Baldwin Bros., extensive
growers of beets.
"Now fellow citizens," said Mayor Har
ris, "tnis is a serious matter, to tbe im
portance of which you must fully awaken.
You are expected to give your pledge that
you will undertake the cultivation of
beets and fulfill the pledge, so that they
may be at hand when wanted. This mad
has come here with his immense capital
and practically laid it at your feet. It is
a great and golden opportunity, and we
must do our part. It is the greatest en
terprise of the kind in the world. We
must secure it for Salinas Valley."
This was greeted with applause, as if to
give assurance. Upon motion of John
Hebbron a committeeof ten was appointed
for the purpose of ascertaining what
amount ot acreage may b6 pledged for the
purpose of raising sujrar beets. The chair
man will carefully select the members, a.
majority ol whom must be farmers. A
formal and standing vote of thanks was
tendered to Mr. Spreckels and three rous
ing cheers were given for the factory and
three more for Mr. Spreckels, and the
meeting adjourned. Mr. Spreckels re-'
niained to meet the farmers individually,
to shake them by the hand and to give
auy information they might desire. They
crowded around him, numbers Asking
question?. He stated that the factory
would consume the product of at least
30,000 acres per year.
" "1 have come here to bu/ld this factory,"
he said in answer to a question. "All I
ask is tbat the farmers produce the beets.
I will buy them. I ask no favors of. any
kind. I shall buy and pay for the site and
put up the factory myself. I ask no pres
ents or bonuses from the people. - I shall
have no partners in the enterprise what
ever."

Far- Reaching JÂ£nterpriae.~ 7~'C '
BALINAS, Cal., Aug. Lâ The banquet
in honor of Claus .' Spreckels at the Abbott
House to-night was, perhaps, the" most
notable ever given in Monterey County. - ,
,' At. the two large , tables^ that extended
the entire length of tbe big dining-room,
were gathered the front rank business and
. professional men of the county. l The room
and tables were strewed with powers and
vines. ' .. r ..'Cw; '"â¢â ;.:'â¢'-â  : 'r'WÃs&
William Vanderhurst sat at tbe table as
toastmaster. On his right hand sat the
guest of honor. When the oysters and
the long line that came after them had
finally given place to black coffee and
cigars Mr. Vanderhurst .tapped his glass
and had undivided attention.
In a few pleasant words he stated the
entente of the occasion and called upon
the Mayor to extend to the guesfthe nos
pitality of the city. In like brief and
fitting language the Mayor did so and
was applauded for it. Speakma; to the
toast, "Our Honored Guest," Henry An
dresen said :
Mr. Toastmaster, our "honored guest this
evening occupies a peculiarly enviable posi
tion. He haa come among us. asking nothing
and to give everything. He comes among us
as the foremost exponent of the beet-sugar
industry in this great country.
HU'knowledge haa not been gathered from a
single State, not irom a single country, but
the great world has been his field of st udy.
He has beard the principles underlying this
marvelous industry discussed in the'soDorous
tones of the German tongne; he has heard the
suave Frenchman with his inimitable polite
ness dilate upon his experie ice in th Is field o
enterprise; everywhere throughout the wide
world, wherever the sod i.as nourished the
seed of the sugar beet, wherever knowledge
could be gained, he has gone, traveling thou
sands of miles of the boisterous sea, wandering
in strange lands among strange peoples, inde
fatigable in his effort to gain a thorough un
derstanding of this, industry.
AnditisDuta just and deserved statement
to say tliat no man to-day, go where you may,
possesses as thorough and comprehensive
knowledge of this enterprise as our guest.
And besides his knowledge be possesses the
revenue of a principality that enab es
him to make practical illustration of the
knowledge thus gained; and uuduutjtodly it is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, lÂ»yÂ«.
a source of pre-eminent satisfaction that the
great wealth of which he is possessed was
gained in the legitimate channels of commerce,
the fruits of a powerful personality and an un
tiring energy and a pronounced ability.
It did not spring; from a fortunate striice in
oil; it did not spring from the discovery of a
rich vein of gold-bearing quartz; it did not
spring from Blunder and corruption, but it is
tbe legitimate achievement of a striking ca
reer signally sueceseful.
When we are conscious of all this, it is not
strange that we listen with the utmost respect
and attention and with a calm assurance and
confidence \vHen our guest speaks upon his
favored topic.
This confidence, Mr. Spreckels, is undoubt
edly felt by our citizens and farmers t j-day,
and ttiey extend to you the welcoming hand,
deeply appreciative of the great benefit that
you propose to bestow upon them and with an
abiding confidence in the sincerity of your
purposes.
They recognise your strength ; they recog
nizeyourability; they feel tnat the austerity of
wealth does not cloak you in a forbidding
mantle, but that your sympathies are for the
man who toils for bread for himself and his
family.
Should this great enterprise which you pro
pose be consummated, it will remain an en
during mark to your achievements and In tne
years when you shall be no more,
tne toiling thousands, who through
your magnanimity are enabled to
live in comparative comfort will cherish in
their hearts a warm and tender recollection of
Claus Spreckels, more enduring than the cold
shaft of stone which for the great majority of
millionaires must speak their eulogy to the
passing stranger.
I cannot express myself as I feel in regard to
the manner in which you hsve received me
here. 1 can only say that if you will put your
shoulders to the wheel we will push this
wagon along and will land the big beet sugar
lactory within the borders of Salinas. Gentle
men, "keep at work. 1 thank you. [Great
applause.]
. "Our Manufactories and Their Results"
was the topic given to John J. Wyatt
Manufacturers, he said, made cities big.
Salinas Valley had the possibilities that
went with vast raw materials. Utilized,
the money resulting'would circulate in the
valley.
Claus Spreckels was about to open the
way toward great commercial success.
Salinas would spring into world-wide fame
as the city having the greatest sugar fac
tory on earth.
B. V. Sarpent responded to "The Sugar
Beet and Its Development." He gave
some remarkable figures, showing the
rapid development of the industry and
the amount of money which has been got
in circulation by the Wationville factory.
The question had been" asked: "Can
Claus Spreckels carry out his big plan-?"
The speaker said lie bad for an answer
only to point to the accomplishment at
Watsonville which, before its success, had
been declared to be' impossible. Claus
Spreckels had then Baid: "I have never
yet failed and will not in this."
"He has. kept his word," said the
speaker. "The man who has made Hunt
ington, the greatest railroad magnate of
the world, *bow the knee to him ;
tbe man who could go to Philadelphia
and swallow* the sugar trust, digest
it cobblestones and all and return to Cali
fornia in serene health and some $10,000,
--000 batter off. will not fail in this under
taking. It behooves us to pin him and
bold up his hands to our inmost ability."
[Applause.]
C. F. Lacey was assigned to and fittingly
responded to the.toast, "Our Transporta
tion Facilities."
A letter addressed to George Armstrong
of this city by F. A. Hihn'of Santa Cruz
was read, he regretting his inability to be
present. Tbe letter said:
It is said that at lent once in each man's life
an opportunity is offered to him for honor and
wealth. This seems to me tbe opportunity for
Salinas City. 'Avail yourselves of it and the
whole, valley will become the most prosperous
point of ttio" Pacific Coast.
I hope to hear before night that it Is defi
nitely determined that Claus Spreckels 1 great
beet-sugftr factory will be located a.t or near
Salinas CJty.
Brief remarks were made by others, of
guests, and the banquet broke up after
midnight with a final toast to the guest of
honor, in eiving which he was hailed as
"Sir" Claus Spr^ekels. The guestrefused
to accept this. â¢ He said :
"If'you want to giv&rae'a title, I have
two: I was a colonel on the Governor's
staff and Idm the â¢sugar king.' When I
shall have built this big refinery, how
ever, I will no longer be the 'sugar king,'
but the 'emperor of the sugar industry. "
[Laughter and great applause,!
The affair was altogether very auspicious
for the bie enterprise. Mr. Spreckels â¢wirl
board a train at 6 o'clock in the morning
to go southward to look over .more terri
tory that he hopes to become a factor in
the sugar enterprise.
FOUR THOUSAND PERISH,
Awful Tidal Wave- Visits a
Chinese City in Kiangsu
Province.
Rice Fields Destroyed, Cattle Drowned
and Survivors Are Threatened
With Starvation.
SHANGHAI. China, Aug. I.â News has
just been received here of a terrible disas
ter in the neighborhood of Haichau in the
northeastern part oi Kiangsu, the province
in which this city is situated. The disas
ter was similar to that which recently
overwhelmed the coast villages, in North
ern Japan.
> On Sunday last, the 26th of July,* a huge
.bank of watÂ«Â»r five miles in length formed
in tbe Yellow Sea and rushed on tbe shore
with irresistible fores. It swept inland
over the low lands for miles and carried
everything before it. Many villages were
destroyed and all their inhabitants
drowned. In many cases whole families
perished.
At this time it is entirely impossible to
give any close estimate of tbe loss of life.
It is asserted, however, tbat fully 4000
lives were lost. This is regarded as very
conservative and some believe, knowing
the character of the country over which
the wave swept, that the loss will prove to
be more nearly double that number.
Tbe loss of pioperty wits very heavy.
Rice fields were entirely destroyed, and
all tne cattle were drowned. Those who
managed to escape the effects of the
wave are in a destitute condition and are
threatened with starvation.
Those who are familiar with the country
in tbe neighborhood of Haichau believe
that when the full extent of the disaster
has been ascertained it will be found much
more serious than reported.
The country is densely populated; in
fact it is one of the most thickly settled
parts of China, and as it is all low there
was no place' to which the people could fly
when tbe flood came. For miles the coun
try is little more than a gieat marsh,
whic-h was occupied by a great number of
rice fields.
All over tbe region struck by the wave
there are small bouses. Most of these
were washed away with their inhabitants.
In many cases entire families were de
stroyed, and none were left to report the
loss of life, so that the authorities must
depend to a great extent on the bodies
found to make up their estimates of the
number drowned.

POWERS NOT IN ACCORD
An' Open Split Occurs Over the
Question of Blockading
tbe Island.
INTERFERENCE OF THE CZAR.
Various Intrigues Precede the Ap
proaching Visit of the Ru er
of .the Russias.
BERLIN,' Germant, Auk. I.â Following
close upon the conferences between Chan
cellor yon Houenlohe and pount Golu
chowski, the Austrian .Minister of Foreign
Affairs, at the former's chateau at Alt
Ausse, and the snmmoning to Rome pf
Count Nigra, the Italian Embassador.to
Austria, comes the arraneement for a
meeting between the Marquis di Rudini,
the Italian Prime Minister, and C< n'nt
Goluchowski. The meetiDg wilL probably
be at some place on the Italian frontier.
There is no mystery attaching to all
these movements. They are caused by
the situation in' Crete and Macedonia, in
both of "which places the revolt against
Turkish rule has again excited the deep
interest of statesmen in the Eastern ques
tion, which has long been a smoldering
firebrand in the councils of Europe. The â 
official press here-and in Vienna no longer
pretend that; the co.nce'rt of the powers ex
ists relative to Crete. An open diplomatic
split has occurred over the question of 4
blockade of the island by the combined
powersâa proposal which had its initia
tive in St. Petersburg. The proposal is
attributed to the Czar's personal interven
tion, he desiring to relieve his uncle, King
George of Greece, from his embarrassing'
position toward his subjects, who heartily
support the aspirations of the Cretans to
cut loose from Turkey, while at the same
time -maintaining the Turkish regime,
through the initiative of -St.- Petersburg.
Austria took off the responsibility for the
proposal.'
Probably Emperor Francis- Joseph was
prompted to do this in view of the Czar's
approaching visit. Germany has assented
as a matter of course, and. France has ad
hered'to Russia. Combined naval action
seemed assured, when Great Britain, with
out absolutely -declining to be.a party to
the arrangements, intimated that the
powers ought first to attempt to pacify
the Cretans by compelling the Porte to
give its assent to reasonable demands for
Â£he betterment of the condition of the
Christian ihbkbitantsol Crete. The Mar
quis dj Rudini is understood to gide with
the British Prime Minister in his views
of fhe action that is to be taken by the
powers.
No German warship was to take part in
the blockaae. In view of the opposition
of Great Britain it is doubtful now jvhetner
Austria will join the blockade, and an iso
lated Franco-Russia-n demonstration is,
according to official opinion here, improb
able. The Neuste Nachrichten says that
British warships are assembling at Gibral
tar, and that this points out that Great
Britain is prepared for emergencies in the
Mediterranean, and that she, having aban
doned her policy for the preservation of-
Turkey, is ready to seize what advantage
the can from the breaking up of that em
pire.
The Vossische Zeitung declares that the
establishment of a Dlookade would mean
the giving up of the Cretan Christians to
â the mercy of the Turks by cutting off their
supplies, which enable them to defend
themselves agains oppression and outrage.
It is a shameful spectacle, the paper adds,
to see Christians acting as bailiffs for the
Sultan and handing a helpless people over
to Turkish vengeance.
The National Zeitung approves of the
blockade. It says it is the view 'in the
official circle that if the Cretans desire to
liberate themselves -they must do so by
the strength of their ow.n arms, though
it does not. point out how they are to
procure arms if the warships of the out
side powers blockade their coast*.
Emperor William arrived at Kiel yester
day from nis cruise in northern waters.
His trip has benefited him and he is en
joying fine health. He received his brother^
Prince Henry of Prussia, tne Prinoe and
Princessof Oldenburg and Duke Frederick
of Schleswig-Holstem. He told Prince
Henry, who is an admiral, that the com
ing naval maneuvers would be unusual
in interest, as' they were planned to test
the strategic yalue of tbe Baltic canal.
Fifty-four 'vessels, besides the transports
and torpedo-boats, would traverse ' the
canal in the formation designed to meet
an enemy in the Baltic. The maneuvers
will take place at the end of tbe current
month, and if the evolutions are successful
the fleet wili return to the North Sea on
September 3. Tue maneuvers will be
watched with strained anxiety. It is feared
that the working of the locks and the
depth of water in the canal will balk the
plans of the admiralty.
The date of the Cz3r's visit is known
only to Emperor William and the highest
officials, and the same secrecy is observed
concerning his visit to Austria. Even
high court officials do not know when he
is coming, or if they do know they are
guarding the secret closely. The dates
given by tbe newspapers are unreliable.
They were it-sued from St. Petersburg for
the purpose of misleading the public. All
that is known is that the Czar am] Czarina
will visit Emperor William in August.
They will afterward visit the Duke of
Cumberland atGmunden, and their move
ments have not been decided unon fur
ther. The railways in Austria over which
the Csar and Czarina will travel will be
especially inspected and will be guarded
throughout. Despite tbe statement that
has appeared in .French newspapers, it is
doubtful if the Czar will visit Paris.

STRUCK BY A BIG WAVE
Passengers on the Cunard Line

NEW YORK, N. V., Aug. 1.-The pas
sengers of the Cuna'rd line steamer Etru
ria, which vessel arrived nere to-day, had
a rude awakening about 2 o'clock on last
Tuesday morning and were thrown into a
state bordering on panic. It was 'the work
of a huge wave which had mounted the
Â£tr.uria's .port bow during a Â«gale and'
smashed her forward ironwork, deluging
the fore Hold, unshipped ttie vessel's bell,
wrecked the screen stanchions, rusned
through the port companionways and in
vaded Jbe rooms of the passengers.
. Many of tbe passengers were thrown
from .their berths by the impact. Luggage
and beds were drenched. Scores ol fright
ened passengers rushed from their cabins,
some calling forjnends and others for the
ship's # ofl3cers. After the wave boarded
tbe vessel she was eased off and laid to for
two hours and a half. . The storm by that
t;n>o subsided and temporary repairs had
been effected. No one aboard' was injured.

An Attempt -to Select New York as
tbe Site Meets With Bedded
Opposition.
LONDON, Enqlajjd, Aug. I.â This was
the last day of the International Socialist
Trades Congreis. # Aside from an acad
emic discussion of' Socialist questions its
results have been nil. It was decided to-"
day tbat the next congress be held in Ger
many in 1899. If political difficulties in
that country prevented the holding of the
congress then it would be held in Pans in
1900. It was also decided that anarchists
would not be admitted as delegates to the
next congress.
Prior to their adjournment the delegates
hurriedly adopted a number ot resolutions,
including one in favor cf granting amnesty
to political prisoners. When the question
of tbe next congress was under discussion
the American delegates proposed that New
â¢York be selected as the place of meeting.
They said they would arrange to charter a
steamer to convey delegates from Europe
to the United States, but the proposal was
rejected on aocount of the expense. * â¢
Softie of the trades union delegates urged
that future congresses should discuss prac
tical Questions and not ideal states. Many
of the delegates vehemently protested
against this proposal, and especially the
Frenchmen.
The anarobists who had been refused
admission to the congress as delegates had.
ensconced themselves in the gallery of the
hall, and there signified' their* disapproval
of the proposal by shouting, "Long live
anarchy."
After cheering for socialism and singing
"Auld Lang Syne" and the "flflarseillaise"
the uongreys adjourned.
In conversation tfith a representative of
the United Press to-day, twoÂ» of the Amer
ican delegates, Matthew Maguire, who
represented the' New Jersey socialist
unions, and Lucien Sanoil of thÂ«) Socialist
Trade and Labor Alliance, .said that the
congress had virtually reaffirmed the reso
lutions adopted by past congresses, but
more firmly than ever befoie. It had es
tablished opposition to anarchism and the
necessity of a united movement by the
1 economic and political forces of labor.

THE CHAMPIONS,
Captured the Four-Oared
Race in Gallant
Style.
LED BY JAKE GAUDAUR
The English Crew Mates a
Spurt, but Cannot Catch
the Leaders.
HALIFAX SOWERS NOT IN
Grand View as the Cracks of England
and America Race Almost
Abreast.
HALIFAX, N. S.. Aug.* I.â The inter
national four-oared race to-day for the
world's championship was won by the
Canadian crew, the English crew second
and the Halifax crew third. Time, 18 :32.
It was a grand sight under the setting
sun as the crack crews of England and
America rowed toward the finish line al
most abreast, the Britishers straining
every nerve to put their boat in front,
while the Canadian- American four main
tained their easy, comfortable style of
rowing with which they started, and
crossed the line a winner by over five
lengths. When the crews were sent about
7:10 o'clock there was a light ripple on the
water, but not enough to interfere with
high speed.
Four crews started in the race, as fol
lows: English crewâ Bubear, Haines,
Barry and Gibson; Canadian- American
orew â Gaudaur, Surnan, Hackett and
Rogers; Halifax erew â Lynch, Holland,
Shea and Brennan; St. John erew â Hefler,
Van Buskirk, Boutiler and Boutijer.
All four boats made a start, catching
the water well together, with the St. John
men pulling a very heavy stroke as they
forged to the front. For a few minutes
they seemed to have a slight advantage
over the others, but it was of brief dura
tion. Three of the other boats pushed
past them before the eighth of a mile had
been Covered. Gaudaur's four, with a
graceful, steady and never- varying stroke,
took the lead in position as soon as the
real struggle began, and they lost it only
once while the race lasted.
Dipping tneir oars at a rate of thirty
seven timed to the minute they never
seemed to increase or decrease their stroke,
but went ahead like a piece of superbly
regulated machinery until the contest was
finished. Down the whole length of the
'course to the turn, one and a half miles
from the start, they were closely pressed
by the Halifax and English crews, but
they never lost their position until the
turn had been made and then regained it
so quickly that it was easy to see they
Were 9 superior crew, destined to capture
the $1000 -prize.
Half a mile from the start the .Bedford
crew, already a quarter of a mile behind
the others, dropped out. At this point
Bubear's boat was heading the Halifax
crew by two lengths with Bt. John follow
ing close.
The Canadians were just then getting
clear of the Englishmen., and the fisher
man four of Halifax were setting the pace,
forcing tiie other's to work hard or drop
astern. The local crew, rowing splendidly,
gained slowly on the British oarsmen. A
mile from the start they were abreast of
them. The three boats sped toward the
turning- buoys and so close together that
to tne spectators they seemed to be neck
and neck. The Canadians bad been doing
a little bad steerinsr, and to get around
their own buoy had to make a lone turn.
The Englishmen were rowing hard, their
object apparently being to eahauat the
Gaudaur crew, but the latter were in too
good condition.
The Canadian-American team squared
or home a length to the erood. The Hali
ax crew got around so rapidly that it set
out on tne homestretch with a slight ad-
Vantage over the Englishmen with the St.
John men nearly four lengths behind.
When half a mile from home Gaudaur's
men led by two lengths. The St. John
crew was a quarter of a mile astern. A
quarter of a mile further on the English
men got even witn the Haligonians; then
they forged ahead and bent all their ener
gies to overtaking the leaders. Half a
mile from home the English ment put
forth their supreme effort, increasing their
lead on the Halifax crew and drawing
toward the Canadians at a rapid rate.
A third of a mile from the finish they
had out down the gap to ooc and a half
lengths, and before the last quarter was
reached the two were almost abreast. In
these positions, with the bow of the Eng
lish boat less than a length from the bow
of the Canadians, they approached the fin
ishing line, rowing a splendid race.
Bubear and his mates were, however,
very tired and were unable to keep the
pace. Again the Canadian four drew
away from them, then slowed down a lit
tle, apparently satisfied that they could
win without any trouble.
Half a dozen lengths from the finish
line tRe Englishmen fouled a stakeboat
which had floated out of place. For a few
seconds they stopped rowing, losing more
than a length, while Gaudaur's msn
crossed the line between five and six
lengths ahead.
The time of the winning boat was 18:32
The Englishmen finished in 18:45,. and the
Halifax orew in 19:20. The St. John crew
was beaten by about half a mile.

THAT DOCTORED PLATFORM.
Bryan Say That Xt Will He Duly Gir
eulatmd in Correct JFortn.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Aug. I.â The atten
tion of Mr. Bryan was called to-night to
the statement concerning alleged tam
pering with the Democratic platform so
as to make it contain the rejected amend
ment proposed by Senator Hill. Mr.
Bryan refused to be interviewed on the
subject, but said be supposed the National
Committee would -at the proper time cir
culate the platform in its correct form.
A number of telegrams have been received
by Mr. Bryan to-day in regard to the
matter and it is understood he has an
swered them in accordance with the state
ment given.
Circumstances may make it necessary
for Mr. Bryan to change his route from
Lincoln to Chicago. The change will be
announced as soon as decided on. Mr.
Bryan will not maKe any set speeches be
tween Lincoln and New York, but he will
probably address crowds at many places
en route. The journey through parts of
lowa and Illinois will be made in the
daytime and he will also spend the morn
ing and afternoon through Indiana, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It is evi
dent "that every demonstration in his
favor along the route of his journey East
will be responded to with semi-political
addresses such as those he delivered in
Illinois, Missouri and Nebraska on his
way to Lincoln.
Among Bryan's callers to-day was
Daniel Flanagan, editor of the Kenton
(Ohio) Democrat, who assured the Demo
cratic nominee that Ohio wasbv no means
a sure Republican State and that the.Re
publican managers realized it.
Hon. Richard P. Bland, Mr. Bryan's
unsuccessful competitor for the Demo
cratic nomination, will accompany Mr/
Bryan to New York and will probably
speak at the Madison-square Garden meet
ing. He will go as the nominee's guest.
Mr. Bland is expected here Friday.

TRYING TO PLACE THE BLAME.
Charge That Two Train? Wtere Racing

ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Aug. Lâ
Now that the excitement has subsided
somewhat, the exact number of fatalities
and injured in Thursday's accident is
definitely known. The dead number forty
four and forty-three peraona were seriously
enough hurt to be taken to the hospital.
Of those in the hospital twenty-eight were
so far recovered to-day as to be able to go
to their homes. Of the fifteen persons re
maining in the hospital, several are suf
fering from terrible injuries, the nature of
which makes, their recovery doubtful.
The uncertainty as to the exact number
killed arose from the confusion and ex
citement following the accident and con
dition 6f some of the bodies which were
dismembered, one being headless.
Several bodies were at first wrongly
identified, and this added to the confusion
of identification. One case was that of
the body of a man who was positively
identified as Samuel Murphy of Bridge
ten. Murphy turned up alive at his home
and the body remained unknown until
to-day, when it was identified as that of
Patrick Feigan, retired liquor dealer of
Philadelphia. All the bodies were fully
identified to-day.
The ordinary quiet and order which pre
vails in a hospital returned to-day to the
sanitarium after yesterday's harrowing
scenes. The first agony of grief was over
for the uninjured and the hurt were rest
ing more quietly. The seriously wounded
have rooms to themselves and their rel
atives were admitted to them and passed
the day. in watchful and tender ministra
tions at their bedsides.
Althpugh terribly injured, the principal
anxiety of young Charles Homer was for
his affianced wife. She had been with him
when the crash came, and afterward he
lost her and was in an agony of fear over
her fate. Unknown to him, the girl was
slowly dying and unconscious in a room
close to him. Not until afternoon, was the
unconscious girl identified. Then she was
recognized by her uncle as his niece, Lizzie
Bramun. She had been staying with him
at Ocean City and had gone to Bridge'on
to go on the excursion with her friends
and was returning with them home. "When
Homer was told Miss Brannin was in the
hospital, his grief was most affecting and
throughout thre.day he made constant in
quiry as to her condition.
The story that the Reading train was
racing when the accident occurred con
tinues to be repeated, but it cannot be
substantiated with any accuracy. If the
two trains were racing the engineers were
violating one of the strictest rules of their
roads; A man .whose name is withheld,
and who witnessed.the accident, says the
trains were not racing. This man, who
will.be a witness at the inquest, was riding
a bicycle on the road by the block tower.
The bicycle rider saw the shift of th $ men
in the signal tower as the day operator
left and the night operator took charge.
As the West Jersey excursion train ap
proached the tower- he noticed it slacken
its speed and saw the Reading express
coming. .
He saw the increased speed of the ex
cursion train as Engineer Greinerturned
on steam to rush his train, 'if possible,
over the crossing, as the white signals au
thorized him to. do. Then came the crash,
ana the man on the bicycle, when he re
covered from the shock of the sight, sped
away for the city for assistance. The im
pression of the m.an is that the Camden
and Atlantic express came along about
two min utes after the crash and that the
two trairts were not racing.
No verification of the racing between
the two trains can be obtained from tho
railroad people nere, as they either refuse
to talk or flatly deny that the engineers
could have been racing. Nevertheless,
people who daily use the two roads assert
that races occur frequently on the level
stretch.

RUSSIA TO STOP
TURKISH ABUSES,
The Czar Learns the Truth
About Armenia and
Crete.
MISRULE MUST CEASE.
England Is Exercised Over the
Fate of the Jameson
Raiders.
SOCIALIST CONGRESS FIASCO.
British Naval Maneuvers That Were
Disappointingâ Amsrican Politics
Discussed.
LONDON, Ekg., Aug. Lâ lt Is more than
surmised in official quarters here that
there has been a sort of palace revolution
in Russia and that Prince Lobanoff if not
overthrown has been divested of his un
limited power as Foreign Minister. He
has been from the beginning hand in
glove with the German Emperor; ao much
so as amply to justify the original suspi
cion that his appointment was managed
from Berlin. The credit for his defeat is
now given to the Czar's mother, who never
has forgotten tbat ehe is a Danish
princess, and who baUs all things Ger
man. Whether she likes all things English
ia not so clear, but for the moment, at
least, English statesmen think the way
may be opened for a more effective pro-
Christian policy in the Levant. It is un
derstood that between his Greek, English
and Danish relatives the young Czar has
been brought to know the truth about Ar
menia and Crete and to say that Russia
shell no longer play the monstrous part of
the Sultan's supporter in theÂ»Â« crimes
against civilization.
Upon this new basis, I am told, fresh
negotiations are now proceeding among
the powers and it is not impossible that
Germany may rind herself alone or at best
with only Austria's lukewarn assent in
the position of backing up the Turkish
misrule. If all this be true, and there are
numerous indications that it is, then at
last something can be done to break the
shameful deadlock in the East.
It is shown that the Czar's health con
tinues bad and that a distinct anxiety ex
ists least it may never improve. He and
his wife are coming westwar d about a
month hence, visiting Vienna first.
Several dateÃ have been announced, but
it is said that the exact time is still un
settled. Beyond the understanding that
Darmstadt, Copenhagen and Berlin are
on the imperial programme nothing is
knÂ«wn. Paris is feverishly anxious as to
its chances in this list and it is difficult
ctTtaini-y to see how it can with decency
be left out, yet it is also obvious that the
Parisians would make a demonstration
which would throw the whole of the rest
of the journey into the shade. For this
reason it is now suggested that the Czar
will go to all the other places first, then
interpose a period of quiet seaside rest
somewhere^ â perhaps Norway â and then
make the French visit a thing by itself.
Nothing ia clearer about Nicholas than
that he is devoid of military ambitions.
His associations are not with soldiers, and
he has a strong aversion to the martial
element in tbe ceremonies of court life.
This lact makes it possible to view the or
ganized disturbance in Macedonia with
less apprehension than would have been
aroused a few years ago. That they are
being produced under the auspices of the
Macedonian Committee, which gets its
money chiefly from Russian sources, is
now here doubted. There is a feeling,
however, that if the C*ar lives and main
tains even a nomiifal grip on things, these
mischief-makers will not be allowed to go
tne lengths of provoking a war. Unnap
pily, there is always a iarge margin of
chance in Russian politics, and if one pal
ace clique can upset Lobanoff. another
may hoist him to the head of affairs
again, aud, no matter how pacific the
Czar may be, there is a powerful army in
fluence always pulling in the other direc
tion.
The Irish land bill is said now to be
practically certain of getting through the
Lords. The Marqois of Lansdowne yes
terday in proposing it in the upper cham
ber felicitously likened himself to a tame
elephant who was employed driving the
wilder fellows into captivity. This most
aptly describes the situation. No land
lord, whether Irish or English, likes the
pill, but the Government is committed to
it and if it is thrown out there is a moral
certainty that some other bill still less to
their likiuz will have to be passed later on,
hence, thoueh there may be lots of furious
talk, it is not probabte that there will be
much practical obstruction. Dillon has,
risen to the full measure of bis incapacity
in denouncing the' measure while re
luctantly votiug for it. He has neither the
ability to comprehend land biils nor the
modesty to be guided by those who do,
and this latest exhibitionof h,is unfitness
is probably about tbe last that Ireland
needs.
If last week's trial of the Jameson raid
ers was dull to the point of despair, none
pan complain about the lack of dramatic
interest in this week"s developments. Lord
Rusjeil lifted the affair out of the com
monplace on Monday the moment he be
gan his charge to the jury, which not only
made a profound impression on those wh,o
heard it, but has already taken a high
place among historic law-irajung deliver
ances from the English bench. It made
conviction imperative, and although there
was one juror who fully intended to hang
out for disagreement to the bitter end, he
Jound himself committed to a verdict of
guilty under Russell's interrogatories be
fore he understood what nss going on.
The court purposely refrained from mak
ing the convicts first-class misdemeanant*
ro doubt with (he intention of thrusting
this responsibility upon the Home Office.
For one day the Government seemed to
shrink from tnis responsibility aud iet the
. prisoners go to an ordinary prison and be
ciad in convict parb.
However, the papers had worked up
fujh general sympathy by punting long j
accounts of the brutal way in which com
mon convicts were treated, tbat every booy
was clamoring for the intervention of the
crown, and when the Home Secretary an
nounced it yesterday the Commons raised
a cheer from all sides. It is understood
that Kruger intends contending for the
pardon of the raiders, bnt it is doubtful if
this would be acceptable.
This sentimental outburst of the public
probably provides a way for the Govern
ment ou* oi its difficulty concerning
Rhodes. When the conviction of his sub
ordinates was announced.there was a sharp
demand in all quarters that he should be
prosecuted at one*. <ud his own offer to
come home immediately and stand trial
ouly made, the thing more awkward. There
remained, however, tne device of a par-'
liamentary inquiry, and Chamberlain set
UÂ»ia promptly in aiotioa. He aniased aud
delighted the radinals by acceding all
sorts of suggestions of theirs ab<3ut widen
ing the srope ot the inquiry until the work
cut out for it may easily be spun over a
couple of years or more.
Now they see that the prosecution of
Rhodes may be plausibly postponed until
the inquiry ia concluded, and that a re
vulsion of ropuJar feelingr inihecasoof
Jameson makes it likely that the whole
thins will now biow over.
It is obvious, too, that the native war in
Rhodesia is growiHg steadily in import
ance. There are now no friends who can
be relied on, and the whites in the dis
turbed country cannot Â«yen hold their
own much longer, lei alone regain lost
ground. News of a great disaster is daily
feared.
The temptation to gird at Alfred Austin
over the conviction of the raiders, whose
exploit he celebrated, is too strong for
human nature, and he lias been merci
lessly guyed on all sides. In the per
versity of inopportuneness he chose- just
this time to make a speech on Burns at
Irvine, which, as he delivered it, was
mere empty twaddle, but as he wrote it
and published it in the Times contained
an attack on the poet's private life, which
infuriated all Scotland, besides inviting
an imputation of cowardice on himself.
It is gleefully reported, i know not on
what authority, that the Prince of Wales
stipulated that the laureate should write
no oda on the marriage of the Princess
Maud. Certainly none has appeared.
It is also said tnat the Queen is in very
bitter temper over these public slights to
her laureate. Everything about the Queen
now is so carefully shrouded in mystery
that it ia impossible to judge of the value
of any rumors concerning her. It is only
known in a general way that she is the
victim of increasing melancholia, which
does not take gently pen&ive forms, and
that since the recent marriage there have
been persistent reports that she has to
salved never to appear in public again.
Guarded reference to these reports is made
to-day by the way of a semi-official state
ment. It is hoped that some means may
be found of celebrating her sixtieth corona
tion anniversary next summer so that she
may be able to take part in it.
Calamity marked the International So
cialist Congress for its own from the very
outset. The opening demonstration of
Sunday, which had promised to be tne
biggest thing of its kind ever seen, was
literally wasued out of Hyde Park by a
wild deluge of rain.
For the following three days the sessions
were pandemoniums of shrieking- violence,
which the papers described at length as
ttie frenzies of lunatics. In reality they
were more grotesque and savage than
even tue ruost Hostile accounts picture
them. Since the anarchists were at last
thrown out the proceedings have been
more peaceful, but the ridiculous overture
quite sickened the public of the whole
affair and no attention is paid sow to
what they say or do, A resolution that
the state Buould support every scholar
while getting an education, all the way
from tne kindergarten to the university, is
the principal new idea thus far asserted.
This was ooposed stoutly by Sidney
Webb, who besides being a member of the
Fabian Society is the head of the county
councils of the Technical Education Board,
and who pleaded thatovereducation among
the working classes was a grave danger.
His plan was that the state should sup
port only such children as won scholar
ships, thus showing it to be worth while
to further educate them. But Keir Hardie
retorted that scholarships won by compe
tition were unsocialistic, and he earned
with him the whole socialist and most of
the trades union vote, making an immense
majority.
The polyglot difficulties of the present
gathering nave been so tremendous that
many English members say they will
never take part in such a thing again un
less English is made the sole language of
debate.
The big naval maneuvers just finished
show results which were quite unlooked
for. The slower and weaker fleet, with
merely the slight advantage of mist and
dirty weather, completely outmancuvered
the large and fast fleet. In chasing it Â«ot
away and did what it likea alone the Irish
coast. This practical demonstration
frightens Englishmen, for the Germans or
French might have done it as well as Ad
miral Seymour, and the result will be
greater and swifter additions to the navy.
Goldwin Smith, in the .Saturday Review
of to-day, has a lone article on the Ameri
can political situation, which he views
with characteristic gloom.
He makes the point that if Canada were
in tne Union her vote would turn the
scale in favor of honest money and scolds
England for continuing to sever the north
ern fringe of the continent from its
natural affiliations and to attach it to
Europe, whereas if Canada had a voice in
the councils of her own hemisphere she
would be helpful to all concerned.
The late Colonel North was not un
lucky in dying when he did. At a general
meeting of the nitrate company this week
he was openly denounced as a thief, and
at a puDlic sale of his great estate of
Eitnam, including his new castle, which
alone cost him $1,500,000 to build, the
highest bid was only $250,000 and no sale
was made. It is understood that the heirs
will drop altogether his scheme of build
ing the grand northern Monte Carlo, to
be called Northville, on the Belgian coast
just beyond O^tend.
Mrs. Patrick Campbell for some reason
strenuously objects to going to America
and has accordingly withdrawn fiom her
partial engagement with Beerbohrn Tree.
She also nas rejected all English offers
with which she has been dallying aud
wilt take a prolonged rest in the country.
The dramatic season, now flickering to
a close, has been hopelessly undistin
guished, so iar as the native dran.a goes.
Such clays as have succeeded have been
almost invariably continual adaptations,
liKe 'For the Crown," "Chili Widow" and j
the "Queen's Proctor." Almost ail the
money made has been in the line of fatu
ous musical comedies, no less than aine of
which are now running at the West End
places.
Possibly because of Mary Andorson's
lead we shall shortly have a flood of
reminiscences fro*n the queens of the
stage. Ristori's memoirs are to be issued
at Milan next month, and Ellen Terry
Bernhardt and Duse are already giving
final proofs of similar works.

SAN â¢: EAFAEL, * Cat..-,, Aug. , I.â Judge
, Angeiotti to-day â  rendered his decision on #
final account of the executors in the es
tate of James M. Donahue, deceased, and
decree of distribution of the money and
! property of . the large estate. The Judge
handled the complicated matters involved,
, including nice points of probate law, a
â  mass of intricate business detail, calling
for the skill of an expert, and the delicate
1 adjustment of conflicting interests, with
1 the hand of a master, and it is doubtful if
any objection will be raised by the persons
affected, although the Judge himself sug
: gested on one point that an appeal might
be taken. The decree distributed nearly
$500,000 in money, and the estate enjoys
the distinction of being t much - larger at
the division than at the commencement of
probate, which is not at all usual in such
cases. â  ; : . '. â  . ' .â¢ -.-â¢'â  ..-â¢'â¢ â v â â  â¢
The first item is the final account of the
executors, embracing tbe period between
April 25, 1893, and May 23, 1896. None- of
the many persons in interest has pre
j sented objection to any item of disburse
ment, and evidence shows that the ac
counts, so far as concern receipts ana dis
bursements, are correct. . â¢ â¢ ".
According thereto, the balance of cash
remaining in the hands of the excators at
the date of filing the account was $112,

Other property, -real' and personal, also
remains on hand to the â¢ value of $40,000.
Various accounts are presented by the ex
ecutors for adjudication, which the Judge
takes up and disposes of as follows: \
... Firstâ The claim of C. F. Hanlon, attorney
for Executor Burgin, for moneys advanced,
embraces different items, which appear to
have been necessary, amounting to $126 25. .
Second â The claims of Butler, . Notman,
Jaime and Mynderse for legal services in New
Yorkâ 95, was allowed. , ' :. â¢
Thirdâ The claim of D* A. Emith for service
as secretary, and in settling litigation and re
covering possession of certain mining prop
erty in Placer Countyâ â allowed.
The executors recommended the payment. ,'
Â Fourthâ Family allowances: Under the or
der made by. court In -1890 there is due the
I widow. Belle W. ; Donahue, . now Belle W,
Sprague, for support of minor child 'of | de
ceased, $10,000. This is for family allowances
from October 3, 1894, to June 3, 1896.
Firth â * Compensation* of â â¢ executors. Total
i cash received by executors during administra
tion is $1,247,048 44. Value of property other
than cash remaining on hand is $40,000. To
tal $1,287,048 44, upon which commissions
arc to be calculated- at rates given in section
I 1618, C. C. P. This gives a total of $14,690 48
as commissions to which executors are entitled
by law. - ,'-.
The executors also request that they be al
lowed for special sesvic^s as far as permitted
by statute, I. c., half amount of commissions
allowed by law, which' would be $7345 24.
The meguitnde of the interests, the condition
of danger in which* these interests were, the
volurbe of litigation, etc., ail required unusual
ability, industry and honesty. - The executors
had; these qualifications, and have done their
duty. But ;ney have been liberally dealt with
and have each received .over $5300 from the
Kew York administration. I therefore feel
that the allowance must be limited to $2000,
making tho total compensation of the two ex
ecutors-f 16,690 48. . ;â¢â¢: â¢ ;.
Compensation of the firm of Hahley,
Hayes, McErjerney & Bradley, attorneys f lot
Executor' P. J. McGlynn, from January 5,
1893, to date. $15,000, has been suggested as
fair, and this amount has . been consented to
by the attorney for re. Sprague. , But the
court must consider the interests of the minor
child, and the various charities, and deter
mine for itself what is a fair compensation. I
have concluded to allow $12,500. : : "^ ' -
I Seventhâ of Hepburn Wilkins, ap-
I pointed in 1890 attorney for various unrepre
sented parties, in which capacity he served
until August, 1893: He has already received
$3000. A total allowance ot $3500 .for the
nearly three years' service In my opinion

$500.: -â :.â ;..'. â¢--.â¢: V :;v.
Mr. Wilkins was allowed for service as guar

child. He lias also obtained for her by stipula
tion $44,000 that must , otherwise. .have gone

property of which he had the power of testa
mentary disposition. This excludes the wife's
half of the community property. .-
To ascertain the amount of disposable assets
we must add to the $344,969 68 remaining on
band the amount already, paid;. to general
legatees, viz., $120 478 44, which Rives us a
total â¢of $405,448 08. .Not exceeding one
third of this can tie devoted to charitable
legacies, via. : $153,149 36. â¢ â¢ â  l
As regards the fountain monument trust;
Judge; Angeiotti argued fully and very
clearly the .status . of the bequest for, the
public fountain, at the intersection ot
Bush,. Market : and. Battery streets, San
Francisco.. The will, gives ''for a public.
fountain, dedicated to mechanics, in mem
ory of my father," $25,C00., The court re-,
grets.that he 'must hold that this is a be
quest for a charitable use, for it.woufd be
lairer to ' all that a portion of the expense
should come from others than the charita
ble societies. . *
-. Tne court does not allow that this lesracy
must abate proportionally with toe others, as
then the legacy would" fail altogether, a
$25,000 structure only being provided for. It
therefore should be regarded as preferred and
paid in full. Said he: "If I am eiror in
this it can easily be corrected on appeal." The
full sum of. $25,000 will be distributed to Bur.
gin Â£ McGlynn, in trust, to carry out this pro
vision of the will. â¢' ,
This leaves available for the other charities
9130,149 36:* The testator gives to St. Vin
cant's Orphanage of Marin County, $20,000;
Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum of San Fian
cisco, $20,000; Archbishop of San Francisco,
in trust, to be divided among the Roman Cath
olic charitable institutions of San Francisco,
$100,000; and also to each of the orphan asy
lums of Kan Francisco not heretofore named
$5000. Continuing the court says: -
There can be no doubt as to the validity of
the claim of first, the Maria Kip Ojrphanaee,
second, Pacific Hebrew Orphan Asylum,, and
third, San 'FrancWcd : Orphan Asylum. . Tne
fourth, the St. Joseph's Infant Asylum, ii also
allowed; so is the San Francisco Ladies' Pro
tective ana Keliel Society, 'Ihe Bishop Arrai
tage Church Orphanage 61" San Francisco, the .
Girls' Directory Orphan Asylum;. the ban Fran-.
Cisco -Nursery for Homeless Children, the St.
Francis Technical School,- the Boys' and Gins"
Aid Society and the Youths' Directory are shut
out, not having been, orphan asylums iv the
true sense at the time of the testator's death.
This gives us five institutions, each of which
is entitled to come in as an "orphan asylum of
San Francisco." To each of such Institutions |
is given $5000, making 25,000. Â»?*â¢â â ' â  I
. Thus we have $165,000 in general charitable,
legacies to provide for and only $130,149 36 [
to do it with. This would give to -each of the"
legatees $7887 81 on its legacy. Such per/
centage will be given the following named
charitable legatees, to wit: '. -.

' The other charitable legatees are all affected ,
by a stipulation by them with the widow that
for purposes of distribution two-thirds of all
the property of deceased should be regarded as '
community property. Under this the charities j
affected obtain only .652896 percent of their

THIRTY YEARS IN FOLSOM
Robber Caliendine of Sacramento
Is Now Known Only as
"No. 3886."
Still Smiling as Throughout His
. - ' Trial ' He ;â¢ . Enters the
Prison's Gates.
SACRAMENTO, \ Cal. , Aug. . I.â L. h.
Caliendine, the leader of -the ' gang that
robbed' the railway car barn six months
ago, was brought before : J ud.ee Hinkson at
â  10- o'clock this morning and sentenced to'
the State prison at Folsoco for a period of
thirty years. .-Before-" pronouncing aehj
tenet, Judge', Hlnkson administered a
severe -lecture to Caliendine, in which he â 
said: ' â¢'â¢... â¢
"I believe that when you presented your
gun at those me"a at the street-car barn on
, the \ night before :f Christmas : that' you
would v have taken their lives had -they
made, a show of resistance. ; I believe that,
young though you "are, your - liberty is "a
menace to the public, ; Throughout j these
whole proceedings * you have : : shown*,: no
.â inn of regret for what you have done, and
I believe that were you to f go free i to-mor- 'â 
row you would again enter upon a crimi- '
nal career." *Â â¢ "â 'â¢â¢â  ."
â  During the morning hours preceding j
nis -sentence the prisoner was very ill, and :
when be .; ; appeared 'in the , courtroom he ;
was pale and 'wan, bat he neypr for a v mo- I
men t lost .bis' air of utter, indifference; ana !
received his sentence with the cynical !
smile with which be -has observed the en
tire proceedings of the trial.
Sheriff .Johnson lost no time in hurrying
his ,:â¢ prisoner to >< Warden Anil's caravan- ;
sary, and although during the entire trip
Caliendine experienced returns of the sick
spells of the morning he remained defiant
to the last, and worVthe same old smile as
the huge iron doors -of the prison clanked
behind him. No." 3336, as ne will be known
in* the future, weighed 7 but 113 -pounds
when he bade farewell Jto the outside world
for a period which, with all :j possible*cred
its," will exceed eighteen ye,ars.

SAN DIEGO'S COMPLAINT
Citizens Demand the Rebuilding j
of a Temecula Canyon
Railway.
Land Given to Secure the Line Is
. â¢ Now- Held â¢by a Town-Site
Company.
SAN DIEG.O. Cal., Aug. I.â The Btate
â Board of jÃjaiiroad Commissioners began a
session here to-day to inopire into the
complaint of the Property-ownerts' Union
for the rebuilding of the Southern Cali
fornia Railroad Company's washed-out
line through Temecula Canyon, \o connect
San Diego with San Bernardino and the
"Atlantic and Pacific. Delegations ' from
Riverside. Fallbrook, Temecula and other
points were on hand to testify as to the
harm done by the. cessation of railroading
through the canyon.*
They declared that the bulk of the
trade of Southern Riverside and Northern
San Diego couniies now went to Loa An
geles and other towns, instead of to San'
Diego, while passenger traffic was greatly
impeded. The railroad company, on the
other hand, alleged that the line through
the canyon is impracticable-, and that it
has been washed out twice by floods. The
people of that section are served, it de
clared, by the present read via South
Riverside and Santa Ana. and it insisted
thpt rate? to and from Saa Dfego and
those points were the same as before.
During the afternoon .witnesses went
upon the stand'and brought out the real
grievance ofthis city aeainst tee Santa t*e
system. The principal witness, Warren
C. Kirn bail, toid the story. He testified
to having given 10,000 acres ot land, in
company w.tu his brother Frank, to se-
I cute the building of the line from San
i Diego to connect with the Atlantic and
j Pacific at Barstow.
He- said the men' who got the land
oreamzed the railroad company and par
iia.lv constructed it and then organized
the San Diego Land and Tyv\n Company
and transferred the land to it instead of
the railroad. The agreement was to
maintain repair-shops, roundhouses, etc,
at National City. After the railroad wÂ«b
buiit the shops were moved to San Ber
nardino, and when the Temecala Canyon
line was washed out the comnany refused
I to rebuild it, leaving San Diego in the
position of being a feeder to Los Angeles.
Tnere is nothing to show that the rail
-1 road company proper got the land subsidy,
I ,
! valued at $3,000,000. but the Land and |
> Town Company, "a wheel within a wheel," '
as Mr. Simbali put it, enjoyed the benefit
of the people's generosity. The stocthold- ,
ers of the Santa Fe and the Land and j
i Town Company were the same.
To these contentions the railroad com- j
i pany replied that it never received a djol- j
i lar frcra the city ot Ban Diejjo and Kir
n! ball Brother?, and that it was not respon- j
sible for what tht Land and Town Com- ]
pany did, or for the acts of the promotors
of either corn pany!
The case is being bitterly fought and
volumes of old records were produced to- ,
day. The commission adjourned until
Monday and it is probable that several
days will be consumed in the bearing.

I have been causing trouble by encroachine i
j on the Cascade forest reserve in the neigh- '

I for the arrest of sh'eepraen now pasturing

I tends taking summary measures.

RAIN FALL IN THE SURYR.

SEATTLE, WAPp.,"Aug. 1,-The rain

worth of timber has been consumed, be
sides the damage to other property. = The

CAPITALISTS OF
STOCKTON SUED,
Three of the City's Rich
Men Charged With
Fraud.
ACCUSED BY A PARTNER.
Declared to Have Conspired With
a Defaulter to Rob
Him.
HEAVY DAMAGES DEMANDED.
Papers in a Sensational Suit Filed
in the Superior
Court.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. Lâ L. A.Rich
ards, through his attorneys, James A.
Louttit of this city and Van R. Paterson
otSan Francisco, to-day riled in the Supe
rior Court a sensational suit against P. B.
Fraser, D. S. Kosenbaum and I>. A. Guern
sey, three of the most prominent men in
financial circles in tuis cjty. The suit al
leges all sorts of frauds and deception, and
it will without doubt bring about a hard
fouebt leg&l contest.
The complaint alleges that the plaintiff
and the three defendants entered into an
agreement in December, 1891, by which
they were to engage in the purchase of
farming lands in this county on a partner
ship basis. The transaction that caused
all tne trouble was the purchase of 3000
acres of land from J. F. Mosely, tue de
faulting County Recorder and Auditor t
â¢who is now sojourning in Europe on the
money that he took with htm from this
country and from Central America,
whither he went after he bad tired of the
pleasures of life in Stockton.
The complaint recites fie fact that none
of the property was conveyed at the time
to Richards, but that a half-interest was
conveyed to Rosenbaum, one-fourth to
Fraser and the remaining fourth to Guern
sey, and that the trio entered into a con
spiracy with Moseley, the County Re
corder, at the time. It declares that the
defendants "fraudulently designed and
schemed to entice said Richards" into the
partnership for the purpose of fleecing
him, and that all three "conspired with J.
F. Moseley to keep secret the actual agree
n>eut between the seller of tiie lands and
the purchasers as to the price paid."
This, he claims, was done for the purpose
of defrauding him, as the price paid did
not exceed $40 an acre, while the defend
ants represented to him that they paid $75
an acre for the land, and made him pay
lor his proportion of it at that rate. As
Moseley was the seller and also the County
Recorder, Richards claims there was no
difficulty in arranging to keep the actual
price secret.
Richards claims to have made two pay
ments of $6*250 and $8240, in cash, and to
have given Rosenbaum his note for $56,000
for the. balance of the purchase price. He
now wants heavy damages.

THE SANTA CRUZ ENCAMPMENT.
Delegates to the Christian Church Conven
t/on Conclude Their Labors and
Adjourn.
SANTA CRUZ. Cal., Aug. I.â The busi
ness sessions of tbe annual State meeting
of the* Christian cliurch of Northern Cali
fornia, which have been in progress for
two weeks in Garfield Park, closed to-day
at noon with the adjournment of the
church convention. To-morrow, the' clos
ing day of the meeting, Mill be observed
by religious services. ..* â¢ .
Ti'.is morning's session of the church
convention was opened, by Rev. James
Small of Oakland. The report of the
finance committee,,' recommending that
the Berkeley Seminary be kept up to, a
high standard as an 'educational institu
tion, was presented. The committee
urged that the endowment fund be in
creased as soon as possible to $100,000, with
the view of ultimately bringing it up to
$250,000.
A resolution was introduced asking the
convention to join with the Sabbath Ob
servance Association tn a petition to the
Legislature f^r a law demanded by that
association. This resolution created con
siderable discussion, as the Christian
church does not believe that there is a
Sabbath day, but that the Sabbath went
out by limitation, and thia church ob^
serves the Lord's day/or Sunday* under
Christ's dominion. It w,aiÂ» agreed to pe
tition the Legislature for Suudary as a rest
day, not as a- religious right, but as a mat- .
ter of protection against Sunday excur
sions and the like. But the .petition is to
be so framed that .employes shall not be
in danger of losing their positions through
observance' of the day.
This church believes that everyone may
worship according. to his ow-n will. '
The committee on obituaries expressed
condolence for the family of the late Rev.
James A. Logan, who died at Madera
since the present meeting was begun, and
for the families pf Dr. I. N. Hodsjen of
Woodland and others. The convention
then adjourned for ohe.year.
This afternoon a vacation was. taken.

HOGAN DEFEATS RAPP.
Wins in the Jenthi Round at the Santa
Monica Canyon Pavilion.'.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. I.â The
fight to a finish between Fred Bogan and
W, H. Rapp, feather-weights, came off ac
cording to programme last night in the
pavilion at Santa Monica Canyon. Both
men were in splendid condition, and the
fight was a hot one from start to finish.
There was a large crowd in attendance,
the greater portion of which went from,
Los Angeles, during tbe evening.
Bogan was the favorite from the start.
He showed great improvement in form
over two weeks ago, and justified the faith
of his backers by nuttim,- Rapp to sleep in
the tenth round. Fred Monahan officiated
as referee, and gave general satisfaction,
his decisions being fair and impartial,
while he enforced the rules.
Bogan is now looking for a match with
any man of bis weight in the country. He
is in condition and able- to make- a* satis
factory showing, so he believes, against all
comers. He will probably go to San Fran
cisco in a few days.

FRENNOCH UNLUCKY MONTR.
Thirteen Inquests Conducted by the
Corontr in July.
â¢FRESNO, Cal., Aug. I.â The number of
fatalities during the month of July was
unprecedented in Fresno's history. Coro
ner Long held thirteen inquests during
the month. In July, 1894, Coroner
Stephens had eleven cases, and this record
was ai the head of the list of Coroners'
reports until this year. It appears that
fatalities have always been more numer
ous during July than in other months.
The sawmills in the mountains and tbe
harvesting machines always supply their
regular quota during that month.
In bis report to the Board of Supervis
ors to-day, County Health Officer Adair
says^that almost all dairymen 'have re
formed their methods of carrying on busi
ness, and that as a result the city is sup
plied, with one or two exceptions, with
pure and unadulterated milled Dr. Adair
considers this a great improvement over
what has been the case. All dairies, with
the exception of that of J. B. Hill, who
was complained against a few days ago,
have cleaned up their premises and in
other ways made improvements conduc
ive to the health of consumers of milk.

McKINLEY CLANS
AT LOS ANGELES.
New Quarters of the Sixth J)is
trict League Opened to
Republicans-.
SPEECHES BY PARTY LEADERS.
Surrounding Towns Send Large Dele
, gationsâ Ex-Governor Markham
. Talks for Protection.
Los Angeles Office of Thk Call, )
328 South Broadway, \
Los Angeles, CaL., Aug. 1.)
Republicans of this section turned out
in large numbers to- nig lit to attend the
opening of the new quarters of the Young
Men's Republican League of the Sixth
Congressional District. The league- has
taken the former quarters of the Los An
geles Athletic Club on South Spring street,
and has ample room at its- disposal for
similar crowds which will gather in ttie
rooms during the campaign.
All of the speakers favored the gold
standard and were opposed to the free
coinage of silver as proposed by the oppo
sition. Republicans were urged to stand
loyal to the party and not to go after the
will-o'-the-wisp of Bryan. Mention of
McKinley brought forih loud applause.
In addition to members of the Superior
courts, various city and county officials
and other prominent Los Angeles Repub
licans, delegations were present from Pasa
dena, Pomona, Orange, Redlands, -San
Bernardino and the surrounding towns.
Previous to tho speaking, a general re
ception was held in the rooms of the club,
fruit being served to the guests. The re
ception committee consisted of W. O.
Dow, W. A. Blakely, F. P. Frost, I. P.
Harrison and A. Waldie. A. W. Kinney,
president of the league, called the meet
ing to order, and referred to the remark
able growth, recently, of the Republican
league in this country, and said that or
ganization was necessary.
Ex-Governor H. H. Markham was in
troduced and SDoke briefly. He said that
the people ought to stand on the Â«old
basis and support tbe Republican party.
The vital issue, however, was, he declared,
protection to American labor.
The Democratic party was the party of
promises, and now it had started out in
this campaign with a new one. It had
never iultilled any of the promises it bad
mane. The speaker said that he had al
ways been friendly to silver and had hoped
to see it some day used as an extensive cir
culating medium, but much as he wanted
silver he could not sacrifice those three
great Republican principles â protection,
reciprocity and internal improvemenis â
to it.
J. R. Newberry treated of the financial
issue princioally, and spoke from the
standpoint of a business niau. The com
mercial people were keenly alive, he de
clared, to the present situation and had
closely drawn the lines between the two
standards of money. The commercial
travelers represented the business men,
an aggregate of 150,000 persons. Of these
no- lebs tnau 98 per cent were in favor of
gold. This was certainly significant, he
declared, and showed the sentiment of the
commercial people. His was one of the
best speeches of the evening.
' L. G. Brown spoke of *the league and
made a few comparisons between the can
didates. There could be, he declared, no
hesitancy in choosing between William
McKinley, the champion of American
labor, and "Billy Boy" O'Bryan.
S. H. Haskell. an editor from Jfomona,
declared the present campaign to be one
of Individ ualjeffort.
Frank Gibson, the cashier of the First
National Bank, reviewed the financial
issue extensively. He presented a num
ber of strong reasons for'wantine the pres
ent gold standard, and in support of his
opposition to free coinage of silver pointed
to the miserable and impoverished condi
tion of the people in the countries where
a silver standard was in force.
R. N. Bulla, Assemblyman from this
district, followed, and declared that Bryan
had been elevated to his present position
simply on account of his having made an
eloquent speech. Mr. Bulla predicted
that there was not a man in the Repub
lican party who was now rdady to vote for
Bryan but would cast his ballot for Mc-
Kinley in November.
Judge B. N. Smith of the Snperior
Court closed the speech-making.
STOCKTON'S MAYOR OUSTED.
JET. X. Baggs' Beat in the Republican
County Committee Is Vacant.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 1. â Mayor
Bagcs is no longer a member of the Re
publican County Central Committee. No
sooner had the meeting of the committee
opened to-day than Committeeman Collins
introduced a resolution calling for B.aggs'
retirement from the committee and de
claring that the Republican party did not
want any members who thought as he
did. The resolution read as follows r
' Be if remembered that H. N. Baggs, a mem
ber of this committee, was, at the last City
election, eleoted on a so-called non-ptfrtisau
ticket to a position of public trust; that at the
said non-partisan convention H. H. Baggs pub
licly declared in substance "that he had left
the Republican party and that it had no col
lar on him," be being at that time a member
of this committee, aud that he had, since the
adjournment of the last meeting of this com
mittee, openly stated to Republicans and was
reported us well in the daily pre*g as haying
renbunced his faith and allegiance to the Re
publican party; therefore, be it
Resolved. That this committee finds thai H.
N. Jbagers is not the kind of a Republican that
the rank and file of our party desires retained
on this committee. Therefore, it is ordered
by the Republican County Committee that the
seat ot H. N. Baggs in the committee be de
clared vacant, and that the said H. K. Baggs
bo no longer recognized therein.
Bagsrs was on his feet in a minute, and
declared that tie would resign if not
wanted on thÂ« committee." The resolu
tion was then withdrawn and Baggs'
resignation was accepted.
Grove L. Johnson was indorsed by the
meeting, and the delegates to the Con
gressional Convention were instructed to
support him.
SAN BERNARDINO KATIEICATION
<* Jiryan and Watson " the Slogan of
JtemocratM and Vnpiillttn.
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., Aug. I.â
The Democratic- Populist- Bryan-Sewall-
Wataon aggregation turned out in num
bers at their ratification to-night. Clubs
were present from Riverside, Redlands,
Cohort and other contiguous points. An
almost total lack of enthusiasm was a
marked feature of the demonstration.
Populist leaders were the chief speakers.
Scores of prominent Democrats refused to
have anything to do with the affair. It
was noticed that "Bryan and Watson"
was the slogan, and not "Bryan and
Sewall."
Every day brings changes in this sec
tion, and nine-tentus of them are favor
able to Me Kin ley and Hobart. Protection
for the products ol tiie orchards is the
great demand of Southern California, and
the issue cannot be clouded by a ory for
peculiar and impracticable doctrines.

RENO, Nbv., August I.â Representative
Newlands, who arrived from the East this

address at the opera-house this evening.

ventions. He Â»aid people should lay by
all otlier interests and fight as one solid
body for silver, and ha hoped the people
of Nevada would unite on Presidential
electors.
GOLD DEMOCRATS CONFER.

â¢ \ COLUMBUS, Ohio, Aug. 1.-The confer

attended by about twenty-five prominent
members of the Democratic party Â»in this
Btate. Ex-State Senator Joe McMackin of

clared to be the sense of ; the meeting that
a State convention should r, be held here at

National Democratic Convention and that
an advisory committee be selected to ar
range for nominations for electors-at -large,
but that no State ticket be nominated.
SECRETARY MONTON'S SPEECH.
Declares There Wag .Vo Criminal lit
tuonetitation of Silver.
NEBRASKA CITY, Nebk.. Aug. I.â
Secretary J. Sterling Morton delivered a
speech here to-night. Tbe address was
confined entirely to the financial question
and contained no reference to Mr. Mor
ton's alleged candidacy for the Presiden.
tial nomination on a second Democratic
ticket.
Secretary Morton was greeted by a large
and representative audience. There were Â°
a large number of ladies in tha assem
blage. The meeting was entirety a non
partisan affair, prominent Democrats, Re
publicans and Prohibitionists being upon
tba stage. Secretary Morton was pre
sented to the audience toy Hon. John Mat
tis Jr. Morton was grateful to the citi
zens for the confidence expressed in ex
tending the invitation to speak on the
financial question. He entered intc a dis
cussion of the history and functions of
money.
He declared that there was no criminal
demonetization of silver in 18J3, but that
it was done after fn!l discussion. The is
sue of depreciated silver money caused the
boarding and taking by foreigner* of the
better gold money. This was the cause of
the panic of 1893. The creation of the
gold reserve of $100,000,000 declared the
purpose of the Government to maintain a
gold standard. If there was any con
spiracy in 1873 against silver there was a
crime againsc the natboat by the steam
boat and a crime against the steamboat by
tbe railroad, and agaimt the horse by the
trolley-car and bicycle.. People confound
tbe desire and demand lor more money.
There is no demand for money unless you
have something to give in exchange. All
desire money. The .silver dollar is not
mentioned in the act of 1873, but was de
monetized in 1853, and tbe law did not
harm nor hinder the circulation of silver
dollars among the people. There are
plenty of themâ enough tc pat eigbty-nva
in the hands of every man, woman and
child in the land.
There is no demand for tbo silver.
Ninety-seven per cent of the wholesale
business and 60 per cent of the retail busi
ness of the country is done without the
use of any coin. The mortgage indebted
ness of Nebraska is not nearly as large per
capita as that of New York. If this audi.
ence was given all the money in the uni
verse on condition that they hold it and
not use it they would be as poor as could
be.
If the silver men carry their point, all
who purchase of us will pay us in silver,
and all who sell to us will demand gold
and we will have to pay the premium. A
silver country is between the upper and
netner millstone*.
Tbe value of ail commodities is regu
lated by the law of supply ana demand,
and this is why silver is now cheap. The
United States can no more fix the value of
silver than Nebraska can fix the price of
corn. If the price of silver can be made
permanent so can, the price of all commod
ities be fixed by international agreement.
Value cannot be created by statute. A

McKENNA'S BIG CALENDAR
Over Two Hundred Cases Now
Before the United IStates Cir- J
cuit Court
The New Grand Jury Will A'so Con
veneâWill Investigate Mike
â¢ Cleary and L:nie Quongr
After a vacation of nearly one month the
several United States courts will resume
business to-morrow "(Monday). The Cir- |
cuit Court will be confronted with the
lareest calendar in many years.
The Government is interested in sev
enty-three civil and eight criminal cases,
in addition to these there are 103 general
civil suits, twenty-nine damurrers and ex- j
ceptions, while on the motion calendar j
there are eighteen entries. . Probably the
most important suit to be heard is that of
the Government against the Nort h Bloom
field Gravel Mining" Company. It practi
cally tests the constitutionality, of the
Caminetti act. So many constructions I
"have. Deen placed on the law aa it now {
stands that a definition of the act, oresum- !
ing it is declared constitutional, will inter- i
est thousands of people throughout Cali- i
fornia.
The new United States Grand Jnry will j
also convene to-morrow for the first time.
The session .promises to be full of inter
esting developments, as ther.e are an un
usual number of important matters to be
considered. It is stated on good authority !
that Dick Williams' friend, Louie Quong,
will be indieteu,.and also Mike Cleary, the
ex-customs inspector. The Grand Jury
will probably not Â«et down to business
before the 'a:ter part of the week, and the
matters referred to above will be the first
to receive its attention.
HIS TROUBLES INCREASING.
Fred Garcia Gets Six': Months and Will
'['.'i Be Charged With. Bigamy. â  -
Fred Garcia, ex-deputy marshal at Sau
salito, was yesterday sent to .the County
Jail for six months by Judge Campbell on
i the charge of cruelty to children. He was
arrested at Lafayette, Contra Cost a County,
Wednesday, on r a bench-warrant, as he
had failed to fulfill his promise to con
tribute $20"a month for the support of his
fire children by his first wife. â¢
Mrs. â¢ Garcia the first ; will swear to a
complaint to-morrow charging ; him with
bigamy. He eloped with Leta Isaacs, the
daughter of , â &'â  neighboring rancher, up
north about three years ago,- ana married
her in this City on October 29, 1894. : '
Garcia's attorney declares that his first
wife was not legally divorcod â¢ from her
husband, a Mr. Moore, when, he: married
her. He did not discover the fact till after
the marriage, and continued to live with
her till he met the girl Leta Isaacs. .

It is a creditors' sale, and it is to be con

Tramp steamers are running the wheat !

j dozens of ships are tied up in Mission Bay
j and over at Sausalito. Not one of them
j can secure a charter, and it will .probably
be next October before any of them leaves

Two of the tramps are loaded and ready
for sea, and four more are expected here

be here to supply their place. As soon as
the new crop comes in there w.ill be a

are that the charter rates will not be nigh.
R. S. Moore of the Risdon Iron Works
took a party ot his friends around the bay
in the launch Amy yesterday. The guest
of honor was Ralph Moore, C. E., of Glas
gow. He bas been inspecting tire mines
of Colorado, Nevada and California for
| English syndicates, and is now on â his way
home. His father is the Government In
. spector of mines for .Scotland, and from
him the son got his taste for engineering.
Ralph Moore Jr. is a cousin of R. S.
Moore of the Risdon Iron Works. The
i party visited all the points of interest
'in the bay, and quite a ti me was spent in
looking over the Oregon. Stops were
made at Oakland, Tiburon and Sausalito,
and the Preaidio army post was loosed
over.
Mr. Moore .is delighted with California
â  and says he would like to make his home
! here. The climate he considers perfec
tion, the flower!Â« most fragrant, the fruit
â¢ most luscious and the women â well, he
can find no words of praise with wnich to
describe them.
The prevailing opinion among practical
j men in Sa.n Francisco is that the Pacific
Mail steamer Colombia can be saved.
i They say tbat the hull can be raised,
' towed to San Francisco and repaired at
i small cost. Captain Burns, who over
i came all difficulties and with inadequate
| appliance raised the Blairmore, says that
| he will stake his reputation of sixteen
years that he can save the ship.
H. C. Tabrett, superintending engineer
of the Risdon Iron Wojks, says that if the
: Mail Company will give his firm the con
! tract he will raise the Colombia and Dring
her to San Francisco inside of two weeks,.
With the decided opinion of two. such
practical men before them it seems strange
that the Pacific Mail should abandon the
vessel.
News was receive i in a private letter to
day of the total loss of the British ship
Sierra Parima. Captain J. Wishart and
his entire crew were drowned. Oa her last
voyage to this coast four of the crew were
washed overboard while lashing the life
ooat and drowned. Now shio and all
hands have gone. Captain Wishart was
well known in San Francisco, and was
one t of the most popular skippers who
canfe here. The vessel was. on her way
! f.-ofi Mauritius to Rangoon in ballast.
| She went on a rocky island in the Uay of
I Bengal, and went down "with aril hands.
I In another letter written in Mauritius.
C;Â«ptain Wishart said: "I have enjoyed
good health so far, but this is a of a
place. Fever, smallpox all the time and
cholera cases daily. Alldiseases generally
fatal." The crew of the Parima escaped
all these ills only to meet death on the
rocks of a barren island.
Death of Frank Meeker.
Frank Meeker, a pioneer, died et the City
and County Hospital Friday from acute con
gestion of the lungs. The deceased was at one
time a prominent mill-owner in this City, hia
place ot business being on Bryant street, be
tween Fifth and Sixth. During the last few
years Meeker has lost the biggest part of his
fortune. Prior to being removed to the City

Preparations Being Made
for the Great Battle
on Monday.
WRITS OF RESTRAINT.
Three Will Be Asked for to
Block the Geary-Street Rail
road's Game.
NO LOOPHOLE TO B^ LEFT.
Shou d the Supervisors Grant the
Franchise Their Indictment Will
Be Demand. d.
More than usual interest will be taken
in the meeting of the Board of Supervisors
that will be held to-morrow. At that ses
sion will be decided whether the Geary
street Railroad is to be granted an exten
sion of its franchise for fifty years from
the present time.
Prominent property - owners of that
I thoroughfare and organizations of persons
interested in public improvements and
good government generally have com
bined to prevent the granting of such a
franchise, on the ground that it would be
a move against the public welfare and a
shameful and unjustifiable discrimination
in favor of the corporation named.
From a moral standpoint, it is argued
that to sell^a franchise now which is not
reaiiy necessary until seven years hence
would be simpiy to deprive the treasury j
of the municipality of the 'amount repre- :
sented by the increase in the value of such* j
a franchise between now and 1903, and to !
intrench the corporation interested 4or j
fifty years against all competition.
From a legal standpoint it is urged that '
the' board is offering something for sale !
that it does not possess. The franchise
for which bids have been advertised is i
now, and will remain under existing cir
cumstances, the property of the G-eary-"
street Railway for the next seven years.
Some of' those interested in defeating
the extension of the franchise hold that
any act of the Supervisors disposing of the
franchise at tQis time would be null and'
void, as it would be as ineffective as would
be the sale of the Lick: House by that body
or of any other property to which it did I
not possess title.
Others a. am, aware of the insidious
methods of the .Market-street Railway.
Company, of which the Geary-street Rail
way is a part, do not propose to allow that
corporation to secure even the.shadow of a
title to the franchise beyond the period
for which it is now held. And in order to i
prevent the proposed action of the Super
visors legal steps will be taken. >
Among tne latest reports relative to the
proposed acrion of the railroad people, in
order to 1 insure the final passage of the |
ord.er extending the franchise, is one to '
the effect that- an abandonment of the
present franchise wii! be filed, said aban
donment to be made contingent on the
acceptance of the railroad's bid for the
new franchise,' and 'the abandonment to I
go into effect just before the bid is ac
cepted.
Such a course is denounced as showing
s corrupt and collusive arrangement be- j
tw.een the corporation and the members of |
the board voting for the franchise.
Ex - Judge Van Reynegom does not i
think such proceedings would ?tand the
test before a court of equity. He claims'
that the board is now advertising to sell a
franchise which it does not possess and j
which sale would consequently be void; !
and that for -it to sell a franchise imme- I
diately after it obtains possession of it by j
abandonment would be a violation of the j
statute waich requires sach sale of a I
franchise to be advertised sixty days in i
advance of the actual sal*.
There was a meeting yesterday at the !
office of Attorney Leon Samuels of the !
committees and attorneys appointed by j
the various improvement clubs to defeat
the extension of the franchise.
After considerable discussion the matter
of looking after the people's .interest was j
left entirely in the hands of Attorney i
Samuels, who was authorized to employ
counsel to assist him. W. T. Baegett waa
suggested and he was promptly taken into
the tight.
Between now and Monday both gentle- |
men will be at work preparing for the
legal battle to oi>en to-morrow. in order
to take no chÂ«nce they will go before one
of the Superior Judges Monday morningâ
probably Judge SlacKâ and file affidavits
and make application for a writ of review
and a writ of prohibition. A complaint :
will also be filed and an injunction asked j
for upon it. It is hoped to make at least j
one of these three processes effective.
If all these fail, however, to checkmate
the game of the Geary-street road, a suit
in.eqnity will be instituted to set aside the
action of the board, and the Grand Jury
will be asked to indict the members who
vote lor the franchise on a charge of mis
demeanor and malfeasance -in office for
violating the statute relating to the grant
ing of franchises.
"One of the several grounds upon which
the franchise will be opposed," said At
torney Samueis last night, "is that the ad
vertisement asking for bids for it imposes
terms which are impossible of fulfillment
except to the Geary-street railroad. It re
quires that the work on the road for which
the franchise is to be granted shall begin
within a year and be completed within
three years. Now how could any other
company undertake to - comply with these
conditions, when the Geary-street com
pany holds a franchise which runs seven
years from date."
THE MAGUIRE CLUB
Its Permanent Organization Effected in
the Thirty-Fir*t District.
The James G. Maguire Club of the Thir
ty-first District held an enthusiastic meet
ing Friday night at Pnoenix Hall and ef
fected permanent organization.
Permanent officers were elected as fol
lows: President, Charles J. Gallagher;
vice-president, William MeLaughlin ; re-
Cording secretary, M. M. Katigan; corre
sponding secretary, C. J. Harridan; finan
cial secretary, William Lander; treasurer,
T. E. Treacy.
Congressman Jame3 G. Maguire ad
dressed the meeting at some length on the
issues of the campaign, and his address
was frequently interrupted by applause.
Speeches were made by Walter Gallagher,
T] Carl Spelling and others, and tne meet
ing adjourned to meet next Friday night
at the same time and place.
Attacked by the Cook.
H. Larape, a cook on the City of Papeete,
was before United States Commissioner Hea
cock yesterday charged with assaulting S.
Sugenoya, a Japanese seaman, employed on the
same vessel. From the evidence presented it
appears thp.r Lampe attacked the seaman wuh
a stone coffee-pot, inflicting severe injuries
about the head. Tne accused man was held to
answer before the United States District Court
to a charge of assault to murder. Sugenoya
was formerly employed on the Bear. He was
constantly on hand during the trial of Captain
Healy and waa expected to testify against tbat

A FUSION PLAN.
Franklin K. Lane -uggeatg a Why Oat of
Democratie-Popalistic Difficulties.
Franklin K. Lane yesterday suggested â 
the following as a fusion plan for Califor
nia, adaptable also to many other States.
He said :
The purpose ot Jhis plan is to secure the
full vote ot both the Democratic and Populist
parties for Mr. Bryan, while allowing to each
full opportunity to bring out the party j
strength for its Vice-Presidential nominee.
California having nine votes in the electoral |
college the State Committee of both parties !
should agree upon an electoral ticket com- )
posed of bo'.h Democrats an<i Populists. The
number of each on the ticket is of little conse- !
q&ence. As there were at the last election
about half as many Populist votes can as
Democratic the electoral ticket might be made ,
up of six Democrats and three Populists. But i
the number of each, as will be shown later, it j
of no importance.
This electoral ticket of Democrats and Popu- j
lists shall be voted for by both parties on the \
understanding tnat if the Populists cast more ;
.votes in the State than the Democrats the nine
electors, D^mocrais* and Populists, shall-vote i
Watson tor Vice-President. vfÂ» can judge the j
strength of the two' partie" by their vote on
some State office on which party line's are
drawn.
The only State official vbted for in Califor
nia at this election is the Lieutenant-Governor. j
Therefore let it be agreed' between the. State I
committees an/i theelectprs ;hat ii the Demo- !
cratic vote for Lieutenant-Governor js greater
t&aa the Populist vote for the same office the
nine electors shall vote for" Bryan and Sewnll, j
or i{ Populists outvote Democrnts that all nine
shall vote for Brjan and Watson.
SUFFRAGISTS WIDE AWAKE
Encoafaging Reports Sent In by
Workers in the Country
Towns.
Miss Hay Goes Into Raptures Over
the Fine New Headquarters"
in Santa Cruz.
A lively, interested crowd flowed in and
out of the Woman Suffrage Bureau all
yesterday, many of the visitors coming
from distant parts of the State.
"It's that way all the time," plaintively
observed Mise Mary E." Hay, chairman of
the Siate Central Committee. "Some
times !I really can't tel} whether I'm. on
my head or my heels. There are so many
questions to answer, and our visitors aie
so deeply Interested in our work, that a
reception committee of twenty would have
its bands full. Such a committee would,
to my mind, be a very good thing. â¢
"My trip to Santa Cruz was a revelation
to me. I cannot recollect any place oi the
size where positive affection for the cause
has been more noticeable and widespread.
On Friday. the new Woman Suffrage head
quarters were formally opened, a recep
tion or housewarming being given in
honor of the event." Tne offices are sim
ply beautiful, the auditorium and parlors
being elaborately finished in ivory-white
and gold.*
"The committee rooms and other an.art
raents are both airy and comfortable,
while in the matter of desks, chairs and
other furniture nothing could be desired.
Mayor Clark made the formal opening ad
dress, which was a brilliant oratorical
triumph. Mrs. Underwood McCann also
sp^ke, and Msss Anthony gave one of her
characteristic talks.* I was enjoying tÂ£e
affair to my heart's content when a lady
marched, me to the front and I had to talk
as well."
Mrs. E. G. Green is in chareÂ« of the or
ganization worK in Santa Cruz County,
and under her able management suffrage
clubs are forming in ail of the country
towns. The demand for literature is very
great.
Mrs. Laura G. Riddell, in a letter re
ceived yesterday from San Mateo, writes
in a very happy strain about her work in
that county. S cis visiting all the towns
and villages within the county beunda

them to secure possession of the road that
is now their missir.g link.
It lias been a matter of comment iq rail
ror.d circU-s that, while C. P. HufUingtqn
was -making the fight of his long and
eventful life for the passage of the funding
bill, provi/inp for the extension- of the
debt of the Central Pacific and Union
Pacific raiiroa>;s, the representatives of
the latter property appeared to be per
fectly willing to let the president of tbe
Southern Pacific Company bear the brunt
cf battle.' It is now pointed out that the
Yanderbilts, who are more largely inter
ested m the Union Pacific than any other
person, look little interest in the great
issue at Washington. This is explained
by their peculiar position in the railroad
world at the present time.
. Had the funding bill passed they would
have acquired the Union Pacific on easy
terms. Its defeat, however, was not a very
ditttitesfnl matter to them. It means that
tbe time is so much nearer when tbe Gov
ernment will have to foreclose on both the
Union Pacific and the Central Pacific, and
this is the opportunity that the Vundtr
bilts stand prepared to take advantage of.
While Huntinctou has bis financial re
sources and abilities now taxed to their
utmost to keep his vast properties out of
; eoeiverv hands the Yanderbilts have mil
lions "to bu r n." Should the Uoverpment
foreclose on its liens there will be seme
lively bidding, between Huntington and
Vanderbilt, with all the chances in favor
of the New York millionaire acquiring
both roads. .
At the time of tha visit of Cornelius
Vanderbilt and Chaurscey Depew to this
City a few months ago there were vague
rumors that their trip was for the purpose
of traveling, over ana inspecting the Cen
tral Pacific Railroad witn a view of ita
purchase in case of foreclosure, but such
reports were generally discredited by the
railroad magnates. With recent develop
ments, however, deep significance now at-
Uclrts to this sojourn of Vanderbili and
Depew. They traveled over the Central
Pacific on their return East and*, it is un
derstood, obtained most valuable informa
tion during their trip.
The loss of the Central Pacific would
mean to Huntington vastly more than tbe
mere" pecuniary damage he Wvuld presum
ably suffer directly. It would open his
Southern Pacific Railroadâ the pet of his
declining yearsâ to the assaults of the
most dangerous kind of competitor.
This competitor would be in a position
h to dictate to every transcontinental con
nection in the country. With a route giv
ing them tbe shortest possible all-rail haul
between the two oceans Huntington's
southern route would no longer be the
"mint" that it is now reputed to be.
* California would profit by the change to
an incalculable extent. It woujd, for the
first time in tbe history of the State, give
a genuine and independent competitor to
the Southern Pacific; Company for trans
continental business. It would further
take from San Francisco the handicap of
having the reputation of being a one-rail
road .City, and the stimulation to Eastern
and foreign investment that would follow
the State's emancipation from railroad
domination would be even more impor
tant than the immediate enjoyment of
lower rates and better transportation fa
cilities.
JOHNSON PLEADED GUILTY.
The Sailor, gaya He Doe* Not Care to
Be Tried.
Yesterday was arraignment day in Judge
Bahrs' court. Over fifty criminal cases
were on for arraignment and to be set for
trial.
Only two of the lot were of any par
ticular importance to the public at large.
Emma A. Ashley was called to plead to
the charge of* assault with a deadly
weapon, but failed \o answer. Judge
.Bahrs heeitated as to whether to issue a
bench warrant for ber ornot. As it was
the first calling of the case the accu.-ed
was given tbe benefit of the doubt that she
knew her case was to be called, and the
" matter went over to August 8.
Gus M. Johnson, the sailor who
shot at John Cane of the Ship-owners' As
sociation, pleaded guilty to assault to
murder. . Johnson is evidently crazy. He
laughed ana conducted himself generally
in an inÂ«ane manner during his arraign-
I ment. He will be sentenced next Satur-
I day.
B. M. Gopcheivich, the Servian editor
.accused of criminal libel, pleaded not
guilty. He will be tried August 8.
C. Edwards and W. Harris, charged
with assault with intent to rob, are evi
dently hard customers. Edwards has four
prior convictions against him and Harris
three. They will be tried August 14.
NEW LEAGUE ROAD BOOK
Will Be Out September I With
New Maps and Extensive
Information.
As stated in The Call yesterday the new
j handbook of the Nortn California Division,
i League of American Wheelmen, is just
out, and with it comes the gratifying in
formation that the new roadbook, about
I wnich so much has been said and written,
j will be ready for delivery by September 1.
This roadbook, will differ in many
points from former ones. The maps will
be much more accurate and complete,
though reduced to half their former size
arid printed on much thicker paper. There
will be one additional map, that of the'
district in^ which Fresno, Kings, Tulare
and Kern' counties are ' situated. The
j book will, contain complete lists of all I
! local consuls, league hotels and repairer?, j
and all the surveyed courses* of the Caii- 1
fornia Associated Cycling Clubs, including
I a map.and description of the famous 100
--j mile relay cdurse around the bay.
In former roadbooks the descriptions of
] routes have sometimes been misleading
| and cyclers or others following the book
I -would take wrong roads. Tfte new- book
i is so complete as to do away with any posÂ»
1 sfbility ot this.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1896.
THE POOLSELLER
IN SAUSALITO.
How the Exile Landed in
the Pretty Marin Hill
Town.
CAST UP FROM THE SEA
San Francisco Drove Him Out
and Oakland Received
Him Not
PATRONS FROM OVER THE BAY
A New Suit Against the Poolrooms
Began Yesterday â M arshal
Creed's Anger.
Pretty Sausalito, perched on and around
her green hill, is the resting-place of the
City man when the store/the shop and
the office close for the night. Worn with
struggle in the whirling, never-tranquil
mart of trade, he slips over the beautiful
bay, and in the cottage or villa among the
trees is as home.
But pretty Sausalito, where the green
hill comes down to tne blue waves, is the
toiling-placo of another manâ the pool
seller. When" tne merchant, the me
chanic, the lawyer, the artist ferry Â«>ver to
the City the pool-seller passes them on the
bay. In the evening the thing is reversed,
and so they come and go, crossing and re
crossing each other as regularly as the
tides of the sea.
A desideraium not to be wished in Sau
salito is the pool-seller. To the towns
people he is an alien from other shores,
and to the Town Trustees he is an inflic
tion on the body politic. He is a Poker
Flat outcast that will not be cast out. Bret
Harte could write charming tales of the
Sausalito pool-seller. With a little color
brushed in and a few dashing attributes
tin,ng gratuitously here and there, Killiji,
Scnwartzand Whitehead would be worthy
successors of the gallant Oakhurst of El
Dorado fiction:
So when San Francisco drove him out
and Oakland received him not the pool
seller landed with his blackboard and box
of chalk and a bundle of tickets on the
Maria beach.- The water trout stared and
the bill frow.ned on the exile. Both repu
diated him.
He was a self-welcomed "appearance, a j
self-inspired idea, a snlf-assumption.
Then Sausalito gathered herself together I
and the mills of the law began to grind. I
Between the upper and the nether stones
some of him was caught and conviction
followed. But the ; pool-seller liadestab-i
lished himself with his simple paranber
niilia ami defied the law. The second
trial, in which J. M. McGee was accused j
of selling City Marshal Creed a pool ticket, I
ended a few days ago In a jury disagree- j
meat, and the citizens;are wondering how j
it all happened. Juit^e Pryor's charge to ;
the twelve good men and true was strongly !
in the line of conviction. But they stood i
six to six, and the pool people scored their !
first inning.
The second trial of McGee was begun j
yesterday before Judge Pryor atiu the
"work.of securing a new jury commenced.
The prosechtion was conducted by City
AttorneJ A. Silvia and the defense by
Thomas P. Boyd of San Rafael. The pro
ceedings opened somewhat truculently,
both -counsel contending so strongly in
their respective choice of jurors that his;
llonjw threatened them with contempt
proceedings. .Even City Marshal Creed, i
the prosecuting witness and the inveterate
foa of the pool business, in nis enthusi
asm took a hand. . He caught a newspaper
artist sketching a picture of his Honor,
and .thinking lie was being handea down j
to- posterity in that manner arose in his;
wrath. '
He usurped the functions of the court
and ejeptessed his sincere intention of :
"breaking every bone" in the sketcher's j
bocly. When the court indignantly called j
him to order he continued his tirade until
the Judge threatened him -with a heavy
line for contempt. That and a view of
his Honor's judicial features in. the ob
jectionable s&etch quieted the angry ofii- I
cial.
At the close of the session of several
hours J. D. Folsom, John Richards and
N. P. Daruianaltinn were sworn in as
jurors. The court adjourned to next Tues
day evening.
In the meantime the poolroom of Wil
liam Harrison is miming at full blast at
the Buffalo House on the water front. It
is a cheerful place, the apartment opening
on the bay, whence Hie refreshing sea j
winds wander in through the wide door
way'to cool the heated brows of the
crowds that come regularly lrom tbe City
every morning. . It is the* principal land
ing place from the handsome yachts and
jaunty launches that lie moored just off
the poolroom. Gentlemen ard ladies in
natty aquatic togs come down to embark
aboard their vessels. â¢
As they troop by tbe door they get their
first impression of a- pool-seller a estab
lishment and the nondescript following
that woo fortune at tbe end -of a tele
graphic wire. The poolropm is a liberal
education to pretty Sausalito, perched on i

DELEGATES DENOUNCED,
The Six Populists Who Voted
for Sewall at St Louis
Reproved.
They Are Called Traitors While, the
Texans Are Congratulated for
Standing .on Principle.
The People's party County Central Com
mittee, at its meeting in Mozart Hall last
night, refused to approve of the action of
six members of the California delegation
who voted for Sewall for the nomination
for the Vice-Presidency. They were de
nounced as traitors to the party, while
the remainder, who *voted for Bryan and
Norton for the Presidency, were compli
mented.
The secretary read the following letter
which he had sent to the chairman of the
gallant Texan delegation, which had re
fused to vote for Democrat Bryan and
which had supported Norton and Watson,
both Populists:
Headquarters People's Pabtt "l
County Central Committee, I
Mozaet Hall, 1358 Market Street, f
San Francisco, July 29, 18i>6. J
To the Officers and Members of the Texas State
Central Committee of the People's Partyâ Gex-
ILeMen and Brothers: At a regular meeting
of the People's party County Central Commit
tee of San Francisco, held July 25, 1896, a
motion was unanimously adopted instructing
â the secretary to communicate to the People's
party of the State of Texas that we feel proud
of the privilege of calling you our friends
and brothers in the cause of human
ity; and when your noble delegation
at St. Louis held high the ban :
ncr of freedom in support of out
cardinal principles, our hearts were filled with
joy and the very fibers of our being were
thrilled with Â»n admiration that has crystal
lized itself into the determination that, if need
be, we will sacrifice our property, our homes
and our lives to maintain aud carry into ef
fective operation that immortal principle npon
which tlie People's party stands â of -equal
riehts to all and specUr"privileges to none.
We fully recognize that unless we hold the
beacon light of liberty rs the ideal of the
People's party, toward "which the great com
mon people can march to save our beioved
country from the greed of plutocracy and ab
solutism, we have no excuse to exist as a party.
Therefore, while we bow to the will of the
Sf. Louin convention and recognize the ex
pediency of their action in the present chaotic
condition of society, we know that then* .must
soon be a readjustment on a more precise, or
derly mid harmonious arrangement, whereby
the products of labor can be distributed with
out the intervention of monopolies.
There is where we stand, "square in the
middle of the road," right alongside of you
boys of Texas. And when the bugle calls -we
will unfurl to the breeze our benner, we will
till up tin- ranks with. both. young and old, we
will stand by you united for freedomâfree
dom's grand host against the evil of the world.-
We are very truly yours, The members of the
County Central Committee of the People's
party of San Franoisco.
K. S. Barney, Chairman.
Georoe D. Gillespie, Secretary.
R. E. Bush, chairman of the State Cen
tral committee, gent iv a communication
which Secretary George D. Gillespie pro
ceeded to read, but, which was objected to
by J. Asbury Johnson on the ground 1
that the secretary of the State Central
Committee had no authority to issue pro
nunciamentos. The objection was over
ruled by Chairman E. S. Barney.
-Mr. Bash's proclamation consisted of a
series of questions. Tee following are ex
tracts:
Mr. Bryan is reported to have said that he
will not discuss some of the issues in the Peo
ple's party platform of 189 U. What arc those
issues? If it is true that the .Democratic tiger
has swallowed the Populist .silver ideas, will
not the tiger be torn to pieces when the stiver
fulminate explodes by ttte idea of govern*
mental ownership and operation of public
nti.itlea?
If Sewall is run by the Democrats please sug
gest how to divide the electors with the Demo
crats and still keep their legal standing. The â 
People's party must poll one-third of the entire
volt -vf the State next November in order to be
able to make nominations by convention for
said offices. They must poll at least five per
cent Â©i the entire vote of the Stale for electors
for President and Vice-President in order to
have representation upon the election board
for the next four years. If Sewall Is run by
the Democrats, please suggest how to divide
the electors with the Democrats and still keep
o.ur legal standing. Will the silver men in
jour precinct vote for our nominees for Con
gress? Will they run Populist legislators on
their Silver ticket? Will such legislators sup
port Mr. Cator, or Mr. Lane the SHverite ?
J. A. Anthony, E. S. Barney, W. E.
Walker, Bnrnette G. Haskell and George
D. Gillespie were appointed a committee
to take charee of the ratification meeting
fixed for next month.
Colonel Taylor Ro gers and J. Asbury
Johnson related their experiences m the
Bt. Louis convention. They praised the
fairness with'which The Call had treated
the Populists and expressed dissatisfaction
with the Examiner for saying; that the
convention was composed of insane men
and fools.
In the coarse of Mr. Rodgers' remarks
Chairman Barney said/ apropos of th
rumored existence of a Democratic sack
in St. Louis: "Before Mr. de Young fet
contracts for the Midwinter Fair you had
to go up a certain flight of stairs and ccc
Mr. de Young and when you came out
it was all fixed and you were, satisfied."
The meeting adjourned after Mr. John
son had concluded his remarks.

Lily of the Amazon, the lotus, and also to
the park the "sweet magnolia blooms."
There are canopies over some of the most
tropical plants to prevent them being
chilled by the night dews.
This makes a pleasing contrast with the
green on every hand. A. D. Pryal, Com
missioner of Horticulture for Alameda
County, produced the park, "to give," as
he said, "the people a taste of what we
would hare if we had a large park in Oak
land. I have been advocating a large park
in Oakland for a quarter of a century."
He prevailed upon people to loan him
their most valuable plants, and there are
plants in the little park worth $100. The
plants are worth altogether about $3000.
THE PICTURE GALLERY.
It Is an Ornament to the Fair and
a Credit to Alameda
County Art.
The picture gallery stretches along one
large wall at one end of one of the halls of
exhibit. It is a welcome relief to the eye
after traveling over booths and miles of
manufactured and natural products. The
pictures run from pen drawings through
the gamut of art in oil, water color, pas
telles, landscapes, portraits, fruit, flowers,
bunting scenes and vesper studies,.one of
which is a scene in Alameda County by
moonlight.
A corps of workers was busy yesterday
afternoon hanging new pictures and
changine the arrangement wherever it
was thought it would add to the effect.

STORY TOLD UNDER OATH
Cornwall's Fac'.s Are Other
Than Those of Sapsr visor
Taylor.
JUEORS MAY CALL BATTLES.
He 1% Snpposed to Knew Something
About the Methods of the
Supervisors.
. â¢' ; William R, Summemayes. vice-president
â¢ and general manager of the Mutual Elec
; trie Light Company, is of the opinion that
P. B. Cornwall may be e ab!fc to :ell the |
Grand Jury something of decided' interest j
when he gets back from New Whatcom, (
' to which place Mr. Cornwall has ?one :
upon business. Mr. Summerhayes will
â¢ r.ot say that Mr. Cornwall knows anything j
â¢ about brokers for the Board of Supexvis- !
â¢ ors. go-betweens, middlemen or anything >
Âof that Â«ort. At the same time he will not j
' deny that Mr. Cornwall may have such j
knowledge and may be ready to impart it j
at the proper opportunity. ' \ :â 
[[ "Do you know of your own knowledge s
: .â¢anything aDout a broker for the Super- i
.. ' visors ; having approached. the Mutual |
.'Electric Light Company?' : " , :
.; . This question was put to Mr. Summer-. ;
'naves yesterday. - . 'â  . 'â ' â¢
' '".â¢'No,!' said Mr. Summerhayes after a I
; pause. - u Nd, I have rfolsach' knowledge." i
'â â¢'â¢ :. â 'Have you any indirect" knowledge of '
./ any approach made by a broker for the <
.Supervisors to your company?' .
. V.t. Sammerhayes- said" to this <l No," j
.'.but. in a. hesitating way, and intimated j
that it any such advance had been made ;
â the Grand jury would undoubtedly hear
â¢: all. about; that soon. But Mr. Summer
.. Layes was warm when he spoke of an in
'; sinuation contained in a mornjna paper
: .. that the Mutual Electric Light Company
'â¢ has. had smooth traveling recently because
it has propitiated the Supervisors in some
';' way, * * * .-â â ' "â  ' â¢ ' â¢â¢'
â¢ â¢'I 'â¢We have received no favors from the !
:.. Board ol Supervisors," he said hotly. "We
. -have been hampered and opposed by the
â 'Supervisors .md by the Street Department
â â 'â from' the Superintendent down. '-Any one
".â¢â is at liberty to probe into the affairs of the
.'â - Mutual Eleciric Light Company. It will
. be found that not one cent has ever been
expended by this company to secure
. privileges from the city. We have no fran
i chise. No, sir, not even the price of a i
. drink or oi a cigar been expended to I
â¢ influence one- SuperviÂ«er. I do not know ;
â¢â¢ what Mr. Cornwall can testify to before the :
' Grand Jury. When he testified before the ;
Grand Jury before it was not as president
of the Mutual Electric Light Company but
as president of the EdLson Company. The
.. Mutual Electric Light Company was
. not in existence at that time. You can
jadge how much the Supervisors fa
vor our company by recalling how
- the assessments of those companies with
. which we compete were reduced, while at
the same time our assessment was not re
duced- The assessment against the Edi
son Company was reduced from 5700,000
to $500,000. We were assessed $50,000 for a j
.* franchise which we do not possess. . It is a
â¢ fact, also, that the Edison Company has
, no franchise. That company succeeded
: . the California Electric Light Company,
â  but has no franchise."
â¢ : : "Yon . said yesterday that Mr. Mills,
.your solicitor, had made affidavit before a
notary concerning the treatment which
.. your company has met at the hands of the
Supervisors. Where is that affidavit?*,*'. ,
Mr. Summerbayes produced a transcript
; on appeal to the Supreme Court in the
: suit of tha Mutual Electric Light Cora
panv against Thomas Ashworth, Superin
. tendent of Streets, and also against the
â¢ City and County of San Francisco. This
V contains a copy of the affidavit of Robert I
â¢Mills, which was made before Notary G. T.
â ' Knox. Mr. Mills' affidavit is long. Amoae j
the sworn c statements in it are the follow
ing: 'â "-,]â ; \.' .; '.". + : "
Some time in the fall of 1895 the said com
pany (sintu,il Electric Light Company) was de
â¢ irons of putting up some electric posts and j
' lamp* on Ifowell street, in front of the Baldwin j
Hotel, at the request of the proprietor of said i
. hotel: that ?sid company made application to !
tat Board ol Supervisor* for an authorization I
s to do this, and Mr. Sammerhayes, -the vice
presieeat and manager of the company, was
duly informed by c the Street Committee. of said i
board, composed of three members, that there
cÂ«nld be no objection to the company .doing
this, anil the said board 3 collected c from the
manager ef tbe plaintiff, Mr. Summerhayes,
the sum of *1O to pay for 'advertising the reso
lution, as is the custom in like cases. c
'"" That before 0 a meeting of the Board of Sttoer
visors w*s held the, said Street Committee
changed its mind and ! rescinded the proposed
resolution and refused to g.?ant the' plaintiff
in this action the privilege of patting up the.
eleotric-light posts and lamps at the place*
above mentioned. 51 o ' Â
Â That this' affiant was thereupon instructed
a *toy Mr. Sammerhayes, the miinagar and rice- 1
â¢ preiident of the plaintiff s*& aforesaid, to go.
and see the de(ead,aat, Thpmas AshTorth, Su
perintendent "of Street, in relation thereto.
, That in pursuance of such instruciions \ this
*ffia!it visited" the office of said AsnVdrtb, in
" the new City Hall, to make inquiry why plain
iff was deprived of the right of putting up
Bnch electric-light posts and lamp?. *; 0 ..
Tb,at the said Ash worth replied that it was ''
Impossible for him to do anything in the mat- '
ter; that be acted according to bis tnltruc- '
tioni received from the Board of Supervisors; j
tnat pressure* Jiad been b/onght to s b^ar upon j
him and that the Edison Light and Power j
Company objected to plaintiff furnishing these j
light*; that th 3 Edison Light and Power Corf- i
t>any had a franchise and' that the pfaintfff :
had not and that, therefore, 4 thh plaintiff j
'could not expert tbe r SupervisorÂ« to give it the j
'" same privileges as they granted the Edison j
Light and I'oujer Company. a Â«
Further along in the same , affidavit is j
the following: . *: â¢ "
That tfiis affiant, nnnuant to instructions j
from Mr. Summ'ernayes, proceeded' and did
visit several, of th* Supervisors, especially |
Charles Dunker, E. C. Hughei and C E. Benja- j
rein; that this affiant talked to them and |
asked why these lampposts could not be* left I
s|anding: that the Baldwin Hotel people were
willing to furnish these light* free to the City, j
1 and could not understand why the plaintiff j
â¢hould be prevented from putting up the posts ,
and lights. Mr. Dnnker, Mr. Benjamin ; and (
Mr. Hughes each said that they could not ;do [
anything about it; that the matter had come j
up before the board, and i the Edison people
had brought such power to bear by claiming j
j that the plaintiff bad no right to put up posts
{.that they (the .; Board of Supervisor?) "could do
. nothing. Mr. Hughes also told this affiant
! that after Mr. Summerhayes had made appli
i cation on behalf of the plaintiff for a permit,
i that the Edison Light and Power Company
j people had brought influence to bear, cansios
: the Street Committee to rescind the privilege.
* This afaant then went to see Mr. Hughes and
! presented to him a 'letter addressed to the
1 Bo&rd of Supervisors from the Baldwin Hotel
! people, requesting that "de plaintiff be per- |
| mitted to allow the posts -to -remain; this i
j affiant stated that -Baldwin Hotel people
were willing to furbish the lights free of charge
to the City, and that it was an important
j matter to allow the lights to remain, and as
â¢ | the place belonged to the Baldwin Hotel
; pedple and the street was a dark one. are
! seemed to be no reason why they should not
remain there. Mr. Hughes said to this affiant:
â¢ "If, the posts belong to the Baldwin * people
we will sea what can be done, but the Mutual
: Electric Light Company it trying to insist
; upon patting up these posts sod they have no
! right to do so. The-EdUon* Light and Power

Luke Battles, wbp may . be. called as a
' I witness before the* Grand . jury, is '. t he ad
! juster of the Edison Electric Light and
i Power Company: Mr. Battles said at his
I home on Ninth" avenue last evening that
no suboena nad yet. been served upon him
!to appear "before the grand jurors. The
j Edison. Electric Light, and Power Com-.
I pany has not had much business before
| the 1 Board of Supervisors lately. The as
sessment which was '.originally placed
against the Edison Company he consid
. ered to have been ; out of all reason, and
I said thai there was no doubt but that it
I ought to have been lowered.
I Mr. Battles said that he supposed that
â¢ 1 Mr. Cornwall had been summoned as a
1 witness by tbe 'Grand Jury because the
1 jurora. remembered that he had been be*
j fore another Grand Jury under similar
! conditions and the present grand jurors
'â  probably think that Mr. Cornwall knows
as much about the Board of Supervisors
j in relation to electric-light corporations as ;
! any one does. "I, am very sure," said {
; Mr. Battles, "that Mr. Cornwall â¢ will tell |
l only what is right." â¢ .- '.-.
Mr. Battles has no ' knowledge, he said, â¢
I why Mr. Cornwall has been subpenaftd.
j Mr.. Battles had read with much interest j
j the exclusive interview in The Call with
! Vice-President Summerhayes of be Mv-
I tual Electric Light Company, in which
Mr. Staminerhayes speaks about the Board
; â  of Supervisors % but he did not care to say
. anything in reference to Mr. Summer
| hayes : ramarks. Mr. Battles, in addition
! to being adjuster for the Edison Electric
-1 Light and Power "Company, is president of
! the Point Lobos Improvement Club. He
j is well known At the new City Hall, being
I a frequent visitor. ' ; *- ' '
When the .Grand Jury has learned all
j that Mr. Cornwall knows about the Board
of Supervisors and the business of .electric"
| lighting companies with the board clews,
may be develeped which will point in sev- j
era! directions. The interest in the Grand |
Jury proceedings is more marked-day by.
day in tne City Hail and news "is- eagerly
, ! sought in several quarters.
. Tne natural supposition is that Mr. Corn
wall is wanted by the Grand Jury- to testify
, to something connected with street light
] ' ing. A rumor was about yesterday that
. j the Grand Jury will -call Lnke Battles, '
[ who. is connected with the Edison Light j
, and Power Company, to ascertain what he '<â 
I knows about the methods of Supervisors.

\ i Finance Committee of the Board of Super

that- Mr. Cornwall: may hare facts to im- "
part to the jury. / , .-.'â¢.
"What can he tell the jurors?" ;' ' â 
â¢'I don't know." ' . . â¢'
'Do you think that. he has hold of the
same set of, facts that you know?" 'â¢ -
'. "Xo,/' said Colonel Taylor decidedly. ?
'. . . 'Some facts are beginning to appear.'*
j "Yes," said Colonel Taylor* "and there
t are certain facts that can be put tpzether. ,
_ ! Among these are t c lowering of assess
. ments by which the Supervisors looked
out for their pets, the attempt to ignore
. ' the Finance Committee of the board as the
; Committee cm Water and Water Supply
â  was ignored when the water rates were
! fixed, the method cf letting the street
iiahting contract and on."
"Was the Committee on Water and .
Water cupoly ignored in making water
rates?" ; " - â â  " '
"\es, the committee never held a meet- â 
ing to â  fix those rates. The Supervisors,
took the matter out of the committee's
hands and did the : work in committee of
the whole." , ' â  \":; !7 . *â¢ -
The Committee of the Supervisors on
â¢ Water and Water Supply consists of Su
pervisors Morgenstern, Dimond, Taylor,
Benjamin and Hobbs. Of these only two
are members of the "Solid Seven,", namely,
Morgenstern and Benjamin, who were
therefore a minority in the committee at ;
the time the Supervisors went pver.theif
i heads and took the matter up in commit
! tee of the whole. This division of the
j Committee on Water and Water Supply
' may "have possessed no significance in

James Ryan Intended to Commit Sui

James F. Ryan, a cook by occupation,
â owes bis life to the fact that he is accus
tomed to carry a keen-edÂ«ed dirk con
cealed in one of his pockets. He was
hurrying along Sansome street yesterday
aiternoqn, and his peculiar actions at
tracted the attention of Officer J. H. Cob.i.
As Ryan passed the officer his doafcflew
open iri front, and Colin spied the knife.
Ryan was promptly arrested .and charged
with carrying a concealed weapon at the
California-street station. '
"That knife, which caused "my arrest,
prevented me from committinjf suicide,"
said Ryan last evening. "I have been out
of wot* for several weeks past and was
despondent. I made up my mind to com
mit suicide and was on my way to the
water front for the purpose "of drowning
myself when I was arrested."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1896.
ITS MINARETS TO
KISS THE SKY.
Magnificent Temple Spirit
ualists Intend to
Erect. .
ITS STYLE LATE GOTHIC.
President Barrett Will Be Here
Wfien the Foundation
â  Is Begun.
SOME COSTLY FTJBNISHIKGS,
A Testimonial for Elizabeth Slcper.
State Organizer, Who Selected
tLe Design.' ' "
At last th* hope of-, the Spiritualists of
California is to be realized'â they are going
to erect a beautiful temple ia the Heart of
San Francisco, which will not pnly attract
the ey-e of the public to their religion, its, â 
aims and purposes, but will tend to work
an internal change, to centralize them and
thus develop harmony and teal. '
I For years this desire loir a grand- reftg
j io'us structure has been Cherished* by ail
I believers of the spiritualistic cult In th 3
State, but untU recently the lack of uaity*
in the working of the numerous societies
has prevented any decisive steps . being
j taken toward? the attainment of the Nir
vana of their hopes. 'â¢ ' .
Now all "is changed. President â¢ Har
rison 1). Barrett, the head of the National
Spiritualistic Assoaiation, came to. the
Golden State with the expressed determi
nation of unifying the scattered forges.'
His spirit, aa.it were, moved upon the
surface of the ..troubled factions,' chaos
vanished, and the- result was that all the
different bodies united to form the Cali
fornia State Spiritualistic Association,
which w-asr duly incorporated under .the
' laws of tbe State. â¢
With this unirlcatlon came also the ma
: terialization of. their cherished plans, and
! so the- near future will witness the break
ing of "the scil for the foundation of the .
j temple. â 
j The site is a lot 50x100 feet near the
, intersection of Gough and Oak streets
and is the donation of a local believer.
The sty^e of the structure will be late
i Gothic. Tiie material used will be Roman j
j pressed brick of a cream color, with terra- j
I cotta trimmings. It will possess an un
i commonly well-designed facade, pictur
| esque in the extreme, rich in detail and
thoroughly dignified.
Three crown ins gables over it will unite
in one harmonious conception, tbe whole
elevation being finished by a central tewer.
At each end or the facade massive but
tresses wiil furnish s satisfactory inclos
ing liqe, and give an air of strength and
solidity to the building without detracting
anything from the general artistic effect.
Ail the glass windows will be stained and
figured. Tiie tower will contain a targe ]
electric clock, ana the upper part a chime j.
of bells. The clock and be. ls will als3 be a
| gift. .
The front supports will te figured iron
! columns. Upon the second floor will be the
auditorium, yrvch roorh3 for a library and â 
a children's lyceum. On. lower floor j
wiU be a banquet- room and apartments
I for a ladies', aid -society.
This auditorium will be furnished in
oak. In it will be:a magnificent organ, the
gift of a weaitby lady of thi3 City.
Tbe library, will be "free, arid the hun
dreds of -volumes possessed by Jocil so
cieties will be placed (here. To this library
will be added cho the best worksof general
literature, and especially, those of liberal
itts of whatever sex or belief.
Orw room ,wUl be-set apart for seances,
and will be constructed on the plan of the
one in the Banner of Light building, in
Boston. Hare seance* will be held weekly.
The Spiritualistic Ladies' Aid Society* ia
thoroughly organized and. will use their
apartments in the temp : le for the sewing
of garments and preparation of articles for
the sictc aud needy. â â¢ â¢ ;
Exclusive erf furnishings the' building
w.iU perhaps- cost about $100,000..; It wiil
cos; thousands ef dollars for the necessary
j equipment. AIT the money necessary for
the temple and â¢ furnishing will be sub
scribed by wealthy believers all over Cali
fornia. . 'â¢ Â*'**."
. -It is believed that the income from
property now owned by the various soci
eties wiil more than pay current expenses
after construction. ..* ;
The design of tJie building was selected
from the Scientitic American by 'Mm.
Elizabeth Sloper, the Btate organizer, and
was . adopted . unanimously "npon being
f submitted to the proper authorities. '
A ie3timoniarto <his popular lady is to
be giv&a to-morrow. evening at Friendship !

cieties, and there it- is .believed an agree

ill" 1 COOK, LATELY RETOENBD FROM EUROPE
" â¢ â¢' A Distinguished American Specialist, a credit to the Medical
Profession. He was educated abroad and has been a close-student
of hospital methods in Germany,- France and Austria. ' He has
permanently located in San Francisco. \, â¢â¢ *'
A recent arrival in San Francisce and a I
distinguished addition to the rants of the ;
medical professioa is Dr. H. .Cook, an j
American who has earned honor for -him- j
self t abroad and built up a reputation and
high standing iv his chosen- profession.
Years ago, recognizing the value of the
most modern and most thorough methods
in the treatment of human ills, and appre-
ciating thfi fact tfiat a wider and better
established field for tbe study of such con-
ditions'could be met. with in Europe than
in this country, he early in bis professional
career became one of the colony of enthu-
siastic Americans who sought to learn
many things" that â¢were denied them in
their own land.
Always a thorough student, Dr. Cook's
enthusiasm led him to mace a study of
the best methods of the more prominent
and successful hospitals that are. found in
Germany, trance and Austria. His re-
searches and determination to learn all
tfcuit could bÂ« learned, pursued under par-
ticularly favorable circumstances, opened
to him opportunities for improving his
medical Â»kiU that have been accordea to
few American physicians, and this thor-
ough coarse of scientific and intellectual
discipline has fitted him more thoroughly
for treating the maladies whigU he makes
request Supervisor Ho&bs to file a minority j
report requesiin},' an appropriation of
$200,000 for the Mission Hteh School. The
following were appointed on tiie commit
tee: Dr. John A. Miller, A. P. Van Duzer,
D. Keily, Thomas Cosgrove. William Wal
lace, J. G. Levensalef, John D. Daly,
Charles W. Maowaring, John Bolger and '
Judge A. W. Thompson.
Judge A. W. Thompson, on behalf of i
free silver, betran tbe discussion of the !
evening with a historical review of the
poM standard from its inauguration in
1816 to the present time. Dr. John A.
Miller followed with a critical, exposition
of the. financial question, and evoked
applause. When Dr. Miller had .finis.hed,
J. C. Heenan responded briefly in behalf
of the single gold standard.
At the conclusion of Mr. Heenan's
speech a vote oi ihants was unanimously
tendered the speakers of the evening,
after which the meeting adjourned.

A Challenge to Swimmers. i
â¢ Charles Cavil I, the Australian champion
swimmer who arrived here recently, has made |
his headquarters, at the Lurline Baths, Bash i
and Larkin streets. . He issued a challenge last
evening to all swimmers for a match from 500
yards up to fifteen miles. -and said he would b<Â»

A-McKrtiley and Hobart Republican Club
vras organized at San Lorenzi last evening.
Neill McConeghy was, elected president and
Henry Smyth secretary. Thrrty-foar charter
members signed the roll, a number of roualnu
speeches were made, and the greatest'enthusi
asm, prevailed. *
a specially of than any other physician in
the United States to-day. " â¢
' Dr. Cook is first of all a specialist, and
will strictly confine his practice to dis-
eases and ailments that . will properly
come under ttiat definition, and, uo4ike
many ijnbcrupuioas practitioners, his
practice will not include the- treating
of all ailments, although .perfectly able to
do so; bat his lifeworfc is tiie treatment
and cure of all sexual diseases of men and
women, and of all diseases, in their vari-
ous and complicated forms, that arise
from or criminate In a disordered sexoal
system.- He has investigated further into
the mysterious secrets of such ailments
than any other practitioner alive, and is
recognized throughout the East- and
Europe as tne greatest living authority on
diseases of which he mases a specialty.
Dr. Cook has decided to locate in this
City and has selected and furnished
'handsome offices in a central loca-
tionâ B6s Market streetâ aud from now
on wilt bÂ« found there daily, doing
his best to alleviate the sufferings
of all whose afflictions come within
the scope oi nis practice. Very sensibiy.
and rigbtlv, too, ihe doctor has deter-
mined that every patient who calls at his
office will receive his personal attention,
and under no circumstances be intrusted
to Incompetent assistants, well meaaing,
perhaps, but none the less dangerous.

THE LUMBER INDUSTRY BLIGHTED BY FREE-TRADE AND CANADIAN PAUPER LABOR
Having shown how the wool industries
Of the United States have been 'prostrated
by the Bryan- Wilson bi.il. the free-trade
policy formulated by Wilson and cham
pioned t>y "tha boy orator of the Platte,"
it is now proposed to show, in a series of
articles, how the lumber business of Amer
ica has suffered under free trade, how for
eign pauper labor depresses prices, and
now the, policy ably championed by Mc-
Kinley afforded ample proteotion to the
largest business in Americat
It should be fully understood aÂ£ the out
set that the lumber business of the United
States stands in magnitude ahead of all
other -pursuits. Wljat is meant -by this?
First, that its invested capital is larger
than that invested in any other pursuit.
Then/next to this, its product or annual
output is the largest, it employs more
people'and has more establishments than
any other in the form of mills and fac
tories.
It will be admittfl by every lover of bfs
country that a business of first magnitude
ougfct to have protection against any
thing that threatens td annihilate- it or
tends to reduce the profit accruing there
from to a sum so low that American labor
ers are reduced to the verge of penury.
It is a notorious fact tha,t on the Pacific
Coast the milling and lumber men are in
â¢ bad way. In Mendocino and Humboldt
counties there are thousands of men who
know nothing about any occupation but I
lumbering. .
"Men have grown old in our service,"*
said the oldest Mendocino lumber-dealer
living yesterday, "and we run our mills in
ordeF to give them work. We are not
earning a dollar, but we cannot make pau
pers of men who have served us until
they are gray. I started ii* the lumber
business in, 1852, and I cannot afford to
close my milla and turn my faithful. men
out on the world even if I am not making
money. Our only hope is In a protective
tariff that will afford us some defense
apaiiist the pauper labor and unequal con
ditions of British Columbia."
The following item from Iron and Wood
of San Francisco for this month, issued
yesterday, shows the condition of the
lumber trade. As the editor is a free
trade Democrat the most bitter partisan
cannot say the quotation is biased. Here
is a picture of the most important busi- j
ness of the Union under the policy of free |
trade, championed by Bryan : j
The lumber trade for the past month has
been in a worse condition thnn H has "been in
for years. Sales hÃve been light, and the re
ceipt? show a fallins off from July of last year
of $14,009,847. Of this amount the Pu?et
Sound mills fall from 25,770.448 feet in July,
1^95, to 17,190,861 feet in 1896; Mendocino
falls from 8,602,610 to 4,315,595, Humboldt
from 4,803,529 10 3.570,854 in the same time.
Del Korte increases its shipments a trifle.
Lumber freights to Australia are steady, but
the demand is light, while there is no demand
for China and West Coast. The outlook is
gloomy. The redwood mills have not as yet
shut down, and the owners seem in doubt as
to what course to pursue. Prices remain un-

changed, for the demand is so light that in
quiries are scarce and quotations are not asked
for. The Scotia mill will start up this month,
and if the output is placed on the market it
'win only add to the stock on hand. Altogether
the outlook is far from encouraging.
1 What isTespousible for such a conflition
of affairs? Free trade, as seen in the
present Wilson bill, the same un-American
law that destroyed the wool business and
pleased the English manufacturers ol
shoddy. Lest. the reader, think this is a
mere epithet the law responsible for the
destruction of thfr lumber trade is sub
is ilted i.n sections'. The following twelve
sections of the Wilson^ bill put wood on
the free list without qualification:

673. Firewood, handle bolts, stave bolts,

planking, not 'specially provided for in this

674. Timber, Be wn and sawed, and timber
used for spars and in building wharves.

676. Sawed boards, plaqks, deals, and. other '
lumber, rough or dressed,. except boards;
plank, deals and other lumber of cedar, lig

But there are people Who say that Amer

lus see. In 1893 foreign lumber valued at

American prices and staid the arm of
American labor; :*."â¢.
The following statistics of the "Treasury
Department for the periods named show
how the removal of the tariff on Canadian .
lumoer has affected the business ol the
American lumbermen. It appears from
that report tbat for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1895, the total import of sawed
lumber from Canada amounted to 539,

greater th-an for the entire previous fiscal
year..
During the same period the imports of
logs and round timber were 204,603,000 feet,
showing that the -Canadian product is
coming into the United States for the cur
ent fisca 1 year at a rate that will send the
total over i,000,000,000 feet before the close
of it. Think of- it! A billion feet of
Canadian lumber, logs and timber coming
into this country while dimension stuff
sells on the Chicago, market at $3 a thou
sand, and. for millirms of. feet of coarse
lumber now piled in Wisconsin and Min
nesota, the owners would be glad to realise
$6 a thousand at the mill.
The quantity of log's and round timber
imported from Canada for the first nine
months of the current fiscal year exceeds
by over 50,000,000 feet the. total import oi
the previous fiscal year.
The Northwestern Lumberman says j A
tariff of $ 1 a 1000 would probably keep
500,000,000 feet of this product out of the
American market. The influence of that
300,000,000 feet would be "felt by every
.manufacturer from Maine to Oregon, and
from -Minnesota to the Gtrlf ot Mexico. â¢

General Appraisers .thai tongued and

however, more than 20.Q00.000 feet of Cana
dian lumber had reached the coast mar
ket-, greatly to the demo"raliza.tionof busi
ness, i
'. Tne matter was then carried to the
United States Circuit Court of Vermont,
and Judge Wheeler holds' that' "the pres
ent tariff law provides for entry, free of
duty, of- anything which comes -under the
general head of lumber..,' The, terms
of "the- law itself are -somewhat
vague, and' in considering the ques
tion raised in this case, the Board of Gen
eral Appraisers decided, that the term
â¢dressed lumber' meant only such lurh
ber as had been surfaced on one or two
sides; that whÂ£n further wprked to adapt
the. stock for a particular use it'Decame
a manufacture of wood in the meaning of
the law, and as such was subject to an ad
valorem duty of 25 per cent." This view of
the case was upheld by twenty-four wit
nesses out of the forty-six-heard.
When the decision of the Board of Gen
eral Appraisers above referred to was
made lumbermen in the States bordering
on Canada were just beginning to feel the
effects of Canadian competition on a free
lumber basis, but in that decision saw
some prospect of relief. Such prospect is
now dissipated, however, by ,the decision
of Judge Wheeler.
It . is not generally understood why
Canadian lumber and the products of
Canadian- manufacture can be imported
into this country under free trade in such
a way as to paralyze American industry.
It is for several potent reasons. At the
outset, the Canadian lumberman has
crown, lands at low rentals, with no in
vestment ot capital, no taxes and no in
terest running against him. Then, again,
the British Columbian lumbermen hire
Chinese and Japanese at from 60 to 70
cents a day, the laborers boarding them
selves.
What can the American workmen ex;
pect to do against such competition? In
this aspect of the case it is not strange
that the Wilson bill, a mild form of what
Bryan would like to inflict upon the coun
try, has caused universal business stagna.
tion.
E. M. Herrick, president of the Pacific
Coast Pine Lumber Company, who has
given the lumber question great study, is
unquestionably in favor of a protective
tariff. Speaking of the general subject of
protection as it affects lumber. Mr. Her
ripk yesterday gave the following unan
swerable arguments and tacts in favor of
the ideas of protection and" prosperity, fle
said:
'â¢'There are some phases of the question
by which the trade on th,is coast is differ
ently affected than other sections. â 
"There are not' now, and cannot De for
geoerations to come, the slightest grounds
for apprehending scarcity of timber, and
consequently no justification whatsoever
for considering the question of reciprocity,
commercial, union or any other lorm of
interchange of products between this coast
and our northern' neighbors. British Co
lumbia has nothing to send to us except
lumber and coal, both ofwhich we have in,
un-limited quantities and the development
of which has interested large amounts of
capital to such extent that the greatest of
competition has been engendered on our
own side, and in this respect the con
sumer is protected to the greatest possible
extent; and, as a fact, the consumer has
for the past year been buying, and is now
buying, lumber at less than the cost of
production,
"Considering the limited markets acces
sible to the lumber manufacturer on this
coast, and the very large number of mills
seeking the same, there is no possibility of
such markets reaching the capacity of
present mill plants for a number of years,
except always an Eastern shipment trade
by rail can be developed. There being no
question as to the supply of lumber, no
question as to the price at which the con
sumer gets it and no opposite conditions
possible to exist for many years, it is im
possible to understand how a Government,
djeenied paternal, can in any way give our
limited markets to our northern neigh
bors, when the effect will be inevitably the
wiping out of the present' invested interests
on the American side.
"There is also another very material
reason, appealing to a certain extent to
National pride, that should prevent any j
action under which British Columbia
mills can seek the markets of this coast.
I refer to the question of ship-building, an
industry that has been, comparatively
speaking, dormant -for some years and'
having its principal, if riot only, activity
on this coast. The fostering of this in
dustry is of more than local importance;
inasmuch as the character of vessels most
recently built are carrying our flag to
ports where it has been almost unknown,
and additionally to the stimulation of this
pride is the increased use of pur lumber
â  in the construction of said vessels, as well
as the advertisement of its possibilities in
ship-building use, "created by the advent of
magnificent models of American 'ship-*
building in foreign ports. ,
"If-by reduction of duty or any form of
reciprocity, British Columbia has the
'entree.t o our markets, a death blow to "'
this industry will be struck at once. Vic
toria, the principal port of. British-Columb
ia, lies but forty tailes distant from Port
Townsend, the clearing port of Pnget
"Found, and excepting such distance is as
near to- American ports of consumption on !
this coast as Pnget Sound.' The right to i
â¢ export lumber to any American port from !
British Columbia would carry with it the j
right to ship same in foreign bottoms, and
the lumber markets thus supplied from j
British Columbia by fdreign ton n age J
would practically permit foreign vessels
to engage in the coasting trade. The same
conditions, to wit, lower cost of construc
tion, less wages in manning vessels, etc.,
that have ruined American deep-water
shipping, would thus become an entering'
wedge in similarly affecting the snipping
of the coast.
"Further, should the American mill
owner, under any improbable future con
ditions, be able to continue his business at:
as low a cost as is possible in British Co
lumbia (through governmental assistance
in the matter of Jow rentals of crown
lands, etc.) he would, in the matter of
shipping his product coastwise be handi
capped by the obligation to employ only
American vessels, while- his British
Columbia competitors have the choice of
all flags. - -
"It would .appear, therefore, evident that
on this coast at least (and loj>ine that sim
ilar conditions may exist on the extreme
Eastern Atlantic coast, where Maine man
ufacturers would be brought into|corhpeti- â¢
tion with those of tÃe provinces), -the
opening of American markets .to British- 1
j Columbia mills means destruction to both,
j American mill interests, already depresse4
to the lowest limit by crverprpduction, and*
the growing shipbuilding, industry on this
coast. .' ." . .
â "Well understanding, the usual method
of our foreign competitors, even the
handling of this- business would be in
their hands: Offices representing Eng
lish mills would be established in Sab
Francisco ana-other coast chics, supplied
by foreign clerks.and wi.th- the manufac
ture, freighting! handling and distribution
in' the hands of .our competitors the only
American connection, with.- the trade
would be the payment-of the bill,' and it
does not see.m -possible, therefore, that
-from those who'by their investments have
added to the taxable wealth of the country j
and thus contributed Jargely. to the reve- !
nues by which the State- and /Nation are i
â  supported should be taken the only trade
they have and ; the same- handed over to
non-citizens who would .not pay one dime i
,to the support of either.
."It goes without saying tha.t tbe whole I
lumber interests on the Pacific Coast are J
â  heart and" soul in favor of American mar- 1
I .kets, for ' American lumber. ..The Pacific,
I Coast manufacturers are ready to take an
j active. part and will fight as vigorously in
the accomplishment of this .protection,,
1 and they trust as successfully, as in their
! special campaign against the 'mills' legis
lation 1 of 1888, and on the receipt 01 ad
vice of'any movement of Eastern manu
facturers in the protection of American
lumber th;s Coast will be heard from wif>
no uncertain sound."

favorite training ground, after a short stay
in Colorado, prepared to inform the sport
.in Â» fraternity of the East .that the. people
of Cal.ifornja grow wise and good as 'they
.grow old, and that he has forgfven them
for the cold "reception 'they tendered to
him w"hen he first visited ''Frisco 'after his
victory lover the ereat Boston inn pugilist.
Corbett and his- brothers and immediate
friends were having a final talk yesterday
â¢ aflertioon in Harry Cof.bett's saloon, when
a tej^gram from Billy Woods, the ' big
Denver pugilist -who' whipped Jack Davis
in this City and was afterward whipped
â¢by Jcfe Choynsfciin a long-drawn-out tlgb.t
a-t the Pacific Club, was h"anded to him by
;a messenger.
Wn,en the champicm opened the dis
patch, his face brightened up, and turning
to his brother he said with a smile: "Say
Harry, jUst listen- 1Â© this ; it is from Woods
'.of Denver. v
â¢ "Well, let us hear it,'' answered Harry,
and James spouted as follows: "Wjll you
meet me in a limited-rouna contest in
Cripple Creek? Yqu to receive.6o per oent
â¢of the gate receipts. A big house Â«ure."
â  Jim studi-ecl the proposition and in his
open and above-board" way said tu*at he
had better take the snap, that money was
money and that Cripple CreeK "dough"
was just as good as he could get any
where, even though' it be of,, the white
metah .
Harry Corbett and his nearest friends
advised Jim to accept the offer and Cor
bettlost no time in answering Woods that
lie would start Saturday evening for the
fite iri Colorado vi;here the proposed con
test will be pulled off..
â¢ The champion had everything arranged
and pVanned to go to Asbury Park, his
old training station, but instead of depart
ing for New York, Corbett with his' wife
and the little clever pugilist, Dal Haw
kins, left last evening on the 6 o'clock train
for the creek in question. The champion
was escorted across the bay by several
members of the Olympic Club. His father
ani brothers were among .the many warm
friends of Corbett who sarv him on board
the cars and "wished him bon voyage and
good success. "
Corbeit i-ntends to -go straight to his
training quarters in Asbury Park after his
bout with Woods. He says that he will
positively get a good match for Hawkins, j
and that he willalso be on the lookout for j
a match between Jeffries and some of the '
big Eastern scrappers who are looking for i
money and glory. Jeffries will remain
quiet in this City until he hears from Cor
bett, and it is doubtful if "he will consent j
to a meeting with any pugilist until then.
The Divorce Court.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted a divorce j
to Ruby McGulre from William McGuire.be
cause of the latter's willful neglect.

Emil Markeburc, an aeronaut at me Chutes,
and Chris Johnston, one of the tiCEet-takers
engaged in an altercation last night over some
money claimed by Johnston for an ascent
which he made some time ago. Johnston

epithet to him, whereupon he struck the aeron.
aut upon the head wlui a heavy cave, Inflict
ing a scalp wound. Markeburg's head was
dressed by Dr. Bunn?ll at the Receiving Hos.

with assault with a deadly weapon.

MANHOOD!
' The Most Precious Ele-
ment of Our Physical
Being. You Do Not
: Know How to Appreci-
ate It.
When a man is broken
down in his vital powers as
a rule he is not the only one
who suffers. Others, family,
friends;, those who enjoy his ;
company and protection, no-
tice the depression in his
spirits, thela'ck of ambition,
dogged disposition, nagging,
irritable temperament. It
makes all who come in con-
tact with him unhappy.'
Let the reader understand
that all this misery comes
from the loss of nerve force-
that element which is the
well spring of- all joy, of all
mental and physical pleas-
ure. It is the loss of this
nerve force that leaves the
mind and body weak, and
causes the sufferer to feel
that the best of his life has
been spent.
To replace the force and
strength of .the nerves we
must, use Electricity â not
.drugs â as Electricity â  forms
the basis of all animal life.
It is the nerve force, the life
of the nerves, and the life of
all -nervous and vital organs
increases when Electricity is
applied in mild, soothing
currents, as it is from Dr.
Sanden's Electric Belt.
â¢It is hard to convince some
people of the value of this
great Electric Belt, for every
sufferer knows too well the
great amount of fraud and
deception which is practiced
by makers of a cheap grade
of belts, and how these char-
latans impose them on the
public with the announce-
merit that they are "as good"
as Dr. Sauden's.
"I have read about other electric belts," gays
a correspondent, "which claim to be as good as
yours, but they don't show, as many cures as
yours does." -'''"' : : ' 'â 
"I have tried many different remedies and
several other makes of electric belts, -but re-
ceived no. benefit until I used yours. It has
â caused a permanent cure;" l Bays James sH.
Burden, 417, Clementina street, Stockton, Cal.
Dr. Sanden's Electric Belt
will : positively cure all weak-
ness arising from early
habits or later excesses. If
you are weak you owe it to
yourself, to your family and
friends and those who â¢ will
look to you for a heritage of
health, to cure yourself now.

SMALL LOT, BUT BIG FEE.
Peculiar Suit Filed Because of a Mis-
sion Real Estate Deal.
A peculiar muddie, to elucidate which
will require the services of a Superior
Court and several attorneys, has resulted
from the efforts of several people to be
come possessed of a little Mission lot, the
entire frontage of which is about three
feet.
The diminutive piece of real estate is
situated on Bartlett street, forty feet from
Twenty-second. It has a frontage of 38
inches and a depth of 125 ieet. Daniel
Lambert owns it, but C. D. Bianchi and
others want it. So anxious ha 3 Bianchi
been to possess the strip that some time
ago he made a contract with Lambert to
purchase it from him at the rate of $75 per
front foot, provided Lambert's title was
clear. Lambert was, however, to Day the
expenses of establishing the title.
A few days ago Bianchi offered Lambert
$87 50 and a receipted bill for expenses in
tracing the title in lieu of his lot. Lam
bert refused the offer, and in consequence
suit has been brought by Bianchi to com
pel him to accept the money and give a
deed to the property.
At $75 per front foot Lambert's real
estate is worth $237 50. He is offered
$87 50 and the receipted attorney's bill for
it. Therefore the b'iil for tracing the title
of the $237 50 lot must be $150.
She Cut a Hone.
Annie Kane, alias Mary Rowe, was sent to
the County Jail lor six months by Judge Con
lan yesterday for cruelty to animals. Annie
was released from the City and County Hospi
tal about a month ago and celebrated the
event by getting drunk. She attacked an
Italian fruit-peddler with a knife, but he es
caped. She then turned her wrath upon his
horse and cut the animal on the flank.
Kicked His Father.
â  James McCarthy, an officer appoin tea for the
Tenth Precinct of the Thirty-third District,
was sent to the County Jail for six months by
Judge Conlan, yesterday, for battery upon his
father. McCarthy Jr. went home under the in
fluence of drink, and on his father remon
strating he struck him on the nose and kicked
him.
WISH TO ABOLISH
THE FREE LUNCH.
Saloon Men Will Take
Action in Regard to
the Matter.
SUPERVISORS MAY ACT.
The Attorney of the Association
Is Looking Up Their
Powers.
ORGANIZER GARLAND SPEAKS.
Says the Abolition of the Lunch Will
Result in Better Liquor
Being Served. â¢
Saloon men in this City, as well as in
other parts of the State, are almost unani
mously in favor of abolishing the free
lunch institution that has become bo im
portant an adjunct to every bar. The
California State Protective Association,
which represents liauor makers and
dealers from all over the State, has taken
a stand against the lunch and efforts will
soon be made to have it legally abolished.
The California State Protective Associa
tion, which is the fountain-head of all
branch organizations of liquor men, con
sists of three classesâ class A, which in-
eludes wholesalers, brewers, rectifiers, dis
tillers and wine-growers of. the City;
class B, which includes the wholesalers
and brewers of the interior, and class C,
including the saloon - men. Branches are
organized in all but four counties of the
State. The purposes of the association'
are to protect the interests of the menii
bers, and only liquor men of the better
element are admitted. The officers of the
association are:
President, J. P. Edoff; vice-president, E. R.
Lllienthal; treasurer, William Alfs; secretary,
Winfield Scott: attorneys, George W. Baker,
John W. Mitchell (Los Angeles); board ot trus
teesâJ. P. Edoff,. William Alfs, hH. Mundy,
Fred Staude, Joseph' M. Loewe, C. F. A. Last
(Los Angeles), E. R. Lilienthal, Thomas Kirk
patrick, Rudolph Taussig, Harry M. Campe,
John Wolf.
J. B. Garland, the traveling organizer of
the association and president of the local
branch formed in this City on Friday last,
when asked to state his opinion in regard
to the abolition of the lunch said :
"Saloon-keepers all over the State are
only too anxious to abolish the lunch. As
organizer of the State Protective Associa
tion I have come int- contact with dealers
all over the Stale within the last- two
years and have found saloon-keepers to be
generally in favor oi abolishing the lunch. â¢
"A number of liquor men were ip favor
of abolishing it by Legislative enactment,
as has been done in New York, where the
law has just been tested and decided to be
constitutional. A large, number of local
saloon men,- however, are in favor of hav
ing an ordinance passed by the Supervis
ors abolishing the lunch. Georgje W.
Baker is at present looking up the lega.l
powers of the Supervisors in such a mat
ter, and when be makes his report some
action will probably be taken.
"The present movement originated with
branch 2, which was recently organized in
this City. Although some are. kicking,*
the abolition: of the lunch would have a
good effect. Many saloon men are com-
I pel led now to furnish Inferior liquors in
consequence of the elaborate lunches they
have to keep. If the runch were done away
with better liquors would be furnished.
Some of the cooks are also objecting, but
if the lunch is discontinued'they will sim
ply be removed from the saloons to the
restaurants.
"The California State Protective Associ-,
ation, which has this matter in hand, is
composed of the better element ol liquor
men all over the State, and has done more
within the past few years than the Prohi
bitionists have accomplished in the last
half century. They have closed up many
disreputable establishments and liave
worked to keep the objectionable element
out of the liquor business.
"The association is not organized for
political purposes, but merely to protect
the rights of liquor men. They propose to
rid the business of- a certain objectionable
element, which the Prohibitionists cannot
do. The present movement on the part
of the association is a good one, and I hope
that it will go through all right."
ANENT THE NEW CHARTER
Reply of the Municipal Reform-
League to J. Richard' . ,
Freud* .
Some Interesting ' Facts Quoted Re*
ganting Municipal Government
in Eurcp*.
Recently the Municipal Reform League
addressed a letter to tbe citizens, in which
it detailed some of the prin cipal objections
to the new charter. To thii J. RiÂ«hard
Freud, secretary of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, responded in an address delivered
before the Association of Improvenfenf
Clubs. The Municipal Reform .League in
turn repiies as follows:
To the Citizens of San Francisco: An issue
of fact has arisen between J. Richard Freud
and the Municipal Reform League respecting
the bearing of Professor Albert Shaw's works,
"Municipal Government in Great Britain" and
"Municipal Government on the Continent of
Europe, on thequestions-at issue' in. this pro
posed new charter. Mr. Freud, in his address
July 15, said: "It is claimed by those who
have superficially read Albert â¢ Shaw's
works * * * that the idea of selecting a
Mayor instead of a Council at the head of *a
city government is erroneous and should not
be done in the case of San Francisco."
We below make extensive quotations from
Professor Shaw's books and will leave tne citi
zens of San Francisco to decide who has "suÂ»
perficially" read the works of Professor Shaw.
In our previous address we said :
"In the cities of Europe the people are con
stantly securing increased influence in the
management 01 their affairs. T,he principle of
large governing bodies, elected by and resnon
sible to the people, is receiving more and more
support in tho great cities of the civilized
world. London has a governing tody of 140
members, Manchester of 104, Glasgow 78, Paris'
80, Lyons 56, Vienna 138 aud Budapest 400
These are true representative bodies, and are
acknowledged successes. They give good gov
ernment, and give it cheaply.' r It was in reply
to the ebove that Mr. Freud alleged superficial
reading, and he said: "This conclusion is not
based on a thorough study of Albert Shajw nor
any other prominent writer on municipal gov
ernment."
Albert Shaw himself in the preface of his
work, pHge7, says: "I have no intention to
prescribe European remedies for American
maiadies, -nor to suggest any degree whatso
ever ol imitation. We must deal with our
own prob.ems in our own, way." It is tnere
fore clear tha; Albert ShÂ«w would not recom
mend Jhe adoption of a system ot government
that our fori-fathers had abandoned.
We have notea the words of Mr. Freua and
the Municipal Reform League in order the is
sue may be clear.
To the above quotation, made by Mr. Freud,
we object, because: First.it is only a partial
quotation, and the sentences immediately be
fore and after it when read -in connection .
therewith completely.change its effect. Tuiti
ine to page 6 of the preface we read as follows:
*â â¢ â¢â¢The primary difficulty in the way of a gen
eral study of American municipal government
lies in the lack: of logical principles and the
capricious and arbitrary nature of the legi sla . .
tive changes that one State .or another is ' CQ _.
stantly making. lam strongly impressed with
the belief that municipal /reform proceeds
naltinglv in the United States because, tor one
reason many citizens : who desire sincerely to â¢
aid in the regeneration of their town life a.nd..
neighborhood affairs have formed j no-definite .
municipal ideals. They have neither learned
what in the experience of . the world has com e 
to be regarded a3 a sound constitution or frame- â¢
work of municipal government, ' nor ha.ye
they madeuptheirin-Lnds towhatpositiw easel
and public services :a- municipal government,;
may wisely apply itself. I have no intention.
to prescribe European remedies for American
maladies, nor to suggest any degree of imita
tion We must deal with our own problems in
our own way. But (and this is important), we
must be willing to gain all possible enlighten
meat from the experience ot others who have ,
been dealing with kindred problems, and have" .'
found solutions that are satisfactory under/.
their own circumstances." Why did not Mr..
F i e t U wi}l UO be observed that Mr. Shaw say_ that
the primary difficulty? lies in a lack .of any
logical sVstem. That, we contend, is the prim
ary difficulty with the proposed new "Charter.
It has no definite ! system. If is too long. It is
a jumble. It is -uncertain in its provisions and
usually Inexpedient In its policy where it has â 
any. .It contains bidden jokers. - - â¢â â¢
Mr. Shaw says, as above quoted, that Anjeri- â¢
cans have not learned what in .the experjenco
of the world has come to be regarded as a
sound constitution or framework of municipal
government If an example of this truth were
needed the new charter of San Francisco would
Certainly supply it. " , ; , '-,' *.'Â«
In 'the second place, we object that Mr.
Freud's quotation .was totally Immaterial and*
irrelevant, because Mr. Shaw was writing' to
inform and not to reform the American public,
ana, therefore, there was no necessity of his _
attempting ,to apply European remedies Jo
American maladies. Americans simply want â 
to know what other people are doing. They .
have enough intelligence, when" correctly in-'
formed, to act for themselves. We must, how
ever, as Mr. Shaw says, be willing to gain . all
possible enlightenment from the experience of.
others who* have' been dealing with kindfed
problems. , . . .'â  ...*..
Jn thfe third place, Mr. Shaw was not allud
ing in -the- paragraph. quoted to the form* of .
government, but. to jvo'rk that governments
should do, for he unqualifiedly condemns the
principle of having a dictatorial Mayor, and .
praises large governing bodies ot coTuncilmen. â 
Before we take up that partof oujr subject let'
us consider Me. Freud's statement: â  "It. is
therefore clear that Albert Shaw himself would *
not recommend the" adoption of a system of
government that our' forefathers had aban
doned." Our forefathers did not abandon the
system now in vogue in 'Eurepe .* It was not
until 1832 that the first parliamentary reform
bill was enacted in. Great Britain, and it was
not till 1835 that mu*nicipal reform took place-
there. ."â¢ â¢*'-â¢;â¢
Our forefathers made' one kof the "greatest
achievements in governmental science, out
their sons have rested lazily on the .fathers'
laurels, while capitalistic innovators have sub
verted to their own .ends what our forefathers
'achieved for -us. The new charter is an ex-,
ample ot the subtle tactics of the corporations."
The cities of Europe, as Mr. Shaw repeatedly
tells us, are from fifteen to twenty j'ears ahead
of us-iirthe science of managing their muni
cipal affairs, and â  it "will be- well for us" if we
wake up and learn what they Rnve to reach In
the science of municipal gQvernment. .Tn'ey
displavcd wisdom and judgment by borrowing
a system of government of their neighboring
cities.' - * .'â â â¢â¢ * * * * â 
On this subject Shaw says '(page 2) : "The
manner in which the principal nations.
Europe have of late dealt 'with, these new
problems of community life, under conditions
of dense inhabitancy, is highiy instructive. l^
The problems, to be solved "are so similar to*
those .in our country] in all Jheir essential
characteristics, regardless* of national dis
tinction, that they Â«.fÂ£ord an important field? of
comparative study both descriptive and criti
cal." At page 18 he says : "We. cannot wisely,
continue to ig-uore the lessons .that European
cities . have to teach. ! The present costliness
of ttnilr past negligence might well stimulate'
us greater precautions. â¢ * â¢â¢ The art'' of
.ranking Â and administering modern cities'
happens not to have engaged the attention of
the same order of^alent in America that it ha*/
commanded in Europe." â¢ .â  â¢- -â¢. â  â¢" :
Page 19 ' we find the foljQwing: "Al general
familiarity with their attempts and achieve-
ments might save American cities from some'
mistakes, and might stimulate them .to aaopt ,
Dreader* and more g*enefous, # municipal pro
grammes." He gives in his two ' works exten- '
sive accounts of the . municipal systems' of
<?reat Britain and the Continent of Europe/de
scribing separately the systems of twenty* or
more cities. In* Gneat . Britain . the Mayor is
elected by the Town "Council, presideÂ»at Coun
cil meetings, but has no veto and.no au
thority as an appointing officer. The legisla- ,
tive and executive power rests in the Council,
which acts through committees. . (Page* 31
and 32.) ' . â¢ â¢ 'ÂÂ»'Â»,
One of the most pertinent paragraphs lnÂ»tb*a
whole York on the mun.cipaf government Qf
Great Britain appears on plages 62 and S3. . iji
speaking of the American system di a responsi
ble autocratic Mdyor he says: Â« -'. ! -<'â ".. -' â 
.''ln the dispersion of authority [between _He
Council and Mayor.] definite responsibility*
too easily disappears. The May&r's veto upon
ordinances passed by the Council divides *re
sponsibility for the by-laws.' .*.*â¢ * -The em- '
barrassments growing out of this, divided re-,
sponsibiiity are among the principal causes of
the comparative failure of 'city government in
the United States. 1 ; , â¢ . *
:i~ Continuing, he 'says of the proposition td
make {,he Mayor* a municipal dictator, as. is,'
proposed in the new cflartSr of â  this "city :
"Many, earnest and intelligent reformers, es
pecially in New. "York and the â¢Eastern -States,
nave* advocated the plan of increasing ;he
authority of the Mayor, so that he may.be held
more definitely: responsible for fhe adminis
tration of the various executive* departments.
It is the plan of a periodically " elected
dictatorship. A.", a remedy for the 'evils'
that grow out of the interference .by
â¢the State and the farming out of'
certain departmerrts^-such as parks or water,
supplyâ to special boards" or ''commissions not
responsible to the Mayor or the Qouncil or "the
â¢people and further as a 'defense against" un
trustworthy and corrupt councils, . this
pi an of making thÂ£ Mayor a dictator, or to use '
the Cromwellian euphemism, 'a protector,'
seems to have a great deal In Its favor. But it
is unretmblican and it does npt at all solve,
the difficult problem of harmonizing the
authority of the Mayor and. the authority* of
.the Council.. The relation between the -ttvo
cannot at best be other than'tnat of.a shifting,
unprofitable and â  illogical compromise. -It
would . : seem aâ â¢ little strange that this
sthool of reformers should . not' . haVe
been earlier opposed by another which would,
advocate the concentration of authority and
responsibility in, the .Council, logically the
Mayor mu,st eventually swallow the Council,
or the-Council must swallow the Mayor if. t'ha
politicaf forces are*t& be allowed some degree..
of natural'play; and the one-man powei*ison
the .decline everywhere in th*is age. Munici
pal governments, elsewhere than in the United*
States,' after having constituted a* ail
ing body do not erect a separate one
man power and give it. the means to
obstruct the ruling adminstratlve'bodyand to
diminish, its scope, and responsibility.' The
Mayor elsewhere .is an integral part of the
Council."; English; Scotch and Irish municipal
government is simply government by a group
of men who are to be regarded as a grand-com
mittee of , the corporation consisting of ..the
whole body of burpesses or, qualified citizens.
In Glasgow It is a committee of 78; in Edin-'
burgh of 41 ; in Manchester of 104 ; in Birming
ham of 72: in Liverpool of 64;' in Dublin 'of
60 ; i,n Belfast of 40, and in* the other incor
porated towns of the United Kingdom it varies
from 12 to 64, according to' them size. So far
a*s these bodies have authority to pass laws at
all, their -authority is complete, and 'nobody
obtrudes a 9 veto, a?hey appoint and remove all
officials. They - have entire charge of the.
municipal administration, distributing, the
.work of department management and super*
-1 vision to standing committees as they'please.
I If such a local "government cannot be trusted
: the fault ;-â  is with â  popular institutions.*
llt iis â  quite â >' certain to be 'as . good â 
as- ; the : people,* 'concerned deserve to
have. ; s The ! location of responsibility is
perfectly definfte. When the Glasgow city
improvement fcneme'became unpopular with
voters because it was proving more ex
pensive than its projectors ha/i promised the
chairman of the committee was retired by
his constituents at the end of. his term. The
taxpayers hold every member of Council
responsible â  - for -his â  â  votes. The system
is as simple, . logical and effective
as the " American system. is complicated
and incompatible with, harmonious 1 and
responsible V administration.. City govern
ment :in America defeats its own ends by its
checks and balances, its partitions of duty and â 
responsibility and its grand opportunities for'
the game o! hide and seek* Infinitely supe-*
rior is the English s;s:em, by Which the peoolc 0
give the entire managenien t of their affairs" to
a big committee of their own number, which
they renew from time to time." .

retfcry .of c *tne league, says that no such
proposition has come before the executive,
committee.* He says it is tbe feeling of the
members of that committee that the efforts
of tbe league ought, for the present, to be
concentrated upon making city ownership
of the elect ric-ligbt plant a success; that
now that the city has won in the injunc
tion suit, the utmost endeavor ought to
be put forth to run the enlarged plant
economically and effectively, so that the
stand taken by the citizens against private
corporate ownership may prove to be a
wise one; that tbe committee. feels it to be
the best policy to drive one nail at a time,
and to drive that home, before striking an
other. Notwithstanding this feeling, how
ever; he says that if tbe corporation which
is generally believed to be back of tbe
effort .to harass the city shall continue to
set its dogs upon the city, it is not impos
sible that'tbe citizens may be goaded into
retaliation aÂ»d may put in a gas plant to
be owned by the city and run in the inter

NOTT MAY COACH
BERKELEY'S TEAM,
Probable Selection of the
Big Ex-Captain of
Brown.
WILL ARRIVE TUESDAY.
Comes to Assist Professor Set
chell in the Botany De
partment.
WEtL KNOWN AMONG ATHLETES
Did preat Work in the Football
. Games. With Yale and Harvard
Last Year.
BERKELEY, Cal., Aug. I.â Charles P.
Nott, who comes to Berkeley as assistant
to Professor Setchell in tbe botany depart
ment of the State University, and who
CharleS' P. N*oti> Brown '96, Captain of the Brown University Football Team
for the Season, of '05-96, Who Will Conic to the University of California
Next Tuesday as an Assistant m Botany, and Who Will Probably be BerKe
ley's Football Coach for the Season of '96-97.
will probably b.e the football coach for the
coining season, is .expected to arrive here
on Tuesday next. 'The -announcement of
.'his coming Is greeted with delight by foot
ball enthusiasts of the college town,
. Nott is a' graduate of the class of '96 of
Brown" University, whoÂ«e football team he
captained last season. In the games with
Yale and Harvard Captain Nott did great
work, his playing constituting a feature
of the contests. While He has not yet been
selected as coach for the coming season,
the indications seem to be that be will be
chosen. Professor Setcbell believes Nott
to be an excellent player, and it in known
that several of the athletic committee of
the university lavor him.
Ordinarily the election of the coach is
kept a s rret but the probable action of the
committee in this case has leaked out.
Tue great difficulty in getting a coach
hitherto has been the high price de
manded* but it is believed in this instance
the diffi culty has teen or will be obviated.
It has been definitely conceded that But
terwbrth will not coach the team again
this year, and in afl probability his place
will be .taken by the athletic ex-captain of
the Brown team.
â 'Nott will be an assistant in. my depart
ment," said Professor W. A. Setchell, head
of the department of botany, to:day, "and
will study in anticipation "*>f the doctor's
degree. To secure. this degree it will take
him -at least two and perhaps three years
of study und original .research.
"â He is already classed as a well-ad
vanced student of botany, and has done
very efficient work under my instruction.
He is not only a student of the first order,
but also an- athlete through and through.
He is a foo.iba.ir player of yastly more tnan
ordinary qualifications, and he uses his
head in a game as well as bis muscle.
That he has'botb of these qualifications is
clearlyeyinced by the way he handled the
Brown" team in their contests against Yaie
and Harvard last y.ear, and by the way he
'made his breaks through the rushline.
â¢ ".Brown put .up two remarkably strong
games in both her contests against' the
'big' teams, and she scored a practical
victory in the Harvard match. Never be
fore -in the history of Brown University
have such strong football games been put
by her men, 'and I am constrained to be
lieve that the remarkable showing which
was made, particularly hi the Harvard
game, was due to the .energy and skill
exercised by Captain Nott. His work with
tue. players was. not all done at the time
of xhe contests by any manner of moans,
but was commenced long before and
pushed vigorously. He took almost com
plete charge of- the entire proceedings of
the training season, and acted in the ca
pacity of captain, coach and trainer. His
direction of the men as to their exercise,
their babi.ts regarding rest and their diet
won for him almost as much distinction
as bis guidance of their moves after the
pigskin on tne- field.
"He is therefore especially well quali
fied fnr a coach such as the University of
California men need. Thecoachers which
have come here from the East thus far
iave done very good service I understand,
but none of them have had any extended
experience in the training nt men such as
falls within tbe duty of a cap am. Nott
nan not only shown himself as an
efficient captain, but also as a vigorous
player on the team. He has therefore a
double advantage over those men who
have done nothing but buck the line or
make strategic plays back of it.
"Nott never loses his head, but is calm
and collected even under the most trying
circumstances and iv the very midst of a
heated game.
"Brown had a large number of good
players last year, but none of them were
so eminently fitted for the position of cap
tain as Charles P.. Nott. His popularity
and standing among his college associates
at Brown did not rise as a bubble and
burst at tbe first gust of wind, but he has
steadily grown in their estimation until
now he is even more popular than at the j
time of tbe < reat game against Harvard.
"I firmly believe that it will certainly be
a great stroke for Berkeley if he is finally
decided upon as coach, lor the coming sea- j
son, knowing as I do his qualifications for
the position. He is a man who can take
the team frora the opening of the season
and carry them through until the great
annual intercollegiate without weakening
under the strain of responsibility, or
without being at a loss to know which
way to turn.
"What will be more than his ability asa
coach, a captain and a player, will be his
interest in tbe university and the loyalty
to it which he will evince. He comes here
to be one of us, to enlist under the colors
of the blue and gola in his effort 10 secure
the doctor's degree from the department of
botany and not for the purpose of earning
his allowance as coach for the season.
"We may consider ourselves fortunate
in getting him to coma to this Coast, as he
leaves a position of much more pecuniary
value in order to study here and to do
what be can for football. He will take the
position in my department occupied by
Ivan Tiedestrom last year, and will aevote
himself largely to the study of seaweeds
and types of that character.
"He has been an assistant in botany at
the Marine Biological Laboratory at
Wood's Hole, Mass., for the past two
.summers. His choice as coach is highly
favcred by the advisory committee of the
Athletic Association, and the indication*
that he will be the leader of Berkeley's
team for 1896 are very strong and I can
say witu every element of safety that he
will be a most valuable man in the posi
tion, and a competent adviser in all other
matters pertaining to the arrangements of
tne season."
Captain Nott is tbe son of a Brattleford,
Vt., clergyman and is now in his twentv
fourlh year. He stands about 5 feet 10
inches and weitrhs when in training about
178 pounds. He is dark complexioned
with thick black hair, and is of a quiet
disposition, always being aware of what he
is about.
He has broad shoulders, a well-de
veloped chest and powerful muscles of the
chest, and back. He is regarded by com
mon consent as one of the finest speci
mens of physical manhood in the Inter-
I collegiate League. He has done enough
farm .work j to develop his .'â¢ muscles to a
high degree, but ' not enough to destroy
his muscular equilibrium. â¢

STILL HUNTING
THAT SHORTAGE,
Several Times Its Amount
Already Spent in the
Chase.
A HARVEST FOR EXPERTS
The Auditor Apparently Un
justly Clouded for a
Year.
NO CLEW TO THE LOST MONEY.
Recent Experting Makes It Appear
That the Tax Collector Was
to Blame.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Aug. 1. i
After nearly a year of investigation tbe
shortage of $480 in the county treasury
nas not yet been traced. Auditor Whid
den was held responsible by a former
Grand Jury and nine indictments were re
turned against him.
Only one of his cnarges was brought to
triai. All manner of technicalities were
brought forward and it .was sought to in
validate the whole of tbe Grand Jury's
acts, because one of their members, while
in a fit of temporary insanity, committed
suicide.
After several months consumed in. legal
argument the indictments were all
quashed, and the matter ordered by tbe
court to be referred to the next Grand
Jury. â¦
The present Grand Jury took the scan
dal up, and it was found. to be necessary
that the county expert should go. carefully
over each tax-stub and compare with the
books. This consumed several months,
and. many times tbe $480 have been spent
in chasing the elusive shortage. Grand
Jury's fees have been piling up during the
successive sessions, and at times two ex
perts have been at work, and it 13 now es
timated that not less thai. $3000 has been
spent, and tbe expenses are not yet fin
ished.
It. has now been discovered that the
ex-Tax Collector, A. J. Rosborough, aid
not turn over his books in good shape,
and that the .fault, ma-y be in his depart
ment. Some niorfe experting will forth
with be done, and if- it shall be found that
the .shortage is Rost)or<sugb'3 the Grand
Jury will recommend that a civil suit toe
commenced against him to recover the
amount.
Air. Rosborough has now been out of
office nea-rly two years arid he. denies the
responsibility of the shortage. The books
have been out of bis jurisdiction for so
long a time that be does not feel justified
in accepting the shortage unless an exam
ination is made under his supervision.
The cost of a Grand Jury is about $100
per day and the experts are paid $5. Tne
latter have been at work for raomhs and
have carefully examined the 50,000 tax
stubs and yet the $480 is missing from the
treasury and riu one can say where it went
or from whence it shall return.

SINGLE-TAX ADVOCATES,
Held an Enthusiastic Meeting
and Raised Money for
Delaware. â 
Congressman Maguire, Ra ph Hoyt
and Joseph Lfggett .Speak cf the*
Newest Issues.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,) -
908 Broadway, Aug. 1. .*{
A well - attended meeting under the
auspices of the advocates of single tax was
held at Hamilton Hall this evening. Tbe
speakers were Joseph Leggett, Ralph
Hoyt and Hon. James. G. Maguire. D.
Stewart presided and introduced the
speakers. During the evening a good
sized collection was taken up to push the
Delaware campaign.
The first speaker was Mr. Lecgett. He
denounced tbe politax in unmeasured
terms and was roundly cheered for his re
marks. Continuing he said:
"I believe there are soma single-tax be
lievers present, but few Know what is
meant by tbe term. At present the As
sessor puts a valuation on your land. If
that were all you would have a single tax",
but it is not all. He then goes and puts
another valuation on the improvements.
Not satisfied with this be goes and puts
another on money or personal property.
Do you imagine a man who Iras money to
lend or sells goods pays the tax? -He
makes. the party using them pay it."
Ralph Hoyt, who has recently'returned
from Delaware, where he was engaged in
the campaign there, said he believed we,
nave reached the bedrock and true reform."
He said the single-tax advocates picked
Delaware as a State to experiment on be
cause there was no barrier, iv the constitu
tion.
The work there has been to educate the
39,000 voterÃ to a rational system of taxa
tion that will not hurt *ny one but will
help all to tbe full fruit of their labor.
[Applause.] It is a remarkable si ht to
see the millionaire, mine-owner, society
leader and men of alt other stamps out
talking to the icnorant but eager listener
as well as tbe educated on this subject.
The are<it desire of single-tax advocates is
to secure control of Delaware and cive the
Nation an example of the workings of
their measure.
Hon. James G. Maeuire was received
with applause. He began by saying the
faces of the people were set in the direction
of industrial emancipation. Continuing,
he said: "For men to live they must pro
cure food, shelter and clothing, and to se
cure these they must have the opportunity

to labor for them. The people begin to
feel as never before that this inexhausti
ble and measureless world of God's is
filled with the raw material for food, shel
ter and clothing of a hundred times the
population of the earth. Personally I am.
in favor of making money freer than it is.
I am in favor of so amending the laws
that no twelve men can bo>d up ibis Na
tion and control all the money of ultimate
redemption and throttle a Nation of 70,
--000,000 people so as to make their own
terms to get the necessary gold. The Gov
ernment never had tne right to sell the nat
nral right of its citizens. It is the duty of
the Government to prevent one citizen in
terfering with the rights of another, and to
preserve the rights, not to sell them.
Whose country is this? [Voice in tue audi
ence, "Rothschild's"]. Rothschild holds
a mortgage on it. '
"It is the country of those who own the
land. How can you call it your country
when others have a title which the court?
hold to be better than yours. The peop;.
are only beginning to realize the extent'
that our land system is making a condition
of servitude of a great number of them."
He closed with a strong indorsement of
the work in Delaware and urged all to
assist in the good work there that the
system might be given a fair and impartial
trial.
A PROMISING ATHLETE

street. He is 18 years of age, 5 feet 7%
inches in height and of sligbt build, for
he weighs, in meager track dress, but 114
pounds..
In March,. lÃ9s, he practiced for the
first time the heel-and-toe movement that
is tbe essential part of fair walking, and in
.a trial on the Olympic Club grounds
covered a mile in abojxt ten minutes.-
Previous to that be had accustomed him*
self to rapid walking in going to and re
turning from the Hich School,' a distance
of ten blocks from ois home. That was
his first training, though he was not
conscious of it at the time.
Young Walsh, now walks- a mile in 7
minutes 3Q seconds. What that means'
may be imagined when it if asserted that
a very great majority of men, take them,
as .they pass on the street and untrained,
cannot run a. mile to a 1 fire in that time.-
For one'who is practically in 'his first year
as a. walker this is remarkable speed. Gen
erally three years are necessary to develop
a walker, and in the larger universities to T
day there are few men whose performances
surDass the work of this beginner. The
intercollegiate record fÂ©Vthe Faeific Coast
is 7 minutes 25 2-5 seconds and was made
over three years ago "by. Henry Tinwn, a
very tall, wiry, long-limbed athlete, who
wa* graduated from Stanford Unjvers.itv
in 1893.
The best previous collegiate record had
been- held by George Foulkes of the"Uni
versity of California. During the last three
years the record has not been threatened.

fornia gave some good exhibitions in the
East a year ago,, but his time here has not
been worthy of note as the performance of
an experienced member of a great athletic
team. Merwin * is, however, a very fair
walker, although hia style is not^the best,
and his height and strength give him an
advantage over a smaller mam Foulkes
was a thick!- set football-player, a "plod
der" in his style of walking and probably
j incapable of very great speed because of
his muscular bui \\. Timm's style is more
like' that of Walsh, an easy, loose-jointed,
rapid movement But Timm's fault was
a left knee that would not' always
straighten completely back before the
heel was raised.
, And a failure to "Jock" the knee or to
have a toe of one foot and a heel of the
â¢other on the ground simultaneously sub

Matters Tropical for iContractor â
.' ,- John M:Key.
On Friday morning fourteen carp*ntera
and two hodcarriers, who were at wo^k on
the new annex to the soboolhouse on
Cortland avenue, -Bernal Heights, went
out on a strike because the contractor,
John MoKey, insisted upon hiring twb.
non-union lathers. The trouble had been
brewing a couoje of days before the walk
out, and the contractor knew that hia re
taining tbe objectionable ruon would re
sult as it did.
For the fast two days there has been
no work done on the building, and if some
.understanding is not 'arrived at by to-.
morrow morninc; developments of an in
teresting character are promised. Several
members of the Building Trades Council
have been sharpening an ax which they
.threaten to use on the contractor, and ac
cording to their remarks the' ring of the
implement may be heard in the Board of
Education rooms at a very eaÂ»rty date.
Without making direct charges at pres
ent they have thrown out a feyÂ» sugges
tions of what rnav be expected. The first
inquiry to be made is liow Contractor Me- .
Key has managed "to-secure so many con
tracts to do sohoolhouse building and re-'
pairine, and "if there is .any particular
friendship oxieting between the contractor
and the architect, C. 1. Haven's. From
what if sMteci Mr. McKey has contracts
for everything from erecting schoolnouse.3 ,
'to calcimining and erecting bulkheads.
Another line of inquiry that will be
made* will be as to .the kind of materi tl
he is using in his work, and if in the
Cortland â¢ ayenue schoolhouse 'case the
specifications call for first of third class â¢
lumber. ' â¢â¢â¢*..

It is stated'that a petition is being circu

â¢duty, had won the confidence and respect of
their Â£ellow-m"ember.s and reached a position
where their counsel and advice were daily in
demand. Such is the position now occupied
by the honorable gentleman who for six years
has faithfully represented the people oi the
Fifth Congressional District of this State. By
careinl attention to his legislative duties and
a strict adherence to an honest purpose he
has steadily gained in the estimation of his
fellow-members, until to-day he is at the head
"of one of Â»be most important committees of th,e
House, a commiitee to which is intrusted the
legislative affairs of our vast and complicated
postal system, involving as it does about one
tifth of the entire annual expenditures of our
National Government.
On the floor of the House he always com
.mands respectful attention and, though gen
erous to those with whom he may differ, ne
â¢neither asks nor expects quarter respecting a
matter of principle to which he has given his
adherence. Mr..Chairman, these are not mere
idr-3 words. I speak from personal knowledge,
and I say to you that in neither branch of
Coneress is there a man that stands for more
of official integrity and all that goes to make a
careful, safe and efficient representative than
does Eugene'F. Loud.
. Let me cite you a single illustration among
â¢the many that could be brought to your atten
tion respecting the standing and influence of
Jlr. Loud in the lower house of Congress. One
of the measures which I had the honor to as
-.si.-u in urging upon that body involved
an appropriation of a quarter of a
mil. ion of dollars, which we sought to obtain
through the medium of the H-ouse Committee
on Rivers and Harbors. '
The entire delegation from Ca-lifornia labored
earnestly and harmoniously and with ah the
zeal for which Caliiornians are noted to secure
this appropriation. But it was uphill work.
If was a Presidential year; the Government
was runninu behind at the rate of live millions
or m,ore a -month 'as a .result of Democratic
tinkering; a cry for economy in National ex
penditures had gone abroad, and, notwith
standing the able and united efforts of the
California delegation, there still remained
At the Convention of the J^ifth Congressional District, Held Yesterday in This City, E. F. Loud Was
Nominated for Conrgess ; : Cla-us Spreckels and ex-Senator James Lowe for Presidential Electors.
grave dou.bts' as to the action of the coramiMefi
. to-which we had' made our appeal, and I con
.fes 1 - I felt somewhat Bjscoyraged: 'At this
juncture I appealed* to Mr. Loud and asked ,
â  him to use his personal influejice with those,
â¢in whose hafids lay the decision of. our 'cause.
My appeal .was not in vain. ' As soon as he re
alized the gravity of the situation 'he went to !
work quietly but effectively and with a deter
mination and tenacity I have never Seen ex
celled, uo.r did he cease hfs labors until the
scale had turned-in our favor and the'Califer
nia delegation here enabledHo record a victory
as complete as it had been difÃcult'ro obiois.
Nor is it alone in Ithe halls of legislation
that' Eugene Loud has proven Ms lovo of
to'untry nnd fidelity to principle. During the
fiercest civil conflict the world has ever seen,
he followed the brave and gallant Sheridan, to j
a hundred victories.and left upon the Nation's !
roll of honor the record of a. brave' and patri
otic soldier. In war and in peaÂ«e, he has ever
been the .same unflinching patriot, loyal citi
zen and devoted- friend.
Su chÂ«ir, is the man"for w4iom I speak to
day. And now, without further commenda
tion of him whom I .have learned to honor for
'his proven worth, 'l place â¢before' this co,pven- .
.tion for its corrsideration the name of Eugene I
F. Loud.
In seconding the nomination of Con
gressmaH Loud, Charles M. Shoffridge
spid tbat. he believed that many of tne
delegates before him Wepe present in "the
Hotel Vendome in SaivJose six yea'rsago
when the'' Hon. ."Euge'ne F. Loud was first
nominated. At that time that very dis
tinguished thai very shre"wd
politician, Thomas J'.- Clunie, who by good
fortune had occupied h;j3 seat in Congress
when* the Republican majority passed a
bill for a Postoffice in San Jose, claimed
the credit of that action of Congress. The
old granger, Trmothy, Guy Phelps, grew
sick Â»nd retired from the finht and in
looking over the ranks of tbe members oi
the â¢ Fifth Congressional District they
found Eugene F. Loud to take up .the
banner ot tb,e"Republican party and carry
it to success. He was. nominated and was
triumphantly elected over the" very able
Congressman, Mr. Clurie.
There was not a man there on that day
who believed that Mr. Loud had a shadow
of a chance for election. It looked as
though Clunie were invincible. During
the last campaign, when they nominated
that respectable young man,* Mr. Ryland,
they were told that Mr. Loud could not be
elected, but those who believed that an
honest Congressman can live on $5000 a
year, the people who believed that a Con
gressman should live upon that and not
upon tbe spoils of office, and who believed
that the man who will work faithfully
toward the carrying out of his pledge?, a
man who never flinched in the face oi tbe
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1896.
enemyâ such a man as is Eugene F. Loud
âshould be elected, triumphantly elected
him over Kytand.
"They tell us now." continued Mr.
Shortridge, "that our much respected fel
low-citizen, Judge Maguire.ia invincibleâ
I mean Kelly. [Laughter.] We will de
feat Maffuire afterward. Mr. Loud will
triumphantly carry the Fifth Congres
sional District and go back to Congress to
serve there with the other and greater
statesmen, and will support Air. McKinley
in providing a tariff for California which
will put laboring men to work with their
hands, and not politicians with their
mouths. He will support a policy which
will respect Americans at home and
abroad and who will support the adminis
tration presided over by as distinguished a
soldier as himself. He will support the
administration presided over by a patriot
who believes in the principles you love
and which the American people, in No
vember, will indorse by an almost unani
mous majority, notwithstanding the fact
that the distinguished gentleman from the
West does not propose that a crown of
thorns shall be pressed down upon the
brow of labor, or that it should be cruci
fied upon a cross of gold and notwith
standing that the eloquent gentleman wno
speaks so lovingly of the workingman is
opposed to him.
"I welcome such a contest, where those
who have been tried and not found want
ing are to go up against the untried and
the inexperienced, add 1 am thankful that
I am here to second the nomination of
that honest man and that spotless Repub
lican, Eugene F. Loud."
The speaker was frequently interrupted
by applause.
Mr. Loud, in response to a persistent
call, appeared upon the platform and was
greeted with long continued applause.
He spoke substantially as follows:
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the conven-'
tion: You can hardly anticipate the pleasure
it affords me to indorse the manly platform
enunciated by the Republican party at St.
Louis this year, and with the amendment that
you. have here" put upon the end of the plat
form. Coiil'd any man have'anticipfited that I
â¢would not have indorsed tbe latie'r portion of
that platform when lam pledged to it to-day
and have 'voted upon that proposition from the
very start? I have another session of Congress
to serve, when that' 1 matter must be finally
settled, and no man elected .to Congress this
time will have any \oxe upon any funding bill
whatever.
I have appeared before the people of the
Fifth CorfgreHSiona.l. District in three succes
sive campaigns, and I don't think that any.
person has ever heard me before a convention
or before the peonle say one word in behalf of
myself personally. Some men perhaps cain
greaier notoriety and go to the front more
rapidlj.by proclaiming their own wqrth, but I
bave. always "believed that a man must be
jiideea.by his actions. A time, however, comes
in the lives of most men when, perhaps, they
are called upon to defend themselves for their
mvn aake. For twenty years did that fearless
statesman, John Sherman, remain silent under
.the. villainous" accusation that he had been the
â¢instigator of lhe so-called crime of 1873 until
1893, when that hoary traitor Senator Stewart
was vilifying a man in his grave unable to
protect himselfâ Hooper of Massachusetts.
Then Senator Shelman rose in his place and
said: "The time has come for us to place the
truth.before the American people." â¢
Mere Mr. Loud read an extract from
Senator Sherman's speech, in which he
'quoted Senator Stewart as saying that
gold was tne only standard, and not paper
money, irredeemable in gold, and tbat the
'laboring man should receive a dollar that
will have the purchasing power of a dol
lar. Everybody knows what a dollar in
gald is worth, said Senator Stewart. Mr.
Lpud'continued:
Senator Sherman showed by the record that
he had voted against the demonetization act,
and that this arch vilifier, Senator Stewart,
had voted for it. 1 would not defend myself
against any accusations that could be made if
I were the only party implicated, but the time
has come when I must speak. You of this con
vention have been accused of being the hire
lings of bosses and corporations; that you were
brought here almost with a lasso around your
necks and forced to nominate Eugene F. Loud
for Congress. Ah, you have been slandered,
not I, and you to-day mvs t speak the truth as
becomes yourselves. If it be the truth, then
d"n't vote for me; and if it is a falsehood, then
speak in no uncertain tones.
â¢ Gentlemen, I have rested under the lash for
some t.ime. It has fallen upon my personal
back as the gentle rain in the spring upon the
buddinj: flower. I was accused during the last
campaign of never having risen upon the
floor of Congress to utter a single word. When
the Fifty-fourth Congress assembled and the Re
publican party for the first time was in a com
manding position In that body the accusation
wbs hurled back by placing your bumble
servant at the head of one of the most im
portant committees in the House of Represen
tatives.
An intimation bad been made that I bad re
ceived through some corrupt means lar^e land
holdings in San Benito County. You all have
heard it. They said, "This man Loud, the no
torious, of cattle-ranch fame." It is no trirne
to own land, but let me say to the man or the
source from which it emanated that if he will
prove that I own or tbat I have an Interest in
one acre of land in the county of San Benito,
or in the State of California or in the United
States, I will deed It to one or more orphan
asylums that he may designate, and if that
offer is not sufficiently generous I will deed il
to him, and that may prompt him to investi
gate.
lam to-day in the Republican party to stay
as long as God shall give me strength. Thave
fouffDt to sustain that flag, and I have labored
ever since I was able to vote for the perpetuity
of the principles of the great Republican party
which has made us the greatest Nation on the
face of the earth, and no man or set of men can
drive me out of the party.
When Abraham Lincoln was nominated our
country was threatened with disruption. It is
threatened to-day with financial disruption,
which is more ruinous to any country than
the segregation of any portion of it. Have you
noticed that the strength of the movement
comes from the Eame part of the country?
Do you notice that the united solid South is
now in earnest advocacy of that system which
will destroy any country on the face of God's
earth, and that there is arrayed against it the
honest yeomanry of the North and West?
The Democratic party in 1896 have discov
ered that the sole pnnacea for all the ills and
evils from which this country is now suffering
must be cured by that magic word, "16 to 1."
Has not this country been prosperous under
its present condition ? Was there ever a coun
try more prosperous on the face of the globe
than the United States from 1873 to 1893?
Why, if this was the sole cause of all our ills,
didn't we fail until the Democratic party came
into power, pledged to reform our tariff? In
the words oi Tom Reed, "A man deceived once
is human, but a man deceived twice by the
same party is a fool."
After the close of Mr. Loud's speech he
was nominated by acclamation.
Chairman Watt addressed the conven
tion and said tnat he desired to nominate
for Presidential elector a man whose
name was the synonym of enterprise,
liberality and progress, of devotion to the
best interests of the people, of sympathy
with the working people.
"This gentleman," added Mr. Watt,
"has done more for the advancement of
tbe prosperity of the State of California
than any other five men who can be
classed together in this State. He has set
the wheels of procress in motion; his
mills and his railroad are in course of con
struction, his buildings are being erected
in this City, and wherever his enterprise*
are being carried on there will you find
the people rallying to his support. That
man you all know â the Hon. Claus
Spreckels."
Mr. Spreckels' name was greeted with
prolonged applause, and he was nom
inated Dy acclamation.
For the position of alternate elector,
Senator James R. Lowe was nominated
Dy acclamation.
The chair was authorized to appoint a
finance committee of five, and the con
vention adjourned.
WILL NOT ACCEPT.
Hilborn's Friends Denounce the
Action of the County Cen
tral Committee.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. I.â The rooms
of Congressman Hilborn were filled to-
night with his friends, who denounced the
action of the County CommiMee and
everything done at to-day's meeting.
They declared tbat the election of the
delegates at large was clearly illegal, and
that the whole proceeding was prear
ranced. J. C. Boatman, Hilborn's secre
tary, stated that the decision of the county
committee to name all of the election of
ficerÃ is in direct violation of the recom
mendation of the State Central Commit
tee, and under no consideration will they
accept it. They decided that they would
take no part in the primary and tbat they
would refer tbe whole matter to the State
Central Committee.
A NEW SCHOOL YEAR.
Opening of the Fall Term at Heald's
Business College.
A gratifying testimony to the popularity
and high standing of Heald's Business
ColleL-e is the fact that despite the hard
times the full enrollment shows a marked
increase in the attendance. The advant
ages of sending young men and women to
an institution of this kind rather to the
higher grades of the public schools are be
ing more apparent each year. Pupils are
taught in one-third of the time and are
not obliged to pursue studies for which
they have no liking.
After completing the course graduates
are fitted to immediately enter business
life as salaried employes. There is a con
stant demand for bright young men and
women, as was shown by the long list of
graduates or Heald's Business College
placed in positions, published in these
columns a month ago.
Every department of the college has re
cently been strengthened and several
thousan-1 dollars spent on tbe interior
equipments.
The first student to graduate from the
electrical eneineering department secured
a position yesterday as electrician with the
San Gabriel River Electrical Company at
a hi"h salary.
The fall term begins to-morrow, but as
the instruction is individual, students can
enter with equal advantage at any time.
During the month of July fifteen short
hand pupils of the college were placed in
positions and there is at all times a strong
demand for Heald's graduates.

'.â  . It Is Braver to Live
: â¢ It has happened to each of us that alone we have come
irom agpe at unknown; we live out "the" span called life with
:he same passions, emotions, sweeping over bur souls, and â 
later we go alone into the infinity beyond. Those are the
mam cpmlitiQns in life's problem; civilization has coinpli
cafed waiters for us by evolving powerful forces., intellectual
and ethical; and rioWj at this close of thÂ« nineteenth century,
so great is the need for. light on the .subject, that a great â 
paper mnÂ«t needs ask, "Is life worth living? Is suicide
justifiable?" â¢ -The whole universe is governed by far- reaching
law. All evolution shows law. Obedience to law Is the
gxe*t. rule of.,the universe. . :
It is the iawthat man shaJLbe born; shall live,' and shall
die when the tim.e comes in the due process of law. This '
cannot be broken without result somewhere, somehow, any
more than cm nny other well-determined law; even- if there
â¢were not any ethical reasoning to guide us. N.ot letting the
teachings or Christianity enter into the problem,, there is an
unwritten standard, whrch will not let a man go down before
defeat. True, bravery never consists in laying down arms, â 
It means stay by the rig-bt till the finish!
Life is. great,- forceful, mighty, o." infinite possibilitiesâ
to be lived out to .the end, be that end bitter or sweet. We
may govern its conditions, if. we tryâ we can-not end them.
No laws can be -made for one individual onlyâ no one
can make law's for nimself, neither may he break the laws, â¢ \
written or unwritten, which govern the human' race. ' I
But because we know the exceeding bitterness of .life
conditionsâ because. with infinite sympathy we. -divine the. j
pathos in our neighbors' livesâ we mrght much pftener take 1
a comrade bythe hand and say, "Friend, let me. -help thee J
over the hard place in thy road, it will' be thy turn later on . . |
to be berpfui." â¢â  . " . Molue E/ Conners, â¢' \ j

Most Suicides Insane
I believe that 95 per cent of the people who .convmit sui
cide are insane or laboring under temporary aoerration of .
the mind. Perhaps the percentage is too small. There, are '
exceptionally few persons who will: deliberately take their
own lives, for two reasons. ' '. *.
In tae first place suicide, rather than being an act of
cowardice, "requires a tremendous deaj of courage,, if it be
consciously committed. ..â¢:_â¢â 
Secondly, people who would so Jisrhtly dispose of their
own. lives have no belief in moral responsibility, nor in the
compensatory forces of the spiritual life,;fbr the knowledge
that they descend into darkness and. annihilation would
neutralize the physical; courage they might have to take
their own lives. . : â¢'. ' j
So suicide- being, generally an act for which" the 'mind is
not responsible, it is almost useless to set up. the question of
its being justifiable. 'To be-sure it is not justifiable if we
admit that it can dp a saner act, but -the argument against the
justifiability cf it has been presented co often that it is not '
necessary to say another word about it. â¢ â¢ '
Jacob YoorsangerJ \
Thinks Suicide Should Be Encouraged
. ' â¢ â¢ . â¢ v->
Dr. G-ustav Eisen, curator of microscopy of the Academy ot Sciences and- discoverer of the independence of the
centrosome, said : " I suppose that my views on suicide are likely to shock a great many people, particularly when
I say that I think that under many circumstances self-destruction is a good thing. In fact, I think that it should
be encouraged. â¢ .'."..â  â¢ â¢
"To me there is no disgrace in some people committing suicide. In fact, many people would be committing
the best and most useful act of their lives-. The .old vikings of Northern Europe always made it a practice to end
their own lives. If history is to be believed, it was a disgrace for them to die in bed, as it indicated that the person
had lip regard for those around him. The old men who had." survived many long years of battle, as soon as tliey
felt that they were not fit to fight as they did in the old days made it a practice to jump off a precipice and be
crushed to death it the bottom.' These meri received ah honorable funeral and were revered in the legends of the
people.. But those who were.-too. cowardly to. end their existence, and, instead, waited in bed for the arrival of
death, were simply hauled to the place of burial and 'everything was done to keep them from being remembered.
In the case of brave young men who died of unconquerable diseases, such rules were of course cast aside.
"But there is another side-to the .question, and. that is when a man who is a help to the nation and a head of a
family commits suicide to rid himseli of tiis cfwn troubles. Such action is to be despised, as it is selfishness."
If AD Dependsâ
Captain I. W. Lees., chief of ' the detec
tive force of this City, -does not beliave in
the moral right of a man to take' his life,
biit his belief is. qualified.. He says: â¢ â¢
"It all depends on circumstances. Sup
pose a m an is sick, and . that he knows* he
muat die;- doctors whom he trusts have
toiid him so, and he .-feels it himself. â  Sup
pose he ijs in 'pa in, and to fiTe is. only to
prolong his sufferings; Hasn't he the
right to end it all at 6nce? ..
"I own f ' don r t- like to -s.ay exactly
whether he has the rigbt or not; People
may hot credit it, -b'.ut I am a good
churchman and a believer in the Bible.' 1
am. satisfied to .take what the Bible says,
and suicide is- forbidden in the Bible;" â¢ â¢
Â¥Â¥Â¥â â â 
If a Good Thing â ;
So the newspapers are taking interest in
the "prevailing epidemic?" It is time, for,
if suicide is a good thing we can' t have too
much of it and the sooner we all take" our
selves off/ an-d thus, sdlve tne "destiny of
the race" tf>e better. But "if bad it 'is a
good time to -mane quest of, the cause. â  Of
this the lengthening daily list is proof. '
But realty it .is not a-matter of wonder
that so manV",of the landlords' helpless,
hopeless slaves commit suicide. ' There is
no secret.abojat" it. The marvel is that so
many of. them don't. When hope of ob
taining the means to a. rational existeuee
bras utterly fled it requires far more cour
age to live them to die..- Hunger, want and
the fear â bo," the certainty of more, and
worse in store 'sd enervate the character
and- destroy the moral force that there is
notbine Jeff' for that courage to feed" on
which isÂ»req*uisite to continue the struggle
agatast the-'dreadful odcis. The institu
tion of land ownership has a "dead cinch"
on tb^ earth â the means df existence.
The masses of men, women and children
therefore,, live o.nly on such terms as the
owners of the eartb see fit to impose.- The
term are limited' "only by the avarice of
the â¢aijh-owhers. _ Abolish the institu
tion,of landbwnershtp; swing wide open
the^ates that shut men off the unused
larrd; proclaim industrial freeddm to the
famishing, heart-broken slaves.and suicide
wirl speedily 'be as a tale that is told.

AU Suicides* Afe. Insane
A. St HallidjLe, ex-president of the Me
chanics Institute, said: "It is a subject
that has-employed the thcught and specu
lations of men from the earliest times.
.Libraries of books have been written upon
the topic, and yet^it remains as" obscure as
at the beginning; a matter upon which
every man must form his own opinion if
he cares to haye one. " For .myself, I be
lieve thart no sane man commits suicide.
The act is. to.my mind, an evide'nee of in
sanity, however sane the person may have
appeased immediately before the act. The â¢
hereafter? We do not know ahont-that.
tyen are placed here for a purpose no
doubt.' We cannot say that when a man
reaches tha,t point where he himself cuts
off bis own life he has not by that very
sign accomplished hisdestiny. AVhoshall
say that it is an interruption â that there
migiit have been more for him to do? It
is my belief, as I say, that a man who
commits suicide must be insane.

What Dreams May Come!
Bhakespeare says: "Oh that the Everlasting had not
fixed His canon 'gainst self-slaughter!"
Generally speaking suicide scarcely seems a justifiable
means of terminating one's earthly career. It is frequently
considered as a cowardly escape from difficulties that might
be'ieadily overeonve by a little further exercise of personal
. determination. I do not think sutih a sweeping generaliza
tion is' altogether warrantable.
From one point of view it requires less courage to live,
because we haye a .reasonable knowledge of what to-morrow
may" bring us, whereas the future is to many an unknown
country, and to s.uch people that plunge into the dark it
requires some considerable courage.
.' . Punishment in the old-fashioned sense I do not believe
in. _ Instead, I affirm the doctrine of consequence. That is
to say, the consequences of a man's life become the deter
mining factors to his personal condition hereafter.
Suicide is resorted to to. escape mental, moral or affec
tional worries, disgraces or disappointments. Now, unless
by tb,e act the individual can destroy those portions of his
nature he must necessarily take them with him with all
that belongs to them at the time when he so unceremo
niously shuffled off the mortal coil.
â¢ .As a matter of fact, he merely changes his condition of
existence but not his state of consciousness. This fact, for
fact it .is, is the strongest argument against and the greatest
condemnation of suicide.
As we can never know the innermost thoughts of our
fellow;creatures, it is unwise and unjust to condemn even
the apparently most unreasonable suicide. J. J. Morse.
â¢ Lecturer of California Psychical Society.
'â¢ Â¥ Â¥ Â¥ Â¥ Â¥
When a Man Is Useless
Is a man justified in committing suicide? Will 8. Green,
the United States Surveyor-General, thinks that he isâ under
certain, circumstances. .
."Yes, there are times when a man is perfectly justified,
and is even to be commended for putting an end to his
earthly existence," said the official who is better known as
the editor of the Colusa Sun. "When a man believes that
he is of no use to himself, to his family or to his country,
ami 'does not believe in a life hereafter, I think the best
thing be can do is to end an existence that is a misery to
himself and a burden to bis family or to the community.
â  Â»*I believe in a God and in a hereafter, but I believe that
God in passing judgment upon such a case as I have cited
.will consider the causes that led to such a result and not to
â¢the going to sleep,' which clearly resulted from other
causes for which the person was responsible. God will no
deubt pass judgment according to general natural laws in
stead of on special laws for one act, the act of taking one's
life. Would you not suppose that the punishment would
â  be'as c^eat for the acts that lead to self-destruction as it
wouid be if the miserable man had decided to drag out a
miserable existence for many years longer? I think it
would', and therefore I justify a man not desiiing to inflict
his miserable presence upon a community when he is even
a nuisance to himself."
Â¥Â¥Â¥ Â¥ Â¥
From a Spiritualist
Spiritualistic philosophy teaches us not to commit sui
cide, because in that other existence we do not get rid either
of our trouble or ourselves. We recognize the fundamental
fact that man is a spirit and that at death he only changes
his environment but does not mitigate the evils of this state.
According to our belief a man cannot escape the reaping of
bis sowing.
Personally I believe suicide, under certain circumstances,
is perfectly justifiable. If I were being eaten up by a cancer
or any other incurable malady, so that my life's continua
tion meant only menace to the living, I should take the exit
dv the shortest route aud relieve both my fellows and myself.
Stili, I would not wish to say any toO re that might encour
age the mania.
There must be something radically wrong with civilization
that causes people to make away with themselves, resrard
less oi the consequences. De. N. S. Ravlix

have entertained the idea of suicide for ourselves, so as to consider the prefer
able form of it; and how far we are actually reserving for ourselves the possi
bility of it, and on what grounds. It would be more than interesting to make
this inquiry ; it would be supremely helpful in the way of a fair examination of
the whole subject.
Within the memory of some of us there has occurred among the thoughtful
of the world a change of mind in regard to future rewards and punishments
that is almost unparalleled in the history of thought for rapidity, radicalness
and importance. Men, with more or less consciousness of what they were
doing, have thrown off the idea of a God and future state of arbitrary rewards
and punishments, and are coming under the inward restraints of the idea of a
God and future state of mercy, certainly limited only by regard for man's free
dom, but of exact â natural and inevitable â justice â requiring that which has
been given. But this, as an interior basis of judgment, is to most minds so far
indefinite, open to various interpretation and evasion, and needing for its full
efficacy a training of mind and conscience that we are but slowly subjecting
ourselves or our children to. At first glance, too, it seems easy upon our self
indulgences, and we promptly avail ourselves of the letting-down; but, in its
working, it is very terrible, excluding absolutely all vicariousness and inter
cession in the sense of remission of penalty; all of propitiation of an arbitrary
will; all postponement, even of judgment, and leaving us stripped of our ap
pearances, nafced in the presence of truth. It works back also to the half
admitted justification of suicide, and, above all, to the beginnings of suicide
in the trifling with life, in the practices of selfishness that are justified by the
plea thut it concerns no one but ourselves. What else than this falsity is the
thought of the modern rich that they may do what they will with their own?
I believe that suicide in its essence is far more prevalent even than we have
assumed; that it is present in all idle trifling with the gifts of God of all kinds;
and that if we could but see in the light of heaven the act or neglect ot act of
many of us every day of our life that is suicidal in its essence, it would be more
shocking than the most revolting suicide. I believe in condemning in strongest
terms the cowardice, the fatuity, the wickedness of the suicide, but I believe
the evil will be eradicated only as we see and labor at its roots.
Rev. Joseph Worcester, Pastor Swedenborgian Church.
Man Comes Back to Live Again 5
The prevalence of suicide among Western people is due entirely to wrong 3
U conceptions of life. These in their turn are the result of materialistic teach- 3
Â£Â» ings of both religion and philosophy. The pure materialist flouts the idea that 3
C although in the midst of eternity he will ever have other than a fleeting 3
jo glimpse of sentient life. For him the tragedy of existence consists of one act, 3
g and then the curtain is rung down forever. 3
I Egotism and ignorance have led men in the West to fancy themselves a 3
class of beings haying nothing in common with the rest of nature. Did they oj
but recognize that God is in every portion of the universe, working out in each 3
the divine will by infinitely varying methods, they would begin to suspect 3
that the stupendous processes of evolution, going on all about them in nature, 3
and occupying untold eons of time, might have some significance lor the 3
human soul itself, but another manifestation of Divinity. oj
Looking at life from this larger viewpoint, we must believe that man is a 3
portion of his= planet, and that ne will remain and evolve upon it until it can 3
no longer afford him new, helpful, conscious experiences. And this is the 3
theory to which a very large majority of the people of the earth subscribe uu- 3
der the name of reincarnation. Reincarnation is the very process of human 3
evolution. 3
For the law'of cause and effect is the unalterable will of God, and all evo- 3
lution, human or not. must proceed under" its inflexible decrees. Therefore, as 3
an individual center of conscience, the soul â and each soul â has of its own free 3
will evolved that character which has made its present experiences necessary, :3
no matter how unhappy they may be. Nature is infinitely wise and infinitely 3
o just, and it is her will, expressed in the law of cause and effect, which has 3
Jo brought to the sufferer just those experiences necessary to correct some evil or 3
1Â° vicious trait, or to balance evil he has inflicted upon others in some past life. 3
jo Therefore the suicide is a rebel against the Infinite; one who is trying to evade e3
1Â° the consequences of his own acts. 3
He cannot succeed. Torn out of the body with the thought of suicide 3
g .dominating his whole being, it will remain the dominating thought during 3
C years of untold apony. He will repeat in his imagination all the grewsome 3
>o details of hi 3 suicide, year after year, trying in vain to escape from himself. 3
C No power in heaven nor upon earth can prevent this, for he has appealed to 3
Â£ the infinite law of cause and effect, and he must abide its action. 3

Suicide Cowardly and Unmanly 3
II cannot imagine any circumstances that would justify a man in commit- 5
ting suicide. Suicide is, from vmy point of view, a cowardly and an unmanly 5
act. The true man will endure with fortitude whatever fate has in store for" o(
: him, and bravely live out his allotted span of life. Committing suicide is like 3
"> deserting in the face of ; the enemy. : There is nothing heroic in it. My ideal ; ".. . 3
: hero is the man who stays with the fight to the end whatever betides. 5
. 1 believe that the prevalence of suicide is both a sign and a proof of the ex- 3
istence of social disease in the body politic l I also believe i that the disease is , Â°j
remediable and curable. Poverty ana fear of want are undoubtedly responsi- 3
b!e for a very large . proportion , of â  the suicides that occur in civilized society. 3
But neither involuntary poverty nor the dread of it could have any existence . 3
in a" system of civilized ; society ; based >upon .principles of justice and reason. 3
. To assert the contrary is to blaspheme the Maker as well as to write the 9
asserter -, down as an ignoramus. We do know that poverty 'is 3
v, riot due to the I niggardliness ;of ; nature, . nor to the oversight of the Cre- 3
Â» ator. We know that its existence ami its persistence are due to the violation 3
C ; - of God's law of justice. We propose to abolish all man-made laws that restrict 3
Â£ men in the exercise of their natural right to the use of the earth and rob them 3
Â£Â» of the means of securing a comfortable subsistence' during their sojourn on it. 3"
C When we have succeeded in attaining this object through the instrumentality 3
[o â  of the single-tax there will be no provocation and no excuse for suicide. . ';;,â¢.â¢' . 'â¢

Some Higher Responsibility
Lieutenant Frank Greene, signal officer of the Department of California, U. oj
Â£ 8. A., believes suicide is unjustifiable and, as a rule, the resnlt of cowardice.
"Suicide is wrong," be said. ' 'No man has an}- right to take his lifeâ that is, 3
(o I don't think he has. There must De some higher responsibility on mankind, oj
he mnst owe something to a higher power. He cannot know why he is here 3
Â£ on this earth, and to leave it by means of suicide is shirking his responsibility <p
g as a man â it is cowardice. **
"I know there are men old and sick and apparently useless to themselves 2
(o and to every one else, but they may be happy in their own way, and they may oj
C be fulfilling some destiny. A man's life is not his own â I don't think it isâ it 5
v may belong elsewhere, to his family, for instance, or his country, or to some c(
pÂ» higher powerâ it is not given him to lay dcwn as he pleases. He has a respon- *<
C sibility upon him to live and bear his share of the burdens of this life. He has 3
Â£ no right to desert. Suicide is wrongâ it is cowardly."' ot
Coward or Insane
Very few suicides occur except under
great mental strain, or through a desire
to escape the consequences of some pre
vious act. They would rather flee from
the ills they know rot of than bear those
from which they are made to suffer in this
world.
I do not consider it justifiable for any
human being to take his own life, for it is
either done through cowardice or while
laboring under mental aberratibn. In
the one case it is unmanly and unphilo
sophical, but in the other, of course, there
is no moral responsibility.

When Men Believe They Exist Forever
Professor G. H. Howison, who occupies the chair of philosophy at the University of California, says that nÂ« .â¢
man can really commit suicide. He may escape from the environments which, he thinks, have/ -
caused him to be miserable, but he. cannot escape his own way of regarding his environments, which .-â¢
is really the cause of his unhappiness. Man is an immortal being. He cannot realize the effect of good or evil
deeds done by him in this life unless his existence is continuous. â  , â¢â¢;â¢â¢â¢
"What does the good that a man may do in seventy years amount to in consideration of whafrma,y be done in
eternal life? It ha 3 been argued that consciousness is due to motion. Heat and light are the results of motion, ar;d
science has succeeded in measuring and'recording the motions which so result. No one can determine that- con-*
sciousness is caused by motion without establishing a similar successful and accurate test, which never can, be done:
What is that whicb we call material? Is it not material to you simply because you perceive it to be so? In some*
period of existence every person may realize the evil in him sufficiently to have the : evil become a regenerating
influence. Some crimes cause those who commit them to be shocked so at their own depravity .that "they are â 
thereby turned to better ways. It is possible that a suicidal attempt may be a turning point. The teachings of
the State University are all in opposition to Suicide. Probably very few of those who attempt to take their own
lives have ever read a book of philosophy.
A Man's Life Is His Own
I think every man ought to be allowed to decide the ques
tion for himself whether he should take his own life. I
think it would be a crime for any one to advise or encourage
another to commit suicide. But there might be circum
stances under which it might be the wisest thing a maa
could do to put an end to his own existence.
Where the circumstances are such that a perfectly sane
man clearly sees that the prolongation of his Hie will only
result in misery and unhappiness to himself and to others
he might wisely determine to end it.
This, of course, is altogether apart from any religious be
lief. A man who believes in religious doctrines has no right
to take his life under any circumstances, for it would be a
sin for him to do so.
A man's life belongs to himself, and he has the right to
quit it if it becomes too burdensome.
William H. Beatty.
Â¥Â¥Â¥ Â¥ Â¥
Henry M* Gement's Guess
Henry N. Clement said: "It all depends. Circum
stances and conditions must temper our judgment of sui
cide and the suicide as tney should everything else. W T ben a
man has lost his honor, wlien he is irredeemable in this life,
he can do no better thing than to cut it off â provided always
that he leaves his family or those dependent upon him in
circumstances removed from want. Otherwise, if he leaves
them to struggle for themselves under the weight of shame
that he has brought to them then his act of suicide only
adds to his disgrace. Ralston could have done nothing bet
ter. He could not have recovered himself. Personally he
was submerged. By killing himself he incurred no additional
reproach. His memory is softened instead. Without honor
a man better be dead. There are other circumstances that
stand in palliation of suicide. A man has a rigbt to judge
for himself whether he benefits the world most by staying
or going. But for the man who quits the fight leaving
his dependents more helpless than before there is only
the one judgment â that he is or was a coward. For
the man who takes his life as the result of some temporary
embarrassment or through chagrin at some disappointment
or for any other such slight cause there can also only be
contempt. As to how the act of suicide may affect the
future state of the victim, that is a question that none of us
can answer. lam not prepared to believe that God follows
the individual with rewards and punishments after death.
I have sought what information I could from the most
reliable sources, and after my fifty-five years of life I have
come to the conclusion that nobody knows- anything about
it. lam just as good a guesser as any of them, and I can't
guess. I hope for something better, to be sure, but I have
heard or seen nothing to convince me that death does not
end all. lam willing to subscribe to the beautiful sentiment
inscribed on Huxley's tomb.

The Suicide Is a Cowarg
I don't think suicide under any circumstances is justi
fiable. 1 think that in the case of a young man who has
wealth and a good family and a good home and everything
that makes life worth living, it is only extreme selfishness
that can bring him to an act of that kind. Because if ne
stopped for a moment to consider the effect on those who
are near and dear to him he would realize that he owed it to
them to try to make such use of his life as to make them
feel proud of him.
Of course there are times in the life of every man
when the future looks dull and forbidding, but the old adage
that it is a long lane that has no turn can be constantly
applied, and fortune must indeed be a very fickle jade if she
will never smile upon a man.
No matter now discouraging the present prospectsare.it
seems to me that suicide is the act of a coward, because a
man who has any energy or any ambition will certainly try
to surmount the mishaps that befall him. Time will event
ually bring at least a measure of success, and with perse
verance perhaps complete success. Julius Â£ahn.
For Man Is Born Again
The prevalence of suicide in San Francisco is not tb the ,-,
sontemplative mind surprising.
The frantic strains after an artificial existence; the self
ishness and every form of uncharitableness; ambition for
material gain at costs most iniquitous; intemperance, greed,
haste, waste of the precious nervous energy;, the insatiable
thirst for sensation which makes hard and inhuman-thÂ©
conditions of this century's end, are, one and all, sources of
self-destructioD. * â¢ â¢ â¢
The intense suffering which must precede a deed so rash
should render the suicide, even under conditions most re
volting, a creature deserving sympathy and reverence,
from his surviving fellow-men â for we know not what act .
of our own, thoughtless, ignorant or ill-advised, may have
caused the untimely taking 'off of a brother or sister. Each ,
thought and deed should, therefore, be so regulated In our
lives as to make impossible the implanting of bitterness,
desolation or desperation. â¢ ' . â¢
In the soul â that wondrous word with one inhabitant â
there are heights and depths and powers and possibilities
inconceivable to the imagination of mortal mail. This alone
makes suicide an incomparable tragedy, not solely by reason â¢
of the devastating depression widely perversive to humanity
as a whole, but likewise for tÃe harmony in nature which is 1
thereby disturoed, the loug suspension, in the progression of /
spiritual life. '. '
The suicide cannot enter 'into the sweet repose of Karma 1
Loca nor the celestial satisfaction of Denach.aH, because he
has not earned them ; he must, in consequence of 'the* vro-, â¢
latiou of immutable law, be reborn on. exactly the same
plane of consciousness which he has souisht to escape,.,
and thus wear out his allotted earth life, with all his miseries '
intensified, multiplied by compound rate of- interest..,
Wnen the co-operative shall have^aken the place of the
cruel competitive system; w-hen the material is replaced Dy "*.
the spiritual in human calculation; when leisure is wrested.'
from inordinate activity; cynicism* supplanted by reverjETnce
and deference; contempt eradicated by, kindness, and osten
tation no longer nsurps the place of simplicity; when seren
ity rules where feverish haste now holds- sway, suicid-'es VilL' â¢

Might Be. Justifiable â¢
The spirit .should leave this existence as the r-ipened
grain and gradually pass into that other world as the mind
passes from wakefulness to sleep. There are circumstances,
though, that .to. my mind would render sujttde' justifiable.
If one were stricuen with a loathsome disease that meant a
lingerine death- I believe that.wene, the end hastened the
person would be justified in so doinp. . I have beard the
theory expressed that undeveloped spirits are the cause of
suicide, but I can hardly understand how this could .be so.
I believe that when a life is changed sq ruthlessly and
suddenly that the spirit remains for a -period unconscious- in
the succeeding existence, on the 'awakening' afl the^ re
morse and sorrow returns .and abides. witty the spifit until
it has beeu dissipated according to the natural laws. *.
Mrs. Db. Louis ScriLEsiifGiÃ. .* â
Is Never Justifiable
. It is my belief that exceedingly few peoÂ»
pie commit suicide who 'are not insane.
Of coursfe there may be cases where a man
takes his-own life for good cause,. tmt I
believe .that insanity generally- precedes
the act. . I speak tfius from my own expe
rience. Only recently .we had three in the
offices of the society which I represent.
I certainly don't consider selKdestruc
tion justifiable under anyqifcumstances,
. even in a case where a man* has disgraced'
himself. If a man has not got the man
hood to stand up and bear his troubles he
is weak minded in my estimation.
If we had any positive knowledge. o{Â«th'e
other world we might have some excuse
for trying to -get out of this"; > 'but we
haven't, and in my personal opinion it is
legally, mprally and religiously wrong to
do so. . â¢ Frank A. Holbrook. .

Not Unpardonable*
F. W. Dohrmann, president of the Mer
chants' Association: ."I would prefer not,
to talk about a thing abput which I can
know so little. StjrT I* am 'nor one* of <
those who believe that suicide is. the "un
pardonable sin ; that t*e spirit of the vic
tim rushes into the presence of its Maker'
fresh from the crime df murder. I never,
see an account sf a suicide without a
sense of pain; tor I feel fhat it must have .
been the result of intense and generally
long suffering. Suicides are not neces
sarily bad men. The act may be and doubt
less generally is the result 6i such nervous
tension as to have left* the person Â°irre- "
sponsible. In such cases the death is ai
entirely one from natural causes as is
some other that died o^ typhoid fever. If, Â°
however, a suicide is so deliberately and
coolly planned that it ranks as murdir,
then it may be punishable as such in
some future state. My philosophy, how-=
ever, does not carry me Deyondthis life.* .
Â¥ Â¥ Â¥
Sometimes Justifiable
People who commit suicide in most "Â»H
cases are laboring under* a species of
temporary insanity brought about by mis- ,
fortune, cares, anxiety and business, love
or family troubles which they want to es
cape and for that reason perform the.
It is true that many* things occur in
this world which appear unbearable. "To.
a sound mind these troubles appear of a ,
temporary character, while the weaker
mind becomes unbalanced under the un
usual stress and .attempts to end it all by
self-destruction.
I believe, however, that suicide in very '
rare cases could be considered justinable.
Adolph Sctro.

Agrees With Ingersoll
I believe with Ingersoll that a man
should be permitted to go out of this
world whenever he thinks fitâ that is,
when he thinks he would be better off out
or it than in it. I don't see where he iu-^
jures any one by going out of it.
I don't think it is established by any
means that a man who commits suicide is
insane. I believe many men commit
suicide who are perfectly sane. Nor do I*
think it established that the act of suicide
is an act of cowardice. Â£. L. Colkon.

; â . Some Queer
.Table J^lar\r\ers Noted
: % by a Borneo Liady
A' lady friend recently from -Borneo re
quested me to accompany her upon what
might/ be ' properly styled a social .science
(exploration expedition in certain locali
ties/ She said that she. had beard much
concerning the people of San -Francisco
and sUe wished t6 devote her attention to.
acute study of certs Jn types.
"Dear me," she said, "is it true .that in
every restaurant there are autocrats of the
breakfast table? How delightful their
conversation must be. I would so like to
see them." '.
So.we started oot 'to'maKe the acquaint
ance of the autocrats, and I will confess I
.had. some. ' misgivings teat her delightful
anticipations might be too sanguine for
realisation .in- -this workaday world,
especially when" I thought of the delight
ful society of Borneo. .
Â£he wanted- to see everyday types, she
saidâ the. corhmon people, the hoi polldi,
don't you; know, because thfy are so de
ligbtfully natural. Then, again, there is a
â¢turdy independence about them' that is
. â¢ â¢so refreshing. . ' .
.' We went in.to a restaurant, which I will
. not name, bec.a.uÂ»Â« that would be invidi
ous. Besides 1 prefer to leave the inter-
ence that typ.eÂ» are to be found in many
places. We sat. down statable, it was
quite early in the; forenoon, and late brcalc
fasters were abound. Not the bonton, of
course, but tne plain people whom my'
.Borneo friend expected to be delightful.
"Of course," she said; 'San Fran
cisce is fat ahead. of Borneo in some
respects, and (with a Decoming little
blusb) I wajit to learn. I am. ia that
nibod." â  ...
I ttad no objection Xo being a party to
polishing up the Borneoese mind (to coin a
word), and to tell the truth, I much ad
mire -San Francisco, manners, and knew
thai, the types .we would see would still
further point-out the inferiority of Borneo
as the home "of polite society to the corre
Â£DofSding exaltation .of our o-rn place.
We-tooK taa and toast, little to .eat a.nd
little to drink, but our-purpo.se was obser
vation and 'riot- gastronoruiQs. It was a
nice little table .at which. we sat; on the
ladies' side-of the house. The tablecloth
was snowy, "the .plated- warp shiny and
handsome and* the sunshine turned the.
' Ice Ibat clinked in our glasses, into, prisms.
I knew that my hat a-nd -gloves and gown
' were. Btrrctly up to date and my friend
â¢from Borneo had also "caught on" to the
prevailing mode in a progressive and wide
awake fashion which', indicated that if
Borneo was in the direct line of progress
and modern improvements it might be
expected to at once strike a rapid gait â
commensurate, in. fact, with the exacting
demands of San Francisco. .
A' few minutes lafer a dairrty little
creature flutterred rather than walked in.-'.
I am sure thai her eyelashes were not pen
ciled and that no beauty doctor had any
ihaje in her makeup, but she was as fresh
as a peach and as gracious as she was
physically charming. Yes,, indeed, her
voice was soft and sweet as mueic, ana
while she knew that I looked admiringly
at he"f ehe did not become, patronizing ox
over self-conscious, and she was 'too well,
poised to t r y to provoke my admiration
any further. She looked at me curiously,
md I think that she. knew that I am a
writjir tor the press, but that did not
cause her to 5-p.ar for a puff. Is the phrase
"to spar" putting ifc-to. strongly? For. my
'parj I pretended not to see her. I fancy
that (.must be a good hypocrite, for she
really seemed unconscious from then on
that. I was covertly studying her and that

. Did you ever^ee a
real Indian juggler?
Not the ordinary
faker who pretends to
. swallow long sworda
and .flaming torches,
nor the one who
' makes plants grow
with the not innocu
ous rapidity of a gas
oill while you look
on. No, the real ar
ticle, who actually
can prance on curved swords with
razor edges, and, as a prime attraction,
can fence skillfully with a sword in
each hand. Lay low, Saiadin and Ma
homet, for this Bon of India would benead
you bothâ flashing swords right and left
at once, the light glancing from them
like flashes from the aurora borealized
icebergs which crunch together in the ice
ribbed Arctic seas.
There is a rapid succession of flashes
from the table where our study sits.
Something gleaming, a steely blade,
catches andieflects the sunbeam which is
still illuminating our prismatic blocks of
goblet ice. Is it the entree? Never mind
w.hatâ so far as that goes. Tbe point of
interest is this beautiful and sure knife
play.
"Nothing like it in Borneo," said my
friend.
Cleft from hoary scalplock to pudgy
double chin, Saiadin and Mahomet may
. lie under the scimetars which the supple
waist of our Indian juggler cause to sibl
. lantly whistle through air. Slashed to a
nicety, and with neads divided into exact
hemispheres, the skill of the juggler is at
tested by these human relics. Ah ! The
idea thrills me. But there is a skill before
our eyes, which tquais Indian art. Knife
and fork, knife and forkâ they enter the
dish and emerge. They alternately travel
to ruby lips in such rapid succession that
there is hardly a perceptible interval be
tween them. The violet blue eyes of the
study show satisfaction and enjoyment.
"Extraordinary," says my lady from
Borneo. "I "have never seen anything like
it." â¢*'-..'
I think that she was right. I never had
seen anything, so perfect â In its way. We
sat at oar table some time, mechanically
sipping tea and making a vain pretense of
really breakfasting. ' We were really wait
ing for another type, but no one came near
to enliTen our monotony. So I put on my
gloves and we went out. Fifteen minutes
later we were sitting in another restau
rant. There was a repetition of the orig
inal surroundings, snowy cloth, shiny
plated-ware, etc. Tbe tables were "indi
vidual"âthat is, isolated, and a discourage
ment to gregarious feeding. The prices
were a little higher, which fact pro
claimeditself in the smugger waiters and
an additional polish to the table-ware.
"Tea and toast again" and then further
observation.
The lady from Borneo gave an almost
inaudible sniffle of satisfaction. The door
opened and a lady and gentleman entered,
she dainty and delightful altogether, be
somewhat blase, but tall and manly and
with a tendency to ogle pretty girls. My
companion was pretty and Iâ well, let
it go. that my companion was pretty. But
how seemingly innocent she was. Ihe
gentleman intuitively read that I was not
impressed and so he looked at my com
panion. She looked back at him so frankly
and bo inquiringly that he was puzzled
and wondered if he bad not met the lady.
MÂ»n fashion, he reasoned this out with
certain prods of memory along the path
way of logic which bis mind speedily
traveled and concluded that he had not the
honor of her acquaintance. He may have
been a little flattered at her interest in
him. Ido not know about that. Man's
van ily is more susceptible than woman's,
whatever is said. He soon ceased to be
"the drawing-card," to use a theatrical
phrase. Why ?
W.hynot? Had he not come there in
company with a lady? Was her mind
small or could it grasp at Eleusinian mys

I said to ray opposite. She smiled. J
"How do you know? It would be so in
teresting to kDow," signaled back the
lady from Borneo.
The sign was sure enough. The waiter
brought a morning paper and the man
took it.
"Chirrup, cbirrnp," said his little wife
to him, or what would amount to that if
she were really as birdlike as she looked.
She was trying on the ante-marriage pro
grammeâthe tactics of the period when
he listened to her prattle with due regard
to its importance.
Somebody or other had found it neces
sary to tell the newspapers all about why
ne was going to vote or was not going to
vote and the gentleman found this of more
account than the twitterings oi his really
beautiful companion. He plunged into
the paper and was reading about a horse
race, when â
"Cheep, cheep," piped the birdlike wife.
Bat the man hardly looked up, and as
he answered only mechanically, we could
both see that his real attention was for a
"20 to 1 shot," or something like that, of
which the paper told him.
The bird plumage ruffled. She would
not be ignored without a protest.
"Chip, chip I" The sound came from
between her lips, which were, I think,
naturally redâ or if they we.re not the color
was well put onâ with the emphasis and
sharp accept of a very business-like and
not altogether amiable English sparrow.
Then he looked up. He recognized a
danger fignal. What said the lady from
Borneo? You must judge whether she
wa9 sarcastic according to your knowledge
of the Borneoese mind.
"I never saw anything like that in
Borneo," she said slowly.
I am reasonably hardened against the
outre. I have seen so many persons in
our public restaurants use the tablecloth
for a napkin and soil the interior of the
supar-bowl with muddy stains from their
individual spoons that I hardly think it
worth while to dwell upon such happen
ings as these. Nor may it be necessary to
descant at any great length on those men
monsters who place their knives in their
respective mouths and use them as if they
were plasterers, putting into crannies suc
cessive layers or strata. The party who
sits at table with toothpick in mouth is
also not enough of a raraavis to entitle him
to be specifically put down. All these my
Borneo friend looked at, cogitated about,
and I would have given a shiny silver do I
lar to know what she thought concerning
tbe people who were contributing to her
social and intellectual progress. She only
sipped tea demurely and concealed her
feeling behind a velvet mask, which was
as impenetrable as chilled steel.
The scenic revelations from one table at
which we sat, I will be bound for a cer
tainty, brought up pictures of a far dis
tant land to my lovely companion. In the
Half dusk of a tropical forest of Borneo,
the cheery Simian customarily depends
from the gnarled and lusty branches of
tbe immemorial banyan tree, holding on
with a prehensile tail. What he dines on
or how he eats it I don't know nor care.
He may eat cocoanuts, first breaking them
to get at the milk, or he may dine in
courses and wind up with "a little black."
That is not material, except in this, that
he is natural and nil his vices of eating
are his own. They are not imitated vices.
Next to us sat a young man with dreamy
and soulful blue eyes, tbe brow of a poet
and a woman's complexion, upon which
a silken mustache grow witbi ornamental
effect. He smacked his lips over his wine,
which was so distinctly an offense that
the lady from Borneo cared for him no
more until he ate. Ob, for a mirror to be
held in front of that young man. Up and
down, up and down, on the sides of his
nead traveled his ears as he opened and
closed his mouth. Not that the lobes
were attached to his cheeks, for they were
not. His devoted mouth was stretched
to its widest extent He had practiced so
long that his ears bad become sympathetic
and moved with his jaws.
One more instance. We sat at table
while next was a man who took out his
false teeth and wiped them upon his nap
kin.
"T>t me bo," said the Borneoeso lady,
faint y. We went. Catherine.
THE BROWNSTONE MANSION HE IS BUILDING
TT^MILE HAYNE of Los Angeles will
f"^, soon own a brownstono residence.
It will be as entirely the handiwork
of one person as was the storied "house
that Jack built." It will possess an ex
tremely ornate and handsome facade.
Its windows will be great structures, let
ting in floods of sunlight through richly
ornamental panes. The clever chisel of
the sculptor will add (he graces of art to
the architectural beauties. Monument
like it will stand in attestation of an
industrial romance in which arcbiteci,
sculptor, mason, plumber, glazier
and day labor are all typified in
one person, Â«who is Eniile Hayne. Walls
have been slcwly and patiently
raised by one pair of hands. The subtle
ties and refinements and secrets of half a
dozen or more trades Lave been studied
and applied under the unassisted direc
tion of one active brain. Predictions of
failure have been quietly smiied to scorn.
Methods of building which have been con
demned by skilled men have been adopted
in deliance of precedent and have met
with success. A whole town now looks on
wonderingly, admiring where once many
scoffed. Mr. Hayne' n home will be at
220 East Seventeenth street, which is in
ono of the residence districts of Los
Angeles.
The building material which Mr. Hayne
selected involved enormous labor in
handling. The brownstone exterior de
mands an inner wail of brick, to which
the brownatoue must be fastened. Stone
mason, bricumason and blacksmith here
were found in the person of Mr. Hayne.
Huge stone blocks, some of them weighing
ten tons, were to be hoisted from the
ground 10 their appropriate places, and
Mr. Hayne had to raise them to the re
quired level alone and nnaided, for he has
no money with which to employ helpers.
He has successfully become, upon the
pressure of emergency, a mechanical engi
neer, devising a combination of pulleys
and levers which have endowed him
with the power he needed. He has been
compelled in the ea/lier stages of bis work
to omit the flooring which is ordinarily
counted upon to give stability to the
walls, but although rains have beaten
upon the walls and winds have tried to
shake them they remain steadfast and
plumb. Three years ago the work was
begun, which nas been a sufficiently long
period to test the walls under every pos
sible seasonal vicissitude. The weather
has been as powerless to affect tbe walls
as the storms cl criticism and caviling
have been to affect the adamantine pur
pose of the projector, designer and exe
cutor.
Emile Hayne was born in Brussels, Bel
gium, and is 34 years of age. He has been
in this country since 1882. At first he had
a bard time to get along, on account of not
speaking Englisn. But j ossessinp: a fair
education and an aptitude for turning his
hand to anything, it was not long before
he had employment. He rlnally drifted
out to California and is now recognized as
one of tbe most intelligent of the \v rting
men of Los Angeles. When he is at home
he is found in a little two-roomec* build
ing on tbe back of his lot. It is
very modest and is not the kind
of a place in which one would
expect to find such genius. Here he lives
with his wife and two children, and when
at leisure is very agreeable and entertain
ing. He says concerning his enterprise:
"I often wondered if tnere could not be
some way for workingmen to employ
their idle time. One day wnile thinking
of the matter it occurred to me that some
of us might get together and put in such
time in building a bouse, which we would
own in common, each one's share being in
proportion to his work. I decided to pro
pose to some of my friends to build such a
house on my lot, which I had just pur
chased with money that I had saved.
That was three years ago. I was given
some encouragement, and then went to
work and made plans for the building.
When I was ready to commence opera
tions only one man showed up, and he
worked just half a day. They were afraid
that they could not make a success of the
enterprise on account of the building
being of stone and of such a large size. I
was very much disappointed, and I made
up my mind that *the building would go
up if I had to do the work myself.
"I felt that the structure munt be of eood
size and fine appearance to compare with
other dwellings in the neighborhood. I
had but little money and nothing to de
pend upon except what employment I
could get, and my two hands with which
to do the work. I can command, how
ever, pretty good wages, and when I work
as a stone cutter and carver I can earn 50
cents an hour. I worked three months for
my brick, and I have put in the founda
tion and walls 21,000 bricks. Then I went
to Fillmore, Ventura County, and quar
ried my stone from the bed of a creek
where 1 was at liberty to get what I could
free of charge. Il 1 had paid for it, after it
wns quarried, it would have cost me 85
cents a foot. I had to stop at times, and
work for wages, when I could get a job, in
order to keep up with my expenses. I
have made arrangements to pay for the
window-frames and doors, and for the
lumber, with work, and in this way I shall
secure nearly all of my material.
"I have felt discouraged time and time
again. Once i went off in despair and
almost crazy with the thing weighing on
my mind, and I did nothing with it for
five months. The trouble was 1 could not
control myself as Ido now. I would work
all day for wage?, and then when I came
home would look at the brick and stone
aud say to myself: 'There's that work;
it must be done. If you don't do it no
cne else will.' Then I would think: 'Well,
I am pretty tired, but I will just work at
it a few minutes.' However, instead of
doing as I intended I would get rattled
sometimes by a fool or two coming around
in order to tell me that I had a job on my
hands which I never would finish. Then
I would work until 10 or 11 o'clock at
night, using a lantern, and, perhaps,
would start in a?ain at 5 or 6 o'clock in
the ruornioit. As a result I broke down,
and I saw that such a course would not
do, and since thin I have been more de
liberate, working only when out of em
ployment.
"I am bothered more by people than by
anytning else. All sorts of folks come
around and sometimes ask foolish ques
tions. One man wan ted to know if the walls
had been taken from some building and set
up there. Oiher questions have been asked
which were still more foolish. Besides ail
this I am continually told that I can not
do the work, although not so often now
as at first. If you think it is fun to be
pestered as I am just take the job and try
it yourself. lam not so worried as I was;
I have got over my hurry and look at
it as something on which to merely spend
my idle time. Why, if a man did not lay
but a brick a day at the end of ten years
he would find that he had built quite a
house. At the rate 1 am going now in
tbree or four more years the structure will
be completed. Moreover, when the work
is still more advanced, I can raise money
on the property if necessary and quickly
finish it. .
"When I am through with this I shall
organize an association of workingmen,
and we will build houses â not large ones
at first, but small ones. We will put in
our spare time that way, paying for the
material with work and selling the prop
erty for enough to bring us fair wages,
with a small premium. This dwelling
which I am at work on now will have a
capacity of five rooms above and three
very large rooms below, one of which can
be thrown into two. There will be quite
a roomy hallway, a parlor, sitting-foom
and dining-room. The kitchen will be in
the basement, and also a bedroom for
help. The property so far, counting my
work at regular wages and including the
price of tbe lot, has cost me some $5000.
When finished it will be worth $10,000."
This builder, by his determination and
couraee, has turned contempt into ad
miration, and he has now the sympathy
of the entire community. In fact, most
of those who have become acquainted
with the circumstances are as anxious that
he should succeed as be is himself.
Thirteen years ago Egypt was insolvent*
and its securities almost unsalable at one
half or two-thirds their face value, as a
consequence of Ismail's prodigality, while
to-day the country is in a condition which,
comparatively, might be called financial
prosperity.
Tke Queer

Mayor for Alms .â ::
It takes ft policeman, detailed particu
larly for that purpose, and a janitor, one
or the other constantly on guard, to keep
the hordes of people who crowd into the
Mayor's office from opening time until the
office closes for the evening from making
the City's chief executive's life a burden
to him.
Mayor Eilert was easy of access, and
almost any one could walk in through the
anteroom and seek the chief executive,
but with Mayor Sutro it is different. He
is guarded almost as carefully as the Czar
of Russia, and important indeed must be
the business that will secure a personal in
terview or even a hearing before Taylor
Kopers, the Mayor's cierk, who guards the
inner portal. The applicant must first in
terview the guardians of the outer office.
If His business appears to be of importance
and he has nothing of the crank in his
appearance to suggest possible danger
to his Honor, he is permitted to go into
the second chamber, where Mr. Rog
ers or Miss Gibson, the obliging
stenographer, hears his communica
tion and decides whether or not the
Mayor, who is still two doors removed,"
is accessible.
And what a vast variety of things those
visitors want!
There are the hundreds of applicants for
entrance to the Almshouse. with their
pathetic tales of woe, sometimes palpably
false, occasionally queer and olten sad
enough to inspire pity and tears even in
those who listen to such tales until they
become hardened to them. Not more than
a lew days ago an elderly man, who gave
his name as Young H. Roberts, walked in
and asked to be sent to the Almshouse.
The questioning of Mr. Williams broutrht
out the fact that he had arrived from Illi
nois not more than an hour before* and
that his luggage was even then waiting for
him at a downtown hotel. He had
been shipped to California by relatives, he'
said, with his passage paia arid just
enough money to buy his meals en route.
Too feeble to work, he had landed in a
strange city, with no prospect, bat 'starva
tion or the poorhouse before him.
Then there are the constant seekers after
alms, some persevering and many not. One
of the most deservine of these for a long
'time was Bridget McGonigle: who haunted
the office until finally told that if she
would bring a certificate of character from
some business man she would be assisted.
Bridget's search for a recommendation
was apparently an arduous one, for she
was conspicuous by her absenca for some
time.
Then one day she returned triumphantly,
waving a crumpled and battered bit of
â¢paper which she thrust into Mr. Williams'
band, with the remark:
"There's me character."
The document read abont as follows:
This is to certify 'that I have known the
bearer, Bridget McGonigle, fot the past ten
years, and known her to be a deserving woman
and worthy of aid. She is one of my best cus
tomers. Michael Casey.
"Who is Michael Casey," asked Mr.
Williams, whose suspicions bad been
aroused by the writing and general ap
pearance of the letter of recommendation.
"Oh, he's a friend of mine, and a good,
square business man," answered Bridget
volubly, gi ving also his address.
Mr. Williams looked up Michael Casey
at the number mentioned, and found that
he conducted a 5-cent beer saloon. Bridget
got no alms.
Then there am many who think that
the Mayor controls the entire City gov

The inventors who want to see the Mayor

ARE SERVANTS
FOR AN HOUR
Curious Way Some
Women Work
HoW My Lady in Straitened Gir
cumstances J^akes a ShoW
ing Before Quests
There are some people in this City that
at some time in the past have been in
better circumstances who still have a pride
i in keeping up appearances despite the fact
j that they are not able to keep house as
j they did in the days that have gone never
to return; all by reason of a reduced in- I
come. And tbe way this is done is through
a class of willing, accommodating women
who in that way make a living and at the
L same time help carry out the deception
! that is practiced on visiting friends.
It is an innocent deception that does
not hurt any one. One of the first curtail
ments in a home where the income is
' c'.irainished is the cutting off of the servant
or servants and the hiring of a woman for
one day in the week to do the rough work.
This woman is set to wash the front steps
and clean the front windows, and that goes
to create the impression among the neigh
bors and with friends if they should be
passing the house that there is at least
one servant in the house, and the balance
of the week the lady of the house is forced
to do her own work.
Whenever the lady of the house wishes
to entertain it is then that the accommo
dating woman comes so handy. Her rates j
vary from 25 to 50 cents an hour, and she I
takes the place of the dismissed servant,
attends to the cooking with the assistance
of the lady of the house, who occasionally
has to excuse herself to her company, say
ing: "I have got a new girl and must step
out for a moment to see that she does not
spoil the dinner.' ' During her absence the
company utter words of sympathy for the
"poor, dear soul" who has so much
trouble with her help.
The clever housekeeper who is forced to
resort to this tricK to keep up appearances !
manages, by a shrewdness that is born of
necessity, to lead her friends into the be
lief that she is keeping house in the old
fashioned way, and if they are ignorant of
the true state of affairs why make them
wise \n a matter that does not concern
them?
Dinner is served by the "new girl," the
kitchen tidied, and then the accommodat
ing woman receives her pay for so many
hours' work and she is discharged nntil
wanted again.
"Yes," said one of the accommodating
women, "there is enough of that kind of
work to keep rue occupied almost every
day in the week, and as things are going

I'm engaged for only one hour I charge 50

charge 40 cents an hour, and if it is more

HE IS KIND
TO STRANGERS
AJMan of Linguistic At
tainments
Earns His Bread by Quiding the
Tourist to the Sights of
San Francisco
Any one who enters the reading-room J
and office of one of the large hotels on
Montgomery street can almost at any time
see a dapper little man holding down
chair No. lon the first row. His favorite
attitude is sitting with bis legs crossed,
| his right elbow resting on the arm of the \
chair and his head resting on the palm of j
his hand. His complexion is dark, he
looks like a Spaniard, and he might be
mistaken for some Spanish general on
furlough, meditating on the possible out
come of the war in Cuba.
"No; he's no general," was the reply of
the hotel clerk to an individual with an
inquisitive turn of mind. "He's only a j
man who takes parties over the City and
shows them all the sights except China
town ; that he leaves to others better
posted in the quarter than he is.
"Yes, he does look 'a little sleepy, and,
as the French say, 'fatty gay,' but that's
his normal condition. Guess he was born
weary, but for all that he's as smart as a
steel trap. He makes his living as no
other man does in this City. He speaks
English, French, German and Spanish
fluently; is posted on European and
American affairs. He can discuss the sil
ver question and talk about the war in
Cuba and the late revolution among the
Uitlanders with just as much ease as
though he had been a diplomat all his life,
and he knows the City like a book. There
is not a prominent house in the City that
be does not knew, and he knows the occu
pants by name, if not personally. And it
is that knowledge that makes his services
valuable.
"Whenever strangers come to the hotel,
particularly those who are from France,
Germany or Spanish-speaking countries,
he rouses himself and prepares for busi
ness. He makes himself known, and then
offers his services to show them the sights
of the metropolis of the Pacific. Many
who are mere globe-trotters take advantage
of his offer, and for a consideration he
shows them around and takes them to the
stores to make purchases. Now as he has
an eye to the dollar he does not fail to take
them to those places where the old system
of 'addition, division and silence* is in
vogue. And that brings him in a pretty
penny every time he goes out.
"As I said before it is a novel way to
earn a living, but it is one of the ways,
and there is no reason why he should not
encage in it if it pleases and pays him.
He has, so far as I know, a monopoly of
the business, for I do not know of any
other hotel that has such an individual
among the loungers in the reading-room
or office."
The gentleman of linguistic gift when
approached, in the most Chesterfieldan
manner declined to be interviewed as to
his business and what there is in it for
him, but he was exceedingly loquacious as
to what he could do for any one who
wished to engage his services at so much a
day or portion of a day.
"Life," said the sententious young man, "is
like a game of cards."
"It is more like & game of chess to me," said
the man who lives in apartments. "I move
once a year."

Discreet and K : ndly Women Who
Care for the Wardrobes of
Single J^en
"Mending of gentlemen's clothes and
garments taken care of," is what . appears j
on a small sign that modestly projects !
a few inches from a house on an alley j
leading from Post street.
In answer to a knock at the door near
which thu \ sign is â¢ nailed, a middle-aged
woman appears and explains that she is
the one who does the mending.
"You see," she said, "there are many
young men in this City who have apart
ments but no one to look after what they
have in them. There are many of them
who miss a loving mother or a willing
sister ready to mend a tear here, sew a
button on there or darn a sock with a
small hole. There are many young men
who are not so proud but they will wear
mended garments, and it is with that
class I deal. Some bring the articles they
want mended to my house and call for
them, and these ' I charge by the piece.
Others have me go to their rooms during
their absence and look over their ward
robes and do what is necessary for them.
In such places I am paid by the month.
I do the repairing and keep their clothing
in order for $1 50 a month.
"If there is a tear or a rip in a coat I put
in the necessary stitch in time the proverb
says saves nine. I look after their cloth
ing and do for them what a mother would
do for a son,
"Well, yes, I sometimes come across
some secrets that it would not do for the
world to know; but if I do find out some
thing I have sense enough to keep my dis
covery to myself. To be sure every young
man has a right to have a girl, and if ; he
has, whose business is it? If ne receives
a love letter from her and leaves it in his
coat pocket, is there any harm if I should
glance at it so long as I do not tell what I
read? ;
â¢; "I was a girl myself once and I used to
write letters, and my only curiosity is -, to
see if the girls of to-day write about as
much nonsense as we girls did. I can tell
you this just quietlyâ they do. It seems
to me that love never ; grows old ' and that
though fashions come ( and fashions go â¢
there is no change of fashion in the mat
ter or love. I really do believe that if we
could see one of Mother Eve's love letters
it would be found to contain as much non
sense as can 'be found to-day in the scrib
blings of the young new woman."
The . speaker said that there are quite a
number of women who, not able to follow'
any other occupation, have adopted ) this
repairing I business as a means of earning
a living for themselves,' and ;in many in- .
stances their I families of little children,
who '' are un able to render . any assistance.
They do not get rich, but it is sufficient to
enable them to live quite comfortably. :'" 7

There are many peculiar ways of hon
estly making a living, but possibly the
most peculiar is obtaining a living, may
be just a living, by collecting food for
birds.
The writer, calling at the house of a
lady, was interrupted in a conversation by
a ring of the doorbell, and a moment after
the servant opened the parlor door to an
nounce that it was "the old woman with
the chickweed."
"You'll excuse me till I see this old lady
and get some weed for my canaries," said
the lady as she passed out into the hall.
The door being open one could not help
seeing an elderly woman with silver-gray
hair, with a basket in her hand, pass over
to tbe lady of the house a big bunch of
fresh, green weed that the yellow song
sters love so well.
"Some kind neighbor who thinks of
your canaries?" was suggested when the
lady returned to the parlor.
"No," was the reply, "that is the old
lady's business.
"What â selling chickweed?"
"Why, yes; did you never hear of her?
No? Why, that's strange. I thought
everybody knew her. The old lady has
been at it for years. She is now 68 years
of age and that is the way she earns a
living for herself. She has a great num
ber of customers and to each she furnishes
twice a week a handful of chickweed for
the birds for 5 cents a week or 20 cents a
month. There are a great many who not
only give what she asks, but press an
extra quarter in her hand when they pay
her.
"I believe that she manages to make a
very fair living in that way. Every morn
ing she eoes out â 1 do not know where,
and gathers a basketful of weed, and then
distributes it, taking in a certain district
one day and another the next, and so on
until she has supplied all of her customers.
â¢â¢The old lady has always been a bird
fancier, and she knows as much about
them as a bird-dealer. If there is any
thing the matter with your bird tell her
about it when she comes around and she
will give a remedy. And her remedy
always works well. I really believe that
it is as much for the knowledge she im
parts as it is for the weed she sells that
she has such a large run of customers."
She was at one time the wife of a local
merchant, who left her a widow with but
a few thousand dollars, but that was not
to last for all time, and, economical a3 she
was, the constant drain upon the princi
pal reduced it so low that she had to do
something: but, being too old to take any
tning that would tax her strength, she de
termined upon procuring food for the
birds, and in that way food for nerself.
This seems to show that no matter how
small the undertaking is it will succeed if
pushed.
A party of tourists were examining one
of the large trees of California. One of the
party remarked:
"What a magnificent specimen ! Surely
it must be the oldest tree in the world !"
An Irishman who was with the party
cried out:
"Now. faith, how could that be?" and
burst out into laughter. "Sure any one
knows this is a new country, and how the
mischief could the tree be ould?"

Young jAz^ of Qood Address Who
JhemselVes Out to Jrip
the Fantastic
A few evenings since a fraternal- society
man had occasion to attend an open in
stallation of the officers of a lodge, and as
it had been given out that there would be
a dance after the ceremony there' were
present a great many of the fair sex. It
was, in fact, soon noticed that tbe attend
ance of men and women was. like tbe.
demo-populo campaign sign, 16' to 1,
and that the women represented the sil
ver.
"Don't see much show for dancing," re
marked the fraternal society man, "with
so many women and so few cien," ad
dressing himself to the floor manager.
"That will be all right; wait till you get
into the dance hall and the (lancers will be
on a parity, because, you know, there are
a good many ladies whose dancing days
are over, and they serve to ornament the
side chairs."
In tbe dancing-hall some time after the
fraternal society man saw that the floor
manager had predicted correctly. There
was about an equal number of tbe sexes
for dancing and it was noticeable that
many of the young men who moved their
partners around the waxed floor to the
soft, sweet melody of the "New Bully," i
waltz time, were in full-dress and seemed
to be most agreeable partners, well versed
in ballroom etiquette.
Recognizing one of the male dancers in
clawhammer and fashionable tie, the fra
ternal society man accosted him with:
"Why, what are you doing here? I did not
know that you were a Knight of the High
Flying Falcon."
"Well, I am not, but just came up to
have a pleasant time with the girls, you
know ; so enjoyable to have a good dance. "
The following night the fraternal society
man visited another fraternal organiza
tion that had announced a social and was
somewhat astonished to see on the floor
the very same set of young men, in swal
low-tail coats, mat he had observed at the
dance of the Knights of the High Flying
Falcons.
Again addressing the one be had spoken
to the evening previous he said, "Charlie,
isn't this rushing things? Who are ail
these young men?"
"I don't mind telling you," was the an
swer. "We are a lot of young men of
good family, but not overburdened with
wealth, and therefore not averse to
making a few dollars on the quiet. As
you must know, there are so many of
these parties given every ni^ht In the
week that those who were in the habit of
attending have got tired and they prefer
to go to 'smokers,' free and easy, you
know, so we saw a chance to supply the
deficiency in the male line by hiring our
selves out at so much a nignt to supply
partners for the lady visitors. The ladies,
Lord love them, at parties like this one
don't ask any questions; they want
to c*ance and they want dancers, so we
supply the demand, and in that way we
keep ourselves in spending money. Not a
bad scheme, eh?" and with that he sought
his partner for the next dance.

It was a native of the Old Sod who,
whea asked why he boiled his potatoes in.
his hat instead of in a pot, replied, "I
have n,o pot, and necessity is the mother
of invention." And it is necessity that
forces many people to invent ways to earn
money. There is in this City a young
lady who has become, like many more,
the victim of circumstances. ., A few years
ago, when speculation in mining shares
had a, hold on our people, her father was
one of the wildest and most reckless and
at the same time most fortunate specula
tors on the street. For a time he was like
Midas, his magic touch turned everything
to gold, everything came his way, and it
was the rule for speculators to buy when
Bill Mountain bought and sell when he
let go.
His home. was the finest in the aristo
cratic quarter and his entertainments
were as lavish as* they were freely given to
those who were welcome guests within
his doors. There was not a thing that the
members of his- family wanted that was
not procured, asd there was no lack of
friends ready to welcome the members of
Bill Mountain's family. It was with him
as with many others, eaay come, easy
gone, and. there was not a precaution
taken for a possible reversal of fortune.,
The turn did come, and when it did his
fortune slipped from him with a rapidity
that, was beyond the power of staying.
So great was the change, thai the cry on
the street was altered to "When Bill
Mountain buys, sell; when he sells, buy."
He -became a financial wreck. Do what*
he could he could not regain his lormer
position. .He lost heart and became a phy
sical wreck. The little that was saved
from the crumbling fortune soon dwindled
away and there was none but his daughter
to take heart to matte a living for the fam
ily. She is a remarkably fine musician,
plays the violin with a touch equaled only
by that of Camilla Urso. and often in the
days of her prosperity did she charm at
home or at the homes of friends those who
assembled there, with selections from the
great masters. . â¢â
To-day she still charms circles where she
is yet reoeived as friend, but every.
note she sounds is paid for, and
it Is by that means she makes a
living for herself and those who
are dependent upon her. So great is her
talent that she is sought after constantly,
and everywhere she is introduced not as
a professional but as a guest, and plays
her part as such with as much grace as
she does the instrument which keeps her*
and hers alive. But while there is a smile
on her lips there is often a pang in her
heart at the thought of the way in which
she has to masquerade in order to make
both ends meet.
While that is one of the strange ways to
make a living, it is a creditable one, and
the once society girl, who feels that she
no longer has the right to that distinction, '
is to be commended for having had the
courage to turn to useful account the tal
ent that was developed in her when she
was in position to have the training re
quired. _^____^_^___

GOSSIP FRO M NEW YORK,
NEWSY THINGS AND PERSONAL MENTION OF
CALIFORNIANS IN GOTHAM'S
TORRID ZONE
NEW YORK, N. V., July ?6.-The ter
rible humidity that seems to- have settLed
down on New York for good has .stag-.
nated society and, stampeded those who
might have been headed this way. Ti ere
has been a continued and oppressive heat
heTe for the last fortnight, interrupted by
sbowers, followed by a still heavier and.
torpid atmospheie. People go around the
streets mopping their faces and cursing in
undertones. There is not enoQgh anima
. tion in a 'single inhabitant to justify
demonstrative profanity. . .
Day before yesterday I saw Tommy
Leary of the Tivoii .company standing in
the middle of the Courthouse square, and
the expression on his face indicated that
he was looking for. an ice-wagon to come
along, so he could mob it. Mr. Leary has
for long years suffered from an overdose'
of fat, and here he finds- it more incon
venient to carry .than ill Sail Francisco,
where aft occasional breeze gives tem
porary jrelief: . * â¢
He tried to. exhibit himself \n his very
â¢/"â¢best Â«long Theatrical Row, but a smooth
stiff collar of the- morning's vintage caved
. â¢â¢ in qn him before noon, and about 1 p. m.
.he w.as stretched- out in Madison,- square
' . ; Park fanning himself listlessly with a wet
handkerchief and , expressing the wish"
that he -was on' a tugt>oat with Ferris'
â¢ Hartman.or else'down io the basement of
*. .the' -Louvre. Really, I never saw Mr.
â¢ â¢ Leary so. very, very tired of the' day. j
â¢;.â¢â¢ -When evening comes Thomas heads for a j
â¢"_ â¢â¢â¢/roof garden adorned in.a neglige shirt and J
a pair of duck trousers.. He is not certain
just how long he will stay heje, but if the
. .humidity continues he will probably take i
a round-the-Horn steamer and come bacK
to San Francisco vja the Antartfc Ocean.
. Hugo Schlamm-of the firm of Broder &'
ScblanS'm, San Francisco music publishers,
came here with Mr. Leary, but being a
â¢ much th.inner and more passive man,- he
managed to get alotTg first rate. The only
discomfort he luffers is the necessity of
' tearing Leary's remarks about thechm.ate.
He : says he knows no one quite so descrip^
â¢â¢ "tive in his abuses of a section &s the gen
tleman from the Tivoii.
Mr. Schlamm is here in the interests of
his San -Francisco house and intende to
open a branch in' New York. He will, be
Lere perhaps a week or two and return by
way of Boston and Chicago. He has gath
ered a considerable quantity of- new music,
â¢.. -Doth local 'and foreign, and will. lay it be
fore San Franciscans on- his return trip.
W. W, Fobte is at the Fifth-avenue Ho
tel, where he wili "be until certain matters
pertainiiig to the Cravfcn will case are set
fled. There appears to be a New York
end to that celebrated case, and Mr. Foote
has the matter in charge. He has a wide
"circle Â»f acquaintance here, and will, in
all probability, visit his friend Grover
CJevgland at Washington. Mr. Foote and j
the Presfdent liave on an occasion before |
phar*ed the same bait at Buzzards Bay. I
â¢ Unless the iife-saving Democracy re
nominate Mr. Cleveland he will have con
siderable time to devote to the Pacific
coaster. He may be inclined to do it any
how., Â«He has never been known to Jet the
business pf the Nation interfere with his
fishing and his friends.
â I F. L. H. Noble, formerly of the San
i Francisco Examiner, arrived here the first
\ of the week to renew his journalistic asso
i ciation with the Journal. George Byon,
j who came here as an artist, intends re-
J turning to the coast as soon as possible,
| finding the climate here. very unsatisfac
tory.
Since the yachting season has opened at
j Larchmont Mr. Harry Gillig, the Crockers.
j. the Haffs and other San Franciscans spend
considerable time on the water. Mr.
Frank Unger never overlooks San Fran
ciscans, and Larchmont is always open to
I people from the Bay City. None of the
â¢ New York club have forgotten Uncle
| George Bromley on his last trip to this
point ; and they always inquire after him
wfth feeling. Uncle George made a good
impression here by being the first on the
ground and the last to depart. There was
never a single instance, when he was in the
stragglers' ranks, and his general behavior
among the ladies who bad the pleasure of
meeting him is on a par with that of the
late lamented Lord Chesterfield.
I met Steve Brodie yesterday, that cele
brated New York citizen who falls off
â¢ Brooklyn bridge whenever he wants to at
' tract attention.
"I am goin' out to Frisco in August
wid my show," said Mr. Brodie. "You
j know dat play of mine, 'On de
j Bowery.' Why, say, all de scenery
j what I have fig'red in is in de i
play. Me saloon, inside and out, and de
bridge, and everyting has red fire on de
i side. Dose blokes in Frisco will have a tit
when I rings up de curtain. Dats what.
"After de matinee some day I am goin'
â¢ to swim from de Cliff House to the seal
rocks, ana engage wid Ben Butler, de boss
seal, in a rougti and tumble fracas."
I offered the information that Ben But
ler was dead.
"Don't niak* no difference. I'll go up
against any one of dem. Now dat goes.
See?"
Mr. Brodie is really going to San
Francisco, but regarding his movements ;
with the descendants of the late Ben Butler j
I am unabie to give any definite informa
tion.
Mr. R. A. Irving, ex-secretary of the
â¢ Horse Show Association of San Francisco,
! is at the Stuart House still, and has inter
ested himself in some California mining
deals, which he anticipates will pan out
! well.
Hotel men are watching the HoDart
Estate Company with great interest. Since
they indicated their intention of putting
up the finest hotel in New York at the cor
ner of Broadway and Thirty-seventh street,
there has been no end of conjecture as to
who will come out best in the race between
the Hobart combination and Mr. Astor's
Waldorf Hotel. It is a recognized fact here
that when California capital comes into
business channels something has got to
come up to a high standard to meet it.

Cavendish, Trist, Whitfield, and our whist I
queen, Miss Kate Wheelock, sitting at the
same table playing the game we all love so
well, was a tre at never to be forgotten. In j
our childhood days we used to hear of
"Cavendish," in later years we read of hlm>
and every word in bis many works on the
game, for severaryears we have been in cor
respondence with him, but not until the
sixth congress did we enjoy the long-looked
for moment of meeting him face to face.- A
few years ago he sent us a life-size photo of
himself, which adorns the walls of the Trist
Club rooms of this City. To us he was a large
broad-shouldered man, about 6 feet 3, in j
weight about 225 pounds, stern and gruff,
and if the time ever came when we could look
at him, play a rubber of whist with him or
take him by the hand and give it a warm grasp
of welcome that time would be the supreme
moment in our whist life. This pleasure we
anticipated so many years came at last, and
with it disappointment.
Mr. Henry Jones "Cavendish" is about 5 feet
6 inches in height, weighs about 155 pounds,
a little stooped when he walks, wears a full
beard and combs his hair well back irom his
large forehead, as his pictures always repre
sent him. Ho made a great sacrifice to attend
this congress. His health was such he should
never have crossed the Atlantic, but he says he
â¢ felt as we did that he would attend this con
gress if he had to be carried on a stretcher. He
returned home on the Lucania, which left
New York on July 4. We had the pleasure of
spending several days and evenings with him,
one of them in his pleasant parlors in the
Montauk Club, Brooklyn, the night before he
went down to the Oriental, where the congress
was to be held. In getting his "luggage" ready,
as sick as he was, he would break out with
something that would cause lots of merriment,
One of his remarks to Weems: "What an idiot
my dear wife must be. What do you think she
put into my luggage? Forty-two shirts and
enough collars, cuffs and handkerchiefs and
stockings to furnish a regiment, just as though
there was not a laundry in this blarsted coun
try." The master is a great conversationist,
many years retired from the practice of medi
cine and surgery, and has all of the "needful"
to spend the rest of his days in luxury and
comfort, surrounded by his whist friends.
N. B. Trist comes from New Orleans. He is
the "father of American leads." All whist
players in America know of him, but to talk
with him, to see him, to play whiÂ«t with himâ
why, you want to get up and throw your arms
around him and hug him. One can't help but
love him. At the congress he was the center
of every group. All eyes were upon him at all
times. Whenever he sat down to play the
table would be immediately surrounded.
When Mr. Trist arrived at the Oriental on
Sunday eveningâ just at the dinner-hourâ he
was soon escorted into the dining-room, and in
a moment the hundreds who were seated arose
to their feet and stood cheering and clapping
their hands lor several minutes. He needed
no introduction.
Two life-size portraits of him adora the
walls of the Trist Club rooms of this City, one
of them sent to the club by the New Orleans
Chess and Whist Club, Mr. Trist being one of
its founders; the other donated by the janitor.
It is stranee but true that Mr. Trist has never
written a book on the panic, but has contrib
uted enough to whist literature to fiil a dozen.
One of his last articles appeared in Harper's
Weekly July 1. Knowing Mr. Trist as well as
we do, a most intimate acquaintance he would
have us say, if we said anything, that the
fads that the whist wind is blowing around
the country find no favor with him. The
leads end follows, the discards and echoes have
never changed, and so far he sees no reason
why they should. Thu calling for trumps
iv the original lead through an honor turned,
with all sorts of irregular leads, is not worthy
of any notice, and loses two tricks when it can
possibly make one. The Call will soon pub
lish something quite interesting from him.

WHIST
Having had the honor of visiting Mr. Trist st
his own home, it is our pleasure to say he has
a charming familyâ wife and five daughters.
Miss Rosella is a teacher of whist of wonder
ful ability. Is it at all strange? The name of
Mr. Trlst will go down into history as the
greatest writer on the game that ever lived,
and we hope some day that he will see tde
error of bis way and write a book.
TRIST ON WHIST.
Professor W. H. Whitfeld came to this coun
try from England to attend the congress. His
wonderful problems have put him to the front
rank in the game. He is a young man about
42, Drofessor of mathematics at Cambridge.
We published several of his problems, and
generally they cannot be solved by ore in a
hundred. The fourth one of the quartet, our
whist queen, Miss Wheelock, ban Francisco
whisters all know. Nothing that we can say
will add luster to her crown. If the "Women
In Whist" patterned after her no whist clubs
in America weuld object to having lady mem
bers. At the Brooklyn Congress she was the
queen. Our whist editor had cnarge of all the
tournaments in which she played, and 100
times at least we were asked to point out
America's whist queen. One of the happiest
and most enjoyable events at this meeting was
the dinner given by her majesty to her royal
subjects. It was given in the honor of Trist
and Caveudish.
ECHOES FROM THE CONGRESS.
Several deals that were played hy Cavendish,
Trist and Whitfeldâ the first they ever played
togetherâ and the Identical cards will be put
Into play at the Trist Club rooms the first
week in September, when the fall play begins,
and the one having the highest score for the
month will be given one of the packs, with an
autograph of each of the trio.
NO MORE CHIPS USED IN COUNTING.
There was not a chip (usually used in count
ing tricks) seen at the congress during the
entire week's play.
FIVE NEW DIRECTORS ELECTED.
Five directors, whose term of office expired
with this congress, retired from the board and
John T. Mitchell of Chicago, Clarence A. Hen
riques of New York, Thomas Whelan of Balti
more and J. E. Shwab of Nashville were se
lected to fill the vacancies. Mr. Otis of Jereey
City was elected for oue year.
SHORT SUITS Va LONG SUITS.
There were several 'â¢short-suit" teams at the
congress, but they were knocked out in the
first round, as was expected. The whist editor
of the New York Sun claims the New York
Whist Club played short suits, but the whist
editor of The Call has a written statement
from Colonel E. A. Buffiugton, the best player
on the team, stating that he never led a short
suit onqe during the entire match. This state
ment was signed in the presence of G. L. Bunn,
captain St. Paul team, and John H. Briggs,
the wnist king.
AMERICAN LEAGUE SYSTEM OF PLAY.
One of the delegates to congress from the
Trist Duplicate Whist Club of this City offered
the following resolution, which was unani
mously carried:
Resolved, That the president of the league be
instructed to appoint an advisory committee to
consider the advisability of appointing a stand
ing committee to sift the different methods of play,
etc., and recommend one that, seems to be the
best for adoption by ihe league.
Every night during the congress the man
ager of Pain's fireworks establishment, nearly
opposite the hotel, had special designs made
for the benefit of the whist players and those
in attendance at the congress. One piece,
twenty ieet square, emblem of the American
Whist League, another the Hamilton Trophy,
another N. B. Trist, another the president-elect
of the league, Walter H. Barney; but the one
that struck us as a greater novelty than the
rest was one of those immense bombs that is
thrown into the heavens, then bursting, a
thousand and one colors appear to come forth

WHIST RECEPTION.
The San Francisco Whist Club gave a recep
tion lasi Monday evening, at the clubrooms, to
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Payot, who had just re
turned from a year's trip around the world.
Mr. Payot was one of the founders of the San
Francisco Whist Club and its first president.
All whist players on the coast will welcome
him home again. Mr. and Mrs. Payot at
tended the whist congress at Manhattan
Beach. In the midst of a group of at least
twenty whisters one evening, out on the broad
piazza of the Oriental Hotel, facing the ocean,
Mr. Payot, in nis usual merry way, called "At
tention for a moment." All listened. He said,
"I just heard the wild waves inquire, 'What's
trumps?' " <
The double dummy problem published July
19 was an easy oneâ in fact, it was not a prob
lem at all, as there are several ways in which
North and South can take all the tricks. Our
object in publishing it was to see if our read
ers were interested in the problems published
in The Call and to see how many replies
would be received. In all there were sixty-one
answers, all but seven of which were correct.
The prize offeredâ a copy of "Whist of To
day"âis awarded to Miss Jennie Partridge,
3128 Twenty-first street, San Francisco, whose
solution and notes were the most complete
and satisfactory.
The following twenty-four deserve mention
for tne care taken with their solutions: James

MASONRY AND WISDOM
THE ARCANE MYSTERIES TO BE TAtJGHT IN
A LATTER-DAY COLLEGE IN
THIS COUNTRY- .'
Mention was made in The Call some
weeks since of a college of occultism to be
known as the School for the Revival of the
Lost Mysteries of Antiquity. It was
stated that the site was to. be dedicated
early in 1997, and as soon thereafter as
possible active arrangments would be
made to carry out the plans in detail.
The promoters of this college are promi
nent business men of America and Europe.
But back of them, it is said, are those who
are the custodians of the arcane truths.
which were so jealously guarded in the
great mysteries of Egypt, Greece .and
India before the Christian era. These
adepts, it is claimed, are now ready to
again give to humanity this ancient
knowledge. They say that the world is on
the eve of a mighty forward step, and that
as America is the great nation of the future
so she will also be the center from which
the old teachings shall again be dissemi
nated to the world.
If but a f raciion of what is claimed for
this movement be true it is still one of the
most remarkable that has been brought to
the notice of mankind in this age of mar
velous scientific advance, and the results
which are so confidently asserted must be
far-reaching in the way of good for human
kind.
The preliminary organization of the
School for the Revival of the Lost Mys
teries has just been completed, and the
school fund committee has issued the fol
lowing self-explanatory ad-dress from its
headquarters at 144 Madison avenue, New
York :
Plato and Pythagoras derived their know
ledge through initiation into the Mysteries.
The knowledge which they thus derived ex
isted long before their time, and served also
for the establishment of the Schools of the
Magi. This knowledge reached us by way of
Egypt and Chaldea. It was the combined re
sult of millenniums of research into the rrfys
teries of nature by wise men, trained adepts,
who by self-conquest and evolution had ad
vanced to higher planes and tested their
knowledge by actual experience. Not only has
most of the wisdom thus acquired become lost
to the outer world, Dut the very method by
which it was obtained is now practically un
known, so that very few persons in this age be
lieve that either such a wisdom or the process
of its attainment ever existed. This knowledge
was never revealed to the profane, for it gave
immense power lor either good or evil to its
possessors. It was recorded in symDOl, para
ble and allegory, requiring a key for its inter
pretation.
Two new agents have now come forward to
found a School of Learning for the purpose
of restoring to the world a knowledge of the
nature of Ihe soul and the methods of its
higher evolution, and for the more complete
and systematic training of neophites quali
fied by actual attainment for advancement
into the Greater Mysteries. Those obtaining
this deeper knowledge will become teachers
and leaders of the human race, consecrated
to its service.
The sym bols and ceremonies of Free Masonry
were originally derived from the more ancient
mysteries, as all who have "traveled the burn
ing sands" know. The ritual aud ceremonies,
signs and pass-words have been preserved with
great fidelity, but the real key has long b?eu
lost waiting for-'future generations" to dis
cover it.
True Masonry and ancient wisdom are virtu
> ally the same*. Â£ach is founded on the brother
hood- of man. The^lost key and the-true r^hii
osophy.can be found and will be placed witty â 
the reach of all thnse who unselfishly desir*
and work for their possession. Masonry *bj
glyph and ceremony dramatically represen,ti
.the progress of the neophyte in the degrees o:
his initiation. It Is only by the union of th<
speculative and the operative, or the philo
sophical and ttie symbolic or actual that th<
real meaning and intent eff either can b<
realized, the "master's word*" recovered and
the ancient glory be restored. Such a result
has now become possible under cyclic lew
The masters are ready and' have issued thcii
orders. It remains lor -us to take notice there*
of and accept. tHeir offer of help. This ig i
privilege that has net come- to mankind .dun
ing many a weary millennium of ignorance and
â¢strife.'
Those who feel the sore need and appreciati
the opportunity will respond gladly, and il
has already been demonstrated that the great
work will be done.. No return is promised, ta
individual subscribers. The school must not
only be built but .endowed, in order to secura
| its efficiency and permanency. That the time
is ripe for the establishing of the school is
fully prov.ed by the 'spontaneous subscription
of $10,600 in cash and $15,000 in archi
tectural, engineering, electrical 'and other
work, at New York, on A*pril 26 and 27, in
response to a public call made for this pur
pose. .
A board of trustees Has been formed to take
this work in hand. The board is supplemented
by an "advisory council,' 1 the latter to bÂ« itÂ»
creased ai others "worthy and well | quali
fied" are found.
From their number the trustees have ap
pointed a ."school fund" committee, whose
special duty it is to raise money. .
Geographical- divisions have -been estab
lished, each under the direct supervision of
a member of .the "school lund" committee,
who appoint agents in each locality; these
agents to be furnished with authorized sub
scription books' and Io solicit subscriptions in
their respective communities and make
monthly reports and returns to their division
chief, who makes liTte returns and reports % to
the treasurer in J^ew York. In this way the
country will be quickly covered by earnest
workers and all who "love humanity" given
an opportunity to 'imitate the sfJlendid exam
ple already set and thus help forward the work
of quickly establishing this "great school."

The Los Angeles Times has issued, an

â¢'A' McKinley Number."in which is pub
lished a- large amount of information con-
Â«ernin(? the St. Louis convention, its nom

taxes. In other words they claim that
tax-shirking is strictly philanthropy, and
being so ought to be entirely voluntary as
to the., extent to which the philanthropy
:s carried. '
The action of the Republicans of the
'Fifth Dhstrict virtually assures the suc
cess of the party there. Claus Spreckels
lor Presidential elector will strengthen the
ticket throughout the State, for he is
known to be one of the men who has done
most to develop its resources and provide
work and wages for industrious men;
while the selection of Mr. Loud for Con
gress was wisely made, as be has been a
faithful and able Representative In the past
and proven himself in every way worthy
of the confidence and tue honor of the
people.
THE FIFTH DISTRICT.
The action taken by the Republican
Convention of the Fifth Congressional
District will be read with gratification by
Republicans in all parts of California.
The nomination of Claus Spreckels for
Presidential elector will strengthen the
ticket all over the State, while the nomi
nation of Mr. Loud for Congress assures to
the people of the district the continued
service at Washington of a representative
who takes rank among the foremost of th 6
younger leaders of the House and has
there a prestige and an influence which
will be of great value to the State.
It is significant of the importance of this
campaign to the business interests of tne
community that a man like Mr. Spreckels
accepts a part in the contest as a candi
date for Presidential elector. Mr. Spreck
els has no time to expend in seeking idle
honors. His energies ara occupied in the
conduct of great industrial affairs, and be
would not devote any of them to politics
were not the issues of the campaign so
momentous as to make it imperative that
every man of business and every good
citizen should do all in his power to save
the people and the Republic from the con
sequences that would be sure to follow
from the success of the Democratic party
and the election of Bryan on the Chicago
platform.
As Mr. Spreckels is at this time the
foremost promoter of the industries of
California it is most appropriate that he
should take a leading place in the contest
for patriotism, protection and prosperity.
Every workingman in California knows
that Mr. Spreckels is employing his capital
and bis energies to mate work and wages
for the unemployed. Every farmer knows
that he is devoting himself largely to the
important work of developing the sugar
industry of the State that will give profits
to farmers as well as wages for working
men. Every producer of the San Joaquin
and every shipper of freight to or from
that valley knows what he is doing to
break down the power of the monopoly
and to make transportation freer for the
benefit of all. His record as a promoter of
industry, as well as his reputation for
business sagacity and stainless integrity,
will enable him to exert a powerful influ
ence during the election, and he renders
an important service to both the State and
the Nation in exerting that influence on
the side of financial honor and industrial
prosperity.
Mr. Loud obtained his renomination by
virtue of the fidelity and the ability with
which he has served his constituents.
Elected for his first term against so strong
and popular a Democrat as General Clunie,
Mr. Loud has strengthened his Hold on
the minds and hearts of his constituents
year after year until he is to-day the
strongest candidate that could have been
possibly nominated in that district. His
re-election may be safely regarded as a
foregone conclusion, as the voters of the
Fifth are too intelligent to throw aside the
service of a well-tried representative for
the purpose of electing such a man as the
Democrats have nominated against him.
It is no exaggeration to say that all Cal
ifornia is interested in Mr. Loud's re-elec
tion. He has now risen in Congress to a
position which entitles him to the chair
.manship of an important committee, and
was appointed to such a chairmanship in
this Congress by Speaker Reed. He has
therefore influence enousrh to be helpful
to the whole State, whereas a new man
could hardly do much even for his own
district. The people of the Fifth wijf not
overlook that fact, and we count on Mr.
Loud's re-election by a majority that his
intends may be proud of.
TAX-SHIERING SOPHISTRY.
The tax-shirking corporations urge in
defense of their sbiricing that if they pay
their full taxes they will have to raise the
rate 1 of their puolic charges. To increase
. the assessment of the water company foi
taxation we are told is in fact to increase
the water rates that the people must pay.
To increase the assessment of the railway
company is to increase the lares of passen
ger travel. In short the public is assured
that to tax a corporation is to tax itself,
and therefore' the corporation that shirks
taxes is a public benefactor and a frve
philanthropist.
To this amusing sophistry the answer is
easy. We say to .the water company : Fix
your property valuation as you please,
eithfcr at $23,000,000 as you say it Is worth
when fixing water, rates, or 53,000,000 as
you. say it is when taxes are laid. If you
hold to the first amount and pay taxes on
that sum, then the rate of the general
tax levy can be lowered and the people be
better able to pay the water rates. If you
hold to the lower valuation, then indeed
your taxes will be less and those of the
people higher, but at the same time the
water, rates will be less, and the people
will be better able to pay taxes.
There is another answer to the sophis
try. If. the exemption of corporations
.from taxes' will enable them to reduce
their public charges, so also will- the ex
emption Â©f the people from taxes enable
them to patronize the corporations more
liberally. . If will be seen then that every
individual tax-shirker is a benefactor of
corporations. In fact it might be as well
argued that the whole burden of munici
pal taxation should be imposed on corpo
rations and the .people left untaxed, so
that they would have more money to
spend on water, gas and streetcar fares for
the benefit of the philanthropists who own
them.
Sophistry is a very pretty trick in the
way of argument, but unless presented
with sufficient brilliancy to dazzle, it de
ceives nobody. The corporations are not
brilliant. They have ' presented their
sophism bare and bald without even a
literary cleverness, much less a logical
dexterity, and thqir weakness in argu
ment is seen as clearly as 'their impudence
in asserting a right to fix water rates on a
.valuation of f 23,000,000 of property, while
derrying-tbe right of the City to tax them
oi> $3,000,000.
REMOVE THE CAUSE.
Not a few people believe that if the Gov
ernment would increase the coinage of the
.metals and issue a large volume of paper
money times would necessarily be good,
but they are mistaken. If the Govern
ment were to increase the circulating
money medium ten times over it would
not be felt at all in -business circles unless
â¢there was something to call it into circula
tion. It is not the purpose of the Govern
ment to coin or print money to give away.
There is complaint everywhere that the
banics of the country are overloaded with
idle ra'oney. If that be true, it is the fault
of the business and not the fault of the
money-malting department of the Govern
ment. Thsre is no money stringency.
There is plenty of it all over the country,
but there Is no occupation for it.
If the per capita money of the country
were $500 it would do the farmer no good
if he had nothing to sell for money, nor
would thÂ« workingman be a whit better
off if he could not sell his labor; and yet
farmers and workingmen, or some of
them, profess to believe that if the mints
were open to silver coinage and the pressts
were printing greenbacks they would see
Streams of money coming their wty; but
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1896.
it would do them no good if there were
thousands of millions of dollars unless the
workingman had work, so that he might
earn money to buy the farmer's produce.
It is the business of tha country, and not
"stacks of money," that makes times
good. Money does not go Into circulation
unless there is something for it to do.
Money does not seek the pocket of the
idle workingman, nor does it hunt for the
farmer unless he not only has something
to sell, but has a customer who is willing
to buy.
There is enough money in this country
to do several times the present volume
of business, but business refuses to swell
its Tolnme so as to give money a chance
to circulate. For nearly three years busi
ness has had no confidence in itself and
money knowing that is in hiding. If the
handicap which the Cleveland adminis
tration put upon our industries and com
merce were removed money would come
from its hiding to pay for raw material and
wages, which in turn wotlld create a de
mand for the produce of the farmer and
the goods and wares of the merchant. It
is business, therefore, and not the Gov
ernment that puts money in circulation,
and if the people want more money in
circulation let them remove the ob
structions which Democratic imbecility has
put in the highways of business opera
tions. There is money enough for the
present, but anyway it would matter not
how much money the Government might
coin and print, it would nevsr reach the
pockets of the people, except through the
channels of trade and traffic.
GOLD, SILVER, MONEY.
A Populist orator asserted in the Mis
souri State Convention the other day that
"The Government fixes the value of gold
by making 22.23 grains of fine metal equal
a dollar. If the Government can do that
it can make a silver dollar by legislation."
The trouble with our Populist friend is
that he is ignorant. The Government of
tne United States does not fix the value of
gold by asserting that a given number of
grains are a dollar. The grains in a dollar
are put there by international commerce
and were our Populist orator to melt a
gold dollar and take the lump to the mint
of any nation he would ret the equivalent
of an American gold dollar, less a small
charge for coinage. The stamp of a nation
upon gold coin is to certify to its fineness
and not its quantity. If 371.25 grains of
pure silver, that is, an American silver
dollar, were melted the lump would %c
worth 54 cents and no more at the mint
of this or any other nation.
Mr. Bryan and his Popocrat following
say that an act of Congress would close
the gap in value between 54 cents and 100
cents, which is the difference in the value
of 371.25 grains of fine silver in bullion
and in an American dollar, but they do
not explain how they are going to make
the people of other nations accept such
dollars in payment for commodities pur
chased by us.
The reason why 371.25 grains of pure sil
ver in the form of an American dollar is
the equivalent of 22.23 grains of pure gold,
either in cola or bullion, 13 because the
faith, the integrity and the moral sen:;e
of the Government are pledged to main
tain silver dollars â not silver bullion â at
par with gold, but were the issue of silver
and paper dollars unlimited the Govern
ment could not carry out its pledge.
The Republican party's plan to close the
gap between silver and gold is to bring the
nations with whom we do business to
gether and enter into an agreement â a
mutual agreementâ that silver dollars or
bullion shall be held in like esteem with
gold dollars or bullion, and that either
one or both shall be accepted in the set
tlement of balances. The Republican
party does not believe that the American
Congress has the right or the power to
establish a monetary system as the basi<)
of trade relations with other countries
without consulting them, nor does it be
lieve we could maintain trade relations
with other countries without an interna
tional monetary system. We have a sys
tem now which makes 22.23 grains of fine
gold the unit of value and the dollar of
final redemption, but it is desirable that
the value of redemption or balance settle
ment money be increased by an amount
equal to the production of silver, and the
Republican party is pledged to accomplish
it by a conference with the nations in in
terest.
WAGES AND PRICES.
The desire of the heart and the burden
of the song of the Popocrat is to better the
condition of the "common people" or "the
masses," but he does not make it quite
clear wbdm he means by "common people
or by "the masses." Strictly sneaking,
we are a Nation of "common people," if
titles of nobility are evidence of supe
riority. Nobility of character and dig
nity of labor are the basis of our social
and political life, but they are attributes
of lofty manhood and cannot be conferred
by edict. Moreover, we are a Nation of
capitalists, and every capitalist is a sov
ereign. It must be, then, that the Popo
crats mean to better the condition of all
the people and npt a particular class, but
do tuey mean the people generally when
they talk about the "common people"?
Certainly not. They mean workingmen â
a class of citizens or sovereigns whom a
plutocratic class are said to be trying to
enslave.
Assuming that we have a plutocratic
class that is bent upon making industrial
slaves of the common people, are they
likely to succeed when there could not be
more than one "plutocrat to ninety-nine
"common people?" But it is the wage
earners that thePopocrats are so solicitous
about, and it is for their great, glorious
and eternal good that they would open
the mints of the Nation to the free and
unlimited coinage of silver without any
safeguards whatever. Without stopping
to inquire to what extent these Popocrat
orators are moved to champion the cause
of labor by the hope of office, we would
ask them how labor is to be benefited by
their monetary theories? It would not be
benefited at all, but it would be greatly
damaged. The workingman's capital is
bis mechanical skill, brain ana muscle.
He employs his capital and li is wages are
his interest, and bis interest money re
munerates his capital exactly in ratio to
its purchase power in the market where
he buys his supplies.
Now, the workingman buys everything
he uses. He produces nothing whatever
for himself but his wages. And not only
so, but he ib a creditor man. The moment
he begins to employ his skill or muscle on
Monday morning, he becomes his em
ployer's creditor, and the debt increases
every hour until payday comes when the
account is settled. But the Popalisis tell
him that if the mints were open to the free
coinage of silver, independent of the labor
that produces very many of his supplies,
and which buys much of his employer's
product, his wages would be higher. Let
that be granted, but would not bis sup
plies advance in price too? Would not
everything be buys cost more? And does
the industrial or commercial woria give
any account of wages ever rising higher
tban commodity price? On the contrary,
there is not a line of history that does not
prove that advances in wages are never in
proportion to the advance in labor's sup
plies.
The history of labor and prices is that
prices move up quickly and often violently,
whereas wages are the last to advance
and the first to decline.
What the "common people" and "the
masses" require is a circulating money
medium that is free from value fluctua
tion. When the workingman goes to work
on Monday morning and credits his em
ployer until payday be wants to know that
he will be paid in dollars whose stability
is as firm as the everlasting hills. The
monetary system of this country makes
all forms of money interchangeable on
their own merit, but their merit is ob
tained from their ability to exchange
themselves for a standard of money which
is recognized everywhere as possessing
full redemption power whether in the
form of money or as a merchantable com
modity.
SENATOR WOLCOTT'S ADVICE.
Senator Wolcott's open letter to the
people of Colorado Is a manly proclama
tion of a manly man. He does not pre
tend to believe or say that the Republican
party 'B platform goes far enough in the
direction of establishing bimetallism in
the United States, but he realizes that
whatever legislation is required to re
monetize silver and to improve the con
dition of the business interests of the
country must come from a Republican
administration. Senator Wolcott honestly
believes the Republican party could bring
about bimetallism in this country inde
pendent of other nations, but he does not
believe the Democratic party could do it
under any circumstances, and hence it is
better to first attempt international bi
metallism than to prejudice the cause of
bimetallism by intrusting it to the Democ
racy. In every attempt at economic and
financial legislation the Democracy has
failed utterly thus far, and that, too, when
its ablest men were at the helm. It cer
tainly follows then that tbe inexperienced
and visionary men of the party would
commit even greater blunders.
Senator Wolcott believes that the silver
declaration of the Chicago platform is in
line with what this country should do,
but a3 every other plank is hostile to our
system of government he feels it to be the
wiser conrse to work for bimetallism on
the plan proposed by the Republican
party than to take any chances of letting
Altgeldism prevail. Mr. Wolcott, like
thousands of other Republicans, knows
that the silver question is not the only is
sue before the country, and he does not
hesitate to say that even could bimetal
lism be secured under a Democratic ad
ministration it would avail the country
nothing because of the mojt hurtful legis
lation in other directions that would be
sure to follow.
Bimetallism is greatly to be desired,
Senator Wolcott thinks, but it is not to be
desired in company with communistic
legislation and the degradation of the
Federal Supreme Couit. We want bimet
allism, the Colorado Senator believes, but
we do not want it at the expense of the
basic principles of the Government. Sen
ator Wolcott urges the people of his State
to consider whether it is better to have
bimetallism by international agreement
and preserve the honor, the dignity, yes,
the very constitution of the Government,
or to accept the Democracy with an un
limited amount of fiat irredeemable paper
money, ownership of the railways and
telegraphs and a swamped Supreme Court
that is pledged in advance to interpret the
constitution and the laws in accordance
with the wild and reckless theories of
Altgeld oi Illinois and Tillman of South
Carolina. Senator Wolcctt is a patriot
and a citizen, who puts the safety of the
country above every other consideration.

WOMAN SUFFRAGE MUST BE
NON-PARTISAN.
LOS ANGELES, CAL., July 81.-The different
woman suffrage committees of southern Califor
nia. It Is undei stood, are planning to do some very
effective campaign work in behali of the eleventh
amendment by forming allied women's clubs to
the old parties. '1 he plan, it is argued, will be per
fectly consistent, owing to the fftct that the tie
publicans, Populists and Prohibitionists all put a
woman-suffrage Â« plunk in their Stale platforms,
and that while the democracy refused tlils, many
of the delegates irom this end of the state favored
it, and are stanch supporters of the movement. It
is considered "gooa politics" to work in connec
tion with instead of independent of the present
ganlzed political parties. _ ,
The plan of action proposed .in the above
item from Los Angeles in â¢ yesterday's Call
would be most disastrous to the woman's suf
frage amendment. Every one j must see that
for a part of the suffrage women to thus ally
themselves with the Bepublican party, another
portion with the Democratic party, another
with the Populist, another ; with the Prohibi
tion, another with the Nationalist, and yet
another with the Socialist "Labor party, would
be to divide and di tract public thought from
women as suffragists 'to women as : Republi
cans, Populists, etc. To do this may be "good
politics," for the different political parties, but
it would surely be very "bad politics" for
amendment No. XI. It doesn't need a prophet
to see that "allied clubs to the old parties"
will turn the thought of the women themselves
to proselyting for members to their respective
political party clubs Instead of each and every
one holding herself non-partisan, or better
all-partisan,, pleading with every man of every
party to stamp "yes" at amendment No. XI,
not for the purpose of insuring success to his
party at the coming election, or to win the
good will of the women of the State for future
partisan ends, but instead, pleading with
every one to thus vote that be may help to se
cure to all the women of California who can
"read the constitution in the English lan
guage" their citizen's right to vote to help the
political party of their choice in all elections
in the good times to come.
Of course each of the political parties, old
and new, would be glad oi the help of the
women throughout this fall campaign, but
who can fall to see , that the women who
should join one alliance would thereby lose
taeir influence with the men of each of the
other parties. They would at once be adjudged
partisans, working for the interest ox the party
with which or â¦to which they were allied.
Women of California,' you cannot ; keep the
good and win - the gcod votes of all the
good men of all the good parties of the State
by allying yourselves with one or the other or
all of them! You must stand as disfranchised
citizens â outlaws â shut out of "the body
politic,", humble suppliants, veriest beggars at
the feet of all men of all parties alike.
. The vote of the humblest man of the humblest
party is of equal value to that of the proudest
millionaire of the largest party. And every
woman must see that if a vast majority of the
women of the State should, under the Los An
geles plan, ally themselves to either one of
the parties, the. men of all the others might
well take alarm lest their party's chances of
success would be vastly, lessened; if women
were allowed to vote and so, front mere party
interest, be "influenced to stamp "no" at
amendment No. XI. - .'â¢"â¢*.
It is very clear to every student of politics
thai what is "good politics" for political
parties is "mighty poor politics" for a reform
measure dependent upon the votes of the
members oi all parties. It will be timeenough
for the women of California, to enroll them
selves as Republicans, .Democrats, Populists,
etc., after they have the right to vote secured
to them by the. elimination of the word "male"
from the suffrage clause of the constitution.
And to work most efficiently to get the right
to become a voting member of one or another
of the parties of the State women must now
hold themselves aloof from affiliation with
each and all of them.
The State Suffrage Campaign Committee has
settled upon a wise plan of campaign, and the
women of every county should advise with it,
by letter or by calling at tbe headquarters,
564 Emporium building, this City. A good
plan well executed is sure to bring victory.
To this end it is to be hoped that the women
of every one of the fifty-seven counties will
hold themselves all- partisan and act in har
mony with the Stale Central Committee.

TWO POPULAR SLEEVES.
While there is no doubt but that sleeves are
to be tight on the forearm for all fall costumes,
yet the comfortable Bishop sleeve is always in
style for shirt waists, house gowns, etc.
The Bishop sleeve is one of the most popular
for round waists, whether of silk, woolen or
cotton fabrics. It is a distinctive feature ot
this summer. An old waist remodeled by a
pair of new sleeves will be unrecognizable,
and it is a simple matter to make a pair of
sleeves, and needs no knowledge of dressmak
ing, thus making an opportunity for any
woman to have an extra waist if a well-fitting
bodice be left of last season's wardrobe. A
black, brown or blue, or, in fact, any plain
waist, may be made stylish and useful by
making sleeves of plaid. Add a collar and belt
of the plaid and the wai>t is done. A plain
fold of the plaid down the center front may
be added, or a strip laid over each shoulder
seam ending in a point over the sleeve.
Sleeves of chiffon in a silk or satin bodice
make a dressy -waist.
A handsome bodice of silk or satin m*y be
made to do admirable service by adding
sleeves of printed velvet, or of the checked or
dtript'd velveteens.
The upper sleeve shown in the illustration is
the melon-sleeve. It is principally popular
for evening and house wear. It is cut in sec
tions, and over the seams joining these is laid
a narrow jet or gimp trimming. A lace is used
from the narrowest to four or five inches in
width.

PAUL NEUMANN'S SICKNESS.
Tbe Patient Moved From the Palace
Hotel to San Rafael.
Paul Neumann, who arrived from Hono
lulu Friday last, somewhat enfeebled by
an ailment of the stomach, was taken yes
terday from the Palace Hotel to the San
Rafael residence of bis son-in-law, Wii
liam F. C. Hasson.
Mr. Neumann says that he was feeling
well when he left Honolulu for this City.
He had placed his affairs in shape to be
away from the islands until November. It
was bis plan to attend the midsummer
high jinks of the Bohemian Club and then
visit Guatemala. Information bad reached
Honolulu that a steamship line between
Central America and Asia was about to be
established, and there was a general de
sire at the islands that arrangements
should be made to indue* the steamers to
stop at Honolulu.
On the fourth day out from Honolulu
Mr. Neumann was attacked by thÂ» stom
ach trouble and prostrated. He had a
similar attack eight months ago and was
laid up for several weeks. In view of the
present sickness the tnp to Guatemala
will probably be canceled.
Mr. Neumann reports that affairs in
Hawaii are tranquil. Only a few people
entertained the idea of a restoration of
royalty. The Queen is living quietly at
Honolulu. The country is fairly prosper
ous and the outlook for better times is
promising, as the sugar crop this season is
exceptionally good.

Morgan stumbled and fell. : His daughter

IITTEBJIATIONAL BIMETALLISM, by Francis
A. Walter, Ph.D., LLD. [For sale by Doxey,
Palace Hotel: price *l 26 ]
Now" that the people of the United States are
involved in a Presidential campaign turn
ing mainly upon the long vexed problem of
the remonetlzatiori- of silver they will be as
â¢sailed with instruptiotfs .on the subject from
tb,e {tress, from the stump and' from a thou
sand pamphleteers. It is to be a campaign
of education, Â»nd air intelligent â¢Americans
know what that*' means. It is fortunate,
therefore, for those who wish to read intel
ligible arguments. on the great issue and to '
arrive .-at conclusions upon which they can
vote with satisfaction, that General Francis
Walker, president' of the Massachusetts In- j
stitute of ; Technology, 'has just published a
summary of a series of. lectures delivered by
him at Harvard University on the subject.
The. work bears the title "International Bi
metallism," and "while thoroughly scientific
in character, 'is written in.'' a style so simple '
and. clear it can "be read and. understood with
ease/by, the average voter.
: It did not require* a Presidential election to
raise the controversy between bimetallists' j
and moneme'tallists. to a white heat. It baa
been at that point ever since the Baring
failure in London, removed the question
from th,e domain of speculative finance and
made it . a vital, issue in the politics both
of Europe Â»,nd*.of America. General Walker
tells us that for a long time past popular
â  misunderstanding of . the controversy has
â¢ been greatly increased by the bitterness and
unfairness ' of the Eastern press. "Many
-'pacers in other things respectable .have never
ceased to denounce those who favored the
'rehabilitation of silver as cranks. . fanatics
â  and lunatics. â¢ Journals ordinarily decent
and dignified hive never, Riven a single
statement as to "what bimetallism is . and
what bimetallism' desire, from which a careful
reader' could form the faintest conception of
that system." . li is not, however, in
. America only, that thts unfair treatment has
been given to the question by the 'mone-met
allists." General Walker quotes a statement
. mVde in 1894- by the Right Hon. Henry
( hap'lii.i, a member of the present British
. Cabinet, "before- the Scottish Chamber of
'Agriculture at Edinburgh in which he said:
"I -often think it is very fortunate" for us
. . fnat we do not-live., in the dark ages, for lam
'_ qu'iie, .'confident if we did we would have
. been burned at the stake, if that were possi
: ble, .by. our monometallic opponents before I
" 'could' escape from Edinburgh." â¢ â 
Leaving the bitterness of the controversy
â¢â ' aside, f General. Walker proceeds to discuss
". the problem both as regards history and as
: . regards trie existing financial condition.
- fhe science of money,* he points out, has its
.' origin in a. commission â¢ appointed by the
British Government in 1666 to reconstruct
; the, monetary system of- that. country. Up to
- that time all monetary laws and regulations
â ' in ail European countries had been the out
growth of the . ignorance and the bigotry of
' the. dark ages. In that British commission,
: however, the " work was entrusted to four
: menâ Somers,' Montague, Lccke and New
.tonâwho constituted one of the most intel
. .leciual ; groups- known to history. It was to
the last of these, Sir Isaac Newton, that we
: are indebted for the' first announcement of
':. the principle .of bimetallism, and, while his
. recommendation was not adopted by the
: British" Government, -it was never afterward
16st sight of, and remained- a permanent con
â¢ tribution" to the science of money. ' .
: The application of- the Newtonian theory
of 'bimetallism to practical use as a monetary
system .was -reserved for Napoleon. He put
' It into effect in -reorganizing' the financial
â¢â  system of France in 1803. ' In speaking of
this decree General Walker 'says: "It was
'â¢ not only to beeome.jind -remain for the two
, generations 'succeeding a power for good
â  which can hardly be estimated, but it was to
â  give, rise to a ' monetary scheme of still
, wider application which should command
the support of hosts of economists, financiers
and statesmen of the highest rank through
! the greatest monetary controversy of the
world's history.*" . â 
* 'The principle of bimetallism as applied by
Kapole.on, and operated in France from 1803 to
' 1873.is thus described: "By declaring the
' two metals indifferently, legal tender in the
. payment of- debts at a certain ratio. It at
â¢once powerfully influences the demand for
the .one and the other of the two metals. This
was. 'what .France, did by the law of 1803. I
j That law gave an. ounce. of gold in coined i
. money precisely the same power to pay debts j
â  'as that possessed by 15}^ ounces of silver in
. (Joined money. The operation of this princi- |
pie was simple, instantaneous, automatic. If
at any time either of the two metals became
less valuable than by the legal ratio, every j
'debtor instinctively sought com of that <
metal with which to meet his obligations in j
'preference to coin of the other metal. This ,
increased the demand for the cheaper metal {
' and by that very act decreased the demand i
for the metal which was becoming dearer in
'-.the .market. Now to increase demand Is
â¢ othet things being equal, to raise price;
â¢yhile -to decrease demand is, other
.-things being equal,' to lower price.
'Thus- through .its' power to regulate
the payment of indebtedness the Gov
ernment practically threw its weight
' upon 'that one. of the two metals which
tended to rise/and kept It down.. No one
wanted the dearer, metal to pay debts with;
â¢ every one wanted the cheaper metal for, that
â purpose: and since the volume cf indebted
! ness* coming j due every day in any commer
cial' country Is very large the. force thus
invoked was sufficient to produce an enor
mops* economic effect. It was not at all |
because ' the : French â  Government declared j
â * that one~p'art of gold should be worth fifteen !
and a half parts ot silver that this result took !
place, but because the trench Government j
let inÂ« motion ' competent economic forces to!
' that "-*'","
The reasons that bimetallism did not succeed
â¢in this country as well as in France are two.' j
. First, the business of the United States is done j
largely with bank notes and is , not "sat- |
urated" with coin as in the business of France,
and consequently the demand for either sil
ver or gold is not sufficient to keep up the
price in a falling market. Second, because
'the .bimetallic 'law has never been fairly
tested the United States. Gerieral Walker
claims that Hamilton in fixing the ratio of
coinage of the United States in 1792 at 15 of
silver *.'o l""of ; gold deliberately underrated
gold, with the intention of letting gold go
\>ut of. the country, as less suited than silver
â¢ to the immediafe wants and occasions of the
American *.: people in that stage ;of their com- (
mercial and industrial development.
. if -bimetallism was' not fairly tried In the
U-uJted States by the act of 1792, still less
fair was the test. made by the act of ; 1834.
' At that time, .says General Walicer, the public
mind* of, this' country was agitated by the
discovery of gold mines of unknown value
In Georgia, North Carolina and elsewhere in
the Appalachian ; range. r i There was thus "ere-; !
â¢ated a" particular and > local interest which
. demanded that gold be j favored in the coin
age, just as forty years , later a particular
and local interest demanded legislation to
â¢promote the use of silver. The bill of 1834
as first introduced made the two ratios ap
proximately that of the market, namely 1 to
'15.6T In this form the measure was appa
rently in the interest of bimetallism. Even .
this appearance was not long maintained.
The ratio of 1 to 15.6 was thrown overboard
and that of 1 to 16 adopted. The bill was
popularly known as the "Gold Bill." Its ad
vocates were jubilant and aggressive and the
purpose of overvaluing gold was announced.
Only one result could follow. Silver then
largely undervalued to a great extent left
the country. '
The demonetization of silver by the German
empire U attributed by General Walker more
to a desire on the part of the leaders of that
nation to Injure France than to any consid
erations of sound financial policy. The de
monetization took place immediately after
the close of the Fr-anco-German war, when the
payment of the heavy indemnity demanded
by the conquerors had drained France of her
coin. General Walker says: "It is rather too
much to ask us to believe that the sentiments
of intense hatred and aversion which war
always enkindles among the combatants
found no shade of gratification In the pro
posal to strike what at that time seemed a
fatal biow at the financial prestige of France
Dy destroying the system which had been set
up by the great Napoleon himself only three
years before Jena."
Of the means by whicn silver was deposed
from its position as a standard money metal
in this country General Walker says only:
"Whije I am disposed to discredit the allega
tion of fraud and sinister motive so bitterly
urged by the silver men, it not the less seems
to me that they have a grievance. No man in
a Dosition of trust has a right to allow a
measure of such importance to pass without
calling attention sharply to it and making
sure that its bearings are fully comprehended.
And no man who did not know that the de
monetization of sliver of the United States
was a measure of transcendent importance
had any right to be on such a committee or
to put his hand to a bill which touched the
coinage of a great country."
Coming down to the present time and to a
consideration of the existing depression in
trade and industry, General Walker attributes
most of the "hard times" to the adoption of
the single gold standard by the leading nations
of the world. It does not matter, he says,
whether we speak of it as a fall in the price of
products or a rise in the price of gold, the
meaning is the same. The producer has been
deprived of a large portion of the value of his
I product while his debts and the lnt-rest on
them remains unchanged. Hence labor and
i the employers of labor are at a disadvan
tage as compared with the money-lender, and
' as a consequence enterprise is checked, indus
i try paralyzed and widespread destitution
i caused in every gold monometallic country.
On this point is quoted the statement of Mr
Balfour "that, a slow appreciation of the
standard of value is probably the most be-
I numbing and deadening influence that can
j touch the springs of enverprise in a nation."
To a like effect is the conclusion of the distin
guished Swiss economist, Professor Walras,
i who says that a permanent condition of fall
ing prices would give us a permanent state of
industrial crisis. Sir Robert Griffin, an au
thority of equal eminence, adds: "An appreci-
I atioa of the money of a country forced on by a
Government is simply a measure for disabling
the productive powers of the people and mak
i ing them poorer than they otherwise would
be."
Though a stanch and earnest bimetallism
as his book attests, General Walker is not a
free silver coinage man of the Bryan type. He
stands with the. Republican party In favor of
I international bimetallism, and says in the
I prelsce to his work: 'For us to throw our
' selves alone into the breach, simply because
we think silver ought not to have been demon
etized and ought now to be restored, would be
a piece of Quixotism unworthy the sound prac
tical sense of our people. The remedy of the
wrong must be sought in the concerted action
of civilized states under an increasing convic
tion of the impolicy of basing the world's
trade upon a single-money metal."
Whether this conclusion suits the reader
will, of course, depend upon his political bias.
The issue has now become one of party poli
tics, and most men will read the work with a
prejudice on one side or the other. It is never
i theless well -worth the reading and the study
of earnest men of both parties. It is the
most learned, lucid and comprehensive work
on bimetallism that hss been published in
anything like a popular style; and amid the
mass of partisan truck and trash that will
soon be spread over the country the book will
have the value of an antidote to mental irri
tation as well as being instructive in itself.

STUDIES OF TREES.
FAMILIAR TREES AND THEIR LEAVES,
by F. Schuyler Mathews. illustrated. fNew
York: D. Appleton <t Co. For sale by William
Doxey, Palace Hotel; price $1 76. J
In his preface to this attractive book, "Fa
miliar Trees and Their Leaves," the author
says: "Possibly there are some of us who may
not think that a leaf is a thing of beauty. We
are prone to use the expression, â¢Nothing but
leaves,' as though leaves were the worthless,
homely and uninteresting things of an other
wise beautiful creation. They' certainly are
common, but they are far from commonplace.
If we doubt this let us try to draw or paint a
single leaf. Only a great artist can depict all
of some one of its manifold truths. One may
draw ever so well, and yet he cannot tell with
the pencil or the brush all the truth and
beauty of one leaf."
It will be seen from this brief extract from
an eloquent preface that we have the work of
an enthusiast before us; and a study of the
pages will show that the task of describing
and picturing the leaves of onr trees has been
done with care and exactness as well as with
love and ardor. Mr. Mathews says: "I have
ventured to draw the trees and their leaves
just as I have found them. My two hundred
and odd sketches were all taken from nature
and only sixty of them from pressed speci
mens, which were obtained in the Harvard
Botanic Garden." As a result of this study
direct from nature we have the true leaf of
each tree portrayed and not the conventional
leaf as it appears to the average observer.
Most readers of the book will find a world of
information they never dreamed of about
leaves that have long been familiar to them.
The study will open to them new sources of
pleasure in every tree around their houses,
and prove interesting as well as instructive.
The Illustrations are good and the work is
supplemented by a systematical index of the
names of trees of the Eastern United States,
including the botanical names according to
Asa Gray and C. S. Sargent.

Here we have an analysis, not of foolishness
in general but of a particular case and phase
of foolishness. Other characters in the book
may have their follies; but James Oldfield,
bachelor, aged 40, selfish, cultivated, peculiar,
a lover of books, a stranger to affairs of the
heart, somewhat of a sportsman, is the fool
study. He is dissatisfied with his past, and at
40 he is suddenly led to sigh for youth long
gone, for he hears a laughing voice that re
minds him of Turkish music, and that voice,
that contains melancholy rather than merri
ment, changes Oldfield's whole life and makes
a fool of him.
The owner of that voice is Miss Tony Jones,
a little, saucy, crippled girl of 18, who has
just returned from alongsiayin Paris. "Green
Gates" is the Jones' country seat near
New York. At first shot Oldfieid's
analysis of the girl is that sne haa
"all that wins, all that is plaintive, un
usual, odd, 'enigmatic in woman, alone
with something which is perhaps wrong."
Oldfield has a young friend, Thaddeus Hicks,

who is Intent on marrying Tony, and he fear
the combination would be dangerous for
Hicks. His solicitation for Hicks orings Old
field under the girl's magic spell, and now
Hicks has a secret and jealous rival in Old
field,who finds it difficult to screen his feelings.
Tony laughs at the love suit of Hicks. She
loughs at the attentions of Oldfield. She chat
ters to both about a third person who is a bad
man already married and whom she calls her
Jabberwock. This is a joke to Hic*s, but a
serious matter to the old bachelor. A ball is
given in Tony's honor. At midnight she sud
denly disappears from the dance hall. Old
field has been studying certain strange sig
nals. He follows the girl and prevents an
escapade. The Jabberwock is In waiting in a
cab, and Tony had plainly been on the way to
the devil when overtaken by the old bachelor.
She is permitted to have a farewell talk with the
Jabberwock and then returns home. .But Tony is
now taken if! aid dies. Life hed nothing
more for her, anyhow, she had s-aid. The doc
tors said her demise was due to a brain
malady. Oldfleld alone knew the cause, but he
keeps to himself the secret of the suicide. He
had been deeply in love with Tony, and couldn' t
tell why. Her death leads him to specula
tions on immortality and heaven and God.
Why had he loved a little brown, reckless girl,
who had suftVred pain which haa finally
grown too big for her small heart and brain?
The whole thing resolves itself down to a be
lief that the more staid and circumspect the
elderly herjrt has been , the more oi a fool heart
It is capable of becoming. Hicks thinks for a
few days that he is broken-hearted, and
The "Lark" Poster for August, Drawn and Cut on Wood by Miss Florence Lundfeorg
tells his friends how sad he is; but
Oldfield, even after he has gone back
to his books, often steals out iv secret to be
stow care on Tony's gray?, and he takes pains
to fling aside such flowers as he thinks were
put on the mound by the Jdbberwock. The
story is out of the usual order, cleverly writ
ten, and not at all tiresome, although the
reader would certainly have just as much ap
preciation for the story If the author had
neglected to run in the catalogue oi Oldfield's
library toward the close.
A GOOD WOMAN'S INFLUENCE
IN THE WORLD.
THE MADONNA OF A DATâ By IÂ» Dons-all.
[New York: D. Appieion <fe Co., publishers. For
sale by William Doxey; paper, price BO cents.]
Here is a novel with a moral to it. A young
woman starts East from Vancouver and walks
off the train in her sleep. She is brought to
her senses in a bank of snow, and then she
travels to the nearest habitation, which is a
rough mining camp filled with desperate, law
less characters. Before commencing the train
journey just referred to, the heroine drinks a
brandy and soda with some men, and then
argues with a missionary that the world would
be better off without so much religion. She is
a woman of the modern school and somewhat
of a journalist. The camp ot men hadn't been
visited by a woman in an age before. Harm
might have come to the heroine, only
that her sudden appearance there in
such beautiful garb as she wore awoke
the slumbering superstitions of some of
the men, who had an idea that she was
the Madonna. This belief being exploded, she
conceived the idea of winning sympathy and
protection by appealing to the religious sense
of the men around her. This plan works well
until she accidentally drops her telltale
cigarette-box, and then a leader of the camp
tells her the game is up. He sends for a clergy
man and wants her to marry him and become
the queen of the camp- She is in a terrible
predicament. Her victuals are drugged soon
after, and, as she feels a faintness stealing over
her she calls to a dwarf who waits upon her
and implores him to save her. He thereafter
drugs the food of the men and puts the camp
to sleep, whereupon he takes horses and speeds
away with the woman to Vancouver and
friends. The experience of a week worked a
change in the world- wise woman, who "knew
now that never again could she see a man de
graded from man's estate without knowing that
woman might have held him up; nay, rather,
exalted him, had woman been pure enough to
do the work that she was given to do." /
ENGLISH IN AMERICAN SCHOOLS.
TEACHING THE LANGUAQE-ARTS-By B.
A. Hinsdale, Ph.D., LL.D. [Mew York: D.
Appleton & Co., publishers. For sale by William
Doxey; cloth, price ?I.J
Professor Hinsdale's volume is a valuable
addition to the International Educational
Series. He holds that improvement is not only
attainable, but decidedly necessary in the
teaching (particularly of English) in our
schools of to-day. His present work is the re
sult of practical experience and it has been
matured by reflection. The author lays stress
on imitation in teaching the language-arts;
insisting upon good models aud emphasizing
the need of practice under suitable correction.
Proficiency in baseball and other athletic
sports is not acquired by studying rules print
ed in books devoted to athletics, but by
practice. A Harvard College committee, hav
ing in mind the came principle, has said:
"It is only through similar, daily and incessant I
practice that the degree of facility in writing
the mother-tongue is acquired which always j
enables the ftudent or adult to uso it as a tool !
in his work." The author remarks that there
|is a great difference between set formal .
j exercises in any art as an end in J
j itself and the habitual use of the same art as a
1 means or instrument to accomplish some other
! end. For instance, what a difference there is
\ between the writing children put in their copy
| books and that which they put into their j
! familiar letters. Nothing but plenty of writ- â¢
| ing, non-formal and extemporaneous, under a j
j moderate tension of criticism, will transmute :
, the student's apeeUto skill and formal skill, i
1 More extemporaneous composition is needed
j in the schools.
The Lindley Murray view of grammar is held
to be mainly false, and sentence analysis is
now taking the place of parsing. The aims
and purposes of this excellent work are briefly
set down as follows:
Firstâ To state fully and illustrate clearly
I the principles that underlie all practical lan
i gunge culture, whether it assumes the form of
speech, reading or composition.
Secondâ To emphasize the value of such cul
tureâthe education that grows directly out of
the use and study of the vernacular.
Thirdâ To present to teachers some methods
and devices that, intelligently followed, will
enable them to carry on the child's instruction
in the language-arts in harmony with the un
derlying principles. These methods and de
vices cover in a general way the whole field up
to the college; they even touch the college
and reach far into the field of self-cultivation.
Fourthâ To discuss grammar and rhetoric
with a double purpose: first, to determine
STORIES OF DISTINGUISHED PETS
wherein their educational value lies, and, sec
ondly, to point out their relations to the lan
guage-arts.
The teaching of literature and the functions
of criticism In the language-arts also receives
merited attention.

In this little worl; Mr. Treadwell treats the
sliver question from the plane of known facts
of currency in every part of the world, dealing
with the problem on the well-Known method
followed by the Bauk of France and also
by the Government of Switzerland. His
solution is that if paper money be removed,
there will be created in the currency of every
nation a vacuum, into which silver will flow,
and that the demand for silver to fill that
vacuum will be so great as to raise silver to
par.
CURRENT MAGAZINES.
FRANK LESLIE'S POPULAR MONTHLY.
"Cuba's Struggle for Liberty" is the subject
of a fully illustrated article in Frank Leslie's
Popular Monthly for August. It is written by
Fidel G. Pierra, one of tne leading spirits of
the Cuban delegation in New York, and con
tains portraits ot Generals Gomez, Maceo,
Marti, Carillo, Sanchez, Garcia, Rodriguez and
Palma and some interesting views. Another
feature of this number is an article on the
Christian Endeavor Society by Rev. Francis E.
Clark, its president and founder, with many
attractive illustrations. The Lee series is con
tinued with the first of two papers on General
Lee's part in the battle of Gettysburg by
Colonel John J. Garnett, Confederate Artillery.
GODEY'S.
Godey's Magazine for August contains much
entertaining summer reading. Half a dozen
pieces of fiction in as many Jteys give a very
readable variety in that line, and something
stranger than fiction Is told in Albert L. Parkes'
anecdotes of Anna Bishop in the series of
"Great Singers of This Century." It seems
that this prima donna was under the control
of M. Bochsa, the harpist and musical director,
in much the same way tnat Trilby, the tone
deaf, was dominated by Svengali in the story,
and there Is said to be reason to suppose that
her career suggested this pert of Dv Maurier's
novel. "Some Armenian Notables" gives many
unfamiliar and interesting facts in regard to
the ill-treated nation of Asia Minor and its
greatest men and women.
m'clttre's magazine.
The August McClure's is the "Midsummer
Fiction Number.' ' Octave Thanet contributes
a strong story of Western life; Stephen Crane
relates a dramatic episode in the later life of
the hero of "The Red Badge of Courage";
Clinton Ross tells a booming battle story,
based on Perry's historic victory on Lake Erie;
E. M. Thomson tells a humorous tala of the
Canadian fishermen; and Annie Eliot de
scribes a double love episode in a Yale and
Harvard boat-race. It is not often that five
really good stories, as these certainly are, get
into a single magazine. ||Then, in addition,

the special features are: "The White Mr.
Longfellow," by William Dean Ho wells; a
poem by F. Whitmore; "Peeps Into Barbary,"
by J. E. Budgett Meakin; "The Strange Days
That Came to Jimmie Friday," by Frederick
Remington; "Doorstep Neighbors," by W.

publication.
ST. NICHOLAS.
The midsummer holiday season is fully ob
served in St. Nicholas. "An August Outing"
is a full-page picture drawn by M. O. Kobbe,
and I. W. Taber sets forth the Minuet at "The
Grasshoppers' Ball." "The Little Duchess and
the Lion-Tamer" is a Russian story by Fanny
Locke Mackenzie, telling how a brave and
quick-witted child saved the Czar from assas
sination. Ernest Ingersoll, in "The Tricks of
Torpedo Boats," describes the night prac
tice of these dangerous little craft when
they are maneuvered against the great
battle-ships. Harry M. Lay shows the
possibilities of "A Sand-Pile" in the way of
furnishing subjects for realistic photograph?.
He had a pile of sand in the yard of his city
home and with the aid of toy soldiers, horses
and cannon made the most surprising battle
scenes. Two papers are full of kindly remi
niscences ana anecdotes of Eugene Field, the
children's poet. They are written by Mary J.
Reid and Henrietta Dexter Field and Martha
Nelson Yenowine.
THE CENTURY.
The midsummer holiday (August) Century
makes its appearance in a distinctive cover.
The onening paper, "An Island Without
Death," by Miss E. R. Scidmore, the author
of "Jinrikisha Days," gives an account of a
visit to Miyajima, a sacred island in the
Inland Sea, one of the three great sights of
Japan. A paper on "The Viceroy Li Hung
Chang" is contributed by the Hon. John W.
Foster, who, it will be remembered, was lately
confidential adviser to the Emperor of China,
and in that capacity accompanied the Viceroy
to Japan, where the treaty of Shimonoseki
was negotiated. General Foster, who is to be
the host of Li Hung Chang in September, and
is one of his most intimate friends, by
this relation and by Intimate experience of
Chinese affairs, has had unique facilities for
the preparation of this paper. There is printed
the first of a group of articles from the jour
nals of the late E. J. Glave, who crossed Africa
in the service of the Century in exploration of
the slave trade. The article deals principally
with "British Raids on the Slave-Traders," and
is fully illustrated with photographs ana draw
ings by the author. Among other features are
four short stories â one of life in the Chinese
quarter of San Francisco, by Chester Bailey
Fernald; one of a Minnesota frontier town, by
Marion Manville Pope; one of the Maine
woods, by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and
one of the New Orleans Creoles, by Kate Chopin.
The fiction number of Scribner's Magazine
contains six short stories and a little comedy, <
in addition to several special articles of wide!
popular interest, including the first paper in â 
A. F. Jaccaci's picturesque account of his \
journey "On the Trail of Don Quixote," and
Mrs. Alice Morse Earle's "Old Gardens," de
scribing the old-fashioned flower-gardens that
still persist In some New England villages.
Artistically, this Issue contains several novel j
features. Virgie, the great French illustrator, i
seldom seen in periodicals, has made twenty- â 
five drawings for the Don Quixote article.
Miss Cecilia Beaux, an American painter who ,
has achieved distinction also in France, fur
nishes tne frontispiece of this numberâ her
first illustration for any magazine. Orson j
Lowell, whose reputation has been made as an i
illustrator by his work in this magazine, has
made numerous unique drawings to accom
pany a brilliant little play by Annie Eliot
called "As Strangers." The cover, printed in
twelve colors, is from a drawing by Will H.
Low, and is very elaborate.
UPPINCOIT'S.
The complete novel in the August Lippin
cott's is "The Great K. & A. Train Robbery,"
by Paul Leicester Ford. The scene shifts from
one part of the West to another; the action
has some rapid and surprising turns, espe- |
cially when the actors are considered; and the I
result is a readable and lively narrative.
Clarinda Pendleton Lamar is evidently at
home "In Louisa County," and writes with
full knowledge and affection. Her story
brings vividly before us the rural Virginia of j
old, with its hospitality, its unworldliness, its
primitive and peculiar charm. "Golden-Rod I
and Asters," by Neith Boyce, is a tale of youth
renewed after a long interval, and of middle
aged reunion. George Mont bard, a French art-
Jst in London, tells of "A Narrow Es
cape" which ho and a comrade had during
the Franco-Prussian war, the result of a rash i
adventure on the outposts. "Heraldry in
America" may appear to many an unpromising
subject, but Eugene Zieber has much to say in
exposition, defense and praise of it Rhoda
Gale writes of "Immigration Evils" and sus
tains her argument by figures and facts. The
poetry of the number consists of a sonnet by
John B. Tabb and quatrains by Edith M.
Thomas, Clarence Urmy and Arthur W. Atk
inson.
THE ARENA.
All lovers of Whit tier, and for the matter of
that, all who love a beautiful life, will be in
terested in the article in the August Arena en
titled "Whittterâ The Man." This article is
one of a series on Whittier by the editor, B. O.
Flower. Amongother features of the Arenaare:
"Bibliography of Literature, dealing with the
Land Question," by Thomas E. Will, A.M; "Is
the West Discontented?" by John E. Bennett;
"Club Life versus Home Lite," by G. S. Craw
ford; "A Social Settlement," by Annie L. Muz
zey; "Mahayana Buddhism in Japan," by
Annie E. Cheney; "The Convict Question." by
J. Kellogg ; "Ethics the Only Basis of Religion,"
by R. B. Marsh, M.A. ; "Associated Effort and
Its Influence on Human Progress," by M. L.
Holbrook, M.D.; "Philosophers Afloat," by

SCIENTIFIC AMERICA*.
To commemorate the conclusion of fifty
years' service in the departments of art,
science, mechanics and cnemistry, Munn &
Co., the Droprietors of the Scientific American,
have issued an anniversary number of their
journal.
The number contains valuable matter of
more than ordinary interest to the average
reader. Full reports are published of the ad
vance made during the past five decades in
ship-building, railroads, engineering, tele
graph and cable laying, as well as in inven
tions that have had more recent birth, as the
bicycle and the newer photographic processes.
A feature is made of an essay entitled. "The
Progress of Invention During the Past Fifty
Years." This gained the prize of $250 offered
by the proprietors of the Scientific American.
Its author is Edward M. Byrn of Washington,
D. C, and it forms a remarkably comprehen
sive statement of the subject.
In France a third edition has already been
called for of Albert Vandal's work, "Louis XV
et Elisabeth de Russie." The volume is an ex
haustive study of the relations between France
and Russia in the eighteenth century. It may
be added that it has been "crowned" by the
French Academy.

; Burse, in his morning wal-ks, would oft,en. stop

said, as plainly as words could have satd, â â !

| beast deliberately laid his "bead on Mr. B*urke's
| bosom. Overwhelmed by- the tenderness of tha
! animal, expressed in the mute e.oquenceot holy
nature's universal language, the illustrious states
man for a moment lost his self-possession, and,
clasping his arms around -his son's favorite â ani
mal, lifted up that voice which had caused tha
arches of Westminster Hall to ecijo the noblest
strains that sounded within them, ana wept *
aloud. Burke is gone; but, sir, so hold me heaven,
| if I were called upon to designate the e\'o'nt or
I the period in Burse's life that would best sustain
I a charge of insanity, it would not be when, in a
' gus:i of the holiest and purest feeltne that ever
stirred the human heart, he wept aloud on the
neck ota dead son's favorite horse.
"We long for an affection altogether igno.
rant of our faults," says George Eliot, "H*eaven
has accorded this to us in the uncritical canine
i attachment." And so we listen again to stoÂ«
i ries of affection between dogs and their mas
ters, from that of the dog Argus, wfiich died
of joy on the return of Ulysses after- twenty
| years' absence, to that of the dog Nero, /which
Bismarck honored with a formal funeral. â¢
Miss Sanborn does not neglect to refresh the
j memory of her reader with the historical facts
; that Egyptians held the dog in adoration as a
representative of one of the celestial signs; that
the Indians considered him one of the sÂ».cred
forms of their deities; that the dog is placed at
the feet of women in monuments to symbolize
affection and fidelity; and that many o'f tLe
Crusaders are represented with their feet.on a
dog, to show that they followed the standard
of the Lord as a dog follows the footsteps of
his master.
In this literary "zoo"' we' find Arthur's dog
Cavall alongside of Dora's dog Jip; and Doug
lnss' dog Luffra, from the "Lady of the Lake," â 
has a place near Landseer's dog "Brutus,
I painted as the "Invader oi the Larder." Then *
I there is Katmir, the dog of the Seven Sleepers;
Barry, the St. Bernard dog which saved forty
human beings, and Sir Isaac Newton's dog .
i Diamond, which by overturning a candle, dfe-
I stroyed a wealth of precious manuscript.
Many poetical tributes to dogs by great
writers are quoted, such as those from the
pen of Mrs. Browning, Lord Byron, words
worth, Cowper, Spencer and Matthew Arnold.
The author and compiler observes, that
while public sentiment is not so unaniinousjy
in favor of cats, yet they have their warm adÂ«
mirers, while In Egypt they were worshiped
as an emblem of the moon. "When a cat died
the owners gave the Dody a showy funeral,
went into mourning and shaved off their eye- '
brows. Diodorus tells of a Roman soldier who â
was condemned to death for killing a cat. It *
is said that Cambyses, King of Persia, when he
went to fight the Egyptians, fastened, before
every soldier's breast a live cat, and their ene
mies dared not run the risk of hurtfng their
sacred pets, and so were conquered."
We are told that artists, monarchs, poets,
diplomatists, religious leaders, authors h%ve
all condescended to care for cats, ami that a
mere list of their names would make a big
book. For instance, to quote Miss' Sanborn :
Godefroi Mind, a German artist, was called the
"Raphael of Cats." People wonld hunt up in his
attic and pay large prices for his pictures In the
long winter evenin.s he amused himself by carv
| ing tiny cats out of chestnuts and could not make
them fast enough for those who wanted 1 to buy.
Mohammed was so fond of his cat Muezza that
once, when she was sleeping on his sleeve, he cut
of! the sleeve rather than disturb her. Andrew
Doris, one of the rulers of Venice, not only had a '
portrait painted of his pet cat, but after her death
j ::ad her skeleton preserved as a treasure. Kiche
lien's special favorite was a splendid Angora, his,
rest Ing- place being the table covered with state
papers. Montaigne nsed to rest himself by a frolio
with his cat. iontenelle liked to place his "Tom"
in an armchair and deliver an oration before him.
The cat of Cardinal Wohey sat by his side when
he received Princes, and Petrarch haa bis pet
feline emba'med and placed in his apartment.
Miss Sanoorn cannot help remarking tnattha
idea of the cat being the pet of old maida
alone is far from true. Even so dignified a
personage as Pope Pius IX is shown to have,
allowed his cat to sit with him at table, wait
ing his turn to be fed in a most decorous,
manner. There are numerous extracts from,
poets and authors who have devoted stanzas
and periods to cats, and the pages are air full
of interest.
"It would be pleasant to believe It was a.
proof of a good and tender nature to dÂ«light
in pets," observes Miss Sanborn, "but men and
women notorious ior cruelty and bad lives
have been devoted to them, lavishing tender
ness elsewhere denied." â¢

THE HOOP A VALLEY INDIANS
Hobpa" Valley, in Hum bold t County,
â¢an Indian elysiuni, is a Government
reservation, in which, sinre tB3& from 400
to COO Indians have lived under the care of
agents, and gradually added to their in
herent virtues and vices those of our higher
civilization.
' California stands alone in tbe Union in
not having recocnized the Indian's right
of .occupancy and given compensation for
.lands taken. It was this fact, possibly, and
in order to prevent future encroachments
from the whites that in 1855 the Govern
ment established a fort in the valley,
known as ForfGaston.
Fouryears ago, in response to the appli
cation of the Women's Indian Association
of- Northern California, the soldiers were
removed, and within two years the bar
jacks were turned into an industrial
school, manned and womaned by efficient,
wise and sympathetic teachers.
Lands in severalty have been given to
the heads of families which they cultivate,
raising wheat, oats and vegetables. Most
of tbe Indians can speak English, dress
Irke white people and live in homes which

timbers, and whose architecture is closely
allied to that of a Chinese fisherman's hut,
to houses containing floor?, partitions and
sometimes cupboards,. A saw and a grist
hiill are.situated on the reservation, which
is- reached by a fifty-mile ride over the
mountains from either Arcata or Eareka,
on horseback, on a pack mule or by wagon.
Facts do not lie. Says reliable onthor

'AU-this is rathe): an odd statement to
iimk.e, but it is a seriqus fact and a most
agreeable one to many lovers of dogs who
ir;vefwith their pets. GW. Brown, the
host of the dog hotel and also the well
. known livery stable keeper on Stevenson
' street is rather modest concerning his
' "care for dogs on the American plan and
; dQps'not line to have it spoken of in a
facetious manner.
' -"The business was forced npon me," he
-â¢â¢â¢ say.s. "Unless I have a special liking for
a pet animal, like my foxhound, for in
stance, I would not give $10 for all the
dogs in Christendom. But my place is so
handy to the downtown hotels wnere dogs
are pot allowed to be quartered that it soon
crew, to be tbe practice of tbe clerks at tha
.Palace, Grand, Occidental and other hotels
to send travelers who had dogs with them
to my livery stable -on Stevenson street.
..At- first I took care of the dogs merely as
an accommodation for ac.ual and pros
pective patrons. I treated the pets well,
gave them proper food and care â in fact I
treated them too well. I suppose, for soon
I was fairly overrun with valuable dogs.
'.'The, expense of properly caring for
them -was considerable, so much so, in
facVthat I finally realized that I must
either five up my care of these pets or
,4Â»lse"c.harj;e for their 'maintenance.
"To rjiirsue the former course would be
to discommode a great many patrons, I
found, so I established a uniform rate of
fifty .cents a day' ior the keeping of all
dogs' that were brought to me. It isn't
â¢ hardly a dogs' hotel thai I keep, though
Fom'e of the funny fellows like to call it
that." At different times I have had a
gbbd many dogs, some oi them very valu
... able ones, in my keeping, bnt there are
times again.when there are not more than
a couple of dogs arouud the livery stable.
One pf these is my own foxhound and the
.other was .until recently the erstwnile
famous Miss Chambliss.
""She .had been with me for much over a
year, and as the Police Court decided that
â¢Author Chambliss was not the responsible
owner of the dog, there was nothing for
rne-'to do but keep her till she died on my
"hands.
"She had the best of care. In the
basement 1 have a large box stall fitted up
purpf sely for the accommodation of my
â¢canine guests. The place is lLht, dry,
.'warm, well ventilated and sanitary in
â¢ every way. There is always an abundance
of : fresh straw and good food. I have the
dogs brought upstairs and washed in
â¢ warm water regularly, and I keep a boy
whose chief duty it is to take the dogs out
for exercise. Of course, dogu that stay
with me only for a week or month, as the
case may be, must be kept chained all the
time, and to keep these in good com! it ion
they must have their regular daily outing.
As old and well-known guest like Miss
| the United States, and scattered through- ,
j out the State, living by their own efforts,
! were 11,517 of tnese former much -despised

The experimental stage of Indian educa- j
tion in Hoopa Valley is passed, and its
isolated native population are demon
strating their manhood and capacity fur
enlightened citizenship.
Their kindness to their dogs and horses
j makes a society for the suppression of
cruelty to animals unnecessary. An oath
is never heard on the reservation â not
even from the mule drivers â and from
"Old Judie," the interpreter, who wecr3
"a store hat and green goggles," to little
Nathaniel, who attends the kindergarten
and la" * his head upon his teacher's breast
in tie gloaming, while she tells him of the
wide, wide world without the valley, there
is peace.
The Indiana believe in witchcraft and
retain as many superstitions as their pale
faced brothers (some of whom have been
to college) paying tribute to the Indian
devil from the same motive precisely that
makes the China man placate his joss.

the sea has carved upon the rocks at
Monterey. He is tall, "straight as an In

parted in the middle, a Roman nose and
, strongly defined features. His costume,
I when in full dress, is merely a blue flannel
shirt, but tbe dignity with which he as

I had to pay out I
good dollars for the I

es. I suppose it
would have been cheaper, upon the whole, !
for me to have taken out a license and pur
chased a collar in the first place. She
came and went as she pleased, and was
pretty well known all over the neighbor
hood by the name that the boys christened
her with when Chambliss first sent her
over here."
It was due to the notoriety which this
doc brought to Mr. Brown's establishment
a year or more ago daring his suit in the
Police Court against W. H. Chambliss for
the maintenance of this animal that the
knowledge of Mr. Brown's hotel for docs
became public property. And while Mr.
Brown candidly admits that a considera
ble business in the line of boarding, lodg
ing and caring for canines has been forced
upon him he does not seek fame as the
proprietor of a dog hostelry.
"Some peoplfi have thought my charge
of $169 for the keep of this dog was ex
travagant.'' said he. "They ought to
know the real cost of caring for a dog in
the way I do. For food alone the expense
amounts to about 20 cents a day. Every
morning I send to the butcher's and buy
meat. Of course, I don't get porterhouse
steak, but I do pet fresh, wholesome meat
I send to the bakery for bread, and then
i have a bread and meat stew cooked in the
yar.i. This is the regular fare for all the
dops in my care, unless the owner is will
', ing to pay an additional price for a more
! delicate menu. Leaving out of count the
i difference between the doe's and a horse's
j food, 1 would much rather care for a
j horse, even at the same price. You don't
I know the amount of watchfulness and
! care that a good dog requires. A horse
has to be curried every day, but I would
rather curry a horse twice than bathe a
dog once. There is carbolic soap to buy,
hot water to procure, and usually a most
refractory brute to deal with. On an
average it takes as long to clean a dog as
lit does to clean a horse. Then, too, when
I the horse is in his stall he is quiet and
contented, while erery other dog that
comes to my place spends all of his time
that is not taken up in eating in trying to
raise the dead with his yelping.
"Some of the dojts that I have to care for
have cost me and my men a good deal
more than the price paid for their keep.
They had a big bloodhound once that was
so ferocious that they found it necessary to
keep him chained tightly in a stall all by
himself. That dog had an insatiable appe
tite. The regular allowance for another
dog amounted to barely an appetizer for
him. They doubled his allowance, then
they trebled it, and yet he chewed the
stalls in pieces and tried to masticate his
j chain. There wasn't a boy, or a man

them from tbe strong roots of certain
grasses and decorating them with the mid
ribs of ferns. Without any machinery
but their deft fingers these patient Pen
elopes of the forest produce baskets whose
tautness defies time, usage and water leak
age, and the geometric accuracy of the
colored designs wrought in them without
any pattern for a guide is a marvel. Some
day the Inaian woman will be both poet
and painter.
The most solemn, grotesque, yet impor
tunt, of the festivals of the Hoopas is
known as the white-deer dance, which oc
curs every three years, lasts ten days, and
is of as much importance to them as a
Fourth of July celebration to us. It is a
thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth.
The men who work on the farm on week
day?, who race horses or who sing Gospel
hymns on Sunday will paint barbarously
on this occasion, deck their heads with
woodpeckers' feathers and load their half
naked bodies with neculaces of polished
shells, shaped like tiny hollow horns, and
broad girdles of red, white and black deer
skin.
An old chief, while preparing a dancing
rattle-stick, expounded to a teacher the
origin of the great deer dance. His words
were as follows :
"Good young man live long time ago.
Nevtr swear, never kill, never touch
women. He no die, he go away. He here
now, we no see him. He say, 'Have
dance.' He God."
Then, in a Jow, deprecating voice, he
gave in terse terms the equivalent of each
command in the second table of the law

relating to our tenth commandment, and
"Injun God say no lie," to that of the

either for that matter, in the stable who
had the bravery or the foolhardiness to
take that brute out for a morning consti
tutional. His owner was an English gen
tleman who stopped at the Palace Hotel for
nine days. The men at the stable were glad
that be did not stay ten days. He brought
the dog to the hotel, and was quite put out
when they informed him that they could
not accommodate his bloodhound in the
same caravansary. They sent him over to
the Nucleus.
"No, we have not different priced ac
commodations for different breeds of
dogs," said Mr. Brown. "We are purely
democratic in that respect," said Mr:
Brown laughingly. "My lady's lapdog,
be he a fleecy white poodle with red eyes
and blue ribbons, or be he a snarly little
English pug, sleeps in the same bed, eats
the same food and has the same care be
stowed upon him as the greyhound, the
setter or the meanest mongrel that should
be brought to my door by a responsible
person. But, as I have told you, my busi
ness is that of a liveryman, and I would
be glad enough never to have a dog about
the place if I could see my way clear to
do so."
It is the proximity of the Nucleus sta
bles to the Palace and other hotels, as well
as Mr. Brown's genial disposition and
kindly treatment of alt dumb animals
intrusted to his care, that has made his
place famous as a boarding-house or hotel
for dogs. It is run strictly on the Ameri
can plan, and while all the necessary com
forts are provided for canine guests
there are certain privileges not ac
corded them. For instance, canine
guests are not permitted the privi
lege of a latchkey. Lights are not
! allowed in private rooms after dusk.
Guests'may not receive callers unless the
same are brought there and vouchsafed
for by some member of the family. There
are no electric lights, no speakiu^-tubesor
electric bells, and meals may not be or
dered at any or all hours. Messenger-boys
and cabs are not to be secured by card.
There are no privileges of the bar, and
guests are not permitted the luxury of a
fire in their room nor the privilege of
blowing out the gas. To offset some of
these seeming disadvantages are certain
rules and regulations which place guests
of the Nucleus canine hostelry in rather
an enviable position as compared with
guests at many of the fashionable caravan
saries for the human animal. One of
these is that guests are not expected to
report any inattention or rudeness on the
part of the waiters or attaches of the house
to the management. Another is that tip

|Jot a NeW Story, but Qood
The recent case of baaing at West Point
and the revelations concerning that acad
emy made in The Sunday Call a few
weeks ago have recalled to the minds of the
old settlers and residents of Siskiyou
County ihe days when there were similar
occurrences in this county. Tnese were
the days of the "Order of Eclampus Vitus"
â the salad days of Yreka.
The story has been told before. It is
part of the history of Eiskiyou County.
Yet the younger generation knows it not.
Their elders will appreciate its recital now,
lam assured. There lived a merchant in
Yreka. He sold dry goods and clothing.
His name was Jacob Ehrenbacher, but
tLey called hfm "Steamboat Jake."
It was in the palmy days of Yreka, in
the year 185U, that Mr. Ehrenbacher felt
his heart drawn toward the noble princi
ples of Odd Fellowship, and sought to
unite himself with that order. His actions
I in the matter led those to whom he ap
plied to believe that be wanted to join for
the purpose of becoming sick, apparently
so, and enjoying the benefits devolving
upon one in that condition. It was re
solved to punish him and give him such
an idea of secret societies as would banish
from his mind all thought of joining one
in the future.
There was at that time this lodge of the
Most Ancient and Honorable Order of
Eclampus Vitus, an order that existed
simply and solely for the sport that could
be had in initiating novices into its mys
teries. The ceremonies were the most
ludicrous and awe-inspiring that the fer
tile brain of man could conceive. Into the
order three practical jokers of tne town â
Pembroke Murray, George W. Stilts and
Wiley Foxâ proposed to induct the in
quisitive merchant. They represented to
him that for tbe modest sum of $50 he
could join the Odd Fellows, Masons and
"Eclampus Vitus," and took his applica
tion and cash, having a royal good time
with the latter.
The most appalling ceremonies of the
I Eclampus Vitus, as well as all tbe means
1 they coma devise by which a man could
NONE WERE BURIED ALIVE
John Sawyer, grave-digger, busily en
gaged at his trade down one of the by
paths of the Laurel Hill Cemetery yester
day, looked up from his work at the ques
tion of his visitor and said :
"tfes; I notice that it is reported from
England that some movement is on foot
to provide against burying people who are
not dead."
He struck hiu short pick into the earth j
once tr twice and then shoveled out upon
tbe pile at the side of the grave the loose
sand that had fallen under the blows. ,
"it is a proper precaution,' 1 he said, '
"for it is true that no more horrible expe
rience may be imagined than that of being
buried alive.
"It is not for me to say that such a thing |
never happened. I can say, however, that |
in an experience of twenty years in a I
graveyard I have never come across a sin
gle instance where there were any indica
tions of life having returned to a person
buried.
"I was engaged for a year doing nothing j
else but taking up the bodies from graves j
where they Lad lain for different periods ;
of time extending from five to twenty- \
seven years. It was the occasion of the j
clearing up of the graveyards west of this |
a few years ago. We took up 1100 bodies, I
and I kept a strict lookout, as did every
other man engaged in the worK, for come
sign of a body having turned or moved in
the coffin. But there was not one. Sol
do not have the dread of premature burials
that I once had, although, as I say, it is
well enough to be sure that a person is
dead before burial."
"And what would you suggest?"
''Cremation. It is the most sensible and
cleanest, in every way the best method of
disposing of the dead. Although," con- '
be deceived and frightened, were arranged
in one grand programme, as he was not
to be inducted regularly into the order.
All the good fellows of town were posted
on the affair, whether members of the or
der or not, and when the night came
which was to remove the veil of mystery
from before the eyes of the confiding mer
chant the hall was crowded with eager
spectators. The ceremonies commenced
in the most solemn and impressive man
ner, and as they proceeded, ever and anon
the whole assembly would give a sepul
chral groan, to which, according to in
structions previously given, the candidate
responded "Limbo." As tbe evening wore
on and he became more and more terrified
his pronounciation of the magic word be
came less distinct, until nothing could be
made of it but "Steambo," and he became
"Steamboat Jake" upon the spot.
At one time it was represented to him
that each of the three orders must brand
him with a red-hot iron, and to fully im
press him witb the reality of tbe intended
act, they began to dispute among them
selves as to which order took precedence.
Pembroke Murray dated the Masons back
to Moses, bnt Stilts settled the dispute by
conclusively proving that* Adam was the
first member of the Eclampus Vitns, and
to that order was granted the privilege of
first putting its brand upon the now thor
oughly frightened man. Great demon
strations of heating an iron and of making
other preparations were made, and when
all was ready he was touched upon the
back with a piece of ice. In his imagin
ation he could feel the scorching iron burn
deep into his flesh, and he bounded into
the air, screeching and groaning in the in
tensity of his pain and fright. His yells
and cries could be distinctly heard a block
away by people in their houses.
For a long time he writhed and shrieked
under the relentless deceptions of his per
secutors, while all were convulsed with
laughter.
Finally his nervous system gave way
under the strain and he fell down in a fit,
frothing at the month. The merriment
was suddenly changed to fear and appre
hension. The unconscious man was borne
to his store, where four physicians labored
over him for an hour. No one expected to
see him open his eyes to the light of day
again, but he was at last resuscitated and
all dancer was past. Before this Murray
had gone home, leaving word with Stilts
to come to the house and tell him the re
sult. As soon as the good news was an
nounced, Stilts said to John Loag; "John,
have you got the old cayuse down at the
stable?"
"Yes," he replied. Said Stilts, "Well
tinned lhe grave-digjer, pausing from his
work in his interest in his subject, "I have
to say that I had to remodel my notions
about the dead considerably as a result of
that year of delving into old graves. There
was nothing of that obnoxiousness that is
usually associated with the buried hnman
body. That is an incident of a few weeks
or months after death. After that it
passes away and the Dody simply turns to
dust. 1 saw nothing of the 'conqueror
worm.' I have never seen him in all my
experience except once, and that was a
body that remained in the vaults for some
time.
"Ordinarily I can tell just about how a
body will look at any certain stage after
death. Tell me how many days a man
has been dead and how the body has been
cared for and I can tell yon in what con
dition it is. But that year's digging in old
graves found many exceptions to my rule
also. There was a woman, for instance,
tliat we found in one of those old-fash
ioned narrow iron coffins, bolted together
and sealed, that had lain iv tno narrow
box for twenty-seven years. The face that
appeared under the little oval glass looked
as though it had only ceased to breathe.
It was wonderfully preserved. I suppose
it was the result of the complete exclusion
of the air from contact. When a body
was placed in one of those narrow old
iron coffins it came very near being buried.
"I learned with rejtard to this case that
it had been placed in the vaults and
abandoned. No one had come for it, and it
had been buried after a time in the cheap
graves that were then being dug np.
There were other instances of the kind.
In the matter of the preservation of the
body very much depends upon the coffin
or casket â as much as npon tbe embalm

-How so?"
"Why, I'll 20 down
I there and tell him
I the merchant is I
I dead and we must
I leave town to avoid
I arrest, and you send
I him the old cayuse
I to ride on!"
The plan was well
I laid, and all the late
I revelers were in the
house
ana rapped softly on the door,
which was opened by the anxious
Justice. Assuming a most lugubrious ex
pression of countenance, Stilts said:
4 He's dead as a smelt, aud I am going
to Oregon. tfave Colton is getting oat the
papers now to arrest us. I've told the boys
we were Koing to Oregon, and Dave will
hear of it and ride to the Klamath ferry
to capture us. Now, there will be a korse
here in a few minutes. Mount him, and
get to Shasta as quick as you can. I'm go
ing to Oregon on foot, and I will be across
the line by daylight."
Saying good-by, he struck off in the
direction of Oregon at a rapid pace. Soon
a horse was led cautiously up to the door
by George Waterhouae, who assisted Mur
ray to mount, charging him to get out of
the country before daylight, ana bade him
godsneed.
The old cayuse was a pack animal, to
which any gait faster than a drowsy walk
was an otter stranger. He took as long to
pass any given point as a procession. In
vain did the anxious fugitive on his back
cluck, kick and swear. He had no spars,
no whip to encourage him with. Riding
up to a fence he broke off a picket, and
with this commenced a vigorous prod
ding, eliciting a spasmodic trot of half
a dozen steps and then the walk was re
sumed. Again and again was the brute
prodded, and again and again did he re
spond with a lone racking trot of six
steps. After slowiy plodding along Main
street until Miner was safely passed, the
exasperated man gave vent to his feelings
in a flood of tears and imprecations. "This
is a pretty beast to give a man to save a j
life w ith," he blubbered. "If i had a pis- |
tol I'd shoot the man that gave him to me.
If I only had a knife I'd cut the brute's
throat. Get up, you lazy hound," he
Bhouted as he dug the offending animal's
ribs with the fence picket. "Get up; get
up. I'd walk if I wasn't lamp. Get up.
Oh, I'll shoot the man that did this."
Jast then the jokers, who had followed
close behind him, began to yell. "There
he goes!" and to fire their pistCTs. The
sensitive ear of the fugitive caught the
sounds, and he redoubled his exertions to
entice a trot from the old cayuse, but in
vain. Wiley Fox soon overtook him,
mounted on a fine horse. As he came up
he asked :
"Is that you, Murray V
"Yes. Is that you, Wiley?"
"Yee; and you had better harry up.
They are aft^r us." m
"1 can't hurry."
"Why not?"
"Why, the fools have given me an old
ing. If there is the slightest crack or nail
hole tii is sand will filter through in tha
coftrse of a few years, and fill the cgflin
solid. That, of course, hastens the. de- '
composition of the body.
"Where there was protection against
this the remains were found In marty
stages of their return to earth. In many,
instances there were only bones and hair.
The hair was preserved to the last always.
Clothes also lasted very long. In one case
of a woman that had disappeared, ajl but,

seemed in a perfect state of preserva
tion. ..'
"There was one thing that neither time
nor any other condition affected. That was
gold. We found many piece* of 'gold in
the coffinsâ gold ringer-rings, 'gold-cuff
buttons and other jewelry. One man
found $20 gold pieces. They tfert probably
in the pockets of victims of smallpox.dur-.
ing tne epidemic. At that time bodies
were frequently hurried to tbe grave with
out much inspection, wrapped perhaps in
a blanket in which they had died.
"I found a pair of gold sleeve-*bnttons
myself that belonged to a young man who
had come from a town in Massachusetts..
I wrote there hoping or curious to learrn
something of him, but I received no reply.
"in nearly every instance the coffin was
coated on the inside : with a beautiful deli

resuming his work, "I am' of. the opinion

At this point Wiley burst into a, fit of
laughter.
"Murray, you are tbe worst sold man I .
ever saw."
"How so?"
"Why, the confounded merchant isn't

Silently Murray sat and cogitated, then
turned the old cayuse about and'slowiy

SUICIDE OF A CAT
On Wednesday of Ust week a full-grown '
black cat was observed sitting on tbe edge â . .
of the sidewalk on Washington stireot, juit 'â¢
below Battery, and attracting the atten-.
tion of passers by her unrestrained and:
piteous mewing. The proprietor of one of .
the fruitstores of the locality who owned,
the animal said the cat has been suffering .
from toothache for over two days and'nad .
been acting for all that time in the most
distracted manner. For over an *hour â¢'
pussy remained on the sidewalk, when
seeming to have suddenly come to a de
cision it deliberately ran under the feet of .
a team of horses attached to a passing
truck and stopped there. The horses
stood still and the driver's attention be
ing called by the strange actions of the
cat he deliberately struck it with the
whip, which caused the cat to jump to one
side, when the horses proceeded, bnf no
sooner did the truck start again than
pussy ran back under the wheels, which
passed over its neck and thus the cat's
toothache and melodies were stilled for- '
ever. Fifty persons saw the performance
and it was their unanimous opinion that*
the cat committed suicide. m

J~loW Tickets /Ire Scalped
There are no longer any ticket "scalp- ]
â¢ pis." They prefer to be known as ticket
. . brokers, Â£nd under that title all the up-to
" date pasteboard manipulators now trans
.act quasi-legitimate business. Ticket
broking is a i'ar different business from the
old-time scalping. To be a broker re
quires capital and the establishment of
..responsible connections in nearly all of the
principal cities of the United States.
During a recent season of disturbance
, tetween Kansas City and New Orleans
Ottinger of'this- City invested about $20,
--. 000. in tickets of the Kansas City," Fort
... Scott and Memphis road. These were
purchased at the rate of $11 each. When
the trouble was adjusted between the war
ring roads rates went back* to the old fig
ures of $21 50. It is generally the custom
for rpads to redeem all cut-rate tickets
after disagreements have been arranged,
but in this instance, for some unexplained
rerfson, the Kansas City, Fort Scott and
Memphis rotfd has refused to take up the
Ottinger holdings, and he is compelled to
get rid of them as best he can.
But even during times of profound
. peace the broker who has established
himself with good conne.ctions has little
difficulty in - making a comfortable in
come, and this will continue to be the
case 30 long as return tickets are issued at
reduced rates, and local charges are much
higher in proportion than through rates.
A few instances will illustrate how the
brokers can under these conditions, with
some slight risk, it is true, contrive to get
tbe best of the railroads.

bility that the oak stump would have been
cracked, which is not the case. It really
looks as if the partly decayed stump of
the oaK has been the means of absorbing

The stump of the oak is about eight feet

Strange Natural Tunnels
About three miles east of the town of
Ukiah in Mendocino County can be seen
one of the most unusual natural curios in
the State. In a certain spot the crust of
the earth is fairly honeycombed with
natural tunnels, and at the same time is
strong enough to bear the weight of the
heaviest wagon.
The origin of tnis peculiar geological
foundation is a matter that seems to have
escaped the study of the great scientists of
the State, as several well-known men de
clared they had no knowledge of it. In
general appearance the earth appears to
be artificial. It looks almost exactly like
the composition of stone and cement that
j is used by builders when putting in foun
dations. A close examination shows it to
be a mixture of a substance similar to
soapstone and various kinds of gravel.
It is almost impossible to conceive of
the healthy artisan, down to his last $5,
and with no prospect of work at his trade
before him. Such a man can do no better
than get a couple of blankets and start lor
the mountains.
Walking is hard, bat it is no harder than
walking the streets of San Francisco look
ing for work, and a few days are enough
to reach any of the sold-bearing localities,
even though the traveler did not Ret a
single "lift" from some passing farmer.
Between tbe Tehachapi and Shasta
there are thousands of canyons in which
a man can get enough gold to pay all of
his expenses. And, what is more, hun
i dreds of men are doing it, and there is
room for a thousand others. At any point
in the mountains, on any of the branches
of the many rivers that empty into the
San Joaquin Valley, where there is a
gravel bed, there gold can be found ir.
some quantity. To be sure there is some
choice in the locality, but any of thorn is
sure to yield something.
The only implements needed by the
| miner are a pick and shovel and a dipper;
and the only material a little quicksilver,
all of which can be bought for a couple of
dollars, or perhaps less.
Arrived at his destination, on Govern
ment land, tbe miner will first stake out
his claim and then make his sluice-box,
which is a very simple task for any me
chanic, as will be seen when he gets into
the mining country. There is no need for
having paid $67 50 for his pas
sage and having thereby saved $5. The
return portion of the ticket, which now
costs the broker but $52 50, is by prearrange
ment turned over to the San Francisco
broker's correspondent in Chicago. This
entitles the holder to a first-class un
limited trip to San Francisco, and its nom
inal value is 8,72 50. It is probably sold
for $62 50, which saves the passenger $10
and gives the broker a profit of an equal
amount. Thus the return ticket, which
cost the brokers $110, is disposed of for
$120, leaving each $5 as his share of the
profit, while the saving to the two passen
gers has been $15.
Another favorite proposition is that
which offers in the purchase of a through
ticket to Indianapolis via Chicago. This
costs $54. The regular fare to Chicago is
$52 50. The local fare between Chicago
and Indianapolis is $5 50. This deal, there
fore, leaves $4 to be divided between the
broker and the passenger.
A better field still is that opened by the
purchase of a ticket from San Francisco to
Joplin via Denver and Kansas City. This
costs $40 55. The rate to Denver direct is
$35, and to Kansas City $40. The local
rate between Denver and Kansas City is
$17, and between Kansas City and Joplin
$4 30. Thus, by the proper manipulation
of such a ticket there is a margin of $15 75
to apportion between the passengers and
the brokers.
Tickets from San Francisco to Mont*
gomery, Ala., via St. Louis, also offer a
good investment for the brokers. The
rate to Montgomery is $51 60, and to St.
Louis $47 50. The local charge between
these two points is $14 60. The skillful
manipulation, therefore, of a through
ticket would leave $10 50 to be shared be
tween the travelers and the brokers.
It is almost the constant theme of
thought among passenger agents to thwart
the operations of the scalpers, and the
courts are frequently resorted to in the
endeavor to force them out of business.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1896.
how it got into its present form unless at
one time there were mad springs in the
locality. There is good reason to believe
that such is the case, as the numerous hot
water springs near by testify. There is
much of this same substance in the
neighborhood, and it all takes on peculiar
and unusual shapes.
From the appearance of the spot in
question the mixture of mud and gravel
must have roiled down the canyon in a
semi-liquid state, and when the springs
had dried up it solidified. Thu3 it re
mained for years, possibly ages, with the
water from the mountain streams wash
ing over it. But the time came when the
stream cut its way through the crust and
took an underground course.
As soon as the stream had one tunnel
through the stratum of mud and gravel it
gradually cut oat others until several
acres have been undermined. As the
years have gone by tunnels have accumu
lated until the place is a perfect labyriiith.
The accompanying picture show 3 a view
looking npstream. The place where the
water enters the earth is about 1000 feet
away and 40 feet higher.
As these tunnels gradually wash out
the lower ends cave in, so that the open
ings are slowly going upstream. This is a
faster process than one would think, as
the ends of the tunnels have ascended
fifty feet in the last two years.
Of course it is almost impossible to ex
plore these tunnels owing to their small
size and the great danger of caving walls.
Not a day passes but what several tons
fall into the tunnels to close them up.
a shelter of any kind, as the warm weather
at present prevailing makes it comfortable
to sleep out of doors. But should one be
desired it is easy to construct from the
timber in the vicinity. The miner and
prospector has a right to this for the pur
poses mentioned.
To show what an industrious man can
do, it is only necessary to relate the expe
rience of E. Simpson, who is at present
working in a gulch known as Gold Run,
about twelve miles from Redwood in Men
docino County. Bimpson is an engineer
and electrician by trade, but lost his last
job about a year ago "for economic rea
sons." His savings gradually disappeared
and for several weeks he walked tbe
streets without sufficient food, all the
while getting into debt for his room rent.
Last April somebody told him of the
mining business, and after borrowing a
dollar from n good friend he started out.
It took lÂ£> cents to cross the bay, but before
hi 3 money was gone Simpson had walked
almost to Healdsburg, when he got a job
from a rancher. He worked a week, and
again started on his way with $4 and a big
baf: of provisions given him by his em
ployer.
In les* than a wpek Simpson was at work
in Gold Ran. He found a number of
other men there, and they kindly gave
him pointers in the business, and also in
formed him that it was private land and
that he would have to pay the owner a
Peculiar Clay and Gravel Freaks of Nature, Resembling Huge
Stalagmites, Called "The Devil's Den"
UUlah's SKoW flace
Devil's Den is Ukiah's showplace, and a
rftost unujue one it is. Located about five
miles from town in a rocky gorge at the
end of a good road, it ia easy to reach at
all times of the day or night.
This freak of nature is composed of that
queer compound of mud and gravel so
common in the locality. From the ap
pearance of it the compound once filled a
gulch and after hardening has been wash
inaout by the rain ever since.
As in all other cases of washing a gully
was first cut through the center, but un
like clay the substance did not run out
easily, possibly because there was more
stone in one place than another. The re
sult has been that the earth has taken on
the form of stalagmites similar to those
Been in the great caves of Kentucky and
Virginia.
Devil's den covers about four acres and
the stalactites aro all of a cold gray in
color. They vary in sice from 5 feet to 75
feet in height. In many places the forma
tion runs off in ridges, with the stalactites
cropping up at intervals.
At any time of the day Devil's Den ia
pleasing and interesting to look at, but
the people of Ukiah have a habit of illum
inating it on moonlight nights that makes
it like a glimpse of fairyland. A party
will go out well provided with plenty of
fireworks and colored fire and make an
evening of it. When the pyrotechnics are
burned the effect is simply dazzling.
The color of the clay makes it particu
larly sensitive to the colored fire and the
dollar a week for the privilege of working
on it.
The first week Simpson was at work he
made $3, but since that time he has aver
aged over a dollar a day. He says he
never goes beiow 50 cents, and occasion
ally reaches $5.
In the Russian River country dozens of
men were seen last week, and all spoke in
favor of the business.
"Of course," said one, "this is not what
I would be doing if I could help myself.
I used to earn $3 a day as a carpenter, but
that was before we had free trade. Now I
earn from $5 to $8 a week, which beats
nothing all hollow, I can tell you. It don't
cost much to live here. 1 have traps set
for rabbits and small game and keep fish
lines ont in the river all the time. 1 only
have to buy a very few provisions, such as
coffee and bacon. I am in good health
and have really enjoyed the experience.
My family is in the City and I have sent
them $4 or $o every week. I would like to
see them, but I guess I can't until M(.â¢Kin
ley is elected and business improves."
The locality mentioned is really one of
the poorest in the State, and yet it has
been proved that aoy man can make wages
there who will work.
On the headwaters of the San Joaquin
there are dozens of men who average over
$1 50 a day, and a few of them have found
big nugget?. Not long ago a man is said
to have washed out one that weighed $800.

The coquettish handling of a fan has
given birth to volumes of semi-humorous

charms of female loveliness in the eyes of

"Setting her cap at him" is almost a
proverb. But no man or woman writer
haa heretofore attempted to do justice to
the possibilities of the caps of the natty
apprentices who "sail the ocean blue" on
British merchant vessels between this
port and "the tight little island." The
wearers are in that charming age, inter

ground of adolescence. #They are manly
and boyish and appeal to the ladies by
their dashy manner and handsome,

tninly kept hair place a visored blue cloth

tween the visor and the top of the crown,
a bunch of coquettisbly arranged gold
lace with some sort of an emblem, which
the ladies will wonder over and admrre.
The cap is just large enough to be safely

and Roman candles are discharged and
the brilliant li<;!it is reflected from pin

unexpected effects of light ami shade,
then, indeed, is the scene a dazzling one.
Just when the Devil's Den first came
into existence is not known, but it is of
comparatively recent origin and on account
of its ephemeral nature will undoubtedly
soon be a thing of the past. That is, if
our rainy seasons keep up.
Hole ir\ the Qrovirvd
One of the most remarkable holes in the
ground in all California is undoubtedly
one on the Laughlin ranch in Mendocino
County. Not only is it peculiar in itself,
but its opening is whore an explorer would
never look for such a curiosityâ on the top
of a hill.
This freak of nature has been known to
white men for many years, but only six
people have had the temerity to explore it.
It is said that the Mendocino Indians
knew of its existence and once threw a
negro into it for being a fraudulent propheK,
from which tragic circumstance the hole
is Known to the countryside as "Nieger
hole."
It ia not an easy matter to reach this
place from any of ihe towns in the county,
as many miles of bad road have to be tra
versed in order to get anywhere near it.
The last two miles is to the top of the
bill, which rises about 800 feet above the
wagon road.

Chamber of Deputies a tax of one centime

ment, for â¢ instance, would have received
$200 from M. Zola's "Rome" alone.
No one would suspect the hole's exist
ence until they were close enough to look
into it, as the rim is covered with a thick
growth of trees. And even having found
that few would tl)ink it was anything like
it is. because ihe opening really looks like
an ordinary sink-hole in a rocky country.
To descend into this hole it is necessary
to be well provided with ropes and be
something of a gymnast. The rim of the
hole is about twenty-five feet across, but
twenty feet from the surface it narrows
to a hole hardly large enough to crawl
tnrough.
The descent into this mysterious cavern
is a most exciting experience. Thirty feet
from the surface there is a ledge, and the
explorer must hang on to his rope or he
will drop off into space.
The downward descent is a succession of
crawling through rifts in the rocka and
climbing over ledges into gulfs of daru
ness.
The deepest descent into this hole was
made last Saturday, when a party, includ
ing a representative of The Call, reached
a depth of 134 feet from the surface. At
this point there was a ledge of rock, over
which a lantern was lowered about twenty
feet to another ledge. The hole was wider
at this point than at any other, and in the
dim light a third ledge could be seen and
on it a skeleton, but whether of man or
beast could not be ascertained.
From these indications it would seem
that t lie hole was at least 1000 tcet deep,
and possibly has an outlet near the bot
tom. At any rate it is well ventilated, as
the smoke from the burning paper quickly
ascended to the top.
/\r\other
Jteal Sea Serperxt
JKree hundred Feet
orv the Atlantic
Goast
The sea serpent is coming up from southern
waters, traveling slowly along the Atlantic
Coast, occasionally raising his head to correct
any deviation in his course or to make mental
note of his advance toward a cooler clime. At
least such is the statement vouched for by
Captain Voss of the Belgian steamer Sagamore
to the Philadelphia Inquirer.
"When we were oft' Cape Ifatteras Monday
afternoon," said Captain Voss, "the look
out saw a floating object that looked like a
long, black line, far to windward. Thinking
it might be a black-painted spar or other
wreckage I leveled the gins" on the object, and
at first sight was so astonished tnat the glass
nearly dropped from my hand. That it was no
mast or floating spar I became speedily con
vinced, because, instead of being rigidly
straight, it was full of curves, which soemed to
adapt themselves to the rolling motion of the
waves. Never having seen the so-called sea
serpent, and being skeptical of the existence
of such things, I had my curiosity whetted to
learn more of this strange specimen, and con
sequently had the course of the ship altered so
as to bear down upon It.
â¢â¢We were goiner at a good 11-knot gait, and
as nearly as I could judge the serpent was
making between ten and eleven knots an hour,
and heading almost in the same direction
as we were going. At the distance wo were
apart I calculated that night would shut in
before the Sagamore could overtake the mon
ster, and this calculation was made on the as
sumption that his snakeship was then swim
ming at about the top of his speed. Word was
passed down to the engineer not to spare the
coal, and inside of fifteen minutes we were
gaining rapidly upon him.
"Everybody on deck was straining his eyes
to see if we were gaining enough on the mon
ster to enable us to get a close view before
darkness set in.
"All the old opera and spy glasses that had
been idle for months were got out and the
supply, though limited, added to the excite
ment. For a time, to the intense satisfaction
of all, toe serpent seemed to show sign* of
fatigue, and instead of going straight ahead
began to circle around, as if uncertain of his
bearing?. All sorts of plans were suggested
for his capture.
"We were still nbout two miles to the lee
ward of the monster, but every movement was
shortening the distance. The serpent, after
circling around several times, disappeared
from view, only to rise again at a point further
to the eastward. Just then I discovered a lot
of black-looking objects, which I took to be
porpoises, and concluded that the serpent had
suddenly run into a schcol of these fish atjd
Had stopped to leed upon them.
"Just then the sea-serpent reared its gigan
tic head about ten feet above the surface and
displayed the most fierce and ugly-looking
features lever beheld. The creature, in thus
raising its head, gave us the first view of its
actual size, which, as near as I can judge, was
a.bont as large as a flour barrel, with a neck
tapering down to about half that diameter. In
length it appeared to be about 300 feel.
"The serp?nt seemed to have an almost
human look, and its face closely resembled
thatot an apn. The great jaws were bearded
by a heavy growth of what might havo been
hair, but really looted like a mass of seaweed
or black tangled roDes as thick as one's little
finger. The black bisard or mane must have
been over ten feet long, for it still hung in the
water as the strange creature swam twice
in a great circle about ihe place. No more
porpoises could bÂ° seen, a;Â»d, doubtless well
ted, if not tired, the serpent stretched himself
out and lay floating on the water, apparently
fast asleep."

"Not lone; ago a relief" corps was led up
into the garret of a certain Market-street â¢
building to find there a widowed motbe'r, ;
aged, and so feeble that she "could hardly .
move across the room," pray ing at.the side
of her son, who, half crazed with a'burn- â¢

"Indeed, so weak had the mother -be- -

the husband deserted them and sailed to

procure employment in stores and wore
the soles off their shoes in futile tramping
about in quest of work. They could get
nothing to do. They could not descend to
beggary or worse* and so for days they
lived on breadcrusts and water. They bad
suicide in contemplation. The youngest -
daughter had the look of death in her
eyes and the mother's pride was conquered
at last. One night she appeared at the .
barracks and in a weak voice, sobbing now >
and then, unfolded her story. Sad plight,
of course, but there ar* many like it.
People who have seen better times suffer

The mother and daughters I spoke of
needed only a littlo assistance, for the
girls happily found remunerative work to
do shortly alter their meeting face to face
with the grim ghost of starvation. "

I hare spoken in this series of articles of
the pleasure and benefit to be derived from
walking. By this Ido not mean the thing
we know as pedestrianism, although that
is a good, meaningful word and once sig
nified what I have here called walking.
As a general thing this is a form of ex
ercise to which Americans, and in partic
ular Californians, are not much given. On
this coast the cable and the electric car
have succeeded so closely upon the heels of
the vanishing horse that San Francicans
may almost be said never to have known
the necessity for walking.
Then, too, we have permitted the hills
of our City, which ought to invite and in
cite us to scale their heights on foot, to
.' repel us and drive us instead, to being
dragged up on an endless rope. Walking
up hill is, in reality, a useful and should
b.e a pleasant form of exercise. It de
velops, at one and the same time, muscles,
lung power, a graceful cairiage and alight
step. This always presuming that one
walks rightly. As a matter of fact, how
ever, few of us do walk rightly. Women
â  are especially unskillful in this firm of ex
ercise. This is due in part to hampering
skirts, impossible shoes and a barricade
about the muscles of waist and hips, but
a good deal is also due to ignorance.
In an article on West Point The Call
published a Sunday or two ago appear
â¢ two picturesâ one oi "The Cadet," another
of "The Candidate'â which illustrates,
capitally, how to stand and how not to.
Tell the average man or woman to stand
â  up straight and be or she will throw the
weight upon tbe heels, hollow in tbe
- back, thrust forward the abdomen, crane
â  tbe neck and remain thus poised until, in
pity, you do something to break the un
pleasant spell in which your request
.seems to involve the victim. If women
really desire to walk, and not to roll or
waddle or squirm, as so many of them do,
there are a few facts that they must bear
in mind.
First and foremost is the fact that the
foot, and not the heel, should carry the
weight of the body. Second, that the
. head, and not the abdomen, should be the
first division of the human anatomy to
impress itself upon the beholder's atten
tion. Yet, usually, the latter division
comes first through a door. lam aware
that this statement is unpleasant, but the
â¢ living reality is far more so, and worse, in
that while the statement is almost inev
itable in verity, the reality may easily be
obviated. Stand upon the balls of the
feet, with the spine well erect and the chin
drawn in so that the eyes look straight
ahead upon a steady level. You will
find that tbe lower part of the torso
immediately withdraws into retiracy.
You will find, moreover, upon practicing
" the position, a decided relief to strained
muscles and ligaments, long overworked
by wrong standing. You will be able to
stand longer and with less fatigue if you
stand thus.
. How, walking should maintain the
erect, straightforward position, but in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred it does '
not. To illustrate from the lower animals, I
most men and women walk like cows, j
â¢â¢' when they should walk like horses. Study I
these two creatures, and you will see what j
I mean. The horse brings h'n hind fcot j
forward on a direct line with the front
foot on tbe same side, but tbe cow brings
her hind foot around rather than forward,
in a little outward swing which makes her
method of locomotion slow and lumbering
beside that of the quick, .trimly stepping
horse. Watch, now, almost any man who
has had none of the military training that
is doing so much for our young men, and
you will note that he, too, brings forward
each foot in a slightly outward variation
from a straight line.
Faulty footwear is the principal cause
of this ugly, shuffling gait, which is even
â¢ commoner among women than with men.
â¢ The toothpick shoe, known abroad as "the
American shoe" and among us as "the
â  â¢ Piccadilly," has other faults than deform
ing the feet. It throws the weight too
much upon the heels, for the cramped
toes and ball of the foot cannot sustain it.
Then, owing to the position the body
assumes in standing, the tread cannot
! possibly be even. Heel and sole soon
wear a trifle on the outside â "run over."
; we call it â and the knee, thigh and hip
; are thus thrown out of line. Wben this
occurs the strained muscles cannot bring
the foot directly forward, but swing it out
, ward at every stride, bringing it down in
the flat, inelastic tread which distin
guishes most of us women.
In a majority of cases, too, the muscles
! of the waist are prevented from acting
i freely by the restraining corset, which
accentuates the hips as they roll and rise
in the attempt at locomotion.
This picture is not in the least over
drawn. What I have described may be
noted in any block of any street of our
City. And it is folly to assert that the
corset does not restrain the action of waist
muscles. There are two strong, thick
muscles running one each side of tbe
spine, the office of which is explained by |
their name, the erector spinse.
These muscles should maintain the
spine upright, but in tbe back of the \
woman who has worn corsets for any j
length of time they are seen to be wasted
and weakened about the waist, not neces- â 
sarily because the corset is tight, but be- j
cause it has afforded an artificial support,
andthe muscles, not being called upon to
do their full share of work, grow weak in |
idleness, as does every unused organ or
muscle. They play a prominent part in
locomotion as do also the abdominal mus
cles, which are similarly hampered and
weakened, and as a consequence their
failure to act produces a weak, dragging
gait as well as a shuffling and inelegant one.
As though our constant defects of loco
motion were not enough we have, just at
present, a number of affectations of gait
that serve to accentuate and increase j
them. When you see a young man in j
wide trousers, cutaway coat, high collar !

Learns to Become
A Qood Walker
My subject this week will be on heel
and-toe walking. As far as health is con
cerned there Is no more invigorating exer
cise than to go out on the track and put
in a mile or two as a pedestrian.
"Fairness" in heel-and-toe walking con
sists of two principles and a few minor
considerations. Unless these are carefully
observed the athlete will iead a wretched
existence.
First and most important one foot must
always be on the ground. This can be illus
trated by taking a pair of scissors and
opening them balf-way, or until about an
inch and a half separates the points.
Plant both points on a table and then
sway the scissors back and forth, raising
first one point and then the other, always
keeping one point on tbe table. In fair
walking one foot must always be kept on
the groundâ tliat is, before the toe of the
foot in the rear is lifted the heel of the
one in front must be on the track.
There must not be an instant when
both feet are in the air like a runner's,
however instantaneous it may be. Such
a trick is known as "lifting," and is prac
ticed by some unprincipled men with a
certain amount of success until they carry
it too far, v,hen they are promptly dis
qualified by the judge. This feature of
unfair walking is the easiest for an honest
walker to detect in himselfâ not that it is
easy to do so, for I have known many a
walker with the best of intentions to be
deceived; but I mean that of all the char
acteristics of unfair walking this one can
be watched with some measure of success
by one's self.
The next point in unfair walking is
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1896.
rate of ten knots an hour, his knees sin king
at every stride, swinging his cane far in
advance of him at each Ftep, planting it
firmly upon the sidewalk and then hauling
himself up to it, as it were, do not make
the mistake of thinking he is practicing
for a cake walk. He is. only doing the
Harvard dip, which seems to be having a
revival ont here.
Like unto it, in elegance, is what some
one has dubbed the bicycle walk of the
1 utterly correct young woman. This, too,
i comes to us from the cultured East, but
some Of our girls have got it very pat.
The bicycle walker carries a closed para
sol in both hands, grasping it exactly as
one grasps the bandies of a bicycle. The
head is held well forward, the body
slightly bent and the eyes regard futurity
with a fixed and stony stare. The sight
is a beautiful one, and not to be forgotten.
Then there Is tbe young woman who
I wears a sailor hat and stiff collar, puts her
umbrella under her arm and swaggers;
the girl 'who carries her shoulders high
and strides along with elbows at right
angles to her body, and the girl who walks
with her shoulders, rotating first one then
the other side of her body as though they
are two separate entities that she is tow
ing along by the main force of her un
aided will.
A little more will forco would not be a
| bad thing for most of us in walking. In
! fact, the two qualities most desirable in
| locomotion might be said to be directness
and self-control.
These, for promoting a graceful carriage,
! are worth all the technical rules for walking
1 that can be laid down.
To have the body so trained and clad
I that it is a usable instrument for the work
! demanded of it; to hold it erect, step
i squarely and truly upon the foot; to bring
j the chin well in, so that the glance ahead
j is level, and to carry each foot forward in
a straight line, with a free forward move
ment of the thigh and a supple bend of
j the ankle, are the essentials to a good walk.
No woman wearing a long skirt and de
siring to appear graceful should walk
rapidly. The three things cannot be done
at once. Fortunately a time seems com
ing when we need not attempt them. The
short bicycle skirt has taught women the
comfort of freedom in country and hill
walking. In the East a great many
women have adopted them for rainy-day
costumes, and it is quite likely tbat an
other rainy season on this coast may see
our women better equipped for it than
they have ever been before.
Penelope Powelson.
bending the knee. No one can walk
fairly that does not keep his knees stiff.
If you observe closely you will see that
the knee does not need to be bent much.
Even men with long legs can get along
with very little bend.
You have seen two men walking along
in a hurry, trying to catch a train, per
haps. One man will be faster than the
other, and you will notice that tbe slower
man, after walking as fast as he can for a
dozen steps, will suddenly break into a
series of skips half way between a run and
a walk. He keeps this up for only half a
dozen steps, when he settles back in a
walk, oniy to repeat the operation twenty
yards further on.
Now that man is "lifting," and he does
not know it, possibly. The strain upon
his hips to keep his knees stiff and swing
his legs back and forth has been more
than he could bear, and, what must not
be forgotten, he found himself falling
behind. He found that bending his
knees a trifle and jumping from his toes,
instead of taking a long, stiff-knee stride,
was easier and assisted the locomotion.
The stride should be taken by the power
of the muscles of the hip and the calf of
tbe lee â not by the use of the muscle run
ning from the groin to the knee. When
tbe latter is used iook out for the j udge of
walking, for if he understands his business
he will warn or disqualify you.
When a person falls into the habit of
"lifting" he is in a bad way, not only be
cause he is liable to incur the displeasure
of the judge of walking, but because half
tbe time he will be unconscious of the fact.
This, to say nothing of other causes, is
what gives rise to so much trouble be
tween judges and contestants. In 1887 I
was asked by the games committee of the
old National Association to act as judge of
walking at the championship games. In
the three-mile race was a man named
Clarke, a noted English walker. Before a
mile wa3 walked I realized that whatever
Mr. Clarke's style may have been in the
old country it would not pass in tfcese
United States. Walking up to him as he
was passing I remarked:
"I'm sorry to say, Mr. Clarke, that your
right knee is badly bent and you will have
to correct it." I was truly sorry for the
fellow, as I knew that he would have to
come off the track sooner or Aater if I did
my duty. He looked at me as though he
did not understand or did not care, and if
he improved at all it certainly did no* last
long. I soon found it necessary to repeat
my warning, but it was received with the
same stony stare. As he continued to
walk with his left knee and shoulder sink
ing at every stride ("walking with one leg
and running with the other," as it is
called) I notified him that he was disqual
ified. The only recognition that I re
ceived was a drawl that sounded like
"Nal" He continued his course, and
when I notified him a second time I re
ceived the same sneering reply.
But more than that, a large proportion
of the occupants of the side stand, who had
a grudge against the man who was winning
the race, took his quarrel, and though thay
were fully aware that I had served a long
apprenticeship at the business, saw fit to
jeer me for my onfair decision. The next
day two or three papers took up the cause
of the abused Englishman and scored me
roundly. However, a hush suddenly fell
over the scene, when on tbe following Sat
urday the New York Sun came out with
news that the papers who had abused me
did not care to publish. It seems that in a
walk that occurred one week after tbe
games in question the said Mr. Clarke was
disqualified by the foremost judge of walk
ing in America. In the same article the
Sun vindicated my decision.
In the case of Clarke, he was troubled
with one of the commonest forms of im
perfect walking. The trouble arises from
a number of causes. Some that may be
mentioned are weakness of the knees,
weakness of tbe muscles, lack of care, lack
of proper instruction and shortness of the
sinews.
A man may have had an accident when
a boy, from which he has never truly re
covered; and the limp which has never
intruded itself under ordinary circum
stances appears like an unwelcome guest
at the feast. Sontetimes the muscles are
not strong enough, or the vital force is in
sufficient to keep the knees stiff. The
principal reason, however, is Jack of
proper attention on the part of the athlete
or his instructors. Possibiy he has no in
structor; in that case he is simply unfor
tunate; particularly unfortunate because
the judge has no right for any reason to
observe clemency.
The analysis of tbe matter simply is
that when the pedestrian starts out fresh
and strong he has no difficulty in pulling
his knees stiff; but after he has covered a
quarter of a mile, all unconscious to him
bis knees, or rather the extensor muscles,
begin to get tired. Then the judge
notices that his knees begin to sag, be
cause the tight cord under the knee is pull
ing, and no matter how slight it may be
the official cannot tolerate it, however
great a regard he may have for the integ
rity of the contestant. He will get a "cau
tion," at which he will straighten his knee
for a while by an effort. This will not
last long, and he will get another caution.
If be ia wise, he will leave the track and
avoid disqualification, for, if he has the
difficulty of which I have been speaking,
that fate awaits him if the judge is com
petent and strict.
There are a few minor points pertaining
to unfair walking. Stand in the center of
the field and watch to see whether a man's
head is level as he passes along. A per
fectly fair walker could walk along with a
platform built half an inch above his head
and not wear his hair off, because his
head will travel on an even keel, as tbe
sailors say. On the contrary, If he is
afflicted with the bad knees referred to the
crown of his head will travel in an undu
lating course, following a line like the
swell of the ocean. If one knee is "off"
that shoulder will sink down at every
stride, and give the appearance of limp
ing. If the arms are jerked and not
swung smoothly, it is probably. caused by
jumping along from toe to heel, and the
elbows are used to assist the improper
mode of progression.
I have just mentioned the arms, and as
these are very important features of walk
ing we will talk more about them. The
upper limbs can do a great deal toward as
sisting or interfering with style and speed.
An improper way of holding the arms is
to swing them diagonally across the chest;
this positively interleres with progres
sion.
Then the method referred to a moment
ago of jerking is very bad. The proper
way is to swing them back and forth as
follows: Mark a spot on the track eight
feet in front of you. Stand still and swing
your arms in such a manner that the
wrists will cross in line with your eyes
and the spot indicated. Having fixed this
in your mind begin to walk and observe
the same rule. The hands should be used
to assist the stride by helping the body on
ward, but too much care cannot be observed
not to lift the feet off the ground. This is
a danger point if the walker is not ex
tremely careful.
It is the little things that count in walk
ing â more so, perhaps, than In most ath
letic exercises. Therefore I will give a
few hints on these small questions.
Keep the head erectâ not strained too
far back or allowed to sink on the
breast.
This should be carefully observed for two
easons, because it is likely to tire one
intil the aching in the neck draws the at
ention from tbe vital point at issue, the
ace, and because it looks wretched and
ipoils what migbt be otherwise a fine
ityle.
Carry cigar-shaped corks in the hands,
and do not grip them in the fists as you
would the handle of an umbrella on a
windy day, but hold them diagonally,
with the thumb resting Â«n the small end,
the fingers overlapping each other as they
clasp the cork. This is more graceful than
grabbing it, which makes the hand look
larger and more awkward.
Bo not make an effort to swing the hips.
Nature will take care of that for you with
out resorting to unnatural means. As
you improve the stiffness in the joints will
gradually disappear, the hips will limber
up, and after a time your friends will tell
you that you are taking a longer stride.
Avoid ' jerks in every way. If your
friends are not competent to judge your
I walk they can at tell you whether
| your style is smooth and even, and free
| from jerks. Tell them to watch your head,
| arms, hips, knees and feetâ these are the
j vital points in walkingâ and tell you if
, there are evidences of hitching, jumping,
| limping or jerking of any descrip
i tion.
More than any other class of athletes a
walker should be graceful. Not that it is
imperatively necessary, but it is most de
sirable. Geobge D. Baird.

Of all the recent inventions pertainnig
to bicycles there is one that is simply
charming. It is an arrangement whereby
tbe same power which drives the bicycle
also sets in motion a music- box which is
attached to tbe machine.
The music-box is attached to the front
forks and the operation is carried on by
means of a cord passing over a small pul
ley in the box and around one of larger
size fastened to the spokes. It is said that
the wheel is in great demand for serenad
ing and running about town on pleasant
evenings. Since the inventor has inserted
the "Daisy Bell" cylinder he says he has
had an increased demand for tandems.
The inventor, by the way, is J. W.
Banks, who lives in lowa. He says that
his idea is tbe greatest of the century, be
cause it widens the field of bicycling to a
degree that is almost alarming. He points
out that with the music-box arrangement
the racing man will be able to make
greater speed, because the music will en
thuse him,
For the road rider there could be noth
ing better, according to the way in which
Mr. Banks looks at it. If the spirits or
the muscles of the scorcher should flag
when on the homeward journey all he
would have to do would be to hook up the
arrangement and have music that would
be inspiring and make him feel like a new
man.

The remark is often heard, "Girls are
taking men's plates." That pbrase is
often wrongly used. When a girl takes a
place, does the same work for the same
wages as a man would gee, she lakes no
man's place. It is her own. But when a
girl takes a place where some man used to
make a living, and does his work with
equal excellence for one-third or one-half
the wages, she is taking his place and he
and all the men engaged in the same line
of work have a cause for a grievance
against her.
In strict justice she has no right to this
in the present condition of society, which
is anything but justice, it seems a neces
sity.
Perhaps when girls are taught the prin
ciples of political economy they may
realize that this partly subsidized labor is
wrong. They certainly do not now. 1
have talked to them often and found only
the densest ignorance.
That it is wrong to do a man's work for
$4 a week is too deep for the cirl who can
live at home and have all the $4 for Docket
money. That the cook in the kitchen is
more independent and occupies a position
more honorable seems to her only an
insult.
They are forced into it, too, if home Is
crowded and the head of the family can
not provide enough for all. The $4 or $5
seems a great help. It is one of those de
ceitful helps that really hinder by mak
ing the labor of other workers worth
lees.
It is useless to explain to a struggling
family that this cut in wages that gives
employment to one of its members cuts
the difference off the wages of thousands
of other people. Present need blots out
the sight of the future reaction.
An anxious mother will offer the ser
vices of her son in office or store for a pit
tance just to keep him off the street.
Does she see the selfishness, the inhuman
ity of it? To save herself a little worry, or
to shift the consequence of her careless
raising, she makes the family man at the
next desk work for a pittance too.
In the professions this conflict of the
sexes has made as yet no difference. The
woman physician and the man are paid
alike, tbe teacheris paid regardless of sex,
and the writer is paid for what she does,
not for what she is.
These women are educated to see the
error of offering their services at a dis
count, and when men learn that to com
pel a girl to take less than would be
offered a man is to make the next man ac
cept the same, there will be less jealousy
when a woman does receive good wages.
It ought not to crowd out one worker if
another joins the ranks. Things work in
a circle. The more earned, the more will
be spent. The more produced by labor,
the more labor ought to be able to afford
to use.
The merchant says he cannot afford
more clerks because he does not sell more
goods.
Tbe worker says if he could have con
stant employment he would have more
clothes and better food. One condition
would produce the other. There ia some
thing all wrong.
Another opening can be found for the
musical bicycle. There is a possibility
that it may relieve the fond father from
the necessity of getting up during the
night and walking the floor with the cry
ing baby. All pa would have to do under
those circumstances would be to get his
bicycle upstairs from the lower hall.
Taking the baby in his arms he could then
mount the bicycle ...id begin to ride around
the room.

On the Street
Who Kr\eW His Rights
The world over there is a well-recognized
rule that gives pedestrians the right of
way, but in San Francisco only a few of
those who drive horses respect it. There
are some people who occasionally stand
upon their rights and assert them. That
was the case on Market street, opposite
Mason, on Friday last. An elderly, well
dressed man, whose white hair gave him a
patriarchal mien, was crossing the street,
when a youth, behind a bay horse hitched
to a delivery wagon, drove along at break
neck speed.
The old gentleman saw him and stood
as fitm as a statue. The youngster saw
him, too, and by hard tugging reined up
within a foot of the old gentleman. "Why
in St. Paul don't you get out of the way?"
yelled the driver. The party addressed
neither moved nor answersd. Behind this
team came another and then others, and
cars, until there was a procession extend
ing down to Powell streetâ a regular
blockade. The driver repeated his question
and the old gentleman, waving his hand
as he stepped aside, said: "Young man,
I only wanted to teach you a lesson ; drive
on, but not too fast."
The pictures of childlife in The Sunday
Call, while true and startling, are illus
trations of a wrong.
It is not from among the children raised
in the midst of great wealth, with no care
or thought for the morrow, that will come
our statesmen, teachers, inventors, sages.
It is rare indeed that a man or a woman
from the very rich class really does any
thing. They have power, the power that
comes from wealth, and from it may gain
civil and social honors, but they lack tbe
incentive to bring forth the best that is in
them, that comes from the necessity of
self-advancement. The very wealth, with
its burdens and obligations of caste,
dwarfs and narrows them.
Fathers toil and mothers deny them
selves that money may be left to children
to sap their intelligence and ambitions
and turn them into elegant idlers.
The surest and most honorable inheri
tance is tbe ability to use bands and head
to some purpose and the expectation and
the will to do something.
The dainty darlings on the one hill will
never do as much nor in truth amount to
as much as the ragged urchins on the
other hill. But both extremes are wrong,
the result of a deep-seated mistake some
where in the social system. Extremes are
always nnnatural.
It is not from either of these types we
must look for our citizens of to-morrow,
but in the strata which lie between.
It is the sturdy middle class that counts;
the class that is being drawn more and
more to one extreme or the other, to
riches or poverty. The land which has
most of its people in that middle class of
comfortable workine families is in no
danger of revolutions.
Every person on earth is worth enough
to supply his bodily wants and a rest in
his age, and no pereon is worth more than
be can or will use or a hoard to leave be
hind.
No person with strength has a right to
an idle Jife, and if all were workers, instead
of crowding one another we would all be
ablÂ« to enjoy the whole fruits of our labor.
I wish I need not see so much to con
demn in the growing girl of to-day. Not
that my condemnation is anything: it is
the facts that are something.
On the streets late at night when those
whose labor will allow them are forgetting
the cares of the day and in sleep finding
new strength for the morrow girls and
boys are loitering. Not girls who must be
out, but the happy ones with homes and
comforts. They are out for fun, in groups
and couples, at the corners and the gates
until near the midnight hour. Doing no
harm, perhaps, just now, with tneir whis
pering and giggling, but growing away
from their womanly dignity and sweet
ness. In that evening converse is not one
word of common-sense; indeed, "Jimmie
and Mag" will say weightier things.
Mothers do not realize how little they
really know of what goes on behind that
smooth white forehead that seems inno
cence itself. Did you ever listen to the
talkâ one cannot call it conversationâ of a
group of schoolgirls? It is not edifying;
tianot encouraging. "He" is most of it!

all be a failure.
"He" represents the universe, and ''what .
I said to him, and what he said to me
that jnade me nearly die laughing" is '
what the world turns on.
And "He" ! Such a dear, curly little he,
with banes and a weak mouth.
Better the athletic girl, with her never- *
ending talk of sports; better the girl lull
of the real ana imaginary wrongs of her
sex, than the girl with her mind full of
that baby-faced nothing.
Boys do not talk often or "long about â 
"she." If "she" is mentioned wifcn free
dom "she" has forfeited respect. It is rfo â¢
compliment to have one's name, used'
familiarly among the boys. Girls love to
talk over the boys they like best, but boys "
shrink from speaking of a very nice girl.
Their talk may not be wise or witty, never
theless the subjects have wider range. " .
While so much is being said and done to
save our boys tnere is a crying need -to
save our girls; the girls sheltered in happy
homes, as well as the girls who must earn .
their daily food.
It helps, it strengthens, it ennooles a
girl to know she must learn something â 
weU enougb to earn her own living by it; â¢
and the lesson is not complete until she
has earned it. With that self-reliant inde
pendence she measures the men of her ac
quaintance, and feels no need to marry
the first one who offers for fear she majf â¢
never have another chance. Bhe" can af
ford to wait till the real prince cornea
along and then, so long as women are .
women, she will lay down her- task and
follow anywhere.
More than half of the failures in mar- â¢
riage comes from lack of this independ-.
ence, or from a hasty raarriaee to escape
the restraints of home or- the toil thaj. is
irksome. After a year the old home life
seems all freedom, the old toil all rest.. '
Instead of crying that marriage is going
out of fashion better be more careful and.
make it possible for divorce to go out of
fashion.
Girls are aping more an* more the
dress and pursuits of boys, and boys are
growing more and more like girls in looks. '
One night as I sat in a th#ater 1 could "
look across and catch the profile of a score
of college boys in one row, just the side of
the face and head. At rust I thought they
were girls and was struck with the pretty
effect without hats. Wavy hair parted in
the middle falling low over the white"
brow, pink cheeks and refined features. â¢
They have a perfect right to do it and the"".
result i% very pretty, only do. not -be so
hard on the sisters who are trying to per
petuate the more rugged type.
In the German class of the U. C. I used
to watch Mr. A.'s lovely hair. It fell on,"
each side in such soft waves. I grudged
him that hair when I was spending pre
cious, time trying to keep my own straight
locks in curl. But one day it rained. It
rained a soft, warm rain and the windows
were left open.
Mr. A. was deep in Schiller and forgot
to move from his place by the window.
The damp air floated in and touched those
envied waves. They began to straighten.
They straightened clear out and hung in
liltletags. I wonder why?

JACK'S
POKEVILLE
"What amuses you, Jack?" said the head
bookkeeper, as he looked up from his big
ledger and mw a smile on the boy's face
opposite.
;"Iâ l just landed a fire- pound bass,' said
Jack, laughing and blushing a little.
"Urnâ ah, did it puli very bard?"
â¢â¢Fearful," said Jack.
All through the year Jack had been sav
ing the money for his trip. He was assist
tant bookkeeper for Brown, Bridges &
Bros., where he bad been since graduating
>om the commercial college two years be
" are.
Jack was an orphan. Tbe small means
-eft him by his parents had been exhausted
"> lore his education had been completed,
oo that his first year's savings he had used
:o repay money advanced to him by an
:ncle to complete his course.
H is savings this year he was investing
in building stock, with the exception of $1
-.veekly, which he put aside for no other
uirpose than a trip to the bass streams or
he Alleghanies.
All through the dark winter days, as he
pondered over the long rows of figures, he
.iad paused now and then to muse for a
â noment of green mountains, blue skies,
:iear, rushing water, and feel in imagina
tion the tug and swish of a taut line and
:he rapid click of the running reel. Then
iis eyes would sparkle for a moment and
ie was no longer in the dim and dusty
.ittle office.
He had calculated that the $52 would
7>ay his expenses. He had figured it out
â¢vsr and over and knew the items by
heart.
There were excursion rates to the
mountains and his round-trio ticket
7,-ould cost him $12. Then there was his
board at a farmhouse, which he calculated
r.t $20. He could get a good rod, reel and
line for $10, and for general items he al
lowed $10 more.
That night as they closed the books the
head bookkeeper said to him:
"Jack, have you been to see Harris
lately?"
"No," said Jack, "but I will go to-night.
How is he?"
"Not very well, poor fellow; he doesn't
â mprove very much, I'm afraid. The city
now is so hot, you know, and the doctor
nays the dust and smoke are bad for him.
He. coughs a good deal, and you know
what that leads to."
Tom Harris had been their shipping
clerk. He was a tender-hearted, good
ratured fellow, whom Jack had always
liked for his outspoken, friendly way.
He was not very strong, however, and

one day during the winter had contracted
a severe cold, terminating in pneumonia.
This attack be had overcome, but it had
left him very weak and with a disagreeable
cough.
His mother, a widow with a small posi
tion, had found it a hard matter to live
without her son's assistance, although
Tom's employers had generously assumed
his drugs and doctor bills, while the em
ployes from time to time sent or carried
such books and delicacies aa he could en
joy.
Jack had visited him pretty regularly
until the last few weeks, during which
time the prospect and preparation for bis
outing had occupied his evenings almost
to the exclusion of everything: else.
After supper Jack went to the market
and filled a basket with fresh, ripe fruit.
Then he hurried off to atone for his neg
lect.
By and by he climbed three flights of
stairs to a close little flat where Mrs. Har
ris and her son lived.
Tom was overjoyed to see him, and the
tender-hearted fellow choked a little as he
thanked him for the fruit. Jack sat down
by him, and they talked of matters at the
store, and the spirits of both rose as Jack
told some amusing things that had hap
pened lately.
"You know young Bridges is doing your
work," he said, langhing.
"Yes, you told me," replied Tom, with
a little sigh.
"Well, he doesn't like it Tery well, but
his father wouldn't get anybody in yonr
place. He said Charlie could just as well
do it till you came back. He had lots of
trouble at first, but gets along pretty well
now. He's not a bad fellow, either, but
an awful dandyâ wears a silk nat and
pa f ent leathers."
"Yes, I know, and I recollect once he
fell down in the mud and came into the
office nearly crying."
"Yesâ wellâ and you know big Jim, the
drayman?"
"Oh, yes; Jim has been to see me twice.

she says : 'Jim,' says she, 'take this 'ere

an, she says, 'Jim,' says she, 'you will

an' to 'is ma, likewise.' It's wicked for
me to imitate Jim, but I was so glad to
hear him talk again that I wanted to cry
and laugh at the same time."
Jack laughed, too. till the tears came.
"But I was going to tell you about Char
lie Bridges," he said. "The other evening
Jim was waiting for him to make out
some shipping receipts, and went over in
the corner, where it's kinder dark, you
know, to sit down on on the stool there.
Well, just as he plumped himself down he
felt something pop and squash under him
and jumped up like he was shot. It was
Charlie's silk hat. Everybody laughed
except Jim and Charlie. Jim was awful
sorry and offered to pay for it, while Char
lie shed tears, but refused the money.
The boys liked him the better for that, and
he and Jim are as good friends as ever."
Tom laughed so heartily that he began
coughing in a way that cut Jack to the
heart. His mother brought him some
water, and when his cough was quieted
Jack had grown sad and silent.
"What is the doctor doing for you?" he
asked, after a long pause.
"Not much, now," said Tom, a little
sadly. "He cays 1 need fresh air most,
and that if I could get strength my cough
would stop."
Jack continued to look grave and offered
no reply.
"I must try and get back to work by Oc
tober," continued Tom. "Just-think, I have
lost eight whole months; it is terrible,"
and teiÂ«rs stood in the poor fellow's eyes.
â¢'Where would you go for an outing, old
boy? ' asked Jack, after a pause.
"Oh, I don't know; I haven't considered
it. Almost any place in the country
where I could get away from this smoke
and have fresh air. Yes, there is a place,"
he added. "It's where we used to live be
fore we came to the city," and he glanced
quickly at bis mother, who bent low over
her sewing and did not seem to be listen
ing.
"I should like to go there. It is about
fifty miles north of here, and there are
nice woods and a little stream, where I
used to catch perch and chub. I should
like to go there again and fish. I know
people there, too, and I don't believe it
would cost more than $15 a month for
board," and the sick man's eyes shone at
the thought of his old Tillage and the
stream with its perch and chub.
An hour before Jack would have laughed
scornfully at such sport, but he did not
laugh now. Pretty soon he said good
night to Tom and his mother and walked
home under the street lamps thinking.
That night when he got to his room he
made a new calculation. It ran as fol
lows:
Thre* round-trip tickets to Pokeville $6 00
Board for three, one month 45 00
Fish-lines and hooks tor perch and chubs. ... 1 00
Totals 952 00
Then he wrote a little note.
"Dear Tom," it said, "I am going to
take a vacation in September, and as I
will waut company I invite you to go with
me ; also your mother, to take care of us.
I have been saving the money tor a year,
and I have enough for a month's trip for
all of us. You can prepare to start next
week. I will come up to-morrow night
and will talk it over. Jack."
Jack Brainerd never spent a happier
month in his life than that which he spent
with Tom and his mother at Pokeville.
Tom seemed to get better from the first
day, and betore tbe month was over was
thoroughly himself again. Mrs. Harris
visited her old friends, while the young
men spent whole days in the woods, some
times fishing, sometimes just lying be
neath the big trees. When they returned
to the city the hot, dusty weather was
over, and they went back to work bronzed
and strong, and ever since then they have
been inseparable friends.

THE STORIES OF THE PICTURE
A TRUE STORY.
I am a little tree-toad and live among some
bushes in a back yard of East Oakland. Once
I started to take a walk around the yard, but
a big, big giant came along and caught me.
He reached up aud pickins; a twig off a tree
put me on it and then said, "I'll take him into
the house." We entered a pretty room, and he
put me into a glass ball, which 1 have since
learned was a fish globe. Over the top he
stretched a piece of mosquito netting, so I
couldn't get out. Pretty soon a whole lot more
giants came and stared and stared at me. My,
how they frightened me! I wanted so to hide
away from tneir big shiny eyes, but I couldn't,
so I kept still and thought about how I could
get out of that Rlippery prison, and during the
night I did succeed in moving the cover so I
could hop out! I had to lie still in a corner all
night, but when the door was opened I jumped
away, and they have never caught me again.

A LITTLE HELPER.
"Oh, auntie, if I could only do something
to help mamma," cried Dottie Gray. "She
works to hard to make a living, and she is
never very well. Tea can help a good deal,"
Dot added. "He gets wood ana water, builds
the fires and does many other things," and
tear* began to trinkle down Dottle's rosy
cheeks.
Aunt Chloe looked up from the pastry she
was making for pies and stared right in the
little gill's tear-stained face. "I blevÂ°s yo do
â want to help, honey," she said. "Law, chile,
yo could cook."
"Ob, Aunt Chloe, will you teach me?"
"Recon I will. Dere, you go long aud roll out
dat dough and I show yo how to make de pie."
Dottie was delighted. She worked earnestly
for two hours rolling dough, paring apples and
doing other odd jobs to help Chloe.
She went home very light-hearted. Mrs.
Gray wondered what had made her little
daughter so happy.
The next aay she spent another two hours in
learning to cook. At the end of three weeks
Dottie could cook a meal "worth eating," aa
Chloe expressed it.
She had not told her mother that she was
taking cooking lessons.
One Friday Mrs. Gray had a headache and
Dot had to stay at home from school. She
thought it time to show her mother what she
could do, so after bathing her mother's fore
head in cold water until she went to sleep Dot
slipped quietly down to the kitchen, put on
her dust cap and clean white apron and
washed her face and hands. After that she
took a pan of peas to shell for dinner out under
the shade of the house to decide which duck to
kill for her mother's lunch. There was Ring,
Tim, Tom, Blackie and Snowball. Which
should it be? She didn't like to part with any
of them.
Suddenly a thought flashed through her
mind. "I'll throw a handful of peas on the
ground and the duck that gets tue first pea
shall die." Down went the peasl every duck
made a dash to get some, but aias for dear lit
tle Snowball got the first.
8o Snowball was killed and cooked to a
golden brown. When everything was ready,
Dot with a hot, red face went softly to her
mother's room. "Are you awake, mamma,
dear?" she asked. "Yes, daughter," answered
her mother, "and my headache is all gone."
"Then come down to dinner, I cooked it all
by myself," cried Dot, her large blue eyes
sparkling with delight. "You, Dot? you cook?"
exclaimed Mrs. Gray in surprise as she fol
lowed her to' the dining-room, where she saw
the table nicely set, chairs in place, and a hot
steaming dinner all ready.
Mrs. Gray sank in a chair as she said: "Now
Dottie, explain yourself. Who cooked the din
ner? Has any one been here?"
"I cooked the dinner and no one has been
here," exclaimed Dot; then she told her mother
how she had learned to cook, and a merry dinner
they had. Mrs. Gray declared the roast duck
was the best she had ever eaten ana the pies
delicious. Dot agreed with these sentiments
by a nod of her curly head. "Now mamma,
you shan't work so hard anymore. I'll ao all
the cooking after this. You shall rest," said
Dot proudly.
Mrs. Gray answered by a loving kiss on
Dottle's soft red cheek. Cj.aba Elkins.

PATTY AND HER DUCKS.
"Patty, Patty," called mamma, one morning.
"The little ducks are hatched." Patty
scrambled out of bed in a hurry and dressed
herself.
"Oh! where are my little ducks?" she called
out to her mother, who was kneading dough.
"They are in the old coop, dear, ana you
may go and feed them."
So Patty hurried to the pantry and mixed
some cornmeal with water to feed the little
ducks. She ran out to the coop and saw some
of "the sweetest little duckies in the world."
She threw some dabs of cornmeal to them and
laughed to see them scramble for it.
Patty fed her ducks right along for a few
days, but one corning when her mother called
her, lnstead of getting up cheerfully as she
usually did, she got up slowly, grumbling
"Oh! dear, dear, every morning I have to get
up before I'm half awake. Oh 1 dear, dear."
Instead of feeding her ducks, she lay on the
sofa and read a story book.
She soon forgot all about her ducks until
after dinner, when her mother said, "Have
you fed your ducks, Patty? 1 '
"No, mamtne," said Patty. "I'm tired of
those bothersome ducks, but I suppose I'll
have to," she grumbled as she walked off.
She took out a pan of corn and went out on
the porch. Bittingdown on an old bushel basket
she began to shell the corn with a very cross
expression on her usually smiling face.

LETA'S DUCKLINGS.
Leta's papa is very poor and has to work very
hard to make a living for himself and little
daughter.
Their home is a pretty place near the river,
In which Leta's ducks often swim.
On the eventful morn ab ut which I am
writing Leta's papa told her that he must
raise some money by the morrow and she
would have to sell some of her little ducks.
Leta tried to look brave and answer her
father, but the tears would come at the thought
of selling her only pets.
"I must pick some berries ard peas first,"
she said to herself as she went to the house.
That done she took them and went to see her
little ducklings. They ran to her immediately.
She picked the berries over, and the ducks got
all that she dropped before she had a chance
to pick them up. Leta tried to scold, but that
was impossible now.
She thought, "Can't I make some money
without selling these little ducklings? We
won't need these berries or pears, and chere
are some more that I can get." 80 accordingly
she put those in the house, and soon came
back with some more all picked over.
She put them in a basket rendy to take to
town. When her bonnet was on she took her
basket and started.
At tbe first house she came to she sold them
all and started home with Jubilant heart, for
in her hand she held three bright round
dollars.
When she got home she found her father
there and he seemed to be happy, too, but he
only said, "There seems to be as many ducks
as ever, but not so many berries."
Leta showed him the money and told what
she had done. He laughed and called her his
dear, kind daughter.
"I shall not need your money now, pet, and
by another Sunday you shall have a pretty
new dress," he said.
So Leta still has her ducklings and, besides,
a new dress.

THE END OF TOO MUCH TEASING.
"Oh, mother, please mayn't I go down to the
hot water pasture to fish ? James Jantly says
that there are fish down there that long," and
9-year-old Martin Mandle held his hands about
six Inches apart to indicate how long the
much-desired fish tvere.
"No," said his mother, "I am afraid to have
you go. You know that several boys were
hurt there about a year ago."
"But mamma," protested Martin, "I aro for
the cow every night and I haven't got hurt
yeu"
â  "I know that," his mother answered, as she
was busily peeling potatoes for breakfast.
"But I tiiink I can trust you r â¢> for the cow,
for you have promised me thav you will come
home just as soon as you can."
"Well, I could go down about half an hour
earlier and fish about a hali an hour â I can
tell about how long that is â and â "
"Oh, yes," broke in his sister Minnie, who
was doing her best at baking hot cakes over a
scorching hot fire. "You said you were only
two or three minutes talking to James Jantly
last evening when you were at least twenty
minutes; wasn't he, mamma?"
"Never mind, Minnie," was her mother's an
swer, "and just see how you are burning those
cakes. What a fool you are. Take 'em off,
quick!"
The hot cakes being now out of danger for
the present she said to Martin: "It's no use
for you to tease, for I'm airaid to have you go.
When you get with the other boys no one
knows what will happen."
But Martin did tease, and kept teasing until
his father got out of patience and told him "to
go, and if he got killed not to blame him"
(as though if his son got killed he could blame
him after be was dead), and poor Mrs. Man
die was told to say yes until she finally gave
her consent, although with reluctance.
Martin was on his way to the "fishing hole,"
as tbe boys called it, on the fourth night after
the above conversation. James Jantly had
been with him but once, but he found other
boys for company. In four nights he had only
caught one fish, about three inches long.
To-night he had not caught anything, al
though he stayed quite a while longer than
usual, and he was out of humor.
He had promised his mother that he would
go around a hot-water stream that flowed past
the cold water and joined it, by a long path
liut to-night, when he got to the path, he said
to himself: "Now, what is the use of going
clear down to that little board over this
stream ? having to walk about a mile further
than necessary. I'll just jump right across
this water, as mamma should have let me in
the first piace. What a fool the old woman is,
anyhow."
So he took a good run and j umped â but
where? Right in tne middle of the stream, as
the girls â¢would guess, but the boysâ they
would say six feet the other side. But they
would be mistaken.
Down, down, poor Martin sank into tbe hot
mud and water, and there was a frantic flour
ishing of hands and cow rope (which he
dropped into the water in his struggles), after
the first fright of falling into the water had
partly passed away.
Butitwasof no use, the poor boy was too
frightened ana the mud too sticky to let him
out, and so he kept sinking. And it wasn't
like falling into cold water, as of course you
know, for cold water doesn't burn like hot
water, and James was too frightened now to
I hand in his mouth. I hope this letter will not
find the wastebasket. lam your little reaaer,

BUTE Canyon, Cal.. July 23, 1896.
Mist Richardsâ Dear Editress: I see in last
Sunday's Call a letter from a little f rbend of
mine in our town, and it gave me courape to
write a letter to you, too. I am 10 years old
and go to school. I have two sisters younger
than I. Our baby i% five years old. In place
of a very little baby we have a white cat with
a black tail, a big black dog and ever so many
little chickens that are very tame, and we
dress all our pets up like dolls and think it
quite as nice as a real baby.
We will not have any vacation this summer,
buÂ» there are several months during the win
ter in which there is no school, and we pass
our vacation Hiding down hill and getting wet
and cola, as the snow gets very deep here.
I have never written to The Call before, but
I have solved some of the puzzles and will send
help himself, so he mustered up enough vole-. ,
to shout, "Help! help! I'm drown in." But
no one seemed to hear him, so he said in a
tone of anguish: "I s'pose I'll have to codk
here now. Wish I'd minded mother, or better
that I'd never heard of this miserable hole."
And he began to cry, as I guess anybody,
wonld. 1 know I would have "cried any eye 3
out" long before he even commenced' to
whimper.
But somebody did hear his cries, and that
was Minnie, who came rurning up just in
time. Her mother had become nervous about #
Martin and had sent Minnie so see what the
matter was. At first Minnie was all excite
ment, but she became calmer 'as she realized
that she could not help her brother in that
state.
She snatched the cow rope from the water â¢
and quickly tied Herself to a .small tree and
then reached out her hand for Martin : "Here;
catch hold," she said, "quick, andâ oh, Martini
don't look like that 1"
Her brother caught her hand and was pulled
out, but not very easily. If Minnie had not "
been six years older tnan Martin, and' conse
quently heavier and stronger, he must have .
stayed where he was. But Minnie got him out,
then sank half exhausted by his side and be
gan to unfasten his clothes. She saw that,
Martin was too badly burned to walk home;
fortunately two men were coming toward. '
them, driving home their cows. They came to
the children right away, and, instead 6t arrv>
ing cows home, they carried poor little Martin
home. . # . .
The little boy had to stay in the house about'
a week was truly repentant and determined
that when his mother said "no" it was the
wisest thing for him to obey and â¢ not tease
at all. ' . â¢ '
THE DUCK'S NEST. .
Hurrah for the fun! School is done! .
Vacation we get to-day.
School is over, school is over! ' No more lea
sons for, oh, too many days to count and be
sides I am tired of counting already. Let u.s.go.
and see if aear old aunt Katie is coming. We ail
loved this auntie so well we called her Datte.
Now you must not think because I say dear
old Aunt Datie, that she is gray and wrinkled;
instead she is just like my big sister would be'
if she had lived. So out we all ran to the gate
to see if she is within sight; and, yes, there
she comes.
Of course, being well-behaved little children,
we dare uot run to meet her, bat wait patiently
until she arrives. Then she greets us with a â 
cheery "Good-morning, children," and- we all
answer, "We have vacation; do take us- some
where and let us have some fun." "W T ell, you
must first have mamma's permission.". They
very soon obtain that, and then Aunt Datie
asks where would they like to goâ to the'duck
farm or to the piggery. "To the duck farm, of _
course." Sly ones, they think they can go to"
the piggery on the way home.
Soon ready, off they start, and as it was not
very far they reach their destination in a
snort time. The first thing they see on enter
ing the yard is a little girl, like the one in Vhe
picture, sitting with a pan of peas feeding the
little tiny ducks. Oh, how sweet they were!
Just like balls df down. Aunt Datle showed
them some large, white duck eggs, and told.
them how the tiny ducklings came out of eggs
like them.
She then took the children to the pond where
the ducks drank and bathed ; also to a mother
duck on a nest. After having a lovely time,
they returned home well pleased and very
hungry. The next day their mother aud aunt â¢ â 
went out and the children got ."hungry and
concluded to have something to* eat..
They thought what fun it would, be to
cook for themselves! Fred said,: "Oh,.
Will, I can get some eggs. Yesterda?
when we were down at the duck farm. I saw
some eggs lying outside the fence, and*- so I",
will just run over aud get them. The duck
must have iost them there." So off he wÂ«i*
and soon came back with seven btg eggs.
Nellie smarted a fire and Wilt brought out- .
some biscuits, ham and tarts ahd then made
tea; then May cooked the eggs and they sat â¢
down to eat. the biscuits and eggs would be
splendid,. they said, and such fine large eggs
they were, too, only not so nice and clean as
those mamma always bad.
Jffhen they cracked the shellsâ ready to eat
themâ well, they did not smell like eggs
mamma cooked, either! However, they sea;
soned them well with salt and pepper, and all
ate them but Fred. Alas! Roor, poor fellow,
he could not eat his at all I Why? Because
there was no egg there to eat. It was:
Head, tail, feathers, feet,
Just a little duck complete. * â¢
As salt and pepper would do that no good he
had to be content with biscuits, ham and tarts,
"quite a good luncheon," mamma said, "for a
little boy who had stolen, eggs and robbed a
nest." She also said the mother duck hail la-id
her eggs outside the fence because it was quiet '
and sheltered, and that it would have be,en
much better to have left them in the rtest
until they were hatched, and how â¢
badly the mother would feel
when she returned and found them gone. She .
also told Fred how the little duckling in his
egg might have 'been alive when he took it.
He felt very sorry for cooking it and said, "I
prefer my ducks minus shell and eggs minus
duck." When Aunt Datie heard what Fred '.
bad done she said she would not take him to
the piggery, as he might rob their neststbo, .
and then we would have neither ham'nor
eggs for break/ast. Marie Chesworth. â¢
THE GIRL AND HER DUCKS.
"Come, Maggie," called Mrs. Mansfield, "ana
get me some pens for dinner."
"Yes, mamma," repikd Maggie, putting her
dollie in its carriage, for Maggie was an obeai
ent little girl.
The peas were soon picted and seating her
self on an ola basket in the corner of the porch
she began to shell them, but before she had
quite finished a band of little ducks which she
had raised herself came trooping up. beside .
her. She bad dropped quite a number of peas
and now the ducks begun to eat them.
Before they had eaten them all up one little
duck curled up ana went to sleep, while three
others walked away quite satisfied, but the
fifth one. whom Maggie had been in the habit
of petting, stood quite still, waiting for her to
take it up. But she raised her hand and shook
her head and said no, that she aid nat have
time to pet her now, but ducky would not go
away until Maggie took her mother tne peas
and came out to pet it. R. Maud Mallory.

J\ Very Ppetty Tpouville Bodice
â  This delightful model is, as its name indicates, of Parisian origin, and adds to
the charms of a fair New Yorker now at Newport. In the first place It has a lining
of white taffeta glace, and over that the poil de chevre is drawn without a seam in
"' the back. It is a semi-low bodice cut square in the back, graduated front pieces
forming the front. These are all bound with lime-green velvet exactly matching the
stripes, which are on a white ground. There is an oval buckle of burnished gold in
the center of the belt-bow, which starts from either side from the under-arm seam,
â¢ and is, as you observe, carried over the short square basque. The sleeves are very
moderate in size and are bound with velvet around the point, which extends about
half an inch over the band. Under the soft lace and mousseline de soie, forming the
vest, is seen the white silk. The soft crush collar is of the velvet and has a soft
' . edging next the throat of the mousseline de soie, and it terminates in pretty outstand
ing ends in the back. The artistic hat of white straw has an edging of mousseline de
soie that exactly matches the shade of the velvet. From two bunches of green
' primroses arise a cluster of white sweet peas with their leaves. The white gloves
worn have very narrow lines of lime-green silk stitching. How good a thing it is to
be young and most divinely fair and wear such a delightful garment.
Silk, Petticoats Jlpe Fashionable
Months ago I announced that horsehair
was going out of fashion. Still some who
should know better are now even having
their skirts lined with it. As a result it
will cut through the fabrics probably, and
at all events make the skirts unnecessarily
heavy. lam assured that in three months
large sleeves will be a thing of the past;
* " our skirts will not measure, at the most,
over four yards and a half around, and
interlinings will be regarded with marked
disapprobation. Well, we have been carry
ing around about three extra and unneces
sary pounds for quite long enoueh and
should hail with delight the advent of a
new skirt, even if some are found to sigh
over the departed glories of their dearly
beloved balloon sleeves, although most
of us are glad enough to bid them adieu.
Our silk petticoats are (so says one noted
Parisian authority) to measure three and a
bait yards around the bottom and are to
have two or three medium ruffles, in the
hems of which must be run a very nar
row, flexible steel tape. This will do away
with horsehair, grass cloth, canvas and
fiber chamois interlinings in our skirts,
but only tne very best site can be utilized,
otherwise the steel will quickly cut out the
ruffles. Worth is having, in both taffeta
and surah, a specially heavy silk manu
factured for this express purpose. Such
petticoats will be very reasonable at $10.
One of our best dressmakers here tells me
that she could make them to sell at that
figure and would carry out the same idea
in alpaca for less, bui if you are going to
indulge in only one such model be ad
vised and have the silk.
Make a mental note of these facts:
Floi ally patterned cameleon faille is much
liked; shot surah 40 inches wide is being
used; many of the wash goods, especially
those in plain colors, now being sold so
reasonably, will pay to purchase and lay
aside for next summer; organdies are also
desirable at their present figure. Silk
skirts will be worn next winter, but, as
they are not to be over four yards in
widtli, many remnants of silk now marked
below cost may be profitably secured.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 2, 1896.
J\ Canvas and a Flannel Sown
The figure to the left wears a very fetching sailor gown of heavy linen canvas.
Very beautifully does the young matron dress who ordered from her tailor this cre
ation, in which she has been greatly admired at one of our most fashionable seaside
resorts. She has never informed even her most intimate friends where that heavy
linen canvas, which is so extremely swell, came from. The skirt measures less than
five yards, the seams are strapped, and throughout this delicious dress is lined with
white taffeta. The stylish collar and revers are of the same and the mousseline vest
has a foundation of this silk. The soft waistband is of black satin. White silk
encircles the throat and little lace ends hang over the sides. This lace is an ex
tremely welcome addition to the vest. The coat is well cut and jaunty. The sleeves
have two rows of silk stitching around the wrist and two exceptionally good mother
of-pearl buttons. Note how the linen is stitched over the silk collar and revers. The
hat was made to order out of horsehair, white and cream being combined most hap
pily. The black quills are dotted with white. The parasol is of white silk, through
which run creamy white lines. No fair Parisian could have conceived, even with
Worth's assistance, a more satisfactory costume for the seashore. White kids,
stitched with narrow lines of black silk, are worn by this dainty American, who
could make a fortune designing frocks.
The figure to the right is draped in a dress of pale blue flannel, striped with a
darker shade of the same material. How simple this sounds, and naturally the
effect depends on the perfection of each and every detail. As you see,'the skirt is
beyond criticism. The fair wearer dislikes as much as many Parisian grand dames
to have her frocks rustle, so this toilette is lined throughout with a light-colored,
heavy rich tan-colored surah, which exactly matches the large collar, shirt and cuffs
of tan drill. The belt is of a fine soft leather one shade darker than the drill. The
small buttons are of pearl a shade lighter than the drill and are ornamental, such a
relief from the overcrowded way some women employ them. The studs exactly
match them. The cravat matches the dark stripe, and the hat of Panama straw is
bound with a ribbon matching the stripe and two quills of the same shade having
tan-colored dots. The striking belle who wears this costume is so critical on the sub
ject of wearing apparel that it is sufficient guarantee of its excellence to say it is liked
by her. __^
Ppineess Gowns J\?e Worn in Paris
In a few weeks autumn hats, gowns and
fabrics only will be under discussion, for
fickle Dame Fashion has done with em
broidered lawns, muslin*, organdies,
piques and all such materials and is now
giving her undivided attention to chev
iots and woolens of all descriptions, and in
Paris it is known that the favorite shape
for indoor wear will be the princess and
the bolero or Figaro for the street.
Felix, Doucet and Laferriere are fash
ioning princess frocks out of eoliennes
and bengaliaes, soft shades of gray being
in great vogue, although slate color is also
popular.
For early autumn have been designed
some tailor costumes in a shot mo
hair serge in two shades â of dead-leaf
green and also in a warm brown. They
have been cut with the narrow-gored
skirt, and have either the short bolero or
the jaunty little jacket.
The pockets are square, and I can tell
you now that the swellest traveling taiicr
suits will be made of plaid, not the small
check, remember, but a beautifully
blended large blue and green plaid, with
here and there a yellow, a white or a
red line, wfcu which can still
be worn the silk bodice or silk shirtwaist
which wiil supplant the cotton and linen
ones we have all become so fond of. For
tnte street the bolero will be very short,
however, I must now chronicle what is
being worn by the smart set at the present
moment
The short white pique jacket, cat at the
seam and falling a trifle below the waist,
may be worn with a stray, blue or ecru
skirt, opening over a white chemisette at
tached with a band of white leather.
For a long voyage always select a com
fortable hat, and there Is no reason why
it should not be pretty and becoming as
well. Tne tarn o' shanter and the English
walking hat, made of dark cloth, are the
most styiish shapes. Women with round
or broad faces look the best in tarn o'
shanters, and they may select one having
a crown composed of a series of gores,
which are apparently held in place in the
center by means of a button. The brim
is short and rolls back. The only orna
mentation is a ribbon bow at the left side,
through which a quill is stuck, or they
may prefer one having the crown all in
one piece. The English walking hat has a
narrow, stiff brim. Round the crown is a
loosely twisted band of net, through
which a quill feather is passed.
The Queen of tha Belgians plays the
harp exquisitely.
Sold, Silver and Peari Brocade
The Duchess of York wore this exquisite gown at a great state concert lately.
It is said to have suited the Duchess wonderfully well and was made for her by a
Dublin dressmaker. I canrfot do this creation full justice, I fear, but imagine, if you
can, the heaviest of white satin covered with an artistic design of roses and true
lovers' knots carried out in gold, silver and pearls. It was cut en princesse, the front
having the effect of a separate skirt. The train is well worthy of our attention, as it
is of exactly the right length and hangs admirably. The low-cut bodice was finished
round the neck with some exquisite chiffon, embroidered in silver and pearls. Of
this the sleeves, of most moderate size, were made. A beautiful and costly pearl
ornament adorned the front of the corsage and at the waist line, in front, was a softly
wrinkled piece of plain white satin introduced, while costly jeweled buttons finished
it at either end. Such a dress should be treasured as a work of art, however, but
only a faint idea of its magnificence can be conveyed by this description.
For a long voyage always select a comfortable hat, and there is no reason why
it sho'-.ld not be pretty and becoming as well. The Tarn o' Shanter and the English
walking-hat, made of dark cloth, are the most stylish shapes. Women with round

J\ Central Park, Cycling Costume.
The cuffs of the shirt waist of the up-to
date New York girl are fastened witn
links, buttons having been banished com
pletely. She is now wearing "long side
combs of shell and shell studded with
brilliants and pearls for full-dress occa
sions. They are worn on each side of the
back hair, facing the ears, in order that
the front hair may be pushed forward to
give the loose although tidy effect so
necessary to-day for one who is bien mis 6.
When an additional high-standing comb
is added it is larger than were the fancy
hairpins which have disappeared. Ribbon
bows are not now used in the hair, unless
it be a very small one used to support an
aigrette or some ornament when in full
dres?."
I presume that most of us are quite wili
ng to abiae by the New York criticism.
Of late I have spoken but seldom concern
ing bicycle costumes and at the present
moment I myself have no strikingly orig
inal ideas to offer, so instead give you the
description of a costume written by a
bright correspondent of Vogue: "In the
park tne other morning, when it was cool
and delightful, I saw a becoming cycling
habit worn by a very pretty woman, ac
companied by her two young sons. It was
built of navy-blue corduroy cloth. In
point of color and texture it was perfect.
A tight-fitting coat bodice belted with
black satin, with narrow basque lying flat
to the figure, which was slight and grace
ful. The bodice was worn with a divided
skirt, than which no other hangs half so
well. A dark blue straw English turban,
with full niching of pinked-out blue taffetas
a bunch of blue quills at the side, empha
sized the note of neatness and trimness so
desirable. Then came the well put-on
veil, the delicate bands of throat and cuff
linen, the immaculate cravat with lace in
crusted on the mull, a pleasing feminine
touch to soften the severe cloth outlines.
Black silk-ribbed hose above the neatest
of black ties buttoned at the sides. The
freshest of white chamois gloves. Park
rides and country rides, each have a fit
style, and what will answer for one will
not for the other."
Much interest is .always manifested by
women concernine their stockings, so it
will not be amiss to quote an extract from
an English correspondent appertaining to
the hand-loom weaving of stockings in
Edinburgh. Among other things she re
marks: "It takes several years to become
a proficient workman, but the pay to these
is high, and some of the finest tartan-silk
stockings are paid tor at the rate of two
guineas a pair, or even a little more. Or.
ders come from all over the civilized world
for hose, large and small, and a pair of ,
heather mixture or tartan-wool stockings
to match a costume can be supplied in a
few hours. The best work is done by
men, but about half a hundred women are
employed in the modern knitting-machine
department, where all the cheap hose is
done. This is beginning to supersede the
good old work, and it is feared that in time
the beautiful art (which probably came
over with the French artisans in Queen j
Mary Stuart's time and has thriven ever j
since) will die out. At the present time
there are, however, a good many custom, j
ers who will only have the real thing at !
the recognized old price. The knitted \
fancy squares for shooting waistcoats is I
another branch of industry which employs !
a great many women and has a good sale.
The women sit knitting, or 'weavine,' as
they still call it, with the different bails of
wool in a basin beside them."
The leading jewelers are busily exercis
ing their ingenuity in devising new silver
toys as the fad for collecting them con- I
tinues. One of the latest designs is a mi
nute and perfect reproduction of a colonial
chair, which will be duly appreciated, I
doubt not, by "ye high colonial dames."
Lovers of beautiful china will enjoy a
visit to one of our leading stores, for some
really lovely Austrian (or Carlsbad) china
has just arrived. You can purchase plates
of all sizes, cups for coffee, chocolate, tea
or cafe noir, coffee-pots, cream pitchers,
chocolate jugs, plaques, bonbon
nieres and pintrays at most reason
able figures. We have all seen and
admired Carlsbad china, but never before
have we seen any so exquisite. The
borders of the plates are all oi a rare shade
of blue with touches of cold. In the
center of each is a wonderfully executed
miniature head of either Napoleon,
Josephine, the little king of Rome, . or of
distinguished men or women of that era,
excellent reproductions of well-known por- â 
traits and miniatures. Such china is quite |
sufficient to revive an interest in those
days. On every piece may also be seen
the imperial monogram. For a wedding j
present what could be more welcome than
a dozen of such plates or what prettier for
a little birthday remembrance than a
bonbonniere? Marcblla.

â¢ . It is less than twenty years ago since the ;
â¢ introduction of tbe electric lieht, and I
while inventive genius has been busy de- :
vising' many improvements in the neces- 1
sa'ry mechanism of electric production and
application yet such improvements have
not given to the public cheap light.
v>'iien,in 1877, the newspapers published
â¢ tbe statement of Mr. Edison, that "he
â would be able to produce within a year J

â¢ holdings* at a very low price, because they
tliought that eas was to be supplanted by
the new light. AlaÃ for our hopes! The j
beautiful and brilliant electric light is not !
a 'cheap illuminant.
There has now been discovered a princi
ple in magneto-electrics that upsets all
â previous theories and bids fair to solve
the problem of cheap lighting by render
ing it possible to produce the electric light
(as well as electric power) at a ridiculously
â¢ low cost.
. Recent investigations and experiments '
show it to be practical to apply the newly
discovered principle to present systems
and reduce the cost of the light to less
than 1 per cent of what it now costs.
If we wrap some insulated wire around
fhe ends or poles of a magnet, then any
change which may take place in the j
Strength or intensity of the magnet will I
produce a current of electricity on the in
.sulated wire, and this current may be con
veyed to a distance by the use of conduct
ing wires.
If at any place or places in the conduct
ing wire we insert a substance which offers
a greater resistance to the flow of the cur
rent than does the wire, the substance will
. get hot, owing to tne energy of the current
being expended at that place in overcom
ing the resistance, and so producing heat. |
Kow, the electric lamps which we use at
the present time consist of resistances,
â which are extremely great as compared
â with the resistance of the conducting wire.
In"the incandescent lamp a filament of
carbon is used, while in the arc lamp the
carbon pencils are kept separated, and the
sir between the points of the carbons is
employed as the resistance. The current
. . of electricity when it arrives at one of these
points of resistance converts its energy
into heat of sufficient intensity to render
the resisting substance luminous.
The electric current is produced by rap
idly revolving the armature of the dynamo
jn close contact with the poles of the dy
namo magnet, which are wrapped with in
sulated wire. Each revolution ot the ar
- mature weakens and strengthens alter
nately the intensity of the magnet, and so
produces a current of electricity on the in
sulated wire.
. Now the work of rotating the armature
.calls for the expenditure of power, and
here is where the cost comes in. The cost
of the'electric light must always depend
â¢upon the cost of the power employed.
Where coal is used as a power producer,
the.cost must necessarily be high. Again,
â¢ the present crude and faulty construction
6f the resistance points, i.e., the lamps,
renders it impossible to convert into light
all the electrical energy developed ; by far I
: the larger portion is always non-luminous
heat. "With an ideal lamp, ten times the
number of Jighta could be lit by the same
amount of electrical energy that is now re
quired to maintain one lamp.
â  The law of magnetic attraction, as laid
down in the textbooks, is that "Like
Doles repel; unlike poles attract." That
is, the north pole of one magnet will at
tract tha south polÂ« and repel the north
'pole of another magnet.
Tho discoverer of the carious phenom
enon I am about to describe was experi
menting with a couple of ordinary steel
magnets placed with opposite poles in po
â¢ tition, and consequently exercising an at
traction for each other, when it was found
that the introduction of a thin aliver of
soft iron between the poles of the two
magnets completely changed the nature
of their power ; the like poles attracted and
the unlike ones repelled.
Diagram A will help to exphvin the phe
nomenon. The magnet "A" is rigidly axed (
and magnet "B" ib pivoted upon a horizon
tal axis, so that if may oscillate. A piece of i
thin, soft iron is suspended so as to pass I
freely between the ends of the two mag- i
nets. The cord supporring the soft Iron
passes over a pulley and is attached to the !
end of magnet "B.:
Without the presence of the soft iron
the poles of the two magnets exercise at
traction, and the magnet '"U" is held in a
horizontal position. When, however, the
piece of soft iron drops in between the
magnets the attraction is immediately
changed to repulsion, and the end of mag
net "B." which is free to move, is forced
downward. The piece of sofi iron is con
nected by the supporting cord in such
manner that, when the end of magnet
"B" drops, it raises t c soft iron and
thereby permits attraction, causing the
end of "B" to then rise: but, in so doing,
it drops the soft iron, the presence of
which causes repulsion. A series of alter
nate attractions and repulsions is thus
produced, communicating to magnet "B"
a motion of rapid oscillation.
To make practical application of this
phenomenon to the production of light a
machine is constructed, as shown in dia
gram B.
The magnet "A" is rigidly attached to a
support, and magnet "B" pivoted on a
horizontal axis, so that its poles are free
to revolve in a vertical circle in front of
the poles of magnet -'A." The strip of
soft iron is suspended from an eccentric
that is driven by means of a cord which
passes around a pulley fixed to the spindle
of magnet "B."
Once started magnet "B" must revolve,
and at each revolution it changes the mag
netic intensity of magnet "A." A spool
or helix of insulated wire surrounds each
pole of magnet "A," and this wire is
charged by a current of electricity gener
ated in ptecisely the same manner as is
the current created by our present form of
dynamo. It is, in fact, the same kind of
current, and it may be taken from the
spools and conveyed away and used, as is

THE MOM WILL '
CAST HER SHADOW ON THE
EARTH'S LUMINARY
JOTAL EGLIPSE OF JHE SUN ON JHE 9TH OF
/UJQUST JO BE OBSERVED AT YEZO
BY LICK ASTRONOMERS
Before the present week has passed as
tronomers will have gleaned some further
knowledge about the mysterious surround
ings of the sun, which for centuries have
been a cause of wonder and investigation
when revealed to view for a few minutes
by a total solar eclipse.
The intensity of sunlight is such that it
is only on the rare occasions when the
moon acts as a screen, by passing between
the earth and sun, that the solar append
ages, the chromosphere, the prominences
and the corona can be most advantage
ously studied. The latter, indeed, has
rarely if ever been discerned at other
times. This is tbe incentive that has led
astronomers from all parts of tbe globe to
travel to those favoied spots that lie in
the track of the moon's shadow, with in
struments devised years in advance and
plans prearranged so as to forestall any
obstacles that might interfere with their
aims.
California ha 3 not forgotten the view of
the sun's corona obtained January 1, 1889,
and her astronomers are foremost in the
expeditions that have been prepared to
observe th^ eclipse occurring on the Bth
of this month in far distant lands, for the
sun has set on the Pacific Coast before it
commences.
They are fully equipped with the best
portable instruments, and all expenses
including that of a journey to Japan, have
been defrayed by the generosity of Colonel
C. F. Crocker, Mrs. Phoebe Hearst and the
Hon. William M. Pierson.
As may be seen from the diagram rep
resenting the theory of total solar eclipses,
a tapering shadow projects from tbe moon
to the earth, and though correct relative
sizes and distances are necessarily ignored
it may be seen that the dark shadow
meets the surface before the cone is ter
minated, which occurs when the earth's
satellite is at or near perigee and also at
or very near its node. It will then be j
some thousands ot miles less than its
mean distance of 238,800 miles from the
j earth, and its disk, being nearer than j
usual, will seem slightly larger than that
of the sun, and will cover that luminary
completely for a few minutes.
The lighter shading in the diagram is
the penumbra, which extends around the
darker shadows or umbra, and falls on aj
much larger area, in which tbe sun is seen |
j more or less partially eclipsed; but these ;
views nave not thescientific importance of |
the few minutes of total eclipse with
which a limited area is favored.
These valuable minutes will be well
utilized by the dozen or more parties who
have traveled afar to waylay the small ;
shadow as it flits over the path marked on
tha accompanying map, commencing in the
Arctic seas near Norway and terminating â 
in the North Pacific Ocean. This path of
totality on the present occasion, as may be
seen, lies far from the centers of civiliza
tion and the radiance of the corona will
glimmer unseen over the wilds of Siberia i
and ba mirrored only in the heedless waves
for many thousands of miles.
It is to be hoped, however, that many of
its choicest rays may fall on the object
glasses that have been sent ao far to re
flect its marvelons structure. While the
features of the solar disk may be observed
at all times with magnifying power, all
the strange surroundings beyond it are
invisible to observers in general. Close to
the limb or circumference of tbe sun lies
the chromosphere "like a prairie on fire,"
though luminous heat there, even when
red and fire like, is far beyond the mere
burning stage, all parts being fused and
vaporous to an intensa degree unknown
on this earth. At intervals much higher
appendages appear of the same glowing
hue, which is due to hydrogen, the chief
constituent of these two phenomena.
These high prominences, often treelike or
cloudlike in form, varying in height from
thousands to hundreds of thousands of
miles, are probably jets of the lighter solar
substances thrown out by the violent
activity within the intensely heated sun.
The chromosphere and prominences can
be s en fairly well at almost any time by
means of a spectroscope, though the ab
sence of sunlight considerably facilitates
observation of details, but the corona
which extends far beyond them is the
main object of attention during totality.
It is then clearly visible to the naked eye
and has been observed since the earliest
ages with wonder and admiration. As the
body of the moon, in passing between the
earth and sun, first encroaches on tbe
west side, the orb of day assumes a strange
gibbous shape and gradually diminishes in I
1
tial vacuum. Crookes tubes are well
known examples of this phenomenon. In
the new lamp there is no filament of car
bon. The electrical energy is not called
upon to expand itself in the production of
heat. There is nothing to bar its prog
ress. The lamp is simply a glass tube
from which the air has been nearly all
extracted, and in the opposite ends of the
glass are blown wires which terminate
just inside the tube.
The incandescent lamp now in n?e is a
very clumsy affair. It seems to have been
based on the idea that tnere is consider
able warmth in a fight; for it offers fight
to the electrical energy that attempts to
overcome the great resistance of the car
bon filament, and compels that energy to
expend itself in the battle, mainly in the
exhibition of useless heat.
The vacuum lamp affords the elecrtica!
energy an opportunity whereby it may,
for the time being, change its dress, so to
speak, without loss of itÂ« vitality, and
masquerade under the guise of light with
no great diminution of energy, every par
ticle of electricity manifesting itself in
luminosity and without heat.
There are no known physical or mechan
ical difficulties in the way of producing
illumination on precisely the lines here
laid down. That such a mode of lighting
has not yet been made public does not
preclude ite availability, it has passed
out from the realm of possibility, for it is
now within the domain of probability. It
is both feasible and practical. The cost of
light produced by such a syÃtein as herein
described would be a mere bagatelle as
compared with what the present expense
is under existing systems. The entire ex
penditure would be in the first cost of
plant and installation. Maintenance
would be extremely little. A 16-candle
power, lamp would not cost 1 cent per
year. Frank M. Close, D. Sc.
area until reduced to a slender crencent
white and brilliant, but yielding a light
that is neither that of noon nor sunset.
Then a luminous halo seems to glimmer
into existence around the dark moon,
and radiates into wonderful beauty when
the sun is entirely obscured. This coronal
phenomenon has been variously depicted
and described, but the following descrip
tion by Professor C. A. Young accords
with general impressions:
The portion of the corona nearest the
sun is almost dazzlingly bright, with a
greenish pearly tinge which /contrasts
finely with the Ecarlet blaze of the promi
nences. It is made up of streaks and
filaments which on the whole radiate out
ward from the sun's disk, though they are
in many places strangely curved and inter
twined. Usually these filaments are
longest in tbe sunspot zones, thus giving
the corona a more or less quadrangular
figure. At the very poles of the sun, how
ever, there are often tufts of sharply de
fined threads. For the most part the
streamers have a length not much exceed
ing the sun's radius, but some of them at
almost every eclipse go far beyond this
limit. In the clear air of Colorado, during
the eclipse of 1878, two of them could be
traced for five or six degrees â a distance of
at least 9,000,000 miles from the sun.
A most striking feature of the corona
usually consists of certain dark rifts,
which reach straight out from the moon's
limb to the extremest limit of the corona.
The corona varies much in brightness at
different eclipses, and, of course, the de
tails are never twice the same. Its total
light under ordinary circumstances is at
least two or three times as great as that of
the full moon. The eclipse of this week
would in the classification of ancient as
tronomers be colled a repetition (saros) of
the eclipse of 1878, because it occurs under
the same general conditions and in nearly
the same part of the heavens after an ip
terval of eighteen years ten and a third
days. The fraction of a day causes it to
be visible in a more westerly region.
Though not a repetition, the two are con
secutive eclipses of the same series, which
extend over many centuries.
This relationship, however, affects
chiefly the duration of the eclipse, and,
beyond the visibility of the coronal rays,
will not influence their general contour.
Some of the same fixed stars will come
forth to bear witness to the absence of sun
light, and as tbe sun is in the constella
tion of Leo at present, Regulus will min
gle its white light with that of the corona.
An interesting feature of the coming scene
will be the brilliant light of the three
planets, Jupitfer, Venus and Mercury, on
the east side, within a few degrees of the
sun. Tbe results on tba\"paft of the earth !
within the shadow will he scarcely less
impressive. First comes the strange dark
ness, that unearthly shadow that may
never revisit the same landscape, speeding
with such velocity from the west; the sud
den twilight that is neither dawn nor
dusk; the unwonted violet tints in the
upper atmosphere; the yellow gleams
from the distant illuminated stratum near
the horizon, and then the weird vanishing
of all the marvels just as we commence to
realize them.
What is the corona? is a question that
has been asked for centuries.
It is one of the unsettled problems of
solar physics, and for that reason the as
tronomers have gone forth to try and
bring back a satisfactory answer.
The neighborhood of Varanger Fjord,
to which a well-equipped expedition has
been sent by the Royal Astronomical So
ciety of London, is a wild, mountainous
land, an Arctic wilderness, where reindeer
moss is the only vegetation excepting a
scant herbage in the valleys cccupied by
the Norwegian fishermen. This has been
selected as a desirable station by many
European parties, though the eclipsÃ
takes place in the early morning hours
before the sun is far above the horizon
and the duration is less than two minutes.
Among the icebergs on the bleak coast
of Nova Zernbla a party of Russian scien
tists have sought a footing; but the rug
ged Northmen will cheerfully withstand
the chill of any surroundings except an
enveloping fog, which is too likely to be
their only sky view. Another important
Russian station is near the river Amur in
Siberia.
The shadow, passing in a southwest di
rection, lingers here nearly two and a half

time it envelops the main portion of

sponds with 9:40 p. m., August 8, here, a3
Japan leads in date, being near the inter
national date line on the west side. Sev
eral English and American expeditions
have selected Yezo as an observing sta
tion. Near the east coast Professor
Schaeberle of the Lick Observatory will
again use the telescope forty feet in focal
length with which he obtained the beauti
ful photograph represented in the illustra
tion. From this and previous ones taken
in Cayenne December, 1889, he discovered 1
features in the corona not clearly dis
cerned before and was led to form his
famous theory of its probable cause.
At the same station Mr. Burckhalter of
the Chabot observatory will for the first
time practically test the ingenious ap
paratus that he invented for photograph
ing the fainter outer coronal rays with the
fullest exposure, while the brighter inner
parts are protected from over exposure by
a rapidly revolving screen composed of
tapering extensions united near the base
of tbe inner corona. If this excellent
design is successful it will save future
astronomers from studying the entire
appendage from fragmentary pictures sup
plied by instruments of different powers.
Observations and photographs will also
be taken in Yezo by other local and East
ern parties, among which are to be found
Dr. G. E. Shuey, Louis C. Masten and
Professor Todd, who has observed many
eclipses on other occasions.
Two English expeditions have been
equipped with recently revised coelastats
adapted to eclipse observations by the ex
perience and skill of Dr. Comman, presi
dent of the Royal Astronomical Society.
As shown by the Illustration it con

heavens toward the tube of the telescope
in the adjacent shed. Excellent results
are expected from this instrument, which
has been on trial for some time at Oxford
University. As nearly all the accessible
positions where favorable weather could
be expected are occupied by one or more
parties, it is highly probable that satis
factory results will be obtained by some,
and that these scientific expenditures will
have brought new light and knowledge
before many days have passed.

jKe Astronomical Expeditions.
The expedition to Japan for the purpose
of observing the total eclipse of the sun,
which occurs on the 9th inst., is the third
which baa been sent out under the
auspices of the Lick Observatory for this
identical object. The first expedition was
organized in 1839, and consisted of S. W.
Burnham, who is now with the Chicago
University as manager of the great 40
--mch Yerkes equatorial, and J. M.
Schaeberle, who is chief of the Japan ex
pedition of 1896. The total, eclipse of
December, 1889, was observed by the Lick
expedition at Cayenne, French Guiana,
and its expenses were defrayed, as in the
case of that of this year, by Colonel
Charles F. Crocker, whose liberality en
abled the Lick Observatory to organize its
expedition under the most complete
auspices, re-enforced by instruments of
the highest power and effectiveness. The
scientific results of the Cayenne expedi
tion fully justified the anticipations of as
tronomers.
Photography enabled the observers to
secure for all time visible reproductions of
solar phenomena of the eclipse, and the
astronomers from the great California
observatory achieved results which greatly
added to the reputation of the Lick among
the scientists of the world. It was dur
ing the observations at Cayenne that
Schaeberle advanced the proposition of
"A Mechanical Theory of the Solar
Corona," a theory which greatly startled
astronomers at the time, but which Pro
fessor Schaeberle demonstrated almost be
yound a doubt in his subsequent publica
tions.
The second expedition undertaken by the
Lick Observatory was one to observe the
total eclipse of the sun of April 16, 1893,
which was visible over the greater portion
of the inhabited sections in the southern
hemisphere. Chile was selected as the
most favorable location for observation,
and a little mining station of Minas
Bronces was chosen on account of its
favorable atmospheric conditions. The
expenses of the expedition were defrayed
by Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, which was equipped
with the best instruments that were avail
able.

IMPOJ*T/\NJ DEVIGE INVENTED BY J\
CjiICAQO JMN.
Had the invention of Charles Cura
mingg of Chicago, 111., been available a
few months ago it would not have been
such a prodigious task to raise the sunken
Blairmore. That is, of course, provided
the idea works as well in practice as it
does on paper. But really it is so simple
there is absolutely no reason why it
sh ruld not work. It has been tested and
found to wort to perfection on a small
scale.
The Cummings apparatus is called by
the inventor an "inflatable truss bag."
The principle on which it works is easily
explained. Suppose a common tin can
was opened and relieved of all its solid
contents. If a small hole was then made
in the bottom, or it was forced beneath
the sdrface of a barrel full of water, it
would soon sink to the botfom. Now sup*
pose that a toy balloon, d fluted, and with
several feet of hose, one end of which was
made secure at the opening so that it
could be "blown up" at will, was made
fast to the tin can while it was on the bot
tom of the barrel of water. If. at this
point of the proceedings air was forced
through the hose the balloon would begin
to expand. When enough air had been
forced into it to displace an amount of
water corresponding to the weight of the
tin can the balloon would riso to the top,
of course bringing the tin c:m along with it.
The apparatus for which Mr. Cummings
has just received a patent consists of sev
eral bagÂ« made of strong material, and
with ropes and chains for securing them
to the sunken vessel. The size used de
pends altogether on the size of the vessel
to be raised.
These bags are deflated and made fast to
the vessel by divers. Air is then pumped
into them from the machinery on the
wrecking steamer until enough water is
displaced 10 cause them to rise to the sur
face and bring the vessel with them.
The position in which these bags are
placed depends altogether on how it is de
sired to raise the vessel. If the vessel is
uninjured and on an even keel they could
be fastened around the bulwarks, and
when the vensel was above water she could
be towed to a drydock.
If the vessel had a hole in her bottom
the bags could be placed on one side until
she turned over. Others could then be
placed at thi keel until she was bottom
up. By placing other bags in the proper
places the vessel could be raised to the
surface in this position and the hole
repaired. By expanding or deflating the
bags on the sides the vessel can be moved
in any position with the utmost ease.
Mr. Cummings has received patents on
all parts of his apparatus. The bags are
made out of a very strong material and
provided with strips that extend across
from side to side, to give extra strength.
The method of fastening these straps so
that they will not tear through the bag is
also patented. An ordinary airpump of
large size, driven by a ?team-en?ine, can
be used, but instead of forcing the air
directly into the truss bags it first pumps
it into a receiver, where it is under the
control of the operator, who can inflate or
deflate a bag at will.
The Bed Sea Miracle.
The Red Sea miracle receives strong cor
roboration in the report of Major-General
Tulloch, who made surveys in Egypt for
the Government Of Great Britain. On one

THE
STAGE
"Hard times" have not been denoted by
the size of the audiences at the local piay
honses during the past week, nor has
laughter hidden itself in some gloomy
cavern. At one of the houses, at least,
the line of persons seeking admission has,
night after- night, been kept up until after
the time for curtain-rise. The pleasure
seekers chattered and chaffed and
laughed good-naturedly while waiting to
enter and also between acts. The man
agers all look cheerful and anticipate
much good business to come because their
attractions have been so well vfpt. While
so many' local houses are kept open here
the Eastern managers seem to have wilted
under climatic conditions. Last week not
a solitary theater in Boston, which is ordi
narily classtd as regular, was open. New
' York audiences mostly haunted the roof
gardens. Meanwhile the happy San Fran
ciscan went forth to enjoy and to be en
joyed.
While we have suffered no interruption
in our pastimes, and while the coin we
paid at the ticket-windows has not been
in danger of melting, those Eastern peo
ple who have been driven away from
home to seek the solace of sea breezes have
tried to divert themselves with dramas
which can be played out of doors. "As
You Like It" was produced for the fash
ionables and semi-fashionables at As
bury Park, which, it may not be neces
sary to state, except to incidentally sug
gest environments, is in New Jersey.
Wh.it a welting of linen Ihere was m the
wrestling match! How the audience
/smiled while the delicate odor of frangi
. panni was wafted hither and yon by the
incessant waving of fans, plied incessantly
because of the heat, at the ditty, "Blow,
blow, tbou winter wind." Miss Marie
Wainwright was the Rosalind. How it
must have been can easily be imagined.
On her brow â was perspiration. In her
eyes â longing for icecream soda. On her
lips, what should never be on the lips of
ajiy lady â a Jsew Jersey mosquito!
What tbe public in San Francisco can
enjoy during the coming week is indicated
quite fully by the announcements which
are made below. There is variety and
merit. The public may safely be counted
upon to furnish the appreciation.
At the Baldwin.
There are two weeks left of the engage
ment of Charles Frohman's Empire Thea
ter Company .at the Baldwin Theater. As
was originally planned and announced
there will be a new play for each of these
weeks. To-morrow night Pinero's drama
illustrative of social decadence and en
titled "The Benefit of the Doubt" will be
given. 'While there is plenty of comedy
in tnis work, still it is a play of serious
import, as it derives a lesson from the
divorce court and in a merciless way deals
with the follies of modern society. Alto
getner it will be a much different medium
for the expression of the Empire Com
pany's acting abilities from what Mr.
Fitch's "Bohemia" was. In the latter
piece Mr. Frohman's players had simply
to please, to amuse, and skipped about
the stage in hvdy manner and merry
mood: in "The Benefit of the Doubt"
they have a much more serious and diffi
cult task, for the drama is full of strong
' dramatic situations and will demand a
high plane of bistrionism.
â¢Pinero's play, after making a London
success, was produced at the Lyceum
' Theater, where it also succeeded. In the ,
absence of the Western tour of the Lyceum
company Daniel Frohman has arranged
with his brother Charles for its presenta
tion by the Empire company, to whose
abilities it is perfectly suited. It will
have a splendid cast to-morrow night, ail
.of Charles Frohman's leading players be
ing concerned in the performance. This
" is the story of "The Benefit of the Doubt"
â¢ in brief: Mrs. Emptage is a careiess
mother, whose daughters, Theophila
â¢Fraser and Justina Emptage, are at least
eligible for membership in the fast set.
Theophila is married to a dull Scotchman.
During his absence she seeks intellectual
consolation in the society of John Ailing
ham. The attachment is purely platonic,
but Allingham's wife is a female Othello.
She brings a suit for ludicial separation
and Mrs. Fraser's name is mixed up un
pleasantly in the court proceedings. The
judge, however, gives her "the banefit of
the doubt," but the woman's name was
.smirched. Her husband agrees to stand
I by her, but Mrs. Fraser has by this time
become reckless. She decided to see
Allingham once more.
He has just had an interview with his
wife, who seeks a reconciliation. Mrs.
Fraser arrives. She is tired and hungry.
Food and drink are set before her and
after tossing off a tumbler of champagne
she begins to feel better, but under the
influence of the wine her old recklessness
returns and Mrs. Allingham, who is con
cealed behind the door, hears her propose
that she and Allineham shall run away.
When Mrs. Frazer, however, learns that
Allingham was cognizant of his wife's
presence at the time of her declaration
her disgust for him asserts itself, and
under the protection of an aunt Mrs. Fra
ser sets about to work out her social re
generation.
As in all of Pinero's plays it is the treat
ment rather than the story which makes
"The Benefit of a Doubt" such an interest
ing and clever theatrical piece.
Henry Arthur Jones' drama, "The
Masquerade rs," has been reserved for the
closing week of the engagement â¢at the
Baldwin.
The California.
At the California to-morrow evening
Chauncey Oleott will appear in "Mavour
neen. 1 ' Of this play it is said that it con
tains bright melodies, a lovely story well
told and lots of fun. Of "Mavourneen"
the New York Times says: Chauncey Ol
eott, who plays the part of Terrence
Dwyer, created by the demented Scanlan,
is an actor who has surprised even his
' most intimate acquaintances in this, his
latest attempt. His brogue is delightful
and all in all Manager Pitou would have
had much trouble in procuring a come
dian who could portray the character bet
ter than Oleott, who combines the grace
of Dixey with the sympathetic force of
Scanlan in his prime. His songs were en
cored again and again, the sweet tenor
. voice being listened to with rapt attention.
The cast is an excellent one.
In the Orphenm.
Among the many attractions at the
Orpheum this week will be a troupe of
female acrobats who were discovered in
the Argentine Republic, who have made a
decided hit in New York. They are the
Nelson sisters. They claim to perform all
the featH essayed by male teams. To set
four young women of statuesque build do
ing handstands, flipnaps, four high and
carry, pyramids and other acrobatic feats
is a novelty and should prove a great
draw. Drummond Stanley and Belle Bir
)ect, the musical blacksmiths, will appear
n their funny but interesting specialties.
l?he opening scene is in a blacksmith-shop,
vhich is transformed later into a parlor
tnd a different line of specialties intro
luced. The Black Patti, who has become
|uite famous as a songstress both abroad |
md at home, will appear in operatic and :
imple goags as well. She should prove |
n attractive feature to ail lovers of pleas
ng vocalisms.
Biondi has a new comedy sketch to in
roduce in which even better facilities are
fforded him to display his skill as a trani-
formation artist and his talent as a come
dian. The adventures of a "gay old boy"
are set forth and the scene is laid in a
restaurant, where the gay old man is hay
ing lots of fun. until discovered by his
wife, who at once proceeds to make life
interesting to all. As usual, Biondi plays
all the parts himself, changing from one
character to another with wonderlul ra
pidity. Lydia Yeamans Titus ha? new
songs to introduce. Her clever comedy
work is a feature. Herr Techow's per
forming cats are a star attraction, and
are as interesting to old folks as to the
little men and women who attend the
matinees. Ross Snow has a new song
which he wants to try on the people of
this City, and he will do it this week.
The bill 'is altogether one of the strongest
yet offered. Matinees Wednesday, Satur
day and Sunday.
Grand Opera- House.
This afternoon and evening the final
performances of "Mr. Barnes of New
York," with the popular "California Boy,"
James M. Brophy, in the title role, will be
given at this house. It is to be followed
to-morrow by another very celebrated
drama, McKee Rankin's "The Danites."
It is some years since this excellent piece
has been produced in San Francisco, and
its presentation on Morosco's great stage
with an actor like Brophy in the leading
role of Alexander McKee, is likely to
prove an event. The other strong part in
the story, the dual one of "Billy Pipers"
and "Nancy Williamsi" will be played by
May Nannary, who has been specially en
gaged for the production.
There are some very effective character
parts in the cast which will be taken by
Frank Hatch, Fred Butler and Leslie
Morosco. The latter plays a Chinaman,
"Washee Washee," and is likely to make
a great hit in it. Some new specialties
will be introduced by Gilbert and Goldie,
and little Mina Cook will sing a song
written expressly for her entitled "The
Sun Shines On My Honey." Elaborate
new scenery has been prepared for this
production, which, all things considered,
is likely to create quite a sensation.
Columbia Theater.
Wilton Lactaye will make his first ap
pearance at the Columbia Tneater to
morrow evening with the Frawley
Company as Silas K. Wolcott in "A Gold
Mine," and Louise Thorndyke Boucicault
will also appear. She will take tne role of
Honorable Mrs. Meredith. The attraction
will be strong. The "Gold Mine," which
was written by Brander Matthews and
George A. Jessop, has a pretty story, which
is told as follows:
Silas Wolcott. a Californian, has five
months of successful dickering in London
with Sir Everard Foxwood, an English
capitalist, as to the price of a goid mine
whicn he wishes to sell him. In the course
of his stay he falls in love with Mrs.
Meredith, the baronet's widowed sister.
Through natural good-heartcdness and
love for Mrs. Meredith he parts with his
mine for Â£10,000 to meet the debts of
George Foiwood, a nephew of his inamo
rata. This self-sacrifice, which amounts
almost to heroism, as it takes his last
penny, causes Mrs. Meredith to return his
affections, and the scheme of Sir Everard
Foxwood to turn the purchase of the
mine to his own peculiar advantage at the
expense of his associates is checkmated by
a clever move on the part of Mrs. Mere
dith. An incidental love story is also in
troduced, in which the baronet's daughter
and an Irish member of Parliament are
ttie principals. The cast complete is as
follows:
Silas K. Wolcott of Grasa Valley, Cal.,U. S. A.
Wilton Laclcaye
Gerald Kiordan, M. P. of Baliynookslottery,
Ireland. Frank Worthing
Sir Kverard Foxwood. Kt., senior partner of

The Tivoll.
Next Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Fri
day and Sunday evenings the bill of tne
grand opera season at the Tivoli Opera
house, under tne direction of Gustav
Hinrichs, will include, by a special re
quest, renditions of Leoncavallo's tragic

John J. Raffael, Big. Abramoff, Marcel
Perron and Mme. Casati. The sixth weeK
will be devoted to four performances of
Meyerbeer's ereat opera, "The Hugue
nots," alternated with Balfe's very popular
opera, "The Bohemian Girl."
At. the Chutes.
The Chutes have been liberally patron
ized during the pleasant weather and the
popularity of th c place is on the increase
every day. Tue performances given every
afternoon in the Casino draw large audi
ences, ana "Joe Storms," the educated
orang-outang, has made thousands of
friends during his week's sojourn in the
City. He will be on exhibition for another
week.
The new tunnel on the 3600-foot scenic
railway is completed and the ride is much
more exciting and interesting than for
merly.
As an additional attraction this after
noon at 4:3oo'clock there will be a balloon
ascension and parachute drop by Miss
Leila Adams, the daring aeronaut.
Flashes and Fragments.
The last performance of "Bohemia"
takes place at the Baldwin to-night.
"Old Jed Prouty," with Richard Golden
at the bead of the cast, will be one of the
early attractions on the coast tins season.
One of the new comedies booked for the
Columbia Theater is "Town Topics,"
which made quite a hit in the East last
year.
Delia Fox is securing the services of
some very clever people for her next
season in "The Little Trooper" and "Fleur
de juis."
One of the best scenes in "The Benefit of
the Doubt" takes place between Viola
Allen and Annie Irish, and is beautifully
dramatic.
A new play in which Wilton Laclcaye and
Miss Louise Thorndyke-Boucicault will
appear here with the Frawley Company is
"The Great Unknown."
"The Gay Parisians" is doing the ban
ner business in London, playing to packed
houses nightly at the Vaudeville Theater

Girl," "The Case of Rebellious Susan" and
others of equal success.
The next great New York Lyceum Thea
ter success to be produced by the Frawley
Company at the Colombia Theater is "The
Wife," one of the best plays ever seen
upon the American stage.
Among the three graduates of the Co
lumbia Scnool of Dramatic Art, Miss Edna
Elsmere goes out next season with Peter
Dailey, Lilian Dane with Koster & Bial and
Georgia Stewart with Corinne.

pany that she has ever appeared with.
This is the little star whose mother died
lately and left her over $750,000.
Arthur Wing Pinero's "The*' Benefit of
the Doubt" calis for some exquisite dress
ing by the ladies of the cast. Miss Allen,
Miss Irish and MissÃobson will be gowned
in a way that is unusually attractive.
Among the stars who are coming to the
Baldwin this season, and who will be seen
here in that capacity for the first time, are
Kathryn Kidder, Delia Fox, Otis Skinner
Robert Hiiliard, Beerbohm Tree and John
Hare.
Miss Katheiine White, who has served
two terms as president of the Pianist
Club, will give a recital at Golden Gate
Hall August 10. Dr. Gilbert F. Graham
will assist. Miss White will go to Europe
in the fall.
Morris Rosenthal, pianist, Carl Haber,
violoncellist, the Bohemian String Quar
tet and Miss Canaille Seygard, a new
soprano, have been engaged by Henry
Wolfsohn for performances in the United
States during the coming season.
The great game of cards scene in
"The Masqueraders 1 ' is said to be one of
the most powerful bits of work seen in a
drama in late years. The manner in which
it holds the attention of the audience is
simply amazing. The play will open Au
gust 10. The sale of seats will begin Thurs
day.
A feature of to-day's concert at Golden
Gate Park will be the rendition of. the
"Leap-Year March," dedicated to the
Young Ladies' Saturday Morning Or
chestra, by Mabel Crabtree, a talented
young violinist of Oakland, a member of
the Saturday Morning Orchestra of San
Francisco and also of the Congregational
Orchestra of Oakland.
Rudolph Aronson, during his recent
trip abroad, composed a military march
entitled "For Love or War," dedicated to
the Seventh Regiment, N. G. S. N. Y.
Also a characteristic piece entitled "Pick
aninny Serenade," and a song for May
Irwin entitled "Hor.ey, Meet Me, Do.''
"For Love or War" was performed by the
military bands at the Berlin exposition.
One of the latest local candidates for
public favor in the dramatic line and one
who gives promise is Miss Retena Helen
Owens. She has just finished a course of
htudy in a school of practical acting. Miss
Owens has been engaged for a number of
readings, the first one being before the
Vermonters' Association at Odd Fellows'
Hall, August 14. Miss Owens has excep
tional dramatic talent which has met local
recocnition. Very likely she will be San
Francisco's next contribution to the stage.
At the Baldwin Theafer Monday,
August 17, will be seen "The Gay Pari
sians," which for 200 nights crowded
Hoyt'tj Theater in New York, and for two
months filled the Boston Museum, and
was declared the greatest comedy success
Charles Frohman has yet given to the
public. This comedy is an adaptation of
the French farce "L' Hotel dv Libre Ex
change," which is now in its second
season in Paris. Though in the adaptation
none of the spice has been eliminated,
there is said to be nothing which would
prove offensive to polite ears. The
original company, headed by W. J. Fergu
son, will be seen here. W. J. Ferguson,
James O. Barrows, Charles B. Wells, W.
R.Shirley, Amy Busby, Mrs. E.J.Phil
lips, Margaret Gordon and others will
come with tho "Gay Parisians" company.

S. H. Friedlander, one of the managers
of the Columbia Theater, entertains views
diametrically opposed to those of Freder
ick Warde, published in The Call last
Sunday, in the matter of applause by au
diences during theatrical performances,
and incidentally in the course of an inter
view he displayed his high regard for the
playgoers of San Francisco.
"We are really glad," he began, "to see
The Call take up this question, for it is
one that interests a very large proportion
of the residents of every community, as
well as the members of tbe profession and
the theatrical managers.
"In America," he went on, "there is
actually very little attention given to the
matter of applause to be accorded to pro
fessional people.
"In Europe, and especially in Paris,
they have paid clacquers, whose sole busi
ness it is to applaud a good point and to
assist and encourage and give confidence
to the actor or actress in a new part that
he or she may have assumed, or in a new
play that they may be producing.
"It certainly stimulates an actor to re
ceive applause. It make 3 him feel better
and happier first of all, and applause is
appreciated by the professional people,
because they are thus made to feel that
; heir services are rewardedâ that their
hard study and the close attention given
to their parts are appreciated.
"For instance, take the Frawley Com
pany. There are few people who have
any conception of the amount of work
that the members of this company are
compelled to do for the proper production
and presentation of a new play. They re
hearse every day from 10 o'clock in the
morning, without interruption, until 4
o'clock in the afternoon. They seldom, if
ever, tuka any lunch during the rehear
sals, and all th.3 time they have after the
rehearsal to themselves is between 4
o'clock and their dinner hour, and even
then they must study continually. Then
they have to come to the theater not later
than 7 o'clock to prepare for the night's
performance. And this company has
never even missed a single Sunday re
hearsal since their stay in San Francisco.
"This shows how very little time actors
have for themselves â their arduous duties
and the constant strain upon their minds.
Therefore, after the immense amount of
labor they undergo the public can easily
appreciate how much applause stimulates
and encourages them, particularly when
they make their first appearance on an
opening night or in a new play.
"Now, above all the managers value ap
plause from an audience, as it shows con
clusively that both the play and the
players' work are appreciated and enjoyed,
and that means success for the manager as
well as for the play and the company.
"It is a mistaken idea to imagine that
applause is ever instigated by a reputable
manager, as is sometimes charged. No
first-class house would permit such a thing.
I am sure that in this City it is always
entirely unsolicited and comes from the
hearts of those who witness the play.
"Very often, it is true, players are inter
rupted during a fine scene. I, for one,
like to see that, as it shows in an unmis
takable way that the audience appreciates
and understands good points when they
are made by the players and the inherent
good qualities of the play.
"There is less effort made in fact in all
European cities to advertise plays and
players as a rule than here, but the pro
ductions there have been much superior,
though they are not now. America is
making more rapid progress than Ger
many and other foreign countries in the
matter of the production of good plays.
And while in past years the German actor
was not rewarded with applause, and did
not in fact look for it, he now seeks it,
and is just as anxious for it as the histri
onic artist in this country.
"There is an old saying that the gallery
gods are the best judges of performances.
That may be the case, for they are gen
erally the first to appreciate a good point,
a good actor or actress and the first to
applaud.
"T here are a great many reasons why
people start to leave the auditorium be
fore the curtain falls, " continued Manager
Friedlander, starting on another theme
that had been discussed by Mr. Warde a
week ago.
"First of all we have a great many
patrons from out of town â from Oak:and,
Alameda, Berkeley and from points
within a radius of as much as 100 miles of
San Francisco. As a rule they are com
pelled to mane very close calculations as
to the time for catching trains and
boats, and even certain streetcar* that run
only up to a certain hour. But I have al
ways found that if a performance is over
within a reasonable time and the audi
ence appreciates the play, especially in
San Francisco, the people remain seated
until the curtain drops on the last act.
"In this respect the audiences of Ban
Francisco are superior in quality to those
of any other city in America, especially as
compared to New York City.
"Very oft<*n it is the case that people have
a luncheon or theater party and the hour
for dining or refreshments is set for a cer
tain time and you cannot expect people
to remain seated if they have made en
gagements that require them to leave be
fore the grand finale.
"I wonld add right here that in a gen
eral way San Francisco audiences are much
better behaved than those of any other
city in which I have been associated with
theaters, such as Baltimore, Washington,
Pittsburg, Cincinnati. Louisville. Minne
apolis and St. Paul. The audiences here
are also much more considerate than in
the majority of cities and they are also
intelligently discriminative. They don't
want anything unless it is first-class in
every particular."

Kxplanatlon.
The arrow flits with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it, if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hundredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hi*h" means high barometric pressure and
â  Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and Is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high In thÂ» interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the oosvit. rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars ol
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is Improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warme*
weather may be expected In summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition!
' Â« : ill produce an opposite result.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
. CHICAGO, Ti.tÂ». Aug. I.â Although business
in the speculative ; wheat market was not of im
portance either la volume or check, still the mod
erate transactions displayed quite a strong under
tone. The sentiment on this grain is now decid
edly bullishâ perhaps too much soâ the specu
lative talent would | rather buy than sell. . Owing
to this being a holiday in England there were no
cables from that country. The receipts were
rather free. Chicago had 201 cars &%<i the North
west 395. Export clearances from both oasis for
the week amounted to 2,484. 0C0 bushels, against
3,074,000 bushels for the previous one.
Argentine shipped 80,000 bushels last week.
Local inspections from store amounted to 35,700
bushels and 272,686 bushels cleared at Atlantic
ports In twenty-four hours. Paris quoted 10 cen
times advance on Hour futures. All other conti
nental quota ions were unchanged. In the last
half hour of business buying became free and the
demand contracted. The lowest prices of the day
were then established. September wheat opened
from 69^8Â° to 68% c. sold at 69S/ B e, declined t >
and closed at 68% c. s/ 8 c under yesterday. Esti
mated receipts lor Monday, 260 cars.
CORNâ Achieved nonotorletr 10-dar. It slmp'y
followed wheat, and apparently disregarded all
other Information. The receipts were 1207 cars,
149 more than expected. Withdrawals from store
were heavy at 441,198 bushels. The out insp c
tion being large indicates a free movement east
ward, so that arrivals at this pace are not likely
to cause uncomfortable accumulation. There were
no cables. Export clearances amounted to 226.
--106 bushels. September corn opened irom 24V s {ft
243,4 c, sold at 24% c, declined to and closed at
248/gc. 14c under yesterday. Estimated receipts
for Monday 1600 cars. â 
OA'ISâ Were firmer. The strength was pure!?
sympathetic and business exhibited but ordinary
characteristics. 1 Receipts were 263 cars and .'O,
--000 bushels were taken from store. Export clear
ances were 40.470 bushels. September oats closed
unchanged from yesterday. Estimated receipts
for Monday 400 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady. Cash. 7314 c; September,
72 Vic; December, 74% c; January, 75% c. Re
ceipts were 26 cars.
PROVISIONSâ Another lighter run than ex
pected of hogs was Instrumental In strengthening
the tone of provisions, although the feeling at the
yards was somewhat irregular. â ' Business could
have been better than it was, an all around | com
plaint at the dullness being voiced at the close.

GERMAN CATHOLICS
WILL COLONIZE,
Rev. George D. Heldmann's
Mission to Califor
nia.
TO LOOK FOR THE LAND.
About Three Hundred Families
to Come Here From the
East
THEY WILL GROW SUGAR BEET
One of Miller & Lux's Ranches in
Monterey County Is a Fa
vorite Site.
The Rev. George D. Heldmann, pastor
of St. Paul's German Catholic Church,
Chicago, is on his way to California on a
tour of inspection preparatory to estab
lishing a large colony of German Catholics
in this State. Ho was expected to have
arrived in San Francisco last Friday, but
' became indisposed on the road and stopped
for a rest.
The coming of Father Heldmann to Cali
fornia is regarded by the leading men
among his people here and in St. Louis
and Chicago with considerable interest, as
the enterprise of establishing a colony
with 200 to 400 families has been a subject
of discussion for some time. The plan is
to bring the colonists from Chicago and
St. Louis and establish them in some fei- |
tile valley of this State where they may
all live together and earn an independent
livelihood on the land.
It is viewed as the most satisfactory so
lution of the problem of improving the
destiny of a people who naturally drift
into cities under the influences of present
social and economic conditions.
To Father Heldmann will be largely left 1
the selection of a site for the colony, the ]
choosing of colonists and subsequent direc- j
tion of the colony, and, as much depends
on him, his people await with eagerness
any report he may make on his examina
tion.'
It is the present intention to have the j
colony produce sugar-beets on an exten
sive scale, though the culture of fruits, j
vegetables and cereals will also form an i
important part of the work. In general a i
varied class of farming is to be adopted, j
while the beet is to be a staple product.
Immediately a site is purchased and â¢
the colonists begin to settle thereon, a \
church and schoolhouse will be built and j
c priest take churge of the spiritual wel
fare of the colonists. Only Germans, j
members of the Catholic church, can bo i
admitted to the colony, the object being
to bring together those people wtio other
wise might be scattered far and near with
out opportunity such as they will have in
the colony.
For two months the local agents of the
colony have been investigating various
large tracts in California, with the result
that a desirable site in San Bernardino
County, a large ranch belonging to Miller
<fc Lux. in Monterey County, and a tract
in Mendocino County, will be examined
by Father Heldmann. The Monterey
property is said to offer the best induce
ments in regard to climate, soil, water,
facilities for transportation, etc.
The California Volksireund, the only
German Catholic paper on the Pacific
Coast, has been publishing for the past six
weeks a series of interesting articles on
California, and these papers had the effect
of inducing Father Heldmann to investi
gate what the State offers for a colony for
his people.
The zealous Driest, who is working in
this direction for the best interests of
Catholic citizens of German birth or de
scent, is enthusiastic over the project.
The idea is one that has been discussed in
magazine and review articles, and has
been the subject of books. It was tried
with different success in the Western
States where the natural conditions were
not nearly so favorable as those of Cali
fornia. Tne Catholic Slovenian colony in
Mendocino County, after which the new
one will be conducted, has been successful
so far, and the promoters of the projected
enterprise are sanguine of success.

THE BANKS TRIM SAILS,
In the Presence of Disturbed
Financial Conditions They
Go Slow.
Commercial Bankers Loan Only on
Current and Quick-Paying
Business.
A. Everett Ball, the attorney, stated
yesterday that he had failed to secure a
loan for a client on securities that have
always been regarded as substantial. The
reason assigned for the refusal to give a
loan of money on a safe mortgage was
that under the present disturbed condition
of finances bankers did not wish to part
with coin as freely as in the past.
'â¢I went to a commercial bank," said
Mr. Ball, "and I said: 'I want some
money on gilt-edged securities.'
" 'We are not lending money now,' the
banker told me. 'Until this silver ques
tion is settled none of the banks will part
with money. None of them are loaning.'
"Then I asked him if the banks were
growing scared â if they wanted to para
lyze tne business of the City. I was told
that the banks did not wish to take
chances, and consequently were refusing to
loan money. On the contrary, they were
calling in many loans. Of course, no mat
ter what comes the country is not going to
smash anyhow. If a silver President is
elected his election does not mean that
the country must adopt free silver. Not
at all. The President has only the veto
power. Congress must pass upon the
question. The election is nothing more
than an announcement of the wish of the
people, whatever that may mean."
President Lilienthal of the Anglo-Am
erican Bank, who was mentioned by Mr.
Ball as the banker who declined to make a
loan on approved security, gave a more
hopeful and a brighter view of the subject.
"The commercial banks," said he, "have
decided on a more conservative course
than formerly in view of the financial out
look consequent on the political situation.
Still we are loaning money for business
enterprises. We are not at all taking a
stand to clog the machinery, to paralyze
commerce, but simply confining ourselves
to operations that will give returns before
the election of a President takes place.
"Notwithsianding the specific contract
act of this State the introduction of free
silver would affect transactions which go
outside of the State, and for that reason
there is no telling how accounts would be
settled should silver legislation prevail.
Personally I believe firmly that McKiniey
will be elected.
"There is no hesitation to loan for turn
ing of business that is quickly settled,
such as the movement in wheat and fruit
for instance, but the commercial banks
are not disposed to make loans on mort
gages or on anything on long terms. It
behooves them to keep themselves in such
condition as to be prepared for the worst
that might happen. Credit is gone tem
porarily. A man must have money if he
wants to build a house, for bankers are
confining themselves to transactions
within a short period, that is, to business
on which money can be collected in sixty
or ninety days."

dent Charles B. Haven of the Under
writers has also advised the Merchants'
Association that two delegates to the
charter convention will be appointed from
that body on next Tuesday, the day of the
meeting of their board.
Secretary Peixotto of the San Francisco
Boys' Club Association stated that the
boys are deeply interested in the new
charter and wished to send delegates to
the charter convention.
At a special meeting of the board of di
rectors of the Merchants' Association, held
recently, it was decided to invite 112 asso
ciations of this City to send two delegates
each. This makes 178 associations of San
Francisco who have been invited to tane
part in the convention. Many encouraging
letters have been received from various
clubs throughout the City, and the con
vention promises to be one of the most
successful representative bodies of citizens
ever held in tbis metropolis.
FUTURE CITIZENS.
Annual Report of the Immigration
Commissioner of This
Port.
United States Immigration Commis
sioner Walter P. Stradlev has just
finished his annual report for the year
ending June 30, which will be forwarded
to the Immigration Department at once.
It contains considerable interesting infor
mation as to the character of the foreigners
who come to the United States through
this port. During the year there were
only 1411 immigrants arrived. Of these
1096 were male, leaving 315 females. The
law requires the Commissioner to learn
the amount of money that these arrivals
possess, so as- to prevent them from be
coming public charges and to prevent the
pauper element from landing.
Mr. Stradley's figures show that the
1411 arrivals brought with them nearly a
quarter of a million dollars, or, to be ex
act, $231,660. One female was preyented
from landing and one was returned. The
occupations given show a large Dercuntage
of professionals, 9 being clergymen, and
skilled workmen as here seen: Profes
sionals 43, skilled workmen 307, unskilled
and miscellaneous 635, no occupation, in
cluding women and children, 421.
The principal countries from which the
immigrants came and the aggregate sums
of money brought by each race was as fol
lows: Europe, males 439, females 146â585,
$159,070. Of these 42 could neither read nor
writs. Central America, males 4, females
â5, $730; 1 could not read or write.
Mexico, males 51, females 77â128, $2902.
Of these 22 could not read or write. Brit
ish North America, males 14, females 6â 20,

A BRILLIANT DISPLAY,
Crowds Admire the New Store
of the Columbian Woolen
Mills.
A Progressive House That Has Made
Rapid Strides Since Its
Foundation.
The past two evenings passers-by on
Market street, at the junction of Eddy and
Powell, have had their attention attracted
to the brilliant electrical illumination of
the building at the northwest corner of
Powell and Eddy streets. It is indeed a
brilliant display and is typical of the en
terprise of the house making it â the
Columbian Woolen Mills.
This house that has recently become
better known under the name of the pro
prietors, 8. N. Wood & Co., is one of the
foremost clothing - houses of this City.
They have pursued new and up-to-date
methods in their business relations with
tne public, and as a result the house now
occupies an enviable position in the
clothing and merchant tailoring trade in
this City.
Although their principal place of busi
ness is and has been at 541 Market street
it is not out of the range of possibilities
that their new store will become the cen
ter of their already extensive and rapidly
increasing business in this City. Their
new store is light, bright and airy, and at
night the illumination is so extensive
that it is equal fully to the brilliancy of
daylight. Massive plate-glass windows on
both street sides give the storeroom u:i
equaled facilities in the matter of light,
while in the interior arrangement every
modern device has been taken advan
tage of.
The Columbian Woolen Mills first
started in this City about two years ago,
and since then their progressive business
methods have been such as to give them a
position in the front rank in the mercan
tile world of Ban Francisco.
NO ATTACK MEANT.
Judge Joachimgen Explains Why He
I ined a Street Speaker.
Judge Joachimsen, who was censured in
a resolution passed Friday night by the
San Francisco Labor Council for having
fined Mark Leiter, a socialist street
speaker, for obstructing the streets, when
shown a copy of the resolutions in yester
day's Call, was at a loss to account for the
council's action.
"The man," explained the Judge yester
day, "was arrested for having obstructed
the streets in violation of an ordinance of
the City and County, and acting in my
judicial capacity I had to punish the vio
lation. The minimum fine, however, was
imposed.
"I have no fault to find with the opin
ions or doctrines expressed by the speaker.
As an American citizen he had a perfect
right to believe as he chose and promul
gate his opinions in a proper manner.
But in this case an ordinance was vio
la tea and it was my duty to punish the
â¢â¢Tense.
"It was said that the Salvation Army
had been holding a meeting unmolested at
the same spot where Leiter was speaking.
But the Salvation Army had a permit
from the Chief of Police, and if the people
who held this meeting had obtained a per
mit they would not have Deen disturbed.
If they had applied to the Chief and the
purposes of their meeting were legal, they
could have secured tbe necessary permit
beyond the peradventure of a doubt. 1 '

HOW CHINESE LAND.
Habeas Corpus Cases Increase Since
the Dismissal of Dick Williams
From the Service.
For the month of July United States
Commissioner Heacock passed on seven
Chinese habeas corpus case.s, and for the
fiscal year ending June SO thirty-two
celestials sought to land at this port by
process of law.
During the first month of the fiscal
year Commissioner Heacock's business
.was nearly one-fourth as large as that of
the previous twelve months. This may in
reality mean nothing, but it is reearded
in customs circles as decidedly signifi
cant. It is attributed by Federal officials
to the dismissal of Dick Williams and
suspension of his friend Louie Quong.
In April there was one habeas corpus
case, while May presented a clean docket.
In June Commissioner Heacock passed on
two cases. Williams was suspended May
18, so it may be readily seen that the
habeas corpus business has rapidly in
creased since that time.
Of the thirty-nine cases heard during
the last thirteen months fully 80 per cent
have succeeded in landing. It is a well
known fact that if a Chinese has sufficient
money to institute legal proceedings to
secure his landing, his effort succeeds in
nearly every instance. It is an easy mat
ter to trump up evidence, and it is upon
evidence alone that the court bases an
opinion. Assistant District Attorney
Schlessinger says the fault is with the law,
which admits almost any and every kind
of evidence. Until that is remedied, he
says, the majority of habeas corpus cases
will continue to be nothing short of a
farce.
SURPRISE PARTY,
Reception in Honor of Miss
Smith of Utah.
A very pleasant surprise party was tendered

28, at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Harry By
non, 148 Fourteenth street, whom she has

lin. Singing and selections were rendered by

per was served at midnight, after wnich
dancing was indulged in until the wee sma'
hours. Those present were: Mr. and Mrs. H.
Bynon, Mr. and Mrs. George C. Pinkham, Mr.

SUICIDES DURING JULY,
Thirty-One Days' Grewsome
Record of the City
Morgue.
More People Committed Self-Murder
Than During Any Month of tne
Past Sixteen Years.
The number of suicides reported at th e
Morgue during the month of July were
considerably in excess of any previous
month within the last sixteen years. In
addition to this grewsome record, July 24
enjoys the distinction of mora suicides
than any other day in the history of the
institution. In all sixty-nine cases were
reported, and of this number it was found
necessary to perform forty-one autopsies.
Of the sixty-nine cases reported at the
More;o thirty-four were found to have
committed suicide. The methods adopted
by the self-murderers, together with the
number in each cas>e, were as follows:
Drowning ten, gas nine, poison eight, gun
shot seven ; total thirty-four. The suicide
record for the first six months of the cur
rent year is seen below: January five,
February seven, March fifteen, April
twelve, May fifteen, June twenty-one.
The remainder of the sixty-nine cases,
together with the causes so far as known,
for the month of July is as follows:
Natural 19, accidents 9, murder 2, un
known 5. Of the deaths by accident three
were traced directly to the Market-street
Railroad Company, while two met an un
expected end at Sutro's pleasure resort.
Taken as a whole, Coroner Hawkins
views the month of July as the most grew
some of his administration. While other
months have exceeded July in total num
ber of deaths reported, none are nearly so
baa in point of suicides and murders.
The combined record for the first seven
months of tbe current year reads: Janu
ary 52, February 60, March 66, April 76,
May 64, June 76, July 69.
