VOLUME LXXX.-NO. 168.
MINERS DEMAND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A FEDERAL BUREAU FOR THEIR GREAT INDUSTRY
EXPERT SKILLJS REQUIRED.
Neglect and Injustice Are
in the Present
System.
* INTERIOR OFFICERS ARE
NOT MINERS,
Important Interests Are Handled
: by Men Who Know Nothing
;. of Mineralogy.
"THE CALL" ADVOCATES THE
MINERS' PROPOSITION.
It Is Simple Justice That Industries Which Affect
Every State in the Union Should Be
Cared For by a Bureau in the
Charge of Experts.
California miners have recently taken
active steps to induce Congress to establish
a department of the General Government
for the dispatch of business pertaining to
mineoand mineral lands. Their late con
vention in this City ottered resolutions to
that end, reciting the importance of the
industry, pointing out some of the defects
â¢ of the present system and urging that the
vast interests involved are entitled to
more consideration than has been granted
ttnaer the present circumlocutory, nu
, . skillful and unjust system.
The Call believes that this demand of
the miners is just, and will gladly do all
. in its power to further their purpose.
The case was recently put in the follow
.â¢me terse manner by the journal of the
'. Northwest Mining Association, and the
same sentiment has been voiced by im
portant organizations all over the country :
From all over the country comes the state
._ merit that a department of mines snould be
created; to be a Cabinet office and to have a
p. ace besiile the other Cabinet offices. Tne
mining Industry has become so important
that it can no longer De properly served by
.the Interior Department. No man can be a
miner and an aericuaurist; nor is it fair to
â¢ suppose that the Secretary of the Interior is at
.one and the sani* time familiar with both.
That official has quite enough to attend to In
ternal affairs outside of mining as he has
outside of agriculture. He is not a miner nor
â¢does he pretend to be, and yet he is called
â¢ upon to promote and equitably adjust mining
ffrid it-* irregularities. The Northwest Mining
Association is anxious to get the views of
tho-e who may be interested in mining, and
:' after due deliberation will, ii thought proper,
Â«ri>e that the department of iriiut-g and mining
. â¢be created, and a well-qualified person ap
pointed to occupy the office. The West and
South are vital iy interested in this matter,
and many 01 the Eastern and Central States
are also; thereiore, there will be little opposi
tion to the movement.
It is a common and general complaint
of miners that the men in the General
Land o<fice and Department of the In
". terior are ignorant of the fundamental
principles of mining, and it is claimed
â  that none bpt experts can properly ad
â¢minister the vast business that penainsto
American mineral lands, and that it is un
just to one of the most important indus
tries* of the country, one second only to
agriculture and manufactures, that it
should remain forever in swaddling
.clothes.
The same spirit of dissatisfaction with
antiquated and inadequate methods tnat
lound expression at the recent convention
has been growing in intensity and spirit
for several years. Miners everywhere
â¢ 'have realized that they are at a creat dis
' advantage when seeking justice through a
â¢ .department whose members are in no
' sense mineral experts. President G. B.
'Dennis of the Northwest Mining Assooa
. tion recently said in a public address:
In the early history of and shortly after the
rganization of this association. Colonel N. E.
Lins.ey introduced a resolution which was in
effect the establishment of a Cabinet office in
the United States Government which should
be known as the Department of Mining. This
resolution was ably supported by Captain C.
H. Thompson and others. A paper advocating
â  the measure was read dy A. F. Parker 01
Grangeville, Idaho, at our official convention
February 22 last. The association feels that
the time has come when the great mining in
terests of the United States should have the
same recognition officially by this Government,
In i he way of a Cabinet office and officer, as an
other department of commerce or state, and to
that end will labor hard to accomplish it. Its
action has borne fruit, in that the mining
associations of Caliiornia and Colorado have
Joined forces with us and will help us carry to
success this meritorious movement. The office
J of Minister uf Mines for the British Province*
"^has proven a great boon to mining there, and
it is with the same intent that we endeavor to
c-stablisn the same thing for these United
Stales. Our great mining intere-ts are fast
awakening to its importance and demand
that it receive at the hands 01 the United
States Government that recognition wnich
shall place it upon a parity with other com
mercial industries. We hope to be successful.

we may intelligently understand thedifSculties
to be encountered' In the development of it.
That the prospector may be aided In nil labori
ous work we have urged our second vice
presidents to, a* soon as practicable by actual
surrey, mitee topographical maps of their dis
tricts, and in the majority oi cases it is being
done. *j' C-jitS,'> , -.-}â "â¢.â¢" â â â  t'.,-'-'-. '.'â '. Â,.,;..,
.We hope in this direction to accomplish much
in the way of advancing the material and
practicable development of the country. 'We
know that our mining fraternity possess J that
indomitable spirit, determination and effort
that would result in the country's develop
ment finally, Irrespective of maps, trails or
wagon roads. Oar purpose, therefore, is to
make the road of travel easier and live hap
pier during the travel.
The subject was deemed worthy of an
extended mention in the report of the
Mining Bureau of California to Governor
Budd. State Mineralogist J. J. Crawford
has taken it up and given it aspeci.-i para
graph under the title of "Department of
Mines." His report containing this in
teresting 'review is now in the hands of
the State Printer, but the paragraph in
question was taken yesterday from the ad
vance proof-sheet. It is as follows:
"Department of , Mines âIt is confi
dently believed that the mineral Indus
trie* of the whole country would be
greatly promoted' should a Department
of Mines be created in the Government.
The mineral output for 1895 of all the
States amonnted to '8622,330,723, and
It neenn almost Incredible that nuch an
important industry should be without
representation in the Cabinet. The
var ous bureaus relating to mining are,
scattered through the ( several existing
departments, and as a matter of
economy as well as a means of stimu
lating and encouraging more full and
systematic development and research,
such a department should be created.
Properly it should embrace archaeology,
botany, ethnology, geography, geology,
irrigation, mining, palaeontology, etc"
Hon. Aaron F. Parker of Idaho recently,
read an able paper on the subject before
the Northwest Mining Association,where
in, among other things, he ; showed the
inadequacy of" the present . method of
handling mining matters by < the Govern
ment departments that have these i mat
ters in charge. Among other things, he
said :
Operating in gold mines, and deprived of the
opportunity; of ', personal consultation with
lawyers learned In the technicalities of min
ing law, except by the slow ana unsatisfactory
process of the ; United ; States Â» mail service, - I
have always applied to the Honorable Â«Secre
tary of the Interior at Washington for such
Information as I needed from time to time. j-. A
point came up last year involving the inter
pretation of the mining laws of the United
Slates. I wrote to the Honorable Secretary of
the Interior in regard to it. HiÂ» construction
of the law agreed with mine. There was no
difference of opinion between us. : The points
in full were, underscored in the letter of. the*
Honorable Secretary. Later on, being desirous
of observing the strict letter and spirit of the
law for the protection of my mining interests,
I addressed a letter to the Honorable Commis
sioner.' of the } General " Land Office;: and I re
ceived a reply directly contrary to the views
expressed by the Honorable Secretary of the
Interior. - '.-â "..-â "â  , ' " "
In further correspondence I have come to
the conclusion that the. officials of the Interior
Deportment and of the General Land Office are
entirely i norant of , mining matters. A little
later on, in order to obtain further necessary
information; I addressed a letter to the Honor
able Secretary of the Interior, propounding a
series of questions of general interest to the
mining fraternity. That was over a year 'ago,
hut up to this time I have not' received any
reply. J Now, all these things have a tendency
to harass the life out of honest men and to re
tard the development of the mining industry. â '
I bring them to the notice of this association;
to-day in the hope ; that some of .its members
may be able to suggest a remedy.
Personally, I have ; come 'to _; the conclusion
that the mining industry is important enough
to nave a representative, in the Federal Cabi
net, and, therefore, I . ask :. this association to
adopt as its settled policy the idea of < fighting
for,the creation of a new department of the
Federal Government, to bo known as the Da- ,
"Resolved, That the California Miners' Association strongly and
urgently desires the appointment of a Cabinet officer to be known as the
Secretary of Mines and Mining/
pertinent of Mining, with a Western mining;
man at its head, who shal! be a Cabinet officer,
with control ot all matters relative to the inin
ine indusiry. With such, a department we
will not have rulings which once stood the
test of courts overturned in a day without
rhyme ot reason, nor will we be longer sub
jected to tbe dangers of an Honorable Secre
tary of the Interior reversing his own rulings,
as has been done in recent times.
It will perhaps prove startling to per
sona who have never investigated the sub
ject to know what a vast proportion of the
business of the country is embraced in tbe
coal and mineral interests of the Union.
Rich mineral deposits exist in almost
every State of the Union. While gold and
silver greatly predominate in the Jar
West, it should be borne In mind that
coal, lead, copper, iron, zinc and like prod
ucts are abundant in the East and that
the accusat on cannot be made that tbe
call for such a bureau or department as
that to be devoted to metallurgy is sec
tional and Western. The following figures
are oi interest in this connection:
The total value of the mineral and metal
production of tbe United States in 1895, as
shown in the tables of the cen-us,
amounted to the enormous sum of $678,
-000 OOO.which compares with a similar total
of $531,211,000 or 1894. showing a total in
crea-e of more than $96,000, or 16 per cÂ«nt,
for the year.
According to Rothwetls great statistl
ca. work or. the mineral industries of the
Uniied States coal is perhaps the most im
portant of all tbe mineral products, con
stituting nearly 32 per cent, or nearly one
third of the entire production. Pig iron
holds the second place, its value being 16
per cent of the total. These two products
Entitled to Representation in the Cabinet.
The mining industry of the country, comprising all manner of mmmg â coal, iron, quick
silver and the precious metals â is of such magnitude that it should have a Cabinet officer, one
peculiarly fitted by education and otherwise to take charge of an industry second only to that of
agriculture. Under present conditions the Secretary of the Interior has supervision over that
vast industry, and he is usually a person not versed in its requirements. In consequence the
ruling of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, who is subordinate to the Secretary of
the Interior, makes the rulings of his department entirely at variance with the requirements of
the mining industry and thereby hampers persons in acquiring title to mineral lands.
JACOB H. NEFF.
have values far exceeding those of any
other on the list and there is a wide gap
between iron ana gold, which comes third
on the list. Its proportion is less than 7
per cent of the total, being less than half
of the iron and one-fourth of the coal. Pe
troleum is fourth in place, furnishing 6.3
per cent of the total value. Copper is fifth
with 5.5 per cent. It will be seen that coal
and iron together formed 47.8 per cent, or
nearly one-half of the production in value.
Silver is well down on thÂ« list, its produc
tion being only 4.5 of the total.
The production of coal in the United
States in 1895 reached a total of 195,761,312
tons, the largest amount ever reported for
a single year.
The domestic production of copper in
1895 was 3*6,453,950 pounds, a gain of
nearly 10 per cent over the output
of 1894.
ThÂ«* miners have for years been patient
in the face of many wrongs, which were
incident to tne ty^tem of placing an im
portant industry under the control of men
necessarily unacquainted with tbe mining
business. Year after year the idea has
grown in the minds of leading thinkers
! that there should be some growth, some
| expansion of the system to meet the re
quirements of a new era.
Various other improvements have been
I made in various department of the Gov-
I ernment to Weep pace with progress, and
! the question naturally arises why should
mining alone suffer from the evils of an
inadequate system?
In proposing the new improvements the
miners realize that they will meet with
spirited opposition from powerful inter
ests.
Necessarily the Secretary of the Interior
will object to surrendering so much of his
jurisdiction to a new officer, the Commis
sioner of the Land Orticp will oppose it for
the same reason, while the geological sur
chveyors will hang tenaciously to so mv
of the patronage and power as belongs to
them under the present regime.
To-day when miners po to the various
departments with their claims they are
confronted with many obstacles. At the
outset they meet men who are ignorant
of the matters they come to consult about,
and they find those men preoccupied with
other affairs. The data, laws and rulings
of the department are in a contradictory
and inconvenient condition, and it is often
found that there are so many delays as to
seriously embarrass business. It is for
these, among other reasons, that the Cali
fornia miners are now taking the aggres
sive in the movement to have tbe Federal
Government recognize their interests.
It is tbe purpose of the miners to organ*
ize at an early date and fight vigorously
tat recognition in their business. It is
believed they will have the full concur
rnce of men in allied industries in every
State, and that something substantial may
be accomplished in the next year.
One of thp schemes proposed to facili
tate the matter is to have a delegation of
exper> mining men visit Washingion and
lay their views before the proper com
mittees of Congress, before the President
and others in authority. It is deemed im
portant that there be the most thorough
possible co-operation in the matter.
Information and sueeestions ought to
be sent to L. K. Armstrong, Spokane,
Wash., or to Charles G. Yale iv San Fran-
Cisco. The Nortbwest Mining Associa
tion is active in promoting the matter, and
any suggestions might be sent to it.
The following table, computed by
Charles G. Yale, statistician of the Mint,
shows the value of tbe precious metals of
California for the year 1895:

The value ot other minerals produced
in California is as treat as the total ot gold
and silver, and all would be under the
general charge of the proposed Depart
ment of Mines.
A study of the general mineral produc
tions of the United States, as shown by
reports of the Department of Mining
Statistics, shows that States not gener
ally accounted as producing mineral
products are ricn in such deposits, hence
nearly every section of the TJnien would
reap benefits from the proposed depart
ment
In 1883 the production of pigiron for the
United States amounted to 7,124,502 tons,
and came from twenty-six Siates, promi
nent among which were New York, Penn
sylvania, Illinois, Wisconsin, Maryland,
Alabama and Indiana. In the same year
the copper productions of the Lake Su
perior region alone was nearly 115,000,000
tons, that of the entire Union being
330.000,000.
,< As -i it : is proposed to i have ; the bureau
take charge of coal as well as minerals it
is interesting to note that the production
of coal for 1893 amounted to nearly 129,
-000,000 tons. . :'.\

The total value of the non-metallic
mineral products, such as bituminous and
anthracite coals, gypsnra, sulphur, lime,
grarhite, etc., is $358,839,804 for the year
1893. These values show, in a general
way, the vast magnitude of the interests
which the miners propose to have placed
in the hands of a bureau of experts for the
purpose of promoting the general welfare
of the people in industries dependent upon
mineral products.

According to the statistical reports of
the Government the gold output of the
United States is of great magnitude, and
ought to be of sufficient importance to
elicit attention.
The gold product of the United States
in 1894 was 1.910,813 ounces, fine, of the
value of $39,500,000, or 171,490 ounces, j
fine, valued at $3,545,000, more than in !
1893. The yield of from the mines i
ot the United States in 1894 was the
largest since 1878, when it amounted to
$51,200,000.
The aunual output of gold from the
mines of the United States is suaceptible
of very close approximation; for of all the
gold produced in the country in any year
part goes to private refineries, to be
there refined; part is deposited at the
mints and assay offices of the United
States, and part is exported in domestic
gold ores ana in domestic copper and ar
gentiferous matte for reduction abroad.
The sum of these several items, all of
which are accurately Known, and of which
that of the gold bars reported by private
refineries is by far the gre test, constitutes
the gold output of the country in the
year.
Besides this, there is another way in
which the gold product of the United
States in any year may be ascertained,
viz. : by the disposition made of the do
I PRtfc^JTIVE CENTS. a
\ mestic builion and auriferous domestic
ores.
Part of the domestic bullion is disposed
of at the mints and assay offices, being de
posited at these institutions; part of it is
exported; part is aisposed of by private
refineries to manufacturers and jewelers
for employment in the arts; besides
which some gold is exported in domestic
gold ores and domestic copper matte.
It is to be remarked, however, that an
ascertainable amount of foreign gold bul
lion is contained in the private refineries'
product of fine gold bars deposited at
United States mints and assay offices,
and is by them classified as "domestic
production." This foreign bullion must
of course be deducted from the total
amount of the gold the disposition of
which is classified above.
A HEAVY DEFAULTER.
A Trusted Employe of a New York Bank
and $200,000 Are Suddenly
Missing.
NEW YORK. N. V., Nov. 14. -Richard
D. Wood, for th c past six years assistant
cashier of the Metropolitan National Bank
(in liquidation since 1884), is wanted on
the charge of appropriating $60,000 of the
bank's funds.
He is also said to have used $40,000 be
longing to his father-in-ldw, John J. Law
rence; $16,000 belongine to his aunt, Mrs.
William Lawrence, and a considerable
sum belonging to his cousin, "Jack"
Hart, all of Sparkill, N. V., with whom ho
was associated in the livery business.
It is believed that when the full extent
of Wood's peculations become known
they will amouut to a sum iv the neigh
borhood of $200,000.
It was said that no trace of thÂ« man has
been found, but that the efforts to catch
him win be prosecuted with all possible
vigor.
"When the bank failed in 1884 Wood was
paying teller, and subsequently acted as
assistant cashiar in winding up its affairs.
He had exclusive charge of the bank's
vaults and attended to all the outdoor
work. It is said he took advantage of
these facts to operate in the stock market,
and recently he always went on the wrong
side.
Three months ago Wood became ill.
Being unable to transact his business it
fell into the hands of his old friends in
the office, men who looked upon Wood as
a brother. Then came discoveries that
opened their eyes. Once or twice Wood
succeeded in getting down to the office,
but was too Ii 1 to keep it up. One day
the vaults were opened, and then it was
lt-arncd that securities liad disappeared.
Wood lived with his family iv fair but
not showy style at Piedmont.
Wood is about 55 years old and has a

MAJOR McKINLEY`S
VERY HARD TASK
Questions of the Selection
of a Cabinet Are Con
sidered.
Ex-President Harrison Would
Make a Most Acceptable
State Secretary.
RUMORS CONCERNING HANNA.
And the Business of tbe Ccuntry
Continues to Boom and Pros
perity Is Dawning.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Nov. 14.âChair
man Hanna, General W. M. Osborne, sec
retary of the New York headquarters, and
National Committeeman H. C. Payne,
chairman of the Chicago headquarters,
held a conference to-day in this city.
After the conference General Osborne was
asked:
"Has McKinley commenced considering
Cabinet possibilities?"
"I guess that it is about the only thing
agitating his mind nowadays. He real
izes tt>at he has a hard task on his hands."
"Would ex-President Harrison be ac
ceptable to the McKinleyites for the Sec
retary of State portfolio?"
"Most certainly, but I do not believe he
would accept it. His law partner has
given it out that Mr. Harrison would not
be in a position to accept tbe honor."
"All kinds of rumors are in tbe air about
the Secretary of the Treasury. It goes
without saying that Mr. Hanna can have
anything that he warns. The point is,
does he want anything?"
"It may take Mr. McKinley until a
week before his inauguration before he
will have decided on the complete make
up of his Cabinet."
"If the permanent headquarters goes to
"Washington will you be in charge?"
"The question of a permanent head
quarters, as far as I know, has not yet
been positively decided upon. The mat
ter rests solely with Mr. Hanna. How
ever, if Washington is chosen, I presume,
as secretary of the National Committee, 1
would probably be located there."

BAGLISH PRESS COMMENT
Tar lous View* at to the Bearing of the
â¢ â ' Election on Money. '-'
LONDON, Esq., Nov. 14.â The Statist,
discussing the monetary situation, says:
"It is now unlikely that gold will go to
America. r .. Cheaper money in New York
has stopped the rush ;of exports, ana the
United â¢ States .is also purchasing more
freely abroad., The balance of trade in
the near future will again be against the
United States."
The Economist says: ''The uncertain
course of affairs .in the United States is
still the dominating influence in the city,
and the growing reports of the immediate
effects of the election of McKinley are not
reliable. The election may restore things
to the condition they were in prior to the
silver agitation, but thai does not iruplv
that the volume of trade will assume un
paralleled dimensions."
JEWISH WOMEN GATHER
A New York Congress A'ong
Religious and Philan
thropic Lines.
One Objct Is to Uproot Skepticism,
Which Is Spreading Among
Young H brews.
KEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 14.â The con
vention of the National Council of Jewish
Women will open to-morrow in the
Tuxedo Hotel and will continue until
Friday. It is the first convention of
Jewish women to be held in America.
Toe labors of the council are along the
lines of religion and philanthropy. The
work in religion includes lectures and a
study of the Bible, while that in philan
thropy involves prevention rather than
alleviation of suffering and want, and the
organization of charities. One purpose of
the organization is to root out tne spirit
of skepticism which is spreading among
the youngest Hebrews.
The council is the offspring of the Con
gress of Women at the Columbian Expo
sition in 1893. and is called the National
Council of Women. Temporary organiza
tion was effected by Mrs. Hannah G.
Solomon, as chairman of the general com
mivtee, soou after the congress. Her
efforts broujrbt about a Jewish. women's
congress at the parliament of religion^ at
the exposition, and the permanent organi
zation which resulted from the Jewish
Women's Congress was the National
Council. It now has a total membership
of 3000, with forty-six sections, two of
which are in Canada.
The officers, who are residents of Chi
cago, are as follows: President, Mrs. H.
Solomon; vice-president, Mrs. E. Mandel;
treasurer, Mrs. H. J. t?eis; corresponding
secretary, Miss Sadie American; recording
secretary, Mrs. T. J. Wolf.
Eighteen States are represented in the
council and each nas a vice-president.

HOTEL METROPOLE TO BRIGHTON.
An Exciting Road Race for Horse/ess Cars
and Carriages for a Distance of
Forty-Seven Miles.
LONDON, Exg., Nov. 14.â An immense
crowd assembled in the vicinity of the
Hotel Metropole to-day to witness the de
parture of the motor cara in their race
from the Hotel Metropole to Brighton,
forty-seven miles from London, the. crush
being so great that the roads were blocked
and the police bad considerable difficulty
in clearing the way. Fifty ear 9or car
riages started, led by a pilot landau steered
by Harry Lawson,
The landau wa3 followed by Levassor's
phaeton, which won the horseless carriage
race from Paris to Marseilles, and then
came carriages of various styles, including
Daunter cars, bu&es, hansoms, American
Duryea carriage?, oil and steam motor
cycles, etc.
The spectators were very enthusiastic
and indulged in uproarious cheering as
the motors started. After the vehicles
got clear of the crowd they went off at a
fine pace. The steering was admirable,
and when the carriages became blocked
by the ordinary ti-affic of the street 3 their
pace was checked instantly. The race
was won by the American Duryea motor,
whic'i was the nrst to arrive at Brighton.
The distance was covered in four hours.
The cars arrived irregularly. The pro
cession which it was proposed to hold
upon arrival of the cars was abandoned in
consequence of a heavy fall of rain.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1896.
BRYAN IS YET
BUSY TALKING
Addresses Made to the
Residents of Lincoln
on Silver.
Nebraskans Warmly Thanked
for Their Loyal Support
of the Candidate.
FIGHTING FOR THE IUITJRE.
Advocates of Free Coinage Told lo
Keep Up the Agitation Uatil
Success Comes.
LINCOLN, Necr., Not. 14.â An audience
of. ladies which packed the Funke Opera
house from pit to dome greeted W. J.
Bryan this afternoon. The address, which
was brief, was eiven by invitation of the
Mary Bryan Silver Club of Lincoln.
Mr. Bryan congralulated the ladies on
the part they had taken as the friends' of
bimetallism, and expressed his heartfelt
appreciation for the efforts made in his
behalf. Aftef referring to the campaign
in a general way, the speaker said that
among the new things of this campaign
was the speaking to audiences of those
who could not vote. But, he said, he
lived to talk to women on political sub
jects. He referred pleasantly to the in
fluence cf women over husbands. He
would rather at the beginning of a cam
paign have the wife than the husband on
his side. There was a chance then of
getting both. Speaking of the tendency
to keep out of politics because of fear of
contamination, Mr. Bryan said:
"Politics is going to stay in this coun
try, because, although we ignore politics,
we cannot get out of politics. We should
prepare ourselves and our children so poli
tics may be so pure that anybody can take
part without being contaminated."
Mr. Bryan was warmly applauded
throughout his address. He spose thirty
minutes, and at the conclusion he and
Mrs. Bryan were occupied just an honr in
shaking hands with the crowd.
Under the auspices of the Lincoln Bi
metallic Club, the local Traveling Men's
Bryan Club and what wa3 known during
the campaign as the Bryan Home Guards,
William J. Bryan to-nipht delivered his
first formal address since tbe election,
sounding what is generally accepted ad
the keynote ot himself and his followers
in the campaign which is to continue for
the free and unlimited coinage of gold
and silver.
Mr. Bryan was given a flattering recep
tion by the people of his home city. The
meeting was held at the Fuuke Opera
house, which was crowded to the doors.
Mr. Brvan was in Rood voice, and never in
his many speeches before Lincoln audi
ences has he spofcen with greater vigor or
earnestness.
It was iSrvan day in Lincoln, begini. ing
at 3 o'clock this afternoon, when :he
Democratic candidate spoke to ladies only,
and concluding shortly before 11 o'clock,
when he concluded bis effort before a
crowd which was unable to gain admit
tance to the opera-house and waited
patiently for his appearance at Bofaannon
Hall.
Mr. Bryan was loudly cheered when he
made hi 3 nxst appearance this evening.
He spoke deliberately and with emphasis,
saying in part:
Mr. Chairman, Fellow-cititens : I donot know
thai I can make myself beard for any length
oi time. My voice, wnich lias served me well
lor several mouths, during wliicii ii has Deen
severely tried, is worse to-day than it has been
at any time during the campaign.
I am proud of the Rupport of which Nebraska
has given to the cause of bimetallism. I have
looked at the papers some since election. 1
have noticed ratifications and considerable
enthusiam amoug the Republicans, one Re
pub'.ican who has been prominent in the pre
cincts of the capital for many years, who said
he would rather have me elected for Hie than
to have the State go Populist. So that Ne
braska has doae her duty well, aud I am glad
that in this conflict tlie State has been in ninny
respects a pioneer, was not found wanting
when he great test came. And I am proud of
Lancaster County end Lincoln an.i even of my
own ward and precinct. [Laughter].
Some places where I have traveled I fouod
that the question was not who would be elt-ct
ed President, but whether I could carry mv
own ward, and I have heard known nu'nlic
speakers who gave it as a conclusive proof ol
my unpopularity at home that 1 would not be
able to carry my county, my city, my w<ud nor
even the precinct in which I live. They would
never have tune in the heat of the campaign
to explain that this Is ihestrongestÃepubiican
county in this State and the strongest Repub
lican city in the country, and 1 think I live In
the strongest Republican ward in the city
But, of our-e, thtn- is so much to tay that
you hardly expect Republicans to take time to
say everything tbat couid bu said in one
speech, imd, therefore, they always torgoi
to lell about the political complexion of Lan
caster County and Lincoln and tho Fifth
Ward whenever they brag about the vote of
that city, county and ward. But I am very
grateful to my neighbors here for the support
which they have given.
Not only am I grateful to those who have
voted at the polls, but 1 am grateful to those
who before election day gave their tun â¢ hu!
contributed all they could to maKe ihe vote a^
large as possible. [Cheers. J
1 have been proud when I came back :o Lin
coln to meet the Bryan Home Guards and see
the discipline and good appearance which
tlwjy always make when they go out on a
parade. [Renewed cheerinc] And I want to
nay this, that while outside oi this city I think
It is well for the clubs that are going to go on
with th* work of bimetallism thai they drop
my name and taKe a name that is entirely im
personal, :-o that the cause will not be con
aected with any person, because tne cause- is
greater than any person. [Cries of "Never!" 1
We:l. I nay 1 think it Is wise, outside of this
city, for those Bryau clubs to cease to be Bryan
clubs [renewed cries of "Never, never!"l aud
become silver ciubs or bimetallic clubs, so
there would be no jealousy ; so no one could
say tins agitation wa-> in the interest oi any
per.-on, but rather that all might recogniz â  It
as in the lntsrest of a great cause. I say
while 1 be! it ve it is wise, outside of this city
for my name to be dropped, and the clubs to
go on under a more general name, yet In this
city I would be proud to have the Bryan Home
Guards retain their name. [Great cheering.]
Le: me get through with one proposition at a
time. [Laughter.]
I am glad in thiÂ« town to have the veteran
organization which bears my name also retain
that name in order tnat throughout this land
wherever the name of this organlintion may
go, no man can rise and say that the soldiers
of my home city are afraid to trust me.
When in 1890 I was your candidate for Con
greeg I did not talk much about the silver
question My pla;fo:in declared for free sil
ver, but my opponent was for free silver also
and therefore there was no contest. [Laugh
ter.] On that subject we agreed, but that is
the last time I have ever been able to get a
Republican ie agree witn me; that is the lasi
Republican candidate against whom 1 have
run who has agreed with me on tho monty
question.
Well, now, I want to say a word for the fu
ture. We have passed through this campaign
and we have been deteated, and I want you to
re..iember this, ihat ihere is not iv this land a
single advocate of free coinage who is not will
ing to abide the decision of the people with
out complaint. [Cheers] You do not find
among the silver men those who say. as a dis-
UnÃUished Republican in New York said we
mny not abide by the result.
You do not find among the silver men per
sons who will stnnd up and express doubt as
to whether the will of tho American people is
supreme. Those people wno say that you find
among the creat corporate interests of this
country, which are entrenched behind the
Retublican party and who threaten not to
i abide by ihe deciaioi of ihe eleciion unlesa
they could continue to represent the Amer
! lean people.' * Among the men > who called us
anarchists you find the ones: who hiniedat
possible means by which the will of the people
could be defeated.- I urn > proud ,that in our
ranks we had men who loved this form of gov
ernment, that no matter what the.people say!
wiey rule, and we bow to thelrisuprtmacy.-
f a 'Â«' m v friends, bowing to a": decision, accept
ing without compialnt the result of an elec
tion does not mean that; we shall surrender
our convictions or that in the future we shall
t ' v. wlt n ess earnestness than we have
fought in the past. You must remember that
in me history of this Nation some; party has
always been defeatea, and yet parties have
not gone out of existence because of defeat.
.. ember thai the Democratic party has
lived lor many years without ever having won
a 1 residential election,- and it lived after it
Wo * Pres idential election and then failed to
get the President electedâ because it is the
opinion of the Democrats of . this Nation that
Samuel J. Tilde n was elected Presiaont, and
yet the people who supported him were will
ing to abide by a decision of a" tribunal * insti
tuted for the purpose of settling that dispute
i say the Democratic party has lived through
defeat; the Republican party has lived through
?? f c . f Â£ at ; all parties have lived through defeat,
ii they had anything to live for, and when our
opponents tell us that this defeat means the
annihilation o: those who believe in free sil
ver, they take counsel of their hopes instead
of their judgment. [Great . cheering.] I be
neve that we have made great progress in this
campaign. We have not made the progress
which we hoped to have made.
we nave not achieved the results which we
expected to achieve, but, my friends, the
cbuso of bimetallism was stronger the day
after election than it was at any day during
the campaign. I want to tay thisâ and your
observation will bear out my remarksâ that
we went into this fight a disorganized army;
we came out of it a lighting lorce that has
never had a superior in history. [Applause.]
Now we have passed the stage of argument
When you discuss public questions you pre
sent your arguments to the people. They ask
you why you believe in bimetallism or in the
gold standard. You tell them. You explain
to taem. You tell them: what -you believe
each policy will do. They say that is prophecy,
iney may refuse to believe you, but when the
time comes, for action then the successful
party must put its policy into operation, and
when those policies are in operation then you
can judge the effect which they produce.
If the Republican party can make this coun
try prosperous under the gold standard it will
nave to reverse : the laws of nature and give
points to all the writers on political economy.
[Applause.] .If the Republican party can
bring prosperity to this country by making
money dearer, it will do what never has been
done by any other party in any other country.
But, my friends, see the arguments that expe
rience has to disprove. The Republicans went
before the laboring men and told them that
low prices were great blessings because their
wages would go farther, and they went before
the farmer and told the farmer that agricul
ture was depressedâ and that .'â¢imply means
prices were downâ and that the gold standard
Â«nd â especially confidence [ap
plause and laughter] would restore prosperity
and restore prices to. the farmer.
Now, I want to suggest to those who are
going to continue -the organization of these
Clubs that they meet at stated . times, say once
a month or at such times as the members of
the club may decide, and that at these meet
ings they discuss public questions, i believe
that the public servant ought to live continu
ally under the eye of the master whom be
serves. 1 believe that the people, when they
elect a man to office, should watch bis ' every
act and disc his every vote. and speech in
order that they may know whether he is a
man to be employed in that business or not.
[Applause.] And, therefore, I say to you that
these clubs can find ample employment of
their time if they will discuss irom month to
month, from meeting to meeting, the uarioug
questions which arise and interest the Ameri
can people. You tell me tnis is agitation. .. I
say to you that when you go into a nation
where there is no agitation of Dublic ques
tions among the people you-. will find a
nation where a few can prey undisturbed
upon all the rest of the people. [Applause.]
Thomas Jefferson Â»aiii a great truth when he
said that' iree government exists in jealousy ;
and not In confidence, and that confidence is
everywhere the parent of ue*potism." He was
right. Confidence is the parent of .despotism
and exists among the people." It is the oppor
tunity sought by th â  enemies of the peeple,
and agitation among the people of every pub
lic question gives as more lulelligeut citizen
ship, and more intelligent citizenship gives us
better government .[Cheers.)
. I understand from the papers that the chair
man of the Republican National Committee
has suggested that they will also keep up their
organization. I am glad of it. 1 have never
advised those who believed with me to do a
single thing that I would not advise my oppo
nents to do, and when I advised our people to
keep organized and to keep discussing, 1 ad
vise our opponents to do the same thing, be
cause if tuÂ«p would discuss more ana think
more i&ere Jrbiyd be less of them:
Now, 1 would like to see all' the" silver clubs
in the country maintain their, organizations,
have regular meetings, discuss these questions,
and I wuuid : like to see all the Republican
organizations keep up and. their .meetings
keep up, and then I' would lite to sea joint
debates between our orgnnizations and theirs,
because, my friends, if they can convince our
people that we are wrong we have no claim
upon our people, and If we can convince them
that we are right, then I think we will not
only have a claim, but will successfully assert
it. [Applause.]

ance of the National Democratic â  party's

tended by most of the members of the
State Central Committee, those who were
candidates on the State ticket and half a
hundred other prominent gold Democrat*,
r"presentinÂ£ a score of cities throughout
this State. The* decision took the form of
an address to the ; Democrats of Illinois
declaring that the National Democratic
party is the only- Democratic party and
that its , permanence was therefore fixed
ami obligatory. â¢ '
J The address states that the party's
transient antagonist is the free - silver
party, but its permanent antagonist is the
Republican party, and concludes by claim
ing that a conservative estimate of the
Illinois election returns shows over 100,000
Democrats voted against free silver.
Permanent State headquarters will be
kept here, and the party intends to take
an active part in the municipal election of
Chicago, in the hope of crcstiincrthe Dem
ocratic machine dominated ,by Governor
Aligeld, especially ;if the Governor is
nominated for Mayor. D. A. Goodrich of
Chicago was elected chairman of the State
Committee to succeed the late Charles A.

HERBERT TO BE PROVIDED FOR.
President Cleveland Wilt Appoint the Naval
Secretary Chief Justice of the
Court of Claims.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 14.-A special
from Washington says: One of the family
secrets of tne Cleveland household is that
Secretary of tne Navy Herbert is to be
nominated as Chief Justice of the Court
of Claims to succeed Justice Richardson,
deceased. The name of ei-Congfessmarl
Bynuni has been conspicuously mentioned
for that office, but Secretary Herbert de
sires that appointment, and it is the opin
ion of those who ougbt to know tho Presi
dent's mind that the Secretary of the
Navy will be nominated. Mr. Herbert
was an original gold Democrat In Con
gress before he was called inco the Cleve
land Cabinet the Alabama statesman was
opposed to free coinage. Men of his mone
tary predilections are not popular with
Alabama Democrats now, and the Secre
tary of the Navy Has no desire to return
there. Cleveland is anxious to relieve hia
Cabinet Minister of embarrassment.

Kever Has There BeeD
Such a Great Display
of Horses.

Been the Success That
Was Anticipated.
BEAUTIES THAT WON PRIZES.
Graceful Antics That Receive the
Plaudits of the Representatives

NEW. YORK, N. ; V., Nov. 14.âAmer
ica's greatest horse show .closed to-night,
alter a. most successful week. > The total
attendance has been close to 70,000. So- !
ciety has been on hand as usual, but the
mass of visitors have been' true lovers of
the horse, in his many varied types,
shown here as never before on this side of
the Atlantic vt'V.j*-^' '
The management has the satisfaction of
knowing that arrangements have been so
perfect for handling the crowds of people
and for caring the horses that no accident
to man or beast has marred the occasion.
Horsemen and horsewomen from other
cities, as well as from this locality, have
nothing but praise for the show and its
exhibits. The judging has been most
fair. In no class has favoritism been
shown, and those who nave failed to win
first prizes admit fair defeat.
Yesterday the greatest crowd of the
week was present. The raid admissions
numbered over 15.000. This * afternoon
C 750 people were present To-night, when
the greatest crowd of the week was ex
pected, the jam was no greater than last
night. The box and the arena seats were
filled and the promenade was a surging
mass of humanity.

crowd.

AS TO DETECTIVE "JONES."
Irish Leaders Not at all Afraid That the
Spy of the British Government
Can Betray Them.
NEW YORK, j\\ V.; Nov. 14.-The story
of Spy Williams, alias Thomas Merrick
Jones, who testified in London yesterday
against Edward J. Ivory, giving par
ticulars of the Irish secret orders, was the
subject of much discussion this morning
among Irishmen prominent in the national
movement.
William Lyman, president of the Irish
National Alliance, said that while here
Jones seemed very fiery aeainst England
and was always talking of using dyna
mite. He may have been a member of
the Shamrock Club, but that is not a
secret organization. It is not even a
political organization. "1 know, also,
that Ivory's trip had no mission, political
or private," said Lyman. "The charge
against him is trumped up and the testi
mony is manufactured."
Mr. Lym.ui emphatically denied that
Jones was a delegate to the convention
held in Chicago at which the Irish Na
tional Alliance was organized. He de
clared that England employing spies was
only acting now us she had always done.
He became very grave as he proceeded,
and said: ; 'I have col positive informa
tion that within the last three months
England has sent spies to sketch cv. j ry
lort in this country, an i that she has been
laying short cables alone the iakes con
nectii% this country with Canada. These
cables are laid in such a position that they
can be picked op and utilized at a mo
ment's notice.
"I can tell exactly where these cables
have been laid, and have got a map of the
locality which I can produce at any
time."
Messrs. Balfe, GalUghcr, Kearny,
Tynan and otner Irishmen prominent in
Irish societies approached by reporters
of the United Associated Presses all
agree tnat there is nothing for Jones to
tall that would be the slightest use to
Scotland Yard. At the same time they
believe that it will materially operate
againut Ivory in the fort coinins trial.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 14. â William
Pinkerton, speaking of Informet "Jones,"
whose testimony in the Ivory case in Lon
don yesterday caubed a sensaiion, said to
a reporter this morning:
"Tne British Government always has
secret service men in its employ in this
country endeavoring to unravel any plots
which might arise. In connection with
the arrest of Tynan recently for some rea
son it was stated that these arrests were
made through our agency. I was not here
at the time, but denied the matter in the
San Francisco papers. I wunt to deny
here that we ever assisted the British Gov
ernment.
"In a few cases we have been called upon
to assist Scotland Yard in a civil case,
but have never taken part in a criminal
case. During the Parnell suit against the
London Times the British sent a repre
sentative here to retain our services in
that suit, but my brother and I both de
clined the employment. The man who
approached me was an ex-detective, and
I tod him at the time that 1 did not think
he would make a success at his business,
and that the way he was rtoing be was
going to get himself hurt it he did not
look out.
"He went to New York from here,
where he framed up a combination with
some people, who got all bis money and
sold him boeus information. That is the
last 1 know of any English detective look
ing for any information of that kind in
this country. But this man did not have
the recognition ot Scotland Yard.
"There is no doubt that the British Gov
ernment is continually aler.t lor plots in
this country, but the work is all done by
British secret service men."
MANGLED BY DYNAMITE.
Three Men Killed by a Terrific
Explosion at Niagara
Falls
Windows Broken by F ying Wreck
age in Buildings a Long Dis
tance Away.
NIAGARA FALLS, N. V. f Nov. U.-A
violent explosion this morning startled
the people of this city and resulted in the
death of two men, the fatal injury of a
third and the serious injury of three
others.
Tne explosion took plac6 in the build
ing occupied by El Smith & C>Â con
tractors, who have been doing some ex
cavatine work near by. The building was
completely destroyed, and so violent was
the concussion that windows were broken
by the flying wreckage in buildings a long
distance away So complete was the
wreck that for a considerable time it was
impossible to ascertain how much loss of
life ha.i occuired.
The workmen had been preparing for a
blast, and finding their dynamite frozen
had thawed out about thirty pounds of
tte explosive. Albert Reynold*, a work
men, had attended to this part of the work
and had then carried the dynamite into
the house to prepare for the blast.
Just how the explosion occurred is not
known, as Reynolds and tbe general man
ager, a Dane named Hakken Hammer,
who were working with the dynamite,
were instantly killed, their bodies being
fjightfu ly mangled:
John R. Pitkett, foreman of the stone
cuuers, received injuries that will prove,
fatal. John Robbins and George Mill?,
workmen, were so badly hurt about the
head that it is thought both will lose their
eyesight.
M. E. MISSIONERS MORE

Germany.
DETROIT, Mich., Nov. 14.â The general
missionary committee of the If. E. church

worK of Bishop Thoburn in India.
A plan is on foot to amalgamate the
Wesleyan Methodist missions in South

Sues the l*re*Â» for Libel.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 14.â CharleÂ»
A. Hess, the late candidate for Congress
in the Twelfth District, who was defeated
for that, office by George B. McCiellan,
has brought action for libel against the
New York Press, claiming $50,000 dam
ages. The alleged libel arises out of the
charges made by the Press against' Mr.
Hess that he paid $6000 to Asa Thornton
and otners for the purpose of procuring
his (Hess 1 ) nomination and to use in the
district xo purchase votes for i im on elec
tion day. The Press declared, the com
plaint alleges, that Hess was a non-resi
dent in the district, and it is alleged made
other charges which are made the grounds
for the suit.
Spain's Latent JBlunder.
MADRID, Spain, Nov. H.â A dispatch
from Havana to the Imparcial says: The
arrival of Cuban exiles in Spain has had a
bad effect here. The Spanish authorities

island of Fernando instead of their being
taken to Spain for confinement.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL^ SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1596.
GREAT DISTRESS
BUT NO FAMINE
General Failure of Crops
Met With Measures
of Relief.
Tenantr, However, Will Not Be
Prompt in the Payment
of Rents.
CONCERT OF EUROPEAN POWERS
English Diplomats Believe That Pres
sure Will Be Brought to B?ar
on Turkey's Sultan.
LONDON, Eng., Nov. 14.â Endeavoring
to obtain lrom ofhc al sources further in
formation regarding the impending
famine in Ireland, a representative of the
United Associated Presses learned that al
though the local Irish -authorities re
ported on the tailure of the crops in many
districts, the official view was that no seri
ous, widespread famine was anticipated.
There can now be no really extensive
famine in Ireland, the arrangements fot
relief having been so perfected that the
central authorities in Dublin can assist
the local authorities at almost a moment's
notice.
Into the question of suspension of rent
payments by the farmers the oiliciais in
terv.ewed declined to go. From other
sources it can be affirmed that the Dublin
Cas.le authorities have been warned of
the wholesale refusal of the smaller farm
ers to pay their rents on the simple ground
of inability. There has been up till now a
remarkable absence of agrarian crime in
Ireland.
Notwithstanding the fact that the Sultan
has promised to execute sweeping reforms
throughout his dominions, his promises
are still looked at askance by those who
have had experience in dealing with his
artfulness. In spite of the fact that orders
have already been given for the putting
into effect of some of the reform? promised,
it is not believed that tney will prove
effective.
The jubilation among the newspapers
over the restoration of the concert of the
powers, which, it is claimed here, is re
sponsible for the pressure brought to -bear
upon the Sultan, which compelled him to
grant the reforms, may be shortlived.
Cynical observers of the situation do not
place much faith in the claims that Great
Britain had a prominent pait in tne con
cert. They maintain that Russia, acting
through Francs, is the country that de
serves the credit for forcing the Sultan to
understand that be must mend his ways
and do something besides making promises
that he never intends to fulfill.
If this is really tLe case there is little
room to doubt that there will be a radical
change in the Turkish policy, for Russia
is really the only power of which the Sul
tan stands in fear. Great Britain may
blow and bluster, but the ruler of Turkey
well knows that she is utterly impotent to
do anything more than to make threats,
'and she is not threatening now as much as
she did a year ago.
With Russia it is a different matter. Of
course it hurts British pride to know that
Russia, acting through France, has been
able to accomplish more with the Sultan
than she, Turkey's self-constituted pro
tector, and it may be that it is this feeling
of injury that leads official circles here to
believe that what England could not ac
complish would also be impossible for
France. But the fact remains that it was
to M. Hanotaux, the French Foreign Min
ister, that the Sultan first promised the
granting of reforms mo'e sweeping In
their nature than those promised to Great
Britain months ago, not one of which was
ever put into effect, and that already some
of these last promised reforms are now
being carried out.
The Cabinet councils, arranging the
Government legislation for the coming
session, have decided upon opening busi
ness with the education bill, followed by
a military works bill and an elaborate
measure dealing with the appointment of
a masters' and workmen's conciliation
board. The military works measure was
prepared for last year, but was postpone 1
owing to the exigencies of the parliamen
tary situation. The great military har
bors in Britain are to have their arma
ments increased, and the forts at Malta,
Gibraltar, Hongkong, Singapore and other
stations are to be enlarged and strength
ened. Conjoined with this military works
bill is a scheme for aiding colonial gov
ernments in the protection of their har
bors.
The Devonshire Club eives an honorary
banquet to Chamberlain about the middle
of December. The Devonshire Club, since
the split between the Home-rulera and
Unionists in the National Liberal Club, has
been the rallying-place of the Liberal
Unionists. Under the fostering care of
Chamberlain the Liberal Unionists domi
nate the management of the club, and
Austen Chamberlain^s an active member
of the committee. The club has a solid
basis, but cannot be said to prosper. The
Liberal clubs are waning in membership,
while Conservative clubs boom.
The Conservative managers of the Con
stitutional Club have ventured upon a
scheme grander than anything in clubs
the world has yet seen. They are inviting
by private circular subscriptions for the
erection of a buildiug which is to be
adapted to the uses of 15,000 members.
This club is to be the focus of all Conser
vative movements and is to have a ball
room admitting of the largest gatherings
of the party, a theater for lectures or dra
matic performances, cheap membership
admission and a cheap Cuisine. The Carl
ton, Junior Carlton, Conservative, Junior
Conservative and kindred groups will sub
scribe and patronize, but personally their
members hold aloof.
The supplying of water for London from
Wales is an old scheme. It is calculated
that between the amount required for the
purchase of the water companies now
holding the monopoly of the supply and
the cost of the works from Wales, the cost
would be over Â£100,000,000. This enor
mous sum could, of course, be raised by
successive loans, but it would make tne
Londoners pay for a long time more than
is now exacted from them by the water
companies. Birmingham and other great
centers are competitors wi;h London for
the water-bearing area in Wales.
The appeal against the decision of the
mixed tribunal at Cairo, forbidding the
Anglo-Egyptian government from draw
ing on the Cui&se of the public debt for
the expenses of t:ie Dongola expedition is
to be heard on the 17th of November. Tbe
Foreign Office officials in London have
reason to believe that the resistance of the
French government to the appeal will be
relaxed ami that the decision will be in
favor of the Caisse.
The possible appointment of the Hon.
Chauncey M. Depew to succeed Mr.
Bayard as American Embastador to Great
Britain is hailed here with much satisfac
tion. It is said that Depew, while speak
ing recently with an English politician,
admitted hi 3 willingness to accept the
post if it were offered to him. Depew
would certainly be a persona grata in the
highest circles, and he is universally
popular.
fcur R chard Webster, Attorney-General,
is supposed to be disqualified for member
ship in the Venezuelan arbitration court,
as he is committed to an opinion through
his advocacy of the British case. Sir Ed
ward Clarke, ex-Solicitor-General, and
Secretary Frederick Pollock, corpus pro
fessor of jurisprudence of Oxford Univer
sity, are also disqualified, the former
through his opposition to the British
claims and the latter by his support of
them.
It is surmised that Lord Salisbury will
seiect Lord Herschel, formerly Lord High
Chancellor and now a meml^r of the Ju
dicial Committee of the Privy Council,
and Lord Davey, a Lord of Appeal in Or
dinary and also a member of the Judicial
Committee of the Privy Council. It may
be, however, that Professor Thomas Ers
kiue Holland, Chichele professor of inter
national law at Oxford University, will be
selected as one of the British judges.
Sir Edward Clarke received a retainer of

INGERSOLL STAYS AWAY.
Refuses to Attend the Congress
of the American SecularÂ©-**
Union.
Very Plain Talk R garding tbe Move
ment to Insert the Name of the
D.ity in the Constitution.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 14.â Colonel Rob
ert G. Inuersoll is not in attendance upon
the congress ot the American Secular
Union and Free Thought Federation,
which held its second session here to-day.
The famous agnostic was to have addressed
the congress to-morrow, bul the date was
canceled some weeks ago. The reason for
this is said to be political intolerance.
Colonel Inger-'oll, as is well known, has
been a strong advocate of gold for the past
few months, while the majority of his
brethren of the Free Thought Federation
are strong silver adherents. Many sharp
letters were written the Colonel Dy these
partisans, and at last they provoked a re
sponse in a declination to speak before the
congress on the ground that the Colonel
believed he would not be welcome.
"It is a pity some people can't iet others
hold such opinions as they see tit," de
clared President Samuel P. Putnam to
day. "I am sorry that some of our own
people are so bigoted about these things.
I sincerely hope Colonel Inger^oli will not
continue to feel hurt, and will soon be
back in the fold."
At the morning session of the congress
Arthur E. Gammage of Chicago vigorously
denounced the movement to insert tne
name of the deity in tne constitution of
the United State.
"If tne names of God, Christ and the
Bible are put in tbe constitution," he de
clared. "I shall be in favor of a monarchy,
with Taimaee as king; I shall advocate
the restoration of tne inquisition, with
Satolli as chief inquisitor. I think that
would be the only way to make the people
rise up as they should."
F. C. Walker of New York made a bitter
attack upon the Young People's Society
ot Christian Endeavor and the Epworth
League.
The following officers were re-elected:
President, Samuel P. Putnam of Chicago;
vice-presidents â Hon. C. B. Waite of Chi
cago, T. B. Wakeman of New YorK, John
E. Remsberg of Atchison, Kans., and
Franklin Steiner of i)es Moines; corre
sponding secretary, E. C. Reichwald ot
Ciiicago; treasurer, Otto Weilstein of
Rochelle, 111.
Tbe speakers at the afternoon session
were Mrs. Mattie Krekel of Kansas,
Franklin Steiner of Dcs Moines, lowa, and
Charles Walts of Lnndon, Eng.
A SHORTAGE OF SAILORS.
Warships in Commission Must Remain
Idle Owing to a Considerable Scarcity
of Seamen and Marines.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Nov. 14.â War talk
was still rife in the navy-yard yesterday
afternoon among the officers and men.
Their chief apprehension was that there
would be a scarcity of meu to man the
ships. The last Congress added 1000 en
listed men to the naval forces, raising the
number t0.J.1,000. These extra men have
been placed in the new ships in commis
sion, and the ships that are now ready
are without recruits.
This state of things has kept the big
monitor Puritan out of commission since
the beginning of the month. The officers
practically have been decided upon, but
there are no men for the crew. Neither
are there any men in sight for the
cruiser Brooklyn, which will be ready for
active service next month. Although the
rani Katahdin is officially in commission
there are no men for her. The new gun
boat Helena will soon be ready too, and
there will be the same lack of men for
her.
Recruiting only to fill vacancies is going
on on board the receiving sh p Vermont.
The department will ask Congress for
2000 men, but in the meantime some of
the big warships will have to lie at the
docks.
RECEIVED THE PRIMATE
Ceremonious JUit of Cardinal Gibbons
to a trench Flitrj.ititp.
BALTIMORE, Md.. Nov. 14.â Cardinal
Gibbons was received with high honors
on the French flagship Dubourdieu, lying
in the harbor off Fort McHenry here, yes
terday. Admiral Maisonneuve sent his
own launch to convey the American pri
mate to the ship. The launch was dec
orated with the tri-color and the stars and
stripes. The Cardinal was accooipaniel
by the Rev. Dr. Alpbonse Mapnien, Presi
dent of St. Mary's Seminary, a ;ioted
French scholar.
As the party stepped upon the deck o
the war vessel the band played and the
sailors and marines, who had been drawn
up in line, doffed their bats. The ad
miral and the officers of th ship in full
ares? uniform saluted the Cardinal.
Ihrf admiral and the ship's chaplain
then escorted the visitors on a trip of in
spection over the ship, after which they
were entertained at lunch in the admiral's
cabin. The ship's chaplain celebrates
mass daily at an altar on the main deck.
SHARP DEBATES
ARE THE ORDER
Interpellation of the Radi
cals May Cause a
' Storm.
Bismarck's Tactics and the
Brutal Treatment of Civil
ians by Army Officers.
THESE WILL BE INVESTIGATED
On the Whole (he Coming Session of
the Reichstag Will Result in
Many Reforms.
BERLIN, Germany, Nov. 14.â The in
terpellation which is to be introduced by
the Radicals in the Reichstag on the
murder of Herr Sieberman by Lieutenant
yon Brusewitz at Carlsrube and other
military outrages and scandals ha 3 been
set down upon the order of the day for
Mond:iy, and will be submitted after the
interpellation of the Centrist party upon
the revelations made by Prince Bismarck
through the medium of the Hamburger
Nachrichten, and it is probable the whole
of the week will be occupied by fierce de
bates on both motions.
The Centrist motion is so phrased as to
endeavor to induce the Government to
disclose the nature of the treaty existing
between Germany and Russia prior to
1890 and to explain why it was permitted
to lapse. As Prince Hohenlobe, the Im
perial Chancellor, left Berlin on Monday
last, to be gone several days, it was under
stood that he had arranged with Freiherr
Marscnall yon Biebers.ein, Minister of
Foreign Affairs, to answer the interpella
tion in relation to the Russo-German
treaty; but to-day it is stated that Prince
Hohenlohe him3elf will read the Govern
ment declaration. Prince Hohenlohe Las
been hunting with the Emperor and the
Grand Duke Vladimir of Russia at Letz
dingen, and it was reported that he was
going from there to Strasburg.
However, whether Prince Hohenlohe or
Baron yon Bieberstein replies to the Cen
trist motion, nobody expects that an ex
plicit statement will be made in regard to
the Russo-German treaty or any other
treaties other than the Russo-German neu
trality convention ol 1884. It is expected
that the reply of the Government will
be substantially a denunciation of the
publication of the disclosures, neither
affirming nor denying Prince Bismarck's
revelations, accompanied by a protest
against the newspaper discussions of the
old Chancellor's indiscretions, which the
whole country ought to regret.
Although the debate on the Centrist
motion in regard to the treaty will be
of great importance perhaps still greater
interest attaches to the debate on the
military reform measures which will
arise from the Radical interpellation.
The mystery connected with Lieutenant
yon Brusewitz's sentence of lour years'
confinement in a fortress ana dismissal
from the army, the subsequent deuialthat
ne had been condemned, the report that
his colonel set him at liberty and only
caused his rearrest upon the orders of his
(tne colonel's) superiors and the other
stories of abuse of soldiers by officers re
quire explanation, and the Radicals mean
to have it if possible.
In an article on the subject the Tage
blatt says that the Emperor, after speak
ing to tne recruits on the occasion of their
beinc sworn in on Thursday, addressed
the officers seriously in regard to the al
leged military outrages upon civilians, but
purposely spoke in so low a tone that his
remarks were only audible to those imme
diately surrounding him. The Vorwaerts,
the organ oi the Socialists, draws the
worst augury of the Government's defense
from the report that the Emperor in his
address to the recruits said, "Whoever at
tacks my uniform insults me."
Whatever may be the issue of the de- \
bate, however, it will clear the atmos
phere around the subject and pive an im
petus to the military judicial reforms.

citizens returning to Germany for any
length ot time shall be subject to an
especially strict surveillance and sranted
only a limited period oi sojourn in the

expelled from the country. Any persons
discovered who shall continue their resi

drafted into the army, despite their
naturalization, and required to serve a
regulation term in the military service if
such persons have not passed the age of
31 years. If they are more than 31 years
of ace they, may be expelled. Sons of
naturalized Germans born in America and
coining to Germany for the purpose of
permanent residence will be recognized as

POINTS OF LAW
JSeto Tork Court of ppnati' Decision on
â  a Charitable litqtirst.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 14â The
Judges ot the appellate division of the
Supreme Court handed down a decision
yesterday that is important, regarding
charitable bequests. The decision was
given in the case of Margaret B. Edson,
executrix of the will of Marmount B.
Edson, against J. E. Parsons, Charles 8.
Fairchild, J. A. Barlow and Mr. Hunting
ton.
Several important points regarding the
law which makes charitable bequests void
if the codicil or will is made within two
mouths of the time of the deatn of tne
testator are touched upon.
Mary A. Edson died in May, 1890. She
left an eatate of $1,000,000. Her brother
Marniount B. Edson, was her heir, but tie
died two years later. His heirs are his
son Jiraes B. Edson and his daughter
Mary G., who is married to J. B. H. Al
dnch. In her will Miss Edson made sev
eral bequests in codicils written within a
month oi her deatu. The plaintiff in the
present action sued to recover the money
so distributed. Judge Russell dismissed
the complaint on iin merits. The appel
late division yesterday affirmed the judg
ment.
WHERE IS GENERAL WEYLER?
Probabilities Are That the Captain Butcher
h Waiting for a Chance to Fake
a Report of Victory.
HAVANA, Cuba, Nov. 14.â As the days
pass and bring no news from the Spanish
forces in the province of Pinar del Rio the
anxiety grows deeper and many rumors
are circulated.
The sitnation of General Weyler is un
known, and the non-receipt of intelligence'
concerning his movements leads many
persons here to believe that he is waiting
for a decisive engagement with the rebels
before he will allow any information to
leak out
It is reported that the rebel chief Du
cassi was killed in the engagement with
General Weyler's forces in the Rubi hilis.
Coionel Lara reports having an engage
ment witii a party of rebels near Calaua
zar, province of Santa Clara. He says the
insurgents were routed with a loss of
twenty-one killed. The troops lost three
killed and eight wounded.
Serafin Sanchez, the rebel leader, at
tacked the town of Condado, twelve mile 3
from Trinidad.
The insurgents fired eight cannon shots,
but did no damage. Finding it impos
sible to capture the town, the rebels set
fire to a number of houses in the outskirts
and cut the telegraph wires, after which
they retired.
James Brown, a British subject, has
been expelled from the island for talking
against Spain in the streets of Havana.
KEY WEST, Fla., Nov. 14.â Passengers
by the steamer Olivette to-night report
Weyier at the trocha with 35.000 men, and
that he will now try to surround Maceo.
Spanish troops under Generals Munoz
and Echague made an attack on the in
surgents near Loma Rubi. The insurgents
had set dynamite in front of their en
trenchments and waited the attack.
When the Spanish approached the in
surgents exploded their dynamite, caus
ing great loss of life. Munoz ia reported
killed and one of Echague's legs was
blown off. It is reported in Havana that
General Castellano has been made a pris
oner by General Gomez near Puerto
Principe.
SAVED BY THE OFFICERS
Vigorous Action Prevents a Mob
From Lynching Three
Negro Prisoners.
Desperadoes Whose Murderous Deeds
Arouse the Ire of Kentucky
Citizsns
HENDERSON, Ky., Nov. 14â Prompt
and vigorous action of the authorities
saved three negroes from being lynched
here this afternoon. Dave Powell, Will
Dixon and Will Lower were arrested be
fore daylight this morning on a charge of
having entered the store of Land & Metz
ner last night, holding up Louis Metzner
and fatally shooting him.
The leader of the robbers did all the
shooting. Tney were masked and when
tbe prisoners were taken from bed pistols
were found under tneir pillows. Four'
chambers of Powell's gun were empty.
Tbe citizens were excited and threatened
lynching, especially as there are four ne
groes in jail who participated in the mur
der of Officer White at Owensboro.
A big crowd surrounded the jail and
courthouse, openly threatening to take
the prisoners from the officers as soon as
an attempt was made to remove them to a
safer place. The absence of a leader only
prevented an attack on the jail.
A strong escort of officers, under direc
tion of the Sheriff, took the prisoners from
the jail to the railroad depot. The mob,"
beaded by John Born, attempted to take
the negroes from the officers, but Jailer
Kohl knocked the leader down with a rifle
and the prisoners were landed on a Louis
viile and Nashville train without further
resistance.

CONSTANTINOPLE.Tuekey, Nov. 14.â
The Sultan gave an audience to Signor
Panza, the Italian Embassador, who in
sisted that the proposed reforms should
be executed immediately. The Sultan
promised that they should be enforced,
but Sijjnor Panza said they were not being
enforced. It was not enough, he declared,
that the reforms should be published, they
sdould be actually carried out. SSipnor
Panza also insisted that Mazeban Bey,
who is held to be responsible for tne mur
der of the Italian priest, Father Salvator,
should be summarily punished.

NOT ALL CARELESS
Some Employers Are Very
Kind to Their Em
ployes.
ONE INSTANCE IN POINT.
A Bookkeeper Who Is Given a
Holiday, Medical Aid and
Other Things. .
It is an old saying that "Corporations
have no soul," and by dint of repetition
and application it has come to be applied
to almost every employer of labor. But
that this is unfair is easy of demonstra
tion. Indeed, an Instance has just come
to light which shows a well-known mer
chant of this City in a most enviable
light. The facts as related by the man
who was treated by this gentleman in a
big-hearted way are as follows: Mr.
Jones (we will call him that, for, for ob
vious reasons, he does not wish his name
to be known) had been out of work for a
very long time, and the worry was begin
ning to tell on him. At nights he could
not sleep his appetite forsook him, and ha
was generally miserable. Hope of obtain
ing employment had just about gone
when one day in reply to an application
that he had made for a position which he
had seen advertised as vacant he was
asked to call on the head of a well-known
firm. He knew that this was a most im
portant thing, and yet was so "weak and
weary," as he put it, that he found it
necessary to take some stimulant before
Keeping his appointment with his would
be employer. On the advice of a physi
cian he took a couple of strychnine pills
and then "made the brace," as he calls it.
He was employed and at once entered
on his duties. He had been at work about
a week when the senior member of the
firm noticed one morning that his hands
trembled visibly, and a few moments later
he was summoned to the private office.
"Mr. Jones," said the head of the con
cern, "do you drink?"
"A little.ciaret with my meals â nothing
else," was the reply.
"Then you are ill," said the merchant
gravely. j,
"Only a little nervousness, nothing to
prevent my going on with my work, sir,"
said tne now anxious Jones.
"Come and Bee me just before you go to
lunch," said the merchant kindly enough,
bat it gave Jones the shivers thinking he
might lose his newly found job. However
when he came in at the noon hour, he was
handed a note to the Chief Consulting
Physician of the Hudson Medical Insti
tute and asked to go to the big white build
ing at the junction of Market, Stockton
and Ellis streets, and deliver it in person.
This he did. After reading the note, the
doctor said "Mr. S has not misjudged
the matter at all. I see yon are altogether
run down. But we will soon put you
all right." A careful examination of the
case was made, and Mr. Joaes â after con
fessing to one or two follies to which most
men are prone, protested tnat be could
not afford to pay for treatment. "Don't
bother about that" said the man with the
grave face who had just completed tbe ex
amination. "You can see the manager."
Going into the manager's room he was
shown a note which read something like
this:
Hudson Medical Instituteâ Gentlemen: Will
you please examine and prescribe as you may
see fit for our Mr. Jones and send us your bill
for same. He has been with us but a very few
days, but we think him a valuable man. If he
needs rest tell him to take it, and that he can
come back to his post as soon es he is well.
Yours truly, , S S & CO.
Mr. Jones says that he took nothing but
the "Great Hudyan," that marvelous
remedio-treatment which the famous
doctors of the great Hudson Medical In
stitute discovered, and that he was back
at work quite well and a thoroughly new
man in thirty days. He acknowledges
that but for the marked kindness of his
employer he would have had to give
up his position, but still he cannot say
too much in praise of that wonderful
vegetable remedy, Hudyan, with which
he was so quickly put on his feet again.
Any one wishing testimonials about the
great Hudyan can obtain them by writing
to the Hudson Medical Institute at 5
Stockton street.

PORTLAND, Ore., Nov. 14.â George
Dixon, a well-known timber land a^ent
iroai the Sound, met with an adventure
last evening that will be indelibly im
pressed uiion his mind until memories are
buried in the grave. He was sitting in
an olhce it: the Raleigh building on Sixtli
an.! Washington streets, with the door
ajar, waiting for a friend, when a fim
.ooking, well-dressed and stalwart stranger
ruslied in upon him, yelling at the top of
. his voice:
"I demand instantaneous relict from
â¢ you."
Before Mr. Dixon could reply or formu
late an idea as to what the stranger
wanted, the latter clutched him by the
â  h oat, dragged him from a chair to the
floor und began strangling him. The !
stranger's strong lingers had closed so
tiuhtly about Dixon'.- neck that he could
do nothing but make aslig:t gurgling
noise, and he was almost on the brink of
unconsciousness, when another stranger
hurriedly entered the office, dastnd to the
rescue and disengaged the strangler from
hi-i victim.
Pardon me a moment, sir," said the
newcomer, handing to Dixon a card on
which was inscribed: "F. R. Josaelyn,
M. D , Chicago, 111. 1 ' "I intuitively un
derstand that it is your purpose to sum
m >n an officer, but please refrain until I
.<an offer an explanation and whatever j
reasonable reparation you may demand." I
lÂ»r. Josselyn remarked that the young j
man was a charge of his nameti Frunk
Sterling, the adopted son and heir of a
. millionaire Rhode Island print manufac
turer, and that he was young Sterling's
u:.oie. They arrived here three days ago
from the K:ist, stopping at a private board
ing-house on Thirteenth street pending
heir departure for the Orient, where it
. was hojed Sterling would find relief ioim
. mental aberration. Hi- failing had here
tofore id an iff .â¢'ted it&eif oniy by throwing
him inio paroxysms of vioientrage, which
nquired heroic treatment, but never be
fore was he guilty of such an act as that of
' . las: night.
'But." said Dr. Josselyn to Mr. Dixon,
"I presume all this does not interest, you
after the experience you had with 'my
'nephew. A few moments before he dis
turbed you he and I came out of the Ore
gonian building, and he requested me to
. |x-rm*t him to visit a drugstore on the
next corner, as he wanted some toilet
articles. I granted the request and then
foliuw<-d clo>ely in his rear. I saw him
. ascending the stairs in this building, so
Â» you can realize how I came to be so op
portunely at band."
Sterling was arrested.
CAUGHT AT OCEAN SIDE.
Arrest of Forger Heather/ey, Who Escaped
From San Jacinto Jail in
September.
SAX DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 14.â W. H.
Hoatherley, charged with counterfeiting,
who escaied from jail at San Jacinto Sep
tember 22, was recaptured at Oceanside
yesterday and turned over to the San Ja
cinto authorities. Heatherley was arrested
on September 15 with spurious coin in his
possession, and on the night of September
22 he escaped, having in some unknown
manner removed liis handcuffs and forced
Ins way out of the insecure jail at San Ja
. cinto. He made his way to Austin Tripp's
ranch, near Sa;> Jacinto. where he stole a
horse, bridle and sadd.e and struck out
for Lower California. Though the effi
â¢ cers I. ere and along the line were after
dim, they failed 'o apprehend him, and he
made his way over the border.
HeaUseney became iscoiitented in
Lower < alifornia, ana made iiis way back
>>v-r ihe lin- lasi Monday, comin-; upon
. -the National City and Otay Railroad to I
National City, and there hoarding a surf
!miu :iain for the north. He got through
-thisciiy without detection and reached
. Carlsbad, where he leit the train. Th^n
he took a wagon ride as far as Oceanside,
und was arrested by Constable Meyers',
wlio recognized him from a description
sent out iast Se temb-r.
When Keatheriey was arrested he was
grettly anirated and heartily regretted
coming back to this Slate. He had in his
possession .Â» counterfeit silver dollar,
poorly made, and in his roll of blankets
wi re iound twelve- more dollars not yet
finished. All bore the date of 18s4. The
â¢work was miserably done and hardly liable
to deceive a child. Heatherley is a black
' smith by trade and 41 years of ace.
POSTHERS RESED SAN DIEGO

. â¢ SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 14.â Captain
' Lewis C. Moodlin and Henry Tlllson, who
â¢ deserted the junk Pckin at Rosalia Bay,
. Lower California, as the vessel was about

. officers on board the steamer Pacheco, ar
rived here last night, having rowed a dis

walked the remainder of the distance to
San Diego, 115 miles, all in seven days.
A German boy known as Stuttering
Fritz, who escaped from the Pekin with
them,, wandered away when he got to the
mainland, and was left to shift for him
self. : Captain Moodlin states that there is
no evidence on board his vessel that it
wa- engaged In , illicit guano traffic, and
tne seizure of the vessel by the Mexicans
is likely to become a complicated affair,'

STEAMER SUNK
OFF ROCA REINA
The Mazatlan Strikes and
Goes Down During
a Fog.
Passengers Become Frantic, but
' Are Rescued in the
Boats.
VESSEL AND CARGO ARE LOST.
The Unfortunate Craft Plied Between
Mazatlan, La Paz and
Guaymas.
ENSENADA, Lower Cal., Nov. 14.â 1t
Was learned here to-day on good authority
that the steamer Mazatlan, Captain Gon
aales, had been wrecKed in the gulf on the
night of November 6. No lives were lost,
although there were twenty-eight pas-
Bengers aboard. The cause of the wreck
is not yet known, but is believed to have
been the heavy fog and poor seamanship,
which took the steamer almost ten miles
out ot its course.
The point where the steamer now lies
almost entirely under water is called
Roca Reina, a treacherous place, between
Espiritu Santo Island and Ceralvo Island,
forty miles southeast of La Paz. The
active captain of the ship, a German,
stayed with tne vessel to the end.
First Officer Anderson was on duty
when the steamer struck. It was going
slowly and sounded the foghorn con
stantly. If it had been at full speed the
lives of all aboard would probably have
been lost.
As it was there was time to lower the
boats and get the passengers into them.
The passengers behaved badly, becom
ing frantic when it was found that the
vessel was going down. It is hinted that
there was a dispute between the two cap
tains, which added to the confusion.
The passengers were taken back to
La Paz. reaching there the next day, and
being taken later to Mazatlan by steamer.
The navigating captain stayed at the
scene of the wreck with a couple of sailors.
Returning later to La Paz he reported
that t.';e steamer had t:one out of sight,
but that its masts were above water and it
was resting easily in a smooth sea but in
imminent danger of breaking up with the
first rough weather. The captain said
there must have been a strong unknown
current In the neighborhood, as the fog
was not so dense that the steamer could
have gone off its course so far in so short
a time.
The steamer was on its way from La
Paz to Maz?tlan when it struck. It plied
between Mazutlan, La Paz and Guaymas,
and was the best in that service. It was
owned by Robert R. Symon, a capitalist
living in Mexico, and Sebastian Camacbo,
Mayor of the City of Mexico. The value
of the steamer was $150,000. The value of
its cargo is not Known, but it is not be
lieved to be much.
The Mazatlan is a steel screw vessel of
325 tons burden. She was built in 1891 by
W. Simons <fc Co. at Renfen, on the Clyde.
Her dimensions are: Length, 150 feet;
beam, 22.1 feet; depth, 10.6 feet.
Ashor: time after sue was built she wa?
purchas-ed by the Western Kail way Com
pany of Mexico and has lately been em
ployed carrying freight between San Diego
and Mexican ports.

No Longer Kept
Secret.
Enemies of the Senator Rallying

Governor.
PLANNING TWO YEARS AHEAr.
The Al'iance With Cator Belieyed to
Hays Undone the Crafty
Angeeno.
LOS ANGELES, Cal.. Nov. 14â The
overthrow by the voters of the State of the
White-Cator combine to control two ses
sions of the California Legislature has
brought into prominence the candidacy
of Governor Budd lor White's seat in the
United States Eenate two years hence.
The result of the election, it is univer
sally conceded, has relegated Thomas V.
! Cator to political oblivion, and at the
| same time has pushed lis associate dan
cerously near the brink of a similar abyss.
This has emboldened Governor Budd's
friends to openly avow his candidacy,
which prior to the election was barely
hinted at, and then only In the very select
circles of his closest supporters.
Budd's recent speech before the State
! Miners' Association, in which he said he
would under no circumstances be
I a candidate for the gubernatorial chair the t
second time, is taken to mean that he is a J
candidate for the Senate. In view of this i
a large portion of jlos Angeles County's j
Democracy stands ready to advance the j
j Governor's interests by every means at its j
j command.
It was predicted prior to the election
that in forming the alliance with Cator
Senator White was digging his own polit
ical grave, but the result has been even
| more pronounced than was then dreamed
of. Senator White has made many enemies
among his fellow Democrats in California,
I and especially in that portion south of
! Tehacnapi. These foes are now rallying i
i around the guidon of Budd.

STANFORD'S MEN
HARD AT WORK
Varsity Football Players
Are Showing Marked
Improvement.
During the Coming Week Their
Training Will Be More â¢
Vigorous.
COACH CROSS TAKES A HAND.
Shows the Young Athletes How It Was
Done When He Wore Yale's
Bine.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cat.., Nov.
14. â The football men went through signals
and lignt practice this morning, and, {
while several Varsity men were off, those
who were on hand played with commend- ;
able determination. Coach Cross appears
on the field constantly in his football
clothesâ the ones in which he piayed for â 
Yale against all the college teams with j
which Yale contested last year. He gets j
very much excited during play, and his
shouts to the individual players and his
evident interest keep the spectators in a I
pleasant frame of mind. Occasionally the
big coach gets in himself when he nnds I
the Varsity are too rapidly gaining on the 1
second eleven, and taking the part of the
second team he joins the struggling mass
and turns the tide with his great strength
and skill.
In a recent game the Varsity end made
a long run and cleared everybody. With a j
clear field before him hedasbed on toward
the second team's goal for a touchdown, j
It seemed as though he would certainly \
score, but players and spectators had j
reckoned without their coach. Cross be
came too much excited to resist the temp- j
tation, and straight across the field he *
darted for tlie runner witn the ball, bring- \
ing him down in his tracks with a low,
hard tackle.
Cross placed himself opposite the three 1
center men this forenoon, and for several
minutes kept them guessing what his j
next move was to be. One moment be j
would jump into one player, throwing ;
him off his balance, and immediately '
thrust another off to one side, leaving a ;
big opening, or yank him forward for live
m six yards. When he got through the 1
men were quite ready to call it cuou.h.
The work next week will be even more I
Vigorous than it has been this week.
Every effort will be made to work up â¢
more perfect interference on the part of j
the line men and more strength in the '
line itself. If the injured halfbacks are in i
condition by the middle or latter part of (
next week the play should be much faster !
than it has been. Two of the backs (Sea- {
right and Fisher) will doubtless be ready !
to resume work next week. Dole will
probably remain off lor a week longer at
least.
FOOTBALL AT SANTA CRUZ.
Watsonville's High-School Eleven Badly
Beaten by the Local
Team.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Nov. 14.â One of
the largest scores ever made upon the
gridiron was that recorded to-day after
a terrific struggle between the high
schools of Watsonville and Santa Cruz for
the county football championship. The
Santa Cruz Highs outclassed their oppo
nents at all points, as indicated by the
score of 74 to 0; but, notwithstanding the
uiiiiill struggle, Watsonviile put up^ a
plucky fight.
Features of the game were the bucking
of Bacheler, the end running of the half
backs, Bias and Hawthorne, the 65-yard
run and touchdown by Sears and the 50
-yard runs for touchdowns made by Uhden
and Sperry. The game was watched by
2000 people and Santa Cruz was simply in
the intoxication of football mania.

WRECKAGE ON THE BEACH
Evidence of Mishaps to Vessels
Off the Coast of
Oregon.
A Wooden Rudder Belonging to Some
Large Ship Comes Ashore
at MarshSeld.
PORTLAND, Ob., Nov. 14.â That dis
asters have occurred to vessels off the
coast during the present gale is certain,
wreckage having came ashore at different
places. So far as known nothing has been
cast on to the beach that would have be
longed to an iron ship; therefore it is not
to be considered that anything has hap
pened to vessels of the inward-bound fleet.
At Marshfield, however, a wooden rud
der belonging to some large ship has come
ashore. The gudgeons of the rudder are
badly strained, showing that the vessel
must have been in a heavy seaway when
the rudder was unshipped.
Wreckage is also reported coming ashore
near Gardiner, on the southern Oregon
coast. This appears to be from some small
'fore-and-aft vessel. A mast and spanker
boom have been lound on the beach, both
newly painted white.
Forged* a Monet/ Order.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 14.â Deputy
United States Marshal Oakes of Los An
geles arrested a man named John Mc-
Gregor in this city to-day on a cnarge of
forgery. The arrest was made on a com
plaint sworn out by H. B. Thrall, Post
office Inspector, of San Francisco, charg
ing McGregor with forging a money order
for $20 made payable to Mrs. Lena Erschig
from Butte, Mont.
McGregor is alleged to have cashed the
order at the Oakland Postoffice on Sep
tember 10, he at that time being known as
John Williams. McGregor was held for
examination on Tuesday. Witnesses will
be brought from Oakland and other cities.
Two Drowned year Fietorin.
VICTORIA, B. C, Nov. 14.-J. G. Miller
and J. H. Fuller, well-known young men
here, were drowned to-day in a boating
accident off Oak Bay. They went shoot
ing in a canoe with a companion, A. J.
Kitto, this afternoon, and in the tide rips
off Fiddlers Ree! the canoe capsized.
Kitto clung to the craft and was carried
by the current ashore to a small island,
where indians passing in a canoe rescued
him later. Fuller sank almost immedi
ately and Miller when last seen was try
ing to swim against the current to Chatham
Island, weighted with gum boots. He
must have sunk.
mil Re Held at TTkiah.
CAHTO, Cal., Nov. 14.â The officers

to reach the county prison at Ukiah to
morrow. The prisoners seemed decidedly
indifferent, and asserted their innocence
strongly. They are being conveyed sepa
rately and carefully guarded by the offi
cers in charge.

CONVICTS TRY TO
SECURE LIBERTY
Many Applications Are
Made for Pardons
and Parole.
The State Prison Directors Have
a Busy Day at San
Quentin.
A GOOD FINANCIAL SHOWING.
Promise of a Great Demand for Grain
Bags at Fair Pricesâ Ramon
Herrera's Case.
The Board of State Prison Directors
held a long session at San Quentin yester
day, tbe most of which was behind closed
doorp, the business beine that of hearing
the petitions of those convicts who desire
to secure their liberty on parole.
Besides this there was another matter
disposed ofâ the resignation of John Ruth
erford, the superintendent of the jutemill.
A year ago Mr. Rutherford was engaged
at $250 per month. The output of the mill
has not been fully up to the desires or ex
pectations of some of the directors, and as
tbe superintendent's first year drew to a
close he seemed to become aware of the
fact that it would be better for him to pre
sent hi 3 resignation, which he did.
From tbe statement of one of the di
rectors the output of grain bags should be
14,000 a day. For a time tbe output was
below that figure. This may have been
caused by the large number of convicts
who bave been at work building the Tibu
ron and San Rafael county road. At any
rate there was a general desire to econo
mize. '
Considering this and the fact that the
superintendent's salary was $250 per
month where that of the former manager
was $150 per month it was decided that
the economical interests of the prison de
manded the acceptation of Mr. Ruther
ford's resignation. It will take effect on
December 1. '
The same principle of economy pre
vailed to the extent that the board* adJed
to the duties of the warden the superin
tendeccy of the jutemills. However, the
warden was allowed an assistant, who is
to receive the title of overseer of the mill.
Warden Hale' at onco appointed to the
new position Charles E. Alden, at present
the assistant commissary. His appoint
ment was approved by the board.
Warden Hale, in making his renort,
said mere were several big demands for
bags, and inquiries had been made for
larpe lots. This was, no doubt, caused by
the recent rise in the price of grain baes
of from J^ to % of a cent. He expects
that there will be a large demand during
the cominc season. At present there are
about 3,000,000 grain bags on hand, which
represent many of the prison Uinds.
With a lively demand at fair rntes this
will liberate the funds considerably.
Warden Hale was authorized" to sell
100,000 grain bags at $4 65 pÂ«r 100, subject,
of course, to the provisions of the Ostrom
act limiting the quantity to each pur
chaser.
The matter of finances, so closely con
nected with the business of the jutemill as
one source of supply, was satisfactorily
considered by the board.
Tne following accounts of the prison
funds show that In the prison revolving
fund there is $100,000 and in the State
prison fund $7SQJ^O. Due on November
account, $17.(M 9o; due on the December
account, $5244 75; total, $22,936 70. The
directois have overdrawn the prison fund
by about $6000 or $8000, which amount is
more than offÃet by tbe November and
December dues, as here showD.
The one twenty-fourth act was sus
pended for two months by permission of
the State Board of Examiners in order to
keep up the running expenses of tne
prison. The amount overdrawn will be
more than made up by the November and
December dues.
With a good demand for bags on hand,
it is expected that the prison manage
ment will make a good showing ere long.
T^e Warden further stated that at pres
ent there are 1574 bales of jute on baud.
He further said that tbe mill will have
to shut down before very long in order to
renovate, clean and repair the machinery.
This will give plenty of the raw material
for some time to come.
For a considerable time during the
earlier part of the session the board pa
tiently listened to several applications for
parole and petitions for pardons for con
victs, etc. State benator Jones oi Oroville
appeared on behalf of Clarence P. Thomas,
who was convicted of attempting to ex
tort money from Major McLaiuhlin. It
seems that the young man bad sent to the
major for money, and failing to receive a
satisfactory answer followed up his re
quest by a letter in which Lie intimated
that he had certain papers and memo
randa that tbe major would not like to be
made public, the documents being of a
private nature.
Major McLaughlin would not stand this
for a moment and caused the young fel
low's arrest. After the arrest McLauehlin
found that all the letters, etc., referred to
were in his own possession, but tbe pris
oner was severely prosecuted and sen
tenced to four years' imprisonment. Now
the major and Senator Jones, who prose
cuted the case, believe tuat tne sentence
was too severe and both have petitioned
Governor Budd for a pardon for Thome,
who previously bore a good character. He
has served a little over one year.
The petition of Edward L. Baker of Los
Angeles for a pardon excited some little
interest. Baker was convicted of forging
a deed and was sentenced to fourteen
years, three years of which have been
served. Before his conviction he was in the
Los Angeles jail for two years. The latent
development is that he was convicted
upon the perjured testimony of a man
named Hoye who on his death bed made
h full confession that he told a lie in testi
fying against Edwards. The prisoner's
petition for a pardon is indorsed by the
Los Angeles City Council, the Grand Jury
and the petit jury which convicted him
Judge Ross, Stephen M. White, several
men wno are and have been district at
torneys and all tbe leading citizens of Los
Angeles.
J. T. Campbell of TJkiah presented a
protest of the citizens of Mendocino
County against releasing John Genochio
who is serving a long term for man
slaughter tor shooting J. L. Bureer to
death Â©.n July 3, 1893. The two men had
been enemies and meeting in a saloon the
quarrel was renewed and Gencchio drew a
revolver and fired rive bullets into Bur
ger's body. The protest is made by Mrs.
Jane Edwards, the daughter of the mur
dered man. The protest against the parole
is signed by over 600 residents of Mendo
cino County, who believe that the verdict
should have been murder instead of man
slaughter. Seven of the jurors who re
turned the verdict bave also eigned the
protest.
A. Dooley, the District Attorney of San
Benito County, appeared on behalf of
Fernand Soteno, who wants to be released
on parole. Soteno wÂ«s convicted of a
felonious assault and Mr. Dooley made a
novel plea by stating that the woman
who was offended was not the person
Soteno intended to assault. A strong pro
test comes from San Benito that the board
will pay some attention to.
An executive session of long duration
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIA, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1896.
followed, in which these and other peti
tions were considered. In all seven appli
cations for pardons and parole were dis
cussed. Two were fortunate, three denied
and the others left undecided. The fortu
nates were George W. Greweli and Robert
Bennett, who were released at once on
parole. Grewell was sentenced to five
j-ears for grand larceny and his time will
expire on March 1, 1898. Bennett was
sentenced to ten years from this city for a
felonious assault, and his time will be
ended in 1899. There is considerable
doubt as to the young man's guilt.
The application for a pardon by Ramon
Herrera was considered at the evening
session and the case was continued for a
month for further evidence. However,
considerable information was obtained in
addition to that published in yesterday's
Call. Isadore Baldivia made the lollow
ine statement to a Call reporter:
From the very ffrst I protested that Herrera
was innocent, of the crime of robbing the
Chinaman, but In my first statements I dirt
not tell who my partner was in the job. It
was in the latter part of 1893 that Slamuel
rortlllo and I stood up Leong Tom on the cor
ner of California and Dupont streets, and
robbed him of $25 and a watch. Portillo
sold the watch at a pawnshop. The police ar
rested Herrera ana me soon after, and when
Herrera was arrested he had in his pocket a
small black bulldog revolver. The officer
must have told the Chinaman what kind of a
revolver Herrera had, for he identified Herrera
and ihe revolver. Now thelact is that Por
tillo and I did the job with a big nickel
plated Smith & \Ves6on revolver, but the otflcer
I and the Chinaman were bound to convict
both of us. \
Portillo talked so m\ich about his bavins;
robbed the Chinaman and the finding of the
watch where he had sold It that it forced the
police to ai rest him, but that was a month after
Herrera and I haa our preliminary examina
tions in the Police Court. The Chinaman then
positively identified Kerrera as one of the two
who stood him up, and he did not dare to go
back on his testimony for fear of being arrest
ed for perjury, so he stayed by his first story
that Herrera was the other one (I had already
pleaded guilty). When we three were in the
County Jail Portillo and I decided to do the
square thing by the boy Herrera, and we sent a
letter to our attorneys, Alex Campbell Jr. and
A. B. Treadwell, telling the whole truth about
MATT L. BERRY, Theatrical Manager, Who Will Officially
Protect Dumb Animals.
the affair *.nd exonerating Herrera. Campbell
did not come near us, but Treadwell came to
Portlllo and told him that be was foollsn to
make such a statement, as he (Treauwell)
) couid beat the case for him (Portillo).
The fact was that thore was $100 in the case
for Herrera's attorney and more for Portlllo's
attorney as the case stood, but nothing if our
confession became public and the guilt placed
where It rightly belonged. Treadwell talked
Portillo out of making a confession, and I am
told that they got their money. When Por
tillo's case came up for trial he 'was apquittct
by the jury, which by their Action seemed to
believe that he was guilty, for the jurors di
rected that he leave the country. The jury
could not have done otherwise than acquit
Portillo when the Chinamen would only iden
tify Herrera. PofUllo tried to remain in San
Francisco, but he was arrested and shipDed
out ol the State to Mexico on the next
steamer. He talked a great deal, and 1 know
that he told many people that he and I robbed
the Chinaman, which was Hie truth.
I acknowledge that I did si-veral jobs of this
scrt, but this boy Herrera was never my part
ner, and be never had anything to do with
this kind of business that I know of. I csn't
say tne some for Portillo. He was my partner.
I don't believe the story about his btMnp killed
in Mexico for train robbery. 1 think he had
such a report sent bacn here so thai thÂ« people
would forget him and b.lieve him dead. He
will never dare to come back to California as
long as he lives. I telt nils only as a matter
of justice to this boy Herrera.
Herrera was also seen and hs still main
tains that he isinnocentof the crime wi!h
which he is charged. He is hopeful that
bis friends and the attorney, E. T. Shaw,
will secure his full pardon and place him
right before the public again. He pro
poses, if he gets pardoned, to do as he did
before â work hard and give all that he can
earn to his widowed mother. He ex
plained the possession of tbe black bulldog
revolver by saying that lots of boys of his
ace own sued firearms and tuat he never
contemplated using it for an unlawful
purposo.
The young convict is a bright, pleasant
speaking iellow and he does not appear to
be of tbe criminal class. Among those
who knew him well before his conviction
he is spoken of in the highest terms. He has
a large number of reputable citizens work
ing disinterestedly in his behalf to secure
the pardon.
DIED A FREE MAN.
Jainea Beehan, a i oi.virt. Pardoned
Just Before Hi, Death.
James Beehan died yesterday in the
prison at San Quentin, but he died a free
man. Beehan wa3 26 years of age and he
came from a good family. However, he
turned out to be a sort of black sheep in
the flock, and some time ago he was con
victed of stealing hogs in Sonoma County
and was sentenced to serve six years' im
prisonment in San Quentin. While in
prison consumption took a strong hold
upon his system, and it was necessary to
remove him to the hospital. Dr. Lawler
saw that the man was in a dying condi
tion, and when Beehan's family appealed
to Governor Budd for a pardon in order
that the fellow might die outside of the
prison walls the doctor added his approval
to the petition.
Tbe other uay the much-desired par on
arrived, but it was conditional and stipu
lated that in the event of Beehan's recov-
cry he should return to San Quentin and
finish his term of imprisonment. The
sentence was made to expire on Friday,
thelSth.
Yesterday Beehim's sister went to the
prison for the purposo of taking her
brother to her home in Ban Francisco.
She arrived a lit:le before noon, but the
man was fast sinking, and at 1 o'clock he
died. While her grief was great, it was
alleviated by the thought that her brother
died a free roan.
MUTT BERRY NOW
WEARS A BADGE
A Theatrical Manager Who
Has Appeared in a
New Role.
Special Officer, to Prevent Cruelty
to Animals in Tuis
State.
HE SOUGHT THE APPOINTMENT
Probably the First Mm n the Pro
fession Who Has Ever Yearned
for Such Duty.
Matt L. Berry is probably the first
theatrical manager in the United States
who can boast of being a special arresting
j officer of a humane society.
A lew days ago Mr. Berry, who is one of
tbe managers of the Corkine Extravaganza
Company, which has beer, playing at the
Columbia Theater, asked a friend to intro-
duce him to Frank J. Kane, secretary of
the Pacific Society for the Suppression of
Vice, his purpose being to engage actively
in the work of preventing cruelty to aiii
mals. The Pacific society follows that
line and also tho prevention of cruelty to
children. *
The next occurrence was a meeting be
tween the theatrical manager and the
secretary. Mr. Berry's application was
gladly received, for he seemed to be very
much in earnest and it was apparent that
in his travels over California he would
have large opportunity for doing good. A
special meeting of tbe directors of the
society was called at once and Mr. Berry
was elected a member and a spe
cial officer. The last-named position gnve
him the right to wear a badge, and fie will
be duly authorized by seme Superior
Court judge to make arrests under the
appointment conferred upon him.
The badge of the society has been often
pictured. It is of silver and is a combina
tion of a star and inscription and other
devices. Mr. Berry w:i3 in San Jose yes
terday, but returned last night, and when
Secretary Kane learned of tnis he went to
the Columbia Theater and duly invested
Mr. Berry with the insignia of office.
Both the secretary and the manager were
enthusiastic over the occurrence. There
j were a few felicitous remarks on both
sides, and auring the evening Mr. Berry
paraded with the lapel of his coat well
tbrown back to show the badge.
The glittering bauble caught the eye of
Junius Howe, who is Mr. Berry'a partner,
and the theatrical employes were dazzled
by it.
"It is just the thing," said Mr. Berry.
"It is shameful to have animals abused. I
have never belonged to- any society lor the
prevention of cruelty to animals before,
but I bave always been interested in the
I good worK of such organizations. Arrest
people? Why, of course I will. That is
why I became on officer of this society."
When the news spread to the Columbia
Theater stage it occasioned the greatest
interest. "Tell you what." said Corinne,
who was attired as Hendnk Hudson, "that
is the proper thing, you bet." Manager
Howe looked on somewhat enviously. He
may also join the society, so Berry said.
Expressmen who insist in hauling theatri
cal baggage with one horse when the load
requires two will be in danger. So will
all T>ersons who abuse dumb animals in
the State when Berry is around.
FOR YOUNG MEN.
An Effort to Secure 1200 Members for
the Y. M. C. A.
The members of the Young Men's Chris
tian Association are especially active just
now in increasing the membership of the
association. There has not been a time
since the institution entered its new borne,
corner of Mason and Ellis streets, when
the work was so aggressive and successful
as to-day.
A special effort is being made to secure
1200 members by the Ist of February. All
new members may enter the educational
classes n&til Decembers. This time has
been extended because of the political
campaign which was at its height at the
time the evening college opened for the
season. The membership fee is $10 a year
in advance, or $3 a quarter if paid in in
stallments.
Professor Cory of the University of Cali
fornia had nearly sixty in his class in elec
tricity and electrical engineering last Fri
day evening at tbe association. There are
eight other studies each week including
bookkeeping, mechanical and free-hand
drawing. These, with all the other privi
leges, are included in the annual mem

A VITAL QUESTION.
Cemeteries in this County Believed to
Be a Menace to Public Health.
Tbe question of whether or not tbe
cemeteries should be allowed to continue
witbin tbe corporate limits of tbis City is
an important one to tbe people v of San
Francisco. Arguing on general principles
alone, proof enough of the undesirability
of burial grounds in tbe midst of a thickly
populated community is in evidence.
Specifically the residents of the western
part of the City are interested in their re
moval, because they are a direct detriment
to tbe more rapid upbuilding of that sec
tion. Kyery natural sense, every idea of
progressiveness, argues in favor of remov
ing the acres of tombstones standing guard
over the gateway to the beautiful suburbs
of this City. Mock sentiment alone says
it would be desecration of the dead. Not
so; the bodies are but the dust of tbe
earth, to which they have returned. The
living souls have fled and live in another
sphere and scorn the mortal clay.
It is time some notice should be taken
of the matter o* removal, and when it
does come up it will be found to have for
its supporters some of the best element of
our City.
The death-dealing cemetery ridge is fast
becoming the center of a populous dis
trict, and health and property rights alitce
demand tbat something shall be done at
once.
A few years ago there were no suburban
tracts available for burial places, but now
in shadow of tbe San Bruno mountains
lie the San Mateo County cemeteries
which will probably be made the receptacle
for all the dead of this City in the very
near future.
MOCKT OLIVET CEMETERY.
Situated just over the county line of San
Francisco, in San Mateo County, is the
Mount Olivet Cemetery, the nearest of
tbe new burial grounds to San Francisco,
a nd consequently tbe most easy of access.
Mount Olivet is a tract of 217 acres, being
the largest cemetery on the coast and in
fact one of the largest in tbe country. Tbis
cemetery site, however, is a comparatively
new one, being established but two years,
and consequently does not yet contain
many of the more pretentious improve
ments tbat are to be found at some "of the
older San Mateo cemeteries. Mount Olivet
Cemetery possesses, nevertheless, a feature
unsurpassed probably by any of the others,
and that is in tbe contour of the land,
which is particularly well adapted to cem
etery purposes by reason of the location
and drainage.
The Mount Olivet Cemetery Association
is an incorporated society having for its
officers some of the most prominent of
San Francisco business men whose inten
tion it is to so beautify the site that in
course of time it will eclipse by far any
oilier cemetery in the country.
Already a number of prominent societiea
have made reservations of plots in Mount
Olivet for tbe burial of their dead, among
which are the Native Sons, the Improved
Order of Red Men, the Knights of Pythias
and the Ancient Order of Foresters and
several other benevolent associations are
nt present negotiating for the reserva
tion of plots as a final resting place for
their deceased members.
Mount Olivet is, however, non-sectarian
in its burial rights, ils privileges extend
ine as they do to all creeds or denom
inations. In tbe laying out of the grounds
the plans of European and Eastern ceme
teries have been followed. Great care and
attention was given in selecting a site for
this cemetery, which resulted in tbe
choosing of a most beautiful spot, located
as it is far from the busy hum of tbe din
of city life and where nature and art con
spire io surround tbe burial places of the
dead with beautiful trees and flowers, en
chanting scenery and works of monu
mental art.
At Mount Olivet quite evident is the
striking contrast of the gloomy, somber
and unhealthy churchyards of our fore
fathers, and tbe latest development in
cemeteries with all their harmonizing and
elevating influences.
Tbe lawn plan at Mount Olivet has been
carried out in every detail. By following
as closely as practicable this plan, with its
beautiful carpet of green, its stately mon
uments and graceful statues, its back
ground of native trees and flowering shrub
bery, ail combine to move the heart and
elevate tbe mind to Him who is the author
of all nature and bring to mind the loved
ones departed.
CYPHES3 LAWS CEMETERY.
It would be difficult indeed to find a spot
where nature has more lavishly dis
posed of her gifts than in and about the
tract of Jand occupied by the Cypress
Lawn Cemetery.
No expense has been spared to make
this cemetery .pne of tbe finest in all the
country, which has been laid out on the
lawn or park plan now so popular in tbe
East.
Cypress Lawn is situated in San Mateo
County, ten miles from San Francisco,
on the western slope of the San Bruno
hills. The land is rolling, aud rises
gently irom the county road to the
rear line. It has been tbe intention
to make the Cypress Lawn Cemetery
a peaceful rest ins- place for the dead
as well as attractive and pleasing for the
meditating of the living. In its burial
rights Cypress Lawn in non-sectarian in
its privileges, extending a3 they do to all
creeds and denominations.
For a cemetery of only four years, Cy
press Lawn bas made rapid strides in the
way of improvements. Its stately entrance
and imposing gateway; its quiet chapel,
surrounded with beautiful trees and shrub
bery; its green and extensive lawns, bor
dered with ever-bloominK flowers â all of
which add to the beauty and park-like ap
pearance of this cemetery.
MONUMENTAL AND MAUSOLEUM ART.
When mausoleum and monumental work
such as bas been accomplished in many of
the older cemeteries of the State, has been
erected at the cemeteries in ban Mateo
County, lending stately graces to tbe
surroundings, these younger and more
expansive cemeteries will exceed by far
many others in the State.
The Towne, Stanford and Kenttield
monuments and the E. H. Miller and
Simeon Wenban mausoleums at Moun
tain View, and the Fhelan mausoleum at
Holy Cross, all of which works bear credit
to the well-known contractor, G. li. Jones
of tbis city, are among the finest cemetery
work of modern times.
THESE MONUMENTS ARE PRODUCED.
One of the largest wholesale granite and
marble dealers and furnishers of supplies
for monumental and mausoleum work on
this coaat is the weil-knowu and reliable
firm of Jones Bros. & Co., at the corner of
Second and Brannan streets. Their sales
room is tbe largest of its kind on t c
coast, and comprises all kinds of marble,
that they manufacture themselves and
import directly.
Although Jones Brothers & Co. sell
only to the trade, all purchasers have
the right to order the goods ana work
manship of this well-known firm, who
have done Dy far tho best work of any
firm of the sort on tbis coast.

SHIFTED THE OLD
TO ERECT A HEW
Making Room for a Modern
Building on Market
Street.
An Elegant Three-Story Truck
house for the Fire De
partment.
TO BE BUILT IN NINETY DAYS.
The Landmark Constructed -in IS6g
Kept Company With Scrub Oak
and Sand Dunes.
Truckhouse 5, which has stood on the
south side of Market street, between
Tenth and Eleventh, since 186 i), bas been
moved from the place where it stood for
the past twenty-seven years to the vacant
lot on tbe east immediately adjoining.
Here it will be permitted to remain for
the next 100 days. In it the hook and
ladder and chemical engine, with the men
and horses attached thereto, will be
housed until the new modem building
takes its place.
The front elevation of the building is
produced in to-day's Call, ano" it will when
nnisbed be one of the best houses of its
kind in the City belonging to the Fire De
partment.
It will be three stories in heignt from
the level of the sidewalk, with a ten-foot
basement for the storage of fuel and horse
leed ana such other articles as may be
necesswy for the use of the department.
Tbe front will be of iron, with pressed
brick and terra-cotta facings.
The ground floor will be used for the
housing of tbe hook and ladder truck and
the chemical engine, with the horses at
tached thereto, with ample room for an
engine should one be deemed important
for that station.
The second floor will be used as a
"bunk' quarter, or sleeping apartment,
for the men, with a large assembly-room,
where the daily papers will be supplied,
as also a billiard-table, bathroom, etc.
The top floor will bs exclusively used as
a drillroom, where the men will be put
through their exercises as frequently as it
may be deemed necessary in order to make
them proficient.
Tbe entire size of the building will give
a thirty-foot frontage on Market street,
with a depth of 124 feet. Electric lights
and tbe most modern system of heating
tbe entire building will be introduced.
The architect, C. R. Wilson, has paid par
ticular attention to all tbe necessary de
tails for light and fresh air in his plans,
and with the contractor, Thomas Butler,
remains the work of carrying oat those
plans.
The contract price for the building is
$16,000, which sum is considered to leave
but a small margin for profits when the
work is completed according to the exact
ing specifications. Builder Butler has
ninety working days in which to finish his
contract.
At the time the old wooden truckhouse
was built in 18(39 the surrounding territory
was uninhabited and it was a lonely build
ing by itself, having the old San Jose
Railroad depot as one of its landmarks,
with Hayes Park pavilion as another. It
then had fourteen square miles of terri
tory to cover for its route, going as far as
the county line from the Potrero to North
Beach. Now four square miles embrace
its boundary of responsibility for calls,
unless a general alarm should be turned in.
The scrub oak and sand dunes, together
with Yerba Buena Cemetery, the present
site of the City Hall â have all been re
moved, and a commercial thoroughfare
has taken their places since thÂ« old wooaen
truckhouse with its alarm bell was built
and put in place on the sito from which it
has just been shifted to make room for its
successor. ________ ââ _____
A JURIST'S FUNERAL.
Many Chinese Merchants Attend the
Obsequies of the Late Hon. I*. H.
Van .-chalck.
Ex-Judge L. H. Van Schaick, who for
years past bad been prominently identi
fied with the legal practice among the
C.inese in tbis City, was buried from his
residence at 21 Haieht street yesterday
afternoon.
The luneral was in some respects a re
markable one, as a delegation of thirty

SELF-DENIAL WEEK.
How the Salvation Army Get* Honey
for Charity.
Tho Salvation Army begins to-day whit
is Known all over the world as Self-denial
Week. For seven days the officers and
soldiers will deny themselves their weekly
allowance, and wiil try to induce out
siders to sacrifice something for the sake
of the suffering poor. The proceeds of the
Self-denial Week are devoted to the
Women's Shelter, the Men's Shelter, the
Rescue Home, the prison work and other
NEW TO-DAY.
charitable work undertaken by the Salva
tion Army.
Some quaint stories are told of tbe self
denial that has been resorted to during
this annual attempt to bear the burden*
of others. Army lassies, richer in good
will than in this world's wealth, have
been known to cut off their beautiful hair
and sell it to give the price to the charity
fund, and children have bartered tneir
most cherished toys for a few nickels to
put in the army money boxes.
Tbe charitable organizations connected
with the Salvation Army have grown so
numerous of late that a special effort is to
be made tbis year to raise needed funds
during self-denial week. There will be
boxes for contributions at many of the
street corners, and an active canvass will
also be made by the energetic soldiers and
lassies of the army.
MRS. MARTIN'S SANITY.
It Will Be Inquired Into by a Jury
Next Wednesday.
Mrs. Susie Martin, who shot and killed
her husband in the new City Hall, is to
have an extra day of anxiety before she is
again permitted to breathe the outer air
and bask in the sunshine as a free woman.
Last Thursday Mrs. Martin's trial on a
charge of murder came to a close, and the
jury rendered a verdict of acquittal on the
giound of insanity. Judge Wallace
thereupon applied the provisions of the
Penal Code, which provide that under
such circumstances the prisoner may be
examined as to his or her sanity. The
j dge said tbat if Mrs. Martin is s"ane she
is a murderess and ought to have been
convicted; if insane she should be con
lined in an asylum.
Under the law it is the duty of the
court to pass on the mental condition of
the prisoner. Judge Wallace arranged
that this proceeding should take place
next Tuesday morning, but owing to the
fnct that be is called on to attend a meet
ing of the University Regents on that day
he has made an order postponing the ex
amination of Mrs. Martin until Wednes
day, tho 18th, at 10 A. m.

MR. FITZGERALD
WAS NOT THERE
The Regents Were Anxious
to Confer With the
Attorney-General.
Contract to Build Colleges Held
to Be Valid Without His
Approval.
UNIVERSITY OF THE FUTURP.
A Sketch From a Preliminary Draw
ing by Mr. Maybeck of
Berkeley.
Regents Governor Budd, T. G. Phelps .
William T. Wallace, George T. >iarye, H.
S. Foote. C. F. Crocker, President Kel
lopg. J. B. Reinslein, Cbarles W. Slack, J.
West Martin, A. S. Hallidie, B. A.
D^nicke, Charles M. Cbase and Major
Mhoou (attorney of the board) assembled
at the Mark Hopkins Institute yesterday
afternoon, expecting to meet Attorney-
General Fitzgerald and get the complica
tion over the Atliliated Colleges adjusted.
Tue Attorney-General did not appear.
Tlis Governor directed the use of the tele
phone to ascertain his whereabouts, but
no information on the subject could be
obtained.
Major Mhoon told the board that be
had conferred witn the officers of the Ray
Construction Company, and in deference
to the views of the Attorney-General they
were willing to strike from the contract
the words. "Folsom granite."
Major Mhoon was convinced by exami
nation of the statute that the contract
was valid without the Attorney-General's
approval. He cited an act passed by the
Legislature of 1895 which leaves the Re
gents and Harbor Commissioners entirely
independent of the Attorney - General.
That act repealed all functions of the
Attorney-General so far as the Regents
were concerned.
Governor Budd said the act qaoted,
amending section 472 of the Political Code,
was passed at bis own suggestion and was
designed to give the Board of Examiners
legal assistance. The title of the act ex
pressed its purpose.
The sentiment of the board expressed
by Regents Foote, Wallace, Marye and
Phelps was favorable to consultation with
the Attorney - General, although the
opinion was freely expressed that the
contract was valid without the signature.
Mr. Phelps was sure that the Attorney-
General would view the subject in a
different light when the fact was made
clear to his mind that the contractors
were not to be benefited by the use of
Folsom granite.
A communication from Architect A. C.
Schweinfurth was read and placed on file.
It was in tbe nature of a protest against
the method of procuring plans for the
Affiliated Colleges which the Regents
adopted.
The Regents adjourned until next Tues
day at 11 a. m. The secretary was directed
to communicate to the Attorney -General
the earnest desire of the Regents that he
should attend the session.
Since the receipt of Mrs. Hearst's gen
erous offer to sustain the entire cost of
the international competition of archi
tects to secure plans for fitting architectu
ral improvement of the university, much
interest attaches to the subject. Mr. May
beck, who prepared the plan from which
the accompanying sketch is n.ade, has
obtained leave of absence to visit Eastern
cities and Europe. Mrs. Hearst provides
lor his compensation and he will have
opportunity to impart his views to the
leading architects of the world. The
sketch was not designed to illustrate the
style of the buildings or the number to be
grouped on the site, but to show in a gen
eral sense the conditions.
FOR DUTY IN THE FIELD
War Department Asks for Names

National Guard.
Captain Carrington Directed to Send

Report
Captain Frank de L. Carrington, First
Regiment, United Btates Infantry, on
duty as instructor and inspector, National
Guard of California, forwarded his annual
report concerning the condition of the
guard to the War Department some days
since. He has been advised of its receipt
in Washington. The department has now
directed him to forward immediately a
supplemental report containing the names
of officers of the National Guard who
would be able to perform campaign duty
at once aa officers of the United States
army should the Government require their
services.
It is understood that this communica
tion Is to be confidential. The list is for

and well-trained officers Captain Carring
ton will base bis judgment on his own
observations as to the performance of
military duty by officers of the guard.
Four years ago, when a similar request
was made, Captain Barry, the inspector,
consulted with regimental commanders
as to the efficiency and qualifications of
the officers in the various regiments of
State troops.
Captain Carrington will not follow this
precedent. He has been on duty as in
spector of the guard for very nearly two
years, and has therefore had opportunity
to judge for himself as to the merits and
demerits of the commissioned Niu'ers of
the guard.
While the demand for this supplemental
report does not signify the War Depart
ment apprehends an immediate call lor
service in the iield of more officers than
the regular army can supply, it dues indi
cate tliat preparations are makinâ¢ for an
emergency. JSbou:d the emergency arise
the officers who are listed as competent to
command troops will receive first consid

Captain Carrington's supplemental re
port will be forwarded from Sacramento
within the next week.

cated claims at Red Doz and later he

from Boise. Here he met with reverses
for many years, and the result was that
till now he never came back to Cali

The colonel's whiskers are lone and
tangled, and likewise very gray. His face
is covered with wrintcles too, and he nays
he by no means feels as as formerly,
one reason being that he has the rheu
matism, which he hopes to get cured at
Paraiso Spnnes.
"I KOt $50,000 out of the placer mines at
Columbia," he said. "I hud previously
got $10,000 at Yuba and $15,000 at Red

hard cash. When 1 had it it didn't
seem like anything. I thought any man
who was any account could go out and
make that much. I even pitied men who
did not have sense enough to know how.
It never occurred to me that I Â£ad been
lucky. I attributed it ail to my own long

little old log cabin, and subs-iating on
bacon, beans and coffee. Ofteutimes I
have been lucky to get these. Then I have
been largely a recluse, a hermit.
"I have lived alone until the sight of a

me goins away to the remote frontier
from a State like California and there
passing my days in hardship alone. Some
of us don't know what's good for us, nor
what comfort is till age comes, and all we
have is a memory. I may strike it vet in
some of my claims on the Snake River
but even if I did what great good would
money do me now?"
The colonel has a reputation on the

will leave for Puraiso Springs in a day or

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1896.
FLUNG HAMMERS
AND HATCHETS
Serious Charges Against
Mate Harvey of the
Stetson.
His Arrest Caused Yesterday by
One oi the Vessel's
Crew.
CLAIMS HE WAS SHANGHAIED.
The Complainant a Sailor Whcse
Chircgraphy Rivals That of a
Batik Clerk.
Fiist Mate George Harvey of the ship
George Stetson, which arrived here from
Baltimore on the 11th inst.. was arrested
yesterday on the complaint of George
Williams, one of the crew of the vessel,
who charged the mate with assault and
battery on the high sea?.
Williams, who is an intelligent young
man of about 30 years, and who writes a
hand that a bank clerk might be proud of,
teils a story that promises to evolve some
thing more sensational than the alleged
brutality of Mate Harvey.
As a i reface to his charges against the
accused he stated that he is hot a sailor,
but a steamship fireman and never before
his voya_e on the Stetson went to sea
before the mast.
"I was walking along Caroline street in
Baltimore one day," he said, "when I was
approached and asked if I was a sailor and
it I wanted a job. I answered tbnt I was
not a sailor, but a fireman. I was told to
come along, and the first thing I knew I
Wii^on the Stetson. I explained to the
mate that I was not a sailor and told him
that I wanted to go ashore. He said to
speak to the Shipping Commissioner. I
did so and wai told to stay aboard that
night and on the following day I could go
ashore.
"When I awoke next morning the vessel
was far out in the bay and it was impos
sible for me to leave the ship. So you see
I was in reality shangbaied.
"From the day the Stetson hauled up
her ancbor on the 4th of July until a few
weeks before we got into San Francisco it
was knockdowns, beatings with belaying
pins, mallet*, hammers, batchets or any
thing that came handy. These the mate
would send flying at us on the least provo
cation, ana often without any cause what
ever. On one occasion that 1 remember
distinctly he yelled at one of us: 'If it
were not for the law, you , I would
put this hatchet into your heads.'
"But wnen we were within a few weeks
of this port he became as sweet as sugar,
expecting, I suppore, that we would for
get all about our mistreatment.
"I am not the only one who will make
charges. There are two othersâ Carl Rin
kie and Charles Hayes. They would do
so now, but the Judge win only take up
one case at a time. I can prove by wit
nesses everything that 1 charge and have
a written memorandum of some ot the
occurrences."
Here the complaining witness produced
his record, which displayed a chirography
that would have been remarked for its
beauty and regularity anywhere. This is
what it told:
"July 29, 2 30 a. m.â Beaten with matted
ropes about the head.
"August 20, 3 p. m.â Beaten with closed
hand encircled with 'palm.' (A 'palm' is
a leather fastening for the hand, fitted
with an iron thimble, and is used to sew
sails).
"September 1, 10:15 a. m.â Knocked
down with closed hand.
"November 6 â Struct with fist for obey
ing orders."
"If any man was spokon to," he con
tinued, "in a favorable way by the cap
tain, he was a mark for the enmity of the
mate from that hour. He would strike a
man without warning and without cause
simply for the love of it, as it seemed to
me."
Mate Harvey was arrested yesterday
morning and brought before Commis
sioner Heacock, who released him on $500
bail. The case will be heard on Tuesday.
MILITIA WITHOUT FUNDS.
Alameda'a Company AlÂ«o Lnckaa Cotn-
mantling Officer.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Nov. 14,â The mem
bership roll of Company Q has now the
requisite number of men to entitle it to be
recognized by Colonel Fairbanks and
c"raw the necessary $100 per month from
the State for armory rent. But all is not
plain sailing yet. Lieutenant Simpson, in
command of the company since Captain
Cbipman resigned in September, has been
unable to draw the State money. Already
two months have slitped by, and his
creditors are beginning to get impatient
at the delay.
It now appears that when the lieuten
ant first applied for the State warrant the
following answer was received:
Petaluma, Oct. 16, 1896.
W. .V- Simpgnnâ Sir: I Rend you a communi
cation from the Adjutant-General concerning
Company G. You can see somethinst must be
done at once there. You must get in new,
material and do it right away or the company
will be mustered out. Yours respectfully,
D. B. Fairbanks,
Colonel commanding Fifth Regiment infamrv
N. G. C. "
The communication referred to reads
thus:
Adjutant-General's Office. )
Sacramento, Oft. 15. 1896.1
Colonel D. B. Fairbanks, commanding FU'tn
Infantry, N. G. C, Petaluma, Calâ Sir: Your
attention is respectfully called to the report
of Company G, Fifth Infantry, for the month
of September, 1896. The membership of the
company for the latter psri of the month was
but thirty-five. Tnis Is in direct violation of
parHgraph 1, section 1962. of the Political
Code, aud imperils the standing of the com
pany in the euard, not to speakof the monthly
allowance of $100 to the company; the legal
ity of the allowance of which for the time trom
which the company is under the legally re
quired number Is questionabie, to gay the
least. Very respectfully, R. L. Peelkr,
Assistant Adjutant-General.
Simpson did not give out the reason for
this letter at the timÂ»Â» it was received, but
began at once to recruit his company. Last
Thursday night the roll nuraoered fifty
men and he applied for a notice for an
election to fill the vacancy. Tae call was
issued from headquarters for an election
next Thursday evening, with Major Dorn
in the chair. He failed to get his draft,
however, but in its place received word
that no money would be paid on account
of the company until there was a head to
it.
Lieutenant Simpson and Private Pickett
Dave been openly in the field for the cap
taincy of the command, but to-day Pri
vate Pickett withdrew in favor of Simpson
and announced himself a candidate for the
lieutenant's straps, and for which, it is
now understood," he has the support of
Simnson's following in return for his with
drawal from the contest with Lieutenant
Simpson.

SHE WINS MORE LAURELS
Music Lovers Make a Better
Showing at Yesterday's
Zsisler Recital.
They Begin to Rea!ia> That a Great
Artiste Is in Their
Midst
There was a better attendance at the
Temple yesterday afternoon on the occa
sion of Mme. Bloorafield Zeisler's third
piano recital. Possibly San Francisco is
beginning to realize that unless it bestirs
itself, and gives art the "glad hand" in a
somewhat less gingerly manner, there
might be a possibility of its losing the ex
clusive reputation it fondly reserves for
itself that of being a city of "art connois
seurs." Of course there is an exonerating
contention not to be lost sight of. Mme.
Zeisler did not chance to be Â»he "fad,"
consequently genuine unalloyed art has
been lost upon serried ranks of empty
chairs instead of gladdening the heart of
the traditional San Francisco "music
lover."
The programme yesterday was as fol
lows:
Gavotte and variations Ramean
Sonata, op. 31. So.' 3 Beethoven
.â¢' Warum," (Wh ?) op. 32, No. 3 Schumann
"Voyel ills Prophet," op. 82, No. 7 Schumann
Caprice (transcribed by Schumann, op. 3. No.
2) Faganln!
Mazurka, op, 7, No. 1 Chopin
Ktudc. op. 1, No. 12 Chopin
Ballade, op. '23 Chopin
"I.lebestraum" (Love's Dream) No. 3 Liszt
"Midsummer Night's Cream" (transcribed by
Liszt) Mendelssonn
The pianist's rendering of the Beethoven
"Sonata" was warm and richly colored.
The minuetto and trio were especially
pleasing, and for an encore she played the
dainty little Minuet in Â£ flat major by the
same composer.
Under her manipulation the "Warum"
by Schumann was a living, palpitating
question. One almost wonders if the com
poser himself could have made the mean
inc plainer.
The laughing, coquetish little Caprice
of Pagantni, transcribed by Schumann,
was given with sparkle and vivacity, and
upon an enthusiastic demand Mme. Zeisler
obligingly repeated it.
The Chopin "Mazurka" was played with
characteristic brio, and the "left hand"
Etude, Op. 1. No. 12, brought out her
marvelous technical power more bril
liantly perhaps than any number on the
programme. After an intensely sym
pathetic rendition of Chopin's beautiful
"Ballade" (Op. 23), madame delighted her
auditors witti the popular "Minute Valse"
(Chopin, Op. 64, No. 1), as an encore.
Li-zt's well-known "Liebestraum"
(Love's Dream) was played so tenderly
and plaintively that its familiar theme
assumed a new meaning to the ears of Its
many admirers.
The recital was brought to a close with
tbe wedding music from the "Midsummer
Night's Dream." This artiste possesses in
a marked degree the faculty of painting a
musical picture so that net an idea is lost
or the light and shadow blurred by a
single false stroke, and the Mendel sohn
music brought out this gift vividly.
To vociferous applause Mme. Zeisler re
sponded with a dainty little piece entitled
"The Flatterer," by Cecile Chaminade.
The last recital takes place to-morrow
evening at Metropolitan Temple.

ECONOMY THAT
DID NOT SAVE
High Statute Prices Charged
for Bread and
Sugar.
Judge Morrow Found They Were
Served Short on the
Viking.
UNCLE SAM A GOOD PROVIDES.
He Legally Prescribes a Dally Diet
for the Hen Who Plow
the Deep.
Because five members of the crew of the
trading schooner Viking, owned by the J.
F. Cunningham Company, were not given
their legal daily allowance of bread and
sugar during a voyage of the vessel to and
from the Fanning Islands, Judge Morrow
of the United States District Court yester
day awarded the complainants a pe
cuniary recompense for what they had
been deprived of, though they had not
undergone any suffering through lack of
such food. This award was made in ac
cordance with the statutes of the United
States enacted for the protection of Jack
Tar against the economical propensities of
ship-owners.
This is the first case of this kind that
has been tried in this jurisdiction for
many years. It appears that Uncle Sam,
in his solicitude for the merchant mariner,
has by law prescribed the daily diet of
those who plow the deep for a livelihood.
Among the things which Jack must have
for his sustenance are a certain amount of
bread, meat, tea, peas and sugar.
In the case of the Viking five of the
crewâJoseph Peterson, first mate; Wil
liam Bievers, cook; J. Johnson and R. Car
rooll, seamen, and Korea Sanowsfei, r.
Japanese boy, claimed that during part of
the return voyage to San Francisco.shortly
after the vessel had left Kusaie. Caroline
Islands, they were put on a short allow
ance of bread, peas, meat and sugar, and
were also stinted in the matter of lime
juice and sugar to sweeten it and vinegar.
According to the opinion rendered by
Judge Morrow the testimony showed rha":
the allowance of meat and peas was up to
the legal requirement, but that the sup
ply of bread and sugar was inadequate.
The captain claimed that the ordinary
ship's bread had been substituted by n
composition of one-third flour and two
thirds copa (dried cocoanut), but the Judge
held that this was far from containing the
same amount of nutriment that was de
rived from an equal weight of genuine
bread.
According to the statute, when the sup
ply of any one food runs short, owing to
the carelessness of the captain of the ves
sel or the owners thereof, the crew are
entitled to a sum not exceeding $1 per day
durinp the period of the shortage when
the supply falls below one-third of the
legaL requirements, and not exceeding 50
cents a day when tot >o shortage exceeds
one-half of the prescribed amount.
In the amount of bread, Judge Morrow
found that the shortage exceeded two
thirds of the statute provisiou for forty
nine days, and fixed the compeniation at
75 cents a day, or $183 75 for the five men.
He also decided that for twenty-nine days
the men received less than one-tbird "oi
the legal supply of sweetening material,
and for this deprivation he awarded them
75 cents a day, or a gross amount of
$108 75.
In the matter of lime juice and thesucar
to go with it, and vinegar, he expressed
the opinion that these did not come under
the food statute, but under that prescrib
ing the medical precautions to be taken
by the captain or owner of a vessel, and
suggested that a criminal action, having a
fine for a penalty, would lie for thi>
offense.

Day Dreams of Love.
TT IS AGONIZING to think how many such bright, happy
* dreams are shattered ; how many love matches are broken off
or possible ones never realized ; how many marriages end in
separation or divorceâ turned to hate, respect to contempt.
\. All this because of men's disgraceful weakness, which unfits
them to become the mates of pure and healthful women.
To those who have thus fallen â  into the cesspool of disease ;
who are weighted ; down under a secret load of shame and misery ;
whose precious manly power is slipping away from themâ to all
such persons Doctor Cook, the greatest of modern specialists,

up the fallen, to restore them to sturdy manhood and to the
proper enjoyment of either married or single life.

Wheel cf Fortune Beaten by
Lincoln.
The closing day of the Incleside track's
â¢â¢ semi-monthly meeting drew out the usual
Saturday throng. Fifteen bookmakers
cut in, and if they did not get a good play
â¢ it was because the blockmen were shy ana
' bashful and dodged the coin.
It was a good betting crowd that filled
the ring, and most of them didn't care
av nether they backed a favorite or an out
hider as long as the horse figured "a
j chance." Some very prouounced choices
L were served up by the ring, and, with one
4L- xseption, were burier 1 with imposing cere
mony. Of all the li/orites, and there |
were six, Pat Dunne's good brown sprinter
Preston alone saved the fraternity from
absolute bankruptcy.
It was a great day for Gene Leigh's
lightweight Allie Thompson, the cool
headed and clever youth parading past
the wire on three winners, all outsiders in
the betting. E.ldie Jones did not appear
â¢ to be in his best form, making bungling
worK of his riaing astride Wheel of
Fortune.
The weather was warm and the track
fast, as vouchsafed by the time made in
the different events.
Undoubtedly the seven-furlong handi
cap run furnished about the biggest sur
prise of ti.e day. Libertine as usual got
the short end of it from the handicapper,
being delegated to carry 121 pounds. The
big boy was made a 6 to 5 choice in the
betting and ran a game and true race,
although being obliged to rest content
with tecond place. The two-year-old
Geyser, with 87 Dounds in the saddle, led
throughout and won as he pleased by a
couple of lengths in 1:28%. instailator,
abominably ridden by McGlone, finished
a good third. The winner went to the
post 6 to L
The mile dash, called first, was a vary
open betting affair, there beiag no pro
. nounced favorite. When the horses came
out St. Aignon and Scimitar had the call
at fours, with Benameia, Favory and
Marcel coming in for good support. Rush
. ing the Bto 1 chance, Waiter J, out in the
"Jead when the eleven starters were sent
away to a beautiful start, Thomson gradu
ally shook St. Aunon off and brought his
mount in a nandy winner by a neck from
Benameia, which came fast at the end,
taking place honors from St. Aienon.
The five-furlong race for two-year-olds
saw Ed Oorrigan's Indio, a not even
money choice, go down before True Blue,
Âwho had the lead by the time the head of
tue stretcti was reached and won easi.y by
a length from the favorite. Dura was a
godd third.
â¢ . To say that JO C was a real warm one
in the mile and a half jaunt over six ob-
A stacies would be expressing it most
â  â¢ mildly. Opening at 4, he was allowed to
* . reach 6 to 1, and then the rush was made,
forcing his price aown to Sto 5. Willie
Harris had the mount, and after showing
pronouncedly for a mile and a quarter on
the chestnut he gave it up and finished
"absolutely."
Â» Gold Dust, with Bto 1 about liim, ridden
by WilKins, took all toe jumps in front,
and led Huntsman cut by four lengths at
the finish in 2:49}Â£- Zaragosa was third.
Supposed to Oe invincible, Wheel of
Fortune caused the short enders much dis
tress by going down to defeat in the mile
â¢and a sixteenth purse e\fent. In very
nicely, with 112 pounds in the saddle,
Harvey's mare was quickly played down

Lincoln, with 84 pounds up, carried the
coin of the handicappers. Jones, on the
iavonte, starte ! out to make the running,
tut took back at the first turn, anrt soon
fofind himself pocketed next the rail.
It u d Glen showed first as ihe field
swunp into the stretch, but gave way to
Lincoln, who fairly flew into first position,
and thereafter it was dear sailing for 'he
youngster, who won hands down in 1:49%.
In a very bard drive the first choice beat
Instigator the shortest of heads for the
place.
Even money Presion and 3 to 2 Summer
time caused a look of perplexity to be de
picted on the faces of the crowd aa they
gazed upon the names of f c seven
sprinters that lined up in the last event
of the day over six furlongs. It proved a
snap for Preston, on which Martin waited
until straightened for the stand, when he
let out a wrap, and, soon havine the sec
ond choice in difficulties, downed the
brown mare with something in reserve.
Ostler Joe finished in the show.
Notes.
"Gloucester" McDermott tried to con
vince aughey Jones that his colt Walter
J was a "cincb," but Hughey couldn't
see it.
St. Aignon was finally cut loose, and
but for a stumble just after the barrier
went up might have been closer the win
ner at the end.
With a trifle more judicious handling
Benameia would have beaten Walter J,
and the black horse will bear watching in
his future races.
Trainer "Billy" Murry had another hard
luck story yesterday. Perseus was slightly
cut down, and then to cap the climax the
"Dook" said Red Glenn had one of his
quarters lumped on by Instigator.
Al Stanford put uu a good ride on the
outsider HaymarKet In the hurdle race,
although lie mierht have saved a trifle
more ground by maKing closer turns.
It was pqssibiy very fortunate for Jockey
Enos that it was the final day of the meet
ing at Inglesidc. He rode Scimitar, who
was heavily backed to win the opening
mile dash, and the exhibition he fur
nished nearly caused Captain Rees to fall
down the steps leading from the judges'
stand.
That official observed the boy's esthetic
ride, and after races stated that it was
only because of it being last day that he
let riim off with a fine of $25. Enos has
ridden one or two winners of late, and
; perhaps now proposes to emulate the ex
j ample of '"Snapper" Garrison and other
j illustrious knights of the saddle by com
j ing with a rush when it is too late.
YOSEMITE MONEY.
Governor Budd'a Plan to Improve the
Valley and to Build a
Hotel.
Miles Wallace of Madera was welcomed
yesterday by the Yosemite Commis
sioners aa one of themselves in
the Mills building. He is the newly ap
pointed Commissioner who succeeds
George B. Sperry. Commissioners Gold
berg, Ostrander, Clinch, Boggs and Field
were present, and the Governor presided.
As Mr. Bperry was vice-president an
election to fill the vacancy caused by his
removal was held, with the result that
Henry K. Field was chosen. After this
Commissioner Wallace was introdnced.
Upon taking his seat Mr. Wallace said
that he entered on the duties of the posi
tion with a firm resolve to act with fair
ness to all concerned. The commission
immediately elected him a member of the
finance committee.
The commission proceeded to discuss a
plan for a new hotel in the Yo-ernite
Valley in place of the Stoneman House,
recently destroyed by fire.
Funds were low, however, and for that
reason but little could be done in the way
of improvements. With this problem of
finances facing the commission, Governor
Budd came to the rescue.
"We must have more money," said he.
"I have been tiiinking of a p.'an to tide
over the dilhculty. I shall recommend to
tar Legislature that a law be enacted em
powering the State to borrow what money
we may need from the regents of the Slate
University. I understand we can get all
the money we require by paying a fair in
teres: on the loan."
The Governor's scheme was approved
and Mr. Budd will have an opportunity
of carrying it into execution.
Before the commission went into execu
tive session the Governor invited the mem
ber? to accompany him on a trip to the
valley this mouth.

EACH SCORED ONE TOUCHDOWN
Much Playing in Olympic's Territory.
Opinions of CaptainsâMinor
Matches-
The Olympic and Reliance contended
yesterday afternoon for the athletic cluO
football championship of the coast The
game resulted in a tie, each side scoring a
touchdown and failing to kick the goal.
Considering the perfect weather, the im
portanceof the match and the well-known
fierce rivalry of the two big organizations
representing two large cities with hun
dreds of enthusiastic partisans, the at
tendance was not what the contest prom
ised, but the dollar admission was doubt
less responsible for a crowd little larger
than that at the ordinary preliminary
games of the season.
Olympic scored early and like a flash,
Even Professor Soule Yelled*
but never again, the playing during all
the rest of the game being confined pretty
much to Olymr-ic's *ide of the field. Re
liance scored about tne middle of the sec
ond haif with a touchdown secured in
much the same way that Cochran of the
Stanford varsity made the memorable
p;ay that gave his team the victory in the
inter-colleeiate Thanksgiving match of
1894. The ball was fumbled by the Olym
pics and Lacuna pursued it, in striving to
pick it up. k eked it along and finally
grasped it and rushed it headlong over
Olympic's goal line directly between the
posts. Wyckoff missed an easy goal and
the opportunity of winning the game.
The formidable army and navy ends on
the Olympic team prevented end runs by
the Bpeedy Walton of Reliance, for they
readily broke up interference and got the
runner. Had, it not been for those two
men Reliance must certainly have won by
a good margin, for Olympic did not have
the services of the formidable Stickney or
of Thierkauf, both oi whom are injured.
Weldon was a Joss to Olympic. Im
properly protected for his kicks early in
tne game, he evidently became rattled
and unreliable, all the responsible kick
ine devolving upon Code, who succeeded
fairly well from quarterback when the
opponents expected to see the ball passed

Frankenheimer and Fickert.
far back to the waiting Weldon, poising
some fifteen yards behind the line. Then,
too, Miley, soon after he was substituted
for Snowden during rhe second half, took
a turn at fumbling that made him as
dangerous a man to trust as Weldon.
Walton's long run was made partly
without interference. He tossed and
jabbed would-be tacklers as de as he
damned down the field in the old form
that early secured him a reputation on
the Stanford varsity. Snowden's runs,
due largely to his own speed and strong
style, were protected by excellent inter
ference by Code and Morse. Oliver, prob
ably on account of his recent injury, did
not show ui< so strong as be usually does.
Sexton's clever play in stealing the ball
from an Olympic back as he was ad
vancing it was a* feature of the game and
brouerbt its reward.
There were several attempts at slugging,
as is usually the case where strong athletic
club rivals meet, but no damage was done.

off. The Olympic score vvbs not made on a
fluke, like that of the Reliance, but on nard,
fa^, heady plays. It we had kept up the pace
we would have "don? things" to the Reliance
team, but in some way we either lost our grip
or the other side took a brace, and the conse
quence was that matters were evened up.
In the first half our men went round the
Reliance ends and through their guards and
tackles and did almost anything they wished.
After a while Reliance got on to our scheme of
running their ends and pushing their tackks
and set to work to stop it. The way they
General Sheehan Sadly Sees Re
liance Score*
defended these weak places after they saw
where we were hitting them hardest was
remarkable. They did good work in breaking
through our line and stopping Weldon's kicks.
Their clever work in this particular gained for
themconsiderable ground on several occasions.
I might say, as a general criticism for both
sides, that the interference on kicks was very
weak. The runners were too often left to fight
their way down the field alone. In the first
half, however, the interference in makine end
plays was very good, particularly tnat offered
by Oliver of Reliance to Walton and Carter.
Ames, our center, played a good game for a
man some time off the gridiron. Snowden
showed up well while he was iii the game, and
Morse made several line runs and tackles.
Hobbii, who took Captain Smith's place at
guard, got through in good style and brought
down his man nearly every time. In some
cases his tackling was too high.
Walton, Wyckoff and Sexton played the game
of the day for the Reliance, but their work
was not backed up as well as it might have
been for the best resul's.
It was a serious loss for us when Mclsaacs,
who had been given the ball to run the end,
dropped it. and it was kicked alone the
ground and then captured for a touch
down behind our goal. Dropping the ball
was the fault of a number of the players. If
Thierkaui andSiickney had been on the team
I am confident that the game would not nave
resulted in a tie, but in a victory lor Olym
pic, and thus we would have removed the
"hoodoo" that has been hanging over the
Olympic team for a number of years.
I am glad that the boys have decided to play
oft the tie next Saturday, und I hope that by
then the men will be in such condition on
both sides that they will not have to fake for
wind, as a number of them did to-day.
Thomas K. Code,
Quarter-back Olympic Team.
Harry Walton's Views.
Snowden's run in the opening rattled Reli
ance, and Olympic managed toiushthe ball
over.
Olympic's interference was good throughout
the game.
Reliance tackles were weak and were not
able to break up interference. Tne Olympic
ends were especially good, both men going
I down the field fast on kicks, thus probably
saving much ground to Olympic. Olympic
held poorly Cor Weldon to kick, consequently
he was called upon to run, end was often
caught before be started. The defensive play
â  ing of the Olympic was good, Reliance two or
three times losing the hall on the ten-yard
line.
Wyckoff's kicking wns a feature, anrl also
his tack. ing. The Reliance interference was
weak. It was unable to nold men back, ana
the Olympic dbcWs and ends were continually
brexkiug through and end runs were neces
sarily short.
The playing of Lacuna was especially good.
He is a young man, and is gradually develop
ing fnto one of the best ends on the coast.
His touchdown and brilliant playing saved
Reliance in the nick of time. The game, on
account of the poor condition of the men, was
much slower than the Thanksgiving game
will be. There was too much laying off of
men with imaginary injuries and too much
inking for wind.
Tne game ended in a tie, and will undoubt
edly be played asain nest Saturday, when
Reliance extects to hold the championship.

FOUNDED MANY PAPERS
James Travers Is the Champion
Proprietor in Alameda
County.
Started the Youngest Five Journals
and Also Owns the Pioneer News
paper of A m.da
Oakland Office San Fbawcisco Call.l
908 Broadway, Nov. 14. J
The spirit of journalism has already in
vaded the prospective racing town of
Emeryville and announcement is made
that a daily paper will be one of the earli
est features of that burg.
James W. Travers. the inaugurates of
journalism in Emeryville, is the cham
pion newspaper founder of Alameda
County. At different times he has
founded and carried on six paper.-i. His
first effort was the West Oakland Sun, which
ran for a couple of y. ars, when the East
Oakland Observer made its appearance.
The Sun is still running, but the Observer
changed hands, created a little furor and
a few months ago its then pioprietor was
arrested for felony and the paper has not
since been heard of. When the little
town of Elmhurst was started Mr. Travers
issued a Daper for Its residents while they
conld yet be counted on one hand.
Still later, when a little boom struck
North Oakland, Mr. Travers founded a
newspaper devoted exclusively to the in
terests of that section of the city.
About a year ago he deviated from his
regular path, and, in addition to being
the owner of several of the newest papers
of Alameda County, he purchased the
Alameda Encinal, the oidest journal on
this side of the bay. This engaged his at
tention for a time until the incorporation
of Emeryville was decided upon, when
Mr. Travers' penchant for founding
papers again came to the front and he
entered the new territory. Although
some of his ventures are no longer in the
newspaper directory, they all thrived
while under his management, and he is
now anxious for more towns to incor
porate.

GAME-HUNTERS
WANT PROTECTION
Prominent Sportsmen Who
Favor Commissioner
Morrison.
They Contend That Emenc and
Murdock W re A together
Too Fishy.
DUCK AND QUAIL IN MARKET
Dr. Hibbard States That the Commis
sioners Were Handicappid in
Their Duties.
The announcement that Fish Commis
sioner Morrison of Sacramento s dis
gusted with how his confreres have been
conducting the affairs of the commission
and now proposes to resign has set the
tongues of sportsmen and anglers to wag
ging.
Morrison has more than once announced
his intention of resigning, but up to the
present he has not fully made up bis
mind to withdraw from the commission.
The sportsmen of this City are seem
ingly in favor of Morrison holding office,
he being the only member, they contend,
who has given any attention to the game
side of the question.
Ned Bosqui, a prominent local sports
man, said that th â  Commissioners have
accomplished much good to the State by
introducing many varieties of food and
game fishes, but that they totally ignored
the suggestions of sportsmen who were
desirous tnat the game birds and animals
of the Sate should be at least protected if
foreign game birds could not be intro
duced.
"According to the game laws an appro
priation amounting to something like
$20,000 has been appropriated for tne res
toration and preservation of fish and
game, and for coHs and expens'-s of suits
for violations of hah and game laws $4000."
said Mr. BosquL "Now, then, I woul ibe
pleased to know how much of the appro
priation has been expended by the Com
missioners in the restoration of game
birds and animals.
"I can say positively that during the
closed season for deer shooting the Com
missioners were notified of the slaughter
of deer in Marin County, but they paid no
attention to it. They said in answer that
they had not a suflic ent force of deputies
to patrol the State, and that ended it. I
would like to s^e some men on the com
mission who had an interest in the pro
tection of game birds and animals."
William Kittle of the Country Club is a
great lover of fishing and shooting. He
ulso voiced the sentiments expressed by
Mr. Bosqui.
Doctor Hibbard took up the cudgel in
defense of the Comm.ssioners. He said
that they wer^ powerless to do anything
so far as punishing the transgre>sors ot the
game la vs.
"I know for a positive fact," said the
doctor, "Deputy Fish Commissioners have
made several arrests in this City of men
who were detected in the act of selling
game, and at a time when it was unlawful
to sell game, but in every instance a jury
trial was demanded by the attorneys for
the defendants and the result was imme
diate acquittal. Now, then, what can the
Commissioners do in the face of such facts r
"I am aware that you can see tven now
large numbers ot game birds in the mar
kets, but what is the use of arresting
those lawbreakers, they will co scot free
every time. Of course after the 15th inst.
game can be sold without any fear of ar
rest.
"Something should be done at the next
meeting of the Legislature by the sports
men of this City regarding the framing of
a law which will provide a means for the
punishment of those who laugh at the
law as it now reads.

into the track of a meteoric stream.
This stream travels around the sun in
an elongated orbit, from which we shall
be peppered for the next three years with
a constantly increasing number of what
are popularly known as shooting stars.
In 1898, when we shall have arrived at
that portion of the stream where the star
dust is thickest, an unequaled and bril
liant display of celestial hreworks may be
looked for.
It takes thirty-three and a quarter
years for these meteors to complete a revo
lution around the sun, and their track is
not uniformly stocked, so to speak We
are now beginning to enter the fertile
spots, and by 1899 the heavens will spout
fire.
No extraordinary displays should be
looked for at this time, as the earth will
not get into the thick of the stream until
November, 1898. From now on, however,
shooting stars will be seen crossing the
heavens more frequently than usual.
All these meteors appear to emanate
from the constellation of Leo.

Both the morning and the afternoon meet

The disappoimment of those who were

about three miles from Johnsburg by the
explosion of nitro-glycerine. The two

found, and only a few fragments of horse
flesh have been discovered. The shock
was plainly felt in the town of Johnsburg,
three miles distant, where some glass was
broken.

Attended the Foundation-Laying

908 Broadway. Nov. 14. )
Thirty-eight years ago this month Mrs.
- Si. K. Blake rather surprised the people of
Oakland by tpening a female seminary.
, She is now celebrating its anniversary,
'and during the past week has received
" many visits from gray-haired men and
â¢ women who were lads and lasses in early
MRS. M. K. BLAKE, Who Opened the First Female Seminary in
Oakland and Has Just Celebrated Its 38 th Anniversary.
Oakland, when she opened her pioneer
BchooL
This was before Oakland was adorned
with any brick builaings; before the
streets of the village had any sidewalks;
before there were any streets which had
been improved ; when sanddunes and oak
trees were all that could be seen north of
Eighth street, and when the only school
house in town was a shanty which was
'given by Carpentier to the city as pait
'payment of the water front which has
been so much in evidence in the State and
Federal courts for the past twenty^~eara.
At the anniversary exercises the invoca
tion was given by Professor George Mooar,
who blessed the institution nearly four de
cades ago, when the cornerstone was laid.
Mrs. Blake read a very interesting paper of
reminiscences, and drew a vivid picture of |
Oakland in 1352, when there were only
three dwelling-houses on the site of a large
city. Six years later with four pupils, she
commenced the work which she has had I
in hand ever since.
In the parlor of a little honse on B road
way, near Sixth street, which at ibis
time is the least fashionable quarter in
the city, she established a seminary. Al
though there were no railroads in the
State till several years later, pupils came
,to the Oakland seminary from all parts
of California, and, to a great extent, Mrs.
Blake's early efforts resulted in Oakland
being named tLe Athene of the Pacific.
Not until the seminary had made a State
reputation were grammar or high schools
established.
In early days the laying of a foundation
stone of a large building wa3 an event of
more moment than it is now, and this is
proved by the fact that in June of 1808 the
Live Oak Masonic lodge, ovÂ«*r which the
Key. Dr. Akerly presided, cfiiciatcJ at the
. ceremony of laying the cornerstone of
Mrs. Blake's present building. As usual
on such occasions, within the stone was
deposited a tin box containing souvenirs
of the times. The first graduating class
from the new house was contemporaneous
with that of the Oakland College, since
merged into the State University.
For the benefit of Oakland Seminary
thirty years apo Mrs. Blake imported
teachers from Eastern universities and
centers of learning, and these teachers
either came around the Horn or via Pana- \
ma, because there was no other way to j
come in those days. One of these teach- j
ers was Miss Harriet N. lield, and after
fourteen years with Mrs. Blak<? tho semi- j
nary passed into her hands and she moved I
to other quarters and changed the name
to Peld's seminary. In the course of a
few years death called that honest teacher
from ncr sphere of usefulness, and after
the seminary had been in charge of Mrs.
Hyde for some time Mrs. Blake decided to
re-establish the Oakland Semjnary under
its old alma mater.
In her own v raceful way Mrs. Carrie
Stevens Walter told about the old school
"and the many faces, then young, which
Were familiar iD those early times. Pro
fessor Adams and Rev. Dr. McLean had a
few words to say, after which there was
an informal reception of alumni, pupils
and friends of the old and present Oak
land seminaries.
At a banquet which followed, Mrs. Car-
Tie Stevens Walter was toast mistress.
Hon. William JR. Davis paid a high tribute
to the "Pioneers of Oakland." Mrs. Rosa
Hillebrand Hohfeld responded to "The |
Alumni of Oakland Seminary." Professor
GÂ«orge Mooar spoke of "The Pioneer
Christians of Oakland, 1 ' and refeireu to
them as "the voice of one crying in the
( wilderness." "Our Teachers of Auld Lang
IByne," was pretiily and tenderly bandied
Mrs. Lottie Hoag Hooper. Hon. Fred
&â â¢ Campbell spoke of "TV e' Oakland Col
lege School." He compared the college
boys and seminary girls of thirty years
ago as being one and inseparable In the
memory and in after life useless each with
out the other. "The Days of Auld Lang
< ce w C n" ed forth f . Tom Mrs - Mary Lnd '
wig Williams many interesting anecdote* 111 1
of the past. Mrs. M. K. Blake answered
-o "The Founding of Oakland Seminary."
Professor T. D. Adams replied to "The
Cornerstone," while Mrs. Carrie Stevens
Walter paid a beautiful tribute to "Miss
Siaattuck, our be oved and laithful frietid,
earnest worker and Joyal Christian."
In conclusion. Rev' Dr. .1. K. McLean
snoke of "The Founder of Oakland Serai
nary," and in a touching manner showed
how she had buildeci largerthan she knew.
He slated that no other private institution
of learning in California had turned out
more noble or better women than this alma
mater which for thirty-eight years has
been a shining mark in educational cen
ters of California.
May Solve the Mystery.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 14.â The Chief
of Police has received a letter from Q. H.
Strong of 227 Broadway, Los Angeles,
reading:
I OS ANGELES, NOV. 12, 1896.
Chief of Police: V. ill you kindly give me what
information you pcesess of the s-uk'ide oi a
man by the name 01 Strong, October 22, in a
lodging-house in your city. The words he left
sound so much like my brother that 1 think
had just got out of the asylum. I nave under
stood he was trying to get out. Any informa
tion you can give will be thankfully received.
A description of the man has been for
warded, and it is expected the identity of
the buicide may be discovered. The man
carried an "auraphone," a device for deaf
persons, and this may assist in the identi
fication. A card with John Hicfcey writ
ten on it was found on the body.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 14. f
An old-time campfire, which partook
somewhat of the nature of a farewell to
the headquarters of the Army and Navy
Republican League during the past cam
paign, was given by the veterans to-night
The gathering was mainly one of self
i congratulation upon the good work done
j during the beat of political warfare of the
j past six months.
The old soldiers partook heartily of
I camp fare with as much relish as after the
; victory of thirty years ago they sat around.
; their fires on the field and satisfied their
; hunger after a hard day's work on the
| enemy'i lines.
Though the veterans are old, their
) minds are as young as of yore, and with
out any difficulty many of them recall
tho exciting times of their early man
hood, when they gathered around a camp
fare, not knowing but that it might be the
last opportunity of meeting each other.
Somewhat of the same teeling prevailed
to-night. "Within the past year several
comrades have stacked tneir arms and
answered the final tap, and each one
seemed to be impressed with the idea that
he must make the most of the occasion
not knowing how soou their ranks may be
aguin thinned.
Colonel J. P. McElroy, the white-haired
and genial presidentof the ieaeue, walked
among the crowd as happy as ever, but
leanine just a little heavier on his cane
thau he did a few years ago. George Ho
guet. J. C. Colquohonn, E. W. Woodward,
W. R. Thomas, General Thompson and'
W. H. tfussey, all tall of form and mili
| tary in bearing, were araoni/ the most no
ticeable veterans present. They exchanged
anecdotes about the old Union leaders,
Appomattox and the old California One
Hundred, while many of the sons of vet
erans sat around and listened and won
dered.
But for the tokens of age prominent
among the veterans the scene might have
been one of three decades ago. The ball
was decorated to represent a camp scene,
ami t.e little iripod fires and stands of
old-time muskets placed in a natural man
ner all around must have proved a great
incentive to the memories of the old sol
diers.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1896.
OPENING OF THE
EBELL CLUB
New Home of Oakland's
Big Educational Or
ganization.
The Affair an Event of Great
est Social Promi
nence.
MANY GUESTS WERE RECEIVED.
Rapid Rise and Progress of a
Bind of Intellectual

Oakland Office San Francisco Call.)
. ' 90S Broadway, Nov. 14. : f
Ihe beautiful clubhouse of the Ebells
was formally opened to-night by a swell
reception. The affair was a marked social
event and was largely attended. Proba
bly not less thai a thousand were received
by the reception committee during the
evening. After twenty years' existence
this ladies' club has a home worthy of
itself and the affair of this evening was
an expression of the happiness of its
members.
As first organized by Professor Ebell, a
popular teacher in this city, it was a kind
of federation of study classes. Tnese
classes met in the parlors of different
ladies inter- sted; each class had its leader
or cuiator, who directed the studies, and
once a month there was a general meet
ing; at first this also was held in a parlor,
but later on in a bail; at each of the gen
eral meetings some one of the classes
would report uDon its progress, papers
would be read and there would be a little
music. All of this tended to serious,
profitable work, but it was often somewhat
heavy, not to say dull.
Its later growth began about the time of
the removal from the old contracted quar
ters in Hamilton Hall tp better ones on
Telegraph avenue, when Jiiss Horton was
the president ; but most of the advance has
been made curing th^ live years' presi
dency of Mr?. Georte W. Bunneli. In that
time the club has moved into the quarters
at Fourteenth and Washincton streets,
and has outgrown them; it has attained
the standing and numbers which made
necessary the beautiful new clubhouse on
Harrison street.
Soon after moving into the Fourteenth
street rooms the way* of the club changed
to quite an extent. There was more fre
quent comine together of the members and
more ot the club spirit ; the rooms came to
be a place for dropping in at all hours,
when the members happened to be down
town. The Tuesday luncheons were in
stituted and became very popular. The
chaiacter of the Saturday afternoon as
semblies was changed to make them more
generally interesting. Friday afternoons
devoted to discussions of topics of interest
were instituted, and also a series of Thurs
day evening lectures.
Out of it all there arose a dub patriot
ism and a solidarity of interests beiorc un
known.
The reception committee last evening
and its twenty assistants were in full
dress, but the many guests and members
were in calling costume. The large audi
torium was beautifully decorated, and
nothing but compliments were heard on
all sides.

BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 14.â Rev. W. F. Binney, the newly elected pastor
of the First Baptist Church of Berkeley, arrived yesterday from Southern
California, with his wife and daughter. They will take up their home at 2241 *
Haste street, and Mr. Binney will begin work in his new field at once. Hi*
first sermon as pastor will be preached to-morrow morning. The new pastor
comes direct from Orange, where he has been pastor for several years of a
church about the same size as the one to which he comes in Berkeley. He
has spent eleven years in the work of a pastor in Southern California, having
been for a number of years at Fallbrook, in San Diego County. In speaking
of his work in Berkeley, he said: "The people of the church here gave me
such a hearty call that I felt that it was mv duty to come here and to help in
building up tLe church. They have been without a pastor for about a year
and a half and of couree the work is not organized now, as 1 hope to have it
very soon. My immediate work will be to become as well acquainted as pos
sible and to gather in the flock."
At the present time the church has about eighty members and a Sunday
school of seventy-five. The trustees are James Sharp. Byron Underwood

DISCORD IN A CHURCH.
Berkeley Methodists May Organ
iz3 a Religious Body of
Their Own.
v
Trouble Caused by Teaching R?gard
ing the Approach of the
Mi lennium.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Nov. 14.â The dis
sensions in Trinity M. E. Church, arising
from doctrinal differences of members,
now threaten to result in open schism,
and it is said that E. A. Girvin, the leader
of the Bible class, ia about to form a church
of his own.
Mr. Girvin is away on business, but it is
repcr ed that he and his followers will
organize a church similar to the Los
Angeles Church of the Nazarene.
The first cause of discord in Trinity
Church arose some months ago, when Mr.
Girvin began to express in his Bible
classes radical views regarding t c
"second advent" and the approach of the
millennium. A large number of the mem
bers of the church disagreed with his
doctrine and much discussion was aroused.
Recently, upon Dr. Bentley's return
from Eur oj. y e, the breach between the two
factions was widened by the pastor's in
disposition to ent r into the support of a
aeries of "holiness meetings" that had
been commenced by the Girvin laction.
Holiness and sanclirieation were the sub
jects of the gatherings, which ara de
clared to have aroused enthusiasm which
caused a number of young men to leave
their business, 83 young Payzant and
PÂ«rktiurst left college to prepare for the
â¢'second coming."
I'resident Kel ogg't Feport.
BERKELEY, Cal.. Nov. 14.â President
Kellogg aas prepared a reoon to Governor
Budd of the condition of the university
during the past two years. The report
contains criticisms of the fraternity life at
Berkeley. The president thinks that the
"irats" do not exercise sufficient care in
selecting thelrmembers and that freshmen
who enter the university are too ready to
join societies w.thout proper deliberation.
"In the absence of dormitory buildings,"
says the president, "there is an increas
ing tendency amoner the jtuctent3 to find
homes in fraternity houses. These ira
ternitiea depend for their healthful tone
on the individual members. At best they
form pleasant and profitable homes for
high-minded and earnest students. With
an inferior constituency they exert an un
favorable influence, leading to a waste of
time, or even to a deterioration of char
acter.
"It is highly important that a young
man should have time to act deliberately
in the choice of fraternity companions.
Such deliberalion is at present impaired
by the haste with which pledges are ob
tained from newcomers.
".Parents shou;d advise their sons to de
fer their fraternity membership until
they feel at home in the university and
can be sure of the fellowship they enter.
The fraternities themselves should agree
to postpone pledging for at least the first
term of the frpshman year."
President Kellogg also discusses the
financial difficulties of the university and
makes a plea for a more liberal allowance
from the State.
I>iv*Â«ly Football Game.

SNOW`S FORTUNATE GUESS
Decided Upon a Tax Levy and
Made Bills to Agree
With It.
As Soon as the Levy Was Fixed He
Was Pn pared to Commencs
Receiving Taxes
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Cali*(
90S Broadway, Nov. 14 )
City Auditor Snow made a guess last
week, and he now considers that he had a
better stroke of luck than if he had played
a ten-spot in a China lottery.
For three or four months the taxpayeis
of Oakland have been wondering when
they should hear how much they were to
be assessed for municipal purposes during
the current fiscal year. Their anxiety
only ended Thursday night, but great was
their surprise to nnd their tax biUs all
ready lor them the lirst thing on Friday
mornine.
It usually takes ten days with an ertra
force of cl rks to prepare all the tax bills
of the city aft-.r the levy has been made.
There are two or three calculations to be
made on each bill for both the first and
second installments, and altogether not
less than 50.000 little sums have to be
worked out before the Treasurer is ready
to collect taxes. This year, owing to the
extraordinary gue-sing ability of Auditor
Snow, all this time was saved. Two weeks
ago he did some figuring for himself and
came to the conclusion that a tax levy of
$1 10 was necessary in order to enable the
Council to carry out its desires. At that
time the Council did not know what fig
ures they would ultimately decide upon,
and were somewhat amused at Mr. Snow's
premature confidence.
Tne Auditor went ahead, carried out all
their bills, relying on his estimate oi $1 10,
and before the levy was passed he was
prepared for the rush of taxpayers that
came Friday morning. It was a boid
venture on his part, for had the levy been
even one cent different from what it is,
>Ir. Snow wou:d have been juit to an
enormous personal expense. He would
have been required to employ clerks and
to furnish a new set of tax bills, for tde
City would certainly not have paid for
them twice. As the result proved, his
guess was exactly correct, and he is now
congratulating himself that he has piven
the taxpayers plenty of time in which to
pay up and to avoid any ooseibie penalty
for delinquency which might otherwise
have been incurred.
"For seven years." said Mr. Snow, "I
have been in this office, ever since the new
charter was adopted, and I am almost vain
enough to believe that I can judge the
amount of money required to run the
City as well as anybody at the City Hall.
On this occasion nine out of eleven coun
ciimen agreed with me, so my guess was
not very wide ot the mark."

A British Tramp Now
Loading for Central
American Ports.
She Is at Lombard Street and
Will Take an Unusually
Heavy Cargo.
PARTY ON THE SHENANDOAH
They Were the Gu sts cf Mr. and
Mrs. George W. McNear at
Port Costa.
The British steamer Amarapoora, now
loading at Lombard-street wharf for Cen
tral American ports, is taking on an
enormous load. She looks even deeper
than she really is, as she has no bulwarks
and is flush-decked. In consequence, the
remark is often heard aiong the water
front that the vessel is dangerously over
loading. Forward accommodations for a
number of horse* and cows have been
built, and food for tbe livestock was pour
ing aboard yesterday. The big tramp has
accommodations for about thirty passen
gers, aud there are now nearly fifty appli
cations on file. Captain Cameron will
only carry about half a dozen gentlemen,
who have already bespoken passages, as
the deck load will be a big one and the
space for passengers limited. Although
the Amarapoora is listed as an opposition
ship to the Pacific ilail Steamship Com
pany, still, strange to say, sh? is carrying
a considerable quantity of freight on the
Southern Pacific's account.
The tramp steamer Lennox will prob
ably forfeit her charter. She was thirty
two days coming from Japan, aud her
bottom is so foul that it would be impos
sible to again leave port without gome on
the drydock. In expectation of her arri
val a berth was secured at Powell-street
â wharf, and when the steamer got in yes
terday an attempt was made to dock her
at once. Captain Williamson refused,
however, and said he would sooner forfeit
bis charter than load without having the
vessel's bottom cleaned. In her present
condition the Lennox cannot make more
than fiye knots an hour, whi c when in
good order she can make ten knots. The
master reasons that with the vessel in her
present foul condition he would have to
stop several times to coal and that the
extra price on the charier would be far
more than ea'<en up. The chances are that
Captain Williamson and G. Wj McNear,
the charterer, will come to an understand
ing to-morrow.
The big American ship Shenandoah was
towed to Port Co.-ta 10 .oad wheat yester
day by ihe Fearless. George \Y. McNear,
the charterer, had a party of friends spend
the night in Port Costa in an impromptu
dance on deck. Among those who went
up on tbe Shenandoah were:
Mrs. J. C Tu< ker, Mr. and Mrs. Orestes
Pierce, Mr. Â«nci Mrs. W. Wayman, Mr. and
Mrs. P. A. Williams, Miss M. Magre. Miss
Pierce, Hbi . cDOÃjud, Miss ilyrn Prathur,

Kee, Dr. Philip Brown, ired McNear, Harry

It was 4 p. m. before the tug got the shin
away from Harrison-street wharf, ao it
was impossible to dock when Port Costa
was reached. Captain and Mrs. Murphy
made everybody comfortable, however,
but nevertheless it was a very tired party
that came back to Sau Francisco ou the
first train this morning.
The launch Amy is in commission again
after a tho:ough overhauling. Yesterday
she took a party of excursionists amund
the bay and made remarkably good time.
Henry Peterson is now ready to issue a
challenge to the Athlete, and is confident
that George Knight cunnot beat his boat.
The repairs on the Czarina are now
almost compieted and in a ew weeks she
wiil have her trial trip. Yesterday the
smokestack was put in, and as the boiJers
were in place several days ago it will only
take a short time to rut on the finishing
touches. When completed the Czarina
will be one of the best colliers on the
const.
Bids for the repairs to the Umatilla were
opened by Goodall, Perkins & Co. yester
day, and the Union Iron Works was found
to be tbe iowest. The bid will be sub
mitted to the underwriters to-morrow,
and the chances are mat the vessel will go
on the drydock early this week. Inside of
six weeks Captain C. Miner Goodall ex
pects to see ihe Umatilla on her usual run
to Puget Sound again.
Says the Commercial News:
One of the finest ships now in this port is
the Germau steel four-mnstedbarfc Niobe, 1984
tons, which arrived here on November 10 :rom
Iquique after a smart passage of forty days,
consigned to Morms & Kalteabach. Cnptain
Jordan made a quiCK triD, but was m staken
in thinking that he had bronen the record.
The Norwegian hark Jlazgar arrived here on
December 3, 1885, from Iquique after a pug
sage of thirty-nine days. The distance irom
here by sailing route is 6470 miles, and any
vessel that can make that distune.- in fony
days must be a speedy traveler. On one day
the Niobe made 240 miles. It may interest
shipping men to know that the Niube was,
when here last, the British ship Damson Hill.
She wns buiu by Hariand & Wolff, Ht Belfast
in 1893, and cost Â£22,000. On March 19 last
she was sold at auction at Liverpool and
fetched Â£12.900, the buyers being Gildemeis
ter <& Ries oi Bremen, which is now the home
port 01 the vessel. The Niobe made the trip
irom Newcastle-on-Tyne to Iquique in eighty
days.
Captain Burns, who raised the BlaiÂ»-
-more and went from here to Astoria to
get the Glenmorag off the beach, is hav
ine trouble up there. While kedging the
vessel out a storm came up and the cable
parted and the Glcnraorac; went ashore
again broadside on. Nothing more will be
done with her until fine weather sets m.
In his yearly report Chief Engineer
Holmes has this to say about, tee ferry
foundation:
This piece of concrete, pile and grillage
work is undoubtedly one of the largest, if not
the largest, of its kind in the world, and re
quired the removal of some 3000 old and sub
merged piles in addition to the concrete, pile
and cement work above mentioned. On an
average 150 men were employed continuously
for over two years; there was not an accident
of any kind whatsoever, and ferry-boats made
half-hourly trips from toe locality and were
not delayed one minute and did not lose a siu
gle trip durinz the whole time.
Several tests of the foundation have
been male and it sustained from 90 to 100
pounds to the square foot.

Brigadier-General A. W. Greely, the
Chief of the United States Signal Service
and famous Arctic explorer, arrived here
yesterday. #
He is on an inspecting trip and is espe
cially interes'ed in doing all he can to
get cables laid in San Francisco harbor
from one military station to another. This
work he regards as very important.
The general has not been as far West as
this for a long time. He registered at the
Paluce on his arrival, but soon ordered his
baggage sent to San Jose, where he ex-
BRIGADIER-GENERAL A. W. GREELY, Chief of the United
States Signal Service*
pected to follow it in the evening. Then ]
he went to the United Sta'es Army Head
quarters in the Phelan building.
It was there that a Call representative
met him. He still wears the prodigious
whiskers which marked him of old, but.
they are tinged a little with gray.
â¢'I had not been to San Francisco for
five years," explained the general, "so I
thought I would come out here. In the
old days when I was stationed here I icnew
ail about San Francisco and had no diffi
culty in getting around, Dut I find things
different here now.
"While I came West on an inspecting
trip and inspected the offices at Leaven- j
worth, Denver and other places, I am par- |
licul rlv interested in the b.vsiem of
cables, which ace so greatly needed to pro
tect the harbor of San Francisco. There
should be direct and immediate communi
cation between all the military stations
around the bay.
"I have been trying for five years to get
the money necessary for San Francisco,
but I have not got a cent thus far. We
hope to get it now soon. New York, Bos
ton and San Francisco have asked for
$20,000, and of this amount it is expected
San Francisco will get $SOOO.
"The cabK-s that were laid from Fort
Foint to various points about the bay
where there are stations are old and have
rotted. In places it is impossible any
longer to use them as a means of comma
nicntion. In a time of danger we would
be in a very bad condition lor simultane
ous action at the various stations. In fact
instant action would be impossible.
"We all hope to get thi9 appropriation
and then new cables will be immediately
laid.
"In Arizona and 'elsewhere lam more

graph lines. We are building a pew line
now frnm the town of San Bernardino, in
Arizona, to Bisbee. It will be sixty miles
long, and will connect with other lines
along the border of Arizona and Mexico.
Tbe object, of this is to quicker catch the
Indians that commit depredations there.
"As it now is the Apache and other
Indians zigzag and dodge about from one
side of the line to the other. They come
up from the Sierra Marire Mountains in
Mexico, steal and probably kiil, and then
go back to the other side. And as the law
now is with Mexico wecan't pursue them,
except upon what is called a 'hot trail.'
"So we want to get in such shape that we
can keep the trail hot. Then we will get
rid of these border outlaws. I will go
from here to San Jose, but will return on
Monday and remain several days, and
will then go to Fort Grant, Arizona, to ex
amine into matters relative to the military
teli graph hne."
Chief Signal Officer Green, in whose of
fice in the Phelan building General Greely
was, explained the proposed laying of the
cables in San Francisco harbor. He
said one would be laid from Fort Point to
Lime Point; another from Biack Point to
Alcatraz; another from Alcatraz to Angel
Island, and one from Angel Island to Tib
uron. The cable from Tiburon to Angel
Island is broken and has been for almost
three months, yet, strange to say, commu
nication is still kepi up.
It is accomplished, as Officer Green sÂ«ts
forth, by a curious appliance of one of the
officers by means of telephones. Nothing
like it has ever been done before, and it is
regarded as a very strange thing since it
is done through probably five or six feet
of water, the ends of the wire being that
far apart.
General Greely is now 52 years old. He
served through the entire war as a volun
teer, and Irom 1869 to 1871 was transferred
to Ornaha in the regular army. While
there he was in the signal service. In
18S1 he was in the office ol the chief signal
officer of tiie army at Washi gton, and was
employed later as a station inspeoior and
superintendent of construction of military
telegraph lines to TexaÂ«.
Immediately following this he was as
si ned totiie command of the Lady Frank
lin Bay Expedition to Northern Greenland.
He and his men suffered great hardship,
the general and a few otners being finally
rescued by a relief expedition. General
Greely surpassed all other explorers to
thai time, ana reached the most northern
arctic point. His book, "Three Years
of Arctic Service," details the strange and
hazardous details of the cruise.

RUSHED TO HER
FATHER'S RESCUE
A Little Girl Stays the
Wrath of a Deputy
Sheriff.
George Merrick's Narrow Escape
From a Very Rough
Handling.
STRUCK BIG "J]M" DEGAN.
A Fortumte Groceryman Who H d a
P u:ky Daught r to Intercede
for Him.
A little toddling girl scarce 3 years of
age prevented what might have proven a
desperate battle between a Deputy Sheriff
ana her enraged father a few days ago,
and incidentally saved her parent from a
severe handling.
George Merrick keeps a grocery at 416
Thirteenth street, and, falling in arrears
to one of his creditors in the sum of $23,
was attached for the amount.
He acted in a surly manner when Sheriff
Whelan's men came to take charge, but a
keeper was put in possession and the dep
uty who served the attachment returned
to the City Hall.
MfÂ»rriclt acted "uglier" than ever when
the keeper's companion had departed, and
the latter, fearing trouble, left the store
for a moment and went to the nearest tele
phone, to which he was directed by Mer
rick, to ask his office for an additional
man. He had no sooner turned nis back
than Merrick discharged his clerk, locked
the doors and announced that any one
who tried to enter woul "do so at his peril.
The telephone message reached Deputy
''Jim" De^an at the Sheriff's office, and he
jumped into a bugt-y with another deputy
and drove to the grocery.
Lace curtains partly obscured the in
terior, and before he realized that he had
a fight on bis hands Merrick rushed for
ward and struck him a terrific blow on
the jaw, nearly knocking him out of the
wimiow.
The blow sent his blood to the boiling
point, and in an instant groceryman,
deputy and lace curtains were mixed up
on the floor, both men fighting for tbe
upper hand.
By this time other deputies were in the
room, and the outlook would hay been
back for Merrick except for a sudden in
terruption. The door of the room flew
open, revealing Merrick's wife and little
girl, both crying bitterly. Tbe child ran
forward, crying:
"Don't hurt papa! Please don't hurt
para !"
Excited and angry as he wns, Degan
stayed his hand. Merrick was jerked to
his feet and stood up against tbe wall,
where Degan eyed him and the child al
ternately.
Tne child clasned her arms around one
of her father's limbs and* looked appeal
ingly at the big d-puty, and that sealed
all chance of further hostilities.
It was decided to place Merrick under
arrest for his assault on De^an, but again
the little on-s pleadings >aved the lather,
and he was allowed to go Iree, with a
warning never to attempt such a proceed
ing again.

CHARTER-MAKING
WILL GO SLOWLY
May Take One Year to
Prepare the Instru
ment.
Will Take Some Time to Select
the Committee of One
Hundred.
VIEWS OF F. W. DOHKMANN.
He Prepared the Resolutions Which
Were Adoptei by the Charter
Association Friday.
Mayor-elect Phelan may not name the
committee of 100 citizens to take the pre
liminary steps toward procuring a new
charter for San Francisco for some time.
The probability is that he will ask several
gentlemen to assist him in making up the
committee. Tne main purpose in view is
to have the committee as representative as
possible of all ciasses in the community.
This is the idea held by the Merchants'
Association and by the Citizens' Charter
Association, both of which organizations
nave expressed themselves clearly on that
point. These are the facts as they are
narrated by leading merchants.
F. W. Dohrmann, who introduced the
resolutions at the meeting of the Citizens'
Charter Association Friday night which
were adopted, and so furnished a basis for
future work, saia yesterday that he was
equaily surprised and gratified that the
meeting had adopted the resolutions so
readily. This was indicative of real
desire to provide the City with some kind
of a charter, the best kind that can be
devised, in lieu of the present tattered and
dilapidated consolidation act.
"I think," said Mr. Dohrmann lasteven
ing, "that the steps to be taken
will be deliberate, as the measures
to be considered are very important and
we cannot safely make haste. I have not
ta.ked with Mr. Phe an since the meeting
of Friday night, and so do not know what
his ideas are. He was completely sur
prised when tbe resolutions were presented
and adopted Friday night.
"The idea of inviting all the people to
take part in the making of the charter
was favored by the Merchants' Associa
tion. There is no othfer way to provide
an instrument that will meet with popu
lar approval and that can be adopted on
any other plan. The provision for alter
native propositions would enable the peo
ple, there be ng different opinions con
cerning any particular measure, to select
that which they prefer.
"There should be. in my opinion, a
special election for freeholders during the
next fiscal year. It may take one year to
prepare the charter. There must be sub
committees of the committee of one hun
dr- d to consider the different branches of
the general subject, and they may have to
hold many meetings and probably wilJ.
It will not do to prolong the considera
tion of the charter long enough to let the
interest die out, nor wij it do to make to
much haste. Ihe committee of one hun
dred will enter upon the consideration of
tbe charter without being hampered in
any way â that is, they will begin from the
levi nning."
The same general views were expressed
by othsr gentlemen who favor the charier
â nil who were pleased to find those who
openly opt osea the charter that has just
been rejected coming iorward with assur
ances, as they did at the meeting Friday
night, that they lavor a new charter. The
resolutions which were adopted by the
meeting were drawn by Mr. Dohrmann, by
whom they were offered.

THE isolated patter of one pair of Chinese baby feet in a noisome "China alley" j
a few years ago would have caused a flutter. Almond eyes,.olive skin, jaunty I
cap, rustline silken garments, snowy white little shoes, a braided "pigtail" I
which oscillated like a pendulum, long fingernails â and there was the little;
pagan w o pioneered a long array of similarly attired other little pa ans
out from Chinese hovels into the sunshine and fearless freedom in the open air.
A native-born citizen, the American eagle seemed not a whi t proud of him; a
native son, California was ready to repudiate him. Now the patter of one pair of feet
is succeeded by the sound of legions. In Chinatown's dirty purlieus an infantile army
has been reared. Two years ago the school census takers found 1500 Chinese children
of school age. There are not less than 2000 native sons and daughters in San Fran
cisco's Chinatown, in whose veins Chinese blood flows, and who are lawful heirs of
American citizenship. A small army of Mongols is marching leisurely along the dusty
highway of time toward the ultimate and surebailot-box.
This phase of the Chinese question does not appear to have been fully compre- !
bended. But not later than the year 1920, at the present birth rate in Chinatown and j
supposing average conditions regarding mortality to < btain, it is as clear as anythin â  j
. can be that something like 2500 Chinese native-born citizens, now mostly young chil- j
' dren, will be entitled to the ballot in San Francisco alone. Sacramento, Stockton, l
Los Angeles, San Jose, and in fact nearly all communities in California, liave also i
their native-born Mongolian babies who are on their way to citizenship. Not le:-s ]
than 4000 native-born Chinese voters will be in the field of politics in 1920 in Caii- !
forniaâ enough with an alliance with some large political party and with a united
front to carry a State election; enough to settle a Presidential election if California :
â¢should be the pivotal State, conceding that the strength of parties should be some
what neariy divided.
Surely thÂ« student of political History must see something curious in this not very <
remote contingpney. Less than one-quarter of one century may see dragon flags fly- i
ing from the roofs of Chinese josshouses, from the tops of buildings in which fan-tan j
games aoide, and from scores of buildings reeking with nlth and "smelling to heaven," !
in celebration of the election of the candidate of the Chinese for Governor or even for
President of the United States of America, or Congressman, or Mayor, or Supervisor, i
There may even come a time when bonfires will bum in Chinatown and Chinese gongs \
and other alleged musical instruments be sounded to catch the Mongolian vote, and
â wagons cany up and down the steep slopes advice to Chinese-Americans to vote for
Ah Jow or Tom Lee for Sheriff or Mayor or some other equally important office.
Chinese, it is well known, have strong family attachments. The head of a family \
directs ali the others, who obey him implicitly. Unquestioning obedience gives the i
ideal conditions required for henchmen of a political boss. â¢ Another queer feature
â¢ngnfted upon the American political system in San Francisco will be the influence !
of aged Chinese, who have no votes themselves, but who will have power to insure
how numbers of votes will be cast. The Chinese patriarchs, with goat-like beards.
will be "bosses" of the most approved sort. This is certain enough.
The Chinese children are receiving enougn education to enable them to vote when
the time comes. There are now hundreds of them who can read and write English j
fluently. In addition to the Chinese public school on Clay street there are mission !
â¢ schools where English is taught. The Clay-street Chinese public school lias three
classes of Chinese boys and girls, with a total attendance of about eighty-five chil
dren, who are reading and writing Eng'ish every day.
The Chinese mission schools and the approximate attendance at each are about as
follows: Occidental Mission at 911 Stockton street, 38, of whom 29 are boys and 9 girls; '
Lcomis Memorial School, 911 Stockton street, 40; Baptist school at the corner of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1896.
Waverly place and Sacramento street, 30; Methodist school at
916 Washington street, between Powell and Stockton, 37.
Here is the beginning and here are 220 Chinese children who
can already read and write English. The Chinese are taking
care w:th the education of their children as do other races. The
little boys and girls who study English during the forenoon and
the early afternoon occupy themselves duriner the later hours of
the day learning to read and write Chinese at several schools, in
which teachers brought from China preside. The schools of
this sort are all located in Chinatown, being as follows* : Kearny
and Washington streets. 12 pupils; 765 Clay street, 16 pnpils;
738 Jacsson street, 20 pupils; Brenham place and Washington
stieet, 8 pupils; Clay and Duront streets, 18 pu iis; Waver y
place, between Wasbingtpn and Clay streets, 14 pupils.
There are comparatively few Chinese girls in the schools.
There are two reasons lor this. The leading reason is that their
parents are afraid that if their girls leave home they will be
kidnaped and held for ransom by other Chinese. The other
reason is that Chinese consider women inferior. There are
grotesque and striking possibilities in the chances of abduction.
A Chinese woman of voting age is a marketable commodity.
Her price varies according to her beauty. The more beautiful
she is the more she is in danger of a violent and nivo.un
tary chance of abode through the agencj' ot the highbinders.
The possili ity of a Chinese woman in her capacity of candi
date for member of the Board of E iucation â for the education
of Chinese children will grow in importance in proportion io
the increase in their political power â visiting the polis on elec
tion day and being abducted may exist.
it has been as umed, for the purpose of presenting the full
strength of the future Chinese "push" in this City, that the
Chinese might vote solidly, all on one side of a given question.
Tnisdoes not fail to inciude knowledge and recognition of the
bitter hostility between Sam Yups and See Yups and their
possible outbreaks at the polls should there be opposing candi
dates, white or Chinese, both catering to the Chinese vote. Bui
lets would fly very likely in such a contingency, and that
imperium in imperio, Chinatown, would have old troubles in
tensified by an election.
But there are questions upon which the Chinese vote may
be solid. Let it be borne in mind that the more Chinese there
are in San Francisco the more trade there is for Chinese mer
chants; the more blackmail money for highbinders; the more
lees and importance and meruLers for the various companies;
the greater the influence of the Chinese politically^ Still front
ing California, on the Pacific, are millions of Chinese persons
who would like to come to the United States to ea-n money.
The local Chinese vote, a little more than twenty years hence,
may help them to come.
In the Chinese public school on Clay street and in the mission
schools <vhere Chinese children arf. taught the books used are '.he
California State text series. The Chiuese children, according
to competent testimony, learn rapidly. Their copybooks look
fully a-i well as those of white children in the most favored
school. They sit at desks like other children. Some of them,
esuecially the children of christianized Chinese parents, dress
as Americans. The little girls braid their hair and tie ribbons
to it like other li tie girls. They giggle behind their books
and act not one whit different from other children in school.
ThÂ«jy sing songs in both English and Chine-e and find no in
superable difficulty in adopting the diatonic musical scale ot
civilization. Nor has Chinese music deprived them of anaj
precationof civilized melodies.
They are just as mischievous as other children. The boys
delight in climbing upon the desks and making a noise when
the teacher is absent. They puli the girls' hair and tyrannize
and tease, it is when recess comes and they play in their own
way that the boys show their marked racial diverceiices from
the youthful Caucasian. They are often seen fencing with long
sticks alter the alleged sanguinary fashion of the actors in pre
posterous Chinese dramas. With abbreviated "pigtails" sway
ing they seek sheltered nooks to p ay shut le-cock, kicking the
sduttle-cock into the air with their heels. Will some distan
successor of Mayor-elect Pbrlan comme:Â»d himself io voters by
trotting up and down Brenham place and kickin_ up bis heel
in a crack exhibi ion of sbutue-cuck playing?
The coming male voters of Cninatown are different in out
ward appearance from tue Chinese chi.dren as they were ob
strved in San Francisco even so recently as ten years ago. They
are not more or less gorgeous in spangles, nor more or less radi-
ant as to clothes, nor longer or more abbreviated as to pigtail. The change is in their
eyes and manner. The native boy Chinese resident of San Francisco has added to
the habitual careful watchfulness and curiosity of all Chinese the habits of the Amer
ican boy in some degree. The developments of civilization, as manifested by cable
cars, telephones and all other modern appliances, have brightened his faculties, and
contact with white children has tinged his life. Auy observer must have noticed that
there has been a change mentally.
The Chinese Â£irls are known less. At 12 or 13 they may be married and mothers
at 14. The feet of the poor are pinched by their parents, not for gentility, but that the
eirls may be eot rid of easily when they have reached what the Chinese coasider
the marriageable a-e. There have always been comparatively few Chinese women in
San Francisco, and the opportunities offered to a Chinese father to get rid of his super
fluous girls are exceptionally good in this town, and if ths girl is goc iking she
brings a sum of money which makes her a source of profit.
The young mothers, girls of 14 or evÂ«sn younger, are not seen in public. The fact
that they are married does not exempt them from the danger of be _ : kidnaped.
Then, again, the Chinese husbands are extremely jealous and keep their jrdung wives
housed as much as possible. While there have been many adult Chi tjo who have
departed for China never to return, and while, therefore, Chinatov n has many
unoccupied stores and dwellings which were formerly filled.it is not s-,.fe to assume
that Chinatown is doomed ultimately to disappear. In fact, quite iba contrary
appears probable.
The children who are bora in San Francisco have no natural attachment for
China, which they have never seen and which has less of freedom and of opportunity
than the United States for them. There is little reason to suppose that they will
seek China when their parents voluntarily have chosen San Francisco in which to
rear their families. They will live in San Francisco. The rate of increase is very
rapid. The babies are taking the places of the adults who have gona tc China to
remain.
Everywhere throughout the length and breadth of Chinatown i* heard ihe
laughter and chattering of Chinese children. They seem to spring up like Qiusbrooms
over night. Being small they do not compel their parents to enlarge their tenements,
which are as small as possible under the circumstances. It is only a very few veara
since Chinese raised families as freely in this City and the effect of an increasing' pop
ulation is not felt appreciably because of the extreme present juvenility ol the addi
tions.
There are other points of interest concerning the coming Chinese voters. While
they are learning to read and write they remain pagans to a great degree.
"It is not right," said an English speaking young Chinaman t<- a lady re
cently, "that the Chinese in San Francisco should have to obey American taw*. The
Chinese laws are enough."
Chinatown will have the numerical strength to cause itself to be rep ;nted in
some future Board of Supervisors of the City of San Francisco; very like by a Su
pervisor who shall enter the chamber of the board attired like a Chinese merchant
during the Chinese New Year's festivities. Seated between two sober-sui I Ameri
can citizens, who represent Caucasian wards, he may wave his fan and rua hi? Ori
ental finery and legislate. Or it may oe that Ab Sing, overcoming th national
prejudices of his parents in the matter of dress, may eat rice with chopst Oka at
Mayor's banquet, wearing a claw-hammer coat and white tie.
Then and there may arise a din of Chinese music, so called, as a gracic
to the growing political influence and importance of Ah Sing. Perhaps roast pig
may smoke, cooked in the Chinese style, and punks may fragrantly fume, ar.d the
Chinese supervisor, rising to respond to the toast of the evening, shall pul/ cut with,
the manu-cript of his remarks a package of Chinese prayer papers, and so the
picture become compete.p ete. Perhaps he will wave his fan and "eat preserved ginger and
teach the Mayor how they kowtow in Peking. Then shall the son of the moon and
the ?un and the stars sit him down and think of the New Zealander on the ruias of
London bridge of whom Macaulay wrote.

A Life Was at Stake in the Most Exciting Game of Freeze-Out Ever Played
"No, I don't play poker any more," said
a big Westerner, who came into an up
town clubhouse the other night with some
friends who had been showinc Jjim the
town. He spoke rather seriously, al
though he had been chatting and laugh
ing in a loud, breezy way until the very
moment when somebody suggested a little
game of draw as an appropriate wind-up
of the night's diversion.
"Why, how is that?" exclaimed one of
his friends. ''You used to play a stiff
game. You haven't sworn off, have you?"
"Nâ no," said the Westerner, still seri
ous. "I have not sworn off, but there is
no excitement in the game for me now.
The last game I played was too exciting."
The thrilling story thereof, us told in
the New YorK Sun, runs as follows:
"It was v dozen years ago, when I was a
tenderfoot, with the usual allowance of
freshness, t.nd ignorance of frontier perils.
We u?ed vo call it brash ness, and I was
certainly brash. I roamed around the
country rather for the better part of a
year, with a rcore or less vague purpose
of settling somewhere, but not caring
much where. I had money enough to
Btart with, whenever I snould find an
opening to suit me, but I was not in a
hurry, and was enjoying the freedom and
adventurous life of me plains as only a
youngstercan wlio is not obiijied to put up
with the hardships, but looks on them as
mere incidents.
"I was well down toward New Mexico
when there was a rumor of Indian troub
les, and 1 heard that a company of United
States troops were on the march toward
one of the principal villages where the
redskins were particularly sullen. 1 iad
been out hunting for a week with a couple
of fellows I had met in one of the towns,
when we got the news from a stranger
who came into our camp late at night and
asked for supper. He admitted when we
questioned him â not too clo-ely,for inquis
itiveness is at a large discount on the
plains, but casuallyâ that he was a scout
in the Government employ and was on
his way to join this company.
â¢ " 'There's likely to be some pretty warm
work,' he said wlien we asked a little
more, 'Jor if the red devils are not on the
warpath now they will be in a day or two,
and you fellows will do a smart trick if
you turn back.'
"Turning back, however, didn't seem
very attractive to me when there was so
much excitement ahead. I promptly re
marked that 1 thought I would go on with
the scout and offer my services to ihe cap
tain in command. I told you I was pretty
brash at the time, and I bad no knowledge
The Costly Havoc of the Gypsy Moth
L?opold Trouvelot's experiments with
moths prove ra;her expensive for the
State of Slassachusetts. The apparently
insignificant fact or a moth's escaping
irom bis laboratory near Maiden several
years ago has resulted in a cost to the
commonwealth of that State of more than
$500,000, while it is probable that about
$200,000 additional will have to be ex
pended. The ravages of the gypsy moth
and the effort* made to stop it mark one
of the most exasperating problems with
which the scientists and entomologists of
any State in the Union have ever had to
contend.
The Cornmissio'ners of the State Agri
cultural Department having this matter
in charge are now sending oui the reports,
and are rejoiced to announce that they
have reason to believe that the pest is at
last under control.
In 1868 Gienwood, in Medford, was tbe
home of a distinguished French artist,
naturalist and astronomer named Leopold
Trouvelot. Trouvelot at that time was
deeply interested in experimenting alon â 
the lino of silk culture. In the latter part
of the year he imported from Europe some
insects' eggs, and among them were some
of the dreaded ''gypsy moth," as com
monly called, but scientifically termed
Portbetria dispar. This moth in Europe
had done incalculable damage to fruit and
forest trees.
rHEELMKILLED BY THE MOTH.
One morning MonsieurTrouvelot, while
at work in an upper room of his home,
at 27 Myrtle street, was called away for a
moment and did not think to pull down
the shutters. A stray puff of wind blew
some of these moth eggs from the
table and into the yard. Trouvelot, on
discovering what had happened, was
greatly frightened, for the fecudity of this
species of moth is almost incredible. He
made diligent examination and took
much precaution to spray the trees near
his home with poisonous compounds. No
particular attention was paid by the pub
lic to his announcement of the accident.
Within a very few years the gypsy moth
had become so numerous about Medford
that it threatened to destroy every vestige
of vegetation. People were fighting it
and every summer marveling at tbe as
tonishing myriads of caterpillars. They
covered trees, fences, grasses and side
walks. For years owners of land fought
the pest as they could, but all
the while it kept spreading, and
of military affairs. My notion was that
the captain would oe glad of a recruit, or,
at least, that he would make no objection
to my going with him.
"I noticed that the scout looked at me a
little curiously, but he evidently thought
it was not his business to educate tender
feet, and he only grunted. My two com
panions were as fresh as I was, and we
told the scout we would go along if he had
no objection.
" 'lt's a free country, and I reckon you
can travel wherever you like,' he said,
with a grin that 1 understood better after
ward.
"We started before dawn, and had some
thirty odd miles to go to strike tbe trail
where the company was expected to camp
that night. Tnere were still some ten
miles to go when, as we were rounding a
smalJ hill, the scout suddenly leaped
from his horse and called to us to do the
same.
"He had seen Indians, and, to cut it
short, we camped that night in a place
where the scout said that four men could
hold out for a while, even against the hun
dred or so in the party that had surround
ed us. It was a certainty, though, that we
would all lose our scalps unless help came,
for there was no water to be ha*i, and the
Indians knew it and made themselves
comfortable just out of range of our
rifles. The scjut didn't say much for a
long time, but we could see that he was
thinking as hard as any of us, and we
were all pretty busy at ie There didn't
seem to be anything to suggest, or at least
there was nothing that I could think of
exceptine to make a dash and try to
break through. Nobody said anything in
reply when I spoke of that, and the -scout
gave me a look of disgust that made me
anery enough, but shut me up all the
| same. Finally he said: '"It's just this
| Way. These devils have caught us and
they know it. They won't make a rush
for they know we will shoot, and an In
dian wiil never risk being shot if he can
get his man without. We can't fight our
way out. There's too many of 'em. And
we can't stay here any longer than we
] can live without water.'
"I asked him if the captain wouldn't
make a search fur him, and he said the
captain didn't know he was coming.
'He's on his way south,' he said, 'and the
trail he is ou is ten miles to the east of us.
There's only one thing that I see, and
that means certain death for somebody, I
reckon. It's certain death for all of us,
though, if something ain't done.' We
asked him what it was, and he eaid:
" 'If one man can make his way south- 1
Iby 1889 dozens of towns in the
; wooded country within a radius of twenty
i miles of Boston were interested in the
| question of what was to be done with the
i "caterpillars." In the summer seasons
: orchards in a single night would be
j stripped of every leal; currant bushes
i wuuid be laid as bare as by fire, and even
the native pine woods suffered as well,
i The moth was becoming a menace not
j only to Eastern Massachusetts but to the
| State and to other Slates.
From meetings of tbe selectmen of the
towns the agitation spreau to the Assem
bly of 'he commonwealth, and in Decem
| ber, ISB9, Governor Brackett referred to it
lin a message to tbe Legislature. Early in
i IS9O, as the result of a law passed on the
j subject, a board of commissioners
| was set at work making investiga
tions regarding the extent of terri
tory infested by the moth. It was
ascertained that this included fifty square
miles at least. Tbe board employed
scientists and entomologists, and these in
turn proceeded to arrange the methods of
fighting the moth. The first step was the
i spraying of the trees with paris green.
! The work was applied in tbe widest range
I at Me. ford. Maiden, Arlington, Chelsea
and Everett. It required some time for
the commissioners to discover the full ex
tent of the territory infested with the
moths, but at last it was seen that towns
as far distant from Boston as sixty miles
were tormented.
The first year of the operation of this
law made it plain that the scientists were
accomplishing something. The region
which the men treated did not suffer
ereatly the tallowing year. In the prose
cution of the work of moth destruc
tion in the last six years the commis
sioners have made many important dis
coveries that are extremely valuable in a
scientific and agricultural way. Many
valuable machines have been invented 'for
use in this particular work. Several in
genious compounds have been prepared
which have proved most effective.
The wort of fighting this pest has been
tremendous in its demai.d for ingenuity,
patience and determination.' Hundreds
of acres have been gone over foot by foot;
brush land has been burned over for the
purpose of destroying eggs O r ester
pillars; even stone walls have had
to be thoroughly Bprayed. To one
who had been in this State in 1880

east tar enough, so that the noise of *the
firing will reach the company, the captain
will send a searching party. It all de
dends on how far the man guts before he
is killed. If we all ride oat we will all be
killed. If one man goes the others may
stand a chance.'
'â We all looked at one another in silence
for a good while. My biood ran cold at
and viewed a portion of the locality in
question tue attempt to exterminate
the moth or prevent its getting into other
parts of the country would have seemed
about as likely of success as tbe hunt
through a haystack for a lost needle. Suc

setts citizens are rejoicea. To show what

Smallest of Their Kind in Town
A Church
That Is Modest and
Very Rich
The Smallest House of Worship
in the Gty Belongs to
the Wealthiest Con
gregation
The smallest church in this City in
probably the BweJenborgian, on Lyon
street, near Washington, though the little
church of St. Mary the Virgin, at Steiner
and Union streets, presses it very close.
Comparing roughly the exteriors of the
two churches one would say at once that
the Sweden borgian edifice was much
smaller than the Episcopal structure, but
upon closer inspection one finds that the
difference between the two is very smail.
The Swedenborgian church is designedly
modest, even humble, in its exterior, so it
looks much smaller than it really is, But
there are costly treasures Â©f both art and
architecture within, and, curiously
enough, this smallest church in the City
gives shelter to what is probably the rich
est congregation in the City. At all
events, there are no questicnÃ of church
debt for this coneregat.on to puzzle over,
and the modest, humble, meek little brick
structure cost more money to build and
furnish and enjoys a more expensive site
than a far more pretentious church edifice
built by many a poorer congregation.
It is called the Church oi the New Jeru
salem No. 2, being the second Sweden
borgian church in this City, and in
teriorily it is one of the architectural
beauties of tbe City. It was designed
chiefly by the late A. Pago Brown, and
there are some rare paintings and fur
nishings within. All about the little
place is very quaint and odd, even strange
for a church, but very artistic as well, and
quite unconventional.
Its rival in point of smallness, the Epis
copal church at Steiner and Union streets,
hus been known as Frank Pixley's church,
bnt, in fact, the late editor did very little
for the church, though quite recently his
widow has donated the land.

Business on a Tiny
Bit of Land
Smallest Piece of Improved Real
Estate on Sacramento
Street, Just East of
Kearny
The smallest piece of improved real-es
tate in San Francisco has a frontage of 6
feet 8 inches on the north side of Sacra
mento street, a few doors east of Kearny.
For a piece of business property in the
heart of the City this is as queer a little
place as one could imagine. The lot ad
joining it to tbe west has a frontage of 13
feet 4 incurs, while the lot on the east,
which belongs to Michael Frank Michael,
has a frontage of 44 feet and 2 inches.
This 6 foot 8 inch strip is the property of
Mr?. Mary A. Gibbons, an Alameda lady.
It has a depth of 59 feet & inches, and
every inch of bof*h depth and width is
fully utilized.
There is a single-story, weather-boarded,
blue-painted frame structure on the
premises,* which brings quite a fancy
rental, everything considered, for it is oc
cupied by two different tirius and as many
businesses. C. L. Giiler makes and sells
metal dies, signs and letters here, while
the firm of Kocb & Harney, job printers,
also do a considerable trade in this tiny
structure.
The place has a show-window, of course,
and a front door, which gives ingress and
egress to the proprietors and their em
ployes, but should a fat man seek to enter
that door he would have to turn sideways.
This is undoubtedly the very smallest
piece of improved rtialty in San Francisco,
and aside from this is one of the old
landmarks of that quarter of the City.
None of the stores in that neighborhood
are very large, but, considering the value
of the improvements, no other property
in that block pays as good an income on
the investment.
The ex-Empress Eugenic, who is still

Artificial Rain in a Railway Car
Artificial rain-making and the creation
of breezes while traveling at the rate of a
mile a minute in a railway car constitutes
tbe latest triumph of inventive genius.
The man who has conceived the appa
ratus by means of which these remarkable
results can be brought about is E. H. R.
Green, the general manager of the Texas
Midland Railroad. Mr. Green labors un
der the disadvantage, so many people
would believe, of being born with a s.lver
spoon in his mouth, for he is the son
of Hetty Green, the richest woman in
America.
Mr. Green's clever idea has made it pos
sible for a person to travel in the warmest
day of summer without suffering in the
least from those twin evils of railroad
journeys, dust 'and heat. The practica
bility of the idea has been clearly shown
by thorough trial, and within the past
week several cars equipped with the in
vention have been daily runniug on the
Texas Midiand Railroad. It has been be
lieved that such a thing as constructing o
practically dustproof car was out of the
question. The new idea stows again that

The smallest residence in San Francisco
is, of course, located in Chinatown. It is
not, however, at the end of a dark alley in
a damp cellar. In many of these are some
very diminutive roosting places, out they
are elegant homes and flats compared to
Wong Seek's private residence on the cor
ner of Waverly place and Clay street.
Wong's home is about as big as bis skin
â a trifle larger, of course, to allow for his
wooden shoes that go to bed with him,
but tbe difference is not material. Wong's
home is a box nailed to a brick wall over
the fruitstand where Wong makes a living
that would not keep a white baby fat.
Directly opposite â that is to say, on the
southeast corner of Waveriy place and
Clay streetâ there is another Chinama:.
who has a residence similar to that of
Wong. But his is larger than Wong's â
whether owing to larger wooden shoes or
to just what is not known. But it meas
ures fully a foot more in length and ia an.
inch or so more in thickness.
The dimensions of Wong's private resi
dence â he lives in it ail by himself â are 5
feet in length, 2 feel in width, with a ceil
ing height of 3 feet clear of the gas fixtures.
For a pillow Wong has a 90-cent oil-stove,
and in the morning he cooks his break
fast on his pillow. He uses a rope-ladder
to get into his home, and when he has
tucked himself in for the night he pulls
up his ladder and is safe.
' Wong is saving his money and will some
day take the steamer for China and cart
off 200 or 300 American gold dollars to the
slums of Hongkong, where he will live
like a prince.

[ had to decide who should go, and I sup
posed, of course, that we would draw lots,
but one of the men spoke up unexpectedly :
" 'Whoever goes,' he said, 'doesn't want
to start lor some hours. The scout says
just after daybreak is the best time. What
is the matter of settling tola thing with
poker? We can play freeze-out, and three
games will settle it, the winuer dropping
out each time.'
"The proposition caught me. You
know I used to pride myself on my poker.
After a little hesitation the others agreed.
The man who proposed it had the cards
and we counted out 600 coffee beans for
chips and began playing on a blanket
folded and laid on the ground. You would
think the details of a game like that would
fix themselves in the memory so tuat I
would be able to tell you every hand I
held and every bet I made, wouldn't you?
Well, I can't. In fact I can't tell any
thing about the first game excepting that
1 was the first man to lose all his chips. I
had played often enough for what I
thought were high stakes, but the thought
that I was playing for my life rattled me
completely, and I really believe I bet at
random. Whatever I did I lost, and the
man who had proposed the game won out.
He was shot in a gambling-house three
months later â had an extra ace in his
sleeve, I believe, or something like that.
"The next freeze-out, between three of
us, was a comparatively short one. It did
not take more than twenty minutes for
the scout to eather in all the chips, but
short as it was I managed to get myself
together a little, though I was still full of
the thought of the value of the stakesâ a
thing which, I have noticed, always inter*
feres with my piay. When I consider the
Y,aiue of a chip it always influences my
betting one way or the other, even though
1 try not to allow it to do so, and in this
case I said to myself that each bean repre
sented the one hundred and fiftieth part
of my life. In other words I was gambling
away months and years instead of money.
"When the third game began, however,
I pulled myself together with a most tre
mendous effort and really became as cool
as I ever had been before at a game of
cards. The man I played against this
time was a young Englishman whom I
bad grown to esteem highly in the short
time I had known him. He was a gentle
man clear through and as cheery and com
panionable a man as I ever met. His peo
ple at home never heard this story and I
hope they never will. They know that he
was killed by the Indians and that he was
on a hunting trip, hut they never heard of
his last game of cards, nor of the way he
nothing is impossible and that modern
inventive genius can accomplish almost
anything.
The modus operandi of Mr. Green's con
trivance is simple and the mechanism free
irom complications. Between the windows
in the car is a ventilator so arranged as to
be directly, or almost directly, beside tbe
passenger. This ventilator is covered with
a screen of exceeding fineness, both inside
and out, and there is an arrangement so
constructed that at the will of the passen
ger a fine spray of water plays between
tbe two screens. This water has as its
source a supply contained in a tank lo
cated beneath the car and between the
trucks. It is forced upward by means of
compressed air.
It may readily be seen that the screen
will prevent the entrance of cinders and
like particles which have been both a
menace and a discomfort to the traveler
on tbe railway. At the same time the
water, playing between the screens, catches
each particle of dust, washes it away,
thus keeping the air as it enters the car as
fresh and clean as that in the pine woods
at break of day. The car will be, so far
as air is concerned, in as good a condition
when traveling through the alkali desert
as when passing through a country which
blossoms like the rose.
VIEW OF THE DUST-PROOF CAR.
Each of the ventilators is three feet long
and remains open constantly. It is the
spraying of the water which the passenger
is able to regulate. With this new idea in
operation it is wholly unnecessary to open
the windows of tbe car at all, as the ven
tilators cause a constant change of air.
As a matter of fact tbe air in the car ia
rendered much purer by means of Mr.
Green's invention than it would be if it
found entrance through the windows.
As severe a test as it is possible to make
was applied to a car equipped with the new
invention a f.w days ago. and the result
is surprising. Fully forty men took pass
age in this car on the trip referted to.
The windows were locked and the ventil
ators put in perfect condition. The spray
of water was turned on, and the current
moved steadily between tbe screens of
each ventilator. Every passenger was a
smoker, and each one lit a ciuar. The

rode to his death. We had each 300 bean
and half a dozen hands were dea.t
before either of us got cards to bet
on. Then on my deal I caught three
deuces and made it fifty to play-
He looked at his cards and raised
me fifty, which I covered. He drew
one card and let it lij without looking at
it, while he watched ma. I saw him look
ing, cf course, and I am more glad than
I am of almost any thine else I ever did in
an almost useless life to think that I
made the worst play 1 ever saw made. I
liked the man well, as I said, and some
impulsetbat I couldn't understand then,
and can't explain now, told me to leave
the thing to chance, and to give him a
little the better chance. I had played
with him before, and I was certain that he
had not come back at me the way he did
on two pair. He wa3 drawing to a flush,
and somehow I felt that he had tilled it.
Of course I should have drawn to the
strength of my hand, bat I didn't I
drew one card only, holding up an eight
spot to my deuces, and I shoved all mv
"beans into the pot without looking at my
draw.
"He gave me one look, in which I read
a perfect appreciation of what I had done,
and without a word, and without lifting
his fifth card he pushed his chips forward.
Then my nerve cave out. I grew as white
as death, I know, though no one ever told
me so, and I actually could not lift my
cards. His nerve never shook, though,
apparently, and he tnrned his fifth card
over as be laid it on the blanket. They
were ail clubs. He looked at me, and I
swear I saw regret in his eyes. I tell you
he was a man. Tien I managed to turn
my hand over. I had drawn the other
eight." Â«â¢â¢
The Westerner stopped. He drained his ||
glass and then said:
"Waiter, bring another bottle and bring
me some whisky besides. This stuff
doesn't co to the right spot." Then, after
he had had his drink, he said:
"You don't wonder, do yon, that I don't
play poker any more ?"
"No," said his hearers, "but finish the
story."
â¢'Oh ! there isn't much more to it. At
least that is the end of it, as I think about
it. The Englishman shook hands with us
all and rode away. We watched him
until he fell, and he must have gone fully
three miles. A good many Indians fell
before he did, for he was a clever shot.
Later in the day the company came to our
rescue, and I am glad to say a good many
more Indians paid for his death with their
own."
volume of cigar smoke wa3 enormous, and
yet by means of the ventilating apparatus
and the sprays of water tbe air in the car
remained agreeable from first to last.
While it is very difficult to indicate by
means of illustration an accurate concep
tion of Mr. Green's invention, the accom
panying picture, which is drawn from a
photograph taken especially for the pur
pose of rendering this article clear and ex
plicit, shows the position of the ventilator
in the car and gives something of an idea
ot its construction. The car in which this
invention is placed is a palace one, luxuri
ously fitted up. The ventilator give.s the
impression of being merely ornamental
work until closely inspected. On the out
side of the car nothing is observable.
At the bottom of the panels in tbe inte
rior of the car between each window is a
small glass knob. The knob, however, is
sunk in the woodwork so that it is not
noticeable unless one looks for it. It en
ables the traveler to have breezes at his
pleasure. By slightly turning this knob
the little doors or deflectors on the outside
of the car are opened and in the direction
in which tbe car is going, just the reverse
of the method observed in the elevated
railway trains, which prevents the cinders
sifting into the car and at tbe same time
permits ventilation.
Thus it will be seen that the air in plen
tiful quantity is admitted from the out
side. On us admission it encounters the
first screen. Then It must sitt through
the spray of Alter that comes an
other screen, and thus it is made plain
that the air of necessity must be pure By
thÂ« time it reaches the breathing appara
tus of the thoroughly comfortable passen
ger. It might be thought that it would
be a matter of difficulty to secure a suffi
cient supply of water, but as the only way
in which that supply is reduced is by
evaporation, the same water being used
over and over again, it may readily ho
M'en that the question of sufficient suj 1
ia not a difficult one to answer. 3
Inasmuch as the success of the invention
bus been Instantaneous it may be stated
; with confidence that it is only a question
ol time when the apparatus will be adopted
by all railroads. It certainly solves thÂ«
problem with which railroad men hayÂ«
been struggling lor many years,ARTS AID TO CIVILISATION
By .Horace S. Platt
The only standard of beauty is truth, not distorted or modified, but as visible
to the soul of the artist It is nature freed from the trammels of time or circum
stance.
' "Art must imitate nature," says Tame, "and when it ceases to do this it de
clines." But in initating nature the artist's aim must be not to photograph, but
to make manifest what is to him the predominating character, the essential con
dition of biine la the object. The faculty of perceiving nnd expressing this essen
tial condtion is artistic genius.
In this endetvor to express this principal quality the artist arrives at the
Ideal, that is, te removes the obstacles that fate or fortune, environment or cir
cumstance. h*s placed in nature's path and gives it a chance to perfect itself on
the lines of tU first Intention. This development is bcp.u'.iiul. because it is
natural, and you know that it is natural because it is true.
The ideal is the expression of what the artist feels lie sees. The true artist
feels that be sees the perfect form through the imperfections that clog nature, as
Praxiteles saw the perfect fipure of Venus sleeping within the rough-hewn block
of marble The aim of art is to cut away these imperfections and to strive for the
uerfect, vhicn must be the beautiful. A work of art must be, therefore, us Tame
â ays, "a representation of an object more perfectly than it is found in nature."
It is .-0u1.e.-s nature plus soulful man evoived into the ideal.
Rusicin save that the living power in all the real schools of art is the love of
"nature ; that art followed as such and for its own sake, irrespective of the inter
pretations of nature, is destructive of whatever is best and noblest in humanity,
but that so far s,s It la devoted to the record or interpretation of nature it' is
helpiul and ennobling- Art culture, therefore, implies not only appreciation of
the beautiful, but love of nature. It stimulates us to study God's handiwork, to
distinguish the lines of beauty as God made them before man unmade them. It
reveals to us tbe intelligence that guided creation, the skill that worked out
creation, the beauty that thu> found expression. It discovers to us that nature
is perfect, because to have changed it would have made it imperfect. To idealize
nature is not to change nature. The artist does not himself improve nature by
idealizing it. He simply obeys the inspiration of nature and depicts her per
fected in passing through the crucible of his soul. The artist in doing this works
as nature wills.
Love of beauty is therefore love of nature, and love of nature is -ove of God.
By love of God I do not necessarily mean religion as commonly understood. I
mean the worship and adoration the soul offers up to the Supreme Artist who
painted the skies and necked them not with a cloud that marred their beauty,
nor spangled them with s'ars but to add to the splendid effect of darkness liÂ»jht
bepierced, who painted the /alleys green and cast n haze over rugged mountain
sides, who varied the dullness of plains with the sheen of running waters, und
painted o'er the green of spring with the gold of fall, that man might not tire
of monotony, and then made man in His own image.
The most beautiful form of nature is therefore the human form divine, and
art was greatest when the human figure rather than human thought occupied
most its attention.
Ruskin says that "all progresirve art hitherto has been religious art," and
that "art was never employed on a great scale except In the service of religion."
I do not altogether agree with him. Religion may have furnished the occasion
for, the opportunity of ait's greatest efforts, but it was not of itself the inspiration
of the highest art known in history.
In ancient Greece art climbed nearest heaven and brought the gods to
earth. It was essentially human.' Praxiteles in carving his Venus sought to deify
humanity by producing a perfect human form, to carve hi marble bis ideal of
( woman, if woman was divine, to give to man a type of beauty nature would have
produced if, in creating woman, it had not been chained down by mortality. It
was not divinity but humanity that his artistic soul worshiped. . .
In those days man's best efforts were spent in cultivating health and strength
. and grace and beauty of form, and athletic skill. Greatest in Greece was he who
came off victor at the Olympian games and stave his name to the coming years-
Whether Apelles painted beauty of face or depicted on canvas the mysteries of
religious worship we knew not. Sculpture alone tells of Grecian art, and It found
> best expression in that which most interested the people of that time. The artists
of that age did as artists of every age must do. they filled mind ana heart with
the ideas and sentiments of their age. Hence their master idea was "the living,
healthy, energetic, active human body, endowed with every athletic and animal
aptitude." It was their delight to carve from stone undraped humanity. All
I of this involved no immodesty because there was no need for modesty. The
human tody was not from shame of exposure scrupulously concealed. On the
contrary, it would have been almost sacrilege pot to have exposed it to universal
admiration. It was held to be beautiful when healthy and strong and graceful.
The nude did not exist. There was nakedness, not nudity. Excess of clothing,
blushes consequent upon nudity, predominance of lust in the mind in lieu of
appreciation 01 beauty in the eye, these all came when the people deteriorated
and men could no longer stand the fatigues of athletic contests. Then Grecian
art declined. , " ' ; , ..,.,-
The next great period of art was the Renaissance, in the latter half of the
m fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth centuries, in Italy. Religion was then
all powerful, but it was much colored by human ambition. The Pope's earthly
â¢ love of pomp and power gave Michael An girl 6 and Rafael the opportunities their
genius craved, end Rafael's 'Transfiguration," his Madonna*, his irescoesln the
Vatican, and Michael AngeloV "Last Judgment" and his frescoes in the Sistine
chapel, gave assurance to the world that art was not dead,' but had risen from the
grave to put on immortality. The aristocracy of church and state In Florence,
â¢Rome and Venice at this time was devoted mainly to the pleasures of this world.
He ruled who had the strongest arm and keenest blade": and bravest heart-
I Physical health and strength and skill were every mnn's first ,' care. Tne perfect
ing of the human body was one of man's chief aims. The most important acquire
ment in the art of drawing was to make a good drawing of a naked man or woman
Michael Angelo spent several years dissecting human bodies in order to know"
how to draw them. All the great artists of this period-Michael Angelo, Rafael.
Leonardo da \ mci, < orregio, T,tian-and after them the Flemish Rubens, strove
.hardest to raint a perfect human body, because nothing else in nature was so
. .beautiful. They were alike in this common inspiration. . They differed only in
treatment of this common theme. .
In this difference lay their originality. Each depicted humanity as his soul
conceived it. as Iks artistic eye saw it, as his geniu, told him that nature would
have developed it if man and circumstance had not marred it. No one of them
agreed with, another, and yet all were correct, each Â«rom his own point of view.
Had any one of them not been correct, had he attempted to create instead of de
voutly copying nature as he felt he saw it. hnd his ideal not been built upon the
rial, he woulA have failed and his name would have been lost In the lapse of cen
turies. Art was poor and hysterical before the Renaissance, it became poor and
unnatural after these great artists had passed away and for the same cause as In
ancient Greecs. .
The Venus of Milo and the School of Athens marked the two greatest periods
. in the history of art.. These two masterpieces are beacon light, o? "sKlein
the , .surrounding darkness of the centuries like two distant lighthouses in the
multitudinous seas. Art in each of these works reached its zenith
What did art at its zenith accomplish for civilization? It should have dona
more then than at Â«ny other time. It did not save culture progress national
health, strength or glory from decay. -. On the contrary it was followed c'osclvin â¢
eacn case by moral, physical and national decline. It gave to the world *t the o
periods the sublinrent expressions of man's idea of the beautiful it found its in
spiratiou in nature ai.d in np.ture its highest type was tbe human bcdV It led
man to the study, of nature in the search for the beautiiul.it taught him thVt
God's grandest creation was man and that healtn and strength were necessary to
his full development. Surely this was v good lesson. Civilization is impossible
without it. â¢
But appreciation of the beautiful is one of the resultants of civilization not
one of Its causes. It follows after the struggle for bread is fcuccessful, the contest
. for wealth is won, the conflicts of the battlefield arc fought out to victory it re
; fines, elevates, ennobles man, develops his soul, raises his gaze from the sod to
the star. But it cannot sustain : civilization. If; history teaches anything, the
glorification of art is rather an indication that civilization is reaching its zenith
.' and that the down grade is approaching. It is the light that crowns the summit
and illumines man's best condition. Prosperity is not, however, the best school
for mankind. Character is built up by struggling to be prosperous. Its most
dangerous foe is the attainment of the end desired. â â â 
Are we not more civilized at the end of the nineteenth century than in the
fifth century before Christ or at the end of the fifteenth century after Christ? We
are; but we are again fighting for breed, and the hosts, of wealth and poverty are
watching each other across, the battlefield. The/craving for the useful almost
drives out the love of the beautiful. The eyes of the people are not trained to apÂ»
\ preciation of painting or sculpture. Art is not in their soul. â  There is no public
* opinion on winch art can feed. Â Uncultured wealth in seeking for culture is try
ing to build up, to encourage art and bribe it 'to decorate its marble But
art that can be bribed, that goes for inspiration only to the money-bags of Croesus,
has no soul. Sucn is not great art. Nature reveals to it naught ,of her beauty.'
\ Art is, however, imperishable. . Nature during certain periods simply withaoias
-, out does not throw away the key to her treasures. '.'.'
At us own proper nour the love of the b.-autiful will, again fill our lives as of
cria ln Greece arid Italy, and will find. expression in the genius of some modern 7

Wit, wisdom and eloquence characterized the speeches at the twenty-second annual dinner of the Chit-Chat Club of Saa Francisco on
Monday evening last. William Greer Harrison presided, and, after the elaborate dinner, introduced the literary exercises in an appropriate
and happy manner. The music, rendered at intervals during the evening, was arranged by Professor H. J. Stewart, in a way to answer the
question, "What Has Music Done for Civilization?" The programme of the speakers was as follows:
"What Has Law Done for Civilization?" Hon. D. M. Deimas.
" What Has Art Done for Civil izetion?" Horace G. Platt.
"What Has Science Done for Civiiivation, as Illustrated by late Discoveries
as Regards the Seat of Life?" Professor Gustav Elsen.
â¢â¢Whai Has Keligion Done for Civilization?" Professor Bernard Moses. â¢
Each effort was a masterpiece, and their publication will be hailed with delight by the boat of readers who will appreciate the sentiments

CIVILISATION`S DEBT TO LAW
By .Hon. D. JA. Delmas
Mr. President: The sentiment to which I *m called upon to respondâ the
effect of law upon civilization â assumes at a glance such vast proportions that it
seems difficult witiiln the limit ol time necessurtly imposed by the exigencies of
the present occasion to attempt to give even so much as a general outline of the
thoughts which its mention evokes. To describe the gradual but ceaseless and
resistless evolution of the human race from the condition of rudeness In which
history and ethnology teach it was found not so very many centuries ago; to
descry the first faint glimmer of the light of arts, scie'nee and philosophy upon
the remote inhabitants of India; to discern its gradual expansion beyond the
confines of the empire watered by the Indus and the Ganges; to trace its dawn
upon the Grecian Archipelago, and watch it lingering long and lovingly upon the
shores of the Piraeus and the homes of tbe heroes, the Muses and the fabled deities
ot Hellenic mythology, vivifying the arts, the liteiature and the philosophy
which for over twenty centuries have held sway over mankind and left tlieir
constant and ineffaceaDie impress upon all succeeding Western civilizations; to
see it gradually tinging with its rays the crest of the seven hills of Rome, trans
forming it by degrees info the abode of wiiatever was exalted in the realm of
human achievements; to gaze uron its refraction from the imperial metropolis
of the Caesars along the Mediterranean till on the one shore it illumined its
margins irom the delta of the Nile to the Pillars of Hercules, and on the other,
following tbe Maritime Alps, dazzied with its splendor the barbaric inhabitants
of Gaul, of Spain and of Britain ; to uehold it stationary for a thousand years, its
westward course arrested, and then, accompanying the daring caravels of the
Genoese navigator, shining upon their path across the affronted perils of un
explored seas and kindling at last the al;*r fires of a new race of men upon a new

deepest interest and most touching instructionâ to contemplate the mountains,

homes of a new order of beings who, in the advancement of arts, literature and
science, in the development of the resources and the natural advantage? which
are the basis as well of individual happiness as of National prosperity, have, in
less than a century, reached a point where they may well challenge the admira
tion and excite the generous emulation of the most favored of the sons of men
in the most lavored climesâ to do this, I say, to undertake this task and then to at
tempt to measure and define the influence which law has had upon this ever
expanding light of civilization, how it has removed the obstacles in its path and
made secure its gradual conquest over the empire of darkness, were a task van;
as the history of the human raceâ commensurate with the achievements of the
human mindâ limitless as the aspirations of the human heart, a tank far beyond
the strength or ability of him who feels honored to be here numbered among
your guests.
But. Mr. President, if the general scope of the subject Is too vast perhaps one
example may serve at least to illustrate it. Asked what has been the influence
of law upon civilization, I might answer: Look around you. Recall and reflect
upon what has taken place within the last few days under our own eyes there,
where Western civilization has taken its last stand. One week ago this very
night we presented the spectacle of a Nation of seventy millions of people
divided into two hostile camps, each led by its own supreme commander each
composed of nearly one-half the population, each filling its ranks with members
eager, intent upon victory. For over three months a struggle ior rule and
supremacy, protruded and intense, bad been waged, and tha conte-t had then
reached its highest point of fierce culmination. The principles contended ior by
both parties seemed in direct antagonism each to the other. From the iips of ten
thousand orators and in the columns of ten thousand papers were ciai.y issuing
denunciations of opponents predictions of dire < alamities to follow the defeat of
a favored champion, aid auguries of unexampled blessings and prosperity to
wait upon Ms success. Processions of sincere and earnest men marched in serried
ranks through the streets of crowded cities, bearing aloft banners with mottoes
typifying their own fa th or deriding the tenets of their antagonists. Ensigns
were defiantly flung to the breeze, and the emblem that floats equally over the
arts oi pence and tne smoke of battle, the revered symbol of the Nation, was
borne aloft by both the contending hosts as a challenge to the world that it alone
was worthy to be the protector of the Nation's honor and the defender of the
Nation's interests.
The excitement which ever attends the confrontation of large bodies of men,
actuated by different alms, seeking different objects and contending upon differ
ent lines for mastery, had reached the zenith and seemed to threaten resort to
supreme, though dread, arbiter of human contentionsâ force. The next day had
been designated as the day of battle. And what happened tnen ? The adu.t pop
ulation of this Nation, tnroughout the vast expanse of its Imperial domain,
marched to the scene of conflict The institutions of the country and the time
honored traditions of the age had decreed that the contest should be one of mind
and not of matter, of principles and not of arms, of peace and not of war. And
peacefully did it take place. Even there, where the antagonism was most strenu
ous, not an incident occurred to dim the splendor or mar tbe perfection of the
spectacle. Tiie sun went down; but not over a field cf carnage. Its expiring
beams were not reflected by the grimed visage of the victor, flushed with savage
exultation, nor dicf they fall upon the lifeless face of a defeated foe. .Instead, a
great people sat in calm majesty to determine the result of* victory of peace By
the light of bonfires, under the fierce glare of electricity, through the livelong
nignt, throngs crowded the streets of great cities, surging to and fro like the
waves of a mighty ocean in their eagerness to catch the indications of triumph
or defeat.
And in all this there was no commotion, no contention, no violence Before
another sun haa risen the decision had beea announcedâ each party knew the
decree that fate had had in store as the culmination of its aspirations or dcath
kuell of its hopes. And when the sun rose next morn it looked down upon the
Nation's millions peacefully resuming their daily toil, industrious, contented
and cheerfulâ mutual expressions of good wishes interchanged between the vic
torious and the defeated Cham pioiÃ, couched in terms of most perfect courtesy
and unaffected patriotismâ the banners taken from their staves and all trace of
contest swept away. One might have thought a pebble had Deen dropped into
the smooth waters of a Jake-a splash, a ripple and in a moment all again was
Therefore ia it, Mr. President, that if asked what influence law has had upon
civilization I would be tempted to say: What but law-law wisely framed and
wisely administeredâ has made so sublime a spectacle a possibility ? Who but a
people in whom obedience and submission to law is not so much the result of
reasoning aud reflection as an Impulse of the heart and an instinct of the mind
could exhibit such moderation In victory, such acquiescence in defeat ?

WHAT WE OWE TO RELIGION
By Professor Bernard Â«Mose{
Mr. President: It gives me pleasure to be once more a guest at this board,
and to be reminded of the wit and wisdom enjoyed here on other occasions. Re*
membering the vigorous thought and finished speech to which you have become
accustomed, I turn to the subject proposed with embarrassment, knowing that its
vital intellectual importance has brought it profoundly into the thought of every
cultivated man, and particularly to the attention of every student of history.
But the judgments concerning it which nre most frequenty heard are those pro
nounced either by the advocates or opponents of specific forms of worship. They
involve the one-sided ness and extravagance of special pleading, and leave unre
vealed tbe truth desired.
Some phases of the truth we seek will appear when we remember that the
main function of religion in social evolution is not to initiate but to conserve;
that it stands *or the forces of tmdition and instinct, and not for tiie forces of in
telllgence. Under the domination of freely acting inieliigence man appears as a
rediral, and seeks better conditions through changes which ne consciously pro
poses. Under the domination of religious instinct he appears as a conservative,
and holds to princip es and forces which he conceives to be a part of an everlast
ing order. Pure intelligence in social progress is revolutionary; in tlie creation
and pursuit of its ideals it is self-sufficient and neglectful of iradition. The relig
ious instinct, on the other band, adores that which was from the beginning, and
in its influence on progress tends to bind the present to the past, and allows the
forces of the past to help determine the affairs of the present.
The social problems which a nation in any generation has to face cannot be
solved by the pure intelligence of that nation as manifest in that generation.
The knowledge of the bulk of any community is only half-Knowledge and is in
adequate to social control. France In the Revolution cut lose from religion, re*
jected her national tradition and relied on the immediate intelligence of her peo
ple. The outcome was a fiasco; and after the Revolution had dealt its first blow
at the past there was no hope of progress for the nation till tradition, with its
halo of religion, bad been rehabilitated. The temporary failure here observca
was uuch a failure as is bound to appear whenever reform proceeds solely on the
conclusion of intelligence. We are not determined in the larger part of our
action or non-actions by the investigations and decisions of our intelligence, but
by tradition, which operates through our instincts and brings, alnady formed, a
solution for most of tho cases on which we are called to act. If we of thts com
pany work not all the evil we might do it is not because our intelligences sit in
judgment on every proposed act, but because we are moved in our conduct by tra
dition, by an inheritance of impulses which are able to make themselvcseffective
in our lives by the fact that they were involved in the religion of our ancestors'.
It is this sanctified inheritance which preserves society, in its evolution, true to
itnelf. It is this which enables a nation to carry itself steadily forward in spite of
the vagaries of immature thought and the aberrations of temporary passion.
Because religion Is conservative it is scmetlmes claimed that it hinders rather
than helps the onward movement, that it chains the wheels of progress. Take an
illustration from two drivers on one of our long, steep mountain roads. The one
chains a wheel of his wagon, and is thus enabled to carry his load steadily and
safely along the narrow decline to its destination. The other will have nothing
of such hindrances, and. with all wheels free, enters upon what he regards as his
career of rapid and uninterrupted progress. But soon his ioad is beyond control,
the leaders are in wild flight, and at a dangerous turn horses, ariver and all
are plunged over the precipice in one promiscuous ruin. If we, the
American people, with all the momentum ol the ages, have thus far been able to
keep to the ioad of genuine progress, and have safely rounaed the sharp curve
which looks into the abyss of National dishonor, it is because ihere exists in vi
still some inheritance of the things ourfaih.-rs lived for, some unconscious mem
ory, it may be, of the principles which their religious consciousness approved.
The efflcHcy of religion in relation to social evolution is, furthermore, illus
trated by its power In strengthening the sense of duty. In social concerns this
sense is weakened in proportion as emphasis is laid on individual rights. Since
the loud proclamation of the richts of man in the last century the doctrine there
involved has operated on society as a disintegrating force. It has tended to
make the individual man forgetful of everything but his claims. It has encour
aged his natural selfishness aud made his relation to organized society consplcu
ousiy a relation of personal, material profit. In itself it points only to anti-social
consequences. In order, therefore, that through its influence the development
of society may not be prevented, or the bonds of social intercourse be dissolved,
the recognition of rights must be supplemented by the recognitiou of duties.
The assertion of rights presumes eocial antagonisms; the performance of du
ties suggests the spirit ol association. It is, therefore, only with the recognition
of duties that stcial evolution begins; and in the whole course ol social growth
no agency hai been more powerful than religion in enforcing and keeping alive
the sense of duty, and thus implanting in men the qualities under which society
proceeds by evolution to a higher standard.
It may not be maintained that rel igion lielps directly to build means of com
munication, to establish and operate factorlts, or, in any other way, to bring the
forces of nature Into subjection to mun. But doing these things is only one
phase of progress. In the course of national evolution there are ages of action
and ages of ideas, and the achievements of both are essential to true social de
velopment. Neither the heroic undertaking of the Athenians against the Per
sians, nor the events of the period of material prosperity which loliowed, gives us
a fnli view ot Athenian civilization. The development was not complete till the
spirit oi the nation had unfolded itself in the creation of religious and artistic
ideals, and realized through these the higher manifestations of social existence.
What is true of the Athenians is true of every nation. However great its power
and economic achievements, its evolution is incomplete till it has acquired clear
religious ideals that have found expression in life. And it is to religion, more
over, that society must look for the transmission of its highest conceptions irom
generation to generation. What religion teaches about God and moral conduct
has taken iorra through human thought, and this doctrine gathered Into one
body and accepted ns part of the system of religion goes everywhere bearing the
stamp of divine authority. And throughout the ages the re.igious system is
destined to be the means through wnich the highest thoughts of the race on God
and human life are preserved and made a portion of our common inheritance.
It maintains the continuity of our highest conceptions, and carries them on with
all their uplifting force, frcm age to age and from nation to nation.
The continual iteration of "There is no god but God" has kept this thought
in the Mohammedan mind, and lifted the followers of the prophet above the
degradation of their earlier day*. And modern philosophy, with Us combination
of assumptions and unverified deductions, has struggled in vain to form a higher
conception of God than that which Judaism and Christianity have proclaimed
and carried on from century to century.
But there is a still more important service which religion renders to social
evolution. By emphasizing the spiritual as contrasted with the physical side ol
man's being, a basis has been laid lor a new and higher estimate of the worth of
human life; and this new conception ol the dignity and worth of man has given
rise to many of the characteristic qualit'es of the wond's ripest civilization. It
underlies the movement in behalf of universal education. It has called into
existence the whole scheme of modern charity, Irom the care and training of
waifs to the effort* to protect and redeem the idiotic and the insane. It has
tended to deprive the penalties oi the law of their iormer barbarity without
diminishing their efficiency in defending the peaceful and the virtuous. In a
word, it has given to the civilization of this age a rank not attained by that of
any other age, although other ages may have transcended us in the excellence of
their literature and the perfection of their art.
If the devotee of science, in the assurance of htszeal, feels obliged to announce
tp.at his investigations nowhere lead to a knowledge of God; if the philosopher
descends from his lofty flight in the realm of mataphysics, and brings no tidings
of a personal moral ruler, the world need not be dismÃyed; every age in the
course of intellectual progress has been obliged to revise the scientific conclusions
and philosophical opinions of preceding ages; the wisdom of yesterday has
become the folly of to-day; and yet throughout all the vicissitudes which have
marked the growth of society, men have held consistently to the conception of
God as the center of the physical and moral universe, the corner-stone of
religion, the object of human faith, the sublime working hypothesis of humanity
THE MAGIC WAND OF SCIENCE
By Professor Gustav Eisen
As early as 300 years ago the microscope, imperfect as it was, revealed to the
student of biology the fact that both plants and animals are composed of what
was then called cells. The minuteness of these cells prevented a profounder
knowledge of their structure. It was supposed that the cells were solid or homo
geneous throughout, and that nature s object with cell structure and cell bound
aries was simply to keep the body of the animal or plant together. The name cell
was given to these minute structures on account of resemblance to the honey
comb of the bee.
For nearly 300 years the naturalists were satisfied with this imperfect knowl
edge; no great effort was made to further reveal the intricate structure of the
cell, and no endeavor to improve the methods and instruments of Research. In
the beginning of this century a decided advance was made, when simultaneously
several naturalists discovered that the contents of the cell was not a solid one,
but that it contained at least one strongly differentiated body to which was given
tbe nainu of nucleus. It soon became evident that this nucleus was a most impor
tant body; that it possessed lunctions essential to the life of the cell, and that it
at times showed activities and changes, not at the time explainable. Several
decades later it became known through observation that when a cell divided tho
process began not on the exterior but iv the interior ot the cell. It had already
been long known that when the body of an animal or a plant grows and increases
in size, this growth is caused by cell division. Thousands and thousands of the
cells iv the body then divide and divide again, and soon, through the assimila
tion of food, increase to the same size as the present cells. It is by this indivision
and increase in size of tf.e cells that the body grows, and this law is applicable to
all organic life, whether ol animals or plants.
But the great question was, how did this division of cells and increases of
volume take place? What caused the cells to divide? Where was the motive
power that guided this operation? Was it a complex or simple one? Was it the
same in animal and vegetable tissues, or did it differ in the respective kingdoms
of nature? Tnis ard similar questions remained unanswered to within a few
years ago. That we have been abe to answer them at all and in a satisfactory
way is entirely due to modern methods in microscopical study. It is to these
distinct discoveries that this advance is especially due. The first one is the dis
covery of a new chemical glass, which has enabled the manufacturers of micro,
scopes to produce much better lensesâ lenses with more defining power, lenses
that will more clearly demonstrate the minutest structures formerly unsuspected
by the best-informed students. The second discovery which has aided micros
copy and biology in general is the invtntion of aniline colors. By the aid of
these it is now possible to stain the different structures iv thj cell differently and
in such a way that every isolated part stands out distinctly by itself. These
colors are selective, and in the hands of a skillful manipulator will produce
wonders as regards microscopic demonstration. The third discovery, without
which microscopy would not have advanced, is the invention of the microtome,
an instrument by which thin sections of animal and vegetable tissue might be
cut. So perfect is the instrument now made that we can cut sections 35,000 to
an inch thick, though generally one-half or one-fourth of that suffices ior ordi
nary investigations.
The modus operandl in microscopical work is then first to cut the section*
then to stain them, ana afterward observe them with the best lenses of modern
make. By these means a biologist a few years ago discovered in the cell another
body besides the nucleus, one hundred times more animate and apparently of
homogeneous structure. To thlÃ body was given the name "centrosome, " mean
ing tne central body in the cell. It was soon found that this cantrosome played
a most important part in cell division, and it is yet doubtful if, without it. any
cell division could take place. The centrosome was first found in the cells of
animal tissue and later on in those of plants. It is now almost certain that it
exists in the healthy cells and that it is a most important organ in the cell
There are many different theories as regards its nature, and, though several
thousand books and papers have been published on the subject within a very
few years, thousands more must be published before we know the whole truth
about this interesting body. .
The microscope reveals to us tnat just before a cell divides the centrosome
shows great activity, and that it div des. The two halves, or rather the two new
centrosomes thus formed, send out minute protoplasmic rays all through the cell
and at the same time they move apart. This movement apart is rapid and con
cise. In a few minutes or In less than an hour the two centrosomes will have
moved so that each one is situated at the opposite poles of the cell, each one
at opposite ends of the nucleus. By this time the whole cell is full of these pro
jecting rays streaming out from the two central ones. They penetrate every
where, even into the nucleus, in which they cause very important and violent
disturbances and changes.
The principal points of the nucleus are the dark-staining bodies or rods, known
as the chromosomes, because they stain darker than any other substance in the
cell, except the centrosome itself. It has been proven of late, within a few months,
that these chromosomes are tbe carriers of hereditary characteristics from one cell
to another, irom the parent to the child, from the cells of the seed to the full
grown tree or flower. In indivision it is therefore of the greatest importance
that these chromosomes should be equally divided, not only as to quantity but in
quality as well. If too much is given to one cell and too little to another it is
evident a disturbance will take place in the development of tbe plant or the
animal species and that one offspring would resemble its parents a great deal
and the other much less.
In the blood of certain animals we find at least two distinct corpuscles, the Im
portance of which can hardly be overestimated. These corpuscles or globules
are the red and the white, each class having a different function.
In each individual corpuscle we find a centrosome, which there, as In all
other cells, performs its function in directing cell division and assisting and man
ipulating the chromosomes. But when the cells have been worn out and become
no more useful they are tnrown away as so much waste material, dissolved by the
fluids of the body and carried away by them. But the centrosome does not at
once follow the rest of the dead cell. Indeed, while the cell and its nucleus dies,
the centrosome surrounds itself with some protoplasmic covers, which grow in size
and assume regular spherical form. This new body separates itself ultimately
from the dead and decaying cell, and swims out into the liquid of the blood
as a new and independent body, capable of growth and assimilation of food,
movement and sensitiveness. We find them in the blood of certain animals In so
great a quantity and of so great a size that they can be readily studied, while in
the blood of other nnimals they are much smaller and more difficult to discern,
but they are not the less real and not of less importance. To this body as a whole,
the centrosome surrou ded by several spheres of protoplasmic matter, I have
given the name of archosome. the "old body," and perhaps the original body in
the cell. If its existence will be found in all cells only future investigations will
show. At present I have been able to demonstrate it in the blood cells of half a
dozen animals, including man, and also in several cells of various animals ol
different degrees oi systematic development, such as in the epidermal cells of tbe
earth worm, in the lung cells of the large garden slug and in a few others.
Allowing tnat in time the archosome will be found in all cells at some period
in its existence the question will then arise about Its relationship to the cell it
self. Is it an organ in the cell or is the cell a covering for the archosome? In
what relationship does the nucleus stand to the archosome and the cell? An in
teresting theory has been advocated ot late by a few biologists in regard to this
relationship. They contend that originally the nucleus and the cell were two
distinct and separate entities, living apart from each other and in no way de
pendent upon each other as they arenow. This must have been at the beginning
or shortly after the beginning of organized life. In course of time a parasitism
took place, a symbiosis or living together of the nucleus and the cell. One be
came dependent upon the other for its welfaie and later on for its existence, they
became messmates to such an extent that the secretions of the one become a
necessity for the other, and the two together became capable of development as a
whole organized body, as a new being.
To-day there exists no nucleus without a cell, and no cell without a nucleus,
and the conclusion is therefore legitimate that neither can exist under present
conditions without the other. This was the theory only a little while ago, before
the archosome was discovered to possess an individuality of its own. Now when
we know that this body can separate itself from the balance of the cell elements
ana survive whilo they go to decay; when v/e can follow the development of the
archosome from a minute beginning to a final development of much larger ?ize;
when we Know that this body possesses structure and form, movement and sensi
tiveness and that it is capable of assimilating food; when, in fact, we can demon
strate that it possesses all the characteristics of individuality, are we not then
justified In assigning to it a more important function than that of a mere organ
in the cell?
The famous cell theory will have to be modified, and if we now concede a
symbiosis between the different structures of the cell instead of a mere relation
ship na organs in the same body, theu this symbiosis must exist between thn
principal parts of the cell, between the nucleus and the archosome, instead of
the nucleus and the cell. lithis is so then the cell itself is either a secondary struc
ture resulting from the mutual development of the nucleus and the archosome, or
it is an independent body, showing with the nucleus and the arch some a
triune symbiosis, the result ot which is the common cell of animal or vegetable
tissue. We might conclude that each one of these three structures has its impor
tant function to perform in the small biological colonyâ the cell to protect and
nourish, the nucleus to transmit hereditary qualities, and the archosome to di
rect and govern the division of the cell and perhaps some of us other functions
and activities. Countless numbers of these triune bodies go to maKe up the general
structure of organic life, and in tbe innermost of these, the archosome, muÂ«t wÂ«
search for tbe seat ot mechanical and possibly also for individualised lite.

MUSICALES.
The King's Daughters and the
McKenzte Society Entertain.
A MUSICAL entertainment was given on
Saturday afternoon last at the King's
Daughters' Home. Miss Ida Diserens
had charge of the following programme: Vio
lin solos, "Walther's Prize Song" (Wagne-)

Ace Led FolloWed by LoW Card.
This question is one that has caused consid
erable discussion in whist circles as to whether
the ace should be followed by the original
fourth or fifth best when leading from ace and
four or more small. Cavendish advocates the
drop to the original fif'.h best and Mr. N. B.
Trist thinks otherwise. He says the ace should
be followed by the original fourth best. Ham
ilton in his second edition of "Modern Scien
tific Whist," just issued from tne press, de
votes fifteen pages to a very extended analysis
of this play. He presents the case very clearly
in the following words: It has been pointed
out that the precise information afforded by
the lead of the original fourth bestâ after the
lead of the aceâ may enable the second hand
to pursue with safely against the leader. It is
unquestionably true that the leader, endeav
oring to exhibit the precise value of his inter,
mediate cards, may assist the tecond hand in
his play. On the other hand, it is admitted
that the t-econd lead of the original fourth
best will very often afford valuable informa
tion to the leader's farmer; that the second
lead of the original fifth best or any lower
card will withhold. The point to be de
termined is this:
Do the many advantages claimed for the
original founh best after ace outweigh the
ioss resulting from the adverse finessing of the
second hand?
HAMILTON'S OPINION.
It appears c ear to the author thnt the bal
ance of advantage is overwhelmingly in favor
of the original fourth best after ace as against
the second lead of the original fifth best on
any Jower card. The conclusion that Hamil
ton arrives at. eccomp&nied by such an ex
haustive analysis, coupled with the opinion
of the father of the American lÂ«*d system,
Nicholas B. Trist, will no doubt settle for all
time this questionâ with American whist
players, at least. The writer has advocated
for over four years that when the original
leader holds ace and four or five others, with
out king or queen, jack, the suit should be
opened as though it were trumps, with the
lourth best, if there in any possibility of bring
ing it in; if not. treat it as a short suit and
commence at the other end.

Miss Carrie Bowes, the well-known pianiste,
entertained a large number of guests on
Wednesday evening at the residence of Mrs.
given. Although Cavendish has now adopted
the follow with fourth best remaining in
hand, my experience sustains me in the prac
tice of following with ; original fourth best.
The question is now one of minor importance,
since fourth best i* now so often led from ace,
5 or more in suit. * â¢ â¢ I have always
taken it for granted that the time-honored
original ~ lead of \ king, with : queen and two
small, is- more conducive to trick-making than
the lead of . fourth best, and : will continue to
think so until an "exhaustive analysis by a
Whitfield proves the contrary. Will send you
soon a sub-echo hand, as promised. Thanks
for whist clippings from Call. They are al
ways interesting to me. Yours sincerely,

Whist Queen and Whist /Author.
We have been highly honored in receiving
irom her Majesty Miss Kate Wheelock the
first proof copy of her new book, "Whist
Rules." In a letter to our whist editor she
says:
"I only got It out becauce so many of my
pupils did not want :o take lime to do all the
writing, and I commenced, as you know, with
type-writing. But the demand grew until I
was forced to get it into print. In the first
place, it is not what you would call a practi
cal book, as its cover is tp be abeautiiul cream
white with the one word WHIfcT in led em
bossed letters; therefore, it will soil easily. I
have given no explanation of things, merely
referring to the other books. Taking it for
granted that it is only what I pretended it to
be. a help for my pupils, they are supposed to
understand the rules and not need an ex
planation.
"In other words, it is as near as possible the
way I teach. I have received a great many
letters about it, and am rather frightened at
the thought of really getting it out."
How modestly the little Queen puts it To one
that we owe so much, in a whist way, we have
nothing but words of praise. This little
whist treasure will receive a real hearty wel
come in every home in ttie land where whist
is played. We cannot do this little work full

me they comprise almost a season's lessons to
those who will heed. (I am a teacher of wbist
here.) As they are printed for your friends,
perhaps there are not enough to distribute
elsewhere, but if so please state prtae. It is
too valuable a nugget to do without if possible
to obtain it. I read your whist column every
week and find it more helpful than any other
in the country (always excepting, of course,
our Mr. Vtork). It is so direct and so plain, so
breezy and so full of food I am thoroughly in
spired and rejuvenated by it. The Tormey
discard is worthy of universal commendation.
Its very simplicity renders it so easy of use,
and I never really understood the eleven rule
until 1 read your explanation. Very truly

American Whist League Trophy.
The New York Whist Club that won the
American Whist League trophy at the sixth
congress at Manhattan Beach, claimed and
heralded by the New York Sun as short suiters
and as loudly denied by some of the team,
came to sudden grief when they run cp
against Providence. The first challenge
match w as w jth the Philadelphia Club; the
New Yorks won. The second on the list (New
Jersey) forfeited, said to be scared off. They
tried to swap dates â sort of sparring for wind â
but couldn't make it. When "Little Rhody,"
with their team of slants, headed by Walter
H. Barney, their president, who is also presi
dent of the American Whist League, came up
for the third round, and to meet their doom,
as the New York boys put it, something
dropped, and, when the smoke of battle
cleared away, Othello's occupation was gone,
and with it the trophy. We expect to see the
whist columns in the Sun bordered with half
an inch of black.
The Public Ledger of Philadelphia gives this
account of the fourth round: The Narragan
sett Whist Club defeated the Brooklyn Whist
Club last Saturday in the A. W. L. challenge
trophy contest. The match had a sensational
finish, inasmuch as the score was tie at the
end of forty-eight deals, and in the play off
Narragansett made a net gain of eight tricks.
The result was a source of the greatest
pleasure to Walter H. Barney, who is presi-

Examiner. They recalled the fact that
.during tbe campaign several articles ap
peared on the Examiner's editorial page

mittee and $70 to ti;e N T on-Partisan cam
paign committee. Mr. Phelan modestly
adds that all of this money came from his

by others.
Jndg<> Hunt's statement shows that he
'.expended $385 05 in the campaign which
resfulted in his return to the Superior

paid to James Alva Watt, who receipted
for the same as ''chairman county com
mittee purity of election."

â¢ committee, his receipt disclosing the f.tct
that he contr buted $375. Hia total ex
. pensea were $400 75.

perior Court Judge, expended $390 50, of

MORE WORK FOR
THE POLITICIANS
Independent Candidates to
File Separate Peti
tions.
Judge Wallace Indicates His
Opinion on This Phass
of the Law.
DEFENSE ON A PIE JURY CHARGE
If Finally Sustained It Will Have
a Far-Reaching Eff.ct on
Fu'ure Actions.
In Judge Wallace's department of the
Superior Court there is a case on argu
ment entitled tbe People against Ayhern,
that will prove of unusual interest to the
politicians of California in practically ap
plying tbe provisions of the so-called
Australian election law. It may lead to a
decision that will seriously interfere with
the aspirations of would-be candidates
who are not strong enough to get on the
blanket-ticket by reason 01 their own
popularity, and who are therefore con
straineu to seek the assistance of others in
order to secure the necessary 3 per cent of
signatures of qualified voters.
An information was filed against Panl
A. Ayhern rhareiig him with perjury for
having sworn on (Vtober 12, 1896, that E.
J. Stone, C. Dietrick, Henry K. Bond, C.
A. Buck and Morris Wendt signed a cer
tain petition for nomination of certain
men to be members of the Legislature,
when in fact he knew that the persons
named did not sign the document.
In the information an alienation is
ma'iethat "a full set of City and County
officers were to be chosen" at the election
then pending.
On this the defendant, by his attorney,
John J. Guilfoyle Jr., tiled a demurrer on
the ground that the information is not
sufficiently explicit in its terms. He said
he was not sure that the office of Assem
blyman would be included in wnat tbe
District Attorney by his information
called "a full set of City and County offi
cers." If the office of Assemblyman is
not so included, and in view of recent de- |
cisions by the Supreme Court, it appeared
difficult lor any one to say what is "a lull
set of City and County officers," then the
act of Ayhern, if actually performed, was
not material, and no offence had been
commuted.
Deputy District Attorney Hinkle con
tended that the defendant was given all
the iniormation to which he was entitled,
and possibly more than he liked to hear.
He thou.ht the document was in proper
form. ,
Judge Wallace at this point took a hand
in the discussion. He wanted to under
stand Mr. Guilfoyle'* position.
"Do ou contend that it is essential for
the particular office for which the nomi
nee was proposed shall be set forth in the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1896.
information or indictment?" asked the
court.
"I do," replied Mr. Guilfoyle, "and I
further contend that for each separate
nominee there must be a separate petition
tiled under the Australian ballot law.
Therefore, any act alleged tushave been
performed in any other manner would be
invalid and of no effect. In such a case
an information charging a crim for an
act thus described could not be sustained."
Judge Wallace apppared to be disposed
to accent this view. On reading the law
he said it seemed that each man who
seeks to be placed on the ballot by peti
tion must stand on his own merits; that
he is not privileged to join with another
or others in onier to secure the necessary
percentage of s gnatures which would en
title him to a place on the official ballot.
If such a practice were permitted it might
result in the people accepting as a nomi
nee a man they did not want in order to
get one they did want. Such a state of
affairs might result from the filing of a
full ticket nominated by a conrention, but
that appeared to be provided for by the
law, whereas the opposite wa-< the provi
sion that related to the putting of indi
vidual names < n the t.cket by petition.
Mr. Hinkie asked permission to submit
a brief on the matter, and the case was
accordingly continued by the court for
future cons deration.
If Judse Wallace's views of the law as
here outlined had been enforced before the
last election, t.O National Democratic
party would hay- been required to rile a
separate petition for each of the Presi
dential electors named on be. aif of
Palmer and Buclcner.

The Conditions of tbe Mining and
Other Interests as Told by
M Bark.
M. Bark, for fifteen years a resident of
Derning, N. Mex., and long one of the
owners of the Victoria combination of
mines, is at the Occidental.
"Our interests down there," he said yes
terday, "are almost exclusively gold, silver
and copper mining ana cattle- raising, and
the different kinds of business that grow
oat of these.
"Deming, which, as is fairly well known,
is at th â  junction of the Santa Fe and
Southern ricific railroads, now has from
1.00 to 1400 people. Twenty-seven miles
nwnv is Silver City, the capital of Grant
County, in which the tv.o towns are lo
cated. Bilver City is quite a vigorous
camp, and a good deal oi gold and silver
is being mined there. It is the most im
portant camp around there. However,
there are several others in the vicinity
that are yielding some ore.
"The Victoria mine is situated about
twenty miles west of DeminÂ«r. It pro
duces cold, silver and lead. I am inter
ested in three claims there. Ha'gn and
Hearst have seven, and W. M. Lent owns
some interests also. It is a rich mining
region, and the people are well satisfied
with it.
l> ln cattle-growing the country about
Deming has made great strides. In 1892
about half the cattle were dead, owing to
the drouth, but during the last three years
ML Burk, One of the Owners of the
Victoria Mine, Near Deming.
[Sketched from life by o " Call " artist.]
tbe conditions have been so favorable for
cattle that they have increased so fast
that there are more now than there ever
were. Not only that, but the prices are
good. Thus it is that there is great pros
perity among the cattle-growers."
Mr. Burk will be in the City for several
days.
Bnrglar* Held to Answer.
W. Kelly, W. Tulby, alias King, and Thomas
Cornwell were yesterday held to answer before
tbe Superior Court by Judge Campbell on the

They are accused of breakine into the Cali

streets, some weeks ago and stealing eight
cases of whisky. Kelly was also held on a
similar charge of having broken into the Pa
cific Mail dock und stolen a quantity ot metal.

NE W YORK, N. V., Nov. B.â 'Fill all

Thus sang a humble poet of American
soil, Cornelius Matthews by name, a man
who left behind a little volume of verse
which should live and be always treasured
among the gems of American literature.
If we could always keep a cheerful,
happy melody ringing in rhythmic meas
ure through our inmost beings, we would
never find ourselves the miserable pos
sessors of "a regular old stem-winding
case of blues." There is a man who,
whenever he finds himself threatened
with an attack of the "dumps" or
"blues," straightway brings out a small
plate of glass, as clear and red as a pigeon
blood ruby, and religiously gazes through
it, until by the psychoiogical influence of
color over the senses, he finds himself
growing cheerful and happy. The roseate
hue which seems to bathe all objects
about bim makes him forget his despond
ency, and he awakens to the sweet enjoy
ment oi life and its trials once more.
After ail it is absurd to fancy shadows
are everywhere, for there is a Bong and a
burst of sunshine through all our days if
we would only let our dull ears hear and
our dim eyes see.
Colonel and Mrs. M. H. Hccht of San
Francisco have been in town since last
Wednesday and are at the Holland.
R. E. Roberts, the popular and well
known mining man of San Francisco,
reached New York a few days ago from a
two years' stay in South Africa. Mr.
Roberts is not particularly enthusiastic
concerning African mines and projects.
Ht 1 reports business very quiet and un
profitable. Mr. Roberts left on Friday
morning for Guailalajara, Mexico, to
look at a mining property which is re
ported as being very one. He will return
almost immediately to London, though he
will rind time to visit old friends in San
Francibco before ne continues the journey
eastward.
By private letter comes the intelligence
that Ambrose Bierce will be obliged to
return to the mild climate of California.
He has been rapidly losing strength within
the past month and his physicians advise
him to go west immediately, as a winter
in the severe Eastern climate might prove
fatal.
T. E. Pettingill, who for many years was
a resident of Oakland, has truly become a
"bird of passage." Within the past year
he has been through China, Japan, India
and Africa and has now reached New
York in the best of health and spirits. Mr.
Pettingill has decided to remain in New
York permanently and engage in the real
estate business. The California "colony."
here needs recruits and Mr. Pettingill is
one who will be cordially received and
welcomed.
Mrs. J. 08. Gunn and Miss Gunn are
at present visiting Mrs. Sfrran at her home
in Baltimore.
Walter Hobart has been quietly looking
about and studying the fine points of
several handsome teams lately. The other
day he made a purchase of a very stylish
pair, and if action, beauty and blood count
for auy thing, our ambitious young Califor
nia millionaire will be in the front rank
with this new acquisition to his already
magnificent stud.
Miss Agnes Johnson, known on the stage
as one of the "Stewart sisters," has re
turned from her borne in Los An?eles, to
begin an engagement in New York for
the winter. Miss Johnson is a loyal Cali

of each year in her Los Angeles home.
E. J. Baldwin left for the coast on Thurs
day. He managed to pull out of the rut
at Morris Park with about $6000 winning
on his string of horses.

Harry Pearson had a Darty of Western
friends at the "Hoffman" on election
night, and when the returns reported that
California had gone for McKinley the
cheers, "tigers" and warwboopa of ap

corks and clinkine of cut glass when toasts
were proposed "was most scandalous and

Dear, whole-souled, honest Ned Taylor
walked down Filth avenue the other aftef^
noon with a very pretty woman, to whom
he was devoting every bit of his attention.
It is rather unusual to write of a gentle
man's mode of wearing his beard, but
somehow it may prove interesting to many
of Mr. Taylor's old friends to know that
he no longer wears a full cropped beard.
Instead he wears a military mustache â
and, girls â it is very becoming.
Mrs. Amanda Jeanne Marceau (the ex-
Mrs. Tbeo. Marceau) no sooner slipped
out of bondage when presto, she Has
jumped into it again. Last Thursday
among the modest little marriage notices
in the New York Herald appeared this
item :
FEN NELLâ MARCEATJ.â On November |2,
at high noon, at the Church of the Heavenly
Rest, by the Rev. D. Parker Mdrgan, M.A.,
Amanda Jeanne Marceau of San Francisco,
Cal., to Gerald Martin FenneU of Cniselhurst,
England. London and San Francisco papers
please copy.
It seemed incredible, and Mrs. Marceau
Fenneli's acquaintances here were as
tounded to hear of her marriage. It is
true, though, for when seen at her apart
ments in the Holland Hon^e she smiled
sweetly and said in a voice fairly swelling
with happiness: "Yes, I have been very
wise and married again. I know it was
very sudden and unconventional, but Mr.
Fennell and I decided that as we would be
married quietly anyhow it would be much
better to have the ceremony performed at
once. My mother and my immediate
friends Knew of my decision at once. I
presume many will criticize, but that will
not affect me, I am so very happy now 1
Oh, so happy !" And Mrs. Fennell looks
it. Her trousseau is handsome, a number
of gowns being imported creations.
Gerald Martin Fennell is an English'
man and a member of a very distinguished
family. The ancestral home at Chisel
hurst. England, is many hundreds of
years old, and the family boasts of many
rightful crests. He is interested in DusU
ness in New York, and will, in all proba
bility, make this city their home. Mr.
and Mrs. Fennell are happy in the know!*
edge that theirs is a romance sweet and
true. Mr. Fennell won his wife's love
when she was a very young girl traveling
in Europe. She declares he was her first
sweetheart. After many years of estrange
ment they Lave met again and been
united in the linked bonaage all true lov
ers delight in. Who shall say the days of
romance are over?

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. *
Good prospects all round.
The week has been a lively one.
Chrysanthemum shows are coming in.
Read the papers of the Chit Chat Club.
The shooting stars shoot some other
eve.
We want Dusiness, but no booms this
time.
There must be a Secretary of Mines and
Mining.
Make your home a market for home
goods this week.
The miner, as well as the farmer, should
have a place in tbe Cabinet.
Our west is beyond the seas, and it is by
chips we must seek our golden markets.
Perhaps the meteors decided it would
not be proper to fall when everything cisc
is rising.
There is just one fine art in the country
that never fails to pay, and that is the art
of advjrtising.
The Monroe doctrine does not reach the
Cuban case yet, but if it ever expands it
will be in that direction.
Tbe maritims control of the Pacific will
be in our hands, provided our hands are
not idle during tbe next few years.
There Is a prospect for an early comple
tion of the coast road, and then the
tourists will see sights to brag about.
One of the humors of the situation is
the clamor of tbe free-trade press that a
reform of the deficit tariff would disturb
business.
While we are preparing for protection
to the industries of the State let us not
forget to prepare also for the expansion of
commerce.
If the Greater West firmly resolves that
the niininjr industry shall be represented
in tbe Cabinet the rest of the country will
agree to it.
Opportunities for making good invest
ments in California were never better
than now. This is a young State yet and
growing fast.
Mrs. Brvan is said to have found conso
lation in tlie fact that every State where
women are allowed to vote gave a majority
for her husband.
There is one thing we may count on
from Altneld. If he ever makes up his
mind tally that his defeat was a crime he
will be sure to pardon it.
A perfect system of taxation we can
hardly hope for, but the Assessors' con
vention ought easily to devise borne im
provement on the present one.
Senator Quay predicts "we shall have a
new tariff within eight months after Mc-
Kinley's inauguration" and the prediction
will be received as glad tidings.
Conservative Democratic journals in the
East are complaining that while their
party was very sick from free silver it is in
still more danger from the doctors who
are trying to cure it.
If you feel like writing a letter to Mc-
Kinley go take a walk in the park and
wear tho feeling oif. it is reported from
Canton that he is receiving more than a
thousand letters a day.
Voices of discontent are either becom
ing silent or else are lost in the increasing
bum of business. Certain it is we no
longer hear them as loudly as we did at
this season during the last three years.
These fellows who are guessin? that
McKinley will give a Cabinet position to
some sound-money Democrat in recogni
tion of their support during the campaign
had better hasten to guess again before the
fool-killer comes around.
Eastern fashion journals describe the
latest feminine adornment as "pneumatic
hair." It consists of a rubber air cushion
covered with hair, which, when placed on
the bead, gives the wearer the appearance
of possessing a mass of tresses, and thus
may lovely woman be said to be pneu
matically tired.
Massachusetts is enjoying a young man
who on being sent to prison for embezzle
ment studied with such diligence as to
make himself master of tbe French, Ger
man, Spanish and Italian languages and
read law with so much success that on his
recent release from prison he at once ap
plied for admission to the Boston bar.
An enterprising man has recently estab
lished in New York a winter garden fash
ioned after the Parisian style and adorned
with casts of statues of beauty, but fearing
the police would object to too much art in
a popnlar resort he clothed the statues on
the opening night with corsets, skirts and
silk-stockings, thereby achieving a ten
strike that knocked the town silly.
The prospect of an early completion of
the coast road emphasizes tbe need of
an immediate improvement of Third
street. A large proportion of visitors to
the City from tbe East will come by that
road, and we ought to arrange for their
entrance into tbe City from tbe depot by a
grand avenue and not bring them in over
a dilapidated cobblestone highway of
torture.
A SECRETARY OF MINES.
RESOLVED, Tlu.t tbÂ« California
Miners' Association strongly and ur-
gently desires the appointment of a
(Vbinet officer to be known as the Sec
retary of Mines and Mining*
The desire expressed in this resolution
cannot be attained without hard work.
There is needed a resolution to succeed,
as well as one of desire. That, in turn,
must be a resolution of will as well as or
form. It should be the resolve not
merely of the Miners' Association, but of
all the Greaujr West. It should be, more
over, a firm, fixed and determined re
solve. Let us make it so.
At the present time the affairs of the
mining industry of the United States are
scattered about among various bureaus of
the Department of the Interior. No offi
cial, not even a subordinate one, is re
sponsible for their advancement, or even
their right management. The Commis
sioner of Public Lands supervises some
part of the work, the Bureau of Miner
alogy another and the Geological Survey
a third. Thus the industry is nowhere
treated as a whole, and the inevitable re
sult is confusion and, in many cases, in
justice.
The necessity for a better supervision of
the industry is made evident by the re
peated memorials to Congress from the
miners stating specifically the evils from
which they suffer under existing condi
tions, and aiso by the difficulty they ex
perience in obtaining even the most ele
mentary and necessary legislation to
secure their rights and advance their in
terests.
The magnitude of the industry is in
itself sufficient to justify the establish
ment of a separate department in the Na
tional Government for its management.
Mining not less than agriculture should
have its representative in the Cabinet. It
is an industry carried on in all sections of
the Union from the Alleghanies to tbe
Pacific Coast. In the fullest sense it ia a
great National industry and should have
National recognition.
There is. however, something more than
the extent of the industry to be consid
ered. It, is one whose successful operation
involves great expense. It is conducted
under an infinite variety of conditions
ancV in many instances in keen competi
tion with the rest of the world. It is.
moreover, a thoroughly scientific industry,
and the American mirier must be kept
posted on all newly discovered processes
if he is to accomplish the best results in
his work.
The subject is not one that calls for
argument at this time. The campaign of
education in regard to it will come in due
season later on. The people of the great
mining States understand already tbe im
portance of the object aimed at. The first
thing to be done is to rouse in them a deter
mination to attain it It is to that end we
direct our efforts this morning.
The Call promises to the miners in this
contest all the assistance which its presses,
its circulation and its influence can give.
"Whatever can be done by calling public at
tention totheissueandconcentrating popu
lar sentiment into a resolute determination
we will do. The mining industry has too
long been neglected by the Government.
It has grown too great to be left to subor-
I dinate officials in different bureaus. The
work of the Interior Department has be
come too large and too diverse for a single
Secretary to give proper attention to all
the needs of its various sections. It will
benefit the whole country to take mines
and mining out of that overloaded depart
ment and make it a department of itself.
That is the reform to work for. Let us
rally all the Greater West to unite with us
in the task and go forward and win.
A NEW CHARTER
Tbe ascertainment of the fact that it
would be impossible to provide for, pre
pare, vote upon and submit a new
charter to the next Legislature for
its approval will probably allay a
somewhat too feverish anxiety on the
part of some over the holding of another
charter election in the immediate future.
In fact, apart from tbe legal obstacles in
tbe way, it, would be somewhat unwise on
the part of those who believe that San
Francisco should have a new organic law
to resubmit the issue so soon after its de
feat.
There is a wiser course to pursue and
one for which there is ample time Drior to
the Legislative session of two years hence.
That course is tbe careful preparation by
a board of freeholders, the eminence of
whose members shall place it above re
proach, of a charter which shall omit not
only the objectionable features which
caused the defeat of its immediate prede
cessor, but also those objections which
have defeated the several former charters
for the past sixteen years.
It cannot be doubted that there is a well
defined conviction in the minds of many
of the most honest and intelligent people
of Ban Francisco that a new charter is a
crave and pressing necessity to this City.
The cumbersome and involved condition
of its present organic law has largely pro
duced this conviction. It cannot be ques
tioned that a city can be more easily and
economically governed under a law which
is compact, clear and complete in a 6ingie
document than under one as much scat
tered and as little systemized as is our
present organic law. A deference to this
sentiment will certainly lead to the adop
tion of a new charter for San Francisco at
no distant day, and it is more than uroba
ble that if the next proposed charter
is carefully prepared with an especial
view to the avoidance of objections which
have proven fatal to past oue9, it will be
adopted by our people. Its preparation,
however, should not be entrusted to mere
theorists or idealists upori the subject of
city government. Neither should the
work of its formation be hastily entered
upon or prosecuted while a fever of par
tisan politics is abroad in the land. In
short, the work of charter-making should
not be undertaken with any view of party
advantage nor with the idea of either
keeping in or turning out of office any
particular man or set of men. It would
furthermore be wiser to wait until the
Legislature has adjourned before actually
entering upon the work, in order that its
provisions may in nowise conflict with
prospective laws.
These considerations in favor of a wise
delay of the actual task of framing a new
charter in nowise militate against the
advisability of present and continued dis
cussion as to what it should contain. The
suggested meetings for the purposs of
charter discussion should be encouraged,
and when sach meetings are held they
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1896.
should be largely attended by those of our
citizens to whom we are accustomed and
entitled to look for wise and practical sug
gestions along the line of good govern
ment. From such preliminary considera
tion of the subject a double benefit is
bound to come, in that thoso who shall
finally be selected to prepare the charter
will be fully advised as to what it should
contain in order to be assured o( adoption ;
while those who are to pass upon it will
be educated in advance concerning the
merits of the measure, foÂ» the adoption of
which they will be expected to vote.
THE REVITAL OF BUSINESS.
The events of the past week have fully
justified the hopes of those who expected
an immediate revival of business to result
from the election of McKinley and Ho
bart. Every day has brought news of ad
ditional mills opening their doors to
labor, of new enterprises undertaken and
of an expansion of trade in every line of
industry.
The renewal of activity has been greater
than even tbe most sanguine expected. It
was believed by many that the recovery
from the Cleveland depression would be
slow, and that, while public confidence
would be restored by the election of Mc-
Kinley, the restoration of business activity
would be a gradual process Â«f recupera
tion rather than a sudden awakening into
a new life.
The splendid showing of the first week
following the election is most gratifying
to all who know how great is the need of
providing work lor American labor dur
ing the coming winter. It gives reason
for believing, as well as hoping, that we
will need this year fewer free-soup
kitchens than we have bed for stveral
years, because th to will be more open
mills to provide good wages for the indus
trious. Bnsiness is better than charity;
work is superior to dependence.
How different is the outlook which fol
lows the Republican victory from that
which resulted from the election of Cleve
land! At this season four years ago the
fear of the impending crisis was felt in
every trade in every section of the Union.
To-day a cheerful, hopeful feeling ani
mates every mind, and the realization of
better times seems within reach of all.
Capital comes forth from its hiding
place, every employer look 3 with hope to
the future, labor sees before it increasing
opportunities for work, every home has a
promise of new comfort, every com
munity tha r>ro*pect of a fuller industrial
development, and the whole Nation the
assurance of a prosperity even greater
than that which rejoiced its people under
the administration of Harrison.
For California the promise of the week
has been more plowing even than for her
sister States. The miners' convention
was a manifestation of such hopefulness
and energy on the part of tne managers of
our great mining industry tbat it infused
a new courage into all classes of citizens.
We may now look ior the beginning of all
forms of public and private enterprises
and improvements. Mines will be opened,
mills established, railroads constructed,
orchards planted, factories started, stores
built and homes erected.
Propitious omens for every industry
and almost for every individual can thus
be drawn from the occurrences of the
week. It looks now as if the recovery
would be like the sudden awakening in
the enchanted palace when Prince Charm
ing laid that kiss upon the lips of the
sleeping beauty, which awoke to life,
activity and joy all the energies which
had been rendered dormant by tbe spell
of the evil curse.
THE CUBAN QUESTION.
The near approach of the accession to
office of the new administration in this
country eives renewed interest to the
Cuban question. The people have almost
ceased to expect any action concerning
this issue from Mr. Cleveland, but as a
more vi.orous government will follow the
inauguration of President McKinley there
is reason to exDect something will then be
done to put an end to the long protracted
war in the island.
The situation at present is well nigh un
bearable. The people of this country
thoroughly sympathize with the Cubans
in their desire for independence. This
feeling is fed from a double source. In the
first place our people are naturally in
clined to side with those who are strug
gling for independence. A brave war for
liberty appeals strongly to the instincts of
the American heart, and the Cubans have
certainly fought this war with a bravery
and endurance which command the ad
miration of all.
The second cause for American sym
pathy with Cuba js not less potent than
the first. The island of Cuba is a part of
the American hemisphere. It ought to
share in American independence. If the
Spanish Government were conducted in j
that island only as a matter of form, as is !
the British Government in Canada, there
would be Jittle objection to it on the part
of our people. Spain, however, governs
Cuba not ihrough the Cubans themselves, j
but from her own far-off capital. At best
her administration of tho affairs of the
island is the complete domination of a
part of the American hemisphere by a
European government. At the present
time, moreover, the domination amounts
to an absolute military despotism, and is
accompanied by a degree of cruelty
airainst which the manhood and humanity
of the civilized world revolts.
An interference in the island by the
United States Government would hardly
result in war. Our military strength so
far outstrips that of Spain as to render
any resistance on her part useless. Even
in naval strength we are too far her supe
rior for her to engage in a contest with us.
A table recently published of the com
parative naval strength of the great na
tions of the earth credits the United States
with the power equal to ten, while that of
Spain is only about four. We would of
course increase our naval strength with
rapidity, while Spain could not increase
hers at all. v
Under these circumstances the country
will await with some eagerness to see
whether Mr. Cleveland suggests any move
in regard to Cuba in his coming message.
Not much is expected of him, but the
force of the Venezuelan message shows
that his Secretary of State, Mr. Olney, is
â¦capable of vigorous action on occasions.
If Cleveland does nothing there will be all
the more eagerness for the accession of
President McKinley.
The Cuban war has been protracted too
long, and it is time the American Govern
ment should interfere far enough at least
to put an end to hostilities and compel a
settlement of the long controversy by
peaceful means.
THE WAYS OF THE AIR.
The science of meteorology yields prece
dence only to that of electricity in the
progress made in the last quarter of a cen
tury. It has rapidly become a very useful
science in making weather-forecasting a
practical success, and is therefore of vast
utility to commerce and general indus
tries. The weather prophet had his day
In a more credulous age; he was later re
pudiated and laughed into silence; now
he has come back to stay and has honor
even in his own country.
The completeness of oar telegraph sys
tem, extending over so great a reach of the
earth's surface, has enabled students of
meteorology to make such comprehensive
observations of the air as to find the uni
form laws which control its movements.
Although the United States was not the
first country to establish a weather service
system, our scientists have taken tbe lead
in investigating the nature of storms and
making it clear that weather predictions
could be made so certain as to be of im
mense practical value.
In a recent address delivered in Wash
ington, Professor W. L. Moore, chief of the
Weather Bureau, tells some things about
the weather and the ways of the air not
generally understood by the public. In
fact, bis information is in direct contra
diction to what we used to be taught on
the subject. Tbe old idea of great currents
of air flowing like rivers, or ocean streams,
and bringing coolness or cola from their
far passage over ice and snow, he says, is
incorrect.
High and low pressure areas drift
across the country from the west eastward
at the rate of about 600 miles daily. The
high pressures draw down by the
peculiar vertcal action of their centers
the cold air from greaC altitudes, and this
current from far above us spreads out in
all directions from the center. The pro
fessor says that, though the air extends
for fifty miles up, half its mass Ites below
the three-mile level. The air above six
miles flows continuously eastward with
out being interrupted by our most severe
storms. A storm that reaches half way
across the continent horizontally is only
four or five miles high.
Cyclones and tornadoes are often con
fused in general conception and popular
speech, but Professor Moore gives ttieir
definitions and the distinctions between
them. "The whole disk of whirling air,
four or five miles thick and 1500 miles in
diameter, is called a cyclone. The tornado
is a revolving mass of air of only 500 to
1000 yards in diameter, and is simply an
incident of the cyclone. The cyclone may
cause moderate or high winds through a
vast extent of territory, while the tornado
with a rotary motion almost immeas
urable always leaves a trail of death and
destruction."
Another way in which the professor's
learning contradicts a widely diffused no
tion is in the denial that the cutting away
or planting of trees, the stretching of
electric wires across the country, the lay
ing of great bands ol" steel rails, has any
effect upon climate. He says we might as
well try to dam tbe Mississippi with a
pebble as to expect to change, by the
feeble efforts of man, the vast forces
which control our storm* and climate.

SURE AIM WITH BIG GUNS.
Extraordinary Ixstrcml-.vt Invented by a
French Artillery Officer.
An extraordinary instrument, called the
phonotelemeter watch, has just been invented
by Captain Thouvenin of the French artillery.
This watch, says the Herald, measures dis
tance by the velocUy of sound, and though it
was primarily conceived with the idea of se
curing accuracy of aim in pointing big guns,
it will be Invaluable to staff officers for the
purpose of measuring distances on maps, very
useful to topography, and may render great
tervice to mere tourists, as will be seen from
the following details.
It is not easy to judge of distance on land.
At sea only the very experienced mariner can
estimate with anything approaching accuracy,
if it be in any way considerable, the distance
separating his own yes sel from a passing ship
or from a given point of land, and the chÃnces
are that even he nine times out of ten will be
wrone in his cal cuiations.
By Captain Thou venin's invention, however,
this element of uncertaintye rtainty will be done away
with In the future, both on land and sea,
whether by night or day, and the artillery
Phonotelemeter "Watch.
officer will be able to order the elevation or de
pression of his guns to the correct degree by
the indications of the watch, which is so
small that it can becariied in the waistcoat
pocket like an ordinary timepiece.
Holding the instrument in bis left hand^tbe
officer watches for the flash of the enemy's
rifle or cannon. Immediately he perceives
the light he presses a screw, which resembles
that of a keyless watch. When he hears the
report he presses the screw a second time. In
the interval between the two pressures a
needle or hand has moved over an arc on the
face of the instrument. This face registers
fifteen seconds, each second beingdivide 1 into
ten pans. There is, moreover, a small dial on
the back, which registers the number of times
that the needle has gone round and marks in
stantaneously the minutes and quarter min
utes.
Within the circle of seconds is a smaller
one, which indicates the distance covered by
the sound through the air. The approximate
distance at which the weapon was fired is
thus seen at â¢ glance. The same thing hap
pens in the case of a Hash of lightning which
precedes a clnp of thunder.
The graduation is easily made. The velocity
of light is 300,000 kilometers a second. This
is the number most nearly concording from
astronomical and direct physical methods.
During the same lapse of time sound travels
330 meters, a velocity of about a million times
less man that of light. The propagation of
light is practically instantaneous.
With this knowledge, and knowing the time
that elapses betore the sound is heard, it is
easy to calculate the distance at which the re
port originated.
This discovery was made in 1822, when sev
eral French academicians measured at Ville
jutf and Montlbery the time between the mo
ment they perceived the flash of a gun fired
Irom thj opposite fort and the moment the
sound of the report reached their curs. Know
ing the distance between the two placesâ
twenty-two kilometersâ they merely had to de
duct tne velocity of the sound.
The value of Captain Tuouvenln's invention
to an army using it in time ol war is obvious
to any one. Very much must depena in these
days of appallingly destructive long-distance
weapons, a single discharge from which may
wipe a whole regiment out of existence, upon
getting the guns to do effective work quicker
than the enemy is able to do. It is conceded
that the great wars of the future will be
mainly duels between artillery. The phono
telemeter watch will enable commanders of
batteries to promptly concentrate their fire
without having to experiment to find a range,
as in times past. This enormous advantage
might be sufficient to deride a battle.
In the event of a night attack by infantry
the new Instrument will enable the defending
machine-guns to vomit their ceaseless hail of
project! es upon the exact spot from whicu the
enemy's rifle-firing begins and to keep the
raugo upon the advancing regiments, so that
every turn of a crauk will put many men hors
de combat.
At sen. when battle-ships moving at full
speed offer a difficult target to each other, a
vessel steaming parallel with another in me
same direction and having the distance be
tween them exactly indicated at the outset of
the engagement may be able to concentrate
her whole broadside with unerring aim and
sink the hostile ship before the latter can find
the range, or at lenst inflict such damage upon
her as to place her in a position of hopeless
inferiority.
The phonotelcmeter will also be of the ut
most value at the coastguard and lifeboat sta
tions in case of vessels in distress firing signal
guvs for help, and may be the means of saving
innumerable lives. The men who work the
rocket apparatus frequently fail to judge the
distance between them and a ship in distress,
and in consequence the line falls short. The
inventor of the new instrument for judging
distances claims that it can gauge distance so
closely that the men engaged in saying the
liveÃ of wrecked mariners will know just how
far to throw the lite line at the first cast.
LADY'S LOSTUME
Skirts and waists of different fabrics but of
one color are extremely stylish. The one
shown above was of dark blue, the skirt being
of lady's jelotta, the waist corded of silk of the
same color, trimmed with jet laid over white
satin. The collar and belt were of black satin.
A dress of wool in a mixture of several col
on, in which tiny dashes of cherry appeared
at intervals, had the Bolero effect in cherry
colored velvet, bordered with braiding in
black soutache brnld. A collar and belt of
black satin were worn with this smart cos
tume.
The skirt Is cut with a circular front and
sides and two gores in the back.
CURIOUS ELECTRICAL FIRES.
Several fires of very queer origin are de
tailed below from the quarterly report of the
Electrical Bureau of the National Board of
Fire Underwriters, all attributed to electricity:
A plush curtain In a theater, on being
hoisted, came in contact with a thirty-two
candle-power incandescent lamp. The com
mon size is sixteen candle-power. The heat
from the lamp Ignited the curtain, but the fire
was discovered, with no loss except the cur
tain.
A stage hand was ordered to turn out an In
candescent lamp, and, not knowing how to do
it, instead of turning the switch he wraDped a
i damp towel around the lamp. Some time ]
afterward the towel was discovered smulder
iii g.
A portable incandescent lamp was allowed
to remain lighted lying on a mattress. Ihe
heat from the lamp ignited the cloth and ex
celsior of the mattress and the fire spread
through basement and store.
An electric pressing iron %vas allowed to
stand with the current turned on. The heaU-d
Iron after a time set fire to the table and the
flames communicated to the surrounding com
bustible material. ,â. . ...
A wagon loaded with gasoline collided with
an electric-par. The wagon was demolished
and the oil flooded the sireet. The accident
attracted the attention of a motorman oi an
other car, who ran his car up to the scene.
Seeing the oil running underhiscar he turned
on the current to get away. A spark from the
wheel immediately ignited the gasoline fumes
and Instantly the street was ablaze, tour
people were injured, one seriously, and one
horse was burned to death.
Kire occurred in a basement owing to drip
ping water filling on an electrical measuring
instrument, thereby short-circuiting it. .No
damage was done beyond the loss of the in
strument.
Spams from arc lamps in an apartment
store ignited cloaks on a table nnderneatn.
An elevator motor was burned out, having
been left running when the employes left the
store, the motor brushes being badly adiusted.
A carpenter dropped a nut on the coils ot a
rheostat, short-circuiting them with an iron
frame resting against a gaspipe. An arc was
formed between the frame and the pipe, the
latter was melted and the escaping gas ig
nited. Jtut small loss.
Rau gnawed the insulation from a wire
which lay on a gaspipe, an arc was established
between the wire and tne gaspipe, setting fire
to the gas. ___________ __

Large Sum of 860,000.
Judge Belcher has ordered that W. E.
Pauisell be admitted to bail in the sum of
?60,000. The court added a rider to the
effect that the bond should not be passed
on by any other Judge.
Paulseli was convicted of robbing a faro
game of about $5000 and was sentenced to
ten years in the State Prison.
A new trial was granted by the Supreme
Court ou the ground that Judge Belcher
had erred in regard to the admission and
exclusion of certain testimony, but the
point on which special stress was laid by
Paulsell's attorney was that Judge Belcher
had departed from the usual form in de
fining "reasonable doubt." His Honor
added to the regulation, definition a lew
words of his own, in which he said that
jurors are allowed "to exercise common
sense" in arriving at their decision as to
the guilt or innocence of the prisoner.
To this Dhraso the Supreme Court en- â 
tered objection, holding that it was not
necessary and saying that the appellate
court of this State does not sanction a
departure from the form that has been
accepted so long by the courts of the
country.
It is expected that Pauisell will offer his
bonds to-morrow or next day.

ft Qervius SloW to Mature â Originally Intended for the Ghurch. fater
Drifted y\Wavj From Ghristiarv to fagan Ideals and
Became an /\rdent Platonist
It is more-than two years since Walter Pater
â¢ was laid under English earth. Even in writ
ing the words one recalls the admonitions of
old Socrates, who reproved that disciple who
asked him where he wished to be buried. The
master, as ho was about to drink the cup of
â¢â¢ hemlock, answered that not he but his body
â was to be committed to earth, and added: "Be
well assured, most excellent Crlto, that to
speak improperly is not only culpable as to I
the thing itself, but likewise occasions some |
injury to our souls." And *d, even at the mo
ment of death, he asserted his own immortal
ity and made his protest against a careless use
of worcs. And truly, words in composition
are many times like mighty forces in weak
hands, arid are so used that the virtue and
power are lost out of them.
So then it is two years since Walter Pater's
boiy was faid under English earth, and
though the love and appreciation of his works
have steadily increased among all book
lovers, strangely little has been known about
the man himself.
He was alooi in body and mind from most cf
his generation. He was in no sense of the
word, nor can he ever be, a popular writer.
People are in too great a hurry tc-day to
linger over those subtleties of expression that
convey meanings which Pater alone could im
part and which are as elusive as the fragrance
of- a flower or a suggested strain of music.
Though it is safe enough to predict that the
"Pater erase" which has prevailed in the East
ern cities will reach the Pacific Coast before
.. long, true Pater lovers will always be rare.
When Pater aied the utual press sketches and
reviews were lacking. Yet he and Stevenson
â¢were ranked together by critics as the two
great masters of style in their generation.
The contrast between the silence which greeted
the one man's death and the world's praise
which blossomed over the grave ot the other
â¢was singularly striking. The reason lay prob
ably in the different personality of the men.
Pater Has reserved. Save to his few friends
he lacked the genial kindliness which marked
â¢ Stevenson as a man and es a writer.
Yet in the writings of Pater his readers find
an ever-increasing charm. His work fulfills
tha*. most difficult requirement of true art,
the possession of a perpetually increasing in
terest, and so in Pater the student finds con
stantly new beauties, new fascinations.
It was not until the publication of Mr.
Gossc's recent book that anything like a sat
isfactory biographical sketch of Pater hes
been giveu us; though I recollect an article
in tne Atlantic by William Sharp, in which
he speaks ot his first meeting with Pater and
the rare attraction (so rarely exerted) of the
man for his friends. The meeting happened
in the following way: Sharp, then a young
â¢ ' man and shy â a half-fledged criticâ was on his
first visit to London. He was taken by the
blind poet Philip Bourke Marston to call at
the home of the Robinsons, where those two
talented sisters â one of whom afterward be
â¢ 'came Mme. Darmesteter â had one of the
most brilliant coteries in London about them.
A number of gueEts were in the drawing-room
when the two friends arrived; among the rest
a quiet, dark man of medium height, stoutly
built, standing near the piano.
The pallor ot his face was intensified by a
heavy black mustache his eyes were deep-
Bet, of a peculiar grayâ : 'A variable hue, but
.wherein the inner light was always vivid and
sometimes strangely keen and penetrating."
The young Scotchman was quite thrilled upon
â¢ being told that this was Walter Pater. We
may suppose that the older man was touched
by the lad's very evident admiration, for thia
v.as the beginning of a hie-long friendship.
William Sharp was a frequent visitor in aiter
years at Pater's quiet Oxford home, which
was presided over by his sisters.
Mr. Gosse, in his "portrait" of Pater, tells us
that his family was of Dutch extraction, his
ancestors having come over with William of
â ' Orange. They were clannish and tenacious
of family traditions. For generations the sons
* 'were reared in the church of Rome and the
daughters in the Anglican faith. Walter, who
was Lorn in 1839, and his brother William
were the first Paters who were not brought up
Catholics. Walter was not at all precocious
and showed no unusual ability as a schoolboy.
At college be gained only a second class and
. his degree was a sore disappointment. Jowett
â was apparently the only man in Oxford who
discerned his ability. He surprised Pater very
much one day by saying: "I think you have a
mind which will come to great eminence."'
His genius matured slowly. He was 27 be
fore be ventured into print. It was ttieii that
he puDlished his fragmentary essay on Cole
ridge, which gave little indication of the dis
tinguished character of the work that was to
. follow. The following year, Having come
under the influence of German culture, he
wrote his famous essay on Winckelmannâ that
.'. Winckelmaun to whom Goethe paid so high a
tribuie and who was the father of the Greek
revival in Germany. Gosse says of Pater that
â¢ "it was with the study of Winckelmann that
he became himself a writer." Originally de
, signed for the church he gradually drif tea away
from Christian to pagan ideals. He became
' an ardent Platonist and a lover of Greek art.
He was in sympathy with the pre-Raphaeliie
movement, and had a great admiration for
the then little known work of Edward Burne-
Jones. He became intimate with Swinburne,
and the young poet was a frequent visitor in
Pater's college rooms. That was "the time of
singing birds," when Christina and Dante
Gabriel Rossetti and Morris and Swinburne
were pouring forth their song.
Pater resolved to write prose no less ex
quisite than their poetry. He was extremely
painstaking. Gosse says, "I have known
writers of every degree, but never one to
whom the act of composition was such a
travail and an agony as it was to Pater."
With increasing fame he became more â
though still discriminatinglyâ sociable. He
entertained only those people whose lives
touched his at some point of interest. Miss
Mary Arnold, who afterward became Mrs.
Humphry Ward, was one of these. Indeed
her girl's privilege of friendship with eminent
men, and being niece to an illustrious uncle,
must have gone far toward making her the
writer she has since become. Pater was kind
and considerate, though always somewhat
reserved in his attitude toward the young
men of Oxford, to whom hiÂ« was a figure of
constantly increasing interest. He died on
the 30th of July, 1894, in the fifty-fifth year of
his age. The work that he left is small in
quantity; not more than five or six volumes.
Such finish as his could not go with rapid
workmanship. "Marius, the Epicurean," is
a psychological, semi-historic romance of pa
gan times. It is hiÃ only work of fiction,
unless "The Imaginary Portraits" could be
classed as such. It is called a great book by
critics who are chary in their use of that ad
jective. It is very long and is the most marked
example of his introspective, analytical style.
So that it Is not the best first attempt for be
ginners in Pater. Nevertheless, no other book
, has so completely given ua the spirit
L of the pagan world. We touch here
upon the thoughts, the feelings, the
aspirations of the men of that time; upon
their dim gropirigs after the abstract truth in
the midst of a life which is wholly dependent
â upon the outward expression of things, which
so clung to what was evident and tangible to
the senses. The melancholy of that time
when the old gods were lading away and the
new was as yet for all what he still is for most
the unknown goa, is apparent in Pater's own
Hie. In "The Cluic in the House," that imag- <
mary portrait into which he put so much of
his own childhood, he says became more and
more to be unable to care for or think of soul
but as in an actual body, or of any world but
that wherein there are water and trees and
where men end women look so and so and
press actual hands." In this he was very like
Rossetti. In fact much of what Pater says of
Rostetti in his essay on the poet and painter
might be applied with equal truth to Pater
himself.
' His other volumes are: "Renaissance
Studies," "Appreciations, With an Essay on
Style." "Imaginary Portraits," "Plato and
Platonism" and -Greek Studies." In the
first volume is that marvelous description of
Leonardo's "Lisa," the beauty of which a keen
art critic confesses impressed him more pow
erfully than the beauty of the picture itself.
The description, every word of which is like a
bit of mosaic fitted into its exact place, is too
long for quotation in full, and yet it loses by
the omission of a single part.
It begins: "We all know the face and hands
of that figure. Set in its marble chÃir in that
cirque of fantastic rocks, as in some faint
light under sea." And tlieu the word artist
gueK on to speak of the "unfathomable smile,
always with a touch of something sinister in
it, which characterizes all Leonard's work."
And again, "The presence that there so
strangely rose beside the waters is expressive
of what, in the ways of a thousand years, man
had come to desire. â¢ â¢ * It is a beauty
wrought out from within upon the flesh, the
deposit, iittle cell by cell, of strange thoughts
and fantastic reverie ana exquisite passions.
bet it for one moment beside one of those
white Greek goddesses and how would they be
troubled by thi& beauty, iuto which the soul
with all its maladies has passed. All the
thoughts and experiences of the world have
etched and molded there, in that which they
have of power to reline and make ex
pressive the outward form; the animalism of
Greece, the lust of Rome, the reverie of the
middle age with its spiritual ambitions and
imaginative loves, the return of the pagan
world, the sins of the Borgias."
This is but a part and the whole must be
read, and more than once, to gain its full
beauty and significance. Then and not till
then the splendor and cadence of the wo'Js
set the blood dancing in the veins as certain
poems are wont to do. Who, then, can forget
that beauty "into which the soul with all its
maladies has passed"? Who can foreet that
"reverie of the middle age, with its spiritual
ambitions and imaginative loves"? Was ever
a time so completely characterized by a single
phrase?
â¢â Appreciations" contains nine essay?, most
of them on English writers, tour "Imaginary
Portraits" are usually published in one vol
ume, though in the latest edition "The Child
In the House," which was published after
Pater's death, is added. The others are "A
Prince of Court Painters," "Denys L'Auxer
rois," Sebastian yon Storck" and "Duke Carl
of Rosenmould." The first is v picture of
Anthony Watteau. Whether real as to facts or
fanciiul, it is true in the sense George Eliot
meant when she said that fiction is truer than
history. If any can read it ana not feel that
they have been made to understand the spirit
of that dainty and exquisite brush, the fault
lies in themselves but not in Pater.
The man and his time are illuminated. One
can never see a Watteau fan or shepherdess,
again without a peculiar feeling of intimacy
and tenderness for the painter. We under
standthis motives. Wa see what he really
meant when he painted his artificial little
men and women. We see that the airy grace
and charm did not just happen, but came
from a deeper sense back of the convention.
And the beautiful, unselfish, high-Dred girl of
nearly two centuries ago, who loved him Bnd
wrote of him in her journal â did she really
live and did her life pass quietly sad. and gray
and unfulfilled? She lives to us who read of
her at least. We know that he too loved her,
but turned away toothermodesof thought and
feeling, as men can, while she was left behind,
between the old dead walls of familiar habit,
with no outlook but the sky above.
"Sebastian yon Storck" is one of the subtlest
psychological studies in all the world of
primed words. It is a picture as fine as a
cameo.
The portrayal of the yonng man's character
and the effect upon it of purely abstract ppecu
lations shows Pater's conception of what must
result from the loss of the tangible. Richard
Le Gallienne says that "Sebastian was hypno
tized by the universe."
Those who are interested in the beginnings
of German culture will read "DuJre Carl" with
special pleasure.
The chief value of these "portraits" is the
quality they possess of imparting the very es
sence of the flavor of the time and place in
which they are set. For those who seek the
broader culture, which carries from compre
hending many modes of thought and from
living the life of many times and peoples,
Pater has done a lasting service. And for those
whose ears are attuned to perceive the music
in words, which is as much a gift or a faculty
as the ability to perceive the music in tones,
Walter Pater will ever have a rare and inex
pressible charm. Grace S. Musser.

A NEW LOVE STORY.
WON VS DEK PROTEST. By Cellft E. Gardner.
New York: G. W. Dlllingham Campanr. For
sale by the San Francisco News company, Poit
street; price (1 60.
This is a story as far removed from t*hc sensa
tional as possible, yet in matter as well as
style possesses a fascination which will recom
mend it to the general novel-render.
It nas no mission save to amuse; professes |
to be nothing more than a simple love story;
is in fact not much more than a study of a
woman's heart â that of one who having loved
in her early womanhood with the love of a
lifetime, and Dcen disappointed, has fouglit
herself iuto calmness; the bitter experience
leaving, however, fo lasting an impression as
to make her resolve never again to give hei
happiness and peace of mind into the keep
ing of any man.
After a lapse of ten years, her home being
broken up by the death of her mother, she
goes to a distant town to reside with au only
sister, where, to her annoyance and conster
nation, she finds her old iorc, who has mar
ried immediately after the broken engage
ment, established with his wife as the near
neighbor and intimate friend of the family
with whom she has come to dwell. The strug
gle to live her life Inconstant association with
those who have done oo much to wreck its
happiness, and keep her heart free from the
old thralldom, both before and after the wife
obligingly takes her departure to another
world, forms the subject of the story.
When in due time her hand is sought in
marriage by her old lover, she is still m> re
luctant to put herself in the bondage of pas
sion, while confessing her ability to love him,
and only him, and so assured that a marriage
between them would not result in happiness
for either, that she gives him his conge in a
letter that is perhaps the finest bit in the book.
This, however, he refuses to accept as final,
an<l after a year's probation she is at last, in
spite of continued misgivings, "Won Under
Protest"
The story is told in the first person, the tone
is high and pure, the characterization goo.,
the dialogue bright and natural; and though,
if it were true, such a revelation of the work
ings of a woman's heart might be in question
able taste, it being in all probability merely
fiction, will escape that form of criticism.

This is a mystic slory, embellished with

The twin sister of Ynys, Annaik, also loves

to fight poverty in a cheap flat. The story is a
stronger one than the famous "Dodo." In a
talk about the temptatious of college life Tom
Carlincford, the hero, declares that there are
no temptations in college life except to sleep
late in the morning. One of the fine passages
is where Tom's father tells him that leaving
religion altogether out of the question immor
ality is the most supreme folly. The story is
not a very cheerfu> one, as it calls attention
to the grinding of circumstances which com
pel men often to give up their ideals.
ANGLO-SAXON UNITY DESIRED.
WHY AMERICANS DISLIKE ENfiLAKD.
By George Burton Adams. Philadelphia: Henry
Altemus, publisher; price 30 cents.
This essay is the expansion of an article
which appeared in the New York Independent
of January 2, 1896. The reason given for the
dislike is the popular belief in America that
In every emergency with which the United
States has been confronted the British Gov
ernment has been our enemy. It rests largely
tfith England to remove the grounds of such
belief. "As for ourselves, in the narrower
sense," concludes the author, l it is no doubt
true that, in any possible future, our position
is far more secure than that of England, and j
yet it is certain that our own best and highest
interests, and" those of all men everywhere,
demand the uuity and common action of the
Anglo-Saxon race."

he persuades himself as well as her that she
has a promising talent. She is undeceived by
the frank criticism of an author named Otway.
She learns that this man is right by his select

fizv) Had a JReVolutionarvj " Tea Party " of ]\zv OWn and
Shed the First Blood of the War for /American
Independence.
REMINISCENCES OF AN OCTOGENARIAN".
By Ctiarles H. Haswell. Harper & Bros. For
saie by A. M. Robertson, City. Price $3.
The book covers the period between 1816
and 1860. The author is the compiler of the
well-known civil engineers' and machinists'
manual called "Haswell." It contains many
interesting memories of the metropolis. The
writer starts out by surprising us With a tale
of the "New York Tea-Party ," which destroys
Boston's monopoly of fame on that line. The
New York party, without the cover of Indian
disguise, sent one of the tea ships back to
England and upset the cargo of another into
the bay. He also claims for New York the
distinction of having shed the first blood of
the Revolution. This was at the battle of
Golden Hill, which was two months earlier
than the Boston massacre.
Among the honors claimed for the city are
that it was the scene of the first victorious
fight for the liberty of the press, the birth
place of the Sons of Liberty, organized to re
sist the stamp act, and ten years before the
revolution it was the meeting place of the first
American Congress of nine colonies.
A few samples of the interesting reminis
cences of old New York, culled at random
from the book's pages, will give some idea of
its historic treasures. The story is told of how
Mrs. Murray's excellent Madeira, by detaining
General Howe in the eDjoyment of her hospi
tality at a critical time, saved the Revolution
ary army from capture in New York. An
amusing story is told of the first attempt to in
troduce anthracite coal. It was mined in
Rhode Island, and samples were distributed
among well-known citizens to test and report
on its merits. One of them, Martin S. Wilkins,
made the following report: "I am willing to
certify that, under favorable circumstances,
this coal is capable of ignition, and I am will
ing to further certify that, if Rnode Island is
underlaid with such coal, then, at the general
conflagration which our ministers predict, It
will be the last place to burn."
It is related that as late as 1838 hair on the
face was so much disapproved of that when
Consul Glldden returned from Egypt one of
his commentators wound up his praise with
the remark, "What a pity he should wear a
I mustache." In 1816 a beard was such a rarity
that the wearer would attract attention as a
curiosity and be followed down the street by a
crowd of boys. Even in 1850 the writer avers
that he heard mustaches termed "mon
strous" by persons of taste, culture and sober
judgment.
In 1825 it was officially estimated that
20,000 hogs were at large on the streets of
New York. The year 1821 was a time of
very rapid building, and on the present
corner of Hammond and Fourth streets
corn was growing on a Saturday ana the
next Monday one Sykes had completed a
house there big enough to accommodate 300
boarders. On April 20, 1831, William
C. Bryant, who was then editor ot the Even
ing Post, had a rencounter with William
L. Stone of the Commercial and struck him
with a cowhide. Friends separated them, and
Stone triumphed to the extent of possessing
the whip after the battle. In 1829 Delnion
ico's name and address first appeared. The
broihers commenced in a single room at 23
William street, in which they and the female
members of the family dispensed coffee, cakes,
liquors and confections. In 1831 the first
street railroad â was put in operation. On Sep
tember 21, 1824, the Advocate, a lead
ing paper, published the fact, accompanied
with expressions of its disapprobation, that a
young man had been seen smoking on the
streets so ear'y as 9 o'clock in the morning.
It is astonishing to note that Mr. Ha&well
says that all men of -his age may look back to
the customs and conveniences of the past as
more rational, creditable and comfortable than
I many of the present time.
A HISTORICAL ROMANCE.
QUO VADIB. A Narrative of Rome of the Time
of Nero. By Henryfc sienkWvicr.. Author of
"With Fire and Sword," "The Deluge," "Pan
Michael." etc. Translated from the Polish by
Jeremiah I urtin. Crown, Bvo. Cloth, 92. Lit
tle, Brown Â«fc Co., Boston.
This is a beautifully written historical ro
mauce, which brings vividly before the reader's
imagination the cruel days of old Rome and
the terrible ordeals triumphantly borne to
which the early Christians were subjected.
The chief interest of the story lies in the grad
ual conversion of Vicinius, a luxurious and
profligateÃomau.tothe new faith. Through the
Instrumentality of his ardent love for Lygia, a
Christian girl of such fresh loveliness that "be
neath a statue of this maiden one might write
'Spring,' " ho is drawn to the love and acoept-
ance of Christ. Lygia is the daughter of the
King of the Suevi, and had been sent to Rome
as a hostage. Vicinius attempted to get pos
session of her by force, but Is baffled in this
method and compelled to woo her like a
Christian should. He is dangerously wounded
and nursed back to li c by the faithful tend
ance of the woman he wishes. Surrounded by
Christians be begins to admire the magna
nimity which forgave his attempted wrong in
seeking to snatch instead of pleading
for his desire. His love for Lygia grew witn
the difficulty of gaining her. From his sick
bed "he looked at her profile, at her drooping
lashes, at her hands lying on her knees; and
in his pagan head the idea began to hatch
with difficulty, that at the side of naked
beauty, confident, and proud of Greek and
Roman symmetry, there is another in the
world, new, immensely pure, in which a soul
resides."
Saint Peter and Paul of Tarsus are intro
duced into the narrative, and y in an interview
with them Vicinius says "your virtue and
your religion, though I do not profess it, have
changed something in my soul, so that I do
not venture on violence. Give Lygia to me as
wife, and I swear that not only will I not for
bid her to profess Christ, but I will begin my
self to learn his religion." He learns and
wins. At the end of the story a letter to a
friend tells that he is sitting in the shade of an
almond tree with his wife beside him spinning
wooL
There is a long and fine description of the
conflagration of Rome when it seemed to Vi
cinius that not the city only but the whole
world was burnine.
Among the book's attractions la a sermon by
St. Peter. There is a lesson in loving in the
letter of Petronius to his friend Vicinius. The
character of Nero 1b finely drawn, and one of
fine touch is where Poppoea's management of
the tyrant is partly accounted for, because she
knew "that Nero may be blamed on condition
that to a small criticism a great flattery be
added." ..
The end is a dramatic description of the
death of the cruel and cowardly Emperor.
Those readers who have enjoyed Canon Far
rar's "Darkness and Dawn" will find a similar
pleasure in this tale of a gleam of light in the
darcness.
TALES FROM THE FRENCH
TALK 1 * FROM A MOTHER-OF-PEARL
CASKET. By Anatole France. Geonce Rich
mond <& Co., New York. For sale at all book
stores. Price Si.
This is a collection of short stories by Ana
tole Prance, translated by Henri Pene dv Bois.
M. France was for some years a journalist en
gaged in contributing critical articles to La
Vie Litteraire, Le Globe. Les Debats and Le
Temps. fj. He is j mainly , recognized, ,' however,
by his novel, published lin 1881, entitled "Le
Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard."
M, dv Boi3, speaking of the author ol tire
present sketches, says: '"He is a book-lover,
he is youne, he is a philosopher, he is very
learned and he knows men. There were never
qualities more difficult to reunite in ouu per
son; there was never an artist more skill
ful at using their combination than Anatole
France. In this book, a cycle of human
progress is inclosed. There are in it the end
of paganism and the end of the monarchy in
France. There are in it the naive ways of the
saints of the Golden Legend and those of the
revolutionists at the end of the eighteenth
century. There are in it tolerance, sympathy,
iutelllgenca and faultless artifice." All of
which may be true, but the sketches appear to
havo ratner tnat quality of making themselves
acceptable to the Parisian feuilleton devourer
than to the average American reader of short
stories. That, however, Is not the fault of the
translator, who appears to have performed a
difficult tusk in a creditable manner.
A FIIJE CHEAP EDITION.
FATHER STAFFORD. By Anthony Hope.
Mew York: P. Tennyson Neely, publlsuer. For
sUe by Emporium Book Department; cloth
price 75 cents.
The appearance on the local stage with at
tendant success of the dramatized version of
"The Prisoner of Zenda" has served to create
a livelier Interest in the writings of Anthony
Hope. The edition of that masterful author's
late book, "Father Stafford," now at hand, is
at the same time cheap and elegant. The
story, it need hardly be repeated, Is one of
Mr. Hope's strongest, vividly portraying the
strife between the obligation of a vow of
celibacy and the promptings of true love.
LITERARY NOTES.
Jules Verne has been sued by a man who
claims $10,000 damages for being introduced
as one of the characters in his new novel.
Cape Cod folks, as a rule, will sympatiiiza
with him.
A list of the private libraries in the world,
with a description of their contents, is about
to be published in Leipzig. The first part de

William Allen White's book of Kansas stor
ies, " The Real Issue," is announced for pub
lication by Way & Williams ou November 15.
Mr. White's editorial, "What's Wrong With
Kansas?" which was reprinted from his paper,
the Emporia (Kans.) Gazette, and used as a
campaign document, has already introduced
him to a large circle of readers. His stories
are original and sincere and Interesting.
T. Y. Crowell & Co. of New York and Boston
have republished in attractive form George
Sands' '-Fa'lette." "La Petite Fadette" was
written about the time of the Revolution of
1848 when the state of Europe seemed most
gloomy and uncertain. The gifted author set
herself to work to create a little circle of cheer,
[ a light in darkness. This charming story was
the result. The translation nas been done by
Mrs. James M. Lancaster, who has rendered
the author's French iuto unexceptional Eng
lish.
The value of the new "Century Science
Series" is more strongly marked with every
new volume which the Macmillan Company
publishes. In compact form most welcome to
those who havo not time to read long
biographies, they contain interesting
narratives of the lives of the men who
have done most to develop modern
sciences. The writer of each book is an
authority on the science whose history is
traced; for example, Sir Henry Roscoe writes
of "John Dalton and the Rise of Modern
Chemistry," R. T. Glazebroofc of "James Clark
Maxwell and Modern Physics" and Professor
Sylvanus P. Thompson is preparing "Michael
Faraday, His Life and Work." The most recent
issue is Edward B. Poulton's '-Charles Darwin
and the Theory of Natural Selection."
Outing for November is superbly illustrated
and contains the following excellent articles:
"Prominent Trotters and Pacers of the Sea
son," by E. S. Abercromble; "The Story of a
Penny Pencil" (complete), by Sarah Addison
Wedderburn; "In the City of the White Dove,"
by Annetta Halliday-Antona; "Over Decoys on
the Mississippi," by F. E. Kellogg; "The Canoe
Camp at Grindstone," by R. B. Bnrchard; "An
Adventure with African Lions," by Traher

"Racing Schooners," by R. B. Burchard; "Foot
ball of '96," by Walter Camp; and tho "Na
tional Guard ot Maine," by Captain C. B. Hall.
The editorial and record departments are very
interesting.
The Critic of October 31 contains a half
hundred book reviews, an account of the sos
quicentenary at Princeton, with a list of those
honored with degrees and portraits of five of
the six men of letters who received the title
of doctors of letters honoris causa (Professor
Baird, Richard Watson Gilder, Professors
Lounsbury and March and Messrs. Horace E.
Scudder and Charles Dudley Warner); a
view of George dv Maurier's new house at 17
Oxford Square. London, which he purchased
when "Trilby" had brought him wealth, only
to die there; a portrait of the late Cyrus W.
Field, accompanying a review of his daugh
ter's biography of him; and an interesting ac
count by Dr. Howard Horace Furness of "The
Town of Trilby," in Florida, which has been
named after Dv Maurier's heroine, and his its
streets, squares, etc., named alter the princi
pal characters of the novel.
Another book of which it is said that Us first
edition (in this case fifteen hundred) was sold
on the day of publication, is a volume of "Old
English Ballads," illustrated by George Whar
ton Edward?, with an introduction by Hamil
ton W. Mabie. Surely this is an instance to
comfort tbe hearts of those who croak that the
genuine love of literature is dying out,
for here we have simply the old familiar
ballads beginning with Chevy Cbace,
closing with Sir Patrick Spens, with Mr.
Mabie's scholarly introduction and ilr. Ed
wards' sympathetic artistic interpretation;
and the book receives such a reception as is
rarely granted to anything else than a new
book from that novelist who happens for the
tlmo being to lead in the scale of popularity.
The book referred to is one which collectors
will Boon value, and for these an edition on
laree paper has been specially prepared by tha
publishers, the Macmillan Company.
It is a little whimsical perhaps to assume
that Mrs. Mabel Osgood Wright, when she
gave the beast and bird characters in her new
story, "Tommy-Anne," their Indian names,
knew that the booK would come to the chil
dren on just such a perfect Indian summer
day as greeted its publication last week, but
certainly nothing could have been more fit
ting. It would seem that it was appreciated
also, for the first edition (not a specially
small one since the number of copies reached
more nearly two than the usual one thousand)
scarcely outlived the day of publication, and
a second is being prepared as rapidly as pos
sible. Such a report is precisely what one
would look for and quite in the line of the
expectation voiced by this month's bookman,
that the story would be "one of the most at
tractive books for children." It is published,
by the Macmillan Company,

FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO BE IN THE FASHION
At the last Grand Prix jackets and capes
were both in evidence. The dresses were
almost all in excellent taste, but no es
pecial novelties were noted. However, it
is well to know that tne bodices fitted
closely and were elaborately trimmed,
most of them with mohair braid, as the
silk wears shabby so very rapidly. Tne
skirts were not as full as they have been,
and were gored, but flat on the nips. One
beautiful Duchesse (de Brissac) was in
mouse-gray cloth, the skirt wus absolutely
plain; the bodice had short basques and
rtsvers opening over a waistcoat of exqui
site antique velvet, with a high collar of
chinchilla. This most becoming fur was
not in vogue last winter, but this season
it is restored to popular favor in Paris and
the East, and as a result is in great de-
mand. Worn with this toilette was a
high-crowned black velvet hat with white
feathers and loops of black velvet. Corn
tease de b'els was most picturesquely at
tired in grenat cloth, braided with black
round the hem and up the seams.
Her hat was adorned with folds of red
velvet and ropes of black beads. Princess
Murat had on a green cloth skirt stitched
round tbe bottom (exactly a dozen rows),
mounted with three small flat pleats at
the back, black satin blouse bodice with
pleats, flat slee"ves havine but slight full
ness at the shoulders only, held with twists
of black passementerie; hat with a crown
composed entirely of black cut jet beads,
and a brim of empire-green satin laid in
folds. A black aigrette completed it.
Extremely handsome also was a cos
tume of dark-blue vigogne, with blouse of
blue satin confined with a richly beaded
black belt and embroidered in gold and
cut jet. It fastened with a most gorgeous
and unique clasp. The short cape of old
Venetian point over bleck satin was
charming, and will be copied widely, as
over a bright- hued silk or satin it would
be just the thing for evening wear.
The high crowned gray felt hat which
went with it trimmed with a violet
aigrette and velvet of tbe same color was
the creation of an artist. Simple and
handsome was another gown worn on tbe
same occasion, it bping of a fine black
cloth finely braided, the jacket of an iron
gray cloth was embroidered in black. It
was stvlisb, as was the hat of black felt
trimmed with a black aigrette and some
beaded velvet.
Apropos of capes and jackets, smart
women are wearing capes only when out
driving and in the evening, never when
walking; they are useful and indispensable
articles, but should not be abused.
In Paris the elegantes now wash their
hair with paraffin, instead of water or
shampoo, and a well-known London hair
dresser is introducing the same method
there. Paraffin is a wonderful cleanser.
But the greatest precaution, owing to the
inflammable nature of paraffin, must be
taken in its use.
Cape of Clothing
Is a subject Dut little comprehended by
some women; as a result many with mod
erate incomes look decidedly shabby when
there is no real reason for it, simply, for
instance, because after paying a round of
calls or after a wearisome day's shopping
they return home exhausted, neglect to
brush their clothes and do not give a
glance to see whether there is a stitch
needed anywhere, so naturally the dust i<ets
ground into the garment and very Jikely
the next time the gown is donned it is in
haste and a pin takes the place of the
missing hook or eye, or the silken ruffle,
perhaps, has a slight tear which a pin has
to hold together. Of course, tne pin in
jures the goods and the ruffle will proba
bly tear badly, and such is the Deginning
of the end. Mothers should teach their
daughters, from the time they are chil
dren, to hang up their gowns and wraps
as soon as they take them off, after care
fully dusting and mending them as neatly
as possible; and every one snould remem
ber that all dinner, ball and handsome
gowns must be kept from the air and the
slightest exposure to dampness or dust.
Any observing person can detect at a
glance the sort of care clothes receive
There is no way to elude the mark of per
sonal carelessness, it speaks loudly from
every point and tells the story plainly to
the world. That is the evidence by which
we detect the frumpiness aud untidiness
of some of our friends in contrast to
others who are always spic and span, as if
they had come out of that proverbial
bandbox so often quoted. Many women
excuse themselves (when fortune no
longer smiles upon them) from keeping
up a well-groomed appearance by laying
the blame on the want of a maid or their
own helplessness to do for themselves.
Such a plea instead of being an excuse is
in reality accumulative evidence of innate
laziness and untidiness. Every woman
who cannot afford a maid is able to supply
the want by her own hands and go
through certain duties to her person and
clothes every day of her life unless she is
a confirmed invalid, utterly helpless.
Jl .Novel Collapette.
Quite a beautiful collarette has arrived
in town. It reaches to about six inches
below the shoulders, is of ermine cut in
square ends all around 4 thus, two squares
down the back, one large one extends
over each shoulder ana there are three in
front; a high collar of the same fur is also
cut into squares, and between each is in
troduced an accordion pleated ruche of
black mousseline de soie. It is lined with
white satin. Another differs from it
slightly, as the high collar is of black vel
vet with a lining of ermine.
Jl Dainty Tea Sown.
Quite beautiful are the tea-gowns I have
had illustrated for you, but one lately sent
home has a back cut in the Watteau style
of a lovely flowered silk. Over a cream
white ground are scattered great pink
rose?. Long ends of the silk float down
the front, and the big Medici collar of lace,
skillfully wired, is apparently held in
place in the back by boullonnes and bows
of pink satin ribbon. The skirt is of the
most exquisite quality of closely corded
creamy silk, but it is completely veiled by
the fine Frencn lace which falls from the
throat to the feet. The belt and yoke are
of rarely tine imitation gems.
"Jl Smart Frock."
Fancy a smart little gown cf an excel
lent shade of brown Amazon cloth. The
vest is of a most becoming shade of green
cloth. It is made with an absolutely
plain skirt and an artistic Jittle tabbed
Zouave, with two shoulder capes; the
softly folded waistband, the novelty col
lar and yoke effect, the Zouave, capes and
sleeves are all braided by hand, with wide
black military braid.
For a schoolgirl very smart is a gray
tweed frock with tabs and buttons and a
braided front in black. The sleeves are
also braided. The crush collar is of crim
son taffeta and round the skirt inside is a
frill of the same silk.
Two Cozy Dressing Sowng
Belong to as many brides. One of these
is of a new material known as "swans
down molleton." It is covered with a
large check in light blue, the ground
being of a biscuit color. The great turned
down coKar of white silk is beautifully
embroidered in blue silk and edged with
cream guipure lace. Wide blue silk rib
bons tie it in front. The other is of a
cream flannel adorned with quite elabor
ate insertions of edging of butter-colored
iace. Numberless tucks are on the bodice,
nnd round the skirt is a broad-gathered
flounce.
Private Theatricals.
Scarcely ever have San Francisco society
matrons or maids undertaken to give a
play, no matter how simple, that has not
been brilliantly successful, and it is to be
hoped that during this winter amateur
theatricals may receive due attention. A
Paris correspondent writes that the pri
vate and amateur theatricals at the
Chateau de Josselin were very successiul,
and as the costumes worn by the Duchesse
de Rohan and her daughters are described,
I quote the descriptions, as the play is a
pretty one, which could easily be given in
any large house. The play chosen wa
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1896.
"Les Danicheffs": "The part of Comtesse
Danicheff was played in plain violet vel
vet, the low bod.cc surrounded with
Alencon lace and a necklace of three rows
of enormous pearls. In the part of Prin
cess Lydia Velanoffs, a vert d'eau satin
skirt quite plain was worn, with pretty
low bodice of pink crepe plisse, in the
hair aigrette of feathers and diamonds.
A traveling dress was of mouse gray
cloth with silver embroidery, bodice with
short basques and revers embroidered
with silver, and a full guimpe of spangled
gray crepe; large Vandyke hat of drawn
black tnlle and immense black plumes.
The Dart of Anna was played first in a
Russian costume, and at the end of the
play tbe dress was pink taffetas with full
plisse sleeves, blouse bodice draped, and
rnches of pink tulle round the neck and
en jabot."
"As to the skirts of dresses, they are
made clearing the ground, sometimes with
a stiffening of horsehair or tuch like tissue
in the hem, sometimes without it. They
are gored rather in the umbrella style,
but not much gored at the back, leaving
fullness enough to make three flat double
pleats at the back. The skirts of thick
material are generally made plain. If
trimming is used it must be flat salons or
passementeries, flnuncings or fullings not
being suitable for heavy stuffs."
I wish women would realize the fact
that a hkirt pattern winch suits perfectly
a short, stout woman will not be suitable
for her tall, slender sister; also that the
pattern for a walking-skirt cannot be
transformed into an evening one by tack
ing on a train. The result is sure to be
extremely absurd. If you only take care
to investigate you will tind that for every
imaginable occasion and for all styles of
women Â«.pecial skirt patterns are to be
had, and ihese emanate from the great
Parisian designers.
"Jl Pretty .Model."
I am sure you will all appreciate a dress
made of one ol the pretty ribbed cloths in
pigeon gray, and such a grny as may be
worn in the street in midwinter. The
skirt is perfectly plain and wonderfully
well bung. The bodice is roundâ fitted
with a very deep black velvet yoKe, quite
squnreâ braided with a flat purple ribbon
braid in scrolls. Side pieces of black vel
vet similarly braided seem to be a part of
the yoke, entering the sleeve seams as
well as the seams of the bodice under the
arm. Th<>y curve prettily in front, jacket
style, and end at the hips in a round
curve.
The cloth back is tucked and drawn into
a black velvet belt, which slips under these
side pieces and fastens with a buckle of
brilliants aud gold work. In front, while
the cloth is drawn down into a slight
point, the sides only are laid in tucks, a
cluster of five each, which come from
under the velvet side pieces, leaving the
cloth plain in the center. To harmonize
with this costume nothing more charming
than a purple ye vet toque could be worn,
with its drapery combined with yellow
lace and clusters of violets peeping out
here and there, and aigrette twists of vel
vet at the side.
Suggestions fop the .Men.
A man from Brooklyn writes, asking a
New York journal if a frock coat is proper
for au informal occasion, such as a call,
when evening dress is not worn. Now
much the same question has just been
asked me. I can easily cover every point
by giving the journal's reply, as on all
such matters it is undoubted authority.
"Consideration as to appropriateness of
dress only becomes of importance when
formality is the leading idea. Any
kind of dress is appropriate for in
formal occasions, for informality means
there being no strict rules what
ever. The guide for informal occasions
is that one should learn how others are to
dress and to dress about as they do. As a
matter of formality, a frock coat is strictly
an afternoon coat and should not be worn
in the evening. In New Y.>rk gentlemen
do not make calls in the evening in frock
coats unless they happen to be on terms
of great familiarity with the people on
whom they call, wearing anything but
evening dress being in the nature of a
liberty taken. And in New York society
formal calls are not made in the evening,
but in the afternoon any day of the week."
All ties are wider and broader for even
ing and semi-evening wear, and are tied
in a manner that suggests something of
the French style, but are not so pro
nounced. Men nowadays take a certain
pride in imparting to their ties an air of
individuality.
Fancy waistcoats with huge plaid
checks and bars on a drab background
were imjxtrted, presumably for our young
"country squires." but are quite dreadful.
As a result the "country squires" have
not.taken kindly to them, neitner does
the correctly turned out New Yorker pay
any attention to the wild rumors concern
ing embroidered waistcoats for evening
wear, and any display of jewelry is con-
sidered an indication of hopelessly bad
taste to say the very least.
Brown and gray tweeds are the most
fashionable colors for this winter. The
morning or business suit which is the
most popular is the sack coat having three
buttons, the waistcoat and trousers being
of the same fabric. As yet the morning
coat, so much litced in England, has not
been adopted in this country. It is made
of cheviot or vicuna, with long tails, but
at the bottom the rkirt is narrow. Ii cor
responds to our old cutaway. Across the
pond it is worn as a suit neclige. C. C.
So numerous are the questions asked
as to what a groom shouid wear when a
bride wears a tailor gown that I consider
it best to give you Vogue's very excellent
reply to such a question:
At a 6 o'clock church wedding, when
the bride is in traveling dress, the bride
groom, best man and ushers wear frock
coats, with waisi coats to match, of black
vicuua, gray trousers, white shirt and
cellar, white four-in-hand or Ascot, top
hat and patent leather shoes. The guests
should appear at the church in afternoon
dress. A reception afterward would not,
unless it began after 7 o'clock, necessitate
evening dress.
Purists in dress insist that a man should
always be in the same style of dress as the
woman accompanying him. For example,
if the woman has a tailor-made gown, he
should be in tweeds or afternoon dress.
If she is in evening dress he should be also
And that applies to a theater or a public
restaurant in tbe evening. If a woman
has a tailor-made gown and is dining in it
in the evening the man should not be in
evening dress but should be in afternoon
dress.
At a wedding where the bride is in a
traveling dress, as is sometimes the case
when she ieaves tne church to proceed
directly to a train without an intervening
reception, the groom would wear a dark
traveling suit of tweed. If she has a re
ception gown (in other words an after
noon dress) he would wear a frock coat; or
if she has a bridal gown high in the neck,
as all bridal gowns are in this country, he
would wear a frock coat. If the wedding
is in the evening he would wear an even
ing suit. This is the exact idea. Present
custom, however, has the bridegroom
almost invariably in a frock coat for any
morning or afternoon church wedding.

Protection From Lightrving.
It has long been held from practical ex-
perience that the network of wires now
found in many towns protects those
places from the effects of lightning, and
probably also prevents many thunder
storms from breaking over them. An
official inquiry has been recently made in
Germany as to the influence exerted by
telephone wires on atmospheric eiec
tricity, with a view to set at rest the ques
tion whether danger from lightning
stroke is increased or diminished by a
close network of wires. This has shown
that ihe wires tend to weaken the violence
and diminish the danger of the lightning
stroke. Returns obtained from 340 towns
provided and from 560 not provided with
a telephone system show that tbe danger
varies, on the average, in the proportion
of 1 to 4.6 between the two cases.
J-|ir\ts for Stamp Collectors.
The following are some of the varieties
of tricks practiced by unscrupulous per
sons, says Harper's Round Table:
1. Ordinary perforated stamps with ex
ceptionally wide margins have their per-
forations trimmed off, and such stamps
are offered as rare unperforated stamps.
2. Ordinary perforated stamps with wide
margins are reperforated with the rare
perforations. This is frequently done by
means of an ordinary hand punch.
3. Where stamps are printed in the same
color, with slight changes in lettering, the
rare varieties are made by piecing. For
instance, the 1 franc French Empire is
made by takfcg the 80 centimes, dark car
cime, with the bottom label from the 1
franc of the republic.
4. Bicolored stamps with the center re
versed, which are extremely rare, are
made by catting out the center ana revers
ing it on another copy of the same stamp.
For instance, the 1869 United States Iff.
cent, 24-cent and 90-cent have been made
by this process.
5. By chemical means the color is
changed. For instance, the lOr blue of
Brazil is changed into the lOr black.
6. Stamps which have been canceled
by pen and ink have their cancellation
marks removed by chemical means, and
these stamps are then sold as unused.
7. Counterfeit cancellations are fre
quently made on genuine stamps which
have been surcharged "reprint" or "speci
men."
8. Counterfeit surcharges are extremely
common. They can be made on an ordi
nary printing press.
9. False water -marks are sometimes
made by printing the stamps with wood
cuts, using a certain kind of oil, or they are
made by pressing the design of the water
marks on the stamp and then removing a
portion of the paper by rubbing with
pumice-stone.
10. Very rare stamps of which a portion
has disappeared have had these portions
added.
JaUing Cold.
Any one who is not in robust health
easily falls a prey to illness, says Dr.
Pheltshoe. Of all causes of "cold," prob
ably fatigue is one of the most common.
A jaded man coming home at night from
a iong day's work, a growing youth losing
two hours' sleep over evening parties two
or three times a week, a young lady heav
ily "doing the season," or young children
overfed and with short allowance of sleep,
are common instances of the victim of
cold. Luxury is favorable to chill-taking.
Very hot rooms, feather beds and soft
chairs create a sensitiveness that leads to
catarrh. Probably many chills are con
tracted at night or at the fag end of the
day, when tired people tret the equilibrium
of their circulation disturbed by either
overheated sitting-rooms or underheated
bedrooms and bed*. This is especially
the case with elderly people. In such
cases the mischief is not always done in
stantaneously, or in a single night. It
often takes place insidiously, extending
over days, or even weeks.
Apples for the Gomplexiorv.
"The secret of a bad complexion," said
Dr. Collison, "is a bad digestion, and we
generally trace that to a bad liver. One of
the best remedies for a sluggish liver is
cheap and pleasant. Dieting is the secret
of the cure. The best liver regulator for
persons of sedentary habits â and those are
the ones whose complexions are muddy â
is to be found in apples, eaten baked if
they are not well digested when eaten
raw. I attended the pupils to a weil
known boarding, school, and among them
was a country girl whose complexion was
the envy of all her associates. I found
that she was a very light eater at her
meals, but she had a peculiar custom of
taking a plate of apples to her room at
night and eating them slowly as she
studied her lessons. This was her regular
practice. Some of the other girls in the
institution took it up, and I know, as a
result of my personal investigation, that
the apple-eating girl has the best com
plexion of any in the school."
jKe Arizona |<lummvj.
An Arizona hunter named Jonn Mc-
Carty has brougnt into Prescott a mummy
that is believed to antedate the Indians
ana is of a decidedly different type. He
found it while hunting a lion, which he
had treed and brought down in the Verde
Canyon. In a cliff dwelling he had founa
a sealed chamber, 7x9 feet. Tearing it
open he met a ghastly sight. It was his
mummy skeleton on a soapweed mat,
with the body upright and head erect, the
long aims haneine straight down from
the shoulders. In life he wrfs about 5 feet
7 inches high. In one hand was grasped a
stone ax, in the other a bundie ol barbed,
flinv-headed arrows. As the air rushed
into the vmolt the rawhead shafts of the
arrowheads and tie rawhide handle of the
ax crumbled to asftes, as did the mat and
the mantle which covered the mummy.
The fine, brown hair, about two feet in
length, fell from the bead. In the cave
were found several earthenware bowls, a
tortoise shell and about $1800 worth of best
grade turquoise in the rough, just as it
was taken from the Jedge. The pieces
ranged in size from tbe dimensions of a
walnut to thosÃ of a hen's egg.

HoW to Make an Aeoliarv |larp.
Of very thin cedar, pine or other soft
wood make a box five or six inches deep,
seven or eight inches wide and of a length
just equal to the width of the window in
which it is to be placed. Across the top,
near each end, glue a strip of wood half
an inch high and a quarter of an inch,
thick for bridges. Into the ends of the
box insert wooden pins like those of a
violin to wind the strings aroundâ two
pins in each end. Make a round hole in
the middle of the top and string the box
with small catgut or blue tirst fiddle
strings. Fastening one end of each string
to a metallic pin in one end of the box
and carrying it over the bridges wind it
round the turning pin in the opposite end
of the box. The ends of the box should
be increased in thickness where the
wooden pins enter by a piece of arood
glued upon the inside. Tune the strings
in unison and place the box in the win*
dow. It is better to have four strings, as
described; but a harp with a single string
produces exceedingly sweet notes, which,
vary with the force of the wind.
Evil Jtabits of a Jhrush.
Recently a solicitor applied at Maryle
bone Police Court on behalf of a landlord
who desired that his tenant should be
compelled to cease keeping a thrush
which began to s< reech like a steam en
gine at 3 o'clock every morning. The
owner would not destroy the bird, so tho
neighbors threw stones at it, without,
however, causing it to cease a noise that
was (as alleged) intolerable and injurious
to health. Mr. Plowden said a person
w.as within his right in keeping a singing
bird, and the applicant's comparison of it
to a steam whistle must be taken with a
large grain ot salt. The remedy was to
give the tenant notice to quit. â VVestmin

wouldn't have been laid up with a surained
ankle. Hello! look out of the window,
quick, Julian! Isn't that Uncle Peter
Brindlow earning up the street? Oh, he's
cominc this way ! Hurrah!"
Mr. B indlow brought in a whirl of the
keen, frosty air Julian pined for.
"I've come la to see the invalid," he
said in his- pleasant, hearty way, "and
congratulate him on the bruises and black
eyes he has missed these two days. Weil.
Julian, how are you?"
"Says he's sick of it," Ned explained,
making his cartwheel movement across
the floor, which was his fuvorite way of
expressing extreme satisfaction.
"Pretty bard lines," .Uncle Peter ad
mitted, seating himself before the lire.
"Makes me think oi the time when I was
laid up in a cowboy's cabin on the Ne
braska plains, and every day seemed as
long as a week."
''Yes, that's just it!" Julian echo d.
"It seems a whole month since I've had
my skates on. I w ; sh you'd tell us a
good, rousing story, Uncle Peter; not
anything you've read â something that
really happened."
"Long ago, when you were a boy," Ned
suggested.
"Oh. that is not so very long ago," Mr.
Brindlow answered, drily â "twice as long
as yours and Julian's ages, minus Jim's."
White Ned made rapid calculations on
his ringers. Jim and Cicely came in from
their walk in the park, and Mary followed
with the lamps, for it was almost aark;
but Uncle Peter said that the firelight was
much more appropriate for story-telling â
to which they all agreed.
Mr. Brindlow was uncle by courtesy
only; but, as Ned often observed, "he
could not be- nicer if he was a true rela
tion."
"When I was a small boy, something
over thirty years ago," he began, when
his little audience was circled cozily
around the fire, "my father move I to
Colorado and took up a squatter's claim
in a very lonely part of the Territory,
fifty miles west of where Denver was
afterward built.
"Soon after we moved there a town
sprang up a dozen miles away, on a
branch of the P:atte River. There was
talk of a school and many modern im
provements, which were never realized,
for the whole scheme went up like a sud
den flame and died out completely, leav
ing us as far away from civilization as
ever.
"There were three of usâ Harry, next to
me, and Dot. a little, ros-y, chubby girl
of 3 â all about as happy as any children
could be. Mother worried because there
were no schools or other advantages for
us, and, as time went by, urged father to
make a borne elsewhere for our sakes; but
we were compelled to live on the claim
for five years or lose the land rieht.
"It happened, three years after we set
tled there, that an Eastern mining com
pany sold off a lot of land, eight or ten
miles away, including a wotked-out mine,
which went at auction price, and father
bought a small portion of it for a few dol
larsâseven, I th:nk. "But the men said
it was not worth that. It was only a little
circle of mounds at the loot of Sandy
Mountain.
"When other purchasers reopened the
mines as an experiment they discovered
what appeared to be a vein of valuable
gold ore on my father's property. He im
mediately put all his savings into mining
apparatus and began work
"As it vras necessary for him to be away
irom home the greater part of the time,
be looked about for a man to keep an eye
on his home prope r ty while he wa3 away,
and sleep in the cabin, though mother
protested against the idea, saying that she
was not afraid with two *uch big boys to
protect her. At all events, the right man
could not be found and father was forced
to leave us.
"One afternoon, two weeks later, when
we were at work over our winter woodpile,
a young fellow came down the trail from
the upper settlement and, on observing
us, stopped at the gate to ask his way to
Monica mines. We told him it was ten
miles by the gulch road, straight ahead.
He shaded his eyes from the direct rays
of the sun, calculating how long its wan
ing light would last.
"We saw at a glance that he was of In
dian bloodâ probably a half-breed Man
dan, as that tribe was most numerous
then. He was tall and straight as an ar
row, with finely poised head, thin, aqui
line features, swarthy skin and the pierc
ing black eyes of his race, rie would have
been handsome but for the unlovely
marks of hardship and deprivation.
'"You can't walk all that way to
night?' Harry said, interrogatively.
' 'Yes, I must,' be replied, in good Eng
lish.
"But Harry ran in to ask mother's opin
ion; and when she returned wiih iiim and
saw how tired and travel-worn the poor

fellow was, she asked him in to rest and
share our evening meal.
"tie told us that he was called Joe by
his English-speaking friends, but his In
dian name was Little- White-Hawt. He
had no home, and was going to Monica
mines in hopes of finding work.
"We knew he would be disappointed in
this, for father had told us he had more
workmen ihan he could employ steadily,
and every day brought mo:'- laborers from
the surrounding country, all of which
mother told him.
"When supper was over it was quite
dark, anil mother asked Joe to stay over
night with us, for in those days the
coyotes were pretty thick out there, arui
occasionally a mountain lion strayed down
in search of prey, making a lonely night
trp rather dangerous.
"Well, to shorten my story, mother was
so well impressed with Joe's quiet be
havior and frank, honest face, that she of
fered him a home for the winter in return
for his services about the house, which he
thankfully accepted.
"He turned out to be a good, obliging
fellow, respectful, intelligent and kind,
especially to Dot, of whom he grew very
fond. Father was also much pleased with
him, and after his advent came home less
often, for he was extremely busy at the
mines. He was prospering beyond his ex
pectations.
"He brought home several times boxes
of gold dust for safekeep'tig until be could
dspose of it at Santa Fe, for, in spite of all
his precautions at the mines, some had
been ' stolen. As no one knew he took it
home it was perfectly safe placed in our
cellar in an iron box behind the potato
barrel.
"Autumn lengthened into early winter
of unusual severity, snow fell steadily day
after day until the roads were impassable,
except for stout-hearted woodsmen, who
plunged waist-deep through the feathery
mass, for it was at first too soft for snow
shoes.
"Joe plodded cheerfully through the
drifts when occasion required a trip to the
nearest settlement for food or some neces
sity. Nothing was too hard or too tire
some for him. He had the true Indian
spirit â the dogged perseverance that never
flinchesâ having once undertaken a task
he never relinquished it until he had con
quered it.
"His unfailing cheerfulness shamed us
when we felt inclined to grumble over
trifl<>B. At night, when we sat before ihe
blazing hearth in our little snow-bound
cabin, and mother read to us or taught us
simple lessons from old sciioolbooks. Jot
was always most attentive and eager to
learn.
"One afternoon Mr. Avery, a man from
the upper settlement, came out to see
mother on what he called very particular
business.
"â¢Sorry to trouble you,' he be^an, lift
ing hia hat as he came in, but reiusing to
be seated. 'I want to see that Indian
servant of yours.'
" 'Joe,' mother corrected, quietly. 'He
is not at home.'
' Hem! It's rather important that I
should see him,' he said. 'Fact is, I've
got a warrant for his arrest. Perhaps you
remember sending him tome last week
With a message from Mr. Brindlow. Well,
while he waited in my house he stole a
$10 bill which my wife had carelessly left
on her dresser. 1 found that bill at Wil-.
son's store, passed by tne Indian, "Wilson
said. I Knew the bill 'he minute I set my
eye on it, for it was a perfectly new treas
ury no c. I'd marked it in one corner by
a scratch of my thumbnail. Quite unmis
takable evidence, you see.'
"Of course we did not believe Joe guilty.
Mother entreated Mr. Avery to withdraw
the charge, but this he refused to do, say
ing it was not his first offense.
" 'He has been with us four months.'
mother srid, in Joe's defense, 'and in all
that time has given me no cause to com
plain. I think you are mistaken in spite
of your circumstantial evidence.'
" 'But I have abundant proofs that he is
an old offender, 1 Mr. Avery insisted.
"He's old ("hippewah's sen, to begin with.
After his father's capture he was sent to
Montana to a Mandan school, where he
was clothed and fed, but was finally ex
pelled on account of general vagrancy.'
''That was ba I, but it did not convince
mother of Joe's worthlessness. She begged
bis accuser to give him another trial,
offering also to refund the money he was
accused of stealing. Mr. Avery protested
at first, saying it was not so much the
.offense itself as the principle that prompted
it that he looked at, bu: after polite hesi
tation he took the money and went his
way.
"Joe returned from the mines that
niuht, tired and hunery. Mother gave
him his s-upper in the kitchen, while we
hovered over the sitting-room fire, full of
evil apprehensions.
"After a long time the door opened and
Joe appeared, locking very pale even in
the rosy glow of the firelight. We ex
pected lervent protestations of innocence,
and his unnatural quiet frightened us
more than a confession of guilt would
have done.
"'I will go away,' he said, gravely,
looking straight into our eager, troubled
faces.
" 'Not to-night,' Harry entreated. 'We
know it is not true.'
" 'Part of it is,' Joe admitted, with a
great effort to control his emotion. "I am
Chippewah's son, and I did run away
from the school, but I have never stolen
anything in my life â oh, nev-r!'
"We urged him to stay at least over
night, but he would not be persuaded
against his own judgment. He murmured

dry sob ruahed out into the gathering
gloom of the early winter's ni ht, Dot's
s; rrowful little wail following him from
the open door.
"As the days wore on to weeks, we
missed him sorely; our evening circle was
incomplete without his slender figure in
the chimney corner; the stories were
duller without his swi;t, brilliant smiie
and mellow laughter and his eager inter
est to stimulate u<.
"When Mr. Avery heard that Joe had
left us he very unjustly circulate 1 the
story of his supposed theft, and added a
long line of misdemeanors gathered from
uncertain sources.
"I regret to say that we boys, who knew
Joe so well and should bave upheld his
Honor, began to believe evil things of him,
as ho did not return to contradict the
rumors; but when father came home,

working at the mines and was very much

I suppose you have all heard the wise
saying, "Do not try to kill two birds with
one stone." A little boy named Donald,
whom most of you feel quite well ac
quainted with, had his af.ention called to
it in some way a short time ago and wns
quite anxious to understand its exact
meaning. His auntie very carefully ex
piained v to him, and the cute little fel
low, feeling very important, stored it
away in his memory-box for future use.
But alas ! alas ! the mischievous Brownie
who has charge of that box plays sad
pranks with its contents sometimes and
mixes things up pretty badly, as he did
in Donald's case.
A few evenings after the above con
versation, when it was time for wee boys
to go to Slumberland, .Donald's mamma
said to him, "Begin to undress now, dear,
and when mamma has your soft little
nest all ready she'll do the finishing-up
part."
"All right," answered the lad, as he
took his favorite picture-book, opened it
and placed it on his mamma's bed. Then
ne began slowly to unbutton his coat,
standing in front of the book, and looking
at the pictures the while. Mamma left
the room en some errand without glanc
ing in Donald's direction. On her return
she found him gazing with delight at a
picture of a monkey pulling a dog's tail,
and still slowly working away at the first
button !
"Oh, dearl" she cried, "when shall I
ever succeed in teaching my boy to do one
thing at a time!"
"But, mamma, '' quickly answered Don
ald, a.s he went to work with a will, "don't
you see, I was killing one bird with two
stones 1" M. W. R.

Oh, Jim and Belle are very dear friends!
One never without the other.
Jimmie loves Belle best on earth,
Next to his own dear mother.
When Jiramie runs away to school
Belle is always sure to follow.
And then the teacher tires her out,
Because she's such a poor, uoor fccholar.
Jimmie goes to church on Sunday,
And Belle waits upon the stair, â¢
Whether she's cola, or tired of waiting,
Nobody ever seems to care.
Jimmie sometimes goes a-calling,
Of course poor Belle stays outside.
If he jumps upon a streetcar,
She runs along, but has never a ride.
Jim and the boys went camping,
And gladly took Miss Bel.c along,
When all around the fire were singing,
She didn't know even a line of a song.
And, then, when the boys were drilling.
She sat quite stili and watched herchum.
Shecouldu't march a step with them,
Nor even beat a drum.
Sunday morn the girls came round
To visit the boys in csmp.
None came for Jim, so off with Belle,
He wont over the hilU to tramp,
Now this is why Jim loved her so,
And by his side lets her jog.
Belle is not a girl, you know.
But only a Dig Muck dog.

Her Last Season's W^eel
Ske Jakes It /\part, Paints and Polishes It
and Then Makes It SerVe for
Decorative Purposes
Here is an important bit of news that
will be of intense interest to every bicycle
rider.
The brainy bicycle girl has discovered
what to do with her last season's wheel.
Her clever discovery solves a provoking
problem, as it transforms the ugly, rusted
and decrepit bike into a beautiful artistic
triumph. In every city this, the latest
idea, is developing into a full-fledÂ«*ed fad. j
So new, however, is this latest proof of the ;
bicycle girl's genius for doing bright
things that only those who are decidedly
abreast of the times have heard of it, and
to few has the pleasure been granted of
beholding the charming result of her
handiwork.
This winter will see a change in the
â¢ home of the bicycle girl. From cellar to
â¢ roof her home will look "bicycley," to
coin a word. Golden mural wheels will
. greet the eye in the drawing-room, sil
vered chains that once croaned with dust
and crease will be draped on the mantel
â¢piece, and every part of a bite's anatomy,
ber:bboned and ornamented, will serve a
â¢decorative and useful purpose.
Hereafter when curious versons wonder
m ba: has become of the old wheel all they
have to do to find out is to visit the
m home of some bicycle youns woman and
look at the walls of the living-rooms.
. Here is an artistic explanation of the j
secret â one of the sort that he who runs
.may see if he cannot read. This very de
' lightful state of affairs is all brought j
about through a little artistic ability and j
gold-colored "painu
The picture that accompanies this arti- !
cle shows what happens after brisk polish- !
ing and a little golden paint hay been â 
combined. The girl who is driving the j
nail in the wall will fasten that wheel that j
' she has in tbe same place. She has made {
jt he wheel look as if it had bathed in a ray |
of sunlight and the sunlight had forgotten
Â«â¢ go away. The rest of the bicycle that
lies on the floor is sure to become bits of
decorative art before lons.
. It has required a deal of clever thought
on the part of the girls who ride wheels to
conceive decorative uses for all the curi
ously shaped parts that go lo make up the
bicycle as a whole. There is a frame, for ,
instance. It is ugly in itseli, but when i
gilded and decorated with ribbons of a j
color that will make it harmonize with
the wallpaper it forms no mean addition
to the general ensemble of tbe room.
The front forks of a wheel apparently
' contain no elements of beauty, and yet
when benbboned and decorated with little |
.brass hooks form a very convenient arti- j
cle from which to hang button-hooks, {
glove-buttoners, etc. The handle-bars I
znay be utilized for hat-racks, or if tbe
young woman wishes to manufacture a
chair with a back line nothing else it
DEVICE FOR CLEANING SHIPS' BOTTOMS.
would be a matter of small difficulty to do ;
bo. Inasmuch as gilded chairs are all tbe
â¢ ashion nowadays this latter idea will un
questionably prove very popular.
It always tatces the brain of the woman
who loves to fill her home with ornaments
lo conceive a sort that no one else has, or
at least that few possess. Possibly this is
why the bicycle girl so promptly decided
to paint the pedals with the golden mix
ture, fasten lone ribbons to them and then j
hang them from t&e lambrequins. The j
effect is charming, and the tasteful use of â 
ribbon is the only absolute requirement I
to bring about the desired result.
Think of the round and slabbed crank of
spring steel being usel a3 a parlor orna
ment! Yet it is, and it makes a very pretty )
one, too, only It has to be used in con
junction with others just like it. When
gilded and tacked upon a wall in tbe form
of a letter "S," this company of cranks
" presents a very attractive appearance.
Then there is the chain. Tnis i 3i 3 one of
those parts of the bicycle which can be
put to a dozen different uses in decorative I
form. For instance, carved and fastened j
in the form of a hook, it will serve as an
l admirable article upon which the tennis
I bat may be hung, or the golf stick depend,
â¢and there are plenty of other ways to
make it both useful and ornamental. The
wheel itself, minus the tire, of course,
when gilded and smartly decorated with
ribbon, gives a very unique effect to the
â wall on which it is placed, and causes the
room to present anything but a stiff ap
pearance. Ii appears almost shot to the
.core with sunshine.
Tnere is, perhaps, no feature of the bi
cycle, when considered from a decorative
standpoint, that can be utilized in a more
attractive manner than the lamp. A col
lection of lamps by cyclists is something
of a fad by itself, but the decoration of the
wails of a room with them might at first
be considered an impossible task. It is,
however, not only not impossible, but de
lightful in effect. There are so many
kinds of iamps nowadays that they are
discarded much sooner than they used to
be, for the simple reason thai tbe cyclist
is inclined to become tired of one kind
and sigh ior another.
80 it is tbat the bicycle girl who deco
rates may have infinite variety of lamps.
One particularly fetching fashion that is
popular with her, in tbe matter of lamps,
is to arrange them in rough imitation of a I
swan. Inside each lamp a wax candle is j
placed. In the evening these candles are
lighted, and the effect to the eye is charm
ing indeed. Of course every lamp is gilded.
The glass in the lamps varies in color,
sometimes red, occasionally green, and
/once in a while white. Of course this fact
g>ust be kept in view by the young woman
wiien arranging the decoration. The varie
gated colors which shine out when tbe
lamps are lit eive a most curious effect,
and almost puzzle the eye, so unique is
the combination. It looks for all the
woild lust as the colored signal lights of
a steamer, arranged one above the other,
woÂ«iJ appear.
There have been all sorts of fads con- ,
ceived for which the bicycle is responsi
ble, but none that have been really more
charming than this or more popular than
this bids fair to De. The possibility of this
idea being adopted by persons with both
long and short purses results from the
fact that there is absolutely no market
for old bicycles at present. Not so very

about what she likes.
To effect this transformation the up-to
daie bicycle girl gets up a "bicycle

friends and tells them to come prepared
to work. Old gloves are drawn on and
aprons hunted up and thus attired the
girls look full of business. Then the con- |

brushesâ one for the finer work in hand
and the other to lay the gold paint

wrench and attacks the nuts. The
others bring a stepladder and a
basnet of pretty hued ribbons. Then the
work of demolition of the old and the re
construction of the golden mural wheel
begins. All the girls take part in plan
ning the decoration. What does not sug
gest itself to one does to another, and the
symposium of ideas is responsible fcr a
much prettier effect than a single bicycle
girl could work out. The seat is carefully
cilded and encircled with a wide blue rib
bon. It is then hung in a corner of the
room. It presents an odd but pleasing
appearance, and catches the eye of the
visitor. This bizarre effect is sought after
and the bicycle parts readily lend them
selves to it.
The bicycle tires are bathed in gold and
inflated. Then an oval picture is robbed
of its old-fashioned walnut frame and set
in the golden circlet. Should the bicycle
girl's small brother investigate its infla
tion with a pin, the effect would collapse, '
but she wisely forestalls his arts by
hanging it high. The balls from the bear
ings are polished and placed in the pin
tray as souvenirs.

To Glean Ships' Bottoms.
Numerous indeed have been the inven
tions for cleaning the bottoms of ships
when they become foul with barnacles
and marine growth. This might seem an
easy task to those who have never seen
the bottom of a vessel that has just fin
ished a voyage around tbe Horn. It is
covered with a veritable garden of all
sorts of vegetable matter that hangs to
ward the bottom of the ocean at least six
feet. In this there is a colony of barna
cles and shell fish, al'. seeming contented
and happy. To readily remove this un
desirable accumulation is the aim of many
inventors; most of them have been fail
ures and at pr sent the best accepted way
to clean a shp is to put her in a drydock
and sctub her off.
Mark W. Mar6den of Philadelphia, Pa.,
however, has been granted a patent on an
invention to accomplish this work that
seems to possess some qualities that will
make it successful. Whether it will prove
so or not can only be found on a practical
trial.
Mr. Marsden's apparatus in really a sort
of drydock, although it does not neces
sarily have to raise the vessel out of tbe
water. An end view of it is very much
like the letter TJ, and tbe vessel to be
cleaned, in theory, passes through the up
rights. At the bottom and sides of tbe in
terior of the uprights is arranged a series
of brushes that are operated by engines in
the uprights.
The apparatus is of course hollow and
capable of being filled with water like the
ordinary drydock.
The vessel to be cleaned is made faÃt at
the bow and the cleaning apparatus sunk
to the proper depth and run underneath
her. Water Is thÂ«n pumped out and she
is allowed to rise until in close contact
with the sidea and bottom of the vessel.
The brushes are started in motion and the
cleaning machine towed aft, removing in
its progress all of the accumulated growth
and leaving her as "clean as a whistle.^
HoW a Letter f/lay Be Recalled.
The public is not as familiar with its
privileges atout postal matters as might
be supposed. Many times people would
like to recall a letter after it has Deen
mailed. This can be done, even if the let
ter has reached the postoffice at its des
tination. At every postoffice there are
what are called "withdrawal blanks." On
application they will be furnished, and,
when a deposit is made to cover the ex
pense, the postmaster will telegraph to
the postmaster at the Jatter's destination
asking that it be promptly returned. The
applicant first signs this agreement: "It
is hereby aereert that, if the letter ia re
turned to me, I will protect you from any
and all claims made againsi you for
such return, and will indemnify you for
any iossvou may sustain by reason of such
action. And I herewith deposit $ to
cover all expenses incurred and will de
liver to you the envelope of the letter re
turned." In many cases persons have
made remittances to fraudulent parties or
irresponsible firms, not learning t 1 eirtrue
character until after the letter had gone
and have succeeded in recalling them.
There is an instance where a Kansas City
merchant had remitted a dishonest travel
ing man a draft for $170, mid by means of a
withdrawal rescued the draft just in time.

Curious Case of Skin-Grafting at San Rafael
Yards of Cuticle HaVe Beer\ Gut From Obliging Friends to
Obliterate a Little Qirl's Jerrible Bums
Over at San Rafael lives a bright little
girl who for a year past has been undergo
ing tho tortures of skin-graJting, and who
for another year must almost weekly
suffer through the same ordeal.
A year ago Jessie Proudfoot, the daugh
ter of a well-known lumber-dealer over
there, invited a number of her friends into
the yard of her father's residence to play.
A bonfire seemed the most enjoyable way
of passing the time, and a merry blaze
was soon burning and, in their frolics
about the lire, some one pushed Jessie
into the flames, and in an instant her
clothes were burning.
The screams of her companions brought
assistance and the clothes were torn from
her body, but not before her hip and right
side were so badly scorched that the skin
came away in prÂ» at patches.
For a time the pirl's life was despaired
of, but she mended slowly and was finally
out of danger, though the little body bore
fearful evidences of the fire.
It was found that one placa on her right
side, 16 inches long by 9 inches wide,
would not heal and her parents were ad
vised t! at she would never be well and
comfortable unless skin-grafting was re
sorted to.
There being no alternative it was de
cided to begin operations at once, and a
search was begun for friends who were
willing to part with a portion oi their
cuticle to help out the little sufferer.
As soon as it became known what was
wanted there were plenty of volunteers,

Race Tendency Is to Build
Dp Botl? Brain and Body
sar\ Francisco Doctors QiVe Their VieWs or\
the Comparative J^lental and Phys
: ical Development of Mankind
There seems to be no doubt at ali that
humanity is becoming more intellectual,
but the Sorosis Club of New York has re
cently been discussing the question as to
whether, while the race is developing
mentally, it is deteriorating physically.
Even to those persons who place the prr
cedence of mental endowments over physi
cal at the highest notch this is a serious
problem, for the body is the foundation
ana the superstructure will be sure to be
no stronger than the base. The carica
tures seen in the comic papers of the
Boston boy with evidently more head
than health, if they tell oi conditions
existing anywhere outside of imagination,
should make laughter lead to reformation.
It may reasonably be supposed that as
humanity advances in experience all tho
best will be culled from tbe teachings of
past civilizations, and that Spartan
strength and endurance and Greek grace
and beauty of body will be more and more
a part of the perfections of the coming
race. When our leading physiologists
teach us that advancement to be
permanent must be attained by the care
and training of toth mind and body in
harmony, we may set down the anticipa
tion of the men of the future centuries
having colossal heads and frail bodies as a
mere nightmare.
Speaking of this discussion Dr. W. S.
Thorne, ex-president of the State Medical
Association, mentioned the poet Pope and
the statesman and historian, Alexander
Stephens of Georgia, as examples of how
a great brain can be sustained by a very
feeble body. But the doctor points out
that these examples do not properly enter
into the argument; the question is of the
race and such individuals are not among
the links that knit the generations each to
each. They are very interesting studies of
somethine abnormal, but the variation
from the type is not perpetuated. Such
men have no children, or If they do the
second generation is veiy feeble of both
mind and body, and the race goes on un
changed by their advent into the world.
Dr. Thorne is decidedly of the opinion
that bodily strength is not being sacrificed
in the effort to build up the brains of
young Americans. In fact, he holds that
while there are exceptions, such as the
ones just cited, men considered as a race
cannot possibly have highly developed
minds without fine physiques. He says:
"The general result of physical tiaining
in our schools and colleges and gymnasia
THE LATEST IN HORSESHOEING.
is eminently in the direction of race im
provement.
"It enables the naturally weak and feeble
to acquire* an academic training without
physical degeneracy, which under no other
conditions would be possible. It is a well
established belief among our best medical
thinkers that mental development and
physical training should go hand in hand,
and tbe experience of the last decade
amply justifies this belief."
In this connection the doctor calls atten
tion to the practice of Gladstone in main- ,
taining himself in splendid physical con
dition by means of regular exercise, and
says that without such a body his vast
and lonsr-suÃtained brain work could not
have been accomplished.
The directors of our educational insti
tutions are very careful to keep in check
the tendency of some students to go to ex
cass, either in the way of becoming book
worms or making athletics the all in all of
life.
That onr race is degenerating physically
be denies and states: "In a recent
visit to the Vatican museum in Rome I
carefully noted the size of many of
the ancient Roman and Greek busts found
there, and as the size of the head bears a
very close relation to the size of the body,
it is apparent that in physical develop
ment these classical races did not exceed,
or even equal, the average of the present
Anglo-Saxon."
Speaking of the advantages of the har
monious training of both mind and body,
Dr. Thorne quotes Dv Bois Raymond, the
greatest of living physiologists, as saying
"that exact, systematic and sustained
movements of the muscles actually in
crease the gray matter of the brain and
spinal column." That improvement of
the mind also has a powertul effect in
improving physical nealth is as well
known, and has recently been distinctly
observed in the noted improvement of the
general health of the children now being
trained in the Illinois asylum for the
feeble- minded.
These unfortunates, the doctor says,
can not only be improved, but they can be
so developed by physical and mental
training as to become responsible, and
self-sustaining citizens.
Dr. Winslow Andersen is anotber of our
prominent physicians who does not think
there is anything in the outlook to make
us fear that the body will not keep pace
with the mind in the evolution of the race.
He says, however, that up to a very recent
time in cur history, say twenty years ago,
there was great danger of the evil now be
ing discussed by Sorosis, Now the train
ers of youth all over the land understand
the peril of the neglect of systematic exer
cise in the schools and colleges, and by the
present methods the boys and girls will
Rrow up with healthy bodies and minds.
The doctor is a great believer in "mens
sana in corpore sano" and speaks of the
fine physiques of the English. He says
that even the ladies over there think noth
ing of a ten-mile walk before breakfast as
a constitutional. He says that while at
college he used to take a two hours' row
before breakfast and tbat it has a fine
effect in developing the chest.
It will be interesting to note that three
are two reasons given why the proposition
under discussion is con tract ictory. Dr.
Thorne says the race could not retrograde
physically while it went forward mentally,
because It takes a vigorous body to sustain
a good mental stature, and Dr. Anderson
thinks the proposition contains a contra
diction, because just in proportion as peo
ple become intellectual will they use their
intellects to improve their bodies.
Dr. Anderson says that Max Nordau,
in his fears about modern degeneracy, ia
mistaken and that his philosophy is false.
He thinks that man must have dyspepsia
or something seriously wrong with him,
because no man thoroughly sound would
look out upon the world through such
pessimistic spectacles.
Dr. W. F. McNutt says that he has not
examined recent statistics on the subject,
but he thinks it not improbable that the
general vitality of the race has been
lowered in modern times by the sfiillful
prolongation of the iives of consump
tives and other seriously unsound per
sons. This interference with nature's
sterner methods of promptly cutting
off the weak enables the weakened
individuals to perpetuate and multi
ply their lowered vitality and has
a large effect on the aggregate fig
ures, so that where the physician's
power pulls ihe race up in. one way it
pulls it down in another. There is no
doubt, he says, that the average duration
of life is in modern times much longer
than it was. He doubts if modern man
has as much endurance and power to
resist disease as formerly. If, however,
the consumptives and such ba elimin
inated from the calculation, and only
those of the race considered who furnish
a Hood foundation for progress to build
upon, he believes that we are improving
physically, mentally and morally.
So, if Sorosis will listen to the wisdom
of San Francisco she will decide her
problem with a hopeful, happy answer.
For Shoeing Horses.
Many years ago, when the inventive
abilities of the American people were just
awakening, an old blacksmith made the
statement: "Well, they can make sewing
machines, but they will never be able to
make a machine tbat will shoe a horse."
So far he has been correct, but John L.
Ream of Axtell, Kans., has just been
granted patents on a contrivance that
takes all the science out of the work and
makes it possible for almost anybody to
shoe a racer.
With Mr. Ream's machine it is no more
work to put a shoe on a horse's hoof than
it would De to put it on a fence post. This
is accomplished by making the horse as
much like a fence post as possible.
The aprjaratus consists of a couple of
upright beams and a series of blocks and
tackle intended to clasp the horse on all
sides. No matter how fractions a horse
may be he has to behave himself once he
is in the clutch of this apparatus. The
animal is driven between the uprights
and his halter fastened to a ring in the
ordinary way. Then by releasing certain
ropes a framework descends and catches
him so that he wSnders what is the mat
ter. Before he has found out he is all in
a knot. Ropes and tackle seize the leg to
be worked on and in an instant it is
straightened out in just the desired posi
tion. By turning a windlass it can bÂ«
raised or lowered to suit the blacksmith's
pleasure, and he can proceed with his
work while smoking his pipe and have no
fear of having his head kicked off.
Propelling Attachment for Skiffs.
Samuel N. Smith of Minneapolis, Minn.,
is the inventor of a propelling and steer
ing attachment for small skiffs and row
boats that should be of great service to all
owners of pleasure craft on smooth waters.
It is so constructed that it can be fastened
to any boat in a few minutes and un
shipped as quickly and put away in a
place of safety, thereby preventing the
vessel from being Btolen and also being
tampered with.
The general shape of this contrivance is
like a rudder, the propeller being located
at the point where the blade would besand
the motor being fastened on the handle.
It is all made so as to swing freely from
side to side. The method of shipping and
unshipping is by a specially constructed
plate and a clamping attachment held in
place by a pin that can be easily taken out
or replaced.
The principle upon which Mr. Smith
has worked in his construction might be
called the "tube" principle. All the work
ing gear is inclosed in tuoes, and the or
dinary square gearing is used in convert
ing the power from one angle to another.
The motor is really no part of the inven
tion and can be either spring or electric.
The principle on which the apparatus
works ought to be a saving of power.
There is no pressure against the rudder
blades to cau'e friction. If the propeller
is placed at a line following the keel the
vessel will be driven straight ahead. If
turned to one side or the other the stern
of the vessel will De driven in a corre
sponding direction and so cause the prow
to turn as desired. The greater the angle
at which the propeller is turned the
sharper turn the vessel will make.

THE STAGE
Last week's post-election offerings were
not quite all the press agent's fancy had
painted them. We had two fairly good
vaudeville operas, a pretty Strauss opera
which lacked the charm of novelty, t%
mildly military melodrama at the Grand,
and a melodrama with clanking chains
and howling wolves at the California; the
Alcazar pcave us a romantia new play, and
the Orpheum cheered us on our way with
some new dogs and a string of holdovers â
all very pleasing in their way, but scarcely
thank-offerings for the results of the elec
tion.
Delia Fox, as a star, showed herself to
have just enough brilliancy to twinkle suc
cessfully, with the support of some fairly
bright liehts around her. The most care
ful astronomical observations failed to dis
cover any extraordinary effulgency. Miss
Fox is a clever little worker, however, and
is blessed with just that suggestion of the
music hall wh eh gives the finishing
touch to the charms of an operetta prima
donna.
If Messrs. Belasco, Jordan and La Faille
had sought far and wide they could not
have found a better foil to May Buckley's
pretty acting in "Reaping the Harvest"
than the fiery, untamed eloquence of
Beatrice Lieb as t c revengeful mother.
" This lady is wasting her talents on the
desert air when she bestows them on
drawing-room comedy. She shou d as
cend tne rostrum and declaim "Curfew
bhall Not Ring To-Night" or "The Dream
of Eugene Aram." Amelo'rama might,
perchance, be found of sufficient strength
to afford an outlet for her energy, but I
cannot think of one declamatory enough
to fi.l the bilL Beatrice Lieb is a comely
young woman and dresses beautifully
â aithal, but when she turns herself loose â
like the lady in "Nicholas Nickleby" who
let down her bactc hair and recited "The
Blood-Drinker's Funeral" â the exhibition
is enougn to make the bravest quail. No
wonder the future baronet, her husband,
fled from his duties. The only surprise
was that he had fortitude to support Miss
Lieo's oratory for five lone years.
Every time I see May Buckley at the
Alcazar confirms my impression that
she is an exceptionally gifted young
actress, on the threshold of a bright
career. Not only is this little maiden of
20 simpie, unaffected and winning, but
she possesses the rare power of conveying
her emotions to the audience so naturally
that you would vow she was not acting at
all. It looks very easy to be utterly un
conventional on the stage, but if you care
fully note and mentally digest the con
duct of the rank and fiie of players you
will realize that it is by no means so easy
as it looks.
Most of the ranK and file of the dramatic
proJession fret and fume and pace up and
down the stage like caged animals in a
zoological garden. If they sit down on a
cnair or a sofa they bounce up immedi
ately, as if they had accidentally depos
ited themselves on a red-hot move, and
they do not seem to know peace of mind
or body either sitting, standing or walk
ing. Some actors, with malice afore
thought, cultivate this fnssiness and call
it spirited action, and truth compels me
to say that many patrons of the drama
admire perpetual motion. Perhaps Miss
Burlcley'a simplicity appeals strongly to
me because I happen to be an ardent ad
mirer of the French and Italian schools
which have us Constant Coquelin,
Duse and Novelli. I worshiped at Dune's
shrine before she was discovered in Amer
ica. A superlative artist she is who can,
and does, convey every shade of feeling
and emotion of which the human heart is
capable without o'erstepping the modesty
of nature or violating even the smallest
conventionality of the life she portrays. It
is not my intention to compare Miss Buck
ley to Duse, but the touch of naturalness
in her acting Bhows that she, too, has a
gleam of the truth which illumines the
great tragedienne.
May Buckley is not the only clever
playerin the Alcazar Company. Sulli
van and several of its members are doing
excellent work. If the present pressure
of enterprise is kept up there is no know
ing what heights may not be attained by
the little theater that was once said to be
under the ban of a boodoo.
I want to suggest to the lady suffragists
a means of "getting the bulge" on those
men who say that only the hand that
wields the sword should wield the ballot.
During the next campaign iet them get a
good assortment of heroines of melodrama
and sprinkle them judiciously about
the Slate for electioneerine purposes, to
tell the voters what woman has dared and
done in the cause of right against might,
if the men who believe that oelhgerency
and voting go hand in hand are true to
their principles they will be led to the
polls to vote aolid for suffrage like sheep
led to the slaughter.
Notable to fight! why those heroines
would soon prove that they had dared
more, ayel and achieved more, than
Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar and
Napoleon I, ail rolled into one. Look
what girls were doing at the Grand Opera
house and the California Theater last
week I Does history record that Alexander
the Great ever took a whole troop of sol
diers prisoners and confined them in his
kitchen cellar by the might of his good
right arm alone? Dorothy did the deed
at the Grand, not once, but every night
last week, and the house took it au grand
seri- v and cheered her to the echo.
Even Dorothy's prowess pales before the
deeds done by Ilda of "Darkest Russia"
fame. In addition to defying aristocrats,
standing off armed nihilists and snatching
convicts from the iron grasp of the law,
this frail girl "nursed a garrison through
an epidemic, and then, rifle in hand, re
pulsed an attack of the Turcomans." Does
not that feat appropriate the confec
tionery? Julius Caesar, if he'd had a rifle,
might have found courage to stand off an
attack of the Turcomans, but if you had
put him, single-handed, to nurse a garri
son through an epidemic, it's ten to one
that instead of being a ministering angel
Julius Caesar would have used language
unfit for publication.
And yet strong men sit at melodramas,
clapping their hands and crying "Brava !
Bravissima!" when one frail woman re-
pulses an army, and afterward they go
out and say, "Women can't fight."
I visited "Darkest Russia" with an ex
tra handkerchief in my pocket and a grim
foreboding in my heart that the next two
hours and a half would be passed under a
funereal pall of tear-extracting gloom. Of
course it is the unexpected that always
bar-pens, and before penetrating very far
into Grattan Donnelly' Â« "darkest" 1 was
enjoying myself hugely, having decided
that the California's show was the most
cheerful production in townâ humor is
always more inspiriting when it is uncon
scious. The whole audience seemed to be
of this opinion, for they caueht on to the
funny points which enliven the tragical
moments and applauded rapturously and
hilariously.
According to Grattan Donnelly there
are no law courts in Russia. The Chief of
Police has things all his own way. He
can accost the most harmless citizen with
"Off to Siberia," and the sentence at once
becomes as irrevocable as the laws of the
Medes and the Persians. This fell official
does not need his sentences to be wit
nessed, or signed or sealed with his hand.
All he does is to say, "Siberia for ten
years," and the decree is at once executed
with neatness and dispatch. In one scene
everybody who is anybody is sent to Si
beria, and the "Off-with-his-beadâ so
much-for-Buckingham" air with which
the thing is done beeins in agony, but
works up to a fine climax of farce before
the dramatis personse are all disposed of.
The strance, eventful history of "Dark
est Russia" centers round two pairs of
lovers, who are good and virtuous with
the pristine virtue of melodrama. One of
the heroes, Ivan Barosky, has resisted all
temptations to become a nihilist, perhaps
because the nihilists have a most unpleas
ant habit of holding illicit meetings in his
cellar, and threatening him with paint
and penalties if he wants to disiodge them.
Barosky, who is a brave man, has tempted
exile by secretly marrying the daughter of
the terrible Chief of Police, and Barosky's
sister Ildaâ l wish they'd make it Hilda
is beloved by an officer of high degree
whom the Chief of Police and his wicked
Countess covet lor a son-in-law. Through
a combination of circumstances the lovers
all meet in the nihilist-hauntea cellar
right in the thick of a plot to kill the Czar.
Their advent naturally irritates the con
spirators, from whose wrath they have
hairbreadth escapes. The lovers are finally
rescued from the clntches of the nihilists
by the officers of the law and are led away
to await the sentence of the Chief of Po
lice, who represents the whole judicial
authority of the empire.
The Chief, who has no idea that his own
daughter has been captured, scorns such a

down on a general feeling of "We shall
meet anon in Siberia."
Of course, the exiling game is absurdly
exaggerated, but, after all, exaggeration
is a characteristic of melodrama. Even
its most fervid admirers take melodrama
with a grain of saltâ a good many grains
of salt â and with this seasoning "Darkest
Russia" is an excellent play of its kind.
The act where every one meets in Siberia,
if a little complicated, 1s very thrilling,
and the whole play is vividly picturesque j
and rings agreeable changes on the hack- '
neyed melodrama of English-speaking !
life. As for its bits of unconscious hu- j
mor, they liven up the play. Why should j
we pay out bard-earned dollars and get
in return nothing Dut gloom and woe?
Humor, especially unconscious humor, is
worth paying for.
Captain James A. Herne mi/ht have
found foes more worthy of their steel for
his "Minute Men" than the lamb-like
red coats who were all captured at one
fell swoop by a pretty youns; lady. These
base hirelings of an effete monarchy never
so much as crooked a finger in their own
defense; evidently tliev had been engaged
at so much a night by Manager Morosco
to be cap ured, and their contract did not
call for the display of any violence, even
if the exigencies of the drama had allowed
of it. Leslie, the red-coat officer, yielded
his sword and pistol to ail girl conqueror
with a Chesterfieliiian grace which would
have done more credit to the court than to
the camp. The fact is that Captain
Herne's ideas of warfare se m to be of
the "Ladies first" order. His officers
never for a moment forget that they are
gentlemen, and the gentlemen in the
ranks would fall upon iheir own bayonets
rather than be guilty of anything
so vulgar as mak ing broils or disturbances.
It is all very reiined and hightoned to
represent King Georee's soldiers t us, but
the next time Captain Herne writes a I
military melodrama, he should not forget {
to season the foe with some blood and j
thunder. Captnrine thee.emy is all very j
well as a climax, but the gallery likes to j
see a well-foucbt strngtjle, and resents
being balked of its gore.

McCarthy is a name to conjure with at
the Orpheum. The man who proudly
wears tnat appellation is a stagehand,
who is beloved by the habitues of the
theater on account of the accomplished
way in which ho does a modest turn
I when any of the teams stand in need of a
tail man to be knocked iff a table, have
his hat kickrdoff, or otherwise mi ke him
self invaluable from a vaudeville stand
point.
But McCarthy has aspirations. He
often think- he could improve on tne act*.
He does not say so. at least he never did
say so till the other day, when McCarthy
was heard to murmur iliat if Jasper were
his, he would each that intelligent ani
mal to perform in a way that would slm
plv paralyze the audience.
No one paid heed to McCarthy's aspii
ing remark at the time, for no one t-uessed
what the vaulting ambition which was fer
menting in his brain would lead to.
The other morning, when the stage was
deserted, McCarthy led out the gentle
Jasper â who, by the way. is a tricfc don
keyâand beg;m to urge him to go through
the accomplishments he performs with
his master^, Jenkins and Clayton. One
of Jasper's chief feats is pretending to
bit* and chasing his would-be rider across
the stage. McCarthy soon found to his
sorrow tbat Jasper possessed even more
intelligence than he had given him credit
for. The donkey saw at a glance that the
stagenand was not one of his owners and
chased him across the stasre and bit him
in dead earnest. Then ensued a terrible
scrimmage. Jasper tried to annihilate
McCarthy and McCarthy dodged him
around pcenery and property-tables and
chairs When Jasper could not get
around the scenery fast enough he bioke
through it as easily as a circus-rider bursts
through a paper-covered lioop, and the
way in which he cleared tables and chairs
would have done credit to a steeplechase.
McCarthy's cries finally brought assist
ance to the scene in time to save him from
heine strewn about the stage in fragments,
but lie presented a torn, bitten and alto
gether pitiable appearance. The stage
looked as if it had passed through the St.
Louis cyclone, and the only thing in 6is:ht
that had not suffered from t c fray was
the triumphant Jasper. He was led away
looking as good as new.
Delia Fox has discovered since she be
gan her stellar career what a vast number
of persons there are who have "one of the
best things on earth" which would be
helped most materially by her written in
dorsement. She has received enough
samples of face powder to keep her chorus
in make-up for a year, and the supply of
fancy soaps has been of a wholesale de
scription. Bottles of new perfumery have
become a drug, and all these things are
forwarded with a request that the lady
will kindly sample them and return a
written indorsement to the sender. Comic
opera librettos from unknown authors,
and usual y with insufficient postage on
them, arrive. To thoso must be added
large batches of songsâ comic, pathetic
and sentimental â exactly suited to Miss
Fox's voice, and all guaranteed (by the
composer) to make a hit. Hats chastened
for Her as a rule annoy Miss Fox more
than any other of the multifarious arti
cles to which people htive attached her
name, for the reason that she hat never
yet seen one of them in which she did not
look like a fright.
BaldWirv Jheater.
To-morrow evening Delia Fox will ap
pear in her successful opera, "Fleur-de-
Lis." This lyric work is of French ex
traction, and had a long and successful
run at Palmer's Theater, New York. It
affords Miss Fox six changes of costume in
the way o: concealing her identity. The
plot hinges on the disagreement of two
lile-long friends, the Marquis de Rosolio
and the Coant dcs E-ciirbilles, over the
ownership of a French estate. Of course
the comic element is mucti in evidence,
and there isa stmin of love-making, giv
ing Miss Fox plenty to do in this line.
Nat C. Goodwin will follow Delia Fox at
the .Baldwin.

Davies, for the first time in this City, to

est play on William A. Brady's list. The

and tells of Hartling incidents by flood
and field. The heroine lives in feouth
Africa, and the i ero, a lieutenant of the
.British army, has his home on his ances
tral estates in England. The characters
meet in England, but later repair to
goutn Africa. The scenes include a bat
tle with the Boers and a sword contest on

be taken off the boards and an American
military drama new to this City produced.
It is in four acts and the action takes

raso. The story is said to be full oi love
and comedy and one 01 its most suiiuiiE
leatures is a sword duel between the
heroine and the villain. She rescues her
sweetheart just as he is wounded, and
ura.ping the sword from his hands she
succeeds in suoduinur her opponent. Miss

wheat from bath coasts for week as given by Brad
! street's (4,644,000 bushels) were apparently dis
counted or their effect was at least offset by" a de- \
cline of %d at Liverpool to-day. Prices were fairly
steady at the opening of the wheat market this
morning, but that feeling quickly gave wav to one
of weakness. Reports of rain la India tended to
emphasize the declining tendency. Receipts in
the Northwest snow some increase over those of
the past few days, 684 cars arriving, against 775
last Saturday and 1079 a year ago.- Chicago re
ceived 78 cars and inspected out 32.100 bushels- |
Argentine shipments were 80,000 bushels of wheat
last week. Closing Continental cables were lowÂ»r
lor Berlin, nlgher for Paris and partly lower to

' wan vet 4i' too hiah. Exrnr: clearances were Us lit

WRANGLING FOR
A SCHOOL SITE
Residents of Rival Sec
tions Entertain the
Board.
The Mission High School CTub
Makes a Vigorous Fight for
a Favored Lot.
ARGUMENT THAT WAS WARM.
In the Heat of Controversy George
Center and Attorney Van Duz?r
Exchange Compliments.
Nine members of the Board of Educa
tion met by appointment at the Horace
Mann School yesterday afternoon, when
they proceeded to the various sites sug
gested for the new Mission High School.
The appointment was for the entire board
as a committee of the whole, but Directors
Clinton, Soper, Hawiey, Henderson, Knox,
Carew, McElroy, Comte and Murdock were
all that showed up at the trysting place.
No attempt at a formal meeting was made.
As each Director reached the schoolhouse
gate he was buttonholed by a member of
the Mission High School Club, and the
views of that organization as to school
sites were emphatically impressed on his
memory.
The Mission High Schcoi Club, which
has fostered th- school project from its
incipiency, is decidedly in favor of the lot
at the southeast corner of Guerrero and
Twenty-third streets.
This^ they argued, is the center of the
Mission population and by reason of street
car facilities is accessible to every portion
of that ilis rict. Failing in securing this
Bite they would be satisfied with a lot at
Twenty-fourth and Valencia streets and
they do not object very strenuously to a
lot which has been considered at Twenty
seventh and Army streets. Tuey do ob
ject, and this with energy only limited to
tbeir capacity, to the new ed fice being
located at Twentieth and Folsom streets.
It was this objection that caused ail the
on pleasantness.
The Directors, as soon as it became ap
parent that no more members were com
ing, repaired at once to the property
which is the first ci.oice of the club. John
H. Grady, president of tue club, and A. P.
Van Duzer, the attorney, with numerous
enthusiastic cluD members, were at the
selected corner wailing to welcome the
Directors.
The lot favored is 280x200 feet and runs
through from Twenty-third street to
Elizabeth, fronting 280 feet on Guerrero.
The price asied is $60,000. Its virtues
were duly pointed out to the critical Di
rectors, but with the majority the enthu
siasm of the club members was not conta
gious. The members argued until they
got red in the face, but no apparent effect
was produced upon what looked like a
hopeless majority of those present.
"Let's go and look at the ideai site on
Folsom street," exclaimed youne Mr.
Hawley as he iumped into a bugey with
Director McElroy ant 1 a real estate dealer.
The club members looked fclum.
No particular attention wa- paid to the
other sites, as they apparently had neither
advocates nor opponents. Some of the
Directors visited the Army-street property
and the Crim property on Howard street,
between Nineteenth and Twentieth, but no
slop was made.
At Folsom street A. B. and W. J.
Maguire, George Center and others awaited
the arrival of the delegation with the
proverbial blood in the eyes. They were
mad all over. The night before at a meet
ing of the Mission Club reso utions had
been passed denouncing the Folsom-street
site as a marsh with a brewery upon one
corner of it and railroad trains passing in
annoyint; proximity every two hours.
Unpleasant mention was also made of the
Pestbouse, County Sospital and Magdalen
Asylum as beine neij;nbors all too near.
The local residents were out in defense of
their neigiiborbood, and upon Attorney
Van Duzer they glared as the author of
their grievances.
"Where is that swamp?" demanded A.
B. Maguire. The sentiment was echoed
by his brother, and George Center em
phasized it.
Van Duz r invited the crowd to take a
walk around the block with him. On the
far side of the block from the proposed
site the at orney triumphantly pointed out
a depression. Then A. B. Maguire gath
ered th.c Directors about him and delivered
an impassioned address, the burden ol
which was that the depression was only
apparent, being due to the fact that the
surrounding land had been hiied in. He
said strong things of the statement that
the locality was a swamp, and declared the
resolutions of the Mission Club were ma
licious lies.
In the shade of the Broadway Brewery,
on the outside, the Directors and residents
carried oo a warm argument for hfteen
minutes. Director Knox became c oquent
in his defense of the Folsom-street site.
"Are you here as a School Director?"
asked Van Duzer.
Knox declared that he was.
'Then," said Van Duzer, "I would ad
viss you not to be so enthusiastic."
The noise of a passing train interrupt d
the conversation for a few seconds. That
started the argument â¢on the disadvan
tages of a neig boring railroad. The Fol
som-street people declared the same con
dition prevailed at Twenty-third street.
As the party left the viciniiy of the
Brewery Geor.e Center and Van Duzer
came very near getting into a scrimmage.
"Any man who says that is a swamp
lies," declared Center.
"I repeat that it is a swamp," retorted
Van Duzer.
"Then you lie," said Center.
But there was no blood shed. Van
Duzer simply warned Center to be care
ful, and declared he could not be drawn
into a personal encounter.
After leaving Folsom street the club
memoers felt very blue, and repeatedly
declared that they seemed to be beaten.
Hawiey, Carew, Henderson, McElroy and
Knoz gave unmistakable evidence of
being favorably impressed with the Fol
som-street property. Comte had made
his investigations alone, and so wÂ«s an un
known quantity. Clinton and Soper were
non-committal, and Murdock alone
seemed openly to favor tne Twenty-triird
etreet property.
As Van Dnzer and his followers left the
scene Dr. Clinton went by in his bugey.
Van Duzer hailed him and commenced ex
plaining the unsanitary features of the
Folsom-street property.
"That lot is not unsanitary," declared
the doctor.
"Now, doctor," said Van Duzer, ap
pealingly, "we thought you were with us."
The doctor explained that he was with
them, but he tidn't Know what they
wanted. He spoKe warmly of the Folsom
street sitt*.
"To think they have elected that man
Super visor," said Van Duzer, as the doctor
drove ..way.
The club is circulating s. protest which
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1596.
it intends to file with the Board -of Educa
tion. It objects tot c Folaom-street prop
erty on the grounds:
Firstâ That It is on the extreme eastern
boundary of the district and the population is
mostly to trie west aud southwest.
Second â The locality is not a residence dis
trict. On one corner of the block <.ff t-red is the
Broadway Brewery. Directly oppo-ite. on two
other corners, are saloons. On the opposite
fide of the street, on the north, are large steam
dyeing and cleaning establishments; the
nauseating tunics of which pervade the entire
vicinity. The easterly portion of the proposed
block for many years has been and now is a
puD:ic 'lump, and is a nuisance and a met- ace
to public nealth.
Thirdâ The proposed site itself is in a basin
only tweniy-eiglit feet above baÂ«e level and is
the lowest point within an area of one miie.
Bring hi a basin there is no adequate st-WHge.
Fourthâ The County HotplUl, Macda.en
Asyluui and Leper Hospital are situated in the
immediate vicinity, being but a few blocks
awa* 1 . The whole nelgnbornood to the east
and north is devoted exclusively to manufac
turing and hat. been so for thirty years and
always will be devoted to such industries.
Further thau this the Bite is declared to
be inaccessible to any but one line of
streetcars, while the main track of the
Southern Pacific Railroad crosses the
main street within a tew blocks of the site
and will endanger the lives of the
students, as the trains are passing every
hour.
"To locate this expensive school in this
inconvenient malarial and dangerous
locality," the protest concludes, "would
be a great wrong to the residents and
property-owners of the Mission."
The Folsom-street property is the
cheapest yet offered, the price for 200x245
feet being $39,000. It is evident that a
majority of the Directors out yesterday
favor this site.
LICK BATHS OVERHAULED.
Liberty Branch of the Socialist Labor
I'arty llai Something to Say.
Liberty branch of the Socialist Labor
party bad a good attendance at its meet
ing Friday night. R. A. Cupeland was hon
ored with tne office of librarian of the
society, and Theodore Lynch was elected
chairman for the mass-meating to be held
on the lSih inst. at the Turk-street Tem
ple.
The question of the management of the
Lick baths, as made pub.ic in the columns
of The Call a few uays ago, was brought
up for discussion at the meeting, and alter
a prolonged debate the following resolution
was adopted:
Whereas, At a meeting of the board of trus
teesoi tne James Lick baths, held October 15,
1896, it was decided to raise the price charged
fur bHth-. and the usual supplies from 5 to 10
cents; and whereas, s-iid baths were intended
by James Lick to be free to the public, to
wnom ne generously donated the meant for
the ampie maintenance of such batbs, free
from petty proflt-raoDKerinK charges that in
validate his will and gift.
Resolved, That the San Francisco Trades and
Labor Alliance, in regu.ar weekly meeting
a-it'iubed, hereby censure the said Board of
Trustees for incompetency in the management
of said baths, and for violating the will and
purpose of James Lick.
It'.KOlved, Also, that a decent respect for the
public (in this connection the legatees of
James Lick) should have prompted the said
trustees to render an accounting to the pub.ic,
ana let it judge from the facts instead of from
the board s dicta as 10 whether or not an
increased charge was necessary.

TWIN DAUGHTERS
CRUELLY ABUSED
Helen and Catherine Hutch
inson Want to Be
Protected.
Beaten With Straps and Iron
Rods by Tbeir Hard-
Hearted Father.
AGAIN HE THREATENS THEM.
Seeks to Send His Little Girls to a
Home for Fallen Worn nâob
j:Ctions Raised.
Judge Seawell of the Superior Court has
taken under advisement the application
to compel Joseph W. Hutchinson to con
tribute $25 a month for the support of his
twin daughters, Helen and Catherine.
The suit is tiled by the guardian ad
litem, who hns riled an affidavit setting
forth many reprehensible acts on the part
ot Ilutchinson, many of the particulars
having been already published.
According to the most recent affidavit
Huichinson persists in his desire to mis
treat his daughters, and the court is asked
to compel iiim to do a part of his duty, so
far as financial assistance to his offspring
is concerned at least.
Helen and Catherine Hutchinson are the
two little girls who were discovered by the
police living under the front porcn of an
unoccupied house in the Mission about
two years ago. They were then 13 years
of age, but now they are 15, and are just
budding into womanhood.
When the girls were discovered under
tde poich they were in a most deplorable
condition. It was ascertained that their
mother being dead their father had neg
lected and abused them in a shameiul
manner. According to the court records
they compla ned that their lather drove
them from their home by beating them
witu a leather strap and with an iron
poker. He threatened to kill them, which
frightened them so ;hat they ran away
and for nine nights slept under the porch,
making that tneir only resting-place until
they were apprehended by the police.
Their father was notified of tue fact that
the little ones were being held by the
police and he went to the station and ot
them, hut instead of taking t< em home he
took them at once to th- "new City Had,
where he turned them over to the police
authorities, bidding them good-by and in
forming tiiern that he intended to leave
them permanently in tue hands oi the
authorities.
After some delay ttie girls were tnken to
the Hill Hume, a place of refuse for friend
less girls, and subsequently a guardian was
appointed to properly care for them and to
secure jotnc financial aid from the father.
He paid $25 a month for inree month , and
then grew weary. On the 4th of last month
he made a demand on the guardian for the
return of his daughters, alleging that he
could better care for them if they were
under his personal control.
To this demand Attorney W. H. Jordan,
appearing lor the lady who is acting as the
girls' guardian, makes strenuous objec
tion. In the affidavit riled in Judge bea
well's court, it is alleged i bat the guardian
believes that if Hutchinson regains con
trol of his daughters that he will once
more maltreat them as he did before.
The guardian declares that the father of
the children has threatened to send his
daughters to a home or fallen women so
soon as he regains control of them, and it
is believed that his application for tbeir
return to his custody is made with this
object in view.
The guardian avers that she has had an
opportunity to carefully observe the con
duct of the girls, and she informs the
court that "the said Helen and Catherine
Hutchinson are mild-mannered, well
behaved, gentle chiMren."
She declares that to send them to a home
for fallen women would be an outrage on
them and a degradation that they in no
wise deserve.
Tue petition closes with a request that
Hutchinson be compelled to contribute a
proper amount each month for the sun
port of the children he so cruelly cast off.
After hearing the affidavits and listen
ing to the arguments of counsel Judge
Seawell ordered the matter submitted,
promising a decision at an early day.
Won by a .Narrow Margin.
The Election Commissioners, in their can
vass of the ballots cast at the last election,
finished up the Forty-third Assembly District
yesterday and confirmed the result of the
count for the Assembly. The official canvass
showed that the unofficial count was correct,
an<l that Leon Dennery won by seven votes.
