Republican Landslides in
the Pine Tree State's
Election.
PLURALITIES GREATEST
ON RECORD.
Powers Chosen Governor by a
Vote Fifty Thousand Greater
Than Others Received.
ALL THE FOUR CONGRESSMEN
ARE RETURNED.
In Sewall's Own Ward the Demo
crats Are Snowed Under Too
Deep lor Recovery.
PORTLAND, Mb., Bept. 14.â Tne cam
paign which culminated to-day in the
greatest Republican victory ever recorded
in this State has been the most active
Known for years upon both sides. It has
been a speaking campaign almost entirely
and the entire State has been well
covered.
There were five candidates for the office
of Governor, who is the only State officer
chosen by the people, all others being
chosen by the Legislature. The name of
one of these, Willi^n Henry Clifford of
Portland, the nominee of the Sound
money Democrats, was not upou the
official ballot, and those voting for him
were obliged to write his name upon their
ballots. The other candidates were: Hon.
Llewellyn Powers of Houlton, Republi
can; Hon. Melviu P. FranK of Portland,
Democrat; Arami S. Ladd of Calais, Pro
hibitionist; and Luther C. Bateman of
Auburn, Populist.
Congressmen, county officers, State Sena
tors and representatives in the Legislature
were also elected. The average estimate
of the Republican plurality for Governor
was 25,000 to 28,000 as compared with
about 38,000 in 1894 and 12,500 in 1892, but
the vote to-day througnoat the State was
larger than anticipated and the plurality
of Powers, the Republican, is larger than
the most enthusiastic Republican dared
predict, the latest returns indicating that
it will reach nearly 50,000.
In nearly every county the county
officers are Republican by much larger
pluralities than ever before known, and
iv some counties no candidates were put
in the field by the Democrats. In all four
of the Congressional districts the incum
bents were re-elected.
In the First District Reed's plurality
will be over 10,000, as against 8815 two
years ago, while Congressmen Dingley,
Milliken and Boutelle will go back to the
next Congress with a much larger vote
than two years ago.

MOST SWEEPING VICTORY.
On* of the Great tit Triumphs Ever
'Achieved in Mo inc.
AUGUSTA, Mb., Sept. 14.â Hon. Joseph
H. Manley to-night sent the following
telegram:
Augusta, Me., Sept. 14.
Hon. M. A. Hanna, Chairman National Repub
lican Committee, Chicago: The Republicans nave
achieved this day the most sweeping and mag
nificent victory ever accorded to a party in the
history of Maine.
We have carried every county In the State;
elected every State Senator and at least 140
out of 151 * members of the House
of Representatives; secured every county
officer; given each men-, her of our
magnificent delegation to the House of Rep
resentatives the 'largest majority they
ever received; elected our candidate for
Governor by the largest . . majority ever
given a candidate for that high office; in
dorsed the St. Louis platform, Â«nd declared
for WcKinley and Hobart by 50,000 plurality.
Â» The Republican vote will exceed by j
I^Beveral thousand the largest . Republl-J
can vote heretofore given, and thel
vote given the Democratic candidate forl
Governor is the smallest Democratic vote everl
The San Francisco Call
cast, with one single exception, and that is the
vote of 1894, which was only 3000 less.
We have kept pace with Vermont and proven
to the country that the Democratic platform
adopted at Chicago will not prevail when met
by argument and reason.
We have been aided in this great contest by
many Democrats who placed country above
party, who believed that you could not
divide the people into two parties upon a
question of simple morals and common hon
esty. They share our victory with us.
What more could Maine have done for the
cause of good government, honest money and
protection ? â¢ J. H. Manley.
GREAT JOY IN NEW YORK
the Victory in Maine Far Ahead of
nhat Was trprcted.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 14.â There
was great joy among the Republican lead
ers over the Maine election. Both Na
tional and State headquarters were held
open until a late hour.
When Mr. Manley telegraphed that the
Republican majority would reach 50,000,
there was great surprise and enthusiasm.
Many expected to witness a strong senti
ment in Maine as a reflex on the green
back feelin<* some years ago, but the re
sult of to-day, closely following that in
Vermont, is regarded as a cyclone on the
free-silver decline so far as the East is
concerned. The National Democracy,
through one of its leaders, Mr. Tracey of
Albany, expressed satisfaction at the re
sult.
COLLAPSE OF A CAPITALIST.

DES MOINES, lowa, Sept. 14.â D. U.
Lyons, capitalist and broker, made an
assignment to C. S. Bradshaw to-day for
the benefit of his creditors. Mr. Lyons
has been prominent In financial circles,

His direct liabilities are $77,179, of which
$49 500 is bills payable and the balance in

ROBBED BY A SYNDICATE
Systematic Audacity of the New
Orleans National Bank
Wreckers.
S?ven Persons Were in the Deal an.
They Lived Like Princes Until
the Collapse.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 14.â A Bun
special from New Orleans says:
There is only one more secret to come
out in the wrecking of the Union Nations.
Bank and the bank panic which ra^ed
here last we k, and it is announced that it
will be disclosed within the next twenty
four hours; that is, the names of the con-
federates â the men on the outside who
drew out and appropriated the $602,000 oi
the bank's money. The bookkeepers
cooked the accounts, so as to keep the
bank always in debt to tnese confederates.
The bank was robbed by a syndicate
composed of seven per-ons, two on the in
side of the bank and five on the outside.
The whole transaction was business-like
and systematical, including the division
of the funds. Colomb, one of the book
keepers, whose lack of nerve was shown
by his suicide the moment suspicion
pointed to him, was the organizer of the
project and its director. It is reported
that a confiscation has been made, that
three members of the syndicate have been
arrested and that the only reason names
are not now made public is to prevent any
escape, as some of them are out of town.
The money went mainly in riotous living,
the balance in speculation, with the hope
of recovering the amount stolen.
In the big cotton speculation last year,
when cotton went up so high, the syndi
cate was ahead of the game. The sudden
collapse of the market prevented it from
making good the bank's money and ren
dered a new raid necessary. The bank
has been plundered more heavily than
ever since.
The outside men are said to be hieh
livers. Not so the bookkeepers, who were
kept busy all day covering up their mis
deeds. They had no time for a spree.
Colomb spent most of his share on
his family. He lived luxuriously, had ten
sprvants and a housekeeper, a rather
large household for a clerk on a saiary
of $150 a month. He Dad determined on
suicide when^the defalcation came out, for
he carried poison on his person to be used
at a moment's notice. He had many
friends, and they all speak of him as gen
erous and brave, and say that to commit
suicide was the only thing a gentleman
could do under the circumstances.
Colomb was interviewed about the
bank's condition. He was calm and col

SAN FRANCISCO, TUESDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 15, 1896.
Tom Reed â "Just wait till next November. This is only a sample/
lected then and apparently in the best of
inruor, although it was only a few hours
oefore his death, and he had tien evi
dently determined on suicide. He did not
leli his family of his intention, and it was
not until several hours later that he took
the poison and was discovered in an in
sensible condition. Oace or twice in the
next thirty-six hours he opened his eyes
and looked around the room, but he
neither spoke nor seemed to know any one.
t'olOmb's death renders the work of in
vestigating the defalcation very difficult,
and United States Bank Examiner Escott
loubts whether it will ever be possible to
know all the details.
The receivers of the Bank of Commerce
and the American National Bank will take
possession of them to-morrow. The two
other closed banks, the Mutual National

hands of the United States Examiners.
it is thought the panic is over and that
there will be no more trouble.

ANARCHY AT CONSTANTINOPLE.
Turks Threaten to Blow Up the British
Embassyâ Lives and Property of AH
Foreigners in Peril.
LONDON, Exo., Sept. 14.â The Standard
will to-morrow publish a dispatch from
Constantinople saying that threats are be
ing made to blow up the new public
ffices and the British embassy. The un
rest among the low-class Turks is increas
ing. It is now not a question of Turk
against Armenian, but of the lives and
property of all foreign citizens in the city.
The patrols have been doubled every
where, but if the Government should order
the soldiers to fire upon a mob, it is likely
tnat the order would be disobeyed and
that the troops would fraternize with the
rioters.
SACRAMENTO'S FATAL BLAZE

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 14.â The
Capital Furnituie Factory burned this

VANCOUVER, B. C, Sept. 14.â Li Hung
Chang, who is leaving this continent to
day for China, shows remarkable vigor for
a man of his years. He arose early this
morning, having appointed 8 o'clock as
the hour to begin receiving deputations,
and until noon he was occupied in irivine
audiences to the Board oi Trade, the City
Council, the foreign Consuls resident in
Vancouver and the Lieutenant-Governor
of the province. He sailed on the Em

Skeletons Fauna Mear Wettport.
ASTORIA, Ob., Bept. 14.â Graders on
the line of the Astoria and Columbia
River Railroad, near Westport, unearthed
the skeletons of two white men to-day.
Muskets of ancient model were found be
side them. The only other article found
was a $20 gold piece, dated 1855. The
skeletons had evidently been buried many
years. Oldest residents of the locality
have no recollection of the burial or dis
appearance of the two men.
THE SCOTTS WIN
A BATTLE-SHIP
Union Iron Works to Build
One of Three New
Fighters.
TO ECLIPSE THE OREGON
Means a Rush of Work at the
Potrero tor the Next
Two Years.
GREAT HEWS FOB THE COAST.
Dimensions Giving an laea of the
Formidable Character of the
Ocean Warrior.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 14.â There
was remarkably close bidding on the de
partmental plans alone, and figures were
low, considering the financial agitation, at
the competition at the Navy Department
to-day for the throe new battle-ships, the
Newport News company, the Scotts of San
Francisco and the Cramps of Philadelphia
each winning a ship from among the five
bidders.
The welcome news was received from
Washington yester (ay that the Union Iron
Works had gained the contract for building
one of the three high-class modern battle
ships authorized by Congress at the last
session. In the telegraphic columns the
story of the bidding is told. The first in
telligence of the success was conveyed in a
private dispatch from Henry T. to Irving
M. Scott, of which the following is a copy:
Washington, D. C, Sept. 14, 1896.
To Union Iron Workt, San Francttco: Under
our 4 per cent bid have ship at $2,675,000.
New York to-night. Bully 1 H. T. Scott.
According to the plans the new battle
ship is to represent the highest style of
naval architecture and will be the superior
of the Oregon in weight and larger in
dimension. In a general way the new
ship will bear a close resemblance to the
Kearsarge and lowa, but will contain some
improvements suggested by the naval
architects.
Surely the three vessels will constitute
a remarkably fine addition to the splendid
fleet of ocean-fighters which the United
States has placed in commission during
the past ten years.
The limit of cost fixed for each of the
three ships was $3,700,000, including hull
and armor. Word comes from Washington
that the armor can be supplied by the de
partment for less than $1,000,000. The
Union Iron Works was allowed a margin
of 4 percent above the lowest Eastern
bids tp offset the difference in prices
between the Atlantic and Pacific Coast.
It is a very important consideration to
the Government that there should be
maintained on the Pacific Coast ai least
one great ship-building establishment
capable of constructing, equipping and
repairing vessels of the largest class. The
ability of the Union Iron Works to
promptly build ships unexcelled for speed
and workmanship and conforming in
every respect to the specifications of the
depjrtment has been amply demonstrated
in the construction of the Oregon, Olym
pia, Monterey, San Francisco and Charles
ton. That another great success will be
scored in the building of a second battle
ship of vast proportions there can be no
doubt.
An idea of the formidable character of
the new battle-ship may be gained by a
study of these dimensions:
Length on load water line, 368 feet; molded
beam, 72 .feet; mean draft In normal displace
ment, 23 feet 6 inches; normal displacement,
11.500 .ons; total disp'acement, 12,500 tons;
total coal capacity, 1200 tons; horsepower,
12,000; speed, 16 knots per hour; belt armor,
16^ iuches tbick, 7 feet 6 inches deep; trans
verse armor, 12 inches; barbette armor, 15
inches; turrets, 17 inches; top of turret-, s}^
inches; protective deck, flat, 2% inches; pro
tective deck, slopes, 5 inches.
The battery will consist of four thirteen
inch rifled guns, fourteen six-inch rapid
fire guns, six six-pounders, four one
pounders, four machine guns and one
field piece. The ship will carry 200
rounds of ammunition for the thirteen
inch rifles, 2600 rounds for the six-inch
rapid-fire guns, 10.000 rounds for the six
pounders and 2400 rounds for the one
pounders. The ship will also carry four
broadside torpedoes and display four
searchlights.
Yesterday afternoon Irving M. Scott
was the recipient of many congratulations
over the success achieved in winning
another ship. It is regarded in one sense
as a victory for California. The building
of the formidable vessel will give employ
ment to an army of mechanics for two
years and perpetuate the activity which
has so long reigned at the Union Iron
Works.
The time allotted for the construction
of the new battle-ships is three years, but
if the Government is reasonably prompt
in supplying material the Union Iron
Works will do the work required at that
plant within two years. The extensive fa
cilities at hand, andjthe experience gained
particularly in the construction of the
Oregon, give assurance of ability to com
plete the enterprise in due time.
Next Friday, at Washington, the Navy
Department will open bids for building
three torpedo catchers. It is required that
these boats shall each attain a speed of
t'irty knots per hour. The Union Iron
Works is prepared to enter this field of
competition, where the highest speed is
demanded. Bids for the speedy catchers
are ready to be handed in.
LAWLESSNESS AT LEADVILLE.
Non-Union Miners Are Beaten and Pris
oners Boldly Taken From the
Arresting Officers.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Sept. 14.â Another
miner, named E. C. Terry, who wanted to
work in the Emma mine was assaulted
and fearlully beaten by unknown assail
ants at a late hour last night. His story
was told to the Sheriff, and an effort was
made to capture the guilty men to-day.
Late this afternoon officers entered a
saloon and arrested a man named Maho
ney. Before they could get their prisoner
out of the saloon, a group of miners as
saulted the officers, rescued Mahoney and
permitted him to.escape. The officers ar
rested a number of these men and took
them to jail. Tnese repeated outrages are
adding to the suppressed feelin? of the
public and Leadville awaits with great
anxiety the outbreak.
DENVER, Colo., Sept. 14.â A rumor is
afloat here to-day that the Chaffee Light
Artillery, which go to-night to Canyon
City to participate in th<? celebration of
Fruit day, carry with them ammunition
and supplies for a campaign, and that
they are to be held at Canyon City, so as
to be nearer Leadville in case a riot shall
break out.
ITALIAN BARK WRECKED
The Captain and Mate Lose
Their Wits and Commit
Suicide.
Seven ef the Crew Saved by Clinging
to the Rigging and Five Are
Drowned.
HIGHLAND LIGHT, Mass., Sept. 14.â
The Italian bark Monte Tabor, loaded with
salt, went on Peaked Hill bar at mid
night and shortly after bezan to break up.
The crew became panic-stricken. Even
the officers lost their wits.
The captain, F. Dellacassa, evidently
considering himself responsible for the
loss of the vessel, shot himself in the head
with a revolver and fell dead to the deck,
whence his body was soon afterward
washed into the sea.
The mate, believing death to be inevit
able and afraid of drowning, drew his
razor across his throat, producing a
ghastly wound and falling dead into the
water beside the doomed bark.
The crew, twelve in number, clung to
the deckhouse, expecting every minute to
be the last. The vessel held together for
about an hour and then went to pieces.
The twelve men went over the side still
clinging to the deckhouse. Five of them,
however, were unable to maintain their
hold and were soon drowned. The sur
vivors reached the shore in an exhausted
condition and were taken to the Peaked
Hill life-saving station, where they were
cared for.
The body of the mate was washed
ashore at Race Point at 9 o'clock. An
hour and a half later two other bodies
were found on the shore. One of these
men had followed the example of tne mate
and had cut his throat before beine swept
into the sea.
Tne Monte Tabor sailed from Trapani
July 31 for Boston.
SLAVIN KNOCKS OUT KITRAIN.
A Slogging Match Which Tern.inatet in

BALTIMORE, Ma.l Sept. 14.âEx-Cham
pion Jake Kilrain was knocked out by
Frank P. Slavin at the Eureka Club to
night. The Baltimore heavy-weight was
little better than a punching-bag for the
Australian, and it took him but two and a
quarter minutes to put the ex-champion
out.
Kilrain's weight was announced as 210
pounds, but he looked at least fifteen
pounds heavier. Slavm waighed 194.
The exhibition was more of tno give

two and a quarter minutes of fighting the
Baltimore man went down. His head
struck t c floor a resounding whack. He
rolled over and attempted to regain his
feet, but his hands were still on the floor
when the referee counted him out.

Scotland Yard Detectives Discover
the Plans of Assassination in
Time to Prevent Them.
LONDON, Enc, Sent. 14.â A communi
cation of a semi-official character was
issued this afternoon, touching the arrest
of the alleged dynamite conspirators. The
communication says, amone other things,
that the Scotland Yard officials have been
fully aware for some time past that a gang
of desperadoes has been engaged in
America in preparing the details and
arranging the ramifications of anexien
sive and diabolical plot to perpetrate a
dynamite outrage in England and estab
lish a reign of terror.
Chief inspector Melville of the Metro*
politan police has had charge of the Scot
land Yard arrangements for frustrating
the designs of the conspirators, and eradÂ«
ually and with great secrecy drew a net
work around the plotters. The fact was
known to the police that the conspirators
were in close communication with promi
nent Russian nihilists in the United
States, and through this information the
police were enabled to discover upon
almost undoubted evidence that the con
spiracy had recently developed a scheme
to perpetrate an outrage upon the Czar
upon the occasion of his visit to England.
The prime movers of tne plot were Fe
nians in America, and when they had car
ried their conspiracy as far as they could
in the United States Tynan and the other
principal agents were sent to Europe to
put the designs of the plotters into execu
tion. They left America as secretly as
possible, coming by different routes. Their
arrival was known, however, and their
every movement was dogged by the Scot*
land Yard detectives.
After treating of the arrests of the dyna
miters and the capture by the police of all
of their documents, etc., the communica
tion adds that Bell was designated to go to
Scotland Yard to direct a series of out
rages there, the necessary explosives to ba
sent to him from Belgium as they might
be required. When Bell was taken into
custody he had between Â£300 and Â£400 in
cash upon his person, together with Amer
ican letters of credit
The Central News says that the plot in
which it is charged Tynan, Bell and
Wallace were implicated, was hatched in
the United States, and that it was wide*
spread in its ramifications not only in
England but in various Continental
countries. The conspiracy was started
months ago and although those connected
with it thought they were working wito.
the utmost secrecy so far as the authori*
ties were concerned there were among the
plotters two or three agents of the British
Governmf nt, who kept the London police
advised of every move that was made or
proposed by the conspirators from the
very inception of the plot.
The police here knew even the names ot
the men who were selected by the Ameri
can Revolutionary Society to cause ex
plosions here and on the Continent. It
was well known that ever since the defeat
of the Irish home rule bill the physical
force party had been active in the spread
of its propaganda, and steps were at onca
taken to closely but secretly watcfc
those who it was anticipated would be
likely to enter into a conspiracy against
the Government. Thus the tact of the
conspiracy was learned, the British agents
in the United States completely deluding
the chief-plotters into the belief that they
were bitter enemies of the British Govern
ment and would go to any lengths to
secure the freedom of Ireland. It was
learned that the conspirators were ia
alliance with the Fenians, anarchists and
nihilists, and that they were all working
together. The nihilists, who do not ap
pear to have been specially interested ia
freeing Ireland from the British yoke,
subscriDed funds and dynamite for the
leaders, but only on the express condition
that "business" should be done on the
Continent.
The visit of the Czar and Czarina to the
Queen at Balmoral and their subsequent
journey to France were deemed by the
nihilists to be the most suitable occasion
on which to attempt the lives of their Im
perial Majesties. The donors to the funds
in America, however, insisted that a blow
shoal i first be struck at England. It can
be stated in this connection that Inspector
Melville recently went to Paris, where it is
supposed he conferred with the police as
to the best means of circumventing the
plans of the conspirators. At that time
the English papers were not aware of the
existence of the plan, and in their com
ments on the inspector's journey to Paris
they stated, while pointing out the exist*
ence in London of a large anarchist col
ony, that the Czar would, without doubt,
be tar safer in England without any police
protection than he would be in Paris with
ell the safeguards that might be adopted
by the police of that city. The result of
the knowledge obtained by the police does
not appear to bear out the claims made by
the newspapers.
It is stated that the conspirators before
they left the United States were taught
how to mix chemicals to form high explo
sives and to use clockwork to cause explo
sions. The teacher was a Russian profea*.2
Bor. Through him the nihilists and
Fenians were brought together and it was
due to his efforts that the alliance between
them was entered into. .
The police here in their investigations
early learned that the magazine of the
plotters was located at Berchiem. a suburb
of Antwerp, and when the plans for the j
arrest were complete the authorities of |
that city were notitied and an attempt j
was made to arrest the men in tho hou%Â« t
â where the exolos:ves were stored.
Tui.o, however, failed, but it is thought
certain thin Kearney Â»nd Hams, alias
"Wallace, who were arrested at Rotterdam,
are the Irishmen who lived in ttie house
at Bercheim. Kearney sent Bell to Glas
gow for the purpose of sounding the physi
cal Jorce party there as to their willingness j
to resort to the use of dynamite.
It has been learned that while Tynan |
was in Paris he consorted with notorious j
anarchists and nihilists. He always had
plenty of money, whicn he spent freely
among his associates. He was voted a
'good fellow," but there were those among
his companions who did not approve of
this air of braggadocio and threats of
vengeance against England.
It was thought that he did altogether
too much talking and he was several
times warned that his tongue would get
him in trouble with the police if he did
not put a curb upon it. It is not expected
that the man will be extradited until the
conclusion of the Czar's visit to Franca.
Great praise is awarded to Inspector
Melville for his wort in shadowing and
arresting the conspirators.
It is believed that his work has put a
quietus on a plot that, harl it been suc
cessful, would have been far retching in
its results and which would have made
matters worse foi Ireland, instead of bet
tering her condition. The leading mem
bers of the Nationalist party emphatically
deny any sympathy with the physical
force party, whose ideas they characterize
as chimerical and tending to undo what
ever progress Las been made in the Irish
cause.
SURPRISE IN NEW YORK.
Irish Leaders Do A'ot Credit the Stories
ef the Police.
LONDON, Esq., Sept. 14.â The Central
l>ews has interviewed T. B. Tynan, son of
Patrick Tynan, the alleged dynamiter,
now under arrest at Boulogne-aux-Mer.
Young Tynan, who is an actor, said he
left New "York on July 4. and had not seen
his father since then. He thought, how
ever, that he was still in America. He
knew nothing whatever of the charges
against his father, but believed he was in
nocent of any connection with a dynamite
conspiracy.
NEW YORK, kÂ». V., Sept. 14.-The cable
dispatch published this morning that P.
J. Tynan, the so-called "No. 1" of the
Irish Invincible, whose conspiracy brought
about the Phoenix Park tragedy in
Dublin in 1832, had been arrested
at a hotel in the city of Boulogne,
France, and that three other alleged Irish |
dynamiters had baen arrested at Rotter
dam and Glasgow, caused the biggest kind
of surprise in Irish circles hereto-day. 1
There are few, however, who believe that
the arrests will prove of much conse
quence, as it is the general opinion that
dynamite crusades are things of the past.
The surprise is mainly at the arrest of
Tynan after being at liberty for fourteen
years.
One of the other men arrested, under
the name of Patrick Kearney, is believed
to be John F. Kearney, well known in New
York as a political agitator, and who at
every election starts a paper for political 1
effect. The others are. for the most part,
unknown.
Tynan is now about 63 years of age and !
l.is arrest is liable to bring about many
complications. Tynan has not been seen
in New York for the past seven week.*,
neither has Kearney. It was stated in
Irish circles that both had gone South and
West to stump for McKinley, and the j
statement was accepted as the truth.
. Why Tynan should go to France or to
England on any kind of a mission that re
quires secrecy none of his friends can im- |
agine. His picture had been published
hundreds of times and he has a counte- I
nance that once seen could never be for
gotten.
Kearney was not known to be connected
with any revolutionary movement in this
country.
, William Lyman, the president of the
Irish National Alliance, in an interview
to-day informed a reporter of the United
Associated Presses that the arrest of Ty
nan came to him like a thunder-clap.
"It seems not two weeks," he added,
"since I saw and talked with Tynan in
this city, but it may have been longer. I
cabled to a friend in Paris to see that
Tynan was properly represented and that
his extradition to England was prevented,
if possible. Ido not believe that Tynan
went to Europe on any business connected
with the cause.
- "I believe that he went to Europe to
settle up the estate of a brother who died
recently in South America, and the large
sum of money found on him may have
been a portion of his heritage. The man
Bell, who was arrested in Glasgow, I do
not know, and the suggestion that he was
Tynan's secretary is ridiculous.
"I know J. F. Kearney of New York
well. But I had no idea that he was in
Rotterdam, as I talked with him in this
city but a few days ago. He may have
pone to Europe since, but I do not think
he went on business connected with the
cause. I do not know the man named
Haines, arrested with Kearney. If they
really have Tynan and Kearney in cus
tody nothing will be spared to secure their
release. ,
The members of Tynan's family, with
the exception of one son, who is now In
London, are Jiving on One Hundred and
Fifty-sixth street. His daughter was seen
at their home this morning. She said that
her father, so far as she knew, was in
Rochester.
; Her mother, she said, bad received a let
ter from him posted in Rochester a week
ago. Miss Tynan could not say what she
believed her father was doing in Rochester.
' "We are not at all worried," she said,
"because we do not think father can pos
sibly be the man under arrest in France.
We feel sure that he was in Rochester a
week ago."
- Mrs. Tynan could not be seen. Miss
Tynan said that her mother was not in.
The last that Tynan's neighbors saw of
him was three weeks ago. He bad always
worn a beard, but at that time he had
shaved it off and then disappeared on the
following day.
: Close friends of Tynan and Kearney de
clare to-day that they Knew nothing of a
new dynamite plot. Excuses for the
presence of the men abroad were freely
offered.
EXCITEMENT IN PARIS.
Arrangement* far the Reception of the
Cmar Materially Changed.
PARIS, France, Sept. 14.â There was
considerable excitement on the boulevards
and at the clubs this evening in conse
quence of the arrest of the alleged dyna
miters at Rotterdam, Glasgow and Bou
logne-sur-Mer. The matter was discussed
from all points of view.
The consensus of opinion was that, &[â¢
thongh the conspirators were fortunately
arrested, the time of exposing their plans
was inopportune, as it might result in a
change being made in the arrangements
for the reception of the Czar.
It was planned that his Majesty should
be driven through many of the principal
streets of the city in order to give the pon
ulace a good view of him. It is now
thought in view of the conspiracy that has
Deen unearthed that the route will be
much shortened. This will cause great
disappointment to the Parisians.
The police have been keeping a close
watch on all known anarchists and nihil
ists, and it is generally believed that
many of them will be arrested as a meas
ure of precaution prior to the Czar's
visit.
M. Henri Rochefort, the well-known
[ editor of L'lutransi^eant, says he does
| not believe that the French Government
i will grant the extradition of Tynan.
OXALIC ACID FOR SALTS.
A Careless Druggist Kills a Prominent
German at Brooklyn.
BROOKLYN, N. V., Sept 14.â Jacob
Mebolt, recording secretary of the Schwae
bischen Saengerbund of Brooklyn and
president of the Cannaster Sick Benefit
Society, died yesterday morning of oxalic
acid poisoning- He took fÂ» dose of the
acid, believing it to be Carlsbad salts, and
was dead in about an hour. Coroner Na
son has caused the arrest of Charles F.
Timmerman, a druggist, at whose store the
poison was obtained.
Mcboldt was 43 years old and active in
German affairs. Before he left his home
on Saturday evening to attend a meeting
of the Sick Benefit Society he sent bis
twelve-year-old daughter Annie to Tim
i merman's for five cents' worth of salts.
j Timmerman gave the girl a small pack
i age, whicii she took home. Meboldt about
j 10 o'clock yesterday morning took a dose
jof the supposed salts. In a few minutes
he complained of cramps, got up, stag
gered around and sank to the floor. When
a physician arrived he was unconscious
and died forty minutes later.
The pol!ce were notified and a detective
went to the drugstore. Timmerman told
him that Meboldt's daughter had plainly
asked for oxalic acid, saying that her
mother wanted to polish metal. The sale
had been duly recorded in the druggist's
poison book.
On being questioned young Annie Me
boldt declared that she askea for Carlsbad
salts. She was asked to pronounce the
I words oxalic acid. She was usable to do
so and said she never heard those words
beiore. She repeated her statement to Cor
oner Nason, who then issued a warrant
against the druggist.

At Last the Letter Is Sent
to the Nominee of the
Populists.
TALK OF THE BETRAYAL
Of the Interests of the People
by the Republicans and
Democrats.
SOFT SOAP FOR THE GEORGIAN.
Peasant Woids cf the Chairman of
the Notification Committee to
the Candidate.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 14.âSena
tor Marion C. Butler, chairman of the
Populist National Committee, to-day
mailed the following letter of notification
to Hon. Thomas E. Watson, the uominee
for Vice- President:
Washington, D. C, Sept. 14, 1896.
Hon. Thomas E. WaUon, Thompson, Go.â Dear
Sib: Such is our form of government that the
citizens of the United States must shape its
course for good or evil throueh the agency of
political parties. When there is no political
party that represents the principles of good
government, no party that stauas for right
and the interest of the laborer, wealth-pro
ducer and all who strive to make an honest
living by fair and legitimate means, then it is
impossible for the majority of the voters to ex
press their will at the ballot-box.
When ail the political parties stand for the
selfish interest and personal greed of money
changers, corporations, trusis, monopolies, as
does the Republican party under the leader
ship of John Sherman and the Democratic
party under the leadership of Grover Cleve
land, then the producing masses are victim*
without an alternative. To withhold their
votes will furnish them no relief, while to cast
their votes for either party is to sanction their
own spoliation and to strengthen the power
that oppresses them.
This was the political situation in 1892
when x stern necessity forced organized labor,
tne organized wealth producers, and others
who believe in good govern went and were en
gaged in legitimate business interests, to meet
and form a new political organization known
as the People's party. This new political
party, representing the principles ol true Re
publicanism as taught by Abraham Lincoln
and of true Democracy as taught by Jefferson
and Jackson, as if springing full-grown from
the loins of the people, cast over a million
votes, winning in five States within four
! months from the date of its birth.
The Democratic and Republican parties no
longer represented the principles upon which
| they were founded. They had long since de
serted the principles for which our ancestors
left the Old World and which were made our
inheritance through the blood and sacrifices
of our fathers in the Revolutionary War, and
had embraced the odious and oppressive meth
ods so long practiced under the monarchies
and despotisms of the Old World. The enemies
of good government, the enemies of the peo
ple's prosperity and the enemies of struggling
humanity had dominated and controlled both
of these parties for twenty years. Both of
these parties had long since ceased to regard
the Interest of the masses and became
the agents through which corporations and
trusts exploit the people; both of these parties
have betrayed the people and have legislated
in the interest ot the bankers, speculators,
bondholders ana monopolists, thus enabling
the favored few to absorb the millions of prop
erty earned and created by the toiling masses.
They hare been the agencies for robbing the
millions to make the few millionaires, and,
worse than this, they have placed the welfare
and happiness of the whole Nation in the
hands of and subject to the confederated money
power of the world. The candidates of both of
these pmies for the past twenty years have
been pledged to the gold standard and have
used the power of the Government on the side
of gold. No matter which party the people
voted for their votes were cast for their ene
; imes and to enslave tnemselves. No matter
which party went into power times grew
harder and the wealth of the many was con
centrated into the hands of the few.
Another party, an American party, was
wanted. There was need for such a party to
keep alive the American spirit of 1776, to ad
vocate and enforce the principles of the De
claration of Independence, to advocate the
rights of American labor and American man
hood, to restore prosperity to a suffering
people and to rescue a great and rich Nation
from the quicksands of bankruptcy and ruin. !
Thus the People's party stands for the great
principles of s republican form of govern
ment as represented by the forefathers, and
came into exiitence to restore the Government
to the people.
The People's party was the first political or
ganization in twenty-three years that made an
honest demand tor the free and unrestricted
coinage of silver. Until the present year both
old parties put into their platforms a demand
for the restoration of silver, but coupled with
it quulifying and ambiguous phrases that neg
atived the demand, ami then rallied the voters
of the West and South for silver, and the North
aud Â£ut for the gold standard, on the 6ame
platform.
The People's party was the first political or
ganization that decided against the surrender
of the governmental functions of issuing
paper money to National, State or private
banks. The People's party was the first politi
cal organization to make definite and specific
what it meant by opposition to monopolies in
stead of indulging In glittering generalities
The People's party was the first political party
to nominate candidates for President and
Vice-President that were not goldbujcs and did
not receive goldbug support. It Is the only
party now in existence which, with an undi
vided membership and a solid front, la de
manding legislation for the suppression of
monopolies and for the equal protection
of all citizens against the en
croachment ot individual and corporate
power. So successfully has It exposed the
shortcomings ot the two old parties, so vigor
ously arraigned them for the betrayal of the
people, so vigorously has it taught the princi
ples of true Democracy and true Republican
ism, that one of these old parties has been
forced to retrace its erring steps and cast oft.
for the time being at least, its base and treach
erous leaden. It was the People's party that
brought tae all-important and overshadowing
question of financial reform to the front. It
was the People's party that made it impossible
for the old parties to longer keep in the back
ground the real National issues while they
fought sham bat les over the tariff and other
minor local issues. The People's party is the
real force, the mainspring behind this great
political revolution.
It was the indomitable force that drove the
Democratic party to make its patriotic declara
tion in the Chicago convention and is now the
constant and strengthening force that holds
them up to that declaration. If this patriotic
and elevating influence as an organized force
were removed then inevitably the evil and
blighting influences that have dominated and
corrupted the Democratic party in the past
would creep into its councils and control
it aeain. Besides there is a considerable mi
nority of the Democratic party, who for policy
are supporting the action of the Chicago con
vention, yet who are radically opposed to Mr.
Bryan and the principles which he represents.
These are the natural ailies of the plutocrats
of the Indianapolis convention snd will spare
no efforts to defeat the reforms vrnich the
people and every principle of good govern
ment demand.
Thus the Democratic party, so long de
bauchedâa party beset from without and lrom
within by the gold plutocrats trying to again
control â cannot be relied on to carry out these
reiorms of the People's party and restore pros
perity to the American people.
Tnerefore there was never greater need for
the vigorous growth of our party than now.
Without it the Democratic party, if in power,
could not redeem its pledges. Without It the
next National convention of the Democratic
party would repudiate the platform it haa ho
recently adopted at Chicago, and Mr. Bryan
would stand no more chance of becoming its
nominee than would Thomas Jefferson il he
were again on earth.
In 1892 the Democratic politicians de
nounced the principles ot the People's party.
In 1896 these same men were forced to purge
themselves of their modern false doctrines and
I return to the principles of Jefferson and Jack
son. That party in its National convention
nominated for the Presidency William J.
Bryan, a maa who was ready to renounce the
false gods of a corrupted Democracy as Henry
M. Teiler had renounced the iaise gods of a
corrupted Republicanism.
The People's party, in its second National
convention held a few wefks later, put coun
try above party and rose to a higher plane of
patriotism than has ever been shown Dy any
other party. It recognized in this young pa
triot of the West a man who stands in the
broadest and truest sense for American insti
tution and American principles â a man as
worthy and as true as any one within our own
ranks, and besides one who had already sev
eral millions of votes pledged to nis support,
and who, therefore, we conid be sure of elect
ing in the present contest. Tnus was presented
to us an opportunity to elect a man who would
be the firs', irieud to the people in the White
House in twenty yearsâ such a mau as the
People's party had scarcely hoped to elect be
fore 1900.
It the Democratic party had been true to the
people and ita own platform in its selection of
a candidate for Vice-PresTSent we would not
now have the honor of addressing youâ one of
the worthiest and most beloved sons of the
People's partyâ in this official capacity, for in
that event the People's party would have
nominated the whols L'eirocratic ticket by
even a larger majority than it nominated Mr.
Bryan. But such was not the case. It seems
that the party was not able at one effort to
purge itself of its modern heresies, cast off it 3
plutocratic leaders, and at the same time it
nominated Mr. Bryan gave him a running
mate who had no; earned in the arena of
action, contending against the foes of
the people, the affection, the confidence
and the trust of the masses of our country
as had Mr. Bryan himself. Had it nominated
a man lor the'Vice-Presidency who was known
to all Americans as a chieftain and a leader in
defense of the toilers and producers of the
land, one who by the use 01 voice, pen and
means had endeared himself to the American
people; one with a past not obscured in a
silence suggestive of either ignorance or indif
ference to the struggle of the people with the
money powerâ the occasion of this communica
tion to your worthy self would not bave oc
curred. The People's party, true to its princi
ples and true to its teachings, nominated for
the high office of Vice-Presideut a man
worthy to have headed the ticket, a man who
represents what Mr. Bryan represents, and
therefore, presents to the people to-aay in the
persons oi Bryan and Watson thÂ« best silver
ticket in the field; a ticket that is representa
tive of American ihterests; a ticket that stands
for Just the opposite oi that for which the Re
publican ticket stands.
If the people win this fight for financial re
form, it must be accomplished by the co-oper
ation of the silver forces of all political par
ties. To secure such co-operation of the differ
ent parties it is necessary to have a co-opera
tive ticket. Therefore Bryan and Watson is
not only the best silver ticket, but it is also
the true co-operative ticket
_We have the honor, representing the Second
National Convention of the People's party, to
fortnully notify you of your nomination for
Vice-President of the United States, and hope
you will accept the high trust, and carry our
banner of "Lqual rights to all and special
privileges to none" to victory against the com
bined minions cf special privileges, aggregated
capital and organized greed. We have the
honor to be, yours most respectfully,
Mai;ion Bvtleh.

MADISON, Nebr., Sept. 14.â Senator
William V. Allen, chairman of the Popu
list committee to notify William J. Bryan,
to-night gave out his letter to the nomi
nee. The full text of the letter follows:
Madison. Nebr., Sept. 14, 1896.
To Bon. William J. Bryan, Lincoln, Xebr.â
Dear Sir: At a convention of the People's
party, held at St Louis July 22 to 25 of the
current year, you were unanimously chosen for
President of the United States, to be voted for af
the approaching general election. It was
known at the time that you had boon nomi
nated by the Democratic party at its conven
tion, Held at Chicago a few days before that
time and that you would in all probability
accept the same in a formal manner. Your
nomination by the People's party was not,
therefore, made with any thought that you
were a Populist or that you accepted all the
doctrines declared by the St. Louis platform.
It was due, largely, to the fact that the money
question is the overshadowing political issue
of the age and because you have at all times
been an unswerving, abl -â¢ and fearless advo
cate of the free and unlimited coinage of
silver and gold on terms of equality at the
mints of the United States at the ratio of
16 to 1.
It was thought, also, that the observance of
a patriotic duty required a union of all reform
forces, and the convention took the liberty
without soliciting or consulting you of placing
your name before the people as its standard
bearer. The convention was in doing so
guided by deep solicitude for the common wel
fare and acting on its own motion, prompted
alone by a desire to bring about the best at
tainable results. So much has been said re
specting the rehabilitation of silver by again
placing it In our coinage acts in the position
It occupied when stealthily demonetized by
the act of 1873 that it would be Idle use for us
to discuss the question. You will ob
serve by the closing language of the
St. Louis platform that the convention
recognized the money question as the B real J
issue of the day, and because Populists be
lieve that you are In accord with them on this
question you will receive their ballots in No
vember. It has at no time been expected nor
is it now that yon will abandon your adhesion
to the Chicago platform, nor that you will ac
cept all that Is declared by the People's party
platform, however gratifying the latter would
be to all Populists. It must be understood
that the party does not abate one jot or tittle
of loyalty to its principles. We have declared
ourselves in favor of many Important reforms
and go further than you or your party have
gone. These reforms are in our judgment es
sential to the liberation of the people from
present unjust and iniquitous industrial bond
age.
In accordance with precedent of our party
we take this method of notifying you of your
nomination. We shall not send a committee
according to old party custom. In send
ing this . letter of notification of the
great honor that has so justly been
conferred on you ' by our party it is
needless for us to assure you that you have the
continence and esteem of all. Your splendid
abilities, known integrity, competency and
eminent fitness for the position Justly entitle
you to a rank among the great statesmen of
the Nation. We feel that in the event of your
election, which now seems certain, you
will carry into execution the principles of
monetary reform to the end that the people
shall enjoy better industrial conditions. It is
not anticipated, that this can be done with un
due haste or so suddenly as to wrench or dis
joint the business interests of the country,
but that it will be done gradually and In a
way to infuse confidence and hope of better
i conditions for all. ' ,
The People's party will exact of you no prom
ises farther than those made in your public
utterances and exemplified in a life devoted to
the welfare of the race, nor will it.ask you to
abandon the party of which you are an hon
ored member. In your nomination our party
has risen above mere partisan surroundings,
adopting a high plane of patriotism, believing
that a division 0/ forces would result in the
election of William McKinley, the foremost
advocate of a deeply burdensome and un
natural taxation and the criminal policy of
the single gold standard, resulting ultimately,
if not in some manner checked in the complete
destruction and disintegration of our form of
government. Your â  elevation to the chief
magistracy of the Nation would be regarded
as a vindication ' of the right of the
people to govern, and we entertain no
doubt that you will prove a worthy
successor of the immortal Jefferson and Lin
coln, and that your public life, like theirs,
will illustrate the purity and loftiness of Amer
ican statesmanship. Your extensive and inti
mate knowledge of public affairs and the du
ties the office will Impose, gained In a life that
has been devoted to upholding : the cause of
the people, as well-, as your keen insight into
the condition of our country, in our judgment
highly qualified you to bring about a change
in a way that will work injury to none and
justice to all, thus making our Government, in
fact as it is now in form only, a ' government
"of, by and for the people." We have the
honor to he your most obedient servants,

SOME TAFFY FOR THE TOILERS
Declares That the Gold Standard Has
Never Been Supported by Labor
ing Men.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept. 14. â Mr.
Bryan left St. Louis at 6:30 o'clock this
morning in a special train, accompanied
by Congressman Allen and several mem
bers of the St. Louis local committee.
Although the hour was very early when
Mr. Bryan's train reached Bellville, 111.,
where the first stop was made, more than
1000 people were gathered about a tem
porary platform near the tracks. Mr.
Bryan was presented by Martin W.
Shafer, chairman of the Democratic
County Committee. In the course of his
remarks, Mr. Bryan said :
If the people of the United States deliber
ately throw their Influence upon the side of
the gold standard it simply means that they
raise the value of an ounce of gold throughout
the world. If we succumb to the influences
which are opposed to us, the great money in
fluences, these same influences will be turned
upon weaker nations and nation after nation
will De driven from the use of silver, as every
new nation that joins In the crusade for gold
will make our property cheaper and our
money dearer and give unearned advantage
to the men who own money and change money
and add continuing distress to the people who
toil and produce the wealth of the world.
[Cheers.] We are here in a great laboring
community. 1 call your attention, men
who toll, to the fact that not in a
single instance in the history of re
corded time has the gold standard ever re
ceived the voluntary indorsement of those
who labor. [Cheers.] It has been supported,
it has been defended and it has been propa
gated by tho>e who instead of producing
wealth, live upon the toil of others and by
holding and cornering the money of the world,
charge what they will for it ot those who must
have it to do the business of the world. Take
away the gold standard, the support of the
money-owning classes and money-changing
classes aud it will not stana for a single day in
any nation on earth. [Cheers.] I appeal to
you to do your duty as you see it and let no
threat and persuasion swerve you from mak
ing each vote register a free man's will. [Loud
cheering.]
The arrival of Mr. Bryan at Mascoutah,
111., had been advertised for 7:45, but the
train reached there at 7:20, and Mr. Bryan
made a few remarks to a small crowd of
undemonstrative people. They cneered as
the train drew out. When the Bryan spe
cial train reached Nashville, 111., the
Democratic candidate found several hun
dred people there. They cheered him
when he came on the car platform and
applauded his remarks about the money
question. Ashley, the next stop, had a
large and enthusiastic crowd. Mr. Bryan
again spoke.
Mt. Vernon had sent a committee ahead
to meet Mr. Bryan, and wnen he reached
there at 9:20 the people formed in line and
escorted the candidate to a platform in
front of the State Supreme Court build
ing, 100 yards from the station. It was a
very good-sized crowd, numbering several
thousand people, and they were very en
enthusiastic. A brass band escorted Mr.
Bryan to the stand, and following him
came a number of men bearing campaign
transparencies. Mr. Bryan was introduced
by Judge Sample, State Appellate Judge,
and made a twelve-minute speech. He
said:
I appreciate the fact that this meeting is
presided over by one who until this campaign
has been a Republican [referring to Judge
Sample]. I also appreciate the fact that v hi. o
our opponents may say of me that I am young
and lacking in public experience, they
cannot bring that charge against a member of
the Supreme Court, whose judgment and
heart has led him to espouse the cause of the
people. [Cheers.] A few months ago 1 was in
your midst, then as a private citizen simply
representing a cause which was near to my
heart, and when I told you here that the
brand of mv Democracy was different from the
brand which was being presented by the ad
ministration, your city was advertised by
those who tried to make it appear that I was
not a Democrat. My friends, those of you
who were here know that 1 not only did not
declare myself not a Democrat, but I have al
ways declared myself a better Democrat than
any man who sought to undo what Jefferson
and Jackson did for the American people.
[Great cheering.]
Fifteen hundred peonle were bunched
together around a speaker's platform at
McLeansboro, 111., wnen Candidate Bry
an's train reached that place at 10:20 a. m.
A gangplank, one end resting on the train
platform, enabled Mr. Bryan to reach the
stand without being obliged to fight his
way through the throng, as he had fre
quently been obliged to do. He made a
short speech and said :
Since 1873 the people have been trying to
restore the law which existed before '73.
From the beginning of the Government down
to '78 there never was a day when silver was
discriminated against as a standard.
Referring to the Chicago convention he
said:
i A majority of the delegates in that conven
tion went there instructed to declare for the
free coinage of silver at 16 to 1, and obeyed
their Instructions and adopted a platform that
breathes the spirit of the Declaration of Inde
pendence, which is now offered to the toilers
of this country. [Applause.] The men who
have been trying to read out of the Democratic
party those who stood by its ancient doc
trines were the first to leave the Democratic
party and find a congenial home somewhere
else. We have no desire to drive Democrats
out of the party unless they want to use it for
the purpose unknown to the founders of the
party. But when we had to choose between
the company of those who had been advocat
ing the dominion of syndicates and those who
believed in the principles of our forefathers
and the Interests of the people, we prefer to
lose the company of some of our leaders and
retain the confidence ot the people.
Carmi, 111., turned out a big crowd to see
and hear Mr. Bryan. When his special ar
rived there at 11 o'clock enough people
were gathered at the station to fill an open
space a bnndred feet square, carmi bad a
stand erected for his accommodation. The
regulation brass band was on hand and
ail the appurtenances of a political meet
ing were there. Mr. Bryan said:
Our opponents tell us that if prices fall the
farmer makes as much on what he buys cheap
as he loses on what he sells cheap. They forget
that some things do not fall. Your taxes are
not tailing. I know not how it may be in this
country, but as a rule the taxes of a farmer are
as much to-day as they were twenty years ago
[a voice, "They are a great deal more"]; al
though it takes twice as much of the farmer's
product to pay these taxes as it did then. Now,
all those who find a rising dollar a good thing
are telling us that we must maintain a golu
standard. My friends, let them think so if they
will; let them vote that way if they desire to.
but I want to impress upon your minds that
you who are injured by a gold standard have
got to secure that relief yourselves through
the ballot box if you are going to seek relief.
[Anplause.]
Soon after leaving Carmi the Bryan
special crossed the Wabash into Indiana
and Mr. Bryan received a welcome to that
State from committees from Evansville
and other places. The first place where a
stop was made in Indiana by the Bryan
train was at Mount Verrion at noon. Five
tnousand people greeseil Mr. Bryan there.
Mr. Bryan reached Emnsville shortly
beiore 1 o'clock. He was placed in a car
riage and taken to an open lot, 1 00 yards
from where the train s opped, at the cor
ner of Ohio street and First avenue. The
lot was crowded to its outskirts with peo
ple. Two Bryan and Sewnll clubs arrived
after Mr. Bryan reached the covered stand
from which he made nis speech, and in
creased the gathering. The candidate was
very heartily cheered by an audience of
SOOO people, and when he was presented
by Colonel Shanklin, National committee
man of Indianapolis, the cheering was re
newed.
Mr. Bryan went over many of the points
discussed by him before. He spoke i;i
pan as follows:
As I came down the street here I noticed a
picture showing the mints open in one place
and the lactories in another, and the Republi
can party assures the people it is trying to
open the'faetories while we are trying to open
the mints. Our policy means the opening of
both mints aud laciories. The triumph of the
Republican party means the closing ot both
mints and factories. [Applause.] How can
the manufacturer sell Roods unless the people
are able to buy them? As long as you drive
down the price of farm products you make it
impossible for the farmer to buy the products
of the factories, and until he can buy you can
not open the factories. When they say they
want to open the factories first and then times
will be good it is putting the cart before the
horse. It is like saying a man has a good
wagon and it runs well if ho could only make
the horse go. [Laughter.] People need cloth
ing and other products of the factory. Why
can't they buy them? Because when the
farmer sells his crops in gold prices and pays
his debts and taxes he has nothing leit to
spend at the store. [Applause.]
On the way to the station the spirited
horses attached to Mr. Bryan's carriage
became frightened and jumped into the.
crowd. There was a momentary panic
among those near the carriage and a great
scamp r for safety. One of the horses
plunged back and "forward furiously, get
ting beyond the control of the driver. At
thisjunoture Mr. Bryan and those with
him jumped to the ground juat as the
horses were subdued oy some policemen.
The train left Evansville at 1:25 o'clock
and crossed over the Ohio River into Ken
tucky.
Henderson, Ky.. where the candidate
was scheduled to stop for an hour, was
reached at 2 o'clock. An escort, composed
of the Carlisle Rifles, 500 mounted men
from Union County, city and county
officials in carriages, and others, conveyed
Mr. Bryan to the courthouse, where he
made a speech before a iar^e and en
thusiastic audience. Ex - Congressman
James F. Clay introduced Mr. Bryan, who
was received with wild enthusiasm. He
made a speech half an hour long and then
went over to another stand at the edge of
the park and addressed a second great as
semblage for twenty minutes. Mr. Bryan
repeated his usual talk for silver.
At the conclusion of his remarks the
escort was re-formed and MÂ«\ Bryan re
turned to his train cheered along the way.
The train left Henderson at 3:15. An extra
car furnished to the Kentucky people
accompanying Mr. Bryan by the Louis
ville, Henderson and St. Louis road, over
whose tracks the trip to Louisville was
made, was attached to the special train at
Henderson.
A stop of ten minutes was made at
Owensboro, the home of Urey Wootison,
National committeeman from Kentucky,
whose guest Mr. Bryan will be while
traveling through the State.
At Hawesville, Cloverport and Irvington
Mr. Bryan said a few words to several
hundred people at each place. He also
addressed quite a gatherine at West Point,
where flaming jets of natural gas formed
the principal illumination in his honor.
At Louisville many people turned out
to see Bryan, and he made several speeches
of the usual silvery hue.

CANTON, Ohio, Sept 14.â The visiting
delegations took an early start this week.
Major McKinley commenced his speech
tnaking at 11 o'clock this morning, and he
Will not finish his oratorical labors until
Saturday evening. At 10:30 a delegation
â¢f 1000 wool-growers and business men
from Harrison County, Ohio, arrived in
Canton. This delegation started from
Cadiz, the county seat' and home of the
Venerable diplomat and jurist, John A.
Bingham, shortly after sunrise. As the
majority of the men in the delegation were
farmers early rising was no hardship for
them.
The Harrison County men were re
ceived in a handsome way at the station
by the Canton mounted troop, who es
corted them to Major McKinley's resi
dence. The candidate has made a good
many speeches in Harmon County â which
Is one of the largest wool-growing commu
nities in the West â and he ha* a large
number of acquaintances and admirers
there, many of whom were among the
visitors to-day. Ii was this fact that ac
counted in the measure for the ardor of
the greeting which Major McKinley re
ceived when he appeared on his front
porch this morning. The farmers of Har
rison County cheered long and lustily.
Ex-Attorney-General D. A. Hollings
worth was spokesman. He said in part:
Major McKinley: Your friends, both politi
cal and personal, of Harrison County, 1000 in
number, are here to-day to pay their respects
to you and wish you godspeed in the manly
fight you are making for American honor,
American industries and American homes.
The people of Harrison County, here and at
home, beg to tall your special attention to the
condition of their one leading industry, the
recent prostration, almost destruction, of
which by Democratic free trade lias paralyzed
every business center of the county.
Under the beneficial influences of the
act oi 1807, known as the Bingham
wool tariff, the venerable author of
which is still living in great respect and
honor at Cadiz, and who sends by us to you his
greeting and assurances of support, Harrison
County produced more sheep and wool than
any other county in the United States on like
area. Its soil seems especially adapted to
sheep husbandry. This prosperous condition
Df our wool iudustry was continued uuder the
McKinley tariff of 1890, and it became in fact,
not only tne leading industry, but a part and
parcel, the woof and warp, of every industrial
enterprise in the county.
In 1892, the last year of the McKinly tariff,
the sheep of Harrison County numbered 159,
-246, and were valued for taxation at $400,
870. Siuce then the number of sheep has rap
idly decreased, so that in 1896 the statistics
Ehow only 92,134, valued at $165,512, the
wool clip oi which amounts to oniy 512,265
pounds.
Mr. Hollingsworth's speech was loudly
and enthusiastically applauded. When
the people became quiet Major McKinley
stepped forward. There was a thunder of
applause, and then he commenced his
speech. It was addressed to the wool
growers of the country and of Harrison
County. Major McKinley said :
Mr. Hollingsworth, Ladies and Gentlemen â
My Fellow Citizens: I count it as a very
Bpecial honor to receive this visit from my
fellow citizens, composed for the most part
of the farmers of Harrison County. I would
have been giad to have had with you that
venerable citizen and statesman, Hon. John
A. Bingham [great applause], whose message
of cheer and congratulation and good will
you have brought me. [Renewed applause.]
It 13 especially gratifying to me to receive a
Visit from so many of the farmers ana wool-
Rrowers of Harrison County.' There is scarcely
& county in the State which is so essentially
agricultural as yours. You have no large
towns; you have but few factories and your
occupations are almost exclusively rural,
i'our county has long been noted as one oi the
great agricultural sections of the State, and
especially devoted to that branch of agricul
ture known as sheep-raising and wool-grow
ing. There is probably no portion of the
country of the same area that has supDorted
so many siieep as yours, and for many years
at least this was the most profitable industry
of your farmers. It is not so good, I believe,
now as formerly. [Laughter and applause
Â»ad cries of "No, no!"] The last three years
nave been years of great trtal, not only to the
wool-growers of your county, but to the entire
country. You have seen your crops disappear
ttnd your fleeces diminish in value to au ex
tent that prior to 1892 you would not have be
lieved was possible. 1 remember in 1891 to
bave delivered an address in the city oi Cadiz
to the assembled farmers of Harrison County,
In which I undertook to predict what would
happen if we had free wool in the United
States. There were few men in that great
audience who believed my prediction then.
What do you think of it now, farmers of Har
rison County? [Cries of "We think it all
right."]
â  In 1891 you had, according to your banners
displayed here to-day, 153,503 sheep of an
average value of $5 per heÂ»d. In 1896 you
have but 92,000 sheep worth only $1 50 per
head. In 1891 you received from 30 to 32
cents per pound for your wool; in 1896, lor
the same grade of wool, from 14 to 16 cents
per pound. Thi3 enormous loss to a great in
dustry is truiy astounding and calls for seri
ous consideration and prompt remedy if one
h.u be found, and the only remedy we have in
the United States is by the ballot; andifitis
protection you want you know what party car
ries tue banner of protection. [Enthusiastic
taeer.ng and cnes of "What's the matter with
McKinley? He's all right."]
Prior to the enactment of the Wilson tariff
law you had enjoyed almost without inter
ruption from the beginning of the Government
k tariff on your product to protect you from
the competition of the cheaper lands and the
theaper labor of other countries. By that act
Jour product was made free and opened up to
I he nnrefctricted competition of all the wool oi
Uie wond. What makes that act more inde
fensible iss first, ihdt it was wholly unneces
lury; ami, second, that it was singling out one
Of the greatest industries of the country for
(omediate sacrifice, leaving o her industries
liaviug no greater claim upon the considera
ifun of the Government practically unharmed.
[Cries of "That's right."] No class of our
citizens have suffered so much from
that tariff law as the wool-growers of
tue United States, and none were
more deserving of generous treatment than
they. So Inexcusable was this act that Presi
dent Cleveland, who favored a reduction ill
tariff all along the line, and who believed in
free raw material, wan unwilling to sign the
bill and used ihese characteristic words ngainst
it: ''It may well excite our wonder that
Democrats are willing to depart from this (free
raw-material doctrine), the most Democratic
of all, tariff principle, and that the inconsist
ent absurdity of such a proposed departure
should be emphasized by the suggestion that
the wool of the farmers be put on the free list,
and the protection of tariff taxation be placed
around the iron ore und coal oi corporations
nnd capitalists,." But this did not avert the
fatal blow. Less organized than other indus
tries in the country you were unable to secure
the recognition to which you were justly enti
tled to, and your great product was made the
victim of free trade. [Cries of '-That's right."]
The platform of the National Republican
party, upon which we stand this year, much
to my gratification singles out the wool indus
try and makes of it special mention as entitled
to full protection under our revenue laws.
[Loud app,mi-e and cries of "Good, good!"]
This is the language of the National platform:
"To all our productsâ to those of the mine and
the field, as well as those of the shop and fac
toryâto hemp, to wool, the proauct of "the
great industry of sheep industry, as well as to
the finished woolens of the mill, we promise
the most ample protection." [Great ap
plause.] And what the Republican party
promises it is in the habit of performing.
[Cries of "That's light!"] It does not
make promises to be broken. It says
what it means and means what it says. If
clothed with power in all branches of the
Government it will give to this great indutry
fair and just protection with all other indus
tries oi the country. But, my fellow-citizens,
what we want, whether we produce wool or
any other agricultural product, is to preserve
the splendid home market to our own Amer
ican producers. [Great applause.] It is the
beat market in the world. There is no other
market like it and upon every principle of
justice and lair play it belongs to us. and to
nobody else before us. [Applause and cries of
"That's right."]
Protection to the farmer has been recognized
from the beginning of the Government until
now. As showing the importance of your in
dustry it is only necessary to say that in 189 2
there were 700,000 wool-growers in the United
Statesâ 7oo,ooo people whose chief occupation
was that of wool-growing. There were prob
ably one-fourth as many more who were own
ers of small flocks of sheep in the United
States. This industry employed besides those
â who owned the flocks, it is estimated, at least
500,000 laborers, representing, with those who
were dependent upon them, nearly 2,500,000
people. There were 700,000 larms, averaging
160 acres each, devoted to this industry; and
the mountainous regions and the vast plain
of the great West, which are not adapted to
other kinds of farming, have been utilized In
this great industry and made valuable. Every
one of these farms, comprising 160 acres of
landâ ll2,ooo.ooo acres in allâ has been
seriously injured by placing wool upon the
free list. In one of trie agricultural papers of
the West I have seen the statement that in
Oregon, Utah, Washington, Idaho and Western
Montana there were 6.710,746 sheep, which
were worth in 1892 $13,421,000. and which in
1896 were worth only $6,710,000. In 1892
we had 47,273,553 sheep in the United States,
valued at $125,000,000. In 1895 we had 38,
-298,000, valued at $65,000,000; and the total
imports of woolen goods in 1892, under the
Repub ican protective tariff law, was a little
above $37,000,000, and in 1895. under the
Wilson tariff law, these imports amounted to
more than $60,000,000. [Cries of "Hurrah for
McKinley and the Republican party!"]
On the second day of April, 1888, in pre
senting the minority report in opposition to
the Milb tariff bill in the National House of
Representatives I said: "Wool on the free
list is a deadly assault upon a great agricul
tural interest and will fall with terrible sever
ity upon a million people, their households and
dependencies. It will destroy invested capi
tal, unsettle established values, wrest lrom the
flock-masters their life-time earnings, bank
rupt thousands of our best and most Indus
trious farmers, and drive them into other
branches of agriculture already overcrowded.
[Cries of , "That's what it has donet"] It is a
vicious and indefensible blow at the entire
agricultural interest oÂ£ the country." [Cries
of "You are right."]
Major McKinley quoted Alexander
Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson in effect
that the duties we lay on all articles of
foreign manufacture secures us against a
relapse into foreign dependence. Con
tinuing he said :
My own idea is that we should encourage
jhome manufactures to the extent of our own
consumption. [Applause.] I have said that the
home market is the best market. You know
that from experience; and the home market is
made better by increasing our factories and
giving employment to idle workmen. [Great
cheering.] Put every idle man in the country
to work and your consumers will be Increased
[cheers and cries of "That's right"], and when
your consumers are increased then your mar
ket is improved and the bettor the price you
receive for your products. [Cries of "Good,
good!"]
It was said that if we opened up this coun
try to the free use of the wool oi the world
the farmers would be benefited. It was done,
and with what beuefit you know better than I
can tell you. Now they tell you that free sil
ver [laughter] is the panacea for all your ills.
[Renewed laughter.] And you have the same
money in circulation now that you tiad four
years ago, but you wool-growers have not got
as much of it as you had then. [Cries of
"That's right.] As free wool degrades your
industry so free silver will degrade your
money. [Applause and cries of "That's right,
too."] You have already been fleeced by loss
on your flocks and you don't propose to be
fleeced further by loss on your money. [Cheer
ing.]
My fellow-citizens, I am glad to receive you
and welcome you here at my home, ana it will
afford me sincere pleasure to shake hands with
each one of you personally if you desire me to
do so. [Great applause.]

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1896.
BOURKE COCKRAN
TALKS AT OMAHA
Great Crowds Turn Out to
Hear the New York
Statesman.
FIERCE RIOT AVERTED.
Planks Used as Seats Give Way
and the Audience Grows
Surly.
BRYAN'S FRIENDS MAKE NOISE
Again Those Unanswerable Questions
Are Aluded To by the Noted
Speaker.
OMAHA, Nebb., Sept. 14.â W. Bourke
Cockran spoke at the Collisseum to-night
to a crowd estimated at 12,000 people. Sec
retary of Agriculture Morton presided.
Several thousand more tickets were issued,
and what with beat and the breaking
down of benches and people going out it
was twenty minutes before order could be
had. Several thousand Bryan men, includ
ing several silver clubs en masse, were in
the audience and cheered every reference
made to Mr. Bryan.
Mr. Cockran began by saying that he
was profoundly grateful for this hearing
and that the West would give to a man
from New York â a State which Mr. Bryan
had denominated " the enemy's coun
try" â such an audience. He hoped never
again tv hear a citizen of this land speak
of any part of it as "the enemy's coun
try." He had the highest respect for Mr.
Bryan's character. Personally it was
above reproach. That was, he said, what
made his candidacy on the platform that
was made at Chicago by Populists captur
ing the Democratic convention so danger
ous. If tbe nominee were a dangerous
man on that platform there would be less
to apprehend.
If all Mr. Bryan has said about tbe
crime of 1873 and the dealings with Euro
pean money-changers were true, our Gov
ernment must be a failure. If free coin
age would raise the rate of wages to the
laborer, he himself, not professing over
weening love for the laboring man, bat
simply on the theory that it would benefit
him personally, would indorse free coin
age. He had asked Mr. Bryan upon what
i wages were based, and Mr. Bryan had not
answered him because he could not. To
raise the price of everything would accom
plish nothing and the agitation would be
useless, If Mr. Bryan raised the prices of
commodities above wages it would be
injurious to the laborer, while if wages
were pushed above commodities it would
injure the farmer. No one could pay $2
for a day's labor when he could get it" for
$1 50. Wages are not regulated by phi
lanthropy.
Mr. Cockran said he had been a great
traveler, but he had never seen people so
prosperous or crops so abundant as those
this year in the West, except lhat a cloud,
the agitation of free coinage, had been cast
across the country. But this cloud would
be cleared away in November by the
triumph of National honesty and honor.
The best news he could take back East
would be that he had seen in this city the
largest audience he had ever seen and that
the Bryan campaien had collapsed.
Secretary Morton made a brief speech
on taking the chair, but even the report
ers could not catch his words, and it was
merely pantomime to the audience, which
was struggling for seats and yelling, "Sit
down!" to ttiose who stood in the aisles.
In the attempt to seat so vast an audi
ence planks were used, supported at either
end by a chair. .People crowded upon i
these until the boards broke, and those ;
who were seated had to- stand. Hundreds !
of these boards broKe, and the crowd was !
spotted frequently with small groups of !
standing people who had no place to ait,
who could get neither in nor out.
When the meeting was called to order
these standing groups interfered with the
sight of those silting, and confusion fol-
Jowed. Cries of "Sit down" were continu
ous from those sitting, and were responded i
to with hisses by those standine. The
trouble, if any there was, was In issuing
tickets to more than the seating capacity
of the Collisseum, and then throwing open
of the doors for all others to crowd in. By
the use of other chairs and boxes the
broken planks were again made to do
service, and after the people nad again
been properly seated, there was no further
disturbance, and Mr. Cockran was ac
corded respectful hearing, except that his
reference to Bryan on two or three oc
casions was greeted with rounds of ap
plause by the friends of that gentleman
who were In the audience.
Several avowed Bryan supporters were
giventickets by the committee who had
the meeting in charge, and these men
probably inadvisedly, interrupted the
speaker a few times by prolonged cheers I
for their favorite.
TOM WATSON IN NEBRASKA.
Atks the West and South to Preserve the
â  People's Party.
OSCEOLA, Nebr., Sept. 14.â Thomas F.
Watson spoke to an audience of over 3000
here to-day. The weather up to 10 o'clock
was very disagreeable, it having rained I
throughout the entire night. This kept '
away a great number of people from the I
surrounding country. Mr. Watson , spoke I
for nearly two hours and presented a com- j
plete argument for all of the Populist j
party and principles. His reference to the
fact that of all the Congressmen elected
from the Southern States through the aid
of the Populist party, he was the only one
who had remained true to the faith, pro
duced tremendous cheering.
His criticisms of Sewall, the Democratic
nominee for Vice-President, was couched
in gentlemanly language, and his main I
point was that this was a fight for the '
preservation of the Populist party, and in
order to get the needed" reforms the West
and South must stand shoulder to shoul- <
der, as from those sections must come th 1 ? |
votes necessary for success. Continuing
he said: 1 â¢ . . D
"It 1 believed it best for the Interests of |
Mr. Bryan I would willingly get off the 'â 
ticket. Perish my name forever if I cannot !
be instrumental in freeing this people."
He called attention to the fact that
sound-money Democrats had gone to the
South and selected General BucKner. In
closing he made an appeal to the people
of Nebraska to look well to their interests
on election day.
Congressman Bell addressed a large
audience at a mass-meeting this evening.
Both speakers leave for Wahoo in the
morning, at which place they speak to

PLEAD FOR CLIFTON MA YNE.
Affidavits Filed by the Girls He Wat Con
rictrd of Wronging.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 14.â Clifton
R. Mayne, now in jail under sentence of
twenty-live years for a crime against the
Shipton girls, and retained pending an
appeal to the Supreme Court, has sud
denly sprung into public notice again, be
cause of a motion filed to-day in the Su
perior Court, supported by numerous affi
davits, asking the court to set aside its
former ruling denying to the prisoner a
new trial.
The affidavits are from Delia Shipton, a
sister of Elsie, who charged Mayne with
having wronged her. She now declares
that she had testified falsely in the trial
as to her sister's age. There is an affidavit
from the mother, statine tbat she gave the
child's age incorrectly at the time of the
trial, and that Elsie was really born in
1880, which would place her slightly over
the a^e of consent.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 14.â John
E. Dold of South Riverside was probably
fatally shot by a footpad in Eiysian Park
on the outskirts of this city about 7 o'clock
this evening. Dold was out for a stroll
near the highest point in the park when
he was approached by a medium-sized
man, dressed in dark-blue clothes. The
stranger demanded that Dold should bold
up both bands.
Dold was frightened by the unexpected
order, and instead of complying made a
move as though to draw a revolver, when
be was tired upou by the footpad at close
range. The ball entered the left side of
Dold's abdomen, ranging back toward the
spinal calunin, where it remains. The
footpad made his escape.

NEW WHATCOM FAILURE
Frightened Depositors Cause the
Collapse of the Bennett
National Bank.
Withdraw Their Money Because of the
Agitation in Favor of Free
Co nage.
NEW WHATCOM, Wash., Sept. 14.â
The Bennett National Bank of this city
closed its doors this morning, announcing
that owing to the steady withdrawal by
depositors during the last six weeks it
could not meet the demands made. In
the last month the withdrawals have been
160,000, which is over half of the deposits.
The run has been by people who were
frightened by the silver agitation and pre
ferred to have gold instead of running the
chances of being repaid in 53-cent dollars.
The bank closed last December, but
opened again under most promising cir
cumstances. A statement of assets and
liabilities cannot be secured until the
bank examiner arrives, but Cashier Baldy
states that the assets are in such shape
that they can be realized on quickly. The
total deposits at the last statement were
$106,000, leaving about $50,000 to the credit
of depositors.

AGUA CALIENTE
SACHEM DEAD
Alejandro Barker Passes to
the Happy Hunting-
Grounds.
MOURNED BY HIS TRIBE
Weird Funeral Services Held
on the Great Warner
Ranch.
ONCE PKÂ£VÂ£NTED A MASSACRE
Saved a Party of Whites Frcm
Death at the Risk of His
Own Life.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 14.â Alejandro
Barker, chief of the Aqua Caliente In
dians on the great Warner rancn, died on
Friday, and the Indians have been hold
ing funeral services ever since. They will
elect a chief during the weefc. The funeral
services were weird in the extreme, and
the two or throe hundrea whites en
camped at the Hot Springs were edified
by an example of aboriginal ceremony.
The leading bucks gathered around the
camptire and one by one spoke with great
feeling, referring to the good qualities of
the fallen chief. The women sat at the
fire and kept it replenished and added
their unearthly wailing to the long howls
of the men. The body of the chief was
placed in the center of tne crowd, covered
with a blanket, and candles were burned
at his head and feet. His family was at
tended to by the medicine man during
the funeral.
Alejandro was a good man and a friend
of the whites. He favored schools, and
the Government school on xhe reservation
thrived through his efforts. His own
daughter speaks English as well as Span
ish and writes well. The family lives in a
respectable adobe house. Alejandro leaves
considerable property, consisting of crops,
horses and cattle.
Away back in 1876 there was great
trouble on the Warner ranch because of
the efforts of the owner to ejpet the In
dians, who, he claimed, were squatting on
the land surrounding the Hot Springs.
The ranch includes the Valle de San Jose
and San Jose del Valle, 33,000 acres in all.
The land at the springs is good, and the
Indians, who had considered it theirs
from time immemorial, refused to leave.
The result was a deadlock that was not
broken for a long time.
The owners formally ordered the In
dians off, and they again refused to stir.
Then harsher means were resorted to, and
officers were sent to eject the Indians. The
latter showed an ugly temper, and blood
sh< d was averted only by the withdrawal
of the officers. Meantime the owners went
to law. and when tue Indians saw there
was danger of losing their ancestral homes
they seceretly set tire to the house of the
ranch foreman, and planned to kill him
and all other representatives of the owner,
as well as any officers who came to inves
tigate the affair.
Then Alejandro Baker stepped in and
put a slop to the proceedings. He was
denounced by his tribe and was in danger
of death for some time, but his counsel
finally prevailed and tbe lives of the whites
were spared. Later the Indian* indorsed
his policy.
A case is now pending in court for the
ejection of the Indians from Aqua Caiiente.
It was begun by ex-Governor John G.
Downey, owner of the ranch, and is con
tinued by his heirs. Chief Alejandro,
through his superior intelligence, was a
great stumbling-block to Governor Dow
ney. The shrewd chief won his point as
long as he lived, the Indians being still at
Aqua Caliente, with the indications favor
able to theii staying as long as they want to.
A 'lied by a Mad Bull.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 14.â Jesus Mel

injured so badly that he may also die.
Both men were after the bull and had suc
ceeded in lassoing him, but the riata parted
after the men dismounted from the horses.
They were charged upon and mangled in
sight of tlieir relatives, who were unable
to go to their assistance.
Death of John A. Young.
SAN DIEGO. Cal., Sept. 14.â John N.
Young, one of the best-known residents of

for the following ten years was in the ship
ping business at San Francisco, coming to
San Diego in 1869. He was wealthy and
popular.
GIFT TO GLAS WOOD SCHOOL.
Colonel Stiles Purchases a Flag to Be
Hoi.it f<l by Scholars.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Sept 14.â Colonel
Evan Mile<, commanding the First in
fantry, now in camp at Garfield Park, has
endeared himself to the citizens of Santa
Cruz by his readiness to familiarize the
public with tie duties and responsibilities
of the rank and file of the army. One of
the con mendabie traits in his character
has jus: been found to be his loyalty to
thf> vi'lage school.
While en route to Santa Cruz he pitched
camp one night at Glenwood, fifteen miles
from Here. He learned that the school
house needed a flag and that a subscrip
tion was being taken up for the purchase.
He quietly remembered the fact and
ordered a dag for Miss Josie Coonev, who
presides over the school. She is a daugh
ter of Mrs, J. G. Cooney, grand senior
vice-president of the Catiiolic Ladies' Aid
Society.
On Satur lay next Colonel Miles, with
his regiment, will have a gala day at

the nug and a ball in honor of the gallant
colonel and his staff will end the festivi
ties.

TA COMA'S SENSATIONAL SUIT.
The Late H. Cranston Potter's Widow
Brings Action to Collect His Life
Insurance.
TACOMA, Wash., Sept. 14.â A $15,000
suit is the sequel to the drowning of H.
Cranston Potter of Tacoma at the Cliff
House, Ban Francisco, last February. At
that time the insurance companies hold
ing risks on Potter's life made a thorough
investigation and it was supposed here
that a lawsuit to collect the insurance
might be necessary. The matter quieted
down and it was generally believed that
all policies had been paid until to-day,
when Mrs. Potter started a suit against
the Preferred Accident Insurance Com
pany of New York; for $15,000.
Potter took out a policy in 1894 for
$5000. The complaint does not detail the
nature of the policy, but says the value of
the paid-up policy for which it provided,

TIHBITTS AT SEATTLE.
The Mining Engineer JSn Jioute to Bis
Home From Buluwayo.
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 14.â J. H. Tib
bitts, the South African mining engineer,
whose home is in San Francisco, passed
through Seattle to-night, en route to the
California metropolis. For a year past he
has been in the employ of Clark* Con
solidated Mining Company, iimited, at
Buluwayo, but his contracts were can
celed. Owing to the uprising of the
Matabeles being practically at an end,
Mr. Tibbitts expects a rush of English
and Americans and rapid development,
especially as regards mining, of Matabele-
Jand and Mashonaland, two states consti
tuting what is known as Rhodesia. Col
onel Rhodes he regards as a "good and
great man, whose ultimate aims and pur
poses are to transform Rhodesia into a
lull-fledged republic and not to make the
country a British possession, as has been
charged."
Tibbitts is accompanied by James B.
Hughes and George D. Mtlnford, New
York capitalists, who propose going ex
tensively into placer mining in Sierra
County, Cal., and A. L. Arundell, a Chi
caeo capitalist. The latter will remain for
a few days investigating mining proper
ties in this State.

ARCATA'S SAD
LIST OF DEAD
Another Added to the Roll
of Bridge Disaster
Victims.
FIVE CANNOT RECOVER.
Additional Force of Surgeons
Summoned to Care for
the Injured.
JUEOES PLACING THE BLAME.
Timbers Over the Stream Found to
Have Been Weakâ Story of a
Survivor.
EUREKA, Cal., Sept. 14.â Until day
light this morning surgeons from Eureka
and Arcata worked over the unfortunates
who were injured in the railroad bridge
disaster near Arcata yesterday. A num
ber of wounded were taken to the Arcata
Sanitarium and others are being cared for
at the homes of friends or relative:?. At
10 o'clock last night the corps of physicians
already in attendance was found to be in
adequate to promptly minister to the suf
ferers. Additional aid was procured from
Eureka in Drs. Gross, McKinnon, Felt, j
Sinclair and Wallace.
The number of dead is now five. They j
are: Annie Holland, Ada Kirkham, i
Brakeman Alexander Cameron and the
two children of David Wood. Mrs.
Gregori and child and Engineer George
Burke are not expected to live through !
the night. Many of those who appeared |
slightly hurt last night are to-day con
fined to their beds. New maladies in- |
duoed by internal injuries are developing |
continually. It is believed the list of |
dead will be increased to ten names.
At Korbel, the end of the line, prepara
tions were being made during the night to
run a wrecking train. Bright and early this
morning the wreckers arrived at the
scene of the accident. It was their inten
tion to prepare the track to that the
United States mail could pass. Nothing
was done, however, until the Coroner had
finished the taking of testimony and in
specting tne timbers of the bridge. Over
the perpendicular banks the wreckers
made their way to the bed of the river, on
the blood-stained rocks of which the
debris of the diminished train was heaped.
Nothing remained intact; everything was
-mashed into splinters.
Louis Everding, manager of the lliver
side Mill and Lumber Company, was in
terviewed to-day at the scene of the dis
aster by a Call representative. He was
in the last car which crashed through the
trestle to the rocty river bed, forty feet
below, and came out of the wreck without
a scratch. W hen questioned concerning
his miraculous escape, Mr. Everding said:
"I attribute it to the cigar which I wus
fmoking. It was a long one, and I waited
in the smoker to finish it, intending to
enter the next car and chat with Miss
Holland. We lived at the same station
and were well acquainted. I had just I
risen from the seat when 1 heard a crack
ing noise. Then came a deafening roar,
above which could be beard the shrieking j
of terrified passengers. The cause ol the
appaling din dashed through my mind
in an instant and I waited patiently for
the end. It seemed Jike an age and my
thoughts came thick and fast. To me in
those few seconds it was like being whirled
through miles of space."
When asked his first thought after realiz
ing what happened, Everding answered :
"I remember it distinctly and it was this:
That in case of my death I would leave my
wife and child an insurance policy large
enough to keep them from want." Then
my ideas became mixed.
"When the train started downward," he
resumed, "I was near the car door. Be
fore I knew anything more the safe usea
by Wells. Fargo & Co. had wedged me
into a corner. Then what a noise! We
had reached the rocks. I was hurled out
of the open door and remained uncon
scious for a few peconds. The air was
filled with dust and Hying splinters. The
aust cleared away and I got up. There
were people around me iv all positions,
but no one moved. Then it came to me
that they were not all dead, but merely
stunned. Broken timbers hanging to the
bridge were vigorously swinging to and
fro like pendulums. Every once in a while
one would fall to the earth.
"I called to know if all were dead, and
heard cries for help. Then, with the as
sistance of Fireman Burke, wbom I liber
ated from the wreck, I dia ail that I could
to remove the dead and relieve the suffer
ing. The first body I saw was that
of Misj Annie Holland. Death came to
her instantly, for her neck was broken.
If I had finished my cigar five seconds
sooner I would certainly have been killed
in the same manner."
Mr. Everding believed that the bridge
was safe enough, and that the engine must
have jumped the track, as he had known
four times the weight of the collapsed
train to have passed over the bridge dur
ing the last week.
Every one is loud in praise of Lou Ever
ding's bravery and perfect cooldchs. Be
sides many wounded who were benefited
by his timely aid, two persons were saved
by him from certain death. They are
Mrs. Edward Minor and Henry Burke.
The former was being strangled to death
by a massive cross beam and Burke was
being crushed under the debris.
All of the train employes are either
dead or in the sanitarium at Arcata. Those
who were interviewed were loth to express
their opinion regarding the cause of the
disaster. Engineer Burke, who is ex
pected to die form the effects of scalds re
ceived from the bursting of the boiler, at
tributes the calamity to the weakness of
the cross beams, some of which are much
decayed. The crew which operated the Ill
fated train was not the regular shift, but
belonged to a logging train, the regular
crews being relieved on Sunday.
The revised list of the wounded, as
learned from a visiting physician, is as
follows:
Mrs. Edward Minor, daughter of Thomas
Devlin, fusion candidate for the Assembly,
fracture of the kneejoint and left arm
broken. She is also suffering from scalp
wounds.
The Misses Vintera, nieces of Anton
Korbel, one of the owner* of the road,
badly injured. Annie suffered a broken
leg and Mary is in a critical condition from
a broken rib and internal injuries.
Dan Mahoney of Blue Lake, suffering
from a fractured rib. His young child's
jaw is broken.
George Burke, the engineer, is horribly
burned about the hips and is rapidly sink
ing.
A sad case is that of the family of David
Wood, the bookkeeper, at Glendale. He
has a broken rib and gash on the head
from ear to ear. H;s wile ia suffering from
a broken hip and a fractured pelvis bone.
His youngest child is badly injured about
the head, and Sidney, a bright three-year
old girl, cannot, recover.
An Italian family named Gregori figures
in another sad case. The mother has a
depressed fracture of the cranium, and her
upper left arm is broken. She has been
unconscious since the accident, and little
hopes are entertained for bar recovery.
One child has a broken arm and the baby
is so badly injured that it will die. The
husband is much bruised.
Conductor Harvey Sammonsis afflicted
with a severe contusion of the back. His
chances for recovery are eood.
The others injured are Rosie Budeth, an
American peddler, badly bruised; Herman
Sanders, leg badly cut ; A. Banders, slightJ v
injured; CbarlesÃurke, painfully scalded;
Pven Johnston, severely crushed; Grant
Warren, injured about head. Several more
received slight injuries.
Word was received to-night from Korbel
that Mrs. Cameron, widow of the dead
brakematf, is in a critical condition, in
duced by the shock which news of her
husband's death caused.

THE LETTER NOT A WILL
j Decision Rendered in the Contest for the
Meade Estate.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept. 14.â Dr. Eutha
nasia S. Meade, a practicing physician of
this city, died very suddenly some months
ago . leaving ,an estate valued at over
$20,000.' No will could be found among
: her effects and her only known relative
was a brother, Porter Sherman of Kansas
City, Kans. - Shortly after her death a
mother of the deceased, Mrs. Patience
Sherman of North Michigan, filed a peti
tion for letters of administration on her
daughter's estate. Subsequently a letter
Mrs. Meade had left for W. L. Wood
row, an undertaker, giving directions for
the cremation of her body, was filed for
probate as the last will and testament of
the dececeased by Public Administrator
Secord. â - â â¢. -. . .
In the letter Mrs. Meade stated that the
only one she cared to have advised of her
death was her brother. Porter Sherman of
Kansas City, Kans. The last paragraph
of the letter, and by which it was claimed
the document was her last will, is as fol
lows: "
! My brother, Porter Sherman, will take charge
of mv estate and be the sole administrator
without bonds, to trade, sell or occupy, as may
seem to him fit. *
Judge Reynolds this morning rendered
a decision in the matter, sustaining the
demurrer filed by Mrs. Patience Sherman
to the petition of the Public Administra
tor, and dismissed the petition. The court
held there was no word which could be
applied to make the letter a will such as
the law requires, and being so materially
deficient it could not be recognized as a
will. An appeal will probably be taken to
! the Supreme Court. â¢

; making an address. In reply. Bishop Foss
! said that the reception of lay delegates
into the general conference would greatly
augment the work of the church. This
was applauded.
"I want to say to laymen," said the
I Bishop, "you can never get this reform
with your fists doubled up. We have al
together too many voting in this country
now who cannot read. [Applause.] I
want to see equal Jay and ministerial rep
resentation. [Applause.] You ought to
welcome all pastors wheiher you preferred
them first or not. You must remember |
that ministers surrender their right to
choose appointments and you must sur
render your right to choose, or else the
system cannot survive."
The conference tru?tees appointed are:
Revs. Wesley Dennett. 11. B. Heacock, J.
: D. Hammond, E. R. Dille, F. D. Bovard
i Robert Bentley, T. 1). Hopkins, \V. W.
I Case and W. S. Criuy.
A resolution commending Rev. W. S. !
Goodwin of California-street Methodist
j Church, San Francisco, to the fellowship
I of the Southern California Conference was
, adopted. A collection for Miss Donia
\Y innine for services as conference organ
ist netted $15 20.
Rev. P. F. Jewell presided at the after
noon session, the Bishop aud his cabinet
beine engaged in fixing appointments.
Chaplain Macomber, U. S. A., of Angel \
Island, offered the opening prayer.
The committee on Bible cause recom
mended increased zeal in the circulation
of Bibles and indorsed the American Bible
Society. The committee on Chinese mis
sions reported a year of hard work and !
spiritual progress. Progress was also re- I
ported by tho committee on church exten
sion. Conference and State league con
ventions during the conference year were
recommendea by the committee on Ey>
worth League, which reported that the
young people of the California conference
were, almost without exception, enrolling
themselves under the Epworth League
banner. The new officers of the Confer
ence League are: President, F. D. Bovard;
vice-presidentsâ Napa, L. J. Norton; Sac
ramento, George D. Kellogg; San Fran
cisco, H. E. Snook; Oakland." A. W. Bene
dict; financial secretary, G. W. Beatty.
The committee on evange.ist work re
ported the recommendations that a con
ference evangelist be not appointed, as
there were ministers iv the conference
who could do the work.
The freedmen'a aid and southern edu
cation Committee recommended that a
whole day of the conference ought to be
given to that cause. It reported 9000 stu
dents and expressed a need for more
money to carry on the work. The report
stated that ?42,000 would not be too
much.
Progress was reported in Japanese mis
sion work.
The committee on missionary society
urged more collections and a wider distri
bution of missionary literature.
Rev. E. R. Dille of the committee on
Fred Finch Orphanage reported a pros
perous year; 117 inmates, 500 admissions
of orphans during the five years the or
phanage has been open, the need of a kin
dergarten, accommodations for a total of
140 children, cash on hand September 1
inst. $2908 07, and recommended the sd
pointiuent of an orphanage committee in
each conference charge. Rev. Robert
Bentley, president of the orphanage, ad
dressed the conference and said the or
phanage needed money.
A lively debate followed the report of
the committee on Sabbath observance,
condemning railroad and bicycle riding
on Sunday, the newspapers and every
thing else that was regarded as desecrating
the Sabbath. Rev. Wesley Dennett called
attention to the fact with emphasis that
presiding elders ride on railroad trains on
Sunday, and said the conference would
stultify itself by adopting the report. Dr.
M. D. Buck spoke earnestly against Sun
day travel. This brought Rev. Alfred
Kummer of Oakland to his feet. He said
tuat a portion af the report was "an at
tempt to legislate for toe individual con
science," and he was opposed to that. He
moved to strike out that part of the report
which unqualifiedly condemned Sunday
travel.
Rev. Dr. Dille said that the use of street
cars and other public conveyances on Sun
day was proper; if not, where would Dr.
Case's Howard-street Church and Central
Church be? Rev. Dr. Case arose and said
he would rather that the Howard-street
Church went into the ground and the Cen
tral Church went out and all streetcars bb
abandoned than break down the bunday
laws. The debate ended in the adoption
of the orip'nal report.
The Sunday-school Union committee re
ported an average attendance at Sunday
schools of the United State* during the
year of 1,683,523. Bix hundred and forty
six new schools were organized and thou
sands of converts made during the year.
It recommended that the annual confer
ence give a half day or an evening to con
sideration of Sunday-school work. Metho
dist peoole were also recommended to
patronize the booK concern.
The temperance committee, by Rev. J.
W. Simmons, in it 9 report called all per
sons engaged in liquor traffic criminals.
Dr. J. K. McLean, representing the
Congregational Association, arrived to-day
to prevent the proposition of interdenom
inational comity to the conference. The
committee to whom the matter was re
ferred reported at the evening session
against co-operation on the interdenomi
national plan, on the ground that it was
against the genius and comity of the
Methodist church. A vigorous, broad
gauge speech was delivered by Rev. E. P.
Dennett, who moved that a committee be
appointed to take the matter under delib
erate consideration and report at the next
conference. On motion of Rev. Dr. Fil
ben, the presiding elders were instructed
to oppoint a standing committee of five for
tnis purpose.
Some cogs have slipped in the matter of
appointments. Bishop Foss sent word to
the conference about 5 o'clock this after
noon that he would not announce the ap
pointments to-day. This meant that con
ference would have to adjourn till to-mor
row. An extra day's session is something
that has not been had before in years.
The Ladies' Aid, Mrs. Rev. M. D. Buck
presiding, held a meeting in the forenoon
and decided to ask for a place on next
year's conference programme, and Mrs.
William Abbott and Mrs. C. J. Hardy
were appointed a committee on constitu
tion and by-laws to report at the next an
nual meeting.
Chairman Q. W. Beatty's report of the
committee on statistics shows: Number
on probation, 2300; members in full, 17,000;
total membership, 19,300; number of Sun
day-schools, 264; membership of schools,
24.386; library books, 21,000; paid on build
ing and improvements, f 36,000; paid on
old indebtedness, $15,000; paid in salaries.
$132,500. The membership and Sunday
schools show an increase, but the benevo
lent collections and salaries show a de
crease.

AN ATTORNEY'S DISGRACE
George Hayford Is Held to An
swer for Felony Embsz
zlement.
George Hayford, an attorney, was yes
terday held to answer before the Superior
Court by Judge Conlan on the charge of
felony embezzlement, and his bonds were
fixed at $3000.
Hayford was arrested about two weeks
ago on complaint of Mrs. Susan Cunning
ham, a poor widow, who lives on Bryant
street. He made representations to Judge
Daingerfield, who released him on bis
own recognizance. Since then several
continuances were granted, but the case
came up for examination yesterday.
The evidence for tbe prosecution
showed that Mrs. Cunningham owned a
lot on Gilbert street, which was mort
caged to Michael Curran. The mortgage
became overdue, and Attorneys Curran
and Francoeur were about to institute
foreclosure proceedings, when, through
Attorney Hayford, who had been em
ployed by Mrs. Cunningham, a compro
mise was effected by which she executed
to tbe mortgagor a deed to the property
in consideration of the sum of $125.
Hayford on August 25 received from
Curran and Francoeur the $125 and $10 as
his fee, and euve them a receipt for the
$13"). Mrs. Cunningham made repeated
demands for tbe money, but only received
$3, and finally, she said, Hayford ad
mitted that the balance had passed out of
his hands. He bad deposited the money
to his personal account, ana the bank, he
said, had taken possession of n to satisfy
a note which he had indorsed.
After the evidence for the prosecution
was in Hayford asked for a continuauce
till Thursday to enable him to subpena
his witnesses. The Judge replied that he
had had two weeks already to procure bis
witnesses, and he should have had them
present. He refused to grant a continu
ance.
Hayford offered no defense, and the
Judge in holding him to answer talked to
him plainly but forcibly. He told him
there was no possible excuse for his con
duct, and the Bar Association should take
up his case and purge his name from the
roll of membership, as well as others who
disgraced the profession. He felt sorry
that it should devolve upon him to hold a
member of the bar to answer to a charge
of felony, but he had to do his duty.
Haylord was unable to procure bonds
and was sent to the County Jail.
CARE FOR THE FORESTS.
The Wanton Destruction That
Pro'essor Brewer Has Seen
in Some Places.
Professor William H. Brewer, for whom
Mount Brewer was named, and who ex
plored many of the high mountains of
California while in charge of a division of
the United States Geological Survey in
the early sixties, will leave for his home
at New Haven. Conn., to-day. The dis
tinguished gentleman has for many ye<:rs
been professor of agriculture at Yale. He
feels that he can take no more time to ex
amine into the forests of the West and
Pacific Coast as a member of the United
States forestry Commission.
Yesterday he visited the site of Golden
Gate Park. It was the first time he had
been there in thirty-two years. There was
no park then, only a waste of shifting
sand. It was so unpromising a site and
so remote from the then City that he rec
ommended the university be not estab
lished there. There were no roads then,
no means of communication. The sand
dunes were windswept and desolate be
yond words. All this tne professor told at
the Palace last evening. But when he
went there yesterday be was surprised De
yond measure at the beauty of the place.
"I regard it as one of the most wonder
ful parks in tbe world," he said. "The
variety of the trees and shrubs and the
beauty of its turf was little less than a
revelation. It used to be supposed no
grass could be raised there. When I first
had to do with the park there was a board
fence put around a part of it, and the sand
blew arouna it and covered it from view.
The Golden Gate Par* is a place of exceed
ing interest to me.
"A word about the forests, whose condi
tions the Government has aÂ«ked Professor
Sargent, General AbDott, myself and others
to examine into, and in whose Interests
Professor John Muir has generously vol
unteered to aid us while we are in Cali
fornia. The commission has been oat
since July 1, and has visited the Black
Hills, the forests of Montana, Idaho,
Eastern Washington, the Blue Mountains,
the Cascades in Oregon and Washington,
the Olympics, and finally the Mount
Shasta ana other regions in California.
"I suppose there is no m&n in California
who has personally seen more or as much
of the State as I have. While in charge
of the Geological Survey in the early days
I footed it over the mountains for some
thing near 4000 miles, and also rode on
horseback and inuleback over 10,000 miles
more.
"I want to say a word about Mount
Shasta. When we were there recently,
looking about for several days, we found
the region preatly denuded of its trees
that once added so much to its beauty.
We counted thirty mills about there that
had used this timber. Everywhere great
waste was shown. Lands had been made
worthless for future use, and some of it
had reverted to the Government because
the taxes were unpaid.
"I notice the same thinphas occurred in
other parts of the State. Tne water sup
ply has. because of the ruthless destruc
tion of the trees, been reduced 40 per cent,
while the general damage is much greater.
Lands that was once ferule in tne little
valleys and produced crops are now dry
and deserted.
"And, as in the case of Mount Shasta,
much of the beauty as a resort has been
destroyed. Had the forests been pre
served tourists would go there in large
numbers each year and they would be a
constant source of revenue. Galifornians
should wake up and take care ol their
forests."
AFRO-AMERICAN LEAGUE.
A Rousing Mass-Meeting Held
in the Auditorium Last
Night.
The Political Situation Reviewed by
Speakers of the Colored and
White Races.
The Auditorium was crowded to the
doors last evening, the occasion being a
Republican mass-meeting, held under the
auspices of the Afro-American. Republi
can League. Not only were the colored
citizens and their wives and daughters
there, but hundreds of patriotic Republi
cans of all classes were present. On the
stage were many members of the league.
Miss Minnie bcott, president of the
Women's Afro- American League, and
many of her lady associates were present
as vice-presidents, while interspersed
among them were Mrs. Addie L. Ballon
and other ladies of the Women's State
Republican Club.
T. B. Morton presided, and after extend
ing a hearty welcome said :
As Afro-Americans we have not forgotten
the historical events which carry us back in
grateful remembrance of the heroic deeds of
tne Republican party during the great rebel
lion. From out of the smoke and turmoil of
hundreds of battles there looms up before us
in this ouiet hour of peace that tall form of
one of the world's greatest heroes.
Ills right arm is extended, and with a most
kindly countenance he points to the emanci
pation proclamation, which strikes the calling
letters of slavery from millions of human
beings.
As the vision fades from sight a banner is
unfurled, not of. any strange device, but the
symbol of a Nation's grandeur and glory.
Rev. H. J. Callis was presented and de
livered an interesting address, touching
upon the allegiance the colored race owe
to the Republican party. He spoke of
home industries and the fact that in some
parts of the United States the workshops
are closed to the negro. He said that the
country owes to the negro the chance to
work.
W. E. Henderson was introduced as the
silver-tongued orator of Southern Cali
fornia, and he did justice to the title in
his comparison of tne records of the two
great political parties and a discussion of
the silver question. He was loudly ap
plauded.
The Afro-American League, under tne
direction of Mr. Green, rendered several
pleasing songs.
George A. Knight was loudly applauded
by the audience. Mr. Knight uninten
tionally stepped upon the toes of the offi
cers of the league, so to speak, by declar
ing that he did not like a prefix to the
name American. "There is no Irish-
American, German-American, Franco-
American or Afro-American.
"They are either Americans, pure and
simple, or they are something else." Pres
ident Morton, later in the evening, said
that he would defend the name Afro-
American Leasrue. Mr. Knisht aroused
considerable enthusiasm, Jand in conclu
sion said: "The Republican party has al
ways given you protection, and I ask you
to stand by that party, for when you do
so you are simply helping yourselves."
D. B. O'Brien, the nominee for Congress
from tbe Fourth District, made a rousing
speech, in which he attacked the policy of
James G. Maguire, President Cleveland
and "the boy orator of the Platte."
Thomas Pierson was introduced as one
who was born a slave and had been twice
sold in slavery. Mr. Pierson reviewed tho
political history of the United States and
concluded by making a strong plea for
woman's suffrage.

JOSE DEMOCRACY
Resignation Handed In by
County Committeeman
Caldwell.
NOT A REPITDIATIONIST.
Dissatisfied With the Platform
Adopted at the Chicago
Convention.
BRYAN BTTPPORTERB AT SEA.
Consternation Follows the With
drawal of Two Erstwhile
Leaders.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Sept 14.â Dr. Robert
Caldweil has tendered his resignation as a
member of the Democratic County Cen
tral Committee because of his dissatisfac
tion with the platform adopted by the
Democratic Convention at Chicago. His
resignation was handed to a member of
the committee several days ago, but no
action has yet been taken.
In speaking of his retirement from the
committee Dr. Caldwell said he did not
believe it would be proper for him to re
main on the committee while his views on
the currency question were directly op
posed to those of the Democratic party.
"I consider it preposterous," said he,
"for the American people to claim that
they can maintain the ratio of 16 to 1 be
tween silver and gold, independent of any
other nation. It would be no more absurd
to say that the army &v\ navy of the
United States could whip the combined
armies of the world. If we are to have
commercial relations with foreign coun
tries we must be able to pay for their
products in the coin the seller and not the
buyer elects to receive. The seller fixes
prices and chooses the kind of money he
will take for his goods. If silver is coined
free the gold of this country must, accord
ing to natural laws of finance, go out of
circulation among the people. It will
cause silver money to depreciate in value,
and as a natural result cheapen the pur
chasing power. Tou can call anything a
doliar you please, but no person or Gov
ernment can force a man to take a de
preciated coin in payment for his wares.
"My five years' residence in Japan and
India furnished an object lesson as to the
fallacy of free coinage of silver which I
shall never forget. No gold is in circula
tion in either of those countries, and the
silver is so cumbersome that few people
care co handle it.
"It is generally the man of some means
who can do a credit business, and on this
account 1 think tne free silver idea, if it
should ever go' into effect, will work a
worse injury upon the laboring man than
on the capitalist. True, it will and must
injure both, besides lowering this country
to an equality with Mexico, Japan and
China. A pretty prospect indeed.
"The farmer who has a mortgage on his
place and expects free silver to pay it off
will be the worst fooled man of the lot.
These mortgages are all made payable in
gold, and when the gold has been retired
from circulation by free coinage of silver
he will have to pay a dear price in silver
for the gold coin in which to liquidate his
debt."
Dr. Caldwell has been a life-long Demo
crat, and several years ago was the Demo
cratic candidate for Mayor. His resig
nation, cominer so soon after that of James
T. Rucker, who resigned on 3aturday, has
caused consternation in Democratic circles.
LOS ANGELES REPUBLICANS.
The County Central Committee Organises
for the Campaign.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Bept 14.â The
newly elected County Central Committee
of the Republican party met this forenoon
to organize. Chairman Wood, after a few
remarks calling attention to the fact that
the committee had a hard fight on its
hands, with little capital to work with,
announced that the first order of business
was the selection of a new chairman.
H. Henderson nominated B. W. Lee,
and on motion of Major Bonsall the selec
tion was made unanimous. Mr. Lee re
ceived an ovation as he was escorted to
the chair. He thanked the members for
the honor conferred upon him and urged
that they stand shoulder to shoulder in
the coming right.
There was considerable discussion as to
who should compose the executive com
mittee. A motion finally prevailed that a
committee of five, including the chairman,
should be named, and that it should have
power to name the executive committee,
which shall consist of three members
from each of the five supervisorial dis
tricts. The chair appointed the following:
First District, John McDonald ; Second,
Major W. H. Bonsall. chairman; Third,
W. H. Cook; Fourth, J. B. Neville; Fifth,
A. J. Gwyn.
On motion of Mayor Bonsall the chair
man was empowered to appoint an auxil
iary committee of five of the best men to
be found in the county to act with the ex
ecutive committee.
NEWMAN'S McKINLEY CLUB.
Modesto Republicans Aiaitt in launch
ing the Organization.
NEWMAN, Cal., Sept. 14.â Citizens of
Newman and vicinity met this evening to
organize a McKinley Republican club. E.
S. Wangenhelm was chosen president of
the meeting. The roll was opened and
forty names were signed.
A delegation came over from Modesto to
assist in the organization. The club was
addressed by C. J. Needbam, attorney, of
Modesto. His was an earnest talk, pictur
ing the dire calamity that has overshad
owed the country since Cleveland's first
ejection. ' He saict prosperity would return
to us only with the return of the Republi
can party to power and the establishment
of a hizh protective tariff.
\V. K. McMillan, president of the
Modesto McKinley Republican Club, then
delivered a short address. He was fol
lowed by T. C. Hocking, editor of the
Modesto Herald. The strong point which
he made was that only a high protective I
tariff would afford general prosperity. J.
A. Wagner closed .with a beautiful word
picture of the country under McKinley
and protection. Three cheers were" given
for the grand old party.
LOS ANGELES GUMGINE
J'opocratic fusion Arrangvd by Bottet
of Two Pnrtiet.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Sept. 14.â The
words "People's party should now be ex
punged from the political parlance of Los
Angeles County and those of "boss
fnsion party" substiiuted. It is safe to
say that not one dozen members of the
rank and file of that "party of the peo
ple" really bad anything to do with shap
ing the local policies and plans of the
present campaign. Fusion waa planned
and executed by a half dozen bosses from
the Populists and a similar number from
the Democrats. The conventions of both
parties to-day did nothing bat ratify the
work (done mostly at night) of the steer
ing committees.
After the Democrats had nominated M.
E. C. Munday and George H. Smith on
their portion of the judicial ticket and the
names were sent to the Populists for in
dorsement the Populists nominated A. J.
Utiey and Henry Hazard, the latter as a
silver Republican. When the Democratic
convention reassembles to-morrow the
two PopuliÃt nominees will be indorsed.
After nominating the allotted candi
dates for Superior Judges the Democratic
conventiou took a rece3s until to-morrow
forenoon. The Populists nominated 8. A.
R. Sprague of Antelope Valley for Assem
blyman in the Seventieth District, Frank
A. Cattorn of South Pasadena for the
Seventy-first, W. R. Steele of Compton in
the SevenXy-second and S. A. Waldron in
the Seventy-fifth District.
SANTA CRUZ REPUBLICANS.

SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Sept. 14.â The Re
publican convention of Santa Cruz County
was called to order in the assembly-room

The following were elected delegates to the
Senatorial Convention: San Lorenzo, R.
Thompson; Soquel, W. H. Aiken;Pajaro,
W. R. Radcliff: Branciforte, L. J. Dake;

The platform indorsed the St. Louis
platform, McKinley and Hobart as the
standard-bearers of protection and pros
perity, urged increased efforts for good
roads and highways and favored the State
of California establishing a permanent
encampment for the National Ouard of
this State at Santa Cruz City. The reso
lutions embraced a hearty indorsement of
Hon. James McLachlan for Congress. In
structions were given to the delegates to
the joint Senatorial convention of San
Mateo and Sant& Cruz counties to vote to
secure the Senatorial nomination for D.
H. Trout. The record of Assemblyman
B. A. Osborn was praised.
Included in the resolutions was a para
graph commending Senator Perkins'
sterling integrity and fidelity. G. G. Rad
cliff of Watsonville spoke in support of
this resolution. Judge W. H. Aiken of
fered a vigorous objection to the delegates
being pledged, and brought forward an
amendment to strike out that part of the
report of the committee on resolutions.
After a lengthy debate the amendment
was defeated by a vote of 59>Â£ to 31>Â£. Mr.
Trout was called before tne convention
and stated he would support Perkins.
These nominations for Supervisors were
made: Branciforte, J. S. Collins; San
Loranzo, S. H. Rambo; Soquel, J. D. Esty.
The delegates at large to the Senatorial
Convention are: W- H. Lamb, L. J. Dake,

B. A. Oaborn was nominated for As
semblyman, and as an aftermath of the
fight at the polls between Judge Logan
and District Attorney Lindsay on Satur
day last, in which Lindsay wub defeated,
the District Attorney gracefully placed
the name of his opponent before the con
vention, and Judge Logan received the
nomination for Superior Judge by ac
clamation.
COOMBS NAMED AT NAPA.
The I. jt- Kl in inter to Japan dominated
for Atsemblytnan.
NAPA, Cal.. Sept. 14.â The Napa County
Republican Convention met in the court
house here to-day. F. B. Mackinder of
St. Helena presided.
The platform favors the fullest possible
use of silver as money, but demands a 100
-cent dollar for the payment of the sol
diers' pensions and the laborers of this
country. It approves the course of Sena
tor Perkins, and instructs the nominees
for the Assembly, if elected in November,
to support him. Refunding of the Pacific
roads' debt is opposed.
Hon. Frank L. Coombs was nominated
for Assemblyman by acclamation.
Coombs is a Native Son of the Golden
West, and is one of the officers of the
Grand Parlor. He was born in Napa
County on December 27. 1853. H>? gradu

Washington, D. C, in 1875, and was that
year admitted to practice in the Supreme

Napa County and as a representative in
the Legislature. He proved his ability to
represent not only this State but this Na
tion when he was United States Minister
to Japan. In the coming election Mr.
Coombs will be elected by an overwhelm
ing majority.
Attorney P. 8. King placed Judge E. 8.
Ham before the convention for Superior

SOSOMA COUNTY FUSION.
Democrats and Populistt Combine on a
HEALDSBURG. Cal., Sept. 14.â The

vention. The chair named J. W. Fates,

luma; William Holmes, Knights Valley.
The Populist convention named as a
committee on fusion E. G. Furber, F.
W. Heseker and E. C. Hildreth. These
gentlemen met the Democratic committee
and wire-pulling and hard work was in
order. The Populists were willine to give
up everything for the Assemblymen, but
the head men in the Democratic councils
disliked very much to yield this.
The concession was finally made, and
the two conventions resolved themselves
into one and named A. B. Ware and J. C.
Sirams, both of Santa Rosa, for Superior
Judges. The Populists nominated Allen
R. Gallaway of Healdsburg for Assembly

teenth District. The Democrats nomi
nated W. P. Barnes as Supervisor in the
First District, A. W. Thompson of Sonoma

HARRIS AT ONTARIO.
Democrat* Urged to Vote A gain it the
Boy Orator.
ONTARIO, Cal., Sept. 14.â Hon. Will
A. Harris, the silver-tongued orator of the
Southern California Democracy, addressed
a large gathering at this place Saturday
night, under the auspices of the sound
money Democrats. Mr. Harris is a pol
ished and forceful speaker, and held his
large andience to the closest attention.
"I am a Democrat," said Mr. Harris,
"but I prefer to associate with Bourke
Cockran, Carlisle, Hill or even Cleveland
rather than with Anarchist Altjjeld, Pitch
fork Tillman or Cyclone Davis."
He appealed to the Democracy to stand
for the maintenance of the public honor
ami the credit of the Nation, and not
affiliate with a party composed of repudia
tiomsts, socialists and anarchists.

SHAN SPEAKS AT VALLEJO
Practical Illustration* Clinch Hit Argu
ments for Sound Money.
VALLEJO, Cal., Sept. 14.â Colonel
Henry O. Shaw addressed a large and
enthusiastio audience in Eureka Hall this
evening under the auspices of the Mc-
Kinley and Hobart Club of Vallejo. The
colonel confined himself almost entirely
to the monetary plank, and in the course
of his remarks made many telling points
against the stereotyped arguments for the
unlimited and independent coinage of
silver at a ratio of 16 to 1 by the United
States.
He said that with the destruction of the
parity of the precious metals, which it was
the policy of the Republican party to
maintain, California would share the fate
of Prometheus. She had brought, he said,
many blessings to the Union. The
mythological hero had done the same for
mankind. For his presumption he was
condemned to perpetual imprisonment
and chained to a rock, while a vulture
forever preyed upon his liver, which was
renewed as fast as it was devoured.
If California were to be chained to the
rock of free silver, the vultures would
soon be forthcoming in the shape of trie
specific contract law. California's uold
product was her liver, but the vultures
would not be satisfied with preying on
that alone, but would have to incessantly
attack her other vital organs.
Under the specific contract law the peo
ple of California had incurred obligations
to pay debts in gold amounting in the
aggregate to more than $250,000,000. With
gold at a premium, the people of Califor
nia would suffer.
Colonel Shaw referred to the Federal
disbursements in the State of California,
all payable in gold, and called attention
to the fact that as Solano County had both
the Mare Island Navy-yard and the Beni
cia cavalry post and arsenal within her
boundaries her people would incur a very
serious loss iv a financial sense if these
disbursements were to be made in 50-cent
dollars.
The colonel's illustrations or object les
sons were both interesting and instructive.
Among his exhibits was an umbrella, a
silver $20 piece four inches in diameter, a
Chinese sword made of Mongolian "cash,"
strips of colored paper, charts and many
other things, which served to make very
clear to the very dullest mind many of the
most perplexing questions relating to the
monetary issue.
Seattlr't Silver Rally.
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 14. â About
3000 people attended the meeting of the
free silver forces of this city and county,
held at Armory Hall to-night under the
anspices of the Union Veterans' Club.
United States Senator Squire presided.
Addresses were made by Senator Squire,
Hon. W. C. Jones of SpoKane, Republican
Attorney-General of the State and candi
date for Congress, and Hon. G. W. Thomp
son of Tacoma. Seated on the stage as
vice-presidents were 100 Union veterans.
Ban Diugo Veterans Rally.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Sept. 14.â The Vet

A. C. Shaffer of Los Angeles, P. S. Burk
of Ohio and Judge Luce. The veterans,
200 strone, sent greeting to Comrade Wil

Suffrage Campaign in Tolo.
WOODLAND. Cal., Sept. 14.â Woman

Butte County Convention.
CHICO, Cal., Sept. 14.â The Butte
County Republican Committee has issued
a call for a county convention at Oroville
on Wednesday, September 30. Primaries

CYCLISTS ON THE CHARTER
The Imperial Club Hears Sev
eral Speeches in Its
Favor.
About 300 bicyclists attended last night's
open meeting of the Imperial Cycling
Club to hear a series of addresses on the
new charter. R. L. Radje, president of
the club, occupied the chair.
The opening speech, in defense of the
new charter, was made by M. H. Hecht.
He reviewed some of the salient features
of the document, notably certain provis
ions which he contended would render
more difficult the possibility of official
corruption.
As for the Mayor having the power to
appoint most of the City officials he in
stanced the city of Bt. Pau!, which he
called one of the best governed cities in
the United States, and in which he said
the city officials, or most of them, were
appointed by the Mayor.
Charles Wesley Reed, the next speaker,
contended that the Supervisors were more
interested in the disbursement of pub
lic moneys than in the making
of good City ordinances. He referred in
caustic terms to the fact that a majority
of the present Board of Supervisors is now
under indictment by the Grand Jury for
corrupt behavior in office. He also
noted the disgraceful condition of the
City's streets and sewers. Under the new
charter he contended things would be dif
ferent.
The opponents of the new charier were,
be said, for the most part office-seekers,
whose interest in politics would cease as
soon as their chances for corraling good
salaries might be taken away.
He deplored the school clause in the pro
posed charter. If a California boy could
be taught in the public schools by a grad
uate of Harvard, he said that boy should
have this advantage.
To have the public schoolteachers of
this State limited to graduates of Califor
nia schools would, he thought, result in
California becoming provincial in the mat
ter of public education. In concluding toe
made an eloquant plea for the new char
ter and adjured his hearers to vote for it.
James D. Phelan made an eloquent plea
for the new charter on the ground that it
would provide better streets for bicyclists.
He also applauded the document for its
provision that the civil service rules are to
be applied to employes of the City govern
ment.
As for the autocracy of the Mayor under
the new charter, he said the Mayor would
be the people's autocrat, and for two years
only, entering and leaving ofiice at the
bidding of the people. The school clause
could, he contended, be satisfactorily ex
plained away to the entire content of ail
parties interested.
J. Richard Freud, the next speaker, said
the same arguments could be advanced
against the Federal and State constitu
tions as have been alleged against the
new charter. No public instrument could
be expected to be absolutely perfect,
since there were fifteen amendments to
the United States constitution and no
less than twenty-two of theeichteen-yenr
old State constitution, not countin<l the
extra six which are to be voted upon at
the coming elections. It would be an im
provement in municipal government, and
he asked the votes of his hearers for it.
A few well chosen words of thanks and
good-night greeting from Mr. Radke
brought the meeting to a close.

Awards.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept. 14.âUn
doubtedly the most interest attached to
the match race at the track to-day for $500
a side between Charivari, owned by
Charles A. Hug, and .fitzsimmona, the
property of W. R. Fuller. Both are well
known young business men of San Fran
cisco, and the friends of each were out in
large numbers with their "rooting"
clothes on. The conditions of the match
called for owners to drive. The event was
placed last on the card. Betting in the
auction pools favored Fitzsimmons, at
odds of 10 to 7, and a large amount of coin
was wagered on the result.
As Mr. Hug, attired in an old-cold
jacket and cap, appeared on the track be
hind his pretty mare he received a round
of applause, and Mr. Fuller, with the
cardinal colors ot La Siestu ranch on, re
ceived an equally hearty welcome. Each
of the gentlemen drivers held the ribbons
like veterans of the circuit, and showeii
himself to be pretty well up in the tactics
of scoring, Starter McNair admonishing
each in turn that he would fine him a
bottle of wine unless they came to the
wire on equal terms. Backed from twos
off the boards, Charivari led throughout
in the first heat, winning easily in 2:28.
The books held Charivari a 1 to 5 chance
for the second beat, with as good as 4 to 1
against "Fitz." The latter horse seemed
much more snappy and full of ginger in
this heat, but broke on two or three oc
casions, and through the excellent pilot
ing of her driver Charivari took the heat
by a head in 2:2l}^.
The horse showed such improved speed
in this heat that he was installed favorite
at 9 to 10, with evens offered aeainst the
mare. "Fitz" steadied down to business
and heat the mare rather handily by a
length in 2 :21%. Now a 1 to 3 shot, Fitz
simmons took the fourth heat in a drive
by half a length in 2:23, after going into
the air a couple of times. The crowd said :
"It's all off with the mare," and many
left for town.
Owner Hug wan still full of confidence
and came out for the deciding heat with
blood in his eye. Fizsimmons broke at
the first turn and the mare secured an ad
vantage that he could not overcome, he
finishing about four lengths in the rear at
the finish. Mr. Fuller protested the heat
on the ground that Mr. Hue changed his
position in the stretch, but after some
discussion the judges decided to disallow
the claim. Mr. Hug displayed s-upenor
generalsnip in the bike and was the re
cipient of an ovation at the conclusion of
the race.
This is the final week of the fair, and re
newed interest in the sport is belns; awak
ened, the attendance to-day being very
large and the betting good. Lottie Lilac,
skillfully driven by the Fresno reinsman,
C. E. Clark, took the .opening event, a
$2000 stake for two-year-olds, of which the
winner received $1500, and the rece: t
Montana find, Bill Frasier, scooped in the
2:20 pace, starting a pronounced favorite.
The larger end of the 2:30 trot decided
under the heat dash system went to
Ellert, who took two heats, . the 1 to 8
favorite, Laurel, again oeinp on her had
behavior and being distanced.

The thoroughbred stock first on the cat
alogue for inspection for awards was
shown in tbo ring at the fair grounds this
forenoon. The judges were Judge Post
B. F. Fly Jr. and W. F. Smith. In the
stallion class, Artillery took first prize,
with second and third prizes going to
Take Notice and Gilead, resptctiveiy.
The other stallions shown were True
Britain and Ike L. The decision of the
judges was protested by R. D. Ledpett,
owner of True Briton, on the ground that
both Gilead ana Take Notice were un
sound, which according to the rules of the
society should prevent them from taking
a premium. Take Notice is said to have a
large ringbone adorning one of his legs,
and if this is the case, the judges were
grievously at fault. Why this horse
should be placed ahead of a stallion like
True Britain, the sire among others of
those two prand performers, Rey del
Bandidos and Her Majesty, the latter now
dead, caused wonderment and surprise
among nil horsemen. The black horse
was a model of beauty, sliowing neither
spot nor blemisli on his legs.
Yankee Doodle took first prize in the
three-year-old stallion class and Peru
second. This decision caused another big
howl, Owner W. M. Murry claiming the
judges were prejudiced. There was evi
ucntly some grouuds for this "kick" also,
as Rey del Bandidos. which was entered,
was a much better horse, both as an indi
vidual and a racer, than either. The
balance of the stock shown was a very
ordinary lot and little interest was ex
hibited in the result.
On Thursday next Tommy Keating will
leave with the crack three-year-old Ga
zelle (2:11)4), lor Lexington, Ky., the
daughter of Gossiper being one of the
entries for the $5000 Transylvania stake to
be decided on October 8.
Aggressive Popuiiain.
The book market is flooded with free-sil
ver literature, most of which is of a trashy
and fallacious character. The most plausi
ble and readable of all the productions is
T. Carl Spelling's "Won On a Silver basis"
in form of a story. Tne writer assails the
money power with epigram and epithet
in true populistic style. He is a well
known piacticing attorney of this City,
who, between 1892 and 1894. became the
author of several law books now in use by
the legal profession.

WANT TO FIGHT HERE,
The National Club Will Stand
by Its Agreement With
the Pugs.
Groom Says That He Wants to See
His Way Clear Before H> Makes
a Start.
Fitz-immons, Corbett, Sharkey etal. are
determined that the political excitement
of the present time shall not drown the
interest in pugilism, that is if they can
help it.
Everybody who has a love for the sport
of fisticuffs is aware by this time that Cor
bett and Fitzsimmons have, so to speak,
retired Sharkey to the background and if
the Cornishman can possibly break up the
contract which Sharkey and Corbett
signed in this City, he will be a decidedly
happy man, because in his heart he is
more sanguine of whipping James owing
to the latter's physical condition, which is
generally believed to be^fery much im
paired.
Sharkey is determined, however, to hold
Corbett to his contract, and if the cham
pion faila to meet him withiu the time'
specified in the articled of agreement the
sailor pugilist will claim the alleged $5000
which was deposited in this Cily as a
guarantee of good faith.
Cort>ett is seemingly anxious to decide
the mooted question of supremacy wim
Sharkey, and he has written and tele
graphed Managers Groom and Qibbsof the
National Club to that effect.
It will be remembered that when the
match was made the National Club offered
the pugilists a purse of $20,000 if the con
test was decided under its auspices at
some place which tne club would select
when the proper time arrived.
Both Corbett and Sharkey; seemed
pleased with the offer, but they failed to
give the club a decisive answer, and there 1
the matter remained until very recently, j
when Corbett, after having signed an 1
agreement to fight Fitzsimmons, tele
graphed the club to know whether its offer
still remained good.
Managers Groom and Gibbs very wisely
concluded that the signing of articles be
tween the big guns in pugilism, viz.:
Bob F. and James C, took a Targe chunk
of interest from the match arranged be
tween (jL'iit)sman James and Sailor Tom.
In speaking of the matter as it now
stands. Gibbs said that if Corbett and
Sharkey were satisfied to accept a purse of
$10,000 for ten rounds, the club would
hang up that amount and the contest
could be decided in this City, but if they
insisted on twenty rounds or more, the
club would give a purse ot $20,000, pro
vided the fighters deposited $5000 each as
a guarantee.
Messrs. Gibbs and Groom are very san- 1
guine that a finish fight could not be car
ried off in this City or County, and to save
themselves from any possibility of losing
on the speculation they rightfully ask the
pugilists to prove their sincerity in the
matter by depositing the amount stated
"in some bank.
As Groom said : "If the National Club
should go to the expense of several thou
sand doliars in arranging for a finish con
test outside of this State, and at tne last
moment the pugilists failed to put in an
appearance, where would the National
Club get off? Now we are accused of craw
fishing or backing down, or whatever you
may wish to call it. but any sensible man
can see at a glance that the National Club,
or any other club, for that matter, would
be acting the part of an idiot to incur a
great expense in arranging details for a big
match unless it had a good, substantial
guarantee that the 'talking horses' really
meant Ousiness and would toe tiie scratch
when the time arrived for a fistic argu
ment
"The National Club is in the swim good
and hard and will carry out its agreement
to the letter as it has always done, bat we
do not propose, in the language of the
butcher, to 'buy a pig in a poke.'
"Of course, owing to the political excite
ment which is now on, we do not intend
to bother with fisticuffs until after elec
tion, when we wili appear again brighter
than ever."

ELECTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Read the news from Maine.
Here we have another moral effect
Vermont said it and Maine swears by it.
Tom Reed has a right to say, "I told
you bo."
Sewall might as well stay in his Bath;
he needs it.
Confidence increases and everybody is
getting surer that his neighbor will vote
right.
There is no need of straws in this cam
paign. Every one can feel how the wind
blows.
The Republicans of Maine have spoken
in a loud voice, Those who don't hear it
are deaf.
There is a growing probability that the
Turkish crisis is about to be active as well
as critical this time.
Every man engaged in industry has an
interest in having it protected from the
competition of cheap labor.
San Francisco Democracy may talk in a
different voice, but it is ciearly doing its
work with the hand of Buckley.
It is hard for the Democratic orator to
keep his mouth shut during a campaign,
but a good many of them are doing it this
time.
As Bryan had nothing to say about the
vote in Vermont it would be useless to
ask what he thinks of the news from
Maine.
Palmer and BucKner have no boom, but
they have the satisfaction of knowing
what support they have is solid all the
way througn.
For fuss and feathers, muss and muddle,
no convention of the year is likely to equal
that wuich the New York Democrats will
hold this week.
The fusionists pretend they are working
to carry California for Bryan, but their
p'.ans seem to be laid mainly to elect
Cator to the United States Senate.
It is evident from the brevity of his tele
gram to the Palmer and Buckner notifica
tion meeting that Cleveland has about lost
his wind. He must be very nearly knocked
out.
Bryan has never had any sympathy
with the sheep industry of this country,
but before he gets through with the cam
paign he will begin to feel sheepish him
self.
A war in Europe would help on the
cause of international bimetallism, for
there is no nation over there except Eng
land that could fight a war for any length
of time on the gold standard.
Now that thousands of Chicago Demo
crats have macie a visit to McKinley to
pledge him their votes it begins to look as
if the thing might be yet made unanimous
before the election takes dace.
A comparison of the Democratic vote for
Bryan with that for Palmer will show how
many Democrats would rather follow
their party when it takes to the woods
than to stay in the main road and stand
by their principles.
After reading the speeches of Palmer
and Buckner many a stalwart Democrat
regretted he haÂ«i ever shouted for Bryan
and began to figure out bow he could get
back to the old Democratic road and
march with the old-time boys.
Cator is willing to trade everything for
legislators who will vote for him for
United States Senator, and as a result
Populists who wish other offices and
Democrats who wish to go to the Legisla
ture are wondering whether fusion is
worth the trouble it takes to make it.
The voters of legislative districts should
bear in mind that a United States Senator
is to be elected by California this winter,
and it is important, therefore, that Re
publicans should be chosen in order that
we may have a Senator who wiil work
with zenl for protection to the industries
of the Stale.
In an- article published yesterday re
viewing the political situation in this
State the Exa miner said : "The Call has
â  dagger up its sleeve and stabs the Chron
icle on every possible occasion." That
statement is a bad example of the cam
paign roorback. The Call has never
stabbed the Chronicle nor any other de
fender of the Republican party; on the
contrary it has been always a stanch de
fender of Republican harmony and unity.
Moreover The Call has no dagger up its
sleeve nor any other concealed weapon.
It is an open fighter.
TO HAY AND GRAIN GROWERS
OF CALIFORNIA.
The argument in support of the protec
tive system that has most weight with the
men of any industry is that which is drawn
from their experience in the conduct ot
their business. You who are engaged in
growing hay and grain in California know
how much you have profited by the devel
opment at your farm gates of a market for
your produce. Yon know also tfrat this
home market has been the creature of the
protective system. You know that it has
flourished with protection and that it
broke down the moment protection was
rrithdrawn.
Not long ago nearly all the farmers of
the State were engaged in the production
of hay and grain. The product was far
larger than the State could consume and
a distant and foreign market bad to be
sought for it. In those days the farmer
had to sell all of his product to a middle
man, who sought a purchaser for it
wherever in the world he could find one.
That state of things was broken jip by a
system of protection which build up a
diversified rural industry in California.
Protection enaDled a large proportion of
California farmers to engage in fruit
growing, wine-making and raisin-growiag.
This withdrew a large number of men
from competition in the hay and grain in
dustry and at the same time made a mar
ket for those products. You have felt the
benefits of this change under protection,
and you have also felt the injury that has
resulted from the Democratic attempt at
free trade.
Those of yon who have reasoned out the
full effects of protection on your industry
are aware that it has done more than
make a home market for your products.
It has made a home market for your labor.
In the spring before the time has come to
harvest yonr hay and erain, you have
employment for yourselves and your
teams in doing the plowing and cultivat
ing of the orchards. When the hay and
grain harvest is over you have further
employment in the fruit harvest. Neither
you, your children nor your teams are
idle at any season of the year under this
diversified system of rural industry. Pro
tection, therefore, has benefited you in a
double way. It has given you at your
farm ga:es a neighbor who is not only a
purchaser of your hay and grain but an
employer of your labor.
The disastrous experience of the raisin
and fruit growers oi the State since the
Democratic party began its attempts at
legislation in the direction of free trade
shows clearly that these industries can
not flourish without adequate protection.
You are aware that when hard times came
upon them they at once became less valu
able purchasers of your products and em
ployers of your labor. You have learned
from this experience that your interests
as hay and grain growers are irreparably
bound up with those of your neighbors
who are producers of fruit, raisins and
wine. The protection of one is the pro
tection of all. There is no division of in
terests among t!.e farmers of California.
There ought, therefore, to be no division
of politics on the subject of protection.
Let us unite as a people this year and put
an end to the free-trade heresy in Califor
nia for the rest of this generation. This
ought to be accounted your duty to your
State. Help your neiehbors and you will
be helping those who help you.
The tendency of the times the world over is
for shorter hours for labor. Shorter hotirs in
the interest of health; shorter hours in the in
terest of humanity ; shorter hours in the in
terest of the home and family. And the
United States can do no better service to labor
and to its own citizens than to set the example
to the States, to corporations and to individ
ual-s employing men by declaring that, so far
as the Government is concerned, eight hours
shall constitute a day's work and be all that
is required of its laboring force. â McKinley.
HOIST BY ITS OWN PETARD.
Senator Cockrell of Missouri was se
lected by the Bryanites of the Southwest
to deliver a speech devoted entirely to the
money question. U was mpposed that
the Senator would be able to so present the
question that the Republican party in that
region of the country more especially
would surrender. It was also the purpose
of the Bryanites to use Senator Cockrell's
speech in all parts of the country for
"educational purposes." The Senator de
livered himself of the bargained-for speech
last week at Nevada, Mo., and the work of
scattering it over the land is now well
under way. The Senator himself con
denses the loeic ot his two hours' speech
into this proposition:
"Aristotle said 2000 years ago: 'Money
exists not by nature, but by law,' Money
is created or authorized by law, which
fixes the legal tender, the debt-paying
power of gold and silver coins and their
relative values. The laws of nations
authorizing the fiee and unlimited coin
age of both metals into lull legal tender
money at a fixed ratio create an unlimited
demand and maintain their commercial
value at or about their fixed relative coin
age values."
Aristotle made no new discovery when
he found that money exists by law and
not by nature. He stated that which has
always been and always will be a fact, but
Aristotle did not say, nor has a sensible
man ever said, the thing of which money
(gold and silver, one oi both) is made exists
by law and not by nature. There is a wide
difference with a broad distinction here.
Nor did Aristotle or any other sensible
man ever say that law fixed the relative
values of the metals it makes money of,
Senator Cockrell to the contrary notwith
standing.
But the most rickety and untenable of
the Senator's propositions is that by au
thorizing the unlimited coinage of both
metals at a fixed ratio their commercial
value would be about their coinage value.
A flat contradiction of the Senator's asser
tion will be found in every change in the
ratio of the coinage value of the metals
which the nations have made in the past.
It is always the commercial value that
lixes the ratio, and the law in confirming
the ratio makes the metahs legal tender
money. Ail history proves that when the
law does not confirm the relative value of
the metals as fixed by commerce com
merce immediately withdraws and hides
away the metal that the laÂ«v manes the
dearer. Commerce rejects the idea of a
double standard of money at an unalter
able ratio.
Between 1805 and 1873 commerce practi
cally withdrew the silver dollar from our
monetary system because the ratio did not
do its commercial value juÂ»tice. In 1873
the silver dollar was worth 104 cents as a
commercial commodity and commerce
would not permit it to be used as money
for only 100 cents. In 1896 a sliver dollar
is worth as a commercial commodity 53
cents abd commerce will not permit It to
be used as money for 100 centsâ without
the consent of commerce everywhere.
If it were true, as Senator Cockrell says,
the debt-paying and purchasing power of
money is given to it by law there would
be no sense in having any ratio of differ
ence in the weight of coins. It would be
just as easy {or the law to declare that
25.8 grains of standard silver are the equiv
THE SAN FRANCISCO ' CAL.L, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1896.
alent of 25.8 grains of standard gold as to
declare that 41234 grains of standard silver
are the equivalent of 25.8 grains of stan
dard gold, but it can do neither. More
over, there is not a civilized country in
the world that makes coin as coin re
demption money. It is the quantity and
quality of the metal in the coin that
gives it debt-paying and purchasing
power. But this Senator Cockrell prac
tically admits when he speaks of the
coinage of gold and silver at their rela
tive value, ior it is commerce and com
merce alone that fixes their relative value,
and whatever their relative value is is also
their coin value and hence their purchas
ing power.
It is to be hoped that Senator Cockrell's
speech will have wide circulation, for no
better argument against practical Bryan
ism could be submitted to the people.
Bryanism is hoist by its own petard.
To me the question of free trade is the ques
tion of humanity, the voice of labor pleading
for its own, and the question of free silver is
a question of public morality, honor and good
faith, and its success! would be a blot on our
hitherto spotless National credit. But will it
prevail? No. I answer forever : No. The Amer
ican people of the Nation, like those of Ver
mont, are entirely above so unworthy an impu
tation. â McKinley.
DIGGING UP RECORDS.
It was hoped that the Presidential cam
paign would be conducted upon lines that
would discourage the digging into the
conduct of candidates in the past, and no
doubt it would have been done had work
ingmen been made of material less curi
ous and inquisitive. The fact is, the work
ingmen of this country are not quite them
selves these days, and they have got it
into their heads that the repeal of the Mc-
Kinley act is what hurt them, and that
Bryan bad a good deal to do with its re
peal, wnich is the fact, but just how close to
the wall workingmen should push him on
that account is the question.
Workingmen should see that it is very
painful to Mr. Bryan to have reference
made to his speeches in Congress on the
question of giving them protection aeainst
low wage schedules of other countries,
and they do see it; but somehow they
will persist in demanding to know if he
still thinks that an American wagemac
has no rights that foreign pauper labor
should be obliged by this Government to
respect. It may be that Mr. Bryan things
such questions impertinent and impudent,
and that he will ignore the questioners
and their questions, but Mr. Bryan should
be patient with them. Most of them have
not had a great deal to eat for two years or
so, and not a few of them fear they will
lose their little homes if they do not get
emp'oyment very soon.
Mr. Bryan may not know and be may
not care to know the condition of Ameri
can wage-earners, but they know, and
that is why they are putting questions to
him concerning what the future will have
in store for them if he is elected. They
ere very restless tinder enforced idleness,
and Mr. Bryan ought to be more consid
erate ot their feelings than to tell them
that it is not necessary to discuss such
matters when they importune him for in
formation upon a matter of such vital im
portance to them as opportunity to earn
wages is.
Workingmen know Mr. Bryan held
while in Coneress that protection to
American labor against destructive for
eign competition could not be justified,
but now that he is trareling about the
country soliciting their votes they feel that
he should reopen that question and tell
them frankly whether or not he would, if
elected, use his influence to have the Wil
son law repealed and something equally
as good as the McKinley act put tn its
place. The workingmen of the United
States fared so well under the McKinley
act and have fared so badly since it was
repealed that Mr. Bryan should not think
them impudent when they ask him to de
fine his position â to tell them what they
may expect if he is elected.
Workingmen do not like to rattle the
skeletons in Mr. Bryan's political closet,
but if they stumble over them and make
a noise in their haste to ascertain how
much friendship he has for them they
should not be blamed too much. True,
Mr. Bryan has told them that it is not
necessary to discuss their chances for
work; besides, he has other fish to fry,
and if workingmen have lived through
hunger and disappointment foi more than
two years they can stand it until he has
arranged matters that are of more conse
quence to Mr. Bryan than employment to
iule labor, but workingmen thins other
wise. It is net of much consequence,
however, whether Mr. Bryan answers the
wage-earners or not. Practically, all of
them are now under the McKinley ban
ner and they know that victory for it
means plenty of work and good wages for
them. No, it is not necessary for Mr.
Bryan to discuss the tariff question. It
is too late.
Lack of confidence has destroyed the pur
chasing power of the country; the destruction
of its purchasing power has ruined its mar
ket; the ruin of its market has left the farm
er's product unsalable on his hands. What the
farmer wants is not more coinage, but more
customers; vhit the wage-earner wants is to
exchange his labor for the best dollar in the
world, and the opportunity to get that dollar
with hit labor. â Chauncey Depew.
DO WN IN MAINE.
A Republican majority was expected in
Maine, but the Democracy hoped that
Sewall would have enough influence as
the Vice-Presidential candidate to lower
the record as against the race of two years
ago. It seems, however, that State prid-Â»
wa3 shelved, and the vote cast on prin
ciple, which gives a Republican majority
that correctly measures Bryan and Bewall'a
political standing in that State. No one
believed Sewall when he said, immediately
after being nominated, that his Slate would
swing over to the support of the Chicago
ticket, but the belief prevailed in Bryan
circles that there would be enough of a
Democratic gain in the September contest
to exert a moral influence all over tho
country which would strengthen the party
very materially in November. The people
of Maine had not been consulted, it would
appear, when these prognostications wore
made; moreover the returns indicate
numerous accessions to the Republican
ranks from tii? Democratic party.

of oar institutions to compare majorities
for the Democracy in Arkansas with ma

Arkansas the election returns express the
will of the bosses, and in Maine they ex
press the will of all the people.
Satisfying as the large gains in Maine are
the danger that they may cause the rank
and file in other States to be too confident
and thus make them apathetic is great
enough to be looked after. Bryan says if
his party is not successful tnls time it will
come again and again, until Altgeldism
and Bryanism are made the policy ot the
Government, but if the people do their
whole duty during this campaign and on
election day Bryanism will never again be
heard of. Therefore the splendid gain in
Maine ought to stimulate every one who
is desirous that prosperity and peace shall
abound everywhere, and that the Govern
ment shall be maintained on the lines laid
down by Washington and Jeffersou and
Lincoln to make every possible effort to
leave Bryan without representation in the
Electoral College. Let him not carry a
single State.

750,000 more young trees are set out, and the
crop will, therefore, be Increased four-fold in
three or four years when these orchards come
into bearing. And the revenue from this crop
of citrus fruit is immense. Last season Red
lands oranges commanded the best price paid,
and there are half a dozen districts which are
vleing with it for the palm.
"And with all this acreage in oranges, saying
nothing about lemons and deciduousfrult.it
is hardly a beginning on the land in our val
ley. Some Eastern passengers coming up on
the overland on which I took passage looked
out o! the windows as the train sped westward
from San Bernardino and saw nothing bu;
waste and uncultivated land and wondered
what it could be utilized for. Yet but a few
miies off were orange and lemon orchhrds,
stretching away for miles, and the land they
were speaking of is equally productive. Back
in the mountains vast reservoirs are being con
structed, and when the water is Drought down
the whole valley will become one vast orange
orchard.
"The newest thing in mining news is the
road which San Bernardino County has just
completed into Randsburg. The road brings
the trade of that new camp tributary to San
Bernardino, coming in by Victor and the
Cajon Puss. That camp gives greater promise
than any ever discovered in the State. The
original ledge is forty feet across, pay ore all
the way, with a four-foot streak that is fabu
lously rich. Other strikes have been made in
the radius of seven miles, and the camp is al
ready furnishing employment to several hun
dred men, and as soon as the winter rains
come and the temperature moderates the num
ber will be largely increased.
"The intolerable summer on the desert pre
vents prospecting generally, but mining men
tell me that more prospectors will po out this
fall than ever before. The Raudsburg ledgo
and the Desert Queen and other good finds to
the east of us have excited interest in mines,
and the season promises to be an active one.
"Politically we are all torn up, but McKin
ley will come over Tehachapi with a good ma
jority, and we will send Bowers back to Con
gress from the Seventh District. When Bryan
was nominated, and in the few weeks succeed
ing, the free-silver people kicked up such a
dust that we seemed to be lost; but two months
served to clear the atmosphere. It was nothing
to be alarmed at. In one precinct that I know
of, just out of town, a McKinley Club with
forty members has been organized. The
precinct gave Estee but twenty-five votes two
years ngo, and the population is not increased.
In another one the McKinley Club has 106
members, more than half the total number of
voters, and a month ago the Bryan people as
serted that there were not enough Republicans
there to officer a club.
"Of course there are parts of our county
which are strong for the free-silver candidate,
but the Idea that he is going to sweep the
southern counties Is founded on an estimate
of the situation made six weeks ago. The Re
publicans have been at work. The meeting
held in our city three weeks ago, when S. M.
Shortridge was there, has started the ball all
over the county, and the sound-money Demo
crats ai-e also doing noble work. It Mr. Bryan
carries thia State he must look elsewhere than
to Southern California for his majority."
LOS ANGELES REJOICES.
I/O* Angeles Times.
Los Angeles County is benefited in the sum
of $22,000 through the raising of the assess
ment of San Franclpco City and County. Un
der the present adjustment that City and
County must pay taxes upon a valuation of
$425,000,000, being an increase of $70,000,
-000. At one time a reduction of 10 per cent
was proposed for this county, and San Fran
cisco Is said to have been favorable to such re
duction, provided that her own assessment
was permitted to remain at the figures made
by nor Assessor. Deputy District Attorney
Ho", ton went to Sacramento a few days ago In
connection with this matter, and co-operated
with Mr. Arnold, the member of the State
board from this county, to bring about the
prntent result. Under the proposeJ reduction
Los Ame lei would have gained about $4000
iv Uio matter of btute taxes, but under the
ulan Kiirrrssfully engineered by .Mr. Arnold
and Mr. Holton tho saving to our taxpayers Is
*2'J,000, or a net gain of $18,000 over the
scheme advocated by the commercial organi
zations of this city. This county has reason to
congratulate its representatives.
WOOL DEMONETIZED.
Bakersfield Callfornian.
Henry Marshall of Hanford is in receipt of
the following letter from the Shoobert-Beale
Company of San Francisco, wool commission
merchants, which shows how wool has been
"demonetized" by the Wilson bill:
Dear Sir: We are In receipt of your letter Inclos
ing tbe shipping receipt of seventeen bales of fall
wool.
Wool Is to-day absolutely without value, as there
is none selling, and as we have your last fall wool
on nana unsold we do not know when there will
be a market for that class. Under the circum
stances, we can advance you no money on the
wool until business is settled and tbere Is a selling
price. This Is the preliminary effect of the silver
craze, and If men will not get around and vote for
aicKluley matters will be worse.

Free Coinage Under Proper Conditions.

Let it not be forgotten that the Republican
party, which is now being held up as a terrible
example of the goldbug disease, has shown itÂ«

The Distinction.
Chlno Champion.
The fallacy that free and unlimited coinage
of silver means bimetallism is being exploded.
Free and unlimited coinage of silver at 16 to 1
means silver monometallism, because as the
cheaper coin It will drive gold out of circula
tion. The Republican party proposes to main
tain silver on a parity with gold, keeping both
in circulation, and to foster the industrial and
commercial life of the Nation so that an in
creased coinage will go into circulation un
biased and undebased. - â : ;. ~*

Stockton-
Tne demand for deep-water tonnage i?
on the increase, and in consequence quite
a number of vessels are on their way to
this port in ballast. Tramp steamers
have relieved tLe glut in a measure, but
still the shippers of wheat and barley are
anxious to secure more vessels. Rates
have advanced to Â£1 8s 94, but disengaged
vessels are asking Â£1 10s. and the chances
are that the end of the week will see an
advance on even that ngure.
The new arrivals expect to go direct to
the grain sheds, and in consequence anchor
in the mest convenient spot. Many of
them get in the fairway and yesterday the
State tug Governor Markh&m had to be
called into requisition four times in ordsr
to notify the captains to move their res
sets. Chief Wharfinger Root and Assist
ant Chief Wnarfinger Scott were kept on
the jump all day in order to keep the way
clear for the ferry-boats.
Among the arrivals was the ship Meri
oneth from Swansea. Captain Rowland
reports a long passage of 130 days from
Swansea. He has the usual tale of head
winds and heavy weather off the Horn
and calms in the Pacific to tell, but never
theless the vessel made better time than
she did last year. The Merioneth carries
the champion flag, having made the run
from England to this pott in the fastest
time on record. Captain Thomas, now of
the Afon A. aw, was in command, but he
was never able to get the same speed out
of the ship. The Merioneth will load
wheat for Liverpool.
On Friday, July 17, the ship was hove-to
under fore and main lower-topsails.
Thomas Paul was on watch and a heavy
sea that broke aboard carried him away.
A life buoy was thrown to him but he
failed to reach it. An attempt was made
to lower a boat, but the seas were breaking
so heavily that it had to be given up.
Nothing could be done for the unfortu
nate man and bis shipmates had to stand
on the forecastle and watch him drown.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's Aia
meda is going out with one of the biggest
cargoes ever sent to the southern seas on a
passenger steamer. Hundreds of tons of
goods have been refused shipment, and
when sailing day comes there wi;l be many
disappointed shippers. Tne lower hold
and 'tween decks are full and vegetables
and fruit are now being stowed on deck.
The passenger accommodation is also
fully engaged, so the steamer will be one
of the best-filled vessels that has ever
sailed from San Francisco for Australasia.
People are wondering what has become
of the handsome little schooner Una, now
out 86 days from Eureka for San Jose de
Guatemala? This is an unusually long
passage, but then the light winds and
calms that have prevailed on the coast
may have deiayed her. Captain Hark ns
was in command and the BChooner carried
a crew of seven men. In view of the fact
that one of the Italian fishermen saw a
schooner bottom up, or on her beam ends,
off the Golden Gate, some anxiety is felt
on account of the schooner.
A horse and buggy belonging to the
Fulton Iron Works backed off Bryant
street pier yesterday. The driver escaped,
but the horse was drowned.
Another big carrier has been added to
the lumber fleet, says the Coos Bay New-.
The Echo was successfully launched at
North Bend last week. She is a splendid
vessel, one of the largest ever built on the
coast, and when completed will load a
cargo of 1,000.000 feet of lumber at North
Bend for Australia direct.
Potatoes are a drug on Jackson-street
wharf. Like the recent glut in the peir
market, no one seems to want them, and
shippers are actually tending them to
Stockton. The prowers ship them to San
Francisco and the commission men send
them up the river again in order to get rid
of them. The tubers do not pay expenses,
and the farmer is out and injured.
No word has been received from tne
British steamer Linlithgow, that left here
July 31 last. She was bound for Leith
with 4011 tons of wheat and when last
heard from was drifting about off Aca
pulco. Mo assistance was sent to her and
insurance men are now wondering what
has become of her. She was fully manned
and well equipped, but stili she may drift
for weeks before being picked up.
The sealing schooner Jane Gray is under
surveillance by Uncle Sam's Custom-house
inspectors. She was seized in Bering Sea
by the revenue cutter Corwin, and as soon
as Captain Hooper gets back to port
criminal proceedings will be begun against
the captain and officers of the schooner.
ONE MILLION DOLLARS.
A Large Shipment of Gold to the Local
Sob-Treasury.
A week on two ago there was much com
ment upon the fact that many or the
bankers and large financiers of this City
were preseating greenbacks and other cur
rency at the sub-treasury and taking out
gold in large quantities in exchange. It
was feared that this run was for no good
purpose.
Yesterday the local sub-treasury re
ceived $1,000,000 in gold from the sub
treasury m Chicago. This precious ship
ment was made to keep up the supply of
gold on this coast and to partly offset the
recent redemption of currency, which
amounted to about $5,000,000 taken out in
August. In July about $:3,000,00U in gold
was shipped to the sub-tressurv in New
York. It is believed that yesterday's con
signment from Chicago will be all that is
necessary to meet the demands of the
near future, as all of the large payments
sn currency made in the East to Cail
fornia fruit and produce dealers have
been exchanged for gold at the local sub
treasury. At present there is about
$40,000,000 in goid, silver and currency io
tiie sub-treasury, and enough of eacn to
meet the demands of all local and Pacific
Coast business.

" A Matrimonial Maze "
Arouses Mirth at the
Columbia.
SANS GENE'S LAST WEEK
"Ours," a Robertsonian Comejy,
Is Revived at the Alcazar
Theater.
DANGER SIGNAL AT THE GRAND
Hnmperdinck's Beautiful Music Would
Bs Improved by Better
Principals.
The Frawley company has found a
treasu^-trove of laughter in "A Matri
monial Maze," which was produced for the
first time in this City at the Columbia
Theater last night. From the time the
curtain first went up till it fell at the end
of the last act the audience was kept in a
continual flow of mirth by the humorous
aevelopments of the farcical comedy.
Walter S. Craven has well named his
piece "A Matrimonial Maze." The whole
action of the play hinges on a system of
marriages, and the development of the
story is as winding and unexpected as a
good, old-fashionea maze. At every turn
the dramatis persons seem to be coming
to a situation out of which there is no pos
sible outlet, except by a general confession
and explanation, when lo and behold ! by
some ingenious device, another turn is
given to events and the action of the piece
pursues its mazy way as briskly as ever,
till the climax It finally reached, at a point
when continuation in matrimonial deception
has become impossible, except by making out
both the youthful herues to be bigamists and
giving both their fathers breach of promise
suits with elderly housekeepers.
The whole piece is full of comical situations
and a cold pynopsis of its mazy story could
give no idea o! the lun it contains. The im
pression left on the mind is that Harry Corsen
Clarke, as Jakel Musgeridge, M. A., of Oxford,
is one of the worst ill-used characters in faxce
comedy, not excepting the "Private Secre
tary," to whom he bears a strong family re
semblance. Jakel is tutor to two "boys" whose
fathers provide them with a nice flat in New
York City and otherwise minister to their
wants, even to the extent of fiudiug wives for
them.
Now, it happens that the youths have al
ready provided Â£or themselves to the latter
rsspect, but when fear of the parental wrath
strUes them each "boy" introduces his wife
to hi* father as the wife of Jakel Muggeridge.
Each father has seen a different wife and in
the kindness of his heart each trots off to New
York and brings the wlfa he knows, as a joy
ful surprise to JaKel in his country retreat, oy
which means the wretched bachelor suddenly
appears la the light of a hardened bigamist.
These are only a small share of the misfor
tunes which befeh Jakel Muggeridge. M.A..
and all of them affora the audience plenty of
amusement. Harry Corsen Clarke, who had
made nimself up as a pocket edition of Henry
Irving, gave a clever rendering of the tutor's
role. Must o! his misfortunes were met with
the sad expression, -"How very awkward!"
and his mincing, pedantic way of throwing
the phrase at his oppressors' heads never failed
to arouse a laugh.
Maclyn Arbuckie added a good deal to the
success of "A Matrimonial M*xe" by his
spirited delineation of one of tho fathers, a
retired grocer. He was the talking member
of the parental combine. His partner,
Tyrone Power, seldom opened his mouth
except to say "yes." or "no," but he
did that very effectively. Frank Worth
irg and Charles Wyngate were the
"boy," aud the roles of tapir lawful wives
were cleverly taken by Miss Blanche Bates and
Miss Hope Rosa. Miss Alice Plxley and Miss
Anna Daly were both good as the Prospective
wives, proposed oy the lathers. The parts of
the two housekeepers, with whom the fathers
contemplated allying themselves, were taken
effectively by Miss Madge Carr Cook and Miss
Phosa McAllister.
At the Baldwin.
"Mme. Sans Qsne" is still interesting Bald
win audiences. Miss Kathryn Kidder wins
plenty of applause nightly, and several other
members of the large cast have become popu
lar with playgoers. Taia la the last week of
"Mme. Sans Gene."
At the Tivoli.
A second hearing only confirms the impres
sion of the great beauty of Humperdlnck's
music, which was given on Sunday night.
Some changes in the cast of "Hansel and
Gretel" might yet make the opera a local hit,
and the Tivo'.i, In its grand opera company,
has excellent artists at its disposition. The
mistake has Deen made by imagining that any
singers were good enough for a fairy
opera, but if a new and better soprano and
mezzo-soprano were put on the fallacy of this
belief would soon be apparent. As it Is, how
ever, "Hansel and Crete." is more than worth
hearing for the sake of the few scenes that are
well sung and for the exquisite beauty of its
orchestral score.
At the Chutes.
There are a number of new features at the
Chutes' Casino this week. The lady who
walks on the ladder of swords commands
quiet but universal attention. Queena De
Rein, the young singer from Ktater <& Blal's,
has some new songs which she sings well, and
the Japanese acrobats and John Garbutt, a
clever foggier, help out the programme.
There is still the mile bicycle race between
two young ladies on the stago and Antonio
Pirri takes his dash down the chutes on a bi
cycle at 10 o'clock.
At the California.
It was only a fair house outside of the gal
lery that greeted Steve Brodie at the Califor
nia, but all enjoyed the Bowery barroom and
kindred scenes. San Francisco audiences are
keen to appreciate the phases of human na
ture as portrayed ia the p>ay. Steve Brodie is
known by reputation throughout the conti
nent, and there is much curiosity to see the
realization of the conception of the Bowery
boy. The theater-going people of this City
have had Sullivan and Corbett as actors, but
it remained for Brodie and his saloon to come
here and r>>und out tne full portrait of a typi
cal American character. The play will run all
the rest oi the week.
At the Alcazar.
The military piece "Ours" was the produc
tion presented at the Alcazar Theater last
evening, and its reception by the sudience
waa at times marked with prolonged applause,
particularly the tableau at the close of the
second act, when there is seen the departure
of the English troops for the seat of war. There
is but a small cast, still each actor and actress
has & good part. Adele Belgarde as Blanche
Haye, the heroine, gave a pleasing
interpretation of the part, while Amy
Lee, who made such a hit in the
character of the servant in "All the Comforts
of Home last week, was charming as Mary
Netley, a part in which repartee and sarcasm
are the chief characteristics. She gave proof
of her thorough understanding o! the char
acter. Mrs. Bates came in for the honors as
Lady Shcndryi-r. J. B. Polk was acceptable as
Prince Pitrovsky and the other participants
gave evidence of careful study. The piece is
well staged and ought to draw well during
tne week.
At the Orpheum.
There was, as urual, a large crowd at the
Orpheum Music Hull last night to witness the
several interesting numbers on the pro
gramme, which were received with much ap
plause and many demands for more, but the
ohief attraction was the last number, the high
wire performance of Abdullah, which is san
satloniil in t.ie highest degree. The per
former ascends a tight-wire from the back of
:he Â«;asfe to the Ceiling, the wire being sev- j
er.ty-tive feet long and at an angle of 45 de
grees. With a Japanese umbrella, instead of 1
a balanclnf-poiÂ», he ascends rapidly, and
then, standing upright on the wire, slides
down backward with a rapidity that causes
those who witness the act to bold their breath.
The performance is daring and thrilling.
Grand Opera-House.
The first performance of "The Danger Slg
na." was presented last night with lovable
little Lottie Williams in the leading role and
laughable Edward J. Heron to furnish a well
sustained thread of humor that balances the
piece and prevents it from appearing more pa
thetic than an ordinary audience wishes for in
an eveniug's entertainment.
The interest is held to the last through a
combination of uncertain love affairs that
leave the spectators guessing at the outcome
an 1 generally surprised at the final turn of
affairs. Way out in Wyoming at a little place
called Laramie Bena is an o.d station-master
i and his motherless daughter, a wild prodnct oi
mining-camp iife and rough surroundings,
who plays poker for money with the best of
them because no one ever suggested that it
was wrong.
A regiment of United States soldiers takes
up its station la the neighborhood. A dashing
young lieutenant pays attention to the pretty,
vivacious, but strong-minded little girl and
she poses for his sketches. A young borderman,
i who has been an ardent admirer for years, be
, comes threateningly jealous. T.-.ere is an
Eastern girl betrothed to the lieutenant, and
to complicate matters she appears upon the
scene, the lieutenant's mother gets wind of
his mountain charmer, and she hastily de
termines to avoid the possibility of what she
considers an unequal social match.
In the midst oi it all, a train is robbed, and
the station master is seen late that night to
fight with aud hurl a man into the water near
the scene of the robbery. The absolute disap
pearance oJ trie roober and the strong circum
stantial evidence against the stationmaster
form a combination that makes < the old man
live in constant fear, until at last the mis^in?
man turns up alive aud the father sees his
daughter unitea with the brave man after the
lieutenant and his Eastern girl have suffered
the keenest remorse. There are many good
biis o! acting in the piece with plenty of
thrilling incidents and realistic scenery.
THE LETTER-CARRIERS.
Ratification Meeting in Connection With
the National Convention Coin-
ing Here in 1897.
The San Francisco Letter-carriers' Con
vention Association held its first meeting
for the ratification of having received the
next National convention for this City in
1897.
Secretary Trieber reported that he had
received word from tae delegates at Grand
Rapids, Mich., that San Francisco had
been voted the convention on the first
ballot; that New York City had voted in
a body, casting seventy votes fcr this City,
and other Eastern cities had done the
same thing. The delegates from this City
had been serenaded by the New York Let
ter-carriers'band of fifty pieces and right
royally treated.
The'association decided to issue souve
nirs with pictures or the past Postmasters
and other information concerning the
Postoffice, and as soon as the committee is
ready the contract for printing them will
be awarded and they will be issued to the
general public early next year.
A committee consisting of Thomas E.
Finnegan. George W. Spilier, Frank E.
Smith, James H. Smith and Conrad
Irieber was appointed to raise funds
and issue the souvenir. It was
thought that from |6000 to $3000 would
have to be raised. Letters were read
from business firms offering assistance,
and it was decided to jrive entertainments
to htlp raise that amount. Over 400 dele
gates will have to be entertained during
tiie convention. A committee on arrange
ments will cc appointed at neit meeting.
Thanks were given to the Southern Pa
cific and Wells, Fargo & Co. for transport,
ing the wii:e given the delegates by vari
ous firms free or charge to Grand Kapids-
Sued on a Contract.
Henry J. Withers, a foreign coal merchant,
has sued John J. Moore for $11,186 24, which
sum includes $5000 damages. and a balance
alleged to bÂ« due on a contract made between
the parties by which Moore agreed to purchase
two cargoes of coal from the plaintiff. ,

DR. RAGAN IS ON
RAINEY'S SLATE
The Chairmanship of the
Junta Convention
Decided.
A MERRY ROW TO-NIGHT
Rainey and Lanigan Completely
Control the Small End of
the Party.
COLIN M. BOYD FOR MA YOB.
Some of the Defeated Anti-Rainey
Minority Talk of Bo ting, and
Trouble Nears.
Dr. D. F. Ragan is to be the permanent
chairman of Sam Rainey' s municipal con
vention, which will convene in Odd Fal
lows' Hall to-nignt.
This and other features of the slate were
fixed up last night at a late caucus of the
leading lieutenants of Rainey and Lani
gan and some of the "anarchists' of the
Junta campaign committee who have gone
into a deal to support the Rainey-Lanigau
programme.
Dr. Ragan will probably not be tem
porary chairman, however. C. A. Rey
nolds is likely to be named for that posi
tion.
The fact that the convention has been
won "hands down" by Rainey and Lani
gan was generally conceded by the fright
ened and despairing anti-Raineyites about
headquarters last night. Rainey will ran
the convention.
For the first time close friends of W. P.
Sullivan conceded last night that Mr.
Sullivan was in danger of going down in
the wreck of anti-Raineyites. He wiJl be
the anti-Rainey candidate for chairman
and the vote on chairman will to a Jar^e
degree measure the strength of the Rainey
and the anti-Rainey factions. The Rainey
ites gleefully say that to-night Mr. Sulli
van will be chucke 1 off fhe political 3tage.
The convention promises to be a merry
if not a sensational row and full of sur
prises. But the Rainey jtiggernaut-car
will roll right along to tne end, crushing
the political hopes, a whole lot of "de
cent" but kindergarten politicians.
There is all sorts of talk of bolting, and
a bolt will likely occur, but it will prob
ably be a little one after all and;it won't
amount to much.
Samuel braunhart will not bolt, at least
until the nomination for Senator in the
Seventeenth District is made. Hart is in
his fight, and it is generally conceded that
he will easily win the nomination in spite
ol the Rainey-Daggett efforts to defeat
him.
Max Popper, who has threatened bolt
ing, was a little dazed and uncertain last
night.
"I never in my life knew less about a
convention on the day before," he said.
"I don't know whether or not Rainey haa
the convention, but the cnairmanship
fight will telL As to bolting, I will not
cross a bridge nntil I come to it.
The chairmanship right was all the talk
about headquarters last nieht among the
people who were not on the "inside" with
the Raineyites. Besides Chairman Sulli
van, Dr. Ruttanzi. Attorney Joseph
O'Donnell, Dr. Ragan and Alex Vogel
sang were talked about amid the uncer
tainty, while the Rainey- Lanigan caucus
was coins on elsewhere.
Colin M. Boyd, one of Sam Rainey s
Fire Commissioners, is to be the candidate
for Mayor. Jimmy Phelan appears to be
out of the race with the McNab-Sullivan-
Popper minority.
Gavin McNab, however, kept everybody
guessing about where he was, as usual.
There is a widespread report and belief
that, finding Rainey and Lanigan in con
trol, he has made terms and will get some
recognition out of what Kainey doesn't
want.
City and County Attorney Creswell,
Auditor Broderick and Treasurer Block
are to be renominated as a reward for their
recognition of the Junta.
WARRING DEMOCRATS.
They Failed to Agree Even In
Harmony Hal!.
The warring factions of the Junta De
[ mocracy of the Thirty-fourthAssemblyDi?
-! trict, as represented by twenty-live dele
pates to the municipal convention, met
last evening in Harmony Hall for the pur
pose of patching up disputes and securing
harmony. But not even the name of the
hall could effect tne desired object, and
ttie conference terminated after a pro
tracted executive session.
All that was done was the election of
Robert Mann as chairman of the delega
tion.
George Â£. Gallagher, the bright young
i leader of the opposition to Sullivan and
j McNab, left the hall after a forcible
speech, in which he accused Chairman
Mann of having attempted to take an un
fair advantage of his side of the contro
versy by the "rawest kind of work."
FOR PALMER AND BUCKNER
Sound-Money Democrats Out With
Their Petitions.
Having decided to put a Palmer and
Buckner electoral ticket in tne field in
this State tne Sound Money Democratic
League- is pushing its campaign for the
National Democracy with speed and vigor.
Yesterday blank petitions were ordered
printed and to-day will be on the streets of
this City and on their way to patriotic
sound-money Democrats throughout the
State who are actively interested in the
cause.
To get the electors on the ticket requires
filing with the Secretary of State a peti
tion bearing nearly 9000 names or 3 per
cent of the vote of the State. The blank
petiiions are made up in book form and
are of three sizes. Some have room for
100 names, some for 200 and some for 500.
These will be busily circulated to-day and
during the next two weeks. The petition
mnst be riled in Sacramento on October 3
at the latest, and all petitions will be
ordered returned by the 23th inst.
Secretary Elliott McAllister is over ears
in the work and is enthusiastically inter
ested.
"It will be little trouble to get the
names," said McAllister yesterday, "as a
majority of the citizens would readily sign
the petition whether they are interested in
Palmer and Huckner or not. To-morrow
we will starl out six or eight paid canvass
ers here in the City, and the members of
the league will carry petiiions with them
and get signatures. We expect thatabout
2000 signatures will be secured by our cor
respondents throughout the State.
"We will not have as extensive co
operation in Los Angeles as we expected,
as the Sound Money League there has
joined with the Business "Men'a Sound
Money Club, and will actively support
McKinley, thus tiring ootb barrels at the
common enemy, as it has been expressed.
"We, of coarse, do not care whetner a
sound-money Democrat votes for McKin
ley and Hobart or Palmer and Buckner,
our object being to defeat Bryan and the
Populist element that has gained tempo
rary control of the party.
"Our electoral ticket was decided upon
because there was a great demand from
the country that the movement be put
through in unison with the National
movement, and also because it was found
that a great many Demcorats who would
not support McKinley wanted a ticket
they could conscientiously support.
"Then four year 3 from now when the
Populists are out of it the National De
mocracy of this campaign will be the cen
tral party organization and control the
National Convention and the delegation
from our organization will be recognized
as the legimate one."
Populist Convention.
The Populist Municipal Convention will
meet this evening in the County Commit
tee's tent on Market street, near Larkln,
for tne purpose of nominating candidates
lor municipal offices to be defeated by the
Republican candidates. Dr. Jerome An
derson and J. Taylor Roeers are men
tioned for the mayoralty, Dr. i)aj wait for
Coroner. J. \V. Reay for County Clerk, J.
D. Thompson for Superintendent of
Streets, A. VV. Thompson, Wiiiiam T.
Bageett and Judges Hunt and Hebbard,
Republicans', for Superior Judges.
Socialist* Undisturbed.
There was an open-air meeting last night at
the corner of Pine and Kearny streets, under
the auspices of the Forty-fifth District Club of
the Socialist Labor party. George Barnaby
presided and made an address dealing with
the moral and legal phases of socialism. T. M.
Anthony and Alvin Appel also spoke. There
was no attempt at interference on the part of
the police, though the roadway on Pine street
juÂ»t east of Kearuy was well filled with
auditors.

and A. F. Chapman of the Journal
of Commerce:
Colonel H. Z. Osborne, publisher of the
Los Angeles Express, was in the City yes
terday with cheering news of Republican
prospects in that county. The silver men
have been boasting recently that they will
carry that county, because two years ago
the vote stood:
Populists, 4100.
Democrats, 7600.
Republicans, 11,250.
On the foregoing ratio, under the so
called fusion, Mr. Bryan and his million
aire partner, Mr. Sewall, would receive
11,700 votes, while McKinley would get no
more than 11,250 votes. But times have
changed since then. There are a whole
lot of those same Democrats and Populists
who have refused to indorse the anarch
istic planks of the Chicago platform ; who
have expressed their intention of voting
for protection to the products of American
labor, and who believe that the American
workingman, the clerk in the store, the
bookkeeper, the author, the musician, the
painter and every other man who earns
his living by the sweat of his brow or the
labor of his brain should receive a dollar
worth 100 cents all over the civilized world,
and with the same purchasing power as
that of the silver dollar of to-day.
Colonel Osborne is confident, by reason
of the investigations which he has made,
that a large majority of the voters of his
county will vote for patriotism, protection
and prosperity.
Republicans are getting well organized,
and are doing effective work in a quiet
way. Not having any of Senator Stewart's
campaign sack, they have not shocked the
welkin wit h brass bands and the strident
roar of unprincipled hirelings announcing
that under the operation of the free coin
age act a barrel of big bright silver dollars
would be placed on every corner in order
that the workingman for whom Senator
Btewart's $40,000,000 heart is bleeding
might help himself and treat his wife and
children to diamonds, sealskins, roast
turkey and champagne.
Colonel Osborne related an occurrence
showing that deep down in the American
heart there slept a sentiment of loyalty
that when the time came could always be
depended upon to rally for the defense of
American honor and American institu
tions. The story went that a farmer
whose home lay away off in that part of
the Mojave desert lying between Mojave
and Los Angeles came to Los Angeles last
week for the purpose of buying a store of
provisions. He was asked by a Republican
friend as to the sentiment in his part of
the country, his friend telling him of a re
port to the effect that all the voters up his
way had been hypnotized by Senator
Stewart's silver wand.
The farmer was surprised at the state
ment.
"All the change that has taken place
up there," he said, "is this. Two Repub
licans have declared themselves in favor
of free silver and two Democrats have an
nounced that they intend to vote for pro
tection and sound money. That's all the
change there is, and you may rely upon it
that my precinct will roll up the usual
Republican majority."
Colonel Osborne said further that the
free silver club of Los Angeles County
had largely increased its membership on
hearsay. As a proof of this statement he
instanced the fact of eight Democrats
whose names were placed on the roll and
who afterward said tuat they were gome
to vote for McKinley, and that theif
names had been signed on the boots of
tbe club without their consent or even
Knowledge.
Alfred Holraan of the Rural Press, in re
ply to a Call reporter's questions on
financial matters, said:
'I have never believed, and I find less
reason to believe the more I study the
subject, that the United States can, by its
individual action, maintain a relative
equality between the values of gold and
silver. It appears to me that an attempt
to do so would have the immediate effect
of putting this country upon a silver
basis, with the 10,000 hardships and disad
vantages of a reduced standard and of a
shifting unstable currency. I believe it
would destroy our commerce, and what is
infinitely more serious, would destroy the
credit of our country for common honesty.
"I don't believe that the majority of oar
people are willing to pay their debts in
fifty -cent pieces, nor do I believe that they
are ready to surrender the policy of pro
tection to American industries and to
American labor, under whicn our best ad
vancements in National and material
prosperity have been made. In my judg
ment the shifting of this campaign from
the issue of protection to the issue of the
currency is largely artificial. I believe
the question of protection to be of infin
itely more importance to the welfare of
the country and J don't question that be
fore the campaign is ended protection will
have assumed its proper place as the para
mount issue.
"There are, lam told, very many peo
ple in California who make light of the
protection issue, deeming it of minor im
portance to the currency, but it appears to
me that they are neglectful of the fact that
all the larger interests of California are
bound up in the policy of protection, and
that the welfare of the producers of Cali
fornia is absolutely dependent upon the
maintenance of that policy."
A. F. Chapman, business manager of
the Ban Francisco Journal of Commerce,
said:
â¢'I think that the adoption of free coin
age by the United States would be the
greatest calamity that could possibly hap
pen, and would intlict an injury greater
upon the working classes than upon any
other portion of the people. With refer
ence to the proposition that the advent of
cheap money is accompanied by high
prices, I would say that the experience of
all mankind has been, in such a case, chat
the wages of labor are always the last to
respond to any advance in prices.
"The advance In prices would be a hard
ship on the workingman and wage
earner generally, because while ins wages
would remain at a standstill, there being
plenty of idle men ready and willing to
take his place, he would be obliged to pay
much more lor rent and other necessaries
of life than he does now under a sound
money basis.
"I have held these ideas with regard to
silver for many years. I have looked upon
it and I have found it to be one of the
great productions of the country, the
price of which is governed by supply and
demand. It is simply a cominodrtv like
iron or copper. While it is useful for sub
sidiary coinage to the amount that the
Government can keep at a parity with
gold, it would be absolutely impossible for
the Government to Keep it at a ratio of 16
to 1 under the free-coinage bill. I cannot
imagine in what manner it would stimu
late industry outside of the employment
of a few more men in the silver mines of
the Pacific Coast and Mexico."
HIS ELECTION SURE.
What O. L. Morrow of Ohio Says
of McKlnley's Prospects.
O. L. Morrow, partner in the McKeehan-
Hiestar.d Grocery Company of Hillsboro,
Ohio, one of the largest wholesale con
cerns in the country, has been a guest at
the Occidental Hotel for a few days with
his wife. â He is here on a tour of observa
tion and pleasure, and last evening he
and his wife left for Los Angeles. They
will take in some of the principal cities in
the State.
Mr. Morrow is a personal friend of ex-
Governor Foraker and is a keen observer
of political movements. He is a stanch
Republican and said that the indications
throughout tne East are that McKinley
will be elected by the greatest majority
ever known in a Presidential election.
"If," said Mr. Morrow, "the election
had come off shortly after the Chicago
convention I believe Mr. Bryan would
have swept the country, but people have
had time to think and the tide is surely
turning."
Mr. Morrow is high up in the Masonic
California Sound-Money League Meeting at the Chamber of Commerce.
order. He is an old acquaintance of Ser
geant C. P. Wright nt police headquarters
and called upon him several times during
his brief stay here. He will spend a few
days more here after his return from the
south.
The Thirty-First District.
The Thirty-first District Club met last
evening at the Phoenix Athletic Club Hall,
j corner of Eighth and Folsom streets,
j about 400 members being present. Ernest
j McKennan delivered a ringing address in
favor of Republican principles and as
serted that the only salvation of the coun
try from its present impoverished condi
tion lies in electing McKinley and Hobart
in November. His efforts were warmly
applauded and the club indorsed his can
didacy for the office of Superior Judge.
Edward Sweeney followed with an elo
quent and witty address. Frederick Me
j Gregor then addressed the club at length
! on the silver question, eliciting hearty ap
plause and an'indorsement for the oilice of
Justice of the Peace.
Don't Give Him Money.
Complaint has been made to the officers
of the Thirty-ninth Assembly District
regular Republican Club that some person
has been collecting money in the name of
the club. This the officers wish stopped,
and say that the only parties authorized
to collect money for political purposes for
the benefit of the club and Republican
party are the finance committee, which is
composed of Oscar Tolle, M. M. Barnet
and L. Levin. Those gentlemen have
credentials signed by John Gilspn, presi
dent of the club.

Workingmen Said to Be Almost
a Unit for McKinley and
National Honor.
TIDE TURNING AGAINST BRYAN
Solid Business Men Come to the Front
for the Welfare of Their
Country.
There was an enthusiastic convention of
sound-money Democrats and Republicans
at the Chamber of Commerce yesterday
afternoon for the purpose of organizing a
league to do missionary work in the cause
of honest money and National honor.
A committee consisting of H. P. Sonn
tag, H. H. Williams, Julian Sonntag, C.
D. Salfield and C. D. Houghton reported
in favor of calling the organization the
California Sound-money League and their
report was adopted.
Architect Charles Smith made a speech
on the outlook, wherein he said: "There
is little doubt that most of the laboring
men of this City are for sound money.
All they need is a little good missionary
work and they ara safe."
Oscar Lewis of the Builders' Exchange
replied to Mr. Smith, saying: "The gen
tleman is simply mistaken. Do not solace
yourself with such a hope, for I find that
many, if not most, of the laborers have
gone wild on the free-silver craze. It
needs good work to save them."
The chairman of the meeting, Henry J.
Crocker, stated tuat the league was organ
ized to second the efforts of the Republi
can Central Committee. He said there
was no desire to oppose the committee in
any way, but 10 render it every possible
aid. The purpose of the meeting and of
the society, he said, was to do all possible
for the cause of sound money.
Horace Davis was unanimously elected
chairman, Franfc Brown declining to run
jin opposition. H. J. Crocker was elected
secretary, and Thomas Brown, a life-long
Democrat, treasurer.
Foreman Johnson of the Union Iron
Works made an enthusiastic speech for
McKinley, stating that most of the em-
Sloyes there are to-day for sound money
Le believed tnere ought to be organiza
tion, and that literature ought to be sent
j among the laborers of the City.
C. D. Salfield, president of "the Panhan
dle Improvement Club, spoke enthusias
tically for sound money, saying tuat the
majority of those who belong to forty im
provement clubs in the City are for sound
money. Each day he heard of Bryan men
who are beginning to see the light and to
declare for sound money.
The club adjourned subject to the call of
the chairman, the following signing the
roll:

RAILROAD MEN'S
REPUBLICAN CLUB
Permanently Organized in
Native Sons* Hall
Last Night.
A LARGE ENROLLMENT.
With Music and Speeches an
Enjoyable Evening Was
Spent
THE ENTHUSIASTIC LISTENERS
Each Week Orators Will Be Heard
Upon the Principles of the
St. Louis Platform.
The United Railroad Employes' Repub
lican Club was permanently organized
last night in Native Sons' Hall on Seven
teenth street, near Valencia. It was a
grand gathering of hardy and intelligent
men that filled the place of meeting when
John F. Clarke, foreman of the construc
tion department of the Market-street
Railway Company, officiating as tempo
rary chairman, called the meeting to
order.
Secretary Meacham read the following
report from the committee on permanent
Organization:
We beg leave to report and recommend that
the name of this club shall be "The United
Railroad Employes' Republican Club," and
that its object is to advance the interests of its
members and to unitedly support the prin
ciples of the Republican party as denned in
the St. Louis platform and the letter of accept
ance of the Hon. William McKinley, Republi
can candidate for President of the United
States; to aid by all honorable means in the
election of William McKinley for President and
Garrett A. Hobart for V ice-President and the
Republican Congressional and Legislative
candidates, believing that the success of the
Republican Darty will insure National pros
perity, which means personal prosperity to the
individual workingmen of the whole country.
We earnestly ask the hearty and harmonious
co-operation of each individual member of the
club to bring about this grand result.
The roll of membership shall be made
up of the five organizers of the origi
nal "United Railroad Employes' Repub
lican Club"â W. H. Philpot, J. H. He-
Cluer, John Leach, F. W. Francis, John
Sparksâ and of the employes of street railway
companies who may desire to join the club,
said roll to contain, with the above exception,
the names of those onlf in the actual employ
of such companies operating in the City and
County of San Francisco.
Thanking those gentlemen who have assisted

Seymore, F. E. Meacham.
In taking the chair W. C. Carpenter
said: "We have assembled here to-night
for one and the same purpose, and we will
co-operate to make this political organiza
tion one of the most powerful this side of
the Missouri River."
Chairman Carpenter then introduced
Hon. Eugeqe F. Loud, who was greeted
with cheers.
The Congressman did not speak at
length, but rather to the point, reviewing
the question of finance, and his words met
with appreciation. He prefaced his remarks
with the statement that his would have
been a positive loss if he had been unable
to address an audience such as had
gathered to enroll under the banner of the
Railroad Employes' Republican. Club.
"You, gentlemen," said the speaker
"who have to contend with so much from
early sunrise until far into the nieht
represent a class of map who know how
to think and weigh matters according to
their worth, and it is gladdening to see
you grouping about the standard-bearers
of Republicanismâ McKinley and Hobart.
"You belong to a class of men which
must use good judgment, tact and intel
ligence at all times from the moment you
encounter the crabbed dyspeptic whose
digestion failed him in the forenoon un
til you land the befuddled individual at
his home door in the we small hours of the
early morning. It is no ordinary man
who can do this with good judgment de
liberation and mild te.ni perâ he must be an
intelligent and superior man. I am
therefore, pleased that we belong to the
same party."
A humorous speech was made by Secre
tary Cook, and 8. W. Dockworth also de
livered a short address.
The club expects that at the next meet
ing (Monday night) the roll, which has al
ready reached 1200, will be twice as large
AS A RAY OF LIGHT.
Presbyterian Pastors Discuss the Snb
etance of the Resurrected Body.
An interesting address was given before
the Presbvteiian ministers yesterday by
Dr. W. F. Cheeney. M.D., on "The Resur
rection of the Body." The doctor spoke
from a physical standpoint, which, how
ever, he said he did not believe precluded
belief in the church's doctrine of the
resurrection.
'"I believe in the resurrection of the
body. 1 Such.are the words of the apostles'
creed and they demand strong faith, for
science tends to deny rather than confirm
them." The doctor said that the chief
outlet left by science was belief i n the
omnipotence of God. He described the
component elements of the human body,
the way in which they are dissolved after
death, adding that man can take these
tissues apart, but he has not yet learned to
put them together again; that is a secret
knowri only to God.
'â¢These component factors," he said
"are loaned by nature for a few years from
the general store. They are the slaves
for a short time, to something that guides
them for good or ill. There may be atoms
in yon and me to-day that formed part of
a gladiator's body in the Colosseum.
'â¢If tne body is to be reconstructed again
at the resurrection whence are to come
the materials?"
In answer to this Question Dr. Cheeney
read an extract from Hall, which he said
cast a ray of light on the case. It was re
garding sowing and reaping, and drew
attention to the fact that a man does not
sow the actual grain he reaps. He casts
grain into the ground, and the grain he
reaps is not the identical grain he sows.
In the discussion Rev. Dr. Farrand, after
heartily indorsing the sneaker's views,
said that he believed the X ray was becin
ning to show tha possibility of a man hav
ing another body, encased in and identical
with his actual material body. He thought
it possible that this would be the body
which would rise at the resurrection.
Congregational Club.
"Joy in the Lord's Service" was the sub
ject of yesterday's address at the Congre
gational Monday Club. The speaker, Rev.
J. H. Strong, said that real Christian joy
springs from a consecrated purpose, and
that neither suffering, imprisonment nor
torture can destroy it. Joy is the result
of entering the Lord's service in the right
spirit and adhering to that spirit. It is
not to be the aim of the service, but will be
its logical result.
In the discussion all the speakers agreed
with ReT. Mr. Strong.
SAN BRUNO NEGLECTED.
The Authorities Ignore Its Wants and
Leave Residents to Look Out for
Themselves.
The residents of the San Bruno road
are up in arms againat the City authori
ties and the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company and for a cause of complaint
they charge general neglect and an isola
tion from the balance of the City.
One of their grievances is that the Super
visors are indifferent as to the manner in
which this portion of the City is treated
regarding protection against fire. There
is no such thing as a hydrant to be seen
anywhere along the San Bruno road, nor
are there any water mains, but there is a
reservoir within a quarter of a mile of the
road, with an elevation of eighty feet,
which would give a pressure sufficient for
all purposes.
Another grievance is that the gas com
pany has refused to extend its supply to
the residents in the southern portion of
town.
The distribution of letter-boxes, also,
shows discrimination and neglect, and
it not for Frank Grabe, an old resident of
the valley, who acts without compensa
tion as postmaster, keeping stamps and
taking care of mail matter, the residents
would have to come into the Mission to
mail a letter.
But the more strenuous cause of com
plaint is found in the horsecars of Mr.
Vining that do service on that road.
To go from the foot of Post street and
Market to the end of tt:e horsecar line it
takes just one hour and twenty minutes â
about the same time it takes to reach San
Jose. Consequently, the people on the San
Bruno road are compelled to forego the
pleasure of coming into the City after
night.
The last borsecar from Twenty-fourth
street leaves at 11:30â too early to permit
persons reaching home who may wish to
visit the theater or join in societies, as
they must leave the City proper at 10:30
in order to get to their own beds that
night. Tuis the people out there claim is
simply an outrage. They subscribed
$5000 to build the road, and were promised
that they should have good traveling ac
commodations.
After 8 o'clock in the evening these cars
run only every thirty minutes, and dur
ing the daytime every twent}'-five min
utes, taking half an hour to make the trip
or one hour to make the round trip.
Socialists Hear Father Yorke.
Quite a large number of Socialists and their
sympathizers were present last night at the
Metropolitan Temple to hear Father Yorke dis
cuss the attitude of the Catholic church and
labor. Invitations to attend the lecture, and
to seats on the platform, had been extended to
several prominent Socialists, including RÂ»v.
J. E. Scott, editor of the Socialist, and Theo
dote Lynch of the State Executive Committee
of the Socialist Labor party.
Brannschweieer Arrested.
Herman Braunsehweiger Jr., who married
Sadie Nichols, was arrested last night on a
warrant charging him with battery. The com
plaining witness is Ella Holsten, his sister-in
law.

TALKS ON LABOR
The Golden Rule and the
Pope's Encyclical Com
mended.
CRUEL MASTERS SCORED.
Seme of the Things the Catholic
Church Has Done for
Workingmen.
ESTABLISHED THE OLD GUILDS.
" The Speaker Denounces Thos3 Who
Overwork Little Children and
Rcb Grown Men.
Rev. Father Peter C. Yorke lectured to
a large and enthusiastic audience at
Metropolitan Temple last night on capital
and labor, the exact theme, however,
being "The Son of the Carpenter." The
address was plain and practical, the
speaker dwelling on child labor, overwork
and under-rest and like themes, quoting
largely from the Pope's encyclical letter
on kindred themes.
The speaker was introduced by Joseph
Ltggett, who said he was proud that the
Woman's Liberal League had selected him
to introduce so charming a speaker.
"This lecture ought to give a tine idea,"
said the speaker, "or what an eloquent
Catholic thinks of the cause of iabor.'
When he stepped forward amid great
applause Father Yorke said : "Ladies and
gentlemen, though I shall speak of labor
I have become such a victim of the pre
lude habit that I have a word or two to
say about Rev. Mr. Fleenor [laughter], an
A. P. A., and a blessing in disguise. He
is not muck to look at, little to listen to
and bad to smell. For several weeks they I
have attacked the Jews and Catholics, |
and now, true to the instincts i
of a reverend blackguard, Fleenor !
attacks Catholic women. Yesterday be
fora Quitzow the pure Fleenor applied to \
Catholic women names not to be tolerated j
in barrooms.. [Cheer 3.] It is now time to j
show up Fleenor with the balance. Let j
us ask why he signs himself 'from' Seattle ;
and why he left Oakland?"
The speaker then dropped this branch of
the subject and began the discussion of j
the labor questiou, saying: "There are j
20,000,000 people in this country who live
on wages, three and a half million of
whom are women. Whatever helps the
wage-earners helps the masses, yet the A.
P. A. would ruiu the organizations ot
wortingnien. Thank God, the Catholic i
church is the church of the people, even
of hod-carriers, if yon will have it so, the
church of the great laboring masses â a
church whose structures were built by
the pennies of the poor. It is open all
day for even the humblest. There are no
private interests in the way of the priest,
who has neither wife nor child. The poor
est man may command him to the sick
bed at midnigtjt. [Applause.] This is all
in keeping with the religion of Him that
had not where to lay his head. The Cath
olic church went out into Rome teaching
tue dignity of labor, settiug its face like
flint against all opposition to the idea of
the dignity of labor. We do better now
than those who come to this platform
swindling their clients and living on
sb&rne.
"The old monks taught the people how
to work, now to farm, and the great cities
grew up around tne monasteries where it
was taught. 'To work is to pray.' Re
member, too, that the church established
the great guiids and workingmen's so
cieties. In the middle ages the rich were
not able to grind the faces of the poor, be
cause of the protecting influence of the
church."
Coming to the present the speaker said
that Pope Leo's recent encyclical called at
tention to the fact that there can be no
permanent settlement of the differences I
between capital and labor until the Golden
Rule is applied to all. "Against the eter
nal law of supply and demand," be said,
"the everlasting sphinx of the dismal
science, Christianity offers the benign
Golden Rule. They care not whether the
poor get work or not, so they can get
rich. I say let us relegate political
economy to the north pole and
live awhile by the rnles of the
gospel. Capital and labor must cume to
some agreement. I believe in wages and
fair play, and believe, too, tnat the work
ingmen have a right to assemble. If a man
mases a contract to pay bis laborer less
than a living wage the contract is void by
nature's law. The employer who forces
down wages, depending for his success on
men's necessities, commits a crime. It
does not sati&fy justice that the employer
forces the poor wretch he hires to a
minimum, just because the poor worker
is struggling between the devil and the
deep sea- [Cheers.] Every cent earned
in this way is a sin that cries to God for
vengeance."
The speaker deprecated the practice of
many girls who work for low wages to
make "pin money," thereby forcing poor
men and women in heed to work for al
most nothing.
He read the Pope's denunciation of the
practice of working children, held that all
children ought to be educated, and
pleaded for a Sabbath for every working
man, a day tree from toil.
In conclusion he said that the American
Protective Association was a thing insti
tuted by capital to divide labor.'and, by
preventing strikes, reduce laborers to the
condition of serfs.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE ITEMS
A Largely Attended Executive
Meeting of Precinct Club
Presidents,
The Ladies Will Have a Delightful
Outing en Mount Tamalpais
Tc-Morrow.
The lady presidents of the woman'>
mil. age precinct clubs held an important
executive session yesterday afternoon in
the lecture hall cf the Woman Suffrace
Bureau. The meeting was largely at
tended, over 100 ladies being present,
among whom were Mrs. Lovell White,
Mrs. J. F. Swift, Mrs. Judge Cross, Mrs.
H. A. Hobe, Mrs. Senator Mahoney, Miss
(Sheldon, Mrs. Judge Cotton. Mrs. M. H.
.lohnson, Miss Miller, Mrs. Harland and
Mrs. Kirby Brown.
Mrs. Clara Long, the City precinct or
ranizer, presided, in conjunction with
Mis* Mary G. Hay, State organizer.
The reports presented by the ladies
were of a most encouraging character.
Mrs. Carrie Cbapman-Catt gave the
willing workers a few pointers on the
manner in wnich the woman suffrage
campaign was brought to a successful
issue in Colorado, dwelling especially
upon the methods employed by the ladies
in the city of Denver. * These methods,
which she detailed at some length, might,
she thought, prove effective iv San Fran
cisco.
Miss Hay talked to the ladies about
money.
''Even the gospel," she said, "could not
be carried inio foreign lands without
money. All the good works that ever
sanctified and glorified humanity have
needed money to realize their aims. The
laborer is worthy of his hire, and the suf
frage worker certainly should have her
food and carfare."
Plans for raising funds for carrying on
the campaign were then submitted to the
assembled ladies, and arrangements made
for a series of parlor meetings to be held
in all ot the Assembly districts of the City.
It looks as though to-morrow's excur
sion to Mount Tamalpais would be a grand
affair. The guests will leave by the 1:45
boat, and on reaching the mountain-toD
an enjoyable programme will be presented.
Miss Anthony will make an address, and
several ladies of the Woman's Press Asso
ciation will contribute to the day's enjoy
ment. Frank Lincoln, the well-known
impersonator, promises to surprise the
picnickers with s^iie original specialties,
and a most enjoyable outing is antici
pated.
PRINTERS' RAIN CLUB.
A Novel Organization Which Fropoiei
to Defy the Elements on
Thursday Next.
A few months ago there was an outing of
congenial souls to a certain resort in the
country. While all were on pleasure
bent, the heavens frowned and the winds
blew and the rain descended in sheets.
Any other party would have been dis
comn'ted and utterly routed, but not so
this party. A small coterie got together,
made their way to the nearest town, en-
Members of the Olympic Club Displaying Their Skill at the Mechanics' Fair.
gaged a hall and enjoyed the time in de
fiance of the elements.
Such was the origin of the Rain Club.
Its success made the organization blossom
again, and on Thursday the members will
give a second outing to San Rafael Pars.
What will be done has been kept a pro
found secret, but it has leaked out that
there will be an unequaled "time" for all
who attend.
This is amply vouched for by the nameÂ«

the pleasant project :

SAYS SHE WAS KIDNAPED
Mrs Elizabeth Cavanagh Brings
Suit Against Husband and
Son.
Charges That While Confined in an
Asylum They Acquired All Her
Property.
What promises to be a rather sensa
tional suit was filed yesterday by Mrs.
Elizabeth Cavanagh. The lady is pos
sessed of property on Church street, near
Twenty-ninth, valued at $3000, and on Day,
near Churoh, worth probably $12,000. She
came into possession of this about five
years ago through winning a prize in a
lottery company.
In her complaint she alleges that about
six or seven months ago her son, Rob rt P.
Cavanagh, and her husband, Maurice
CaTanagh, kidnaped her from her home at
326 Day street and con fined her in a private
asyfum for four months, during which
period they obtained legal possession of
all her property. This act, she further
states, *vas connived at by her other three
sons.
Her son, Robert P. Cavanagh, is the
owner of t;ie iMoneer dairy at 2415 Mission
street, and was uroucrnt into prominence
some time ajto by the active interest he
took in fome trouble between Milk In
spector Dockery and a dairyman, even
going so far a* to call the attention of the
Board of Health 10 the case.
Cayanagn denies in toto the story told
by hit mother, and says that certain con
ditions arose making it necessary to put
his mother under surveillance. Therefore
he states she was placed in the Magdalen
Asylum, and that while there he paid $25
a month lor her support. Cavanagh's
story in certain details is corroborated by
the neighbors.
The mother states that the income from
her property is $80 a month, but her son
asserts that it will average only $40. If
his mother will comply with certain con
ditions he declares his willingness to Dut
her in any place she wishes. It was about
two years ago, he says, that both bis
father and mother, after certain trouble in
court, agreed upon himself as trustee.
Chas A. Zinkand lias returned from his
summer vacation with bis lomily at Caza
dero. During his absence the Cafe Zin
kand has been under the efficient manage
ment of his sons, Ferdinand and William,
and Mr. yon Rossenn. The cafe is leader
of them all. Everything the best and up

OLYMPIC NIGHT
AT THE FAIR
The Club Assists in Enter

Public.
BOXING AND WRESTLING
A Very Amusing Contest in
Which Blackened Gloves
Were Used.
THE NIW CHARTER ARGUMEH
Why J R. Freud Withdrew From the
D3bate â Pledged to Support
H:me Industries.
It was Olympic Club nieht at the Me
chanics' Institute and Manufacturers' and
Producers' Home Industry Exposition last
evening, and the big Pavilion was filled
liberally by members and friends of the
popular social and athletic institution.
The best athletes of the club were present
and performed their respective parts with
a vim and enthusiasm which was quickly
imparted to the spectators. In the center
of the lower tioor, near the music stand,
an elevated platform was erected, so that
all could obtain a fine view of the wrest
ling, boxing and exhibition ol gymnastics.
The programme by the Olympics con
sisted of the following:
Tumblingâ F. Duck. A. 11. G. Cooper, J. R.
La Rue, W. Linsley. Triple barsâ Professor H.
Belau, R. Leando, W. Linsley. Sandow act-
Professor G. Miehling. FenciiiK (foils)â J. H. i
Horrigan vs. H. Fisher. Fencing (dueling
swords)â E. Ortion vs. Professor L. Tronchet.
Wrestlingâ D. Mahoney vg. . l. Hpiro: W. Butler
v-. 1., p. ArmbruMer. "Boxingâ D. Whalen vs.
M. P. Hayes; E. Kentress vs. g. Carter. Black
ened-glove contestâ J. Reay vs. F. V. Kington.
â Jhe entertainment was given under the
direction of Howard P. Taylor Jr., the
new leader of the club. His initial ap
pearance in the capacity of leader was an
unqualified success. All the events came
off as programmed. There was not a sin
gle hitch, and the outbursts of anplause
from the spectators were frequent and
hearty. During the boxing bouts a ring I
was set up in order to give the affair a
realistic appearance. Mahoney, Spiro,
Butler and Armbruster had a couple of
lively wrestling bouts. Both teams are
clever and gave a splendid exhibition of
the various trick holds and breaks.
Whalen, Hayed, Fentress and Carter com
posed a quartet of shifty boxers. In four
rounds they gave a good idea of the manly
art.
In the boxing line the most interesting
was the contest for points between J\
ReÂ«y and Â¥. V. Kington, in which they
wore gloves covered with lampblack, and
when they finished their exhibition they
looked like a pair of chimney sweeps.
Professor George Miehling gave an inter
esting exhibition of weight-lifting and
feats of strength. A nnmber of the club's
wheelmen attended in their uniform and
the Olympic emblems were to be seen on
all sides. It was a most successful affair
and there was not a single hitch to mar
the programme.
The debate on the proposed new charter
at the Pavilion to-nigh: is exciting a great
deal of attention among those interested
in the adoption or deieat of the measure. I
[ J. Richard Freud, secretary of the Mer- !
chants' Association, intended to answer
the attacks of P. J. Heaiy and John M.
Reynolds, but he fias withdrawn from the
contest on the grounds that neither
Healy nor Reynolds can refrain from
indulging in personalities during an argu
ment. A. P. Van Duser of the Associated
Improvement Clubs has undertaken the
task of taking Mr. Freud's place on the
rostrum.
Mr. Tacy of the Manufacturers' and
Producers- Association, with an able corps
of assistants, is doing great work of a mis
sionary nature teaching the public that
California can produce as good or better
than any State in the East. He had up
to Saturday night secured 5004 pledges of
those who declare that they will purchase
only articles and goods of home industries,
price and quality being equal.

ROBBED A WAREHOUSE.
W. Kelly, Patrick Tally and John
Tully Charged "With Burglary.
The California warehouse on Second and
Townsend streets, owned by Bailey and
Swayne, was entered by burglars on the
night of August 31.
They excavated under the iron door
sufficient to give them a Jeverace and with
a crowbar they raised the door till the
padlock was forced off and entrance was
easy.
The burglars made a careful examina
tion'of the liquor stored in the warehouse
and finally they selected eight cases of
Yellowstone whisky, which they succeeded
in carrying away without being observed.
The burglary was discovered next morn
ing and reported to the Southern police
station. Since then Detective T. L. Ryan
and Policeman Ed ODea, assisted by Spe
cial Officer Kindelon, have been working
on the case.
The burglars had sold six of the cases
to saloon-keepers in the neighborhood of
Howard and Folsom streets, some of
which were recovered. From the descrip
tion of the men who sold them, they, on
Sunday, arrested William Kellj', an ex
convict, Patrick Tully and John Tully and
took them to the Southern Station. The
officers say they have a clear case against
them and know where they consumed
two of the cases themselves.
The three prisoners were removed to the
City Prison yesterday and last night they
were booked on the charge of burglary.
When Kelly was searched a double-edged
knife was icund in his pocket, aud an ad-
ditional charge of carrying a concealed
weapon was booked against him.
Kelly has bÂ°en out of San Quentin less
than a year. Patrick Tuily was arrested
recently for sbootiiie the cook of the
schooner Norma. He and some other
water-front thieves boarded the vessel and
while attempting to break into the cabin
they were surprised by the cook. Tully
succeeded in beating the case.
JUST A CAMPAIGN LIE,
Goodyear Rubber Company Did
Not Threaten Their
Employes.
No Truth in a Bryan Campaign Yarn
Wired From Port'and,
Oregon.
The following notice telegraphed from
Portland, Or., was published in the Ex
aminer yesterday as a campaign sensa
tion, flared up in bold-face type under
startling display lines:
The stockholders and officers of the Good
year Rubber Company wish to have it dis
tinctly understood that a vote for Bryan and
bewail on the part of any of its employes will
be regarded &s an act committed directly
against the welfare of the company and its
employes; and any employe working for or
voting the above-mentioned ticket in the
coming election may expect to be regarded by
the officers as antagonistic to the company.
R. 11. Pease,
Vice-President and Manager, per A. M. Minot.
.. R. H. Pease of this City, vice-president
and manager of the Goodyear Rubber
Company, was asked whether ne had
authorized any such notice. Mr., Pease
said:
"The notice was not posted nor pub
lished in any form by the Goodyear Rub
ber Company. A copy of it was sent to
me by A. M. Minot, a clerk in our house
in Portland. On the day that I received
it, Septembers, I wrote to Mr. Minot that
I did not approve it. When I saw the Ex*
aminer this morning I supposed that he
had posted the notice notwithstanding
my disapproval, and telegraphed him for
an explanation referring to my letter of
September 5, which contained my posi
tive disapproval. He wired in reply that
the notice had not been posted.
"You can state in The Call distinctly,
and have it telegraphed throughout the
Northwest, that tne notice was not sanc
tioned by the Goodyear Rubber Company
nor anyone else authorized to speat for
the company. It was simply dis
cussed by the employes in the Portland
house, and was not even posted in the
store."

SUPERVISORS FILE
A STRONG PROTEST
A Special Meeting Called
to Discuss the Tax
Levy.
SHARP LANGUAGE USED.
Chairman Taylor of the Finance
Committee Is Very
Angry.
NO REMEDY IS AVAILABLE.
Resolutions Passed Condemning the
State Board of Equalize
ton.
For the first time in eight weeks the
Board of Supervisors succeeded in getting
a quorum yesterday afternoon and held a
meeting on the question of the raise made
by tne State Board of Equalization.
Chairman Taylor of the Finance Commit
tee, who has spent the larger portion of
his time for the past ten days on the sub
ject, addressed the board on the matter.
He said:
I desire to call your attention to the stand
up of this City by the Board ol State Equalizer-,
notwithstanding the abundance 01 evidence
sent them from this City by the Merchants'
Association, the Assessor and the local Board
of Equalizers, through its chairman, that the
assessment was already too high.
There has been a great perpetrated
upon the taxpayers of San Francisco by a lot of
scoundrels under the guise of the law. It is
none the less a crime, even if the law gave
them the power.
The great injustice is palpable in the fact
that $3,750 000 is to be taken from the pockets
of the taxpayers of this City without justifica
tion.
It is worse than highway robbery, for the
latter requires courage and the individual
runs the risk of his life in the performance of
Ins business, while these rascals skulk behind
the protection of the law. The facts are evi
dent that they are either incompetent or cor
rupt ana that they are wholly unlit lor a great
public trust, as I propose to show. I desire to
call attention to tne raise applied to this City
in the last six years is 27% per cent and the
raise in all the balance ot me State is 1};, per
cent; also the fraud perpetrated by the iarci
cal amount assessed on solvent debts and
moneys in banks in Los Angeles County.
- Los Angeles County, Witt a population of
150,000. was assessed this year for money,
$314,950. and solvent credits, $ 479.555.
One of its banks alone, the Farmers' and
Merchants' Bank, if assessed according to the
Bank Commissioner's report, should have been
assessed for over $700 ,000 in money and sol
vent credits.
According to the Bank Commissioner's re
port the banks of the city of Los Angeles had
$1, 267,368 in money on hand in March of this
year, yet the whole county ;s assessed for only
$314,950 in money.
Mr. Arnold, the State Equalizer who hails
from Los Angeles, and who purposed to raise
San Francisco's assessment 25 per cent, in
order to equalize between the two counties, as
he called it, holds up Los Angeles County as
an example of good assessment. If the rest of
its property assessed in the same proportion
as its money and solvent credits it makes a
very poor showing.
Mr. Arnold, in moving to increase San Fran
cisco's assessment 25 per cent, ia quoted by
the newspapers a3 bavlag stated: "I do this
because 1 think lhat inasmuch as Los Ang
les has appeared before the board with a raise
of 30 per cent San Francisco should have done
as well. She has increased her roll by about 5
â per cent," and if his motion was carried he
thought it would "equalize matters between
the two counties."
If Mr. Arnold has been quoted correctly, and
I have no reason to doubt that he has, we can
only say: "God save us from such equaliza
tion"'
Los Angeles County was assessed in 1895 at
982,344,875; in 1896 at $98 797,180, being an
increase of 20 per cent, and not 30 per cent, as
Mr. Arnold says. San Francisco was assessed
in 1898 at $327,805,147; in 1896 at $357,586,
-126. being an increase of 9 per cent, and not 5
per cent, as Mr. Arnold says. . .
Hence Mr. Arnold's premises and conclusions
are wrong. He has assisted in - raising San
Francisco 31 per cent over its assessment of
1895. To make San Francisco's increase of as
sessment equal to that of Los Angeles (pro
vided Los Angeles Is as well assessed as San
Francisco) San Francisco should only have
been raited 10 per cent instead of 20 per cent.
But even a raise of 10 per cent is out of ques
tion when you consider that the whole county
of Los Angeles has been assessed for $314,950
in money only.
I hereby enter my most earnest protest
against the action of the State Board of Equal
ization.
It says that there is no wrong without a
remedy, but in this case I think teat the quo
tation fails. This is a great wrong, and I {ail
to see a remedy except through legislation,
and at the present time this Is too far off to
do us any good. I move the passage of the fol
lowing resolution:
Whkreas, Whatever Injustice has been per
petrated by the Mate Board of Equalization in
arbitrarily and without cause raising the. assessed
value of real an. I personal property '20 per
cent for the fiscal year 1896-97. there appears to
be no action whereby our citizens can be relieved
therefrom: and.
Whkr.-as. The question of increasing the as
sessed value of real and personal property as fixed
by the State Board of Equalization is vested in the

NEW YORK MARKETS.
Financial.
. NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 14. -The stock
market was quiet and irregular to-day. The
transactions were only 124, 134 shares, and In this
small total St. Paul represented 29.700 shares,
Sugar 19,000, Burlington 14,100. No Oi be. stock
on the list figures for as much as 10,000 shares.
At the opening an advance of 1i,4@1% took
place, much to the surprise of the general run of
operators, who were looking for a lower range on
account of Saturday's bank statement and weak
cables from London. A dtcrine soon followed and
the market ruled weak until late In the afternoon
â when a era! advance ensued. , The improve
ment was not maintained, and in the decline the
Industrials, internationals, Mar battan and West
ern Union scored losses of 14Â® I U, per cent.
The weakness was due to a belief that the Bank
of I. upland rate 01 discount will be advanced on
Thursday. and also to the big dry-goods failure in
l'hi.adelpnia and the increased activity on the
part of the bears. Subsequently the losses ' re
ported were regained and there whs some buying
in certain quarters on the belief of a bg sound
money victory In Maine. Toward the close the
entire list weakened.on selling lor both accounts
and the market left off barely steady. London
firms bought St. aul and sold Louisville and Nash
vlll-, but their operations were unimportant
Neither the reduction In the posted rates for sixty
days to $4 82 nor the weakness of silver had any
influence to speak of on the railway speculation.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111, Sept. 14.â Wheat prices
changed Irregularly within narrow limits this
morning, but traders were somewhat indifferent.
Only light business was transacted, outside orders
being more than usually scarce, while scalpers
were doing less than an ordinary business. The
world's shipments were quite heavy at 7, 320,0i0
bushels, that being a factor at the commencement
of the session, prices then declining slightly, bat
very soon afterward rallying on moderate pur
chases. Receipts in the Northwest were 105 cars,
against 1674 on the corresponding aay last year.
J.ast Monday was a ho. 1 Jay, no comparison bein^
therefore possible. Chicago teceived 197 cars, and
inspected out 30,000 bushels. Liverpool opening
cables were i^4d higher.
The amount on ocean passage Increased 1.200,
-000 bushels, ana the visible supply 1,107.000
bushels, two announcements which served to
weaken the market, but late cables quoting 1 iver
pool Va@ld higher, Berlin H/i@lS4. marks higher,
ana Antwerp I- 1 /" centimes higner, caused a quick
change in sentiment, an advance resulting.
Throughout the remainder of the day the market
was very erratic and operators were puzzled over
its action. Kxport clearances were light at 256 841
bushels. The Encash visible supply increased
403,500 bushels. Paris quoted unchanged prices
for il..ur and s@lo centimes decline on wheat at
the close of thai market. December wheat opened
from 596;gc to 59 y 2 c, advanced to 60i, 4 ifgitH>3 c,
closing ut 60V 8 -, i /4 c higher than Suturuay. Esti
mated receipts for to-morrow, 285 cars.
CORNâ May maintained the reputation for dull
ness it long ago achieved. Nevertheless there
was qulcÂ« a respectable degree of firm ness in the
tone. There was some talk of a settlement of
railroad rates west, which, if true, would tend to
cut down the receipts This contrinuted to the
strength of prices, but the l.gbt trade was not con
ducive to great appreciation in values. Receipts
were 467 cars, and 621,559 bushels were taken
from store. Liverpool caoles were firm. The
visible supply decreased 774.000 bushels, and the
amount on ocean passage 400,000 bushels. Ex
port clearances amounted to 282,875 bush Is.
May corn opened at 243/ B e, advanced to 24% c,
closing at 24*/ i.c, 3/ 8 c higher than Saturday. Ks
tiinau-d receipts fur to-morrow, 590 cars
OATSâ Were neitner more nor less active than
they nave recently been, and no incident or hap
pening appeared to make interesting toe market.
Sympathy with the other grains ruled the saua
tion. Receip:s were 356 cars, and 49.525 bushels
were withdrawn from store. The visible supply
increased 804.000 bushels. May oats closed ' Vs@
i/4c per bushel h gher. Estimated receipts for to
morrow, 500 cars. - <
FLAXâ Was easier. Cash, 64@S4VsC; Septem

67Vjc. Receipts were 19 3 cars-
PROVISIONSâ It was possible to characterize
the feeling in provisions this morning as easy, but
not much changH in quotations was noted. That
the feeling was less than steady was ascribed to a
Blight decline in prices In the hog market. Owing
to the str-n.:th occasionally shown by wheat prod
uct was enabled to rally later in the session. Jan
uary porK and lard closed 5c to 7VÂ»c higher and
January ribs 2^c higher.

The assessment against the stock of the Mer
chants' National Bank of Seattle has been canceled
under a ruling of Judge Langley, in the Superior
Court, and the county officers are restrained from
attempting to collect - It. The case. It entitled
Charles 11. Baker, as receiver, against the County
of Kings. From th* complaint it appears that the
Assessor added together the amount of the capital
stock at its par value, the amount of the nominal
surplus and undivided profit, making $227,000 in
all, and then deducted from that amount real es
tate valued at $111,400, leaving a balance of
$115,600. Following out this system of fixing
valuations the Assessor finally assessed the bank
for $69,360, against which the bank has been
fighting. The Board of Equalization upheld the
Bsessment on appeal, ana the bank thereupon
appealed to the Superior Court and won Its case.
L. P. Mathewti, a citizen of Nebraska, lias begun
suit against Philip Tlllinghast, as receiver of the
Columbia National Bank, to restrain him from
beginning any suit against the stockholders of the
increased capital stock of the Columbia National
iiaiik; also to require him to expunge the credit of
the city of Tacoma to the amount f $1 12,000. An
injunction has been granted by Judge Gilbert,
which hoids good until to-day (the 15th lnsU), on
the repreÂ«entatlon that the receiver was about to
declare a dividend, to the injury of the p.alntiff.
Lotice 5 the claim of the city of Tacoma, It is
alleged that it 1.1 not valid or legal as against the
banking association, which Is In no manner In
debted to the city, but that, on the contrary, the
city is Indebted to the. bank in the sum
of about $8000. . This claim involves the
history of â¢, the defalcation of G. W. Bo S s?s.
fo Â£ â¢erly Treasurer of the city of Tacoma,
who deposited in the bank unpaid warrants of said
city, supposedly, but which it was afterward dem
onstrated were worthies*, they 1 having actually
been paid. The bank shows a credit of $104,000
in â¢ * of the city, which- if expunged -.would
leave a balance of $800 In favor of the bank. . The

man- - Hel . en (Mom..) Independent furnishes
â¢ir?t >? a . r . Ucul , concerning . the failure of the
not L.?f, tlonal Bank of. Helena, and says it was
not wholly unexpected. Heavy withdrawals by
large depositors on the day preceding the suspen
sk-n drained the bank of cash, and its paper failed
to go through the clearing-house. This was gen
erally kuown, but a rumor was circulated that
A. J. Davis of Butte, one of the large owners In the
bank, haC agreed to come to the rescue of the in
stitution with sufficient cash to tide it over its
difficulties. Wi.en it was decided to close, on
recommendation of K. D. Edgertou. two of
the heaviest s:ockholders, S. T. Hauser, the
president, and A. J. Davis, were not present. The
draf:s on the hank from the East have been par
ticularly heavy, and tate banks that kept their
balances at the First National had been drawing
on their accounts sharply, as have o;her depos
itors who carried large accounts. Mr. Edgerton
thought that niter September 1 there would be a
slight cessation, but the contrary was the fact.
>ir. Edgerton sa s that he was not apprehensive
of any aerlous difficulty until the afternoon of the
day preceding the actual closing of the institution,
because he was in negotiation for funds which he
thought he would secure, and the^e would have
been sufficient to carry the bank through.
Had the bank opened it would have been
for only a short time, and there would have
been a run, and those earliest would practically
have become preferred creditors. The Indepen
dent says, concerning the deposits in ihe bank,
that State Treasurer Wright had $1*8.604 91 in the
concern when it c osed, but he Is secured by an In
demnity bond from the bank to the amount of
$600,000, which is signed as follows: S. T- Hauser,
$1:25.000: E. D. Edgerton, $75,000: C. K. Cole,
$50,000; James a. Talbot of Butte, $50000:
A. J. Davis of iiutte, $50,000; Henry Kline,
$50,000; John P. j.urphy, $'.'5,0. 0; E. \\\ Beat
tie, $25,000; John C. Curtain. $25,000; A. J.
Seilgnuin, $25 000; George F. Cope, $25,000; J. B.
Sauford. $25,000. Una of the heuviest depositors
is the Northern Pacitlc Railway, which, when the
bank closed, had a balance of nearly ?10t),i-00 to
its credit. A large sum had been withdrawn by
this company but two days previously. The City
1 reanurer had $25,000 of the city's funds in the
bank, but he Is a. so secured by an indemnity
bond. There was no county money in the institu
tion. Mr. tdaerton says that with proper and
Judicious hand. lnt; of the assets the bank will not
only pay depositors in full, but will also pay a
dividend to stockholders.

weeks ago with a petition which had been
filed in the Superior Court asking mat the
probate of will upon the estate of his first
wife, who died in 1879, be set aside, and
also the letters of administration. The
petitioner is Mrs. Josppbine M. Powell,
who claims she is a niece and heir-at-law,
and that she was never served with a legal
notice of the proceedings of 1879, and that
consequently the court never obtained
jurisdiction over her.
In her petition Mrs. Powell states that
the first Mrs. Twombly was a slave and
that she was living on Spofford alley in
early times, when Twombly married her.
C. H. Twombiy married the lady in
â¢whom there was some colored blood in
1862. Some years later she died, and the
capitalist married a sister of Dr. Barchard
of Oakland. In 1879 he applied for letters
of administration upon bis deceased wife's
estate, but neglected 10 have the matter
carried through, as he was advised that as
it was community property and that as
his wife had left him her share of the
property in her will, letters of administra
tion were unnecessary so long as the will
was admitted to probate, which it was.
Mr. Twombly defends the character of
his first wife ana denies that she was a
resident of Spofford alley, and says she
was a very worthy and good woman, given
to charitable acts.
At this afternoon's session of court the
case was submitted on briefs.
"I have been pursued ana hounded by a
gang of persons for seventeen years,"
said Mr. Twombly. "Only the other day
a leader in the gang came to me and de
manded money as the price of silence. I
told the oarty they could paint me black,
white and yellow, but so lone as there was
a" spark ot manhood left in me I would
never yield a dollar to a blackmailer. It
is true that I married a woman with some
dark blood in her veins many years ago.
I was told by Mr. Tallant, the banker, tbat
I took no chances in marrying the woman,
that he had known her for twenty years
and that she was a good woman. I respect
the memory of my rim wife. My enemies
say she was a slave. O:i that point I do not
know the fact.
"Since her death a gang of women and
men have been persecuting me for money,
and making threats that if I didnot yield
up my cash they would blacken my char
acter. It was unfortunate that I di,i not
complete the probating of my first wife's
will during these seventeen years, as they
now make insinuations that 1 robbed the
estate. This whole thing is a gigantic con
spiracy, and I propose to tight it.
"Only a few days ago my wife was coming
from the lawyer's office, when a big colored
man shook his fist in her face and threat
ened her if she testified against them. /*
â¢ "I am fighting thÂ» m now and will spend
all I have, if necessary, to show the whole
thing up, 1 have the honor of a dead
woman to protect and of a wife to pre
-BÂ©rvÂ© "
. Several years ago Mr. Twombiy had a
serious trouble to encounter. He was pur
sued by Maria Richardson, a widow, who
declared that Twombly was the father of
her child. The capitalist would not listen
to her, so ahe sued for $10,000 damages for
breach of promise. Attorney Delmas
secured a nonsuit for Twombly and since
then the capitalist had led a retired life.
Several colored men and women accom
panied Mrs. Josephine Powell to court
and all were interested spectators. Twom
bly denies that Mrs. Powell is a niece of
his first wife.
COUNTY TAX RATE.
Slightly Higher Than Last Tear, But
the State Rate Reduces the
Total.
The Board of Supervisors will meet
Monday next at 9 a. m. to fix the tax levy
for county purposes. Tfiis afternoon they
devoted to a general discussion of the
matter and agreed that the rate will be 54.1
cents inside of incorporated cities, and
with 33 cents added for road purposes. 87.1
cents on the outside. This, with the State
tax of 42.9 cents for State purposes, makes
a 97 cent rate in incorporated towns and
cities and $1 30 outside.
The rate last year was $1 18 inside and
$1 53 outside, with the State at 68.5 cents.
The rate this year is therefore a flight in
crease, owing to the fact that $30,t)00 had
to be raised for a new bridge over the
estuary in anticipation of the removal of
the present ones by order of the War De
partment, and about $30,000 for election
expenses, tnese both coming from the
general fund. Compared with last year's
rate the apportionment of the levy is as
follows:
1895. 1896.
General fund 275 .80
County Infirmary 04 .071
School 18 .17
Road 85 .33
Sta.e 685 .429
Total* $1.53 $1.30

SWORE WITH HIS HAT ON
Judge Frick Humors an 0:d Man
Who Has Many Matrimo
nial Troub'es.
Solcmon B:iimgarten Must Pay Ali
mony to His Young Wife and
Bib; or Go to Jail
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 14. j
Solomon Baumgarten appeared before
Judge Frick this morning on a citation
issued by Attorney ftlitchell to show cause
why alimony should not be paid on insti-
tuted divorce proceedings to defendant's
wife and child, who have, as shown by the
affidavits of Dr. Medros, Mr. Reimers,
Mrs. Prescott and others, been and are in
a starving and destitute condition. De
fendant was imprisoned some time ago
aud fined $100 in default, but after two
days he tired of jail and paid up. ."â¢-â ;â¢;.
Since then he has contributed nothing
whatsoever toward his wife and child.
Solomon learning that his wife intended
taking divorce proceedings against him
deeded all his property to his son Figl, by
a former marriage, and it is claimed that
he did so in order to defeat bis wife's
claim under a marriage agreement fora
substantial part of the old wan* estate,
which is estimated at $10,000 at least. Pro
ceedings are pending in Judge Ellsworth's
court to set aside the conveyance to de
fendant's son on the ground of fraud.
When Solomon appeared before Judge
Frick to-day he bore the appearance of a
severely wounded fighter. A large red
handkerchief was bound over his head to
hide the mark of i.is recent battle with his
arch enemy and father-in-law, Isaac Pan
tosk-y.
Wnen Baumgarten took the oath there
was a lively scene in court. The aged
husband of a very young wife took the
stand and was about to be sworn with his
hat off.
This did not please him, and placing his
hat on his nead he walked up to Judge
Frick and said that he preferred to be
sworn according to Hebrew fashion.
Judge Frick humored the ancient junk
dealer and Baumtrarten took the oath
with his hat on. lie admitted receiving
the rents of the premises, although the
property had been deeded to his son.
: When his Honor promptly ordered that
$20 per mouth should be paid to plaintiff
Solomon declared he had no money and
would not pay.
There Is one good trait about old Baum
erarten. Although money is dear, liberty <
is dearer. He defiantly refused to pay a
line of $100 in the Police Court and went
to serve one day for every $2. When he
had served $4 worth he weakened, paid
over $90 and came out.' It will probably
be the same in this case.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1896,
MINERS SEARCH
FOR AN OLD CAMP
Declare if Found It Will
Then Be Easy to Locate
the Ledge.
WORKING VERT QUIETLY
City Electrician Carleton Asked
to Aid the Prospectors With
His Recollections.
NEAE THE WILLIAMS EANCH.
Thirty Years Ago There Was a Boom
ing Mining Camp on the Place
They Now S^ek.
Oakland Officb San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 14. \
For several weeks two men have been
traveling over the hills back of Ban Pablo
trying to locate a gulch that was dug out
by gold-miners a generation ago.
The men, who are both well along in
years, went to George Carleton a few days
ago and asked for his help in locating the
scene of former activity. Carleton is city
electrician and is the best informed man
on the events of this county that can be
found within its borders.
Thirty years and more ago, when tbe
hills in the north of this county were
staked out in regular claims, sold was
found in small quantities in every direc
tion. Miners came from all directions and
a healthy camp grew like a mushroom on
the hillsides.
All efforts were concentrated in trying
to locate the ledge that it was thought
must exist and be responsible for the
many little finds that were daily reported.
The mother lode could not be found and
the camp disappeared even faster than it
had grown. Nothing more has been done
and for a generation the idea of getting
the precious metal in paying quantities
has been abandoned.
Xsow it is claimed that if the old lines of
the camp can be located the two men who
have been at work for weeks can find the
ledge, and they expect that it will prove a
rich one.
"When they called on me," aald Mr.
Carleton to-day, "they told me of their
hopes. They were young men when they
first worked on the hill so long ago, but
they have had a lot of experience since
then, and assured me that they can find
the ledge in a short time. The" old camp
was somewhere near the Williams ranch
and can be recoenized because the miners
cut a great gulch into the hill in search
for the lode.
â¢â¢My visitors did not tell me any of the
details upon which their hopes were based,
and did not even give me their names.
Tney were earnest fellows and, although I
cannot give them much encouragement,
they certainly believa in their own ability
to strike it rich. It will astonish most
people to hear that there was once a gold
fever in Oakland, but while it lasted it
was quite exciting. I went out there and
did some digging, but got nothing but ex
perience."
Several old miners have prospected on
the northern hills, and all have argued
that there is a led.-c hidden away in them.

Annual Gathering of the Woman
Suffragists' Society of the
University Town.
BERKELEY, Cal., Sept. 14.âThirty
three football men turned oat this after
noon for three-quarters of an hour's prac
tice on the field. This was the largest
number that have come uown from tne
"gym" for practice together at any one
time this season. Most of the aspirants
for honors on the gridiron were new men.
That is, they have never before played
under the blue and gold, but some of tnem
evidently have had considerable previous
experience with the pig-kin.
The players were divided into three
squads â one under Bender, another under
Hopper, and the third and largest squad
under Captain Ransome. The first two
squads spent the entire practice period in
running after and (ailing on the ball,
while Kansome's squad practiced catching
the great fullback a kicks. The ground
was in poor condition for practice, not
having been wet down sufficiently long.
Mii Iholes were in abundance. Half the
univeisity turned out to witness the first
big practice oi the season and to size up
the new material.

precinct is to be made between now and
election time. In nine of these precincts
chairmen have been chosen who wiil oall
regular weekly meetings for the discuss. on
of the cause, besides soliciting every voter
of the precinct for bis support in the at
tempt to pass the proposed eleventh

men have been named and are carrying on
the outlined work. Mrs. Mary Smitn is
in charge of the First Piecinct. Mrs. Flint
of the Second, Mis. Elinor Carlisle of the
Third, Mrs. JuJpe Goodcell of the Fourth,

SOME NEW METHODS.
Councilman Kaufman, Recently Ap
pointed, Telia How the Police De
partment Should Be Conducted.
OAKLAND. Sept. 14. â Councilman
George C. Kaufman, who was recently
appointed to that offico by the Mayor, has
been making some suggestions as to how
the Police Department could be run with
the present force and yet have five more
men for patrol duty. In speaking of the
subject he said:
"My idea i> to have an inclosed patrol
wagon, so that no one would be needed
besides the driver. Now there is a day
and a night man to accompany the patrol
to care for prisoners, when if covered they
could bo locked in. This is done in East
ern cities and works well.
"There are thirteen men about the City
Hallâ the Chief, two captains, three detec
tives, a sergeant, a bailiff, a subpena officer
and four officers. The Cnief could as wail
do the work of one captain in the daytime,
and the night captain could do his work
and that of the sergeant. In this way a
captain, a sergeant ana a detective could
wear a uniform and with the two from
the patrol wai'on make 67c men available
for patrol duty, and save the city $600 a
year."

Whereas, It is contended by certain inter
ested parties that all cities in the State of Cali
fornia not embraced within the sixth class are
prohibited by law from producing electricity
and selling the same to their citizens, such
prohibition being aliegei to exist by reason of
the fact mat the charter of no city except
cities of the sixth class specltlca.'ly grants sucn
power to municipal corporations; and whereas,

steps as will prevent the city of Alameda from
supplying the citizens with electric light;

DELAYING THE PROJECT
Effect of the Tidal Canal Con
troversy on the War
Department
Colonel SuterWill Exercise His Judg
ment Without Reference to Petty
Local Differences.
Oakland Office San Fbancisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Sept. 14, 1896. f
The document forwarded to the War
Department by the Alameda Board of
Trustees has caused considerable interest
in this city. Men who have worked for
the improvement of the harbor for years
deplore the position taken by Health
Officer McLean, and consider that since he
entered upon his campaign a year ago the
work has been seriously hurt, and prob
ably retarded.
"Colonel Suter is in charge of the work,"
said one oi the most interested parties to
day, "and it is not iikely that he will ac
cept our opinion or that of Dr. McLean of
Alameda. Colonel Suter is an experienced
engineer and will be guided by his judg
ment. He is not making a campaign to
retain his office, but is working on what
he considers the best and most practicable
lines.
"All thu tug-of-war business between
the twe cities cannot possibly result in
any good and is simply complicating mat
ters. Dr. McLean areues that the work
should be done his way, because of an old
report that has already been officially con
demned as being based on "imperfect in
formation." Colonel Suter and his prede
cessor, Colonel Mendell, agree that Dr.
McLean's ideas are not the best, but he
keeps sending his long communications to
Washington when there is not the slight
est hopo that they will meet with any at
tention.
"We have not forgotten the manner In
which A'ameda's Health Officer obtained
our signatures to a document that had a
joker in it, and which we were afterward
lorced to repudiate to avoid misrepresenta
tion. We are quite willing to leave every
thing to Colonel Suter, and the result will
be the same whether we do or not."

that the primary election officers selected
by Chairman Mautalen tor the Sixth Ward

James Groegan, inspector, and Ed Farre'J,
clerk. The first two are the thirty-fifth
and sixteenth names respectively on the
Democratic club roll in the Sixth Ward

ThÂ« question is, How do the men's names

Democratic club rolls?

UNLESS COURT ORDERS.
Mr. Goodfellow Will Not Pro
duce Any of Senator
Fair's Wills.
He Says He Never S'.w the Will of
the 21st in Which He Is
Made Trustee.
W. S. Goodfellow, one of the special
administrators of the Fair estate, and
named as one of the trustees under the
will of SeptemDer 21, gnve something of a
deposition before Notary Latham yester
day mornins in tne will litigation, but it
fell short of the purpose for which he was
summoned. He did not have any of
Senator Fair's wills about his person, and,
more than that, he declined to produce
any unless ordered to do so by the court.
That balked the proceedings, and Mr.
Goodlellow was allowed to depart until an
order of the court could be obtained re
quiring him to do so.
The inquiry was conducted by Mr. Del
mas in John E. Richards' office.
Mr. Goodfellow stated that his age was
45 and that he had been practicing law in
this City for twenty-one years. He was
Senator Fair's legal counsel for a number
of years before the Senator's death. The
very first work he did for him was to draw
up a codicil for a will and the very last
thing was to draw up a will. A large part
of the work he did for the Senator between
the first and the last was to draw up more
and more wills. One ol theÃe wills
drafted in 1893 was afterward modified by
other counsel out of the State, by whom it
was also signed and tiled. Tne witness
said it was very hard for him to keep the
run of all the wills and codicils, although
he drew them all â all excapt that winch
had been written out of the State and the
will of the 21stâ with the latter he had
nothing to uo. The wills were all filed
tiway in the late Senator's office; all in en
velopes sealed and numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and
so on.
He said he never saw the will of the
21st, that it was filed without his
having been consulted and was stolen be
fore he saw it.
"In your capacity as special adminis
trator you Dave charge of these wills, have
you not?" asked Mr. Delmaa.
"I presume they are in the vault in Sen
ator Fair's office. I would not be willing
to Dring them here without an order of
court. But the Question as to whetner
I should do so or not has not been
raised."
"Weil, then," said Delmas, "I will raise
it now. I make a formal demand that
you produce those wills."
"To bring the matter legally to an issue
I shall waive service of subpena aud shall
formally refuse to produce them," an
t-wered Goodfellow.
"Very well," said Delmas, "that will
bring the question before Judse Slack for
settlement. My conception of fhe law is
that it is the duty of any one having wills
of a deceased person in his possession to
turn tiiem into couit without regard to
wnat he may have heard as to wills of
later date."
"It may be a correct one, too. bat I do
not agree in it," said Goodfellow.
Tliis ended tlie proceedings of tbe morn
ing. Messrs. Lloyd ana Wheeler were
supposed to appear and give their deposi
tions in the afternoon, but after waiting
until nearly 3 o'clock word was received
that they could not be present, and the
hearing was adjourned.
An Accident, Not Suicide.
Coroner Hawkins has come to the conclusion
that James Bagley ol 327 Clementina street
did not come to his death through suicidal
intent. He was an oid man, who nad become
exhausted by walking and lay down on the
beach, wi.ere the tide reached his body. He
leaves a widow and three sons to mourn his
.oss.

p ano business, my old quarters on Market
st. are entirely too small: I have therefore moved
Into my own building, at 526 Haves at, between.
Octavla and Laguna, where I can now display
ever four times the amount of instruments than
formerly ; as I buy tor cash and In carload lota
and have no rent to pay I can offer any one desir-
ing a piano or organ better value for less money
than any other music house in San Francisco.

TYNAN'S BROTHER
ON THE ARREST
Believes There Must Be
Some Mistake in
Identity.
LATELY IN NEW YORK
Two Months Ago P. J. Tynan
Had No Intention ot Going
Abroad.
IRISH NATIONALISTS TALK.
Men Who Knew "No. i" Intimately
Believe It Is All a Scotland
Yard Plot
The news of the arrest of P. J. Tynan
came as a thunderbolt out of a clear sky
yesterday to the patriotic Irishmen in tins
City. They had not the faintest thought
JOHN T. TYNAN, a Well-Known Citizen of San Francisco, a
Brother of P. J. Tynan. The Latter, Known as "No. J,"
Was Arrested at Boulogne, France, on the Old Charge of
Being Concerned in the Lord Cavendish Murder in Phoenix
Park, Dublin, in JBB2. The Arrested Man's Brother and
His Friends in This Gty Discredit the Stories Spread by
the English Police Since His Capture*
of any movement, covert or otherwise,
against England, but instead they have
been asking the crown to pardon all the
Irish Fenian prisoners. "With this peti
tion uppermost in their minds the story
of an alleged dynamite plot, coupled with
the arrest of men who have been in the
background for years, appeared abso
lutely incredible. On one point they
agreed, ana that was that the whole
sensation was part of a well-conceived
scheme to manufacture public opinion
that would offset the scandals which they
claim are bound to come out in the Par
liamentary investigation into the treat
ment of Irish political prisoners in Brit
ish jails.
There are some prominent Irishmen in
San Francisco wno knew P. J. Tynan
quite intimately, and they are more
especially astonished at his arrest His
brother, John T. Tynan, who is an old
San Franciscan, said yesterday that he
could not believo that the man arrested
in France was his brother.
"It may be like a drowning man catch
ing at straws," he said, "but, then, I can't
believe that ray brother is in France.
There have b-en so many palpable lies in
the dispatches about him that I am rea
sonably led to believe there is a great mis
take. Why. it is only two months now
since I eot a letter from him. We were
in continual correspondence, and he never
mentioned a word about leaving the
United States. On the contrary, he often
told me it was his wish to live out his
days in this country and to die here. In
his last letter there was nothing even to
lead me to think he was going out of the
United States.
"In 1882 the English Under Secretary of
Foreign Affairs was sent to Washington
from London. He asked the United States
Government for recocnition of extradition
papers for my brother, but it was denied
him. There was nothing against him ;no
proof of his connection with any of these
cases.
"I notice that the dispatches say he

talked before a bar while drinking. That
is a lie. My brother has been a strictly
temperate man, in fact, a total abstainer,
for many years. He was not used to go
into saloons even, and as for talking so
that he could be overheard at a bar â that
is nonsense."
Colonel John O' Byrne knew Tynan in
timately in New York, and ia a "firm be
liever in his innocence.
"I've had professional connection with
those people likely to know if such a con
spiracy existed," he said. "Whereas the
Nationalist element of American citizens
of Irish birth have not gone back upon
tbeirviews of Irish nationality, jut there
is no such thing as a dynamite conspiracy
of any kind or character, nor has there
been any in existence for many years. It
may be said by our enemies that it exists
in either Chicago or New York, but the
Nationalists here are in such close touch
with those of Chicago or New York that
it is utterly impossible that such a con
spiracy could exist in either of these cities,
or any part of the United States, without
it coming to the knowledge of the people
here.
"It is evidently a scheme of some branch
of the British Government to save the
name of England from the atrocities prac
ticed upon the Irish Fenian prisoners.
Such men as Dr. Gallagher and John Daly,
and others of that stamp, were all men of
culture, and everything has been done in
the English prisons to brutalize them and
drive them mad. The English have
driven them insane, but were unable to
brutalize them.
"I loot forward with a good deal of in
terest to the expose on this subject, cer
tain to be made by means of the Parlia
mentary inquiry in the House of Com
mons, which Mr. Balfour has been com
pelled to grant as to the treatment of
Irish prisoners in English prisons.
,'lt was well known at the time of the
murder of Lord Edward Cavendish, which
was r cruel and cowardly one, that Tynan
had nothing whatsoever to do with it.
There is one of the men yet living who
was engaged in that murder, and who is
now serving a life sentence, and he has at
all times declared Tynan's entire inno
cence of any complicity in the crime. The
whole affair is a well-conceived and cor
rupt plan of Scotland Yard, actinir of
course under superior orders, to manufac
ture public opinion in such a way as will
lead to the justification of t: c barbarous
treatment of Irish political prisoners.
"Tynan was openly a resident of New
York. He was to be seen day after day
on Broadway for many years, and it was
well known to British detectives, who fol
lowed him constantly. He was never in
San Francisco, but it was no secret that
he lived in New York for years."
"The Irish people, as 1 know them," de
clared Thomas Desmond, the well-known
Irish nationalist, "would not be crazy
enough to take any action while those
poor fellows are in jail and begging the
English Governmtnt to release them. A
great many Irish nationalists are under
the impression that he had nothing to do
with the Phoenix Park murders. My
honest conviction is he never had any con
nection with them. Sometimes people
ory 'mad dog' and everybody takes a
kick at the animal as he goes along. I
don't believe in dynamite, but open war
fare, facing the enemy on the open field,
and I believe ninety-nine per cent of the
Irish people feel as I do.
"Wiien I met Tynan it was during the
Blame campaign in Boston, in August,
1884. He was always perfectly sober, and
conhned himself to 'soft' 'drinks â lemon
ade and soda water â and I never saw him
taste liquor. My opinion is that if he was
over there in Europe the English would
arrest him and make a fuss over it to keep
him in jail."
SOCIALISTS ARE FREE.
Judge Conlan DUmiaiiei the Cases on
Motion of Attorney Haskell.
The cases against the five Socialists,
Charles D. Sunflower, T. F. Burns, A.
Delaroche, Manuel Bottana and Leon
Brown, who were arrested on August 29 at
Seventh and Market streets for obstruct
ing the street, were dismissed by Judge
Conlan yesterday.
Attorney Haskell, when the cases were
called, moved for a dismissal on two
grounds. He said the complaints were
defective, and from the fact that two dif
ferent juries, who had been instructed to
bring in a verdict of guilty, had failed to
agree it was evident that it would be use
less to try the caaes again before another
jury.
The prosecution coincided with Attorney
Haskell and the Judge accordingly dis
missed the cases.

tioner appointed by the Department at Wash

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 1896.
MOORE JUMPED
TO HIS DEATH
Leaped From the Upper
Deck of the Steamer
Bay City.
HIS BODY RECOVERED.
Took the Plunge as the Ferry-
Boat Was Steaming by
Goat Island.
VAIN IFFORTS TO REVIVE HIM
"I Have Taken Mv Last Drink of
Whisky" Was His Cry as He
Sprang Overboard.
J. E. Moore, for years a special police
man employed at the Baldwin Hotel,
committed suicide at 7:20 o'clock last
evening by plunging into the bay from the
deck of the ferry-boat Bay City.
Moore boarded the steamer at tne narrow
gauge mole on the Oakland side at 7
o'clock. He was apperantly sober, and
behaved in a rational manner. After
strolling about the vessel for a few
moments, he walked inside the cabin and
took a seat.
When the boat was opposite Goat Island
Moore rose from his seat, rushed to the
rail, threw his hat on the decs and shout
ing, "I have taken my last drink of
whisky," spraue overboard.
Captain John Leale, who witnessed the
act, immediately signaled the engines to
stop the steamer, and promptly ordered a
boat to be lowered. After a short search
Moore's body was found floating in the
wake of the steamer.
The body was taken into the boat and
thence hoisted aboard the steamer. Here
it was rolled over a barrel, and a physi
cian, who chanced to be aboard, was sum
moned, but when he came unon the scene
the last spark of life had departed.
On arriving at this side Captain Leale
notified the Coroner, and the body was re
moved to the Morgue. Here it was no
ticed that the man's ear was split, and it
was first supposed that death was the re
sult of a fracture of the sk ull, but an in
vestigation showed that it waa undoubt
edly due to drowning.
In the hat that Moore threw upon the
deck was found a letter addressed to the
deceased, at 187 Hyde street. The super
scription was written in bold characters,
apparently the handwriting of a man.
Inquiry at 187 Hyde street elicited the
information that J. Moore was a special
officer employed at the Baldwin Hotel for
the past ten years, but who was dis
charged a few months ago. He bad been
recently emp.oyed at the New Louvre.
He bad been drinking heavily lor some
time past and often expressed his inten
tion of committing suicide.
He left home last night about 7 o'clock,
saying that he intended to end his life, as
he was tired of the way he was living.
His wife left home about 5 o'clock to at
tend a supper at a friend's house, and was
unaware that her hu-band had committed
suicide. They had been married ten
years, but had no children. Moore waa an
absinthe- drinker.
FEEDING UPON GARBAGE
Sad Plight in Which Young
Francisco Fernandez Was
Discovered.
The Lad's Body Bears Marks of Vio
lence Inflicted, He Says, by
His Mother.
Officer W. T. Hooper of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ob
served a little boy eating some refuse from
a barrel in front of a fruit cannery, on
Francisco street, yesterday, as though
famished with hunger. Mr. Hooper asked
him what he was doing there and why he
was eating such disgusting food.
The lad, in answer, told a most pitiful
story. Hit name, he said, was Francisco
Fernandez, and until ten days ago he bad
been living with his mother at 4 Gerke
alley. According to the boy's statement,
his mother has been extremely cruel, beat
ing him with coal-scuttles, brooms, tea
kettles, hot pokers and other instruments
of torture whenever she took the notion,
which, he says, was pretty often.
Ten days aeo Francisco left his forlorn
abode and betook himself to a burrow
under the sidewalk on Francisco street,
whence he would occasionally emerge in
order to satisfy the cravings of i unger by
regaling himself on the apple cores, rotten
peaches and other garbage cast forth from
the cannery referred to. Whenever he
saw a police officer he would dodge be
neath the sidewalk or crawl into a barrel,
and had Mr. Hooper been in uniform
would doubtless have endeavored to .get
away from him.
The boy's body is in a frightful con
dition, bis left leg and side being a mask
of sores. His hands are scarred and burned,
he avers, by repeated contact with the hot
poker, which seems to have been a favorite
means of correction.
The lad was taken to the Connty
Hospital for treatment, and will be kept
there until cured. He is 10 years old, but
looks younger. His father died some years
ago. The case is now under investigation
by the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.
BORAX BEDS OF INYO.
One Hundred Acre* of Vats Goingâ Lively
Politics and Need of a Railroad
and (.anal.
Among the arrivals at the Licit House is
W. M. Richards of Inyo County, who has
been agent for the Carson and Colorado
Railroad for over seven years at Keeler
and Independence. He has resigned to
engage in mining in Nevada County,
where his father, Captain Henry Richards,
has been prominently connected with the
mines for nearly forty years.
Mr. Richards is enjoying his visit to San
Francisco, after his seven years' work on
the desert.
He is an enthusiastic bicyclist, and in
tends making a tour of the mining coun
ties of the State on his electric bicycle
this month.
Mr. Richards says Inyo County needs
more and better railroad facilities, and
some good irrigation canals.
"The railroad should be extended from
Keeler through the Panamint and Death
Valley mining section, and connect it
either Barstow or Mojave," he said. "Th
lead and silver mines are the mainstay of
Inyo, at present, but there are only three
or four mines working, where sixteen or
eighteen were formerly worked.
"If the San Francisco and Ban Joaquin |
Valley Railroad Company ever extends
from Bakersfield through Walkers Pass
it will benefit Inyo County greatly, and
will have only a gap of sixty miles be
tween the two railroads.
"Inyo County is the third largest county
in the State, its area being 10.156 square
miles. There are 1014 voters registered in
Inyo County thisyear. They need protec
tion for their wool and soda, and the ques
tion is, How can they get it? Freight
charges are high to Inyo County points
from San Francisco and Sacramento, rang
ing from 2% to 2% cents per pound."
He says that the production of soda
from the beds of Inyo amounts to 3000
tons a year. Over 100 acres of vats are
now in use. The plant is being extended
every year. The crude soda is shipped to
San Francisco and Alameda to Smith's
borax works, and the price ranges from
$22 to $30 a ton. A. J. Laws, the superin
tendent of the Inyo Development Com
pany, which is operating the beds, has
twelve white men and thirty Chinese at
work.
ILLEGAL FISHING.
Six Men Arrested for Using Small HÂ«ih
Nets.
Deputy Fish Commissioners John H.
and W. J. Davis, now patrolling the upper
bay in the launch Hustler, made two im
portant arrests early yesterday morning.
They made a run along Suisun Bay, and
below Roe Island found two men fishing
for bass with small mesh nets. The depu
ties started for Suisun with their prisoners,
and a iew miles further down the bay they
captured four more fishermen engaged in
the same illegal business, and when cap
tured had caught a number of striped bass
in tneir small mesn nets.
The six prisoners were taken to the town
of Suisun, and not being able to secure
$250 oail each went to jail.
DENIES THE WOMAN YARN
Millionaire Campbell Says He
Did Not Go to Meet
Any Girl.
The Winthrop Trial A'most Over.
Assumed Names by Which the
Prisoner Was Known.
The trial of Oliver W. Wintbrop is fast
drawing to a close. Yesterday the last
testimony of the defense was introduced
and the prosecution's evidence in rebuttal
was commenced. To-day or to-morrow
the arguments of counsel will probably be
heard and then the fate of the prisoner
will be in the hands of the jury.
Yesterday after John Forbel, James W.
Burling, J. M. Custer and Adolph Meyer
had told what they know of Winthrop's
character and general reputation, which
all agreed was >:ood up to the time of the
Matthews episode, the prosecution began
the introduction ol evidence in rebuttal.
A. M. Pierson, assistant superintendent
of Laurel Hill Cemetery, was called, and
asked whether E. J. M. Stanley owned a
lot there. Attorney Bell objected to the
question and a wrangle ensued, but Bell
subsequently withdrew the objection.
Pierson replied that the books do not
show that E. J. M. Stanley owns a lot,
but that one S. L. Stanley has a plat,
Cecil Brown, who has been Mr. Camp
bell's business agent for some time, said
that for a number of years his employer
did not carry a purse, but that recently he
has done so. He identified the purse
found on Winttirop as being in every
respect like the one Campbell has carried.
Mrs. Abbott Campbell, wife of the prose
cuting witness, also said the purse is
exactly like her husband's.
James Campbell himself was then re
called. He denied in toto Winthrop's
story about the veiled woman at 4109
California street, and said that Wintbrop
never rang the bell but opened tne door
with a key wnich he carried. Campbell
also denied making any arrangement
with Winthrop, or anyone else, to rent
the California-street cottage for him.
"Did you arrange for that house to meet
a woman there?" asked Judge Wallace.
"I did not," replied the witness.
Mrs. Dunton, from whom the cottage
was rented, denied Winthrop's story that
Urquhart rented the cottage. She said
she never saw Urquhart until she gazed
on him in the courtroom. She positively
identified Winthrop as the man to whom
she let her house.
"How is it you are better able to iden
tify Him now than you were when you
saw him in prison after his arrest?" asked
his Honor.
â¢'One reason," replied Mrs. Dunton. "is
that then I only gave him a glance. Now
I have heard him speak. His pronuncia
tion is peculiar. For instance he says
'aettin' ' instead of 'sitting.' "
"Then you consider yourself better able
to identify him now?" asked Lawyer
Bell.
"Yes; I identify him positively. There
can be no mistake," replied the witness-
In answer to a question Mrs. Dunton
said no one had tried to influence her tes
timony, and ancle dthat no one had better
attempt such a thing.
Attorney Bell earlier in the day made a
determined attempt to impeach the testi
mony of D. A. Urquhart. He tried to
prove that the witness had been convicted
of a felony. On Saturday afternoon a
record of an arrest and two years' im
prisonment in a Canadian prison was
introduced, but Urquhart denied having
ever been in Canada. He, however,
admitted having been twice arrested on
charges of felony, on which he had not
been convicted.
District Attorney Barnes then went into
Winthrop's army record. S. R. Taylor, a
United States quartermaster, told of how
he enlisted in Company B of the Tenth
Infantry in 1870. He said he then met
Winthrop, whom he knew as Standinger,
and served several years with him. He
said that it was after re-enlistingthat the
prisoner took the name of Winthrop.
Calkins was another name whicn Taylor
said Winthrop bore atone time. An inci
dent concerning a missing coat, which
was found in Winthrop's possession, was
also retailed, but was objected to ami not
admitted in evidence. On cross-examina
tion Taylor said that In 1870 Winthrop's
age was about 19, and that he did
not know him by that name until 1878,
when they met at Whipple barracks in
Arizona. Afterward they met in this
City in 1886.
Court was then adjourned nntil this
morning at 10 o'clock, in order that Mrs.
S. L. Stanley mieht come from Ukiah to
testify aa to the Tot in Laurel Hill Ceme
tery.
LAKE MERCED TUNNEL
A. K. Buckman, the Contractor, Com-
pletes a Difficult and Dangerous
l'iece of Work.
One of the most difficult pieces of en
gineering work ever undertaken in the
State has just been completed in the con
struction of the great Lake Merced tunnel
by A. E. Buckman, the well-known con
tractor, for the Spring Valley Water Com
pany, which required just seventeen
months of labor â botn night and dayâ to
complete. Owing to the many difficulties
encountered in eddies of subterranean
water it was impossible to complete the
work sooner.
The pressure of water upon the tunnel
compelled the system of shafts and up
per drift to be sunk and the engineering
difficulties met wi'h were embarrast-ine.
The work, however, was vigorously
pushed ahead by Mr. Buckman, who is,
indeed, to be congratulated on the satis
factory completion of *uch a diffic ult and
dangerous undertaking. Mr. Herman
Schussler, chief engineer of the Spring
Valley Water Company, directed the en
gineering part of tue contract.

now in the care of those who will see that
his environment gives him a chance for
mental and physical development.
At 2:30 a. m. Sunday Patrolman Kern
was strolling down Sanchez street, when
his attention was directed to a buggy in
Buckman's oamp by a slight noise pro
ceeding therefrom. An investigation dis
closed the fact that in the box a little
fellow was curled up asleep.
On beinff awakened he pitifully begged
the officer not to harm him. He was
speedily reassured on thiÂ« point, and was
immediately taken to the Seventeenth
and Howard streets station. When they
arrived there Lieutenant Burke got the
little waif to tell his story. He cannot
speak English very well, but managed to
make himself understood.
His name was given as Alberto Conscio
and his age as 10 years. He said he came
from Peru and with great tears welling up
in his eyes said he had no parents. They
had been dead as long as he could remem
ber. The only thing he knew was that
about three years ago some one brought
him to California and placed him in the
care of P. Bacigalupi, living at 24 Dolan
street.
They gave him very little to eat, the
outcast said, and made him sleep at night
on the cold kitchen floor. In addition, he
complained that he was at times cruelly
mistreated.
"Three days ago," continued the child,
"I came to the conclusion that 1 would
stand a better chance by myself and ran
away. I have wandered around nearly
everywhere and most of the time have
been without anything to eat.
"Once or twice some of the men at Buck
man's camp gave me something to eat when
I came around. Last niirht I crawled into
the buggy to sleep. Then that soldier
there found me and brought me here."
"Of all the sorry sights I ever saw in
all my life," said Lieutenant Burke, "it
was that poor, friendless, little outcast.
His clothes were nearly rags, in many
places the nude body showing through the
rents antl patches. His hair bad not been
shorn for months and was tangled and
matted in a way to set a currycomb at
defiance.
The T&es he wore were infested with
vermin, and directly above the instep of
the right foot was a blister as large as a.y
hand.
"We feared it would frighten the child
to put him into a cell and found an old
comforter in which to wraD him and let
him sleep in the station. In the morning
we had to put the comforter in tne ash.
barrel."
Yesterday the child was taken to the
Youth's Directory, where he will be prop
erly cared for. Father Crowiey kindly
placed him in his old garments yesterday
to give The Call artist an idea of his ap
pearance before bis bath and haircut.
Nobody was home at the Bacigalupi
mansion on Dolan street yesterday, but a
small son whom his companion denoini

nated "Pete" was playing ballon the side
walk.
"What you want to know who the kid is
for?" he inquired, looking keenly into the
face of the interrogator.
"Oh, you've got him at the Youth's Di
rectory, have you? Well, all I know about
him is that his parents died in Lima,
Peru, six years ago. A man broueht this
guy up here to a cousin, who wouldn't
have him, and the man gave him to us.
"He's no good. Want's to dress like a
'swell,' and run away. We had some one
hunting for him, and if we found him we
was agoin' to send him to a school iv San
Rafael."
SWALLOW D POISON
Mrs. Â£11 Hazel, 830 Geary Street, Died
at the Beceivlng Hospital.
Mrs. Eli Hazel, 830 Geary street, died at
the Receiving Hospital yesterday after
noon irom supposed poisoning, but the
nature of the drug will not be Known till
an autopsy is held at the Morgue.
Her husband is employed by A. L. Ban
croft Â«fc Co., 324 Post street. H - got to the
hospital a few minutes before she died.
He could assign no reason for his wife
committing suicide.
"I left her this morning." he said, "and
she seemed as happy as possible. She has
been drinking heavily, and last night I
thought she was on the verge of delirium
tretuens; but she appeared to be ail right
this morning. I cannot believe that she
took poison.
Hazel and his wife had rooms at 830
Geary street. About 2 o'clock yesterday
afternoon another lady roomer discovered
Mrs. Hazel in an unconscious condition.
She notified the landlord and he sent for
Dr. Sus^man. After examining her, the
doctor thought she was sufferinsr from
chloroform or laudanum poisoning and
ordered that she should be sent to the
hospital. The patrol-wagon was sum
moned, but when she was placed on the
operating table it was evident that she
, could not live many minutes.
OFFERS TO GIVE A FARM.
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst's Generosity
to the Presbyterian
Orphanage.
All the Money Already Collected
Will Now Be Devoted to
Building.
Great satisfaction was expressed yester
day at the meeting of the San Francisco
Presbyterian Orphanage and Farm, at
a letter from Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst, offer
ing to donate a tract of land at San An
sel mo to be used as the orphanage farm.
For some months past the directors
have been trying to raise money to buy a
property at San Rafael, and it is only
owing to a legal technicality that the first
installment of money has not yet been
paid. The price of this land is considered
to have been very high, and to raise funds
to purchase it would have hampered the
building projects of the directors for some
time to come. Mrs. Hearst's offer t: ere
fore was joyfully accepted. A committee
to confer with Mrs. Hearst was apoointed
consisting of the president, Mrs. P. D.
Browne; the secretary, Mrs. W. MacÃae;
the treasurer, Mrs. W. B. Noble; and the
chairman of the advisory committee, Dr.
Noble of San Rafael. It will be the object
of the committee to complete arrange
ments for accepting Mrs. Hearst's kind
offer as soon as possible, as building will
be commenced when the transfer of the
property is completed.
In view of acquiring a farm for nothing
it was resolved that all money donated or
hereafter donated to the orphanage
shall be put into buildings.
The first annual report of the Presbyte
rian Orphanage and Farm was issued yes
terday. It shows that the institution has
done extensive work during the first year
of its existence, although it had little or no
capital to start upon.
The annual donation party of the or
phanage will take place on the 24th at San
Rafael. Clothing for boys and grls under
14 years of age is particularly desired
The donation party will be preceded by a
basket luncheon at Mrs. A. Â£. Kent's in
San Rafael.
HoCoppin Claims the Credit.
The new streetcar mail service was formally
inaugurated yesterday. There was some slight
fear on the part of Superintendent Flint that
everything would not run smoothly, but the
results showed that these fears Were un
founded. True, there was a slight hitch iv the
Sacramento-street line, but that was due to an
unavoidable accident in the Dower-house of
the Market-street Railroad Company The
schedule, as published in The Call of Sunday
ETn C f a ,h rl^ OUt , Â»Â° Pertly as to create the
belief that in a few days a more rapid schedule
may with safety be inaugurated. Postmaster
Mf-Coppin said yesterday it was through his
efforts entirely that the new service was estab
lished. He began work on it. he said, as early
as October, 1895, and by continuous hammer
ing inJuced the department to authorize the
innovation. Mr. McOppin further said he
had had three independent powers to combat,
namely, the Postmaster-GentTiil, Harbor Com
missioners and the Market-street Railway
Company. How successfully he fought the
three lorces is seen in the estiiblishm-'i t of tue
most perfect city mail system in America.
Suicide of a Young Girl.
Mary MeNamara, while temporarily Insane,
committed suicide ai her home, 2424 Bryant
avenue, yesterday morning by swallowing
carbolic acid. About 8 o'clock in the morning
Mrs. McKlana, with whom she has been living
for some time, visited the girl's room and
found her unconscious. On a table was a vial
labeled "carbolic acid," showing plainly the
cause of the piri's illness. Half an hour after
Mrs. McKlana arrived the young woman died.
Miss MeNamara has recentl been confined in
a private asylum, but was released some
weeks ago. It is thought that she committed
the rash act wtiile suffering from the original
cause which led to her first incarceration.
The dead girl's mother lives in VacÂ»ville.
