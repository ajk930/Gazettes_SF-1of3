ENSENADA, Lowee California, Oct.
14. â The steamer Orizaba, Captain yon
Helms, arrived at this port tbis afternoon
from the southern coast a day late. It
was delayed at Mazatlan waiting bul
lion and treasure from tbe San Jose de
Gracia, San Dimas and other mines,
which generally ship by way of Altata.
The Orizaba brings a few particulars of the
terrible calamity that visited Altata and
the neighboring ccast on September 17
and 18.
On the morning of the 17th the wind
storm of the Gulf of California, known as
the "Cordonazo de San Francisco," began
to blow. It increased rapidly in force
during the day and tremendous down
pours of rain accompanied the wind.
Back in the mountains the rain fell in tor
rents, in some places assuming the shape
of a cloudburst. On the coast the wind
had reached the violence of a hurricane by
nightfall.
All night long the storm continued,
and, after a slight cessation the next
morning, began again, sweeping the coast
with fearful intensity until midnight of
the 18th, while every creek and river in
the region overflowed its banks and
wrought havoc.
The Orizaba brings the crew of the
American schooner Rebecca, which was
wrecked at Redos Island, near Altata.
Tiie Mexican schooner Cometa, owned by
Pablo Hidalgo, was wrecked at Altata and
is a total loss. Captain Gordiviola and two
sailors were drowned and the rtst were
saved by boats from the Rebecca. The
schooner Elena, owned by the Altata Rail
road Company, was broken into halves.
The great storm swept back from the
coast at Altata, destroying the town of
Altata, leaving only the jail and the
Aranzubia buildings. The custom-house
safe, containing $18,000 in silver, was re
covered. The number of lives lost cannot
be ascertained, but it is very large. Where
the town stood is now a channel with six
fathoms of water.
The town of Elota is a complete wreck,
and nineteen lives were lost. Quila and
Tecullo villages were swept away. Eight
bodies have been recovered. The railroad
between Altata and Culiacan is washed
out so that communication is shut off be
tween the capital and the coast.

Turkish Capital as a
Dispatch- Boat
President Cleveland Denies That
a Warlike Demonstration
Is in Prospect.
MAY INVITE AN OPEN INSULT.
This Government Determined to Col
lect Damages for the Recent
Outrages.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 14.â The
little dispatch-boat Bancroft of the United
States navy, now about due at Smyrna,
has not been ordered to force the passage
through the Dardanelles with or without
foreign aid. This can be stated on the
direct authority of the President of the
United States.
There is no doubt that the Bancroft is
going to Constantinople just as fa-t as her
steam can carry her, or just as soon as
Minister Terrell makes a request upon
Admiral Selfridge for her services a? a
guardbuat or dispatch-boat in the same
capacity as similar light-draught and
light-armored dispatch-boats are placed at
the service of other friendly nations.
This fact was stated with explicit details
in the United Associated Presses' dispatch
from this city on the morning of August
28 last.
The Bancroft left Gibraltar in company
with the Cincinnati a week a?o last Sun
day and should have reached Smyrna and
probably did reach that point yesterday,
steaming at the rate of 200 miles per day.
If the Navy Department has been advised
of the arrival at Smyrna it has seen fit to
withhold the information. The Bancroft
assuredly started for Constantinople.
Orders were given to the proper bureau
chiefs of the Navy Department to fit her
for guard duty in the Golden Horn, and
she was so equipped in August and Sep
tember under urgent ten-day orders from
Assistant Secretary of the Navy McAdoo.
There is abundant information to tbe
effect that this Government intends to
collect the Harpoot, Marash and other in
demnities before Congress meets. Na

tional insult may be invited as a method
of last resort â the Corlnto incident be
tween Great Britain and Nicaragua being
adopted as a precedent â in which event
Admiral Selfrldge might seize the customs
of Smyrna until the proper amount is col
lected, and in the opinion of some promi
nent naval officers here the admiral will
employ his fleet for that purpose unless
apologies and indemnity are soon forth
coming.
Undoubtedly the signatory powers of
the treaty of Paris have been informed
of the purpose of the United Statr .
and have given their consent. Under
such circumstances the Porte must of
necessity acquiesce.
In tbis connection it may be stated that
no confirmation has been received either
from Minister Terrell or from any other
source of the alleged unofficial declaration
of the Turkish Government that it would
permit no more guardships to enter the
Bospborus, and considering that nearly
ten days have elapsed since this statement
was first cabled "via sofia" its authen
ticity is gravely doubted.
The United States is bound to have
some answer from Turkey in regard to the
destruction of American missions in Har
poot and Marash before the next Presi
detial message goes to Congress.
For some time past the necessity of hav
ing a guardship at Minister Terrell's dis
posal has been a subject of earnest dis
cussion In the Cabinet and frequent con
sultations had been held between the
Secretary of Btate, the Secretary of the
Navy and the President, at which the
views of Minister Terrell, who was ex
ceedingly anxious that a man-of-war be
longing to our Government should be in
Turkish waters pending tbe long dis
turbed condition of affairs in Turkey, was
made thoroughly understood and more
than a year ago a decision in accordance
-With Minister Terrell's wishes in that
direction was readied and all details of
the important service were carefully and
advisedly considered. After the declina
tion of Turkey, in January last, to allow a
naval vessel to pass the Bospborus Min
ister Terrell promised that if the Bancroft
should be sent he would find a way to get
her in. ____________

THREE ROBBERS
BITE THE DUST
Tragic Sequel to a Bank
Raid at Meeker,
Colorado.
The Bandits Obtain About $1000,
but Fail to Get Away
With It.
HOT FIGHT WITH CITIZENS.
Three of the Latter Woundedâ Over
a Hundred Shots Fired During
the Battle.
MEEKER, Colo., Oct. 14.â One of the
most desperate battles was fought on the I
streets of this town to-day between the
men who robbed the Bank of Meeker and
the citizens, and to-night three robbers
lie on cooling-boards in the morgue and
three citizens are found to have been
wounded by the thieves before the Jatter
bit the dust. The dead are: George Har
ris, Charles Jones and William Smith.
Without doubt it is the most daring
crime in the history of this section of the
country, which for a long time has been
the center of storms, of Indian wars and
exciting events, and the battle of to-day
is the most remarkable.
The robbers entered the town from the
north, mounted, and proceeded to the
bank without any attempt at concealment
of themselves. The bank is located in a
general store, one of the largest of the
trading houses in this section of the coun
try. They stepped qnickly into the room,
two of them remaining in the center of it
wnile one of them approached the bank
window, where the cashier was engaged
in conversation with a depositor, and
brushing the latter aside thrust a revolver
in his face.
The man dodged, and the sound of a
pistol shot caused the cashier to raise his
hands. Then the two men in the center
of tbÂ» store commanded everybody to hold
up ti r hands or die. Nobody wanted to
Cashier Moulton then opened the doors
of the safe at the point of the revolver,
and the contents of the strong box were
removed, after which tbe robbers took all
! the firearms in the possession of the men
in the store and left by a rear door, where
they had hitched their horses.
But the robbers had miscalculated. They
forgot the kind of stuff the people of
Meeker are made of, and as they stepped
through the door it was to find that the
building had been surrounded by the
townspeople, who were aroused by the
shots, and the alternative of surrendering
or fighting it out was presented to them.
They raised their revolvers and com
menced to fire immediately. Then com
menced one of the most desperate of bat
tles. Bullets cut the air, penetrated the
buildings and hailed through the crowd.
It is a wonder that more men were not
killed. But the robbers were surrounded;
they had fired the first shot and had to
accept the consequences of their folly.
The first shot ot fhe fusillade was fired
at Deputy Sheriff William Clark. The
bank officers and those in the store broke
for cover. Guns were distributed among
them, and the roboers, finding themselves
alone, opened fire, shooting at everybody
in sight. The people of the town com
menced their work, and in less time than
it takes to tell it about 100 shots were fired
and three men fell to the ground.
The robbers fell defiant and firing Two
of them died in an instant, their skulls
split, their hearts and their bodies pene
trated by rifle balls. One of the men, who
gave his name as Harris, lived for an hour
and gave the names of his pals as stated
above. The names are undoubtedly as
sumed, but the man who gave his name
as Harris died with the secret of their
i identity, loyal to the last to his partners
in crime.
Jones and Harris were literally riddled
with bullets, and that Harris lived so long
is remarkable. There were perhaps 100
men in the vicinity of the place at the
time, but the wounds received were slight.
The robbers managed to empty their re
volvers, putting up one of the gamest
fights ever recorded in criminal annals.
The money, less than $1000, was recov
ered. The men were not known. They
were never seen in these parts before.
Smith was about 20, and the others about
30. They were magnificent specimens of
physical manhood. Where they came
from, and what they were previous to
coming, is a mystery. Charles Jones, the
leader, was a typical specimen of a
rough frontiersman, and, from his make
up, just the sort of a man who would em
bark in such a daring exploit. The
robbery was well planned. The men,
by their actions, showed themselves to be
old hands at the business, and they would
have escaped with ihe money which they
secured had it not beeh for the fact that
they fired the first shot in the bank, thus
giving the alarm which resulted in their
being cornered and shot to death.
Several men were wounded, but so
slightly as not to be of consequence.

SALT LAKE, UTAH, Oct. 14.â 1t ap
pears that the holding up of the westbound
Union Pacific train No. 3at Uintah, eight
miles east of Ogden at 3:15 o'clock this
morning was the work of one man, single
handed and alone, who by a clever coup
cajoled the passengers and trainmen into
the belief that he had ample assistance in
the raid that he was making.
The outlaw first made h\% appearance
by climbing over the tender into the cab
of the engine, peremptorily demanding
the fireman and engineer to throw up
their hands, saying that he was about to
rob the train. The robber was disguised
in such a way as to prevent any possibility
of identification, having bis head closed
in a sack, with eye holes cut. The men
immediately complied with the request
of the robber and were forced to disguise
themselves as he directed, he furnishing
them with flour sacks to pull over their
heads. Over their mask they were re
quired to pull down their bats in a man
ner that would indicate to the passengers
and others that they, too, were robbers.
At this point he compelled the now cap
tive engineer and fireman to uncouple the
train, leaving the express and mail car at
tached to the engine. After this was done
he personally mounted the engine, leaving
the engineer and fireman upon the ground,
pulled the throttle and ran part of the
train half a mile down the canyon, where
he stopped and began his efforts to blow
open the safe.
The express messenger and mail clerk
in the meantime remained in their respect
ive cars. The robber commanded Express
Messenger McCoy to maintain absolute
silence, an injunction which he unwill
ingly but implicitly obeyed. After tbi3
the desperado spent an industrious but
fruitless thirty minutes in an attempt to
bore into and blow open the safe with dy
namite. During the operations of the rob*
ber the express messenger sat quietly on
a box near by.
After failing to reach the inside of the
safe, and seeing that success in that direc
tion was impossible, he abandoned his
work and turned his attention to the mail
car. He commanded the clerk to throw
out the registered packages, and four mail
bags were accordingly thrown out. Tak
ing out his knife he proceeded to cue open
the bags and rifle them of such matter aa
suited his fancy. He secured a number
of registered packages, but as to the ex
act number and how much money they
contained there is no means of knowing at
this time. At this point the robDer fin
ished his business and escaped. The di
rection which he took from this point ia
not known.
The passengers were not molested but
were badly frightened, and being led to
believe that the track on each side was
lined with robbers ready to shoot at the
first head that appeared, they kept very
quiet during the hour the bold robber was
getting in his work.
The four mail pouches overhauled wera
through pouches. Three of them were
destined for ban Francisco and came one
from Chicago, one from Omana and the
other from Hartford, Conn. The fonrth
was from Chicago, going through to Sac
ramento. The bandit threw aside the
large packages likely to contain merchan
dise and carried off an armful of the
smaller ones. He also took the receipts,
which makes it more difficult to deter
mine what package* are gone.
The only clew to the identity of the rob.
ber is tne fact that a stranger was noticed
in the neighborhood yesterday riding a
horse and leading two others. He re*
mained around during the day and even*
ing and acted in a suspicious manner. It
is claimed that he showed great expert*
ness in handling a train, with which he
seemed familiar.
To-night it was found that a package
containing $i 5,000 in greenbacks for
Wells, Farco & Co.'s bank in San Fran
cisco was overlooked by the robber, who
got hold of it, tore the end open and
turew it to one side without examining it
sufficiently to become aware of the nature
of its contents.

In Welcoming Them the Major
Makes a Very Happy
Address.
TALKS TO STREET- CAR MEN
Big Delegation Arrives in the Even
ing From Cumberland, Ml ,
With Torches and Music.
CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 14.â Twelve car
loads of gleeful Republicans from Mc-
Donald, Washington County, Pa., came
to Canton on a special train at noon to
day. They march* d ut> to Major McKin
ley's residence and were the first of the
callers this week to be received at bis
home. When the Pennsylvania people
were within 300 leet of the McKinley resi-
dence the Barnum Circus parade swung
around the corner and proceeded down
Market street, bringing the delegation to a
forced halt. Major McKinley, who was on
the porch to receive the delegation, saw
the parade and Mrs. McKinley joined
him. Earlier In the day a committee
representing the circus attaches presented
Major McKinley with a handsome silk
flag. The spokesman for the Pennsylvania
delegation was C. A. Whiteshot. He as
sured Major McKinley that not only were
there many commercial producers among i
his visitors, but that the miners, farmers
and business men were well represented.
Major McKinley responded at some
length. \^
A delegation in which much interest
centered, and to which the major made i
the most interesting speech of the day, was
one which came quietly without flying
banners or beating drums. It was com
posed of nearly 300 members of the Early
Settlers' Society of Cleveland and Cuya
ho?a County. There were many old peo
ple in the delegation, and there was a
touch of pathos in the spectacle they made
when they marched slowly up with their
white locks and halting footsteps. Major
McKinley's venerable mother was at her
son's residence, and assisted in the recep
tion of the visitors, most of whom were of
her day and generation. H. M. Addison
introduced the old p'ople to Major Mc-
Kinley, and Rev. Lathrop Cooley, chap
lain of the society, supplemented his ad
dress with some remarks. Major McKin
ley spoke as follows:
I am highly honored to receive this call from
the old folks of Cuyahoga County and of the
city of Cleveland. I am glad to welcome to
my home the early settlers of Northern Ohio.
1 welcome you not as partisans, but as good
men and women who bring me your wise coun
sel and good, will and your congratulations.
1 thank you for myself and on behalf of my
wife and mother to whom you have so tenderly
referred, and to whom, more than myself, I
am indebted for this generous and agreeable
call. It is a proud pleasure to me to be able
to credit to them whatever good things my
fellow-countrymen ascribe to me. To wife
and mother mankind is indebted for those
bigh moral qualitiesâ gentleness, truth and
virtueâ which are so indispensable to good
citizenship and a noble life. Our political
fabric rests upon the sanctity of the American
home, where wife and mother preside. They
teach the boys and girls purity of life and
thought and aim the way to usefulness and
distinction. The world owes them more than
it can ever repay. The man who loves mother
und wife requires no bond ior his good be
havior and can be safely trusted in every rela
tion of lue. [Great applause.]
It id gratifying to me to see that the men
who have passed through bo many political
campaigns, who have fought so many political
battles, who have reached their three score
years ana ten, give mo their confidence and
the strength of their supportâ no, not I, but
the cause and the principles which I have
been designated to represent in this contest.
'â Young men for war and old men for counsel"
was wisely spoken, but I have discovered that
in this political contest the old men get young
again and manifest quite as much animation
and vigor as the boys themselves, [Laughter
and applause.]
You have doubtlessly participated in many
Presidential elections and can witness this
year that earnest enthusiasm which you ex
hibited years ago in the forties and the fifties,
and in that mighty crisis of 1860. Do not
forget that the son is like the father, and be
charitable to him II he gets too enthusiastic
and participates in more parades, processions
and meetings than you would have him.
Senator Hoar of Massachusetts, returning
from a visit to Europe, was a guest on last
Saturday at the Massachusetts Club .in the
city of Boston. He was given a warm, gene
rous and royal welcome, such as he deserved.
The Senator had passed the milestone that
marked his seventieth year. He said in reply
to the greeting, among other things:
"To an old man who counts his three score
years and ten the chief satisfaction of life is
not wealth or power or fame or office. It is
friendship."
An English poet and essayist, George Crovv
lcy, wrote with his own hand, at the age of 80,
an epitaph, which can be found In the Church
of St. Stevens, Walbrook, London. What Sena
tor Hoar said seemed to him summed up better
than could be found anywhere else the bless
ings which this life has to confer. This was
the epitaph:
"Thankful to Almighty God for the past
blessings of life, health prolonged to old age,
a competence, a not Inactive mind, a loved
and loving wife, kind friends and excellent
children."
I trust these blessings have all been vouch
safed to you, early settlers of Cuyahoga
County.
At 3 o'clock several hundred employes
of tbe Cleveland Street Railroad Company
called on Major McKinley. They wore
neat uniforms of white and marched ex
ceedingly well. Their spokesman was a
conductor, Thomas Martin. Major Mc-
Kinley was applauded when be stepped
forward to speak. He told the men he
was glad to observe their keen interest in
public affairs, and said two questions
would be settled by the election this year.
First, whether we are to continue the pro
tective policy under which the country
was so prosperous ; second, whether or not
we are to have a sound, stable and honest
currency.
Tbe last delegation arrived after sunset
and came from Cumberland, Md. They
marched up to McKiuley's residence with
torches and a band. The spokesman,
George W. Snyder, referred to the com
posite character of the delegation and to
the fact that Major McKinley was sta
tioned in Cumberland during the war.
Major McKinley said:
I congratulate you upon the splendid vic
tory achieved in your State last year. It is a
long time since I addressed a Republican meet
ing in the city of Cumberland. When I spoke
to you then passion and hate characterized the
poetical contest. Fortunately the passion and
prejudice which then prevailed has disap
peared, and those who were then divided are
now together fighting the battle of honest
money and the public honor. You come from
a country distinguished for its rich coal-min
ing, iron, steel, glass and cement products, a
railroad center and a city that ought to enjoy
great material prosperity. Your State has
wrested from the Democratic party its old-time
majority and registered a splendid Republican
victory. I give you hospitable greeting. Let
there De a repetition this year of the great vic
tory so decisively and honorably won last
year. Give us, men ol Allegheny County, in
1896, the same cause for congratulation, and
not only will Maryland have reason to rejoice,
but all the States will immediately or even
tually approve your verdict.
The prosperity of the United States for a
long time to come, and certainly its honor, is
involved in the pending campaign. Elim
inating ah minor issues, it Is a contest for the
preservation of law and order and the inde
pendence, dignity and integrity of the Federal
judiciary. What will the answer of Maryland
be to that open challenge? It is for the con
tinuance of honest moneyâ gold, silver and
paper, all equal to the best and everywhere as
good as the bestâ and the restoration of the
protective tariff system, without which we
cannot hope to have either permanent pros
pwity among our people or sufficient revenue
to support the Government.
Mrs. McKinley, with a party of friends,
occupied a box in the Barnum & Bailey
Circus this evening. Major McKinley re
mained at home working on his speeches.
Engagements for visiting delegations are
still being freely made. Ten new dele
gations were booked to-day. Among
them was the Boston Herald's pilgrimage
of the sound-money men of New England.

from a speechmaking visit to Illinois
towns. He addressed a meeting in the
suburb of Austin to-night, and to-morrow
goes to Indiana. He speaks Friday at
Bittus and Saturday at Dunkirk. Then

Arrangements have been made by tbe
Republican National League for State
demonstrations to be held in San Fran
cisco, Portland, Or., Omaha and Detroit.
Those California clubs which cannot par
ticipate in the San Francisco demonstra
tion will have local celebrations on the
same day. Similar demonstrations are
being arranged by the league in other
cities to close the campaign.
Tarns Bix^y, chairman of the Minnesota
Republican executive committee, came to
headquarters to secure all the speakers
available for his State. He was given In
gersoli to start with and hopes for others.
He admitted the party has a bard fight to
win against the forces of silver.
Chairman Hanna said he was greatly
pleased at the increased registration and
took it to indicate a big Republican nia
i'ority in Cook County. Committeeman
'ayne said it meant that over 300,000
votes would be cast in the county, of
which 200,000 would be for McKinley.
A party of Cincinnati citizens, headed
by Mayor Caldwell, called at headquarters
on their return from Milwaukee. Mayor
Caidwell told Mr. Hanna be was surprised
to find so much Republican sentiment in
Wisconsin. He said Cincinnati would
eive 20,000 majority for McKinley and
Hamilton County over 30,000.
Charles Frohman, the theatrical mana
ger, was a visitor. He said he had been
here three days and bad heard three times
as much McKinley talk as be had heard in
Xew York, and from tbe reports he bad
received from bis companies about the
country he was confident of McKinley's
i election.

NEW YORK, N. V. ( Oct. 14.â This was
a quiet morning at Republican headquar
ters and there were not half a dozen call

mittee regard the fight in New York State
as over and look \ upon ; McKinley's elec
tion as sure. The story that Bryan money
went begging at odds of 4 to 1 yesterday
in the Stock Exchange and that no Mc-

given much credence at headquarters. The

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1896.
BRYAN TALKS TO
THE WOLVERINES
Rides Four Hundred Miles
and Makes a Dczm
Speeches.
His Remarks Intended for the
Benefit cf the Mining
People.
IN A REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD
But the Audiences Were of Good Size
and Considerable Enthusiasm
Was Displayed.
MARQUETTE, Mich., Oct. 14.â The
lines of a crooked walking-stick with a
flange at the end of the crook resemble in
shape the route taken by W. J. Bryan to
day in his progress through the upper
peninsula of Michigan. His course lay
partly along a region interesting in its
desolation, past miles and miles of forests
laid bare by Inmbermen, by fire and by
storm, and through towns and hamlets
supported by the iron and coal interests of
the section. From the time he left Duluth
late last night until he reached Marquette
the candidate traveled 400 miles, and at
10 o'clock he left Marquette for another
all-night run to Mackinaw City, *here his
second day of campaigning in the Wol
verine State will begin. Between the com
mencement of his speechmaking in Iron
wood, early in the morning, until he called
.a halt on the day's work at Marquette Mr.
Bryan made a dozen addresses. He talked
principally for the benefit of the mining
people.
His route lay directly across the spper
peninsula in a direction east by south
from Lake Superior to Lake Michigan,
touching the borders of Wisconsin ; swung
around to the northwest, forming the
crook of the walking-stick, and then shot
off to the east, thus making the flange,
touching Lake Superior again at Mar
quette.
In the ea/ly part of the journey cheers
for McKinley were heard at a few of the
stopping places, and at one of these Mr.
Bryan made reference to the shouts of his
opponents. Miners dressed iv their soiled
working clothes, their caps adorned with
lamps and candles, were plentiful along
the way. Speeches were made at Iron
wood, Bessemer, Watersmeet, Iron River,
Florence, Wis. ; Iron Mountain, Norway,
Powers, Escanaba, Ishpenning, Negaunee
and Marquette, and there were stops at a
few other smaller places to enable the
people gathered at these to see the candi
date and his wife.
The region traversed is the strongest in
the State in allegiance to the Republican
party, and the itinerary provided for a
thorough canvass of it by Mr. Bryan.
His audiences were of good size and some
of them showed considerable enthusiasm.
The half hour spent by Mr. Bryan at
Iron Mountain had an additional interest
to both candidate and audience from the
met that Marcus A. Hanna has mining
interests in the vicinity and is a large
shipper of ore from that place. A large
number of miners in their working clothes,
with candles projecting from their char
acteristic headgear, lined the railroad
track as the train drew into the station.
Around the stand erected for Mr. Bryan's
accommodation, a few feet from where the
train came to a standstill, 1500 people had
assembled, and Mr. Bryan wa* cheered as
be ascended the stand with Mrs. Bryan, D.
G. Campau, Justin R. Whiting and Timo
thy Tarsney. Mr. Hanna's association
with the little city brought no direct ref
erence from Mr. Bryan. '
At 2:30 the Bryan special reached Nor
way, a mining town, fifteen minutes' run
from Iron Mountain. The Scandinavian
type was sufficiently numerous among the
five or six hundred men and women there
to indicate bow the place received its
name. In a short speech from the rear
platform of the train Mr. Bryan made
reference to those who have tried to
destroy labor organizations similar to that
made at Iron Mountain.
The people of Powers, 400 of them, heard
the candidate deliver a brief speech.
The throng that bad assembled at
Escanaba, another of Mr. Hanna's ship- i
ping ports, was so large that tbe Bryan
special was held there twenty-five minutes
in order to give the candidate time to
make an address, the scheduled stop being
a quarter of an hour. Fully 5000 peonle
were gathered in an open field near the
railway station when the train arrived at
4:15 and they pioved to be one of the most
enthusiastic audiences of the day.
The atmosphere of the morning and
afternoon changed from warm to raw, and
Mr. Bryan kept his hat on and the collar
of his overcoat turned up about his ears
during the time be remained on the
speakers' stand. In his speech he told a
number of humorous stories and kept the
crowd laughing at these and at his refer
ences to the attitude of his opponents.
Mr. Bryan t?poke at Marquette for an
hour to-night to an audience of about 6000
people, assembled in front of the railway
depot. James Russell introduced him.
Mr. Bryan said that the people might well
be interested in this campaign, because in
no campaign known to the younger men
of this country had such great interest
been at stake. Continuing, he said:
Our opponents tell us that the success of our
cause would mean great danger to this coun
try. We reply to them that twenty years of
experience in their cause has been of Incal
culable harm to our country. They tell us
that the free coinage of silver will brinir
trouble; we tell them that the gold standard
has brought trouble. We place the experiences
of our people against the prophecies which
they make. They tell us that the free coinage
of sliver may not be free from dangers, that it
may not be a perfect system. We teil them all
we have to do is to offer something better than
they have had, and it does not take a very
great system to be better than the one we
have bad. [Great cheering.]
In one sense our campaign is a defensive
one; in another sense it is an aggressive cam
paign. It Is defensive in that we are defend
ing our homes and our firesides from an enemy
as dangerous as ever attacked the welfare of
the people. It is an aggressive warfare In that
we demand affirmative legislation; it is ag
gressive in that we are after something and
know what we are after and how we are going
to get it.
Mr. Biyan criticized the Republican
party for failing to say what they wanted,
and merely opposing everything that was
offered. Mr. Bryan also spoke of the fact
that contracts were being made payable
in gold, and asked where the gold was
coming from with which to settle these
contracts.
At 10 o'clock the Bryan special left for
Mackinaw City.
FLOWER SPEAKS IN INDIANA.
Jfew tork't Bx.Gavernor Pleads for the
â Defeat of Bryan.
ANDERSON, Ind., Oct. 14.âEx-Gover
nor Flower of New York opened his West
ern canvass with a speech in this city to
night. All of his remarks were directed
to financial questions and a plea for Dem
ocrats to "down Bryan and un-Domo
cratic principles." Governor Flower will
be in Indiana the rest of the week and
will then go into other Western States.
He will not return until November 1. He
places McKinley's majority in New York
at $200,000. He met John P. Irish of Cali
fornia here. Mr. Irish says McKinley
will carry California, Oregon, Washing
ton, lowa, Nebraska and Wyoming west
of the Mississippi.

and the Holy Land.
FRESHMEN WHIP SOPHOMORES.
Serious Battle at the University of Wis
consin, in Which Many Students
Are Badly Injured.
MADISON, Wis., Oct. 14. â A serious
battle occurred to-day between the sopho
more and freshman classes of the State
University at the close of the class meet
ing of freshmen at 5 o'clock this evening.
As the latter class came out of the gym
nasium, wnere the meeting was held, they
were Bet upon by the sophomores and a
severe struggle ensued. Many were se
verely pounded and had most of their
clothes torn from them. Several who had
rushed from practice in the gymnasium,
clad only in jersey suites, had them com
pletely torn from their bodies, out they
kept up the struggle. President Adams
and a number of professors, besides the
upper class students and citizens were
witnesses of the affray. The trouble
lasted nearly an hour and was only sup
pressed by the arrival of the police, who
were telephoned for. Several of the sopho
mores were ducked in Lake Mendota by
the victorious freshmen. Rev. A. J.
Kempton of the Baptist church, who was
a spectator, was caught in the crowd and
roughly handled. The affair caused great
excitement.
LOTH TO LOSE ROSEBERY
England's National Liberal Fed
eration Deplores Its Leader's
Withdrawal.
Labouchere Says the Federation Is
Extinct as a Factor in tbe
Liberal Party.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 14.â The executive
committe*of the National Liberal Federa
tion met at 2:45 o'clock this afternoon and
spent the time up to 6:30 o'clock in dis
cussing the situation. Tbe committee has
issued a statement expressing profound
regret at Lord Rosebery's withdrawal
from the leadership of the Liberal party
and making public recognition of his
lordship's signal services as Prime Min
ister and leader under circumstances of
unusual difficulty. The committee in its
statement recognizes also the fact that
Lord Rosebery's action in resigning was
due to a desire on his part to promote
unity in the Liberal ranks and rejoices
now that the party will continue to benefit
by tbe late leader's character, ability and
enthusiasm.
The social reform committee has de
cided, in view of the public feeling touch
ing personal questions, not to call a meet
ing of the federation at present.
Henry Labouchere, editor of Truth, in
an article in that journal voicing the sen
timents of the Radical members cf the
House of Commons and the supporters of
Sir William Harcourt, writes:
"Nobody cares a brass farthing what the
National Liberal Federation may say or
do on any subject. The federation is ex
tinct as a factor in the Liberal party."

DETAILS OF THE ENGAGEMENT.
The Rebels Surprised and Compelled
to Retire Without Carrying
Off Their Dead.
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 14.â The corre
spondent in Cuba of a London news
agency reports the result of the recent
fighting at Cascorro, in the eastern district
of Puerto Principe, Cuba, between the
Spanish forces, under General Castellanos,
and the insurgents, as a decisive victory
for the Government troops. Five thou
sand rebels, voder the leadership of
Gomez, the correspondent says, were
obliged to raise the siege of Cascorro, losing
300 men, killed or wounded. The Spanish
loss was fifty-five men.
MADRID", Spain, Oct. 14.â A special to
the Imparcial from Havana says another
engagement has been fought between the
insurgents and Spanish troops at Cas
coiro, Camaguey, which place was r?Â»Â»
cently besieged for thirteen days by the
rebels. In ibis battle the force of General
Castellanos, the Spanish leader, was com
pelled to retreat. The loss of the rebels is
estimated at 200.
HAVANA, Cuba, Oct. 14.â Official re
ports received here state that the Pizarro
regiment surprised a party of rebels under
Juan Delgado at Coca, in the Havana
province, and by a brilliant bayonet charge
routp.d the insurgents completely, com
pelling them to retire in such baste that
they were unable to carry off their dead.
The bodies of twenty-two rebels were
left on the field, and many of their men
were wounded. The Spaniards captured
a quantity of medicines and other stores,
which the insurgents were forced to leave
behind them. The loss of the Govern
ment troops was one captain and eight
privates wounded.
Further details of the fight between
General Castellanos' command and the
rebels are to tbe effect that after the Des
mayo engagement General Castellanos
started on the march to San Miguel. The
troops were engaged in several skirmishes
with the rebels during the march.
On October 9 the Spaniards marched into
Ellsaga, where General Castellanos ordered
a number of barges which were lying at
that place to transport the troops to Nue
v!tas. The soldiers were embarked upon
the barges, which were then taken in tow
by the gunboat Golondrina, arriving in
Nuevitas the same day. The sick and
wounded Spaniards were placed in the
hospitals and the troops rested until the
11th, when they took trains for Minas.
BANDITS LOOT A TOWN.
Terrorize the Residents at an Early Hour
in the Morning, Fire Duildings and
Make Their Escape.
NASHVILLE, Tenw., Oct 14. -The lit
tie town of Peryear, in Henry County,
near the Kentucky border, had a very
unpleasant experience early this morning.
The residents were aroused from their
peaceful slambers at 4 o'clock by the noise
of firearms discharged in the street. Those
who hurried out to find out what was the
cause of the shooting hurried back again
even more quickly, for they found that
the town was in the possession of a gang
of robbers, eight in number and all
masked.
The robbers kept up an almost incessant
firing, and whenever one of the citizens
Bhowed himself he was ordered to return
indoors and not show himself again under
pain of death.
Tbe desperadoes, after sufficiently in
timidating the citizens with a show of
force, proceeded to plunder the stores
that took their fancy. They then set lire
to several buildings and fled to the
country.
The citizens at once sallied forth and
after subduing the fires, which amounted
to but little, a posse of armed and de
termined men gathered and started in
pursuit of the robbers. Tbe chase is such
a close one that there is little chance of
the robbers getting away.
The amount the robbers stole is not vet
definitely known. It is believed that they
got away with at least $3000 in money, and
in addition to that they took considerable
property of other character when they
looted the stores.

LEADVILLE, Colo., Oct. 14.â Governor
Mclntyre left for Lead ville to-night. He
said before leaving: "A committee from
tbe Miners' Union asked me if I would

FOUL MURDER OF POLICEMEN.
Two Officers Shot to Death by Father and
Sonâ A Third Fatally Wounded in
Effecting Their Capture.
COLUMBUB, Ga., Oct. 14.â About 2:30
o'clock this afternoon, J. A. White, a
shoemaker, and Henry White, hi 3 son,
foully murdered two policemen on Thir
teenth street, in this city, and lataliy
wounded another, on Sixteenth street,
shortly afterward.
There was no cause for the commission
of the crime other than the fact tbat both
men had been summoned to appear before
the Recorder to-morrow for some trivial
offense.
By the time the third policeman had
fallen a crowd of over 500 armed men had
reached the scene and the murderer's
house was surrounded.
Tom Jackson, Marshal of Girard, and
Zeno Pickett, an ex-policeman of this city,
volunteered to. run White out of his house.
Four other brave men offered to follow
them and the crowd charged on the house,
firing hundreds of bullets into the win
dows and doors. When the fusillade
ceased Jackson and Pickett forced open
the door, whereupon White began firing
upon them.
The two men rushed in upon him, and
after shooting him a half dozen times
dragged him into the air. Immediately
after del J vering White's body to the
crowd Pickett fell to thesidewalfc%om the
effects of what is believed to be a fatal
wound. There is a faint hope for his re
covery.
TYPOS ON PIKES PEAK.
Hold a Session and Adopt Reso
lutions on the Sum
mit
Misbaps of the Tripâ Dined at tbe
Printers' Homeâ Struggle for
the Offices.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Oct. 14.â
The members of the International Typo
graphical Union went to the summit of
Pikes Peak over the cog road as the guests
of tbe local union. A session was held on
the summit, 14,000 feet high, and resolu
tions adopted thanking the citizens for
their courtesy. Some of tbe delegates had
an exciting experience, as an engine on
one of the cars blew out a cylinder and
tbe car started down the track. It was
quickly checked, but a number had to
walk down, as the car was disabled. They
were then further delayed by a streetcar
accident.
At 6 o'clock the members were enter
tained at a dinner by the superintendent
of the Printers' Home at the home build
ing.
A session was held this evening at which
nominations were made for tbe officers to
b.e elected to-morrow. Two sets of candi
dates are nominated, and a struggle will
be made for the offices. A committee of
three was appointed to draft resolutions
asking tbe chairmen of the National po
litical parties to use tneir influence in
straightening out all "rat" offices in the
country.
An attempt was made at the meeting on
Pikes Peak to introduce resolutions for
free coinage, but were suppressed because
of a law of the union forbidding the intro
duction of politics.
ARRESTED FOR ARSON.
Blue Island Tiremen Charged With Fir-
ing a Business Block.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 14.â Four men are
under arrest in Chicago charged with the
burning of the principal business block in
the town of Blue Island a short time ago.
The names of tbe men under arrest are:
Eruil Polsen, captain of the Blue Island
Fire Department; George Ducheane,
volunteer fireman ; Tony Maddy, volunteer
fireman; Fred Vogt, volunteer fireman.
On May 17 the town of Blue Island was
threatened by fire and tbe damage done
was over $100,000. The police have b^en
working on the theory that the fire was
incendiary and a few days ago arrested
George Duchesne. It is claimed now that
Duche sne has made a confession and it is
upon his statement that the others were
arrested.
There has been an effort on foot in Blue
Island for a long time to get a paid fire de
partment. Duchesne claims that several
fires were started by the volunteer fire
men to impress upon the residents the
necessity for a paid department. No at
tention was paid to the demand and the
big fire was planned. This is the btory of
Duchesne.
yntional Bank Suspends.
ROCKFORD, 111., Oct. 14. -The Second
National Bank, the oldest financial insti
tution of the city, will not open its doors
to-morrow morning, having gone into
voluntary liquidation. The result is due
to a steady shrinkage of deposits since
July 1. The clearing-house, which met to
night, states that depositors will be paid in
fuil and the bank will ultimately reor
ganize.
DR. BAMILTON RESIGNS.

and Surgeon- Genera I Wyman,
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 14.â Dr. John B.
Hamilton, the surgeon-general of the
United States Marine Hospital, stationed

PACIFIC GROVE MOURNS.
Funeral of Frank Oyer, the Victim of
Tuesday Night's Disaster on
Toro Grade.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal.. Oct. 14.â Frank
Oyer, the lad who was killed Monday
night in the carriage accident on the Sa
linas road, was buried to-day at 2 o'clock
from the picturesque Episcopal church of
St. Mary's-by-the-Sea. Long before the
appointed hour friends gathered at the
church and with sympathetic hands made
it beautiful with quantities of flowers. The
bier upon which the coffin rested during
the service was a simple but beautiful
bank of white roses and ferns.
At 1:30 ihe pupils of the Pacific Grove
High School and the highest grade from
the Monterey Grammar School, attended
by the principal, Mr. Hickman, assembled
at the school building and marched to the
beat of a muffled drum to the home of Mr.
Oyer, father of the dead boy, and from
there tcted as escort of honor to their
comrade's remains. At the head of this
cniumn of school boys and girls walked
the color-bearer, carrying the High School
colors draped in black. At the church
door the corpse was met by the Rev. Mr.
Fackenthal, rector of St. Mary's-by-the-
Sea, according to tbe church ritual, with
the solemn words, "I am the resurrection
and the life."
The service was impressive and deeply
affecting. When the funeral cortege left
the church for El Carmelio Cemetery the
line formed was the largest even known
in Pacific Grove. At its head rode the
Salinas football eleven, against which the
Pacific Grove boys had played on Monday.
Then came school pupils on wagonettes!
accompanied by their teachers, led by
Professor Sandwick, the principal of the
High School, and Charles Rosendale, who
coached the local football eleven just pre
vious to its match with the Salinas eleven.
He is a post graduate oi Stanford Uni
versity. Next rode the honorary pall
bearers, the remaining nine of the football
team, the tenth, James Mori, being too ill
to attend.
The active service was performed by
other boy friends of the deceased, as the
members of the team had not sufficiently
recovered from their injuries to act. Rev.
Mr. Fackenthal and the family followed,
and after them a long line of private car
riages containing relatives and friends.
The business houses of Pacific Grove
were closed during the hours of the
funeral services. The Bank of Monterey,
of which the father of the unfortunate
youth is a stockholder and director, was
also closed and draped. The floral tributes
were many and elegant. Among the
handsomest was a natural-sized broken
wheel of blue and white violets, sent by
the Salinas High School.

VICTIMIZE A DRUMMER,
Montana Bunko Men Pick Up a
Tenderfoot From Sleepy
Philadelphia.
Tbe Stranger Dragged and Tben
Robbed of His Simplo Case of
J welry.
PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 14. â Leopold
Adler, representing Philadelphia jewelry
manufacturers, arrived in Portland last
night minus his sample case, containing
$7000 worth of jewelry. He departed on
to-day's train for Livingston, Mont.,
where he hopes to recover at least a por
tion of his missing valuables.
Adler is not more than 26 years old, and
this is his first irip to the "wild and
woolly" West. A few hours before the
train on which he was a passenger reached
.Livingston two well appearing young men
engaged him in conversation, which finally
wound up in a friendly game of, whist.
While the play was progressing a third
genteel-looking" fellow invited the party to
join him in a bottle of wine. The invita
tion was accepted, and not only one bottle
but three were emptied before the trio re
turned to tbe game.
Before the end of tbe second deal Adler
was sound asleep, and he awoke only after
the train had left Livingston several miles
behind it. His three social friends had left
the train at that point. Adier paid no
attention to his valuable sample-case until
the train rolled into the Union depot at
Portland. He then found all his other
packages of baggage, but the most valu
able one was missing, and in it was $7000
worth of diamonds and jewelry.
The young drummer, quickly realizing
that his friends on the cars had drugegd
and robbed him, having by some means
ascertained he was a jewelry drummer
with a valuable stock in his possession,
wired to the Sheriff at Livingston a de
scription of the confederates. He received
a reply later to return at once to identify
his men, who are notorious bunko sharp
ers in that locality and within reach of the
authorities.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1896.
DIED IN A SAN
EMIDIO CANYON
Corpse of a Lone Traveler
Found on a Desert
Tract.
Proved to Be That of Edwin 0.
Hahn, a San Francisco
Attorney.
HAD SUCCUMB3D TO THIRST.
Effects Found Near the Body Leave
No Doubt as to Its
Identity.
BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Oct. 14.â The
remains of a man, believed to be Edwin O,
Hahn, a young attorney of San Francisco,
were found on Saturday morning, about
sixty miles west of here, in a canyon of
the desert foothills of the San Emidio
Mountains and near a wagon road leading
from Bakersfiela to San Luis Obispo. A
French sheepherder made the discovery.
The information was received by Coroner
Helm of this place Sunday evening. The
EDWIN O. HAHN, the Young Attorney, of San Francisco, "Whose
Corpse Has Been Found in a Canyon of the San Emidio Range.
next morning he sent Jean Pool as his
depnty to hold an inquest, and it was not
until this afternoon that Pool returned.
Pool says the body was located in a
lonely canyon, in a country nothing mora
than a desert. There was neither in
nabitant, timber nor water within miles
of it. The body was lying' on its face,
close to the road, apparently where it had
fallen. Every indication tends to prove
that the man had perished for the want of
water and food, for there were no marks
on the body to show that death had re
sulted from violence from either beast or
man.
The body was coatless, and besJde it lay
a hand-satchel and a memorandum-book.
Light trousers,! a black shirt and black
felt hat constituted the main portion of
the clothing. The hair was brown and the
beard, apparently of a week's growth, was
of a reddish cast. The satchel contained
papers and several business cards of law
yers and real-estate men, all showing con
nection with San Francisco and that the
man had resided in that city. Among the
cards were a number unused, bearing the
following:
EDWIN O. HAHN,
Attorney and Counse'.lor-st-Law,
â¢ 522 Montgomery street, Rooms 1 and 2. â 
This name appeared on the front of the
scratch-book, which contained many notes
regarding lands, etc. Many of them were
in shorthand. The book and entries are
just such as an ordinary attorney might
carry into court with him and in which he
would jot down casual notes.
Among the entries was one showing the
name of "Dan A. McColgan, attorney-at
law, 22 Montgomery street," and another
"Henry L. Horn, notary, corner of Wash
ington and Battery streets."
In the satchel was also a steamship
ticket from San Francisco to Port Harford
and return. The ticket bore the date of
October 2. It showed that it had been
used by him or some one else to ride to
Port Harford.
it appeared that death had resulted
something like two days before the
body was found. The man was about 28
years of age, and the body indicated that
it had been that of a man who did not toil.
It was buried near where it was found.
The unfortunate man was evidently
coming toward Bakersfield when over
come.
UNDOUBTEDLY BAHN'S BODY.
The Unfortunate Man* Relative* Are
Left No Ray of Hope.
There is no doubt but what the body of
the unfortunate young man found in a
San Emidio canyon was that of Edwin
Otto Hahn, the rising young lawyer of
this City. He resided with his parents at
2737 California street, and occupied an
office with Bernard McKenney at 522
Montgomery street.
Carl O. Hahn, his father, who is a
furnishing-goods dealer at 233 Kearny
street, stated that on Friday, October 2,
the young man went by steamer to San
Luis Obispo to attend to a matter involv
ing the title of a large tract of land some
where in the eastern part of that county
or the western part of Kern County. A
week ago he received a letter from his son
stating that his visit to San Luis Obispo
had been very satisfactory, and that he
was intending to visit the land in question
and had passed through Santa Marguerita
and Simmler's place.
The land he said was still farther east,
and he expected to meet people who
would guide him to the place he was in
search of. That was the last heard of him,
and bis family has seen anxiously await
ing a second letter. He was expected
home to-morrow.
As may be expected, the family was
sadly grief-stricken, ana his Jpoor mother
was completely prostrated. He was the
only son and 24 years of age. The young
man was born in Baltimore, Md., and
came to this State with his parents twenty
years ago. Hahn received his education
in the Hamilton Grammar School and the
Boys' High School.
He was graduated from the Hastings
Law College and n year and a half ago was
admitted to practice in the profession of
his choice. Since then he has devoted
much of his practice to land cases, and for
a young man was very successful. He was
highly respected and bad a large circle of
intimate friends.
His family at once sÂ°nt to Bakersfield
to have the body forwarded to this City
for interment, and the news that it had
been buried somewhere away in the des
ert added to their distress.
REDWOOD CITY FAIR.
Catholic Ladies of Mount Carmel Church
Open Their Benefit Expo
sition.
REDWOOD CITY, Cal., Oct. 14.â The
ladies' fair for the benefit of Mount Car
mel Catholic Church was opened to-night
under most favorable auspices. Germania
Hall had .been for several days in posses
sion of the decorators, and its appearance

washed away and gr< at damage done to
the San Tomas tunnel at Candeiaria.
D. M. Burns & Co. are considered to be
the heaviest losers at San Vicente and San
Dimas. They also lose heavily at Cande
laria. Mining operations, of course, were
entirely suspended.
The losses in mining and agriculture
between Elota and Centa are estimated at
$200,000, but the loss of life was small.
At San Augustin, on the San Ignacio
River, one body was found and at Hu
maya two more bodies. Three children
were found at Lacienaga, where they had
been washed from above. At Ixpalino ten
houses and all the cattle and horses be
longing to the San Vicente Mining Com
pany were lost. At the same place the
houses and stores of Donemilio Verdugo
and H. M. Edina were a complete loss, in
cluding two retorts full of silver amal
gam. Francisco Beceda, Jesus Ruiz and
two laborers were drowned.
Four peons were drowned at Zapotito.
Miguel Rodriguez of Piaxtla lost his wife
and two children. The San Ignacio River
at its height dragged the family in. He
and his wife tried to save their four chil
dren. He reached land with two and saw
his wife and the other two children
drowned.
At Mazatlan the seas ran over the jetty
of Olas Altas. The waters of the bay
reached as tar in as Plaza Machado. The
Mexican schooner Occidental is now on
shore at that port. The Arizona Railroad,
between Guaymas and Nogales, was
washed out in places and communication
shut off.
The Orizaba ran up to Guaymas and La
Paz and back to Mazatlan and communi
cations were so limited that the only news
obtainable from the devastated districts
was from messengers who brought bullion
from the San Jose de Gracia, Ban Dimas,
Candelaria and other mines. They all re
port the loss of life as heavy in the aggre
gate and the suffering of those surviving
as extreme. Crops along the rivers were
entirely destroyed, granaries and stores
washed away and communication stopped
so that the supplies cannot reach the re
mote districts for a long time.
Couriers were sent from the mining
camps and river points along the San
Ignacio and Santa Polonia rivers to Culia
can and word was thus sent to the City of
Mexico. Relief expeditions were promised,
but so far as ascertainable they are piti
fully inadequate. Unless prompt relief is
afforded mere will be many deaths from
starvation.

Samuel Jackson, the well-known attorney,
is accused by Rebecca A. Rawlins of hav
ing misappropriated many thousands of
dollars.
In her complaint Mrs. Rawlins asserts
that during the month of August, 1891,
she entered into an agreement with Jack
son, under the terms of which he was to
invest certain sums of money for her.
In all $3500 passed through Mr. Jack
son's hands, it is alleged, and only a
small portion of this sum has been ac
counted for.
Sar.ih F. Jackson, wife of Jackson, has
been made a co-defendant in the action.
It is charged that much of the money
alleged to have been fraudulently ob
tained by Jackson was, by devious means,
transferred to the possession of his wife.
It is furthei alleged that much interest
money paid to Jackson has been by him
diverted from its proper channel. H. H.
Welsh is the plaintiff's attorney. The
case will be bitterly contested.

PORTLAND'S SENSATION.
Woman of a Good Social Position Ar
rested for Alleged Pocket-
Picking.
PORTLAND, Ob., Oct. 14.â Mrs. Nellie
C. Jones, occupying a good social position
here, is under arrest for alleged pocket
picking at the exposition last night. For
some time pickpockets have had a good
harvest in the exposition building, and
last night the wife of Superintendent
George W. Baker lent herself as a decoy.
In the pocket of her jacket she carried a
stuffed purse, projecting almost two-thirds
above the edge. An ex-detective who ar
rested Mrs. Jones declares he saw ncr take
the purse and drop it on the floor, but
the part of the building where Mrs. Jones
is alleged to have committed me theft was
very much crowded, and it is quite pos
sible that the pocket-book might have
been jostled out of the decoy's pocket by
the packed, surging mass.
Mrs. Jones is a fine-appearing, well-man
nered and intelligent woman. Before her
release on bail this evening, she said:
"This is simply terrible. I did not realize
my position in the excitement of the mo
ment following my arrest. But during
the night, when I awoke, the horror of the
charge against me presented itself. Par
ticularly tnis is so when I realize that 1
am perfectly innocent of any wrongdoing.
While Ido not wish any one any harm, '
she said in conclusion, "yet I sincerely
hope that the persons haying- picked pock
ets at the exposition may be arrested.
The crimes can easily be proven against
them, while I shall be establish my inno
cence."
MRS. BOOTH AT STANFORD
The Commander of the Volun
teers Talks to Students
and Faculty.
Explains the Necessity of a Separa
tion From tbe Old Salva
tion Army.
STAJNFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.. Oct.
14. â Mrs. Maud Baliington-Booth lectured
here this afternoon to a larve audience
of students and faculty members. The
chappl was crowded long before the lec
ture hour, ana when Dr. Jordan stepped
forward to introduce the speaker there
was not even room for standing, every
available vantage point being taken.
Mrs. Booth's discourse was delivered in
that sincere, ringing style which has made
her fame as a speaker so great. Mrs.
Booth said that she came to address those
present as the representative of an organi
zation that believed in practical work
rather than in talk.
"Our movement," said she, "is very
young as yet, but with the love of God, by
whom it is inspired, it will grow in size,
strength and usefulness. We may be de
rided, contemned and criticized at first,
but, looking to the power that guides the
movement and not the movement itself,
we know that victory is assured."
Referring to the separation of tbe Volun
teers from the regular Salvation Army
Mrs. Booth said: '*We came to find from
constant relation ana work with the peo
ple of this land that we were broadened
by its democratic character. We loved
the land and the people and we found
tnat we could better serve those we
wished to reach by changes from the
regular order; but it'was necessary to send
3000 miles away across the ocean to those
who didn't understand the conditions and
needs and requirements for permission to
make these changes. And then the
answers would come back. 'No, you can't
do it. We don't do it that way here and
you mustn't there.'
"We came to feel like throwing these
answers into the ocean a3 the tea had gone
into Boston harbor before it. We came
to feel that this was too broad, too varied
a land to have its policy outlined 3000
miles away. So we formed the Volunteers
of America. WebeganTinew. independent
of all churches and every church, to do
that work which they couldn't do or were
not doing. We gave up to the old order
everything we possessed and started out
with just $100 of borrowea money. We
did not endeavor to gain by per
suasion a single adherent from the
Salvation Army, for we desired only
such as came to our standard volun
tarily. We desired no mushroom growth
that flourishes in a night and dies in the
day. Now we have over 400 commissioned
officers and 416 commissioned posts, be
sides great offices in New York and our
own printing establishment. Our mission
is the mission of hope and we pray God
that he may bless it and prevent it from
falling into any rut that would curtail its
usefulness."

France.

Predicament of Llewellyn Williams'
Heiress and Her Husband
end Son.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 14.-The fol
lowing cablegram was received by Gov*
ernor Budd this afternoon:
Cannes. France, Oct. 14, 1896.
To Governor Budd, Sacramento. Cal.: Find C.
W. Clarke. Wife, boy and self starving. Com
pel him to cable me $1000 immediately. De
lay means prison. Hereward Hoyts.
The foregoing message is from the hus
band of the former Sacramentan, Mrs.
liucy Williams Auzerais-Hoyte, who at
the present time is evidently in serious
financial distress in the sunny South of
France,
Mrs. Hoyte was the adopted daughter of
the late Llewellyn W illiams of Sacramento,
who bequeathed to her something like
$175,000, which she proceeded to "blow
in" in unprofitable theatrical ventures.
About |100,000 was also left to her young
son, tor whom C. W. Clarke, the wealthy
stockman of Sacramento, is guardian.
The funds of the young son are in the
handa of trustees, and as Clarke is absent
from the city it is impossible to ascertain
whether he will consent to accede to thia
demand or not.
At all events it in no way concerns the
executive head of the State, and as far as
can be learned the Governor will take no
official notice of the demand other than to
place the cablegram in the hands of the
attorney for Mr. Clarke.
NEW WHATCOM AFFRAY.
Mayor Dematto* and Citizen Dibble Fight
in Public
NEW WHATCOM, Wash., Oct. 14.â
James P. Demattos, Mayor of New What
com and silver candidate for the Legisla
ture on the Populist ticket, and Carmi
Dibble, a prominent and well-to-do New
Whatcora citizen, had an encounter near
the Bellingham Bay and Columbia depot
yesterday afternoon, as a result of long
standing ill feeling, intensified on Dibble's
part by tbe recent reversal by the Supreme
Court of the decision of the Superior Court
of Whatcom County in the Demattos-
Jordan case. There were very few wit
nesses to the fight, ana accounts vary as
to which was the aggressor.
Demattos brone his cane over Dibble' 3
head, cutting a long pash, which bled pro
fusely. Dibble then wrenched the cane
from Demattos and thrashed him badly,
so that he is still confined to his room.

SCHOONMARTE AT MODESTO.
Cause of Hard Times Fainted Out by the
->eir Jersey Orator.
MODESTO, Gai-, Oct. 14. â Hon. F.
X. Schoonmaker of New Jersey, now
stamping California in the interest of Mc-
Kinley and Hobart, spoke at Modesto to
night to a large audience. He and ex-
Harbor Commissioner J. F. Bassett of San
Francisco were met at the train by a band
and a delegation of citizens. At the
Tynam Hotel they met many local poli
ticians.
At to-night's meeting T. O. Hocking
presided. A double glee club sang patri
otic songs. Schoonmaker devoted two and
a half hoars to a discussion of the
tariff and silver questions. He claimed
the promulgators of a free trade policy
â were responsible for the worKiDgman's
position in . the United States, the
closing of factories and the impoverish
ment of business generally. Stag
nation in commerce forced the people
of America to economize to the extent of
150.000,000 bushels of wheat since last
year â two and a half bushels per head.
Those who in 1592 enjoyed plenty to eat
now considered themselves lucky to get
sufficient bread to exist. Whatever
caused this loss of work, closing of fac
tories and pinching in supplies had ;
worked the greatest hardships ever put i
upon intelligent people, and it was the
application of a free-trade policy.
What was the remedy? Did the de
monetization of silver in 1573 or tree trade
in 1892 cause this? The passage of a free
coinage Jaw at any ratio would not restore
the times of 1592. It wou!d not cause the
resumption of use of wheat to the extent
of two and ' a half bushels per capita
more, thus allowing wheat-raisers to get
higher prices for their -wheat, nor would
it opsn home factories. Tariff for protec
tion was the remedy, and the onlyoae, :
declared the speaker.

paign. He reviewed the agricultural in
terests of the State, and showed the neces
sity of a return to a huh protective tariff.
He exposed the fallacy of a Democratic
free-silver idea, and closed with an elo
quent appeal to the voters of Yolo County
to uphold the principles of the Repub
lican party. Tne Judge was liberally ap
plauded, and great enthusiasm prevailed
throughout the meeting.

CAPOR IN SAN DIEGO.

Vi. Let Them Dump."
SAN DIEGO, Cal.. Oct. Thomas V.
Cator of San Francisco addressed a large'
audience : here to-night. He devoted his
address to the financial question, and in
dulged in personal criticisms of McKinley
and Republican speakers. . He employed
all the artifices of silver demagogues, ap
pealing to his hearers .to combine against ;
capitalists. â  Cator also tried to pick Ben
Bctterworth - record to pieces and to
counteract the .influence of the Ohio
statesman who made many votes for Me-
Kinley in Southern California.
Among other choice sentiments uttered
by Cator was this: "If they dump ship- j
loads of silver upon us. let them dump.
We will coin it into money, and i: will
raise the price of all products, and we can
pay our debts with half the labor and
sweat that is expended now."

WILL STAY AT STANFORD
Dr. Jordan Would Not Accept a
National Museum Direc
torship.
Reply of the President to Letters
Hinting That He Could Have
the Position.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cai.., Oct.
i 14.â Dr. Jordan stated this evening that the
; directorship of the United States National
Museum became vacant a month ago by
: the sudden death of Dr. G. Brown Goode.
In most regards a directorship in this in
, stitution is the most desirable scientific
position in tne country.
"It has not been offered tome," said the
president of Stanford, "tboueh I have had
a number of private unofficial letters ask
ing whether I would accept the position,
if offered. I replied that I could not ac
cept, as I hope to remain at Stanford as
long as I am fit for any position at all."
Dr. Jordan further stated that he would
not leave Stanford for any position what
soever. A few years ago nothing won d
have suited him better tnan such a
position, and his highest ambition was to
get into that institution; "but now," said
President Jordan, "without my students
; around me; without their enterprises,
< which are also mine: without our foot
! ba 1 team, I wouldn't know what to do."
From the smile which accompanied Dr.
Jordan's worus, it is plain that in de
i dining to allow bis came to go in he was
in earnest, and his heart vi with Stanford,
where he expects to do his life's work.
JORDAN IN FATORED.
Could Have the Appointment if He Cared
to Accept.
WASHINGTON, D. C. Oct. 14.-The
appointment of a successor to Professor
Brown Goode, deceased, as assistant sec
retary of the Smithsonian Institution and
director of the National Museum will be
considered at the January meeting of the
board of regents of the institution. . Direc
tor Gardner Hubbard admitted to-night
that the name of Professor David S. Jordan
of Stanford University bad been suggested
by a member of the board, and that the
suggestion was favorably received. '
It is believed that a naturalist will be
appointed, and Professor Jordan is con
sidered by ail scientists connected with
the Smithsonian Institution and the Na
tional Museum to be one of the most
scholarly and experienced men who could
fill the position. It is questionable,
though, whether Professor Jordan would
be willing to resign his place in Stanford
University, which pays him $10,000 a year,
to accept the directorship, whose salary is
only $4500.

HURON, S. Dak., Oct. 14.â The second '
day of the American Waterloo cup cours- !
ing meeting brought some surprises for j
the talent. Pretender was "touted" as a
sure thing, but was soundly beaten by old
Sir Hugo. The defeat of Minneapolis, the
crack of the kennel, owned in that city by

The weather was again clear and hot, too
warm really for coursing. . -
The attendance was large. Hares were
none too plentiful. Sixteen courses were
run. Not much fault could be found with
the slipping, bat i the judge was not alto

THE INDIANA STORM-TOSSED.
Violent Weather Searlu Ends the Career
of the Battle-Ship.
NEW YORK, K. V., Oct. 14.-The bat
tle-ship Indiana, which arrived to-day
along with the rest of Admiral Bunce's
fleet, was badly used up by tbe storm
which nas raged so violently at sea during
the past few days, and came near the end
of its career.
At 10 o'clock Monday night the Indiana
set up signals to the flagship that the
eight-inch turret in the after battery had
become loose. She was plunging about
under reduced steam, tbe officers har
dened with the dread that the weight of
steel and iron might at any minute be
heaved over upon and destroy the ship.
Soon after the first signal was displayed
a second was sent up that the 13-inch turret
in the forepart of tne ship bad also been
ripped from the camps. It was spinning
around and its great gun was swinging
viciously back and forth as the vessel
plunged.
On Tuesday, after a desperate fight with
the disarranged machinery, the turrets
were fastened with clamps and hawsers.
During all of Monday the ship made only
forty miles. The full injury to the tur
rets had not been ascertained to-night.

jumped onto Pasco and left the marks of
one of his heels on hit face. Pasco was i
unconscious when palled away from the
infuriated ball-players. He was delirious
! ail night and will probably be laid up for
t some days. His face was beaten almost

POPULIST RATIFICATION,
Joseph I Dimond and James G.
Maguire Among Their
Orators.
A Joint Meeting in the Market-Street
Tent, Wfcereat There Was Much
Enthusiasm.
Buckley's Populist lambs held their rati
fication meeting at the People's party tent
last night. In this they were assisted by
a brass band. Nearly all the candidates
were present.
J. H. Tingman called the meeting to
order.
Joseph I. Dimond, Buckley's candidate
for Mayor, was then introduced and was
warmly applauded.
Dimond spoke rather briefly, affirming
with, due solemnity bis position on the
silver question and the candidacy of Wii
liam J. Bryan. /
The speaker read sections from the St.
Louis platform, being frequently inter
rupted by applause.
In endeavoring to vindicate himself
from certain charges made against him as
a candidate Dimond asseverated that they
were "as false as b 1." He denied hav
ing shirked his duty of voting on impor
tant matters which had come before the
Board of Supervisors during the last two
years, and declared that he was one of the
foremost opponents of tbe Geary-street
franchise.
Judge Maguire was then introduced. He
said:
"1 regard the sction of the Populist Na
tional Convention in nominating Bryan,
because he stands for the people as patri
otic in the extreme." In conclusion Judge
Hasuire said his course in tbe future
would be in keeping with the past.
A. B. Kinne, candidate for Congress
from the Fifth, spoke against the new
charter and said tbe time had come when
the people must measure their strength
with the corporations.
Fleet F. btrother, candidate for Audi
tor, thanked the Populists for his nomina
tion. All the candidates for Supervisor
with the exception of one, who was ab
sent, then made brief speeches.
Then came three candidates for Superior
Judge, Frank H. Dunne being absent.
Josepia LeÂ«:gett said tne Populists must
recognize one another when they saw
him, because his nomination was unso
licited. He was for .Bryan and Dimond
and against the "infamous" new charter.
W. G. Burke said he appeared not as a
candidate but as a man interested in the
cause of the people. Judge Robert Ferral
did not speak till near the close of the
meeting.
"Co.ouel :i Jonn O'Byrne, candidate for
District Attorney, spoke strongly of the
A. P. A., and made some remarks border
ing on the anaichistic in referring to
Brvan : s opponents.
Walter Gallagher, candidate for Police
Judge, declared himself a candidate at
heart. Burnett G. Haskell spoke feel
ingly of the time when he was rotten
egged sixteen years ago for trying to form
fa sailors' union.
William Doscher, candidate for Treas
urer; W. F. Hess, for Justice of the Peace,
and D. A. McDonald, for Superintendent
of Streets, made short speeches.
The meeting was adjourned after a few
remarks by Judee Robert Ferral, affec
tionately called "Bobby" by the audience,
who said Archbishop Ireland and Bob
liigersoll now occupied the same bed,
which flower of thought seemed to tickle
the fancy of the audience.

Francisco de Oj*da Returns Home
After Selling His Stable to Presi
dent Barrios.
Francisco de Ojeda has returned from
Guatemala with a bullet wound in his
right ankle and a determination that he
will not return there next year to race bis
horses.
Ojeda is a prominent member of the old
Bay District Track Association and the Cal
ifornia and Pacific Coast Jockey Clubs, and
for tbe past few years he has been ship
ping part of his stable to Guatemala to
run in the Central American Derby.
With Dr. Ross, who was too well known
here to run without a heavy handicap, he
captured the first Derby in Guatemala
some four years ago and year after year
he sent there some horse who carried off
tbe purse. It got so that the veterans of
the Central American turf chafed under
repeated defeats in their yearly great
event and jealousy was engendered to an
unusual degree.
Tbe Derby was to be run on the 12th of
August, and Ojeda arrived with his stable
some time early in Juiy. He found that
his main competitor was a man named
Schumann, who bad two entries against
which no one would start so sure was he
of winning. Ojeda, however, had a mare
in bis stable he was willing to enter and
back until a few days of the event, when
he found there was something wrong
about her. He said nothing, however,
ana it was not known that only Schu
mann's horses would run.
On the afternoon of tbe 11th of August
Ojeda and a party of friends were at din
ner in the Gran Hotel and were discussing
track matters when an individual, who
was subsequently recognized as the second
secretary to President Barrios, but whose
back was turned to tbe party, rose and
called Ojeda "Bobosa." Wniie not an in
sult of a very grievous kind, it was suffi
cient to cause Ojeda to slap tbe man's
face.
The affair, which at first promised to be
more serious, passed away without any
further ado.
"At 9 o'clock that night," said Mr. Ojecia,
"I was shot by some unknown person as I
was walking upstairs to my apartments.
I never saw who did it, nor do I know
whether it is the outcome of my slapping
tbe fellow's face who insulted me.
â¢'There is one thine certain, and that is
I have quit racing in Guatemala. 1 sold
all my horses there to President Barrio?,
and I will not send any more down there
to compete for the Derby. I have won it
often enough to satisfy me, and if winning
it again involves a shooting scrape, or if I
cannot slap a man's face who insults me
without being shot at from tbe rear and in
ambush, I think I'd better stay and race
here."

SHOPS MAY GO SOUTH.
Property-Owners in the Potrero
Section on the Line of
Progress
Anticipations That the Railroad Will
Locate Its Factories
There.
The property-owner in South San Fran
cisco who claims to have a "tip" on what
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company
intends doing in the near future are
hastening to improve the streets in that
locality.
The grading of Railroad avenue from
Eighteenth avenue out to the Five-mile
House, a distance of about two miles, is a
starter in the direction of making the
southern side of the peninsula an opening
into San Mateo County.
When this road is complete it will join
the old San Bruno road at its intersection
at the Five-mile House, thus bringing the
Mission and the south side into more
direct connection with the business por
tion of the City proper.
In anticipating tbis the knowing ones
have kept a sharp lookout on the
maneuvers of the company, and have no
ticed a gang of men working on a tunnel
through the hill at the Five-mile House,
which property belongs to the railroad
company. As Mr. Huntington and his
agents guard their realty with a very
zealous eye, it is considered hardly pos
sible that the excavators are catting a
tunnel through the hill for the fun of it.
This movement, together with the pur
chasing oi land along the contemplated
line over and under which the southern
route is said to be likely to run, as also
the ownership of the site mentioned for
the supposed shops, leads the people to
believe that South San Francisco has a big
future before it
After Sullivan's Scalp.

His Skull Fractured.
J.C. Kearney, a shoemaker living at 1115
Leaven worth street, was riding on an east
bound car last night, and just before it reached
the crossing at Leavenworth street he jumped
off, right in front of a westbound car. Before
the gripmaa could stop the car Kearney was
struck by the ear and knocked down, his head
hitting the ground with great force- Dr.
Thompson found that his skull was fractured,
and that he could not recover." Kearney's
wife died about two years ago, leaving eleven'
children, some of them very young.
Metheny Will Contest.
Tbe contest of the will of Jane Metheny was
yesterday begun in Judge Slack's court. The
testatrix left an estate valued at $19,500, most
of which she bequeathed to her sisters, leaving
but &200 to her husband, Ne&l G. Metaeoy, a
streetcar driver.
Metheny, who was five rears hlÂ« wife's
junior, claims that she promised to leave her
property to him, bat that during the last year
of her life, being ill and of unsound mind, she
was influenced by her relatives to practically
leave him out.

I HABITS. :
i Some Hare Them and Others Are Xof
â Without. |
A man likes some hot drink for break-
fast, and coffee suits his taste about as well
as anything. It seems hard that so many i
should be denied coffee because it np:ets
their liver and disagrees with them in one
war ; and another. J Still this condition
does exist, and when a man finds it burrs
him he is generally sensible enough to
leave it oat of his bill of fare, for it is quite
a bit pleasanter to feel well all day than to
enjoy a drug tÃ"obr three minutes and pay
for it in aches and ails or sickness.
Anew breakfast drink has come into

Charters at Very High
Rates.
Thirteen of Them Swung With
the Tide Yesterday After
noon.
SOME WILL GO TO CALCUTTA.

Offers of Big Money Have Been
Refused.
A few months ago almost the entire
disengaged fleet was tied up at Sausalito.
At that time Richardsons Bay was
crowded. Now that vessels are in de
mand the oniy craft left over there is the
California Improvement Company's Ore
gon. Yesterday there were thirteen ves
sels, including steamers, barks, barken
tines and ships, in the bay awaiting a
chance to sail.
Many of them were in ballast, and the
captains were patiently awaiting a chance
to dock, and also the probable advance in
rates and consequently an increased pay
roll. Just how the matter will pan out
remains to be seen.
The British Princess arrived from Aus
tralia yesterday. The captain reports that
on October 8 in latitude 35 44 south, longi
tude 135 37 west, he passed what appeared
to him to be a disabled ship, about fifty
feet long, but which proved to be the up
per deck of a ship. The derelict was evi
dently the same wreck reported by the
tramp steamer City of Dublin.
Three of the crew of the whaler Hidalgo
arrived on the schooner Bonanza yester
day.
The Hidalgo went ashore at or near
Point Hope. The captain, while attempt
ing to work into winter quarters, was
caught in an icefloe, and before the vessel
could be put about she was "nipped" and
the crew had to take to the ice.
Now the men say that if it had not been
for the arrival of some of the whaling fleet
they would have starved. They put up
tents on the ice and did the best they
could until the revenue cutter Bear came
along. Captain Tuttle took all the men
aboard and got them passages aboard the
various vessels bound for San Francisco.
The yacht Coronet will sail for New
York to-day. She will go arouna the
Horn and Captain Crosby will sail her.
Captain James, the owner, has cone home
overland, and Crosby is now in supreme
controL Only one passenger will go in
the vessel â C. Spalding, son of a New
York merchant, who wants to make the
trip on account of his bealth.
Ihe Captain Largemore, which arrived
here a few days ago, reports passing the
Loch Broom on September 18 in latitude

JORDAN MAY FIGHT BACK
The Courts as a Last Chance
Against a Paving
Job.
There Will Be a Row in the Board if
the Work Is Attempted to Be
Put Through.
Some members of the Board of Super
visors are considerably excited over what
tbey declare is a barefaced job on some
body's part, and if it passes the Street
Committee of the board at to-day's meet
ing there is sure to be trouble when the
Supervisors meet next Monday. Only
after the board adjourned Monday was it
discovered that the Sunervisor3 had voted
in favor of the so-called job, as it had
come up in various resolutions. Being
street work and having passed through the
customary course, no particular attention
was paid to it until the facts were pointed
out.
Then the Supervisors not on "the in-
F : de" saw that they had been voting for
the pavine of streets in a Richmond tract
with bituminous rock. On inquiry they
found further that the same tract has not
a single house upon it, but is graded,
fenced aid the roadways macadamized,
Siwertd ana curbed. There are eight
lar.p blocks in the tract, and these are
turrounded by tweniy-two "'blocks" or
streets, each one being the length or width
of the rectangular ; ieres of real estate
constituting the tract. To lay bituminons
rock npon these streets would cost all the
way from $75,000 to $100,000, for it would
then become necessary for the land-owner
â  :o either first make sewer connections
with the lots, or iater to cut up the con
crete and bitumen every time a house
would b_- built.
A protest was filed against the proposed
work last week, and if it is not favorably
considered the case will be taken into the
courts and there fought to a finish.
The tract in question is familiarly known
as the "Jordan tract." It lies imme
diately west of Laurel Hill Cemetery, and
includes the territory from California
street to Point Lobos avenue and from the
cemetery to First avenue. Rich avenue,
running parallel to California street,
divides it into two parts, while the prop
erty faces on five transverse streets â Wil
liamson street, Commonwealth avenue,
Jordan avenue, Michigan avenue and
First avenue.
At last Monday's meeting of the Board
of Supervisors a bid was passed calling
for t;ie paving with bitumnn of California
street, fronting on the Jordan tract.
"About that part of it we have no objec
tion to offer." remarked Secretary Cross
man of the Jordan Company yesterday.
"Mr. Jordan is away in the East, and
those people have simply taken advantage
of his absence. He does not object to
paving with bitumen in front of the tract
either on California street or Point Loops
avenue, though there is not a house on
that long frontage, but when it comes to
bituminizing streets in a new and unin
habited tract he protests decidedly.
"This thing was started on a bogus
petition from a bogus improvement club.
We examined into the matter very
carefully and found that the club does not
exist. The names on the petition we
(found did not belong to people in the dis
trict. To make this improvement, for
which there ia no reason, would cost us
about $75,000 or more. It is an injustice
Jo attempt such a proposition."
Supervisor Dimond declares that he will
fight this matter. "I believe this is the work
of some street contractors,'' said he, "and it
certainly is preposterous. Mr. Jordan,
lhÂ« owner of the property, owns a bitumen
mine in San Luis Obispo County, but he
cannot even pave these street 3 with his
own rock. He was shut out with others
by the bituminous rock onler passed by
the present board shortly after the begin
ning of its term of office.
"He fought that ordinance, and now it
appears, from all I've been told, that rivals
are playing this trick on him."

intendent of Streets. A resolution whs passed,

School Director Murdock sent a commu
nication to the Board of Education at its
meeting last evening requesting permis
sion to withdraw the resi. nation he pre
sented at the last meeting. A motion was
made to permit the Director to retain h>s
seat in the board, but Superintendent
Babcock denied his right to withdraw the
resignation and notified the board that he
would name Mr. Murdock's successor at
the next meeting.
The board accepted the following rec
ommendations of the City Board of Ex
aminers that were adopted at an adjourned
meeting held on tho Bth mst. :

ferred to the Buildings and Grounds Com
mittee.
The petition of the lighthouse-keepers
on the Farailon Islands for a school on the
islands was denied by the board on the
ground of a lack of funds. A like course
was taken in the matter of the application
for a class in navigation in the night
schools.
The board vrangled for an hour over
the question as to whether the suit of
Miss Annie Hinds against the department
should be appealed to the Supreme Court,
and finally decided that it should not.
The question as to whether the suits of
Miss Orr and Mrs. Williamson, based on
the same points, should be appealed was
referred to the City and County Attorney.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1896.
LOYAL GERMANS
ALL FOR McKINLEY
Orators So Declare to a
Very Enthusiastic
Audience.
Big Rally of German-American
Republicans at the
Auditorium.
FOUR ELOQUENT ADDRESSES.
0 F. yon Rhein, George Knight, Ex-
Governor Salomon and A. S.
Bundshu Speak.
Patriotic Americans of German parent
age crowded the Auditorium last evening,
in response to the call for a rally of Ger
man-Americans in behalf of McKinley
and protection. A brass band occupied
the orchestra's place in front of the stage,
two big bonfires blazed in the street in
front of the building, and other evidences
of enthusiastic interest in the issue
abounded. A number of prominent Ger-
mans occupied the stage. Robert Wei
neke, president of the Krieger Verein,
presided.
After music and a short address by the
chairman, O. F. yon Rhein was intro
duced. He spoke in German, the tongue
of the Fatherland, he said, where memory
loved to turn. But they that were gath
ered there were Americans in the best
sense of that word; America was their
country, ana they owe it their most
sacred allegiance. He compared the
two political parties, the onward and
upward tendency of Republicanism, the
party that had saved the Union and
driven slavery from the land, and paid
the war debt in honest money, and then
the negative and halting tendency of the
Democracy, that had never done anything
worth speaking about. The party of
Blame, Grant, Lincoln and Garfield was
reproached with being unrepublican and
undemocratic because it does not stand
for independent bimetallism â a measure
fraught with certain ruin and disaster.
"Money," said the speaker, "is an inter
national matter, as are the rules of war.
It takes the whole world to make 53 cents
worth lOOcents."
George Knight was introduced as a man
who needed no introduction and was
greeted with an enthusiastic burst of ap
plause.
He said he came not to argue, but rather
to compliment. He knew the sturdy Ger
man, the man who loves order and re
spects law, who loved National as well as
individual honor, would be found on the
right side on the day when the battle for
good government, now going on, would
be determined. He paid a handsome
tribute to the German nation and German
! individuals who had made history, and
was warmly applauded.
8. Bundshu was the next speaker. He
said the era of business paralysis was
drawing to a close. Prosperity, however,
was not to be purchased by repu
diation. The speaker read Bismarck's
famous letter and pointed out that its
whole spirit and tenor was in accordance
with the Republican platform. As to the
advisability of this country for her own
good adopting free coinage of silver at this
time Bismarck, he said, had nothing to
say.
The speaker discoursed at some length
the deplorable condition of labor in all
silver countries and begged his hearers
not to aid in the inauguration of such con*
ditions in this great land.
Ex-Governor Salomon followed. He re
ferred pleasantly to the pretty compli
ments of George Knight to Germany and
the German people.
"Bat," he said, "we are here as Ameri
cans; German- Americans, If you please."
He said there were few Germans who were
not good Republicans â only about 10 per
cent of the total vote cast by Americans of
German descent would vote against Me-
Kir ley, and that was a liberal allowance.
Brief addresses were made by Carroll
Cook and Judge Campbell and the meet
ing adjourned with three rousing cheers
for McKinley and prosperity.
Mmt Prove Sobriety.
The minor heirs of the Crocker estate Tues
day filed their answer to the petition of
George Crocker for $500,000 of trust property,
which was to be turned over to him if be xc
malnad sober for five yelars. They say they
have no definite knowledge that Crocker was
not intoxicated during that period and ask
that he be required to prove it.
DEANE AS AUDITOR.
Enthusiastic Meeting of His Sup
porters Last Night.
About four hundred admirers of W. A.
Deane, Republican candidate for Auditor,
met in Judge Babrs' courtroom last night
to discuss ways and means for securing
his election. Among the number were
representatives from all political parties,
and the utmost enthusiasm prevailed.
Alfred Fuhrman made the speech of the
evening. He said although a Democrat he
would not lose his Democracy by casting
his ballot for Deane as Auditor. He was
willing to support the best man for the
office irrespective of party, and Deane was
the man. Stirring addresses were also de
livered by J. C. Reilly, T. C. Maher, Fred
Frey, George Lee and other.
THE BIZAAR IS OVER,
The Festival Calculated to Have
Made a Very Large
Sum.
James R Kelly Delivers an Address
at the Cose of the Youths'
Directory Fair.
The grand bazaar in aid of the Youths'
Directory closed last night after a most
successful ran of three weeks' duration.
The large driliroom of the First Regiment,
N. G. C, at Tenth and Market streets was
so crowded with ladies ana gentlemen
that barely room to move about was left
on the floor. Everybody present ap
peared to have entered into the spirit of
the occasion and felt that it was a farewell
night, calling for a grand finale in the
cause of charity.
In all it was roughly estimated that the
festival has resulted in the gathering in of
from 110,000 to $12,000.
The voting contest for the most popular
police captain overshadowed everything
else last night. It attracted a crowd of
friends and admirers of the various cap
tains around ihe stage, whither the voting
booth had been moved from Kearny street.
Many votes were cast at the eleventh hour,
until the vote st od as follows at the time
appointed for closing:
Captain Scillane. 8,621
Captain Dunlevy ; â¢ t5,254
.Captain v\ lit man 1,916
Captain Glllen. 717
captain Lees. 382
Captain Robinson. >.. . 116
At the close James R. Kelly delivered
the following address:
Ladies and Gentlemen : I take great pleasure,
on behalf of the trustees of the "Youths' D
irectory" and of the committee ot arrange
ments, in publicly thanking all those who
I have contributed to the success of the "les
tival" In aid of our "homeless boys."
In the first place we owe a deep debt of grati
tude to the noble ladies who previous to the
inauguration of this fair and during tne three
weeks of its continuance have labored so faith
fully, so patiently and so energetically to
carry out the instructions and plans of the
committee of arrangements, and to whose un
tiring exertions we are indebted for the suc
cess that has crowned the ciwritable enter
prise. We offer our sincere thanks to the
artists, amateurs and others, who have suc
ceeded so admirably in amusing and enter
taining us on every evening during this fes
tival, and whose efforts to please hare elicited
i so much applause from the thousands who
were attracted to this hall by the mere men
tion of their names.
We thank -with our whole hearts the press
of San Francisco for the kind and generous
treatment it has accorded us, not only during
the continuance of this festival, but lor weeks
previous to its commencement. Indeed the
various newspapers, without exception, spared
no pains to advertise it, devoting mucii valu
able space in announcing to the public the
dally progress made by the different com
mittees, and nearly every day during the past
three months urging their readers to patron
ize ana support the Tair in aid of the Youths'
Directory.
Nor can we forget how much we owe our
beloved vicar-general for his words of encour
agement and approval and tor the eloquent
and earnest appeal he has made to our citi
zens to come forward and assist the trus
tees of the institution in their laudable efforts
to erect and mnintaln a suitable establish
ment where neglected and Homeless boys, irre
spective of creed, color or nationality, will be
trained to habits of industry and self-reliance,
and will be sheltered and protected from the
snares and allurements that surround the
footsteps of the young and inexperienced in
our large cities.
Finally, we thank the charitable people who
have contributed so generously and liberally
in aid of our depleted treasury. And now in
conclusion I wish to state that I am instructed
to inform you that all articles remaining un
sold at the different booths will be removed
from this hall to the Youths' Directory and
will be there disposed of, either at private
sale or public auction.
Sacred Heart Bazaar.
The festival now being held at the
armory, Page and Gough streets, in aid of
the church about to be erected in the
Sacred Heart parish is a success of the
highest degree.
Last night an interesting programme
was rendered, the feature of which was an
exhibition drill by the young ladies of the
parish, under the command of Miss N.
Waters.
The officers of the National Guard*, from
field and staff, have promised to be in at
tendance this evening. An excellent pro
gramme has been arranged, and from the
prospects the evening will be a grand one.
The committee in charge expects to
close the fair Saturday evening, and re
quests all who are in sympathy with the
building of the new church to call and
spend some time in the bazaar.
A large number of valuable articles will
be sold and raffled at the different booths
on the closing nigtit.
The O'Neil Case.

William T. Hamilton Takes
Poison in the Home of
His Sweetheart.
Miss Tessie Moore, a Mere
Girl, the Object of His
Affections.
HE SAID HE SOUGHT SELIZER.
Tells His Mother That He Drank
Whisky to Nerve Himself Up
to the Deed.
William T. Hamilton, 19 years of age,
son of C. Hamilton, manager of the A. L.
Bancroft Piano Company, 320 Post street,
committed suicide by swallowing a
large dose of strychnine in the home of
his sweetheart, Tessie Moore, 1915}Â£ Mc-
Allister street, last evening at 7 o'clock.
Young Hamilton had been keeping com
pany with Miss Moore, a very pretty girl
but 17 years of age, for over a year. He
was deeply infatuated with the young
woman and she reciprocated his affections.
They were to have been married some six
months ago, but both being under age
their wish could not be gratified without
the consent of their parents.
This was not forthcoming on the part of
the young man's father and he was mis
erable. Nevertheless he determined to
continue the relations which had existed
for many months between them. He called
regularly on his sweetheart and they fre
quently went out together.
Tuesday evening they went to the the
ater, and young Hamilton was more than
usually agreeable. According to the grip
man of the car on which the young couple
returned to their respective homes, they
chatted gayly and appeared to ba per
fectly contented.
Yesterday afternoon Mr. Hamilton, tlie
suicide's father, received a note from his
son in which he said that he was going to
Oakland with a friend. "I thought noth
ing more of the matter," said Mr. Hamil
ton, "until I received word that my son
had taken poison. I did not believe the
report at first, bnt finally called my wife
and we went together to Miss Moore's
home. It was indeed true. The poor boy
was dying, but still conscious, when we
reached him.
" 'I drank whisky to nerve myself up to
commit this act,' said my son as his sob
bing mother leaned over him. 'I had to
drink whisky to dc it, but I was so un
happy. I couldn't marry Tessie, so I have
killed myself,' he said, and then became
unconscious.
"He took the poison at about 7 o'clock,
and although tlie physician called in did
everything in his power he died at 9
o'clock. â¢
"I have not opposed the marriage of my
son and Miss Moore for six months," con
tinued Mr. Hamilton, "ana when I did
object to the marriage it was owing solely
to Will's youth. He was only a boy and
entirely dependent upon me for support.
If be bad been able to support himself and
the girl it would have been different.
"I don't know what made him commit
suicide," said Miss Moore, referring to
young Hamilton. "We did not quarrel;
but he was never contented. He left here
and went to a drugstore a few minutes
before he took the poison, and I believe
he went out to buy it. He returned, ana
saying that he was going to take some
seltzer, went to the Kitchen.
"In a minute he said that he bad taken
poison, and we found the empty strych
nine phial; that is all I know. The
young girl was nervous, being unused to
such scenes as she had witnessed a few
minutes before, and referred to the sad
case with tear-dimmed eyes."
The Coroner's office decided that it was
a case of suicide and allowed the body to
be removed to Mr. Hamilton's home, 504b
Baker street.
The mother and sister of the deceased

WRANGLING WHEELMEN,
A Delegate Declares the League
Turned Over to the Demo
cratic Party.
Edwin Mohrig Asserts That the Re
publican Party Has No Claim for
Recognition From Cyclists.
The Wheelmen's Municipal League met
last evening in the rooms of the Imperial
Cycling Club at 614 Van Ness avenue,
Frank H. Kerrigan presiding, W. B.
Fawsett secretary. â¢
It was reported that 502 unattached
riders had joined the league during the
past two weeks.
The principal object of the meeting was
the ad v) .ability of indorsing certain can
didates in the coming municipal election,
and it brought about rather acrimonious
debate.
It was finally decided that Lawrence
Devany, J. H. Sheehan, J. S. Conwell and
Dr. Rottanzi be specially indorsed as Su
pervisorial candidates. Edwin Afohrig's
motion that the league's indorsement
cease there stirred up the strife.
Delegate Adams called attention to the
fact that the various conventions had in
serted a plank in their respective plat
forms favoring the demands of the wheel
men, hence the different political organi
zations should be given recognition. In
stead of that the league had voted to in
dorse three Democratic Supervisors and
one Non-Partisan, completely ignoring the
Republican party.
Edwin Mohrig believed the Republican
party entitled to no recognition.
Delegate A. G. McFarland denounced
the line of proceeding into which the
league had entered, saying:
"It looks very much now as if the
Wheelmen's Municipal League has been
turned over as a body to the Democratic
party.' 1
J. W. Maguire indorsed Delegate Adams'
remarks, and the motion to close indorse
ments with the four favorites mentioned
was lost This was the signal for dele
gates from all parts of the hall clamoring
for recognition. Each had some favorite
candidate he wanted indorsed by the
league. E. J. Smith, Charles Gildea, John
Lachman and William Wolf were each
presented in turn, the sponsors for these
candidates aeclaring them friendly to the
wheelmen and deserving of support.
The matter was voted over to the next
meetine, to be held in two weeks, J. W.
Maguire closing a motion to that effect
with the remark:
"I told you not to mix in politics. Now
you're in the pool; you'll have to take
time to swim out."

FOB PRESIDEXT-
WILLIAM McKINLEY, of Oblo
fOB TICK-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
The Popocrats seem determined to make
it a bugaboo campaign.
To the mind of the anarchist the en
forcement ofjlaw is coercion.
It is not necessary for Bryan to talk
about the tariff; his record speaks for
him.
Make yonrself count on the side of pro
tection during the campaign as well as on
election day.
California must send to Congress men
who will guard her industries. We can
not trust to free-traders.
When we have rid the country of Demo
cratic legislation we will have freed the
people from the Democratic depression.
Caesar had his Brutus, Charles I his
Cromwell and Bryan has bis tongue and
not sense enough to profit by their ex
ample.
The Populist National Committee talks
much about "unselfish devotion" and
then proceeds to sacrifice Watson as a
scapegoat.
California is counted as a doubtful
State, but it will not be doubtful if all the
friends of protection and sound money do
their dutj.
Not a single statesman of any repute is
supporting Bryan. Does not that signify
be has already received the condemnation
f the people? t
Wherever Bryan went in Minnesota he
was met by cheers for McKiniey, and yet
there are people who talk of the lake
States being doubtful.
So long as we employ foreign nations to
do our work our own people will be un
employed, our money will go abroad and
the hard times wiil continue.
We must have a Republican Congress as
well as a Republican President. Let us
sweep the fiasco statesmen out of all
branches of the Government.
Protection at home, reciprocity abroad
and sound money both at home and
abroad are necessary to our prosperity,
and the Republican party stands for all of
them.
When McKiniey touches the Presiden
tial button the doors of industry and the
gates of commerce will spring open, and
American energy can be counted op to do
the rest.
Between Tom Watson and his National
Committee there is now a gaping chasm,
but the chances are Tommy can send his
voice across it without losing strength on
the way.
There may be some people foolish
enouch to cut off their noses to spite their
faces, but even of these very few will be
willing to cut the value of their wages in
two to spite their employers.
McKiniey, tD6 soldier statesman, grows
in public estimation every day. He is
going to be one of the illustrious Presi
dent wno are remembered in the homes
as well as in the history of the country.
The Texas livestock men are demand
ing reciprocity for the purpose of opening
markets for their products, an i of course
they know whom to vote lor in order to
get it. Texas has her face to the morning.
We hardly need any of the big Eastern
orators to help us carry California for pro
tection and sound money, but tney will
be welcome just the same. The principles
of Republicanism can never be taught too
much.
Archbishop Ireland's warning against
the tendencies of Bryanism should be
heeded by every patriotic American. A
party that starts wrong is sure to go from
bad to worse if it is permitted to go on
â¢tail.
It is noted in the East that political
audiences are showing more interest in
the tariff issue than in the money ques
tion. They have come to the conclusion
that open milis are better than open
mints.
The St. Louis merchant who discharged
pome of his employes b cause they did not
agree with him in politics has been made
very sorry for himself. Coercion may
pass as a campaign bugaboo, but it won't
do to practice in this country.
With restored prosperity and a strong
Government at the head "of onr affairs
there can be little douDt of the ability of
the United States to bring about an inter
national agreement for the free coinage of
silver, and there is no reason whatever
why a genuine bimctallist should support
the risky experiment of Bryanism.
AMERICAN PROSPERITY.
Mr. Mulhall, one of the most accurate
statisticians in the world, writing in 1892
said: "History affords no parallel to the
progress of the United States in the last
decade." The American people are aware
of the truth of these words. At the
time they were written every farmer was
prosperous, every mill was running, every
workingman was employed, and pros
perity existed in every home. In one
brief year all that prosperity was blighted.
Disaster fell upon the country, affecting
the National revenues, the wages of the
people, the profhs of capital and the wel
fare of every industry. We know the
moment this disaster occurred and we
know also the cause of it.
Mr. Cleveland entered office finding the
country prosperous, but he entered it with
a threat to break down the barriers which
protected American industry from the
competition of European labor. In the
face of that threat, backed by a Congress
with a Democratic majority powerful
enough to enable Mr. Cleveland to carry
it out, the prosperity of the country van
ished and from that day to this we have
been living under the shadow of hard
times. Since evil legislation caused the
ruin, it is certain that good legislation
can repair it. The sole issue before the
people therefore at this time is to elect to
office men who will restore the Repub
lican policy of protection, and to sweep
from every branch of the Government the
fiasco statesmen who brought about the
destitution and disasters of the past three
years.
in 1892 every man and woman who
wanted work was able to obtain it at
wages 60 per cent higher, estimated in
gold, than in 1860, and 22 per cent higher
tban in 1870. We had the gold standard
then as now. It worked no evil under the
protective system. The cause of our troubles
is the extent to which we have adopted free
trade. It requires no great intelligence,
therefore, to see that the remedy needed
for the existing depression is not a change
of the monetary system of the country,
but a change in the tariff system.
When in Congress Mr. Bryan avowed
himself an advocate of even lower tariff
duties than those of the Wilson bill. He
opposed by every means in bis power the
adoption of the Senate amendments to the
Wilson bill, which gave to American in
dustry sucn scanty protection as it enjoys
to-day. There is no reason to believe he
has changed his opinions on these sub
jects. If elected to the Presidency he
would certainly use the whole influence of
that great office to carry the folly of free
trade further yet, ana the ruin which has
been occasioned by the Gorman tariff
would be as nothing to the ruin which
would follow the tariff legislation of a
Bryanite Congress, urged on by the ex
citable boy orator himself.
In the light of this past experience it
should require no campaign of education
to instruct the American people which
way prosperity lies. We have the lamp
of experience to cast a light along the
pathway of the future. By its rays we can
see in which way is danger and in which
way is safety. Let us walk by that light,
and we will walk securely. With Brvan
there would surely be disaster; with Mc-
Kiniey we can count on an assurance of
prosperity in the Nation and peace, com
fort and plenty in every home.
We propose to maintain intact against
every assault the constitutional right
and duty of the President of the United
States to enforce all National laws with
out asking the consent of the Governor
of any State. We propoie that the Fed
eral judiciary snail be kept In the fall
ami dlgn fled discharge of every duty
that the constitution confides to It. â Ben
jamin Harrison.
UNSELFISH DEVOTION.
The National Committee of the People's
party has issued an address to the Pop
ulists urgine them to support the fusion
ticket, notwithstanding the fact that the
Democrats have not acted fairly in carry
ing out the programme designed at St.
Louis.
It is the opinion of the committee that
it would be better for the Populists to sup
port the Democrats, notwithstanding
their unfairness, than it would be to break
ud the fusion and thereby make certain
the election of the Republican candidate.
This sacrifice of the interests of the Pop
ulists on the altar of Democratic greed the
committee is pleased to call "unselfisn de
votion." Whether it is unselfish or not is
for the Populists themselves to determine.
There is a strong probability that the
members of the committee were not
wholly unselfish in advocating it. '
We have eeen in this State that Mr. Ca
tor, one of the strongest advocates of
fusion, has found a means whereby he can
well feather his own nest out of the re
sults of this unselfish devotion. It is not
unselfish on his part since he sees in it the
prospect of attaining the Senatorship.
How easy it is for him to counsel others
to sacrifice their party organization and
their party principles, since he is to derive
a profit from it. Staunch Populists will
find it difficult to understand why they
shou d agr c to surrender so much to sain
so iittle. When unselfishness is carried to
this extent il generates bossism and des
potism. No men can retain their rights
without fighting against everything which
wrongs them. In the present case, what
the Populists would exhibit in supporting
fusion would be not a manifestation of
"unselfish devotion," but of self-abase
ment, and that we can hardly b li-ve any
earnest-minded American will consent to.
Whether the action of the Populist com
mittee was determined by a desire to be
tray Watson in the interests of Sewali or
was the result of a panic fear that Bryan
ism w iil be defeated so badly that Popu
lism will fall with it is not certain. In
either case the address, weak in itself, will
gain nothing from an explanation of the
motives which prompted it. Staunch Popu
lists can now see how foolish or how cor
rupt are the men they have trusted, and
how important it is for them to stand firm
if they would save their party from total
disruption.
The advertisements in 1892 In the
newspaper* used to ran "Men wanted."
The advertisements that run in the
newspapers to-day read "Situations
wanted." Our policy seeks to give a sit
uation to every man of this country who
wants to work, and the policy of partial
free trade has put the working-men in a
situation which entails upon them loan,
and upon every farmer of the country
ii jury in his home market. â McKiniey.
THE DAY OF RECKONING.
A storm of anger is brooding in the
hearts and minds of the old-time leaders
of the Democratic party throughout the
State of California. The shameful realiza
tion of the fact that they have been bun
koed by the Cator wing of the Populist
party rankles in their minds like a
poisoned arrow in the flesh.
That they feel the humiliation to which
they have been subjected is apparpnt in
every utterance they give forth; yet as
they see no practicable escape from the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1896.
pit into which they allowed themselves
to be led, it is quite probable that no vigor
ous outcry will be made at tne present.
It ia likely that such Democrats as are
opposed to the dominance of Mr. Cator
over their organization will follow the
usual Democratic motto, which inculcates
the theory that under adverse circum
stances they shall "say nothing and saw
wood."
Their opportunity for "sawing wood"
to some purpose will come on election day,
when the overwhelming defeat of the
fusion nominees put forward by the Tom
Cator Populists and the Steve White
Democrats will be subjected to a drubbing
they will remember for the remainder of
their lives. Genuine Democrats whore
sent this monstrous invasion and usurpa
tion of their party's right to self-govern
ment â¢will have no recourse except to sup
port the straight-out Republican nominees
for the Legislature, and it is plain that
this is the course they will be most likely
to pursue.
The plain recital of the confidence game
dexterities practiced by Mr. Cator and the
powerful influences at his back aroused
feelings of disgust not alone among Demo
crats but also among such middle-of-the
road Populists as wisned to see their
party freed from the baneful effects of
entangling alliances. In this sentiment
all members of the Populist party who
are not Cator Populists join, and they are
to be honored for it They stand for
honesty and fair dealing in politics, just
as do those Democrats who protest against
the bargain to which Senator White has
evidently given assent, whereby the
Democratic party south of Tehachapi is
permitted to lapse into nothingness, or,
at most, to become a very light tail to the
Cator-Poculistic kite.
The history of the United States has
demonstrated that no good has ever
come of incongruous fusions or affilia
tions, formed solely lor the purpose of
securing political plunder. Such slippery
schemes have seldom, if ever, achieved
even temporary prosperity, and when
they fail, as ultimately they must, both
parties to the unholy alliance suffer the
blighting consequences of their evil acts.
By the people, to whom all such matters
must at last be referred for settlement,
they are adjudged and condemned.
As Republicans the remedy we propose
is that a harmonious, well-adjusted
revenue-producing and protective tariff
shall be substituted, that the revenues
of the Government shall be made ade
quate to its expenditure. "tVe propose
that the necessity for bond sales to re
plenish a diminished treasury and to
restore a wasting gold reserve shall be
remedied by filling the treasury of the
United States with adequate revenue.
We propose that the money of the coun
try, whether in its various forms or sil
ver and gold, shall, every dollar of it,
be kept at a parity with every other
dollar. â Benjnmin Harriaon.
COERCION REBUKED.
If anything were needed to convince the
American people that the cry of coercion
raised by the Bryanite orators and organs,
and not infrequently uttered by Bryan
himself, is utter foily and nonsense, that
proof woula be furnished by the result of
a silly attempt at coercion in St. Louis, to
which attention has already been called in
onr columns.
It will be remembered that a merchant
oi that city, reported to be a strong advo
cate not of bimetallism, which the Re
publican party supports, but of the single
KO.d standard, of which Mr. Cleveland is
the most eminent champion, discharged
from his employment a number of men
whom he found to be advocates of the free
coinage of silver. Our reports of yester
day announce that an indignation meet
ing of people of all parties was held to de
nounce this action, and that the merchant
himself, on maturer consideration of it,
bad seen the folly as well as the partial
criminality of his conduct and had asked
his discharged worKingnien to return to
their employment.
The incident is not an unfortunate one.
It comes in good time to answer and re
fute all the charges of coercion ana in
timidation tbat are now being so freely
made by the Bryanites. It makes clearly
manifest that the American people will
submit to nothing of that kind. If co
ercion were attempted it would be r -
buked in every city in the Union. Such
tactics are false, not only to the princi
ples of every American party but to the
manhood of the country. They could
not be employed witn success in any part
of the Union. Men of all parties would
condemn them as they have condemned
them in this case in St. Louis, and the
man who tried them would find himself
ruined in business and srorned in society.
After this experience even the Bryanites
shouid see the folly of making any lurther
talk about coercion and Intimidation. If
it is on-American to. attempt coercion it
ia equally un-American to submit to it, or
even express a fear of it. We cannot be
lieve that any number of American work
ingmen have given any serious thought
to this foolish and senseless cry. Even
the men who in the free-silver parade at
Chicago wore masks must have done it
more as a joke than anything else.
A free ballot and a fair count are vital
to American liberty and American insti
tutions. He is false to America who at
tempts to violate them, and he is not less
false who submits to the violation. It is
to be hoped we will hear no more of such
stories in this or any other campaign.
Oie attempt of the sort is enough.
Everybody can learn the lesson from the
Bt. Louis merchant, and tbat lesson
demonstrates that coercion is not only
silly bnt is virtually impossible in Ameri
can politics.

McKINLEY'S
VIEWS.
The Republican Candidate
on the Pending
Issues.
"Out Contest Is for the Good Faith
of the Nation and the Wel
fare of the People."
In the last issue of the New York Inde
pendent Major McKiniey, in response to a
request from the editor of that journal,
give 9 his views on the pending issues of
the day. He says:
It is not possible for me to find time, in the
multiplicity of my other engagements, to
write anything tor publication in the Inde
pendent, or elsewhere, on the issues of the
pending National campaign. As you prob
ably know, I bave made numerous snort
speeches to visiting delegations here at my
home in Canton, aud if what follows, selected
from them, serves your purpose, or you think
it will be of interest to the readers of the Inde
pendent, you are at perfect liberty to publish
It in your excellent journal.
The Republican party stands for a reunited
aud prosperous country ; it stands for the
American factory, the American farm, the
American fireside'; for American labor, Ameri
can wages and American thrift throughout
every part oi our much loved land. It stands
for a protective tariff which protects every
American interest; it stands fora reciprocity
that reciprocatesâ that gets something for
what we give to the nations of the world. It
stands now, as it Has always stood,
and always will stand, for scuud money
with which to measure the exchange of
the people, for a dollar that is not only good
at home, but good in every market-place of the
world. It is with these principles emblazoned
on its banners, this ysar of 1896, that it ap
peals to the deliberate judgment oi the Ameri
can people.
The questions to be settled in the National
contest this year are as serious and important
as any of the great Governmental problems
that have confronted us in the past quarter
of a ceutury. They command our sober judg
ment and a settlement tree from partisan pre
judice and passion, beneficial to ourselves and
befitting the honor and grandeur of the Re
public. They touch every interest of our com
mon country. Our industrial supremacy, our
productive capacity, our business Â»nd com
mercial prosperity, our proud financial honor,
and our splendid free citizenship â the birth
right of every American â are all involved in
the pending campaiKU, and thus every home
in the land is directly and intimately con
nected with their proper settlement
Recent events have imposed upon a patri
otic people a responsibility and duty greater
than they have known since the Civil War.
Then it was a struggle to preserve the Govern
ment of the United Slates; now it is a struggle
to preserve the financial honor of the Govern
ment of the United States. Then it was a con
test to save the Union; now it is a contest to
save spotless its credit. Then section was ar
rayed against section ; now men of all sections
can unite, and will uniie, to rebuke the re
pudiation of our obligations and the debase
ment of our currency. In this contest patriot
ism is above party, and National honor dearer
than any party name.
It is proposed by one wing of the Democratic
party and its allies, tne People's and Silver
parties, to inaugurate the free and unlimited
coinage of silver, by independent action on
the part oi the United Stales, at a ratio of six
teen ounces of silver to one ounce of gold. The
mere declaration of this purpose is a menace
to our financial and industrial interests, and
has already created universal alarm. It in
volves a great peril to the credit and business
of the country, a peril so grave that conserva
tive men everywhere are breaking away from
their old party associations and uniting with
other pa riotic citizens in emphatic protest
against the platform of the Democratic Na
tional Convention as an assault upou the
faith and honor of the Government and the
welfare of the people.
The farmer could not be helped by the free
coinage of silver, because if the nominal price
ot grain were to rise through the inflation of
the currency the price ol everything else
would rise a. so and the farmer would be rela
tively no better off than he was beiore. He
would not get any more real value for his
grain than he gets now, and would suffer from
the general demoralization which woula fol
low free coinage. The farmer can only be
helped by more consumers ior his products;
he cannot be helped by free trade, but he can
be seriously hurt by tne free importation of
competingproducts into this country. Better
a thousand times enlarge the markets for
American products than enlarge our mints for
the silver product oi the world. You cannot
add value to anything by diminishing trie
measure of the vaiue with which the thing is
sold or exchanged.
If you can increase the value by lowering
the measure of value, and you want to benefit
the farmer, then muke the bushel smaller, the
pound lighter and declare a less number than
twelve a legal dozen. Free silver will not
cure over-production nor under-consumption.
Free silver will not remove the competition of
Russia, India aud the Argentine Republic.
Free silver will not increaÂ»e the demand for
wheat, or make a single new consumer. You
do not get new consumers through the minis;
you get them through the factories. You will
not get them by increasing the circulation of
cneap money in tue United States; you will
get mem by increasing the manufacturing es
tablishments in the United states.
Whatever the farmer is suffering to-day he is
suffering because his competitors have in
creased in numbers and his best customers are
out of work. Ido not know that we can de
crease the number oi his competitors, but
with the adoption of a true American protect
ive policy we can set his best customers to
work. We have suffered in our foreign and in
our domestic trade both during the past three
years. The home market is the best friend of
the farmer. It Is his best market, his only re
liable market, his own natural market. He
should be protected in its enjoyment by wise
tariff legislation and his home market should
not b. permitted to be destroyed by lessening
the demand for American labor and dimin
ishing the pay of American workingmen, aud
thereby diminishing the demand for agricul
tural products.
The Government of the United States must
raise enough money to meet both its current
expenses and increasing needs. Its revenue
should be .-o raised as to protect the material
interests of our people, with the lightest pos
sible drain upon iheir resources, and maintain
that iiigh standard of civilization which has
distinguished our country for more than a cen
tury of its existence. The credit of any Gov
ernment is imperiled so long as it expends
more money man it collects. The credit of the
Government, like that of the individual citi
zen, is best subserved by living withia its
meansand providing means with which tolive.
The complaint of the people is not against
the administration for borrowing money and
issuing bonds to preserve the credit of the
country, but against the ruinous policy which
has made this necessary. It is but an incident,
and a necessary one, to the policy which has
been inaugurated. The inevitable effect of
such a policy is seen in the deficiency of the
United Stales treasury, except as it is re
plenished by loans, and in the distress of the
people, who are suffering because of the scan t
demand foi either their labor or the products
of their tabor.
The future is the sacred trust of all, South as
well as North. Honesty, like patriotism, can
neither be bounded by State nor sectional
Hups. Sectionalism has given place to a true
National spirit, and patriotism has smoothed
the asperities of partyiam, until the preserva
tion of the National honor constitutes the
great aim and purpose of all patriotic American
citizens.
Our contest is for the good faith of the
Nation and the welfare ol the people, and we
can proclaim witn confidence the same
supreme faith in the people which upheld
Lincoln in every trial of the war. As hessid:
"Intelligence and patriotism, Christianity and
a firm reliance in him who has never yet for
saken tint favored land are still competent to
adjust in the best way all our preseni difficul
ties." Good citizenship lies at the foundation
of our true greatness as a free Government
and those who promote it are indeed Christian
teachers an<l public benefactors. The better
the citizen the better a free government and
the better its lairs.
HOW WAGES WOULD TUMBLE
Chicago Times- Herald.
Such a panic and such hard times as would
surely follow the adoption of tree silver and
the other revolutionary features of the Bryan
platform would not only stop the wages of
millions of laborers, but they would send the
wages of those who have work down to a point
lower than they have been at any period since
18G0.
American labor is too patriotic to risk revo
lution; it is too well informed to undo what it
has taken so long to accomplish â to adapt a
course that would send tumbling to a low
tisrure the good wages it now hasâ by lending
itself to the work oi electing a Pr-sident and
Congress on such a platform as that adopted
in Chicago last Juiy, at the dictation of Sena
tor Tillman. Governor Altgeld and the sil
ver-mine owners, who saw in success for
that platform profits to themselves to the tune
of scores of millions. Intelligent labor, such
as America has, may be fooled once in a while,
but not twice in a while.
Labor wants work and to maintain its wages ;
it doesn't want Bryan ana certain reduction ot
wagts Labor knows tnat it would take twenty
years to get back to present w*ges if the silver
mipe owners and the revolutionists have their
way in this campaign.

MISSES' AND GIRLS' CAPE.
For an all-round serviceable garment the
above is unrivaled. Made with a hood and
one cape, or with both capes and nood, it is
useful as well as becoming. Or it may be a
single cape with just a collar. When made
with both capes the hood may be joined to the
shorter one, the enllar finishing the latter.
Thus three garm nt of different weight are
solved, as either â¢ a .c may be worn separate,
while tor the coldrsi dÂ«ys both are worn.
Double-faced cloaking is extremely popular
for these garments, a plain color with bright
plaid'on the rev-rse being best liked.
When plain colors are used the hood may be
brightened by a lining of plaid or plain silk
of a gay color. The edges of the capes are
generally bound and turned in all around
about half an inch and firm.y stitched.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS.

and bearing. In some of his photographs he

Pianist.
a very accomplished virtuoso, though he will
not pose as a rival to the one and only Rosen
thai. He has been engaged by Frederick
Archer to appear with the Plttsburg Sym
phony Orchestra for two concerts on Novem
ber 6 and 7, and has also made a number of
other engagements. It is not yet stated
whether his tour will extend to the Pacific
Coast.
Tenors are so rare, says Le Figaro, that
when we have them, we want to keep them till
they are 90 years old. The excellent Duprez,
who has jusi died at that age, was the joy of
his own generation, but he has been the night
mare of succeeding generations. Whenever a
new tenor made his debut in Paris, the ama
teurs recalled Duprez, the great Duprez! In
vain the newcomer toiled and suffered, it wa3
always: "Ah, if you had heard Duprez in the
role!" And with that phrase, certain poor
devils who should have been encouraged were
entirely crushed. Even the people who had
never in their lives heard Duprez took up the
phrase, because they, too, thought it chic ana
knowing. It was a repetition of the old story of
the subscriber who went into the foyer, say
ing "Ah, Mario, sir; wnat a voice, what admi
rable timbre!"
"You have heard him ?"
"Yes; one evening in a restaurant. He was
ordering a tenderloin of sole."
It is a pleasure that we all seem to feel, the
pleasure of crushing people with the souvenirs
oi their predecessors. A man reaches celebrity;
he Delieves himself the first in his art, and in
a few words he is annihilated with: "Ah, if
you had heard Duprez." This has the appear
ance of honor rendered to the ancients; is it
not oftener a form of jealousy of newcomers?
Gilbert Duprez, the great tenor who has just
died in Paris, quitted the stage in 1851, but
most people who tase an interest in lyric art
have heard of him, partly through his book
"Souvenirs of a Singer." How many singers
have not taken heart again in reading the sad
history of his debut and his struggles and the
brilliant page of his ultimate success ! For ten
years he was the glory of the Paris Opera, and
his triumphs in Italy are a matter of mu-ical
history. It is said that no one has ever sung
the tenor role as he did in "La Favorita" and
"La Reine de Chypee." But Duprez did not
want to lag superfluous on the scene, and
when he felt his voice failing him he retired
from the stage and began teaching. The
greatest of his pupils was Mme. Mlolan-
Carvalho. While Duprez taught he composed
operas, but his numerous attempts in that line
were not successful. It is almost fifty years
since his Dest work "Joan of Arc" was pro
duced, and though he penned many other
compositions during his years as a maestro
they did not add to his fame. Duprez vas
born in 1806.
In his "Souvenirs of a Singer" ("Souvenirs
dun Chanteur"), Duprez tells this story of his
debut at the Paris Opera: "I knew that my
success could not come from my personal ap
pearance. A little incident just before the
final rehearsal took away ail illusion in that
regard. During an entr'acte de ballet Haievy
and I were walking arm in arm about the
theater, while some of the dancers wt-re prac
ticing their steps. One of them, a beautiful
figurante, stopped suddenly and looked at
us. 'What's that?' she asked a comrade, indi
cating me. 'He's the new tenor, who replaces
Nourritt; they say that he will bring down the
house.' 'Bah!' replied the figurante; 'that
toad; it is not possible. He's too ugly.'"
The popular American prima donna, Emma
Eames, has just delivered herself, with re
freshing smartness, on the subject of some of
the founders of her country. Having just re
turned from Italy to Paris to get ready for
another trip across the Atlantic, she was
sought by an interviewer, to whom she con
nded that she had been indulging in complete
idleness, neglecting everything and living
without a conscience. Having unsuccessfully
attempted to discover if the newspaper man
was possessed of such an article, she went on
in this style. "The New England conscience
is too dreadful, and whenever I have Deen told
stories of the privations of the pilgrim fathers
I have always said: 'Think ol the pilgrim
mothers. They had to put up with not only
the same tria.s and privations, but with the
pilgrim fathers as well." Rough on the fath
ers. Eh?
The last issue of the Bayreuther Blaetter
contains a letter from Frau Cosima Wagner,
addressed to Seckendorf and Muneker, presi
dent of the General Committee of Wagnerian
Associations. In this letter the widow of the
Bayreuth master expresses her gratitude to all,
both near and far, who have collaborated since
1876 in the workatÃtyreuth. The Bayreuther
BUetter also states mat in the answer to the
appeal for funds to assist poor artists in visit

ready been paid in, and tbat other subscrip

In Germany the thunders of justice fall on a
music critic who makes use of too t>ii turesque
language. It is thus that the music criae of
the Tagbiatt of Ulm has been condemned to a
fine of 30 marks by the tribunal oi Uim, be
cause he spoke irreverently in his paper of a
concert singer, as "a damsel who sings like a
rooater. " Tnis metaphor was certainly un
kind, and the critic mighthave expressed him
self in less vivid language, but the expression
carries with it no slur on the singer's reputa
tion. She would certainly not have com
plained if the critic had compared her to a
nightingale or a lark.
The inhabitants of Cardiff gave an almost

NATURE CONTURES THE BRYAN
ITRS
;/ â¢ Â_..: Philadelphia Ledger. , .W^Ki,
Nature herself seems to be working this year
to prevent the farmers of the United States
from committing the fatal folly of voting for
free silver. * The sharp advance in the price of
wheat, amounting to about 13 cents a bushel
in the last month, has confuted the assertion
of Bryan and his lieutenants that the previous
low price of grain was due to "the crime of
1873." and, though the campaign managers
are trying to make it appear that the present
rise is due to political machination, just as
they are trying to make people believe that
the armies oi visitors to Canton are all paid
by the Republican lenders, they cannot refute
the facts that the wheat crop in India and
Argentina have suffered greatly from drought,
that the crop in Russia is 40 per cent short,
and that the stock of wheat on hand in Liver
pool October 1 was less than one-fourth as
large as that on the corresponding date last
year. Theso are business reasons for the rise
which the farmers can understand, and they
are intelligent enough to see that the relative
value of silver has nothing to do with any of
them. _^_____________

pany Utterly De

CHINESE CONSUL ACCUSED.
Great Excitement Now Prevailsâ The
Matter to Bs Investigated by
Legal Talent
At about 10:30 yesterday morning a
human cyclone in the shape of several
white men armed with clubs struck the
rich and costly apartments of the See Yup
Company at 820 Clay street, leaving noth
ing but devastation in its wake. And now
a tumultuous complication has arisen, in
which the See Yup Company, the Sam
Yup Company, the law firm of Reddy,
Campbell Â«fc Metson, the police and the
Chinese Consul, Fung Wing Hong, are
mixed up.
At the time mentioned no Chinese were
on guard in tbe rooms of the company,
but one lone Celestial was standing in the
hallway. The invaders caught him by
the nape of the neck and the base of the
trousers and pitched him headlong down
the stairs, where he-hunted a safer clime.
Then the men began their work.
Costly vases were smashed to smither
eens, tables overturned and broken,
chairs reduced to kindling-wood, posters
torn from the walls, cuspidores over
turned on the carpeting, josses thrown
from their pedestals and trampled, tea
spilled over everything and a few lighter
articles cast into tbe hallway.
Nothing of any value was spared, ex
cept tbe clocks, of which there were three
on the walls, and the cut-glass chande
liers. Even the certificate of incorpora
tion of the See Yups, issued October 14,
1895, was torn from the wall, the glass
lront smashed and a large hole punched
in the document itself.
By the time the invaders had finished a
vast crowd of Chinese, extending into the
side streets, had gathered and were fran
tically jostling one another in an effort to
get near the scene of the trouble. Tbe
most eaeer of them, however, Kept at a
safe distance from the door.
Then tbe iconoclasts rushed down the
stairs and made off without tbe identity
of a single one being established. They
went straight to 10% Spoff >rd alley, where
a Chinese named Ding Hong Gok runs a
sort of boarding-house for cooks on war
vessels, and there proceeded to climb a
flight of stairs, break a marble-topped
table and tear several pictures irorn the
wall.
By a roundabout route the party went to
13 Waverly place and ascended to the third
floor, where tue Ping Kong Ting, or Chi
nese Free Mason's socieiy, is located in
rooms 48 and 51. Here the furniture was
again indiscriminately broken, the pic
tures removed from the wall and demol
ished and tbe certificate of incorporation,
issued May 5, 1896, knocked to pieces. Sev
eral valuable silk placards, made by some
notable Chinese dignitary and presented
to the society, were aiso ruined. These
cannot be replaced.
During tbe whole of the work of demoli
tion not a clew was obtained as to the
identity of the invaders. It was commonly
supposed at first by others than the Chi
nese themselves tbat Sergeant Price and
his Chinatown squad had made another
raid in anticipation of a carnival of blood*
shed on the part of tbe batchetmen.
Although Sergeant Price was seen in Chi
natown yesterday forenoon he and his
men vigorously deny that they had any
thing to do with the disturbance. In this
statement they are corroborated by sev
eral of Sergeant Anderson's men, who
state that the work was done by wholly
irresponsible parties.
At the time of the trouble Chief Crow
ley is reported to have been in the office of
Reddy, Campbell & Metson, the See Yup
Company's attorneys, who were endeavor
ing, in conjunction with the Chief, to
formulate some plan by which the late
murders that have so disgraced the City
might be prevented. On bearing of the
riotous proceedings in Chinatown the
head of the police force went up to see for
himself. He made no comments what
ever.
Attorney Campbell then went up in per
son and interviewed his Chinese clients
lor some time in tbe afternoon. All he
would say was that somebody will have to
pay dearly for their frolic. An emissary
of the firm was aiso present in the after
noon with a photographer, who took sev
eral views of tbe scene of devastation.
Loud threats were made by this gentle
man, who laid the whole blame of the oc
currence on tbe Chinese Consul, Fung
Wing Hong.
This theory of the Consul being the
cause of the irruption is the only one con
sidered tenable by the Chinese. They
assert tbat Fung Wing Hong his been an
active partisan in the See Yup-Sam Yup
boycott, and has always favored the lat
ter whenever he got a chance. They be
lieve ti at he hired the men to do the
work.
Dong Tyng, the Chinese Police Court in
terpreter, in conversation with a Call re
porter, made tbe statement that not long
ago the Consul offered Chief Crowley
$10,000 if he would use his influence to
lorce tbe See Yups to "let up" on their
weaker brethren. When Tyng found out
the vocation ot the person to whom he
bad been talking, he denied the truth of
wnat he had said. Afterward, Lee Won
Sue, the president of tne See Yup Com
pany, conhrmed what Tyng had asserted.
Ibat the Chief would entertain no such
idea is provftd by later events.
The persons connected with the Oriental
saloon, directly beneath the scene of the
trouble, claim to know none of those wbo
participated in the affair. According to
their story they did not even takb the
trouble to see what was going on.

EXPIRED IN PRISON.
A Man Supposed to Be Hrrman Gardes
Arrested as a "Drunk."
A middle-aged man of light complexion
who was arrested Tuesday afternoon for
drunkenness died in the City prison a few
minutes later, and his body was taken to
the Morgue.
In the man's pockets were a photograph
ot a little girl and a letter written in pen
cil to a newspaper, in the corner of which
was the address "H. Gardes, 221 Golden
Gate avenue."
Gardes was an educated man. He was
one time bookkeeper at the Yolo Mills,
and later opened a grocery in the Western
Addition. He got a divorce from his wife,
and after that went on occasional sprees
and lost his business. The photograph of
the little girl was apparently that of his
daughter. He was a man about 45 years
v: age.

BURGLAR CAUGHT
WITH A BICYCLE
He Had Stolen It From
Broker S. P. Holden's
Residence.
The Man Was George Orr, Who
Was Befriended by the
Broker.
A POLICEMAK'S VIGILANCE.
Orr Is Suspected of Being Implicated
in Recent Burg aries in the
Western Addition.
A man, who was arrested â¢ arly yester
day morning on the charge oi burglary, Is
suspected by the police of being impli
cated in several burglaries that have been
recently reported in the Western Addi
tion.
His Dame is George Orr, a laborer by
occupation and a native of Australia. He
is about 50 years of age and his appear
ance is far from prepossessing.
About 4 o'clock yesterday morning Po
liceman C. M. Barnes met Orr on Jackson
street, between Scott and Devisadero. Orr
had a bicycle witn him and Barnes being
suspicious from his appearance that it did
not belong to him questioned him and re
ceived evasive replies. Barnes placed him
under arrest and took him to the North
End station.
Orr finally admitted that the bicycle be
longed to S. P. Holden, broker, who lives
on Webster street, near Broadway, and
Berries, on going there, found that tbe
basement door had been forced open and
the bicycle stolen. A charge of burglary
was then entered against Orr, and later he
was removed to the City Prison.
About a month ago Orr was sent to Mr.
Holden by the British Benevolent Society,
and ho employed him doing odd jobs
about the house and garden. He re
mained in Mr. Hoklen's employment
about a week, and soon after he left a bi
cycle was missed from the basement.
Detectives Bee and Harper traced it to a
rawashopand Mr. Holden released it. It is
suspected '.hut Orr was the thief and that
he had returned yesterday morning to
steal it again and any other articles he
could conveniently carry away.
Orr, when seen in tho City Prison, said
he was walking along the street looking
for a place to sleep when he saw Holden's
baseme'it door open. Being familiar with
the place he thought he would mafce the
basement his sleeping-place.
"I took the bicycle," said Orr, "as I was
hard up. I was walking along the street
with the bicycle when the policeman held
me up, asking me where I got it. I did not
tell him then, but afterward told him it
belonged to Holden.
"I came here from Australia eight or
nine years ago. I never was arrested be
lore, except once, about six months ago,
for vagrancy."
Orr's statement about never having been
arrested before is not in accordance with
facts. About nine years ago he was ar
rested lor stealing overcoats from the Pal
ace and other hotels and got six months
on each of two charges. He was then
Known as William Orr, alias George Camp
bell. Detective Bainbridge at once recog
nized him when he saw him in tbe prison.
It was rumored that Orr had broken into
the residences of Police Commissioner Al
vord and Dr. Charles R. Brigbam, but
both gentlemen denied that a burglary
had taken place on their premises.
AGGIE ABBOTT REMANDED.
Her Conviction for Grand Larceny Will
Stand.
The motion for a new trial for Aegie
Abbott, convicted of grand larceny for
stealing a watcb and money from John
Ellis in a Barbary Coast dive, was yester
day denied by Judge Bahrs and October
17 set as tbe day when sentence will be
passed on her.
The Abbott woman was to have been
sentenced on Saturday last, but her attor
torney presented an affidavit signed by
William Robles, who is confined in the
County Jail on a charge of vagrancy, set
ting forth that he committed the crime of
which the prisoner was accused.
When Rubles appeared in court yester
day he was asked to point out the man
whom he robbed, and instead of indicating
Ellis picked out a juror named Meyer.
Robles is an opium fiend, and came into
court weak and trembling from need oi
the drutf. When he .'ailed to identify EIII3
Judge Bahrs dismissed the motion for a
new trial and remanded Aggie Abbott for
sentence.
Assistant District Attorney Piexotto an
nounced his intention of having Robles
indicted for perjury.
A GARDENER RUNS AMUCK
Daniel Carr Armed With Two Revol
vers Causes a I'd ic.
Daniel Carr, a Hardener, 35 years of age,
caused considerable excitement in the
neignborhood of First and Harrison
streets last night and is now in the City
Prison charped with assault to murder.
About 7 o'clock Policeman Van Kenren
heard a shot in the direction of First
street, near Harrison. He ran there and
saw a crowd of men, women and children.
They told him to look out, as a man was
across the street with a revolver in each
hand and he was driving everybody away
by threatening to shoot.
Van Keuren ran across the street and
saw Carr walking along First street toward
Folsom. He followed him and came
within fifty feet of him when ho reached
Folsom and Second streets. Van Keuren
ordered Carr to drop his pistols, but he
wheeled round and leveled both at tbe
policeman, who drew his revolver.
Pete Wilson, a steamboat fireman,
rushed to Van Keuren's assistance. He
told Van Keuren to keep Carr covered
and he would Tapple with him. Wilson
dashed rast Van Kenren and just then
Carr fired a shot. Tbe bullet entered
Wilson's right thigh, but it did not deter
the plucky fireman from grappling with
him. Van Keuren also sprang upon him
and both pistols were wrenched from him.
He fouglit like a madman and was not
overpowered and manacled till Policemen
GEORGE ORR.
Riley and Gorman took a hand in the

At the meeting of the Board of Railroad
Commissioners yesterday a long communi
cation was received from Attorney-General
Fitzgerald in answer to the board's request
for information on several points, most
important of which waÃ the right of the
commission to fix the rate of charges on
the Market-street Railway. In close com
pany with this was a query as to the right
of the boftrd to punish Joseph L. Wlll
cntt. secretary of the Market-street Rail
way Company, for contempt, in his hav
ing failed to respond to a.subpena and
appear before the board, bringing the
books of the company. In answer to
these questions the Attorney-General as
sumes that tbe board has taken measures
to bring the matter before the courts, as
he previously advised them to do, and so
withholds his opinion on the ground that
it would serve no good purpose. If all the
preliminary moves have been made, he
says, he will proceed at once to prepare a
petition for a writ of mandate for the pur
pose of bringing the question of the right
of the board to reguiate the fares of tbe
Market-street Company to an early deter
mination. This, he says, is tbe proper
way to proceed.
He further says that in his opinion the
board bas the right to punish for con
tempt in the same manner and to the
same extent as courts of record, but he
advises against the exercise of that right
in this case until it is determined that
they have the right to regulate the fares
of the company.
In this matter the board will act at once
in accordance with the advice.
In answer to the question as to the right
of the board to determine tbat bicycles
must be rated and carried by transporta
tion companies as baggage, the Attorney-
General said there was nothing in the laws
of the State permitting them to do so.
What is or what is not baggage, he says,
is a mixed question, affected by circum
stances.
Finally, the Attorney-General says, in
answer to a fourth question, that the
board has the power and it is its duty to
regulate the charges for freight and pas
sengers of steamboat lines doing business
within the State, and advises tbe board
that it may summon the officers of these
companies and compel them to bring their
books and papers before it.
The secretary of the board was instructed
to prepare all the necessary papers as sug
gested by the Attorney-General in all the
several matters.
In tbe matter of the complaint of G.
Arnold of San Diego against tbe Southern
California Railway Company, praying
that the board declare that said company
has forfeited its right to operate its line
through Temecula Canyon, the petition
was denied.

THE CORNERSTONE OF THE MASONIC HOME LAID
The laying of the cornerstone of the
Masonic Home for Widows and Orphans,
which took place at Decoto yesterday, was
an event of much importance in the his
tory of Freemasonry in California.
The significant act of placing the stone
was accompanied by pageant, by oratory
and music, and was observed by thou
sands of Freemasons of all ranK6 and by
members of the Order of the Eastern Star,
gathered from all the counties, nearly all
the communities and representing about
all the ladies and all the grand bodies of
Freemasonry in California.
The events were fourfold. The first was
an impressive parade from the Masonic
Temple down Market street and in their
parade there were between 3000 and 4000
persons, bands of music, waving banners
and flags, glittering swords, nodding
plumes, costly and elegant regalia,
thousands of wearers of the "lambskin"
apron, in short all tbe paraphernalia,
equipment and outward glory of the great
order of Masonic brotherhood.
The second event was the parade at
Decoto, which was not a repetition albeit
the organizations taking part were the
same. But the surroundings were so dif
ferent and characteristic as to endow ttiis
second parade with characteristic and
unique interest.
The third event was the actual laying of
the cornerstone, which was viewed by
thousands who had not seen the parade in
San Francisco, but who had come in from
oil over Alameda and Santa Clara counties
in special trains, in carriages, on horse
back and on bicycles, taking any anil all
available means of conveyance to reach
the scene of such widespread interest.
Then came the fourth event, when the
members of tbe craft being called from
rest to refreshment devoted their atten
tion solely to a barbecue, which had been
prepared and served by Alameda Lodge,
fcwords rattled under the greenwood tree
in a grove surrounding the Decoto public
school. Spoons and forks jingled and
barbecued steers smoked on iong tables,
the generous length of which was calcu
lated to accommodate 1000 Masons and
friends at one sitting.
At 9:30 the procession began to move
down Market street en route for the Pied
mont, which was waiting to move the
Masons on the first stage of their eastward
journey. At the head of the line marched
Â£. Peabody, the grand marshal, and im
mediately "behind him were his aids â C. L.
Field, representing Golden Gate Com
mandery No. 16, K. T. ; W. H. F. Titus,
representing California Commandery No.
1, K. T. ; H. A. Cline, representing the
Grand Consistory ; Charles W. Conlisk,
representing San Jose Commandery, K. T. ;
WebD N. Pearce, representing Oakland
Commandery, K. T., and Henry Bruner,
P. M. Occidental No. 21.
The First Regiment band, playine lus
tily and gayly, beaded the officers of the
Grand Commandery, to which California
and Golden Gate commanderies, the Grand
Council R. and S. M., tne Grand Chapter
K. A. M. and the Grand Consistory acted
as escort. These bodies mitht be "termed
the. first division of tbe procession, and
they formed that portion which, with its
ewords, regalia and paraphernalia, was
tbe most showy and was representative of
the higher orders of the craft. There
were tylers with drawn swords, stewards
with rods and other officials of less rank.
The sun burnished their glittering gar
ments. They marched handsomely and
proudly.
Next came the "working Masons," the
members of the blue lodges, the represen
tatives of the great merciful and fraternal
army of Free and Accepted Masons, to
whom, in the personality of the officers of
the Grand Lodge of California, was con
signed the consecration of the corner
stone. So impressive a spectacle has sel
dom been seen on the streets of San
Francisco. Rank after rank, hundreds
after hundreds, reaching thousands of Free
and Accepted Masons in the aggregate,
moved steadily forward in pursuance of
their mission of mercy and benevolence.
The iong line stretched away block after
block, nearly a half mile in length. The
white-aproned Masons marched in fours.
First came the officers of the Grand
Lodgeâ Grand Master E. M. Preston,
Deputy Grand Master William T. Lucas,
Senior Warden Thomas Flint Jr., Junior
Warden F. M. Angelotti, Senior Deacon
W. M. Petrie, Junior Deacon Ralph
Lowe, Grand Secretary George Johnson,
Grand Treasurer Edward Coleman, Grand
Orator Voorsanger, Grand Chaplain E.
Walk, Grand Marshal Edward F. West,
Grand Standard-bearer H. A. Powell,
Grand Lecturer W. E. Sloan, Grand
Sword-bearer Keys.^Grand rursuivant J.
B. Cooke, Grand Organist Sam D. Mayer,
Grand Tyler J. Ogles by, Grand Bible
bearer J.B. Richardson and the lesser
officers, all being invested with the due
insignia of rank.
The delegates to the Grand Lodge, F.
and A. M. of California, and the large
membership of the lodges of this jurisdic
tion followed. Bands played, flags and
banners waved and tne gathering crowd
on Market street, which had been at
tracted by the mu*ic and the great out
pouring of Freemasons, became a dense
mass of spectators at several points along
the line of marcn. It is creditable to the
craft that hundreds whose business would
not permit them to visit Decoto neverthe
less donned tte "lambskin" apron and
swelled the demonstration by marching to
the foot of Market street. Many members
of the consistory, chapter, council and
commandery marched with the lodges.
The steamer Piedmont, when she pulled
out of the slip at the foot of Market street,
was simply packed with the Free Masons,
members of the order of the Eastern Star
and their friends. There was little room
to move about. There was comparatively
little delay in starting the trains when
tbe boat reached the Oakland mole, but as
usual, the number of passenger coaches
supplied was inadequate and many
Masons were compelled to stand all the
way to Decoto. California Commandery,
K. T., had a string of Pullman cars which
had been secured in advance. The first
train whirled through OaKland and by
other stations without stop, leaving Oak
land Free Masons to come on c train which
followed soon after.
San Jose Commandery, K. T., was found
to be drawn up in line at Decoto to re
ceive the visitors, making a fine appear
ance. Some delay occurred at Decoto be
fore the procession was fully re-formed, it
being necessary to await the arrival of the
second train. When finally the proces
sion was again ready to move it included
the Oakland and San Jose Commanderies
and a large delegation of Free and Ac
cented Masons from Alameda and Santa
Clt*ra counties. The line of march led
over a wide and almost level plain,
through inclosed fields and over a smooth
and wide road for some distance. Then
the road climbs the height upon which
tbe Masonic Home will stand, reaching
the crest by winding over a comparatively
gentle grade.
As the march was resumed with the
bands playing, the spectacle was very in
spiriting. The Masons were marching al
most due east, and before them rose a
range of high and fertile hills, the most
conspicuous~of which is Mission Peak,
some distance awÂ«ty. The hills framed
the picture very prettily on one side.
What had been impressive in the proces
sion before was doubly so now, for from
the heights upon which the spectators had
gathered the entire line with its varied
colors and fluttering pennnns was in view
at once. A large band of cattle, inspired
by curiosity as the bands played, twice
ran as if to break in upon the line, but
both times they were driven back by the
cowboys, who were at hand.
When the procession reached the hills
It doubled upon itself marching over the
curved upward road. Not less than 3000
tpectators were above them, looking down
upon the marching masses. There were
women with children in tlieir arms, who
bad climbed the steep in the warm
tuaabiue, carrying up their children

bodily that they might not miss the sight.
All ages and conditions of mankind
seemed to be represented amply, ana the
liveliest interest was manifested. Indeed,
the method of manifesting interest was a
little troublesome in one respect.
On the crest of the hill where the Ma
sonic Home will stand the objects which
were especially conspicuous yesterday
were the cement foundations defining the
outlines of the base of the building to be
first erected and a derrick ornamented
with an American flag. The derrick was
at the northeast corner of the outlines of
the home and from it was suspended the
square cornerstone, ready to be lowered
into position. The cornerstone on its
front bore this sculptured inscription :
MASONIC
â¢ Oct. utt, â¢
1896.
HOME.
A platform capable of accommodating
comfortably from 400 to 500 spectators had
been erected at the north end of the
structure to be, and this was equipped
with tables and a large number of chairs.
When the procession reached the height
these seats and about all the standing
room had been occupied. It was neces
sary to press the crowd back and place a
line of Uniformed Knights Templar as a
cordon of guards to keep the eager crowd
from encroaching upon the space reserved
for the grand officers of the Grand Lodge
of California.
The Grand Lodge officers passed oe
tween a double row of Knights Templar,
drawn up with drawn swords, as they
marched to the platform. All along the
eastern line of the building were the
Masons standing at rest. The varied uni
forms, the flags arid banners, etc., were
set off by the light-colored summer
fabrics which were worn by the hundreds
of ladies in attendance upon tbe proceed
ings. Their presence had been facilitated
by the means placed at their disposal by
the brethren of Alameda County, who
provided free buses and carriages to take
them to tbe foot of the hills.
The grand officers of the Grand Lodge
took their positions around a table, which
was covered with an American flag, and
the ceremony of laying tne cornerstone
went on.
First the Masonic choir saug, "The Lord
Is In His Holy Temple." Then Grand
Chaplain Walk offered prayer, in which
he alluded to the home to be provided for
the homeless, and the spirit of true pbil
anthropjf actuating the Masonic body in
their undertaking. "So mote it be," said
all the Free Masons in unison when the
prayer was done.
The audience then joined the Free
Masons in the singing of a Masonic ode,
to the tune of "America," the first stanza
of the ode being as follows:
Hall, Masonry divine!
Glory of ages, sblne
While time shall last!
Where'er thy vot'ries are,
Let love anil peace be there;
Let thy good works compare
With ages past.
Near the cornerstone were gathered the
board of trustees of tbe home, who are
the following named: Charles L. Patton
of San Francisco, president; Charles F.
Crocker of San Francisco, vice-president;
N. Greene Curtis, P. G. M., of Sacramento;
William Johnstone, P. G. M., of Sacra
mento; F. M Angelotti, J. G. W., of San
Rafael; Jacob Voorsanger, grand orator,
of San Francisco: W. Frank Pierce of
Oakland; George Hinds of Los Angeles;
Edwin Whipple of Decoto. When the ode
had been sung, Charles L. Patton, the pres
ident of the board of trustees, came for
ward to deliver a brief address, which was
as follows:
"Most Worshipful Grand Master,
Brothers and Friends: We have assem
bled here to-day to complete the founda
tion of a building, which work will mark
the highest manifestation of the sublime
principles of Free Masonry.
"Here, upon this spot_in the midst of
this beautiiul and fertile valley, will be
erected a home for aged and indigent
Masons, their widows and orphans, and
here, in the time to come, will tbe orphans
of our brethren be supported, educated
and prepared for the battle of life. Here
will the Mason's widow find shelter from
the want and misery which claim so many

C L. PATTON, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the "Widows'
and Orphans' Home.
for their own, and here will our own aged
and indigent be protected from the chill
ing neglect too often the fate of the old.
"The magnificent structure here to be
established will, in future, stand as a last
ing monument of the practical charity of
the craft. It will convince the world that
Masonry has a just title to the pre-emi
nence it has among tbe orders of the
world.
"It is unnecessary at this time to enter
into a history of the movement which has
culminated in this successful demonstra
tion. The brethren of the craft have full
knowledge of all the steps taken by the
board of trustees toward building this
house.
"The foundation haying been success
fully completed it remains for me to in
vite you as most worshipful grand master
to now proceed to the laying of the corner
stone of this edifice, to the erection of
which your labors in tbe past as president
of the board have contributed in a large
measure, and for that purpose I now pre
sent yon with this implement with which
to perform this work, and request that
you may retain it as a souvenir of this
important occasion."
The trowel, which was presented to
Grand Master Preston, is of silver with an
ivory handle. Upon the trowel were Ma
sonic symbols and the words: "Presented
by the Board of Trustees to Edward Mey
ers Preston at the laying of the corner
stone of the Masonic Widows' and
Orphans' Home at Decoto, October 14,
1896." Grand Master Preston received
this, and returned thanks neatly, expres
sing the hope that tbe trowel may be em
blematic oi the spreading of the balm of
brotherly love. He spoke as follows:
"The Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted
Masons and members of the Masonic fra
ternity from every portion of its jurisdic
tion, have assembled here to-day to be
present at the ceremonies which are to
constitute the official; beginning of that
structure which is to be erected on this
spot as a haven of rest for the aged and toil
worn Mason â an asylum for the destitute
widowâ a home for the helpless orphan.
"In the beautiful language of our ritual,
we are taught that 'To relieve the dis
tressed is a duty incumbent on all men,
particularly on Masons.' 'To soothe the
unhappy, to sympathize with their mis
fortunes, to compassionate their miseries
and to restore peace to their troubled
minds is the great aim we have in view.'
"In the construction of this Masonic
home we build not for ourselves, but for
the destitute and helpless; nut for gain,
bat for charity; not for to-day, but for the
future.
"This enterprise is purely a labor of
love, from which you who are interested
with its management and those who con
tribute to its construction and mainten
ance can hope for no beneSt nor reward
except the heartfelt thanks and fervent
blessings of the afflicted who shall rind
within its walls rest, sustenance and a
home.
"Labors in the cause of afflicted human
ity which, like these, depend for their suc
cess on the self-sacrificing efforts of their
promoters, serve to exemplify the noblest
attributes of humanity.
"No words of mine can add lustre to the
fraternal love wbich has conceived, the
skill which has designed and the charity
which has endowed this beneficent under
taking. Acts of charity and labors of love
are the very inspiration of eloquence in
their inception. They are Godlike in their
fulfillment. May such fulfillment be
speedily accomplished in the early com
pletion and endowment of this home.
"Mr. President, in compliance with your
invitation tbe Grand Lodge will now pro
ceed with the ceremonies of the laying of
the cornerstone."
Mrs. L. N. Tobin clayed, with band ac
companiment, a trombone solo, receiving
much applause. Then toe grand officers
clustered around the cornerstone, after
the grand master had notified the grand
senior warden and the grand senior war
den had notified the grand junior warden,
and the grand treasurer had been told in
turn of the nature of the duties to be per
formed in connection with placing tne
cornerstone in position.
The following-named articles, in a sealed
metallic ca-tet, were placed in the cor
nerstone:

ject of the home, the order by which it
was projected, the date of the laying of
the cornerstone and the names of the trus

master stood in tbe east, the deputy grand
master at the north, tbe senior grand war
den at the west and the junior grand
warden at the south. When tbe metallic
box was placed in thp cornerstone the
Masonic choir sang "Place We Now the
Cornerstone" and the grand master
prayed.
At the conclusion of the ode the work-
ing tools were distributed among the
grand officers by Architect Little, the
trowel to the grand master, the square to
the deputy grand master, tbe level to the
senior grand warden and the plumb to
the junior grand warden. The corner
stone was lowered into position
when Grand Master Preston commanded.
As it descended the grand officers paid
homage to it. The grand master spread
mortar on the stone with his trowel.
Then the other principal officers applied
the square, level and plumb in succession,
and after due announcement the grand
master gave the stone three blows with
his gavel, and declared that the work had
been well done. Then the vessels of corn,
wine and oil were poured on the stone by
the deputy grand master, senior grand
warden and junior grand warden, prayers
following that the Great Architect may
"bountifully vouchsafe the corn of nour
ishment," that "during their intervals
from labor the craftsmen may continually
be blessed with that refreshment of which
wine is emblematical," and that "our
loved fraternity may long exist to pour
forth tbe oil of joy upon the hearts of the
widowed the fatherless and tbe dis
tressed."
The grand master offered prayer and
placed tbe working tools in the hands of
the architect, praying that he might per
form the work not only to the satisfaction
of those who intrusted him with its fulfill
ment but in such manner as shall secure
tbe approbation of his own conscience and
redound to the credit of the ancient craft.
The choir sang another ode and then Rev.
Dr. Voorsnnger, the grand orator, pro
nounced an eloquent oration.
Most worshipful grandmaster and brethren,
ladies and gentlemen: Thrice happy is he
whose footsteps led him this day to this
favored spot in the sunny Contra Costa hills.
Thrice happy he who. with us, may witness
tnis sacred consummation of hopes long de
ferred, of prnyers long unanswered, of wishes
long unrealized. We stand on the hilltops
o'erlookiug our domain, every foot of which
speaks of faith, hope and charity. We stand
at the closed groove, iv which is sunk the key-
Etoue, noble symbol of patient faith kept alive
by the love of our brethren. We stand aloft,
gazing on the rich valleys of this dear, dear
land; we watch the silver lines of the waters
beyond, we watch these kindly laces, beaming
with pleasure at the niitillment of this holy
task, and, surely, our first thought isâ God is
good; the master who steels the arm for the
sowing time permits us to stand on the thresh
ing floor and sing our song of praise !
Brethren, this is a sacred hour. Well may
we tarry to learn its lessons. There are few
such periods in our busy lives. Usually we
grapple with problems that often remain un
miswered until we have gone our last journey.
W^e. hanker nfter power, riches, glory ; we il
lusfrate, in the mighty weakness of our re
puted strength, the unhallowed selfishness of
our ambitions and desires. Life is a battle
field strewn with the corpses of unsatisfied
one, conquest to the other. ..
We live to conquer; to reach the goa^n the
mighty race ior power and fame to set _ our
foot on the neck of the vanquished This we
call success, forgetting that there Â»Â» â¢ â¢ e h B
ure with which all are measured-a *c ytne
for others. We descend into the ocean of ob
livion; its waters engulf us, and on the shore
stand new generations â¢W"Â»Â» 1I }?., w ouderingl>,
the time, when they, too, shall follow. \\ hat
remains' Faith remains, nope abides ana
charity, also-^nd the greatest of these is char
"xhis is not the hour for glorification, but for
Humility; not for praise of men, but of the su
preme Grand Master. This is not the hour to
extol our success, but to deliberate the potency
01 greater effort. For, brethren, in Betting : this
cornerstone iv its socket the thought grows on
us that the inmates of the home that shall
here be erected are the very cripples who ha vt
been shot to pieces on life's battlefieid. When
we think of them, the flush of success disap
pears from our countenances, for we begm to
think, not of what we have achieved, but oi
what we owe them ; not of our own poor glory,
but of the responsibility that life's battle puts
on them who have stayed in the fight to win
and prevail. Â _,
Here are to dwell orphans and widows. The
providence of God might with unquestioned
justice have willed that your wives, your chil
dren should be cherished here- There is, in
spite of the most unselfish humanity, a touch
of humiliation in public support. They who
need Hare the maimed, the cripples, the help
less, the lallen. How much have we for which
to be grateful? How deeply moved to grati
tude must we not be when we come to realize
the great privileges vouchsafed us, that we
may remove this touch of humiliation from
the hearts of all who here will see* shelter be
neath the wing of Masonry?
And this inclines me to say to you, brethren,
that probably this very teaching of humility
is the first lesson in Masonic philosophy. We
cannot wholly conquer the selfishness of our
natures, but we can strive to infuse mercy
into life* battle. If we must war against one
another, let us, after the manner of modern
warfare, dolled the maimed after tne battle
and heal their wounds. We owe it to our
selves.
It is, it should be, an expression of our hu
mility, a recognition of the fact tnat, if the
race belongs to the swift, God gives strength
to the one and weakness to the other. To me
the great beauty of Masonry is, and always
has been, that it sets forth the relations be
tween God and man, the duty man owes *,o his
God and his neighbor. Masonry preaches the
ideal 01 fraternity, and preaches in bold, home
spun language the theory that this warefare
oi man against man is wrong; that brother
hood is a nobler ideal than manhood, that
amity is nobler than strife, that humanity is
holier than the success of life.
Masonry teacbes that there is a democracy
of spirits before God, in which not the mail
clad warrior, but the righteous man, not the
wise, learned scholar, but the lover of his fel
low-man, shall be priest and ruler. In that
democracy, as the spirit of Masonry interprets
it, the classes and divisions of man are as
naught in the face oi the eternal verity, that
God hath made all men of the same dust, hath
endowed them all with the capacity of suffer
ing'and hath ordained for them a common
destiny, eternal rest for their weary frames,
eternal light for their beatified spirits in the
lustrous realms above, where the Supreme
Master oi the Universe forever presides.
That thought of a common origin and a
common destiny humbles the Mason before
the Great Light the East, but strengthens
his spirit to see wherein man departs from
the great wisdom of the ages. That thought
of the democracy of spirits levels, within Ma
sonry, all classes and conditions. All are
alike before the Supreme, tbe master and the
apprentice, he who sits in the flood of ori
ental light and he who gropes in darkness, he
who wields the scepter and he who obeys
orders, he who commands and he who toils.
Banded and linked together by the power^of
that leveling principle, duty receives a differ
ent interpretation. There may be a palace
for the one and a hovel for the other, but the
denizens ot the palace must know the fate of
him who dwells in the poor man's hut; they
are responsible to one another, foi Goa has
made them alike; they share a common des
tiny; both live, and both suffer, and bota
shall die, and both shall live again.
Brethren, we are responsible to one another,
and unless that link 01 responsibility holds
us together Masonry Is not worth a thought.
Rich and poor, learned and unlearned, strong
and weak, high and low, these are the nomen
clatures of life's battle, representing the vic
tor and the conquered, the sound in body and
the maimed, we know them not in Masonry.
We are a democracy, standing before the Su
preme Grand Master, girt with but one arma
ment, uniform to all, the armament of virtue,
of character and ot good deeds !
That is our creeu. He who hath a better to
offer let him step forward and improve the
ideal, which is the design of God himself.
And now, since we are thus constituted, with
a firm belief in the justice of equality, we ren
der no humiliating service to the families of
our brethren who have departed on their last
journey â we do but honor ourselves, we do
but justice to ourselves, when we provide this
shelter for them. Charity is kind, but the
word charity is not so Masonic as the word
justice I We do justice to our orphans, to our
widows, when we remove them into surround
ings where they may witness the strength of
our teachings. It is justice to give them
shelter, justice to clothe them, justice to edu
cate, justice to love them !
And now, all hail to the Grand Lodge of Cal
ifornia, mother of noble institutions, protect
ress of nonorable entemries. sacred teacher of
our Masonic manhood. All hail to the vener
able exponent of Masonry in California, be
neath whose protecting hnnd we are per
mitted to consecrate this place to humanity.
In it the traditions of Masonry live again.
Called into life in the days of gold, its wisdom
sought permanence amid the coming and go
ing of gold loving wayfarers and secured a
home for Masonic teachings on the western
shore; its strength supported its youne ap
prentices until they became masters, whom
California did and does delight to honor, and
Its beauty attracted the noble youth, whom it
taught the grand lessons of speculative Ma
sonry.
And these lessons, are they really the
esoteric knowledge the world may not know?
Two words constitute both its ritual and its
philosophy. To the Mason the Delphic oracle
contained no mystery. Know thyself. That,
is the sum of our teachings. Knowing is act
ing, doing. Therefore we give honor to our
fraternity, our Grand Lodge, the venerable
and worshipful brethren who constitute its
leaders and teachers, for that we are per
mitted, under heaven's blessing, to illustrate
our self-knowledge by an act of unselfishness
that shall redound not to our glory, but to tbe
glory of him whom Masons worship, the Su
preme Architect, to whose divine care we
commit the designs of our architects, the
labor of our crafts and the success of this
noble enterprise. Most worshipful grand
master, I thank yon.
The Masons ana the audience joined in
singing the doxology. The grand chap
lain offered a final prayer. Then the pro
cession formed for the third and last time
and marched to the grove, where the big
barbecue had been prepared.
Tbe grove where the barbecue was held
was speedily made lively. Nearer 6000
than 1000 came who fed. The tables were
bountifully provided, but they were cleared
off rapidly and had to be replenished
several times. Knights, Scottish Rite
Blue Lodge and order of the Eastern Star
were all mixed up in delightful and
sociable confusion at the long parallel
tables. Formality was at a discount*
jollity, joy and thankfulness was the rule
everywhere. Congratulations were ex
changed on all sides upon the success
which had attended the ceremonies, which
in attendance, favoring weather and in
trinsic interest lacked for nothing that
could have been desired.
A programme of toasts had been partly

by proposing "three cheers for John L.

providing this barbecue." The cheers

First Day of the Great
California- Australia
Match.
Most Perfect Display of the
Game Ever Seen in
This City.
OVER A THOUSAND SPECTATORS
The California Boys Making a Credit
able Standâ A Banquet Giyen
the Visitors.
If any one among the many who have
claimed that the game of cricket was and
always would be a despised sport in this
country happened to witness tbe opening
of the great California-Australia match
yesterday he must thins differently to
day. The grand stand of the Presidio
athletic grounds was densely packed, and
from long before the opening of the game
and until the stumps were pulled the
greatest enthusiasm was evinced.
It was announced weeks in advance that
the local players were to try odds with the
strongest combination of cricketers that
had ever set foot in America. It was
known tbat the expected team bad won
19 out of 34 matcbes against the strongest
eleven in England ; that in New York,
Philadelphia and Chicaeo they had had a
simple "walkover." But it remained to be
seen what California, which has been an
unknown quantity in cricket circles, could
do when on her mettle.
Fifteen hundred or more people, bow
ever, were interested enough in this
question to assemble on the grounds,
knowing that in any event they would see
cricket at its best. Besides the most
prominent English residents, who alone
on former events of the kind have inter
ested themselves in the game, there were
hundreds of baseball adherents and others
to whom cricket was before a myth. And
they stayed ail day, too â stayed and en
joyed, most evidently, the wonderful bat
ting, bowling and fielding feats presented.
It was an ideal day, and as tbe sun shone
on ibe bright array of smartiy attired
ladies and picturesquely uniformed ath
letes a most festive scene was presentod.
Owing to managerial hitches it was al
most noon before tbe two four-horse
coaches bearing the distinguished visitors
drew up at the entrance. Play was
shortly commenced, however, and the
ever-increasing crowd was soon appeased

by the brilliant batting performances of
the Australians. At first it seemed as
though the Californians would never dis
miss the giants, the stand made by Griffin
and Darling being particularly ominous.
But alter lunch the title turned. The side
was disposed of for 193, and tbe local play
ers opened their innings. They have now
twenty runs to their credit, with eleven
wickets to fall. Play will be resumed to
day at 10 a. M. precisely.
Tbe Game.
Captain W. Robertson of the local team won
the toas and sent the visitors in. The first
representatives to face the bowlers (Robertson
and Cooper) were H. Donnan and J. Darling.
Robertson opened with a wide. In the second
ball of the next over Robertson bowled Don
nan at two runs with a neat leg break. One
lor 12.
Darling was than joined by Giflen. The last
ball of this over was driven for 4 by Darling. A
neat single by Giflen was the first scored off
Cookson. The latter marred an otherwise
good over with a wide. Iv the next over Dar
ling sent Robertson to the distant fence for
4- Butt in the next made a great field at long
off. Glffen got three fours off Robertson. It
was an expensive over and was offset by a good
one by Cookson.
Sloman was now put on In Robertson's place.
His first over cost one run. Two sharp fields
by Butt and another tn the next over Dy Sewell
.raised applause. Fifty up.
4 Sloman waanow hit all over the ground with
I the greatest of cane. Eighty and ninety were
I'oon put on the board. Dickinson relieved
It oman.
Both Dicrlnson and Ward were now being
played with consummate ease, but they were
not hit about as their predecessors had been.
Ward got another maiden over, after which
the team retired for lunch with the score at
ninety-nine.
Robertson took the bowling on the reium
A VERY REMARKABLE DOCUMENT
Citizens' Non-Partisan Legislative Candidates Modify Their
Pledges on the Charter.
To the Chairman and Members of the Citizens' Non-Partisan Committee: The under
signed, after a conference had for that purpose, beg leave, in fairness to themselves
and to you, to submit the following:
At the time of our nominations for Senators and Assemblymen in the respective
Senatorial and Assembly districts, set out after our individual names, we were
requested to sign a pledge tbat we would vote for the new charter in the Legislature,
if the same was carried by tbe vote of San Francisco. After mature consideration
we are ali of the opinion tbat the pledge as signed was inadvisedly taken, aad should
be modified to tbe extent that Assemblymen and Senators as to their votes in the
Legislature should be guided entirely by tbe vote of their constituents on the charter
in their respective Senatorial and Assembly districts.
The pledge as so modified is satisfactory to us. Without the modification we
most respectfully notify you that we cannot indorse it.
Hoping that you may see the fairness and justness of our modification and that
you may see your way clear to limit the original pledge in that regard, we have the
honor to be, respectfully, yours truly,

ing of play and started off with a maiden over.
Ward followed with similar success. In the
next over Giffien succumbed 1. b. w. to a oall
of Kobertson'o, He had made forty-three.
Two wickets for ninety-nine. Clem Hill
joined Darling and singles and twos com
menced passing the century. Robertson was
now bowling in better form and the runs came
slowly. Cookson took Ward's end and led off
weSL In the firstball of his second over he got
Hill with a beauty. Three for 105, Hill 12.
Then Gregory went in and made two on the
last ball of the over. In the riext over Robert
son got Darling at 57, 1. b. w. Captain Trott
joined Gregory. Four for 114. Gregory very
uarrowlv escaped being run out, owing to a
bad return by Moriarty. Two overs later,
Gregory, with three runÂ§. played one of Robert
son's on to his wicket. Five lor 115. Graham
joined Trott. He opened with a single on the
slips. Simmonds let pass an easy cut of Gra
ham's, which cost 4, and made the total 120.
A grand oft cut for 4 by Trott, off Cookson,
was the feature of the next over. Three overs
later 130 was up. The next 10 were made by
twos and threes. Then Graham lifted Cookson
over the fence for 6. Simmonds missed an
easy cat(sh put up by Grahamâ lso up. The
next bali Trott was magnificently caught on
the deep field by Hogue. Six for 150â Trott 11.
Eady now joined Graham. Myers did some
great service behind the wickets, and Butts'
work in the off field was superb.
At 160 Granam was clean bowled by Cookson
for 80. Seven ior 161. Eady was joined by
Jones. The Californians were now putting up
a very steady game. At 164 Jones was beauti
fully stumped by Myers, having only made 3,
and'McKibbin went in. Slowly the score rose
to 170. Both bowlers were at their best, and
there was a long pause before 180 was up.
Then Dickinson relieved Cooksou. At 190
McKibben was run out, the ball being re
turned by Cookson. Nine for 192â McKibbin
12.
Johns, the last man, then joined Eady. He
tipped one for a single and in the next was
magnificently caught in the deep field by
Hood, Eady was not out for 19. Total for the
innings, 193.
The Callfornlans' innings was opened by
Sloman and Bowhill, who faced the celebrated
bowlers Jones and McKibbin. The former's
lightning balls aroused the excitement of the
crowd and perplexed Sloman, who received
the. first, a maiden over. Bowhill broke hi
8
duck off McKibbin's third ball and Sloman cut
one for two. Jones bowled Bowhlll in the next
over one for three. :,. - . . Â . v
Moriarty joined Sloman and was bowled the
second ball. His place was taken by Toddy
Hood and presently tipped Jones for 2 and
then for 3. Later he was run out. Three
wickets for 8. Hosrue joined Sloman and got a
f ingle on the third ball. A bye made the first
10. Eady, the other fast bowler, took Mc-
Kibbin's place. Hogue placed his first ball for
3, but the second took Bloman's leg stomp.
Four for 13. Simmon* joined Hogue. Both
batsmen shaped well and scored a few singles
a.id twos besides making a vigorous defense.
With the score at 18 Hogue fell to one of
Eady's, having contributed 7. Then came
Myers. After two or three overs he made 2
and put the score to 20. Simmonds soon after
ward was caught in the slips. Six for 20.

MORE FEES FOR JURORS
The City and County Attorney
Says All Jurors Are En
titled to Them.
The Opinion Relates to Grand Jurors
and Those Employed in Crim
inal Cases.
City and County Attorney Creswell ren
dered an affirmative opinion yesterday on
the question as to whether grand jurors
and jurors in criminal cases Â«are entitled
to fees under the fee bill of 1895, recently
declared by the Supreme Court to be ap
plicable to this City.
The opinion was rendered at the ro
quest of the Board of Supervisors, to
whom numerous applications for fees
have recently been made. It was as
follows:
Section 19 of the act of the Legislature of
this State entitled "an act to establish the
fees of county, township and other officers,
and of jurors and witnesses iv this State," ap
proved March 28, 1895, reads in part as fol
lows:
-'For attending as a grand juror or juror in
the Superior Court, for each day's attendance,
per day, $2."
If this provision of the act of 1895 applleÃ to
the City and County of San Francisco the City
and County would be liable to each grand
juror for $2 per day and to jurors in the Su
perior Court in criminal cases in a like sum
tor each day's service-
The question whether this law applied to
the City and County of San Francisco came
squarely before our Supreme Court in the case
ol Miller vs. Curry. In the opinion rendered
in that case on August 7 of the present year,
the court said:
"The sole question presented on this appeal,
and therefore the only questiou to be decided,
is the applicability ol the said act of 1895 to
the City and County of Sau Francisco."
The court held that the act was applicable,
and that its provisions should be observed by
the officers of said City and County.
sucn being tne case it follows that grand
jurprs and jurors in the Superior Court are en
titled to the payment of $2 for each day's at
tendance, and that the City and County is
liable therefor.
The cost to the City of this ruling will
be many thousands annually.

ILL THE TICKETS
IN THE FIELD
The Time for Filing Ex
pired at Mid
night.
Max Brooks, Citizens' Republi
can Nominee for Recorder,
Withdraws.
THE POSITION LEFT VACANT.
Forged Names Found on Several Pe.
titions Called to the Attention of
Registrar Hinton.
Yesterday being the last day under the
election law for filing the tickets of po
litical parties by petition. Registrar Hin
ton was busier than usual, and remained
in his office till midnight to receive pro
tests, withdrawals, amendments and such
other matters as might be brought before
him.
The following parties were placed on
the official ballot: Republican, Demo
cratic, People's, Citizens' Non-Partisan,
Socialist Labor, Citizens' Independent,
Citizens' Republican, Anti-Charter Demo
cratic, United Labor.
The candidates for the mayoralty are:
Charles L. Taylor (R., C. 1., U. L.), James
D. Phelan (D., C. N.-P.), Joseph L Di
mond (P., A. C. D.), Charles S. Lau
meister (C. R. P.) and Oliver Everett
(S. L.).
These five candidates will represent the
nine tickets now in the field. The ballot
is not expected to be any larger than a
|10 blanket this year, and the average
voter will have to hustle around pretty
lively to mark bis ballot in tbe ten min
utes allowed by Jaw.
The attention of the Registrar was called
to the similarity of handwriting on several
of the petitions, whereas the law requires
that all tbe signatures shall be the auto
graphs or the genuine signatures of the
persons whose names they purport to be.
To each petition is appended the affidavit
of one of the signers, certifying that he
knows of his own knowledge that the sig
natures are genuine.
The affiiavit is in printed form and is
acknowledged before a notary public.
- Registrar Hinton said that he would
probably bring the matter before the
Grand Jury for the purpose of making a
test case of perjury. He added that as
there were a sufficient number of appar
rently genuine names on the petitions, he
bad no recourse other than to place the
tickets on tbe official ballot.
Leon E. Jones, regular Republican can
didate for tne Assembly from the Thirty
ninth District, appeared before the Regis
trar and formally protested against tbe
acceptance of the petition of Dr. F. M.
Tuiey as the Citizens' Independent party
candidate for tbe same office. Mr. Jones'
protest was based upon the argument that
all the members on Dr. Tuley's purity
committee do not reside in that Assembly
district, and that tbe petition is improp
erly certified to.
At a late hour last night Max Brooks,
candidate for Recorder on the Citizens'
Republican ticket, notified the Registrar
that he bad withdrawn. Under section
1192 tbe vacancy cannot be tilled.
When the hour came at midnight that
marked the limit for the tiling of nomina
tions with the Registrar, eleven tickets
naming candidates for electors, .Congress
men and legislators, and nine tickets com
prising candidates for municipal honors
were on the record of his office.
On the general ticket thirty -four offices
are to be filled, and on the municipal
fifty-four, counting those county offices
whose statuj is still in doubt. The gen
eral ticket will present in the neighbor
hood of 175 candidate to the voter, and the
municipal ticket about 275.
Extra lines to the number of all tbe
offices to be voted for will be left on each
ticket, so that the general ticket will have
about 210 numbers and the municipal
ticket 330. The municipal printed baflot
will be but slightly smaller than that of
two years ago, when it comprised 385 num
bers and measured 32x18 inches. The gen
eral ticket will be about two-thirds mis
size.
Only three complete general tickets were
hied. These were by the Republican,
Democratic and People's parties. While
the Citizens' Non-Partisan party named a
full legislative ticket, it had no Crongress
men and of course no electors to present
for tbe suffrage of the voter. The Social
ist Labor party is ragged right through,
there being big gaps in many of the offices
and no State Senator was nominated by
them.
The Prohibition party ticket consists of
electors and Congressmen only and the
National and National Democratic tickets
will bear the names of electors only. The
general ticket of the Citizens' Republican,
Anti-Charter Democratic and Citizens' In
dependent tickets show only legislative
nominees.
There will be four complete municipal
tickets, comprising those of tne Repub
lican, Democratic, Anti-Charter Demo
cratic and United Labor parties. The
Peoples' party made no nomination for
Treasurer nor for two School Directors for
the unexpired terms of these offices; tne
Citizens' Non-Partisan party omitted to
nominate for the unexpired term of Treas
urer; the Citizens' Independent party
failed to name candidates for Recorder,
Districl Attorney, one Superior Judge,
two Justices of the Peace and lor Super
visor of the Third Ward. The Citizens'
Republican ticket was broken at a late
hour last night by the withdrawal of Max
Brooks hs Recorder.
The only independent candidate's name
that will be .printed on the official ballot
is that of Horace W. Philbrook, who is
out for Superior Judge.
NORTHWEST FOR McKINLEY
Lumberman Norton Reports Great Gains
iv Washington and Oregon.
P. D. Norton, assistant treasurer and
general manager of the St. Paul and Ta
coma Lumber Company of Tacoma,
Wash., one of the largest lumber manu
facturing concerns in the boundless for
ests of Puget Sound, who is stopping at
the Palace, brings some political news
from the Northwest. It is good news for
Republicans and Major McKinley, since
up to the present time the States of
Washington and Oregon have been breed
ing beds of Populism.
Mr. Norton is a member of the City
Council of Tacoma, representing the Sec
ond Ward, the most aristocratic ward in
the city. He said :
"Early in the campaign we did not ax
pect much success in Washington for the
St. Louis platform and Major McKinley.
Bat during the la&t four weeks the situa
tion has greatly changed, and we shall be
surprised* up there if the sound money
ticket does not prevail. The siverites are
strongest east of the Cascade Mountains,
bnt they are losing converts daily. I am
firmly of the opinion that we shall carry
the State for McKinley. Leading bankers
and business men of Portland nave told
me that Oregon is going for McKinley
also. How is California? In my judg
ment Major McKinley is already elected
President." _
ADULTERATED MILK.
Antone Good Arrested While Filling
Up His Cans With Water From
a Horse Trough.
Milk inspector Dockery received infor
mation that a milkman was in the habit
of stopping in front of a watering trough
at Fifth and Shipley streets in the early
hours of the morning and mixing the
water with the milk in his cans.
Dockery and Meat inspector Davis
drove from the City Hall about 2 o'clock
yesterday morning and lay in wait for the
arrival of the milkman. About 4 o'clock
he drove up, took a milk can from his
wagon, filled it from the watering trough
and was pouring it into his milk cans
when tbe two Inspectors walked up to
him and placed him under arrest.
He was recognized as Antone Good, who
was arrested about a year ago for adulter
ating his milk. He and his wagon were
driven to the City Prison, where Dookery
tested the milk and found that it had all
been adulterated before the wagon
reached the watering trough. Good was
simply adding a little more water to make
it last longer. He gave as an excuse that
his employer, A. Simeon, was a poor man
with a big family.
Good was booked for violating the milk
ordinance and Dockery dumped all his
milk into the street. Yesterday morning
he appeared before Judee Low and the
case was continued until to-day.
RULER OF FOOD ISLANDS.
A Bough Treaty Which He Hopes This
Country Will Adopt.
Baron N. A. Grebnitzky, Governor of
Bering and Cooper islands, belonging to
Russia, is in the City, on his way to Wash-
ington. He carries with him tbe rough
draft of a treaty which he hopes the
United States will adopt, protecting all
our sealing grounds in the Northwest, as
well as these two, which constitute what
is known as the Commander group.
These islands are ninety miles from tbe
coast of Asia and 3CO from Kamschatka.
Taking seals and blue- foxes is the only in
dustry on any of the islands thereabout,
and the Governor says they ought to be
protected; otherwise the animals will be
destroyed.
The Governor is 60 years old, well pre
served and well informed in regard to tbe
islands. He has lived there several years.
George Kid or Club.
About 400 Republicans, representing each
of the Assembly districts, met Monday night a
the Shiels building, 22 O'Farrell street, todis
cuss plans to insure the election of George W.
Elder, the regular Republican nominee for
Superintendent of Streets.
Charles W. Manwaringr was elected president
and William E. Bates secretary.
Isaac P. Kincaid spoke in eulogizing terms of
George W. Elder and was followed by Harry
Grey, James Gilleran, Dawson Meyer, T. H.
McCarthy, E. C. Falmieri, Georgo Walker,
Andrew Branch and others.
A committee of five from each Assembly dis
trict was appointed by the chair and also a
committee to secure permanent headquarters.
By a unanimous vote the club was named
the George W. Elder Club and will have regu
lar meetings until the close of tne campaign.

The arrow flies with the wind. The top fipuree
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it. If any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and bundredths.
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hiÂ«h" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washineton
roast. When the pressure is high in the interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coas'. warmer
weather may be expected in Rummer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

Mff xORK MARKETS.
Financial.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 14.â During the early
trading at the*Btock Exchange to-day the market
ruled active and strong. A very confident tons
characterized the business, and there was good
buying for both local and foreign account. Quite
a number of operators espoused the bull cause,
bringing about higher prices for American securi
ties in London, large gold engagements, and the
favorable statement issued by the Bureau of Sta
tistics of the export trade of the coun.ry for Sep
tember. London houses were credited with taking
iully 2000 shares, principally SU Paul, Louisville
and Nashville and low-priced issues. The cold
engagements reported to-day foot up $1,500,000,
and according'to authorities the amount to be
shipped this way by steamers leaving Europe to
morrow. Saturday aDd Tuesday next will aggregate
$10,000,000.
The heaviness of sterling exchange (posted rates
had been reduced y^ c to $4 8iy 2 @4 84%) is in
terprt-tea as meaning that the movement ibis way
will continue for some time. This Is borne oat by
the excellent showing made by the trade statistics
for September. In that month the increase in the
exports of breadstufi's, provisions, mineral oils
and <otion is $20,641,132 as compared \sith 1895.
Imports for the same mouth this year have been
light, and this is also in our favor. The advance
in .stock prices during the morning session ranged
from Ua to 'iy % per cent, the anthracite, industrials
and grangers being the leaders.
Lackawana rose 3 to 156; Delaware and Hud
son, 3Vi to 173 Vi: Cotton Oil, preferred, 2Vs to
50ya: Sugar, 6fc .0 109. St. Paul, l%io 71; Hock
Island, IV4 to t>iy 8 , and Chicago Gas, is /g to 6iy a .
Tobacco was weak throughout, and on attempts to
realize the price broke from 76 to 71%. Late in
the day money on call suddenly rose to 10 per cent
bid, and this started a moderate selling movement.
A react onary tena-ncy in the cereal market also
had an adverse Influence. Reports of advance in
Bank of England rate to 4 per cent to-morrow and
a belief that the St. Paul s earnings for the second
week of October will be unfavorable also induced
realizations. The decline from the top of the day
was equal to V2<olT'b per cent, tne latter in Man
hattan. 4
A feature of the day was the heavy offerings 01
money by Morgan Bros, after call loans had
been Did up to 10 i<er cent, in the specialties Illi
nois steel jumped 3% to 46; dropped to 40yg and
closed at 41*4. Speculation left off steady in
tone. Net changes show gains of per
cent. Tobacco lost 3Vs and Manhattan and
Northwest 6/g per cent each. Total sales were
203,945 shares, including 39.200 Sugar, 32,100
si. Paul and 17,400 Tobacco. Bonds were strong.
Sales were heavier tlian of late, footing up $1,400,

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, I_ZÂ», Oct. 14.â 8u1l enthusiasm In
wheat was in full force at the opening of the mar
ket this morning, in explanation of which was
urged the reports of cargo sales at San Francisco.
Liverpool offered no further encouragement, that
market responding to our advance of yesterday by
Vid. The effect of this Information was apparent
saortly after trading began, when prices declined
IVic A slow recovery then took place. North
western receipts were not so heavy this morning,
867 cars arriTing, against 1162 last Wednesday
and 914 a year ago.
The reduction was ascribed to difficulty In ob
taining cars. Chicago received 356 cars and in
spected out 17,000 bushels. The market exibited
more or less weakness throughout the session,
holders availing themselves of every little recov
ery to dispose of wheat. Closing Paris and Berlin
cables were higher and Antwerp unchanged. Ex
port clearances were liberal at 368.940 bushels.
In the last fifteen minutes prices advanced over
lc from the inside, but again quietly declined and
closed within a fraction of the lowest point of the
day. The flurry was occasioned by reports of a
fiesb demand from India December wheat
opened from 70%@70y8f, sold between 71c and
6 y4@Â«9s/ B e, closing a 693, B @69y a c, % c under
yesterday. Estimated receipts for to-morrow, 360
cars.
CORNâ Showed ready agreement with the mo
tion of wheat. At the opening buying was en
couraged by higher Liverpool cables aud b.- large
Inspections from storeâ Hi 8,630 bushelsâ but the
quick retrogression in wheat exerted a depressing
Influence and prices declined. Receipts were 768
cars, three more than expected. Export dear
ances amounted to 38.518 bushels. May corn
opened from â . 8. r >s@2rt3iC declined to 27 3 ,4 C, clos
ing at 28VgCâ s^-go unutr yesterday. Estimated
receipts for to-morrow 950 cars.
OATSâ Took strength and vigor at the openlnz
from the adjoining pits, nut lost it when weakness
assumed control of the general situation. Re
ceipts were 407 cars, and 4943 bushels were with
druwn from store. Exports amounted to 160,893
bushels. May oats closed y g c lower. Estimated
receipt* for to-morrow 510 cars.
FLAXâ Was steady to tlrm. Cash, 75@76c; De
cember. 76@77c; May, 8iy 4 @82. Receipts were
109 cars.
PROVISIONSâ The support was withdrawn
from products right at the opening this morning
and prices fell away sharply. A decline of 6c in
hog prices was ostensibly the immediate factor,
but the recent advance* were apparently vlewe I
as of doubtful merit, and holders were willing sell
ers to obtain profits. At the ciose January pork
was 45c lower and January lard and ribs each
27y2Clower

HIDES, TALLOW, WOOL AND HOPS.
HIDES AND SKINSâ The circular of W. B.
Suainer A Co. says: "The market shows some im
provement since our last report, and Hides,
Leather, Wool, Sheepskins and Tallow are firmer
in the Eastern cities and at somewhat better
prices. There seems to be more confidence In the
business outlook. Stocks generally are small, aud
in the course of thirty days we hope to see a better
valuation In all goods in our line. Wet salted
hi .es continue about the same, although we mark
up prices. There aro only small stocks on hand
and values are well sustained. Wet sa.inl kip,
veal and calf are more active at better prices. Dry
flint bides are higher, owing to a quick market in
the East. As but few or no dry hides were tanned
in Caliiornia the prices on these goods are made
on the values obiainaDlu by shipments of this
stock to New York and Boston. These shipments
are always mane on a very close margin. Dry
flint kips are quiet with no improvement. Asa
rule dry kips are sold about 1 MÂ»c f: lb less than the
rates of dry hides. Horse hides are at a standstill,
and little or nothing can be done with these goods
at present. Wool and sheep skins are quiet but
firmer and the tendency is toward better prices.
We can quote Sheepskins as active. Tallow is
firmer and prices in Chi ago and New York have
advanced about V*c %* lb. We mark Ta.Mow at
higher rates. Deerskins continue nominal, the
trade being confined 10 skins which come from
Alaska and foreign countries. The summer and
short-hairec! skins are desirable and bring fay
prices, but the thin, pasery and winter skliis are
dull at the lowest ngurex. The general prospects
of the Hide and Leather trade are to-day more en
couraging than they have been at any time during
the past three or four months, and we hope to see
within thirty days a more active business and bet
ter values. " Heavy salted steers are quotable at

COALâ a local circular says: "Thetotal amount

tons capacity; a large portion of tuis cannot urrive
in 1896. Low prices still prevail, the lowest on
record, leaving a very- small pittance to the Coal
iiewers, a very nominal amount for freight and
c rtainly no profit to the Importers: hence the
black diamond has been a most undesirable arti
cle to handle in 1896 for all except consumers.
Our coast miners are Immediate sufferers lrom
this local depression, and the* prudently are not
forcing their output on the market. They an- fully
aware that these low quotations cannoi continue,

WITH INSANITY
Had Prepared to Wed a
Descendant of Empress
Josephine.
The Hotel Girard Was Beauti
fully Decorated, but the Groom
Did Not Appear.
WARRANT FOR HER ARREST.
Mrs. Coonradt, Aged 60, Declares Her
Love for a Man Ten Years
Older.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 14. )
There was to have been a weddiDg last
night at the Hotel Girard, but the eroom
did not appear. This evening the bride
elect was arrested on a charge of insanity,
sworn to by her son-in-law.
Mrs. Virginia Coonradt is a widow, 00
years of age. who resides at Linda, Vista
terrace. Last evening she arranned to be
married to Eugene de Beauharnais, who
is 70 years of age, and claims to be a direct
descendant of tne Empress Josepnine.
The lady is well known and well con
nected in this city. She owns much prop
erty, including a beautiful home at Linda
Vista.
Joseph dv France, who is a brother of
Mrs. Coonradt, said that his sister met De
Beauharnais several mont s ago and
some time later she tuld her relatives that
an engagement existed between them.
"We looked into the matter," said Mr.
dv France, "and once my son followed
them to the car and saw De Beauharnais
take my sister in his arms and kiss her
good-by. This gave things a serious
aspect, but stiil we did noi take much
stock in the prospective marriage story.
We had a little trouble at home and my
sister went to the Girard Hotel to board.
It seems that a few day i ago she went to
Stockton and from there telegraphed for
De Beaubarnais. He went at her call
and 1 understand they made the final
marriage arrangements. She was to trade
this nome tor a hotel taere and they were
to go into business.
"Things came to a climax yesterday
morning, when she came oofu f here and cut
all the greens and flowers to decorate the
hotel parlors for the wedding, which she
said was to take place at 9 o'clock last
nigot.
"She invited all the neighbors to be
present and extended invitations to others
by telephone. She asked Mr.Â«. Hynan for
the loan of her best dress. Herdau^n
ter- went down to stop the affair, but as
the groom did nr>t put in an *\ pearance
there was little difficulty about ihat."
Great preparations were made at the ho
tel. Material for the feast was ordered
and t.elivered and all the hails and the
banquet-room were decorated, but all to
no purpose.
De .beauharnais resides at the Hotel
Alexander in fcan Francisco. His friend,
EmiJ Schmeci, said last night that General
.Beauharnais had no intention 01 marry
ing any one â neither Mrs. Coonradt nor
any one else. He believed the lady to be
irresponsible.

The Desert d Wile D Clares That He

Oaklant) Office Pan Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 14. \
It is now two weeks since Samuel
Spackman disappeared in the night from
his home at 724 Feralta street, leaving his
wife and two-year-old child.
Not the slightest trace has been discov
ered as to wheth -r he is living or dead.
Previous to his sudden departure the
managers of the Oakland Trotiine Pirk
h d just about perfected arrangements for
Spackman to enter the Fahiola Hospital
to be treated for an injury to nis skull
from a falling beam while employed at
the racetrack.
He objected to undergoing a surgical
operation that was necessary for his re
covpry on account of a prejudice against
hospitals, and worried over the situation
considerably, and his wife and riends
now think he left borne while temporarily
deranged.
So confident is his wife that he will re
cover his ieason and return that she re
mains in the cottage a.'one with her child,
fearing to move lest Mr. Spickman should,
come back and not be able to find her.
Several of the m-iglibors claim to have
Sf'en him after nightfall walking up ;ind
down past the SpacKman residence acting
strangely two or three times during the
past week peering into the windows of
the house.
A Test Case.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 14.â License In

THE LOUVRE OPENING.
Palatial Appointments of thÂ« New Ees
taurant in the Maodotiough Block.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 14.â For the first
time this city is to have a firat-class
Louvre. Several attempts have been
made to establish a truly good restau
rant, bat through the incapacity of the
management and the failure >o obtain a
firm hold on the public taste they have
lived but a short time, and the Sheriff' 3
lock has told the final chapter of their
story.
The handsome basement under tbe
Macdonough Theater has been beauti
fully fitteri up by W. P. Jensen, aud he
will open it Thursday evening with a first
class concert. Mr. Jensen has been a
restaurateur here for a long time and has
already established his reputation for
beina able to satisfy the taste of local
patron fc.
The banquet-hall is a special feature,
and as there is not a similar place any
where in this City he expects to find that
his elegant hall will fill a want that has
long been felt. Louis Fourniguver will
reign supreme in the large kitchen, and as
he has made a lasting reputation for him
self at the Good Fallows' Grctto| across the
bay he will not be strange to a large pro
portion of bis future patrons.
Mr. Jensen's idea w to conduct a first
class commercial and family lunch and
dining establishment. A special feature
will be made of the bar, whica will, how
ever, be quite distinct from the restau
rant.
There is a beautifully frescoed billiard
room, and in every apartment soft-tinted
frescoing* and elegant lamps are as pleas
ing to the eye as the excellent menu is to
tne palate.

In:.' at the rncetrack, lit to conduct its busl-
Supervisor Talcott pro-jness with the under
testing; therefore, we.'standing that no pools
aÂ« represent'i fives ot be sold other than on
Christian churches, do the races run on the
most earnestly protest: local track, and that
against the nction of no races be run on
the Supervisors, and! Sunday,
request that the per
mission be reconsid
ered.
Director Fish of the Merchants' Ex
change, who is the author of the resolu
tion indorsing the Sjpervisors, has made
much Inquiry into the matter.
"1 have lately been called upon, 1 ' said
Mr. Fish, "by a representative of Thomas
William*, president of the Oakland Rac
ing Association. He toid me what had
been done at the track and what the asso
ciation intended to do. I am a passably
fair Christian, and I know for a fact that
some of the ctiurch people of this city are
trying to pledge the Supervisors and
candidates to vote, if elected, against al
lowing the association to carry out their
enterprise. This racetrack will bring
thousands of dollars into this city. Mr.
Williams came here to live and right now
he is spending $500 a month for his per
sonal expenses. This enterprise has al
ready spent $225,000 in Oakland for mate
rial and labor. They propose to stay here
permanently. All over the sporting world
Oakland will be advertised by this enter
prise.
''Business men will not be able to read
a newspaper anywhere in the civilized
world witnout hearing of Oakland. lam
told that from fifty to 100 families will lo
cate in Oakland â families worth all the
way from $100,000 to $500,000. Here ate
people who have money and speni it, and
will spend it here instead of goin? to
Southern California. This Oakland Rac
ing Association intends to patronize tnis
city in every way possible. They will
spend $50,000 a month for running ex
penses. We must do something to off.-et
the narrow-mindeo policy of the people
who are trying to injure us."
Director Bohst was very emphatic.
"That element which tries to induce the
Supervisors to drive the races away from
Oakland is the element which has been a
curse to this town for the last twenty-five
years," said Mr. Sohst. "Mr. Williams
has said that if he nad known that: he
would meet with this opposition he would
have located elsewhere. These are the
same people who opposed the erec ion of
the Macdonough Theater. They didn't
want a theater here at all. They preach
against theaters and they run all" over the
world attending themâ all over the world,
Paris not excepted. They all go there.
And we would all go there if we could, but
we have to send our minis:ers instead.
This is a serious question. Like Mr. Fish,
lam somewhat of a Christian. 1 send my
children to Sunday-schuol and I b-lieve
in churches, but I also believe in a little
business, and when tnese gentlemen come
to us with a way of making times beiter,
when they don't ask us for a cent, but
bring money and hundreds of people
and a continual stream of business into
Oakland, I am in favor of encouraging
them.
"The poor farmer gets tfce most of the
benefit of this thing. There are from 1500
to 3000 horses to be stabled at the track
and these horses need bedding, they need
hay and straw. They will be supplied
from Alameda and Contra Costa counties.
Bicycles don't eat hay, nor do tbe girls
that ride them, but horses do, and the
good road into Contra Cosia County that
we have been lighting lor hereto.ore bene
fited only the cyciists, because the farmer
couldn't sell hia bay when he got it here.
Now Mr. Williams and company have
made a hay marke'."
The ministers have announced that they
will express their views from tne pulpits
next bunday and the Merchants' Ex
change will probably call a public meet
ing, at which the matter will be exhaust
ively discussed.

Want Their Name.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 14.âThe people
of Golden Gate object seriously to having
their identity lost in an incorporation
scheme. While they are unanimous al
most regarding the benefits of such an act,
they beli. ye that the new town should be

meeting is to be ca.led soon to discuss the
matter.
A Damage Salt.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 14.âJudge Ells
worth and a jury are trying the suit of

LEFT FOR OTHER CLIMES
Evangelist Adams Has Sud
denly Departed From
Berkeley.
Youn? Parkhurst's Death Probably
Caused From N.glectâ New*
Noes.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 14.âConsider
able of a sensation was created in Berke
ley to-day because of the sudden and un
expected departure to other fields of Rev.
A. A. Adams, the traveling gospel-teacher,
who has been striving for the past week to
.pet together a band of forty followers from
Berkeley to go with him on an evangel
istic tour.
He preached a stirring sermon last Sun
day at the Baptist church and concluded
his discourse by calling for forty young
men and women to go with him.
Two girls and two young men said they
were willing to follow him. Arrange
ments were being made for the tour when
the parents of the young people stepped
in and put a stop to the scheme.
Where the evangelist has gone and what
he intends to do next is a matter of specu
lation.
Cause of Parkhnrat's Death.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 14.â Reports
from Ukiah, where the inquest over the
remains of youni: Webster Parkhurst, who
died so suddenly last week, was held, go
to show that he came to his death through
sheer neglect. The testimony at the
Coroner's inquest indicated that if proper
care had been given the young man he
would have recovered Jrom what at fint
appeared to be only a slieht indisposition.
It seems that the young man oelieved in
"faith cure," as also did his associates on
the evangelistic tour. He would not take
any medicine until it was too late to be of
use.
Firit Congregational.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 14â The First

prosperous condition, under the very able
pastorate of Mr. Hatch.

TO TALK AGAINST
THE CHARTER
Joseph I. Dimond, Buckley
Candidate fcr Mayor,
at the Temple.
On This Historic Battleground a
Rally Will Be Held
To-Night
JAMES H. BARRY'S POSITION.
Eiitor of the Star Supports Mr. Ph -lac,
but Fights the Charter â Some
Democrats Are Wavering.
Anti-charter sentiment still rages in the
breasts of local Democratic managers and
workers, and this feeling is not by any
means confined to the Buckley wing of the
party.
It ia true that Joseph I. Dimond, tbe
Buckley nominee for Mayor, was the first
to announce his opposition to this pro
posed municipal organic act, but recent
developments show that some of the most
sincere adherents of J. D Phelan, Junta
nominee for Mayor, are also against the
charter.
For instance, James H. Barry, editor of
the Star, while a strong advocate ior the
election of Mr. Phelan, holds to
the opinion that the charter has too
many defects, and that its adoption
would be a. serious mistake. In fact,
he thinks that it would amount to a
calamity should a majority of th. votes
be caat for the document. Yet, in spite of
this, be will continue to stand by the
cause of Mr. Phelan, pointing out that
neither the acceptance nor rejection of the
charter affects the personality or fitness
of the nominees for Mayor.
There are many Democrats, however,
who arp not able to so clearly distinguish
the d.ffrence in a case of this kind, and
they will hold Mr. Phelan accountable lor
his opin<ou in favor of the charter. As
sociating the candidate and his platform,
so to speak, for Mr. Phelan has made the
charter the principal issue in this cam
paign, they will cast their votes and in
fluence in favor of the opponent who
nearest represents their predilections in
affairs po it cal.
Joseph I. Dimond. the Buckley nominee
for Mayor, hopes to reap, much benefit
from this threatened defection, and j ro
poses to pu-h his advantage in this re
-pect to the fullest possible extent. In
order to more fully give expression to his
views on this point Mr. Dimond has called
for a meeting oi Anti-Charter Democrats
(formerly known as Buckleyites), said
meeting to be held at Metropolitan Hall
to-nijrht. In that historic temple, wherein
more than one Mayor of San Francisco
has been made or marred, surrounded by
flaring torches, streaming banners and
encouraged by ihe resounding notes of a
martial band, Mr. Dimond will expound
the reasons that lead him to denounce tÂ»n
instrument which in the case of his elec
tion and its adoption would make bim the
arbitor of the civic fate of nearly all the
office-seekers oi this municipality,
Mr. Dimond has let it be understood
that he will speak plainly and vigorously
on the issues of the present municipal
campaign, paying particular attention to
his anti-charter litrht, and liis oratory is
expected to. increase the local political
temperature several degrees.
The Junta Democrats are active in ar
ranging for public meetings. They have
engaged speakers to appear at Mowry's
Hail, corner of Grove and Lacuna streets,
to-nitiht. To-morrow night two meetings
will bo held under their direction, one at
Drew's Hall, 121 New Montgomery street,
and another at Franklin Hall, corner of
Bush and Fillmore streets.
Judge J. G. Maguire, Democratic
nominee for Congressman from tbe Fourth
Congressional District, is having a busy
time of it. He is billpd to speak every
night for tbe next week, and sometimes
twice the same night.
Charles Wesley Reed made another ap
lication in the Superior Court yesterday
for a writ of injunction to restrain Regis
trar Hinton from allowing the so-cailed
Buckley faction of the Democratic party
irom designating themselves on the ballot
as the Anti-Charter Democrats. Reed con
tends that the word Anti-Charter would
have a tendency to contuse the minds of
the voters. Judge Slack promised to grant
a hearing of the matter to-morrow.
Tb^re was a noisy scene at the office of
the Registrar of Voters yesterday when
Samuel Braunhart declared his desire to
protest against the tiling of the Buckley
legislative ticket under the designation of
the Anti-Charter Democratic party.
Registrar Hinton said that his attorney
had advised him that under existing cir
cumstances it is his duty to file the ticket
as presented, and that unless a legal show
ing is made against sucn n course he will
proceed in that manner. Mr. Hinton said
that in any event he will be guided by the
orders of the court and the advice of his
attorney. _______________
WEODEO AND ARRESTED,

Wedding Cere

A Serious Charge Against Edward
G. Maxwell, the
Groom.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 14. j
justice Lawrence married a young cap
italist to-night to a girl 16 years of age
and immediately after served him with a
warrant for a criminal charge preferred by
another young girl.
Edward G. Maxwell, according to the
story told to the Justice when he issued
the warrant for his arrest, met Miss Katie
Langbehn five years ago. At that time she
was a clerk in a store on San Pablo avenue.
Maxwell promised to marry her and later,
on the strength of this promise, she
stated, look her to live with him, and al
though he did not marry her he provided
for her and introduced her as his wife.
She says ;hat she is in reality his com
mon law wife, as this all took place before
the act regulating common law marriage
passed by the last Legislature. Maxwell
will have to answer a charge of bigamy if
Miss Langbehn'a contention is valid. She
declares that he is the father of her two
children, who were born while they were
living together, and she has repeat
edly aiked him to marry her but he has
refused to do so, and this afternoon he
procured a license to wed Miss Emma
Edwards.
Justice Lawrence said to-night that he

had heard that the charges could not be
substantiated and so be consented to
marry Maxwell to Miss Edwards. Max
well's friends declare that Miss Langbehn
is not possessed of the brightest of intel
lect and that she cannot substantiate her
charges.
Mi.xwell and his bride have lived at
Elm hurst for some time. He is a man of
means and she is a very attractive girl.
They are both well Known in that district
and ihe opinion is expressed that if Jus

truth in Miss Langbehn's 3tory to justify
him in issuing a warrant on a criminal

gave $500 bail and started on his honey

TO LAW FOR
FIRM PIRTIES
Important Letter Written
by Attorney - General
Fitzgerald.
Combination Candidates Are
Placed in a Peculiar
Position.
OKGANIZATIONS IN PANGEE.
The Supreme Court to Pass on the
Placing of Office-Seekers' Names
on the Ballots-
From all parts of tbe State letters of in
quiry have been sent to Attorney-General
Fitzgerald as to bow the names of candi
dates of fusion parties shall be placed upon
the ballots for the next election. The
varieties of the questions show that the
county officials are entirely at sea on this
all-important point, and that they are in
fear and trembling lest any action on
their part should give rise to irreparable
tangles and contentions immediately and
in the future.
Inquiries of the same sort have been
made by local politicians of the Attorney-
General, who will not assume the respon
sibility of straightening out the perplexi
ties under which so many minds are labor
ing relative to the Australian ballot Mr.
Fitzgerald has sent an answer upon these
points to J. \V. Ballard, the District At
torney of Orange County, in which he
says that the questions propounded should
be presented to the Supreme Court of this
State for a ruling. His letter to Mr. Bal
lard is herewith presented and the points
dealt with are of as much interest to local
politicians as to a dozen or more District
Attorneys who have made inquiries from
all over the State. The letter is as follows:
1 San Fkancisco. Oct. 14, 1896.
J. W. BaUard Esq., District Attorney t>f Orange
County, Santa Ana, Cal.â Dear Sib': 1 am iv
receipt of your lavor of the 30th ult., in which
you ask (1) "In case two different political
parlies nominnte the same mÂ»n to the same
office, how shall the ticket be printed? Should
the name of such candidate appear twice
with the name of each party following such i
same, or shall it appear but once with the I
name of bota parties following it?" and (2)
"If the name is printed twice, should all the
votes cast for the same man under each party
designation be counted for him as one man?"'
First â I have thoroughly examined the law
re.atlve to the manner in which the names of
persons nominated by more than one party
should be printed npon the ballot. The result
of my examination Is that 1 find the wuthori
tles In other States, where the Australian bal
lo: is in vegue, decidedly conflicting; and I
also find that the question has never been
passed upon by the Supreme Court of this
State.
In Nebraska, where the election laws bear a
close analogy to our own, it has been held in
the case ot State vs. Allen, reported in 62 N.
W. Rep., 35, that it was the evident intention
of the framers of the Australian ballot law< of
that State that the name of a candidate should
be printed once only on an official ballot, "ac
companied by such political or other designa
tion as corresponded with the nomination
papers on file with the officers charged with
the duty of priming and distributing such
ballots."
This case, however, is weakened as an
authority for the following reasons: (a) Tbe
Nebraska court evidently failed to consider
the fact that the segregation of the nominees
of each party from the nominees of alt other
parties was es.sential to the preservation of the
luture organization of such parties. That
court said: "The rights of no person or party
can be prejudiced by the construction
adopted." And again : "Nor can we conceive
of any objsct to be attained by the printing of
the name of the candidate twice or more on
the ballot, unless it be to thus secure the sup
port of the electors opposed to the so-called
lusion," etc.
It is evident from tnis that the court over
looked the provisions of section 1747 of the
Consolidated Statutes of the State of Nebraska
(taken from the Australian ballot law of that
State, which went in force on Mnrch 4, 1891)
defining a convention, or primary meeting of
parties nominating candidates withiu the
meaning of the Australia: 1 , ballot law, to be "an
organized assemblage of voters or electors rep
resenting Â« political party which at the last
election before the holding of such convention
or primary meeting polled at least 1 per
centum of the entire vote cast in the State,
county or other division or district in which
the nomination Is made."
If that provision had not been overlooked it
would have been plain to the court that two
parties nominatiug the same persons might
both be very seriously injured by the printing
of tbe names of such candidates once only
upon the ballot and the adding to those names
ot the joint party designations instead of
printing each of the names twice with the
designation of each party separately added;
for if, as might easily be the case, no candi
dates excepting so calied "fusion" candidates
were nominated by either of two political par
ties, and if, Â»fter the names of the candidates
so nominated, the joint designation of both
political parties should be printed, it would be
impossible, when the votes for those candi
dates were counted, to suy that either of the
political parties represented by such candi
dates cast any specific percentage of the votes
polled in the political subdivision for which
the candidates were nominated. Therefore,
neither of the parties could claim the right,
under ttie provisions of the Nebraska stfttute
quoted, to hold future conventions ior the
purpose of making nominations upon tbe
ground that such parties had polled at least
3 per cent of the entire vote cast at such elec
tion.
Section 1186 of our Political Code is prac
ticAlly identical with section 1747 of the Con
solidated Statutes of Nebraska, except that it
requires a political party to cast 3 instead of 1
per cent of the votes polled before sucti party
can nominate by convention. (6) The Ne
braska court in its decision alsosnid: "We
must not, however, be understood as holdiug
the provisions of the ballot law under con
sideration to be mandatory." In other words,
the court held this provision relative to the
manntr in which the name should be priuted
o*n the ballot to be directory only, and conse
quently the decision resolves itself merely into
the opinion of that court as to which of the
two methods is the better. This, of course,
renders the decision of little weight, as our
Supreme Court may entertain an entirely
different idea as to the relative merits of the
two methods.
In a number of otber States tbe courts have
held that the name of a nominee of the two
parties should appear twice on the ticket.
Kach of these decisions, however, is largely in
fluenced either by the peculiar wording of the
statutes under consideration, or by tne form
of the legal ballot which, in many of the
States, is different from that prescribed by
our election laws.
In view, therefore, of the manifest conflict of
authority, and of the fact that our Supreme
Court has not passed upon this question, and
in view, furthermore, of the importance of
the importance the question, I am of the
opinion thai it should be determined by the
courts in some proper proceeding brought for
that purpose.
Secondâ Until the manner in which the
names oi the "fusion" candidates snail be
printed upou the ticket is determined by the
couits, I cannot pass upon your second'ques
tion. Respectfully, W. F, Fitzgerald,
Attorney-General.

The i>Pinucr.itic and People's Candi
date for Mayor Begins His Campaign.
Supervisor Dimond, the Democratic
candidate for Mayor of San Francisco,
started out Tuesday night on his active
personal canvass of the City.
He began the campaign in an open-air
meeting at the corner of Second and How
ard streets. He wore no cane nor kid
gloves, but talked right out against the
charter and gave his attention to other
matters of interest to the people. This
evening he will speak in the Populist
tent and at the ratification meeting in
Scottish Hall, j Thursday.night.the nomi
nee for Mayor will <rreet the Democrats of
the Twenty-ninth District, probably at
Fourth and Howard streets.

Dimond wagon going through town with
its immense transparency bearing the
words: "Defeat the Charter" ' "A Vote
for Joseph I. Dimond la a Vote Against
the Charter."
Every day about 5000 circulars will be
issued from his headquarters against the
charter throughout the districts where
Dimond will speak.

H. Mangels and Joseph Maguire were ap
pointed a committee to present the fol
lowing resolutions to the Board of Educa
tion:
Whereas, An appropriation has been made
for the purchase of a high-school building sito
in tbe Mission district ; and whereas, the lot of

and Twentieth streets, being 200 feet frontage
on Folsom street, 245 feet frontage on Twen
tieth nnd 200 feet frontage on Treat avenue,
nas beeu submitted to your honorable board ;

lot is suitable in every respect for a high-school
building, and is very accessible and most cen
trally located of auy in the Mission: and
whereas, the irajor portion ol the population
is centered around this particular neighbor
hood; and whereas, tbe same is by far the
most reasonable in price of any other property
that has been offered to your honorable body;
therefore be it
Resolved, That the Folsom-street Improve
ment Club do urgently recommend tne selec
tion of said site by your honorable board for
said High School building.
Respectfully submitted,
George a. Raabk, President.

A MILLIONAIRE'S
QUEER COMPLAINT
He Charges That Mrs. N. A.
Abbott Has Bogus Mar
riage Contracts.
Why Thomas H. Quackenbush
Brings Spit While Yet in
the Flesh.
NOT MARRIED TO THE WIDOW.
Says His Only Heir Is His Daughter.
The Principals Well Con
nected.
A strange suit was filed by Attorney E.
J. Pringle at the City Hall yesterday. The
complaint was brought by Millionaire
Thomas H. Quackenbush as principal,
and it sets forth that Mrs. Nancy A. Ab
bott, a widow of this City, claims that
she has two contracts of marriage with
him, that he had never made sucn con
tracts, and that ne desires to fight them
in his lifetime instead of leaving his right
ful heir, Mrs. Esther E. Swartfiguer, his
daughter, to do so after his death.
Mr. Quackenbush is now 75 years old
and has been forty-four yearn a widower.
He is a California pioneer of 1849 and is
widely known. When he came here he
had already considerable means. He was
a good business man and therefore stead
ily and rapidly increased his wealth. A
large share of it was invested in real
estate. His home is with his daughter at
911 Webster street
Mrs. Abbott is a widow, whose huÃband
died several years ago, and is the mother
of Allen H. Abbott, assistant ticket agent
of the Southern Pacific Company at 613
Market street. Two of the sonsâ William
and George Abbottâ are well-known young
men here. Tney are all well connected.
Interest akin to a sensation has bee.i
caused by the suit. Occurring, as it has,
after the struggle began for the Fair mil
lions, and on apparently somewhat simi
lar lines, except that Mr. Quackenbush
has brought the suit, it has aroused much
comment.
The millionaire sets forth that the cir
culation of the story of the marriage con
tracted is evidently with the view of get
ting a portion ot his estate. He denies in
emphatic terms that Mrs. Abbott is en
titled to any ot it.
The suit is tiled therefore in order to
compel Mrs. Abbott to produce her alleged
contracts. He wants them declared false
in court, and while yet in the flesh will
fight them. He declares that he is not
now and never has been the lady's hus
band.
This is said to be almost an isolated case
oi a man bringing suit in his lifetime to
quash such contracts or alleged contracts.
The old gentleman feels that alive he will
stand a good show to get rid of them, but
after his death it might be difficult to
prove they were fraudulent.
Mr. Quackenbush years ago retired from
active business. He had invested from
time to timt in real - property which
steadily increased in value, and the con
sequence is that he has been able to take
life easily.
Mr. Quackenbusb, when seen at his
home last night, was very emphatic in his
confirmation of the statements made in
the complaint filed in the County Clerk's
office.
"I want everybody to understand that I
am not a married man," said he. "I have
been single for nearly 44 years. Mrs. Ab
bott has told a number of people that she
is my. wife, and that she holds a paper
which proves her statement. There is no
truth in it at all.
"I had a room at her house several
years ago, when she lived at Washington
and Powell streets, and while I was living
there I got sick and bad to take my meals
there, but I never told her I would marry
her and never wanted to marry her. Why,
I never even had such an idea. 1 paid her
for everything she did for me and for my
room and meals.
"My daughter and my son-in-law live
here with me, and my daughter is not
friendly with . Mrs. Abbott. They are
acquainted, that is all. They became
known to one another while I was sick,
when my daughter visited me at Mrs.
Abbott's house.
"It was during that sickness that Mrs.
Abbott obtained my signature to any
paper she may have, if she has any. It
was necessary for me to have some money
and 1 signed an order for icme. Tnen
Allie, Mrs. Abbott's son, came to me and
told me he had lost the order and I signed
another paper. I did not read either one ;
I was too sick. Those are the only papers
I remember to have signed that Mrs.
Aboott could have.
â¢'Lately I have been told by a Mrs. Tate
and several other friends that Mrs. Abbott
is only waiting for me to die to step in and
get my money. lam a man of consider
able property, and 1 intend to dispose of
it as I sea fit. No stranger shall get it. I
was told that Aliie has been making re
marks that when I die he will not have to
work any more, because he has a paper
that will make him rich. It won't,
though, for I have told Mr. Pringle to go
ahead and make that woman bring her
pretended contracts into court, and we
will see how much her son will get
"I do not intend to allow this matter to
drop and then have them slip in when I
am dead and cannot deiend myself and
stenl the property from my own flesh and
blood.
'â¢You can just say," added the old gen
tleman, "that if I am a married man I
want to tind it out."
Mrs. Abbott is said to live on Ellis street
near Hyde, but inquiry in that neighbor
hood last night failed to locate her.
Tricked the Bartender.
Edward Stevenson, a waiter, was booked at
the City Prison laat night on the charge of
petty larceny by Policemen T, L. Ryan and

Scene of the Place Where Mrs. Pauline Olivem Met a Horrible
Daath Yesterday Morning.
FATALITY IN CITY HALI,
Contractor George Pabst's Neck
Broken by a Falling
Plank.
A Rope S ipped and Precipitated the
Timbers Sixty Feet Upon
Him
George Pabst, a contractor, residing at
20 Prosper street Â«nd having a shop at 204
Mission street, was instantly killed in the
tower of the City Hall yesterday evening
shortly after 5 o'clock. He was standing
on the ground floor within the dome di
recting the lowering of some planks from
a staging over sixty feet above, when the
noose about the timbers slipped and they
were precipitated. One of them struck
the unfortunate man on the chin with
great violence and broke his neck.
JohnGasidns of 336 Eddy street, an em
ploye of the dead contractor, was lowering
the timbers. He saw the rope slipping
loose from where be had fastened it and
yelied for those below to look out. Two
workmen on an intervening staging heard
the warning and jumped out of the way.
Whether or not the dead man knew of the
danger is not known. The fact that he
was hit on the chin would indicate that he
was looking up at the time.
The deceased had the contract for plac
ing the metallic cornices used upon the
new dome. He had only come late in the
day to secure the two planks that he in
tended to take home with him.
Pabst was a large, powerful young man.
He leaves a widow and one child.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1896.
HER LIFE CRUSHED
OUT BY A WHEEL
Whirled Many Times
Around a Fast Revolv
ing Shaft.
Terrible Fate of a Woman Who
Worked in an Italian Paste
Factory.
HER BRAINS BATTERED OUT.
No Eye-Witnesses to Tell How the
Casualty Occurredâ Many Bones
Are Broken.
Mrs. Pauline Oliveiri met with a hor
rible death at the California Italian Paste
Works, 956 Bryant street, yesterday morn
ing. In some manner as yet unknown
her clothing caught on a narrow upright
shafting which was revolving at a high
rate of speed. The unfortunate woman
was whirled around with great velocity,
her head striking against a stanchion with
every revolution.
Mrs. Oliveiri was a Eacksewer at the
paste factory and worked on the second
floor of the building, though somewhat in
the rear. To reach this portion of the
building employes are compelled to pass
near the shafting, close by which opens a
door. It is believed, though there is no
proof of this, that when Mrs. Oliveiri at
tempted to pass this door the wino blew
her dress against the fast-revolving shaft
ing, with the sad result already told.
At the time of the accident there was no
one on the second floor. About 9:45
o'clock George Droosini, another em
ploye, had business in tho second story,
ami a shocking sight met his gaze when
he reached the landing. On the floor,
with her brains literally battered out, lay
Mrs. Oiiveiri. The shaft was still in mo
tion, but the woman's body had ceased to
keep it company.
â¢Her clothes were wound around the
shafting in such a manner as not to be
loosened by any amount of tugging and
pulling, so a knife had to be used. So well
hud the shaft done its work that the body
was almost nude when found. Coroner
Hawkins was notified and Deputy Coroner
Hallet went to the factory to remove the
remains. Then the full horrors of the
casualty were developed. The head was
crushed into a shapeless mass, the right
l'.-g and both arms broken, and the body
otherwise mutilated. Blood covered the
floor in all directions, the brains being
found in various parts of the room. The
features of the poor woman were entirely
unrecognizable.
The deceased was a native of Italy, 53
years old, and lived at 75 Converse street.
She bad worked for the Italian Paste Com
pany for seven years, and was always
faithful to her duties. Mrs. Oliveiri was
married, but her husband has been out of
woik for some time.

The People's party executive committee met
