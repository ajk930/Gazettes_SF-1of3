REAL REVIEW OF ISSUES TO BE
DECIDED TO-DAY.
Let All Who Have the Welfare of the Country
at Heart Read What the Standard-Bearer
of Prosperity Says Before Cast
ing Their Ballots.
THE FREE COINAGE OF SILVER.
For the first time since 1868, if ever before, there is presented to the American
people this year a clear and direct issue as to our monetary system, of vast importance
in its effects and upon the right settlement of which rests largely the financial honor
â¢and -prosperity of the country. It is proposed by one wing of the Democratic party
and its allies, the People's and Silver parties, to inaugurate toe free and unlimited
cqinage of silver by independent action on the part of the United States at a ratio of
sixteen ounces of silver 10 one of gold. The mere declaration of this purp^M ta a
menace to our financial ana industrial interests, and has already created universal
alarm. It involves great peril to the credit and business of the country â a peril so
. grave that conservative men everywhere are breaking away from their old party asso
ciations and uniting with other patriotic citizens in emphatic protest against the
platform of the Democratic National Convention as an assault upon the faith and
donor of the Government and the welfare of the people. We have had few questions
in the lifetime of the Republic more serious than the one which is thus presented.
DON'T BE MISLED.
The cnaracter of the money *hich shall measure our values and exchanges and
settle our balances with one another and with the nations of the world is of such
primary importance and so far reaching in its consequences as to call for the most
painstaking investigation, and, in the end, a sober, unprejudiced judgment at the
polls. We must not be misled by phrases nor deluded by lalse theories. Free silver
would not mean that silver dollars were to be freely had without cost or labor. It
would mean the free use ol the mints of the United States for the few who are owners
of silver bullion, but would make silver coin no freer to the many who are engaged in
ofher enterprises. It would not make labor easier, the hours of labor shorter or the
pay better.' It would not make farming less laborious or more profitable. It would
.not start a factory or make a demand for an additional day's labor. It would create
no new occupations; it would add nothing to the comfort of the masses, the capital of
. tne people or the wealth of the Nation. It seeks to introduce a new measure of value,
but would add no value to the tiling measured. It would not conserve values; on the
contrary, it would derange all existing values. It would not restore business conl.Â«
dence, but its direct effect would be to destroy the little which yet remains.
MEANS A PANIC.
. - If the free and uniimited coinage of silver at a ratio of sixteen ounces of silver to
one'ounce of gold would, as some of its advocates assert, make 53 cents in silver worth
100 cents, and the silver dollar equal to the gold dollar, then we would have no
cheaper money than now, and it would be no easier to get, but that snon would be
the result is against reason and is contradicted by experience in all lands. It means
the debasement of our currency to the amount of the difference between the commer
cial and coin value of the silver dollar, which is ever chancing, ana the effect would
be to reduce property values, entail untold financial loss, destroy confidence, impair
the obligations of existing contracts, further impoverish the laborers and producers
of the country, create a panic of unparalleled severity and inflict upon trade and com
mei.ee a deaaly blow. Against any :-ueh^policy lam unalterably opposed.
THE FRIFND OF SILVER.
The Republican party has not been and is not now opposed to the use of silver
money, as its record abundantly shows. It has done all that could be done for its in
creased use, with hafety end honor, by the United States acting apart from other Gov
ernments. There are tnose who think that it has already gone beyond the limit of
financial prudence. Surely we can go no farther, and we must not permit false lights
to lure as across the danger line.
INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM.
We'have more silver in use than any country in the world except India and Chirm
-$500,000,000 more than G-eat Brita:n, $150,000,000 more than France, $400,000,000
more than Germany. $325,000,000 less than India ana $125,000,000 less than China.
The Republican party has declared in favor of any international agreement, and if
elected President it will be my duty to employ all proper means to promote it. The
free coinage of silver in this country would defer, if not defeat, international bimetal
lism, and until an international agreement can be had every interest requires us to
maintain our present standard. Independent free c inane of silver at a ratio of six
teen ounces of silver to one ounce of gold would insure the speedy contraction of our
currency. It would drive at least five hundred millions of gold dollars, which we now
have permanently, from the trade of the country and greatly decrease our per capita
circulation. It is not proposed by the Republican party to take from the circulating
medium of the country any of the silver we now have. On the contrary, it is proposed
â¢to keep all of the silver money now in circulation on a purity with gold by maintain
ing the pledge of the Government that all of it shall bo equal to gold.
PROTECTION AND REVENUE.
The "public exigencies" demand prompt protective legislation which will avoid
the accumulation of further debt by providing adequate revenues for the expenses of
the Government. This is manifestly the requirement of duty. If eieced President
of the United States it wili be my aim to vigorously promote this obj* ct and give
, that ample encouragement of the occupations of the American people, which above
all else, is so imperatively demanded at this juncture of our National affairs.
GOLD AND PROSPERITY.
" It is a mere pretense to attribute the hard times to the fact that all our currency
is on a gold basis. Good money never made times hard. Those who assert that our
present industrial and financial depression is the result of the cold standard have not
read American history aright or been careful students of the events or recent years
â We never had greater prosperity in this country in every field of employment and in
dustry than in the busy years from 1880 to 1892, during all of which time this country
was on a gold basis and employed more gold money in itÂ« financial and business
operations than ever before. We had, too, a protective tar.ff, under which ample
revenues were collected for the Government and an accumulating surplus which was
constantly applied to the payment of the public debt. Let us hold last to that which
ire know is good. It is not more money we want; what we want is to put the money
me already bave at work. When money is employed men are employed. Botn have
Â»l*avs been steadily and remuneratively engaged during thu years of protective
V ft legislation.
PROTECTION AND WAGES.
Protection has lost none of its virtue and importance. The first duty of the Re
publican party, if restored to power in the country, wi.l be the enactment of a tariff
law which will raise all the money necessary to conduct the Government, economi
cally and honestly administered, and so adjusted as to u'ive preference to home manu
factures and adequate protection to home labor and the home market.
Wa are not committed to any special schedules or rates of duty. They are and
The San Francisco Call.
This generation has had its object lesson, and the doom of the Democratic party is already pronounced. The American people will return the Republican party to power, because they know that Its
administration will mean : Tne supremacy of the constitution of the United States ; the maintenance of law and order ; the protection of every American citizen in his right to live, to labor and to vote ; a
vigorous foreign policy; the enforcement of the Monroe doctrine; the restoration of our merchant marine ; safety under the stars and stripes on every sea, in every port; a revenue adequate for all governmental
expenditures and the gradual extinguishment of the National debt; a currency " as sound as the Government and as untarnished as its honor," whose dollars, whether of golJ, silver or paper, shall have equal
purchasing and debt-paying power with the best dollars of the civilized world; a protective tariff which protects, coupled with a reciprocity which reciprocates, thereby securing the best markets for American
products and op ning American factories to the free coinage of American muscle ; pension policy just and generous to our living heroes and to the widows and orphans of their dead comrades ; the governmental
supervision and control of transportation lines and rates ; the protection of the people from all unlawful combinations and unjust exactions of aggregated capital and corporate power ; an American welcome to
every God-fearing, liberty-loving, constitutional-respecting, law-abiding, labor-seeking, decent man ; the exclusion of all whose birth, whose blood, whose teachings, whose practices would menace the perma
nency of free institutions, endanger the safety of American society or lessen the opportunities of American labor; the abolition of sectionalismâ every star in.the- American flag shining for the honor and welfare
and happiness of every coir, mon wealth and of all tbe people ; a deathless loyalty to all that is truly American and a patriotism eternal as the stars.â Senator Thurston.
should be always subject to change, to meet new conditions, but the principles upon
which rates of duty are imposed are almost the same. Our duties should always be
high enough to measure the difference between the wages paid labor at home and in
competing countries, and to adequately protect American investments and American
enterprises.
WILL MAINTAIN LAW.
We avoid no issue. We meet the sudden, dangerous and revolutionary assaults
upon law and order and upon thoMe to whom is confided by the constitution and laws
the authority to uphold and maintain them which our opponents have made with the
same courage that we faced every emergency since our organization as a party more
than forty years ago. Government by law must be assurea ; everything else can wait.
The spirit of lawlessness must be < xiinguished by the fires of an unselfish and lofty
patriotism. Every attack upon the public faith and even suggestion of the repudia
tion of debts, public or private, must be rebuked by all men who believe that honesty
in the beat policy, or who love their country and wouid preserve unsullied its National
honor.
RECIPROCITY WITH OTHER NATIONS.
Another declaration of the Republican platform that has my most cordial support
is that which favors reciprocity. The splendid results of the reciprocity arrangements
that were made under the authority of the tariff law of 1890 are striking and sug
ues ive. The brief period they were in foree â in most cases only three years â was not
long enougn to thoroughly test their great value, but sufficient was shown by the trial
to conclusively demonsirate the importance and the wiÂ«dom ol their aaootion.
WRONG TO FARMERS.
Never was a more grievous wrong done to the farmers of our country than that so
unjustly inflicted during the past three years upon the woo'-growers of America.
Although among our most industrious and useful citizens, iheir intents have been
practically destroyed and our woolen manufacturers involved in similar disaster. At
no time within the past thirty-Mi years, and perhaps never during any previous pe
riod, have so many of our woolen lactories been (suspended as now. The Republican
party can be relied upon to correct these great wrongs, if again intrusted with the
control of Congress. [Extracts from Maj.r McKinley's letter of acceptance.]

CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 2.â Two delega

Tne first was composed of 350 ladies from
Akron, Ohio; the other came from Mas

expected. The candidate, feeling that the
work of the campaign bad been practically

thanked the visitors for the call. He said:
"I am very greatly obliged to the women
of Akron for this neighborly and gracious

LINCOLN, Nebr., Nov. 2.â William J.
Bryan began the closing day of bis memo
rable campaign tour early this morning.
He has said frequently in his speeches
that he would be found preaching the
doctrines contained in the Chicago plat
form up to the very eve of election, and
to-day saw tne fulfillment oi that prom
ise.
A special train, to which was attached
the private car Idler, the one in which
Mr. Bryan has traveled for a month, left
the Burlington station here at 6:45 this
morning for tbe final journey of tbe Dem
ocratic candidate before election day. Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan, with a number of the
National nominee's Nebraska suprorters,
occupied the Idler, while others of lesser
note were on board another coach. Chair
man James T. Dahlman and James Oshea
.of the State Central Committee were in
charge of the trip.
; AURORA, Nebr., Nov. 2.â Several hun
dred people were waiting in the crisp
morning air at Burlington station at Lin
coln to-day to see the candidate off. They
cheered when Mr. and Mrs. Bryan, with
their little daughter Grace, who is to make
the trip with them, appeared and they
sent up a btg shout a.-s the train moved off.
At tbe first stopping place Bryan was re
minded that the opponents of tbe Chicago
ticket in his own State were active. This
was at Seward, which was reached at 7:35
o'clock. Gold badges were displayed there
in large numbers, but Bryan was not in
terrupted in his fifteen-minute speech.
Tbe Republicans also organized a coun
ter display at York. Yellow ribbons were
noticeable among the crowd of 2000, but
did not number more than a sixth of rhe
entire audience. The cheering was very
hearty when Bryan ascended the plat
form erected for speaking purposes.
It was intermingled with some shoots
for McKinley. Bryan said some of the
people in. Nebraska seemed to be much
afraid that it would become popular to I
have a President from the West. He
could not understand, be said, how a
farmer could be in favor of the gold stand
ard, and be wen: on to tell his reasons
for making the statement, substantially as
he did in previous speeches.
HASTINGS, Nibb., Nov. 2.â A keen
east wind blew fiercely through the rants
of those wi.o gathered to hear Mr. Bryan
at Hastings. It was there that the Demo- j
cratic candidate crossed the tiath of John I
P. Irish, his old opponent in joint debate, ;
who is camping on the trail of the Demo
cratic candidate through Nebraska.
Colonel Irish reached Hastines on his
special train just before Mr. B"ryan left
this place, and the Republican meeting
began when the silver meeting was over.
People had gathered from far and near to
hear the nominee. Ten thousand of them,
mainly farmers, made up tbe assemblage
that greeted with wild cheers his appear
ance on a temporary stand. The audience
was plainly in sympathy with his views
and showed its intensity of partisan feel
ing in shrill sbouts. Gold badges were
few and far between. Wuite ribbons bear
â  ing the word "Bryan" in two-inch letters
were pinned on the bats and breasts of
men, women and children. It was truly
an enthusiastic throng and it heard one of
the- principal speeches of the day. Mr.
Bryan spoke as follows:
Mr. Chairman, ladles and gentlemen: I have
been absent from the State some two months,
and I have been reading In Republican papers
that there were certain Republicans in Ne
braska who inoucht this State was too far west
to 'furnish a President. [Laughter] I have
heard it stated that some Republicans out
here thought a man did not know anything
about the money question unless he lived in
New York where he was furrouuded by a Lon
don fog all the tine. [Cheers] I beard that
there were some Republican farmers out here |
who thought prices were not low enough, and |
they were going to try to continue the go!d
Etandard so that oats would go down to 5 cents I
a bushel. [Cheers] Well, I am glad to find
that these Republicans did not tell the truth
in their dispatches. [LRUghter and applause.]
I am very much gratified to find so many peo
ple testifying to their faith in bimetallism by
coming out to-day and doing what they have
been aoing all over this countryâ using their
voices until their voices are hoarse. [Ap
piause.]
Since I left Nebraska I have been as far East
MB the Kennebec River, and I want to tell you
that, no' matter what the papers may say,
there is a silver sentiment in Massachusetts
and Maine that is as intense as it is in Ne
braska. [Cheers.] When I have found a man
who has lived upon money and whose money I
was increasing in value under a gold standard I
I have generally found an advocate of the gold I
standard, whether he was in Nebraska or Mas
sachusetts; but when I found a man who
worked for his living I generally found a roan
who sympathized with you in your struggles.
[Cheers.]
My friends, we started out to fight this cam
paign on a great issue, and our opponents pre
tended that they were perfectly willing to
meet us in the fight. But they had not Rone
very far until they tried to get away from the
money question and get on to the tariff ques
tion, but when they tried to talk tariff they
found that the people wanted to put a prohibi
tory tariff on foreign financial policies before
th y discussed the rest of the schedule
[Laughter.]
When they wanted to talk tariff they found
that the farmers thought that if the money
question couid be settled by international
agreement they might settle the tariff ques
tion in the same way. [Chqersj They found
they could not bring the tariff question into
this campaign until after they had settled
whether or not this country has a right to
attend to its own buaines*and have a financial
policy suited to its own people. [Cheers.i
The Republicans have in their platform in
dorsed the financial policy of the present
administration, and that means more bonds
and less money, vrhile our policy means more
money and less bonds. After our opponents
had found themselves driven from every
battle-field upon which they dared to fight,
then in the closing days of the cam
paign they have attempted to resort tfÂ»
iraud and to forgery, and you have found
in this community letters purporting to
have been written by the chairman of the
Popu.ist committee ol this State, asking you
to save the Btate ticket and sacrifice the Na
tional ticket. I am authorized to denounce
the letter bs a fraud and a forgery by Mr. Ed
miston, whose name is signed to it [Great
applause.] But the fact that they resorted to
these things shows the desperation of their
cause. If they had a cbusp which appealed to
the people of this country it would not be
neceSFary for them to resort to fraud out here
*md to Intimidation mid iorce, wherever they
can resort to that anywhere. [Applause.]
Mr. Bryan then reverted to State issues
and spoke in advocacy of Governor Silas
A. Holcornb's candidacy for re-election.
Continuing he said:
We are not Reeking votes under false pre
tenses. 60 far as lam concerned I hnvo tried
to present before the people from the Miss, uri
River to the Atlantic coast the Issue of this
campaign.
I have tried to defend bimetallism as best I
could and show to the people tnat it is to the
interest oi 99 out of every 100 10 restore the
money of the constitution. [Cheers.] And
now on this last day of the campaign, when 1
come back among the people of my own State,
I want to be Iran* with them. I want to say
to th^m, if there is a man in Nebmsita who
thinks this Nation is not big enough to attend
to its own business, 1 do not waut his vote
[cheers], because 1 stand for an American
financial policy for the American people, and
it I can help it we will not consult any nation
on earth as to what our financial policy shttll
be. [Cheers.] If there i 6 anybody in this
State who believes that the honor of the Na
tion is safer in (he hands of syndicates than it
is in the hands of tbe peoole themselves I don't
want that person's vote because I cannot
carry out his ideas. [Cheers.] If there is any
body in the Stute who believes with that emi
nent divine tnat thÂ«* trouble in this country is
over-education among the farmers' sons Ido
not want his vote because that is not my idea,
my friends, of the trouble. [Applause.] In
stead of trying to stop education for fear
people will find out their condition I believe
in giving them more education and remedying
the condition itself. [Applause and cheers.]
Now, my iriends, I want to say when they
talk about wearing the yellow ribbon, I h-'Ve
wondered why i>ur farmers out here, if they
waut to show that they are for gold, do not
wear a bunch of yellow straw. It illustrates
the condition of this gold standard. [Laughter
and cheers] The gold standard has been a
great threshing machine, and it has done its
work well. It has separated the wheat from
the btraw and it has given the wheat to ;he
Wall street syndicates and left the 6tTÂ±w for
the former. [Great laughter and cheering.]
Stops of five ana six minutes only were
made by the candidate's tnin at towns
and villages between Hastings and Lin
coln, with the exception of Crete, where
ten minutes were spent. Harvard, Saxon
ville, button and Grafton turned out good
sized crowd 3. About 1000 people with a
sprinkling of the orange among them
were at each of the two last-named places
and hearty shouts were given for Mr.
Bryan. As the train drew out of Sutton a
number of small boys ran after it shout
ing lor McKnuey at the top of their
voices.
Mr. .Bryan started to speak from the
rear platform of the Idler at Fairmont,
where a crowd of abnu; 2000 awaited v.m,
but one of the local reception committee
persuaded him to make his address from
the more preferable temporary stand
aDout wuich most of the throng had
gathered. "It's the worst Re pubiican hole
in the couniry; you must no," said tne
committeeman, and Mr. Bryan went.
A brief speech that was almost fierce in
its delivery was made by the candidate at
Exeter. The line of demarcation between
his supporters and his opponents there
was well defined. To his leit were the
people wearing white budges inscribed
"Bryan," to his right a strong display of
orange color.
Mr. Bryan talked a minute or two to
those whose ribbons showed their intere-t
in his cause, and then turned quickly to
the people whose breasts bore evidence of
sympathy in another direction. To these
be said that in voting for a gold standard
they forgot the feeling of pride that must
come to every American in readlig the
pages of history devoted to the Revolu
tionary War. Emphasizing his words
with vigorous gestures, he told them iii a
voice almost tierce in passionate teeling
that unless they wanted their chiltiren to
feel the blush of shame for the action of
their fathers they should not vote for a
policy that allowed American finances to
be dominated by foreign influences,
Mr. Bryan's remarks worked his follow
ers up to a high of enthusiasm, and
they yelled with might and main. The
sixteen young men on white horses and
their companion on a dan animal became
so rilled with the spirit of the speech that
they deserted the seventeen young ladies
who composed the female exemplification
of t c silver rallying cry and dashed after
the train, shouting like mad for the Dem
ocratic candidate.
Young men in coats of old gold and
young women in golden-hned capes were
scattered through the crowd of 1200 people
at Friend. The 16 to 1 girls were also
there and assisted in the cheering that
i punctuated Mr. Brywn's remarks. Three
thousand composed the crowd at Dorches
ter, which also provided seventeen of its
buds for the ratio tableau. Crete was fa
miliar ground for the candidate. He had
held a joint debate on the money question
at the Cnautauqua there with Colonel Irish
just before the Chicago convention, and
on that occasion and in other visits had
become acquainted with the people.
About fifty boys, wearing bioad ribbons of
I yeilow, ran down the track to meet the
train, giving shrill pronunciation to Mc-
Kinley's name. More of them gathered
around the train when it halted. A num
ber of men and women wore thÂ« Repub
lican color, but they were in the minority
with those who "displayed the white.
With Mr. Bryan playing center rush in
the flying weilge formed*by those who ac
companied him a way was made through
the crowd to the baseball grounds, where '
the greater number of his supporters were J
gathered. His ten-minute speech was re- j
ceived with every mark of favor. At 5 ]
o'clock the candidate's special pulied out
for Lincoln, fifteen minutes late.
WELCOME AT LINOUN.
Bryan Make* a Farewell Appeal to Hit
Follower:
LINCOLN, Nebe..NÂ«>v. 2.â His home city
of Lincoln gave its final hearty ratification
of William J. Bryan's candidacy during
the brief half hour he spent there this
evening on his passage through this place
to Omaha from his Nebraska campaign
trip. Just before 6 o'clock, when the sun
was disappearing beyond the prairie hori
zon line, his special train reached the
Burlington station. The Traveling Men's
Silver Club, the Bryan Home Guards, the
Mary Bryan Club, composed of women,
men on horseback and several other or
ganizations composed the procession that
escorted the candidate and Mrs. Bryan to
the Lincoln hotel.
As the procession passed along the short
distance between the station and the
hotel an artillery salute was fired from
the Postofflce square Ninth street, run
ning between the Lincoln and the square,
was packed with people, and when Mr.
and Mrs. Bryan stepped on the hotel bal
cony a great cheer went up. There was
nothing to mar the demonstration given
Lincoln's most noted citizen. It was
hearty and sincere, and the candidate
showed his appreciation in his speech.
,Mr. Bryan needed no introduction. In
the course of his remarks he reiterated the
statement made just after his nomination
that if elected he would not be a candi
date for a second term. It was his prin
cipal closing speech of the campaign and
was delivered in a clear, strong voice that
reached every person in the audience.
The speech follows:
Ladles and gentlemen: This is the last op
portunity that I shall have to address the
people 01 Lincoln before they sit in Judgment
upon the issues presented in this campaign
which will decide the financial policy ot this
Nation for the next four years. Three Na
tional parties placed in my bands the standard
upon which was written "free and unlimited
coinage of silver at 16 to 1, without waiting
for the aid or consent of any other nation."
For three months I have done what I could
to present this question to the American
people and have traveled from Nebraska to the
Atlantic, and everywhere I have preached the
same doctrine and advocated the same princi
ples. [Cheers ] Everywhere I have found
those who believe with us, and the zeal of the
bimetalllsts who live alo g the Eastern coast
Is Â»s great as the zeal of the bimetallists of Ne
braska. [Applause and cheering.] They called
itaseciiunal question which we began, but
they have found out that it is not a sectional
Question. It is a great controversy between
the money jower mid the common people of
all this country. [Applause.] :
The Republican party started out to make
the tariff question at issue in this campaign,
but ft you will go among any group of persons
where politics Is discussed you will find what
a failure they have made in getting the tariff
question in the campaign. The Republican
party attempted a fraud upon the American
people in iÂ«s financial plank. Under the hope
<>( International bimetallism it started out to
fasten the gold standard upon the American
people. ItfiÃs been aided In this work by a
few former Democrats who have been advocat
ing tne sold standard, but in order to keep up
tnÂ« iraud they have rretended to favor I'almer
and Buekner when they have worked for the
Republican ticket. [Applause and cheers.l
You can see how the campaign has been con
ducted. The Republicans have not dared to
advocate the- gold standard as a good thing
because their platform pledges the Republican
party to get ria of 11 as soon as other radons
will help us. But as they are not able to
openly advocate the gold standard they help
the boltine I Democrats, who can preach what
the Republicans do not dare to preach, and
they aasHer the same purpose.- [Ur-at ap

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
which^we have had to fight. They have toM
us that the great iateresis of society were
Rcainst us. Yes, certain great Interests have
been. The trusts have been against us, but the
trusts are no more against me than I am
against the trusts. [Long and continued ap
plttuse and cheers.] The syndicates which
have been pellinfc bonds for the Government
are against me, but, my friends, they have
reason to be, because if I am elected they will
no longer bleed the American people. [Con
tinued applause.] They say that the corpora
tions are against us. Yes, tuauy oi them are,
and they have reason to be, because we believe
.that the corporation is a creature of law and
that the Government which created it is still
greater ihan the corporation and should com
pel it to obey the law. [Great applause mud
continued cheering.]
We have felt the influence of some of these
corporations. We know what it is to have
them say to men who are with us that if they
vote our ticket they must De discharged and
lose their bread and butter. [Continued ap
plause.] My friends, they know that if we
succeed in this campaign there will be legisla
tion which will punish the man who attempts
to deprive another of the right of c tlzenship.
[Applause.] They tell us that the National
oanlts are ..gainst us. Yes, some of them are,
because, my triends, we believe Uiat the green
back as we have it to-. ay is better than to re
tire the greenbacks a d iÂ»B'je bonds aud give
the batiks the bent-liv of the interest.
My rlends, we have found men advocating
honest money who were so afraid of payinn
their debts in dollars tnat are not honest that
in order to avoid all poasiMlity of mistake
they refused to pay their debts at all. We
stand iv this campaign lor a reversal of tne
financial po icy which, hat cursed this coun
try for twenty years. We are In favor of re
storing the gold and silver coinage of the con
stitution. We are in iavor of having an Amer
ican financial policy for the American people.
We do not expect the support of those who
doubt the ability of the American people to
attend to their own business. [App ausc and
cheers.] We don't expect the support of those
who have more faitu in loreign financiers
than they have in our own peop.e. We don't
expect the support 01 those who would ratuer
trust the destinies of 70,000.000 of Americans
to a few foreign financiers than trut the des
tinies of our people in their cwn hands,
[lirfat cheering.] But. my iriends, while we
have against us many of these influences
which are considers i great and potent, we
have on our side those who believe in the old
fashioned idea of government â that it should
give eqaai rights ;o all and special privileges
to no one. [Cheers.]
My friends, to-morrow is the day upon which
you register your will; to-morrow is the <iay
when by your ballot you describe the govern
ment under which you desire to live. If you
Qesire a government of syndicates, by syndi
cates and for syndicates, you have a right to it,
and you can cast your Influence with thuse
who are against us. [Cheers.]
If you still believe in the government that
Jefferson advocated, the government that Lin
coin desiredâ a government of the people, by
t tie people and for the people â you must join
with those who believe in a government by
the people. [Applause.] So lar as I am per
sonally concerned this election will simply de
termine whether I shall remain a private
citizen or occupy the most exalted position
within the power of man to confer upon a fel
low-man. It will determine whether I shall
remain with you to uphold as best I can he
hand of toe one who is elected until his policy
can be reversed at the polls, or whether I
shall Uepart from you to be gone four years
and then return to live with you the rest of
my dÂ»TB. [Great applause and cheering.] I
have stated that if elected I shall not be ab
sent from you more than four years. When I
stated it I meant it, and 1 want you <o believe
in my sincerity when I say so. I believe that
the office is attended with duties so great,
with responsibilities so beavy, that the man
who occupies it ought to have no personal am
bition beyond proving himself worthy of the
confidence of those who elected him. [Cheer
in?.]
If elected I shall de.vote four years of my life
to the service of my oountry, feeling that when
that has been done all has been done in the
war of honor that can be done, and then I
shall rejoice again to be a private citizen in
this Nation, where to be a citizen is greater
than to be akm gr. [Applause]
My friends, I remember that when Â« little
lets than two years ago I returned to this city j
after completing four years la Congress, you j
met â â¢ c and extended to me n welcome wnich :
touched my haart and I want to say to you
th >i nothing you can do in the future can
withdraw from me whas you have done in the
past. You may turn against me if you like,
but, my friends, you can never undo what
you have already done, nor can you take from
me tbe feeling <>i gratitude which I entertain
toward those wh.se kindness and confidence
first gave me an opportunity to bocome inter
ested in public questionsâ the kindness and
the confidence ol those who enabled me to be-
I gin the great fight In which 1 am now en
gaged. [App!auÂ«e ]
My friends, I want you to believe me when I
say tnat I have enjoyed the opportunity of de
fending bimetallism because I believe It is a
righteous cause, and I want you to believe that
I would rather stay among you as a private
citizen and be permitted still to raise my voice
against what 1 conceive to be a crime against
tne human race than to enjoy all the honors
in Christendom, if 1 had to j >in in tbe con
spiracy. [Great appiause and cheering.]
And now let me ask of you that are inter
ested in the result of this campaign to
lose no effort to have the vote recorded to
morrow exactly as the people desire to vote,
lam seeking no involuntary support. I have
said and I repeat that I do not want a vote
unless there is behind the vote the heart of
the person who casts the vote. [Great ap.
: plause.]
The work which lies before a President who
i goes into office with the desire to reform a
I financial policy and to drive the trusts and
syndicates from this land will be hard|Â«nough
if he is supported by the peop.e; his work
would be impossible if he were not supported
by them. [Cheers.] I want you, if you are in
earnest, to give us a Senate and a Congress, as
well as an electoral vote. [Cries of "We
will!"] It you are in earnest, 1 want your
earnestness to be manifested in a clean sweep,
and then, my friends, if by the suffrage of my
countrymen 1 am made their cnJef executive
I will promise you that no Dower in this
country or in- any foreign land will prevent
the restoration of the money of the constitu
tion nmong our peop.e. [Tremendous ap

FROM LINCOLN TO OMAHA.
Plenty of Talk by the Candidate of
Three Parties. _
OMAHA, Nebs., Nov. 2.â Three stops
were made by Mr. Bryan's special on the
run from Lincoln 'to Omaha. They were
at Greenwood, Ashland and Gretna, and
at each the candidate was enthusticaliy
greeted. His remarks at Gretna were
rather interesting. This is what he said:
Ladies and Gentlemen: When I began my
first canvass for Congress in 1890 I came to
Gretna, the strongest Democratic precinct in
the only certain county of the district, and
hen I came here I remember that you raised
the first pole ever raised in my houor and put
upon it a banner bearing the inscription "W.
J. Bryan, M. C." Six years have passed since
then, and I now come among you on the last
day, and in the evening of that day, when in
stead of being a candidate for Congress I am
the candidate of three parties for the Presi
dency. 1 remember with grateful apprecia
tion the nandsome vote that I received in this
precinct six years ago, and I am going to
watch the returns to-morrow night and see if
Gretna does as well this year. [Cheers.]

A CLASH WAS PKARED.
So JRepublicin Parader* Did Hot ilingle
With BruaniU*. j
OMAHA, Nebb., Not. William J.
Bryan's personal campaign came to an
end in Omaha to-night. Never before in
the history of the city has party feeling
run so high on the eve of a National elec
tion and ominous rumors that pointed to
a personal conflict between supporters of
the great National tickets caused an un
easy feeling throughout the community.
Fortunately no clash occurred. ; An agree
ment had been reached between the Re
publican and Democratic local managers
by which the McKinlcy demonstration
would not come in contact with the
crowds that gathered to hear Bryan. This
was carried out and the imposing Repub
lican parade did not appear on Farnam
street, the. principal thoroughfare, until
Mr. Bryan had left it and begun bis round
of speech-making. % /,-,'
Shortly after y.S'i o'clock Mr. Bryan
reached Omaha after a hard day's work.
He had visited four of the six Congres
sional districts in Nebraska and' made
eighteen i speeches. . including one .in his
home town. An almost frenzied crowd of
enthusiasts greeted him nere and followed
his carria c for a mile through the streets
to Boyd's : Theater, where he spoke first.
| Unlike the Republicans, no organized
i parade had been arranged by the. I)-mo
| cratic managers, and tbe band, the Jack
sonian Club, the Veterans* Bryan Club,
composed -of old soldiers,' and a number of
other supporters fell into line and in
discriminately composed his escort,
â j The/.-; Republican V demonstration .was
; more pretentious. Scores of organizations,
I nearly all bearing torches, formed a pro
cession . that took an hour in passing a
given point. Every brass ban. l in Omaha
and vicinity-, had been secured for tne pa
rale. Despite the agreement between the \
opposing political parlies the Democratic
managers claimed to be fearful ol trouble
in view of statements that the Republican
organizations intended to gather about the
places where Mr. Bryan was scheduled to
speak and attempt to howl him down.
That was the given reason lor not an
nouncing the time Mr. Bryan would keep
each engagement.
Continuous cheerine from the mob fol
lowing the carriage in which the candidate
and Mrs. Bryan were seated and from the
thousands along the si'lewalfia marked
Mr. Bryan's progress from the station up
Farnam street to Boyd's Theater. Enttiusi
aÂ«m was rampant. Not an inch of space
was available in the theaier when he arrived
anu he received an ovation there and
from a 'tremendous throng outside. His
speech was on the lines of that delivered
at Hustings to-day. Another demonstra
tion occurred inside and outside Washing
ton Hall and then the candidate pro
ceeded in hia carriage to Germania Hall,
where he talked to an audience of natives
ot the Fatherland about what Prince Bis
marck had to say about bimetallism.
Metz Hall, in the Bohemian district;
Morao's Hall, where the meeting was
under the direction of the Swedish Bi
metallic League, and Creighton Hall fol
lowed in turn. Each was crowded to the
doors and Mr. Bryan was received with
the customary wild excess of partisan
emotion. Governor Holcomb spoke at
Moran's in support of the Democratic
ticket just before Mr. Bryan appeared.
Creigbton Theater, in the same building
with the ball of t at name, was the scene
of the last speech delivered by Candidate
Brvan in bis remarsable campaign.
These were Mr. Bryan's concluding
words, hb last message to the free-coinage
forces:
Do you wonder that we have been able to
conduct this campaign ? My iriends. we have
been able to conduct It by the unselfish devo
tion 01 that multitude of men â Democrats,
Populists, Republicansâ who see what the gold
standard menus and, seeing it, have been
willing to fight it in order to save their chil
dren aid their children's children from this
curse of cold. They tell us that we must bow
down and worship the golden call. I say, my
friendÂ«, tbat the American people will not
bow down. They will vote to restore the gold
and silver coinage of the constitution and lead
in the restoration of bimetallism throughout
the world.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan will spend the night
at the Paxton Hotel and at 8:30 o'clock in
tjie morning will leave over the Burlington
for Lincoln, where the candidate wili cast
his vote and await tbe returns.
RICH COAD DISCOVERY.
Vatt bums Offered by a Syndicate for
Lund in Western Ontario.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 2.â A Sun
special from Toronto, Ont., says: Four
months ago there was a discovery of coal
in a fertile district of Algoma, Western
Ontario. It did not take long for the re
port to spread, and in a very short time
the Jbehigh Valley people had dispatched
experts to the scene of the discovery with
instiuctlons to test the coal thoroughly,
and. if it was, in their opinion, of the
quality represented to at once buy up the
surrounding country and secure an option
on the district. -
But when the Lehigh Valley people had
made up their minds to buy it they found
Canadian capitalists had eot in before
them and got a claim on the property.
The Lehigh Valley combine has not given
up hope of securing the coal mines. A
proposition is now before the syndicate, iv
' which the combine offers to pay more
than $1,000,000 if the present holders of
the options will sell out to them the whole
district, which the syndicate has now
secured. The advisability of accepting Ihe
offer is being considered. The syndicate
would prefer to start a Canadian company
with $1,000,000 capital >tocK.
William Wilson, a representative of the
Canadian syndicate, has â  gone to New
York to meet capitalists there who may
offer more for" the property than the Le
high Valley. The coal is 01 good quality,
and its discovery in Algoma is considered
even more valuable than that of the gold
mines. -â -.r. Â.-> 1* Â,^, ââ¦;*,._-.... . .... '
A PENITENTIARY BATTLE
Two Desperate Convicts Over
power a Keeper and Secure
His Revolver.
Another Keeper Then Disarmed and
the Prisoners Nearly Succeeded
ia Escrping.
BUFFALO, N. V., Nov. 2.â William
Odell and Fred Williams, serving a five
years' term in the Eiie County Peniten
tiary for burglary, made a bold attempt to
escape late Saturday afternoon. Williams
is 28 and Odell 27 years old. They have
been in prison just two years. Both
worked in tbe overall factory. When
Keeper John Hannan walked up the aisle
of the overall department about 4 o'clock
with a stack of garments in bis arms Odell
approached him with a garment iv his
hand. The keeper stopped, expecting
that Odell had some criticism to make of
tbe workmanship,on tbe garment.
Odeil grabbed f im, pinning his arms to
bis side. Hannan yelled and Keeper
Clark Crosby ran to bis assistance. Before
be reacned him Williams bounded over a
table and snatched Hannan's revolver
from his pocket. He turned it on Crosby
and oruered him to put up his bands.
They went up.
Then Williams took Crosby's revolver
and, passing it over to Odell, the latter re
leased his hold on Hannan and put the
revolver to his face. The two keepers,
with their bands above their beads, were
commanded to march toward the door ot
the shop,
Just then Keeper Burdick strolled in
from thÂ« packing department. Odell took
his gun off Hannau lon* enough to order
Burdick to throw up bis hands. Walking
Hannan and Crosby before them Odell
and Williams passed out of the shop door
into the prison yard. Before them, 150
yards away, was tbe prison gate, whicn
had just been opened to let a wagon of
supplies pass out. The convicts had timed
their uprising so as to reach the gate be
fore it had closed.
As soon as the convicts passed out of the
shop, leaving Buraick uncovered, he ran
to the prison office and cave the alarm,
which arouÂ«ed all the keepers and guards,
including those posted on the prison wall.
The convicts heard the alarm, abandoned
Hnnnan and Crosby and ran for the gate.
The big doors were just coming to as
they started full speed toward them,
Gus Durstein, who has charge
of the gate, saw the men approaching,
heard the shouts of the alarmed guards,
and, drawing the eates together quickly,
snapDsd a padlock on them and sprinted
for Ihe prison office, for he was unarmed.
"Stop!" cried Odell. "Stop, or I will
hre. And without slowing up at all he
let fire. The bullet knocked a chip from
the stone wail into Durston's face. Wil
liams fired again, but the shot went wild.
The breathless man came to a dead stop
against the wall. Looking through the
wicket they saw Keeper James Warner,
vho had heard the alarm and passed out
of the office door into the street to head
them off in case they caught Durston and
compeljed him to open the uates for them.
OJell fired a random shot, which sent
Warnerchasing up tb* street. He came
back r^-enforced b> five guards armeu
witbrfl's, while the guards on tne wall
hnd taken their places prepared to tire.
Wiiliams and Odell saw that t bey were
irapped and they threw their revolvers
over the fence and surrendered. They
were shackled and led to the dungeon.

Irish's Pursuit of Bryan
Not the Success An
ticipated.
Wreck of the Special at the
First Stopping P^ace Caused
a Death-
THEN EGGS WERE THROWN.
However, at Other Towns He Was
Rsspected and G.ven Quite
an Ovation.
LINCOLN. Nebr., Nov. 2.â The tour of
the John P.lrish party, which followed
Candidate Bryan to-day, was marred by
one distressing and fatal accident and a
series of unpleasant incidents. The spe
cial train bearing the California gold
standard advocate was partially wrecked
at Malcolm, the first stopping piece after
leaving Lincoln, and John M. Tipling, a
well-known traveling man of this city,
was killed.
The special had been given the right of
way, but by some misunderstanding an
accommodation freieht was allowed to
remain on the main track as the special
thundered 'n. Mr. Tiphug was in the
caboose of ihe freight and in attempting
to jump was caught between the caboose
and freight car abead and fatally crushed.
The body was brought to Lincoln.
Mr. Irish and hia party were badly
shaken up, but not seriously injured. At
Sutton, where the crowd which welcomed
Mr, Bryan yet remained, Mr. Irish was
greeted with a shower of eggs and other
missiles, one of which broke a car window
and injured a lady. At Grafton hoots
and jeers greeted him, and at Harvard
the same reception was accorded â not,
however, without cheers from Republi
cans. In other towns he was given a
respectful bearing, at times amounting to
an ovation.
See to it that a Republican Assembly
is elected, for a United States Senator
is to be elected. Do not vote for a Dem

bad participated in tbe big political de
monstrations, and revelry was rampant.
Shortly before this Chief of Police Wise
had backed his horse into a crowd on
Pine street and was greeted with oaths and
catcalls. The Chief then rode into Court
sireet and a great crowd gathered about
him. Fieht policem n were with him,
and arrested men until tbe police cells
were full, in a vain attempt to break up
the crowd.
As the Courthouse clock struck 12 the
Chief rose in His saddle and addressed
the crowd, commanding them to dis
perse; but he was greeted witn a storm
of jeers and curses. Instead of charging
the crowd, he retreated, and was followed
by the mob, who continued their impreca

decided to send a hose cart to the scene
and deluge tbe mob with water, but re
consid- red, and had a fire engine sent out
as a ruse. It worked, and tbe crowd fol
lowed, but quickly returned. Then Police
Captain Worral and a squad charged the
crowd, and by dint of "club persuasion"
dispersed them, but only after numerous
arrests.

CUBA'S INSANE FRIEND,
Young Powers Traced to Union
City, Perm., and Again
Lost Sipht Of.
Had a Littla Bey With H m nnd Was
Trying to GA Permission
to Preach.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 2.â Albert D.
Powers, formerly manager of the Cuban
Relief Bureau in this city, whose mys
terious disappearance some weeks ago led
to the belief of foal play, is alive. He
was located by the police at Union City,
Term., and a telegram from that place
j'esterday said that Powers came 10 that
city yesterday morning from Martin,
Term., where he had been for several days
painting signs.
He had a little boy from Martin with
him and was going around trying to get
permission to preach in the Courthouse
when he was met on the street by E. C.
Hawes, a relative. Hawes asked Him
what he was doing there. Ho said he was
lost and bad not seen bis wife for six years.
Then Hawes invited him to his house to
take supper. He said he was in no condi
tion to meet his family, but would go and
dre<=s and come buctc.
Mr. Hawes went to the telegraph office
to let Powers' father know he had found
his Bog. He left an officer to watch the
young man while be was gone, but the
officer let him go. Powers went to the
little boy ana said he was discovered by a
relative and must leave at once, which he
did, going south.
He has been lor some time about Fulton
acting strangely. His mind is reported to
be impaired. W.iile at Fulton he made a
coffin and said he was (foing to bury a man
there for three aays and resurrect him.
Young Powersâ he is 28 years oldâ has
been prominent in Owensboro since he
attained his majority. He had proved
himself a good business man and had
worked his way to a position paying $2500
a .rear. Ardent in religion, he had been
enthusiastic in support of the young
men's Cuban and similar organizations.
A few months ago he interested himself
in the cause of Cuba, and bis enthusiasm
led him to come to Chicago and undertake
the establishment of a great bureau for
collecting clothing, money and supplies
for the insurgents. The omce was ouened
without the knowledge of the association
in New York, and it was not until Powers
notified them that he had five carloads of
supplies and $5000 for the committee that
they began an investigation. An officer of
tbe association, Don Quesada, was set here
to investigate Powers' office, and when he
expressed some doubt tne latter turned
over $5000 of his own money as a guaranty
of good faith. He disappeared a few days
later.

Chairman Hanna Receives Cheer
ing Assurances From This
Coast.
EJECTION EVE STOEIES PASS.
So Desperate Are Bryan Democrats
That They Prepare Their Ex
cuses for Defeat
CHICAGO, 111.. Nov. 2.â Weather con
ditions and predictions made by the Gov
ernment experts took precedence over
Presidential politics at National campaign
headquarters here today. There were
only a few of the Democratic and Repub
lican leaders at their desks.
The day was not without its liveliness,
however. Telegrams passed to and fro
from Democratic headquarters relating to
alleged discoveries of plots to commit
election frauds with marked ballots and
to 'corrupt voters with money. Chairman
Hanna did not get any telegrams of that
character.
Republicans usually hope and pray for
fine weather in order to get out their full
vote, but according to the prognostications
of Professor Garriott of the local weather
bureau there will be rain in this city and
State, Indiana and Wisconsin, to be fol
lowed by cooler and fair weather, but he
does not Bay whether the improvement
will, come before or after the closing of the
polls. Professor Moore, the nead of the
Weather Bureau at Washington, takes a
more hopeful view of the conditions which
may prevail in the middle Yves tern States
. during the hours the polls are open. He
believes tnere will , be no serious interfer
ence with the travel of voters by wind,
rain or storms. 9EH
Chairman Hanna and bis associates
who remained at the headquarters to-day
expressed their indifterenc-* as to what
the weather would be, saying that Mc-
Kinley would be elected by such an over
whelming vote that they could afford to !
lose some stay-tt-homes on account of
any bad weather that might come. Mr.
Hanna received a few final telegrams of a
cheerful tenor from the Pacific Coast.
The chairman of the Oregon State Com
mittee wired that the poll of the State
just completed showed 4500 majority for
McKinlfy, and that the State is abso
lutely sure* The California State chair
man' telegraphed that the State could be
surely depended upon to cast its electoral
vote for McKinley. From the chairman
of the Washington State Committee came
a message that the State might go for
Bryan, being very much in doubt, bat
that the Republicans would elect their
Sta.ie and Congressional tickets and carry [
the Legislature. I
Executive Committeeman Lcland, who i
has been in Kansas for some time, wired
Mr.' Hanna guaranteeing the electoral
vote of that State for McKinley.
â¢ Mr. Hanna received congratulations
from prominent Chicago and other citi
zens as to his management of the cam
paign and all who called at headquarters
to say good-by to Major McKinley's
, right-hand man were positive in their
belief that victory had practically been
won. Mr. Hanna had nothing new to add
'to his predictions when be took the night
train for his home in Cleveland. After
,â¢ voting he will go to Canton to-morrow
and return in time to receive the election
returns in Cleveland. .
Extra precautions have been taken by
the police department :of this city to se- ;
cure a fair election and equal rights to all ;
' voters who come to the polls. Persons
not having business at the polls will be
kep"t 100 feet away by the police and the
passageway will be cleared lor that dis
tance at every booth. The department is
determined to close every saloon in the
- city and every entrance will be guarded to
prevent secret violation of the election
law in this regard. The police have been
. especially instructed to be neutral toward
all voters and preserve the peace .at all
hazards.
Senator Jones sent the following tele
gram to the chairman of each State Com
mi ttee to-day :
J. Richie, Deputy United States Marshal,
wired me from Lawrenceville, 111. : "The plan
of the Republicans to carry Illinois is to have
official tickets in the hands of the judge and
as the voter presents his ballot to be deposited
In the ballot- the judge is to put in a
straight Republican ticket in its stead We
have captured a man here with 100 tickets
end $400 in Cash. He has . weakened and
given the whole plan away." This plan will
probably be attempted throughout your State
It is absolutely necessary that honest men
organize vigilance committees in til ourcoun
ties and townships if possible for the purpose
of preventing the consummation of this vil
lainy. ' Please take Immediate and vigorous
â¢teps to call the attention of the public to this
plan. It seems that the Republicans will hesi
tate at no villainy to steal the election. Let
this be Known. James K. Jones.
Republican State Chairman Hitch and
National Coraniitteeman Jamieson denied
any knowledge of a plot to steal Illinois 1
or any county thereof, and they place no
credence in the report from Lawrence
ville,, suspecting that it was only circu
lated as an election-eve dodge, so as to ex
plain the defeat which they had in store
for the : Democrats in Illinois to-morrow.
The scheme o! passing a marked ballot is
old, they said, and no smart man would
try it ; Chairman Hitch telegraphed for
a report from Lawrenceville on the
aliegeo case.
Senator Jones received a telegram from
Indiananolis claiming that Indiana would
give Bryan 15,000 plurality. Anotner
telegram came 10 him from S. W. Bedford
of Lacrosse, Wis., alleging that the
superintendents of Wisconsin railroads
were changing the runs of their employes
so that Bryan men could not get time to
vote. U r
The silver forces in this city have ar
ranged an election day surprise for their
opponents. The law gives to each candi
date on the ballot the right to have a
representative in each polling-place when
the count of the ballots begins, but it has
been customary for a few , representatives
of each party only to be present to watch
the count and take cognizance of any dis
pute over ballots between the judges. The
silver people, however, have made secret
arrangements for thirty men to be at each
pollint-place when the count begins.'one
for each candidate, which means an army
of 27,000 men, there being over 900 voting
precincts in the i city. . ; The Republicans
have arranged" for only the usual number
of watchers. These 27,000 silverites 1 are
expected to have a disturbing: effect on
the county and jeopardize the peace of the
polling- places. On . the other hand : the
Republicans, who have control : : of the
municipal government, have arranged
.with the Fire Department to have streams
u Wslter ;urned on any obstreperous mob
which may threaten any polling-place.
WILL KINDN OF HEATHER.
Conditions That May < aH *c Some Trou
ble in the North and East.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Noy. 2. -The
meteorological forecasters are most uncer
tain about the conditions which will pre
vail in the doubtful States of the Midclle
West to-morrow. Recognizing the creat
importance upon the election's result of
snowstorms, sunshine and good roads,
speeia. effort* have ' been made by the
Chief of the Weather Bureau to foretell
accurately the conditions. The ominous
"low" central over lowa causes concern.
It is conceded, however, not as bad look
ing as bucli "lows" usually are, for it has
hun around twenty-four hours now with
out developing any damage.
There ib absolutely nothing in the
weather conditions to prevent every
farmer in the New England, Middle States j
ami the South from reaching the polls',
however distant, for in these sections the
roads are at their best and are sure to re
main so for several days at least. The
mountain States are also dry, but the
western slope of the Mississippi Valley
has been thoroughly soaKea in the last
three or four days, and even in Kansas
and Nebraska teaming is so heavy that
another genorat shower would make very
poor roads almost impassable. Tuis state
of affairs is worse in Oregon and Washing- j
ton than any where else.
There is pretty sure to be r i m and per
haps snow in Western Michigan, Wiscon
sin and Minnesota, with showers in not
sufficient intensity to deter ardent voters
from voting in Michigan. But a 200-mile
circle, with Sprinpfield, 111., as a center,
the line cutting well into Indiana, Illinois,
lowa, Missouri and Kentucky, is the area
that might be affected by the only "low"
on the United States map. " Here the
Weather Bureau scarps are -looking out
for squalls.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 2.â The Weather
Bureau issues the following special bulle
tin for Tuesday:
"G nerally fair weather will prevail in
the States of Missouri, Colorado, Wyo
ming and Kansas. Rain or snow will fall
in Minnesota and Montana. In lowa and
Missouri rain will be followed by fair
weather in central and western portions
Tuesday. Rain is indicated for Wisconsin,
Upper Mic igan and Western Lower
Michigan. In Illinois and Indiana show
ers will occur, with prospects for fair
weather in Illinois Tuesday afternoon."

UTAH IS CONCEDED.
But the Republicans Will Control the
Legislature.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Nov. 2.â To-night
the Democratic silver and Republican and
Populist fusion managers claim Bryan
will carry the State by 35.000 majority,
and the Democrats claim King's election
to Congress Dy 8000 majority. The Demo
crats and Populists claim they will nave
| forty-five members of the Legislature out
I of sixty-one, and that a Democrat will be
elected to succeed Arthur Brown as United
I Senator.
The McKinley men concede that the
I State will go for Bryan, but say the ma
j jority will be very much smaller than
claimed Dy tbe fusion people.
Chairman Holmes of the Republican
State Committee claims that Holbrook
j will be elected to Congress by a small ma
! jority and that the combined gold and sil
| ver Republicans will have a majority of
i the Legislature, but is not oveiconhdent in
' either assertion.
The fact that sample ballots were dis
[ tributed in nearly all the Mormon meet
ing houses oa Sunday evening; by the
bishops, marked in lavor of the Republi
can candidates for the Legislature leads
to the conclusion that the Mormon church
wants a Republican Legislature and this
isa strong point for that party. In these
ballots the Presidential electors and can
didates for Congress were not marked.
THE STREGGLE IN IDAHO.
Fusionists Claim to Have 20,000 Totes
for Bryan.
BOISE CITY, Idaho, Nov. 2.â ln Idaho
the Democratic, silver Republican and
Populist fusionist claim 20,000 votes for
the Bryan electors and accord the Me
| Kiniey electors 6000, while the McKinley
people claim 10.000. In regard to the
legislative ticket it appears as if (he
cr eater part of the strength of tbe Mc-
Kinley ites would be thrown to the Demo
cratic-Populist fusion ticket leaving the
silver Republicans to go it alone. The
reason of this strange alignment is to de
feat Dubois for Senator. To-night Dubois'
friends claim forty-five out of tbe seventy
I members of the Legislature while the
combination against him say he will not
have more than twenty-five.
For Congress Borah's friends, the silver
Republicans, seem the most confident.
They claim the A. P. A. vote will go to
Borah. Morrison, th McKinley ite, also
i claims the A. P. A. vote. Gunn, the
I Demo-Populist candidate, antagonized the
j A. P. A. people and he will be scratched
!by them. If the A. P. A. unite oa Mor
rison or Borah the probability is they can
elect either and the chances se?m to favor
Borah. It is claimed that a large propor
tion of the Mormon vote will go to Mor
rison.
FAVORABLE TO REPUBLICANS.
That IÂ» the Trend of Sentiment in the
btnte of Nebraska.
LINCOLN, Nebb., Not. 2.â Eliminating
the effect of William J. Bryan's trip
through Nebraska to-day, which none
deny has been a factor in bis benefit, the
political trend o; the State for tbe past
thirty-six hours has been favorable to the
Republicans. For this condition of affairs
tne Populist supporters of Mr. Bryan have
men in their own ranks to blame. The
meetings of to-day and Saturday nigm
were marked at a number of towns by
overt acts, such as throwing eggs at Re
publican speakers and burning Republican
banners, and the reaction has set in.
Aside from this there has been nothing to
change the estimate either way. The vote
will be close in any event, and it is ques
tionable if tne result on even heads of
tickets will be definitely known before
Thursday. If be ting is any indication,
Bryan men have a trifle the best of it. No
large wagers have been made, or odds
offered by either Â«ide. Mr. Bryan's home
county is claimed by the Republicans by
2000; but bis supporters insist that it is
far too large.
IOWA IS REPUBLICAN.
But democrats and I'opuliftt let Claim
the Mate.
DBS MOINES, lowa, Nov. 2.â At 10
o'clock to-night the local weather predic
tion is for the StaU. of lowa generally fair
and warmer. The barometer is rising and
stands at 30. Prospects are for excellent
weather throughout the State to-morrow.
, Latest claims trom Republican head
quarters are that the State will go 75.000
Plurality or about 65,030 majority for Me-
Kinley. The Democrats and. Populists,
who have fuÂ«ed, claim ;he State for Bryan
by from 15,000 to 25,000. The registration
is the largest ever known in ail the citie*
and towns, and the poll will be 25,000
larger than ever before.

IN THE GUVERNATORIAL RACE.
It It the Chief Center of Interest in
Colorado.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 2â There has
been no change in the political situation
in this State during the past forty-eight
hours. The indications are thai the
Bryan electors will carry the State with
100.000 votes. The Republicans claim
45,000 votes will be cast for McKinley.
The chief interest of the campaign in
this State has centered iti the guber
natorial race. Ex-Governor Adams (D. )
and Judge Bailey (Pop.), the nominees of
their respective parties for Governor, have
made a hot campaign, and to-ni lit both
are claiming victory. The betting is
slightly in favor of Adams. The weather
to-morrow promises to bs line.

"THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS SAFE
LOB ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 2.â At the close of a hotly contested campaicn I look for to-morrow to bring a decided victory
to the Republican and sound-money forces in Southern California. Republican organization here has been a very complete
one. A campaign committee was organized two months ago composed of the chairmen of ihe auxiliary committee of the
State Central Committee, County Central Committee, Sixth District Committee, Federation of Republican Clubs and Business
Men's Sound Money Club and three members of the latter organization. This consolidated committee managed the campaign,
and divided the work so that nothing was neglected and nothing done twice.
Hundreds of meetings have been held, thorough canvasses have been made, and nearly 2000 men will be on duty at the
polls in this city to-morrow under the direction of our organization. lam confident that the counties south of Tehachapi will
give McKinley 5000 plurality; that McLachlan will be re-elected to Congress; that Bulla will be elected State Senator, and that
four out of six Republican Assemblymen will be elected in Los Angeles County.
Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Bernardino, Orange and Riverside counties will, in my opinion, give McKinley majorities
averaging 250 each. San Diego should make a stand off, and Los Angeles will give enough to make up the 5000. This county
will cast 35,000 votes, an increase of 10,000 over that of 1894. This new vote is largely Republican, and I claim three-fifths of it
in favor of McKinley to two-fifths in favor of Bryan. It is upon this estimate and upon our canvass, made with unusual care,
that I base my claims. H. Z. Osborne,

PREPARED FOR EMERGENCIES.
Troops in Readiness in Kentucky to
Suppress -my Trouble.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nor. 2.â A Louis
ville (Ky.) special says: When State
Chairman Roberts closed the Republican
headquarters last ni.ht he asserted that
McKuiley would carry the State by from
10,000 to 15,000. His private telegram to
National Chairman Hanna claimed eight
of the eleven Congressmen.
Tne Democrats still claim tbe State by
20,000. Tb<Â» most impartial give the State
to McKinley by 6000 to 7000. About $3000,
in small suras, was bet here on the result
of tbe State.
It is rumored arrangements have' been
forwarded to armories recently and every
militia company has been put in readiness
to see there is no trouble.
General Castleman and Governor Brad
ley both denied that troops had been called
out to preserve order at the polls. No
orders have been received by any military
company, bnt it is known that there was
a recent communication between Governor
Bradley and General Castleman, who has
sent his troops and officers a general order
to hold tnemselves in readiness at short
notice.
Little tronble is expected outside the
big cities. Mayors have been ordered to
quell the slightest disturbance and extra
policemen have been sworn in. Saloons
have been ordered closed.
HEARST IN THE SWIM.
Joins the Speculators in Betting on the
HUetton.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 2.â The scenes
in the corridors of the uptown hotels
were exciting to-night, and the Fifth
Avenue, Hoffman, Imperial and Bartholdi
hotels were thron -ed with the partisans
of McKinley and Hobart, and some Bry
anites ventured within their portals with
the object of betting upon the result. The
Hoffman House lobby, corridor and cafe
were thronged with wearers of Bryan
badges, who kept up a continuous shout
ing for their favorite. At the Imperial
there was a mixed assemblage, and at the
Bartholdi the crowd was thoroughly Bry
anite.
The betting opened 6 to 1 that Bryan
would be defeated, but along toward mid
night 4 and 5 to 1 were the best that could
be had. Colonel Barry Swords bet $1200 to
$400 on the general re.-nili, taking tbe Me-
I Kmley end; General Powell Clayton bet
$5000 even with a Philadelphia man who
would not give his name that Mckinley
would receive 150,000 majority in this
Btate. There were a number of other
small bets during the evening in tbe Fifth
avonue Hotel. W. R. Hearst watered
$3500 against $6000 that McKinley would
not carry Michigan, Indiana and Illinois.
TRN TO ONE THE ODDS.
Xo Postib!* Chance to Bent McKinley in
Ohio.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. Zâ Chairman
Caien of tbe National Democratic State
Committee and Chairman McConviile of
the Democratic State Committee will give
no estimate of the election result in the
State. Chairman Kurtz ot the Republican
committee lets his statement of Saturday
night, in which be claime i the State for
McKinley by from 65,000 to 100,000, siand.
Leading Republicans here are inclined
to consider this claim to be too high, but
ail think the State is sale. Betting seema
to favor this, as odds are 10 to 1 in Mc-
Kinley's favor on the State. The R pub.i
cans have a much better organization, in
fact it was perfect, and Chairman Kurtz is
inclined to accept the statements of his
local committeemen rather than reports
from casual observers to the effect that
there are big Republican defections to free
silver among the workingmen and farmers.

WILMINGTON, Del., Nov. 2.â Tho po

Democrats in a position to know adroit
that the signs point to a majority for Mc-

COLLEGE BOYS
TOOT THE HORN
Their Procession in Honor
of Major McKinley
and Hobart.
Harvard Men Turn Out With
Torches and Shout for
Sound Money.
FIGHTS AMONG THE STUDENTS
Tofts Lads Roughly Handled Until
Rescued by the Boston
Police.
BOSTON, Mass., Nov. 2.â The college
boys tooted the last horn in the political
campaign to â¢ night and had another
torchiignt procession in honor of McKin
ley and Hobart. Though in poiut of
numbers inferior to the big parade of last
Friday night, the finale was far more ex
citing. There were about 800 men in line,
from the State Agricultural College at
Amherst, a score or more Tuft students
and several representatives of Williams
College in a carriage..
Enthusiasm was not wanting, howeyer,
and the paraders were greeted with cheers
all along the line. There had been a
rumor that the Harvard and Institute of
Technology men were to have a little
sport witn each other during the parade,
but this was prevented by the non-ap
pearance of tne Technology boys.
After tbe line had broken up a Harvard
student pulled a cap from one of the
Tufts students' heads and put it in bis
pocket. This the Tuftsman resented and
in a second the Harvard man struck the
former. A scrimmage ensued in which
many were involved, but the Harvard
men had the advantage owing to their
great numbers. The mounted police on
the opposite side oi the square made a
dash for the belligerents, driving the
crowd pell-mell upon the sidewalks and
into doorways, and by a vigorous use of
their clubs aucceeded in quelling the dis
order.
Meantime another row had started far
ther down the square, near Pleasant street,
and there tbe foot poiicemen made a rush
for tbe trouble, using their sticks right
and left. The encounter was short but
decisive, and the police came off masters
of the situation. No arrests were made
and as far as known no one was seriously
hurt, although many received whacks
from the policemen's clubs.
SCENES OF GREAT JOY.
Z'nusual Spectacle Presented on 'Change
at Nr-tr fork.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 2.â Tho Stock
Exchange presented quite a scene of ex
citement and enthusiasm when the gong
sounded for the closing of the board at 3
o'clock. A large crowd of members were
present and were regaled with songs by
the glee club of the Republican dry-goods
district. The glee club consisted of four
members â two ladies and two gentlemen â
and it is the first time in the history of
the Exchange that ladies have appeared
on the floor of the Exchange.
The club s.ing a number of National airs
and were applauded to the echo. After
each sons the enthusiasm reached a high
pitch and finally the brokers were fairly
beside themselves, waving nats and hand
kerchiefs amid wild shouts for a sound
money victory at the polls to-morrow.
No such scene at tbe Stock Exchange has
been witnessed in any previous Presiden
tial campaign.
CYCLE TEADE DECLINING.
Great falling Off in Business Between
Enqlnnd and America.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 2.â Consul-
General Parker writes the Department of
State from B rmingham, England, that
trade with the United States in cycle ma
terials continues todecline. The steel-tube
trade reached its highest development
during the December quarter, when tubes
to the value of $251,651 were sent to the
United States.
During the June quarter tubes to the
value of $130,253 were shipped, and for the
quarter ended September 30 last, ship
ments were reduced to $67,787.
Many of the contract- made by Ameri
can cycle makers have expired and others
are running out, and Parker is of the opin
ion that trade in these products will prac
tically cease by tbe end of 1897.
No complete Bicycles have been sent to
trie United States for some time. On the
other hand a good many American pro
ducts have been sold in the Birmingham
district It is not safe to predict how long
this demand will continue, but as trade
conditions have improved generally dur
ing ti.e past year it is likely that a consid
erable number of machines of good qual
ity may be sold if offered at prices slightly
lower than those ruling for the same kind
in Birmingham.

AWFUL DEEDS IN
THE PHILIPPINES
Rebels and Spaniards Vie
With Each Other in
Atrocities.
Prisoners' Hands Are Nailed to
Walls and the Thumb-
Screws Used.
A BLACK HOLE OF CALCUTTA.
One Hundred Unfortunates Thrown
Into a Dungeon Not Large
Enough for Thirty.
LONDON, Enq., Nov. 2. -The Daily
News will to-morrow publish a letter from
an English merchant in the Philippine
Islands that was dispatched to London on
September 30. The writer alleges that
horrible atrocities have been perpetrated
by both the rebels and the Spaniards, and
more especially by the latter, who torture
their prisoners, particularly when they
are prominent men, with a view to forc
ing them to confess complicity in the
rebellion. He declares that in some cases
prisoners' hands have been nailed to walls,
while in other cases thumbscrews have
been used. A hundred prisoners were
thrown in one night into a dungeon in the
fortress at Manila, where there was hardly
room for thirty. The place was worse
than tne Black Hole of Calcutta. The
poor wretches were up to their knees in
filthy, putrid mud. Fifty-nine of them
died during the night. A reign of terror
exists in Manila and elsewhere in tbe
islands. Wholesale arreste are made
daily of innocent and guilty persons.
The writer adds that tbe rebellion is
due solely to the rotten and corrupt ad
ministration of the Spaniards, which the
natives were unable to endure any longer.
The outlook is of tbe blackest description
and business is at a complete standstill.
The writer was compelled to leave his
estate, the Government refusing to guar
antee his safety there.
Prisoners are executed by the wholesale.
In treating of this subject the writer de
scribes the shooting of four men on the
public promenade. The troops held their
rifles t>o close to the heads of the con
demned men that when tbe weapons were
discharged their heads were blown to
atoms. Crowds of Spani-h women went
to see these lour rebels executed.
A DOURTFUL INTERVIEW.
t'itzhugh Lee Said to Have Kulogimed

MADRID, Spain, Nov. 2.â The Havana
correspondent of El Liberal cables what
purports to be an interview had by him
with Consul-General Lee prior to the de
parture of the latter yesterday from Ha
vana for New York.
According to the dispatch, General Lee
sai l he was going to rank* a private visit
to New York. He added, tbe correspond
ent says, that he was confident that the
heroism of Captain-General Weyler's
troops would speedily terminate the re
bellion. He also eulogized the spirit
Spain displayed.
LOOKING FOR FILIBUSTERS.
American Brig Held Up at Midnight by
a Spanish Man-of- War.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 2.â Captain
Montgomery of the brig Carib, which ar
rived to-day from Truxillo, reports that on
October 19, about midnight, a war vessel
without lights displayed was sighted.
"Shortly afterward," says the captain,
"the stranger blew his whistle several
times to attract attention and finding that
we did not heed nim tired a gun. The brig
was hove to and waited for twenty min
utes, until within speaking distance. Tbe
stranger proved to be a Spanish man-of
war.
"We were hailed and asked onr vessel's
name and whither bound, as well as if we
had seen any Spanish vessels. After re
ceiving replies they thnnked ns and said
'good-night,' steaming away to the east
ward without showing her lights. The
night was dark and it was impossible to
distinguish her rigging."
Interesting Developments Expected.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 2,- A Herald
special from Jacksonville, Fla., says:
Cuban leaders here and iniLey West de
clare that they have reliable information
that the relations of the United States
and Spain have reached a crisis and that
developments of great interest may be ex
pected within the next month.
CALIFORNIA WHEAT IN INDIA.
Arrival of Thousands of Ton* Will Do
Much to Alleviate Distress.
CALCUTTA, India, Nov. 2.â The ar
rival of thousands of tons of California
wheat ai this port has had the effect of
causing a reduction in prices in some
parts of tbe districts affected by tne
famine.
It is believed that a total of 30,000 tons
of wheat has been purchased for importa
tion into India. The Government is doing
everything possible to alleviate the dis
tress.
It has employed 53,800 persons on works
which have been started in order to fur
nish work for those wlio, wimout it, would
probably starv to death. The effects of
the failure of the crops are not felt as seri
ously now as they will be later. The
worst distress will be in the middle of
December.
CASE OF THE CASTLES.
Hearing Set for Friday Next at the
Clerkenweil Sessions â Reticence of
Counsel for the Defense.
LONDON, Eno., Nov. 2.â The Clerken
well sessions opened to-day. The hearing
of tho case of the Castles was set down for
Friday, November 6.
Chairman McConnell of the Clerken
weil sessions delivered the charge to the
Grand Jury upon the ordinary course of
cases to be heard, calling special atten
tion to tbe case of Mr. and Mrs. Castle, in
which be said that the facts did not differ
from those constituting a case of ordinary
larceny except in respect to the position
of tbe parties accused. Their case, he
thought, was a proper one for inquiry by
a common jury.
Mr. and Mrs. Castle did not appear.
Sir Edward Clarke, Sir Frank Lockwood
and Mr. Abrahams, counsel for defense,
met at tbe chambers of Sir Edward Clarke
to discuss the course to be taken by the
defense. It is understood that the chief
point under discussion was whether Mr?.
Castle should plead guilty with tne ex
tenuating plea of mental weakness, but
counsel declined to disclose the nature of
their decision in tne matter.

McKinley Men Offer Even
Money, With Few
Takers.
Bryanites Unwilling to Risk
Cash in Support of Their
Claims.
REPUBLICAN SUCCESS CERTAIS
A Remarkable Change in Favor of
Sound Money in the
Sou!h.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 2.â One of
â  tbe most remarkable campaigns ever
known in Southern California closed here
to-ni.ht. Combinations and fusions of
every sort have been entered Jhto, while
party lines have been broken in a manner
never before equaled in the history of
politics in this country. Owing to this
condition everybody is considerably at
sea as to the result of to-morrow's vote.
Predictions and estimates of the parties
are as wide apart as the oceans. The
Bryanites claim the county by 1000
majority, but, with nothing tangible upon
which to base their prognostications, the
Republicans claim the county by from
2000 to 4000.
At betting headquarters here a remark
kble change has been observed in the past
two or three days in favor of s-ound money.
The principal betting is on the State and
county. Even money is offered by Mc-
Kinley men that the county will Â«jo Re
publican, but there are few takers. An
offer which is attracting considerable at-
tention is one of even money that MiKitT'
ley will receive forty more electoral votes
than Bryan. The Bryan backers are
somewhat shaky, and if they have any
opinion tney are not anxious to back it up
â with" coin.' On general results 2)^ to 1 on
McKiuley is ireely offered witn but few
takers.
A bet of $25 to $35 was placed to-day
â  that McKinley would receive fifty more
electoral votes than Br}'an. McKinley
money was freely offered on Illinois, In
diana and lowa with no takers.

SANTA KOSA, Cal., Nov. 2.â The last
Republican meeting of tbe campaign was
held to-night and wound up in a bluze of

lican County Central Committee, called

received an ovation.
When the applause hid subsided Con
gressman Barhara began his address,
which waa one of the best heard during
the campaign. His views on the Nicar
agua canal were direct to ti e point, and
he assured the audience that he would
use every effort to have the canal opened
and controlled by the United States Gov
ernment. Mr. Barham spoke an hour and
â¢was closely followed and lrequently
cheered durine his address.
The local candidates spoke briefly after

given with a will. M. T. Noyes, a pro mi
sent San Joaquin County farmer, was
chairman of the meeting, and paid his re
epects to what he termed the two hum
. bugsâ free silver and free trade.

and he offered one of the most logical and
. convincing arguments of the campaign.

added to the enthusiasm of the big audi
ence. Judge J. G. Swinnerton closed with
one of his old-time speeches, full of logic
and delightful to listen to.

astic meetings ever held in this city.

PORTLAND NITUATION.
Indications That McKinUy Hill Carry
the State.
PORTLAND, Ob., Nov. 2.â lncoming
trains and steamers to-day brought home
many leading campaigners, and at the
respective hcudquarters encouraging re
ports were given out. Outside of Port
laud and Multnomah County, which are
overwhelmingly Republican, the question
ot which way the State will go to-morrow
is much in doubt.
Bettin,- is lively and much McKinley
mo.:ey was placed to-day at 3 to 1. A
rumor waa started ibis atternoon that
there was money waiting for takers that
Bryan would have some kind of majority
in Oregon, but the cash was withdrawn.
There is every indication that a large
vote will be polled to-morrow in this State.
Tbe campaign has been the most exciting
ever experienced in the Northwest, and
all forces are active and determined.
The weather forecast tor to-morrow is
occasional rain, warmer in eastern part of
State and some sunshine. It is thought
the storm which has been raging on the
coast will abate to-night and that it will
not interfere with the vote. Tne Repub
licans say to-night that Coos and Clack
amas counties, not thickly populated but
overwhelmingly Populistic, will go for
McKinley.
The city has received within a week an
alien population of several hundred, in
cluding thugs< and crooks, who are being
housed in the north end, and make no de
nial of thtir object in suddenly flocking
bere. A large force of deputy sheriffs
and extra policemen was sworn in to-day
and m-tructed how to preserve order
to-morrow to prevent a repetition of
the bloody scenes at the primaries last
April and June, when the "Bloody
Ninth" achieved unsavory notoriety.
Trouble is feared and the police will have
their bands lull preserving order. All
business is to be suspended and offices
closed. As no Congressmen are to be
voted for here to-morrow, the ballot is
simple and the result in Oregon should
be known early, although from interior
counties 80 and 100 miles from railroad or
telegraph reports of the vote will be slow
coming in.
OUTLOOK I N WASHINGTON.
Republican Leader* Claim Certain Vie-
Tory for Their Hotel.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 2â ln the clos
ing hours of the campaign in this State
the Republicans are fighting more gal
lantly, if possible, than at any time since
the battle beeur., while the leadersâ nota"^
b!y Governor McGraw and Andrew F.
Burleigh â insist that Washington is to en
roll herself in the McKinley column.
Potter Charles Sullivan, a* well as Doo
little and Hyde, Republican Congres
sional candidates, will be elected. Sur
face indications, viewed impartially, seem
ingly point to Bryan's victory in the State.
Also that free-silver Congressional candi
dates Lewis and Jones will win, with tbe
vote ou tbe governorship being very close.
lnthelasthourst.be combined free sil
ver forces, styling themselves the people's
party, have not put forth us much effort
as the Republicans and they were out
numbered by latter in the joint parade
Saturday night at Tacoma.
This evening, in this city. Republicans
and gold standard Democrats iield big
meetings in tbe armory and Seattle
theater, tbe principal addresses being de
livered by Andrew F. Burleijib, Governor
McGraw and Major W. V. Reinhart.
Free silver advocates charge fraud at
bands of Republicans in matter of regis
tration. They claim that 6J3 or 700 alleged
voters who registered from the water front
precinct cannot be foun I. and assert that
these people in reality reside in localities
not witbin tne city limits, and that their
purpose is to repeat.
An Everett special says A. D. Warner,
formerly of this city and one of the most
prominent lawyers in the Sate, was ar
rested mere this afternoon at tbe instance
of tbe Republicans lor false registration.
Warner, who has been stumping tbe State
for Bryan and free silver, is the author of
a book entitled "People vs. Gold Bug in

Lincoln, Nebr., Oct. 28.
Dear Cousin Frank: Yes, the e.ectiou is red
hot here, but not all for w. J. Bryan. 1 am a
Democrat, but can't follow Mr. Bryan In his
silver craze, and there are other partÃ of the
Chicago p.atform that are not Democratic. If
tkey are, I have been mistaken all my lite,
and we have lots of Democrats here that think
tbe same way.
Mr. Bryan is one of our nearest neighborsâ
half a block away. He will lose his predict
ward and the cityâ the city by at least 1000!
The Republicans claim tbe county by from
2000 to 2500. I don't think there is any
doubt but he will be beaten in tbe county by
1500. Tbe State Is going to be very close. It
now looks as it Bryan would lose the State.
He has been rapidly losing ground for the last
tv in y days.
I shou.d hope California would cast a de
cisive ballot for honest money, not for a
depreciated dollar. It is a battle royal in
Nebraska, and I hope and believe it will be
carried for sound money and not tound in the
repudiation column after the polls ou Novem
ber 3. r. Â£. Johnson.
IN SACRAMENTO COUNCIL.
McKinley and Congreaatuan John ton
Mill Be Given Large M ijoritir*.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 2.â The
street-corner Republican meetings held
all over the city to-night under the
auspices of the Business Men's Sound
Money League of Sacramento drew im
mense crowds, which were all wildly en
thusiastic. At the corner of Seventh and
X streets, where Congressman Grove L.
Johnson addressed the gathering, thu
streets were impassable.
All along the principal streets the
throngs cheered for McKinley and John
son, and it appears as though the latter
would receive at least 4000 majority in
this county alone. Over 600 Republican
badges were issued this morning by the
Business Men's League and tbe supply
fell short at least 600 J. Sacramento County
will roll up a lar-e majority for McKinley
to-morrow.
Oratory tit Santa Barbara.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Nov. 2.â The
campaign closed here to-night with one
of the largest and most enthusiastic gath
erings that ever assembled in tbe opera
bouse. The meeting was presided over by
ex-Mayor Barber, who in a neat speech
introduced Judge J. J. Boyce. The judge
wasted no time in preliminaries, but
waded througti tbe labyrinth of free silver
arguments, showing the results that would
fo.low free coinage without the co-opera
tion of other nations. His appeal for
sound money and protection was tbe most
maaterly of the campaign. The Judsre
was followed by the Hon. Sepunea Katiei
from Los Angeles, who spoke in Spauisb
an i captivated tbose who understood the
Spanish tongue by his eloquence, predict
ing a sweeping victory to-morrow.

EUR EKA DEMONSTRATIONS.
Jtepublieana and lietnocrata Parade and
I.iitrn to Oratory.
EUREKA, Cal., Nov. 2.â The greatest
and most exciting political demonstration
ever witnessed in Humooldt County
marked tbe close of the campaign in Eu
reka to-night.
Both siiverites and Republicans held
rallies, preceded by parades, and there
was presented tbe odd scene of long lines
of torch-bearing adherents of tbe opposing
factions marching along the principal
streets at the same time and frequently
passing each other on tbe same street, the
one shouting for Bryan and Cutler, the
other for McKinley and Barnam, all good
naturedly chaffing each other, but withal
maintaining the best of order and good
feeling.
The Republican line, which included
the McKinley Drill Corps, 200 strong, all
uniformed and wearin golden chrysan
themums in their caps, outnumbered by
two to on the silverites, whosa principal
organization wes the "Wharl Rats Union,"
composed largely of longshoremen.
Tne Republican mee:ii)g was at Cen
tennial Hall while the silverites rallied at
the Fair Pavilion, the attendancs about
equalâ lsoo at each.
Frank W. Cushman of Washington,
Hon. Frank McGowan and Ernest Sevier,
of Eureka, tbe latter a recent convert
from the Democracy, addressed the Repub
licans, while F. A. Cutler ot Eureka, fu
sion nominee for Congress, spoke to his
party. The silverites' meeting was purely
a Cutler meeting, but while there was as
many Republicans as siiveritea in the pa
vilion tne meeting at Centennial Hall was
almost wholly composed of Republicans.
Conservative estimates for to-morrow give
tbe county to McKinley by about 300.

SEATTLE SALVAGE
CLAIMS AWARDED
Forty Thousand Dollars the
Cost of Saving the
Strathnevis.
The Owners and Crews of the
Miowera and Mineola
Remunerated.
JUDGE HAKFORD'3 DECISION.
Rules That Both Vessels Aided in
Rescuing the Foundered
Steamship.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 2.â Judge Han
ford of the Federal court held a Â«pecial
session this evening and decided the fa
mous Strathnevis case, which a few
months ago was the talk of steamship
men not only in the United States but in
the Orient and in Europe. In his decision
Jud^e Han ford awards salvage claims
asrainst the Stratbnevis, which is a North
ern Pacihc ship, amounting to upward of
$40,100.
The Strathnevis left the port of Tacoma
on October 12, 1893, for the Orient. It
touched at Victoria, took on a passenger
or two and some freight, and then started
on its long purnev. On the seventh day
out its propeller shaft broke and the ves
sel found itself so thoroughly disabled
that it was unable to proceed. Then
came on heavy storm* and the Strath
nevis was in a bad way, and the news went
out that it was lost. After being out
til ty-nine days the Canadian Pacific steam
ship Miowera, running from Vancouver
to Australia, encountered the Sirathnevis.
At the time the Strathnevis was flying
signals of distress. The Miowera sent a
man aboard and it was agreed that the
Miowera should tow the disabled ship
back to Puget Sound.
But difficulty was encountered. Several
times the hawser broke and as many
times It was repaired, and the Miowera
worked many days to get the Strathnevis
back to the sound. On December 20 the
Strathnevis and Miowera wore about forty
miles from Cape Flattery. Again the
hawser broke, and on December 23, while
the Strathnevis and Miowera were sixty
three mile* from Cape Flattery, navinu'
been unable for several aays to make any
progress, the two ships got separated.
The M.owera searched for some hours for
the disabled ship, but was unable to find
it. Finally it proceeded on its journey to
Australia.
About the same time the Mineola,
owned by the P.icih'c Improvement Com
pany, and f.n route to San Francisco from
Tacoma, encountered the Strathnevis. It
was ilyine signals of distress and the
Mineola went to its rescue and succeeded
in getting the vessel back to Punet Sound.
The Miowera and M.neola both hied
libels for salvage and the case was argued
some weeks ago. J dee Hanford gives
the Mineola's owner $12,000, its captain
$1800 and the individual m>mbers of the
crew sums ran-'iriK from $600 tv $100 and
amounting in all to abou $1.00. He gives
the Miowera's owners $18 000 and the
member-' of the crew about $700. in sums
of from $500 to $50. "i'he court holds that
the two shin* winch went to the rescue of
the Sirathnevis were responsible for its
being saved, and says that although the
Miowera was compelled to desert the
Sirathnevis in the eu<l, it nevertheless
towed the vessel out of immediate danger
and placed it where it was saved by
another Bhip.

STANFORD'S FRESHMAN TEAM.
Pah A/to FootbaH-P/ayers Will Give Berke
ley's 00' s a Hard Contest
Saturday.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
2. â The freshman team is practicing now
for its game on Saturday with the Berke
ley freshmen. Next to the intercollegiate
game on Thanksgiving this is regarded
as the most important football match
of the season by collegians. The fresh
man eames were inaugurated two years
agj, and in both former matches Berkeley
has won. Wi. ether it can do it again this
year remains to be seen.
The team here has done little or no prac
tice as a team and was defeated some
weeks ago by the Belmont School eleven.
At that time, however, the Jine was even
lighter than it is now and several of the
players were laid off. With proper train
ing a very fair team should be collected
from the material. During the few days
remaining Captain Murphy intends to
have his eleven work hard, and he be
lieves they will at least give the Berkeley
players a hard fight for victory. The line
is still weak, and Diggles, who is good
either for a "star" end or half, has not re
covered the use of his ankle sufficiently to
enable bim to play.
The men who are showing up most fa
vorably in practice are Murphy, Rusk.
McGiivray, Burnett and Madden. Mad
den and McGiivray are the ends, and if the
latter plays the game be is able to play he
should be not only a good ground-gainer,
but a bard man for the opposition to en
circle. Rusk is a good tackle, and Burnett
may also play tbat position, though center
or guard is his regular place. Murphy is
a promising candidate for quarterback of
the Varsity, and should certainly give a
good account of himself in the freshman
match. Scoville is another freshman who
has shown remarkable aptitude fo,- the
game, but he is rather light for the posi
tion of halfback, which he will probably
be calltd upon to till.

CAHTO, Cal., Nov. 2.â The half cre
mated body of Joun Mudgett, a wealthy
rancher of Usal, was found to-day in the
embers of his half-burned home at that
place by W. H. Davis, a neighbor. Mud
gett lived alone on an immense tract of
laud. He was a reputed hoarder of weal th
and it was rumored that he had money
stored about the house. His body bore
unmistakable evidence of death by vio
lence before the flames r ached him. Both
lower limbs are missing.
The house had been fired and the con
flagration, after burning for a time,
had been extinguished by lack of a
draught. Kerosene oil had been used to
start the fire, aÂ£ two cans hurriedly picked
oj>en with a hatchet were among the par

Tnat Mudgett met foul play seems an
assured fact since the discovery that all of
his winter supplies are gone. It is wel
known tbat he recently received a large
consignment of flour and other provisions
necessary to tide him over the winter
months. Persons suspected of the crime
are under surveillance. The Sheriff and
Coroner are expected to arrive on the
scene at daylight.
The deceased was unmarried, 46 years oi
age, a native of Belfast, Me., and had a
cousin of the same name in iCortuna,

SEEING THE FUTURE.-
A so-called magician in London has been
coining money lately by showing people
pictures of their future. life. One strong
man saw himseif 'depicted as : an aced,
worn-out wreck of humanity, broken down
with care. A woman in robust health saw
herself transformed into a gloomy invalid.
t There was a trick about it, of course, but
every visitor went away feeling heavy
hearted bnd despondent. .
There are thousands of men and women
to-day who would be filled with similar
terror if they could only see the future in
store for them unless they do something
at once to prevent it. Tney are nervous
we ik, tired, languid, exhausted in nerve
power and physical strength. They are
sleepless and awaken tired ami unre
freshed, without energy lor the day's
work. . ;
When people get to feeling like this it
plainly shows that their systems are badly
run down. â¢ These symptoms are the sure
signs oi malaria, of debility, and the best
way to get rid of tnem is to take a pure
medicinal stimulant which will I build up
the strength. The best stimulant is pure
whiskey, but ,it must be absolutely pure
and there is only one whiskeyâ Duffy's
pure maltâ which fully answers this de
scription. This whi key drives out ma
laria and builds up the whole system. It
makes ; weak, weary people strong and
well. All grocers and druggists keep
Duffy's pure malt whiskey. Tjere is no
other whiskey like Duffy's, and nothing

Ten Thousand People
Heard Him Speak in
the Pavilion.
TW AS A GREAT EFFORT IN
A GREAT CAUSE
A Strong Appeal to Common-
Sense and Business Methods
in Government.
THE CREDIT OF THE NATIO:
SHOULD BE PRESERVED.
Wage-Earners and Farmers Will Be the Most In
juriously Affected Should the Free
Coinage Issue Win.
Oakland extended a hearty greeting to
Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine yester
day.
He spoke to ten thousand people on and
around the grand stand at the new race
track â one of the most enthusiastic as
semblages he had met in this State, and
his speech was one of the best he has
made since he arrived here.
Special trains were run from the Oak
land pier to accommodate the crowds
from Oakland and this City, the regular
trains being altogether inadequate for
that purpose. In addition the streetcar
lines from Oakland were running to their
full capacity, while the resources of the
livery stables in the way of horses, buggies,
phaetons and carriages were taxed to the
utmost.
The grand stand was crowded and the
space beneath, also all the ground on
ooth sides of the speakers' stand erected
for that purpose.
Among the invited guests on the speak
ers'stand were ex-Congressman Hilborn,
United States Senator Perkins, Professor
Keilog,- of the University at Berkeley, to
gether with several of Oakland's leading
Republican politicians.
Up in the grand stand a group of Berke
ley students enlivened the pauses between
the 'music with college yells and songs lor
McKinley. On the opposite part of the
same structure a knot of Oakland High
â¢ School students opposed the noisy Berke
leyans with their war cry, and made the
welkin ring for the Republican standard
bearers.
F-. T. Fletter introduced W. H. Chick
ering of Oakland as chairman of the meet
ing, who proposed three cheers for Mr.
Reed, and they were given three times
three, the audience rising in their seats
and waving handkerchiefs and golden
chrysanthemums with enthusiasm.
When Mr. Reed stood up to speak the
audience cheered and cheered, so loudly
and so long that it was nearly a minute
before order was restored sufficiently to
enable him to be beard. He spoke as fol
lows:
I thank you very much tor your kindly
greeting. I could hardly fail to feel at home
in California, tor I was here when California
was very young, and this audience reminds
me very much of it [laughterj, because when
I was here In the earlier day this magnificent
Oakland, so splendidly represented by this
great hudience, was only a town of scrub oaks
and possibilities. The oaks were smTll, but
the possibilities evidently were large. [Laugh
ter and applause]
1 find myself also surrounded on all hands
by Maine menâ a Senator from California
from my district, a member of Congresh from
my district who studied law in the same town
that I did wiien we were both very much
younger. [Laughter and cheers.]
About the Senator it would not be proper
for me to speak, and he does not need it Tne
member also does not need it, but I am going
to gratify mysef by saying that 1 hope my old
friend will be returned to Congress by such a
majority as will show your appreciation of
his worth. [Applause.]
1 have come to discuss with you the ques
tions of the day, to lay before you certain
propositions which I believe in and certain
opinions which I entertain. Of course, they
will amount to nothing unless they pass the
test of your good sense.
Irr order to make this world progress in a
reasonable and sensible way God has created
men of two classes. One class Is that of pio
neers and inventors â a progressive people
The other class is the conservative multitude'
â¢ which, fortunately for us sometimes in our
â¢ history, is the class that is most numerous.
Men very often bring to us, especially in po
litical life, theories which they want us to
test. It costs something to test a theory
and therefore all theories have to be submit
ted to the intelligence of the people of the
country. â¢
It sometimes happens that a theory which is
presented with a great deal of noise goes out
of existence with a great deal of fiience.
[Laughter and applause.]
The proposing class is a very excellent class
and deserves all the credit and praise it gets;
nevertheless, there are a great many ol them
whose hands are very far ahead ol their brains
[luugbter] and who have to be examined very
carefully as to the prepositions they bring for
ward. [Applause.]
-Now, we had a few years ago a lot of gentle
men who thought they were full of ideas.
[Laughter.] It turned out they were full of
mistakes. TGreat applause and cries of "That's
right, Tom. '] We were in very fair condition
lour years ago; there was a chance for an hon
est man to get a day's work most anywhere in
the whole expanse of this country, and espe
cially in the State of California. [Applause]
Capital was at work, mills were open and
labor had its day. They were struggling not
for Jobs but for higher wages. Some gentle
men saw this condition of affairs and declared
that if we would on y put them in office we
would be better off. Well, we were us foolish
as the Spanish grandee on whose tomb was
this inscription : "I was well. I wanted to be
better. I took medicine, and here I am."
[Uproarious applause and laughter, mingled
with shouts of "What's the matter with Reed ?
He's all right."] You, feJlow-citizens, have
had that medicine, and where are you? [Cries
. of "Dead" and "In the soup."]
These gentlemen were mostly silver-tongued
orators. [Laughter.] They proclaimed to the
world that they were able to make descend
i upon earth the heavenly Jerusalem, provided
/â they, could take charge of it when it de-
M ecended. [Uproarious laughter and applause.]
\1 They said that we were a nation of consumers
Vid that what we wanted was to buy things
â  1 a iow price. They said that if we could
have tilings cheap we could be happy. They i
looked upon us simply as consumers, f Ap- j
piause.]
As I told them at the time If their theories
were correct all the American and his wife did
was to sit in a rocking-chair, teeter backward
and forward and consume things. [Laughter.]
These gentlemen made arrangements that all
the productions should be somewhere else.
They took a great deal of pains with that.
[Applause.] r
They gave our woolen indus ries over to
Great Britain; they undertook to give our
fruit industries to the sunny lands of France;
they tried their best to give our steel indus
tries to France, Germany and Great Britain.
[Applause.] Fortunately they were not able
to do as well as they tried to" do. [Laughter.]
In the House of Representatives under Mr.
Bryan's theoriesâ for he was not a leader there
â[Applause]. toward the middle of the assem
bly all this was attempted, but when they got
up. to the Senate of the United States that body
certainly did curb them. Yet they let our
woolen industries go to the bad. ]Applause.]
We told those men that they were mistaken.
They did not believe it. We have succeeded by
the events of the last four years in convincing
even them. [Applause and shouts of "That's
what."]
Mr. Bryan has had enough of us, however,
and the tariff, apparently. [Laughter.] If he
has not had enough the Slate of California
certainly has. [Great applause.] Remember
that In this world the Lord teaches people in
different ways, sometimes by the mouth of his
prophet, sometimes even by the mouth of
stump speakers. [Laughter and applause.]
But the greatest lesson that he can give our
people or other people â if other planets are
Inhabitedâ the lesson of experience, but
whenever you go to the school of experience
you pay very high wages to the teacher.
[Applause.] â  , .. â¢â 
for the last four or five years have been
paying the wages of experience. , You have
been suffering by those men who in 1892 gave
you advice. [Applause and shouts of "Thai's
true."] What are those men doing now ? Four
years have elapsed, four years of misfortune
and unhappiness. and what are those men
doing ? Are they down on their, knees with
their hands over their, mouths and their
mouths in the dust, saying. "We have misled
the people ?" [Cries oi "Nit !"] Not a bit of
it. They are standing on the hilltops, with
their mouths wide open, and larger mouths
than they had four years ago. [Uproarious ap
plause, mingled with laughter and shouts.]
For pure, unadulterated impudence there is
nothing like the attitude oi these patriots.
[Laughter.]. Deserted by all honest men In
the Democratic party, they stand up and have
the audaci.y to promise you that if you will
only follow them again they will lead you not
where they led you before, not into the slough
of despond, but to the gates of gold. A set of
men may be deceived once, but if they are de
ceived a second time it is nobody's fault but
their own. [Uproarious applause.] i
I tell you that the laws of nature will not be
suspended on your account. Three months
ago every man of them admitted defeat. They
were right; defeat was staring them in the
face. [Applause.] It still stares them in the
face, and to-morrow it will do more. â¢ [Great
applause.]
1 say that theÂ«e men come before you again,
and what is their proposition? Is it the mar
kets of the world? That is what they were go
ing to give us four years ago, the markets of
the world. [Applause .. and laughter.] They
deprived us of the most. magnificent market
there is on earth. [Applause.] What is that?
It IS the market where men have the most
money to spend. Where is that? In the United
States oi America. . [Great and long-continued
applause.] . <
And In return they send us hunting fof the
markets of China and Senegamb ia and Mexico
and Central Africa. [Great applause.] How do
you like that? [Yells of disapprobation and
disgust.] . lv*M>SÂ§ a *iMHHÃl
Now they, say what we want in order to be !
happy is the free coinage of silver â 16 to 1 â
by the great,' big . United States that can
drive silver up or : water down or any- I
thing. [Great . laughter and applause. [ I
There was a day r when the United States
felt it necessary to boast. That was the
time when the United : States was in doubt
about itself. [Laughter.] Boasting by the
United States is like the whistling of the man
who goes through a graveyard â he don't do It
because he is merry, but because he is scared.
[Tremendous laughter and applause, followed
by yells of approval.) , j â 
This Nation doesn't need any boasting. It
is big enough to stand up by itself. [Applause. [
When the United States is trumpeting it wants '
some brains behind the trumpet. [Laughter.] j
Now, the United States is big, but it cannot
change the Arabic figures. [Laughter.] That j
Is what they want us to do. They want us to
change 31 to Itol6to 1. [Applause.] This is
not bimetallism. -
_ The free coinage of silver by the United
States, 16 to 1, means a 50-cent dollar; and If
you do not believe it I think. I can prove it.
[Applause.] What the whole world could do
with free niiver I do not; know; what the
United States-can do with it I do know [ap
plause], because the United States has tried it.
[Applause.] â¢
Mr. Bryan SRys: "We believe that if we
were to coin silver 16 to 1 that the silver
would- go up and be tqnal with gold." What
proof does he give of it? [Shouts of "None 1"]
Not the slightest. He say- "We believe." Who
made him a council o: the church that his
belief should be substituted for facts? [Great
laughter and applause.] -â¢â¢,.; â  l .â¢...-

know we have 600,000,000 of Silver collars in
circulation now ? That is so far as people will
take them. .[Laughter.] Six hundred mi lions
but we never coined but 8.000,000 of those
alter Â« ratio ; was established. Eignt million
dollars were taken out of circulation for the
very simple reason that every one of those
dollars was worth 103 cents. No man is fool
enough to pay anybody 103 cents when he
can pay him 100. [Applause.] â¢ c " v "
. You would think trom what these men said
that we had , been murdering silver some
where. Now, what is, the effect of buvini?
$600,000,000 -of silver?. ; Has .it gone up?
Mr. Bryan said it would, and his explanation
of it telegraphed - â here some words were
Inaudible on account of the noisy dtmonstra
trations of the crowd âin which: he says
the law of supply and demand will 'cover it
and in that letter he shows exactly what his'
followers are. They are men who know half a
thing and never know a whole thing. [Ap
plause.] *He says : the i law of supply and de
mand. Don't you believe that? I; do. He 1
says if there is more of a demand for a thing
don't the price go up ? Yes; that is the specu
lator's law of supply and demand. ~;'.. ->'
; But, thank heaven, there is another law of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
supply and demand for the people of this
earth, which is tnat when there is an increase
of the demand there will always be an increase
of tue supply, and that at a lower price. That
is God's law for the benefit of the average
human being. [Great applause.[ The law of
supply and demand that these men know is
the speculator's law. [Cheers.]
I: the supply of silver increases on account
oi the demand, then silver goes down. That
is a law that applies to silver as well aa to fur
niture and men and everything else. [Ap
plause ] The bigger the demand the bigger
the supply and the lower the price.
Take steel rails, a cask of wire nails â take
anything that you can for which there is a de
mandâand wherever the supply can be fur
nished then the price goes down" Now, let me
illustrate that with silver; nothing less will
do. We bought in 1878 two million dollars'
worth. We kept it up till 1890. There is de
mand for you. [Laughter.] Why every four
months we bought and coined more sliver
than we had coined for a century of our ex
istence. What is the effect? Did silver go up?
According to Mr. Bryan's demand of course
it did. [Laughter.] Why, you know that it
went down from 7 per cent discount to 50 per
cent discount If this man wouid take the
trouble to learn &U the truth how much
trouble it would *aye us! [Great cheering.]
What is money? Now, I am going to tell
you, for the benefit of a professor, what money
is. [Laughter] Money is the instrument of
exchange. It may be standard of deferred
payments also, but so far as business is con
cerned it is the medium of exchange; and I
am going to put a -proposition to you which 1
put to some of the farmers in this State.where,
unlike some of the papers of the State, they
know the difference between a hayrack and a
hayrake. [Great laughter.]
If I have a barn worth $5000 and a man
gives me $5000 in gold, I have in my hand the
potentiality of $5000 worth of anything, no
matter what it v, that is purchasable with
money. [Applause.]
Why, I hire a professor with money [laugh
ter] only I might waste the money in some
cases. [Great laughter and applause]. I conld
hire a uewspaperâ i do not mean on mis coast.
[Uproarious laughter and yells of "Yes, you
could."]
In short, as Carlyle says, "If I have sixpence
the whole world is my slave to the extent of
sixpence, but the sole purpose of the sixpence
is to convey something to me irom somebody
else when I have made my choice." What is a
hayrake? For the benefit of certain persons I.
will state. It is a vehicle for tne conveyance
of hay from one point to another. Now, when
ever anybody has a crop of hay, thus far in the
history of the world there have always been
found havrakes to move it, the ntcessary num
ber in relation to the crop. Will any man say
that if you double the number of havrakes you
will double the hay crop? Yet those men say
that if you double the transfer in money you
will double the business of the world.
The business oi the country can always take
care of itself, and there is always money to be
had whenever we waut it, and when we don't
want it it is loolish to have it. What is the
use to a man who can't drive out of doors to
have horses in his stable ? He would better
give the livery stable a chance.
In 1879 we resumed specie payments, and an
our business went on we added $196,000,000
of gold from the world's stock because we
wanted it. And whenever we don't want it It
goes home somewhere eise. Whenever we do
want it it comes here. We always want it
when the Republican party is in power, and it
always goes to Europe when the other fellow's
in power.
Don't you trouble yourself about money.
Money will always be where people want it,
and it won't ko where people scare it out of the
country. In addition to tnat, instead of $5000
in gold I may have taken something else; 1
may have taken your note if I believed in you.
I may have taken the banker's note if I be
lieved in him. There are thousands of things
which operate as money. The whole capital
of the country is doing a brisk business, and
when it is not doing a brisk business youcau't
use checks or any oiher kind ot money. Even
gold and silver are hoarded, and to-day the
money of this country is worth a high rate of
interest, notwithstanding that $50,000,000 iv
gold has come here within the last three
mouths, because those who have got that gold
i are gcing to keep it until they find out that if
â¢ they lend it they will get it all back.
The S ate of California is the most magnifi
cent State in resources that there is in the
United States and 1 am as willing to siiy that
on the Atlantic Coast as in the presence ot this
Califorulan audience. It is because I believe
in the resources of California and because I
believe In the sensible opinion of the Cali
fornia people. What you need and have ai
ways needed has been wealth to deve.op your
resource^. The people of New Eiulani, when
they first Came to America, applied themselves
to the hoe and the rake, but CaUfornia's riches
depend upon riches brought here, applied to
the soil, and to your splendid mines of all
kinds that you will discover as soon as you get
capital enough here to work them. It is a fact
that the majority of the whole United States'
capital is needed to develop it, and you have
to have ail the spare capital of thu United
States and of the world.
That being the case how loolish you are to
drive American capital into hoarding places
and to keep foreign capital beyond the Atlan
tic. Are you doing it? Let me Dring you down
to the test of common-sense. Any man in this
crowd who has got $100, it there is such a man
here, I want to a?k him a simple question.
If I come to you and say 1 want to borrow
the $100, and, being an honest man, I say to
you frankly that I am going to try my best to
pay you only $50 Tnat is what these re
formers are asking you to do. If you won't do
it, do you suppose that the man with $1000 is
100 l enough to do it? If ne was, he must have
inherited that $1000 and never earned it Him
self.
Do you suppose that foreigners doD't know
as much as you do? If you do, you do them an
inju*t.ce. They may not be ab.e to invent a
monetary system, but they know enough to
keep money at home when they want it. But
if you say, "I will pay you $100 for that $100 "
then they will lend it to you. Then Calnornia
will blossom from one end to the other like
the rose, but not at once.
This is too big a country even for the wealth
of the whole universe to-day, but as you go on
and develop your own wealth and' increase
your own power you will again take dollars
out of the bowels of the earth and continue
your march forward to glory and greatness.
Gentlemen, it is worth while to premise
what I am going to say further, by the force
of an honest acknowledgment.
The Democrats, the upper part of them, the
part which was the head a while ago before
the party became headlessâ the uprer portion
of the Democratic partyâ are behaving with
great good sense a.id remarkable patriotism
Men who give advice to other men to leave
their party and rise above party have seldom
realized how difficult it is for men to do that
It is very easy for me to have another man
rise above his party, but it is very hard for
that, man himself. Nevertheless, 21 000
Democrats In the State of Maine rose above
their party, and a large part of them
rose so high that they voted the Republican
ticket and helped give us more than 50,000
majority; which, in my Judgment, was an In
dication of the sound sense of the whole
American people. 1 want also to make an
other suggestion, and that is that, there is a
vast difference between Democrats and Democ
racy and it's a blessed difference, too. Demo
crats sometimes rise above their party
Democracy never. '
I don't care to speak in praise of the Repub
lican party; fortunately it needs no praise
but I do want to call your attention to a re
markable condition of history. The Republi
can party was in control in the United States
for thirty-two years, if I count the first four
years oi Mr. Cleveland's administration as
Republican, because ho was unabie to do any
thing Democratic during that period. During
that time the machinery ran by virtue of the
force which had been put into the engine
years previous. During those thirty-two years
we haa a great deal to contend with. We had
the years that followed 1873, nevertheless we
did some splendid things.
The very first thing that met us was whether
we should pay the bonds of this country in
the very terms in which they were written
and it was a terrible temptation to our peonle
We were $3,000,000,000 in debt, and most of
tiie men who owned the bonds had paid only
half|price for them; yet the question was
shall wo pay the whole price? The ouiv thing
was the argument that those men paid out
only 50 cents on the dollar, and the reply was
that when they did it everybody else had the
same chance and noboly else took it. But the
chance turned out to be a good one, although
there were times when it looked as though it
was going to be a bad one. and therefore hav
ing promised we declnred that we should pay
them in full. The Democratic party fought
thio idea, but the people of the United States
stood up to it. Now, is there a Democrat here
wlio is not proud of the fact that we stood by
the bonds?
That act made the credit of the United States
good all over the world. Then the world real
ized what a magnificent Nation this was. We
could not only conquer the great rebellion but
we could also pay the bills for it without a
murmur, without treachery and without re
pudiation.
Ihen we were poor and exhausted. To-day
notwithstanding four years of the rule of those
mistaken men, we are richer than we ever
werp, except during the time when this thing
commenced. It has been the history of this
country that there have been popular strug
gles to induce the people to be dishones', but
every such struggle hat endea in tne defeat of
dishonest men and repudiators and it will
always be so.
No farmer can afford to pay off his debts at
half price, because the very fact that he tepu
diates, the very fact that there is a gioom over
business renders his paying the other half im
possible.
Buppose we come down to the 50-cent dollar
What will be the effect on business? Mr.
Bryan has been forced to answer those charges!
Lite insurance men have pointed out that
every dollar they have to p*y the beneficiaries
oi lite Insurance every dollar is loaned, money
which on the 50-cent basis will be scaled down
one half, and what answer does Mr. Bryan
gtvt? I want every man of you to hunt up the
paper and read his answer and see how little
he knows of the business of his country that he
is endeavoring to cripple. When he is told
about the savings banks and the fact that they
will pay only half price he says that those men
wno have deposits in the savings bants have
real estate and other property somewhere
else and that the thing will average up.
What about you fellows who have deposits
in the savings banks and have not got any
thing else? I need not only the voice, but the
time, the energy and the feeling to tell you of
the ruin and disaster that would fall upon
business if any such doctrine as that should
prevail. Ask yourselves what would be the
effect on railroads. Suppose we have a de
ficiency in currency. You may say you don't
care anything about the railroadsâ they have
no souls} true, but the trainmen have. If their
pay went down, how is it going to be raised?
Your streetcars in California here can charge
you only 5 cents. Suppose that 5 cents be
comes 2Ji cents, how are the employes of that
railroad to be satisfied with it?
I don't profess to be any special friend of
the laboring man anymore than any other
citizen, but I am interested in him Jor the
simple reason that wage-earners and salary
earners belong to the same class. I am a
salary receiver, whether I am a salary-earner
or not, and thi9 class comprises 70 per cent of
the people and upon them depend the pros
perity and hopes of this country.
The hone of civilization consists In the bet
ter distribution ot wages and salaries; con
stantly increasing salaries as profits come in
are for the advantage of the whole world as well
as for the workingmen, because it is the wages
of the workingmen which constitute the
great purchasng fund of this country. It is
not the rich meu who keep the mills going;
we buy the products of our mills and our
minesâ that is, all of us togetherâ and what
ever decreases the fund belonging to the
wage-earners and salary-earners sets back civ
ilization so much.
What is the effect of the decreasing dollar
oi the workingmHii? I ask the workingmen
whether wages have ever raised of their own
accord? What the effect is is proved by the
history nf the United States.
In 1861 and down to 1864 we had a depreci
ating: currency, and during that time the
prices of all commodities went up 132 per
cent. What happened to wages? They went
up only 48 per cent, so that during that lime
the workingman lost 84 per cent oi his wages.
How did tnnt happen?
Labor is perishable and gets lost. If you
have to-day's work to sell you have got to sell
it to-day, and you can't spend much time argu
ing with the boss about it, for if you do you
will have so much less of that day's labor to
sell. Then, again, if you have a day's labor to
sell in Oakland you have to sell it here. You
can't sell it in New York; you can't sell it
hardly in San Francisco, lor half your day
would be gone before you got there. But with
a barrel of flÂ»ur the case is different. If you
can't sell it to-day, you can sell it to-morrow,
and if you can't sell it here you can sell it in
ban h'rancisco.
There is no class of people on earth who
ought to shun a depreciated currency like the
wage-workers and the salary-earner*. That is
the history of the world from its very founda
tion until nowâ that the farming cla>sand the
laboring class are those that suffer from a de
preciated currency. Those men tell us we
want higher prices. What did they tell us
four years ago? They said we wanted lower
prices and we have got them. I want neither
higher prices nor lower prices; what I want is
fair prices.
I waut to buy everything as low as I can,
subject to this idea that there shall be a fair
and honest wage tor the laboring man. Farm
ers need lear nothing except from that which
attacks everybodyâ namely, overproduction in
the world. It is not sliver that has put wheat
and the reat of the farmers' products down; It
is the ruin and disaster which those men have
made, combined with the opening of new
wh< at fields in other parts of the world.
Why not use a 11. tie sense about this thing
and not believe what those meu tell yon, when
you Know that what they told you four years
ago has turned out to be a falsehood?
I have just a word or two more to any. This
country is going right, and we waut California
to do her part of it We want California to
face tne rising and not the getting pun. We
want her great resources opened. We want
her not to keep out the capital that she needs
by joining this movement and creating uncer
tainty and destroying business confidence.
Why is it thatali over thu country the business
men have risen as one man? It is because they
know that the present condition of affairs is
ruining the country.
But when to-morrow's sun sets and the next
day's sun rises you w ili find at the head of the
column McKinley and Hoburt, because they
represent peace, confidence and prosperity
and an increase of the standing of the Lulled
States of America.
I bespeak irom this audience the favor of
hearing from the lady that In to follow me.
I am not disposed to argue any questions not
involved in the Republican National success
in this campaign, but I should be recreitnt In
my notions of duty if I did not say to a Califor
nia audience that 1 have never heard of any ar
gument that cou.U lc urged for manhood
tiuffrage that could nut be urged for woman
suff-a-e, nor an argument against the one
that would not be an argument against the
other.
Anna Shaw was warmly greeted, and re
sponded with a smile as cordial as the
greetin.-. She began by paying Mr. Heed
a compliment for his friendship to the
cause of woman suffrage, and sakl that
Miss Kiltie Reed, his daughter, who was
at that moment sitting by his side, was a
member of the Woman Suffrage Society.
The women would like to Have Mr. Reed
nominated for the Presidency, and it
would have been impossible for the Re
publican party to have nominated any
leading Republican who was not in favor
of the entranchisement of women.
The Republicans of Alarueda County,
she said, would be recreant to their plat
form if they didn't vote lor woman's free
dom, for the women were looking to tne
Republican party to do what they could.
All that she asked was justice, and it
never raid to be unjust.
Miss Shaw added:
I would like to ask every workingman
here if he does not believe that the working
women of this country are not as much inter
ested in this campaign as tne workingmen and
if he does not believe that the working woman
suffers when anything goes wrong equally
with the workingman. I want to say to the
men, remember that the women bave help d
to pay the debt of this country equally with
the men. The women of the country did not
make the debt, but you made the debt and we
help to pay it. Now, we want to help you to
keep from making so many debts that neither
you nor we may have to pay them.
You talk about the resources of California;
about the future of Ca.ifornia. Gentlemen,
there is no future of California that will be
greater than the future of justice, ihe future
of richt, the future of honesty, the future of
the equnlity of all its people.
The speaker denied that the men alone
had made California what it is, and called
attention to the village of Angels Camp,
in Calaveras County, wnicli received its
name because of the presence of a woman
Herein the early days. On the question
of taxation without representation, Mrs.
Shaw said :
Don't you think it's a mean virce of busi
ness to count the heads of the women of this
State to make up the members of Congress and
not allow the heads of the women of this State
to have a representation there? Taxation
without representation is tyrnnny. Do you
tax any women here in Oakland? Do you rep
resent them?
I Heard the other <Jay that in Oakland you
had a precinct where there were seven men
and sixty widows. The seven men had no
booth to vote in, but they had a special booth
put up for them at a cost of $80. Who paid
for the booth? The sixty widows who hadn't
a vote, and not one of the seven men who
voted paid a dollar of taxes, yet you say "we
men represent you in the Government." Some
times you do and sometimes you don't. â¢ â¢ â¢
I have talked ever since the 15th of March
day after day, and most of ihe time twice a
day. I spoke down on the docks to the long
shoremen and they are as good an audience as
you are.
Some of the newspapers have been telling
you how to vote; but 1 believe that the man
who is fit to vote should be capable of know
ing how without instructions. When Mr.
Reed snid that you could not hire the news
papers on this coast I wondered when I read
the paper this morning advising men to vote
against the sixth amendment. No man can be
true to the principles oi Republicanism and
vote against the sixth amendment. A man
cannot tie a Democrat and vote against it, let
alone a Republican. The man who calls him
self a Democrat and votes against the sixth
amendment is far away fiom the Jeffersonian
lden oi Democracy. Democracy is the right of
tho'e who obey the laws to take part in the
making of the laws.
No true Populist can vote against this amend
ment. You would be a funny Populist If you
voted against this amendment. Just thin* of
a Popuiist voting for a monopoly I is there a
more unjust monopoly than the monopoly of
sexâ one sex monopolizing all the rights of
both sexes ?
The speaker closed with a stirring ap
peal for justice for the fair sex.
Miss busan B. Anthony, in response to
an urgent call, addressed a few wordsjo
the audience, advising them to vote for
the sixth amendment first, so as not to
forget it, and the audience dispersed with
around of cheers for McKinley and Ho
bart.

To the Public: I have withdrawn as candi

my candidacy only tends to widen the breach,
I desire in the interest of harmony in the

LAST WORDS OF
THE DEMOCRATS
Mass- Meeting of Bryan's
Supporters at Metro
politan Hall.
California's Glorious Climate Re
stores Orator Taylor's
Health.
MR. CHANDLER'S WARM WOBDS
Highly Praised the N brask nâ W
P. Stradley and Reel Terry En
livened the Occasion
The Democrats and silver advocates of
San Francisco offered ''the last word" of
the campaign to their fellow-citizens at
Metropolitan Temple last night, a large
audience being present.
The meeting was called to order by
Richard E. Kelly. Judge A. W. Thomp
son, as chairman of the evening, spoke of
the great interests that are at stake in the
election of to-day, and introduced M. F.
Taylor of Colorado as the first speaker.
Mr. Taylor said that he came to Cali
fornia threo months ago broken in health
and that by making speeches to Demo
crats and -silver men and incidentally
breathing the balsamic ozone-burdened
atmosphere of the State he had grown
stout and well once more. He paid a
glowine tribute to Henry M. Teller.
Referring to last Saturday's parade of
the friends of McKinley and sound money,
Mr. Taylor said he was compelled to ad
mit t'.jat it was a magnificent display, yet
he could not help wondering that some
one should not have called out to the peo
ple, '"What came ye out for to see?' 1
Mr. Reed was freely criticized for what
Mr. Taylor said was opposition to the in
terests of the people of California, and be
predicted that Mr. Roed would find a dif
ference between counting a quorum in
Congress and counting a quorum at the
ballot-box in California.
Mr. Taylor protested against the action
of Mark Hanna in setting asid* "a flag
day" for the adherents of Mr. McKinley.
W. P. Lawlor, chairman of the Cali
fornia Silver Campaign Committee, said a
few words in regard to the work of the
closing campaign, after which W. H.
Alford, chairman of the Democratic cam
paign, spoke with great felicity concern
ing some of the things that he has seen
done to advance the cause of Mr.
B^yan. He cou d see no reason why Mr.
Bryan should be defeated. Hon. Jefferson
Chandler had been with Mr. Brvan during
a treat part of his campaign, and Mr.
Brvan had predicted, "I believe that my
majority in the electoral college will be at
least 100."
Mr. Chandler, the next speaker, said he
wished he could speak of Mr. Bryan as he
deserved. He added :
From the beginning of the campaign Mr.
Bryan has not made an unfortunate remark.
If he had done so the newspapers would have
caught it up and it would have been bandied
about by all the speakers and writers of the
Republican party.
I tell you that this is the opportunity of the
people of the country. You who hear me to
night, you have the matter in your own hands.
If you to-morrow fail to support Mr. Bryan
with your votes then forever remain quiet
about your wrongs. He is a man with no
mental reservations.
Mr. Alford said he desired to introduce
W. P. Stradley, who at his own expense
and without the hope or expectation of
reward, bad traveled over the State, speak
ing in the interest of free silver and Wil
liam Jennings Bryan.
Mr. Stradley said that his voice and
strength had been broken down by the se
vere tax that had been put on it, yet he
was not willing to go to bed without say
ing one more word on behalf of the Ne
braskan, W. J. Bryan.
Thereupon Mr. Stradley proceeded to
speak for about thirty minutes, going over
much of the ground that he covered in his
speech from the same platform last week.
He laid particular stress on the import
ance of beating the refunding bill and in
sisted that it was advisable to send James
G. Mapuire to Congress from the Fourth
Congressional District.
It is true, Mr. Stradley said, that a great
many gold Democrats have left the Bryan
column, but he rejoiced to say that for
every Democrat who had thus deserted
the cause true disciples of Abraham L.n
coln had come in to take their places.
Mr. Alford said that Mr. Reed was not
loaded with a good message for the people
of California.
Continuing in this strain, Mr. Maguire
E-ive an account of Mr. Reed's acts in
Congress in regard to the funding bill.
After that the remonetization of silver
was taken up and the usual arguments
that are so familiar to The Call's readers
were presented.
Mr. Mazuire said he had been informed
that printed documents derogatory to
himself were being secretly circulated in
the Fourth Congressional District. He
relied on the sentiment of justice which
is so strong in the hearts of all Americans.
Reel B. Terry entertained the audience
with a rattling speech full of elocutionary
pyrotechnics, in which he ridiculed "cer
tain sycophantic lawyers who rushed into
print ami into processions for the purpose
of getting favors from Judges by de
nouncing the Cnicago platform on which
Mr. Bryan stands."
Thomas V. Cator made his usual speech,
during which a great many left the all,
and the audience being thus reduced it
was considered best to take an adjourn
ment.
Democratic meetings were also held last
night at Lafayette Hall and Union Hall.
Every American citizen wh> cagts his
ballot for McKinley will look back with
pride to this day, knowing that he did
his shnre in saving the honor of the
Republic.
THE LAST RALLY.
The Voters of the Forty-Third Dls-
trlct Greet the Nominees.
The Republica voters of the Forty
third District filled the largest room in
Washington Hall last night to greet the
municipal nominees.
The chair was occupied by John H.
Durst, ex-City and County Attorney, who
on calling the meeting to order stated
that the Republicans of the Forty-third
District took this opportunity of inviting
the incoming municipal officers to be
present and exchange the compliments of
a successful campaign.
At this time Colonel C. L. Taylor en
tered the hall, and no sooner had he been
recognized than a spontaneous cheer went
up. He was almost earned on to the
platform by the eager crowd who sur
rounded him.
He thanked them kindly for their devo
tion, patriotism and loyalty to the Repub
lican party, and said he was clad the cam
paign was at an end, and he had not a
"little" bit of doubt as to the grand result
to-night
He again thanked them for the courte
ous reception he had received and prom
ised io devote his whole time to the inter
est of the people during the next two
years.
The presence of George W. Elder was
discovered in the -hall. This had the effect
of again starting the enthusiastic boys of
the FprtyÂ«th rd with an outburst ol more
cheering, wh eh required several attempts
of the chairman to subside.
Eventually quiet was restored, when Mr,
Elder mounted the platform and reiter
ated the policy which he will pursue if
elected, a result he had no doubt of.
"Honest John" Lackmann, F. Ij. Tur
pin, nominee for School Director, Judges
Joachirasen, Low. Kerrigan and Groezin
ger, Carroll Cook and C. R. Bones tell,
nominees for the Superior Court, J. R.
Aitken, nominee for City and County At
torney, and Fred Linguist, the nominee
for the Assembly, all were Introduced and
all spoke with confidence of a RepuDlican
victory to-day.
With song, music by the band and a con
tinuous roai of cheers (or the Republican
party, McKinley and Hobart and the en
tire municipal nominees, a most enthusi
astic crowd of young and old Republicans
closed the campaign of 1896.
A Tote for William A. Deane for
Auditor is a vote for a man of sterling
honesty and superior abilities.
William A. Deane Indorsed.
A large and enthusiastic assemblage â 
gathered last evening in Carr's Hall, on
the corner of Sutter street and Central
avenue, to indorse W. A. Deane in his
contest for Auditor.
Major Crawl spoke at length ana pre
dicted a sure victory.
Remarks were male in the same vein by

BEff TO-DAT.
COULDN'T DRINK COFFEE.
Wouldn't Be Put off With Chocolate
or Tea.
"And yon might bring me a cup of weaic
coffee, too," a busy man said to a restau-
rant waiter when giving an order.
"What makes you call lor weak coffee,
Bam?" a friend remarked.
"Oh, I have no business to drink coffee
anyhow, but I don't care for cbocolate or
tea, and do like coffee, although it
raises tne old Harry with my nerves and
stomach."
Many a man fails in business because of
his physical inability to attend to it prop-
erly. When a man wakes up and looks
squarely at himself and his affairs lie will
break off those habits that weaken his
body and prevent him from pushing hia
plans to a successful issue.
Tobacco and coffee seem so harmless
that a man feels they cannot hurt him
seriously and for that reason sticks to
them day after day until his nerves give
out and a long period of nervous prostra-
tion sets in. While a man is sick his
business goes toâ well, experience shows
that it don't go r'ght, and that a sick
spell is a wonderfully expensive invest-
ment.
Quit the poisonous habit, and nature
will slowly rebuild the broken system
without the use of medicines.
It is not so bard to give over coffee when
one can have Postum, a beverage which
looks like the finest Mocha coffee, and
crams up with the golden brown ol rich
old Java. It is very nourishing and fat-
tening, and has the pungent, piquant
taste demanded by the coffee drinker; at
the same time it can be used by childitm
as well as adults.
Nothing which nature furnishes is su-
perior to the grains for making gray mat-
ter in the brain and nerve centers. Posium
the food drink, is made wholly and en-
tirely of the grains. It can truly be said
to "make red blood." In comparison with
coffee its cost is about one-third. Grocers
sell it, or the Postum Cereal Company
(limited) of Battle Creek, Mich., send
enough for tif ty cups for 25 cents.
Beware of tne fraudulent imitations of
the original Postum Cereal Grain coffe*.
Insist on Postum.

get prosperity.
Uphold the great party of National
honor and National prosperity.
Don't forget the interests of industry
when you go into the voting-booth.
Stand np to-day for the welfare of Cali
fornia. Vote for protection to all her in
dustries.
Vote for Loud. Vote for O'Brien. Let
us have no free-traders from California in
the next Congress.
Stand by your party organization, loyal
Kepublicans. Vote for Colonel Taylor
and the whole ticket.
You are to decide to-day whether Amer
ican goods shall be made by American
labor or by foreigners.
What has Bryan ever done for American
industry? What has he ever done for
American workingmen.
Bear in mind that McKinley is the
champion of American labor, the friend of
every American workingman.
Protection gave the Nation a revenue
adequate to its needs, but free trade has
given it a deficit of $200,000,000.
Remember there is not a silver country
on earth where the wages of labor are as
high as in gold-using countries.
Four years ago the people voted for a
panic and got it. Now let them vote for
prosperity and they will get that.
Work and vote for the Republican legis
lative ticKet and make sure of sending to
the United States Senate a man who
rightly represents the State.
Will you vote to reduce the purchasing
power of your wages? Will you vote to
reduce the value of the pensions paid to
tne defenders of the Nation?
The American people are using more
silver money per capita than any silver
standard country in the world, and every
dollar of it is kept as good as gold.
Vote for tbe Republican Congressman
in your district. Let us have protection
ists to look after the industries of Califor
nia when the new tariff bill is made up.
Back of Bryan are Aitgeld, TMman,
Coxey and Debs, while around McKinley
are clustered all the statesmen of the Na
tion. Think what that means and then
vote.
Tbe best thing for honest-money Demo
crats to do to-day is to vote for the Mc-
Kinley and Hobart electors. We should
take no chances with Bryanism in Cali
fornia.
This has been something more than a
partisan contest. It has been a campaign
for the honor and credit of the Nation,
and every patriot will cast his vote with
that understanding.
Remember at the polls the invocation of
McKinley: "'May we all be inspired by
the same blessed spirit of patriotism that
moved the grand and great men who
founded our Government."
The wages of American workingmen
were higher when Harrison went out of
office than they had ever been before, and
they did not fall until Cleveland went into
office with the threat of free trade.
Every Industry in California suffered
from the effects of the Wilson bill, and yet
Bryan declared he wished still lower
duties. He is an extreme free-trader and
cares nothing for American industry.
As the champion of protection for all
American industries McKinley is tbe
supporter of the personal interests of each
particular citizen, and when you work for
him you are working for the welfare of
your own home.
Under the policy of protection the Na
tional debt was diminished in twenty
three years from over 12,000,000,000 to
$586,000,000, while under three years of
free trade it has been increased by $162,
-000,000. Which policy will you vote for?
THE FINAL APPEAL.
Vote early to-day, and when you have
voted get out and work to see that every
other right thinking citixen votes also.
Vote for National prosperity, for good
municipal government, for the Republican
legislative ticket and for the sixth amend
ment to the constitution which means
woman's suffrage.
Vote for the Republican Presidential
electors. A vote for them is a vote tor
McKinley and Hobart, for protection, for
sound money, for the maintenance of law,
for tbe revival of business, for good wages
and for National honor and integrity.
Vote against the Presidential electors who
stand for Democratic free trade, depres
sion, disaster and Popocratic free silver,
disturbance, debased money and lawless
ness.
Vote for the Republican legislative
ticket, which means the election of a Re
publican to the United States Senate who
will guard the interests of the industries
of California when the tariff is revised by
the next Congress. Vote against legisla
tors who are pledged either directly or in
directly for a Democrat, a Popocrat or a
Populist, for a free trader, a free silverite
or an agitator.
Vote for Republican candidates for those
offices whose incumbents constitute the
San Francisco Election Commission. The
offices are: Mayor, Auditor, Surveyor,
City Attorney and Tax Collector. San
Francisco has been for too long a time
under tbe control of an Election Commis
sion made up mainly of Democrats. We
must have honest men on that board. Be
sure ana vote )or Republican candidates
for those offices.
Vote for Colonel Taylor and the regular
Republican municipal ticket. These men
stand for organized Republicanism which
is the only force in the City that can be
counted on for good government. Vote
against men who were nominated by bosses
and are supported by them. A vote for the
regular Republican ticket is a vote for
honest men in office, municipal economy,
improvement and progress.
Vote for constitutional amendment No.
6. It means woman's suffrage. The
women of California deserve tbe right to
vote. They are taxpayers. They are citi
zens. They represent social forces that
make for the betterment of society. Suf
frage in their hands would tend to purify
politics and bring about great political and
social reforms. If given the suffrage they
can be counted on in all future elections
to act for the best interests of the people,
for the promotion of the weliare of the
City and the advancement of the State.
Vote for these things and for these men.
Work as well as vote. Nearly every citi
zen can afford to give much of his time to
day to politics. This is the opportunity
of labor and of business. This is the day
to rebuke Clevelandism and repudiate Bry
anism. Tnis is the occasion to overthrow
municipal bosses. Go to the polls. Work
and vote. Make yourself count as a cham
pion of patriotism, protection and pros
perity. ______________
The Republican party proposes, "when
ever restored to fall power, inch a re
vision of tbe tariff aa will secure suffi
cient revenue to put an end to the
ehronlo deficiency which has existed
more than three years and still exists,
and as will also provide a surplus from
â which the redemption fund may be re
plenished in time of need, and the in
terest-bearing debt gradually reduced ;
and at the same time with duties so
adjusted on protective lines as to en
courage American industries and labor,
and such other legislation, not to enter
into details, as the Republican par y
has championed and the public inter
ests require. â Hon. Nelson Dingley.
VOTE TOE TAYLOR.
Colonel Charles L. Taylor is the nominee
of the regular Republican party of this
County. He is the representative of the
butiness elements of tne people of San
Francisco. He is the faithful champion
of the welfare of the people. His fidelity,
sagacity and honesty are attested both by
his private life and by his services to tbe
City on the Board of Supervisors. Vote
for him. Give your aid to the better ele
ment of the people in the task of making
him the next Mayor of San Francisco.
Loyal Republicans, vote for Colonel
Taylor and maintain the organization of
your party. Vote for him because he
represents the discipline, the loyalty and
the integrity of Republican organization,.
Vote for him because the time has come
to make San Francisco a Republican city,
and give it that good government and
honest administration which all Republi
can voters desire.
Independent citizens, vote for Colonel
Taylor because he is the opponent of the
bosses. Ha is associated neither with
Buckley nor Rainey nor Kelly, nor with
any of their gangs. He represents clean
politics. He is tbe associate of men who
desire good government. Back of him
stand the business men and the working
men of the City. He has no pledges which
bind him to support any thiDg which mili
tates against public welfare, and if elected
will (rive to the City that municipal re
form which has been so long needed.
Good citizens all, vote for Colonel Tay
lor. He is one of those citizens who make
up the strength of the municipality, and
whose enterprise constitutes the motive
force of its progress. It is a matter of
congratulation to the people of San Fran
cisco to have an opportunity of electing
such a man to the office of Mayor. He
stands for improvement, economy and
honesty. He is the man for the office and
for the time. Vote for him and make
sure of an administration in which all peo
ple of San Francisco can take a just pride.
ELECTION COMMISSIONERS.
Among the important municipal offices
to be filled by election to-day are those
whose incumbents are ex-officio Election
Commissioners. These offices are Mayor,
Auditor, Surveyor, City and County At
torney and Tax Collector. Three of theae
offices are now in the hands of Democrats,
and tho Mayor was elected as a Populist,
so that only one man orr the commission
is a Republican.
A condition similar to this has pre
vailed fora long time, and It behooves the
Republicans of the City to see to it that
this year they elect a majority of these
officers. It is clear that so long as our
election machinery is in the hands of
Democratic officials, who in many cases
are but the tools of Democratic bosses,
fair elections are almost an impossibility.
Tbe scandals of past elections are fresh in
the minds of all voters, and we need but
recall them to enable every citizen to see
bow important it is to make a change in
this respect.
The men to be voted for for these offices
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1896.
are: Charles L. Taylor for Mayor, Wil
liam A. Deane for Auditor, C. H. Wet jen
for Tax Collector, John R. Aitkeu for
Attorney and Charles L. Tilton for Sur
veyor. Remember the names, remember
the offices and remember the importance
of the issue.
The men nominated by the regular
Republican party for these offices are in
every way worthy of the positions to
which they aspire. No man can question
their ability to till the official positions
for which they have been nominated, cor
can it be doubted that they will be just
and fair in theif action? as Election Com
missioners. Vote for every one of them.
Let us put an end to election 'scandals and
make sure of a Board of Commissioners
who will be a credit to the City and im
partial managers of all elections.
The other nations of the world have
their separate and Independent political
organizations for the purpose of work
ing out for themselves the highest des
tiny possible. They owe no allegiance
to this Government; they contribute
nothing to its support, either in war or
in peace, and if they are to come Into
this country and compete with oar peo
ple, we say that you can do it upon con
dition that a tariff shall be put npon
your products, and that tariff wil! go to
ward sustaining this Government, and
at the same time will be a defense to our
own laborers and producers.â McKinley.
BEING OUT THE VOTE.
The Weather Bureau reports as a fore
cast for California to-day fair weather
with brisk westerly winds. This is a good
omen for the success of the Republican
party. The men who compose that party,
representing as they do tbe classes who
are most accustomed to the comforts and
conveniences of cultured life, are too often
fair-weather voters. With tbe most earn
est desire for the welfare of the country,
they are not infrequently over-?anguine in
their dependence upon tne popular vote,
and when tne weather is bad neglect to
perform the duty of citizens by going to
the polls and voting and working lor the
ticket which stands for National pros
perity.
To-day the forecast is for fair weather,
and for that reason we may look for a
large Republican vote. Should the weather
change suddenly, however, there should
be no change in tbe determination of good
citizsns to go to the polls. Be the weather
good or bad, there is but one election day.
Whoever wishes to vote for sound money,
for protection, for law and order, must
vote to-day.
The best plan for every one to adopt is
to go to the polls and vote as early as pos
sible in the day, and then give whatever
time he can spare to the work of bringing
out others. The vole of every ri^ht think
ing man should be polled. The sentiment
of the business men and industriouswork
ingmen of California is overwhelmingly
on the side of McKinley and Hobart.
That much was made evident by the great
parade on Saturday. Public sentiment,
however, will avail little to-day. The only
thiug that will count now is a vote. Un
less ttie full strength of Republicans and
honest money Demoratsis registered at
the polls by ballots cast for the Republican
Presidential electors all that has been done
in the campaign for sound money and good
government will go for nothing.
All over the Union ballots will be falling
in the ballot-boxes to-day as fast as au
tumnal leavts when they are strewn by
the winds of November. If they are cast
from motives of patriotism and with an
intelligent desire to serve the welfare of
the Republic, they will be a blessing to
every industry and to every citizen. But
it cast from motives of prejudice, bate or
passion they are likely to prove injurious
to every hope of the Republic and every
good of the people.
It is true that the vitality of tha Re
public will not be affected by the re
snlt, but it i* equally true that its pros
perity will largely depend upon which
side the majority of the ballots is cast.
The issues before us are not slight nor
transient. They will have long-lasting
effect upon tbe history of the Nation, and
it is therefore a solemn duty on the part
of every good citizen to vote for that side
which tends to maintain the growing good
of the American people and the honor and
integrity of the Nation.
I hÂ«Te heard men say that with free
silver they could sell their property at
increased price and pay off their mort
gage with the money. Is that honest?
No man nor nation can afford to be dis
honest. Every nation that has done so
has suffered. Whenever yon take froiu a
man the hatred of what is wrong you
make him so low that he pulls down
with him all who associate with him.
General L. T. Michener.
VOTE FOR NINE
California is entitled to nine representa
tives in the electoral college. Every voter
in California is entitled to vote for the
whole nine. This fact should be borne in
mind at the polls. No voter should vote
for less than the full number of Presiden
tial electors, for by doing otherwise he
would deprive himself of a portion of his
rigbts as a citizen of the United States.
The nine men to be voted for are with
their voting numbers as follows:
10. IRVING M. SCOTT.
1L DUNCAN E. McKINLAY.
12. GEORGE M. FRANCIS.
13. JULIUS M. WALLING.
14. HOWELL A. POWELL.
15. JOSEPH S. SPEAR JR.
16. CLAUS SPRECKELS.
17. ELWOOD COOPER.
18. THOMAS FLINT.
These men represent tbe Republican
party of California. If elected they will
vote for McKinley and Hobart for Presi
dent and Vice-president of the United
States. Every one of them should be
elected. If either of them should be de
feated there wili be one vote less in the
electoral college for the Republican can
didates. All advocates of prosperity, all
champions of sound money, ail supporters
of law and order, all opponents of Bryan,
Altgeld and Tulraan, Coxey and Debs
should vote for these men. Bear in mind
you are entitled to vote for every one of
them. Don't forget it at the polls. Vote
for nine. . ' .-'
THE LEGISLATIVE TICKET.
As at present constituted the Senate of
tbe United States is in the hands of
neither of the great political parties of the
country. Republicans and Democrats are
nearly tied, and the PoDulists and free
silverites hold the balance of power. A
strong tight is being made in every State
where a Senator is to be elected for the
purpose of winning control of the Senate
for one side or the other. To that tight
every voter must direct his attention.
The next Legislature of California is to
elect a United (states Senator. Whether
he is to be a Republican who stands for
protection and sound money or an advo
cate of free trade and free silver depends
upon the constitution oi the Legislature of
the State. If the people of California de
sire that their industries should be pro
tected they must elect a protectionist
Senator this winter. Stephen M. White,
the Democratic free-trader, will bold over,
and if a protectionist is not elected we
will have in the United States Senate no
representative of California to look after
our industries when the tariff is revised,
as it surely will be by the next Congress.
Every citizen will see from this the im
portance of electing Republicans to the
State Legislature. Vote for the Repub
lican candidates for the Assembly and the
State Senate in your district. If they are
defeated the majority in the Legislature
may be in the hands of the fusion man
agers, and that would almost surely mean
the election to the Senate of Thomas V.
Cator. The issue involved in the legis
lative ticket is therefore one of the most
important now before the people.
We must send to the United States Sen
ate a man who will support the McKinley
administration. Bear this in mind. Talk
of it to your friends. Work as well as
vote for the legislative ticket. The Re
publican candidates should be elected in
every district in this City in order that the
State may be made sure of a United States
Senator who will represent its people and
defend its industries.
WHERE TO SEE THE BULLETINS.
There is but one bulletin board in San
Francisco to-day where the news of the
election can be read by many thousand
people without the slightest incon
venience or straining of the eyes. That
splendid stretch of canvas is on the great
Call building, Third and Market streets.
The day bulletins will be displayed in
front of The Call business office, and the
night news will be flashed by stereopticon
upon a canvas 20x36 feet, which is
stretched in front of the fourth story of
the new Call build insr.
The public will have an unbroken view
from O'Farrell and Market streets almost
;o Montgomery, and from a point nearly
as far as Post street on Kearny. Thus
thousands will be able to read the news
without huddling into little crowds in the
middle of the street, thereby taking the
risk of being run over by vehicles. The
height of the large bulletin sheet is such
that it is plainly visible (or a long distance,
and nobody's head will obscure anybody
else's view.
The Call, moreover, will give the latest,
moat accurate and complete returns that
money and modern facilities can produce.
Returns from every State in the Union
and from the great news centers will be
flashed upon the canvas without delay.
The bulletins will be written on glass with
india ink, or impressed upon gelatine
slides by the typewriter process, so as to
be legible to all without the slightest
straining of the eyes.
Arrangements have been perfected for
speedy returns from every precinct in the
City, and the results of voting on the mu
nicipal ticket wili be flashed upon the can
vas at the earliest possible moment.
The Call's service on the general result
will consist of the United Associated Press
returns, which are now admitted to be
the most complete and accurate in the
United States.
If you want to know the news at the
earliest possible moment to-night station
yourself anywhere along Market or
Kearuy streets within sight of The Call's
mammoth new building, and the stereop
ticon will do the rest.
WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE.
Vote for amendment No. 6. It proposes
to chance the present law by omitting the
word male in denning the qualifications of
electors in this State. It gives suffrage to
the women of California as weil as to
men. It establishes equality before the
law and confers upon all the people the
rights which have hitherto been confined
to one-half of them only.
The women of California deserve the
right to vote. They have shared with
men all the burdens and toil and dangers
of building up this State from its former
condition oi a Mexican province to its
present proud position as one of the lead
ing commonwealths of the American Re
public Women were among the pioneers
of the Btate. They aided in its early set
tlement. They assisted in providing its
schools, its churches and its home*. Their
influence transformed the roughness of
the early days into the culture that exists
now. They are among the foremost edu
cators of the State, among its most earnest
and industrious workers, and not a few of
tliem rank among its greatest taxpayers.
Women have rights which are affected
by legislation as well as men. They have
interests to be guarded by good laws as
well as men. They have property to be
taxed as well as men. Their intelligence,
their integrity and their patriotism, to
say the least, is not less than that of men.
To them, therefor â¢, by every principle of
reason, justice and expediency is the privi
lege of voting to be accorded. The Re
publican party, in its State convention,
pledged itself to support the cause of
woman's suffrage, and that pledge should
be remembered and kept by every Re
publican at the polls.
Nor should it be Republicans only who
vote for the amendment.
The issue is one which appeals to the
better instincts of men of all parties. All
therefore should vote for it. Let us make
this day a day of triumph, not only for
National prospe rity but for the enfran
chisement of the women of California.
BEWARE OF CANARDS.

BATTLE ENDS

Up the Great Cam
paign.
Ladies Assist in the Celebra

rium
LONG LIST OF ABLE SPEAKERS-
An Enthusiastic Audienca Loudly Ap
plauds Republican Doc
trine.
What was styled "the last grand jubilee
of the campaign of 1896" was held in the
Auditorium last evening, under the au
spices of the McKinley Invincibles. Tha
term of "jubilee" was not misap
plied, for the house was crowded
with enthusiastic and cheering advocates
of McKinley and Hobart, protection and
sound money. A large attendance of
ladies was a feature. In honor of them a
handsome souvenir on gold-colored paper
was circulated containing an interesting
and varied programme.
The exercises of the evening began sim
ultaneously in doors and out. An orches
tra played a meJley of patriotic tunes,
some of which had to be repeated in re
sponse to tha demands of the
large audience. A firing squad on
the outside of the building dis
played rockets, while the crowd was
gathering and until about time for the
exercises to begin. A large part of the
sta^e was given up to the ladies, who oc
cupied practically all except the front row
of seat-, which were reserved for the pre
siding officer, the rice-presidents and the
speakers of the evening.
The formal programme was onened by
"Who Shall He Be?" with the refrain of
"McKinley's the Man." sung by a chorus
of male voices. Every mention of Mc-
Kinley's name was received with applause
and the singers were compelled to return
and sing unotuer song of the patriotic
sort.
J. B. Stetson, the presiding officer, then
said that it was tn time-honored custom
of the Invincibles to hold a praise service
the niahi before the election. At this
meeting there would be no attempt to in
flunce the mind of any one. The minds of
all were practically made up. Those pres
ent were only wa'ting for to-morrow toar
nve to vote for McKinley. [Applause.]
E. F. Preston said ttiat discussion was
no longer necessary. The issues ha 4 al
ready been placed before the American
people. The battle had already
been fought and had already been
won. Never had there Deen such a cam
paign; never such acleavaeie^of party lines
ti rally around the flat; and the constitu
tion. [Applause.] When man was cre
ated, in nis breast was planted the in
stinct of self-preservation, and from that
instinct came government.
The battle, Mr. Preston repeated, had
been fought and been won. The parade of
Saturday was typical of the condition of
the pub:ic mind throughout the United
States, when all classes of men forsook
their daily work to march, each carrying
an American Hag.
The wave of socialism, of anarchism
would beat against a solid rock. To-mor
row McKinley would be elected and Bryan
and even Altgcld would know that the
American people would have no more of
them. [Cheers and applause.]
Miss Amy C. Hickox sang the "Ameri
can Hymn," and responded to an encore
with a repetition.
Edgar D. I'eixotto said that all
the arguments have been made.
Ail that was left to be done was
to ratify Republican principles and
the Republican candidate. He had
attended Democratic meetings, but couid
learn nothing tliere. There was no hope
in the Democratic party. The Republi
can party would give to ihe people pros
perity and work to labor.
Henry 1. Kowalsky reported that he had
spoken in ail the districts in San Fran
cisco. The indications were that the Re
publican party would Did good-by to Deni
ocratic fallacies for a long time.
Sam Booth and the California quartet
came in dressed m working clothes in the
character of tinkers, witn tin pans to
mend, and sang a song about "McKiniey's
Bill."
Mrs. Nellie Hoi brook- Blinn spoke in
favor of the sixth amendment, addressing
the audience as "fellow-Republscans."
She said that the Republican platform of
1896 remained true to Republican princi
ples as they have been since the party
came into power. Protection was still a
cardinal point of Republican belief. The
party was now striving for the restoration'
of business prosperity without compro
mise. The shibboleth is, "Down with
repudiators." The Republican party was
opposed to socialists and anarchists and
to those who threatened the very life of
the Nation.
The Chicago convention embraced the
most dangerous elements in the country
and in a moment of emotional insanity
they nominated a man who was noted not
for his statemanship but for his gab.
W. A. Richardson said he bad found
out that Calif rnia is all right. Southern
California would give 10,000 majority for
McKinley. Mr. Richardson criticised the
Chicago convention and said that no one
ever accused it of being Democratic.
He styled Senator Stewart "that
long-tailed bird of Paradise who
flies through heaven, and is too honest to
nest longer with the Republicans, and so
roosts with Altgeid and Pitchfork Till
man." The only silver man in the Bible
was Judas, and he became so disgusted
with the silver question that he went out
and hanged himself.
The Knickerbocker Quartet sang "Mc-
Kinley Is the Man," and for an encore,
'*Good-bv, Free Silver, Good-by."
A. P. Van Duzer said he did no t want
five minutes in which to convert a Demo
crat. The Democrats were already con
verted. McKinley was a man to talk
about. He went into the army as a boy.
He was no holiday soldier, but
stood in t c front rank. His met
tle was tried in the Shenandoah
Valley, riding into a volcano of flame and
leading out a brigade that was sur
rounded. Heaven preserved that Irttle
hero, for he had a mission. Now that an
archy was about to put its knife to the
throat of the Republic that hero was
ready to save the country. This was a
good time to renew allegiance to the
American flag.
Miss Amy C. Hickoz tang another
patriotic song.
Mrs. J. Murray iiaiiey aaid that the
troubla with Bryan was that he wanted
too much freedom and too little law. [Ap
plause.] It took a bruve motherhood to
found t he country. The first child born after
the arrival of the Mayflower was a girl,
which would seem to indicate that the
fair sex was early on hand and
not inclined to shirk responsibil
ity. [Applause.] Women did much
to lead to the result at Appo*
mattox. With such heroic ancestry, how
could women fail at this time to take an
active interest in public affairs and the
welfare of the Republic. She was a Re
publican, and much as sne valued the
ballot she would rather be a Renubli
can woman with no ballot than a
Democratic woman with two ballots.
[Applause and cheers.] The Republi
can party stood like an adamantine
rock for honesty, protection and patriot
ism. Every woman should make it her
duty to urge upon all her gentlemen
friends and acquaintances to vote for Mc-
Kinley, because around him cluster all

' ABSOLUTELY PURE
HORSES HAVE
THE INFLUENZA
Another Epidemic Spread
ing With Alarming
Rapidity.
Some of the Very Best Family
Nags in the City
Affected.
A HOSPITAL ESTABLISHED.
The Disease Is Serious and Painful
to tho Victims, but Not Many
Fatalities Are Reported.
A new epidemic is spreading with star
tling rapidity among the horses of the
City.
Veterinary surgeons have for the past
four or five days been kept on the jump in
answer to calls from every quarter of the
City.
The complaint is a form of influenza,
affecting the mucous lining of tbe bowels.
Technically the disease is known as an
enteric form of influenza. Victims of it
suffer greatly. The early symptoms are a
dullness and loss of appetite, followed
shortly by evidences of internal suffering.
The horse begins to paw and to stretch out
his fore leg as if appealing for relief. He
will, as his suffering increases, lie down
and roll, and in every way manifest his
distress.
The surgeons say the disease is not par
ticularly dangerous, but out of a great
number affected two or three deaths have
been reported.
Dr. Egan has established a hospital
near his Golden Gate avenne office, where
there are no less tnan eighteen horses
now afflicted with the disease, all gath
ered in within the past live days. "Iliave
scarcely had any sleep for three nights
past," said Dr. Egan yesterday, "I got
to bed at half-past 1 o'clock yesterday
morning and was called up at 4 o'clock,
and from that time until 10 at night I was
on tbe go from one place to another.
There certainly seems to be an epidemic
on, but I do not think it is dangerous. I
have had but one fatal case ?o far."
The disease does not confine itself to
any class or condition of horses. Some of
Lloyd Tevis' and other well-known family
horses are affected.
A vote for McKinley and Hobart lÂ» m
vote for more work, more money and
more prosperity.
TO WATCH OFFICIALS
The Grand Jury Will Have Its Eye on
Election Officers In the Booths
To-Â»ay.
The Grand Jury is taking more than
usual interest in tbe management ot tbe
election booths this year, and has sent a
number of communications to Registrar
Hinton on tbe subject. The jury will
make visits to booths and see what is go
ing on.
The Registrar has been requested to
send to each election board a warning
that it is illegal to have liquors in the
booths, and that any election officer
found intoxicated will be removed. The
Registrar is cutting off the supply of
passes demanded by candidates. Owing
to the large number oi aspirants in the
field, he fears that if all have representa
tives in the booths they will crowd the
officials.
No resident of the Fourth Congres
sional District who has the welfare of
San Francisco at heart can afford to
vote for that rank free trader, James G.

WILL WHICH THE COUNT
Members of the Grand Jury
to Visit the Voting
Places.
Crooked and Careless Work in Tally
ing Will Receive Atten
tion.
The Grand Jury held a session Sunday
night to discuss election affairs and take
preliminary steps to guard against fraud
in the counting of the vote. It was de
cided that the members of the jury,
two on each sub-committee, should visit
each precinct as the count progressed.
The division of. work was made by Assem
bly districts, so that every man knows the
territory 'o which he is assigned. Every
member of the jury will have a white
satin badge with the words "Grand Jury"
lettered thereon. This will entitle him to
admission to tbe voting places. Should
the visiting committee observe anything
crooked or careless in the tallying of the
ballots steps will be taken to enforce the
law.
Yesterday Frederick" Hobbs, foreman of
the Grand Jury, addressed the following
communication to the Election Commis
sion:
William if. Hinton, Registrar of Voters and
Secretary of Board of Election ( ommistionersâ
Dear Sib: lam instructed by the Grand Jury
to inform the Election Commissioners that
members of the Grand Jury will make regular
and systematic visits of inspection to all the
precinct polls during the counting of tne
ballots, and will report at once to your honor
able body any and all objectionable features
that mÂ«y come to their notice, and they par
ticularly request that immediate attention be
given to communications you may receive â by
telephone or otherwise â from any of their
members and a proper remedy appfiedatonce.
It is also the unanimous opinion of the
Grand Jury that the custom of having a con
tribution-box at the polling-places should be
discontinued and forbidden. This money is
contributed ostensibly for the purposes ot
charity, but in reality is^familiarly known as
"the kitty," and is taken by the precinct em
ployes and appropriated to the purchase of
liquors and cigars for their own use, and seri
ously interferes with the proper fulfillment of
their duties. The results are very injurious to
public interests. Very respectfully,
i kkiÂ»k. Ho Ã¼bs, Foreman Grand Jury.
Orders were issued in accordance with
the request prohibiting the use of contri
bution-boxes at the polls. The services of
tbe Grand Jury in assisting to promote
the purity of election are appreciated by

SLIDING FIGURES.
Democrats Are Scaling Down Their
Estimate of Bryan's Vote.
E. P. Troy, secretary of the Bryan Dem
ocratic State Committee, yesterday said
that according to bis estimate Mr. Bryan
will carry California Dy from 30,000 to 50,
-000 majority.
This is a revision with a material reduc
tion from format estimates made by Mr.
Troy, for heretofore he has claimed the
State for Mr. Bryan by a plump majority
of 50.000.
The 30,000 majority, Mr. Troy said, is
based on reports sent from different parts
of the State by the trusted agents ot the
State committee.
"Woman's Federation.
Great surprise was expressed by members oi
the Woman's Federation yesterday that the
Chronicle, a Republican paper, should nave
advised ita readers to vote against the suffrage
amendment. No action was taken at the meet
ing, but the stab from a paper which was sup
posed to be friendly to the planks in the Re
publican platform waa the subject of much,
surprised comment.
McKinley and Hobart's election would
not mean repudiation and National
financial dishonor. It would mean more
money to make the wheels go around
and a ratio of Increase in prosperity of
16 to 1.

BOOKMAKERS WERE
SCORCHED AGAIN
Five Out of Six Choices
Captured Purses at
Ingleside.
Nebuchadnezzar Beat Sir Flay
Out in the Mile
Handicap.
BELLICOSO IS GOOD FORM.
Installator Disposed of Midlo Very
Cleverlyâ lmp. Friar Let the
Crowd Down Hard.
Again yesterday first choices in the
betting had thines about their own way
at Ingleside. Had imp. Friar, a brown
horse owned by Marcus Daly, captured
the fifth race, for which he was a warm
favorite, the crowd would have had money
to buy gold bricks. As it was they did
very well, the long lines back of the
bookmakers' stands at the conclusion of
every race being testamentary to that fact.
The attendance was large and the bidding
exceptionally brisk.
Eddie Jonos. as usual, retained his win
ning form, landing two winners in clever
fashioD.
By far the best performance of the day
was that of Nebuchadnezzar, the pony
son of imp. Brutus. Carrying 101 pounds
in the mile handicap, and starting a 7 t 5
favorite, he allowed the second choice, Sir
Play, to cut out the running until a fur
long from the stand. Here Bob lsom
shook "Nebby" up, and outgaining the
leader, he gradually took the lead and
won by a scant length in the excellent
time of 1:41%. The two-year-old Lincoln
II ran a fine race, finishing a good third.
Thelma, the only other starter, was beaten
off.
Starter Harvey had thirteen maiden
two-year-olds to* handle in the opening
five and a half furlong scramble and he
sent them away to a magnificent start.
Scotch Rose, a "good thing" from the
stable of Ab Sternler, led the bunch until
well around the bend for home, when the
Bto 5 choice, Hanetta. carrying George
Rose's colors, assumed the lead and won
â¢easily by three lengths. February, a 5 to
1 shot, nipped Scotch Rose out for place
the last forty yards.
It certainly looked as though Instal
lator, with but 107 pounds on his back,
had fallen into a soft place in the next
event, a six-furlong sprint, yet the ring
in id as good as 4 >o 5 against his chances.
Midlo, carrying three pounds less -weight,
wiis heavily played to beat him at odds of
14 to 5 and worse. The latter geiding led
until well into the stretch, when McGlone
on the favorite overtook him and from
there on had it his own way, winning
cleverly by a couple of lengths in I:l5J^.
St. Aignon was third.
Naglee Burkes big colt Bellicoso expe
rienced little difficulty in disposing of his
company in the fourth event, at five and a
half furlongs, his favoxite distance.
Backed from evens to 7 to 10, he made all
tne running and won pulling up from La
Mascota, a 12 to 1 shot. Rosebud, the
Burns and Waterhouse entry, was a close
third. Imp. Santa Bella ran as though
short.
Another Hve and a half furlone run that
followed saw a much cheaper lot of horses
at the barrier. After seeing imp. Friar
warm up, the crov/d strung their coin on
the Montana horse's chance, and he re
warded them by finishing sixth. Yeragua,
the 3 to 1 second choice, ridden by Jones,
was in front tlie entire way. passing the
judges a clever winner from Ezell's Ran
ardine. The Spreckels entry, Therese, was
third.
Millionaire Cnarlps Fair's Una Colorado
was the warmest kind of a favorite for the
last race, over six and a half furlongs.
Starting at the short price of 3 to 5, he
waÂ« badly bumped about during the early
part of the running, but headed his field
in the stretch and easily disposed of Spry

Notes.
There will be no racing at Ingleside
Track to-day.
Nebuchadnezzar pulled op slightly
!Â«me at the conclusion of the handicap,
having probably wrenched an ankle.
W. L. Stanfield, the Texas horseman,
arrived at Oakland track yesterday with a
select string of horses that will experience
no difficulty in winning their oats. They
are: Dr. McAllister, Miss Gentry, Mike
Rice and Roltaire. The latter, a two-year
old, has been five times first and four
times second this season. In the same car
came Hotspur, Kowalsky, Jack Morton
and Reel. The latter horses are the prop
erty of Wade McLemore.
The horses owned by Tully, Coulter and
"Billy" Roller also got in yesterday and
are safely quartered at Oakland. Coulter
brought with him the very useful horse
Redskin, a good winner in the East the
past season.
Henry Shields was suspended by the
judge for the remainder of ttie meeting in
failing to ride Scotch Rose oat for the
place. H. Martin on February, who
caught iSmelds napping, finished with
both saddle girths broken.
As the horses were going to the post in
the fourth race, Captain Rees remarked to
H. Martin who rode La Mascota as he
passed the stand, that "the odds were go
in? up against him and he would like to
have him disappoint the crowd." A
word to the wise is generally sufficient,
and Martin, riding an excellent race,
landed tne fast mare a good second.
An effort was recently made on the part
of the present owners ol the horse Morgan
G to have the jumper, who was ruled off
together with his jockey owner, Joe John
son, abUt a year ago, reinstated. Presi
dent A. B. Spreckels requested the stew
ards of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club to
give the question their careful considera
tion. Ina communication banded to Sec
retary Leake yesterday, Captain Rees,
chairman of the board of stewards, says
that body fails to discoverjany extenuat
! ing circumstances, as fraud was clearly
j proven at the time of the ruling, and
horse and jockey must remain outlawed
from the turf. Captain Rees also states
that it ;s learned that Johnson is now in
the employ of Owner Matt Storn as
trainer, and that gentleman's attention is
called to rule 184 of the American racing
rules.
Protection to American Industries is
protection to the pockets of the people.
It means better goods and more money
with which to buy them.
SAMARITAN MISSION.
Its Work Explained to the Woman's
Auxiliary of the Kplscopat Church.
The Woman's Auxiliary of the Episco
pal Church met in semi-annual session
yesterday afternoon in the chapel of the
Mission of the Good Samaritan, at 249
Second street After listening to the
financial report of the treasurer for the
past six months and to the reading of let
ters from those in charge of the missions
in Alaska and at Baden, San Mateo
County, in which the missionaries made
known their needs, the Rev. William in
graham Kip Jr., in charge of the mission,
gave an interesting account of the new
work dene in the mission since the last
meeting.
He said that there are now 100 com
municants, in addition to about 400 who
come to the chapel, but the latter are not
regular attendants. There are now men's
weekly meetings and occasional literary
entertainments. Recently the men at
tending inese meetings partook of a din
ner, thirty being at the tabie, and the
expense did not exceed $6. Seveiai of the
ladies said they would visit tlie mission,
with a view to study domestic economy.
He then spoke of the woodyard, where
mensaw and split wooa, and in return are
furnished food at;d s.ieher; of the sewing
class, which numbers forty; of the Sab
baih-school, and of the cio'hing bureau,
where individuals who are properly rec
ommended can purchase wearing apparel
at a very small price. He cited several in
stances to show tne good influence of the
mission on the men who have attended it.
He closed with a description of the new
mission-house to be on the west side of
Second street, nud what will be done when
the new structure shall be occupied. An
account of this was recently published in
The Call.

GETS A CALL
The Fourth Congregational
Church Has a New
Pastor.
He Is a Native of Scotland, and
Was Educated in Ire
land.
IN THIS COUMTEY TEN YEARS
Aa Effort to Have the Law Closing
Saloons To-Day Strictly
Enlorced.
BÂ«T. J. P. Dickson has accepted a call
for a year to the Fourth Congregational
Church, which has been vacant since the
Rev. F. Fiawith returned to England.
Mr. Dickson is a native of Glasgow,
Scotland. He was educated in London
derry. Ireland, and at Belfast College. In
Edinburgh he was ordained into the Pres
byterian church, and made the confession
of faith, with the proviso, nowever, that
be could not subscribe 10 the doctrine of
i he damnation of infants.
Ten years aco Mr. Dickson came to this
City from New Zealand For six months
he was pastor-eiect of the Tabernacle.
Later hÂ» organized the Cumberland Pres
byterian Church, which held its meetings
in Mozart Hall, but about six months ago
he resigned on account of ill-health and
â with a number of hia flock he joined the
Rev. J. P. Dickson, the Pastor Who
Succeeds Rev. F. Flawith.
â¢Third Congregational Church. For the
last six weeks Mr. Dickson has acted as
supply at the Fourth Congregational
Church, and his preaching made such a
favorable-impression that he received a
call, which was accepted.
The Presbyterian Ministerial Union has
been makng efforts to have the law en
forced, which closes saloons on election
day. According to the report of Rev. R.
W. Reynolds, made before the union
yesterday there is little hope, however,
that the. law will be carried into effect.
Mr. Reynolds said that at the office of
the Chief of Police he had been informed
that the officers, if for personal reasons
alone, were most anxious to see the law
enforced, as the closing of the saloons
would s*ive them a vast amount of work
on election day. "Tfcp police judges are
at fau t," said Mr. Reynolds, "for the
police say that the police judges are out
lor votes, and it is impossible to gel them
to make a conviction on election day. As
fast as the patrol wagon brines men in,
tne judges release them without bail, and
on that account it is hopeless for the
police to try to keep the saloons closed on
election day, as the saioon-keepers simply
laugh at the police."
Regret was expressed by tbe parties
â present that such a report should be given
of tbe police judges, but no formal action
was taken in the matter.
ThepBperof the day at the Ministerial
Union was on "The Relation of Character
and Life to Preaching," and it was read
by=Dr. Professor Landon of San Anselmo.
Baptist Conference.
The Baptist Preachers' Conference yes
terday passed resolutions declaring the
racing establishment at Shell Mound
Park "with its attendant evils of pool
selling-and other forms of gambling to be
a diserace to Alameda County." Rev.
Dr. AloVse, Rev. S. C. Keetca and Rev. C.
M. Hill were appointed a committee to in
vestigate-and find out if anything could
be done to abate the evil.
Two papers were read, the first by Rev.
Dr. VVilKin.<, on -'Home and Bible Study
Culture," and the second by Rev. Dr. H.
C. Woods, superintendent of the Baptist
missionary board. Dr. Woods gave a mis
sionary lecture, illustrated by maps.

discussed the question of the method of
inspiration. Iv the general expression of

A COWARDLY ATTACK.
Reputable Citizens Tricked lato
Aspersing Sig Bett
man's Record.
Manly Letter cf Exphn tion F.om
Rhodes Bord.n â B-ttman's
Friends Also Duped.
A political trick has just been played
with the intention of injuring the candi
dacy of Sig Bettman, regular Republican
nominee for the Assembly in the Fortieth
District, that wouid do honor to the brains
of a Buckley or the paunch of a Rainey.
It is belisved that the scheme originated
in the Sheriff's office, where Mr. Bettman
is havin . an active fight made against
him on account of his antipathy to the re
pealing of the fee bill, estimated to save
the tixnayers of this municipality about
$20,000 a year. I
The way the job was worked was in this
wise: A few dayÃ ago a document was
prepared eulogizing L. M. Manzer, the
Democratic nominee for the Assembly
from the Fortieth. The names of several
influential citizens were then secured to
this paper.
Wdat was the surprise and bewilder
ment when a circular of two pages was
issued and a-siduously circulated in the
district, bearing on one side the signed
summary of Mr. Manzer's virtues ani on
the other a rabid attack on Mr. Bettman's
attitude on several street-railway propo
sitions. Not only was this addition an
arrant misrepresentation, but the method
of arrangement of the circular was such
as to convey the idea that the signers not
only indorsed tbe statements in regard to
Manzer's record and character but the
attack on bettman.
R odes Bortien, one of the signers, at
once addresse i an open letter to Bettman
deprecating tbe trick played on himself.
He said that while he had signed the in
dorsement of iJettrnau be had no idea a
page would be added attacking a man
w.th whom he had not even a passing
acquaintance, and with whose record he
was totally unacquainted.
Friends of Bettman yesterday issued a
dodger wholly and forcibly justifying his
action ia recard to tbe street railway
proposition and showing him to be on the
side of right and the people. The follow
ing gentlemen who were duped into sign
ing the mass cf representations against
Mr. Bettman are warm political support
ers of his in this campaign: M. Gold
water, 1320 Sutter street; J. E nsiein, 14"-3
Franklin; A. Leszinsky, 1116 Bush; T. F.
Brady, 2301 Pine; 8. Hoffman, 1612 Geary.
No rignt-rainded man will let this politi
cal dodge prejudice him against Mr. Bett
man, but, on the contrary, he has gained
many friends by it.
The election of McK.nley and Hobart
will bring about a quicker restoration
of confidence, freer money for the peo
ple and a quicker prosperity.
GOLD DEMOCRATS.
Big: Tote Will Be Cast for Palmer and
Buckuer To-Day.
The sound-money Democrats of Cali
fornia, who are supporting Palmer and
Buckner for President and Vice-Preside nt,
are feeling much encouraged over the
prospects of their ticket in California.
The electors nominated by this wing of
the Democratic party, known on the
official ballot as National Democrats, com
prise some of the best known and most
highly respected members of the Demo
cratic party, and when they call tne roll
of the rank and file of their organization
it is found to bÂ« composed of representa
tive men througnont the State.
No better illustration of this fact could
be found than in the way in which they
responded to a request for funds with
which to defray the necessary expenses of
the campaign. The contributions came
in so freely that the committee was com
pelled to call a nalt in order to obviate the
embarrassment of a surplus.
In contrast with thin was the predica
ment of the so-called Regular Democratic
State Committee that has been cramped
for means from the brginnine of the cam
paign. If it had not been for the assist
ance of the sack nrodueed by the silver
advocates the Democratic State Committee
would have cut a sorry figure in the cam
pnign just rlogf-d.

THE COAL TRADE.
The private circular of I. Stetiart gives the re
ceipts of coal at this port thus far this year at
1,057,000 tons, acainst 1,137.500 tons during tbe
.same period in 1895, and says: "The arrivals of
Australian coal during the month have been free
and will continue in good supply for some time to
come, while quotations for future loading of coal
from there are atili pressed, although at slightly
higher figures than have lately been ruling. The
sii'pmems of anthracite coa' fr m Great Britain
bave almost entirely ceased for the present, on
account of extreme rates of freight being asked by
Kiiips to load tor this port."
NO BUSINESS TO-DAY.
To-day being flection-day, business will be
completely suspended throughout the City.
Explanation.
Tbe arrow flies with the wind. The top figures
at station indicate maximum temperature for tbe
days: those underneath it. if any, the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and himdredtlis,
during tbe past twelve hours. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect poln s of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hieh" means hi?h barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is uÂ»ually preceded
and accompanied by elondy weather and rains.
"Lows" us' ally first appear on the Washington
coast. Wbn the pressure is high in the Interior
and low along the coasr, and the Isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain'is probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with isobars of
niarked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California* coas'. warmef
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather in winter. The reverse of these condition*
will produce an opposite result.

KFW YORK. N. V., Nov. 2.â Stocks .to-day'
were s'rong from start to finish. Money on call
was difficult to obtain, although banks did not re
fuse anybody with good collateral willing to pay
14 per cent and Interest. At one time the rate
touched i/i per cent and interest, which it equal to
98 per cent per an num. The closing transaction
was at I/4 per cen and interest, sterling ex
change strong. Posted rates were put up i/ 2 per
cent to 4 8-JVa and. 4 86, which is remarkable.
The strength ot s erllnp exch<iuge was due to the
indlsposi ion of bankers to draw until the result
of to-morrow's election is known. - A rise in
bent of nearly 2 cents stimulated purchases of
the Western railway Issues. â  Governments also
appreciated 1 Â£Â©11/3 per cent and this added to the
bullish feeling.

time were possessed of much strength. Again

Dr. Mott and the Ball.
They tell a fnnny story of Dr. Mott,
chairman of th* silver party in North Car
olina. It is related that on one occasion, in
a lonely field in his native State, he met a
bull of the most ferocious kind, a ball
with a record of casualties as long as a
"Pop" platform. The bull charged at
once, and in deadly style. Dr. Mott
gazed into those inflamed taurine orbs
with his own ineffauly sad and gentle
eyes. "Friend," 1 c said to ihe bull, "be
fore you go any further I wish to give
you my views on the crime of 1873." The
bull gazed into those earnest, eyes, began
to weep bitterly, ran away at lull speed to
Raiei^h and then committed suicide in a
china shop.â Elgin News.

â¢ Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Nov. 2. , $
' < Oakland was on tire to-night.
A man in a balloon would have thought
that the citizens of this county bad de
cided to sacrifice their chief city to the
torch and cannon. . There was fire on
every corner, fire from many housetops,
fire from thousands of torches, fire from
myriads of roman candles, fire from hun
dreds of soaring skyrockets, fire from doz
ens of flaming wagons.
: . But nowhere could be seen the fire of
* anarchy. Amid all the blaze there was
i not a single torch of an incendiary, but
I the fiercest fire that burned was that of
A enthusiastic, genuine Republicanism, it
. \pas the eruption of the volcano that has
been restrained for weeks, . pending the
arrival of the eve of election. It was the
"outpouring of the convictions of a multi
tude of honest men who regard patriotism
as superior to party and National integ
rity' as of more value than personal ag
grandizement.
Although, under the auspices of the Re
publicans, it could not in strict truth be
called a Republican demonstration. It
was most definitely a parade significant of
honor, honesty, National pride, intelli
gence and manhood. - Throughout its
whole length there - was not a feature or
even a suggestion of which any American
might not feel proud. No attempt was made
to ridicule or to belittle the opinions of
those who were opposed to the spirit, of
the demonstration, but instead the spirit
of genuine fair play pervaded every divi
sion.
If a vestige of "coercion" had any place
in that parade, then the world mast find
a new name for hypocrisy. The thousands
of men in line were men of intelligence
and Integrity. The majority were work
men, plain, ordinary, honest workmen,
and they walked with the step : of pride,
knowing full well that they are the: back
bone of a ' commonwealth and -* that on
their shoulders in reality rests the burden
of sustaining the honor of their Nation.
Puerile and narrow-minded indeed
must have been the observer that could
misinterpret the spirit of that ", crowd.
MBflt of them were men to whom the
Â»*nd of the anvil and the burr of the
saW is the most harmonious music, rep
respiting as it does the connecting link
between home and possible happiness.
They were ; men with horny . bands and
hard headsâ men capable of thinking for
themselves. They were not the men that
have been seen .bowling and ranting on
1 the. street corners of Oakland for the past
six months. : They w*re not the men who
could devise Ino more intelligent a cam
paign badge than a vile caricature of Mr.

Hnnna. They were not the men who
talk of torches ana dynamite in as fa
miliar a manner as a workingman speaks
of bis tools.
Tne whole of the eleven divisions were
domnated by the spirit of '76, and it is no
exaggeration to say that the majority of
those in line regard the advent ot Bryan
ism as a menace no less dangerous than
that which confronted the Republic in the
year of its birth.
The whole day was given up to Repub
licanism. It was Alameda County Me-
Kihlev day. Enthusiasm seemed to burst
over the country simultaneously with the
bursting of the sunshine through the
misly clouds that hung over the bay cities
in the early morning. Long before noon
it was seen that Oakland had decided to
make the day a general holiday. The
business houses were open as usual, but
no business was done. Those employing
clerks early saw that it was to be a day on
which the great issue before tbe Nation
was to be considered paramount to every
thing else and acted accordingly.
On the sidewalks were thousands of
people wearing bright yellow McKinley
badges, and several times during the day
the supp.y was totally inadequate for the
demand at the parade headquarters. All
tbe yellow ribbon in town was bought up
and still there was none left to give four
inches apiece to everybody that wanted to
be in the parade.
Although the largest crowds naturally
gathered in tbe center of tbe city, the en
thusiasm was not confined to Broadway.
It reached into the adjacent cities, the
suburos, the outlying tow s, the distant '
hamlets and the isolated ranches in tbe
mogt remote parts of the county. Toward
noon it verily seemed as if all roads led to
Oakland. Notwithstanding the fact that
many thousands went to the racetrack in
the middle of theday to hear Hon. Thomas
B. Reed, the crowd in the center of tbe
city was not appreciably diminished.
They gathered from every quarter, and
Oakland never looked so lively as it has
done throughout the day.
it was a good day for peddlers of cam
paign paraphernalia. McKinley sticks
with heads of the next Pr sident suffi
ciently large and heavy to justify an arrest
for carrying a deadly weapon were numer
ous; McKinley dollars big as cartwheels;
McKinley bad ires, bright as the sun that
shone upon them; McKinley buttons,
McKinley hats, McKinley pins; little
black coffins, into which the vendor
politely suggested that the purchaser
might have the pleasure of placing Bryan
next Wednesday, were also offered. These
were all for sale, and the little fellows ap
peared to reap a golden harvest. But
without doubt the most beautiful emblem
seen, and which was worn by men and
women alike, and which was fittingly
selected as the only decoration In connec
tion with the National colors for adorning
the carriage in which Mr. Reed was driven
through tbe streets, was the golden chrys
anthemum. 80 great was the demand for
them that a curly-headed specimen
which under ordinary circumstances is
well paid for with a nickel was to-day
worth three Units that amount.
After all, the preparation for the demon
stration would have looked dull and faded
and the hops ol all those who had worKed
so hard to insure success would have been
somewhat downcast had not nature her
self decided to i.onor the day. From tbe
moment that the brilliant son, which
somehow seemed to shea more golden
rays than usual, decided to dispel the
leaden mantle that overhung the city un
til the time when she disappeared below
tbe western horizon not a little speck of
cloud was to bÂ« seen in tbe brightest of
blue skies. Her disappearance, however,
was not the signal of darkness, for before
her light was entirely withdrawn initial
features of the great demonstration were
in evidence, and for several hours the im
pression was created that the day had
been carried without intermission to the
very dawn of tbe morning on which the
great battle was to be finally decided.
The parade occupied one hour and
twenty-five minutes in passing a given
point, and was not discharged till nearly
midnight.
One of the features of the parade was
the laree locomotive float sent by the Oak
land Iron Works. It was built on two
wagons, and was followed by a very en
thusiastic line of railroad men.
The only inharmonious feature of the
parade was the attempt of a few Populists
to create disorder at Eighth and Broad
way as the various divisions were dis
banding. The Populist Zouaves, about
twenty in number, tried to march through
the procession. Many of them were m

toxicated and it was very plain that their
purpose was to create trouble, if possible.
One young fe;low was bundled out of
line oy a police officer, and, becoming con
vinced that they would not be allowed to
break; the RepuDlican lines, the Populists
turned tail and retreated by the way they
came.
At the conclusion of tbe demonstration
the Alliance* entertained the Plumed
Knights of San Francisco at a banquet.
THE LEADING FEATURE.
The head of the parade was a piece of
artillery drawn by tonr sturdy horses and !
beautifully decorated. On the cannon j
was seated not a gunner with ball in hand,
but a pretty little girl in white, represent- â 
ing peace. A steam whistle, such as is
heard in the early morn when factories are
in rnnning, followed. Then came what I
appeared to be a section of pandemo
nium. Its details could not be seen until
the smoke and sulphur had cleared away, j
when two wagons appeared, in each of^
which was a cauldron containing; red tire,
which was never allowed to grow dim,
and from each corner of eit.'.er wagon a
continuous stream of lockets shot into
the air.
At a distance in the rear sufficient to
guarantee protection from asphyxiation,
was a platoon of police. Grand Marshal
V. W. Ga-kill, Chiet of Staff We bo N.
Pierce and Chief Aid Cal Ewing headed
the battalion of aids, composed of Frank
H. Mason, E. W. Roberts Jr., D. C. Brown,
Daniel Doody, Fred Boquet, J. Slavich. A.
W. Pattiani, J. W. Harris. E. R. Pearch,
A. M. Baerott, Victor Rembel. Henry
Watkinson, R. S. Tichenor, William Mc-
Donald and A. D. Benham.
HISTORY IN FLOATS.
Considering the many divisions and the
consequent difficulty of bringing them into
line, the big procession started in a man
ner that reflected great credit on those
who had it in charge. For one hour pre
vious to the start Grand Marshal Varney
Gaskiii, gorgeous in pold sash and tinsel
and mount d on an enthusiastic horse,
could be seen galloping through the vari
ous divisions issuing his orders in that
stentorian voice which seems inseparable
from tbe Republican Alliance, of which
he is commander. The first division might
be called a historical lesson in floats.
Captain W. R. Thomas was the marshal
and Veterans C. H. Grey, E. W- Wood
ward and H. W. Richardson were his
aids. After them came a band piayin^
military music, then a beautifully deco
rated carriage containing General Fred
ericks, commander-in-chief of the Army
and Navy League, and tbe white-haired
Colonel McElroy, commander of the Oak
land Camp. A nuge float, on which were
seated in tiers forty-five young ladies,
represented the Union. Each carried a
Jitt/a flag and wore a sash on which ap
peared the name of a State.
A mounted cannon, surrounded by sev
eral ex-soldiers in unilorm, with some of
the relics of battle strewn at their feet,
was the next float Following it were two
floats representing battle-fields. Disabled
veterans were lying arou-nd, evidences of
ruin were plentiful and the whole con
veyed a very clear lesson of the horror of
warfare. Members of the Alameda and
Berkeley camps in uniform and carrying
torches brought the division to a close.
LOCAL INDUSTRY FLOATS.
Colonel J. S. White was marshal of tbe
second division. His aids, W. A. Mitchell
and Dr. J. M. Dunn, followed him at the
head of a band. That popular organiza
tion which came into existence a few
months ago, the Young Men's Republican
League, followed and immediately after
ward came hundreds of citizens, wearing
badges and carrying torches.
A beautiful creation in borax, drawn by
four white horses, represented that in
dustry. Fall representations of the Third,
Fifth and Seventh Ward Republican clubs
were next in line, followed closely by A.
A. Moore ana party in a four-borse drag.
Tbe final feature of this division was a
large float representing the product" of the
cotton-mills, and immediately behind it
were 250 employes of that concern, each
wearing a suitable emblem.
ALAMEOA'S SHOWING.
The third division was in charge of Mar
shal D. V. Martin of Alameda, who was
assisted by M. W. Dunton and J. J. Lerri.
After them came a martial band. The
pretty Alameda Drill Corps, the Alameda
Regular Republican Club, the Alameda
Republican Club and the Aiameda Veteran
Republican Clnb, each mustering a large
turnout, were followed by a large float
representing the terra cotta industry of
tbeir city.
IRON MEN IN LINE.
A cannon that frequently belched forth
a thunderous warning headed the fourth
division, winch was in command of Mar
shal Charles Mautalen, who was assisted
by H. Bercovich, William Watkinson,
Albert Kayser ami W. D. Heitman. Fol
lowing a lively drum corps tame the
Forty-eighth Assembly Drill Corps, the
First Ward Repubhcan Club, the Fourth
Ward McKinley and Hobart Club, the
Fourth Ward Republican Club and the
i S.xth Ward Republican Club. The floats
I in this division represented the iron indus
try. Two were from the Oakland Iron
1 Works and the same number from the
I Judson Company. After the floats were
I 160 sturdy iron-workers.
SAN FRANCISCO'S PART.
The big City across the Bay fleured in
Uthe fifth division. Marshal George H.
f Mason and Aid P. L. Koscialowski and
Dr. R. H. Allen preceded the band of the
Thirty-fifih Assembly Club. That beauti
ful organization, Plumed Knights of San
Francisco, followed. After them came the
Bear Club of that City, then the Phcsnix
Drill Corps from across the Bay.
A large representation of the National
Republican League of San Francisco was
followed by two patriotic floats sent over
by the Union League.
MAYOR KELLER'S PRIDE.
Mayor P. J. Keller of Piedmont was
marshal of the sixth division. J. A. Bliss
and H. A. Weitzel, Oakland's humane
poundmaster, helped him to preserve the
regularity of his command. The division
consisted of a mounted cavalcade of about
200. Marshal Keller had recruited the di
visioh from Piedmont and Oakland Town
ships, and it was without doubt tbe live
liest section of the parade. The marshal's
horse was ornamented with a large green
wreath, and his uniform became his sta
tion. Each of the cavalcaders wore a sash
and helmet and their horses were liberally
decorated with Piedmont chrysanthe
mums. The rattle of the horses' hoofs
was completely drowned by the cheering
that the cavalcade called forth. This was
the only division without a band, and in
deed one would have been entirely wasted.
THESE DEMAND PROTECTION.
Tbe seventh division was in charge of
Marshal J. F. Hayes, whose aids
were J. W. Dewey, J. T. Vaughn, I. L.
Cavasso, F. D. Cusbing, H. N. Gard, M. F.
Bosworth and T. J. Fish.
This was the great industrial division.
Dozens of merchants and hundreds of
employes marched side by side. Several
floats represented the brick industry ; ail
the large express companies had decorated
teams in line; flour and wheat, with a
transparency having a reference to silver,
were on another float; twelve teams rep
resented the lumber industry; a float and
forty men were sent by the door-makers;
several wagons and many men were there
from the coalyards; tbe canning compa
nies had a four-horse team and several
men in line; refrigerators, coal oil, wine,
upholstering, hardware, toys, produce,
water, shoes and paints were all attended
to in such a manner as to convey the im
pression that if their respective industries
were not protected from cheap foreign
competition there would soon be thou
sands more of unhappy homes than are
now to be found in this State.
Interspersed between the many floats of
this division were wagons of red fire that
illuminated the determined features of tbe
hundreds of men who realized that they
were parading not for tbe benefit of sight
seers, but for liberty and home.
SOUND MONEY LEAGUE.
Marshal Don F. Miller commanded the
eighth division. W. Mackev, A. H.
Trathur, A. M. Benham, Ben Ferris and
C. K. King were bis assistants. Tbe
proud alliance followed the band. Their
handsome uniforms were refurbished for
tbe final effort in the campaign; their sil
ver-plated torches reflected the flame that
issued from them, and gave each man the
â appearance of being on fire below the
shoulders, at tbe same time making each
torch produce the effeot of two. The Al
liance acted as escort to what might al
most be considered a Democratic com
pany. But it was not. It was the sound
money league of Oakland, and although it
contained many of the men who have
been the foundatibn of the Alameda
County Democracy of the past, it con
Children Cry for Pitcher's Castoria.
tained no one who will place a little red
cross after the name of Mr. Bryan to-mor
row.
Representations of tbe real estate and
insurance companies followed and with
them the bar of Alameda County. After a
drum corps was tbe Afro- American
League. They turned out strongly and
made a splendid showing, carrying a
transparency expressive of gratitude 10
army and navy veterans.
NATIONAL REPUBLICAN LEAGUE
As hundreds of citizens felt in duty
bound to take part in this parrde who
were not affiliated with any regular Re
publican organization the ninth division
was reserved for them. Marshal George
C. Hunt, wiih Abe P. Leech and W. H.
Friend as aids, headed the division with
a band. Then came tbe National Repub
lican League. It consisted of hundreds of
the best-known Republicans in. this
county, together with a large number of
unattached citizens. They extended for
over two blocks and were followed by a
full attendance of the Second Ward Re
publican Club. A float representing the
wood industry ended this division.
FROM THE INTERIOR.
The tenth division was largely com
posed of Republican clubs and kindred
organizations from the interior of tbe
county. It was marshaled by T. W.
Jeffries and his assistants, George W. An
derson and Alex Macadam. It was led by
a band, followed by the Temesoal Drill
Corps. Then came an interesting body of
men. It was the Railroad Men's Repub
lican Club. If any refutation of the
charge of "coercion were needed one
look at the faces of this clnb would surely
dispel it from the mind of any one not a
lunat.c or incapable of observation. Fol
lowing them was a float containing arti
sans, each representing a different trade.
A piece of artillery was followed by a
drum corps, heading the Regular Repub
lican Italian Club.
Republicans from Niles and Mount
Eden marched to the music of the Liberty
band. Next in line were the Republican
organizations from Livermore, San Lo
renzo, Haywards, Pieasanton, San Lean
dro, Newark, Centerville, Mission San
Jose, Fruitvale, the whole terminating
with the Young Men's Republican Club
ot Brooklyn Tow nship.
U. C. MEN IN LINE.
Berkeley figured largely in the eleventh
division, which was officered by Marshal
J. A. D. Hutton, with his aid-de-corps of
W. A. Waitebury, George H. Phillips, A.
Smith and James Kearney.
The University Republican Club of
Berkeley came after the band. A good
deal has beefi said of this club and much
was expected from it. It certainly ful
filled all expectations and the cheering
with which it waÂ« received proved that
tde spectators were proud to see their
State school of learning turn out such a
fine body of young Republicans.
The Young Men's Republican Club of
Berkeley and the regular clubs of Berke
ley and West Berkeley were followed by
the McKinley League, the Golden Gate
McKinky Club, Lorin McKinley Club and
the Bay District Republican Club.
The last feature in the parade presented
a strong contrast to the generally insig
nificant feature that characterises street
marches. Following the last political
club was a battalion of pupils from the
Oakland High School, each of whom was
armed with the latest patented ten-lung
power fish horn. And they used them as
only O. H. 8. boys can. Immediately in
their rear was a cannon, which was con
tinually being loaded with blank car
tridges as fast as tbe muzzle was cool
enough to receive them.
ALONG THE MARCH.
Such were tbe details of Alameda
County's great Republican demonstration.
But they fail to convey a just impression
of what that demonstration consisted.
While tbe eye was divided between watcn
ine the fire on the streets and the burst
ing of the myriads of rockets overhead,
the ear was deafened by the frequent dis
charge of artillery, the tooting of horns,
the rattling of drum corps the music of a
score of bands, the clattering of number
less hoofs upon tbe pavement, the rum
bling of countless wheels, the yelling and
cheering; from what almost seemed to be
the population of the county, the snort
ing of steam whistles and the occasional
clanging of a Dell, while the only surges
tiun of peace and quietness came from far

overhead where the stars defied the efforts

Even during the night, as during the
day, nature herself seemed anxious to
show her approval of the great outpour
ine of Republicanism. A3 tne head of,

the darkness of Jackson street with its

Midnight came, but it did not mark the
end of Alameda County's efforts .to pro

After that hour a few stray rockets could
be seen- shooting into the air, a few dis

where candidates were receiving the final

that were conveying back to their tomes

It was well toward morning before quiet

HOW TO COUNT THE BALLOT.
" District Attorney Snook Gives an
Opinion Regarding the Popocratic
Presidential Electors.
Oakland Office San Francisco Cali^)
908 Broadway, Not. 1. )
The usual kind of eleventn-hour circular
intended to hurt the chances of certain
candidates was issued yesterday and to
day, but the interest in the parade ol to
night was so great that hardly any
thought has been given to to-morrow's
doings.
The Republicans express confidence that
the entire party ticuet will be elected, and
while making conservative estimates of
the majority they think McKinley's vote
will not give less than 3000 plurality.
At this morning's meeting of the Super
visors a resolution was passed allowing two
representatives of the Alameda County
Tolitical Equality Society to be present at
each polling place while the votes were
being canvassed.
Regarding a possible conflict of opinion
amone officers of election boards over the
count of the Populist and Democratic
electors District Attorney Snook to-day
submitted an opinion, in which he says
the votes for Democratic electors and
Populist electors should be tallied separ
ately, but in the returns each elector
should be given his total vote â in the case
of ihe Democratic and Populist electors
the sum of the votes under both designa
tions. When there are more than nine
electors voted for, or if an elector be voted
for twice under different party names,
Mr. SnooK advisos that the ballot be not
counted as to any electors.
The Republican county and legislative
ticket is as follows:
Superior Judgeâ W. E. Greene and 8. P.
Han.
Justice of Peaceâ J. W. Stetson and J. J.
Allen.

Mrs. Ida A. Harper, chairman of the
State press committee of the Political
Equality Campaigners, issued the follow
ing manifesto to-night, wh:ch she says ap
plies equally to the irta'.e at large:
To-dpy the women of Alameda County close
their campaign. For eight long months they
have worked harder than any pen can de-
scribe to obtain the suffrage for themselves.
No man in California ever put forth an effort
for his suffrage; it was his without tne askine.
The work in this county has been in the
hands of its most representative women. The
same is true of Â»11 the counties in the State, j
They have conducted a womanly, dignified
campaign, on tne highest possible plane.
They have identified themselves witn no polit
ical organizations, but have been strictly non
partisan and non sectarian.
They have made no deals, bargains or
pledges. Not one woman has been actuated
by any motive of personal gain, but only by
the strongest desire to obtain the franchise
for all women to use according to their own
convictions.
Now we submit our caae. to the men of the
county. Not one woman can vote for her own
freedom. We appeal to the men to reward
hard work by voting "Yes" -on the sixth
amendment. If they cannot do this, then we
beg of them not to vote at all on this amend
ment, which takes no right from any man, but
only gran's to women equal rights under the
Constitution.

COLLEGE AG AINST CLUB,
Berkeley and Reliance Will
Meet To-Day in a Football
Match.
It Will Be Their Last Game of the
Season Together â CDhegians
Confident.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 2â Much in
terest is centered in the outcome of the
Berkeley-Reliance football game, which
will take place to-morrow afternoon at 3
o'clock in Central Park, San Francisco. It
will be the second and last regular game
between the two teams this season, and
that it will be an interesting and hotly
contested one t here seems to be no doub 1 .
Both teams are in tine condition, and both
will take their positions on the gridiron
determined to win. In their last game
together Reliance defeated Berkeley
handily, but the college menÂ£ seem ile
termined to even matters np this time.
Though Hutchinson and Sherman, two of
the Varsity players, will not be able to
enter the game to-morrow afternoon, the
men who have beer, doing creditable sub
stitute work will take their places at end
and half.
In the last game with the Reliances
Berkeley's line was the most vulnerable
point, and it was through the center and
tackles of the college team that the club
men made most of their gains. Berkeley's
bacKs were stronger at that time than the
Reliance and it was upon their rushing
and dodging that the collet-Mans depended
for their gains, but whenever the Reliance
took the ball they made their advance by
heavy line bucking ana by pounding the
center.
Matters will probably be more equalized
to-mortow. With a stronger line than in
the last game, with just as potificient
backs and with more ginger than ever,
Berkeley expects to carry of? the oa m of
victory to-morrovr. They don't expect to
gain the day, however, by any easy work
or by any very great margin.
Tne line-up of the collegians will be as
follows: Center. Birdsall; guards, Ludlow
and Greisberg; tackles, Simpson and
A very, with Carr and Peck substitutes;
ends, Craig and McNutt, with Hooper as
substitute; quarter, Kennedy, with Has
kell alternate; halves, Hall and Anderson,
with Whipple as substitute: full. Captain
Ransome. The Reliance will line up with
Burnett, center; Oliver and Wei. 8. guards;
Middiemas and feexton, tackles; Lacuna

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1596.
THE TRUE FACTS
AND THE COURT RECORDS
Regarding Judge Hebbard's Con
nection With the People's
Home Savings Bank.
Because tne friends of Ju'lge Hebbard real
ize that the election law and his lack of means
prevent the Judge from doing so, they submit
to the public through the advertising columns
of the press the following statement of Judge
Hebbard's connection with the People's Home
Savings Bank litigation:
On the first day of May, 1894. while I was
presiding Judge of the Superior Court at Sun
Francisco, W. H H. Hart Esq., then Attorney-
General of the Slate of California, entered my
chambers und presented a complaint agtiinst
the People's Home Savings Bark, praying to
have tne bank declared insolvent under tbe
banking act of this State. At the same time
he represented to me the extreme necessity for
appointing a receiver to preserve the assets of
the bank until its affairscould be rescued lrom
the chaotic condition in which they then were.
Thereupon I said to General Hart: "I shall
appoint General John F. Sheehan in this case,
because I believe him to be trustworthy and
capable and possessed of exceptional execu
tive ability." To which General Hart replied:
"I know General Kheehan; it is all right."
On May 1, the very day on which General
Hart tiled his complaint, General Sheetiiin
qualified as receiver and gave bonds in the
sum oi $100,000. It being necessary for the
receiver to employ an attorney, General Sbee
han emp.oyed James Alva Watt as such at
torney.
That night General Sheeh&n, as receiver,
after great difficulty, forced his way into the
offire of the People's Home Savings Bank. A
short time before the receiver effected his
entrance $2500 was paid to the former attor
neys of the old board of directors from the
money on hand at the bank, as payment in
advance for services, lenving tne sum ofoniy
$4 35 in the bank vaults. At that time the
banking act of the State as amended was new
and had never been construed by the Supreme
Court. There was doubt whether a receiver
could be uppointed in an action brought by
the Attorney-General, and in view of that
doubt, I inormed General Sheehan from tbe
outset that he might never become entitled to
any compensation for his services. General
Sheehau accei>ted|the appointment with that
understanding.
On June 11, 1894, the Supreme Court of the
State rendered au opinion, deciding that tbe
appointment of a receiver was improperly
made in tlie suit brought by the Attorney-Gen
ernl, but further stating expressly thai cred
itors ana 6tocknoiders ol hanking corpoia
tions were not without a remedy, although
the banking act provided none, becausa an ac
tion in equity might be maintained in a proper
case to afford ail requisite relief. (See 109 Cal.
Reports, page 34.) Antic paling '.his sugges
tion, an action iv equity of the p:operscppe,
entitled "Natlian Goldtree vs. The People's
Home Savings Bank and other defendants."
had been commenced on May 31, 1894. On
June 25, 1894, and in compliance with me ex
press suggestion of the Supreme Court above
stated, General Sheehan was appointed re
ceiver in the equity action.
Before doing so, however, 1 went to the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of
California and consulted with him. During a
portion of that interview Justice Van Fleet
and Justice Garoutte were present. I said
to Chiei Justice Beatty: "1 do not know how
you gentlemen are going to finally pass uj mi
my arts in relation to a leteiver in ihis bank
muddle, and I have not come to talk to you
about the law oi the case. lam going to ap
point a receiver in an equity ca?e, and I have
come to say to you that whatever I do in the
court below I do without any intention of be
ing contemptuous of tiiis court. I have a fact
to grapple with; I must do all in my power,
lawfu ly, to protect and save to the depositors
who have been robbed what there is left of
the assets of the People's Home Savings
Bank." Whereupon Chief Justice Beatty said:
'â¢Judge, we know what you are doing; go
rig t ahead."
The su|,r..-me Court, in theirdecision of June
11, 1894, held that where a bank is in an ln
t>olvÂ«.-ni condition and it is unsafe for it longer
to continue In business, the Attorney-General
shall commence an action la the name of the
people of the Suite. That if a decree i.c made
by ihe d.urt declaring the bank insolvent,
that thereafter it s'ia 11 go into the hands of
the board of directors for liquidation under
the supervision of the Bunk Commissioners
WheD such a dcc.cc hns been made tlie court
has absolutely nothing further to do with the
affairs of the insolvent bank. Even beiore :hat
opinion was rendered I was so very careful ot
the interests of the depus.tors and anxious
that they should have representation upon
the board of directors that I permuted them,
through their attorneys, to come into court
an'l endeavor to organize a new board of di
rectors with their proper representatives as
member*. On ihe2sth day o! January, 1895,
Thomas S. Wiliiems Jr., one of said depositors,
wrote the following letter to me, recognizing
my efforts in tne premises:

ing representation on the Board of Directors.
I have Informed members of our committee of
the efforts you have made In our behalf and
whicb were in a fair way to be realized until
my interview yesterday mornineuub Rollo
V. Wati, who now objects to my going on the
board. I have no prejudice, as he claims, nor
have 1 any desire to be a director, but ihe com
mittee representing depositors desire repre
sentation and earnestly look to you in simple
justice to them to use your influence with
.Messrs. Sheehan and Watt to that end. The
time is short and I trust that you can take im
mediate action to bring about our request.
Thanking you in advance, I am with respect
yours very truly Thomas s. Williams ,Ib.,
Acting for Executive Cuinniit.ee.
A day or two after that and following almost
on the heels of the letter Mr. Thomas S. Wi.
lianis Jr. and Mr. Bartnett of the law firm of
Gunnison, Booth <t Barrett, the attorneys, ior
the California Bate Deposit an<i Trust "com
pany, came to my cnambers. Both gentlemen
enrnestly r. que-ted me to use mv personal in
fluence to get them representa.ion upon the
board of directors about to be organized, f
said to Mr. Williams: "Mr. Whliams, with this
affair I have nothing to do judicially, but I
w.ll now leave my courtroom and chamber-, I
will go downtown and I will leaven > stone
unturned till 1 have obtained for your com
mittee, representing some of the depositors,
representation upon that boiird of directory.
And, Mr. Williams, ax you desire to be one of
that board I will endeavor to nave you se
lected as one, but I snail have difficulty in
getting you on the board as a director, because
lam informed s^me of the depositors do not
like you personal. y."
I then immediately went to the California
Safe Deposit and Trust Company to Genera!
Sheehan and to Mr. Watt. I also went toothers
who had influence with the stot-Khold. rs, and
within a thort time succeeded in getting
elected as n. embers of the board of directors
of the People's Home Savings Bank, in l.quida
tion, Thomas S. W.l.iains Jr. and two of nis as
sociates to represent the depositors of the
bank. Beiore doing this, however, i said to
Mr. Wtllinms: "Mr. Williams, if 1 succeed in
accomplishing this result I have one favor to
ask of you. Will you go among your peop.e
who have beeu made to believe that lam
working against their Uiterest and tt-il them
the truth?" and he said, "Judge Hebbard, I
will do so."
In January, 1896, the California Safe De
posit and Trust Company, tbe assiguee oi over
$700,000 in claims of depositors against the
bank, issued a printed report to the deposit
ors, in which they made a statement in terms
as follows: "'However, it soon became nppannt
tnut it would be Impossible to execute our
trust to tbe best interests of the depositors
without * representation upon the board of
directors of. the People's Home Sayings Bunk,
but we need not state here me vexatious liti
gation, trouble and woffc necessary to accom
plish that result. Suffice it to say that only
aiter the institution of four actions â one by
our com; any as piÂ«intiff and three by stock
holders, our attorneys acting in their bdiali â
a representation whs accorded the interests rep
resented by us. Judge Htbbard of our Superior
Court and Mr. Kilbuin of the Bank Commis
sion kindly interceded to accomplish this
result, and to give the depositors the repre
sentation to wnich ttiey were entitled, mor
ally if not legally. The result of their inter
cession and of tli is litigation was the retire
ment of certain members from the boara of
directors and tbe election In their stead of
John Coleman and J. C. Johnson (both mem
bers of the directory of our institution) and
T. 8. Williams. Subsequently another va
cancy was created in tne board, wbicn was
filled by the election of George Davidson."
I never ord red or authorized the payment
of a single cent of money to either General
Sheehan or James Alva Watt for their services.
Whatever compensation they received was
paid to them without my intervention, sanc
tion, concurrence, order or knowledge, by the
directors of the bank in liquidation under
supervision of the B .nk Commissioners of the
State of California, acting independently of
any Judge, court or other authority.
I had nothing whatever to do with the al
leged expenditure of the sum of $42.895 41,
and know nothinic of it.
The foregoing facts are fully shown by the
records of the Snperlor and Supreme courts,
and the letters and papers in my posses-ion.
During the time that depositors were assign
ing their claims against the bank to the call
fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company many
of them came to my chambers to ask m\r pri
vate opinion of the character and standing of
that company, and of the advisability of as
signing their cairns to that instituiion. In
every instance, without hesitation, I advised
them to do so, saying tha- I btlleved that in
assigning their claims to the California Safe
Depo it and Trust Company they were putting
them into the hands ol an honest and repu
table institution which would act solely and
entirely in their interests.
The foregoing statements of fact, of law and
oi setif.ment are absolutely true. The lecling
which I have regarding the grossly unjust at
tack which has been made upon me in connec
tion with this bank is akin to that of an inno
cent man accused 01 a crime which he never
committed and condemned to incarceration
in prison lor the reM of his life.
For over tw6 years. I have endnred'thls li
belous injustice. The time hus obme when for
myself, for my family, my friends and the
community in which I live such injustice
must be siopped. I have no revense'.ul feel*
ing against the individual or individuals who
liave done me this wrong. Recently a libeious
circular was tent to over 70,000 people of Sau
FraLcisco, a circular whuh you have all
seen, ana copu-s of this publication were
also pent to my wife and relatives. I
then felt that as a citizen it was my duty
to invoke the law of this Siate regarding such
offenses, and thereupon caused witnesses and
evidence to be brought before the Grand Jury
to show who were the perpetrators of this
crime. Within forty-eight hours after the first
issuance of that circular the men whose
names were thereto subscribed as a deposit
ors'committee of thÂ» People's Home Savings
Bank were indicted for criminal libel. The
time before the election was too short to try
the case, but just as soon as the machinery of
the courts can be put in operation those seven
men will be prosecuted to the end. AH good
men and women love fairness and justice. If
some of the depositors of this bank have be
lieved or have been made to believe that I
have- been unfair in this matter let them mate
themselves conversant with the true facts
and with my true attitude toward them and
their Interests. I shall be content to abide
the result oi any fair investigation of the is
sue upon the merits. Respectfully,
J. <J. B. Hebbard.
Protection to American industries is
protection to the pockets of the people.
It means better gouda and more money
with which to buy them.

WIFE-BEATER S PUNISHED
Three Are Sent to the County Jail for
Six Months Ettch.
Three wife-beaters were sent to the
County jail for six months yesterday,
each by a different Judge.
A. J. Konklc is a bricklayer, and has a
wife and six children, the oldest 9 years
of age and the youngest only a few days.
He and his family lived in an annex to
the Fargo House, a cheap lodging-house
on New Montgomery street. Last Tues
day he was arrested -for cruelty to chil
dren. His wife bad a black eye and a
swollen lip through a beating he gave her
the ureviouÃ niuht. The wife and children
h:ive been cared for by the Society for the
Prevention of Crueitj to Children, and
yesterday Judge Campbell sent Konkle to
the County Jail for six months.
John Giblin is a furnisher and lived with
his wife and family at 428 Linden avenue.
July 16 last he was sent to the County
Jail for six months by Judpe Conian for
"six months for beating his wife. He was
so addicted to drink that he used to sell
his children's clothes and shoes to get
money to satiate his thirst. Saturday
morning he was released on bonds pend
ing an appeal to the Superior Court, and
he immediately celebrated his release by
getting drunk and going to his wife's
nouse to "rix her," as he had threatened
to do. The police were notified and
Giblin was arresiei. When his bondsmen
learned the facts they surrendered him
into custody, and yesterday morning
Judge Conian added a sentence of six
rLonths to lii-5 former sentence for being a
common drunÃanl anr 1 he was sent back
to the County Jail. His wife has applied
lor a divorce from him.
Robert Ztindel is a stevedore and lives
with his wife Lillie at 444% Third street.
Friday night she warned to go to the
theat-r with a lady friend and Zundel
objected. Sue insisted and he adminis
tered a sound thrashing to her. He was
arrested for battery and appeared before
Judge Low yesterday morning. The
J ti ige ask d Mrs Zundel if Zundel was
lucebsary to her support and sue replied
that she could live with her brother. The
Judge tnereupon sent Zundel to the
County Jail for six months.
Vole for C. K. bones t ell, Carroll Cook,
Jolio F. Finn and John Hunt for Supe
rior .linl;i'<. They are all men of un
doubted ability and unimpeachable
character.
Missing Since Friday.
F. W. Scheurich, a shoemaker, living at 8
Virginia court, has been missing since Oc
tober 30, and his- friends believe that he ha*
committed suicide. Yesterday Peter Uultin,
a tailor and incidentally the landlord of the
missing man, called Â«t the Morgue aud Bsked
if Scheuridi's body had beeji recovered. Upon
being informed that no such case had been

FAMOUS COLORED
SERVANTS TO GO
The Picturesque Force at
the Palace to Be Changed
for White Men.
Old Jerry, General Burnsides
and Other Noted Characters
to Step Out.
EXPECTED FOR SEVERAL DAYS
Many of Them There for Tears and
When Senator Sharon Opened
the Great Hotel.
The twenty-eight colored men, consti
tuting those on the various floors, in the
main office and at the doors of the Palace
Hotel, a number of whom have been with
the creat caravansary since it opened, win
go forth probably to-day to seek new
positions.
Their places have been filled by white
men from the Baldwin, California and
other hotels. The blue uniforms, span
gled with golden braid and gold and silver
buttons, have already been made for
them. The change has been on the cards
for some time.
It has been supnesed that it would take i
place on November 1, and several confer- j
ences were nad by some of the colored
men. as committees of the whole, with
Manager Kirkpatrick ann Assistant Man
ager Warren. They could, so they tell,
get no definite information about it till yes
terday, when it was admitted that the
change would take place.
Among the colored men are some
whose names are as weli known among
the wealthy and influential as any men,
white or black, in the City. Old Jerry,
otherwise Jerry Peterson, is one of these.
He has long carried cards to the ladies in
the parlor, and his white hair and long
white moustache have made him a strik
ing figure in the hotel. John Brodie, up
ob one of the upper floors, whose tremen
â¢ dous Dundreary whiskers have been re-
SDonsible for the pseudonym of General
Burn-ides, which has been thrust on him,
and Al Frazier are among the men.
Brodie came from New York, and has
â¢ been twenty-eight years at the hotel.
Jerry Peterson has been there twenty
eight years. He also came from New
"York. Al Frazier has been at the hotel
twenty-one years. He came from Kansas.
Then there is Charley Tinsley, Joseph
and Eb Saunders, John Randolph, James
Longstreet, George Mitchell and others
equally' well known. These and the
others are known to tens of thousands of
people over the globe, who have at one
â¢time or another been gueets at the Palace.
Some of the colored men have been in
the employ of famous men previous to
their coming here. Others served in the
great caravansaries of Boston, New York
Saratoga, Ciiicago, and St. Louis at one
time or another. Then Ralston, Sharon,
Senator Newton Booth and others, now
passed from these scenes, were at the
Palace. Some of these colored men waited
UDon them.

The of one of the colored men
yesterday was that for some time past ar
ticles had been missed from the rooms,
and that, without direct charges beirn,'
made, it had been decided to get a new
force.
"The guests are for us." he said, "but
that don't make any difference. You see,
there are a lot of skeleton keys in the dos
session of different people, and tliey go
and come as they please. The laun
dry-man has them; the housekeeper, of
course, as that is to be expected, and is all
riirht; the plumber, the locksmith and
others. Then there nave been some little
disagreements. So tne result is that we
are all to go. IdonM know what we will do.
None of us know. We expected we would
go on November 1, but we were not noti
fied, and now the general understanding
is that we won't go till after the election.
A notice has been put up that hereafter
all employes are to be paid by the day, so
we think it applies to our case. It was
settled to-day that the change is to take
place soon. The uniforms of the white
boys and men who are to succeed us have
been finished and ready for them for
several days."
Probably no colored men throughout
the Union are better known than those of
the Palace Hotel. At one time among
them was a very eloquent colored man,
who won celebrity as a speaker through
several political campaigns. The colored
men say they were getting |30 a month,
but that their successors get a little less, or
from $20 to $25.

AT THE CITY THEATERS.
Mrs. Taber Makes Her Appear
ance in Two Very Diverse
Roles.
A Good Performance of "Drifting
Apart" at thi Grandâ " Ten
nessee's Pardner."
Mrs. Julia Marlowe Taber showed her
remarkable versatility last night by ap
pearing in the one-act little tragedy of
"Chatterton" and afterward playing the
comedy role of Constance in "The Love
Chase."
"Ciiatterton" was not the version of the
poet's death which is associated with
vVilson Barrett's name. It is a day in
blank verse written by Ernest Lacy es
pecially for Mrs. Taber. She acted it with
intense earnestness and feeling, tne scene
where the starving poet tears up his be
loved manuscript before dying beine es
pecially touching. In spite of the boy's
dress, the boy's sentiments, however,
there was more of the woman than of the
I stripling in Mrs. Taber's emotion, and
j with all her still she interested more than
she convinced her audience.
"The Love Chase" was acted in a very
finished manner and the greatest atten
tion had been given to its staging. Mr.
and Mrs. Taber divided Honors for the
spiriteo way in wnicd they entered into
the comedy roles of Constance and Wild
rake. Their touch was feathery in its
lightnes?; Mr. Taber especially never bur
lesqued or was anything but natural,
though his attempts to play the man of
fashion aroused hearty laughter.
That clever comedian G. W. Anson
was excellent as Sir William Fondlove,
Bassett Roe was good as Master Waller,
Eugenia Woodward made a pathetic little
Lydia. and Mrs. Sol Smith's Widow
Green added considerably to the success
of the performance.
Grand Opera-Houae.
"Drifting Apart" at Morosco's is an even

and well divided drama, giving all the actors
a good opportunity of showing themselves at
their best, and it is fair to say they took ad
v. Rn A a . ge Â°* tne occasion last night. Mis-Lot
tie Williams as the stage-siruci: girl wanting
patronage was excellent, and Miss Bateman
was charmingly natural as Mary Miller, the
sailor's sweetheart.
"Dritting Apart" is a play without a villain,
but it is doubtiul whether a fool is not as bad.
Jack, with a charming wife and child, cannot
resist the alluring glass, and causes more
misery than the most accomplished vlliain.
Howard Kyle might have been better suited,
but he made the, best of the weak-minded
hero. Mrs. Sew ard must surely have taken
the beauty cure. She looked many years
younger than her son.
Although the theme of "Drifting Apart" is a
sad one there is no lack of fun. Edward J.
Heron made the pÂ«rt of Silas very amusing.
His specialties with Mis* Williams had to
be repeated many times. Walter Fessler and
Julia Blanc had good parts and filled them
well.
The costumes and staging were most effect
ive, particularly the house of the Sewards in
Boston.

The pretty Â±$ret Hartian drama, "Tennes

began at the Tivoli Opera-house last nieht.
On Thursday evening a complimentary testi
monial will be tendered Ferris Hartman at
the opera-house by bis many friends, ad
mirers and various clubs and fraterDal organ
izxtions of this City. On tins occasion a special
edition of "The Babes In the Wood" will be
given in which each member of the cast will
do a new specialty or song.
At the Orpheum.
Of the three new acts on the Orpheum bill
last night tne Quaker City Quartet and How
ard, the "Rube." made marked successes.
The Quaker quartetists are both vocalists and
instrumentalists. The two vocal soloists both
showed themselves to be the possessors of fine
barytone voices, and the ensemble work of the
quartet was excellent.
Howard, the "Rube," ingratiated himself
into popular favor by his comic pianoforte
playing. He gave exhibitions of such feats as
"Ta Ra Ra" with one hand and "Home, Sweet
Home" with the other, and the gallery to its
joy recognized both tunes and insisted on so
many enc-orea that it was only after the
orchestra had played down the popular de
monstration that the "Rube" was permitted
to depart. Howard's collaborator. Miss Bland,
sang without a voice a ditty which was chiefly
remarkable for its coarseness. Fortunately,
warblers of the Miss Bland variety are rare at
the Orpheum.
Miss Amanda d'Australie has not the style
of vocalization which prevails in music halls
On Sunday night she made the mistake of
playing her own accompaniment, but yester
day she was accompanied by the orchestra and
made a very favorable impression.
"Darkest Russia" will come to the California
Theater next week.
Professor T. A. Kennedy, the hypnotic won
der and king laugh-maker, will open at the
Bush-street Theater next Saturday.
"A Knight of the Lost Cause," by George S.

Hugo K. Asher, the Republican candi
date for Senator from the Twenty-first
Senatorial District, has forwarded to The
Call the following self-explanatory letter
relative to slanders cast upon a political
rival :
San Francisco, Nov. 1, 1896.
To the Editor of The Call: There has been cir
culated an anonymous leafletcaating discredit
upon one of the Senatorial candidates of tue
Twenty-first Senatorial District
I do not know whose interests were in
tended to be advanced by this unjust accusa
tion ; but I do not believe any of the candi
dates indorse this action. For myself, I am
heartily opposed to politics of this sort, and
will not give tbis slander any turther pub
licity by mentioning here the gentleman
attacked. To those In whose Hands it
has been placed I desire to say that
I earnestly hope that not one of them will

MURDER IN THE
ARCTIC OCEAN
First Mate Bowen of the
Balaena Brought Here
in Irons.
He Shot and Killed Second Mate
Frank Jones in a Quarrel
Over a Squaw.
KILLING NOT PREMEDITATED.
Wheat Is Coming in and the Wheat
Fleet Is Loading as Rapidly as
Possible.
Trouble seems to follow the whaling
fleet. Never have there been as many
disasters and never has there been as
much trouble in any one season. Yester
day the Balaena got in with the first mate,
H. P. Bowen, in irons. He is charged
with the murder of Frank Jones, the ves
sel's former second mate. Bowen was
taken off the ship by Sergeant Bunner
and Officer Ferguson, who delivered their
prisoner into the custody of the United
States Marshal.
The crime with which Bowen stands
charged was committed September 1 last
at Herschel Island. He killed Jones
after a desperate rough and tumble fight,
in which the second officer had all the
worst of it. The accused man declined to
discuss the affair yesterday, saying that
he was acting under instructions from his
attorneys. He declared, however, that he
had killed Jones in sel-defense.
Bowen is the man who five years ago
saved the crew of the American ship Ken
nebeck in San Pedro harbor. There came
up a terrible storm and the Kennebeck
went down. Bowen witnessed the event,
and securing two or three brave fellows
went to the rescue of the snipwrecked sail
ors. The entire crew was saved.
Among the passengers on the Balaena
was John E. Mapes, boat-steerer on the
Beluga. He and Captain Williams were
the only witnesses of the killing. Both
were great friends of Jones, and both say
the killing was not premeditated. The
dead man persisted in bringing a squaw
into the room where he and Bowen had
had their bunks. Many a time Bowen
put the woman out and just as oftdn Jones
brought her back. Finally a quarrel en
sued and Bowan pulled his gun and killed
his friend. Captain Williams refuses to
disciibs the matter, but the members of
the crew assert that Jones pulled his rifle
from the bracket and was ready to shoot
when Bowen fired his revolver. Bowen is
now charg d with murder.
The only movement among vessels along
the front is in the wheat fleet. The Wd
iamette got in yesterday with 40,000 sacks
ot wheat and the City of Benares, Forest
Hall and Valkyrie got away with full
loads for Europe. Half a dozen other
vessels are loaain^ and at least a dozen
are in the stream awaiting a chance to
dock and get rid of their cargoes. Many
of them are chartered, but otbers are here
on tne chance of getting a high rate when
wheat goes up.
Captain Fardelins of the schooner Arza
lea reportÃ that on October 24 at 11 a. m.
he passed a dead whale. It was in latitude
34.54 north, longitude 122.50 west and
looked like a ship's bottom. This was in
the vicinity of Poiot Conception and the
pilots assert that it was probably the
whale that was captured by the Wills'
hunters and exhibited at Sausalito last
month.
There will be very little done on the
front to-day. All the State offices will be
closed and all the voters will be uptown
looking out for election returns. There
will not be a ship discharging or receiving
cargo and in consequence the British cap
tains will have a grievance. Ail's well
that ends well, however, and the Britishers
will leave port with sound money in their
pockets and the fact that protection to
American industries is once more in force
firmly grounded in their memories.
George IV . .Elder is an efficient and
honest man. He ought to be elected
Superintendent of Streets.
CALIFORNIA FOR McKINLEY
Utmost Confidence Expressed by Re
publican Leaders.
Republicans are earnestly enjoined by
the State Central Committee to vote to
day for nine electors. Care should be
taken to stamp the cross on t 1 c square op
posit* the name of each of the nine elec
tors. Do not, in haste, only stamp once
in the middle of the nine or at the first
name at the top, but take time to affix the
cross to each of the nine McKinley and
Hobart electors. The precincts are many,
and so voters should not become appre
hensive that too much time is being taken
to stamp the ticket. Take tne time neces
sary to vote for all the Republican elec
tors. This is the earnest advice of the
Republican State Central Committee.
There is every Assurance that the vote
cast in San Francisco to-day will be fairly
counted. The most effective measures to
detect and prevent fraud in the counting
of the ballots have been adopted. Watch
ers specially appointed to watch the read
ing and the tally of the ballots will report
at their respective stations or duty one
hour before the close of thÂ« polls to-day.
Many speakers who have just finished
their tour ot campaign duty in the inte
rior reported at heaaquarters yesterday.
Confidence that McKinley will carry the
State is universal. The campaign man
agers (Major Frank McLaughlin, John D.
Spreckels and M. R. Hi gina) do not en
tertain the slightest doubt as to the result.
In making calculations on which the es
timate of a maiorlty for McKinley is
based the committee took the lowest fig
ures for McKinley and the highest for
Bryan. For example: If the canvassers
made returns to the committee tnat a
county would give McKinley from 200 to
400 majority the commit tee tigured on 200.
When the returns came that another
ounty would ive Bryan from 200 to 500
majority the 500 was accredited as Bryan's,
majority. On a careful revise of figures
the committee is confident that the Re
publicans will carry the State.
At the meeting of the Wheelmen's
Municipal League, held at the rooms of
the Olympic Club on Wednesday evening,
Fred W. Eaton was unanimously indorsed
