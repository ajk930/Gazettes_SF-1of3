Visiting Delegations to Canton Are
Also Told of the Evils of
Free Coinage.
CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 25.â Major Mc-
Kinley made four speeches to-day. The
first one was shortly alter 8 o'clock, and
from that time till 2:30 he was busy re
ceiving his callers. Every visitor insisted
upon shaking hands with the candidate.
To-morrow there are seventeen delega
tions expected. They will bring in the
aggregate more than 20,000 visitors to
Canton. One railway company has ar
ranged for fourteen special trains. Major
McKinley has found it necessary to make
his speeches shorter. All of his speeches
Saturday except one will be brief. To-day
he made his longest speech to a delegation
from Seneca County, Ohio. It was a wool
speech and wa- largely addressed to the
wool-producing States.
George E. Btnth of Tiffin was the
spokesman for the Seneca County delega
tion. His address was strong and his re
marks in presenting Major McKinley with
a handsomely framed steel engraving of
the late General William H. Gibson were
particularly eloquent. The picture was
presented on behalf of the widow of Gen
eral Gibson. In response to Mr. Strotn's
address Major McKinley said:
My xellow-citizens and ladies and gentle
men: I have been very much moved by the
generous mesasge which has been presented to
me by your si okesman in your behalf. I
reciprocate the kind words he has uttered and
the generous terms in which he has expressed
your assurances of good will and support
You could not have brought to me a gift
dearer or more to be cherished and longer to
be cherished than the picture of my old friend,
your friend, the friend of every soldier, the
friend of the whole country â General William
H. Gibson. [Great cheering.]
I am glad to congratulate your county upon
being now in the column of Republican coun
ties [applause], and I would not have you
forget that the only way it has become a Re
publican county is because the Democrats,
loving their country and wanting prosperity,
have joined the Republican ranks. [Laughter
and applause J And you must keep them with
you and continue to recruit from their ranks
to your own. [Applause.] This year is an
especially good one i or that sort of recruiting
service. Men of all parties this year, as in the
contest of the Civil War, when the Nation
was threatened with dismemberment, are
standing together for public honor and public
honesty; for good currency, good credit and
National good faith. [Applause.]
This is a year when those who stand op
posed to us indulge in glittering promises.
They offer a remedy which they say will cure
all our ills. We might accept their services
and take their remedies if we had not been
doctored before. [Laughter and applause.]
Free trade and free silver are the false friends
of labor. [Applause and cries of "That's
right."] They .ure with promises of cheap
commodities and cheap money. The partial
trial of free trade has proved that the cheap
commodities promised are dear to labor and
at the cost of labor, and cheap money will be
equally dear to them and a sacrifice to their
highest and best interests, [cries of "That's
right."] We cannot but remember the prom
ise* thai were made to the people in 1892 of
the universal beneficence which was to follow
the Inauguration of a tariff-for-revenue-only
policy, and with which prodigal bounty it was
to benefit labor, increase the purchasing power
of wages ana decrease the price of everything
it bough and increase the price of everything
it made. [Applause.] They did not "pan
out."
recall an utterance by the Hon. William M.
Springer, made in the House of Representa
tives April 4, 1892. when he was advocating
free wool. There may be some wool-growers
in this audie cc. [Cries of "Yea."] This is
what be said: "Pass this bill and thousands of
feet heretofore bare, and thousands of limbs
heretofore naked or covered with rags will be
clothed in suitable garments, and the condi
tion of all the peopie will be improved.
[Laughter.] It will give employment to 50,000
more operatives in woolen mills. It will in
crease the demand for wool and prices will in
crease, and with increased demand for labor
wages will increase. Those who favor its pas
sage may be assured that they have done
something to promote the general weal, some
thing to scatter plenty o'er this smiling land."
Well, the free-wool bill was passed. Have
any of you realized the promises then made T
[Cries of "No, no."] Wool was made free and
every man in this country knows how poorly
the performances have tallied with the prom
ises then made. Instead of adding 50.000
laborers to the payrolls of the woolen-mills it
has taken off more than that number. The
price of wool hHs fallen, and with what effect
upon the manufacturer I will show hereafter.
The wools of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan,
New York, New England, Connecticut and
Missouri, twenty-four varieties, washed and
unwashed: The average price in April. 1890,
was 30.3 cents per pound; In April, 1896, 17.4
cents per pound, a decline of more than 42 per
cent. The wool of Texas, Calffornia, Oregon,
Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Mexico,
Georgia and the South, twenty-nix vari
eties, scoured: Price in April, 1890,
was ' 49.1 cents per cound; in April,
1896, 27-4 cents per pound, a decline
of 44.2 per cent. Other wools, ten varieties,
scoured: In April, 1890, 45.9 cents per pound;
in 1896 28.5 cents per pound, a decline of 38
percent. So great a decline cannot be found
in any other commodity. Ohio wool nas
dropped from 29 cents in 1892 to 18 cents per
pound in 1896. This will give you some idea
of what free wool has dose for the wool
producers in the United States. How has it
affected the manufacturer? It is well known
that there is but one customer for the wool
grower of the United States, and that customer
is the manufacturer of the United States.
The American wool-grower baa no foreign
market to-day. He cannot compete In any
other market with tiie wools grown on cheap |

lands and by cheaper labor of other countries.
This is bis market, and when it is taken from
him it entails loss and ruin to him.
In the first year of free wool 12 0,000,000
pounds of clothing wools came to our ports,
an increase of over 200 per cent as compared
with the largest quantity received when a
duty was imposed. And the total imports of
all classes reached 250,000,000 pounds, while
175,000,000 pounds were the largest importa
tions ever made under dutiable wools. Have
these free imports of wool benefited the manu
facturer? [Cries of "No! Nol"] The two years
in which the manufacturers have enjoyed
free wool have been the most disastrous in
the history of American wool manufactories â
greater than the disaster which followed the
close of tnc v. ar in 1812, or thÂ» panics of 1853
and 1857. (Applause.] It is a well-known
fact that since ire*; wool it has not been possi
ble to make woolen goods in the United States
with any confidence that they would sell in
the market for what it cost to make them.
The imports of woolen goods following free
wool were simply enormous They averaged
$5,000,000 a month in value, so that at the i
end ol the first year under the new law the
total value of woolen goods imported had ex
ceeded $60,000,000 foreign value. In 1895
it is estimated that nearly one-half of the
woolens which entered into consumption were
of foreign make. We have in this country
enough woolen machinery to manuf cturc all
our wants, but it is not all in demand under
present conditions. We must start ail the
machinery in the United States, my fellcw
citizens of Seneca County. [Applause.] Whi.e
they are idle working people are looking for a
job; foreign wool-growers are sending their
wool to the United States while American
larmers arc se ling their flocks. [Applause
and cries of "That's right."]
Contemplating these figures and this con
dition, what do you think of Mr. Springer's
prediction? [Great laughter.] Every word of
his prophecy has proved false; every promise
has been broken. [Applause and cries of
"That's right."] If this is "scattering plenty
o'er a smiling land" we pray God to spare us
any more of it. [Great laughter and applause.]
Those who promised plenty and prosperity
under free trade are now assuring us that they
can only be secured through free silver.
[Laughter and cries of "No."] How will free
silver stop the impor.ation of foreign wool?
[Cries of "It won't."] How can free silver check
the appalling importations of woolen goods
from the Old World? [Cries of "It can't do it."]
How can free silver preserve the home market
to the wool-producer and the woolen-manu
facturer? [Renewed cries of "It can't do it."]
My fellow-citizens, it is as delusive as free
trade. It will only further cripple every in
terest in the United States.
How can free silver increase the demand for
American labor and American products? An
swer me that. [Cries of "It can't doit."] Re
member, my fellow-citizens, that money does
not make business. It never did and it never
will. Business makes money. [Cries of

"That's right."] Poor money never helped
legitimate business in the history of mankind.
It has always hurt it It is destructive to
every interest but that of the speculator.
[Applause.] What is true of wool is true of
other industries. All have been suffering; if
not to the same extent, it is because the blow
on other industries was not so severe. We
want in this country a sound Government, a
sound tariff and sound money. [Great ap
plause.] And we want to take care of this
goodly inheritance of ours and keep it what it
has been, for the most part, in all its glorious
history â the most prosperous beneath the tun,
with more happy and contented homes than
can De found in any other country of the world.
]Appiause.)
To a delegation from Marion, Ind.,
-which arrived in Cantos shortly after 7
o'clock this raominjr, Major McKinley
spoke in part as follows:
I congratulate you Â»pon being first to-day.
[Laughter.] No other delegation has yet pre
ceded you. [Renewed laughter. ] You hare in
your city of Marion, as I recall, an industry
which manufactures glass that used to be in
the city of Canton. Am I right about that?
[Cries of "Yes, yes."] It is a good industry.
Weil, now, that fairly illustrates my idea.
That used to be, as I said, a Canton Industry.
Vt'e would very much have preferred to have
had it remain here, but it was taken away.
However it did not go out of our own country.
[Great applause and cries of "Good, good."]
it went into a neighboring State and therefore
benefits the Aimruai) family; American
workmen still do the work. We share
in your good fortune and prosperity,
but we would have felt differently
if it had gone on the other side
and out of the United States. [Cries of "Yes,
we would."] In a word, we want to do our
manufacturing at. home [Great cheering and
cries of "That's right"], and if we cannot do
it in Ohio we are willing to have you do it in
Indiana. [Renewed cheering.] We want in
this country good times, good wages, steady
employment, a good home market and then
we want to continue the good, sound, round,
honest doliars [Cheering and loud cries of
"That's what we want"] with which to do our
business and pay our labor. [Renewed cheer
ing.]
At 11 o'clock 800 citizens of Meadville
and Crawford County, Pa., arrived. Major
McKinley was repeatedly cheered when he
appeared on the porch. Dr. T. L. Flood
was the speaker.
In the Crawford County delegation were
half the faculty and 100 of the students of
Allegheny College. Major McKinley was
a student ai this college, and his !_â¢ reeling
was ardent. In response to Dr. Flood's
remarks Major McKinley said:
It gives me genuine pleasure to greet and

P CULIAE SCENES IN COURT.

Di charge of Prisoners Pub
licly Disgraced.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Sept. 25.â The 150
miners from Joplin, Mo., arrived safely in
Lead vi He at 5 o'clock and were escorted
by squads of militia to quarters prepared
for them at the Emmet, Marion and ad
joining mines in the downtown district.
Though there was some jeering by men
and women in the great crowd assembled
at the depot to witness the arrival of this
first installment of non union miners, no
acts of violence were committed.
The camp remains at peace and as quiet
as it has been throughout the three
months' strike. The militia are entirely
capable of maintaining order, and they
are prepared to act promptly and without
hesitation. It will be shoot to kill if the
slightest demonstration indicating a riot
occurs.
The court of inquiry has accomplished
HON. CARROLL COOK*
nothing, and it will probably cease its sit
tings shortly.
The legal phase of the strike occurred
to-day upon a hearing before Judge Owers
of the District Court to bail for the twenty
two prisoners charged with the murder of
Fireman O'Keafe at the Coronado Monday
morning. The Sheriff and Marshal testi
fi d that the arrests had been made upon
complaints, and they personally had no
knowledge of evidence sufficient to hold
any of the prisoners.
District Attorney Thomas wanted all
the cases dismissed, but this the court de
clined to do. The attorney for the de
fendants also requested a hearing of the
merits of the cases before dismissal or a
finding.
The District Attorney in the afternoon
created a scene and was ordered out of the
courtroom by the Judge, the Sheriff
escorting the disgraced officer of the court
from the hall.
Judge Owers decided that in view of the
state of affairs existing here and for the
reason that the defendants and he him
self desired a thorough investigation to be
made the prisoners should be released on
bail in sums of $500, and the Sheriff was
directed to accompany the miners who
desired to co out and obtain sureties.
Although interest centered about the
Courthouse and a great crowd gathered
during the hearing no trouble occurred,
the militia preventing a crush of specta
tors in the courtroom.
In the afternoon a crowd also gathered
about the Rio Granae depot to await the
arrival of the special train bringing in the
Joplin miners. The depot was surrounded
by State troops, and no one without a pass
was permitted to cross the lines.
At 1:30 four carloads of the local citizen
soldiery were sent to Malta, four miles be
low, to guard the train &s it came in. The
train arrived at Malta at about 4 o'clock.
After some delay, it proceeded cautiously
up to the city. Along the line of the tracks,
in the suburbs, there was no demonstra
tion. On the arrival of the train at the
Poplar-street depot, the miners alighted
and formed on the depot platform.
The order of march was given and the
newcomers, preceded by the soldiers and
flanked and backed by the guards, started
for the hills. Their progress was viewed
by thousands. At some points on the line
demonstrations were made against them
and there were jeers from the striking
miners and women and children.

Though the Republican convention of
the City and Couuty of San Francisco was
in session for two hours last night, so
much of the time had to be devoted to
permitting the delegates and the specta
tors to give expression to their em. usi
asm over the various nominations that it
was possible to nominate candidates only
for Superior and Police Judges and Jus
tices of the Peace, as above.
Some few there were who thought
further work of the convention would be
postponed pending a definite result from
the conference called by Chairman Me-
Laughlin of the Republican State Central
Committee for the purpos? of giving the
recalcitrants under the leadership of
Martin Kelly an opportur. ity to make their
peace and to ciimb into the band wagon.
But feeling secure in the justice and
strength of its position, the very existence
of the Kelly-Raineyites appeared to be
forgotten, and the labors of the delegates
went ah ad with an enthusiasm that ex
celled any yet exhibited.
They were stimulate! with the lust for
battle by the inglorious rout of the enemy,
ana there was a vim and force about the
proceedings that spoke in subtle but un
mistakable tones of a deep and strong con
fidence in victory against the machinations
of the traitors who claimed allegiance to
the Republican party, and against the
more manly adversaries of the opposing
parties.
Secretary Andy Branch was wroth and
indignant over the unfounded charge
made in one of the Kelly-Rainey organs
yesterday morning that a iraud had been
perpetrated in recording the vote for Su
perintendent oi Public Instruction. It
was charged that votes for Babcock had
been Knowingly and with fraudulent intent
counted for WeDster. Secretary Branch's
explanation of the matter shows that
malice alone prompted the publication in
question.
Uis rollcall, which is open at any time

sires to see it, shows that the original
vote when the last delegation had an
nounced its choice stood 131 for WebÃter
and 111 for Babcock. Then the Twenty
eighth changed five votes to Babcock and
the Forty-fourth changed three votes to
the same candidate. This made the cor
rected vote stand : Webster 123, Babcock
119. In announcing the result the chair
man called the unrevised totals instead of
the corrected figures, and on this mistake
the charge of iraud was based. A minute
or two given to honest investigation would
have shown the true state of affairs and
prevented an unjust charge against a
painstaking, abie and honest official ol the
convention.
John Hebbaro, John Hunt, Carroll Cook,
C. K. Bonestell and John F. Finn were
placed in nomination by eloquent spon
sors for Superior Judges. Chairman Rior
dan resigned ihe chair that he might have
the pleasure of placing in nomination his
schoolmate of thirty years agoâ Carroll
Cook. Lincoln E. Savage, in nominating
Finn, prefaced his eulogy of that gentle
man by saying: "I was sent tÂ« jail for
twenty-four hours for contempt of court
that is what I got from Judge Hebbard."
"Good," shouted a voice from the galÂ»
lery, and almost instantly the entire house
was in a roar of laughter at the expense of
the speaker.
It was not uhtil the Thirty-first District
was called that a vote was cast for Heb
bard. The five votes announced for him
here started the convention cheering at
each announcement of a vote until the
enthusiasm became a nuisance, and the
chairman was forced to request the audi
ence to refrain from any demonstration
until the result of the ballot was an
nounced, but when the chairman an
nounced his vote for Hebbard he was
loudly applauded.
Ju ige Hunt had the proud and unusual
distinction of receiving the solid vote of
the delegates of the convention. The real
contest was between Hebbard, Finn and
Boneste!!. though at no stage of the ballot
ing was Hebbard really in the tight.
There having been only four nominations
for Police Judge 3 and five for Justices of
the Peace all the candidates for these
offices were nominated oy acclamation.
The convention expects to conclude its
labors to-night, there remaining nomina
tions to be made only for Supervisors and
School Directors.

When the convention was called to or

chair without formality announced he had
appointed the following committee to se
lect candidates for the Board of Educa
tion: Robert Ash, Robert S3hlein, John
M. Chretien, Martin Stevens, J. Alva
Watt, C. G. Clinch, T. B. Riordan, James
Simpson, J. P. Stevens and George W.
( > r y.
The work of nominating candidates was
then resumed, the nominations of the
Judges of the Superior Court coming up
first.
J. P. Stevens of the Forty-third District
nominated Judge Hebbard in an eloquent
speech eulogistic of his choice, and the
nomination was vigorously seconded by
P. A. Bergerot.
Judge S. C. Denson nominated Judge
John Hunt, describing him as a man who
has helped to make the social, political
and judicial history of this City. "He is a
sure winner," said Judge Denson. "His
career has been such as to bring to him
the trust and confidence of the bar and
also the citizens of San Francisco. He is
an every-time winner."
J. M. Chretien tried hard to second the
nomination of Judjre Hunt, and struggled
with an almost complete lack of voice,
making a neat and brief speech. By diut
of exertion and lemon juice he made hira
*e!f heard all over the house and was re
warded with applause when he named
Judge Hunt.
Chairman Riordan said he would nomi
nate but one candidate, and that only
through friendship running back for a
number of years. "The man 1 wish to
nominate," he said, "is one whose knowl
edge of criminal law is a household word
in San Francisco â Carroll Cook. [Ap
plause.] He and 1 were schoolmates over
thirty years ago. We studied law together,
and ah through his professional career I've
been near him, and I can say here to-night
that not one crooked thing can be laid at
.his door. [Applause.J There are many
people in ban Francisco who know that
there have been many poor devils charged
with some offense, and Carroll Cook, if
there were any merit in their cases, de
fended them without fee or reward."
Tbe speaker concluded by referring to
the old galaxy of brilliant lawyers who
have passed away from San Francisco.
One of them was Elisha Cook, father of
Carroll Cook, the worthy father of a worthy
pon, and Carroll was the worthy son of a
worthy father.
William H. Schooler of the Forty-first
District seconded the nomination of Car
roll Cook and eulogized him for his expe
rience and ability and said his name is a
household word.
By a strong majority vote the nominat
ing speeches of candidates were limited to
five minutes and this expedited matters
considerably.
Hugh W." Fraser of the Thirty-ninth
District named Chester K. Bonestell, say
ing that he is well known and popular.
Frank Powers seconded the nomination
of Bonesiell.
L. Savage of the Thirty-sixth District
N. H. Burnham, Regular Republi
can Choice for Senator From the
Seventeenth Senatorial District.
named ex-Judge Finn. "Before I tell
you anything about him," he said, "I
want to say I was sent to jail for twenty
four hours by Judge Hebbard for con
tempt. The gentleman I wish to nomi
nate is the Hon. John P. Finn, who sat
four years on the Superior bench of San
Francisco. I must say he is one of the
fairest, mo-t even-minded of men, and as
to his ability as a lawyer you all know
that." He was interrupted by cries of
"time," and added: "Gentlemen of the
convention, if you nominate Judge Finn
you won't make a mistake."
Martin Stevens said: "The solid Thirty
ninth District, eighteen votes strong,
seconds the nomination of Judge Finn
and Mr. Bones tell."
The nominations were closed and the
balloting began, the result being as fol
lows: Hunt 239, Cook 226, Bonestell 191,
Finn 201, Hebbard 99. The first four
named were declared by the chair the
nominees of the convention.
The next business before the conven
tion was the nomination of four Police
Judges, the announcement of which was
greeted by applause from the gallery. E.
S. Salomon presented the name of Judge
Campbell, sayine: "The office of Police
Judge of the City and County of San
Francisco is second to no other in im
portance. There has been a gentleman in
that position who is well-known, who has
occupied it against the slurs and attacks
heaped upon him. And yet there Is not a
man, woman or child in the City who' can
point the finger of scorn against James A.
Campbell."
Loud and prolonged cheering greeted
the name, and even the vigorous rapping
of tbe chairman's gavel failed to restore
order among the enthusiastic delegates
and spectators.
"Judee Campbell is a good fellow," at
last yelled the chair, "but time is very
valuable to us to-night."
"You bet he is a good fellow," came
ixom the gallery.
The applause and repeated interrup
tions delayed Salomon until the time al
lowed ior nominating speeches had passed.
P. A. Bergerot seconded the nomination
of Judge Campbell as the friend of the
poor man and the laboring man; as the
man for whom all the labor organizations
and fraternal organizations are clamor
ing; as the man who will be elected as
surely as he is nominated.
Frank H. Powers said he was going to
nominate a man perhaps quite as popular
in his way as Judge Campbell, hut still a
man who is respected downtown, and the
peer of any man who has sat on the police
bench, who had a record as a magistrate
when he came to San Franciscoâ Judare
: Joachimsen. [Applause. J
John H. Durst said that some man is
wanted in whose veins runs the blood of
! the Spanish people. He named A. B.
' Tread* ell, who was for six years a ruae
\ istrate of Stockton. [Cheers and continued
applause.] The business men will vote
for him and tue workingmen will vcte for
him. The nomination was seconded by
William H. Schooler.
Jud^e Charles A. Low wai placed in
nomination by Judge 8. C. Denson, who
declared that not a word can be said
against his character. "I seoond the
nomination of Jud^eLow; he is a good
fellow, and I hope he will be nominated,"
said a delegate irom the Twenty-eighth.
Delegates on the floor added their sec-
I onds to tbe nominations already proposed
and the nominations were declared closed.
The nominations, on motion, were made
by acclamation, and the convention pro
| cecded to name candidates for Justices of
the Peace.
C. X. Fairall of the Thirty-ninth District
recommended as a gentleman who as a
Justice has been honest and upright and
just, who has brought honor to tbe bench,
Frank H. Kerrigan, whom he nominated.
W. \Y. Allen nominated G. C. Groezin
ger, who, he said, is a gentleman of legal
wisdom, and will surely be elected. The
convention might well feel prond of him
as a representative Republican on the Jus
tices' bench.
General Salomon placed in nomination
Justice E. \V. F. Cook, as the nestor of the
bench.
Judge Denson named that "very capa
ble and handsome young native son.
{ James E. Barry, who* now occupies with
distinction and honor to himself tbe posi
tion of Justice of the Peace." The name
of Barry was cheered in the galleries.
! Frank Powers seconded the nomination,
! saying that Barry was a sure winner and
highly respected.
Robert Ash seconded the nomination of
Groezinger.
O. K. McMurray was presented in behalf
of the Thirty-ninth District.
The nominations were closed and on
motion ol General Salomon those named
| were all declared tne nominees of the con
i vention by acclamation.
The convention then adjourned until 8
o'clock this evening.
Nominee for City and County At
torney.
John R. Aitken, the regular Republican
nominee for City and County Attorney, is
a man deserving in a special way the sup
port of the people of San Francisco. He
is of the soil â a native son, a graduate of
the University of California and the
Hastings Law College, and, being a self
made man, bis candidacy appeals strongly
to the people in his present canvas?. He
was born in San Francisco March 31, 1854
Thrown upon his own resources at an
early age, by economy, industry and
perseverance he was enaDled to earn a
livelihood, and by close application., at in
tervals in his employment, he managed to
acquire an education and prepare himself
to enter the University of California.
After pursuintc the prescribed course of
study in this institution he graduated and
entered the Hastings Law College. Upon
his admission to the bar he commenced

REPUBLICAN VETERANS.
Addresses by A. P. Van Duzer and
W. H. W. Smithâ Cheerlnsr News
From Ohio and Indiana.
A rousing meeting of the McKinley
Veteran Soldiers' and Sailors' Republican
Club of California was held last night at
113 Turk street. The club is in a flourish
ing condition and is constantly receiving
accessions to its membership.
Tbe first speaker last night was A. P.
Van Duzer. He talked directly to the
point and received many commendations
lor his address.
W. H. W. Smith, a colored man and
preacher, as well as a comrade of the
Grand Army, to d his audience how little
had been done by the Republican party
managers to reach the 15,000 colored
voters in California.
He spoke of tbe great number of colored
voters in Fresno County and said speakers
should bo sent to address tuem.
J. A. Whiteside, a veteran, prominently
identified with tbe club, has just received
a letter from H. L. Morey, ex-member of
Congress from the Third Ohio District,
The letter is dated Hamilton, September
18. Mr. Morey writes:
Answering your inquiry, the forcing of the
free silver issue at the beginning brought out
a considerable free silver sentiment, especially
amonsr the farmers, and created some appre
.'â .onsion ou our part; but from the first the
battle for sound money was won in all. the
citiep.
The tendency in my view is marked in our
favor everywhere. Such a united sentiment

Hon. A* B. TreadwelL
among the great newspapers, manufacturers,
bankers, railroads, trust companies, wage
earners, clerks and officials was uever known
to be on any question so marked as it is now
In favor of sound money and in condemnation
of the anarchistic tendencies of the Bryan
combination.
The farmers are suffering from low prices
and hard times, and, of course, were more
easily attracted by the reductive cry of free
silver and more money, but they aro an hon
orable and sensible class and are receiving in
structions with avidity.
An intelligent oDserver who resides In
Indianapolis said to me yesterday that the Re
publican party will carry Indiana by 40,000
majority. We will carry Illinois, Ohio and
Indiana by great minorities. I look for Ohio
to give McKinley more than 100,000 majority.
I have no definite opinion about Illinois, but I
believe his majority there will be very large.
In a conversation yesterday with General
Boynton of Washington, D. C, be said that the
result In Maine is but an index of what will
happen in all the States east of tne Ohio. I
do not remember a campaign since the war
period in which the people -were so intensely
Interested as In the present one.
N. H. Burnham Chosen.
Tbe Seventeenth Senatorial District
Club, comprising the Twenty -eighth and
Twenty-ninth Assembly Districts, met last
night for the purpose of nominating a
Senator on the Republican ticket. D. J.
Crowley presided at the meeting and
Charles Cory acted as secretary. T. F.
Bryant placed N. H. Burnham in nomina
tion, T. McDermott seconded tbe same.
There being no other choice N. H. Burn
ham was elected unanimously as the Re
publican nominee for Senator from the
Seventeenth Senatorial District. N. H.
Burnham, who was born October 5, 1851,
and resides at 305 Fremont street, came to
California in the year 1870, from Hartford,
Conn., where his parents were born, being
a scion of Rood old Connecticut stock. He
has resided in the district which he will
represent since 1870 and has been a Re
publican all his life. He is a "working
man, whar. -builder by trade, comes from
a workingmau's district and is a man of
family.
HOME PRODUCTS.
Conspicuously Boycotted by the
Democratic P^rty In. This
City.
A Democratic banner stretched across
Market street, and bearing the portraits of
Bryan and Sewall, has the following in
scription at the bottom advertising the
makers of the banner:
National Campaign Equipment Company,
N'os. 31 and 35 Fourth street, New York.
This is thoroughly in accord with Demo
cratic precedent. That party believes in
buying the products of cheap European
labor abroad while the factories of this
country are lying idle. Even while there
are scores and scores of good sign-painters
in this City competent to paint better por
traits of Bryan and Sewall than appear
upon the Market-street banner, the Demo
cratic party, true to its habit of bovcot
tinp home products, has sent to New York
for its banner.
This is the Democratic policy of buying
in the cheapest market.

PACING EACE NOT DECIDED.
Tampa Wins ths Six-Furlong Dash
Frcm Ricardo in a Hard
Drive.
STOCKTON, Cal., Sept. 25.â 8y bis
performance to-day at the track C. A.
Winship's great gelding Ottinger Bhowed
himself to be a candidate well worthy to
wear the title of "king of trotters," and
the honest-going little fellow will, if noth
ing happens to him, take a shy at the
mark in 1897. To-day he came out victor
of the 2:10 trot in the fastest four heats
ever trotted on the Pacific Coast, and re
duced his record of 2:10J4, made at Sacra
mento, to 2:o9Â£Â£. Timed separately, he is
said to have stepped the second heat in
2:oB}^â and this with ease. In the first
heat, taken by lago in a famous finish
from Stam B, he made his only break in
three years at the first turn and finished
last. Coming out for the second heat, be
was as. steady as clockwork, and held his
neld safe at every stage of the journey.
The time for the four heats was 2 :ll}Â£â
2:09^â2:10^â 2:09%.
In tho three deciding heats the gelding
went to the half on each occasion in
1 :03J-a* He was driven by Mr. Winsbip's
newly signed reinsman, Charles Jeffries,
and the youne Montana driver bids fair to
more than fill the place left vacant by the
resignation of Tommy Keating. For the
first time since his recent arrival in Cali
fornia Jeffries held the ribbons over Ottin
ger, and by ,the way he piloted him
showed himself well capable of handling
the fast Winship string.
C. A. Winship, the wealthy owner of
the record-breaking gelding, was greatly
elated over his win. Mr. Winship said to
night that a year ago his trainer told him
Ottinger was sore and broken down and
advised him to sell him at any price. Be
lieving differently, he put some training
methoils of his own into effect, with the
result that Driver Andy McDowell told the
proud owut- r at the conclusion of the race
to-day that he believed Ottinger capable
of beating the great Azote's record.
The attendance to-day was the biggest
of the meeting, over 3000 people being on
the grounds. The school children were ad
mitted free, and many of the business
houses closed their doors. Business with
both tbe auction pools and Paris mutuels
was very brisk.
The 2:10 trot was first on the programme.
Ottinger was an overwhelming favorite in
tbe betting, selling for $20, with the whole
field bringing but $9. la the opening heat
the favorite, who drew the outside
position, was crowded at tbe. first turn and
went to a break. McDowell, behind lago,
took the pole, and that horse and Stam B
fought it out to the wire, lago getting the
decision by a nose in 2:llJ^.
TLe field now took an upward jump,
with many supporters. Jeffries was better
acquainted with his horse, and sending
him along overhauled laeo in the stretch,
and the favorite came Dome an easy win
ner in 2:09%. The following two heats
were repetitions of the second, Ottinger win
ing each hands down in 2 :lo}Â£, 2 :0Q%. lago
touK second money and fcUru B, which
was second in three of the heats trotted,
earned third money. The latter showed
himself a most promising colt.
The 2:15 pace remains unfinished, with
a heat each to the oredlt of Frank L and
Prince Nutwood and two to the credit of
Belle, driven by Sullivan. Our Boy was
favorite in tbe pooling at $10, with Belle
bringing $6 and the field $5. Frank L won
the first heat uway off in 2:l4}Â£, with
Prince Nutwood second. In the second
heat Prince Nutwood, Frank L and Our
Boy finished heads apart at the wire in the
order named. Time, 2tl3W. The field
now sold favorite at $10, with Our Boy
bringing $6 and Frank L $5. The heat
preceding had told on the front horses,
and Bel.c took the third and fourth heats
off the reel. As a running race had yet to
be decided, the pace was postponed until
to-morrow at 1 o'clock.
Six started in tbe six-furlong running
dash. In the opening betting the field
brought $20, Gladiola $18 and Tampa $5.
It later shifted in favor of Gladioia.
Tampa and Ricardo made the running
from tne jump. In a hard drive Golden
landed Tampa a winner by a neck in 1:14,
with Howard third. The winner was bid
up $300 over her entered selling price of
tbe same amount by Capps, the trainer of
the second horse. The money was not
forthcoming at the expiration of tbe time
allowed tba bidderg-up by the rules, and
Capps stands a good chance of being

GIMM WINS THE RACE.
And Lowers the World's Twenty- JTour-
Hour liecord.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 25.â Louis Gimm
of Cleveland lowered the American pro
fessional bicycle record for twenty-four
hours (paced), which he held, and won a
purse of $400 at the Coliseum to-night. The
twenty-four hours expired at 9 o'clock,
but Gimm was an easy winner and quit at
8:36. He covered 486 miles 1151 yards in
twenty-three hours and 36 minutes.
Fifteen thousand people saw the finish
and enthusiastically cheered the winner.
Gimm finished in bad shape physically.
Frank Waller of New York, who hoMs a
24-hour record of 490 miles made in Lon
don, rode a hard finish and came in second.
He was in better condition than any of
the other riders. He rode 482 miles 968
yards in twenty-four hours. He was well
in the lead and probably would have
broken the world's record, but at 2:56 this
morning he stubbornly persisted in filling
his stomach and taking a rest in spite of
protests from his trainer. He remained
off the track fifty-eight minutes, which
lost him the race. He wanted to quit
then and put on his street clotues, but was
soon induced to again get on his wheel.
Fred Schimmer of Chicago, who re
cently was made a professional, cot t'hlrd
money, coverine 462 miles and 567 yards.
0L W. Milier of Chicago started out as a
likely winner, but finished fourth with
459 and 233 yards to his credit. Lyman
Myers of Minneapolis and Bert Harding
of St. Louis scored 400 miles and over to
get prizes aud then quit. C. A. Schoch of
Minneapolis broKe all records for continu
ous riding. He rode 273 miles without
getting off his wheel and in 400 mile 3 was
off only tVi'o minutes.
DIXON MEETS HIS MATCH.
Tommy White Divides the Honors With
the Colored Lad.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 25.â George
Dixon, the champion featherweight of the
world, fought the hardest battle of his
career when he had finished his twenty
round boat with Tommy White of Chicago
to-night. The colored lad went into tbe
ring a hot favorite, but before half the
battle was over tbe 5000 spectators saw
that he was not the Dixon of former
battles. At times he showed some of
his old-time cyclonic dash, but the rest
less energy and terrific punching power
that made him famous were not there.
Dixon met bis match at last, and
although the decision of a draw was a
fair one, there were many whn thought
that White had the best of the encounter.
The Western man lacked steam behind
his blows and depended almost entirely
on his left, with which he jabbed Dixon
time and time again, until his nose and
mouth were bleeding freely and his left
eye badly puffed up.
White was undeniably game and clever,
and the manner n which he blocked and
avoided Dixon's rushes and swings gained
him ihÂ« admiration of the crowd. Al
though White's face was unmarked at the
end of the struggle his body showed the
effects of the blows which Dixon landed.
Had the Westerner possessed more hitting
power Dixon must certainly have gone
down before the blows which were landed
plentifully on his jaw during the battle.
As it was. White had all the best of the
last round and smilingly jabbed Dixon all
around the ring, landing on the damaged
face, while the colored lad clinched des
perately.

Reflections of a Bachelor.
Women aren't the only ones that marry
for a home.
A woman has no use for a man who
never lies to her.
Men can beat women all hollow about
minding their own business.
The less use a man has for himself the
more use A woman has for him.
By the time a mm really knows enough
to get married he thinks he knows enough
not to.
Juiu because a woman makes lore the
way they do in novels, don't imagine it is
all put on.
When a man has the chance and a
woman thinks he isn't going to kiss her,
she tries to make him think she thought
he was.
Before marriage couples sit quiet because
they don't know now "to say it ; after mar
riage it's because they don't know what 10
say.â New York Press.

THE REBEL YELL ALBO HEARD.
But There Are Present Those Who
Hiss for Bryan and Cheer
for McKinley.
BALTIMORE, Mb., Sept. 25.âMary
land gave Palmer and Buckner a rousing
welcome to-night. Four tnousand per
sons paid tribute to the two brave com
manders who were on opposite sides in
the great struggle which closed a genera
tion ago. The two war-norses of tne
sound-money Democrats were the star at
traction at the Maryland ratification meet
ing of the National Democratic party,
which was neld at Music Hall. The fre
quent mention of Bryan's name was
cheered by quite a number, while others
as vigorously hissed every allusion to the
silver candidate.
A Palmer and Buckner electoral ticket
was put in the field by the adoption of a
report made by a special committee. A
great cheer announced the appearance of
General Palmer and General Buckner.
The band added to the tumult by playing
"My Old Kentucky Home" and "Mary
land, My Ma-yland."
When the enthusiasm subsided some
what Chairman Donaldson introduced
General Palmer, who received another
ovation. After touching upon the past
struggles between the North and the South
General Palmer said:
"1 am here to-night in the attitude of a
candidate for President of the United
States without expectation of being
elected. In fact, in the preface of the
declaration of principles adopted by the
Indianapolis convention it did not as
sert that the convention had any such ex
pectations. It was in the face of that
distinct political utterance that I accepted
the nomination that was kindly offered
to me.
"The delegates to the Indianapolis con
vention," said Palmer, "were Democrats,
not Republicans or Populists. They felt
constrained to announce to the country
that they could not support the Chicago
nominees nor the platform adopted there."
Every time he mentioned Bryan's name j
there was an uproar â a commingling of j
ciieers and hisses. That there were sev- j
era! Republicans in the audience was man- ;
ifested by the enthusiasm which greeted ;
the mention of Major McKinley's name. !
The cheering and hisses continued until 1
the Prohibition platform was reached and |
Joshua Levering was spoKen of. There
were no hisses then. The Mary lander was
cheered again and again.
Concluding his discussion of platforms
and candidates General Palmer took up
the financial question. After congratu
lating Bryan and his snpporters on their
unparalleled boldne-s in making certain
"outrageous claims" General Palmer
added that it is astonishing that in the
light of human experience such proposi
tions should be entertained by sane men.
He said the United States must continue
to force its own laws by its own methods.
[Applause.]
The credit of the United States and of
the several States must be maintained.
The people must not be invited to repu
diation. [Cheers.]
As General Palmer concluded General
Buokner was introduced. The scene was
dramatic. The border-line audience gave
the Kentucky candidate a special wel
come, and the cheers were intermingled
with the rebel yell.
The general discussed the financial ques
tion, but his areument was lost to most of
those who tried to follow him because of
the noise made by hundreds who were
leaving the ball.

RUINED BY FREE TRADE
Continued from JFirtt Poqu
welcome you here at my home. I recall with
sensations of pleasure and satisfaction the
brief time I spent in old Allegheny College.
It if among the dearest memories of my life.
That old institution only a year ago conferred
upon me a very distinguished honor. I trust
I may never disappoint Its confidence. [Ap
plause and cries of "You never will."] Now,
my iellow-cHizens, what we want this year is
to cast our ballots for that party and for those
principles which will secure to us the greatest
prosperity. [Applause.] We want no idle
men in the United Btates. [Applause.] We
want no idle mills in the United States. [Re
newed applause.] And to the end that we
may have neither idle mills nor idle meu we
must do our work in the United States. [Great
Cheering.]
You may disagree with me, but I believe in
a protective tariff. [Applause] Then, my fel
low-citizens, having secured a tariff that will
defend American interests, we want to con
tinue the use of tne good dollars we have had
since 1879. [Great applause.] We want no
clipped coins in the United States. [Renewed
applause.] We want no debased dollars any
more than we want debased labor. [Applause.]
And when men have given a fnll day's work to
an American employer we want that American
employer to pay in dollars 6i good as any dol
lars Anywhere in tne world and worth 100
cents every day and everywhere. [Tremen
doui applause.] I thank you most heartily,
gentlemen, for the kindness and courtesy of

The third delegation was from Wyan
dotte County, Ohio. It arrived at noon
and marched at once to Major McKinley's
house. The spokesmen were General T.
M. Kirby and P. Cuneo, a Republican
editor, who is a native of Genoa, Italy. In
response to the remarks of the spokesmen
Major McKinley made a brief speech, in
which h* said :
We must have in the United States an Ameri
can policyâ a policy that will take care of our
own; thai will defend our own. [Applause.]
If we do nÂ»t do that, nobody will do it for us.
[Cries of 'That's right."] And fortunately in
this countrr Â«c have the power among our
aclvesâthe mighty ballotâ to make just such
an administrative and executive and legis
lative policy w we believe will subserve tie
highest and best interests of all the people.
[Great applause.] Now, yours is a farming
population, I know all about your county.
What you want in Wyandotte County is to
have somebody want and want badly what you
produce on your farm*, [cries of "That's right"]
and I have discovered that the farmer always
gets better prices when a lot of buyers are
hunting him up, rather than when the farmers
are hunting up the buyers. [Applause and
cries of "That's right."] Now, whtt the farmer
Is interested in further is when he has a cus
tomer to whom he sells his good bushels of j
wheat, in a full round measure, he wants to be
paid in a good, full, rouutl dollar [applause
auÂ«l cries of "Good, good"], an uncorrupted
and undepreciated and never-to-be-depreciated
dollar. [Great applause ] That is what the
Republican party stands for this year. Among
many other good things, it stands for law and
order. It stands for the honor of the Govern
ment. It stands for the honest payment of
public debts. It stands for public honor and
public interest. [Tremendous cheering.]
UNION FETERING SPEIK
I General Sielcels fuwresses a Crowd of
Brit ft Â» Howler*
ST. PAUL., Minn., Sept 25.â Over 900
people pathered this evening at the
Auditorium to hear the sound-money ad
dresses of generals of the Civil War who
are. touring the country together. Gen
eral O. O. Howard was the first to appear,
and the old veteran was greeted with three
times three cheers. General Alger fol
lowed with a brief address, which was
warmly received. The great enthusiasm
of the evening centered around General
Sickels. He had hardly spoken a dozen
words when a crowd of Bryan men in the
gallery tried to howl him down. Looking
straight in the direction of the hubbub for
a minute General Sickels said in a very
loud voice:
"Will every man, woman and child in
this audience wHo is in favor of law, de
cency and sound money please stand."
At this what seemed to be 90 per cent of
the crowd jumped to their feet with a
cheer. Then General Sickels said quietly:
"Let every man who is in favor of an
archy rise." There was a dead calm for a
minute, during which nobody rose. This
was followed by the ereatest demonstra
tion of the evening, the applause lasting
several minutes.
. General Thomas Stewart followed with
a brief address, after which Corporal Tan
ner created enthusiasm by his reference to ,
the attitude of the old soldiers in this
campaign.
BISMARCK'S S ALTED BETTER.
He Hoes Xot He ply and May Aot Have
Written It at All.
NEW YORK. N. V., Sept. 25.â Prince
Bismarck'B letter to Governor Cuiberson
of Texas has caused no end of discussion
and speculation in sound money German
circles as to its authenticity. It culmi
nated on Tuesday in the calling of a meet
ing by Secretary Grosse of the executive
committee of the Sound Money League, at
wh'ch William Steinway, the chairman,
presided. After full discussion of the let
ter, it was unanimously decided that Mr.
Steinway send the iollowing cablegram to
Bismarck:
New York, H. V., Sept. 23.
To His Highness, Prince Bismarck, Friedricht
ruhe, Germany: The Silverites and Populists,
who are agitating the unlimited free coinage
of silver in this country, make use in a dema
gogical sense of the following letter alleged to
have been written by your Highness to Gov
ernor Cuiberson of Texas, especially among
the German-Americans:
"FRIEDRICHSBrHE, Aug. 24, 1896.
"Honored Sir: Your esteemed favor of July 1
has been duly received. I have always had a
predilection lor bimetallism, but I would not,
whiie in office, claim my views of the matier
to be 'nfallibly true when advanced agHlnst
the views of experts. I hold to this very hour
that it would t>e advisable to bring about
among the nation* chiefly engaged in the
world's commerce a mutual agreement in
favor of the establishment of bimetallism.
"Considered from a commercial and Indus
trial standpoint the United States are freer by
far in their movemente than any nation of
Europe, and hence shou d the peode of the
United States find it compatible with their in
terests to take independent action in the di
rection of bimetallism, 1 cannot heip but be
lieve that such action would exert a most salu
tary Influence upon the consummation of in
ternational agreement and the coming into
this league of every European Nation. Assur
ing you of my highest respect, I remain, your
most obedient servant, Bismabck."
We beg your Highness to cable us tne exact
text of your letter if the preceding text
should either not be genuine or not exact.
Full cabie reply paid.
German-American 3oukd-Monet League,
William Steinway, President.
Mr. Grosse, the secretary of the German
Sound-Money League, in referring to the
sending of the cablegram, said to a re
porter of the United Associated Presses
to-ninht:
"Although we know of Prince Bismarck
being in favor of the landed aristocracy
in Germany, which is the bimetallistic
party of that country, and which party is
constantly clamoring for special privilege-*
and high* protective tariff, and has also
been the cause of exclusion of the Ameri
can bog from Germany, we nad our
doubts that Prince Bismarck had written
a letter which by many in this country
maybe construed as an improper inter
ference with the internal politics of a for
eign Nation, and it was for this reason
that this dispatch was sent.
"We don't consider the letter in any
way misleading or hurtful to the sound
money cause, except among the ignorant,
who may accept it as an indorsement of
the unlimited free coinage of silver, which
it certainly is not. The German bimetal
lists are not in favor of the unlimited free
coinage ofCsilver for Germany, but they
will very likely have no objection â and
they may even sincerely desire â tliat the
United States should consent to the monu
mental folly and thereby secure to the
European countriesithe greatest advantage
over the United States they can desire.
We doubt whether Prince Bismarck rel
ishes the publication of the letter, and if
the letter should be genuine this may be
the reason why he has not sent any reply
so far."
BERLIN, Germany, Bept. 25.â The let
ter of Prince Bismarck to Governor Cui
berson of Texas, sent in reply to a request
of the latter to give his opinion on the
silver question, was cabfcd back to this
country and was published by the news
[ papers here. Many doubts as to the
, authenticity of the letter were expressed
by the German press, it being held by
some of them that it was a campaign
document prepared in the Unitea States
Ito aid the cause of the Silverites. In
quiries that were cabled from several dif
ferent sources from the United States
showed that considerable doubt existed
there as to whether Prince Bismarck
really entertained the opinion set forth in
the letter.
All doubt as to the authorship of the
letter is now regarded as having been set
at rest. The Hamburger Nacnnchten,
which is Prince Bismarck's orgau, has
printed Governor Culberson's letter, which
was written last June.

session of the city, and for six days thej
have simply had things tlieir own way.
To-night desperadoes made a raid on
the downtown saloons about 8 o'clock, and
held up fifteen in the very heart of the
city. To-day in broad daylight a jewelry
store was robbed of a tray containing $500

twenty robberies have been reported to
the police, who are unable to stop the
depredations. Three men have been ar
rested.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1896.
TRANSFER OF THE
FIFTH ARTILLERY
Battery F at the Presidio
Will Go to Fort
Sheridan.
A VERY DESIRABLE POST
General Ruggles Talks to the
"Call" Correspondent on the
Subject.
WHY SUCH CHANGES ARE MADE
Only Fair That the Sweets and Hard
ships Should Be Shared
Equal y
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 25.â Thb
Call correspondent saw Adjutant-General
Ruggles at the War Department to-day in
an endeavor to ascertain the transfer of
artillery batteries in detail. General Rug
gles said that thus far the batteries' de
tails had not been made. They will as
usual be made by the department com
manders in most cases instead of by the
War Department. General Ruggles said
that thus far all that had been settled was
that the Fifth Artillery was to change
places with the First Artillery, now
stationed in New York, with the excep
tion of one battery, which is at Fort Sheri
dan, Chicago.
Thb Call correspondent learned from
another source, however, that Battery F,
Fifth Artillery, Captain H. J. Reilly, is
the fortunate battery which is to be sent
to Fort Sheridan. The latter post, by rea
son of its proximity to Chicago, is con
sidered one of the most desirable in the
service.
Adjutant-General Ruggles was asked by
The Call correspondent if any statement
would be published by the War Depart
ment giving reasons for making thr- artil
lery and infantry transfers. He re
sponded:
"It is not customary for the War De
partment to publish reasons for making
such orders, as it. considers them wise and
in the best interests of the service." But
in tne course of conversation he said \
casually tnat it was customary for the ,
War Department to make transfers of j
troops at regular intervals. He said that j
the Fifth Artillery had enjoyed a good i
berth for six years on the Pacific Coast
while other regiments were obiiged to
tolerate the sandhills of Florida and the
desolate, arid plains of the Far West, and
it was only fair that each regiment should
taste the sweets of civilized life while,
those whose lots had been cast in pleasant
lines should experience some of the hard
ships of frontier life.
"But why was the order of last week
transferring the Fifth Artillery to stations
now occupied by the Third Artillery in
Florida, Fort McHenry and Washington
modified by requiring the Fifth to take
stations now occupied by the First Ar
tillery in New York and at Fort Sheri
dan?" was asked.
"After considering the matter we con
cluded that tne First Artillery should go
South rather than the Fifth, because the
latter had been stationed in tne South
since the First Artillery had been sta
tioned at these posts."
The following orders were to-day issued
by the Secretary of War:
"First Lieutenant John S. Knlp, assist
ant surgeon, will be relieved from duty at
Fort Walla Walla, Wash., by the com-
I manding officer of that post upon receipt
by him of this order, and will then report
in person to the commanding officer at
Vancouver barracks for duty at that post
and by letter to the commanding general
of the Department of the Columbia.
"8o much of special orders of Septem
{ be'r 5 from this office as relates to Captain
j William Stephnnson, assistant surgeon, is
revoked, and he will be relieved from duty
at Vancouver Barracks, Wash., by the
commanding officer of that post upon re
ceipt by him of this order, and will then
report in person to the commanding offi
cer at Fort Sheridan, 111., for duty at that
post and by letter to the commanding
general of the Department of the Mis
souri."
NA VAL SUPPLE CONTRACTS.
Heavy Purchases to Be Made by the
Paymaster- General.
NEW YORK, N. V.. Sept. 25.-A Times
special from Washington says:
Contracts will be let in a few days for
more than $100,000 worth of naval supplies
I to be delivered at the Brooklyn navy-yard.
These supplies include all the imaginable
articles which are necessary to equip the
j vessels about to go into commission,
j notably the Brooklyn, Wilmington,
I Helena and Nashville. Some of the
! material is also intended for the Dolphin.
Bids have been received from over 500
firms for supplying this material. Among
the articles are 10,000 jack-knives, which
will be sold to the sailors at the contract
price, which is 40 cents. Ordinarily the
sort of jack-knife which the specifications
call for would cost %\ at least. Tne navy
will also purchase 5000 neckerchiefs at 99
cents each. These are of black Bilk, and
are much affected by the bluejackets.
Another important item is 15,000 yards
of trouser cloth, which will probably go
to a Conshohocken, Pa., firm. A quantity
of silver boatswain calls will also oe pur
chased. These useful and necessary re
minders of the old navy cost $2 35 each.
This is one of the largest purchases ever
made at one time by Paymaster-General
Stewart, who makes the contract.
AT LINCOLN'S TOMB.
Bankers Tisit Springfield to Honor the
Martyr I'resident.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Sept. 25. â The
Bankers' Association arrived in this city
at 10:45 o'clock on a special train over the
Chicago and Alton Railroad to pay tribute
to Lincoln at his tomb in Oakridge Ceme
tery. The weather is fine. President Rob
ert Lowery of Georgia called the meeting
to order shortly after 11 o'clock. An ad
dress of welcome was delivered by Con
gressman Connolly of this city and re
sponded to by President Lowery. Ad
dresses eulogist. c of Lincoln's life and
character were delivered by E. Jd. Pullen,
ex-president of the association and Wil

Tried to Shoot Her Assail ant.
STANFORD, Kt., Sept. 25.â William
Bolton, charged with criminal assault on
Miss Lillie Blakeman, was held to the
Circuit Court by Judge Bates yesterday.
Miss Blakeman attempted to shoot Bolton
on the way to jail, but the pistol missed
fire and the woman was digarmed by the
officers. Bolton waslodeed in jail. There
is great excitement and a lynching is not
Improbable.
SENSATIONAL SUICIDE.
A Prominent Chicago Wine Merchant Turns
On the Gas and Shoots Himself
in the Head.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept 25.â A great sen
sation was produced in the business and
social circle* of this city when it was
learned that John M. Faulnaber, a wealthy
wine merchant, had made an attempt to
commit suicide and would undoubtedly
die.
Faulbaber has been well known for
many years among business men, and
great surprise was experienced at his at
tempt at self-destruction, as it was gen
erally believed that he was the possessor
of a large fortune and of a prosperous
business. His more intimate acquain
tance?, however, say that he has met with
business reverses of late, and this made
him morose and fearful of the future.
Moreover, bis domestic relations had
not been satisfactory for a long time. It
was probably a combination of these two
things that caused him to give up the
struggle.
Faulhaber evidently intended to make a
sure job of it. After retiring he closed
tbe*doors and windows of his room and
turned the gas partly on. Then with a re
volver he fired two shots into his head.
His intention evidently was that he should
be smothered with gas if the bullets proved
ineffectual.
He was disappointed in his wishes, for
he was alive when found this morning.
A strong smell of gas coming from his
room drew attention to it The door was
forced and he was found lying on the bed
unconscious, with two bullets in his head.
A-siMance was at once summoned, but
the doctors say he will not live.
A deed of assignment was Sled this
afternoon, showing that Faulhaber's assets
were only $20,000 and that his debts weie
$70,000.
WYMAN AND HAMILTON
Marine Hospital Transfers That
Cause Much Gossip at
Washington.
Hints That the Surgeon â¢ General
Wants His Predecessor Out ot
His Way.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Bept. 25.âSur
geon-General Wy man of the United States
MarinÂ« Hospital Service was seen by Thk
Call correspondent to-night and asked
why Dr. John B. Hamilton, now sta
tioned at the Marine Hospital in Chicago,
had been ordered to relieve Dr. Godfrey,
now at San Francisco, and who has been
assigned to the Chicago hospital. Dr.
Wyman said that it was usual in the
Marine Hospital Service, as in the army,
to make transfers periodically; that it had
been the custom to make these changes in
the Marine Hospital Service quadren
nially.
"Dr. Hamilton," he said, "has been
stationed at Chicago for five years, and
has therefore been there one year longer
than expected. Changes are made every
four years for the good of the service. Dr.
Hamilton is changed with the other. He
goes to a very desirable post."
An interesting bit of gossip is going the
rounds of Treasury Department circles.
They say that Surgeon-General Wyman
and Dr. Hamilton are at loggerheads and
have been for four or five years, and that
Dr. Wyman wishes to get his rival as far
away from Washington as possible. Five
years ago Dr. Hamilton was surgeon-gen
eral of marine hospitals, but resigned to
tiike a position as one of the faculty of
Rush Medical Coilege, Chicago, and to
edit a Chicago medical journal. Dr. Wy
man was appointed to succeed him.
Dr. Hamilton soon tired of his new field
of operations, however, and through the
influence of powerful friends in Washing
ton endeavored to be reinstated in his old
position as surgeon-general, to which Wy
man had been appointed. Senators Vest
and Cockrell of Missouri were good friends
of Wyman and succeeded in retaining
him in office.
Dr. Hamilton soon left Rush Medical
College and was reinstated in the Marine
Hospital Service, wich headquarters in
Chicago, and continued to publish his
paper; but, nevertheless, be has never
abandoned hope of again being surceon
general. Friends of Dr. Hamilton now in
Washington declare that in sending
Hamilton to San Francisco to relieve Dr.
Godfrey Dr. Wyman was animated by a
desire to get his rival as far away from
Washington as possible. This, however,
seems to be an injustice to Surgeon-Gen
eral Wyman.
In his conversation with The Call cor
respondent he manifested no personal
animus toward Dr. Hamilton and spoke of
him pleasantly. It is believed that Dr.
Wyman, in order not to subject himself to
the false accusation of sending Dr. Hamil
ton away irom Chicago because of personal
malice, has allowed him to remain at that
post one year longer than is usual.
It is said here that Dr. Hamilton may
resign rather than submit to what he and
the Chicago people consider an indignity.
If he should go to San Francisco he would
have to give up the editorship cf the Chi
cago Medical Journal, the income from
which is almost equal to his salary in the
United States Marino Hospital Service.
If Dr. Hamilton concludes to go to San
Francisco he will not leave until Septem
ber 30. He will be succeeded at Chicago
temporarily by Dr. P. M. Carrington. past
assistant surgeon, who will remain in
Chicago until the arrival of Dr. Godtrey,
who may be retained at San Francisco lor
several weeks in order to settle up matters
of a personal character.
Dr. Godfrey is one of the- oldest surgeons
in the service. He has been at San Fran
cisco for four years, and previous to that
was in charge of the New York City sta
tion.
Dr. Wyman reeard* him as a most ex
cellent omcer. Dr. Wyman would like to
accommodate Dr. Hamilton and those
Chicago people who are anxious for his
return, but in order to do so would have
to violate a precedent of long standing,
which might cause him trouble in future
when pressure is brought to bear to secure
the retention of some other Marine Hos
pital surgeon at a particular post.

OAKLAND'S TIDAL
CANAL DISPUTE
Dr. McLean, the Alameda
Health Officer, Is
Vanquished.
MENDEL IS OVERRULED
Colonel Suter Succeeds in Caus
ing All Work to Be
Stopped.
HE HAS CONVINCED LAMONT.
Further Operations to Cease Until
Additional Action by Congress
13 Taken.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept. 25.â At
last the raging Oakland tidal canal con
roversy has been settled and Dr. John T.
McLean, the valiant Board of Health offi
cer of Alameda, has been vanquished.
The Secretary of War has decided not to
undertake this work until the Oakland
harbor and tidal canal controversy has
been settled. Not only is Dr. McLean de
feated, for the time being at least, but
Colonel Mendel (retired), who rendered
such efficient service on the Pacific Coast
and who was a very popular engineering
officer, has been humiliated, and Colonel
Charles R. Suter, the new engineer, has
been complimented by having his recom
mendations adopted by Chief of Engineers
Craighill and {Secretary Lamont.
All of the San Francisco, Oakland and
Alameda Call readers are familiar with
the Oakland harbor improvement contro
versy. A part of the general project was
tne construction of a canal to connect San
Leandro Bay with the estuary and thus
drain and purify the city of Alameda by
carrying off at high tide its stagnant
water.
Under tbe provisions of Colonel Mendel
excavations for the canal were made at
both ends and many thousands of dollars
expended. Tnen came Colonel Suter, who
declared that it was not within the prov
nce of a general government to undertake
sanitary improvements beneficial to the
city of Alameda and who recommended
the abandonment of the canal.
Upon his return to Washington several
weeks ago Chief of Engineers Craighill
took tbe matter up for consideration. He
concluded that Colonel Suter was right,
and that the Federal Government should
not undertake sanitary improvements for
any municipality. Colonel Craighill so
expressed himself to The Call correspon
dent to-day, and at the same time ex
hibited a copy of h letter which he had
sent Secretary Lamont in reference to this
controversy. The letted is dated Septem
ber 10. After quoting tbe river and har
bor provisionb of the last session of Con
gress, which appropriated $20,000 and au
thorized an aggregate and ultimate ex
penditure of $666,000 additional under tbe
continuous contract plan, General Craig
hill refers to Colonel Suter'a report on the
Oakland harbor project and says:
"The amount required to complete the
project as given in the report of 1895 and
based upon estimates made years ago is
$741,000. A careful revision of the esti
mates, made recently by Colonel Charles
R. Suter, fixes the amount required to
complete the original project at $1,062,310.
The limit of cost for completion, namely,
(666,000, fixed by Congress, necessitates the
omission of some portion of the work con
templated in the original project. The
channel to connect the harbor with San
Leandro Bay has been partly excavated at
both ends, leaving an uncompleted por
tion in the middle. To complete the ex
cavation, build necessary bridzes and con
itruct dam and tide gates in connection
with the channel $512,000 is required.
Colonel Snter is of tbe opinion that this
portion of the work is most important to
the commercial interests of the harbor,
and that the tacts and reasons which in
duced its adoption originally were errone
dus; that there is not engineering or com
mercial necessity for prosecuting it further.
This position is indorsed by various com
mercial bodies of Oakland, but is opposed
by Alameda.
"In view of the difference of opinion it
is suggested that action looking to the let
ting of contracts for the completion of the
work be postponed until the questions at
issue can be settled, or until further Con
gressional action is secured."
The Secretary of War has approved Gen
eral Craighill's recommendations, and a
letter to that effect has been forwarded to
Colonel Suter at San Francisco.

SLASHING FREIGHT RATES.
During the War cf the Rival Eastern
Roads Shippers Will Be
Benefited.
CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 25.â The expected
demoralization of rates consequent upon
the withdrawal/from the Western Freight
Association has already begun, though in
reality there was much demoralization be
fore the crash came. To-day both the
Chicago, Great Western and the Alton
put in a rate of $2 per ton on hard coal
from Chicago to Kansas City. The Great
Western also announced a rate of $1 90
per ton to St. Paul and intermediate
points, the same rate to apply to Hamp
ton and Lyle, lowa, and intermediate
points. The old rates were $3 and $2 50 re
spectively.
The withdrawal of the Rock Island and
Banta Fe is accepted as the virtual col
lapse of the Western Freight Association
and a general reorganization is looked for.
A RELIC OF BETTER OATS.
Secor Robeson's Useless Floating Dry-
dock to Be Sold.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 25.â A Sun
special from Washington says: A relic of
the naval administration of Secretary
Robeson, a drydock costing originally
1500,000, for years has been lying at the
Pensacola Navy-yard, rusting away and
useless for any purpose. The dock was
built in four parts at Roach's old shipyard
in the early eighties and towed by two
warships to Pensacola Navy -yard, where
it was intended it should be used for dock
ing the smaller vessels of the service.
When an attempt was made to put it
together a serious defect was found, and
whether this was due to the contractors
or the designers was never ascertained.
The dock, however, proved an utter fail
ure and has lain in the navy-yard grad
ually rusting away, until now it is to be
sold by tne Government for a nominal
sum.

left the ranks and attacked the little
party.
A perfect shower of bowlders and bricks
fell on the porch, hitting the men and
crashing through the weather-boarding
and windows.
The unmounted men did what the rocks
failed to do, and when the riot was stopped
by cooler heads and the 300 or 400 men
dispersed it was found that about twenty
had been seriously injured and three â
John McKinney, D. K. Miller and Carl

CHICAGO, 111., Sept. 25.â Two robbers
late this afternoon entered the office oi
the Western Foundry Company, at thÂ«
corner of Thirty-seventh street and Albany
avenue, and holding up the cashier, M. A.
Rourke, took $1600 from the safe and es
caped. They were pursued by a crowd
which was collected by the foundry peo
ple and were in a fair way to be captured
at Thirty-sixth street and California ave
nue, but again eluded their pursuers.
At this place the hugsy in which the
men were riding broice down, and as they
were about starting to escape on foot
Frank Nyhoft, a milkman, came along.
The two men jumped into his wagon and
demanded that he vacate. On his refusing
they shot him in the leg, pitched him out
and drove away at a furious pace.
Officers from the Brighton police station
who had been apprised of the outrage were
soon on the scene and started in pursuit
of the flying robbers in a patrol wagon.
The men were lost sight of, however, but
the police, after following in the direc
tion in which they are supposed to have
fled, found, nearly two miles from the
foundry, the mils wagon, which had also
broken down. The entire Southwestern
police district was notified and a large de
tail of officers was sent out.
There were five men In the office of the
foundry when the holdup occurred. It is
claimed by one of these five men that the
robbers were former employes. One of
the robbers was fashionably dressed,
while the other was rather shabbily
dressed in a suit of brown.
The police up to a late hour had found
no trace oi the highwaymen.
Four large revolvers, one light and one
dark false beard and an old slouch hat are
locked up at the Brighton Park station.
Together with these clews the police have
at the same station the horse and buggy
used by the robbers in making their es
cape.
The location of the hold-up was an ideal
one. The foundry is far out in the ex
treme end of Brighton Park. The shop is
a one-story brick affair, fronting on Al
bany avenue, and is half a block from
Kensie avenue.
The nearest house is a saloon at Kensie
avenue. The office is a small affair about
10x10 and fronts on Albany avenue. At
the time the robbery took place there were
five men in the office. Those who were in
the office at the time the robbery was com
mitted were: D. F. O'Neil, president of
the company; M. A. Rourke, treasurer:
C. H. Hopke, general superintendpnt ;
Charles O'Gorman, clerk, and John O'Neill,
clerk.
President O'Neil sat at his desk convers
ing with Hopke. Rourke was busy mak
ing up the payrolls and tlid not see the
two men witn iong beards enter the office
through the door leading to the shop, and
the first he was aware of their presence
was when one of them called out in hoarse
voice that they shouidjhold up their hands.
The five men were ordered to stand side
by side in a corner of the office, and while
one of the disguised robbers covered them
with the revolver the other helped himself
to the money.
Both men then backed out of the office
and, jumping into their buggy, drove at a
furious rate of speed across the prairie to
Thirty-sixth street. Several shots were
fired after them, and they returned the
fire, but none of the bullets struck anybody.

SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Sept. 25.â An
audience numbering about 10,000 people
heard William J. Bryan deliver an address
half an hour long in the coart-^quare here
this afternoon. Mr. Bryan reached Spring
field at 12:05 from Hartford, where a hun
dred or more people bade nim adieu.
Stops were made at Windsor and Windsor
Locks. Thomson ville was the last stop in
Connecticut. The crowd was about equal
to that at "Windsor Locks. Mr. Bryan
spoke briefly. The first person who greeted
the candidate at tie Springfield station
â was George Fred Williams of Boston." his
former colleague in Congress, and his most
active supporter in .Massachusetts. Mr.
Bryan was cheered as he entered the
square. He was introduced by Mayor
Winter. Mr. Bryan was applauded en
thusiastically, and spoke as follows:
Ladies aatl geutl&nie:: : Before entering upon :
kcMaOQsaioa of the 'great paramount issue of
mis csinDsigu, I desire- in -this city to pay a
tribute to independent journalism! Applause.]
I respect the Springfield Republican for the'
high [great applause] plane upon which it dis- :
cusses political questions. ! respect it for the
Tolerance which it mows is political oppo- i
nents, and without censuring those who sub- j
stitute abuse for argument 1 can commend j
those who use argument instead of abuse. I
[Great applause,] I can commend, also, to
every citizen the words of that distinguished j
editor who was the founder of this paper. I j
am told that he is the author of the expression I
that a man who Is not willing to die for a cause j
he believes in is not worthy to live. [Great I
applause.]
1 challenge you to find in all political con
tests which this country hu passed through a
single contest which has aroused more earn
estness than this through which wo are now
passing. I challenge you to find among the
hosts who have defended a cause more earnest
men than I found to-day among the advocates
of the right of this Government to legislate for
itself without regard to other nations. [Great
applause.]
i; will not do to say that there is no cause
for such feeling as is manifested now. If you j
read the dispatch which appeared in yester
day morning's paper (tom London y,m will
find that a crest meeting of agriculturists
-was held in Buda-Pesth, &nd in speaking of
that meeting the dispatch *aid that practically
all oi those representing agricultural societies
were in favor of restoration oi bimetallism:
Mr friends, our opponents sometimes tell us !
that this movement In favor of free coinage 'â 
is started by the mine owners and kepi up by I
the mine owners. 1 want them to understand
that they cannot explain this great uprising [
of the peoDle on the theory that ii is in- i
stigated by a man who owns bullion and wants
to sell it at a higher price. This great upris- ',
ing comes from the mas<es of the people, who j
cio not produce bullion, but the v produce prop- i
erty and they realize that thÂ« gold standard I
has been driving value out of the property |
wnich they produce. [Applause.]
The opposition press may well afford to !
pause ia their ridicule of tte advocates of free j
coinage, in tneir denunciation of them a" law- !
less characters, to find out whether there is a
well-founded reason for this advocacy ol
bimetallism among the farmers of *.he United
Mates, of England, of Germany, of France and
of every nation which has been cursed by me
gold standard.' My friend*, 1 assert here, and
1 challenge any goldbug paper to diÂ«nntelr,
that a financial policy vrhicb. la injurious to I
the agricultural classes has nothing to com
mend it to thÂ» Government of any nation on
earth. [Applause.] The gold standard ha*
never commended itself to the agricultural
classes of any country which has ever had it.
So person can accuse me of attempting' to
deny to the financiers or even to the money
changers right to their opinion, t tie right to'
ttieir votes, the rigsu to every legitimate influ
ence. What deny to. them 'i* mis, ite ruin
to think for anybody but themselves Hie
right to act for anybody but themselves t be 1
right to put themselves above other people and
go through the : world crying. 'I am holier
than thou, 1 am liulier luan thon." [Cheers
and applause.] â 
There is one advantage In being a bimetal
list. You can like gold and silver both, while
a gold-standard mangoes not dare to like sil
ver, and he does not get much gold to like.
[Applause.] A man to!d me that out of ceariv
.^1,000,000 collected in taxes in Hartford,
Conn., leas than $I<XÂ» was collected in gold. !
Oar opponents tell us they want sound money,
Kut they want a financial' system built on the
invisible foundation. Do yon call that sound
ness, my friends, if you have got to write a new
meaning -r soundness and have soundness
denned as that which U dangerous. [Applause.]
Money ought not to be built on the talloon
pi an.
Balloons are built to go up and the higher
they go the higher they are as balloon*. and if
dollars are built on that plan the i; her they
go tha greater is the misery they bring to
mankind. [Applause.] Our opponents want
a balloon dollar. They want a dollar that gets
higher ana higher.
My friends, that is the sort of dollar that the ;
poid standard has given us. That is the sort ;
oi collar that the gold standard will continue '
to give to us. If oats get down to 10 cents a
bnsnel it means that $1 will buy ten bushel?
of oats, and if that dollar is not good enough
you can send its value up until $1 will boy
twenty bushels of oats; and if the farmer is
troubled with getting too much money lor his
oats you can still send it higher so that it ill
get 100 bushels of oat?.
When they talk of gold standard, I always
think of what Lincoln said when a man once ;
asked him. how he liked his speech, lie re
plied: "Anybody who would like that sort of
a speech would be very much pleased with it."
[Applause and laughter.) I find that the people
who like the the gold standard are very much
pleased with it, but I ant glad to say that the
number of people who like the (to.d standard
is growing less every day even in Xc England.
[Great applause and cheers.]
At the close of the" address Mr. Bryan
was taken to the Hotel Worthy for lunch
eon, followed by a running crowd of men
and boys. At 1:15 p. m. he left for "Wor
cester.
WORCESTER, Mass., Sept. 25âBe

Concerning a number of inquiries a boat
the condition of nis health Mr. Bryan said
this evening that he was feeling strong
and well, and was reducing exertion to a
minimum by resting at every opportunity.
Between stations to-day lie would lie down
in the drawing-room of his special car,
and nia!ia^'<?d to rectiuerate in tiiat way.
Mr. Bryan arrived in 80-ton at 5:87 this
afternoon. He came over the iloston ami
Albany railroad, and was met at the
station by a delegation of six membeis of
the Bryan-Sewall-Williams Club. About
IM,OOO people assembled to get a glimj>Â«Â«?
of the Democratic candidate. A great deal
of care hnd been exorcised by the ]>olice to
handle the crowd at the station. When
the train rolled in the crowd surged upon
the police and swept them away. Again
ni;.l again they made a noble stand to con
trol the crowd, but each time they were
forced up against the side of the train that
brought Mr. Bryan in.
When Mr. Bryan appeared upon the
platform oi his car there was a cheer and
a migbty rush by tho crowd. Ihe police
resorted to force, and at last pnsheu tbe
crowd baoK and made way for Mr. P.ryan
and Mr. Williams.. The candidate then
walked through the station, the crowd
yelling all the time. When he tinahv
reached the street where hi? carriage was
in waiting, the crowd cheered vociferously.
M r . Bryan quickly entered the carriage
ami was driven to* the American House-,
where after a short reception at whtes a
few members of the Bimetallic Union and
Hon. Arthur Sewall of Bath. Mp., were
present, he look luncheon with tue promi

Mr. Bryan was due to begin speaking on

' Chicago speech in German and Knsiish is
iv greater demand than any thing else.
To a reporter for the United A-sociated
â¢ Presses Mr. Hoirnan said regarding Sen
ator Hill and the New York ?iate sitna
i tion:
"I called on Senator Hill tbe day after
the Democratic State Committee meeting,
where he achieved a masterly victory in
practical politics, when the odds were big
against hub. 1 had a long interview witu
him. His programme was to have the
Sate convention at Buffalo renounce the
Chicago platform, and 1 think he could
i.aye carried it out if he had received the
support ot the theatrical and theoretical
soand-mtfbey Democratic leaders who are
less practical ia politics than tne Senator,
ami who believe ihe only way to tight the
National platform is by the third ticket.
"Coiibiaering tne souud-money Demo
crats of New York have put up such a
strong man as Gritlia for Governor it
would not surprise me to see Johu l'.oyd
Thacher withdraw irom the beau oi me
head of the Tammany ticket under tne
guidance of Hill, and to seethe Senator
throw his whole weight and inriuence wun
the Griffin ticket. 1 don't believe any oody
but Hill knows what will be bis political
move, and he is all at sea it seems to me,
but his atlitnde toward Bryan, even that
of silence, has been consistent with his
speech before the Caicajro convention and
hi? action in walking from the hat! after
tbe adoption of tne platform, in which act
I joined. I believe that Senator Hill's
course will meet with the approval ot the
Democracy of New York. It is unique,
but it is Democratic."
WEAVER'S "WOOLLY" FIGURES.
Be Sat/s Orator li-ri/nn Is Sure to Be
Elected.
CHICAGO, li.i., Sept. 85. â General
James B. Weaver of lowa came to Demo
cratic National headquarters to-day from
his State, where he has been making
speeches. He is bound for Kentucky,
where he will deliver three sr-eeches in the
central part of the State next week, and
then retnrn to lowa to remain most of tbo
time to the close of the campaign. To a
reporter of the United Associated Presses
the former nominee of ttie People's party
for President said :
"The battle is practically won, and Mr.
Bryan's election is assured. There is no
possible way in which he can be defeated.
I have beer, making very careful estimate?,
ana I am familiar with the situation in
the Slates where Mr. Bryan will get elec
toral voiÂ« There never was half the
opportunity for us to carry the State as
there is to-day.
"I will give you some figures to sup
port my assertion. la 1592 the popular
vote was: Harrison 219,000, Cleveland
196.000. Populists 20.000, Prohibitionists
COOO. The combined Democratic- Populist
vote was 2Hj,000. This, year at least 20.000
Republicans will vote for Bryan, and
transferring their vote from the Republi
can total of 219,000 to the Democrats gives
23G.000. ajraihst 199,000 for the Republi
cans. The gold Democratic defection is of
no consequence. They will not give more
than 5000 votes to McKiniey, but allowing
them 10,000, which is more than 100 to a
county, uetinct it from tbe Bryan vote and
add it to McKiniey'* vote, and they will
then nave only 209,000, against 226,000 for
Bryan. At least 6000 'broad-gaujje' Pro
hibitionists will vote for Bryan, ana since
1592 5000 Republican-Populist votes have
been added to our column. If Bryan gets
them, and be no doubv will, that wili give
him a total, of 237,000. against a possible
209,000 for McKinlev.
'â¢Tne Vice- Presidential situation is not
talked of in any way in lowa. We don't
regard it as an issue ; before the American
people. There is no ' doubt about any
state from Minnesota west to the sea."

TRAGEDY OF FOUR YEARS AGO
Tbe Killing Alleged to Have Ben
Planned by Political
Enemies.
ALBUQUERQUE, H. M., Sept. 25.â The
axecution of four desperadoes in New
Mexico yesterday recalls a tragedy in
Santa Fe four years ago, when Sheriff Cha
vez was ambushed by four men and slain.
Chavez's murderers were also sentenced
to die by the rope yesteiday, but on
Wednesday the Territorial Supreme Court
granted a rehearing, and tbe execution
was stayed. Every preparation for their
death had been made, aim it was believed
that instead ol four murderers, eigut would
hang, the ninth evil-doer whose taking off
was also to occur on Thursday, September
'2-L, having committed suicide in prison.
The granting of a rehearing gives the con
victed men another chance for lift, and a
case that has beeu fought in the courts for
years will be reopened.
At a late hour on the night of May 29,
ljvj. Sheriff Frank Chavex of Santa Fe
County was attached by several men whiie
crossing a bridge in the ancient city of
Santa Fe on his way to his home. Several
shots were tired, with fatal results. The
assailants disappeared and escaped appre
hension for two years. The primary cause
of the murder was ascribed to political
motives instigated by prominent men op
posed to the Sheriff, who wielded great
influence for his party in Santa Fe County.
Individually, Chavez was well and favora
bly connected.
A clew led to the accusation of Fran
cisco Chavez y Borrego, his brother An
tonio Gonzales, Laurence Aland and
Botnio Valencia, all of whom were re
garded as hard character?. When tbe
olbcers fell upon the accused there was a
hot tight, in which one ot the gang was
killed and the four suspects captured,
i *pou trial Valencia made a confession
implicating tUe Borrego brothers and
Alarid in the crime. Conviction resulted
ar)il the date of the execution was fixed
by the triai court. The case was appealed
and on September 1 the Supreme Cutirt
attirmed the judgment ot the lower cour;
and fixed the date oi execution. Attor
ney Cutron for defendants called the at
tention at the cvmrt on the following day
to the fact that neither tbe docket nor
record of tbe District Court showed that
the defendants were arraigned. The Su
preme Court announced suspension of
action until its sitting on adjourned day,
September 23. On that day a rehearing
was granted.
No criminal case in the history of the
Territory has attracted more attention
than this one owing to the political con
nections brong.u into it, it being charged
that one of the defendants' attorneys was
instigator of the crime. Governor Thorn
ton in an ot>en letter accused Catron, and
the latter, in like form, made positive de
nial. Last fall the defendants attorneys,
Spies and Catron. ware before the Supreme
Court charged with complicity in the
crime. Tlie charges were refuted and
Catron, at art adjourned meeting of tbe
Bar Association, was chosen as its presi
dent.
Editor Thomas Hughes of the Albu
querque CiDzen, lor the publication of a
iengmy article in his paper condemning
Chief Justice Smith for alleged attempt to
connive with Attorney Chiiders, in this
city, to defeat justice in the case of Spies
and Catron, was committed for contempt

prisonment of sixty days in tbe Bernalillo
County Jail, which sentence was duly exe
cuted.

Outlaw Dan IJcCall was killed, is now in ;
the hands of a jury. â¢ Since noon the

guilt or innocence have been studying the
problem before them, and there is no likeli
hood of a verdict being reached before

Attorney If, E. Power made the closing
argument for i tlie pposecution this fore
noon. After replying. to the aspersions
cast by the defendant's counsel on certain
witnesses for the prosecution, be showed
that the alleged accomplices who had been
sworn were fully corroborated by the facts
and circumstances of the case, and he
contrasted the character of witnesses ior
the prosecution with those for the defense.
After begging the jury to remember that
this was a crime against every man,
woman and child in the State who traveled
over any. railway, against the wounded
officers who â¢ bravely risked their lives in
defense of law and order, he 'closed by j
reminding it ' that the Southern Pacific
Company was not and could not be a
factor in the case, and â¢ that prejudice
against the railroad ehould not sway its
judgment.

A press dispatch from Oberlin, Ohio,
conveys the interesting intelligence tbat
Miss Alice Price, formerly an Oberlin stu
dent, and Henry C. Fritcher of Los An
geles, Cal., have eloped from Oberlin.
Miss Price, who is but 17 years old, was
visiting her aunt, Mrs. Wood, at Oberlin.
She is a beautiful girl. Her parents are
mi^ionaries in the Micronesian Islands.
They are so many thousands of miles
away that they can only communicate
with their daughter at intervals' of many
months.
The e-room i? 22 years old. He says that
his father is a wealthy business man. The
couole disappeared last nignt, and after
they were safely out of reach Mrs. Wood
received a letter from young Fritcher in
whicb he said:
We will be by the time you receive this mar-
Btd, either in Cleveland or Detroit.
Tbe surprising information created a
sensation here, where the young couDle are
well known. The yonng lady is the
daughter of P.ev. ilr. Price, w'no, up to
fifteen months ago. was pasfor of Beth
lehem Church, at the corner of Vignesand
Lazard streets, this city, and who is now
with his wife in the far-off Micronesian
Islands doing missionary work. The other
principal in the elopement ia Henry C.
Fritcher, whose borne Â» in Los Angeles
and whose father, John S. Fritcher, is an
employe of the Southern California Rail
road, residing at 17 South Grand avenue.
The elder Fritcher said to-day:
"Henry has been in the East about a
year, his home being in Chicago. He
worked for the Adams Express Company
until a month ago, when he started on a
political trip. He was to ride to Canton,
Ohio, with a message for Major McKinley.
I received a letter from him while he was
in Cleveland, in which he said it was rain
ing so hard be could not leave Cleveland.
Oberlin is right on his way to Canton, and
he said be intended to stop there and
make a visit. He was acquainted tn Chi
cago with the young woman whom he
eloped with. 1 thought they were too
young to be married; would as soon
bftve thought of an alliance of babes."

Los Angeles, Cal., Sept. 25.)
The field of woman's work in the Meth
odist Episcopal church is widening day by
day. Another victory in behalf of the fair
sex was secured in the Southern Califor
nia Conference to-day by a signal majority.
i The question of admitting women as lay
delegates to the general conference of the
denomination had been under considera
tion for years. This question, it will be
remembered, almost caused a split in the
late general conference at Cleveland, Ohio,
after one of the most spirited discussions
that ever took place in a religious body.
The long debate ended favorably, by a
clo?e vote to the admission of women.
Before the action could be put into effect
it was deemed necessary to secure the con
currence of the annual conferences, wliich
meet throughout the country, so the ques
tion was referred to them for decision.
The measure had to be passed by a two
thirds vote of the general conference,
whiie a three-fourths vote of all those cast
by the annual conferences is required.
The Southern California Conference voted
on the question to-day and declared in
I lavor of the women by 79 to 24, which is
five votes over the necessary three-fourths.
Another matter of similar character
which waspassed on to-day was that of
admitting laymen in equal number with
the ministers to the general conference.
This had also been before the general con
ference at Cleveland and received its com.
I mentation, but was referred to the annual
conferences. The vote this morning stood
77 for and 23 against tne measure.
Three young musters were admitted to
; the conference. They are John Nicholson
of Escondido, W. L." Miller of Hanford
and \V. S. (Veen of Creston.
Bishop Foss delivered the annual ad
dress.
The following visitors from other con
ferences were introduced: Bishop Games
of the African Methodist church. Rev. W,
D. McMillin oi Puget Sound, K. T. Bald
win of the Oregon conference and Miss
Spaulding, the superintendent of tbe local
Deaconess' Home.
A committee was appointed to examine
into the matter of rendering aid to fami
lies of deceased ministers. It was decided
that Rev. E^A. Healey should address the
conference to-morrow on the legislative
feature of this fund as discussed by the
general conference. Another committee
was appointed to consider the proposition
of moving the North Pasadena church
further into the town.

of the session was tbe special exhibit of
dairy products of this part of the State for
the benefit of Major Alvord. Cheese,
evaporated cream and butter were among
the articles shown. Major Alvord passed

sion in the afternoon, and then they were
donated to the Orphans' Home.
Mr. Smither delivered an address of
I welcome, to which Major Alvord re-
I sponded. "Dairy Associations" was the
I title of the first paper, wh^ch was read by
C. H. Sessions. He spoke of the work of

for its further support. He referred to
tuberculosis, and said be favored the
passage of a bill which would remunerate
I people who Lad lost stock by complying
with the requirements of the law in kilt
ing diseased animals, iiajor Alvord led
tne discussion that followed, and made a
j very significant statement, to tne effect
that tne dairy output in this State repre
; sented $15,000,000 annually.

SPOKAND'S COMPLAINT.
Final Arguments Bttgun in the Freight-
Hate Terminal Case.
PORTLAND, Ob., Sept 25.-Special
Master in Chancery Sawyer of San Fran
cisco to-day began tbe final arguments in
the freight-rate terminal case brought by
the Spokane Shippers' Association against
the Northern Pacific Railway. Attorney
Graves, representing the complainants,
made the opening argument, and during
tbe day the massive volumes of evidence
taken in San Francisco, Portland, Seattle,
Tacoma and Spokane were reviewed. An
other day may be consumed iv arguments.
The long-drawn-out contention relates
to discrimination in rates, which it is
cbarged the railroad company has been
giving Portland and Puget Sound cities
the benefit of in violation of the acts of
the Commerce Commission. Attorney
Graves argued that rates for Spokane
shippers were exorbitant, and he showed
by many facts and figures that a through
rate of less than $18 per ton to the coast
terminals, and of nearly $30 per ton to
Spokane from Eastern points was unjust,
in view of the distance between Spokane
and the coast cities. He contended that
the complainants were entitled to reduc
tion in class and commodity rates, irre
spective of water competition.
The defense argued Jby Counselor Bunn
is that Spokane is an inland, not a seaport,
town, and tnat by reason of sharp water
competition the railroad company must
maia its terminal rates lower than to in
termediate points.

AT SACRAMENTO
Converts to Republicanism
Made at a Political
Rally.
TWO TELLING SPEECHES
â¢ D. A. McKinlay and Ex-Mayor
Davis of Oakland the
Orators.
LABOKERS LISTEN AND CHEER.
Many Who Were "on the Fence' 1
Ciimb Down on the Side of
Protection.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Sept 25.-Amid
the bursting of rockets and blare of brass
bands the Republicans of Sacramento fired
the opening gun oi the campaign and
lighted the torch of patriotism, which for
the past month had been smoldering be
neath the work of preparation. With but
a few hours' notice Metropolitan Theater
was crowded from pit to gallery with an
audience composed in the main of the
thinking laboring classes of this vicinity
men whose daily bread depends upon the
labor of their hands and who, feeling that
upon the issue of this campaign depends
the ability to procure the labor with which
to gain that bread, have made up their
minds to listen attentively to the argu
ments presented by the speakers of each
of the great parties and judge with cool,
unbiased common-sense under which
standard it will be to their greatest ad
vantage to enlist. Through the assem
blage were scattered a number of women.
When D. A. McKinlay was introduced
by Chairman Davis to-night, he faced an
audience distinctively "on the fence."
When Speaker McKinlay took his seat at
the conclusion of his eloquent speech,
that audience had cheered itself hoarse
and was wildly enthusiastic for Republi
canism, McKinley and protection. McKin
lay is a convincing speaker, who not only
utters incontrovertible truths, but ex
presses them in such manner that they
can be thoroughly understood and appre
ciated by all. He-exemplified to the work
ing classes that he was on the rostrum in
the interests of the working classes. In
concluding his soeech he reviewed the at
tribute* of the two Presidential candidates,
and in speaking of Bryan, said :
"He is claimed by the Democrats to be
the coming nian ."
A burst of cheers from a few silverites
present interrupted the speaker, who stood
calmly until silence was restored, and then
in an impressive voice said:
"My Democratic hearers, four years ago
you cheered even more wildly for Grover
Cleveland, who was then to you ihe com
ing manâ Grover Cleveland, who became
ihe Colossus of Rhodes of Democratic pol
itics, so mighty that his limbs stretched
from ocean to ocean across oflr land, and
all other poor mortal 3 were compelled to
peep between his mignty legs to catch a
glimpse of the outside world â and yet a
few brief weeks since at the Democratic
convention there were none so poor as to
do him reverence, and he was utterly re
pudiated. May not such be the fate of
your coming man?"
He paused and for a moment the pro
verbial pin could have been heard to fall.
Then arose a burst of applause that fairly
rocked the building, and when he spoke of
McKinley and his career from the time of
shouldering his musket in the cause of
emancipation to his proof of eminent
statesmanship in the hails of Congress, and
said McKiniey's name would stand high
in the annals of this country when Bryan's
had sunk into oblivion, his voice was
drowned by volleys on volleys of wild
applause. Those cheers proved that he
had induced those of his hearers who had
been "on the fence" to enlist beneath the
Republican banner.
McKkilay was followed by ex-Mayor W.
R. Davis of Oakland, who quietly dis
sected the orator of the Platte and snowed
him up in all his weakness, and then held
up in strong relief the magnificent Repub
lican candidate, who for years had proved
his eminence as a lawyer, statesman and
the father of protection. He vividly com
pared the failures of the Democratic ad
ministration â which in four short years
had plunged the country into debt, par
alyzed the avenues of industry and trade
and thrown thousands of the laborini;
classes out of employmentâ with the
splendid record of over thirty years of Re
publican administration, of plenty and
prosperity. For upward of two hours he
held his audience spellbound with his elo
quence and satire.
MISS SHAW SPEAKS AT UKIAH.
Why Voters of ill Parties Should Favor
Jiqual Suffrage.
UKIAH. Cal., Sept. 25.â Rev. Anna
Shaw spoke here last evening to a large
audience on the woman suffrage amend
ment to be voted on at the next election.
The house was crowded, the men being in
the majority. The stage was tastily deco
rated and, with a large number of hand
some women on it, presented a pretty
sight. Mrs. Jennie Macmillan presided
and introduced Miss Shaw.
During her remarks the speaker showed
wherein any man, a member of any politi
cal party, would be inconsistent should be
vote against the proposed amendment.
The Republican party, she said, bad in
corporated a plank favoring equal suf
frage in its Btate and National platforms.
Farther, as a firm believer in protection to
everything American, it was the duty, she
said, of every Republican not only to pro
tect the products of America but also the
women of America.
As reasons why every consistent Demo
crat and Populist should favor the amend
ment, she quoted their respective mottoes;
that of the Democratic party, "It is the
right of every individual to have a voice
in the government," and that of the Popu
ulist party, "Equal rights to all, special priv
ileges to none. 1 ' Every Nationalist should
exert his influence in favor of the amend
ment, she claimed, because it was the
woman suffrage question that caused the
breach in the .Prohibition' party which
subsequently resulted in the organization
of the Nationalists.
MONTEREY COUNTY POLITICS.
Propose* Attempt to Pledge Representa
tives to Free Coinage.
PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Sept. 25.â
Probably the hottest fight in any conven
tion ever held in the history of Monterey
County will be on to-morrow in Salinas,
the county seat, at the Republican County
Convention. A few days ago W. A. Kear
ney of the First Ward in Salinas got him
self and friends elected delegates, defeat
ing the regular ticket It was a great
surprise to all that he should desire a seat
in the convection after announcing him
self as a independent candidate for joint
Senator, but i". now turns out that he will
try to introduce a resolution that, if car-

FUSION FAILS AT FALL CITY. Z
Democrat* Refuse to Aid the White- Cator
Senatorial Scheme.
REDDING, Cal., Sept, 25âThe Demo
cratic Joint Assembly Convention of
Modoc and Shasta counties, which ended
its duties at 2 o'clock this morning after a
stormy -night's session, concluded its
labors at Fall City by nominating for
Assemblyman in this district Jewett
Scranton of Shasta. A fight ensued as to
whether a straight-out Democrat would
be nominated or a Populist indorsed. The
straight-out Democrats finally achieved a
victory, and Scranton received the nomi
nation. The majority of the Populists
and all of the Democrats will support
Scranton. The PoDulist convention,
which meets on the 28th, may place
another man in the field.
3ffÂ«* Shaw at San.a Ilnsa.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Sept. 25.-Ridge
way Hall was filled to-night, when the
Rev. Anna Shaw appeared on the plat
form to address those assembled on equal
suffrage. The eminent suffragist was un
sparing in her comments upon masculine
inconsistencies, and created much amuse
ment by her witty sallies. The audience
was largely composed of women, and the
speaker seemed to echo the sentiments of
most of those present. She declared that the
only issue of this or any other campaign
was being lost sight of by the masculine
politicians, and that ttie time would soon
come when the rights of her sex would be
an issue too large to be overlooked.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1896.
SAN JOSE SLAYER
DOOMED TO DIE
Harvey Allender Sentenced
to Be Hanged at
San Quentin.
RESIGNED TO HIS FATE.
Declares He Desires to Join the
Woman Whose Life He
Ended.
WANTS NO APPEAL TAKEN.
Judge Lorigan Names December n as
the Date for the Murderer's
Execution.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Bept. 25.â Harvey
Allender, who killed Miss Walburga Feil
ner and Venanz Crosetti on Sunday after
noon, August 9, was this morning sen
tenced to. be hanged at San Quentin prison
on Friday, December 11, for the murder of
the former. Allender took his sentence
coolly. The courtroom was crowded with
.spectators. When sentence was pro
nounced there was some applause, but
this was quickly quieted by the court.
On the calling of the case Attorney
Morehouse made a motion for a new trial,
on the grounds that the court had erred
and misdirected the jury in matters of
law and that the burden of proof of insan
ity was shifted from the prosecution tc the
defendant, who was required to establish
insanity by a preponderance of evidence â
an incorrect rule of law. Judge Lorigan
denied the motion. Allender was then
tola to stand up and receive bit sentence.
Allender says he is reconciled to his
fate, and has requested his attorney not to
appeal the case. He says that when he is
dead he will be with the eirl, and that is
all he desires. He will be taken to San
Quentin in a day or two, nnless an appeal
is taken, which is not likely.

May 15, 189G, while in the employ of the
telephone company.
Saltzman was employed as a lineman,
and on May 15 was engaged in stringing
wires along South First street. Wni c ad
justing the wires on a pole at the corner-of
First and Fernando streets he camu into
coutact with a cross wire of the First-street
electric railway, which was attached to
the pole. He received a shock and was
thrown violently to the ground. Both of
his kneecaps were broken, his spine hurt,
and the injuries, he alleges, confined him
to his bed for eleven weeks. The com
plaint alleges that the accident was due to
negligence on the part of the two com
panies in allowing a live wire to be fas
tened to the telephone pole. The sum of
$1000 is also asked to cover the exoe'^e of
medical attendance, making a total of
$51,000 sued for.

H. Parker, deceased, admitted on cross-
examination to-day that she had never

PACIFIC GROVE, Cal., Sept. 25.â
Populist-Democrats of the City Among
the - Pines were called out to-night en
masse to listen to E. E. Cothran, a lawyer
of San Jose, who spoke on the issues of the
present campaign. Cothran failed to gain
many converts to his side of the question.
The meeting, however, was thoroughly
aroused when at the last moment Edward
Berwick of Monterey, a strong gold man,
accepted the challenge of Cothran to come
to the â¢ platform and debate on â¢ the , main
issue before. the public. Cothran led off
with a fifteen' minutes' talk. His points
Berwick attacked and in a masterly
manner set forth the fallacies of his
opponents' argument and doubly strength
ened his own aide of the debate by pre
senting numerous statistics i and quoting
from many well-known authorities. After
the first round the < speaker took - terms of
ten minutes each, consuming in all about
an â¢ hour and a half. ; The audience was
decidedly in . favor ;of the argument pre

SHARTS MAY NOT LOSE.
County Treasurer Jankgon Repays a
Portion of Hi* Shortage.
REDDING, Cal., Sept. 25.â The short
age of County Treasurer Jackson is now
known to be $26,000. The defaulting
Treasurer has within the past day re
placed $4800 of that amount. This money
he derived from the sale of mining stocks
in the San Francisco market. It is sup
posed Jackson's brother will make the
balance of the shortage good or that Jack
son himself will devise some way of raising
the money, else he would not have re
placed the amount he did to-day.
It is believed the bondsmen will not
prosecute Jackson. That will be left for
the Grand Jury and Supervisors to do.
The Grand Jury will undoubtedly indict
Jackson, and may instruct the District
Attorney to prosecute him, even though
he should settle the deficiency in full.
At their next meeting the Supervisors
will appoint Jackson's successor to the
office of Treasurer. Already tnere is quite
a scramble for the appointment. C. C.
Bush Jr., cashier of the Bank of Shasta
County, has been appointed Deputy Treas
urer, and until the new Treasurer it ap
pointed Bush will act.

EL PALOMA BELEAGURED
Bloodthirsty Papago Indians
Threaten to Attack the
Town.
Mexican Troops Dispatched From
Hermosillo to the Assistance of
the Inhabitants.
NOGALEB, Ariz., Sept. 25.âInforma
tion from El Paloma, a mining camp in
Sonora, about fifty miles southwest of
Nogales, conveys the intelligence that the
town is beleaguereti by Papago Indian*,
and the Mexican authorities at Hermosillo
have been applied to for military assist
ance.
It is stated that the Papagoes have been
holding a feast of some days' duration in
the vicinity of El Paionia and have killed
a number of cattle belonging to stockmen
residing there. An attempt was made to
arrest some of the offending Indians, who
resisted.
The posse retreated to El Paloma, se
cured re-enforcements and returned to the
scene of the trouble. A second time the
Papagoes drove them back to El Paloma.
A third attempt resulted in the arrest of
four Indians and their incarceration in the
jail at the camp.
To rescue the prisoners, 200 armed
Papagoes have surrounded the camp
and threaten to attack. As they
were approaching, a courier was has
tened to Santa Ana, seventy- five miles
away, the nearest place on the
Sonora Railway accessible by road, who
wired to Hermosiilo for troops. This
morning Colonel Kosterlitsky, with a
troop of the gendarmerie, was started from
Nogales for the scene of the trouble.
"BONNY CLABBER."
jHaB_a_rinrorjrhat Will Excite the Anon-
tite of Epicures.
In spite of the prejudice that little Miss
Muffet's misfortunes may have excited in
the younger members of the community a
disn of "curds and whey" is not to be de
spised. Eaten as it should be, with the
freshest and ripest of berries and the dain
tiest of rusks, tt has a pastoral flavor that
will entice the appetite of the ennuied bon
vivant, says a contributor to Cooking.
Under the name of "bonny clabber"
this is a favorite Southern dish. It is not
merely "clabbered" milk, but milk left to
stand just long enough to become jellied
before the whey has separated from the
curd. The process may be hastened by
rennet, when it is known aa "rennet cuk
tard," or it may be kept ju9t to the point
where the heat of the atmosphere turns it
to a firm jelly. The result is practically
the same. At the South "bonny clabber"
is seldom sweetened, but is served with
plenty of sugar and grated nutmeg strewn
over it.
Rennet custard, on the contrary, is
usually sweetened and flavored with wine.
Put half a teaspoonful of rennet in a quart
of milk fresh from the milking or heated
to 100 degrees. Add about five table
spoonfuls of sugar and two of Madeira.
Stir the milk thoroughly and let it stand
in a warm place for twelve hours or until
it hardens. It must be set in the dish it is
to be served in. Some housekeepers pre
fer to serve it in individual cuds. As soon
as it is a firm jelly it should be set on the
ice.
No dessert is more wholesome. It is an
admirable dish for the children's supper
table, and for this purpose the wine should
be omitted. The snowy little mounds
should be turned out of the small cups in
which they were set and dredged with
sugar. A candied cherry cut in fine bits
and scattered over each one will make
this simple dish acceptable to almost any
child. A rennet custard or any kind of
curds and whey should be served as soon
as possible after it is formed and been
chilled. Strawberriea are especially nice
with *^>onny claober," which is served
with sweetened cream.
A Tree With a History.
A Norridgewock (Me.) farmer enter
tainee 100 friends the other day, the table
for the collation beine set under a willow
trea whicii has an interesting story. The
day atter President Lincoln was assassi
nated the farmer chanced to be three miles
from home, and to assist him in his walk
across lots cut a willow linib, which be
used for a cane. As he climbed the fence
into his yard he stuck the "cane" into the
ground, top end down, it took root and
grew as willows often do, and to-day is a
large tree, covering a space fifty-two feet
in diameter.

LITERARY WORK.
The Enormous Price Paid for a Few
Books. Â»
The Century Company paid $50,000 for
the "Life of Lincoln." It is no disparage
ment to the authors of the Century's life
of Lincoln to say that theirs was a freak
price. The authors had information for
Bale that no one else possessed. They had
a corner on facts about Abraham Lincoln,
and the public demand for these facts was
so great that a high price would have been
paid for them, even if told much less grace
fully than the authors told them. The mo
tive of the Century Company in giving
$50,000 for this beat was precisely that of
any enterprising newspaper in buying ex
clusive news. It is not by any means an
unheard of occurrence that the managing
editor of a newspaper should pay $100 for
ten words of information and then spend
as much more in sending reporters to ver
ify the facts and "get all there is of it."
Of course, there is nothing in either the
$50,000 check or the $100 in cash to indi
cate the market value of literature, and
yet a certain club of literary men in this
town has framed and hung up the check
which the Grants received for the life of
Qeneral Grant, as if the amount paid was
in some way the full limit of prices for a
literary product-
Scott got $40,000 for "Woodstock," while
Moore got 3000 guineas for "LallaÃookh."
Anthony TrolJope received in all $350,000
for his various works. Dryden got Â£1200
for "Virgil." Tom Moore got Â£15,000 for
his Irish melodies. George Eliot did not
get less than Â£8000 for any of her novels,
and one brought Â£15,000, it is said,
Robert Bonner of tr,e Ledger paid
Charles Dickens $5000 for "Hunted
Down," a story of 7000 words. It is cur
rently reported that Charles Scribner's
Sons paid $25,000 for "Sentimental
Tommy," which is now running through
their magazine. Arthur Scribner, when
asked about this rumor and a further
rumor that a bargain at $50,000 had been
made for the next story by the same au
thor, declined either to affirm or deny.
The great success of "Sentimental Tom
my" probably originated an exaggerated
rumor.
It is the common rule of publishersâ and
it is a rule that is particularly rasping to
the writer with any instinct of an artist in
himâ to pay by the yard, at least by the
thousand words. It was with this rule in
view that the fact of Charle3 Dickens re
ceiving $5000 for 7000 words was mentioned.
Anthony Hope refused, not long ago, an
offer of $750 for a short story. Here is an
other gauge of market rates, for "a short
story" means from 3000 to 4000 words. It
is fair to Mr. Hope to say that he waa
priced at $200 a thousand words.
That gives us the first intimation that
the market is rising, for something less
than three years ago (October, 1893) Mr.
Howells wrote that three American men
were commonly paid at the rate of $100 a
thousand words for their contributions to
the magazines, while one woman received
$150. Nationality has nothing to do with
prices, of course, so the inference is that
the market for strictly first-class writers of
magazine stories has hardened to the ex
tent of at least 33% per cent.â New York

The First Screw Collier.
The old John Bowes, forever famous as
the first screw collier, and the pioneer of
the new order of things in the coal trade,
has just been sold to a Dublin owner. The
John Bowes was built as far back a. 1852,
and has not only the distinction of being
the pioneer screw collier, but she was the
first vessel turned out of the noted Jarrow
shipyard by Sir Charles Mark Palmer, and

ELECTRIC SHOOK VICTIMS.
A French Authority Prescribes a Form-
ula of Treatment.
One of the contingencies of modern civil
ization which is almost entirely new, and
is wholly dependent upon the develop
ment of modern industry is the treatment
of accidents from electric shocks, says the
Medical Record.
The matter has been discussed quite
thoroughly by physicians in this country,
but it has been worked out perhaps more
systematically by Dr. D' Arson vai of Paris,
who has recently made a report to the
Academic de Medicine of Paris upon the
method 6f treating persons injured by
electrical shocks. D'Arsonval states that
electricity causes death sometimes directly
by the disruptive and electrolytic effects
ot" the charge on the tissues. This death
is final. It sometimes, However, causes
death indirectly by arrest of respiration
and syncope, caused by stimulation of the
nerve centers. Under'these circumstances
a person may be revived if proper meas
ures are applied.
The formula for reviving the victim of
electric shock is this: The person so dis
abled bhould be treated like one drowned;
in other words, he should be laid upon the
back and artificial respiration performed
In the way that is ordinarily prescribed.
Some further practical advice, however, is
given to those who are called at once to
the scene of the accident and at the time
when the peruon is perhaps still in contact
with the wires. Of course, the nrst thing
to be done is to stop the current or break
tlie contact.
In doing the latter one should not touch
the victim on the face or handa or any
naked part of the body. It is better to lilt
him by the coat-tails or lo throw a blanket
over him, and pull nim by this. Nothing
that is wet should be thrown upon him,
and if his clothes are wet the hands should
not be put in contact with them. A piece
of dry wood can be Dlaced under the body
and he can then be lilted. The further
treatment of the case is the familiar one
applied in attempting to restore the
drowned. The arms are worked and the
tongue is kept drawn out; tiio body may
sometimes be rubbed thorouchly with a
clotn or brush in order to increase the cir
culation of the blood. Oxygen and per
haps a stimulant may be employed.

San Francisco, Cal.,

I, Mrs. Agnes Feely, living at

desire to say that I brought my
child, Agnes, aged 12 years, to
the office of ' Dr. F. L' Sweany,
737 Market street, S. F., she
being afflicted with a malady of
the right' eye. I had previously
taken her to our family doctor,
who said he was at a loss to say
what the precise trouble was, or
how to remedy it. Doctor
Sweany at once stated my
child's case to be one of kera-
titis. My child was totally blind
in that eye at the first visit,
September 18, 1896. Now, on
September 25, she can see per-
fectly out of the eye. I heartily
appreciate the rapid cure of this
serious eye affection, a great
matter for a child anxious to
pursue school studies, and I
have offered to testify this much
on behalf of \ kindness and skill
so effectively rendered by Dr.
Sweany.

Harmony is the result of well-ordered
regularity in politics as in music.
Silver monometallism means a panic,

A united Republican vote means victory

If Republican reenlarity is to be set

every year?
Charles L. Taylor and a board of Repub

To bolt the Republican ticket is to aid
in the election of either a Buckley or a
Rainey Democrat.
Sewall and Watson act on the Popocrat
fusion like a couple of boils, and there is
no way of getting used to them.
In making their selection for Mayor the
Non-Partisans were decidedly premature
and many of them already regret it.
There is room in the Republican proces
sion for every bolter who feels like coming
back and keeping step with the music
Don't fail to get The Sunday Call and
read what the professors of t;.e great uni
versities of the country think oi the money
question.
Bryan's trip to New England is a little
less absurd than the ordinary wild goose
chase inasmuch as it is a wild gander that
is doing the cba-ing.
To give protection to industry ana work
to labor is tbe pressing need of the time,
and no issue before thÂ« country is more
important than that.
If the Fourth Congressional Committee
can call a county convention why couldn't
that of the Fifth District do the same
thing if it felt like it?
No man would like to be paid in dollars
of uncertain value and therefore no man
should vote for a party whose success
would make the dollar uncertain.
The silver men of Colorado are coming
to the support of Senator Wolcott and
will stand for protection and bimetallism
against free trade and the free silver craze.
McKinley described the issue before the
country very accurately as a choice be
tween right and wrong, and that is the way
the people are beginning to understand it.
The Yale men were not polite to Bryan,
but it must be remembered the opportu
nity for making a match between the cam
paign roorback and the college yell was
very tempting.
The price of silver is not rising and that
is a sign that no one has confidence in
Bryanism. Gold is coming into the coun
try and that is a sign every one has confi
dence in McKinley.
The silence of the Democrats on the
question of electing Cator to the United
States Senate may mean consent, and then
ngain it may mean a lack of language ade
quate to the subject.
The inconsistency of the Examiner on
tbe silver question could not have oeen
exceeded if the editorial policy had Deen
the discordant production of a whole
beard of examiners.
Why should any Repu blican of San Fran
cisco leave the party organization at this
time? "Was organized effort ever more
needed than now? Is there anything to
be gained by disorganization?
The convention called by the Republi
can County Committee represents the Re
publican organization of San Francisco,
and those who refuse to support the ticket
It nominates have no right to call them
selves Republicans.
In preparing for its forthcoming silver
edition the Examiner will have a good op
portunity to show the evolution of a Rold
bug through the straddlebag to the hum
bus, and furthermore it can mate the
hhowing without extra cost by simply re
publishing a series of its own editorials
for the last three years.
HARMONY AND ORGANIZATION.
Among earnest Republicans of this City
there is a consciousness of the need of
party harmony and party organization to
achieve victory in the coming election.
Even in this Republican year success can
not be attained by a divided vote in Ban
Francisco. Harmony and organization
are therefore necessary. The party must
act through its regularly constituted
forms and methods, and harmony must
come from a loyal and unwavering sup
port of its established authority.
The Auditorium convention represents
the organized Republicanism of San Fran
cisco. It has assembled under the call ot
the Republican County Central Committee
and- must therefore be recognized as the
only authorized representative of the rank
and file of the party. If tnere is to be con
tinued in San Francisco a Republican
county organization it must be continued
through that convention. Tho line of
succession has been unbroken in the past
and must go forward unbroken to the
future.
Harmony never can be attained at the
expense of organization. If, for the Bake
of satisfying men who are opposed to the
regular authorities of the party, those
authorities are set aside, then a reward ia
offered to encourage factions, and party
loyalty is sacrificed to party treason. How
long could a political party exist as a
potent factor in American politics if it
were unorganized? How long could its
organization continue if the regularity of
its proceedings were interrupted at every
election? How could it ever have a recog
nized platform, or candidate, if conven
tions called by other than the constituted
authority were permitted to come together
in its name and attempt to act as its
representative?
The only way to establish harmony is to
revive that party loyalty which stands
steadfast and firm for the party organiza
tion. The regular convention of the party
must be recognized as the only conven
tion of the party. If any considerable
number of Republicans should be en
couraged to break away from tbe support
they owe to the convention of
tne party then disorganization would
at once ensue and factions would
go on from year to year to weaken
the party in every contest. In the
practical affairs of politics it is absurd to
ta:k of promoting harmony by setting
aside organization. They are one and in
separable. The ioyal Republicans of San
Francisco must stand firmly for regularity
and the preservation of tbe unbroken
unity and continuity of its organism.
That unity and continuity is now centered
in the Auditorium convention, and to that
body we must look for the only harmony
which can win in politics â the harmony of
organized effort.
Consider, my fellou-citizens, the advance
ment we made between 1330 and 1890, and
driring those years we never had free trade
nor free silver. The marvelous progress of
the country between ISSO and 1890 is worthg
the study of all American citizens. It is the
best answer to the oft-repeated but fallacious
statement that the country had been suffering
from the effect of the act of 1873, which
stopped the free coinage of silver. It is an
unanstcerable argument for the restoration of
a protective tariff and the maintenance of
sound money. â McKinley.
REPUBLICAN HELP WANTED.
The American, a Bryan journal printed
in Philadelphia, whose editor, Wbar
ton Barker, bad hopes that the Chi
cago convention would have the good
sense to nominate him for President, says
in its current issue: "A crisis confronts
the Democratic committee in their can
vass, a crisis that must be met, for Repnb
can votes must be won, and they can be
won only through Republicans." Mr.
Barker is quite right. A crisis certainly
does confront the Bryanites, and it. is
equally true a great many Republican
votes will have to be won for Bryan to se
cure his election, but who in the Republi
can party is insane enough to undertake
the job of winning men who have stood
for protection, good money and prosper
ity all their lives over to the Bupport of
free trade, foreign cheap iabor schedules
and silver monometallism?
Editor Barter does not seem to be ac
quainted with tbe kind of material Repub
licans are made of. But he is honest, else
he never would admit that Bryan cannot
reach tbe White House unless Republi
cans give him a boost, and since Republi
cans are already committed t'u McKinley
on principle, the outlook for them to go to
work for bis defeat cannot be said to be
encouragine. That a crisis confronts the
Bryanites there is no doubt whatever, and
if public opinion keeps on solidifying
against their free-trade policy, by Novem
ber the crisis will resemble a cyclone.
It is not exactly impudence in Editor
Barker to intimate that Republicans can
be found who would leave their own party
and espouse the cause of a candidate who
Btands for everything tbe Republican
party has been battling aeainst all its life,
viz.: whatever is calculated to destroy the
credit and reflect upon the glory of the
United States, for he as well as all the
other Bryan leaders are in desperate
straits, and, like a drowning man, they
grab at even shadows of straws. But the
Democratic committee will have to hunt
elsewhere than in the ranks of the Repub
lican party for help, for no one could be
found among the supporters of a policy
that will give the country prosperity who
would deliberately assist to bring even
greater distress upon the people than the
\Vilson-Gorman act afflicted them with.
It is no doubt true, however, that unless
Bryan can secure a large army of Repub
lican votersâ unless Republicans can be
"won" over to him â his chances for elec
tion will be as one to a million.
One of the Government officials connected
with the Agricultural Department says the
consumption of wheat has fallen off 25 per
cent in this country on account of the hard
times. If an essential like that loses S5 per
cent of its consumption it goes a good ways
toward explaining why the farmer is not
making much money on wheat at present. â
Tom Reed.
FROM GOLDBUG TO HUMBUG.
If the Examiner, in its much-announced
forthcoming "silver edition," does not
make an elaborate statement of the pro
cesses by which within a year it changed
from a gold standard paper to a straight
free silver organ it will miss a great op
portunity. Sincere converts to any cause
never fail to endeavor to make other con
verts by telling the means by which their
own conversion was effected. Tbe reasons
which have impelled one man to a change
in his convictions are very likely to have
an equal influence on the minds of some
other men. The Examiner seeks converts
to its new creed, and how can it obtain
them more surely than by revealing the
cause of its own change of heart and
making that honest confession which is
good for the soul?
There can be no question that the change
of the Examiner on the silver issue has
been one of the most notable events of the
year in California journalism. But a little
while Â»go it was breathing out threats
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1896.
aeainst the apostles ot free silver and de
nouncing their creed as dangerous to the
Republic. It even went so far as to speak
scornfully of tbe men of its own home, and
referred to the advocates of silver on the
Pacific Coast as orators of the "windy
West." It was full of warnings against
the dangers of free silver and Populism.
It saw in these things a disease coming
upon the country and loudly proclaimed
the virtues of the gold cure. It has now
become a convert to all that it denounced.
It upholds that which it condemned and
condemns that which it upheld. The
chance of heart, or at least of tongue, has
been complete.
In the issue of June 7, 1895, the Examiner
said: "The free coinage of silver under
proper international agreement would
nelp our trade with all the world, but free
coinage by this country alone, unless it
succeeded in bringing both metals to a
parity, which wouid hardly be possible,
would certainly injure our commerce with
countries having the gold standard." In
the issue of September 13, 1896, it said:
"Under free coinage the silver dollar will
be worth exactly tbe same as tlio gold
dollar, and the parity between silver and
gold coined or uncoined will be 16 to 1
throughout the world." On June 4, 1895,
it said: "The attempt of the United States
to establish the bimetallic ratio of 16 to 1
throughout the world would, in case of
failure, bring us to a silver basis and cause
the greatest financial crash we have ever
known." On September 8, 1896, it de
clared: "When we have free coinage of
both gold aud silver at tbe ratio of 16 to 1
there will be a breaking up of tbe hard
financial winter that has frozen tbe indus
trial energies of this new and wealthy
country."
In the nature of things men 'change their
opinions on many subjects as they in
crease in knowledge or derive a new light
from experience. When sucn changes are
honestly made the man who has made
them delights to expound his new knowl
edge to the world and let his new light
shine that all may see it. It is only when
changes of creed are caused by some base
motive that the new convert keeps his
reasons hidden. The Examiner no doubt
has changed as the result of an increase of
knowledge. There was not only room for
such an increase, but there is room for
more. It ougut, therefore, to illumine its
silver edition with a lucia explanation of
the whole conversion, stating what it has
learned and how it learned it. The publio
will be interested iv the story, lor there
has nothing been published in the Ex
aminer lor a long time that woula be more
aniuiing than a candid autobiographical
sketch of the intellectual evolution of a
faker or the transformation of a goldbug
to a humbug.
We appeal to our fellow-citizens, above
andbeyond our belief in ourou-n party, along
lines broader and higher than that, and ask
that, as a matter of patriotism, there shall be
a united front opposed to those who are trifling
with the Nation's credit, disturbing her busi
ness interests or appealing to human preju
dices as a means of arraying section against
section or class against class, in t^e hope of
gaining political preferment. â General Me-
Alpine.
HOLLAND'S MONETARY SYSTEM.
Some of Bryan's newspaper supporters
appear to think they are justified in
making the moat glaring misstatements if
only they can turn public sentiment to
their candidate. They fully realize that
Bryan is growing weaker before the people
every day, and that unless something is
done immediately be will have bard work
to carry the lew silver-producing States.
It needs no close observer of current events
in the field of politic* to see how Bryan
himself is forfeiting the respect and confi
dence of those who really believe in him
by his ill-advised and ill-considered
speeches. The people are beginning to
believe Mr. Bryan looks upon them as
mere instruments to be played upon ac
cording as his fancy leads him, and that
is the worst possible position one could
place himself before the average Amer
ican. But some of his organs make even
worse, blunders than their candidate does.
For instance, a Missouri Bryan sheet
says:
Holland is a prosperous country and per
haps the richest, comparatively, in the world,
Silver is the only metal besides to circulate In
Holland and her colonies. The condition of
the Bank of the Netherlands indicates it
plainly. On August 8 the statement was:
Gold, 31,645,000 gulden; silver, 82,369,000
gulden; bills in circulation, 198,502,000
gulden. Instead of making comparisons
with Mexico, why do tne goldbugs never
mention Holland?
It is hard to tell whether the man who
wrote the above is stupidly ignorant,
and therefore possibly honestly disposed,
or deliberately prints misinformation
purposely to deceive his readers in the
interest of Bryan's candidacy. But any
way, there is not a syllable of truth in
what he says concerning Holland's finan
cial system. Holland is one of the most
prosperous countries in the world, and her
per capita money is larger than any other
country except Franc*, it being nearly
$26. In 1872 Holland adopted the cold
standard, and that, too, without waiting
for the aid or consent of any other nation,
but silver is used in nearly twice as large
a volume, in proportion to gold, as we use
it in this country. The July statement of
Holland's circulating money medium
placed the stock of gold at $29,000,000, the
stock of silver at $56,000,000 and the stock
of paper at $34,000,000.
Like the United States, Holland em
ploys a great deal of silver, but the ulti
mate redemption money is gold. Prior to
adopting the system of coinage now used
in this country Holland coined silver at
its commercial ratio to gold: These are
facts that any one may obtain from any
reliable work on the monetary system of
the several countries, and so it must be
that the Bryan organ referred to printed
the above for no purpose other than to de
ceive its readers, so as to keep ibem in
line with Bryan's foolish fallacies, unless
tbe editor's mind is rather more dense
than one would expect even in a rural
MiSÃourian. But Bryan's campaign is
beiiu' conducted without the "aid or con
sent" of truth, historical facts or common
sense.
DISGUSTED DEMOCRATS.
Mr. Bryan's Democracy is being assailed
in a way that is likely to turn a good many
sincere free silver advocates from him.
All Democrats are agreed that Bryan's
nomination was an accident, but it was
not then believed by many that his candi
dacy would involve the traditions of the
party, however radical he might be on the
tariff and some other questions. They
had faith in his Democracy, even if he did
err in judgment, but recent revelations
show him never to have been a Democrat.
Tbe Democrats of Virginia have just
given to the world a little inside history
which puts Mr. Bryan's Democracy in a
very awkwaid position. The story is that
when O'Ferrall, the present Governor of
Virginia, was nominated by the Demo
cratic party in 1893 Mr. Bryan was bo
Incensed because his advice was not heeded
concerning certain declarations of the
platform that he volunteered to stump the
State for the Populist candidate for Gov
ernor, bat wiser heads thsn his own per
saaded him to keep out of Virginia during
the campaign, for he not only could not
turn the tide of public sentiment against
O'Ferrall, but he would be reading him
self out of the Democratic party. He went
far enough, however, to satisfy those who
knew of his purpose that he was a good
deal more of a Populist than a Democrat.
Another story comes from South Caro
lina that puts Mr. Bryan in a still more
embarrassing position before Democrats.
As is well known South Carolina was the
only State that was not represented in the
Populist National Convention at St. Louis,
and the explanation is that tne Populists
managed through Tillman and his follow
ing to capture the Democratic party of
that State, and they believe it better poli
tics to retain the old name of that party
than to call it something else. They boast
that the Chicago convention was turned
into a Populist gathering and that Bryan
represents them truly in all things. It is
these revelations that will cau:-e the larg
est stay-at-home Democratic vote in the
history of the party.
The circulating msdium of a commercial
community must be that which is also the
circulating medium of other commercial com
munities, or must be capable of being can
verted into that medium without loss. It
must be able not only to pass in payments
and receipts between individuals of the tame
society or nation, but to adjust and discharge
the balance of exchanges between different
nations. It must be something which has a
value abroad as well as at home, and by
which foreign as we las domestic debts can be
satisfied.â Daniel Webster.
"THE SUNDAY CALL."
The opinions of the professors of the
great universities of the country on tne
silver question will be a notable feature
of The Sunday Call to-morrow. Taken
in the aggregate, this symposium of views
will be the most important contribution
yet made to the independent aide of the
controversy. Every voter ought to read
these letters, and see what the scholars
think.
While to-morrow's issue of The Call will
be of particular interest to the great major
ity of readers who are keenly interested in
political affairs, it will yet contain many
columns of bright and attractive reading
matter of genuine human interest to all
Classes of readers. Even the politicians
and those who watch every political move
closely need some mental relaxation, and
they will find it in The Sunday Call. It
is good, wholesome literature, not a line
of it dry or dull and not a line of it
that is not fat for home and family reading.
There are many new features of particular
interest in this Sunday's issue, only a few
of which are named below:
In a World of Realistic Romance.
The Greatest of the Modern Dutch
Painters.
Will the Coming Human Race Have
Fingers?
A Town Full of Human Clocks That
Travel.
Some Romantic Nooks on a Beautiful
Ranch.
Teaching Children How to Learn.
The Secrets oi Steep Ravine.
The Mine That Lies Nearest the North
Pole.
She Wasn't Bberman'a Bweetheart.
Gowns That Were Worn at the Dublin
Horse Saow.
Glories of Yosemite That Lie off the
Beaten Path.
The Powers of Profanity.
To Discourage the Bicycle Thief.
Queer Insects That Bring Rain to San
Francisco.
The Cheapest Labor Produces the Most
Expensive Warships.
CANTON AND THE PEOPLE
It is not surprising that delegations
composed of all kinds and conditions of
men should journey to Canton to show to
Major McKinley and to the country that
all lines of occupation are taking interest
in the campaign, but it U all so out oi the
usual order of things that attention is
necessarily drawn to it. A delegation of
farmers is seen marching from the rail
way station to Major McKin ley's home;
then a long line of day laborers, followed
by capitalists, who in turn give way to
mechanics, and they pass on that manu
facturers and merchants may extend
greetings to the champion of protection
and prosperity, and so tbe flow of voters
keeps up day after day.
But unless the business enterprises and
the occupations of the country felt that
tnere was need of co-operation in the field
ol politics and that they should give pub
lic expression of their approval of the
policy of government for which Major
McKiniey stands and their disapproval of
Bryanism, there would be no such demon
strations as are seen at Canton every day.
The fact is, the best interests and best
thought of the country believe that oppo
sition to Bryanism should be emphasized
on every occasion. NÂ«t so muou that
there is danger of that or any other
dangerous ism being fastened upon the
Nation, but there is a widespread senti
ment that all such fallacies should be so
severely condemned during the campaign
and on election day that it will be a long
time before a man is found who would
brave public opinion and preach such
heresies as Bryan is now preaching.
The people see that the issues have
practically passed out of the realm of
party politics aud that they must be
fought out in tbe avenues of commerce
and in the channels of trade, for it is the
well-being of business enterprises and
opportunity for labor to employ itsslf that
are threatened, and hence these interests
are joining hands against Bryanism with
out reference to party ties. It is for these
reasons that patriotic voters are flocking
to the standard of Major McKiniey.
Ample protection, undisturbed prosperity
and a sound monetary system are what
the people want.
IT IS PECULIAR.
Berkeley Gazette.
The San Francisco Call is now drawing a
deadly parallel upon the Examiner and is pro
ducing iv editorials of April and May last, in
which the independent free coinage of fcilver
at a ratio of lti to 1 is treated as a dangerous
exDerimoct in which success is almost impos
sible. It commended Carlisle's Memphis
speech and criticized the Illinois Democrats
wnen they adopted their free-silver platform.
"For ways that are dark and tricks that are
vain tne oily Examiner is peculiar."
DEATHKNELL OF BRYAN'S HOPES.
Baltimore American.
Tbe ablest statesman Iv all of the doubtful
States are ranged on the side of the Nation's
honor and the preservation of American insti
tutions, unsullied by tne touch of Populism or
anarchy. The people in the doubtful States
are as honest and patriotic as the people in
Maine and Vermont, and they have as high a
resi>ect for the statesmen who have so faith
fully served their country and who have never
been found wanting in the moment of trial.
They will be swayed by the srreat men of the
Nation ana not Djr the small fryâ ihe Joneses,
the Tillman*, the Altgelds, :he Peffers. Tom
Watsons and Boy Orators. That ia the true
â¢leuificance of tbe Maine election, and that is
why Mr. Bryan can find no response wheu
asked his opinion of the resul t. It sounds the
death km.ll of his unreasonable expectations.
AROUND THE CORRIDORS.
A. N. Butts, formerly of Spokane and en
gaged in mining in Cceur n'Alene and adjoin
ing districts, is at the Occidental. Nearly two
years ago Mr. ButU concluded to change sil
ver -mining for gold mining and, therefore,
came to California. He is now interested in a
number of placer properties here, besides two
hydraulic mines on the Middle Boise River in
Idaho.
He has so many properties that it keeps him
busy looking after them. Among his mining
A. IST. Butts on the Rapid Exten
sion of Mining in California.
{Sketched from life by a "Call" artist.}
properties are some in Calaveras County, ad
joining the Utica. He also owns the Black
hawk, near there. In Trinity County he owns
a large placer mine.
"We have just commenced working on this
property," said Mr. Butts yesterday. "I put a
force of men on recently and they are pushing
things right along. lam doing a considerable
amount of mining work in different places.
The mines all promise well.
"There has been a good deal of Interest de
veloped in California mines during the past
year. Work has started upon mines and pros
pects all over the State. It has made things a
good deal livelier all over the mining coun
try.
"It is unquestioned to my mind that business
has very much improved in California during
the past year. It is to be noticed every wht-re.
I think that the next year will sec much
greater prosperity. Everything points that
way now."

Letters From the People
NEWLANDS ON SILVER.
Declaration That Tree ' Coinage by This
Country Alone Means Silver
. . Monometallism*
Reno, Nev., Sept. 22, 1896.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: . Hon. Fran- ;
cis ;G. Newlands may properly :; be ranked
'as one of the ablest advocates of free silver in
America. He is also one of the most candid
In acknowledging the difficulties and dangers
thereof. ;On his return to this town, which is
now his home. : shortly after the repeal of the
purchasing clause of the Sherman act he was
quite despondent as to the future of silver and
; even more than usually candid. ' In an address
to his fellow-townsmen in the courthouse here
in Reno 'at that time he said : I "It is useless to
deny that the free and unlimited coinage of
silver by this country alone i means the adop
tion of the 'single silver standard;-' For my
part, I Â«m < prepared i to do . this, but the coun
try is not." Â -^SMMBHMpiiPÃÃjnpSMqggq'
I am ready, If necessary. , to make afndauit
that the > above Is * substantially a correct re
port of what I heard htm say at that time, and
many others have assured me that they would
Join me in so doing. . .
â¢He Added that he did not wish to have that
admission,; reported for publication in our
newspapers.' I 9ri^^HtVNMHB)tSSB9BBtBtt^
,: As It was publicly made in . the \ presence of
many poople, I feel there is no breach of con
fidence in : reporting it now, when his opin
ions are being utilized to influence those ot so
many others. The issue involved in this cam
paign Is o"f such ftrave import to the Nation as
to demand that the people bÂ« given access to
the truth, from whatever source it may be ob
tained. W. H. PATTERSON'.
Mr. Editor: For your personal information
as to who and what I am, I may say that I am
a stanch Republican, who would not change
one word ot the platform as written at St.
Louis. 1 have for rive years resided in Reno as
a practicing physician. Before that I lived in
Modoc County, Cal., for twenty-two years. I
at one time represented Modoc, Lassen,Plurnas
and Sierra in your State Senate. Dan Call,

THE DEMOCRATIC RECORD
Panics, Disaster* and Ttebt* Have Fol
lowed Free Trade Under Demo
eratie Jiule.
Editor San Francisco Callâ Sir: Inasmuch
as the campaign of 1896 is one of
greater importance than any since 1861-64,
it is well that the "first voter," as
he is aptly termed, should know the
record of the Democracy in the past on some
of the great questions affecting the country's
prosperity and honor. The War of 1812 was
followed by years of depression, hard times
and National despondency. In 1824 and again
in 1828 protection tariffs were passed, that
started the country on the highroud of pros
perity. The record of tne Democrats after this
is .summarized thus:
They tried iv South Carolina to nullify the
protective-tariff system, as they did not need
it there, the Democrats of that State having
slave labor aud touud it advantageous to deal
with English manufacturers.
In 1837 the Democracy repealed the tariff of
1824-iJd and adopted t*vir so-called sliding
scale reduction and times became worse than
ever and the crash of 1837 lollowed. The
V, higs in 1842 adopted a new protective tariff.
Under Polk, who was elected by the vote of
Pennsylvania, which State was deluded by the
Democratic cry of "The tariff of '42," another
free- trade bill was passed, and after the indus
tries oi New England, New Jersey and Penn
sylvania had been ruined the crash of 1857
came. When the Republicans came to the res
cue of the people the Morrill tariff of 1861 was
enacted and this enabled the country to pay iv
greut war debt, pensions, National expenses
and rejuvenated our industries at the iXDtnse
of England. The Democracy tried in 1876 and
in 1878 to pass free-trade bills, which, though
defemed, caused so much fear, loss of confi
dence and discredit as to cause depression
and disaster largely. The attempts of 1866
and 1888. finally culminating in the free-trade
bill of 1893. are fresh iv the minds of the peo
ple. We find then in
1837â Democratic crash.
1857â Democratic crash.
1878 â Democratic crash.
1893â Democratic crash.
Nut including intervals between these prin
cipal epochs of depression and hard times.
The financial question is one on which the
Democrats have heretofore made an unenvi
able record, as the following brief summary
will show: â¢
1837â Large deficiency and $10,000,000 in
treasury notes issued.
1838 â Another large issue of notes.
1839â Issue to meet deliciency.
1840â Itsue oi $5,000,000 treasury notes.
1841 â Deficiency for previous four years,
$32,000,000, and another issue of notes to
auioui.t of $12,000,000.
I*42â Deficiency of $14,000,000 and issue of
$6,000,000 ot notes.
1843â Notes to extent of $7,004,231 25 to
meet deficiency of $11,068,977 issued.
1846â President authorized to borrow $10,
-000,000.
1847â Issue of $23,000,000 in treasury notes
ordered.
1848â President to borrow $16,000,000; big
deficiency.
1857â 520,000,000 loan.
1858â Auotlier lo*n of $20,000,000.
1860â Loan of $21,000,000 ordered, Democ
racy gets only $7,022,000, too much distrust,
and iiueies. was paid *t rate of 11 per Cent.
1861â Previous to Marca 4 bonds sold to
amount of $18,415,000 at a discount of
$2,019,776 10.
The public debt in two years from JuW 1,
1857, increased from $29,060,386 90 to $68,
-754 099 33 ou July 1. 1859, and during the
present Democratic administration baids have
been issued to the extent of $262,000,000 and
the public debt increased $300,000,000.
Tne Democracy prates aooui .ts regard for
the workii:gmeu, yet a Democratic Senator
said, in 1851, they were the mud.-ills ot soci
i ety, as well as greasy mechanics, and in 1879
j a Democratic Representative from Kentucky
j scorn iuLy applied the same terms. In Con
gress in 1859 a Douglas Democrat said, refer
ring to the majority of Democrats, "They, to a
man almost, voie against the iree independent
labor of tne North and West."
The question of land for the landless free
meu.or slaves for the slaveholders, all Demo
crats, was settled by the great Republican
party by giving land to the landless and tak
ing the siaves from the slaveholders, thus giv
ing free labor a chance to earn a decent live
lihoo-1.
In the first session of the Twenty-fourth
Coauress the Democracy proclaimed by one of
its Representatives, Hammord, that the peo
ple were "the mob, the sans-culottes, ignorant,
unedu"ated and semi-barbarous." Tney went
further and proclaimed, through Pickens, that
capital should "own labor, either collectively,
through the Government, or individually, in
a state of domestic servitude, as in the South
ern States." Again they said that if "laborers
ever obtain the political power of a country it
is in fact in a state of revolution."
The Democracy, through its leaders, went
further in its denunciation of labor thirty
years ago than they dare do now. Keith ex
pressed the Democratic sentiment of that day
when he said: "When the white working
classes stepped out of bondage they branched
into four recurring subdivisionsâ me hireling,
the thief, the beggar and the prostitute." A
Democratic newspaper once said slavery was
"the great peace-maker between capital and
labor." Another said: "Free society is bur
dened with a servile class of mechanics and
laborers unfit for self-government."
Fitzhugh, a Democrat, in his book, "Canni
bals All, or Who Shall Be Masters," said:
"Lloerty for the few, slavery iv every form for
the masses." To-day in the Democratic South,
which is Bryan's mainstay, the infernal system
of peonage exists, which makes it impossible
for the white laborer or mechanic to compete
with li, or even obtain employment at ail.
The Richmond Enquirer, a leading Democratic
newspaper, once said: "The laws of all the
Southern States justified the holding of white
men in slavery." These sentiments of the
Democracy in the past have not been materi
ally altered, yet it asks the laborer ana me
chanic to forgive and forget, but give them
(Democrats) the offices. There is but one issue
before the people of the United States to-day,
and that is: â¢â¢Shall we employ ourselves and
our free mechanics and workmen, or let the
slave labor of the countries of the world do our
work?" "Free silver" is a trick, fraud and de
vice intended to allure the people from tne
only issue, that of protecting themselves and
repealing the present free-trade act, and enti
tled to no serious consideration. Free trade
and fifty-cent dollars mean free Boupnou.*es
ultimately. E. M. Galvin.

LADY'S SHORT CUTAWAY JACKET
The jaunty models of this season are cuta
way in shape, very short with small revers.
The flaring skirt is preferred to the fan back in
these short jackets. Narrow belts are much
worn, slipped through the under-arm seam or
he dart, leaving the iront free,
t Made of plain colors, such as brown, tan,
black and blue, a serviceable garment to wear
with any skirt is gained.
There is a fancy for plain jackets, with skirts
of checked or plaid goods. One of blue with,
a Droken blue Â«nd white check for the skirt',
had no buttonholes, but on either side several
tiny gilt buttons, and was worn with a gilt
belt. : , . " " "
A nunter's green cloth jacket had a skirt of
mixed cheviot that toned in beautifully.
Bilk waists are worn for general use, but
there is an innovation this season in the shape
oi exquisitely dainty vests of lace, to be worn
'with tailor-made costumes. These are gener
ally made on a body of cambric partially
fitted. The woman who- cherishes her pretty
jacket lining puts sleeves in this under-waist.
. The skirts made specially to wear with these
jackets are well gored to insure a : lasting
shape. They are moderately wide usually, not
more than six yards round, and generally less
than this. __________________

The Barkentine W. H. Dimond
Got In Yesterday in Fair
Time.
TROUBLE ON THE GARRATT.
Chief Engineer and Chef Steward
Had an Altercation That Ended
in Bloodshed.
All the sailing vessels from the Ha
waiian Islands have been making re
markably lonj.' voyages of late. The mo
notony was broken yesterday when the
barkentine \V. 11. Dimond got in. She
made the run in the fair time of 22 days,
this beating the Alden Besse 30 days, An
drew Welch 29 days and the Rhoderick
Dhu32days. The DimoiU is loaded with
sugar and rice, and is consigned to J. D.
Spreckels & Bros. Company. Fair winds,
but light, were experienced throughout
the trip, and Captain Xiison was able
to sail his vessel in through the Golden
Gate and to an anchorage off the
sugar refinery. He says that the voyage
was a long one, but was somewhat con
soled when he heard of the long trips
made by the other vessels.
The harbor police are anxiously look
ing for a potato peddler who attempted to
steal a gunny of sugar from the Sacra
mento steamer San Joaquin. He was
loading his wagon on Washington-street
wharf and incidentally picked np the
sugar. He soon discovered that the police
had bnen summoned and made his escape.
His wagon and horse, with the stolen
sugar, were taken to the police station
and will be held until the thief is caught
and the rightful owner is found.
There was a stabbing affray on the
Stockton steamer Mary Garratt last Thurs
day night. Thief Engineer Sampson and
Chief bteward Stackpole got into an alter
cation. A free fight ensued and Stack
pole got off with a scalp wound. He says
he was cut with a knife. No arrests were
made.
There is one man on the Oceanic Steam
ship Company's Mariposa that will be glad
when sailing day arrives. The vessel only
got in on Thursday, but nevertheless her
nose cannot be turned toward Australia
again too quick for Frank Funke. He is
! in the steward's department, and was mar
ried to Miss Edith Smith a day beiore the
Mariposa sailed for San Francisco. The
bride was left behind, but next trip Frank
expects to bring her along and domicile
her in a neat little home in the Mission.
Captains of sailing vessels that have to
use Oakland Creek are loud in their de
nunciations of the actions of steam
schooner and freigbtboat masters. Vessels
under steam have invariably to give way
to vessels under sail, but this the schooner
skippers claim is never done. The chan
nel is narrow, and the steamers when they
want to pass push their noses against the
craft unaer sail and push her away.
On every occasion the sailing vessel
suffers to the extent of $10 or $20 for broken
rigging and torn sails, while the steamer
| escapes without any damage. Bills have
been sent to the owners of the offending
crafts, but no satisfaction has ever been
i obtained. Now the schooner owners have
I combined and suit will be brought against
the next steamer that crowds a sailing
ship. Captain Eick, owner of the schooner
C. L. Place, and a number of others are at
the Head of the movement, and the cap
tain intends to see the matter through the
courts.
The monitor Monad nock will sail for
Eureka in a couple of days, and will re

the company stationed at that point will
be drilled in the various maneuvers prac
ticed aboard a man-of-war. The company
at Eureka will be the last of those on the
coaÂ«t to take a trip to sea on a warship.
The biggest tow ever made on this coast
was that of the tug Ftarless last Thursday.
Captain Dan Haskell brought down from
Port Costa the British ships Hollinswood
and Jordanhill. Both vessels were loaded
with wheat, nevertheless the run down
was made in three hours and ten minutes,
one of the quickest trips on record, con
sidering the circumstances. Captain Dan
Haskell put ;the Fearless alongside the
Jordanhill, and, taking the Holiinswood
in tow, came along during the entire run
at a ten-knot gait
CATHERINE DISQUALIFIED.
The Yacht Truant Winner of the Re
gatta Cup.
The regatta committee of the Pacific
Interclub Yacht Association held a meet

last evening, and after a lengthy confer
ence disqualified the yacht Catherine,
which won the cap in the regatta of the
9th inst
At the finish of the race on the 9th inst.
the yacht Truant was declared the winner.
A few days later, however, the Catherine
was reraeasnred, and it was found that she
was entitled to the cup over the Truant,
t'aving beaten the latter over thirty sec
onds corrected time. This led to a discus
sion, and it was found that the Catherine
was sailed by a professional sailor in the
race. The case was taken up by the com
mittee last evening and the boat was dis
qualified and the cup awarded the Truant.
The Whirlwind, which Bailed third in
the race, was given second place.

BUCKLEYITES IN
THE HIGH COURT
They Ask Only a Place
Beside the Junta on
the Ballot.
THE CASE ONE OF LAW
Questions of Fact and State
Committee Authority Are
Not Raised at All.
REGISTRAR'S POWER THE ISSUE
Tbe Buckley Side Admits Hinton's
Answer and Makes the Battle on
a Purely Legal Point.
The Supreme Court had placed before it
yesterday the case of the Buckleyites, in
volving their right to go on the official
ballot with tbe title "Democrat," and a
decision is looked for some time next
week.
Tbe arguments consumed about two
hours of the afternoon and were listened
to by all the Justices except Henshaw, the
court sitting in bank.
Attorneys David Freidenrich and Peter
F. Dunne presented tbe side of the Buck-
leyites and Garret W. McEnerney repre
sented Registrar Hinton directly and the
Junta side of the ca^e indirectly.
Quite a crowd of politicians and others
were interested listeners of the argument.
Joseph RothschilJ, A. T. Spotts, James
H. O'Brien, W. F. Humphreys, T. Carl
Spelling, D. M. Gavigan and others of
the Buckleyites helped crowd the court
room and several of the opposing faction
were there.
The case did not develop the interest
that it had been expected to do because
the Buckleyites decided not to go at all
into questions of fact, and the issues as to
the authority of either side to represent
the party and the right of the State Cen
tral Committee and the State convention
to decide what organization is the regular
local party were not touched.
The Buckleyites decided to rest their
case wholly on one question of law in
volving the construction of a portion of
section 1192 of the Political Code requir
ing the Registrar to pass upon and
promptly accept or refuse all certificates
of nomination filed with him.
The proceeding was upon the petition
for a writ of mandate, filed a few days
ago, directing the Registrar to accept and
Elace upon the official ballot the name of
Â». A. Macdonald, nominee for Superin
tendent of Btreets. Registrar Hinton re
fused to file the Buckley ticket on the
ground that the Buckley organization did
not represent the Democratic party, which
at the last election polled more than 3 per
cent of the vote cast.
In giving this decision Registrar Hinton
considered questions of fact which did
not appear from the Tace of the certificate
and he exercised a judicial function!
Messrs. Freidenrich and Dunne contended
that the Registrar was wholly a ministerial
officer; that his objections must be lim
ited to irregularities which mightappear in
the face of the document and that he must
accept any ticket properly attested and
certified to. It was thus conteqded that
two or more sets of candidates might have
a place on the ballot under the same
party designation.
Garret McEnerney scouted this conten
tion and forcibly argued that the question
was decided by the highest party author
ity in the State.
The case was called at 10 a. m., when
McEnerney at once read the answer to the
petition. Xhe lengthy answer averred :
That at all of the times in the petition stated
the political organization known as "the Dem
ocratic party of the City and County of San
Framisco" was in fact part and parcel of a
political organization and party known as "the
Democratic pariy of the State of California,"
and waa not a separate or distinct organization
therefrom, but was au integral part thereof.
That there is not now and never was any
political organization in the City and County
of San Francisco known ac "the Democratic
party of the City and County of San Fran
cisco." save and except as an integral pan of
the Democratic party of the State ot Cali
fornia.
The municipal convention which nomi
nated the petitioner was called without
any rigtit or power whatever; bat a cer
tain other convention, now in session, was
the only one having any right to repre
sent the Democratic party in San Fran
cisco. It was recited that at a meeting of
the State Central Committee held March
14, 1806, two sets of persons claimed to be
the General Committee of the party in
San Francisco, and that the State Central
Committee adjudged that the General
Committee from which the petitioner,
gained his alleged rights was not entitled
to represent the Democratic party. This
judgment was ratified by the State Con
vention later. The answer ends by alleg
ing:
That the effect of granting the prayer of pe
titioner herein and allowing; his name to be
printed on the official ballot will be to deceive
and confuae the voters and to disfranchise a
large proportion of them, and will amouut to
a fraud upon the public.
Attorney Freidenrich intimated that
testimony might be offered, and asked an
adjournment until 2 p. m.
"If an issue of fact is raised the case
cannot be heard to-day." observed Chief
Justice Beatty, and McEnerney said that
if an issue oi" fact was raised it would re
quire several days.
After a short uUcussion the side of the
petitioner was granted until 2 p. m. to
decide what course to pursue in meeting
the answer.
When court reconvened in the afternoon
Freidenrich stated that the facts stated in
the answer would be formally admitted.
The whole controversy, it was stated,
turned on the construction of the follow
ing portion of section 1192 of the Political
Code, prescribing the duties of the Regis
trar when a certibcate of nomination is
presented to him:
Whenever any certificate of nomination is
presented for tiling to any officer authorized to
file the game, such officer shall forthwith, upon
The Attorneys Who Argued a New Election Law Issue in the]
Supreme Court Yesterday.
receipt of the name and before filing, examine
the same, and if there is any delect, omission
or reason why the same should not bs filed
such officer shall then and there forthwith
designate in writing the defect, omission or
reason why such certificate cannot be filed and
return the said certificate to the person pre
senting the same, with such written designa
tion of defect, omission or reason for not filing
the same.
The issue was particularly involved in
the words "reason why such certificate
cannot be filed." Such reason, it was con
tended, must appear upon the face of the
certificate. The respondent's reason had
alleged that the verified certificate was
untrue. Tbe law had not only not made
provision for the Registrar entering into
questions of fact or provided machinery
by which it might be done but bad, in fact,
made it impossible by requiring that he
should act "forthwith.''
Justice McFarlandâ What then is to
prevent any number of factions, acting
perhaps iv good faith as far as tney them
selves are concerned, from presenting and
having filed their certificates?
Freidenrichâ l suppose it would be the
duty of the officer to accept them and
leave questions of fact to the courts.
A number of recent decisions in Eastern
States were quoted in support of the con
tention that the courts should let factions
run their tickets side by side with equal
favor. Political parties were voluntary
associations which voters might change
and reorganize at will. The question was
essentially political and not judicial. This
rule gave the voter fuller freedom in cast
ing bis ballot.
Garret McEnerney replied at length.
"The only question in the case is, Is the
petitioner entitled to the right to goon
the ticket representing a party which it is
admitted he does not represent? Is tie
convention from which petitioner received
bis nomination an organized assemblage
of delegates representing a political party
which at the last election polled at least 3
per cent of the entire vote, etc.? No, it Is
an organized assemblage putting fortb a
false or bogus claim."
The Chief Justice intimated that some
of the Justices were doubtful whether the
court could go into questions of fact.
Mr. Dunne argued that the Kegistrar
could pass under the ballot act only on
formal objections, and that if it were
otherwise he would be invested with an
extraordinary and dangerous power not
contemplated by the Legislature, and
wholly foreign to bis capacity as a mere
ministerial officer. It was pointed out
that the ballot jaw makes no provision tor
notice or hearing in case of candidates
affected by an adverse decision of the Reg
istrar; that no machinery is provided for
the conduct of any inquiry by the Regis
trar, and that no time is permitted for
such inquiry, inasmuch as the Registrar,
on presentation ot a nomination certifi
cate, is required to decide forthwith.
In other words, the Registrar is confined
to what he knows officially at the time
the certificate is presented, and such
knowledge is derivable only from tbe face
of tbe certificate. These views were sup
ported by citations from English decisions
in cases of Parliamentary and municipal
elections, and by American decisions in
Colorado, Michigan, Nebraska and New
York. Reference was made to the decision
of the court of this State in the election
case of 1892, where party headings were
stricken from tbe ballot, and it was claimed
that a decision allowing any faction claim
ing in good faith to represent the party to
go upon tbe ballot would be in aid of a
larger freedom of choice by the voter and
a nearer approach to the ideal Australian
ballot.
The court requested the attorneys to file
their memoranda by Monday nest, and the
question as to the power of" the Registrar
at issue and the possibility of two or more
wings of a parry using the party name on
the official ballot were submitted to the
court.
CARNIVAL OP NATIONS.
Continued Success Attend* the Fete of
the Women's Educational and
Industrial Union.
A large number of society people vis
ited the Carnival of Nations last night,
Native Sons' Hall, spacious though it is,
being at times uncomfortably crowded.
England, Germany and Denmark were
the favored nations and it would be
bard to say which made the best
showing. The first tableau, " The
Coronation of Queen Elizabeth,"
was a marvel of spectacular magnificence,
while "Germania and Her States" was de
servedly admired on account of the grace
ful posing and effective grouping of the
participants; but the "Danish Country
Dance seemed to please everybody by
reason of its being so faithful and charm
ing a picture of viliage eayety.
Tbe Sacred Heart College orchestra of
fifty pieces provided the music for the
evening, and trained new laurels for its
masterly rendering of the classic pro
gramme: The "Tannhauser" overture,
Handel's largo and Tittl's serenade were
among the best numbers.
In tbe reception parlor Mine. Roeckel
and a few musical friends gave a vocal
treat which was much appreciated, among
the singers being Mrs. H. Lewis, Miss
Jennie Jonansen, Miss Tillie Miley, Miss
Emiiie Schneider, Miss Adela Galvez, Miss
Annette Miley, Mine. P. Keiter, Edward
Lotz and Oscar Frank.
Mme. Sorbier and tbe other members
and friends of tbe Women's Educational
and Industrial Union are delighted at the
success which the carnival ban achieved,
the receipts up to date far exceeding their
most rosy expectations.
SUFFRAGE WORKERS.
Sending in Glowing Reports of Sym-
pathy and Success In All Town*
Thus Far Visited. '
Reports from outside workers in the
woman suffrage campaign are most en
couraging.
In a letter from Southern California
Misa Harriet May Mills writes that the
prevailing sentiment in tbe many towns
which she visited is most friendly to the
cause, and does not hesitate to say that If
it is an index to the general feeling in the
State the woman suffrage amendment to
the constitution will pass by a large ma
jority.
From Los Angeles and other centers of
work come reports of similar tenor. Some
of the workers travel from twenty to forty
miles daily in stages and private vehicles,
speaking wherever they can find an audi
ence, however small. San Diego and
Fresno clamor for more speakers, and the
head center in this City is hard poshed in
order to meet even a part of the demands
which come in day after day.

Assemblyman from the Thirty-fifth has
represented ip the last Legislature, when
he ran independent and came in a hand
some winner.
Having disposed of these aspirants for
Stale honors the convention made a care
ful examination of the exhibits produced
by the priming-knife committees which
had been selected by the convention to
examine candidates for the position of
Supervisors.
After the analytical test had been ap
plied the convention decided that the fol
lowing named citizens would be afforded
an opportunity of having their names
printed on that pink colored sheet known
in law as the official ballot:
Seventh Ward â C. Grambarth, a dealer
in cigars, who resides at 560 Howard
street.

reipected drayman, who resides at 20
Stanley place.

known banker and president of the Civic
Federation, who resides at Twentieth
street and San Carlos avenue.
Twelfth Wardâ J. C. Conwell, the man
ager of the Indiana Bicycle Company, who
resides at 1513% Ellis street.
Having disposed of this amount of busi
ness, the convention adjourned until to
night, when the remaining Supervisors
will be nominated.
UNIDENTIFIED GRAVES,
Records on Soldiers' Headstones
in National Cemeteries
Incomplete.
An Appeal Will Be Made to Congress
by the Grand Army to Repeal
Obnoxious Features.
That noted military chieftain Sir John
Falstaff esteemed the private soldier
"food for powder and good enough to fill
a pit." And when a nice review is taken
of the events and the services of the men
who shaped the history of the country,
beginning in 1861 and ending four years
later, it would seem as if the words of
that bacchanalian prince were good
enough to express the sentiments of
many as they now regard the men who
filled the ranks of the Union army during
the darkest days of the country'speril.
The average private soldier has not
figured largely in eulogy, but this fact is
no reason why the soldier's grave should
not be properly marked and his last rest
ng-place easily preserved for identifica
tion.
Among the sacred acres.which hold the
dust of tne soldiers of the war for the
preservation of the Union are those at
the Presidio in this City.
One would expect to find a community
in death here and the accidental distinc
tion in rank and uniform left behind, but
snch is not the case. There is set aside a
plat for officers, within whose sacrea pre
cincts the remains of no insensate enlisted
man is permitted to rest, but in another
part of the hallowed ground the remains
of the common soldier are interred and
his last resting-place is often treated with
a disregard of law and order.
This matter the Grand Army of the Re
public in San Francisco has at last taken
up, and its members will make an appeal
to Congress and the Legislature for re
dress.
The original act of Congress, approved
February 22, 1867, made it mandatory lor
the quartermaster's department to furnish
on requisition a headstone, on which was
to be graved the name, rank, company
and legiment of every deceased indi
gent soldier, but the act was amended
June 8, 1872, which changed the provi
sions of the first, and making the head
stones contain only the name and State,
from which the soldier bad enlisted, to
gether with a simple number on bis grave.
It is the later law which Grand Army
comrades will seek to have repealed, as
the omission of the company and regi
ment on the headstones is an injustice to
the memory of the deceased soldier. In
the plat of George H. Thomas Post in the
National Cemetery at the Presidio there
are seven comrades buried in thie way.
Grand Army men claim that the history
of the soldier should be engraved on his
tombstone, and the plan of placing num
bers thereon, an act so suggestive of past
penal servitude or a pauper's fate, be
abrogated.
Grand Ma<tÂ«- Meeting.
To-morrow afternoon, at 3 o'clock, fn the
auditorium of the Young Men's Christian
Association, corner of Mason and Ellis streets,
there will be a grand union mass-meeting, to
be addressed by Miss Anna H. Shaw. Mrs.
Sarah B. Cooper will preside and introduce
the speaker. Rev. George C. Adams of St. Louis
will also assist, and severalcity pastors will take
part in the service. The body of the hail will
ne reserved for men, and the gallery nnd bal
cony for ladies. The services will be open tree
to all. The public invited.
Phillips Will Recover.
Philip Phillips, the despondent tailor, at 5
Eddy street, who swallowed a dose of chloro
form on Wednesday, did not make a success of
his attempt to commit suicide. Yesterday he
had so far recovered as to permit of his being
removed from the Receiving Hospital. Phillips
was a member of one of the lodges of Foresters
and was said to be about $100 short in his ac
counts as treasurer. Whether it was business
troubles or temporary insanity that caused
him to try to end his life is not known. .
A Family Quarrel.
Gustav Schutte, a photographer, was arrested
on a charge of battery yesterday on complaint
of his sister. The two conduct a photograph
ing gallery and from all accounts they do not
get along well together. It is stated that on
Thursday- Schutte pushed his sister along a
long hallway to get her out of his way, as she
disturbed him by talking too much. The sister
retaliated by causing her brother's arrest.
A Dangerous Game.
Alfred Fawks, a lad 9 years of age, living at
18a Ringold street, lies at the Receiving Hos
pital with a fractured skull, the result of play
ing "duck-on-a-rock," a game very popular
with boys. He and several companions were
amusing themselves on the street, and one of
the boys was trying to knock the "duck" off the
ruck with a large cobblestone. In the excite
ment of the game young Fawks got his head
within the line of fire and the cobblestone
fractured his skull. He will probably recover.
A WAR ROMANCE.
How General MoMahon Loved a Fair
Virginia Girl.
Happening to meet General Martin T.
McMahon downtown a day or two ago,
just after leaving the banking-house of
Work, Strong <fe Co., I indulged in a rem
iniscence. Mr. Strong married the best
known girl in the South during the war,
and General McMahon tried nis best to
marry the next best known. Half the
Army of the Potomac knew of Alice
Smith, the belle of Alexandria, and a
large part of the army of Northern Vir
ginia fell in love with Fanny Smith of
Warrenton. The girls were not related.
They just happened to be named Smith,
and were beautiful as the dawn. AJice,
now Mrs. Strong, bad all the manners
that would grace a court, was highly edu
cated and high strung. bbe has two
grown daughters. Clifton Smith of the
Stock Exchange is her brother.
General McMahon, then on the staff
of General SedgwicK, met and loved
Fanny Smith. No more gallant man went
to the front. He never made war. on
women and children. He was their pro
tector and guardian, wherever he hap
pened to be stationed. His love for Fanny
was returned, but the girl declared that
she could never marry a Northern
man. He pleaded with her. He
said that if she would marry him
he would resign from the army at once
and take her, her mother and brother
Ueorge to Europe, there to remain until
the war was over. Still she refused.
Courted by the finest men in the army,
she could have selected any of them for a
husband, but her Jove for the dashing Mc-
Mahon and her patriotism coming in col
lision caused her to sacrifice herself. She
became the wife of a farmer, ana is living
to-day in the mountains, about twelve
miles from Warrenton.
If I mistake not, General McMahon had
a rival in tne affections of Fanny Smith.
He belonged to Mosby's command and
would gallop thirty or forty miles in a
night to get a glimpse of her at breakfast
time. One he violated Mosby's orders
and came near being sent back to the reg
ular service â the worst possible punish
ment fora Mosby man. He rode through
the Yankee lines and stopped at the stile in
front of the Smith house for a drink of
water. Fanny, espying a familiar Con
federate uniform, ran down with a piece
of pie, sat on the stile and talked with the
stranger. He ioved her from that minute,
and it was nip and tuck between him and
General McMahon. She made confirmed
bachelors of both. Both live here to-day.
They ought to meet and talk it over. â New
York Press.

QUEER THINGS ABOUT EARS
Their Shape and Size Generally an In
dex to Character.
The Anthropological Society met re
cently in the parlors of the Cosmos Club,
Madison place and H street northward.
Dr. D. 8. Lamb opened with a lecture,
entitled "A Study in Ears." There was a
pronounced difference in ears, tie said,
even when the ears of animals of the same
species were considered. This, togther
witn the different opinions of the several
specialties, made positive figures almost
impossible. Generally speaking, however,
there were relative marks which gave a fair
index of the character.
For instance, it was nearly positive that
in the brute kingdom, at least, small,
well-formed ears meant intelligence. The
size of the ears showed much. Tasing a
basis of fifty decrees for the medium
organ, the difference could be traced mi
nutely. The professor illustrated these re
marks with the aid of charts, compiled
from Topinard indexes.
Again, he said, there was much in the
position of the ear. Some claimed that
the organ's ext nsion from the head invar
iably meant criminality, all other things
being equal. Of course, other than nat
ural influences might have something to
do with that observation, admitting, as an
example that a child sleeping on one ear
constantly would cause the organ of that
side to grow near the Head.
Head dress in certain countries affected
this to some extent. The power of mov
ing the organ of hearing portrayed to
a certain extent the influences of life.
Animals in constant danger had tbis
power to a remarkable decree, but Darwin
claimed that man tad lost it entirely
through the general absence of its need.
Still, some people could move the ear re
markably well, especially upward and
backward. Returning to the flat ear the
doctor said that some claimed animals
which used their teeth as weapons always
had the flat ear. He would net vouch for
this.â Washington Post.
Savannahs Kound Tower.
"Visitors to Savannah," said Henry B.
Galloway of that city at the Riggs House
last evening, "exhibit great interest in a
small, round tower that is easily discern
ible when approaching the city from the
sea. It is of stone, moss-grown and ivy
covered. The residents of the neighbor
hood are fond of telling thrilling stories
of the part the fort played in Spanish and
Indian warfare, and tney say that it was
built about the time Bt. Augustine was
founded.
'The truth of the matter is thst the
tower was erected by the United States
Government during the war of 1812. It
saw some little service during the **'iate
unpleasantness " but did not figure in any
great action on a promontory. At present
it is used as a reporting and sienal station
and frequently in the summer season oar
tieaof bathers and fishermen make it their
headquarters when on expeditions from
Tybee and other seashore resorts."âWash
ington Times.

POPULISTS NAME
MORE CANDIDATES
List of Men Suggested for
the Senate and
Assembly.
MANNER OF SELECTION.
Conference Committee Virtually
Authorized to Select
Nominees.
SAM BRAUNHARI'S TROUBLES.
Wraith of a Cigarmakers' Union
Committea Hakes His Hair
Stani On Ed
The legislative convention of the Popu
lists was held at Cambrian Hall, Mission
street, between Seventh and Eighth, last
night. The legislative convention is com
posed of two delegates from each of the
Assembly districts, but only thirty-one
delegates were present at the session. J.
R. Ruxtell acted as chairman.
Shortly after the meeting was called to
order it went into executive session. All
matters pertaining to nomination were
referred to the conference committee.
This means virtually that the conference
committee will select all nominees.
T. V. Cator told of his trip through the
State and stated that forty-five out of
sixty-one delegates were for him.
This news was received with hearty ap
plause.
Then came the most important part of
the meeting â the suggestion of names as
candidates for the Assembly and Senate
from the various districts. Names were
suggested as follows:
Seventeenth Senatorialâ Samuel Braun
hart, Larry Dwyer, Thomas Egau, Peter
F. Seculovich; Nineteenth Senatorialâ O.
H\ Lurje; Twenty-first Senatorial â
J. D. Powers, Hugo Asher, W.
J. Bell; Twenty - fifth Senatorial â
John Fay, George If. Callahan; Twenty
nintn Assembly, J. J. Meagher; Thirty
tirst Assembly, George D. GiUespie;
Thirty-second Assembly, F. M. Livin
gcod; Thirty-fourth Assembly, John Fay ;
Thirty-sixth Assembly, J. McGratb, A. T.
Green; Thirty-seventn Assembly. H. Me
lireevy; Thirty-eighth Assembly. A. S.
Goldstone, W." F. Perry, J. S. Wardell;
Thirty-ninth Assembly, W. F. Baggett,
F. M. Tooley, L. Burnett ; Fortieth Assem
bly, J. H. Tingman; Forty-first Assembly,
Frank Schmitz, J. P. Dameron, ri. M.
Owens; Forty-second Assembly, E. J.
Reynolds, W. N. Grlswold; Forty -fourth
Assembly, G. Nathan; Forty-fifth Assem
bly, F. Mulgrew, William Gately.
A resolution was adopted that the press
be requested to publish the fact that the
conference committee will receive nomina
tions at room 8, Murphy building, every
day between the hours of !2 m. and 2 p. m.
During the whole session of the body
much amusement was afforded by the
spectacle of Sam Braunhart collaring every
delegate that came out of the meeting to
learn his chances. Bam boasted that he
had "done Rainey and the rest of the
bosses up," but nevertheless he appeared
on pins and needles lest the Populists fail
to indorse him.
What excited his indignation most of all
was a rumor in active circulation to the
effect that a committee from the Cigar
makers' Union had come up to protest
against his indorsement, on the ground
that he was interested in a Chinese cigar
factory on Washington street. Sam simply
formed at the mouth at the very thought.
As regards the authenticity of ' the
rumor, several members of the convention
freely admitted that a committee had
come into the corridor to meet a commit
tee from the Cigar-Bakers' Union, bnt had
failed to lind it. Most of them were very
reticent, bat one delegate admitted the
main facts.
J. J. Msagher, Democratic candidate
from the Twenty-ninth Senatorial Dis
trict, stated that the reason the Populist
committee had failed to find theVorn
mittee from the Cigar-makers' Union
was because the latter had been
informed by a delegate that all
grievances would be heard at T. V. Cator's
offices in the Mills building next Monday.
The convention adjourned to meet Fri
day night, the place to be selected by
Secretary Gillespie.

official figures showing the division of the
sexes In the United States are those of the
census of 1890. According to these there
were 32.667,880 males and 30,554,370 fe
males. You have the figures and can work
out the percentage.
Probattng a Willâ J. D., City. A person who
Is the custodian of a will in tbis State must
file it within thirty days after receiving notice

viduals presented by the Grand Jury are as a

To Reduce Fleshâ W. D., Palo Alto, Cal.
A man who wishes to train and diet, with a
view to reduce flesh, should not do so without
consulting a competent physician, who will be
able to tell him to what extent he should diet
himself and how much reduction his physique
will stand without injury to himself. As no
two men are constituted alike what might be
good for one might be harmful to another.
While limes and limejuice are in many cases
of benefit to the user, it is doubtful if a phy
sician would advise a person to use four limes
a day as a steady thing.
Transit of Ventsâ a. 8., City. The transit
of Verms across the face of the sun commenced
at 8:40 p. M., December 8, 1874, and ended at

ment islands in the bay of San Francisco must
first obtain a permit from army headquarters
in the Phelan building. There is a Govern
ment steamer that Dlles between the City of
San Francisco and the islands, and it is on
this that persons who obtain permission to
visit them may take passage. The vessel gen
erally leaves from Washington-street wharf.
The party obtaining the permit will be told ac
headquarters from which point on the City
front the steamer leaves.
Revenceâ Q. J. L., Beth nay, Ban Joaquin
County, Cal. Under the McKinley tariff
bill there was not only enough reve
nue to meet the expenses of the Gov
ernment, but there was a surplus. The dif
ference between the McKinley and the
Gorman-Wilson bill ia that the lormer helped
to pay the National debt and reduce it, while
! the latter plunged the country deeper into
debt. Under the McKinley law during the
nrst nineteen mouths of its operation there
was a surplus of nearly $25,000,000, during
the first nineteen months of the Gorman-Wil
son there was a deficit of $76,000,000.
The Montebxy's Gtjnsâ J. F. L., City. The

(rifles} and two ten-pound breech-loading
rifles constructed in the foundry of the Ord
nance Department, Washington (D. C.) Navy
yard; six six- pound rapid-firing Hot eh kiss
guns and four one-pound rapid-firing Hotch
kiss nuns constructed by Pratt & Whitney of
Hartford, Conn. ; the small arms, Lee-Reming
ton rifles by the Remington Arms Company of
New York and the Colt's douole-action re
volvers by the Colt's Firearm Company of
Hartford, Conn. This shows that the arma
ment is all of American manufacture.
Payments in Silverâ J. M. H., Hengy, Butte
County, CaL United States standard dollars
are legal tender in an unlimited amount un
less otherwise expressed in the contract. Sub
sidiary silver coin, which includes half dol
lars, quarters and dimes, is legal tender to the
extent of $10 only. Standard silver dollars
are not exchangeable for gold, but are ex-
changeable lor silver certificates or smaller
silver coin. There is nothing to prevent your
friend B going to a bank with $100 in stand
ard silver dollars and askine that the same be
exchanged for five twenty-dollar pieces even
up, but he would not receive them. As a mat
ter of accommodaiion the sub-treasurer in San
Francisco would exchange gold for silver, but
that practice was recently stopped by order
from the Treasury Department.
ThÂ« Fowlersâ N. 8. M.. Bast Oakland, CaL

time since, was a brother of Orson Squire Fow
ier. The last named was born in Cohocton, N.
V., October 11, 1809, and died in Sharon Sta
tion, same State, August 18, 1887. He was a

gan the publication of the Phrenological Jour
nal. In 1843 they admitted Samuel R. Wells
as a member of the firm and the firm became

Fowler withdrew, and after that, up to within
a month of his death, he lectured all over the
United States. It was he who visited San
Francisco.
Zkrah Colbuhnâ E. G. 8., Livermore, Cal.
Zerah Colburn, the lightning calculator, was
born In Cabot, Vt., September 1. 1804, and
died at Norwich, in the Â«ame State, on March
2, 1840. His strange mathematical power de
veloped itself at the age of 6 years, and his
father rejecting the offer of Professor Wheelock,
president of Dartmoutn, to give him an educa
tion, put him on exhibition as a prodigy. In
Boston, in 1811, he astonished the learned,
as well as the public, and thence was
carried to the South, and in 1812 was taken to
England. In Paris, Fiance, he instantly gave
the factors of 4,294,907.297 (announced Â»s a
prime number), the cube root of 268,
-336,125. etc. He studied for a short
time in the Lycee Napoleon. The Earl
of Bristol placed him in Westminster
School from 1816 to 1819, but his father cut
short his education and made him prepare
for the: stage, but in this he proved a
failure and he engaged in teaching. His
natural protector, died In 1824, and he
returned to America, but by that time
his . extraordinary talent had departed
and he was in every respect an ordinary man
He continued his studies at Burlington Col
lege, Vt., joined the : Methodists in 1825 was
an itinerant preacher for nine years, published
his memoirs in 1833 and became professor of
languages in Norwich- in 1837 and died there
in the 36th year of his age. â¢ " " â¢
International Bimetallismâ A. E. 8., City.
Those who favor' international bimetallism
desire , that the â  different countries of the
world shall adopt a double standard, gold and
silver, and that the two metals shall be main

as win De noticed Dy a reierence to the
cycling department, there are several
road-racing events scheduled for to-mor
row which should attract large crowds.
The trap-shooting season is drawing to
a close, and sportsmen are looking pleas
antly forward to some good quail aud duck
shooting in October.
James J. Corbett is playing what he
thinks a very cunning game with some of
the local boxing clubs. It looks now as if
Corbett and Sharkey have had an under
standing. If they should meet here there
will be many people fooled into paying big
prices to see what now has the appearance
of being a hippodrome. The football
players are practicing for the near-futcre
games. Rifle-shooters, oarsmen and leaÃh
men are all having good sport at their re
spective pastimes.

club race, joint clud race, record trial and
r tandem race, all at five miles, besides
. the usual number of club runs, most of
â¢ which latter, however, will be directed to
witness these road events.
The joint club race between the Olympic
Club Wheelmen and the Garden* City
Cyclers probably ranks first in import
ance. It is to be held over a new course
from Milpitas to the junction of the San
Jose and Gish roads. The race will start
at 11 o'clocK, and the O.ympics will leave
here on the 6:30 boat, in order to reach

The Bay city Wheelmen's tandem race
did not bring out as many entrants as ex
pected, but there will be six speedy teams
to contest, and fast time is a certainty, j
though the Leandro-Hay wards course is
not in good conditiou just iiow. The

The regular bimonthly meeting of the
California Associated Cycling. Clubs will
bt, held next Saturday evening at the
rooms of the Bay City Wheelmen.
The members ol the League of Ameri
can Wheelmen in this State seem so well
satisfied with their present board of offi
cers it seems likely they will aJI be re
elected. Chief Consul Kerrigan will have
no opposition if he will accept the office
again.
Harlow H. White will not accept re
nomination to the office of president of
the Associated Clubs. J. F. Hancock, the
secretary-treasurer, would like his position
for another term, and his good work dur- i
ing the past year entitles him to re-elec- j
tion. Henry F. Wynne is out for the
chief consulship of the league, and Lewis
C. Hunter would like to be secretary
treasurer.
The California Cycling Club will goto
Bolinas to-morrow, led by Captain Mayo.
The club will give a dance "the second
week in October.
. The first club run called by Captain Day
of the Bay City Wheelmen will be held
to-morrow to Haywarda, taking the 10
a. v. broad-gauge boat, to witness the
ciub's five^mile tandem race and tbe five
mile match race between H. A. Goddard

ion is that Goaaaid has the best of this
match, as it is to be against time, unpaced.
Invitations are out tor the initial hop of
the Alpha (laaies') Cycfinjc Club, to be
held at Hinman's Hall on Friday evening,
October 2.

his lieutenants. This makes the fifth cap
tain of a prominent club to resign this
season, the others being Carey of the Gar
den Citys, Pummer of the Bay City, Ram
age of the Santa Rosas and Fawceti of the
Olympic Wheelmen.
Captain White has called a run of the
Liberty Cycling Clab to Centerville for to
morrow on the 10 a. X. boat. The club's

the Associated Clubs' ten-mile race next
month.
The Reliance Club Wheelmen of Oak
land will hold a five-mile handicap road

The employes of Neustadter Bros, will
hold a five-mile handicap road race over
the San Leandro-Hay wards course to-mor
row morning at li o'clock sharp. As
much rivalry exists between the different
cyclers of the linn a spirited race is ex
pected. The entries and handicaps are:
J. Witman and Fritz ila/;er, 2 minutes;
Dave Easton, 1:45; J. brennan, 1:30; F.
Moore, 1:00; C. L. Ricketson, :45; C.
Langley, B. Barlow, T. H. Higgins,
scratch. The officials will be A. C. Mc-
Farland, M. Ballin and Mr. Hoeg.
If the managers of the proposed new
track at the Velodrome expect to interest
the public they must present some better
drawing-oara tor their opening day than a
return match race between Terrill and
Jones. These two have had it out and
Terrill won conclusively, and there will be
little interest attached to seeing them meet
again. Jones is a splendid rider and
popular with every one, but he lacks the
track experience of Terrill, who has had
two seasons upon the National circuit and, |
besides, is probably a bit speedier than nis |
handsome rival.
There will be four time prizes and j
twenty-five places given for the Associated
Clubs' annual ten-mile race, on October il.
The theater-party committee of the as- j
sociation, consisting of H. H. White, R.

THE ANGLER.
Where Good Fishing May Be Had
During the Last Month-
Anglers should not forcet that there are
only six or seven weeks more Jeft to them
to enjoy a favorite pastime.
Latest reports from Boca state that eood
fishing is now the rule, and that Messrs.
Mansfield, Bogard and Chesley have had
iirst-class sport on tbe main stream. The
Big Kulphur near Cloverdale should now
be in grand order, and a visit to that
stream will well repay any lover of fly
fishing.
Joun Butler and company are enjoying
good sport in Eel River, near Scotia. As
the anglers will not return until about the
middle of October tbe friends of Dr. yon
Hoffman and Frank Marcus expect to re
ceive several nice messes of steelbeads.
John Gallagher, the chamnion angler
of Oakland, has shipped several boxes of j
nice small fish to his friends. He has dis
covered that 6teelheads like cheusf. While
eating lunch one morning recently in a
fishing-boat Angler Jo>;n threw a small
piece of cheese overboard and to hi.-- sur
prise a large steelhead made a danh for
the stuff. Gallagher thought that cheese
would prove a killine lure and to his as
tonishment he discovered on trial that it
was just the right thing. Since having
made the discovery the champion of Ouk
land caught almost all of the large lish he
lanaed on cheese. Now Gallagher's
"cheese" fly is all the go with anglers who
whip and spoon the beautiful Eel.
\V. A. TilJey, the popular Railway Mail
Service clerk, left last Friday morning for
Los Angeles, where he intends spending a
day or two fishing for yellow-tail. Mr.
Tiiiey ha? invited his friends to be on the
lookout for him on Bunday morning, when
he expects to be able to show them, as he
says, "fish worth catching."
From tbe bulKy appearance and length
of tbe rodcase he carried we would infer
that ne would have no trouble (if be had
sufficient line) in landing a whale, Jet
alone a yell"W-taiL
James Wigmore, W. W. Richards, J.
Grogan of Oakland and Antonio Bertoiina
caught recently off Duxberry Reef 700
pounds of rocktish ranging in weight from
two to rive pounds. The fish were of the
gray-red and not of the pink-rea so fre
quently taken near tbe Farallones. This
is the catch of tbe season.

men at Stockton on September 9 last has
tauKht them a lesson, and In all future re
gattas nothing but the best-trained row
ers â winners of try-out races â will be
eligible to represent the various boating \
organizations. Already four-oared shell
racing, with a cockswain, is receiving fa
vorable mention, and some of ihecluos
have gone so far as to renovate old boats.
Every club is well supplied with tnis style
of boat. The Pioneers have three, the
Ariels four, the South Ends six, tbe Dol
phins four, the Alamedas three, the Stork
ion Atnletic Association two and the
Olympic Club Boating Annex three.
The new four-oared shell of the Olyra
pic Club is said to be the fastest on the
coast, but the South End Club hart a
paj>er-shell that was used by the old Far
raÂ«ut Club in the big Vallejo regatta held
some years ago, and witii which they out
distanced all competitors.
It is being noised about that the boat
clubs are going to vacate the old bridge
and seek quarters about the more placid
waters of Oakland Creek.
Tbe prizes won at the Stockton regatta
on September 9, will be presented to the
oarsmen in about three weeks. The asso
ciation has ordered that they be all medals
j instead of sundry articles of jewelry,
| owing to the races being championship
events.
The South End Club has received new
skiffs. They are a little narrower than
the ordinary styieof boat, and are said to
ue much faster.
Ti e Dolphin Boatins and Swimming
Club will hold an interclub regatta shortly.
Ihe races will be outrigger-skiff events
and the following have entered: T. J.
Sullivan. James (,'ronin, Al Ror.ard, Ed
Sullivan. Charles Farrel. W. O. Patch;
Dick Blennerhasset and W. yon Hadeln.
A special outrigger-skiff race will be
held on the same day between Tom Kee
nan and Tom Kennedy, both of the club.
FOOTBALL.
St. Mary's College vs. Santa Rosa
To-Dayâ Varsity Prospects.
The first football match of the season
will be played this afternoon at Central
Park, when the Bt. Mary's College team
will meet the Santa Rosa High School
eleven. Game wiil be called at 2:15
o'clock. The High School boys comprise
the strongest eleven in and about Santa
Rosa County, while the college team,
averaging ltiO pounds to'the man, stripped
weight, lias several dashing and gritty
players of some experience.

Tlip Stanfora freshmen by their victory
last Thursday over tiie junior class team,
made up largely of varsity player*, have;
shown that they are a promising lot to go i
against tne Berkeley freshmen on Noveni- '
ber 14. As a team they are the best foot
ball players that have entered at Palo
Alto in the last three years. To give them
all the practice possible before their big
match, the management wiil endeavor to
get games with Belmont school, San Ma
teo, San Francisco High School, Oaklai.d
High School and University of Nevada,
and, possibly, with other high schools and
with St. Ittary's College.
With ntariy liity men out on the Stan
ford gridiron' for daily practice this week,
and Coach Cross himself an active parti
cipant in the snappy play, prospects have
seldom looked brighter at Palo Alto thus
early in the season. And at Berkeley,
even though Butterworth will not arrive
until October 1 to taKe charge of his old
pupils, the men are turning put in large
numbers for the preliminary instruction
under Captain Rnnsome. Though both
universities have injured men on tne tem
porarily retired list, tbe customary cry of
despair has not yet been sounded to enlist
public sympathy, excuse a defeat or en
hance the glory of a victory.

CRICKET CHIRPS.
Outlook for a Match With the
Australians.
The probability is that after all the
lovers of cricket in Saa Francisco will
have a chance of seeing a match between
the Australians and a team representative
of the California Cricket Association. In
last week's Chirpa I announced that tbe
J eleven from the antipodes would have two
days to spend in this Cityâ the 13th and
14th of Octoberâ prior to their departure
, for Auckland. At the same time I sug
eested that another effort should be made
to bring about a match with local players.
! The suggestion has teen acted upon, for
â¢ the committee originally appointed to ar
! range a fixture, and. consisting of R. B.
Hofcue, captain of the Ala in ed as; W. Rob
ertson and R. H. Delatieid, a vice-president
' of the association, has decided, in collabo
i ration with the St. George's Club, to wire
a challenge. If the affair is arranged it
will come off at the Presidio grounds,
where a concrete pitch will be laid and
every arrangement made to secure for the
event a big success. Â .
The Australian team would be tho most
formidable antagonists ever pitted against
local talent. They played thirty-four
matches in England, of , which they won
nineteen, lost sixâ the other nine being
drawn. They have walked all over the
Philadelphia and New Jersey combina
! tions, and will doubtless make mincemeat
j of the Chicagoans. Consequently should
! the local players meet them and make a
I creditable showing, it would be the best
j possible tonic for the game throughout
l the coast.
Following are the season's batting aver
; age of the Australians: Battingâ S. E.
Gregory 31, J. Dowling 29, C. Hill 27, F. A.
, Iredaie 27, G.H. S. Trott (captain) 26, G.
Giffen 25, H. Donnan 23, H. Trumble 19.
1 H. Graham 18. J. J. Kelly 16. A. E. Johns
14. J. R. McKibben 7. Their bowlers are:
j McKibben, Trumble, Jones, Griffin, Trott
and Donnan â being the most
deadly of them all.
The highest individual scores of the
â  .English players, has just ben pub
j lished. The lone list is headed as follows:
Name. Match. Score.

hunters who have tramped the tutes for years
arc not at all enthusiastic over the outlook for
much shooting. They claim that there is very
little duck feed to this vicinity this year and
they attribute thie to the continued high water,
which has not only prevented the young tules
from springing up, but has allowed the carp
an opportunity to destroy vegetation. At the
present time all of the ponds are well stocked
with ducks, which have. been bred near them,
and for some weeks there will be good shoot
ing. In the lower river districts the first ar
rivals of the migratory flocks, composed of
teal and baldies, have been reported. ;
Will Young, Charlie Judd, Bod Callafaan,
Jake Miller and Frank Newbert have organ
ized a duck club to be dubbed "The Sawbllls,"
and have rented the Pocket south of Sacra

Pocket are alive. with home-bred mallards.
The Davlsville Una Club will give live-bird
shoot on the lOitt of the coming month and
many of the local men will run over and try
their luck.

Member! of the Sacramento Athletic Club are
sore at the decisions rendered against them
when their men appeared before the Rio Vista
Club last Saturday, and claim that their favor
ites, while they all had the best of the fights
got all the worst of the decisions. They con
tend that the referee claimed that the men
were even in the last round when their man
Louie Payen, made every lead and fought his
man all over the ring, hitting him when and
where he pleased; this they claim Is the sec
ond time that Payen has received the ' worst
end of the decision in his encounters with
Carter. They > also claim that W. :L. ; Henley
had his man all but out in his last round, and
yet the referee decided against. him. Henley

FOUND THE COOLGARDIE,
John A. Marshall Now on His
Way to Procure Eng
lish Capital.
How the First Big Strike Was Made
in Australia's Famous Gold
Diggirgs.
John A. Marshall, the discoverer of the
real value of the famous Coolgardie min
ing district in Australia, was in this City
last nicht, having arrived on the Mari
posu, but left on the overland train for
New York, whence he will embark on the
first available steamer for London to form
a syndicate to work vast auriferous de
posits on the Coromandel Peninsula in
New Zealand, which Mr. Marshall has
under bond.
Unlike his namesake, Captain Marshall,
who is credited with the discovery of gold
in California, the Australian miner in a
few short years has waxed fabulously
rich, and from almost absolute poverty on
the day he made bis first big strike has
become the possessor of mines that are
expected to produce the ransom of an
empire.
The Coolgardie mines were almost en
tirely unknown when Marshall and half
a dozen companions, who had heard re
ports of wages to be made there, packed
up their kits in the mining camp where
they were working and started for the
new diggings. Each took up his little
50x50 plat of ground and began delving.
Marshall and a companion took up
claims side by side and dug industriously
for several days, taking out about enough
to pay for food.
One day while Marshall was sitting on
the edge of his neighbor's pit, eating his
dinner and watching him picking away
aj the earth, the former suddenly saw
something in the character of tbe earth
that was being removed tbat told his ex
perienced eye tbat a rich pocket was near.
The other man, not being a practical
miner, paid no attention to the indica
tions and soon began to work away from
them.
The next day when he began gmmblinsr
to Marshall about his ill luck the latter
offered him three ounces of gold for his
claim, saying that he desired to enlarge
his own workings. The man refused, but
a day or two later, after a particularly
poor clean-up, ne accepted the tbree
ounces, and on the following morning
packed his belongings and left. Marshall
at once went to work on the indications
he had seen, and by following them with
the utmost care first with his jarkknife
and later with pick ana shovel soon un
earthed a pocket from which he took
$60,000 in about forty-eight hours of actual
work.
He kept the matter as secret as possible
and had found several smaller pockets be
fore the news got abroad and the rush for
the new diggings began. A sale of his
claim netted Marshall many thousands
more, and later he tried other mining dis
tricts, usually with much success, so that
his fortune soon amounted to hundreds of
thousands. The faoie of the Coromandei
diggings took Marshall to New Zealand,
and realizing that a large outlay of capital
would bring heavy returns he determined
to play for a big stake, and bonding sev
eral extensive properties started for Eng
land to see the money kings of that coun
try.

A New Bidder Successful Before the
Commissioners.
To the surprise and chagrin of a ma
jority of the bidders the contract for print

Woodward & Co., at 299Â£ cents per name.
Several days ago, when the original bids

the lowest, but the protests of the other
bidders tbat Heringbi was not a union
printer and would not be able to do the
work Q(i time prevented an award, and it
was finally decided to advertise for new
bids to be presented by union printers
only.
These were opened yesterday as follows:
W. A. Woodward & Co., 2Q% cents; W. I.
Bterett, 35^ cents; Hicks, J udd & Co., 40Â»Â£

DR. WOODS WOULD
BEST HER HUSBAND
Because He Insisted on
Seeing His Little
Children.
SHE USED A HORSEWHIP
Sad Story of a Mild-Manoered
and Most Forgiving
Spouse.
ORDEBED OUT OF THE HOUSE.
Result of an Order of Conrt Award
ing to Woods His Two
Children.
According to an affidavit filed yesterday
by Joseph L. Woods, who is employed by
the Union Assurance Company, he is a
greatly abused man, and his ex-wife, who
is a practicing physician of Berkeley, only
lacks the legal right to male attire to
achieve anything commonly supposed to
ba man's prerogative.
The parties were married over twenty
years ago and lived together until 1891,
when Mrs. Woods deserted her husband.
He subsequently obtained a divorce and
by the terms of the decree was ordered to
pay $75 per month toward the support of
his four children. He was also given per
mission to visit the children whenever he
sOj desired.
Although Woods more than kept his
part of the agreement, his wife was in the
habit of flying into a rage almost every
time she saw him. Usually when he vis
ited his home to see his offspring his wife
ordered him out of the house.
June 22 Judge Seawell modified the
original decree of divorce to the extent of
granting the plaintiff the custody of the
two younger children. But his wife ab
solutely refused to let him see the chil
dren at all, and when he persisted in
calling for that purpose he says she cow
bided him. The whipping took pli on
July 12.
Recently Woods has been in straitened
circumstances and has been unable to pay
the s7s per month alimony. His creditors
are pressing him aud he desired to mort
gage his home on Ashby avenue, Berke
ley, which is occupied by his wife and
family. Dr. Wilhemina E. J. Woods,
under which title his ex-spouse sails, re
fuses, however, to allow him to do so, be
cause of the back alimony he owes.
Woods therefore yesterday applied for an
order further modifying the divorce de
cree. He a*ks that the wife be allowed to
keep the house and he be freed from pay
ing further alimony, or that she be made
to release it, so that be can mortgage it to
meet his obligations.
When the matter was called in Depart
ment 1 yesterday Dr. Woods was not ready
to go on with -the hearing, so the matter
went over for two weeks.

Suicide.
R. M. Kennedy, an old and wealthy
resident of Denver, has written Clerk
Burke of the Occidental Hotel inquiring
about his son, J. M. Kennedy, who for
merly lived here, and who on July 13
strangely disappeared.
On that day young Kennedy waa in
Angels Camp and took passage on the
Angels stage for San Francisco. None of
his friends have ever seen him since, nor
has any one, as far as known, received a
line from him.
It is thought that he may be dead ; that
he probably committed suicide, for he was
very despondent. He had been losing
money steadily, until a comfortable for
tune had been dissipated, and he was liv
ing on the cbanee contributions of friends.
He had also been drinking heavily, and
this added to his unhappiness.
Kennedy had had a strange career, as
was told yesterday at the Occidental by
A. N. Butts, tbe mining man, who is de
veloping properties at Angels. He had
known him at Salt Lake, where, as a real
estate dealer and general speculator, in
the early nineties, he had acquired a com
petency of about $50,000.
He lost this, as Mr. Butts says, at the
time of tbe decadence of the Salt Lake
boom. He became despondent and at
tempted suicide with a revolver, the ball
passing entirely through his body. How
he escaped death was a miracle, but after
a long time he recovered from the wound
and came to San Francisco.
The young man reached here nearly
three years ago, and shortly afterward
opened a real estate office in the 600 block
on Market street. He remained here a year
and a half or two years, and then went to
Angels Camp.
He hoped to catch on in the mining
boom, and it is said he was staked in
small sums by friends. He was unsuc
cessful there, however, and drank rather
heavily, so much so that it simply inter
fered with his work. Kennedy borrowed
money from Mr. Butts till he owed him
probably $75. Finally Mr. Butts bought a
ticket for him to San FrancLco. That
was the last seen of him.
"I believe now that he is dead," said
Mr. Butts, yesterday, as he perused the
letter that had been given him from R. M.
Kennedy of Denver. "Of couTse it is pos
sible that he has wandered away to some
remote mining camp, but as he had
previously attempted suicide in Salt Lake,
and bad often at Angels threatened
to take his life, I think likely he has
either drowned himself or used a revolver
fatally.
"His father is known as Dr. Kennedy in
Denver. He is tbe patentee of a medicine
regularly sold. He is an old resident of
Denver and owns a good deal of real es
tate and mining property. He is vice

Mr. Butts is doing what he can to find

beine able to do so.
TWO DEATHS FROM GAS.
F. TT. Heinze Takes His Own Life and
Harry L. Kinjr Dies Acci
dentally.
Two cases of gas asphyxiation were re
ported at the Morgue yesterday. The first
was that of F. W. Heinze. 191 Hyde street,
who, on account of troubles, real or fan
cied, committed suicide. The second,
Harry L. King, met death accidentally.
Heinze is a married man, but not mucti
is known of him. He has been separated
from his wife for 6ome time and has beeu
living at the address already given. Yes
terday morning his landlady, Mrs. Simon
son, detected the odor of escaping pas and
traced it to Heinze's room. The doors
and windows were closed and from the
gas jet ran a rubber tube which the sui
cide had placed in his mouth. Thega3
was turned on with full force. On the
bureau was found a note written In Ger
man which, translated, reads:
To Margaret Heinze: Do you remember that
year when we stood before the altar and you
took my nand to be true to me during all your
life?
You were no wife tor a husband. The chil
dren ought to be ashamed of themselves and
also the son-in-law. Attluger.
Mrs. Simonson, at whose house Heinza
lived, says she never heard him speak of
his family and consequently knew noth
ing of the difficulty or where Mrs. Heinze
lived.
from all appearances the death ol
Henry L. King was purely accidental.
He was a widower, 84 years old, and lived
with his daughter, Mra. Latham, 2001 Cali
fornia street. The latter says that her
father must have endeavored to turn off
the gas and left the stopcock partly open
after the light had been extinguished.
The investigations of Deputy Coroners
Hatlet and Mclnnes bear out this preÂ«
sumption.
The Diiuoml Trust.
Judge Slack yesterday ordered the executors
of the will of \V. n. Diniond to pay the trus
tees of the Diniond trust $22,540, proceeds of
the trust property which came into General
Dimond's hands before he died.

NATURE.
Its Abuse and Its Re=
venge.
How many unfortunate men have vio-
lated the laws of nature and are now pay-
ing the penalty?
Some have been \ addicted to foolish
habits in their youth; some have over-
indulged later in life; while others have
wearied themselves into unmanly weak-
ness over bad crops, business reverses or
financial failure. In one way or another
they have overdrawn on their stock of
vitality, which is getting dangerously low.
As a consequence they have lost their
grip on life. , Every little annoyance
seems a mountain of despair. Every
speck in the heavens' looks like an over-
whelming shadow. Every cherished am-
bition is dead, and the poor, suffering
victim almost wishes he were dead too.
He thinks of suicide.
Men, there is help for you. Don't brood
over your disgraceful weakness any longer,
but get strength at once. Get back to life.

' JTFW YORK, N. V., Sept 26.-Stocks at the
opening were Inclined to weakness, and a frac
tional recession was noted in the usually active
Us: on account of a moderate decline in prices in
London. The weakness was short-lived, however,
and before 1 1 o'clock the market developed in
creased strength. No reasons were assigned for
the buying, which is still attributed to the easier
condition of the money market, the influx of gold
and the improvement in the business situation.
Commission-houses had more to do than for some
time past, and 8 number of stocks whicn have
been neglected for months figured in the dealings.
Confidence was stimulated by the heavy arrivals
of gold to-day, and by reports that further amounts
would be forwarded from London next week.

CHICAGO. 11.1,, Sept. 25.â Liverpool entered
an objection to advancing wheat prices this morn
ing and this market, which yesterday displayed
symptoms, of waning enthusiasm, sustained the
objection. The large holders emphatically deny
selling auyof the wheat bought earlier in the week,
but that the smaller fry were not so tenacious was
plainly apparent. The scalpers used all exertions
to force this market up during the morning, but
the instant they ceaseu buying prices sagged.
Receipts In the Northwest were 722 cars, against
1043 las: Friday and 841 a year ago. Chicago re- !
ceived 236 cars Â» nd inspected out 73,473 bushels.

DUN'S KEVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, N. V., Sept. 25.â R. G. Dun & Co.
will say to-morrow In their weekly review of trade:
A very moderate and yet distinct improvement Is
seen, no longer only in mo buying of material!,
which continue and stiffen* prices, but also in
products of some industries in the money mar
kets and in exports of stapes. It is as yet little
more than a step toward better things, but has
already started some' important works and '
prompted a â  few considerable contracts. While
gain In working force is not great, It ems
clear that for the (Irs: line in many months there
is some net gain. There is an important change
in the produce markets and Improvement In
wheat, which rose sharply Thursday and Friday,
closing 5%e higher for the week.
Iteports of crops abroad were supposed obe
the chief cause, as visible supplies In this country
increased largely, but for the first time since July
1 Western receipts fell below those of the same
week last year. Atlantic exports, flour included
were for the week a little mor,e than a year aÂ«o,
for September 3,000,000 bushels more and 21.807 -
553 bushels since July 1. against U.I -8.30* ast
year. If there should come an unusual foreign
demand it would make a great difference with
future business. Cotton advanced an eighth a
week ago, hut lost 3-16 c, and with full receipts
might have cone further but for resumption of
work by several Important mills. Much less than
the full capaci yof mills Is working, and the de
mand for goods has been quite slack, with a de
cline of a sixteenth In print cloths, but in other
goods recent advances are maintained.
Speculative buying of wool does no- abate, sales
for four weeks having been '.14,844,400 pounds
against 23,758,970 last year, but no gain in prices
Is reported. Few woolen-mills are resuming the
belated demand for heavy g. ods coustitu.lng most
of the gain visible, but manufacturers show confi
dence that more goods will be wanted when the
iutnre is more clear. ' ;:. v
Finished produc:sof Iron meet more Inquiry and
the placing of contracts for 15,000 ions oi steel for
three new tsattle-uhlps. for one lar-e building here
and for several i. ridges explains the starting of two
or three works, but after such months as have
passed a little business Is a gain. â¢
A sharp fall of $ . per ton sin low phosphorous
pig and a slight rise In gray forge at Plttsburg and
< In steel platen are the only changes noted in prices.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1896.
Exports of 50,01)0 tons of rails this year at prices
far i.clow those current here and 25,000 tons p if
to Kncland at $H 9.H at Manchester, rrei-r'it being
at leas: $3 15, indicate unloading a surplus abroad
to avoid weakening mantels here, Tin platts a c
slig t y lower, by home consumption to $3 66,
â gainst $3 90 for foreign, and tin is a shade weaker
at 13c, copper at $10 75 and lead at $2 80.
There is no change In the boot and shoe manu
facture.
Failures for the week have been 315 in the
United States, against 216 last year, and 39 In
Canada, against 50 last year.

COALâA local circular says: ' "During the week
there have bten 10 arrivals fjom the northern col
lieries with 22,400 tons of Coal, and one from
Newcastle with 2465 tons. The above arrivals are
ample for the week's consumption, in addition to
a liberal supply piled up here in yard, and several
cargoes of foreign due this month. Business
In -his line still remains quiet, specially so
with small dealers, who are awal ing the Incoming
of rainy weather to Increase their sales for bouse
purposes. .-ales for steam, uses continue fair, but
the prices â  named to large, consumers are so low
hat the margins for profit are merely nominal.
The profits on steam Coals should be greater, when
It Is considered the large I capital invested in valu
able property for yard use, the extensive stocks to
be carried, the cost of handling m bulky article ;
, like Coal, In and out of yard, also a large clerical
force In office and solicitors and collectors outside.
These In the aggregate loot up a very large per
centage on the cost of a low-priced and very bulky
article like CoaL Th Australian list is swelling,
which signifies low-priced fuel for some time to
come. Tfce low freights ruling enable importers to
make generou* figures to heavy consumers. Our

: The mills -will be stopped Thurs- ;
â¢ â¢ day, Friday and >at*Urday this :
. : week. Work will be resumed :
: >>on<lay, the 28th, as usual, but ;
'â  owing to the present . condition â¢
:â  of trade, it may be necessary for :
; some time hereafter to run only ;
- â¢ three days a week. ;
The above is a copy of a notice posted
on the door of the California Cotton-mills,
at Twenty-t ird avenue, East Oakland,
to-day. The order affects 300 men, women
and children who have been employed at
the establishment up to the present time.
To-morrow all the machinery in the
big mills will be silent and 200 people
will be forced to witness the approach
of winter with the knowledge that their
bread-locker may often be empty and their
little ones' mouths be unfilled when they
ask for food.
One of the foremen of the company said
to-day: "Trade has much to do with it.
for in this country we have to pay living
wages, and with fr c trade we are thrown
into competition with the Japanese cotton
made by miilhands who receive 7 yen a
month, or in American money about $4 20.
The hard times has affected all branches
of trade, and with this competition our
line feels them keenly.
"The books of the mill show that the
average wage paid to the 300 hands is
$473 55 each a year, or nearly $40 a month.
If it becomes necessary to run on half time
the wages will be reduced accordingly,
leaving not quite $20 monthly for support
ing each employe."
Having to 'meet the issue squarely
the wufre-earners of the California
Cotton-mills have carefully compiled
a table showing ' why protection of
home industry iÂ« an absolute necessity,
and were just distributing the result of
their investigations when the doleful no
tice was posted on the doors.
The facts are set forth by the â¢'wage
earners" on large full-sheet posters and
are as follows:
â¦â¢The wages paid by the California Cot
ton-miils Company for labor in producing
their exhibit shown at Home-pro nets'
Exposition, Mechanics' Pavilion, 1896,
was $473 55; in Canada the wages would
be $354 75, in Great Britain $272 90, in
Germany $184 68, in France 168 65, in
Mexico $159 30, in British India $68 65, in
Japan $38 23.
â¢â¢A comparative rate of wages paid is
different countries where cotton and
woolen goods are manufactured shows
experienced loom-fixers, carders and
weavers (men) are paid per day of ten
hours each, twenty-six days to the month,
valued in United States money: United
States, $2. per month $52; Canada, $150,
$39; Great Britain, 4 shillings 9 pence,

DEMOCRACY HAS
LOST ITS HEART
No Hope for the Twenty-
Seventh Senatorial
District.
MTIKE MAY TAKE IT.
The Nomination Has Been Gen
erally Spurned Since the
Convention.
STRATTON'S VICTORY IS SURE.
Fusion Peop'e Show That They Have
No Faith Whatever in Their
Own Promises.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway. Sept. 25. j
Any Democrat or Populist who will
promise to stay by his present belief till
after the election can have the Senatorial
nomination of his dual party from the
Twenty-seventh District. . It is going a
begging and all to whom it is offered are
spurning it. In places where men meet
and discuss politics officially the people
whom the parties would have to serve
them urge pressure of business. On the
street when approached on the subject
they turn their heads significantly and say
beneath their breath "nit."
While so much is being said by the few
about the bright prospects of the Demo
cratic-Populist alliance the followers of
these two parties in this county have lost
deart. They are not making even the
semblance of a campaign and are so hope
lessly divided that neither side can move
without exciting the antagonism of their
opponents.
This spirit Is shown most definitely in
the Twenty-seventh Senatorial District,
Although the nominee, if one be found
willing to take the empty honor, will be a
fusion candidate, there isnot any evidence
of confidence that he wouid have any re
mote prospect of winning our. Every
effort has been made to induce Henry Mc-
PiKe to accept the nomination, but al
though it was presented to him on a silver
salver with due obeisance he refused to
bite and be ultimately bitten. Dr. Wool
sey was proposed, Out since he was dis
charged from his long service as surgeon
to tLe Southern Pacific he is an anti
railroad man and was not wanted. Be
sides this, he has sense. A few very san
guine Democrats quietly breathed the
name oi W. W. Foote, but if the whi-per
were ever heard by the tx-Raii road Com
missioner it died right there, for nothing
more was heard of it.
Now events are again shaping toward
its acceptance after all by Mr. Me.Pike.
It is ea-y to understand the feelings of
the gentlemen who are not anxion? to
oppose the Republican candidate. With
out any additional gain since 1894 the Re
publican majority over all the other can
uidates is 814.
When Senator Earl was elected the vote
stood: Earl, 3400; Ward (D.), 1588; Kel
sey (Pop.), 801; Mead (Pro.), 197. This
gave Earl a plurality of 1812 and a clean
majority of 814. If the hopes of the
fusion party are as liberal as their speeches
they would wipe out that 814 twice over,
but the allied parties in this county are
using truth very economically during this
campaign.
The nomination of Howard E. Wright
of Berkeley is being opposed by some on
the ground that be has not resided a suf
ficient length of time in the Assembly
district for which the Republicans nomi
nated him. The matter is being looked
into.
OPPOSED BY BOSSES.
Judge Wood Telia Why He Did Not
Go Before the Recent Con
vention.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 25.â Fred V.
Wood, Judge of the Police Court,
has decided to stand as an indepen
dent candidate for re-election, and
his ' friends are at work preparing
the necessary petition which will be re
quired to get his name on the ticket. Re
garding his reason for not going before the
convention for renomination, he has the
following to say:
"I found the bosses were against me.
Over two-thirds of the delegates expressed
themselves as favorable to me, and said I
should be renominated, but I knew these
pledges of support would not hold under
ihe system of trading that prevailed in
the convention, and so I would nut ailow
niv name to go before the convention,
knowing that the leaders of the same wero
lighting me.
"Since I have occupied the position of
Police Judge of this city, I have
striven to the utmost to my duty. I have
tried to be w holly unbiased in my judg
ment, and i bave not allowed any
outside influence to sway me in the
performance ot what I bave consid
ered my duty. As for the record I bave
made, I leave that tor others to say. I
know that during my two years' occu
pancy of tbis position I have made some
enemies, but I believe that I will receive
the support of the law-abidine element of
the city. Since I have been here lao not
think that any one can say that there has
been any neediess delay of justice.
"I know that my course has not met
with ibe approval. of some of the so-called
leaders of the Republican party, but I do
not propose to allow them to dictate my
course in the discbarge of my duty. I
prefer rather to retire from office than to
allow my judgment to be influenced by
the position, political or otherwise, of
those whose cases are submitted to me for
decision. "

Jovial Turners Appear in Burnt Cork
and Costume.
OAKLAND, Cal., Sept. 25.â Germania
Hall was well filled to-night with former
subjects of Kaiser Wilhelm, who fully ap
preciated the jokes and songs of their fel
low-countrymen who had donned the
burnt cork and wig for the benefit of the
local Turn Verein. Al Kaehler acted as in
terlocutor and was assisted by Max llor
winski and Charles Wedde, bones, and
Dolph Fischer and Edwin Horwinski,
tambos.
The local jokes were first cla.ss and thor
oughly enjoyed by the audience, who ap
plauded every hit.
*'Bei Nicht Bos" was sung by Carl Frank.
He was followed by Max Horwinski with
"I'll Never Do It Again," which captured
the audience. Other well-known songs
followed, after which came a rehearsal, in
troducing Willie Rice, a boy cornet vir
tuoso of ability ; the African dwarf, Com
modore de Bike, the smallest educated
savage on earth sang a song and danced
to the tune; Mile. Blackface, premier
danseuse, was impersonated by Max Hor
wiuski in the latest French stage costume ;
Paul Sabati, a tragedian, gave impersona
tions of half a dozen nationalities.
He then gave an exhibition of fireworks,
acting each piece out. He was followed
by a fight, "Ireland vs. China." The
scene was on the racetrack and the secon is
treated the principals as they dia horses
after the races. It ended in a free-for-all
fight with all bands mixed up in buckets
of water, bottles, etc. The entertainm-nt
concluded with selections by the Mandolin
orchestra and a ridiculously mnny and
original pantomime farco entitled "The
New Boy or Scenes in a Doctor's Office."
HISTORY OF A DAY.
Alameda County Happenings Told in
Brief I hapter*.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, \
908 Broadway, Sept. 25. |
In the Seventh Ward the Populists and
Democrats have concluded to j"in forces and
hold joint meetings during the campaign.
They will uniform a inarching corps.
A meeting ol the Republican Congressional
Committee will be called for some day early
next week, the object being to arrange for Mr.
Hilboru'B canvass ol the district.
The Democratic County Central Committee
has -ecured rooms 1 and 2 in tne building at
1004 Broadway and J. Leo Park has been
installed as secretary and entered upon his
duties. The Populists' headquarters are lo
cated in the adjoining rooms.
Persons who have moved from one precinct
to another since they registered this year
should attend, without delay, to the matter of
having their new residence set down oa the
register. Under the new law this is necessary
to save their votes.
A company of League of the Cross Cadets is
being iormed in Berkeley at St. Joseph's
Church. The matter is in charge of William
Armstrong, who already has almost enough,
members to form the company.
Hart Hyatt North has filed his certificate of

Pheips, H. D. Eliason, C. B. Morgan, W. H.
Quinn and G.S.Meredith as his committee,

ter have been submitted for publication by

EXECTTTIVE DEPARTMENTâ MATOB.
What is the Mayor of a city T f
The chief magistrate and head executive
officer.
What are his powers generally?
lie has general supervision of all the depart
ments of the city government. He is responsi
ble to the people for the proper execution of
the laws, and, therefore, he is vested with the
appointment and removal of the head 3 of the
departments.
Is tins so In all the cities of the United
Btate6?
It is true In all cities of the United States
that have adopted new charters in recent
years.
How is it in San Francisco?
Under our present consolidation act the
Mayor has been gradual. y S'orn of all his pow
ers by the Legislature and Supervisors, until
he is now practically a cipher iv the City gov
ernment.
CHAPTER IX.
THE MATOK UNDER THE CHARTER.
What will be the Mayor's duties under the
Charter?
He will be the chief executive officer ot 9an
Francisco, and shall have general supervision
of all its departments.
Mention some of his special duties.
He must see that all the ordinances of the
Ci.y ana County are enforced, that public
franchises are not violated aud that all con
tracts with the City are faithfully kept.
What are some 01 his responsibilities?
He must have the books of each department
experied every six months, and see that all
departments are honestly and economically
administered.
What will bo his power over the Board of
Supervisors?
The veto power, requlrinc the vote of three
fourths of the Supervisors to overcome, will
be restored to him.
Name all the officials appointed by the
Mayor under the new charter.
City Attorney, Library Trustees, Board of
Public Works, Board of Health and the Com
miss.oners of Police, Fire, Election, Park and
Civil Service.
In case the constitution of California is
amended will he not tnen appoint other of
ficia.s?
Yes; he will then appoint the County Clerk,
Recorder, Tax Collector, Coroner, Jusiices of
the Peace, Police Judges and Board of Educa
tion.
Will this leave any City officials to be
elected?
Yes; Supervisors, M'iyor, Auditor, Treasurer,
AssesÂ»or, District Attorney, Sher ff. Superin
tendent of Schools and .Superior Judges.
What power will the Mayor have to remove
officials?
He may remove officials appointed by him,
but cannot remove any elected official.
Will the Mayor appoint or teinove any
clerks or employes in tne City government ?
Outside of Mn own secretary he cannot ap
point or remove any clerks or employes.
Hiw are the clerks and employes appointed,
promoted and removed ?
The civil service rules and regulations pro
vide for their appointment and promotion
upon merit and ihelr removal for cause only.
CHAPTER X.
CAN THE MAYOE BE A DICTATOR ?
Can the Mayor become an autocrat or dicta
tor under the new charter?
It is impossible, because his tenure is
limited to two years, and none of his appoint
ments can exoeed four years. The Commis
sioners retire in rotation, so that only two can
be appointed by each Mayor after the boards
arf once organized.
Could the Mayor become a political "boss" ?
Neither the Mnyor nor any one else Could be
come a "boss" under the new charter.
Why wilt that by the case? â¢
Because the civil service article in the
charter will be the deathblow to political
patronage.
Who would be the Mayor under the new
charter?
The . ffice would be the highest honor in the
gift of the people, and our most worthy and
capable citizens would aspire to it.
Can the people be trusted to elect the right
man?
The people very rarely err in electing wqrthy
citizens to the first office of trust and re
sponsibility.
What kind of Mayors nas San Francisco had ?
The record of the past Mayors of San Kran
eisco is creditable to our City and infinitely
superior to that of our past Boards of Super
visors.

THE CARNIVAL BENEFIT.
A Good Programme Prepared for Next
1 riday Night.
The programme for the benefit of the
Carnival of the Golden Gate to be given by

tion of boxing by W. Cook and W.
Donigan will be the second event. A six
round contest with decision will follow
between Hawkins and Jack King. Two
exhibition catch-as-catch-can wrestling

round contest.
Thti event of the evening will be the
eight-round contest between Frank

have an unbroken strine of victories to
their credit, and an interesting bout may
De looked for.
It may be necessary to utilize the permit
for two additional bouts be.ore the de
cision is arrived at, but. in any event a
decision will be rendered. There is already
a considerable scramble for seats, which
will be placed on sale during the < oming
week at the box-office of the People's
Palace. r
Stabbed With a Screwdriver.
Charles H. Brown, a laborer living at 619^
Mission street, was stabbed in the back of the
neck last evening by Adrian Garsson, the pro
prietor of the lodging-house, who used a
screwdriver for a weapon. Brown owed the
landlord about $7 for rent, and when he
returned from work Mrs. Brown said that
GHrssonwas in their rooms taking the doors
off the hinges. A quarrel between the two
men followed, which resulted in Brown being
stabbed with the screwdriver. His wound,
which is not serious, was dressed at the P.e
ceiving Hospital. Garsson was arre-ted.

NON-PARTISANS
AT WORK AGAIN
Nominations for Superior
and Police Judges and
Justices.
ONE JUDGE LEFT OVER.
Dunne Ran His Opponent a
Close Race and Will Rest
Till Monday.
THE QUESTION OF POLITICS.
Delegate Webster Afraid That the
Ticket Might Tilt Up With Too
Many of a Kind.
For Superior Judgesâ John Hunt, J.
C- B. Hebbard. J. F. Finn.
Nomination of the fourth Judge laid
over.
For Police Judgesâ C. A. Low, Charles
T. Conlau, H. L. Joachimsen, George
A. Proctor.
For Justioen of the Peace â O. K. Mc-
Murray, J. Â£. Barry, Frank 11. Kerri
gan, Marshal "Wood worth, William Â£.
White.
The Non-Partisans had a cheerful ses
sion last night, winding up at half-past 11
o'clock. Owing to the rule requiring two
thirds of all the votes cast for a nomina
tion, the creator part of the time was spent
in balloting.
The proceedings were opened by the
committee on headquarters being au
thorized to rent a suite of two rooms in
the Baldwin Hotel Annex at $60 per
month.
The committee on judiciary reported
recommending the nomination of Hunt,
Hebbara, Finn and Rhodes Borden for
Judges of the Superior Court; Low, Con
lan, Proctor and Joachimsen for Judees of
the Police Court, and McMurray, Kerri
gan, Barry, \vood worth and O'Gara for
Justices of the Peace.
The only incident to give a disinterested
spectator tne impression that some of the
members of the convention were suspected
of Splaying into the hands of Sam Kainey
was the inquiry of Delegate Webster as
to the respective politics of the candidates
as their names were chalked on the black
board. He was good naturedly informed
that as the convention was non-partisan,
nobody cared wnat were the politics of the
candidates.
The report of the committee on muni
cipal nominations recommended the fol
lowing:
Treasurer â A. C. Widber.
Treasurer (unexpired term) âA. C.
Widber.
Auditorâ William Broderick.
Surveyor â Charles S. Tilton.
Tax Collector â James N. Block.
City and County Attorneyâ Harry T.
Creswell.
Superintendent of Streets â George P.
Wetmore.
Frank J. Sullivan in placing the name
of Frank H. Donne in nomination for the
Superior Judgeship remarked that he re
gretted to say that the past history of
Superior Judges of the City and County
of San Francisco had not been what it
should.
"We have heard many tales," he con
tinued, "about some Superior Judges â
tales whicn, I am sorry to say,
were founded upon fact. Tales
of bribery, of excesses committed in this
City; tale* of men who on a small salary
were spending thousands of dollars. It
is time that this practice should be
stopped. Our candidates should be above
suspicion, above the reach of corporate in
fluences and of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. The citizens of San Francisco look
to you to give us men who will do their
duty without fear or favor.
"Many gentlemen have been mentioned
here to-night by the committee on ju
diciary who have been faithful public
servants, and I must name one who was
horn in this State and who demonstrated
by his conduct as Justice ol the Peace that
he could hold tne scales of justice equally
between the rich and the poor. He has
held hi;h office in the Native Sons of
the Golden West and he will leave behind
him an uucontaminated lecord â Frank H.
Dunne."
Mr. Dunne's name was liberally ap
plauded.
Julius Kahn said that a fearless, up
right, incorruptible and honest judiciary
was what was wanted for San Francisco.
The gentleman whose name he was about
to present stood for honesty, integ
rity, uprightness and probity. Ho
had occupied his present position
on the bench for six years, dur
ing which time he had been called upon
to decide questions of the eravest impor
tance and in every instance he snowed
that "he vras a man who Ids duty knew,
and knew the right, and knowing, dared
maintain it" It mattered not whether
the people who appeared before
him were powerful politicians or potent
corporations, he administered the law ac
cording to the evidence and as ho found it
and understood it. His decisions had been
approved by the highest tribunal in this
State and the Nation. The convention
would be performing a great puolic duly
and would make r.o mistake if it nomi
nated Judge Hehbard.
Delegate Le Breton nominated John F.
Finn.
Mr. Webster called attention to the fact
of the politics of the candidates, and the
danger of indorsing or nominating an un
due proportion of the members of one of
the political parties. He, therefore, sug
gested that in voting for the four Judges
no member should vote for more than two
of the same party.
Mr. Le Breton remarked that when the
convention met two years ago it did not
consider the politics of the candidates at
all.
Joseph Leggett, John Hunt, T. W. Now
lin and Rhodes Borden were also named.
The first ballot resulted as follows-
Hunt 37, Hebbard 42, Finn 35, Borden 29,
Leggett 6, Sanderson 4, Dunne 27, New
lin 4.
Hunt, Hebbard and Finn were declared
nominated, and a second ballot was taken
for the fourth nominee, as follows:
Borden 24, Dunne 22. A two-third ma
jority being necessary, a third ballot was
taken with the following result: Borden
26. Dunne 20. Under the rules the matter
was laid over until the next meeting.
The ballot on Police Judges came up
next and resulted as follows: C. A. Low
43. Charles T. Con lan 81, H. L. Joachim
ben 38, Georce A. Proctor 38, J. A. Spi
nÂ«ttl 12. Finlay Cook 17.
Messrs. Low, Co.ilan, Joachimsen and
Proc.cr were declared the nominees.
The firs', ballot on Justices of the Peace
stood as follows: O. K. McMurray 41, J.
E. Barry 34, Arthur Brand 28, William E
White 21, A. J. Fritz 15. Marshall Wood
worth a, Frank H. Kerrigan 39, John
O'Gara 24.
McMurray, Barry and Kerrigan were
declared the nominees.
Ihe becond ballot for the two other
Justices resulted as follows: White 28,
Woodworth 28, Brand 18, O'Gara 10,
Friiz 5.
The third ballot resulted: White 33,
Wood worth 40, Brand 9. White aryi
Wood worth were declared nominated.
Tlie convention thereupon adjourned
until 8 p. m., Monday.
TO PRISON FOR LIFE.
The Heavy PenaMy Imposed on Peter
JDucoy, Murderer, by .Judge
Wallace.
Peter Ducey, who was on Wednesday
last convicted of murder in the second de
gree for having slain his aunt, K;ite Me-
Keever, one day last May, was yesterday
sentenced to imprisonment forlile.
Jud.e Wallace's action in thus impos
ing the maximum penalty upon the man
who, in a tit of drunken anger, slew his
best friend, has been thought severe, in
view oi the fact that the jury came very
near bringing in a verdict of manslaughter
instead of murder.
SUICIDE OF AN UNKNOWN.
A Laborer Cuts His Throat With a
Venknife.
An unknown roan, apparently of French
descent, about 45 years of age, committed
suicide by cutting nis throat with a pen
knife in the St. George House, 812 Kearny
street, last evening.
Tne deceased, who was evidently a
laboring man, called at the lodging-house
about 8 o'clock. He was assigned a room
on the second floor, near the office, and
after paying for the accommodation re
tired.
About 10 o'clock the proprietor was at
tracted by groans coming from the un
known's room, and, finding the door un
locked, walked in and discovered his guest
lying on the bed, his throat cut from ear
to ear.
The police patrol wai summoned and
the dying man was removed to the Re
ceivinsr Hospital, where he died in a few
minutes.
The body was removed to the Morsrue,
and when the clothes were searched $140
in gold was found. There was nothing
found, however, that would assist in es
tablishing the suicide's identity.
GOGGIN IS IN LONDON,
He Is Earning a Precarious
Living in Old Age as a
Printer.
His Story in This City Ends With the
Transfer of His Van Ness
Avenue Home.
The real estate transactions recorded in
this City during the past week include
the transfer of the former home of Ed
mund W. Goggin on Van Ness avenue,
near Jackson street, to T. B. Valentine,
by Joseph E. Brien, commissioner. This
marks the close of Goggin's somewhat
meteoric career in this City, and, coupled
with other facts, furnishes a good object
lesson for the instruction of the young.
The other facts are that Goegin's sec
ond wile has left him, and that, from the
position which He occupied in this City as
superintendent of the large printing es
tablishment of Francis <fc Valentine, he
has fallen to eking out a somewhat pre
carious living in London as a printer.
His income from this work is very low.
When he was in the flush of prosperity he
had two homes â the residence on Van
Ness avenue and the" property known as
Shamrock Lodge at Belvedere. His income
for many years outside of a stated salary
of $50 per week was large.
He came to San Francisco from Aus
tralia, worked for Bacon for awhile, and
then, about 1874. went to work for Francis
<fe Valentine. Ha had considerable ac
quaintance with theatrical people, and
this gave him command of much theatri
cal advertising. He was connected with
Francis & Valentine until something les*
than two years ago, when it was discov
ered tbfe he had used the money of the
firm for his own purposes. He fled the
country, and was supposed until now to
be in Scotland, but an old acquaintance
met him in a London street and brought
the news to this City.
Gopgin is now about 01 years old. His
old acquaintances think that he will not
be able ever to retrieve his finances,
for his wages cannot more than afford him
a living. The Van Ness avenue property,
which has just been transferred to T. B.
Valentine, was expensive, the house
having cost about $11,000. Goggin never
completely paid for it. He borrowed
money from a building and loan associa
tion on the property. Before he went
from California he had paid all except
$4000 to $5000. Goggin lived too fast and
has met trouble of several kinds.
YOUTHS' DIRECT BY FAIR.
Big Crowds Visit the First Regiment
Armory for Fan and Charity.
The fair and festival for the new Youths'
Directory fund in progress at the First
Regiment Armory was in full swing yes
terday and last evening, everything being
in shape and big crowds in attendance.
The concert in the early part of the
evening presented an excellent pro
gramme, which called out repeated en
cores.
. The booths were all equipped with at
tractive wares, and were each of them
presided over by a bevy of beautiful and
very successful salesladies. The '49 Min
ing Camp was larpeiy patronized, as was
also the booth of Princess Amosa, a young
lady with no body but boasting a very
pretty face and head. Her fortunes were
presided ovet by Miss Agnes Fitzpatrick
and Laura Fox.
The following is the programme to be
played by the Hibernla orchestra . this
evening:
March, "Iron King" (Clair) ; selection, "Bo
hemian Girl" (Balfe); waltz, "Sounds From
Erin" (Bennett); gavotte, "Moonlight" (Chris
tie); march, "King Cotton" (Sousa); waltz
"Medley" (Stern); schottische. "Chicken Bri

(Rosey).

Chinese Lottery Ticket Cases.
The first of the now famous Chinese lottery
ticket cases will be tried before Judge Morrow
next Monday. Assistant District Attorney
Schlessinger will conduct the prosecution, and
proposes to make It warm for the importers,
Yesterday he had one of the tickets translated,
and it reads as follows:
Heaven, earth, sombre, yellow,
Universal nature vast, wild;
Son moon full declining;
Aniumn ended Winter fall;
Leap plenty complete year:
Luc Lay harmonize principles;
Clouds communicate produce rain:
Dew collect change to frost ;
Gold from Lai suy. â  '
Gems from Kiv*nÂ»Kong; >
Sword named Kuy Kit;
Pearls cal.eU nlgut light;
Fruit rÂ«?al prune plum; *
Vegetable important mustard ginger;
Ocean salt river fresh;
, Scales cover hair â¢ â¢ â¢
Dr. Agon troops fire, Emperor;
Bird mandarin, man Emperor.
The contention of the defense is that the
tickets are not lottery tickets at all, but ex
tracts from a famous Chinese poem.
Death of Mrs. JL. Blair.
Mrs. Laura Blair, the old lady who on
Thursday was sent to the Receiving Hospital
from the Crystal Swimming Baths in an un
conscious condition, died in the hospital
shortly before 8 o'clock yesterday moraine
She resided at 2iJ4 Capp street. At first it
was supposed thut Mrs. .Blair had taken a dose

THE EXAMINER
WAS FOR GOLD
And It Predicted Defeat for
Any Silver- Craze
Candidate.
WHITNEY WAS ITS IDOL
Hearst Heralded Him as One
Whose Policy Would Cause
Prosperity.
TWO VIEWS ON GREAT ISSUES
Until He Saw a Chance to Boom His
Silver Mines Editor Hearst Was
for Honest Money.
The Call's exposure of the Examiner's
position on the silver question has caused
a great deal of interest throughout the
State. Many readers of the Examiner's
old editorials, reprinted in The Call, re
membered the fact that the Examiner had
long been battling for the gold standard,
or at least doing all in its power against
the free-silver movement, until young Mr.
Hearst had something whispered in bis ear
about the chance to become a Monte Cristo
No. 2 by the appreciation of his valuable
silver mines. Ever since he heard the
tempter's voice his New York Morning
Journal and hie Examiner here have been
beating their editorial tom-toms for free
silver. It comes very awkward to Mr.
Hearst now, however, to be confronted
with the ghost of his past utterances.
The most famous acrobatic feat per
formed by the Examiner is seen in the
contrast of its advocacy of 25 to 1 with its
present utterances, exhibited in the follow
ing deadly parallel:
FAVORS 25 TO 1. BELIEVES IN 16 TO 1.
Examiner, May 4, Examiner, September
1895 â The ratio at|l3, 1896â Under free
wbich we could safely coinage the silver dol
coin silver under an in- lar will be worth ex
ter national agreement acUy the same as the
is not the same under gold dollar, and the
which we could do it parity between silver
alone. With the assist- Â«nd gold coined or un
ance of the principal oined will be 16 to 1
commercial nations we throughout the world,
could open our mines
in security at 15% to 1.
To maintain the parity
alone it might be nec
essary to make the pro
portion 25 to 1. Our
â¢xperience has not en
couraged us to believe
we could do this alone
ai 16 to 1.
The 25 to 1 idea was set forth more than
a year ago, but there have been more re
cent utterances in point. The following
From the issue of February 22, 1896. con
trasted with a late utterance speaks for
itself:
OPPOSES FANATICISM. IRADICAL FREE SILVER.

WILD
With Eczema
I m a sufferer for eight years from Eczema, but
now am entirely cared. The palms of my hands
were covered and badly Inflamed; little white
blisters appeared, then would peel off, leaving
a red, smooth surface, which would burn like
fire and l itch. On the Inside of the upper part of
my limbs, great red blotches would appear, and
as soon as I became warm, the burning and itch-
ing would begin. Night after night I would lie
awake and scratch, and almost go wild. I got a
box of Cuticura. and a bottle of Cutictjiu Re-
solvent, and after a few applications I noticed
the redness and inflammation disappear; before I
had uÂ»f.d one box there toas not a nan of Eczema
Uft. I can truthfully assert that $2.00 worth of
Cuticoua Remedies cured roe.

tacked with prospects
of success. If half of
them should be de
feated the next House
and President might
find some financial
plan upon which all
could agree.
In its issue of June 20, 1896, the Ex
aminer looked upon the silver issue as
hopeless, saying:
The silver defection from the Republican
party is simply that and nothing more, as the
case stands at present. Should the silver men,
however, succeed in the herculean task of
convincing the Democrats and Populists that
the cunency is the sole issue betore the coun
try, and that any great National party can
with a single issue represent ana harmonize
the diverse beliefs held by free-silver advo
cates on other issues, it is conceivable that
Teller will be able to lend the silver sentiment
outside as well as Inside the Remiuliean ranks.
There ia no present indication that such a
situation can be brought about.
On April 16 the Examiner showed its
animosity to the silver movement by des
ignating silver men as a "sectional
clique." Here is the contrast with its
present opinions:
A NARROW ISSXTK. A SAVING CAUSE.
Examiner, April 16, Examiner, September

would be felt to come
from a knowledge of
the needs of the whole
Nation, and not from
tbe pressure of a sec
tional clique.
Strangely, after recommending Whit
ney's policfcr as "one that could be felt to
MRS. BALLINGTON BOOTH.
I come from a knowledge of the needs of
the whole Nation," the Examiner said on
June 17, 1896:
| Another interesting circumstance is the
[ movement to send William C. Whitney to
Chicago in the interest of the gold-standard j
faction. A clo?e intimncy formerly n
between Cleveland and Whitney, and although
there has been some talk to the effect that it j
had become strained the concurrence of the !
President's letter with the Whitney move
ment is significant.
Here is the way the Examiner favored
bonds and pro Dosed to settle the money
question in its issue of January 27, 1895:
Provision for an issue of securities bearing a
low rate of interest would put the Treasury
Department in 'much better condition to meet
emergencies, and the power should be given
to the Secretary of the Treasury to raise money !
by this device whenever necessary. With I
such a law and the imposition of enough addl- !
tional taxes to give the Government the rev
enue it needs for support the financial prob- '
lem would be solved.
On May 14, 1895, the same acrobatic
paper again paid its compliments to the
silver men as follows:
According to the present disputants the
issue is between the single gold standard and
the free and unlimited coinage of silver at 16
to 1 without international agreement â in
other words, between gold monometallism and '
silver monometallism. But the majority of )
the American people are bimetallists.
A thorough study of the files of the I
paper shows that it always occupied about j
tne present position of the Republican j
party until Mr. Hearst's silver mine inter- i
ests overshadowed the paper's desire to j
tell the truth and treat the subject in
genuously. , 'â 
THOSE NEW INSPECTORS.

From Experienced Bodies Con
cerning; Them.
The Board of Health has addressed the
following note to the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association of this City:
The Board of Health of San Francisco is now I

venience some Derson who can discharge the
duties of that office fitly.
Am politics, so-called, has nothing to do with
pure foods, you will kindly consider, as we

inspector.
The note is signed by all the members
of the board. A birnlar note was ad

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1896.
THEY WILL WORK
IN THE PRISONS
Commandant of the Ameri
can Volunteers Comes
to Inspect.
SHE LIEES THE OUTLOOK
Mrs. Ballington Booth Will Be
gin Western Work at San
Quentin
AND END IT AT FOLSOM.
Predicts a Great Future for the New
Blue Uniformed Organiza
tion.
A sweet-faced swee-tveiced little woman
arrived in the City yesterday to inspect
the work and the organization of the Vol
unteers of America. By right of being
the wife of Baliinpton Booth she is the
commandant of that organization.
She paid a brief visit to the headquar-
ters on Sutter street and consulted with
Major Blackhurst, the ranking officer on
this coast, but for the most part she re
maine.i at her hotel, the Occidental, rest
ing. She is accompanied by her secre
tary. Captain Macomber.
"I ?hall begin my public work here on
Tuesday nipht next, Dy an address at
Metropolitan Temple," said Mrs. Booth.
"I shall undertake to explain the objects
and methods of the Volunteers.
"No, I shall not refer to the rupture in
the Salvation Army. Ido not come here
to create any disturbance in the ranks of
that organza ion. If I had desired any
thing of the kind I should have been here
long ago. We have our own work to do
anil we are simply going steadily along
at ending to it. I shall visit all the larger
towns in the State. 1 shall begin my
woric in the State with a meeting at San
Quentin and close it with another at Fol
sotn. My last meeting in New York was
at Sing Sing. When with the Salvation
Army I gave much attention to prison
work and the Volunteers will make a
specialty of it. I have an average of 160
letters a week from prisoners and ex
convicts. We have already mad- 100 con
versions of prisoners in New York. We
have established a borne lor them in New
York, called Hope Hall.
"The Volunteers is a new organization,"
continued Mrs. Booth. "It has made won
derful strides in that time, but we prefer
to grow slowly and surely, to build upon
a sound foundation. It has ereat possi
bilities, and I see for it a splendid future.
The formation of the Volunteers is upon
the same system as the army of the
United States. The battalion headquar
ters are called 'posts,' the battalions are
formed into regiments, and the regiments
as the movement giows will te formed
into divisions. The officers are also
designated by ranks similar to the reeular
army, and the uniform, as you know, is
the army blue.
"I am very much pleased with the prog
ress of the movement on this coast. It
seems to have the confidence and support
of the people everywhere. No less than
eleven posts have been organized, all of
them flourishine. The headquarters here
is all that could be desired, as to location
and the fai ilities it off< rs for the work.
'The Volunteers' has become a fixea and
growing and influential organization in
the East, despite the hot summer and the
hard times, and I expect to see it become
the same in every part of the country."
THE GIRLS' UNION.
Proceedings of the Annual Meeting

Opening.
League of the Cross, Wh< elmen an :
Native Sons and Daughters Do
the Bus n^ss.
All previous records of attendance for
this season at tbe Mechanics' Institute
Fair were broken yesterday and last even
ing. It was the banner night.
Over 10,000 people, friends of the League
of the Cross Cadets, League of American
Wheelmen, Native Sons and Daughters,
thronged the Pavilion. Several special
vocal and instrumental musical selections
were- rendered by the societies. Tne fair
band had a special programme prepared in
honor of the event.
Shortly after 8 o'clock the League of the
Cross Cadets, bedecked in bright uniform
and the usual military accouterments,
entered the Pavilion, headed by a fife and
drum corps. A few fancy movements
were gone through on the main floor of
the Pavilion. Then they marched down
the center aisle and upstairs to the art
gallery, where a special musical and liter
ary programme took place. Miss K. L.
Galvin gave a piano solo and Professor S.
J. Sandy, the well-known basso, sang. An
address was delivered by Colonel W. P.
Buiuvan Jr., during wbich he took occa
sion to eulogize the great movement in be
half of temperance and the necessity of
supporting home industry in order to at
tain commercial prosperity. Roberto
Stantlni gave a tenor solo and Miss
Clotilda Devlin rendered a difficult move
ment on the violin, the accompanist on
the piano being Miss Grace Deviin.
At 9:30 o'clock the choir ol the League
of the Cross Cadets rendered a grand
chorus. The affair was under the ar
rangement of the following committee:
Colonel W; P. Sullivan Jr., Lieutenant-
Colonel Thomas F Ryan, Major Daniel C.
Deasy, Captain James Powers, Lieutenant
N. A. Denvir, A. B. Maguire, Charles B.
Finn, J. C. Murphy.
Several hundred of the wheelmen and
their young ladies wore the regulation
bicycle costume. They had no set pro
gramme, but everybody did everything in
their power to make everybody else
happy. Three grand prizes were offered
for the club having tde largest number
present in unform, the best uniformed
gentleman rider, the best uniformed lady
rider. The Barker Club won the club
prize and C. J. Sparrow was awarded the
medal for being the best costumed wneel
man.
The Native Sons and Daughters were
present in large numbers. El Dorado,
Hesperian and Orinda parlors turned out
in full force. Ihe bears and badges
seemed about in the Pa-ilion in great pro
fusion. The pupils of the Franklin Gram
mar School sang the "Star-Spangled Ban
ner 1 and other patriotic songs under the
leadership of Miss Jane Seymour Klink.

NEW POLICE STATION.
One Will Soon Be Erected In the Vicin
ity of Devisiidcro and O'Farrell
If the recommendation of the Health
and Police Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors is accepted by the full hoard a
new police station, to cost about $5000, will
soon be erected in the vicinity of O'Farrell
and Devisadero streets.
Chief Crowley's petition for a station
was favorably considered by the commit
tee, and he was invited to submit plans to
come within the figure named.
The committee also favored Sheriff Whe
lan's petition for a new van for County
Jail No. I, and decided to immediately ex
pend $500 in putting up quarters for those
awaiting examination on charges of in
sanity. ' Â£^' r â :
HE DECEIVED A WIDOW.
R. Snowden Arrested for Embez
zling Mrs. S. B. Williams'
Property.
The Romance of a Sad y Duped Woman
to Ba Aired in the Police
Court
Another interesting romance was
knocked in the bead last nig t by tbe po
lice, and a choice bit of gossip will be
aired in the courts within the next few
days, when the case of Robert Bnowden,
charged with embezzlement, comes up for
bearing. Snowden was arrested last even
ing on Mason and Market streets by De
tectives Beymour and Whitaker, and
lock dup in the City Prison. He is a
prepossessing appearing fellow, about 28
years of age. He claims to be a news
paper man, piano-player, etc. His vic
tim, who swore to the warrant, is Mrs.
Sarah B. Williams, a widow over 40 years
of age.
The story of the difficulty as told by the
complaining witness illustrates how
easily a person, even when well advanced
in age, may be deceived. According to
her story she met young Snowden in
Denver, their acquaintance having been
brought about through a newspaper per
sonal. Snowden claimed to be the son of
"General" Snowden of California, and
said that he was well to do. He asked
Mrs. Williams to go with him or meet
him in the Golden State, and she
promised to do so. Snowden left Denver
and came to California, and later Mrs.
Williams started for this State and her
promised husband tret her in Sacramento.
When she arrived here on August 10 she
went to tbe Palace Hotel, where she has
been until recently.
According to her story Snowden induced
her to part with money and jewelry
amounting to $1500, and he delayed lead
ing her to the altar on the plea that his
father, the "general," was ill. When the
"general" recovered he said he would have
plenty of money. At last the hotel people
decided that it was time for Mrs. Wil
liams to pay her little bill of $90, and, as
she was without funds, her trunks, etc.,
were retained, and Mrs. Williams was
obliged to seek other quarters, which she
found in a charitable institution in the
Mission. By this time the woman was
convinced that she had been sadly duped,
and she swore out a warrant for her de
ceiver's arrest.
Snowden does not care to discuss the
difficulty he is in, but says it will all come
out right.
Singer Acquitted.
Charles E. Singer, the streetcar conductor
charged with an assault with a deadly weapon
in having Btruck David Keating with a bell
punch, was yesterday acquitted by a Jury in
Judge Wallace's court.
WORKMEN FOR WORDEN.
The Labor Council Will Essay
to Save Him From a
Felon's Death.
Details of an Extortion Said to Have
Been Put Upon the Crew of
the J D Peters.
S. D. Worden, though convicted of
murder and now lying in durance under
sentence of death, is not without friends.
I At its meeting last night the Labor Coun
cil decided to print and circulate 2500
copies of a petition prepared by the con
demned man's brother asking the
Governor to commute Worden's sentence
to imprisonment for life.
Delegate McArthur made a long ad
dress in support of the petition. He said
the salient feature in the Worden case was
a desire in certain quarters to vindicate
the claim that the authorities have the
rigbt to harass all who may be prominent
in the rants of organized labor. Wor
den's death would, he contended, set the
seal of Governmental approval upon all
future proceedings against the marshaled
ranks of the working people.
The petition will be sent to oil the labor
organizations in the State.
Delegate Furuaeth, representing the
Sailors' Union, reported that the owners
of the bark J. D. Feters had shipped a
crew in Port Townsend and paid $25 out
of each man's wages to an individual
named Maxey. In addition to this, he
said, tbe captain of the vessel had cnarged
the men 25 cents apiece for clay pipes, $1
a bar for ordinary soap and for other
necessaries in like proportion.
In the Divorc* Court*.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted a divorce
to Annie Rossback from Charles H. Rossback
on the ground of willful neglect
Charles H. Hartman was granted a divorce
from Helen Hartman because of the latter's
extreme cruelty. Judge Sanderson made the
decree.
