Here Are Figures to Show McKln-

CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 4 â The following
signed statement was issued from Repub
lican National headquarters to-night:
"Considering the wild rumors which are
being circulated throughout the country
we deem it proper and advisable to state
the result of the election as indicated by
the returns and continued by telegrams to
this office from the chairmen of ; the sev
eral State committees and members of the
National committee in "the several States.
McKinley has carried beyond a doubt a
sufficient number of States so that his vote
in the electoral college _ will not be le-s
than 264. These States are the following
with the electoral vote of each' Stat e:
California 8 New York 36

'In addition to these the States of Ken
tucky, North Carolina' and Wyoming are
" in doubt, with; the chanc s 1 about even in
the three States,' although the Republicans
. in Kentucky claim v that the State will
4 give its electoral vote to McKinley by a
I majority of not less than 3000.
"It is proper to give the basis of the
I claims in the disputed : States. Advices
late this evening from California, from a
member of the National Committee in
San Francisco, place the majority in r that
State at 8000. This is confirmed by press
reports. Telegrams from Indiana, from
the chairman of the State Republican ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
/ Central Committee and the member of tbe
I National Committee, show that the State
has given not less than 25,000, and prob
ably over 30,000 for McKinley, and that
the Republicans have elected all the meni
| bers of Congress, and carried tbe Le*is-
I lature by a majority ot 40 on joint ballot.
"Telegrams from North and South Da-
I kota which have been contirmea by the
I press reports received place the majority
â  in these States at a little more than 5000
in North Dakota and about 3500 in South
Dakota. In North Dakota we have elected
the entire State ticket and carried the
Legislature. In South Dakota the Legis
lature is in doubt There is no possible
foundation for the report being circulated
that Mr. Bryan has carried many of the
States placed in the sure column for Mc-
Kinley. Henry G. Payne."
A late telegram from Chairman Gowdy
of toe Indiana Republican Committee
stated: "Conservative estimates give Me-
Kiuley 20,000 majority in Indiana. Ten
Congressmen sure; hope for eleven, with
both branches of the Legislature Repub
lican."
A telegram to headquarters stated
that chances in Wyoming were about
even. Two remote counties were unheard
from; also large precincts in other coun
ties. From all precincts heard from so
far there is a small majority for McKin
ley.
HAS A SAFE MAJORITY.
The "Sun" Says There Is No Doubt
About McKinley's Election.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 4.â The Sun
will say ro-morrow that later returns do
not greatly alter* its figures heretofore
given. McKinley is elected by a large
plurality in the electoral college, havinc
287 votes. There are several close States,
most of which the Sun gives to Bryan, but
it adds that if all the close States are given
to Bryan, McKinley will still have a safe
margin. The new House of Representa
tives will stand 232 Republicans, 105 Demo
crats, 3 cold Democrats and 17 Populists.
New York State's plurality for McKinley
is 271,662. _
CARRIES KENTUCKY.
McKinley Has at Least One Thou
sand Majority There.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 4.â The fol
lowing bulletin was issued by Chairman
Roberts to-night at 11 o'clock:
The Republican State Committee
claims Kentucky by 1000 majority. It
wired its county chairmen to-day for com
plete corrected footings by counties and
received returns from all but five counties
in the mountain section. The*e unofficial
returns were classified by districts with
tbia result:
The Democrats will go to the Eleventh
District, the Republican Gibraltar, with
13.600 majority in their favor. This-dis
trict gave Governor Bradley a little over
12,000 majority last year and has been
counted on all along for 15,000 this year.
Returns from over naif the counties of
the district already assures considerably
over 14,000 Republican majority, upon
which basis the committee is justified in
claiming the State by approximately
1000 majority.
Tbe official count will be made Thurs
day and Friday. The sudden transfer of
Kentucky from the sure McKiniey to the
doubtful column early this morning was
caused by a simultaneous report from a
tier of counties in the west end of the
State, where the Populists and free silver
Democrats have full sway, which gave
surprisingly large Democratic majorities.
One of these countie , Graves, from which
no satisfactory report could be secured last
night, came to band late this afternoon
with 305G majority for Bryan, a majority
486 greater than the total combined vote of
tbe Democrats and the Popuiists last year.
All tbe important Democratic gains were
made in the four Congressional districts
south and west of Louisville, where nine
tenths of the people of Kentucky are cen
tered.
The fusion of Populists with Silver Dem

ocrats was perfect and the latter captured
the entire four Congressional seats in ex
change for two places on the electoral
ticket.
Among the Republicans who went
down in the Populist wreck were Con
gressman Hunter, who manaee I las
year's campaign for Governor Bradley,
and Congressman Lewis, two of the ablest
campaigners in Kentucky politics. In
Louisville and Lexington and in the Fifth,
Se-entb, Eighth and Eleventh districts
the Republicans made brilliant gains, but
they were almost wiped out by the Dem
ocratic-Populist fusion in Western Ken
tucky. Sam J. Roberts, Chairman.

Major McKinley bad a good rest this
afternoon and spent the early part of the
evening in his library, surrounded by a
A COLD DAY FOR THE WILLIE BOYS.
group of friends and newspaper men. He
was visited by three delegations to-day.
They came from Minerva, Carrollton
and Cleveland in this State. The Cleve
land delegation included the neatly uni
formed Republican club of tbe Thirty
ninth Ward. Major McKinley made no
speeches, but appeared for a short time on
the porch and bowed to his visitors.
There were a great many callers in
small groups, who came into the house
and congratulated Mr. McKinley.
Major McKinley has received all of his
news to-day from the bulletins of the
United Associated Presses, save some dis
patched which came over his private wire.
The election news service of the United
Assoc ated Presses has been highly appre
ciated by Major McKinley and h.s Canton
friends, who assert that lor accuracy and
comprehensiveness it has not been
equaled.
Canton was thrown into a state of
gloomy excitement this afternoon by the
publication of a bulletin issued by the
Chicago Associated Press, stating that
only 220 electoral votes were certain for
McKinley.
There was a feeling of panic for a time
and Major McKinley's telephone was kept
busy answering the questions of anxious
inquirers. This same bulletin was printed
in many of the smaller Ohio cities and
has caused no end of annoyance.
Telegrams ot congratulation are still
pouring in. Thomas B. Reed telegraphed
to Major McKinley from San Francisco:
"Coneratulations on the success of the
Union. California also seern-j safe."
Mayor Strong of New York wired : "The
citizens of New York would be delighted
to give you a reception in the Governor's
room in tne City Hall at as early a day as
possible, and 1 offer you and your cood
wile the hospitality of my home during
your stay in this city."
Other telegrams were receiyed.
IN DISPUTED STATES.
Messages of All Kinds That Do Not
Change the Result.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 4.â Telegrams re
ceived this afternoon by acting Chairman
Payne of the Republican National Com
mittee from the disputed States gave the
committee assurance to claim 277 electoral
votes sure for McKinley. The estimates
dent by State chairmen were as follows:
South Dakota 3500, Kentucky 5000, West
Virginia 14,000, Oregon 3500, California
6000 to 9000. Mr. Payne characterized as
buncombe the claim of Indiana Democrats
that the State had given 5000 majority for
Bryan. Mr. Payne admitted the Repub
licans would lose a Senator in Washing
ton.
At the Democratic National headquar
ters the messages received from State
chairmen and others during the afternoon
were more encouraging than at any time
since tbe returns bs^an to come in. A
dispatch from ParkersburÃ, W. Va., read :
"I have no fear about West Virginia."
State Chairman Martin of Indiana wired
that returns from tbe rural districts of
that State showed large net Democratic
gains over 1892.
The North Dakota chairman sent word
thai the State had probably gone for
Bryan by 2000.
National Committeeman Powers of
Utah telegraphed that the Democratic
majority in Utah had increased to 40,000.
Word came from the Pacific Coast that
1553 precincts in California, including San
Francisco, cave McKinley 111,288 and
Bryan 107,829.
"Our people say Kentucky is all right,"
was the answer of Chairman Jones to re
peated inquiries as to the foundation of
the Republican claim that the State had
gone for McKinley.
The "Independent Gold Standard De
mocracy," the official title of the Palmer
and Buckner party in this State, ha 3 failed
to poll its 2 per cent of the total vote in
Illinois. In consequence it falls below the
limit fixed by law and can never under
I its present organization take part in any
State or municipal elections. This was
one of the main objects of the leaders in
this city and Stale in making such an
aggressive fight and putting up local, Con
gressional and State tickets. It is believed
in political circles that the gold Demo
crats will fuse with Republicans in future
elections.
Colonel Perry S. Heath of the Republi
can National headquarters staff, com
menting on the result of the legislative
elections in the States where new Sena
tors would probably be Republicans, said
to a reporter for the United Associated
Presses :
'â¢We will have a sound-money majority
in the lower house of Congress beyond
cavil or doubt, to support McKinley.
There will be a good, clean majority of
sound-money Senators, including sound
money Democrats, who will support the
Republicans iv slopping any rial money
money or similar legislation. There will
only be a few silver Republican Senators
who will bo against the administration on
tariff legislation. We will also have a ma
jority for a McKinley tariff bill, although
it may be probable that we will not have
a Republican sound-money majority in
the Senate. There will probably be no at
tempt to re-enact tha McKinley tariff of
1890. I doubt if such silver Senators as
Pettigrew, Teller and Dubois would vote
against the Republican party on a tariff
measure.. Senator Wiison of' Washington
told me when here recently lhat the Re
publicans might lose the State for gold,
but would elect enough protection and sil
ver members of the Legislature to guar
antee a successor to Senator Squire who
would be a McKinley tariff supporter, ai-.
though for silver."
"FRAUD" IS THE CRY.
Disgruntled DamocratsSay Returns
Are Being Held Back.
CHICAGO. 111., Nov. 4.â Anxiety and
determination and a hostile feeling toward
their political opponents pervaded the
campaign headquarters of the Democratic
party all day, and especially to-night
when tbe rank and file in Chicago were
aroused to make a street demonstration.
Chnirman Jones, his fellow-members of
the National committee, and every sub
ordinate remaining on duty at the Audi
torium annex, not only cried fraud all day,
but toward evening when fuller returns
from the Western States were waited for
in vain they united in seriously claiming
the election of William J. Bryan. In the
absence of official news from county chair
men Senator Jones had to rely on infor
mation from private sources.
To-night he claimed as certain for
Bryan 210 electoral votes, and said only
one State â Michigan or Indiana â was
needed to make tne silver Democracy tri
umphant. The Republican claim of 40,
-000 majority in Indiana had been reduced
by Executive Committeeman Dnrbin to
30,000, and the Democratic claim was that
Indiana would show a majority of 5000
for Bryan. On the Michigan question
Secretary Alward ot the Republican State
Committee wired that McKinley's ma
jority would reach 50,000 and ten out of
twelve Republican Congressmen were
elected, Linton and Mimes being de
feated.
Against tbi3 claim Chairman Campau
of tbe Democratic National Commute c
made this assertion: "Gross frauds have
been perpetrated in the upper peninsula
of Michigan. Take Houghton County tÂ»s
an example. It gave 715 majority for
Harrison. The Republicans claim a ma
jority there of 4100. It is absurd. With a
fair count we will show Michigan has
gone for Bryan by a small majority.
"The returns are being held back for
some reason, and it seems to be for pur
poses of manipulation. We suspect an
attempt to repeat the crime of 1876, but
we are on guard now and the people will
not allow it to be perpetrated."
Senator Jone3 considered the situation
serious enough from a Democratic point
of view to call for the immediate attend
ance of absent National committeemen
with whom he bas advised during the
campaign. He sent a telegram to Gov
ernor Stone at Jefferson City, Mo., asking
him to come at once to Chicago. The
Senator was closeted with Governor Alt
geld to-night for some time. The Gov
ernor denounced the alleged manipula
| tion of returns as an outrage and said it
should be protested asainst. Chairman
| Jones said to a reporter for the United
j Associated Press:
"I claimed before the election every one
of the Southern States, which give 156
votes. I also claimed all the States west
of the Missouri River, which give 61 elec
toral votes, making a total of 217. I have
hoped that Michigan, Indiana and Min
nesota would co for Mr. Bryan. I believe
we have carried every Southern and every
Western State heretofore counted on (not
including Delaware). This makes a total
pf 209 votes. One vote we have in Dela
ware and probably all three, which leaves

FIGURES ON CONGRESS.
Smith Says There Will Be a Safe
Sound-Money Majority.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 4.â Joseph Â±Â».
Smith, who is one of Major McKinley'a
closest political friends and who has been
a member of the McKinley household
during the campaign, has been doing
some figuring on the Senate. He says
that from the best information at hand at
1 o'clock to-day it appears that the Senate
of the United States after March 4 next
will consist of 49 sound-money Republi
cans and Democrats and 41 silver Demo
crats and Republicans. This grouping
will not apply to the tariff and some
other questions and does not indicate the
number of supporters that Major McKin
iey's administration will have on these
issues. A number of sound-money Demo
crats will oppose the Republican tariff
policy, and probably three of the silver
Republicans will be in harmony with it.
HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED.
Babcock Says the Republicans Will
Rule the House.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 4.âChair
man Babcock says that he has complete
returns from 193 Congressional districtsc ts
that have elected Republicans. There are
135 districts that have elected Democrats
or Populists and 23 districts in which the
returns are incomplete. These may all
be classed as doubtful, and with the pros
pect that the Republicans will secure at
least one-half of them, which would make
a total Republican niemb.rship in the
next Congress of 207. It is safe to say, he
adds, that under no circumstances would
the membership fall belov. 200.
ARKANSAS.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark.. Nov. 4.â Returns
from yesterday's election indicate that
Bryan's majority in this State will not ex
ceed 35,000. Congressman Terry ran 300
ahead of Bryan in this, city. All tbe
Democratic candidates for Congress are
elected by increased majorities. They are
as follows: First District, P. D. McCul2
lough; Second, John S. Little; Third, T.
C. McÃao; Fourth, W. L. Terry; Fifth.
H. A. Dinsmore; Sixth, S. Brunridge Jr.
COLORADO.
DENVER, Colo., Nov. 3.â There is no
change in the figures given out last night
from Colorado, except that the election of
Governor is in doubt. It will be close, and
an official count will be necessary. It is
thought Democraisand silver Republicans
claim that their candidate is elected.
CONNECTICUT.
HARTFORD. Cox.v, Nov. 4.â Revised
returns (unofficial) from every town in the
State show that McKinley's plurality is
54,142. The Republican majority on joint
ballot in the Legislature will be 214. Cook
for Governor has a plurality of 44.340 and
a majority of 52.302 over Senator Sargent,
silver Democrat. Bryan carries only three
of IGS towns in the State.
INDIANA.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ixd., Nov. 4.â lt has
been a day of uncertainty and anxiety in
Indiana. Tiiere was in the late returns
last night and in those up to noon to-day
a steady decline in the percentage of Re
publican gains as additional precincts
were reported that led tne Democratic
State Coniruitlee and the Democratic
newspapers to claim the State. The bul
letin boards have bee;: surrounded all day
with vast crowds of j*ople making the
streets impassable. They stood in the
rain an i cheered the slightest indication
of anything favorable to their side of the
case in Indiana, but they had no patience
for returns from other State?, apparently
beir.tr convinced that it all depended upon
Indiana.
The returns to the Democratic State
Committee are very meager, but do not
differ materially lrom the Republican re
turns from the same counties. There are
ninety-two counties in the State. Com
plete returns from sixty-two of these
counties, with others estimated from very
nearly complete returns, favor McKinley
by 21,908. Returns entire cannot change
these figures more than 1000 at most.
These returns for the most part come in
the shape of pluralities by counties and
the vote cannot be given until the official
count is made to-morrow.
The Republicans have carried both
branches of the Legislature and have a
majority of thirty-two on joint ballot,
thus assuring the election of a Republican
to succeed Senator Voorhees. They have
elected nine Congressmen and the fusion
ists have elected one silver Republican
and three Democrats. The following have
been elected: James A. Hemenway R.,
W. R. Meyers D.. W. T. Zener D.. W. S.
Holman D.. George W. Fans R., Henry U.
Johnson R., Jesse Overstreet R., Charles
L. Henry R., Joseph B. Cheadle S. R., E.
D. Crurnpacker R., Geores W. Steele
R., W r F. Robinson R., W. A. Royse R.
At 10 o'clock to-night Chairman Martin
of the Democratic State Committee con
cedes the State to McKinley by 23,000, but
claimed the election of five Congressmen,
Miers in tiie Second District, Zenor in the
Third, Holman in the Fourth, Cheadle in
the Ninth and Robinson in the Twelfth.
The Republicans concede all these but
Cheadle, claiming the election of Landis
by 500.
IOWA.
DES MOINES, lowa, Nov. 4.â The re
turns from lowa are not yet complete, but
indicate that the National Republican
ticket has carried the State by not less
than 7'J,000, and possibly 80,000. plurality
over the fused Democrats and Populists-
Palmer and Buckner will receive not over
4000 votes. Tne sound-money Democratic
committee claims that from 40,000 to
50,000 Democrats voted for McKinley.
AdoiU a quarter of the fusion vote is cast
by the Populists.
The Republican State ticket, headed by
Secretory of State and including Auditor,
Treasurer, Supreme Judge, Attorney-
General nnd Railroad Commissioner, is
elected by about the same figure as the
National ticket. The fusion extended to
State and Congressional tickets.
The Republicans have elected the entire
eleven Congressmen by the following plu
ralities: First District, S. If. Clark, 4500;
Second, George M. Curtiss, 3500; Third, D.
B. Henderson, 9000; Fourth, Thomas Up
rte^raff, 8000; Fifth, R. G. Cousins, 9000;
Sixth, John F. Lacey. 200; Seventh, J. A.

TOPEKA, Kans., Nov. 4.â Bryan and
Sewall have carried Kansas by a small
plurality, but the State ticket is in doubt.
The Populists have elected Ridgley to
Congress in the Third District, Vincent in
the Fourth, McCormick in the Sixth ana
Simpson in the Seventh. They claim the
Congressman at large. The Republicans
have elected Brodenck to Congress in the
First District, Harris in the Second ana
Curtis in t.e Fourth. They also claim
the Congressman at large. The Legisla
ture is in doubt. Both the Republicans
and Populists rluim it.
MICHIGAN.
DETROIT, Mich., Nov. 4.â The late re
turns from the State continue to show
R-publican tains over the vote of 1892.
The leaders of the Republican party in the
upper peninsula claim that McKinley's
plurality in that section will reach ?0,000,
and if the official figure:, bear out their
claim the Republicans have carried the
State on the National ticket by nearly
60.000 plurality.
Mayor Pingree of Detroit R., candidate
for Governor, has carried the State by
iully 60,000, and runs more than 10,000
ahead of his ticket.
The Legislature is overwhelmingly Re
publican, although ihe fusionists have
elected twenty-two Representatives and
five Senators. Two years ago John Dono
van of Barr was the only anti-ReDublican
who was elected in either branch.
The Republicans have carried ten out of
the twelve Congressional districts. A. M.
Todd (silver Democrat) is elected in the
Third District by a small plurality and
F. A. Brucker (silver Democrat) has de
feated W. S. Linton (R.) by about 10U0
plurality.
The Republicans have elected the fol
lowing Congressmen: First District, J. B.
Corless; Second, George Spalding; Fourtn,
N. L. Hamilton; Filth, William Alden
Smkh; Sixth, S. W. Smith: Seventh,
Horace G. Snover; Ninth, Rosweli P.
Bishop; Tenth, R. O. Crump; Eleventh,
W. S. Me-ick; Twelfth, T. C. Sheldon.
The Republican pluralities for Congress
men range from 1000 for Crump to 12,000
for Sheldon.
MINNESOTA.
ST. PAUL, Minn., Nov. 4.â Returns are
sufficiently complete lor Minnesota this
evening to indicate clearly how the State
has gone. McKinley has a plurality of
perhaps a little more than 30,000, having
carried St. Paul by 4400 and Minneapolis
by 6300. Ti.e Republicans also eiect all
of their State ticket. It was thoupht for a
while this afternoon that Clough (R.) was
defeated for Governor, but returns re
ceived up to 9 p. m. show that he has
defeated Lind by a plurality of from 5000
to 10,000. All the rest of the ticket is
elected by 20,000. The Republicans also
get all of the seven Congressmen. Towne,
the silver leader, who made the race in
the Sixth District, is apparently defeated
by less than 500. In the Seventh District
Lomar (Pop.) is defeated by Eddy (R.) by
over 2500. The Legislature is overwdelm
ingly Republican, that party having car
ried at least eighty- live of the 114 districts.
NEBRASKA.
LINCOLN, Nkbb, Nov. 4.â Returns by
counties, which began coming in to-day,
merely served to emphasize what was ap
parent early this morning â that Drvan and
the entire fusion Stute ticket have carried
in Nebraska. Tho plurality will not be
sweeping, but each belated precinct
which comes in seems to make more de
cisive the victory. Republicans have not
yet ceased hoping, and Chairman Post
will not concede defeat, but it will take a
landslide in all tho remote quarters of the
State to change the tide. The Republican
defection seems to have been largest in
the cities and towns, where heretofore has
been their strength. Best estimates place
the majority for Bryan in the State at
7000. Holcomb, fusion, for Governor,
seems to be running slightly ahead of
the electoral ticket. Of the six Congres
sional districts the First is undoubtedly
Republican by a narrow margin, the Sec
ond Republican, the Fourth and Fifth in
doubt, and the Third and Fifth fusion.
Few figures have been received on the
Legislature, but prospects for the silver
Democrats and Populists controlling both
branches are the best.
NEVADA.
CARSON, Nev., Nov. 4.â Returns from
small outside precincts are coming in very
slow. All, however, give Bryan and Se
wall large majorities, and also give entire
silver Democratic State ticket majorities.
Newlands sure to be returned to Congress
and Jones to the Senate. Silver Demo
cratics will have a majority in the Legis
lature on joint ballot.
NEW JERSEY.
NEW YORK. N. V., Nov. 4.â The latest
returns from New Jersey make but little
change in the report sent out by the
United Associated Presses last nient. Mc-
Kiniey's plurality is 74,094.
NORTH CAROLINA.
RALEIGH, N, C, Nov. 4.â At Demo
cratic heauquarters Chairman Manley
said: "Returns from the State come in
slowly, but indicate Democratic gains in
every county save two so far heard from,
which, if maintained, are safe to give
Watson (D.) a clear majority for Gov
ernor. I think it safe to say he is elected.
Bryan's majority, it now seems, will be
not less than 20,000. I think Kitchen and
Doughton, Democrats, are elected to Con
gress from the Fifth and Eighth districts
respectively. Kitchen has made great
gains In the Fifth on Settle's vote in 1894
I rind that the Republican State chairman
is basing all his estimates on the State on
the vote of 1892, when we had 40,000 plu
rality."
RepuDlican State Chairman Holton said
at 11:30 o'clock; "1 have no information
as to the Fifth District, save as to Guil
ford and Stokes counties, both of which
go Republican. Settle's election is doubt
ful. Ah to other Congressmen, Pearson of
the Ninth telegraphed he is safe. I think
he is beyond doubt, f. think we elect
Linney in the Eighth. There is no
definite news as. to Fowler in the Third.
I feel sure of Skinner in the First. White
in the Second, Stroud in the Fourth, Mar
tion in the Sixth and Shuaorm in the
Seventh are elected. I have no figures on
the vote for Governor. Twenty-one coun
ties heard from give a Republican gain of
20,000 over the vote of 1592 and lose only
80. McKinley will carry the State by 25,
-000 if the ratio keopÃ up witbin 50 per
cent of my reports."
National Committeeman Josephus
Daniels at 11 o'c.ock to-night nays Bryan's
majority in the State approximates 15,000,
and he is absolutely safe; that the contest
for Governor is not yet certain, but in
dications favor the election of Russell. It
may take an official count to determine.
The Populists have elected Congressmen
in the First, Third, Fourth, S:xth and
Seventh districts, the Democrats in the
Fifth and Eighth.
Republicans in the Second certain and
in the Ninth probable, but the latter is in
doubt. Settle R. in the Fifth is defeated
by 500. The Leginlature will have 70 Re
publicans, 50 Democrats and 50 Populists.
The Democratic State chairman predicts
the election ol Doughton D. ior Congress
in the Eighth District and has strong
hopes of the election of Adams in the
Ninth.
The Republican State chairman says at
11 o'clock, upon latest electoral returns,
that it will take the official count to deter
mine between Bryan and McKinley.
MISSOURI.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 4.â Chairman
Cook of the Democratic Committee at 9:40
advanced the figure of the majority for
Bryan from 40,000 to 53,000. Nearly all
the cities are complete. The few country
precinct returns received show small gains
for the Democrats. Stephens for Gover
nor, against whom the Republicans
worked hardest, suffered some, but in
many places led his ticket. There will be
almost a reversal in the political character
of the Congressional delegation.
Latest reports indicate the election of
the following: First Distr ct, S. P. Giles;
Second, 11. N. Bodine; Third, A. M.
Dockery; Fourth, George Crowther (R.);
Fifth, W. S. Cowherd; Sixth, D. A. de
Armond; Seventh, John P. Tracy (R.);
Eighth R. Bland; Ninth, Champ Clark;
Tenth, Richard Bartholdt (R.); Eleventh,
Charles F. Joy (R.); Twelfth, C. E.
Pearce (R.); Tnirteenth, Edward Rabb;
Fourteenth, W. R. Vandiver; Fifteenth,
M. E. Henton.
But five of these, Crowther, Tracey, Bar
tholdt, Joy and Pearce, are Republicans.
The Democrats have a majority of over
thirty on joint ballot in the State Legis
lature and will elect a successor to Senator
Vest.
ILLINOIS.
CHICAGO, 111.. Nov. 4 -Returns from
the State are coming in slowly, but bear
out early estimates of a majority exceed
ing 100.0C0 for McKinley, with the vote fcr
Governor running well up. In Chicago
Tanner polled 30,000 less than the head of
the ticket, but he ran ahead in many
country districts and it is believed he will
not be far behind McKinley when the re
turns are complete. The entire Cook
County (Chicaeo) Republican ticket was
elected.
The tidal waVe assures a Republican
majority in both branches of the State
Legislature, and in consequence a Repub

candidate for the Presidency on the Gold
Democratic ticket.
The Democrats have elected three and
possibly four Congressmen. Those elected
are: Hinrichsen in the Sixteenth, Hunter
in the Tenth and Jehu Baker in tne
Twenty-first Congressional districts.
In the Seventeenth Caldwell D. claims
his election, and fa the Third, after a close
race. Belknap R. defeated Darrow D.
The Gold Democrat ticket polled less
than the 2 per cent required by law to give
it. standing as a National party, and so
has virtually passed out of existence.
Both State and National headquarters were
closed to-day.
TENNESSEE.
MEMPHIS, Term., Nov. 4.â Tennessee
is generally conceded to Bryan, bat the
gubernatorial election at this hour,
12:15 a. m., is exceedingly close between
Taylor D. and Tillman R. Each side
claims it ana the official count may be
necessary. Congressional results are cer
tain to be: First District, W. P. Brown
iOwÃ; Second, H. EL Gibson R. ; Third,
J. A. Moore D. ; Fourth, Benton McMil
lan D. ; Fifth, J. D. Richardson D. ; Sixth,
J. W. Games 1). ; Seventh, N. N. Cox D. ;
Eighth. T. W. Sims D. ; Ninth, Rice A.
Pierce D. ; Tenth, E. W. Carmack. In the
Tenth District Carmack, silver Democrat,
has a majority over J. Patterson, gold
Democrat, but the matter will be con
tested.
SOUTH DAKOTA.
PIERRE, S. Dak., Nov. 4.â The returns
from South Dakota are exasperatingly
slow and the indications are that the State
has perhaps gone less than 1000 for either
Bryan or McKinley. All the returns that
have come in to-night show Bryan gains.
Lawrence County, in the center of the
Black Hills, has just reported a majority
of 500 for Bryan. The Republicans had
been claiming that county all day. A
majority ol the counties seem to have gone
Populist and the Legislature appears at
this hour to have a Populist majority.
The incomplete returns now indicate that
both Populist Congressmen are elected
and probably the Populist State officers.
It may take' official returns to decide
Sontn Dakota.
YANKTON, S. Dak., Nov. 4.-From
present indications the Legislature will be
very close on joint ballot and may possi
bly have a small majority for the. silver
ites. Thirty-five thousand votes are yet to
be received and it may be impossible to
know the result in this State to-night
NORTH DAKOTA.
BISMARCK, N. Dak., Nov. 4.â Enough
is known to show that the State has gone
for McKinley by at least 3000. The
northern Populist counties have not come
up with the expected Populist majorities.
The Republicans have elected their State
ticket by safe majorities and Johnson R.
is re-elected to Congress by 3500. The
Legislature is Republican by 20 on joint
ballot.
OHIO.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 4.-Chairman
Kuriz of the Republican State Executive
Committee issued k bulletin to-night show
ing that 86 out of 88 counties of the State
give Republican gains over the Republican
plurality of last year of 12,450 and Demo
cratic gains of 50,632. This is a net Demo
cratic gain of 38.187 over the vote of last
year, and shows a Republican plurality in
the State of 54,440. Estimating tue result
in the ether two counties, Morrow and
Stark, at 1500 piuraluy the Republicans'
electoral ticket in Ohio is 52,940.
NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 4.â Corrected
returns from all counties in New York State
give McKinley a plurality ot 266,073. Only
one county, Schoharie, was carried by
Bryan.
Careful revision of the returns for As
semblymen in the 150 districts in this
State make little change in tne list sent
out by the United Associated Presses las',
night. The totals stand: 114 Republicans
and 36 Democrats.

enty-six election precincts out of 295, Mc-
Kinley pets 4178, Bryan 4317. a D?mo
cratic gain 614. Congressional and judi
cial tickets are keeping pace with the
electoral vote. No returns are in from
Johnson or Crook counties, but both have
Democratic indications. The entire Demo
cratic electoral. Congressional and 6tate
ticket will have a plurality of about 5000.
Both parties now claim the electoral and
Congressional votes of Wyoming. The
Republican State Committee has returns
from eleven of thirteen counties, and
these, with estimates of the two remain
ing, indicate the election of Republican
electors and Congressmen by pluralities
of about 200. The Democratic State Com
mittee has returns from eleven counties
showing a Democratic majority of 504.
A conservative view of the situation is
that the State will be carried by less than
300 plurality, and complete returns from
every county in the State will be necessary
to determine which party will have this
plurality. The State Legislature will be
40 Repuolicans, 16 Democrats on joint
ballot.
DELAWARE.
WILMINGTON, Del., Nov. 4.-The
outloook to-night is that the McKinloy
electors will have a plurality of over
2000. Some rural districts are still miss

Democrats will have a majority on joint
ballot in the Legislature, which is to elect
a Senator.
Tunnell D. for Governor and Handy
(free silver D.) for Congress are elected.
OKLAHOMA.
GUTHJtIE, O. T., Nov. 4. -Returns

1000 majority. Both branches of the Legis-
Jature will oe controlled by the Democrats
and a majority of the counties in tne Ter
ritory elected free-silver tickets.
WEST VIRGINIA.
CHARLESTON, W. Va.. Nov. 4.-Re

MAJOR M'KINLEY'S
SWEEPING VICTORY
Continued from First Page.
OS fourteen votes to get to elect Mr. Bryan.
i-iher Michigan or Indiana will give us
these votes. Reports from ench of these
States show that we have probably carried
Indiana and have the best chance to win
both. We cannot tell yet whether we will
win either.
"We are perfectly justified in claiming
the election of Mr. Bryan, and I believe
the temper of the people is such that they
will not submit to being beaten by tricks
and fraud. The statements made in the
papers that I have given up tne fight and
conceded McKinley's election show a de
liberate attempt to create a false public
sentiment; to make the people believe
McKinley's election is accomplished and
acquiesced in. I have not for a moment
acquiesced in his election and will not
until material returns change the present
situation. On the present showing I
claim Mr. Bryan's election, as I believe
Indiana and rrobab'y Michigan have
been carried for Bryan, and if either has
Mr. Bryan is elected."
THEY DID NOT PARADE.
Sllverltes Cause Chlcajro Police
Force to Be Called Out.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 4.â Reports cir-~
culated shortly after 6 o'clock to-night
that Bryan had been elected caused con
siderable excitement in Chicago and at
many places Jarge crowds gathered. At
the Auditorium three or four hundred
people assembled early and preparations
were made to parade the downtown
streets. A verbal permit was given the
silver men to march by Chief of Police
Badenoch, before he went home to dinner
and on this the parade was organized.
Just about the time t c start was to have
been made some one telephoned a mes
sace to the Central police station, the
purport of which cannot be learned from
the sergeant who received it, nor is the
sender's name known. In about an hour
Chief of Police Badenoch came in hastily
and In a short time Mayor Swift came to
the City Hall in response to a telephone
message.
It developed later that the Chief had
called out the entire polic? force of the
city and a few minutes after hi 3 arrival
at the City Hall he dispatched three
wagon-loads ol detectives to the Audi
torium. Here the men were placed out
side the doors of the big hotel and its
annex to prevent any trouble that might
arise. Two or three hundred men were
held in readiness at the Central station
to answer any calls that might be made,
but their services were siot required. On
orders two officer* tore down some posters
in front of the office of the Dispatch, the
free silver afternoon paper, and remained
on duty there until a large crowd whit:h
had been gathered there for some time
dispersed. The police refuse to say who
sent in the request for extra officers.
MAY COST ONE VOTE.
The Same Name on Different
Tickets Causes Confusion.
WILMINGTON. Del., Nov. 4.â James
G. Shaw, one of the McKinley candidates
for elector, was on both the Republican
and Union Republican tickets. On the
Union Republican ticket in Newcastle
County "Sr. " was added to his name.
Many of the election officers gave James
G. Shaw the votes, keeping tally only on
the head of the Republican ticket. Others
kept a tally for both names and so made
returns. To what extent this has been
done cannot develop until the official
count on Thursday. Then much will de
pend on the action of the board of can
vass. If the intent of the voters is to be
taken, Snasv will be the entire vote,
but if an attempt is made to show that
two men were really voted for it may re
sult in losing one vote for MeKinley.
SMALL STREET RIOT.
Bryan Soreheads Are Qulok to
Show Their Teeth.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Nov. 4.â A small
election riot occurred this afternoon in
front of the Democratic headquarters on
Niuth street. A large crowd of Bryan
supporters were receiving bulletins wnen
a crowd of several hundred Republicans,
headed by a university glee club, at
tempted to force a way through the crowd.
Fisticuffs were indulged in, tne windows
of the headquarters building smashed,
but there were no fatal or serious injuries.
The riot was soon quelled for sheer lack of
space in which to fight.
There is much excitement in this city
on account of its being Bryan's home, nnd
he das many warm friends here who are
willing to resent any slight cast on him.
VICTORY OF THE PEOPLE.
Newspapers Rejoice In the Over
throw of Anarchism.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 4.â The Tribune
in a leader this morning sums up the sit
uation as follows: The East, as was ex
pected, went solidly for McKinley. The
Middle West has repudiated Altgeldism
and the silver heresy, and presents a solid
front to the enemy. Illinois' magnificent
majority is nearly equaled by lowa and
Wisconsin, while Minnesota and Indiana
have done nobly. Kentucky and Mary
land art) undoubtedly Ret Ã¼blican. West
Virginia seems to be safe for KcKinley,
and Tennessee is claimed for the Republi
can ticket. Delaware is Republican, and
the Republican fusioi ticket in Texas
may have worked the greatest wonder of
all, and taken the Lone Star State from
the Democratic column. This would give
McKinley at least ten more votes. It is
doubtful how the other five would vot<Â».
Bryan's own State, Forth and South Da
kota are probably Republican. Missouii
has been true to its traditions and cast a
plurality of its votes for Bryan. Kansas is
claimed by the Republicans, but the re
turns are slower in coming in. Tha
Rocky Mountain States go for silver of
course. California is close, with the
chances favoring McKinley. Oregon is
true to Republicanism.
Owi:m to the unusually large number
of doubtful States it is impossible to give
the result with entire exactness at this
hour. But it is sufficient to know that
even should Bryan carry every State con
cerning which there is now any doubt he
would yet be tar short of a majority of the
electoral vote. McKinley'a election is be
yond the danger point.
The Tribune this morning comments
editorially upon the result of the election
as follows: William McKinley has been
elected by an overwhelming majority and
the anxiety of all patriotic hearts gives
place to a joy too profound for expression.
It is not oniy a victory, but one so com
plete and decisive as to answer the fervent
prayers of loyal men. Bryan, Bryanism,
Aitneldism, the free-silver conspiracy and
the deep plots of anarchists are all bulled
under an avalanche of ballots. There
have been few grander mornent3 j n Q
history of sslf-government than this. To
day the whole Nation rises by the reading
on its own mistakes and its own most
dangerous tendencies and joins none
more heartily than many who contributed
to the error.
The people will not fail to honor first of
all William McKinley himself, whose
statesmanship and lofty patriotism have
been not more conspicuous than his wise
leadership. But above all it is the victory
of tho people, who have once more shown,
with startling distinctness, their capacity
and, therefore, their right to govern them
selves. Â»
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 4.â The Times
says: We had three years of silver panic
and business depression. We have given
three months to Bryan. Capital has been
frightened, enterprise benumbed, indus
try paralyzed. Now that we have utterly
annihilated Bryan and 16 to 1, let every
body pluck up courage and get to work.
A season of prosperity richer than any in
the country's history lies before us. It
should be entered upon with zeal and
confidence, but in the sober, industrious
spirit of sensible, people. It is no time
for crazy booms or speculative kite-flying.
It is a time for hard work and business
skill and judgment and for push and en
terprise in all legitimate fields. The
American people are tired of hard times.
They want good times. It will Â«o ill with
anybody who stands in the way of their
enjoying them.
The Sun says: The full dimensions of
the victory won yesterday by the Ameri
can people cannot be measured exactly at
the present time of writing; that it is as
tremendous, as sweeping and as conclusive
as the occasion demands is manifest. The
country has repudiated the repudiators;
has warned the promoters of revolution to
keep their hands off our institutions
and has voted to maintain untarnished
the Nation's honor by one of the most
impressive demonstrations of honest and
patriotic sentiment ever witnessed in our
history. It is no man's victory. It is no
party's victory. Under divine providence
it is the American people's triumphant
assertion of eternal principles of right and
truth.
LONDON. Eng., Nov. 4.â The Star in an
article under the caption "The United
States Repudiates Currency Juggling"
says: It is crditable to the American de
mocracy thmt they fastened upon the para
mount issue, disregarding all others.
The St. James Gazette says: Behind the
silver movement ti;ere was undoubted!}' a
feeling of popular discontent with the
established order of things which is likely
to become more desperate through defeat.
Indeed it looks more like the beginning
of a great social and economic struggle
than the end.
The Pall Mall Gazette says: The decis
ion-Cf the American electors will be uni
versally accepted as most creditable, and
implies t ; iat the democracy when con
fronted with vital issues will rally in
reality and repudiate shams.
The Gazette takes occasion to laud
President Cleveland's patriotism.
The Globe says: From an outside
standpoint the most satisfactory thing is
the crushing blow which the result strikes
the cause of confiscation the world over.
The Westminster Gazette, in a leader
headed "The Great Career of a Civilized
People," says: Whatever its grievance it
will not accept repudiation.
As a matter of policy the Gazette ad
vises McKinley to leave the tariff alone.
TRADE ALREADY REVIVES.
rv'cKlnley's Election Causes Ac-
tivlty In England.
LONDON, Exg., Not. s.â Liverpool
commercial and .shipping circles are well
satisfied with the result of the election in
America.
When the extent of the majority re
ceived by McKinley was made known on
the Stock Exchange this iorenoon the
speculators became preatly excited. Tne^
exchange was crowded at an early nour
and the bidding at the opening was very
active, resulting in advances in prices of
from one to i-ix points, Chicago, Milwau
kee and St. Paul and Louisville and Nash
ville leading in the rise.
In Glasgow mercantile circles it is be
lieved the result of the election will stimu
late exports to the United States, and
there is a desire to rush export trade as
much as possible before McKinley takes
his seat, the general expectation being
that a high tar.ff of at least 2 cents will
be imposed upon sugar.
A leading merchant of Glasgow said to
a representative of the United Associ- '
ated Presses that the speculator will not
be likely to lose anything even at the
tariff mentioned, seeing that sugar is sell
ing at 9s. a hundredweight.
Shipowners do not expect to reap any
benefit from the election, as most steam
ers are already chartered for the opening
months of 1897.
The Glasgow Exchange was strong to
day in all departments.
SHOWS TRUE HONOR.
Embassador Bayard Talks of tho
Election of McKinley.
LONDON, Enq., Nov. 4.â Embassador
Bayard in the course of a conversation
with a representative of the United Asso
ciated Presses to-day said:
"The result of the election in America
verifies my opinion of the honesty and
uprightness of the American people. I
believe that they will always vote against
repudiation in any form when the issue is
placed plainly before them.
"Whether the incoming Congress and
administration will comprehend that this
is no mere party business, we must wait
and see. I hope and trust teat there will
be a modification of the fiscal and com
mercial policies of such men as Bryan and
Sewall and their promulgation of issues
so destructive to the honor and pros
perity of the United States.
"This is what the people meant to
resent. The 3 effect has been good
here. Such an exhibition of the faith
and honesty of the American people can
not but have a good effect in restoring con
fidence in 5 the institutions and securities
of the United Btates."

PARIS. Fbakce, Nov. 3. -There is gen
eral jubilation in the American colony
over the election of McKinley, and Bryan
ltes virtually have no existence in Paris
Bankers, exporters and insurance men
are especially grateful. Hon. J. Meredith
Read, United States Consular-General in
Paris during the Franco-Prussian war, and
later United States Minister to Greece
describes the election of McKinley as v
victory of common-sense.
BERLIN, Gkkmany, Nov. 4 âThe lead
ing bankers and the bourse operator < here
declared that they were very well satisfied
with the result of the election in the
United States.
Exports say they will now expect
large orders which were placed upon the
condition of McKinley's election. The
official world of Germany fear that a hi K h
protective tariff in the United States is
impending. Embassador Uhl says that
trade with the United States will now be
revived.
The Nub Beorsen Zeitung says the
sound sense of i the American people
recognized in time the dancers to which
they would 'be expoaad by the free coin
ago of silver.
The Freissinnige Zeitung asserts that
the victory of the supporters of sound
money is a triumph of the sound sense of
the people of the United States.
The Cologne Gazette says: The condi
tions which brought McKinley to his
present position may prevent him
from relapsing into his former
sins. if the Senate* ' and House
of Representatives paxaiyea each other's
action on the tariff and silver questions
he will be the right man. The best thing
for him and for the country will be that I.c
play a negative role as President as he did
when he was Governor o! Ohio.

SOMEWHAT REASSURED.
But Mr. Bryan Knows There Is Not
a Shadow of Hopa.
LINCOLN, Nebr., Nov. 4.â The scene
at the Bryan residence to-night was much
ihe same as it was last evening. Mr.
Bryan, who left the house only once
durine the day and then to attend the
funeral of a neighbor, did not remain up
stairs as he did last nieht, but came down
into the library to receive the returns.
Some of the bulletins that came in were of
a reassuring character, and the Demo
cratic candidate plainly showed by his
manner that he felt more encouraged. A
number of friends who had held aloof
yesterday and to-day dropped in and
chatted pleasantly with him. Mrs. Bryan
also helped entertain the visitors. Like
r.er husband she seemed in good spirits.
Many of the telephone messages from
friends and supporters concernine the re
sult were answered by Mr. Bryan per
sonally. He talked very conservatively,
indicating in his replies to these inquiries
that official counts in some States might
be necessary to determine the result.
Excitement In Cincinnati.
CINCINNATI, Ohio, Nov. 4. âTne great
est exoitement exists in this city over the

an immense crowd packed in the streets
in front of the Enquirer office, where bul

quarters are being displayed.
The late returns have revived hope in
the breasts of the disheartened Democrat?,
and they are filling the air with their

POPULIST PARTY
Chairman Washburn Issues
a Statement to the
Voters.
Yet Claims That There Is a
Chance ior Bryan to Reach
the White House.
CANNOT SWALLOW DEFEAT.
Ridiculous Aspersions Cast Upon the
Intelligent Citizens Who Pre
vented Repudiation.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 4.â The following
statement of the Presidential situation
was issued to-night by Chairman Wash
liurn ol the Chicago heauquariers, Peo
ple's party committee:
To the voters of the United States: Our fa
cilities for receiving the election returns are
equal to any. We know from private advices
And the returns up to date that McKinley is
not elected. On the other hand, the latest re
turns justify our claim that Mr. Bryau is
elected. It is one of the peculiarities of the
Republican enterprise that they always claim
everything in sight a few hours after election.
In 1876, as well as in 1884. it was not known
for three or four days which candidate had
won. Although the early returns Indicated
Republican success, Democratic followed.
Again, four years ago, the early returns fa
vored Harrison's election, while the subse
quent ones elected Cleveland.
This year the early returns favored McKin
ley because they came from the Eastern and
Middle States, and from :he cities of other
States, while the returns from the South and
West were withheld so as to stampede public
sentiment that McKinley was elected, whether
he was or not, and thus create sentiment in
advance which would operate to his advantage
incase the election was contested, while on
the other hand, had the first returns an-
nounced Bryan's success and a contest re-
sulted, there would be an uprising of the
people through fear of a repetition of the
Tilden episode.
We have positive evidence that the Republi
can National Committee have wired their
State committees to claim certain States which
Â° are in doubt, fearing that the subsequent re
turns might indicate ilryan's election. We
â¢ shall soon vigorously preis the question, viz. :
"If It is not lor the purpose of manipulating
lhem why are they held back?"
We want the American people to be patient
and culm and to wait for the official returns
and pay no attention to the false reports sent
out by manipulating committees. We also
feel justified in assuring the people that If
Bryan is elected he will be seated. The will
of the people will never again be defeated
through the manipulation of returning
boards to capture tho Presidency. The politi
cal crime of 1876 will be resisted if repeated.
The returns this evening indicate that Mr.
Bryan will carry all the States west of the
Missouri River and south of the Ohio and
Poiomac, which, without Maryland and Dela
ware, make 209 votes. Delaware i.Â« still in
doubt, but we are sure of one elector, which
mÂ»kes 210. Add to tnis Michigan, fourteen
vet s, or Indiana, fifteen votes, and it insures
Bryan's election. The returns from both these
Slates now show positive gains for Bryan in
all of the suburban districts. The claims of
the Republicans are basea upon the reports ol
the cities. Now that we are hearing from tha
country the situation is rapidly changing.
The R.-pubiicans are becoming alarmed and
the silverites triumphant in the belief that
Bryan will be our next President.
George F. Washbukn,
Chairman Chicago Branch People's Party,

POPULISTS DIE HARD.
Hoping Against Hope That Bryan
Will Win Our.
WASHINGTON, D. C.. Nov. 4.âPopu
list headquarters were quiet to-night, but
a number of hopeful followers of Mr.
â¢ Bryan were there and declined to give up
the right. A statement was given out to
tbe effect that Bryan had carried every
Southern State except West Virginia,
' Maryland and possibly Kentucky, but he
thought the latter State would swing into
line.
â  Bryan, it was said, had carried every
State west of the Missouri River except
California, Oregon and North Dakota, all
of which it is claimed would probably go
for him on later returns. Indiana and
Minnesota were in doubt and if they went
for Bryan it would elect him.
The silver men, it was claimed, would
have over 150 members in the House of
Representatives and it was absolutely cer
tain that the silver men would control
the next Senate.
It was further stated that the Populists
had u:ec:ed over twenty Congressmen,
have secured Governors in probably three
fctates and certain of this in two or three
more States.
At Democratic headquarters Senator
Faulkner by no means conceded Bryan's
defeat. He was still hopeful that later re
turns would prove favorable to the Demo
cratic candidate. He was anxiously await
ing returns from Kentucky, which would
change he complexion of the situation.
LOYALTY AND HONESTY.
Verdict of the American People
Approved by the "Thunderer."
LONDON. Esq., Nor. 4.â Tbe Times
will say to-morrow: The people of the
United States have earned the congratu
lations of the world on the proof they
' have given of loyalty to National honor.
The whole stock in trade of self-seeking
politicians and flatterers has been spurned
and swept asiue by the plain honesty and
. simple common sense ot the countrymen
of Washington and Lincoln.
While we recognize to the fullest extent
the admirable temper displayed in this
severe trial we are not altogether sure
that McKiney's victory can be regarded
as finally quenching the Bryanite move
ment.
The elements of discontent to which
Bryan appealed will continue to exist and
even increase, but much depends upon
the use which McKiuley and his party
make of their unique opportunity.
A blundering course of policy disturbing
legislation and a disposition to use the
non-party majority for partisan purposes
would soon *nroduÂ«% a state of things
which would encourage Bryanism to re
raise its head.
The exuberant sense of relief arising
|* from the removal of the great danger
might produce an exaggerated effect.
Cleveland in 1892 had a majority about as
great as that of McKinley, yet the party
which was then victorious is now divided,
disorganized and despairing.
It will be to McKiniey's interest not less
than his duty to abstain from pressing
measures which may alienate from him
the gold Democrats, whose support has
contributed so much to his victory.
The Daily News will say: Mr. Bryan
committed the fatal mistake of attacking
tlie credit of the United States. A man
who runs amuck against the commercial
stability of the Union simpJy breaks his
head against a wal . Mr. Bryan assailed
the foundations of commerce, and the
commercial community has given him his
reward.
Tne News' article will ascribe McKin
ley's enormous majority not to his own
merits, but to the demerits of his opponent,
and will contend that he was not returned
for the purpose of reviving the tariff, but
to maintain the cold standard and a pure
dollar.
JEALUEST AND DEATB.
A. L. Snook Xmder* Hi* Wife and
Ihen Kiil* Him*elf.
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. Nov. 4.â A shock
ing trngeiiy tooK plnce at noon to-dny in
one of the most public places in the cily.
A. 1,. Snook, a well-known railroad man,
snot and killed his wife at the entrance to
the Hotel Belmont. and then committed
suicide.
Snook was insanely jealous of his wife.
Friends of the family say that he had no
reason to suspect his wife of wrong. But
he did so and made her life miserable by
watching her and accusing ncr of im
proper acts.
To-day he was evidently lying in wait
for her at the entrance to the hotel. He
was noticed walking backward and for
ward in front of the place for a consider
able time. When his wife approached the
place he hurriedly approached her and
spoke in a iow tone to her, at the name
time drawing a pistol from his pockei.
She turned from him as if endeavoring
to escape, and at the same moment be
fired.
Ihe ball strncfc her in the back of the
head and she fell dead to tbe sidewalk,
with the blood gushing from a ghastly
wound.
As soon as she fell and before any one
could lnterfer-, Snook placed the revolver
to his own head, and pulling the trigger
fell dead beside the body of hia wife. In
botu cases death was almost instan
taneous.
FIELD EIGHTY YEARS OLD.
The California Justice Congrat
ulated by Colleagues and
Friends.
He Is Opposed to Allowing President
Cleveland to Appoint His
Successor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 4 âAsso
ciate Justice Stephen J. Fi3ld is receiving
the congratulations of his colleagues and
his friends in general upon the fact that
he rounas to-day his eightieth year of life.
The distinguished member of the Su
preme judiciary has been nearly thirty
four years on the bench, and should he re
tain his position until next spring he will
have served longer than any other Asso
ciate Justice, the longest term of service
now on the records being that of Justice
Story of Massachusetts, who has served
thirty-four years.
Justice Field has been in poor health
for more than a year, but has persisted in
giving close attention to bis duties, ana it
is said that no member of the Supreme
Bench carries home more briefs than he
does.
A few months ago, trhen tbe venerable
jurist was seriously ill, it was reported
that he intended to tender his resigna
tion, but this was met by a prompt denial,
and the sentiment was attributed to him
that under no circumstances woulÂ«i he
give President Cleveland the opportunity
of appointing his successor.
Justice Field has had a picturesque ca
reer. When only 15 years of age he was
nursing cholera patients at Smyrna,
whither he had gone with his sister, who
was the wife of a missionary. Later he
landed in San Francisco with $1 in cash, a
diploma entitling him to practice lew and
sixty newspapers that he had broucht with
him irom New York, the sale of which
multiplied his ao:lar many times over.
His first venture into public life was
when he was elected Siate Alcalde from
the mining camp of Marysville. Next the
same region sent him to the California
Legislature.
Jn 1857 he was elected a Justice of the
Supreme Court of California and became
Chief Justice two years later. He was pro
moted to the Supreme Bench by President
Lincoln, and has taken part in many his
toric hearings. He has been noted as a
man ofinflexible will and when his mind
is once made up be is immovable.
FATAL POLITICAL FIGHT.
A Survivor of the Xotoriout Hntfltld
Family Kills lhrcÂ« Men.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 4.â News was
received here to-day from Williamson.
W. Va,, to the effect that a fatal fight took
place last night as the result of a quarrel
over politics.
Captain Hatfi*Â»ld, one of the participants
in the old Hatfield-McCoy ieud, which
caused bo many murders in that part of
f .he country, killed Hender*on Chamb rs
and Jobn and Elliott Rutherford of Maier
van.
Hatfield succeeded in escaping from the
place. His act caused the greatest indig
nation. Pursuit parties were at once
organized, and witbin a few hours 200
men were scouring the country in pursuit
of the fugitive.
Hatfield is familiar with all the country
in ttm part of the State, and there is a
chance that he may succeed in escaping
from his pursuers. Should he De ovei
tasen it is not likely he will be captured
aiive, for he knows very well that there
is lmle chance that he would live long
enough to be tried if he should fall into the
hanas of his enemies.

Many Blessings for Which the

THE NATION' 3 PRESERVATION.
Prosperous Citizens Reminded of

WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 4.âPresi

Thanksgiving proclamation:
Executive Mansion. )
Washington, D. C, Nov. 4. 1896. |
The people of the United States should never
be unmindful of the gratitude they owe the
God oi Nations for his watchful care which hns
shielded them from dire disaster and pointed
out to them the way of peace and happiness.
Nor should they ever refuse to acknowledge
with contrite hearts their proneneK* to turn
away from God.-, teachings and to follow with
sinful pride after their own devices.
To the end that these thoughts may be
quickened, it is fitting that on a day especially
appointed we should join together in ap
proaching the throne of grace with praise and
supplication.
Therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of
the United States, do hereby designate and set
apart Thursday, the 26th day of the present
month of November, to be kept and observed
as a day of thanksgiving and prayer through
out our land. On that day let every people
forego their usual work and occupation and
assemble in their accustomed places of wor
ship; let them, with one accord, render thanks
to the Kuler of the universe for our preserva
tion as a Nation and our deliverance from
threatened danger; for the peace that has
dwelt within our boundaries; for our defense
against disease and pestilence during the year
that has passed; for the plenteous rewards
mat have followed the labors of our husband
men, and for all the other blessings that Have
been vouchsafed to us.
And let us, through the mediation ot him
who hag taught us how to pray, implore the
forgiveness of our slna and a continuance of
heavenly favor.
Let us not forget on this day of thanksgiving
the poor and the needy and by deeds of char
ity let our offerings of praise be more accepta
ble in the sight of the Lord.
Witness my hand and the seal of the United
States, which I have caused to be hereunto af
fixed. Grover Cleveland.

NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 4.â The Rus
sian Minister of Railroads, who for over a
month has been engaeed in an inspection
of the transportation development of this
country from San Francisco to Boston,
sailed to-day for home on the steamer St.
Louis. He was accompanied by his son.
Prince Alexander Miciiaelovitch, and
Colonel Chertkoff of the Imperial Guards.
The Prince, who at one time worked in
this country as a common laborer, has
greatly enjoyed his visit, and he expects
io repeat it more leisurely some time in
the future.
YVhile as much secrecy has surrounded
some of his conferences with rail and car
manufacturers and others as marked the
commercial transactions of Li Hung
Chang yet it is understood that the visit
of Prince Hilkoff will result in American
manufacturers having a considerable
hanu in furnishing the supplies for the
great Sioerian railroad, and in the con
struction of which more rails will be laid
in Russia during the next few years than
in all the rest of the wor.d combined.

members of the Chamber have decided to
withdraw their intended interpellation
of the Government concerning the ex

having been shown that the last budget

reception of any foreign visitors to the
republic. The storekeepers also have
protested to the Radicals that any stir
ring up of the question of the entertain
ment of the Czar might militate against
future visits of royal personages, and
thus deprive them of considerab.e trade.
That there is logic in this protest is
evidenced by the Government return jnst
issued, and which shows that the sum
expended for hotel accommodations and
in stores, places of amusement and else
where by visitors to Paris during the
fetes in honor of the Czar exceeded
$16,000,000.

HE HAS A LI
HUNG CHANG COAT
The Latest Creation of the
King of the Dudes
Causes Applause.
A Rare and Radiant Collection
of Ties Brought From
Kansas City.
James Waldere Kirk, the king of the
dudes, oftentimes spoken of as the suc
cessor to Barry Wall, because of the
unique and varied assortment of raiment
that he possesses, is at the Palace. The
king brought along with him from the
East this time three trunfcs packed to their
utmost with clothing. In the varied col
lection are neckties of such extraordinary
patterns that they are the wonder of all
who have beheld them. Some are emerald,
cardinal and turquoise in color. Others are
checked and ciiss-crossed with black and
white, making them look much like the
trousers of a gambler in a mining camp.
However, Mr. Kirk is very discreie in
the use of his selection of ties. He knows
when to use one to fit the occasion, so he
says; but probably the greatest thing that
he brought with him here was a unique
garment which he calls the Li Hung
Chang coat. It is a brown overcoat and is
big enough for two gentlemen of the size
of KirK.
"This coat is my latest creation," said
he last night at the .Palace. "It is made
of a beautiful seal-brown material, the
cloth being a special color and finish. It
is made to fit v ecy loose, in fact so loose
that it might be able to contain two or
three men of my size. The shoulders are
bunt out two in ches wider than would be
required for an ordinary coat. This is to
carry the immense back or to produce the
Li Hung Chang effect, as ii might be
termed.
"There is a perfect fitover the shoulder-,
but two large folds start middle-ways and
hang in perfect fulness to the bottom
of the coat.
"Each of the folds in the back contains
about twelve inches of cloth extra auove
the amount required for the regular
proportions of uÂ»e back. The seams of
the coat are overlaid with a strap of the
same material half an inch wide, which
produces a beautiful effect. The bottom of
the sleeves are stitched six times and of
the same width as the strap. This elves
them the appearance of a finished cuff.
"You will see I have pockets galore â
four outside and four inside, but the out
s.de pockets are not for u.Â«e. They are all
pnt on as a patch with flaps. A coat of
this design would look very unfinished
without tnem. But to stuff <t lot of things
into them would make the coat hang
very badly. Therefore I don't use them.
The inside pockets can be used, as they
are so made that they hang separate from
the cloth or lining.
"The cloth was made by an English
woolen manufacturer and sent direct to
me and ihen constructed by ruy tailor, as
you see.
"I take great pleasure In stating that I
never had a garment made in New York
that vat superior to this.
'â¢There is no veiy great change in other
garments, except that the trousers are
Ã¼boutan inch smaller, both on knee and
bottom. The cv away and sack coats are
about two inches shorter.
"The double-breasted waistcoat is much
in favor now, especially in sack suits
made of cloth that carries a decided stripe.
"In trousers checks en shepard plaids
are essentially the tning for afternoon,
worn with frock coat and silk hat,
"The swell traveling suit is a shepard
plaid double-breasted coat and waistcoat;
cap to match.
"The round-toed shoe is just beginning to
make its appearance out here, although I
jredicted and adopted them two years
ago.
"About the scarf-ring which I brought
into use a year ago. I have several of the
most popular ones. They are set with
rubies and diamonds and emerald and
diamonds. Fancy waistcoats are very
popular, especially for driving or bicy
cling. I usually wear red while cycling."
Mr. KirK is only lacking in the yellow
jacket and three-eyed peacock leathers of
tbe Chinese statesman and diplomat to
make him bear a striking resemblance to
him. The Li Hung Chang overcoat ha*
been observed by guests of the Palace
with many outward signs of admiration.
The ties, which have been liicened unto
the coat of Joseph because of their numer
ous colors, were imported from Kansas
City. The overeat, trouserings and other
clothing are from that city and the East.
SPEAKER REED
AT PALO ALTO
A Few Words to Sludents
by the Man From
Maine.
Seeks to Show the Distinction
Between Learning and
Wisdom.
NO REFERENCE TO POLITICS.
"One Should Make Use of All He
Learns in This Exceedingly
Practical World."
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal,, Not.
4. â Stanford was visited for a short time
this morning by the Hon. Tom Reed. He
addressed a few remarks to the students,
but not a word as to politics nor the elec
tion.
Mr. Reed and his party drove to the
quadrangle in the Palo Alto 'bus. The
students enthusiastically encircled it and
when some one asked, "What's the matter
with Tom Reed?" the hearty response,
"He's all rrght, you bet, every time! 1 '
showed that Maine's favorite son held a
favored position in the hearts of the Stan
ford students.
Seeing that his audience would be satis
fied only with some expression from him
he Kindly consented to give a brief, in
formal talk. When introduced by Dr. Jor
dan Mr. Reed dismounted from the 'bus
and said :
"I see that presidents of universities, in
common with students and others, do not
fail io entrap the unwary traveler. I did
not intend to speak, but when in the com
pany of colleee students college recollec
tions crowd upon us. There is one thin?
I would like to impress upon you, and
that is tbe difference between learning
and wisdom. In passing through China
town in San Francisco I noticed that
tho i e who had ' the necessary tools for
their trade were considered thoroughly
educated. Universities fit us for the
affairs of life; they furnish the tools. Un
less use is made of them there is mental
degeneration. Wisdom is simply digested
learning. This is an exceedingly practical
world and one should make use of all he
learns."
HIGH GLEE AT PALO ALTO.
Much Enthusiasm Ovtr the Result of
tn,- Election.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal., Nov.
4.â Students here are generally rejoicing
over the result of the election, though the
Bryan men are wearing ill-concealed signs
of their disappointment at the defeat of
their candidate. Great crowds of students
filled the gymnasium to receive the re
turns, and as the figures were thrown on
the screen the McKinley enthusiasts had
food for their cheers and yelling, while
the Bryan supporters were in a most
quiescent state, and managed to create a
noise only when the returns from Montana
began io come in.
A straw ballot taken in the hall of all
those present showed that the McKinley
followers outnumbered the Bryan shout
ers by fifty votes, and that she sixth
amendment, if left to that single assem
bly, would carry Dy but five votes out of
nearly 160.
This morning Dr. Jordan, in addressing
one of his classes, expressed his pleasure
and satisfaction at the result of t. c elec
tion, and said that a statement made by
Hon. Tom Reed to him during tbe fore
noon expressed his own opinion exactly.
In substance tne statement was as follows:
"fhi-Â« ereat victory of Republican princi
ples is not tbe result of a contest between
North and South, or East and West, nor a
match of classes, nor even a victory of
Republicans over true Democrats, for true
Democrats have shown their loyalty and
I patriotism as clear! v as the Republicans;
! out it is an cverwhelmine decision on tho
part of the commercial paople of this
country, that they don't want its business
interfered with nor its prospects subjected
to experiment."
Professor Ross was completely astounded
at the result of the election and wouldn't
believe Bryan defeated, especially in Illi
nois and Indiana, until this morning.
DR. JORDAN'S EASTERN TRIP.
Will Confer With the I' resident on Bering
Sea Sealina.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.. Nov.
4. â Dr. Jordan leaves to-morrow evening
for the East, when he will personally pre
sent a statement to members of the Presi
dent's Cabinet in regard to the sealing in
Bering Sea, and suggestions, from a sci
entific standpoint, of the disastrous re
sults of such sealing. Dr. Jordan is hope
ful that the Governuient will at once ar
range with Great Britain for some method
of suppressing illegal sealing. He states
that the English scientists and commis
sioners with whom he has discussed the
subject agree that some international plan
should be adopted immediately. It will
be several weeks before Stanford Univer
sity's president will be able to return to
California.
PORTLAND CROOKS SENTENCED.
Two Old Offenders Oo to the: Penitentiary
for 'Three lenrs,
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 4.â C. T. Moore
and George Betz, two old San Quentln
inmates, were sentenced to three years
each in the Oregonian penitentiary to
day by Judge Stephens. They were con
victed of robbing Olipbant it Co.'s safe
of $80. Both men were implicated in the
wholesale theft of a large quantity of
silks in California, and Moore was con
victed and sent up under the name of
Martin. Betz was also in for robbery.
They are two of the smoothest crooks on
the coast and they seemed to have money
and friends, for every effort was made to
disprove the charges against them.
Robert Duvaile, another man not un
known to the detectives, was a member of
the trio and an indictment waits for him,
but he has not been caught.

of his paper's adverse views on silver, the
colonel havinc previously written him up.
PROSPERITY HAS COME

More Days ani Hours of Work fcr
Idle Men and a Considerab c
Advance in Wages.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Nov. 4.â The Leader
publishes the following this afternoon:
For about three years the skilled work
men employed in the Pennsylvania Rail
road's shops, between Pittsburg and Al
toona, have been *vorking only five days
in the week and only eight hours a day.
This morning the general superintendent
of tho division issued an order r< storine

at twelve hours a day and at an advance
in the wages of 10 cents per day all around
Notice to the above effect was posted at*

sult 600 idle men, who had anticipated the
turn of affairs, were on hand and went to

at the Walls and Altoona shops. Mr.
Chandler, ceneral secretary of the road's
department of the Y. M. C. A., stated that
the above order is the effect of yesterday's
election. Inquiry at the office of General
Agent Robert Pitcairn failed to secure a

USAL'S MURDER MYSTERY
Mudp-ett, the Recluse, Supposed to
Have Had Much Hidden
Weath.
Two Suspects Closely Watch dâAr
rival of O.'fic rs From Uklah
Anxiously Awaited.
USAL, Cal., Nov. 4. âElection day pre
vented the Sheriff and officers leaving
Ukian for the sceno of the Mudgett mur
der and incendiarism, although urgent
appeals were made by telegraph to county
officers !o come to Usal, as additional evi
dence had been secured against suspected
parties. It is a ninety-mile overland drive
from Ukiah to Usal, and developments
will be necessarily slow until the otficera
reach the scene. Two persons are sus
pected, and the nature of the evidence is
such that an immediate arrest will follow.
It U impossible to break the discreet cau
tion of the residents of Usai, who bold
that the least incaution or reflection would
put to flight the parties they believe to be
guilty of the crime.
Additional evidence bearing on the mo
tive of tbe crime was made more clearly
evident yesterday when a careful search
of the hall-burned house revealed every
article of value missing. The tact that
Mudgett was generally known to possess
wealth, has made his murder no general
surprise to old residents of the com
munity. The murdered man lived a sort
of a recluse life, confining: himself closely
to his own immeii-e domains. The rev
enue from his large cattle and sheep ranch
was being hoarded and is believed to have
been principally concealed about the
place. He employed no essistants to aid
him in conducting the vast amount of care
necessary to couduct his ranch. He was a
diligent worker and kept constantly busy.
The Coroner's inquest will not be con
ducted until after the arrival of the
Sht-riff, when developments of a sensa
tional nature are expected to follow.
COLLAPSE OF THE ST. PAUL.
After Many Days' Buffeting on the Moss
Beach Rocks the Steamship
Goes to Pieces.
PACIFIC GKOVE, Cal.. Nov. 4â The
Pacific Coast Steamship Company's
steamer St. Paul, which ran upon iha
rocks at Mos* Beach, near here, in August
last and which has stood firm against the
terrific force of the breakers that have
thundered upon it in the interim, has at
last gone to pieces. About 10 o'clock yes
terday morning at high tide the waves
dashed upon the dismantled hull with
such furry that it could not enduro the
strain longer and collapsed.
Tbe rocks and beach about the scene of
the wreck are strewn with wreckage.
Parts of the cabin and deck fixtures,
pieces of chairs and table which were left
upon the vessel when she was abandoned,
bits of wood and other things from the
damaged cargo which remained aboard,
and even the parts of a surrey, are to be
found upon tne beach. The masts and
rigging and the bolts and heavy iron from
the hull may be seen further out, and at
low tide the engines and boilers are dis
cernible firmly fixed upon the points of
rock that so long held the entire ship.
Seamen hereabouts consider it wonder
ful that the St. Paul should have re
mained intact so long, for the waves at
the place where she lay Â»ra at all times
violent and the wind has a sweep of great
force upon the laud. Crowds of people
have been to view the remains of the
wreck to-day and bits of dnltwood of all
sizes and shapes have been carried away
for mementoes.

NO BALM
FOR BRYAN
McKinley's Plurality in
This State Grows
Apace.
LIKELY TO REACH TEN
THOUSAND.
Country Precincts Add to the
Gains Recorded in San
Francisco.
DEMOCRATS GET ONLY TWO
CONGRESSMEN.
McLachlan in the Sixth and Bowers
in the Seventh Will Be
Returned.
McKinley's plurality in California will
reach nearly 10,000. Yesterday's strag
gling returns showed Republican gains in
all sections of the State, and the hope of
the fusionist managers and sympathizers
that Bryan would pass the Ohio states
man when the country precincts were
heard from was not realized. The plu
rality grew and grew, s'.owly bnt surely.
until at midnight it had reached 6931,
with 26S precincts to bear from. Later
returns are likely to add from 1000 to 3000
to these figures.
The vote for each candidate, as counted
up to midnight, was: McKiniey 133,291.
Bryan 126.36 L San Francisco, with one
precinct to hear from, gave McKiniey 30,
-84 S. Bryan 30,452, a Republican plurality
of 396.
The Legislature is certain to be Re
publican on joint ballot and a United
States Senator, who will assist President
McKiniey in his proposed tariff reforms,
will be elected at the coming session.
The Congressional situation has not
changed and California's delegation will
consist of five Republicans and two Demo
crats. In the Sixth and Seventh districts
the result was in doubt up to a late hour
last night, but tbe Republican candidates
retained their lead and seemed assured of
victory.
In the former district the vote at the
midnight compilation was: McLachlan
R. 15. 301, Barlow F. 17.247. Bowers R. in
the Seventh had 17,861 to Castle's F.
17.683. The missing precincts are not
likely to materially change this result.
Coneressman Bowers telegraphed to
The Call at 10 o'clock:
Incomplete returns show my election by 170
Plurality. W. YV. Bowers.
California has responded nobly to the
Nation's csll, and its voice is heard in the
chorus that sings excitingly of the tri
umph over repudiation, disorder and as
saults on the industries of the country.
FIRST DISTRICT.
HUMBOLDT.
EUREKA, Cal., Nov. 4.â The excite
ment over the election has continued here
all day and crowds have thronged the
headquarters of both parties. Since the
returns commenced coming in last nigbt
the Republicans have been confident and
jubilant, while the fusionists have been
correspondingly dubious and downcast.
The hopes of the latter were revived to
night by an alleged telegram from the
State chairman, claiming California and
the election of Bryan.
This county can be counted on for a
ma jority of 600 for Ai tKinley. The silver
leaders are greatly surprised at the Re
pnblican vote.
Protoction rather than the financial
question was the issue here, especially in
the wool-growing districts. Never were
so many ttraipht Repuiican tickets voted
here before. The Congressional and legis
lative rights were the hottest ever Known.
Cutler for Congress was slaughtered in his
own town and county.
Monteith cut no figure, receiving only
67 votes in the city precincts. Iv these
same precincts Baruani (R. ) obtained 1103
and Cutler 9SI, with the wool precincts to
hear from.
For State Senator thirty out of sixty
precincts of the county jrive GiUett R. 2190,
and Haynes F. 1716. * GiUett also carries
Del Norte. Haynes 1 stronghold, by 75.
Twenty-one ou; o! thirty-six precincts in
the Second Assembly District give Hill R.
1117, Devlin F. 994.
Eleven precincts out of twenty-four in
the Third Assembly District give Dajnon
(R.) 794, Waddington (fusion) 620. The
remaining precincts are in what is known
as the sheep country, which is solidly lor
protection snd will swell these majorities.
Conservative estimates. place that of Gil
lett lor State Senator at 900, and those of
HUI and Damon for the Assembly at 250
and 300 respectively.
The total vote of* tbe county was about
6000. Tbe thirty precincts give McKiniey
2100 and Bryan 1700.
SISKIYOU.
YREKA, Cal., Nov. 4.â Twenty-nine
precincts out of forty-two in this county
give Bryan 173 majority. The remaining
precincts will probably raise his majority
in the county to 250. The Democrats
have always claimed Siskiyou by 500.
JtJarham, Republican Congressional nomi-
Dee. is running ahead of his ticket and
will probabiy be almost even with Cutler.
"William Strain, Republican nominee for
the Assembly, is elected by over 200
majority in "the district comprising Del
None and Siskiyou counties. Judge
Beard, Republican" is re-elected by an
overwneiminc majority. The sixth amend
ment isdefeated in this county.
MARIN.
SAN RAFAEL, Cau. Nov. 4.â The total
Tote of this county for Presidential elect
ors is 2310. the plurality for McKiniey be
ing 592. The official returns will add to
this total about 40, scattered over the tick*
ets of the minor parties. Barham's plu
rality is 569. For Sta:e Senator 615 ma
jority for l'ickinson. For Assemblyman
472 plurality for Canavan. Tuis includes
every precinct, and the official returns
will make no material changes.
Leading- Republicans here are of the
opinion that Mann County must lay claim
to being the banner Republican county of
the State, and take steps to ascertain if
she is not the rightful successor to Los
Angeles in this regard. Marin's Republi
can majority is more than 25 per cent of
the entire vote of the county, which is
claimed to be a higher proportion than any
other county can show.
SHASTA.
REDDING, Cal., Nov: 4.â Complete re
turns from Redding. Old Diggings, Happy
Valley, Dryiien, Fr nch Gulch and Pa
cbeco gave a total vote as follows: Mc-
Kiniey 367. Bryan 507; Cutler F. 404, Bar

SECOND DISTRICT.
BUTTE.
CHICO, Cal., Nov. 4.â The Republicans
own this city and the county by a good
majority, and are having the full benefit
of the vic%ory. Nearly all the precinct
returns are in. Those still missing are in
the mountains and have small votes.
Thirty precincts out of fifty-five give Mc-
Kiniey 1544, Bryan 1474. Tbe vote for
Bryan represents the aggregate vote of
the Democrats and Populists. These
sine precincts two years ago trave an
aggregate Demo- Populist vote of 371 more
than the Republican vote. The Repub
licans this year have seventy-five more
than the two combined, a net gain in the
precincts of 447. At tbe same ratio, the
twenty-five precincts yet to be heard from
will increase the majority for McKiuley to
about 150 votes. This is a wonderful gain
for the partyâ in fact an avalanche to the
i Democrats, who had counted on a clear
majority of 500, while the best informed
Republicans had at all times conceded to
idem a majority ot 200 or 300.
DeVries ran ahead of his ticket, snow
ing Johnson under by a majority of 400
or 500.
Judge Gray's victory over Long D. will
be by about 1200 or 1300. There was quite
a hard right for Assemblyman. Stansel
and Thresher heve been exceedingly ac
tive since their nomination. Stansel R.
will go back to his old seat in tbe Assem
bly. The Democrats in the First Super
visor District elected their man, Ormsbv.
The bjard remains Republican, so i"ar as
learned.
The sixth amendment has carried by a
majority of 1000. The women made an
earnest fight and this is the result of
their labor.

SIXTH DISTRICT.
LOS ANGELES.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 4.â Owing
â¢to a few returns from some of the close
States of the East favorable to tke Bryan
cause, liberally doctored by a local news
paper, a howling gang of demo-pops has
had possession of the town to-night, de
spite the almost positive assurance of Me-
Kiniey's election. The legislative ticket
in the county stands six - Republican to
one fusionist, William Mead, who de
feated George F. McCullock in the
Seventy-third Assembly District by a re
duced majority.
The combine between Steve Cator and
Tom White has met with merited rebutce
at the latter's own home. Johnston Jones,
fusion candidate for the State Senate, is j
the especial fiiend of White. He was ,
nominated at "Our Steve's" dictation, and
White, residing in Jones' district, gave !
the latter's candidacy special attention .
and rendered all the assistance in his !
! power. Jones has been overwhelmingly j
j defeated by Robert N. Bulla. The other
1 Republicans elected to the Legislature,
from this county are Walter S. Melick, J.
C. Vossburg, iJrewster C. Kenyon, L. H.
Valentine and Captain John Cross.
All four Superior Judges on the Repub
j lican-ticket have been elected by large |
I majorities, except B. N. Smith, whose .

SANTA BARBARA.
LOS OLIVOS, Cau, Nov. 4.â Complete
returns from all prec;ncts in the Third
Supervisor District show the election of
E. St. John (Republican) over the incum
bent, E. de la Cuesta, by a majority of 17.
Tnis was the hottest fight in thecounty.
The incumbent threatens to contest Bal
lard Precinct, in which" case St. John will
contest the Santa Ynez District.

VENTURA, Cal., Nov. 4.â Ventura
County gives McKiniey 85 majority. To
land D. lor the Assemcly and Boyce R, for

SEVENTH DISTRICT.
SAN DIEGO.
SAN DIEGO, Cal , Nov. 4â Eighty out
of the eighty-six precincts of this county
have been heard from. The remaining
cix are: Aqua Caliente, Cargo Muchacho,
Picacho, Yuma, Smith Moumain and Oak
Grove. These cast 100 votes four years ago
and will not chance the result Bryan car
ries the county by less than 200. For Con
gress, Bowers, Republican, received a
plurality of 600.
Guy. Republican Assemblyman Seventy
ninth District, is elected by 256 plurality.
The Eightieth Assembly District is com
posed of the sixty-eight ontside precincts
of the county, and sixty precincts give the
following: Cox R. 1581, Dryrten P. 1625.

up and he may win.
For Superior Judges. Torrance R. and
Hughes D. are elected by 200 and 100 plu
rality, respectively. Swallow and Cherry
R. and Jasper D. are elected to the Board
of Supervisors.
There yvas intense excitement to-night
as bulletins came in from State, Congres
sional district and county. Congressman
W. W. Bowers received private dispatches
showing that his plurality in the district
is about 200. His friends are much wor
ried, but Deiieve be will pull through.
The fight for Assemblymen in the Eigh
tieth District and the close contest tor
Superior Judges have enlivened the local
â ituation. Tne Democratic Central Com
mittee hds persistently claimed Ohio,
Indiana and many of the Middle Western
States for Bryan, and their headquarters
were crowded with Bryan men. wbo dis
played great enthusiaaru, claiming their
champion was ahead. At one time offers
were made for even bets on Bryan, but
hundreds of dollars of Republican money
was produced and no takers were found.
The indications are that the woman
suffrage amendment was carried in this
county, but figures are not obtainable.
FRESNO.
FRESNO, Cal,. Nov. 4.â There are still
several outlying Bryan precincts to hear
from, but a careful estimate places the
fusion candidate's plurality at about 1000.
The precincts beard from up to midnight
give Bowers for Congress 2261 and Castle
2'vJJ. Tbe remaining precincts v.itl in
crease Castle's plurality to about 400. In
the two Assembly districts Moultrie and
Cartwrignt. tbe fusion candidates, were
electod by large majorities.
In the Second Supervisorial District
Manly P. was elected by about 50 major
ity. Sayre D. was re-elected in the Fifth
District by 5 majority. Alexander E.
Smith was elected Supervisor in this city
by 68 majority, after a bitter struggle. It
was a signal victory scored by the Repub
lican party for nonest government.
The Democrats and Populists became
satisfied during the day tnat Bryan would
be elected and took their turn at making
a demonstation, as the Republicans had
done the night before. The Republicans
maintained confidence, however, and their
eiDectations of to-night's returns were
realized. During the afternoon the re
port was abroad on the streets tha-t Bryan
had been elected beyond question.

WASHINGTON.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 4.â Secretary
Maloney of the fusion campaign commit
tee estimates Bryan's plurality in this
State at least 10,000, and returns at hand,
while in a measure incomplete, bear out
hi? prediction. Lewis and Jor.es, free
silver Congressional candidates, will have
about ihs same plurality. On joint bal
lot Maloney estimates that tbe Legisla
ture will stand 78 fusionists to 34 Republi
cans.
Tlie vote will, with holdover members
in the Senate, in all probability stand two
to one. Rogers fov Governor is elected
over Sullivan, Republican candidate, by
about 800.
POftT TOWNSEND, Wash.. Nov. 4â ln
the lace of the probability that this State
has gone against McKiniey, Jefferson
County stands pre-eminent among the
communities that have placed the stamp
of disapproval upon Populism and us
attendant trimming* â repudiation and
anarchy.
The sound-money ticket was successful
in the county with but a single exception â
Superintendent of Schools â to which posi
tion Mrs. Ryan, tbe cand.date of tne
People' < ticket, was elected.
OLYMPIA, Wash., Nov. 4.â 360 pre
cincts out of ll<x) in the State give Mc-
Kiniey 17,703, Bryan 23,461.

State.
SEATTLE, Wa=k., Nov. 4.â Secretary
Maloney of the fusion campaign commit
tee says the next State Legislature will
stand on joiut ballot 78 Fusionists and 34
Republicans.
m
OREGON.
PORTLAND, Or., Nov. 4.â Latest re
ports at headquarters make no material
changes in Oregon's vote, as predicted la
earlier dispatches. Those counties not
beard from are isolated from communica
tion, and it may be a day or two before
official figures can be had on the State.
McKinley's majority in Oregon is
safe, ii is stated, over expectei gains of
Populists in eastern counties in tne State.
To-night's scattering returns go beyond
the conservative estimates of sound-money
managers.
NEVADA.
CARSON, Nev., Nov. 4.â Carson City

Murphy R. for Supreme Judge 379. W. A.

Later returns add to Bryan'* plurality.
Historical Prophecies That Failed.
In these times of cheap vaticination
ana short-dated prophecies, it may not be
amiss to cast a retrospective glance on a
few of the most monumental mistakes
ever achieved in this line. Here are a few
of these famous contributions to the his-
Tory of human error:
1. Aristotle said that slavery would last
forever, or would cease oniy when the
shuttle would weave of its own accord.
A double mistake this, for slavery is all
but abolished, and, thanks to invention,
the shuttle may be said to work of its own
accord.
2. "Before fifty years are overall Europe
will be republican or Cossack," prophe
sied the exile of St. Helena in the firstdec
ade of this century. We are nearinc now
its fag end, but "Old Yurrup" is less re
publican than ever, and is still some way
from universal Cossackery.
3. "Italy is but a geosrapbical expres
sion and will never be anything else,"
opined Princ* Metternich, and just before
his death he saw what he considered
Utopia on the point of becoming a reality.
4. "The railways will never be of any
use for the transport of goods," sane out
M. Thiers, leading a choius of sententious
i economists.
5. "There is no morrow for universal
suffrage." exclaimed M. Guizot on the eve
of the very revolution which sent him
into exile and promulgated universal suf
frage as sovereign law.
6. "Never," was M. Rouher's answer to
those asking after Mentana when Rome
would become the capital of Italy. A
very short time after the trick was aone.
7. "The United States of Europe," was
the prophecy of al! a.dent democrats from
Victor Huco to Carlo Cal taneo, and its ful
fillment was to take piace immediately
after the downfall of the Napoleonic em
pire. It is twenty-five years now since
that eventful moment, bat the states of
Europe are, if anything, more disunited
and more aggressive than ever.
Perhaps the ancients, who knew a thine
or two. were right in saying tnatthe future
is on the lap of gods.â St. James Gazette.
The largest orchard in Great Britain is
at Tottington, in the county of Gloucester.
It is 500 acies in extent and in some sea
sons yields its owner, Lord Sudley, a profit
of Â£10,000. The trees are chiefly apples
and plums.

A Well-Digger's Xprve.
ABERDEEN, Md., Sept. 23.â A well
digger named Bhirley, employed by Frank
Ki.ey, had a thrilling experience on Tues
day "in the woodland lying northwest ol
Aberdeen, belonging to the Oaoorn Droth
ers. and saved his life only by great nerve
and presence of mind. The* timber is be
in^ cleared, and Riley's sawmill is at work
on it converting the trees into lumber for
building purposes.
Shirley was employed to deepen a well
and had placed a charge oi dynamite in
the bottom to blast a large rock that vts
In the way. After lighting the fuse he
came out of the well and waiteJ a suffi
cient length of time, as he thought, for
the fuse to burn. He returned to tbe well
amid many protests f-om a large number
of men employed at the mill. \Vh:'n the
bottom was reached he founrd the fnse
burning and in another Â»*eoad the explo
sion wouid take place. With remarkable
courage ancl presence of mind be I'lnch^.l
off tbe burning fuse with his thumb and
lingers, tnus saving 'iis life, as In soother
second he would have been blown in:o
pieces.
Facing death under such circumstances
was an ordeal well calcinated to tax ihe
nerve of any 02. "When Snirley came
out of the well he was not even pale. He
treated it as a caÂ»e of "snuffing out a slow
fuse or being >nuffed out.'" â Baltimore
Bun.
NEW TO-DAY.
DON'T LIKE IT
:_
When Made In a Wrong Way.
"I wish you would say to the people
some day that I don't believe more than
half those who try Postum, the health
coffee, for the first tima get it right In
my family the iirst time it was served the
color was thin and the taste sort of
watery without much character. , Come
to inquire, the cook had boiled it about
five minutes instead of fifteen; so the
next morning we tried it again and had
it coiled properly, then it came on with
the rich deep brown color of fine coffee,
I drink my coffee with cream and sugar,
and Postum bit my taste .very favorably.
Now we are daily users of Postum, the
food drinK, and stanch champions of it.
But if we had formed an opinion from the
first trial, when the fault was entirely our
own, we would have condemned it and
been denied the use of a beverage we
prize most highly, and which is .helping
us physically as well as adding to our
table comforts." .^
The above is almost a literal reproduc-
tion of a statement made to the advertise-
ment writer or the Dostum Cereal Co.
Lim., of Battle Creek, Mich., and contains
a fact that is well to not:ce. We do not
think he is qu ; te right in his estimate of
the percentage who blunder in the pre-
paration of the grain coffee. _
Our heavy Â«ales in this city indicate
that it is easily prepared and successfully.
Now and then a person may be careless in
brewing it and pet a very poor drink;
carelessness with tine coffee makes it disa-
greeable instead of a pleasant drink.
Postum properly brewed is delicious
and nourishing.
There is but one genuine original
Postum Cereal coffee, with a multitude
of imitations offered as " just as good."

ME^i, which weaken the organs and
cause them to waste away, thus produc-
ing Nervous Debility in all its distressing
forms. Ansoiii the many evil conse-
quences, of this â  deplorable disease are
drains which sap the vitality, night losses,
failing strength, aching back, diseased
kidneys, inflamed plancK variuocele, ny-
drocete, dizziness of the head, a tired, irri-
table feeling, gloominess and despondency,
poor memory and a wandering mind. In
many ca*es the disease if neglected ends
in insanity and an untime.y death. If
you have Nervous Debility or'nave any of
its symptoms it is your duty to get cured.
The way to get cured is to emoloy the doc-
tor of learning, the doctor of skill, the
doctor of ability. That doctor is DOCTOR
SWEANY, a physician whose ability i*
recognized, whote skill is unquestioned,
whose reputation i* eÂ«tab!iÂ«hed and whose
cured patients are scattered throughout
this vaÂ«t land as living monuments of bis
successful practice.
PRIVATE DISEASES, such, as

ease, contasious blood poisonâ tne curse
of humanity, which causes more suffering,

and 1 People's par;y candidates are known
to be elected so far, making a total of 60

How a PaviÂ« <:.Â«I>-Urlver Called Baron
Kothsrhild to Account.
Baron Rothschild got into a Paris bus
and found he had not a cent in his clothes.
The driver demanded: "What did you
pet in for if you had no money?" "lam
Baron Rothschild," exclaimed tne great
capitalist, "and there is ray caid." The
driver scornfully tossed the card away.
"Never heard of you before," said he. "and
don't want to hear of you again. What I
want is your fare."
The banker was in great haste. "Look
here; I've an order for a million"; he
proffered a coupon for that amount. The
driver stared and the passenpers laucheJ.
Fortunately a friend of the Baron entered
the omnibus at the moment, and, takinir
in the situation, immediately paid the
fare. The driver, realizing his mistake
and feeling remorseful, said tc the Baron :
"If you want 10 francs, sir. I don't mind
lending them to you on my own account."

HENRY C. DIBBLE'S VICTORY.
The Fortunate Oaes Wiio Have Wen
Their Honors After a HaYd
Struigie.
Notwithstanding ihe division in the ReÂ«
publican ranks and the number of candi
dates in the field for the honor of repre
senting the people of San Francisco in
the next Legislature, the Republican party
will aend eight representatives to Sacra
mento next January.
Edward I. Wolfe, the prominent young
lawyer of this City, will have the honor of
representing the Twenty-first Senatorial
District in the State Legislature for the
next four years.
To his popularity alone may he claim
the victory just won. â¢ â¢
Mr. Wolfe was born in Hull, Eng., and
twenty-two years aeo came to San Fran
cisco, where he has since resided. He is i\
graduate of the High School of this City,
and for nineteen years resided in the
Twenty-tirst Senatorial District. For
eight years he was in the employ of P. B.
Cornwall, president of the Black Diamond
Coal Company. In 1886 he was a candi
date for the State Senate on the Republi
can ticket. It was the year of the Demo
cratic tidal wave, nnd with the rest was
defeated, but in the district he received
the largest vote ever cast for a Republican
candidate. W. J. Ruddick, who was the
only Republican City official, appointed
E. I. "WOLFE. Senator - Elect
Twenty-First District*
him clerk of the probate department of the
Superior Court.
After that lie served two years under
Sheriff Laumeister, having charge of the
real estate department. Then he was ap
pointed secretary of the City Hall Com
missioners, remaining in that capacity
until he formed a law partnership with
Meyer Jacobs under the name of Jacobs &
Wolfe.
Mr. Wolfe is quite prominent in fra
ternal circles. He is president of the
Grand Lodge of the Inaependent Order of
B'nai B'rith ; he is supreme representa
tive of the Order of Chosen Friends, su
preme representative of the Foresters of
America and member of tho committee on
laws of the Grand Lodge of the Knights of
Pythias.
In whatever position Senator Wolfe has
been placed he has discharged the duties
of the office with marked ability and a
wish to at nil times and in all places leave
a mark of integrity behind him. The
Twenty-first Senatorial will be well and
faithfully represented.
The Thirtieth Assembly District has re
tnrnprl as its member to the Legislature
of 1897 Henry M. Kelly, a young man of
unimpeachahle character.
Henry M. Keliy is a native of Fan Fran
cisco, lie was born thirty years aeo in
the district wnich he will represent in the
Henry M. Kelly, Assemblyman
Thirtieth District.
Icwer house- of the State Legislature.
After acquiring his education he iearned
the plumbing trade, and on achieving his
master mechanic's degree from the
Plumbers' Association he joined Edward
F. Siebert as a copartner, since which
time they have done a lucrative business
in this City.
The Thirty-eighth AsÂ«embly District
has for its Assemblyman Gustnve Fohl
mann. The election of Mr. Pohimann
over that of his opponents is due to Mis
popularity in the district. His connection
wi;h various secret societies, especially
the Workmen and the Veteran Firemen,
besides the Foresters and others, did him
good service.
This was especially noticeable in the
case of the Veteran Firemen, who rolled
up their shirt sleeves, so to speak, in his
tehalf. The Workmen, doing likewise,
succeeded in sending him to Sacramento
on tne first Monday in January.
Mr. Pohlman is not a native son of this
Stale or Nation. He tirst saw the light oi
day in Germany forty-eight years ago, but !
when only a child he arrived in San Fran
cisco on the Ist of January, 1803, and has
ever since resided in the district which lie
now represents. He is a married man and !
has six children. By occupation he is a
jeweler, ana ha- a large trade not only
with his numerous society friends, but
with the generai public. ;
i. The banner Republican : district, the '
Thirty-ninth, stotd well to its colors on j
last Tuesday, despite the fact that there
were vigorous exertions ' made ' to 'defeat |
the regular Republican nominee, Leon E. i
Jone?. Nevertheless, he won out .â  by a
handsome majority, and will have the
honor of representing' his district in the
Assembly next spring at the State Capitol.
Leon E. Jones was born. in i'latte City
in 1841 and arrived in California in 1850.
In 1856 he went to ; Pennsylvania and
graduated from Meadeville Academy.
Soon after the opening ot the war, in 1862.
he entered the Twelfth Pennsylvania
Cavalry as private and served : with dis
tinction. He was at South Mountain. An
tictani, and was wounded in the battle of
Kernstown. In March. 1564, he was pro
moted to.be second lieutenant; in De
cember. 1864, to be first lieutenant, and in
1860 breveiea captain. In: March of the
' same. year, he'-' was- mustered out. Here-;
turned to California in 1869. and has re
sided in San. Francisco since 1879, having
served- the City as chief deputy under
Coroner Hughes ana in other, capacities.
He is a member of Thomas Post, G. :A. It.,
and the Loyal Legion. â¢ j
TtSijr. "M.* Bettman, member of the'
Legislature from the Fortieth District, was
born in Olympia. Wash., in 1863, was
brought to* this City as an infant and has
resided here ever since. Mr. P.ettmun is a
graduate of the Washington- Grammar
School. Some twenty years ago he entered

ni:in it To., Siz being tas secretary, treas
urer atul general manager. The ollices of
the concern are at 121 California street,
with warehouses on Vermont street, near
Alameda.
Mr. 15 ttman began being a Republican
long before he could vote, and has re
manou faithful to the p:irty down to date.
He has attended every municipal and
I State convention since LBBI ami has always
given his time, money and b?st energies
in advancing the principle* of the party.
Mr. Bettman was a member of the last
: Legislature and was active in securing the
I defeat of the bill repealing the fee bill.
| which saves to the taxpayer* about $10,000
a year, wh eh otherwise would have gone
into tbe pocket of the Sheriff. He also
: voted lor the bill granting to the Valley
j Railroad Company the lease of China
â â  basin, thereb}- giving to the people'i com
peting railroad an entrance into San J*'ran
ci s co.
Mr. Bettman's record during the session
of the Legislature is marked by an honesty
ot purpose that distinguishes him amonc
his fellows nnd which gathered about him
in his candidacy ior re-election a host of
friends who worked valiantly and secured
his election by a handsome majority.
Leon E. Jones, Assemblyman
Thirty-Ninth District.
It is almost a waste of time to attempt
to write anything regarding Judge Dibble
in the columns of a newspaper, so well
and favorably is this gentleman known
not only in San Francisco, but through
out the United States. Jndsje Dibble was
Assistant United States Attorney for Cali
fornia from 188") to 1887, when he resigned
to form a law partnership with Louis T.
Hagcin. In 18S8 he was elected to the
Legislature from the Forty-first Assembly
District, serving on several important
committees. He was the acknowledged
leader of his party in the House. When
elected a second time in 1890 he became
chairman of the Ways ami Means Com
mittee, and was on other leading com
mittees.
Mr. Dibble, since the wa r , has peserved
his interest in military affairs. " He was
Judge-Advocate, witn the rank of briga
dier-general, under Governor Kellogg in
Louisiana. He is also a prominent mem
of the Grand Army of the Republic,
having been twice elected commander of
the famous Lincoln Post of San Francisco,
and having served a term as junior vice
department commander of California.
Mr. Dibble has not confined himself to
his tyrofessional and political duties, but
lihh given evidence tbat had he chosen
literature as a field for his talents he could
have won fame in that direction. As it is
Sig M. Bettman, Assemblyman
Fortieth District.
he has done some effective work. His
style is striking, concise and attractive.
In fiction ais stories have attracted much
attention and he is known among journal
ists as a strong and vigorous editorial
writer.
As an orator Judge Dibble has few
superiors. With a well-modulated and
sonorous voice, lie combines an ever
ready command of language with convinc
ing reasoning powers. Gifted with no
Henry G Dibble, Assemblyman
Forty-First District.
small decree of personal magnetism, he is
a speaker who holds his audience with re
markable skill. 0
He has always taken a special interest
in educational matters. During the ab
sorbing and busy days of reconstruction
in Louisiana he served for s x successive
years as president of the Board of Educa
tion in New Orleans.
In private iife Mr. D-bb!e has made
many friends by his agreeable social
qualities. He has . been twice married.
His first wife was Miss Chapnell of New
Orleans, who died in 1873. In 1875 be was
married to Miss .Flash, also of New Or
leans. He has several children.
With such a record to look back anon,
as soldier, lawyer and statesman, de
scended l'rom a line of ancestors who have
helped to build up tbe country and make
it wnat it is, Henry C. Dibble has a right
to a prominent place among representa
tive citizens.
Lorenzo Henry." the Republican Assem
blyman of the Forty-second Assembly j
District, is a young man who commands!
considerable ir.iluence with the better
class of voters, as was expressed by their
preference on last Tuesday by electing
him, and a better man could hardly be !
chosen for the position, for Mr. Henry has j
a cood, clean record tnat must appeal to
all citizens desiring honest government.
Lorenzo A. Henry, Assemblyman
Forty-Second District.
f
That nis candidacy will appeal to the
worKingmen cf his distr.ct is a settled
fnct, because Mr. Henry understands the
dignity of laDor and has been prominently
identified with trades unionism ever since
h â¢ wa^ able to work for hims-clf.
He was born in San Francisco thirty
i seven years ago and h:ts lived in the
i Forty-second District about twenty-five
years and always taken an active part in
Republican politics there for the past
seventeen years. At present he is secre
tary of District Cub 2, of which T. P.
! lliordan, chairman of the Regular Itepub-
I lienn Convention, is president.
Mr. Henry is foreman of the pressroom
of George Spaulding & Co.'s printing
establishment and a charter member of
Pressmen's I) nion No. 24, which was or
ganized over â  decade ago.
After a lively and honorable bam paign
! fight the voters of the Fortv-thirJ As
j sembly District elected L3on Dennery for
their reprc entfitive in the lower house of
the State Legislature out of a field of con
testant?, and they will have no cause to
regret their choice.
Leon Dennery is a native of San Fran

years. He is secretary of the Mutual

aid to his co-laborers in their selection of
a United States Senator next January,
when that body sits in joint session with

will, no doubt make his influence felt on
the floor as a speaker and debater, for in
all councils of hia party in this City he
occupied a foremost station.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Now for prosperity.
The advance agent is here.
Ibere are good prospects for all.
Everything iv sight is as good as gold.
What will Grover say about it in his
message?
American business knows how to pro
tect itself.
It was not a landslide, but a continental
upheaval.
Every State that Bryan visited went for
McKiuley. _
It was not coercion but cohesion that
did the job.
The agitators of the country got the
grand shaice.
Conservatism knows how to assert itself
on occasions.
The solid South has melted into the rest
of the Union at last.
In the new era of prosperity California
should take a leading part.
We have seen the end of cheap money,
cheap labor and cheap statesmanship.
Confidence has been restored and every
body feels that better times are coming.
We have seen the end of the solid South
and there is comfort in that for patriots.
Perhaps the Cuban question may de
velop into a crisis, but it won't be a big
one.
Even those who voted for Bryan will
soon have reasons to be satisfied with the
result.
Now then, Popocrats, take your crow
good-naturedly â turkey time is coming
for all.
We can now turn onr attention to Great
Britain and take up the Venezuelan mat
ter again.
Democrats and Populists may now dis
entangle themselves from one another and
see where they are at.
The surviving Bryanite can be dis
tinguished in thes days by his eagerness
to change the subject.
Cleveland is great on phrase making,
but he cannot invent one to express hi 3
feelings on this occasion.
The Chronicle may rejoic? for a time over
the defeat of Colonel Taylor, but it will
be sorry for itself before long.
There will be lots of new blood in the
next Senate and it ousht to be good blood
and young blood with vigor in it.
Now is the time for enterprising men to
get together and make Dlans for the de
velopment of the State. There's millions
In it.
California has done well, but had there
been no dissension in the Republican ranks
in this City it would have been a clean
sweep. |
Now that honest money Democrats have
come out of the wilderness they had better
stay out and enlist for life in the party of
prosperity.
It is no loneer polite in the East to speak
of "taking the cake." The cultured
phrase is to say that McKinley walked off
with the premium tulip.
Before Willie Hearst started a news
paper m New York the State w*s Demo
cratic by a large majority, and now it has
become almost solidly Republican.
It 13 stated that high steppers will be
the favorites at the horse show in New
York this season, but it is not explained
whether this refers to the horses or the
ladies.
Republican success in California was
largely due to the fact that the party trea
son of the Chronicle was offset by the
coarseness and <iffensiveness of the Ex
aminer on the other side.
Let due honor be uiven to the Republi
can State Committee. It had a hard fight
in combating the fusion of Democrats
and Populists and has snatched victory
from tue very jaws of defeat.
Protection, sound money, reciprocity,
internal improvem- nts and the upbuild
ing of the American merchant marine
are things we may expect in the near
future, and they cannot come too soon.
Two things of local note are made clear
by tne result of the electionsâ the Examiner
gained nothing by its fraudulent tactics
and its coarse caricatures and the Chronicle
gained nothing by its party treason and
personal spite.
Had it not been for the ri -lit made by
the Chronicle aeainst the regular Republi
can ticket in this City there would nave
been a much larger victory for the party
in the State and loyal Republicans will
not fail to take note of the fact and act
on it.
*
According to the latest report of the
Commissioner of Patents there were issued
last year 22,057 patents, or one to every
â  2890 * persons in the country, and when we
. recall the hard times that prevailed, then
it would seem this is another proof that'
necessity is the mother of invention. '
TRIUMPHANT CONSERVATISM.
The significance of the overwhelming
victory of McKinley and Hobart is too
clear to be misunderstood. Many issues
were submitted to the people during the
campaign, but all of them when reduced
to the last analysis was a choice between
the maintenance of the exiiting order of
things and an endeavor to reform them
under tbe leadership of agitators, theorists
and dreamers.
The American people have had four
years' experience with theorists in office.
They trusted the management of tbe
affairs of the Government to free-traders
and philosophical speculators, and the
result has been disaster. The lesson of
that experience has been learned in every
household. Even among those who are
accounted wealthy there has been three
years of enforced economy, and in too
many homes of the land there has been
absolute destitution.
For three years the people have longed
for a restoration of good business. They
have desired to get rid of theorists in
office and to return to the sound and safe
methods which experience has taught to
be best for our welfare. They were in no
mood, therefore, to listen to men who, in
addition to tinkering with the tariff, de
sired to tinker also with finance. The dis
tress resulting from free trade foredoomed
any idea of an experiment with iret- silver.
Back of the sincere reformers in the con
test there waÂ«, moreover, a whole host of
agitators, some of whom were demagogues,
some of whom were fanatics and all of
whom were inexperienced in public affairs
and seemingly utterly reckless of conse
quences. If we credit most of these men
with honesty of purpose, there would still
remaiu among the most prominent of
them some who were clearly seeking the
gratification of ambition by methods which
were both dishonest and lawless. These
men became conspicuous as the leaders of
tbe Bryan campaign and public alarm was
excited at once.
The American people in a moment of
weakness were willing to trust to such
theorists as Gresharn and Wilson and
others who supported Cleveland, but
never in any mood would they be willine
to truit Altgeld, Tillman and those wfco
were back of Bryan. No cause led by these
men could fi.id favor with the majority of
the Americans. It was a foregone conclu
sion that the people would never follow
them in carrying out a policy which would
have meant revolution in finance, com
merce and industry. When the Chicago
platform Hnd the Chicago ticket were an
nounced to the people old party lines were
broken up, and the conservative elements
of all parties united for the maintenance
of good government.
This is tbe significance of the great vic
tory. The indorsement of protection,
reciprocity, sound money, liberal pen
sions to Union soldiers, the upbuilding of
a merchant marine, the extension of in
ternal improvements, the advancement of
American industries, were but parts of
one great whole. The prevailing senti
ment in all sections of the Union, includ
ing even the Democratic South, was the
overthrow of every foolish dreamer and
dangerous demagogue in the land. How
completely that sentiment worked its
will at the polls is made clear by the re
sults before us. Trie American people
have once more demonstrated their ca
pacity for self-government. They have
shown to the world that not even under
the stress 01 harJ times do they become
reckless and foolish. They have attested
not only iheir patriotism but the virtue
which makes patriotism wise enough as
well as strong enough to maintain se
curely a government of the people, by the
people, for the people, in unshaken sta
bility. â  \.
A FINAL PARADE.
Republicans of all ranks and conditions
are enthusiastic over the result in Califor
nia and there is a universal demand for a
crani parade and torchlight procession in
celebration of the victory.
The San Francisco County Committee
and the State Central Committee will
hold a joint session to-night to consider
the details of a plan to ratify on a grand
scale as soon as possible after the result is
definitely reported.
It is fit and proper that this celebration
be the finest e*er seen in tho West. The
place of the event has not yet been de
cided upon, but Colonel Stone very
properly suggests that to Oakland and
Alameda County belonc the honor of
having the parade, for it was on the soil
of Alameda County that the State was
saved from the hungry clutch of the
Bourbon anarchists who sought to
stampede this glonous State in
to the Bryan column. The Call
seconds Colonel Stone's suggestion. The
county that gave more than 5000 Republi
can majority and again became the banner
county of California ought to be honored
by the greatest political outpouring ever
seen in tbe Golden W st.
GOOD WORK WELL DONE.
The success achieved by the Republican
parly in California comes even to the most
sanguine almost in the nature of a sur
prise. The combination of Democrats and
Populists gayÂ» a clear ma]ority in opposi
tion to the Republican party when the
campaign began. Dissensions in Repub
lican ranks in this City occasioned by a
few sore- headed leaders in opposition to
the regular ticket added to the difficulty
of the contest. It seemed at one time as if
defeat was certain ; and that victory has
been accomplished is in the highest degree
creditable to the men who conducted the
campaign.
To Major McLaughlin and his feilow
members of the State Committee honor is
due from every loyal Republican. They
mannged every phase of the contest with
masterly skill and waged it from start to
finish with untiring energy. It may be
literally said of them that they organized
victory. They brought into the ranks not
only every loyal Republican but a suffi
cient number of good citizens from among
independents and honest-meney Demo
crats to overwhelm their enemies, and in
the grand triumph of the election they
have a right to wear the laurels of victory.
The County Central committees also de
serve honor and credit for the faithful ful
fillment of woric entrusted to them. In
every case they abiy upheld the State Cen
tral Committee and carried out all its
plans with the activity and zeal of skillful
and resolute lieutenants. To their efforts
it is due that the vote was brought out in
each locality and that so many Republi
cans have been elected in the face of what
seemed to be overwhelming odds.
An important feature of the campaign
was the work done by Republican clubs.
These carried out the plans arranged by
the committee and rallied to the party
those resolute and enterprising men who
fought for success in every part of the
field, and in the main accomplished vic
tory. Such great organizations as the
Union League Club, the McKinley Invin
cibles, the Plumed Knights, the Oakland
Alliance, the Sauta Clara County Repub
lican Club and other associations of the
kind were among the most potent means
of savins; the State from the Bryanites.
Among these cluba were meu represent
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1896.
ing every business and every industry of
the State. All of them are men who bad
affairs of their own to which to attend,
and yet during tbe whole of the long con
test they gave largely of their time, their
money and their energy to the cause of
-Republicanism. They did this for the
general good. They did it for the public
welfare, and their motives were those of
the best citizenship and the truest patriot
ism.
Therefore to the State committee, the
county committees aad the Republican
clubs the peopla of California owe a deep
debt of gratitude. They have redeemed
the State from what threatened to be a
disaster that would have amounted almost
to a disgrace. They have put California
in line with the progressive common
wealths of the Union and made it clear to
the Nation that the prevailing sentiment
of Californians is the same as that of tbe
conservative East. They have removed
her from the column of doubtful States
On all such issues as those involved in this
contest and made it certain that her elec
toral vote will always be cast for "patriot
ism, protection and prosperity."
THE DEFEAT OP TAYLOR.
The defeat of Colonel Taylor in this City
was due wholly tc the Chronicle, Boss
Kelly, Candidate Laumeister and ihe gang
which supported them in their treason to
the Republican organization. The chief
traitor in the combination was the Chroni
cle. Without the strength given by that
paper the conspirators against Republi
can success could have effected nothing.
Colonel Taylor would have b-?en the
Mayor-elect of the City and many another
good Republican now defeated would have
been successful in his aspirations.
Tne effect of the treason oi the Chronicle.
so disastrous in this City not oniy to the
Republican party but to the cause of pood
government, was felt throughout the State.
It disconcerted and discouraged Republi
cans everywhere. It carried confusion
into the ranks in every section of the
State, and many a Republican wo has
been defeated at the polls can trace his
defeat back to the dishonorable course
pursued here by a paper which professed
to have at heart the interest of Republi
canism, and yet sought by every means in
its power to defeat its candidates, weaken
its prestige and prevent its victory.
California would have given a large and
notable majority for McKinley over the
combined Populists and Democrats had it
not been for the dissension raised in San
Francisco by this gang of party traitors
for the gratification of their personal spite,
selfish ambitions and mean jealousies. It
is a matter of gratification that any sue
ceÂ«s at all was gained over so formidable
an opposition aided and abetted by such
formidable treason.
Due credit will be given to loyal Repub
licans who in the face of fusion opposi
tion and in defiance of party treason
fought and won the Â» great victory for pro
tection aud. sound money which gives
California an honored place ia tbe column
of American commonwealths whose elec
toral votes will be cast for McKiniey and
Hobart. While, however, that credit is
given where it is justly due, loyai Repub
licans will also take note where party
treason deserves condemnation and will
give that also with emphasis and vigor.
The Chronicle may rejoice thH morning
over the defeat of Colonel Taylor. bu f .
sooner or later it will have reason to re
gret its course. Tho Republican party,
which knows how to reward its friends,
Knows also how to punish those who have
betrayed it in the heat of the conflict and
endeavored to defeat it in the ballot.
When the voice of indignant Republican
ism makes itself heard the Chronicle and
its friends will find more cause for sorrow
then for rejoicing in the defeat of Colonel
Taylor, la the weakening of Republican
stiength all over tne State and in the
lessening of the vote for tue Presidential
ticket.
A NEEDED REBUKE.
The complete discomfiture of the Ex
aminer and the New York Journal by the
result of the campaign has given a needed
rebuke to degenerate journalism. It has
made clear the fact that the American
people will not be led by papers whose
money is earned by fakes and frauds,
whose politics are conducted by falsehood
and slanders, and whose circulation is
dependent upon those who delight in
coarse caricatures that carry vulgarity to
the verge of indecency.
What has the Examiner orofited by the
campaign in San Francisco? What has
the Journal profited by the campaign in
New York? Almost every man advocated
by these journals in each city has been
defeated. Even where they have been
successful they have been largely handi
capped by the pubiic condemnation of
the way in which they were supported by
Mr. Hearst's organs. In this City, had
it not been for the treason of the
Chronicle, which largely offset the coarse
ness of the Examiner, almost every Re
pub.ican would have been elected. Even
as it was large numbers of votes given for
the Republican ticket were influenced by
indignation against the Examiner tactics
and a desire to rebuke and condemn that
degenerate phase of journalism.
The disgusting and indecent picture*
which were labeled caricatures of Mr.
Hanna and which were so insistently pre
sented during the campaign produced a
feeling of nausea in the public mind.
Popular sentiment revolted at th-m and
reacted to the injury of the cause they
were designed to assist.
Cttlifornians who are natives of Maine
or of any of the New England States were
outraged by the coarse caricatures of
Thomas B. Reed, whom they justly
honor as the leading statesman of
that section of the Union, and not
a few of them who were inclined
to support the cause of free silver re
fused to support it when such support
would mean an approval of these carica
tures. Californians who are proud of the
hospitality of their Btate were offended
that its reputation should be endangered
by the insulting pictures of a distin
guished guest, and among these also were
many who mi ht otherwise have voted a
Democratic ticket, but scorned to indorse
such offenses against good manners and
good morals.
The defeat of the men who were advo
cated by these two creat exemplars of fake
journalism will be understood by the peo
ple as a condemnation of that journalism
as much as of the candidates it supported.
Certainly the defeat was so intended by
the people. The overthrow of Bryanism
is the repudiation of degenerate jour
nalism. The two things are but different
phases of the same evil. Bryanism in
politics is the natural accompaniment of
cud) journalism as is illustated in the
Examiner and the Journal. Such newspa
pers hreed such candidates, and such can
didates promise support to such newspa
pers for favors received. The triumph of
conservatism in the election means there
lore a repudiation of fakes both in politic*
and in the press. It means that morality,
honor and decency, as wel! as sound
money and protection, are included in the
stead last conservatism of the American
people.

MUSIC AND MUSICIANS,
Mist Rosalind Ellicott, an English musician,
has been elected an associate of the Royal
Academy of Music, in recognition of her work
as a composer. This young woman adds an
other to the already long list of rising femi
nine writers of music who are beginning to
wipe nway the reproach so often uttered by
men who deny the possession of intellectual
attainments to women â namely, "Whatever
else women have done, no woman has ever
written music that amounts to anything."
Like most of the male composers. Miss El
lirott showed her talent early, for at 6 years
of age she commenced writing little tunes
which, strange to say, were currectly harmon
ized. She studied composition, etc, at the Royal
Academy when she became old enough to take
serious lessons, and in 18S6 she produced an
overture wbich was performed at the Glouces
ter festival and at the Crystal Palace in 1891.
Since her debut in 1830 Miss Ellicott has
written regularly for the Gloucester festivals.
In 1889 her contribution was a cantata en
titled "Elysium," in 1892 a similar work,
"The Birth of Song," and in 1895 a fantasia
for piano and orchestra performed at the Crys
tal Palace, she has also written a choral
Miss Rosalind Ellicott, One of the
Coming Composers.
ballad for men's voices and orchestra, which
was given at the annual concert at Queen's
College, Oxford, while her part song, "Bring
the Bright Garlands," was given by the Bristol
Madrigal Society with such success that the
composer was promptly elected a member ol
the Incorporated Society of Musicians, which
was then holding a conierence in Bristol.
Miss Ellicott has a remarkable musical mem
ory, being able to carry a whole movement in
her bead before writing it out It is scarcely
necessary to add that she does her own orches
tration. She is a good singer and is in great
requisition as a soprano soloist at concerts.
Further explanations are to hand with re
gard to the Wagner manuscript discovered ai
Zurich. It seems that in 1878 M. Hegar, con
ductor of the leading orchestra in that town,
organized a musical fete in commemoration
of the twenty-fiith anniversary of ihe three
grand concerts Wagner had given in Zurich,
and Wagner sent him ior the occasion, through
nil editor in Paris, a number of orchestral
scores. On the reverse of the sheets were
some fragments of music written in the hand
of the Bayreuth master. Hegar did uot attach
much importauce to them uutil this year,
when the idea came into his bead ox examin
ing them and reconstructing from them an
entire symphony, which in the manuscript
bore this title, "Second Concert Overture, tue
orchestration of which is not completed." At
first it was hoped that this overture was one of
the nine compositions that Wagner wrote on
Goethe's "Faust," of which Bix only figure in
the archives at Bayreuth. Now that verifica
tions have been made it it discovered that the
Zurich manuscript is not unpublished, ior it
la the sicetcn for the overture in G major,
whicti was played in 1832 ai Leipsic, in 1873
at Bayreuth and in 1577 at Berlin.
The Flemish Lyric Theater at Antwerp has
just produced an unpublished opera by Jan
Biock, called "Herbergprincess" (Frincess of
the Inn). The occasion was & veritable sol
emnity; there were orations, ovations, palms
and embraces, for however great the enthusi
asm of the Latiu peoples can become on occa
sion it Is not to be compared to Flemish enthu
siasm when the peopie of Flanders once get
egged on to enthusiasm. The success won by
the opera was largely merited. The libretto by
M. de Tiere is simp c, even naif; it treats of
the eternal combat net ween pure love and
venial love, between good and evil. A young
musician, Merlin, abandons his fiancee for the
princess of an inn, a wily enchantress who
tries to baffle the pure affection of the fiancee
on every point. The opera end* with a scene
of carnage, which goes to show that in this
world virtue is rarely rewarded, but that vice
is generally punished. The Flemish papers
say of Jan Block's score that he is the
Teniers of music, and the comparison seems to
be just, for he seems able to touch the popular
heart and make it vibrate as Teniers did
with his paintings. "The Princess of the Inn"
is being translated from Flemish to French,
and will soon be represented in that language.
An Interesting letter, contributed by Felix
Draeseuke to a Dresden newspaper, descriDes
bow Richard Waguer first conceived the idea
of an invisible orchestra. It was at Purls,
during his stay there from 1839 to 1842, he
frequented the concerts at the Conservatoire.
One day he arrived a little late, and had to
wait till the end of a number in a place where
he was separated from the hall by a wooden
screen, which did not extend to the roof, how
ever. While standing there, Wapner remarked
that the effect of the invisible orchestra was
magnificent, and that tbe sound had a unity
which the orchestra did not possess when
heard in the hall. From that moment he pro
posed to produce a similar efl.-ct, and dreamed
of building a theater where he could carry out
the reform.
There is a good deal of statue-mania all over
Europe, but it is in Germany and France es
pecially that the people delight in "statufy
ing" local celebrities. A comical instance of
how this can be pushed to the borders of ridi
cu c has happened at Ruhla, iv Germany.
The burghers of RubU erected a monument
to the composer Lux, In the supposition that
he was the author of the popular Thuringian
melody, "Ah, How Is It Possib.e Thenl" A
monument for one melody was paying dear
for It, but now the discovery has been made
that the melody in question was really written
by the well-known song writer, Kuchen. The
status to Lux has become a luxury that the
people of Ruhla do Dot know how to dis
pose of.
Mile. Jane Harding, who is billed among
Maplesou's stars for his Western tour, has just
made her Belgian debut at the Monuaie Thea
ter. Le Menestrel says of her: "The beautiful
debutante displayed a magnificence in her
toilette and jewelry which amply confirmed
all the advance notices. With regard to her
powers as a sineor and au actress the best that
one can say Is that her pretty little voice and
evident desire to pie.ise were insufficient for a
svage like that of the Monnaie."
It Is stated that the relatives of the late
Katherina Klafsky are bringing a suit for Hbel
against a certain pt.-rsou who circulated the
rumor that the famous singer committed sui
cide. It is a strange fact, however, that very
few details of Klafsky's last sickness and death
have been made public.
The Emperor of Austria has just conferred
on Carl Goldmark the cross of the Order of

A JOKE ON THE CAPTAINS
A Grewsome Joke Played on
the Master of the
Vigilant.
Morgue Wagon Summoned for a
Corpse That Proved to Ba
a Dummy.
The crew of the big tug Fearles3 had lots
of fun with the men on the Vigilant and
Active last Tuesday night. They hung a
dummy on the fence, and in the dark it
was mistaken for a corpse. In conse
quence the Morgue was rung up by the
captain of the Vigilant, and the wagon
was sent to Fol*om-street wharf to carry
away the "suicide." When the search
light was turned on the remains the hoax
was at once plain. It was an old suit of
clothes stuffed with straw and a false face
for a head. Around the neck was the
rope, and one hand was up to the neck, or
where the neck should have been, as if to
pull the cord away. On the breast of the
dummy was the single word "Bryan."
Captain John &iluvitch of the tug Vigi
lant is an ardent follower of sound money
and is also a stanch Republican. Tuesday
night last be was on wa eh, but occasion
ally paid a visit to the office at the head of
the wharf to learn how the election was
going. On his way bacK to the vessel
about 11 p. m. Fred Anderson of the Active,
in his mad rare up the wharf, almost
knocked him down.
"My God, captain," panted he, "there
is a man down there who has hung him
self on the fence. What can we do?"
Silovitch went to the scene and one look
was enough for him. It was very dark: at
the time and only an imperfect view could
be gained. He at once made tracks up
the wharf. "Biily," gasped he to the as
sistant superintendent. "Billy, there's a
deaa man hanging on the fence just op
posite the Vigilant. King up the Morgue,
quick, and have it taken away."
"What's the matter with you, John?"
asked Manning. "Men aon't hang them
selves on election night What does the
stiff look like?"
"He's fairly well dressed," answered
Captain Silovitch, "and looks something
like one of the firemen on the Fearless.
Anyhow he's dead, and the sooner you
get the Morgue wagon the better."
It was then that Manning rang in for the
Morgue wagon, and Deputy Coroner Hal
lett went post haste to the scene. An
examination revealed the hoax, and tbe
joke has been on Captain Silovitch of the
Vieiiant and Fnd Anderson of the Active
ever since. Both assert that they knew it
was a Bryan joke from the first, but there
is not a man around the Folsom-street
wharves who believes them.

ABSOLUTELY PURE
SHOWING ITSELF
IN COURT AGAIN
Third Appeal of the Hale
& Norcross Now
Pending.
Question of Alleged Conspiracy
D,scussed at Some
Length.
THE METHODS OF ASSAYING.
Claim Advanced That the Differencj
Between Two Modes Involves
Over $300,000.
The litigation to which W. W. Fox and
the Hale & Norcross Silver Mining Com
pany are parties is once more before the
Supreme Court of the State upon the
third appeal. The brief of the appellants,
the Jrtale & Norcross Company, was placed
on file yesterday. In the caae there is
engaged a long array of legal talent for
the appellants, including W. F. Herrin,
Lloyd & Wood, Garber, Boalt & Bishop,
Bishop & Wheeler and W. E. F. Deal.
The brief ia very long, and embraces Â«
much that is of interest in view of the^
amount involved and the great amount of
publicity which the case has achieved.
A part of the space is given up to the
discussion of the allegations concerning
conspiracy, which were the sensational
part of the proceedings at the outset. "A
simple conspiracy," says the attorneys for
the appellants, "however atrocious, unless
it results in actual damage to the party,
never was the subject of civil action, and,
though such con piracy be charged, the
averrment is immaterial and need not be
proved.
"The complainant will not be allowed
to extend the inquiry beyond ihe plaia
allegation of his complaint, because he
may have charged in other parts of his
pleadings the existence of the general
conspiracy to wrong the Hale & Norcross
Company. Fraud must be specifically
charged, and the burden of proof is upon
him who alleges it. Hence we find the
plaintiff is required to sustain his allega
tions, und failing in that he is not entitled
to recover. Tried by the standards thua
raised the case will very quickly end."
The grounds upon which the third ap
peal is based are many, among them being
the alleged failure of the proof of allega
tion, the alleged error of the Superior
Court in its determination of the value of
the ore delivered to the mills, and that
"tue case is wholly barren of any evidence
to support or justify a finding of fraudu
lent or imperfect milling of the Hale &
Norcross ores at the Nevada and Mexican
mills."
The brief also sets un that there was a
difference ol $326,488 54 between the two
modes of determining the value of the
ore. The battery sample assays show, it
was alleged, the true value and the car
sample assays proved unreliable. Only
the fine ore was selected for sample and
that method gave an exaggerated value.
These are some of the claims set up on the
third appeal.
CONTRACT AWARDED
Bateman Bros.' Bid on the Xew Munici-
pal Building Was the Lowest
Offered.
The Board of Supervisors has apparently
determined not to waste any time in get
line the new municipal building uniier
way now that the bids for construction
have been received. When the proposals
were opened on Monday they were re
ferred to the Municipal buildings Com
mittee to determine which was the most
advantageous to the City, and whether
the bidders were responsible.
The committee held a meeting yester
day and award d the valuable contract to
Bateman Bros. fors 254,600. Tbis was the
lowest bid. The other bidders whose
tender 3 were considered were: T c Cali
fornia Construe ion Company, $269,883 40-
J. F. Riiey, $274,172; M. Mi-G-nwan, $273 ~
900; and James P. Leahy, $274,350.
The ground on which the main building
is to be constructed has been cleared up,
and work on the foundations of the fine
structure will be begun very shortly. The
Morgue building is to be torn down as
soon as the contractors are ready to begin
rebuilding.

A REMARKABLE BOOK.
It Was Written by a Man Who Had
I Lost Both of His Hands.
. It is not very often that a book is writ
ten by a man without hands, and is at the
. the same time able, as one might say, to
stand on his own feet. ThÂ»re bare been
: freak? and nothing mor\ This, however,
" was not the case with a very interesting
book. Mr. Cooper Chad wick's "Three
Years witn LobenKula," of which every
wprd was written by the author with a
pen after he had lost both his hands by a
gun accident in llashonaland. It was
done with a penholder tied to the stump
of his right arm.
The stereotyped phrase as to thÂ« ''facile
â¢ pen" might sound rather out of the way
in such a connection as tnis. At the same
time it would nevertheless be quite ap
plicable. The book is a clearly drawn,
naturally colored picture of soldiering and
"wild life in South Africa. Her*, for in
stance, is a vivid sketch 0} the "justice"
of the gentle Lo Ben, on whom a good
deal of maudlin sentiment has been
wasted in this country. A. man bad been
guilty of the terrible offensa of stealing
some of the Kind's b. er. He was caught
and this is what happened:
"The King turned and slowly addressed
him. "You have disobeyed the Kind's
commands and drunk his beer. Your
ears will not listen to the King's orders,
bo they are of no further use to you. Cut
off bis ears.' Two attendants immediately
sprang up and cut off the man's ear* close
to his head. "You have tasted the Kin . 's
beer ; with your toneue. Cut out bis
tongue.' was the next order, which was
promptly carried out. . Alter a little
time the King said : 'Your nose has
smelt the King's beer.. Cut off his nose.'
Thi-. was faithfully performed by tee two
executioners, who appeared to enjoy, their
sickening woric. Filially the K:ng said:
"Your eyes have seen the King's beer.
Cover his eyes." This vas done by peel-
Ing down the skin of 'he forehead until it
limped over the wretched man's eyes.
The King tb^a waved his hand to have
" the man t^Ken out of his presence, and he
was left to die on toe veldt at the merry
p.*. the wolves and jackals.â Pearson's

FIERCE EIRE IN THE
GLOBE THEATER
When Flames Start Behind
the Stage There Is a
Stampede.
THE STAGE MANAGER INJURED
St. Louis Visited by an Early Con
flargation in Which Much Dam
age Is Done.
ST. LOUIS, Mo.. Nov. s.â The Globe
Theater, Defreen Walnut and Elm streets
on Seventh street, was entirely destroyed
by fire about 3 o'clock ths morning.
When flames were discovered back of
the stage at 2:50 o'clock forty persons,
men and women, were in the building.
The fire spread rapidly, but all the occu
pants escaped, though with difficulty.
William Gray, the stage manager,
jumped from the third-story window and
sustained fatal injuries.
The Garner Hotel caught fire in the
rear and was damaged considerably. The
loss on the theater building is $15,000.
"SO LONG."
The Probable Origin of This Often-Used
Phrase.
An interesting copy of clearly original
verses was picked up in Holloway Jail not
long ago; original, that is, in substance,
although the author may have borrowed a
phrase here and there from earlier poets,
says Household Words.
.'.': Ob, liberty, bow sweet yon are t.
You seem so^jear anil yet so far;
'. he heart tof you does Ion? attain; â 
But still. I am myself 10 titanic Â '
i'or k* tung drunk and doing wrong â 
lias brought me to this doom. So long.
The last words of this stanza are evi
dently 10 be read as meaning farewell, for
the phrase "so long" has, among work
men and others, entirely superseded every
other kind of : parting salutation. "Good*
by,"'.'ta, ta," "farewell," "good-day, are
entirely 'abandoned in favor of the mys
terious words in : question, but we are not
aware that they have previously been used
in serious verse. Some say "that the
phrase was brought by Tommy Atkins
from India, and that it is simply a corrup
tion of the Eastern "salaam," meaning
'peace be with you." -
.But it seems rather to come from Aus
tralia, where it is in extensive use among
all \ classes ' and it probably; spines from
that sense of comradeship and politeness
which : prompts ;; similar expressions in
French, as '.'a bientot, "a '; bantct,'.' which
may be paraphrased "to our speedy meet
ing," phrases which, however . conven
tional, are expressive of good will. The
Welshman, too, does not think it polite or
even lucky to separate from a friend with
a mere curt benediction.- "See you again,"
he will probably cry with unction or utter
some equivalent phrase . in Welsh. The
Corn an, too, - has the same - delicate
sense Â£of courtesy. And we : may . fairly
guess that the "so long" comes Irom the
gold mines and means in effect, "1 shall
find the time 'so .' long' till ;. I :. tee â¢ you
attain." V .
Of the gold coins now in circulation in
England a small proportion only bear an
earlier date than 1879.

NOW FOR A GRAND
RATIFICATION
Republican Leaders Prepar
ing for the Cele
bration.
The Election of McKinley Will
Bi Ratified in Fitting
Style.
MAY BE HELD IN OAKLAND.
Suggestion That the Great Demon-
strati :n B; Hld ia the Ban*
ncr City.
Now that the victory of McKinley is an
assured fact and the leaders of the Re
publican party in San Francisco have
settled down to enjoy it, there has arisen
a desire lor a prand ratification worthy
of the prodigious success which has
crowned the struggle for prot-ction. And
such a demonstration there will be within
a week or ten days, or as soon as all the
returns are in, and the bulk of the people
are ready for it.
That a monster ratification was already
in the air was certain last night. It is
growing now and before this day comes to
a close it will have crystalized into
deiinite form. Then every Republican
organization in town will be informed
that the election will be ratified, and it is
believed they will respond quite as gen
erously as they did when the great day
parade passed through San Francisco.
The Republican parade committee h Id
a meeting at its headquarters, 24 Fourth
street, last nigat, and tne proposition was
then made to begin arrangements for the
ratification. Colonel Sumner was in the
chair and A. de ia Torre Jr., the indus
trious secretary, was at his desk as usual.
Instead of taking ui> the ratification
demonstration, however, the committee
considered bills from tbe parade, and
after deciding to hp.v all bills paid at the
Columoia Bank. Â§ J3G Bnsn street, between
the hours of 12 and 3 P. m. any day, the
committee adjourned sine die.
The matter of tbe ratification and rally
was left to the Republican State Central
Committee and tbe Republican County
'Committee, > as it appeared to be wholly
within tne jurisdiction of thesÂ« bodies.
The State Central Committee will meet
to-night and will take under consideration
the preliminaries of arrangement of the
ratification.
Colonel Stone will make the suggestion
that the ratification be neld in Oakland,
for the reason that Alameda County has
proved itself to be the banner Republican
county of the State. Alameda gave Mc-
Kinley a majority of 5000, and thereby
saved the State for him. Consequently it
is said that this much is due to Oakland,
and a strong effort will be made to ratify
in that city.
A CARLOAD OF FOOD FISH

was a failure, for the entire lot died on
the way. There were too many of them
in tne tank.
The diamond-backed terrapin is the ter
rapin par excellence of the Chesapeake
Bay. It is growing very scarce, and at
present they sell in the East for about $75
a dozen. The Commissioners will deposit
them in the brakish waters of the Ban
Francisco Bay region. Humboldt Bay,
California, and Y..quina Bay, Oregon, will
be stocked w th tie oysters.
C. H. i.'ownseua. United States Fish
Commissioner, leaves to-nigbt to superin
tend the works.
Over one Hundred lobsters died on the
trip, but the ninety odd that were spared
were in fine condition, and will be imme
diately deposited off the coast of Monte
rpv, where a former planting was made in
1888.
It takes about six years for the lobster
to attain its full growth, bn f - they multi
ply so fast that results should De apparent
before a ereat while. The condition and
temperature of the water on this coast
has been studied, and it is believed it is
an ideai lobster region.
Although nothing has been learned of
the lobsters deposi;ed in Monterey Bay in
1888, it is believed they have increased
materially, and will soon be available for
food.
SHE CAUGHT THE SHIP.
And She Didn't Propose to Be Looked
Up as I sane for Doing It.
A Chicago girl was in Scotland. She
had made arrangements at the office of
the steamer in Glasgow to telegraph ncr
the hour to be decided upon for the sailing
of the ship she intended to take. Then
she partook herself to Highland wilds in
peace. She received no telegram, but on
the day set for the sailing of her steamer
she arrived in Glasgow and after leaving
her baggage at a hotel went to the steam
er's office to make inquiries. She was told
there that the boat was even then leaving
the wharf at Glasgow, but by taking train
at Greeimck Â«ne might overtake it at that
port. She rushed back to her hotel, saw
her baggage dashed upon a cab, caught
ihe train for Greenock and got there in
time to see the ocean liner pu.ling splen
< idly out to sea. Sue beckoned to a man
with a small tug, declaring that she must
catch the steamer, and in a few minutes
more was steaming madly after the big
ship.
The captain stopped the liner at the
frantic gestures of appeal from the men
on the tug, and the Chicago girl was
helped over the side of the steamer, while
the captain stood by and made a few re
marks. A little later the new passenger
found herself locked into her stateroom
by the stewardess. She rang%ber bell, got
her key from the outside from the stew
ard, who answered the bell, and when the
ship's doctor camedown to see the pas
senger believed to be insane he found the
door locked on the inside. Then the cap
tain came, and at his thunderous order
the Chicago girl unlocked her stateroom
door. The captain's demeanor was not
cnildlike nor biund, and his language was
suited to sailors in a storm. But tiie Chi
cago girl stood her ground. Bte explained
through the blue-streaked air about the
captain that sbe was no more insane than
he was, and that she had a perfect right,
in her opinion, to stop an ocean liner.
She had engaged her passage on that
particular steamer. This was her own
stateroom. T c company Had broken

The Count Was Practically
Completed This
Morning.
A VERY LARGE VOTE ON
WOMAN SUFFRAGE.
Some Rather Peculiar Features
That Were Developed by
the Count.
CLEAVAGE IN PUBLIC FAVOR
FELL ABOUT EVENLY.
Three Proposed Measures Were Adopted and
Three Were Rejected by Very Decisive
and Unmistakable Votes.
The complete returns for this City on
the general tlcicet in full from the 313 pre
cincts show some interesting results.
The constitutional amendments farad
variously. Amendment No. 1, exempting
â¢ mortgages and trust deeds from taxation,
is defeated ; and so also are amendment 3,
limiting the iiebilitv of stockholders in
corporations, and amendment G, the last
referring: to woman suffrage. The vote on
these amendments was as follows: No. 1,
11,124 for and 30,762 against; No. 3, 15,453
for and 20,025 against ; No. 6, 13,144 for and
33,5<36 against.
The amendments which carried in this
City are No. 2, whicn provides that all
elections shall be by ballot or by such
ether method as may be prescribed by
Jaw, providing that secrecy in voting be I
preserved and which received 25,GC3 votes !
in favor and 13,398 against; No. 4, prohib- !
iting the creation of corporations for
municipal purposes by special law. the
vote being "22.029 for and 15,134 against ;
and No. 6, which enables city charters to
fix the times, etc., for the terms of Police
Judges, members of the Board of Educa
tion, Police Commissioners and boards of
flection, the vote being 23,041 for and 16,
-127 against.
The amount of interest manifested in
the several amendments may be indicated
by t lie total vote concerning each, which
was as follows: No. 1. 41,85(J; N0. 2, 38,084;
No. 3, 35,478; No. 4, 37.7C3; No. 5. 88,168;
No. 'j, 4G.710. The woman suffrage amend
ment drew votes for and against, exceed
ing by 4824 votes the total drawn by the
next birheat.

LOCAL REPUBLICANS
The Party Will Not Soon

feated C. L. Taylor.
Laumeister's Ambition to B? As
sessor May as Well Be
Smothered.
IS A VICTIM OF HABI-XAXI.
Do YcunÂ» Is Held to Bs Even More
Culpab'e Than the Misguided
Candidate
I Colonel Charles L. Taylor is taking his !
i defeat at the hands of Kelly, Mahoney,
! M. H. de Young and other alleged Repub- [
i licans with that philosophy that charac
; terizes him as a politician, man of the
world and good citizen.
However, he Knows what brought about
his defeat, and is not at all diffident about ;
stating the causes.
"Mr. Laumeister has committed hari
â  kan if ever a man did, politically," he 1
I said last evening. "Laumeister has been i
treated very handsomely in the past by
the Republicans of this City and County,
j It comes wish very bad grace, therefore,
; fer him to assume the role of wedge in the
work of splitting up that party.
"He will fnnl tnat it does not pay. He
' has or did have ambitions for tne future
that might easily have been fulfilled, but
â heis as dead as a mackerel. The idea of a
; man hoping to be Mayor oi this City who
1 thought so iittle of himself anyhow as to |
accept the nomination after it had been !
offeredâ by such an outtit, tooâ to two \
different men before h;m and they baring '
, rcfu-od. Why, it is almost laughable. It I
! is only another illustration of a vaulting â 
1 r.mbition coupled with a very weak minu.
"For that reason I consider the jro- j
â¢ prietor of the Chronicle, M. 11. de Young, '
as well as the proprietors of the two even- j
i ing papers that profess to be champions of
Republicanism, more culpabie than he. !
The evidence is clear that they espoused i
; the cause of this candidate for money, j
He wrs not the candidate of the Republi- \
can party, but of a disreputable and mis- j
chief-making faction, bent rather oa the j
ruin ot the Republican party locally. !
Their part in ttie cri3is that resulted In i
tlie election of a Democrat will not be for- I
gotten any more than will that of Lav- i
i nu-isterand the other candidates on the !
' apostate ticket.
"This, however, b a comparatively ;
small matter," said the colonel, in con- j
elusion. "McKinley is elected, the coun
\ try is safe, and a period of prosperity for '
â  the whole country is before us. That is a j
bit of work that is good enough for one
' day."
Thomas P. Riorda:i, chairman of the i
R publican County Convention, sa:u last i
evening :
"The result of the vote locally will
teach some lessons, anyhow, that ought to
bear fruit. There is Charles Laumeister,
for instance, who expected to be a;ia coula 1
have been Assessor two years hence, but
who stands no moie chance now than I do 1
i of being President of the United States. !
He allowed his vanity to be tickled by a j
] few irresponsible people and he is third in |
; the race, perhaps fourth. Then there b I
I Asa Wells, a friend of mine and a man of
! hijih-standing In the community. He
1 ?aw his mistake on tlie last day. '
j Then there is Henry Martin, a cap- j
I italist. who has no more use for j
; the office of Treasurer than a wagon has j
j for a fifth wheel, hut they Mattered him !
into lendine his nime, like the other, to
give respectability to their ticket. The
result has been to handicap tiie legitimate
Republican nominees in their race and to
piFB the Democrats a measure of success in
,1 year when everything should have been I
Republican. There never was any ques
tion as to who the real candidates were. |
The title descended to it as certain iy as it I
does to a pece of real estate. Kelly aiid Ma- j
honey offered to arbitrate and to con
stiuue the State Central Comnritte
' as the arbitrators. But we said there was
I nothing to arbitrate sind refused. Â¥ney
1 tooli the matter before the State Central
j Committee anyhow and the decision was
; against them. They refused to submit to
I it, however, ana took it. 10 the State Su
i preme Court and the decision was aeainst
them there. And still they refused to
submit and went along in their work of
j scattering the Republican vote. .Now,
.Minpo?e we had assented to their demands.
Tiuy wanted us to share with them hall
the offices. If we had done so. what is to
prevent some irresponsibles bobbing up
eyery election and making the same de
mands. It would not do. But it has
doaf- ail parties to the blunder and dis
loyalty so much harm that I think they
will be slow to repeat it."
<ieorce T. Gnden. who is a free-silver
j P.ryanite, said: "The defeat of Colonel
; Taylor for the Mayoralty is a real misfor
' tune. I was as much inter,est*d in the
local ticket aa I was in the National. Tay
; lor has stood up manfully for the people
I in the Board of Supervisors, and has ren
dered this City such service as can scarcely
be overestimated. He stood in the breach
against big odds. He should have been
made Mayor not only as a reward, but be-
I cause ho has Â»o conclusively shown not
j only his honesty but his ability. His de
feat will t;e but poor encouragement for
any other to follow tn his ways."
"Charley Laumeister has made the
worst mistake of any of them, ana the
worst mistake he has ever made on his
own account. For a man who has re
ceived the consideration that he has at the
hands of his party somethint; very much
I etter was to have been expected at his
hands than to have gotten in with the
! Kelly-Mahonev outfit to throw the party
down at this juncture. Why, there wasn't
anything that we might not have had
; this year."
This was an expression by I. P. Kincaid
; at the County Republican headquarters
j last evening, and represented the general
expression of opinion by those who came
I and wont during the evening, discussing
1 the situation.
MIDWEEK THEATER NOTES
The Tabers' Engagement Draws
Near Its Close at the
Baldwin.
The Popular Ferris Hartman 'Takes
a B:n fit at the Tvcli
Tc-N ght.
The election excitement is still telling
heavily on the attendance at the theaters,
though things will no doubt have settled
i down to their normal condition by the
1 end of the week. At the Baldwin, last
I night, the T;ibers save their tina) perform
; ance of "As Yon LiUe It" to a house that
was unusually good, considering the pre
vailing interest in election returns. To
; nisrht the double bill of "Chattcrlon" and
i "The Love Chase" will be performed.
On Monday night Delia Fox opens at
: the Bald wiu.
Captain Herne's play at the Grand,
i "Drifting Apart," is not only highly dra
j matic, with well-worked up climaxes, but
! it is also well within the range of Droba
j bility. Miss Victory Bateman plays her
! part excellently, and is as much at home
j as the honored guest in a splendidly ap
i pointed house as she is as the village
I maiden in her cottage. â¢ The stage-struck
j Hester and her lover make themselves at
I home ererywhere, and devote all their su
! perfluous energy to the pursuit of their
dramatic aspirations in a way which
proves highly amusinc to the audience.
There nre only a few more nights in
j which to .see "Tennessee's Pardner" at the
j Columbia Theater. It ij a play full of
] both humor and pathos, wbic.*! is well
: acted and arouses plenty of interest. Cor
j inne opens at the Columbia on Monday.
At the Tivoli Opsra-house this evening
a grand complimentary testimonial will
be tendered to Ferris Hartman. A new
; edition of "The Babes in the Wood"
! will be presented lor the occasion.
] Many societies, lodges and social gatber
! ingÂ«, for which he has so often obliged
and rendered his services, will send rep
resentatives to-night.
The California Theater reopens on Mon
day with "In Darkest Russia."
The Quaker City Quartet is continuing
I the htt made at the Orpheum on Monday
I nieht, and Howard's comic pianoforte
j playiag has caught on well. As stated in
The Cam. Miss d'Anstralio'a singing is
not of the kind likely to please a vande
ville audience, and realizing this the lady
has withdrawn from the programme.
AINSWORTH ESTATE.

Interest in It.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 4.â Mrs. Mar
garet S. Ainswortb, the widow of the late
George C. Ainswortb, residing at Clare
mont', has petitioned the County Court of
Portland, Or., for her dower interest in
the estate instead of a one-third at the ex
piration'tof five years as provided by the
will. Tins instrument was tiled for pro
bate October 29, 1893, there, and a copy of
it here December 31, 1895. It provided for
her holding all of the estate in trust, and
not later than five years after testator's
death divide it equally between herself
and the two children, Lawrence and Mabel

Whalers Are Now B.ing Refitted for
a Cruise in the Southern
Seas.
Disengaged ships are seeking high char
ters. Nearly every vessel that has come
here from Australia, England, China and
Japan has been "chartered prior to arri

for big prices. It just happens that tnere
are more vessels than wheat and until the
last year's crop begins to come in there
will not be much demand for ships.
Figuring on this state of affairs Captain
McKinnon took the Belford over to Sau
salito and now has tier hard and fast in
the mud. It is only a few months ago
since the last of the fleet that laid up in
Richardsons Bay last year was towed out

IS TOO LAZY TO WORK.
Edward Erickson, a Tramp,
Breaks Open a Postal-Box
on Bernal Heights.
He Admits That He Did It to Be S.nt
to Jail, Where He Would
Get Good Food.
Edward Erickson, a tramp, was arrested
yesterday afternoon by Policeman J. J.
Kern and booked at the Seventeenth
street station on tne charge of malicious
mischief, lie was later taken to the City
Prison and will be handed over to the
Federal authorities.
Between 12 and 1 o'clock Erickson broke
open a postal box with rocks on the cor
ner of Brewster and Cortez streets, Bernal
Heights. He was observed by two ladies,
who followed him till they met Police
man Kern and be placed him under ar
rest.
Erickson is a big, bulking fellow, 35
years of age, with very little intelligence.
He is a fine specimen of the tramp species
and has a horror of work.
"Whqt did 1 break open the box for?"
he said, in answer to a Question. "Weil,
I am tired of seeking for food and want to
be sent to jail, where I will get good food
and have nothing to do.
"Why don't I go to work? Well, be
cause I won't. I haven't done any work
for six months, and even if I wanted to I
couldn't get it here. I don't want to
work â that's about the size of it â as I am
too lazy. I have tried it, and don't see
any cooa in it."
"Why don't you go into the country
and get some easy job on one of the
ranches?"
"No, I won't. I have worked on
ranches, and never ypt saw an easy job on
them. I want to k'O to jail, and that's all
there is to it; so I thought if I broke open
the postal box I would get arrested. I
would have broken more if the policeman
badn't got me."
The boiler tubes of a large liner, if placed
in a row, would stretch nearly ten miles,
and tne condenser tubes more than
twenty-five miles.
SUDDEN RISE IN
STOCKS AND BONDS
Great Excitement in the
Exchange Over the
Elections.
United States Bonds Were "as
Good as Gold" at Any
Price.
ADVANCED $2 YESTERDAY.
San Francisco Sacurities Go Up From
$1 to $3 and Are H4i
Firmly.
The first flush of prosperity as a result
of the election of McKinley came early
yesterday morning. It came not in mere
talk, nor in hoping for better times, but
in the most substantial and positive man.
ner known. The success of tbe Repub
lican National ticket, and all it meant for
the Nation, made itself apparent to the
complete satisfaction of everybody con
cerned, and all that happened in the place
where the very securities of the United
States and of San Francisco were at stake
âin the btock and Bond Exchange of
S&n Francisco.
The change was like a bright sunny
morning after a long, tedious spell of dark
and gloomy days. Where but a few days
before, as has been asserted by several
bankers and stock - brokers, things
were dangerously close to a panic,
money was loose again, merchants,
brokers, capitalists and depositors in sav
ings banks were contented in their minds
and easy about money. But in the Stork
and Bond Exchange the feeling was more
than mere contentment, it bordered on
excitement all day â the opposite of a
panic, for the excitement had the nature
of a ratification combined with the pleas
ure of seeing securities rise with sudden
strides, the like of which was almost un
precedented.
In times of mining deals, when nobody
Knew what shares were worth from hour
to hour, there was no more genuine sensa
tion crfiated by the advance in stocks than
when yesterday the men of money un
loosed their purse strings and eagerly
rushed after bouds and securities. United
States bonds were again in tremendous de
mand by men who did not possess enough
of vbem"; but the men who were the tonu
nate owners of these securities declined to
part with the bonds.
When the morning session of the ex
change opened a broker bid $109 for 4 p9r
cent bonds (quarterly coupon or quarterly
registered) and $119 for 4 per cent quar
teriy coupon, aew.
When the exchange closed Monday
evening these were selling at $107 and $117
respectively. â¢
But the extraordinary bound of $2 was
no temptation to the holders of Uncle
Sam's bonds.
"United States bonds at 109anall9!"
exclaimed an enthusiastic bidder. "Wuo
wants to sell at 109 and 119?"
"Sell United States bonds now, oh, no;
they are as good as pold," repiied a broker.
"You nmst go higher."
The same astonishing rise took place in
stocks which are part of the securities of
San Francisco. For instance. Market
street Railway, California-street Railway,
Omnibus Railway, Sprinc Valley Water
Company, Sutter-street Railway, Pacific
Gas Improvement, ban Francisco Gas
light stocks advanced from $1 to $3; Edi
son Light and Power Com: any went from
li9>i to 123 iv the bids and sold for 122^.
Here is a clear advance of something
like 2 per cent. As those stocks represent
securities of San Francisco it is easy to
conclude from their *ipa*modic rise that
all other securities of the city would ad
vance in a corresponding ratio. The ben
eficial effect, therefore, may be imagined.
Real estate itself must have felt the in
lluence with the result that the City was
far more wealt.'iy yesterday in its values
tnau on Monday- For the sake of com
parison the following figures from the
Stock and Bond Exchange bulletins of
November 2 and November 4 are here

ATHLETICS AT NIGHT,
A Grand Entertainment at the
Olympic Club Next
Week.
A Chorns of Fifty Voices Will Ec a
Feature of the Musical

The directors of the Olympic Club are
leaving no stone unturned in their efforts
to make the entertainment of the evening
of the 11th intit. a success in every par
ticular. The ladies who will be present
on this occasion can certainly count upon
witnessing feats of athletic skill and
prowess that will equal if not surpass the
great professional performances occasion*
ally seen in some of the theaters of this
City. It will be noticed in the following
letter from that famous athlete and ener
getic leader of the club, Howard Taylor,
that particular attention will also be given
to the vocal and instrumental part ot the
programme. Mr. Taylor's letter is self
explanatory:
The Olympic Club will give a grand ladies'
night on me 11th lust., and in arrangement of
programme will surpass anything ever given
in tne club's irrmuujiuni. Ine members have
been working assiduously the past month
polishing up their latent energies and acquir
ing a neatness and finish to their respective
acts. The athletic programme, as already ar
ranged, shows a budget of novelties, mid, it
The Call's predilection is of any value, ought
to capiure the large and enthusiastic audienca
which will no doubt attend.
Assistant Leader La Rue and Professor
Belau deserve special praiso for developing
some remarkably clever gymnasts, who will
show their dariiiK mid skill on the above
evening. The triple bar* will again be in evi
dence, together with tumbling, leaping, box
ing and wrestling. A pole act by A. Cooper,
an exhibition on the slack wire by W. Dorn, a
burlesque boxing bout, representing McKimey
and Bryan, by Cornell and Empey; a juvonilu
class of fencers and a genuine duel bcene be
tween Pro.essor Trouchet and K. Lastreto,
will be some of the new features (it would not
do to tell all of them). The last-named event

at the advance, however, and about lc wai de
ducted from prices within the first half hour. The
de line was fo.low-il by a moderate rally. The
bulge was anticipated by a large number of trad

At Trieste three experienced divers are
just now engaged upon a : highly interest
ing task. In 1811 a terrible explosion took
place in the Harbor there, the 1 causes of
which have nerer been -explained. . Much
loss of life and property was caused, and
the Danae, ; a French . frigate,! was sunk.
The divers soon ascertained the position of
the hull; but all ; efforts to raise it have
beers in vain. The vessel | contains Â£120,000
in gold- and the valuable jewels of- a rich

Here is an electioneering card which is
being circulated in Atlanta by a candidate
for Coroner :
"From 12 to 33 years in the wilderness
and but little heard from.
"I am not a Republican.
"I am not a Democrat.
"I am not a Populist.
"I am not & politician.
"Bat I am a follower of Christ, so I will
say I am a candidate for Coroner and will
jjive at least $100 to a new church in the
western portion of the city near my home
if elected. My friends, as ever yours.
"F. E. A. Curtis."

THAT BANNER
Proud of Her Big Majority
Which Leads the
State.
Arrangements Made for a Grani
Ratification Parade Satur
day.
ALL AEE INVITED TO JOIN.
, Many Lively Scenes in the Streets
Only One Humorous Election Bet
Recordedâ Full Returns-
If California, when the official returns
â¢ are in, gives a majority for William Mc-
Kinley, Alameda County will justly claim
the credit of throwing the State's vote into
the electoral college.
No matter what happens, the Eepubli-
can banner, which was. taken from this
. county to Los Angeles four years ago, will
have to be returned, and that without de
lay. Alameda County held that banner
for many years and regarded it as one of
the most precious of her possessions. She
was justly proud of it and its depar
ture from the southern county resembled
somewhat the funeral of a pioneer. Its
return will probably be celebrated with all
the'guafcing affection and demonstration
that might be expected of a loving couple
who, being once divorced, decide that they
cannot live apart and agree to a reunion.
The estimate o!' 50*30 majority predicted
in this moruine's Call was more modest
than the returns justify. When the of
ficial count is made this number will be
exceeded by 300 or 400. This is the largest
Republican majority that Alameda has
ever given, and certain it is that nowhere
else in the State has anything near this
amount been returned at this election.
At soon as it was known that the county
had returned to its former Republican
â¢ love it was decided to lose no time to rat-
ify on the streets what had taken clace at
the polls. The National Republican
â¢League tnis afternoon, in conjunction with
the County Central Committee, decided to
hold a ratification and jollification to
morrow nipht, but this was later changed
to Saturday. \Villiara R. Davis, the presi
dent of the National Republican League
. of Alameda County, issued the following
â¢ notice this afternoon:
National Republican Leagueâ attention ! j
Saturday evening every member is sum- i
â¢ moned to be at headquarters, 1000 Broadway,
at 7:30 o'clock sharp. In co-operation with I
the Alliance, the Army and Navy League, the
Young Men's Republican League and the uni- !
formed ciubs of Alameda County we are going
to celebrete the triumph in the United States, j
. in California and in Alameda County of the
. principles of sound government, sound money 1
anu sound American sense. Bring enthusi
asm. The cause and tbe overwhelming vic
tory call for it.
Word has been given out that any one I
who Deueves in the policy of protection ,
as outlined by the voice of the people, will
be welcome in the parade. Although so
snort a time has elapsed since the result
of the great bat;le was known, there will
be rn'any surprises in Saturday's demon
stration. Sever. ii of .Bryan's most ardent
supporters who were on the streets to-day
acknowledged that the great principles of
the Chicago platform were impracticable
, and announced their intention of joining
the majority. While it is not likely that
. the defeated party will move to make it
unanimous, it will be much more unani
mous Saturday than any one would dare
have dreamed of two days ago.
,â  * All kinds of transparencies, turnouts,
clubs and individuals who wish to be in
line and add to (he general demonstra
tion of approval are invited to furnish j
t. eniseives wi.h torches, lish-horns, mv
' sical instruments, drums, artillery, mus
kets, revolwrs and anything and every
thing thai will make a noise, the purpose
being, if possible, to raise such a tumult
as can be heard clear across the bay, ai.d
which the food peopie of San Francisco
are requested to consider in the light of a
r epr mand for allowing the smaller county
to behave so much more nobly and pam
otically than the metropolis of the State.
The bureau for the collection of returns
â  organized by the newspapers of Oakland
â  and San Francisco did splendid work,
â  Â«hich was duly appreciated by the gen
eral public. Every hour a bulletin was
issued showing the fxact count on each
candidate from every precinct in the
county, and this was keut up till a com
plete count wa* recorded early enough to
day to appear in this mornings paper.
Alameda County was the only one in the
b.ate thai furnished complete returns for
fÂ« y !i b . reakfas <- table, and although a
iew outlying precincts Bomewbat aittred
the exact figures, no candidate was affected
thereby.

the following results:

The election machinery of the county
worked to perfection and was conducted
with more dispatch and decorum tuan
was ever known before. The thoughtlul
and intelligent system of liavinj: he re
turns when sealed brought to t' c County
Clerk's office laid out by Cierk Jordan pre
vented any confusion, and was one of the
most romruer.dalue features of the elec
tion. The new great register, which has
been compiled in the County Clerk's office
wit out one dollar of expense to the
county, which job usually costs from
$25,000 to $30,000, was as near perfection
and freer from errors than even the clerk
daied to hope. The ballot clerk and offi
cers of election worked with dispatch, and
in no precinct was more than seven hours
consumed in the raunt, while in many
the work was done in less than half that
time.
'Dome very animated but sood-natured
scenes were witnessed on Broadway to
day. Judge Nusbaumer met John Aubrey
Jonea. Mr. Jones has been talking about
free silver for over two months and has
ma erially lessened the thickness of the
bitumen pavement on several street cor
ners. He has alÂ«o been a most exhaustive
j atron of printer's ink and his corumnni-
Lations have been as long as his stock of
logic was short. Judge Nusbaumer al
ways was a goio. Republican and possesses
the happy faculty of saying what he
means in unadorned Anglo-S ixon. Con
sequently to-day when Mr. Jones intro
iuced into his" language a Latin prase,
which do one understood bat himself,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1896.
Judge Nusbaumer fell back on his stock of
English and in leas than fifteen seconds
he had an audience that would willingly
have paid two bits to hear the same argu
ment advanced in a public hall. Mr.
Jones resented the Judge's remarks that
he (Jones) had been hired by the silver
party to orate on street corners.
"Then I was wrong," shouted Judge
Nusbaumer, "and I take it nil back. I
never meant to convey the impression
that any one ever made the mistake of
hiring you to influence public opinion.
When politicians spend money they want
something in return, "
Mr. Jones walked off, friends led Jndge
Nusbaumer away, and the seance ended.
It was but one of many, but none attracted
so much general attention.
Less of the usual nonsensical election
betting has been recorded this year than
ever before. The only one so far Heard of
is that made by S. W. Montgomery. He
bet Thomas Crow one wheelbarrow ride
from Seventh street to Fourteenth on
Washington that Brvan will cany this
State. Th 6 bet is >o be paid on Saturday
evenme next at 7:30 o'clock, and Mr. Crow
says he feels sure of getting the ri.ie.
The most disappointed people in this
county art those ladies who have worked
for womarn suffrage. Alameda County
certainly did treat the women very un
cavalierly. The vote against it was 12,601,
while only 7943 voters are anxious to see
their wives and sweethearts go with them
to the polls. Mrs. S. C. .Borland said to
day thai although the suffrage amend
ment had not carried in this campaign
it had the effect of showing the men
that one of, their arguments against
allowing women to vote has no founda
tion. The women, she states, have been
able to carry on the campaign with
out neglecting their tamihes and homes,
and have by so doing shown their ability
to take an intelligent part in deciding
matters that come before the electorate
without sacrificing any of those nobler
qualities which belong to woman alone.
The first amendment ralating to the
taxation of moneys* credits, bonds, etc.,
met with no encouracemenj, 12,569 oppos
ing it and only 3022 favoring it. The
amendment which would make it possi
b c to use machines for recording the bal
lot at an elecion was favored by 11,721 and
opposed by 4946.
The third amendment, limiting the lia
bility of stockholders was beaten by a
narrow majority, the figures being 7108 for
and 8976 against. The amendment relat
ing to corporations for municipal pur
poses was opposed by 94U1, while only
4843 favored it.
The fifth amendment relating to muni-
c'pal charters had 9457 supporters and
4722 opponents.
FOUR BLOWS OF FATE,
A Railroad Wreck, a Suicide, a
Train Robbery and a Dis
located Shoulder.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
yuÃ Broadway, November 4. f
Ms. M. E. Richardson, State president
of the W. A. P. A., and Mm. S. M. Martin
returne.l last week from Washington, D.
C, where they had been in attendance
upon the annual session of the Supreme
Council. On the way home they had a
vari -ty of experiences which they are not
likely to forget, but both escaped to ar
rive home.
The first thing to happen was the suicide
of a fellow- passenger in their car. This
caused considerable excitement, but was
buried in a greater mishap. The train
managed to collide with another and
piled the passengers all in a. heap. A few
injuries were soon cared for and all went
merrily along again.
Two days befo c reaching their home
the ladies were greatly excited, with toe
other passengers, when the train was held
up by masked men in Arizona. The news
paper accounts were published last week.
The party was fortunate enough to escape
molestation, and arrived home satisfied
with the trip.
Yesterday, while at work around the
house. Mrs. Richardson fell 'lownstairs
and broke her shoulder, besides other
wise bruising herself. She is confined to
her bed and is mournine the fate that
should carry her through such a trip a3
she has had without injury, to bring her
home and let her fall down a flight of
stairs She has many visitors and spends
her time relating ncr thrilling escapes.
AFTER THE VICTORY
OF PROTECTION
Thinking Men Convinced
That It Saved the
Nation.
What Representative Citizens
Say ol the Election of
McKinley.
BUSINESS WILL NOW KEVIVÂ£.
Mils Are B ing Opned A'ready and
Confidence Has Returned in Many
Channels.
Jake Steppacber, the mysterious assist
ant secretary of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee, entered ibe headquarters
in the Palace Hotel smiling, and the by
standers were amazed.
For the sphinx of the State Committee
to allow that opaque mask, which on the
heads of other men is called a face, to be
tray anything which by the remotest pos
sibility might be construed into an ex
pression of emotion was nothing short of
miraculous.
The ice was thawing. An open sea ex
tended its arras to explorers of the noith
pole. Wherefore, a reporter, marveling
at the miracle, asked Mr. St^ppacher for
his opinion on the result of the election.
Then it was that the mask became rigid
and expressionless and tbe assistant secre
tary, falling limply in his chair, gasped
in horror.
"What!" he almost shrieked. "Ask
me to say anything! Ask me to give an
opinion!" Then he choked and gurgled,
and gazed speechlessly, with his lower
jaw dropped, at his reckless interrogator.
The sphinx was tnmself again, and no
man knew what his thoughts were, save
that those who watched him from ambush
saw that ho chuckled to himseii after the
style of Mark Hanna as he bent over his
desk.
Major McLauehlin wore a broad smile.
He bad worked like a stoker on the trial
trip of a fleet cruiser for more than four
months, and his work had crystallized
into victory in spite of all obstacles.
Every one who came in shook him by the
hand and congratulated him and his asso
ciates on the splendid work they had
done for Republicanism in this Slate.
Colonel D. M. Higgins, his faithful and
untiring coadjutor, beamed through his
glasses upon Judge Waymire and Judge
R. B. Carpenter. His heart was almost
too full for utterance, and he contented
himself by shaking hands wit i all the
happy Republicans in the room.
"I expected ihat we would do better in
San Francisco," said Theodore Re.chert,
"but the State has done very we.l, never
theless. This settles the Democratic party,
I think. It was its last struggle in the
last ditch."
Judije R. B. Carpenter remarked that he
was not all surprised at the outcome of the
election. The people of the United States
were not blanked fools all the time.
Judge J. P. R.ordan was elated, but he
was a littio prejbeupied as to a few thou
sand dollars that he expected to win on
McKinley carrying ttiis City and the State.
Hilarity prevailed at the room* of the
Republican County Committee at 850 Mar
ket street. Notwithstanding whatever re
verses they might have sustained on the
local ticket they were pleased to ob-erve
that the psirty wreckers, the Kelly-Ma
honey clique, were trailing along in the
mud away in the rear <>t the procession.
"Now there will be a revival of business
in hhipping circes," said Donald
Ross of Ross & Hewlett when talk
in: about the election yesterday.
"With McKinley and protection we
can now go ahead and do some
thing. This has been the busiest day w>>
have had in six months. Why, man, it is
only a few minutes ago since we Â«ot an
order for twenty-five kegs ol butter that
would never have come our way had
Bryan been elected.
"McKinley's election means the open
ing up of five lumber-mills and the haul
ing out of Oakland Creek of half a doeen
Ve.-sels that I know of. One of our best
known lumbermen told me to-day that he
and his confreres had just held a meeting
and decided to start operations at once.
They own two mills, one of which is idle
and one has been running half time, and
are the agents for three other mills, only
one o: which iias b.-en running, and that
one only half time. Now every one of
them is to be put on full time and one
schooner will be out of the creek to-mor
row to load provisions.
"While discussing the situation I made
the remark thiit the mills would require
provisioning. It was then the order lor
the butter was given; so you see that not
only the loggers and sawyers w.!l benefit,
but also the entire mercantile community.
I teil you business is on the mend and we
will bare few idle men this wintor."
"Our next President is already making
himself felt in bu-mess circles," said
Captain Grey, superintendent o. the Ship
owners' nnd Merchants' Towboai Com
pany. " IJie mills are being opened up,
and we iiwe a number of .rders to bring
vessels out of the creeit that have oeen
tied up for months. Ttie shipping indus
try is bound to improve, and the sooner
the better. We hove had a season of hard
times, now we will s>-e how tiie country
will pick up under McKinley aud pro
tection."
"McKinley can't get into office fast
enough to suit me," said Captain Hawley,
superintendent of the Spreckels TowDoat
Company. "It means a new lease of life
for the water front, and, God knows, ive
want it. Business has been going from
bad to worse until now Oakland Creek is
crowded with coasters that cannot make a
living. Now I hope to see them all hauled
out ot the mud and fixed up for business
once more. That would oiean employ
ment for hundreds of men. and conse
quently there will be less distress this win
ter than for j r ears past. McKinley's term
of office will be a good one for the work
ingmen."
Judge McKenna â The principles advo
cated by Bryan could not be accepted by
the American people without sacrificing
all that they have ever held t > be dear to
them. lam not at all surprised at the
result of the election. idai it been other
wise I should have been immeasurably
shocked at the deterioration of American
manhood. I made my last campaign on
the silver issue, aud though the sentiment
has prowii here I was always satisfied
that it would never be accepted by the
people at largeâ that is those wno con-
Mder such matters from a meritorious
btandooint. Now tbat the vexed question
is settled, for a time at least, I look for an
era of prosp-rity, the like of which the
country has not seen lor twenty years.
Edward W\ Williams, clerk of the Jus
tices' Court, said that he saw in the Mc-
Kinley landslide a sure sign of returning
prosperity to the United States.
"In the face of the uncertainty that has
prevailed fur some time past regarding
safety of investments." he said, "people

lions on millions are locked up awaiting
a favorable opportunity to pat It into
trpde. The people of thi9 country have
confidence in ihe Republican p.trty and
will be willing to unlocK their wealth now
that its victory is assured. "
Major McLaughiin was bqt>> pleased
and fatigued la?t night. During the past
few weeks he fought the hardest battle of
his life, rendered all the more difficult
perhaps becau-e the incentive of s-elfish
ambition was absent, he not being a can
didate for office or preferment.
Wnen the executive committee of
twenty-one of the State Central Commit
tee first took up the work .n this State the
task was absolutely hopelegs. The strong
People's party vote and the fusion of that
party with the Democrats composed a
most formidable force, an apparently im
pregnable line of battle, but Major Me-
Laughl n is a fighter and determined to
make the battle of his life, even though
he should die in the castle moat. He and
Colonel Higgins took charge of the attack,
and their friends wept when they saw
those two rash meu storming the heights.
"I must have bet n congratulated by a
thousand people to-day," "said the major
last night; "people of all conditions in
the social and financial world, from the
bootblack to the millionaire, they have
been shaking bauds with me and con
gratulating me on ihe splendid victory
achieved for Major McKinley in Cali
fornia.
"When we entered upon the campaign
it was a bopelesf case. Our party seemed
to be torn to pieces in this State; there
were factions in the State and factions In
this City. The two enemies of sound and
conservative government and of true
Americanism were united aeaiust as. We
plu:i ed into the very front of the con
test, and we fought a fight that has never
been equaled in the history of America.
"I took hold of this matter as a business
man and in a businesslike way. Forevery
dollar expended I tried to get ten. I de
voted my whole time to the cause, and
Colonel Higgins and Mr. Steppacher did
the same.
"I have had the hearty co-operation of
the business portion of the community in
this matter, and no man bus been of more
assistance to me than has John D. Spreck
els, and I will say that whenever 1 had oc
casion to ca.l upon him for advice or as
sistance it was never in vain. I want to
say of him also that he neverattempted to
dictate to the committee or to induce it to
further any local political schemes. I
have found him to be an honest, upright
man, a loyal and unselfish Republican
and a true patriot."
One of the men most thoroughly ac
quainted with the business of banking
and the commercial interests of this
county in general is B. A. Becker, the
president of the German Savings and
L< an Society, lv an interview yesterday
he said:
"Pt-ople were afraid that if they put
their money into savings banks under free
coinageâ that is, if they put gold into the
bunks â they would buy up silver in
Mexico, China and other countries and
pay tneir deposits in silver. A3 silver
under free coinage would be equal to only
53 cents in the dollar they would get only
half their money back.
"We argued with them, and explained
that although free coinage would veal the
commercial interests of the country a
heavy blow, here in California savines
bangs depositors would be protected by
the specific contract laws Talking, how
ever, produced no definite result.
"The effect ol McKiuley's election has
been most beneficial already. Only one
day has passed, yet business is fast re
viving.
"It is my belief that we are now enter
ing on ah era of prosperity that will be
wonderful when contrasted with the con
dit.ons under which we have labored for
the last four years. It is all due to the
election of McKinley."
"My voice has been for McKinley and
protection first, last and alt the time,"
said Harbor Commissioner Da T. Cole.
"I cannot imagine any greater calamity
lefalling this country than the election
of Mr. Bryan. Now we may expect a
measurable amount of prosperity right
away. One thing is certain, a revival in
business circles has begun and arrange
ments have been made to start up a num
ber of industries at once."
Andrea Sbarboro was quite enthusiastic
over me election of McKinley. HÂ« said:
"The fourteenth ann .al meeting of trie
San Francisco Mutual Building and Loan
Association was held yesterday. The
board of directors made an address to the
shareholders in which they state that the
election of McKinley will have a bene
ficial effect on buiiding and loan associa
tions by giving steady employment to
wage-earners and thus enabling them to
pay tl:eir dues promptly and acquire
homes for their families.
"I think that the workingmen have
demonstrated their ability to help govern
the Republic. While it might be thought
that the masses of laboring people mieht
tend to social anarchy, on the contrary it
shows their conservatism, their hijrh in
telligence and their remarkable ability
for self government."
The common talk in financial circles
yesterday was that the sum of $4u,000 or
thereabouts lutd been withdrawn during
the day from the California Safety De
posit, to be invested at once. It was ail
caused, according to report, by the eiec
tion of McKinley and the increased con
fidence resulting therelrom in the finan
cial world.
J. Dalzcll Brown, secretary and treis
uier o! the Safety Deposit Company veri
fied the report in a large degree.
"Wi-.ile we have no method of ascertain
ing the amount withdrawn by our pa
trons" he suid, "the rujih. of business to
day has almost no precedent.
"My belief is that large sums are being
withdrawn owing wholly to the fact that
depositors are not now afraid to maKe iu
veÂ«tments.
"Many business men who have had
thefr money withdrawn from the banks
for some time in conversation witti me to
day stated that they would place their
muney in the banks aL'ain. It is all dae
to the election of McKinley."
Chief Crowley said that McKinley's elec
tion meiint open mills and not open
mint?. It would give such an impetus to
business that the country would soon feel
the beneficial results and labor and capital
would enjoy the. fruits of prosperity.
"I felt confident," said the Cfiief, "that
the intelligence of the voters throughout
the country would not carry them away
from the real issue at sttike and that pro
tection would triumph."
"McKinley's election," said Captain
Wittman, "will be one of the best things
that ever happened tdis country. I fore
saw that he would make a clean sweep
after my recent visit to the East, where I
saw ail the great factories end gigantic
industries paralyzed by frie trade. |
"Protection to our industries means
prosperity; it means renewed confidence;
it means that money will be easier, aud
that capitalists will be ready and willing
to invest it. It is my opinion that we will
so jii see a boom in the country that has
Tiever been witnessed before."
Captain Lees was greatly pleased at the
result of Uie Presidential election. "I
never had any doubt," said the captain,
"that McKinley wwnld be elected, and I
am surprised that his vote has been so
small in this City. My lowest estimate
was that his majority would be 5000. The
result has been a disappointment to me.
"McKinley's election will be of the
greatest b nefit to the country in every
way; of that I feel assured."

RACES ATTRACTED
THE FAIR SEX
Thousands of Ladies View
Some Great Sport
at Ingleside.
Favorites Were Toppled Over
and Tips Were in High
Demand.
SPEEDY WHEEL OF FOETUNE
Tcok the Handicap in Fast Tims.
Hermanita First at Oids of 15
to Iâ J 0 C in Form Again.
The fair sex did not forzet that yester
day was "Ladies' day" at Ingleside track.
Elderly and sedate matrons, fair young
Misses and mothers with their children to
the extent of 3000 took advantage of the
free gate and beautiful weather, filling the
big grand stand until the Royal Hawaiian
band almost imagined it was lost in a
mystic maze; or, more strictly speaking,
a maze of California's beautiful women.
And the Islanders furnished a musical
programme that delighted all.
The male population, apparently fully
satisfied as to the result of the election,
also turned out in large numbers, until it
almost seemed a holiday crowd. Nor was
the clubhouse deserted, for a number of
ladies and their escorts viewed the finishes
from its balconies.
Tbe racing card was one of the best yet j
furnished at the meeting. Six events j
were run off, of which number favorites |
captured but two, so th? picking was quite i
spicy and interesting. Eddie Jones was ,
at the top of the jockey heap again, scor- j
me winning brackets twice. No big plung- j
ing was done in the betting ring, but |
everybody seemed to want to put a bet j
down, and the p!uy suited the eleven j
layers of odds unanimously.
The first turn-over happened in tho
opening race of the day, a selling affair for
two-year-olds at five furlongs. George j
Rose's Geyser, who was practically un
beatable at the recent State Fair meet at
Sajcramento, was well backed to turn the
trick at odds of 1 to 5. Afflicted with
much more speed, the second choice, j
Scotch Rose, always had the footing over
him and won easily by three parts of a
length. Philip H was third, behind the
favorite.
Somewhat reduced financially the crowd
sought to recoup on Bueno in the ext
event, a seven-furlong run with a field of
nine starting. Opening in the betting at
pvens the black horse was backed down to
7to 10. Jumbled about soon after the I
start he cut a very sorry figure in the run- I
ning, tumbling into last position and about j
holding his own to the wire. The 40 to 1 i
shot Walter J, with 113 up, led the field
until well into the stretch, when he beÂ»:an
tiring and lell back. Benamela and
Encino then looked like the contending j
horses when Heimanita. a 15 to 1 out
sider, came like a rocket and beat Bena
mela out a neck quite handily.
Encino, who ran a surprisingly good
race, was n close third.
Wheel of Fortune, the handsome (laugh- I
ter of Gano, was in good form yesterday i
and no mistake. The bandicapper, v a
spirit of liberality, tossed her into the
mile and seventy-yard handicap at I(X>
pounds and said, "'Let her go, Gallagher." i
Going to the post 7 to 10, she jollied~along I
behind Nebuchadnezzar, mo had 104 1
pounds up, until the paddock was almost j
reached, when she left nim and passed the
judges, eased up, in 1:45! >. Wawona,
Marcel and Coda, behind "Nebby," fol
lowed later.
Hard luck befell Midlo, the even-money
choice in the six-furlong sprint that fol- j
lowed. Jostled about as the barrier went j
up, he lost tnree or four lengths and fin
ished third. The 14 to 5 second choice
Caliente made ali the running, finishing
nearly ali out, three parts of a length be
fore Ostler Joe, who was coming fast. Al- j
varado would not line up and was left.
There were but five starters in the mile I

the horses out, and after a brush at the
head of the straight-for-home v with Gov
ernor Budd took the purse from Mat |
Storn's novice at the game, with little in
reserve. But j O C met disaster at the
first jump, and Manford performed a very
graceful somersault, taking the lust ob
stacle. Neither rider was injured.
The Corrigua entry, Can't Dance, and
Ezell's Ranardine absorbed most of the
atention in the betting on the final race of
tho day, a six-furlong sprint with eight
eoing to the post, llanardine, who closed

THE SAN FtlAlS CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1896.
CYCLER WELLS RETURNS
Back From a Successful Season
on the Eastern Racing
Circuit.
He Is Matched to Race Walter Foster
at the New Ye odrome Track
Novembar 21.
Charles S. Wells, the crack California
riaer, arrived in the City yesterday, after
a long season on the Eastern racing cir-'
cuit. He was accompanied by K. P.
Aylward, his trainer, and the trainer of
Otto Ziegler Jr. Zieglercame to the State
with there, but stopped at Wells' home at
Pleasanton for a few days' rest. He broke
his arm a month ago at Trenton, N. J.,
and has not yet taken it out of the cast.
He will arrive here Sunday, and go to his
home at San Jose Monday.
Wells an-l Aylward visited their fellow
members of the Bay City Wheelmen last j
ni^ht, and recounted their successes and i
experiences in the East. All tbe Califor- j
nia riders did fairly well there, and have j
made considerable money. Aylward says j
none of the Eastern cracks will be here
until February, when Bald, Cooper and
several others will surely come. McFar- ;
iand is now in Texas, and will be here
about December 1. Arthur Gardiner will
pass through here on the 12th of this
month en route to Australia.
Weiis and Aylward visited the new i
velodrome track yesterday afternoon. |
They say it is one of th .â¢ fastest and best |
in the country. Wells yesterday signed I
an agreement to race Walter F. Foster of
the Olympic Cluo Wheelmen there on
November 21. There will be three match
nice?, at one. two and iive miles, paced.
They will go to San Jose this morning and
Wells will go into training, at once. He
feels confident of whining.
Aylward says Bald shouid beat Cooper
when they meet to decide the world's
championship at Nashville and Memphis
this month. He also thinks Z m,merman
would be outclassed now if he returned to I
racing.
Zlegler will probably not ride on the
i coast, but will rest the entire winter, pre- I
paraiorv to next year on the circuit.
Wiil Knir>penD?rj.', captain of the Los '
Angeles Athletic Clul>, and a well-known i
wheelman of the south, arrived here yes- {
, terday. He is very popular with the rid
-1 ers here, having been the manager of one !
of the largest racing teams on the coast ;
las t year.
Emii Ulbrecht, a speedy Los Angeles
professional, is in the City on a visit."
There is trouble Jn the Imperial Cycling
Club over politics, and it was stated last
niÂ«ht that the president, vice-president
and quite a number of the members had
resigned.

j ager of Bob Fitzsirnmons, that the great
! fighter and his retinue will arrive this
â  evening on the overland train.
Baker and Hickey, the sparring part
ners of the Cornishman, are journeying
westward. In all probability Fitzsimmons
will make the BaUl win Hotel his tempo
rary headquarters. Manager Groom can
not say definitely where the great tighter
will train, but some of Fiizsimruons' near
friends contend that lie will select old
Barney Farley's rendezvous.
Sharkey has been in training at the Seal
Pwock House for a week or more, and, ac- '
cording to his trainer?, he will give a cooi
I account of himseif on the evening of De

where the tight will take place.
iJan Creedon is expected to arrive to

him home "an honest dollar."

contest will be held on the evening of the
18th inst. Both men are training hard.

MANY FREAK BETS
OK THE ELECTION
A Man Loses His Whiskers,
Another Must Wheel
the Winner.
A Fish Market Has Bryan's Bier
on Exhibition and Attracts
a Crowd.
OTHER FREAKS TO HEAR FROM
Enough OJd Bets to Make a Big Show
if They Were Piacel Uader
One Canopy.
There were many freak bets on the elec
tion. One man loses his whiskers and
another agreed to wheel hiMfriend ;n; n a
wheelbarrow from the ferries to Tenth
street.
The unique features of the late Demo
cratic disaster are now coming into notice
and nothing is more amusing than the
fieakish bets that some people' 3 exuber
ance led them to make on the outcome.
Returns are not yet in from the great
border-land region that lies between san
ity and insanity, where men agree to let
their hair grow for ten years if so and so
wins or loses this or that office, nor have
the fat men who agreed to fast for forty
days if Bryan were beaten been seen, but
news of several marvelous bets has come
to the notice of The Call.
John Hadley of 690)4 KlliÃ street wears
a long, flowing beard, which has been his
pride for nearly a quarter of a century.
His patriarchal appearance has long made
him a conspicuous tigure and bis beard
has been the wonder that has amazed the
children for many blocks around. Hut it
John Hadley 13 a man of his word his
heard must come off within live days after
Chairrran Jon?s concedes Bryan's defeat,
for such w:ts the tenor of a bet he made
with Henry Anson, who now goes clean
shaven, ar.U who agreed never to shave
again should McKiniey be defeated. Had
ley must go one whole year without his
beard. If ue then craves its return he
will probably not live long enough for it
to reach its present length. His friends
believe he will ony back the privilege of
wearing his whiskers, and it is believed
Anson will charge iiim a good sum for
sizning a release troni the obligation.
Tbe following is the copy of a wheel
barrow bet made by two well-known men,
whose confidence was as great as that of
Fred Becker of Oakland, who roasted
psaoata and sold them 011 the street all
day when Cleveland was defeated.
Welch will wheel Kiit>stein from the
ferries to Tenth street on November 15 as
per the terms of the following agreement:
San l'>. ax cisco, Nov. 2, 1896.
We, tbe undersigned, do iienby agree as lol
lows, to wit:
I, J. C. Welch, do agree that In the event of
Mr. McKiniey being elected to the Presidency
of the United Stales i wih wheel William
Klipstein In a wheelbarrow lrom the lorry,

I, William Kllpstelu, do agree thai in the
event of Mr. Bryan's election to the Presidency
of the Lnited States 1 will wheel J. C. Welch in
a wheelbarrow Ircm the lerry, foot of Murket

Witnesses: Frank Tkai>or,

A unique feature of the after-election
freaks was on exhibition all day yesterday
at the San Francisco Fish Market on Clay
street, where a rude coffin for Bryan
stood in plain view all day, surrounded
with burning tapers. Above it was the
followiug legend on a placard:
: I'oor little WIMe Bryan lies within. :
: Tbe funeral process.ou will start for :
: Salt Kiver at 2P.x. on Saturday. ;
The floral offerings were numerous, con
sisting chiefly of celery tops and cabbage
leaves, contriDuted by joylul Republicans,
while over the rough bier were innumera
ble toy roosters, with combs of cardinal
red and long gaffs of cruel steel. Hun
dreds of people viewed the weird specta
cle from early morning until dusk.
STILL ALL IN THE SWIM

Recordâ The Ball Pool Tour
nament.

Stolle now holds the American cham
pionship for a mile, iÂ»aif and quarter

straightaway record, and he made it in a
tank.
W. B. Littlefield took the prize for plain
diving; W. P. Healey second.
Melrose and Cornell swam a draw in
tbe 100-yard race, in 1:14.

.. THE FEENCH BOY.
He Seems Childish Compared With His
English and American Cousin.
Our boys do not take the social polish
until much later. I have heard Amei>
cans express surprise at the childishness
of bis: boys .. whom they saw playing at
marbles or with tops at an age when their
boys play football. It is because these
boys allow themselves to be watched, re-
strained and reprimanded by timid
mothers much longer than theirs, ana the
boys themselves are not generally inclined
to .the daring undertakings thar tempt
young Americans. Their affection for
Robinson Crusoe" is Very Platonic; they
do not long to run away to sea, nor even
to get on the roof to learn their lesson*,
like a little fellow I .met in the country
out West while visitine his parents, and
who, when I expressed my surprise at his
perch, said, "Well, if I slip, I can, hold on
to the chimney by my legs!" , '
' And saying this he made tha gesture of
clasping the Dig chimney between his bare
and extremely short legs, more scratched
than words can tell, under* their short
knickerbocKers. . Our boys are evidently
girlish in comparison. - .
On the other hand a French youth of 18
is stupefied on making the acquaintance of
English or American youths ut':his age to
meet with something that ; seems to him
another kind of childishness; 1 mean that
boyishness which, up to a certain point,
lasts for life in all Anglo-Saxons. He
finds himself much more of a man/ because
he really has a greater 'intellectual fund,
more general information, a more highly
developed sj critical sense, a \ riper Âi mind
already; much â :â¢ refined^,'and: quite enfran-
chised from the simple instruction given
at the lycee.âl'h.Bentzon in the Century. ;

CARICATURED ON
A CLOTH SCREEN
Woman Suffragists Are
Grossly Ridiculed by
the "Chronicle."
Advice Io Voters to Oppose the
Sixth Amendment Fre
ceded.
LADIES WERE MUCH AMAZED
And Indignant Over the Unexpected
Course ot a Paper in Which
Some Had Trusted.
"There is not a California woman who
respects herself who will permit the
Chronicle to be brought into tier home
again."
The speaker vra3 Miss Susan B. An
thony. She had a good reason for making
the foregoing statement. Miss Anthony
has devoted many years to the cause of
woman suffrage. Kesolute in purpose,
despite her many years she has during
the past few weeks toured California up
and down, cast and west, riding on stages
and cars, campaigning in the open air and
in halls and from car platforms. She has,
in fact, devoted eight months continu
ously, with other ladies prominent in tbe
National organization, to working zeal
ously for the woman-suffrage cause.
Two weeks ngo- yes, one week ago â the
ladies connected with the National organ
ization felt confident, from letters, inter
views and from personal observations
made during their journeyings through
tne State, that the outcome of the election
would be the investment of the women of
the State with the ballot. They had
counted on the friendly attitude of the
daily papers which have subscribers in
thousands of homes, and were especially
encouraged by the strong position taken
by The Call in favor of the cause of
woman suffrage, to which ft has consist
ently and steuilily adhered, and particu
larly by the action of the Republican
btate Central Committee.
The surprise of the thousands of ladies
enlisted in the cause can hardly be imag
ined when on Monday of the present week
and again on Tuesday, the repetition show
ing that the Chronicle had adopted that
course deliberately, there appeared in
large and conspicuous black type in the
Chronicle advice to all voters to oppose
the sixth amendment to the constitution.
"Vote no" said the Chronicle on Monday
ami agtiin on Tuesday, and this advice
was scattered about the State as much as
the circulation of the paper would permit,
so that all the harm j\ras done that the
Chronicle was capable of doing.
The ladies took the matter much to
heart. So did their brothers, fathers and
husbands and friends generally. Hardly
had the edition of the Chronicle of Mon
day been passed from hand to hand at the
breakfast tables and commented upon in
offices and other places of business when
an indignation meeting was under way in
every place where woman suffragists re
side. The publication on Tuesday in
creased this indignation very perceptibly
and had a disastrous effect upon the cir
culation of the offensive sheet. For many
hours the business office had all it could
do marking up "stops" on the subscrip
tion list Ladies visited the Chronicle
office and gave their address and left no
question remaining in the minds of the
business office force concerning their mo
tive. They explained clearly and with
emphasis that they could no longer patron
ize or encourage a paper which would take
such a course.
But this was not all. When the stereop
ticon man who threw pictures on a screen
in front of the Chronicle office Tuesday
night, while the Chronicle was waiting to
get out some figures concerning the elec
tion, got in his work, there was supplied
to him from the Chronicle office a par
ticularly malicious "slide" upon which
every woman who favors woman suffrage,
and also every voter who believes in giv
ing the vote to women, was held up to
ridicule before a crowd of large size. This
slide represented a virago of Amazonian
proportions menacing a very small and
woe-begone man with a stick or club. Un
derneath the picture, as it appeared on
the screen were the words, "This is the
kind of man who votes for woman suf
frage."
The intent was plain. The purpose of
the Chronicle was to make it appear that
the ladies were engaged in bulldozing
voters, and when this news was spread the
resentment of the ladies increased. Theso
facts furnish the reason for Miss Susan B.
Anthony's utterance.
"There is not a California woman who
respects herself who will permit the
Chronicle to be brought into her home
again."
Miss Anthony had heard about the car
icature with wnich the Cironicle, at the
close of a campaign hard fought by tbe
woman suffragists, had seen tit to add
gratuitous insult to gratuitous injury, and
she seemed to be fairly amazed, for that
was the first insult that had been offered
to the ladies. The public manner in
which it was offered only emphasized tbe
intent back of it.
Rev. Anna Shaw was not less outspoken
than Miss Anthony. "I consider that the
action of tne Chronicle," said Miss Shaw,
MEW TO-DAT.
COVERED
; WITH
HUMOR
"When I was thirteen years old I began to hava
â¢ore eyes and ears, and from my ears a humor
spread. I doctored with five different skilful

deliberately and after due thought, "was,
to say the least, contemptible. The
Chronicle not only marked the ballot
which il printed so that voters might be
persuaded to vote acainst the sixth
amendment, but also urged the voters on
the day of election to oppose it. That was
done at a time which loft us no chance to
counteract its influence."
This is tke opinion of one of the bright
est of women and one oi the best informed
of woman suffragists.
"The hope we have in this State," Miss
Shaw continued, "is that the constitu
tional amendment will be immediately
resubmitted and then the movement may
be carried to victory in the next two
years."
Miss Anthony said also that the woman
snffrage work will not be suspended, but
will go on with vigor. "We have had a
magnificent and dignified campaign in
this State. The work has developed some
splendid, practical women who will labor
for the cause. A committee will be ap
pointed to go to Sacramento during the
session of the Legislature and prepare
resolutions to be submitted once more.
Tiiere are now woman suffrage clubi in
most of the precincts throughout the
State, and they will devote two years to
systematic work amonc the voters."
Even such dastardly work as the
Chronicle has been guilty of will not dis
courage the ladies, as these interviews
show plainly.
Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw were not I
alone yesterday by any means in con
demning the Clfronicle's course. One '
lady, who is noted as one of the most ac
tive and effective of the leaders, said:
"The women of California will remem
ber the Chronicle. Those who are true
and loyal to the cause, after what has hap
pened, will cease to patronize it in any
way. On the other hand The Cam, took
up woman suffrage early, when it was less
popular in the State, and on election day
It gave us a tine editorial, which we
especially noticed. Tlie women of Cali
fornia should rally as one woman to stand
by the paper that has stood by them."
This evening a reception will be held
by the Woman Suffragists in Golden (jate
Hall. To-day the annual convention of
the State Woman Suffrage Association
will come together in Golden Gate Hall,
the first session being held at 2:30 p. m.
Two sessions will also be held to-morrow,
at 10 a. M. and 2:30 p. m. The headquar
ters of the delegates will be at the Berk
shire Hotel. The action of the Chronicle
has created so much resentment that it
may come up for difceussion by resolution.
POISONED BY MORPHINE.
Edward Durrell Thought He
Was Swallowing a Dose
of Antipyrine.
Ke Blames a Drug Clerk for the Mis
take, but the Latter Indig
nantly Denies It.
Edward Durrell, a painter living at 605
Pine street, was taker, to the Receiving
Hospital last night suffering lrom mor
phine poisoning.
He said he was suffering from a head
ache, and went to Simpson's drugstore,
603 Montgomery street. He asked the
clerK to give him a dose of antipyrine.
The clerk gave him a dose and he swal
lowed it. He had not walked far when he
began to feel queer. He returned to the
store and told the clerk he was not feeling
well. The clerk asked him if he bad swal
lowed the stufF he gave him, and receiv
ing a reply in the affirmative the clerk
told him it was morphine, and rang for
the patrol wagon.
Dr. Stice applied the usual remedies
and Durrell was soon pronounced out ol
danger.
The drug clerk, who refused to give his
name, denied that Durrell got any med
icine whatever from him.
"The man came into the store," he said,
"about 6:30 o'clock. He told me he was
not feeling well and I advised him to go
to the Receiving Hospital. He appeared
to be suffering from nicotine poij-oning.
He said be would go to the hospital and
I rang for the patrol wagon.
"The man was only once in the store. It
is not true that he asked me for anti
pyrine or anything else. He got nothing
from me, and I cannot understand why
he should make such a statement, as it is
not true. I don't want to have my name
mentioned, as I had nothing to do with
the man except to do him a kindness by
ringing lor the patrol wagon."

THE SAN FKAJSTCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1896.
DEMOCRATS CLING
TO THEIR HOPES
Cheerful Under the Most
Discouraging Cir
cumstances.
California Claimed for Bryan,
"With Indiana and Michi
gan Doubtful."
ALFORD AND TROY HOLD OUT.
Governor Budd and J J. Dwyer Not
So Conn" lentâ Governor Smith
Giv s His Views.
was a more buoyant feeling
â among the Bryan men at the Democratic
l^-'tate campaign headquarters in ttie Cali
iornia Hotel last night. Many of them
appeared to think that Mr. Bryan had a
chance to till the Presidential chair, not
wiibstanding the discouraging reports
thftt were received by the newspapers.
The figures of Senator Jones of the
Democratic National Committee, by which
he convinced himself that Mr. Bryan had
a fighting chance, seemed to impress the
Democrats, Silverites and Populists of
California to a degree beyond the under
standing of ordinary mortals.
Relying on Senator Jones' statistic?.
Chairman Alford of the Democratic State
Campaign Committee declined to express
an opinion in regard to the causes that
tended to the defeat of Mr. Bryan. He
said he bad to be fully convinced of Mr.
McKinley's election before he would be
willing to discuss the causes that led up to
such a result.
R. P. Troy, secretary of the committee,
said:
We would like to have the public under
stand thut we do not concede California to
McKinley. On the contrary, we believe that
it nas gone for Bryan by 7000 plurality. It
Rrytin has carried Indiana and Michigan, as
we have reÃsou to believe, notwithstanding
the reports first sent over the wires, witn the
help of Caliiornia he will win. That is why
we are feeling so hopeful to-night.
Hon. J. J. Dwyer, California's represen
tative on the Democratic iSational Com
mittee, also felt that there was still a
slight hope for Mr. Bryan, though he ad
mitted that the prospect was not so bright
as he could wisii. He was willing to dis
cuss the matter on the hypothesis that the
sage of Canton is elected. Mr. Dwyer
s-aiil :
If Mr. Bryan is defeated it is due to a num
ber of causes. In the first place it is too much
to expect a great and radical change in the
financial views of the people to be accom
plished in a campaign of three months.
The Republicans were just as enthusiastic
for John C. Fremont in 185G as the Democrats
have been lor Bryan this time. The Republi
cans were defeated as completely as the Demo
-1 crais are said to be now, yet four years later
: they swept thecountrv.
I expect history to repeat Itself, and that
with Bryan as the standard-bearer four years
hence the Democrats will cirry the day as the
Republicans did with Lincoin.
The array of forces opposed to Mr. Bryan
j was the most formldabc this generation has
seen. The aggregated wealth of the country
and the enormous influence of most of the
great newspapers that were formerly consid
ered Democratic had to be met No doubt iour
years from now the places ot huch journals
will bs supplied by newspapers that are gen
j uinely Democratic.
The tide in favor of the Republicans coming
| from the result of the last election had to be
stemmed. The nard times were against Mr.
Bryan. Then he suffered from ihe odium oi
being compelled to criticize his own party ad
ministration as at present carried on, which
was undeniably a heavy load of itself.
In view of all the circumstances the general
result of the campnien haÂ« sa iÂ«fied me that
the Democratic party was all right on all the
principal issues, and that no mistake whs
i:iade In choosing Mr. Bryan as tne standard
t besrer.
With any other nominee we would not have
done half so well. No other man in the Demo
cratic party compares with Bryan in intel
lectual power, stalvÂ»artneÂ»s of character, cour
age, or that magnetism Â«vithout which a man
who relies on agitation as his only weapon to
accomplish a great reform cannot succeed.
Jn the history of this country there has been
nobody to compare with Mr. Bryan as a popu-
I lar agitator and lender, except Wendell
j Phillips and William Lloyd Garrison, and Mr
Bryan seems to combine the best and strongest
qualities oi both.
I look to see Mr. Bryan the candidate of the
Democratic party four years hence, and I con
fidently expect his election at that time, with
75 per cent of the American people behind
him.
Hon. Robert B. Smith, Governor-elect
of Montana, who remained in California
to work for Mr. Bryan because he felt that
his vote was not needed in Montana to
secure his own success, was gratified to
learn that he was 20,000 ahead of his most

formidable opponent. He said he would
have been glad to spare a few of those
votea to help the National ticket in Cali
fornia. Governor Smith said:
In my opinion this election was decided on
the money question, no matter which way it
has gone. " The tariff cut a very small figure in
the fight. If the election has gone In favor of
McKinloy it has been carried by men who are
in business, who pretended to be for Bryan
while talking on the streets, but who in tne
polling booth voted for McKinley. They were
scared on account of the cry about the 50-cent
dollar hurting their business. I think their
scare was not well founded, but it had the
effect of taking them over to McKinley.
X think there were Â» great many of such
men who were trying to hold their allegiance
io the Democratic party in name, but who
went with the Republicans la making out
their votes.
It is apparent to me that the laboring men
of San Francisco supported McKinley loyally.
Whatever may have bÂ°en the sentiment or
the cause that led them to take that course
there can be no dispute as to how their votes
were cast. The result speaks for itself.
When Governor Budd appeared at the
Democratic headquarters he was heartily
greeted, for it is considered by Mr. Alford,
Mr. Troy and other members of the com
mittee that the Governor's speeches in
this City had a material effect on the local
result. In proof of this they point to the
fact that the Republicans were claiming
Francisco by 10,000 majority, and the
cutting of this down to less than 500 they
attribute in great measure to the Gov
ernor's personal efforts.
A member of the committee said that D.
S. Dorn, a well-known Republican politi
cian, had expressed an opinion that if
Governor Budd had kept out of the light
in this City it would have given a plural
ity of not less than 7000 for McKinley.
It is believed that the bitter attacks on
the Governor by some of his enemies
stirred him up and caused him to make a
more active canvass than he otherwise
would have done. He spoKe as many as
three times a night on several occasions.
When asked wha^ he had to say about
the result, Governor Budd replied:
If Mr. McKinley is elected he is my President
for four years, but at the next election I am
for Mr. Bryan again, and I believe he will be a
winner.

A FAMILY ROW.

Beer-Bottle by Hit Son.
James Allen, an old roan living at 2
Illinois street, had a family row last nipht

He was bathing one of his feet, which
