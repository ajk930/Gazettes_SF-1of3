Down His Long-Ex
pected Decision.
EXISTING GRAIN RATES

VIEWS OF THE PARTIES TO THE
CONTROVERSY.
Final Trial of the Question of What Are Rea
sonable Rates Yet to Come â Com
missioners to Confer To-
Morrow.
Two important points stand oat prom- :
inently in the , decision rendered by
Judge Joseph.' McKenna of 'the United
States Circuit Court yesterday in the
case of the Southern Pacific Company
against the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners' of the State of California.
The proposed reduction of 8 per cent
in the grain rates of the complainant j
are declared to be itrjust and 'unrea- j
sonable, and the constitutionality of
the commission is sustained. - -'
It is now more ; than , fourteen months
since the- suit was -Instituted. asking the
court to enjoin the commission from , en
forcing; the reduced grain rates arid from
making further reductions '< to the extent
of 25 per cent, as' outlined in a resolution ;
adopted by. the board.
Pending the hearing of the case proper
a temporary injunction was granted. Affi
davits - were subsequently riled and argu- !
ments made thereon looking to the disso
lution on the part of the commission of
this restraining order, and the decision of
Judge McKenna relates simply to this
temporary injunction. The main issue as
to the reasonableness or unreasonableness
of the proposed 8 â  per cent redaction re
mains yet to be determined.
Many side issues were brought into the
case, but the most important of these were
set aside by the court as not being perti
nent or necessary to the consideration of
the main questions in controversy.
It was 11 o'clock to tbe minute when
Judge McKenna began the reading of his
long-expected and anxiously looked-for
decision. ' The courtroom was crowded
with a brilliant array of legal ; talent.
Prominent among those present were:
Governor Budd, Attorney-General Fitz
gerald, Rjbert Y. Hayne, J. E. Foulds,
John Garber, Chairman H. M. La Rue of
the Railroad Commission, Henry N.
Clement, R. T. Clement, Thomas J. Clu
nie, Andrew J. Clunie. Marshal Barry
â  Baldwin, United States District Attorney
Foote and his assistant, Mr. Knight. , â¢
Shortly after the Judge began to deleter
his decision he espied the Governor within
the inclosure reserved for members of the
bar and invited the chief executive of the
State to a seat beside him. j The Governor,
however, did not ' remain long, as he was
GOVERNOR BUDD PLEASED.
Considers the Decision of Judge McKenna of Great Importance and
Future Advantage to the State.
Governor Budd considers the decision a most important victory for the State, and one from
which good results will follow for the shipper over the different railroad lines in California. He
said last night:
"I have not yet read the decision in full, nor did I hear all of it as it was rendered.
"The legal part of the decision is, in portions, strongly in the interest of the State, although
the findings of fact by the court are equally strong against the State and led to the restraining order.
"The court has upheld the constitutionality of the Railroad Commission, its power to fix the
rates of freights and fares, but has reserved to the courts themselves the settlement of the question
as to whether such rates are reasonable. In doing this it has necessarily nullified that section of
our constitution which declares that the findings of the commission shall be conclusive.
"In my message to the Legislature I recommended a constitutional amendment reorganizing the
Railroad Commission along certain lines, and providing that its findings should not be declared con
clusive, but should be declared 'prima facie reasonable, allowing either party to apply to the courts
in case of dispute or manifest wrong.' The reason for such a recommendation is made manifest in
other parts of the message.
"There were several law points that I had hoped the court would decide in favor of the State,
but which it found against it. The findings of the court, however, as to the powers of the com
mission, as to its being the eye and the arm of the State in dealing with transportation questions,
and as to its ability to fix rates and enforce them, even without notice, make this commission in the
future one of great importance.
"We will not always have the present depression, nor will the strike of 1894 and the hard
times of 1895 enable the transportation agents to claim the reductions made by our Commissioners
entail loss upon themselves. The law being fixed, the only question for determination will be the
fact as to whether the charge imposed is reasonable or not. And if the rate fixed be not conclusive
against the railroad it should not be against the shipper.
"Whether the pise is to be appealed or not lam not informed. I presume it will be.
"This is all I can state until after I have read the whole decision carefully."

THE DECISION.
The decision abridged only as to unes
sential matters is as follows:
This suit is brought against the Board of
Railroad Commissioners to enjoiu them from
enforcing a certain resolution reducing the
rates on grain and other freight on the lines
of railroad operated by complainant. The
bill of complaint alieces the jurisdlctional
facts and the official character of respondent*,
and that the complainant is a corporation and
was incorporated and organized by an act of
the commonwealth of Kentucky empowering
it to operate the lines of railroads described
and operating them as one system generally
known as the Pacific system of complainant.
Thai it has a paid up capital stock of .$ 120,
-934,170 00, distributed among 150 share
holders.
That by the leases to it complainant is re
quired to operate and maintain said roads in
good repair, pay taxes and provide for the

payment of the interest aforesaid, which
amount in the aggregate to $8,420,000 or
thereabouts.
That none of the lesser companies, except
the California Pacific Company and Northern
Railway Company, have for more than a year
last past received or been entitled to any profit
or net income whatever, or been able to pay
any dividend to stockholders. That the rent
received by the California Pacific Company
and Northern Railway Company, after de
ducting necessary payments of interest and
expenses, amounts to less than 1% percent
per annum upon their respective capital
stock, and that this must be expended in
betterments and additions which are neces
sary for the proper operation and equipment
of the road.
That the cost and value of the properties
largely exceed the bonded indebtedness re-
spectively thereon.
That complainant has invested $4,832,
-491 78 in the purchase of property necessarily
used and necessary to be used for and in con
nection with the operation of said roads as
said Pacific system, and of said amount the
sum of $4,000,000 is invested in California.
That in order to enable complainant to
operate said road it must receive income suf
ficient to pay expense, interest, etc., and is en
titled to some profit.
That the complainant is engaged in State
and interstate traffic, and that the rules of the
latter ha^re been fixed in pursuance of the
provisions of the act to regulate interstate
commerce, and that the ratea on State traffic
have been fixed as to the roads in California
and Oregon by the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners of said States, and in Nevada and the
Territories in accordance with the laws thexeof
respectively.
That the rates upon freights arising and
transported entirely in California are now
lower, both .actually and relatively, than the
rates on freight arising and transported en
tirely within the other States, and when estab
lished were no more than sufficient to operate
said roads down to the commencement of the
year 1894, and that in that year an ususual
depression in business occurred so reducing
the business of the complainant as to render
its income insufficient to pay expenses, as
hereinbefore set forth. The said depression,
it is alleged, on information and belief, will not
be relieved and that the business will not be
increased during the present or the next en
suing year. That from time to time reduc
tions have been made in rates, and from Janu
ary, 1889, to June, 1895, to the amount of
more than 35 per cent. A table, showing the
reduction by years, is given in the bill.
Keceipts and Expenditure*.
Thnt the total receipts and expenditures of
the Pacific system during the calendar year
1894 were as follows:
Receipts $31,458.522 64
Expenditures 31,7.14,785 84
Showing a deficiency of. 278,262 70

their relative adjustment l and classification,
and are fair to shippers, and in many cases

ments of complainant as follows:

Complainant avers that there is no reason

crease of complainant's business, and tbat the
rates and reductions were resolved on arbi
trarily and without evidence ana will be un
just, unfair and unreasonable and conflsca
toryof the property rights of complainant
and its lessors.
That there Is no reason to expect a compen
sating increase of business, and hence, during
the next ensuing year there will be a defi
ciency of $2,363,82914 on the California
roads.

Complain of the Conatitution.
That the provisions of the constitution of
the State of California and the act of the Legis
lature in aid thereof are in violation of sec
tion 1 of the fourteenth amendment of the
constitution of the United States.
There were filed with the bill affidavits sup
porting its allegations and a temporary re
straining order was granted, and also an order
to show cause why it should not remain pend
ing the suit. Upon the hearing refuting affi
davits were filed by respondents, and against
these and in support of tho bill complainant
also filed other affidavits. There were also
presented voluminous extracts from the testi
mony taken by the Pacific Railway Commis
sion to show a wasteful and extravagant con
structson of certain of the roads, and also a
diversion of the revenue to dividends instead
of being employed in debt paying.
The case has been elaborately arguedâ how
elaborately is indicated by the fact thtt when
put into printed form the arguments of com
plainant's counsel occuppy 1147 pages and
those of respondents' lo3l pages. It is need
less to say that counsel were all able and that !
neither abused nor wasted the opportunity I
given to them nor neglected a single topic j
which could illustrate or expound the intricate j
problems involved in the controversy. The I
evidence and the arguments had to be con
sidered by me, and this accounts in part for
the time I have taken for decision. In part
it is accounted for by other and imperative
demands on my attention. This opinion will
be long, and, while there is justification for it,
I have, nevertheless, leaned agaiust a too
elaborate exposition, but I hope in avoidiug
prolixity I have not slighted any essential
proposition or failed to make my meaning
plain.
The many propositions urged upon my con
sideration may not with clearness be tabu
lated or presented in a determined oidcr.
Some, however, naturally assume a prece
dence, and of these the two following are
earnestly and ably urge'? by the counsel for
respondents at settling the controversy:
1. That action on the grain resolution is
completed and hence the Board ot Railroad
Commissioners has no further office to per
form. Or, putting it another way, the sched
ule has'become the law ot tbe land, to be en
forced by suit by the proper State officers or
by shippers.
2. As to the other resolution, which may bo
called the 25 per cent resolution, action has
not gone far enough. It is claimed to be but
a resolution ot inquiry upon which action is
not yet determined.
At this point the court cited tbe sections
of the State constitution and the statutes
from which the commission derives its ex
istence and powers, and continued as fol
lows:
The constitution is certainly not clear and
interpretation must be exercised by a very
careful consideration of its language.
After providing for the election of Railroad
Commissioners, it enumerates their auties as
follows (which \ shall number for the purpose
of distinction and reference):
Said Commissioners shall have the power
and it shall be their duty,
1. To establish rates of charges for transpor
tation of passengers and freights by railroad
and other transportation companies, and pub
lish the same from time to time with such
Changes as they may make.
2. To examine the book?, records and papers
of all railroad and other transportation com
panies, and for this purpose they si; i: 11 have
ihe power to issue subpenas and all other
necessary process.
3. To hear and determine complaint* against
railroad and other transportation companies,
to send for persons and papers, to administer
oaths, take testimony, and punish for con
tempt of their orders and processes in the
same manner and to tbe same extent as courts
of record, and to enforce their decisions and
correct abuses through the medium of the
courts.
4. Said Commissioners shall subscribe (pre
scribe) a uniform system of accounts to be
kept by all such corporations aud companies.
Power* of the Hoard Defined.
It is under the third of the said enumerated
provisions of the board that there is'au im
plicit direction to "enforce their decisions and
correct abuses through the medium of the
courts."
It appears, therefore, that the board may
hear and determine complaints. Wh&tcom
piaints? Surely these may be as broad as the
board's powers are, and as various as the mis
conduct of transportation companies. Upon
whose complaint? Must tbe board wait, as
a court does, to be invoked? Is it not a
different instrumentality from a court? An
active, seeking, supervising one â the eye and
the activity of the Stateâ expected to see and
do what private interests may overlook or be
deterred from doing? I think so. But, grant
I am wrong, the board has the further power
to correct abuses. What abuses? Only those
complained of or those besides which it dis
covers? If only those complained of, the
phrase "to correct abuses" is but a repetition
of the phrase "to enforce their decisions."
Primarily, we may not assume that it is super
j fluous, and reflection of the purposes of the
| constitution convinces that it was not mi
i tended to be. It must be construed as an in-
I dependent gift of power giving the Commis
i sioners as ample administrative powers in
proper places as judicial and legislative
I powers in proper places. That this construc
tion will mHke the board more efficient there
can be no doubt, and I am not disposed to in
SAN FRANCISCO JOURNALISM.
We are assured, on reliable authority, that the rumored changes in THE CALL management are yarns without
foundation. The gentleman who informed us is in close touch with the proprietors of THE CALL, and knows what he is
talking about. We do not see any necessity for a change, as Charles M. Shortrkige is conducting THE CALL on the
right principles. He labors for the interest of California, which is the secret of the present popularity of THE CALL.
When he went to San Francisco he outlined a policy of friendship for the other newspapers whereby they might labor
in harmony for the upbuilding of the State. For a few months he was let alone, but soon the envious feelings of the
Examiner began to crop out. To the interior journalists the reason for this was plain, as it was noticeable that THE
CALL advertising and subscription patronage was increasing, and this fact was sufficient for the Examiner to attempt
to break down THE CALL'S influence. This paper has gone beyond the realms of respectable journalism by attacking
Mr. Shortridge personally, and has eveti unnecessarily abused his brother, the Hon. Samuel Shortridge. Why the lat
ter should come in for vilification is something we cannot understand. He is a private citizen, holding no public office,
and in no way a subject for unjust criticism.
We have known the Shortridges for years. The success of Charles M. Shortridge in journalism has not been
paralleled on this coast. He began at the lowest round of the journalistic ladder in San Jose, and by sheer industry
and perseverance he has climbed to the top, while some of the carping newspaper writers have never been able to get
beyond their basement environment. They are the same space-writers they were years ago, envious and jealous of the
success of others. We know that the Shortridges are stayers, and, like Napoleon's old guard, they never surrender.
An attack on them only tends to increase their fighting ardor.
We have known Samuel M. Shortridge as a teacher and attorney. He was not bom with a golden spoon in his
mouth. What success he has attained has been won by energy, perseverance and merit. To the young men he is an
example of what can be accomplished in our State. It is indeed a compliment to him in one sense that he has aroused
envy and jealousy. The world is never jealous of an unsuccessful man.
The great trouble in San Francisco has been that the newspapers have indulged in too much personal
journalism, which has done incalculable damage to the State. If the space devoted to personal attacks had been
used in advocating the interests of California benefit would have resulted. The San Francisco journals have had
their imitators in the country. Some journalists prefer to write a mean, biting, cutting article regarding their
contemporaries to saying something which will benefit a community. The people have become tired of this style
of journalism, realizing that to build up the State only newspapers which advocate its interests are deserving of
support As an example of this, we are told that the day after the big Republican parade in San Francisco 175
subscribers, all business men, stopped their subscriptions to the Examiner because of its unfair and biased account
of the demonstration. We have known a journal to exist whose sole stock in trade was abuse, but the end of
such a newspaper must be the little end.
terpret any ambiguity so as to take away a
vituablo power and one so consistent with
and maybe necessary to the purposes for
which tbe commission was created.
The first contention is, therefore, not good.
The second contention is that the 25 per
cent resolution is only one of inquiry, not one
of definite action, or necessarily one even of
intended action.
Mr. La Rue and Mr. Stan ton aver that they
did not intend the resolution as a final judg
ment of the board, but that the board in
tended a more definite and particular investi
gation into the condition of the several rail
roads forming the Pacific system ot complain
ant, and that regulation or non-regulation
will depend upon that investigation, and
more explicitly and emphatically have they
stated this through their counsel.
I am disposed to accept this as true and sin
cere. Indeed Ido not know how not to do so
regarding them, as they must be regarded as
truthful, nor do I care to risk the slightest
embarrassment to them as officers in any
proper investigation of the complainant or
any of its constituent roads, the results of
which cannot be put Into torce, even if It was
desired to, except in a direct and open way,
and the detriment of which, if any, can be ar
rested before it fall.
The respondents object to the remedy of the
bill and insist that no injunction can be
granted because the things to be restrained, it
is claimed, ' are criminal prosecutious, and
them a court of equity cannot enjoin.
Not a Criminal Proceeding.
The answer to this contention is that this is
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
not a suit to restrain a criminal prosecution
It Is a suit to restrain an asserted illegal
action of the Board of Railroad Commis
sioners which will injuriously affect the inter*
ests and property rights of th 9 complainant.
There are two other propositions made by
respondents which precede the consideration
ot the merits properly so called. They are as
follows :
1. That the leases executed by the several
lessor companies to the complairant, by the
terms of which all ?f their franchises and
property were transferred, are void because
executed without express Congressional or
legislative authority, and, therefore, ultra vires
of the purposes for which those corporations
were created.
2. That the so-called Pacific system is an
nnfawful combination in violation of section
20, article XII, of the Constitution of tho
State.
These propositions are countered by the
complainant by the objections that the Bourd
of Commissioners' cannot be heard to make
either proposition; not the first, because the
leases are not open to collateral attack on the
ground of ultra vires in this proceeding and
under the circumstances of this case;
that tbe sovereign alone can object,
and that they must be held valid
until declared otherwise by a direct
proceeding. Not the second, because the board
of Railroad Commissioners has dealt with and
Its proceedings and orders are against the
Southern Pacific Company and not the several
or any of the lessor companies.
The case at bar is not between the contract*2
La Rue.
Ing partiesâ not between tne Southern Pacific
Company and its various lessor companies. It
is concerned alone with the acts of the State
as affecting the property of one of its citizens
or residents. There are no contracting wrong
doers seeking to avoid or enforce an act of
misfeasance.
It was admitted in the argument that the
Board of Commissioners dealt with transporta
tion companies as they existed as h fact, not
with the validity of their existence. It is
easily conceivable that if the latter were neci s
sary, confusi >n and weakness of administra
tion would result.'
The Comnii-sioners dealt with the Southern
Pacific Company. Their notices were served
ou it, their hearings were granted to it and
the grain schedule was served on it.
The Complainants' status.
I think, therefore, that as the Southern Pa
cific Company was rejrulated it may complain
of that regulation. Tnat if its possession and
management of the railroad properties could
be nssumed or accepted as valid by the Board
of Commissioners for the purpose of regulation
they may be by the court in order to review
the justness of that regulation. This is con
sistent and rationalâ makes effective the con
stitution and the laws and Rives full aud ef
ficient exercise to and execution of the powers
of the board.
This disposes of what may be termed the pre
liminary contentions of respondents. There
are pthers, which will be considered hereafter.
There are some urged by complainant. The
most extreme one it is difficult to state suc
cinctly and make it understood. The counsel
who made it concedes the power of regulation,
but very guardedly defines Its limits. He says
it cannot be exercised to transcena the prohi
bitions of the fourteenth amendment of the
constitution, and. stating it more directly,
says, claiming to quote Mr. Justice Field, in
Georgia Banking Company vs. Smith, 128 U.
S., 179-180. that its only rightful exercise is
"to prevent extortion by nn reasonable charges
and favoritism by unjust discrimination."
This, counsel says, is the fullest power the
State has either by Legislature or commission
and the fullest power the State in reason
should went or exercise. To bring into clear
prominence his idea he stated the value of a
railroad to be what it could earn without in
terference vith its rates under what he termed
the normal play of natural and economic laws,
and if exercising this liberty it treat all alike,
then a reduction of its rates would be a taking
of property without compensation or depriving
it oi the equal protection of the laws.
An explanation of these economic laws we
need not make, but it is certain that they are
not the same for a road which has no com
petitors as for a road which has competitors,
not the same for monopoly as for competition.
In the former case what certainty would
there bs of a reduction of rate*? That would
depend upon the railroad's sense of its own
interests and the public interests. This sense
might or might uot bean enlightened one â
might or might not be a liberal oneâ and
economic laws might, therefore, plead in vain
for observance. Ido not say they would, but
might, and does not experience of the disposi
tion and conduct of men admonish that all
power is at times abused? The rightâ abstract
right â of the State, therefore, to reduce rates
seems to be a necessity. Whether it should in
any case be exercised or not is another ques
tion. Does the light exist? That I think it
does I may have sufficiently indicated in con
sidering the contentions of respondents.
The power of the State stops at injustice.
The rights of a railroad stop at injustice. The
State may not fix a rate unreasonably low. It
may prevent a railroad from fixing one un
reasonab'.y nigh. If a law gives a railroad
privileges it exacts from it duties. It exacts
that it serve all at reasonable charges; serve
all faithfully and without favor or discrimina
tion.
The other contentions of the complainant
either deny the legality of the commlsion or
tbe legality of its action.
Under the first it is urged that the pro
vision 01 the California constitution which
makes the rates conclusively just and reason
able in all its controversies, civil and crim
inal, is in conflict with the fourteenth amend
ment to tne constitution of the United States.
(3) Being void, and being also indissolubly
blended with the provisions creating the com
mission, these are also void.
(4) That no notice to the railroad is pro
vided lor.
(5.) That the provisions of the constitution
apply to railroads owned by railroad corpora
tions and companies and not to railroads gen
era.ly, and that its penalties have also the
'same discrimination, and hence the complain
ed is deprived of the equal protection of the
laws.
Under the second, it is urged that two of the
Commissioners (Mr. La Rue and Mr. Stanton)
took such a pledge before (election as to dis
qualify them from acting/and that La Rue
was interested, because a shipper of grain,
and hence a judge in his own case. And be
cause the board acted arbitrarily and contrary
to tru evidence or any evidence adduced be
fore the board.
It is In effect admitted, or at any rate is es
tablished by authority, that the provision
which gives conclusiveness to the rates fixed
by the Commissioners is void, but it is claimed
that it Is clearly separable from the power to
establish rales. The power and the effect of
the exercise of the power as evidence, and the
penalties which may follow fiom disobedience
are clearly separable, and being so one can
not vitiate the other.
It is, however, further urged that the con
clusive prov'sion was ihÂ« main inducement of
the others, and that the latter would not have
been adopted independently of the others, and
to sustain this view extracts are given from
the speeches of certain of tbe members Of the
constitutional convention. .They are too long
and too many to quote. It is enough tosay that
.hey do not go that far and, besides, the speak
ers v, ere but a few members of a large con
vention and, besides again, they can be no
index of what mention the people had by
their adoption of the constitution.
The objection that the provisions of the Cali
fornia constitution creating the Board of Rail
road Commissioners is invalid because they
I*o not require notice to the railroads is cer
tainly doubtful as law, if it be not disputable
as a correct interpretation of those provisions.
Decisions are then cited and quoted
from 111 1 show that notice ia not necessary.
Election Fledge* Ignored.
The other contentions, based on the interest
of La Rue as a shipper of grain and on the
pledges of La. Rue aud Stanton before election.
Hre of no especial consequence â the former
because the grain rate reso.ution was adopted
by a unanimous vote, and the latter because,
after all, the final inquiry must be, Were the
reductions resolved upon reasonable? And we
are aided little in that inquiry or into the con
ditions and circumstances involved in it by a
consideration of -Vr. istanton's prejudice or
no;:-prejud!cÂ».
This brings us to the other contentions of re-y
spondeuts' and to the merits of the contro
versy. They are:
1. Tbiitlfsuch rales produce any revenue,
much or little, they are reasonable.
2. That they (respondents; are entitled to

have the grain rates considered separate from j
the 25 jier cent resolution; that there must be
a showing as to each, not as to both indistin- â 
guishably.
3. Even if joined, the showing not sufficient.
(1) This is claimed tS be established by au
thority. Ido not think so. It seems to have
been decided in the Dey case. Thirty-fifth
Federal. But the same learned Judge who
expressed that view in the Dey case retracted
it in the Ames case, Sixty-fourth Federal, and
it has received no judicial sanction since.
When the power of judicial review was as
serted aud entertained the fourteenth amend
ment to the constitution was bound to be
firmly and accurately applied. There could
bs no middle ground. ,M ddle ground would
satisfy neither legislative prerogative nor |
judicial prerogative. Certainly not the ju- j
dicial prer gative. That must apply justice
as it is understood of men, and in its clear
light it was inevitable that it would come to I
be seen that the fourteenth amendment of the
constitution would be a composition of delu
sive words if it forbid only the taking of the
physical property while It permitted the
U.king of its valueâ if its guaranties of the j
law's equal protection to all persons would be
satisfied as to railroads by leaving them a
microscopical profit. If so, the pool of Tanta- !
lus would lose its force to illustrate excited
and disappoiuted expectation when compared
with the organic law of tn is great land.
We Should keep in mind that the regulation
of a railroad affects, in reality, the natural
persons who own it, not the insensible legal
artificiality and abstraction called a corpora
tion. For the natural persons the protection
of the constitution is intended, and would any
one say that justice is done them If their in
vestment be allowed only an infinitesimal
fraction of 1 per cent while ail other invest
ments are expected to return at least legal in
terest, with irsedom besides erf unlimited aa
vantage?
(2) The respondents are entitled to have
the grain rates considered separately from tne
25 per cent reduction on other freights, but
the showing may be good for either, and hence
need not distinguish.
It would seem, aiso, if this were so, that the
respondents might show and should show it
against the statement of tne complain
ant that the rates are not discrimina
tive; but another answer is that such '
a showing would be too extensive lor a
preliminary inquiry and absolutely intractable
by affidavit. Another answer is that tbe action
of the board negatives the fact upon which it
is based. It does not seem conceivable, if that
fact be true, that the Board of Railroad Com- I
missioners would have passed a resolution !
which by its horizontal application preserved, j
and may be intensified, whatever discrimina
tion existed between the grain rates and other
rates. . t â¢
(3) The Attorney-General sayt that he can
demonstrate beyond th,e possibility of a plaus- I
ible explanation that complainant has failed ;
to make sucn a showing as would entitle It to |
the relief prayed for, even if the 8 per cent
and 25 per cent reductions could, under any
circumstances, be considered jointly. On the
other hand, Mr. Herrin says shat the com
plainant is not asking for a single dollar of I
dividend, because existing rates and business '
are not sufficient to pay diviaends. It oniy
seeks revenue enough to pay interest on I
bonds, to pay operating expenses and to pay
taxes. Present rates, under the experience of
1894, were insufficient for such payment.
The elements of the controversy will be
stated as we proceed. It may, however, be
premised here that Justice Brewer said in
tbe Dey case. "Compensation implies three
thingsâ payment of the cost of service, Interest
on bonds and then some dividend." Adequate
dividend, subsequent cases say. These, then,
are the factors of compensation to be ap
plied.
A Matter of Figures.
Complainant's bill, after a' somewhat de
tailed statement of tbe amounts payable by
complainant under the leases to it, gives a
summary of the receipts and expenditures,
which shows:
A deficiency on the Pacific system
for the year of 1894 Ot $276,262 70
F0r1895 1,476,176 39
In tho amendment to tbe bill there
is an exhibit of the receipts and ex
penditures of tbe California roads
of tbe system showing a surplus
for 18940r 434,497 05
For 1896 (ending June 3o) adeflcitof 863,691 29
The Attorney-General claims that this show
in? is incorrect for three reasons:
(1) Because there is included a defi
cit of tbe Oregon aud California
road Id the sum of $541,355 71
(2) Because there are included In ex
penditures on the various roads for
improvements and bttterments tbe
sum of 654,823 81
(3) Because there is included !n ex
penditures as operating expenses
tbe rent paid to tbe Calltornia Pa
cific road In tbe sum of 600,000 00
If tbe last (3) be good it is conceded
that tbe deficit on the Pacific sys
tem, including ibe other objected
items, will amount to 24,131 20
If not good the deficit wilt amount to 54,905 Â«5
For the time being I will assumelthis objec
tion to be good and will consider the other
objections.
Is the deficit of tbe Oregon and California
road a proper expenditure of complainant?
The second ground of objection, that is,
that to improvements and betterments there,
will have to be consideredâ first, the abstract
legality of such a charge, and, second, the
competency of it under the leases.
Tbe abstract legality of such a charge is
established by the Reagan c&se.
Improper Ezpenie Charges.
The competency of the charge under the
leases depends, of course, upon their provi
sions. It is provided in the lease from the
Oregon and California Railroad Company
that the complainant shall pay out of the
earnings and income "the expenses of repair
ing, tnnintaining, improving, adding to and
keeping up the said leased railroads, with
their appurtenances." Construing this pro*
vision by the light of the Reagan case and
other cases supra, the expenditures made are
properly chargeable against the income.
In reference to repairs and betterments
on the Central Pacific Railroad the court
held:
If the railroad was added to or bettered it
was to be out of the income to which the Cen
tral Pacific Company was entitled and which
would, if uot so expended, be paid to it. It is
true that (he lease provides for the contin
gency of the payment of such expense by the
Southern Pacific Company, but it also provides
for its repayment, so that it is not in any case
a deduction from its revenue. Hence it fol
lows that the item of $111,786 71 for better
ments and' additions to the Central Pacific
Company should not be allowed as an expendi
ture of the Southern Pacific Company.
Under the lease of tlie California^Pacific
road the Southern Pacific Company is required
to "better the same at its own expanse." The
expenditure, therefore, by it was made and in
its report it was charged to itself.
The lease of the Northern Railway Company
provides that additions and betterments are
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1896.
Stanton.
"a charge to the said lessor, and the settle
ment therefore shall be made annnally."
They therefore should not be allowed to the
Southern Pacific Company.
The lease of the Northern California Rail
road provides that the Southern Pacific Com
pany shall "add to and better tho same during
the term." This expenditure, therefore. Is a
proper charge of the Southern Pacific Com
pany.
Tneiease of the South Pacific Coast Rail
road Company is too long to quote.
It is said by counsel for the respond
ents that it "is a virtual convey
ance of the property for the term (fifty-five
years) without any recompense to the lessor
other than the payment of its annual liabili
ties and a guaranty of its bonded indebted
ness." Granting this is so, it yet devolves upon
th* Southern Pacific Company to maintain the
road and the making of such improvements as
have already been described was a proper
expenditure by it, hence a pioper item of
charge 'to be made by it.
In the omnibus lease, so called, in which the
Southern Pacific: Company (of California, Ari
zona arvd New Mexico, respectively) lease to
complainant there is this provision:
â¢'Thirdâ The betterments and additions to
said leased properties shall be made by the
said Southern Pacific Company.and settlement
therefor made annually at the same time that
payment is made for the net profits as herein
provided, and each of said railroad companies
shall be charged respectively with the amount
of payments made for betterments and addi
tions to the property owned by it."
This makes the betterment and improve
ments an expenditure of trie several compa
nies, not of the Southern Pacific Company,
and therefore not to be allowed to it.
The remaining objection is that made to the
rental of $600,000 to be paid to the California
Pacific road. I see no objection to this $600,
-000 rental. It is an annual expenditureof the
Southern Pacific Company, to be annually re
imbursed to it from the income of the road
with other expenditures. The deficit on that
road, therefore, can be regarded, if the other
charges are correct, to be $54,905 65.
After a review and consideration of elab
orate tables of figures submitted by both
sides, the court states it as bis conclusion
that there was a "deficit for 1895 -from tbe
operation of the road entirely io California
of $552,896 51."
The decision concludes as follows:
In this computation is not included land de
partment expeuses, taxes on land, back taxes
or taxes on franchises held ie.jal by the Su
preme Court.
From this showing it is perfectly evident
that there should be no reduction of rates of
tbe Southern Pacific Company, either regard
ing trie Pacific system or the California roads,
unless its business increases. \ls there a pros
pect of that so near thnt the court will be justi
fied in dissolving or withholding its injuuetion
against the new rates?
It is alleged in the bill that when the rates
in California were established by complainant
they "were no more than sufficient to eunble
your orator to operate said railroads as alorc
said, and so remained down to the commence
ment of the year 1894. That in said year an
unusual depression in business occurred, and
the freight and passengers offered to your
orator for transportation over said railroads
were so reduced in quantity and number that
your orator was unable from the Income de
rived therefrom, at the rates aforesaid, to pay
the charges, costs and expenses necessary for
the conduct of its business and the security of
its property, as hereinbefore set forth.
"That said business depression has continued
to the present time, and there is no indication
that it will be relieved or the volume of freight
and passenger traffic be increased during the
present or next ensuing year ; and your orator
is informed and believes and therefore avers
that said business depression will not be re
lieved or such freight and passenger traffic be
increased during tne present or the next en
suing year."
These allegations of the depression of busi
ness and the possibilities of its continuance
were attempted to be supported or denied by
the respective parties by affidavits necessarily
more or less speculative and conjectural, and
the power of the court to take judicial notice
of it and make special applications of it was
asserted or denied. Bnt there need be no con
jecture, nor need the court resort to any but
the ordinary methods of proof. The business
of the complainant has certainly decreasod, as
is apparent from the evidence. How 1894
compared with 1893 I do not know. How
1894 compared with 1895 has been shown,
and the difference is easily understood and ac
counted for. It could have no other c*use but
a depression In business affecting the market
and transportation oi all articles.
The depression existed when the bill in this
case was filed, towit, October 14, 1895. and
there has been nothing offered to show a
change. I may not assume one, even from the
sources of judicial notice, so definite as to time
or amount as to determine a judicial view or
action. But this is not seriously important.
The regulation of the rates ou classes of freight
other than grain does not now embarrass our
consideration. Before final action shall be de
termined or taken on them by the Board of
Commissioners and before they shall be ex
pressed in a schedule this case can be tried.
Before any considerab.e movement in grain it
can be tried, and the conclusions from this
preliminary showing be confirmed or refuted
and a final injunction be granted or denied. I
canuot refrain from saying to that oppor
tunity and time the parties to this suit
should eagerly look and eagerly prepare.
Great problems are awaiting solution
which will receive their solution, or com
mence to receive their solution, then and by
it. Then and by it will be shown whether
that allegation of the complaint be true, "that
the rates now in force upon the several rail
roads operated by it as aforesaid have been
fixed according to conditions and circum
stances surrounding the traffic, and with a
careful regard for the commercial and com
petitive conditions which enter into, effect or
control the making and relative adjustment
of rates and classifications and commodities in
the territory traversed by said railroads, and
in many cases are now fixed at the actual cost
of transportation, by reason of competition
with other carriers by railroad and water.'.'
Or that other averment of respondents be
true, that "affiant is informed and believes,
and the history of the complainant corpora
tion in this State, with which ha is familiar,
confirms him in such belief, and he there
fore avers that in mnnv cases the rate
of transportation is fixed at about the
actual cost of such transportation at points
where it is the interest and object of the com
plainant to crush out opposition and destroy
the property of competing common carriers;
and that large expenditures of money have
been made which were unwarranted and un
called for by the commercial conditions exist
ing at the present time, or in the near future,
but that such expenditures were made and
large properties created for the purpose of
destroying competition and destroying the
properly interests of others who enter into
competition as common carriers, and the dis
criminating rates are made in favor of persons
Clark.
and plnces which approximate the cost of
transportation, with the view to serve the ends
and dbjactsoi this complainant in the creation
of a monopoly, and the losses entailed by such
reduction of rates and discrimination and cre
ation of property are unjustlyj ustly and unreason
ably fixed upon charges of freight and rates
in other portions of the State that the revenue
of this eompininant corporation moy be miiin
tained without rep;ard to the true interests of
commerco and The lights of the public or the
justness or reasonableness cf the rates of
chnrÃes for the transportation of freight
within the State of California."
The vit w I have taken of the showing made
by the complainant makes -it unnecessary to
consider thMt made by the United States. In
the latter there are elements wliich are not in
the former, and to Rive them proper attention
would delay decision too long. Besides, the
right of the Government to intervene was
again challenged by respondents, and with
such strength of oljection as to justify a re
view of its allowance, which I think is better
postponed to a later stage of the case.
The order of the court, therefore, is that a
part of the order staying the execution of the
resolution of the Boarfi of Railroad Commis
sioners, reducing rates on grain 8 per cent, be
continued until the lurther order of the court:
that the balance of the restraining order be
dissolved.

Declares It a Victory for the Com

Andrew J.Glunie, who at the time the

ceedings to reduce rates on the Southern

.To my mind the decision of Judge McKenna
is a great victory for the Railroad Commission.
While it is true. that he holds that in the pre
liminary hearing and before trial he does not
consider the evidence before him sufficient to
justify a reduction of the rates of the company,
still on .questions of law which have been
mooted for years and which , the railroad com
pany has continually held over "the heads of
the people, his decision is conclusive, and. by
itÂ°it is now settled. that the commission as at
present constituted is a constitutional body
and has power to fix rates of transportation,'
ana that no notice of such I fixing is requisite
to the company prior to the adoption ot such
rates by the commission. -:.:â -â â¢
Judge McKenna justly complained that the
showing made : before him of operating ex
penses, fixed charges and cost of construction
of the roads operated by the Southern Pacific
Company was - very meager. The company
simply presents lump figures. It is absolutely
necessary that these matters should be gone
into in detail, and In my opinion it is the duty
of the commission \at i once \to I institute - a
t)ii>Tt>i*gh a*d complete investigation into
each of these' items and for this purpose to
require the production before it of the books'

rectly raised and passed upon in these Rail

of authority seems to be that as long as some
compensation is ; given * the courts - have no
power to interfere. : Interest on bonds, accord
ing to my understanding, is such compensa
tion, and I do not believe the law will require
rates to be so fixed as to pay any rate of inter
est that may be agreed upon between bond
holders and the railroad. s ." ;

THEY FOUGHT ft DRAW.
Tommy Tracey and Jim Ryan's
Ciever Contest at Union
Hall.
Rcchelte Outclassed Builer, Who
fought Very Feu lyâ Stelzner
Defeat d Johns, n.
The Golden West Sporting Cinbdistin
tinguished itself last night by drawing i ff
at Union Hall one of the cleanest and
cleverest boxing contests ever held in
this City, and at the same time a slogging
and foaling match, many of which would
cause the sport to die a natural death.
Tbe fight between Tommy Tracey and
Jim Ryan, refereed by Dal Hawkins, â  re
suited in a draw. The decision produced
groat dissatisfaction on both sides.
Ryan's admirers, who crowded the gal
lery, hissed and hooted generally at the
verdict, while the judges of boxing in
general thought Tracey deseived the de
cision on account of taking the aggressive
and delivering the most punishing blows.
The bull was only half tilled when
Chnrles Rochette and Harry Batler, both
of San Francisco, stepped upon the stage
for an eight-round "j;o." Billy Jordan
acted as master of ceremonies and Billy
O'DonnÂ«ll its releree.
This was a slogging match pure and sim
ple in which Butler disgraced both him
self and bib club by striking his man while
down, while tbe referee was separating the
principals in a clinch and once after the
gur.g bud sounded.
Both men fcuzht like wild animals, and
at the close of the last round Rochette
bad Butler on Queer streÂ°t and thirty sec
onds more wouid have finished him.
O'Donnell waa s verely censured during
the course of the battle for not stopping
the fijrhtand giving Rochette the decision.
A' the end he decided in Roche tte's favor
amid great applause.
Prior to tne next match Jordan an
nounced that the benefit to old Jack Davis
had been postponed til December 8. Tom
Johnson of Marysville and Jack Stelzner
of St. Louis then stepped jnto the ring for
an eight-round contest.
The contest proved merely child's play
for Stelzner, who tapped his opponent at
will for three roundtt, receiving only an
occasional light blow in return. In the
fourth round, after punching Jobnson
heavily on both face and body, Stelzner
met a rush with a clean left-hander on tie
point oi the jaw that floored Johnson.
As he was counted out Stelzner helped
carry him to his corner.
The event of the evening was the battle
between Tom Trat.ey of Australia and
Jim Ryan of Cincinnati. It was a game
and clever fight.
Tracey's seconds were "Spider" Kelly,
Billy Delaney and Johnny Croweil. Ryan
was "esquired" by Professor Frank Allen
Billy O'Donnell and James Gallagher.
Dal Hawlsins, the refere \ had an "easy
time, mostly sitting in a corner.
In the third round Tracey fell by the
force of his own blow and Ryan promptly
assisted him to his feet, whereupon the
men shook bands before resuming fistic re
lations. Tracey later on returned this
courtesy and both men were loudly
cheered.
The following description of the fight by
rounds will show tliat Tracey forced the
fighting and .delivered the most blows,
thereby, in the opinion of competent
critica, deserving the decision instead of a
draw.
Bound Iâ The men spar lor an opening.
Tracey lauds a light left on the body and is
countered with a left In the face. Both clinch,
followed by a rally. Ryan ducks a vicious left
and lightly taps Tracey on the ribs. Tracey

ropes. He lands a hard rit;ht on Ryan's body
as the gong sounds. Honors even.
Round 2â The men clinch after sparring.
Tracey lands a left on the face and a right
swing on the body in a breakaway. Trucey

DIMWIT'S CASE
ON FOR MONDAY
Suprems Court Will Be
Asked to Admit
Briefs.
Messrs Deuprey and Dickinson
Will Both Off-r Oral
Arguments.
If the SnpTenn Court Rescinds Its
Order the Proce dings Will
Not B: Final.
On Monday next the Supreme ConTt
will sit to hear arguments concerning the
Betting aMde of a recent order of the court
made at Los Angeles, by which Durrant's
attorneys, Messrs. Deuprey and Dickin
son, were shut out from filinÃ their brief,
the time for filing having elapsed and the
Attorney-General moving to have the case
submitted. Since the order was made
the attorneys for Durrant have completed
their brief and have sent it to t c clerk's
offices of the Supreme Court, where it
remains awaiting lurther action.
The general opinion is that the Supreme
Court, considering that the life of a man
is at. stake, will be inclined to five Dur
rant's attorneys every possible opportu
nity to show, if they can, whether there
were errors in the proceedings in tbe Su
perior Court dm ing Durrant's trial suffi
cient to justify a setting aside of the ver
dict there found and also the sentence and
to cause a rehearing of the case upon its
merits.
Durrant is reported to face the forth
coming Hearing with the same calm com
posure thnt he has manifested since he
first avpeared in public as the accused
murderer of two gins. When he heard
from Los Angeles that tbe court bad de
cided not to wait any longer for the tiling
of briefs, he said only that he had confi
dence in his attorneys and was in no way
cast down by the news. The issue of the
hearing next Monday will involve h\r, lite.
The expectation is tbat the arguments
moy be quite long, the matter being of
much importance.
The State will be represented by Attor
ney-General Fitzgerald. The hearing on
Monday next will not be final. If the
court should decide to rescind the order
made at Los Angeles and permit tbe filing
of briefs 'n behalf of Durrant, time win
be allowed for the Attorney -General to file
his answer. Altogether some months may
elapse before it will be finally known
whether Durrant will once more ba tried
for his life.

Major McKinley Competent
to Make the Proper
Selections.
But Callers of Prominence Con
tinue to Pay Their Re
jpects at Canton.
Those Who Discuss the Tariff More
Welcome Than Those Who
Seek Patronage.
CANTON, Ohio, Nov. 30.â Major Mc-
Kinley had a busy day with bis Con
gressional callers to-day, and it was 5
o'clock this evening before he bad a
minute be could call his own.
Senator Henry Cabot Lod^e came from
Washington to discuss the possibilities of
legislative action at the approaching ses
sion. Senator Lodge represents the Reed
contingent in New England politics more
thoroughly than tny one else, and the
fact that he made tbe trip to Canton to
do what Reed recently neglected to do is
regarded by many as an indication that
he would accept what Mr. Reed's friends
declare be would not, namely, a position
in the Presidential household. He was
closeted for some time with Major Mc-
Kinley, but the object of Mb visit, if it
bad a more specific one than to testify his
good will toward the incoming adminis
tration, was not manifested.
General Horace Porter of New York re
mained with Major McKinley until late
this afternoon. General Porter said that
while no positive arrangements bad been
made as to the chief marshalship of tne
inauguration ceremonies, it would doubt
less be arranged satisfactorily, though no
names would be mentioned until after the
headquarters were opened in Washington.
"So far as Cabinet-making is con
cerned," said General Porter, "I nevÂ«r
knew a Cabinet to be completed until very
near the 4th of March. I know of no man
who is better equipped in the matter of
wide acquaintanceship with public men
throughout the country than Major Mc-
Kinley. He is perfectly qualified to make
his own selections and when it is done it
will be his own handiwork."
As to his own ambitions in this direc
tion General Porter said that his visit hmd
no significance, as be had called upon a
friend of many years' standing to pay his
personal respects.
Dr. T. N. Jamieson, Republican National
committeeman from Illinois, called on
Major McKinley to-night. Dr. Jamieson
pointed with pride to the enormous vie- |
tory won in Illinois, and said that while j
his State would be glad to find recognition '
at Major McKinley 's bands it does not pro
pose to embarrass Major McKinley with
any c'aim?.
"We are perfectly willing to rest our case (
in McKinley '* hands," said he to-night,
"and beli* ye that he will in a proper way
recognize the services of the Republicans
of that great State."
Henry T. Oxnard of Nebraska, president
of the National Beet Sugar Association;
C. T. Sheldon of Michigan, T. E. Burton
of Cleveland and H. C. Van Voorhis of
Ohio called upon the major this afternoon.
Many of Major McKinley's callers are
urging the necessity of an early revision
of the tariff, and new Congressmen are
especially anxious for an extra session of
the body to which they have been elected.
There is little doubt, too, that the callers
who talk tariff legislation to tbe President
elect find a much readier listener than
those who discuss local patronage, or even
Cabinet possibilities. Ti.e fact that there
will be a week's shorter session before
Christmas this winter than iast, and the
unlikelihood of any proper discussion of
the tariff by the outgoing Congress, gives
weight to the belief here that an extra ses
sion is an absolute necessity.
Mr. and Mrs. J. Russell Young of Phila
delphia dined with Major and Mrs, Mc-
Kinley this evening.
TALKS ABOUT IBE CABINET.
Fetter Says 11 ann Would Lower Bis I
' Dignllif by Accepting a Place.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 30.-Ei-Secre
tary of the Treasury Foster is a guest at
the Fifth-avenue Hotel. In an interview
to-day with a reporter of the United As
sociated. Presses he said that in a recent
conversation held with ex-Senator Platt
of New York the latter heartily indorsed
C. N. Bliss for Secretary of the Navy.
Personally Foster said he had always bad
great admiration for Mr. Bliss. â¢
He thought the acceptance of any place
in the Cabinet on the part of Mr.Hanna
would belittle him. â  He declared he had
achieved more distinction and reputation
than is ordinarily achieved by a public
man in a lifetime and his position is
highly honorable. As fame is the only
reward for public effort, he has reached
tbe zenith, and holding office might de
tract from it but could not add to it.
With regard to the Ohio senatorship,
Mr. Foster said he had always had an am
bition to be Senator. "I would be a can
didate now," he continued, "but for my
financial misfortunes, and I may be a can
didate anyway."
â¢ Mr. Foster * spoke enthusiastically of
Senator Sherman's fitness for the treasury
portfolio. .', He had : not seen 'â > Major Mc-
Kinley and had no inkling as to' bis Cabi
net slate. ,He did not know of any Cabi
net candidates in Ohio. He did not think
it wise to put a sound -money Democrat in
the Cabinet.
â¢ '"The Cabinet," he continued, "should
be harmonious in every respect. It would
be somewhat incongruous to have a gold
free-trade Democrat in the Cabinet.' 1 -
He thought it would be unwise to pass
the Dingley ;biil; which he characterized
as a continuation of the Wilson bill, ex
cept that it is a 15 per cent advance in
the tariff.' He was opposed to ad valorem
features of the bill because they admitted
of the perpetration of big frauds on the
Government. , - ..â¢

DEATH OF WILLIAM STEINWAY.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 30.- William Stein way, the rapid transit commis
sioner and the head of the famous piano-house of Steinway & Sons, died of typhoid
fever at his residence, 26 Grarumercy Park, at 3:30 o'clock this morning. He was
taken ill three weeks aeo yesterday, and although his condition was serious, he
rallied and hopes were entertained of his recovery until Jast night, when he suf
fered a relapse. He passed away surrounded by relatives and friends.
William Steinway was born in Zesen, Duchy of Brunswick, on March 5, 1836.
He came to the United States with his family in 1850, and influenced by his love
cf music, persuaded his parents to apprentice him to a firm who were manufactur
ing pianos in this city. He remained with that firm for three years, then he left it
to start in the piano manufacturing business with his father and two brothers,
Charles and Henry.
Mr. Steinway was a prominent member of the committee of seventy which
opposed Tammany in 1871 and destroyed the influence of the Tweed regime of that
period. He was unanimously elected a member of the National Democratic Com
mittee, and was a delegate to the St. Louis convention in 1888, when President
Cleveland was nominated for a second term. Offers of political positions were
repeatedly showered upon him, but upon the plea of business were nearly always
declined. Among the positions offered him were the sub-treasurvsliip of the
United States, the office of Secretary of State, the governorship of New York and
the mayoralty of this city. Less distinguished positions, however, he accepted
readily. Thus he was for many years president of theJLiederkranz Society in New
York and president of the German Musical Festival last year. He also served
some years as president of the Rapid Transit Commission.
Ry bis personal efforts a model town, with every comfort for employe?, was
built up about his Long Island piano factories. This settlement bears his own
name. Steinway was married twice, surviving both- his wives. In appearance he
was heavily built and of great physical strength.
The German Emperor in 1892 appointed him piano manufacturer to the im
perial court and he received other marks of distinguished consideration not only
from tbe Kaiser but from other crowned heads as well. In politics Mr. Steinway
was always a Democrat. In the recent campaign he was one of the foremost
advocates of a gold currency. .
gesting such changes in tbe existing Cur
rency laws as will forever keep the ques
tion out of politics and insure a perma
nency in financial methods. The cities to
be represented are Cincinnati, Chicago,
Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Dcs Moines,
Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, Minneapolis,
St. Paul, Omaha, Peoria, St. Louis, To
ledo, Louisville, Indianapolis.
The delegates already here seem to favor
the idea of combining tbe tariff and finan
cial policies and adopting a plan that will
put both beyond the possibility of imme
diate cbantres. Indianapolis will be a
strong bidder for the monetary convention,
should it be decided to hold one, which is
quite likely.

CREDITORS TO DIVIDE ASSETS.
Fraudulent Transactions of the American
Oak Leather Company Declared
Null and Void.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 30.â A sensation
was caused in business circles to-day
by a decision of Judge GroÃscup in the
Federal court, in the case of the American
Oak .Leather Company against th,e C. H.
Fargo Company, declaring the transac
tions by which the bankrupt shoe manu
facturers made the United States Robber
Company and the Metropolitan National
Bank of this city preferred creditors were
fraudulent. As a result the assets,
amounting to $300,000, will be divided
among the creditors, many of whom are
Eastern concerns. The petition for a re
ceiver was granted, thus making the
previous lejral proceedings brought by the
favored creditors to get all the assets null
and void.

BRYAN TALKS ABOUT BIMETALLISM.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 30.â 1n the December number of the North American Review, published to-morrow, Mr.
Bryan presents an article in which he discusses tbe result of the election as aff acting the status of the silver question. The
issue on which the election turns he declares to be "the greatest issue ever submitted to the American people in time
of peace." The declaration of the Chicago convention in favor of the tree coinage of silver carried upon the people of this
country a study of the money question in general. The result of this study Mr. Bryan declares to be temporary defeat but
permanent victory for the cause of bimetallism.
Mr. Bryan regards it as a significant fact that the silver sentiment was strongest where the question had been longest
considered; that is to say, in the West and South, the gold sentiment prevailing in the Eastern States, but even there,
in Mr. Aryan's opinion, the cause of bimetallism made more rapid progress than any cause ever made in such a short
time.
The orders against bimetillism in the Middle States were very great. In Minnesota the Democratic party declared
against silver. In Michigan the convention was nearly equally divided, and there was a bitter contest within the party in
lowa, Indiana and Ohio, while in Illinois the hostile influence of the Chicago press was greatly felt. Mr. Brytn expresses
bimself as sure that the conclusive settlement of the question at issue is not far away. Mr. Greeley was defeated in 1872
and yet Mr. TiJaen was elected in 1876. Mr. Blame was defeated in 1884, but Mr. Harrison was elected in 1888. The Repub
lican victory ol 1888 was followed by the Democratic victory of 1890 and the election of President Cleveland two years later.
Mr. Bryan counsels the Republican party to remember that thousands of Republicans have been held to their party
this year by the pledge that they will try to secure international bimetallism. In regard to the gold-siandard Democrats,
Mr. .Bryan is assured that they cannot do as much harm in 1900 as they have done this year.
"They cannot," ne says, "disguise themselves again. The contest for financial independence will go on. We under
took the contest with a disorganized army; we emerged from it a united and disciplined force, without the loss of a
soldier. We are ready for another contest. We believe that we are right, and believing that right will finally triumph we
face the futuie firm in the belief that bimetallism will be restored."

WAS WANTED FOR EMBEZZLEMENT
Edgar Lytle, Who Committed Suicide at
Chicago, Had Squandered Funds
of Employers.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 30.â Edgar Lytle,
who registered at the Kirn ball Hotel
Saturday as E. L. Bryan and afterward
committed suicide, is said to have been
wanted in New York for embezzlement.
When there recently he was in the era
plov of the firm of Tower & Dauphin, 36
and 38 Broadway. A branch office of this
firm is located in Pittsburg, where Lytle
was last seen a few days ago. Ernest V.
Abbott, who represents Tower & Dauphin
in this city, received a letter from Mr.
Dauphin last Saturday stating that Lytle
was an embezzler and tbat warrants had
been issued for bis arrest. Abbott notified
the police here to-night and gave them
the description contained in the letter.
It tallies in every detail with that of the
suicide, and little doubt remains tbat the
body is that of Lytle. The police appar
ently made little effort to identify the
body, and no evidence was produced at
the inquest this afternoon to show who he
was, notwithstanding the lact that a
valise is at the office of the Adams Express
Company containing a picture of the sui
cide and a number o' documents indi
cating; that it is the property of Edgar
Lytle. The police do not know officially
of thÂ« existence of this valise, although it
has been brought to their attention.
They knew of this before the inquest, but
took no notice of the matter, and the
name of Lytle was not mentioned during
the proceedings over the body.
The jury returned a verdict of suicide
and added the supposition that the body
was that of E. L. Bryan, the name under
which he registered at tbe hotel.
Clfrmland Mot to lie Dean.
BALTIMORE, Mp., Nov. 30.â President

NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 30.â The first
definite news in the shape of details of the
capture of the town of Guayamaro, in the
district of Camajney, Cuba, by the patri
ots arrived in this city to-day in the form
of a personal letter from General Ualixto
Garcia to the Junta in New street. It
was directed to one of bis adjutants, who
brought it to this city. The report of the
siege and capture which was cabled here
from Havana has been denied by the
Spanish authorities, but the Cuban
leaders in this city declare
that General Garcia's letter leaves
no doubt now that tbe report
was correct. It states that the siege of
the garrisons of 295 men in the twelve
small forts in the town lasted twelve days.
When the officers surrendered the Cubans
took as prisoners all the men in charge of
the forts, wnicn included one captain,
two lieutenants, two sub-lieutenants,
eighteen sergeants.one surgeon and sixteen
corporals. AH the officers were paroled,
but the men were lent to the mountains
to work on the Cuban plantations. The
constitution of the Cuban Government
provides for tbe release of these prisoner 3(
and it was at the request of the men tbat
they were sent to the plantations, the let
ter states.
The booty captured by General Garcia's
men was a great boon to the patriots. It
included 500 cantenes (a gold piece worth
$5 30) and other moneys aggregating $21,
-000, 200 Mansur rifles. 125 rounds of am
munition, six pack mules loaded with
medicines and stores and 500 machetes,
besides a quantity of clothing. The letter
concludes oy statins that the captured
soldiers preferred the protection of the
Cubans to the liberty that was offered to
them.
Guayamaro is in the district of Caraa
juey and in the province of Puerto Prin
cipe, and is a three days' march from tbe
capital of that province.
It was said by the Cuban leaders in this
city to-night that news of the capture of
Puerto Principe is expected daily from
Cuba. Gnaymaro had a population of
from 4000 to 5000 persons.
The Sun's Havana correspondent, writ
ing under date of November 25, says:
"The Cuban war has now reached its cli
max of devastation and bloodshed. Gen
eral Weyler, as acknowledged by bimself
| in interviews with prominent Spaniards
in his palace in Havana, lias resolved to
exterminate all the Cubans in tbe prov
ince of Pinar del Rio not engaged as sol
diers in tbe Spanish ranks, no matter
how peaceful and harmless they appear.
"They must go to one side or to the
other," he said, "and neither women nor
children will be spared, because these
people, as innocent as they look, act as
spies for tbe insurgents in Pinar del Rio."
He also said that it was a necessity of
war to destroy the whole province, burn
ing every building which may be made a
shelter for the insurgents and every plan
tation which may give them food.
"Tbe Spanish soldiers," added Weyler,
"have all their provisions from Havana,
while the insurgents need to live on what
they find in the country. Not a single ani
mal, not even a rat, will be left to Maceo
if it can be helped."
The plan of campaign of General Wey
l?r has thus been changed. He shrinks
from attacking Maceo in his strongholds,
yet it is doubttul if he can realize this
plan better than the other, for Maceo bas
provisions enongh for one year, and in
December General Gomez wiil start again
on bis march to the west. Maceo is also
well provided with arms and ammunition
received from recent expeditions.
There is no foundation for the rumor
that General Gomez will make at present
any effort to assist Maceo in Pinar del
Rio, as Maceo can lake care of himself in
the chain of mountains known as Sierra
de Ar*anos. Gomez is preparing his
march for December.
This is not the right time for him to
stort, becauso he might sacrifice uselessly
men and ammunition needed to interfere
with ti.e harvest in December. He wiil
carry with bira the avenging torch and
will not leave a single sugar-cane field
wnich may yield a direct or indirect reve
nue to the Spanish Government.
Nothing like an attack on Havana can
be expected for the present. The real sit
uation is that Spain is unable to oveicome
tbe revolution and pacify the island, a'
though with her army of 125,000 soldiers
and 00.000 volunteers and a strong navy
she can still bold her fortified cities and
seaport. No end is seen, therefore, if the
United States does not interfere to stop
this butchery. Spain may figiit to her last
man and the Cubans will die before they
will surrender their cause.
The cruelties imposed upon American
citizens and Cuban political prisoners in
the fortress of Cabanas are terrible. Not
withstanding all the promises made by
the Spanish to the American Government
the condition of these prisoners is worse
than ever. Their families are not allowed
to visit them in tbe prison. They are un
able to send a line to tbe United States.
Whoever attempts to approach within six
varda of tbe gates risks instant death.
Their food is bad, and what is more ter
rible, they are in a constant agony, ex
pecting death from one moment to
another, as any day may bring them the
news of their death sentence.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 30.â Chairman
Cragin has called a meeting of the Cuban
relief committee of 100 for next Friday to
discuss the advisability and means of
floating $1,000,000 of the Cuban republic"
bonds in Chicago. If the committee de
cides favorably Senor Estrada Palma will
be advised, and he will offer the bonds on
tbe local market, coming to tbe city for
that purpose, T_here were numerous ap
plicants at Chairman Cragin's office to
day for volunteer service in Cuba, but no
encouragement was given them, except to
a former lieutenant in the United States
army, who was told to communicate w ith
General Palma.
JACKSONVILLE, Fia., Nov. 30.â
Colonel Emilio Nunez, the Cuban patriot,
will remain here tbis week and appear in
the United States court next Monday to
answer to the charge of aiding and setting
on foot the expedition against Spain
alleged to have been taken cut by the
steamer Laurada. Since being here last
Colonel Nunez has been tried in New York
for virtually the same offense. The trial
resulted in the disagreement of the jury,
and it is possible that the case may be .
nolle prossed.
HAVANA, Cuba, Nov. 30.â N0 news
concerning the movements of Captain-
General Weyler later than that sent in
these dispatches yesterday has been re
ceived. He was then reported to be
marching westward from San Cristobal in
searcli of the rebel forces. No insurgents
had been met. The Spaniards captured a
number of stray cattle and destroyed a
rebel plantation and huts.
There is nothing to indicate the where
abouts of Maceo's command, but it is
thought that it is retreating before the ad
vance of General Weyler.
The war bulletins issued at the palace
to-day were unimportant. They only re
port skirmisties. in which the losses on
either side were trifling.
Rebels to-day blew up a bridge near
Zeiba Mocba, province of Matanzas, while
a train was passing over it. The armored
car attached to the train was wrecked and
one soldier wounded.
Thus far 278 members of the Manigo
Society, which is made up of criminals
and rulfians of every description, have
been exiled to the African penal colonies.
This society was very active toward and
after the close of the ten years' war, and
its members have taken every advantage
of the present condition of affairs to com
mit all manner of crimes. The authorities
are making every effort to extirpate them.
An order has been issued by the local
treasury to prevent the exportation of
tobaccco grown in tbe provinces of Pinar
del Rio and Havana from the ports of the
other provinces.

BURNED IN THE DOCK.
Destruction of the Steamer City of Kala
mczoo and the Loss of Several
Lives.
FENNVILLE, Mich., Nov. 30.â The
steamer City of Kaiamazoo, lying at her
dock at South Habor, caught fire early
this morning and was entirely destroyed.
The steamer belonged to the Williams
Transportation Company, but had been
drawn off her recular route and laid up
for the winter. She was moored at her
dock a week ago, but tbe crew had not yet
been discharged.
How Ine fire originated is not known,
but as the weather has been cold and fires
have been kept up to warm tbe men it is
probable that it came from an overheated
pipe. Tba fire broke out about 4 o'clock
this morning, when all the workmen were
asleep. Before they could be aroused the
flames had gained such headway that they
could not be suppressed. Two of the crew,
Robert Vanostrand and Joe Lang, firemen,
were burned to death.
The stewardess has not been seen since
the fire, and, as it was known that she was
on the boat when the fire broke out, it is
almost certain that she, too, perished in
the flames. The loss on the steamer is
$40,000, and it will bo total, as the insur
ance on her hnd expired.

OLD GLORY WAS
TRIPLED UPON
DoubtS Cast in Reference
to Olney's Recent
Assertion.
Evidence That the American Flag
Was Torn Down and Houses
Looted at Hisdeny.
Spencer Trask Willing to Believe the
Statements Made by Dr. Grace
Kimbalf.
NEW YORK, N. V-, Nov. 30.-B. Hago
pian, a prominent American citizen who
lives at 80 Ninety-second street, this city,
has made a statement casting doubts
upon assertions of Turkish respect for the
American flag. He is a native of Turkey,
having been born in Hisdtny, which is a
few miles distant from Constantinople.
"It is surprising," said Hagopian, "to
see Secretary Olney denying that insults
were committed by the Turks on the
American flag at the recent massacre at
Haskeny. Tne truth is that an American
house was looted and ti.e American flag
was torn down and trampled under foot."
He received a letter from Miss M. J.
Logan, the American lady whose house
was looted, which is as follows:
'â¢Your sister and her two daughters are
safe. Haskeny was the point that suffered
mostly. The place is utterly deserted,
and I ara trying to help the poor people,
but it is an endless undertaking; they are
so destitute of everything, and it is most
pitiful to see them, they are so afraid. I
am ashamed that England and America
stand by and let such dreadful deeds of
cruelty be done when they could stop it if
they would. Our house was looted of
everything and our flag torn down and
trampled under foot. lam sure this can
not go on much longer. Sincerely yours,
"M. J. Gleasox."
"Secretary Olney," continued Hago
pian, "is reported as saying that Ameri
can women were not attacked in Constan
tinople. That is true; the Turks had
orders not to attack women in that city.
They did not spare them, however, in
Armenia. My sister's house in Haskeny
was looted. It is near Miss Gieason's,
and she and her two daughters fled to
Miss Gieason's house for protection. My
nieces sought shelter under the American
flajj, and that flag was torn do\v:i and
trampled under loot, while the house it
should have protected was looted."
Spencer Trask, who is chairman of the
executive committee of the National
Armenian Relief Committee, says that he
had every confidence in the word of Dr.
Grace KiniDall, whose statement regard
ing the Turkish treatment of the Ameri
can flag has recently been called to ac
count by Secretary Olney.
"lam willing to back up Dr. Kimball,
Dr. Vvashburn and all those American
missionaries in all they have said," he
addeJ. "They have noi spoken one whit
more strongly than the facts justify. I
am willing to take Dr. Kimball's word
anainst any one's. It is a fact that no re
dress has been made for the losses of the
missionaries in Turkey, which amount to
more than $100,000. Although constant
demands have been made on the Turkish
Government, nothing whatever has been
accomplished, nor da I believe it will be
under the present Minister for Turkey. I
do not think our Government has taken
the right position in the matter. It has
been very weak. Furthermore, I think
that Terrell is not the proper person for
the place. In fact, our country has not
been properly represented. If we had had
a different sort of a man In Constanti
nople I think that many of these griev
ances would have been prevented. As to
the actual state of things, I think Dr.
Hamlin, who founded Robert College and
has lived there for nearly forty years, is
certainly more competent to express an
opinion on the subject than any one who
has never been there."
" BUCKET - SHOP" MEN GUIL TY.
Successfully Prosecuted at Chicago
Through Their Violation of the
Postal Laws.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 30.â The first case
in this city in which "bucket-shop 1 ' pro
prietors have been successfully prosecuted
by means of the postal laws came up be
fore Judge Grosscup in the United fetates
District Court to-day. William Me-
Clure, Dr. James Craig, James F. Mc-
Clure, John I. Talmaun and William A.
Thomas, who were indicted this term at
the instance of the Civic Federation for
using the mails to promoteja scheme to
defraud, appeared in court with their at
torney, ex- Judge Scott, and entered a
plea of guilty.
The men were arrested last July, after
doing a profitable business, and others
were caught in the same net by Postoffice
Inspector Stuart. The indictments were
based on a letter to customers. Attorney
Scott admitted that the trade had not
been made on the Board of Trade, but it
was a bucket-shop trade.
District Attorney Black, for the Govern
ment, recommended a fine of $1000 in
each case, and said he was satisfied that
the men, if they had at one time 'made
money, were now poor. In another
court the defendants said they had not
continued their business after their arrest.
The District Attorney informed the
court there were other similar cases to be
called next month, and he recommended
a fine of $1000 in each case. The Judge
will pronounce sentence to-morrow
morning.
GARROTED ON A STREET CAR.
Peter Brosseau Relieved of a Wallet Con
taining Notes and Mones Amount
ing io $3000.
CHICAGO, 111.. Nov.- 30.â Peter Bros
seau, a commission merchant at 150 Ex
change building, Union Stock-yards, was
held up and robbed of $3000 on a Halstead
street electric car at Twenty-ninth street
this morning. Charles Mathusek, who
stole the wallet containing 1 the money,
was arrested after a severe struggle and
was locked up at the Thirty-tifth-street
station, but two companions who aided
him snatched the pocket-book wbiie
Mathusek was struggling WJth his captors,
jumped from the car and escaped. The
pocket-book contained $2500 in checks,
nearly one-half of which are made pay
able to bearer, and $100 in cash, iiros
yean was on iiis way downtown for the
purpose of depositing the money. At
Twenty-ninth street the three robbers
crowded him against the door and Mathu
sek put his hand into his victim's inside
vest pocket and pulled out the wallet. At
the same time oie of the robbers held bis
arm across Brossau's throat and prevented
him from moving or making an outcry.
The conductor realizing what was going
on rushed at Mathusek and threw him on
the rloor. One of the other two then
snatched the pocket-book from Mathu
sek's hand and both escaped. Mathusek
was taken before Justice Hall at the Thir
ty-fifth-street station and held to the Grand
Jury.
TO TAP GOLD FIELDS.
Canada Expects to Construct ,a : System,
of Railroads.
ST. PAUL, r Minn., Nov. 30.â L.: H.
Davies, Canadian Minister of Fisheries
and Marine, -passed through the city
yesterday on his way to Vancouver,
where the Bering Sea Commission session
is now in progress. He was accompanied
by A. G. Blair, Minister of Railways and
Canals, and others. ' â  '
All but Blair take part in the Bering
sea proceedings. Blair gees to Leth
bridge, N. W. T., to " inspect the proposed
route forming an } extension of the Can
adian Pacific to Crow's Nest Pass and into
the mining territory of Canada. His" mis
sion is connected with the discovery of
immense gold fields in British Columbia,
which has induced .the Canadian govern
ment to - undertake an extensive investi
gation of that country.
This investigation comprehends the tap
ping of the great gold fields of Southern
British Columbia"by a complete system of
railway lines in one of the most tortuous
regions for railroad building in the world.
The new lines will connecr directly with
the Canadian Pacific- Railway and will put
the gold mines ana the hundreds of thou
sands of acres of rich bituminous coal
lands in direct connection with the great
Northwestern trunk lines. The under
taking involves an expenditure of some
$8,000,000. ' . , â  i

FIGURES ON BULL- FIGHTING.
Immense Sums Earned by the Torea
dores Muring the Past Season.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 30.â The
Sun's Madrid correspondent sends the
following: The newspapers devoted to
bull;figuting publish some interesting de
tails in reference to tue past season.
Guerita is the king of the toreadores. He
earned $61,200 during the season from
April 5 to October 30. Next after his
came Keverte, with $28,700; Mazzantini,
$26,600; Bembita, with $-.'5,000; Algabeno,
with $23,000; Fuentes, with $19,500; Mi
nuto. with $15,600, and Villita, with
$10,000. Asa comparison, Premier Cano
vas' salary is $5400 a year.
There were during the season 438 per
formances, in whicu 1218 bulls, worth
$300,000, were killed. Over 6000 horses
perished in the fights. These rigures in
clude only the high-class bull-fighting at
the most important cities. In each of the
smaller towns they have every year one or
two tights in which the number of persona
killed or crippled always exceeds that of
the bulls fought.
BELOW THE RESERVE.
Failure 0/ a Missouri Bank Because of
Short Funds.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 30.â The
Missouri National Bank, one of the larg
est banks in this city, closed its doors to
day and is in charge of H. A. Foreman,
National Examiner. The failure was due
to the money on hand running Below the
reserve required under the banking laws
and the papers among the assets being
given a lower value by Examiner Fore
man tlian by the bank officials. The offi
cers of the institution say they will pay
depositors in full.
The failure created great surprise, as
the bank was generally understood to be
in a sound condition. The last statement,
made October 6, showed resoutces of
$1.875,537 24. The capital is $250,000. Ex
aminer Foreman says the condition of the
bank is practically the seme to-day as on
October 6. The only difference is in tie
value of some of its assets. No trouble is
anticipated at any of the other Kansas
City banks.
AO BULLETS WERE FOUMf.
So There Is Mystery Surrounding the
Burning of Perkins' Store.
CHARLESTON, S. C, Nov. 30.â Early
ibis morning a fruitsiore belonging to
Charles Perkins was discovered to be on
fire. The firemen found Perkins inside
the place with five wounds in his head
and in an unconscious condition. Tbe
shop was totally destroyed. Perkins re
gained consciousness during the day and
said that two. men entered his shop while
be was asleep and one of them shot him
with buckshot and then robbed him. No
shot was beard by the neighbors and the
money had not been touched in the cash
dvawer. The physicians have found no
bullets or buckshot in Perkins' head. Th>)
case is surrounded in mystery, and many
people believe that a Roman candle or
one of the skyrockets, many of which
were in the shop, must have gone off,
hitting Perkins in the head and setting
the place on lire.
IOWA'S GROWING DEFICAT.
For the First Time Sine* the War lowa
Will lÂ«*ii? llondt.
DES MOINES, lowa, Nov. 30.â The
State of lowa has a deficit, of $500,000 in
sight. By trie end of tbe present biennial
period it is liable to reach nearer to $1,000,
-000, and it seems altogether probable the
State will have to issue bonds for the first
time since the war.
Members of the Legislature have re
cently held conferences with State officers,
and the result is that an earnest effort will
be made at the special session in January
to bring the revenue laws before the Legis
lature 'or a general revision. The present
system is so inequitable, and some coun
ties pay twice as much tax per acre on
land as others, although the market value
is the tame. Personal property almost
entirely escapes taxation. State institu
tions are seriously embarrassed and the
situation is gettine worse constantly.

NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 30. -It has
been reported from time to time that John
Philip Sousa, the well-known bandmaster 1
ana composer of march music, would be
come leader of the Seventh Regiment
band. Frank Christianer, who looks after
Sousa' s business affairs, said that no such

none would be made, adding: "Mr. Sousa
will start on a six months' concert tour,
opening in Philadelphia in January, and
he will go as far west as California, south
to New Orleans and north to Prince Ed
ward Island. He has a great mass of
business on band besides this. He has
Jtwt about completed a march, and Lj
working on a new opera. He could not

be demanded."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1896.
SERIOUS SPREAD
OF THE STORMS
Northern Pacific Trains
Are Stuck in the Snow
Drifts.
Small Towns in the North Cut
Off From Supplies and Dis-
tress Will Ensue.
There Is Much Apprehension in Re
gard to the Cattle Inlustry in
Montana-
FARGO. N. Dak., Nov. 30.â Fuller re
ports of the late storm show it to have
been far more serious than was at first
supposed. The drifts in cuts are six to
fourteen feet deep and are frozen like ice
mixed with sand. Dynamite is being
used to loosen up the snow. The south
western branch of the Northern Pacific to
Lisbon and Edgley is still frozen up and
people in the towns along the line are out
of wood and coal and there seems no
prospect of opening the roads for three or
four days. Small towns along the main
line of the Northern Pacific are out of
fuel. In a wreck of a snowplow thiÃ
morning, John Tallman, a fireman, had a
leg broken, his head scalded and received
serious internal Injuries.
BISMARCK, N. Dak., INov. 30.â The
Northern Pacific is still blockaded. Its
train which should have reached Minne
apolis on Thursday is stuck in a snow
dritt forty miles weit of here and cannot
move until a snow plow clears tbe track.
In some deep cuts the snow is drifted on
the track to a depth of fifty feet. A coal
famine prevails here and then* will be
much suffering unless relief is afforded at
once.
HELENA, Moxt., Nov. 30.â There is
much apprehension in regard to the cattie
industry this winter. The severity of the
weather for the past four .ays and the
fact that there is considerable snow on
the ranges are ominous for future lossers.
STEPHEN, Minx., Nov. 30.â Passenger
trains have been stucic in snowdrifts in
the late storm. Engineers and firemen
have had to shovel enow all night in the
worst blizzard experienced here for years
in order to keep the engines alive. Al
though but a short distance from the
water-tank they were unable to reach it.
Engineer Winney's engine ran down to
the tank for water and fuel with the cars
only 1000 feet away. The storm filled the
track behind them and engineer and fire
man were compelled to stay at the tank.
No one dares trust himself in the weather
and during the entire night the two men
shoveled snow into tbe tender in the hope
of getting back. In ten Hours they suc
ceeded in getting back. They suffered
greatly from the cold.
CHIPPEWA i^ALLS, Wis., Nov. 30.â
The Chippewa RiVeT is backing up on to
the streets in the lower section of the
city. Its rise is due to a large-, ice gorge
formed eight miles below, near Eau
Claire. All basements on River and
Spring streets are filled with water, and
residents and occupants of business
places on River street are moving out.
The ice gorge is four .miles long and
twenty feet high. Five hundred men are
at work with dynamite endeavoring to
break it. The intense cold retards the
work and new ice is forming rapidly. Un
iess the gorge is broken inside of twenty
four hours great disaster is feared.
MOOREHEAD, Minn., Nov. 30.â Tbe
body of Thomas Anderson, who perished
in Thursday's storm, was found this morn
ing half a mile northeast of ttie home of
Miss Daniels, whom he escorted home
from work Thanksgiving night. His coat
was missing. Anderson was 16 years old.
It was on his return home he lost his life.
BARNESVILLE. Minn., Nov. 30.âTraf
fic west of here has been completely
stopped for two days. An engine and
snowplow left here Sunday to open, the
line to Grand Forns. A large number of
freight and passenger trains are stalled
here, and in consequence the hotels are
reaping quite a harvest.
COMING TO CALIFORNIA.
Oreat Ruth of Chicago People to Reach
This Tinlmii Climate.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 30.â The cold
weather has had a perceptible effect on
California travel. Inquiries at the offices
of all tbe leading lines to-day developed
the fact that hundreds of Chicago people
are leaving for the Dalmy climate of the
Pacific Coast. Two lines say that all the
berth 3on two different trains wore en
gaged for to-night and reservations were
being received fas'. Some of the roads
are running tourist sleepers once a week,
while others send a car of that description
through seven days a week.
A man whose business it is to accom
pany California excursions says coast
travel began much earlier than usual this
year. Some of it in September. There
was a rush immediately after the election,
many citizens waiting to cast their ballots
before leaving. There were people at all
the ticket offices to-day lined up at the
counter buying tickets and reserving
berths.
Tbe competition among the different
lines is lively, some of them exhibiting
photographs of the inside of their tourist
cars- This seems to be meeting with gen
eral favor on account of the cheaper but
substantial accommodations offered.
GLASS MANUFACTURERS MEET.
The Association to Be Enlarged by Taking
More Factories Into Un Trust.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 30.â The
Glass Manufacturers' Association met here
to-day. Forty -nine factories through
Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania were rep
resented. H. H. Sellers McKee of Pitts
burg, president of the association, said
emphatically that the glass trusts have
not collapsed. He said: "All of these
rumors that the association had gone to
pieces are false. We are here to make ar
rangements for renewing our agreement.
The wage scale has been arranged. We
will renew pur agreement and the factories
wili start up December 15."
It was decided to reorganize the associa
tion on head lines. More factories will be
taken into the trust. It was also believed
thai; the prices of window glass will be
materially increased.
Forming a Gas Combine.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 30.â The four
companies composing what is known as
the gas trust of Chicago have prepared a
bill for presentation to the Legislature at
its session nest year granting them per
mission to consolidate. There is a statute'
at present in the way and that wouid have
to be repealed. It was upd this statute
that Attorney-General Maioney resisted
the attempt ot the companies some time
aeo to become one corporation legally.
The Ogden and Mutnal Fuel Gas com
panies are the only independent concerns,
and they will remain out of the combina
tion. The Ogden Company expects to
start operations the first of the year with
a capacity of 2,000,000 cubic feet.

BOSTON, ; Mass., Nov. 30.â 0- L. Con :
cannon, a materializing medium, caused
a riot at the First Spiritual Temple yester
day. The lights were turned down and a
figure stalked forth. /'At- that moment a
dozen young men jumped on the platform, 5
tore dawn the curtains and the cabinet
and revealed the medium. ' ' ; : ;
: There arose a shout ; from ' the believers
to attack : the raiders. A lively - fight was
already in progress on the platform, and
from the audience several scores of men
rushed forward to the "assistance of those
who had disturbed the performance. Wigs,
whiskers, white silk* 1 robes and other para
phernalia were found in the cabinet and
carried off â  by the ; raiders, whose progress
toward the lobby was fought inch by inch,
Mr. Concannon was hustled through a
rear door. The crowd howled as the row
progressed â¢: and sides ," were taken in the
fight. One man was kicked in the back
and others of .; the raiding party, which, it
was later ascertained, numbered: twenty
five," suffered blackened eyes and bruises,
fifteen policemen, in response to' a I call,'
cleared' the church. f At the : evening ser- j
vice fifty policemen were on 'duty â > inside
the temple to preserve order.- t ; ; . -
MME. NORDICA'S TOUR.
Looks Forward With Pleasure to Ber
Fi*lt in California.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 30.â Mme.
Nordica, who is at the Waldorf, has de
termined that there is no likelihood of her
singing in opera before her return to Eu
rope. She admits that Colonel Mapieson
has been in communication with her, but
says she has too many concert engage
meats to consider any proposition to ap
pear with his company.
"When I leave here next Saturday, " she
said, "I go on my Western tour. I will
sing in most of the large cities. In Chi
cago I appear with Thomas' orchestra,
and, by the way, I am going to sing in the
big Mormon temple in Salt Lake City. I
am on the programme for the ' Inflamma
tus,' I think, with a chorus of 500 Latter
day Saints.
"I am looking forward to my visit to the
Pacific Slope, as my tour includes San
Francisco and Los Angeles. When I leave
America in the spring I will go direct to
Paris. I have been asked to Bing at the
Grand Opera there, and may appear in
'Lohengrin' or -Lea Hugu nots.'"
TORTURED BY ROROLAND..
Fiend* Apply Fire to the Feet of an
Aged Woman.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 30.â Four masked
men entered the cottage of Mr. and Mrs. C.
Jacobsen, 11C6 Florence avenue, Evanston,
this morning Ht 2 o'clock, cruelly beat and
ill treated the two aged occupants and
nnally, by torture, endeavored to extract
irom the feeble old woman a confession of
the hiding-place which held the savings
of the household.
Unable even by the fiendish method of
fire applied to the bottom of her
bare feet to force Mrs. Jacobson
to divulge the secret, the robbers
bound ber and her husband, both of
whom were bleeding from brutaily in
flicted wounds, and cast them roughly into
a corner. where for tw*o hours
they endured the horror of lyiug
under the menacing gaze of a
pair of ruffians while the other two
ransacked every nook and corner of the
hovel in search of gold supposed to be
concealed within its walls. The robbers
found only a small amount of money.
DEATH ENDS A ROMANCE.
Passing of Sadie McDonald, Wjio Wan
Betrothed to a liord.
NEW YORK, N. V., Nov. 30. -A sensa
tion that would have shocked and scan
dalized the English nobility and pene
trated even to the circle of royalty was
averted by the su;lden death in Australia
last Sunday of Sadie McDonald.
Advices have been received from Mel
bourne to the effect that no less a person
age than the Earl of Shaftesbury had be
come enamoured of the frolicsome sou
brette, who for several months bad been
starring in the colonies in Hoyt's "A Trip
to Chinatown."
The announcement of their engagement
had been made at the clubs and in theat
rical circles, it was said, and color ha 1
been given to the story, according to the
rumor, by the fact that tne Earl had pre
sented her with diamond ornaments ag
gregating in value $50,000.
To Open the Jtintillerien.
CHICAGO, 111., Nov. 30.â Sam Rice,
president of the American Spirits Dis
tilling Company, who arrived in Chicago
to-day, declined to talk for publication
about the proposed trade agreement
among the distillers of the country. He
stated that one of the objects of his visit
West was to open a number, of the com
pany's distilleries, which have been closed
for several months. The Manhattan, at
Peoria, was started this morning, and sev
eral more at that and other points will be
opened in a short time. A meeting of
distillers is expected to be held in this
city this week to get all the concerns in
line if possible. It is said all the Cincin
nati houses, with possibly one exception,
have consented to join the pool.

CHAPMAN MUST
SERVE SENTENCE
Decision of the Supreme
Cpurt in a Celebrated
Case.
Penalty for Declining to Answer
the Questions of a Senate
Committee.
Other Contumacious Witnesses in the
Notorious Sugar Scandal Will
Be Tried.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 30.â 8y its
unanimous decision to-day, announced
by Chief Justice Fuller, the Supreme
Court of the United States practically
affirmed the judgment of the Court of Ap
peals of the District of Columbia in the
case of Elverton R. Chapman, the stock
broker who declines to answer certain
questions propounded by the Senate com
mittee investigating the famous sugar
trust rumors in connection with the con
sideration of the tariff bill in 1893.
, The effect of the decision is that Mr.
Chapman must surrender himself to serve
a term of thirty days' imprisonment, ad
judged against him upon conviction in
the District Cpun, and pay a fine of $100.
A collatera.l effect is that Messrs. Have
raeyer and Searles of the su ar trust and
Messrs. Edward and Shriver, the newspa
per correspondents, who also declined to
answer tbe questions propounded by the
Senate commute, will have to submit
themselves for trial in the District Courts
upon indictments similar to that in the
Chapman case.
The history of the case is familiar, hav
ing beon irequently narrated in these dis
patches. - Cii:irman was "convicted under
section 102, Rl-vised Statutes, which pro
vides punis ment for failure to answer
questions asked by a committee of Con
gress, the court overruling all suggestions
that the section was unconstitutional. He j
sued out a writ of error to have the case j
reviewed by the United States Supreme
Court and the Government moved to dis- |
m.ss the writ on the ground th.it the Su- I
preme Court had no jurisdiction 10 review
the judgment of the District Courts in
criminal cases.
The appellant, the Chief Justice said,
rested on an act of Congress an>i a proper
construction of the act of 1893 by the Dis
trict Court of Appeals was io be arrived
at in the liirht of previous decisions upon
similar statutory provisions. In the case
of the Unied States vs. Moore (decided in
1805), Chief Justice Marshall held that the
mi; reme Court of the United States had
no juiisdiction.
"Marshall said the words 'in dispute'
seem appropriate to civil cases when the
subject in contest has a value by the sum
mentioned in the act. But in criminal
cases the question js guilt or innocence of
the accused. And although he may be
fined upward of $l 0 0: yet that is. in the
eye of the law, a punishment for the
offense committed and not the particular
object of the suit." This construction of
the law was carried forward under subse
quent legislation and was affirmed in sev
eral decisions as to laws of March 8, 1891,
and February 6, 1839. The.eighth section,
of February 9, 18^3, and being the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia,
provides for the review by the Supreme
Court of the United Stares of any master
in dispute exceeding $5000 under the same
regulation as heretofore provided for in
writs of error or appeals from decrees
renaered in the Supreme Court of the
District of Columbia; and also in cases
without* regard to the sum in dispute
wherein is involved .the validity of any
patent or copyright, or of a treaty or stat
ute of or an authority exercised by the
United States.
This act and that of 1885, the Chief Jus
tice said, the court regarded as the same
in their meaning and legal effect. The
suggestion that aecause a tine of $100 was
involved the case could be reviewed by the
Supreme Court of the United States was
disposed of by the language oi Chief Jus
tice Marshall in the United States vb.
Moore. There was nothing, the opinion
continued, in the eighth section quoted
to justify its expansion so as to make the
provisions of the act of 1889, involving the
constitutionality of any statute of the
Unied States may be brought to the Su
preme Court from any district or circuit
in the Uniied States apply to the courts of
the District of Columbia. " No mention was
made in that act ol the Disuict Court.
The conclusion was that the writ of error
must be dismissed, and it was so ordered.
There yet remains to Chapman, bow
ever, tba right to apply for his release
after he shall have been placed in tbe
custody of the Marshal under the sen
tence of the District Court upen a writ of
habeas corpus, and the v. hole case will
then come up for review. He may file his
petition in the District Court, but, inas
much as that court has already practically
decided against him, he will be more
likely to go to the supreme Court of the
United Slates wkh an original action.
FIRE CLAIMS A HERO.
Army Chaplain Blaino Perishes in an
Attempt to Save His Daughter
From Flames.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 30.â A tel
egram was received at the War Depart
ment to-day from Major Burk. stationed
at Fort Ringgold, Tex., stating that last
night the quarters of the chaplain, Mal
colm C. Blame, were burned.
The chaplain and his daughter were
burned to dea th. Chaplain Blame, after
the fire had made some headway, missed
his daughter and entered the building to
rescue her. He was overcome by the
smoke and perished with his child. His
wife escaped without serious injury.
The circumstances surrounding the
death of the brave chaplain were very sad.
Before he entered the burning building
some bystanders tried to hold him. He
resisted, and said that he must savA his
child's life. They reasoned with him,
showing him that it was death to enter
the building. The man would not hear
them and, breaking away in a frenzy of
excitement, he rushed through the flames
into the house. His charred remains were
found near the entrance of the building.
Chaplain Blame was born in Kentucky
and enlisted as a private in Company H
with the Kentucky infantry in 1864. He
was discharged the next year and ap
pointed as post chaplain from Pennsylva
nia in June, 1880.

REPORT OF THE HYDROGRAPHER
much Work Accomplished in Establish
ing yautical Charts.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 30.-Thb
annual report of the hydrographer of the.
Navy Department for the past fiscal year
has been issued by the department. He
says: "The work of constructing nautical
charts has advanced to such a stage that
I am able to report that the set of general
ocean charts is complete, the set of gen
eral charts of tie Western Hemisphere is
practically complete, tne general coast
charts of China and Japan are practically
complete, and work is In progress on the
coast charts of Southern and Eastern
Alrica.
" An increase of $130,000 a year for five
years would enable the office to complete
its set of charts, after which the expense
of supplying the Government and mari
time community wiih the latest editions
would be comparatively slight."
The new method of filing and averaging
meteorological matter in the meteorologi
cal division has not been put on a wording
basis owing to discouragements of various
kinds, bur it is believed that that there
are no difficulties in the way that cannot
be easily surmounted.
At the request of the Government of
Guatemala surveys were made during the
tir->t months of 1896 by officers of the
United States ship Dolphin of Santo
Tomas and the apDroaches to Puerto
Berrios, of Port Livingston, and of the

Bad Habits Make a Man Act Like He
Mas Under a Spell.
A man will try to convince himself by
arguments so poorJy founded that if they
were presented by another they would be
treated with contempt. A3 an instance:
He may be ailing from the heavy poison
j of tobacco, or the lighter poison of coffee,
! the weakened condition will show some-
where in the body : eyes, head, stomach,!
heart, liver, bowels or somewhere. His
doctor tells him to stop the habit, but
each day the thought comes, "Oh, coffee
and tobacco don't hurt me; it's my
stomach that is at fault; I'll have that
cured and everything will be all right."
So he keeps on with his habits and goe-i
to drugging a poor old stomach that would
do its work beautifully if the master would
furnish enough vitality to run it, but he
yoisons his nervous system and robs the
members of strength to carry on their
work. When a man wakes up to what he I
is doing, exchanging hid health and chance :
to succeed in this world for a paltry habit i
or two, he quits them ana follows nature's j
wise laws.
It is easy to give up coffee if one can
have Postum, the food drink, which is a
facsimile in looks of line Mocha coffee.
In taste it retains a little pungency With
coffee, but has a distinct flavor of its own.
It is made entirely of pure grains and has
the ability to make red blood quickly.
Tobacco, morphine, whiskey, strychnine
and coffee each contain munh the same
roisonous alkaloids, but vary in strength.
Postum is a delicious breakfast drink. It
is fattening and nourishing, for it is made
of the grains intended by the Creator for
man's natural use and scientifically pre-
pared by tbe Postum Cereal Co., Lim. of
.Battle Creek, Mich.
.Beware of the fraudulent imitations of
the original Postum Cereal grain coffee.
Insist on Postum.

BLANCA COOLIES
Masked Men Drive Chinese
Employes From a
Cannery.
Armed With Shotguns, the Mob
Invades the Mongols'
Quarters.
Forces Eight lSlaat-Eyed Workmen to
Bi Carried Away in a
Wagon.
RIVERSIDE, Cal., Nov. 30.â The Chi
nese employed in the packing-houses at
Casa Blanca are thoroughly alarmed over
an affair which took place Sunday night
at 11 o'clock. Twenty white men, anne I
with shotguns and masked, visited the
packing-house conducted by the Fay Fruit
Company, and, breaking down the door of
the bouse in which the Chinese employed
by the company lived, commanded the
frightened Mongols â eight in number â to
pack up and leave. The mob stood guard
while the Chinese obeyed the order, and
as soon as the latter had completed the
picking of their belongings^ the evictors
I pelied them to get into a wagon which
rÂ£ad been provided for the purpose.
' The masked men then started the
wagon-load of Chinese toward Corona, the
vehicle being guarded all the time by the
armed mob. On reaching a point a short
distance this side of Corona the Chinamen
were unceremoniously unloaded upon the
prairie. Their captors then warned them
to leave and not to return, under penalty
of death. The Chinese spent the night
where they were lel\ and returned to Casa
Blanca to-day.
As soon as word of the affair reached the
authorities officers were sent out to inves
tigate, but the proceedings Mad been so
quietly planned and carried out that noth
ing that would lead to the identification
of any of the evictord was learned. The
Chinamen claim, in fact, that they believe
the scheme was one of robbery more than
an effort to drive them away, for they say
that the mob took all the money, watches
and other valuables found in the camp.
For years past there has existed consid
erable feeling here against the employ
ment of Chinese in the packing-hordes,
but this is the first time that anything
mor? than talk has resulted. The Chinese
eav they intend to stay and work, aud the
officers lear that more trouble will follow.
Tbe recent nard times have made many
laboring men desperate.
ENGLAND PRESENTS NEW CLAIMS.
Wanis This Government to Pay Costs In- I
curred in the Say ward Seizure
Case.
VICTORIA, B. C. Nov. When the
Bering Sea Claims Commission met this I
morning, Dickinson stated that they had
already filed answers in the first case, and !
others would be put in as soon as they J
were ready for the nrinters. . Dickinson j
went on to state that he had filed, a mo- j
tion to dismiss No. 26. being for $62,827 12 j
for costs' in the Say ward case. The ground |
for the motion was that the costs were in- i
curred by the Canadian Government and j
k^-ot by individuals, and, therefore, the j
did not come before the Commis- j
sioners within the terms of the "conven- j
tion. In case His friends on the opposite j
side intended to press the claim, he would i
ask for an. adjournment vending an an- |
swer from li is Government. â ~
Peters expressed surprise that the j
motion should be made, and said he cer- |
tainly intended to press the claim. The i
rum named was paid actually by the J
Canadian Government, which, so. far as ,
the tribunal wan concerned, was by the â 
British Government.
Dickinson stated that such a claim as ;
this had no more right to be put in than â 
would a claim for .the costs of either \
Government before the Paris tribunal. j
Costs incurred by individuals might be j
put in, but not costs incurred by either j
Government. They were excluded by the
terms of the convention.
Peters was satisfied to let the matter
sand over, as suggested, and further pro- I
posed that judgment be delayed in the i
Black Diamond and James Gaudin motion j
until he had heard from Sir Julian Paunce- j
lote, to whom he had wired, and who
would interview Secretary of State Oiney. '
Justice King then annoudced that noth- j
ing further would be done in re the Say- j
ward costs until counsel again mentioned |
it. It was arranged to take up the Caro- j
lina case at 10:30 o'clock on Wednesday
morning. .. j
The trial of the Queen versus the ;
schooner Ainoka commenced this morn

HelmoKen, Q. 1 C., for the defense. The !
AinoKa is a Victoria sealing schooner, j

the Bering Sea award act of 1896.

ANCATA DAMAGE SUIT.
r Action Brought by a- Victim of the Mad
JAcer Bridge Disaster.
EUREKA, Cal., Nov. 30.â Christopher j
Dagnin. a youth of Arcata, was until re- j
cently supposed to have been one of the i
only two passengers on the Arcata and I
Mad River Railroad train who escaped
unhurt from.the wreck at the Mad River j
bridge last September, but recent develop- i
merits ohow that Louis Everding, _ the
other lucky passenger, will enjoy that dis
tinction alone. For a week or more young i
Dagniu divided honors with Everding, I
when in an unlucky moment doctors dis- I
covered that he bad two ribs broken and
had sustained concussion of the, spine.. ,
For these injuries Susan Gibbons, his j
guardian, this afternoon commenced suit j
against th# Arcata and Mad River Rail- j
road Comrany for $5000. â¢
This makes the sixth suit against the j
company growing out of the bridge disas- i
ter and an aggregate of $54.300 is asked for. !

Sentenced From Fresno.
JIiLSNO, Cal., Nov. 30.â Joe Lopez,
who pleaded guilty to charges of burglary
n few days ago, was to-day sentenced by
Judge Church to serve five years at San
Quentin. He showed undue anxiety to
plead guilty, aud this caused an inyesti
cation into his history. It developed that
he committed forgery in this city several
ye^rs ago. He succeeded in eluding the
officers, although they made a vigorous
search for him at the time. He is an ex
convict.

STUCKTON MEN ANGRY.
Claim They Were Treated Unfairly in
the Thanksgiving Ttau Hey alt a.
. STOCKTON, Cal., Nov. 30.â There are a
lot of disgruntled oarsmen in Stockton,
and their friends are likewise indignant at
what they declare was shabby treatment
of the Stockton men at the hands of the
managers of the regatta on Thanksgiving
day and the finish of the races on Sunday
in San Francisco. The; local oarsmen are
bitter toward the South End crew. Against
Bob McArthur and Carson they have not
much to say, but at the rest of the South
Ends they are directing complaints.
It is understood here that some of the
men of the University aud Alameda Row
ing Club crews admitted after the race
that neither crew rounded the stakeboat.
This, if true, gave the Alain cd&s at least
four lengths the best of it on the home
stretch.

SACRIFICED BY
FAITH-CISTS
Medical Assistance Denied
a Dying Woman at
Stockton.
Prayer Her Only Remedy as She
Is Slowly Succumbing to
Fever.
Vain Appeal of a Father to Save His
Daughter and Her
Babe.
STOCKTON, Cal.. Not. 30.-At 1404
East Hazleton avenue a young mother
lies dying of a fever. Her life, it is said,
is a sacrifice to religious fanaticism, for
she has been surrounded by a band of
praying people who would not allow a
physician to be called nor make known
ber condition to her own father.
This woman, wlio is about 20 years old i
and has been married a little less than a j
year, is the wife of George R. Hawker, a
young man employed at whatever work
offers itself. He has been an attendant at
the Munro meetings, &a has also the young
lady's mother. Both are ardent believers
in the faith cure, but the young woman,
according to Alexander H. Quain, her
father, is not. According to the father of
the sick woman she has not received med
ical treatment since the birth of her baby
boy. Said he :
"Before morning my daughter will be
dead, I have not the least doubt, and her
death will be charged to fanatics who
have been surrounding her, and who, in
stead of giving her some substantial treat
ment or calling in a doctor, have done |
nothing more than furnish a little lime
juice In water, depending on faith to effect
a cure. At her sido lies a baby boy eleven
days o!d, who, I suppose, has been drink
ing in the germs of the typhoid fever that
has brought the mother to death's door,
and, of course, he will, in all likelihood,
be ttje next one."

SAN JOSE, Cal., Nov. 30.â John P.
Kelly, who made an attempt to murder ;
his wife and kill himself last Saturday i
morning, is still alive, and his condition!
shows little change except that at inter- \
vals he appears to be delirious. There is
not much sign of fever, however, the tem
perature being little above normel and the j
pulse is strong and regular. The I
physicians are confident that Kelly will
not die for several days, at least, with the
chances that after that he may rally and
partially recover.
"While in a semi-conscious, state Kelly
often calls for his wife by her given name,
"Annie." and at these times he declares
that he can hear her voice upstairs. He i
evidently imagines that he is still at bis !
jewelry store instead of being at the police i
receiving hospital. , â¢â â  .-
Mrs. Kelly's condition showed a decided
improvement to-day, her appetite - being
very good and other, conditions favorable
for her recovery. The bnllet in i her side
has not yet been located, but it is not be
lieved that there is any internal hemor- j
rhage, as in that case there would have 1
been decided sinking spells or death would
have resulted.

GUST OF WIND
UPSETS A STAGE;
| Peculiar Disaster to ' the
Julian and Foster
Coach.
Overturned by a Gale and
Thrown Into a Tangle of
Barbed Wire.
I
Its Driver Is Frightfully Torn and ]
Gashed, and His D.atli Is
Expected.
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Nov. 30.â A queer
| accident occurred to the Julian stage this
| morning, on the run down between Julian
i and Foster, and it resulted in a frightful
i^injury to Lee Green, the driver. There
: were no passengers and the morning was
coid, so Green was driving along at a
lively jog, running down toe slope from
i the foot of the Julian grade to the Santa i
Isabel store. Coming out upon the slope
from the narrow mouth of the canyon
| leading to the grade a strong wind was en
i countered. It increased in force as the
stage swept down the valley. There were
| four horses attached to the coach, which is
i a huge vehicle of the Concord pattern. It
was Jopheavy, because tbe mails were on
top and there were no passengers inside to
serve as ballast.
At a turn in the road a sudden gust
cuught the big stage on a balance and
blew it over, throwing Green half under it
and into a tangle of barbed wire. The ;
I horses plunged nnd strnggled to get free, !
while Green, scared half to death by the
prospect of being cut to pieces, tried to
j crawl out from under the stage. Dunne
1 all the scramble and confusion, however,
\ he pluckily held to the reins and pre
j vented tne horses from running away.
j They came to a standstill soon at\d Green,
apparently bleeding to death, managed to
make his way down to the Santa Isabel
store. The sta.ee was badly wrecked and
it was left tit Santa Isabel, a waeon con
veying the nails and tbe wounded driver j
to Ramona.
Green was frightfully cut about the
head, face and right shoulder. It is
feared his wounds are mortal, and that !
i even if he recovers he will loss an eye and
i an ear.
COLLISION AT UARVANZA.
Tiro Electric Car* Crash Together and \
Injure Pansengers.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 30.-
Through the carelessness or incompeten
cy of some one unknown to the
management of the Pasadena and Santa
I Monica Electric Railway, with head
quarters in this city, a collision occurred
at Garvanza about 6 o'clock to-night. The
disaster was caused by a misplaced switch.
j Garvanza is tbe meeting pqint of the Pas
| adena and Los Aneeles cars.
Tbe incoming car to this city runs onto
i tbe siding at that point, but in this in-
I stance it came straight ahead, colliding
i with thecar for Pasadena while both Were
: in motion.
The concusÂ«ian was terrific, and owinir
to t'.ie crowded condition of both cars it
was only by tha greatest good fortune thnt
a large number of persons were not fatally
| injured. As it was a number were badly
I cut by broken glass and otherwise'hurt.
Colonel John D. Frost, a Chicago capital
ist, suffered fractures of the right leg in
two places, and G. W. Frost of Los
Angeles had a foot badly crushed. Both
cars were wrecked.
ICE.-BOUND ON THE COLUMBIA.
! The Trans-Paelflc Steamship Altmorr
Held just by Floes.
KALAMA, Wash., Nov. 30.â The Ore
j gon Railway and Navigation Company's
â  chartered steamer Altmore is fast in the
I ice in the Columbia River, opposite
I Kalama.
The Altmore arrived at Astoria yester
sday, twenty-nine d.ays from Yokohama,
with a light cargo. Last evening it left
j for Portland, and should have arrived
j there early this morning.
It was seen early this forenoon laboring
I in the ice, which was moving slowly down
! stream In great floes, many of which were
1 piled on top of each other.
The floes pressed against the steamer's
sides^ith great force, and while it wa3
not injured l'ears were expressed by rivtr
men that it might be if the floes from up
j river become much larger.
Later the steamer wn-j turned broadside
| in the stream and drifted slowly with tbe
I current toward Astoria. Some believe
} mat Ice got clogged in its condenser-nipes
i and temporarily prevented the use of the
I engines,
i At dark the Altmore was still in the
river below Gobie, having been over
ivrenty-four hours trying to make Port
land.
Knilroad men who came from Portland
to-day spy that fifty stevedores apoeared
this morning at tue Pacific Coast dock to
unload the Alimore,
They waited for several hours and then
returned home. Once or twice the Alt
more had tronble in coming up the river
on account of low water.
Steamer men nre ueainning to regard it
as an unlucky boat, at least while navi
gating through the Columbia. J
News com.es from Vancouver, Washing
ton, that the BtÂ«<am ferry-boat Vancouver
is lying at its slip with ice packed tightly
all around it. Several unsuccessful at
tempts were made to-day to back it out j
and get it to a place less daneerou?. The !
steamship's position is a perilons oup.
The barkentino Eurek.", Captain Panl
son, anchored in midstream at Van
couver, panly laden with lumber for San i
Francisco, is surrounded by ice and con- '
sidered in a dangerous position. It is ex
pected the river will be frozen over solidly
opriosit* 1 that city by to-morrow morninir.

Â£ THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL. ~
Trade lively while the weather is good.
We have a week to prophesy about Con
gress before it meets.
The money problem will stay with us
until after New Year's at any rate.
We can never get a really good move
ment on local business without street im
provement.
Some people call this bracing weather
and some say it is the kind that makes a
fellow need a bracer.
The discussion on tax reform will prob
ably wait the meeting of the Legislature,
but it is bound to come.
There are over 1400 bills before Congress,
but on March 4 it will get ahead of them
and leave them behind it.
The fellows who prophesied an early
winter are now keeping themselves warm
with a glow of satisfaction.
The sympathy of our climate with that
of the East is not enough for us to shake
with them, but we can shiver a little.
The reports of ihe severe cold wave in
the East scund lik- exaggerations in many
respects, but they seem to be frozen facts.
â¢
Reports of Cabinet selections continue
to come in, but we doubt if McKinley will
give all the pudding away before Christ
mas.
The gold-standard cranks of the East are
beginning to understand that it was Bryan
ism that was voted down and not bimetai
iism.
As the blizzard season has started in
very early in the East we may expect the
tourist season for California to start in
early also.
Senator Mantle declares he will stand
in for the appointment of a Secretary of
Mines and Mining and the good work
grows in favor.
The interior papers are all in harmony
on one thing; they are ringing the
changes on coming prosperity like a
ctiime of joy bells.
Tire situation as regards Cuba- and the
funding bill are just exactly right for
Grover to make two scoops in his message
if ne had any sense.
The good roads movement has started
up-Hgain in al! the progressive States and
California will have to move rapidly ii she
keeps up with the procession.
Great Britain is not the only country
that prefers isolation in European diplo
macy. Kussia has a lone band herself
and intends to play it that way.
The friends of Cuba in Congres3 will not
be inactive this winter, and if Weyler has
any intention of making that decisive
blow he had better (. et it in at once.
The only way for Cleveland to make
himself solid with the people for the rest
of his administration is to thaw out his
frigidity in regard to Cuban independence.
Get your holiday trading done early and
later on you can go downtown and watch
the late purchasers crowd and crush and
have all the enjoyment of a free football
game.
Cleveland ha 3 bad the satisfaction of
teing cheered in Massachusetts and if he
will new siend up :or the Nicrrapua canal
aivi knock out the funding bill he will be
cheered in California.
The wonderful X ray was -discovered in
Europe, but its greatest developments
have been made in America, and thus we
liaveanoiher proof that we can beat the
Old World at anything it can start.
It is a-scrted by Wa-hington experts
that since tbe war Cabinet positions have
not been healthy for Presidential booms,
and that con?equrntly no man who
aspires to the Presidency will accept a I
seat at the council board of McKinley.
Even the flippant fellows navt qu it |
joshing the airsh.p story, and every one j
is now waiting ior the explanation of the
remarkable lights seen flying about the

-witness to the appearance of the light
makes it certain there is no hoax in the '
matter.
Morocco is not the place one would look

In Buncombe County, N. C, one of
the Republican candidates in the re
cent ejection \va- named Candler, but on
a number of tickets it was printed
Chandler. The election officials threw out
the misspelled ballots and counted in the
Democratic candidate. He, however, has
refused to accept the office on tne ground
that the voters clearly intended to elect
his competitor. We must, therefore,
score one for Buncombe, and remember
af;er tins that Buncombe County politics
is a good deal better than th at of some
other counties that brag more.
JUDGE M IKENNA'S DECISION.
The long-awaited decision of Judge Mc-
Kenna in the case involving the powers
and dutes of our State RaJroad Commis
sion has been handed down at last and
will be found fully reported in the local
columns of The Call. So far as tne out
come of this case has been expected to set
at rest the question as to whether the
freight and fare schedules of the Southern
Pacific Company are reasonable the de
cision of Judge McKenna will be a dis
tinct di appointment to the people of Cali
fornia. Its only effect is to decide that
the attempted action of the Railroad Com
mission which led to the interference of
the Federal courts was illegal In so far as
it attempted to effectuate a positive and
present reduction in grain rates.
Wnen the present Railroad Commission
entered upon the discharge of its duties'
somewhat less than two years ago and an
nounced its intention to make material
reductions in the schedules of the South
ern Pacific Company, The Call endeav
ored to suggest to it the legal limits of its
authority and to indicate the procedure
which would render its decision safe in
the event of an appeal on the part of the
railroad to the Federal court. We then
insisted that the Railroad Commission
was a leeal body invesie 1 with certain
judicial functions in the regulation of
freights and fares. We argued that as j
such it should proceed as other judicial
bodies do, to take testimony, hear wit
nesses, examine books and secure suffi
cient accurate information upon the sub
ject to enable it to render a judgment
which would resist assault In case of an
appeal to the courts. â¢
We warned the Railroad Commission
that any other course would result in
nothing Dut delay and confusion and
would eventuate in the reversal of any
action which the commission might take
by the Federal courts.
In spite of this warning the Railroad
Commission proceeded to arbitrarily re
duce the grain rates of the Southern Pa
cific Company 8 per cent below the then
existing schedule, and to resolve upon a
general reduction of 25 per cent in all the
schedules of tnat company. It was this
arbitrary action which speedily brought
the Railroad Commission to the bar of the
Federal court, and which has led, as we
prophesied it would, to the present de
cision. ' â¢
The position which The Call took with
reference to this subject Judge McKenna
has fully sustained. He decides that the
Railroad Commission is a legal body pos
sessing certain jud.cial and legislative
powers; that its judicial power is to be
exercised upon the subject of railroad
schedule?, and that in the regulation
thereof the commission should hear and
should be governed by the same evidence
which has been submitted to the court;
that its judgment is the subject of review
by the Federal judiciary by reason of that
section of the constitution which declares
that no person shall be deprived of his
property without due process ot law.
The decision of Judga McKenna indi
cates clearly and conclusively to the llail
road Commission what ita duties are, and
points out the precise course to be fol
lowed by it in its future attempts at the
regulation of freights and fares. It also
Indicates with more or less conclusiveness
that the State Board of Railroad Commis
sioners is about as useless a body as the
makers of our constitution could well have
conceived.
ROAD IMPROVEMENT.
The approaching meeting of the Legis
latures of the various States has revived
public interest in all parts of the country
upon the subject of road improvement,
and in most of tne progressive States
earnest efforts will be made to procure the
enactment o* legislation favorabie to tnat
work. It will be well for members of the
California Legislature to pay considerable
attention to what is proposed in this direc
tion in other States, as it is more t;;an
likely that California may profit by what
l has been done elsewhere.
At the present time Massachusetts
seems to have s-st the example and pace
for the country. According to a recent
report of the Road Commission of that
commonwealth the total expenditure ot
the State on its road work this year has
been $600,000, and it is expected that the
Legislature will be asked for $800,dOO for
1897. The commission has been in exist
ence for only three years, and during that
time 130 m.lea of improved highways have
been constructed. The fact that a larger
sum of money is expected to be voted
during the coming year than in the pres
ent one is sufficient evidence that the
work done is satisfactory to the people
and is regarded as an economy in every
sense of the word.
It is computed that in some districts of
Massachusetts there has been an average
rise in the value of property along im
proved roads of over $6 an acre. It is
moreover estimated that the losses to
farmers in that State in hauling their
products over mud roads as compared
with the cost of hauling it over improved
roads amounts to more than enough to pay
for the improvements. It will be seen,
therefore, that as the prout in ihe hauling
of produce pays for the cost of the road
the advanced value in the land is a clear
gain to t!;e land-owners.
A further evidence of the advantage of
good roads is shown 'in a paper recently
Bead by the superintendent of the Cnicau.o
City Railway giving a statement of the
records made by the dynamometer car on
the track of that road. The register of
the instrument proved that the saving on
good track over poor ones on that line
amounted to over $133,000 a year. The ex
tra cost of making v good road instead of
a poor one was $61,670. The estimated life>
I of the track is twelve years and the c. Icu
| lation is that the company by laying good
I 1 rack saves in hauling i*or that time over
! $335,000. This calculation was limited to
I the cost of motive power alone, and ex
cluded all considerations of wear and tear
on rollinu stock.
Thus ample evidence is obtained from
every direction of the advantage of good
roads, audit is certainly high time that
California should enter upon this work as
actively as any State in the Union. It is
also desirable that ttie work should b â 
largely uuder State direction and by State
aid. Earnest consideration should be
i civen to the subject by the coming Legis
j lat ure and the work promoted as far as
j possible. ___________
REFORM IN THE SOUTH.
One of tht best results from the break
ing up of the Democratic party in the re
cent electit n by reason of the division
bctwfen the pokl and the silver wing has
be n the awakening of the Southern mind
to the evil of election frauds. Conserva
tive Democrats have found that the party
bo-ses who remained with the silver side
have not hesitated to count out the votes
of white men as well as of neeroe.Â«, ami
as a consequence they are now making h
strong movement in the direction of
breaking up these long-tolerated abuse."
of the right of suffrage.
The a itation against election fraud
began before the election took place. Tht
conservatives knew what to expect and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1896.
were prepared for it. Just before the
State election in Georgia Rev. Sam Jones
r-a.d: "I no more believe that there will
be an honest election in this State on the
7th day of October than I believe that
every bum and thug and pap-sucker in
Georgia is a gentleman, a scholar and a
Christian. If we can't stop ballot-stuffing
and false returns we can watch the scoun
drels thnt perpetrate them and arraign
them before the honest people of this
State at all coming elections. Sit up with
the dirty scoundiels. In this day of rings
and rascality in politics the time has
come when a free ballot and a fair count
are the only hope of this country and t"he
only bulwark that stands between us and
revolution."
Tbe warning and the advice of Sam
Jones seem to have been followed to a
considerable extent by the better element
of the people when the Presidential
election came on, and now that it
is over many of the leading papers in the
South are making an earnest demand for
a thorough investigation of the vote in
disputed districts and the rigid enforce
ment of the law against all who are found
to have been guilty of any form of fraud.
Not much may be done this year, but
the movement once started will not end
until a bette"r condition of affairs is
brought about. It is therefore reasonable
to expect that succeeding elections in the
South will be fairer than they have been
at any time since the close of the war. A
divided Democracy means for theÂ° South
more than it means for any other section
of the country, and for the people of those
States at any rate the ne*w era will be one
of moral and intellectual as well as of ma
terial advancement.
WORK FOR CONGRESS.
It is virtually conceded that no tariff
legislation of importance will be enacted
at the coming session of Congress, and
this would seem to imply tnat nothing
will be done in the settlement of the cur
rency question, since it is clear we must
provide a sufficient revenue for the needs
of the Government be ore entering upon
the more complex question of finance.
Congress at this session -will not, how
ever, lack for work to do. It is said that
on the several calendars of the House
alone there are 1465 bills reported from
various committees. Most of them of
course are private bills, but there are
among them 256 which affect the general
welfare of the Nation. Oi course, only a
small portion of these will ever come be
fore the House at all, but enough will
reach that body to occupy all the time it
has to give them.
Out of all these bills there are but four
or rive which will engage any large amount
of public attention. These are tbe Nic
aragua canal bill, tbe Paciiic railroad
funding bill, th* bill to amend the law re
lating to second class mail matter, a
bill for the creation of a bureau for the in
spection of meat and the regulation .of
the transportation of livestock, and an
immigration restriction bill.
Of these measures not one is of a parti
san character. All of them, therefore,
have a .fair chance of success in both
houses if they are well pushed forward.
It is full time that some action should be
taken in regard to them, and under
Speaker Reed's active direction there is
reason to hope that the House at any rate
will carry on its work with sufficient
speed to deal witii tLem all before ad
journment.
It is quite probable that a bill will also
be introduced at this session providing for
the appointment of a Secretary of Mines
and Mining. The movement to that end,
begun by the California Miners' Associa
tion at its recent convention in thin City,
has been cordially taken up throughout the
West, and a strong force will be in Con
gress to it as soon as it can be
brought before that body. It seems Califor
nia will be expected to take the lead in tbe
movement, and there is no reason why our
delegation should not act this winter, in
stead qf postponing the matter until toe
assembly of the next Congress.
The two bills that wiil occupy most at
tention will be that of the Nicaragua
canal and t.iat relating to the funding of
the Pacific roads debt. These bilh are of
particular importance to the people of
California, and every movement made in
regard to either oi them will be watched
here with no little interest. Fortunately
we have a delegation in Congress which,
as a whole, can be relied on to actively
guard the interests of our people in each
case. The vote of California will be for
the Nicaragua canal and against funding.
These are the tignts before us, and to these
issues let us direct all the energy of the
State. â¢

NEW JERSEY'S FIRST COIN.
In Trinity churchyard, New York City, the
other day a workmun dug up a good specimen
of Xew Jersey's first coin.
The first pieces coined on the mainland of
North America, says the New York Evening
Sun, were made in accordance with a law
passed in Massachusetts, May 27, 1652. This

provided for the establishment of "amint
howse in Boston" and the coinage of silver and
copper pieces.
It was uot until 1786, however, that the
New Jersey Assembly attempted to coin its
own money. In that year a lav, was passed
authorizing a copper coinage and providing
for the construction of two mintsâ one at a
place kri'-wn as Solitude, about two miles west
of Morristown, and the other at Elizabeth.
The coins are described as follows: "Obverse,
a horsVs head, with a plow beneath; legend,
'Nova C'aesarea Unum.'" The inscription,
"Nova Csesarea," was the Latin name given to
the colony by its founders, Csesarea being tne
name which was bestowed upon the island of
Jer;>ey by the Romans at the time of their
conquest of Britain.
THE GREATESI OF INAUGURATIONS
Fitting That McKinley Shot/ld Makk an
Epoch in Political Events.
Cleveland Leader.
Already there is no doubt that the inaugu
ration oi William McKinley will be the occa
sion of more magnificent and inspiring festiv
ities than have yet been witnessed in Wash
ington. The crowds will be the greatest ever
seen in the National capital, and tne proces
sion is certain to break all records. Jubilant
and triumphant Republicanism will fill the
beautiful city with that electric atmosphere
wiiicli is created by the assembling oi multi
tudes of proud ana happy ireemen gathered
to do honor to their chosen leader.
All this is us it ought to be. The President,
whose popu.ar vote and popular j_lurality are
alike tiit greatest ever known, should see the
biggest and proudest crowd of admirers that
ever assembled in Washington. The victor in
the most sensational and important political
contest waged within the past thirty years
sureiy deserveÃ no ordinary "send-off" when
â he takes bis great and splendid office. When
the iiiieillgeni and conservative men of Amer
ica reflect upon the dangers escaped and the
blessings won under and largely through the
leadership oi William McKiulcy they must
feel that it would be impossible to exaggerate
the outburst of popular enthusiasm wuich
will mark the beginning of his term in the
chair of Washington, Lincoln, and the long
line of statesmen who have worthily filled the
hignest place known to human HUthority.
The inauguration of Mr. McKinley will be
an epoch-making event. It can hardly be em
phasized too strongly.

It is really most distressing
That, al bough my need* are pressing,
I cannot make the money that inferior fellows
omi;
Nor find an occupation
In this i'liilis.inisli nation
Congenial to a college-bred and cultivated man.
My talentsâ tney are many-
Do not brlns me in a penny.
Though the unenlightened vulgar go heaping up
their kuids,
1 can do so much that they can't,
Bui all -'situations vacatu"
Are reserved, as 1 discover, for the men of vacant
brains.
I was noted when at college
For a v^ry special knowledge
Of liMory. ant quities and numismatic lore;
But in coinage early dated
My interest has aba ed,
Borne interest on modern coins would benefit me
more.
In the "ologles" aDd "isms"
In all tbeologic schisms,
In the speculative system of both old and modern

I am versed, I may say, deeply,
But my views I'd part with cheaply
Could I ascertain the market wuere such a thing

J am trying legal practice,
But the melancuoly fact is
That although 1 passed with honors I took my law
degree,
And did credit to my tutors.
Yet I did not suit the suitors,
And my knowledge of fee-simple does not bring a
simple fee.
The thought I sometimes harbor,
That to be a chatty barber,
The conductor of a tramcar, or the driver ot a van,
Or to Â«et a place a waiter.
For the vulgar rich to cater,
Are about the only chance* for a cultivated man !

BOY'S KILT SUIT,
This model is suitable for boys of 3 to 6
years. The skirt may be of any heavy cotton
fabric or of wool.
For a dressy suit white piquet for the skirt,
with waist of white cotton or linen trimmed
with ruffles of embroidery, is charming.
An entire suit of brown hollands, with ruffles

WHY NAT GOODWIN
IS HOT IN JAIL
His Sudden Departure From
the State Is Ex
plained.
Disregards Judge Murphy's Order
to Appear and Ex
plain.
Contempt Proceedings Instituted in a
Divorce Case Tnat the Actor
Tried to Dismiss.
Nathaniel Carl Goodwin, comedian,
came within a few hundred miles of play
ing an engagement with Sheriff Whelan
yesterday, for Judge Murphy went so far
as to declare him guilty of contempt of
court, which heinous crime carries with
it a possible sentence of five days in the
County Jail and a fine not to exceed $500.
Judge Murphy even went further than
merely adjudging Mr. Goodwin in con
tempt, but actually ordered an attach-,
ruent for his arrest to issue forthwith.
If the matter had- been permitted to
rest there and if Mr. Uoodwin had not left
the State the night before he would be
now playing checkers with his nose be
hind prison bars.
District Attorney W. 8. Barnes, appear
ing for the nonce as a practitioner in a
civil suit, asked permission to explain
why bis client, Mr. Goodwin, had not
obeyed the summons of the court to give
an account of his worldly possessions
pending the hearing of the divorce suit of
Nathaniel Carl Goodwin versus Nelia R.
Goodwin. It was admitted that the cita
tion to appear had been personally served
on Mr. Goodwin, but that he intended no
contempt by his absence, because he had
been advised that the suit of Goodwin vs.
Goodwin having been dismis-ed there was
no cause pending, and that the court had
no jurisdiction in the matter.
'â¢Let us see about that," said Judge
Murphy, his manner taking on a more
complacent phase, for he seemed glad to
be assured that no contempt of court was
intended.
George B. Keane, a very young man
with a very red face, was sworn as a wit
ness and blushed violently as he confessed
that he was in some degree mixed up in
the discussion before the court. He said
he had been engage! to act as attorney for
Mr. Goodwin and that he had entered in
the office of the County Clerk an order of
dismissal at the request of Mr. Goodwin.
Being questioned as to his acts in that
regard Mr. Keane said that on the 19th of
November he went to the office of the
County Clerk and gave a written notice
that the suit should be dismissed, at the
same time depositing $2 to pay the ex
penses of the defendant as required by law.
On this showing Judge Murphy said
that he would recall the citation to Mr.
Goodwin and vacate the order of commit
ment for contempt of court until the court
could determine whether the case of
Goodwin vs. Goodwin were in fact still
pending, or whether it had been actually
dismis-ed. as contended by Mr. Barnes on
behalf of Mr. Goodwin.
Mr. McPike tried to read some articles
from the Chronicle an<l Examiner, in
which it appeared that Attorney R. Porter
Asbe had cast aspersions on the County
Clerk's office, but Judge Murphy refused
to hear me matter, saying thai if the
County Clerk had been libeled he had his
remedy a3 against the lawyer and the
newspapers.
It appeared that the point at issue was
whether the suit of Goodwin 'against
Goodwin was legally dismissed. Mr.
Barnes argued that this was so, since the
plaintiff hada,risÂ»nt to dismiss his suit
under the provision of the statute, no
cross complaint asking affirmative relief
having been tiled at the time the notice of
dismissal was given.
George W. Lee, E. J. Taylor. George T.
Covey and N. T. Maison testified that the
notice of dismissal was filed on the 19th
inst and was entered on the register, but
that the judgment was not fully recorded
until the 23d.
Attorney H. L. McPike, representing
Mrs. Goodwin, said that on the afternoon
of November 23, between 3 and 4 o'clock,
he called at the County CierK's office
with the answer and cross complaint anl
offered it for filing. He examined the
record and found a dismissal had been
tiled. He asked for the papers in the case
and after a while they were found. He
examined the papers and found that the
judgment roll had not been completed;
that the blanks of the date and the page
of the judgment had not been tilled in.
He therefore went before a Deputy County
Clerk and swore to tlie answer and had it
hied. On that showing he declared the
case was still in court, that the court ha 1
jurisdiction and that Mr. Goodwin could
De punished lor contempt.
Incidentally it was inferred that the
court would have authority to allow a fee
of $1000 for Mrs. Goodwin's attorneys and
to "rant her alimony pending the trial of
the case.
Attorney Barnes read an affidavit by
Mr Goodwin in which it was stated that
lie effected a settlement with her a year
ai?o by paying her $15,000 ami compensat
ing her for her interest in their household
furniture.
This paper was not mentioned in the
formal application of Mr. Barnes for the
dismissal of Mrs. Goodwin's cross-com
plaiiu, and the court decided that it
cou d not be considered at this time.
Mr. Ashe testified that he had advised
Mr. G>odwi . that the case against his
wife bad been legally dismissed. He
thought he was right in tliat advice. The
talk occurred Sunday afternoon at the
Palace Hot-'l.
"DM you advise Mr. Goo J win not to
obey the order of this court at tuis time?"
asked Mr. McPike.
"Certainly not," said Mr. Asha with a
cour'eous nod toward the bi-ncii.
"D d you say cood-by to him when you
parted?"
"Weli, yes; I guess so.
"And you didn't expect to see him
again soon?"
"I didn't say so."
"What did you say?"
"Tiiese were mv exact words. I said:
'Well, I suppose I'll see you in the morn
ing.' "
"Did you wink when you said that?"
"No."
"Did he wink?"
"Well, he looked very droll."
Mr. Barnesâ Did you smile?
The Courtâ What kind of â  smile?
Mr. McPikeâ Not that kind of a smile,
your Honor.
Mr. Barnesâ lt would cost two bits at
the Palace.
Mr. Asneâ l plead not guilty of that
Kind of a 3mile, at any rate.
So the attorneys and t c court bavin*
esiab ished the entente cordiale to their en
tire sat.siaction, there was siignt delay
until the lawbooks to the number of
nearly 200 couid be brought from the law
library. For ihree mortal hours the law
yers read decisions and argued points,
af er which Jud c Murp y promised to
decide the question at 10 o'c.ock this
morning.

INSANITY AS A PLEA.
Justice Henshaw in the Supreme Court
Gives a Vigorous Opinion.
The Supreme Court, in an opinion ren
dered by Justice Henshaw yesterday,
Justices McFarland, Temple, Harrison
and Van Fleet concurring, uttered some
vigorous words on the subject of the plea,
of insanity as extenuation in a murder
case.
Frank H. Larrabee was convicted of
murder and was sentenced for life. The
killing was admitted, the defense being
insanity. LarraDee killed his mistress,
cutting her throat after she had decamped
wit 1 his money and had deserted him for
another.
"The appellant claims," said Jnstice
Henshaw, "that the atrocity of the mur
der and tne lack of motive lor the crime,
together wit 1 the other evidence in the
case, established insanity for a clear pre
ponderance. But if circumstances of in
humanity and barbarity.were to be held
sufficient to prove the irresponsihilitv of
the perpetrator of a homicide, it would be _.
an invitation to the evil-minded to JJKM
crease the number of their victims aneflfl
make tbÂ«eir crimes blacker and more 11 5^^
famous.
'â¢Such circumstances may be evidence
of insanity, but they may equally owe
their existence to the promptine of a
brutal and malignant spirit." The" judg
ment of the lower court was affirmed.

Three Strange Lights Seen

BACK ON THEIR COURSE
Hart Tells Why His Client's
Airship Takes to Great
Altitudes.
S MUCH EASIER TO OfEKATE
The Attorney G yes an Account of a
Wosderful El.ctric Storage
Battery.
Every day and every night add more
testimony from those who have seen or
claim to know something about fcbo
mysterious lights that for the past two
weeks have appeared in the sky Irom
Central to Southern California. Every
day and eyery night add to the number
of those who are converted from skep
ticism to a. belief that these lights are
attached to an airship or aerial craft such
as the world has never seen before.
Whatever all these mysterious things
may be it stands to reason, that the
mystery cannot exist for ever, and in all
probability the truth will be known ere
many days or weeks pass. It is the pur
pose of The Call to secure this knowl
edge and present it to the public, be it air
ship or hoax.
The telegraphic- dispatches published in
yesterday's Call gave accounts of the ap
pearance of strange lights making rapid
Hights over the San Fernando Valley, in
Los Aneeles County. Last night the peo
ple of Los Angeles City were treated to
the strange sisht, Two fixed lights passed
over the city at a high rate of speed and at
a very great distance from the earth. A
third light that appeared to have all the
characteristics of a searchlight in the
handg of a skillful manipulator was
also Been ia conjunction with
tue two fixed lights. These passed
according to reports from the northwest
to the southeast, and two hours later they
reappeared, passing from the southeast to
the northwest. A number who witnessed
the phenomenon were inclined Ick Delieve
that some practical jofcer was sending up
toy balloons from the hills, but those who
believed in the airship theory were unable
to understand how toy balloons could
pass in opposite directions over the same
course, or what kind of toy balloon was
used that could stay up at a high altitude
with lights abiaze for over two hours.
Ex-Attorney-General W. H. H. Hart,
the attorney for the inventor, while dis
cussing the power that could be or is used

teresting information regarding the new

terested. He stated that the whole ap
paratus of a twenty-horsepower storage
battery weighs only about 125 or' 130
pounds. The receiving jars proper have
been reduced to such a small compass that
they weigh less than three pounds, and
that a jar of this size can be charged from
ap ordinary incandescent li.ht wire.
Under such circumstances the master
of an airship would have but
little trouble in taking in "fuel" that
would enable him to travel a great mapy
miles. He could have his ship secretedin
the hills, walk into any town along the
route on which he might chose to travel,
hire, a room in a hotel, tap a wire, rill his
soda bottles with chain lightning and
resume his voyage through the upper air
for another nundred miles or more.
The proposition seems almost too gigan
tic to be true, but stranger things Lave
uappened in the realm of science within
the last few years.
A late dispatch received last night from
Los Angeles reads as follows: â 
"The mysterious air3hip was seen again
here to-nieht. The thing moved about
over the city for an hour. There is no
doubt as to the genuineness of the phe
nomenon, whatever it- might be. Jack
Faulkner, Ricnard Sweet and other repu
table citizens, who were directly under
the strange visitor, state that they 3aw
its wihgs. It created great excitement on
the streets to-night."
WHY HE SAILS HIGH.
Attorney Hart Tells Why the Air
ship Is Taken Far From
the Earth.
General W. H. H. Hart still insists that
the much-talked-of airship is "a reality and
that the thousand or more people who
have seen lights moving in the sky and
were able to discern the outlines of an
object above were not the victims of high
pressure imaginations. He goes still
further and asserts that there are two air
ships now moving about in the heavens
over the Golden State, a large one and a
smaller one. He believes that one is now
in the southern part of the State and the
other is prowling around through hereto
fore unexplored space in the more north
ern latitude".
"Then your inventor must have an as
sistant who understands aerial navigation
as well as himself,'* was suggested to Gen
eral Hart.
"Yes, he has," was the response. "He
told me that there is very little trouble in
handl ng the machine. All ttiat is re
quired is a eood cool-headed man with a
fair amount of common-sense and one
who is not likely to become excited or
lose his presence of mind at high alti
tudes.
"I have no doubt that he has such men
with him. At least he told me that he
had. You must remember that an airship
is very easy to handle at extremely high
altitudes â much easier than near the sur
face of the earth."
In explaining what he meant by this as
sertion General Hart gave some interest
ing information as to why the lights are
always.feeen at siren great distances from
the earth. He illustrated his point by
calling attention to the fact that an ordi
nary gas or hot-air balloon, on being re
leased from the ground, darts like an ar
row from a bow iitto the air and that the
farther away from the earth it gets the
slower its upward fli ht.
"The reason for this," he explained, "is
tnat after the balloon has reached a certain
altitude the gas that carried it to that
point is not so much lighter than the sur
rounding atmosphere and its buoyancy
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1896.
is thereby decreased. Then aerial navi
gation becomes practically easy, for the
operator does not have to expend power
in forcing the balloon filled with sas and
the airship attachment against the wind.
This is the reason that tt;e inventor has
gone so high when experimenting with
bis ship. He tells me that at a great
height he can go against the wind with
comparative ease, but that at 300 or 400.
feet from the ground he is compelled to
use up a great deal of power."
The subject uppermost in the ceneral'6
mind, the freeing of Cuba from Spain,
came to the surface in the conversation,
and the attorney said that "the inventor
ia likely at any time to pack up his smaller
airship and start for the scene of blood
shed and trouble."
"It can be easily done," he said. "In
the first place the material of the outfit is
light, and the ship can readily be packed
in cases and shipped away by rail without
attracting the least attention, and it would
take but a short time to put it together
again."
"How could this be done when your
power.is a storage battery that will only
last six hours?" was asked.
"There would be no difficulty about
thai," was the response. "The. Fargo
storage battery can be recharged any
where where there is an electric-light wire,
and there are electric power and lighting
plants in all of the towns from here to
Arizona, and from Arizona to the South
ern States.
"The whole apparatus of the twenty
horsepower Fargo battery does not weigh
over 125 pounds, and the storage battery
proper can be carried in your overcoat
pocket, it not weighing over three pounds.
Each section weighs but a little more than
a sodawater bottle filled with water. He
could come into this office and charge his
entire battery by tapping one of those in
candescent-light wires. So, you see that
he could take his ship across the continent
without any trouble at all. Speaking of
the expedition to Cuba reminds me that
already I am beginning to receive letters
from people who desire to go as volunteers
in the new aerial navy. Here is one. I
will read it to you, but not give the writ
er's name:
Madera, 11â 29â '96.
W. H. H. HartâDiikK Sir: If it is possible
please consider me as a volunteer for the
party in the airship to go to Cuba. I am 40
years of age and in perfect health and
strength. Am a fairly educated man, a good
telegraph operator, stenographer and type
writer oper". tor. I understand that it will be
a very hazardous enterprise, but believe me,
there is no danger that 1 am not perfectly
willing and clad to face.
1 shall fear no hing and will go anywhere
and do anything my superiors may command
or desire. It does not matter to any one if I
am Killed, as I have no ties. I have no fam
ily, relatives or persons relying upon me, and
for that reason alone I should be sent. I
will take any obligation as to secrecy, faith
fulness, etc., and willingly answer with my
lifeforit. High altitudes do not affect me.
Please let me hear from you at y.our earliest
convenience. Afost respectfully , ' .
'â¢'Will you engage him?"
"I will not. I will hand his Letter over
to the inventor, and he will do with the
proposition as he sees fit. I have no
doubt but what, as he is related to die
electrician of Maceo's army, all the ar
rangements were made as to the crew and
other details before he came to this part
of the continent. As I have said before,
he came here to test his airship in the
high altitudes; the lower heavier strata of
air and the fogs from the ocean. He
wanted to test it under ocean conditions.
"In the East the wind blows from the land
to the sea, but here it blows in from the
sea, and ii? an expedition over Cirba he
wants to be thoroughly familiar with
ocean atmosphere. The last time 1 Raw
the inventor his purpose was to operate
his ship in the high, dry atmosphere over
the southern part of the State, and from
the telegraphic accounts in The Call he
must be there now with one of his air
ships. We are told that his lights have
been seen by hundreds in Los Angeles
County, and I have no idea that they were
jack-o'-lanterns or fakes."
SEEN OVER LOS ANGELES.
The City Excited Over Bright
Lights Apparently Under
Some One's Control.
LOS ANGELKS, Cal., Nov. 30.â Los Angeles
is excited and people are gazing up.ward from
every corner at what all who have seen them
declare are the lights of an airship. The
altitude of these strange lights was very great
and the movement was from northwest to
southeast. Passengers on board many of the
streetcar lines witnessed the zigzag glimmer
as it floated slowly and placidly through the
upper air.
Most of the force of the two'mornirig dailies
saw the lights, which reappeared after two
hours' time, going in the opposite direction.
Some of the witnesses describe the appearance
of these lights, two-of which were fixed, while
a third light had the characteristics of a
searchlight and was apparently under the
operation of a skilled manipulator.
These litchts were seen by so many reputable
citizens that the town is talking nothing else
to-night except the strange lights and the
probable influence of the invention, if it
proves such, upon methods of warfare and the
transmission cf intelligence from one part of
the world to another. The probability of the
ship is conceded on all hands, and much
speculation is rife as to its most' important
uses in peace and war.
The latest and most conclusive evidence
extant reached this city to the effect that
Foreman Woods, on Lucky Baldwin's
ranch at Santa Anita, bad seen the vis
itor this afternoon by the fall light
of day. H. A. Unruh, manager of
the ranch, places the utmost reli
ance in the word of his foreman
and in consequence said to a Call corre
spondent that this statement satisfied
him. There is some ground for the re
port that a genuine airship was being
operated among the foothills, not only in
the night but in the daytime.
This information was telephoned to the
Chamber of Commerce in this city to-day.
This information staggers the most credu
lous. Serious people, judges and promi
nent business men have now been led to
conclude that t ere is more in aerial
philosophy than they had ever dreamed of.
Foreman Woods' description tallies with
the published accounts and pictures in
The Call during the past week, namely:
as to its birdlike wings and other charac
teristics. Mr. Woods claims to have had a
good, plain view of the winged visitor,
and describes in detail its every part.
The hull or body, he says, is of oval
shape, while the wings are long and fash
ioned remarkably like those of an Ameri
can eagle. Its rapid movement through
the air is w.'i at impressed Mr. Woods the
most. The machine, he said, was travel
ing -against the wind, and at a rats of
speed equal to the lastest train.
The hills about the city are lined with
gazers watching for a late reappearance of
the ship. To this mass of evidence a
hackmau, whose*occupaiion keeps him up
all night, adds that he has seen the ship
as late as BA. K. This gentleman, whose
name is Carroll, describes the appearance
of searchlight feature with clearness.
Ue says that ho is absolutely certain
that what he saw was an aerial machine
under the guidance of an intelligent be
ing, and that the searchlight was capable
of revealing objects on the earth and the
general topography of the country to the
operators.
SAINT ANDREWS
BRETHREN MEET
Thirty- Fourth Celebration
Is Marked by a
Banquet.
Eloquent Speeches by Irving M.
Scott and Charles M.
Shortridge:
Officers E'ected and Installed, and
tne Festivities End With
a Dance.
The Brotherhood of St. Andrew, 200
strong including lady guests, celebrated
its thirty-fourth annual meeting and in
stallation of officers last night at the
Palace. The banquet-room was ex
quisitely decorated. At one end hung a
large American flag and at the other end
the flag of Scotland, over which were the
American colorj. The best known of the
Scottish people of the City were present,
and altogether it was a rare season of en
joyment. Many beautiful costumes were
displayed by the ladies.
The installing of the officers took place
in the maple room and was informal in
character, James S. Webstes being the in
stalling officer. The following were the
officers installed :
President, Andrew Wilkie; first vice-presi
dent, William Watson; second vice-president,
P. L. Dunn; treasurer, Y. C. La wson; record
ing secretary, W. C. Cook ; assistant recording
secretary, Alex Kannie; thtaLciul secretary, R.
D. Coiquhoun; assistant financial secretary,
J. D. Robertson; librarian. Joseph Gray; trus
teesâ Samuel Irving, John Reid, Kichard
Gratto, James Scobie, Andrew McNair; board
of reliefâ Joseph P. Cocnrane, John M. Dun
can, .Robert Sutherland; physician, Dr. W. F.
McNutt; chaplain, Rev. George D. B. Stewart.
Tile n*w president oi the Brotherhood,
Andrew Wnkie, presided at the elaborate
banquet tuat had been prepared. Imme
diately on his right sat Irving M.Scott,
C. M. Snortridge and Chaplain J. B. Stew
art and Mrs. Stewart. On his left were Y.
C. Lawsou, the Rev. H. C. Minton and
Miss Skirvln. It was a happy and en
thusiastic gathering. The band piayed
"In the Garb of O.d Gaul" when the re
past was liuished, and John D. McGiivray,
ex-Alderman of Denver and contractor
for the Parrott and Spreckels buildings,
arose and spoke to the toaat of "The Day
and a' Wha Honor It.""
"A Scotchman is always a good citizen,
wherever he is," said Mr. McGiivray, and
was greeted with cheers. He spoke of the
triumphs of McLaren, Barne, Crockett and
many other famous Scotchmen, and de
clared .that America offered a singularly
attractive field for the people of his native
land. He made an eloquent address and
was frequently applauded.
Everbody joined ia singing "God Save
the Queen." Then President Wilkie
asked for three cheers for the Queen.
They were given heartily, but -when he
asked for three cheer 3 ior the President of
the United States they were given even
more heartily.
The Rev. H. C. Minton, D.D., delivered
a humorous address to the toast, "The
Land o' Cakes." He said he had missed
being born in Scotland only by about 300
years of ancestry in the United States.
But these early ancestors hud originally
come from Scotland, and when he visited
that beautiful country last summer he
felt almost like a native of Scotland. But
â¢the cakes reminded him more of frozen
sawdust than anything else. He said he
would give a fortune if he had the Scotch
accent.
Irving M. Scott spoke eloquently to the
toast, "The Land We Live in." He told
of the beauties and resources of Scotland
only to contrast them finally with those
of the United States. "This laud," he
said, "is our inheritance. In this iavored
land, where is sent forth a barrel of flour
for every man, woman and child, besides
what is eaten, there is opportunity for all.
"Heft in California, more than any
other State, there is no want, while
in the old countries of the globe it is met
with on every hand." And though
building warships he spoke for peace and
was warmly applauded. "Peace, not
war," he said, "settled the Venezuelan
contest.
After the music, "And Are Ye Sure the
News Is True," Charles M. Shortridge
was called on to speak to the toast of
"The Press." He humorously said he
presumed the words "and are ye sure the
news is true" referred to the airship. For
answer he said he would refer to the ex-
Attorney-General of the State.
He complimented his old friend Dr.
Minton for his eloquent words and Mr.
Scott for his exhortation for peace, and
then touched directly the subject of the
press, advocating unity of action for the
good of man. "The press should be
united," he said. "By unity it could
muve mountains. It could make war im
possible. It should win the love and
not gain the fear of mankind.
If it would work in harmony
it would command the respectofall. it
should be united for law andorder, fo r
honest .men, in opposition to wrong. It
should be for decency and against every
thing that destroys the home. But Ido
not atppear as the critic of the piess, but
rather as its champion. Generally speak
ing, in its work of advancement the press
has done a brave part. It is not perfect,
It is a great instrument for trood."
"The Lassies." was responded to by An
drew McNair, and ' Our Sister Societies,"
by D. Edward Collins. R. Park sang "D'ye
Mind Lanp Syne"; J. Niven, "The Scot
tish Kail Brose"; W. C. Cook, "The Red,

eebates'tied up.
Supervisors Extend the Time for Their
Payment- Delinquents Must
Pay Up.
It will be the lGth inst. at least before
those who are entitled to a rebate en the
taxes paid during, the early part of this
year receive their money. The Board of
Supervisors passed a resolution to that ef
fect yesterday and rescinded the measure
ordering the payment to begin to-morrow.
This will be a disappointment to a great
many taxpayers who have money tied up
in the City treasury, and will cause sev
eral City officials much trouble and an
noyance. Supervisor Dimond, who signed
the resolution, gave as a reason lor intro
ducing the measure that it was desired by
Attorney Wnlett^who is employed by the
board to collect delinquent taxes.
"Mr. Willett," said Mr. Dimond, after
the meeting of the board, "has advised us
that we have the right to hold back the
rebates of those who owe the City for de
linquent taxes and force collections in that
way.
"We have not consulted the City and
County Attorney in regard to the matter,
but have no doubt that tne delinquent tax
collector is correct. We shall try it any
way.
"Tiiose who do not owe delinquent taxes
will receive their money as soon as the
lists made up by the Auditor can cc com
pared with those in the possession of the
collector. The delinquents will have to
pay."
AU'iitor Broderick is of the opinion that
the board has no right to hold the rebates
to pay the delinquencies, and that if a
combination of those who are being kept
out of their money test the matter in a
legal manner and with the aid of a com
petent attorney, they will be sustained by
the courts.
He is also curious to know why the lists
oi those who are entitled to rebates have
not been called for before, as they have
been finished and in his office, bound and
ready for use for weeks. In the mean
time the brokers are eagerly gathering
assignments from among ihe 29,000 proo
erty-owners who have rebates coming,
and the chances are that they will collect
most of the $175,000 now lying idle in the
treasury.
This money, is a white elephant on the
hands of Treasurer Widber, and he has
already made complaints regarding tne
trouble it has given him. Deputy Treas
urer Louis Jacobs said yesterday that
from 100 to 300 people call a* the treasury
each day to get their money ami to eacn
one an explanation must be made why the
money isnot ready ior distribution.
"I spend hours repeating the story over
and over," he said, "ana it is getting
rather wearisome. I wish the board
would hurry up and let the money be dis
tributed."
HER PECULIAR MALADY,
Sarah Luntz, a Young Woman
Whose Actions Resemble
Those of a Horse.
She Was Taken From the Almshouse
Yesterday to Be Sent to the
Ukiah Asylum
Sarah Luntz, an inmate of the Alms
house, whose peculiar malady has been
referred to on more than one occasion
in The Call, is now in the Receiving
Hospital, having yesterday been com
mitted to the Ukiah Asylum by the In
sanity Commissioners.
She has been an inmate of the Alms
house for the past sixteen years, having
been taken there when she was a child
about 5 years of age.
Her fattier was a sailor and her mother
a circus rider. Ail her actions resemble
those of a horse. Her teeth are shaped
like a horse's teeth, and she bites like that
animal.
She cannot speak, and the only sound
she utters is something closely resembling
the neighing of a norse. If a fly touches
her the whole of her body shivers the
same as that of a horse in the same pre
dicament.
She has other characteristics resembling
the horse. In drinking she sucks up the
water; before uttering the neighing sound
she lifts up her head; she kicks like a
horse, and holds her head to oue side
wnen making a bite.
Sue is blind, but has a fine sense of
touch with her hands, which are beauti
fully formed, and her fingers are long and
tapering. She can hear, but has no real
ization of what is said to her. When
spoken to she holds out her hand to be
taken hold of and utters a soft whinney
ing sound. She has beautiful blonde hair
and her features are not displeasing.
It was the intention to send her to the
Home for the Feeble-minded, but there
was no room for her, and it was accord
ingly decided to send her to the Ukiah
Asylum.

to Escape an Appren

Honorable Career in California
as Lumber Merchant and
Builder.
His Will Is Now Contested by a
Nephew and a Niece Who AU
lege Undue Influence.
Rev. Joseph P. "Wilson and Mrs. Cather
ine Strad, by their attorneys. Knight &
Heegerty, have filed a protest to the ad
mission to probate of the will of the late
Jacob Z. Davis, alias Jacob Z. Dediker,
who was for many years known in this
City and Sacramento asa leading business
man, lumber merchant and builder, and
who died in Philadelphia on the 28th of
last month, leaving an estate valued at
more than $2,000,000.
The document tiled by Mr. Wilson and
Mrs. Strad makes the assertion that John
Dediker and Catherine Ziegler were mar
ried previous to 1829 and that they were
the parents of Henrietta Dediker, George
Dediker and Jacob Z. Dediker, the latter
being the same person afterÂ«vard!known
as Jacob Z. Davis: tnat Henrietta Dediker
and Clayton P. Wilson were married July
5. 1829, and died leaving issue surviving
them these petitioners, Josey-h P. Wilson,
Catherine Strad and Jacob Wilson ; that
Jacob Wilson died November 20, 1896, and
that George Dediker died before Jacob Z.
Davis, alias Dediker; that Jacob Z. Davis
ieft him surviving neither wife, nor
mother, nor father, nor brother, nor sister,
and that these petitioners and the heirs of
Jacob Wilson are the only surviving next
of kin and heirs at law of Jacob Z. Davis,
alias Dediker,
On the 16th of November the will of
Davis waa filed, in which he bequeathed
his entire estate to Lizzie Muir and Belle
Curtis. To tniÂ« disposition of the prop
erty the contestants object, and for the
grounds of their protest allege that at the
time of the alleged execution of the will
said Davis was of unsound mind, that the
will was not written by him, and that ac
the time of the alleged execution he was
under the undue and improper influence
of persons at this time unknown, and
which persons poisoned the mind and
heart of the deceased against these peti
tioners and their brother by making false
statements to Davis and imposing on him
so that he believed that these petitioners^
were wanting in affection for him and
were eager for his death so that they
might thereby acquire his estate; which
unknown persons did solicit and procure,
by arts and wiles and by professions of
affection for him, the making of said
new to-dat:

alleged wilj, if the same ever was made by
him.
The petitioners^isk that the alleged will
be declared null and void and request a
jury trial of the issues thus raised.
The explanation of Mr. Davis' act in
changing his name is that he made tha
change in the year 1849 when he ran away
from Philaciephia, his native town, ana
started lor this State in search of fortune.
He did not change his name on account
of any disgraceful act, however, but only
to conceal his identity and thereby escape
from an apprenticeship. He nad been
bound to a tradesman under the appren
ticeship system of those days and when
the California gold excitement reached
the Quaker City young Dediker resolved
to join an expedition to tne Pacific Coast.
To prevent discovery he changed his name
to Davis and was known only as Jacob Z.
Davis throughout his subsequent career
which was honorable and commendatory
in every way.

The Fruit-Raisers' Convention Will
Be Asked to Indorse the
Movement.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 30.â The
annual convention of the State Fruit
prowers' Association will open in the
State Capitol at 9:30 o'clock to-morrow
morning. A number of fruit-growers
have already arrived and the attendance
promises to be very large by to-morrow
evening. There will be forenoon and
afternoon sessions, but no evening meet
ings. Or. "Wednesday evening a reception
will be given the fruit-growers in the
{Senate chamber by the State officers and
citizens of Sacramento. The convention
will continue through Friday. Tie pro
gramme is subject to revision. That for
to-morrow is as follows:
Morning sessionâ A report of the committee
from the last session on co-operative fruit
unions will be read. The committee consists
of K. I>. Stephens of Sacramento, B. F. Walton
of Yuba City, A. B. Sprague of Antelope, C. J.
Berry of Visalia and F. M. Righter of Camp
bell. Report by the secretary on memorials
and resolutions passed at the last session.
Afternoon sessionâ EssÂ«y, "Should Tree
PUnting Be Encouraged or Discouraged? If
Ko. What Kind, Varieties, etc.?" b,y General N.
P. Chipmnn of Red Uluff ; essay, "How- to Im

Â«"itv; essay, "Protecting Orchards from
Frost," by W. H. liammon, forecast official, of
tian Francisco ; addresses by Hon. B. F. Lang
ford and P. B. Armstrong, representing State
convention of almond-growers, respecting
Congressional legislation affecting the almond
industry.
Many of the leading aLmond-growers of
the State, who are here to attend the fruit
growers' convention also, met in the
Capitol to-night to prepare a memorial to
Congress showing the needs and require
ments of this industry, which is one of
the most important in California. Ther6
are over 500 almond-growers and 1,500,000
almond trees in the State. Over 800.000 of
these are full bearing trees, producing
from seven to eight pounds to a tree.
The total annual product of almonda in
this State is about 5,500.000 pounds, which
is about half the quantity that is annually
consumed in this country. Ten thousand,
people are employed in the almond indus
try, at $1 a uay average wages, from six
weeks 10 three montns in the year. They
are mostly women and children. Sixteen
cents a day is the average paid in Europe
for the same labcr.
P. B. Armstrong of Acampo, San Joa
quin County, was elected chairman of the
meeting, and W. C. Green secretary. The
following memorial was prepared:
To the Honorable, the Senate and the House
of Representatives of the United Stales of
America, in Congress assembled: Your me
morialists, the fr u it-c rowers of the State of
Caliiornia, in convention assembled at Sacra
mento, this 30 ill day of November, 189tt, most
respectfully represent:
Tliat the climate and soil of this State and
ntlier States on the Pacific Coast are adapted
to the grow Ui oi the almond, which tree is
jirown extensively and produces nuts of good
quality, and in quantities nearly sufficient to
pupply the demand for such product in the
Tinted States; and the success of this enter
prise is of the greatest importance to the
Tactile Coast states, California in particular,
find to the Nation.
Your memorialists further represent that,
owing to great competition of foreign-grown
almonds sold in our i.ome markets aud the
low tariff on imported almonds, this home
product cannot be sold at a profit; that there is
scarcely an almond-grower who has made the
slightest percentage of profit from trees planted
within the past ten years. On the contrary,
the business has been conducted at a loss, and
this loss will continue until the tariff on im
ported almonds be revised to meet the exi
gencies of the case. That there is no other
American industry so justly entitled to a
higher protective tariff tuan the almond in
dustry.
In support of the memorial the growers
claim tnat the selling prices is from 10 to
12 cents a pound, and they want the tariff
on foreign almonds increased 5 or 6 cents
a pound. They will ask for a higher tariff
than that fixed for almonds in the Mc-
X;nley bill. Chairman Armstrong at
tended the last session of Congress, and
he said that if he had had the backing of
the almond-growers and fruit-growers he
could have had the tariff retained at 5
,cents at least. It was stated that owing
to the heavy freight rates it was impossi
ble for California almond-grower-< to com
pete with foreigner in the New York and
Atlantic seaboard markets.
The walnnt-growcs have been invited
to join the almond peopie in tire memo
rial, as their interests are identical. It ij
proposed to assess each almond-grower
from 5 to 10 cents an acre to support the
expense of presenting the memorial to
Congress in a proper and effective way.
The memorial will be presented to the
fruit-growers' convention to-morrow, with
the request that it indorse it.
CRUELTY AT WHITTIER.
Trustee Mitchell "in Her Report to Coy-
Budd Suggests Radical Re
forms.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 30.âTrns
tea Mitchell of the Whittier Reform
School filed with Governor Budd to-day a
special report on that institution, offering
a number of important suggestions touch
ing the reform of juvenile offenders.
Compulsory education throughout the
(State, compelling all children between the
ages of 7 and 14 to attend school and mak
ing their parents and guardians respon
sible for their appearance at school, under
the penalty of the law, is strongly advo
cated.
The trustee contends that no boy under
14 or girl under 12 years of age should be
admitted to the reform institutions,
claiming that it is only in abnormal cases
that children under theÂ«e ages commit
crime, while at the present time Whittier
is crowded with little children whose
parents had connived to get rid of them.
To provide for this class it is recom
mended that the Board of Supervisors of
each county be empowered to appoint a
board of charities, which shall act in con
junction with the educational authorities
in providing for their maintenance at
home. Truant schools are also advo
cated, where children may be corrected,
restrained and disciplined.
Many of the methods in vogue at Whit
tier are cbsolete, the dovs being all housed
in the main building, whereas the cottage
system for smaller beys aivd dormitory
barracks for tLÂ«j larger ones is preferable.
The erection ot a new trades ouilding is
said to be absolutely necessary for success
fully carrying out tne aims and purposes
ot tiie school, and in it should be tautrhc
the fundamental principles of trade and
trades rather than their branches. In the
eiioe department, as an instance, the boy
should be taught everything connected
with the craft, instead of one particular
thing.
The following reforms are recommended
in the girls' department:
Looms for enrpet-weaving should be set up.
Knuiiug machines should be introduced and
pupils taught how to operate them. Expert
dressmaking and tailoring should be taught.
l'lain cooking is already taught, but as an
absolute science it Is not treated. Clay model
ing aud wood-carving should be taugnt.
Dairy work in all its branches and floral cul
ture and gardening should be introduced.
1 want to say right here that the girls at
Whittier have heretofore been outrageously
ana brutally punisned and neglected, for
which I hold the management respansible.
Solitary confinement in a cell and corporal
punishment with the strap have been wrong
fully resorted to. The dark cell and the con
trivances of brute lorce are not so
much terrors to them, but are natural ene
mies thai cause them to fight and resist. Such
may do In some cases for adult and matured
depravity, but as a system of discipline ior
wayward children it is barbarism and a relic
of the dark ages, which is a disgrace to mod
ern civilization. The remedy for all this, 1
repeat, is firm kindness and deprivation of
privileges. The heart of a child is a strange
kingdom, but love will find its way and win.
Furthermore, these eiris have been abso
lutely neglected in respect to their personal
needs. Recently, in supervising an Inventorj
of this department, I found that many of the
girls were in rags and tatters aud in absolute
neod of sufficient clothiug, and they have no
proper change of either outer or under wear.
New outfits should be Immediately provided,
and there should be a change in the character
of the uniform dresses. For these reasons I
must earnestly urge more liberai expenditure
for the needs of these girls.
Mrs. Mitchell recommends the estab
lishment of an independent establishment
for girls at lone, which would be better
for the girls and more economical for the
State. She also recommends that the
Preston and Wnittier schools be con
solidated and established at Eldridge,
where plenty of rich land, well watered,
can be procured.
FRUIT PESTS AND REMEDIES.
Practical Papers Collected by the Hoard
â  of Horticulture.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 30.â The
State Board of Horticulture met this after
noon and listened to the reading of various
reports from its representatives through
out the State. " ' '
The reports are lengthy and interesting,
dealing with the various pests and scales
which menace the fruit industries of the
State, and the remedies which have
been discovered and applied in infected
orchards. . â¢ - . : 'â â ".
Instances are given in which new varie
ties of cutworms, hitherto unknown in
the United States, were discovered in the
earth surrounding the roots of imp orted
palms and ornamental shrubs. A new
species of scale was discovered on the
limbs of trees forwarded from the
isthmus, necessitating the destruction of
the entire import.
Another paper tells of the cultivation of
the enemies of the scale and the beneficial
effects which followed their release in the
infected orchards. An insect enemy of
the pine scale, which during : the' past
year has threatened the pine and fir
growth of Golden Gate Par*, has been dis
covered, and this insect, planted in the
park, has almost eradicated the threat
ened evil.
VETOES A 1 YRANCHISE.
Sacramento's Mayor >nijt a Valuable
Privilege Should yot Be Given Away.
SACRAMENTO, Cal., Nov. 30.â Some
weeks ago the San Francisco Gaslight and
Fuel Company applied for a franchise to
lay pipes in the streets of this city, and
subsequently the Trustees granted it.
To-night Mayor Hubbard vetoed the
ordinance. The company agreed to sup
ply gas for five years after obtaining the
franchise for $1 50 per 1000 feet. The
Mayor says such franchises are worth
money, and he is opposed to granting any
more of them for nothing. â¢ .
Besides it might be two or three years
before the company would be able to lay
its pipes and mains, and by the time it
was prepared to famish gas the live years
would have almost passed, and it would
then be at liberty to charge any price
which it Or its assigns might see tit.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1896.
STANFORD MAY
HONOR COTTON
The University Fullback
Slated for Football
Captain.
Fickert Declines N to Accept the
Position for Another
Season.
I
For the First Tims in Years the
Student Eody Is Believed to
B; Oat cf Dabt.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Cat,., Nov.
30.â Now that the football season is over
speculation 1 is rile as to next year's cap
tain. The election is left to those football
players who have taken part in a regular
scheduled game as Varsity men. and any
player is eligible for the position. This
year there will be eighteen or twenty men
entitled to vote for the captain. The
election will be held in about teu days.
Inasmuch as the captaincy of the football
eleven is the highest athletic honor among
all the branches of sport at a college, and
withal one of the highest honors a man
can receive in college, there are generalfy
a number of aspirants for the position.
This year Stewart Cotton seems to be the
only man in the race, and his generally
recognized ability, so clearly proven in
the game Thanksgiving day, will doubt
lest make him the next captain of the
Stanford team.
Many of the player 3 and hosts of Cap
tain Fickeri's friends urged him \ L o captain
the team once more. Cotton, with his
customary generosity, volunteered to
withdraw in Fickeri's favor, but vhe big
captain was not to be outdone in v/hole
heartedness and firmly refused to run
again. He declared that he could not af
ford to devote so much time another sea
son to the game, and that it seemed to
him a bad thing to start* such a precedent.
Cotton, be declared, was capable of get
ting out a good team, and if he should be
elected captain would get the reward of
conscientious playing and bard work.
Stewart Cotton is 19 ytars old, an excel
lent stuue'nt, now in his third year. His
wonderful aptitude for the game was dis
played in the Stanford-Berkeley tame,
and his experience ot three years at Stan
ford and two years at Belmont has given
him a mastery of the principles of the
game. He was elected captain of the 'us
team a "ear ego and managed his class
eleven with much skill.
The students, now that the lull has come
aiter tne rejoicing over the football vic
tory, are speculating on the financial re
turns and whether the student body will
be able to get rid of its old debts at last.
Each year ior two years past there has
been an attempt made to wipe out ex
penses incurred during that season and
preceding years; but the indebtedness
*ept gradually increasing. La*t year it
looked as though the returns would be
sufficient to ck-ar away all outstanding
accounts, and this was done with tb,e ex
ception of about $BUO. Then a theatrical
venture, together with loss on a southern
trip by the musical club, again raised the
debt tbsH;ooor-SI7OO.
Expenses of a roach amounted to about
$1400. The training-table, kept running
for six weeks, was another big expense.
Ttien there were the week at Congress |
Springs for the football players, the "rub- j
bers," care of tield, doctors' bills, outfit
ting of the men and all, which make the
expenses oi the season quite heavy. The
cost of the grounds was s shared equally by
the teams.
About $12,000 was taken in at the game
and this is divided equally between the
two colleges after deducting common ex
pense?. Last year football by itself turned
in a profit to the student tody of about
$1400. This year it should turn in at
least $GOO more. The Stanford entertain
ment at the California Theater in the
evening netted at least $350 and the
lootball souvenirs $300, so altogether
it now looks' as though Treasurer P. W.
Morrison will be able to have a little sur
plus in the students' treasury after all
debts are paid â something that has never
happened before. However, it is a little
early to make broad speculations on the
result, as Morrison has not figured out his
receipts and expenses vet.
The young ladies of Hoble Hall gave a
reception to their friends last Saturday
evening. A dance programme followed.
The cozy parlors of ltoble were crowded

assisted the young ladies in receiving the
guests. Several of the Varsity football
players were present and received a great
deal of attention. Charles FicsertT the

LACKAYE IN A NEW ROLE
He Makes a Hit at the Baldwin
in "Dr. Belgraff," a Hyp
notic Play.
"The New South" Revived at the
Columbiaâ Scenic Eff3cts in " The
Midnight Alarm.*'
Wilton Lackaye made snch a hit with
hypnotism in, "Trilby" that he has been
tempted to try another hypnotic role,
and last night, supported by his own
company, he presented at the Baldwin
Theater "Dr. Jielgraff," a play written
especially for him by Charles Klein.
"Dr. BelÃrafT' 1 challenges no comparison
with 'Trilby." Its only resemblance to Dv
Maurier and Paul Potter's work is that
its chief motive lies in the power pos
sessed by a hypnotist over a woman.
Even in that idea, and especially in its
development, Klein probably owes more
to Alexander Dumas' "Memoirs of a Phy
Â«icidn" than to "Trilby," for, like Joseph
Balsamo's, the powor of Dr. Belgraff
over his victim is intermittent, vanishing
almout entirely when h* loses sight of
her, and in the moment? when she is not
controlled she seeks wildly to escape from
his influence. As a drama*"Dr. Beiirraff" is
weir.i, peculiar, almost repulsive at limes, but
it fascinates the spectator by its strong in
terest and marked originality.
The dominating note of iheplay isLackaye's
role. Dr. Belsraff is a German apothecary,
who, after graduating at Bonn, takes up his
aboae in an Enelish village and devotes his
talents to making discoveries in explosives.
He has reaclnd middle ape, always with tne
hopeâ but never ihe fulfillmentâ of making
a fortune from the sale eCVtomething capableof
wiping out an army. Wrapped up in his ex
periments, he has not noticed that his young
sister, Berihfi, has become fascinated by the
attentions of the dissolute Sir Geoffrey Ling
ham, anil his yyes are opened too late to save
Beriha from ruin.
in this condition of things Dr. Bclgraff, who
has been treating Sir Geoffrey's sister, AÂ«nee,
lor nervousness, realizes that he possesses
hypnotic control over the girl. Agues is an
accidental witness to the culmination of a
scene between the doctor and Sir Geoffrey, in
which, while the stage is darkened, tne au
dience is given to understand that the in
censed Belgraff murders Sir Geoffrey. To save
his neck the murderer keeps Agnes under
hypnotic control, and, to do it more success
fully, makes her promise to marry him. His
plans would, no aouot, have succeeded, but
remorse drove him to drink inordinate quan
tities of brandy, and wheu intoxicated he* lost
his power to hypnotize. Seeing that Agnes is
about to tell all she knows Dr. Belgraff finally
commits suicide.
Lackaye lirs rung the changes very cleverly
on Svengali in his second hypnotic character.
The make-up of Belgraff is blonde and ruddy,
and lv the earlier scenes there is un absorbed,
Siudious air about the country apothecary
which is very convincing. The hypnotizing ra
done much Jess melodramatically than in
"Trilby," indeed a good deal of it is suggested
rather than performed with passes."
During the first two acts the doctor is
thoroughly natural and keep* his own person
ality admirably. When he takes to drink he
is more nielod rajnatic and evokes memories of
Svengali more. These are but fleeting, however,
(or Lackaye has a strong grasp on his concep
tion of Dr. Belgrafland taken all in nil gives a
clear-cut interpretation of the simple but in
tensely earnest student who was driven from
one crime to another largely through the force
0/ ciicumstanc.es.
The death scene is peculiar. Dr. Belgrnff
takes poison and goes behind r door to die,
only his red protruding hands being visible.
The policeman seizes the hands to put the
handcuffs on and the doctor falls lorwardâ
dead.
Miss Walnwright gave a pretty, refined ren
dering of tne role of Agnes. " She carefully
avoided anything approaching melodrama
and was very convincing in her simple girlish
Wilton Lackaye in "D*. Belgraff."
fear of the mysterious power which robbed
Jier of her reason and her will. Caroline
Frankliu was intense and fairly satisfactory
hs Bertha Belgraff, and' A.ire- Kvans gave a
very clever rendering of the part of Mary, the
slave.
All the men who took parts of prominence
acted exceedingly well. Joseph Allen was de
lightfully unctuous as the porrpous old family
physician. ('. \V. Couldock w-is an excellent
Squire Kenton. Forrest Koblnson wat Rood
as his son, while Byron Douglas was duly
brutal as Sir Geoffrey. All' Hampton, Good
win's double, was clever in the role of the
doctor's boy.
Wilton Lackaye has surrounded himself with
a clever company and he had nlenty of ap
plause and curtain calls last night. ''Dr. Be!
-graff" is interesting, fascinating even, but it
is not gay. .
At tbe Orpheum.
A numbar of good novelties have been added
to the Orpheum's bill this week. Stuart, the
male Patti, is one of the cleverest imper
sonators seen here for some time. He has all
the mannerisms of the female music hall
artist, dresses sumptuously, and has a great
store of vocal fireworks, which he emits so
carefully and delicately that his voice does
not convey the impression of being falsetto,
although he shows tiiat it is by occasionally
varying the monotony with a remark to a
deep bass voice.
Equilibrists are so numerous that they have
to be very clever H> attract even parsing atten
tion, but the Romulo Brothers gave some ex
ceptionally good work last night and won the
applnnse they merited. Lnngslow, another
new comer, who is billed as the Shooting Star,
gave a skilitul exhibition of fancy shooting
while balancing himself on the slaclswire, and

Grand Opera-Houge.
"The Midnight Alarm" was put on last night
at Grand Opera-house. The indi
cations of approval which greeted the produc
tion were sijns that It caught on at once. The
various sensational scenes which it contains
were made' the mo?t of, and when a train of
cars, "the express," rushed across the draw
bridge, which had been closed only in tbe
nick of time to prevent it from falling Into
the river, and thÂ« villian of the play, Silas-
Carrtnpford, is baffled, the enthusiasm was
unbounded. Throughout the evening good
work was heartily applauded.

liams and K. J. Heron were" particularly well
received.
Tivoli Opera- House.
Lecocq's comic opera in three acts, "The Lit
tle Duke," was on at the Tivoli Opera-house
last evening for one week's run. The special
requisite for a successful performance of this
merry little work is that it shall move briskly
and with vivacity; due attention, of course,
being paid to the rendering of the leading
melodies. The principalsi ncipals and chorus attended
to all this very we.l and, as the costumes were
good and the stagija; all right, the evening's
performance was very pleasing throughout.
The part oi the Little Duke was taken by Elvia
crox Seabrooke, and Lily Post was ihe
Duchess.
The others were Bernice Holmes as the
Chanoinesse de Lausnc, John J. Kaffael rs
Montalaud, Ferris Hartman as Frlmousse, \V.
H. Vest as Bertrand and Irene Mull as the
governess. The singing lesson produced the
usual amount of fun. -The Little Duke" will
be performed every evening during the pres
ent week.
Columbia Theater.
"The New South." which was revived by the
Davies-Grlsmer company last night, depends
upon the plot and the individuals for interest
and not upon scenic effects or bombshells.
On the whole it was well acted last night and
had the due accompaniment of negro sonns
and dances. Â°

FATHER BRENNAN DEFIES
THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT
The Priest Refused to Close the St. Francis Parochial
School, Contending That It Is in Good
Sanitary Condition.
Ten New Cases of Diphtheria
Reported at the Health
Oifice.
CUTWITTED THE INSPECTOR?.
The Board Is Awn ing an Opinion
From Its Attorney B;fore Pro
ceeding Further.
Father R. P. Brennan, head of the St.
Francis Parochial School, defied the
Board of Health yesterday and opened
his institution of learnine, after it had
been ordered closed by the Hea;th Depart
ment.
Moreover, tbe priest says that he will
continue to keep the school open until
more serious obstacles than those that
have already been placed in his way pre
sent thems9lvi?s.
The Si. Francis School adjoins the Notre
Dame Parochial School, on Sixteenth and
Dolores streets, and in this general local
ity are also situated the Everett, Mission
and Marshall public schools.
These institutions are all in tbe Fourth
District, presided over by Health In
spector Duren, and from this district the
largest iiumber of cases have been re
portet, the majority being scholars or rela
tives of scholars from the schools.
At a recent meeting of tne Board of
Health, after the spread of tbe dread
disease had become alarming, a resolution
was passed declaring the plumbing and
outhouses of the schools nuisances and
ordering the buildings closed.
This of course raised a storm from the
Board of Education and the authorities of
the parochial schools, and.eff.orts were
made to induce the Health Department to
rescind its action, but without avail. The
board was obdurate, and practically stated
that it would not be able to check the
spread of the disease .unless the schools
were closed.
Then the Board of Education, rose up in
its might and defied the Health Depart
ment, passing at a special meeting a reso
lution declaring its intention of opening
the Everett, Mission and Marsh-all schools
to-day.
.Father Brennan said nothine, but de
termined to also defy the medical men.
Many of his pupils were quietly informed
that school would be held yesterday, and
in consequence a large number nf pupils
were on hand at 9 o'clock. The Board of
Health had anticipated such action, and
Inspectors Duren and Millard were sta
tioned in front of the building when the
children began to arrive.
Father Brennan had removed the notice
stating that the* building was closed by
order of the Board of Health, but thÂ°y
made up for tbe less by telling the chil
dren that they must net enter the build
in?. vVithin a short time a big crowd was
on the sidewalk and then the priest put in
an appearance and held a consultation
with a number of the pupils.
The result was a flank movement that
battled the inspectors and won the day for
Father Brennan. He led the way into the
parochial residence, which is adjacent to
the school building, ont the back entrance
and through a sidedoor ot the schcol
where the children were sent to their
classrooms, and tbe business of the day
proceeded as though nothing unusual had
happened. By the time the classes were
cail- tt 300 of tbe 350 scholars who attend
the school were inside.
Shortly after 9 o'clock the Health Offi
cer, who had been. telephoned tor by the
inspectors, arrived md was told what had
htppened.
A council of war was held, nfte'r which
he approached the parochial residence
und asked to see Father Brennan. His
wi. c> was gratified, and the priest came
form, smiling and good humored.
"Are yon holding school to-day in your
residence?" inquired Lovelace.
"Oh, 'no," was tbe answer; "we're still
doing business at the old stand."
That ended the colloquy. The priest
returned to his classroom and Lovelace
came back to town to consult with his su"
periors.
School was heli} in the afternoon with
out interruption, the twq inspectors hav
ing vacated their position.
The mcn;berÃOf the board were as dun. b
as oysters last evening as to wt. at course
they would pursue in the matter of Father
Brennan's deti. . Dr. Morse stated that
there had been no meeting or caucus since
it was learned that the St. Francis School
had opened, but that the attorney of the
board had been asked for an opinion as
to the power of the department tn the
premises, and all action would be deferred
until that was rendered. The board holds
a special session to-day to discuss other
matters, and the opinion Is expected by
that time.
By that time it will be known whether
or not the Board of Education has carried
out its plan of opening the Everett, Mis
sion and Marshall schools, and all will be
taken up at the Â»ame time.
Despite the denial that the board has
come to any decision regarding the St.
Francis School, it is known that a
majority of the board favor strong meas
ures, and that the arrest of Father Bren
nan may follow his refusal to close the
school, provided the attorney of the
board renders an opinion that the power
of trie department extends to parochial
as well as public schools.
Ten new cases of diphtheria were re
ported at the Health Office yesteraav,
largely increasing the alarm of the depart
ment over the spread of the disease. The
cases were distributed over a large area,
but a number were in the infected district
in the Mission that has been causing so
much uneasiness. The new cases were
located as follows: 1108 Vallejo strejt,
616 Greenwich street, two at 116 Lexington
avenue, two at 5% Church street, two at 5
Pond street, 3978 Nineteeth street.
These make forty-seven cases for the
month, an increase of .eight over last
month.
The death rate is not so great, owing, it
is believed, to the more general use of
antitonne serum by local physicians.
There were only three deaths uf unst six
for last month.
"The iirst objection made to this
school," said F.ttner Brennan. after the
field was clear, "was that the closets were
not in good condition. -They are not
patent closets, but they are in excellent
condition, being flushed twice a day. The
objections made were puerile and were
soon overcome.
"Then they *aid there was danger from
contagion. Well, every pupil suffering
from diphtheria and returning to this
i-chool has been accompanied by a certifi
cate from a competent physician pro
nouncing him or her well and free from
all taint of the disease.
"There is absolutely no reason for try
ing to close this school. The board lias
taken a mistaken stand, but evidently in
tends to d oggedly stay with its position.
We held school here to-day, and we are
going to do the same thing to-morrow.
"1 have consulted a competent attorney,
and he says the board has no more risbt
to place a notice on the doors of a parish
school than on a private residence. I
had good authority for tearing it uown.' 1
Members of the Board of Education
stated yesterday that there had been no
change in ihe programme of opening the
Everett, Marshall and Mission schools,
and that the Board of Health could take
whatever action it pleased.

THOSE DEEDS
The Counsel for the Heirs
Want to See More
of Them.
Delmas & Shortridge Claim to
Have Fulfi.led the Order
ot Court.
It Is Arranged That They Be Sub
mitted to a Full Inspection
in Court Tc-Morrcw.
The Craven deeds to the Sansome and
Mission street Fair property are doing
very well in sustaining the interest in the
late Senator's estate that was wrought up
by the famous pencil will.
Reuben H. Lioyd had submitted a mo
tion belore Judge Slack complaining that
the order of the court callinir upon Delmas
& Shortridge to produce the deeds for the
inspection of the attorneys for Mrs. Oel
richs and Virginia Fair had not been
obeyed. He asked that the court issue a
peremptory order requiring the attorneys
V io produce the deeds in court.
I When the matter came up yesterday
Â¥ morning Mr. Lloyd was disposed to have
' the matter continued until Friday. Ha
said that since the application for the or
der haa been made several photographic
copies of the deeds had been taken and
civen into the hands of the experts en
gaged by the counsel for the heirs, Messrs.
Ames auc 1 . Carvalho. He also learned, ho
said, that an inspection of the original
document had been promised for Wednes
day morning, and therefore he did not
desire to push his motion at preseat, say
ing that if the promises were fulfilled he
Mould withdraw it altogether.
Mr. Brutain, representing Delmas &
Shortridge, objected to either a con
tinuance or a withdrawal. He was pre
pared to show, he sa d, as a neuter of law,
that the court had no power to make an
order of examination except where there
was prooi offered that it was a matter or
necessity. Tuis had not been done.
Judge Slack expressed the relief that
there had been unnecessary delay. He
sa;d he saw no better way than to order
the papers into court and then decide
what to do wirh t em.
Hrftiain insisted that he would like to
be iieard, and accordingly the court s<:t
the matter for the afternoon at 1 o'clock.
At ttiat hour Judge Den&on presented a
number of counter affidavit?, settin. forth
that every facility had been offered the
coun?-ei on tue other side to inspect and
photograph the deeds, even more so than
the court haJ ordered. The affidavits
were made by Stephen Roberts, W. S.
Jones J. L. Ross of Taber's photographic
studio, and Attorney Brittain.
The affidavits being admitted George
Knight sprang to his feet and declared the
proceeding a farce. He said the order of
me court had been wholly disr -garded
and not only that, but the counsel had
been treated very uiscourteously at the
photographic stuJio. He further said %he
order outiht to be made as ne feared the
deeds would be destroyed or done away
wita before the case came to trial.
â¢"It the painstaking care ol the counsel
for Mrs. Craven can avail," said Mr. Short
ridge, "1 can assure the counsel that
these deeds will be at band and in cvi-
W^ deuce when the case comes to trial."
1^" Mr. Brittain said the remarks of Mr.
Knight were entirely out of place an I
besides were riot true iv fact. He i-aid
the experts, Mes>rs. Carvalho and Ames,
bad been shown every courtesy possible;
had been allowed to inspect the deeds and
been furnished with photographic copies,
and no reason existed for suspecting their
perfect honesty in the matter.
"Yes," said Knight, hotly, "you al
lowed Carvalho and Ames to inspect the
deeds, but you first tied them up in an
ironclad coutract, which they were re
quired to sign."
"1 have only to say that that statement
is false in every particular," said Brittain
coldly.
The matter was concluded finally by an
order being made by consent that the
further examination of the doeas, which
was to have been held in the office of
Delmas & Shortridge, would take p. ace in
Judge Slack's courtroom on \\ ednesday
afternoon, Delmas & Shortridge reserving
the right to except to any other experts
save Ames and Carvalho, and also pro
viding that the deeds be not taken out. of
their custody.
A BISHOP ON BISHOPS.
Rev. Dr. Newman Sayi He and His
Brethren Must Submit to the In
flexible Appointment Rules.
Bishop Newman made an informal ad
dress at the M. E. preachers' meeting yes
terday on the subject of tne inside work
ings of the Board of Missions, and the way
in which appointments are made. He
and bis brother bishops, he said, were
subject to inexorable rules as to the
itinerancy. A bishop, on receiving an ap
pointment, could no more back out of
accepting it than a member of the itiner
fancy could. Bishop Newman showed
ihat for his own part he had been the re
cipient of five or six other offers of ap
pointments in different parts of the Union,
but that be bad chosen California.
On motion of Rev. Dr. J. B. Hammond
a resolution was adopted in which pro
found appreciation wa3 expressed of the
presence of Bishop Newman as an active
tactor in Pacific Coast Methodism. Dr.
Bovard reported that the petitions in re
gard to pool-selling at Emeryville had
been prepared and sent to the different
pastors in Alameda County to obtain sig
natures. At the close of the meeting
nost of the pastors present signed the
petition.
Prof. Sturge of Japanese mission read
an interesting paper on Buddhism at the
J'resbvterian Ministerial Association. The
life of Gotama ata-t his doctrines were
described, and in touching on the belief in I
transmigration the professor said that our
Lord's disciples evidently did not know
whether to believe in transmigration or
no*, for they asked : "Who hath sinned, ,
this man or hia parents, that he was born !
blind?" "If it was through his own sin j
he must have sinned in a previous state of j
existence," said the professor. The lee- j
ture concluded with the statement: "How
immeasurably is the light of tue world
superior to ttle light of Asia!"
Rev. 8. H. Willey, D.D., the only re
maining member of the organized board
of trustees, addressed tne Congregational
Monday Club on "The Founders of the
College of California and Our Inheritance
in their Labor?." He described now the
grounds, buildings, etc., at Berkeley,
which in 1855 belonged to-tne Congrega
tionalists, had been donated to the State
lor the establishment of the college. In
vjÂ»Â« discussion regret was expressed that
V' effort had not been made to keup the
Cylege in its original denominational
lorm, though general approbation was
expressed at the way in wlricu the State
University is conducted.
To-nigtit there will be a meeting of the
Church Extension Society at Simpson Me
morial Church to consider City methods
of work. Arrangements will also be made
for the auuual" dinner and the annual
meeting. Bishop Newman will be pres
ent and Captain Goodall will preside. -
The Woman's Mutual Improvement
Club, of the Deaconess settlement wi:l
hold ti saie of work on Friday afternoon at
530 Sixth street.
Bishop Newman will address the Union
Ministerial rape ting next Monday at 10:30
a. m. His subject will bo "The Reforma
tory Forces of Christianity."
On Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
next a Christmas Emporium will be held
at Park Congregational Church, Y. M. C.
A. building, at the corner of Fell and
Baker streets. The various booths will be
under the management of Mrs. Rogers,
Miss Merritt, Mrs. Cooper, Mrs. Orr. Mrs.
Sweetser, Mrs. Eirl Schwartz, Mrs. Cum
mings, Mis=i Boobar, Miss Johnson, Miss
Cornish, Mrs. Maule, superintendent
King's Daughters; Mrs. Fred Hatch and
Mrs. Hogan.
On the 17th inst. there will be a sale of
work for the benefit of Olivet. Congre
gational Church. Seventeenth and hoe
streets.
A CHANCE FOR THOMPSON.
The Train-Wrecker Now Under Sen
tence of Ueath Given a New
Trial ou Technicalities. ,
W. H. Thompson, who was sentenced to
death for the part he tooJc in the train
wrecking on the Southern Pacific Com
pany's line at Koscoe Station, Los Angeles
County, Februarylo, 1594, will have a new
trial. The date of his execution was
originally fixed ior May 22, 1896. Before
that time his att6rney filed an appeal
which held off the execution. Now
Thompson will have another chance for
his life.
W. H. Thompson, otherwise known as
"Kid" Thompson, ana Alva Johnson were
concerned iv ditching thÂ« train, or at least
they were together for the purpose of
holding it up. The testimony in the lower
court was that Johnson threw the switch
which caused the locomotive to be ditched.
Masters, who was in the engine cab, was
killed. The train remained on the track.
Johnson was sent to State prison for
life and he is serving out his sentence.
The attorneys for Thompson have made a
de-perate light for his life.
Once before lhompson was in the Su
preme Court seeking a new trial, but a de
murrer was sustained. The charge against
him was derailing a railroad train and un
lawfully boaidmg the same to rob it. The
court found thatlhere was really only one
offense charged, "because the probable
or at least possible effect of each act is to
wreck a train."
Some parts of the opinion were very in
teresting. It wns se; up that upon former
appeal the court was. considering the de
murrer alone, and of course understood
the information to charge that the defend
ant boarded such a train. At that time it
was-not an operating train ana couid not
huve been wreefced- Therefore when the
defendant boarded the train to rob it the
act couid not by any possibility have con
tributed toward wrecking the train.
This would not necessarily have pre
vented the conviction of the defendant, so
I the opinion continued. He coifd still
havo been convicted and punished for
throwing a switch for the purpose of
wrecking the train. The evidence was
sufficient to sustain a conviction upon
that ground.
The court granted the new trial solely
upon the ground that the jury was errone
ously instructed in the trial court. Jus
tice McFarland alone dissented from the
decision gran line the new trial.
NEW HIGH SCHOOL PLANS
A Round Dozen of Them Sub
mitted to the Board of
Education.
Members Who by Their Votes Show
Themselves in Favor of a Tem
porary High School.
An adjourned meeting; ot the Board of
Education was held las: evening to receive
plans for the proposed Mission High
School.
The several propositions were as follows:
McDougall Brothers, $136,700; Laist &
Schwerat, $137,000; Wiiliam Mooser &
Son. $137,000; Vi A. de Prosse. $136,900;
Smith <fe Freeman, $136,020; T. P. Koss,
$127,200; Rowell& Wilson, $130,390; W. O.
Banks, $136,548; William Casey, $137,400:
C. J. Havens, $136,960; W. Jones Cuthbert
son, $137,000; Cahill & Condon, $137,000.
It was decided to examine all the plans
and drawings by daylight so as to admit
of a fair comparison of all the offers, and
tne time was fixed Tor 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning. All the parties interested were
requested to be present for the purpose of,
as President Scott said, "showing that
each plan was superior to the others."
Leave of absence was granted io Miss
Harriet E. Warden oi the John Swett
Grammar to March 1, 1897; Miss Alice L.
Derrick of the Columbia Grammar to De
cember 15; Liliie Goodman, Marshall
Primary, to March 1.
President Scott vacated the chair and j
cailed Director Clinton to preside, after
which he moved to reconsider the action
of the board at the previous session in re
gard to thÂ« Mission High School. The
motion was carried and then several mem
bers wanted to Know what it was all
about, and in order to enlighten the in
quiring members the clert read the reso
lution which had been voted down, which
was that the Mission High be established,
located in the Hawthorne school building
temporarily, and that Charles^H. Murphy
be appointed principal.
When a motion was made to adopt the
resolution Director Comte declared that
he was a friend of Mr. Murpny, but that
there are times when duty is greater than
friendship, and believing that the board
had no power to apooint a principal for a
prospective school any more than it has to
purchase furniture and supplies for a
school building the foundation of which
has not yet been laid, he moved to refer
the matter to the City and County Attor
ney for bis opinion as to the power of the
board.
Director Carew did not believe that
there is any need lor another high schooJ,
and thought that what this boaid did in
the matter would be undone by the next
board.
Director Knox thoujrht that, if the mat
ter went to the City and County Attorney,
at the rate that official was giving opin
ions one would be received in 1898, when
the members of the board would be offi
cially dead.
Superintendent Babcock supported Di
rector Comte, and thought that if the
board could do what the resolution called
for it could save the next board a
deal of labor by appointing at this time
the substitute teachers for the next two
years.
The motion to refer to the City and
County Attorney was lost by the following
vote: Ayes â Ambrose, Carew, Clinion,
Comte, Murdockâ s. Noes â Barrett, Haw
ley, Henderson, McElroy, Knox, Soperâ B.
Scott absent.
Finally the matter was laid over until
the next meeting.
After adjournment of the board the
many frames were uncovered, and those
who remainod saw the different archi
tectural ideas of what a high school
should be. _^_____ _________

liams, the forger and ex-convict, was yester

Explanation.
The arrow flies with the wind. The top figurea
at station indicate maximum temperaturo for the
days: those underneath It. If any. the amount of
rainfall, of melted snow in inches and hucdredtbs,
during the past twelve hours. Isobars, or sclld
lim-s, connect polns of equal air pressure; Iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature. The
word "hitrh" means high barometric pressure and
Is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers 10 low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather'and rains.
"Lows" usually first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure Is high in the Interior
anJ low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain U probable;
but when the "low" is inclosed with Isobars of
marked curvature, rain south of Oregon is improb
able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coast, warmer
weather ni&y be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these condition!
will produce an opposite result.

NEW YORK. N. V., Nov. 30.-Tradlng at the
Block Exchange to-day, as usuol of ' late, was en
tirely professional. In the early dealin- s th<Â»
market was barely steady, but subsequently on
moderate selling the leading issues yielded frac
tionally. The selling was based on the poor show
ing of tbe Pennsylvania system for Octcbsr, a
belief that the returns of the Western roads for
the fourth week of the current month will be un
favorable on account of tbe snow blockades and
lower cables for American securities from London.
Later on the active issues improved slightly, the
< ct< ber statement of the St. Paul uaving proven a
lot better than generally expected.
Forthemomh named the decrease in net earn
ings was 9297,413. The road was operated fa*
63.72 prr cent, against 50.46 per cent for the cor
responding peiiod in 1895. In the last ho.ir of
business the traders became more aggressive.
Sugar and Jersey Central were the objective
points. The last named was raided down from

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, lit., Nov. 30.â The wheat market
was strong for a pan of the morning, an easier
tone' then becoming prominent and prices slump-
Ing from the early high points. Liverpool cables,
which were from unchanged to Va'l higher at the
opening, and light Northwestern receiptsâ 4oo
cars, against 770 last Monday -and 1542 a year
agoâ caused the initial hardness in the ton;, but
the heavy, world's shipments for the, week, esti
mated a 8,3 73, 000 bushel-, kept buyers from dis
playing too much enthusiasm. Receipts at Chi
cago were 15 cars, and i;stÂ». 339 bushels were
taken from store. * The amount on ocean passage
increased 240.000 bushels. The visible supply
decreased 1. 057,000 bushels. When it was potted

ply Increased 27Â«>,000 bushels. ; The official reiort
of the world's shipments made the amount 7,500,
-000 bushels, whicn. steadied prices for a time.

ing any Interest in the situation, ilecelpis wera
108 cars, and 105,905 bushels were taken from

: The New York Commercial Bulletin says: "The
scarcity of French Prunes' heretofore has had lit
tie influence on the market, as ; the , majority- of
buyers seem to prefer the California ; fruit at the
comparatively low prices that have prevailed. The
Imports of French Prunes so far this season are
about double the quantity received during the cor
responding period a yenr ago, but still tall much
short of the average for the past four years. It is
reported thai tne shortage in the supply of small
size California Prunes may result In the revival of
the importing of Turkish, and that the deficiency,
of large sizes will be mad* up by France- Nothing
definite on this point can I be learned, but it Is un
derstood that several of the steamers now in the
Mediterranean loading Dried Fruits for New Yore
may when they arrive be found to have a quantity
of Turkish Prunes in their cargoes." ' '-

to Take Part.
The Elderly Children Have Been SuJb-
dued at Reharsal and Are
Ready for Examination.
Oaklanp Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 30, 1396. )
Society has decided to come to the res
cue of Rev. Edwards Davis of the Central
Christian Church. Next Friday night
I. W. McClymonds, Who Will
Inspect the Ssho^L
many of the best known elderly ladies
and gentlemen will take part in a novel
entertainment for which they are now
making the necessary unique p repara
tions.
The entertainment will take the form of
"the Cross Roads School under inspec
tion," and it is under the charge of Mrs.
Ada Van Pelt.
The programme consists of a class of
thirty who tate the part of schoolchildren
Captain Thomas Will Teach How
to Spell "Yacht."
and who wili endeavor to be as they were
fifty years ago, for the purpose of helping
a worthy cause.
â¢ Captain Thomas will take the place of
teacher and his class will consist of people
Dr. A. Cornwall Will Try to Re
peat the Alphabet Correctly.
who will no doubt find it very difficult to
wear short pants &s they must do for the
occasion. Dr. Cornwall. Pastor Davis'
aged father, Judge Gibson, Colonel Hus
sey, Dr. Pratt, Mr. Zucher, William
Melvin, Harry Melvin and many others
equally well known will show their pro
ficiency by singing the scale and pronoun*
cinq their alphabet correctly and spelling
without mistakes, and repeating the mul
tiplication lable.
Mrs. M. K. Blake, Mrs. Zucher, Mrs
Blake-Alverson and many other ladies
will take the part of the girls, and from
what is known in this city of their dra
matic ability it is certain that they will
prove fully equal to their parts. At a re
cent rehearsal tne affair was so absolutely
funny that several of the elderly school
children required severe reprimands be
fore they would attend to their duties, but
Mrs. Van Pelt says she now has confidence
that by Friday nitrht, when the show
comes off. there will be little or no need of
strap, rattans or other instruments of ju
venile toriure.
City Superintendent of Schools J.McCly
monds will take the role of inspector, ana
as ne is a candidate for re-election by the
next School Board it is safe to say that he
will do nothing to hurt the feelings of
those scholars at least who have voted
these twenty years.
Many amusing features will be intro
duced, and while the pro ramme is not
yet fully completed enough is known to
insure a roarinc time.
Rev. Edwards Davis is a programme in
himselt. He has not yet confided to his
co-workers just what his specialty will be
for the occasion, but there is no doubt
that whatever he undertakes will be
original and well done. The last rehearsal
will be beld Wednesday evening, and in
the meantime the in any artists are busy
preparing their enchanting costumes. It
was originally intended to call the affair
an old folks' concert, but besides being
somewhat of a reflection on some members
of the company the name was entirely too
unattractive, so "The Cross-roads School
Inspection" wa3 decided upon.

OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 30.â The Ala
meda Assemblymen held a caucus last
night at the residence of Judge Wayrnire, :
in Alamed.u It is solidly Republican and

A Brother's Generosity Over a

From the Estate.
Ludger Pinsonneauit Is Badly Put to
Rout by a Plucky Little
Oakland Mother.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Nov. 30. $
"Will yon give me half of the estate?"
said Mrs. Edward Rivest of this city to
Ludger Pinsonneauit of Contra Costa a
few months ago.
"I will do nothing of the kind," said the
old farmer.
"Wili yon give me $1000?"
'â¢No."
"Will you give me $500?"
"No," was the reply.
"Will you give me $100 if I will with
draw my claim to tha estate?" said the
little woman.
"No," was the gruff answer.
"Well, make me some kind of a decent
present and we will call it square â give
me something."
But the old farmer was obdurate and
simrjlv replied: "Not a thing."
"Then I wiiltake the matter into court,"
said Mrs. Rivest, "and fight the matter
out there."
This made the old man laugh, and he
replied sarcastically: "I do not consider
you have any claim; you can do as you
please.'"
. She did as she pleased, took the case
into court, fought theolti man, who might
have bought her off with a new dress, and
a decree of distribution in her favor has
just been.entered in the Superior Court of
Contra Costa County.
Old Ludger Pinsonneauit is left with
nothing but the memory of hia bad bar
gain.
Seven months ago.Proper Pinsonrieault,
a well-to-do farmer of Contra Costa,
died in San PtdJo. Many years ago he
took into his family a little girl named
Marie, now Mrs. Rivest. After the death
of Pinsonneauit his brother Ludger wa3
appointed administrator of his estate.
It was to him that Mrs. Rivest, the
adopted daughter of the dead farmer, ap-
Dlied for what she was informed was her
rightful inheritance. Ludger denied that
she had ever been legally adopted, and
consequently that she bad any right to
her foster father's estate. For several
months Mrs. Rivest could not produce
the legal proof of her adoption, but re
cently, with the aid of Attorney Darwin
de Goiia, she was able to n>ake her proof !
of adoption absolute and complete, and on j
this evidence she was legally awarded
old Prosper/s estate.
The administrator not only lost the
estate through bis Denuriousness, but he
is also out $100, which he spent on his
dead brother's tombstone in opposition to
the advice of his attorney, who told him
that $100 would be a sufficient sum,
whereas the administrator aiagnanimouslv
paid $.'OO. J
The sight of the costly tombstone which
bears a tribute of affection from the living
brother to the dead one caused much com
ment among friends who well knew both
Prosper and Lud er. For twenty years
prior to Prospers death the two brothers
had not spoken, and Ludger's generosity
was only explained when it beearao known
that the tombstone was bought with the
departed brother's money.
These facts were shown ro the court, and
also the information given that Ihe ad
ministrator's lawyer had advisi-d Ludger
not to be so iavish in regard to his broth
er's grave, aud on this showing the court
allowed $100 only and directed that the
excess should be turned over to Airs. Riv
est. As it has been spent Administrator
Pinsonneauit not only lost the estate but
must dijr up $100. "
And all this because he would not make
a simple gift to Mrs. Rivest out of what
was really her own.

Fight Over Gas Stock.
OAKLAND, Cal., Nov. 30.â The iegal
right over the gas company stock, valued
at $45,000, owned by the estate of the late
James P. Rynders, came up before Judge
Greene this morning. The stock was not
mentioned in the inventory or the estate,
because it was claimed by the eiecuior
that it was given as a Christmas present
to Mrs. John Scott, wife of the executor
and niece of the deceased. After hearing
much evidence Judge Greene invited all
parties concerned into his chambers,
where the matter was farther discussed.
Mrs. Scott stated that on several occasions
Rynders tola her he would give her the
stock, and when it was handed to her the
tender was witnessed by i er husband and
Emil Frick, but she could not state defi
nitely at what hour of the day it was
given her.

FIREMEN IN TROUBLE.
Foreman Borkheim of Beacon
Company of Berkeley
Resigns.
C.useil by the Refusal of the Town
Trustees to Honor a Bill for
Supplies.
BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 30.â There is
serious trouble in the Beacon Hose Com
pany No. lof West Berkeley. S. H. Borli
heira, business manager of the West
Berkeley Gazette, who has been the fore
man ev9r since its organization, has re
signed and affairs in the company are in
a most unsettled condition. It all came
about because tbe Town Board at its
meeting last Monday evening refused to
honorabillof between $3 and $4, which
was presented by Borkheim for supplies.
Not having the support of the Town
Board the foreman decided that the best
place for him was outside the company,
and so the next morning he offered his
resignation. Since that time the com
pany has been without a leader, and
though they responded to the fire which
destroyed Danny Land-egan's iwo-story
saloon building last Saturday morning
they refused to haul the hosecart back to
its building, and so left it and all its fire
extinguishing appurtenances just where
they got through wish them.
This extraordinary proceeding aroused
the inquiry of all West Berkeley. Every
one knew mat the members of the com-
I any turned out in a body and that they
worked vigorously, but wera at a loss to
know why they lÂ«ft the hose lying in the
street. Next morning the cart and ho-e
were hauled back to the firehouse by the
town wagon. Inquiry into the case has
disclosed the fact that the members of i:n>
company would not act because they did
not have a leader, and that by such a
movement they would cast a shadow of

and because of the former difficulties ot a
similar nature which have arisen between
the various hose companies and the, Tru
stees. The company will make this a test
case, and will endeavor to rind out just
what authority the foreman of a company
has and has not with rogard to the order
ing of supplies.
The resujt of the present difficulty will
be far-reaching in its effect, since there
are seven similar volunteer fire companies
in Berkeley, all oi which are governed by
virtually the same laws and have the same
relations with the Board of Trustees.
It 13 thought that the long disputed
quesdon of electing a Fire Chief in iJerke- ,
ley. to have control over all the com
panies and to be under the direct super
vision of the Town Board, will be brought
up again before the present fight is at an
end.

EXCITING SPORT
AT INGLESIDE
Three Favorites and Three
Outsiders Took the
Purses.
9
The Two- Year-Old Lincoln II
Again Gave the Talent
a Shock.
Red G'enn Finally Scored a Win.
Preston Again Galloped In.
Arrczzo Beat Sly.
The card for the opening day at Ingle
side fully warranted the large attendance^.
It atoned in a way for many days of cheap
racing. weather was just a trifle
warmer than for some day 3 past and the
track fast and velvety. As the programme ;
looked as though it might be a hard one \
to pick the bookmaking fraternity was ar
rayed in full force in the ring, eighteen
layers of odds mating up prices. It
proved one of those "split-even" days so
often heard of, three favorites and three ,
outsiders getting the purses. ( With .possi
bly one or two exceptions the finishes
were all of the driving sort. , .
That incorrigible youngster Lincoln II
bobbed up again, furnishing the surprise i
of the day. It all happened in the mile
purse event for which Salisbury 11, carry
ing 106 pounds, ruled a 9 to 5 favorite.
Pat Dunne's Damien, with Bob Isora and
94 pounds in the saddle, it was thought
would provd troublesome, but ; receded in
the betting from twos to 7to 2 and was
evidently not much lancied by bis stable
connections. .A stiff play on . Installator
cut his odds down from 15 to 6. Kamsin
was also extensively played at 5 to 1.
At the barrier both Kamsin and Damien ;
Damien acted sour, and the former was
eventually left. Damien started off as
tbougb on ' stilts and might - just as well
ha e ve stayed in the stable. Salisbury .II !
went out with his usual show of soeed and
looked all over a winner until ; sti ight
ened away in the stretch. Here Installator
and Lincoln II began closing the gap and
Jones went to work on the favorite. , He
managed to hold Installator on i the out
side safe, but Lincoln getting through next
the rail beat. him out half a length in
I:4'}^. The winner was overlooked In the
betting at odds of 12 to 1. .
Twelve maiden two-year-olds started in
the opening five and a half furlong scram
ble, with Senator Morgan going out an 11
to 5 choice, backed down from threos. He
had the footing over I. is field almost from
the jump, and in a drive at the end downed
Tryst, a rank outsider, a neck.
With but 94 pounds up the mile and a
furlong purse affair looked a good thing
for Purser's Red Glenn, and ruling a warm
9to 10 choice, he took the lead from Gal
lant before half the distance had been cov
ered, and at ihe wire downed Articus a
length without much difficulty. Tenacity
was a good third:
It is quite evident that Reddington is
not a horse that can be rated. He started
a 7 to 5 favorite for > the fourth race, over
seven furlong?, and never cut any figure
in the running.," Mid.o, with 6 to 1 about
him, was allowed to make all the running,"
and lasted long enough to finish a head in
advance of; Key del I3andidos, who came
from the far rear in the stretch. Alvarado
â was beaten but a nose for the pace. , .â¢
Pat Dunn's Breston again struck a soft
spot in the six-furlong .sprint that .fol
lowed. : He was ulayed from 1 to 2 to 2 to
Sand galloped in a length mul a half, be
fore Ad olph Spreckels, a ? 25 to ; 1 outsider,
which colt ran an exceedingly good race.
Torino was a good third.'. ; *
Gene Leigh sent out quite a likely two
v ear-old in : Arrfzzo, who look the final five
and a half furlong spin for maiden two
eer-oldÂ«Â»; very cleverly. â  Siy, the ,| 6 to 5
vboice, Kacioa and Sooiro went at a heart
breaking clip when Havey sent the bunch
away and raced themselves to death. Ar
rezzo then came alone the last furlong
and beat Sly with ease a couple of lengths,
with Bacina a bang-up third. .
Notes.

terday were : W. J. Torpie, Waldmau &

1 Club, Joe Rose.* Ed. Games, Foxhall Club,"

I Georte Rose and Harry Harris.
Riley Grannan had $2000 bet on Kamsin,
and the plunger thinks the gelding would
have won had he got away from the post.
His -sulking actions nt the barrier, how
ever, did not indicate as much.
Starter Havey sent bis fields- away
nicely aligned, Kamsin alone marring his
work.
The judges' stand has been lowered,
and should Captain Reese perchance place
a horse wrong now how terrible will be
his fata ! Â°
Claude " Burlingarne. * who rode Tryst,
was warned by the judges to see that
in future the black filly showed more con
sistent form. ' The officials do not intend
to tolerate norses being run short to get a
price.
Charley Quinn was reported to have
quit $6000 winner on the day's racing.
Rey del Bandidos. was clearly the . best
horse in his race, and but for being inter
fered with would certainly have won. |

for the following big race to be decided on I
New Year's day, the conditions of which

ARE PROVING THEIR CASE
AGAINST JUDGE HEBBARD
Evidence Introduced to Show That He Broke His Word
to the Depositors' Committee of the ".. .
People's Bank.
An Important Meeting That
Was Held in Judge Heb
bard's Chambers.
A UNION LEAGUE INCIDENT.
Samuel M Shortridge Denounces the
Examiner as a Disgrace to
Civilization.
There was an interesting session in the
Thomas S. Williams libel case before a
jury in Judge Daingerrield's court yester
day.
T. H. McCarthy was the first witness.
He signed the circular which caused the
indictment of the defendant Williams, and
is also under indictment for libel on the
same charge.
SUPERIOR JUDGE W. R. DAINGERFIELD, Who I; Presiding Over the Trial of the
Williams Libel Case*
Mr. McCarthy gave a history of the
court proceedings in the defunct People's
Home Savings Bank litigation, which led
him to believe that Judge Hebbard was
an unfair and improper person to occupy
a seat on the bench of the Superior Court.
He signed the circular which cast re- I
flections on Judge Hebbard, aud alleged
that in managing the affairs of the Peo
ple's Homo Savings Bank Judge Heb
bard had been influenced by Attorney
James Alva Watt and John F. Sheehan.
In explanation of his course in signing
the circular Mr. McCarthy, whose wife
was one of the depositors in tLe defunct
bank, -said that he had culled on Judge
Hebbard for the purpose of having a good
board of directors appointed, but was not
successiul.
.Attorney Henley attempted to ascertain
from Mr. McCarthy the proceedings of
the meeting at which a committee was |
appointed to look after the interests of
the depositors in the bank. It was under
stood that certain resolutions were
adopted at that meeting denouncing
Judge Hebbard for his acts in the manage
ment of the bank's affairs.
Attorney Fooie objected to questions of
this character. He said that such testi
mony would be in the nature of hearsay.
It was not permissible or lawful to allow
a lot of hostile persons to meet and adopt
resolutions condemning a public officer,
and then, when they are sued criminally
or for damages, to plead in justification
that sneh resolutions were passed.
The thing for the defense to do, Mr.
',â -.._ NEW TO-DAY. j

Foote suggested, was to try to prove the
truth of the charges contained inUhe cir
cular, not- to prove that the defendants in
this case and their associates had met and
adopted certain defamatory resolutions.
Mr. Henleyâ We wish to prove that
what is alleged in the circular did actually
take place. - , â¢
The Courtâ You must prove those'mat
ters, but you must not under the guise of
introducing what was done then introduce
testimony on otner important issues- that
â¢is hearsay in its nature. '
Mr. Henleyâ l don't Know how your
Honor cot any such idea in your head.
Mr. Foote â The court has the same
opinion about it as I ha-ve,.
â  The Courtâ When I used the word guise
I did not intend it in its bad sense at all.
Mr. Fooieâ That is the only sense it can
have here, I think.
The Court â Perhaps it was an unforfu
nate word for me to use, but I could not
think of any other to take its place.
Mr. Foote â It fits the case entirely, your
Honor. It is not an unfortunate word at
all. I have my opinion about this.
Mr. Henley â If your opinion comforts
you any you are entitled to it.
Mr. McCarthy was finally allowed to
proceed and testified that the committee
secured the consent of four of the McDon
ald board of directors to resign and that
he, the witness, and H. W. Hutton called
upon Judge Hebbard and told him of the
svillingnes-' of four directors to re?ign if he
would modify his injunction for the pur
pose of allowing them to meet for the pur-
I pose of resigning. They named four good
men to take the place of the four objec
tionable men on the McDonald board.
He said that Judge Hebbard agreed to let
the old board meet in his chamDers for the
purpose of making the change, but that he
did not fulfill his promise
Mr. McCarthy s said that before he and
Mr. Hutton left Judge Hebbard's cham
bers D. M. Delmas and Samuel M. Sbort
r d^e, at that time attorneys lor the Peo
ple's Home Savings Bank, entered the
chambers and Judge Hebbard repeated to
them that be had consented to allow the
old board to meet for the purpose of re
signing.
One or two days later Mr. McCarthy
I said that he saw James Alva Watt, at
that time attorney for J. F. Sheehan, the
receiver for the bank, at the office of Mr.
Hntton.
When Mr. Henley attempted to bring
I out the conversation with Mr. Watt, an
objection was interposed by Mr. Foote.
Judge Daingerfield said that he would
exclude tills class of testimony for the
I present, but would admit it subsequently
it prirua facie proof is offered that Judge
Hebbard had any knowledge of Mr.
Watt's wishes, if he had any.
An exception to this ruling was noted
by the defense.
Witness McCarthy continued by stating
that he called on Judge Hebbard, and
asked him to sel a time when the two
boards could meet to carry out the pro
posed change, and that judge Hebbard
said he had changed his mind and had
decided not to allow the meeting, but
made no explanation of his position in
that matter. He said that subsequently
Attorney D. M. Delmas, in open court,
had taxed Mr. Hebbard with breaking his
piomise; that Judge Hebbari denied it,
and that wi.en Mr. Deimas challenged
him to the proof that Judge Hebbard
I pounded with his fist on bis desk and de
j ciared that he womd not allow the meet
ing as requested.
Mr, Fcote c'osely questioned the wit
i ness touching the occurrences in Judge
Hebbnrd s court and the other matters
pertaining to the voluminou& legislation
in which the bank became involved. It
appeared to be Mr. Fooie's idea to prove
| that the alleged libelous circular was un
i true in status that the Supreme Court
! overruled Judge Hebbard's action in ap
pointing John F. Shi-enan as receiver.
In reply '0 aquation on this point Mr.
McCarthy said: "I understood that the
order of the Supreme Court was a reversal
of Judge Hebbard's order appointing John
F. Sheehan receiver for the bank."
Judge J. C. B. Hebbard was at this point
I called as a witness for the defense. He
t'-iified that he wbb the DroÂ«ecutiniÂ» > wit
i.e>s in tiie case now pending, and that in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 1, 1896.
May. 1894, he received letters in the form
of affidavits from Dr. J. Boushay, H. T.
Graves and A. L. Jenkins offering to re
sign if certain contingencies were cdrn
plied with.
* Attorney Thornton said he offered in
evidence ihe affidavits just mentioned.
Thereupon Mr. Thornton read the vol
uminousn ous correspondence that finally led
to the resignation of the McDonald board
of directors. t>r. Boushay taking the ini
tiative in withdrawing from the manage
ment.
At the afternoon session C. H. Duns
muir, secretary of the Bank Ccrnmission
era, produced a letter from the Attorney-
General in regard to tjie allegation that
Receiver John F. Sheehan had no right to
accept compensation for his services as
receiver, .but the court ruled that it was not
proper to introduce the opinion of the
Attorney-General and Mr. DuDsmuir was
withdrawn.
Samuel M. Shortrid ge testified that the
firm of Delraas & Shortridge Had been re
tained and employed by the bank corpo
ration to serve as its attorneys and coun
sel. The witness told of a meeting in
Judge Hebbard's chambers in which At
torney Hutton, Mr. Delmas, Mr. -Mc-
Carthy, Judge Hebbard and the witness
were present. That was before the motion
to -modify the injunction was made in
open court.
"What was said," asked Mr. Henley,
J 'in respect to the proposed modification
of the injunction in order to permit cer
tain directors to resizn and reorganize the
board ? ' * /
"There had been an injunction granted
by Judge Hebbard," replied Air. Short
ridge, "a sweeping injunction restraining
and enjoininu' tftis board of directors from
(taking any steps or doing any act as ihe
board of directors of that corporation. As
a result of that this interview or meeting
took place to which your question is ad
dressed. The question there was as to
modifying this general injunction so as to
permit the old board of directors to meet
and resign one by one â to rotate a new
I board of directors into office. The parties
I 1 have named, as I recall them, were there,
} and Mr. McCarthy representing, as he was
treated and as I understood, the commit-
I tee of depositors and Mr. Hutton, the at
| torney. On tne other side, tUere were Mr.
I Delmas and myself, technically represent
ing the old board of directors. The ques
tion came up as to the power of the court
to make such a sweeping injunction,' and
I believe I stated that the court had no
such power, and that these men 'might
safely' meet for that purpose and resign,
but they didn't desire to do so. They had
good reasons for not desiring to do so.'[
Mr. Foote moved to strike out the last
sentence.
"Were the reasons stated there at that
time?" asked Mr. Henley.
"I know that they were stated by Mr.-
Delmas," replied the witness. "He ex
plained that the committee of depositors
; had been demanding U>at this board of
I directors resign and dad threatened them
with all sorts of misfortunes if they did
not meet and resign, but that on the other
hand this injunction stood in the way of
their meeting, and they were probably in
curring the danger of contempt proceed
ings if "they did meet and resign, and Mr.
Delmas pointed out the dibrunia in which
they were. The upshot of the matter was
that Judee Hebbard said he would not
I permit them to meet and select whomso
ever they saw fit.
"The subject of the conversation then
turned on how they could agree on a new
board, and the talk ran along until it was
understood and so stated that if the de
positors' committee could agree that the
old board of directors should appoint a
new board, in that event the court would
modify the injunction to the extent that
the board mignt meet and one by one re
sign and induct new members into office. 1 '
Mr. Henley asked whether the names of
any of the proposed new directors were
suggested and Mr. Shortndce replied:
â¢'Whether at that conversation they
I were named I am not positive. It is
| probable that the names of some were
I suggested by the depositors' committee,
i but lam not clear on that Doint. I think
B. P. Flint's of the Olympic Club was men
i tioned later on, and it might have been
mentioned there at that time."
"Do you remember the name of Dr.
Logan having beeu mentioned?" asked
Mr. Henley.
"The namo I know was discussed as a
proposed director," said Mr. Shorlridge.
"I think it was suggested by the deposit
ors' committep. I don't recall whether it
was mentioned at that interview. I think
something was said there as to the mem
bers of the old board having been inter
viewed and having consented to resign.' 1
The witness then proceeded to relate
how he met Judge Hebbard in the
Union League Club on that evening or a
little later. The subject of modifying the
injunction came up. While the3 r were
talking James Alva Watt approached and
took part in the Conversation. TbÂ« wit
ness showed Judge Hebbard the list of
names of proposed directors as agreed
upon between the depositors' committee
and the old board. Among the names
were those of Mr. McDonnell, a druggist on

Grant avenue, Georpe W. Dixon, Frederick
W. Harris and J. J. O'Farrell, then in the
real estate businesson Montgomery strept.
"When they finalh' agreed on Mr. "
Flint, I don't recollect," said Mr. Short
ridge. "Mr. Wilson, cashier or account
ant with Weljs, Fargo & Co., was men
tioned, and, I think the name of Dr. Lo
gan, though I am not sure as to him.
There had been this understanding which
we regarded as an agreement that if the
old board could agree with the depositors'
committee represented at that interview
by Messrs. Hutton and McCarthy, the in
junction would be meditied so as to per
mit the old board to meet and resign and
elect their successors.
"1 met Judge Hebbard in the Union
League Club rooms purely by accident, and
I told him in substance what we had done.
While we were talking Mr. Watt came up
and asked me if there was anything pri
vate about our conversation, and I said
that there, was not. We told Mr. Watt the
subject of the conversation and he joined
in it. I had a list of those names on the
back of an envelope, and Mr. Watt asked
whether I had any objection to giving
him the list. I toid him ihat I had not,
and I read off the names and Mr. Watt
took a pencil and wrote them down. Then-
Judge HebDard moved off toward a screen
that stood there at that time."
ThewitnesÃ then related what occurred
in Judge- Hebbard's court on June 11. Mr.
Delmas, Qn t-he opening of court, very
briefly recounted the unhappy condition
of affairs, the entanglements and 80 forth,
and announced that he was happy to be
able to say that these differences had been
settled, and that in conformity with the '
agreement had with the court, the deposi- '
tors' committee â¢ and the old board i
Of directors in Mr. Shortridge's pri
vate office they had agree.l upon a new ,
board of 'directors. He said that he and
all parties represented in the litigation
were present. Mr. Delmas was on the
point of announcing the names of the new
directors when a colloquy took place "be- i
tween him and Judge Hebbard. In the )
meantime, Mr. Hutton of the depositors' â ,
committee hadarisen and stated the same | .
facts. ' â  . .
On that occasion Judge Hebbard said :
that there seemed to b.e some discontent I
on the .part of some depositors, and he i
took out of his pocket what appeared to ,
be a letter, and stated what some of its
contents were, which were to the effect
that some depositors were not satisfied ,
with the new board. Judge Hebbard said
he didn't propose to sign- the order. Mr. ;
Delmas thereupon restated the proposi
tion-. He called attention to the fact that
both. parties in interest were present, both
seeking to have the injunction modified
only'tothe extent named. Then â¢ Judge
Hebbard repudiated and denied the facts
of the interview in his chambers, and Mr,
Delmas offered to call witnesses to prove
that this matter had been agreed upon in
the Judge's, chamber, but Judge HebOard
told him to be seated. So the matter went
.over and the order was not signed.
Mr. Suortridge went on to say, in reply
to a question by Mr. Henley as to whether
Judge Hebbard did not strike the desk'
with his h'-st and show temper in which
.condition Judges should not be, that he
t-eemed to be angry. The witness did not
remember whether Judge Hebbard struck I
the desk with his fist or not, but said that
the Judge seemed to be very angry.
On the cross-examination by Mr. Foote
the witness said that he had been counsel
for Richard H. McDonald on two or three
occasions. The witness remembered that
atone of the meetings in court Mr. .High
ton appeared, representing two of the old
board. He had a proposition to select a
large number of citizens and taxpayers and
by some kind of an arrangement drawing
a new board from them.
Mr. Foote asked whether the witness
had not drawn $2500 from the bank as the
fee of Delmas <fe ?>hortridge in the cose.
Mr. Henley objected tc this line oi : exam
ination as irrelevant and not cross-exami
nation.
"I am not undertaking to cast any im
putation en Mr. Shortridge, " said Mr.
Foote, "but I want to know if the firm of
Delmas & Shortridge drew some money
out of the bank after Mr. Sheehan's ap
pointment and before he qualified."
Mr. Shortridge, notwithstanding the
objection of the counsel for the defense,
proceeded" to explain the circumstances.
He said: "It was not done with a
knowledge of the issuance of the injunc
tion or of the order. We did get a portion
of the fee that was due us from the bank.
To gratify Mr. Foote's curiosity I will tell
him that'it was stated and misrepresented
by an infamous newspaper in this town
that is a disgrace to San Francisco, To the
State of California aud to civilization, as j
everybody knows."
Mr. Foote interrupted the witness at
this point and objected to any remarks
about newspapers.
"Tho matter is on the records of the
bank. I presume yon have a transcript of
the books in your possession," continued
the witness.
""You had a contract with the directors
of that bank as to your fee?" asked Mr. j
Henley.
"Yes," was the reply.
Mr. Henley objected to the questions on
this subject.
"I am not here to make any explana
tion," continued the witness, "because
there is nothing that calls for explanation,
put if it is material for counsel or the jury
in this case to know anything about it I
am willing to state all the facts."
Mr. Foote objected to any statements by
the witness on that subject.
"I wish to goon with this matter a little
further," continued Mr. Shortiidge.
"I object," said Mr. Foote.
"The questions you propounded to me,"
continued the witness, "are susceptible of
a wrong impression."
"1 don't place that interpretation upon
them," said Mr. Foote.
"I do not wish to be further misrepre
sented by an infamous ann lying news
paper, and I shall not stand it. I want no
wrong inferences drawn from your ques
tions, Mr. Foote," said Mr. Shortridge.
The court remarked that there was no
occasion to go into any explanation. The
records showed all the facts and every- |
thing was plain, so there was no necessity
for the witness to explain.
The court adjourned until 10 A. M. to-day.
After the adjournment of court Mr.
Shortridge was asked as to the identity of
the newspaper which he characterized as
a disgrace to San Francisco and to civiliza
tion, and he replied :
"The Examiner is the paper to which I
alluded. Everybody knows that it is a
disgrace to this City."

LAUNCHES RACE
TO GOAT ISLAND
The Amy and Athlete Had
Quite an Exciting .
Contest.
After a Nip-and-Tuck Race the
Amy Won by Over Ten
Lengths.
Uncle Sam Is Hunting Up Sealing
â  Ciptains to Serve as Witnesses â¢
in Seizure Cases. ' .-.[ -\
The question as to who own3-the smart
est gasoline launch in the 'bay 'is still in
doubt. George A. Knight, the well-known .
attorney, has always claimed the honor
for his fast little boat, the Athlete, but
since Henry Peterson's Amy bedt 'tn"e
crack by ten lengths last evening the ques
tion has been reopened. . Hitherto' the
Athlete has distanced every boat of her
class in the bay, and very few of the
fast steam launches. could hold their own
with tier, consequently when Mr. Knight
is out for pleasure he always wears a miu-
iature rooster in his button "hole and is
ready for a brush with- anything in the
bay. Only a few days ago he was racing
one of the Pacific Coast Steamship Com
pany's smaller boats and was easily beat
ing her. The noted- attorney put "his head
out of the window -to offer the captain of
the other boat a tow when a wave broke (
aboard that washed. him into the engine
room and nearly swamped the Athlete.
By good seamanship Mr. Knight pot vis
boat about and save up racing for that
day. â¢:".''
"Charley" Peterson is "ship's husband"
on the Athlete and Henry Peterson is
the owner of the Amy. Many a time the
former has beaten the latter,- but then the
Amy was never pushed. "Charley" was
â¢â¢'blowing" about hia boat and dared Cap
tain Wilson of the. Amy to race. The lat
ter took him up ana Henry Peterson went
in his boat and Attorney Knight in his to
see fair play. Th.c start was from the
Foisom-street steps and Captain Silovich
of the tug Vigilant was refere- and judge.
Th.c course was around Goat Island and
during the first half of the journey there
I was noÂ£ live feet between the two vessels.
Rounding the island it was still nip and
tuck, but on the home run tne Amy gained
a slight advantage and finally reached
Foisom-street wharf ag"ain aoout ten
lengths in front of -her adversary. .The
tug Vigilant and the wlrarf were crowded
with sightseers and. three hearty cheers
were given for the winner as she moved
up to her mooring lines. Both launches
were in perfect condition, so the 'est was
a fair one, but, nevertheless, Mr. Knight
is not satisfied that the Athlete cannot
beat the Amy. Captain Wilson holds a
different opinion and HÂ«ury Peterson is
wiping to back it, so the chances are'that
another race. may take, placa next Satur
day or Sunday.
"Charley I ' Peterson is tne only discon-' |
solate man in the crowd, as he -lost $10 on
account of the faith he had in ths Athlete.
A sketch was made showing the launches
I at the hnish with Angel Island in the dis
tance. At the time it was almost slack
water and the vessels off the north end of
Goat Island had just begun to swing with
the tide.
Matters in sealing circles will boom in
British Columbia before the month is out."
During the last season nine British vessels
were seized by American revenue cutters
arul ordered to report at Victoria. This
they did and now there are nine suits for
damages averaging from $15,000 !o $10,000
each pending in the British Columbia
courts. In order to present a cood case
Uncle Sam wants all the witnesses he can
find. Secret Service Agent N. R. Harris
I of tiie Treasury Department has been en
gaged on the matter and has secured sev
eral sealing captuins who will go to British
Columbia to testily. Among the number
is Captain Alec McLean, and he will tell
all he knows about British methods in
Bering Sea. Captain White of the Ep
pinger was also asked to go, but as all the
i United States would guarantee him was
$5 a day and his expenses he decided to go
to sea. The Eppinger is ready to sail on
a wintc cruise an-.i Captain White will go
out in her. Other captains will only go to
Victoria on the understanding that they
are back here in lime to sail on tbo next
spring cruise.
Captain Thomas Dowdell resumed his
old position as chief offiier of the Oceanic
Company's Alameda yesterday. It is just
about four years ago that, during a hurri
cane, he was washed into the scuppers and
had one of his legs and his arm broken.
He wai brought to San Francisco and
patched up and is now as good aa new.
No more popular officer ever served on
the Alameda and the reception he received
when he took up his old work yesterday
was a flattering one. Chief Officer lien
nie, who was fiiline Dowdell's place, has
laken charge of the Zealandia, now at
Martinez.
The British ship Granada had a narrow
escape lrom fire last Saturday. Captain
Korff had been suffering from rheumatism
and a fire had been kept in his cabin
morning and night. The heat set the
lining ot the cabin on fire and soon there
| wus a blaze. The hose wasquickly turned
on and in a few minutes all danger was
over. Captain Korff went to a hotel and
a few dollars will make the Granada as
good as new.
