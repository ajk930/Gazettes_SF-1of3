ENTHUSIASTIC
Local Leaders Gather in
a Monster Mass-
Meeting.
M'KINLEY GREETED AS
STANDARD BEARER.
The Vast Auditorium Crowded
to the Very Doors Last
Evening.
THOUSANDS TURNED AWAY
DISAPPOINTED.
Tbe Most Brilliant Opening of a Cam
paign Ever Known in the
State of California.
Never in the history of the Republican
party in California was more enthusiasm
shown than at the formal opening of the
Republican campaign at the Auditorium,
Eddy and Jones streets, last evening.
By 7 o'clocfc thousands of peop'e had
crowded into the spacious building, and
by 8 a squad of six policemen, under a
sergeant, had its hands full turning away
hundreds of people for wnom there was
absolutely no room in any part of the
house.
Those who came early Trere fortunate,
for they seemed seats, wtile their tardy
brethren were compelled to stand in the
aisles, lobbies or in the wings Â«n the stage.
A 8:30 o'ciocic admission was absolutely
denied on account of the crush, and
dozens of ladies were turned away with
the throng of members of the sterner sex.
These ladies pleaded earnestly for admit
tance, but as there was positively no
room even for them to stand in the aisles
the guardians of the police were obdurate.
The sergeant in charge of the police
stated that his men had turned away, at
8:45 o'clock, more than four times as
many people as the hall would accom
modate.
inside of thÂ« hall tne scene was impos
ing. Pit, galleries and stage were crowded
to tneir utmost extent and in the lobbies
ladies and gentlemen craned their necks
to see what was going on at the center of
attraction â the stage. Here were grouped
the lights of the meeting, orators and
their wires and friends and dozens of the
loaders of the Republican narty all bent
on doing honor to the National leader of
the party, William McKinley of Ohio.
Everywhere his portrait was in evidence.
In the center of tne stage near the foot
lights a huge engraving, d.ajjed with the
National colors, met the eyes of the vast
audience and near each wing similar like
nesses were seen.
All around the gallery the familiar fea
tures looked benignly down on his friends
and seemed to lend inspiration to the
speakers as they were introduced by Chair
man George A. Knight. The stage was a
bewildering array of stylish bonnets, ani
mated and intellectual faces when Major
Frank McLaughlin, as chairman of the
Republican State Central Committee, in
troduced George A. Knight as the chair
man of the evening.
The major's remarks, though brief, were
received with enthusiasm, particularly
when he referred to the fair friends of the
Republican party present and glanced at
a box on the left of the stage where- were
seated Susan B. Anthony, Rev. Anna B.
Shaw, Nellie Holbrook B!:nn, Mrs. A. A.
Sargent and other prominent woman suf
i ragists.
Mr. Knight was greeted with liberal ap
plause. After returning the appropriate
thanks, he said that from the time the
Republican convention met at St. Louis
there bad never been a question as to the
result of this election. Much had been
said of the crime of 1873, but the crime of
1892 wai greater, when a good President
was let ant of office to make way for a
party which nad been convicted of every
crime from imbecility to grand larceny."
The speaker paid a well-merited compli
ment to the audience, when he remarked
that he saw before him one of the most
intelligent audiences it had ever been his
lot to face.
An intelligent man in the gallery
shouted. "That's so; every timel" and
the audience, being intelligent, applauded
the infinity of tbe suegestion.
Judge B. B. Carpenter was the next
speaser. His subject was "The Crime of
1873," and be poked considerabie fun at
the claim of the Democrats that the
financial act of 1873 had been passed with
out the knowledge of Congress and had
been signed by the President without the
President's knowledge. He said that the
matter had been debated during three ses
sions of Ccneress and that those debates
occupied 196 pages of the Congressional
Globe. Every Senator and every Repre
sentative from tbe Pacific Coast had voted
for it Senators Sherman and Morrill
voted against it because they did not wish
to concede the one-fifth of one per cent to
the Pacific Coabt Yet, in spite of these
undeniable facts, a Senator from the Pa
cific Coast had been going around the
country saying that thing was a crime.
The speaker contended that there was
not a civilised country on the earth that
did not recognixe the value of gold as com
pared with the value of silver.
"They tell us," he added, "that silver is
the coin of tbe poor man, as they told us
in 1892 that mutton was the beef of the
poor man. I don't know what they will
do with silver, but I hope that they will
treat it better than they did mutton.
They have destroyed one- third of the wool
crop of America, and it is to be hoped that
they will succeed better with silver."
With reference to the phrase "The dol
lar of Jefferson," the speaker said that
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
Patriotism, Protection and Prosperity
ROUSING INAUGURATION OF THE CAMPAIGN IN SAN FRANCISCO.
Enthusiastic Rally of Republican Clubs and Other Members of the Party at the Great Auditorium Meeting Last Night,
Where the Issues of the Day Were Eloquently Presented by Logical Orators. v
the fact was that Jefferson had directed
the Superintendent of the Mint to stop
coining silver, and for thirty years
not a silver dollar was coined in the
United States. Why don't they huwi
about that "crime"? Webster, Ben
ton, Clay and others fixed the ratio be
tween silver and gold at 15.98 to 1, but it
was found that they had undervalued sil
ver, and the result was that all the silver
went out of the country and nothing but
gold was left. From 1863 to 1873 there was
not even a quarter of a dollar, a half a
dollar or a dime coined, so tnat in 1873 we
must have demonetized something that
we did not have in circulation.
The speaker said that silver was re
monetized in 1878. Up to 1873 $8,000,000
in silver was coined, and since 1873 $41,
--000,000 was coined. Grant and Sherman
and Gttrfield made the third arrangement
of the finances of the country, and now
come Bryan, Altgeid and Tillman â
[hisses] â to provide for free and unlimited
coinage of silver. [Laughter.]
John P. Jackson was the next speaker.
He beean by saying that the Republican
party is not in favor or cheap money,
cheap labor or free trade. [Applause.]
Whatever has been done for silver has
been done by tbe Republican party. It
has coined $427,000,000 of standard silver
dollars, which are a legal tender for all
debts and dues, public and private, to any
amount, including duties on import".
It has favored silver over and above all
other money. For instance, national bank
notes receivable for all dues are not re
ceivable for imports. Greenbacks are not
received for duties on imports, whereas
silver certificates and silver dollars are.
The Republican party has coined as
many silver dollars as could be held on a
parity with gold. It is a curious coinci
dence that the same party that coined
$35 ,000,000 and sent it out to other coun
tries and had it returned to their hands by
the coolies of China and Japan had a coin
less in weight and compelled the working
men of this country to take it for their

; day's wages, when the heathen have re- i
fused to accept it as such. We bay* gold, !
silver and paper, good here and in Europe ;
and everywhere all over the wide world;
good to-day, sood to-morrow and good as j
long as Republicans rule.
The speaker drew an illustration that
evoked applause. He said that when
Irving M. Scott is about to build an ocean j
steamer he goes to a bank and asks for '
$2,000,000. The banker says: "Certainly,
Mr. Scott, you may have $2,000,000. We
have $4,000,000 on hand. Don't you want '
the other $2,000,000?" Mr. Scott says: :
">To; I have no use for it. Give me
another steamer or another gun to build
â¢ad I can use it."
After two sones by the California quar- j
tet Irving M. Scott was introduced to |
speak on California's prosperity depend- i
ent on a protective tariff.
Mr. Scott began by pointing out the
wide area of this State, the variety of its
productions and its climate nnparalleled
by that of any other country in tbe world.
This magnificent empire will give its vote
for McKinley and protection.
"In ail the wide land of America," con
tinued Mr. Scott, "no State of the Union j
as early as California recognized the full
and equal rights of womankind and wrote
in the statute books of California that in
community property she was the full
equal of man.
"Twelve years before Thornycraft of
England made a boat that could go eigh
teen miles an hour the Meteor, built in
California, had made a record on Lake
Tahoe of twonty-one miles."
A tribute was made to the American I
schoolhouse. It was a monument of in
telligence. He had circumnavigated the
globe, and he had found that nowhere on
all the earth were the people so well
clothed, so well fed and so well housed as
were the American people.
-Will you give up this prosperity."
asked Mr. Scott, "to follow some unset
tled; uncertain idea that poverty has bred
in the States where the grasshopper and i
SEN.GC PERKINS
the cyclone have devastated? There is no ]
more danger of defeat now than there wr.s
in 1860 or in 1864. Shall you swap plenty
for misery; a growing industry for an
undemocratic idea? Will you give up
California for Kansas or Nebraska?
"Why should we when we raise almonds,
figs, olives and raisins allow a â¢single case of i
foreign eoods to enter our ports so long as \
there is a single case of our own goods un
sold? Farmers, mechanics, laborers and
merchants all stand on the same plane.
If you give us protection to start the
wheels of industry going we Will take care
oF any kind of money under the skies.
Major McKinley said a short time ago, 'It
is better, fellow citizens, in my judgment,
to open the factories of America to our ;
people" than it is to open the mints of |
America to the silver of tbe world.'
"There have been times of prosperity
under high protection and disaster and
death under low tariff and free trade."
Mr. Sco t was enthusiastically applauded
at the close of his remarks.
Ex-Senator George C. Perkins, the next
speaker, after bowing his acfenowledg- ]
ment to a tumultuous burst of applause,
proceeded to compare the fate of the Ke
public under Republican and Democratic
regime respectively.
"From the time that the Democrats last
came into power," said the eloquent ora
tor, "the people commenced to ask each
other whether a great mistake had not
been made. On the day of Grover Cleve
land's inauguration the heavens wept a
rain of tears over the folly of the Nation."
He expressed in masterly fashion the
sophisms of the Democratic speakers, who
attribute the "hard times" to Republican
laws, and said time would not permit him
to review the turns and windings through |
whicn the Democracy had wended its
devious way in order to arrive at ultimate
disaster. A detailed history of the Wil
son bill and some of its calamitous effects
was given in lucid, telling terms. He
said be had beard no one defend it by
any logical argument, though they were
- â Â»" S.M $HP_RTB | OGB
to be found who could defend the course '
of Judas Iscariot.
The speaKer then gave a clear statement i
of the financial status of the Nation under i
Republican administration as compared
with Democracy and in a brilliant peror- i
ation called for the support of every voter |
for the Republican ticket during the com- i
ing campaign.
Samuel M. Shortridge was next intro
duced and spoke as follows :
Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I
don't know how you feel, but 1 simply know j
that McKiniey will be elected President" of tha
United States. [Applause.] I know that be- |
cause the record of the Republican party is â 
such that the American people believe in it !
and Know, if they know anything, that the re
turn of that party to power is the coming back
to us aiain of prosperity, of progress and of
happiness.
I have Deen assigned the pleasing but most
difficult task of recalling briefly the history of |
the Republican party, which history, as sug- i
gested by the subject, will show why that ;
party should be trusted in the promises it
mnk-9 to the American people in this year ;
1896.
i will ask any Democrat here, and there may j
be some seeking light [laughter], which they ;
will have found, I am sure, in the speakers of ;
the evening, who have preceded me â I will
ask any of the citizens here assembled, I will j
ask the people of California, and I would ask
the people of this whole land, what promises
the Republican party ever made that it dia
not keep, even unto the letter? What prom- â 
lses in all the history of the Republican party
has it failed to keep? Beginning forty years
agoâ besinninff forty years from thisâ lÃs6,
when it nominated its first candidate, General
Fremont â frbm that time down to this moment i
it has been faithful to its promises, and its
record ia the brightest page in the history of i
tbe world.
We did not succeed in electing that great, j
good, patrioti c pioneer, but four years later, !
up from t he ranks of the people from the prai
ries of Illinois, out from the people, a part of
them, there rose up the man, pure, simple,
plain; the man who loved liberty with his j
whole heart and his whole sonl; there rose up
the man that the American people rallied
round, and they, and perhaps you, selected as
â  the first Republican President our, your and I
R O^CARPEfKTeS
the world's benefactor, the Immortal and be
loved Abraham Lincoln.
And the Republican party took possession
oi the reins of government. It is an oÂ»d story.
It is known Dy experience, by Jhe (tray-haired
men, and if gray hairs ever adorn the brow of
woman by the gray-haired womenâ it is known
to you oy experience the condition in which
the country wai in IB6o*- What the Republi
can party did then was in the interest of the
Union; in tbe interests of the constitution; ia
the interests of men; in the interests of
women â and from off the brow of liberty it
took, that thorny crown of slavery and it
placed there the crown of dignity and honor
forever.
The Republican party found this country
torn apart, found her credit gone, her treasury
empty, her commerce swept from the sea, her
induutries prostrated, misery and want and
desolation throughout the breadth of the coun
try; it found this great land of ours so dis
turbed that there was every prospect of Na
tional destruction; it found tne ship of state,
to use a homely metaphor, which was laden
with fill the hope and the precious liberties of
the people almost foundered and sinking in
the sea, and under the guidance of Abraham
Lincoln, with the assistance of the immortal
Grant and that of Seward and the other com
patriots of that Cabinet, the Union was saved
and the credit of the Nation restored and the
industries revived.
The war over, and peace blessing our coun
try, we entered upon a period oi prosperity
never before known in any country and never
before equaled in this. And until a moment
of weakness, in a moment of foolish belief in
the vague notions of the Democratic party,
not until a weakness came over the people, did
this prosperity cease, did the industries of this
country receive a blow that has almost proven
mortal; not until the Democratic party came
into power did the progress of this country
suffer a check and the industries a blow which
has almost been mortal.
Whatever during the thirty years the Re
publican party promised to do, 1 assert history
has recorded its performance. Its promises it
has keptâ kept them to tbe poor, kept them to
the laboring man, kept them to the North, kept
them to the South, kept them to all portions
of tnis country, and so keeping them it is
proud of its record, and ia not ashamed to

CANTON, Ohio, Aug. 22.â The moat
notable political demonstration of the
campaign occurred here to-day at noon,
when 1200 voters from Newcastle, Elwood
and other points in Lawrence County, Pa.,
arrived on two special trains and, enliv
ened by the music of two bands, a drum
corps, a calliope and a brass howitzer,
marched up to the McKinicy residence to
visit the Republican candidate for the
Presidency. The delegation was made up
of workingmen, mechanics and farmers.
There weie also present a hundred or more
old soldiers.
A great many banners bearing inscrip
tions were borne in the procession. One
read: "We want our factories -tar ted, not
rich mine-owners made richer." Another
said: "Sixteen to one â sixteen men out of
Work for oue who has it." And another
had this inscription: "Give us back the
prosperous days of thf McKinley tariff."
The visiting delegation could not find
standing room on the spacious McKinley
lawn and scores of people had to remain
in the street. It was several minutes be
fore Colonel Oscar Jackson of Newcastle,
a former colleague of Major McKiniey in
Congress and the spokesman of the visit
ing delegation, could mue himself heard.
His speech was cogent and at times elo
quent. Among other things he said :
We consider the mucn-talked-of moneyques*
tion a false issue, raised by designing men for
selfish purposes. Republicans are not asking
for auy change ia this respect. For many
years we htve had good money and we only
want it kept good.
We claim in ail mat is best to occupy a lead
ing place among the great nations of the earth.
Undoubtedly then we should have money that
is recognized as the best the world ove<*. WÂ«
are not the people that should go back to
cheap, poor money, and when that question
does come up we want all we have "to be good,
equal to the best."
When Major McKinley stepped on a
chair to address bis callers the cheering
burst forth again. After it ;,ad subsided
Major McKiuley delivered one of tUe most
earnest speeches that has fallen from his
iips. His voice was in excellent condition,
and he spoke with a fervor tbat wad mag
netic and moving. He spoke as follows :

lost none of their devotion to the great princi
ples of the Republican party and that this
year they will give to the Republican National
ticket an unrivaled Republican majority.
[Cries of ; 'VVe will do that right."] Nor urn I
â¢urprised, my fellow-citizens, that this is so.
We have had three years of bitter experience
under a policy which the Republican party
has always opposed, and there has been noth
ing in that experience to win us to that policy,
but everything to increase our devotion
to the old policy of protection which stands
opposed to it. [Applause.] I was glad to meet
my distinguished friend, Colonel Jackson,
with whom I served in the Cengress of the
United States, and to again hear his eloquent
voice, as I have often heard in the halls of the
National House, speaking for the great doc
trines of the Republican party, the success of
which involves the highest prosperity and
welfare of the American people. [Cheers.]
My fellow-citizens, tthe earnest thought of
the people this year is directed to the present
condition of the country and how best to im
prove it. This is the thought of every mind
and the prayer of every soul. Nobody is satis
fled with our unfortunate business condition,
ani the great body .of the people want and
mean to have a change. What shall the
change be? Shall it be the continuance of the
present Democratic party under another lead
ership? [Cries of "No, no."] A leadership ad
vocating all the policies of the Democratic
party which kave been injurious to the Amer
ican people and rejecting all which are good,
wholesome and patiiotic an 4 which have re
ceived the approval of the people of the coun
try? cheering and cries of "No."]
The wing of the Democratic party which con
trolled the Chicago convention is just as much
in favor Â»f free trade as the wing of the Dem
ocratic party in control of the National ad
ministration. [Applause and cries of "That
ii so."]
Most of those prominent in that convention
were conspicuous leaders in the assault upon
our industries and labor made by the Fifty
third Congress. They are devoted to this un-
American and destructive policy, and were
chiefly instrumental in putting upon the stat
ute books tariff legislation which has destroyed
American manufacturing, checked our for
eign trade, and reduced the demand for the
labor of American workingmen. [Loud cries
of "You are rightl"] It stands opposed to reci
procity, too, the splendid results of which
were so signally manifest during tbe adminis
tration of President Harrison. [Applause.]
The Deople of this country have condemned
the policies of this party, in these particulars,
in every election since 1892. [Cries of "Thai's
so!" and applause.] They are only waiting
sow ior a chance to register again, and all
along the line unitedly express their opposi
tion to this free trade heresy in the general
election next November. [Applause and cries
of "We can hardly wait tiil the election,
Major!"]
It there was, therefore, but one question
other than that of protection against free trade
we have it just as sharply drawn and us dis
tinctively presented through the Clreago con
vention wing of the Democratic party as we
had it through the united party in 1892, and
a triumph this year for the Chicago platform
would be a signal victory for free trade and for
the continuance ot free-traSe legislation,
which has already resulted so disastrously to
the American people and entailed upon the
Government deficient revenues and upon the
people diminished trade abroad and starvation
wages at home. [Cries of "That's v so."] This
wing of the Democratic party believes not only
in free trade but it believes in free silver at a
ratio of 16 to 1. [Cries of "Down with free sil
ver."] Having diminished our business they
now seek to diniinisn the value ot our money.
Having cut wages in two they want to cut the
money in which wages are paid in two; and
we will not have either the one or the other.
[Tremendous cheering and cries of "Hurrah
for McKinley."]
The other wing of the Democratic party is
patriotically standing for the public honor
and is oppose! to free silver because it be
lieves that such a policy would disturb exist
ing talues, contract the currency of the coun
try by depriving us of the use of gold and
putting us upon a silver basis, thus creating
widespread panic and bringing to every
American interest serious injury.
My fellow-citizens, will the people turn to
that party for reliti whose policy has created
the conditions under which we are suffering
and from which they are crying out to be re
lieved? [Renewed cries of "No, never."] What
we want now is business activity and con
fidence. With business conlidence restored
money will invest in private and public enter
prises, and when so invested labor will be
V well rewarded and the toil of the husbandman
will be fully requited. [Great applause]
Without confidence, money will be hoarded
and the wheels of industry stopped and what
that means many of the men before me know.
[A voice "We have lived on sunshine too
long."]
Then the farmer, the merchant, the manu
tacturer, the laborer and those of other useful
occupations alike will suffer. Gentlemen, con
fidence lies at the f onndation of active and
successful business operations. We cannot re
store confidence by a proposition to debase the
currency of the country and scale down puolic
and private obligations. Such a proposition
strikes at the very life of credit and business.
It makes it harder to get money for legitimate
and worthy enterprises by deliberately pro
posing to pay back what has been already bor
rowed iv a depreciated currency. [Cries of
"You're right."] The people, irrespective of
party, will unite in defeating a financial
scheme which will confiscate the partial earn
ings of labor in the savings banks and build
ing and loan associations and the investments
of the people in insurance companies; and I
don't believe that the American peopiewill
ever consent to have the pensions ot our sol
diers repudiated by a single farming. [Great
cheering and applause.] The people want
neither free trade nor free silver. [Cheers.]
The one will degrade our labor; tbe other our
money. [Applause.] We are opposed, unal
terably opposed to both of them. We have
tried the one in a modified form with disas
trous results to every American home, and we
are strongly opposed to making an experiment
with the other. [Applause.]
My fellow-citizens, the people have a chance
this year to take the Wilson law off the statute
books and put a good American protective
tariff law in Its place, [Cheers and cries of
"They will do that all right,"] which will pro
vide adequate revenues for the Government
and gladden the home of every American
workingman. [Cheers.] They have a chance
this year to prevent a free silver law from
going on the statute-books, and thus keep our
money of every kind now in circulation as
good as gold and preserve our National name
above reproach. [Cries of "They will do that,
too."] If they don't improve the chance, they
will not have such another opportunity for
four years. Dues the workingman, the farmer,
the manufacturer want the Wilson law to re
main on the statute-books four years longer?
[Loud cries of "No, no."] Do they want re
ciprocity which will give us > foreign market
for our surplus manufactured * ad agricultural
products to remain off the 6iatute-books four
years more? [Cries of "No, no."]
Do they want any law enacted which would
compel them to receive for their wages and
products dollars worth less than 100 cents f
[Cries of "No."] These are questions which
every voter in the country must answer in his
conscience and by his vote next November.
Gentlemen, what shall the answer be ? [Cries
of "Elect McKinley," followed by tremendous
cheering].
I thank you most heartily for this call, for
your expression oi good will and for the assur
ance which Mr. Jackson has given me of your
unfaltering support of Republican principles
It will afford me sincere pleasure, I assure you,
to meet every one of you personally. [Ap
plause and cheering.]

CHICAGO, 111., August 22â Police
Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt of New
York was a visitor at Republican N/ftional
headquarters today. He is going to -his
Dakota ranch to rest To a reporter for
the United Associated Presses he said:
"New York State will give McKinley the
lareest majority that any Presidential
candidate ever received. The only ques
tion is whether the party will get a major
ity in New York City. Tammany is not
giving the Democratic ticket enthusiastic
support. The workingman, whether in tbe
factory or on the farm, is the man who will
suffer most if we should have a 50-cent
dollar and he is growing to realize this.
Our factional difference will not interfere
in the least with the polling of a tremen
dous Republican vote. The revolt of de
cent Democrats against Bryan has reached
most remarkable proportions."
Hon. H. Clay Evans of Tennessee, who
has been making speeches for McKinley
in Indiana, is expected at headquarters
next Monday. In a letter to Perry Heath,
receive 1 to-lay, he says: "We are having
some fine fun in Tennessee just now at
the expense of the Democracy. The Gov
ernor has had to call a special session of
the Legislature to meet on September 7
for the purpose of raising funds â raising
the tax on the people â to provide against

FLAG-KA lSi\G DAY.
Major JUeKinleij Sc.aa Good Advice to

WOODSTOCK, CpNN., Aug. 22.â At a
flag-raising to-day under the auspices of
the Woodstock McKinley and Hobart
Campaign Club there was a large attend
ance and enthusiastic speeches were made.
Among the letters read was the following
from Governor McKinley:
Canton, Ohio, July 25, 1896.
To Clarence W. Bowen, Esq.: I nots with
much satiiaction that the Republicans of
Woodstock intend to be among the first to
start the campaign ball rolllnc. Our friends
must not flatter themselves that the Republi
can party has an easy task before it, I have
no doubt whatever as to success, but in order
to make the victory thorough and emphatic
there is need of earnest, persistent and intelli
gent wcrk. Probably never in the history of
the Republican party has there been a greater
necessity for a campaign of education and or
ganization. Very truly yours,
William McKinlet.
REPUBLICANS
ENTHUSIASTIC.
f Continued from firU Pagt. I
turn the book of history thHt you may tee
what it promised ahd what it has done.
i have not the tnue i:or you the putience to
go into the details of the legislation of the las:
thiny years. Let me suggest, however, ti at
the Republican party said that it would give
homes to the poor, that it would give the
homestead to the pioneer, and it is due to the
Keniblican party that the beneficent home
stead law was passed and kept on the statute
book.
The Republican party said that the credit of
this Nation should be kept up, and it was the
lowest among the nations of the earth. But by
its effort* it ni :de thatcredit the be*t in all the
world. Why, you remember the expenses, the
extraordinary expenses, of carrying on the war
required tho borrowing of a vast amount of
money, and during some periods of the war
you will remember the fear of failure was such
that the greenbacks sank farther down
in the scale and were farther below
par than ever before known. But
the honesty of the American people
and the integrity of the Republican party
said then and says now, Mr. Altgeld, Mr.
Bryan, Mr. Tillman and all these demagogues
to the contrary notwithstanding, that the
promises of this Nation shall be kept and that
for every dollar we have borrowed we will re
turn 100 cents.
But above all this what I would address mv.
self to is this promise which the Republican
party made. It made a promise that since it
was the party springing from the people it
would give employment to tbe men of this
country in preference to those of other lands.
[Cheers and applause.] Not that we arc op.
posed to other lands unless they come in con
flict with our industries.
We may aamire England for her greatness on
the sea; Germnny for her indu&try and frugal
ity; Ireland for her love of libertyâ we may
admire any land on the earth where the brow
is free and the hand unshackled; but wo do
love this land more dearly and more de
votedly than all countries. [Applause.] And
as stated here to-night by Senator Perkins,
we would rather nee the mills of our country
in full blast and full ope. ration than be -told
that the factories of Germany and France
and England are employlne men.
And so the Republican party, which promised
the men, the women, the boys arid the girls
that they should have an opportunity to labor,
that the mills should run, that the mills
should go full, that men might find an oppor
tunity to toil, has kept this promise by
passing a tariff measure which not only
yielded amplu revenues for the expenses of
government but protected the laboring men of
this country from the poorly clad, underpaid
and less foriunate laborer of foreign countries.
Men who work, men who toil, men whose
daily bread depends upon their toil, men who
have money in the savings banks and those
who desire to have money in savings banks, all
classes of men, know that without such a
tariff there can be no prosperity in tbe United
States of America. So upon that question the
Republican parly's past record is so square
and straight ana manly that it would be an
insult to mention in detail what is known to
you.
Many other questions have confronted the
Republican party, and in every instauce it has
had the statesmen to grapple with the prob
lems to their honor and credit. But, on tbe
other nand. what a miserable, disgraceful and
altogether discreditable record we nnd when we
look to see how the Democratic party has
undertaken to conduct the affairs of this Gov
ernment. No wonder that the Chicago plat
form undertook to turn away from their record
and hazarded wild and new notions.
But the Republicau party has made a prom
iseâgrand old woman, there she sits, grand
old womau [appiause] â the Republican party
has made a promise, and perhaps in the next
election we may have to get upon our knees in
more ways than one and ask not only the
men but the women for their votes.
The Republican party dealt with the tariff
question. It a:so dealt with the subject indi
cated here to-niuht by Senator Perkins, that is
the great question of reciprocity. The Demo
cratic party opposed tariff, i rotectlon and now
opposes reciprocity. The Republicans cham
pioned that; the Democratic party swept it
away. That doctrine of reciprocity that does
not conflict with the tariff, and which admits
free to our country, free the products which
we cannot produce in return for the free entry
into other countries of those things which we
do produce. Tr,e result of this has been most
beneficial to our people. The doctrine of
reciprocity was closeiy connected with another
?ronnse which the Republican party made.
lie Republican party has said that the Ameri
can flag shnll be respected in every State and
in every Territory, and under the leadership
of Republican stateimansh p, under the guid
ance of Republican statesmeu. this flag wag
caused to be .respected if not loved, caused
to be feared if it was not loved In every sea.
Mr. Suortridge then referred to the
patriotic enforcement by the Republican
party of tbe Monroe doctrine in every
case where European parties bad sought
to infringe upon it. He reverted attain to
the policy of reciprocity which Blaitie
had inaugurated and the feeling of friend
ship that had bÂ«en engendered toward the
United States by the republics of both
continents of the Western Hemisphere.
He concluded by saying:
There is not one thing the Republican party
has ever done that it is nsliaaied of; there is
not one act that would cause a b.usli of shame
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1896.
to come to the cheek of any American citizen.
There is not one thing in all Its history which
it is ashamed of or would undo If it had tne
opportunity.
Fellow citizens, if there Is such a thing as
fidelity, if there be such a thing as devotion
to country, liberty and God, is there a party
on the face of the earth to-day that has done
so much for the people as this? This is tbe
party under whose blessed banner l and you
are proud to walk.
The Hon. Tirey L. Ford. Senator from
Sierra County, spoke as follows:
Not in the heat and turmoil of an excited
and excitable convention, not under the hyp
notic spell df impassioned eloquence, was
William McKinley chosen the standard
bearer of the Republican party. From the
quiet of a million firesides, from anxious faces
in tbe workshop, in the factory and in all the
industrial pursuits of a great Nation, came
the ceaseless and irresistible demand for pro
tection's greatest general. Like the onward
flow of some mighty river, the steady current
of public opinion swept aside all obstacles
and yielded not to the skill and energy of
those who would turn it from its true
course. * â¢ *
Citizens of San Francisco and of California:
We ask you to seriously consider the grave and
far-reaching issues of the campaign upon
which we are now entering, and when election
day shall have arrived and you come to exer
cise the highest duty of a citizen we ask you to
vote for the American home and all that it im
plies, for the American laborer in his strug
gle against the sharp competition which a low
tariff has forced upon him, for American in
dustry, for National honor and National pros
perity; in short, for him who typifies all these
and more, William McKinley of Ohio.
The Rev. Anna Shaw was introduced by
Mr. Knight. Miss Shaw spoke as follows:
Mr. President, Gentlemen and Ladies: The
greeting which you have given me to-night is
not for me aloneâ it is the greeting to the
principle, to that plank in tlie platform of the
Republican party which I stand here to rep
resent.
â¢'Mr. Shortridge has given you te record
of the Republican party from its begin
ning to the present hour alung the lines of
finance, along the lines of protection. He
spoke of that immortal hero, tbe man who
set tne pattern of what a Republican
should be, and fixed tbe high standard to
which all Republicans should aspire, the
great leader of this Nation, Abraham Lin
coln.
"This grand man said : 'I believe every
one who bears the burdens of the Govern
ment should share its privileges, by no
means excepting women.' Abraham Lin
coln gave the keynote for the Republican
party and in 1869 a Republican Governor
of Wyoming signed the bill wnich gave
the women of that Territory the ri_ht of
suffrage on equal terms with its men and
put Wyoming in the front rank of civil
ized State<>.
"In 1872 the National Republican p^rty
for the first time recommended the grant
ing of the baliot to tne women oi this Na
tion. This year at St. Louis they up
held the rieht of all citizens to the ballot.
"You of California, it must be remem
bered, set the fashion for the Nation. You
have taken up the cause of half the citi
zens at least as loyal as that which now
wields the ballot.
"The women of California belieye Mr.
Shortridge when he says the Republican
party keeps its promises. We know it
will stand by its solemn engagements.
The men of California will not fail to
crown their sisters and their mothers with
the glorious diadem of citizenship.
"The Republican party will never regret
the suffrage plank in its platform."
The meeting then broke up with three
cheers for McKinley and Hobart and the
singing of the "Star-spangled Banner."
CLUB ORGANIZATIONS.
Officers Eleoted In All of the As-
sembly District Republican
Clubs.
The regular Republican clubs of the sev
eral Assembly districts held meetings last
evening, effecting nermanent organiza
tions and electing officers. In every case
the meetings were largely attended and
the greatest interest manifested in the
proceedings. In several of the clubs there
were Jively contents for the offices.
Resolutions similar to the following
were adopted by every district club:
As the great issue in the present camDMgn
is the protection of American industry and
labor against free trade, nud as protection
gives employment to American workingmen
and prosperity to our country, while free trade
gives employment to workingmea in foreign
lands ana robs workmen in our country of
remunerative employment and the means of
livelihood lor themselves and family, and as
the other issue is sound money against un
limited free coinage of all the silver of rich
mine-owners, not only Ameriaan, but of all
other nations of the earth, and as the princi
ples of sound money give each wage-earner
or business tiian an honest dollar, whether
of gold, silver or paper, and give to the
laborer for a dollar's worth of work a 100-cent
dollar, and as unlimited free coinage of silver
will Â£ive us a depreciated silver dollar,
a 50-cent dollar, and place this country among
the second-class monometallism silver-using
countries, such aÂ» Mexico, India and China,
countries of cheap and depreciated silver
money, of cheap and Dovertj -stricken labor,
and of cheap and degraded men; therefore
be it
Resolved, That we call upon all Republicans
to rally to the support of the regular Republi
can organization of this City and County, at
the head of which is the reguiar Republican
County Committee (C. W. Mawwarincr, chair
man), and to frown down every attempt to
create discord or division.
Resolved, That we call upon all citUens, irre
spective of their former political affiliations,
who believe in protection or Round money, to
unite with us to maintain the prosperity and
the financial honor and integrity of America.
Resolved, That we invite ail Republicans and
all citizens of this district to join this official
club of this district as one of the effective
means of promoting the best interest! of our
country during this campaign.
Resolved, That we heartily indorse the selec
tion of the Hon. John I>. Spreckels as National
Oommitteeman for this State, as his integrity
and character, services and abilities commend
him to Republicans as a leader animated by
patriotic purposes and the welfare of the com
munity and as having the capacity to com
mand and lead us to success.

was to raise the beets necessary to supply
such a factory. To supply the beets nec
essary for such a factory requires an acre
age each year of 30,000 acres, and Mr.
Spreckels asked that contracts be signed
and delivered to him showing tnat the
farmers would guarantee that acreage for
the ensuing two years.
Since that time a committee has been at
work securing the necessary contracts
from tne farmers. The committee has
been greatly retarded in this work by the
fact that many of our large landholders
are out of the State â the largest land
holder, David Jacks, who owns 20,000 acres
of beet lands, being in Europe and could
not be reached by cable â but notwith
standing these difficulties the committee
has worked among tne small landholders,
who signed contracts readily.
To-day an answer had to be given Mr.
Spreckels, and a mass-meeting was called
to make up the balance of the acreage re
quired. The large pavilion was filled with
farmers anxious that the project should
be a success. William Vanderhurst was
chairman of tbe meeting, and speeches
were made by Hon. W. J. Hill, Edward
Berwick, Jam6s Bardin and others. But
the speech of Mr. Bardin was the most
practical. He gave a detailed statement
of the result of his crop of beets raised on
225 acres.
The net yield for the 225 acres was $5950
per acre. He had paid out $4000 for freight
on his beets, which he would have saved
had we a factory at Salinas, which would
have made his net profit about $77 50 per
acre. He clo-ed his address by saying:
"Claus Sureckels can get alongwithout
the Salinas Valley, but the Salinas Valley
cannot get along without Claus Spreck
els."
Great enthusiasm prevailed all through
the meeting. As a result contracts for the
ensuing two years for the acreage required
have been signed and Salinas rejoices over
her future. Already people are pouring
in here from other sections of the State in
search of beet lands, and it is expected
that the population of our town will be
doubled within a year, for all of which
Salinas owes a vote of thanks to Claus
Spreckels. the sugar king and public bene
factor.

The American P ope, Declares the
Orator, Have a Right to Legis
late for Themselves.
BARRYTOWN, N.Y., Aug. 22.â William
J. Bryan opened up the political cam
paign in earnest to-day at Madelin, a town
In Dutchess County. He delivered the
first actual campaign speech since his
nomination. He said, among other things :
We are entering upon a campaign which is a
remarkable one in many respects. Heretofore,
at least in the last twenty-five or thirty years,
each party has gone into the campaign prac
tically solid, presenting a united front against
the opposing party; but in this campaign
there has been practically a bolt from every
convention which has been called. This
means that the people are not so willing as
they have been to allow the platform of a
party to control their elections.
Men are thinking this year with more
earnestness and intensity than they have
been thinking in recent years, aud the result
of this thinking will be manifested when it
Bomes to register the will of this great Nation,
md between that time and this hour we ex
pect to present to those who must act upon the
questions the issues of this campaign. I beg
fou to consider whether the great toilini;
masse* of this Nation have not a right to make
i business out of politics for once and protect
their homes and their families from disaster.
[Applause.]
I have not been in the State of New York
long; I have not met many of your people,
md yet In the short time that I have been
Here 1 have met enough Republicans who said
:hey were going to vote our ticket to make up
'or every Democrat that ever deserted us, and
Xt welcome the coming guests as we speed
ihose who are parting. [Applause.]
It is hollow mockery to grant to the people
. right in your constitution and then deny
hem the privilege of exercising it. I assert
ih&t the people of the United States, those who
produce wealth, as well as those who exchange
t. have sufficient patriotism and sufficient in
elilfjence to sit in judgment upon very ques
lon which has arisen or will ari? -i, no matter
low long our Government may endure. [Ap
plause.]
My friends, I want you to remember that in
lie discussion of this money question there
tre certain fundamental principles, and when
rou understand these principles you under
itand the money question. I was out in a por
ion of the country wbere they irrigate on a
arge scale and I found enormous plants, and
n investigating this the thought occurred to
ne what principle underlies the subject of irri
tation? I;, is that water runs down hill?
When you understand that water runs down
till all you have to do is to dig a ditch with a
lant and you can carry water wherever you
rant it. So it is with the money question,
fou have got to find out the principles which
mderlie the subject, and when you under
tand them you understand the money qnes
lon. What is the principle that underlies it
,11? It is the law of supply and demand,
rhich applies to money ss to everything else.
fou know that if the world's crop next year of
certain article is very much greater than the
rop this year that that article will fall In
Tlce; lf the crop is much smaller than this
ear that it will rise in price. You know that
he law of supply and demand reaches ana
ontrols all sorts of property. It reaches and
ontrols money as well as other forms of prop
rty. The establishing of gold as a sole unit of
alue throughout the world and the destruc
lon of silver as a standard money means that
ou shall destroy the value of all property ex
ept money and investments that call for a
rzed amount in money.
It means that you will give to these invest
lents and to this torm of property â money â
n advantage over every other form of prop
rty. When you understand the effect of the
olioy, and then understand that the desire for
i Is manifested most among those who bold
he flxea investments or trade in money, I
blnk you will come to the conclusion that I
aye come toâ that the faci that the gold
tandard is a good thing for them is the prin-
Ipal reason why they are In favor of a gold
tandard. [Applause.]
Now, my friends, when you make up your
jindi that the gold standard is a baa thing,
hen the only question you have to consider is,
ow can you get rid of itT They can raise ob
tctiocs to the plan which we propose, but I
'ant to suggest that you are interested not so
tuch in knowing the objections to our plan
s in knowing what plans they have to relieve
be condition.
Why don't they propose something? It is
ecause they do not know what ought to be
one. If so they are poor people to lead you
ut of bondage. [Laughter.] Is it because
aey know and will not tell? If so they have
fit the candor that ought to be possessed by
aose who would redeem the people from their
iffering and distress. [Applause.]
My friends, continued Mr. Bryan, I want yon
Â» study this money question for yourselves,
nd I want you to understand if bimetallism
i to be restored the United States must take
Â»c lead. [Applause.] We have waited for
10-e than twenty years to have the benefits
f bimetallism brought to us by those whose
iterests are opposed to ours.
I assert that the American people not only
Â«ye the right but they have the ability to
igialate for themselves on every question, no
tatter what other nations think about it.
Long applause.]
If we need relief, from the gold standard we
lust secure it for ourselves. Aud if we must
tcare this relief for ourselves, you can only
tcure it through a party which believes in
le restoration of the free and unlimited coin
re of gold and silver at the present legal ratio
1 16 to 1, without waiting for the aia or con
mt of any other nation. [Prolonged applause
ad three cheers.] Other nations may protect
teir people, as they should; but our Nation
â¢ the only nation that can protect the Ameri
in people. [Applause.]
\OT Ori'OHElt BY CLEVELAND.
\ttitude of the l'rtsident toward the
Sound. Money Convention.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ixd., Aug. 22.âChair
lan Bynum of the National Democratic
(ecutive committee this morning set at
ist tbe rumor that President Cleveland
Bd written him a letter in which be op
osed the idea of putting a National Dem
:ratic ticket in the field aud urged the
idorsement of McKinley. Mr. Bynum
ud:
"Any lumor to the effect that Mr. Cleve
â nd has written to me or has in any way
â dicated any indisposition toward the
animation of a ticket is utterly without
iundation. Furthermore, this conven
on will, without any manner of doubt,
Dminate a Democratic candidate for
resident and Vice- President upon a Dem
tratic platform. The delegates have been
elected and are being elected under a call
contemplating that purpose, and every
scrap of information or communication
that we have indicates that this will be
done."
Concerning the attitude of President
Cleveland toward the movement, Secre
tary Wilson this afternoon made the fol
lowing statement of the view taken at
headquarters:
"Mr. Cleveland has never given any ex
pression to an opinion as far as tbe leaders
of tha sound money movement know con
cerning the convention at Indianapoli3.
They don't believe that any one is author
ized to speak for tho President. But cer
tainly there has been no antagonism from
Mr. Cleveland or his friends and any one
observing the situation can plainly see
that Senator Vilas, Senator Caffery, Sena
tor Palmer, Senator Gray and such gentle
men are, to put it mildly, not unfriendly
to Mr. Cleveland. In fact, they are closely
identified with him. They are all in favor
of a third ticket. Why should not Mr.
Cleveland be friendly toward the sound
money movement? The Chicago platform
seeks to impeach his personal integrity
and repudiates his political administra
tion, and Governor Stone in his Madison
square Garden speech saw fit to denounce
him as a traitor. The newspapers that
are behind Mr. Bryan are steadily engaged
in the same kind of work. Mr. Cleveland
and his friends are not of the makeup
that kisses the hand that smites them."
The New York people to-day engaged
quarters at the Bates House for a full dele
gation of seventy-two members and fifty
extra people. The Maryland people also
wired for quarters to-day. Their delega
tion will be beaded by ex-Governor Wil
liam Pinckney Whyte and ex-Congress
man Isador Raynor. Telegrams weie
received from North Carolina, South Caro
lina and New Mexico stating that arrange
ments have been made for State conven
tions and the selection of full delegations.
Applications for tickets to the conven
tion are pouring in upon tne executive
committee in such numbers as to indicate
a much larger attendance of spectators
than was anticipated, and it now seems
certain that the hotel capacity of the city
will be fully tested.
MAY START A NEWSPAPER.
Silver Democrats Anxious to Have an
Organ in Chicago.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 22.â The day at
Democratic National headquarters was
largely one of preparation for beginning
the political work next week. Chairman
Jones kept secluded in his room and saw
only a few of the many callers while he
was in the hotel. Among them were a
delegation from Indiana consisting of
Sterling R. Holt, chairman of the State
committee; ex-Congreseman A. W. Lamb
and Judge McNutt.
To a reporter for the United Associated
Press Mr. Holt said: "We will carry
Indiana for Bryan by 40,000. The gold
movement in our State is a great benefit to
us. It is putting our people in line, and
for every Democrat we lose by it we gain
ten Republican silver votes."
The day the National committeemen
arrived in Chicago Chairman Jones ap
pointed Thomas Gaban, on behalf of the
committee, to act in conjunction with
Chairman Cantrell of the State Board of
Warehouse Commissioners, who had been
named to represent the Illinois and Cook
County committees, for the purpose of
ascertaining the cost and other details in
connection with the publication of a morn
ing silver newspaper in Chicago during
the campaign. The figures were submit
ted to Chairman Jones to-day and some
time was spent with Committeemen Gaha n
and Johnson on this business. The busi
ness of starting such a paper will not be
decided until a full meeting of the com
mittee, probably Monday morning. Sec
retary Walsh of the committee will arrive
In town to-morrow. The plan is to start
at once an eight-page general newspaper,
the editor to be named by the National
Committee and the business end to be
controlled by Chicago citizens, who will
subscribe to the stock.
The paper will be subsidised by the Na
tional and State committees and thou
sands of copies distributed by express
throughout the West. It is proposed to
make the price 1 cent everywhere. The
necessity for such a paper in Chicago is
admitted by the committee, but the cost
of printing was found to be higher than
expected. The publication will begin at
once, if decided on, detailed arrangements
having been made with that end in view.
It is likely that a press bureau will be
established in connection with headquart
ers and a local newspaper man of ability
placed in charge, to keep the silver press
of the West thoroughly supplied with
Democratic news.
Dan McConville will be here M onday to
start the speakers' bureau in operation.
Kryan al Washington.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Aug. 22.â John
Boyle, chairman of the local committee

cation meeting to be held in this city, re

ing in which, among other things, he
says: "I will stop in Washington on my
way from the South to New England. I
cannot fix the date."

FIREMEN AT ASTURIA.
Closes After an Exciting
Day's Sport.
ASTORIA, Or., Aug. 22.â The firemen's
tournament was brought to a close this
afternoon after a most exciting day's
sport. The day was uncomfortably warm,
but notwithstanding this fact the streets
were thronged with spectators during the
entire day. The first event was the dry
test contest which was captured by
Astoria in 45 2-5 seconds. Oregon City
second, in 46; The Dalles and Fourteenth
Infantry teams running a tie for third
place in 46 1-5. Liberty of Portland met
with an accident and their time was not
taken.
The make-and-break contest was also
won by tbe local team in 1:261-5; Four
teenth Infantry second, in 1:39; Liberty
third, in 1:53^.
The tenaer race, hub and hub, was won
by Astoria No. 1.
Then came the big event of the tourna
ment, the championship race. The Dalles
led off, making 1:23 2-5, followed by
the Astorians, whose coupling became
jammed, throwing them out of the race.
The Fourteenth Infantry team could do
no better than 1:26, and I:2B>j was the best
that Liberty could place to their credit.
Oregon City was also unfortunate in this
race, one of their couplings breaking
while the hose was coming off tbe cart.
This gave the championship to The
Dalles, a victory which was very popular,
owing in some measure to the fact tbat
The Dalles had previously been unsuccess
ful.
After the racing was brought to a close
a test of the water pressure was made, ten
streams beintc thrown in the air to a
height of 185 feet. The visiting teams
were much impressed by the splendid
water pressure of the new water works.
FAIRFIELD MINOR'S 'SUIT.
Seeks to Quiet Title of Bis Interest in
the Toland Estate,
Cal., Aug. 22.-William
Gridley Toland, a minor, suing through
his guardian, has brought suit in the Su
perior Court of Bolano County to quiet
title in one-half of the lands owned by the
late Mrs. Maiy B. Toland-
The suit is brought against Hugo H.
Toland and other parties, among whom
are the tenants on the property and vari
ous persons supposed to he relatives to
the late Mrs. Toland. The property is
supposed to be worth over $100,000.
In the complaint it is alleged that Wil
liam Gridley Toland, a grandson of Mrs.
Toland, is entitled to an undivided half of
the property. While Hugo Toland, the
other heir, is endeavoring to have pro
bated what he claims is a will of Mrs.
Toland, in the courts of San Francisco, it
is understood that the probating of the
will has been contested and that there in
some doubt as to the validity of its pro
visions, even though it is proved to have
been written by the late Mrs. Toland.
It ia also reported that this suit is
brought on the theory that the provisions
of the will are invalid.
FRIENDLY FAMILY ' SUIT.
Brought to Determine the Ditvotition of
Certain Legacies.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Aug. 22.â
Suit was filed here to-day by Carter and
Pierce, Los Angeles attorneys, against
Mrs. Alice H. Williams to force the pay
ment of $1000 td A. W. Ely and George
Driscoll, sons of Maggie Driscoll, sister of
the late John H. Williams of Naples, and
Margaret Farrar, daughter and only child
of another sister, Eliza W. Farrar. This
is really an amicable suit, brought to de
termine the manner in which the sum of
$5000 left to Margaret Farrar. and two lega
cies of $2500 each left to Ely and Driscoll
by Mr. Williams' will, shall be paid. The
attorneys of the widow claim that the
reading of the will makes them payable
in cash, while the attorneys of the heirs
take the ground that they are to be paid
from $48,000 worth of Government bonds
which formed an item in Mr. Williams'
estate. As these bonds are at 15 per cent
premium, it will be readily seen that the
difference involves a gain or loss of $1500
to the heirs.
SANTA BARBARA SLANDER SUIT.
Outgrowth of Bitter Litigation and
Property Losses.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Aug. 22.â
Gerard Grand has instituted suit for
$10,000 damages against Louis G. Dreyfus
on account of slanders alleged to have
been uttered and published by the latter
reflecting upon the plaintiff. The charges
upon which the complaint is based are
rather trivial in tone, but the suit is the
outgrowth of bitter litigation and property
losses. Mr. Grand was a few years ago a
considerable property-owner in this local
ity. He is a man of industrious and even
frugal habits, but a poor financier, and
having borrowed from time to time in
considerable sums from Dreyfus, secured
on his property, found himself a few
months* ago with scarce one of all his
broad acres left. In his extremity he
bases this suit upon assertions made by
the man in whom he formerly trusted.

la Still Alive.
FRESNO, Cal., Aug. 22,â Joe Silk, a
laborer employed in the reconstruction of
the courthouse, fell a distance of thirty
feet to-day and narrowly escaped death.

yet developed no symptoms of internal in
juries and the doctors think he will re
cover. Silk stepped on the carriage of a
hoist to unload a barrel of cement. The
automatic brake which held the carriage
at the landing failed to catch and when
the laborer stepped on it the carriage
dropped from under him. Silk was
knocked off by jutting t'.mbers and fell to
the cement floor thirty feet below, striking
he^d foremost.

The Williams Suicide.
OAKLAND, Cal., Aug. 22.â Much un
pleasantness occurred over the inquest of
Stanly Williams, the suicide, which was
held this evening.
Tbe widow was brought to the Morgue,
when she should never have left her bed,
and the Coroner and Undertaker Leitch
are blaming each other for the piece of
needless cruelty.
The Coroner said to-night: "I am not
responsible for the bringing of Mrs. Wil
liams to the city from her sickbed. Mr.
Leitch was the undertaker in the case and
I asked him to go out and see how she
was."

Uncertainty Concerning the Great
Political Striie in the

MILITARY MEN SEEM TO RULE
It Is Evident That the Country Is on
the Brink of a Ministe*
rial Crisis.
BERLIN, Germany, Aug. 22. â The
resignation of General Bronsart yon Schel
lendorf from the office of Minister of War
continues to occupy the attention of the
press and the public, and this has espe
cially been the case since the Reichsan
zeiger, the official journal, published the
announcement of the Minister's retire
ment from office, coupled with the declara
tion that the impairment of his health was
the main cause of his withdrawal, fines
this assertion was made a storm of pro
tests has arisen on all sides, and instead
of pacifying the apprehensions of the
opinion that the country is on tne brink
of a grave ministerial crisis, the statement
of the organ has intensified it.
Why, it is asked everywhere, did the
Reichsanzeiger issue such a statement,
and by whom was its publication au
thorized? Within the official circle it is
not known by anybody that the publica
tion of the declaration was assented to by
Prince Hohenlohe, the Imperial Chan
cellor, or by any other member of the
ministry.
If General yon Hahnke, the chief of the
Military Cabinet, obtained the sanction of
the Emperer thus to make use of the of
ficial gazette, it is argued that the Mili
tary Cabinet has obtained control of func
tions which have been hitherto held ex
clusively by the crown and the Ministers.
Rarely indeed has the press been so unani
mous upon any subject as it has been in
denouncing the explanation made by the
Reichsanzeiger of the reasons actuating
General Schellendorf in tendering his res
ignation to the Emperor and in the ex
pressions of opinion as to what it may
portend.
All of the criticisms are clearly fore
bodings of a fateful and stormy session of
the Reichstag, yet the newpapers entirely
overlooked the fact that the chief's of the
Federal States can interfere and check the
action of the Emperor if his Majesty shall
be found to be attempting any radical in
jury against the constitution.
The resignation of General yon Schellen
dorf and the officially reported inten
tion of Prince Hohenlohe to retire do not
appear to comprise all of the Cabinet
changes that may possibly take place.
According to the Leipsic Nauesie Nach
ncten, Admiral Hoilman, admiral com
mander-in-chief of the Imperial Admi
ralty, will be the next Minister to offer his
resignation, which will be accepted with
out doubt.
Upon the occasion of the bicentennial an
niversary of the founding of ttie Berlin
Academy, which occurred yesterday, the
Emperor presented a number of gold med
als to artists who are exhibiting pictures
at the academy this year. A smaller gold
medal was assigned to E. E. Waterlow
and Mrs. Alma Tadema.
Professor Eggling of the Berlin Veteri
nary Coliege is about to start for New
York. The professor is going to the farm
of Robert Kneebes, the American horse
man, to examine the racing mare Bethel,
which it is alleged Kneebes entered and
started on the Berlin course under the
name of Neliie Kneebes. Professor Egi;
lint; goes to America under the instruc
tions of the Criminal Court, which has
postponed its decision upon Kneebes' ap
peal against his conviction and sentence
to nine months' imprisonment, pending
the professor's report. In the meantime
Kneebes wiil have to stay in jail.
COURTEEN SEAMEN PERISH
The Italian Ship Ciampe Sink* the
Schooner Slouette.
LONDON, EKG.,Aug.22.-The ltalian ship
Francesco Ciampe, Captain Maresca, three
days out from Swansea, on ber way to
San Francisco, arrived at Falmouth to-day
showing the eftects of hard treatment.
Her bow plates were badly bent and some
of her frames broken.
She reported that on Tuesday, while off
the Scilly Islands, she collided with the
French schooner Mouette from Iceland
for Fonbrieux. The schooner was almost
cut in halves and sank in a few minutes.
Everything possible was done by those
on the Ciampe to save the crew of the
sinking vessel. Ten of the crew were
picked up and were landed here this morn
ing, but fourteen of tne crew went down
in the ill-fated vessel.
The damage to the Ciampe is not seri
ous, and she can soon be repaired. There
is considerable dispute concerning the
cause of the disaster. Both sides accuse
the other of neglect and of being respon
sible. Ttie condition of the bow of the
Ciampe, and the fact that the Frencii
schooner sank so quickly show that the
Italian ship must have run her down.
OBJECT TO PMItiOX-MADE GOODS.
English TradeM* Union* Protest Against
Their Importation.
LONDON, Eng., Aug. 22.â There is a
prospect of trouble between the Englisn
Government and that of Germany ovax the
extensive importation into this country of
prison-made goods. The trade unions
have been harassing the Government on
this subject for a year past, and consider
able . correspondence has taien place be
tween the Government Board . of Trade
and the German authorities.
The latter have , manifested a decided |
inclination toward standing on, what they
regard as their rights under the treaties
now existing between the two countries,
and it is now authoritatively stated by
Hon. Thorn Ritchie, president of the
Board jof J. Trade and a , member of ; the
Cabinet, that unless an end is put to the
grievance â by friendly arrangement dur
ing the recess the Government imme
diately upon reassembling will . bring in
a bill prohibiting the importation of
prison-made goods from Germany. It is
believed that this would lead to re
taliatory measures on the part of that
country. -- â¢_' -â : .--'

the collision on February 29 last between

La Bourgopne and the Allan line steamer

SECRETARY SMITH TO RETIRE.
Political Reasons Cause Him % to Be
Anxious to Leave Cleveland's
Cabinet,
WASHINGTON, D. C. Aug. 22.â There
is the best reason for believing that tne
Secretary of the Interior, Hoke Smith, has
resigned and that his resignation will take
effect within two weess. Stories of Secre
tary Smith's resignation have been cur
rent in Washington ever since his paper,
the Atlanta Journal, came out for Bryan
and Sewall, but the Secretary declined
and still declines to admit that his resig
nation has been tendered to the President
I and accepted.
The reason of his refusal to talk is that
he is not alone concerned in the matter.
Tne wishes of the President necessarily
rule in the matter of publication. It is
known, however, that Smith has declined
to extend consideration of cases in his de
partment over which he has jurisdiction
beyond the end of August.
Sloreover, the private papers of the Sec
retary and his private library have been,
shipped by express to Atlanta, and his law
offices in that city are being made ready
for occuppucy. The house which the |
Secretary leased in this city during his in- I
cumbency will be given up at its expira
tion early in September, at which time it |
is quite "certain Smith will have retired
from the Cabinet, but this action may not
take effect until after the meeting ot the
sound-money convention at Indianapolis,
which occurs September 2.
ENCAMPMENT OF PYTHIANS.
Eighteenth Gathering of the Uniform Rank
of the Order at Cleve
land.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Aug. 22. â The
eighteenth encampment, Uniform Rank,
Knights of Pythias, opened informally to
nigh 1 and the formal dedication wiil take
place Monday afternoon. Major-General
Carnahan, wlio is at the head of the Uni
form Rank, inspected the encampment,
which consists of 2000 tents, and formally
accepted it. He immediately went into
camp with some of his staff ofheers al
ready on the eround.
The first arrival in camp was the Second
Ohio Regiment, consisting of 6â¬o men,
who reached the grounds headed by a
band at 7 p. m. A few minutes later a
company from Virginia appeared on the
tented field. These are the -only States
represented at present, for most of the
uniformed Knights will not reach here
until Sunday and Monday.
Supreme Chancellor Walter B. Richie is
also in the city. His labors wiil begin
early in the week, when he will call to or
der the Supreme Lodge of the World. Mr.
Richie said that the order now consists of
very nearly 500,000 and is constantly grow
ing, and prided himself on the fact that in
times 01 trouble the military branch of the
order can offer 50,(XK) men drilled in tne
United States tactics.
The Supreme Lodge will consider next
week early the refusai on the part of the
three German lodges in Richmond, Louis
viile and Chicago to discard the German
ritual. Chancellor Richie said that if the
lodges insisted on using it they wiil be
disbanded.
MINISTER TERHELI. TO RESIGN
Thinks Hi* Retirement Mil Be Agree
able to the Department.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 22.â A Fort
Worth (Tex.) special says: It is believed
here that A. W. Terrell, United States
Minister to Turkey, either has resigned or
soon will place his resignation in the
Hands of the President, and within two
months will return to this country. This
information is said to come directly from
Mrs. Terrell, who gave it out, it is said,
not expecting it would oe made public.
According to the story, while the resigua
tion had not been asked for point blank
Mr. Terrell became satisfied it would be
acceptable, and he has acted accordingly.

FATAL FLASHES
OF LIGHTNING
Havoc Wrought by Storms
in Three Eastern
States.
BUILDINGS IN RUINS.
In Chicago Large Structures Are
Targets for the Destruc
tive Bolts.'
SEVERAL LIVES ALSO TAKEN.
In Many Sections of Illinois, Ohio
and Indiana Great Damage
Is Done.
CHICAGO, 111., Aug. 22.â Storms orig
inating west of Chicago last night played
havoc with telegraphs and telephones
throughout the States of Illinois, Indiana
and Ohio 10-day. It was midnight when
the warring elements reached the Western
metropolis and the net result was the
partial destruction of the barns of
the Chicago City Railway Com
pany at Sixty-first and State streets, which
were struck by lightning. A section of
the roof was dashed through the building
to the first-floor, carrying with it the sec
ond and third floors. The loss is $20,000.
The Chicago Brick Company's plant at
Forty-first and Leavitt also was a mark
for lightning at 3 o'clock and the entire
building collapsed, causing a loss of $15,
--000. Iv the southern portion of the city
the damage collectively was great from
fire and water. Fortunately no loss of
life is reported.
Reports received to-night from towns in
Indiana and Ohio are of a similar nature,
the greatest inconvenience probably beine
experienced through the interruptions of
the lines of communication.
At Indianapolis the wind was of hurri
cane force and the rainfall tremendous.
In some of the lower portions of the city
the streets were turned to running rivers
and the street car 3 were blocked while all
other traffic was entirely suspended.
Many farm buildings were destroyed by
fire after having first been struck by
lightning. Near Rome City, lud., Arthur
Foos, aged 14, who was in a barn, was
killed by a bolt.
In the interior towns of Indiana busi
ness houses and residences suffered much
loss from broken glass in skylights and
windows and damage to goods by the
heavy downpour of water which followed.
AtElwood, Ind., lightning demolished
RÂ«v. T. J. NVright's residence. All the
family escaped injury but Wright, who
was horribly burned and paralyzed from
the waist down.
Greensburg. Ind., reports heavy dam
age to crops "and several bridees washed
away. Mrs. John Baumgardner of W abash
was struck by lightning and probably
fatally injured. Lester Bliss and Neil
Bliss were killed by lightning in their
barnyard.
Cincinnati reports a tremendous electri
cal display and heavy rainfall, with but
comparatively small loss in the city and
suburbs, outside of interrupted traffic.
CREMATED AT SAN DIEGO.
Terrible Fate of Two Slave* to the Opium
SAN DIEGO, Cal., Aug. 22. -Fire at
midnight destroyed the old lodging-house
at Second and *H streets, owned by A.
Overbaugh. The only occupants besides
two old men, who escaped, were a disso
lute woman named Nellie Bailv and her
paramour, George Fox, both of whom
were burned to death.
The old men heard the Baily woman
and Fox fighting just before the fire.
It is believed tnat Fox ended the fight
by throwing the lamp at the woman, set
ting both her and the building on fire.
They were both confirmed opium fiends.
Police Sergeant Mclnnes tried to rescue
the woman, who could be heard screaming
in a room in the second story, but was
driven back by the flames. The man
never made an outcry.
The two bodies were recovered this
morning, and it was rumored that a third
one was still in the ruins. The damage to
property was $1000.
SAUSALITO'S CARNIVAL.
Great Preparation* and Much Interest
in the Vote for Queen.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Aug. 22.â The com

being made for a great carnival. Every
body is taking an interest in it, and local
pride is aroused to the extent of seeing
that it does not become a failure. It will
be held September 26. The leading can
didates for Queen are Miss Lillian Anib
jorsou and Miss Kate Becker. Each of
these young ladies has received 130 votes.
Nine other condidates are in the contest.

AN IDEA OF THE VAST THRONG
Two Thousand Rooms Already En
gaged by Comnu'.tees and
More Are Promised.
STOCKTON, Cal., Aug. 22.â Every com
mittee connected with the Admission day
celebration is now hard at work. The
carnival committee has established a ware
house in the Yosemite Theater molding,
where the paraphernalia for the floats and
decorations has been stored. The parade
committee is busy arranging for the floats
that are to be used in the street parade.
These will be as attractive as any that
have ever been seen in California.
To-day M. McCann of the Exempt Fire
man's Association was busy arranging for
headquarters for the visiting veterans. He
will arrange to have Sutler street to the
south of Main, and between that street
and Market, covered with tarpaulin to
make a place to bouse the apparatus of the
visiting firemen.
The committee in charge of the bicycle
meet is actively engaged in securing the
best riders, both professional and ama
teur, for the occasion. At present there
are six riders in active training at the
track at Goodwater Grove. Among them
are O^cur Osen, the professional, and
Crump of Stockton. The last named will
make an effort to win the amateur cham
pionship of the State, and he stands a
very good chance of doing so.
Already the merchants of this city are
beginning to decorate their buildings, and
before many days there will be few places
along the principal thoroughfares that will
not be in gala attire. Tne decorators are
at work on the big granite courthouse,
and already hundreds of many-colored
incandescent lights have been placed in
position. Many merchants have arranged
to have their places of business lighted by
electricity in the colors adopted by the
Native Sonsâ red and white and blue and
gold.
The committee of Native Sons having in
charge the matter of securing accommoda
tions for visiting Native Sons and Daugh

working assiduously to supply the ex
traordinary demand for sleeping quarters.
In previous years it was shown that Sacra
mento and San Jose had not made ample
provision for the immense thrones of peo
ple which attended the Admission day
celebrations in those cities, and it is as
serted by persons who attended the cele
brations in both the places named that
in San Jose at least the food supply ran
short.
The Native Sons in Btockton, with these
facts in view, are using their utmost en
deavors to see that visiting Sons and
Daughters shall not only have sufficient
sieepine; apartments but enough to
eat." Restaurants, hotels, grocery-stores^
butcher-shops and other sources of food
supply have been informed of the state of
affairs and of the vast crowd of vi-sitors
which are expected* and they have been
impressed with the necessity of laying in
extra supplies.
Some idea of the crowd Stockton will
probably be called upon to accommodate
on the occasion of the 9th of September
celebration may be gathered from these
facts: There are in California about 15.
--000 Native Sons and Daughters. While
the Stockton parlors estimate that 10,000
01 these will be here, it is likely that at
least 6000 or 7000 can be counted on any
way. The population of San Joaquin
County, excluding Stockton, can be fairly
stated at about 20,000 souls, and no doubt
10,000 of them will De in Stockton on the
occasion. These figures do not include
people from all ovar the State, not Native
Sons, who will come to witness the cele
bration.
. It will be simply impossible to accom
modate all these people without extra
ordinary effort. It is figured out, how
ever, that a large number of them will
make no attempt to remain in Stockton at
night. A great number who will come up
on the steamers will doubtless avail them
selves of the boats' accommodations.
On the morning of tne 10th the San
Francisco train will leave Stockton at
about 2 o'clock. This train will also take
away a large portion of the crowd.
As fast as applications come in for
qunrters they are being provided by the
committee, and it is the intention to have
agents on the trains at San Francisco.
Lathrop and Sacramento, v?hose duty it
will be to place in the hands of all who
desire it information in regard to where
rooms can be secured. The committee
will do this without expense 4o any one,
either to ths visitors or the proprietors.
Something over 2000 rooms have been
locatod by the committee, and many more
will be located between now and tne Bth,
as a thorough canvass of the town is being
made. But with all that is being done,
the accommodations will probably fall
short unless spare rooms in private resi
dences are thrown open.
SAN RAFAEL'S HUNT CLUB
Resume* the Paper-Chat* Game for
Har*t antl Hound*.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Aug. 22.â Now that
the management of the Hotel Rafael has
chained and everything ,is running
smoothly once more, the San '. Rafael
Hunt Club has resumed ' its - "paper
chase?," . a " game for hares and , hounds,
played by society folk mounted on horses.
The course for to-day was much longer
than usual, being eleven miles, and the
start was made", an hour earlier J than pre
viously. At 2 o'clock the hares, Mias War
burton and Baron Yon Schroeder, rode off
at a slow canter, scattering pink and white
papers as they went. v The , start lacked
the fire r of the chase of ; two weeks ago.
which was led by Mrs. Crooks and Will
O'Connor.*
At 2:15 the houndsâ J. F. J. Archi
bald, Mr. Johnson, Mr. O'Connor, judge
McAllister, Mr. and Mrs. Farnsworth,
Miss Crooks, Miss Morrow, Miss Carey
and M*iss Bruce, rode off at a more lively
pace than the hares had. The traps fol
lowed in the rear. Mr. Crooks, tne um
pire, led the way to the Fairfax Villa,
which had been chosen as the finish.
The course for the hares and hounds Jay
over the Puerto Trullo hill to the Poor
Farm and then across country to Fairfax.
It was made in one and a half hours. Mr.
Archibald was the winning hound, but
came in the worse for wear. In going
through a thicket be had lost one stirrup
and had been brushed baft off his horse,
and in such a position as to be unable to
right himself until Dr. Howitt overtook
him ana set him up. However, he beat,
the other hounds and was brought home,
covered with plory, m a trap.
Miss Carey was the winner among the
ladies. Mrs. Crooks came in second, and
b >th of these riders will be presented
with handsome silver prizes. Mrs. Farns
worth rides a beautiful thoroughbred, but
as she n*Â«ared the goal the animal was eo
ing so fast that she missed the gate and
rode several hundred feet beyond.
The proprietor of the Fairlax villa
served a sumptuous luncheon to the
riders and their friends.

DANGER OF NEW
WESTMINSTER,
Bush Fires Surround the
British Columbian
City.
FEBIL ON EVERY HAND.
Nothing Can Prevent a Confla
gration Should a Wind
Spring Up.
FARMERS IN FEAR OF FLOODS.
May B; Compelled to Abandon Their
Rich Lands to the Tax
Collector.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Aug. 22.â Bush
fires are raging with unabated inry on the
mainland of British Columbia. New West
minster is surrounded, and as firemen
cannot be at all places at once it is feared
that some part of the city will be destroyed
by the on-coming flames in spite of them.
At the Burnaby City limits, at Eighth
avenue, at the Sapperton City limits and
on the Pitt River high road flames are
reaching out to the city from every part of
the compass, and should rain not come
and wind spring up in the wrong direction
nothing can save portions of the city from
being destroyed by fire.
The long-suffering farmers of the low
lands of Westminster district met yester
day in large numbers and decided to
unitedly petition both the provincial and
Federal governments to deepen and dyke
the river. The most prominent speakers
stated that this must be done or all
ranches along the valley subject to floods
would be abandoned to the Tax Collector.
As wheat grown on this land took first
prize, with all the world in competition,
at the Chicago World's Fair such a sequel
to the floods would be disastrous to the
whole province.

GERMAN IN FIVE WEEKS.
Professor Colby's W onrierful System for
Teaching Adults to Speak Oprman.
Two years ago Professor W. Irving
Colby, the noted teacher ana author, gave
a five weeks' course in German in San
Francisco, which was attended by seventy
five people, and the best of satisfaction
given. Professor Colby will commence
another course in the Y. M. C. A. Hall,
corner Mason and Ellis streets, at 4 and 8
o'clock to-morrow night. His system is
so simple and easy that he can take a
class of beginners and have them all talk
ing and reading German in half an hour.
In fact, he has done this repeatedly. He
uses his own textbook and arouses and
maintains a wonderful interest. To fully
appreciate the simplicity and rapidity of
his system one should drop in at 4 or 8
o'clock to-morrow merit and listen to the
exercises. Professor Colby is strongly in
dorsed from the Atlantic' to the Pacific,
having taught more than 10,000 people to
speak German. He positively guarantees
a speaking knowledge of German in five
weeks or no charge. Only one hour per
day and no study outside is required.
Celebrated His Honeymoon.
John Roundtree, 245 Minna street, got mar
ried Friday night and celebrated the event by
drinking too much liquor. While in a lodg
ing-house south of Market street early yester
day morning he fell down the elevator shaft, a
distance of about thirty feet, and escaped with
contusions on his shoulder, left arm and right
ankle. He was taken to the Receiving Hos
pital and later went home to his briUe.

Stockholder's Liability.
D. I. Seeley has sued A. L. Bancroft of the
Honey Lake Valley Land and Water Company
for $12,240. Bancroft is a stockholder in the
water company, owning 51 per cent of the
canital stock. Seeley holds $25,000 worth
of the bonds of the company, the security for
which, he claims, is valueless. He therefore
sues Bancroft as a stockholder for the amount
ot the indebtedness ior which he is liable.

ART LOVERS TO
HAVE A TREAT,
Rare Display of Paintings
for the Mechanics'
Fair.
WORK OF LOCAL ARTISTS
It Will Be Presented in Great
Variety in Characteristic
â¢ Groups.
HENRY KASCHEN'S METHODS.
The Enthusiastic Painter Is A'ready
Proud of the Coming
Exhibition
Judging from the present indications
the patrons of the coming Mechanics' In
stitute Exhibition will have an opportu
nity, a real artistic treat, the like of which
has not been possible at the annual fairs
for many a year. For such a collection of
pictures as are now promised will prove
an agreeable surprise for visitors to the
art gallery. Without exception the local
artists will be represented, and with some
of their best work in a variety large
enough to afford a correct estimate of
each individual painter's broadness and
versatility. Besides there will be novel-
ties in the arrangement and display which
ought to please all who are interested in
art.
The exhibition of paintings and sketches
is under the management this year of
Henry Raschen, one of the ablest of local
painters. Mr. Raschen has entered into
the work with great enthusiasm, and so
far has accomplished much that will re
dound to the success of the exhibition.
In addition to his eagerness for a high
cla?B display he entertains a sincere con
sideration for justice in the name of art, so
it may not be said of him that any prefer
ences whatever could be noticed in his ad
justment of details in connection with
hanging and selecting pictures.
"From t c standpoint of art," said he
yesterday, "pictures worthy of being ac
cepted shall be hung well. I shall not per
mit of any discrimination.
"The art gallery this year will be mainly
an exhibit of local work, all very good
stuff" â stuff in studio talk covers master
pieces as well as indifferent sketches. "I
have set the standard of art high," he con
tinued, "and shall put the good work to
gether. Eaob artist's pictures shall be
grouped, as far as it is possible to do so.
the idea being not so much to have the
wall in harmony as to have the work of
the artists well displayed. The smaller
pictures will be on the line so they can be
seen to advantage, but the larger paintings
will be well placed.
"All the local artists are coming in
with pictures in quantity as well ai
quality, and, so far, a very successful ex
hibition is assured. I have begun cata
oguinc, and the gallery throughout has
been cleaned, so that hanging of pictures
can begin Tuesday. Miss Eva With row
will have a large number of good pictures,
and among otner artists who will nave
strong exhibits are: Bloomer, Cadenasso,
Gamble, Yelland, Miss Alice Chittenden,
Briggs, Oscar Kunath, Peixotto, Jules
Pages, Keith, John. Stanton, Mathews,
Joullin, Chris Jorgenson, Hubacek, Miss
Annie Harmon, Miss Helen Hyde, Carl
Dahlgren, C. yon Perbandt, Latimer and
others. I will have some of my own
work there."
There will also be the loan exhibit ot
the late Charles and Arthur Nahl, and the
celebrated picture of Edmund Blume,
"The Confession," now owned by Mr.
Liebes, will be on exhibition. Mrs.
Tiburcio Parrott will loan some of her tine
collection.
Several designs for posters by Keller will
be shown, also the work of newspaper
artists, and the Partington School and
Mechanics' Institute classes in drawing
will be represented. Frank Currier of
Munich will have three piecesâ a head, a
landscape and a still life. Dannatt of Paris
will have a portrait on the walls. Thorn
Will be a nice exhibit of water-colors and
pastels by local artists.
Of the sculptors Rupert Schmid, Otto
Dobbertin, Frank Happersberger and F.
Flohr have promised to exhibit pieces.
It is the intention to have a drawing at
the close of the exhibition on the "Art
Union" plan, so that pictures may be dis
posed of in this advantageous manner.
THEIR STAG PARTY.
Members of the Caledonian Club Meet
in Social Session and Have au
Enjoyable Time-
The members of the Caledonian Club
met in social session Friday night in their
rooms in Scottish Hall, Larkin street. It
was a Btag party, and the previous one
was of such an enjoyable nature that last
nieht some of the oldest members of tne
club were present, and expressed them
selves as delighted with the experience.
There was a liberal supply of liquid and
solid refreshments, to which ample justice
was done. â¢
R. S. Falconer presided and kept things
moving in fine style. Among the invited
guests were: Colonel C. L. Taylor, the
Supervisor; Auditor William Broderick,
James Scrobie, Major White, Captain
Scott, J. G. Trowbridge Andrew Wilkie,
president St. Andrew's Society, andotaers.
It was an informal affair, ana toast,
song, sentiment and recitation followed in
rapid succession. Felicitous speeches
were made by Colonel Taylor, Auditor
Broderick, Andrew Wilkie, Captain Scott,
Chief D. R. McNeill, First Chieftain John
Reid, and others. Songs were sung by Y.
C. Lawson, "Scotland's Hills for Me"; A.
C. Ballingall, "The Auld Scotch Songs";
W. C. Cook, "The Miller o' Dee," and D.
H. Finnic, "The Sword of Bunker Hill."
W. C. Cook, Captain Scott and others de
livered the recitations.
The happy gathering did not break up
till "the wee sma' hours," and all ex
pressed the hope that it would not belong
before the next "stag party" was held.

lecture to-night at Golden Gate Hall before the
Theosophical Society on the "Mystical Meaning

their Masonic friends to attend, as the subject
ought to be of interest to them, hinting that
the Tneosuphisi of the esoteric branch could

growth would be possible, unhampered by
dogmatism.

LOS ANGELES' MEETING.
S. G. Hilborn Nominated for
Congress in the Third
District.
MONÂ£Y QUESTION DISCUSSED.
Delegates to Sacramento Democratic
County Convention Chosen in
Committee.
VALLEJO, Cal., Aug. 22.â Vallejo gave
the Third District Republican convention,
which nominated S. G. Hilborn for Con
gress, a rousing reception. The United
States Marine band, from Mare Island,
was in attendance throughout the session,
and Farragut Hall was profusely decorated
inside and out.
The percentage of delegates in attend
ance was something remarkable, there
being but nine proxies in the convention.
W. H. Friend of Alameda called the con
vention to order and was succeeded by R.
W. Davis, also of Alaraeda, who was made
temporary chairman, and subsequently
confirmed in that position.
Secretary Benjamin, of Vallejo presented
Mr. Davis with a gavel made of wood from
.the oaken ribs of the gallant old Hart
ford, Admiral Farraeut's flagship. The
recipient responded fittingly.
Hon. S. G. Hilborn, Judge A. L. Frick
and Hon. Reese Clark were placed in
nomination for Congressman from the
Third District, but Frick and Clark de
clined to allow their names to be voted on,
and pledged themselves to support Hil
born for the position. The latter was ac
cordingly nominated by acclamation.
Mr. Hilborn, in his speech accepting
the nomination, predicted success for the
entire Republican ticket in November.
Cheer after cheer was given at the men
tion of McKinley's name.
The convention indorsed the National
Republican platform and nominees.
Harris Speaks in Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Aug. 22.â There
was a large attendance this evening at the
First Voters' Sound Money Ulub. Mem
bers from all parts were present, Demo
crats being there in good force. The ad
dress of the evening was delivered by W.
A. Harris, a nephew of Senator Harris of
Tennessee, wno has been a Democrat for
years. Mr. Harris, however, is a most
pronounced advocate of the gold standard
and made a logical argument in favor of it
to-night.
After first declaring the adoption of the
double standard without an international
agreement to be impracticable, and a
measure which would inevitably result in
panic and possibly bankruptcy to this Na
tion, the speaker gave brief sketches of
the changeable views of Senators Jones
and Stewart on the financial question
since .1870. Both of these gentlemen had,
the speaker said, "flopped" several times
and now were on the sijverside when they
had but a comparatively short time before
been in favor of a gold standard. The
speaker compared the conditions of gold
and biiver standard countries and showed
the evil conditions which existed under
tree coinage.
The meeting of the Republican County
Central Committee "was calied to order this
rnorning by Chairman F. W. Wood.
Every portion of the county was repre
sented and all the members were unani
mous in the opinion that the County Con
vention fhouid be called as soon as possi
ble. It was agreed that caucuses should
be held September 3, primaries September
5 and the convention September 10. Ac
cording to the apportionment there will be
;;U delegates from the city and 240 from
the country. A resolution was unani
mously passed that no office-bolder or
deputy should be elected a delegate to the
convention.
Madera Campaign Opened.
MADERA, Cal., Aug. 22.â Madera
opened tbe campaign with one of the
largest and most enthusiastic meetings
ever held. Bonfires and a free use of
dynamite notified the surrounding coun
try that the people were alive to the issues
of the day. Colonel John H. Roberts of
San Francisco addressed the club and
held the attention of the members for two
hours. He claimed and proved by.refer
ence to Harrison's messsage of 1892 that
this country was at that period at the
zenith of its prosperity, and supported
the position by reference to me Senate re
port, also Feck's report of New York. He
claimed that the decline was caused by
the threat of the Democratic party to
change the tariff.
Their long delay in giving the people
tbe tariff bill paralyzed the industries of
the country and made tramps of the labor
ing classes. He showed that tbe McKin
ley bill was an equitable and just act and
reduced instead of increased tbe tariff;
that the Wilson bill discriminated against
the producers of the South and West in
favor of the North; that the Republican
party had proved itsulf the true friend of
silver by coining fifty times as much in
twenty years as the Democrats did in
eighty years, and that the fall in prices
commenced in 1893 and not in 1873. He
paid a glowing tribute to McKinley and
the Republican party. A McKinley club
was organized with a membership of 100.
San Jose Populists.
BAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 22.â The County
Central Committee of the People's party
met this afternoon, fourteen members
being present. J. R. Welch resigned as
chairman, his reason being that ne would
in all probability be a candidate for Su
perior Judge. F. B. Brown was chosen in
his stead.
The committee was enlarged by the ad
dition of Messrs. Lideyard of West Side,
Miller of Rucker, Burnett of Milpitas and
Holland of Evergreen.
It was decided to hold a county conven
tion, the convention to be composed as
follows: One delegate for each precinct,
and an additional one for each twenty
votes or major fraction thereof cast for J.
V. Webster for Governor. This will make
a convention of 164 delegates.
The question of fusion was discussed,
but notning definite was decided upon.
A Republican League Clvb t has been or
ganized at Saratoga with a membership of
twenty-five. A. L. Sage was elected presi
dent and Charles H. Hogg secretary. A
grand rally will be held at Saratoga Tues
day evening, at which Congressman Loud
will speak.
No Slate at Sacramento.
BAURAMENTO, Cal., Aug. 22.-The
Democratic County Centra! Committee
met to-day and appointed delegates to the
convention which will be held next week,
it being considered advisable not to hold
primaries. It is claimed that there is no
slate in existence, and that candidates
wiil nave to make their fiaht for norrina
tion before the convention. Yet, those
who say so smile mysteriously with the
saying. At the present time it looks like
a deadlock on fusion, as the Democrats
evidently desire everything in sight. They
are willing to concede the Populists a can
didate for the Assembly from tho coun
try, but little else.
In the Superior Judgeship there is an
out and out locking of horns, and the
Populists have come down flat-footed for
Judge McCune, while the Democrats have
three strong aspirantsâ Judges Hinckson,
Johnson and Joseph Hughes. The latter
is a young man and deservedly strong
among the adherents of the party. He
also claims a strong outside following.
Bryan Scored at Orange.
â  ORANGE, Cal., Aug. 22.â Last evening
Colonel T. V. Eddy of San Francisco ad
dressed a lar.'e open-air Republican meet
ing here. It was the first meeting of tbe
icampaign. Eddy denounced Bryan's
speech of acceptance, saying that he
thought the people should receive some
enlightenment as to how Bryan proposed
to run the Government without issuing
bonds. He said that the only platform
Bryan had was silver. Eddy denounced
the statement that silver was the money
of the constitution, as that instrument
delegated to Congress the right to issue
money, but did not define of what sub
stance it should be made.
He said that in 180H the Democratic
President, Thomas Jefferson, without an
act of Congress stopped the coinage of
silver, and in consequence it ceased to be
coined until 1834 ; that under Jackson the
ratio was raised to 16 to 1 in order to stop
the coinage of silver. Eddy said that the
"crime of '73" did not originate with
Senator Sherman. The act was written.by
George S. Boutelle. Secretary of the Treas
ury, and was adopted only after having
been debated in three sessions of Congress.
Never, declared the speaker, has a country
been able to maintain two metals at a
parity. Protection and not free coinage
is what the country needs.
Oregon Sound- Money Men.
PORTLAND, Oh., Aug. 22. â Sound
money Democrats held a State convention
to-day at Arion Hall. They organized
with the election of Judge L. L. McArthur
as temporary and then permanent chair
man and selected delegates to the Na
tional convention of September 2 at In
dianapolis. The convention was entirely
harmonious and was composed of eighty
nine members, among whom were all the
local Federal officials and a very few from
the counties outside Multnomah. Tbe
convention was more in the nature of a
mass-meeting, for no primaries to elect
delegates and no county conventions were
held. Every Democrat who renounced
Bryan and the Chicago platform was made
a delegate.
The convention was in session from 11
o'clock this morning undl late in t tie aft
ernoon before it accomplished anything.
The platform, announcing its position on
the currency question, was strongly
against free silver, declaring for it only on
an international basis. The administra
tion of President Cleveland was indorsed
with warmth and enthusiasm. Eight
delegates to the Indianapolis convention
were named and the nomination of four
Presidential electors was left In the hands
of the State Central Committee, which
was selected. It will name electors after
the nomination of candidates at Indian
apolis.
Tardy San Jose Democrats.
SAN JOSE, Cal., Aug. 22.â A meeting
of Democrats who believed that the pres
ent County Central Committee of their
party has been dilatory in entering upon
the work in the campaign, met this even
ing at Murphy's Hall. Tbe gathering
numbered about 100, including a liberal
sprinkling of Populists. A permanent
organization was effected and named
the Democratic County Central Club,
the officers of which are: Leo Archer,
president; T. W. Carroll, vice-president ;
j. E. O'Connor, secretary, and A. Phillips,
treasurer. A resolution was adopt ed call
ing on the County Committee to arrange
immediately for open primaries to elect
delegates to a County convention.
The meeting passed a resolution de
nouncing the action of the last Demo
cratic Convention in condemning the pol
icy of Governor Budd. A resolution bit
terly denouncing Joseph P. Kelly, Demo
cratic candidate for Congress, was pre
pared, but was killed in tbe meeting of tbe
committee on organization.
The Democratic County Central Com
mittee met during the afternoon and ap
pointed a committee of three to confer
with the Populists in regard to a fusion on
the legislative and county tickets. A com
mittee was also appointed to arrange for a
primary election for a delegate to the
county convention. A call was issued for
a meeting next evening to form a cam
paign club.

going to Thompson Falls, was also killed.
Fireman D. 0. Fr!zell of Hope, Idaho,
was almost instantly killed. His mother
and sister reside in Spokane. Head Brake
man J. W. Bolger, whose parents are in
Michigan, was buried under the wreck and
his body was found during the day.
Men who know this point of the road
well say it is a bed of quicksand where
the filling was made where the old trestle
once stood. They reason that a part of
the embankment settled or sank under the
weleht of the engine and spread the track,
causing the accident.

balance of the jurors were secured this

cused of murdering Jack Littiefield, of
Attorneys for the Defense of Jo Gregory, on Trial at "Weaverville,
Cal., for the Murder of Jack Littiefield Near Round Valley.
which the following i 3 the completed list:

William Gribble and 0. E. L. White.
Recess was then taken till 1:30 o'clock,
Judge Jones cautioning the jurors to re
port any attempt to tamper with them to
the court.
Deputy Attorney-General C. N. Post in
his opening speech boldly accused George
Jo Gregory, Accused of the Mur
der of Jack Littiefield on Sep
tember 27, f 895, Near Round
Valley.
E. White, the Mendocino cattle king, of
aiding and encouraging tbe conspirators
at whose hands Jack Littleiield came to
bis death. His statement was as follows:
Now, if the court please, and gentlemen of
the jury, J will at this time outline in behalf
ot the prosecution tne facts that we hope to
prove to you, upon which we will ask a ver
dict of conviction in this case. The crime
with which defendant is charged is mali
ciously killing one A. D. Llttlefield on the 27th
day of September, 1895. We will establish to
your satisfaction that at that time, or at least
on that date, at about tbe hour of a quarter
before 6 o'clock, or in that neighborhood, pos
sibly earlier, he was shot tnree times, and,
alter being shot to death, a rope was placed
around his neck, his body dragged some dis
tance, the rope thrown over the limb of a tree,
his body elevated from the ground, the rope
tied and his body left hanging.
The facts preceding the killing, the imme
diate facts, as we will prove to you, were that
one Baylis W. Van Horn, Constable of Long
Ridge Township, aided by one John Crow,
whom he had ju9t deputized as a deputy
constable, proceeded to a spot on the west
bank of the north fork of Eel River, near
where Hulls Creek emptied into that stream,
and placed Jack Littlefleld utider arrest for
the alleged shooting of one John M. Vinton;
that the officers disarmed him and told him
they were going to take him to Weaverville-
They started toward Weaverville, taking what
is known as the Wylackie and Red Mountain
trail, crossing Eel River, proceeding: on over
Wylackie Hill past the McPherson place, on
toward Red Mountain, and when arriving at
a spot two miles and a quarter south of the
Red Mountain House the crime was perpe
tratea.
We will show to your satisfaction, gentle
men of the jury, that this crime was the re
sult of a consDiracy which had been in process
of incubation for several months, arising pri
marily out of the animosity entertained by
one George E. White, a resident of Mendo
cino County, toward pne Sylvester Palmer;
that the deceased, Jack Littiefield, was an in
timate friend and employe of Palmer and as
such cams under the ban of Mr. White's dis
pleasure; that Mr. White himself did not per
sonally participate in the matter, but by en
couragement fiiyl employment engaged in the
transaction through the services of the de
fendant, Joseph Gregory, Bayies W. Van Horn.
John Crow, John M. Vinton, Fred Radcliffs
and Dryden Lacock, better known as "Buck"
Lacock.
We will show to yon that the defendant,
Joseph Gregory, Dryden Lacock, John M. Vin
ton, Thomas Hayden and John Crow had dis
cussed the matter and the advisability of
hanging Littiefield, and Palmer also, a num
ber of times previous to the commission of the
offence charged; that Vinton and the defend
ant, Gregory, endeavored to induce others be
sides these named to enter into the conspiracy ;
that John M. Vinton, acting as an employe of
White, had quarters at what is known as the
Vinton caDin, near the Willburn crossing of
Eel River, about two miles from Thomas
Hayden's residence, and that he was
out there in charge of White's cattle and
sheep; that Hayden resided, as I said
before, about two miles from that point,
and that Vinton was at that place, the
Vinton cabin for some days prior to the com
mission of the offense; that on the ot
September Vinton claims to have beeu shot,
and I believe was shot, while ridins among
the hills; that on that evening, a couple o.
hours after having been shot, he made his way
to the house of Thomas Hayden and remained
there for some weeks thereafter; that John
Crow and Thomas Havden on the 2t>th or -2bth
of September, 1895, returned from an excur
sion they had made to Mad River and that
they found Vinton at the Haydon House
wounded; that Vinton, without informing
Crow who had shot him, directed him to go
that night and procure the services of Baylis
Van Horn; that Crow did go to the home of
the Van Horns, some eleven or twelve miles
from there, that night, and on the next morn
ing Van Horn and Crow started from the Van
Horn home and arrived back at Haydou s
bouse about 1 o'clock on the afternoon of the
25 th.
Judge Post then proceeded to describe
in detail the movements of the various
accused parties up to the time they met at
Hayden's house. He said:
We shall show that ibis defendant, Gregory,
and Radcliffe arrived at the Vinton cabin,
Lacock accompanying them back, at a very
early hour in the morning: that they entered
the house and had a talk with Vinton and re
mained there all that forenoon, doing nothing
until about 1 o'clock, when Crow and Van
Horn arrived; that they had dinner, and that
about 2:30 or 2:45 Buck Lacock, Tom Hay
don, the defendant (Joe Gregory), Fred Rad
cl:ffe, Baylis Van Horn, John Crow and Gor
don Van Horn all left Hayden's house, armed
with rifles, some having, in addi'-ion to rifles,
their pistols, Van Horn and Crow going for the
purpose of arresting Littiefield upon the charge
of having shot Viuton and the other five for
the purpose of ascertaining tracks made at the
alleged spot where Vintou claimed to have
been shot.
We will prove in addition to that that this
defendant Gregory has on numerous occasions
threatened the life of the deceased; that he
has invited and endeavored to entice various
persons to enter with him into a conspiracy to
kill Littlefieid; that on the 14th day of De
cember, 1894, he cut Littlefieid with a knile
and wounded him to badly that he came very
near dying; that at the time that Liltlefleld
was killed he was under bonds to be tried at
Ukiah tor the crime of cutting Littiefield.
Now, these general facts that 1 have outlined
to you in connection with other corroborating
facts, gentlemen of the jury, we claim will be
of such a clear and convincing nature that up
on these facts we will ask from you a verdict
of guilty.
The tirst witness to take the stand was
Henry Ingram, a surveyor, who has been
engaged in surveying the scene of the
murder, and who brought to court a
chart showing the trails, distances, etc.
A motion was made by the prosecution to
offer the chart in evidence, but owing to
the number and length of questions pro
pounded by Oregon Sanders, which
threatened to consume the balance of the
afternoon, Mr. Post withdrew thn motion.
The next witness upon the stand was
James Willburn, a halfbreed, who was
with Littletield at ihe time of his arrest.
He stated that he had last seen Littletield
alive about 3 p. it on September 27 on the
lower end of Long Ridge, near Eel River.
Himself, in comoauy with Jack Little
field and Johnnie Watben, a stepson of
Yes Palmer, went to Wylackie.' John
had been herding cattle thatdny, ana had
lain down to rest half an hour before Crow
and Van Horn rode up ordering Littiefield
to surrender. Johnnie Walthen, the boy,
rode up. He was circling the cattle at the'
time and overheard the conversation.
About fifteen minutes after Littlefieid bad
been taken into cuÃtody a secoud party
rode up, consisting of James A. Box,
Annie Crabtree, Rose Russ and A. Will
burn. They were driving beef cattle and
united their stock with those in the hands
of Willburn and the boy, and together
they rode on for a mile and rounded up
the cattle on a hill just across Hulls
Creek about sundown, where the whole
party camped.
It was endeavored by the defense to
break down the witness* testimony that
was given in the Crow and Van Horn case,
but in i his they did not succeed. The
essential point in the testimony was to
learn the exact time of Littlefield's arrest,
for upon this the result of the whole trial
hinges. It was also tried to prove by ttie
defense that the horse Littlefieid had se
lected to ride when compelled to join the
officers was weak and slow. But the wit
ness steadily maintained that "it was a

good little mare, pretty fast when she was
in good fix, but a little run down, but still
the best horse in the wrangle."
Witness was still on tne Btand when
court took a recess till Monday morning.

LAST NIGHT IN

Grotesquely Humorous En
tertainment at the
Jinks,
BURIAL OF THE BOTTLE.
A Live Property of the Funeral
Parade Refused to Quit
Acting.
SOLDIERS' CONDUCT PRAISED.
Los Gatos Citizens Have Only Words
of Commendation for the
Guardsman.
Camp City Guard, )
Co. B, First Reg. Infantry, N. G. C.,V
Los Gatos, Cal., Aug. 22. )
This, the last night of Camp City Guard,
was celebrated by a high jinks, to which
many ladies were invited. As a grotesque
and humorous entertainment, it beat any
thing that the hospitable people of Los
Gatos had seen in a long time. A large
crowd of spectators gathered around the
campfire. There were so many that it was
impossible to find seats for all the ladies,
and many sat on the hillside and looked
down on the scene.
The first specially was a cavalcade of
grotesquely-dressed guardsmen. It was
supposed to be a funeral procession on its
way to the grave. The thine to be in
terred was a bottle, the favorite bottle of
the camp "pound," which had at last died
from exhaustion and overwork.
Sergeant Townseud, attired in a silk hat
and a clown's costume, led the way astride
a donkey that had been borrowed for tbe
occasion. 'Then came a fife and a muffled
drum playing a mournful march, followed
by k squad of men with trailing arms.
Behind them the long-necked glass corpse
was borne high on a brass salver, and then
came other guardsmen in grotesque attire.
The rear of the procession was brought up
by Privates Sieberst and Osthoff in a bur
lesque costume of Svengali and Trilby.
The cavalcade marched around the
camptire amid shrieks of laughter. Even
the donkey seemed to catch the spirit of
the moment, for he lifted up his voice and
brayed so loudly that the echoes in the
hilis were awakened. A grave was dug
with pick and shovel and the bottle was
interred amid much weeping, wailing and
laughter.
Dr. Sieberst delivered a very touching
funeral oration over the tenement ot the
"spirit" that had fled. Ssrgeant Taylor
was master of ceremonies and he prodded
witn a bayonet the man who refused to
weep. After one of these jabs there was
not a man in the cavalcade who refused
to get down on his knees on the cold earth
and shed bitter tears. The singing of a
hymn closed the funeral services at the
grave, and the procession moved slowly
away amid applause. The long-eared don
key was so overcome by the spectacle, or
made so sleepy by the warm glow of the
fire, that he could not move. A special
detail pushed hini from the ring of light
into darkness.
The remainder of the programme con
sisted of songs and recitations by mem
bers of the company who previously en
tertained the campfire on similar occa
sions. To-night Mrs. S. S. Austin, wife
of the proprietor of El Mor.te H >tel, had
the dining-room cleared and furnished the
music for the closing ball of tbe en
campment.
Major C. E. Jensen, brigade inspector,
who has been here two days, said: "I
am glad to find that the people o;' Los
Gatos are impressed with the gentlemanly
conduct of the members of tlie company.
They at first hesitated over having the
encampment here, I understand, but Com
pany B has dispelled all fears of disor
derly conduct that they have had. For
merly members of the National Guard
seemed to think that the moment they
got into a uniform they had special license
and special privileges, bnt I am glad to
say that the feeling has changed, and that
the troops feel they have the Rood name of
the State to uphold."
To-night Major Jansen challenged the
sentinels, and attempted to run the guard
to test its efficiency. He was satisfied
with the vigilance of the sentries, not
withstanding that it was tbe last night in
camp.
Major-General N. T. James and staff â
comprising the following officers: Colonel
John Gallwey, surgeon; Lieutenant-
Colonel Thomas M. Cluff, inspector of
rifle practice; Lieutenant-Colonel G. R.
Burdick, Quartermaster-Major P. S. Pott,
Aid-de-Camp Colonel William McDon
ald â arrived this afternoon. The follow
ing officers of the First Infantry arrived
on the same train : Lieutenant-Colonel V.
D. Duboce, Major Charles Boxton, Cap
tain A. J. Kelleher; Lieutenant-Colonel L.
Barrere, inspector of rifle practice; Lieu
tenant M. Hecht. paymaster; Lieutenant
Maccreagli, Captain Connelly, Lieutenant
Brown, Lieutenant Huber, Lieutenant
Tobin, Captain SutliSe and ex-Lieutenant
Guisti.
To-morrow after luncheon Company U
will break camp and return to San Fran
cisco on the afternoon trains. No guard
will be left behind, as the camp will be
packed up ready for shipment. While the
members of the company have enjoyed
themselves ail week and profited by the
encampment, the majority of them are
ready to return to the City and to work.

ASTORIA, Ob., Ang. 22.â J. Weston
Daggett, the aeronaut, met with an acci
dent this evening which will in â  all proba
bility bring his parachute ju'mDingTito.a
close. An ascension and parachute jump
was advertised for 5 o'clock, but the usual
delay occurred, and it was 7 o'clock before
everything was in readiness. A large
crowd had assembled from whom he made
a small collection. He was dissatisfied,;
and remarked, "There is not enongh to :
pay funeral expenses, but I'm going up i
anyway." The balloon was then cut
loose and ascended about 2000 feet. When
the parachute; was disconnected some of
the ropes were seen to have been broken,
and the aeronaut came down 'with a suc
cession of rocket-like flights, striking on a
hill south of the residence portion of
town. His collar-bone is broken, one of
bis legs is thought to have been driven up
into the hip, and internal injuries are
feared. The exact nature of the injuries
cannot yet be stated. -

A Modern Climax in the
New Play, "A Social
Trust."
REPLETE WITHINCIDENT
A Drama to Be Produced for the
First Time Next Mon
day.
AT THE COLUMBIA THEATER.
Californians in New York, as Seen by
Ramsay Morris and Hillary
Bell.
A degree of interest beyond the ordinary
has been awakened iv dramatic circles by
the expected production of a new play at
the Columbia Theater next Monday eveu
ing. The new drama is called "The Social
Trust." It is the work of Ramsay Morris
and Hillary Bel! ot New York. Through
the kindness of Mr. Frawley a reading of
the original version has been permitted.
If the reader's judgment counts for any
thing, the playgoer expecting a drama re
plete with vigorous action will not be dis
appointed. In a sense it may be called a
New York society play, but the authors
would hardly claim tnat the best society
is represented. The speech of the dia
loeue is not faultless.
The characters are: Frederick Brewster, |
Daniel Hallock, Charteris King, Captain j
Beresford Wynne, Pnilip Cornell, Ed
mund Brewster, Lilian Cornell, Mrs. j
Bleecker Nelson, Mrs. Russell" Cornell, ,
Mrs. William Morton, Mrs. Daniel Hal
lock and Dora Sprague. The first act is
laid in Mrs. Cornell's New York home
after dinner. Borne of the people are in
the louneing-room and others on the bal- !
cony. The talk and situations reveal the
nature of the drama. Daniel Hallock is
in evidence. He is the head and front of a
Cordage Trust and with the reputation of
success cuts a wide swath.
His rise from obscure poyertv to
affluent notoriety is vaguely outlined. In
a Denver hotel he was "dead broke, 7 ' and
there his brilliant brain conceived the i
scheme of forming the trust. In Chicago j
he borrowed money from a Califoinian to !
get to New York, an idea which has al
most any merit but originality. Anyhow,
Hallock! to use his own phrase, "got
there."
Mrs. William Morton is another figure.
She enters the New York swim with
boundless wealth, required in California.
Her niece is Lillian Cornell, her nephew
Fb.il Cornell, the son and daughter of
Mrs. Russell Cornell. Lilian Cornell is in
love with Charteris King, a promising
author. Phil Cornell is in love with Wall
street. The aunt, Mrs. Morion, is a very
determined sort of a person, with some of
the inflexible characters ascribed to the
Puritans, without moral sense a3 ballast.
She has firmly resolved that Lillian
shall marry Frederick Brewster, a repre
sentative of one of the oldest and best
families of New York, whose sister has
married the Earl of Orsilly. Mrs. Cornell,
the mother of Lillian, is subdued by Mrs.
Morton. Lillian is told during the evening
that a proposal for her hand has been re
ceived. In her simple, maidenish delight
she supposes that Charteris King has
spoken, but her vision of happiness is j
utterly defaced when she is apprised that i
Frederick Brewster is the suitor. She is
inclined to be rebellious. She stands on
her rights and dignity for a time, but when
the secret has been rudely imparted to her
that her father left nothing which was not
trimmed with a mortgage and that her
dear mother, her beloved brother and her
self are maintained in food, clothing and
social prestige by her aunt, Mrs. Morton,
she relaxes a little. At first she talked of
giving up everything, of enduring poverty
and even of going back to California rather
than sell herself, but when she thought of
her mother and brother exposed to
poverty and distress she exclaimed:
"Then my marriage to Mr. Brewster
would avert all this?" He? aunt some
what graciously replies:
"Within twenty-four hours after you
have accepted Mr. Brewster I will make
a settlement on your mother which will
render her independent for life, give you a
quarter of a niiiLon dollars and purchase
lor Phil an interest in a Wall-street firm."
There is somewhat ot a scene here, but
Lillian, exclaiming "I am to be sold," ac
cepts her destiny.
It seems that Frederick Brewster, who
is presented as an example of the New
York aristocracy, wants money to put in
Daniel Hallock's Cordage Trust. He has
roped in all of bis acquaintances and club
chums, but more money is needed. There
isn't a great deal to be said about Mrs.
Hallock ' beyond classing her as a bird.
Hallock met her first in a Pullman car go
ing out of Chicago, introduced himself at
Fort Wayne, dined with her at Pittsburgh,
proposed at Harrisburg and married her
in Jersey City. It is well understood by
everybody but Hallock that she is the at
traction which brought Brewster into the
Cordage Trust and induced him to get his
friends to invest.
Eight months having elapsed since
Lillian sold herself the next act is Mrs.
Frederick Brewster's reception. In this
act Phil make* love to Dora Sprague of
Boston. There is quite an interchange of
witticisms of tie current type, about the
relative culture of Boston and New York.
Some of it waj original when it was pub
lished in the newspapers. King leav
ing a cross in love gained a crown
in literature. He attended Mrs. Brew
ster's reception on an invitation from
Mr. Brewster. His old sweetheart,
Lillian, didn't know he was in town,
but Brewster saw him in the club or on
the avenue the day after the steamer
arrived from Liverpool. Brewster being
hard up for money to float the paper trust
and gladden Mrs. Hallock was inspired by
the notion that he could raise money if he
could bring hit wife and her old-time
lover into a compromising position, so he
sent the card inviting King.
This was not a pretty thing fora scion
ot one of the best New York families to
do but Brewster needed money. The
trap was baited for King. In his ardor
he lost his judgment and was becoming
impetuous in his love-making, while
Brewster watched him through a balcony
window. A kindly spirit in the shape of
Mrs. Nelson intervened to save the young
wife. She broke up the love scene by sub
stituting Captain Wynne for the lover and
putting herself in Mrs. Brewster's cloak,
which hart fallen on the sofa. Brewster
came in to spring the trap and found Mrs.
Nelson and Captain Wynne there. The
work here is clever. Wynne Is dum
founded at the ardor of Mrs. Nelson, but
the love-making begun to save Lillian ends
ir. the marriage of the captain aim Mrs.
Nelson.
About this time in the progress of
events the Hallocks have resolved to take
their proper place in New York society.
Mrs. Hallock* has been abroad for the
necessary polish, and so her advent into
society is to be celebrated by a grand ball.
The word is given out that the "400" must
be there.
She has demanded that Brewster shall j
bring his wife. At the reception Brewster
tells Lillian that she must go to the ball.
Since her marriage she has bad made
known to her the relations which exist be
tween her husband and Mrs. Hallock.
There is a strong dramatic scene in this
act. Lillian declines to attend the ball,
and he becomes brutally obstinate in de
manding thÂ«tf she shall go.
He says: "You are mine. I bought
you and paid for you. You are mine; do
you hear? You sold yourself in the hope,
I suppose, that when my name had given
j'ou a social position \ ou could whistle
your lover back and have him trotting at
your heels, and yet you considered yonr
self better than Mrs. Hallock."
Ten days later Mrs. Daniel Hallock's
ball took place. The Cordaee Trust was in
great distress. Tue sum of $300,000 had to
be raised by 10 o'clock the next day, or
disclosures would be made which would
send Brewster and Hallock to State's
prison. Hallock was desperate. Brewster
was nervous. Lillian went to the opera so
as to go to the ball as late as possible.
The "400 " were there, including King,
the successful author, who had written a
famous book. Lillian came in late and a
scene took piece when she was introduced
to Jirs. Hallock. The scene calculated to
delight the aristocracy may not be lost on
the dames of Washerwoman's Bay. Mrs.
Hallock said something about the kind
ness of Mrs. Brewster in accepting the in
vitation. Mrs. B. protested that she
had not received an invitation. The fenc
ing was carried on until Mrs. 8.,
with a vicious thrust, said a com
munication from the hostess had been re
ceived, in which her husband had been
commanded to introduce his wife.
A great uproar followed. Demonstra
tions of violence were made and some of
the "400" were shocked. Everything went
wrong at the ball. Hallock went to the
Windsor Hotel !o promise the directors of
the paper trust that Brewster would pro
duce the $300,000 at 10 o'clock the next
day. Mrs. Haliock learned from Brewster
how desperate the situation was. St.c pro
posed that Brewster should sail the next
day in the Majestic, and promised to con
vert hsr diamonds, valued at $50,000, into
cash and follow him on tne next steamer.
Halleck had meanwhile resolved that
Mrs. Morton should come down with
the money to save the. Brewster family
from the disgrace of prison stripes.
Phil Cornell was at the ball. He was
there just in time to protect bis sister from
the brutality of her husband. They left
shortly after the scene witn Mrs. Hallock.
Mrs. Nelson went along, and the famous
author, Cbarteris King, got into a carriage
some way and went with tne party to the
Frederick Brewster mansion.
The fourth act occurs at the Brewster
residence about midnight or 1 o'clock.
Nobody is .particularly happy or sleepy.
Brewster is in a fearful frenzy of distress.
HailocK is violently agitated, but Mrs.
Morton, the firm old soul, is inflexible.
As Brewster left Mrs. Hallock's house she
slipped a note in his pocket. It contained
endearing phrases and likewise a proposi
tion to bolt for Europe. Here a deeply in
teresting scene occurs. It is not original
by any means, but nevertheless it is pe
culiarly fascinating.
Brewster gets home, enters a room,
reads the note from Mrs. Hallock, folds It
up. places it on a table by which he is
standing, then he takes a revolver from
bis pocket and meditates. His meditation
is interrupted by the arrival of Hallock,
who takes the pistol from his partner and
tells him to brace up. They talk of send
ing for Mrs. Morton and telling her that
she must put up the money to save the
Brewsters from shame and disgrace.
Hallock fancies that his wife must have
passed through the room. An illusion of
that character impresses him. He Rets a
slight scent of her perfumery. Uncon
sciously he takes the note which lay on
the table and toys with it. The nervous
apprehension of Brewster becomes alarm
ing. Meanwhile Mrs. Morton has been
summoned.
Brewster thinks he has fathomed the
secret of the love-making interview be
tween his wife and King, which was inter
rupted by Mrs. Nelson. He threatens
that divorce proceedings will follow and
Lillian's name be brought into court un
less she <Mrs. Morton) relieves the finan
cial distress. She declines to put up a
dollar to save anything or anybody.
As a last card Mrs. Cornell and Mrs.
Nelson are called. Mrs. Nelson does not
reveal what Brew3ter expected. Hallock
is still folding and unfolding the note.
Brewster is on the verge of despair.
Finally the culminating scene comes.
Hallock reads the note; reads it again;
turns pale and purple. The truth begins
|to flash on his mind. He perceives the
I treachery of Brewster. He denounces
him, attacks him. Brewster pleads for his
life, fleeing from the room.
The scene gathers in force. Lillian cornea
to the room. King, the author, comes
aiso. In the next room the voice of Brew
ster is heard pleading for his life. The
angry and outraged Hallock relents not
Lillian does not open ths door. When im
plored to do so she exclaims, "I wait lor
the judgment of God." Snarp on these
words comes the pistol shot and Lillian,
fainting, falls into the arms of Charteris
King, the successful author. The curtain
falls. It is presumed that Mr. Brewster,
the representative of the New York aris
tocracy, expired.
REPAVE FOURTH STREET.
Residents ani Business Men Will
Demand a Better Place
to Walk.
Caustic References to the Supervisors
and Kind Words for the
City Press.
Friday night's meeting of the Fourth
street Improvement Club, held in the ban
quet hall of the Pioneer building, was
largely attended and marked with every
indication of determination and interest.
J. T. Sullivan, president of the club, occu
pied the chair. Mr. Nolan of the commit
tee appointed to wait on the Board of Su
pervisors reported that his companions
and himself had applied to the Finance
Committee of the board and been put off
by reason of the circumlocution employed
by the City Fathers and ttieir attaches.
Mr. Swift made a brief but spirited ad
dress, suggested by Mr. >o an's discour
aging report. He said the Fourtn-street
property-owners would have to demand
justic tirom the Supervisors in season and
out of inion uniil justice should be done.
j He was also in favor of asking the City
press to aid the movement by keeping it
before the public.
Dr. Mayhew also recommended per
sistency in demanding the restoration of
Fourth street to a condition at least less
intolerable than its present state. The re
lief required was, lie continued, imme
diate, since the street as now obstructed
was % menace to the public and disgrace
to the City.
Dr. Maybew's remarks so pleased the
gathering that his name wa3 added to the
committee specially deputed to keep the
Supervisors in mind of the state of af
fairs.
The dust, the mud, the eccentric tips
and downs and scattered paving-stoves
which at present distinguish Fourth
street from the other City thoroughfares
were dwelt upon at length by several
other speaker*, all of whom urged imme
ate and energetic action in the matter at
issue. Twenty-five new members were
admitted, and the enthusiasm and har
mony of the assembly was peculiarly
noticeable.
Letters were read from J. D. Pheian,
Henry E. Highton and A. S. Cornwall, in
which the objects of the club were cor
dially indorsed and commended. Resolu
tions were adopted in favor of a deter

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1896.
SHERLOCK ADMITS
HE WAS CARELESS
Does Not Know Why He
Gave Malaber the
Key.
STRICT RULE VIOLATED.
No Right to Permit a Patient
. to Enter the Medicine-
Room.
MURPHY BREATHES HIS LAST.
The Half- Blind Malaber Keeps Sher
lock Company in the City
Prison.
Richard Sherlock, nurse in ward B of
the City and County Hospital, whose care
lessness Friday is believed to have been
the cause of the death of one patient and
â¢ The Nurse and the Man "Who Administered the Poison.
the probable death of another, is detained
in the City Prison pending the inquest of
the Coroner. With him is the partially
blind George Malaber, the patient who
administered the dose of cocculns indicus,
believing it to be black draught. Both
men were taken from the Seventeenth
street station at an early hour yesterday
morning and conveyed to the City Prison.
Yesterday afternoon both seemed in a
half-stupefied condition, and neither de
sired to place the blame any further than
themselves.
"I have been sick with la grippe for
two weeks," said Sherlock, "and yester
day obtained permission to take an after
noon off. I went out on the Ingleside
car 3 and walked about at the end of the
line in the sunshine. I came back to
town, got something to eat, and returned
to the hospital about 10 o'clock in the
evening. The janitor met me in the hall
and told me I was under arrest. I was
completely dumfounded.
"My ward is a convalescent ward. The
patient? there need but very little attend
ance. Netcher and Murphy, though, were
to have an operation performed to-day,
and I was instructed to give them each
two ounces of the black draught between
half-past 2 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
When I left the hospital I gave the key of
the medicine closet to Malaber and direct
ed him to give the dose at the proper
time. I showed him where the bottle was
on the shelf and left.
Malaber has frequently taken the bottle
to the druggist to get it refilled with the
physic and was familiar with its shape.
"The bottle of cocculus indicus I had
not had occasion to use for nearly a month.
Then it was used as a germicide and was
rubbed externally on the body.
"I was positive that this bottle, which Is
about the same size as that containing the
black draught, was at the rear of the shell
behind all the other bottles.
"The only theory I can advance is that
one of the physicians must have bad occa
sion to use the poison And had returned it
to the shelf, placing it in front of the
black draught.
"When Mallaber went to the closet he
put his hand on the poison bottle thinking
it the bottle of physic. 1 '
Mr. Malaber's eyesight is so affected that
he can barely make out the large head
lines of a newspaper. He cannot distin
guish objects farther than two or three
feet away.
"I remembered how the bottle looked
and the size of it," said he. "I put my
hand on a bottle that was in the place
where 1 expected to find the black
draught. I poured it out and it was black
like the physic.
"About an hour after I had given the
patients the draught Netcher went into an
epileptic ht. 1 called a doctor and he told
me I had given the wrong medicine."
The bodies of Netcher and Murphy lie
at the Morgue.
Richard Sherlock is a- man abont 50 years
old. He was born in Ireland and has been
a nurse for about twenty-eight years. He
acted in the capacity of nurse in an insane
asylum in New YorK, under Dr. John fi.
Gray, for twenty years. He came to the
City and County Hospital in 1888 and has
been considered a trustworthy and effi
cient nurse there during his eight years'
service. He is a widower, as is also "Mala
ber. Sherlock has no family, but Malaber
has ft little girl ten years old in England.
Malaber has been a patient at the hospital
for thirteen months, being treated for
atrophia of the optic nerve. He is a car
penter by profession.
Dr. Dudley said: "It is a very unfor
tunate thing, indeed. Sherlock directly
violated the rules of the hospital in giving
the key of the medicine-closet to a patient.
He should nave notified Nurse O'Connor
ol ward A, immediately below his own,
ward B. Sherlock was a good nurse and
has always been trustworthy. Ha had
sole chnrge of the "eye ward " and also
attended to mild surgical cases. I do not
know what punishment may be meted out
to him by the law.
"We all feel sorry for him, but it was a
terrible piece of carelessness. He has al
ready been discharged by Dr. Stable and
a new nurse has been put in his place.
Malaber could not be expected to know
about the bottles in the closet. Tiiey are
not kept there in alphabetical order be
cause only experienced men are allowed
to take medicine from the closet.
"Sherlock was a sober man. In fact I
never knew that he drank at all."
"We shall have to be at the elbow of
every nurse," said Dr. Stable yesterday.
"I am afraid we shall not be able to trust
any one to administer medicine."
Murphy died at 10 o'clock last night in
the City and County Hospital.
MISSION BURGLARIES.
Back Dnors Forced Open and Houses
Robbed in the Afternoon.
The police think they have in custody
the burglar who has been operating for
some time in the Mission district. Yester
day Officer E. J. Thompson arrested a
suspicious character and booked him at
the Seventeenth-street station for vag
rancy pending an investigation that may
result in a more serious charge being
placed against his name. The man is "an
old-timer." having been arrested two
years ago by Sergeant Pernn for "tapping
a till" and for stealing a horse and buggy.
He was recently released from the House
of Correction. All his life he has lived in
the Mission and is familiar with the
neighborhood.
Last Thursday at noon as the woman
who lives over a grocery-store, corner of
Eighteenth and Howard streets, was pre
paring dinner she was startled by a roueh
lookinÃ man who suddenly appeaced in
an adjoining room. She quickly turned
him out. That man is the one arrested
yesterday, the woman having immediately
identified him soon after his incarceration.
The residence of P. Holland, 228 Capp
street, within a blocfc of thi3 same grocery
and of the Seventeenth-street station, was
entered by a burglar the same Thursday
afternoon "and a>x>ut $200 worth of jewelry
and silverware takeu in the absence of
Mrs. Holland.
A similar burglary, also committed in
the afternoon, occurred on January 14,
when the residence of Mr. Myers, 2032
Howard street, just around the corner
from the Seventeenth-street station, was
entered and over $250 wortn of jewelry
stolen.
CADETS GO INTO CAMP,
Six Companies of the League
of the Cross at Glen
Ellen.
They Wi 1 Live Like Soldiers in the
Field for a Weekâ Military
Masses.
The League of the Cross Cadets, with
the exception of companies A and I, which
already had their summer outing, left
town yesterday afternoon for Glen Ellen,
where they went into camp for a week.
The cadets fell into line on Van Ness
avenue, near Market street, and marched,
with flags flying and drams rattling, to
the ferry depot of the San Francisco and
North Pacific BÂ«ilway. Captain Filgate
was in command. Companies B, C, D, E,
G, H and L, under command of Captains
James Curiey, Edward Fitzgerald, James
McÃride, Dauiel McCarthy, Edward
Power, James Powers and William Clark
respectively.
They left on the evening train and ar
rived in camp in the dusk o! evening and
at once adjusted themselves to the strict
military discipline which will bo theirs
for a week to come.
Their camp has been named after the
Rev. Philip O'Ryan, spiritual director of
the league. Rev. James McDonald of
St. Peter's Church will be chaplain and
Dr. A. P. Mulligan the camp surgeon.
The cadets will have a taste of military
routine until next Sunday morning. Even
friends cannot be seen by the cadets until
10 o'clock in the mornings.
The daily routine, however, will be
varied pleasantly with athletic sports,
guard mounts, dress parade and reviews,
and visits of friends from San Francisco.
On the arrival of the 7:30 a. m. train
from the City this morning a grand mili
tary mass will be celebrated in the large
pavilion on the grounds.
The following Sunday similar services
will be held, and they give promise of be
ing very impressive ceremonies. On the
latter occasion, however, the cadets' choir,
which has been organized and instructed
by Professor Sandy, will sing the musical
accompaniment. Father McDonald will
officiate at both masses.
The military exercises will begin every
morning with drill from 6:30 to 7:30
o'clock. Inspection will follow at 9, and
from that hour until 5 the boys will be free
to amuse themselves according to their
own inclination. At 5 o'clock there will
be a guard mount and dress parade, and
then the boys will be free until tattoo. A
grand ball has been arranged for Saturday
night.
This encampment is the principal one of
the league this year. Two companies had
their outing, but the main body of cadet?
are united on a grand gathering at Glen
Ellen. Special rates have been made by
the Donahue Railway Company for ex
cursions during the encampment, so it is
expected that the families and friends of
the boys /Will visit the camp in large
numbers.
Failed to Appear.
Hugh O'Nell, the San Ma too County butcher
who was convicted by Justice Kerrigan on Fri
day for selling diseased meat, failed to appear
In court yesterday to receive his sentence. The
Judge ordered a bench warrant Issued for
O'NeJl's arrest, but later received a note from
him tnat his horse had run away on Friday
and threw him and he was unable to appear
in court. The ca%e was continued.

BUTCHERS' HOURS
TO BE RESTRICTED
The Board of Health Will
Correct Certain
Abuses.
MR. DAVIS' SUGGESTIONS
Insurance Men Object to the Use
of Coal Oil on Condemned
Meat.
RISKS LARGELY INCREASED.
The Market Inspector Will Recom
mead That Hearts Be Hung
Twelve Hours.
Market Inspector Ben Davis finished a
task that was assigned to him by the
Board of Health some time ago and yes
terday made known the result of his
labors to Health Officer Lovelace.
It became known to the board that in
spite of the most strenuous efforts on the
part of Davis and his assistants diseased
beef was being slaughtered in Butcher
town and it was reasonably certain that
this meat was finding its way into the City
to be sold for human consumption. Dur
ing the daylight when the inspectors
could be on hand the practice could not
be carried on, but after nightfall, when
the health employes had gone home tired
out, the diseased cattle could be driven
into the slaughter-houses, killed, and
the carcasses removed before the return of
the inspectors in the morning. Davis was
asked to devise some means to obviate
this.
Then the board has been appealed to by
the butchers and the companies with
whom they insure their places to find
some other means of preventing the use
of meat after condemnation than by pour
ing coal oil over it.
The insurance men are drawing the line
at slaughter-houses where such measures
are adopted because of the increased risk,
and the butchers feel the matter keenly
because of this, and because, in a great
many cases, the odors arising from the
large amount of kerosene used contami
nate other meats hung in the buildings.
This matter was also ulaced iv Davis'
hands. >
To prevent the clandestine slaughtering
of diseased animals Davis will recommend
that the hours during which the Killing
can done be limited from 7 A. M. to 5 p. m.
The objectionable coal oil will be done
away with by having a stamp, designed
to be used with indelible ink, purchased
for the use of the inspectors. With this
every portion of the diseased carcasses
will be marked, so that it will be a matter
of impossibility for cuts to be usea with

It is not believed that reputable butchers
will object to these regulations in the
least, and it is thought the Board of Su
pervisors will readily grant the request of
the Board of Health that the hours of
slaughtering be arranged as mentioned.
Davis will also make a recommendation
regarding the use or carrying into the
City of meat immediately after slaughter
ing. It has been the practice, particu
larly of the Chinese, to take beef hearts
and livers to their quarter even before they
have become cola. It is a well-known fact
that fresn meat, particularly shortly after
slaughtering, has a tendency to attract
particles flying in the air, and it is believed
that disease germs are often introduced
j into the system in this manner.
The Market Inspector's Idea is that
butchers should be compelled to hang
such meats in their slaughter - houses
twelve hours before they are allowed to be
taken away.
These matters will be brought up before
a meeting of the board at an early date.

As heretofore, the Southern Pacific will
meet these rates at once, and will have
their revised schedules to these points
ready for issuing by Tuesday.
Since the Valley road issued its first
class rate schedules, the Southern Pacific
has adopted an entirely new basis of rates
for first, second, third* and fourth class
freight between San Francisco and Stock
ton. Its old rates between these points
were 6 cents for 100 pounds on first-class,
| 3 cents for 100 pounds on second-class and
[ 2 cents per ]00 pounds on third and fourth
class freights, and these were the rates
used as a basis by the Valley road in its
first tariff-sheets. In its efforts to meet,
the rates of the Valley road, Huntington's
line cut the first-class rate to 5 cents, but
advanced the second-class rates to 5 cents
and the third and fourth class rates to 4
cents per 100 pounds. Mr. Moss ha* now
met the reduction on first-class rates, but
maintains the old rates between San Fran
cisco and Stockton on second, third and
fourth class shipments. Thus the Valley
road rates from San Francisco to all
points to and beyond Stockton are 2 cents
per 100 pounds, or 40 cents per ton lower
than those ol its competitor. The Valley
road's reduced first-class rates are now as
follows, excluding the points already
given in one of the foregoing tables:
San Francisco to San Francisco to
Burnham 12 Gracey 34
::s.Â»ou ltf Merced. 36
Clauston 17 Turner 38
Empire 20 Geneva 40
Hugbson 22 Le Grand 40
Elm wood 27
In order to ascertain the rates from San
Francisco to the points about to be opened
it is only necessary to add to the rates
from Stockton, given in the first table, 9
cents per 100 pounds for first class, 3 cents
for second class, 2 cents for third and
fourth class and 60 cents per ton for the
remaining six classes of freight.
As most of the freight moved into the
valley falls m the second, third and fourth
classes, the difference of 40 csnts a ton in
the Valley road's rates on these classes
will give that line a great advantage in
securing freight.
Grain rates will also be announced on
Monday between the new stations and San
Francisco, Port Costa and Stockton.
Up to now the Southern Pacific has been
quoting fifth class and class A rates only
by the ton in carload lots, but it will
shortly make these rates apply to less than
carload lots, and will quote them per 100
pounds, and will thus adopt the present
style of the Valley road's schedules.
Directors Watt and Payson and Chief
Engineer Storey of the Valley road re
turned from an inspection of the line yes
terday. They made the trip from Stock
ton to Fresno in about four hours, stop
ping at the four big bridges to thoroughly
examine them. They were found to be
satisfactory in every particular. Some
portions of the road were passed over at
the rate of fifty miles an hour, and a
large portion of it was covered at a forty
mile gait.
Engineer Storey when asked what the
prospects were of entering Fresno, replied
that they were good, and that all dilficul-

BARNS BURSTING
IN SIN BENITO,
Assessor D. F. McPhail's
Story of the Enor
mous Yield. â¢
A HEAVY BEET CROP.
The Money Made Will Cause
Many Others to Go Into
the Business.
THE TEIUMPH OF SEVEN DANES
A New Furnace Is Being Built for
Quicksilver Treatment at
N-w Idria.
D. P. McPhail of Hollister, Assessor of
San Benito County, is in the City, after
making an extensive canvass of the vari
ous property interests in San Benito.
He says there are enormous yields of all
kinds of crops there.
"The average and quality are excellent,"
he said. "San Benito in regard to her
products is having a phenomenal year.
There is a large crop of hay and an enor
mous crop of beets. There are in all about
2500 acres of beets, which will be mar
keted at the beet-sugar factory at Watson
ville. The yield has been so good that it
is probable at least 10,000 acres of beets
will be planted next year.
"The average yield of beets will be
about twelve tons an acre on a conserva
tive estimate, but there are many farms
that will go twenty tons. The beets brine
$4 a ton delivered at Watsonville, while
the freight on them by rail is 50 cents,
leaving $3 50 net.
"It is estimated that the expenses of
thinning and cultivating the beets is but
$5 an acre. That, in fact, is the regular
contract price there. So you see there is a
very handsome profit in the business.
"As an instance of what is being done,
seven Danes, brothers, rented a farm of
279 acres, paying for it $7 an Â»ere as the
rent. They have raised not less than eigh
teen and probably twenty, tons to the
acre. Three of the Danes have done nearly
all ihe work, the others being engaged in
a nther beet-raising enterprise near Wat
sonviUe. It is said that on the first farm
the three will make $6000 this year above
all expenses.
"The hay crop of San Fenito will
amount to about 9000 tons. It is a little
short of the crop of last year, because of
the increase of the acreage of wheat. The
wheat wiil average about fourteen centals
to the acre.
"There is a tremendous crop of barley.
It wih average about twenty centals, but a
eood deaJ of it will go as high as twenty
seven or twenty-eight centals.

soon. Already the mines are being exten

there.
"About seventy men are being employed
now, but a much larger lorce is to be put
on. These valuable mines are in the ex
treme southeastern part of San Benito
County.
"The future of San Benito County is
very bright. This has been a remarkably
good year. The only thing we can
complain of, is the low price for other
farm products. If they should rise it
would be an exceedingly prosperous era
there.' '

VIOLATION OF CONTRACTS
Open Letter From the Building
Trades Council on School
Work.
Union Painters Also Purpose to Ex
pose Fraud in Their Line of
Business.
At the meeting of the Building Trades
Council last night L. F. Danforth was
elected treasurer and J. G. Phenix vice
president.
A resolution was adopted denouncing
the police for arresting American citizens
while in the enjoyment of their rights of
free speech on the side streets.
The business agent reported that he had
inspected the bulkhead which" Contractor
Jobn McKay is putting: up at the tfernal
Heights . School ana found that the
material used is not according to specifica
tions, as mortar is being used instead of
cement and sand. He submitted samples
of the material of which he complained.
This brought up again the council's
complaint against the Hoard of Education
and the contractors who are and have
been whitening and repairing the school
; houses. The debate resulted in the issu
| ance of the following card:
We, the Building Trades Council, sanctioned
the committee appointed by the Painters'
Union, to investigate the work being done on
the schoolhouses two weeks ago, and in
structed them to give a written report to the I
Board of School Directors. The committee of !
; painters dirt so. and the board referred it to its
j committee that has had charge of the work
I from the beginning.
We know that committee did not attend to
its duty before, for it allewed the work to
progress in a shameful manner, knowing that
ihe schools had to be opened in one week from
the time the contracts were let, and that if lt
allowed the work to be completed in the man
ner that it was, so that it would be too late co
condemn it afterward. Even now some of the
schools are not ready tor occupancy, which is
a shame and a disgrace to the City of San Fran
cisco.
It seems strange to us that the board did not
let the work when the school-buildings were
I first vacated, and not wait until the last week,
I when they knew that it was impossible to have
I them compieied in time for opening. Even
I the janitors could not do the necessary clean-
I Ing, which they generally do during vacation,
I for they had to wait until the calcimining
was done. We denounce the way the work
has been done, from a mechanical and sani
tary standpointâ sanitary, for the reason that
the walls and ceilings have not been cleaned,
as they should have been, and as the specifi
cations call for.
Another thing that seems strange to us is
that one man should get so many contracts on
different school buildings, for work entirely
out of his tine, and should be allowed to do
I the work In so shameful a manner. Therefore
I we denounce the persons in charge of said
I work for allowing it to progress in tbis dis
| graceful manner, and we ask the public and

The delegates from the Painters' Union
presented the following report:
The Painters' Union at last session adopted
a means of exposing the fraud which Is beinsf
perpetrated in their trade, with the object of
fcenefitinsr property-owners, legitimate master
painters and themselves. The matter will be
exposed through the means of circulars ex
plaining every detail of the schemes through
which the property-owner Is defrauded. The
instrument to be circulated gives the details
of fraud very explicitly. The object is to bring
to the attention of the public the fact that
they are being deceived in a good many cases
when they are having painting done.
HIS LIBERTY FORFEITED.
Thomas Hutchingon Was Left Behind
by the Steamer Manowai.
Thomas Hutchinson, the pardoned
criminal, who was to leave the country on
the steamer Monawai which sailed Thurs
day evening for Australia, succeeded in
failing to keep his promise and he may
have to serve out his term of imprison
ment in San Quentin.
Hutchinson was accused of the crime of
robbery in this City three years ago and
sent to the State Prison.
At the earnest request of his family in
Australia, and upon a statement made by
a dying women, that she was the guilty
party, Q-overnor Budd was induced to par
don him on condition that he would leave
the country for New Zealand on the first
steamer bound for that port.
It was discovered on Friday mornins;
that Hutchinson was still in town. He

tin.THE SHADOW
OF SHADOWS.
A Face in Marble Entitled
" Degeneration," by
Dobbertin.
FLASH OF INSPIKATION.
Is Greater in Its Way Even
Than His "Kiss of
Death."
THE FINGEK-TOUCH OF VICE.
Sin's Ravages Portrayed With Singu
lar Accuracy and Wonderful
Vividness.
There are countless bright and beautiful
creations in the studio of the sculptor,
Otto Dobbertin â creations in marble of
such fairy elegance and delicate graceful
ness that they seem frozen out of some
delightful dream; creations full of light,
as though Dobbertin had crystallized the
sunbeams that pour down all day long
through the skylight into his workroom
and had fashioned them into semblances of
human life. There are lights there and
then there are shadows depicted, so deep
they give infinite pleasure even to the rich
fancy of William Keith, whose studio is
just across the hall, and whose fancy and
studio are both so filled with wonderfully
dramatic contrasts in light and shade.
The hign light in the studio of Dobber
tin is his story of love in fine curved mar
ble hgures, but the shadow of shadows is
in a single face â a mask. A face in which
so much of the mysteries of life bordering
on the hideous are portrayed that sensi
tive visitors involuntarily turn to the fig
ures telling the story of love.
This face flashed across the imagination
of Dobbertin in a single moment of inspir
ation, and so impressed his memory that
he made it immortal in marble. He has
called it "Degeneration." It is the face ol
a young woman once beautiful, but now
distorted and seared with the finger- marts
of vice.
Tbe features of the right side of the face
are drawn, the eye glares in an expression
less sort of way, the nostril is expanded
and the mouth is half open. The left side
is sunken in and paralyzed and there
are flowers on the woman's matted
hair, showing a deluded effort to redeem
some of Her lost attractiveness.
"The idea was in my mind," said Dob
bertin, "of a beautiful physical organiza
tion gone completely to ruin, leavine noth
ing but horror in place of its former love
liness.
"You see the face appeals neeatively to
the mind. It is an index of the destruc
tive forces of human nature. The spark
ol goodness in woman or the craving for
beauty has prompted her to place flowers
on her hair. But tne result is only to
make her own ugliness the more apparent.
"The artist must produce tbe full gamut
of degeneration at one stroKe. To my
mind the whole thought is here. I saw it.
i did npt design it."

Young; f< Jim" Brophy Scores the Ban
ner Week at the Grand and Re
ceives a Remembrance.
It remained for a Ban Francisco boy to
force the management of the Grand Opera
house to hang out tbe "standing-room
only" sign every night for a weet. For
nearly two years Manager Morosco has
presented a different play each week. They
hare been more or less successful. Lttt
week was the banner week of the
house's experience, and it was brought
about by James M. Brophy in "The En
&ign."
Yesterday, in order that Mr. Brophy
shoaid realize that his efforts were appre
ciated, Mr. Morosco presented the young
ster with a cane, made after Mr. Morosco's
directions, that has not its duplicate.
Twined about the upper half of the cane
is a pennant, an "ensign" of gold and sil
ver folly twenty inches long. The body
of this flag extends along the handle of
the cane and is set in solid gold. In it
are set thirteen large diamonds, the num
ber of original (States.
The rest of the pennant is silver. On it
is engraved :
Compliments of Walter Morosco, Grand
Opera-house, to James M. Brophy, '-The En
sign." Banner week, August 23, 1896. San
Francisco.
This is in one long line and extends the
length of the flag. At the end of the stick
is a golden bear two inches long, symbol
ical of Mr. Brophy's being a Native Son.
Mr. Brophy concludes his engagement
on Sunday night. He starts at once for
New York, and on Monday week opens a

FEASLESSNESS OF IGNORANCE.
Conduct of a Tourist Who Insisted
Upon Going Into a Crater.
Captain Basil Hall tells one oi those sto
ries which are always coming up to prove
tbat the man who knows nothing about a
danger is the one to fear it least and io
neglect a salutary obedience toward those
who have trodden a path before. The in.
cident was narrated by an old guide at Ve
suvius- ,
"A few years ago, said calvatore, "I
came up the mountain with a party of
gentlemen, one of whom insisted on going
not only around the cone, as we are doing
now, but actually into the crater, though
I told him that such an adventure was at
tended with more danger than the thing
was worth.
â¢ l 'Pooh ! Pooh ! Danger?' said the pig
headed gentleman. 'What do I care for
danger? Am I not a soldier? Why, man,
I have faced the foe beiore now ! Lead
the way, I'll follow.'
"I merely said that to face a human
enemy and to face an active volcano were
two very different things.
" 'Are you afraid to go?' he asked.
" 'I don't much admire it,' I answered,
'but as I think I know how to evade the
danger when it comesâ having bpen at th 3
work fornearly half a centuryâ l'll go into
the crater if you are determined upon the
adventure. Only I warn you again, the
danger to an ine'xperienctd person is very
ereat.'
"'Weil! Well!' he called impatiently.
'Come alonn!' And away we went, he
flourishing his stick like A sword, while I
only shrugged my Bhouiders.
" "Now, sir,' I said to him, 'the only plan
by which we can hope to accomplish this
expedition in safety is to be perfectly
steady, and if a shower of stones comes
about our ears to stand as cool and col
lected as if nothing were happening. I
hope we may not have any while we are
in this awkward place, but if we should be
so unfortunate, mind, your only chance is
to stand fast and look forward. It re
quires good nerves, so brace them up.'
" 'Oh. nerves!' said he, skeptically. 'Is
that all? You shall see. 1
"So away we went, climbed the lip of
the cup, descended into the fearful abyss,
and though half-choked with the fumes,
saw all we wished to see. We were on our
return when the mountain roared like
thunder, the ground shook, a furious
eruption took place and myriads of stones
were shot a thousand feet into the air.
" 'Now, signor, mio,' I called, 'stand
your ground and make good use of your
nerves. Look ! Be steady, and you may
escape.'
"But the man who had facea mortal
foes quailed before the powers of nature.
He looked up. as he was bidden, but w'lien
he saw a cataract of fire falling on his
bead, the courage of which he had boasted
forsook him, and incontinently he fled.
"For my part, I was too much afraid to
fly. I never saw such a shower of stones,
and I wonder we were not both de
molished. As it was, my companion had
not run far before he was struck down by
these missiles.
"One of them broke his leg and another
stunned him, and I had enough to do to
him out of the cone on my shoulders.
Much work we had to take him into
Naples, where the hotel-keepers and the
Italian doctors between them had the
plucking of this precious pigeon for the
next six taonths."â Youth's Companion.

A NOVEL SMOKING-ROOM.
Unique Electric Pen Decorations on
Gould's Yacht, Atlanta.
George J. Gould, who is commodore of
the Atlantic Yacbt Club, has recently bad
a number of alterations made to the
interior of his magnificent steam yacht
Atlanta, vfhicb, as everyone knows, is one
of the most luxuriously equipped yacnts
on this side of the Atlantic. When the
Atalanta was originally built, some thir
teen years ago, for Jay Gould, the father
of the present owner, yacht-men came
from far and near to examine the wonder
ful carvings in her dining saloon, which is
the most magnificent apartment of its
kind on any yacht.
On the Atalanta, as is the custom on
many English yachts, the owner's quar
ters are forward instead of aft, a; is usu
ally the case, and tbe principal apartment
on the main deck is a large ladies' saloon,
which leads hy a stairway aft to the din
ing saloon below. This year Mr. Gould
had about ten feet taken off the after end
of the ladies' saloon, which he has con
verted into a smoking-room and buffet, j
where he can drink a cocktail and smoke
a friendly cigar without being disturbed.
This room, though hardly noticeable on
account of its size, being only about ten
feet square, is chiefly remarkable for its
unique decorations and the inscriptions !
on its wells, which instantly attract the j
attention of the most blase yachtsmen ou I
account of their beauty and originality.
The room which Mr. Gould calls his i
"den" is beautifully paneled in white ash,
surrounded by led leather-covered sofas.
While this is not very remarkable in itself
the decorations are, for burned into the
wood for about a tenth of an inch by the
aid of an electric pen are screll-work fig
ures running along the wall, sides, and
even in the beams supporting the ceiling.
The contrast between the smoky character
of the decorations and the white ash back
ground is remarkably beautiful and nas !
attracted the attention of every visitor on
the Atalanta since the room has been
opened; In case any visitor should forget
his real reason for entering the room in
his admiration for the decorations Com
modore Gould lias kindly burned into the
wall the following inscription :
II on my theme 1 right Ir think, there are five rea
sons why we ilnnk:
Good wine, tt friend, because I'm dry, or lest
I should be by and by, or any other reason why.
â â We woii't count this one."
While on the other side of the room are
the following lines:
Would'nt thou know tbe secrets of the sea?
Only chose who brave its dangers
Comprehend Us mysteries.
This is about the first work of its kind
ever done by the eiectric pen, and judging
by the result on the Atlanta it has opened
a new held for the decoration of natural
wood. â .New York Sun.
MATHEMATICS AND LOVE.
Demonstrating the Relations Between
the Two.
"I wish," said the young man, as the
twilight deepened, "I could believe you
loved me as niuch as I love you."
"That," said the collene maiden, "is sim
plicity itself. Suppose I demonstrate it to
you mathematically."
"Well," he responded, somewhat doubt
ully.
"You and I," continued Miss Axiom
"belong to a certain circle, do we not?"
"Yes," he assented.
"Consequently," said she, "we mieht
call ourselves radii of that circle."
The young man nodded.
'The two radii of a circle are equal to a
third radius of the same circle."
He did not contradict her.
"It is established beyond all possible
dispute that things which are equal to
the name thing are equal to one another."
The young iran was interested, but puz
zled.
"Now," she concluded, in triumph, "if
you and I are both equal to an unknown
quantity, which we will call X â "
"What is X?" he interrupted.
"Our love for each other," was the

FLATTERING TESTIMONY.
Interesting Interview With the
Well-Known Specialist, Dr.
F. L. Sweany.
A physician's life is one of constant
study and self-denial of many of the
pleasures and recreations of life, provided
he feels a desire to achieve a high degree
of success and to occupy a pre-eminent
position in his profession. To better un-
derstand and appreciate how a successful
physician must be thoroughly devoted to
his patients and to their treatment the
following interview had yesterday with
the well-known specialist, Dr. F. L.
Sweany of 737 Market street, will afford
interesting leading.
The doctor 'was found in his office busily
engaged with a throng of patients, and
after some hesitation decided to grant a few
minutes' interview upon the subject of nis
immense and highly successful practice.
Dr. Sweany is a man of fine appearance
and possesses a frank open face that at
once inspires confidence on the part of his
patientÃ. When asked what his special-
ties are as a physician, he replied:
"I treat blood and skin diseases, female
complaints, stricture, liver, lung, stomach
and Heart diseases, piles, ruptures, hydro-
cele, varicocele and kindred troubles, and
most of all give attention to tbat baneful
ailment so common to mankind in this
country, viz., nervous debility, or as it is
often called, lost manhood.
"I am," he continued, "a graduate of
several of the foremost medical colleges of
this country, and in addition have had an
extensive experience in the hospitals of
this country. I find that with all this ex-
perience and all this schooling it is possi-
ble by constant study to improve upon
many of the old-time methods for curing
diseases and for the relief of suffering
humanity.
"There are. I know, many physicians
who are content to continue in the old rut
and to follow, year in and year out, the
same old rule for treating different kinds
of sicknesses that they learned when first
attending medical schools. With me my
profession is of such all-absorbine Interest
and I am so devoted to it and so anxious
to disco vefr the best methods of treatment
that I am willinp to and do constantly
make explorations in the fields of science
and medicine on my own account. As a
result of these repented and continuous
investigations and experiments I feel that
when I undertake the treatment of a
patient lam going to cure him ; and from
no other source or from no otner physician
can my remedies and methods of treat-
ment be obtained.
"I have, as a matter of course, had
many complicated cases come under my
care durinar my long practice, but I can
truly say that I have invariably cured all
whom I have treated, where my instruc-
tions and treatment have been followed
out. There are, to be sure, some cases
that are incurable, and when a patient
applies to me who is afflicted with an in-
curable disease I frankly tell him, as any
honorable physician should, that he is
beyond all hope. But in the line of dis-
eases to which I give special attention I
have never yet found a case, no matter
how stubborn, that would not yield to my
treatment."
When asked in regard to tbe extent of
, his practice Doctor Sweaney said that
while this City'and Coast was a field of a
Ereat portion of his practice, yet it was
not by any means limited by the bound-
aiiesofthe United States, and here the
| doctor showed letters from patients resiri-
j ing in Germany, Italy, London, England
and even in South Africa. Continuing the i
doctor said : "I am daily in receipt oi any
quantity of letters ordering medicines and
applying for treatment, but the most
precious missives that come to me in my
i mail are those which testify to my cures
| and which come trom patients who tender
; to me their sincere and heartfelt tbanks
I for saying ihem from lives of suffering and
I despair. Leading the way to his corre-
spondence-room the doctor took up from a
hu^e stack of letters a number that con-
tained testimonials of a most flattering
character and of which any physician
mitrht well feel very proud.
He said that it was his invariable rule
never to divulge the names of bis patients
or iheir diseases, yet he made an excep-
tion in the case of the writer merely to
convince him of the genuiness of his
i cures.
The following are a few extracts copied
verbatim .from the original letters, and
they tell their own eloquent story of Dr.
Sweany's skill and ability as a specialist:
F. L. SWEANY, M. D.
City.
F. L. Sweany, M. D.â Dear Sir: Think-
ing lhat perhaps a few words from one of
your grateful patients might be the means
of encouraging others to try your treat-
ment I write these lin^s to inform you
tbat since stopping your treatment, some
few weeks ago, I have had no return of my
old troubles, and am now quite ?ure that a
perfect and uermanent cure has been ef-
fected in my case. When I began your
treatment I was sadly in need of medical
aid and 1 cannot be too thankful that I
found the risiht place to go. Yon guaran-
teed to cure roe. and while I at first
doubted very much whether I could be
benefited, it "is with pleasure that I can
now say that your truarantee has been
made good, and I only hope that this fact
will be as much source of tatisfaction to
you as it is to me. J. D.
Dunsmtjie, Cal.
F. L. Sweany, M.D.â My Dear Doctor:
I have not felt as well in twenty years as
now. My stomach is in pood condition.
I sleep well; my apDetite is good; in fact
lam hungry all the time. The color is
coming back in my face. I can say your
medicine is a great boon to me. I have
taken medicine of our doctor here, but all
the relief I had was temporary only.
Wishing you success in all yonr under-
takings is my humble prayer. Yours re-
spectfully, A. A.
Maktintown, Wis.
Dr. F. L. Sweaxyâ Dear Sir: I came to
the conclusion that I was a well man and
would not need any more medicines. I
tiiank you very kindly for what you have
done for me. Yonrs respectfully, J. S.
Db. F. L. Sweasyâ Dear Sir: I am feel-
NEW TO-DAT.
ing splendid, although I am working very
bard running a harvester. If I had not
been under your treatment I would not
have been able to work at all. Yours
truly, G. L. A.
Martinez, Cal.
Mr. F. L. Sweany â Dear Doctor: So
overwhelmed am I with surprise and joy
with the success your treatment had on
me that I hardly know how to begin this
letter. I have followed your directions as
carefully as any one could and my medi-
cine is almost gone, so I would like to
have you tafce the next step in my treat-
ment. Beginning only a few weeks ago
with hardly any faith in such a little
.medicine, but takiner it more as an experi-
ment, I am more tkan surprised.
A. E. P.
lowa Hill, July.
Dr. F. L. Sweanyâ Dear Sir: Thanks to
God and to you, I am about all right. 1
thinfc that" about two more bottles of
medicines to take inwardly will cure me
all right. I feel as well and strong as can
be. If I should want any more medicine
after the two bottles 1 will let you know.
I am very thankful to you for lhegood
you have done for me. " R. M.
Marysville, Cal.
Dr. F. L. Sweanyâ Daar S;r: My Bupply
of medicine is about exhausted. I feel
that I am gaining daiiy. My general
health is better than it has been for sev-
eral years. If my improvement continues
I shall certainly not regret the amount it
has cost me for your very valuable ser-
vices. Yours very truly, J. C. P.
Reno, Nev.
Dear Doctorâ l thank you from the bot-
tom of my heart for the kindness dou ars
doing me. You are tne only doctor that
has ever done me any good. Before 1 sent
to you I had five other doctors to wait on
me, and none of them helped me. -B. B.
P. 8. It is quite a surprise to the people
here to see me up, for the doctors here all
thought I was going to die. They are sur-
prised to think that there is a doctor that
can cure me.
Duksmuir, Cal.
Dr. Sweany â Dear Sir: I am feeling bel-
ter every day, and I don't want to get out
of medicine. I sleep good and my appe-
tite is good. My nerves are more steady.
I think I will come out on top yet. I
would have been well long ago if I bad
commenced treating with you at the start.
I would have been under the sod if I had
not taken your medicine. I weigh 195
pounds, which is 29 pounds more than I
weighed when I commenced taking your
medicine. Yours respectfully, A. A.
Fort Wingate, N. Mex.
Mb. F. L. Sweaxy â Dear Sir: .Enclosed
please find $100. Send me another supply
of medicine. I am getting; better every
day. I hope I will be cured in a very
short time. J. B.
The doctor at this point begged to be
excused, saying that be had already taken
up more of his patients' time than he baa
intended. Thanking the doctor for the
courtesies accorded during the interview
the reporter withdrew, convinced that the
doctor's record was all that he claimed it
to be and that his cures were genuine, aa
the many testimonials shown proved.

OF THE SEASON.
' ; McMAHAN ESTATE
. COLONY TRACT
In Northern Solano County Is being subdivided
and parceled out in small â  holdings -to - actual '
settlers at reasonable prices and on most favor-
able terms. **. No land In the world is richer than
that in the valley of - Putah ; Creek. Among the
splendid bodies of land undergoing partition none
can surpass in fertility of soil and beauty of loca-
tion the McMahan rancho, adjacent to the town of
Winters. W , : '. . :
This rancho was formerly a part of the old Wolf-
skill grant, known far and wide as among the very
beat tracts or land in California. Putah Creek
flows through the McMahan tract, and every foot
of the 4000 acres now being subdivided will pro- !
duce anything from cabbages and onions to or- \
anges, lemons and potneeranates. The location
: Is but 75 miles from San Francisco, and is in tbe !
midst of as beautiful a country as one could wish I
to see. Hundreds of the finest, orchards in Cali-
fornia dot the s'opes In every direction, ana the
church and school bell can everywhere be heard.
In short, it is an Ideal region for the Intelligent,
Industrious, well-to-do home-seeker, and be can
here find, at a cost of $67 50 per acre, land which,
located In some other sections of the State not a
whit more attractive, could not be bought for $201)
per acre. Two thousand acres sold since January

a letter about the Nicaragua canal, calling
attention to the anomalous position of
this country in regard to the canal and
expressing an opinion as to the reason for
the position taken.
The benefits of the canal are pointed out
and the assistance of the candidate, in
case of his election, in making the canal a
certainty, is asked. The following is a
copy of the letter sent to McKinley. A
similar one is to be sent to Bryan:
The Chamber of Commerce of Sani
Francisco, >
San Francisco, August 20, 1896. J
To Hon. William McKinley, Canton, Ohio â Sia :
The necessity for the prompt construction of
the Nicaragua canal under the control of the
United States Government is recognized by the
people of the Pacific Coast, irrespective of
party. Without it our future progress must
be hampered by rates of transportation neces
sarily so high that little or nothing is left for
ou' producers.
Since and including the Garfield campaign
both polittcal parties have promised us this
beneficent work, but campaign promises have
produced no results, and our country to-day
occupies the anomalous attitude among the
nations of an obstructionist, declining to act,
and pronounced against control of the Nic
aragua canal by any foreign power. The im
portance of the canal to the prosperity, pres
tige and military safety of the Republic has
been urged by all prominent American states
men. It has been the subject of discussion
by Congress for many years, and the canal
route has been surveyed by several Govern
ment commissious.
Our present purpose is to ask you on behalf
of our patiently expectant people if, in case you
are elected to the chief magistracy of the Re
public, you will aid with your great influence
the prompt construction of the Nicaragua
canal under the control of the United States
Government, with such conservative pro
visions as will secure its use to our commerce
at low rates of toll and without discrimination ?
There are honest differences of opinion about
other subjects under discussion during the
present political contest, but on the Pacific
Coast, certainly, and, so far as we can learn,
in every part of our country, there is
unanimity of opinion on the question of an
American interoceanic canal.
Our people demand its prompt construction
as "an American canal under American con
trol," and your views ou this great question
will be anxiously awaited by all patriotic
citizens, especially by your countrymen on the
Pacific Coast.
With assurances of high esteem, we sub
scribe ourselves,
Your fellow-citizens,
Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco,
Hugh Craig, President,
John L. Howard, First Vice-President.
SAN LUIS CELEBRATES,
Annual Jubilee in Honor of the
Patron Saint of the
Parish.
Seven Priests Participate in High
Mass at the 0 d Mission-
Historical Sketch.
SAN LUIS OBIBPO, Gal., Aug. 22.â The
annual celebration of Saint Luis, the
Bishop, patron of the parish, took place
here Wednesday. The old mission was
filled to the doors with a congregation
composed largely ot Catholics, although
other denominations were represented.
There was a solemn high maÂ«a, and to add
to the impressiveness of the scene seven
priests were at the altar, as follows: Cel
brant, Rev. Fatlier M. Corneally of this
city; deacon, Rev. Father Closa of San
Juan ; sub-deacon, Rev. Father Lynch of
Arroyo Grande; first master of cere
monies, Rev. Father Lack of Santa
Ynez; second master of ceremonies. Rev.
Father Aguilera of this city. Rev. Father
O'Reilly of San Miguel also iarticipated
in the ceremonies.
Rev. Father MoNamee of Santa Cruz
delivered a very interesting sermon on the
life of the saint of Tolosa, after whom the
mission here was named.
The history of Saint Luis is an interest
ing one and would fill many pages. He
was the son of the King of Sicily, living
during the twelfth century, ana owing to
a war with France, was Danished to exile
in Barcelona, Si>ain, along with his two
brothers, for the deeds of their father, the
I King. While in exiie Luis, who was but a
i boy, became acquainted with some Fran
ciscan monks, nnd aiter patient study, be
came at the age of 21 a Franciscan himself
and a strong illowerof the Catholic creed.
At the age of 22 he was ordained as a
Bishop of Tolosa, France. At the age of
25 death claimed him. He was the young
est Bishop known in Catiiolic history.
Hence are the outlines of the patron saint
after whom the mission in this city named
"San Luis ObisDO de Tolosa," and whence
ihis city derives its name also. The build
ing in which the religious fe nival was
held to-day was built in 1772, and on the
Ist of September following Father Juni
pero Serra, assisted by Rev. Father Jos
eph Caballer, blessed and put in its place
the holy cross; and the first mass was
sung amid a vast number of Indians
who had assembled for that purpose!
This was also the inauguration of this
city as well; hence the celebration to-day
brings forth historical facts of many years
ago.
THE DAWN IS DANGER
She Was Caught in a Storm Jfear Cata
iina Isl.-md.
AVALON, Catalina Island, Aug. 22.â
I The steam yacht Dawn had a hairbreadth
| escape yesterday when she encountered a
terrific gale at sea between the island and
the mainland. The little craft had started
od a cruise to San Diego with a party of
gentlemen on board, and was some ten or.
twelve miles out when the gale strnck her
and tossed the frail craft like an eggshell.
The engine became disabled, and the help
less boat was at the mercy of the waves
which rolled literally mountain high.
After severe struggles she was
brought safely into the harbor at
Avalon Bay at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
The members of the party were: Drs.
Hazlet and Davidson, Messrs. Johnson and
R. T. Blow of San Bernardino; Dr. David
son, Messrs. Jeffries and H. M. Corlett of
Los Angeles.
TULARE TRIEVES CAPTURED.
Two Young Men Come to Grief While
Robbing Stores.
TULARE, Cal., Aug. 22.â F. P. Sharp
and James Norton were cleverly captured
to-day by Officers Carlisle and Tompkins
while in the act of stealing a suit of
clothes from J. Goldman & Co. Sharp
and Norton carried with them a peculiarly
constructed light box. The box was
shipped from Selma last night by express.
They got the box to-day from the Wells-
Fargo agent, walked directly into Gold
man's store, and while Norton dickered
for a pair of shoes Short lifted a suit of
clothes into the box. Goldman, being
suspicious, shadowed them when they left
the store and notified the officers. The
two crossed the block to Sheftel's store,
where they bought a shirt. The officers
knocked the box from under Sharp's arm
when a suit dropped out. They were
caught and taken before Justice Gist,
where Sharp pleaded guilty and will re
ceive his sentence in the morning- Nor
ton pleaded not guilty and his trial waa
set for Monday next.
FLORA FINALISON'S F UNERAL
Impressive Services Over the Remain* of
Nevada's Songstress.
RENO, Nev., Aug. 22.â The remains of
the late Flora Finlayson were laid to rest
in Odd Fellows' Cemetery yesterday after
noon. The Congregational Church, where
the funeral services were held, was pro
fusely decorated and the casket was buried
under floral offerings. The building was
packed to its utmost capacity and many
people were unable to gain admittance.
Key. T. Magill officiated and the services
were most impressive. His prayer and
touching references to the deceased
brought tears to the eyes of nearly the en
tire congregation. A choir consisting of
Miss May Bourne, Mabel Stanaway, Ber
nice Worland, George McNees, E. \V.
Jamison and J. Gregory sang appropriate
hymns. The remains were followed from
the church to the cemetery by a long Una
of carriages.
WRALING IN MUNTERET DAY
Major Behaufele to Extmd the Scope of
Bis Operations.
MONTEREY, Cal., Aug. 21â The MonÂ«
terey Whaling Company is once mora
actively at work. Major Schaufole is in
can Francisco purchasing more boats and
tackle and also securing some experienced
harpooners. Whales are so numerous in
Monterey Bay now that one crew is not
sufficient to make whaling profitable here.
Captain Pedro, commander of the present
crew, says that with only two boats and
ten men whaling is dangerous. Although
his crew had harpooned three whales in
the last week, yet they were compelled to
cut line for need of more modern appli
ances.

Three Youthful Salvors Have
Gone to San Leandro to
Seek Revenge.
TOWED THE TEAK ASHORE.
Exciting Scene at a Drawbridge That
Ended Unp easaotly for Three
Energetic Youths.
Oakland Office Sab; Francisco Call,"^
908 Broadway, Aug. 22. )
Three young men went to San Leandro
to-day to look for a rancher who they
claim is guilty of the basest ingratitude.
Tney are James Green, Sam Conyers and
Leon Collins and they all live in the vi
cinity of the Webster-street bridge.
Yesterday afternoon a rancher was driv-
ing a baliry horse on to the Alameda side
of the drawbridge at Webster street. The
animal got on the track and refused to go
any further. A narrow-gauge train was
signaled, but the efforts of the driver and
of several other people could not induce
the horse to move. The driver got out,
and as he did so tne approaches train
frightened the horse. It ran off, but in-
stead of going on the bridge it ran along
the trestle at the side.
As soon us it had gone about fifty feet it
swerved and fell into the estuary. A few
moments later it had kicked itself clear of
the cart and was swimming toward tbe
Golden Gate.
The three younsc men, who own a boat
on the estuary, got into it and started
after the animal. The horse was a good
swimmer and not at all desirous to be
turned from the course he had laid out
ior himself.
, Finally the boys lassoed him and began
to tow him to the beach. It was a hard
task as horse and tide were against them,
but they stuck to their worK, and when
they got near the shore a rope was thrown
and by its aid they managed to get the
animal on the bank.
The rancher told the boys that If they
fetched in his cart he would reward them
handsomely. The lads started out. in the
boat and half an hour later the cart and
harness, not very much injured, were on
li.c beach alongside the house.
The owner succeeded, with the help of
the boys, in hitching up, his team, after
repairing the harness with string which
they furnished. He then told Collins to
get in with him and he wcuid go uptown
and get some money for them. They drove
off, and a little later, when a few blocks
away, he made Collins get out of the cart,
and the ungrateful owner drove off.
Now the boys have declared veneeance
and gone to San Leandro, wiu- â  they have
a clew. They declare that they will take
the hone and cart tney recovered or else
will get salvage.
A CALL TO ARMS.
The Instructions for the Alliance
Club's Trip to Los
Angeies.
OAKLAND, Cai*. Aug. 22.â The follow
lowing call wai issued Friday by the Re
publican Alliance of Oakland concerning
their bombardment of Los Angeles on be
half of Republicanism this week:
Fellow-members: Your board of directors
has, through a proper committee, succeeded in
making fair arrangements with the railroad
company for toe special transportation of the
alliance from San Francisco to Pasadena and
Los Angeles and return. While we only se
cure from the company a round-trio rate of
$15 per capita, outside subscriptions from
many good friends of the alliance have come
forward and enabled us to meet all dehcieo
cips.
The alliance special will leave Oakland pier
at 7 o'clock on the evening of Friday, August
28, arriving in Los Angeles the next morning
about 8:30 o'clock. This will give us time to
pack our uniforms carefully iv advanoe, to
dive at home and breakfast next morning at
the point of destination. It affords your board
the utmost pleasure to be able to inform you
at this time that, through the efforts of your
commander, we have secured the services of
the Fifth Artillery Regiment, U. S. A., band,
which will accompany ut on our trip. In case
of Â» morning or afternoon meeting on Satur
day, the 29th inst., at Pasadena we will be ex
pected to take a prominent part in the same,
and upon this head you will be duly advised
on the train.
At the monster meeting at Los Angeles on
Saturday evening we are supposed to show the
people reildent of the "City ot the Angels"
what manner of men compose the Republican
Alliance of Oakland, and after which we will
bÂ« banqueted by the Republican dubs of that
city. The alliance special will leave Lcs
Angeles upon its return trip about C p. m. on
Sunday evening, reaching the pier in time for
the 8:15 boat for San t'ran-oi&co ou Monday
morning.
The following matters require your prompt
and considerate attention:
Kirmâ This pilgrimage must be carried out
dignifiediy, soberly, and it must be remem
bered, is in no sense a junketing trip.
Becondâ Uniforms must be cleaned up and
your accoutrements, such as flag handker
chiefs, white gloves and mouth pieces for
torches, provided for in advance and by indi
vidual member*.
Thinlâ Report in citizen's dress at the pier or
at Sixteenth-street station, carrying your
uniform in a satchel (duiy labeled with your
name and address), aÂ» we will not don s.n>e
until following momiog before arrival in Los
Angeles.
Fourth â Upon payment of your very mild
assessment you will be provided with a "trip
check" entitling you to, not on.y railroad
fare, but a sleeping-car berth during the
round trip. Your other expenses will amount
to just what yon choose to make them.
Fitthâ Brighten up your uniform buttons,
mend and clean your uniforms and leggings,
see to it that every man is nattily atiirtd
an<t looking bis best from head to toot.
Finally, we would impress upon each and
every member that tliis is a political trip,
made lor political purposes, and ;o advance
the best interests of the Repubi.can party in
the present campaign; the good name and in
fluence of the alliance rests with the rank and
file as well as with its civic ai.d military offi
cers; every man, whether he wears the in
signia of office or not, is expected to maintain
the dignity and creditof the organization, ana
in no wise depart a hair's breadth irom tbe
lines laid out ior gentlemen who are
the honored guests of an hospitable
people, desirous oi doing homage to
the best Republican organisation of
the kind in these United dtates.
Duty aliKe beckons and directs, and your
president and board of director- confidently
rely upon each individual member of the
alliance strlvti.j to mnke this remarkable nii
gr.mage such a pronounced success that addi
tional luster will be ad<ied to our already well
earned reputation as a bright and ever shining
Political light, admonishing our enemies that
McKinley will be our next President, nnd the
tll.ance live forever as an enduring evidence
of sound Republican doctrine.

C. B. RUSSELL RESIGNS,
An Intelligent Democrat Breaks
Away From the O.d
Party.
Fusion Between Democrats and Popu
lists Probableâ Local Items of
General Interest.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Aug. 22.â The Demo
cratic Central Club held a meeting last
night to devise ways and means for carry
| ing on its side of the political campaign.
Charles B. Russell, one of the brainy
Democrats in this city, and a member of
the executive committee, has cut away
from the party and also resigned his mem
bership in the club. His letter of resigna
tion gives the reasons for his act:
J. F.lves Esq., President Alameda Democratic
Clubâ Dear Sib: It is with rouen regret that 1
feel compelled to resign from the club of which
you are the honored president, and I do so
after mature consideration, although remain
ing loyal to the principles which in the past
have cost the .Democratic party so many
struggles, and which have been the founda
tion of its success with the plain peoDle.
But the hour has come wnen one who looks
upon the financial question as the leading
issue of the day must define Its position. I am
satisfied that the unlimited tinge of silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1, or even 32 to 1, would
! be an injury to the working classes, and would
' add to the number of multi-millionaires at
whose hands the Nation is now suffering.
. While the party might and probably would
be defeated on the question of tariff and in
come tax, 1 think it would be preferable to
: suffer defeat thereby than to gala victory with
the aid of financial jugglery. The free coinage
of silver, or paper or any commodity will not
prevent the gross extravagance whicn we find
m . municipal, S:ate and- National expendi
tures. These are some of our present troubles.
I sincerely hope for a continuance of the
friendship I have formed with members of the
club and that I may always adhere with them
to the lofty principles inculcated by our great
leader, GrovÂ«:r Cleveland. Faithfully yours,
C. B. Russell.
Fusion between the Populists and Demo
crats is probable, as the former have
started a Bryan silver club and ask the
assistance of the latter. A. F. St. sure,
Joseph Â£. Barber, G. W. Dennis, E. M.
Whaiey and E. 0. Crosby were appointed
a committee to assist in the organization.
The Hon. M. F. Tarpey was indorsed as a
candidate for the nomination of Congress
man for* the Third Congressional District.

908 Broadway, Aug. 22. f
St. Mary's football team has started out
with an ambition that augurs well ior a
igood record at the close of the season.
Manager J. J. Greeley is a San Francisoo
The Men Who Promise That St. Mary's Shall Make a Football Record During the Coming Season.
young man who is well known for his
achievements in the literary field and also
for his admirable qualities as a manager.
Under his management the football team
of St. Mary's College will without a doubt
rank among the foremost in the athletic
field.
In speaking this afternoon of football
prospects at the college, Manager Greeley
said : "The record of those who have
graduated from this institution is clear to
all and therefore needs no comment.
Their brilliant career after leaving college
is owing in a large degree to that physical
and manly appearance, combined with a
thorough knowledge, wbicn they contract
during their college days.
"Realizing mis important truth, namely,
that intellectual acquirements are helped
and made pleasant by the physical pow
ers as well a3 intellectual qualities, the stu
dents have organized a football team that
promises to outstrip any that have hith
erto appeared upon a college campus. The
members are younz men of brain and
muscle â two important factors in the line
of football. To predict a great future for
the football team for the coming season is
but to voice the sentiments of every one
who has seen toem practice. The team ia
comparatively lijiht, it is true, but what
they lack in weight is made up in grit,
speed and alacrity, and after all these are
the chief factors of a good football team.
As will be seen from the list of names
they all bail from the Golden State, with
a few exceptions.
"It may well be said of Bt. Mary's foot
ball team, as it was said of her baseball
team, that they hold the first rank among
amateurs. The very name of St. Mary's
has something magnetic about it that
maces her students climb the bill of sci
ence and conquer in the field of spores.
Most of the sturdy candidates of the
eleven need no introduction to the read
ers of The Call. McGuire, the center, is
a muscular and well-developed speci
men of humanity, weighing in condition
192 pounds, and is perfectly at home in
the game. The guards, Sullivan end But
ler, average 180 pounds, the former being
an experienced player. Butler is com
paratively a new man, but he is rapidly
developing into one of the quickest play
ers in the eleven.
"Cone of Montana and Hastings of San
Francisco, the late tackier of the Mount
Tamalpais eleven, are making a hard fight
for the position of tackle, and they will in
all probability make the team. Rattigan,
! who is well known about San Francisco
for his all-round playing, will hold down
right end. The position of left end will
fall either to Mahoney of Carson City or
Holmes of Yallejo.
"Behind the line the star material of the
college may be found. McCartney of
Napa, who has played frequently on the
college team for the last two years, will
don his canvas this season regularly and
play fullback. He bucks the line splendidly
ana is a kingpin punter. As for quarter
the team will eitlier play Freiernjuth of
Watsonville or Solen of Redwood City.
Both show considerable cleverness in
handing the ball and in interference.
â¢'Captain Mogan of San Francisco is an
energetio young man whose eagle eye will
not only deteci an error in his opponent,
but will find the goal under any difficulty.
The other half is J. Daly, the genial Ven
tura boy.
"The team will possibly meet Stockton
and Santa Cruz on the gridiron this sea
son, and from present indications will be
worthy representatives of their colleen
and Oakland. Santa Clara and St. Marys
will for the first time this year probably
meet in a contest similar to Stanford and
Berkeley."

A BUNKO GAME
ON CONGRESSMEN..
The Democracy Plans a
Novel and a Hard
Fusion Play.
EVERYBODY TO RESIGN
Then a Little Junta of B:sses
Is to Name Seven Fu
sion Candidates.
EARLY TKOTJBLE IS PROMISED
Ths Democratic State Central Com
mittee Takes Steps to Win
the Olds Again.
The State Democratic leaders yesterday
spent long hours in various secret confer
ences selecting the cards, the players and
tbe eteerers for another huge bunko
game, in which the Populists are to be the
victims.
A great Congressional fusion scheme,
hatched by the various conference com
mittees and sub-committees and their ad-
visers, was plunked into thÂ« meeting of
the Democratic State Central Committee
yesterday afternoon and formed the chief
topic of debate at various personal and
committee meetings after a long executive
session of the Democratic State Central
Committee was ended.
The new plan which various politi
cal manipulators are trying to push
throu h by the Democratic, Populist and
and Silver parties is that the six Demo
cratic and the six Populist Congressional
nominees which have been made at regu
lar conventions representing the people of
six of the seven districts shall all hand their
resignations to an appointed and a put-up
joint committee of fifteen. This would
leave the political situation nominally
clear of Congressional nominations as far
as the Democratic and Populist parties
are concerned.
Then tiis committee of fifteen, com
posed of six Democrats, six Populists and
three "silyerltes," is to name one candi
date in each of the seven Congressional
districts, which all parties are to be bound
to support.
This is a unique and a before-unheard-of
play in American party politics, and it
yields on the start forty promises of war,
misunderstandings, personal bitterness
and many revelations of the intrigues and
tricks of which political manipulators are
capable.
Twelve men named by the people are to
be ordered by a few bosses to step aside
and let a small junta of politicians, con
trolled by various influences, put ud a
Congressional ticket for the entire State
of California.
When the Democratic State Central
Committee met in the billiard-room of the
California Hotel at nearly 3 o'clock, with
Chairman Alford at the table, there was a
fair attendance ana many proxies for the
care of Secretary R. Jf. Troy.
Edward de la Cuesta of Santa Barbara
ami R. T. Pierc of Mono became mem
bers of the committee.
Then the brief resignation of another
goid Democrat was read ami promptly ac
cepted. It was from George T. Marye,
who like E. B. Pond and a host of other
leading Democrats in the State, ;s unable
to swallow Bryan, the Chicago anarchistic
platform and the amalgamation with the
Populists which the party leaders in this
State are trying to effect in a way that will
give the Democrats the best of it. Mr.
Marye gave no explanations in his brief
communication.
Gavin McNab, who looks' after all small
practical political advantages that may be
lying around loose, at once moved that
tne vacancy be filled by the election of
John F. McGovern, secretary of the Junta
general committee, who Mr. McNab said
was a popular business man and an active
and loyal Democrat. He was elected and
the Junta was further strengthened in the
btate Committee.
Secretary Iroy read the report of the
committee' on fusion, concerning presi
dential eleotors.which has been published.
The report which announced the with
drawal of four Democratic and five Popu
lint electors was approved, on motion of
Samuel firaunbart without a wont of de
bate. Slight applause lollowed the vote.
Then rose M. F. Tarpey, chairman of the
fusion or conference committee, who said
a few words, giving the ke> to the whole
Democratic play.
"In working out the detailaof the plan,"
said Mr. Tarpey, "the committee realized
the importance of the work and did every
thing in its power to get all that was pos
sible for the Democratic party."
Mr. Tarpey spoke of the noble electoral
candidates who had resigned, and then a
resolution of thanks to them, read by
Eugene N. Deuprey, was adopted with no
signs of opposition ur grudging. The reso
lution contained "offered themseves as a
sacrifice" and "proves a permanent debt
of gratitude," and gave th ir names as
Frank D. Nichol of Stockton, J. H. Me-
Cune of Solano and Isidore Gutte and
P. M. Wellin of San Francisco. These
gentlemen will receive beautifully en
grossed copies of the resoluion because
the motion of W. P. Sullivan to that end
was carried.
The really important business before the
committee "was yet to come and it was

announced by Mr. Tarpey to be Â» further
report oi the fusion committee concern
ing Congressional affairs. It was decided
to go into executive session in this matter
and the executive session continued until
nearly 6 o'clocfc.
Tarpey presented the fusion commit
tee's resolution calling for joint Demo
cratic and Populist Congressional conven
tions in the Third District, as given in
yesterday 'B Call, and this resolution was
approved after A. Caminetti of tbe fusion
committee, Congressman Manuire, who
was present with four proxies; J. W.
Mitchell of Los Angeles, Raleigh Barcar
and others had bad their say in favor of
fusion wnerever the Democratic party had
no ghost of a show in the Congressional
fights.
Tarpey presented a further recommenda
tion of the joint conference committee,
which involved in a general way a com
plete plan of Congressional fusion. The
joint conference committee bad named a
sub-committee of three, composed of A.
Caminetti for the Democrats, J. D. Dore
of the Populists and \V. P. Lawlor of the
Silverites, to prepare a detailed plan, and
Mr. Caminetti arrived on tbe scene from a
meeting of this sub-committee, which had
not completed any detailtd plan, which
met again last night and which will re
port its plan at a meeting of the joint con
ference committee to be held next Tues
day.
However, Mr. Camineiti bad much to
say along with others on tbe broad plan of
Congressional fusion at ireue. This plan
was that there be constituted a new joint
fusion committee of fifteen, composed of
six Democrats, six Populist* and three Sil
verites, which should have large jurisdic
tion, powers and discretion. This com
mittee was to be empowered to require all
the Democralio and Populist candidates
for Congress to present to it their resigna
tions as a preliminary.
Then tbii committee should proceed to
agree upon one joint candidate in each
district, naming either the existing Demo
cratic or Populist candidate or a new one.
If any candidate should refuse to submit
bis resignation to this committee, aban
don his rights given him by the peopie of
his district or refuse to abide by the deci
sion of tbe committee, then that candidate
is to be repudiated, as far as possible, by
the State authorities of bis party, con
demned as undeserving of the support of
the party and the candidate agreed upon
shall receive the moral support of the
three parties.
Thb interesting proposition was dis
cussed at great length. Congressman Ma
guire stated that his resignation wonld
cheerfully ana promptly reach the com
mittee. Mr. Maguire was peculiarly sate
in making this nominal surrender and
sacrifice Â«3 the Populists have all aluii_Â«
declared that they would not make an op
posing nomination anyhow.
Harry W. Patton, who was nominated
the other day by the Democrats of the
Seventh District,made asimilarannounce
ment. John N. Wood, chairman of the
Congressional committee of the Second
District, was present and said that while
he could not speaic autnorjtaiively for
Marion de Vries. he believed that Mr. de
Yries would accede to tbe plan.
The scheme was approved m a general
way, the appointment of the Democratic
committee of six was provided for, and
tbe committee adjourned to await the
working out ot tbe hardest deal ever at-
Umped in the politics of California.
On Monday tbe Populist State Central
Committee will deal with all tin*. A meet
ing of tne present joint conference com
mittee is scheduled for Tuesday, when
further details of the plan will be consid
ered, and meantime back rooms will be
rife with arguments and connubiating.

WHEELS WILL
HAVE TO PAY,
No Longer to Be Carried
Free on the Ferry-
Boats.
FIAT ALREADY ISSUED.
The New Order of Things to Go
Into Effect on September
First
CYCLING CIRCLES EXCITED.
Organized Effort to Be Made to CirÂ«
cumvent the Imposition of
This Tax.
Whoever desires to carry a bicycle on
any train or boat of the Southern Pacific
Company after the Ist of September will
have to pay a tax to that corporation.
Even should the cyclist's trip extend no
further than Oakland, Berkeley or Ala
meda from San Francisco, he will be
forced to contribute the sum of ten cents
to the coffers of Huntington. Crocker et al.
Circular letters have been sent out to all
the agents of the Southern Pacific Com
pany at the stations between which bi
cycles are now carried free of charge, in
structing them as follows:
Commencing September 1, 1896. 29 cents
â will be the charge for the transportation in
baggajre-car of a bicycle, a tricycle or a baby
carriage between any two point*.
The term "bicycle" is here used in its gen
eral sense, as including the wheel commonly
called a "tandem."
Passes must not be recognized as covering a
free carriage of the articles above named.
This means thnt wheels carried between
San Francisco, Benicia, Livermore, Mar-
T'nez. Vallejo. San Jose and any interme
diate point will have to be paid lor after
tbe date mentioned.
Instructions have also been issued pro
viding for tne collection of 10 cents for
each bicvele carried across the bay in
either direction on the regular ferries, and
five cents on thÂ»Â» creek route.
This action has been under considera
tion for several months, and the matter is
one that has caused lone and labored dis
cussions nmons the ruling powers of the
grÂ«>at railroad monopoly.
On the Ist of July the same policy was
adopted with reference to Los Angeles, in
connection with the other lines which
enter that city, but it was not then
thought expedient to apply it to the terri
tory about San Francisco.
The reason assigned by the railroad
people for this charge is that bicycles take
up valuable room on the train and fre
quently delay trains by the time con
sumed in storing them. The real reason
is, however, that the Southern Pacific has
been inspired to the proposed course by
tho fact that it is one of tne very few roads
which are now not making any charge for
wheels carried to near-by points and does
not intend to lonper forego the oppor
tunity of attempting to increase its reve
nue at the expense of the wheelmen.
It was believed that this departure
would not be undertaken until after the
election, in order not to excite the cyclists
to aoton which would result in the choice
of legislator" who would be pledged to the
rmssaee of a bill providing for the free
carriage of bicyles as batrgaee everywhere
within the State. Sucn a law is now in
force in New York, and it is highly prob
able that united and early action will be
taken by the wheelmen of the entire State
to secure similar privileges for the riders
of this State.
Thousands of people in the course of the
week cross the bay with wheels, some only
on pleasure bent, others who take their
wheels with them as a means of â¢caching:
their places of business or their homes
with facility and without expense. Many
live in sections removett from convenient
railroad or streetcar connection across the
bay, and these will either have to change
their residences and perhaps sell their
homes or pay this enforced tribute to the
Southern Pacific Company. It is this class
of residents â they who have given way to
the allurements of suburban charms â who
will be hardest hit by the new order of
thing?.
Those who ride for pleasure have the
remedy in their own hands to a large ex
tent, and, from expressions heard yester
day, they are disposed to apply it with
promptness and vigor. Instead of riding
for a distance of fifty miles in one direc
tion and then taking a train back to the
starting point, this class of cyclists will
ride a less distance from their home ana
will use thfir wheel in both directions.
Justice of tbe Peace Frank H. Kerrigan,
who is chief consul of the North California
Division of the League of American
Wheelmen, was full of the new order of
things when seen yesterday.
'â¢We have known of this matter for
some time," he said, "and we are pre
pared to meet it in the proper and most
effective matter. The Southern Pacific
Company has been looking for a chance to
'cinch' the cyclists of San Francisco, Oak
land, Alameda and neighborine cowns for
a long time, and the thing that we are
most thankful for is that the new regula
tions have gone into effect before election
time so that we can show the railroad
company the true strength of wheelmen
in this portion of the State.
"We know the strength of the ballot and
how it can be used, and we propose to see
that the cyclists of California, and particu
larly the league members, are not given
the worst of it.
"More than a week ajro information
came to local leapue officials that the
Southern Pacific officials would try to
charge for wheels crossing the ferries, but
it has not bothered us much, because we
know that such matters are adjustable and
that with the proper pressure brought to
bear we shall prevail.
"The Southern Pacific Company appa
rently does not realize that the thousands
of wheelmen in San Francisco and the
suburban towns about it are a unit on the
question of charges for wheels, and that
with our great strength we are quite likely
to elect a Legislature that will block any
such scheme as now proposed. We have
already had conferences with the repre
sentatives of a number of important towns
within easy distance of San FranciÃco, and
all are enthusiastic in favor of fighting this
matter to the bitter end.
"Meetings of the local division of the
league and of the Associated Cyclinc clubs
have already been decided on, and the
fight will be fairly under way in a few
days."
ESTABLISHING THE LINE.
Homers "Will Fly To-Day Under the
Auspices of the Chamber of
Commerce.
The first sending out of homing pigeons
under the encouragement of the Chamber
of Commerce, procured from the lofts of
A. Carlisle, will take place to-day. The
birds are furnisned free for the use of the
Chamber of Commerce by Mr. Carlisle,
who has been ready to carry out nis lib
eral offer in this connection at tiie earliest
convenience. The first few flights of birds
will necessarily be somewhat experimental,
and aÂ« a consequence no messages will be
diepatched just yet. As soon as the birds
are familiar with the sea route the regular
sending of messages will begin. Tne first
work in this connection will be performed
by pigeons which will be sent out on the
steamer Queen on her whaling and sight
seeing cruise. There will be thirty birds,
which will be flown in installments â some
irom the scene of the steamer wrecks and
others from the farthest distance reached
by the excursionists. No attempt will be
made for a record. A plan in connection
with the pigeon-Hying later on is to estab
lisn a bulletin-board to contain regular
information for shippers concerning the
pigeons and the news they bring, and this
may be located in the "Merchants' Ex
change.

DAIRYMEN ARE ALARMED
Ask the Authorities to Go Slow
in the Work of Condemn
ing Cattle.
Major Alvord ct the Department of
Agriculture to Visi*. tbe Coast
Next Month.
The directors of the State Dairymen's
Association mci yesterday at their office,
113 Davis street, and much business of
importance to the trade was transacted.
There were present: Directors James
Maillard of Marin County, president;
William Niles of Los Angeles, F. H.
Green of San Francisco, A. P. Martin of
Petaluma, H. M. Le Baron of Valley Ford
and Samuel Â£. Watson of San Francisco,
secretary.
The principal topic of discussion before
the board was the inspection of dairy
herds. In this connection a letter was read
from Major E. Alvord, chief of the dairy
division, Department of Agriculture, who
will make an official visit to the State in
September.
"I note," he said, "the tubercu
losis excitement (very unfortunate and
needless) and the extreme action being
taken. I will try to give this particular
attention iii your Slate." Major Alvord's
opinion is based upon clippings sent him
by the dairymen.
The laws of several States in regard to
the condemnation of cattle were discussed,
that of Massachusetts particularly being
commented upon favorably. In that
State cattle condemned for disease are
paid for by the State, one-half their value
being allowed the owner, provided he has
made no effort to conceal the disease.
As a result ol the discussion the follow
ing resolution was passed:
Wherkas, It is evident to the directors of
the California Dairy Association that extreme
measures are liable to be taken in the matter
of tuberculosis, and that great loss would ac
crue to the dairy interests oi the State from
general condemnation of cattle, and believing
that the most careiul inquiry should be made
into the issue involved before further action is
taken, therefore it is
Resolved, That the legislative oommittee of
this association â enter into communication
with other dairy associations for the purpose
of securing co-operation in State legislation
upon this subject.
W. P. Brewer of San Ma*eo was elected
to fill a vacancy in the board of directors,
and the legislative committee was in
creased to ,hve by the addition of W. P.
Breme and George Dutton.
Tbe appointment of Bamuel E. Watson
and W. H.Saylor superintendents of dairy
exhibits at the State Fair was approved.
It was announced the World's Fair stand
ard for judging butter will be used at ti.e
State Fair.
A committee consisting of Messrs. Niles,
Green and Watson was appointed to meet
Major Alvord at Sacramento on the 15th
of next month. Major Alvord will be in
Sacramento during the State Fair and will
be in this City durinst the dairymen's con
vention which will be in session the 29th
and 30th of September. He will be asked
to address the convention. There will also
be speakers present from Stanford, Berke
ley and the Academy of Sciences. The
dairymen hope to eet a consensus of
scientific opinion upon the tuberculosis
question, which is at present their main
trouble.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1896.
GORGED HIMSELF
AND WON A BET,
Miller Was "No Hog," So
Quit After Sixty-
Six Eggs.
VANaHISHED HIS RIVAL.
Employes of the Clay-Street
Market Ate to a Finish
for Coin.
BROWNLEY SWALLOWED SIXTY
A Crowd Watched^ the Gourmands
Devour Fried, Boiled, Scram
bled and Raw Eggs.
San Francisco has added a new star to
her constellation of celebrities. Ernest
Miller has established a reputation as an
What Was Seen by Those Who Were Present at the Egg-
Eating; Contest.
egg-eater, whose capacity few may hope to
surpass.
Yesterday forenoon Miller devoured
sixty-six hen's eggs while his opponent
collapsed after gulping down his sixtieth.
The match was arranged a week ago and
grew out of a dispute.
Ernest Miller is a butcher i-n the Clay
street market, wher j he is employed by
the Uri Company, for which his opponent,
Sam Brownley, works as a stableman.
Miller is 38 years of ape, tall, slim, cadaver
ous and habitually hungry-looking, but
appearances are deceptive. Brownley is 32
years of age, is shorter and of a more
rotund form.
Yesterday forenoon at 10 o'clock they
met in the market to ao or die for the
honors that were in sight and for fifteen
dozen eegs, which they hoped to pit out
of sight, incidentally there was a bet of
$5 a side and the cost of the eggs and the
exDense of cooking them.
The contestants visited A. Fodera's stall
and bargained for the eggs.
At 10:20 o'clock everything was in readi
ness, and Miller and Brownley, mounted
on stools in front of the" restaurant
counter in tbe center of the market, began
their task. Kaufman Wertheimer, man
ager of the Uri Company, acted as judge,
stake-holder and scorer.
The first half dozen passed by the board
like so much icecream at a Fourth of July
picnic. An interested crowd had gath
ered.
The men gulped their eggs down regu
larly and deliberately in batches of a half
dozen prepared at a time. The crowd was
silent and interested.
A<< the courses varied with boiled eggs,
fried eggs, raw eggs, scrambled eggs,
shirred eggs, poached eggs and even baked
eggs, the crowd watched with alarm tiie
growing pallor of Brownley's face. But
he stuck to his work and kept brushing
away the cold perspiration that stood out
in beads on his forehead.
Miller had downed six soft boiled, thirty
raw. another six soft boiled, eighteen
fried and was finishing the fourth of
another raw batch, when there was an
agonized gulp from his rival. "Umph! I
guess I'm about full," was all he said as
he rolled off his stool and was assisted out
of the ring by his friends.
By the terras of the match Miller had
the match then, for the first to quit was
loser. Brownley had devoured thirty-six
soft-boiled, twelve scrambled, and twelve
fried.
"Keep it up," some one called out en
couragingly to Miller, "there are plenty
more pres."
Ana Miller ate the two remaining on his
plate, finishing strong with sixty-six ezgs
and a big cup of coffee just as it was
twenty minutes to 12 o'clock, after eating
for an hour and twenty minute?.
Then some one urged the victor to goon
and outdo himself. But Miller tnrned a
withering glance in the direction of that
man, and remarked, "I ain't no hog, I
guess I know when I've got enough."
INSURANCE DID NOT PAY.
The Fire Association of Philadelphia
Adopts a New Plan.
Fire-insurance circles were surprised
yesterday at the latest change which was
announced in one of the leading offices.
The more so was this news a good subject
for gossip among insurance men when it
was said that this same change was only
one of many that began recently, and were
expected to occur from time to time.
The office affected is that of the local
agency of the Fire Association of Phila
delphia.
Csesar Bertheau is the general manager
of this concern, his jurisdiction extending
all over the Pacific Coast States. Under
the new regime, however, he is to be local
agent of the corporation on a commission
basis.
This means that the general manager
ship of the Fire Association of Philadel
phia, in San Francisco, will be abolished,
if, indeed, it has not already become a
thing of the past.
The abolition of a general office carries
with it the reduction of a large staff oi
clerks and other insurance men, all trained
in their special departments; also the re
ductions of office accommodations, or more
likely the dispensing of the whole piant
and employes. It is simply a contrac
tion of business expenses, and methods
under unfavorable conditions such as have
prevailed for some time past in the local
fire insurance field, since a rate war de
moralized profits.
The last general office to be withdrawn
was the very considerable one of the Con
tinental Insurance Company of New
York, shortly after that concern haa pur
chased the old Pacific Bank building for
its Pacific Coast headquarters. Mr. Ber
thau's company follows, making him the
local agent, as tbe Continental did forj.
D. Maxwell upon retiring its general man
ager.
The Fire Association of Philadelphia is
an important American company with
assets of $5,500,000, and it did a fair busi
ness on this coast. Quite recently J. M.
Beck, its former general manager here,
was transferred to the Chicago office, there
to be assistant general manager. The
moving of Mr. Beck is said to have been
the first steD in the change that took
place yesterday.
Santa Clara land Sold.
Easton, Eldridge & Co.'s excursion auc
tion sale to Mountain View yesterday for
the Martin Murphy estate was well attended,
and prices realized averaged about the same
as at the first sale for the same estate, which
was made June 29. Five coaches were filled
with excursionists. About 350 people at
tended the sale from San Francisco, meeting
the excursion train f*om San Jose with about
200 additional excursionists. About 1000
people were on the ground. All the land re
maining, 218 acres, was sold, the price being
$26,300.
A HOLD-UP OR A JOKE?
But Attorney Silva's Assailants
Counted Without Marshal
Creed.
Only $1 15 on tbe Fair of Sausalito
Lightsâ Successful Concert at
Mill Valley.
SAUSALITO, Cal., Aug. 21.â Jogging
along serenely in the moonlight, with no
thought of robbers or anything else, At
torney Sylva, our city lepal light, was
homeward bound at an early hour this
morning from Larkspur. He had trans
acted his business satisfactorily, had en
joyed a hearty duck dinner and was call
ins back once in a while to his friend,
Marshal Creed, who was In a buggy be
hind him.
They had just reached the summit of
the hill by Alto station, when two men
jumped from the side of the road and, in
loud tones, ordered Sylva to throw up his
hands, at the same time covering him
with their guns.
Bylva can use a pistol himself, but there
was no time, and he complied with the
request quickly.
The two robbers, however, had no
thoughts of Creed, the sturdy Marshal of
Sausalito, wno, as soon as he saw his
friend Adolphus' plight, jumped from his
buggy, pullod his pun and covered the
two men in turns. They gave in at once,
were handcuffed and marched to San
ltafael, where they now he in durance
vile awaiting trial next Monday.
They are named Jones and Anderson,
and belong to this county. They claim
their action was a joke and that they were
camping close by, but probably the joke
wa-i played on the wrong person.
The total cash on Creed and Sylva only
amounted to $1 15.

Mr. John L. Stoddard, the most noted
lecturer in America to-day, who is now

says of that famous resort: "The sublime
scenes of our natural wonderland surpass

of the Yellowstone is of course thÂ« climax.
As I beheld it to-day, its lone kaleido

A DUTCH BARONS
FEARFUL THREATS
Blue-Blooded William G.
Shreckkenburg Gets
Into Prison.
WOULD KILL HIS WIFE.
Accused of Administering a
Drug and Practicing Ex
tortion.
SUIT FILED FOR DIVORCE.
The Prisoner Claims Noble Lineage
and Speaks Fluently in S;x
Different Tongues.
Baron William G. Shreckkenburg rests
out at the City Prison, in a cold steel cell,
sad lot for a man of so noble a lineage
and such a name. The primal cause of
the Baron's ignoble position is threaten
ing to kill the wife of his bosom, but that
is not all of the Baron's infelicity, by any
means. There is, incidentally, a suit for
divorce on several well defined and very
strong charges.
Schrekkenburg, who hails from Amster
dam, and claims to be a Dutch Baron,
came to San Francisco last March, and
has at various times exercised his muscles
in serving viands to the patrons of the
Palace Hotel and the Maison Doree. The
rest of the time he spent in loafing and
disposing of the $50 a month he received
from some source or otner. He himself
has said it was received from blue-blooded
relatives in the Netherlands.
In the latter part of April or the early
part of May of the present year, the Baron
met Miss Frances K. La'roon, who has
lived in this City for the last four years,
but whose parents live in Monterey. The
young lady is possessed of certain valua
ble property near her native city, and in
addition has about $4000 otfssooo in a sav
ings bank here.
The two kept company until July 29,
when they were married at the new City
Hall by Justice Cook. Rooms were at
once taken on Mason street, near Eddy.
Last Monday suit for divorce was
brought and the case assigned to Judge
Hebbard's court. In this suit tne lady is
represented by Attorney Joseph A.
Mitchell. The defendant's time in which
to answer will expire next Thursday.
The complaint states some very curious
things, such, however, the complaint itself
says, as might be expected from a man ol
title. The first charge is that defendant
has continuously treated plaintiff in a
cruel and inhuman manner, and that he
has frequently applied vile and indecent
epithets to her.
The second charge is that on July 30. the
day subsequent to marriage, the plaintiff
believes defendant administered adrut; to
her in their apartments on Mason street,
and that while she was in a weak and over
powered condition he demanded that she
â ign a check in his favor for a large sum
of money. If she refused to do this, the
complaint states, he asserted he would
kill lier.
As soon as she was able, or on August 1,
the woman says she left Shreckkenburg
and took up quarters in another lodging
house on the same street, fearing that be
would carry his threat into execution. It
is mentioned that he immediately followed
her and took up quarters on the lower
floor of the house, where he could badger
and threaten her as she came and went.
The next charge is that Shreckkenburg
maliciously circulated false reports about
his wife, with the view of forcing her to
give him money. He has further, she
says, not only refused to pay a cent toward
her support, but left her to pay several
small bills of his own. This, the corn
plaiut incidentally mentions, is ample
proof of his blue blood.
On the night of August 14, Mrs. Shreck
kenburg cnarges, her husband forced his
way into tbe room where she was reclining
on a lounge and violently hauled her
around the room, declaring that if
she would give him $100 ail would
be well, but otherwise he would
"fix" her so she could not tell who did ft
On account of his actions she called in a po
liceman, who ejected the infuriated Baron
without ceremony. Since then she has
been, she says, in a state of nervous pros
tration.
When the papers for divorce were served
on Shreckkenburg. Attorney Mitchell says
he was very abusive, and said in the pres
ence of several that he would kill his wife,
whether she obtained a divorce or not.
Friday night the Baron's wife says he
went to her room with a large knife in
his hand, which he flourished in a very
suggestive manner, and used most abusive
language toward her. A warrant was
issued for his arrest on the ground of
threatening to commit murder.
Besides being an accomplished linguist
the Baron is said to have traveled all over
the world, coming here directly from
Denver, and to have acted as interpreter
for distinguished Americans traveling on
the Continent.
M. F. TARPEY'S POSITION
He Cxplaina a Variety of Matter* and
Makes Some Quite Interesting
Statements.
The following communication has been
received from M. F. Tarpey:
To the Editor of the San Francisco Callâ Dear
Sir: lour issue ol this morniug on the thir
teenth page contains a coiumn of mutter
headed In double-leaded type, "Tarpey's
Plumes Smoothed Down," which is so entirely
incorrect that 1 request you to publish this
correction, and give it equal prominence with
tne anicle of this morning which 1 com
plain of.
Firstâ There is no fight between Warren
tuglish aud myself for the nomination for
Congressman in the Third District. Mr. Eng-
! iB Yj s >i. am . lnform ed, seeking the nomination
in the district, and many ol my friends are
so.iciting me to permit the use of my name in
the same counection.
Secondâ l was not a candidate for delegato
to the National Democratic Convention at all,
nor was my name canvassed, to my knowl
edge, in that connectionâ my name was men
tioned to succeed myself on the National Com
mittee Mr. Dwyer was selected to succeed
me and that action of the delegation has
never been criticized by me, nor have I critl-
Cl Â«d any individual for that act.
thirdâ There is no "plan" to "put up Tarpey
for the soie purpose of beating Warren tng
lish, ana 'Tarpey being the most available
man, is being used by Dagsrett for that pur
pose, nor is there any -'plan 5 ' to do, or not to
ao, anything in that or in any other matter in
which 1 am personally connected, and I did
not refuse "to enter the contest except War
ren English should support me "
Fourthâ l do upt believe Mr. Daggett or any
other man controls the Democratic State Cen
.. Committee, and I do not believo Mr. Dag
lietthad any more to do with my appointment
by Wiliam Alford thau the man in the moon
had.
i,-> F nl lh i"T'^ Rr P e y w *s then in a position where
he could dictate." I have not used my position
for any purpose other than that to serve the
Democratic party to the best of my ability
without one thought of a personal advantage.

all, nor is there one word of truth In the fol
lowing paragraph: "The plan was then pro
posed that the Populists indorse Tarpey for the
Third District in return for the Democratic in
dorsement of the Populist candidate in the
First."
Seventhâ "Tarpey believes that he can now
get the Populist nomination."
There is do truth whatever in any of the
following: "Warren English and Tarpey had
a conference to-day and it is hinted as among
the possibilities that Tarpey will withdraw
and that Warren English will not."
I saw Warren English yesterday; shook hands
with him and passed the ordinary courtesies
of the de.y: nothing more. Of the further
matter contained in the article I have no
personal knowledge, and therefore will not
comment upon it.
To conclude, I have not seen Mr. Daggett
since my return from the East; have not seen
him for nearly five months, having left here
on April 1 last, since which time I have not
seen or spoken with the gentleman.

The human mind is a curious study.
Its likes and dislikes, its breadth and little
ness, its exultation and its despair are
sources of continual surprise to the ob
server. When he seeks to fathom the
causes of its mysterious workings it be
comes the chief of all puzzles. Easily
guided, it can yet never be compelled.
There is that in its nature which refuses
to accept impressions imposed upon it
from without. In this respect it may
well be compared to a volume of water,
which may easily be deflected in its course
but which no amount of pressure can
otherwise affect.
We talk glibly about changing our
minds and the minds of other people, as
if the process involved nothing more
than the substitution of one opinion for
another. But we know very well, if we
only pause to consider the matter, that
opinions do not always direct mental
action. It is possible to hold to an idea
even when we have been convinced that
it is wrong. This fact has been so uni
versally recognized in practical life that it
IscMiiljnr
Never an earth-born branch before
The wefght of such weird fruitage bore-
Bore through the night, while beading dews
Their chrism to that cold brow refuse
And tell their ros'ry o'er and o'er.
Great Syrian stars look sofly down
Upon the proild embattled town ;
And Jewish maidens, dreamy-eyed,
Sang songs of love, sang low and sighed
That love, love only, was life's crown.
And when the moon came, golden-plumed,
With Orient rose and myrrh perfumed,
The tree that bore black Judas there
Had died of horror and despair â
The sinless by his sin consumed.
" Behold the dead borne by the dead,
A miracle ! " with awe they said ;
And went their old accustomed ways
Till in the storm of coming days
That chill of death had wider spread.
If this were all, 'twere better so,
And all the years would brighter flow ;
But, lo! we pause and think of this,
That in that one betrayal kiss
Was caught and sown a world of woe. /
That swift cold touch of Christ's pale cheek
Of man's whole treason was the reek,
And thence repelled for aye became
A plague and red consuming flame,
Whose trail is ashes, gray and bleak.
The fkkle maiden's roseâ sweet lie
When lips meet lips and wild doubts die â
The faithless wife's serene caress,
The very balm of blessedness,
None can evade, none can deny.
The treachery of statesmen great,
The blacker wrongs that stab the state-
False friendship, aye, and everywhere
The masks that fawning traitors wear
Are Judas-flowers, blooming late.
E'en here while politicians rage,
Empurpled by the sunset age,
Betrayal lips, with flying foam,
Are desecrating hall and home
And lie to lie throws down the gage.
And thus, O tree,- by Hinnom's vale,
Whose silence is a sadder wail,
We share the blight that ruined theeâ
Iscariot's kiss and curse have we,
And Fate goes by stern-browed and pale.
Gone are the splendid courts of ease,
But still, from brimming chalices,
The Syrian stars pour forth their gold
And watch it with a joy untold
Flow over long-hushed agonies.
Gone, long gone, the Temple's throng,
The concubines, the wine and song,
And yet, though far, O fateful tree !
Thou teachest how with truth may be
The immortality of wrong.
! was lons ago embodied in the adage
â  which declares:
A man convinced against his will
Is of tbe same opinion still.
A wise saw this, for it not only states a
{ fact but points out the reason for it. Will
is evidently a factor in the . case, having
power to nullify a clear mental perception
I when it is unwelcome, and even to drive
it out. This imperious will that refuses
obedience to the intellect and sets up an
; authority of its own is nevertheless easily
j swayed by our dominant desires. Like all
\ other forces, it waits for some motive to
set it in action. Whether it be good or
baa, noble or ignoble, it is desire that gives
bent to our faculties and rouses will to do
its part. Therefore desire is the real
! source of action and lies at the root of all
I change.
Those who are successful in guiding the
i development of mind follow intuitively,
â  when not by knowledge, the method indi
cated by these facts. A wise teacher never
j attempts to force the mind of his pupil,

to action. The information tnat he offers
is intended to convince his hearers of the
justness of his appeal, and can in no wise
!be omitted. But it is not information
! that makes the orator. The fire and force
â  of language that stir the blood and rouse
; the sleeping energies of the soul leap only
from a heart unkindled by desire. Nor
can any simulated enthusiasm produce
the same effect, though for a r-easou de
ceitful phrases may allure. There is a
certain contagion in thought and feeling
aye, even in character, that tends to like
ness, and forbids that sturdy impulses
shall be generated by pretenses, except it
be by a sort of reflex action, as when the
presence of disease urges us to hygienic
precautions. Time furnishes the true
test. A false note will not long vibrate in
the heart, while the voice of truth re
| sounds in an undertone through all the
din of life.
Mobs are stirred by appeal to prejudice
and passion. It is a switt fire that burns
i with fury, but soon dies out. Lasting im
pressions are not made that way. The
permanent part of man's nature is intelli
gence, that calm perception of truth which
regards ideas and events in a wholly dis
passionate way. Conscience is its guiding
light, and its desires are for the attain
ment of lasting good. While mere physi
cal magnetism, by its warmth, may stir
the passions of a crowd, it leaves the inner
judge in each untouched. When the
storm of emotion has swept by it is he who
mafces final decision and who suffers or
enjoys the result of action. It may then
| appear that the passion was a temporary
insanity, under whose influence reason,
judgment and even common sense have
been sacrificed. It is, indeed, a fine line
that divides passion from insanity. It
only needs to De sufficiently intense to
overwhelm reason as effectually as does
mental disease.
The orator who is fired by love of hu
manity and a desire to uplift society will
address his appeal to the nobler nature.
And this better self exists in every one.
It is not the result of education, or of
social advantages, but belongs to every
human being. Indeed, it may well be
called the real man in each of us, for who
will contend thai the fiery passions which
sweep over his soul are really himself?
The inner man endures through all these
experiences, changing slowly and only as
the impulse to change touches the source
of real being. Desire must be awakened
in that inner self or permanent part of
human nature. As its desires are net
passional, but intelligent, the only way to
permanent improvement is by the eleva
tion of ideals. He alone who prefers the
welfare of his fellow-men to a transient
personal popularity will be likely to
adopt this method, but in the end he
alone succeeds. He will lose the wages of
a time-server, but when accounts are
squared, perhaps long after, it will be
found that his idea prevailed.
Is not this the history of the world?
What has become oi the armies of selfish
leaders who preyed upon human passion
in order that they might gain wealth or
influence? In no long time those physical
selves for whom they sacrificed so much
were rotting in dishonored graves. But
the heroes who sacrificed themselves, the
martyrs to truth and justice, as well as
the few great inspirers who were beloved
in their day and generation, succeed in
making of their dream a reality. Tbeir
bodies may fall long before the conflict is
ended, but like John Brown, their "souls
go marching on."
Great speeches that are remembered as
epochs in political or national history have
always embodied somewhat of this char
acter. They touched not only upon vital
but upon lasting issues, whose forms alone
are subject to change, according to vary
ing environment. Love of country, the
innate passion of the soul for freedom, are
the same in all times. Desire for progress
and for that measure of peace in which
alone progress is possible are equally
universal among civilized "peoples. The
orator who truly appeals to these senti
ments will find sure response. He has
touched a chord that vibrates in unison
with the wider life of humanity, l that
serene intelligence of which his inner self
is a part. Therefore have his words power
to move and to live also, even when the
storms of passion apparently so overpow
ering have wrought their transient effects
and been forgotten. Mercib M. Thirds.

Yam From NeWark
John Dugan, the genial proprietor of
the Newark Hotel, at Newark, which is
on tbe narrow-gauge road running out of
Alameda to San Jose, has discovered a way
to circumvent the picnic hoodlum, the
terror of the country folk whose domain
he invades when be goes on the summer
Sunday picnic.
The picnic trains generally stop at New
ark for water and then the hoodlum places
himself largely in evidence.
DAN M. MURPHY'S FAMOUS DEERHOUNDS..
Barrooms are his special delight, and j
often, particularly when the picnic is
homeward bound, the country landlord |
counts himself lucky if any of his glass- 1
ware escapes breakage. Indeed, instances
have occurred where everything breakable
was smashed and the crowd took to its
heels without paying for the damage when
the warning bell of the engine told that
the train was about to start.
Dugan stood one invasion of tnis kind
and then looked around for a remedy
other than the shotgun, which he was
tempted to use. The result of his delibera
tions came out on the next Sunday. Tim
Cronin and a number of other choice
coursing spirits were sitting about the
veranda and in the barroom when a re
turning picnic train hove in sight down
tbe road.
"Clear out, every mother's son of you,"
yelled Dugan. "Out the back way, and
don't ask questions. I'm going to close
up. I'll tell you why later. '
The crowd, Dugan among them* went
out the rear door when those in the front
bad been closed, and wandered around to
see the train come in. Suddenly Cronin
looked at the front door, and there to his
amazement saw the somber crape that in
dicated a death in the Dugan family.
"John Dugan, there is no one deadâ"
he began.
"Hold your tongue, Tim Cronin," inter
rupted Dugan, "watch the 'hoods.'" By
this time the train was at a standstil, and
a crowd of already intoxicated young
fellows jumped from the train and made
a rush for Dugan's place.
They wete almost at the door before
they saw the crape, and then they fell
back in awe. One glance at that settled it,
and they wandered sadly and thirstily
away to look for refreshments and trouble.
When the bell of the engine announced
that the train was about to pull out,
Dugan took down the crape, opened tha
doors and invited the crowd thusly:
"Come : take something with the house,
everybody. This was a lucky day for me,
and the crape is a great scheme."

Of the Tlvas Camp
Vhe tfii'g j(nnual 7)eer~JlÂ£unt in the Santa
Clara Valley
In an ideal spot near the Gilroy dam on
the U vas Creek is encamped the largest
deer-hunting party ever organized in this
State. The party consists of over 100
men, women and children and some 50
deerhounds.
No prettier spot could have been se
lected than the flat where the camp is
made. It consists of a plain nearly a mile
long by half a mile wide on the east bank
of the TJvas. The grounds are dotted
with nuge oaks, whose protruding arms
form a massive canopy, from which hang
massive portieres of Spanish moss.
The hills to the west of the camp are
nearly free from underbrush. Clumps of
oaks and other trees afford natural hid
ing-places for the deer. Taken all in all,
the spot on the Uvas is as natural a deer
park and as ideal a spot for camping as
could be found in the State.
The annual deer bunt is the outcome of
similar hunts inaugurated by Isaac Bran
ham. Dr. Lees and other pioneers some
forty years ago. Many of the men now in
camp hunted as boys with "Uncle Ike"
Branhara, and the hounds on the chase
are descendants of the same hounds im
ported by the latter nearly forty years
ago. The hunt which was inaugurated
then with but a few followers has now
grown to an immense size, and the annual
outing is looked forward to with pleasure
by all sportsmen in the county, who every

families, spend some ten days in camp.
For the past few years Vie Poncelet and
Dave Bulmore have oeen the promoters of
the hunt, and the campers have come to
be known as the Balmore-Poncelet party.
Camp was opened Saturday, August 16.
The hunters and families all bring their

own tents and supplies. They live in
com iron and hired cooks prepare meals
for the entire party. All dine at one
large table. In the evening tamp fires are
lighted and the time is given over to songs
and stories.
At the first streak of dawn the camp is
astir and after breakfast the hunters and
dogs are off. The hunters number from
twenty to twenty-five, while about a dozen
hounds are used. The same number of
men and- dogs are left in camp as a re
serve, to be used in case the deer is hard to
run down.
Monday morning at daybreak the dogs
were started to work in the hills west of
camp overlooking Little Paradise Valley.
Three deer were started by Mr. Hageman,
and the pack was soon in hot chase. After
about four hours' hard work the buck was
brought down by Jesus Aceves. This was
the deer of the hunt. The animal was
dressed and loaded on a horse and a start
made for camp, where they received a
noisy and joyous welcome.
Tuesday morning the hunters, headed
by Vie Poncelet and Dave Buiraore, were
off in a northwesterly direction toward
the Almaden hills. Four bucks were
jumped up, and, the baying of the hounds
soon told that the chase was a hot one.
The first buck, a three - pronged
one, was killed by Ed Northam
of San Jose. Mr. Piatti also laid
claim to the deer, he and Northam
having fired at the same time. After ex
haustive arguments on both sides it was
conceded by all that the game was

next deer, a fine fat yearling. The shot
was a pretty one, being at a remarkably
long range. The third, a prime two-year
old buck, was brought down by George
Millais of Gilroy. The party then headed
for camp, with the splendid record of three
deer in one day.
The hills east of camp were worked
Wednesday morning and soon the dogs
were away after three deer. One was
chased right through the camp and caused
much consternation. The deer was badly
wounded and proceeded up the creek to a
ranch house, where the family drove off
the dogs and captured the game.
Thursday three deer were started in the
hills toward Almaden.
This mornine (Sunday) will be the prin
cipal chase of the hunt^ It is expected
that at least 150 hounds will be scouring
the hills in all directions* at sunrise. A
return to camp will be made at noon and
after a sumptuous dinner camp will be
broken.
Among those in camp daring the week
were the following: M. Rogers, Frank
Watkins and Mr. Can field of Los Angeles;
Mr. and Mrs. Dan M. Murphy, Arthur

Gilroy, Matt Americh, Al York and George
Griswold. These are only a few of those
who were present.
Tuesday afternoon Congressman Loud,
Game Warden John D. Mackenzie, Elmer
Rea and some fifteen others visited the
camp. They brought a load of water
melons, which were immensely enjoyed.
Wednesday Ira Hageman and Sam Bane
had a swimming match, the forme'

tbe latter on a horse. Hageman suc

the saddle.
The camp this year has been larger than
heretofore, the sport has been better than

and when camp is broken this afternoon
the party will separate with the firm de

A dispute having long subsisted in a
gentleman's family between the maid and
the coachman about fetching the milk for
breakfast, the gentleman called them
together before him that he might hear
what each had to say, and decide accord
ingly.
The maid pleaded that the coachman
was lounging about the kitchen the best
part of the morning, yet was so ill-natured
that he would not fetch the milk for her,
though he saw she had so much to do that
she had not a minute to spare.
The coachman said it was none of his
business.
"Very well," said the master; "what do
you call your business?"
"To take care of the horses, clean and
drive the coach."
"You say right," answered the master,
"and I db not expect you to do more than
I hired you for, so I order that every
morning before breakfast you get the
coacu ready and drive the maid to the
farmer's for the milk, and I hope you will
allow that to be part of your business."

The talk of red-hot rock from unknown
regions falling in Arizona recalled the fact
to W. M. de Witt that an aerolite is buried
in the middle of the road near the Woody
House, just east of Tulare. If we ever
knew this we had forgotten it and it may
be news to others. Mr. de Witt says it fell
about three years ago, his boys seeing it.
In its descent it scared a team and caused
a runaway. The thing was a good-sized
rock, like limestone or basalt, and buried
itself in the hard road. Some pieces were
taken home, and he fully intended to re
turn and dig up the whole heavenly vis
itor, but before he was ready to unearth
it, road graders came along and covered it
entirely. It is still there, no doubt, if
anybody wants it. â Tulare Register.

ment.
I have never told of mv connection with
the Earl of Gasket affair. In the first
place the details of the story wilt disclose
the discreditable part I plsjed. and in the
second I cannot say positively that 1 ever
saw the reai Earl of GaaKet. To all intents
and purposes I was myself the Earl of
Gasket while off the California coast, but
it my fellow-passenger was not the real
Eari then I was the counterfeit of a
shadow, and the mystery will only become
deeper by the publication of my experi
ence. So I have hesitated about writing it.
On the other land, the name and de
scription are so like rhe man I knew that
the matter could scarcely have been a
simple coincidence. And as for his disap
pearance from Babaquivera with the big
gold bar, it is quite natural that he should
hare decided to get into Mexico, and so
chose Ensenada as his destination, where
an English company wasoperating. There
he would have found congÂ«nial young
Englishmen as dissipated as himself.
Thence he would have decided to risk de
tection at San Francisco while embarking
on an Oriental steamer. Of course, I ad
mit the possibility that the young Earl
never left Arizona alive, but was waylaid
on his way from the mines with the gold,
and that his bones may now be lying on
the deseri, gnawed clean by coyotes. But
in that case who was my fellow-passenger,
and why did he personate the Earl?
No, after thinking thwmiatter over, I in
cline to the belief that the Earl went to
the dogs in Arizona, and finally in dis
gust decided to steal the gold bar in
trusted to him and use the proceeds to
carry him away, anywhereâ to Mexico,
China or India. If I remember rightly,
the papers suid the bar was worth $12,000.
That was enough to tempt even an. Earl,
especially if he were young and impe
cunious. It is probable that on the death
of the Duchess What's-her-nume, when
the London lawyers were looking over the
world to find the heir to her millions, that
young man, unconscious of his greater
wealth, was scattering the proceeds of the
Arizona gold bar in the lotus lands across
the Pacific. I have no doubt that be will
eventually turn up to claim his money.
It is to give the young devil his due that
I tell my story, and old newspaper men
will pardon me for emerging Irom the
decent and customary anonymity of the
craft to assist in solving the absorbing
questionâ Where Is the Earl of Gasket?
I am a newspaper man â Earl Gasket by
name. During one of the iate Central
American squabbles I was sent down as
special correspondent, mainly through a
special correspondent, mainly through a
villainous smattering of Spanish unfortu
nately picked up along the Rio Grande.
It is irrelevant and painful to dwell upon
my experiences in Central America. I
got out at> quickly as possible, and came
up along the coast, writing up special ar
ticles, and finally landed at Enseneda.
Tnere I awaited the steamer Triton, Cap
tain yon Rudder, en route from Mazatlan
to San Francisco.
Owing to "untoward circumstances,"
etc., I found I I ad barely enough money
left to buy a second-class ticket. I was
not sorry, however, to part with my last
"dobe" for the pasteboard that would take
me back to San Francisco, and I scanned
the list of my fellow-passengers with as
much Interest as if I were traveling on a
first-class pass. Among the names of the
Morenos, Rodriguezes, Fulnnos, Zutanos,
and all, I saw:
"The Earl of Gteket."
"Aha," said I, "the Gaskets travel to
gether. I shall cultivate his Grace."
The next afternoon the Triton's deep
wthistle was heard. The entire population
with one accord awoke from its siesta and
ran open-mouthed to the beach and
swarmed on the long wharf like ants. I
sent my trunk down on the back of a
stout iaisano and followed toon after.
The Triton was just making fast. Cap
tain yon Rudder, bluff and * bearded,
stood on the bridge bellowing out orders
in English, Spanish or German, and some
times mixing the thiee, as occasion
seemed to require. Dozens of Mexicans
jumped for the lines as they were heaved
ashore, while others ran for the gang
plank and cleared the way with a great
deal of noise for the uniformed captain of
the port, who majestically advanced, with
a few hangers-on, all calmly smoking
cigarettes. A fusillade of salutations had
begun between the crowd and their
friends on board, and the air was full of
'â¢Como te vÂ»s, Chicha? Ah, Pepe! que
tal de Mazatlan?"
Soon the lines were made fast and the
gangplank run out. Friends, men as well
as women, embraced and patted one an
other on the back. The sailors dealing in
odd shells and gulf pearla brought out
their wares, squawking parrots and green
pineapples obstructed the path, and the
puffing donkey engine began to disem
bowel the steamer of crates of panoche,
barrels of tequila and big bunches of plan
tains.
The busy steward and his flunkies
bustled the passengers ashore and began
to stow away the newcomers for San
Francisco. My porter stood by and
pointed to me when addressed by the
steward, who consulted his list and read
the name, "Earl Gasket," on my trunk.
"Right this way, Mr. â vm â that is â
cr â your Majesty," said the steward,
fawning before me. "Billy, bring the
Earl's trunk into No. 17. Not so luxuriant
as you are used to, of course," added the
steward, turning to me, "but the best
stateroom we've got on the ship. Will
you come this way, vm â urn?"
The steward led the way, quivering
with excitement, and stopped one of his
boys. "Go and tell the old man," he said
in a stage whisper, "that the Earl ol
Gaslcet has comeâ quick 1"
Tho boy started, stared at me as he
would at a ghost and making a wary
detour around me darted dov/n the com
panionway.
My first impulse was to explain. I
would call a halt. But before I knew it an
intoxicating warmth of spirit possessed
me and I was exhilarated by a sense of
temporary importance. "Your majesty !"
What nonsense I thought, and yet it
tickled me immensely. I did not then
realize as I do now that iv common with
most Americans I had a sneaking awe of
title, and was willing to be identified with
an earl even through a blunder, as more
than one of my countrywomen have been.
"I'Jl just go a cad," I thought, "and
see how it ends. It can be explained when
the Earl comes. Besides, there is my
trunk, and it behooves, a traveler to keep
his baggage in sight. It wiil give me a
sight to become acquainted with the Earl,
too, and maybe he cac furnish a story."
So I invented excuses while the steward
led me to No. 17. Evidently he had been
studying also, for he proceeded without
hesitation to address me as "your majesty"
as if satianed that he had found the proper
title.
"Have a cup of coffee, your Majesty â or
praps something else?''
"Well, yes, something else," I said.
"And I say, my dear fellow, if Captain
yonâ yon Tiller â yon Helm "
As I spoke the doorway was darkened,
and the captain's huge bulk appeared.
"Yon Rudder," he roared out, as though
I were a ship's length distant. "Yon
Rudder; is this the Earl of Gasket? Veil,"
he continued, before I could explain, and
crushing my hand in his, "Earl, I am
wery happy to meet you. Bienwenida,
eh? Hope you vill make yourself com
fortable; just time to shake hands; Billy,
tell Mr. Johnson to blow the vhistle; I'm
behind, I must make it up between here
and San Franci.-co, already; and a big
cargo for Ensenada, too; mucho negocio,
eh? Carambas!"
The hearty captain wiped his brow, and
I essayed to explain. Surely this is going
too far, I thought. Before I could speak
he resumed:
"Veil, Earl, just make yourself to home.
Mr. Vilkins, the purser, told me that you
got two staterooms to make sure of one.
Good!"
The steward, with the un rring instinct
of his race, stood waiting with two
glasses. As we raised them to our lips the
deafening whistle sounded, and we indi
cated our mutual esteem by a flourish.
Cantain yon Rudder hastily drank, waved
his hand and was gone.
I would fain have explainedâ
Bang! bang! bang! "All ashore not
going in the ship!" Bang ! bang ! bang !
"Adios, amiguitol"
"Adios, adios!"
"Let go the bow-line, Mr. Johnson I"
The confusion of tongues, thumping of
baggage, scuffling of feet and puffing en
gines were enlivening sounds. I went
outside and saw the '..u-'tle of departure â
the embrace; of the Morenos and Fulanos,
the fluttering of papers, the scurrying of

the crew in casting off lines, piling up
baggage and hauling up the plank.
At the last moment, in the very nick of
time, before the Triton swung off, a little
man came sauntering down the wharf,
carrying a small black satchel and clasp
ing a black Drier between his teeth. He
looked around for the gangplank, found
it drawn up and without hesitation begau
to clamber down one of the piles, keeping
a tight grip on the bag and awkwardly
stepping from spike to spike driven in the
pile. A flunky ran up and told him to
throw down the bag, but the little man
made no reply. The ship bad begun to
move. Captain yon Rudder was exasper
ated.
"Veil, veil, manyana vill do! Don't be
in a hurry!" he bellowed in ponderous
sarcasm.
The newcomer turned to see from
whence came the sudaen criticism, lost his
hold and fell upon the rail in a heap. The
flunky grasped him and pulled him to a
place of safety. And now, as I remember,
the fellow never lost his grip on the hand
bag and the pipe. As he stood up and
brushed himself I noticed that his beard
was of a peculiar copper color and English
in cut.
"The steward was right â 'the Earl of
Gasket has came,' " thought I.
He stood for a moment and glanced
quizzically up to Captain yon Rudder, on
the bridge, while the latter uttered a few
remarks with a point to them like the
point of a bludgeon. Tnen he weut aft.
I remained on deck and saw the little
town and the long wharf fade in the dis
tance and the dusk. "Adios," I said,wav
ing my hand to Mexico and all Central
America â "Adios 1 I came to you as a
newspaper man and I leave you as an
Earl!"
I had grown reckless, perhaps. But I
felt that my time for explaining had
passed. Let the other fellow explain.
Going boldiy to the stateroom set apart
for his Grace, I made myself at home as
the captain had requested. The fawning
steward appeared, and asked if his Ma
jesty would preter to take dinner pri
vately. It was a good suggestion, and I
adopted it. In a twinkling the dinner
was before me â a most appetizing meal.
Captain yon Rudder came in, alter having
given onlers to the helmsman to steer
"nort'vest, half nort," and to "hook her
on."
As we chatted I heard the parser ap
proaching, calling for tcketi. "My time
is short," I thought, but 1 managed to
preserve a calm exterior. I had deter
mined, since my time for explanations
had passed, to "run a cold bluff," as I
once heard a. man of pleasant manners re
mark.
"Earl, this is Mr. Vilkins, the purser,"
said Captain van Rudder. "Mr. Vilkins,
the Earl of Gasket."
"How do you do, urn-urn?" mumbled
the purser. "Quite a mix-up somehow,
man out here says he's the only Earl on
board. Says be lost bis ticket. List says
Earl of Gasket, first-class, and Earl Gas
ket, second-class. Suppose you engaged
both rooms, urn-urn? Suppose he'd a
bilk?"
"No. Mr. Wilkins," I replied coolly; "I
fancy the list is correct. As I remember,
I have beard an Earl Gasket mentioned â
THE EARL OF GASKET "HAS CAME"
a writer, you know â a newspaperman, if I
mistake not. These fellows are dcv lish
shrewd, though really why he should at
tempt to pose as the Earl of Gasket is more
than I can understand."
'Oh," interrupted Captain yon Rudder,
"you don't know these newspaper fellers.
They are the biggest nuisance you ever
saw. I tell you, Earl, you never know vat
thpy vill do next, especially these Ban
Francisco fellers, vhich I consider the
vorst of the United States. One time vhen
I just came out of La Paz "
Here the captain related a startling in
stance of the satanic clairvoyance and pro
digious staying qualities of a reporter,
which entertained me nu re than he knew.
I busied myself in finding my ticket,
wbich I presented tn Mr. Wilkins.
"Hello! 'Earl Gasketâ second class!'"
he cried.
I assumed what I bopad was an attitude
of surprise. "You don't mean it, really ?"
T said. "H'mâ deucedly awkward of that
Gasket person, don't yon know? It can't
be that he has the first-class ticket?"
"That's it!" bellowed the captain.
"Ho-ho! Narrow escape, eh? Vhat did
I told you about these newspaper fellers?"
"No," said the purser; "he has no
ticket This is his."
"V#H, veil! this nonsense must be
stopped," said Captain yon Rudder, with
sudden sternness. "Mr. Vilkins, let's go
and see that man."
They went out, and I casually followed
as soon as prudent. Directing my steps
by the roar of the captain's yoice, I was
led into the saloon, where a crowd had
gathered around.
There, in the center of the group, sat the
meek little Earl of Gasicet, the handbag
lying on the table between his out
stretched arms. He was loosing over his
pipe at the captain and the purser with
an expression of blank amazement in his
eyes.
"I never before had occasion to doubt
my identity," he was saying.
"Give him his own ticket, Mr. Vilkins,
said the captain. "Now, Gasket, I
don't vant you to try any more funny
business on this woyage â eh? You can't
fool me. I have seen you in Ensenada.
Nobody can forget vhiskers like yours is,
already."
Poor little Earl! He tried to hide his
confusion by again searching for the
missing ticket. He did not look in the
handbag, I noticed, but kept one hand
near it constantly. His search was fruit
less, and finally, to escape the battery of
eyr-s, he arose and left the saloon.
There was no excuse for my meannesi
and dishonesty in not disclosing the true
state of affairs. I was strongly impelled
to tell the captain the truth, but-
Well, I returned and occupied the first
class cabin.
The next morning, instead of restoring
to the Earl his rights at once, I conceived
a plan to continue masquerading in Dor
rowed glory. It was a miserable subter
fuge, but, I am ashamed to say, 1 thought
at the time it was rather clever.
"We are now on the high seas," I
thought. "We had reached the three-mile
limit, surely, before I gave the nurser to
understand that 1 was the Earl of Gasket.
Why not enjoy myself until almost to
Frisco, and then return the title to the
Earl while still on the high seas? The
title would be none the worse for wear.
Certainly there is no international law," I
thought, "covering this point. There is
no precedent to follow. My act hardly
comes under the head of piracy or forcible
entry and detainer or any of those high
crimes. At the worst, it is simply an
acquiescence in a fortuitous situation."
I arose, breakfasted and went out on
deck. There, by the rail, stood the Earl,
gazing off toward the dim California coast
and smoking his inevitable brier. On a
sudden impulse I resolved to speak to
him.
"This is your first visit to California, is
it not, Mr. Gasket?" I remarked, with an
assumption of ease.
"Under the circumstance*, yes," he re
plied quietly, and glancing curiously at
me. If I mistake not tnere was a twinkle
in his eye.
"Great country," said I. '
"Intensely so," said the Earl.
"One meets with queer adventures."
"Deucedly queer."
"Of course," I persisted, "regarding the
present adventure I am no more at fault
than yourself. I was not allowed to ex
plain."
"No explanation is necessary," said the
Eerl, hastily. "So far as lam concerned
the present arrangement is quite satisfac
tory â quite so. The novÂ«lty â vm â quite
delightful, I assure you. Bit of a romance
for my book on America, don't you know.
Quite delighted."
The deuce 1 thought L Why so â¢ud
denly delighted ? "Very well," I said, "I
shall abdicate whenever you like."
"Very good, very good," replied the
Earl.
So we parted the best of friend*.
As we neared the Golden Gate, however,
the old blustering winds began to blow,
and my careless dream began to fade in
the light of the realities of the life I was
again approaching. "After all," I
thought, "a beat is belter than borrowed
glory, and I would rather run a scoop than
reign in a lazy land. The Earl can have
his title back. I will get into the whirl of
newspaper work. No more Spanish Amer
ica for me."
When the opportunity presented itself
I broached the subject to Captain yon
Kudder. "Captain," 1 said, "you remem
ber telling me that the ways of newspaper
men were peculiar. You will, no doubt,
be more confirmed than ever in your
opinion when you learn that I am not the
Earl of Gasket at all. I am plain Earl
Gasket, a newspaper man, and the little
Englishman with the copper-colored beard
is the real Earl."
"He is, ehf" said the captain, evidently
not receiving my statement as true.
"Yes, he is entitled to this stateroom
and lam not. The whole thing happened
through a very curious mistake. As he
made no fuss about it I let matters, take
their course. But as we are nearing San
Francisco I thought it best to tell you. I
have no desire to play the part any
lon er."
But no, the captain would not believe
me. He regarded it as a joke, the point
of wbich had not become apparent to him.
Then I produced my baggage and
showed him letters from the managing
editor and instructions regarding my
work down the coast. I recalled points
about San Francisco that nobody but a
resident would know as a witness that I
was not an English Earl. The captain
said the case was very strange and finally
gave me to understand, in a half-hearted
manner, that he credited my story. He
occasionally glanced shrewdly at me,
however, as if suspecting me of some
stratagem.
Afterward I saw him and the Earl talk
ing, and the Earl was shaking his head
vigorously. I wondered if Captain yon
Raider was asking whether or not my
story was true.
The captain was more reserved during
the rest of the trip, and indeed paid no
attention to me. We drew swiftly Into
the harbor and approached the pier.
The first persons, as usuaj, to come on
board were the customs officers in uniform.
They were accompanied, however, by a
man in citizen's dress, with whom I soon
afterward became quite well acquainted.
Captain yon Rudder advanced and snook

hands with the officers, Mr. WHkins did
likewise, and while the impatient passen
gers fretted and fumed the officers deliber
ately looked over all the papers and finally
pronounced them good.
The word to go ashore was given and
the Morenos and Fulanos and their tribal
connections were soon engaged in a turbu
lent stream on the wharf. I prepared to
leave the ship, when I saw the civilian
approach Captain yon Rudder, say a few
words, and show him a paper. Captain
yon Rudder turned and pointed toward
me, saying, "There's your man."
They advanced to me, and the man said :
â¢â¢I have a warrant for the arrest of the
Earl of Gasket."
"Well," said I, "why don't you serve it?"
"Here it is, sir," said the man. "Will
you come along with me?"
"But you've got the wrong liasket," I
replied. "I am not the Earl. The man
you want is a little fellow with close
cropped, copper-colored whiskers, always
smoking a pipe â "
"Veil, veil," broke in Captain yon Rudr
der, "this is the Earl of Gasket, if you
want him. You fellers are pretty sleek
already," he added, turning to me.
There was no necessity for a* scene. I
knew I could clear tbe matter up quickly
enough by going to tbe police station and
sending for my chief. I smelled a first
rate story, too, and looked over the crowd
to see if the Earl was in sight. As I ex
pected, he was not.
"Come on," I said.
The man kindly allowed me time enough
to clear my baggage and 1 brought it with
me to the station. On the way the man
said he was a detective and bad the auda
city to ask if I did not think it was rather
a good job catching ma.
"No, I think it is the most blundering
piece of work I ever saw," I said. "Toe
Earl of Gasket has walked away from
under your nose."
Tbe man laughed at what he considered
my chagrin.
At police headquarters they told me
what I was wanted for and treated me
with great respect as the biggest crook
they had captured in many a day. I rather
enjoyed the distinction for a time and sub
sequent inquiry revealed the fact that the
Earl of Gasket had improved that shining
hour.
When my chief came, in response 10 my
note, he cleared me in the twinkling of an
eye and I had the satisfaction of overhear
ing the officer in command as* him to
Keep the story out of the papers. It would
give the department a black eye, be said.
I shoolc hands with my late captor and
said: "Yes, sir, it's the most blundering
piece of work I ever saw."
I don't know what steps the officers took
to find the Earl of GaÂ»ket. I learned
afterward, however, that the trans-Pacific
steamer City of Singapore had sailed an
hour or so after our arrival, and I thought
perhaps tbe Earl had gone on her. His
name was not on the list, however, and
when she returned I asked the purser if
anybody had taken passage after tbe list
had closed. He could not say. The stew
ard saiJ there was a man, small, quiet,
with peculiar copper-colored whiskers,
but, he thought, an American.
That's all I know about it, and that's
why I, like Fosdyk & Fosdyk of Lon
don, want to know several thinga. One of
the first questions is, "Where is the Earl
of Gasket?" Iba E. Bennett.
THE PROSPECT MUST BRIGHTER
JKe Outlook for Boys at the Present Time
as VieWed by OliVe Heyden.
I shouldn't like to be a boy just now,
with my life and its work before me. I
shouldn't know what to choose, or how to
go about it after I had chosen.
These times are sadly out of joint and
great must be the change now struggling
for birth.
Truly the problem before a girl is as
difficult, but girls have been used since the
ages began to face uncomiortable situa
tions, and in this generation they have
seen such an opening of doors and drop
ping of bars that they are fairly running
riot in their new freedom to labor &t what
they will.
The first use the human animal makes
of liberty is to abuse it, then to learn a
new lesson from the results of that abuse,
and by hurling against the wall on one
side and then on the other, to at last settle
into the happy medium.
So, while our sisters are passing through
thiÃ transition period they may fairly
claim consideration and time to prove
themselves worthy of the honors awaiting
them.
But boysâ now, it is a pretty hard world
for them, and will be until several prob
lems work themselves out, with or with
out great convulsions.
Things are so dreadfully crowded. The
boy thinks of the work he likes, and then
he sees men, strong, experienced men,
leaving that occupation for anything they
can nnd to 00, and ne tuinKS "a is useless
to learn it if there is no room for more
workers."
Then he looks about, and finds, with a
shock, that all the common avenues of la
bor are crowded with hungry-eyed men,
who understand that the present "job"
stands, a frail barrier, between them and
charity, chance or starvation. He sees a
new and even larger army of boys coming
on to claim a place in the ranks already
crowded and overcrowded, and can you
wonder if sometimes his energy and am
bition relax, and he does any work which
will bring him in money, without much
regard to the honor or dishonor of it?
It is a queer feeling, and one very pow
erful to change a stiff backbone to gela
tinous condition, the feeling that there is
no place for one in the world. It doesn't
conduce to good citizenship at all. A boy
feels something not akin to love for the
country which claims him, yet refuses
h'm a place and opportunity to labor.
The result of the present Presidential
campaign will, I believe, neither end nor
perpetuate these conditions. The roots
lie too deep to be disturbed by such a tem
pest. The situation is as wide as the cir
cumference of the earth, and a reform as
broad as that must come before things are
finally straightened out.
A very funny argument is that which
says there are too many people in the
world, and suffering must reduce the num
ber. The United States is not nearly full
to the brim, yet, in comparison with some
countries more thickly settled the condi
tion of the people has been more rapidly
growing worse.
The place for advancement seems to be
in the learned professions and the occupa
tions that require higher education. Edu
cation is freer than it used to be, and at
the same time it is not so free.
True, a boy may be educated with a
smaller outlay than was possible a genera
tion or two ago, but fewer, far fewer, of
the fathers of the middle-class are able to
afford that outlay.
Higher education is most decidedly not
free. A colleee training costs much. The
free tuition makes no one perfectly free to
take it. Coll6ee education must, to be of
any value, be taken after a boy is old
enough to work. Then his time is money.
While the boy needs his days for study
some one needs his days for dollars.
Sometimes in a boy's after life he feels
a Bense of injury in that he lacks some
thing a higher education might (or might
not) have given him. It matters not
what his work is, the need of education
makes itself felt, and with it comes a feel
ing of resentment toward somebody or
something.
It is nonsense to say that only certain
occupations need any general education.
I know it has been most satisfactorily
proven by argument, but the mechanic,
the clerk, the farmer, yes, even the laborer,
continues to feel, if he does not say, "I
need to know more."
A man will sweep a streetithe better for
baying had a general training. It will
make him discontented with his labor, to
be sure, which is the first step toward ele
vating him to something higher.
I have often, constrained by the affec
tion I bear for the whole varied race of
boys, thought of the other problem which
confronts them on the threshold of life.
Can it have a \rholesome effect on the
character of a boy, on his honesty and his
honor, to know he must have u a pull" to
get a place?
It is no great incentive to industry or lo
faithfulness to know that they count for
one, while influence counts for nine. The
days when we carried our letters of recom
mendation in our faces Â«nd our habits,
like boys in books, have gone entirely, it
would eeetu.
This prevails most in cities, but the dis
ease spreads rapidly* Not more than ten
years agj, when a city teacher asked me
how I secured my desirable position in a
country school, I answered simply: "I
grew up in the 'town, and they knew I
could do the work." The city teacher an
swered, doubtingly: "If you have found
Acadia you had better stay there. The
rest of the world asks not of your ability,
but of your 'pull.' "
Now, in that same Acadia I see from
afar the gathering strength of influence
and the growing weakness of simple abil
ity and fitness.
The lives of men who began as very poor
boys and died the possessors, or, more
truly, the leavers, of millions are held up
before the boy of to-day, and he is told to
go and do likewise.
In the first place, he cannot do it in this
generation as he could have done one, two
or three generations agoâ by pluck, de
termination and industry. The condi-
longer a new one to be grown up with.
While cities were springing up like
strong vines in the June sun some, more
bold and tactful, might have been car
ried up with them ; while great railroads
were building, new lands being opened
and rich mines being discovered there
were chances, good and bad, for the young
man venturesome enough to grasp them.
Tnat time is past. Our boys must make
up their minds to leave little to chance,
and they soon find out themselves how
little they can depend upon opportunity.
The day laborer must be in with some
one to get an opportunity to exchange ten
hours hard labor for a dollar. The very
street gamin must know "de push" to gain
permission from some vague potentate to
sell papers on the corner.
The lad who wishes to learn a trade goes
not simply and in person to apply lor an
apprenticeship. He knows well, young
as he is, how quickly the door will shut in
his dirty, eager face.
He uses his little wits to put one and
one together where they will make two.
He thinks of all the men he knows, or his
father knows, and figures out which of
them best know the "boss" of the shop he
wishes to enter, and then he begins to pull
wires like the embryo rascal he has to be.
Once in a house or shop his promotion
depends in a small measure upon his
work and in a large measure upon who
he is.
That this condition is general is proved
by the query which meets the news of the
employment of any one. Try it Tell
your friends that some mutual acquaint
ance has secured a position in any house,
and see if they do not, one and all, ask,
"How did he get in?"
In public offices a pull is seemingly a
matter of course.
The ingenious typewriting girls, who
admitted they expected four times as
much pay for doing City work, were tak
ing a lesson from their brother nian.
The brain-workers, too, are partly handi
capped by the increasing difficulty in
gaining a livelihood. It cramps genius or
perverts it to know that it must be con
verted into money right now, or the spark
of inspiration will die ior want of bread.
There is something most vitalJy wrong
with a time when men must struggle so
hard to make a living that they have
neither time nor energy to make a life.
The weird, sensual and short-lived liter
ature of the day is the result of he same
pressure. We must write what will sell.
The two extremes, the shaggy, gloomy,
law-bating anarchist, and the slender, ef
feminate man of fashion are results.
They did not make themselves.
Boys live, and will continue to live, even
in worse conditions, but life isn't very
satisfactory just now. Things will right
in time, perhaps, and time to come may
counteract tbe effects of the present.
It is wrong to point to the failures of
this time as present failures. They are
failures of the past. The stream of wrong
living has bÂ«en flowing down to us througo.
other lives and broadenine as it flowed.
It is no great honor to be a boy now
adays, and no bed of ease. The tenderest
consideration and sympathy is only jus
tice for boys who fail; the highest respect
and honor is only the just due of those
I who honestly succeed, hcvever humbly.
Olive Heydek.THE REAL BOHEMIA
IN SAN FRANCISCO
Disciples of Raps the Qreat
WKo BoW to tke OWI
"Lulu."
This is the mysterious cry of recogni
tion of the members of the Schlaraffia.
"Aha, Ihi, Uhu."
These are the names of the gods before
whose shrines all good SchlaraSen bow,
and the greatest of these is Aha, the wise
and solemn-looking Dird which rules
Bohemia o'er all the world.
Within Bohemia's charmed and blithe
some realm there dwells a little coterie of
congenial spirits whose quiet, enjoyable
and unostentatious doings have hitherto
remained entirely unknown to the folks of
ordinary grain and fiber in this City.
Everything pertaining to this exclusive
organization is flavored with a peculiarity
and a secrecy that eive it extreme
piquancy to the unitiated.
It is known as the Schlaraffia, and its
members are all Germans, or those who
are able to converse in the language of the
Fatherland. Entrance to the domain of
the gods of pleasure and genius, who are
the ruling spirits of the society, is made
contingent, not upon the wealth or social
position of the applicant, but upon his in
dividual ability to render assistance in the
task of speeding the fiaeting hours by
lading them with pleasure. Membership
is confined to actor, artist, poet, sculp
tor, author, musician and those who fol
low any of tbe muses who are presumed
to contribute to the pleasures of the
human race.
It was a generation ago that the order
of the Schlaraffia took its origin in the
city ol Prague, Bohemia. Its date of birth
is down in its sacred records as October 10,
1559. The apparently ancient date is due
to the whimsical fiction adopted of
carrying on the proceedings of the
various societies of the organiza
tion in conformity with the days
of 300 years ago. Everything in use by
the members, their ceremonies, the desig
nation of the months, the ranks of officers
and members, all bear names that would
be unrecognizable to the German versed
only in the modern Teutonic etymology.
Its inception was due to the disfavor
with which the artist of the stage was
then looked upon by the higher classes of
society in Germany and Austria, and
actors were the orieinators of the unique
RARE STORIES FROM THE CITY HALL.
Failed to Naturalize.
There is one employe of the Sheriff's
office whose name, if the final letter was
removed, would rhyme with brace, who
will be careful to have j.t all understood
beforehand the next time that to odige a
friend he undertakes to see him safely
ttirough the intricacies of becoming
naturalized.
A Swedish acquaintance came to him
when the Superior Judges were busy turn
ing out hundreds of citizens per day and
announced that he wanted to vote at the
coming election, but had not gone through
the fina! steps of naturalization.
"That's all right," said the municipal
employe, "and I suppose you believe in
free siiver?"
"I suppose so â guess so," was the vague
answer and the satisfied deputy hunted up
another Swedish friend and introduced
the pair, and without explaining much of
the process of naturalization to either
bundled them into Judge Sanderson's
court and by his authority as a Sheriff's
deputy procured an early audience.
Being on terms with the legal luminary
he supposed, of course, that be would be
called upon first to answer to the qualifica
tions of his friend and began :
"Judge, this is a friend "
Then Judge Sanderson suddenly turned
to the other witness, who was waiting
silently for the deputy to answer the mo
mentous questions so that he would know
what to say when called upon.
"How long have you known this man?"
he asked.
"I know him not long, Judge. My
frinnd here introduced us toeedder."
A withering glance from the bench told
the deputy that his friend would not vot
for free silver or anything else at this elec
tion and he hastily mad* his exit amid
the laughter of the other prospective
voters.
"Yon have too big a heart," they observed.
She laughed. v\.;.-. : â  : J>

institution. It was not long before the
renown of the Prague club spread, and
admission to its precincts was sought by
the very people who had forced the
founders, as a measure of revenge, into
the movement. But the club was in
exorable in the rule laid down for eligi
bility. No initiation was charged and the
dues were simply the amount necessary
to carry on the meetings. While rank
and wealth in themselves were not pro
scribed, the prime requisite was the
ability to contribute some intellectual or
artistic dish to the menu of the "feast of
reason and the flow of soul."
Soon brandies were instituted in various
cities of the Continent, and in 1883 its in
fluence had spread to this City, where a
local club was organized, largely through
the efforts of A. J. Kahler, the well-known
newspaper artist, who had at one time
been a member of the mother club. San
Francisco, in fact, bears the distinction of
having organized the first Sciilaraffia club
in the United States, though there are to
day similar societies in New York, Brook
lyn, Chicago, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, St.
Louis and Philadelphia, and one is about
to be organized in San Jose. Altogether
there are now nearly 120 clubs scattered
throughout the world and all rendering
allegiance to the "Mutter," or chief or
ganization, at Prague.
The meetings of the local Schlaraffen
are held every Thursday evening in their
hall on Bush street, on one of the floors
above Norman's. This apartment is dec
orated in a manner to at once attract the
notice of any casual visitor who may be
fortunate enough to gain access to it.
Scarcely an inch of the wall is left blank,
the mural adornment consisting of the
works of the members, but more particu
larly of the artist constituents. Most of
the paintings and designs are freaks, but
with a strong element of the artistic and
poetic in them nevertheless.
At each meeting diversion is offered in
the shape of an original poem, an essay, a
painting, a bit of work in clay or marble,
the rendition of a musical composition,
declamation and even short histrionic
displays. All visiting German actors re
j new their allegiance to the owl, the chief
deity of the Schlaraffen, when they come
It Was Arabic.
Lots of funny things come into the office
of the Board of Health in the way of birth
certificates made out in foreign languages,
applications for mil* permits written in
impossible hands, etc., but, as a general
thing, through experience and knowledge
of many different tongues, the secretary
manages to set them right, and see that
they are properly entered in the record.
The other day, nowever, he struck a
poser, and it is still a poser. The mail
brought a birth certificate blank on which
there were but two words that the secre
tary could made out. The first was in the
line beginning "Name of child," which
was filled out "Mary." The other was the
name of the physician or midwife, which
was plainly E. Schneid.
The other lines, in which the date of
birth, name of father, should have been
given, were filled with queer-looking
hooks, querls and curved lines with occa
sional dots. Mr. Godchaux scratched his
head and looked puzzled.
"Some idiot has written this certificate
in shorthand," he said.. "Here, Mrs.
Sichel" â turning to the obliging sten
ographer of the officeâ "just translate
this."
The certificate certainly did look like
shorthand, but Mrs. Sichel made no more
progress than the secretary. Occasionally
she struck something which might have
been a phonetic character, but it would
not fit with anything else.
"I give it up," she finally announced.
"ferhaps it is some system that you are
not familiar with," said Mr. Godchaux,
and he was about to send the certificate to
the stenographer of some other depart
ment, when a friend, learned in ancient
languages, came in and announced that
the queer-looking marks were Arabic.
The inquiry stopped right there.
Sheâ You may say what you will, I think

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1896.
to this City, and these occasions partake
generally of more than the usual gayety.
Not an infrequent occurrence at these
gatherings is a duel over some imagined
offense. The gauntlet is thrown down to
the alleged offender, who promptly ac
cepts the challenge. The character of the
combat is then decided by the Ober
Schlaraffe. It may be of the material or
the intellectual. If of the former, each
principal selects three seconds. Six
glasses of beer are then placed upon a
table, three for each group of seconds.
The principals, after tasting the contents
of each glass, hands one to each of his
seconds, and the latter must drain them
to the last drop. The side which con
cludes the task with the greater expedi
tion is declared the victor, Should one
drop be spilled defeat falls to the knight
on whose side the faux pas has been made.
More Interesting, however, is the in
tellectual contest. When the Ober Schla
raffe pronounces his fiat that the battle
is to be of the mind the combatants retire
to the seclusion of their studios and there
concoct the poem, song, canvas or piece
of sculpture that is intended to bring them
victory and honor. The verdict is ren
dered by the presiding Schlaraffe. The
productions of both knights become the
property of the club, and the victor is
presented with a medal as an award of
merit.
There are three Ober ScbJaraffen elected
for each club. One attends to all inside
affairs, another to outside business and
the third looks after the artistic side of
the organization.
Emil Meyer, R. Fenner and C. Herr
mann are the reigning Schlaraffen of the
local club, and among its prominent
and active members are Otto Dobbertin,
the sculptor; Ernest A. Otto, the artist;
John H. Sievers and others prominent in
professional and artistic circles.
"In Arte Voluptas" is the motto of the
Schlaraffen, and diligently do they seek
pleasure in art, and unselfishly do they
provide entertainment for visiting
brethren, come they whence and when
they may. Occasionally the wives and
daughters of members are admitted to the
mysteries of the "sippung" or meeting,
and also strangers. But all non-members
must be vouched for by the member who
introduces them, for who enters here must
take an iron-bound pledge of secrecy.
Each initiated Schlaraffe bears an in
signia of his affiliation, but this is minute
in size and its significance is not to be be
trayed to any outsider. Unless one is a
member of the select circle the secret
badge of Bohemianism would probably
never be discerned, though usually worn
in plain sight.
Though caste is eliminated from this
brotherhood of pleasure-seekers, rank is a
feature. There are the grafen, the ritter,
the junker, the knappen and the proba
tioners. Strangers who are permitted to
pass the sacred portals of the "burg," or
meeting place, are known as "pilger."
An act of disobedience or disloyalty is
punished by confinement in the jail of the
"burg," generally a particular corner of
the apartment, and the prisoner is de
prived for a fixed period of his usual al
lowance of beer and other inspiriting
liquid refreshment.
For tbe past rifteen years the order has
had its own official organ, published in
Prague under the sanction and super
vision of the mother club. Herein are
printed the effusions of the literary mem
bers and they are.of more than ordinary
merit. Recently this publication, which .
bears the name of the organization it rep
resents, celebrated the issuance of its two
hundredth number by a specially hand
some edition, with a unique poster design
on the cover in colors. None but members
are allowed to become subscribers to this
journal, nor are the unamliated permitted
to peruse it.
Raps the Great is the most notable
fisurs in the history of the Schlaraffia.
He was one of the early Ober-Scblaraffen
of the mother society and did more by bis
individual efforts to bring the organiza
tion to its present and past state of popu
larity than any other dignitary of the
Bohemian band. His wit was of the keen
est and always ready to flash. While he
reigned there was no dull moment pos
sible during the sippung. Monotony was
his abomination, and his inventive genius
evolved new ideas as rapidly as the occa
sion required. His name to the every-day
acquaintance was John Eichler, and he
followed the calling of a sugar- broker.

His Right Jiar\d.
Justice of the Peace Cook has one odd
habit that comes into play while he is in
terpreting and carrying into effect the law
in his court that puzzles many whose
business calls them into bis tribunal, and
was the cause of an amount of amuse
ment the other day that somewhat ruf
fled the dignity of his Honor.
There is a time-honored custom that
demands that oaths in a court of justice
must be administered with the right hand
raised. Of course, there is nothing in the
law that compels this, and an oath would
be legal even though neither hand was up
raised, but the custom is so old that most
people are not aware of this, ana to swear
without tbe right hand up appears queer.
The witness-chair in Justice Cook's
court is on the left of the Judge's bench,
and his Honor seldom takes the trouble to
turn to use his right hand, but raises the
left when giving the formula of tbe oath.
"Raise your right hand to be sworn," he
said to & witness in a case that was tried a
few days ago.
Apparently the man did not know which
was his right, for he looked at the Justice
to see which of his hands was up and then
raised his left.
"Raise your right hand," said the Jus
tice a second time.
"I have," said the witness, and the law
yers and other witnesses began to laugh
audibly.
Justice Cook utilized his right hand to
hammer vigorously with his gavel for
order, and then again admonished the
witness to raise the other hand. By this
time the witness was badly rattled, the
courtroom was convulsed and the Justice
was growing very impatient at the pro
ceedings.
"Never mind," he said testily, "keep
both hands down if you can't tell your left
from your right â it makes little difference
anyway. 'Do you solemnly swear, etc.,'
and the case proceeded without further
hitch.
We wish we could look as wise as a plumber
looks when be pounds a pipe to discover a

THE OLDEN DREAM
OF THE ALCHEMIST
jiath Emmerxs the Secret of
Turning Silver Into Qold ?
Dr. Stephen H. Emmens, the inventor
of the powerful explosive known as "Em
mensite," having recently announced that
he has discovered a method by which
silver can be changed into gold, the very
large number of metallurgists and
chemists who on the Pacific Coast deal
with the production of the precious metals
are on the gui vive and they will wait witli
much of interest and curiosity more
definite announcements than have been
made public The utterances of i)r. Em
mens may be summarized, for readier
understanding, about as follows:
Neither gold nor silver is an elemental
body. The relations of the two metals
chemically to each other, and their con
stant association in nature, has long made
it probable that they are but different
forms of tbe same substance, just as
charcoal and the diamond are allo
tropic forms of carbon. It is possi
ble to dissolve cold very easily, and
the resultant solutions of both gold
and silver are the same; a substance has
been secured by segregating the particles
of the silver solution which is similar
to gold. Dr. Emmens has found that the
transmutation of silver into gold has a
commercial value. He produced artificial
diamonds from a carbon solution thirty
years ago, and has constantly worked
since that time on the problem of the di
visibility of what are called elementary
substances. A laboratory will be erected
in New York to carry on the transmuta
tion of silver into gold according to his
process.
Local metallurgists and chemists have
been interviewed. John W. Pack, assayer
in the United States Mint in this City,
said that it is true, as Dr. Emmens claims,
that gold is not an elementary substance.
Demonstration has amply proved that
gold is a compound substance and con
tains two elements. This being so â and
the chemists have claimed such to be the
fact â it is possible that such a discovery
may lead up to solving the solution of
gold as we know it now. "At the same
time," said Mr. Pack, "before I am will
ing to say that silver can be transmuted
into gold, or to think that a process has
been discovered which can accomplish
that result, 1 must see something more
definite than has yet appeared on the sub
ject. In other words, I would like a
demonstration.
"Dr. Emmens is probably misquoted
concerning the ease with which gold can
be dissolved. It cannot be dissolved as
easily as sugar is dissolved by water, but
by the use of muriatic and nitric acids it
can be liquefied, as it has been custom
arily turned by chemists into a liquid
form. But while silver can be dissolved
by one acid, nitric acid, it takes two
acids to dissolve gold. Of course all
metallurgists must surely realize the
wide bearing of a discovery by
which the transmutation of the less
valuable precious metal into gold can be
effected, and scientific men will undoubt
edly watch what may come of Dr.
Emmens' experiments by reason of the
economic bearing of his researches fully
as much as on account of their purely
scientific possibilities." Mr. Pack has
been assayer of the mint some years, was
four years assistant assayer at the mint
under Mr. Twiggs and has had intimate
knowledge of metallurgy since 1874.
Louis Falkenau conceded that it is pos
sible that silver may be transmuted into
gold. Modern chemists, proceeding scien
tifically, have reached the conclusion that
this may be accomplished, and Dr. Em
mens may be the discoverer of the process.
Mr. Falkenau did not say that he thought
that such a discovery had been made.
In reference to the article which appeared
in The Call last Sunday Mr. Falkenau
said:
"What was published may be all true.
At any rate the writer had some knowl
edge of his subject and he has the advan
tage that no one can dispute him success
fully. No one knows that what he says is
not true. It has been hoped for, centuries
that the baser metals might be trans
muted into gold. The olden alchemists
believed that this was possible. The mod
ern scientists have arrived at the same
conclusion, but by entirely different pro
cesses and investigations have the mod
erns come to that way of thinking. The
Spoiled the "Snap."
When telephones are mentioned in the
office of the justice clerk there are quite
likely to be dark looks cast at George Mc-
Comb, the genial deputy clerk, the most
of whose spare moments these days are
spent in listenine to tbe arguments of
those of his friends who areu rging him to
make a fight for the nomination for Re
corder. Generally no information regard
ing these glances and the accompanying
pantomimes suggestive of severe breath
ings can be elicited, but in a burst of con
fidence the other day one of hig fellow
deputies told the cause.
"We had a snap on telephone messages, "
he said, "until George got into a row with
Central the other day and spoiled the
whole thing. This is the only nickel-in
the-slot telephone in the City Hall, and we
spent the price of many steams sending
messages to our friends until we struck a
great scheme. We found that by sharply
striking the button that drops the nickel
into tbe box and sets the buzzer going as
notice to Central that the company had
collected its tariff the same result could be
attained as though the nickel was paid.
That was a genuine good thing, and we
worKed it for all it was worth. Even our
best friends were let in on the snap, and
they traveled blocks to use our 'phone.
"One day George thumped the button and
waited for Central to do the rest, but there
was a hitch somewhere, and in spite of
the fact that he had contributed nothing
to the support of the corporation he got
impatient.
"He banged the hook for a while and
when Central answered said:
" 'Say, Central, this machine is on the
blink.'
"'What's the matter?' asked Central.
" 'That's what I want to know,' said
George. '1 guess she must be out of or
der.'
"He got his call and thought no more of
the matter. The next day a repairer came
from the telephone office, took out our
soft snap and put in one that can't be
fooled into deceiving Central. No more
free messages."
field has been gone over so carefully that
when the discovery comes the final and
critical step will probably be the result of
an accident.
"At the same time it should be said in
that connection that accidents of that sort
are becoming daily less probable as knowl
edge of properties steadily advances. I
have the works of Cary Lea of Philadel
phia, who is alleged in the article in The
Call to have made a discovery which Dr.
Emmens says is the key to the problem of
the relation of silver to gold. I am sorry
that I have not now at hand some samples
which have been sent out by Cary Lea as
the result of his experiments. I had
some, but they have been mislaid.
Others on the Pacific Coast have received
samples from Mr. Lea. The work of Mr.
Lea is interesting, but I know very little
of his standing as a chemist. Under cer
tain conditions silver may be made to
look like gold. Frankiy I may say that I
doubt whether Dr. Emmens can turn sil
ver into gold, and 1 believe such an ac
complishment as that a long way offâ but
I do not know."
LoVers
Of the Bull-Figkt
In view of the difference of opinion re
garding the brutality of bull fightine it is
interesting to learn that there are no more
enthusiastic patrons of the plaza toro in
Mexico thau the Americans.
North of the Rio Grande it goes with
out saying that the National sport of
Mexico is barbarous, the goading of a bull
into fine furies for the insensate pleasures
of a mob, the danger and excitement and
blood are of a dead and gone age. And
the climax itself, the death of the tortured
animal, being demanded as part of tbe
He Qot the Morgue.
The deputies out at the Sheriff's office
are a lively lot of young fellows, full of
animal spirits, and they like nothiDg bet
ter than a practical joke. The latest
amusement maker was invented by Billy
Shean and many a laugh it has furnished
the deputies between attachments.
Billy went to the telephone the other
day and asked Central for a number.
When the preliminary hello announced
that an answer could be expected, he
asked :
"Is that you. Smith?"
"No," came over the wire.
"Well, who is it?" asked Shean.
'â¢The Morgue," was the answer.
Billy was about to use some vigorous
language when a thought struck him.
Why not put some one else in connection
with the Morgue and have a laugh at the
victim's expense?
Just then Head Keeper Van Derveer
came in and was greeted with, "Say, Van,
a lady wants you at the telephone. Call
up 1947."
The unsuspecting keeper entered the
box where the 'phone is kept for privacy's
sake, and Shean hastily gathered all the
available deputies outside to await devel
opments. This is what they heard:
"Hello, Central, give me 1947.'
"This is Mr. Van Derveer. Who wants
me?"
"The Morgue! What the devil do I
want with the Morgue?"
Apparently the man at the other end
was also a little bit hot, for the receiver
went up with a bang and the victim came
out witu a red face to meet a circle of
smiling deputies and a loud guffaw. Van
Derveer was able to say, "There are
others," before the office closed for the
day.
"I thought you were never going to speak to
Harold again as long as you lived," said one
girl.
"I know I said so," replied the other. "It
wasn't my fault that I broke tne resolution."
"How did it happen?"
"He called me up over the telephone."â
Washington Evening Star.
proper performance, bespeaks the brute
nature.
This is one view, however. South of
the Rio Grande there is a sentiment which
shudders at the thought of two men en
tering a ring and fighting and pummel
ling each other until one falls fainting,
overcome by a succession of terrific
blows and its attendant weakness.
Perhaps, as these fights too frequently
terminate, one of the combatants falls,
never to rise again. And this the votary
of bull-fighting holds to be infinitely more
debasing and more cruel than the mere
pastime of killing cattie.
In Mexican cities where there is a large
proportion of American residents it is cus
tomary to spend the Sunday afternoon in
the bull ring and to yell with the rest as
the sport waxes warm and exciting. In
deed, the American and European dwell
ers in the sunny republic are counted
among the best patrons of the ring, and
nowadays it is a common sight to see long
trains crowded with people from Texan
cities pouring into Mexico of a Sunday
afternoon, the objective point being some
town where a bullfight is to be held. On
such occasions the towns on the American
side of the frontier are actually emptied of
their population. "Where are the peo
ple?" you may ask.
"Oh, over in Mexico ata bullfight," some
old woman or youngster wiil be sure to
answer.
As an illustration of the growing infatu
ation among Americans for the bullfight,
the city of Monterey, in the State of Nuevo
Leon, Mexico, is cited. There the Ameri
can and European population is about
25,000, including the mining and refining
districts immediately around the place.

There is a dog on Folsom street that a
surpasses al) other dogs in the vicinity in
discernment, if not in all around intelli
gence. Blame he is called, and is owned
by nobody knows who. He is a spaniel,
with a large intermixture of Newfound
land, and is noted particularly for his
vocal performances at night. He will sit
for hours upon an unoccupied stoop and
howl without cessation from dewy eve
till morn. What interests the whole
neighborhood in Blame is the fact, that
has been observed any number of times,
of his seeming to know the exact
purpose of the pound-catchers, who peram-
bulate Folsom street very frequently.
Whenever Blame observes the fated wagon
he gives a prolonged howl and then starts
up the street barking as if possessed, and
every dog when he hears Blame's peculiar
racket immediately makes himself scarce
and hides, and until the poundkeeper is
gone cannot be induced to become visible
again. So sure are the people that disas
ter threatens their pets when Blame
comes dashing down the street that there
is a simultaneous rush to the doors and a
search for the family dog. Blame is abso
lutely infallible as a danger signal and
owes his iivine to tbe bones which his
beneficent services have earned from grate
ful dog-owners.

Gilroy Hot Springs.

under the auspices of a committee consisting
of Gregory Valerro, OUie Morosco W C
Leavitt, E. M. Peters, William Kruse Georee
Bunker, M. B. Aloraghan, J. c. Nolan and
others. A warm debate on the questions of
the day, between A. C. Berthier of San Fran
cisco and Hon. John Hunter of Gilroy was
listened to by a large crowd, including the
many guests at the hotel and many leading
citizens from the surrounding towns.
The grounds were finely decorated with
flags and bunting ana illuminated by hun
dreds of flaming torches. Prior to the debate
William Kruse, in a few well-chosen words,
expressed himself on the issues of the day and
introduced the speakers of the evening.
After two hours of warm arguments the
genial proprietor of the Gilroy Hot Springs
took the platform, and in an address of wel

SANTA MONICA,
Elaborate Preparations for the
Southern Tennis Tour
nament.
Tne eleventh annual tournament oi th 6
Southern California Lawn Tennis Association
which commences at Santa Monica, Cal., Mon
day, August 24, at 2 o'clock, will undoubtedly
be one of the most interesting of the associa
tion tournaments.
The events will be all comers' singles, all
comers' doubles, mixed doubles and ladies'
singles. The time for the closing of entries in
the all comers' singles has been fixed for Mon
day at 2 p.m., with play commencing imme
diately thereafter. The other events will be
posted from time to time on the association
bulletin boards.
The tournament will be played on the courts
of the Casino, which have been completely
overhauled and repaired, the one immediately
in front of the grand stand being entirely re
laid with cement and made the finest couA
in the State by long odds, so the experts claim
who have seen it.
Almost every town In Southern California
from Santa Barbara to the southern line will
De represented with especially strong dele
gatious from Riverside, Pasadena, Los Angeles
and Santa Monica.
The sectional rivalry has already become in
tense, with Pasadena backing Messrs. Pitcher
and Freeman, Los Angeles Art (BumilUsr, the
present champion, Mr. Welcolm and A. C.
Way. Santa Barbara has W. Alexander to be
proud of and Santa Monica Messrs. D. D. Acker
and W. E. Lester, who says he is going to win
one of the cups for charming iittie Miss Lester.
It looks like a close race in the all comers'
singles between Pitcher, Freeman, Alexander
and Le6ter as to who will endeavor to wrest
the championship from the well-known Stan
ford athlete, Art Bumiller. Whoever he will
be, he will have to play a remarkably good
game to defeat the champion, for not only is
he the quintessence of agility and grace, but
.the personification of coolness, level-headed ness
and boasts exceeding accuracy. He plays a
strong net game, with ability to head off lob
bing tactics.
In the doubles Pitcher and Freeman, who
have won the cups twice and will have to de
fend them this time again, will undoubtedly
have strong opposition. If they succeed the
cups become ihelr personal property.
In the ladies' singles Miss Marion Jones, the
charming daughter of Senator J. P. Jones, who
last year carried away the State champion
ship and has twice won it in succession in the
South, will In all probability win it again.
However, if Miss Grace Gilfiland of Riverside
enters the event it will make a match between
the ladies worth a journey from the Golden
Gate to witness. They both play a strong,
graceful ame, have command of a superb
net game and altogetherplay tennis of a high
order of merit.
Miss Barlow-Massacsof England, who Is visit
ing her sister, Mrs. Pedley, who is summering
at Santa Monica, has the reputation of being a
good tennis player and will probably compete
with the others mentioned.
In the mixed doubles Mrs. W. E. Lester and
Miss Marion Jones are looked upon as probable
winners.
There will be at least thirty players contest
ing with prouably ten additional by com
mencement of play.
A grand ball will be the chief social feature
of the tournament.

BBANCH-743 and 744 Market StreoWMcKINLEY'S FIRST
GREAT SPEECH,
A Talk on the Tariff in the
Fiftieth Congress That
Won Him Fame.
COURTESY TO RANDALL.
Conduct That Won for the Ohio
Statesman the Respect of
Democrats.
CAPTURED THE GALLEEIES.
Keen Wit, Spontaneous Good Nature
and a Perfect Mastery of
Details-
The Washington correspondent of the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat devotes a letter
to McKinley's first great speech on the
tariff. The story told in the following is
just now of peculiar interest to both Dem
ocrats and Republicans:
William McKinley's first leap into Na
tional fame as one of the country's fore
most orators was an achievement that
will never be forgotten by those who wit
nessed it, and his triumph on that day
was all the more memorable and remark
able then and all the more interesting to
recall now from the fact that it was asso
ciated with an exciting little episode that
won for him the warm good-will not only
of all Republicans but of large numbers of
conservative Democrats of the old school.
Unlike William J. Bryan's recent oratori
cal exploit at Chicago, by which he cap
tured the Presidential nomination, Mc-
Kinley's speech was not a clever piece of
verbal clap-trapâ an ingeniously contrived
use of ammunition already spent â a
patchwork of blasphemous phrases and
sensational sentences already published
and paraded; but it was an original, solid
and sustained effort of two hours' dura
tion upon a subject to which he had de
voted long attentionâ -an effort which he
has since equaled and an effort whose suc
cess he has since more than justified.
The occasion was eight years ago, back
in the Fiftieth Congress, when the tariff
measure then known as the Mills bill, now
a mere historical reminiscence, was under
discussion in the House of Representa
tives, of which McKinley was a member.
It was on one of the last days of the gen
eral debate on the bill and tbe red-letter
date was May 18, 1888. fcx-Speaker Samuel
J. Randall, the heroic old-school Democrat
of Pennsylvania, with McKinley and the
silver-tongued Breckinridge of Kentucky,
occupied the lists in summing up the ar
guments of that great forensic struggle, to
be followed next day by Speaker Carlisle
and Thomas B. Reed of Maine for the
Democratic and Republican sides, respect
ively.
By special arrangement ex-Speaker Ran
dalJ was to occupy the first hour of the tilt
on that field day and McKinley and Breck
inridge 4vere to consume jointly the re
mainder of the time; and in order to effect
this and to concede to Randall even the
inadequate hearing of one hour â he being
at odds with the managers of bis own
par ty â it was agreed that the House should
meet at 10 o'clock that morning.
Randall accordingly appeared promptly
at the appointod hour, in readiness to
address the House, and Springer of Illi
nois was in the chair. But, unfortunately,
a vigorous "Independent" Congressman
named A. R. Anderson, from lowa, had
secured the floor on the precciing even
ing, and when the House met at 10 o'clock
he insisted on his technical right to con
tinue. So, while the overflowing galleries
in a high pitch of expectation fidgeted
restlessly on account of the interpolation,
Anderson reeled off a long free-trade com
position with unintelligible speed, occupy
ing the whole hour that had been allotted
to Randall.
At 11 o'clock, however, Randall arose
and, taking a position near the front row
of the Democratic side, addressed the as
sembly. Notwithstanding he had been a
notable figure in Congress for a quarter of
a century and had won and wielded un
disputed leadership in the Democratic
party, he had been "read out" of it for
refusing to reverse his life - long tariff
views upon the peremptory demand of the
new free-trade managers. Standing up
almost solitary and alone in defense of
the traditional protectionist tenets of old
line Democracy, and physically weak and
ill unto death of the malady that after
ward laid him low, he heroically ex
pounded the non - partisan doctrine of
American protection, and, like an inspired
prophet in his old age, warned his erring
party associates of the folly of abandoning
good economic principles for bad.
His face paled visibly as he began, read
ing from manuscript, and his hands trem
bled as he held the .leaves. His progress
â¢was painful, but his audience was im
pressed by the simple grandeur of the*sit
uation, and his own marvelous will power
sustained him.
He briefly alluded to the recognized
necessity of a tariff revision and the prom
ises of bis party to that end, and pro
ceeded to explain the provisions of the
"Kandall tariff bill," which he with ma
ture knowledge bad prepared and intro
duced, to demonstrate that a tariff revision
fulfilling the party promises and remedy
ine existing abuses could be accomplished
upon Democratic lines and at the same
time wreak injury to no American indus
try. After adverting to the Mills bill in a
general way, he next proceeded to analyze
the blunders in it, showing that it left
dutiable many so-called raw materials^
while placing on the free list articles made
from them, thus not only erecting an in
surmountable barrier against the produc
tion of such articles here, but actually pro
tecting the foreigner against us, aud im
posing burdens upon ourselves for tbe for
eigner's benefit.
He poiuted out, too, that while the bill's
supporters claimed to be the peculiar
friends of the farmer, tney took from him
his protective duties on wool, hemp, flax,
meats, milk, fruits, vegetables and seeds,
and while professing to give the manu
facturer better rates, deprived him of his
protective duties. And instead of remov
ing taxes from necessaries md imposing
them upou luxuries, the bill gave free
olive oil to thÂ«Â» epicure and taxed castor
oil 97 per cent; gave free tin-plate to the
great oil and meat-canning monopolies,
and imposed a duty of 100 per cent upon
rice; gave the sugar trust free bone black
lor cheaper manufacture, and levied a pro
hibitory duty on grocery sugar; imposed
40 per cent duty upon -the "poor man's
blanket," ana only 30 per cent upon the
Axruinster carpet of the rich; and finally
made free the blooded horses of the gentle
men of the turf and the fine paintings and
statuary of the railway millionaire and
"coal baron."
At this point, bis allotted hour having
expired, ihe Speaker a3Ked for a slight ex
tension of time; but Chairman Roger Q.
Mills of Texas, then head ,of the Ways
and Means Committee, who had naturally
been writhing in irritation under this
eearchiDg analysis of the measure bearing
his name, and whose piaus as leader of
the House in control of the debate would
necessarily De interfered with and disar
ranged by any extension of Randall's
time, sprang down the able and angrily

interposed his veto. With flushed face he
shouted, "I object."
Cries of "Oh, no !" and "That's too bad !"
went up from all parts of the chamber.
Still Mills stood inexorable, despite the
expostulations of his nearest colleagues
and friends. The whole Republican side
and many members of the Democratic side
shouted, "Shame!" â but to no purpose.
Then everybody got up and moved toward
the open space in front of the Speaker's
platform. A fight was imminent, and the
entire assembly was in confusion.
Suddenly, amid the din and uproar, a
clear, musical, vibrant voice rang out,
"Mr. Chairman !" and Major McKinley,
with beaming eyes and face lighted up
with the glow of a generous purpose, was
seen making his way into the central
arena from the Republican side.
"Mr. Chairman, said he "I believe I
am to be recognized next after the gentle
man from Pennsylvania. I yield him fif
teen minutes of my time."
A burst of delighted applause greeted
this magnanimous offer. Meanwhile Ran
dall, once the active and all-powerful com
moner, already sick and now upset by the
nervous strain, remained standing in dis
tress in the midst of the gathering storm,
begging poor permission to go on. Now
he paused, and, bowing, said with simple
dignity, "I appreciate the gentleman's
kindness."
Simultaneously Breckinridge, on the
Democratic side, with cnivalric intention,
essayed to make a statement and submit
an offer of muiual adjustment. But the
House was angry and wouldn't hear him.
It was supposed he wanted to justify or
palliate the interference of Mills, who had
now been led to the rear by his friends.
Cries of "Regular order!" went up from
all sides, and little "Sunset" Cox, who
had enjoyed a special indulgence of tima
the day before, ran in nimbly, shouting:
"I think it is only decorous and kind
that the time of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania be extended."
At leneth BrecJtinridge, despite many
exclamations of impatience from the
House, contrived to be heard, and poured
oil upon the troubled waters by explain
ing the special arrangement governing the
allotment of time ami proposing that Ran
dall yield back the extension granted him
by McKinley and freely take instead such
time as he needed, on the understanding
that it should be deducted equally from
the time allotted to McKinley and himself.
Thereupon the House and galleries
quieted down, and the unconquerable
.Pennsylvania leader was suffered to con
clude without further interruption. Breck
inridge's handsome proposal had averted
an ugly quarrel thai might have led to tbe
most serious results, and it bad been made
to hi j own disadvantage and detriment,
since by giving away some of his time the
delivery of his own speech was delayed
until the end of the afternoon, wheD the
jrallenes grew restless and wearied and
gave him less attention than he would
otherwise have received. Still the popu
lar honors were accorded to McKinley.
His manner was so charming and pra
cious, and the offer itself was so gallant
and natural â ao appreciative of the pro
prieties and finer amenities, and so preg
nant with the spirit of good will and
manly fairness â that all the spectators,
Republicans and Democrats alike, felt
their hearts quicken involuntarily with a
warm thrill of personal admiration for
him.
Then McKinley took the floor in his
own right to sum up the debate for the
Republican side, and tbe House and the
galleries settled down to listen. It seemed
Ins generous conduct of a few minutes be
fore in the Mills-Randall incident had
somehow enabled him as a runner to start
out on the right foot, as it were, and had
empowered him as an orator to rise to a
height of eloquence and reach a goal
that he would not otherwise have at
tained.
His conduct had certainly captivated
the House and galleries, had brought
them into close and sympathetic rapport
with him, and had served to invest his ut
terances with added interest aud enhance
the whole general effect. At all events it
endeared him to old-line Democrats as
nothing else could have done, and he has
never made, before or since, a more superb
address, at least in quality of delivery, aud

nomic subject so interesting and enjoy
i able in every way has been heard in Uon
gress with like rapt attention since the
days of Henry Clay, commanding as it did
the unstinted commendation of both
friends and foes.
It was by far the liveliest and most viva
cious of all the serious speeches of that
long debate, and though no better in some
respects than a number of the tariff
speeches he has delivered since, it never*
theless had about it all the glowing fresh
ness of a new mind and the zealous ardor
of a new champion. It was particularly
characterized by an unlimited and spon
taneous good natu.e, a keen wit, an abso
iute eraspof the general subject and a per
fect mastery of all its subordinate details.
His bearing, carriage and delivery were
inimitable; dignihed, but easy; familiar,
but elevated : thoroughly earnest, but car
rying proof from personal conviction, and
withal so amiable as to win all his audi
tors. His style, too, was clearness and
straightforwardness exemplified and so
direct and simple that no effort was
required to follow him through the chang
ing phases of his theme. He displayed to
perfection that happy faculty for which he
has since become famous, of clothing with
magnetic charm of life the cold, practical
facts of economic philosophy and experi
ence. His voice was sweet, resonant and
musical as a bell, perfectly audible in the
remotest corners of the chamber. He
ennobled, clarified and illuminated his
subject and the existing situation as he
traversed them, and when he closed, amid
a rapturous whirlwind of plaudits, he had
manifestly sprung into the very first rank
of Republican orators and exponents of
protection.
His auditors had fallen in love with dim
as the country has done since. Millions
of copies of that speech were circulated by
the Republican committees during the en
suing campaign and it contributed not a
little to the successful election of Presi
dent Harrison in November following.
Previously, it is true, McKinley had ren
dered efficient and creditable service to
his party and country in Congress and had
earned high esteem among his fellow-leg
islators by reason of his marked ability
and lovable personal character. But he
had not risen into universal public celeb
rity and bis name was but little known
outside of his own State of Ohio and the
halls of Congress.
By that single, well-earned triumph on
that field day, May 18, 1888, the name of
McKinley oecanie a household word all
over the land. His admirable behavior
two months afterward at the Chicago Na
tional Republican Convention, his leader
ship in the next Congress, the fifty-first,
and his brilliant management of the tariff
bill that bore his name and won for him
(a matter to be proud of) the enmity of all
Europe, together with his steady and con
tinuous rise and advancement since then,
have all followed from that^triumph in
logical sequence.

A correspondent desires short and concise
directions for the management and play of
trumps. Short and concise directions cannot
be given.
It would be about as easy to give short and
concise instructions in chemistry and then re
quite a student to make a complicated
analysis.
The best players watch the developments
with care and play trumps according to the
situation.
A poor player often handles his cards so that
he would have mad 3 more tricks had he had
fewer trumps, and situations often arise where,
in the hands of players entirely great, the long
suit cards are mightier than the trumps.
As an instance of judgment and playing to
the situation, the following play of De Vie is
given. He held seven clubs, including the
four highest, and the king and two of trumps.
His remaining cards were two small ones of
each of the other suits. His partner opened
the hand with the ace of trumps, on which he
played the king. He afterward gave as a rea
son that the probabilities were in favor of his
partner playing from A. Q, J, and others,
rather than from ace with seven in suit. If he
was correct, he was certain of tnree rounds of
trumps, if he did not block the suit, and could
show his strength by his discards. As a result
of the play of the king he gained four tricks.
Now, to show how some players blindly fol
low a precedent or rule we quote the following
from the St. Paul Globe:
"The Whist Editor sat opposite a bright and
ambitious young player, who had read of the
De Vie play mentioned above. The editor
had the lead after the first two tricks had
been played, an established suit in his part
ner's hand, strength in the other suits in his
own hand, snd a threatened cross ruff seemed
to require the lead of the ace of trumps from
ace and two small; the aforesaid brignt and
ambitious young player promptly dropped the
king from king and one small; the result was
disastrous."
Study the situatious as they arise. Do not
call for trumps simply because you have
great trump strength, nor hesitate to call with
oniy moderate strength or even weakness, if
the situation demands it.
Do not play like an automaton, waiting for
four trumps, two honors, or five trumps, one
honor, before you lead them, simply because
the books say so.
The subject Is too extensive for our space.
We can only reiterate our instructions to use
your best judgment in determining what to do,
and do not be discouraged lf in the exercise of
your judgment you lose tricks at first. Prac
tice and observation will make you proficient.
BOLUTION TO PROBLEM NO. 12.
Twelve solutions were received to our prob
lem published August 2.
Some of them were correct as far as they
went, and many made it possible for North and
Bouth'to win all the tricks by plajUng the East
and West hand poorly. The solution as given
by the author, Mr. WhitfieM, is astollows:
North leads two of his trumps. To the first
trump South discards the 6of clubs. The rest
of the play depends on the discards of East
and West It should be noticed that East can
not discard two diamonds, since in that case
West would have to play the jack on
the third round of the suit, leaving South
with the best. East must therefore unguard
clubs or hearts. It i& obviously disadvantage
ous for him to unguard two suits. Therefore
the cases in which he discards one diamond
and one club or one diamond and one heart
need not be considered. Also in the cases
in which East and West unguard the
SHIPPERS COULD SAVE.

WHISTLETB.
The Oakland Whist Club has filed a chal
lenge for the Rideout trophy, but the time for
the play has not yet been set.
The local whist clubs are planning tor an in
teresting winter campaign. The San Francisco
Club has already announced its general pro
gramme, which provides for three nights' play
each week, with prizes for the highest scores
on one of the play nights, the players being
handicapped; separate monthly prizes for the
players making the greatest number of points
above the average in each month and a gen
commerce of the port. Prior to 1870 San Fran
cisco was already a great seaport and the main
distributing point on the Pacific Coast. The
advent of six transcontinental railroads has
resulted in the diversion of much of its in
terior trade, and our merchants at last recog
nize that it must make its future as a seaport,
for as a railroad center it is at the back door of
the continent. So at last we face the ocean,
and look over it, the world's cheapest highway
ral entertainment night, with'refreshments,
at the close of the month.
The Trist Club has not yet announced its
programme, but the committee in charge say
that it will provide some interesting features
for the entertainment ot its members.
The San Francisco Club defeated the Vallejo
Whist Club in the game for the Rideout trophy
last week, thus retaining the cup.
We owe an apology to Mr. E. C. Brown of
Oakland for omitting to give him credit for
sending us a correct solution to our problem
No. 6.
The Brooklyn Eagle has the following ar
ticle upon a system of play which permits a
player to oe fairly classed: The method here
tofore adopted for recording the weekly pro
gressive games, which are the principal events
in all the large whist clubs, has never been en
tirely satisfactory and a better plan is greatly
needed. In Brooklyn the practice has been to
Keep a record of each player's gains and losses
in tricks each week until the end of the fiscal
year, which is about the middle of September.
No prizes have ever been offered for the best
scores. In Chicago the standing of the players
is determined not by the number of tricks
gained or lost, but by the average number of
tricks per game, dividing the players into
classes according to the number of games they
have played.
They class those who have participated in
twenty or more games together and those who
have played less than twenty and more than
ten times they put in another class. It is not
a fair comparison to put the score of one who
has played twenty-one times, for instance,
against one who has played thirty-six times in
the year, and, as the number of hands or deals
varies considerably at these weekly games,
this plan does not afford anything like a fair
test. E. T. Baker of the Brooklyn Whist Club
has suggested a plan which, if adopted by the
club next year, is calculated to increase and
maintain the attendance at these games at a
very hign point throughout the year and at
the same time prove a much more satisfactory
and reliable test of relative merit.
His scheme Is as follows: Let the club give
two prizes, first and second, to the two mem
bers who at the end of the year have the
highest average number of tricks per deal, ex
pressed decimally, nor one being eligible who
has not played at least 800 deals during the
year, sometimes a game consists of eighteen
deals, sometimes twenty-one, twenty-four, and
as many as thirty-nine deals have been played
in the evening, so that dividing the gains by
the number ol times played to arrive at an
average does not seem fair. In a game of base
ball each player is charged with the number
ot times he comes to the bat ; in billiards with
the number of innings; so in wbist he should
be charged with the number of opportunities
given him, or, in other words, the number of
deals he plays.

for the commerce that must make our com
mercial metropolis. It was the earJy recogni
tion of this fact, now self-evident, that nas
prompted my long and urgent advocacy of the
Nicaragua canal.
The innovation of steamships coming across
the Pacific to load cereal products for Europe
via Magellan Straits is a striking fact, espe
cially when they accept Â£1 6s to Â£1 8s sterliug
freight. There could be no more satisfactory
object lesson in favor of the canal, as the solu
tion which, more than anything else, will cre
ate renewed prosperity for our producers. The
greater part of their campaign propaganda
might far better be devoted to an insistence
on the prompt construction of the canal than
In the discussion of free silver. There are hon
est differences of opinion about free coinage of
the white metal, but no man interested in the
prosperity of our people and the National in
fluence of our country will question the great
necessity for the prompt construction of the
Nicaragua canal under the control of the
United States Government.
The main purpose of this article, necessarily
restricted by the scope of newspaper require
ments, is to prove the assertions above made
by actual facts, which cannot be controverted.
I have carefully estimated the saving on a
year's cereal crop of the Pacific Coast which
could be made by the use of such steamers as
are to-day loading our cereal products for Eu
rope via the Magellan Straits route. In so do
ing I have consulted parties with full knowl
edge of the estimates I present, and their cor
rectness can be fully relied upon. If not pre
sented in full detail it is because space does
not permit, but the estimates are open to any
one who desires to investigate and will call
upon me for them. Our producers and mer
chants are invited to examine carefully the
showing made herein:
Distances an Francisco to Liverpool via Magel
lan Straits, 13,494 knots; distance ban Francisco
to Liverpool via Nicaragua canal, 7627 knots;
distance saved, 5867.
Cargo steamship. 2500 tons register, carrying
4000 ions wheat: speed. 220 knots daily average:
coal consumption, 25 tons average quality coal:
ship coaling Â»t Coronel, Chile and Cape St. Vin
cent via Straits and at Atlantic port of Nicaragua
canal, San Juan del Norte; one day's delay al
lowed at each pori.
VIA MAGELLAN STRAITS.
Coal 63 days, wages, provisions, stores, insur
ance on vessel (value, 9150,000), curs/o insurance.
Interest on cost of shin for two months ai 5 per
cent, total $17,984 80. Interest on value of cargo
not considered, but if included would be reduced
one-half by using canal.
VIA NICARAGUA CANAL.
Coal 36 days, wages, provisions, stores, insur
ance on vessol, cargo insurance, Interest on co t
of ship for one month at 5 per cent per annum,
total, $7528 70: saving via canal, 910,455 30:
canal toll, same as Suez. SI 85 per ton register,
I 94625; net saving, 95830 30; equal to 91 45 per
ton.
The average Pacific Coast crop, including
wheat, barley, flour, mustard seed &nd other
grains, may "be sately placed at 800,000 short
tons annually, making a saving on cereals alone
of $1,600,000. The permanent use of steam, car
riers avoids the necessity for t>ackinz, as in
Atlantic practice; sacks cost at this time 90
cents per ton, again saving $720,000 per an
num, making a total saving on the cereal crops
of Pacific United States Coast for one year
$1,880,000. The ship's freight to Europe
amounts to $27,080; cost of voyage, $17,984;
profit of voyage, gross, $9096.
From this, however, must be deducted port
charges, stevedoring, light and tonnage
charges. With a higner freight the showing
for ship-owners will of course improve and
with higher freights the saving via canal
would also improve correspondingly.
This being an accurate statement of saving
via the canal on one year's cereal crop, im
agine the saving to be added thereto oti
canned, dried ana green fruits, lumber, ores,
borax, wines, brandy, wool, asphaltum and
the many other products yearly increasing in
quantity. I purposely avoid the inclusion of
freights westward. The saving between San
Francisco and Now York would be about ot.e
third more, corresponding with the increased
distance saved. It appears to me a reflection
on the intelligence of oar producers and our
citizens generally that with such a showiug as
the above the canal is not made a leading
issue of the political discussion now filling our
press. Why theorize on abstruse questions of
finance, and neglect the proposition which *p
peals so directly to our immediate in lerestsT
Why should not Mr. Bryan and Mr. McKiniey
be requested to expre-s themselves on this
great and beneficent work so necessary to our
prosperity? True, both political parties have
promised us the canal since and including the
Garfield campaign. Yearly increasing in im
portance, should we now ignore it?
The estimate here given being correct, shall
we not demand the canal, irrespective of
party, and as a condition precedent of either
free silver coinage or a gold standard?
Let me not be considered uuappreciative oi
the benefit of inland transportation. On the
contrary, it is as necessary to the prosperity of
this seaport as the port itself. And the canal
will never depreciate the value of any iniand
line of communication, either by rait or in
land rates. One will complement the other.
The railways, in the increasing short haul to
and from tidewater, will rapidly increase
their earnings. The canal will enable our peo
ple to market the products of the coast r.ot
adapted to the more costly railroad traffic, and
in the increased population and prosperity of
the Pacific Coast Its railways will be the first
to feel its beneficent effect. The most prosper
ous railroads in the United States are those
which are aided in transportion by water
routes. Their stock quotations afford the
proof of this fact. William L. Mebrt.

ELKCTION NOVEMBER 3. 1896.
Prosperity is surely coming.
There is no longer any uncertainty.
The party of the best wages is the party
of the best men.
The meeting at the Wigwam made the
Democratic wig warm.
Woman's suffrage means a double vote
on tbe side of home industry. .
In the voice of McKinley there is heard
the sound of reviving industry.
Every industry in California needs pro
tection, and Bryan threatens us with free
trade.
Don't let the excitement of the cam
paign lead you to neglect getting ready
for the State Fair.
The Republican party speaks for the
whole Nation land the Nation will speak
for Republicanism.
And the Democrats are now complain
ing that the Republican plan of campaign
educates too much.
The duty of every man is to make his
income equal to his expenditures and it is
the same with a nation.
If you wish to be in the company of
buoyant, joyous, sanguine men, attend
Republican mass-meetings.
A McKinley victory is now so well as
sured the iron and steel men are already
talking of opening their mills.
The Republican campaign is now fully
opened, but the only thing open on the
Democratic side is Bryan's mouth.
The true issue of the campaign is to pro
vide American goods for American homes
and American mills for American labor.
It is clearly evident that the rank and
file of the Republican army is under the
direct command of general enthusiasm.
Even amid the comforts of his home to
day tbe workingman will feel the pressure
of Democratic hard times and see the need
of voting lor prosperity.
The yoice that champions the welfare of
the people and the honor of the Nation
will ever be eloquent in the hearts as well
as in the ears of Americans.
The Wyoming Republicans have very
properly nominated a woman on their
electoral ticket, and of course she will
count as a mascot for McKinley.
Eastern people have reached the con
clusion that Bryan is not equal to his
reputation, and it will be remembered his
reputation in that section wasn't much.
Experienced political campaigners in
the East say that never before in their rec
ollection have there been such large audi
ences as this year thus early in the can
vass.
Senator Vest is reported to have said "a
good Democrat is one who votes the ticket
first and reads the platform afterward,"
but neither Vest nor any one else will say
that such a man is a good citizen.
The plea made at Saratoga by the Lord
Chief Justice of England for international
arbitration was well received by this coun
try and there is reason to believe a plea
for international bimetallism would be
equally well received in England.
There is comfort in prospect even for
Democrats. They can take part in the
Stockton frolic on Admission day, and as
soon as they pick themselves up after elec
tion they can have their due share in the
Thanksgiving rejoicing over the return of
protection and prosperity.
It will not be overlooked by the work
ingmen of California that all the work
ingmen of the Mississippi Valley are or
ganizing McKinley clubs and sending dele
gations to call on McKinley. They know
the man, they know he is iheir friend and
they are going to support him.
The threat of Democratic free trade par
alyzed American industry, reduced the
amount of wages paid out, pat a check on
the circulation of money, cut down the
profits of merchants, ruined the market
for farm products; and still Bryan and
his crowd have the nerve to ask the peo
ple for their votes.
The people know that the Republican
party will keep its pledge to promote an
international agreement for the free coin
age of silver; they know also that Demo
cratic campaign pledges are always broken
when the party gets into office, and it is
in accordance with that Knowledge they
will vote on election day.
THE TRUE LEADER.
The influence of the personal character
of leaders is one of the most important
factors in the making of history. The
course of events in every crisis is largely
determined by the confidence or lack of
confidence which men have in those
in authority over them. It is there
fore most vital to the welfare of the Re
public that the supreme executive should
be a man of well-tried character, one wnose
deeds are known to all, whose personal
influence is of a nature to steady and con
firm the resolution of the people in the
performance of great actions. With a
strong man at the head of affairs the
people never despair, but with a weak one
they lose half their energy in a crisis by
losing all their confidence in the ability of
the leader to deal with it with wisdom and
courage.
It cannot be questioned that the evils of
the past years of crisis and panic would
have been much less than they were had
Cleveland been able to retain tne con
fidence of the, people or even that of the
leaders of his own party in Congress.
When they began to distrust him con
fusion ensued at once, and every evil of
the time was augmented by the bungling
legislation of wrangling factious in the
Government. With the disasters result
ing from such leadership still in evidence
in every trade and in every home the
American people will need no argument
this year to convince them of the folly of
making an experiment with an untried
man in the Presidency. The leader who
cannot hold the support or retain the con
fidence of the best men of his own party
is certainly not the kind of man to whom
an intelligent people will intrust tne
delicate and difficult task of shifting the
basis of our monetary system from the
gold standard to bimetallism, fraught as
that task is with danger to every trade
and to every industry.
In every crisis of its history the Repub
lican party has been singularly fortunate in
finding exactly the right leader to hold
the confidence of the people in the work
before it. That good fortune is well illus
trated in the leadership of McKinley at
this juncture. His personal influence
growing out of his charatuter and bis
record as soldier and as statesman has had
the effect of arousing the ardor of Repub
licans and of drawing to the party a
mighty host of business men, wage
earners, war veterans and conservative
citizens of all classes from the ranks of
those who have been hitherto in opposition
to the party. This presages something
more than victory in November. It gives
assurance that when inaugurated as Presi
dent Mr. McKinley will have the support
of the people at large, of a strong majority
in Congress, and that every crisis which
arises in finance or trade will be met with
the prompt mastery of a united, harmoni
ous and resolute Government.

war that the Republican party has named
for the high office of President of the
United States. McKinley is not an acci
dent in politics whom the people are urged
to accept as an experiment in government.
A youthful volunteer in the war for the
Union, his record of public service con
nects us with the great days of Lincoln
and of Grant. Trained in legislation
during the reconstruction period, when
our finances, our trade and our tariffs were
reorganized, he was the associate of Blame
and Garneld and ConKling in that vast
work, and rose to a splendid eminence
among the younger leaders of the country.
He now stands forth the rightful leader at
this great juncture. The people trust in
him. They know that he will right the
evils of legislation and restore the pros
perity the Democrats have destroyed.
FOR HUMANITY'S GOOD.
The address of Lord Russell, Chief Jus
tice of England, before the American .Bar
Association at Saratoga Springs will no
doubt cause the nations to take along
step in the direction of providing ways
and means for adjudicating disputes and
disagreements between themselves by ar
bitration. The distinguished jurist so im-
pressed those who heard him and those
who have read his address with the im
portance of providing for arbitration in
all treaties between nations that only good
must come of it, the more so because the
suggestion comes from the judicial head
of not only one of the strongest military
nations, but of a nation that is always
equipped for war.
Lord Russell made a pronounced de
parture from the beaten path when he de
clared that the standard of right and jus
tice between nations should be ethical. The
doctrine that might makes right the
Chief Justice renounces and proclaims the
gospel of peace, and that he voices the sen
timent of the people of his own country
there is no reason to doubt. But it is as
he said. There might arise complications
which would justify war more than peace.
No nation could afford to accept peace at
the cost of its honor. A nation might
have an unrighteous cause thrust upon it
and then war for the right would be far
nobler than to accept the wrong for the
sake of peace:
War Is honorable
In those who do their native rights maintain;
In those whose swords an iron barrier are,
Between the lawless spoler and the weak:
But is, in those who draw the offensive blade
For added power or gain, sordid and despicable.
There is unmistakable significance in
this coming together of many of the lead
ing jurists and lawyers of the two English
speaking nations to declare to the world
that the highest duty of a nation, next to
giving ample protection to its own people
in the enjoyment of their rights, is to
avoid as far as possible complications
with other nations that would necessitate
war. Were these two English-speaking
nations numerically weak in population
or poor in purse, their demand for peace
ful arbitration instead of war in adjusting
differences between nations would be re
ceived with little consideration by the
other members of the family of nations,
but together the United States and the
United Kingdom may be said to control
the wealth, the commerce and the indus
tries of the world ; besides their people are,
generally speaking, far ahead of the other
peoples of the world in inventive genius,
in learning, in science, in art and in the
elevating influences of home life.
The English - speaking people of the
world are quicker than any other to resist
advances upon their personal liberty.
They set the pace, indeed, for humanity
everywhere to higher and truer conditions
of national and individual freedom. They
lead in civilization's advance upon lines
of human brotherhood and in those ways
of peace which spring from sincere devo
tion to the principles of right, justice and
personal liberty. Hence the influence of
the Saratoga Springs meeting for good
must reach far and wide, and the seed of
peace and prosperity for all humanity
there planted cannot help bearing fruit
that will ultimately gladden the heart of
mankind.
GOING TO PIECES.
â It is probably true as reported that
Hoke Smith has left Mr. Cleveland's
Cabinet. He could have done nothing
else and retained the respect of friend or
THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1896
foe. It is the unwritten law of politics
that no member of the President's Cabi
net has the right to remain in the official
family a moment after he disagrees with
his chief on any public question. The
President is responsible for the official as
well as the political conduct of his ad
visers, and no man of character would
want to remain in the Cabinet if he were
not in full sympathy with the administra
tion's aim and purpose in all things.
Mr. Smith has a perfect right to differ
with Mr. Cleveland upon any question,
but he could not remain in the Cabinet
and support a man who is vilifying his
chief on every occasion without compro
mising hia own dignity. It does not mat
ter Whether Mr. Smith is supporting
Bryan on principle or for his own political
advantage; the fact that he is advocating
the election of the Chicago nominee and
espousing a cause that President Cleve
land believes is antagonistic to the best
interests of the country makes it obliga
tory upon Mr. Smith to relieve the Presi
dent of such a handicap as his own pres
ence in the Cabinet would be. Rumor has
it that one or two other members of the
President's official family are likely to re
sign on account of political differences,
and they should make haste to do so if
they disagree with the man who made
them Cabinet officers.
A FEW TACTS.
Mr. Bryan may know all about the tricks
of oratory, but he knows nothing what
ever about the science of economics. In a
speech the other day he undertook to
prove that silver bullion would have a
market price of $1 29 an ounce if this coun
try declared for the free and unlimited
coinage of the white metal, independent
of other countries, and as a clincher he
said: "Any purchaser who stands ready to
take the entire supply of any given article
at a certain price can prevent that article
from falling below that price." How very
very little the man knows.
Certainly one might prevent the price
of an article going below a given point if
he would take all offerings at that price,
but what has that proposition to do with
the bullion price of silver under Bryan's
plan of opening the mints to the free and
unlimited coinage of silver? The words
"free and unlimited" mean that there is
no buyer for silver bullion at any fixed
price. They mean that the Government
must take anybody's silver bullion, coin it
into disks called dollars and return the
product to the owner without making any
charge for converting the bullion into
disks. The Government does not buy the
bullion, therefore it fixes no price upon it.
It would be a matter of no consequence to
the Government what the market price of
bullion was. It would simply act as the
machine of the owner of the bullion to
convert it into disks. Bryan's theory is
utterly worthless as an argument, that by
opening the mints the Government would
become a purchaser of all or any offerings
of bullion at a given price.
To be sure the disks that were made of
the bullion would be a legal tender for
debts in this country, but they would not
be a legal tender in current transactions,
nor would one be obliged to agree to take
them at some future time in liquidation
of a current contract. In fact, the owner
of the bullion would not be a whit better
off after he had it coined into dollars, ex
cept that he could pay his old debts with
it, and to that extent only â to the extent
of paying debts previously contracted â
would the free and unlimited coinage of
silver, independent of other nations, in
crease the volume of the Nation's metallic
money. Not a few believe that Bryan's
plan of free coinage would make the Gov
ernment a buyer of silver bullion at its
debt-paying value as coin, bat they are
mistaken. As we have said, the Govern
ment would be nothing more than a ma
chine to change the snape of silver from
bars into disks or dollars and make them a
legal tender for debts previously con
tracted.
The difference between Bryan's plan
and the Republican party's plan to open
the mints to silver is very great. The
plan of the latter is to have the commer
cial nations agree that silver shall be a
money metal; that It shall be coined upon
its own merit; that it shall be made ulti
mate as well as present redemption
money; that it shall be accepted in all in
ternational commercial transactions at its
face value; that it shall have nothing what
ever to do with gold except in so far as it is
necessary to determine the ratio of differ
ence in the market price per pound; that
it shall be a money metal as full and com
plete as gold, and that it shall be received
for coinage at the mints of all the com
mercial nations. Naturally that would
keep its bullion and coin value substan
tially the same, because there would be a
demand for the world's production for
coinage purposes, and, moreover, the vol
ume of the world's metallic money would
then be increased in an amount exactly
equal to the world's production of silver
and gold, less the amount that would be
required in the arts and sciences. That
is true bimetallism.
FIRST CATCH THE HARE.
"When his old comrades-in-arms called
upon him the other day Major McKinley
said: "I do not know what you think
about it, but I believe it is a good deal
better to open up the mills of the United
States to the labor of America than to
open up the mints of the United States to
the silver of the world."
Some of Bryan's organs are trying to
make it appear that Major McKinley
evaded the money question on that occa
sion because he is committed to the gold
standard and did not wish to expose his
opposition to silver to his old comrades.
If Bryan's organs are too obtuse to under
stand what Major McKinley meant, or are
too dishonest to give a fair interpretation
of his words, the fault is theirs, and it
would be time wasted to bother with them.
Major McKinley was not talking politics,
religion or ethics when he addressed his
old war companions. He merely sub
mitted a business proposition which calls
for an answer from the experience and ob
servation of business.
The question is, Is it better to open the
mills tuat labor may have employment,
or keep the mills closed and open the
mints to the free coinage of silver and not
give labor employment? Mr. Bryan says
it would be better to open the mints than
the mills, but he does not say how labor
woyjd be benefited by transforming the
silver of the world into American silver
dollars. Labor may be very stupid in Mr.
Bryan's estimation, but, nevertheless, it
caniiot get it through its head how any
silver or any other kind of dollars will
find lodgment in its pocket unless
it earns them. If Bryan knows of another
way labor would be obliged to him for the
information, for dollars are what American
labor is needing very much just now.
The idea prevails pretty generally in labor
circles that if wage-earners could get
plenty, of employment their wages would
be forthcoming on payday and in a very
satisfactory kind of money, too.
Major McKinley is harboring the same
idea that labor is, and hence he and labor
are of one accord on the proposition that
it is better to give labor an opportunity to
go to work and earn dollars tb&n to let it
loaf around a mint and see dollars turned
out by the bushel, but not one of which
would come labor's way. Hryar* seems to
have the idea that feasting the eyes of
labor upon bushels of new silver dollars
should satisfy the demands of labor's
stomach for food, but as Mr. Bryan does
not belong in the field of labor and has
bad no experience in feedine the stomach
through the eyes, he is not a good au
thority on the needs of labor.
Major McKinley is just as vehement in
bis demand for more silver dollars as Mr.
Bryan is, but he does not see how more
dollars are going to benefit labor unless
labor has a chance to exchange its services
for them, and hence it is that he demands
that the mills be opened first so that labor
may have plenty of opportunity to earn
dollars, and then increase the volume of
dollars just as much as laoor requires it to
be increased. Major MoKinley would
catch the hare before he cooked it, but
Bryan would first get ready to cook it and
then "trust to luck" for the hare to come
and jump into the pou

The Judge will go to Santa Barbara and re

THE LINE AND THE STAFF.
The thirty years war between the line and
staff corps of the navy may terminate during
the next session of Congress. The feud began
under Secretary Bone, and has grown more
bitter, until the strained feeling between the
two corps threatens to impair the efficiency of
the service. The long years of inactivity after
the close of the civil war had much to do with
this condition of affairs, for the military
branch, or the line, so called, for want of
legitimate employment has sought to absorb
the functions of the pay corps, engineer corps,
constructors and civil engineers, and has suc
ceeded in making the last-named corps sub
ordinate to the line branch.
The bureau system of the Navy Department,
under which each branch of the naval service
has conducted its own affairs since 1842, has
been a source of great solicitude on
the part of the line or sailor officers,
and they have always argued that these
bureaus, in order to be efficient, should be
under the control of the line. Numerous at
tempts have been made to create a board of
admiratTfy, or a board of advisers, to the Secre
retary ot the Navy, to be composed of high
rank line officers, whose functions would be
an absolute control of the Navy Department,
making the Secretary of the Navy an official
figurehead, and the bureaus entirely subordi
nate to the board of high-grade line officers.
Under Secretary Boric Admiral David D. Por
ter virtually obtained control, with the result
that while millions of dollars were spent the
navy was left in a worse state of inefficiency
than when tho admiral began his work of re
form. It was not alone that money was wasted
on ships to gratify the hobby of this self-ap
pointed ruler of the navy, but be inaugurated
a system of persecution against the staff which
has been continued by other officers of high
rank up to the present time.
To carry on the work of the navy efficiently
it is requisite that fixed responsibilities with
corresponding rank and pay must be allotted to
each individual In the service, but it was not
until 1846, after thirty- four years' agitation,
that the surgeons received military recogni
tion in obtaining relative rank with the line,
and in the following year the pay corps was
similarly recognized. The engineer corps was
created in 1842, but it was not until 1859 that
Congress conferred rank upon that branch of
the naval service. On March 13, 1863, the
staff corps were graded with the line, and this
continued until 1869, when Porter, taking ad
vantage of the fact that the order of March 13,
1863, had not been legalized by Congress, had
it revoked, and more than 600 staff officers,
consisting of surgeons, paymasters, engineers,
professors, chaplains, naval constructors and
civil engineers, were humiliated and degraded.
The stripes, indicating their relative stand
ing with the other officers, were stripped off,
and those who had hitherto ranked with cap
tains were reduced to commanders, command
ers to lieutenants and lieutenant-commanders
to masters, while others had to resume their
civilian clothes and had no military standing.
By act of March 3, 1871, increased rank was
conferred on all staff officers, and this law still
operates, subject, ot course, to such modifica
tions as it is possible for the line branch to
construe and enact to the disadvantage of of
ficers not of the line.
Yet, notwithstanding the plain provision
and meaning of the law of Congress, the line
practically ignores the staff as officers and
treats them, as they term them, as civilian
officers and non-combatants. The line con
siders itsell as the "salt of the earth," and, as
graduates of the Annapolis school, to be the
military aristocracy of the country. By sneers,
words and acts they have humiliated staff of
ficers, notably the engineer corps, and are
constantly endeavoring to influence legisla
tion by Congress to the disadvantage of the'
engineers.
Through the persistent system of an unre
lenting contempt of what, a few years ago,
they denominated "the greaser*," some of the
brightest talent in the engineer corps has been
driven out of the service, and sixteen have
resigned from the navy during the past eight
years and entered into civil pursuits. While
there ere a sufficiency of line officers detailed
to every vessel of the navy, the engineer
force, so far as officers goes, is short-handed to
a ridiculous degree. The Raleigh, of 3200
tons and 10,000 horsepower, carries 13 line
officers, including 4 cadets, but only 3 en
gineers and 2 cadet engineers. The Cas
tine, of 1177 tons and 2200 horsepower, car
ries 8 line officers, but only 1 engineer. There
are line officers enough to take their regular
watches, but the two engine-rooms in tne
Castiue are left to the supervision of a solitary
engineer; and on the Kaleigh only two en
gineers act as watch officers-. It is, of course,
a physical impossibility for engineer officer!
to be in the engine-rooms for twenty-four
hours, or twelve hours, at one stretch; yet In
the event of accident that officer is held re
sponsible, and a court composed of line offi
cers is sure to convict him of neglect, and
either recommend his dismissal or sentence
him to years of suspension.
As a natural result quite a number of mid
dle-aged and even young engineer officers
have succumbed to the strain, some dying and
others forced to retire from active service.
Political and navy influences were, until
within a few years ago, important factors in
obtaining admission to the Naval Academy.
There are officers in the line corps whose
presence can be accounted for only on those
grounds, but every graduate in the engineer
corps is there on his own merits ana because
he made higher percentages in all tne studies.
It Is from the cream of the academy that
naval constructors and engineers are selected ;
the next skimming makes ensigns or line
officers, and tiie marine corps takes what is
left. Yet, for all that, the line officer still
cherishes the tradition of inferiority on the
part of all other officers not of the line corps.
With the advent of the new navy, its modern
armament and various intricate contrivances,
the sails, pot-metal guns and o:d-stylo evolu
tions and fign ting have been discarded. The
old shell-back sailors have been replaced with
men who know more about their several parts
than the officer in command, for it is a curi
ous fact that the captains, commanders, lieu
tenant-commanders all entered the service
between 1854 and 1863, many years before
the new navy vessels were built.
It was too fate for officers on the wrong side
of 40 to start afresh in the modernized pro
fession, yet those same officers are either com
manding officers or '"executives" on the new
floating war machines. As for the engine
room, the simple engine of 1000 horsepower
and the boilers with forty pounds of steam
have been displaced for engines exceeding
20,000 horsepower and boilers with 160
pounds of steam, and with the exit oi the old
engines the engiueers of the old days are also
disappearing. Chief engineers who rose to
that grade and never run even an ordinary
compound engine gracefully retired, and their
places are being filled with men who know all
about the modern engine. While the days of
study for the line officers terminate, as a rule,
with their leaving the academy, the engineer
is placed in a quite "different position. Still,
promotion goes on in the line regardless of tit
ness, find thus, while the line corps suffers
from the presence of "deadwood" or the pres
ence of officers unfit for various reasons for the
grade and thus excludes the young, meritorious
and ambitious element, the engineer corps has
little or no cause to complain of deadwood in
Its ranks.
The progressive portion of the line has long
recognized the necessity of younger blood In
the higher grades. There are now lieutenants
50 years of age, which in other navies would
be close to the renr-admiral's grade. The pres
ent bill before Congress contemplates a re
organization of the navy personnel, a general
weedine out and consequent promotion of
subordinate grades to higher positions in the
line, and the stall' corps, likewise, come In for
reorganization. They demÂ«nd actual instead
of relative rank to make them safe from the
petty persecutions of the line, and the en
gineer corps demands an increase adequate to
handle the wcrk of the new navy. Its present
force of 173, against 205 in 1887. is to be in
creased to about 350. With equalized rank
and pay in the line and staff corps, with duties
strictly defined and within the proper sphere
of each corps, a better feeling will naturally
result among officers and tend to improve the
whole navy. __^____^^____ â

Editor Dana's Critics J^epublisK Some of
His Old-Jime Utterances
Jo ]ProVe That the Eminent Journalist Has Undergone a Serious
Change in J^s VieWs of Late Years
PROUDHON AND HIS "BANK OF THE
PEOPLE." Being a reprint of newspaper arti
cles written by Charles A. Dana, editor of the
New York Sun. Published by Benjamin R.
Tucker, Sew York (box 1312 V
One of the most amusing pieces of campaign
literature that it has been our privilege to in
spect this year comes from a New York
publisher. A casual glance at the title-page
on its arrival disclosed the name of Charles A.
Dana, the veteran editor of the New York Sun,
as its author. A little further search, however,
showed that Mr. Dana is not responsible for its
publicationâ at least, not just now.
Journalists are subiect to the same natural
laws as other people. Like the rest of human
kind, Mr. Dana was once a young man. At
the early age of 30, this stripling found him
self the occupant of the editorial chair in the
New York Tribune office. This was in 1848,
at about the time when Pierre Joseph Proud
hon made considerable stir in Paris on account
of the ardor with which he threw himself into
the socialistic propaganda. The revolution of
1848 was in full swing.
Then up rose Charles A. Dana, and pro
ceeded, with all the might of his editorial pen,
to eulogize M. Proudhon. In November, 1849,
â¢we find him expressing sympathy for the
revolutionist in this wise: "Property is the
right of possession; at the; same time it is the
right of exclusion. .
"Property is the reward of labor; and at the
same time the negation of labor.
"Property is the immediate product of soci
ety; and the dissolution of society.
"Property Is an institution of justice; and
PROPERTY IS ROBBERY."
These were the principles advocated by
Proudhon.
"Bravo!" quoth Dana. (As we have said,
Mr. Dana was a young man.) And then he
continued at a later period: "Would to God
that this hot and bloody struggle were over
and that peace might come at last to the
world ! And yet I invoke no seemins peace
that the weaker may ever anew be plun
dered, but a peace with Liberty, Equality, and
honest man's and not robber's Order for
its condition. What is the way to such
a place? Through war and destruction,
through such war as that at Rome and that in
Hungaryâ perhaps, too, through such as that
of June, 1848, in Paris." â¢ â¢ * "Letothers give
aid and comfort to despots. Be it ours to
stand ior liberty and justice, nor fear to lock
arms with those who are called hotheads and
demagogues when the good cause requires."
(Mr. Daua was at this time still a young man.)
Time passed on. The stigma of youth was
gradually obliterated from the sympathizer
with Proudhon. The New York journalist got
possession of the Sun, a Democratic organ.
Mr. Dana continued, with a few intermissions,
in full sympathy with the principles of his
party till the present year, when he "bolted,"
giving as his reason an inability to stomach
the platform as formulated at the Chicago con
vention.
And now appears on the scene the party of
tbe second partâ one Benjamin R. Tucker.
Said Tucker is a good deal of a wag. In an
eccentrically printed little pamphlet berepub
lishes Mr. Dana's vaporings touching socialism.
The<e he places side by side with some
of Mr. Dana's recently published utterances.
Herein we find Gtover Cleveland sneeringly
characterized as "The Proudhon of Buzzards
Bay,'' when as MrÂ» Tucker observes, "The arti
cles here collated prove beyond a doubt that,
in Mr. Dana's real belief, to liken a man to
Proudhon is to bestow on him the highest
honor."
Mr. Tucker opines that Mr. Dana will not
greet his efforts to permanently preserve his
editorial utterances while in the heyday of
youth with any cordiality. We entirely agree
with him on this point. We make bold to say
that we should like to witness a meeting be
tween the two gentlemen named to^hear what
they had to say. It would be worth listen
ing to.

EMBARRASSMENTS. By Henry James. New
York: Macmillan <fe Co. For gale by tne Em
porium Book Department; price f 1 50.
Under this general caption Henry James has
AN EASTERN HOT WAVE.
published his last volume of four short stories.
They are entitled respectively: "The Figure
in the Carpet," "Glasses," "The Next Time,"
"The Way it Came."
, It seems strange, viewing Mr. James' con
ceded ability as a â¢writer, that he prefers to de
vote himself to this class of literature rather
than to the production of a good standard
novel. He has, indeed, produced works that
can be so characterized, but there is some
thing evanescent about these sketches. They
are sparkling and forceful as far as they go,
and exhibit to a remarkable degree the
author's command of good English ; but their
value In supporting Mr. James' reputation Is
doubtful. We prefer to take "The Boston
ians" as a sample of his work rather than to
accept any of his short-story volumes.
It can be said that there is nothing very ex
citing in Henry James' writings. They follow
their course evenly and smoothly and appear
to do very well without stirring incident.
They always seem to present themselves as
critical essays, analyzing the passions and
emotions of life; but, as we have said, we
should like to see the author of "The Boston
ians" in the character of a writer whose works
have some stability of purpose. We confess a
weakness for the "novel with an object," and
the latter-day reader of novels is in hearty
sympathy with the sentiment.
MANY FACTS IN A SMALL VOLUME
A NEW HANDBOOK ON CURRENCY AND
WEALTH. By George B. Waldron, M. A. Pub
lished by the r'unb & Wasnalls company New
York. For sale by all dealers; price 60 cents.
There has been no small quantity of reading
matter issued in the past few months dealing
with the current financial problems which
confront the people of the United States. We
have had large books and small books, books
of fact and books of fiction, and books that arc
neither. Amid all these it is somewhat of a
relief to come upon a diminutive brochure,
j bearing the stamp of authenticity, that seems
to place these matters in small space and yet
to leave nothing unsaid. It is compiled by the
statistical editor of "Voice," and will be found
of value, to the exclusion of works of larger
bulk.
Among the considered are the "Money
System of the United States," including gold,
silver and minor coins, notes, etc. ; "Currency
and Finances of the World" ; "The Relations of
Gold and Silver," dealing with prcdnctive and
commercial ratios, relation to prices and
wages', "Wealth and Its Ownership," showing
the production, distribution and consumption
of wealth, growth and extent of trusts, debts
public and private and business failures;
a miscellaneous section on railroads, tele
graphs and telephones, strikes and lockouts,
land and population, immigration and
foreign born, the liquor traffic, and the Presi
dential vote in 1892. Also a complete index.
MORE ABOUT FINANCIERING.
THE MONETARY AND BANKING PROB-
Lh-M. By Lo?an G. McPherson. New York:
D. Appleton <fe Co. For sale by William Doxey;
price $1.
In a duodecimo of 135 pages Logan G. Mc-
Pherson has expanded into an admirable
treatise three essays which were originally
published in tbe Popular Science Monthly
during the months of May, June and July of
this year; the treatise and the original articles
bearing the title: "The Monetary and Bank
ins: Problem."
The author la^s down the propositions that
the maintenance of civilization depends upon !
the exchange of the product of human effort I
and that money is the means whereby this
exchange is effected. Drawing from these
propositions the conclusion that an ample
supply ol money Is essential to the welfare of
civilized men, he maintains there should be
sufficient coin for small retail transactions
and a sufficient paper currency for trans
actions of greater value.
The issuing of coin, he argues, should be
left in the hands of the Government, since
that tends to preserve uniformity in the qual
ity and cognizability of coins, but as the de
mand for larger currency varies with the con

dition of trade, the issuing of paper money
should be intrusted to a well-adjusted.banking
system. He finds an excellent model of a
banking system in that of Canada and sug
gests the adoption of a similar one in this
country.
Neither gold ncr silver forms an absolutely
just standard of value, and as there is reason
to believe that in future these metala will be
even less fitted for the pnrpose than at pres
ent, it has become of great importance that a
more comprehensive study should be given to
the problems involved in money and banking
than has been yet accorded them by the
American people, and for that reason this little
volume may be accounted timely.
RESTRICTIVE MEASURES URGED.
IMMIGRATION FALLACIES. By John Chet
wood Jr. Boston: rena Publishing Company;
price, paper cover?, 25 cents.
This excellent little work makes a strong
presentation of the evils of the present system
of Indiscriminate and unrestricted immigra
tion to this country and the author urges
that effective means should at once be taken to
put a stop, at once and forever, to the admis
sion of ignorant, poverty-stricken, imbecile
and criminal foreigners. He also advocates
tbe passage of a law preventing foreigners
from being naturalized or allowed to vote
until they have resided in the country for ten
years, thereby putting a stop to the manipula
tion of the "machine vote" of aliens, and the
running of so-called alien "voting mills" by
professional politicians and ward bosses for
party purposes.
The author d*>als with the whole question
in a very thorough manner, taking into ac-'
count not only its political aspect, but also its
economic and social aspects; and he justly
contends that, though the economic value of
immigration is very great, yet the true wealth
of a nation is measured not by the acreage or
money, but by the character of its people. He
also deals with the history of the question
and shows that the views expressed by Wash
ington. Jefferson and other Revolutionary
fathers were utterly opposed to unrestricted
immigration, such as has now been going on
for years past.
MISSPENT ENERGY.
THE NEW GOVERNMENT. By Francis King.
Published by the A utbor; price 50 cents.
This little book is not remarkable for many
reasons. It puts forth a scheme for a new
government, in which there is absolutely
nothing new. The author in a short preface
acknowledges this fact, at the same time mak
ing the peculiar statement: "Questions per
taining to commerce, law, money, etc., are not
dealt with, as these matters will be adjusted
at the proper time and in the proper manner,
when the 'government' is once in operation."
Seeing that these little matters which Mr. King
skips so lightly over are usually considered ot
vital importance in any scheme ot politics,
one can at once perceive the value of his work.
"The system Is not visionary," urges the
writer. Herein we respectfully differ from
him. It is simply and absolutely Utopian.
We use this in default of a qualifying adjective
vigorous enough to characterize the absurdity
of Mr. King's claims.
The book under review was set up, printed
and published at the New Government Office, a
printing establishment founded by the author
for the purpose. This being the case, it stands as
a monument of his energy, and it seems to us
that Mr. King, by devoting the same amount
of labor and thought in other directions, at the
same time reconciling himself to existing con
ditions, might have produced something far
more useful, not to say more remunerative.
BEAUTY IN BOOK-MAKING

$2.
It has rarely been our fortune to see any of the
Scriptural "Writings" issued in so handsome
a style as is this one, and at so modest a price.
The Dook under review is valuable, if only to
show that England and the Continent have
not a monopoly of all that is beautiful in the
bookmaker's art It is printed in the early
Venetian style, with specinl designs for the
initials, colophon and rubricated borders.
In preparation of the text Mr. Hubbard has
had the scholarly assistance of his friend, Dr.
Frederic W. Sanders of Columbia University.
The worthy pressman has also been helpfully
counseled by several eminent bibliophiles.
It is a pity that only 700 copies have been
printed on Holland hand-made paper, and but
twelve on Japanese vellum. These latter, by
the way, have all been disposed of. We ven
ture to say that the former edition will not re
main long unsold. The Roycroft Printing
Shop Is to be congratulated on its excellent
taste in the matter of typography, and Mr.
Hubbard should also be accorded a word of
praise for his able introductory essay.

This is quite a valuable little publication,
serving as a guide to tourists who desire to vUit

and the letter-press is clear and readable. The
book contains much historical and other data,
useful both to the native and the stranger with

or four different routes, the distance of each is
carefully enumerated and the cost accurately
stated. Altogether Mr. Hutchings has done
his work well and the attractiveness of the

A CAMP/.IGN BOOK.
WON OX A SILVER BASIB. By T. Carl Spelling.
Published by Hartwel!, Mitchell dt Willis, 107
Montgomery street, >-an Francisco. Fo r sale at
all bookstores; price 26 cents.
This is an interesting little work on the cur
rent financial question, written by a local at
torney nn<l issued by a local tirm of publish
ers,. Mr. Spelling has chosen to direct the at
tention of bis readers to politico-economic
problems by putting them in the form of a
story; this, to use his own words: "Not be

writer to acquire fame as a story-writer, but
in order to secure protracted attention on a

subject which, as ordinarily presented, be
comes tiresome before it is understood in all
its details and ramifications."
The idea appears to us to be a good one, and
while Mr. Spelling makes no extravagant pre
tensions for his work, the little book can be
welcomed as an acceptable addition to cam
paign lit jrature, the more so that it bears the
prestige of being entirely a local publication.
It has, furthermore, the advantage of being
thoroughly up to date.

FROM GREATER NEW YORK
Bob DaVis Runs/lcross a J^umber of Promi
r\er\t Westerners ir\ the Corridors
of the Metropolis
NEW YORK, Aug. 18.â The only ex
cuse I have for not writing a letter last
week can be traced to the fact that there
were no Californians in sight. The terrible
death-dealing humidity that has swept
over the East has paralyzed society,
stopped tourists and visitors and plugged
up the channels that are ordinarily news
producing.
At the present writing over 700 people
have either dropped dead in the streets or
died in their beds. Children have gasped
out their young lives in a struggle for
fresh air and animals of all kind have
dropped dead in their tracss or gone mad.
The hotels are deserted and the registers
show no new naraes. The movements of
those Californians who are already here
have simply been confined to trips to the
seashore and back to their hot rooms and
hotels about midnight. Whenever I do
run across a Western native, he simply
mops his brow, say 3 unkind things to me
for speaking to him and reels off down the
street denouncing the town and the cli
mate.
A breeze such as comes off Ban Fran
cisco Bay every afternoon would be worth
all the money in Wall street this day.
Linen suits, light coats and negligee shirts
have been found to be s'mply worthless as
a form of comfortable clothing. Grad
ually people are beeinning to appear on
the streets with less and less each day. If
the heat keeps up much longer there will
be a few thousand arrests for indecent ex
posure.
Old residents say, "This is the first time
we nave ever had snch weather," but the
visitors don't regard such an explanation
as a sufficient balm for their feelings of
disgust.
Perhaps, thouen, you have had enough
of this.

Another Californian, by the way, has
taken unto himself a wife. This time it is
Holbrook Blinn, leading man with Effie
Ellsler last season, and soon to join
Rolatjil Reed's new company. He has, it
is perhaps well to state, married Miss
Ruth Benson, formerly of San Jose. She,
too, is of the Thesoian order and was lead
ing lady for Mrs. Auzerais when that lady
took a tour from San Francisco to Alaska.
Mr. Blinn was along as leading man.
That's how it all came about. The whole
affair was a clever little incident, and Mr.
Blinn, who was rehearsing with Mr.
Roland Reed's company at the time,
found that he bad a groat many more
friends at the wedding than were origi
nally arranged lor. It seems that he told
his superior that he had a iittie business
around the corner that required his im
mediate attention. Mr. Reed at fir^t ob
jected to the young man leaving the re
hearsal, but when Blinn let the cat out of
the bag all hands took an hour off and
the knot was tied at what is known as
"The Little Church Around the Corner"
in the presence of the company.

I have very frequenty had occasion to
call attention to the strength of the word
California when used at the right time
and in the right place. An incident oc
curred not long ago in one of New York's
leading restaurants where the Bohemians
and actors gather with the newspaper
men which illustrates the point to a nicety.
Mr. Charles Michelson, formerly of San
Francisco, and myself, had taken a seat in
the aforesaid restaurant and after eating
a course or two our friend Michelson in
sisted that the best thing to do was to
order some California wine and have the
garden at the Vatican. Mr. Castaigne's draw
ings accompany the concluding paper of the
group which Marion Crawford hes been writ
ing on Rome. It appears in the Century for
August.
A letter of Southey's just unearthed has this
reference to "The Lay of the Last Minstrel":
'â¢My profits upon this poem ('Madoc') in the
course of twelve months amount to precisely
Â£3 17s Id. Iv the same time Walter Scott
has sold 4500 copies of his 'Lay,' and netted
over Â£1000. But my acorn will continue to
grow when his turkey bean shall have with

"Conjusral Amenities" is the story of a luxuri
ous and high-spirited young woman, who, mar
ried to an English nobleman, gives the worthy
man serious cause for anxiety. Her luxurious
tastes, her greedy desire to make the most of
life, and the colloquial animation of her nar
rative give raciness to the book. A. E. Chiett
& Co., 70 Fifth avenue, New York, are the pub
lishers.
Messrs. Macmillan have Sir Frederick Pol
lock's "First Book of Jurisprudence" almost

the general student and reader.

best there happened to be in stock.
The order was given and the wine duly
tested. "This beastly stuff didn't come
from California," exclaimed Michelson,
who is more of an authority on such mat
ters than myself. He promptly set the
bottle down and announced that he, wanted
the real thing. The waiter glared at him
and started an argument as to the relative
merits of California wines as compared
with other not-so-well-known sections of
the United States.
"It is not necessary to prolong the con
versation with your personal opinions on
wines and their different qualities, so we
will dismiss the subject and you will be
kind enough to bring me a quart of Cali
fornia wine," answered Charles, with that
detestable calm stare of his.
The flunkey looked dazed a minute, and
muttered something 10 which the Cuban
correspondent very promptly took excep
tion. It looked as though a row was to
occur. The waiter took hold of a water
bottle and stood off threateningly. With
a bound Michelson grabbed a chair,
jumped out in the open and, swinging it
over his head, yelled lustily:
"Vive California."
In an instant twenty men left their
seats and closed in a circle around him.
"We are with you and California," they
cried a 9if one man, and it would have
been a very unhealthy exercise for any
body to come up against that circle. It
was a great sight, and in another moment
a wild yell of approval went up from the
onlookers, and the waiter took himself off.
When order was restored congratulations
were passed around, and Charlie got his
wine just the way he wanted it.

Orrin Black, the well-known newspaper

The theatrical season is picking up here
a little and one meets a good many of the
California school along the Rialto. Miss
Virginia Jackson, a niece of Sub-Treasurer
Jackson, is in the city at present, prepar
ing to go out this season with some trans
continental company. She has had two
or three offers, but has accepted none of
them as yet. The young lady is one of
the most talented women who ever went
out of San Francisco and her ability i 3 ap
preciated by managers here.
Albert Lando, formerly of the old Al
cazar Company and one of the members
of the "Evans and Sontag" Company, has
engaged for the season with "The Cotton-
Spinner" Company and will move out in
a few days.
George Hernandez, Horace Thrum and
Stanley Ross, all California boys, are
making their preparations for the coming
season, and there is no doubt about their
catching on, as they have already passed
one winter in New York and done well.
Mrs. Beaumont Packard, at 47 Twenty
eighth street, at one time a resident of
San Francisco, has established a theatrical
bureau here, and is well in touch with all
the California talent.
L. E. Stagge, who started a finan
cial paper in San Francisco last year
ana sold the same out to George Heazle

tried a season in Cripple Creek, but failed
to become very much attached to the
place. Mr. Stagge goes to work on the

his Americanism was as sturdy as Lowell's.
He was firmly rooted in the soil el his nativ

THE
PRE-RAPHAELITES
Nearly half a century ago a few yonng
painters, most ol whom were under 20,
feeling dissatisfied with the condition of
contemporary art, resolved to alter its
technique and reform its ideals! This
might well have seemed a large undertak
ing. We- can easily imagine the smiles
that greeted those fine ideas, the scorn
tnat met ihem from older teacners,
the contemptuous indifference of brother
artists. But, in spite of all this, their
ideas began to prevail. The rumor of
their work got abroad. A great man be
came their advocate, and in a short time
the whole land was ringing with their
names. Itisamazine to remember the
success achieved by these few enthusiastic
young art students who banded them
selves into the pre-Raphaelite brother
hood. There were only seven of them in
the beginning:
Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
William Michael Rossetti,
Holman Hunt,
Frederick George Stephens,
.lame; Collinson,
Thomas Wolnt-r and
John Everett Millais.
The last named became president of the
Royal Academy and o n e of the greatest
painters of the century. He was born in
1829 at Southampton. Partofhischildhood
was passed in France. When only 9 years
old, scarcely beyond kindergarten age ac
cording to modern ideas, he was sent to
Carey's Academy, one of the finest art
schools iv London. Four years afterward
he entered the Royal Academy Art School
as the youngest tmpil ever admitted. Be
fore long he took a silver medal and later
a gold one. Millais' was one of those rare
natures born with a wonderful facility in
bis art, a facility so great tiiat there was
temptation in it to do tnoujrhtless or in
sincere work. Rossetti's influence was a
large part of his inspiration in those early
years, for Rossetti was the leading spirit
of that little band and hi 3 fervor, his en
thusiasm dominated them all.
In order to understand the influence of
the pre-Raphaelite movement one must re
member the reaction that was beginning
in all branches of art against conventions
which had outgrown their significance.
For example, Raphael, in his beauty of
conception and technique, had reached
the supreme point of the Renaissance
movement, as Pater says, "in the midst of
a frozen world the burial fire of ancient
art rose up from under the soil."
The generations of painters who came
after Raphael followed closely in his foot
steps. They copied his arrangements and
made set rules that all art students must
follow in the composition of their pic
tures. Thus what had been to Raphael
the natural expression of what to him was
true and beautiful in art became in his

JKis City Has a j<indergarter\ for the

The schools classed as kindergarten
are common in all civilized countries, but
a Chinese kindergarten, or a school for
the instruction of Chinese children exclu
sively, is indeed a novelty. It is not loca
ted in China, but in San Francisco, Cal.
The almond-eyed, yellow-skinned pupils
are taught by a white woman in the em
ploy of the Baptist Home Missionary So
ciety, and the school is supposed to be the
only one of its sort in the United States,
if not in the world. Outside of the Chinese
and missionary circles the existence of this
kindergarten â so unique a feature in the
cosmopolitan life of California â is neither
known nor suspected.
The Chinese Primary School nt 916 Clay
street is incorporated in our public school
system of education, and between it and
the kindergarten there are essential dis
tinctions. In the one maintained by the
City the instruction is entirely secular,
while in the kindergarten conducted by the
Missionary Society in the second story of
the old Baptist church, at the northwest
corner of Sacramento street and Waverly
place, the doctrines of Christianity are
mingled with the secular training of the '
heathen children. When the little kinder
partners begin to read and are sufficiently
advanced in years they are permitted to
choose between the public school and the
mission school.
In its own sphere the Chinese kinder
garten established last September is with
out a rival. The experiment of the phil
anthropic Baptists has been most success
ful, and the school has an enrollment of
thirty-five children of both sexes â the lit
tle sons and daughters of Chinese mer
chants, mechanics and laborers. The chil
dren, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years of age, meet daily,
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays ex
cepted, and from 1 to 2:30 p. m., under the
guidance of the sympathetic teacher,
amuse themselves with their kindergarten
gifts, songs and gamer, A glimpse at the
babies, as the teacher calls them, in their
classroom suggests many ideas. It is an
animated living picture of childish merri
ment and entnusiasm as comical as senti
mental.
A Call man visited the school a few
days ago and saw the little tots in the
midst of their occupations. The girls
generahy were neatly dressed and looked
very cute in their loose blouses, wooden
shoes, queer hats and long, high-colored,
braided queues hanging down their backs.
A few of the boys were dressed in the
American fashion. Coming away from
borne in a hurry, so as not to be late at
school, one of them had forgotten to put
on hio jacket and was titting serenely
w?"th his companions in his shirtsleeves
and suspenders. His face and easy ap
pearance were in striking contrast to that
of the dandified little chap beside him,
who was dressed with scrupulous neatness
in a drab jacket with a white lace collar
and a blue necktie. Of glaring, fantastic
colors, to which the Chinese are so partial,
there was no lack.
Seated upon four-legged stools around a
followers mere conventionality in which
all sincere and spontaneous expression
was lost The young painters I have
named felt this so strongly that they set
themselves flat against it. As Ruskin,
who was their ardent sympathizer and ad
vocate, said, "These boys like life and they
intend to copy that," so, in homely phra;e.
was their purpose summed up. And that,
in brief, was the secret of the romantic
revival â not in painting alone, but in all
Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti.
branches of art. Coleridge, Shelley and
Keats had begun it in poetry. It seemed
to them better, instead of clinging to the
old forms, dignified by age into classic,
to go direct to nature and life and find
there the stuff to stir the heart and the
imagination. The young painters were
ardent admirers of these poets, especially
of Keats, and almost their first work as a
long, low, table in the center of the
room were the pupils. They w<yre seriously
occupied in stringing together long rows
of beads of many varied colors, and were
chattering excitedly over their task. It
was the aim of each child to make the
prettiest combination it could and to get
through its string without any loss ;of j
time, so as to be prepared for a change of
occupation. . The teacher, to prevent their
interest from flagging, walked around the
table, giving the children complimentary
words and friendly pats upon the back.
English is supposed to be the language
in use at the school, but the teacher has
also a .fluent command of Chinese, into
which she unconsciously lapses at times
when the children become too noisy and
unruly. The course of instruction in the
Chinese school is virtually ; the same as
that in the white kindergartens, though
not carried to such a high stage of devel
opment. It gives a rudimentary knowledge
of English to the children, who soon learn
to count, to distinguish the primary and
secondary colors, net an idea of form and
size, of motion, melody, etc.
They . like dearly to play with the
worsted balls, cubes and cylinders, to do
paper-folding and stick-laying and to sing
their ill >otrative motion songs. Into all
of their ' tasks and games they enter
with a childish seriousness which,
amusing , as it is to spectators, holds the
attention of the participants, keeps them
out of mischief and prepares them for the
sterner duties of later life. "

"for they are regular in their attendance
and as attentive to their duties as can
reasonably be expected considering their
tender years ana undeveloped minds.* ' Oc
casionally I am ; compelled to ; call : at the
home of a tardy pupil, but generally my
babies contrive to find their way to and
from school without an escort."
â  ; When the beads were all strung the boys
and girls in obedience to the word of their
teacher arose, moved the table back against
the wall, stacked Â» their little : stools In ; a
corner of the classroom, and forming
themselves in . a row tang with evident
delight the following:

brotherhood was done in illustration of
his "Pot of Basil." Millais' subject was
the scene of the supper table â Lorenzo
sitting with Isabella ana her lover. Wil
liam Rossetti was the model for Lorenzo.
One of the pre-Raphaelite tenets was that
all figures shall be painted from life,
which hitherto had not been the custom.
Mrs. Hodgkinson, the wife of the paint
er's half-brother, posed for Isabella. It
was of this picture that Holman Hunt,
the generous and enthusiastic brother
artist, said, "The most wonderful painting
that any youth, still under twenty years
of ace, ever did in the world.''
A list of those who served as models for
the pre-Raphaelites would be interesting.
Some of the greatest men and women of
tb.3 time sank their identity in the pre-
Raphael pictures. In Ford Maddox
Brown's great picture, "Work," Fred
erick Maurice and Thomas Carlyle posed
as the principal characters. Fancy the
sympathy for these young enthusiasts
necessary to induce that cantankerous,
nerve- wearied Scotch brain- worker to give
his precious time to such a service! We
do not so much wonder at Maurice's kind
ness in this respect, for he was one of the
founders of the wonderful workingtnan's
college in London, the inspiration for all
the colleee yettlement work which has
since so largely prevailed in the old world
and the new.
Few of those familiar with Millais' touch
ing picture of the "Huguenot Lovers"
know that Charles Collins, a brother of the
famous story-teller, and a daughter of
Charles Dickens stood for the originals.
Those two were engaged at the time, and
who knows how much of the pathos and
tenderness iv the girl's face may be due to
the fact that the model could understand
so well the anguish of the French girl
whose lover was going away to his death.
Arthur Hughes, a brother painter, was the
model for the "Proscribed Royalist" â the
picture where the Puritan lady is secretly
conveying food to her royalist lover. Mrs.
William Morris posed for Rossetti's "Day
Dreams" and Burne Jones for a "Head of
Christ."
Here's a ball for baby,
Big and toft and round!
Here is baby's hammer.
Oh, how he can pound !
Here Is baby's music
Clapping, clapping so,
Here are baby's soldiers,
Standing in a row.
Here's a big umbrella-
Keep the baby dry !
Here's the baby's cradle â

Wd are not surprised to learn that a
lady, whose portrait Millais painted in
those early years, became his wife. Mil
lais had a wholesomely attractive person
ality. He was sturdy and big and fair,
with broad shoulders and blue eyes, a typi
cal Baxon, like William Morris. He was,
moreover, the only one of the brotherhood
blessed at that time with a full pocket.
The failure of the "Germ" threw the
rest into sad pecuniary straits. Its death,
after a brief life of two numbers, left them
a legacy of Â£30 debt to the publisher, and
no prospect of solvency. However, young
hearts and high aspirations are not easily
damped, and perhaps, in their superb self
belief, they dimly foresaw the time when
the little journal, forever immortal ay the
herald of the "Blessed Damosel" and
Woolner's "My Beautiful Lady," would
be literally worth its weight in gold. Mil
lais had no part in this venture. His
genius never led him aside from pnintine.
In 1852, when he was 23 years old,
Millais . painted the two pictures which
most critics concede to be his greatestâ the
"Huguenot Lovers," already referred to,
familiar to all through various prints and
engravings, and "Ophelia." Esther Wood,
an admirable critic, describes the latter in
the following words: "Ophelia, floating
down stream to her death, with her slack
ening hands full of flowers, the very em
bodiment of the pathetic helplessness of
weak and isolated womanhood against the
tide of the world's strifeâ weak indeed
through the isolation of ages, having
never known in life or ancestry the brac
ing discipline of a free and responsible ex
istence. No one of the pre-Raphaelites
has equaled Millais at his best in the
landscape setting of the struggle between
the human soul and the circumstance that
hems it in; and the scenery of 'Ophelia' is
among the most exquisite of his work.
The beauty of the river and its richly
wooded banks, its overhanging branches
and its current-driven weeds gives the
greater pathos to the dyine girl's face, on
which the wraith only of its past and lost
beauty lingers to mock the sadness of her
end."
"Autumn Leaves" was painted In 1856,
William Holman Hunt.
and Ruskin called it "one of the world's
masterpieces." It is a picture of four lit
tle girls piling autumn leaves on a bonfire
in the twilfght. The contrast bttween the
thoughtless pleasure of the children and
the fading evening light and dead leaves
conveys a poignant impression of the in
evitabloness of death and decay. The
feeling of "death imminent," "love pow
tooting in this song were so spiritedly re
produced, especially by the boys, that
several of them tired out before the song
was over, put their hands into their
pockets, sat down on their stools, crossed
their legs and rested in speechless silence.
"What the child imitates," says Froebel,
"hft begins to understand. Let him repre
sent the flying of birds and he enters
partly into the life of birds. Let him imi
tate the rapid motion of fishes in the
water and his sympathy with fishes is
quickened. Let him reproduce the activi
erless," pervades many of his pictures.
Millais himself spoke of it as the "unfin
ished dream." We find it in the "Hueue
nots," in the "Tahella," in the "Ophelia,"
in the "Blind Girl" and in the "Vale of
Rest." The latter is singularly im
pressive, with its two nuns, one digging a
grave, the other sitting on a fallen head
stone, gazing with a calmness almost
deathly at the glory of the sunset. There
is something about the somber figures of
the women against all that splendor of
light which suggests for them no ecstatic
thrill of life, or power, or possible achieve
ment, but merely marks the end of an
other day out of those that pass in solemn
procession toward the grave, which is in
describably awesome.
Millais gradually dropped away from
his allegiaoce to the brotherhood, after
bis election to the Royal Academy -the
youngest member but one ever admitted.
His manner changed entirely. This de
parture of his is seen in different lights,
according to the point of view. The
academy regarded it with complaceucy,
but his earlier friends felt that he had
fallen from his high ideals. Neither party
could gainsay the unimpaired skill of his
brush.
His charming pictures of children date
after this change, and certainly no painter
has given us such chubby and lovable
English youngsters as his. The "Little
Miss Muffitt" is irresistible. One longs
to brush away the wicked snider which
has drawn that dear little dimpled face
into such an expression of dismay.
Andrew Lang says of Millais: "If he
had never touched historical nor sacred
art; if he were not supreme in portraiture,
all admirable in landscape; if nine teen
twentieths of his work were swept away
by accident, his studies of the beauty and
sweetness of childhood would still win for
him a place beside the painter of 'Pene
lope Boothby.'" Sir Joshua Reynolds'
Penelope Boothby had been held to be the
supreme achievement of child portraiture.
Every one knows "Cinderella" and
"Cherry Ripe." Less famiiiar are "My
First Sermon," where the little maiden is
sitting very straight and awe-stricken at
the sound of the preacher's voice, and
"My Second Sermon," where familiarity
has lessened awe to the extent of induc
ing sleep.
The "Northwest Passage," in the Henry
Yate collection, portrays an old sea cap
tain poring over a chart while his
daughter sits at his knee reading from an
open book. The subject is better under
stood by the sub-title, "It Might Be Done,
and England Ought to Do It."
Tradition says Millais got 10 shillings
for an early portrait, while in after years
he got Â£2000.
Perhaps of all the brotherhood Holman
Hunt received the largest sums of money
for his pictures. His "Shadow of Death"
was bought by the corporation of the city
of Manchester for Â£10,500â the greatest
sum ever paid up to that time for the
work of a living artist. The picture hangs
to-day in the Corporation Galleryi an ob
jective point of interest for all sight
seers. It is a picture of Christ the la
borer â the human Christ rather than the
conventionally divine. Thus Millais, in
that wonderful early picture of his,
"Christ in the Home of His Parents,"
shows a boy laborer, his hand torn by a
nail, in a woot'en shed strewn with shav
ings. Yet, in spite of commonplace sur
roundings, the figure is deeply suggestive
of the problem of human suffering and
the sublime conception of the Christian
ideal.
Millais wa? knighted in 1885, and on
Thursday, August 13, 1896, died in the
full vigor of a splendid maturity.

WONDERFUL MEXICAN COLS
Irv Guanajuato You Fir\d Jhem ir\ All Colors,
Shapes ar\d Sizes
"The most marvelous country for opals
that I ever saw or heard of," said ex-
Assemblyman P. H. Mack of Inyo County
last night at the Russ House, as he held a
handful of beautiful opals up to view, ''is
Mexico.
"I have just returned from there and I
declare the opals you see everywhere
astonish you.
"I am mining for gold in an old river
bed at Guanajuato, a town of 50,000 peo
ple, in the State of Guanajuato. The
opals are pretty thick there ana in the
town everybody has them ; but it is in the
little States of Queretaro and Fuebla, just
south of me, that the opals are the most
plentiful.
"You get them there of almost all pos
sible sizes, colors and shapes. I brought
with me some of the rock containing the
opals. Tne gems are scattered through
the rock like garnets in granite, which
many people have seen in different parts
of the Rocky Mountains.
"The opal-bearing rock is often found in v
clay or between layers of clay and stone
of different kinds, and the rock which
bears the opals not infrequently changes
to one great piece of opal.
Ex-Assemblyman Mack of Inyo County, the Owner of the Wonderful Opals.
"Nearly every Mexican you see has
opals for sale. He will go down in his
pockets and fish out a lot of them. He
keeps them usually in little squares of
dark or bluish paper, known as jeweler's
paper, the same as jewelers use for dif
ferent kinds of gems. The reason is that
this paper makes the gems show up better
on account of its dark background.
"The opals are so cheap in some places
that sometimes you can buy a very good
one for as low as 50 cents. It depends, of
course, upon the place and the plentiful
ness of the opals.
"But if it is near the railroad yon must
look oat, for the natives have got to coun
terfeiting the opals. They make them out
of glass that is artistically colored, and un
less you notice closely you are liable to
get one of these glass opals under the im
pression that you have got a genuine
jewel. Along the railroad, too, they sell
more inferior opals tban in the interior.
"Though nearly every Mexican you
meet has opals you will never see the
natives wear any. They are superstitious
about them, as they are in other countries.
The superstition is general, extending so
far, as 1 understand, from one side of the
country to the other.
"A native that is so poor as to think $5
a small fortune will oftentimes have
enough opals in his possession to net $25
to $50 if he had them in this country. Be
sides this he always knows where he can
go and get a lot more at what to us wouid
be a mere bagatelle.
"The opals' l have I brought up to give
away to friends and to children that 1
know. Some in me collection are quite
valuable. There are a number of water
opals among them, and these are espe
cially beautiful when fixed in a neat gold
setting. Many of the others are quite val
uable too, for aome of the opals have a
great deal of fire in them.
"I want to say that the Mexicans in
these curious mining regions do not look
with favor on the movement here of free
silver. Since the Mexican Government
has established free silver coinage the
people have been buying just as little as
they could help of the things we have.
The reason is they have to pay double
rates, and the result is that manufactories
of different kinds are springing up in
Mexico to supply home demands. There
is one company that has come in there
and is putting in a plant costing $1,000,
--000. The people there believe if the people
in the United States have free silver it will
tend to stop manufacturing there. As it
is, they want to develop their own re
sources, keeping their money at home.
"But as to these opals. They are so plen
tiful that in many parts they are looked
upon as of little value. They wouldn't be
of much value if they were unable to sell
them. As it is, the tourists and travelers
of various kinds are their best customers.
Scarcely a man goes to Mexico now that
does not bring back a lot of these pretty
gems with them."
Mr. Mack, who has large mining inter
ests at Guanajuato, is here on a business
trip in reference to his mines. He con*
siders Mexico a country of fabulous wealth
and says it offers magnificent inducements
for gold and silver mining.

Henry Warren came to California on the
tidal wave of 1849, and at once started to
make money. In a few years he was rich
and gradually growing richer, but witball
of his wealth he never aided a friend nor
gave an opDortunity to a poor person.
Warren was in the real estate business
and was as hard a landlord as ever evicted
a tenant. He also loaned money on good
security and increased nis wealth by any
possible means. He refused to educate
his son, saying that he should work in
stead of being a loafer. The boy went to
Arizona and died there because his father
refused to send him money when he took
sick. Warren also had a daughter whom
he allowed to die in the poorhouse be
cause she married a penniless man in
stead of a wealthy saloon - keeper he
wished her to. Warren's wife died in
misery on account of her husband's crn
elty to her children and also because he
refused to provide her with the proper
medical treatment None of these things
disturbed \V arren very much and he went
along increasing his wealth and making
people suffer on all sides of hira.
But his turn came in due time and in
spite of his best efforts he found his wealth
getting away from him. Bad luck be
called it then, but he now says it was just
ice. His health has never failed him, but
his money Kept getting less and less, until
he had to apply for a job to keep himself
supplied with the necessaries of life. Bat
he was too well known, ana even those he
used to call his friends wanted nothing to
do with him. He left town, but ever his
reputation followed him. He was scorned
by all who ever knew him, and other peo
ple didn't take to him. And so he went
from place to place, considered a nuisance
by all he met.
"I know I deserve it all," Warren said
when speaking of himself. "I didn't care
for anybody when I was young and had
money and now nobody cares for me.
Why should they ? I never did a good
deed in my life and now I am paying for
it I wander about like a homeless dog
and no living person in the world cares
whether I live or die. I wish I could die,
but lam a natural coward and cannot
commit suicide. I know there Is no hope
for me for years to come, as I am in good
health and cannot even get into the poor
house, but must walk these streets for
days and nights at a time with the curses
of my neglected wife and children follow
ing me. "

|at THEHjPwrisMrnm
Art I
The latest addition to the educational
facilities of San Francisco is the night
class that has lately been opened at the
Mark Hopkins Institute of Art. It is the
first art night class ever started in this
City, in which respect the metropolis of
the Pacific Coast is about ten years behind
other places in the country of the same
size.
To be sure there have in the past
been a few private night classes,
where the students hired their own
model and studio and divided the
expenses among themselves. The Me
chanics' Institute and some of the- public
night schools have had classes in drawing,
but all of an industrial character. None
of these in any way filled the place of tbe
Hopkins Institute night class. The hiring
of the model by the students was expen
sive, and besides they had no instruction.
The night class at tbe Hopkins Insti
tute is on a par with any other similar
class in the United States. It has the
facilities, casts and life models, and the
instructor, John Stanton, is an artist who
stands at the bead of bis profession. The
price charged for tuition is a little lower
than in either St. Louis or Chicago.
Coming back to first principles, it is the
same as the private night classes that ex
isted in the pant â just enough to pay ex
penses. It is so low that any student who
really wants to study can pay it.
As things are now there is no need for
talented young men or women to com
plain of the lack of opportunity. If they
feel that they have talent and cannot
afford to give up paying employment to
attend the day classea they can go to the
night classes and be sure that they will be
put on the right track.
The history of art study in the United
States shows that a great deal more
talent has been discovered in the night
schools than in the day schools. The Art
Studentb' League of New York, wbich
started as a night class, was really the
means of giving about twenty-five great
artists to the world. Had it not been for
the night class these men would now,
most Jitely, be still working at the same
uncongenial trades they were when the
league opened its doors to them. As it
was in New York, so has it been in other
cities, and so will it be here. If no talent
is discovered, it is safe to say tbat none

VINCIENTE, THE SONOMA INDIAN, WHO IS 115 YEARS OLD,
AND WAS ONCE GENERAL VALLEJO'S BODY SERVANT.
[From a photograph taken for "The "Call."]
An occasional visitor to tbe quaint town
of Sonoma is an Indian named Vinciente,
who is the oldest inhabitant in that part
of the country. He declares his age to be
115 years, and that fact is practically veri
fied by many of the first American set
tlers in the locality, who say that in 1849
Vinciente was a very old man. He was
badly wrinkled, and had no taste for the
sports of the younger members of his
tribe.
Vinciente likes to talk about himself.
He speaks only his native tongue and
Spanish. According to his own story he
has had a most eventful career, although
he has never been more than 150 miles
from the place of his birth.
Vinciente says that he was bore in a

exists; or if it does the owner of it is too
lazy to attend the night school, which
practically amounts to the same thing,
for a lazy person will never make a success
of art, even if he had the talent of Micnael
Angelo. It is true that some say Angelo
forest among the hills, not far from the
present town of Sonoma, although he does
not know tbe exact spot. His people were
wild and he grew up like the rest of them,
witb a particular disregard for clothes.
The first event of importance that Vin
ciente remembers was tbe pilgrimsge of a
large number of his tribe to see some won
derful man in a place far to the south.
He was but a child at the time, but from
what he has since been told he thinks the
journey was to Monterey, where Father
Junipero Serra had lately founded a mis
sion. At any event tbe members of his
tribe were not greatly impressed, for they
returned to their homes in the north after
a very snort stay.
As Vinciente remembers, the years went

did all his work by inspiration, but it
might be well to remark that he worked
on an average fourteen hours a day.
It is also known that he worked ten years
in a dissecting-room to acquire his won
derful knowledge of human anatomy.
The class of instruction furnished at the
Hopkins Institute night class is of tbe
highest order. The aim of the instruction
is art. There is no industrial work of any
kind. The students are not taught to
make pen-and-ink illustrations, nor to de
sign furniture or gasjets; they are taught
to draw. The methods used are the same
as in any of the great art schools of the
World, and whatever the student is taught
will never have to be "unlearned."
There are at present thirty-five pupils
in the night classes, nearly evenly di
vided ><j to sex. They attend Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays of each week
and occupy vjve same rooms and work
from the same mvdels as the day students.
There are three classes â the elementary,
antique and life. The rooms are well
lighted by incandescent electric lamps,
shaded and tempered by reflectors. As
far as facilities go there is nothing lacking,
except daylight, which, after all, is not of
any great importance for drawing in
black and white.
All of the students of the night classes
manifest an earnestness of purpose that is
most encouraging. They have no time to
waste. The two hours of each night must
be made the most of. As a consequence
the rooms are almost silent except for the

instructor giving his criticisms.
All the students in the Hopkins Insti

materialâ charcoal and paper, with bread
for erasers. There is no stump and crayon

gan to settle the State. He well remem
bers the founding of Sonoma and the
establishment of the mission. It was
here that he became a Christian and was
baptized. Shortly afterward he was hired
by General Vdllejo to act as body-servant.
For over twenty years Vinciente served
in this capacity, and was with the General
alt through the exciting years that pre
ceded the annexation of California to the
United States. Vinciente remembers the
raising of the Bear Flag, but has no re
spect for the men who did it, because, he
says, they took his master away from his
home when he was defenseless and also
treated the members of his family badly.
When all was settled and peace again
hovered over the land Vincionte still re
mained in General Vallejo's employ. He
held his position until just before the War
of the Rebellion, when he became too old
to work and asked permission to go and
live in the forest again. General Vallejo
granted it and also told him to come to
him wh en he needed anything.
As long as General Vallejo lived Vin
ciente went to see him every week or so
and never failed to get presents of pro
visions and clothes. He likes his life in
the forest, but cannot keep away from
Sonoma altogether. He says that General
Vallejo was the greatest man that ever
lived, and General Vallejo has frequently
made the statement that Vinciente was
always a faithful, willing and obedient
servant.
In spite of his great age Vinciente still
has considerable activity left. He walks
the fifteen miles from bis present home to
Sonoma in a day, but has to rest a couple
of days before be is able to return. He
says tbat he feels well and stiong as long
as hÂ« doesn't exert himself, bat as soon as
be does he finds out that he is an old

shading. All tne student is expected to
do is to draw on paper the object in front
of him or her as the case may be. This
is art. The shading can be acquired
later on. it is somewhat difficult to im
press this fact on many of the new stu
dents. They do not realize that the draw
ing is the hardest part of the study.
In order to get into either the antique
or life classes students must show samples
of work displaying proficiency. If they
cannot do that they must start in the "in
fant" class. Most of them have started
there in spite of the fact that tney brought
some elaborate samples of magnificent
stump shading. Many came to the school
with exalted ideas of their own powers
and specimens of commercial work from
lithograph to colored photographs. Unless
they have a good drawing made from
block, cast or life, they have to go into the
infant class.
Many of them show signs of great dis
appointment at being compelled to do
this.
"Why, I worfeed a whole year with Pro
fessor ," said a certain young lady who
wanted to go into the life class, "and he
said I was able to draw anything. And I
have got a diploma from him, too."
"Well, just sit down at this easel and
make a drawing of the block in this posi
tion," said Mr. Stanton, placing it in the
Last of the
Old Light JoWers
If the captain of any of tbe vast fleet of
bay craft takes it into hid head to sail into
the harbor of Alviso at night, he will have
to do so "in the dark," and this is no easy
task. It Is easy enough to get out of that
harbor, because bearings can be taken on
the lights far up tbe bay, but which are
behind the skipper who tries to get in.
And yet there was a time, long, long
ago, when the lower end of the bay of San
Francisco was like a torchlight procession.
At least that is what old skippers Bay, as
they heave a sign for the good old days of
gold long gone by. It was when Alviso
was an important poit; when all the
freight for San Jose went that wat, and a
railroad down the valley was considered
only as a wild Utopian dream.
Money was not as hard to get then as it
is now, and when the ship-owners and
freight-handlers at Alviso found it would
take years to get the Government to ap
propriate money for navigation lights,
they put them up and maintained them
themselves. There were quite a number,
and the fishing-boat owners also put up a
number of small ones, but of a different
color, so as to avoid confusion.
These relics of the past were all aban
doned years ago, and most of them have
fallen to decay, although an occasional
bunch of sticks rising above low tides
marks where they once stood. But there
is one that seems calculated to stand for
ever. It is at least half a mile from the
present channel and is in about ten feet of
water.
'; It is said 'to have been the largest of all
the lights on the lower bay, and the man
who looked after it did nothing else. hln
shape it is much like ; the ' stake ; lights in
use v along the - rivers, but much more
strongly constructed. :It rises , about
twenty feet "j> above the water, and the
keeper had to climb a rude ladder to reach
the top. It must have been r a dangerous
undertaking in rough weather.
v At present the old : light tower is only
tipped slightly to one side. A few "of : the
rungs of the ladder are broken off, and the
top is in a dilapidated condition. Still it
is possible that it could be used for a lieht,
as the structure itself is perfectly sound.
The only use to .which it is now put,- how

Mineral Water
Jhat Will Explode
Of the hundreds of springs in California
the waters that flow from one in Mendo
cino County are undoubtedly the most re
markable. The spring in question is
known simply as "Little Soda Spring,"
and is located about twenty miles north of
Ukiah, in a very unsettled country.
The water tbat flows from this spring is
unfit for use of any kind. It contains too
much solid matter to be fit to drink even
if the taste were less like saleratus than it
is, and it is so 'hard" that to wash in it is
simply out of the question. The peculiar
easiest way to draw, "and if you do it right
you can go into the life class. If Bougue
reau should come here and I didn't know
him and was not satisfied with bis work I
would make him draw a block ]ust the
same. After that he could get along as
fast as he pleased."
"Oh! that's easy enough to do," said
the young lady almost contemptuously.
"A little thing like that won't take me a
minute."
But she worked a whole hour and then
had only a tangle of lines on her paper
that had very little resemblance to the
object in front of her. They ran in all
sorts of directions and the block appeared
to be out of plumb, lopsided and bigger
on one side than the other. The young
lady worked hard and rubbed out and did
it all over again, so that when Mr. Stanton
came back she was feeling a little discour
aged, but fully convinced that she didn't
know anything about what she was trying
to do.
"You see," said Mr. Stanton, "you know
nothing about perspective."
"Perspective!" she almost screamed in
surprise. "Bo I have to know anything
about perspective to draw a little block
like tbat? Professor never said any
thing about perspective and I made
several large drawings under him."
"Most assuredly you have to know all
about perspective," the teacher answered.
"There is just as much perspective in that
block as there is in the Mills building."
"Oh, dear, is that so? Then I didn't
learn anything at all from Professor
and I cannot go into the life class."
"No, you cannot go into the life class for
many months, and what is more you will
have to unlearn a great deal. What you
have been taught in regard to this work is
alj wrong and you have to forget every bit
of it. Until you do that you can make no
progress in drawing. Now, I will show
you how this block should be drawn and
then you dan gain an idea."
"Why, it looks like a block already,"
she said after the teacher had made about
half a dozen lines. "And can I learn to
do that?"
"Yes," he answered. "All yon have to
do is to get the lines in the right places
and it will look like a block. Now you try
it over."
Oh, what a
struggle it was
for that young
lady to draw that
block! But be
fore the evening
was over she had
something on
her paper that
looked a little
hike the simple
object in front
of her and real
ized that she was
really learning
something.
As she said
herself, she could
hardly wait for
the next class
night. All the
next day she
thought of what
she bad been
toid about lines
running to a
common center,
and perpendicu
lar and horizon
tal, and waslcrazy
to get at tbat
block again.
And she did.
And by study she drew it as it should
be drawn, and is at present on the way to
success, although at the bottom rung of the
ladder. But she has got the right ladder
and is really climbing.
"Do yoiuknow," she said last Wednes
ity of the water is its explosive power, and
also the strange way in which it shatters
the bottle in which it is placed. The
spring is looked upon as a curiosity, but
visited by very few people on account of
its out-of-the-way location.
If a heavy bottle is partly filled from
the spring, and, after being tightly corked
and wired set aside, it will explode vio
lently in about ten minutes. The strangest
part of the phenomenon, however, is tbat
only that part of the bottle above the
water line will be shattered into frag
ments. The lower portion will nearly
always remain intact and retain its con
tents. A piece of iron gasplpe, with thim
bles screwed on both ends, will explode
in about half an hour if it is filled with
the water.
The causes of the action of the water are
hard to get at as it cannot be transported
to a laboratory for analysis. To carry it
uncorked for even a few minutes will de
prive it of its power.
The water Is of the soda and sulphur
variety, and it would seem as if it con
tained some solid substance that started
to transform itself into gas as soon as it
came in contact with the oxygen of air.
This part and the explosion might be
easy to account for, but how is it pos
sible to account for tbe fact that it ex
plodes only in one direction, like some
kinds of gunpowder. Another strange
thing is that at the instant of the explo
sion tbe surface of the water that remains
In the unbroken part of the bottle becomes
of a dense black, like ink.
There is no variation in the direction of
the explosion, and a bottle can be broken
off one inch from the top or one inch from
the bottom, according as it is filled.
It is estimated that there are over 300,
--000,000 sheep on the face of the earth and
that they produce 2,000,000,000,000 pounds

day night, in confidence to her teacher,
"that when you gave me that block to
draw tbe first night I was disgusted
with you. I thought it foolish to waste
time on such things. The more I failed
the more disgusted I became and was
almost ready to go home. I thought you
were trying to make me do something just
for the sake of doing it. But when I saw
you take the charcoal and do in ten sec
onds more than I could do in an hour my
ignorance dawned on me. I saw that you
could do something that I could not and
that gave me confidence in you."
Tbe work in the antique class is done
the same way as thn elementary work.
The students first make drawings of "frag
ments" of the human form from casts.
First feet and bands, then arms and legs,
and then heads. When they have mas
tered all of these they make drawings of
the whole figure. All the drawing is done
in charcoal, and the fragments are nearly
always made life size.
The life class, which is the Mecca of all
art students, is on the floor above the an
tique classes. Only the full-length nude
model is used, and the method of instruc
tion is to teach the student to draw the
man in front of them. Not put a man in
the same position as the one in front of
them, but that particular man as he Is
from head to foot. Detail is not consid
ered. The student must show him by the
character of the figure. There is as much
individuality of character in a man's arm
as in his face, and that must be delineated
by the outline before the work of shading
begins. The work of putting in the
muscles, veins, etc., is a comparatively
easy matter.
There are not many student* in the life
class at present and they have all had con
siderable instruction before. However,
there are a number of promising pupils in
the antique class almost ready to come in.
There is no woman's life class yet, as there
are none in the night school competent
to enter it, a fact which was a little sur
prising to the instructor. It was also dis
appointing, as a model for that purpose
was on hand the opening night. As soon
as there is even one weman student com
petent to enter such a class it will be
started. The idea of the night class is to
give the same opportunities to women as
to men. Many of the ladies in
the antique class have had
considerable previous instruc
tion, but the only ones whu
asked to enter the life class
were those witb no knowledge
of drawing at all.
"The board of directors is
oarticularly well pleased at
the number of students we
have in the night class," said
Secretary Martin when speas
ing of the matteT. "Tbe
school has been open only
three weeks, and the showing
is a creditable one. But there
is room for a good many more
students, and I guess we will
get them if they are in town.
"There has been need for
anight art class in this town
for many years, but the school
was never before in a position
to establish It. You see in a
class of this kind the tuition
must be low, and the board
of directors are willing that it
shall be run if there is enough
in it to pay for the instructor,
the light and the model,
which is really a big part of
the expense."
There can be little doubt but what the
school will soon be crowded, as students
cannot fail to appreciate the advantages
offered tliem. The principal thing,
though, is that it will be the means of
discoveiing talent by giving an opportu
nity to all who think they possess it and
put it to the test. ,

ANTONE THE FIRST BORN, THE FORTUNE-TELLER OF PETA
LUMA CREEK, AND HIS UNCANNY BOAT.
Along the shores of Petaluma Creek are
more homes of hermits, tramps, crangn,
etc, than in any other part of California.
From the mouth of the creek all the way
up to the little city bearing its name any
amount of queer individuals can be fonnd.
The cause for this is somewhat hard to
discover, but most likely lies in the fact
that the shores of the creek are not built
up, and as a consequence the cranks are
left to themselves.
Antone the First Born, as he calls him
self, is one of the social leaders of the col
ony. He is a fakir of the old school, and
strange as it may seem, be makes a living
out of it. He says he is a fortune-teller,
and also claims that his business is legiti
mate and has been recognized by civiliza
tion for 10,000 years.
According to Antone's own story he
does a good business and a large amount
of good in the world. But his fellow
cranks are not his "clients." Not they.
They have too much sense. It is the poor

FigKt a LiVely
Fistic Duel.
Exciting Scene irv
Daylight or\ a
DoWr\toWr\
Street.
The passers-by and loafers along Mont
gomery street were treated to the unusual
sight of a duel between two men a few
days ago â not ojie of the common modern
duels, when men "draw beads" on on* an
other over the sights of improved pistols,
but the good old-fashioned kind like our
ancestors of many thousands of years ago
indulged in, when they went it one an*
other with tooth, nail, fists, feet and every
other natural weapon of offense. This
duel differed from tne modern duel also in
the fact that both men were quite badly
used up at its termination.
Like most duels of any age, the one in
question was "all about a ladye." Like
most quarrels, tbe worst sufferer was an
outsider who was not even acquainted
with the combatant?.
The men who fought the duel are fruit
sellers, known respectively as Charley and
Frank. Charley has his wagon in one
place and Frank in another, and for many
months tbe patronage and smiles of a fair
lady customer have been equally divided
between them.
About a week ago the lady ceased patron
izing Charley and bought all her fruit
from Frank. At tint she did not let
Charley see her doing this, but one day she
became bold. She walked past Charley's
wagon, which was od Clay and Montgom
ery streets, and up to Frank's on the cor
ner of Commercial.
Charley lost his temper and followed
her. When she had walked gayly up the
street, enjoying the fruit, Charley called
Frank into the alley and the fun com
menced.
There were no police around, and Inside
tbe ring formed by the spectators could
be seen a tangle of men mingling in a
cloud of dust. They kicked and punched
and clinched and bit, and when Frank
was getting the worst of it a man whose
name has since been found to be John Doe
joined in the melee.
Then tbe fight commenced in earnest.
The new arrival was anxious to help
Frank, but Frank didn't want help, so ha
and Charley joined forces. They turned
on the intruder, who was almost a match
for both of them, and the air was filled
with the sound of blows, mingled witb
oaths. Biffâ bangâ crack and the
intruder began to weaken and in a few
moments was laid out on the sidewalk,
howling "murder" until a police whistle
was heard.
Charley and Frank forsook the scene of
conflict and went back to tneir wagons,
where they quickly wiped the blood from
their faces and began calling their wares.
As tbe man lying on the street contin
ued to bowl for help it was not long in
coming. He was assisted to his feet by
the policeman's club and sent to the jug in
tbe patrol wagon.
When the trouble was all over the lady

called Jim, and failed to even see tbe two

As Antone's customers cannot easily
come to him, he goes to them at the littta
settlements along the Day shore. During
the day he receives calls from those who
want his advice, and at night he consults
the oracle and gives tbe answer tbe next
day. All the tomfoolery of a past age is
trone through with, and also a good deal
of incantation which is very impressive to
certain minds. Antone's charges vary
from 10 cents to 50 cents, for which sum
ne will cast a horoscope.
"The reason I have such wonderful
power," Antone said, "is because I am the
'first born' of all my brothers and sisters.
"I have completely exploded the old
idea that the seventh son bad mystical
powers. Judge for yourself. The first
born nearly always dies an infant, while
the seventh born nearly always Jives.
Whenever a first born is spared it is be

Anent the talk on silver and gold, which
one hears everywhere, there is an island
chieftain out in the Pacific who will have
neither, nor will any of the 200,000 people
over which he holds sway.
This chief is To-Kinkin, the ruler of the
Bismarck Islands. In the laud of To-
Kinkin nothing is good but shell money,
and this chief has been so thrifty in times
past that he has accumulated $50,000 in
shells and has them all garnered in a
strong house of his own building, against
a rainy day.
You can visit the island possessions of
this barbaric king and scatter your gold
around a#will, but you cannot allure the
natives with it. They will not have it. If
a man was starving there and a meal's
victuals depended on the purchasing of it
with the yellow metal, or with white,
either, he would become food for the
ravens.
Lieutenant Peter Kolbe, the extensive
trader and planter of the Bismarck Islands,
who is now at the Palace, tells the strange
story of the finances of these islands. In
all his dealings there he uses the shell
money, and he says it is the only kind that
is any account.
"The question of 'sound money' is just
as important there as it is here," said
Lieutenant Kolbe to a Call representative
yesterday, "and shell money is the stan
dard. If you haven't got shell money you
can't do anything.
"If I was offered the alternative of $10,
--000 in gold there or $10,000 in shells, I
would take the shells every time. The
gold would be worthless unless I shipped
it out, and to do this I would have to
stand the expense, or what is called the
exchange. Not exactly the exchange
either, for no native will consent in any
way to have anything to do with gold.
Silver would rank in the same category.
These metals are simply dross there and
of no more value than the glittering
pyrites which one seas in the mountain
pathway.
"This shell money of the natives, of
which Chief To-Kinkin has so much that
he has become the Croesus of tne islands,
as well as the ruler, has been money back
before the time to which the mind of the
earliest white explorer runs. It may be
that it has been money there for hundreds
of years.
"The money is made from the cowrie
shells and the native word for it is de
warra. It is a little ivory-like looking
shell and is found 300 miles from the
Bismarck group on the shores of the Vil
laumer Islands. It is just scarce enough
and pretty enough to make it valuable as
a medium of exchange.
"Into each little shell the natives bore a
m\all hole and then string it on pieces of
rattan, the rattan being about the diame
ter of a stout twine string.
"Six feet of this money is worth about
four marks, or $1, and when the possessor
wants a quarter's worth of anything, or a

he way of altering the records, especially
n the Eastern States.
The first thing that comes under our
ronsideration is the fifty-yard run. This
s a distance which is not very popular,
â¢ecause it is too short. H. M. Johnson,

Champion Sprint Runner.
le professional, ran this distance on
ovember 22, 1884, in New York, in b\i
iconds. L. E. Myers, at that time an ama
ur, covered the same distance the fol
wing December 12 in 5% seconds in the
rroe city. On this coast the distance has
sen covered by A. S. Henderson, then an
nateur, in 5% seconds.
Another odd distance is 75 yards. A
jofessional by the name of James Quirk

88, in the very fast time of T%. No less
lan six amateurs have been credited with
'vering the distance in 1% seconds, but |
dime or a nickel's worth, he chops off a
section with nis knife and hands it over.
"Usually the money is worn in a coil
about the native's neck or over his arm
when he goes shopping. Small pieces,
which correspond to the change or chick
enfeed oi this country, he carries in his
hand or in his hair, for the natives are not
very well supplied with pockets.
"Chief To-Kinkin, who may be called
the Vanderbilt of the Bismarck Islands,
because of his relatively enormous wealth,
has 50,000 fathoms of this money, for, be
it known, the fathom is the unit of value
there, and values are reckoned up or down
from it. The thrifty chief has his cash all
locked up in a strong native house, and
there it has been, or a large part of it, for
almost twenty years.
"Nobody has ever robbed Chief To-
Kinkin, and be has grown more prosper
ous as the years rolled on. He got the
foundation of his fortune by selling
islands to traders and missionaries some
years ago and taking Snider rifles in ex
change. These guns he sold by retail to
bis subjects.
"Rifles were a great rarity there and
possessed ah enormous value. The result
was that the chief had the natives coming
from far and near to him and bringing
their shell money, which they had exerted
themselves in an extra hazardous way to
obtain. He was soon 'on velvet,' as you
say in America, and he stayed there.
"He doesn't draw any interest for this
money, but stored it away, and as it is his
storehouse has become to all intents and
purposes a bank. If a boy there wants a
rifle and goes to Chief To-Kinkin to get
the money to buy it the chief charges him
10 per cent for a short loan. In this and
other ways he makes his shell money earn
other money for him.

these are overshadowed by the perform
ance of L. H. Carey of Princeton, N. J.,
who is credited with 7 3-5 seconds on
May 9, 1891, which is a mere fraction in
side the time of the others.
For 80 yards there seems to be only
one record, but tbat is a very fast one for
an amateur, and one who was not reputed
to be a quick starter; that is, one who
leaves his mart promptly. Wendell Baker
ran the distance against time in 8 seconds
at Boston, July 1, 1888. We shall hear
more of this runner.
The 100-yard run is, in one sense, the
most popular of all field and track sports,
simply because the majority of aspiring
young men believe that they will begin at
this and see how they develop and in what
direction. Consequently twice as many
men enter for this distance as any other.
The record table is elaborate, as will be
seen from the following:
The best professional records are 9 4-5
seconds. Johnson, who was just named,
and who died in this City in 1890, ran the
distance in Cleveland on July 31, 1886.
Harry Bethune accomplished the same
leat in Oakland on February 22, 1888. Up
until 1890 there were no less than eight
amateurs contesting for the honor of run
ning 100 yards in 10 seconds ; so to keep
peace in the family they were all allowed
to hold the best on record. Among these
were R. S. Haley and V. E. Schifferstein
of this coast. However, in 1890, John
Owen Jr. won the championship at Wash
ington, D. C, on October 11, in 9 4-5 under
circumstances that silenced the most cap
tious critic. Everybody who was inter
ested beaved a sigh of relief to think that
all these 10-second records were wiped off
the slate â and some of them were claimed
to be shaky â and replaced by one authen
tic record that would doubtless stand till
doomsday. That was six years ago; and
when I look the matter up I find that the
time mentioned (9 4-5) is credited to the
following amateur athletes: C. W. Stage,
Cleveland, Ohio, September 2, 1893; J. V.
Crnm, Chicago, 111., June 15, 1895; B. J.
Wefers, New York, September 21, 1895,
and May 30, 1896. However, Owen's and
last named are the most reliable.
Australia has two men who have held
up the standard by running the distance
in 9 4-5â W. T. McPherson at Auckland on
February 6, 1891; J. B. Hempton. at Can
terbury, N. Z., February 6, 1892. As for
England, she has never produced a man
who could beat 10 seconds, and conse
quently her list is as long as a graduating
class of a seminary. We are naturally
pleased to notice in that list the name of
L. H. Cary, our own champion of 1891.

stein have been mentioned, the former in
1882 and the latter in 1888. These consti
tute the best and accepted records of the
Pacific Coast.
Next we take up 120-yard running.
This is an uneven distance, but very popu
lar for a handicap meeting. It is particu
larly so in England, where it is used as
much as 100 yards. The very best time
on record is 11}^, by George Seward of the
United States, at London, England,
May 3, 1847. C. A. Bradley, for the past
four years amateur champion splinter of
England, accomplished the distance in
11 3-5, a remarkable performance, cer
tainly. The honors in "America are di
vided between L. E. Myers, who ran the
distance in New York, May 30, 1882, in 12
seconds, and A. S. Henderson, who
achieved the feat on the Olympic
grounds, near Golden Gate Park, . Sep
tember 9, 1891. The latter, therefore,
stands as the coast record.
Passing over a number of interesting in
termediate distances, we come to 150 yards.
The best performance is 14J^, by Harry
Hutchens, the English professional, the
fastest man that ever lived. This was
done at Sydney, Australia, March 2, 1887.
The best amateur time is 14 4-5, by two
Englishmen, C. G. Wood at London, July
21, 1887, and C. J. P. Moneypenny, Cam
bridge, February 27, and March 1, 1892.
C. H. KILPATRICK, Champion Half-

The same time has been made in this
country by C. H. Sherrill, New York, May
17, 1890, and by John Owen Jr., who re
peated the performance in one day, at De
troit, lETich., September 13, 1890. Other
professional performers are Westhall of
England and Forbes and Johnson of
America â 15 seconds.
Next we take up 200-yard running.
This also is an uneven distance, and
seldom run, but it will be interesting to
consider some times that have been made.
Seward ran this distance in 19}- a ' seconds
they are paid for them. In bis dilemma
probably a young man has no other
chance to get money than from the
chief.
"After the chief's rifle speculation he
had all his loose money strung on long
pieces of rattan. Sixty feet, or ten fathoms,
is a fair price for a wife.
"I know another chief down there, a
chief known as To-Garu, who has about
20,000 fathoms of money. He cuts quite a
figure as a financier, also, but of course
does not take rank with To-Kinkin. He
has garnered his cash in much the same
way, is worldly wise and knows how to
take care of it.
"I should not omit to state that there
are some other kinds of shell money in
circulation there, but its circulation is
limited, and is not like the dewarra, the
money of the people. First, there is a
little black shell, in which a hole is
pouched, and it is put on a string. Ten
inches of it is worth 25 cents. This is
known as pele, or tele money. Then there
is another shell there, a ten-inch string of
which is worth from eight to ten marks, or
say $2. There is a pigtail on the end of
the string, and the pigtail adds to the
value, as a man will soon find if he has a
string of it and happens to lose the pig
at London on March 22, 1847. Two ama
teurs contest the honors at this distance â
E. H. Pelling, at London on September 28,
1889, and A. R. Downer, at London, Sep
tember 15, 1894, and May 11, 1895. The
best American time is 20 seconds, by
Wendell Baker, at New York November 8,
1890. Our coast record is 21 seconds, by
Henderson in two successive heats, Sep
tember 9, 1891.
One of the most interesting and popular
distances is 220 yards. It is at this dis
tance that the amateur surpasses the pro
fessional, for on examination we find that
B. J. Wefers has run the distance in 21 1-5
seconds. He accomplished this at the
intercollegiate games held in New York
on May 30 last spring. The English rec
ords, both amateur and professional, are
21 4-5 seconds, the former by C. G. Wood
at London on June 25 and July 22, 1887.
The professional record â 21 4-5 â was ac
complished by Harry Hutchens at London
on May 11, 1885. The best on record for
the Pacific Coast is 22^ seconds, Septem
ber 23, 1882, by R. S. Haley. The fastest
time that has been run in late years was
at the championship games in 1892, when
E. Mays covered the furlong in 23 seconds.
As this was accomplished around a sharp
curve, while all the great performances in
the East are on straight paths, I consider
the performance an excellent one.
Two hundred and fifty yards is some
what of a favorite among runners. W. T.
Macpherson of Australia is credited with
the fastest time ever made, having run the
distance at Auckland, N. Z., in 24 3-5 sec
onds on February 7, 1891. The professional
record is 25^, by H. Hutchens, at Botany,
Australia, January 24, 1887. England's
amateur record is 24 4-5, by E. H. Pelling,
at London, September 22, 1888. America
is considerably be
hind in this particu
lar, as the fastest that
we have been able to
do is 25 4-5. This was
run by C. H. Sherrill Jr. at New Haven,
Conn., on June 15, 1888.
Three hundred yards will next occupy
our attention. Tne best performance at
this distance is 30 seconds, by Hutcbens.
The reader will notice that it is an average
of 10 seconds for each 100 yards. This time
was made on January 2, 1884, at Edin
burgh. Our best amateur time is 31 1-5 sec
onds, by Wefers, at Travers Island on Sep
tember 28, 1895. A. R. Downer holds the
record for Scotiand, having run at Glas
gow, June 10, 1895, in 31 2-5. England's
best time is by C. G. Wood, at London,
July 21, 1887-31^ set
Three hundred and fifty yards is a dis
tance that has occupied some attention
from runners. L. E. Myers is credited
witb having run the distance in a 440-yard
race in 36 4-5 seconds. Hutchens ran it in
38 2-5. Mortimer Remington, an Ameri
cau, had the peculiar fortune of making a
best on record in England, though he
could not do so in his own country. He
made this distance in 37 3-5, at London,
July 11, 1891. The best ever credited to an
English amateur is 39 1-5, by E. C. Bredin,
at London, April 13, 1895. Geo. Baikd.

Jke Old
Ferry dock
The old ferry clock, which has timed the
going and coming of all who enter San
Francisco by the bay for a generation past,
has experienced another vicissitude of its
fortunes and now adorns the front of the
temporary structure whictj has been
erected at the foot of Market street by the
Postoffice Department.
The old clock, which has been gazed
upon by no less than three Presidents and
an innumerable number of people less dis
tinguished, has had an eventful history.
It was brought from the East about thirty
years ago in a ship which was wrecked in
l he bay soon after its arrival, and after be
ing submerged for a month was raised
and cleaned. It was placed upon the
summit of a building then used as a ferry
landing, and again removed when this
was replaced by a larger structure. At the
time of the demolition of the old build
ing, in order to make way for the new one
now being erected, the clock fell into the
hands of the junkman who bought the
old shed and who again sold it to the
Board of Harbor Commissioners, who ele
vated it upon a tower of its own. There
it rested in peace for nearly three years,
always keeping good time, excepting when
the fog became so thick as to clog the
works.
These attacks of influenza -were occasion
al, however, and such as would afflict almost
any self-respecting clock in so exposed a
position. So excellent has been the gen
eral behavior of the clock that its time
has always been accepted as standard, and
hundreds of people have regulated their
watches and appointments by its infalli
ble records.
Three months ago the same iunkman
purchased the building that had to be
removed to give place for the Postoffice
and the clock with it, and again the Har
bor Commissioners bought it back that it
might return to its old duty. Here it will
remain until the tall tower of the new
ferry building looms up over the bay, and
in this the old ferry clock may find a per
manent abiding- place; but the junkman,
who has already bought and sold it three
times, is confident that he will buy that
clock back again. The clock is held in
affectionate remembrance by thousands as
the first object upon which they paused to
gaze as they entered the City, and its dis
appearance would be painful to them. It
is regarded by many as an old landmark
that should be preserved as carefully as
the one in Independence Hall at Philadel
phia. _
Fish may have deformities, just like
human beings. For instance, a fish may
be humpbacked. There are fish whose
natural shape is such that they are called
humpbacked, but aside from these there
is occasionally taken a fish which is, in a
greater or less degree, misshapen, in this
manner. A fisherman tells of a fish he
once caught that had a slight bend in it.
When in repose the fish's body was not

Lecture or\ the Text "Wky
Will Women?"
It is the literary fashion nowadays to
see in nearly everything a "keynote of the
age." The expression is a taking one;
newer than "fin de siecle," not so com
monplace as "characteristic," and has
that vague impressiveness which so many
meaningless phrases possess. We are apt
to be most deeply influenced by what is
not perfectly clear to us, like that con
verted African Barrett Wendell tells about,
wno found in an old "Book of Common
Prayer" no words quite so fraught with
spiritual meaning as "Augusta, Princess-
Dowager of Wales." Psychological re
search, scientific study, out-of-door recrea
tion, each and every fad, according to its
devotees, is "the Keynote of the age." I
am convinced, bowevor, tbat no one of
these is the true-blue, simon-pure, take
no-other keynote. There is one that em
braces and transcends them all, and it is
found embodied and expressed in that
recurrent phrase which in these days meets
our eyes at every turn â "Why will
women ?"
It is funny, this ceaseless anxiety, this
constant agitation of everybody over the
failings, the fancies and the foibles of
women. One would suppose the woman
question was. something quite different
and apart from the man question â the hu
man question. It would really be rather
dreadful, when one thinks about it, if we
women actually followed out all the good
advice that is offered us. The degree of
painful perfection to which we might at
tain is alarming to think of.

sit, more women than men can find ac

Hotel de RedWood, ir\ the Sar\ta Gruz

J-iistory.
Nearly every traveler through California
has seen and wondered at the great tree
known as "Fremont's Cabin," but few are
aware of the existence of the original
"Hotel de Redwood," which, happily, has
been preserved by its present owner.
Years ago, when the stage wound its
accustomed way over the mountains be
tween San Jose and Santa Cruz, a French
man, who occupied a tract of land near
the summit, planned tbe establishment
of a way station in his magnificent grove
of redwoods. This idea met with the
hearty approval of the stage-drivers and
of all who found it necessary to pass fre
quently over the mountains.
In the midst of an assemblage of giant
trees stood a mighty redwood, fifty-two
feet in circumference, whose boughs nearly

swept the ground and whose hollow trunk
was clearly available as one apartment of
the "hotel." An excavation was made
among the wide-spreading roots, thus sup
plying a cool storage place for liquid re
freshments. A cabin was erected inclos
ing part of the tree and a platform built
and furnished with seats where the weary
traveler might rest in the cool shade of
the branches wi.ich stretched outward
and downward. All around, great trees
with the grace of mighty strength uplited
their marvelous heights toward the
heavens. Voiceless giants are the red
woods, for they have never learned the
mystic song of the pines.
Tbe Frenchman selected the imposing
appellation of "Hotel de Redwood," and
for years he held sway as proprietor of a
stage station, a position of no little conse
quence in the "days of old."
Steps lead directly from the highway,
but so well have the trees protected the
building with their heavy foliage that the
quaint old hostelry does not now attract
even :i passing glance.
On the bench against the massive tree
trunk, and in the shade of boughs down
obtuse angle along the space where three
people could sit comfortably. Two women
companions in a car will sit close together,
their feet on the floor, knees together,
elbows at sides and hands in their laps,
and converse. Two men talking together
will edge around until they face each
other, put their hands on their knees,
thrust out their elbows and spread them
selves over all the unpre-eniDted adjacent
space. And women, neverâ no, they
never resort to that unpleasant habit of
taking a seat near the door, crossing one
knee over the other and compelling every
ingoing or outgoing passenger to aid in
cleaning their boots.
"Why will women endure to drag the
dust of the street along in their skirts?" a
masculine friend asked of me recently,
and upon that he stooped down and with
his handkerchief carefully whisked the
dust of the streets from his polished shoes.
I Tben hÂ« put the handkerchief in his
pocket.
In this same connection might be men
tioned something I saw a gentlemanâ a
professional man, apparentlyâ do on the
ferry some time since. He sat on the
upper deck nursing his thumb. Evident
ly something had hurt it. Presently he
spied a pin on the deck, and bending for
ward secured it. With this he proceeded
to pick and poke at his injured thumb
until he had extracted a sliver, after
which he stuck the pin carefully upon the
lapel of his coat. Now, aside, from what
one would suppose to be the well-known
fact that a pin, which is marie of brass, is
a bad instrument for performing these
minor surgical operations, there are a
good many points besides that of the pin
itself to be considered in connection with
thia little episode.
How was the man to know, since we all
do use pins for such purposes, that that
particular one bad not been in some
poisonous wound? A good many involun
tary inoculations with painful and serious
disease come about in just this fashion.
Ten to one if the next use that pin was
put to was not to pick the teeth of the
economical human being who picked it
up. Picking up pins is a dangerous and
drooping with their weight of green luxu
riance, travelers were wont to rest, en
livening the time with jovial repartee.
Over the entrance is rudely cut the
name, "Hotel de Redwood," and the
word "letters" above an opening in the
door marks the site of a postoffice which
needed no appropriation. The first room
was presumably office and dining-room.
The presence of numerous bottles is sug
gestive of a bar also. To tbe left is the
opening into the hollow trunk of the red
wood which lent its name to this wayside
inn. This room within the tree is seven
teen feet in circumference. From it the
descent is made to the cellar.
Altogether, this is probably the most
unique hotel to be found in the world.
But the old man believed that his estate
was rich in more than visible wealth; that
it abounded in gold, not inconvenient ore,
but ready-made coin buried there years
before by Mormons who passed through
California. Yet all thi3 treasure was, in
his belief, guarded by watchful men who
would at once be cognizant of any attempt
to secure it. He stated that once while
making some excavations he bad found a
can of gold coins, which he examined and
then left temporarily on the fence. A
strange man immediately appeared and
made inquiries concerning the coins. The
Frenchman gave the desired information,
whereupon he was told that all the buried
wealth belonged to the Mormons, and
that whoever disturbed it did so under
penalty of death. He declared that he
knew of and had marked various localities
where treasure was buried, but that under
no circumstances would he dare to touch
it, believing that bis life would be taken
by some of the secret guard.
Those days of his prosperity passed,
and, for lack of gold, he was compelled to
reek a new home- out the forest mon

uncleanly habit at all times, but one to
which men are far more addicted than are
women. Who ever saw a woman stoop to
pick up a pin in a public place ? But I
have known a man to keep a crowd wait
ing on the Oakland ferry while he deliber
ately picked up a pin from the stairs.
Business often calls me into the neigh
borhood of Montgomery and Sansotne
streets. I think I never walk there, how
ever, that I do not see life-and-limb-threat
ening banana or other fruit skins lying on
the sidewalk. When, as I occasionally do,
I find these in the upper part of the City,
I reflect that it is the work of careless or
illy taught children, for women do not
eat fruit in the street. But children do
not wander through Montgomery and
Sansome streets to any great extent, and
I am afraid I have seen more than one of
my brothers walking thereabouts eating
bananas, dropping the peels upon the side
walk for some one to step upon or kick
into the gutter. Which reminds me that
in the many published articles for and
about women I read one some time ago
by some medical pundit, who arguea the
mental inferiority of the gentler sex from
the fact that, as be asserted, women al
ways eat between meals, thereby showing
themselves to live upon a childish level.
I do not know how generally true this
assertion is. It is my own custom to eat
when I am hungry, regardless of orthodox
times and seasons. To do otherwise seems
to me unreasonable.
After all, when the whole story is told,
is it not true that men and women are a
good deal alike, and that the foibles of
each arise more from environment than
from essential differences of character?
It is a curious feature of modern thought,
the amount of advice, instruction, analy
sis, criticism and nonsense written for and
of women. I sometimes wonder if, after
all, we women are not very largely to
blame for it.
When we will gather ourselves into con
gresses to talk about ourselves, into clubs
to read papers to ourselves on ourselves in
every possible relation under the ; sun,
when magazines are published by our
selves for the i exploitation of ', ourselves in
ever? possible way, the other half of the
world can hardly be blamed for supposing
this to be the subject of paramount inter
est to us. V The most of us know, when we
think of the matter, that it is not, and our
brothers know it, too, but it sometimes
seems as though we kept our thoughts for
private consumption. Judging; 'from'; the
small amount of real thought that appears
in print a great deal must be secreted some
where.V Perhaps, some day, it may be un.
earthed, when men and women alike* may
reap the benefit of the discovery. Mean

What are the wild waves saying
As over the sands they sigh?
Why do they groan and grumb'e?
Is it 'cause they're tied so high?
My child, the wild waves murmur.
And angry passions show,

Has stepped on their under-toe.

Away up in Humboldt County is a logging
camp. Here our little Bessie was born. When
she was 3 years eld she went down to the City
of San Francisco to live, as her mother did not
have good health, and- her father thought she
would have better attendance in the City.
One lovely afternoon in the middle of June
they bade good-by to their many friends and
look passage on the beautiful steel steamer
l'omona. Bessie wns wild with delight at the ]
prospect of soon meeting her father, whom she
had not seen for a year. It was also the first â 
steamer she rememb.'red beinij on, as she was i
too small to notice anything when her mother i
brought her down. Now she started off on a
BESSIE AND POMONA.
tour of inspection and you ruay be 6ure she
saw many things to interest and amuse
her. Away up on a little platform called
the bridge she saw a man and, being told
he was the captain, she ran to her mother,
saying: "Oh, mamma, that is the captain;
he can show me more thau any one else. I
am going to speak to him." A moment Inter
a cheery "Good-morning, captain," greeted
the noble skipper, and turning around he saw
MiM Bessie standing beside him on the bridge.
"Good-morning, little girl, what is your
nameT"
"My name is Bessie, and I want you to show
me everything pretty on the ship."
"1 will, but you must be very careful and not
get into trouble."
Taking the little girl by the hand the genial
captain explained the use of the compass and
bells, and, of course, Bessie wanted to ring
one, and he told her how that would cause
much trouble, as the passengers would not
know why ltÂ« was rung. He then led
her Into the beautiful saloon, bril
liantly lighted in the evening by electric
lights. Bessie danced with delight at this
vision of fairyland. In the cabin she met the
stewardess, whom she called the "Lady
Mamma" ot the ship, and who treated her to j
cakes and fruit. The caDtain then took her j
below and showed her the machinery and the
engine-room, and told hor how the engine
carried the steamer on her course, and how,
when he pulied the bell on the bridge, the
engineer heard it aud knew whac it
meant. All this wns new and very wonderful
to Bessie, but she was looking very wistfully
toward the other end of the deck, where she
saw a lovely old cat, with five pretty kittens,
playing with a rubber ball.
Captain Dora:i, seeing her look, smiled, say
inij: "Well, Bessie, you will never make a
sailor. I think we will go forward and see
Towsy and her kittens. They are two weeks
old and we have not yet christened them. I
will let you find some pretty names for them."
Off she ran and was soon down on the deck
mothering and loving tne dear little kittens,
who were not the least bit afraid of her ca
neftse*. The captain looked on, highly amused,
with a merry twinkle in his eye, as Bessie said,
"I will name this one Bessie and I will name
this one Pomona, because she is snow white,
like the beautiful boat, and oh, may I have
her to keep?"
Of course, she got the kitten, and after nam
ing the other ones Towsy, Tom and Xell, she
started off to get a box to make a bed for Po
mona. The cook gave her a box, the stew
ardess a piece of blanket and a bottle of milk,
and Bessie was happy. The next morning they
reached Eureka and Bessie, with Pomona,
went to say good-by to the captain and all her
new-found friends, who were very sorry such a
little sunbeam was going to leave them so
soon. Pomona was carried up to the logging
camp.
When Bessie's pa saw the box he wondered
what it contained, but she told him the kitty j
was all her own, how she was born in the Po
mona and how her name was Pomona. The
kitten was for a time forgotten while Bessie
was viewing the beautiful trees and the lovely
/^% H fill ll^ I
home in the heart of the redwoods where they
were to live. Bessie was glad to be once more
with her father and Pomona was for a time left
to herself. She soon became acquainted and
grew to be a lovely big old cat.
Bessie is now a young lady and Pomona is 6
years old. She has lost all her teeth and lives
on bread and Â»ilk, but Bessie still loves her
and every day when sue returns from school
she finds Pomona standing at the door; she
runs to her mistress, rubs her head against her
hand and sits in her lap as she studies. Last
year they planted some young trees and Bessie
called the first one after the beautiful steamer
and her dear little kitten, "Pomona."

The nutritious and wholesome onion
occasionally finds its vindicators. At the
thriving Montana city of Anaconda there
is a dining chib called the Anaconda
Onion Society. Its first feast was recently
given with distinguished success.
Down in the center of the hall, says the
Anaconda Standard, was set a long table
with covers for all the guests. At each
plate was a Jarge and juicy onion; in the
middle of the table was an array of roeats,
bread, fruit, crackers, cheese and other
things.
At one end of the hall floated the stand
ard of the club in proud conspicuousness.
It consisted of a pole surmounted by a
string of the vegetaDles from which the
society takes its name. On the wall hung
this motto, beautifully wrought:
â¢ In Onion Thkke is Strength. :
Each member wore a pretty bouton
niere of iittle onions. The occasion was
greatly enjoyed by all the participants,
and the society bopes to do much to re
store the onion to the honor and esteem
of the world.
In Montana, as well as on the whole of
the Pacific Slope, the onion attains a
deliciousness of quality which is compara
tively unknown on the Eastern side of the
continent. If the people of the East could
have onions as good as those of Montana
and California it is possible that the Ana
conda Onion Society might find imitators
in the East.

An Adirondack boy of 13 set out last
week to hunt four young crows that he
heard down on the flats of West Canada
Creek, near Korthwood. It happened
that the boy got a bunch shot at the birds
and two of them fell dead while a third
clutched at the brai.ch on which it was
standing, pitched iorward, and was soon
hanging head downward, crying pitifully.
The fourth young crow flew away. The
wounded crow's cries attracted not only
its parents, but five other full-grown crows
besides. All seven circled about encour
aging the wounded bird as ..best they
could. One of them ventured too close
and another shot killed it. The young
bird M)on fell fluttering to the ground,
when the boy killed it.
Sympathy bad brought one bird to its
death. But the crows were not the only
sympathizers with the wounded young
crow. A flock of bluejays from over in
Park's balsam swamp came across the
creek and hopped about in the high
branches of the birch trees, protesting in
bluejay talk against the killing of the
crows. The little birdsâ the woodpeckers
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1896.
and the warblers, the sparrows and the
sapsuckers â peeped louder and more fre
quently tt.an before, showing agitation
over the young crow's cries.
Once a young woodsman, who wanted
venison more than he leared the game
constable, went ileercrustinjj in a yard
away back in the woods where the snow
was five~feet deep. He fount, the deer, a
fair-sized buck, whose horns had been
dropped some time previously, and
he and his companions, with the dog
leading, started on the jump after the ani
mal. The dog got there first and grabbed
the deer by the hams. The deer cried out
and did its best to get away. When, at
last, one of the men got a knife into its
throat the woodsman 'observed that as
many as twenty bluejays had gathered
about in the trees overhead and were pro
testing in loud, angry voices at the killing
of their woods brother.
The Sun told recently about a wildcat
that visited her sweetheart that had been
trapped by a cracker down in Okefenokee
Swamp, in Georgia, and there is scarcely
a trapper of furs but could tell some
story or other of how a beast in a trap had
been visited by one of its species. The
male fox sometimes kills the vixe.n when
she is so unfortunate as to get into a trap,
and some woodsmen believe that it is a
heroic method of trying to release her.
The question has been asked why it was
that when a cow bellowed out in distress
all the others of the herd promptly rus ed
at her and gored her to death. It bas
often been described how wolves set upon
injured companions and tear them to
pieces. Dogs have been known to do the
same thine, while other dogs have been
'observed to run up to an injured comrade,
whining and fawning around an if to con
jure away the pain.â New York Sun.

Dear Editor: Seeing so many letters, I
thought I would write one, too, being encour
aged by seeing my story printed. I thought
that some of the stories were just fine,
especially one in the last paper. I live on a
sheep ranch containin g 6soo acres, and we have
about 4000 sheep. Our house is three miles
from town. I have only been here two years.
Before coming here we lived in East Oakland,
which I think is a lovely place. My sister and
I myself ride horseback to school, as three milee
is of course too far to walk. In the winter we
raise all the little lambs that the men find too
sick to go with their mother. We have nine
now. It is a great deal of work to raise them
and takes lots of patience, but we can afford
that when we know if we don't they will die.
Oi course, they are all named. Their names
are: Bill Butler, Daisy Bell, Mary Lee, Major
McKinley, Ben Bolt. Grover Cleveland, Bessie,
Fannie and Birdie. We raised them with the
bottle. Hoping you will find something of in
terest in my letter, I remain your friend,
Florence Robertson.

Although we did not stet many "berries we
had a good time. We climbed a hill where we
saw many blackberry bushes, but there had
been some boys there and picked all the ber

I have been camping lately with my mamma
up Coos River in a lovely maple and myrtle
grove. I went in bathiug nearly every day,
and slept in a tent and ate under the trees.
When we came home from Coos River, we
went down to Bandon, a very pretty seaport
town. We strolled along the beach and gath
ered some beautiful pebbles, and walked
around the schooner Berwick, that went on
the beach trying to sail over the CoquiLe bar.
Two days after we left Bandon a whale came
ashore on the beach. I wish we had been
there to see it. Hoping to see my letter in
next Sunday's Call, 1 remain your loving

How a Soft Tench oi Ndure Merged
Them Into One.
BY MRS. IDA KAYB.
"If I had kept it a surprise, it would not
have been so bad ; but, you see, the child
never had a party before in her life, and is
not likely to have another soon, so I
thought she might as well have the pleas
ure of anticipation.
"She bas been as happy as a bird getting
ready for it, helping to bake cakes and
writing and delivering invitations; and she
has planned it all over and over again,
how many would be here, how the tables
would be arranged, and what games they
would play.
"Why. I have almost felt youne again,
myself, listening to the child taik, and
this morning when she started off to school
she actually threw her arms around my
neck and kissed me as if I had been her
own mother, and now
"It almost makes me sick. I don't know
whether I've trimmed a liat or a bonnet
straight to-day. I knew something was
wrong the minute I saw her face at noon.
She tried to speak as usual, but she
couldn't, and when I asked what was the
matter she dropped into a chair and be
gan to cry as if her heart would break.
"It was the longest time before I could
find out anything about it. 'Oh! how
could she?' 'My one party â and ray birth
day, too,' she would say between sobs.
Not an angry word, just heart-broken; but
that's her way. No better girl ever lived
than Audrey Ames, and I ought to know.
"Finally I learned that Maud Bacon had
told her on the way to school that all the
girls had received printed invitations to a
party at Gleason's to-night. Audrey
couldn't believe it until she got to school
and found that no one seemed to notice
her at all. Gladys Gleason was the center of
attraction to-day, telling, in quite audible
confidence, group after group of girls the
number of ;akes ordered, the gallons of
.'cecream making and the grand prepara
tions in progress; but not a word did she
say to poor Audrey about it.
"Gladys has forgotten the rainy nights
that it used to be convenient to stay with
'Cousin Audrey' before her father was
elected and they moved to town ; and the
many favors that Audrey had done her,
never minding her slights and her over
bearing ways. I would not have believed
her capable ot such an insult.
"And children are much like their
elders. Not half a dozen will be at Audrey's
party to-night, nor will half a dozen
mothers tell their girls to accept the first
invitation, because â well, because Gladys
is a Gieason, and Audrey is a poor orphan
girl living with Old Maid Eoggs, the mil
liner.
"It's a sname; it's a burning shame, so
it is!" And the sympathetic old maid's
face was buried in her hands while tears
trickled through her fingers on to the work
below.
"I do wonder if Gleason upholds any
such doings," said Miss Boggs' listener,
glad ot a chance to talk at last,
"More than likely he knows nothing
about it. They say he humors those chil
dren to death since their mother died.
He always was a good-natured man â used
to be able to see common folks, too, but
his eyesight seems to be failing since
election. Maybe that's what ails Gladys.
She can't see well on Audrey's level."
Lucy Sykes chuckled over her own wit,
and Miss Boggs dried her eyes to continue
the discussion of Gleason, Gladys and the
rival parties. But when she came to
Audrey, bravely trying to bear her bitter
disappointment, tears made way for sobs,
and Lucy Sykes cried softly in sympathy.
In a private room not many blocks away
sat George Gleason, surrounded by books,
papers, letters and packages, in dire con
j fusion. He was giving his personal effects
a general overhauling before assuming hjs
new duties in the responsible position for
which the people of his county had chosen
him.
Some documents would be needed,
others were valuable, and these he had
sorted and arranged to his satisfaction ;
but there was so much other matter â
trash, he called it â that must be disposed
of, and tuis he was finding no easy task.
I Absorbed in business though he was, Mr.
I Gleason had a heart, and mementos of
the past, unearthed for many years, stared
him in the face and buried for the time
more practical objects.
From an old envelope he took a box, and
from the box a ring, twirling it in his fin
gers, while mental vision reproduced a
winsome face, not of a girlish sweetheart,
but of his sister Anna, faithful and true.
How many times she had helped him out
of scrapes and shielded him from his
father's wrath! How she had begged him
to give up his wiid companions, and he re
fused â until that night.
And knell he could see through the dark
ness a little figure running across the
fields to the old cooper-shop, a favorite
lendezvous of ttie toughs that infested the
neighborhood. And another figure, his
stem father, in close pnrsuit. But Anna
had reached him first, had saved him from
his fatherâ perhaps from worse, for that
very night's '"lark" ended in a fray that
put two of the gang behind prison-bars.
And here, in George Gleasou's hand,
sixteen years later, lay the ring that he
had bought for Anna on his first trip to
the city with his father. But she never
wore it, having taken advantage of their
absence to marry a man whom both op
posed. And it was a terrible mistake, fol
lowed by a life of poveuy and wretched
ness. Ignored by home friends, even by
the brother who should hare been as
much to her as she once wan to him, poor
Anna lived and died. Her children were
scattered and
'â Gladys! Gladys!" called Mr. Gleason,
roused by a step in the ball.
Gladys had been very willing to leave
her father in peace since obtaining his
consent to her giving the party planned
entirely by herself and the housekeeper;
yet she answered his call promptly.
"When your cousin conies
Gladys â *'
"Audrey, papa?" interrupted Gladys.
"Yes; when Audrey comes to-night
bring her to me. I want to give her this
ring."
Gladys' surprise rivaled her confusion.
A p:ettier ring than she had ever owned
to be given to Audrey !
"But, papa, she â she isn't coming."
"Isn't coming!" said Gieason, sternly.
"And why not?"
"Becauseâ l didn't ask her," stammered
Gladys. "I thought we neverâ you never,
papaâ 1
"I see," said Gleason. "It has all been
wrong. This is very wrong. Set it right,
Gladys, or give up your party. Sue is my
only timer's child."
It seemed a tardy awakening, but
Gladys understood. She was a girl of re
sources, but even her brain failed to hit
at once upon a plan to "set it right" at
this late hour. She could not give up her
party, for in three hours her guests would
come, nor could she ask Audrey to leave
her own party, though it must be a
miserable failure.
Sitting on the porch steps she thought
and thoughtâ then Her eyes sparkled and
running to her father she cried:
".fapa, may Ido what I please? May I
have a cab? Will you give me the ring?
I'll fix it all right."
Without a word Mr. Gleason handed her
some money and the ring, clad to have a
disagreeable matter off his hands.
In Miss Boggs' bÂ«st front room four
girls were gathered; Audrey, with red
eyes and swollen face; Kate Lane and Lou
Casseil, two others whom Gladys had
deemed beneath her notice, and Maud
Bacon, too faithful to desert a friend in
trouble. It was not a merry party, for
Audrey could not talk and Maud did
little better. Kate and Lou alternated
abuse of Gladys and sympathy for Aubrey
until their hostess could endure it no
longer. Hurriedly she left the room.
Maud soon followed and found her lying
face downward on the cot sobbing convul
sively. She knelt beside her friend long
ing to speak some word of comfort, but
she could only lay her head by Audrey's
in silent sympathy.
An unwonted noise in the street sud
denly aroused her, and the rattle of wheels
ceased at Miss Boggs' door. Then there
was a sharp rap, followed by cries of "Au
drey! Audrey!" The noise filled the
iront room and the dining-room, and soon*
another arm was slipped around Audrey,
and Gladys' voice said:
"Don't cry, Audrey. We are all here â
cakes, icecream and everything and every
body. We'll have the nicest time now,
and always, too. J ust see what papa sent
you!"
And, sure enough, there they all were,
Gladys and her guests, with everything
that had been prepared for them. The
Gleason party had been brought to Miss
Boggs, and so Audrey had two parties all
in one.
No one seemed to remember that there
had been any change in the original pro
gramme. They did have just "the nicest
time," and, aa Miss Boggs said to Lucy
Sykes the next day :
"It was the compietest surprise I ever
saw."â From an exchange.

THE LATEST AND SMARTEST DESIGN IN DRESS FOR THE AUTUMN SEASON
During the next five weeks we wiil read
a great deal about novelties and the
changes in fashions and can gradually
make up our minds concerning what fab
rics and styles will best become us for the
autumn and winter seasons. Even the
least frivolous of women are wise to give
such subjects their grave consideration,
unless they are so situated financially that
they can give the best dressmakers, tailors
and milliners carte blanche.
But in most cases much thought must
be bestowed upon our wardrobes before
the desired results are obtained.. One of
the first gowns we should consider is a
tailor-made one. Now, take my advice
and spend no lucre experimenting with |
tailoresses who are said to do just as satis
factory work as men, for I have made the
experiment and have come to the conclu- 1
sion that unless one can afford a tailor
dress from one of the best makers it is far
wiser to have a good dressmaker design a
simple little cloth frock and make it do
duty for a tailor gown, for a botched tailor
suit is such a conspicuous and, as a nat
ural result, an utterly useless affair.
Wben possible have the entire garment
made over silk, but if that is rather more
than you can afford have the skirt made
over the very best mohair obtainable, and
if you have a jacket see that the lining is
of a very superior grade of silK, and if the
material is somber in character you can
frequently by selecting a novelty silk give
the garment an indescribable cachet.
After the cloth frock or tbe tailor-made
gown is completed to your entire satis
faction it is well to see that your hat,
gloves and shoes leave nothing to be de
sired. I know of more than one stylish
girl in this City who has made a smart
tailor dress do duty all through the win
ter for calling and tor the swellest of teas,
merely substituting for the severe little
waistcoat or vest a dressy vest, or a dainty
waist which can be worn with such ad
vÂ»nta?e under a jaunty coat. On such
occasions lighter gloves are also donned.
For those who already have purchased
their cloth let me say there are three
tailors in the City who stand well, whom
I know of, who will accept and make up
your own materials, and only one, 1 be
lieve, who declines to do so â at least, he
will take all you send him, but will make
no allowance whatever for your goods.
For instance, if your gown is to be ordered
entirely from him and is to cost $96 or
$150, he will charge you exactly t'ae same
If you send to him every inch of silk and
cloth you wish used; but by purchasing
your fabrics, even if you pay $40 for the
making of a skirt, vest (or waistcoat) and
jacket you can save considerable. There is
a well-founded rumor that all tailor suits
are to be very elaborately braided. The
finest of such work is now figuring, in sev
eral exquisite suits from Paris, and every
stitch of the braiding was done by hand.
Crepe de chine is held in great favor,
and a dress of a shade of softest pink was
worn a few evenings ago by one of our fair
matrons. Round the nem and up each
seam of the skirt was exquisite Brussels
lace applique. The lace on the low-cut
bodice was much beautified by the addi
tion of many opals, and threads ot gold
appeared to be interwoven. The skirt fell
over a slip of pink glace silk of one shade
darker pink. Another lovely conception
worn the same evening was a glace silk of
lime-green and white. The yoke of green
was introauced in the front only, and
bands depended from it to the waist cov
ered with seed pearls and bordered with
luce.
The sleeves were small and puffy, the
green completely covered with pearl stud
ded lace. The skirt of white glace had
three small and very full pinked out

flounces of the green. Throughout the
lining was of the white glace. A striking
looking creation of pale mauve had braces
of an odd shade of green embroidered
with amethysts which were outlined with
gold. A lovely stately maiden, sooi. to
become a bride, has a really artistic and
beautiful trousseau. Several of her gowns

The Work of a
utcKer ir\ Feathers
One day last winter I was pruning in
my orchard when on grasping a twig I
started back in surprise at beholding a
snake lying quietly over it. I was about
to deal it a death biow when I perceived
that it had already left the tribulations of
this wicked world. A'other slayer had
preceded me.
The tree was a French prune, which, as
every orchardist knows, is apt |to have
sharp, thorny spikes here and there, it it
is on myrabolan roots. It is a char
acteristic derived from the parent stock.
A closer scrutiny showed the snake neatly
impaled on one of these sharp spikes, as
if by the hand of man.
I removed the serpent, which was of the
small striped grass species, and pressed
on to the next tree. Here another dis
covery awaited me in the shape of a large
bumble bee spiked upon a twig like the
snake. Nor was this all. Near by on a
neighboring twig was a big scorpion and
higher up on the tree a fat black beetle,
epeared tnrough his stomach. And there
threads which hold in place innumerable
turquoises.
The sleeves are numerous frills of the
mousseiine delicately edged with silver
and small stones. The skirt is absolutely
plain, lined with silk, exactly matching
the turquoises. Inside it is finishea with
a full frill of blue, over which falls one of
pale gray mousseline. The effect is truly
all that the most exacting could desire.
And thinking of silks reminds me that
you should all make a mental note of the
fact that moire is the coming fashion in
silks. All kinds of new waterings are to
be worn and the real old-fashioned moire,
but this fabric will assume a new aspect
when trimmings are taken into considera
tion, for it will not be regarded as fash
ionable unless combined with the finest
embroidery, not only worked in silk and
tinsel thread, but also in stones and
paillettes of all kinds, and there are many
new varieties with oval-shaped stones,
mother-of-pearl and opalescent catseye of
various aescriptious, and so great is the
demand for turquoise blue even the
imitation turquoises have greatly ad
vanced in value.
1 have just seen a truly beautiful white
moire, out of which is to be fashioned ,the
wedding dress for one of our October
brides. The watering is exceptionally
handsome, and the silk is of the quality of
and much like a very fine Irian poplin,
such as used to sell for $4 per yard, but
this moire which was purchased here cost
but $3, and when the quality is consid
ered is very reasonable at that figure.
Many will wear skirts of rich white moire
with light waists this winter.
In another trousseau are two skirts of
the finest white mohair over glace. One
has a pattern of fleur de lis woven in it;
the other is plain. Now most of us came
to the conclusion some time ago that mo
hair had gone out of fashion; such, how
ever, is not the case, as in the last royal
trousseau it figured, and to wear with
light bodices in the evening or at home
at any time it is quite charming,
but by no means inexpensive, as to look
well it must be absolutely spotless and
that necessitates constant visits to the
cleaner. However, if you can afford one or
two such skirts do not hesitate to supply
yourself, as black silk skirts cannot taKe
their place when light bodices are donned.
Really I should give more attention to
were more discoveries yet. A deliberate
survey of the tree disclosed numbers of
insectsâ bees, beetles, wasps, yellow jack
ets, scorpions of various sizes â all impaled
in a highly scientific manner. The tree
was full of them.
It was a sight. I regretted that I was
I alone and the sole spectator of this en
j tomological slaughter-house. The spec
tacle would have been intensely interest
ing to a city dweller. Indeed it is not
often witnessed by country folk.
The tree was the banqueting-hall and
charnel-house of the butcher-bird. This
ferocious fowl is to the hawk tribe what
the bantam cock is to the poultry family.
j He is diminutive but a fighter, aye, a
cladiator. He belongs to the sparrow
hawk variety and is no bigger than a robin,
but he can whip anything double his size
that has wings. Like the bantam he is in
sensible to fear and will attack anybody or
anything up to men ana snakes.
Unlike most birds of prey, however, this
small butcher-bird kills for the very lust

black and mourning dresses, and I have
just read a description of several black
frocks, which show how successfully black
may be treated without looking heavy for
youthful figures in a recent trousseau.
"A handsome black brocade dinner-gown
with a long skirt has the bodice finished
with a deep circular berthe, the edge of
which was thickly embroidered in small
jet sequins, the long waved lines s?t very
close together, and the sleeves a succession
of pretty puffs. Another black broche has
a high white satin bodice with folds of
white silk muslin drawn over it; and
over this is thrown a film of black
lisse with a sort of wavy, irregular
trellis of small black sequins on it, relieved
witb a little bright steel. A deep-pointed
belt is worked with jet and steel to corre
spond, and the sleeves, which are some
what full on the shoulders, have very
pretty long white satin Vandykes running
up the arm. the widest part of the wrists,
and they are outlined with steel as well as
crossed by a long design of jet and steel.
A black broche afternoon dress has a black
silk muslin bodice embroidered with ta
pering lines of jet very gracefully defining
the waist. There is a yoke of dull closely
rucbed chiffon that contracts well with the
brightness of the jet border. Still another
black brocade skirt, which may of course
be worn with any blouse."
Thin black materials of all kinds are
laid over color or white, black over white
being still very fashionable, especially
when chiffon gauze or mousseline de soie is
employed, ana the latest muslin dresses
are being generally made with a lining of
colored muslin over silk, such as white
of murder. No matter if his voracious
stomach is glutted with animal food and
his sharp beak smeared with the blood of
some innocent linnet or lark this monster
in feathers will go on killing just the same.
He begins to murder at daybreak and
never stops until it gets too dark to see.
Then he chooses a perch high upon some
lofty tree and sleeps until morning when
he begins killing again. He slaughters
ten times as many of his fellow-creatures
as he can possibly eat, and the more blood
he tastes the more be wants. The arch
murderer, Holmes, if he had been a bird
would have been a butcher-bird.
He is an active fellow this butcher-bird.
He darts about in the air with the swift
ness and irregularity of a swallow. I
do not know any bird that can escape
him. His vision, like that of a 1 hawks', is
as phenomenal as his swiftness of wing,
and, small as he is, he can see a distant
bird farther than a man can. When he
sees it, if he thinks there is half a chance
to kill it, he drives directly for it, just as a
man-of-war sends out a torpedo. â  When
he strikes he kills'- also like the torpedo.
Now, there was no earthly necessity for
this butcher-bird to impale all those un
fortunate insects on my prune tree. Not
one of them had been touched, as far as I
could see. This bloodthirsty pirate had
pounced upon them and spiked them on
the twigs, apparently for no other purpose
than to add to his collection and see how
many he could kill in a given time. This
also was a characteristic of Holmes, who

over pink, and white over gray is greatly
liked.
Lace is used more extensively than ever
at present, and the demand for it is likely
to increase t bis winter. The newest tint
is ocher, not a dark tone, as the tint is
very faint, but decidedly on the ocher
shade. Point d'ASencon is worked with
steel and gold paillettes and generally
laid over chiffon, which, In turn, covers
satin. Point de Flandres is deemed the
correct lace for the Louis XVI bodices and
frills and jabots which are worn with
them. Limerick lace is also much liked
and in the Princess Charles of Denmark's
trousseau are many flounces of the finest
specimens of this lace. The low-cut, lull
pinafore bodices are now as often made of
lace as they were formerly macfe of chiffon.
Young women will have nothing to do
with basques, but their mothers are now
regarding them approvingly. Of coursj
the godet basque is out of fashion, and
this is good news, as it always crushed
easily, and the long, straight basques of
the Louis XIV coat are so becoming that
they will be considerably worn all autumn
and probably during the following season
as well. For trimming them silk em
broidery will be much used with quan
tities of black Brussels lace. A little frill
around the latest basque is noted with ap
proval by those having matronly figures.
Relative to skirt trimming, it is to be
noted that "the most beautiful ruches and
bouillonnes of two colors, either laid one
over the other or niched together, are
what are most used, and black gauze over
white satin for a foot ruche stands a good
deal of wear and tear. This treatment
confessed that, having committed one
murder, he acquired a taste for the pas
time and thirsted to commit others out of
sheer lust for taking human life, whether
he made anything out of them or not. In
fact, he confessed that out of nis twenty
eight niurders only a fraction of them were
for gain.
The rest were committed for the fun of
the thing. Harry Hayward, who tilled
Miss Gin?, the milliner, made a similar
statement. He also would have made a
good butcher-bird.
But the butcher-bird, in spite of his
gross and brutal instincts, has the palate
of an epicure aud knows a good thine to
eat when he sees it. I was once on a
stock ranch in Monterey County where I
saw him one day at a prank that filled
me with intense indignation, and if I had
had a gun the monster would have joined
his victim in the shades of the next world
in short order.
My attention was attracted to the
strange actions of a robin redbreast, a
female, whicn was flying to and fro across
a ten-acre pasture. She flew from a par
ticular post directly across tne Dasture to
another particular post an 1 after pausing
a moment flew back to the same post she
had before quilted. This was a curious
proceeding, but I soon learned the cause.
The robin was being pursued by a butcher
bird, which was playing with his quarry as
a cat amuses herself with a mouse. The
butcher-bird gave the unfortunate robin
no rest. No sooner had she alighted on
makes the foot look small, and it is for
this reason that the silk balayeuse is not
likely to go out of fashion. Skirt panels
have t>een brought in in contrast with the
gown. For the moment the prettiest are
lappetiners of laceâ that is, wide bands of
lace, with scallops at either side, laid over
the dominant color. Sometimes this is
white, ana sometimes it is black, but vel
vet is also employed for the purpose when
possible: still, it only accords with the
heavier makes of silk." Marcella.
/\s to FootWear
Shoes are topics of interest to all of us
and I hear there is a decided tendency to
wear much Higher walking shoes, and for
cycling is the new gaiter boot, a combina
tion of the shoe and the gaiter. These are
being made in either patent leather, glace,
or of kid which requires blacking. For
evening wear our siippers must not
have large bows or any elabor
ate ornamentation, but when embroid
ery is introduced it must be of
the finest of its kind. Real diamond
buckles, not lamer than a nickel, are fre
quently seen ana are very smart. The
greatest novelties in shoe embroidery are
th â  concave parliettes, which are most
effective in white Â«atm mingled with sil
ver, and in place of buckles the smallest of
bows continue to be worn, the half-inch
ends being fringed.
An English correspondent writes: Prin
cess Maud has a small, pretty foot. She
likes moderately pointed toes and high
heels, not the absurd structures that are
placed under the waist of the shoe, but
the post to catch her breath than the fal
con approached threateningly and drove
her off the post across the field. Why the
miserable bird confined her flight to these
opposite posts I could not conceive, nor
do I know to this day.
For some little time this curious chase
was kept up. The tired robin would
alight on the posti only to be driven off by
the butcher-bird with shrill screams and
menacing motions of wing?, beak and
claws. The hawk would follow her, a few
feet above her head, describing active cir
cles, and occasionally swooping down upon
tier as if to strike but although I watched
him closely I could not see that he did.
Dropping feebly upon the opposite post
the robin would spread her wings and
open her mouth to catch a gasp of air,
when her merciless tormentor would drive
her off again to circle above and swoop
down upon her.
I watched the incident, too surprised to
interfere. The doomed robin grew steadily
wtfaker. Her flight became erratic and
feeble. She beean to flounder in the mid
air like a tumbler pigeon, and once she
fell heavily to the ground. I tnousht her
dead, but the ferocious butcher-bird
alighted beside her, and driving her to her
feet forced her to take wing again.
This was her last trip. Several times in
making the journey across the pasture she
fell, but recovered herself aud flew slowly
on. She was about exhausted, but with a
last despairing effort reached the post.
As soon as her trembling feet touched it
good substantial ones in the place where
the heel ought to be. There are gold and
silver shoes galore, white satin shoes with
bows, and some witb diamond buckles
and shamrocks. One pair is embroidered
with silver and "blue" diamonds, and
has white satin bows finished with the
silver-lined clear beads that can never rust
or tarnish. Bronze and pink and pale
blue slippers, the prettiest shade of light
suede, and many others have been made
to harmonize with dresses, and do so
most thoroughly. Then there are the nut
brown, tan and black walking shoes, the
dressing-room red and blue moroccos, the
riding boots, the warm-lined traveling
boots, and the substantial walking boots,
with fifteen buttons, that have cork be
tween the stout soles and yet are literally
almost as light as a feather. The trees
that are prepared for every kind of shoe
and boot are of light-colored polished
wood, and made hollow to ensure the
least possible amount of weight."

FasKiorvs for J^lerv
Some excellent winter goods have al
ready reached here. The tweeds are es
pecially good, very stylish effects being
produced by odd mixtures. Gray is de
clared to be the color which will enjoy the
greatest vogue all winter. The golf stock
ings on sale at many of our leading s ores
are exactly similar to those which are in
such demand in New York this season.
Socks for general wear may De of black
silk or lisle thread, on which small colored
figures are woven, or gray and brown,
solid color or silk checked with white
figures. Black silk socks only are correct
for evening wear. Balbriggan is the staple
color for hose.
The all-round turndown collar is popu
lar for ordinary wear. The newest styles
have the corners rounded. About two
and three-eighths inches in front and two
and a quarter inches in the back are the
proper measurements. These are exclu
sively worn with colored shirts. For even
ing wear a tall, straight collar nearly two
and a quarter inches above the front but
tonhole is fashionable. Straight standing
with wings opening considerably at the
throat are seen comparatively seldom, but
there is a steady demand for either the
all-round straight standing or tbe all
round turndown. Cuffs continue to be
square and short.
Not long ago Vogue was requested to
fully define the duties of a valet, and in
reply stated :
A good valet should first of all keep
his master's clothes, boots and hats in ad
mirable condition. His aim should be to
turn out his master a perfectly groomed
man. His duties begin an hour or more
in the morning before his master is ready
to arise. The boots and shoes must be
placed on their trees and cleaned and
polished, clothes worn the evening and
day before must be brushed again and
folded, linen look d after and every article
placed in spic and Bpan order. The valet
is told the hour for awakening bis master.
At that time he enters the room as
noiselessly as possible, arranges the toilet
articles, bathrobe, and, finding his master
awake, he opens tbe blinds and lets in tbe
daylight. He then prepares the bath and
fetches the hot water for shaving. When
the bath is finished he brings in the morn
ing mail, the newspapers and the tea and
toast, or brandy and soda, or both, or
whatever refreshment may be required.
He then consults with his master as to
what clothes are to be worn and arranges
them, the outer garments on one chair, the
under garments on another, the shirt with
its buttons in, the tie, the boot of the day.
When it is time to dress he assists his
masterâ turns him out in first-class con
dition. He attends to the laundry, the
mending and pressing of clothes, repair
ing, etc., tbe cleaning of bureau silver,
The Newest Hat, Untrimmed.
the honing of razors and all other acces
sories of toilet.
He is reponsible for everything pertain
ing to his master's wardrobe, and he
should consult him if anything is needed.
Hats and sticks and spats and other items
must be looked after, as well as the more
bulky articles. He can shave his master,
if required. During the day he is used for
messages, for running errands, settling
with tradespeople and such like duties.
He should be a steward, and, to some ex
s he fell over on her side and lay there mo
tionless.
The butcher-bird apparently understood
the state of the game. He approached as
usual, but without any threatening dem
onstration, and taking his perch besiie the
robin, looked intently at her a moment.
Then, satisfied that the incident was
closed, he flew carelessly away and taking
up a position on a post further along the
fence, looked coolly about for another
victim.
I went to the robin and found her dead.
Picking her up the whole tragedy was ex- I
plained. A round hole in the crown of '
her head told the story. The butcher-bird
had scooped out her brains and eaten them
alive. The bloodthirsty monster, not con
tent with killing and eating his prey, had
driven her from post to post that he mieht
have the pleasure of sucking out her
dainty brain, peck by peck, until the last
morsel was extracted, when she fell dead.
Evidently, in the estimation of the
bntcber-bird, the brain of a robin is much
more toothsome when Â«ucked out leisurely
alive than when dead. For a specimen

Ladies' Hats
The new bat for ladies has been
styled the "Golaen Gate Queen," In trade
parlance, and it is becoming to most faces
and coiffures. A fanciful conceit in Its
way with an odd twist that gives it a
rakish effect, which at least has the merit
of removing Mff outlines, already the
"Queun" has L own decidedly popular.
and so it promises to be quite generally
worn this coming fall.
The strangest thing about it is that this
hat is the result of a dream. The foreman
of a San Francisco'hat factory was eiven
instructions to design a novel shape suit
able for the late summer or fall. He was
at his wit's end, it seems, to think of
something new, and this dwelt upon hia
mind, so that after retiring for the night
visions of possible shapes floated about
him. One idea met him everywhere, and
next day he carried it into execution.
The originals were made of fine Milan
straw braid and trimmed with ostrich
feathers. When shown to leading millin
ers it immediately found favor, and as a
result large orders have been given for the
"Queen." In another week it will be seen
on the streets much in vogue among the
ladies. There will be a great variety in
the hat, as it is made in felt, chenille,
plush, satin, buckram and wire.
The hat itself is very simple in shape
and construction, but when properly
trimmed presents a really elegant appear
ance â jaunty and neat and "catchy."
One feature will not be forgotten by the
ladies â that the new hat is of local make,
and that its favorable reception has recu
perated an industry that was languishing
for some time past.

of tke Future
One of the most important questions
now pressing for determination is that of
fuel.
As civilization progresses the wants of
man multiply. The development of tastes
born of the new conditions engages the at
tention of every inventive mind in the
endeavor to supply new wants. The pres
ent century marks the advance of the ma
terial world with a rapidity unparalleled
in history. What were considered luxu
ries are now deemed necessaries. The
raan of to-day looks with wonderment
upon the life of his ancestry, unable to
understand how it was possible that con
tentment had a place in the mode of liv
ing a hundred years ago.
As the expression of each new taste
found its material complement, the belief
in the attainment of every desire has
grown stronger, until there are but few at
the presentday who can be found to assert
that in man's capabilities there is any
thing impossible.
The most marvelous developments have
occurred in the realm of physics, and
therefore in the department of industrial
and mechanical arts. An evidence of such
progress may be found in the record of
patents Issued during the hundred years
last past by all nations. Over 1,000,000 let
ters patent have been granted for inven
tions, of which the United States has
contributed six-tenths. Besides inven
tions covered by patents, it is a conserva
tive estimate to place the non-patented
devices as exceeding the patented ones
threefold.
The production of these innumerable
mechanical appliances requires what is
known as "power," and power, except in
a few instances, is dependent upon an ex
penditure of fuel.
The cultivation of civilized man's tastes
has led to an interchange of products, re
sulting in commerce, requiring a further
expenditure of power and a consequent fur
ther expenditure of fuel.
With developed intelligence has come
the desire to personally know ail that is
possible about other localities, and
so travel has developed. But the old
methods of the ox-cart have been sup
planted by the modern ways. The modern
man is unsatisfied with all but the best
conveniences of travel. The railroad train
and the steamship are alike moving pal
aces, in which are found all the luxuries
of the age applicable to the enjoyment of
life, waking or sleeping.
To remove these huge aggregations of
mechanical comforts from place to place,
whether upon land or water, demands an
enormous expenditure of power and its
generator, fuel.
The ocean steamer requires an average
of two pounds of coal for each horse
power. It must be seen that the immense
Lattle-sbips, employing from 30,000 to 50,
--000 horsepower, are therefore practically
limited in their effectiveness by reason of
the enormous load of fuel they are com
pelled to carry. No war vessel can re
main out of port for any great length of
time because of her inability to carry the
fuel requisite for a lengthy cruise. In the
peaceful pursuit of commerce the freight
capacity of the steam vessel is largely ab
sorbed by the weight of necessary fuel,
while in the case of the, railroad using
steam power a like difficulty exists.
A very great area of our country is com
posed of treeless plains, and its settlement
has been and is to-day retarded by the
difficulty in procuring requisite fueL
Moreover, forests are diminishing. True,
coal is yet to be had in abundance, but in
very many instances has to be transported
lone distances from the mine to the place
of its application.
Electricity as a motive power will never
occupy its legitimate place until it is re
lieved from its dependence on fuel. Nat
ural water-power is capable of producing
cheap electrical energy, but the localities
where available water-power exists are ex
ceedingly few.
Meantime the population of the earth is
increasing with increasing ratio, and the
expansion of man's exactions keeps pace
with the rapid growth. The output of
coal has risen in fifty years from 5,000,000
tons in 1845 to 196,442,451 tons in 1895.
From this brief glance at existing condi
tions we may well conclude that there is
no question of greater importance than is
that of fuel.
In the olden times the alchemist held a
prominent place in the opinion of the
people. He was supposed to be the pos
sessor of occult knowledge and able to put
in practice hidden laws of nature to attain
the accomplishment of his peculiar ends.
While his reputed ability to transform the
baser metals into gold had a tendency to
throw into the shade whatever he accom
plished in the humbler operations of his
guild, yet even in his time the true value
of his profession did not fail of recognition
among those of his fellow-men whose
common-sense rose superior to their
superstition. To-day the chemist is
the conceded master spirit generally
able to shape the key to most of
the complicated locks under which are
kept the treasures of material physics.
The development from tne alchemist to
the chemist has been gradual but im
mense. The one is no longer the appealer
to shells ana incantations, and while the
chemist does not literally transmute the
copper and lead into the more precious
metal, yet he does, by his better knowl
edge of natural processes, convert to gold,
and what is far more valuable â the im
provement of human livingâ nearly all of
the grosser elements.
Chemistry tells us that fuel is a material
of combustion. We burn fuel to produce
heat, sometimes applying the heat to uses
of domestic nature, as in our cooking and
heating stoves, and sometimes to other
ends, as in the production of steam for
power. In either case the fuel is burned.
It undergoes combustion.
We learn from chemistry that two
things are necessary for the process of
combustion to succeed â something to
lurn and something to support the burn
ing, and that the two things best fitted
tc meet these requirements are hydrogen
ard oxygen. The one, hyarogÂ«n, is tlio
most combustible element known, and the
second, oxygen, the best supporter of
combustion. Of course, many other
things than hydrogen, pure and simple,
will burn, Â«nd combustion may be carried
on in chlorine to some extent. (Advanced
chemistry is not certain that chlorine is
not an amorphous condition of oxygen.)
Yet, so universal is the presence of oxygen
in all combustion, that the term "oxi
dization" la a synonym for "burning."
From the earliest times man has used
water for the parpose of extinguishing
fire. And yet water is composed entirely
of hydrogen and oxygen. There used to
be a saying, frequently applied to a vision
ary genius whose boasted ability failed of
accomplishment,- that "he'd never set the
river on fire." Seriously speaking, we are
apparently nearing that time when to set
a river on fire will be a very ordinary
task, literally and actually. To-day a
number of appliances depend entirely
upon the ability to burn water. The na
vies of our own and foreign governments
employ a signal-buoy for life-saving pur
poses which carries a compound known
as "calcium-phosphide," a combination
of phosphorus and calcium, which, when
it comes into contact with water bursts
into flame. Quite a number of elements pro
duce combustion on coming in contact with
water â phosphorus, sodium and others.
Now, neither the phosphorus nor the
sodium burns. It is the bvdros-'en of the
water that does. The phosphorus and the
sodium nave a remarkable affinity for
oxygen, and as soon 83 they come into
contact with water the oxygen of the
water is at once appropriated and the sep
arated hydrogen makes the flame. Pure
hydrogen burns with a colorless flame,
and so in the case of the life-buoy, where a
visible signal is desired, some calcium is
added to give a white color to the burning
hydrogen.
Advantage of the wonderful richness of
water in the elements of combustion is
taken in the production of the gas now
generally used to light our cities and
dwellings. Red-hot cast iron has a great
affinity for oxygen. So in the manufacture
of water gas there is used a oast iron pipe,
having its inside roughened. This pipe is
maintained at a red heat, and while so
heated there is forced through it a stream
of superheated steam. In its passage
through the hot pipe tbe oxygen of the
steam is seized by the hot iron and ap
| propriated to purposes of oxidization,
and there issues from the other end of the
pipe nearly pure hydrogen. It now sim
ply requires that this hydrogen shall be
mixed with some carbon to render its
burning visible to fit it for illumination.
This is accomplished by causing the hy
drogen to pass over the surface of gasoline
or other hydro-carbon oil, when it is
ready to use as an llluminant. Should the
gas be required only for the purpose ot
heating the carbonising process is omitted.
What an increasing of freight capacity
would be had, what economy, if it were
possible to fit an ocean vessel with the
means of utilizing the element in which
it floats, to the production of heat and
consequent mechanical power. What a
simple solution of the question of settling
the treeless plains were the settler able to
apply the water of the spring, or the
stream, or that of the rainfall to the
needs of his domestic ends.
The process of gas-making would in
volve more cumbersome apparatus than
could be used, and that of phosphorus is
too costly. Some other means must
attain to make the ocean available as a
reservoir of fuel.
Electricity has the power to decompose
water and to separate all water into its
constituent elements, hydrogen and oxy
gen, so that they may be collected in all
their purity in separate vessels. But in
the state of our present knowledge of elec
trical energy the process of electrolysis
will not permit of its application to the
production of hydrogen for any economi
cal use in mechanical methods.
Recently the c'aim has been made by a
Swedish chemist of his ability to success
fully decompose water, economically and
with exceedingly simpie means.
To understand intelligently the claims
of the Swede we must have a knowledge
of what water is. Water is a mechanical
combination, not a chemical one. Let me
explain. If you take some oil and water
and placing them in a bottle shake the
mixture thoroughly, there will be pro
duced a milky looking result. Now set the
bottle aside for a period ; then when you
next look at it you will see that the oil
and water have separated; the oil is on
top and the water at the bottom, their re
spective positions being due to the differ
ence in their specific gravities. Now add
to the mixture some alkali, and again
thoroughly shake it. You have then^ pro
duced a saponaceous compound, a soap,
that will not again separate into its com
ponent elements, but will preserve its
soapy character. The first mixture was a
mechanical one, the last a chemical.
Water is an association of hydrogen and
oxygen held in mechanical mixture.
t Professor Olstrom's claim is that he has
discovered a means, electrical in charac
ter, whereby superheated steam may be
separated into the elements of water,
hydrogen and oxygen, available for pur
poses of complete combustion.
I am not in receipt of any sketch of the
apparatus employed and can only describe
the affair from the written text of Pro
fessor Olstrom's letter.
Should the Swedish savant's claim be
proven good and feasible â and it is within
the grounds of probabilityâ what a revo
lution will be wrought. The length of the
battle-ship's cruise will be measured only
by the necessities of her service. The
ocean liner will be able to diminish her
time of transit, by her ability to utilize the
space and weight now sacred to
the coal-bunkers in the enlargement
of her motive power. The freighter,
instead of having to sacrifice half of her
capacity to coal fuel, will use that space
for additional cargo. The maintenance
of railroad operation will be relieved of
the enormous expense of providing im
mense stores of coal at points far distant
from the mines. The individual every
where will be independent of the forest
and the "coal baron." Then will the age
of machinery spring into its loftiest pos
sibilities. Man will simply "turn the
faucet." Nature will do the rest.

Jo Support plants.
A device to support growing plants is
the invention of James Horan of Bridge
port, Conn. It consists of a series ot U-
Bhaped uprights that are each formed
from a single piece of iron rod. One end
of the rod forms a part to stick into
the ground and hold it in position.
These uprights are held together, at the
proper distance apart, by heavy wire, so
that they can be placed in rows from one
end of the bed to the other.
It is intended that this device shall be
placed over such plants as peas and beans,
so that the product will be kept off the
ground. The contrivance should certainly
be cheap to manufacture, and there is no
doubt about its labor-saving qualities
when the amount of time that is usually
consumed in procuring brush and cutting
it and placing it in position so that it will
answer the same purpose is considered.
The Horan contrivance would, of conrÂ«,
do the wont much better and thereby add
to the quantity of the crop.
Russia's European area is 2,095,504 square
miles, and total, with its Asiatic posses
siqns, 8.644,100 square mile*. The total
population is about 115.000,000.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, AUGUST 23, 1896.
[Flammarion's unpublished view of Mars as a companion to our
planet in November of 1894.]
' : At sea on a long passage in an ocean steamer, there arrives
a period when we have become tolerably familiar with the pas
sengers and the objects on board, and when we begin to cast
longing eyes outward upon the distant sails on the horizon,
craving to pass beyond the bulwarks of our floating prison, at
least in imagination, and to make ourselves feel less alone by
conjecturing the conditions that obtain upon those other refuges
that traverse the watery waste.
"Some such period has arrived in our long passage through
infinite space, with no nearer company than other planets and
the tun. Astronomically speaking we have become familiar
with our beneficent prison, earth, and we have noted, as we
ti ink. the most of the important outward facts concerning the
immeasurable multitude of brilliant sails upon the celestial
ocean; we begin to feel lonely, as it were, and wonder what
conditions of life obtain in them, orâ depressing thoughtâ if
even those nearest to us, the moon and planets, could in truth be
void of such life as we could understand and sympathize with;
and that we poor atoms could be voyaging alone forever, gifted
only with intelligence sufficient to realize our isolation.
"At such a point then in our secular voyage we fix our
hopes chiefly upon that planet which of all that we can reach
effectively with our present optical appliances bears tbe most
resemblance to our earth; the other planets, veiled with clouds
of impenetiable density, and possibly steamy or semi-incan
descent heat, seeming unlikely, even if brought within our ken,
to contain such life as would have any fellowship with ours.
But Mars, upon which all the telescopes, spectroscopes, calori
scopes and other astronomical gauges are directed, hoping to
derive some new information at this, our nearest approach to
him, is the counterpart of our earth in some respects, and
deserves all the attention be receives as a possible link with the
life of other worlds than ours.
"Though his year is twice as long as onrs, his day is nearly
like our own ; his seasons so nearly similar that his axis, in
clined like ours, causes a very visible white cap to gather at the
end which for tbe time is turned away from the sun, and melts
it away in summer when the same pole is presented to that
glowing orb, just as does the axis of our earth; his seas and
continents, which show their well-marked outlines as he turns
upon his axis and brings these features in succession into the
sunlight and into our view; certain grlfs and lakes and connect
ing channels, which vary in outline according to the seasons
and the melting and re-forming of what we may call the polar
snows; these and other points, which will be noted further on,
mark him as a possible companion in our solitude and even a s
a communicable intelligence. True, there are important differ
ences that sometimes militate against tbe presence of forms of
life that would greatly resemble ours. Mars has only one-half
the earth's diameter, and only a tenth part of its 'mass.' That
is to say, his attractive power is so much less that a man
of 140 pounds weight here would there weigh only 52 pounds.
One can easily imagine, therefore, all the changes in the form
and structure of the body this would necessitate; not to speak
of distances upon so small a globe being so shortened that
each mile is also much more easy to accomplish. Mars' atmos
phere, too, since atmosphere there must be to produce tbe snow
we see, must be so thin â so loose in texture, as it were, owing
to its small weight â since it does not seem to be deeper than
our own, while it is ten times less under the compacting effect
of gravityâ that tbe lun?s of living, organized beings, as also
those of plants, must be of a far greater abiorbing and assimilat
ing power than we are familiar with. Such differences of struc
ture and perhaps even of function in the highest order of animal
life might, however, not prove insuperable barriers to com
munication if our progress in the sciences should have so run
parallel with that in Mars as to put the two far- separated intelli
gences nearly upon a level; and here, for our encouragement,
we find that Mars, judging by the generally flat and time
worked surface and the apparently small area of water, is, if
anything, at a more advanced stage of its history than our earth.
"Since the sunlight has to penetrate the atmosphere of that
planet before reaching his surface and then to return through
that same atmosphere before being sent back to our eye we
should naturally find some evidence,, on looking through the
spectroscope, of some similar or analogous absorption. But no;
we are told that nothing can be observed but absorption-lines
due to our own atmosphere, through which the ray, however,
has to pass but ence. Therefore, it is argued, if atmosphere
there be, it must be of such rarity or lighlness as would only
be found upon the highest earthly mountains. Still there re
mains the solid fact that the polar caps of Mars could not be
formed or dissolved without a very sensible and practicable
atmosphere, and it is easier to admit a certain want of com
petence in so delicate and difficult analysis, or in the conclu
sions drawn therefrom, than to disbelieve a phenomenon so
plainly visible as the alternate snowy accumulations upon the
poles of that ruddy, earth-like orb.
"We must not forget, too, that the spectroscope has been
notably disappointing in the investigation of nearly all other
bodies shining by reflected light â the moon, to begin withâ
while so admirably fulfilling its office with the sun and stars â
prime luminariesâ as also nebula? and comets. Like its limited
handmaid, the polariscope, which, being directed upon the lakes
of Mars, pronounces that the light reflected from them is not
polarized, and therefore that no water exists in them. Like
that still more limited handmaid in the work of ethereal undu
tions, the thermoscope or bolometer, which has failed utterly to
discover appreciable heat in the rays from any celestial body
(though so sensitive as to measure the heat rays from a stove
half a mile away), but on being turned upon the moon by the
present Lord Rosse induced him to declare that same body to be
colder than the Arctic circle, which his celebrated predecessor
declared to be as hot as boiling water!
"Apparently we must wait for more certain and concordant
results before concluding that the condition of Mars is so very
different from that of earth; and we may yet hope that, since
other eminent observers hava seen clouds and mists, evanescent
falls of snow or hail upon the soil and other indications of
atmospheric action, air is not wholly wanting. Especially must
we take with caution the conclusions of those who, apart from
all instrumental evidence, base their calculations upon the
'kinetic' theory of gases, and roundly state that ibe attraction
of bo small a body as Mars would be insufficient to retain a
gaseous envelope about him, of which 'the outer atoms would
be ever flying off through space* to parts unknown.
"If so encouraging a conclusion could be correct then how is
it that the comets, which bave not a millionth part of Mar's
mass, manage to retain for an instant the huge and inconceiv
ably rare atmosphere which surround and follow them? Clearly
the kinetic theory of gases â admirable approximation toward

EARTH
AN ELECTRIC AIRSHIP.
an underlying lawâ requires some moderation in its use and not
to be strained too far.
"And then there is a solid argument that we have not yet
seen advanced in favor of an atmosphere of some refractive
power at least on Mars' surface. When drawings and photo
graphs of the moon are examined carefully It Is found that in
the 'gibbous' or incomplete phases of illumination the 'ter
minator" or boundary between 1 light and darkness on the sur
face is nearer the center than it should be theoretically. It may
be here argued that the general shape of the lunar surface which
is always facing us may be such as to give the effect observed ;
it may be flatter than the regular disk would indicate; we are
not forced to conclude that there is a gaseous envelope which
refracts the sun's rays and carries them on further toward the
center of the diskâ however probable such a circumstance may
be. But when W. W. Campbell of the Lick Observatory tells us
that Marsâ which turns swiftly upon his axis and, therefore,
can have no such undetected irregularity of figureâ exhibits the
same phenomenon, we may fairly assert that the advancement
of the 'terminator' toward the center of the disk must be an
atmospheric effect, whereby the gaseous envelope of Mars pro
longs the hours of light upon his surface just as our own air
does upon the earth.
"A fortnight or more ago Mars was in oppositionâ that is to
say, our earth passed between him and the sun; and we saw his
surface consequently in full illumination, just as we see the
moon at full when she is in opposition to the sun. Familiarly
speaking, in our race around the orb of day we had overtaken
Mars, which, upon his wider circle, takes twice as long to make
his revolution; and now we begin to see a little of his darkened
side. Since his daily rotation is in the same direction as his
course (as with our earth also), the 'terminator' or the incom
plete edge of the enlightened disk is (the reverse of what occurred
before opposition) a morning line; and the natural features of
Mars' surface are coming out of the darkness behind the planet
into the light or day in front.
"This, therefore, is the time when inequalities upon his sur
face can be best detected ; and therefore every favorable hour
will be eacerly utilized at the Lick and other observatories to
obtain further information as to those remarkable bright spots
that have been seen (like the mountains and crater-peaks of tbe
moon) shining out of the morning darkness at the first touch of
the advancing sunlight upon the Martian surface. Gradually
we shall know whether these are high clouds, a3 supposed by
some, or eimply mountains capped with snow or mist; as more
probably they are, from their occupying approximately the same
position at each successive appearance. This point will have
vast importance in speculations as to the conditions of Mars'
crust; as to the determination of land or water; as to atmos
phere, and finally as to habitation by life forms comparable with
ours.
"The so-called 'canals' seem gradually to be ceasing (as in
reason they should cease) to be regarded as manifest indications
of the work of intelligent beings. Their vast length and great
width oppose such an explanation; and their curious regularity
at the jame time is easily comparable with that of similar fea
tures upon the moon, familiar to those who, like tbe writer,
have studied much and long the lunar surface in an equatorial
telescope of the larger size.
" Mr, J. R. Holt, the Dublin astronomer, has recently ex
plained these angular streaks in this sense; as being fissures
occurring through contractions in the crust of Mars when half
cooled, afterward in part filled up with molten matter, and in
process of ages converted into valleys, perhaps covered with
vegetation, and in tbe center of which a wide waterway has
traced its path. This explanation would certainly reasonably
account for the changing invisibility of those curious features â
since vegetation varies in tint according to the season â and also
for the passage they seem to give to the waters on the melting
of the snow-caps. Possibly, also, it would very simply account
for the 'duplication' of these channels â a phenomenon which
has so puzzled all observers since the time of Schiaparelli, who
first noted these extensive 'double canals.' The vegetation on
each side of the wide channel, changing in color and shade with
tbe seasons of the Martian year, would sometimes harmonize
and sometimes contrast, now with the water channel, and again
with the surrounding country; and so become invisible or visi
ble, according to the circumstances. In this connection Mr.
J. R. Holt recently referred (TAstronomie, 1 p. 337, Sept. '94) to
an observation made by Schiaparelli on the 26th of December,
1879, upon a wide white streak wbich appeared in Mars and
seemed to be the track of a storm of snow or hail. With absorb
ing interest doubtless he looked to see if it crossed one of these
canals (the Nile) without interruption; for, if so, no water could
be there, of course. He found that the center only of that canal
completely absorbed the snowy streak and appeared like a thin
thread joining the broken ends of the wide course of the Nile,
thus proving apparently that water existed only in the center of
these channels, and that the bands on each side which formed
the remainder of their visible width were terra firma, capable of
receiving unmelted the passing deposit of hail or snow that was
being observed.
"Space would fail, however, to detail the many interesting
and instructive observations which have been made upon this
earthlike planet, both in America and in Europe; but sufficient
has been said to show the reasons for the extraordinary enthusi
asm manifested at all great observatories during the present
near approach of Mars.
"But why, it will be asked by some who, from want of
thought, from religious prejudices or from a too great absorp
tion in the things of this particular planet, are unwilling to
look upward and outward to other worlds in prooess of creation
like our own, why should we expect habitation and human life,
or, indeed, any life at all, upon tnose other shilling bodies in
the heavens, even supposing tnat they are constructed ma
terially like our earth?
"To this it may be frankly and promptly answered that the
improbability of our particular grain of dust in the midst of the
infinite cloud of such planetary dust around us being the only
one containing life is so great that every reflective mind must at
once reject such a supposition.
"By millions we may count the stars already, and our im
proving optical and photographic appliances add millions of
new-found suns to these; but yet it is not there any more than
upon our own flaming sun that we seek for life developed to
such a stage as we could comprehend. Each of these blazing
orbs has its planets, its dark satellites, shining only by the light
of their sun and therefore too faint'y to be seen at such vast
distancesâ for our own earth would be quite invisible even at a
distance such that light would take a day to traverse, while the
nearest of these nuns, Alpha Centauri, takes four years to reach
us. Well may we say: 'How wonderful are thy works, Lord
God Almighty, in wisdom. Thou hast made them all.' "
Bottles JKat You
Gar\r\ot Refill
Manufacturers of liquors, wines, sauces
and patent medicines have for years en
deavored to devise some means of protec
tion against unscrupulous people who not
alone imitate brands, but boldly substi
tute inferior articles in the original pack
ages. Thus far, however, no satisfactory
non-refilling bottle has been put on the
market, and the victimized manufacturers
have concluded that such a thing as a non
refilling bottle is an impossibility. Many
patents have been taken out with
no other result than a loss of sixty
or . more dollars to the inventor,
and still the brain - racking work
goes on, having received an impetus
through the alleged offer of a whisky firm
of $100,000 bonus to the inventor of a bot
tle which once emptied cannot be refilled.
Hundreds of people in this City have for
months past tried to solve the problem,
and every number of the Patent Office
Gazette contains one or more d&vices for
which claims are made that even aenrsory
glance proves to be defective. Some of
these contrivances are interesting because
of their absurdity and none are of any
use.
Accompanying sketches show the idea
of an Eastern inventor of how be would
prevent a bottle from being refilled. A
specially designed bottle with a valve V
closing its mouth, and over this a cap
packed partly with cement, C, and thus
fastened to the bottle, are the main fea
tures. In the cap or cover are two porta
through which the liquor may be poured,
figure 2 showing the port in circular dotted
lines. The corrugated outline of the cover
is presumably to get a grip on the bottle.
Aside from the clumsiness of the thing,
the cost of maKing and attaching the cap
to the bottle would be out of proportion
to the value of the service it would ren
der, and, worse than all, it is not a non
refillable bottle, for it would only be neces
sary to place it on its head in a filled tub
or tank and with slight manipulation the
air could be let out and the bottle would
eventually fill up.
A curious Canadian contrivance is that
shown in figure 3. It is a special bottle
with a swelling and an inside rim at
the junction of the neck and body of the
bottle. A metallic sleeve to which is at
tached a trap with a spring and a tumbling
ball valve is pushed down the neck until
the shutting-off valves rest on the raised
glass rim.
The inventor keeps to himself the secret
as to the manner of fastening and working
the spring, and in the design of the bottle,
with its two inside rims, the possibilities
of glass-blowing will be severely tried if
put to a practical test. This bottle, how
ever, like that previously described, is
doomed to disappoint its inventor, for the
probabilities are that the bottle cannot be
made as designed, the metallic contÂ»iv
ance will not be accepted by any liquor
firm, it is too costly and complicated to
be of commercial value, and, finally, there
is nothing to prevent the withdrawal of
the sleeve with its paraphernalia, put in
"Jersey lightning" for "Honey dew" and
replace tbe sleeve. It is not a non-filling
bottle, and the inventor has no good
claim on the $100,000 prize.
A third non-filling bottle is also a Cana-
dian patent, although the inventor is a
New Yorker. It is much less complicated
than many others. It has one serious de
fect, however, in that no means are pro
vided for keeping the metallic valve in us
piace, and even if a seat was made by a
rim the valve being of metal would pre
clude its use for liquors, sauces, medicines
or win 68.
There is an endless variety of worthless
patents in this particular line, and the
time and money wasted must be some
thing astounding.' Still the work goes on,
and a glass factory in this City has a
great assortment of especially designed
bottles made for inventors in the non
tilling bottle line. Inventors, as a rule,
speedily develop into cranks, and they are
hard to deal with. Each one asserts that
his is the only bottle that cannot be re
filled. Arguments to the contrary have no
effect, and only actual demonstration does
convince him that his invention is not
quite perfect. He usually departs in a
huff, as if some mortal wrong had been
done to him.
Now, notwithstanding the fact that
whr>le<m'fÂ» 1 quor-dÂ«Â»aler3 do not believe in
the possibility of a non-filling bottle,
still i yj :tors keep busy, and, while the
solving of the problem does seem to
be beyond reach, it is yet within the
bounds of possibility that the thing may
yet be invented and made practicable.
For the guidance of such people who
prefer to worry their brains on this subject
in preference to getting up an automatic
cook, or a device to make municipal and
other officials stand by their pledges and
promises, tbe following few brief rules
may be useful.
If the invention necessitates a special
bottle consult a practical glass-blower as
to' the practicability of the design, and
again, if the extra cost reaches a couple of
cents over that of an ordinary bottle then
do the work over again and simplify it.
No contrivance of any kind of metal is
suitable. Metal however pure has a ten
dency to cloud the liquor and make it
unsalable. A strip of pure aluminum,
selected for its apparent fitness for such
purposes as valves, etc., in a bottle, was
deposited in a vial of good rye and at the
end of a month was found to resemble a
piece ot sea weed with long streamers.
The coloring matter in the whisky had
settled on the aluminum and the least dis
turbance stirred up a cloud of discolor
ations.
Glass and porcelain are, of course, not
subject to these objections, but the frailty
of the former and the thickness of the
latter are serious drawbacks to the use of
either. The flow of the liquor must not
be contracted to any great extent, for a
non-filling bottle which only gives lorth
its contents in driplcts would find no
favor in a saloon. Then, again, the size of
cork is an important factor, and its size
cannot be increased without materially
adding to the cost of the outfit; hence the
cork should remain the usual size. Sim
plicity rather than complication should be
aimed at, for in a bottling establishment
the fraction of a minute spent in inserting
the valve system adds to the cost of the
operation.
The favorite method by most inventors
in the non-filling bottle line is to use
marble balls, known as "commons," to act
as valves. They answer the purpose very
well while the bottle is in a perpendicular
position, but when inclined or placed up
side down there is no difficulty in refilling
an emptied bottle. It may even be filled
while in its normal position by a gentle
and rotary shaking.
One inventor got up a bottle which,
when empty, would collapse. It found no
favor, however, because of the possibility
of its bursting while some liquor still re
mained. Another devised a bottle, the
neck of which would break off at a line
with the bottom of the cork. Glass, how
ever, is somewhat erratic, and while ac
cording to theory it should in stipulated
cases break off where thinnest, in practice
it does not always do so, and the poor bar
keeper would be excused for refusing to
Handle such unreliable material. It was
not claimed for this bottle that it was non
fillable, except when it broke anywhere
below the assigned line, in which case
both liquor and bottle went into the slop
bucket. The idea was to indicate that the
bottle had been opened, but there was
nothing to prevent an enterprising mix
ologist from keeping this same bottle
filled for an indefinite period.

THE
STAGE
The din of the theatrical season in
reases. Announcement follows an-
nouncement. One of tbe Eastern dra
matic writers alleges that the "hard
times" are causing the managers and act
ors to get in their work early. The ban
ners handing on the outer walls tell which
way the theatrical procession will move
for many weeks to come. Actors who
have good engagements are envied by
those who have none, and there is a rush
to get in early. This is the substance of
what is told in a column perspiringly con
tributed to an Eastern journal when every
editorial-room was a "hot box" indeed,
with a temperature crowding "100 degrees
above."
So be it, if this proves to be the general
condition of affairs, while it may be bad
for the Thespians, the manager will have
no excuse for filling up his companies
with a substratum of sawdust and red
paint. The real, Simon pure actor ought
to be found in abundance in the lesser
number of companies to travel the cir
cuits. The patron of the box office will
revel in seeing the work brought upward
to the standard fixed by the popular un
derstanding of what nature and natural
acting mean. What is bad for the actor
may be good for the audience, if the man
agers have a chance to take their pick of
the talent. Probably, however, the East
ern writer has overstated the case.
All over the country the European
operatic starÃ are coming in for a gentle
"roast" for reasons heretofore alleged.
The public will watch with much curi
osity the outcome of the farce, which
might fairly be entitled "Wanted: Every
thing in Sight, or Nothing," according to
one view or the case.
But the more direct gaze of tbe public
will be fixed on the local stages in the im
mediate future. The attractions of a week
are mentioned below.
/U the Baldwin.
The second and last week of "The Gay
Parisians" is announced at the Baldwin.
The hit the farce made can best be told by
the enormous business it did and it looks
as if the second week will be fully as large.
The company is a remarkably good one
and reflects credit upon Manager Charles
Frohman. W. J. Ferguson, who made
an impression a long while since as Mor
timer, the valet in "Beau Brnmmell," is
always a comedian of the first considera
tion. In this play he is the gay Parisian
who takes the other man's pretty wife out
for the evening. His conception of the
character of the man, momentarily
prompted to do something risky in spite of
his own inclination to be henpecked, to
roll bacK twenty years of the past, eradi
cate his wife, who is an old bore, and
make a nisrnt of it, does not suggest a
caricature, as is usual, but a real bit of
amusing human nature. Mr. Ferguson
keeps the humor of the situations ricely
balanced between comedy and farce and
hi* playing is very enjoyable throughout.
As the wife, the personal attractions of
such a player as Sadie Martinot are in
keeping. Miss Martinot is well fitted to
appear at the head of such a clever com
pany of comedy artists. Her husband is
forcibly presented by Charles Wells. The
character of an old widower, who stutters
whenever the weather is damp, and who
besides has four young daughters dangling
about him, is enacted by a capital
peraonator of eccentric parts, James Bar
rows, who should be recalled in the char
acter of the old sergeant in "Shenandoah."
In his way Mr. Barrows is quite as finished
a comedian as Mr. Ferguson. He con
tributes a great deal of humor to several
situations in this play. It is he who holds
the clew to all the complications that seem
about to be revealed at the final climax;
but a thunder-storm gives him impedi
ment of speech at the critical moment.
This is a neat bit of invention on the part
of the playwrights. Mrs. E. J. Phillips
does some excellent work as the wife of the
advice-giver. Margaret Gordon plays the
French servant with a captivating chic,
and as a matter of fact, there is not a
badiy piayed character in tbe entire piece.
The last performance of "The Gay Pari
sians" will be given next Sunday night,
August 30.
Galifomia Jheater.
To-night at the California Theater the
public will see the last performance of
Chauncey Olcott's prosperous engagement
at that popular theater. The bill for to
night will be "The Minstrel of Clare," the
same that has been entertaining audiences
during the past week at that well-known
playhouse. The performance is one that
offers an unusual amount of enjoyment
for lovers of this class of drama.
After a closure of two weeks, beginning
with to-morrow night the California The
ater will offer a decidedly novel and suc
cessful melodramatic production, "On the
Bowery," which will bring out as the cen
tral figure of many exciting and thrilling
incidents the famous Steve Brodie. Be
sides fioing that it sets forth an exciting
sensational story and contains a number
of most amusing character studies.
Some of the scenes are not only very
handsome but also quite different in de
scription from any ever shown with any
other piay. The saloon scene is unique
by reason of the oeculiar decorations of
Brodie's place on tbe Bowery. The Brook
lyn bridge scene is a novelty. The spec
tator seems to look along 800 feet of a
northern driveway. This effect was ob
tained by the scenic artist, John H.
Young. The pier scene, with the ware
house, watchbouse and shipping, also is
quite unlike any stage wharf scene. The
second act, which is almost as long as all
trie other acts put together, is a series of
laughable scenes in Steve Brodie's Bow
ery refreshment resort. As many funny
things as might occur in the real saloon
in a month are compressed in this single
act.
The Columbia Jheater.
"The Social Trust" will have its first
production on any stage at the Columbia
Theater to-morrow evening. "The Social
Trust" is a new play written especially for
the Frawley Company by the two well
known authors, Hillary Bell and Ramsay
Morris. It is a comedy-drama, the story
of which is founded upon the incidents
connected with the famous Cordage Trust.
The play will have the advantage of inter
pretation at the hands of the Frawley
Company, including Wilton Lackaye,
Mrs. Thorndyke Boucicault, Miss Blanche
L. Bates and all of the important mem
bers of the Frawley Company, including
the reaDpearance of T. Daniel Frawley
himself. For this production special
scenery and stage effects have been got
up, and it is not unlikely that following
the present engagement the play will be
taken to New York City for a run.
The drama is replete with incidents.
The main spring of action is the marriage
of Frederick Brewster to Lillian Cornell.
He is a New Yorker of social posi
tiop and is the head of the Cordage Trust.
He married Lillian because it is necessary
to raise money to carry on his schemes,
although he is in love with Mr?. Hallock,
wife of the originator of the Cordage Trust,
and Lillian is in love with Charteris King,
a young author. The marriage is repugnant
to Lillian, of course. Brewster's financial
schemes fail and he tries to blackmail his
wife. He has already risKed her dowry.
There are striking scenes following
which include a quarrel between
the husband and wife over the
refusal of the latter to attend Mrs. Hal
lock's ball. The last act occurs in Brew
ster's lihrary, at 1 a. m., directly after the
ball. It shows his frantic endeavors to
force money from Airs. Morton, his wife's
aunt, through an attempt at blackmailing
his wife's character. Mrs. Morton stands
firm, refusing to believe ill of Lillian. Mrs.
Nelson, ttie one person who can sustain
his charge, and who knows that Lillian is
innocent, although she unwittingly fell
into the trap laid for her, is dragged
into the scene. After much diplomatic
hedging and equivocating she finally,
when pinned down, utters a deliberate lie
and saves Lillian. Almost at the same mo
ment Hallock discovers a note written by
his wife to Brewster, and mad with jeal
ousy and rage he shoots the latter dead.
Qrarvd Opera-|louse.
The attraction at Morosco's Grand
Opera-house during the coming week will
be "A Nutmeg Match." This is a charac
ter stody of rural life in Connecticut.
There are striking incidents in the four
acts, which include an attempted murder
by means of a piledriver which is averted
by the opportune arrival of the heroine.
A piledriver, operated by a regular steam
engine, is on the stage. The play has been
produced in this City before, so that the
story is familiar to all theater-goers. The
author is William Haworth, who wrote
"The Ensign." The stars of the cast will
be Lottie Williams, soubrette; Edward J.
Heron, low comedian.' The Grand Opera
house has been doing a fine business dur
ing the past week. In "A Nutmeg Match"
Lottie Williams takes the role ol Cinders,
and Mr. Heron will be George Washing
ton Littleoales.
JiVoli Opera-House.
The eighth week of tne season of Eng
lish and Italian grand opera at the Tivoli
Opera-house will be devoted on Monday,
Wednesday, Friday and Sunday evenings
to elaborate presentations of Verdi's lyric
drama in four acts founded upon the
younger Dumas' celebrated story, "La
Dame anx Camellias," well known in
English as the emotional story and drama
of "Camille." Jn the role of Violetta
Valery Mme. Natali scored a great

triumph both in Europe and this country.
Bhe has fully recovered the use of her
splendid voice and will doubtless duplicate
her great success in "11 Trovatorc."
Signor Michelena will sine his favorite role
of Alfred Gerrnont; Signor Maurice de
Vries, the noble role of Georges Germont,
his father. The remaining roles will be in
eood nands.
On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday
evenings Mascagni's celebrated drama in
two acts, "Cavalleria Rusticana," will be
rendered, preceded by the balcony and
marriage scenes from "Romeo and Jnliet.' '
The cast from "Cavaileria Rusticana" will
include Nina Bertini Humphreys as San-
tuzza. Martin Pache as Turridu, Bernice
Holmes as Mamma Lucia, and John J.
Raffael as Alfio, the carrier. This will be
preceded by the balcony and marriage
scenes of "Romeo and Juliet," with Signor
Fernando Micheienaas Romeo and Signor
Abramoff as Friar Lawrence, and Nina
Bertini Humphreys as Juliet. For the
ninth week, by special request, "Rigo
letto" will be given with Signor M. de
Vries as the jester; also Verdi's historical
opera "Ernani." Great preparations are
being made for a scenic revival of Verdi's
"Aida."
y\t the Orpheum.
Another great bill of vaudeville stars and
novelties is announced at the Orpheum
for this week. It is some time since a ma
gician has been seen in the Orpheum or in
the City, for that matter. One of the most
clever of such on the vaudeville stage has
been secured. Albini was seen -here years
ago and was counted as exceptionally
clever at that time. He has just com
pleted a tour of the world and he returns
loaded with paraphernalia, ideas and won
ders. Mr. Albini is tne inventor of all the
tricks that he performs. Newspapers and
magazines have given a great deal of
space to accounts of the mysteries of In
dia, occultism, hypnotism and the mar
vels of magic. Albini devotes his time to
the marvels of magic and East Indian
mysteries and gives a most pleasing enter
tainment.
Richard Pitrot, an excellent mimic, will
appear in impersonations. He is a wonder
ful facial artist. It is expected that he
will make even a bigger hit this time at
I the Orpheum than he did a few years ago
lat the Bush-street Theater. Miss Nellie
! Maeuire will appear in character songs.
| Favor dfc Sinclair, who made such a hit last
j week, have some new things to tell and
sing about. Mr. Favor will, however, con
tinue to sing "Girl Wanted," the song
that has won him so many encores. The
bill will also include Mildred Howard, the
! Trilby dancer; Sydney de Gray, Herr
j Techow's trained cats, the Nelson Sisters
j and others, including Biondi, who remains
j for one week more, but this will positively
[be his. last appearance fri this City. He
l has been one of the greatest drawing cards
that the Orpheum has ever had. The new
Wein-Stube open? this week, and promises
| to be popular as an annex to the Orpheum.
Matinees on every Wednesday, Saturday
and Sunday.
J\t the Alcazar.
The Alcazar Theater, under the new
management of Belasco, Doane & Jordan,
opens to the public Monday, August 31.
The opening production will be Nat Good
win's laughable comedy, "Turned Up."
The cast, with the exception of the lead
ing man, is as follows: Amy Lee, Adele
Belgarde, Miss May Buckley, Miss F. M.
Bates, Mrs. Henry Vanderhoff, Hattie
Foley, Rosella La Faille, Frank Doane.
J. B. Polk, F. B. Clayton, Richardson
Cotton, Carl Smith, W. A. Belasco.
At the GKutes.
Every novelty obtainable is constantly
presented at the Chutes on Haight street
and the grounds are full of life every after
j noon and evening. The scenic railway,
trolley, chutes, merry-go-round and other
I nerve-freshening devices are constantly in
i operation. "Joe Storms," the only orang
| outang in America, will be seen for the
| last time here to-day.
At 4:30 o'clock this afternoon Emil
Markeberg, who is without doubt the most
daring aeronaut on earth, will make an
other balloon ascension and parachute
drop. Last Sunday he went up with bis
I balloon on fire, effected a safe landing and
I helped extinguish his blazing airship
when it got back to the ground.
Performances are given at the Casino
every evening and Saturday and Sunday
afternoons. The bill for the ensuing
week will include the De Fiilipis, whirl
wind dancers; a Japanese conjurer and a
troupe of Japanese acrobats, Grace LeÂ«
nore, a girl cornetist, and vocalists and
character impersonators.
Notes From fi\\ Quarters.
Maggie Cline will bring out her new
piece, "On Broadway," for a tour of the
coast.
"The Prisoner of Zenda" will make its
first tour of the country this coming sea
son. It will be seen at the Baldwin Octo
ber 5. Jumes K. Hackett and Isabel Irv
ing are in the cast.
"The Foundling," with Cissy Fitzgerald
at the head of the company, will come to
the coast this season.
There is to be a regular performance of
,"The Gay Parisians" at the Baldwin Thea
ter to-night (Sunday).
"The Gay Parisians," under the title of
"A Night Out," still continues to crowd
the Vaudeville Theater, London.
Miss Rose Adler will be tendered a fare
well testimonial on August 15, prior toner
departure for the Berlin Operatic School.
Georgia Cay van has begun rehearsals at
Palmer's Theater in New York City for
her starring tour, which begins on Octo
ber 3.
The great Lyceum Theater success,
"The Wife," will be the next play at the
Columbia Theater, to follow "The Social
Trust."
The most elaborate preparations are
being made scenically for "The Social
Trust," which is to be given for the first
time upon the stage at the Columbia
Theater.
"Trilby" is still booming in Australia.
Jennie Reiffarth's Madame Vinard is pro
nounced the best of old-woman acting that
has been seen on the Australian stage in a
long time.
A large number of tickets are being dis
posed of by Court Golden State No. 22, F.
of A., for their benefit nights, on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday next, at tha
Columbia Theater.
The entire tour of "Chimmie Fadden"
will be under the management of Messrs.
Fried lander, Gottlob & Co., of the Colum

est manifested in its performance here.
E. M. and Joseph Holland entertained
Henry Guy Carleton at Quisett, Cape
Cod, last week, where they listened to
"Two Men of Business," the new play
which Mr. Carleton has writteu for them.
A special department of instruction in
operatic acting will be added to the Co
lumbia Theater School of Dramatic Art,

of instructors.
Sutton Vane's great play "Homanity,"
"The Cotton King" and "Old Glory," a
comedy-drama new to the coast, will all be
presented here by William A. Brady, in
cluding Joseph Grismer and Phoebe Davies,
at the Columbia Theater.
Robert Hilliard will not present his new
comedy, "The Mummy," at the outset of
his season, but will produce it some time
along in the early part of next year. He
will open his season in his great success,
"Lost â Twenty-four Hours."
The interest in New York regarding the
early appearance of the Mapleson Opera
Company in that city is said to be most
unusual. The colonel has secured an array
of taJent for his company and the reper
toire which he intends to present will con
tain some decided novelties.
Thirteen young ladies and gentlemen of
the Columbia Theater School of Dramatic
Art assisted in the performance of the
"Masqueraders' 1 last week with Charles
Frohman's Empire Theater Stock Com
pany. One oi the graduates, James Keane,
played a small part effectively.

of the prologue is in Catherine's laundry
in Paris during the French revoiuiion.
The street without is filled with skurrying
soldiers and revolutionists. Catnerine is
engaged to Lefebre, who is a sergeant in
the nrmy, and one of her customers is Na
poleon, who is obliged to ask Catherine
for credit. Nineteeiryears elapse between
the first art, and Napoleon is then at the
height of his power. His sisters become
angry at Mme. Lefebre and ti e Empe
ror orders her husband to divorce her.
She pleads ncr own cause so weil that she
secures a high p ace in Napoleon's favor.
Kathryn K.idaer essays the part of Cathe
rine Hubscher and Augustus Cook is the
Napoleon. The<.;>sland thestajre settings
are the same as in v:" original production.
The popular tragedian, Frederick Warde,
goes East this week and will commence
his next season at Richmond, Va., on the
21st of September. He intends to make
"King Lear" the principal play of his
repertoire, and will present it on a most
elaborate scale, entirely in Keeping with
his usual manner of giving com Dlete pro
ductions. Later in the season he will
bring out for the first time his new
romantic play entitled, "The Rise of
Iskander."
The dramatic recital given at San Lean
dro by Miss Retena Helen Owens, assisted
by Mrs. Eva Wren, Edward Thornton and
Miss A. Mabel Hassey, was a success of
great merit. Miss Owens won the audi- i
ence by her natural grace and manner.
Her ability as a dramatic reader was
shown in her rendition of "Hagar" by
Nicholson. Her other numbers, including
Merrill's "Soul of the Violin," wer.; well
received. Tne musical numbers given
were good.
In relating her experiences with Euro
pean audiences, Mme. Bloomfield Zeisler
says: "Those ol the far north and the
far south are warm, appreciative and
demonstrative. In the midiile portion of
the country they are calm and temperate.
But everywhere they are more demon
strative than American audiences. It, is
harder to make a big success in America
than tnere. If people are acknowledged
here, they are sure of it there."
Sydney Chidley of Morosco's Grand
Opera-house, the corresponding secretary
for California of the Protective Alliance of
Scenic Painters, has received intimation
from the president of the alliance that the
National Alliance of Theatrical Siage Em
ployes have passed at their convention at
Detroit a resolution that after the first of
January next no scenery will be handled
unless painted by a member of the al
liance.

CANNED SALMON,
The circular of the Cutting Packing Company
says of canned saimon: "The se son of packing
spring run of fish on the Columbia River closed
the 10th lost., and although during the last days
of July the run had been small a large quantity of
ft'sh came in early Aucust, with the result of
bringing the volume of the pack up to approxi
mately 440,000 cases The fish kept op In size
ano quality to theemi of the season, and so plenti
ful were they that some fishermen were willing
snil anxious to *01l their catches a; less than regu
lation prices of 4% cen:s per pound. The present,
pack <'f Columbia River fish is irom high-priceii
material and to make the calmer w holt the canned
articl â  should command afairly cood price.
"From Alasnii the news is meager, but that
received indicates that packing is progressing in
a favorable manner and that volume of same
shou:d be about as usual. No new sulmoii from
that sectiun can b- loosed for until next month.
The demand hai been good for this variety of fish,
and so much of the pa: k has been placed in ad
vance of receipt that ideas of holder* are very
firm, and prices"have been advanced on some
favoiite brands.
"British Columbia is stlil packinc, and although
the ou.look on the Frazer River was discouraging
In the extreme, this last week has quite changed
the aspect, and a pood supply of lisa is now in
sir ht and packers are encouraged to hope that It
will continue to the close of the season."

CHICAGO, ttt-. Aug. 22.â The early part of
the half session of the grain markets to-day was
not enlivened by any occurrence of more than ordi
nary Import. Prices of wheat were higher, the
early buying being principally' for short recount.
The inducement to buy was mainly attributable to
smaller. Argentine shipments for the weekâ24,
--000 bushels, higher Liverpool cables: fair exports
from both coasts for the weekâ 2,991.698 bushels
â and 'â¢ to a reported foreign demand at the sea
board. Receipts at Chicago, were 180 cars, and
92.850 bushels we're withdrawn from store. ThÂ«
Northwest received 433 cars against 536 last year.
The closing Con tin ental cables proved themselves
of great importance as a bull factor.
.Berlin quotations were 3 to 33 /4 marks higher
and their posting was the signal for some quick,
work by shorts, who bought freely and whose pur
chases quickly rushed prices lc higher than they
were when the spurt began. Closing Paris cables
were 40 to 45 centimes higher for flour and un
changed to 5 centimes higher for wheat. Antwerp
wax unchanged. Kxport clearances amounted to
3-9,819 bushels. December wheat opened irom
69Â»4@595/BC. sold between 69% c and 613/sc. clos
ing at t>U.4@6l3/ B e, 2@2*4c under yesterday.
Estimated receipts for Mond ay 125 cars.
CORNâ Did not depart from its traditional in
activity and features were entirely aosent from
me trade. The only influence on prices was de
rived from the tone of wheat, and as that was
strong corn advanced. Receipts were 692 cars,
and 621,783 bushels were taken from store.' Liver
pool cables were s.eady. Export clearances were
240.462 bushels. May corn opened from 2tj%c to
2 . c. sold at 2 i 34c, Closing at 26 %'Â»c to 27c, a suade
higher than yesterday. Estimated receipts fur
Monday, 480 cars.
OATSâ Trading was restricted to very narrow
limits, probably more from the usual bait holiday
Indisposition to do business than from any other
cause. Receipts were 290 can, and 36,382 bushels
were withdrawn from store. May oats closed a
shade higher (ban yesterday. Estimated receipts
for Monday 330 cars. â  . " â

PROVISIONSâ slightly reduced in price
through the detrimental effect of a weaker hog
market. ' Trading was fairly active. The packers
were on both sides of the market to a limited ex
tent, but professionals took only a lukewarm in
terest. A slight hardening of the tone in sym
pathy with the bulge in wheat took place at the
close. '. January pork closed 2%c higher, January

Mr*. Hetty Green in Politics.
"Her whole nature has been revolution
ized," said a Washington hotel-keeper,
speaJcing of Mrs. Hetty Green's reported
intention of spending $1,000,000. or M so
much thereof as may be necessary," to
elect her son Governor of Texas.
"I never knew anybody to loosen up as
Mrs. Green baa of late, continued the
boniface. "About eighteen months ago
when she came on here atoe haggled with
me over the price of one of the cheapest
rooms in the house, and actually made
me give her a reduction because she staid
a week. The next time she came she had
on the finest sort of a dress, such a one as
nobody had seen her wear, and this time
my house was not good enough for her. so
s c went to the highest-priced place in
town and never asked the rat*. Her lib
eral streak was Jate in developing, but if
her son does go into politics it will be a
fortunate thing for him that his mother
chanced her system in the way of things
pecuniary."
Effect of the African Climate.
ft must ba fully recognized that the
Matabele murders of unarmed whites,
merely because they are whites, put them
almost out of the pale of mercy, and that
the absence among them of any leader
who can anawer for their conduct makes
general arrangements for peace exceed
ingly difficult.
At the same time we regret, if only on
grounds of policy, to see the temper of the
white settlers hardening, to notice a cer
tain readiness to execute as well as to slay
in fighting, and. to read exultine expres
sions as to the number killed. We do not
want dead bodies in Rhodesia, but quiet
subjects who wiU work for wages and ulti
mately become taxpayers. Lenity is good
policy in Africa as well as Asia, but it is
very seldom tbat it is displayed on the for
mer continent.
Something in tba climate or the sur
roundings seems to make all Europeans â
Germans, Dutchmen, Portuguese, and even
Englishmenâ abnormally nard.â London

Inspector to Be In

LARGE DEPOSITS MADE
The Accused Man Said to Have

NUMBER OF CHINESE LANDED
Nearly Sixteen Hundred Sought Ad.
mission Here During the Last
Fiscal Year.
The landing of Chinese at the port of
San Francisco during the fiscal year end
ing June 30 will probably cut an import
ant figure in tbe trial of Dick Williams,
now in progress in the United States Dis
trict Court.
While it is generally adm itted that more
natives of the FJowery Kingdom have
come into this country than are legally
entitled to such privilege, the magnitude
of tbe business has never been fully .ap
preciated. While there are none who are
willing to say that Collector Wise is even
remotely responsible for this condition of
affairs, there are many who believe that
he has relied too much on the honesty of
those under him.
During the twelve months ending June
30 no less than 2445 Celestials arrived at
tne port of San Francisco from foreign
countries. Of this number Btil simply
passed through the United States en route
to other countries. Of the remainder, 1337
males and 105 females were admitted,
leaving a fraction over 6 per cent, or, to be
exact, 102, wno were refused a landing.
Daring this same period Commissioner
Heacock heard only thirty-two habeas
corpus cases, as against many times that
number in years past. Since July 1, how
ever, the Commissioner's business has
shown a marked appreciation, seven cases
being heard in July alone.
Some weeks ago Collector Wise refused
to give for publication the number of
Chinese landed at this port for the period
quoted above or for the year ceas
ing January 1, 189 C. From unofficial
sources tbe Jast was learned to be 1 118,
and now from Washington comes the
figures already named.
,It is understood that the Government
proposes to introduce this evidence if such
a thing is possible. Not that they hope
to implicate Williams in all the illegal
business that has been done, but simply
to show that during his term in office
more Chinese landed at this port than
ever before.
As a kind of clincher to this argument
the prosecution will attempt to prove that
within sixty days of Williams going into
office he opened a bank account which
finally swelled well into the thousands.
It is contended that when the ex-inspector
received his appointment he was a
financial wreck and found it necessary to
borrow $50, which sum he immediately
placed on bis back in the shape of a suit
of clothes.
Some weeks later Williams astonished
and somewhat amazed his friends by ap
pearing on duty bedecked with a diamond
stud, the rays of which out-glittered any
thing before displayed in Federal circles.
This gem of nature, polished and re
splendent, was generally supposed to be a
eif t from that famous Chinese character
known as " Little Pete" â a fact which
Williams never denied.
Be that as it may, Williams had hardly
gotten comfortably ensconced in office be
fore he opened a bank account. His first
deposit was $300, and this was followed
regularly by other sums of money varying
from the amount named to $800." The ac
count, however, was in tne name of " Mrs.
R. S. Williams," and when it became
necessary to draw any funds from the
bank the wife acted as tbe go-between.
Mrs. Williams made all deposits and
signed all checks, that is until the recent
suit for divorce was entered.
In all something like $7800 was placed in
the bank by Williams during bis official
existence. The prosecution claims to be
able to prove that the ex-interpreter has
also purchased property nn the outside to
the extent of probably $15,000. The prin
cipal contention of tbe Government is that
this amount of property and money could
not have been legitimately obtained
during the short time Williams was in
office. This position is strongly empha
sized when it is known that the ex-in
spector received only $150 per month.
There is one man, however, who does
not take any stock in the claims set up by
the prosecution. This is no less a person
than Collector Wise. He declared a few
days ago that all such talk was nonsense.
"Williams told me himself," said the
Collector, "that when be went into office
he was worth $11,000. This had come to
him through either his father or his grand
parents, lam not sure just which. I have
no reason to doubt this statement, because
I always found Williams a capable and
honest man. If he has done wrong then
be should be punished, but I am inclined
to think he is being persecuted."
In the meantime the Government is
pushing its case for all there is in it. One
of tbe strongest cards remains to be
played. It is nothing less than the bank
book of Williams, showing that the de
posits followed close on the arrival of each
steamer from the Orient. This may mean
much or nothing, but tbe prosecution has
an abiding faith in its effectiveness.
BUCKMAN MUST MOVE,
Health Officer Dr. A. S. Lovelace
Suddenly Changes His
Mind.
A Delegation of Voters Calls on 'Him
at tbe City Hall and
Protests.
Within ten minutes after a delegation of
voters bad visited the office of the Board
of Health yesterday morning Health
Officer Lovelace had experienced a change
of heart regarding A. E. Buckman's grad
ing camp, that has been the cause of so
much controversy of late, and the hopes
of the contractor to remain unmolested in
his present locution went a-glimmering.
On Friday evening, after the board bad
left the matter of deciding the fate of the
camp entirely in his hands, Dr. Lovelace
announced positively that he had visited
the camp, had noted the efforts to make
the place sanitary and tit for habitation,
and was perfectly satisfied to allow Mr.
Buckman to remain where he is. Yesterday
morning at 10 o'clock he was still in the
same frame of mind, but within an hour
of that time a change had come over the
spirit of his dream.
Aroused by the publication in The Call
of Dr. Lovelace's intention of allowing
Buckman to maintain his camp a large
number of property-owners called at the
Health Office, and the Health Officer spent
an exceedingly uncomfortable half hour
in their company.
They called his attention to the pre
vious action of the board in condemning
the camp and demanded that the measure
be carried out. He was warned that they
were voters and that the wrath of the
neighborhood of the camp would fall on
the board if Buckman was not forced to
move.
The last member of the delegation was
hardly out of tbe office when the services
of tbe office telephone were called into
play and consultations with the various
members of the board were held. The re
sult was that the following letter was dis
patched to Mr. Buckman during the after
noon:
San Francisco, Aug. 22, 1896.
A. E. Buckman Esq., City.â Dear Sir: At a
meeting of the Board of Health, held on the
20tn day of August, the matter of the "Buck
man camp" was referred to me. I have re
ported to the Board of Health, that I have
again thoroughly examined and inspected the
camp.
I find that, while considerable work in the
way of cleaning up has been done and that
you have promised to do any other work in
the way of sanitary reform that I may suggest,
I am still of the opinion that it would be im
possible to place the camp in a sanitary condi
tion and keep it so, as long as the premises are
occupied ana used for the purposes they are
used now.
I am instructed by the Board of Health to re
affirm their former order that the place be
vacated and that this order be complied with
within four days from the receipt of this no
tice, fiespectf ully yours,
Arthur S. Lovelace, M.D., Health Officer.
Mr. Buckman's answer had not been re
ceived at the Health Office up to closing
hour. ________________
MM E. SANS GENE ARRIVES
Miss Kathryn Kidder and Com
pany Get Here From New
York.
The Talented Actress Talks of Her
Conception of Sardou's Napoleonic
Play.
Quite an array of dramatic talent came
into town last evening with the ar
rival of Augustus Pitou's "Madame Sans
Gene" company, direct from New York,
from which place the organization started
last Monday afternoon.
The star of the company is MisSiKathryn
Kidder, who, in the face of all th 4 compe
tition which necessarily makes "for Sar
dou's plays, secured the English rights of
"Madame Sans Gene" and brought it out
handsomely under the direction of Au
gustus Pitou.
"I had always bad ambitions beyond
the stereotyped progress of an actress,"
said Miss Kidder. brightly. "I wanted to
do something whicb would be different
from the rest. Well, I saw 'Madame Sans
Gene' in manuscript and was delighted.
I saw â or imagined that I saw â a great
success in it. It was a French historical
play and I intended taking it to a country
where French is not spoken and where
foreign history is not of paramount inter
est. But â well, you'll see."
"How about the translation.?"
"Ob, that was very hard, indeed," said
Miss Kidder. "You would scarcely credit
the difficulty of making a translation
whicb should convey the 'atmosphere' of
the French words. Translation after
translation was tried and notably one by
Clyde Fitch, which wouldn't do at all. I
At last Mr. Meltzer, a New York journal- !
ist. made the one which we are using."
Kathryn Kidder has a felicitous name,
and she is a woman of versatility. Had
she not chosen the stage she might have
filled the rostrum, for Mine. Sans Gene
herself is no more ready of speech than
she. Then, with her height, she need
never have troubled to climb to the top of
the ladderâ she could simply reach up
and take things off.
Besides Miss Kidder, the organization
which arrived last evening includes:
Augustus Cook, Harold Russell, Wallace
Shaw, Willis Granger, James Cooper,
Charles W. Btokes, Charles Plunkett, T.
J. McGrane, W. H. Creighton, Frank Ab
bott, Charles Wilton, Frank J. Pierson,
Frederick Webster, R. 8. Button, John R.
Stevenson, Charlea Smythe, James P.
Deuel, Thomas Martin, Richard Malchien,
George Brennan, Mark Ellsworth, Horace
Vincent, Edward Howard, George Brown,
Vincent Savage, James Allen, Florence
Lincoln, Catherine Campbell, Judith
Muse, Louise Draper, Virginia Stoddard,
Mary A. Houston, Fanny Bart, Dora
Webb, Alice Watson, Annie Howard,
Adelaide Piunkett, Christine Hill, Ruth
Oliver.
Three carloads of stage fittings came
across the continent with tbe players.
BACK FROM THE EAST,
Rev. Anna Shaw's Return From
Her Lecturing Tour in
the States.
She Is Glad to Get Away From the
Heat and Resume Her Work
in California.
The Rev. Anna Snaw arrived on Friday
by the overland train after a most success
ful lecturing tour of nearly a month in
the States. A little army of friends met
her at the Sixteenth-street station in Oak
land, while the wharf on this side of the
bay was the scene of a most cordial
demonstration.
"I have been hard at work ever since I
left here," said she as soon as she could

Everywhere I was asked bow the woman

"The hopes and prayers of hundreds* of
thousands of women in the States seem to
be bound up in California's attitude upon
the woman-suffrage issue. lam glad to
get back out ot the heat, which made me
suffer considerably during my trip. I
cannot hope to get away from work, how
ever; bnt then, it is a pleasure to labor
here in California, where press and people
are more kindly disposed toward our
cause than in any other place that I have
visited.
"Many people asked me what I thought
of California, seeming to know very little
about this garden spot of the Union. I
told them all that California was paradise
with woman suffrage left out."
Republican clubs throughout the
State are taking much interest in the
women suffrage plank in the party plat
form. A letter from far-north Siskiyou
County notes the encouraging fact that at
the Republican meetings in that section
the ablest and most eloquent orators are
making earnest appeals to voters, calling
upon them to do their best to secure the
passage of the proposed suffrage amend
ment to the State constitution.

TERRILL IS CHAMPION,
Defeats Jones in Clever Style at
the Central Park
Meet.
Fast Time and Close Finishes, Marred
by Two Bad Falls, Were
tbe Features.
The largest crowd that has assembled at
a cycle race meet in many a day congre
gated at the Central Park track yesterday
afternoon, and were well repaid for the
visit, for the racing was the fastest and
most exciting seen here in many a day.
The stands were packed with people, and,
with their enthusiasm and the cheering
influence of a six-piece band, which
played one tune over and over again, the
men rode with a vim and the finishes were
close and exciting.
George E. Dixon acted as announcer of
results, and his witty remarks kept the
spectators in a, constant uproar. As an
announcer he was an unqualified success.
The drawing card of the programme
was the match race at one mile, best two
in three heats, between W. A. Terrill, Bay
City Wheelmen, and Allen N. Jones,
Olympic Club Wheetmen. Considerable
betting had been indulged in between the
members of the two clubs, and the grounds
were filled with admirers of the two
riders.
The first heat in the match race was the
opening event on the programme. Jones
won the toss-up for position and took the
pole. Roma Dow of the Olympic Cyclers
paced for the first two laps, and made it
ratber slow. J. E. Edwards, Olympic
Wheelmen, made a pretty pick-up on the
third lap and livened up the pace a bit,
but it was never very fast He dropped
out on the fifth lap and left the champions
to fight it out by themselves, and they did
it with a will. Jones had the pole and
kept it, and looked all the way a winner,
but Terrill came fast and beat him out
half a wheel's length. The time was
2:213-5.
The second heat was even slower than
the first, but more interesting. The men
loafed for four laps, when Jones stole a
march on his opponent and got a consid
erable lead before Terrill could eet mov
ing. When he did, though, he came with
a big rush and the two fought it out down
the stretch. They crossed the line abreast,
and the judges declared it a dead heat, a
decision which was applauded. The time
was 2:31 1-5.
The race was decided in the next heat,
and Terrill proved himself the crack pro
fessional of the coast to-day, though it is
due to Jones to say that he put up a splen
did ride, and had he had the pole the re
sult might have been different. The sprint
was commenced at the end of the fifth lap,
and for a sixth of a mile the men fought
it out.
It was by all means tbe best sport of
the kind cycling devotees here have seen
in many a day. Terrill led to the tape,
and, though Jones jumped again and
again, he could not overtake him. Terrill
won in 2:40 1-5 amid deafening applause,
and was carried off the track on the
shoulders of his delighted clubmates.
The one-third of a mile scratch was run
in six heats and two semi-finals. There
was a tumble in the last heat, and
Languetin, Robinson and Welch went
down, but escaped with a few bruises. The
final was won by Percy Mott of Oakland,
a Reliance Club man, in clever style in
51 2-5 seconds. Kenna and Squires, Acme
Club, finished second and third respect
ively, close up.
The one-mile handicap, professional,
was run in two heats and a final. Dow
and Davis, Olympics, qualified in the first
heat, and Harry Terriil, Bay t'itys, made
an easy win ot the second, beating Ed
wards and Whitman, Olympics.
A bad tumble occurred in the final.
i Dow sprinted a lap too soon and got quite
I a lead, and, thinking he nad won the race,
! rode wide on the south bank, crowding
â  Terrill toward the rail. They collided
and Dow was the sufferer, being thrown
heavily to the track. This threw Terrill
out of his stride and the sprint was left to
Edwards and Davis, the latter winning
in 2:42.
The mile handicap, amateur, was de
cided in five preliminary heats and a final.
Those who qualified in their heats were:
C. D. Gooch, Reliance; W. J. Bell, Vi
salia; W. B. Plumb, Reliance; J. Hirsch,
Sacramento, and P. A. Deacon, Reliance.
Deacon won the final in good style in
2:31 2-5, closely pressed by Gooch and
Hirsch.
After the races J. S. Brereton of the Re
liance Club tried for the five-mile unpaced
amateur coast record. His time for the
intermediate miles was 2:28 2-5,5:051-5,
7:47 1-5, 10:29 2-5, 13:09 1-5.
This establishes a coast record for the
distance.
