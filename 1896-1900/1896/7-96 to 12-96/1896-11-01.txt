TOM REED
MAKES A HIT
A Discussion of Live Is
sues at Woodwards
Pavilion.
BOURBON ERRORS PUT TO
FLIGHT.
Samuel M. Shortridge Introduces
the Speaker to a Mul
titude.
f GREAT APPLAUSE AS POINTS
ABE SCORED.
Fitting Ending of a Glorious Day of
the Great Campaign for Pro
tection and Prosperity.
Hon. Thomas Brackett Reed, superb of
stature, oi ample proportions, magnificent
in intellect â Speaker T. B. Reed, tbe able,
masterful parliamentarian, the terror of
lawless Congressional bushwhackersâ Tom
Reed, the magnetic orator, eloquent, in
cisive and logical â Reed, the man of the
people and the well-loved champion of
honest money and American protection,
spoke to a listening world last night.
It is true that his utterances were de
livered primarily to a San Francisco audi
ence at Woodward's Pavilion, but the
wingea words were taken uv> by the elec
tric current and borne across the spread
ing continent, disseminated throughout
the centers of population anil thought in
his own dear native land, and still, not
halting for a moment, were wafted beneath
tbe billows of the wide Atlantic to the
readers of the habitable globe. '
Thomas Bracfcett Reed of Maine, Who Handled Democratic Obstructionists in Congress With Steel Gloves and Proved
Himself to Be the Right Man for an Emergency.
When these wise words of Mr. Reed are
presented to the readers of The Call, and
while the people are perusing these stately
periods, to replete with facts and teeming j
with indisputable, irrefutable arguments,
the peoples of every nation of the world
will be enjoying the same privilege.
Nor is the universal recognition of this
masterly effort undeserved. It is a speech
worthy of the man, the occasion and the
theme.
Never in the history of San Francisco
was there so great an audience assembled
to greet a great man. Never before was
there so much enthusiasm, never before
was there beard in this City such a storm
of cheers, never before did the American
flag wave over a more unanimous as
semblage of American citizens, who joined
their voices and their hearts ill willing
tributes to Wiliiaru McKinley, the stand
ard bearer of the Republican party, and
to Thomas B. Reed, the man of the Hour.
On the rostrum were a number of promi
nent citizens, including Major Frank Mc-
Laughlin, J. D. Spreckels, M. R. Hijjgins,
Samuel M. Shortridge, W. W. Montague,
l F. W. Van Sicklen, P. N. Lilienthal, W. M.
I Ranck, M. H. de Young and Charles M.
I Shortridge.
' The Knickerbocker Male Quartet, com
posed of Me.-srs. D M. Lawrence, C. M.
Elliott, D. B. Crane and L. A. Larsen, and
the California Male Quintet, composed of
Messrs. Booth, Preston, Smith, Gaee and
M*cÃean, joined forces and favored the
The San Francisco Call.
audience with some inspiring campaign
songs.
When Major McLaughlio, Chairman of
the Republican Stale Central Committee,
introduced Hon. Samuel M. Sbortridge as
the Chairman of the meeting, there was an
outburst of spontaneous applause which
for several moments interrupted farther
proceedings. Mr. Bnortridge's opening
sentence renewed and redoubled this en
thusiasm, for when he said that "San
Francisco is safe, California is safe and
the Union is safe for MoKinley," he
touched the keynote of the great universal
human heart throbbing to the music of
patriotism and enlightenment.
With a few well chosen words Mr.
Bhortrid K e gave the true text of the cam
paign and the evening. Mr. Shortridge
said:
"Fellow citizens: Ban Francisco is safe
lappiause], California Is safe [applause],
the Union is safe [great applause] for the
constitution and its supremacy, for the
law and its enforcement, for National
honor and its upholding, for National

great and soldier-statesman leader, Wil

tinued applause ] imminent danger

"No! responded Vermont Nol thun

American people.
"Is there any doubt as to what San
Francisco and California will do next
Tuesday? [Answers of 'No, not one!']
"In this nour of the Nation's supreme
peril patriotism rises above par:y pride,
and with the cherished and triumphant
banner of their county- above them and a
deathless love of their country in their
hearts Californians have marcheJ to-day
and will vote on Tuesday for liberty under
law, lor iionest, sound and safe money,
for protection to American farms, Ameri
can factories and American fijesides.
[Applause.]
"This is a land of free men. Abraham
Lincoln â " here Mr. Shortridge was inter
rupted by a spontaneous outburst of ap
plause that lasted several minutes. When
all was quiet he continued: "Abraham
Lincoln died to make it free. No slave
crouches, no slave marches under the
American flag. Rich and poor, merchant
and mechanic, white and black, native
and foreign born stand erect, side by side,
under this emblem of liberty and union;
and as they have marched so will they
vote on Tuesday. [Continued applause.]
"This is one country [applause], and no

[Great applause.]
"California greets Maine to-night. I
have the honor to present to you the
Union's champion and defender, brave,

true-hearted, masterful Thomas B. Reed."
[Applause and continued cheering]
Mr. Reed could not have been more en
thusiastically received if he had really
been the Czar of all the Russias entering
the holy portals of the Kremlin on the
way to his own coronation. Cheer after
cheer rent th r air, flaea were waved to and
fro, the Oakland Alliance cave their war
cry that Reed is all right and McKinley
will be President, while the Plumed
Knights, the Phoen.x Club and the Bear
Club, who had escorted Mr. Reed and his
party to the ball, marc&ed and counter
marched with resounding music and with
Danners firing.
Wave after wave ol applause and cheer
ing swept over the vast audience, and it
was with difficulty that the happy feelings
of the audience could be curbed suffi
ciently to allow the speaker to proceed.
Just as the people appeared to be set
tling down a man in the rear of the house
shouted, "Mr. Reed, do you think you
have got a quorum?" and there was a
ripple of genuine laughter throughout the
crowd. Another slight diversion was
made by a man who called out for three
cheers for Mr. Bryan, but he was quickly
and quietly suppressed, and it being seen
that Mr. Reed was about to proceed, a
bush fell upon the people and the great
argument was begun. The vein of gentle
Irony which ran tnrough Mr. Reed's
speech, the aggressive logic that main
tained it throughout and the Attic salt
with which it was flavored proved pleas
ing to bis hearers.
Mr. Reed said:
Fellow-citizens, Ladies and Gentlemen: I
thank you most heartily for the kind way in
which you have greeted me.
The opposition newspapers have taken pains
to inform you that lam no orator. They need
not have taken pains to do it. You would
have found it out before I bad got through a
half dozen sentences. Consequently you will
not expect from me any of the flowers oi
rhetoric. I shall not juegle with their crowns
of thorns or crosses o: gold.
What I shall nave to say to you will be
plain and simple sense. [Shouts of "Good!
good!" from the audience. l
Perhaps to many minds my style of discus
sion may be better suited to the present con
dition of the people, because we are not now
involving ourselves in any discussion which
involves human liberty or which involves any
of those things about which long sentences
can be put out with much sound and very lit
tle meaning. What concerns us Is simply
everyday happiness â happiness which comes
of a well-filled larder and honestly furnished
house and a livelihood assured to us from day
to day.
The people of this country for the last four
years have been looking about them to see
what the causes are of what has so plainly and
visibly happened.
There are a great many methods of educa.
tion. There is school education, there is book
education, there is college education, but the
best education in this world is the education
which comes of experience. \'ou can buy
book education and college education at a
very cheap price, but the education which
comes of experience you have got to pay a
high price for, and for the lasi four years yon
have been paying the highest pr.ee that was
ever paid in the history of this country. But
It is the price of your own folly. Nobody car.

THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND MEN

LARGEST TURNOUT EVER

One Hundred Thousand People
Cheered the Legions of

GOLDEN CHRYSANTHEMUMS
BLOOMED BESIDE THE FLAG.
Honest Workingmen Demand the Honest Dollar
and Protection for Products Made
at Home.
Yesterday's monster procession was im
pressive as the earnest voice of thousands
in acclaim for a just cause, and the parade
itself was as beautiful a movement for lib
erty as was ever witnessed on American
soil,, an orderly, yet enthusiastic protest
against the party of shadows and an ear
nest turning toward the light.
To the most casual observer the im
pressive feature was the absence of p&rty
bitterness and the presence of evidences
that thousands of citizens can cast asiue
party for country when the flag of their
native land is assailed by the hosts of
error.
Thousands of Democrats were in line,
marching shoulder to shoulder with men
whom they had foupht on political battle
fields for a lifetime â united at last in the
glorious fight for National honor and the
general welfare of the people.
The procession was nothing less than a
spontaneous outpouring of the lovers of â¢
liberty irrespective of party. Men of a'l
ranks and conditions in life were in the
lines, employer with employe, capitalist
with laborer, protectionist with free
traderâall in accord on the one proposi
tion that the election of McKinley and
Hobart is the common duty of patriots
this year.
From every quarter of the City, and
from scores of cities and towns adjacent,
citizens sent representatives to cheer the
caube of progress and to witness the most
imposing parade ever seen in California.
When uniformed buglers and musicians
poured forth tne melodies of old, patriotic
airs they touched a responsive chord in
the hearts of the thousands who marched
and of thousands more who watched.
As the legions passed, hour after hour,
brave men and gentle women cheered the
band and drum corps and divisions of
patriotic marchers, rejoiced when the
voices of silver-throated buglers awoke the
City and stirred patriotism as in the days
of old.
Before noon the City wss astir, aa if
moved by some strange spell, and two
hours later the streets were lined with
countless thousands, while every window
and balcony was alive with human inter
est.
By 2 o'clock the clotids that threatened
an hour before had melted, so that the
buglers and blowers of horns and beaters
of drums stood confidently and faced the
purpling slcy, wafting to the anxious ears
of expectant thousands and in tri
umphant notes a message of peace and
good-will to patriots everywhere.
There were cheers as the eyes of thou
sands viewed the Hags of coming battal
ions of brave marchers for the right.
Then came a muffled sound of feet. Flags,
which had drooped listlessly in the morn
ing rain, undulated proudly in the breeze.
Then came a crash of trumpets; rifts of !
gleaming banners; colors dip and rise;
the streets echo to the tramp of steed and
men and sound of marching bands. Thir
ty-five thousand men in badges marched
behind banners, all carrying flags, all
wearing badges. Within the City 100,000
citizens debouched upon the streets, a
countless throng invading every available
view - point for miles. Thousands of
guests were stirring, too, to chper as in
spiring strains of music echoed through
the streets. The City was a wilderness of
banners and flags, the October sky, aflame
with blue and golden tints, brooding over
all.
Amid these stirring scenes but two
names were spoken. Only two names
were inscribed upon the banners of the
men of ail beliefs who marched for their
country. Those names were McKinley
'and HobarU symbols of prosperity. Those
names and the sentiment they stand for
were blazoned high upon the floats and
echoed in the tramp of thousands, voiced
alike in the rumbling of chariot wheels
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
and in the footsteps of laborers who
marched to show that they want honest
pay for honest work that they may pros
per and that National honor be pre
served.
Democrats and Republicans alike agree
that such a demonstration as yesterday's
parade for McKinley and Hobart was
never seen in the Golden West, and the
memory of the legions of patriot* with
nags ana banners will live in the minds of
thousands long after other memories
have passed away.
A GOLDEN SMILE.
How the Parade Appeared From tha
Crowded Housetops.
ban Francisco smiled yesterday when
she saw 35,000 McKinley voters in line,
and her smilu was eolden.
Not being the season for the poppies of
California, which also are golden, the
mammoth yellow chrysanthemum was the
flower of toe parade. Most of the men
who marched over the rough and uneven
pavement of Market street, one of the
finest and most poorly paved thorough
fares in the United States, wore the yellow
flower as a buttonhole bouquet all by it
self, so that the line of march was lighted
up with a golden glow.
There was also a great demand for the
beautiful flower on tbe part of thousands
who did not take part in the parade. The
Italian boys who make Lotta's Fountain,
in the very heart of the bustle ana roar of
the business center, a garden spot with
big baskets of flowers in the depth of win
ter to the delight ana surprise of tourists,
disposed of every yellow flower they had

an hour before the 1 start, and were obliged j
to hire wagons to replenish their stock j
from time to time during the remainder
of the afternoon.
Women displayed the McKinley colors,
the colors of the honest dollar for the
honest working man, with pride. They
wore the big flowers as corsage bouq lets
and a large proportion carried two and
three and four of the fairest blooms of the
gardens of Japan, albeit the smallest
chrysanthemum in the loi was large
enough to serve lor a matinee bonnet.
Here and there in the turbulent sea of
yellow could be seen a lone white flower
of the same variety, a poor little pieco of
flotsam from the Bryan wreck. They were
so few that whenever encountered they at
once invited the attention because of
their scarcity. \
The invasion for the popular hue was
not confined to the vegetable kingdom,
for it appeared in neckties, ribbons, bat
bands and feathers. If, as has been |
charged by that whimsical and erratic
organ of the Democracy, the Examiner,
the is was any coercion in the parade,
there certainly conld not have been any
on the sidewalks among the non-paraders,
men and women, who wore the sound
money and protection colors as liberally
as these were worn in the procession. The
adherents of Bryan seemed to have lost
heart, and the silver badges were so rare
as to be the subject of general comment.
A cool, damp, cloudy morning, whetting
the desire of the bibulous for a hot punch
with plenty of alcohol in it, was not a
very propitious forerunner for a big turn
out. All the visible indications were for
rain, and overcoats, umbrellas and rubber
overshoes were generally in demand. On
that account the early hours of the fore
noon were fraught with anxiety. Should
it rain, the procession would be a limp,
bedraggled failure, disgusted even with
itself, and as San Francisco's inhabitants
are credited with that quantity and qual
ity of common-sense which impels them
to go indoors when it rains, there would
be. in all probability, no spectators of the
grand pageant, and that would be a
calamity hard to bear.
Major McLaughiin looked out of the big
bay-window of the Central Committee
headquarters In the Palace Hotel, looked
up at the sky and groaned, alas! not in
prayer. He seemed to behold the crown
ing glory of the work of the State Com
mittee for the last five months, sodden
with the rain, and all tbe gilding and ver
inillion paint washed out of it. If he had
the power to shed vermilion tears at that
moment he would have done so, but being
merely human he followed the example
of the sons of Thor at tbe feast of King
Oiaf "and muttered, and muttered and
muttered their " not prayers.
None of all who gazed upon the scene of
opiendid patriotism enjoyed it more than
Speaker Reed and party, consisting of Miss
Kitty Reed, Congressman and Mrs. Aid
rich of Illinois and Dr. James Burry of
Chicago. The ladies of the party have
greatly enjoyed their visit in California,
and have made friends everywhere by their
gracious ways.
Colonel Higgins found it hard to be
comforted. In vain his eyes searched the
invisible mask of Jake fcteppacher in the
attempt to discern some consolation there,
but Jake's lace was as unreadable as the
scarred front of Mount Tamalpais. Colonel
Stone, wbo has the steady nerve of a
veteran soldier, and who does not hang
his emotions on a clothesline to dry,
looked just a trifle nervous, and Colonel
Summer was ill at ease, but glad smiles
cams when tbe gray veil of the threaten
ing heavens was ripped asunder by the
shafts of the sun and the clear blue of
California's sky appeared in patches here
and there, Then the clouds of dirty hue
melted away and left in their stead a
feathery mackerel skyscape.
Thirty-five thousand men marching in
the street and a hundred thousand men,
women and children standing on the aide-
walk cheering thcml Never has San 1
Francisco neen a sight like that before,
the nearest approach to it having been
the great Papal parade in 1872,
when 12,000 people were Iv line.
From the corner ol Howard and Fourth
streets, along Howard to Sixth, thence to
Folsoni, thence to Ninth, to .Market and
oa Kearay and Montgomery streets it was
with toe greatest difficulty that one could
force his way through the dense crowds
that blocked the walk*. The streets were
black witn the multitude.
The housetops were covered with men
and women nil along tbe line of march.
Every window from which a view of the
parade cou d be obtained was tenanted and
fluttered a patriotic salute with flags and
handkerchiefs. The Market and Seventh
street sides of Odd Fellows' Temile and
the Market-street side of the Spreckels
building, The Call building, J. J.
O'Brien's, the Baldwin and Palace hotels,
the Emporium, tue Flood building,
Crocker building, Academy cf Sciences
and other massive and beautiful
structures which have done so much
to make that thoroughfare beautiful,
seemed like things of life, with thou
sands of bright flags ami streamers waving
in the breeze. At thf time when the head
oT the procession had reached Montgom
ery stre t the scene as viewed from the
Ligh ground at the intersection of Market
ar.rt Ninth streets resembled a countless
fleet of American flags sailing down a
river of orange.
"South of Market street"â the teemine
abode of industrious working men and
women, the home of the best paid, best
fed, best clothed, best housed and best ed
ucated laborers and mechanics in the
worldâ exhibited the strength of its patri
otism by the strength of loyal numbers.
It naturally has a large population, owing
to that peculiar sociological law which de
crees tLat the misfortune of having the
least of the world's goods shall be compen
sated for by the heaven-sent gift of the
greatest number of children.
They were at the windows, on the roofs
and on the sidewalks to watch the hosts of
protection po by. Patriotic women held
big fat babies in their aching arms for
three long hours, standing on the side
walks, too much interested in this un
precedented spectacle of vast numbers to
retire from the scene to rest their wearied
limbs.
'Twas a day of joy for the owners of ex
press wagons. They took up their sta
tion at City Hall square, where the vaque
ros, monks and Indians in bronze stand as
an immortal monument to the patriotism
and liberality of James Lick. From this
point of vantage their lined spielers
&aTS
shouted "25 cents for a seat in the wagon
to view the parade." They had no diffi
culty in filling all the' seats the wagon
could hold before the bead of the proces
sion reached that point. A second row of
wagcus on the inside and farther away
from tÂ£e line of march sold its seats at 10
cents each in \cry short order. Favorable
locations io windows brought as high as
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1896.
$1 a head â not a Bryan dollar of 51 cents,
but a McKinley dollar worth 100 cents in
JJOld.
Everybody was dressed in his or her
best suit of clothes. Happy working girls
enjoying the half holiday tripped along
in >earch of ihe best points of view, with
new ribbons in their hair, big yellow chry
santhemums on their bosoms, and some
with the jaunty California sombrero, with
its braided leather band and tbe long 'lar
ger of tbe coiflure stabbing it to the heart.
Some of tbe gins chewed gum in a saucr
and sans souci way, and looked all the
more charming and San Fianciscan be
cause they did so.
The hatters could not have been so mad
as their proverbial prototype, for they had
done a big business on the day before. It
looked as though every second man in the
big turnout bad bought him a new liead
coveriiiK after the style of Derby, or its
more rakish brother, the Fedora, with the
crown recklessly battered in.
Then there were tens of thousands of
small flags, miles of bunting, leagues of
go'.den-hued ribbon, flags of tin which
rattled the story of protection and the lirst
tin factory in the United States nt NUes,
tin horns, the products of home industry,
unmelodiously blowing their own t:orns,
red, white and blue protection umbrellas,
tricolored toy balloons and a thousand
and one other things paid for with bonest
dollars to the stimulation of local trade.
Taking all these matters into considera
tion it is Â» sale estimate to say that the
affair of yesterday put at least $20,000 into
the pockets of merchants an<l shop
fcÂ«epers, not counting about double that
amount expended in the restaurants and
saloons.
Women who are making a holiday
downtown with their chi-dren looking at
a procession cannot be expected to stay at
home cooking mutton stew, which, by
the way, is cheep now that the business pf
wool-raising has been practically de
sttoyed in the United States. So thou
-1 sands of families dined downtown after
the parade was over. The big French
rotisseries, where one can get a good mea!
fora dollar; those not so recherche, but
where equally as good cooking can be
tasted for 50 cents, and the dozen or so
smaller French restaurants, where viands
cooked according to the exquisite method
of La Belle France may be had for 25
cents, were so crowded that late comers
were "coerced" into the three-for-fifteen,
turee-for-a-quarter and a dollar-a-biie
American eating places and into the beef
steak and oyster cocktail departments of
the big markets. Tha poor cooks and
waiters had no holiday yesterday.
FIRST DIVISION.
FAITH in the csuse of Republican
ism as ex* inplified by McKinley and
Uobart caused thousands to line
Howard street from Third to Sixth
to witness the formation of the first
division and actual start of the grandest
denioastration the Pacific Coast lias ever
seen. Business houses snd private dwell
ings were alike bedecked in gold, while
the stars and bars were flung :o the breezes
from every conceivable plac".
At the head of the procession rode
Grand Marshal Stone, accompanied by
George E. Morse, cnief of staff, and" T. G.
Hosteller, chief aid. Then came twenty
m unted patrolmen in charge of Captain
Spillane. They were attired for wet
weather, but looked none the less hand
some because of this extra covering. The
Army and Navy League in charge of
Major Kip and 1200 strong came next. A
very handsome appearance did these vet
erans present with their hand flags and
sashes of gold. Their faces were flushed
with victory, too, and right proudly did
they march.
The Oakland Alliance, 140 strong, proved
a pleasing variation. They wore uniforms
of olive coats, white trousers, white caps
and shining black boots, each man carry
ing a brightly burnished tech, sur
mounte i with chrysanthemums neatly
tied with red, white and blue ribbons.
The alliance proved to be well drilled,
and tb.9 members were the recipients of
cheers doubly sounded from the moment
the parade started until the final order to
disband came at Sixth street. The com
pany acted as a sort of body guard to the
State Central Committee, which turned
out in full force. The Union League
placed 200 men in the first division. Then
came the Soldiers' and Sailors' McKmley
Club, F. H nson commander; Union
Veterans' Union and the Unattached
Veterans.
There were two bauds in this division â
First Rigiment, N. G. C, and the Yankee
Doolie band. R. A. Freidrich acted as
marshal and was assisted by the follow
ing aids: Edward S. Saioraon, E. W.
Bushneil, F. L. Turpin, So! Cohen, E. R.
Rlerriman, Varney Gaskill ana James
Kipp.
SECOND DIVISION.
OF all the divisions in the parade
none commanded more reneral
attention than that led by Reu
ieu H. Lloyd. They formed on
Fourth street, between Howard
and Folsom, the right resting on Howard.
When finally the order to march was
given and the long line swung i.-:to How
ard street the assembled thousands
cheered it to the echo. First came thÂ«
marshal and his aids, Robert L. Toolitz
and R. 11. Davis, followed by a drnm
con sof tif ty men. T c attorneys of San
Francisco, to the number of 800, were
next iv line, followed by the students, 150
in number, of the Hastings Law College.
They bore a legend which read: "Lawyers
of San Francisco support the United
States Supreme Court."
"Ye commercial travelers" half a
thousand strong proved an interesting
feature of this division. They bore in
numerable banners, on which was in
scribed the doctrine of McKinley. There
were other banners also and from the
VFhole may be picked the following: "Our
Country Girls Are Witn LTL T V "American
Goods and Sound Money," "Cut Off Those
Whiskers and Joi-Â» Us."
The Chronicle employes were next in
line, followed by a float representing the
Re ! Rock industry. The float "Califor
nia Products," drawn by sixty-four
horses, was one of the handsomest in the
long line ot march. Loaded to the guards
with every known product of the oiate,
all bearing the inscription "California
Product! Need Protection," it is no
wonder that the people cheered them
se.ves hoarse at the story these few words
told. They realized that the remedy lay
in McKinley and Hobart.
The teamsters, with 200 men, were next
in line with a float which told their
troubles and gave a good reason for their
presence. On each side of the float was
written the following:
"Hard times and poor prospects have
â¢coerced' U3 to parade for better times,
more work, higher wages and McKinley,
sound money, protection and prosperity."
On another float was the terse inscrir>
rion: "Coercion is the cry of the demo
gogue, and free men are not scared by it."
THIRD DIVISION.
REGARDLESS of what has gone be
fore and what may come after it is
not going beyond the lines of fact
to Â»ay that the third division was
the peer of any in the parade. It
represented the printing art in all of its
featuresâ from the man who picks up bita
of lead and arranges them intelligently to
the lithographer, stationer ana paper
dealer. These various branches of the
same line of business placed about 2000
men in the parade.
First came the printers to the number
of 650 under the command of J. H. Dun
bar. They marched with steady mien
and alone the route gave faith to their
presence in loud huzzas for McKinley and
protection. On a float drawn by four
horses was a miniature printing press,
from which was issued a neat circular,
reading as lollows: "We stand for Mc-
Kinley; we stick to integrity; we press ;o
victory."
Near the middle of the division came
The Call brigade, 250 in number. At
their head rode a little vision of loveli
ness who for the nonce had been made
special aid of the editorial and mechani
cal departments. Her name is Mildred
E. Boyne. Immediately behind the little
lady was The Call division proper,
headed by Charles M. Shortridge, C. L.
Pat ton, J. Frank Pierce, G. A. White,
Thomas F. Boyle and Charles Conlisk.
The force waa marshaled by Patrick
Grace.
The stationers were nexc in line, Le
Count Brothers sending thirty-eight men
and Sanborn & Vail 150 of the 400 present.
The lithographers were also out in appre
ciable numbers, while the paper dealers
added 116 to the immense throng. George
F. Neal acted as marshal for the third
division.
FOURTH DIVISION.
W m cKINLEY admirers to the num-
A/l her of several hundred made up
111 , iie foUrttif oUr tti division, which was
I 1 under the command of Horace
*â  Davis, assisted by the following
aids: Henry J. Crocker, H. A. Williams,
Al Gerberding, R. M. Cloy, George A.

George W. Spencer, W. R. Srnedoerg, C.
M. Smith.
Ca3assa's band led the division, followed i
by the Sound Money League with 500 men
in the ranks. Then came several hand
some floats, telling stories of sound money
and protection, and decrying the fallacies
of Bryan and bis followers. The Stock and
Bond Exchange was next in orier, and
immediately on iheir heels marched the
members of the San Francisco Produce
exchange to the number ot 100. Archi
tects and draughtsmen. 100 strong, fell into
line as naturally and honestly as McKiri
ley and hobart plead for sound money
and pro'ection to home industries.
Over 500 insurance men, representing
lite, nre and accident, followed the First
United States Infantry Band. Every
man carried a flaj. and wore a McKinley
bad-e. As a whole they are the best
Etiown people in the City, and as a conse
quence they were loudly cheered all along
the line of march. The unattached mer
chants to the number of several hundred
cpnae after the insurance men and were
the last in the division.
FIFTH DIVISION.
COERCION was not written on the
faces of those br&ve men who
. formed the rank ana ti;e of the
fifth division. Ste&tlily they went
the long route, and at nearly every step of
the way sent up defiant shouts for Mc-
Kinley and soun 1 money. The division
formed on Mission street, between Fourth.
and Filth, with the right resting on
Fourth. William Ross was marshal, and
had as aids the following gentlemen: C.
B. F. Lincoln, A. J. Kaaten, George V.
Le Roy, W. A. Brown, A. F. Abbott,
George H. Robinson, Charles Robinson,^
W. T. Clark. George W. Lippman.
The railroad employes, according to )
some, made by far the best showing in
the entire parade. Over 1500 men marched
in line and over them waved a banner,
reading: "The railroad requires nothing
from us but our labor."
The local freight office turned out
ninety men, while San Mateo County sent
up a similar number.
Wells, Fargo & Co. employes, to the
number of 150, evidenced their intention
to vote for McKinley and sound money
and repudiate Bryanism. Over their
heads waved a banner which told its own
story: "We cannot help labor by reduc
ing the value of money in which labor ia
paid."
SIXTH DIVISION.
KNOWING that the crowd would be
very large on Third street Marshal
D. W. Hitchcock swung the sixth
division into Howard street quite
early, and with the assistance of his
aid 3, Wendell Easton, G. H. Umbsen, J*
B. McManus, H. A. Brown and W. T.
Clark, he soon had his line in order.
In the lead was the American band, fol
lowed by a large body of representatives
of Eastern railroads carrying flags and Re
publican badges. J. B. McManus was in
charge of about 400 of the employes of the
Pacific Mail, who were headed by a large
American flag and the steamship com
pany'a house flag. On a large banner
conspicuously displayed was the inscr p
tion," "If you want starvation vote lor

Â iO men in the ranks of the real estate and
landowner? section, at the head of which
inarched Messrs. Umbsen, Rich and
Easton.
The electrical workers presented a very
unique sight. The Edison company's em
ployes, 200 strong, were under tbe direc
tion of F. A. Nippert. The General Elec
trical Company was equally as strong; all
carried red, white and blue electric lamps
attached to the end of their flag sticks, in
the middle of the ranks was a banner on
which was the statement: "Electricity is
progress, but not without sound money "
The wholesale drujtsists also presented
a neat appearance, bedecked with badges
flags and flowers.
Blancbard's band kept the rear of the
division in step as they marched.
SEVENTH DIVISION.
IMMENSE crowds on Third street
cheered the seventh divigion as its sec
tions fell into line on Third street, be
tween Howard and Folsom. Marshal
A. A. Wa'kins proudly rode at the
kead of over 1650 men and he was assisted
by Aids J. A. Margo, John F. Miller and
F. J. Bims. This was one of the most
striking divisions in the parade, as it rep
resented the iron and boat building in-
dustries. Ths hardware, stove and metal
emDloyes came after the officers and a
drum corps. Each carried a flag and wore
badges. Around the hat of each man was
a broad yellow band. The body of men
acne filled the entire street and it was
necessary to send the floats down Howard
street lor lack of room. When the floats
swung into their places the shouts of the
crowd were deafening. Mounted upon a
large double truck was a large gasoline
launch, with an enthusiastic crew and an
engineer, who responded to the cheers by
a blast upon the whistle. The vehicle
and its marine burden were drawn by 100
horses, four abreast. The launch " was
built for Guatemala. Back of this was a
smaller gasoline launch constructed Dy
the San Francisco Boat-building Com
pany. The two boats and the teams oc
cupied two- thirds of a block. Each was
gayly decorated with flags, bunting, etc., \
and the 120 men who bestrode the horses
carried the flag of the country.
Never befoie haÂ« there Deen such a dis
play of the wine industries. Floats repre
senting all the features of the business,
several huge wine casks on drays, with
appropriate mottoes, followed one aiter
another. One over twenty feet high was
stool on end and tilled by the employes of
David Woener. Over this was placed a
large canopy of red, white and blue. The
Swiss-Italian colony's float was equally
striking, the decorations being made up
largely of grapevines and grapes. One o!
the most attractive was the the float oi the
California Wine Association, which con
tained on an elevated platform all of the
principal apparatus of a wine cellar. At
the rear was a representation of the great
seal of California â bear, miner and pod
de r . The latter was represented by Miss
Sadie Langdon, a very pretty brunette,
who was attired in rich yellow drapery.
After tbe wine brigade came the coopers
of the California Wine Association, whose
banner set forth that tuey want sound
money.
EIGHTH DIVISION.
nOT to be outdone in punctuality,
Ben I. Salomon, marshal of the
eighth division, and his aids â E.
O. Tuttle and P. J. Dietzâ were
early at their assigned station, on
Clementina street, facing on Third. The
Oakland Artillery band drew up in place,
followed by the jewelers, 250 strong, under
the charge ol J. T. Bonesteil. Five large
ONE OF THE SHIP-BUILDERS' FLOATS IN YESTERDAY'S PARADE.
Mlk banners floated in the line of men I
who wore tlie yellow chrysanthemums
and canes decorated with red, white and
blue streamers. After these came 100 of
the Oho Republicans under the charge of
L. P. MtCarty.
The crockery-dealers, 100 or more in
number, swung in behind, under the di
rection of A. B C. Dohimann, who was
assisted by Frank White and A. Schwarz
schild. Yellow was the prev.uiirfj color
in t: is bo iy. The striking features of
the San Francisco glass-workers' turnout
was two load* of young ladies dressed in
red, white and b*4ie.
The m<>n who followed on foot carried a
large assortment of their own productsâ
j bottles, demijohns and flasks hung on
iar -c canes and sticks.
The next in order was a detachment
from the united railway employes, bear
ing flaes. streamers and emblems of
patriotism.
The second section of this division was
obliged to form on Tehama street, facing
on Third. At the head was tlie Vienna
I Band. W. Mackay marched at the head
| of over 450 furniture-workers, all bedecked
j and enthusiastic. They pointed with
: pride to the float they had constructed.
I Tt was a large truck with a canopy over
i stacked rolls of carpet. Under the canopy
was placed a large chair of state, over
which were the words: "To be occupied
by McKinley on March 4." The redrock
and the rock industries were also repre
sented by men on foot and in wagons.
NINTH DIVISION.
LONG was th j line and many were
the men who made up the ninth
division. So great was the column,
which represented mainly the green,
dried and canned-fruit industries
and the produce and commission busi
ness, that Marshal A. D. Cutier and his
chief aid, T. , S. Taylor, were obliged to
appoint many subordinate officers and cut
the line up into sections over which the
officers had charge. Their arrangement
was in this order: Aidsâ J. McDonogh
Jr., Paul Barbieri, Walter E. Beck, George
Renner and J. A. Code. Captains â First,
Jerome Porter; second-, H. IT. Jaudin;
third, R. A. Holcombe; fourth, C. B.
Hollywood; fifth, M. Loewenstein; sixth,
C. C. Gilbert; seventh, N. Kittle; eighth,
James M. Hobbs; ninth, N. Wripht;
tenth, H. L. Burlerson. Guidesâ G. A.
Pope and F. L.. Himer. Buglerâ R. C.
Delemeter. Roncovieri's Band. Drum
Corps.
The numerical strength of the paraders
in the order of their calling was a-< fallows:
Dried fruit 264, canned fruit 198. green
fruit 314, bag men 118, commission men
146, produce men 137. fruit brokers 22,
fruit press 5. Total, 1204.
All of the men wore yellow bands on
th^ir hats and the National flags were of
tin, American tin at that, which rattled
merrily whenever shaken. Many wore
dried peaches pinned on their badges.
Not a few -mall horns were in the line and
with the flags and horns it was a noisy
division. Following the footmen were at
least a dozen trucks piled high with bags
and the accompaniments of the industry
and displaying such inscriptions as "This
is not a cut and dried affair, it is a
battle," "By their fruits shall ye judg<>
them: we vote for McKinley," "Bryan,
we are sorry for you; good-by."
TENTH DIVISION.
EVERY man who earns his living
in the leather and textile indus
tries must have been in the line of
the tenth division, which formed
on Minna street, facing on Third.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1896.
Marshal Frank W. Suniner was well pro
vided with assistants, bis aids being
Charles L. Field, James G. Spaulding,
John T. Fraser, Hermann Waldeck, John
Gilson, P. Fisher, 8. Nickelsberg, Albert
Frank, Ed Adams, D. Hamburger, E. C.
Ca me and J. N. Featherstone.
The harness-makers' and saddlers'
division, 200 strong, was under the super
vision of H. A. Weeener, and the men,
aside from the accepted decorations of the
day, wore small lea' her saddle-trees sus
pended from the lapels of their coats by
blue ribbons. Nearly sixty men of
Rosenthal, Feder & Co.'s shoehouse came
next, under the direction of J. L. Cal
lahan. Other shoe manufactories were
equaily well represented.
Along the line were numerous banners,
on which were inscribed such thouchtsas:
"In silver countries there is no demand
for shoemakers, the people go barefoot."
"In Mexico shoemakers earn 20 cents a
day." "Japanese shoemakers make from
10 to 15 cents a day," etc One man car-
ried on the top of a ten-foot pole a lar. c
stouily made thiuk-soled cowhide boot
on wnich the words "Solid for McKin
ley" were painted.
Trie employes of the Frank Tanning
Company, Kullmann, Salz <fc Co., Bes
senger & Co., and other similar institu
tions turned out nearly 1000 strong. ThÂ«y
were looked after by Albert Frank. Ed
ward Adams and Charles L. Field. "Gen
era! Grant was a tanner," was the motto
at the head of this line, and "No Budd
henchmen in this line," was carried well
down the column. Back of this section
marched the employes of Buckingham <fe
Heclit, who came out strong, at lea3t 125.
Marching in these ranks were F. B.
Robins, A. Dernham and L. P. Wiel.
The textile display in the tenth division
was a whole show of itself. Phil Fisher
was in command of fully 500 men, and he
was ably assisted by suoh men as Adam
<.rant, Joseph Grant, Levi Strauss, David
Marts, Al Steiner, L. Weil, B. Schweitzer.
Maurice Schwsitzer, 8. Simon, Henry
Saxe, L. Saxe, W. Conen, M. Gt eenebaum,
J. Mendfilson, R. Simpson, V. Ulman, E.
Blocn and otners. The men in the line
kept up a merry noise with wooden rat
tles. Several floats representative of the
textile industry were in the line.
The millinery employes dronped Into
this column fully 125 in number and
formed a unique display. At the head oi
the body was displayed a huge bonnet
that made as much of a spread as such
headgear usually does in theaters.
Fastened thereon was a bunch of white
ostrich plumes large as an office duster
In tbe middle of the ranks was a huge
gold-satin banner decorate 1 with violets
and surmounted by a large East Indian
pencock. Among the men were Robert L.
Toplitz, J. C. Beren lsen and Melville
To}>litz. Flags were carried on lon>:
fishing-polesâ not the kind that the pres"
ent President uses.
The wholesale grocers, provision, salt,
tea and spice dealers and their employes
and the druggists and chemists brought
up the end of thu very large division.
The grocers and provisioned were led by
Huco D. Ketl, F. Van Sicklen and several
others in the same line. Over 400 em
ployes were out, with a drum corps at the
head. Each carried a small broom on thp
same stick with the flag, and the signifi
cance was that there will be a clean sweep
for McKinley. in this line the broom in
dustry was represented by a large float on
a truck. It carried all the implements
used in the trade. Tbe whole was
mounted by a picture of the coming
President and Vice- President. Beneath
this was the motto, "Broom Industry and
Home Industry."
ELEVENTH DIVISION.
YOUTH and old age mingled to
gether in joyous harmony, each
and all reaay and willing to endure
the discomforts of a tramp over the
rough cobbles in honor of McKin
ley, Hobart and prosperity for themselves
and their neighbors.
Hiram Tubbs, vice-president of the
Tubbs Cordage Company, who has passed
his tnree-score and ten years, took his
place at the bead of bis department with
the same alacrity as did the youngest boy
in the employment of the same company .
The formation of the line on Third and
the adjacent streets between Market and
Mission was somewhat difficult, in conse
quence of the electric cars on that and
Kearny street being stopped on this block.
This, with a congregated cluster of trucks,
waeons and dump carts, which j:ot jammed
up in promiscuous contusion between the
clubs and the industrial elements that had
formed according to the programme ready
to parade in their respective order, made
things rather perplexing for some time,
until the tangle got straightened out,
which it did as soon as the wool-dealers'
heavy trucks began to move.
Marshal C. W. Hill, aided by Charles
Packsher and James Davidson, took their
places in front of the wool-dealers' section
and joined the end of the tenth division
with 500 men and three two-horse trucks
laden with what was before the Demo
cratic party opened tbe ports of the United
States to the free importation of wool, a
precious and remunerative crop from the
backs of thousands of sheep.
A band of musicians followed the trucks
and led the Marin County delegates, who
were followed by A. M. Peach, who mar
.-â¢haled the Cordage Company, better
known as the "Potrero Rope Works."
The employes of this branch oi industry
numbered 450. and they were followed by
two two-horse trucks laden with hemp
and rope, varying in size and endurance
from the ordinary clothes line to the
stoutest hawser manufactured.
TWELFTH DIVISION.
AN additional foreign nationality,
which heretofore contented them
selves with either not voting at.
ail or voting for the Democratic
party, took iis p*ace iv the ra:ik
of the Republican party. This augmenta
tion consisted of the Spanish-American
Club, marshaled by Captain A. de la Torre,
aided by L. C. Ratto, M. F. Clausen, S.
Bucigalupi and P. de Martini, with 250 of
its number in neat uniforms, consisting
of blue tunic, white duck pantaloons and
brown leggings, with a yellow sash over
the left shoulder, and each man carrying
a small American flag.
This uniform division was commanded
by Captain Alexander Rojo and R. R.
Duckworth, his tirst lieutenant.
The italo-American club from North
Beuch, in neat uniform of blue tunic
trimmed with brown, white pantaloons
ami leggins, 350 strong, looked and
marched well to the time of the McKin
ley club drum corps which preceded
them.
The Scandinavian club, the Swedish-
American club and the Lincoln club of
North Beach followed, each turning out a
full membership, which in the aggregate
represented over 1500 men.
THIRTEENTH DIVISION.
M i EXT, following in good order, came
I^l tbM tliirteenth division closing up
I I on the rear of the twelfth without
I I li ss of time or distance. Sylvester
Shaben, mouuted on a prancing
steed, aided by W. A. Laiupe, Joseph
Coleman. Fred Rothganeer, E. Taylor
and William Tuggy, lead the way for the
dashing, neal and handsomely uniformed
division of the Phoenix Club, which
marcued Jiko war veterans to the music of
Nolting's band. The members of the
Phoenix Club followed carrying American
flags, with banners giving expression to
"patriotism, protection and prosperity."
There were over 800 memLers belonging to
this club in line.
The Howard Club. 1500 strong, fol
lowed immediately behind the Phcenix.
and made a line appearance. This club
was marshaled by Fred Fry, and in the
first tour was "His Whiskers" Judge
Campbell, Dr. G. I. Drucker, Chris New
man ({resident M the Howards) and
Wifliam Blattner (its founder), who with
Phil Crimuiins started the club fifteen
years ago.
A delegation from the McKinley Colored
Men's Club had a place in rear of the
Howards.
The Western Sugar Company and bar
rel department of the same, 2500 strone,
followed, stringing out this division to an
unusual length.
There were an abundance of appropriate
lettered banners in this section, all point
ing to the benefits of protection to Ameri
can industries.
One re.id, "America, the Greatest Sugar
producing Country in the World."
Another read, "We Want Good Money
for Honest Labor and a Chance to Earn It."
FOURTEENTH DIVISION.
DETACHED clubs and citizens who
had not sought a regular place in
any division formed the fourteenth
division, which was led by the
Laurel Club from the Fortieth Dis
trict It also comprised private carriages
containing ladies and old patriotic citi
zens who had advanced to that ripe ag>
which made marching too laborious. Yet
the excitement and anxiety to participate
in a parade for McKinley and the party
which he represents was so s.rong that
they insisted on being driven around with
the younger and more active members of
their party.
FIFTEENTH OIVISION.
HAD the marchers been less good
natured and not so fully in toucn
with the spirit of the occasion the
divisions from the fifteenth on
might have been expected to find
fault with the long but unavoidable delay
to which they were subjected by reason of
the enormous number of men to be placed.
As it was they amused t:.en> selves with
campaign songs, club yells and good
humored chaff. The California and
Knickerbocker quartets were among those
who were detained longest and they fur
nished an impromptu concert of McKin
ley songs to the division in which they
were placed.
Michael Haley, marshal of the division,
held his line admirably, his efforts being
ably backed by his aidsâ Willis G. Dodd,
J. K. Firth, George Wimmer, George
Michaelson, Fred Bastian, James Hender
son, W. W. Fairchild, T. C. Cantrell.
Harvey Hnrris, Arthur Lewis, J. W.
Meredith, Henry L. Simon, George K.
Hart, fc\ A. Hoffman, Robert Christy,
Joseph Eckels, George Sartorius, James
Hamilton, R. J. Wilson, H. H. Morton,
Louis de Rome, Frank Birch, Calvin
Thompson, E. T. Morris, W. C. Johnston,
John Richards, George Cavanagh, Wil
liam Lambert, John Oleson, Vincent Gil
christ, R. Pengelly, Charles Eker, Patrick
Cronin, Forrest Bianding and John T.
Scott.
Following the band which headed the
division came the striking float of the
Bear Club. This represented a huge griz
zly bear standing in threatening attitude
over a cowering tiger. Four big brown
horses drew the float.
A baud followed and then came the
Bear Club, 250 strong. The driil corps
under Captain Judge numbered 75 men.
Their natty uniforms, consisting of black
jackets, trimmed with gold, white caps
and trousers and black leggins, made a
striking appearance. Every member of
the club carried a tin bear flag.
The German Republican Clnb, 400
strong, was led by Marshal R. Munch and
President R. Wieneke. The club made a
fine appearance with their flags and yel
low decorations.
The iron-workers' industry was fittingly
preceded by a float bearing a model of ihe
Oregon, the pride of every San Francisco
mechanic. From the smokestacks of the
miniature battle-ship smoke was emitted
in a realistic manner and the guns
beiched forth little biue clouds at inter
vals.
Twenty-five hundred iron-workers, re
cruited from every branch of the metal
workers' craft, followed. Over half of
these were from the Union Iron Works,
but almost every concern in the City
wuich handles iron in any manner was
represented. Held proudly aloft were the
banners of the ship-builders, the riveters,
ship-joiners, boiier-makers (the last
named with a float bearing a stationary
engine and a partially completed boiler,
upon which competent journeymen la
bored right merrily), machinists, black
smiths, drydock workers and molders.
The molders carried a banner inscribed
with the homely but practical motto,
"Molders for better times and sound
money."
Three hundred men turned out from
the Pacific Rolling Mills. A float repre
senting a maypole with festoons of inter
twined National colors accompanied this
body. Each man in line was decorated
profusely with yellow and many American
nags were carried.
SIXTEENTH DIVISION.
ONE of the finest appearing divi
sions in the parade was the six
teenth, marshaled by L. L. Brom
well and Aid G. fi. Edwards. The
Encinal band headed the division,
and Stockton Drill Corps, escorted by the
Young Men's Republican Drill Corps of
Oakland, followed.
The Stockton club brought an efficient
drum corps with them. The club was
uniformed in blue jackets with white
braid trimming, blue and white caps
and white trousers. They carried Ameri
can flags, and under the direction of Cap
tain P. M. Duffy and First Lieutenant
Giovenessi executed many difficult ma
neuvers with the precision of veterans.
The Young Men's Republican League
Drill Corns suffered none by comparison
with their fine-looking guests. The Oak
land boys, seventy-five in number, wore
Dlack jackets trimmed with white, yellow
caps and white trousers. They were offi
cered by Captain Wethern and Lieutenants
J. H. Kick and Clarence Crowell. The
Independent Fife and Drum Corps pre
ceded this company.
The Oakland Camp, Army and Navy
Leaeue, uuder Colonel J. P. McElroy and
in immediate command of W. H. Adju
tant, turned out 200 enthusiastic mem
bers. Each veteran wore a huge yeliow
badge.
The Oakland Sound-money Club, headed
by a band, made a showing of 1000 men.
A transparency bearing the legend "We
are from Oakland and in favor of sound
money" was lifted aloft from their ranks.
Then cam - 300 citizens of Alameda. They
were representatives of the California Oil
Company, the Pacific Borax Works and
Clars's Pottery. This banner bore the
motto, "No Coercion in Ours."
Tbe Fourth and Sixth wards Republi
can Club of Oakland, under Major Frank
Barnett, turned out a drill corps of fifty
neatly uniformed men. Their suits were
white with black braid.
The Fremont Club, 1000 strong, made an
imposing appearance. The club was com
manded by V. Morgan, and at its head
was borne a banner bearing the likeness
of James G. Blame.
The Polytechnic Cadets, with their own
drum and fife corps, bad titty men in line
under Captains H. Hauser and H. Morton.
They carried small banners bearing the
names "McKinley and Hobart."
The Colored McKinley and Hobart Club
had eighty men in line under John S.
Wilkins, president of the club.
The wood-workers, fifty strong, com
pleted the division; A large rack, highly
decorated and loaded with wooden buck
ets, preceded them. A banner was
stretched along the top of the rack, upon
which was inscribed, "Don't give us 53
cents for $1 worth of work."
SEVENTEENTH DIVISION.
BY the time word was given for the
seventeenth division to move the
Plumed Knights, who have proved
in many an active campaign ere
now that they were better workers
than waiters, had become weary of siand
ing statue-like on Howard street. Ac
cordingly as soon as they observed an
Miss Mildred Boyne, the Little Maiden Who Led "The Caffs*
Brigade in the Great Procession.
[From a photograph by BnshnelL]
opening ahead they marched irrepressibly
in before the dnveis of the six-horse
teams could get into motion. A.nu that
is why the Plumed Knights headed the
seventeenth division and the MoKinley
Invincibles had to be content with a place
behind the handsome drill corps whose
name suggests inspiring memories.
The Knights looked their prettiest yes
terday. They had seventy-five men in
line under command of Captain J. E.
Kline and Lieutenants James Christie and
E. E. Parmerlee. Their uniforms con
sisted of black velvet caps, yellow lined
and decorated with gold stars. They
wore yellow caps and black leggins. The
big float of the Union League Club fol
lowed. On one side was inscribed, "The
Union League Club is for Sound Money
and Protection." On the other were the
words, "A Double-ender, Bill McKinley
and McKinley Bill."
The Union League Club tnrned out 500
men. They were under the command of
D. E. Miles and carried American flags
and immense chrysanthemums.
The McKinley Invincibles had In line a
great transparency bearing the following
proud record: McKinley Invincibles,
Prosperity, Sound Money. Harrison,
1892; Harrison, 1888; Blame, 1884; Gar
field, 1876; Hayes, 1872; Grant, 1868." In
each of these campaigns the Invincibles
Badge Worn by "The Call
Brigade.
have made a hard fight for the Repub
lican nominees. With the Invincibles
were the California and Knickerbocker
quartets. They occupied a large coach
decorated with yellow and bearing the
legend on its sides: "We think it better to
open the mills to labor than to open the
mints to the silver of tbe world." Then
came the Invincibles in carriages.
This division was taken care of by R, R.
Russ, marshal, and aids, H. B. Masters,
General Freidenrich, D. E. Miles, Vaughn
Morgan and James McQuade.

Shooting and Fishing, a sportsman's
paper published in Boston, says editori
ally, in reference to the existing war that
is pending in Solano County between the
preserve clubs and the resident sportsmen
who are forbidden to shoot on the Suisun
marshlandst
With the coming of cold weather In the
north, and the great flocks of ducks which
swarm along the Pacific Coast, there comes
the renewed rumble of discontent, argument
and threatened trouble between various and,
sundry individuals and organizations in the
vicinity of San Francisco. Cat. Who is right
and who is Id the wrong it is sot our purpose
now to mention, but it all shows that some
thing is radically wrong with the system fol
lowed by gunner or sportsman, aa the case
may be.
Cal ifornia sportsmen should at all hasards
take steps to bring about an amicable settle
ment of the differences which have existed
and still exist in the coastwise counties of
their great State; they should endeavor to stop
wanton slaughter of water-fowl by snooters
throughout tiie cooler months ana far into
the spring, and stop the threats oi violence,
suits at law, and various difficulties which
have in the past not been creditable to the
lair name of themselves as sportsmen or the
State in which they take so much pride.
The protection of the very game whose loss
they deplore cannot be looked after while
there are petty quarrels to occupy their atten
tion, and the game needs all the care that can
be bestowed upon It.
The opinion as expressed by the writer
of the above article will doubtless be ap
proved by all fair-minded sportsmen.
There are game birds in abundance in this
State during tbe shooting season, and, as
the president of the State Sportsmen's
Protective Association remarked at a
mass-meeting which was held iast Thurs
day in the Alcazar building: "If the salt
marsh preserves and the professional mar
ket-hunters were done away with, and the
game thoroughly protected during the
closed seasons, there will remain wild
birds and animals in sufficient numbers to
satisfy the desires of all classes of sports
men."
The Mallard Club will be strongly rep
resented in the Suisun marshes to-day.
Anticipating some hot shot from the rifles
of armed gamekeepers the club had
shipped to its ark fourteen Winchesters
last Tuesday.
Before Sharkey was matched to fight
Bob Fitisimmona he penned a letter to
Joseph Donovan, the sporting editor sf
the Chicago News, which reads as follows:
I never felt better than since my arrival
home toe last time. I am here waiting to
hear from that big dog, Jim Corbett. 1 am
feeling; more every day that he is afraid to
meet me and Is not man enough to say so, but
wants to sneak round and fight Fitzslmmons
through the newspapers. I can't tell what I'll
do about it yet. Something may happen.
After Tom has finished with lanky Fitz
he will be then in a position to know ex
actly what he is capable of doing to Cor
bett in a ten-round contest.
NEW PATROL-WAGON.
Jt Reached Here From New York Yes-
terday Morning;.
One of the new patrol-wagons manu
factured in New York was delivered at
the Central police station yesterday. It
would have been placed immediately in
use. but it did not have brakeÃ. These
will be supplied as speedily as possible.
The new wagon is a vast improvement
upon the old. It is covered so that prison
ers are saved the humiliation of being
gazed at by the public and are protected
from the rain in winter. It also serves
the purpose of an ambulance. The seats
can be folded up when necessary and a
swinging stretcher substituted.

You see two very swell garmentsâ an Ulster and an Overcoat.
The Overcoat is made from those rich and luxuriantly
trimmed English Kerseys ; money can't produce a finer gar-
ment, art can't produce a cleverer garment. If you find like
garments in other stores they'll cost you $18.
These fine Kerseys come in blue, black and brown, in the
regular length.
You can also have the English Box Coat, or that venj swell
Top Coat, in tan covert cloth. You know they're $18 gar-

Brilliant Entertainment for

Given for the Benefit of the

There Were Ladies in Costume, Hal

While the City was in a tumult over
McKinley and sound money yesterday
many society ladies and their friends
were engaged with the absorbing pursuit
of charity for the little ones, those for
tunate tots whose home is the kindergar
ten classroom day after day.
The ladies realized, of course, though
too late, that they had made a mistake in
tbe selection of banner day for a chari
table fete, but when evening came it was
brought home to them in a most agreeable
manner that their good work was fully
appreciated. For despite the sterling dÂ«

mands upon all citizens to stand together
yesterday crowds of gentlemen found time
to v;bh the residence o! Mrs. W. 8. Dv
Val at 1012 Pine street, where the enter
tainment in aid of the Pioneer Kindergar
ten Society was held.
Great preparations had beenfmade for
the fete, which partook of the nature of a
reception, with a Japanese tea, a concert
and Halloween games, and also a really
interesting entertainment by T. Aoki, tbe
Japanese artist. Betides, there was con
siderable rivalry over two pictures pre
sented by William Keith and G. Cade
nasso.
The roomy residence was completely
transformed for the occasion. In the
halls, parlors, garden and verandas every
thing was distinctively Japanese, with but
few exceptions, whero some gorgeous em
broidery or ornament fitted in. The par
lors thrown open were decorated with
exquisite Japanese embroideries, which
were loaned by Mrs. David Bixler, Mr.
Marsh, Miss Jessie Robson of Oakside,
Napa County, Mrs. Louis Monteagle and
Mrs. George A. Moore.
Mrs. Duval's collection of embroider
ies, bric-a-brac, ebony furniture and cabi
nets from Japan were shown to good ad
vantage. Lanterns from Cairo and Con
stantinople hung from the ceiling, the
windows were darkened in the afternoon,
and so a fine effect was reached in this in
terior, in which long, slender palm
branches, ferns and chrysanthemums were
lavishly distributed over the walls. The
garden was decorated with oriental lan
terns and canopies and furnished with
bamboo and teak wood chairs and
couches. In the spacious dining-room
the decorations consisted of palms, mistle
toe, bunches of out Sowers and pumpkins,
hollowed and with rudely carved features
like the ghosts of Halloween. It was here
that the Halloween games with apples
and red Depp< rs, etc., were held at night,
and merriment was at its height.
As it was a characteristic Japanese fete
the young ladies and little girla and boys
wore the brilliant costumes of the lotus

THOUSAND MEN
Continued from Z7iird I>age.
marred the epectacle, and perhaps added
to the general effect of the spectacular, as
the division which would have followed it
was extremely diversified ana interesting.
NINETEENTH DIVISION.
RAH! rah! rah!
Rah! rah! ray!
McKinley, Hobart,
San Jose!
That was the cry of the McKin
ley Battalion of San Jose, and right heart
ily it was given. Major T. F. Morrison
brought up seventy-five neatly uniformed
and well-drilled men from San Jose, and
their ebullitions of enthusiasm kept things
stirring all along their route. Captain B.
L. Partridge was adjutant of this com
pany. The suits were white, with black
trimming. They carried flags. A drum
corps of seventeen pieces accompanied
them.
The National Republican League of San
Francisco, 300 strong and led by Senator
Eugene Bert, came next Tney carried
parti-colored McKinley and Hobart um
brellas.
Two hundred men, each of whom had
voted for Fremont, were led by Captain
Douglas. Their transparency bore the
words, "Veteran Republican Pioneers of
tbe Republican Party, Fremont and Lib
erty." They carried an old flag which
Fremont had once followed.
A similar organization, but whose mem
bers could boast only of having voted for
Lincoln, followed. They numbered 180.
The dainty knack of feminine designing
was seen in the attractive float of tbe
Woman's Annex of the National Repub
lican League of San Francisco. Tbe float
was a renroduction of the California seal.
Miss Virginia Blennerbasset charmingly
impersonated Eureka. When tbis float
was passing along Howard street, hood-
Jumb, actuated by a spirit of wantonness,
which they cloaked under pretend d an
tagonistic zeal, tore some of tbe flags from
the float and seriously impaired the beauty
of it. A large number of the lady mem
bers of the club appeared in carriages.
A number of carriages contained mem
bers of the Woman's State Central Re
publican Club. The ladies were arrayed
In red, white and blue Martha Washing
ton caps and wore patriotic regalias.
The Continental League, Frank G.
Worth, president, had 200 men in line.
They all carried flags.
The Afro-American League, 400 strong,
preceded by a drum corps, made a stun
ning appearance. The drill corps was
uniformed in black suits trimmed in
white. T. B. Moulton, president o! the
club, led the league. A number of Afri
can ladie? in carriages followed the club.
The skillful management of this division
was due to Marshal J. A. Wbiteside, as
â¢ sisted by B. Mahoney, P. Walsh, W. E.
fisher, B. L. McKinley, B. F. Fleming,
Eugene F. Bert, T. H. Rush, H. C. War
ren, M. D. Garrett, H. J. Bartlett, Sol
Jacobs ana T. B. Morton.
TWENTIETH DIVISION.
THE Thirty-fifth Assembly District,
headed by a brass band, inaugurated
the twentieth division with fitting
glory. The club had twenty-five
men in line, under Captain D.
Kelly and Lieutenants E. A. Grant and
E. H. Herrtck. The club uniform was
blue with gold trimmings.
Tbe lumber industries were magnifi
cently represented. One thousand men,
shouting themselves hoarse for McKinley
and seizing every opportunity to vent
their enthusiasm, followed tbe great yel
low banner proclaiming "The Pacific
Coast Lumber Industries for Sound
Money." The men carried flags, chry
santhemums and horns. A number of
lumber trucks and heavily loaded wagons
accompanied the men. The parade con
cluded with a large number of wagons
bearing tbe names of candidates for muni
cipal and local legislative offices.
BY THE WAY.
How the Enthusiastic Multitudes
Saw and Enjoyed the Demon
stration.
Prosperity came with a rush to the
restaurants on Market street by reason of
the parade, and furnished a foretaste oi
what those who will vote for McKtnley
and Hobart anticipate as the normal con
dition in San Francisco in the not far dis
tant future. It was surely a novel Bight
of late in this City, to see proprietors und
managers of restaurants standing at their
doors to bar the entrance of Â»ny more
hungry people, their places of business
having been filled completely. From 6
o'clock in the afternoon a shower of ready
coin jingled into the coffers of the lucky
business ruei., and cave them all excellent
reason to remember the great demonstra
tion.
There were many happenings and cir
cumstances relating to the demonstration
which have more than passing interest.
One fact was the persistent way in which
the signs of approval continued until the
very end. The street lamps were lighted
while yet the procession was moving. Still
there were standing on the tops of high
buildings, and perched precariously on
window ledges on upper stories of Market
street structures, scores and hundreds of
persons who waved flags and cheered re
peatedly at every striking feature in tbe
procession as it passed. When the dusk
had settled, and these enthusiastic indi
viduals were seen in silhouette from the
street level below, their voices still sounded
out their plaudits.
It was not difficult to know whether a
spectator was a Republican or a Fopocrat
by observing his or her face. Tbe Repub
licans had the corners of their mouths
turned up, while the Popocrats turned
their mouths downward like a rainbow
capsized.
The decorative taste of the friends of
McKinley did not confine itself to the
adornment of floats, tbe selection of
showy badges, or to tbe Drofase display of
thousands of American flags. Quaaru
r>eds became bearers and wearers of tlio
red, wbite and blue, with bands of gold
intermixed. At every corner some ani
mal pet was seen to have been appropri
ately becollarea with gold-colored ribbon.
Whole families of children wore McKin
ley badges.
At the corner ot Eighth and Market
streets stood a slightly built young
woman, who had with her a sturdy and
heavy youngster of perhap? 4 years of age.
When the bead of the procession came
down by her on Market street a crowd of
human beings had edged her slowly away
from her original point of vantage, and
she could not see.
She was able to wave her white hand
kerchief above the heads of tho?e in front
of her so that it could be seen by the
marchers, and many of them caught a
glimpse of it and turned their eyes in her
direction, but were unable to see her. She
looked disappointed, bat not so much so
as her young American boy, who raised
his voice in grief. The little mother
seized the lad and held him aloft until a
man who stood near took him. The young
patriot saw tiie most of tbe procession,
and the white handkerchief continued to
wave.
Just before the procession started there
rvas a rus>h to lunch counters. "Give me/
said a hungry man, "a Bryan sandwich."
The waiter looked puzzled. "Don't you
know," asked the hungry man, "a Bryan
sandwich is a tongue witn a roll on it?"
The highest spectators who gazed on
the procession climbed away up to the top
of the coppery dome on the new City Hall.
They were close up to the angel and from
the ground they did not loot to be much
longer than clothespegs as they moved
about. Conversely thewuany thousands
of persons embraced in the great proces
sion must have seemed individually like
pigmies from the dizzy height which sus
tained these spectators. They were com
pensated to some extern by getting an
unobstructed view of the entire length of
Market street, and so they saw the pro
cession in all its glory.
Crafty and enthusiastic women were
those who discovered about the time the
procession was about to start that they
had business upon the upper floors of high
buildings. Elevators were crowded and
elevator men looked on with astonish
ment at the sudden and enormous popu
larity which they had achieved. The cars
went up crowded and came down to con
front ever inflowing crowds. By this
scheme people who had no seats in offices
availed themselves of gratuitous accom
modations at hall windows.
When the wind began to blow down
through Market street as through a fun
nel, the men who carried big, square ban
ners had their hands more t.an ull. One
man let faii his banner three times, for it
was like a square sail for a fair-sized sail
boat. Two small boys held onto the two
cords, which acted liKe "sheets," and held
the wind full in the banner every time
that it was raised aloft. Finally the small
boys "let go," and the banner-bearer was
able to pull himself together and make a
new start.
There was one very tall protectionist in
the process on. In fact, he was so tail
that as he marched behind some horse
men his head was nearly as high as the
beads of the mounted men. He attracted
attention all along the line of march.
Tbe happy idea of a countermarch on
Market street cave tbe paradrrs an oppor
tunity to enjoy a view of the proce-sion
in detail, and the various divisions cheered
their comrades on the march heartily as
they pssÂ«ed. The countermarch also gave
the vast crowds of spectators an opportu
nity to see the show twice.
A Message to McKinley.
The Plumed Knights Drill Corps, after
the parade, decided on sending the follow
ing telegram to Major McKinley :
The Republican Plumed Knights, San Fran-
Cisco's crack drill corps, send you greetings
and assurances of success Tuesday.
Mask Lane, President.

Cat His Throat.
- Richard Mulrooney, 51 years of age, died
last evening In bis home, 1118 Sutter sireet,
from the result of ' a wound in his throat, in
flicted by himself with a re zor, last Tuesday
evening. The deceased was seriously injured
about ei?ht months ago, and at times his rea
son became slightly unDalanced. It is pre
sumed that he cut his throat while in an in
sane condition. He leaves a widow and a
daughter. :
Jennie Ward Die*.
Jennie Ward, the domestic at 215 Turk
street, who was taken to the Receiving Hospi
tal early Friday morning, suffering from gas
asphyxlHtion, died shortly after 5 o'c ock yes
terday mornins, never having ri.-gai tied con
sciousness. The body was removed to the
Morgue.
Found Dead in Bed.
David Hoffmann, 50 years of age, a maltster
by occupation, was found dead in bed in hia
room, 718 Valencia street, last evening. Juig
iug from the erudition of the bn.lv, death,
which was due to heart disease, must have oc
curred four or five days ago.
Steve Sanguinet.l Attached.
Stephen Sanguinetti, who is a Democratic
candidate for Supervisor, was attached on Fri
day for $71 50 by M. Brasasco, who claims to
have furnished Sanguenette's restaurant with
goods, wares and merchandise to that extent.
MAKING OF SWISS WATCHES.
The Manufacturer TÂ»kes the Beat
Offered Him to Fut Hia Name On.
It is most interesting to compare the
different methods by means of which the
highest grade of mechanical perfection is
attained in various countries. Notwith
standing the high character of American
watches, for example, the finest Swiss
watcnes still retain their great reputation,
says a writer in Cassier's Magazine.
Tne Swiss workman receives the parts
from the manufacturer in the rough, takes
them to his home, puts his best individ
ual skill into finishing and assembling,
and brings the completed watches to his
employer. Tbe latter inspects the work,
and out of a batch of, say, fifty watches, be
selects five or six as wortby of his attention,
and puts the others into his regular trade
under some general trade name. The se
lected watches be adjusts, working over
them for days, wee*s and months, before
he considers them worthy to bear his own
name, and it is these watches which go to
those wh'* not only have the money to
buy, but also the patience to wait.
A prominent firm of American jewelers,
chafing under the inconveniences of this
Old World method of doing things,
sought to introduce American metn
ods and see if the highest grade
of Swiss watches could not be made
more methodically. A factory was
built, enticing rates of wages were offered
to the most skilled of workmen and the
experiment was tried. But, alas I the
Swiss workmen soon found that no regular
wages could pay him for his loss of liberty.
To be on hand when the whistles blew in
the morning, to have bis stated hour for
dinner and his fixed hour for quit
ting at night â these restrictions he
could not stand long. Formerly he
had worked when he felt like
it and stopped wben it pleased him, and
when he was paid for one job he tdok his
time to begin the next, generally wailing
until his funds ran low. The factory plan
d.d not work for long, and the idle build
ing now bears silent testimony to the
Jove for independence, which is as much a
factor in present lite as it has been in past
history.
In these days of sunshine and rain we
are a.'l anxious to di>cover a true weather
indicator â one that is strictly up to date.
Not many know of the following method:
Go out and select the smallest cloud you
see; if it decreases and disappears, it
shows a state of tbe air that Is sure to be
followed by fair weattier; but if it increases
you may expect rain.
Five hundred million people now have
opportunities of studying the Bible in re

years ago.
Answers to Correspondents*
A Half or 1850â Miss J. M. C, City. A half
dollar of 1850 does uot command a premium.
Prince op Walesâ J., City. Albert Edward,
Prince of Wales, heir apparent to the throne
of England, was born in Buckingham Faiace,
November 9, 1841, is an Englishman, and not
a German because his fattier was one. When
he became of age he did not take any steps to
adopt citizenship of Germany.
Elections of the Pastâ T. T. M. , City. Prior
to the adoption of the present constitution
Supervisors were elected by wards in San
Francisco. That was prior to 1872. Henry
Bingham was a candidate for the office of
Supervisor from the Twelfth War i Â«t the elec
tion held in 1892, and he received 2702 votes.
Antotie Srhotner, who was Supervisor from
the First Ward, was not an Italian.
The Great Easternâ P. P. , Tracy, San Joa
quin County, Cal. The s earner Great Eastern
made s number of trips across the Atlantic
carrying passenger> an<? freight, but the ven
j ture was not a success. In December, 1860,
she was used as a troopship, and carried ab.mt
2000 soldiers from X gland Â»o Canada witn a
degree of comfort never before experie ced by
that uumber of human beings on a vessel.
Homes for Old Peopleâ F. W. L., Concord,
Contra Cos ta County, tai. There is the Old
Peopled Home, at the corner of Pine and
Pierce streets iv this City; the Lick Old
Lhd:es' Home, also in this City on University
street, between /ulton and Wayiand, on Uni
versity Mound tract ; tbe Old Ladies' Home Id
Fruiivale; and the Alte: heim German Old
People's Home, also in Fruitvale, Alameda
Couuty.
A Twenty-Dollar Pieceâ Subscriber, City.
What you would receive from the Uniied
States Mint for a twenty-dollar piece after you
melted down the same would depend upon its
weight at the time you converted It into bul
lion. A twenty-dollar piece when turned out
at the mint contains 464.4 grains of pure gold
900 fine, and 51.6 greiu> ot alloy, makine 516
in all. The value of gold 900 tine is .03870
per grain. A twenty-dollar piece that has
been in circulation tor a lengtn of time loses
some of its weight by abrasion.
That Amendmentâ L. B. F., City. The pro
posed amendment to the constitution of Cali
fornia reads: '"All elections by the people
shall be by oallot, or by such other method as
may be prescribed by law; provided that se
crecy in voting be pn served." The fr&mers of
that amendment had in view the possibility at
some time in the future of the introduction of
votins machines, and it was for that reason the
words "or by such other method as may be
prescribed by law" were inserted. Under the
provisions of that amendment the Australian
system now in vogue might be done away with,
but some other secret method would have to
be provideu.
Signet Ringâ E. B. S., City. A signet ring is
a seal ring, the seal of which is a signet or
private one. A signet is used instead of sign
ing the Dame or in addition to it for verifica
tion of papers. The signet in Scotland is the
seal by whichvoval warrants connected with
the administration of Justice were formerly
authenticated. In English administration the
signet is one of the si-r> tor the authentica
tion of royal grants which, before the aboli
tion of the signet office in 1848, was there
fcfnxed to documents before passing the privy
seÂ«l, but is now not required.
Shakespear in Hamlet makes the melancholy
Dane say:
J had my fnthpr's si? net !n tnr purse.
Which was tne mode! of that Daulsh seal.
Gold and Silverâ C. N. v W., Watsonvllle,
Cal. The world's annual product of gold and
silver varies, and from the report of the Di
rector of the United States Mint it appears
that there has been a gradnal increase of both
metali since 1873. In that year the product
of gold was 4,653.675 ounces. Increasing about
one million ounces each year. In 1894 the
product was 8.705,836 ounces. There has
been an increase In the production of silver
every year since 1873, except in 1874. 1875
and 1877. In 1873 the product was 63,267,
-187 ounces, having a commercial vmue of
$82,120,800 ami a coinage value of $81,800,
-000. Iv 1894 the product was 166,601,995
onnt-es, having a commercial value oi 81G5,Â«
757,300, and a coining valne of $215,404,600.
The product of gold in 1873 was value<t at
$96,1:00,000, and in 1894 it was $179,965,600.
Kino oÂ» Pet-rsiaâ C. F. f Stockton, Cal. Up
to within a recent period the Kings of Prussia
enjoyed the whole income of the state do
mains, amounting to about $5,000,000 a year.
By a decree of January 17, 1820, King Fred
erick Wilhelm 111 fixed the kroodotations at
the total sum of 2,573,098^ tnalers, which'
was sanctioned on January 31, 1850. by the
constitution, remaining as before on the reve
nue derived from domains and forests. At
present the total "krondotations rente, ' *s
far as i: figures in ih^ budeet, amounts to
15,719,296 marks, or $3,752,220. The reign
ing liou.-o is also in possession of a vust
amount of private property, comprising
casties, frrests end great landed estates in
various parts of the kingdom, known as
"Fideikommiss und schatulleuter," the reve
nue from which is not stated, and which
mainly serves to defray the expenditure of
the court and members of the royal family.
ETAMMEBiifOâ M. X., City. The means tor the
enre of stammering are many and various,
atd sometimes the cure bas been little better
than the disease. Drawling, tingiog, inter
polations or elisions of letters, speaking
either with the teetn closed or with the tongue
pressed to the roof of the mouth, sniffling,
whistling between words, beating time to'
utterances, stamping the foot, jerking the
body, pehbles in ihe mouth or tubes fixed be
tween the organs, bands compressing the
larynx and other absurd and uncouth devices
have been practiced. But the enre depends
upon the sKillful application of scientific
principles, whose only mystery is that which
arises from the little attention given to the
science of spetch. It is almost unnecessary
to say that the cure is not within the province
of surgery. 'The habit of stammering," says
an authority, "CBn be counteracted only by
cultivation ot the opposite hub t of correct
speaking, and this can be acquired by due re
card to the processes oi speei n, the relation of
breath to articulated sounds, the position of
the tongue and o: her oral organs in molding
the outward stream of air, and by patient ap
plication of these principles in slow and
waichiul exercise."
Thk Tbottble in Chileâ "Bodewin," Bal
lards. Santa Barbara County, CaL On the 16th
of October, 1891, some tailors belonging to
the United States war vessel Baltimore, then
at anchor in the harbor of Valparaiso, landed,
and while in a saloon got into an altercation
with some Chilean sailors, which resulted In
a knock-down of a Chilean. With that the
friends of the fallen man made an attack on
the Americans with knires, and in the row
that followed the Chilean police and a mob
took a hand, and instead of trying to preserve
the peace helped their fellow-countrymen,
with the result that a number of the Ameri
cans were severely wounded und two oi them.
Riffgin and Tun bull, were killed. An expla
nation ond demand for reparation was made
by the United Mates Government, but no batiy
facti.n was offered beyond the statement that
a secret inquiry was Instituted by Chile
into the affair. Tnis inquiry, concluded
January 8, 1892, was notably unsatisfac
tory to the people ot the Lnited S:ates
and public feeling whs further disturbed by
the issuance by Minister Matte of an insulting
circu.ar accusing the American Minister to
Cnile and the American naval officers with in
trigue and falsification for the purpose of cre
ating troubla between the two countries. On
January 21 the ultimatum of the United States
was served on the Chilean Government
by Secretary Bluine through the Chil
ean Minister in Washington, Pedro Monti.
The ultimatum was a demand of an
apology for the murderous assault on
the sailors of the Baltimore, for an indemnity
to the injured sailors and to families of the
mur<tered sailors, and for tn* ab>-olute â w.th
drawnlof the insulting circular of Minister
Matte. No reply was received within a reason
able time, so President Harrison sent all the
papers to Congress, also notice that Minister
Montt bad aske I for the recall of the Ameri
can Minister, Patrick Egan, "but before any
actiou wm taken a reply, in which all the de
mands were unconditionally granted, was re
ceived, the question of repa ation being left to
the Uniied Htates Supreme Court. The amount
paid was $75,009.
Ballot Reformâ J. E. W., Santa Monica, Cal.
John H.W.gmore, in his history of the Austral
ian ballot, says: "In the United States reform
based on the Australian system seems to have
first been advocated by a member of ihe Phila
delphia Civil Service Reform Association in
1882, in a pamphlet entitled 'English Elec
tions,' and by Henry George in the North
American Review for March. 1883. It is
also claimed by Robert Schilling, editor
of the Milwaukee Reformer, that he ad
vocated the reform in his journal as early
as 1881. The nrst direct efforts at legis
lation seem to have been mnde :n Michigan.
In January, 1885, a biil embodying the Aus
tralian ballot system was introduced by George
W. Waltheu <>: Lansing. It was lost by a vote
of 23 to 44; in favor, 8 Republicans, 20 Demo
crats; against, 24 Republicans, 20 Democrats."
I : 1887 Waltheu's bill was passed by a vote of
57 to 32; in favor, 47 Republicans. 10 Demo
crats. Tne bill, however, failed in the Senate,
but a law embracing the Australian system
was passed in 1889. The first pracical test of
the new system was in Massachus tts in 1889
under the law passed the previous year.
.-â¢ Thr tollowing is a list of the States and Ter
r! to- its that have adopted the reform bal.ot,
bast'd more or less on the Australian system:
I'3B3â Kentucky (applying only to Louis
vilie). Massachusetts.
11*89 â Connecticut, Indiana, Michigan, Min
nesota, Missouri, Montana, Rhode Island, Ten
nessee, Wisconsin.
189Uâ Maryland (applying to Baltimore),
New Jersey, New York (remodeled in 1895),
Oklahoma, Vermont, Washington, Wyoming.
1891 â Arkansas, California, Delaware, Idaho,
Illinois, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Da
kota, Oregon, West Virginia, Colorado.
1892â Iowa, Maryland (whole State), Mississ
ippi.
1893 â Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky, Nevada,
Texass Florida (for the city of Jacksonville).
1894â Virginia.
The only States in which some form of the
re ormed balloting did not exist on the Ist ot
1-fu January were Georgia, Louisiana and
North Carolina.
A COSTLY SUIT.
Cow's Dinner Took SI OO Out of the
1 Ã¼bllc Treatury.
Judge Hosmer and a jury disposed of an
amuÃing case recently which again exem
plifies the truthfulness of tbe proposition
that it does not pay to litigate for a prin
ciple, says the Detroit News-Tribane.
Gottlieb riackstein got just 75 cents' worth
of satisfaction out of Christian Kuan in
this suit. /
Last summer one of Mr. Kuhn's cows es
caped into a highway of Springwells and
while searching for green -r pastures per
ceived the garden of Mr. Hackstein. Her
mouth watered at the array of succulent
garden truck and, finding a possible en
trance to the inclosure, sbe performed tbe
work of a lawn mower on two rows of
beets before her presence was discovered
by the Hackstein lamily.
Mr. Hackstein promptly impounded the
cow and notified is neighbor Kuhn that
be would retain possession of the animal
until damage* aggregating $3 25 were paid.
Kuhn conceded that damage had been
done, but reckoned tbe damage to garden
truck at $1 50.
The parties hopelessly disagreed and
both sides hired lawyers. Kuhn replev
ined hia ccw and woa tbe case in the Jus
tice court, but Hackstein wanted higher
ajuaication and appealed to the Wayne
Circuit Court, After the facts had been
presented to the jury Judge Hosmer in
structed them that Hackstein was un
doubtedly entitled to a verdict, but left
them to say how muci mast be paid.
After deliberating on tbe case a short
time the jury returned a verdict for 75
cents for Hackstein. The trial of the petty
appeal case cost the county of Wayne
over $100.
HENRY WAS NO SAINT.
This Is What Mrs. 'Stowe Said of the
Famous Divine.
A writer In the Boston Transcript says:
"A lriend of Mrs. Stowe tells a quaint,
pathetic little anecdote of later date than
most of the reminiscences her going has
called fortb. A welcome gnest always at
the home near what was the home of her
later years, it was sometimes her wont to
wander, at twilight, from her own into
some neign boring garden, and through
the hospitable open door into hall ot liv
ing room.
In the hall of one snch house was a fine
bust of Henry Ward Beecher in white
marble resting in adeep niche in ibe wain
scot-d wail, and near it a softly shaded
light. One summer twilight, when this
light had been newly kinaled, Mrs. Stowe i
came absently in through the open door,
and stood lo kins up at the bust. % Ah,

A Well-Known Candidate for Supervisor I
* Few if any of the many nominees for
Supervisor are as widely known as P. M.
Delaney, the reÃQlar Democratic nominee
for the Third Ward, whose connection
with the well-known dry-goods firm of J.
J. O'Brien & Co., in the capacity of floor
manager, for the oast eighteen years has
made him a familiar figure to the entire
feminine portion of the community, while
his long identification with tne National
G ar.i, having served continuously for
fourteen years as regimental a ijuiant of
the Third Infantry Regiment, has brought
him prominently before the general public.
Although he has always figured con
spicuousiy in movements for the advance
ment of the City and State he has never
been an office seeker and the nomination
came to him entirely unsought; conse
quently it can safely be predicted that
with his business qualifications and bi9
unimpeachable integrity, no stronger
proof of which need be adduced thÂ»n his
long connection with J. J. O'Brien & Co.,
as well as with his complete freedom from
political entanglements, he will, if elected,
prove ever active in advancing measures
for the public good*

TOM REED
MAKES A HIT
Continued from I\rtt Page.
rled the election of 1892 as it was carried ex
cept the people of the United States, and it is
right and just that youshould pay the penalty.
Let me ask you one simple question: Have
you had education enough? [ShouU of -Yea
yes," and great laughter.]
Four years ago you followed advice, and here
you are. Do you intend to follow the advice
of the sAme men this year? [Yells of "No
no."] If you do then you will know where you
will be at the end of four years more.
What is the foundation of all human prog
ress? I am going to tell you that it is con
stantly increasing wealth. Whenever anybody
talks to you about a nation where wealth in
creases and men decay remember that he is
only a poet, and not a prophet, and not a his
torian nor a statesman. If you will look
through the history of the world you will find
that as fast as men have increased in wealth
and in the knowledge o r the proper distribu
tion of it the world has increased in intelli
gence and also in happiness.
You want first of all to get into your mind
what wealth is. Wealth is everything that
contributes to human happiness, whether it
be food, a due supply of clotning or an oppor
tunity to go to a concert. Whatever increases
wealth, properly distributed, increases also
happiness, and therelore, when we come to
consider the question ol the increase of wealth,
we are considering also the question of the
increase of happiness aud the progress of the
world.
You never have time for education until
your earliest and most trussing wants have
j been attended to. An empty stomach is no
basis lor a fuli bruin.
You remember how we started out in life
without even one layer of clothing. Adam
started thftt way and the human race went on I
in that feshion, but they soon found that for'
their comfort aud happiuess they must have '
clothing, but they thought very little about
clothing when they had but little to eat. Â£o
we have gone on from comfort to comfort un- I
til those that we have to-day, whether we are j
called poor or rich, embrace every enjoyment |
that the nobility and gentry of 500 years ago
had. There is not even a man iv this audi-
I enceâ not even if one of those stray Bryan
I shoutera has got here by accidentâ who would
consent to live as the noble gentleman of even
300 years sgo lived in the great country of
Great Britain.
How would you like to have your dining
room filled with rushes and your floors swept
out once a week? That they regarded as
luxury. We should regard it as destitution
and poverty not to be endured even in the
county that gave the biggest Democratic ma
jority in the United States.
The distribution of wealth has gone on in
creasing in its volume day by day and year by
year, and, thank heaven, it is a law of the
Almighty that the increased comforts in this
world are to be shared with the poor and what
we call the poor, or not enjoyed by anybody.
If you could look back 300 years, andl am
glad most of you cannot, you would see that
whenever anybody tiaveed they had to travel
oa horseback, like a cowboy, without the ad
vantage of living on a plain, and with bandits
and robbers to meet them on their journey,
and when they got coaches they were distinctly
inferior to tho-e that used io cross the plains.
Railroads were absolutely impossible until
there were enough people to pay railroad
fares, and it is so with the transportation fa
cilities of your City. They are all dependent
upon and have their origin in the increase
and distribution of wealth among the people
at large. No matter how rich a man was 200
years ago or 300 years ago, there was no rail
roads for him; there was not even a macad
amize 1 road. Whenever in the great city of
London the King wanted to make a progress,
on the very street named after him, they had
to have bundles of twigs and logs in the street
so that he would not be jolted out of existence.
Regarding great comforts, I am glad to
know they came to us by reason of the dis
tribution of wealth when we had the great
markets of America, which we foolishly threw
away four years ego.
Now, then, it behooves us to pay attention
to this question, and not to be led away by
rhetoric, not to be carried off our feet by
cross* of gold and crowns of thorns. What
we want to do is to apply our common busi
ness sense to this situation. We have had a
great discussion. It has lasted two months
now. I admit that the newspapers are great
educators. I admit that â perhaps it will do
for me to admit it even here in San Francisco,
but notwithstanding the fact that they have
the opportunity to iterate and reiterate what
they say every day in the week and copiously
upon the Lord's day, nevertheless when a
campaign opens the stump speaker has his
day. And it is usually a pretty convincing
day, because there ts something in the fact of
a man standing up before audiences and tell
ing them whnt he believes and enforcing his
belief by arguments, which are presented in
the face and eyes of a listening and attentive
people.
What has been the result of two months of
campaigning? The result has been tnat these
silver men are calling upon the rocks and the
mountains to fall upon them and cover the
question irom sight. [Loud and continued ap
plause.] And they have not got to wait long.
[Cheers.] Next Tuesday night will show them
where they are, and they will be so completely
buried that it will be impossible to show any
body else where they are. [Laugh ;er and ap
plause.] You recollect how gloriously they
started out; how sublimely and magnificently
confident they were; how they filled the at
mosphere; how they adorned the corners of
the streets; how they climbed all over us with
figures of rhetoric to show that death rode
upon the pale horse of the mint, and the de
monetization of silver Is and had been antici
pated in the Apocalyptic vision. (Laughter.]
Now they do not want to discuss that subject
They want something else to discuss. But they
cannot help themselves. They are going to
have it discussed until Tuesday ni^ht and then
the discuss on will be over. [ Applause.]
If they have any other subject to discuss,
and it is worth while discuesing it, It may be
of some use to talk. Just look at the dead
little corpses that there are there. There was
the crime of '73, the stealthy demonetization.
Look where it lies now. See the little mound
over it. Why, they found the man who en
gineered that crime was the loudest talking
silver man there was in the United States of
America, although he did not represent people
enough to send a member to Congress. [Ap
plause.] What has become of that doctrine
that we want more money? What has become
of the history of Mexico? Why, there was a
time when they thought that there was no
possibility of the Unit d States ever becoming
Â»o good a country as Mexico. That Mexico,
having free and unlimited coinage of silver,
was an example to the whole world, and the
greatect example except China. [Laughter
and applause.]
They said if we could only have the currency
of China, India and Japan we might be some
thing, but as long as we ciung to those foreign
systems there was no help for us. Where is
Mexico now and where the history of China?
How fond they were of all history except the
history of the United States! [Applause.]
Why, the last one of them who appeared in
the magazines ascribed the downfall of the
Roman Empire to the petering out of the
mines of the period. The mines petered out
and the empire petered out with them.
Every evil on earth was to be attributed to the
demonetization of silver. My friends, thank
heaven, the light of a full and complete dis
cussion has been thrown over this subject and
we are beginning to see where we are. Tne
splendid demonstration to-day goes far to con
vince us of what the result will be.
What was their argument on the subject of
the freo coinage of silver at 16tol? Why,
their argument was, first, the farming argu
ment, and second, the New York argument.
The New York argument was that silver would
go up upon its free coinage and become equal
in value to gold. This they stated in New
Yort, but New York knew better. Then they
came into the country and told the peo:>le that
the value of money would go down. to 50 cents
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1896.
on the dollar, and therefore the honest farmer i
could pay his debts ut half price and be happy
Now I said New York knew better, and I am
going to show you why New York knew better.
It did not know better ou account of its
knowledge of the fall of the Roman empire.
[Laughter.] But it knew better on account of
its knowledge of what had happened in the
United States and had happened within the
memory of every person now present old
enough to vote. These men said there will be
a demand for silver. The moment the United
States gives it free coinage there will be such
a demand that it will go up. Don't you believe
in the law of supply and demand ? Yes, I do;
but what is the law they are talking about? It
is that if there are a certain number of things
in the world, and there is a constantly in
creasing aemand. the price will go up. So it
will, but there is another law of supply and
demand and that is, given a steady Increase of
demand and there will always be a steady in- !
crease of supply at lowei prices. [Applause.]
That is the history of the world from railroad
iron down to furniture.
alt doesn't matter what yon take; If there is a
tremendous and continuous demand there
wi.-l be a supply and that supply will always
tend to lower prices. Now, that is theory and
theory is not safe to trust to because these men
have theories. Why, they had one in 1892.
H was that if we gave up our own market we
would get the markets of the world. And we
are struggling for them now. Now. I do not
give much for my own theories unless I" can
back them up by facts [applause], and in back
ing up this theory I do not intend to go to
China, I do not intend to go to Mexico, I do
not mean to adorn Japanese annals by any
translation of them; I do not intend even to
go back to the fall of the Roman empire. I
am going to talk of modern American history.
[Cries of "Good."]
In 1878 we had a pleasant situation ol af
fairs. We were trying to get back to specie'
payments. We had been foolish enough to J
issue greenbacks and trade them off for 50 j
cents on the dollar for our lands and had al
lowed them to.sink down and they were grad
ually getting back to power, and if you have
ever been below par you will know how hard
j it is to get back. [Laugnter.] The woria was
full of noisy people then as It is now. They
were abusing every respectable man in the j
community because thers was no way in '
which they could become respectable them- !
selves and they declared that something must
jbe done. Finnily we votedâ l did notâ to buy j
$2,000,000 silver a month, $2,000,000 worth, I
i $24,000,000 in a year. Now that is a tremen
dous sum. We talk very frequently about
millions. I huve a conception of a quarter of
I a million, I have a struggling idea of half a I
{ million.
I o.ly know it relatively, but I understand
it is a big sum. In 1890 we raised the amount '
which we were to purchase to 4,500,000 !
ounces. I was in some way responsible for '
that, but I thought that it saved the country
from a worse state of affairs from that which
these gent'emen are proposing now. What
was the effect of that tremendous purchase, ag
gregating in its results 600,000.000 of coined i
dolars and half-dollars? The demand was in- i
creased. Did the price go up? No. It was not
that law of supply and demand. It was the
other. The production increased and in- !
creased overwhelmingly, so that the result
was that it went from 7 per cent discount '
down to 50 per cent discount Now, is my
theory backed up by facts or is it not? [Cries
of "Yes."]
Now let me put a little question in the rule
of three which has troubled some gentlemen |
since I first put It. [A voice, "Why doÂ«s not '
gold go down?"] Gold does not go down be- i
cause there are certain classes of people in the I
world. If you borrow $100,000,000 of silver j
and the silver wen: down 43 per cent what '
would be the effect of buying all the rest of It? i
What would be the effect of coining all the i
rest of it? It would go down, certainly. [An- j
other interruption. "It would grow with the ;
j country."] It could not grow with the couu
; try, because we would not have any country
for it to grow with.
Some say that the production is limited. I
tell you, the mountains of Mexico are unlim- ;
ited. Aud another thing, while Mexico has i
improved the reason why it has improved is
because it has a stable government.
Bandits are suppressed and men can go j
down there and open up their silver mines
that have been closed for centuries almost.;
The manufacture of lead developed the pro
duction of silver. I want to say to you that in
my judgment the mine-owner himseli Is mak
ing a mistake in wanting the free coinage of !
silver. Ke would get the only bemfir, I admit,
because for a time he might be able to dispose
of his silver at a higher price, but he would j
make the mistake which a manufacturer
friend of mine told me he never made, and j
that was he kept his prices down because he ]
did not dare to substitute a boom for a busi
ness. [Applause.] And the silver-jiine owner j
had better take & lesson from that. But i
whether or not, I believe in doing justice to
all the industries of this country. I have I
always been ready to assist in that direction.
The United States has bought $456,000,000
Of silver or thereabouts and has lost $136,- i
000,000 in doing it. And I think that this j
shows a disposition to do the straight thing. I ;
have another reason. I lived in California for '
a little while in comparatively early days and '
I saw the miners and mine-owners that helped i
to people this country, and its improvement j
might have been put very far back if it had
not been for the sudden discovery of the
mines. Men came here and worked m the
mines ana when the mines gave out they
looked around them and found that they had
a richer country than there was anywhere
under the Lord's sun. [Loud applause.]
Therefore I look with interest upon the
pioneers, the miners, who are the pioneers of
civilization; but, after all, payment for pio
neering must be reasonable and consistent
with the general advantage of the commu
nity. We have got to so do things in this
woria that the best results will happen to the
greatest number. [Applause.J Weil, then, if
silver is going down, what is going to be the
effect of it? I am talking about free cotnage
by a single country and not about free coin
age undertaken by the whole world. A free
coinage undertaking by any country has been
a failure to-day, no matter where it has been
tried or under what sun. It has been a fail
ure, and what would be the result if the
whole world took it up I do not know.
The United States has made a failure of it.
They undertook to keep up silver coinage at
the ratio of 15 to 1. They failed. Then they
undertook It at 16 to 1, and at that time they
made the silver dollar worth 103 cents, and
the result was that the silver dollar disap
peared. Nobody was going to give anybody 103
cents when he would be paid back with 100.
Why, the very best men of the day would not
do It. [Laughter] But the United States
adopted 16 to 1 deliberately, and for that pur
pose. In 1834 a law was passed with the in
tention of demonetizing silver because they
wanted a gold standard. Under Andrew Jack
son, whom these people think is their father
[laughter], under Daniel Webster and under
Benjamin Bentbnm the bill was voted for after
a full discussion by three Presiden s of the
United St&tepâ Franklin Pierce, J. K. Polk and
John Quincy Adams â all of whom happened
to be in the House of Representatives.
These men talk abou: silver having been de
monetized in 1873. Why, that shows a pre
posterous ignorance of history. It was de
monetized in 1834 and has been demonetized
ever since. And yet they tell usâ you know
they can do nothing unless they appesi to â¢
prejudiceâ that this is a foreign policy Well,
I like to bear anybody in this country talking
about a foreign system which has been in
vogue sixty-two years. Why, it is longer
than any of you were imported into California
yourselves. Then they seem to think we
shouid get up a distinctive American system.
Personally I am willing to nccept common
sense even if It crosses the water to reach me.
[Applause]
They may say that we are so great that no
can lift silver by our own strength. Well,
now, do not let us mistake what greatness
means. The United States is great compared !
with any other Nation.
Seventy-five million of people are greater
than any less number. I will admit that.
The United States is great in relies, but com
pared with the Almighty the United States is
a small affair [Laughter and applause], and
the United States with 75,000,000 oi people
cannot add & cunit to any man's stature. It
cannot change the law of nature. Gravitation
works in the United States just as it does
under the effete despotisms of the Old World, |
and the nine Arabic figures operate here just
the fame as aero s the waters. And they
alwi >> will. Eloquence, beautltul metaphors,
pictures, etc.â nothing will change iv
Now, let me tell you that after 1892 you
ought to understand that the ever-ruling
Providence is not going to make miracles on
your account. If you do foolish things you
will have to suffer just as if yon lived under
the effete monarchies of the Old Worid. If
you made a foolish vote in 1892 you got four
years of suffering. And if you make a foolish
vote on Tuesday there are four more years
of suffering in store for you. If you plead that
you acted foolishly it won't help you. It is
your sense that will save you, and if you have
no: got It you won't be saved. Now, I want
you to keep some of these little things In mind
and do not be deceived with the idea thai
what is sanctioned by sensible men across the
waters Is necessarily foolish.
The very men who sneer at the monetary
system which existed in this country tor sixty
two years as a foreign system are the very :el
lows who re-established in this country, so
far as they were able, free trade which is a
British invention confined exclusively to the
island of Great Britain.
Now, then. I think we may safely take it for
granted that if we establish a silver basis we
shall go down. If we coin silver at 16 to Iwe
are going to have a 50-cent dollar sooner or
later. I know some of these traveling patriots
who are stopping at every railroad depot in
the country at present, say we believe that sil
ver will go up. "We believe." That will
do well enough for theology, because the lat
ter is to be tested in the next world. [Laugh
ter.] It won't do for business, because that
has to be tested in this world ; so until they
give us some reasons for their belief we shall
recollect what they believed about the mar
kets of the world and what happened. There
is no sanctity about a foolish person's belief.
A man may believe that he is going to escrpe
cold when he goes out Carelessly in a cool
breeze, but he will find he is mistaken. The
laws of nature are not suspended because peo
ple are absurd.
We have this thing clearly in our minds
that we propose to do is to shift from a gold
standard to a silver standard. Are ten half
dollars better than five whole ones? Do
thirty-two quarts contain any more than a
bushel? So if you have that lesser number of
dollars what effect will it have on trade ?
I will point it out to you. I saw in the pro
cession to-day the life insurance company
people. Did it ever occur to you what the
business operation of insuring lives is? In
the first place life insurance has Its origin In
one ot the noblest ideas cf humanity, the
idea of looking out beyono^the grave for those
whom we love, and it ought to be treated
tenderly.
What is the basis of life insurance? A man
pays in year after year his money; that
money is invested; there is iiothiug else to do
with It, and it is invested for the most part in
bonds and mortgages, and if a man owes a life
insurance company on a bond or mortgage
$1000 and pays only $500, that $500 is all
that eoes to the beneficiary of the donor.
Without taking in all the life insurance
companies but only those registered in the
State of New York, those have to-day, on
property $I,ll4.ooo,oooâ within $16,000,000
of being as large as the whole debt of the
United States. The men who collect those
mortgages and bonds in which that money is
invested can only collect in the currency of
the country, for they had the foresight of a
silver leader and did not put their bonds in
gold. [Loud applause.]
But they went on like the rest of us, believ
ing in the country and the honesty of their
countrymen. Now they can only pay what they
gave. If they get one-half they pay one half.
What does that affect? Ultimately 10,000,000
oi people.
This little, easy scheme of relieving the peo
ple from their debts by taking them away
from somebody else, cuts two ways. Why, if
you could judge from these Populist
haranguesâ that is, if I am not doing them an
injustice by calling them Populist, you
would think that the people of the United
States were the only people who borrowed
money and did not want to pay it back. Sow,
just observe that trick in their argument.
They talk about the people owing money.
Well, but whom is the money owed to? Why,
to the people. And a man who cheats a life
insurance company out of half of what he owes
it cheats the widow and the fatherless. [Ap
plause.]
But it strikes me there is another rlass of
insurance men wbo obtain some slight benefit
out of it. Nevertheless, I have such faith in
insurance agents as honest men that 1 will ex
plain to them without fear. If you have
$2000 on your house and dollars go down 5.0
cenis your house will then be worth $4000,
but the policy will stay at $2000 find the re
sult is tnat the upper part ot that house will
be sticking out through the policy and cot
j covered by it. [Laughter and applause.]
And the insurance agent will be able to sell
I you some more at half price. [Laughter.]
Now about the savings banksâ l cannot
I dwell upon those. You know all about them
.. as well as I do. I want simply to say that any
' man who ha? deposits of that kindâ and I
I hope everybody hasâ would be dreadfully fool
: ish if by law he reduced his property by one
i half. No, this idea of paying off debts by law
! Instead of by dollars is a very short-sighted
policy.
What this country wants is not a chance to
repudiate but a chance to borrow some more,
and l:ow are you going to do it? You cannot
do it under this system that is proposed. Ask
yourselves the plain question.
Let me ask of any man in this audience, if a
man came to you and said: "I want to bor
row $10, but I am going to try to get a law
passed to-morrow which will privilege me to
return you only $5,"' would you lend it to him?
If be has had sense enough to accumulate
$1000 that mnn is not going to lend it on the
proposition of getting $500 back. [Laughter.]
Need I say to the State of California and the
inhabitants of its greatest city, to an intelli
gent audience like this, that what this coun
try needs is more capital ? Not more money
money will always take care of itselfâ but
more capital. The United States is rich, but It
has not one-tenth of the capital necessary to
develop its magnificent resources. Even Cali
fornia has not 1 per cent of the capital neces
sary for development.
Here is a land, the richest that ever the sun
shone on. [Great cheering.] Why, the very
soil of it in some places is 20 feet thick, and
when I come to compare it with New England
I simply marvel at the riches that are scat
tered on all hands; but the riches that you
have are not for one moment to be compared
with the riches that you could take out of the
earth if you had more capital. [Applause.]
Why, I say, should this State of all the States
In the world so act as to scare the capital of
the globe away from it? If you want to borrow
money of anybody you have to suit them, and
they will be ready enough to lend it as sure as
they think they are safe.
Some people do not understand the differ
ence between interest and the rate per cent. I
suppose yon can borrow money in California
now, can't you ? that is, after the election
scare. [Laughter.] Thirty-two years ago
money was letting here for 3 per cent per
month In real estate security. The real diffi
culty then was this: The towns grew up one
day and disappeared the next, and the con
sequence was that real estate security was not
so valuable, and a man had to get 36 per cent
per year to be sure of his investment. But now
you are liable to be left with a town of
palaces instead of a town of shanties, so you
can get money at a much less rate.
The legitimate rate may be anywhere from
4 to 8 per cent, but the moment a man lends
his principal he must have a greater rate. At
the present time a man will charge a rate per
cent that will insure him against the peripa
tetic travelers of the country. That is what he
would do now should California Join that
crowd, [Applause.]
Does she want to stay her own development?
{Cries of "No !"] Well, she knows, and next
Tuesday will answer. [Applause.]
Now then, I think I have shown you that
there can be no possible advantage arising
from the efforts to change our standard, but
there is one thing I want to call your attention
to, and that is if we do change it we change it
for a more fluctuating one than we have now.
We leave the civilized nations of the world
and join the uncivilized ones. [Great ap
plause.]
More than that, trade is not going up in an
ovation. [Applause.] Trade is the patient
growth of the slow centuries, and the trade of
the silver countries to-day is absorbed by other
countries.
What we want is the American market for
American productions. I do not want to ob
trude the tariff upon you. I admit that there
is something due to the Democratic brothers
who arc so manfully standing up for the righ t
in this campaign. It is a comlort to every
thinking man who has hopes cf the future of
this landâ it is a conuort to them how manful
a stand these men are taking.
Those of us who are not leaving party do not
realize how d fficult it is, and they will never
eet half the credit that is actually due them.
Vet, I very sincerely believe that if we should
establish a tariff upon sound business prin
ciples, which should make Americans do the
work of America, the Democrat would
forgive us for doing it. [Great cheering.]
You see, my Jricnas, the condition of my
voice. I should be glad to talk to yon more
upon this subject, but I want to remind you
that it is worth while to go with ihe good party
that has a good history. I want to remind you
of the fact that for two and thirty years
the whole of this country was most magnifi
cently prosperous, and when I think of those
thirty-two years and compare them witn the
four last dismal years, I feel somehow as if I
lived in another land and belonged to another
people.
For thirty-two years the United States of
America paid off its debt at the rate of
$62,000,000 for each and every year that
passed. When I think of those glorious years
1 long to see them return, and I have abiding
faithâ which will be justified next Tuesdayâ
[uprourious apDlause] that this great, country,
under the leadership of MrKmley and
Hobart [wild cheering], under the leadership
of the grand old Republican party, will take
not only its owe place (its old place, too), but a
loftier place among the nations of the earth.
As the ex-Speaker of the House of Rep
resentative- took his seat there burst fonh
irom tbat immense crowd a spontaneous
burst of applause, that swelled in strength
and volume until it exhausted itself be
cause of its very lorce, only to be repeated
time and again.
Men threw up their hats and howled
like demons. Women waved their hand
kerchiefs and screamed; yes, actually
screamed in the intensity of their enthu
siasm. Flags were waving on all sides,
and their gay colors added to the optical
effect of animation as well.
When the erreat assemblage had some
what recovered there was a unanimous
demand for Hon. Samuel M. Sbortridee,
and he advanced to the speaker's stanl
and held up bis band. Instantly quiet
reigned.
Ladles and gentlemen, he began, a few weeks
ago the State of Vermont answered the call of
duty, and the grand old State of James G.
Blame and Tiiomas B. Reed filed her answer
to Bryauism and Tiilmanism. May we not say
to the distinguished son of Maine to-night
that California will answer his State on next
Tuesday? [Great applause and cries "That's
right!" "We will!"]
Let us go away from this Pavilion to-night
resolved each Republican ana resoived each
true Democrat to uphold the sound doctrines
which have been announced here to-night.
[Applause.] Let us uphold the Republican
bttnuer; let us uphold the Republican princi
ples; let us send a voice back to the East that
California stands under the Republican
banner for protection and McKinley. [Tu
multuous applause ]
I will not presume to detain yon here to
night, ladies and gentlemen. [Cries of "Go
on! go on !" here interrupted the speaker.] I
will not presume, but a great danger threat
ens the reputation of our country; a great
danger menaces the industries of our people
mechanic and merchant, rich aud poor, white
and black. [Applause.]
Thanks forever to Ulysses Grant and Lin
coln, nil men in this country are interested in
upholding the reputation of the Republic and
the industries of the people [applause], and I
appeal to Republicans In this State to stand
for their party; I appeal to Democrats to walk
under our flag; and to the wild-eyed, deluded
Populists, if there be any such here, let me
pay in all candor that no good can come to
them from the crazy-quilted banner of Bryan
ism in this year 1896. [The speaker here
paused for the applause to die away so that he
could be heard.]
Men may defame their country, but they
cannot defeat an intelligent people. [Ap
plause.] The workingmen of San Francisco
may be denounced by a corrupt and a cor
rupting press as slaves, but they are men and
will declare their manhood ou Tuesday next.
[Great applause and cries of -'That's what we
will. Hooray for Shortridge."]
See to it, men of 3an Francisco; see to it,
men of California, that in so far as lies within
your power no harm comes to this Republic
on the 3d of November.
Mr. Shortridge's eloquent remarks were
followed by uproarious applause, which
did not die away until the majestic form
of the man of Maine once more arose from
its seat and appeared before the railing.
"Fellow-citizens," he said slowly and
impressively, "1 want to say one word. In
principles go with it. Therefore, one
thinns very little of discussing candidates
and more of discussing principles.
"But I want to say to you tbat it is a
duty of San Francisco, not only to give a
Republican administration, but to give as
two members of Congress who stand on
the St. Louis platform. Mr. O'Brien I do
not know, but I say to you if he stands on
the St. Louis platform he will do more
good to us than the present occupant.
[Cbeers.]
"Let me say to yon with regard to Mr.
Loud that I do know him, and I know
him to be a straightforward, upright, cap
able man, and as I said to the people of
San Jose, whenever you honor him you
honor yourselves. [Tbree cbeers for Reed
nnd O'Brien.]

After the meeting the Hon. Thomas B.
Reed dropped into the Bohemian Clab,
and was pleasantly received at the United
Service jinks. He made a pleasant little
BDeecb and received an ovation, after
wbica be was hospitably entertained.
TEACHERS SAY
IT IS ALL RIGHT
The Charter Superior to
the Consolidation
Act
It Will Assure a Better Class
of Men as Public In
structors.
The following statement from a commit
tee of teachers of the public schools of San
Francisco has been made as an answer to
objections made to the educational pro
visions oi the proposed charter:
San Francisco, Oct. 29. 1896.
The undersigned, a committee appointed by
a meeting of teachers favorable to the new
charter, have carefully considered the "Ad
dress to the Teachers of the Public Schools of
San Francisco" prepared by H. N. Clement
E i q, and wo hereby strongly approve the
same as a complete answer to every objection
that has been made to the educational pro
visions of that instrument.
The case of Eunice D. Marion vs. the Board
of Education of the city of Oakland, reported
iv 97 Cat. 606, fully overthrows the conten
tion that the teachers of San Francisco cannot
be elected otherwise than lor life. The Board
of Education of Oakland "went into executive
session for the election of teachers for the en
suing year," and thereupon elected Miss
Marion, among others, to teach in the Oakland
public schools. Under this order of the board
she began teaching, and after the termination
oi tha year of her employment continued for

(ff|m!\ Address: J.C.Ayer Co., Lowell, Mast. - (f^h
two years more without any further order. At
the expiration of her third year the Board of
Education, without notice to her, elected
another teacher in her place. Relying upon
the decision of the case of Kennedy vs. the
Board of Education (82 Cal. 483), Miss Marlon
attempted to maintain her right to hold her
position for life or good behavior under sec
tion 1793 of the Political Code, but she failed
in her contention. Sne was defeated. \
In the course of its opinion the Supreme
Court used the following language: "The case
of Kennedy vs. the Board ot Education (82
CaL 483) is the leading authority in this State
bearing upon this question, and it is there de
cided that the election of a teacher for no
specified period of time, under section 1793, is
an election for life, subject todismissal lor any
of the causes mentioned in said section. . That
case goes s quite far enough, and the principle
here insisted upon carries ' the doctrine away
beyond anything there declared. In the Ken
nedy case the election of the teacher was for
no stated definite time, and it was not held in
that case that the board had no power to elect
fora certain definite period. Under its gen
eral powers the Board of Education is author
ized to enter into contract with teachers and
fix the compensation and term of employ
ment. If the board should employ a teacher
for one year It would be absurd to say that it
could not dispense with the services of such
teacher at the end of the year."
Again, in the same case, the court used the
following language; "While the statute, as
construed in the Kennedy case, gives the
teacher a life tenure, when elected without
specifying the term of service, we see do rea
son why a < Board of Education has not the
power to elect a teacher for a month or for a
year. Under the Kennedy case the Board of
Education of Oakland had the power to elect |
petitioner for life, but its power was not exer
cised to that extent, and her election, by ex
plicit terms, was confined io a period of one
year. We find nothing in the law denying the
right of the board to exercise such a power."
Thus the teachers will see that the Supreme
Court has expressly decided that the Board of
Education may employ teachers by the month
or by the year, as they see fit, and that they
have the general power to do so under section
1617 of the Political Code, the same as School
Trustees have under that section.
HUnder the new charter, with unlimited
tenure secured to all teachers now employed
or hereafter elected, and the same tenure ex
tended to all employes of the City government,
no Board of Education would ever be tempted
to take such action to test the general law.
With regard to he point that the Police and
Fire Department employes are expressly con
tinued in office by the new charter, while
teachers are apparently left unprotected, it is
sufficient to say" that teachers now in the de
partment are fully protected by section 1793
of the Political Code, under the provisions of
ich they were eleciel. ' '
The Board of Education appointed under the
charter will be . bound by the action of
their predecessors, as previous boards have
been bound from year to year by the action of
their predecessors. â¢
, With regard to the renewal of certificates we
wish to add to the points made in Mr. Cle
ment's address that the Superintendent and
his deputies will constltu:e the City Board of
Examiners, and I therefore will succeed to all
the powers exercised by the City Board of Ex
aminers in the general law and therefore will
have the power to renew all certificates when
such action is required.
We consider the charter superior to the con
solidation act for the ioliowijiÃ reasons:
Firstâ When the constitution . shall be so
amended as to permit the appointment of the
Board oi Education in lieu of its election we
shall have- a better class of men to manage the
purely educational affairs of the schools.
Secondâ We shall have a liberal salary fund
guarded by the Auditor and devoted to sal
aries alone.
. Thirdâ Our tenure of office will be strength
ened in itself and buttressed by the civil ser
vice rules which prevail in other departments
of the City government
We congratulate ourselves and our fellow
teachers that the charter makes these vital
improvements, in. educational concerns and
that we are not hindered by fear of any dan
ger to our personal interests from allying our
selves with those intelligent and public-spir
ited fellow-citizens who are endeavoring by
their voices and votes to secure good and pure
government for our beloved City.

Major McKinley Will Get an Over*

and the Who c Nation.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 31.â M. A. Hanna
rolled down his mahogany desk to-night
and at the same time practically closed
the Presidential campaign of 1896 so far
as the Republican party is concerned.
Senator Jones likewise closed the Demo
cratic National campaign headquarters
and the army of party workers through
out the Nation will rest on their arms
until election morning, when they will
marshal the voters for the battle at the
polls.
The campaign leaders on both sides gave I
public utterances to their serene con
fidence that victory would crown their
fieht for the suffrages of th 9 citizens and
that spirit was reflected in the general
enthusiasm at the various party head
quarters.
'Flag day," originated by the Repub
lican managers and adopted by the Dem
ocrats, was like a triple extract of the "glo
rious Fourth," and estimatine its success
by the number of McKinley and Hobart
portrait accompaniments of the National
colors, tbe originators of tbe patriotic dis
play congratulated themselves that they
had shown the Republican ticket bad a
majority of supporters in this citr.
Chairman McMillan of the lowa Re
publican Committee wired to headquar- |
ters: '"Fiag order has been generally ob
served. Whole State wild with enthusi
asm for McKinley. 1 '
The following parting message was tele
graphed to Major McKinley by the Na
tional Committee and heads of depart
ments at tne close of the day's work:
"Advices from all parts of the country
assure us that 'flag day' was generally
observed by the patriotic people through
out tne Nation."
Telegrams innumerable have been re
ceived by the National Committee con
gratulating the Republicans on the great
success of the day and the prospects of a
glorious victory next Tuesday.
OHIO.
COLUMBUB, Ohio, Oct. 31.â The officers
to be elected in Ohio next Tuesday are
Secretary of State. Judge of the Supreme
Court, Food and Dairy Commissioner,
-Memben of the Board of Public Works,
twenty-one Congressmen and twenty-three
Presidential Electors.
Garh'eld's plurality of 34,000 is tbe great
est that Ohio has eiven for a Presidential
candidate since 1873. The plurality for
Harrison in 1892 was 1072. Brough's" ma
jority in IS6B was 101,000; the next largest
majority ever given was 64.000. The ma
jority for Governor last year was less than
17,000. Notwithstanding the fact that the
Populist pany that polled 52,000 votes last
year and the National Prohibition party
Have fused with the Democrats, I see no
reason to change the ODinion expressed by
me one week ago â that Ohio would give
McKinley a greater majority than she
ever gave to a leading candidate on the
Stats or National ticket with the possible
exception of that given to Brough for
Governor in 1868.
Never in the history of the State has
there been a political contest of the char
acter and magnitude of the one just draw
ing to a close. We have an absolutely
perfect organizati on. The record of for
mer campaigns does not show any parallel
in the number of public meetings that
have been held this year. One feature
alone of our work has been the distribu
tion of over 15,000,0 00 documents, which,
if equally apportioned to Republicans,
would make an average of about thirty to
every such voter in tbe State. The great
eat total vote ever cast in the State waa
861,000 for President in 1892. The indica
tions point to a total vote this year of
925,000. We will most certainly elect nine
teen of the tw enty-one Congressmen.
C. L. Kubtz,
Chairman Republican State Executive
Committee.
UTAH.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Oct. 3Lâ The cam
paign in Utah, which practically closes to
night, was perhaps the most uninteresting
waged in any State. The free silver advo
cates are in such an overwhelming major
ity that the opposition almost lfct it go by
default. It is conceded that the Demo
cratic, Silver Republican and Populist fu
sion on the Bryan electors will carry the
Siate by an overwhelming majority; that
the McKinley electors may get 20 per cent
of the votes to be cast and that the Palmer
and Buckner electors will do well if they
get 1 per cent of the total vote. There is
no fusion on the Congressional ticket.
Judge W. H. King is the Democratic
nominee, Lafayette Holbrook the Repub
can and Warren Foster the Populist
Holbrook is not considered sufficiently
strong for silver to satisfy the silver ele
ment, while King is ultra silver and will
pull heavily from the Republicans,
and his opponents concede he will beyond
doubt be elected.
The Populist candidate cuts no figure
either way. The only real contest Is on the
Legislature, which will elect a United
States Senator. Both Republicans and
Democrats claim it, with probably about
even chances, but whichever party wins
will send a free silver man to tbe Senate.
The principal speakers in the campaign
on the Republican side were Senator
Brown, Judge Bennett, John M. Zane ana
ex-Governor Thomas, and on the Demo
cratic and fusion Judges Powers, King
and Thurman, and Z. Varian, ex-Con
gressman J. L. Rawlinu, David Evans,
Frank B. Stephens and Fisher S. Harris,
Senator Cannon and Congressman Allen.
IDAHO.
BOIBE, Idaho, Oct. 31.â The most in
terest in the campaign in Idaho centers on
the Senatorial tight between Dubols, the
present Republican free-silver Senator,
and some Populist, probably Claggett.
> To-night the Dubois managers claim a
small majority of the Legislature, while
tne Democratic-Populist fusionists accord
Dubois only twenty-five votes, thirty-six
being necessary to elect, and the chances
are thai Dubois will be defeated and the
Senatorial toga go to some Poi>ulist in
pursuance of the agreement between the
Democrats and Populists.
Everybody concedes that the Bryan
electors will carry the State, and it is
only a question of how largp the majority
will be, although the McKinley people,
headed by Senator Shoup, claim if the
campaign had lasted thirty d;iys longer
they would carry the Stale for the Major.
The Congressional contest between Mor
rison (McKinleyitc). Bohr (Silver Re
publican) and Gunn (Democratic-Pop
ulist) fusion candidate, is sufficiently
warm to be interestin , and the man
agers of each claim the victory. Bohr's
and Gunn's supporters are, however,
more confident than Morrison's.
The friends of David H. Budlonr, gold
Republican candidate for Governor, con
cede his defeat, he having a bard combi
nation to run against in Steiuneberg, the
nominee of the Democrats, Silver Repub
licans and Popuiists. The chances of
Congressman Wilson (Silver Republican)
and R. P. Charles (Democratic-Populist)
for election as Justice t of the Supreme
Court are considered about even.
Cons derable stir has been made about
alleged Mormon Church influence being
used against Senator Duboi?. The 'church
denies it, and there was probably not as
much in it as was supposed.
NEBRASKA.
LINCOLN, Nebk., Oct. 31.â The most
exciting and stubbornly contested polit
ical campaign in the history of Nebraska
virtually closed to-night with big meet
ings at nearly all the larger towns of the
Btate. Every county has been thoroughly
covered, not only by local talent but by
speakers of National fame, ln this re
spect the Republicans have led, securing
the services of ex-Senator Farwell of Chi
cago, Senator-elect Foraker of Ohio, Con
gressman Gunster of Wisconsin, R. G.
Horr of Michigan and Bourke Cockran.
For the Silver Democrats and Populists,
between whom fusion hns been estab
lished, not only on the National candi
dates, but for the State and Tougressional
tickets, but few speakers have been im
ported. Generals Palmer and Buclcner
only have appeared for the National Dem
ocrats.
Conservative men generally admit thnt
the contest will be close. Chairman Posts
claims the State for McKinley by 18,000
and insists that John H. Mac Call, for
Governor, will fare as wel!. Chairman
Edmiston for the Populists and Chairman
Dahlman for the Democrats, whose inter
ests are identical, place the plurality for
Bryan and silver. Asa Holcomb for Gov
ernor, as a result of fusion, at 25,000. R.
S. Bibb is the National Democratic nomi
nee and his managers make no claims.
The present outlook is that the Repub
licans will carry the First, Second, Fourth
and Fifth Congressional Districts and the
fusionists the Third and Sixth.
COLORADO.
DENVER, Colo., Oct. 81.â Indications
are that Bryan will carry Colorado by a
majority of 100,000. S nator Wolcott, who
leads the McX nley forces, hopes to secure
50,000 votes, but the Bryan managers will
not concede McKinley more than 25,000,
which would give Bryan over 100,000 ma
jority. There are three Btate tickets â a
fusion of Democrats and Silver Republi
cans led by ex-Governor Adams, a fusion
of Populisms and National Silver party led
by Judge Bailey, both for Bryan electors,
and a straight Republican McKinley
ticket, headed by Judge Allen. The
Adams people to-night claim the ex-Gov
ernor's election by 10,000 Mr. Bailey's
managers aÃsert that Judee Bailey will
carry the State by fully 20,000. and that
Allen will be second in the race. Ex-Gov
ernor Waite is also a candidate for Gover
nor, but is not regarded as a factor.
IOWA.
DEfe MOINES, lowa, Oct. 31.â The cam
paign in lowa, which practically closes to
night, has been the most active and ab
sorDing the State ever knew. Both sides
have conducted vigorous and well organ
ized campaigns. Cockran, Allison, Thurs
ton, Horr, Palmer and Buckner; Sickels,
Alger, General Howard, Senators Stewart
and Teller; \V. E. Mason of Chicago, For
aker and other National characters, as
well as a multitude of lesser lights, have
taken active parts. Mr. Bryan has thrice
crossed the State, the last time to-day,
when he had immensem mense meetings along the
line of the Chicago, Burlington and
Quincv. The Democrats and Populists
have fused. Republican managers claim
1 the State by 75,000 and the Democrats say
they wrfi carry it by 15,000 to 25,000. Com
mon opinions arc that the republicans
j will safely carry the Str.te. The Republi
| cans claim every one of the eleven Con
| gressmen; the Democrats claim they have
good chances to carry five. Indications
are the Republicans are practically sure of
nine and that the Democrats have iight
incr chances for two. The State tickets
I wll run with the National tickets and the
I Republicans confidently claim tLe eloc-
J tlon of their ticket.
WISCONSIN.
MILWAUKEE, Wib., Oct. 31. - The
campaign in Wisconsin is over, the Re
publican and Democratic chairmen have
issued their final orders and estimates ami
now the voters will do the rest. The Re
publicans have put up a splendid cam
paign in Wisconsin. Chairman Coe of the
Btate Committee issued a statement to
day claiming the State by 71,000 plurality
for McKinley and Hobart and the election
or the whole Congressional delegation.
Bets are two to one that McKinley â¢â¢arrics
the State by over 25,000 plurality. Perfect
fusion between Democrats and Populisms
obtains on the electoral, State, Congres
sional, legislative and many county
tickets.
MICHIGAN.
DETROIT, Mich., Oct 31.â The Repub
lican and Democratic Central Committees
in this StatÂ° mAc contradictory claims.
The RepnbiicanXJommittee claims that
McKiniey will carry the State by 20,000, of
which 10,000 is expected from the upper
peninsula. Ten Congressmen &re also
claimed, two being conceded to the Demo
crats. The committee declines to state
which districts it expects to lose. The
Democratic Committee says that its in
formation Btiows a Bryan majority of
32,00J in the State. On Congressmen it
expects to carry the First, Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth
.and Tentii districts, with a fighting chance
l n the Ninth and Eleventh.
On the State ticket, Pingree (R.) for
Governor is expected to run behind Mc-
Kinley by both parties, and Sligh (fusion)
to run ahead of Bryan. Sligh will receive
many Republican and go:d Democratic
votes which will not go to Pingree. .The
railroad and business interests which
Pingree has been antagonizing while
Mayor of Detroit are expected to cut his
vote.
KENTUCKY.
LODIS VILLE. Ky., Oct. 31.â The bitter
est political campaign ever waged in Ken
tucky closed to-night with excitement at
wholesale. More speeches have been made
in Kentucky this fall than in any two
previous campaigns. Violence has been a
frequent ocenrrence at political meetings
and several deaths have resulted irom
quarrels which arose at these gatherings.
The principal free silver Democratic ora
tors were Senator Blackburn, ex-Governor
John Youns Brown, Governor Stone of
Missouri, General P. W. Hardin and
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1896.
iiryan, who made about fifteen speeches
in the State. The Republicans had in the
field Governor Brad cv, United States
Senator Frye, John W. Yerkes, Alger's
Union generals and ex-Chief Justice E.
\Y. H. Hoit. The National Democrats
were represented by Secretary Carlisle,
Bourke Cockran, John R. Fellows, United
States Senators Lindsay, Caffery, Piilraer
and Buckuer, and ex-Congressman W. D.
Bynum.
Chuirman Roberts of the Republican
campaign committee claims the State for
McKinley by from 15,000 to 25,000. He
alsS claims nine Congressmen, including
Colonel Breckinridge, and a fighting
chance for two more."
Chairman Sommers of the free silver
Democratic campaign committee says
that Bryan wlil come to Louisville with
29,000 plurality. He concedes Louisville
to McKinley by 3000. Mr. Sommers claims
eleven Congressmen. The free silver
Democrats and Populists have fused on
the electoral ticket and on Congressional
candidates in oil but two districts. The
Populists have two representatives on the
electoral ticket and these will bring 10.000
Populist votes to Bryan.
Chairman Goorne A. Davis of the Na
tional Democratic State Central Commit
tee estimates that there are 50.000 Demo
crats who will not vote for Bryan. He
does not state how many of these will vote
for Palmer and Buckner, but the indica
tions are that McKinley will get the big
gest part of this vote, especially in Louis
ville.
There are eiÂ»ht vacancies in the Legis
lature to be filled, and upon the result de
pends the control of that body. If the
Republicans secure seven, which is not
unlikely, they will elect Governor Brad
â¢ley to succeed Senator Blackburn at the
coming extra session. If the Democrats
secure a majority Secretary Carlisle will
be elected Senator by a combination of
Republican and gold Democratic mem
bers.
CONNECTICUT.
NEW HAVEN, Cosn., Oct. 3LâChair
man Troup of the Democratic State Com
mittee said to-day that, based on the fig
ures submitted by the members of the
State Committee at yesterday's meeting.
McKinley has an apparent majority of
8000 in the State. Personally he believes
that Bryan will carry the State by a com
fortable working majority.
ILLINOIS.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct 31.â The political
situation and election probabilities from
the Democratic-Populist fusion point of
view was summarized as follows by Secre
tary of State Hinrichseu:
The condition of the Democratic party has
improved greatly during the last ten day.
The effect of Bryan's tour through the Stat*
and his speeches in Chicago is plainly percept
ible in the increasing Democratic confidence
and enthusiasm. We have more votes in Chi
cago than the Republicans have, and I look
ior a majority in this city. The State out>ido
is overwhelmingly Democratic, and, making
every allowance for doubtful voters and sur
plus enthusiasm, 1 feel that we f hall carry this
State for the whole ticket by 25,000 or 30,000
plurality.
We will elect fourteen of the twenty-two
Congressmen without question, aad may elect
sixteen. We will elect a majority of the As
sembly, while the Republicans will control
the Senate, owing to the large number of hold
overs. The Populists will hold the balance of
power in the joint assembly, which insures
the election of a silver United States Senator
to succecl Palmer. Altgeld will lead the ticket
in Chicago and the laboring centers ouUide.
Bryan will probably run ahead in the agricul
tural districts.
Chairman Hitch of the Republican
State Central Committee gave to the
United Associated Presses to-night the
following statement as to the situation
and election probabilities in this State:
The election Tuesday will give McKinley
and the Republican State ticket the most de
cisive plurality ever kuown ln Illinois. The
claim of the Bryan people that they have a
chance of carrying Illinois is just ns absurd as
their assumption that Ohio is in doubt. The
Republican victory in this State will be so
sweeping and overwhelming as to obliterate
the free-silver heresy. Captain John R. Tan
ner will defeat Governor Altgcld by the largest
majority ever given for a Governor and the
whole State ticket will approximate closely
the vote of Major McKinley.
MISSOURI.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 31.â With the pa
rade of the Republican clubs this after
noon, a similar demonstration by the
Democratic clubs to-night and the speech
of General Palmer of the National Demo
cratic party this evening the political
campaign of 1896 is practically ended in
Missouri. Chairman Cook of the Demo
cratic State Committee declares that
Bryan will carry Missouri by 50,000 ma
jority and that the Congressional delega
tion will be about equally divided. Lon
V. Stephens, Democratic nominee for Gov
ernor, will probably be elected by 30.000
plurality over R. E. Lewis, Republican.
This is assured by the recent withdrawal
of Jones, the Populist nominee for Gov
ernor, and the allotment of four Demo
cratic Presidential Electors to the Popu
list*. Chairman Filiey of the Republican
State Committee does not concede Mis
souri for Bryan and insists that there will
be a solid Republican Congressional dele
pation from this State. He also claims
that Lewis (R.) will be elected Governor.
WYOMING.
CHEYENNE, Wye , Oct. 31.â The cam
paign in this State has been an unusually
warm one and it closes with leaders of
both parties claiming the victory. It is
certain that the result will be close and
the majority either way is likely to be
small. A m ddle-of-the-road Populist
ticket is in the field, and, although it has
been denounced by the National chair
man, will undoubtedly take votes from
the fusion nominees. The principal fight
has been between ex-Governor Oiborns,
nominee for Congress on the fusion silver
ticket, and F. W. Mondell, the Republican
incumoent. Most of the work nere has
been done by State speakers. While silver
sentiment i 3 strong here and the chances
are in favor of a victory for the fusion
ticket, the majority will not be more than
1000. Republicans declare that they have
a thorough organization and that their
polls show a safe majority for McKinley.
INDIANA.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 31.â The
campaign in Indiana closed to-night with
the return oi General Harrison from his
second tour of Indiana, and big demon
strations by both parf.es in this city.
Chairnjan Martin of the Democratic State
Committee, figures that Bryan wiii carry
the State by 40,000. He says he expects
20,000 Populist votes, the fusion being sat
isiactory, 10,000 silver Republican votes
and 8000 Prohibition votes. From this be
deducts 5000, his estimate of the gold
Democrats' votes, thus obtaining the re
sult of 40,000. The Republican managers
claim the State by from 50,000 to 60,000.

ties, based upon their last poll, giving tne
Democrats 60 per cent of this doubtful
vote, gives the State to McKinley by
'2tj, 660, elects nine of the thirteen Repub
lican candidates for Congress and gives
the Republicans ninety of the one hundred
and fifty members of the Legislature on
joint ballot. The Democrats claim eight
of the Congressmen ana a majority in the
Legislature, due to fusion in thirty-nine
legislative districts.
NORTH DAKOTA.
FARGO, N. D., Oct. 31.â Never in the
history of the State has so much interest
been taken in politics. Chairman Cooper
of the State Republican Committee is con
fident of the success of the State ticket as
well as the Presidential ticket. The Re
puolicar.s claim the State at this time by
2500 mnjority. Polis have been taken
and this is a conservative estimate.
Chairman Kleinogle of the fusion
State Committee is equally as confident of
! victory as the leaders of the other 9idÂ«
i and claims the State for Bryan by 3000.
Fusion in this State has been perfected
as never before, and as no candidates for
I Palmer and Buckner electors have been
j put in the held it will make the situation
more harmful to the Republican party.
The Republicans ar* tirm in the belief
that they will carry the Congressional and
National ticket by a large majority.
MONTANA.
BTJTTE, Mont., Oct. 31.â 1t is generally
conceded that the entire State fusion
ticket will be elected in Montana and that
Bryan will carry the State, and Congress
man Hartman, the silver Republican can
didate, will be re-elected over O. F. God
dard, gold, by 15,000 majority.
ARKANSAS.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 31.â The
election in Arkansas next Tuesday will be
for eight electors and six Congressmen,
the State election having occurred in Sep
tember. A solid Democratic Congres
sional delegation will probably be re
turned. The Republicans have fall elec
toral and Conarressional tickets in the field.
The Populists made no nomination for
Congress and will supDort the Democratic
candidates except in Congressman Me-
Rae's distriot. J. R. Sovereign, one of the
fusion electors, is ineligible ou account of
his failure to pay his polltax. The
Governor claims the power to uanae his
successor and will do so after the election.
The Republicans will contest the riarht of
the Governor to do so and the courts will
be called upon to settle the question.
MINNESOTA.
ST. PAUL, Mihn., Oct. 31.â The cam
paign in Minnesota practically closed to
night in a big snowstorm. The leading
address to-night was by Roswell P.
Flower in St. Paul in the interest of Palmer
and Buckner. No contest ever brought so
many speakers to Minnesota. Both the
Republicans and the fusionists profess to
be very confident of success. Chairman
of the Republican Executive Committee
Bixby Baid that McKinley would carry
Minnesota by 35,000, Clouerh for Governor
by 20,000 and the Republican party would
certainly securo six of the Congressman
and possibly seven.
At Democratic headquarters everybody
was confident. Chairman Rosing 'said:
'Just say that Minnesota is going for
Bryan. His majority will not be less
than 15,000. Mr. Lind will be elected
Governor by 30.000. We shall also carry
the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and
Seventh Congressional districts and the
Legislature."
There has been complete fusion on the
part of the Democrats, Populists and tree
silver Republicans on eiectoriai, State
ticket and Legislature.
LOUISIANA.
NEW ORLEANS, La., Oct. 31.âReli
able information from all the parishes of
Louisiana indicates that the election on
Tuesday will result as follows: Bryan's
majority in the State will be 35,000 or
40,000. The four Populist electors who are
on the regular Democratic ticket, as a re
sult of tho fusions of the Democrats and
Populists, will cast their votes for Bryan
and Watson, leaving four electoral votes
to be cast for Bryan and Sewail by Louis
iana. The Republicans have a good chance
to carry the Third District.
ALABAMA.
BIRMINGHAM. Ala., Oct. 31.â A con
servative estimate, considerably below
that of Chairman Shelley of the campaign
committee, places Bryan's majority at
40,000. The middle-of-the-road element
will stick to Watson, but its strength has
been overestimated.
FLORIDA.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct. 31.â The
indications are that Florida will give her
four electoral votes to Bryan and Sewail
-next Tuesday, though the gold Democrats
and Republicans express themselves as
not without hope.. The Legislature,
which i? overwhelmingly Democratic, will
elect a successor to Senator McCall.
VIRGINIA.
RICHMOND, Va., Oct. 3Lâ Virginia
votes Tuesday for Presidental electors and
Congressmen only, and the prospect is
that a very large vote will be brought ont.
The canvass has been one of the most
heated in years, and personal feeliug has
entered very largely into it, especially be
tween the regular and the National Demo
crats. Both the Republican and Demo
cratic parties claim the State on the
National ticket, but will give no figures.
There is hardly reason for doubt, how
ever, that it will co Democratic.
TEXAS.
AUSTIN, Tex.. Oct. 3L-J. W. Blake,
chairman of the State Democratic Execu
tive Committee, says that Bryan and
Sewail will undoubtedly carry this State
by at least 60,000 majority. Furthermore,
he says every Democratic nominee for
Congress will be elected, and the State
ticket will receive a very large pluralty.
| The Republican Committee, however, is
inclined to doubt these claims as to ma
jorities, and say that there will be a sur
prise for the Democracy when the ballots
are counted.
Inasmuch as fusion was arranged be
tween the silver Republicans and Popu
lists there does not appear to be much
room for speculation as to whether Bryan
will secure the electoral vote from the
Lone Star State. McKinley. it is be
lieved, will hardly receive 200.000 votes out
of a possible total of 475.000. It looks as
though Cuiberson(D.) for Governor will
be defeated by Kearby (Pop.), due to the
Republican and sound money Democratic
vote going for him. The sound money
men claim they will elect three Congress
men.
KANSAS.
TOPEKA, Kas., Oct. 31â Tho Demo
crats and Popnlists who have fused on
State, electoral and Congressional tickets
claim the State by not less than 20,000.
The Republican managers issued a state
ment to-night in which the electoral vote
is claimed for McKinley by 10,000 major
ity. The fusion forces say they will carry
four and possibly five of the Congres
sional districts, and elect a Legislature
that will choose a free-silver man for the
United States Senate.
MASSACHUSETTS;
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 31. -Never before
in its political history has the Democratic
party of this State found itself in such a
lamentable condition upon the eve of an
election as now. Divided against itselt
upon the currency question, and a^ain di
video upon matters concerning the State
party organization, it is in such a state
that no reliable estimate of its strength in
the coming election can be obtained. No
Democrat imagines for a moment that
Williams will be elected Governor, and
there are those who say that be will not
even carry Boston.
In the Congressional fight the Ninth
District (Fitzgerald's) is the only one of
which the Democrats feel sure. Tbe Re
publicans predict a very largely increased
plurality for their tickets, both National
and State. By some it is estimated that
Wolcott's plurality will reach nearly
100,000. As to Congressmen, the Repub
licans claim eleven of tbe thirteen dis
tricts as a foregone conclusion, with a
fighting chance in the other two.
NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 31.â The two
great parties have concluded the work of
the campaign and their headquarters were
practically closed last night. The Repub
lican leaders are full of hope and pui their
majority at 200.000. Charles W. Hackett,
I chairman of the Republican State Com
mittee, thinks McKiniey's plurality will
be 300,000, and expects to elect sound
money Congressmen in every ono of the
j thirty-four Congressional districts. He
; believes Frank S. Black, sound-money
Democrat for Governor, will be elected,
although by a somewhat smaller plurality
than that for McKinley. He is of the
opinion that New York will give at least
60,000 plurality for McKinley.
EUiott Danforth, chairman of the Demo
cratic State Commitiee, disputes this,
j however, and says Bryan and Sewail will
I carry th<> State. The campaign in this
j city, barring to-day's big celebration, was
i one of the quietest ever Known. Tarn
! many Hall, notwithstanding the defection
of many of its prominent men, carried or
a faithful and active campaign against al
most insurmountable odds. National
Democrats of prominence last night issued
an address to Democrats appfaline to
them to cast their votes for Palmer and
Buckner rather than for McKinley, This
was based on the fact that in this State
"the success of sound money is sure," and
it says tne most favorable outcome of the
campaign will be a large Palmer vote so
that the Democrats of the country will
hereafter stand on Democratic ground.
NEW JERSEY.
TRENTON, N. J., Oct. 3Lâ The contest
in this State has been a bitter one, and
the situation at its close is very complex.
L. F. Fuller, chairman of the People's
party , executive committee, claims that
Bryan will carry the State by a comfort
able majority.bat this the Republicans
dispute. With; the Vice-Presidential
nominee a resident of this State they
claim tiiat ; the carrying of the State for
McKinley and Hobart is an assured fact,
VERMONT.
MONTPELIER, Vt., Oct. 31.â 1t is not
expected that Vermont, which has been
for years classed in the sure Republican
States, will furnish anything of a sensation
next Tuesday. - The chairman of the State
Central Committee placis McKinley's ma
jority at 20,000.
NEW HAMPSHIRE.
CONCORD, N. H., Oct. 31.â The utmost
confidence is felt at Republican headquar
ters. ' McKinley's plurality is fixed at
20,000, with a probability of these figures
being increased. The "Legislature will
show Republican gains, and they expect a
two-thirds majority in each branch. â 
SOUTH DAKOTA.
YANKTON, 8. D., Oct. 31.â The Re
publican managers claim the State by a
majority of 10,000. Chairman Elliott* of
the Republican State Central Committee
and National Commit tee ruan Kittredge
estimate the electioa ot ninety-three out
of 126 members of the Legislature, which
insures the election of a Republican to
succeed KyJe.
TENNESSEE.
MEMPHIS, Texk., Oct. 31.â Both par
ties are laying claims to Tennessee, the
Republicans by a majority of 8000 to 15,000
and the Democrats from 30,000 to 50,000.
So far as the National ticket la concerned
there is no question of Democratic success,
despite the efforts of a few Populist lead
ers to deliver much of that party's vote to
the Republicans. As between ex-Gov
ernor R. L. Taylor and G. H. Tillman,
Democratic and Republican Gubernatorial
candidates respectively, the situation is
badly mixed, yet the former in his cam
paign has been accorded every evidence
of heroic support by his party. There is
no fusion on'Prcsidential electors.
MISSISSIPPI.
JACKSON, Miss., Oct. 31.â Mississippi,
never looked upon as doubtful, has experi
enced a quiet campaign except when dis
turbed by rival candidates for Congress.
State Cnairman Miller claims it for the
Democracy by 75,000. It has only straight
tickets.
PFNNSYLVANIA.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Oct. 31.â The
Presidential campaign in Pennsylvania
nas not been a particularly active one.
.Bryan has made speeches at Philadelphia
and Pittsburg and also at some of the
smaller towns in the western part of the
State. Generals Palmer and Buckner
spoke at a meeting in Philadelphia and
ex Postm !Ster-General Wanamaker has
made numerous speeches throughout the
State.
The election in this State is for Presi
dential electors, two Congressmen at
large, twenty-eight district Congressmen,
twenty-five State Senators (a half of that
body) and 204 members of the House of
Representatives â the full membership.
Tho new Legislature will elect a United
States Senator to succeed J. Donald Cam
eron, whose term will expire March 4,
1897.
Tne Republicans will undoubtedly have
a large majority in the State for their
electors and for the two Congressmen-at
large, and, it is believed, will elect at least
twenty-four of the twenty-eight district
Congressmen.
MARYLAND.
BALTIMORE, Mr>., Oct. 31.â The lead
ers of the two big parties continue to claim
everything, but conservative Democrats
acknowledge that the State wLI in all
probability give its electoral vote to Mc-
Kinley by upwards of 10,000 plurality.
The only uncertain element in the State
is the labor vote in Baltimore.
The indications also point to the certain
election of four Republican Congressmen,
which would be an increase of one. It is
possible that they may gain two. The
only district of which the Democrats are
sure is the First.
MAINE.
PORTLAND, Me., Oct. 81.â Since the
September election nothing has been done
in politics m Maine, both parties slacking
their exertion*. The four Congressmen
being already elected by an agreed
plurality of 49.500, no other element than
choice of Presidential electors comes into
the struggle, and the election will be quiet
and orderly. McKinley will probably get
50,000 majority.
GEORGIA.
ATLANTA, Ga., Oct. 31.â The result in I
Georgia is problematical. The Popolis s, ;
having withdrawn their electoral ticket j
in Mr. Watson's own State, the Bryan and !
Sewail euctors will receive not only the
practically solid vote of the Democrats, ;
but also a great many from the Populists, i
It is not believed "that the Palmer ana
Buckner ticket in this State will poll as !
many as 5000 votes.
McKinley will get the solid vote of the
Republicans. It is estimated that the
Democratic plurality will be approxi
mately 50,000, the Democratic State ticke;
receiving 56,000 majority in the October
elections. There seems to be no doubt
that every Democratic nominee for Con
gress will be elected.
WEST VIRGINIA.
WHEELING, W. Va., Oct. 31.-Chair
man M. O. Dawaon ot the Republican
Committee claims West Virginia by 15.000,
and Chairman Edmiaton of the Demo
cratic Committee by from 8000 to 10,000.
The chances seem to favor the Repub
licans, a* they have had the beat organiza
tion in the history of the State. ThÂ«
Democrats figure that the defection in the
party will be offset by a gain among free
silver Republican farmers and among
laboring men.
OREGON.
PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 31.â The cam
paign, in Oregon pract cally closed this
evening. Both sides have put forth every
effort to canvass the interior portion of the
State, and it is an open questi n whether
Oregon has been removed from the list of
doubtful States. Tne showing of the Popu
lists in the election last June, when the
Republican Congressional candidates nar
rowly escaped defeat, has terved to mend
the breach in local I opublican ranks and
a most determined fisjht has been waged.
Conservative Republican managers esti
mate McKinley's majority at from 3500 to
5000, while the f sionists and Populists
claim for Bryan from 2000 to 2225. The
Republicans depend upon Multnomau
County and Portland to give McKinley 'e
majority. Both the D ?mocratic and Popu
list committees drew down the electors
nominated in April and nut up a ticket
containing one Democrat, one Populist
and two Silver Republicans. The effect of
this has been to alienate both Democrats
and Populists, each claiming to have been
sold out to the other. It is really not a
complete fusion. There are no Demo
cratic electors except the ticket for Palmer
and Buckuer.
The Populists complain they were sold
out to the Democrats here and their elec
tors withdrawn, and they cannot vote a
straight Populist ticket. The Silver Re
publicans, People's party and Democrats
indorsed silver candidates, and they ap
pear on the ticket as the Bryan Union
Bimetallic party. In the last election
three Representatives to the Legislature
were elected on this ticket. The impor
tant question in Oregon is whether Sen
ator Mitchell will be returned to the
United States Senate next spring.
WASHINGTON.
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 31.â The cam
paign in this State closed to-day. Each
side predicts victory for both State and
National candidates. Indications, how
ever, point to Bryan carrying the State.
There is perfect fusion of Populists, Demo
crats and Free-silver Republicans under
the name of the People's party ticket.
Secretary Thomas Maloney of the fusion
campaign committee estimates Bryan's
majority in Washington at 15,000, that
John R. Rogers, fusion gubernatorial can
didate, will have 13,000, and that James
Hamilton Lewis and W. C. Jones, fusiou
Congressional candidates, will have large
majorities. Speaking for the Republicans
of Washington Scott Swetland, chairman
of the State Central Committee, give 3 the
following : McKinley, 4500; Potter Charles
Sullivan, gubernatorial candidate, 5500;
8. C. Hyde and W. H. Doolittl*, Congres
sional candidates, 4500 each. The guber
natorial contest will be close.
NEVADA.
CARSON, Nev., Oct. 3Lâ The Silver-
Democratic fusion managers claim Nevada
for Bryan Dy 5000 plurality. The Repub
licans claim Bryan's plurality wiii not ex
ceed 2500 and that the Republican candi
dates on the State ticket will poll one-third
more votes than McKiniey. The Repub
licans have hopes of Murphy's election for
Justice of the Supreme Court. The Popu
lists claim that J. C. Doughty will defeat
Consressman N^wlands. Ormsby, Doug
las, Storey and Washoe counties will go
Republican on tbe legislative ticket.

McKINLEY'S GAIN IN LOS ANGELES.
He : Will Carry the County by a Ma
jority of at Least For*-
Thousand..
LOS â  ANGELES, Cal.. : Oct. 31.â The
most surprising slump ever known in any
campaign has taken place here during the
past few days, to the demoralization of
the Popocrats. Scores of Democrats who
have said nothing Heretofore have come
courageously to tlae front and announced
I their determination to vote lor McKinley,
I McLachlan and the Republican county and
! legislative tickets. McLachlan is likely
j to have a majority of 10,000 in his district,
wh ile every Popocratic candidate for the
Assembly in this county is sure of defeat.
The second poll of voters in a greater
j part of this county has been completed
and shows the most grati.yinp; strength
for the Republican ticket. The lirst pell
indicated a Republican majority in the
county of 1500, bur. owing to the" remark
able slump to McKinley, the later one in
dicates a majority of 4000, while the nom
inal Republican majority is oniy 2000 in
the county. The canvass was made by
non-partisans, with instructions not to say
to the people lor which party the informa
tion was sought, and it must, therefore,
be regarded as absolutely reliable.
Comparisons have been made with
neighboring counties, with the result that
it may be safely predicted that McKinley
wiii go to the Tehachapi with 10,000 ma
jority.
The State Leaeue of Republican Clubs,
which has its headquarters hers, has not
been idle along the lines of securin â¢ polls
and makin : estimates. Conservative tis
ures for the State given out to-day place
15.000 majority in the McKinloy column.
The registration in this county has in
creased from 25,000 to 41.000 since 1894. A
member of the Republican County Cam
paign Committee authorizes the publica
tion of trie following estimates for the city
and county of Los Angeles:
My estimate of the vote in the city is as fol
low*: McKinley, 11,000; Bryan, 8300; Lev
ering, 900; Palmer, 300. Total, 20,500. I*
My estimate of the vote in the county out. J
side of the city is as follows: McKinley, 7400;
Bryan, 0000; Levering, 1100. Total, 14,500. I
This would make the total vote in Los An
geles County as follows: McKinley, 18,4OO;
Bryan. 143J0; Lfvuring, 2000; Palmer, 300J
total, 33,000; McKinley's plurality, 4100; Mo
Kinley's majority over all, 1800.
This estimate is made from as thorough a
knowledge of th-jÂ« situation in Los Angeles
County as it iÂ« possible to obtain and from a
careful study of the vote in former polls.
A Surprise nt San Xtii*.
SANLUISOBISPO,CAL.,Ocr.3I.â At the
silver rally in this city to-night, a demon
stration for McKinley took place that waa
as unexpected to the Popocrats as it was
spontaneous. The speaker, Barlow, had
begun one of his characteristic harangues,
and after the applause at. the mention of
Bryan's name Had subsided, referred to
William McKinley and then paused, finally
paying in a sneering way : "I am waiting
for the applause." The reply was startling
and instantaneous. As one man that bisr
audience, ba!f of whom wore the yellow
badge of eood Government, arose and
yelled for McKinley, and they kept it up,
too. uatil the paralyzed speaker had time
to recover himself and proceed with nis
speech.CLOSING OF THE

CANTON, Ohio, Oct. 31.â With many a
ringing cheer and many a stirring air
from two score bands, the last great day
of the campaign at the home of the Re
publican candidate came to an end. Sen
ator-electForafter contributed handsomely
tc the brilliant close of what has been the
most interesting day ot the campaign.
Major McKinley met Senator Foraker at
the station at 5 o'clock, and when some
one proposed three cheers for the distin- j
guished guest, Major McKinley took off
bis hat and led the cheering. It wag dark
when Senator Foraker reached the McKin
ley house, but a great crowd awaited him.
He made hii ninety-seventh speech of the
campaign from the platform in McKinley's
yard and he told the people some news
from the West that made them shout with
joy.
Senator Foraker said:
1 did not come here with the idea of making
a speech, but simply with a view of congratu
lating your distinguished fellow-townsman
upon the great honor that will be his next j
Tuesday evening [cheers]; and congratulating j
him, too, upon the magnificent manner in !
which he has deported himself during the
progress of this campaign. When I presented
his name to the St. Louis convention I used
some pretty stroug language as to what kind
of a candidate he would make [laughter aud
applause]; but I did ii without any hesitation, |
for I knew the man, ana I knew he would re
deem every promise I might make. And now
at the end of the contestâ the most memorable
at least since the war. and probably without a
precedent in all the history of the country â at
the end of over five months of intense excite
ment for tne whole people; at the end of a
time when he has Deen called upon daily by
great delegations of every character and
class from every section of the country, to all
of whom he has spoken, we can say without
any hesitation or any qualification that
throughout he has borne himself in such a
manner as to inspire the people of the whole
country with a sense of his fitness for the chief
magistracy of the United States. [Cheers.]
He has made numberless speeches and every
one of them has been a gem â concise, argu
mentative, strong and convincing. As a con
sequence, we can siy next Tuesday nightâ
and he can take that to himself nowâ that
when he has been elected he himself wfll have
done mo"-o by far than any other one man to
bring about that result.
When Senator Foraker left him to take ,
the train for Cleveland, where he speaks
to-ni^ht, a storm of cheers followed him.
He was in Canton just forty minutes.
Major McKinley began speaking at an
early hour this morning ana was kept busy
talking and receiving callers until sunset.
One of his first utterances this morning
was appropriate to the day. Addressing a
delegation of his old friends from Waynes
borg, in this county, he said:
I thank you that you have come on this
glorious day, when the glorious banner of the
free waves from every home and hilltop ot the
land and from every farm and fireside of our
common country. Glorious old banner it is.
So long as we carry it in our hands and have
what it typifies in our hearts the Republic and
our splendid free institutions will be forever
eecure.
The largest delegation that has vicited
Canton came this afternoon. It was from
Youngstown and other places in the Ma
honing Valley, and numbered 9000 people,
2000 of whom were women. It took this
splendid Mahoning Valley delegation
more than an hour to pass in review be
fore Major McKinley. Wnen the parade
came to a halt and the people massed
themselves in the streets and yard about
Major McKinley's house, the Republican
candidate looked down upon the greatest
and most inspiring audience that has
greeted him. In addition to the visiting
delegation there-svere thousands of other
people pressing toward the stands.
Every man, woman and child carried a
flag, and when Major McKinley rose to
(speak each flag waved and a great chorus
of cheers rolled like a surge of the sea up
and down the densely -packed streets.
Major McKinley had a prepared speech in
his hand which he hadexpt-cted to deliver,
but he could not do it. He was caught up
in the wave of enthusiasm which swirled
and eddied about him. He tossed the
manuscript aside, and spoke, as be after
ward said, "just what was in his heart."
What he said was echoed in 10.000
hearts. When he declared, "There is just
one class under our flag, and we all belong
to it," such a cheer went up as Canton
never heard before.
The call of several thousand Canton
women upon Major McKinley was another
beautiful incident of a day that has been
pregnant with nnique and stirring events.
The weather was delightful, and the cam
paign could not have closed more bril
iiantJy and beautifully.
LAST OFFICIAL APPEAL
Chairman Banna Issues a Ringing Ad
dream to the Volera.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 31.â M. A. Hanna
made his last official appeal to the voters
and denunciation oi the combined oppo
sition as chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee to-night as follows:
The earnest support which the loyal citizens
of the United States, irrespective of former
political affiliations, have rendered the Repub
lican party end the cause of sound money in
the campaign about to end justifies an expres
sion from those who have been called upon to
conduct it.
No campaign since the War of the Rebellion
has presented such grave responsibilities to
those entitled to the elective franchise. The
dangerous principles enunciated by the Chi
cago platform, which proposes not only a de
basement of the currency but the destruction
of the highest Judicial authority of the land,
have justified good citizens, irrespective of
past party preferences, in uniting to rebuke
those who wonid thus endanger the very foun
dation of our National organization.
Abandoning their time-honored principles
a strict construction of the constitution, the
supporters of that platform propose a system
which endangers the very life of the constitu
tion and of the nation itself. The proper en
forcement of law, recognition of the highest
tribunal of the land, the maintenance of the
high and unvarying standard of our medium
of exchange, the payment of obligations, pub- j
lie and private, in a currency equal to that
contemplated when they were msde, are ail
repudiated and denounced, botu by the plat
form and the candidate placed upon it. The
appeals to prejudice, to selfishness and to
passion; the efforts to array the employed
against the employer and labor against that
which furnishes him with desired labor, have
led good citizens, without respect to party
lines, and thoughtful workingmen, irre
spective of the class of their employment, to
array themselves against the methods which
would endanger Government and property
rights and the employment which they guar
antee.
It is gratifying to know that tho two classes
of citizens to whom these appeals have been
most strongly directedâ the farmers and the
workingmen of the cities and townsâ have re
sented the Imputations which have been
placed upon them by theassumption that they
desire to deal falsely with those with whom
they have business relations or with the
people of the Nation. The proposition that
the farmer may repudiate a portion of his
obligations by the coinage of a dollar worth
but half that which he agreed to pay has been
as indignantly rejected as that which assumes
that the workingman held principles which he
was ashamed to avow and which are danger
ous to the peace of the Kalion.
The developments of the clossng week of the
campaign leave no doubt that the overwhelm
ing majority of the people of the Nation is
against the platform and candidate of repu
diation and National dishonor.
It is hoped that all good citizens will join
bauds on Tuesaay in maintaining the honor
of the Nation by registering their ballots in
favor of that candidate who has been hon
ored by the support of loyal men of all
parties, William McKinley. The issue is be
tween two men ana two platforms, the one
representing National honor, good govern
ment, sound money and sound principles; the
other standing for doctrines dangerous to the
peace and prosperity of the Nation, and prom
ising only a system which must debase the
currency, destroy business and end employ
ment, it is, as lias been recently said by
Major McKinley himself, a time when the
voice of the partisan is hushed In the chorus
of patriotism, which sounds from one end of
the country to the oiber. M. A. Hanka.
Chairman Republican National Committee.

Everywhere in Indiana the General
Caused Hrrat Enthusiasm,
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 31.âGen

utes.
Another brief run brought the party to
Kendalville, where a crowd of about 5000
nad packed themselves about a stand
erected a few yards from the station.
The Republicans of Noble County bad
prepared for an all-day rally and had just
finished with a parade something over a
mile long. In the crowd was a big sound
money club of Lake Shore employes with
a number of original transparencies. Gen
eral Harrison was escorted to the stand by
the reception committee, who had boarded
the train at Waterloo, and was received
with prolonged cheering. Near the stand

I 6000 men in line.
Large crowds turned out at Wabash,

IS THE WIDOW OF ROCHE
Quite a Fortune Inherited by a Handsome
Young Woman From San
Francisco.
LEADVILLE, Colo., Oct. 31.â About a
month ago J. A. Roche, a wealthy real
estate dealer, died in this city. He was
supposed to have been unmarried and
left all his property to his mother and a
cousin.
Not long ago a handsome yonng woman
reached here from San Francisco, claim
ing to be Mrs. Megiveny. wife of Roche.
She put her case in the hands of a promi
nent attorney and has established the fact
that she is the widow of Roche and that
the laMer'B real name was Megiveny, but
that this fact was only known to a few
friends.
The couple were married in 1894, but
did not live happily and the wife went to
the Pacific Coast intending to sue fo* a
divorce. Fortunately she did not apply
for a divorce and a decree of the court gives
her half of the estate, which is reputed to
j be worth 3*50,000.

Support.

Is a Cure for All Their
Troubles.

COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa, Oct. 31.â The
last day of the la3t week in William J.
Bryan's memorable electioneering tour
ended to-nieht in a bJaze of fireworks and
a wild vent of enthusiasm. To-morrow
the Democratic candidate will rest at his
Lincoln home and on Monday he will
make his final assault on the Republican
defenses, devoting the entire day to his
own State and concluding hia extraordi
nary campaign at Omaha in the evening.
All through lowa to-day the head of the
Chicago ticket saw the golden danger sig
nal of what he has termed "the yellow
fever." At nearly every town visitÂ»d in
his trip across the State from the time he
entered it, early in the morning, until he
reached the banks of the Missouri, after
dark, he found material evidence of Re
publican sentiment displayed through de
vices emblematic of the gold standard.
At some places th? atmosphere took on a
decided orange tint. Men and women,
boys ana girls, even babies carried in the
arms of their mothers, were attired in
golden regalia.
So far was the intention to make the
Democratic candidate realize that his op
ponents were active and of no mean num
ber carried out at some points where he
appeared that men attired completelj' in
yellow placed themselves conspicuously
before his eyes, and others wearing badges
inscribed "Sound Money" interrupted his
remarks with cries for the Republican
standard-bearer.
Osceoia, Chariton and Red Oak made
the most notable displays of the orange.
At the last-named place shouts for Mc-
Ivinley from the crowd Mr. Bryan was
addressing met with responses more em
phatic than goldy â so emphatic that the
counter demonstration was abandoned.
At Osceoia, too, a disposition to make the
nominee uncomfortable was shown. He
was equal to the occasion, however, and
bis reply brought delighted shouts irorn
his followers.
But displays of golden emblems and at
tempts to embarrass the man from Ne
braska did not constitute the entire story
of the journey through the State. It was
a day of remarkable crowds, of wild en
thusiasm, of a venting of that surplus po
litical emotion which the close of the
campaign made necessary.
If Major McKiniey'a friends were anx
ious to show their loyalty, so were the
supporters of Mr. Bryan as earnest in
their desire toward their leader. The
demonstrations for the young Democratic
standard-bearer were extraordinary. He
was cheered from one end of lowa to the
other with a heartiness that could not be
mistaken. As a rule the wearers of the
yellow contented themselves with making
their display in the neighborhood oi the
candidate's special train or along the
streets through which he passed, while
his own people composed the big throngs
that congregated to hear him exi>ound
the doctrine of 16 to 1. Brass bands,
young women in costumes of white and
silver marching clubs and a liberal dis
play of Bryan badges all had their part
in the demonstrations.
Twenty-one speeches, including three at
Ottumwa and four here to-night, consti
tuted the day's record. The others were
made at Mount Pleasant, Fair field. Bata
via, Albia, Chariton, Osceoia, Creston,
Corning, Villisca, Red Oak, Hastings,
Malvern, Glenwood and Pacific Junction.
Mr. Bryan's second address at. Ottumwa
was the most important of the day. It.
was devoted to summing up the cam
paign and caused the hearers to become
wild with enthusiasm.
Yellow and more of it was at Osceoia,
where Mr. Bryan addressed about 5000
people from a stand erecWd in front of the
courthouse. Tne meeting was interrupted
by shouts for McKinley, and the Demo
cratic candidate said a few words in reply
that brought loud cheers from his sup
porters.
Two addresses were made to big crowds
at Creston, the first in an open lot and
the other in the opera-house. Golden
ribbons were again conspicuous, but both
audiences showed great enthusiasm. In
the second speech Mr. Bryan said:
Mr. Chairman, Ladles and Gentlemen: We
â¢re now about at the close of a memorable
campaign, a campaign iv which greater issues
are involved than were ever involved in a
campaign in the United States In time of
peace. We have passed through a campaign
which has aroused a deeper feeling than has
been aroused by a campaign in this country
in time of peace. We have come to the close
oiki k campaign that has witnessed more un
selfish devotion to a cause than has ever been
witnessed in any campaign in this country in
time of peace. [Great cheering.)
Men who have never spoken before in public
hvve gone forth in this campaign because
their l.carts were so full of the truth that they
could not maintain silence. [Great cheering.]
If they had wiped from the face of the earth
every man who had made a public speech
before we would have had sufficient of public
spcakiug from these new men, who have dem
onstrated that eloquence in the speech of one
who knows what ha id talking about and be
lieves what he says. [Gieat cheering.] The
time has now come for you to sit in judgment
as sovereigns of the greatest nation on earth
and ali we a>k of you is that you shall make
your votes represent what you believe. The
cause of bimetallism has grown every day of
this campaign. [Cheers.]
There has not been one backward step.
There has not been a single moment when
there was a cessation in .he progress of the
cause, and why? Because our cause is jugt
and our arguments unanswerable. [Great
cheering.] I claim no credit for the wont that
has been done. Bimetallism has not grown
because I advocated it. but my candidacy has
prospered because 1 attached myself to a prin
ciple which 1b right.
My friends, bimetallism appeals to all. Our
opponent* have accused us of arraying class
against class, and yet to them belongs the dis
credit of making more appeals to classes'
sectional prejudice tnan any party ha* ever
done in the past. [Great cheering.] They have
tried to array the money-loaner against the
man who borrows money. They have tried to
array the merchant against his customers ; they
have tried to array the wage-earners of this
country against the farmers and the financiers
against the rest of the people and the roldiers
against their country. [Great cheering.]
There is not a class to which they hare not
appealed. Aye, they have even gone into re
ligion and nave appealed to missionary soci
eties and to church boards and told them that
the free coinage of silver wonld lessen the
value of their investments. [Cheers.] My
friends, our appeal has been to the great pro
ducing masses and to those who believe that
the prosperity of the Nation must begin with
those who toil and find its way upward through
the other cUisses of society. [Wild cheering.]
We have tried to appiy the doctrines oi
bimetallism to all of the people of this country,
and we insist theri is only one class of people
who benefit by the gold standard, and that is
the cUu which trades in money and owns
money and grows rich A3 the people grow poor.
[Great cheering.]
Bimetallism appeals to the farmers of this
Nation because they have suffereii from fall
ing prices wnile their debts and taxes refuse
to fall [cheers], and we are trying to restore
bimetallism and then maintain the parity be
tween a dollar and proDerty. [Great cheer
ing.] Bimetallism is good for the wage
earner because it makes It more profitable
to invest money in enterprises and in the
employment of labor than to lock It up in a
vault and gain the rife in the value of dollars. |
[Great cheering.] Bimetallism gives to the j
laboring man an opportunity to work and we 1
point to the fact that in nil the times past a
laboring man has been more ttrosperous when
two jobs of work were looking for one man
than when two men were looking for one job
of work. [Great cheering.]
Bimetallism appeals to the businessmen in
this country, because business failures, in
creasing everywhere, testify to the fact that
the merchant cannot sell when people are not
able to buy. [Great cheering.] We want to
increase the cousumirg capacity ot the Amer
ican people and have meney in the country
for the people to get when they sell their crops
and to spend in the purchase of food and
clothing for their families.
The tjold standard has separated the month
from the money to buy food for it. It
has separated tne back to be clothed
from the purse that contains the money
to buy clothing. We want to close the
gap between gold and Bilver and also want to j
close the gap between need and money to
supply the needs of the human race. [Caeer- j
ing.] Bimetallism appeals to the professional i
man because the professional man lives upon |
thoso who produce the wealth of thiÃ country !
and upon those v ho exchange wealth. Â«nd v]
he destroys the foundation he destroys his
prosperity. [Cheer?.] Bimetallism appeals to !
the soldier, because the soldier who was wilt
ing to give his life if need be to make this one i
Nation is willing to give his vote this year to
iuÃke this Nation an independent Nation and
not a province ot some foreign empire. [Great
cheering.]
Our cause appeals to the minds of those I
who think and the hearts o! those who
feel, while the gold standard, when rightly
understood, appeal* only to those who
love money more than they do man- â 
kind. [Wild cheering.] I want you to re
member that no evil was ever reformed by
ttioso who profited by the evil; that no bad |
law was ever repealed by those who obtained j
the benefit oi the bad law; that no vicious
system was ever corrected by those who
profited by the vicious system; andso in this
campaign, the people who have grown rich â ,
from the goid standard have banded them
selves to maintain it, and we must appeal to
those who have suffered in order to obtain re- j
lief from the g'-l'l standard. [Great cheering.]
Now, mv friends, we have tried to make an ]
appeal to the people of tnis country. I have
tried to do my than. [Cries of, "Yes, you
have."] I have worked as hard as I conld, and
yet I don't want you to think that my physical
strength is exhausted. [Wild cheering.]
My hnnd has been used until jt is sore, but
yet it can handle a pen to sign a free coinage
biil if lam elected. [Great cheering and cries
of "You will be."] 1 have been wearied with
work, but, my friends, 1 still have the physical
strength to stand between the people, ii they
elect me, and the Wall-street syndicates, which
havo been bleeding this country. [Wild and
continued cheering. "You are elected,"
shouted a voice. More wild cheering. ]
My iriends, you have been told that I am a
dangerous man. [Laughter.] There is noth
ing in try past life, public or private, that
justifies any citizen in saying that my election
would be a menace to law and order, or to our
form of government, or to the weliare ot so
ciety, hut there is much in what I have said
aud'done to create a suspicion that my election
would be a nienai-e to those who have been
living on what other people have earned.
[Loud cheer*. A voice: "Dangerous to Wa.l
street." Cheers.]
My friends, I believe in the cause for which
I speak. 1 never have claimed infallibility,
but I have claimed tnis, that when I believe a
thing I stand by it. [Cheers.] Audi believe j
in the restoration of bimetallism, and if I
have behind me the hearts as well as the I
votes of the American people, you may de
pend upon it that no power in this country or
In any other nation, will prevent the opening
of our mints to the free coinage of silver on |
equal terms with gold at the present ratio, j
[Great cheering.]
I appreciate the work that has been done in
this campaign; I appreciate the words that
nave been spoken and the zeal which has
Deen shown; anil the sacrifices which have
been made, and I appreciate ihe efforts which
have been put font by the wives and mothers,
a< well as the work done by the m- n. [Cheers. [
The wives and mothers have a right to feel an
Interest in the result of this campaign.
These wives and mothers are concerned as
much as we and, my friends, there is no ques
tion that appeals to the mother's heart more
than thequtstlon that is raised in this cam
paign as to whether trusts and syndicates
â hall run this Government or whether the
people themselves snail have a voice in the
making of the law They have accused me of
being a young tnm: and 1 have not attempted
to deny it. llut, my friends, as a young man f
know something of the feelings of young men
and I know what it is to have a condition in
our political society that makes it difficult for
a young man to rise in life unless he becomes
a favorite of some great corporation. [Great
cheering.) 1 want our Government main
tained as the fathers intended it. I want it so
that the child of the humblest citizen in this
land can aspire to any position in the political
or business world to which his merits entitle
him.
I want It so that if he enters politics he will
not find arrayed against tiim all those great
financial influences of society unless be is will
ing to join with them and conspire against the
welfare of the people as a whole. If be enters
business I want him to be able to stand upon
his own merits and not stand always in tne
ivar that bonie great trust will run him out of
business. [Great cheering.)
We are engaged in just such a contest as
every generation must pass through. In times
of quiet abuses spring up. When the people
neglect their civil duties those who have got
Interests gather around legislative halls and
secure legislation that grants them special
privileges and then entrench themselves be
nind the privileges granted them and contrib
ute to campaign funds in order to purchase an
election, knowing that they can get back
through unjust legislation more than they
contribute to the campaign. [Great cheering.]
The people suffer until suffering ceases to be
a virtue; they are patient until patience is ex
hausted and then they arouse themselves and
take possession of the reins of Government
and put government bsck upon its old founda
tion. [Great cheerlmt.] We are engaged in
such a struggle now, and while the flection
will turn on the money question* yet, my
friends, behind the money question stand
these other questions and behind the money
power stand all those great forces that Imve
been using the Government for public plunder.
[Wild cheering.] I know that tha forces
against us arc great, but, my friends, the con
science of the American people Is more potent
than any campaign fund which can be raised.
[Wild cheering.] I am not surprised at the
means that have been employed, because when
n party starts out on the proposition that we
mustjubmit to such a financial policy as for
eign money lenders demand, it is not strange
that they coon farther and sty that anr man
wqo borrows money shali"subraU to the dicta
tion rf the man who ioaus to him, and that
any man who works for wages must submit to
the dictation of the man who employs him.
This doctrine of submission will be carried
all the way down the line until the rieht of
the citizen is lost, and until the corporation
becomes all powerful. [Great cheering.]
The yellow ribbon which was first adopted
as a badge of submission to a foreign money
power has become a badge of coercion. [Wild
and continued cheering.] Let those wear it
who are willing to bow tne knee aud suppli
cate for assistance from across the ocean.
[Great cheering.] I expect the votes of those
only who believe that the American people
nre able to attend- n their own business.
[Great cheering.] Lot those wear it who are
willing to submit the destinies of this Nation
to those who loan us money. 1 simply ask the
votes of those who want to commit the des
tinies of seventy millions of people to those
people tin-in < i\ i.'S.
We simply ask you who live upon these
prairies and in these cities to boas indepen
dent in the casting of y'.nr vote as the Kastern
financier is always independent when he casts
his vote. He tells you he is a business man
and cannot allow party questions to interfere
with his business. 1 want you to be business
men in this campaign and from now until
election day carry as your motto, "We mean
business," and bimetallism will be restored.
Three thousand people at Corning and a
thousand at Villisca heard brief speeches.
The orange was much in evidence among
the 7000 in the gatherin X in the fair
grounds at Red Oak. Attempts were
made to embarrass Mr. Bryan by shouts
for McKinJey, but the response of silver
men in the audience was so threatening
that they desisted.
A brief stop was made at Pacific Junc
tion, when an array of horsemen carrying
torches made a picturesque feature of the
assemblage. Council Bluffs was reached
at 7 o'ciock
Thousands of wildly enthusiastic Bryan
ites filled the streets of Council Bluffi" to
night and gave the heartiest sort of a wel
come to William J. Bryan when he arrived
at 7 o'clock. The candidate and the pro
cession that escorted him to the Botany
Opero-house, where He made his first
speech, passed under a literal archway of
pyrotechnics, and^all along the route
the wild cheeririir of those in the par
ade and on the sidewalks were aug
mented by a continual firing of shot
guns held by a squad of iarmers. Tne
opera-house was crwoded to the doors and
Mr. Bryan received an ovation. He spoke
again in a big hall used as Democratic
headquarters, where most of his positive
partisan supporters hail gathered to do
him honor. A third address was made to
an assemblage that crowded a tent erected
for the purpose, and he concluded the
nignt's â peech-making and hio lowa cam
paign from a platform erected in front of
the GranU Hotel, around which a great
throng had gathered.
Mr. and Mrs. Bryan will spend the night
at the house of Mr. and Mrs. T. J. Evans,
a former Republican, and in the morning
will go to Lincoln on the nominee's special
car.

dating or attempting to intimidate any voter.
Mr. Hearst of the New York Journal, with the
patriotism and liberality which has character
ized him throughout this struggle, has offered
an additional reward of $1000 for the same

RELEASED AND REARRESTED
Baron yon I.uizotr, the Correspondent t
'..'ls let in Trouble.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 31. â Baron
'yon Lutzow, the newspaper correspondent
who was recently, arrested on the charge
of lib?iously insulting Count yon Eulen
berg, grand marshal of the court and
grand master of ceremonies, has been re
leased, but was immediately rearrested.
The arrest grew out of the reports of the
reply of the Czar to a toast offered by
Emperor "William during his Russian
Majesty's visit. The first version of the
I reply had it that the Czar vowed that he
| was inspired by the same traditional sen-
I timents as his father had been. A later
version made the; Czar. say that he was
"inspired by the same sentiments as
I your Majesty." ;
Baron yon Lutzow and Herr Lockert,
another Berlin correspondent, ascribed
the alteration in the phrasing to Count
yon Eulenberg, who . saw a political at
tack in the charge and caused the arrest
of both correspondents. Herr Lockert
was soon afterward .-. set at ' liberty, but
Baron yon : Lutzow was kept in custody
until yesterday. The : reason for his sec
ond arrest is not stated, but is undoubt
edly connected with j the original charge
against him. '.â¢.-. â -

j High School football team to-day on the

son, the Stockton fullback, was forced over
the line for a second touchdown. The
score at the end of the first half was 10 to 0
in favor of Stockton.
Jones of Stockton brought the ball back
to center when Berkeley kicked off in the
I second half, and Yost and McAUen ad
vanced it to Berkeley's five-yard line.
Carter was forced over the line and Hen
derson kicked a iroal. Score 16 to 0 in
favor of Stockton.
Henderson made two more touchdowns

PRINCE BISMARCK'S
DOUBLE DEALING
Much Fuss Being Made in
Europe Over the Recent
Disclosure.
It Causes Austria to Look With
Suspicion Upon Her Ger
man Cousin.
NEW ALLIANCES ARE IN ORDEB.
Bat the Scandal Has Created a Much
Warmer Feeling For England
by the Fatherland.
[Copyright 1896, by the New York Times.]
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 31.â Nothing could
more forcibly illustrate the anxious and
even frightened state the nations of
Europe are in than the prodigious fusa
which has been made this week, and is
still making, over Bismarck's disclosure
that from 1884 to 1890 he was dealing with
Russia behind the back* of his partners in
the triple alliance.
I call this a disclosure because that
name is given to it everywhere, but hardly
anything about it is new. Ita substance
was printed in my "Young Emperor"
book (second edition) in 1892, and waÃ
perfectly well known at the time for the
simple reason that Bismarck was engaged
in telling it to every bo iy who would
listen. So much Has Happened since,
however, that it had been forgotten, and
now when Bismarck has again got his
shouting fit on aud bawls it from the
housetops once more everybody is par
alyzed with amazement. The excitement
about this so-called revelation is, however,
purely journalistic.
The diplomats and foreign offices have
known all about it for years, and they
long ago discounted its-importance. Aus
tria at the moment is not very warmly
disposed toward her German aily, but this
reiterated proof of falseness
has litt;e to do with xhat f:ict. No Aus
trian statesman doubts t hut Emperor Wil
liam, since lie threw Bismarck out of ottice
in 1890, has behaved wnh scrupulous
honor toward his allies, so far us double
dealing with hostile powers is concerned.
The trouble now worrying Vienna and
Rome does not go back to Bismarck and
the eighties, but belongs very much to the
present. Little by little a new situation
in Europe has grown up in which the
German Empire stands to lose a great
deal, if not indeed everything, and has
nothing to offer her allies that they can
not more easily obtain lor themselves.
Italy has perceived for some time and not
without hints troni London. It may be
guessed that the German friendship for
which she pays such an enormous price is
really of more harm than good to her.
Now it is apparent that Austria is ask
ing herself if this is not true in her case, too,
and the restatement of Bismarck's treach
ery comes to inflame Austrian popular
opinion in an anti-German direction juÂ»t
at a moment when such an expression uf
public feeling provides tne Austrian for
eign office with an excuse in case it de
cides that it wants one for reconsidering
its whole policy. If any other German
than Bismarck had done such a thing as
this at such a time he would nave oeen
arrested and interned in a fortress over
night. Unhappily, Bismarck cannot be
silenced by any means summary or other.
There is a certain compensation, however,
in the fact that Germans of all classes are
shamed and distrusted by this particular
performance of his and are led to think
better of England than they aid, merely
because he declares that his one object is
to induce Germans to regard England
as their sole enemy. Not only have
the German press ceased their at
tacks on England, but we hear
of a sudden and excessive, almost
painful, affability shown by German offi
cials toward the British representatives at
Berlin. This is what might have been
predicted at any time in the past month.
William's anti-English experiment was
loredooaied to disaster. England had
always more cards to play than he could
have and his efforts to isolate her or
rather to terrify her by the menace of iso
lation have ended in his facing the likeli
hood of a concert of the powers against
himself.
M. Hanotaux is to make a speech in the
French Chamber the first of next week on
the Eastern question, instead of post
poning it. as it was at Qrst understood he
would do. This raises the presumption
that he has something weighty to say,
but expectation may easily n â¢ disap
pointed. It is not difficult to talk by the
hour on this subject, and still not to say
anything, as M. Hanotaux himself has
shown before now. It is still suspected
here, however, that the basis for an ea
glo-Franco-Russian arrangement has been
iound, and that, very possibly, England's
position In Egypt is going to be regular
ize : by inviting France to occupy
Morocco. Since that possibility was
mooted in these dispatches a week
ago, numerous hints to the same effect
have been dropped in semi-oflicial quar
ters both here and abroad, and the sugges
tion is at least as well worth keeping in
mind as anything the past fortnight has
evolved. The revelation that General Gal
lienne's new regime in Madagascar is to
mean martial law in the most comprehen
sive form makes thoughtful Frenchmen
more nervous than ever about the whole
adventure in that island. The drumhead
conviction and execution of two leading
Hovas whom General Laroche nad
specially invited to assist the French in
restoring tranquility is said to have
amazed and depressed the European resi
dents there, and it certainly raises appre
hensions in France that Madagascar will
turnout to be a bloody and ruinousin
cumbrance.
Challemel Lacour possessed such an
extraordinary capacity for personal un
hanpiness that it lons frince became his
principal claim to distinction in tne eyes
of the French public, and allusions to it
could not even be kept out of the speeches
made at his grave yesterday. When a
youth be was convicted of felony, and
though this really created influential sym
pathy for the son, and made possible his
splendid academic career, he always be
lieved that people were thinning of noth
ing else. When he rose in Gambetta's
wake to political eminence his soured tem
per and surly manners quite neutralized
the value of his notable intellect. He was
too gifted to be denied official advance
ment, but people bated him the more as
he progressed, and he returned the feeling
with increasing virulence to the end. He
was honest, and he died, as he was born
in poverty. The republic will enshrine
his memory as that of a Spartan Demo
crat, but his hatred of the church was
about the only emotion lie held in com
mon with the radicalism in later years.
Cardinal Hobenlohe was a striking con
trast to Challemei-Lacour, though he
grew in later Hie tv bean extreme Liberal
and his Budden death is a knockdown
blow to the progressive wing of the Sacred
College. Hohenlohe would not, of course
have been its candidate for thr Papal suc
cession, but both socially and politically
he was by far its most powerful supporter
in Rome. He never dissembled his desire
to have the Vatican come u> terms with
the Quirinal. by abandoning its claim to
temporal sovereignty, and after his brother
succeeded Caprivi at Berlin this attitude
of his became so important as to e;ve the
Pupal court much anxiety. His death
leaves only six Cardinals created v. by
Pius IX. .
Tne triumph of the Liberals in the Hun
garian elections is far more sweeping than
the most sanguine bad expected. The
Clerical party, which made its fight on the
civil marriage laws, lost heavily through
out the Magyar districts, and its anti-
Semitic annex, composed of the men
called Clerical-Kossuihists, is practically
wiped out of existence . having lost forty
seats out of forty-seven. Although the
real . Kossuthists about hold their own
they are now hardly distinguishable from
other Liberals, and it may be said of the
election as a whole that it binds Hungary
and Austria more closely and satifactorily
than has been the case since 1867.
' Oddly enough a change in just the re
verse direction is going on in Lower Aus
tria, where the recent elections to the
Diet am one the fourth-class electors have
given all that class seats except one to the
Clerical and anti-Semitic combination.
The elevation of Dr. Temple to the
Archbishopric of Canterbury has literally
pleased r>o one. It is quite conceivable
that he may create a big reputation tor
himself in his new place, for Dr. Temple is
a man of unusual energy, with rude
strength of character; but these qualities
he has heretofore employed very scien
tifically to make personal enemies in all
quarters. Even more than his unpopular
individuality his advanced age appeals as
a grievance to the clergy, lor promotion to
and inside the hierarchy is tediously slow
as it is, and if only septuagenarians are to
get plums like this one at Canterbury the
clergymen feel that there is nothing left
to Jive for. No secret is made of the fact
that Dr. Temple was chosen principally
with a view to the education fight which
Lord Salisbury is intent on precipitating
again when Parliament meets. The Pre
mier is a splendid combatant, and it is
rather naively assumed that his opposi
tion to the . rate-paid system, which was
the solitary point of difference between
him and the Government last spring, will
somehow evaporate during the winter.
No violent injustice will be done him by
the assumption, because in the past til
teen year.-- he has abandoned, one by one,
practically â  every opinion he,' formerly
held.
In one respect alone does Lord Salis
bury seem likely to remain unchanged to
the end. He has been for years the most
influential advocate of total abstinence in
England and his speeches this week show
that on tbis point at least he will stand
unshaken. That he will be able to secure
any legislation in the direction of en
forced temperance, let alone of prohibi
tion, is, however, entirely unlikely.
Several members of the present Govern
ment are personally friendly to the tem
perance cause, but the Tory party as a
whole would revolt at the mere whisper
of such an idea as attacking the. brewers
and tied-house interest?.
The stories that the Queen has invited
or is going to invite all the rulers in the
world to visit London next summer and
take part in celebrating the sixtieth year
of her reign are ridiculously false. No
crowned heads will be asked to come here,
out the various dynasties are to be repre
sented, as in 1887, by princely relatives of
the sovereigns. It is rumored tnat the
Emperor of Austria is* coming to England
in the spring for a little visit, but he will
not be present at the jubilee ceremonies.
It is intended, 1 hear, to make a special
feature of the presence of a ereat number
of Indian rajahs and princes with impos
ing suits, 1897 being the twentieth anni
versary of the -assumption by the Queen
of the additional title of Empress of India.
The prevalent understanding is that St.
Paul will be the center of ceremonial this
time, as Westminister was ten years ago.
Inasmuch as honors are likely to flow
with exceptional freedom there is un
usual strife all over the country for the
office of Mayor. For this reason not so
many peers will be Mayors next year as at
present. The Lords will have to step
aside for ambitious commoners. Loud
complaints are made that the Tories in
many towns show an inclination to ignore
the time-honored rules of non-partisan ro
tation, using their majorities to set aside
Liberals who naturally would come into
office and thrusting their own party work
ers ahead instead.
Horace Darwin, son of the great Darwin,
makes bis debut in public life as Mayor of
Cambridge. Since Dillon's mock conven
tion in Dublin there has been an absolute
lull in Irish politics. This is quite the
best thing that could .Save happened.' It
is really disheartening, however, 10 find a
good man like Archbishop Walsh of To
ronto breaking in upon the beneficent
nush with such as that reported by cable.
He did not attend the convention himself,
ana it is evident that he has been misled
as to its character and spirit and
as to the attitude of the Irish
people toward it. Especially does
the Archbishop misapprehend alto
gether the position of Healy and his
friends toward the Parliamentary party.
It is wholly false to' say that they broke a
pledge or assailed their colleagues with
calumny. They merely declined to be
parties to the ruin of Ireland's cause by a
little gang of incompetent and dishonest
plotters who got hold of the party treas
ury and openly used its funds to fatten
their own heelers and to drive respectable
and intelligent men out of Irish politics.
The rule of this crew, if -it were to be per
manent, would put Ireland back to some
thing worse than even the Sadlier-Keogh
period, but there is considerable hope that
it will not last much longer. If Ireland
were left to itself relief from this swindling
clique would be even now in sight; but it
is precisely the well-meaning people at a
distance, Use the Archbishop of Toronto,
who in their ignorance take sides and
raise money for the corruption fund of
bosses in Dublin, and so perpetuate the
worst evils against which their country
men at home are struggling. -.
; Both in England and on the Continent
we are to hear a good deal that is unpleas
ant this winter about the cost of bread.
The recent advance in the price of wheat
has been seized upon by bakers every
where as warrant for an advance amount
ing to a cent on the four-pound loaf, and
they let it be understood that a further
rise is not improbable if wheat continues
to go up. Unfortunately it cannot be re
membered that when wheat began to drop
five years ago â¢ the bakers put down the
price of their : loaves in proportion, and
there is naturally a lot of bitter talk about
the rapacity of middlemen. This will not
srrow less as winter 5 comes on. Every
European country, including England,
has administrative machinery for regulat
ing the size of loaves. To this a provi
sion ; about the , price â of them could be
fixed without much difficulty, and it is not
improbable that a movement to have this
done will obtain a good deal of momen
tum before spring comes.

COMMENT IN GERMANY
newspaper* Talk Freely About Sit
'â . march* Peculiar Deplomacy.
, BERLIN, Germany, Oct. "31.â The Ham
burger Nachrichen's reply to the press
attacks made upon tbat paper,- which is
accused of making "traitorous revela
tions" in having disclosed the existence of
the .'. Russo-Germany neutrality treaty
daring the period extending from 1834 to
1890, has not in the slightest degree paci
fied Prince Bismarck's assailants, nor has
it stilled the clamor. that the Government
take decisive action to suppress the revela
tions. The Nachnchten, the personal
organ â ; of Prince Bismarck,' declares that
the Russo-German . agreement was not a
strict state secret, but was merely a part
of history, implying no disloyalty to the
Dreibund on the part of Germany, but per
muting Austria to remain neutral in the
event of a French attack upon Germany
; The Nachricnten, however, avoWs ex
planation of what is generally demanded
by the 5 public, and that ;is , to know the
reason why the , author of ; the disclosures
seized the : opportunity, at the present
juncture to make them. Â» The Swaebischo
Alerfcur suggests s "as ,a\ reason that : new
negotiations aiming at a restoration of an
entente between; Russia ;,- and Germany
having been opened, Prince Bisniuruk
THE SA^ FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER t. 1896.
thought the time opportune to assist their
progress even at the risk of divergence
from the revelations established and
maintained by the Dreibund.
The Leipsic Tageb'.att, a Bismarckian
organ, discussing the question, holds that
the disclosures have been like flashes of
liehtning, showing the road which Ger
many must follow through the darkness.
An attempt is also being made in certain
quarters to defend Prince Bismarck per
sonally against the charges of "traitorous
revelations," which have been broueht
against the ex-Chancellor, by saddling the
responsibility for the disclosures upon his
son, Count Herbert Bismarck, or Count
Holstein, an old agent of Prince Bis
marck, but this notion is not tenable.
It anybody but Prince Bismarck him
self could have been held responsible the
Government would have dealt with him
in a summary manner without delay.
There seems now to be no doubt that the
fall of Prince Bismarck was associated
with the Emperor's denunciation of the
Russo-German treaty and his Majesty's
appointment of Count Caprivi as Imperial
Chancellor followed.
Some of the Berlin newspapers are very
outspoken in their comments upon the
affair. The Boersen Courier says: "The
old malcontent statesman seeks to destroy
his own work and ruin the empirt which
he assisted to build up.''
The Cologne Gazette says: "The heart
of Germany has been deeply afflicted by
the Prince in his having accorded the con
fidence of the people which was reposed
in him to his entourage, who have recK
lessly despoiled his name and prestige to
excite and assist the enemies of his coun
try."
SEEKING TO ECONOMIZE
Proposed Exchange of Locations
Between Two California
Institutions.
Wiiittier Reform Schco' and Eldridge
Home Inmates to Bi Trans
ferred.
PETALUMA, Cal., Oct. 31.â There is at
present a proposition afoot, urged es
pecially by the board of directors of the
reform school at Whittier, and sanctioned
by Governor Budd, for the exchange of
locations between the Whittier school and
the Home for Feeble-minded Children at
Eldridge, Sonoma County. The Governor
approves of the plan on the score of econ
omy, as the directors of Whittier affirm
that they with only 160 acres are unable
to keep tne boys employed profitably,
while on the other hand the home at Eld
ridge possesses 1700 acres of arable land, and
but comparatively few of the boys have
sufficient intellect to work to any advan
tage.
Mrs. Mitchell of the Whittier institute
visited the Eldridge Home last Wednes
day, made a thorough investigation of the
buildings and surroundings and was
greatly pleased with all she saw and re
ported favorably on tlie hoped-for change.
Dr. Osborne, physician and superintend
ent of the Eldridge Home, expresses him
self greatly in favor of the project and
does not doubt its accomplishment.
To the management at Eldridge, how
ever, the proposed removal was a great
surprise, though the change will, it is con
sidered, prove of great benefit to the
weakly and invalid children now at the
Feeble-minded Institute, as the climate of
Whittier is far milder than that of
Eldridge.
Hon. John R. Price, M. A. Nourse and
other officers of the Board of Public
Works have almost completed a survey
for the establishment of an electric plant
to be run by a force of water equal to 150
horsepower and sufficient to supply light
and run all the necessary machinery cf
the institution. In this instance, at least,
the reform school establishment will be
the gainer, as at present at Whittier all
fuel has to be bought to run the machinery.
In point of numbers the inmates at
Eidridge far exceed those at Whittier, so
that, should the change be made, addi
tional buildings would be required at the
latter place before the removal could be
accomplished.
The matter will be definitely settled by
the next Legislature, and without doubt
the remoral will be made. The present
idea of the reform school management is
to place all the girls now at Whittier at
the lone school, while all the boys at lone
will be placed at Eldridge, which change
will be a decided improvement.

Burton Mound's Brave Women.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal., Oct. 3Lâ At
Burton Mound last night two women
made a plucky effort to capture a night
marauder. Early in the evening Mrs.
Menderson discovered a man crawling
through the bushes and set a dog upon
him, when he scurried down the hill.
Later Mrs. Coffin, an attendant at the
baths, saw the same man stalking about,
and as the dog continued growling she
took two shots at the intruder. As neither
blood nor corpse were to be found this
morning they evidently missed their
mark.

EDDY CLOSES THE
BUTTE CAMPAIGN
Urges His Hearers to Cast
Their Ballots for
Protection.
Confident That California Will
Give McKinley a Large
Majority.
VAGAKIEB OF THE BRYANITES.
They Created a False Issue to Catch
the Support of the Dis
contents.
CHICO. Cal., Oct. 31.â The last and
greatest Republican gun of the campaign
in Butte County was fired here this
evening, and the result was most
effective. Some weeka ago Coionel
T. V. Eddy was billed to speak in Chico.
Unfortunately his voice failed him and he
was unable to fulfill his engagement at
that time, but he came this evening and
was accorded a welcome reception. The
Town Hall was crowded to the doors and
for two hours he held this throng's close
attention.
Colonel Eddy spoke of the campaign as
at an end, and said that all that remained
to do was to keep tne Republican ranks
closed and march on to victory. He said
this was a campaign of education. He
had been to the North, East, South and
West, and here and everywhere he had
found the people awakened to tbe realiza
tion that something more than ordinary
questions was involved in this great
struggle, and that they were aware that
the financial question was but a false issue
which assaulted the faith, credit and honor
of this Nation â an issue conceived to
create a popular feeling whereby William
Jennings Bryan hoped to be elected Pres
ident of the United States.
The bone and sinew of the Democratic
party, said the speaker, could not stand a
plank which assaulted the Supreme Court,
which had stood from the infancy of this
Government to the present hour as the
bulwark and foundation of the Nation.
In that plank could be seen the image of
Governor Altgeld.
Colonel Eddy's clear argument was well
received by the Republicans and believed
by the Democrats present. He explained
explicitly the demonetization of silver,
giving the history of the silver dollar up
to the tresent date.
MODESTUS BIG MEETING.
Judge Paterson Arraign* the Democracy
for Ita Failures.
MODESTO, Cal., Oct 31.â The Repub
licans held the ust rally of the campaign
in this county here to-night, with Van R.
Paterson, ex-Associate Justice of the Su
j preme Court, as speaker. County Com
; mittee Chairman Charles T. Elliott pre
. sided and introduced Paterson, who waÂ«
| greeted with a storm of applause.
The speaker paid considerable attention
to Bryan and discussed the issues of the
campaign thoroughly. The attention of
the audience was called to the refusal of
Bryan to discuss the tariff question which,
he said, four years ago was the paramount
issue. The farmers were asked to remem
ber the promises of Mr. Bryan four years
ago that if tiiey would vote for free trade
or its nickname â tariff for revenue â their
wheat would bring $1 25 a bushel; to re
member the failure of the prophecy itself
and of the prophet to account for it.
He told them when the Populists asked
them why they desired to turn the
! finances of the country over to European
( countries to ask in return why they had
turned over the industries of the country
to European nations, and 16 to 1 if Bryan
were asked no reply would be given. The
silver question was interjected Into the
campaign because the Popocrats were
| forced to surrenderor find some expedient
I which would again fool the people, and
the free silver neresy waÂ« adopted as more
likely to catch the farmers and all who
had suffered from hard times.
No such principles as were put into the
Chicago platform, he said, could be found
in any Democratic platform preceding It.
Never did a Democratic convention before
declare that by hat of the Government 53
j cents worth of silver could be made equal
i to 100 cents in gold in the payment of pri
vate and public debts.
Tariff reform, he declared, was but a
nickname for free trade. Extncts from
messages of both Hurrison and Cleveland
and from Democratic papers were read to
I show that the country was always pros
i perous under protection and always suf
j fered under free trade. Tne speaker han-
I died without gloves the provisions of the
Chicago platform attacking the Supreme
Court, denying the right of Federal inter
ference where the mails were stopped and
property destroyed in a State and repudi
ating Government obligations. High
tribute was paid to those Democrats who,
regardless of consequences to themselves,
stood shoulder to shoulder with the Re
publicans, as they did in 1861, in defense
of the constitution and against State
rights.
SAN JOSE DEMONSTRATION
Silver Enthuiintt* Parade and Listen to
Hpteche*.
BAN JOSE, Cal., Oct. 31.â This city
was to-day the scene of a great Bryan
demonstration, under the auspices of the
Democratic and People' s party county
committees. At an early hour people be
gan to stream in from the surrounding
towns, and at the time set for the parade
tbe streets were streams of humanity. No
attempt at glittering pageantry was made,
and the parade, w ich was a homespun
affair, was very creditable, taking twenty
five minutes to pass a given point. There
was a profusion of transparencies, small
boys and farmers' wagons in line. The
potwtry towns were well represented and
gave the color of a country reunion to
the proceedings.
Rain fell at brief intervals throughout
tbe day, but that did not deter people
from going to Agricultural Park in the
afternoon, where there was speaking and
a barbecue. An ample supply of beef and
bread prevented any one from gome hun
gry. In the pavilion the gathering was
addressed by Congressman Maguire. The
day's lestivities concluded wnh a mass
meeting this evening, at which speeches
were mane by V. A. Scheller, Jackson
Hatch. E. A. Cothran, F. B. Brown,
Nicholas Bowden, F. A. Quinn, W. A.
Coulter, J. M. Moviari and K. B. Terry.
STOCKTON ORFEIN DE TRIES.

STOCKTON, Cal, Oct. 31 âThe big
Agricultural Pavilion was crowded to
night by those who eathered to hear
Marion de Vries, candidate for Congress
in the Second District, and Governor Budd
deliver addresses on the issues of the cam
paign. The Governor came from San
Franciaco by the late train and did not
reach the pavilion until 9:3o o'clock. The
Free Silver Club of this county escorted
De Vries from its headquarters to me
pavilion. To-aay badges bearing De Vries'
picture were circulated, and the people of
Stockton went bad^e crazy. Thousands
of extra ones had to bÂ» printed to supply
the demand, as De Vries is very popular
here. When he stepped onto the platform
to-night pandemonium reigned for a time,
and at intervals through his address men
threw their hats up, yelled and blew
norns.
ONTARIO'S GREATEST RALLY.
One Thousand Republican* March in a
ONTARIO. Cal., Oct 31.â Never in the
history of Ontario has there been such a
demonstration as that of this evening.
Republican enthusiasm was turned loose,
and the champions of patriotism, protec
tion and prosperity were everywhere in
evidence. Pursuant to invitations from
the Ontario Republican Club special trains
from Pomona and Riverside brought large
delegations. Pomona turned out 500
strong; Riverside sent three marching
clubs, comprising 250 uniformed men.
When the delegations had arrived a pa
rade was formed and marched through
the principal streets. There were 1000
men in line, including many on horse
bactc. Two bands and two drum corps
supplied music.
People had come in from the country for
miles around. The streets were almost
impassable. After the parade the throng
assembled at tbe bandstand, where seats
had been provided in the open air, and was
addressed by Judge J. R. Ling of Los
Angeles. Judge Ling is a pleasine speaker
and mad ; some telling points. The Po
mona Lady Quartet rendered patriotic
campaign songs during the evening.
LOS ANGELES MEETINGS.
George A. Knight and Senator White Ife-
liver Speeches.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 31.â The last
Saturday night of the National campaign*
of 1896 witnessed two great meetings in
this city. Hon. George A. Knight of San
Francisco held forth for two hours in a
speech of great power at Hazard's Pavil
ion, which was crowded by an audience
which has had no equal in numbers since
"Tom Reed day" in Los Angeles. Hun
dreds were unable to find seats and hun
dreds were turned away, not being able to
find even standing room. The speaker's
special point was the condition of work
ingmen in this country under the low tar
iff policy of the Democratic party and
under a Democratic administration, aided
and abetted by a Democratic .douse and
Senate.
"Behold," said Mr. Knight, "the benefi
cent fruits of the Democracy's fiscal pol
icy and a Democratic administration. Do
you want any more?"
"No I no!" came from all parts of the
great pavilion.
Senator White spoke to the Popocrats at
the free-silver wigwam. The audience
was a big one." The Senator demoted most
of his time to "roasting" the element of
his party which could not support the
Chicago platform. ;

PORTLAND'S GREAT PARADE
Eight Thousand Republicans March and
Cheer for MeKinleyi
PORTLAND, Or., Oct. 31.-Neyer in the
history of Portland or the State has there
been a political demonstration such as
was seen here to-night. Fully 8000 people
paraded the streets for three hours. Re
publican clubs from several surrounding
cities took part In the display, which ex
ceeded in elaborateness anything ever at
tempted before. Every tra le, industry
and business bouse was represented.
Tnere were thousands oi visitors in the
city to-day, and Portland was ablaze with
McKinley enthusiasm. The streets were
thronged all afternoon and evening, de-
SDite inclement weather. Flag day was
observed in surpassing style. In the pa
rade 1000 railroad employes marched with
flambeaux, whistles and banners, pre
ceded by a locomotive mounted on trucks
and drawn by sixteen horses.
Governor Lord and prominent men re
viewed the parade and a monster meet
ing was then held at the exposition build
ing. A party of Eastern tourists here
declared they had seen nothing equaling
the excitement and display since 1867.
SACRAMENTO'S ENTHUSIASM
Hoist c rout Ovation to Congressman

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 3Lâ A sea of
upturned laces, a mass of flags and bunt
ing, an audience of thousands, brimful of
the wildest enthusiasm, greeted Congress
man Grove L. Johnson to-night In the
M. tropoutan Theater, and were rewarded
I with one of the grandest flights of oratory
ever heard in this city. Johnson spoke to
the people on behalf of the head of the
National ticket. He forgot self and sur
roundings, his voice echoing through the
vast building as it had in the halls of Con
gress when pleading for some measure
beneficial to the land of the Golden West
| the laud of his first love. His speech
made more Republicans, strenethened
more weaklings and will add to the ma
jority for McKinley and protection in
this city during the present campaign
Plaeerville'a Demonstration.
PLACERVILLE, Cal., Oct. 31 âThe
final Republican rally i n Placerville to
night was the most enthusiastic political
gathering of the campaign. Mrs. Riddell
of San Diego delivered an excellent ad
dress in behalf of the sixth amendment
Hon. Charles A. Swisler of Placerville
candidate for Senator, was one of the
speakers and was given a rousing recep
tion. Hon. John M. Fuiweiler of Auburn
spr.ke on the financial issue with logical

present campaign has there been such en
thusiasm in Placerville as was awakened
to-night.
In the Pa jar o Valley.
WATSONVILLE, Cal., Oct 3L-The
last grand Republican rally of the cam
paign was held here this evening. There
was a torchlight street parade, in which
tne McKinley Cadets of Santa Cruz par
ticipated and cave a fancy drill. Hon. F.
X. Schoonrnaker of New Jersey was the
orator of tbe evening and handled the
silver question from a Republican stand
point in a masterly manner. The opera
house was crowded to the doors, and a
great number of people were unable to
gain admittance. The Pajaro Vail y will
roll up a good majority next Tuesday for
McKinley and protection.
Silver's bight in Santa Rosa.
SANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 3Lâ The clos

Populists of this place was held in the
Athenaeum to-night. Hon. Jefferson G.
Chandler of Washington, D. C, was the
principal speaker and varied the usual
programme by an excursion into the tariff
domain. His sptecu was one of the best
of the campaign and was listened to by
about 2000 people. R. D. Gale acted as
chairman and about twenty of the leading
Silver Democrats occupied seats on the
platform. Monday night the Republicans
will hold their final meeting, at which
Hon. John A. Barham and the local can
didates will appear.
Cloverdaie Campaign Ended.
CLOVERDALE, Cal., Oct. 31.â The Re
publicans closed their campaign here last
night with a grand rally. Large bonfires
turned night into day and the Cloverdaie
brass band, with inspiring strains, in
creased the enthusiasm of the multitude
to a high Ditch. The speakers were L V
Hitchcock of San Francibco, W. S. Sialy
candidate for the Assembly, and A G*
Burnett and J. K. Dougherty, candidates
for County Judges. It id candidly ad-
J mitted by the enemy that the Republican

GILROY, Cal., Oct. 31.â Hon. E. S.
Lippitt of Petaluma gave a very practical
and plain argument for sound money
to-night at Music Hall before an enthu
siastic audience. He presented the silver
question clearly to his hearers and urged
them to save the country from a financial
panic by voting for McKinley. Mr. Lippitt
is a sound money Democrat and has been
in the Democratic ranks for years. K. D.
Van Schaick was chairman of the meet
ing.
Closing Holly at Colusa.
COLUSA, Cal., Oct. 31.â The Republi

chairman of the Republican County Cen
tral Committee, called the meeting to
order and introduced as the speaker of the
evening Hon. T. B. Hutchinson of Napa.
Mr. Hutchinson held the close attention
of his audience for nearly two hours. He
made many good points.
Cator>* Frost at Sacramento.
BACRAMENTO, Cal.. Oct. 31.â Thomas
V. Cator's crowd at Turn Hall to-night
could not have exceeded 300 persons, and
was in strong contrast to the thousands
who crowded the Metropolitan to listen
to the addresses of the Republican candi
dates. If the two audiences are to be
taken as a criterion, Sacramento County
will give an overwhelming majority for
McKinley.
Snnta Hot a 'a Crysanthetnum Fete.
BANTA ROSA, Cal., Oct. 31.â The
chrysanthemum fete held here Thursday,
Friday and to-day has been successful in

REVIEWED BY MR. HOBART.
One Hundred Thousand Republican
Voters Carry Flags in the Mag
nificent Precession.
NEW YORK, S. V., Oct. 3Lâ What un
doubtedly goes on record as the greatest
political parade in the history of this
countiy was finisheJ at 6:30 ;o-night, at
which bour the last of the paraders in the
preat demonstration in honor of McKin
ley ana Hobirt passed tne reviewing
stand at Madison square. One hundred
t ousand men marched in line.
Vice-Presidential Candidate Hobart,
Governor Morton, members of theÃepub
> lioan National Committee and others
A j ( oked upon the scene from the reviewing
stand all day, and everybody, including
nearly 500,000 onlookers, were unanimous
in declaring that such a spectacle as was
presented in to-day's parade had o par
allel in American history.
It was 10:55 a. m. when the head of the
parade reached me revie 'ing stand, and
looking down F.fth avenue in the di
rection from wnich the paraders came, the
line of vision showed only a vast sea of
undulating American flans. As the divi
sions swept closer to tl>e stand the cries
of the men and the enlivening tunes of
the bands aroused the enthusiasm of
Ihose gathered in the big square.
General Horace Porter remarked at the
conclusion that the work was worthy of
trained soldiers. It was the- result, he de
clared, simply of intelligence. Tne men
passed thereviewine stand at a rapid gait,
ana had the marching order of a regular
military company been maintained it
wouid have required twice the length of
time for the parade to have passed a given
JOSEPH G. BASTON, the Early Pioneer and Prominent Mason.
point. It is calculated that on an average
tne paraders passed the reviewing stand
Et the rÃtb of 13,000 an hour. General
Porter had estimated that it would jiroba
bly be 12,000. At thi3 rate the number of
men in line was 100,000.
A remarkable tiling about the parade
was the display of colors. The red, white
and blue floated above everything, but
nearly every man in line wore on his coat
1 lapel a big yellow cnrysanthemum. Many
added to this other colors, which lent
great variety to the scene. Yellow and
colored plumes were also numerous in the
line and whole divisions wore golden
colored silk hats and a.pines.
Perhaps the most striking feature of the
. parade was thirty-seven dirt-begrimed,
i tallow looking coal miners. They beaded
I ihe coal division. Surrounding them were
Kfhe best dressed men of New York. The
\ontrast wai marked. The miners looked
as if they had just come up from the bow
els of the earth after a hard day's work.
They wore the costume peculiar to those
workers and carried in their han-is weil
used Dicks, while from their hats the regu
lation mine lamps gave out a smoky
light.
Next in interest were the Columbia Col
lege men. They were picturesquely
dressed and ended with the freshman
class of 1900, gorgeously arrayed in
Napoleon hats. The large number in the
delegation of lawyers attracted much
notice. The great jurists of the city
marched si c by side with members of
the bar. There were gray- haired meu,
aoroe almost at the tottering stage of
feebleness, and witn them youngsters who
have yet to gather first briefs.
Great also was the turnout of the insur
ance men, headed by John A. McCall and
H. B. Hyde. . It is said that about every
man of importance in this city was in line.
The bankers and broker* were a demon
strative crowd, with James B. Smith, ex
commodore of the New York Yacht Club,
at their heed.
Considering the great mass of people
participating as paraders and onlookers
tne accidents were few. One man fell
irom a stand and had his skull fractured.
Another fell fr m bis horse and was
badly injured. A musician dropped in
the ranks from overheat, and a few minor
Accidents werÂ»- reported.
I It was a very warm day, and much ap
prehension was consequently felt by the
xV>lice. The city was tilled with strangers.
arM though it was over at 6:30 the
paraders filled the streets all evening,
and it has been many a day since New
York ban seen such a e.-iy night.

SACRAMENTO. C al, Oct. 31.â A man
about buysars old was struck by a train
onatre-tlo near Webtters Siding, a fÂ».-w
miles west of this city, this afternoon,
and instantly killed. He was apparently
deaf, as he made no tffort whatever to
esc.<pe from the danger. On his person
was a paper on which was written "F. T.
S:ark," and another bearing the words
"Swans, between Market and Mission on
Fourth street." The man was about 5
feet 9 inches in height and had evidently
6een better days, as his person aud cloth

CA .EEB OF J, G, BASTON.
The Funeral Will Occur To-
Day From the Masonic
Temple.
He Came to Calitcrnia as a Mere
Youth â Leaves a Widow and
Two Daughters.
The funer.il of the late Joseph G. Baston
will take place at 2 o'clock this afternoon
from King Solomon's Hall of the Masonic
Temp'e. The teniain3 will be interred in
the Masonic Cemetery.
Mr. Baston was engaged in different en
terprises after his arrival here forty-four
years ago. He was for a number of years
with the firm of Waterhouse &, Lester,
though not recently, and he tried his
hand at many things, as did many other
California pioneers. Through a' l his ex
periences he was held in high repute.
He was born in Boston, Mass., and came
here when but a youth of 16 years. He
has left a family consisting of a widow
and two daughters, one of whom is mar
ried. The family, so it is stated, is fairly
well provided for.
Mr. Baston belonged to the Mission
Lodge, California Chapter and Golden
Gate Commandery of Masons. He was
also for a number of years a member of
the Masonic Quartet.
The pentleman bad so many friends and
was generally bo well known that it is
probable there will be a large attendance
at the funeral to-day.

SENT TO PRISON FOR THEFT.
Learns From a Portland Man That
His Doub c Lon; Ago Con

PORTLAND, Ok., Oct. 3Lâ William P.
Severance, a late arrival, with his family,
from Sacramento, Cal., had a strange
caller at his residence a few evenings ago
in tne person of a beggar. This man was
seemingly about 35 years old. with weath
er-beaten face, such as distinguishes sail
ors after a long and tempestuous
voyage. There was something in the out
cast's countenance appearing strangely fa
miliar to Mr. Severance, and in order to
study the beggar's face more leisurely the
stranger was asked into the kitchen to
partake of some cold victuals.
"Where nave I seen you before?" asked
Mr. Severance, after contemplating the
ravenously hungry fellow a few minutes.
"Nowhere, I guess," replied the beggar.
"I'm a sailor and 1 just came in from
China. I left my steamer at 'acorns a
few days ago and came here, where 1 fool
ishly spent ail my money,"
"Do you remerab r ever seeing my face
before?" queried the nest.
"Can't say I do, for this is my first re
turn to the United States since 1 left my
home in St. Louis, Mo., (en years ago."
"You are Ernest Cragie, are you not?"
"I am; but who are you?" queried the
bepgar with much surprise.
Mr. Severance knew the man before
him when he was a promising boy, and
knew bis family, too, in St. Louis. He
says this man was the victim of the con
scienceless treachery of a cousin, resem
bling him bo closely that it was difficult
for their most intimate mends to diaiin*
guisn one from the other. One night in
1831 Ernest's mother in St. Louis was
chlorotormed and $7000 worth of dia
monds stolen from her bedchamber. The
jewels were hypothecated early the fol
lowing morning to an Olive-street pawn
broker. The police discovered the stolen
gems a few days afterward, and without
entering into details the broker identified
Mrs. Cragie's son as the young man having
received $3000 on the diamonds from him.
There could be no doubt or that, because
Ernest's double was at Cheltenham, a
place about thirty miies distance from St.
Louis, that night.
Ernest was branded as a thief, and, de
spite the efforts of his famil , to spare him
from punishment, was consigned to the
penitentiary at Jefferson City for five
years. He served his time, and without
ever visiting his relatives be went to Cali
fornia, and from there to China, where
for the past decade he has been leading a
roistering career on steamers plying in
Oriental waters. In fact his adventures,
as he told them to his Portland benefactor,
wou:d fill a volume.
"Three years ago," said Mr. Severance,
"Ernest's cousin died in San Francisco,
and on his deathbed he confessed to a
priest that he was the man who had stolen
bis aunt's jewels fifteen years ago. On the
day of the robbery he announced to his
friends that he was going to Cheltenham,
he having had in his mind the commission
of this robbery for several weeks. Alter
gaining possession of the diamonds and
pawning them, he really did go to Chel
tenham, remaining there for several days,
and permitted his cousin to become a
convict for his ownvillany."
Mr. Severance imparted this informa
tion to Cragie, and the latter was induced
to go home and viÂ«it bis old mother.
An Old Landmark In Ashes.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin," for more than forty
years a iamous house out on the San Bruno
road, was burned Friday morning. In
early days the place whs known as the "Star
and Garier," and was much patronized by per
sons traveling between this City and San Jose
and other points south. Later it passed into
the hands of a negro and was then given tne
name of "TJncie Tom's Cabin." It hÂ«Bchanged
hands many times since then, but the name
has always cluuir to it. Of late years it has
been a popular Sunday resort for San Fran
cisco people, an 1 altogether was probably the
best known rrad house in the State. Thomas
X ink, the present lessee of the place, with his
wife ana two children, were ssieepin the house
when lhe tire broke ont. They barely escaped
with thtir lives. The fire is believed to have
been caused by a defec:ive flue in the kitchen

"Put him out," in which the voices of
women depositors joined. He tried to
speak from the box but coul . not make i
himself heard. lie then stepped on the
stage and the storm against him raged
more violently thun before. Depositors ,
shouted and shook their lists. Ho could
not be heard three feot away, so he retired
to the box again.
The storm did not cease, but rained in '
intensity. Finally he took his bat and
with his two triends, Uuggett and hichoff,
went out, the deiositors yelling "I'm him
out," and cheering with delight and hold
ing up their hats on canes when he was
gone.
Speeches were made by T. H. McCarthy,
K. F. Kendall, Thomas S. Wllliunis Jr., j
George I!, Ooiiant and Benjamin Lucy, ;
members of lho depositors" committee, all j
of whom denounced Htibbard strongly. A I
particularly liery speech was made by H. 1
D. I'ike, formerly secretary of the com
mittee. Judge llebburd enteicd wmle
Mr. Pike whs denouncing him. Pike i
called him hard names
Judge llrbb.ird reached the box at that
moment and one of his friends called out
"Call him that to his face, you." <
Pike moved toward the box and was i
apparently about to denounce Judge
llttubard to his face, but the contusion !
pro vett led.
Later in the evening Colonel S. O. Greg- |
ory, whom Judge Hebbard's friends ear- ;
lier hnd tried to nave for chairman, spoke !
under d IHcultiei in lavor of Judge Heb
bard. Alter a few sentences he â lfored to !
read a communication wmch Judge Heb- j
bard bad written, but the depositors I
would not listen to it and voted not to re- !
ceive it.
The lust speaker was Mr. Foster, a de- !
positor, who said that he was surprised
mat Judge Hebburd should have come to
the meeting. li was unbecoming his
diunity. He was surprised also that lleb- \
bard's friends should have tried to break
up the meeting. . Chris Buckley used to j
do that sort of thing fifteen years ago, but '
has learned better... *
Three reports were submitted. The
angry depot tors and tho friends of Judge
He bbard en the theater talking loud and
shaking their iUts.
Judca Uebbard's signed statement,
which Colonel Gregory tried to read but
failed to read, opened with a statement
that an injustice had been done through
the medium of the circular issued by Hie
depositors' committee. The statement
was long. -It set forth that he appointed
Jot.n F. Sheehan receiver at the request of
Attoruey-Genural Hart and Sheehau ap
pointed Jamas Alva Watt as attorney.
Judge Hebbard . stated concerning this
that he told Sheehan that he. had doubt
whether a receiver could appointed in an
action brought by the Attorney-General
ana that he might never become, entitled
to any compensation and Sheehan ac
cepted the appointment with that under
â¢taudiug. The appointment of Sheehan
in the equity action, following the deci
sion of the Supreme Court on July 11. 1594,
w.is made in compliance with the sugges
tion of the Supreme Court and alter a per
sonal interview with the Chief Justice in
Hie presence of Justices Van Float and
Garoutte.
Judge Hebbard also stated that he per
mitted the attorneys for the depositors to
come into court to endeavor to organize a
new b srd of directors and to give the
depo&itor* representatives therein. He
succeeded in petting Thomas S. Williams
Jr. and two of his associates tiseisd di
rectors.to represent the depositors. Judge
Hebbard a. so set forth that he ntv. r

HOMES FOR THE SICK.
The California Woman's ' Iloapltal' and
the King's Daughters'. Home
for Incurable*.
The California Woman's Hospital is one
of the largest and finest hospital buildings
in the State, devoted exclusively to the
ireatment of women, and no doubt has
one of the finest operatitiL'-roonib in the
country. This hospital offers the com
forts of a home as well as the best of
surjical and medicul treatment. The
Woman's Hospital exins as a purely
medical charity and gives relief to tbe
following three classes of people: To those
who are destitute and unable to pay any
tuiagj to those who i> meant are too
limited to enable them to pay for private
medical attendance at home, and- to those
who are able to pay for medical attend
ance and all .hospital charges and preter
to enter this homelike place and avail
then, selves of the benefits of its appli
ances.
A feature of the institution is the de
partment reserved solely for obstetrical
cases, where women are accommodated
and afforded all the advantages of skillful
nursing and constant mea<cal supervi
sion.
The reception-rooms, the consulting
rooms, the wards and the private rooms
are eacli in themselves models of perfec
tion. The drugroora is under the care of
an experienced pharmacist, while the cui
sine offers all the luxuries of the season.
Upon application to the matron a neat
prospectus of the hospital will be for
warded.
Home for Incurnbles.
The King's Daughters' Home for In
curables, at 217 Francisco street, is an in
stitution that has for its object a cause
more worthy, perhaps, than any other in
stitution in the State.
The King's Daughters is an incorporated
society under the directorship of the fol
lowing well-known ladies: Mrs. J. G.
Clark, pro-ident; Mrs. K. M. Cafea, vice
president; Mrs. Kichnrd Brown, record
ing secretary, and Mr>. Fred Diserens,
matron. The society is for the purpose of
giving a home to those unfortunate incur
ables who have been removed from the
hospitals and who have, no friends. The
home in its pre-ent state, however, is in
ndequnte and a bu.lding fund has been
started 'or ii new li>mie.
To bo pronounced incurable is of itself
enough to drive one to despair, but to
huvo nowhere to go, no friends nor
home. is bitterly hard to bear, and to
further the chum- of the King's Daughters'
Home no more worthy donation ,or be
quest could be made. A neat prospectus
01 the home will be fowarded on applica
tion.
AN UNEQUAL SCORE.
The T. â >!. C. A. and the Ffiraltai
Ciiutiter-Klck at Sixteenth Street. '
The Y. M. C. A. and the Peralta Univer
sity Academy played a gnmo of football
yesterday at the Sixteenth and Folsom
street grounds. The young men were
pretty evenly matched in weight, the
average being about 130 pounds.
From me start it waÂ» aupurent that the
Y. M. C. A. was the better eleven; it may
be attributed to this partly and to th
softness of the earth that the game was
free from any serious mishap.

EXTRACTING THE
OCEAN'S FORCE
An El Dorado Mining En
gineer's New Wave
Motor.
The Power Comes Ashore From
a F.oat Moored Among
the Breakers
WORKS UNDER ALL CONDITIONS
A System of Pawl and Ratchet Wheels
That Rolls tbe Shaft in
One Direction.
Down at the foot of Powell street, on the
bay beach, is the model of a wave motor
that seems to work on a principle that
abstracts power from the eternal pulsa
tion of the sea without being dependent
Dwyer's New Wave Motor.
upon vagaries of that motion. It is simple
In conception, yet unerring in execution,
and its advantage over other motors, as
claimed by the investor, is that the
whole machinery is on the solid land and
not out on the surface of tbe water, at tbe
mercy of wind and tide, breaker and
calm.
A float or large buoy is securely anchored
in tbe water, and on it is stepped a strong
pole or ma-u lone enough that its top will
describe considerable of an arc as the
structure i>itch<>> on the inrolling waves.
Of course the float will move forward and
hack to it 9 anchor, but this motion is an
sssistaAL
From the top of the mast a wire rcn-e
runs ashore to the motor proper. Neai
thta machine it is attached to a chain
which goes over a cogged drum, drawn
around an ordinary pulley stationed
below, and up over another drum
down to a heavy weight. Within these
drums are pawl and ratchet wheels so ar
ranged in relation to each other that
their revolutions in opposite directions
roll the flywheel constantly in one direc
tion.
The pull of the float not only sets the
flywheel in motion, but raises the weight,
and the slacking of the wire rope permits
it to sink again without checking the ever
tarninc flywheel. The recurring tug on
the wire ro, c caused by the pitching float
immediately begins to lift the weight, and
this is the philosophy of the wave-gen
dered poxer.
At the place where J. M. Dwyer, the in
ventor, has tneJ his motor there are
hardly any waves, and even under those
conditions he found that the machine
worke.l successfully. He intends to m ye
out to Baker's Beach, where the breakers
are heavier and more regular. Mr. Dwyer
is a mining engineer from El Dorado, and
has spent considerable time in the study
of a new practical plan (or utilizing the
power of the sea. His invention is
patented, an<i a company of mining men
are interested in the new motor.
"LABOR'S TEMP TATIONS."
The Dram* Presented for the Benefit of
the Building Trudes' Council
It wss unfortunate that the Han Fran
cisco BuildinÃ Trades' Council should
have self cted last evening as the occasion
upon which to hold its benefit in the Cali
fornia Theater. The affair was by no
means a failure, but it would have been
more of a success if it had not been for the
political meetings that were held all over
the City. While the attendance in the
theater was fair there were seats for many
more. However, those who attended were
well pleased with the first presentation of
"Labor's Temptations" in this City.
A large number of tickets were sold, the
holders of which did not make use of the
same.
"Labor's Temptations" is a drama In
which are depicted all of the troubles and
hardships that attend a lnrge strike. It
was wrll staged and the actors performed
their parts with feeling and spirit.
As may be supposed, tbe piece was made
up of factory hands citizens, strikers,
mill owners, labor reformers and a num
ber of allegorical personages representing
good anil evil.
Several hundred dollars will be cleared
for tbe benefit of the Building Trades
Council.
FIVE FAVORITES WON
Ostler Joe at 12 to 1 Was the
. Only Winning Outsider
at Ing'eside.
Cacdelaria, Nebuchadnezzar, Hami-
Scott, Col. W'jightm .n and Red
Pike Took Pursvs
The mighty turnout of McKinley and
gold paraders Kept many racegoers away
from Ingleside yesterday. Nothing short
of death, though, keeps the regulars away,
and they were there in full force, aug
mented by seveial hundred woo do not
mix in politic-'. About the only occur
rence of note was the unloading on the
market of the Montana horse. Ostler Joe,
who was specially prenared, and took the
opening race of the day at the very re
munerative odds of 12 to 1. He was
backed down several points, and won by
a nose from Alvarado. Favorites cap
tured the other five races, and the crowd
left for home with wealth. The weather
was plras.-ini and the track good.
Jockey Eddy Jones kept up his winning
clip by "winning two out of his three
mounts.
Pnt D inne's Btrathrol made such a good
showing again>t St. Lee on the opening
day of the meeting that be was installed
an even money choice for the first event
on the card, a seven-furlong run decided
under selling conditions. He was bumped
at the start and never cut much figure in
the running. Ostl'T Joe came through
the stretch liKe a racehorse and, overhaul
ing Salisbury II and Alvarado, beat the
.'atter out a neck. Alvarado was disquali
fied for fouling and placed last, thus
moving both Salisbury II and Strathrol
up a peg.
The five and a half furlong scramble for
two-year-olds was a mere exercise gallop
for the 3 to 10 favorite, Candelaria. who
won galloping from Dunboy. Mima
Owen, a 60 to 1 shot, was third.
The mile handicap was one of tbe best
betting affairs of tne day. The game little
Nebuchadnezzar, with 102 pounds ud,
opened a 6 to 5 choice, but so much coin
poured into tue ring on Kamsin, cutting
iiis price from 3 and 4 to 2 to 1, that the
Brntus horse receded to '2% to 1. Finally
the books laid 2 to 1 ana take your pick
against either. Thelma was also heaviiv
supported at 2}^ to 1. Lincoln II and
Marcel were accorded some little support.
The race needs little description. Jones
took Nebuchadnezzar out in front, and
although Kamsin was hard ridden, ap
peared outclassed at the weights and suc
cumoed easily by a couple of lengths in
1:44 12.1 2 . L ncoln II wa-t a fair third.
\V;.i) Willie Martin up on Mamie Scott
the mare ran a greatly improved race over
her run of the day preceding when ridden
by Siocum. She rated along out in front
in the -ix-furlong spin that followed, with
Artemus and Peril, and drawing away the
la-t furlong won easily from the first
named horse, a 50 to 1 shot.
The mi c and a quarter hurd'e affair
was another cakewalK for Colonel Weish;
man, who won in a big canter fr> m Hunts
man, starting alto 2 favorite. Baby B.il
was third.
The final race of the day, at five and a
half furlong?, went to the 7 to 5 favorite,
who made most of the running, and in a
hard drive lasted long enough to beat
Harry O, a 25 to 1 chance, a bead.
No'os.
Tommy Butler was indefinitely sus
pended by tbe judges for his ride on the
n;ly. Sally Sensible.
The judges substituted Willie Maitin in
place of Tommy Butler ou the back of
Mamie Scott.
E.even bookmakers cut in yesterday.
Joan Givens, the trainer for Naglee
Burke, stated to the judges that Starter
Havev was entirely blameless for lsaving
Tuelma at the post. The trainer handled
the mare at the barrier and said that she
started to break, but wheeled as the web
bing shot upward in the air.

STANFORD BEATEN

Clubmen Break Their Long-
Existing Football
"Hoodoo."
A One-Sided Match in Which
Varsity Players Show
Poor Form.
FOUE TO NOTHING THE SCORE.
Comm -nts of Captains on Features of
the Gameâ Players Favor
McKinley.
Olympic nas won a football match, tbe
first victory in several seasons. Stanford,
unaccustomed to defeat, and until yester
day unscored against this year, has been
beaten by a score of 4 to 0.
It *as a surprise all round, but as *n
exhibition of football it was at no time
brilliant, the Stanford team apparently
standing up only to be persistently bat
tered by tho continued line-bucKing of
Olympic.
Ihere were several disagreeable features
connected with yesterday's match at
Central Park. Again the management
permitted the sidelines to be crowded
with spectators who had no business there,
and who interfered not only with the view
of those in the grand stands, but in the
case of a iarge number of Olympic parti
sans, actually crowded near to and
cuached and urged on the Olympic
1 "layers.
A particularly unsportsmanlike, repre
hensible and unusual occurrence was the
continued hissing of a number of specta
tors whenever the college men attempted
to encourage their team with the Stan
lord yell.
Just ow the game went may be seen in
the accompanying chart of the progress of
the ball.
A straw ballot taken for Thx Call after
the game showed that of the nventy-ei-nt
m n that played in the match twenty
three favor McKnley, four favor Bryan
and one was undecided.
Frank Buuerwor h, Berkeley's coach,
who umpired tlie game, in speaking of
the general work of the two teams, said
that the kicking was a marked feature on
both sideÃ and that in most cases it was
very beneficial. In his opinion the Olym
pics had much the betier line ana were
more steady in their team work. He
t nought that both aides needed to look to
the wurk of their backs, especially with
regard to tbe matter of fumb.in^ and
taking advantage < f openings in the line.
FoWowing are ali the men that took part
in the game, arranged as they faced their
opponents. The stripped weight of each
player is given, showing wnat he opposed
in the avoirdupois of his vis-a-v.s:

Captain Flckert'a View*.
The Stanford men were, perhaps, too confi
dent. Our team wort was poor. Every man
played by himself. There was not a sign of
interference on our part.
After the game personally I never felt so i
mean in my life. During the game I played '
like a man in a trance and did not sweat a'
drop. Ido not know what may have been the j
matter with the other fellows, but our whole
team seemed to play like men that had been
stuuned. ,
There was no good individual playing on our
side. The men were all pÂ»etty poor individ
ually and showed it all the more because there
was no team work.
Olympic had every man on the play and put i
up a much harder and more aggressive game '
than last time. I think, tnough, that King- I
ton, the Olympic center, is one of the foulest I
players I have tver seen and ought not to play
football. Weldon. the Olympic fullback, played
a good gtme and ran and punted well, and
Sheeny, the O.jmDic guard, who was my im
mediate opponent, played an extra good game
and proved himself a ground-gainer.
In regard to the claim of some for Olympic
that Silckney should have been allowed a sec
oad touchdown I would explain that Stickney
struct our line right over the goal line He
was severely jarred by the impact with several
men, and Cotton instantly secured the ball as
Stickney helplessly relaxed before, calling
"down" or before the umpire had called down.

Chas. Fickeet, Captain Stanford Varsity.
Captain Smith's Opinion.
The work ot the Olymiics was a great sur
prise to me. It is needless to cay that this
surprise was a most happy one. We did not
have the least idea that we would win the
game when we went on the field. The "hoo
doo" that has been hnngini; over the Olympic
football men (or several years prst has most
certainly been removed. \Ve really expected
to be beaien as badiy as the Reliance were by
the Palo Alto men, 11 not worse. We thought
that we might score, bin we little dreamed of
Ereventing S'anford from scoring. Our line
eld very well, indeed.
The men all played hard and played well.
Each player was determined to do his best,
realizing as he aid tha he had odds to work
against and an uphill fight to niak.-. All of
our backs dul go.d work, especially Stlckuey.
Tommy rode, at quarter, used his head better
than I have Â» ver seen him beiore, and I be
lieve that to-day he is the best quarter-back
on the coast.
Sheeny and Hobbs made their reputat.onsas
guards. :-n ehy Is an old player, but has
never before shone so brilliantly, while Hobbs
is a new man, with his football career before
him.
I really believe that we ought to have had
the try at goal, because I feel certain that the
ball did not touch the uround when Weldon
was holding it waiting for Stickney to kick.
However, we consider ourselves very fortunate
in making the score that we did and at the
game time preventing the college men lrom
scoring. Pete Smith.

CURIOUS ESCAPE OF A CALF
Bg Fire at the Ow n Ranch duscd
by Sulphur Igniting a Currant
Chest Containing B^es.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call.)
90S Broadway, Oct. 31. \
The most costly case of extermination of
bees has just occurred at the Owen ranch,
near Mount Eden. It probably cost not
less than $3000 to drive out a drove of
honey-makers from a barn.
Fora number ol winters Mr. Owen has
tried to rid his barns of the bees, and
smoking them out proved to be only a
temporary relief. The last time that
smoking was tried the bees turned on the
men and chased them aimost to Hay
wards.
A couple of days aeo a final attempt was
made to get nd of the bees by the use of
suiphur. The result was successful, and
there is not a single bee or larva left in
the barn, but neither is there any barn or
lots of other things that were in it a week
ago.
The bees had taken up cozy quarters in
a currant chest and the chest was quite
close to one of the barns on the rauch.
The sulphur was kept burning ah the
afternoon, and about dark all the fire was
supposed to have been extinguished. The
family and farmhands retired, and felt
quite certain that they would be no longer
troubled with bees.
It was nearly midnight when a party of
young men consisting of Frank Zim
bresky, Manuel Rodgers, Joe Goodell,
Fred Wrede and Joseph Enos discovered
a bright light, and at once hurried toward
it. They found a large fire well uuder
way, and at once gave the alarm, and
iben started *n to save the large barn and
adjoining building.
Mr. Owen and his brother soon re
sponded, and when they reached the fire
they found two large sheds destroyed.
Nothing could save them, bo all their
efforts were directed to saving the adjoin
ing buildings, and in this they Tvere en
tirely successful. In addition to the two
large sbeds 7000 fruit boxes, 140 currant
chests, all the plows, harrows, a fanning
mill, cultivators and other implements
were destroyed.
The larze barn completely hid the fire
from the view of the family residence, and
had not the boys discovered it when tbey
did there is no doubt but that it would
have burned every building close by, in
cluding the residence. It is supposed
that Hie sulphur that was placed inside
the currant chest leaked through and set
fire to the wood. At one time it looked as
tnough everything would go, as sheds and
fences were on fire, but the Mount Eden
volunteers and others worked hard and
did good service.
One of the most peculiar incidents of
the fire was the narrow escape of a calf
that was in a pen near the sheds. When
the fire was subdued no trace ol the
animal could be found, and it was thought
that the poor beast had perished. Next
morning a farmer found a badly singed
caif on the road arid found that it bore the
Owens mark. The animal roust have per
formed some notable acrobatic work to
get out of its pen.
OUT OF POLITICS.
The Aiameda Liquor-Dealers Will Not
Indorse a Ticket of Tlieir Own.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 31.â Theodore
Gier, president of the Aiameda County
Liquor- dealers' Association, was inter
viewed to-night by a Call correspondent.
He said; "We cailed a meeting about six
weeks ago and discussed the matter of
indorsing a ticket. Afterward I talked
with the State association's representative
and finally we decided that as an organi
zation we would keep out of the figh t.
"All of the candidates are fair-minded
business men whom we cau depend upon
to give us our rignts, and that isaJl we
want. Only one or" two exceptions can be
noted, and it is not worth our while to
light those and make onemies of tneir
friends. 2io, you may cay for me that as
an organization the Aiameda County
Liquor-dealers' Association will not hold
a meeting to indoise a ticket nor send out
any recommendation-. We are not m the
field of politics except as individuals."
WIDOW AGAINST WIDOW
Funds of a Church Conference
Attached for a Beneficiary's
Rent.
Judgment Given Against the Minis
ter's W.dow and Her Pension
Held Out to Pay It.
Oakland Office Pas Francisco Call,>
9jÃ Broadway, Oct. 3L t
A return was made to the Sheriff to-day
upon a very unusual attachment. Never
before has the Sheriff been called upon to
attach the finances of a religious State
gathering for the rent of one of its delin
quent adherents.
Mtb. E. C. Morrow, a widow of Santa
Rosa, owns a little cottage, which she
rented to the widow of a late minister of
the Methodist Episcopal Church South.
Being a widow, she is in receipt of a pen
sion from the annual conference. For un
known reasons the widow, Mrs. Da vies,
allowed her arrears of rent to climb up
to $60.
Mra. Morrow learned that the annual
conference holds the funds, and that the
pensions are apportioned at the sessions.
The sessions were recently held in this
city, and while in deliberation the chair
man of the finance committee, Rev. W.
H. McKnight. was served with an attach
ment upon l4 all moneys or goods under
I the control or in the po-session of the
I finance committee of the Pacilic confer-
L dice of 18S6 of the Methodist EDiÂ»copal
Souib."
Tne conference at once took the view
that its beneficiaries should certainly pay
their bills. After a few inquiries ii was
decided to hold out the money from the
widow's annual pension and satisfy the
judgment. Chairman McKnight notified
the Sheriff to-day that the money waa in
his hands waiting to be turned over to the
proper authority.
CONDEMNS OGLESBY
A Colored Orator Who is Destitute of

OAKLAND. Cal., Oct. 30â Editor Callâ Dkae
Pie: This morning a. colored man named
Oglesby took his stand in front of the Army
and Xavy Rtpublic.m League and commenced
a harangue against the principles for which
the veterans '.ought. Ordinary aecency would
have led any gentleman to choose t-ome other
place. We wish to condemn this Ogles>by as
unworthy of any consideration at all. Just
four yeaig ago, according to a speech he made
o:: the ferry-boat last nieht, he was ah organi
zer of iiepubiiean clubs in Arkansas, and we
believe he is still a Republican by connection,
although he is always taking a stand that will
give him some c;icÂ«p notoriety.
A few months apo he applied for a parch
ment to practice law from the Supreme Court,
but was reused on account ot ignorance. He
induced a sensational newspaper to print his
picture and a story that ne was turned dowu
on account of his color. We wisn it under
stood that he represents nobody but himself,
and we deprocate any such disgraceful action
as a colored man insulting veterans. Rtsp> ct

ARE OUT OF POLITICS
Berkeley Pro'essors Will Not
Take Any Part in the
Campaign.
Why No Expressions of Political
Opinion Com^ From the Stats
University
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 31.â The close
of the political campaign has arrived and
still no expression of opinion on the issues
of the canvass has come from the State
University professors. The faculty of
Stanford University and of many other
big educational institutions are on record'
and by tlieir expressions of opinion have
added much to the literature, aud espe
cially the Republican literature, of the
campaign; but Berkeley remains silent,
and all efforts to secure a general expres
sion of political views from the faculty of
the University of California have failed.
One or two members of the university
staff of teachers have openly given their
views, notably Professor Howison, profes
sor of moral philosophy and civil polity,
who has declared for McKinley.
Although individuals refuse to be quoted
in the matter private expressions of opin
ion and past statements show that the
faculty of Berkeley is heavily in favor of
the Republican National tick-t.
The reason for the silence of Berkeley's
professors in a* geneial decision tbat the
university, being a State institution,
should keep aloof from all partisanship.
It is said that the university s chances of
an appropriation from the State Legisla
ture would be injured if her professors
were politically active. Now all parties
are expected to vote lor the desired appro
priation, but if a partisan stand should be
taken by tlie faculty, it is declared, only
the party favored could be relied upon to
help the institution.
So, while Stanford's professors have
freely expressed their views and have been
found to be 85 per cent of them in favor
of McKinley, Berkeley's thinkers remain
in the background.

The Clipper Ship Lancing and the Steamer Progreso Nearly Ran Into Each Other on the Night of the 25th Inst Neither Vessel "Was Damaged to Any Great
Extent, but the Escape Was a Narrow One.
SHE IS NOW A
CRACK CLIPPER
The Lancing Was Formerly
a Smart Ocean
Steamer.
Two Years Ago She Was SoM
and Transformed Into a
Sailing Ship.
BEATS HER STEAMER RECORD.
Narrow Escape Daring a Brush With
the Progreso Off the Golden
Gate.
The British ship Lancing now discharg
ing at Green-street wharf is one of ti.e
handsomest vessels in port. She was
originally a steamer and was built for the
French Transatlantic Company a quarter
of a century ago. At that time the vessel
was known as the Periere, having been
named after the millionaire president of
the company. She cost nearly a million
dollars to build and at that time was the
fastest vessel on the run between Europe
and New York. Her best average was
sixteen knots an hour, but during the
last run from Swansea to this port under
sail the vessel made as good as 18 knots
on many occasions.
After posinc as a record-breaker for five
years the Periere was ousted from her
proud position by some of the new trans
atlantic liners and later she was sold to a
syndicate. Captain Hatfield, her com
mander, took charge of the vessel and
changed her into the present magnificent
specimen of marine architecture. She is
fitted with water ballast which can be
loaded or unloaded at the rate of 100 tons
an hour. The cabin accommodations are
of the best and all in all the Lancing is
one of the finest and nio-t commodious
vessels that come to San Francisco.
Captain Hatfield is well known here,
and a more genial or better-liked master
does not come to tins port. On this occa
sion he is accompanied by his wife and
daughter.
Tne erstwhile steamer, and now smart
est sailing vessel afloat, nearly met her
fate on the 21st inst. She was almost in
collision wiih the steamer Progreso, and
both vessels carry marks of the encounter.
Talking about the matter yesterday Cap
tain Hatneld said:
"It was just after midnight, and a high
wind was blowing. We were feeling our
way toward the Golden Gate when all of a
sudden there was a cry of 'Light on the
buÂ»<- board bow!' Before the echoes had
ceased an immense steamer came rushing I
out of the gloom and a dis ist-ous col
lision seemed inevitable. The Lancing's
helm was put hard over, and it seemed an i
etermtv before the ship feil off. "We just
cleared the steamer's browsprit and cat
head while our forebrace fouled his bridge.
"I could almost have jumped aboar<l as
she passed our stern and rushed out of
sight into the foe. The whole affair only
took up a minute of time and nothing
could have saved either vessel if they had
come together. "
Captain "Alec" Swanson brought the
Lancing into port. She came in under
sail and at the time, the bar was breaking.
"I never handled a finer vessel in my
life, and she is the 'dryest' ship I ever set
foot on," was the pilot's comment.
Captain Hatneld was lost in thought for
a moment and then he said: "Captain
Swanson, the ship can take care of herself
for a few moments: let's go and splice the
mainbrace."
"No, sir, " was the answer. "When I
meet you a=hore we'll have a drink to
gether, but not at sea. What I meant by
a dry ship is that, in spitu of her beam, I
have never crossed the bar when it was
breaking in a yes-el that takes as little
water aboard as this one."
The accompanying sketch is drawn
from a picture furnished Mr. Coulter by
Captain Haifield.
The steam whaler Orca got in from the
Arctic yesterday. Although only away
eight months, Captain McGregor has
made the best catch of the season. The
Orca brings back 14,000 pounds of bone,
450 barreis of oil and many foz and bear
skins. There were several desertions at
Point Hope; but the men came back, and
Captain McGregor put them back on the
payroll and said nothing. Some of them
managed to reach Forty-mile Camp, and
are now living on the bounty of those
who have a little to spare in that isolated
spot.
"The buffaloes and the whales are going
out together," said Captain McGregor yes
terday. "It is only here and therein the
Arctic that you will find a whale, and it
is only here and there on the plains that
you will find a buffalo. Sometime^ you
will rhn across a herd, like wo did, and
then you will do well, but more frequently
you will gft nothing. Whaling in the
Arctic is played out, and I think that
next year many practical mea will have a
try at the Antarctic.
The British tramp s earner Undaunted,
which left here with a cargo of wheat
some months ago, arrived at St. Vincent,
CÂ»tpe de Verde Islands, on the 25th inst.
She was orderei to Leith, and will there
receive her final orders.
W. Franks, one of the sailors on the
cruiser Philadelphia, overstayed his 1 aye
and was punished. For several days he
was in solitary confinement, and no lik
ing his quarters sought the first opportu
nity to escape. He crept through the coal
port and swam ashore. For two hours he
was in the water and had a regular fight
for his life. Henry Peterson picked him
up just off Folsom-street wharf, but the
poor fellow was no sooner on dry land
than he was put under arrest and taken
agdin aboard the battleship.
The Pacific Trading Company's whaler
Alexander cot <n from the Arctic yester
day, with 4500 pounds of bone, 100 fuxand
20 beaver skins and 120 pounds of ivory.
Captain Green reports a very poor season,
and says that hardly any of the vessels
will pay expenses.
The schooner Barbara Hernster returned
to port in ballast yesterday. She left here
to load at Devil bi-s Landing, but owing to
the heavy weather she could not get along
side, and consequently had to come back
to San Francisco.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1896.
MODERN SERMON
IN COLUSA STONE
Material That Must Be
Used in the New Mu
nicipal Building.
The Contractors Are Confronted
by Inflexible Specifications
of the Architect
XCLUSION OF OTHER STONE.
Gossip to tbe Effct That the Colusa
Quarries Are Controlled by a
Syndicate.
The specifications according to which
contractors must bid for the construction
of the new municipal building on Kearny
street, from Merchant to Washington,
provide that Colusa sandstone shall be
used. Many contractors regard this limi
tation in the light' of a discrimination
favorable to the owners of the main quarry
near Colusa. It is claimed that other
stone equally as good as that taken from
the Colusa quarry can be supplied freely
and at moderate cost. Contractors aver
that the owners of the Colusa quarry have
advanced the price of their material."
The architects of the building, Mes3rs.
Shea & Shea, were asked yesterday if the
Building Committee of the Board of Su
pervisors designated Colusa stone and in
reply *aid that the specifications directing
the use of that material were drawn by the
architects. It was stated that some kin:i
of stone had to specified so that bidders
would not be offering all kinds of material,
and that as the product of the Colusa
quar ry was acknowledged to be excellent,
and was accepted in the construction of
the new depot, it was deemed fair to use it
in the municipal building.
The architects a.-sert that there is no
monopoly of Colusa stone, as thpre are
several quarries in that region. It was
fancied that the chief opposition came
from contractors who desired to use Ore
gon stone. Mr. Bhea said that stone
would not be used extensively in the con
t-tr iction of the building, as the plans re
quire brick. The stone contract would
amount to $12,000 or $".5,000.
Fiom sources independent of architects
and contractors it was asoertaine t that
good building stone is abundant in Califor
nia. It was said that Messrs. McDonald
and Quinn controlled the Colusa quarries.
A leading citizen who is quite familiar
with building enterpuses said last night:
"The specifications should not have re
| stricted bidders to Colusa stone. There
are numerous quarries producing material
equally as good as the Co usa product.
For example, Sahta Clara County offers
superior stone. There are po d quarries
in other counties. That the Hurbor Com
missioners accepted Colusa stone for the
new depot is no reason that other stone
should be excluded from the new munici
pal building. It may be all ri^ht and ac
cording to the law pertaining to the con
struction of this building to exclude other
than California material, but the exclu
sion should not apply to ail mater. al ex
cept that quarried in the region of Colusa.
'If not too late the specifics lions should
be amended so as to give all contractors a
fair oppartunity. Inferior stone, if of
fered, an be rejected."
There is some gossip to the effect that
Charles Alexander and John C. Quinn,
while the former was State Harbor Com
missioner, secured contiol of the Colusa
"uarry, and that the product is now con
trolled by a syndicate which purchased
their interest, or at least the interest that
Mr. Alexander represented.

This Important Office to Be Filled at

Some time ago, when the case of Young
vs. Babcock was decided by the Supreme
Court in Los Angeles, it was assumed that
the decision meant a two years' term for
Babcock, and the impression went abroad
that tnere - would not be any election for
Superintendent. While the newspapers
have since stated differently the correction
does not 1 seem to have been noticed by
many of the voters. It is important that
citizens should bear this in mind and see
that they get in a vote for this important

"Why, Chief, there are no such animals
out here."
"Yes, there are. I am reading their
names out of a report of the Park Com
missioners.."
"Oh, you make me tired. Those are the
names of plants."
"Eh, what? So they are. That's what
comes from studying Latin by the light of I
a campaign Roman candle. But what's
tbe matter? Tbe animals will not hurt
any on*."
"That's not it. The kids have broken
into tbe memorial museum and have got
out spears, battle-axes, crossbows, bows
and arrows, and are just dragging out two
popgun cannons, and are singing 'We'll
Hunt tbe Buffalo.'"
"Great Scoti!" said the Chief, "suppose
r.ie kids should really hurt those venera
ble animals. We'd have Holbrook and
the whole Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals after us, and there are
not enough jails in San Francisco to hold
all tbe kids." The perspiration rolled
down his face in great drops.
"Hurry up," shouted Thomson, "the
grizzly bear is on his way to the Cliff to
make a call on Mayor Sutro, and fifty kids
in armor are on the trail. They have
pressed into service all of the park donkeys
and have coaxed them into a run."
"Coaxed the donkeys into a run,"
groaned the Chief, "then, indeed, will Hol
brook be after us. But how did the ani- j
mals get out?"
Five minutes later every policeman in
San Francisco had received notice to go to
Golden Gate Park. They filled all the J

Jtadent Plagues
Of Deep-Sea Skips
m
Of the hundreds of ships that pass in
and out of this port every year there is
not one of them that is not, to a greater or
Jess degree, overrun with rats. Especially
is this the case with wheat-laden ships
and vessels carrying food cargoes. Tho
number of vermin which infest these
vessels is simply incredible, in a four
months' voyage, which is the average be
tween this port and Liverpool, the in- '
crease is so great as to cause a sensible
loss in every cargo of wheat shipped.
Tbe rodents seize upon and destroy
everything upon which their sharp teeth j
can make the least impression. The
leather valves of the pumps are a favorite
article of diet of the pests whenever extra
precautions are not taken to guard against
these depredations. How many wooden
vessel" have bren lost through rats boring
holes in the hulls wili never be known. It is
a danger that is ever present and requires
constant watchfulness on tbe part of thÂ»
skipper to guard against.
No vessel chartered with a wheat cargo
fails to bestow a day or two before loading
to clearing tbe hull of rats. A few days i
ago the four-masted British ship Strath- j
olme, lying off section 3. found such
an operation necessary. Every hole that {
would admit a particle of fresh air was j
plugged np, the hatches battened down as I
tight as possible, and then great iron j
plates containing sulphur in large quanti- j
ties were set on fire and allowed to burn j
lor two days. Then the hull was opened j
i Â»nd the carcasses of the dead rats gath
ered in. Their number was immense.
Full four barrels of dead rats were thus j
secured. It was estimated that fully 3000 |
were caught. This was the crop of one j
round voyage.
In less than a year another rat-killing
will be ordered and just as many will be â 
1 taken then.
1 Every vessel sailing out of this port un
dergoes this same experience. From tbi
c&n be imagined the extent of tbe pest
and the immense annoyance and damage
which rats cause to the marine interests
alone.
Thus it may be seen that tbe*e vermin are
enemies to be feared, and tbat they cause
in the long run perhaps as much devasta

They filled hacks and ambulances and ex
press-wagons. Long before they reached
the west end of the panhandle they heard
the hurrahing and shouting of boys, and
lancied they heanl the whistling of mu
seum arrows and the clash of museum
spears on museum shields.
Hardly had they arrived on the scene,
when the First Regiment ot the National
Guard of California and the Naval Reserve,
who were having a joint parade, were on
the scene. The miiitary men were sta
tioned at all the park exits, not :o pre
vent the breaking out of the thoroughly
intimidated and venerable wild beasts,
but to prevent more boys from breaking
in to jo;n in tbe hunt. As it was some of
i the boys crawled between ti.e soldiers
and got into tbe park, and made a mad
I rush for bows and arrows and armor and
{ metallic helmets.
The police were so busy chasing "the
kids" all over the park that they had left
the museum unguarded. Most of tbe his
toric halberds, pikes, South Sea Island
war clubs, crossbows of the days of Wal
lace and Bruce, two-handed swords, real
battle-axes, spears, dar'.s, Zulu shields and
assegais and war-feather headdresses had
been seized with a joyous whoop early in
the proceedings by the newsboys who
were out in the park on a picnic.
But the later comers found flintlock
muskets of tbe days of 1776, guns and
fowling-pieces of the seventeenth century,
aueer old flintlock pistols by the score;
sashes and belts supposed to have been
worn by Captain Kidd and his crew, or
someother equally daring buccaneers: cut
lasses and rusty sabers, with nicks in
them; Daniel Boone'sgun, with his record
chipped into the stock of it; scalping
knives and tomahawks; armor, such as
was worn by the crusaders. The babes who
were too young to wear armor found
drums. One of these drums was as long
as a half barrel and cylindrical, with uni
form diameter from sheepskinned top to

the ceaseless work of rodents could be cal

sum of astonishing magnitude.
Joules for Bear Hunters.
The proper beast for a grizzly bear
hunter to ride is a good mule. Dr. W. F.
Edgar, U. S. A., tells in Recreation way a
mule is best.
The doctor was wandering near a camp
up in Washington Siate on a mule. He
had bis rifle with him and seeing a big
bear in the trail fired. The bear tumbled
over and out of sight. It looked like a
clean kill, and the doctor started toward
the place and was nearly in sight of the
hollow where the bear had disappeared,
when the bear ciimbed up over the edge
and went at him.
It was then that the mule was of the ut
most service. The mule rose on its hind
feet, turned sharp around and headed for
camp. A horse or a mustang wouldn't
have been quick enough, the bear was so
close, but all the hunter had to do was to
hang on. The mule knew what to do with
out being told.

Queer Substitutes for Bullets.
When a hunter in tbe old days lost all
his bullets, or hadn't any to shoot with,
he usually devised substitutes tbat on oc
casion served the purpose well. All sons
of things have been fired at game or In
dians, as the case might be The New
York Sun says that old Hank Ellison, iiv

his dying day how be was cooped up by
Indians out West once with a little lead,
lots of powder, a belt full of gold nuggets,
a fine rifle and a bullet-mold. It was on
the top of a knoll wh< re bis log cabin bad

and a lot of wood for emergencies. The
Indians Kept just out of range, dashing in
once in a while to draw his tin-. He coon
used his bullets up, and then used >he

the redskins before they left him.
Many a hunter has used a pebb c in the
hope of getting a close deadly shot.

shaped much like a toadstool and was
once used by Zuni Indians.
"Hurrah! there he is," burst forth a
chorus of youthful voices in the brush.
"Vi, see the buffalo skip," answered the
other boys.
Above the shouts of the eager young
hunters was heard the beating of tbe Zuni
war drum and of the drums which once
stirred the martial heart of Miles Standish.
Every hill, every copse and bit of tan
gle i brushwood, every drive, pedestrian
path and lovers' lane swarmed and ran
over with boys. Wherever the police cap
tured one who might be a menace to the
animals forty other boys seemed to spring
up in his place, for the news spread among
the boys from North Beach to Bay View
and from the Barbary Coast to Richmond
with lightning speed, and there was not
one boy itj town who did not want to take
part in a hunt royal in which tbe animals

Elks, just sixteen of them.

"was a dandy."'

good for a fight."

Spotted deer, two.
White-tailed deer. fonr.
Was there a boy in San Francisco who
had not his fondest wi-h gratified? Not
one who managed to squeeze into the park
and who thought tbat he had a chance to
capture, single handed, the bear, and go
thundering down through the corridors of
time as "Grizzly Bear Bob, the boy hero
of the Pacific."' For every boy was bound
to hunt tbe prizzly first, the buffalo second
and the kangaroo third and the deer when
he got time for it. There was not a boy

there was not a boy of them who thought
of running away.

thought would prevent the grizzly from
scratching him with its awful claws if it
should come to a band-to-hand, man-to
bear stand-up figbt. In his grasp he had
a two-handed sword with a blade three
and a half feet long. He bad on Captain
Kidd's belt, and in it were pistols and
dirks enough to furnish a small arsenal.
Not far away, with his ear applied to
the ground, after the fashion of the "Deer-
Slayer" of whom Fenimore Cooper tells,
"Get-there Harry," another newsboy,

Some one's curly headed darling, whose
long wavy hair of silken texture had won
him the name of "Buffalo Bill," two
minutes after he entered this wild beast
arena, stalked abroad horrid with a battle
ax over his shoulder and with a Zulu
shield over his brave bosom. The battle
ax had a helve four feet long and what

he could hardly stagger along.

the boys on this occasion. There was one
lad who strutted about in a Continenta
uniform with old-time sword, which was
drawn and ready "to stab de bear wid."
Where did the animals all go? The
grizzly ambled leisurely out toward Mayor
Sutro's. The buffaloes started to browse
in a herd on a green and inviting bed of
ornamental foliage until the newsboy
"wild West party" on the paik's donkeys
rus ed at them as fast as they could make
the donkeys trot. Then they were off line
wind.
â¢'Gee," yelled the boys, "jest see 'em go.
Bring outde caunon and we'll mow down
de drove."
Then It was that the two historic can
non came from the museum and were
placed in charge of an "artillery com
pany," who found powder somewhere and
loaued up their guns with paper wads and
round stones from the museum, stones
which came from a sacrificial pyre erected
by the ancient Aztecs. These boys "stood
to their gains" until Captain Thomson
swooped down upon them with a mounted
squad.
Meanwhile the hunt went merrily on
over hill and dale. The boys hunted the
wild animals and the police hunted tbe
boys to protect tbe wild animals from
harm. The news becoming generally dis
persed the people of the City left their
homes and shops and stores and offices
and poured nickels into the streetcar treas
ury of Mr. Huntington's Market-street
railway system at an alarming rate.
People rode on the roofs of tbe cars and
"hung on by the eyelids" to get there.
The news spread across the bay and all
the people came in from Alameda, Santa
Clara, Contra Costa, Marin and San Mateo
counties. The big hotels were cleared of
guests. . The cooks and waiters threw
down their aprons and culinary imple
ments and left tbe viands to burn on the
ranges. Finally even the ferry-boats and
streetcar lines were abandoned by their
crews, who could no longer stand the
strain.
In horrid fancy the perturbed people
beard the fierce growls of the grizzly and
the shrieks of small children who were
being chased up a tree. Perhaps, ah!
perhaps even now native sons and native
daughters were being torn by cruel claws
and their tender limbs' were being crunched
by tbe terrible teeth of the bear. Faces
blanched and hands trembled at tbe
thought of tbe buffaloes.
Those ponderous hirsute masses, the
once undisputed and lordly monarebs of
the vast and ocean-wide prairies, what
might not the fierce buffaloes do? Under
t. eir spurning feet the green sward might
be torn a? with lowered head* they rushed
madly onward to annihilate whole battal
ions of small boys at. once, who thought it
the best of fun, in their toolhardiness, to
"hunt the buffalo" in the armor of the
dark ages.
Then the malicious, hopping kangaroo,
the menacing stranger from the land of
tbe bushmen and tbe black "bush track
ers," the intimate of the cannibals of
New Guinea, that travesty and sport of
Mother Nature, combining the agility of
the grasshopper and some of its playful
habits of locomotion with the temp r of
Satan and the speed and strength of the
wild horss of Arabia. Is not tbe kanga
roo a boxer and a gouger and a horrible
fellow generally?
These thoughts caused paternal and ma
ternal pulses to quicken. Babies by the
scores and hundreds and thousands were
left squalling and wailing, while the
fathers and mothers, finding that tbe
nursegirls and servant-girls had already
fled, hurried valorously to the park to
gallantly take part in any wild-beast
melee necessary to rescue their threatened
offspring. In brief, the City was de
serted, for it had moved en masse to. the
park. The serried mothers and fathers
swept down upon the thin line of the
military cordon and swept them away as
chaff flies before the wind.
Then there ensued such scenes as would
make a Comanche smile and a crusader
chuckle. Straight to their prey, led by
unerring maternal instinct; looking not
for trails or paths, reeking not of big griz
zlies, bopping hangaroos, charging buffa
loes or deers with branching and sharp
pointed antlers, onward rushed regiments
and army corps of eager women. Quicker
than it could be told Mnall boys, wearing
casques and visors drawn and generally
appareled in a fantastic way, were thrown
over maternal knees and spanked, while
armor rattled and small boys wailed lus
tily.

THE POTENT HAND THAT QUELLED THE TUMULT.
/\ Boom in Uncle
Sam's /\rctic Estate
The thirtieth anniversary of the absorp
tion of the Territory of Alaska by the
United States will occur next year, and it
is certain t: at advantage will be taken of
the fact to draw renewed attention to the
wonderful resources of that remarkable
re e ion.
The present year makes an era in the
career of the Territory. For tbe first time
the Government lias made the attempt to
give some sort of mail service to tbe in
terior points and has been fairly success
ful in so doing. Tbe mail is now carried
by paid t fficers of the Government, and
not depending upon the chance traveler
for its delivery. The great religious de
nominations, recognizing the future possi
bilities of Alaska as the homo of a large
population, have turned their attention to
the north and established >chools, hospi
tals and churches for civilizing the na
tives and giving them instruction in moral
principlps.
The $7,500,000 paid for the territory was
really and* diplomatically the reward given
Rus-ia for the moral support she accorded
this country at a critical period of the
War of the Rebellion. If the diplomats
who thus disposed of a territory embrac
ing upward of 800,000 square mi es at a
cost of about 1)4 cents an acre had known
w at the resources of Alaska in the year of
erace 1897 would be n is more than proba
ble that less unwillingness on the part of
Russia in disposing and the United States
in receiving this vast territory would have
been exhibited.
The season has closed in Alaska for
1896, and the reports of commerce enable
an estimate to be made of tbe year's
productiveness From the fisheries a
total of $3,500,000 has been realized ; from
the mines an estimate of $4,000,000 is con
sidered about the actual result, and from
furs another million is added, so that from
three industries alone the aggregate
amounts to $9,500,000. This leaves out of
consideration me whale fishery, which is
valued at half a million dollars a year,
and lumber, which is the ultimate source
from which the supplies of the coast must
be obtained.
In consequence of the influx of miners
into the Yukon and Cooks Inlet, Alaska
has received a greater influx of citizans
than ever before. Probably an addition
of one-third has been made to tbe popula
tion of the Territory in the last year. The
j King Philip of the Narragansetts and the
i war plumes of Shacknasty Jack dusting
the main drive, while Smith junior, un
afraid of the monarch 01 iiie fastnesses of
the -Sierra, openeit his mouth wide and
yelled like somebody being tortured by
redskins at the stake.
What the poiice could not do the
mothers accomplished with neatness and
dispatch. They brought down small boys
from trees and captured them as they
were chasing the deer around the islands
j in Sow Lake, the Berce young hunters,
pausing with arrow on bowstring and
spear drawn back to throw. The maternal
command did this. So finally into the
concourse fronting the music-stand was
rounded up a rare collection of knights,
Fiji and other warriors, deerslayers and
tiizzly bear hunters, amateur hunters of
the Australian bush country, Wanipanoags
and so on, all in miniature.
The bad boys did not seem to be as easily
j caught as the good boys. They had to be
j corralled between lines of policemen and
mothers and fathers. Then they dropped
lariats, doub e-ended war clubs, poisoned
darts and all tbe toggery which makes
the Midwinter Memorial Fair Museum
noteworthy. All at once the fond mothers
got a scare. They skedaddled with their
charges in all directions.
Just at dusk the buffaloes, deer and
kangaroo, having kept out of the way all
day, stole shamefacedly back to their
comfortable pen, where there was enough
to eat and drink and no bad boys to hunt
I them and make them afraid. The grizzly
| was lassoed by the park police and placed
once more in bis den. He had lunched at
Mayor Sutro's grounds on two or three
dogs, but he did not care much for dog.
Now the horrid bear is protected by a
sign bearing this inscription:
: DO NOT TEASE THE BEAR OR THROW *
I ANYTHING WITHIN THE IXCLOSCRE. !
So he is safe from the boys, and the po
lice achieved, with the help of the popu
lace, and especially through the aid of the
mothers of San Francisco, a glorious
victory. The armor and arms have been
restored to their places in the park mu
-1 scum.
difficulty of procuring exact estimates of
the value of Alaska productions in the
earlier years of the occupation by the
United States makes it difficult to get at
the true value, but authorities are unani
mous in the conviction that Alaska has
raid for itself ten times over in her pro
ductions oi the past thirty years. This
estimate is regarded as extremely conser
vative.
The year 1897 will see a continuance of
the immigration of miners to tbe Yukon.
The sources of tbe placer gold taken
from the head waters of that migh y stream
have not yet been discovered. The search
for the quariz deposits of the Yukon will
be prosecuted more eagerly than ever
next year. These undoubtedly exist, and
there is no climatic difficulty why, when
once discovered, these mines cannot be
operated during the entire year. A rail
road to the headwaters of the Yukon is
one of tbe possibilities of the next few
years, and its construction presents no es
pecial difficulties. There, the quartz de
posits, which extend to tbe remotest limit
if tbe chain of mountains, south, begin,
and their discovery will make a new epoch
in the history of that Territoiy.
The people of Alaska, under the leader
ship of the Governor, propose an exposi
tion at Sitka next year, and are preparing
for the event through agents to ail accessi
ble points. The aborigines have been in
vited to contribuie their choicest speci
mens of art, and all dwellers oi the Terri
tory will be a-ked their assistance in mak
ing a full exhibit of the wonderful re
sources of the dependency. Such an ex
hibition would be unique, novel and at
tractive, and draw to it the attention of
the whole United States. Thousands of
travelers in search of a new sensation
would embrace the opportunity of visit
ing the land that inevitably, at no distant

ment. ________^____

A PASSION
IN THE DESERT
"It is a terrible sight!" she exclaimed, as we left the menagerie of
Monsieur Martin.
Bhe bad just been witnessing this daring showman "performing' 1 in
the cage of his hyena.
"By what means," she went on, "can he have so tamed these animals
as to be secure of their affection?"
"What seems to you a problem," I responded, interrupting her, "is
in reality a fact of nature."
"Oh !" sbe exclaimed, with an incredulous smile.
"Yon think, then, that animals are devoid- of passions?" I asked her.
"You must know that we can teach them all the qualities of civilized
existence."
Sbe looked at me with an astonished air.
"But," I went on. "when I first saw Monsieur Martin I confess that,
like yourself, I uttered an exclamation of surprise. I happened to be
standing by the side of an old soldier, whose right leg had been ampu
tated, and who had come in with me. I was struck by his appearance. His
was one of those intrepid heads, stamped with the seal of war, upon whose
brows are written the battles of Napoleon. About this old soldier was a
certain air of frankness and gayety which always gains my favor. He was,
doubtless, one o; those old troopers whom nothing carl surprise: who find
food for laughter in the dying spasms of a comrade, who gayly bury and
despoil him, who challenge bullets with indifference â though their argu
ments are short enoughâ and who would hob-nob with the devil. Alter
keenly looking at the showman as he was coming from the cage my neigh
bor pursed his lips with that significant expression of contempt which su
perior men assume to show their difference from the dupes. At my ex
clamation of surprise at Monsieur Martin's courage he smiled, and, nod
ding with a knowing air, remarked, 'I understand all that.'
"'How?' I answered. 'If } r ou can explain this mystery to me you
will oblige me greatly.'
"In a few moments we bad struck up an acquaintance, and went to
dine at tbe first restaurant at hand. At dessert a bottle of champagne
completely cleared the memory of this strange old soldier. He toid bis
story, and I saw he was right when he exclaimed, 'I understand all
that. 1 "
When we got home she teased me so, and yet so prettily, that I con
sented to write out for her the soldier's reminiscences.
The next day sLe received this episode, from an epic that might be
called "Tbe French in Epypt."
During the expedition undertaken in Upper Egypt by General Desaix,
a Provencal soldier, who had fallen into the bands of the Msugrabins, was
taken by these Arabs into the desert beyond the cataracts of the Nile. In
order to put between them and the French army a distance to assure their
safety the Maugrabms made a forced march and did not halt until night.
They then camped by tbe side of a weJl, surrounded by a clumpof palm
trees, where they had before buried some provisions.
Never dreaming that their r>risoner would think of flight, they merely
bound his hands, and all of them, after eating a few dates and giving
barley to their horses, went to sleep. When the bold Provencal caw bis
enemies incapable of watching him.be picked up 9 scimitar with his
teeth, and then, with the blade fixed between bis knees, cut the cords
that lashed bis wrists and found himself at liberty. He at once seized a
carbine and a dagger; provided himseli with some dry dates and a small
bag of barley, powder and bali*; girded on the scimitar, sprang on a horse
and pressed forward in the direction where he fancied the French army
must be found. Impatient to regain the bivouac, he so ureeii the weary
horse that the poor beast fell dead, its sides torn with the spurs, leaving
the Frenchman alone in the midst of the desert.
After wandering for some time amid the sand with the desperate
courage of an escaping convict, the solder was forced to Hop. Night was
cJosing in. Despite the beauty of the Eastern nigat, be had not strength
sufficient to go on. Fortunately he had reached a height on the top of
vriiich were palm trees, wuose leaves, for some time visible far off, had
awakened in his heart a hope of safety. He was so weary that he lay down
on a granite stone, oddly shaped like a camp-bed, and went to sleep, with
out taking the precaution to protect himself in his slumber. He nad
sacrificed his life, and bis last thought was a reeret for having left the
Maugrabins, whose wandering life began to please him, now tbut he was
far from them and from all hope of succor.
He was awakened by the sun, whose pitiless rays falling vertically
upon tbe granite made it intolerably hot. For the Provencal had been so
careiesE as to cast himself upon the ground in the direction opposite to
that on which the green majestic palmtops threw their shadow. He
looked at these solitary trees and shuddered. They reminded him of the
graceful shafts surmounted by long foils that distinguish the Saracenic
columns of the Cathedral of Aries. He counted the few palms; then
looked about him. A terrible despair eeized upon his soul. He saw a
boundless ocean. The melancholy sands spread round him, glittering like
a blade of eteel in a bright light, as far as eye could see. He knew not
whether he was gazing on an ocean or a chain of lakes as lustrous as a
mirror. A fiery mist shimmered in little ripples above the tremulous
landscape. The &ky possessed an oriental blaze, tbe brilliancy which
brin ga despair, seeing that it leaves tbe imagination nothing to desire.
Heaven and earth alike were all aflame. The silence was terrible in its
wild and awful majesty. Infinity, immensity, oppressed the soul on
all sides; not a cloud v.as in the sky, not a breath was in tbe air,
not a movement on the bosom of the sand, which undulated into tiny
waves. Far away the horizon was marked off, as on a summer day at sea,
by a line of light as bright and narrow as a saber's edge.
The Provencal clasped his arms about a palm tree as if it bad been the
body of a friend. Then, sheltered by the straight and meager sbadow, he
sat down weeping ou the granite, and looking with deep oread upon the
lonely scene spread out before bis eyes. He cried aloud as if to tempt the
solitude. His voice, lost in the hollows of the height, gave forth far-off a
ieeble sound that woke no echo; the echo was within his heart!
The Provencal was 22 years old. He loaded his carbine.
"Time enough for that!" be muttered to himself, placing the weapon
of deliverance on tbe ground.
Looking by turns at the melancholy waste of sand and at the bine
expanse of sky, the soldier dreamed of France. W T ith delight he fancied
that be smelt the Paris nutters, and recalled the towns through which he
bad passed, the faces of his comrades, and the slightest incidents of his
life. Then bis Southern imagination made him fancy, in the play of beat
quivering above the plain, the pebbles of his own dear Provence. But
tearing all tbe dangers of this cruel mirage, be went down in the direction
opposite to that whicn be had taken when be had climbed tbe bill the
night before. Great was His joy on discovering a kind of protto, naturally
cut out of the enormous fragments of the granite that formed the bottom
of tbe bill. The remnants of a mat showed that this retreat had once
been inhabited. Then, a few steps further, he saw palm trees with a load
of dates. Again the instinct which attaches mau to life awoke within bis
heart
He now hoped to live until the passing of some Mauerabin; or per
haps he would soon hear the boom of cannon, for at that time Bonaparte
was overrunning Egypt. Revived by this r-flection, the Frenchman cut
down a few bunches of ripe fruit, beneata whose weight the date trees
seemed to bend, and felt sure, on tasting this unhoped-for manna, tnat
the inhabitant of this grotto had cultivated the palm trees. The fresh
and luscious substance of the date bore witness to his predecessor's care.
Tne Provencal passed suddenly from dark despair to well-nigh insane
delight He climbed the hill again, and spent the remainder of the day
iv cutting down a barren i>alm tree whicu the night before had served
him for shelter.
A vague remembrance made him think of the wild beasts; and, fore
seeing that they might come to seek the spring which bubbled through
the sand among the rocks, be resolved to secure himself against their
visit* by placing â¢ barrier at tbe door of his hermitage. In spite of fail

exertions, in spite of the strength with which the fear of being eaten
during sleep endured him.it was impossible lor him to cut the palm to
pieces in one day; but he contrived to bring it down. When, toward
evening, the monarch of the cr^ert fell the thunder of its crash resounded
far, as if the mighty solitude had given forth a moan. The soldier shud
dered as if he bad beard a voice that prophesied misfortune. But like un
heir who does not long bewail the death of a relation, he stripped the tree
of the broad, long, green leaves, and used them to repair the mat on
which be was about to lie. At length, wearied by the heat and by his
labors, he fell asleep beneath the red roof of bis murky grotto.
In the middle of the night he was disturbed by a strange noise. He
sat up; in ihe profound silence he could hear a creature breathincâ a
savage respiration which resembled nothing human. Terror, intensified
by darkness, silence, and the fancies of one suddenly awakened, froze bis
blood. He felt the sharp contraction of bis scalp when, as the pupils of
his eyes dilated, he sÂ«w in the shadow two faint and yellow lights. Ac
first, he thought these lights were some reflection of hja eyeballs, but soon,
the clear briehtness of the night helping him to distinguish objects in the
grotto, he saw, lying at two paces ironi him, an enormous beast!
Was it a lion?â a tiger 7â a crocodile? The Provencal was cot suf-
ficiently educated to know tbe species of his enemy, but bis terror was ail
the greater, sonce bis ignorance assisted his imagination. He bore the
cruel torture of listening:, of marking tbe caprices of this awful breathing,
wit hont losing a sound of it or venturing to make tbe slightest move
ment. A smell as pungent as a iox's, but more penetrating, tilled the
grotto, and when it entered his nostrils his terror passed ail bounds; he
could no longer doubt the presence of tbe terrible companion whuse royal
den was serving him for bivouac. Presently tbe moon, now sinking,
lighted up the den, and in the moon-rays gradually shone out a panther's
spotted skin.
Tbe lion of Egypt was sleeping, curled up like a great dog who is the
peaceable possessor of a sumptuous kennel at a n.ansion door; its eyes,
which had been opened for one moment, were now closed again. Its face
was turned toward the Frenchman.
A t ousand troubled thoughts passed through the mind of the
panther's prisoner. At rim he thouehr of shooting it; but there was not
enough room between them to adjust bis gun; tbe barrel would have
reached beyond the animal. And what if be awoke it I This supposition
made turn njotioniess. Listening in the silence to the beating of his
heart, he cursed the loud pulsations, fearing to disturb the sleep that gave
him time to seek some means of safety. Twice be placed his hand upon
bis scimitar, with tbe intention of cutting off tbe head of bis enemy; but
the difficulty of cutting ihxough the short, strona fur compelled him to
abandon the idea. To fail was certain death. He preferred the odds of
conflict, and determined to await the daybreak. And d&y.i^ht was not
long in com in p. Tbe Frenchman was able to examine the panther. Its
muzzle was stained with blood.
"It has eaten plenty," he reflected, without conjecturing that tbe
feast might have been composed of human flesh, "it will not be hungry
when it wakes."
It was a female. The fur upon ber breast and thiehs Rhone with
whiteness. A number cf little spots like velvet looked like charming
bracelets around ber paws. The muscular tail was also white, but tipped
with black rins-s. Toe upper part of her coat, yellow as old gold, but very
soft and smooth, bore tnose characteristic marks, shaded into the form of
roses, which serve to distinguish tbe panther from the other species of the
genus Feiis. This fearful visitor was snoring tranquilly in an attitude as
graceful as that of a kitten lying on the cushions of an ottoman. Her
sinewy, blood-stained paws, with powerful claws, were spread beyond her
bead, which rested on them, and from which stood out the thin, straight
wbisfc-rs with a gleam like silver wires.
If sbe had been imprisoned in a ctge, the Provencal would assuredly
have admired the creature's grace, and tbe vivid contrasts of color that
gave her garment an imperial lr.s:er; but at this moment he felt his sight
grow dim at her sinister aspect. The presence of the camber even
sleeping, made him experience tbe effVct which tbe magnetic eve 3of tbe
serpent are said to exercise upon tbe nightingale.
In the presence of this danger tbe courage of the soldier faltered al
though without doubt it would have risen at the cannon's mouth.' A
desperate thought, however, tilled bis mind, and dried up at iv source the
chilly moisture which was rolling down bis forehead. -Acting as men do
who, driven to extremities, at last defy their fate, and nerve themselves
to meet fheir doom, he saw a tragedy in this adventure, and resolved to
play his part in it with honor to the last.
â¢â¢Two days ago," he argued with himself, "the Arabs might have
killed me."
Considering himself as good as dead, he waited bravely, yet with
restless curiosity, for the awakening of his enemy.
When the sun shone out tbe panther opened her eyes 3uddenly â  then
she spread out ber paws forcibly, as if to stretch them and get rid of
cramp. Then she yawned, showing an alarming set of teeth and an
indented, rasp-like tongue.
'she is like a dainty lady!" thought the Frenchman, as he saw her
rolling over with a gentle and coquettish movement.
Sne licked off the blood that stained her raws and mouth, and rubbed
her head with movements full .of charm.
"That's is! Just beautify yourself a little!' 1 the Frenchman said his
gayety returning with his courage. "Then we must say good-morning "
And he took up tbe short dagger of which be had relieved tbe Mau
grabins.
At this moment the panther turned her head toward the Frenchman
and looked at him fixedly without advancing. The rigidity of those
metallic eyes and their insupportable brigbtuess made the Provencal
shuader. The beast began to move toward him. He looked at her caress
ingly, and, fixing his eyes as if to magnetise her, he let her come close up
to him; then, with a soft and gentle gesture, he passed his hand along ber
body, from head to taiJ, acratchingwith bis nai.s tbe flexible vertebras that
divide a panther's yellow back. The beast put up her tail with pleasure;
her eyes grew softer; and wben, for the third time, the Frenchman ac
complished this self-interested piece of flattery, she broke into a purring
like a cat. But this purr proceeded from a throat bo deep and powerful
that it re-echoed through the grotto like the peals of a cathedral organ.
The Provencal, realizing the success of his caresses, redoubled them, until
the imperious beauty was completely soothed and lulled.
When he felt sure tbat be had perfectly subdued the ferocity of his
capricious companion, whose hunger had been satisfied so cruelly the
night before, ba got up to leave the grotto. The panther let him go, but
when he had climbed the hill she came bounding after him with the
lightness of a sparrow hopping from branch to branch, and rubbed herself
against the soldier's leg, arching her back after the fashion of a cat. Then
looking at her guest with eyes whose brightness had grown less inflexible
she uttered that bava^e cry which naturalists have compared to the
sound of a saw.
"What an exacting beauty!" cried the Frenchman, smiling. He set
himself to play with her ears, to caiess her body and to scratch ber head
hard with his nails. Then, growing bolder with success, he tickled her
skull with tbe point of his dagger, watching lor the spot to strike her.
But the hardness of the bones made him afraid of failing.
The sultana of the desert approved tbe action of her slave by raising
her head, stretching her neck and snowing her delight by tbe quietness
of her attitude. The Frenchman suddenly reflected that in order to
assassinate this fierce princess with one blow be need only stab her in
the neck. He had just raised Lis knife for the attempt when the pan
ther, with a graceful action, threw herself upon the ground before his
feet, casting him from time to time a look in which, in spite of its
ferocity of nature, there was a gleam of tenderress.
The poor Proveucal, with his back against a palm tree, ate his dates,
while he cast inquiring glances, now toward the desert for deliverers, now
upon his terrible companion, to keep an eye upon her dubious clemency.
Every time he threw away a date stone, the panther fixed her eyes upon
the spot with inconceivable mistrust. She scrutinized the Frenchman
with a businesslike attention; but the examination seemed favorable, for
when be finished bis poor meal, she licked bis boots, and with her rough.
stroii': tongue removed the dust incrusted in their creases.
"But when she becomes hungry?" thought the Provencal.
Despite the shudder this idea caused him, the soldier began examining
with curiosity the proportions of the panther, certainly one of the most
beautiful specimens of h*r kind. Sbe wasrthree feet high and four feet
long, without the tail. This powerful weapon, as round as a club, waa
nearly three feet long. The beadâ large as that of a lionessâ was distin
guished by an expression of rare delicacy; true, the cold cruelty ot the
tiger dominated, but there was also a resemblance to the features of a
wily woman. In a word, the countenance of the solitary queen wore at
this moment an expression of fierce gayety, like that of Nero flushed with
wine; she had quenched her thirst in blood, and now desired to play.
The soidier tried to come and go, and the panther let him, content to
follow him with her eyee, but less after tbe manntr of a faithful dog than
of a great Angora cat, suspicious even of the movements of its master.
When he turned round be saw beside the fountain tbe carcass of his horse;
the panther bad dragged the tody all that distance. About two-thirds
had been devoured. This sight reassured the Frenchman. He was thus
easily able to explain the absence of the panther, and the respect which
she had shown for him while he was sleeping.
This first piece of luck emboldened him about the future. He con
ceived the mad idea of setting up a pleasant household life, together
with the panther, neglecting no means of pacifying her and of conciliat
ing ber good graces. He returned to her, and saw, to his delight, that
the moved her tail with an almost imperceptible motion. Then he sat
down leside her 'riihout fear and began to play with her; ne grasped
her paws, her muzzle, pulled her ears, threw her over on ber back, and
vigorously scratched her warm and silky sides. Sbe lethini have his way,
and wben the soldier tried to smooth the fur upon her paws she carefully
drew in ber claws, which had the curve of a Damascus blade.
The Frenchman, who kept one hand upon his dagger, was still
thinking of plunging it into the body of the too-confiding panther; but
he feaied lest the should strangle him in her last convulsions. And
besides, within nis heart there was a movement of remorse that warned
him to respect an inoffensive creature. It seemed to him that be bad

woman whom he had once loved, whom he had sarcastically nick.
name t "Mignonne," from her jealousy, which was so tierce that during
the whole time of their acquaintance he went in fear that she would stab
him. Ths memory cf his youth suggested the idea of calling the
young panther by this name, whose lithe agility and grace he cow ad
mired with less terror.
Toward evening he bad become so far accustomed to his perilous po
sition that be almost liked the hazard of it. At last his companion bad
got into the habit of looking at him wben he called in a falsetto voice,
"Mignonne."
At sundown Mignonne uttered several times a deep and melan
choly cry.
"Sue has been properly brought up," thought the ligbt-hearted soldier:
''she says her prayers." But it was, no doubt, her peaceful attitude which
brought the jest into his wind.
"All right, my little pet; I will let you get to sleep first," be said, rely
ing on his legs to get away as soon as she was sleeping, and to seek boine
other shelter for the night.
The soldier waited with patience for tbe hour of flight, and, wheu it
came, set out full speed iv the direction of the Nile. But he had only
gone a quarter of a league across the sand when he heard the panther
bounding after him, uttering at intervals that saw-like cry, more terrible
even than the thudding of her leap*.
"Well!" be said to himself, "she most have taken a fancy to me.
Perhaps she has never yet met any one. It is flattering to be her fint
love!" At this moment the Frenchman fell into a shifting qaicksaod, so
dangerous to the traveler in the desert, escape from which is hopeless.
He felt that he was sinking; he gave a cry of terror. The panther seized
him by the collar with her teeth, and xpringine backward with stupen
dous vigor drew him from the gulf as if Dy magic.
"Ah! Mignonne!" cried the soldier, enthusiastically caressing ncr,
"we are friends now for life and death. But no tricks, eh?" and he re
traced his steps.
Henceforth the desert was as though it had been peopled. It con
tained a being with whom he could converse, and whose ferocity had
been softened lor him, without his being able to explain so strange a
friendship.
However great was his desire to keep awake and on his guard, he fell
asleep. On awakening, Mignonne was no longer to be seen. He climbed
the iiill and then perceived her afar off, com in? along by leaps and
bound*, according to the nature of these creatures, the extreme flexibility
of whose vertebrae prevents their running.
I PLUNGED MY DAGGER LNTO HER NECK.
Mignonne came up, her jaws besmeared with blood. She received
the caress of her companion with deep purrs of satisfaction. Her eyes,
now full of softness, were turned with greater tenderness than tbe night
before, to the Provencal, who spoke to her as to a pet.
"Ah! Beauty 1 you are a respectable young woman, are you not?
You like petting, don't you? Are you not ashamed of yourself ? You
have been eating a Maugrabin! Well! they're animals, as you are. But
uon": you go and gobble up a Frenchman. If you do, I shall aot love
you!"
She played as a young pup plays with its master, letting him roll her
over, beat and pet her; and sometimes she would coax him to caress her
with a movement of entreaty.
A few days passed thus. This companionship revealed to the Proven
cal the sublime beauties of the desert. From the moment when he found
within its hours of fear and yet of calm a sufficiency of food, and a living
creature who absorbed his thoughts, his soul was stirred by new emotions.
It was a Jife of contrasts. Solitude revealed to him her secrets, and in
volved him in her charm. He discovered in the rising and tbe setting of
tbe sun a splendor hidden from the world of men. His frame quivered
when he heard above bis head the soft whirr of a bird's wingsâ rare way
far-r; or when he saw the cloud6â those chan eful, many-colored
voyagers â mingle in the depth of heaven. In the dead of night he studied
the effects of the moon upon the sea of sand, which the simoon drove in
ever-changing undulations. He lived with the Oriental day; he marveled
at its pomp and glory; and often, after having watched the grandeur of a
tempest in the pain, in which the sands were whirled in dry red mists of
deadly vapor, be beheld with ecstasy the coming on of night, for then
there fell upon him the benignant coolness of the stars. He beard imag
inary music in tbe sky. Solitude taught him all the bliss of reverie. He
spent whole hours in calling trifles to remembrance, in comparing bis past
life with his strange present. To his panther he crew passionately at
tached, for he required an object of affection. Whether by a strong effort
of his will he bad really changed the character of bis companion, or
whether, thanks to the constant warfare of thedeserts, she found sufficient
food, she showed no disposition to attack him, and at last, in her perfect
tameness, he no longer felt the slightest fear.
He spent a great part of his time in sleeping, but ever, like a spider in
his web, with mind alert, that he might not let deliverance escape him
should any chance to pass within the sphere described by the horizon.
He bad sacrificed his shirt to make a flag, which he had hoisted to the
summit of a palm tree stripped of leaves. Taught by necessity, he had
found the means to keep it spread by stretching it with sticks, lest the
wind should fail to wave it at the moment when the hoped-for traveler
might be traveling the waste of sand.
It was durinc the long hours wben hope abandoned him that he amused
himself with his companion. He had learned to understand (he different
inflections of her voice and the expression of her glances; he had studied
tbe varying changes of the spots tbat starred her robe of cold. Mignonne
no longer growled even when he seized her by the tuft with which her ter
rible tail ended to count the black and white rings which adorned it, and
which glittered in the sun like precious gems.
It delighted him to watch the delicate soft lines of her snowy breast
and graceful bead. But above all when she was gamboling in her play
be watched her with delight, for tbe agility, the youthfulness of ail her
movement?, filled him with an ever fresb surprise. He admired her sup
pleness in leaping, climbing, gliding, pressing close against him, swaying,
rolling over, crouching for a bound. But however swift ncr spring, how
ever slippery tbe block of granite, sbe would stop short, without motion,
at the sound of the word "Mienonne!"
One day, in the most dazzling sunshine, an enormous bird was hover
ing in the air. The Provencal left his panther to examine the new visitor,
but after waiting for a moment the deserted sultana uttered a hoarse
growl.
"Blessed if I don't believe tbat she is jealous!" be exclaimed, per
ceiving that her eyes were once more hard and rigid. "A woman's soul
has passed into her body, that is certain!"
Tbe eagle disappeared in air, while be admired afresh the rounded
back and graceful outlines of the panther. She was as pretty aa a woman.
The blond fur blended in its delicate gradations into the dull white color
of tbe thighs. The brilliant sunshine made this vivid gold, with spots of
brown, lake on a luster indescribable.
The Provencal and the panther looked at one another unders tandingly ;
the beauty of the desert quivered wben she felt the nails of her admirer on
her skull. Her eyes gave forth a flash like lightning, and then she closed
them hard.
"She has a soul,' : he cried, as ho beheld the cUsert queen in her repose,
golden as tbe sands, white as their blinding luster, and like them, fiery
and alone.
"Well?" she said to me, "I have read your pleading on behalf of ani
mals. But what was the cud of these two persons so well made to. under
stand each other."
â¢'Ah! They ended as all great passions end â through a misunder
standing. Each thinks the other gnilty of a falsity, each is too pro ad for
explanation, and obstinacy brings about a rupture."
"And sometimes in the happiest moments," she said, "a look, an ex
clamation, is enough! Well, what was the end of the story?'
"That is difficult to tell, but you will understand what the old fellow
bad confided to me, when, finishing his bottle of champagne, he exclaimed
'I don't know bow I hurt her, but she turned on me like mad, and with
her sharp teeth seized my thigh.
"The action was not savage; but fancying that she meant to kill me, I
plung dmy dagger into her neck. She rolled over with a cry" tbat froze
my blood; she looked at me in her last struggles without anger. I would
have given everything on earth, even my crossâ which tben I had not
wonâ to bring her back to life. It was as if I had slain a human being.
And tbe soldiers who had seen my flag, and who were hastening to my
succor, found me bathed in tears.
A PLEAT FROM THE HEART
OF THE HOME
A WOMAN'S ADDRESS TO THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA.
The steady, unswerving march cf time is bringing to ua the 3d of No
vember, when you will chronicle by your votes how far you have advanced
as a State with the stream of progress that constantly flows on throughout
all ages. Do not merit the scorn of the fnture generations by refusing to
give the ballot to women ! You now look bacK along tbe years of tfce past
and sniiie in derision at tbe time wben women were not allowed to study
by your side; and further back wben it was considered unwomanly for
women to study mathematics; and still further back when in a dignified
council it was a suoject of debate to discover whether women had souls
and had any chance of ever going to heaven! You wouid scorn to be
classed with those men, but will you not be numbered with them if you
fail to make the sixth amendment a law of the Btetaf How small "the
prejudices of childhood look to you when you stand on the eminence of
manhood. The fact is there is no height reached along any line of life or
work that lifts us up above the narrow limit- of a narrow life that doe
not show us peak after peak to climb before we can reach the point above
tbe clouds which continually rests serene and lovely ia the pnrest atmos
phere of eternal sunshine.
Will it unsex a woman to vote for candidates for office who will make
laws that will restore prosperity to the country and so make it possib'e
for her to support herself and family^ Wiii it unsex a woman to vote for
the amendment tbat will remove the mortgage tax and so decrease the in
terest sbe pays? I can see no dividing line between work and making;
laws that govern the prosperity ci labor. If it will unsex % woman to
vote one day in the year on these questions it surely will unsex her to
work every day in the year, and for fear of this dreadful calamity befalling
the Nation should not a law be passed prohibiting women from working
and compelling men to renew their efforts so that they can support aii
women without their being obliged to workVnd so endanger their woman
hood?
Some women say, "We don't want the ballot given to women Decaus* it
may bring dissension in some homes." It may bring more dissension in
the homes where the husband or wife now rules as a tyrant; bat should
tbe ballot be withheld from all women because the women in such homes
will then have tue same right as such men? It would be just aa absurd,
for the same cause, to take the right of tbe ballot from all men.
There have been no great reforms in the history of tbe world than
have not caused the sacrifice of some of tbe noblest mea and women of
the times. And it would be a glory to any nation thai would sacrifice the
least worthy of its citizens, for the sake of giving justice to half us pÂ«oplÂ«.
Men of California, the women of this State who are the most active in
the reforms stand before you, beseeching you to tike from their arms the
fetters that hok* them from making the moral influence ot womÂ«m a
power in this State. Are you competent to act as jurors to dacuie tbis
question? Have you listened to the evidence with unbiased minds?
Have not many of you dozed in your chairs and not even heard the evi
dence?
Of all the charges you have made to still exclude women from the
rights of the ballot, there is but one mat is true; every other charge baa
been proved false. Even your own hearts must cry out "not guilty," tor
day after day yonrliTes echo those wordi from mountain top to sea, for
the greatest treasures you have are your children, and yon leave them ia. ,
the keeping of the women in your homes and in the schools.
The women of this State plead "guilty" to only one chars*, "yoa are
women." '"Yes," they say, "we are women and are guilty of this charge, and
we must be received as women into the ranks of voters; for womanhood
is inherent in our nature and is a divine gift, and no giving or withhold
ing of any man-made rights will ever change a woman's distinctive quali
ties." The mothers turn their faces proudly toward heaven and say,
"Yes, guilty :â  of being women, but, thank God, we have been deemed
worthy to cradle in our arms many a loved son." '
Listen to the charge of the Judge, the constitution of California:
Ali men are br nature free and independent, and have certain inalienable
right*, araon? wDleh are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty and
pursuing and obtaining safety and happineu. â¢. - *.. - , â

Gordon C. Bettles, who runs trading I
Â»osts at Nulatto, Tanana and Arctic City,'
n the YuKon country (the latter post
Â»eing in latitude 64 deg. 36 roin., is half of
t decree inside the Arctic Circle), is here,
md he tells of remarkable adventures with
noose, bighorn sheep and other animals.
Mr. Bettles captured and reared Jerry, the
big moose in Golden Gate Park, and sent
bin: here. He also sent a mate for Jerry,
but it died on the way. He has tamed
md worked moose in teams, and says they
ire in ail respects remarkable animals.
â¢'I raised Jerry and had him and nis
mate broke to harness," he sad yester
day. "A moose has got the greatest sense
of any animal in the world. When wild
they can smell a man at an enormous dis
tanc , like a wild horse, and can see and
hear further than any other animal of
which i ever heard. When they are
tamed they are as tractable as a dog, and
will do anythingâ come when you call
them, lie down and roll over. I had a big
moose, that would weig^h 1000 pounds,
come right into the cabin with me.
â¢â¢The rcoose would do this with me, or
anybody they knew, but not with a
stranger. With them they are treach
erous, and will kick, strike or use their
horns in a second.
"The moose up at the post of Tanana
are very numerous, and on the snow they
are much faster than a horse. Their legs
are so long they step right over a log four
feet hig'u and go right along. .Logs that a
man would have to climb over do not
bother them at all.
"I bave seen as many as fifteen moose
together there. I have seen them in win
ter in their corral. A moose corral is a
peculiar thing. The moose make it by
tramping around and around on the
snow, the big ones ahead and the little
ones behind. In this way they get down
to the willows and weeds, and there they
feed. I have seen them beat down tne
snow in this way till there was a round
wall of snow six or seven feet high about
them.
"When the willows and weeds are
eaten out the big moose lunge out, and
the little ones follow. The big ones break
the willows and gouge out the snow with
their horns. When they get out of one
corral they make another. The moose
work their lips like a horse.
"I have been on a two weeks' hunt for
moose while the thermometer was from
sixty-five to seventy degrees below zero
all the time. I had three dog teams, with
seven does in a team, and two natives to
each. Two of the teams were to haul
meat for the dogs and provisions for me,
and the other team was to haul me when
I got tired walking.

between camps. It was over a flat country
and through brush. One native went

color reoresents a sound, what divine
anthems these aristocrats of the mineral
world must sing â what melodies and har
monies to touch the soul of nature!
Two important lessons, it seems to me,
are offered to man â the bully and the
monarch of this little earthâ by these
crystalline brothers of the metals, and
they are "accuracy" and "harmony.''
There are some curious legends con
nected with gems. There always has been
and probably always will be something
about them which makes them precious
other than the value arising from ti e
labor of obtaining, and their relative
scarcity. Whether it be superstition or
truth, there ia a common belief in the
minds of men, and has been from time
immemorial, that gems have exercised
a specific power upon the human organ
ism. It is well known that among other
minerals precious stones â at least some
of them â are possessed of an influence
which is analagous to electricity ana mag
netism, if, indeed, it is not really these
forces themselves that contribute the in
naie virtues to inanimate ( ?) crystals.
But are they inanimate? What is life?
It has been stated more than once re
cently that everything is alive, down to
the very atoms floating in the air, and in
making this statement nothing new is of
fered, as we find the same belief incor
porated in the views of the ancients. In
fact, it was proclaimed and believed in
Eeypt, that land of pyramids, sphinx and
other mysteries. Even in our own day
the greatest scientific minds have come to
the conclusion that life is a universal,
omnipresent principle. Nothing, let me
say, is without life. In seme forms, as
stones, life acts slowly, but nonetheless
truly. This is a queer tenet, no doubt, to
modern minds, but we rind it beine em-
I braced by many intelligent people, and it
I is worth mentioning here as offering pos-
I sibly a clew to tie action of stones and
f meials when used therapeutically.
In some frai ments of ancient lore we
find the statement that it was imagined
tnat the garnet was conducive to joy, the
chalcedony to couraee, the topaz promot
ing chastity, the amethyst assisting rea
son, and the sapphire intuition, showing 1

are we used boots of sealskin and walrus

country, covered with low brush and moss
in summer and being wet and swampy.
We had to be careful in our advances on
thereby an action upon the mental sphere
of man, as well as upon his physical
organism.
It is the dream of science that every
thing in the universe has originated from
one primordial substance, which not
many years ago v;as claimed to be carbon.
Whatever it is this primordial substance
has been differentiated into incalculable
species of matter, and everything is des
tined to return thereinto. Among others
Mesmer claimed that the secret of healing
lies in the knowledge of correspondencies
and affinities between kindred atoms.
Find the metal, stone or plant that has |
the most correspondential affinity with
the body of the sufferer, and, whether
through internal or external use, that par
ticular agent, imparting to the patient ad
ditional strength to fight disease and to
expel it, will lead invariably to his cure.
Gems are used in this way because of
the results to be obtained from the molec
ular motion of the crystals, but more
often their influence is of a more subtle
nature, acting on the subjective plane, I
causing emotions or sensations because of
vibrations set up in the mental sphere
through the color of the peculiar stone
used or the idiosyncrasies of the subject.
It will be remembered by the careful ;
reader of some ten years ago what a sen
sation was caused throughout the think
ing world by the researches of General
Pleasanton upon the benefit to be derived
from utilizing the color blue, which sug
gests the sapphire stone. The marked re
spect paid by the Buddhists to this stone
(the sapphire), which was sacred to Luna
; in all other countries, may be found based
| upon something more scientifically exact
than a mere groundless superstition.
"They ascribed to it a sacred magical
j power, which every student of psychologi
cal mesmerism will readily understand,
for its polished and deep-blue surtace pro
! duces extraordinary somnambulistic
phenomena.
'Tne varied influence of the prismatic
colors on the growth of vegetation, and
especially that of the 'blue ray,' has been
recognized by science. The academicians
quarreled over the unequal heating power
| of the prismatic rays until a series of ex
perimental demonstrations by General
Fleasanton proved that under the b ue
ray, the most electric of all, animal and
vegetable erowth was increased to a magi
cal proportion. Thus Amoretti's investi
gationa of tne electric polarity of precious
stoneÃshow that the diamond, the gar
net, the amethyst are minus E, while the
sapphire is plus E. Thus it will be seen that
what science has recently discovered was
known to the Hindu saees before any of
the modern academies were founded."
There is an old Hindu legend that
Brahma, repenting bi terly for a certain
sin committed, in his grief dropped a tear
on earth, tbe hottest that ever fell from
an eye, and from this was formed the first
sapphire.
The Buddhists assert that the sapphire
produces peace of mind, equanimity, and
chases away all evil thoughts by establish
ing a healthful circulation in man.
Among a few curious fragments we find
some interesting matter bearing upon the
use and bupposed virtues of precious
t tones; we give them for what they are
worth.

sense of smell.
"At the foot of Arctic City, which is a half
degree inside the Arctic Circle and on the
Koukuk River, I once visited with thirty
miners'. There are moose there in plenty
and it is tne home of mountain sheep and
goats., I killed seven moose within five
miles of the post and there were thirty
seven moose killed there that winter.
â¢'T c sheep were the bighorn sheep and
they were very fine eating. Take them in
September, when they are in good condi
tion, and I know of nothing finer. By the
way, I brought down two heads of the
sheep with me.
"But, alluding again to the moose, Mc-
Questin, who has the post at Forty Mile,
had two moose which he broke to harness,
and with them he used to haul freight and
plow his garden. They weighed over 1000
pounds each. I used some moose I had
in this way to plow n potato patch at
Tanana. The Jeet of the moosÂ© are very
â  big. They spread out like a cow's hoof,
1 and there are a couple of bie deerclaws
the ruby; Sagittarius, the carbuncle.
They are the first, the third and tbe fifth
of the same card, and when worn prop
erly augment the power of the wearer by
adding strength to his or her vibrations.
It is a scientific fact."
Birth stones and natal flowers are given
by some "authorities," and the list has
been frequently published.
Pliny remarks that the diamond is the
companion of gold and seems only to be
produced from gold, for all ihe diamond
mines bave been brought to light in pur
suit of alluvial gold wasbing. The
medieval Italians believed a diamond
maintained concord between husband and
wife.
Tbe blue diamond combines the azure
of tbe sapphire with its own adamantine
luster and becomes "most lovely" by the
addition. The rose-colored far eclipses
the ruby, as does the green the emerald.
Where any of these three tints is decided,
but especially the ereen. it enormously
augments the commercial value of the
stone.
- An infallible test to distinguish the ruby
from the garnet is to bold each so as to
reflect the light directly. The garnet,
however pure and lustrous, will appear
black and opaque, while the ruby retains
its transparency and true color. Both
these stones are notable for great electrical
qualities; the ; arnet negative and the
ruby positive. The , true Oriental ruby
presages to the wearer by the frequent
change and darkening of its color that
, some inevitable loss or misfortune is at
band ; and, in proportion to the greatness
of the coming evil, does it assume a
greater or less degree of darkness or
opacity.
According to Levi, the seven kabbalistic
precious stones are carbuncles, crystals,
diamonds, emeralds, agates, sapphires and
onyx. Y-/1 â -\

Libraries irv America.
The Englishman, it is said, is not a book
buyer but a book borrower, says the Lon
non Times. In America the reverse has
hitherto been the case. There have been
few facilities for borrowing books, at least
books which people want to read, and so
genuine booksellers have been a necessity.
Why circulating libraries have not long
ago made headway in New York or Bos
ton is not altogether clear. Probably the
cheapness of reprinted novels (combined
with the natural spending proclivities of
Americans) militates against their
chances. In England when all novels
were issued in three-volume form it was
practically impossible to read them except
by the aid of Mudie's; but in proportion
as the price of a book is lowered the func
tion of a circulating library disappears.
In America there were not enough copy
right novels to support the three-volume
system prior to tbe international act of
1891, and now that the system Is being dis
carded here it is hardly likely to make
fresh headway in the United States. For
a circulating library to be successful its
subscribers niu-t live within a certain
radius; otherwise the cost of carriage
makes the process of exchanging books
too expensive, in America the distances
are so vast that Mv lie's library could
never have served the whole country.
They must have established branches in
all the great centers of population, and the
expense and time occupied in keeping
their depots supplied and organized wouid
have made the business unprofitable.
Some idea of the difficulty even now of
supplying books in large quantities to the
far-off Western States may be formed from
the fact that it is not uncommon for New
York publishers to send consignments to
the Pacific Coast round Cape Horn and
that it is usual to allow a month or six
weeks for transit by freight trains to the
same destination.
During the last few years, however, the
gap caused by the absence of circulating
libraries has begun to be filled by tbe
public libraries which have sprung into
existence in nearly every large city. At the
present there are over 500 of the public
libraries which are regarded as standing
sufficiently high to be entitled to gratu
itous copies of all the United States
Government publications, and tbe num
ber is constantly increasing. Most of
these libraries bave a reference depart
ment and a lending department.
But the lending departments are much
more enterprising and up-to-date than
those of similar English institutions-
They lay tbemselves out to meet the re.
quirements of the citizens. When a new
book is in demand it is not considered a
sufficient answer to reply that it is "out"
and leave you to solace yourself with one
of the old masters. The American libra
rian considers it his duty to supply
enough copies to give reasonable satisfac
tion to his clients. For instance, one
liorarian informed us that be had bought
thirty copies of "Trilby," sixteen or seven
teen of "Marcella," and so on. Of how
many English libraries could this be said?

Make Your OWrv Buttermilk
An ingenious housekeeper has hit upon
a novel way of procuring delicious butter
milk without tbe labor of churning. Ac
cording to the Atlanta Constitution the
milk in permitted to sour and partially
skimmed so as to allow enough cream to
render it rich. It can be taken from the
icebox, provided you wish it cold, and
simply beat it a few moments with an egg
beater (one that turns with a handle is
preferable), and you have as fine butter
milk as can be made under any process.
There are so many invalids that crave it,
and yet it is often an impossibility to get
it pure and rich. It is usually diluted with
water, and often there are so many lumps
of butter floating through it that it is not
very inviting, but by this mode any one
who can get any amount of milk, no mat
ter how small, can manufacture in a few
moments a drink fit for the gods. Try it
and see how quickly this delightful drink
can be had.
Some idea of the vast extent of the sur
face of the earth may be obtained when it
is noted that if a lofty church steeple is
ascended and the landscape visible from
it looked at, 900,000 such landscapes must
be viewed in order that the whole earth
may be seen.
THIS MAN LIVES ON 87 1-2 CENTS A WEEK.
REFORM DIET OF A PREACHER
EscheWs Fisk, FlesK ar\d FoWl ar\d
Li\tes or\ 872 Gerxts a Week
If all men were like the Rev. Miles
Grant of Boston the question of economics
would be quickly solved, for he knows
how to live- on 81)4 cents a week.
Rev. Mr. Grant makes one of those
peculiar combinations of fact and theory
that are rarely found. He invariably
practices what he preaches, in practice
he is a vegetarian ; in theory he is one of
that interesting sect known as the Ad
ventists.
The question of diet has been decided
by him after profound study. The correct
idea he believes to be based on four prin
ciples. They are as follows:
1. Eat, healthy food.
2. Consume a healthy quantity of food.
3. Eat in a healthy manner.
4. Eat at healt!-- times.
Of course the fi t question that arises
Tl^e Snows of Shasta
Across the fields all gray and bare,
The foothills rise in ranks of blue,
And through the shadows here and there
'Are flecks of clearer brighter hue â
The sunset's glow.
The lower hills in shadow rest,
The higher peer above the gloom,
To where, against her shining crest,
The last beams cast the faintest bloom
On Shasta's snow.
In calmest dignity she stands,
While darkness gathers round her base,
And shadows climb with clutching hands,
And clouds approach in billowing race
As wild winds blow.
The winds will wrestle all the night,
And hurl the clouds against her side ;
The storm will beat and spend its might,
In effort strong to quell the pride
Of Shasta's snow.
Yet, in to-morrow's cloudless day,
Her stately head with snowy crown
Will sparkle in the sun's first ray,
And mists will chase the shadows down
To vales below.
Through ages gone the storm has sought
To move, to crush that stately form ;
But still she stands and yields to naught,
And gathers whiteness from the storm
For Shasta's snow.
If we, who bear the storms of life,
Could calmly patient wait the day,
Could bear the beat of toil and strife,
And never falter on our way
O'er paths of woe,
The light would come, the sun would rise,
And we would stand all strong and sure,
Eternal sunshine in our eyes,
Our doubts at rest, our souls as pure
As Shasta's snow.
Mary c. Bantz.
is how to correctly interpret these princi
ples. Healthy food, according to Mr.
Grant, is included in the following lis; of
eatables: Unleavened bread, made of
graham meal; porridge made of oatmeal;
beans, peas and the various kinds of
fruits, including figs and dates; English
walnuts; mild, new cheese; raw eggs in
milk. The bread is made by stirring gra
ham meal and cold water till the com
bination is about thick enough for griddie
cakes, and it is then baked in castiron
gem pans.
Theso articles are never permitted to
pass Mr. Grant's lips: Flesh, fish and
fowj, pies, cakes, tea, coffee, sugar, salt,
ginger, mustard, pepper and all spices.
Iv short, this dietarian uses no seasoning
in any food, unless a little milk can be
considered to come within that category.
The unleavened bread is placed at the
front of all healthful food, on which, the
doctor declares, he lives well at a cost of
87 }4 cents a week. There are no other two
things, be alleges, which will enable one
to accomplish so much work, either men
tal or physical, as will this bread and oat
meal porridge, the latter made after the
iashion of hasty pudding.
What a blow it would be to the restau
rant and hotel keepers if Mr. Grant could
convert even a respectable number of
persons to his theory. Think of a hotel
menu tbe choicest article of which would
be unleavened bread. Even the Arab,
abstemious as he is, could never be in
duced to indorse Mr. Grant's theory â that
87}4 cents a week proposition â because to
bar salt would be to deprive him of the
right of exercising the most cherished fea
ture of his code of hospitality.
Again, his theory, even if we can live on
Sl}4 cents a week by following it, over
turns one of the oldest medical theories â
that without salt we will gradually pine
away until death claims us for his own.
Just how much can we eat on an 87J^
cents a week basis? Dr. Grant says we
can get al! we need, all that we ought to
consume, if we wish to maintain our
health at the proper standard. He tells
exactly what to do in these words:
"In relation to the 'healthy quantity'
of food I became satisfied that most
people ate too much. When I came to
decide on the quantity that my system
needed I first let my appetite decide; but
it soon occurred to my mind that my ap
petite had neifher reason nor judgment,
and therefore was not competent to direct
in the matter. I'he late Dr. Dio Lewis of
Boston gave me a very valuable rule on
this subject, which was to decide on the
quantity before a mouthful is taken.
After weighing and measuring my food
and noting the effect upon my stomach I
arrived at the quautity and quality of
food adapted to a healthy system. I
found that when I followed that my
stomach made no more complaint about
its work than did my eyes when seeing,
ears when hearing or heart and lungs
when breathing. I have not had the sick
headache once in forty-five years.
"Concerning the 'manner of eat : ng,' I
soon found that fast eating was a common,
bad habit of the American people, and
one special cause of indigestion. I had
been in the habit of eating a meal in five
or ten minutes. Instead of moistening
my food with saliva, I washed it down
with tea and coffee. My rule is, not to eat
a meal in less than half an hour, but I am
usually much longer. All the food should
be converted into a complete pulp in the
mouth before it enters the stomach. I
drink nothing when eating.
"As to 'the times of eating' : In my early
life I ate whenever I felt an appetite for
food, which might be a dozen times a day.
I became satisfied that this habit would
lead to the ruin of health. For thirty-five
years I have eaten but tvio meals a day
and nothing between meals. I take break
fast at 8 o'clock and dinner at 3 o'clock. I
have no desire for food except at these
hours.
"As I grow older, I feel younger. I can
preach every evening, and three times
Sunday, and feel as fresh at the close of
the day as in tLie morning."
While Mr. Grant's idea may not meet
witn approval from those of us who are
lovers of the fleshpots of Egypt, there is
plenty of medical indorsement to prove
the truth of his assertions.
It is an acsolute solution of the prob
lem how to livo cheaply and well. We
have all heard of peop o who could live on
$1 5U per week, but that was only by stint
ing the supply and forcing the system to
get along witu less nourishment than was
needed. Here is a p!an that aids health
and helps us to get rich.
The only drawback that might weigh
seriously against Mr. Grant's pian would
be that which the unmarried man could
advance. How is he going to procure the
prescribed food prepared in the proper
manner? Restaurants do not have food
of this sort.
So the only way for the single man to
live on 87J^ cents a w ek, is io get married
jor learn to prepare his own food. It is a
great question. The new woman, if she*
can cook, will find in this problem another
to add to the many advances she haa
I already received over sufierinc man.

8IBN THE WORLD OF SOCIETY-
Preparing for the Opening of the Season
Teas in Honor of a Debutante and a Bride
The Homer King Dinner-Theater Parties
POLITICS has left its impress on society
with the result that the season is lateâ
unusually lateâ this year.
Entertainments are not alone for the fairer
sex, and the menâ well, it is useless to ask
them during the exciting finish of a hard
fought campaign. Once McKinley elected
every one looks forward to a brightening of
the social horizon and an active social season.
Another reason advanced by the social leaders
for tbe lateness of the season is tbe fact that
Lent comes very late this year and conse
quently a hastening of the season would un
necessarily prolong the period of social fes
tivities.
The launching of the debutante is always an
important event, and wheu the young lady is
pretty, winsome and fetching and of unques
tioned social standing, as is the case of Miss
Carol Crockett, the affair is deserving of
more than passing interest.
Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Crockett selected to in
troduce their daughter to their many friends
at a tea given at their California-street resi
dence yesterday afternoon, between the hours
of 4 and 7. Tbe entire lower floor of the
Crockett houpe was placed at the disposal of
the many guests.
No elaborate attempt at decoration was
made. There were flowers everywhere â no
set arrangementâ and autumn blossoms, of
course, prevailing. Yellow chrysanthemums |
were the favored flowers, and they nodded j
their fluffy golden heads from tnll delicate !
vases, crystal bowls aud the many other re- J
ceptacles fashion decrees for the use of flowers.
Mrs. and Miss Crockett received their friends
assisted by Misses Frances and Miriam Moore,
the Mistes Genevieve and Aiieeu GoÂ»d, the
Misses May and Alice Hoffman, Miss Carrie
Taylor, Miss Cora Sraedberg, Miss Helen Hop
kins, Miss Geuevieve Carolau and Miss Kaie
Salisbury.
In the evening the young ladles of the re
ceiving party and a corresponding number of
gentlemen were entertained by Mr. and Mrs.
Crockett at dinner.
Mrs. George 0. Boar<lman gave a tea compli
mentary to her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Chaun
cey Boardmau nee Mercado, yesterday after
soon from 4 to 7.
The reception-room, library and dining hall
of the handsome Boardman residence were
aglow with beautiful yellow chrysanthemums,
while the reception-room boasted of a dei.caie
decoration of pink and while roses. Mrs.
George C. Boaidman and Mrs. Chauucey Board
man received their guests, assisted by Miss
Margaret Salisbury, Miss Kate Sulisbury, Miss
Juliette Tompklns, Miss Clementina Kip, Miss
Hager, Miss Cora Smedberg, Miss Mary Bell
Gwin, Miss Eliel Tompkins. Miss Juliette \Ml
liems, Mit>s Ethel Rogers, Miss Mary Kip, the
Misses Bertha and Helen Smith, Miss Louisa
Breeze, Miss Isabel McKenna, Miss Ronne Wal
lace, Miss Bessie Bowie, Miss May Friedlander,
Hiss Mamie McMuilin and Miss Sawyer.
Miss May Hoffman gave a theater potty at
the Baldwin last Monday evening, which was I
followed by a supper at the University Clud. |
Her guests were: Mrs. Southard Hoffman, Mi-s j
Helen Hopk.ns, Miss Carol Crockett. Miss
Miriam Moore, Miss Frances Moore. Miss Ger

ward M. Greenway, Gerald Rathbone, Harry
Poett, Andr j w Manin, Lawrence Van Winkle,
Thomas Berry, Latham McMuilin, William li.
Tavlor Jr. and Southard Hoffman Jr.
Mr. and Mrs. Homer S. King gave a dinner
party last Wednesday evening at their resi
dence, 1001 Leavenworth street, in honor of !
Mr. and Mrs. George Crocker. The others ]
present were: Mrs. Henry Wetherbee, Mrs.
George ti. Roe, Mrs. Frances B. Edgerton and
Frank Lincoln. During the evening the latter
entertained the company with several of his
humorous sketches.
Allan St. John Bowie gave a theater party et
the Baldwin last Monday evening. His guests
were Mrs. Jessie Detrick, Miss Emelie Hager.
Miss Aileen Goad, K'lward H.Sheldon, Cuarles
K. Mclntosh, Dr. Robert 1. Bowie and Claude
T. Hamilton.
Major John A. Darling, V. S. A., has ob
tained the long leave of tb-enee he asked for,
which will continue until next June, when he
will retire. He and Mrs. Darling will pass sev
eral weeks at their country place, alter which
they will go to the Hawaiian Islands, Japan
and China. Major aud Mrs. i;arl!ng v.ill be at
the Occidental Hotel a fortnight before their
departure, which will be about the last week
of- December. Miss Hastings and her com
panion wiil be with Mrs. Darling.
Horace Annesley Vachell, the distinguished
London author of California stories, is being
entertained by Mr. and Mrs. Rounsevelle WiM
xnan for a few days.
WEDDING BELLS.
J. H. Crossett Weds an Eastern
Belle.
A VERY pretty home wedding took place
on Wednesday, September 30, at the res
idence of H. B. Thornton, manager of
the Western Union Telegraph Company,
â Winona, Minn. His daughter, Miss Hattie L.
Thornton, was wedded to James H. Crosett,
son of James F. Crosett of this City. The
young couple will spend the winter in tue East.

CLUB PARTIES.
Prominent Social Organizations
Entertain Their Friends.
ON Wednesday evening the Good Samari
tan Social Club gave its scmi-annuai
supper and reception In the club lecture
and entertainment room, at 249 Second street.
The festive board, which was shaped like a
horseshoe, was tastefully decorated with au
tumnal fruits and flowers.
President T. C.West opened the entertain
ment with an exhaustive review of the insti
tution and was followed by Vice-President T.
H. Mothias in an earnest appcnl to the mem
bers for the broadening of the wort. The
Right Rev. W. Ford Nichols, Bishop of Cali
fornia, then made an eloquent address, in the
course of which he illustrated by anecdote the
necessity oi energetic action in ihe further
ance of any good cause.
Key. W. Ingraham Kip spoke on the more
commodious quarters which is to be the home
of the club, and which, in connection with the
new mission, will soon be in course of con
struction. Songs, stories and recitations were
interlarded throughout the e\> â â ;, iig, and at the
close the entire assemblage Âii-.. i in "Auld
Lane Syne." Those present ivert:
I Right Rev. W. F. Nichols, Rev. W. I. Kip, T.
' Mr. George L. Bunn recognized as one of the. i
leading whist-players living, ana one of the
committee oi experts to report at the seventh
, congress a system of piny, says, in a recent
article to the St. Paul Globe:
.The ' call for. trumps is a ' valuable weapon,
but it should be used with judgment. The
idea that a player roust display his knowledge
of /this simple artifice just because he hap
pens to , hold great trump strength should
be abandoned by those who. hope ever to
play a good game of whist. One very frequent j
situation where a call ought not to be made, j
yet often is, is where the trump hand's part- j
ncr opens with the ace of a plain suit, and
the trump hand has two smail cards of that
suit,' and no suit of his; own that requires
trump exhausting. In these cases, if the leader
follows with a king, the call must be com
pleted and the leader must respond at once,
probably leaving his suit unestabljuhed and
rendering the making of the small cards of it
impossible without the presence of two cards
of re-entry, whereas by continuing the suit for
a third round it will be established and but
one re-entry cardfts needed , to bring it Â°in if
partner can exhaust the trumps. The follow
ing deal, played in a practice game last week,
illustrates our argument: '

tnem in, as he has but one card of re-entry.
Letter From the President of the
WheelocU Club, Portland.
To the Whitt Editor of the Call: I have been
reading an article by "Cavendish" in Scrlb
ner's for November on "WhaÂ» America Has
Done for Whist," and I beg to call your atten
tion to one of the statements made * therein.
He gives all honor to N. B. Trist;of New Or
leans for the perfect system of play known and
embodied us the American lead, which was
originated by Mr. Trist in 1883. He. goes on
in detail to explain the system of the original i
lead ;of a ; high card, and > the ! proper follow
from two indifferent high cards to show num
ber; the lead of high card and the follow of a
low card, etc., showing how the rule of play
has been formulated with a principle contain
ing the element p.' simplicity. "
V; Then ihe comes to ; the : lead ?of a low card,
saying it was formerly the practice to lead the
lowest if a long suit. Then followed the lead
of the penultimate from a suit of five or more,
which Drayson improved upon by the lead of
the antepenultimate from a suit of . six.
Cavendish states further that the principle of ,
leading fourth' best was r "struck simultan
eously" by himself and : Mr.' Trist, their letters â¢
crossing on the Atlantic.

The OU-t.i Club gr.ve its eleventh anni
versary and souvenir ball at Odd Fellows'
Hall on Saturday evening, October 31. Each
In 18(50 General A. W. Dravsan adopted the
lead of the penultimate from tive and the ante
penuiiimaie irom six. Thirteen years later,
in the "Art of Practical Wliist," he called at
tention to this lead. Cavendish, in reviewing
his woik iv the Field, slated this innovation
Is not likely to be of any value. A few years
after Cevendish announced in the Field that
this lead of the fourth best was one of the
greatest advances in whist during many years,
and forgot to mention Mojor-General Dray
son's name in connection with its origin.
Trist, in 1884 or 1885. simplified the ex
pression from "penultimate" and â¢â¢ante
penultimate^' to "fourth best." We cannot
give too ereat honor to Mr. Trist for his won
derful system of leads and for the knowledge
he has given to us through his scientific study
and research ; but a spiri: of justice to Gen
eral Draywn demands that attention be
called to him as the originator of the now
called fourth-best lead.
May I, in this connection, state that three
other fine plays were first brought to notice
by General Drayson, viz.: The "change of
suit" and "reverse discard," which are looked
upon liy many expert p.ayers as most Impor
tant innovations and without doubt trick
winners; and the now quite common irregu
lar lead, as a signal for trumps through an
honor turned, which is by many considered a
comparatively recent invention, but which
was siiÃgt-sted by Drayson In 1870, as was
stated in The Call a f^w weeks ago.
With all due respect for "Cavendish" and a
keen appreciation of the many good things
contained in the article above-mentioned, but
with a spirit of Justice to al!, I modestly sub
mit this article for your consideration. Very
respectiully, L. W. feino.v.

equaled activity and interost. We propose to
meet the demand for daily whist literature by
chronicling i" this department the doings of
the fraternity of whisters from the home ot
A. W. L. President Barney, in New England,
to the native town of Director Tormey, by thd
far Pacific.
While the occurrences of interest that take
place in this city will be given the full recog
nition awarded them in former years, the cir- ,
culation of this department in every part of
the country demands that it be National
rather than local In its character. We pro
pose to furnish the whisters of the United
States with a whist daily, which will give
them the latest news and comment of general
interest.
Among the features of this department may
be enumerated:
Special accounts of the A. W. L. trophy
matches.
Prompt report of all games of importance.
Thorough and scientific discussion of every
new play.
Clear and distinct explanations for begin
ners.
A reproduction with comment of match
deals, showing expert play.
Every whist reader on this coast that lores
the game can have a daily column of this
scientific game from the pen of one of the
whist giunts of this country. Mr. Work, by
the way, m one of the term of four that wop

There Is very pretty play here all through ia
lend and follow, ana shows that the players
understood how to enjoy fine whist. No com
mou player could do such work as is shown in
this nan i. Winning the game is nothing:â
that could be done in o.her ways â but the
quality of the play is everything. Everyman
at the tible read every card in hand upon the
clay of the tenth trick. This is thÂ«whistl
want you to play In San Francisco.
The play in this deal was to win the odd
trick. Had North opened with the two of
spaaes, instead of making the "Deschappelles
lead,' ' lie would bare lost the gaaae.
FROM GREATER NEW YORK
A Budget of Interesting J^leWs ar\d Qossip
About the California Goloruj ir\ the
Eastern Metropolis.
NEW YORK. N. V.. Oct. 24.â What a
boon independence is, after all! It's a
funny fact, but a man never seems so over
bearing, never exhibits more sublime arro
gance and tgntism than he does just four
days before a Presidential election.
The most dumb and retiring dispositions
b come warmed to the very lever heat of
enthusiasm when "party" or "candidate"
is made the subject for argument.
Who can blame the wage-earner, the tax
payer, the long-suffering private citizen
for expressing his independent views in
strident tones at every opportunity offered ?
He doesn't have the privilege very often;
besides, to-day he is an important and in
dispenEflbie factor in this mighty Govern
ment's affairs, for be has ft vote to cast.
In a few more days he may find he is not
bo popular or important as he fancied.
When a Californian determines to seek
new lands to conquer he either takes pas
s age to South America or Africa, where
pioneering appeals to bis Western spirit,
or he quietly and meekly enters one of the
great Eastern cities, where before many
moons hove shea mesmeric beams on tha
dull world he makes himself known by
bis genius, talents and individuality.
The worid at large soon joins the great
city in applauding his merits, and the
ambitious Caliiornian rejoices to know he
is famous. At present there are a score of
Californians who are basking in the smiles
of a generous New York public.
Al Hayman, genial, dignified and smil
ingly seitipn always, is managing one of
the handsomest theaters in New York,
the Knickerbocker, and his popular
brother, Harry Maun, is a general over
seer of the different theaters and com
panies in which Mr. Hayman is inter
ested.
Down at Hoyt's Madison-eauare Theater
Archibald Clavering Gunter is busily en
gaged weeding out all the objectionable
things in his new comedy, "A Florida En
chantment." The newspapers were very
6urt and bitter in their criticisms of the
play when it opened, but the public like
the ludicrous side of the unique story,
and in consequence Hoyt's cozy little the
ater is filled every night. So successful
has the play been that the manager,
James E. Moore, has extended the run to
sixteen weeks. At the end of that time
the comedy and original company will
tour the interior States.
Over at the Academy of Music Clay M.
Greene arid David Belasco's melodrama,
"Under the Polar Star," is closing a pros
perous season of ten weeks. Ciay M. Greene
has an idea! home over at Bayside on
Long Isiaad, where he and nis charming
wife entertain old friends from California
and welcome cordially the new-found
friends of the East.
Ben Teal bas been on the high wave of
success during the past year, and every
moment of bis time is occupied now in
writing, producing and managing clays.
William A. Brady no longer advertises
himself as ''the manager of Jim Corbett,"
having decided that the time was ripe for
diopping that questionable dignity. Air.
Brady's ambition to be recognized among
the prominent mana ers of the United
States i 3 evidenced by the superior casts
he is giving his productions. This season '
he has in his employ some of the most
prominent people in tbe theatrical pro
fession. There is a plucky little Califor
nian here who has made a name ami fame
for herself by the fcarctest of study and
the most tenacious perseverance. Her
name is Ida Benfey, and her school days
were passed in San Jose. As a reader and
elocutionist she bas won extraordinary
success.
i called ou her atiier pretty apartments
in the Carnegie b/ilaing isst Thursday,
and found her radiant with health and
courage. Just a week ago &he returned
from a jaunt in tbe Adirondacks, where
sh- bad to go, after her three months'
season in London, to rest and recuperate.
Last April Miss Benfey went over to Eng
land for the lirst time. Her purpose in
going was to give readings and recitations
during the London season. She met with
immediate success and remained, iv Lon
don until the end of July. One of the
most pleasant incidents, of her visit, she
declares, was the reception to "Women
Journalists," given at the Duke of Suther
land's home, Stafford House. Many of
the most prominent folk in England were
in attendance. Among iberu were: Mr.
Balfour, Lord Rcsebery, Mr. Zangwill,
Sarah Graud, Anthony Hope, Richard H.
Hutton and J. W. Cross, "George Eliot's"
husband. Miss Benfey will go over again
next April.
Theodore Wores is a transplanted Cali
fornian, and an artist whose peculiar tal
ent for painting Japanese and Chinese
pictur s has made him fatuous. His studio
in tbe Carnegie building is hung with
handsome Chinese ai>d Japanese embroid
eries, portieres and oriental bric-a-brac,
making a suitable background for bis
wonderful paintings of Japanese life. Mr.
Wores has recpntly finished a picture
which he calls "Jiso Boma," It represents
a beautiful yÂ«ung Japanese mother burn
ing incense be. ore the patron saint of little
children. The ti ure is in profile, and the
yellow glow from the burning incense
throws a mystic light over the bronze
image of Jiso Soma and across the round,
youthful cheeks of the sad-eyed mother!
Tbe coloring is exquisite and one of the
best things Wores has don i in that line.
He has been giving tUe greater part of his
time during the past year to portrait
painting.
In January he intends to start for
Japan, where he will remain about a year.
He will pass a couple of weeks in Sau
Francisco before sailing.

BTJRNETTE G. HASKFLL'S WORDS
. Pceamble and Resolutions Drawn and
Vouched For by This We.l-
Known Agitator.
At a recent meeting of the County Ex
ecutive Committee of the People's party
in the City and County of San Francisco a
long-winded preamble, with a lot of
whereases, was adopted, setting forth
that they believed that coercion is to be
exercised or election day for the purpose
of gainine votes for Major McKinley, the
Republican nominee for President. A
copy of the document was sent to The
Call, and because of its remarkable con
tents tue matter was considered worthy of
an investigation.
The accusation specifically mentioned
the Southern Pacific Company and the
Market-street Railway Company, and in
order to give it a grand sweep â sufficient
to encompass the carth â the words "and
. other corporations" were added.
The manner in which this alleged pro
posed coercion is to be carried out, ac
cording to the Populistic idea, is an old
scbemeâ a chestnut, in factâ and has been
talked of before every election tnat has oo
â¢ curbed since the adoption of the Austra
lian ballot system, but never heard of
after the votes are counted. The idea may
.be clearly explained by quoting the words
' of the preanihle:
Whereas, We are informed and believe that
these corporations have instructed their em
ployes that they must vote for McKinley, mo
nopoly and millionairism, and have with
devilish ingenuity notified each man that he
must, in order to show that lie has carried out
. the instruction of nis slavemaster, write in his
â¢ own handwriting UDon the bailot that he shall
cast at the next election his own or some other
name ior some office, thus showing: exactly
how he votsd, this in violation of the secrecy
of the ballot; and whereas, we regard this as
the most infamous attack yet made upon the
fundamental liberties of Am-rican citizens;
and whereas, such an attempt to coerce and
compel the judgment and action of the elect
â ors of ihis commouwealth is a shame, an out
rage and a disgrace heretofoie unknown in
American history; therefore be it
tfetolved. That we, the executive committee
of ihe County Committee of the People's party
of .the City and County of San Francisco, rep
.resentiug ten thousand electors of this muni
-0 cipality, protest xgainat such coercion.
Ecsolved, further, That our Kegistration
Committee, which has appointed in every pre
cinct of this City two election officers pledged
io an honest count, be ana they are hereby
instructed to carefully scrutinize every ballot
as it is counted, and to compare the same
with the polling list, and if they shall find
that any appreciable number of railroad em
ployes have yielded to this tyrannous de
mand and have written upon their baUots
names of people, put there simply to identify
ttieir votes, that then they snail retort the
facts in detail at once to this committee.
The document closes with a threat to
indict and punish all who may transgress
in the manner outlined, and in the case ot
' .corporations to proceed against them for
. the forfeiture of their charters under the
purity of election laws.
Chairman Carleton H. Johnson and
Secretary George D. Gillespie signed this
remarkable effusion, in order to learn
what information they have on which to
base their alleged belief that coercion of
voters is intended a Call reporter visited
those gentlemen at the rooms of the Peo
ple's party in the Murphy building, corner
of' Market and Jones streets, yesterday.
;"Mr. Johnson can probably tell you
about that matter," suggested Mr. Gilles
. pie, and Mr. Johnson was first asked what
.facts he had in his possession that would
* justify the promulgation of such a proc
lamation.
"To tell tbe truth, I was not present
when that resolution was adopted by the
committee. I was under the weather that
evening, and not feeling very well did not
attend the meeting of the committee. I
understand that the resolution was pre
sented and vouched for by Mr. Burnette G.
Haskell."
"Was it adopted by the committee?"
was a*ked.
"I was so informed."
"You signed it, did you?" â 
"Yes."
"Did the committee just take Mr. Has
keli'B statement for all that the document
contains? 1 '
"Oh, I guess not I suppose they dis
cussed it some. I wasn't present, as I told
you before."
At this point Mr. Gillespie took up the
conversation. He said that he believed
there are a thousand men at least who
had been threatened with coercion, but he
wouldn't give a single name. His own I
brother-in-law had been threatened with
discharge, he said, if he did not march m
the McKinley parade to-day (Saturday),
but he wouldn't tell his name, either, for
fear he would lose his job.
Thns this marvelous bugaboo flattened
out, so that the only man of whose coer
cion tbe slightest clew can be obtained is
Mr. Ghllespie's brother-in-law, and even
"â  bis name cannot be learned in order to
find out whether he is in the list of regis
tered voters.
Mr. Hitskell is considered among agita
tors to be a lawyer and among lawyers he
is deemed to be a noisy agitator. He is a
rabid talker and writer on certain phases
of socialistic affairs and is seldom regarded
as levei-headed where practical matters of
every-day lite are under discussion.
Of course if Mr. Haskell wished to mark
bia ballot in the way he says the "coerced"
men must marK theirs be might "write his
own or some other name on the ballot he
shall cast for some office," and by getting
a few others to do tlie same an impression
might be snread ttia( the accusation in the
it-solution was well founded; butof course
Mr. Haskell would hardly oo that. It
would not be found out until afler elec
tion and then it would be too late to be of
any use to Mr. Hnskel! or tho3e who sym
pathize with him either in sentiments or
methods of political warfare.

JOHN RILEY`S GRATITUDE
It Is Shown in the Pretty
Story of a Church
Window.
Incident of the Wreck of the Steamer
City of Chester Recalled by a Gift
to St. Andrew's Church.
St. Andrew's Church, Oakland, has been
the recipient of several beautiful stained
glass windows. The main or chancel
window, which is divided into three lan
cets, will contain in the center an artistic
figure of St. Andrew, with the emblem of
his martyrdom. The Dicture is sur
rounded by a frame of Gothic architecture
and has two side lancets of a grisaille pat
tern containing emblems of the Holy
Spirit and Agnus Dei respectively. Across
the base of the three lancets is the inscrip
tion: "In memoriam Mr. and Mrs. John
Riley."
An interesting story attaches to this par
ticular window, which is the main one of
St. Andrew's Church. James Riley of
Stained-Glass Window Presented to St
Andrew's Church by Mr. Riley.
! this City was a passenger on the ill-fated
City of Chester, that was run down in the
bay of San Francisco by the Oceanic, as
she was steaming outward under a slow
bell through a bank of fo<;. The Chester
was bound for Eureka, Humboldt County,
which was also Mr. Riioy's deslination.
After the wreck Mr. Riley found himself
penniless, for he had ma ie the mi-take of
carrying all the money he possessed in a
satchel, instead of getting a draft on
Eureka. The satchel with its little sack
of gold went to the bottom of the bay.
In this predicament he r< acbed EureKa
on another steamer and there made him
self known to the Rev. Mr. riulme, a min
ister in that city. Mi. Hulme took him
under his protection and found him em
ployment.
Subsequently the friendly pastor moved
io O.'kland, where he is now rector of St.
Andrew's. Then Mr. Riley returned to
San Francisco, and his attachment to Mr.
Hulme caused him to move to Oakland so
that he mipnt attend St. Andrew's
Church. When the rector spoke of his
wish to replace the plain old windows of
tie church, with stained glass ones, Mr.
Riley, without a moment's hesitation,
presented the triple chancel window,
which is one of the Handsomest of its kind
in Oakland. The window is (he design of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1896.
GOLD DEMOCRATS
ARE WIDE AWAKE
Warning All True Party
Members Against
Bryanism.
Caution to Beware of Mistakes
in Marking tbe
Ballot.
LURKING AN AHCHY IS DREADED
Designing Po iticians May Seek to
Obtain Supp rt fcr the Chicago
Nomine:.
The sound money Democrats of Cali
fornia have recently become aroused to
the danger which they think threatens
their Presidential electoral ticket in this
State on account of mistakes that voters
are liable to make on election day.
It is believed that on account of two
Democratic, tickets being on the official
ballot some true and patriotic Democrats,
who abhor anarchy, Populism and repu
diation, and who would prefer to vote for
sound money* may be deluded into cast
ing their tickets for Bryan and Sewall-
Watson, when in fact they wish to be
recorded in favor of Palmer and Buckner.
In order to guard against any such mis
take the executive committee of tbe Na
tional Democratic party has been sending '
out circulars warning voters to be on
their guaid, and not to vote for Bryan
Pres dential electors, just because they
happen to be labeled "Democrat" on the
official ballot, bat to pass down the list of
names until they reach the National Dem
ocratic Presidential electors.
Bciow wili be found a copy of one of the
circulars that has been sent broadcast
throughout the State:
PALMER AND BUCKNER,
Defenders of their party's faith and of their
country's honor.
DEMOCRACY, ATTENTION I
VOTE FOX THE
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
That means a vote for honest money, an hon
est dollar for every man, no repudiation of our
debts, the maintenance of the credit and faith
ol our Nation, one law and one constitution
for the poor man and for the rich man, for the
North and South, for the East and West.
VOTE FOR THE
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
Organized in repudiation of the Bryanism,
Altgeldism and Tillmauism of the Chicago
Deinocrntic platform, and preserve the unity
and integrity of the principlesdear to Democra
cy. Lot the true and loyal Demociacy re|>udi>ite
the I'opuiistic heresies of the Chicago platform
and vole for the
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC ELECTORS:
Clay W. Taylor oi Shasta County, Tnomas B.
Bond of Lake County. James K. O'Brien of
Vubii County, John Rosen feid of San Fran
ei.-00, Jeremiah Lynch oi San Francisco,
Charles Anderson of Santa Barbara County,
John Roth of Tulare County, Robert Y. Hayne
of Sat: Mateo County, L. B. Makes of San Diego
County.
Members of the committee feel that the
names of the gentlemen on this ticket
form sufficient guaranty of the merit of
the cause which they represent, and they
deem it necessary to put forth this warn
ing lest voters may be imposed on by
scheming politicians In the interest of Mr.
Brya.i and his double-tailed Vice-Presi
dential kite.
In tbe past week a great many encour
aging letters have been received from dif
ferent parts of tbe State by the managers
of the Democratic sound money campaign
in California. From all directions hopeful
tidings are coming. In some of the
smaller towns of the northern part of the
State Bryanism appeared to have gained
some headway soon after the nominations
were made, but as the campaign of educa
tion progresses t ere has been a percepti
ble diminution of the current of opinion
in that direction, and Democrats of the
old school are lining up for sound money
and National honor and prosperity, just
as it was expected they would as soon as
Palmer anil Buckner were put in the field.
This change of sentiment is due in great
part to the excellent service performed by
the literary bureau of the National Demo
cratic party, with headquarters in the
Mills building. Nearly a million pieces
of campaign literature have been dis
tributed by the committee, and the eager
ness of the people for this kind of reading
matter indicates clearly that the Demo
cratic party in California has within its
folds enough advocates of sound money
to practically disrupt that organization,
thus guaranteeing the Republican party a
larger plurality over its divided opponent
than it could possibly hope to score if the
Democratic forces presented a eolid front.
All the elements of success lead Mc-
Kinleyward and shrewd politicians
everywhere are convinced that the cham
pion of honest money and American pro- .<
tection will sweep the State with victory
such as was never before known in Cali
fornia.
COMPARISON OF IDEALS.
Rabbi Vcorsanger Considers
Jewish and Christian
Beliefs
He Avcws His Faith in the Unity of
Creeds When One Prayer
Will Sulfice.
Rnbbi Voorsanger delivered a lecture
Friday evening at the Temple Emanu-El,
on Suttnr stre< t, before a large congregt
tion. The lecture was the first of a series
of discourses on a comparison of Christian
and Jewish ideas of life.
The eloquent lecturer said that despite
the tremendous amount of light which tbe
j world has received in the past fifty years
there still exists the grossest ignorance
among the masses of the people about
Judaism. To the generality of t.e people,
he ndded, the ,bislory of Israel is a closed
book, ending with tbe last scene in the
passion on Calvary. Kepresentations
which have become a part of Christian ed
ucation, so Rabbi Voorsanger said, have
created a good deal of unrest and wrong
opinions of Judaism. Christianity is the
las: revelation and has come to be re
garded in ti is teaching the only means of
salvation by which humanity may ever
reach the throne of God.
"The world of fifty years ago differs
from the world of to-day." continued tbe
I speaker. "An examination of Christianity
is absolutely impossible without an in
vestigation into Judaism, ita language,
' 1 turgy, literature and law?. Jesus oi
Nazareth was a Jew, his apostles were
Jews, the ethics taught by them were
Jewish ethics. The maxims taught by Jesus
were maxims taught by Jewish rabbis. The
ideals taught by the Jews in that time
wÂ»>re the sell-same ideals tauebt before tie
possibility of a universal Christianity ever
arose."
Rabbi Voorsanger then showed in what
respects the ideals of Jewish and Christian
faith were aliKe. He began by defining
the meaning of the word Messiah as a title
of courtesy Addressed by Jews to dignitaries
who were anointed, and is the same as the
English word Christ, which means tbe
anointed.
Unlike other religions which believed
that the golden age existed in t.edira
past, the principle of the Jewish idea is
that tbe golden age is in the distant
fuiure; that man was born good and per
fect and has power to raise- himself in
goodness; that he is rising from one high
plane to another. And when riaen to the
highest pinnacle of mentality be will be
able to see his god. Among the nations
that have suffered most will be seen the
ideals of human life. "You must go to
Israel, the down-trodden and oppressed,
to see It," exclaimed the. eloquent rabbi.
"None of the ideals of the prophet are as
ye* realised. In all of the prophesies we
read, 'It shall come to pas? in the latter
days.' While one smail sect of Jews held
that the Messiah must be divine, not a
single prophet or sage ever consented to
such a proposition. The departure from
that ideal has been the difference between
Jt-wsand Christians."
The Messianic prayer of Israel is that in
which Israelites remember their dead.
It contains the words "Thy kingdom
come." "Our Father in Heaven" is the
Kadish of the Christians. This is the
common ground, and the rabbi declared
his faith that this will be the r>rayer when
people shall not confess different gods.
It is an ideal shared by Christian and
Jew alike.
READY FOR INVESTMENT.
Vast Sums of Money in the
Banks of San Fran
\
C SCO
McKinley's E ection Will C&use the
C sli to Be Invested in Busi
ness Enterprises
Bankers and financial men of San Fran
cisco assert that business plans and new
enterprises wait on the result of the elec
tion next Tuesday. The amount of cap
ital awaiting investment is unusually
large. Bankors do not care to give out
definite statements regarding new enter
prises in view, but they freely acknowl
edee that the reserves of money are extra
ordinary.
William Alvord, president of the Bank
of California, was asked to give an
estimate of the amount of money wait
ing on the result of the election for in
vestment in business plans and new en
terprises.
He replied that no one could accurately
state the amount, and doubted if it could
be approximated. He was sure that the
announcement of McKinley's election
would release a vast amount of money
now on deposit in the commercial banks,
and large sums locked up in the sale de
posits. When confidence i 3 restored the
men who have locked up their coin will
bring it out to get 6 per cent interest.
Apart from the money suing out to move
tne crops there is little doing. P:ans ana
enterprises of a easiness character are
held in suspense awaiting the result of the
election.
The same story is told at the London, '
Paris and American Bank. Charles Alt-,
schul, the manager, could not estimate
how much money was waiting investment
on the decision of the election next Tues
day, but tie directed attention to the 'fact
that the reserve on band in his bank was
70 per cent of the deposit^ although the
usual accommodations had been extended.
The bank would be well satisfied with a
reserve of 40 per cent. There was some in
vestment of money to move the crops,
but apart from that there was little de
mand from legitimate commercial enter
prise.
Philip N. Liliienthal, manager of the
Anglo-Californian Bank, said to his knowl
edge business transactions involving the
legitimate use .of , 11.000,000 had been
turned down by reason of remote doubt as
to. the result of the Presidential election.
He was of the opinion that if McKinley
snould be elected by an overwhelming or
a decisive majority confidence would be
restored in commercial circles- The
money now held in reserve would be re
leased for profitable investment*.
Adam Grant, president of the Donohoe-
Kelly Banking Company, one of the ablest
and best known of San Francisco mer
chants, entertains the belief that the elec
tion of McKinley would re-establish confi
dence in business circles and bring about
a much better state of affairs.
Samuel G. Murphy, president of the
First National Bank, says that his institu
tion has 70 per cent of its deposits in â  re
serve. He acknowledges that there is
little demand for money to invest in new
and legitimate, commercial enterprises.
Bankers who do . not care to be quoted
mention that large sums in* coin' have
been withdrawn from -the banks and
stored in tbe safe deposit boxes. Still the
amount of idle coin held by the banks Is
prodigious. Depositors will not take any
chances while there is the least danger of
Bryan's election.
Next Tuesday night when the returns
begin to come over the wires announcing
McKinley majorities* and giving positive
assurance of Republican triumph plans
of investment will be proposed. The
money now idle in the banks and vaults
wili soon be brought out for investment in
enterprises of industrial development.

J. D. Grant of This City Denies That
His Brotber-in-Law Ik Deud.
The following dispatch appeared in yes
terday's issue:
BT. LOITIS, Mo., Oct. 30.â Yesterday morning
an unknown man was taken to the City Hos
pital suffering from an overdose of morphine.

be reassured to learn that the report was

LOUIS JANIN RETURNS
After Two Years in Australia
He Is Back With Lots
of Money.
Placed a Great N w South Wales
Property in Londonâ lnterest
in Mining.
Louis Janin Jr., alter over two years in
Australia, has returned to ' his home in
California ; and ' is . being greeted .by his
friends. He registered at the Occidental
Friday, and had 'â¢ considerable to say in
reference to his experiences abroad.
Mr. Jahin went to Australia almost un
known, if by never having visited a coun
try is to make onÂ« unknown. He travel d
over the great mining districts, examining
carefully into their gold resources. Finally
he got control of ? a leading mine in New
South Wales, and then in mining parlance
"took it to London." ; While there he sold
it for a Jarge figure, after remaining some
months.
He is now on his way back to Australia,
but- will not sail immediately, since he
wants to meet bis friends, after his long
absence: Mr.' Janin says there is consid
erable interest in London in California
gold mines. Investors, however, want good
properties. After the election probably
they will buy more freely. The London
Exploration Company is buying more
properties by. far on the Pacific Coast than
any other company. ;It already owns the
great mines, of , Alaska, one; or two big
properties in Mexico' and elsewhere and is
doing some big development work on
properties secured on the mother lode in
California. " : ; : ' :
â¢ Mr. Janin, awhile before going to Aus
tralia, went to New York in connection
with important mining properties., While
there he began writing technical matter
lor the New York Engineering and â¢Min
ing Journal. He at length became man
aging editor, and held that position for a
year. ; -. -v. .â¢ \ - . â¢Â» .."â 
â¢ He, was born in Virginia City, and is yet
quite a young man to have made such
successes. , His father, Louis Janin , Sr.,
said last night that considering he had
gone to Australia and London almost on
his own account, and had succeeded with
out any powerful aid, he: had done very
well. ir^ ; :
INDICTED DEPOSITORS.
Seven Men Accused of Libeling Judge
Hebbard Arraigned.
The seven People's Bank depositors re
cently iudicted by tAe Grand Jury for
publishing an alleged libel about Judge
Hebbard were yesterday arraigned before
Judge Daingerfield.
But two of the accused men were pres
ent, T. H. McCarthy and Thomas 8.
Williams, the others being represented by
Barclay Henley. Julius Kahn, who ap
peared as special counsel for the prosecu
tion, insisted that the pleas of the in
dicted men be heard at once, as the offense
of which they are accused is part of a cor
rupt politic^ scheme to aeteat Judge
Hebbard at the coming election. Judge
Dainserrieid, however, refused to do_ as
Kiihn nsked, holding that the accused are
entitled to iwo days in which to plead and
that anyhow the crowded condition of his
calendar would prevent the hearing of the
case until after the election. The matter
was, therefore, continued until next
Wednesday.

JTOB FKKSIDENTâ
'. : : '; WILLIAM HcKINLEY, of Ohio
JTOB VICF-PRESIDENTâ
GARRET A. HOBART, of New Jersey
Election November 3, 1896.
The shouting is over.
It was a great day for patriots.
Reed's speech was an inspiration.
The next big thing is the balloting.
California will be on tbe rieht side.
Banner day surpassed all expectation.
Old Glory rouses the people every time.
Victory is ready to light on her favorite
perch. _
It is a sure thing for McKinley and
Hobart
Everybody says "I never saw anything
like it."
It looked as if all California had come
to town.
Well done, Mr. Hanna. The idea was
glorious.
It was truly the gala day of returning
prosperity.
The classes and the masses are together
on this issue.
There was fervor in tbe shouting aa well
as enthusiasm.
We know now what San Francisco will
do on Tuesday.
Free trade we were willing to try, but
repudiation never.
Recreate yourself to-day. There is work
for you to-morrow.
We can rest with satisfaction to-dayâ
the country is safe.
This will be a morning of Congratulation
among good citizens.
The vast procession looked like a holi
day, but it meant business.
.American workingmen will never vote
to discount their own dollar?.
Remind your friends to-day that to
morrow is a good time to work for Colonel
Taylor.
Popocrats may begin babbling again this
morning, but they were dumfounded
yesterday.
It is very evident now that M.cKinley's
appeals to patriotism have touched the
popular heart.
After the display of yesterday any fur
ther talk of coercion will sound like the
babble of a lunatic.
The one thing to be done now is to make
sure of getting out every vote for tbe right
men on election day.
We are nearly through with Bryanism
and Clevelandism won't last long. The
hard times are about over.
For a long time to come people will
talc of the great procession, and those
who missed it will be sorry for themselves.
Labor and capital are not foes, but
friends. They will vote together for a
chance to work together for the benefit of
both.
Even those who doubted once are san
guine now. San Francisco will give Mo-
Kin-ley a majority that her people can be
proud of.
The long-expected Bryanite canard may
be turned loose this morning, but don't
let it disturb your day of rest. It cannot
hurt anything.
American labor and American capital
have a mutual pride in the greatness of
the Republic, and nothing can divide
them in patriotism.
The enthusiasm of yesterday will sur
vive until Tuesday, and all citizens will
go to tbe polls resolute to make tbe vic
tory a Waterloo for Bryanism.
Honest-money Democrats who marched
in tbe parade yesterday found themselves
in such congenial company they can be
counted on to stay with it hereafter.
All over the Union tbe people were pa
rading yesterday in honor of McKinley
and Hobart. It was a National uprising
for patriotism, protection and prosperity.
The voice of the people nominated Mc-
Kinley, the strength of the people sup
ported him in tbe campaign and the votes
of an overwhelming majority will elect
him on Tuesday. -
The utter futility of the Bryanite ap
peals to prejudice and passion in this
campaign proves the intelligence of tbe
American people and attests their gcorn of
agitators and mischief-makers.
This country never saw a better cam
paign manager than Mark Hanna. He
has urged the work with vim and vigor
from the start and wound up the fight
with the biggeÃt flourish on record.
THE PARADE.
The Republican parade of yesterday was
beyond all question the greatest political
demonstration which California has ever
made or which, in any State west of the
Mississippi River, has ever been seen. In
numbers, in order, in enthusiasm, in
diversity ana in significance it outrivals
all previous efforts of any political party
in making a display of its hold upon the
popular mind. No amount of eulogy
could magnify its importance, and no at
tempt at detraction could minify its im
mense significance as a forecast of the
election and of the way that people of
California will vote thereat.
The parade was a gratifying surprise to
those who planned it, but it was an
astounding revelation to those who, pre
vious to its occurrence, attempted to de
cry it. The vast company of marching
men who made up its divisions mani
fested the faith of the voters of California,
of every occupation and of every station
in the Republican party. Thero were to
be seen empioyers and employes, manu
facturers and wage-earners, bankers and
bank depositors, rich men and poor men,
old men and young men, marching,
cheering and shouting, side by side.
In the presence of the enthusiasm
which they displayed at every point
along the line of march the silly sug
gestion of coercion was put to shame, to
gether with every hope of those who have
expressed it, that the paraders would vote
on next Tuesday otherwise than as they
marched in the parade.
The significance of this great demons
tration ib evident to every one who beheld
it. As the aun of noonday dispelled the
clouds of morning that it might be a com
plete success so has the parade dispelled
every cloud of doubt as to the result of tLe
election. It has demonstrated beyond
further question that the City of San
Francisco will roll up an unprecedented
vote for the Republican electors on Tues
day next When the social forces, the
organized industries, the learned profes
sions, the various elements and agencies
of industry and order in the community
all unite to openly display their adherence
to the principles and the candidates of a
political party it does not require much
reasoning to reach a conclusion as to the
success of that party.
The grand assembly which attended the
address of Speaker Reed in the evening
fitly closed the demonstration of the day.
The great orator was given a welcome
which amply proved the regard of Cali
fornians for his character, his services and
his leadership. The very enthusiasm of
the audience, aroused to a true fervor by
the grand parade, had in it an element of
difficulty for the orator. Few men could
rise above the level of that mighty tide of
popular sentiment and lead it higher still,
as the moon leads the waves. Speaker
Reed did it. He was equal to the great
ness of the occasion, and by the eloquence
and wisdom of his words lifted the minds
of his listeners as by inspiration, and sent
them to their homes with hearts throbbing
with the earnestness of devoted patriotism.
The City of San Francisco thus gave
ample demonstration yesterday as to which
way the great masses of its best citizens
will cast their votes. The election-day will
not make more certain than the parade
has done the fact that California will go
Republican by a large majority upon
Tuesday next. The Republican leaders
who planned and brought to perfection
this mighty demonstration of popular
favor for the Republican party are en
titled to praise for the entire success of
the great day.

THE ISSUES AT STAKE.
Yesterday we closed the campaign. The
time which remains before election day
will be fully occupied in arranging for
bringing out the full vote of the re
spective parties. It is.well> therefore, for
every citizen to recall the issues which are
at stake, and by meditating upon their im
portance arrive at a determination to vote
and to vote right.
Four years ago, deceived by agitators
and the false promises of free-traders, the
people put into power a party which at
once set about tbe destruction of the pro
tective system. Since that time we have
had nothing but annual deficits in tbe
National revenue, increase of the National
debt and disasters in every trade and in
dustry. Knowing that to make a cam
paign on these issues would mean an
overwhelming defeat, the desperate and
reckless politicians, who have control of
the Democratic organization entered into
an alliance with Populism and have
sought to obtain a chance of success by
raisins a new issue before the country.
The issue thus raised would be even
more dangerous and disastrous than free
trade. It would mean tbe beginning in
tbe American Government of the first
steps toward a regime of socialism which
would entirely revolutionize tbe structure
of our Government and convert it. into a
despotism under the form of a Republic.
It might prove even worse than that, for
as the men who are iq the lead of the new
movement are utterly incapable of de
visintt or carrying out a scheme of orderly
socialism, their blunders and folly, their
passions and their bate might easily
awaken Buch discord and disturbances in
the country as would bring us to the verge
of anarchy.
The experience of the past four years is
sufficient to convince every man that the
welfare of his industry and the coniforis
of bis home depend in a large measure
upon legislation at Washington. He has
felt the direful results of Clevelandism.
In the light of that experience let him
consider what would be the result of
Bryanism. Let him consider what would
corue from a Government presided over by
a reckless and fanatical orator, and domi
nated by Altgeld and Tiliman. Let him
reflect upon what would follow the depre
ciation of our currency from its present
value UÂ» v that of filver bullion. Let him
try to" estimate tbe cost to all who have
savings in the banks, insurance policies,
pensions, and debts due them. Let him
reflect upon the effect that would be pro
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER I, 1896.
duced upon trade and industry by the in*
troduction of a fifty-cent dollar.
It will need in him no great intelligence
to see that such a change in our monetary
system, even if Bryanism meant nothing
else, would be destructive of the welfare of
all. When to the folly of free silver and the
dishonor of repudiation is added the mad*
ness involved in the attack upon the
Supreme Court and in the denial to the
General Government of the right to enforce
its laws, it will be seen that the Chicago
platform means nothing less than revolu
tion. Patriots can have no choice in such
an issue as is presented to them in this
contest. A vote for Bryan is a vote for
ruin, while a vote for McKinley is a vote
for every promise that dawns for as in tbe
streaks of morning light that rad iate on
our National flag and for every hope that
shines for us in the glory of its eternal
stars.
We want that confluence that will
leud the bu.iues* man to tract in the
future and make plans for the year's
work. We want that confidence that
will induce the me > of capital to put
their money out, haviug faith that i*
will be paid back to them in as good
coin as they loan, principal and inter
est, tend until you get that you will
have no permanent prosperity or busi
ness activity â McKinley.
PATRIOTISM AGAINST PASSION
This campaign has been, on the side of
Republicans and honest-money Demo-
crats, an appeal to patriotism against the
Bryanite appeals to passion and prejudice.
T. c aim of all who uphold the cause of
McKinley and Hobart has been to remind
all classes of the people that they are citi
zens of the same country, that their in
terests are one and that they have a mu
tual welfare as well as a mutual loyalty.
As Major McKinley himself has said:
"This is not a partisan campaign. It
j rises altogether above that. It is a cam
i Tiaijrn for the United States. Its honor,
! its Credit, its currency, and i!s welfare."
| None can question the truth of these
I statements, nor will there be any ques
i tion of the importance of his invocation
| to the people that on election day "we
i may all be inspired by the same blessed
spirit of patriotism that moved the grand
and pireat men who founded our Govern
j ment."
Mr. McKinley's appeals to patriotism
have been supported by every orator and
every newspaper which has advocated his
! election. Not one single appeal to pas-
I sion, prejudice, envy or hxte has beeu
uttereu or printed any advocate of the
cause for which the Republican party
stands. Everything has been said to allay
any possible feeling or animosity that
might exist between any classes of the peo
ple or any sections of the Union, and
again and again has it been shown that
what the grand old party seeks in th is
j campaign is the prosperity of the Nation
i and the comfort, welfare and happiness of
I all its people.
We urge every citizen to-day to reflect
I upon this contrast between the manner in
wb'ch the campaign Has been conducted
by the rival leaders and their rival sup
porters. We ask every voter to weigh
well the difference between the speeches
of the Republican orators and those of the
Bryanites and to consider seriously what
that difference means for the Union. Are
we to have a people united and sections
harmonious or are we to have a disordered
people, wrangling sections and discord
I in every portion of our country ?
On this day of rest and leisure we can
not do better than to invite the people to
reflet seriously upon the solemn and
weighty words of Benjamin Harrison:
I preach this doctrine that here under that
good ffag, the symbol of freedom, under this
I arching sky, where any young man may set
I his aspirations as high aa the start if ho
| wishes; that we should have a kindly feellnit
between men; that every man should rejoice
m every other man's prosperity; that all are
united and that we should all work together â
not rend men asunder, not embitter men with
prejudice, but put these sweet influences of
prosperity Into every home and the sweet in
fluence of charity and love into every heart.
It is the duty of every true patriot to act
in the spirit of those words when he goes
to the polls on election day. If we vote
for the unity of the people, for kindly feel
ing between man and man, for a pros
perity which will be mutual between all
citizens and between all sections of the
Union, we shall cast the ballot of a pa
triot. Such a ballot every Rood citizen
must aspire to vote, and he has been but
a dull observer of the course of the cam
paign if he does not see tnat such a vote
must be in this campaign for the Republi
can candidates, McKinley and Hobart.
Look at it in whatsoever way yon
please and it \rlll be found that tbe
true interests of the employe are in
separable from those of the employer.
It U therefore the duty of every one
to strive to harmonise these two great
interests, and he who tries to arraign
one against the other is a public en
emy. â Marcus A. Hanna.
VICTORY ASSURED.
The Sunday preceding a Presidential
election has been always a day of specula
tion concerning the probable outcome of
the campaign. It has been a day when
the American people have reviewed the
course of the contest, weighed the argu
ments on both sides, estimated the com
parative strength of tbe opposing ele
ments and endeavored to determine not
only how they should vote but what
would in all likelihood be the vote of the
majority of the American people.
There will be no speculation of that
kind this morning. This campaign, in
many respects different from any in oar
history, has shown sucb a combination of
the betttr elements of the people on one
side that there can be no doubt of tht re
suit nor any doubt how intelligent men
will vote.
What workingman will vote to reduce
the purchasing power of his wages 50 per
cent? What man who has savings in
the bant, an insnrance policy, a pension
or a fixed income from any source will
vote to reduce th<> revenue which enables
him to support his family? What busi
ness man will vote for a commercial cri
sis? What man engaged in industry will
vote for the ruin of his trade? These
questions answer themselves. Tbe Ameri
can people are united aa never before in
their history and the election of Mr. Mc-
Kinley is as certain as tbe coming of elec
tion day.
One of the good results of the campaign
will be tbe breaking up of tne Soiid South.
States that have been counted in former
elections as sure for the Democratic ticket
are now either doubtful or well assured
for McKinley. We can count among these
boutnern States Delaware, Maryland,
Kentucky and West Virginia as reason
ably sure for sound money, and there are
chances of carrying Louisiana, Tennessee
and Virginia for protection. Tbe Solid
South ceases to exist as a factor In poli
tics, and whatever issues may arise before
our people in the years to come it is not
likely they will ever again be sectional.
We congratulate good citizens this
morning on the outlook. Ihe grand pa
rades which marched through every great
city of ihe Union yesterday and the uni
versal flying of the National flag in cities
towns and villages all over tbe Uuion have
clearly attested the patriotism of the peo
ple. We are about to enter upon a new
era of prosperity. Clevelandism will be
overthrown and Bryanism repudiated.
We can look forward now to a degree of
National welfare which we have not
known for years. The dark clouds of de
pression and disaster which have so long
overcast the land are departing and, loot
iua- upward, we can see along the ragged
edges of these receding clouds tbe rising
sun of prosperity reflected from them in a
rainbow of glory overarching the Republic
from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
We do not propose to commence now.
after 130 yearn' glorious history, of
glorious life and glorious achievements,
to repudiate our obligations, public or
private. We do not propose to attempt
to ever do business with a dollar 1 cent
short of 100 cents We do not propose
to accept our financial sta-idard from
either Mexico or China.â McKiu ley.
FREE VOTERS.
The tenor of various articles in the Ex
aminer of yesterday makes it evident that
the tactics of the fusion managers in the
closing days of the campaign is to raise
the cry of coercion and to frirhten the
workingmen of the country as far as pos
sible into the belief that the resolute de
termination of the business elements of
the country to elect McKinley means an
attempt to coerce workingmen. This cry
of coercion will no doubt be raised thus
morning and to-morrow to the extent of a
great howl. We warn the people not to
be deceived by it. It is a foul black lie,
and the men who assert it know it to be
such.
We call the attention of the working
men of San Francisco to the appeal to
them published in The Call of yesterday
by the employes of the Southern Pacific
Company. The second paragraph of that
appeal said:
We are the employes of the Southern Pacific
Company. It has been asserted, not once but
many times, that in advocating the cause of
honest money in this campaign we are being
"coerced" and "intimidated" by our superior
officers. It has been charged that we are guided
L ln our political actions by subservience to the
company's interests and fear of official dis3
pleasure. This U not only, totally false, but it
is a gross and gratuitous insult toour manhood
and intelligence. We are men, not cowards.
We are citizens, not slaves. We resect the in
sult which is offered to us and propose to show
our resentment at the polls.
JThese words have the ring of true man
hood. They need no backing on onr part
or on the part of anybody. They speak
for themselves. They express the just in
dignation of American workingmen at the
fool and false charges which the Bryan ites
are making. Thousands of workingmen
will indorse them. It is hardly possible
that any American voter can be so false
to himself or the proud traditions of his
citizenship to be less indignant in express
ing his anger at these assaults upon his
manhood than were the workingmen who
issued the appeal.
America is the land of free voters. Our
Republic was founded by free men and is
maintained by free men. There has never
Deen coercion anywhere in politics except
in the South, and even there it was never
exerted except over tne poor and ignorant
negroes, whom long years of servitude had
rendered incapable of combining together
to withstand the tyranny of Bourbon
Democrats.
Employers in the Northern States in
the great majority of cases have them
selves oeen workingmeu. They have risen
from the ranks. They honor labor because
they have themselves been laborers. They
are true to the great principles of Ameri
can liberty, because it Das been through
those principles they have been enabled to
rise from poverty to comfort. They
neither seek nor desire to coerce any
workingmen. Every employe is lett free
to vote as he pleases.
None the less, however, do the business
men and the industrious workingmen of
this country intend to make it certain that
Bryanism cannot flourish in the United
State?, that the honor of the Republic
should be maintained, that its laws shall
be enforced, that its prosperity shall be
restored, and that the enemies of our
social organism shall be swept from the
field of politics by an overwhelming vote
of an indignant people.
MAKE AN END OF HIM.
New York Press.
As the political situation stanas to-day Mr.
Bryan will not get 100 electoral votes, while
more than 300 are assured to Major McKinley.
But because they will win so great a victory
Republicans should not relax their efforts.
The issue of free silver must be wiped out, and
the way to wipe it out n 10 beat the liie out of
Mr. Bryan.
At the very extreme Mr. Bryan should not
carry more than Alabama, Georgia, Florida,
Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana,
.Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Missouri and
Virginia. Of these Btates Missouri, Virginia
and Louisiana, with perhaps Texas, could be
taken away from him if there was a fair count
on election night. In Missouri and Virginia
it is more than likely that me sound-money
Democrats will be able to compel an honest
count. If they do the "Solid Boatn" will be
broken into fragments.
Major McKinley's victory will not be sec
tional. He will carry States in the South and
the extreme West, as well as all the Middle West
and the whole East. Keep up the work for
McKinley, so that Bryan's vote may be held
down to Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia,
Horlda, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, South
Carolina and Utah. Keep np the work to
tnelast! Bury Bryan and repudiation I
THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY.
New York Son (Dent).
When firyan left Nebraska in August for bis
ridiculous expedition to the .Madison-squs.ro
Garden he said that he was coming to "the
enemy's country."
Mr. Bryan it now in Illinois, speaking as in
doitriously and iruilleÃEly as be spoke in New
York. The East is still the enemy's country.
The West has become the enemy's country.
Illinois is the enemy's country. 80 Is Wiscon
sin. So is Minnesota. 80 Is lowa. 80 is
Michigan. So is Indiana. 80, it is said, is
Nebraska. On the Pacific Slope there seems to
be a large area of the enemy s country. One
or both of the Dakotas are thought to be
the enemy's country. Kentucky and West
Virginia hare the look of being the enemy's
country.
Bryan finds the enemy's country much en
larged tlnce he read his speech of acceptance.
The enemy may enlarge it still more for him
this week; and wherever the enemy's country
is there prevail the foes of rwindling and the
friends of the National honor.
OVERWHELMINGLY BEATEN.
Baltimore News.
The opinion that the News haa formed from
a close observation of the fight 1b all of tht
so-called doubtful States is that Bryan is over
whelmingly beaten. We feel more certain of
Maryland than we did at this time a year ago.
The Middle-Western Statesâ Ohio, Indiana and
Illinoisâ are McKinley's without reasonable
doubt. Wisconsin is almost as certainly his as
Massachusetts, and lowa is hardly less so.
Every sign visible ten days before the election
points to a Waterloo for Bryan. His campaign
petered out weeks ago.

VOTE FOR SUFFRAGE.
An .Appeal to Itorlc ngtnen for the Sixth
Amendment.
' There is no class of men in California who
should be so Interested in giving the ballot to
women as the wage-earners. There are said to
be 20,000 women in the City of San Francisco
alone who are earning their own living out
side of domestic service. All of these women,
of course, are disfranchised and so long as
this is the case they will be at a disadvantage,
and the men with whom they compete also
will be sufferers. What would be the condition
of fhe workingman without the franchise?
Where would be his power? Every party, every
candidate to-day makes his strongest and high
est bid for the labor vote. Without this a can
didate cannot be elected, nor a party hope to
be put into power. Parties and candidates are
willing to promise anytbiug, everything, fn
exchange for the votes of the workingmen,
and ii these promises are not kept the wage
earners can inflict the deserved punishment
at 'the next election. Takeaway their vote
and there would be but one way for . them to
enforce their demands, a method which need
never be resorted to in this country. The vote
is the safety-valve that prevents an explosion.
It is the weapon with which the oppressed
may defend themselves and It is the only one
permitted by the laws of our country.
Since this is so essential to the workingman
why is it not equally necessary to the working
woman? Their interests are identical, what
ever one needs the other needs. In the present
campaign one party tries to prove that Mark
liauna pays insufficient wages to the men in
his employ; the other party charges that
Sevan's employes are under paid, and these
are given as 'sufficient reasons for aefeat.
Now, if it were true that in either case the
men were paid the very lowest wages, which
it Is charged they are getting, they would be
far higher than tens of thousands of women
are receiving in all parts of the country. The
official statistics show that many of these
women receive from 12}Â£ to 15 cents for a
long day's labor, often 01 fourteen to sixteen
hours. â¢ * .
How . can workingmen stand by and see this
terrible injustice ? It is idle to say that the
ballot wouid not : partially, at least, remedy
these conditions. It will do for the working
woman all it does for the working man. If
every woman who is now compelled â 10 work
for 15 or 50 cents a day held in her hand a
ballot there would be legislative inquiry, and
the lawmakers and . the -candidates and the
politicians all would interest themselves iv
the emancipation of these woman slaves. In
helping these women, the workingmen will
help themselves. Their own wages must be
dragged down by the competition of this de
graded, disfranchised labor, an underbidding;
which, God knows, these unfortunate women
are not responsible for.
The necessity* for the enfranchisement of
women is recognized by all the foremost
leaders of the labor movement. Powderly,
Gompers, Arthur, Sargent,. . Debs, all. of them
pronounced advocates of woman suffrage. At
the great National convention. of the federa
tion of Labor in Atlanta, the strongest possible
resolution was adopted declaring for the en
franchisement of women. At the National
convention of the Knights of Labor in Wash
ington, D. C, a resolution was carried without
debate and by a rising vote, demanding the
franchise for all citizens without regard to sex.
At the National Trades Union Congress, which
met in Denver, -a resolution was adopted by
unanimous consent declaring in favor of abso
lute political and industrial equality for the
women of the United Slates. - j.ll New York
City organizations representing over 100.000
men wage-earners have signed petitions asking
suffrage for women. The central labor unions
ot: all the large cities have repeatedly put
themselves on record as favorable to woman
suffrage. There is probably not a newspaper
in the country published in the interest of
labor that does not stand for political rights
for women. :
By voting for the sixth amendment on No
vember 3 the labor organizations of Cahtornia
more man double their strength, They secure

men's families, but those of all the wage-earn
ing women of the. State. These women can be
depended upon to stand solid for the Interests
of labor, and to these may be added the votes
of many more women whose sympathies ana
whose work in the charities and reforms has
brought them in touch with the working peo
ple. â  . .-,. . â¢ â¢
More than all other men should the wage
earners feel a vital interest in giving the bal
lot to women, since, much as they . would love
to do so, they cannot keep the women of t.heir
families in that ease and comfort which sur
round those* of the wealthy, and therefore
they should give them every opportunity to
strengthen and protect themselves. The
daughters of these men who toil will in their
turn have to become breadwinners, and the
fathers and the brothers should grant them
every protection which it is in their power to
bestow, and the greatest of all is the franchise
the right which will enable them to protect all
other rights. In voting "yes" upon this sixth
amendment the workingman does something
more than Justice to all women â he directly
benefits and protects the women of his own
family. Â - ...,-.â .

part of any one to have it repealed. Women
have voted for twenty-five years in England

has been no attempt to interfere with business

A GIRL'S WRAPPER.
A wrapner is shown here lor little girl*. The
same model is shown in night gowns, and is
much liked for the simplicity of cut and the
ease with which it may be made at home,
there being only shoulder and nnder-arm
seams. The sleeve is the stylish bishop shape
and has but one seam.
Flannelette of pink with a white hair line
had a collar of white China silk.
Another wrapper was of light brown flannel
witn collar ol the same lined with blue China
silk, and finished with a ruffle of the silk.
Wrappers of washable fabrics are made of
heavier cottons such as duck, cheviot, etc
The collar may be left off for night dresses If
desired.
If muslin night dresses are made the collar
may be of batiste, lawn or other thin fabric.
A dainty finish is a narrow ruffle set on with
an open work veiling between ruffle and col
lar. This is put ou by making very narrow
French or bag seams. These are stitched with
the seam on the right side of garment, then
turned over and stitched again, hiding the
original seam.

TURKS IN CRITICISM. By Brander Mat
thews. N pw York, Harper <fc Bros. For sale by
A. M. Kobertson, 126 Post street, City; price
SI 25.
This is a collection of critical essays by
Brander Matthews, written or delivered by
him at various periods and now issued in book
form for the firs'* time. A study of the con
tents psge will give the reader some idea oi
the scope of the work: American Literature,
Two Studies of the South. The Penalty of
Humor, On Pleasing the Taste of the Public,
On Certain Parallelisms Between the Ancient
Drama and the Modern, Two Scotsmen of Let
ters (Andrew Lang and Robert Louis Steven
eon), Aspects of Fiction, L The Gift of Story

111. The Prose Tales of M. Francois Coppee;
IV. The Short Stories of Ludovlc Halevv; V.
Mr. Charles Dudley Warner as a Writer of Fic
tion: VI. Text Books of Fiction.
Whiie some of these essays are necessarily of
a fugitive or evanescent character, there are
several in this collection which amply serve to
bustain Mr. Matthews' reputation as one of the
foremost critics of the day. One of these is
that entitled "The Penalty of Humor," where
in have been set forth ihe disadvantages at
tendant upon the writer of a humorous work.
1 hut the author 61 such a book is handicapped
in bis future efforts is an axiom not to be dis
puted. We took occasion several weeks ago,
in these columns, to instance a case in point
that of Mark Twain, whose "Joan of Arc" was
a financial failure simply on account of the
fact that Mr. Clemens' reputation was made as
the producer of humorous books, and an an
appreciative public declined to recognize him
In the capacity oi a competitor with William
Harrison Ainsworth.
Mr. Matthews advances the theory tbat the
writing of the Declaration of Independence
was intrusted to Thomas Jefferson rather than
to Benjamin Franklin because the latter was
known to be possessed of a luxuriant sense of
humor. Notwithstanding the fact that Frank
lin's reputation was worid-wide, not merely
local, as was that of Jefferson, it was feared
that, to use a colloquialism, he might "make
a break," and so yie honor was accorded to the
Virginian.* The American lack of reverence,
noted by Matthew Arnold when he visited this
country, was largely present in the composi
tion of the author of "Poor Richard's Alma
nack," and it was not accounted a virtue in
him by the leaders of the Continental Con
gress.
As it was with Franklin so was it with Lin
coln. Says Mr. Matthews:
"Because Lincoln was swift to seize npon an
incongruity and because he sought relief for
his abiding melancholy in playfulness there
were not a few who refused to take him seri
ously. Even after his death there were hon
est folk who held the shrewdest and loftiest of
our statesmen to have been little better than
a buffoon. Of the three greatest Americans,
-Franklin, Washington and Lincoln, two were
humorists, and it is, perhaps, his deficiency of |
humor which makes Washington seem more
remote from us and less friendly than either
of the others."
Of autnors who have to pay the penalty of
humor Mr. Matthews cites the case of James
Russell Lowell. It will doubtless appear
Etrange to Americans to learn that before
he was appointed Minister to the Court of St.
James Lowell was known to the English read
ing public, not as the student, the critic and
the soholar, but "rather as the rival of Josh
Hillings!'* And this little misunderstanding
simply arose from the fact that in the Biglow
Papers "the dialect of Hosea was phonetically
represented with artistic feeling and scientific
precision."
The author of the present "Ventures in
Criticism" endeavors to find an explanation
for that feeling of condescension manifested
toward the humorist. Admitting that there
is no feeling of animosity in this attitude of
conscious superiority he utters a note of
warning against "a certain kind of wit, ol
which it is well to be distrustful, for it is dan
gerous." This he calls the "scoffing, girding
wit," and touching it be makes a remark that
will doubtless strike a home-thrust to some
American Journalists. "The persiflage of
Voltaire was of ten inspired by honest convic
tions; but there are writers en the newspapers
ol New York who nave cultivated a wit not
unlike Voltaire's, but with even less of sin
cerity in it, soiling whatever it touchesâcor
roding and disintegrating."
In his essay entitled "Two Scotsmen of Let
ters" Mr. Matthews has chosen for considera
tion two literary notabilitiesâ Andrew Lang
and Robert Louis Stevenson. For the first he
appears in the character of apologist and, to
speak the truth, the subject of bis sketch is
sadiy in need of interpretation to readers on
this side of the Atlantic, where he has, upon
numerous occasions, been endowed with the
attributes of a spitfire.
Comparing the two, Lang and Stevenson,
Mr. Matthews says:
"In differing degrees each was a poet and
each was master of a prose than which no
better was written in our language nowadays.
Mr. Lang's style has not the tortured felicity
of Stevenson's; its happiness is easier and less
willful. The author of â¢Letters to Dead Au
thors' is not an artificer of cunning phrase
like the author of 'Memoirs and Portraits';
his style is not handmade nor the result of
takinjr thought: it grows more of its own
accord. The style of each is transparent, but
while Stevenson's is as hard as crystal, Mr.
Lao g's is fluid like water; it flows and some
times it sings as it flows, like the beautiful
brooks he longs to linger beside, changing
with the sky and the rocks and the trees, bat
always limpid and delightful."
We have said tnat among American journal
ists Andrew Lang is generally recognized as
the spitfire of the British press. His antipathy
to American literature and to its makers is
Ruckstuhl's Statue of Solon for the Congressional Library.
well known both here and in England. In
treating of these matters, the author of the
work under review is good enough to censure
Lang in a milk and watery way for his
"doubtfully courteous attack on Professor
Boyeson," and remarks that "a more careful
understanding of American literary nistory
would have saved Mr. Lang from that farewell
to Poe in the 'Letters to Dead Authors,' in
which the author of the -Raven' is hailed as -a
gentleman among canaille!' "âsorely as
strange an opinion as one can find in all the
long annals of criticism. After this it is satis
factory to note in the study of Stevenson that
he, being a Scotsman, possessed a keener ap
preciation of American literature and charac
ter ; in fact, "was nearer to the American than
tne Englishman can be."
Stevenson's love of collaboration is noted in
the sketch of his lifework. For some reason or
other the author of "The Master of Ballantrae"
seems to have taken to Himself more literary
partners than any man of letters of our day.
"But," remarks Mr. Matthews in conclusion,
"as those only know who have themselves
collaborated in good faith, It is always impos
sible to disentangle the contribution of one
partner from that of the other, if, indeed,
there has been not a mere mechanical mix
ture, but a true chemical union. Whatever
associates Stevenson bad now and again, he
was the senior partner always, and it was his
trademark that warranted the goÂ«*fls of the
firm." Emantjel Elzab.

Genesis to Revelation are arranged in 365
consecutive readings of about twenty-five
verses each, and printed in clear type, without
note or comment. Difficult names are pro

HERE IS WEIRDNESS FOR YOU
IRAS, A MYSTEKY-By Theodore Touglas. New
York: Harper & Bros. For sjue by A. M. Rob
ertson, 120 Post street, City; price fl.
A weird book, powerfully written and clev
erly put together. It narrates the adventure
of one Ralph Lavenham, an Egyptologist, who
has had considerable experience in explora
tion work on the Upper Nile. He receives in
London from a friend in Luxor a sarcophagus
which when opened proves to contain a beau
tiful maiden, Iras, who hat been in a hyp
notic trance for 3000 years and is recalled to
life by Lavenham's touch. They leave the
Egyptologist's lodgings in London and go to
Edinburgh, where they are married. They
are henceforth pursued by the spirit, or astral
body, of Savak, the priest who loved Iras in
her former existence at Luxor. The power of
Savak is greater than that of Lavenham and
Iras, or of their mutual love, and finally over
comes them in the hills of Northern Scotland.
Lavenham is found half-dead in a snowdrift,
embracing a mummy. Upon recovering from
the ensuing illness he endeavors to prove to
his friend Knollys that the living Iras was a
reality, and he succeeds in adducing much
testimony, but the general opinion rests that
Lavenham has suffered from hallucinations
brought on by overwork and sunstroke and
a fever contracted several years before in
Egypt.
HAWTHORNE AND HACK- WRITING

Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Company. For
sale In this City by Joseph A. Hoffman, 120 Sui
ter atrert; price 75 cents.
' This is by no means a sample of Julian Haw
thorne's best work. It is a somewhat common
place story, having for its chief Incident the
search for and discovery of a hidden treasure
buried by the Aztec Indians. Around this the
author has woven a rather slender romance
culminating in the marriage of the searchers
to their lady loves, who assisted in the quest
for the treasure. Readers of some of Mr.
Hawthorne's earlier books will regret to see
bis name attached lo such a poor piece of
work as "The Golden Fleece," In which there
exists strong evidence that he Is degenerating
into something dangerously like a hack-writer
of fiction.

NEW CHART OF THE HEAVENS.
A complete series of star charts, by a mem
ber ot the California Academy of Sciences, the
work of some years of study and application,
is about tp be offered to the public. It con
sists of a series of six star charts for the use of
schools, amateurs, non-professional astrono
mers and observers. There are four equa
torial charts, containing all the stars visible
to the naked eye from the fifty-fifth degree
north to the fifty-fifth degree south declina
tion, and two charts of the hemispheres from
the poles to the equator.
The equatorial charts overlap two hours
right ascension each, showing every constella
tion entire. Every star is named, lettered or
numbered In accordance with the star cata
logues. The path of the sun, moon and planets
are from the American iSphemeris and Nau
tical Almanac, showing the loops in the track
of the planets as they appear to wander among
the stars. There are selections of the most in
teresting clusters, double stars, variables and
nebulss; also a list of the brightest sUrs in the
constellations, with their Hebrew and Arabic
names and meanings, from the writings of
TJlnb Beigb, an astronomer of the fifteenth
century (A. D. 1420).
The charts arc made from the star cata
logues of the United States' Observers, the
B. A. C. and other standard works on as
tronomy.
The charts are blue prints, showing the
stars clear and white on a dark background,
easily seen by moonlight, extremely conven
ient ior amateur observers who do not care to
burden themselves with the larger works and
the confused mass of stars of ihe lesser magni
tudes.
Any person with these charts and the help of
Loekyer's Elementary Astronomy and a few
evenings' stndy can easily distinguish the
constellations and point out all the principal
stars visible and realize the beauty and sub
limity of the stndy of astronomy. Astronomy
is not so difficult a study as is generally sup
posed. It is as easy to comprehend the dis
tance of millions of miles as the millions of
dollars of a capitalist, or the thousands of
stars as the thousands of houses or inhabitants
in a large city, where each one has a name
and location; or the numbers of birds, ani
mals and other things we are familiar with.
And we can remember the names of the prin
cipal stars as well as the names of our inti
mates and great men and women of this and
other countries. This work will be sold at a
very low price compared with other publica
tions on the same subject,

Dr. Ne wkirk has put into verse the important
facts concerning the various States of the

their products and leading manufactures, aud
often facts concerning their settlement, etc.
It is not a mere dry enumeration, for the
jingle of the verse will impress the salient feat
ures of the different States upon the memory
of the reader. Mr. Fenn's illustrations will
also aid the memory, for he shows the like
ness of the outlines of the States to familiar
objectsâ lndiana to the head of an Indian
with a head-dress of eagle feathers and New
Mexico to an adobe bouse, for instance. There
is also a page containing silhouettes of the
States all drawn to the same scale, showing
the relative sizes, and one showing the rank
of the several States aud Territories according
to produces and industries.
A PATRIOTIC POEM.
THE MARCH TO THE SEA. By Major 8. H.
M. Brers. Boston: Arena Publishing Com p Mir.
For sale by booksellers; price, cloth, 91 26;
paper, SO cents.
Here we have a patriotic, narrative poem by
Major 8. H. M. Bvers, author of the famous
"Sherman's March to the Sea." A fine poetical
compound is made by the simplicity of these
war stories told in bold, martial verse, soft
ened, as it often is, by the slower heartbeats of
a soldier in reverie. The whole poem is
charecd with tie action of battlefields, bat
modernized by a spirit free from hateful bitter
ness. Humanity in its noblest rage cries
aloud from its lines. It is far from common
place, and yet the universal life is
everywhere disclosed in it. Wit, humor,

nanimityâall the finest war thoughts and
potenciesâ are In it. It is worthy of note that
on the great Sherman monument which is to
be erected at Washington the following lines
from Major Byer's poem, "Sherman's March to
the Sea," will appear:

OPENS UP NEW FIELDS ;
GOLD. By Annie Linden. New York: The
Ceii t Or y Company. Price f 1 88.
A novelist who can cerry his reader! to new
fields is somewhat of a rarity in these days,
when so much of the world has been parceled
out among- the writers of fiction. This is what
Miss Linden has accomplished, however, in ;
her Dutch-Indian novel. The itory opens
with a picture of the quiet life in Holland in
the family of a retired East Indian merchant,
who lives only among his books. His son. the
hero of the story, whose mind is somewhat
unsettled by the religious unrest of the day, is
sent to Java to take charge of business in
terests. At Genoa he meets a young lady
bound for the same destination. During the
long sea voyage they are thrown into close
intimacy, and friendship gradually ripens
into love. To test the depth and permanence
i of this affection the hero plunges into the
Light of Their Davj.
An Idle poet, here and there,
Looks round him, bat for all the rest,
The world unfatbomably fair,
Is duller than a witling's l?st.
Love wakes men once a lifetime each,
They lift their heavy lids and look,
And lo! what one sweet page can teach
They read with joy, then shut the book.
And some give thanks, and some blaspheme,
And most forget: buteituer way
That and the child's unheeded dream
Is all the light of all their day.

LITERARY NOTES.
Laird & Lee announce the Immediate publi
cation oi Opie Read's new story, entitled "My
Young Master."
The Frederick A. Stokes Company of New
York has just published "Sweetheart Travel
ers," by S. R. Crockett.
One hundred and fifty copies of the new
Thistle Edition of J. M. Barries works were
printed on Japan paper and every copy had
been subscribed for before a single volume
was ready for delivery.
The American Publishers' Corporation has
Dublisned a cheap edition of Edward
W. Townsend's "Daughter of the Tene
ments," with all of Mr. Keinble's illustrations.
It is announced, by the way. that the story has
been dramatized and will be produced on the
stage in November.
A book that since its publication a year ago
has been steadily growing in favor with the
American public is "The Sowers," by Henry
Seton Merriman (H. S. Scott). In England it
is regarded as one of the best and at the same
time one of the most successful novels of the
season.
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons announce
that through the courtesy of Rudyard Kip
lirg's publisners â Messrs. Macmillan, Messrs.
Appleton and the Century Company â they
have arranged to issue a collected edition of
the author's works, to be sold only by sub
scription. A few copies will be printed on
paper made specially for the set in Japan,
each leat bearing Mr. Kipling's autograph ini
tials in water-mark.
Kenyon West's book on "The Laureates of
England" has attracted considerable attention
in England, where it has had a vary good sale.
Mr. Gladstone wrote a personal letter in regard
to it, as follows : "I appreciate the honor you
do the 'old country' in taking literary notice
of the curious subject of the laureateship.
There is much history connected with it It
seems always to have been a difficulty. I de
clined to advise filling it up. Yet, Salisbury
1 has done otherwise. Kenyon West's selections
from the works of the laureates, and passing
them in memories, are of much interest and
value." Alfred Austin has also written a let
ter of appreciation and congratulation to the
author.
Among the books which the Century Com
pany will issue in November "Quotations for
Occasions" is perhaps the most unique. The
custom of using 1 appropriate quotations on
dinner menus, programmes, etc., and the fact
that not every one knows just where to turn
to find a citation for a particular purpose has
inspired Miss Katherine B. Wood, who had
charge of gathering the quotations for the
Century Dictionary, to make it. The reader is
warned in the preface not to be too sure that
the author of any quotation had In mind the
subject to which it is applied in the book.
When Ben Jonson wrote of "a dozen of di
vine points" he little thought how appropriate
It would be in connection with oysters ; nor
did Marlowe Intend "infinite riches In a little
room" to refer to terrapin; nor haa Shake
speare a bicycle meet in view when he wrote:
Will guÂ«rd your person While yon take your rest.
Ana watch your safety
in "The Tempest." ThÂ« book will prove of In
terest to the appreciative reader, whether he
has a dinner menu to prepare or not.

The Century for November onens the twenty
seventh year of the magazine with a series of
papers by General Horace Porter, entitled
"Campaigning With Grant," embodying recol
lections of Grant during the period of his su
preme command over the Union army. From
the first paper it will be seen that General
Porter's work will give an intimate revelation
of Grant's nature, and that it will be enlivened
by abundant anecdote. Two serial novels are
begun in this number: "Hugh Wynne, Free
Quaker," by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, is a story in
which Wynne, "sometime officer on the staff
of General Washington," tells, in the first per
son, the story of his life. The first install
ments give graphic pictures of life in Philadel
phia Just before the Revolution. The other
serial, by Marion Crawford, Is entitled "A
Roae of Yesterday"; the opening scene is in
Lucerne, and the characters are all Americans.
"Election Day in New York" is described in
much detail by Ernest Inirersoll, and is ac
companied by pictures by Jay Hambldge.
"The Olympic Games of 1896" is the subject
of a paper by their founder, Baron Pierre de
Coubertin, now the president of the interna
tional committee, and hid article is illustrated
by Andre Castaigne, whotaas sent to Athens
for the express purpose of making the pictures.
A suggestive and timely article is contributed
by Duncan Rose, son of a Confederate officer,
on the topic, "Why the Confederacy Failed,"
the three reasons given being, "The excessive
use of paper money," "The policy of dis
persion" and "The neglect of the cavalry."
"The National Hero of France, Joan of Arc,"
written and illustrated by Boutet de Monvel;
"The. Chinese of New York," by Helen F.
Clark, with illustrations by .Lungren and
Drake, and "After Brer Rabbit in the Blue
Grass," by John Fox Jr., are other papers in
the number. There are also short stories by
Chester Bailey Fernald, Lucy S. Furman and
Harry Stiilwell Edwards.
Harper's Magazine for November is an ex
ceptionally strong number. It contains as its
special features "Jameson's Raid," by Poultney
Bigelow; "The First President of the United
States" (fourteen illustrations by Howard Pyle
and others), byWoodrowWilson; "The Literary
Landmarks of Florence," by Laurence Hutton;
"The Dominant Ideaof American Democracy."
by Professor Francis N. Thorpe; "The Cuckoos
and the Outwitted Cowbird," by William Ham
ilton Gibson, and five short stories. The second
installment of George dv Maurier's "Tte Mar
tian" gives some delightful pictures of school
boy life in Paris in the last generation, with
the author's own illustrations. Tne other fic
tion Includes short stories by Thomas A. Jan
vier, John Kendrick Bangs, E. A. Alexander-
Octave Thanet and by a writer new to the
magazines, Miss Victoria Clement. The poems
of the number include "Feet of Clay" by
Louise Betts Edwards, "The interruption" by
Ella W. Peattie, and "Outward Bound," by
Edward N. Ponieroy.
The November Forum contains, among other
articles: "As Maine Goes, So Goes the Union,"
a trenchant article by the Hon. Thomas 1..
Reed, whose drift is perhaps suflicionily in
dicated by its title. Edward P. Clark under the
title "The Solid South Dissolving." contributes
an interesting study of the way in which the
South grew from normal division? into, solid
ity, and the way in which that solidity is now
disappearingâ a very timely and suggestive
papo r. E. W. Codi ing ton, a business man of Flor
ida, suggests a plan for placing our financial
system upon a sound basis. Dr. W. K. Brooks
oi Jobns Hopkins University, an eminent zool
ogist, writes on "Woman from the Standpoint
or a Naturalist," discussing in particular the
zoological aspects of female suffrage. W. K.
Stride in an article entitled "The Immediate
Future of Armenia," advances a very original
plan for solving the Eastern question.
Under the caption "Shall the Frontier
of Christendom be Maintained?" Mrs. Julia
Ward Howe discusses the same problem. J.
Gennadius, the distinguished Greek diplomat,
whose admirable series of articles in The
Forum, on recent archaeological discoveries
in Greece has aroused so much interest, con
tinues his recital with a brilliant and in
tensely interesting account of the exploration
of the Sanctuary of Apollo at Delphi, and of
the discoveryâ the most important yet madeâ
of original specimens of Greek music. Henry
D. Lloyd, in a study entitled "Emerson's Wit
and Humor," shows the Sage of Concord in an
entirely new light â that of a wit of the highest
order. The article fairly bristles with Emer
son's rare humor. William Ferrero, a rising
young Italian criminologist, and the author,
with Professor Lombroso, of "The Female Of
fender," contributes a thoughtful and sug
gestive paper, entitled "Work and Morality."
Professor Ferrero contends that the capacity
for methodical work is the rery essence of
morality â the quality upon which all others
depend. Professor Taussig, who occupies the
chair of economics at Harvard, writes very
plaln-spokenly about "Bond Sales and the
Gold Standard."
Godey's Magazine for November has a strong
election-time flavor, which will commend the
number to those even who are so much inter
ested in the campaign as to neglect magazine
reading this fall. Rufus R. Wilion's illustrated
article on "Conducting a National Campaign"
presents in a highly interesting way facts that
it is the duty of all citizens to be familiar with,
Decoration Composition Drawn for the Pittsburg Dispatch by E. H,
Blashfield.
and answers the important question so often
asked: "What becomes of the large sums col
lected every four years by the national com
mittees?" Under the title of "'We,' the Edi
tor," Frank C. Bray tells a lively story about
running a newspaper in a small city. This
glimpss behind the scenes makes "mighty in
teresting reading," and the' '.act that the
climax comes during an election adds timeli
ness. "In Quaint old Zoar" describes the
charming little Ohio settlement to which
Major McKinley has betaken himself for rest
during the campaign; and Mr. Lay's "Life of
Franklin." which nas met with a very cordial
reception, is continued in a very profusely
illustrated installment entitled "Franklin, the '
Politicien and the Statesman."
The November number of St. Nicholas be
gins a new volume of this magazine. The
leading feature is a serial, "Master Skylark,"
by John Bennett. This iÂ». a atory of Shakes
peare's time, and the great poet figures as one
oi the leading characters in it, although the
hero and heroine are a girl and a boy. The
opening scene is at Stratford duriug a visit of
the Lord High Admiral's players. The story
is full of action and of the romance of the
Elizabethan age. Another serial is also begun
in the number, "The Last Tnree Soldiers," by
Willard H. Shelton. Stories that are specially
addressed to girls are hard lo find, but the
first chapter of a short serial of this natufe is
printed. This is "June Garden," by Marlon
'Hill. Miss Hill is a young San Francisco
woman, who has written acceptably for St.
Nicholas before, and she Is a daughter of Bar
ton Hill, the Shakespearean acior and stage
manager.
The following stories appear in Harper's
Round Table for November: "Mr. Parks'
Obstreperous Sign," by Hayden Carruth (this
is a Halloween story and is full of humor);
"Texas," a tale of the early war troubles with
Mexico, by A. G. c&nfield; "My Adventures
With Dacoits," by David Gilmore; "The Boy
in War," by C. E. Sears; installments of
j Mollie Elliot Seawell's serial story entitled
| "A Virginia Cavalier," and of Hayden Car
rnth's serial story entitled "The Voyage of the
Rattletrap." There are the usual departments
of interscholastic sport, photography, bi
cycling, stamps, etc. The number also con
tains a sixteen-page supplement devoted to
descriptions of small select libraries which
are offered by the Round Table.
The Ladies' Home Journal for November
| contains, among, other good things, "Thanks
j giving Time in the Colonies"; "Conquering
I Race in Music," Mme. Emma Calve; "The
Vocal Stndent," Mme. Nellie Melba; "When

E. Richards.
Lilian Whiting writes in the November
Arena on Kate Field. Although within the
past few months much has been written and
said about that gifted woman Miss Whiting's
article is full of fresh interest. Being a life
long friend of Kate Field and knowing her
soul to soul, Miss Whiting, apart from tier
rare qualities as journalist and author, waa
singularly fitted to write her life and work.
A beautiful picture ot Kate Field, never be
fore printed, forms the frontispiece for the
article. The Arena closes its sixteenth volume
with the November number.
In McClure's Magazine for November the
reader's first curiosity will be for the widely
announced long story ot American life by
Rudyard Kipling. It opens on an Atlantic
"liner," passes dramatically to a Gloucester
fishing schooner on the Grand Banks of New
foundland and begins a portrnyal of the
strange romantic life of the Yankee fisher
men, in the midst of their perilous employ
ment, that promises to be as strong and flee as
anything Kipling has done.
Every whist-player will want to read the
article by Cavendish, the great English whist
expert, whose authority is a law unto so many
devotees of the game. In "What America
Has Done for Whist." la the November Scrlb
ner's, he acknowledges that from our sine of
the water have come several of the leading
principles of the modern game. It is a popular
paper in every sense. â¢
The article on "Woman Bachelors in New
York," In the November Scribner's, by Mary
Gay Humphreys, is written from the inside,
and describes the many ways in which liter
ary and artistic women get aloug in big
cities, where rents are so high and comforts
few. The illustrations show some typical
bachelor-girls' quarters.
Chester Bailey Fernald's stories in the Cen
tury Magazine have begun to attract wide at
tention. Several of them have been on Chi
nese subjeots; but a New England story, which
he will contribute to the November Century,
shows that he is as clever in down-east dialect
as he has proved himself in Pidgin- English.

THE VERY LATEST
DECREES OF FASHION
The demand for the latest designs and I
models increases daily, and it is quite im
possible to give tot much information on
such subjects, for those who cannot order
more than two or three gowns are quite as
anxious concerning their cut and style as
the matron who expects home a score of
toilets before the beginning of next month,
so I liave condensed the latest information
for your benefit and describe only such
powns and bodices as are worthy of your
special consideration.
Redfern is sending home daily costumes
we all may well sigh for, as behind their
air of stern simplicity is an indescribable
chic, as difficult to copy as it is to de
"scribe.
For instance, a dark-blue cloth dress is
traced with a design in a narrow black
silk cord, and is made with a short jacket,
cut in one with epaulets, showing nar
row revers of orange-colored velvet,
which turn back to reveal a pouched
waistcoat of caracule; open to the bust to
show a cravat of cream-colored lace. The
combination is delightful. Of a tabac
brown cloth is fashioned a second cos
tume.
The bodice fastens over at one side with
a narrow band of Astrachan. Gold and sil
ver and jet adorn this in front, and round
the armnoles and beading the fur, while
the belt and collar band are of geranium
red velvet. However, Mauby's creations,
which have caused the great sensation in
Paris and London, are certainly the der
nier cri. He makes the skirts of his tailor
gowns of the finest black cloth separate
from the silk lining, which is united at
the waist only, and for the boleTos he uses
a fine cloth of a brilliant red or blue shade
which is covered by braiding, so applied
that the color can barely show through, i
The result is charming and the skirt is al- i
ways lined (according to the iatest method) I
with silk matching the bolero ia color.
All the latest tailor sleeves are most mod
erate in size, almost but not quite like the
old coat sleeve.
Jlpt Lawns.
The accompanying illustrations are from
Liberty's. The standing models gown is
made of a green velvet hanging from tne
shoulders loosely to reveal a front of a
lighter green tinged with gray. It is
caught just below the bust with a laced
belt of green, traced with green beads,
while it is smocked at the neck with
another shade of green silk; the sleeves
are rucked to the wrist, and frills of tne
velvet, lined with green soft satin, fall
over the shoulders, the long yoke-lite col
lar, which is niched with the satin, being
also embroidered with the green beads.
Of creamy white Bengal satin is the even
ing gown illustrated, with an embroidery
of gold beads, amber-hued beads and
pale green bead-. There is a strong sug
gestion of the medieval about the shape of
this, the suggestion being further carried
out by the jeweled girdle and pendant ret
icule, while the sleeves, with their short
puffs and long bells, reaching almost to
the knees, are lined with the faintest
green.
A most stylish dress has been created
from a novelty canvas. It is bright violet
in shade and its bodice is of a thick
basket-work silk of a lighter violet color,
ano is covered with little groups of roses
which are on a white ground. It is full
to the waist at the back, with a tabbed
basque piped with violet velvet Violet
velvet also comprises the waistcoat, with
a chiffon and lace cravat falling to the
bust, and violet frills border the front of
the bodice, while straps of violet velvet
buckled with jet extend from the armhole
to the bust.
Fop a Visiting Costume.
An elegant visiting costume has a skirt
of a vioiet and black siik canvas and a
double-breasted bodice of violet velvet
fastened by four most beautifully enam
eled gold-mounted buttons and bordered
on the broad revers by light-toned mink
fur. The reversÂ» are turned back so as to
show a vest of exquisite point d'Angle
terre.
Princess dresses are daily gaining in
favor, and many leave the great dress
makers' hands now daily, and one of the
latest is made in a very light shade of
gray satin cloth, and has around the hem
a very broad band of fine Irish lace inser
tion, bordered on either side with a hem
of black velvet, which in its turn is edged
with a narrow band of marten. At the
neck there is a square of deep red veivet
studded with jewels, and over this, which
can be worn or dispensed with at will, is a
bolero of novel detail, square at the front
and the back, with epaulets, and
trimmed with black velvet and the Irish
lace to match the hem of the skirt.
Charming will one of fashion's leaders
look in a gown of violet vicuna dart and
rich in tone. The seams of the skirt are
trimmed with four rows of black velvet
baby ribbon, and the bolero is braided on
either side and has a vest embroidered in
green, pink, blue and purple harmoni
ously blended, and the waistcoat is made
of shirred velvet in a shade of dull water
green.
Combinations of .Materials.
On the very best authority I can assure
my readers that gowns "built of one
material mainly" are not the dominant
fashion, for I ha\Â»e information from Paris
direct that jaunty jackets, bodices and
blouses of a different fabric from the skirt
are to enjoy a great voÂ«ue. They are com
posed of velvet, brocade or ot some rich
silk, and, excepting when of brocade, are
usually enriched with embroidery or
beautiful hand braiding. I will describe
some of the latest models: An especially
attractive one is a short bodice of olive
green. Brocade lace is jaboted down the
front over a vest of canary-yellow taffeta.
Encircling both neck and waist are wide
satin ribbons matching the brocade. At
the waist line in the back they terminate
in a handsome bow.
A bolero, edged with handsome mink
and lined with the taffeta, adds much to
ttie air of chic. The sleeves fit closely to
just above the elbow, and then expand
into a weli-proportioned puff. With this
confection is worn a skirt of fine ecru
colored face cloth, which has a petticoat
of green taffeta, shading from green to
yellow; it is an altogether delightful pet
ticoat, and has an accordion pleated
ruffle, which consumed just five yards of
silk, but without that petticoat half the
style of the costume wonld have been
lost Observe how particular the fair
Parisian is in relation to details, and
therein lies her style and air, so fre
quently declared to be indescribable by
those not having the wit to analyze tue
i little things that mnst be combined if a
harmonious whole is desired. Many are
the women who will not grudge the best of
brocade and the choicest of mink for the
bodice, who will save on the petticoat,
when in reality they had far better go
without one of their numerous dresses
this season, and have each of their toilette
perfect in even the minutest particular.
Delightful indeed is ano her model
having a bolero of golden-i tied silk with
a brownish tinting; it is exquisitely
braided with a heavy silk Draid composed
of strands of dark and light brown silk
mixed with one of gold. The under wai3t
shews a front covered with soft, rich,
creamy lace applique, and encircling the
waist is a corsage oi the silk softly folded.
The skirt is of a handsome brown broad
cloth, which tones in perfectly with the
silk of the bolero. The sleeves are most
artistically shirred at the elbow, the puff
being very moderate. The cuffs are
braided and unusually pretty. The petti
coat accompanying this dress Is as elabo
rate in detail as the one I have just de
scribed, but a full ruffle of yellow lace
takes the place of the silk one, and is
a decided extravagance, for only a good
lace should be used, and it will prove un
substantial; a narrow frilling of the silk
completes it.
.Neat Velvet daeket.
The third creation that excited my en
thusiastic admiration was more conserva
tive, but not less worthy of considera
tion, for the smart jacket of steel-gray vel
vet is embroidered in black with rare skill
and indisputable taste. It is cut short and
can be worn either closed or open, but is
most effective when open, as the gray chif
fon ruffles, edged with black luce over
gray silk, make a stylish waist The skirt
of black satin cloth, when gracefully
raised, reveals a petticoat of gray taffeta
exactly matching the jacket. It has three
narrow ruffle?, each edged with black
Valenciennes lace and beaded with black
velvet. The jacket is lined with black
silk and the sleeves are the regular coat
sleeves, with just a suspicion of lullness.
They are covered with the embroidery. A

The article on "A Butcher in Featheis,"
which recently appeared in The Call,
gave one view of a common Californian
bird, and a view little likely to endear him
to the casual observer.
The bn;cher-bird is not, in reality, the
cold-blooded assassin that many writers
have made him out to be. Like all other
creatures of wood and sky and stream, he
is absorbed in the common struggle for
existence, and really does more good than
evil in the way oi keeping down the con
suming hordes of small life that would
otherwise prove a serious detriment to
the farmers' crops. The bird derives his
name, not, as is generally assumed, from
a murderous and wanton disposition, but
from his habit of haneing his victims
upon convenient thorns, twigs and
nooked branches. His food consists prin
cipally of mice, the larger insect?, small
snakes and slugs, and, while lie does at
times attack other birds, his enmity for
his own kind seems largely directed to
ward the English sparrow. The butcher
bird belongs to the shrike family. He
may be readily recognized by his colors, a
sort of bluish-gr&y above, with black wings
and tail, the latter being tipped with
black, and having a white patch at the
base, from which he has gained his other
name of "white-rumped shrike." He has
a characteristic flight, near the ground,
propelling himself straight forward with
a rapid flapping of the wings until near
home, when he makes a sort of quiet, up
ward spring, and climbs the air to bis in
tended perch.
Those who know him only as a fierce,
sanguinary feathered assassin may be sur
prised to learn that in the early spring

velvet, trimmed with black ostrich plumes,
gray gloves stitched with black and a tiny
bunch of California violets complete a
toilet that might be worn with a feeling of
satisfaction by the most perfectly gowned
woman in Ban Francisco. These three
examples from Paris direct are quite suffi
cient to prove that in spite or all fash
ion's desires issued six months ago con
cerning the banishment of the odd bod
ice it still flourishes, and will be in vogue
for the next six months at all events.
Bodices of Chiffon Lace.
Several of the evening bodices sent home
during the past week reflect credit on the
skillful designers, whose work certainly
compares favorably with any done in New
York. One dainty evening bodice is of
lightest yellow chiffon, with an abbrevi
ated bolero of pale-yellow velvet, em
broidered in jet, jet ornaments being
crossed at the bust and brought into the
waist. The basque is very full and made
of the chiffon, which has the appearance
of having been sprinkled with jet.
Ivory chiffon and black-thread lace
enier into the composition of a bodice
evolved for a bride who fully understands
how well she looks in black and white
The bolero is of black-thread lace, the
corselet and trimmings being of black silk
guicure, studded with wonderfully real
looking emeralds, which also appear to
hold in place the short, puffy sleeves of
white silK, veiled with the lace. The
skirt of white glace is draped in a truly
graceful manner, with an ancient shawl
of black-thread lace.
.Newest in Blouses.
B louses, some of the very latest, are be
ing made with the short elbow sleeves
exactly such as were worn during the
time of Marie Antoinette, and 1 am quite
charmed with one made of a white siik,
having a hair-like stripe of black. The
muslin fichu which adorns it is apparently
passed through small rhinestone buckles
at the waist line. Three of the narrowest
rows of ribbon velvet are in the frill of the
fichu. The bodice has a deep corselet of
black velvet, and on the left side of the
silk skirt are three bows of black velvet,
which increase in size as they reach the
hem. Most of us would admire a blouse
having a vest and collar of the most deli
cate green chiffon edged with frills of
creamy lace. Beneath the bust scarfs of
the chiffon cross and disappear into the
belt, edged with black velvet ribbon and

time, when mating is in order, the butcher
bird develops musical talents of no mean
sort Perched high in some tall tree, he
will sing by the hour to his ladylove, in
clear musical notes, something like the
song of the catbird of the Eastern woods.
John Burroughs declares that his voice is
"that of a savage, strident and disagree
able," but the genial naturalist has, like
most of us, small love for the shrike,
whose song has been admired of many
poets. Even Thoreau, that forest Â«eer,
whose ear was so sensitive to every dis
cordant note, speaks of the shrike "with
heedless and unfrozen melody, bringing
summer back again."
Out here in this gopher and ground
squirrel infested country, the butcher-bird
is really worth protecting. He makes
a meal now and then off a small bird,
but oftener the denizens of the ground
are bis prey. John Muir told me, some
time ago, of seeing a butcher-bird fol
low a young ground - squirrel into its
hole. Mr. Muir watched in amazement to
I see what the proceedings meant, and
presently saw the bird reappear, driving
before him half a dozen young ground
squirrels, which he dispatched and then
carried off one at a time. Doubtless he
impaled them somewhere, to return for

Ir. pale rose silk velvet is a bodice for
a slender matron. It is set in pleats from
the bust to the waist and shows a chemi
sette of the finest guipure, lined with rose
pink taffetas. The short sleeves are of the
guioure over silk. We will shortly see an- j
other in cut velvet; the ground is of
white satin and the colors are cerise,
mauvre and yellow. The back hangs sac
fashion in a pleat and the front is
fashioned also to set away from the figure

niched with white chiffon, while the |

of the new brocaded ribbons in green and

reveals a corselet, basque and chemisette cf
black chiffon richly incrusted with jewels.
Useful on many occasions is a bodice
| having a yoke of tucked black satin and a
deep, quaintly shaped collar of chine
patterntd velvet with infinitesimal stripes.
The sleeves are entirely made of the veivet,
and are trimmed with a border of mink;
it likewise edges the collar, which rests on
a thick frill of lace, lace again appearing
inside the high neckband.
Quite elaborate is a theater bodice of
aprie-green moire, covered with a design
in white. The yoke of white satin is almost
concealed by an incrustation of pearl and
gold beads. The bodice is made of the
moire.
A brilliant-hued geranium Sicilian silk
is employed for yet another, the yoke
being covered with an unusually good
lace; over the shoulders epaulettes are
formed of black satin loops; they also
trim the front and compose the basque
below tne waist.
A morning blouse, made of green silk,
bound with velvet and fastening with
velvet buttons, has the fullness so ar
ranged as to open over the embroidery

silks. Round the waist the silk is carried
in soft folds and the sleeves are ruffled at
the top. The collar is high' and plaited
and flares round the tnroat, a style becom
ing only to very long thin necks.
In London tea jackets are declared to be
indispensable, and one just noted at a
fashionable houne was of white satin, cov

intervals large jet stars embroidered on it.
The full back bodice and front were ad

Bepnljapclt's Gowns.
The immortal Sarah is assuredly a
most ingenious woman, for she has suc

that the "Dame aux Camelias," which
my little brothers of the air, I have not
seen a single butcher-bird this summer.
"I liave often wondered," says John
Burroughs, that tireless observer of birds,
"how this bird is kept in check. In the
struggle for existence it would appear to
have greatly the advantage of other birds.
It cannot, for instance, be beset with one
tenth of the dangers that beset the robin,
and yet apparently there are a thousand
robins to every shrike. * â¢ â¢ I seldom
see more than two each year, and before
I became an observer of birds I never saw
any."
A greater enemy to the songbirds than
the butcher-bird can ever be, and by far
more mischievous in field and orchard, is
the noisy, thievish, murderous, omni
present bluejay. If there is any bird in
California that should be given no quarter
this is tne creature. Even his unques
tioned beauty is not sufficient to redeem
his character in the eyes of any one who
has ever studied, his habits. He is quar
relsome, meddlesome, a bully and a thief.
He makes his way into the poultry-yard,
where he sucks the newly laid eggs, and
has even been known to kill and carry off
very young chickens. He hangs about
the nests of smaller birds and destroys and
devours eggs and young birds when the
parents are absent
The butcher-bird and the bawkare open
devourers. When the other birds see
them they run lor cover and are generally
able to keep out of harm's way, but they
are less able toeuard aga instthe sneaking
depredarions of the blue jay . They some
times do get the better of him, however

itntt it was the wish of the late Alexander
Dumas that the play should be mounted
in the costumes of the time in which the
"Dame aux Camelias" first fronted the
footlights. As a result Mile. Baylor makes
her appearance in the first act with a
truly marvelous pink and green poke
bonnet, and Mme. Grandet is an amusing
figure in organdy muslin, an antiquated
shawl and corkscrew curls.
Sarah's robe d'opera excited the en
thusiastic admiration of all the women in
the audience. It was composed of pink
silk gauze with festboned flounces, at
tached with pink feathers frosted with
diamonds. The mantle worn with this
lovely dress was a kind of stole of yellow
satin with large sleeves of zibeline.
The gown worn by her in the country is
delightful, being of watered velve* of the
lightest tone of Nile green, shaded with
silver, and over this is thrown a mantelet
of pink gauze. This mantelet, I assure
you, will enjoy a great vogue, as it is
strikingly becomincr, especially to women
of Bernhardt's style of figure. In the
fourth act her ballaress of exquisite lace
spangled with gold is caught np with
great bunci.es of white camellias, and in
the death scene a long, trailing robe of In
dia muslin it graceful and effective.
Sarah never wearies of telling every one
who asks that Doucet originated all her
costumes, and she is almost equally
I pleased with the sensation created by the
remarkable bonnets worn throughout.
One is in Italian straw, trimmed with
wavinc branches of lilac and Marechai
Niel roses, with bonnet strings of flowered
taffetas made sixty years ago. Another
"cabriolet" in heliotrope velvet with a
lopohore feather and a heliotrope bow is,
strange to say, very fetching. Naturally
these extraordinary bonnets, which are
I asserted to be reproductions from en
â¢ graving? and portraits of that period, will
I affect the fashions, and unique, odd
I cbapeaux will be the mode.

MEN`S
COWES JACKETS
GLOVES AND TIES
Several smartly dressed men have re
cently ordered suits of brown tweed, run
with a thread of green, which have proved
highly satisfactory. Him recently an
nounced:
"I have seen but few novelties in gloves,
but I can mention one which may be used
for afternoon dress. It is of thick chev
rette, of about the consistency of a driv
ing glove. The color is pure white, and it
has a certain style, but I would really pre
fer the brown or tan. The undressed kid
or SuecJe is as popular as ever, yet I think
that there will be some change by the
Horse Show. I bear that then many men
are going to try to do away with even
ing dress at night sessions of that func
tion. They allege that it is ou of place
at a horse show. I disagree with them, but
I think that there should be no evening
performance. A man bas but one dress
after candlelight â I am going back to the
among my trees. Evidently some mighty
disturbance was going on in the ornitho
logical world. Dressing hastily 1 hurried
forth, fieidglass in hand. A battle royal
was in progress between half a dozen
orioles, a bevy of Californian canaries and
two or three linnets, on the one hand, and
a single bluejay on the other. As might be
expected, the jay was getting the worst of
the encounter. Evidently he had at
tempted to despoil a nest, and the birds
had made common cause against him.
The orioles will frequently do this, not
only for themselves, but for other birds.
They seem to consider themselves the law
ful protectors of all small birds, as well as
of their own nests. They are strong,
courageous birds; as valiant as they are
beautiful and as chivalrous as the jay is
knavish.
But I confess to feeling sorry for the
solitary jay on this occasion. Beaten
down, his feathers broken and stained
with blood and dust, he lay upon the
ground watching his chance to escape.
Every time he moved a small bird would
rush upon him and drive him back to
earth. The orioles, perched high, evi
dently considered their part of the work
done and were merely guarding, as it
were, the attack of the light artillery.
Presently the jay, recovering strength,
essayed a low flight to covert Imme
diately the whole feathered vigilance
committee were in pursuit and chased
their victim â and this is to me the sin
gular part of it allâ until he had crossed
the fence "into an adjoining orchard.
Then they returned, triumphant, each
going his own way. I confess it taxes my
credulity to beiieve that the birds, intel

fashioned symphony or sonata â and that
there are hardly any circumstances which
can change that attire. In the daytime be
as horsey as you please."
Evening dress* or semi-evening drass is>
good form ; and, more than that, only
formâ if I may use the expressionâ after
candles are lit. ,Men of this period like
to appear as if they have just arrived
from the country, and disport themselves
in tweeds and short coats, when they
should remember that the rules of men's
dTess are inexorable and that one cannot
be too careful about them.
Tuxedos.
Dinner jackets, or Tuxedos, are so use
fnl and comfortable that every man who
pretends to dress owns at least one ot
them. They are made of a special cloth,
which has an elastic touch, but with a
noticeable thread. It has a roll silk col
lar; it is short and ronnded, and has two
pockets as frequently as it is made with
out any, but no breast pockets are allow
able. It is correct to wear it at the club,
at stag dinners and at home in the even
ing and to dinner at hotels or restaurants.
With it are worn patent-leather pumps,
black hose, a black satin tie, a black waist
coat and trousers matching the coat.
.Neckwear.
Men cannot be too particular about
their ties. They make or unmake a man,
and this winter the club tie will be in the
greatest vogue, for the turn-down collar
and butterfly bow are things of the past.
The club ties are obtainable in silks of
every conceivable shade, color and pat
tern. They are about one and a half
inches wide, and are arranged in a bow,
with square end 3. The best form are the
aark groand rcunchunda, especially in
blues, greens ana reds, with white figures.

Europe Ruled by Qermans.
It is a curious fact, with the excep
tion of the French royal lines (now prac
tically without a country), the Portu
guese and the Italian Princes, all of the
reigning families of Europe are Germans
or descendants of Germans. The Kings
of Austria, Denmark and the Princes of
the former Turkish provincesâ Servia,
Bulgaria, Greece and Eoumania â and the
Spanish princes are all German. The
present royal house of England is ot Ger
man origin, and, though the King of
Sweden is of French ancestry, the recent
ancestors of the family have been Ger
man.
Some Queer Superstitions.
In Ireland a belt of a woman's hair is
placed about a child to keep barm away,
and garlic, salt, bread and steak are put
into the cradle of a newborn baby in Hol
land. Roumanian mothers tie red rib
bons around the ankles of their children
to preserve them from harm, while Es
thonian mothers attttcb bits of asafetida
to the necks of their offspring.
Welsh mothers put a pair of tongs or a
knife in the cradle to insure the safety of
their children. The knife is also used
for the same purpose in some parts of
England. Among Vosges peasants chil
dren born at the new moon are sup
posed to have tongues better hung than
others, while those born at the last quar
ter better reasoning powers. A daughter
born during the waxing moon is always
precocious. At the birth of a child in
ligent as they are, recognized that fence
as a boundary-line, yet on no other
hypothesis can I account for their evident
satisfaction with the work they had done
and the immediate cessation of hos
tilities.

Opie Read's Diplomacu.
When Opie Read took charge of the
Little Rock Gazette many years ago i-e
was bitterly attacked oy a rival paper in
the neighboring town, Camden, Ark. He
bore this abuse in siience for several
weeks, but finally printed this paragraph
at the head of the "editorial jottings":
â¢'When Jim Simmons nrst settled in
Camden, years ago, he was poor, truthful
and honest. He is still 1 oor."
The next evening a tall, gaunt stranger
alighted from the evening train and ac
costed Opie, who chanced to be at the de
pot "watchin' of the train come in."
"Do you live here?" he queried.
"I do," was the answer.
"Come and have a drinlc then; I want
to talk to you."
The two men adjourned to a wet-goods
store near by, and after emptying their
glasses a few times the visitor casually re
marked:
"I've got to shoot a man in this town."
"So?" said Read, an inflection which
asked for more.
"Yepâ got to do it," continued the man
hunter. "Know anything about a paper
here called the Gayzette?"
"Say, let's have another drink. " hastily
interposed Opie. They did, and several
other drinks followed.
"Now, where's the Gayzette office T"
finally inquired the man from Camden.
"I want you to go along and see that I
get fair play. All you've got to do is to
point out the coyote that edits it, and
stand back out of range."
Together they started uptown toward
the newspaper office. The visitor never
reached it; there were too many saloons
along the route. And, strangest of all,
Opie several times lost his bearings and
took his belligerent protege through un
necessary detours and past more grog
shops than the Camderv editor ever had
seen before. An hour later the. man who
wanted uore was sleeping off an alcoholic
trance in a garbage-box in an alley. He
had lost his gun and the editor of the
Gazette hart secured a new paper weight.
It is unnecessary to add, perhaps, that
Opie was not shot that night. It is no
disparagement to him, however, to admit
that he was about half shot. â Chicago

Jhe. JVlearxing of Dago.
One day last week a man shouted "Dago"
at a party of men working on the streets
and immediately there was trouble, an
Italian worker in the group taking the
word as an epithet applied exclusively to
himself. Thirty or forty years ago, the
same cry would have provoked a melee
in which Scandinavian, German and sea
men of other nationalities would have
mingled. In those days "dago" was a
term synonymous with the objectionable
"rat," or one who takes' the place of a
striker in work requiring skill and expe
rience. Still, further barlr. in the begin
ning of the century, "dago" meant small
shopkeepers, "humboat" people, who
supply sailors with fruits, bread, butter
and other artie'es. â Pittsbnrg Dispatch.

COLOGNE, Holland. Oct. 14, 1896.â j
When the attractive lady, whose move- I
ments have been so veraciously chronicled
appeared one morning in the little Dutch
village tiil that moment sacred to paint
ers ihe was greeted by her triends with
what she felt was but a tempered enthusi
asm. She had taken a "run" up from
Paris, she informed them genially, and had
thought to give them a jolly surprise. If
a bird of paradise bad walked into the
chicken-coop in the back garden and had
wished to fraternize witu the decrepit
birds who brooded over their wrongs and
their eggs with an expression of the det \>
est melancbolv, the astoni>bment could
not have been more complete.
, "Why in tuÂ»> world did you come?" de
manded Mibs Verdantina Grey, whose de
votion to her work was as intense as it
was -new. "You'll be so uncomfortable, I
and you have not the compensations of j
art."
"Can't I Ret 'em?" asked Airs. White- |
na.t, anxiouely. "What shall I do to be j
saved?"
"It's not a disease," said Miss Ver
dantlna. with a suspicion of temper in her
voice. "1 warn you, you'll be miserable.
We haven't time to notice little discom
forts. We can't entertain you. There's
nothing to do. There are only three or
(our men. They all paintâ"
"I used to paint when I was a child,"
interrupted Mrs. Whitebat, "I used to
love it. I used to paint all the pictures in
my geography with colored chalk. Do
you know I've always thought I had a
talent for it. I was thinking about it in
Paris. * * * That's why I came!"
This brilliant conclusion seemed to
afford Mrs. Whitehat as much diversion
as it did us.
"Do you always have to have smudges
on your face to be a real artist?" she ques
tioned with that eager and serious look
which made her thirst for knowledge a
â  thing not to be laughed at or scorned.
"And I'm really ashamed to ask, but â but
â must â you â have all that magoo on tUe
front of your skirt?"
"I don't know what you call 'magoo.' "
said Miss Grey, with even more tartness
in her voice. "If you mean that I have
paint spots on my dress, I know it. You
can't be thinking of the beauties ot nature
and try to render tbem and keep consider
ing whether you've got a little paint
on your hands or skirts. I suppose you'd
go ont and paint just as you are dressed
now, because you'd be afraid to put on
unbecoming clothes! Why, you'd be
laughed at, all the little boys would ron
after you â "
Mrs. Whitehat was a picture to behold
as she glanced down with dismay at her
tailor-made gown, new and immaculate,
with flashes of silk in the lining. She re
covered in an instant, however, and rose
with dignity from the trunk on which she
had b o een sitting. She removed her pic
ture-hat, the chiffon scarf thai floated
under her demure chin, and asked to be
shown to her room at once. She had an
airof joyous determination about her that
made even Miss Grey pause and wonder.
An hour later she reappeared, and for
ah instant we failed to recognize her. She
would nave passed unnoticed any artistic
neighborhood in the worlds she might
have walked into the Hopkins Home un
chkllen cd. She had grasped, with a won
derful accuracy, the salient points of the
urystrc wardrobe. From what mysterious
corners of that Dutch peasant's bouse she
' Jhe Rotation period
It Of the Ev>er\ir\g Star
In the recent observations of the planet
Venus at Flagstaff, Ariz., which resulted
:nÂ°a determination of its rotation period,
no new discovery was made, but a very
important confirmation of a conclusion
reached some years ago by Schiaparelli of
Milan. As tnis conclusion differed from
all previous conjectures on the same sub
ject, and is founded on observations of a
difficult nature, the astronomical world
accorded it a qualified credence. To de
tect the rotation of a heavenly body it is
necessary that markings of some perma
nence be dijeerned and identified on
other occasions, tne position on the disk
being also accurately noted. The efful
gent surface of Venus is singularly elusive
in this respect. Being an inferior planet

She asserted it was all from her inner

\ tion of disorder That would have made her
fortune on the stage from its disheveled
masses; strings of it fell over her eyes and
ears. She wore a crumped shirt waist,
with a careless tie. Her skirt, which
seemed to be a little damp, was stained
and discolored, and hung longer on one
side than on the other; a bit of braid dan
dled from it. She wore a man's Scotch,
fore and aft cap, and. with a superb atten
tion to detail, a smudge of brown paint
ran from her cheek under her neck. There
was not a touch of exaggeration about her
costume.
This was a promising beginning, but the
next day it rained ! Mrs. Whitabat could
not bring herself to paint the model. The
models in question were two diminutive
women, of 6 and 8, with ragged clothing
and sticty white hair.
"If I could scrape them first !" the sug
gested.
So she read novels all day at the win

It rained for three days, unceasingly;
the vegetable gffrden was a mud patch;
tie fields were soaked; the dampness was
a thing to be felt.
On the morning 01 the fourth day Mrs.

glass of water, which she pointed at with
a tragic gesture.
"I held it up to the light," she groaned.

impressions of previous observers, com
menced v systematic &tudy of the surfaces
j oi Venus and Mercury, first with the 8-inch
and afterward with the 18-inch refractors
that have proved sucti successful searchers
of planetary detail. Aa a result he was
able to announce in 1889-90 that the rota
lion periods of both li.anets corresponded
nearly or perhaps exactly with the time
of their revolution. In case of Venus this
is 225 days, and it was also found that its
axis is perpendicular to the plane of the
orbit or nearly so. The accepted periods
of 'Si) 4 hours he classed as erroneous de
ductions, not even according with the ob
servations on which they are based, which
be found to be rather confirmatory of his
own conclusions. To the atmosphere of
Venus he attributed the variations noticed
by Bianchini, one of the early observers,
who assigned a rotation period of about
twenty-four days; w:.ile the earth's atmos
phere was held responsible for the blunt
ness of the cusps and the indentations of
the terminator. Finally this worthy suc
cessor of Galileo invites tbe renewed at
tention of observers to the southern por
tions of tbe planet where clear markings
sometimes appear, from which a more
accurate estimate of the rotation period
may be deduced, and also mentions the
occasional bright spots as real phenomena.
Unfortunately the daylight observations
of Venus at Mount Hamilton are rarely
satisfactory, but a brief series of observa
tions wit i the telescopes of Nice and
Mounier have been favorable to this inde
pendent theory. X ill, iike the Martian
canals, it met with opposition, notably
irom Trouvelat, who took observation at

This uniformity is often described as

difference in the result, as the lunar
brightness is not derived from the earth
round which it performs tthis twofold
motion, but from the sun, and conse

BaircTs Suggestions
For JMour\tairvGlirr\bir\g
After having climbed about every moun
tain and niSl around this City within a ra
dius of fifty miles that was worthy of the
effort I have come to the conclusion that
too much care cannot be exercised on the
subject of clotbinp. To come to a better
understanding on this subject let us con
sider the elements and obstacles that have
to be met.
To begin with, the heat of the journey, j
arising from the laborious ascent and the â 
rays of tbe sun if the trip is undertaken
in the daytime and on a sunny day. is
sometimes excessive. But, on the con
trary, the chill of the cooler atmospbereof
the summit should be provided for. A per
son could catch a dreadful cold by dropping
under a tree in a breeze and cooling off
suddenly. To provide apainst these ex
tremes a man should wear a pair of old
trousers of some thick, hard material. It
yon have such a pair reserve them jeal- |
ously for such occasions, as they are in- I
valuable, and for these reasons.
If they are of old material you will have
no compunctious in throwing yourself on
the ground anywhere if you get very tired.
For my part I have dropped in tbe middle
of the road on a blazing not day on Diablo
at the only piece of shade anywhere in
sight. If they are of hard material they
will resist the briars and thorns when you
leave tbe beaten tracks. Such material is
very likely to prove cool in hot weather
and warm In cool â strange as it may seem.
Mine are so, at any rate. This is a most
important consideration when you cannot
very well carry on your back a knapsack
lull of changes of raiment. Remember, a
thin pair of trousers are most likely to
tear; and moreover, you are very liiely to
catch cold at the first sudden change. The
coat should, as far as possible, be in keen
ing with what I have just said. The shirt
should be of flannel and not too thick.
The hat bad better be of the slouch order,
soft, with plenty of small holes in tbe
crown. Btraw does very well, But it is not

The Rhine steamer leaves at nine.
It wa3 a beautiful morning; the sun
light made the river almost intolerably
bright; the steamer was gayly decorated
with flags and was already crowded with
people when we reached the landing.
We found seats at last, and with shrill
whistles and toots we started. Then we
glanced at our fellow-travelers. A young
man and a young vroman on one side,
most evidently on their wedding journey.

through the extensive atmosphere of
Venus. Conjecture is vain as to the cause
of this mysterious gleam, as the atmos
pheric conditions of the planet are too
complicated for plausible theory.
One peculiarity of this mode of rotation
is that tbe evening star always presents
the bame terminator and its adjacent
lunes to view, and the morning phases
present the opposite side of the di-k,
while both include the central parts like
tbe evening and morning moon.
In July last, when Venus emerged from
the Bun's obscuring rays after superior
conjunction, it was nearly round in form
and its silvery disk as unreadable in tbe
average telescope as the much-talked-of
silver bullion before it is coined. Even
now, though much nearer to tbe earth, it
is far from the most favorable position,
and only exceptional conditions reveal
the shadings. These no doubt were ob
tained at Flagstaff, and, combined with
previous investigations, formed v chain of
evidence confirming tbe assigned period
of about 225 days.
Thus modern skill and perseverance has
succeeded in penetrating the dense at
mospheric veil that perplexed telescopic
scrutiny for nearly three centuries.

Shoes are the most important part of a
mountain climber's outfit. 111-fitting foot
gear can do more to untit a man fora long
tramp and a pleasant time than anything
I know of. This subject has been a
specialty with me for years, and I will
take the public in my confidence. Above
all things your shoes should be tried and
seasoned. No matter how many patches
there may be on them, so long as they fit
well and are practically sound they will
fulfill tbe requirements.
Choose an old pair of shoes, even if they
have been cast aside, as long as the uppers
are in fairly good comlition they will do.
Take them to a shoemaker, tell bin what
you expect to do with them. Have him
half bole and heel them, put patches on
the cracks and sew them. Tell him not
to mind appearances, but to do his work
thoroughly. After this try your shoes on,
and if they are at all loose cut out a pair
of pasteboard insoles carefully; they will
mase the feet fit snugly and absorb the
perspiration.
Another matter of preparation is of con
siderable importance. For two days be
fore a tramp do not drink any more water
than you can possibly help. If you can
abstain entirely and not drink a swallow
for twenty-four hours before you will be
much better off. It may not be generally
known, but a person in good health can
abstain from liquids of. apy kind for a
week without danger or weakness. Dr.
Tanner fasted absolutely for one week and
then continued for thirty-three days more
on water only. The more water you pour
into your system the more you will sweat,
and the more you sweat the more uncom
fortable you will be. There may be ex
ceptions to the latter rule, but they are
rare.

THE BRIDE WHO READ ALOUD.
In spite of the intense heat I felt during
the laborious ascent, caused by the heat
of the sun and the heat of my biood com
bined, I did not once wipe my face with
the many handKerchiefs brought for ti at
purpose. But tbat was not all: there was
absence of intense thirst that surprised
me. I have given the reason of the ab
sence of perspiration; the indifference to
thirst was accountable by two things:
first, I kept my mouth closed as much as
possible, excluding dust and preventing
my tnroat from drying. Again, I have
been endeavoring for some months now to
drink as little as posMb.e. 'For one who
takes exercise I believe this is the proper
course â providing, of course, tbat you live
properly â tout for one of sedentary habits,
and particularly those quite closely con
fined, tbe other course may be advisable,
to keep tbe system flushed.
A comical incident occurs to me that
illustrates the habits of some people.
Talking to a young man concerning diet
I remarked: "A person in training should
not drinK water while preparing for a race,
as it increases the perspiration and heats
the vitals during the struggleâ both of
which are to be avoided."
"Oh, I rarely drink water," responded
he; "in fact, I hardly drink any at all."
I looked ct him and thought, "Why, diet
ing in training should be child's play to
one who has bis appetites under such con
trol." But my reflections were cut short
by tbe young fellow continuing earnestly,
"I only drink beer."
Now it frequently happens that water is
scarce on the mountains, so it is advisable
to carry something to drink. There are
two ways that this can be done to the sat
isfaction of tbe mountain climber. One
of these is to carry an army canteen slung
over the shoulder â on the shady side if
possible. These are equipped with a cov
ering of felt. After the canteen has been
filled and corked it should be dipped in
tne water and tbe felt thoroughly soaked.
The evaporation of this water will bave
the effect of cooling the water within.
Once during a walk to San Jose with a
company of the National Guard I rilled
and soaked my canteen as described, and
although the weather was very warm I
was agreeably surprised io find bow cool
the water was when, hot and thirsty, I
sat down to drink.

Every one has seen trie Rhine, except a

Suffice to say that for the first hour, the

controlled. After this tbere were shad

acter; she was so frank and aboveboard in

peated Verdantina.

did not entor into the contest, and any
man who considered himself qualified to
run entered the lists for office. There is
no record of any convention, and tbere
were from three to six candidates for each
office. The election was spoken of for
years afterward as the "steeplechase."
So little regard had previously been
paid to the proper names of persons that
until the election some were known only
by nicknames. Thus, tbe gentleman who
had conferred upon him the inelegant
alias of "Tom Snook" emerged from the
contest as A. H. Broder Esq., Sheriff of
Alameda County. >
The first officers of the county were: A.
M. Crane, County JuJge; A. N. Broder,
Sheriff; William H. Combs, District
Attorney; A. M. Church, County Clerk;
J. 8. Marston, Treasurer: James S. Wat

of A. M. Church was electe i Supervisor.

'"Ah, that Bounds,' indeed said the joy
fully surprised, 'exactly as the song winch
a poor captive knight in the nortn tower

neighborhood.' With thesa words the
maiden sprang away."
"I don't^ tink," said Mrs. Pearlpowder,
doubtfully, "tbat that was the Lorelei,
"i tink dis rock now coming is her."
Mrs. Whitehat regarded her with deep
indignation. To have wasted her senti
ments upon a commonplace rock was
maddening.
The children on our left now began to
clamor for food and, baskets being pro
duced, they were soon talking again with
their mouths full of apple and bread and
jam. Every other moment one or the
other would precipitate himself upon the
melancholy gentleman with the news
paper and drag him reluctantly to see
sjme view. The smallest hopeful, in a
saildr dress, insisted upon climbing up
Mrs. Whitehat' s sleeve with jam my
fingers to investigate her hat, upon which
several bunches of cherries bobbed in the
breeze. The fond mother reproached the
chile mildly, and Mrs. Whitehat moved
as far as she could, but the attractions
wera too alluring and soon the little
darling was pulling off the cherries and
eating them blissfully.
"I feel like a murderer," said Mrs.
Whitehat, "but I do hope they'll have an
almost instantaneous fatal effect."
With reproachful glances at Mrs. White
hat, the mother warded off that catas
trophe, and the baby shrieked with ear
piercing yells into that irate lady's ear.
The poodle barked furiously, and there
' were strained relations for the rest of the
day.
The little bride continued to read aloud,
the pearl powder lady continued to give
us her impressions as to the scenery and
to correct them later on. The dear little
boy asked questions over and over again,
and punched his mother to attract her at
tention. The melanchoiy gentleman fell
asleep behind his paper, and the sun
burned the skin from our noses. Broken
bits of conversation floated to us in this
wise. It was all so romantic.
"Just think, dear," murmured the bride,
"this is St. Goar, and the guidebook says
it is 1300 years old."
"Didn't grow as fast as Chicago, did
it?" said the young husband, looking at
the gray little village with most open con
tempt.
On we steam past the Rudesheim, where
the sun glitters in the wings of the noble

mendous fortresses; past the gloomy
ruined towers of Roland's castle, and tbe
little bride reads the legends of the Lorelei

impregnable tower, black and terrible,
haunted by bis restless spirit. It is im
possible to shudder with horror: for that

our sentiments another verse of that too

A Tbpe Ikcident is thi Histoby of the
Great North Stab Property.
Johnny Wilson's father and mother
were pioneers, for they had journeyed
across the plains as members of almost
the first caravan of emigrants that started
for California from lowa, which was very
soon after the discovery of gold in the
former State, or at least as soon as the
news bad reached the East.
The Jong line of oxen, covered wagons,
heavily laden mules and horses, besides
the men, women and children, bad trav
eled many hundreds of miles west of the
great Missouri River, far from home and
friends, when an attack from Indians was
threatened. These Indians bad pursued
tnem for many days, and now were very
close on their track. But, thanks to a
kind Providence, they were able to reach
the mountains, and could defy the attacks
of the red men, who, upon seeing how
sturdy the men, and bow alert, as well as
that they were exceptionally well armed,
after a few futile attempts to gain posses
sion of some of the livestock belonging to
the emigrants, disappeared in search of
a less vigilant train.
It was this pursuit after cold, and espe
cially the trouble with the Indians, that
first drew together the young man and
woman who afterward married and be
came the parents of my story.
He bad been particularly alert and
courageous during the perils of the long
journey, while the young jiir! was beloved
by all for iier unfaiLng efforts to encour
age and sustain the frightened women.
Ah, those were the days when the 'oul
of women and men were sorely tried!
when d ath ntared the traveler in the face

foes without mercy, whose delight waste
torture the men to death and to inflict on
the captive white women a horrible slav
ery worse than death.
But the story of that eventful journej
would take too much space if I should trj
to relate it now.
However, all the dangers were at lasi
overcome, and early in the spring of 1841
the train reached Sacramento and it;
members separated into groups and fami
lies some of them never to meet again.
The two young people in whom we an
interested were here married, and, lik<

and that all dangers and joys would b<

mine.
After long study and with the full con
currence of his wife, he purchased a prom
ismg claim in Nevada County, near the
present city of Grass Valley.
There Johnnie was born about two years
afterward, and there he lived, happy as
the day was lonr, until he reached the age
of 10. The intervening years had passed
brightly and quickly for the Wilsons,
the devotion of the husband being re
v?itr led by the supreme affection of the
wife. Work on the mining claim had been
steadily j rosecuted, and the labors of the
industrious owner had been rewarded by
the uncovering of an occasional pockei of
ore which sometimes yielded well, encour
aging him to renewed efforts.
But alas! a dark day camel A loosened
timber fell upon Mr. Wilson one day while
he was at work and crushed one of his
feet. A ion- season of suffering and in
action was the result, and months after
ward bis physicians wer-> forced to tell
him it would never perfectly heai, and
that his days of active mining were over.
Troubles increased ; money became scarce ;
then the brave little wife was obliged to
take upon herself the sole support of the
family.
Without complaint, for she was a true
pioneer, she tooK uo the heavy burden.
Mr. Wilson's inability to work made
him extremely irritable, although he
never complained to his heroic wife.
He meditated often on the thought if
he could sell his mine for just what it had
cost him he might be able to enter some
business that would be congenial as well
as profitable, notwithstanding his im
paired physical condition.
So he and bis wife, after considering the
subject, decided to dispose of the claim.
Bat men of capital kept away, busy
â¢elsewhere, and the opportunity to s*ll did
not present itself for many months.
One day, when the resources of the
family had reached almost their lowest
ebb, two strangers called at the house and
stated that they were buying mines and
were looking for a good prospect. "Would
Mr. Wilson care to sell?"
The miner unswered "yes" and stated
his price, while the light of hope shone
brightly in his eye.
An examination of the mine followed
and the men :eft, but returned again and
again during the next few weeks.
Finally they approached the subject of
tbe consideration to be given, and offered
Mr. Wilson just one-quarter of the price
he had named.
AlthouL'h sick at heart, and knowing
how much he needed money, he indig
nantly refused. The men took their de
parture, leaving tne address of the hotel
at which they would be for ten days.
Money grew scarcer and scarcer, the
disgrace of being in debt stared them in
tbe face; no better prospect offered itself,
and at last, despairingly, a note vas ad
dressed to the would-be purchasers accept
ing their offer, and designating the time
and place for completing the transaction.
Johnnie was the nearer of the note
whose writing had caused so much of sor
row, and was dispatched to Nevada City
in the care of a kimi neighbor.
The bashful boy entered the hotel where
tbe men whom be had come to see were
stopping and sat down to await their com
ine.
He knew of the trouble in t c home, and
â¢â  had mourned in secret the sorrow .of his
parents, but he was of pioneer stock and
bravery was a natural heritage.
Now, it so happened that the very men
â¢ were sea.cd at a tab'e in a far corner of the
room and had been unnoticed by Johnny.
Ol cou^e they paid nol the least attention
to the mite of a boy, who was sitting look
in? out of one of the large windows at the
1 passing scents of the street.
The men were discussing their proposed
â¢ investments, when one of them in an un
; guarded moment and with bis voice raised
| above the ordinary pitch, remarked: "If
But In the realm of (ioboilnk
Things cinip by chance, you know,
And sonff there are wouM have us think
This world was peopled so.
Who will name it and compose a little rhyme

And bedecked ea h other with bearded hay.
"Let's play We're at the daice." one said;

â H. B , Oakland.
iWe could only buy that W Â«>n rlairo we
â¢hould be iu-..1" Johnny listened, but
did not move a mii-cie, ne was so astou
ished.
"That man little knows what lies under
that lame foot of his!"
"Yes; they sureiy .-ire talking about
father," thought the boy.
"Yes," responded the other; "and we
shall buy it yet! You will see. Why, the
j family are actually starving, I hear.
I Wouid it not be a good idea to go up to
I him with the gold? He couldn't reTuse
j then, I'm sure."
"No; we needn't trouble; he'll never
discover that vein. Just tnink, only to
dig four feet more and grasp a fortune!"
Johnny, who had been born and bred
I among miners and knew all the peculiar
phrases and terms employed by them,
grasped the purpose of the speculators at
once. '"Only four feet more," he repeated,
y over and over again to himself. ''Oh, if
j father was only here!" He hardly knew
| what to do. He thought awhile â "Ought
he to give the men the note over which
bis father ana mother had cried so hard?"
"I shall tell father first what I have
ust heard," was his final conclusion, and
he started right away for his home.
To relate to you Johnnies reception,
and how a furth< r exploration of the mine
revealed k vein of astounding richness
only a few feet below where work on the
shaft had been stopped, and how John
nies father was paid $500,000 for the mine
he had so nearly sold for $2500 would be
quite superfluous.
Fortunes were taken from this same
mine, and millions of dollars were paid
out in dividends to its stockholders. It is
still one of the createst and richest of
California's great mines, and is kno.vn to
every one us the "North Star of Nevada
County."
Johnnie, his father and his mother are
alive tc-dav. Their home is famous in
our fctate as one of the most beautiful
within its borders, and Joannie is one of
our great banKers, and is morally and
physically a tyi>o of the true native son

There was ones an old monk who was
walking through a forest with a little
scholar by his side. The ola man sud
denly stopped and pointed to four plants
close at hand. The first was beginning to
peep above the ground ; the second had
rooted itself pretty â¼'ell into the earth;
tde third was a small shrub; while tlie
fourth and la t wn-s a full-sized tree. Then
the old monk said to his young com
panion :
'â¢Pull up the first."
The youth easily pulled it up with his
fingers.
"Now pull up the s cond."
The youtu obeyed , but not so easily.
"And the third."
But the boy had to put forth all his
strength and use both arms before he suc
ceeded in uprooting it.
"And now," said the master, "try your
hand upon the fourth."
But, lo! the trunk of the tall tree
(grasped in the arms of the youth) scarcely
snook its leaves; and tne little fe.low
found it impossible to tear its roots from
the earth.
Then the wise old monK explained to
his scho'ar the meaning of the four trials.
"This, my son, is just what happens
with our passions. When they are young
and weak one' may, by a littie wa:chful
ness over self and the help of a little
seif-denial, easily tear them up; but,
if we let them cast their roots
deep down into our souls, then
no human power can uproot them â the
almighty hand of the Creator alone can
pluck ttem out. For this reason, my
child, watch over the first movements of
your Boul, and study by acts of virtue to
keep your passions well in check. 11 â Se

In the evenings we often took puppy
i for a run on the street He could not go
! far away from us, fur fear of the pound
i man, but he could run and chase and
: have a loveiy time.
He always mistook a certain man for
j George, and would run after him, making
I me very much out of patience with him,
I and one time I had to carry the heavy
j fellow all the way home to get him there
!at all. After that I never went walking
I with p.uppy in the evening.
I remember how I laughed the first
| time he ever saw a cow. ShÂ» was staked
\ in an unfenced lot with a long rope.
Puppy went a^ cioÂ«Â« to her as he dared
! and stared at her. Then he looked at me
! to see if this strange monster frightened
I me. He walked around to the other side
and sit clown again. He looked long at
her horn^ and her flapping tail.
Bossy- took no notice of him; she was a
kind old lady cow, used to all sorts o' doas.
She saw a bunch of tine-looking grass over
by Puppy and started for it. How that
dog aid run ! I had to call him back. He
â¢ stood close to me till he noticed the rope.
Tnen he knew the cow could not run after
him. Standing just far enough away that
he was out of her reach he began to bark.
Kound and round he ran, calling her all
sorts of names and daring her to catch
him. I could hardly drag him away.
The next time we went walking he in
sisted upon goin : that way again, but the
cow was not there.

j Saving on the Deep
Shaped Like a Torpedo and Run by "Elec
tricity or Spring, Bracing Hea^y Surf
The latest device for communication
between a ship in distress and shore is a
cigar-shaped electric boat. As the New
York Herald declares the great difficulty j
which life-savers have had to contend
with has been that of getting a line from
the shore to the ship. Often the only !
means is tne mortar, and when this fails
the life-savers are obliged to stand by and
see the crew perish without being able to
render them any aid.
It is to overcome this and afford the life
savers an opportunity to wort in any kind j
of weather, and under any conditions.jthat
this new lifecar is made.
It was at first proposed by the inventors
that this car should only carry the life
line, but as their experiments demon
strated tbe feasibility of the plan, the in
terior construction of the car was changed
so as to accommodate passengers. In
construction the car resembles the cigar
shaped Whitehead torpedo. It is pointed
at one end, while at the other there is a
propeller and rudder. On either side of
the Q/aft, near the front, are two paddle
wheels, which are intended to aid the
propeller and also serve the purpose of
keeping the craft in a proper position
while in the water. The motive power is
supplied by a motor which is placed in the
forward end of the craft. When carried
iby ships the lifecar is suspended from
l davits, in the same manner as au ordinary
lifeboat
Either electricity or a spring motor can be
used as a motive power. If electricity is
used, storage batteries are placed in the
hull of the craft and connection made
between them and the gearing which runs
the propeller and tbe paddle-wheel's mo
tion is transmitted by bevel gears acting
upon tUe propeller shaft.
The direction of the craft is controlled
by means of a stationary rudder formed
of two blades set at right angles, so that
it can be steered even if by any possibility
the craft should turn on its side while in
the water.
Well aft in tho body of* the craft is a
larga drum or reel, on which is wound a
long cable, one end of which passes out
through the top of the car and is made
fast to the ship. As the car travels
through the water the line pays out, and
so the car is in constant communication
with the ship.
Fixed to tbe bottom of the car or boat is
a clawlike anchor hung on a half hinge,
which allows it to work backward against
the bottom of the boat, but prevents it
from turning forward. The idea of this )
is that when the craft strikes shallow
water tbe anchor will dig into the sand
or catch on the rocks and prevent the
boat being washed back from the sbore
by the action of wind or waves.
To still further prevent any possibility
of the car being driven off shore the pad
dle-wheels are pointed and slightly
curved, so that as they revolve in shallow
water they will catch the sand. A wheel
or roller is placed beueath the car at the
stern, which allows the craft to be drawn
up on the shore. All of the machinery is
placed In the bow, thus leaving sufficient
rooiÂ»>at the stern for the accommodation
of a limited number of persons.
In order that the position of the car may
be indicated at night a large colored light
is fixed near the bow, and when electrictiy
is the motive power it also serves to light
the lamp. It is tightly closed and can
pass safely through heavy seas.
If by any chance the car should turn on
its side while going through the water it
might be unpleasant for the occupants,
but it need not interfere with the progress
of the craft, nor would it injure those in It
beyond a general shaking up. The pecu
liar construction of the rudder, and'side
wheels makes it possible to steer the craft
in any position, even if it should turn
upside down.
When used as a means of transferring
persons from the stranded ship to the
shore this lifecar has many advantages
over the breeches buoy. Its occupants
are fully protected from any chance of a
wetting and the number carried on each
trip iB limited only by the size of the car.
It can be guided either by the occupants
SOME EARLY MORNING SIGHTS AND SCENES ALONG THE CITY WATER FRONT
Have you ever been down on the water
front and seen the day break? If you
have, you know all about it, but if you
haven't you have missed one of the sights
of California. And be it said, a Biebt that
comparatively few of the State's citizens
ever witness.
San Francisco is one of those peculiarly
situated cities that commences to wake
up at the end tbe sun strikes first, which
being the eastern end is not remarkable
aUehall. When the people of the West
ern Addition are still sound asleep, with
intention of rising for several hours,
the water front is bustling with life. In
fact the water front hardly gets to sleep
before it commences to wake up again, and
at this time of the year that is long before
the eastern sky shows signs of light.
Daybreak on the water front, however,
is not an exhilarating sight, even to those
Anxiously Awaiting His Ship's Boat
lovers of nature who see beauty in every
thing. It is likely to be depressing and
cause a feeling of melancholy. To walls

What Is ar\ /Uom ?
It is strange that great scientists should j
allow a little thing like an atom to bother
them, but they do. A recent writer has
given it as his opinion that theffe is no
other department of scientific research
which shows so strikingly man's tremen
dous ignorance of nature as this bit of in
finite minutia.
It is freely admitted that tbe most pro
found and diligent research has failed to
develop anything like adequate knowledge
j as to what the little atom really is.
What he does is another matter. Long
and learned disquisitions have been writ
ten about thatâ how it is his tremendous
activity under the influence of heat that
moves the engine, the little atom beatiDg
against the piston and so driving it for
ward.
The atom, however, is not dependent
upon heat for its activity, for it keeps up
a most exciting game of tag, even in the
more constrained limits of a cold piece of
iron. To be sure, our dull senses are un
able to discover the fact. Neither our sight
nor our touch reveals it
But if our organs were several million
times more acute they would be able to
distinguish a constant upheaval in what
otherwise appears to us a solid, immova
ble substance.
The individual molecule, however, has
large room for exercise in the small spaces
away down beyond our sense of touch.
Lord Kelvin says tbe atom is quite
measurable â it) not too small to be capable
of having its exact dimensions fixed by
figures. And by way of illustrating what
his figures mean he says that if a drop of
water were magnified into the size of this
j globe of ours and the atonrs that compose
it were magnified of course in proportion
the atom would appear somewhere be
tween the size of a shot and the eize of
a cricket ball.
"Four lines of argument," he says,
"founded on observation, have led to the
conclusion that atoms, or molecules, are
not inconceivably, not immeasurably
small. 1 use the words 'inconceivably'
and 'immeasurably' advisedly/ Tnat
which is measurable is not inconceiv
able, and therefore the two words consti
tute a tautology. W T e leave inconceiva
bleness, in fact, to metaphysicians. â¦ â¦ â¢
The general results of the four lines of
j reasoning to which I have referred,
founded respectively on the undulatory
theory of light, on the phenomena of con
tact electricity, on capillary attraction
and on the kinetic theory of gases, agree
in showing that the atoms or molecules of
ordinary matter must be something like
the 1-10,000,000 or from the 1-10,000,000 to
the 1-100,000,000 of a centimeter in di
ameter."
And here is Lord Kelvin's confession
concerning the atom :
"The chemists do not know what is to
be the atom ; for instance, whether hydro
gen gas is to consist of two pieces of mat
ter in union constituting one molecule,
and these molecules flying about, or
whetner single molecules, each indi
visible, or at all events undivided,
in chemical action, constitute the struc
ture. I shall not go into any such ques
tions at all, but merely take the broad
view that matter, although we may con
ceive it to be infinitely divisible, is not in
finitely divisible without decomposition."
Whether we can divide pieces of glass
into pieces smaller than the hundred
thousandth of a centimeter in diameter
and so on without breaking it up, and
make it cease to have the properties ol
glass, just as a brick has not the property
of a brick wall, is a very practical ques
tion.
Absolute continuity distinguishes mat
ter and space as it distinguishes time.
Moments, the atoms of time, can be
divided infinitely, so, also, he says, space
may be, but molecules of matter, he thinks,
reach a point in their division where they
lose their qualify.

properties â in the atom that has opened
to them wide fields of interesting specu
lation.
"The now well-known kinetic theory of
gases," says Lord Kelvin, "is a step so
important in the way of explaining seem
ingly static properties of matter by mo
tion, that it is scarcely possible to help
anticipating in idea the arrival at a com
plete theory of matter in which all its
properties will be seen to be merely attri
butes of motion. If we are to look for the
origin of this idea we must go back to
Democritus, Epicurus and Lucretius.
We may then, I believe, without missing
a single step, skip 1800 years."

"a surest rticle of faithâ the kinetica
theory of gases."
Rich as it is in practical tesults, the
kinetic theory of gases, as hitherto de
veloped, stops absolutely short at the
atom or molecule, and gives not even a
suggestion toward explaining the proper
ties in virtue of which tbe atoms or mole
cules mutually influence one another. For

Successful Motor Vehicle.
The citizens of Paris recently had an op
portunity of seeing a small three-wheeled
automobile vehicle skimming over the
ground, evoluting with ease amid an en
tanglement of horses and carriages, and
disappearing in a crowd of passers-by
without any more noise than that made
by burned pases. The apparatus was the
invention of Leo Bolle of Mans.
The vehicle has traveled over 2500 miles,
and has been driven at the rate of eighteen
miles an hour.
The aspect of the Bolle tricycle is that
of a low and long wagonette, quite pleas
ing to our eyes, which are as yet unaccus
tomed to such apparatus of locomotion.
The slight elevation of the vehicle gives it
a perfect stability, since its center of
gravity is situated at but sixteen inches
done the same thing at the same time for
many years. Then comes another and
then another. Bums wake up from be
hind lumber piles, or crawl out fTom'un
der the wharves. The night watchmen
get out of the heavy blanket overcoats,
that have kept them warm during the
long hours of darkness, and hurry home
to bed. At this time many familiar
characters make their appearance. Then
come the firemen of the steamers, the
vegetable peddlers and longshoremen.
The first man to appear on the water
front in the early morning.except of course
the police, is old Benny McLean. He
usually comes on before daylight, shuf
fling along with his hands in his pockets,
skirmishing for a breakfast. The most
tempting thing that could be offered
above the surface of the ground. The
stability is further increased by the rela
tive width of the basal triangle (3:6x4 leet)
and by the position of the steering wheels
in front. The elongated form of the tri
cycle, which js very conducive to speed,
gives it a vague resemblance to a torpedo
boat, and whoever has seen it shooting
along at thirty miles an hour upon a level,
and at twenty-seven upon gradients, will
recognize the fact that the name of "road
torpedo - boat" is fully justified. The
vehicle, in running order, weighs 350
pounds.
The motor is a gasoline one of four revo
lutions, as usual. It has out one cylinder,
and that of very elongated form, in order
that the expansion shall be as complete as
possible. The burner is so combined that
the flame shall return upon itself in a
reverberatory.
The carbureter is the classic apparatus
of Messrs. Panhard & Levassor. It will be
remarked upon inspecting the motor that
a practical mind has combined all its
parts, has placed all the valves, for ex
ample, within reach of the band.
The person who sits in front does
not aid in the steering of the vehicle. The
steersman sits behind, his feet resting on
each side upon a platform provided with
a straw mat. He merely has to move his
foot backward in order to press the lever
of a powerful brake, whose block is tan
gent to the circumference of the driving
wheel. With his right hand he steers the
vehicle through a hand wheel, which, by
a very simple gearing, turns the fore
wheels to the right or left; the steering,
in fact, being done as in the Olympia tri
cycles used tj^ree or four years age. With
the left hand he holds an almost vertical
lever, which permits him with a few
motions to effect several important ma
neuvers.
If he pushes it forward he tautens Ihe
driving belt andi consequently, starts the
vehicle aa soon as the motor has been set
in operation through a winch, according
to the well-known process. If, in the
median position of the lever, he turns tbe
handle to the right or left he throws the
motor into gear into one or another of the
three speeds. Finally, if he pulls the lever
backward, he loosens the belt and conse
quently suppresses the transmission and,
at the same time, presses the brako-b'ock
against the driving wheel.
Upon the whole, this tricycle does not
constitute an invention, but, rather, a
combination of happy arrangements of
inventions that are already Known. We
may add that it carries a supply of gas
oline sufficient for a trip of seventy-two
miles, that it may be run at an expense
of scarcely more than a cent a mile and
that the price of it is low enough to place
it within the reach of persons of moderate
means. â La Nature.

pat University, Russia, disappeared from
his home last month, leaving a note to the
effect that he was about to drown himself.
For a scholar of European reputation, he
was brought to tbe point of suicide by a
remarkable train of events.
Mendelssohn was a student of the dead
languages. He had published works on
old Roman historians and on Cicero's let
ters. He had prepared a book on "Sibyl
line Utterances" and was almost ready to
send to press a critical volume regarding
New Testament Greek. Then came the
Government's inauguration of an anti-
German policy in all Russian educational
institutions. The number of German
instructors at Dorpat fell to eleven. Men
delssohn foresaw that he would be dis
missed eventually. Like most German
professors of high reputation, he had deep
learnine but little money. To assure hiss
family's future ha began speculating in
stocks. He undertook bis speculations
according to what he called a scientific
plan. Before he began them be had
studied tbe theories of chances and
methods and markets so thoroughly that
he felt competent to write an essay on tbe
subject. He wrote the essay and pub
lished it. Then he speculated.
At first, as curious as it may seem, this
pure theorist, this absolutely inexperi
enced man of letters, followed his system
with great success. His lew thousand
rubles multiplied rapidly until he had
30,000, then 70,000, and finally 125,000
rubles. He apparently regarded his sys

great wealth, for he not only commended
it repeatedly to his friends, but followed it
himself without deviation or pause. The
result was the one familiar to the historian
of systems and applied theories of chance.
Mendelssohn lost not only all his win

stood stripped of everything except bis
salary, which, he thought, might be taken
from him any day. These were his cir

Tr^e Scientific View
of a Great Building
\ â
Illusions /\nent the Universal Omnipresent
baW of Molecular Force
Just now there is being erected in this
City one of the finest buildings west of
Chicago. The new Call building wwiltl t
when completed, be the very best..struc
ture that modern science is able to devise
and construct. Equipped with every con
venience known to the age, elaborate in
detail, elegant in style, luxurious in ap
pointments, it is, moreover, solid as the
bedrock and, framed throughout of tem
pered steel, it will be able to withstand the
most violent temblor Hkely to visit this
part of the world. It will be able to bend
and sway under the rocking influence of
an earthquake without Oangerto its ten
antry. 1 have given some little attention
to the construction plans of this building,
and I feel confident that it will be a last
ing monument in every sense.
In the contemplation of a building like
this the ohief idea oncgets is that of so
lidity. Yet, as a matter of tact, there is
no greater illusion than this. There is no
such thing as solidity. The massive steel
and iron beams and girders entering into
the construction of the buildings that we
call "solid structures" are composed of
molecules that do not touch, and these
molecules are in tarn composed of atoms
also widely separated from one another.
They are in perpetual vibration, flying
apart from each other under the influence
of heat and crowding together in the
presence of cold. Could our vision be
rendered so acute as to allow of us seeing
these atoms and molecules . they would
appear very much like a swarm of gnats
which are sometimes noticeable in the
evening of a warm summer day.- So when
we speak of tbe solidity of a thing we are
using a term that does not mean what we
intend to convey. In what, then, con
sists the so-called solidity of the steel
beams? Not in tbe material atoms of its
mas?, for they are each and all apart and
in motion.
Not only does the fact apply to the steel
beam, it likewise applies to everything
cognizant to our material senses. Every
mass of matter in the world is composed
of atoms widely separated. All of the
contents of our houses, our furniture, our
adornments, our foods and our beverages
are of the same nature of structure. Even
our bodies are formed by a perpetual cir
culation of molecules. Like the circula
tion of the water which is drunk up from
the ocean by the warm sky, there to be
condensed into clouds which drift away,
are further condensed and fall as rain
upon some distant portion of the globe,
where, forming rivulets that converge into
rivers, they flow backward to the ocean to
again and again renew tbe cycle that
knows no end, so in our veins and arteries,
in our flesh and brains, everything is cir
culating ceaselessly In a rapid whirl.
What holds together the mass of matter
that we call our body?
In the nltt-a-terrestrial regions the same
law "holds. Throughout the whole uni
verse every mass of matter is but an aggre
gation of molecules. Researches in tbe
domain of physics establish the fact that
I one great law rules. Its potency is mani
fest alike in the drop of water as in the
magnificent star. It is an immaterial
force called molecular attraction. Dis
tance â space â is as nothing to its opera
tion, and the power exercised by the
smallest atom compared to thnt exercised
by the greatest mass in the universe
differs only in degree.
The reeling of a drunken man upon the
street has its dynamic influence upon the
rotation of the earth. Infinitesimally
small, but nevertheless an actual in
fluence. Everything in life â and by life I
mean the known universe â is dominated
by the omnipresent force. Every mole
cule is acted upon by every other mole
cule, whether it be in its closest approx
imity, as in the steel beam, or separated
by billion jof millions of miles, as are the
stars.
Our earth is regarded as a very reliable
and sober body, pursuing her way from

, lluence upon the earth is very much in
evidence. The eartn does not pursue au
j undeviating course, and the reason of her
j wanderings from side to side is the attrac
j tion of the moon. The common center of
â  gravity of the earth and moon is situated
1055 miles above the surface of the earth,
and around this common center the earth
makes a revolution every month. Of
course it may be humiliating for the proud
earth-dwellers to learn that the insignifi
'â  cant moon has a "pull" on their dignified
I globe; but then we may console oursalves
i with the fact ihat we, too, have a similar
; ''pull" on the sun, which revolves around
; the common center of gravity between it
:uid the- earth. What is true of the moon
j and earth and of the earth and son applies
j equally so to every globe in the heavens.
Each sways the other.
Here we have the dec!aration of science
that solidity and separation are illusions
pure and simple.
What this so-called molecular force is
we know not. We only know of its effects.
We as yet know very little of its modes of
I operation. It is a growing belief that its
! most prominent form is called electrical
j energy. But such is only con jecture. The
| material acted upon has an immense in
; fluence in determining the materialization
of the molecular force. With one form ot
matter it is light; with another form of
matter it 18 sound; with another it is
thought. It may materialize as emotion;
in fact, in each and all of the countless
manifestations of cognizant life.
Equally aa do the spheres exert their
j molecular attraction upon one another do
the individuals of our race. Every man,
I woman and child exercises his and her
share of molecular force. And inasmuch
as this force is not confined to what we
term "matter," which by the way is the
greatest illusion of all, but extends to what
we term "spirit," it follows that upon each
of us there rests some little responsibility
for the actions of our fellows. The pro
foundest knowledge of this great universal
| omnipresent law of molecular force was

THE STAGE
Life is not all cakes and ale with actors
and managers on the eve of a Presidential
election. A manager took n.e into his
confidence the other day and confessed
the fact. He said he had frequently turned
hundreds empty away from the doors of
bis theater when the ship of state was not
heaving on the billows, "but," he added,
"I do not expect to do tbat again till the i
announcements are out of McKinley's en
gagement at the White House. He will
have a four years' prosperous run and peo
ple are thinking so much of this White
House booking that they have not time to
pay attention to theaters."
The manager does not live with soul so
dead as to say to a press representative
"business is bad," but my friend brought
his burst of confidence to a crescendo by
confessing that the election had been play
ing the aged Harry with his box-office
profits. "Oh, I don't say we are losing,"
be remarked, with a haughty air oi mana
gerial pride, "but what with political
meetings and processions, hanging of flags
and letting off firecrackers, people are not
putting enough money into the theaters
to make us do a !and-oiiire business
this week." And with a chuckle of grim
satisfaction, the manager added, "and
I'm not the only one who says so."
It is a matter for especial regret that
such pood artists as the Tabers have come
to us at election time. Many distinguished;
actors and actresses have us on the list â
the black list â but it would be a sight to
make men and angels weep if America's
youngest and most gifted tragedienne
and America's hope among actor-man
agers put a blacK cross against the name
San Francisco, and made the vow "I'll
never go there anymore." Every night
when I have seen the theater only mod
erately well filled this thought bas lain
heavy on my soul, and the other evening
I made bold to seek out Mrs. Taber and
ask her about it. With one of her sweet
smiles â and they are even more sweet at
close range â she replied, "Why, we have
found the audiences here most sympa
thetic and appreciative: they are so quick
to understand and respond." And there
was a sincerity in Mrs. Taber's voice and
face which meant it; none of the buncombe
which artists so often give critics and
public. Bless Mrs. Taber's artistic soul i
I believe she would rather play to a half
rilled house that "understood" than to an
overflowing one that was stnpid. And in
these election time-, tbe people who at
tend Shakespeare are very devotees at the
shrine of art
There was another point on which I
wanted to catechise Mrs. Taber, and that
was about her costume in "Twelfth
Night," for as you may have observed she
has inaugurated a dress reform in that
charming play. Instead of appearing in
the conventional doublet and hose she
dresses her Viola in the Greek style
affected by pirates of Byronic notoriety,
and the embroidered leggings, short
kilted sKirt and heavily brocaded jacket
of velvet and gold have the merit of pic
turesqueness and are much more modest
and natural withal than the doublet and
hose. Gloss the fact over as you will, a
woman in the Elizabethan style of page's
dress looks a woman still, and if she is
mature and matronly looking she treads
dangerously near the ridiculous in Viola's
role.
"It is difficult to knew exactly how
Shakespeare intended the part to be
dressed," said Mrs. Taber, with that
earnestness which characterizes her atti
tude toward every detail of her work.
"Viola is generally played in tbe Eliza
bethan doublet and hose, but the action
of the story upon which Shakespeare
based bis play passes in Cypress, so I
think this style of dress is just as. likely to
be historically correct as the other.' 1
Is it not remarkable, the reverence with
which Shakespearean students speak of
"historical accuracy?" Shakespeare him
self made such reckless and willful anach
ronisms, sometimes apparently for the
mere pleasure of making tnem. However,
if there is a shred of robab lity for the
Byrrnic costume we ought to hail it with
thankfulness and rec mmond it especially
to ti o^e Violas who are older and es
fair to look upon than Mrs. Taber.

of us, know Gewhiliker Hay, the broken
down old-timer, whose wife makes him
wash dishes, and who tries to atone for
his present humiliations by telling blood
curdling tales of "When I crossed the
plains in '49" â the California woods are
full of good-natured "Gewhihkers,"
though they are growing fewer by degrees, I
and will have disappeared from the earth
before the next century is old. lam very
glad that Scott Marble has captured "Ge
whiliker" before he became extinct.
The false note in "Tennessee's Pardner"
is what, the pre?s agent calls "Miss E^tha
Williams' rare dramatic strength us Net
tie Bice." Miss Williams seems to have
lavished too much of her time on the
study of elocution. It is a bad habit for I
an actress to indulge in, and if pursued
too long unfits her for anything but melo
drama. "Tennessee's Pardner" is so
touching and sincere that Nettie's melo
dramatic despair grates upon its truth to
nature. However, Nettie has plenty of
applause from up aloft in spite of her elo
cuting, and she by no means mars the
charm of a very delightful and interest
ing play.
Poor- Hans Andersen! How hath thy
name been taken in vain. Once upon a
time â Andersen's fairy stories begin in
that wayâ he wrote a tale for children
which adults read and said contained a
fine moral. The hero of tbe tale was an
uncouth duckling, so much bigger and
uglier than the rest of his fluffy brood that
the very duck who hatched him said he
was no child of hers. The poultrymaid
Kicked him, the chickens pecked him,
â¢â¢because you are so ugly," they said, and
the poor little duckling, who at heart was
craving for pity and sympathy, wandered
out into the world to see if he could not
find the love which was denied him at
home. A bard time he had of it, all be
cause of his ugliness, but one day the
transformation scene came. From a re
spectful distance tbe ugly duckling was
admiring a flock of swans arching their
proud necks and spreading their beautiful
wings in the lake. "Alas, if I could only
be like those lovely creatures," he re
flected humbly, and then he glanced into
the lake. To his stupefaction tbe image
reflected there was rro longer uncouth and
repulsive. Mirrored back was a beautiful
swan, and it did not take the ugly duck
ling long to discover that be had never
been a duckling at all. Only the stupidity
of the creatures around him had pre
vented them from seeing that he was a
cygnet, endowed with all the glorious
possibilities of swandom.
It is quite another story that Paul Pot
ter and have told in their clever
drama, The Ugly Dockiing." The one
point < similarity is that the heroine's
own mother dores not recognize the
glorious possibilities in the girl till tbe
knowledge is forced upon her. I thought
I would mention this. So much has been
said and written during the last two weeks
about "the success at the Alcazar of Paul
Potter's dramatization of Hans Ander
sen's story," tbat I wanted to contribute
my humble efforts toward preventing
Hans Andersen from performing the
acrobatic feat of turning in his rave.

If play-acting people ever figured in the
tracts where good little boys and girls get
ail tbe apples and candy, and bad little
boys and girls monopolize tbe indigestion
and whipping*, a story told the other day
in the greenroom by Miss Florence Bind
ley, the soubretie at tbe Grand, would
make a valuable contribution to theatrical
tract literature.
"My schooldays terminated in a very
THE Â«AN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1896.
peculiar way," said Miss Bindley. "I was
a little tot of 5, and had become very fond
of another little girl of my own age. One
morning, when I ran to meet her, she
drew aÂ«av and said her mamma had told
her not to talk to me ' 'cause I was a show
actor.' My heart was broken. I ran home
and cried out my sorrows in my mother's
arms, and after that did my studying at
home."
Soon after "Baby" Bindley went to
Europe, and even crowned heads bowed
before her. Queen Victoria, who in the
whole of her immaculate life has never
turned up her nose at play-acting folk,
sent for the "Baby," and after heanng her
perform gave her a valuable present.
Years passed, and it was not till last win
ter that Miss Bindley went back to her
native town of Newark. In telling the
story yesterday she said:
"Somehow the wound of my childhood's
day was still fresh. I wondered where mv
aristocratic little friend was, and even as I
thought of her 1 slopped, because there,
just on the opposite side of the street, sat
a woman strange y like my playmate's
mother. She was tending an apple-stand.
Inquiries soori decided the matter. She
was my little friend's once aristocratic
mother. My chum, now a younsr woman
o: 23, was. I learned, dying of consump
tion. When I made myself known to them
they both cried and beeged roy forgive
ness, for they, too, had remembered their
thoughtless cruelty to the little show
actress girl."
"Ana then?"
Bat the last scene of all which ends this
strange, eventful history, Miss Bindley
was loath to describe. If you have read
tracts you can imagine it. Don't forget,
though, that play-acting folk, take them
ail in all, are ev-n more generous in giv
ing away their substance than the conven
tional good little boys and girls of tract
literature.
The visit of the Czar to Paris bas caused
a terrible breach between theartistsof the
Grand Opera and those of the Coruedie
Francaise. At the gala performance of
the opera Mmes. Reichemberg, Pierson,
Dudlay and Beretta of the Comedie Fran
ca i^e bad been placed in a box and were
sharing a good deal of the audience's at
tention, when 'an elderly gentleman ar
rived and amid a scene of protestation de
manded the place, it having been "re
served" twice over. The elderly gentle
man gained and for the expelled arti^s
were found places in various parts of the
house.
At the gala performance at the Comedie
Francaise, which is said to bave been a
much more attractive show, no invita
tions were given to any member of the
opera, and the singers were so indignant at
this slight that they have been airing
their woes in the public press. On the
whole the papers seem to side with the
opera sin pers, who they say are entitled
to quite as* much consideration as the
members of the Comedie. The slight put
upon the members of the Comedie Fran
caise at the opera is not discussed. For
eign correipodÂ«nts who saw it with their
own eyeo vouci. for its truth, however.
In the intervals of rehearsing his new
play, "The Daughters of Babylon," at the
Lyric Tneater, London, Wilson Barrett
slips into bis dressing-room and puts
stray half hours of toil on "The Si^n of
the Cross," which he is writing in novel
form. As a drama it was a dismal fiasco
in America, but on the other side of tbe
water "The Sign of the Cross" has been
given tbe glad hand to such an extent that
Barrett has let himself be persuaded iri'o
writing it as a novel. In addition to mak
ing a book out of his play the actor-man
ager is also making a fortune out of it
Beerbohm Tree has been expressing
himself on the subject of the decline of
the drama, which he says is due to "the
epidemic of late dininjr." Is it possible
that Mr. Tree thinks audiences must be
starved into appreciating the "legitimate"
or that his H.imlet is likely to be enjoyed
by the hungry tbeatsr-goer?
BaldWirx Jheater.
To-morrow evening Julia Marlowe Taber
and Robert Taber will begin the third and
concluding week of their engagement at
the Baldwin Theater, presenting the
double bill, "Chatterton," a one-act drama
written by Ernest Lacy of Philadelphia
for Mrs. Taber three years ago, and
Sheridan Knowies' famous old comedy,
"The Love Chase." Lacy's play deals
with the last hours in tbe fitful
life of the unfortunate boy poet. Julia
Marlowe Taber's portrayal of Chatterton
is said to be marked by great strength as
well as exquisite delicacy. "Chatterton"
and "The Love Chase" will be given on
Monday and Thursday nights.
Delia Fox and her comic opera organiza
tion-come to the Baldwin Theater for a two
weeks' engagement, commencing Mon
day, November 9. The company will be
seen in "The Little Trooper" and "Fleur
de Lis." The opening opera is to be "The
Little Trooper," the story of which is de
rived from a French original.
Qrand Opera-Jlouse.
Victory Bateman returns to tbe Grand
to-morrow evening as Mary Miller in
"Drifting Apart," a domestic drama, by
Captain James A. Herne. This will be
the first of a series of similar productions.
"Drifting Apart" is unique among sen
sational dramas, in that it has no villain.
It is said to be a picture of real life, but
how blissful wcuid real life be if it were
bereft o villains!
Tbe simple characters of a Massachu
setts fisher village form the subjects. There
are to be many striking scenic and me
chanical effects. In the first act a vessel
comes into Gloucester harbor and drops
anchor. A storm rises and a bolt of light
ning strikes the ship and sets her afire.
The cast of "Drifting Apart" will be Vic
tory Bat-man, Howard Kyle, Wilter
Feisler, Lottie Williams, Edward Heron,
Julia Bane, Frank Hatch, Mortimer
Snow, George Nichols.
Golumbia Theater.
The second and final week of the en
gagejaent of the sparkling comedy-drama
"Tennessee's Pardner," begins Monday
night at the Columbia. The play deals
with the exciting events of the early days
of the gold excitement in Nevada. The
story is probable and decidedly original.
The Connne Extravaganza Company,
numbering sixty people, headed by the
"Peerless" Corinne. will present the up
to-date and second edition of Frazier &
Gill's operatic extravagauza, "Henarick
Hudson Jr.," at the Columbia Theater
after -'Tennessee's Pardner." The scenery
is rendered striking by a series of ingeni
ous transformations.
At the TiVoli.
This week will see the last nights of
Ferris Hartman's musical extravaganza
with its wealth of songs, dances and merry
fun at the Tivoli Opera-house. In the
second edition many new features are in
troduced, one of which is the Grand Opera
quartet. New songs, dances and 'evolu-
i | tions in the march have also found equal
favor. Next Thursday evening a compli
i mentary testimonial will be tendered to
Mr. Hariman by nis many friends and
admirer*, when, in addition to a complete
production of "The Babes in the Wood,"
many volunteers will participate.
After the run oi "The Babes in the
Wood" Strauss' romantic comic opera,
"The Gypsy Baron," will be given.
At the Orpheum.
The star attraction of the new people at
the Orpheum for this week is likely to
be Mile. Amanda d'Ausfcralie, the Austra
â  lian pnma donna. She is a singer of
reputation in her native land, and has
been brought to San Francisco by Gustav
Walter to make her American debut If
Mile. d'Australie comes up to her reputa
tion in the Antipodes she will make some
tbwie of a sensation here. The Quaker
City Quartet are also on the new bill.
They are said to be among the very best
of American quartets. Howard and Bland
form a team with a terdency to comedy.
The three brothers Horn, assisted by
Miss Joe Reeves, remain, so do Herr Grais
and his trained baboon and donkey. Mays
and Hunter, the clever banjoists, will ap
pear in a new repertoire. Clayton, Jen
kins aril Jasper arc-on the bill and oth
ers. The full company will appear at {the
Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday mati
nees.
The Alcazar.
"Love on Crutches," Augustin Daly's
comedy success from the German, will taice
I the place of "The Ugiy Duckline" at the
Alcazar to-morrow evening. The situa
tons are amusing and the piece bas a
snap and dash about it that will put the
Alcazar company on its mettle.
Beatrice Lieb will make her reappear
ance as Annis Austin, Ada Rehan'- crea
tion, John T. Sullivan will be Sidney
Austin, and the rest of the cast will in
clude J. B. Polk, Gordon Foster, Frank
Doane. Char.es Bryant. Mrs. F. M. Bates.
May Buckley and Hattie Foley. Two new
scenes have been painted for the produc
tion and every attention possible will be
paid to the staging.
Jhe Ghutes.
"Arion" has been amazing thousands
during the pleasant evenings by his dar
ing and spectacular rides on a bicycle over
a live trolley wire at the Chutes. He will
give a special exhibition on the high wire
this afternoon.
A roller skating rink is the latest at
traction that the Chute management has
to offer and it will open to-day. The floor
is of Michigan maple and the skates
are Ray m on ball-bearings. The appoint
ments are perfect and everything possible
tor the convenience of the accomplished
tkater has been provided.

It Defies QravMatiorv.
The flying ballet, which has aroused so
much interest in Paris and London, as well
as at Hammerstein's Oiympia, will be
introduced to San Francisco theater-goers
by "The Brownies."
It is introduced in the third act of the
extravaganza, just before the transforma
tion scene. The stage is suddenly dark
ened, and immediately after, to the com
plete astonishment of the spectators,
fairies are discovered flying about through
the air in all directions, without visible
means of support The most wohcierfu!
part of it is that while performing their
flights to and fro they are transform* d into
birds, beetles and butterflies of tbe most
gorgeous bites, which, appear to defy all
laws of gravitation. As in the serpentine
dance, bewildering colors are thrown upon
these young women, and wben the stars
and stripes are reflected upon the aerial
dancers as a finale tbe enthusiasm of the
audience always breaks forth.
Miss yaW Gorr\ir\g.
W. B. Edminster, who a few months
ago married the blind contralto. Miss
Estrelia Belinfante, in this City, writes to
say that he is bringing Mis-* Ellen Beach
Yaw, the Los Angeles singer, to tbe coast,
under the auspices of Major James B.
Pond. It is expected that the first concert
here will be given about November 28.
This is the third time that Miss Yaw has
been announced, and lovers of high notes,
who are curious to hear ht>r, can derive
comfort from the fact that the third time
ia generally the lucky one.
J4ir\a La Blonde.
A startling play by Alexandra Fontanes,
based on student life in the Latin Quarter,
is arousing great interest in Paris just
now. '-Nina la Blonde" gives a very dif
ferent picture of the Quarter from that
contained in "Trilby," however. Tbe cen
tral characters keep moderately sober, but
all round them people shout and brawl
and get intoxicated. There are tableaux
of student life full of breezy movement,
but the students drink bocks of beer and
beat them on tbe tables for more; they
sing diabolic refrains and organize reck
less improvised dances, and everything is
very much alive and animated, though a
trine coarse. It is the sort of life one sees
at tbe Chateau d'Eau.
The blonde-haired Nina, the heroine of
Alexandre Fontanes' piay, ia a sort of
Latin quarter Dame aux Gametias. Alex
anare Dumas' heroine became a little gri
sette. Under the influence of her love tor
Georges, one of the beer-drinking stu*
dents. Nina becomes a model of all the
virtues. But Henri, another- student, is
also fascinated with Nina. One day he
calls upon her and tries to obtain by force
the kiss that she refuses him, he flings his
arm round her neck, with an embrace sp
violent that he breaks it, and Nina falls
back, motionless, dead.
Henri is seized with terror. No one has
seen him enter â he escapes without be
ing seen. A few minutes later Georges
comes. He has drunk a good deal at the
brasserie, in fact he is a little intoxicated.
Outside in the street, he has encountered
two footpads, who tried to hold him up,
and his face is bruhed and his hands
are scratched.
You can guess what happens. Georges
is mistaken for the assassin. Everything
accuses him, and when the trial comes on
he seems sure of going to the guillotine.
The Public Prosecutor is Henri's father.
One day his son appears before him, hag
gard and disheveled. "Georges is inno
cent: I know it," be exclaims. "How do
you know?" asks his father, sternly.
There is a terrible pause, and Henri flings
himself weeping at his father's feet. The
Prosecuting Attorney divines the truth,
and with Brutus-like fortitude he says:
"In that case the best thin.' you can do
is to give yourself up to justice."
To say the least of it, "Nina la Blonde"
is a startling play, and no doubt will be
done into English before long. A revised
and expunged edition will have to be
issuer before it meets the taste of the
American public, however.
Dramatic Brevities.
Mme. Elenora Duse is to spend at least part

Miss Beabrooke is'already practicing bareback
riding for her entrance in the last act.

has writieu, and the Paris Odeon has accep'ed.
Wilton Lackaye'B tour .will commence on

November 9, revolves around the political
system of Russia, ami shows the peculiar laws

While Mr. de Kovu . has not reached in
"The Mandarin" the qualities attained in
"Robin Hood," he has succeeded in accom
plishing just what he started out to do-write
an opera for the ears of the masses.
"My Friend From India," one of *,he most
successful of the new plays produced in New
York this fall, was written by a man who for
thirty-one years has been licking out tele
graph messages. His uame is Dv Sucnet and
he is 54 years of age.
Boston Is moving in the abolition of obstruc
tive hats in theaters. One manager sends an
usher to every offending woman just before

nuisance, and in nearly every case she com
plies without much ado.

for the students, will be giveÂ» their initial
production. Much interest is being mani
tested by the friends of George S. Whetty, who
plays "A Knight of the Lost Cause," which

Mapleson states thai Mme. Darclee, who
made her appearance on Wednesday at the
Academy of MuslÂ« in "Traviuta," is a member
of a family prominent at the Imperial Court
at St. Petersburg and that she adopted the
stage after her family had met with a reverse
of fortune.
It now appears, from u<e press agent's state
ment, that Archibald Clavering Gunter was
prepared for the failure of "A Florida En
chantment" at Hoyt's Thea er. He had a
dramatization of his latest novel, "Her
Senator," up his sleeve, sll ready to spring on

to-day displayed far more activity than had been
expected. The brokers were busy making their
! arrangements lor the parade, but stilt they found
. time lo'execute the orders that drifted In as a re
sult of the decisive action taken by the bankers
yesterday to relieve the stringency in money. The
difficulty experienced in obtaining funds was a
drawback to the market from the opening of tbe
week until yesterday. Saturday is a.ways an off
''day in the money market, so that nothing of an
important character was looked for this morning
in the matter of call loans.

BRYANISTIC MEN
TO DIVIDE THE PIE
California Democrats Want
to Shut Out Their
Allies.
Big Offices Are Demanded for
Figuring Out a Paper
Majority.
HOW A RUMPUS WAS AVERTED.
Gavin McNab's "High Water Panls"
Win Him the Portfolio of Agri
culture Against R. P. Troy.
There is danger of a mutiny in the
Democratic ranks of California. This was
caused by th- publication of a telegram
from Chicago on the day that Mr. Bryan
visited that city, pretending to present
the formation of Bryan's Cabinet in the
event of his election.
The greatest consternation was caused
by the announcements made in that dis
patch, for it was there stated that Gov
ernor Altgeld of Illinois had been decided
on for Attorney-General, and that other
places had been parceled out to some of
"those Eastern fellows," like Benjamin
R. Tillman, Eugene V. Debs, J. S. Coxey
and David Bennett Hill, the only repre
sentatives of the wide and woolly West
being Henry M. Teller, ex-Governor
Waite of Colorado and Senator Stewart of
Nevada.
Now the leading Bryanistic Democrats
of California have been doing a great deal
of figuring, and by their own fictitious
statistics have convinced themselves that
they have a chance to carry California for
their favorite candidate. Having per
formed this herculean mathematical op*
eration, they have taken great credit to
themselves, for they argue that if Cali
fornia goes for Bryan and Bryan should
by chance win, they will be entitled to all
the credit and all the offices, especially all
the Cabinet offices.
Why not? Do they not belong to the
party that preaches the doctrine that to
the victors bclont; the spoil??
Have they not won California (on paper)
for Bryan? '
Certainly.
Then forward the Bread and Butter Bri
gade! On to the Pie Counter!
Snch was the decision that was reached
at an executive session of the Democratic
nabobs (hat is reperted to have been held
at the California Hotel. Rumor has it
that George \V. Baker of the Bimetallic
League, W. P. Lawlor of the Silver Cam
paign Committee, E. M. Wardall of the
Populist party and Charles D. Lane, the
"angel" of all the Bryan forces, attempted
to break into the meeting, hoping to ob
tain "recognition" for a small piece of pie,
but they were curtly dismissed, so it is
said, with the intimation that they were
welcome as allies, but were not expected
to share in the fruits of victory â not even
in a victory that exists only on" paper.
Then the solemn conclave began its
ponderous deliberations.
It was primarily decided that if Mr.
Bryan should not at once signify his ac
ceptance of this programme he might
know what to expect when the votes of
California are counted after next Tuesday.
W. H. Alford, the boy manager of the
boy orator's campaign in California, was
the first to speak. He said that modesty
would prevent him from naming the posi
tion to which he thought he was entitled.
He supposed they would remember the
fact that he is chairman of the Democratic
Campaign Committee and he would leave
it lor some kind friend to suggest what
ought to be hib reward for figuring out a
Bryan majority in California.
By unanimous vote it was decided that
Mr. Alford ought to be Secretary of State,
it being conceded that a boy orator should
have a boy "premier," a "title which will
be adopted under the rule of Altgeldisrn.
After that a sauabble ensued between
Gavin Mcv Nab and" R. P. Troy, the efficient
secretary of the campaign committee, as
to which should be the Secretary of Agri
culture. The friends of Mr. McNab in-
Bisted that he looked like a Populist farm
er, and asked him to stand up and let the
committee get a good view of his "uigh
water pants." This argument was a
clincher and Mr. McNab was given the
place.
Frank Gould came all the way from
Stockton to demand his share, and with
his usual lucic he walked off with the
naval portfolio, urging as a reason that he
had served an apprenticeship to an able
seaman on the raging billows of Mormon
Channel.
J. J. Dwyer was given the Attorney-
Generalship becausein a recent hÂ»
let it be known that he "would be able to
tell the difference between a Pullman car
and a mail coach."
Max Popper was granted permission to
accept the position of Secretary of the
Treasury, and S..m Braunhart is booked
to be Secretary of War.
Reel B. Terry said he would "kick" if
they slated him for nothing better than |
Postmaster-General, but he was finally
pacified by the assurance that his posi
uon as boss of the letter-carriers wouid
not interfere with his law practice.
M. F. Tarpey had parceled out to him
the Secretaryship of the Interior, aqd the
meeting adjourned after sending word to
John P. Irish, John Daggett and other
Cleveland Democrats that they must pre
pare to make room for pro-silver Demo
crats after the 4th of next March, or as
soon thereafter as the civil service law can
be repealed.
A congratulatory teiegram was ordered
forwarded to Mr. Bryan, telling him that
they hoped ha would justify what ihey
had said about him being a Washington
and Lincoln combined, and ttie greatest
man who had ever occupied the Presiden
tial chair.
ALL SOULS' DAY.
CalTarlan Society Commemoration to
Be Held at the Cathedral.
This afternoon at 3 o'c'ock serv
ices commemorating All Souls' day will
be held at St. Mary's Cathedral. The
feast of all souls is an old one in the
Catholic church. It was first observed
about tne year 1048 in France by the Ab
bot Odilon, who ordered that in all his
monasteries prayers should be recited
every year on November 2 for the relief of
the souls in pureatory. About the same
time Pope John XVI ordained that the
day should be observed throughout the
whole church.
In some countries more than in others
the practive of offering prayer for the
dead during the entire month of Novem
ber prevails, November being called the
month of the dead. Tne origin of the
month of the dead may be traced back to
a very ancient Deriod, long before the
Christian era. Under a different form it
constituted one of the most general and
usual forms of prayer for the deceased
among the Jewish people. Indeed devo
tion toward the dead appears to be one of
their most remarkable rites.
In Scriptural teaching the church finds
exhortation "t pray ior the dead that
tney may be loosed from sins." In ac
cordance then wnh its mission upon earth
of helping mankind, the church extends
its charity even oeyond this hie and prays
for the departed, for all souis.
This annual meeting at the cathedral is
attended not only by members of the
Calvarian Society, but by Catholic people
generally. The Very Reverend J. J. Pren
dergast will deliver a sermon. An excep
tional choir, under the leadership of Pro
fessor Harrison, will render music proper
to the solemn occasion.
OBJECTS OF CHARITY.
Contributions Can Be Left With the F.x
presgnian a. Clay and Montgomery.
The sad and sudden death of William
Kennedy, who lost his life by a crowbar
which fell and struck him on the head
while digging a well in the Mission a few
days ago, has left his widow and three
children destitute.
In their mis ortune the desolate family
has taken temporary quarters with Mrs.
Kennedy's uroiher at 310 Bemis street
This brother is old, sickly and poor,
having a lamily of seven children and a
wife to support. Consequently he cannot
afford the widow and orphans a home.
The three little eirls of the deceased,
Mary, Cecelia and Lizzie, aged 11. 8 and 4
years respectively, have been attendine
fci. Anthony's School, but were necessarily
withdrawn for the present. The two fami
lies are living together in a little house
perched away upon ihe hillside, with very
little in the wardrobes and very little on
the pantry shelves. Twelve persons to be
fed and clothed, all dependent upon the
exertions of one sick man. If any chari
tably inclined persons in this City wish
to send money* food or clothing to the
hungry little ones they can do so by leav
ing the same with J. W. Sullivan, an ei
presaman who has a stand at the south
west corner ot Clay and Montgomery
streets, who will convey the same to the
family.
This is a case of actual want, and those
who may wish to aid a worthy widow and
her three little girl orphans can now do so.
SOME FOOTBALL DON`TS
Walter Camp Defines a Great
Player and What He
Should Not Do.
An Instructive List of Hints for
Use on the Grid
iron.
Walter Camp of Yale, "the father of
football," and L. F. Delard, the great Har
vard footoail strategist, have published
a list of some of the most important foot
ball "don'ts." The list is instructive in
outlining what constitutes a really great
player, while at the same time it estab
lishes a standard by which men in a con
test may be measured irrespective of their
occasional star performances. The list
follows :
Dop.'t fail to play a fast game. Line up In
stantly after each down. \our game is twice
as effective if there are no delays.
Don't slug. Scrapping is not footbali. More
than this, it prevents good playing.
Don't wait for the opposing* runner in the
line. Break through and stop him before he
reaches the line.
Don't tackle above the waist or below the
knees, but always at the hips. When about to
tackle keep your eyes on the runner's hips and
he cannot so readily deceive you in his move
men w.
Don't let any player whom you tackle gain
an inch afterward. Never let him gain nis
length by falling forward. Lift him off his
feet and throw him back toward his goal.
Don't fail to try to take the ball away from
an opponent when he is tackled. Make a fea
ture of this ana you will succeed oftener than
you anticipate.
Don't let any thought take precedence of
the ball itself. Keep your mind on the ball.
Follow its every motion to drop on it after any
fumble or misplay.
Don't be satisfied with a superficial knowl
edge of the rules. Master every detail.
Don't let your opponent know when or
where you are hurt.
Don't make excuses, however good they may
be. There is no room in football for excuses.
Don't answer back to a coach upon the field,
even If you know him to be wrong. Do ex
actly what he tells you to do, so far as you are
able, and remember that strict obedience is
the first requirement of a player.
Don't lose your temper. The man who can
not control his temper has no business on the
football field.
Don't be one minute late to practice. The
hour named is the hour for you to be on hand.
If you have not Interest enough to be prompt,
resign from the game at once, for you have
not the proper spirit ior victory.
Don't let half the players of your team be in
their positions on any lineup before you have
taken yours.
Don't forget the vital principle ol team play,
which cannot be too often impressed upon the
mind. It is this: Team play begins the in
stant the center receives the ball from the
hands of the runner. In other words, it is a
part of team play, and the most important
part, to line up more quickly than your oppo
nents. This is the very truest sort of team
play, yet the delay of one single man in tak
ing his place will ruin it completely.
Don't be an automaton. Thoroughly master
each principle and then vary your play as
emergencies arise.
Don't let any man be ahead of you in drop
ping on the ball when it is fumbled.
Don't fail to try to be in every interference
before it is finally stopj cd. Follow each run
ner, and watch for a chance to push him or
receive the ball from him when he is tackled.
Don't play high if you are checking an inter
ference or running as a part of the interfer
ference. When you drop out of an interfer
ence meet your opponent as low as possiDle.
Don't fail to go down the field under every
kick.
Don't forget the rule that your own runner
must never be alone when he is tackled.
Don't shirk any required study or work for
football. Earn the right to play football or
don't attempt it.
Don't be discouraged with your abilities or
prowess. The risht spirit in footb&ll is worth
more tban anything. Be sure you have that
and your chances of success arc good.
Don't whine about decisions which seem un
fair. Accept only honest, fearless officials,
and then leave the game in their hands.
Don't do anything to undermine discipline,
or you are putting the ax at the very root of
the tree.
Don't be careless about guards, protectors,
or padding over any weak, injured or exposed
part o/ the body. One negligence may cost
you the season's playing.

THE NEST OF AN
INFANT INDUSTRY
A High Caste Brahma
Mother Hen and Her
Philosophy.
She Houses Her Chicks in an
Old Republican Campaign
Banner.
PROTECTION IN THE FABRIC.
It Is a Remarkably Living Picture, a
Parable, an Allegory of
.Truth.
Out near Harbor View abides an old
hen named Mary. It has been years since
Mary was a large white ez â¢ nestling with
a number of her spheroidal brothers and
sisters in a soapbox at Petaluma. No in
cubator other than Mary's natural an
cestress warmed her into feathers. No
smoky coal-oil lamp was Mary's foster
mother.
She is of the Brahma breed, with a high
caste crest, with feathers on her heels like
a Mercury, and her line can be traced
back through the poultry generations to
the morning when the first of her race
flew cackling out of the ark. Mary grew
rapidly from downy chickhood to the
"sprine" market age, and only escaped
becoming a taniale t)y reason of fine ap
pearance, consequently she was saved to
scratch and cluck through successive pe
riods of maternity.
(lifted with rare intellect as well as do
mestic industry, she wasted no batching
season in a vain attempt to achieve poster
ity from a white doorknob or a porcelain
egg. She knew her lay, aad every cheeper
she led out to bugs and worms was of her
very own to the ultimate feather.
But it was reserved for the piping time
of politics for Mary to thrust herself
into prominence. The opportunity hap
pened along her way and she arose to it â
literally flew up to meet it. Last Mon
day the rain caught her out with her
brood in a large vacant lot chasing the
nimble but edible grasshopper tor the
family dinner. She hurried the chicles in
out ot the wet and found a dry refuge in
an old barn.
In one corner of the building among the
rubbish of ages was the remnants of a
campaign banner which had been worn
by wind and weather and had been laid
away, its work well done.
Whether she saw among the soft folds
of the dusty and dry fabric a place for a
warm nest, or, from the appearance of the
magic word, "protection," she concluded
that the location was a safe home for an
infant industry, no man may say. Possi
bly the latter idea moved her to settle
down there, and there may be more in
a hen's philosophy than she is given credit
for.
Albeit Mary has taken up her abode
there and when the day goes out throueh
the Golden Gate and the Presidio Heights
heave their shadows far eastward the
mother hen and her brood sleep in the
mottoed nest. It is a living picture, a
parable, an allegory.
GERMAN BENEVOLENCE.
Quarterly. Meeting of the > Society liast
Evening;.
The German General Benevolent Society
held its quarterly meeting Thursday even
ing at Druids' Hall. Toe committee reports
were , not read, having previously . been
published. s i*' ir?'
. President 8. Broemmel read his report,
making an excellent showing in every
respect, as may be seen from the following
facts and figures: Financial improvement
since June 30, $4781 66. notwithstanding
the heavy payments for . street assess
ments, exceeding $3000. The causes of
such ' hiphly satisfactory results are good
management, and above all a very
liberal patronage of our hospital by the
general public. : >;
The relief committee was able to ex
tend assistance to 255 men, 128 women and
165 families,, aggregating $1042 30. The
number of members and subscribers on

LORIN`S NEW MISSION.
The Opening Services in S f .
Matthew's Episcopal
Edifice.
A Number of Ministers From This
City and O.k and Wi 1 Be
in Attendance.
St. Matthew's Episcopal Mission of
Lorin, upon which ths carpenters and
painter; were putting the finishing
touches as late as sundown last evening,
will see the opening services within its
walls this afternoon.
It is a pretty little chapel at the corner
of Calais street and Alcatraz avenue. The
edifice will not be consecrated for the
reason that it is not fully paid for, but the
consecration services, marking the liqui
dation of the debt, will not, it is thought,
be long postponed.
The little congregation has been holding
ts services in a hall at the corner of Her
mann and Calais streets for several years,
working steadily, however, and looking
forward to the time when it would have
its own church. The lot was purchased
and now the building is completed and
the congregation has held its last service
in the old hall.
This morning holy communion services
will be conducted by the missionary, Rev.
T. L. Randolph, assisted by the lay reader,
R. H. Bpencer. The opening services
will consist of the evening prayer and ser
mon, the latter by Rev. Dr. McClure. The
chnrcn is beautifully decorated with
flowers for the occasion.
T c Bishop will not be present, his en

Lives After Taking Strychnine.
John lianob, 74 years of age, living at 9
Shotwell street, took a dose of strychnine on
Friday during a fit of despondency. As soon as
his condition was discovered he was removed
to the City and County Hospital, where the
physicians went to work with a will, it is
very rarely that a person recovers from
strychnine-poisoninn, but last evening the
doctors expressed the belief that the man's
life had been saved. Hanob is a widower and
a native of England.
