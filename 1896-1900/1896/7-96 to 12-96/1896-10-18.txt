VOTERS' ARMIES
INVADE CANTON
Great Day of the Campaign
at the Home of Major
McKinley.
Fifty Special Trains Required to
Carry Pilgrims to the Shrine
of Republicanism.
CLIMAX OF WILD ENTHUSIASM
All Classes Testify Their Loyalty to
the Cause of Proection and
National Honor.
CANTON. Ohio, Oct. 17.â Major McKin
ley closed the week with another day of
remarkable campaigning in his own home.
Twenty-four thousand viators came to see
and hear him. There were more large
delegations than had ever been seen here
in a single day. The voters came in '
brigades and in army corps.
It took more than fif iv special trains to
transport them and seventy-one bands to
furnish marching music. The cominsr of
delegations to Canton doubtless reached
its climax. Greater numbers and more
inspiring enthusiasm cannot be expected.
For ten hours a swaying and undiminish
ing crowd of people surged about Major
McKinley's house. Delegations stood in
line for a distance of a mile, and it took
some of them three and a half hours to
reach the stand from which Major McKin
ley spoke.
Opposite the McKinley residence on
each street the terraces were banked with
tiers of people and there hundreds of
women stood for hours waving their hand
kerchiefs and clapping the' hands as the
delegations came marching ap, and Mc-
Kinley, with his rinsing voice and earnest
air, addressed them. At no time during
the campaign has Major McKinley spoken
with more vigor and more spirit than to
day, and at no time has he seemed
stronger and better equal to the task of
greeting multitudes. He made twenty
speeches in all during the day.
delegation b began to arrive at 5:30 this
morning, the first-comers being from
Pennsylvania and Michigan. At 8 o'clock
300 voters from Monroe County, Michigan,
marched op Market street to Major Me- i
Kinley's house and caused him to dis- j
patch his breakfast with naste. They
were not kept waiting more than ten min
utes. Their spokesman, D. A. Curtis of
Monroe, Mich., made a lively address to
Major McKinley and assuredhim that his
plurality in Michigan would exceed 20,000.

visitors for their call and urged them to
stand firmly for the party of protection
and sound nion a y.
Major McKinley's next callers came with
drums beating and flags flying at 9
o'ciock. There were three delegations in
the assemblage that filled the McKinley
yard. One was from Altoona, Blair County,
Pa., numbering 1400 men; a delegation of
150 miners from South Fork, and another
of 150 miners ffom Portage, Cambria
County, Pa. W. H. Schwarts of Altoona
introduced the Blair County delegation,
J. H. Dietrick spoke for the South Fork
visitors, and E. P. Hughes, himselt a
miner, was spokesman for his fellow
workers from Portage. Major McKinley
has seldom faced a more enthusiastic aud
ience than this one. >
The fourth speech was made at 10:30 to
a fine delegation from Grand Rapids and
Western Michigan. It was largely com
posed of railway men and men en
gaged in the manufacture of fur
niture. The spokesman, Willis B.
Perkins, told how disastrous to Michi
gan and her industries the partial free
trade had been. Major McKinley, after a
few remarks suggested by the address of
the spokesman, read a short speech from
manuscript.
The first great delegation of the day
came from Ashtabula County, Ohio. It
was a small army, numbering 2500 men.
There were farmers, mechanics, railroad
men and dockmen in the crowd. The
dockmen wore their bine working jackets
and overalls. More than fifty banners
with appropriate political inscriptions
were borne in the Ashtabula County dele
gation. They greeted Mr. McKinley with
mighty cheers. Congressman F. A.
I Northway was the spokesman. A large
delegation of miners and farmers from
Ferry County, Ohio, came within bearing
distance just behind the Ashtabula
people. 8. W. Pascoe presented them to
Major Mi Kinley, who addressed the two
delegations.
Three thousand stalwart workingmen
from the shops, mills and mines of Oliver
Bros, in Pittsburg and Uniontown, Pa.,
were tbe next callers. Georee T. Oliver
introduced them to Major McKinley.
Three hundred and fifty employes of the
Adams-Bacnal Electric Light Company
of Cleveland, who had been patiently
waiting behind the stand, were introduced
by L. R. Offers. One of the banners borne
in this delegation said, "McKinley may
look like Napoleon, but Bryan does not
look like Wellington." Major McKinley
addressed the delegation briefly.
Short speeches became necessary at this
point when delegation after delegation
was pressing for attention. The Republi
can Club of Hobart, Ind., was brought to
Major McKinley by its spokesman, J. 8.
Swanson, and tbe candidate thanked its
members for their call.
The ninth speech was made to one of
tbe largest delegations of the day. It was
composed of traveling men from Toledo
and Columbus, Ohio. Several fine bands
and the Columbus Glee Club were with it
I J. Fenemore spoice in behalf of the Colum
bus arrivals and E. E. Dow for the Toledo
men. Major McKinley made a ringing
response.
College yells from 500 students rent the
air as the boys from the Onio State Uni
versity and the Ohio Wesleyan University
at Delaware marched joyously from the
station. Following them was a body of i
elderly people from Westerville, Ohio,
each one more than 50 years of age, and a
delegation of students from the Ohio Med
ical University at Columbus. Rev. D W.
Downey spoke for the "old folks," H. 8.
Culver for the Delaware students, A. L.
Cope for those from the State University,
C. M. Taylor for the medical students and
W. C. Rogers for a very considerable num
ber of voters from Becksville. Ohio, who
were included in the assemblage.
Major McKinley did not have time to
make a long speech to this great con
solidated delegation, but his remarks
were received with great enthusiasm.
The scene about Major McKiniey's
house at 3:30 in the afternoon cannot be
adequately described. The broad street on
which the house faces was packed with
men four and often eight abreast for a dis
tance ol three-quarters of a mile and in
several side streets delegations were stand
ing waiting: their turn to be received.
The next invading army was from Ken
tucky. It was 4000 strong, and the spokes
man, Lieutenant-Governor Worthington,
told Major McKinl^y to expect a big plu
rality from his State. Major McKinley
has seldom had more enthusiastic vis
itors. With the Kentucky delegation
were 2000 employes of the Louisville and
Nashville road. They were introduced by
F. N. Burgess and Major McKinley ad
dressed some remarks to them.
"We have 3000 voters in our delegation,"
was the proud statement made by State
Senator Stuart Reed of Clarksburg, W.Va.,
when the men from his State came swing
ing up the street. Mr. Reed made a short
address and was followed by V. T. Cramp,
who spoke eloquently on behalf of the
colored voters of West Virginia. After
waiting for five minutes for the applause
and cheering to subside, Major McKinley
responded.
The railway delegation, which came
next, was a large one. There were 4000
men in line. One thousand came from
the Lake Shore shops in Jackson, Mich.,
1000 from the carshops and yards in Cleve
land and 1000 from the Pennsylvania
shops in Columbus. The Michigan men
were introduced by Colonel J. E. Terrell,
the Erie men by Willard Kflls, the Co
lumbus men by C. C. Corner.
A ladies' club from Cuyahoga Falls and
a railway men's club from the same place
were next in line. The women were cor
dially cheered, and Major McKinley made
them a short but spirited speech. The
same speech was also addressed to the em
ployes of the Walker Manufacturing Com
pany of Cleveland.
A delegation of 3000 wage-earners ar
rived from Baltimore, Md., at 3 o'clock. It
took them just two hours and a quarter to
get near enough to Major McKinley to
bear his voice. It was an imposing dele
gation. It was 6 o'clock when Major Mc-
Kinley stood up to address his Baltimore
visitors.
Passing closely upon the heels of the
Baltimore delegation was the Twelfth
Ward Republican Club of Cleveland, 800
strong. James H. Hoyt was its spokes
man, and Major McKinley's greeting was
cordial, thdngh brief.

Destined to Meet a
Waterloo.
Spanish Soldiers Already Show

Their Tactics.
AN IXPEILED EDITOR'S VIEWS
Says the Forces of the Oppressors
Will Be Drivn From the Con
tinent of South America.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 17.-Benor
Manuel J. Moran, who was deposed by
Cuba's captain-general, Weyler, from the
editorship of La Discusion of Havana be
cause of his alleged too free treatment of
events in Cuba, arrived yesterday on the
steamer Ciudad Conda. In an interview
with a reporter of the United Associated
Presses he said: "If the plans of General
Gomez have not miscarried an advance
guard of 1500 patriots is to-day crossing
from the province of Santa Clara into the
province of Matanzas and, with the main
body, to Follow in a few days, will strike
what is expected to be the decisive blow
in the campaign.
"With Maceo In the east awaiting this
movement," said Senor Moran, "and
Gomez pressing forward, the Spanish
forces will be sandwiched. It will be the
greatest and in probability the final stroke
for freedom.
"Not until this struggle is ended," he
continued, "and the people of Cuba attain
their independence will the world know
how the truth has been systematically
suppressed. Under existing circumstances
it is impossible to send out the truth con
cerning any victory or advantage trained
by the insurgents, so strict is the censor
ship. Should the editor of a newspaper
publish any news distasteful to the cap
tain-gpneral he (the editor) is called upon
to disclose the source of bis information.
Refusal means imprisonment. Betrayal
of the author of the. information means
the death of that person.
"There are fewer executions than there
were two months ago. Within the last
three weeks Weyler was notified by f re
mier Canovas not to kill so many, as it
was attracting too much attention. What
ever executions now take place are in.
secret. The Spanish commanders under
Weyler are beginning to show the white
feather. It may seem incredible to an
American mi itary man, but I state the
simple truth wheii I say that the royal
troops in the province of Havana are
never moved in bodies of less than a
thousand. They are afraid to venture out
with a smaller number. It will be equally
surprising when I state that General Wey
ler, who professes to be as able a tactician
as he is a butcher, now proposes as his
coup de grace to surround the impregnable
heights held by Maceo and wait for the
Cuban general 10 come down.
"The patriot army is better equipped at
present than it has been at any time, all
reports to the contrary notwithstanding.
No one knows better than Weyler that
Maceo cannot be dislodged from his po
sition in Pinar del Rio. Nevertheless the
captain-general is actually in earnest in
his crazy plan to besiege him. The ad
vance guard of Gomez, I have no doubt, is
at tiiii moment in the province of Santa
Clara, or on its border, and the most im
portant engagement in the revolution
cannot be far off.
"The Spaniards must meet them, and
when they mcct â " and Moran 's dark
eyes lighted vp â "it will be the Waterloo
of the Spanish army on the continent of
South America."

ONE DOCTOR KILLS ANOTHER.
An Old Grudge Causes Alfred Holt to
Shoot P. S. Rhett, a Former
Friend.
NATCHEZ, Mibb., Oct. 17.â Dr. Alfred
Holt of Hayes, Miss., shot and instantly
killed Dr. P^ 8. Rhett of Jonesville, La., in
the rotunda of the Natchez Hotel this
morning. Holt was arrested, but subse
quently released on $10,000 bail.
Both Holt and Rhett were known
throughout the South as physicians of
great ability and each had a large prac
tice. The tragedy was the result of an old
grudge. They were formerly friends, but
disagreed over som* trifling affair, it is
said. Holt approached Rhett as he was
standing near the newscounter talking to
a friend. Drawine a revolver and taking
careful aim Holt fired, the bullet striking
his victim in the breast. Two more shots
followed rapidly and Rhett fell, receiving
a lourth bullet as he lay on th*> floor.
There was great excitement among the
guests, who ruÃhed from ihe billiard and
reading rooms. Holt made no effort to
escape, but surrendered himself to a
policeman.

PORTLAND, Ob., Oct. 17.â Frederick
yon Keiustein a man bearing his three
score and ten years as if they were but
fifty, came to Portland from the Cascade
Locks last evening, where he had been en-j
gaged at manual labor for the past six
months. He is en route to Munich,
Bavaria, to take possession of a great
estate nnd the title of Graf, or count, both
of which are his by inheritance. He de
parted to-night by tde Northern Pacific
for New York, where correspondence
awaits him at the German Consulate Gen

Mr. yon Reinstein's history is one long
romance. He belongs to a collateral
branch of the powerful Matternich fam
ily, and he claims tc be the only member
of his family ever having engaged in any
vocation outride of politics and Statecraft.
In 1843 be graduated from the university
at Heidelberg, after which he was gazetted
as a sub-lieutenant in the Bavarian army.
Soon thereafter he wedded a burgher's
daughter, whom he learned to know and
love in the University city. She had no
dot and her people were obscure, which
circumstance in a measure estranged him
from his own family. Besides that, his
fellow officers of noble birtii refused to al
low ttieir wives to recognize Reinstein's
wife on an equal social footing. This
rankled in tde young officer's breast, and
two years later he fought a duel on that
score, killing his adversary.

family in Munich, and as my so-called
mesalliance had already placed me on tne

but to quit my native land. It was a case
of life or death with me, and preferring
the former, a week later found me on an
American-bound sailing vessel, accom

standing the estrangement between my
self and my family, my father graciously

my door for some time after reaching far
off America. This my noble father did

fought a fatal duel that was forced upon
him to protect the honor of his wife."
On his arrival in this country he sought
the home of many noble German exiles
of that periodâ St. Louis, Mo. His wife,
an accomplished young woman, there
founded the first German young ladies'
seminary in the United States. But the

1855 made her one of its victims.

JUMP OF WHEAT PRICES
Great Day for the Bulls in the
Pit of the Cbicago Board
ol Trad i.
Scarcity cf the Crop Abroad ?nd In
crease! Demands Cause the
Sharp Advance.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 17.â 1t was an
other great bull day in the wheat pit of
the Chicago Board of Trade. The excite
ment was at the feverish stage ail through
tbe session. December wheat took an
other flyer in price â 4 cents over the clos
ing price yesterday â although 75% cents
was tbe official closing quota 1 ion. De
cember really brought 7*iVg cents belore
tbe scrambling left the pit. Yesterday's I
closing price was 72% cents.
Tbere was general alarm when the mar
ket opened this morning lest there would i
not be enough wheat to go around, and |
there was not a bushel to be hud for less i
than 1% cents advance on yesterday's !
closing price. In fact, very little could !
be had ander 74 cents, or 1% cÂ»nts higher i
than it closed yesterday for December de- !
livery. The reason for this sudden and ;
substantial rise was to be found by glanc- j
ing at tbe Liverpool and London cables. ,
The foreign markets led in the scramble,
just as they did the day before, and the
advance ot 3 cents in Liverpool was quickly
re-echoed here.
MiJme, Bod man & Co., New York, wired
their house here tbat all tbe wheat they
badoffered to the United Kingdom last
night at 2 cents a bushel over the market I
had been accepted, and other New
York houses reported that wheat offered
by them to tbe Continent at 3% cents over
last night's closing prices had been !
snapped up. With this starter the De
cember prices bid were from 73}<f to 74
cents. This advance was quickly followed
by further exchange dispatches, both for
eign and domestic, which started the price
to 74% cents.
News came from San Francisco that two
more steamer cargoes of wheat had been
taken for India and tbat inquiries were
being made for sailing vessels to take
more wheat to India. The whole situation
was recorded here as a consequence* of the
stolid indifference of European grain
dealers during the last year to the risks
they were running by allowing their
stocks to run down nearly to tbe bottom
in the face of bad crop reports.

An Editor Becomes the Target for the
Ntbraskan's Remarks Durirg
One Rally.
DETROIT, Mich., Oct. 17.â Mr. Bryan
ended his four days of Michigan cam
paigning with three speeches at Detroit to
night. During that time he traveled
nearly 1400 miles through the State and
made about seventy speeches- His clos
ing day was devoted to tbe eastern part of
tbe State, along Lake Huron, between St.
Johns, a town near Lansing, to this city.
He made fifteen speeches and had big
audiences everywhere. Tbe succession of
large towns along the route followed rap
idly, one alter the other. Incidents of in
terest at tbe meetings addressed were
numerous.
Mrs. Bryan was caught among a crush
of excited people at Sa^inaw and me train
started away without her, but was stopped
after having proceeded a very short dis
tance.
In tbe crowd at Owosso early in the
morning Mr. Bryan bad pointed out to
him by his request the editor of a Palmer
and Buckner local paper, who had pro
pounded some questions for the nominee
to answer, and made bis presence conspic
uous to the delight of the audience.
Mr. Bryan looked toward a wasron on
wLich tbe editor was standing and said:
"I am informed that the editor of the
Owosso Press is standing on that wagon
in the rear of the crowd and wears a blue
cap. Now, I will ask him a question.
Did you indorse the financial plank pre
sented by the minority at the Cuicuyo
convention ?" He paused a minute. "1
repeat the question. You have asked me
questions, you outfit to be willing to
answer questions. Did you indorse the
minority plank at Chicago?"
Another pause. Mr. Bryan continued:
Well, my friends, I have spent so much time
trying to find tbe editor of this paper and to
unmask a man who is seeking to elect a. Re
publican by pretending to support the Indi.m
apolls ticket that I find I have no time left to
talk to you. I a-k. you to rememb r that the
go d standard never fought an open fight.
Those who supported the minority plank at
Chicago pretended to be afraid that free coin
ago woUid prevent international bimetallism,
and when they got to Indianapolis they forgot
all about international bimetallism and de
clared for the gold standard.
Then they nominated a ticket which they
did not intend to vote for. because they were
not willing :o b>-ar the odium of voting for the
Republican ticket. 1 prophesy that the editor
o: the Press does not intend to vote for
Palmer and Buckner. I propht-sy that he In
tends to vote for the Republican ticket anri
that he is receiving money from the Republi
can candidate.
Wtjile most of his speeches contained
practically no new matter, the candidate
made some interesting comments on the
third ticKet and platform here this even
ing. In his Saginaw speech Mr. Bryan
answered the charges that the Chicago
platform is anarchistic, and quo'.ed Jus
tice Brown of the Feaeral Supreme Court,
who was appointed from Michigan, in
support of the alleged attack on that
tribunal.
Detroit exceeded in attendance and
demonstrative appreciation at t c three
meetings beld bore, as was natural in
view of its larger population and tbe
preparations that bad been made for Mr.
Bryan's reception, any reception given tbe
candidate elsewhere during the day.
But the smaller towns and cities showed
how ereat an interest was felt in me Demo
cratic campaign by tbe presence of re
markably enthusiastic crowds, numbering
many thousands at some points. BaY
I City and vicinity, for instance, fnrnishe I
between 15,000 and 20,000. The crowd
of from 8000 to 10,000 at Saginaw greeted
Mr. Bryan entbus.astically. It was (he
! same at Flint, wi h a gathering of about
j 5000, and at Port Huron, where Air. Bryan
! tried to make himself bear â  to 8000 peo
' p!e. The other stops were at Bt. John,
Ovid, Owosso, Durand, Vassar, La Pere,
Imla dry and Mount Clemens.
In the Union Driving Park at Sagi naw
Mr. Bryan made a vigorous speech of an
hour, in which be replied with a display
of considerable feeling to the charge that
tbo Democratic platform was anarchistic.
He said:
I am told that some of your people are very
much concerned for tear the Democrats, In
I their platform, have not been sufficiently con
i fciderate of the Supreme Court of the United
I States. Some of your people are worried be-
I cause there is a plank in the Deinccriitjc plat
form which expresses a desire for an income
tax and which' expresses a hope that the
court at some future day may reconsider the
decision rendered a year agn and will permit
the people of the United State? to make those
who have large incomes pay some ol the ex
penses of the Government. [Loud clifci.Tiiif.]
I want yon to read tbe Democratic platform
on that question, and when you have become
thoroughly frightened by it 1 want you to read
what one of the dissenting Judges said about
that decision. I want to read to you what
justice Brown, wlto was selected from your
own Slate, and iusiead of being an anarchist,
or a Democrat, or a Populist, ora silver Repub
lican, is a Republican, and beirrfc a Republi
can certainly no man ought to accuse him of
not teing sufficiently polite to the Supreme
Court. Let me iead you what he said:
"While I have no doubt that Congress will
find some meant of surmounting the present
crisis, my fear is that in some moment of Na
tional peril this decision will rise up to .frus
trate iv will and paralyze its arm."
Nuw remember these words which I em
about to read: "I nope it may not prove the
first step toward the submergence vt the lib
erti.s of the peopk- in a sordid despotism of
wealth." [Cheers.] My iriends, it was a Re
publican who said that, a Judge of the Su
preme Court of the United States, and while I
am a Democrat I indorse what that Republi
can Judge said, and I think, my friends, that
the policy that lies behind that decision means
a submergence of our liberties in a sordid
despotism of wealth. [Great applause and
cheering.] And before anybody calls me an
anarchist for believing thatl want him to take
an anarchist's badge and pin it on Justice
Brown of the Supreme Court. [Great cheering.]
Mr. Brya.n said that fear had been ex
preseed by the goldbues that the pen
sioner would suff r il be were elected. He
contended that tbe interests of the soldier
could be better trusted to those who be
lieved that this Nation is big enough to
have a financial policy of its own than to
those who believed that foreign creditors
must shapa our financial policy and
foreign influences control the legislation
of tbe United States.
Baskets full of Colonel IngersolPs re
cent Chicago speech attacking the Demo
cratic platform had been distributed
among the crowd awaiting Mr. Bryan's
return to bis train, and tbe people were
engaged in a vigorous mimic batile with
the folded papers as missiles when tbe
nominee and bis wife appeared. In tbe
excitement tbat prevailed Mrs. Bryan was
forgotten and tbe train started witbout
her. She was caught in tbe crush and
could make no headway. Her absence
was discovered almost immediately, how
ever, and as the train baited about 100
yards down the track iLe was discovered

emerging from the throng on the arm of
her excited escort, with a policeman on
the other side.
The stop at Bay City lasted fifty min
utes. The crowd at Va-sar amounted to
about 3000 and heard a few remarks. An
exhibition of fireworks marked Mr.
B-yan's progress from the train to the
City Hall at Huron. Mr. Bryan made a
very short adiiress from the balcony to
8000 people and continued his journey at
5:40 o'clock. Mount Ciemeus, the last
stop before Detroit, gave him a rousing
reception.
Mr. Bryan made three speeches here in
Detroit to-night and tLe aggregate of his
audiences equaled, if it did not exceed,
tbe greatest crowds that saw and beard
him in any city he Las visited. He made
bis first addres3 to a large concourse of
people that completely nlied the spacious
Washington boulevard in front of the
Hotel Cadillac and lapped over into the
adjoining Michigan avenue. State and
Grand River avenues. Mr. Bryan began
to speak at 8 o'ciock, immediately after
his arrival at the Cadillac from his special
train.
At one time the people to his left began
to sway back and forth, and tne excite
ment among those who were buffeted
about and the resistance became so intence
that a panic eeemcl imminent. Women
fainted and bad to be carrisd out, brawny
men fighting for a passage for them. This
increased the contusion, and amid the
shrieks arid screams and &hout3 that came
from the helpless throng the candidate's
voice could not be heard.
It was probably on account of the
threatened danger that he cut his speech
short Â«nd proceeded immediately to the
Auditorium to receive another great dem
onstration.
Bo admirable were the police arrange
ments tbere, as everywhere pise to-night,
tbat the nominee had no difficulty in get
ting into the structure and was able to be
gin his address promptly on time. Mr.
Bryan delivered nis longest and principal
speech of the evenine thÂ»rr, devoting nis
atttntion mainly to tbe Palmer and Buck
ner ticket and plat;orm. One man, Isaac
Adams, a fruit-dealer, died in the excite
mont.
Equally as enthusiastic as the others
was the third assemblage to which Mr.
Bryan spoke. Like that at the Cadillac
it took place in tue open air in front of the
city hall.
The city hall gathering was equal to
that at the Cadillue Hotel. As stated Mr.
Bryan's auditorium speech was the most
important of tbe evening.

FACTS AND FIGURES BOTH.
Republican* Shots That McKinley Will
Surely Be Elected.
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 17.â The Republi
can National Committee to-day issued an
elaborate statement tasing a? a basis
the table given out this week by the
Democratic Congressional Committee,
which showed tne number of Representa
tives ttiey expect to elect, and deducting
from that table the claim that the Demo
crats thus admit the election of JlcKin
ley. The statement iÂ» made:
"It goes without saying that a party
which admits that it cannot elect more
than one-third to one-sixth of the mem
bers of Congress from any given State has
no expectation, of carrying thai State lor
the Presidential nominee. Usually candi
dates for Congress poll a larger number of
votes than the' Presidential candidate,
since every man has his personal friends
to v.horn be can appeal for the certain
Buppori which they would not give for
party reasons."
The Republican committee then goes
on to give a list of the btutcs in which the
Democratic Congressional Committee
claims only part of the Representatives,
and shows that those States give a total
number of 210 Presidential electors, four
teen short of the number necessary to
elect. The Republican managers follow
with a list of tn States not luc'uued as
mentioned, which "ihev are absolutely
confident of currying," as follows: Cali
fornia, Indiana, Kentucky, Kansas Mary
land, Minnesota, Nebraska, the Dakotas,
Washington, West Virginia and lowa,
giving ninety-two additional electoral
votes for MeKinley, or 302 altogether.
Cnairman Hanna and bis colleagues also
give the following States, wnich they be
lieve they stand a "more than even
chance" of carrying: Idaho, Louisiana,
Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Ten
nessee, lexas, Utah and Virginia, a total
of eighty-iour electoral votes. The re
maining sixty-one electoral votes are
classed as "probably Democratic."
Colonel i. H. Bingham, master of the
National Grange and president of the
Ohio Prison Board under Governor Me-
Kinley, arrivad at National headquarters
from an extensive tour among tbe farmers
of lowa. He said he had taken particular
pains to discover the extent of tbe silver
sentiment among Republicans while on
the stump and had not discovered any
more than among the Republican wage
earners in the cities, which was incon
siderable.
Three Ohio Slate officersâ F. 8. Monett,

and S. J. Carapbeil, Treasurerâ called on

SUGGESTS A FLAG DAY
Hanna Favor* a Dinplay of Old Glory
by Patriotic Voter*.
CHICAGO, 11t,., Oct. 17.â Chairman
Hanna of the Republican National Com
mittee has suggested a ''flag day" in the
campaign. He promulgated the following
to-day:
"The American flag has been in the
present campaign the emblem or insignia
of National honor. Its influence has Deen
tor great good in the cause of a good peo
ple. Its display in many places has been
potent in the advancement of the coun
try's battle for the maintenance of its
honor at borne and abroad. I therefore
suggest that on Saturday, October 3l, all
who intend to vote on November 3 for the
preservation of our National honor, for
sound money and the advancement ol our
people's interests and general prosperity,
display the National colors at their
homes, their places of business and wher
ever they may be Been, in order that their
purpose and those who are undetermined
may the more patriotically and intelli
gently conclude bow best to perform their
duty as citizens."

ALTGELD MAKES A
DEBUT IN GOTHAM
Given a Warm Greeting by
Silverites of the Ger
man Democracy.
Five Minutes of Wild Applause
When the Illinois Gov
ernor Appeared.
ASSAILS THE GDLD STANDARD
And Tries to Justify the Anarchistic
Planks in the Chicago
Platform.
NEW YORK, N. V., Oct. 17.â Governor
Altgeld of Illinois made his debut in this
city to-niglit at the mass-meeting beld in
Cooper Union under the auspices of the
German Democracy of New York City.
When the famous Governor appeared
upon the platform, flanked by the officers
of the meeting, ibe audience arose as one
man and cheered and cheered until it grew
hoarse of voice.
The cheering broke from them like a
mighty cyclone, swiried, eddied and beat
in enthusiastic fury until tired nature
would permit no more. Then it lulled it
self to prepare for another outburst. The
second came when Congressman William
Sulzer introduced the Governor as the
"Tribune of the Middle West." Standing
on tbeir seats, and yelling like madmen,
waving little flags and bannerettes, the
entire audience broke forth in cheer after
cbeer.
The applause fell and rose alternately
for fully five minutes. Henry George was
among those who were applauded by the
crowd present.
After a speech by Fred Schrautz, the
Democratic candidate for Lieutenant-Gov
ernor, who acted as chairman, the follow
ing telegram was read:
BIG RAPIDS, Mich., Oct. 17, 189Â«>.â A cor
dinl greeting to the German-Americans. Free
coinage at 16 to 1 without waiting for other
nations will .urnish a sounder currency than
is possible under a gold standard, and wi.l, in
the language of Bismarck, exert a most salu
tary influence in restoring bimeta lisin
throughout the world. W. J. Beyan.
Congressman Sulzer made a somewhat
lengthy speech, eulogistic of the Illinois
Governor, and When be closed witb the
formal introduction and the chief speaker
stepped forward the audience cheered for
fully five minutes.
In bis remarks Governor Altgeld said:
I have come to bring the patriotic people of
New York and of the East the greeting of
the great Mississippi Valley; of ttiat hard yeo
manry of the Central and Western Stales that
has always rallied to the support of the Ameri
can flag in times of danger and that supports
and maintains our institutions in times of
peace. Those great toiling and producing:
masses who make our civilization possible feel
that their destiny 1s linked with thf sons of
liberty who inhabit the Enst We are unwill
ing to believe out in the West that patriotism
has died east of the Aileghanies and that
Mammon is the only god at whose shrine
Easttrn people bow. We are unwilling to be
lieve that the few men in your large cities
who use the Government as a convenience to
make fortunes, who use our Republic as a
mere ioraeing ground to amass wealth, who
cringe to European aristocracy, and who wave
the American flag with one hand while rob
bing the public with the other, represent the
sentiment of that section of the country that
was the cradle of American liberty.
We do not believe because you have in your
midst men who viilue the privilege ot taking
breakfast with the Prince of Wales more than
they do the blessings of free government;
th*i because you have In your midst men who
are re tdy to undermine and to overthrow re
publican institutions in our land in order to
t/inn a temporary personal advantage for
themselves, that therefore the fires of liberty,
whic.i for more than a century burned upon
your hill tops and illumined the world, are ex
tinct. We believe that the hearts of a majority
o; your people are loyal to the Institutions of
the* atlier.-, a:d that they beat in unison with
the hearts of tne great people of the South and
West, who believe that the time has not come
for converting tills republic into an oligarchy.
At present there is in addition to the gold
standard a quartet of blighting sisters in our
land, respectively called: "Federal interfer
ence in local affairs," "oovernment by in
junction," "Usurpation by the United States
Supreme Court" and fourth, "Corruntion."
All|four are clothed in Pharisaism and pre
tense and all recognize the gold standard as
their natural or foster mother. We believe
that these blighting sisters, whose smile means
paralysis and whose embrace means death,
nave no more admirers among your people
than they have among ours.
This campaign Is to decide not only whether
we shall perpetuate the experiment of this
English financial system, which is prostrating
our Nation, but also whether we shall per
manently adopt these lour sisters into our
household and make thum the ruling mem
bers of the family.
Themask has been torn from the gold stan
dard. Our people are beginning to under
stand the attempt to introduce it throughout
the commercial world is a disastrous experi
ment; that down to 1873 the world used not
only all the gold x lid all the silver as money,
but so great was the world's business that
every dollar was loaded with twenty times as
much credit; that all the great achievements
of mankind were accomplished under the bi
metallic system; that under this syst9m every
thing that makes the civilization of this cen
tury was done, and that since the introduc
tion of the universal standard the wheels of
progress have itood still.
Our people ere beginning to understand
that formerly there were added every year to
the world's stock of money nearly all of the
gold and silver that was mined, which in a
measure kept pace with the increase of popu
lation, but that since 1873 only the gold has
been addedâ that is, only half as much has
been added each year as there formerly was,
while tbe population has increased more
rapidly than ever, and that this fact alone
must produce a continuous fall in prices.
Our pet pie are beginning to understand
that making money scarce makes money dear,
tnat dear money tnsaus low prices for prop
erty, for the products of the earth and for the
products of labor. They further understand
that as taxes and debts were not reduced low
prices have destroyed the purchasing-power
of the farming and producing classes so that
they can no longer buy the products of the
fai-tory and the mill us they formerly did, jn
consequence of which tbe factory mid the mill
had to per; sally or wholly shut down, thus in
turn destroying the purchasing-power of the
laborer^atid that in this manner the gold
standard has spread paralysis, not only over
America, but over Europe and the civilized
world.
Our people understand that when the gov
ernments of the earth forced the world off
the bimetallic standard of prices down to
tbe low gold-standurd prices they practically
doubled the burden of all debtors, and that,
strange as it may teem, none of the Pharisees
who now cry aloud against making money
Cheap and Injuring the creditor ever uttered
a word oi sympathy for the poor debtor. They
understand that the bul ion in one of the so
cailed "50-cent dollars"â treated as bullion
with the stamp of the Government erasedâ has
substantially the same purchasing power and
will buy as much property, as much of the
products of the earth and of labor as had or
did any of the dollars which the Englishmen
gave us for our bonds. They understand that
the gold dollur has been forced up to where it
will buy twice as much property and products
as it formerly did; that the governments by
destroying silver reduced the world's supply
of money, and by making gold alone do the
world's work they increased the demand of it,
tfaus interfering with the law of supply and
demand, and that as soon us this leci-iauou is
wiped out gold will ol necessity come down to
its former position.
Our people understand that it will be im
poss bie to open the mills aua restore pros
perity to the world until the purchasing
powir of the farming and the preat producing
c asses of the earth is restored and that this
can oniy be done by putting an end to this
Kola .standard experiment and restoring bi
metallism.
Governor Altgeld spoke on Federal in
terference at great length and cited tbe
action of the Federal Government and the
Federal courts during the railroad strike
in 1894. He said:
I am aware that by persistent vilification
and deliberate misrepresentation the partisan
press has made tbe impression upon the minds
of many (rood citizens 'that I. as governor of
Illinois, during the railroad disturbances of
two years ago did not do my du'y and did not
make the proper effort 10 protect life and
property in Chicago, but sympathized with
lawlessness and disorder; that Federal inter
ference was necessary to save the city. If
there were even a semblance of truth in this
then no condemn*tion could be too severe,
for a Government that will uot promptly and
thorough iy protect lite and property and pre
serve order is an abomination and should be
wiped off the earth.
He then narrated the incidents in tbe
strike at Cbicago. and read the correspond
ence between himself and the State De
portment, adding:
An examination of the facts shows that Mr.
Olney and Mr. Cleveland had decided to re
verse the policy and practice of the Govern
ment, aua take an entirely new departure by
setting a precedent of having the President
to interfere at pleasure, and having the United
States courts and the United States Govern
ment take the corporations directly under
their wines in the first instance in all cases,
and in order to have the American people sub
mit to the violation of the constitution aid
laws of the land as well as of every principle
ot seli-government. the trouble at Chicago
was, by systematic effort and deliberate mis
representation, so magnified as to make it
seem that we were bordering on anarchy and
that consequently Federal interference was
necessary.
The impression was sought to be made upon
the country that we were bordering on civil
war and the destruction of society and that
neither the local authorities nor the State
authorities were willing to mi: in tain law and
order, while the real fact was that the Federal
Government took steps to interfere in Chicago
bf-K.re there whs any rioting or any serious
trouble of any kind and that the State authori
ties who stood ready to act promptly were in
tentionaily ignored.
No campaign ever mede in this country in
volved so nirtiiy far-reachinz questions as this
one does. Questions, every one of which goes
to the foundation of free government and
affects the perpetuity of our institutions:
First â The question whether ttie people have
surrendered me right of self-government into
the hands of the Supreme Courfof the United
States and whether the courts are thus placed
above criticism and their acts exempt from
that scrutiny which every patriotic and intel
ligent man should give to the acts of the other
branches of the Government.
Sec n dâ Whether both the constitution and
the traditions of tne Government shall hence
forth be ignored, and the President shall be
conceded the power ot sending Federal troops
at his pleasure Into any neighborhood iv the
United States, or 1000 neighborhoods at one
time; troops who wili not be subject to the
civil authorities nor to the local huthoritieg;
who are under instructions from Washington;
whether ttiis can be done not only without
the request of ihe local authorities, tut in de
fiance oi thorn?
Thirdâ Whether the people of this country,
and. especially the laboring masses who do
not have much of a voice in the selection of
judges, shall recognize and thus perpetuate
the system of governing by injunction, which
does away with constitutional government,
which does away with government by
law, does away with trial by jury,
does away with trial according to the
forms of law and substitutes tne caprice,
\\ him, preju tice or passion of a Judge for alh
these, making him at once legislator, Judge
and to a certain extent executioner; and
whether the Biitish monetary policy si. all be
made perpetual, so that the toiling and pro
ducing masses of this country will be reduced
in their purchasing power; will be reduced
in the end to a lower plane of civilization:
will be reduced in the end to the conditions of
the men who till tDe fields of Europe or the
valley of the Nile.
In conclusion Mr. Altgeld said:
My fellow-citizens, if you are not in favor of
converting this Republic into an oligarchy, it
you believe that this country should at least
be in part governed by the men who toll and
not lol^ly and alone governed by the men
who devour the fruit that others toll for, then
rise in your manhood, stand out In the sun
and before the Almighty ueclare, as did the
fathers over a hundred years ago, tbat we are
not only a free but we are an independent
people.
Declare yourself to be In favor of that policy
under which the mints shail again be opened
to both of the metals 60 that there will be an
end to this destructive fail in prices; so that
prudent men will again feel that it is safe to em
bark in new enterprises. If y> v believe in the
institutions of the satners and in perpetuating
them, then go to the polls on the 3d oi Novem
ber and make a new declaration of independ
ence and there will follow another century,
which, in grandeur and glory and in achieve
ments and the blessings to be showered upon
mankind, will surpass the century that is
closing.
WANT IRISH TO SPEAK.
But the Colonel XÂ» Too BuÂ»y to Cump on
Bryan's Trail.
CHICAGO. 111., Oct. 17.â Vice-Chai
rman Hopkins of the National Democratic
party's campaign committee received a
letter ro day from Euclid Martin, the
leader of the Palmer forces in Nebraska,
urging him to send John P. Irisn of Cali
fornia to tbat State to follow the route
which will be taken by Mr. Bryan Novem
ber 2 lor 300 miles and to speak at all tbe
places the silver champion does, winding
up witb a night meeting in Omaha. Mr.
Martin states: "Nebraska is in a fair polit
ical condition, with the chances in favor
ot the electoral vote being cast for sound
money. This tour of November 2 wiil
probably have some effect in Bryan's favor
and we wish to do what we can to check
it."
The engagements made for Colonel Irish
will probably prevent his being sent to
camp on the silver candidate's trail, but
another speaker will be sent. In view of
the encouraging Nebraska situation it was
practically settled to-day at headquarters
that Generals Palmer and Buckner will
go to Omaha and maybe to Lincoln.

THE PRESIDENT
District Attorney Clayton of
Alabama Ousted in
Short Order.
Refused to Heed Harmon's Warn
ing Not to Participate
in Politics.
A CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS.
As Such He Supported the Chicago
Platform and Made Speeches
to Constituents-
. WASHINGTON, D. C, Oct. 17.â Henry
D. Clayton, United States Attorney for
the Middle District of Alabama, was to
day summarily removed from office by the
President. J Mr. Clayton was a delegate to
the Chicago convention, is now a candi
date for Congress from the Second District
of Alabama and is a son-in-law of Senator
Pugh of that State. Assistant District
Attorney C. F. Moore has been placed in
charge of the office. .
Some interesting correspondence led up
to to-day's action by the President. Earlp
in October Attorney-General Harmon
wrote Mr. Clayton a - letter stating that
newspaper clippings ana letters snowed
that he was a candidate for Congress and
his duties as District Attorney made the
positions conflict with each other. To this
letter no reply was received. On October
8 Attorney-General â  Harmon - wrote Mr.
Clayton another letter in which he as
sumed the this ' first letter had not been
received ; by ' Mr. Clayton. He repeated
much of his first letter in substance, and
concluded: "Please advise me upon re
ceipt of this what yon . propose to do in
view of the rule which makes your candi
dacy for another office inconsistent with
the holding of your present position."
Mr. Clayton, on October 14. replied from
Montgomery, Ala., to this last letter of
Attorney-General Harmon. He states
that he was the regular nominee of the
Democratic party from the Montgomery
district for Congress, and was engaged in
the discharge of his duties as District At
torney ; that be bad beard of no com
plaints as to bis neglecting bis work, but
that be was making speeches in behalf of
bis candidacy. He concluded as follows :
"I am not aware that any of the duties
of my office have been neglected. I have
thought that ' a man, though an office
bolder, had the right of free speech and
the right to aspire to represent the people.
I do not believe that my retention of the
office of District Attorney should preclude
me from those rights of citizenship which
are enjoyed by my fellow-citizens. I
therefore respectfully decline to admit
that my candidacy for Congress is incon
sistent or incompatible with my present
position."
Attorney-General Harmon laid the cor
respondence before the President, and at 2
o'clock this telegram was sent:
Department OP JUSTICE. {

â¢pert to nominations for Congress by no less
limn three United States aito.-neys this year,
namelyâ Andrew F. Fox of Northern District
of MUxiÃsippi and Cornelius 3. Wells of Dis
trict of West Virginia, both of whom volunta
rily resigned their offices to accept nomina
tion* for offices, and Wiiliam B.Childers of the
Diitrict of New Mexico, who declined to be
come a candidate for office because of the rule.
You seem, from your letter, not to know or to
lack appreciation of the o'viout reasons upon
which this rule is founded. I attempted,
briefly, to mention some of them in a letter
dated June 11 last to the Hon. Edward C- Wal
tha.l.one of the Senators from Mississippi,
who bad communicated wita me on the sub
ject in behaif of Mr. Fox. Among other things
I wrote :
''Engaged as be is in the prosecution of
OSeodfini again-it the Government and in tha
collection of claim!) due it, some embarrass
ment would naturally arise during a canvass
in which he would be tolicitlng the votes of
wltnciwes and partieÂ«. While in the case of an
honorable Hud upright man like Mr. Fox the
public .interests would not suffer, a precedent
would be formed which might arise, as prece
dent* have, to vex the department hereafter.
My observation is that the dangerous prece
dent* would hardly be made in bad cases.
Moreover, there is always room lor the charge
that tne repeated and prolonged absences and
the demand on bodily and menta 1 vigor which
the makin? of acampalzu imposes, especially
In a Presidential year, would afford ground
for criticism based upon aheged neglect of offi
cial dutief. While 1 am sure Mr. Fox would
not in fact neglect any duty for tbe sake of his
canvass, it is sometimes necessary for officers
connected with the Dypartmeut of Justice to
avoid appearances as well hs realities."
In a recent letter to Mr. Lasslter, United
States Attorney for the eastern district of Vir
ginia, which was widely published, I had occa
sion to tretu of the same subject in connection
with the United States attorneys acting as
members of campaign committees, which let
ter has doubtleiw reached your eye. You must
have been aware when you wrote your letter
of the instances which I have named above,
in which this wholesome rule was recogrizeS
and acquiesced in by others. It must bavd
been quite apparent to you, therefore, thae
your ietter in which you say "I therefore re
spectfully decline to admit that my candidacy
tor Congress is inconsistent or incompatible
with my present position" would make your
prompt removal necessary, not only tn pre
serve the discipline ot the department, but
also to keep faith with the other officers I have
named. The references fn your letter to the
right of free speech, etc, are so manifestly
irrelevant tnat no reply seems necessary.
Very respectfully, Judson Harmon,
Attorney-General.

Linotype Machines-
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.. Oct. 17.â
The convention of the International Typo

city to-day and the delegates will leave for
their various homes to-morrow and the
next day. A big excursion composed of
them will leave for Denver in the morn
ing and a few hoars will be spent in that
city.
The business transacted at the sessions
to-day was of great importance to the
printing trade in general. The matter of
removing the National headquarters was
fuliy discussed and by a vote of the dele
gates it was decided to leave them at In
dianapolis.
A charter was refused the machinists
and the printers will be permitted to have
full charge of and the operating of tbe
Linotype machines. The Canadian print
ers will be allowed $250 with w: ich to
lobby a measure through the Assembly
amending the copyright law. The execu
tive council was instiucted to assist the St.
Paul printers in their strike. An assess
ment of 50 cents en each member of the
union was ordered for tbe purpose of mak
ing an addition, to tbs Printers' Home in
this city.
At the conclusion of the session this
evening an expression of thanks was ex
tended to the city for courteous treatment,
and tbe convention disbanded to meet two
years hence at Syracuse, N. Y.

NEW YORK, N. Y.,Oct. 17.-Henry E.
Abbey, the operatic and theatrical man
ager, died suddenly this morning at bi<
home in Osborne Flat House. He had
been in bad health since early in the
summer. At that time he and his wife
had concluded to separate, and shortly
after the operatic firm of Abbey. ScuoeÃel
& Grau failed.
Abbey's poor health took on a critical
phase early Wednesday morning, when he
HENRY E. ABBEY, the Noted Operatic and Theatrical Manager,
Who Died Suddenly Yesterdayr
was attacked with hemorrhage of the
stomach. All efforts to check the ailment
proved futile. Shortly after 2 o'clock he
became unconscious and died in a little
while. The funeral will take place next
Tuesday. The interment will be in North
ampton, Mass.
Henry E. Abbey was born in Akron,
Ohio, in 1846. He learned the trade of
jeweler irom his father, who was in the
jewelry business and who bequeathed him
bis business. Having musical tastes Ab
bey soon gave up mercantile business and
became manager of a summer opera
house, a venture that turned out disas
trously. Subsequently he went into the
box-office of the Euclid Avenue Opera
house at Cleveland under the veteran
John Ellsler, and still later became treas
urer for Ellsler's Opera-house at Pittsburg.
He became very popular in the the
atrical business and soon had a number
of offers to take charge of the tours of
prominent professionals. Of these offers
he selected that made by Lctta.
In 1889 he brought Sarah Bernhardt
and her company to this country at a
preat expense. Then, secure in his new
fame, Abbey, in conjunction with
Scho ftel. became interested in operatic
affairs and brought over Niisson, Patti,
Langtrv and Irving.
Their fame as managers increased, and
in 1893 Gvau was taken into the firm in ad
dition and plans were made for a mag
nificent grand opera season. When the
firm oecured the Metropolitan Opera
house it was its ambition to give grand
opera. This ambition was realized.
The history of the brilliant managerial
career of Abbey is inseparably linked with
the glories ana reverses ot the Metropol
itan Opera-house. On May 23 the theat
rical world^and public was astonished to
hear of the failure of Abbey, Schoeffel <fe
Grau.
Henry E. Abbey will be a loss to the
theatrical and musical* world. He was
the greatest plunger the profession has
known. He took tremendous risks and
odds on anything in ins line. To him
we owe the original Bernhardt and
Irving seasons in America, and most of
the leading European celebrities made
their first American appearance under
Abbey's management. He also had
several of the most prominent American
stars and companies on his list.
The Metiorolitan Opera Company,
which for three years ha 3 charmed tbe
Eastern cities, was another of Abbey's
daring ventures. He handled hun
dreds of thousands of dollars in connec
tion with this venture. Only last season
he was involved in financial trouble,
threatening failure, through the immense
sums expended in opera salaries and pro
ductions. It was through this opera
scheme that he lost to Al Hayman the
Knickerbocker Theater of this city. Mr.
Abbey was ill since lasi sprine, at
times his condition being aangerous.
Lately he seemed better and his
death was not expected. Mr. Abbey and
his wife, formerly Florence Gerard,
recently separated and the talk tnat en
sued affected tbe sick man seriously. He
leaves one daughter by his first wife and
prob.ibly no :ortune, lor in his desire to be
the Napoleon of managers he sacrificed his
private affairs at every turn. Mr. Abbey's
death will probably not interfere with ihe
opera season about to open, as Grau and
Schoeffel, his partners, have been manag
ing the business sine Abbey's illness.

WATSON IN GREAT DEMAND.
Democratic Leaders Hastening to Confer
With the Georgian.
THOMSON, Ga., Oct. 17.^1t is probable
that the next forty-eight hours will fur
nish some interesting political news from
Georgia.
When the fast train from Atlanta
reached Thomson last night Mr. Watson's
carriage was in waiting at the station, and
three gentlemen who emerged from the
train entered the carriage and were rapidly
driven to Mr. Wntson's home.
They were Evan P. Howell. James A.
Robertson and J. J. Hunt, Democratic
nominees for electors from the State at
large. They spent the night nt Mr. Wat
son's home and he accompanied them to
the depot this morning.
The visitors and Mr. Watson declined to
speak on the subject of their conference,
but the visit following immediately upon
the proposition of the Populists for fusion
in Georgia it was generally surmised that
this was the topic of discussion.
Since their departure it has been gath
ered that the scope of the conference
covered a broader field than the
Georgia fusion, and had in view bringing
Watson and Chairman Jones, with pos
>ibly other members of the National
Democratic * Committee, together in At
lanta on Monday. Mr. Watson when
questioned about this rumor said:
"If t c gentlemen who called upon me
declined to say anything about the pur
pose of their visit, manifestly it would be
improper foj me to do so. :>
"If ii is true that you are going to At
lanta on business on Monday,- will Messrs. 5
Reed and Wash burn await you there or
will they come on to Thomson ?"
â¢ "I expect them here to-morrow and
have so telegraphed Mr. Reed to Atlanta,
where he will be to-night."
"If Chairman Butler does not give your
letter to the press to-day, will you then
m; ke it public?"
'"I will not make, any statement con
cerning it until after my conference with
the members of the National Committee
from Chicago."
''If Chairman Butler has not in the
meantime made your letter public will
you do so after your conference with
Messrs. Reed and Wash burn?"
"1 cannot say." .
This ended the interview, but there can
be no question about the "coutem plated
conference between F Chairman Jones and
Mr. . Watson in " Atlanta and ; there
is reason to believe that it has some
thine 'to do with ; the situation
in Kansas and possibly to getting Mr.

ROSEBERY'S COOP
A FLAT FAILURE
Liberals Willing to Get Rid
of His Lordship, the
Leader.
In Contrast Was the Brilliant
Work of Sir William Ver
non Harcourt.
DUMFCUNDED ALL OPPONENTS.
Frederic Criticizss the Career of Arch
bishop Benson and Speculates

(Copyright, 1896, by t' â¢ New - Times. 1
LONDON, Eng., Oct. 17.â Lord Rose
bery's coup has not been even a nine days'
wonder. To sp ( ak accurately, it evapo
rated on the sixth day, and it is exiremely
safe to promise that a week hence not an
echo of it will disturb the political atmos
phere. It is true (hat for the first three
days or so a tremendous hullabaloo was
raised over his Lordship's resignation of
the Liberal leadership, and many timid
people were frightened into believing that
the party was dead beyond recovery unless
he coul 1 bÂ« induced to withdraw it. This,
however, was n.erely because the little
group of place-seekers and Whig snobs
who had staked everything on Lord Rose
bery's favnr promptly raised a howl so
strenuous as to confuse the public judg
ment. When this interested wail subsided
the voices of the real party fighters began
to be heard, and then it was a matter of a
few hours for the situation to clear itself.
Under the earlier impression that the
shouts of Lord Roaebery's squad of re
tainers had unnerved the whole party a
hurried emergency meeting of the Na
tional Liberal Federation managers was
summoned. They raced to London, im
agining that it would be an easy matter to
hustle the Liberal party into a penitential
mood, and lead it out, cmdle in hand, to
implore hia Lordship to forget and forgive.
To their amazement, they found seven
Liberal members of Parliament out of
every ten saying that it was a good rid
dance, and two more wavering toward the
same opinion. The managers met, ex
changed sacred confidence , passed a
wholly non-committal resolution and hur
riedly dispersed. W T ith their departure
R seberyism faded away like a wreath of
mist.
That it will not reappear is too much
to say. Snobbery and political cowardice
are inherent in the human breast, and th â¢
Liberal party of England has more than
its share ol both; but I doubt if precisely
the same unworthy game can ever be
played again.
Only two months aso England was talk
ing of one of the most remarkable ses
sions then just ended in modern English
parliamentary history. A ministry
marshaling the largest majority known
since the time of the reform bill had
fought from February to August, and had
sustained an almost all-round defeat. Of
ten contested measures which it hart
brought in, only two had been carried
througn. On its chief measure, the edu
cation bill, it has been utterly routed from
the field. None dare deny that the hero
of this extraordinary se&sion was Sir Wil
liam Vernon Harcourt.
Though neartng his seventieth year he
had never 1 'ft his post for an hour, even
when the sessions had lasted through tha
night tmd till noon next day. His leader
ship was as superb and unquestioned on
the intellectual as the physical side. He
emerged from the final contest like a giant
refreshed, and the Liberals, who had en
tered the session dismayed and utterly
hopeless, came out behind him dura
founded at the s ries of triumphs through
which he had left them. In that hour of
victory one never heard Lord Rosebery's
name mentioned except by way ol won
dering how most easily to get rid of him.
He bad contributed absolutely nothing to
his part3 T 's triumphs, and no one thought
of him except as an incumbrance, to be
unloaded when tbe convenient time came.
As soon as the session ended, however,
the party managers began tryin â¢ to mini
mize Sir William Harcourt's work and to
arrange an occasion for bringing Lord
Rosebery forward again as their chief.
The Darty Itself took this with indifference
until it suddenly discovered a wrong note
in Lord Rosebery's talk about Armenia.
It listened then more attentively, and be
gan to get angry. Then Mr. Gladstone
swooped down and laid bare to the
party's gaze wnat Lord Rosebery was try
ing to do. Thereafter there was no course
open for him except to get out. As 1 have
said, those who were too deeply com
mitted to Lord Rosebery's fonunes to
change sides at an hour's notice set up a
noisy clamor, but that has died away, and
nothing remains now of the conspiracy of
18y3 except a bad taste in the Liberal
mouth.
By the time Parliament meets again Sir
William Harcourt's position as leader of
the Liberal party wi.l be no more ques
tioned than is his natural captaincy of its
forces in t c House of Commons.
For some unexplained reasons ail the
precedents thnt have been accumulating
since the reformation were set aside in the
Durial of Archbishop Benson in Canter
bury Cathedral. None of his predecessors
of Protestant creation lies, there to bear
him company. At the time of the great
upheaval the spoliation of Becket's mag
nificent and then surpassingly rich shrine
at Canterbury produced a deep impression
in England. The early Archbishops ol
the new order, though they bore the Can
terbury title and insisted on their apos
tolic succession, wisely managed to see as
little as possible of Canterbury itself and
would not have dared to seek sepulture
there.
This grew into a habit, and why after
350 years the rule is broken now no one
seems *o know. It is certain enough, how
ever, that a lew years hence this fact that
Dr. Benson, in his burial, seta new fashion
will be about the only thing remembered
of him. The gushing floods of eulogy in
the press do not conceal rom anybody the
truth that he was a very paltry kind of a
prelate. Perhaps the Queen's description
of him as "the dear, kind, excellent
Archbishop" best hits off the popular
conception of him.
His trimming instincts led Dr. Benson
to patch up a peace between the various
factions of the church, and especially to
make the ritualists and evangelicals preÂ»
tend to shake hands and be fri nds.
This oily smothering of differences pro
duced a semblance of harmony inside the
establishment, but it was at a heavy cost
of intellectuality and spiritual vigor. Dr.
Benson leaves the English church to the
eye more prosperous and contented than
h9 found it, but with a sorely weakene i
hold upon the liking and respect of Eng
lishmen as a whole. Speculaiion as to
Dr. Benson's successor revolves around a
:ew names â those of the Bishops of Win
chester, Rochester, Peterborough and
Ripon â but the question is really all in
the dark. It miglu not be impossible to
argue out what L.ord Saisbury's choice
would be, but these are matters on which
the Queen is very tenacious of lyr pre
rogatives, and where her fancy may alight
heaven onlyTcnows.
There have been numerous indications
lately of friction between the Queen and
Lord Salisbury on personal select ons of
this sort. At least one of the two does not
grow more pliable with age, and this fact
alone would render the matter one of pure
guesswork.
There is still a lingering doubt in the
minvis of the Liberals as to whether Glad
stone is quite certain not to be seized by a
whim for returning to Parliament him
seif, and thus complicating everything.
Auv number of seats wonld, ot course, be
at his disposal if he wanted one.
Pritchard Morpan has been reported as
intending to resign for Merthyr Tydvil in
order to offer Mr. Gladstone bis place, but
what he is really going to do is to hold a
meeting of his constituents on Wednes
day and let them say whether they
would like to have this done or not
All at once and without any warning
the English and ihe Germans find them
selves engaged in a violent newspaper
war, which threatens to be at least as
embittered in spirit and as extravagant in
tone as that over the Transvaal affair in
January lr.sr. One cannot say that it was
precipitated from a clear sky, because the
European heavens have been blackly
overhung in every direction during the
whole of this troubled year, but it takes
people by surprise none the less.
The journalistic combats as a rule im
press Englishmen hardly at all, because
the British have been abused somewhere
and are used to it. With Germans, how
ever, it is the exception to be made the
object of attack. Since the row of last
winter Englishmen have been rather
anxious than otherwise to take offense in
that quarter, and the present concerted
onslaught of the German "repiiie press"
on Englanrt, although de iberaiely pro
voked by Tnursday's London Times, is
treated here wiih almost as much gravity
as if the Kaiser were writing the attacks
with his own hand. .This very swiuness
to umbrage on the one side only inflames
the rage of the other, but, wh.le the Ger
man preÂ«B can always be called eff by the
German Foreign Office, that is not at all
true of the English press. On the contrary,
any sincere and vehement outburst of
journalistic passion here not only cirries
the people along with it, but generally
the Government as well.
This tierce anti-British demonstration
is most important for thd moment, how
ever, asthrowin_ light on certain obscure
places in the diplomatic situation. From
the tone of the London Times and the
fury it has yoked, one gathers that Eng
land has really arranged some line of
joint action with Russia and France.
The very vehemence of the German pro
test that such a thing is impossible and
that both the Russians and the French
are incapab eof being such idiots as to
lorget that England is their chief rival
and enemy, shows how scared Berlin is
over what it knows has happened or is
happenine. To make the mutters worse,
the inspired German editors declare that
England has been intriguing at Rome to
detach Italy from the triple alliance.
That is old news to the readers of these
dispatches, but the Germans do not know
â what is really trueâ that these intrigues
have been moie than half successful.
It was announced a month ago, for in
stance, that Emperor William woul 1 per
sonally attend the marriage of the Princ
of Naples to Princess Helene of Monte
negro. Ten days hence and plans for his
reception had been drawn up. Now it is
learned that William was notified last
week by the King of Italy that as the
marriage is to be a purely family affair no
foreign guests are expected. The news of
this affront reached the Germans by way
of Balmoral, and it is this that served as
the spark in the powder magazine.
Advice comes to me from a very good
quarter to say tha: the Venezuelan mat
ter has been settled. No reasons for the
statement are given. Indeed, it is said
that there are none which could be de
fined, but that, all the same, it is true.
It is understood in Germany, as I gather
fiom private letters, that Bismarck's
health is again in a rather alarming state.
Of a serious disorder there is no hint, but
the Prince has once more been attacked
by a facpac: c which keeps him awake at
night. When Bismarck does not sleep
well he thinks be is going to die and he
then gets into a state of depression,
which gives the doctors their chief
anxiety.
The annual gauntlet which the music
hall proprietors of London have publicly
to run between rows of elderly British
matrons armed with umbrellas afforded
the usual amount of popuiar entertain
ment this week, but it was lacking in that
spice of danger to the show people which
it had in the tnree previous years.
It is well known that the existing
county council committee takes a lenient,
not to say g nerous, view of "art" as prac
ticed in ..be halls, and there is no danger
that any licenses will be with eld. The
lawyers defending these licenses were,
theie ore, quite genial with their Puritan
assailants, and utilized the cross-examina
tions solely in the interest of sport.
The prolonged rainy weather has made
a wonderful season for indoor entertain
ments of all sorts, but most of all for the
music halls, and for light, silly musical
farces. They all continue to coin money,
as well in London as in the provinces.
The memoirs which General Trochu left
are ready for the printer, and will appear
without much delay. They will be inter
esting mainly for their violent attacks on
the Empress Eugenic. Trochu went to
his grave with the solemn conviction that
she was ihe instrument used by provi
dence to chastize sinful France and he
says plainly, besides giving a great deal
of testimony, some of it new, to support
this attitude. It seems that the Empress
distrusted the general on account of a be
lief that he was secretly devoted to the
Orleanist Princess, and t at she allowed
this base ess suspicion fataily to handicap
him in his efforts to save the empire. It
is a curious comment on time's whirligig
that Eugenic should be believed in France
to be hand-in-glove with the Orleanist in
triguers. Recognized Bcnapartists told
me when I was in Paris last week that
they knew this to be true.
Augustus Hare's memoirs, or the first
half of them rather, will contain a large
number of mildly flavored plum 3, which
will be very useful to reviewers, but the
latter are unkind enough to explain that
in order to get these Hums out they bad
to dig tnroug'i preat masses of extremely
dull stuff. It seems to be the consensus of
critical opinion that the book should have
been boiled down to half its present size,
but at the same time the glimpses of it
given by the published extracts are un
doubtedly entertaining.
Vast editions are becoming more and
more the rule as the area of England's
new novel reading class expands. Unwin
throve 35,000 copies of Crockett's 'Gray
Men" into tiie market in a lump and Skei
fington got 36,0000f Marie Corelli's ridicu
lous "Murder of Deiicia" subscribed in
advance of publication. By combining
English and American subscriptions we
get. too, a first edition of 45,000 for lan
MacLaren's " Kate Carnegie." These
figures a few years ago would have been
regarded as incredible, now they scarcely
attract attention.
With scarcely an exception the popular
novels of the past year have appeared
from the outset in the single- volume form.
The old i hree-yolume system seems to be
dead and buried, and yet Henry James'
new tale, "The Other House," makes its
appearance in the library edition in two
volumes. This is all the odder, because
he used to be the single-volume exception
to the prevalent route. In any form, how
ever, "T c Other House" must take a
powerful grip on readers of intelligence.
It is quite out ide his usual method. A
terrible story is told in the terms of the
come ly, almost to the end, and the cli
max : s of unique force.
Munkacsv did after all, it seems, seed
down roots Â«iuring his long sojourn in
Paris, and the pulling up of them has
hurt him, perhans to death. The painter
left for his native land last spring with
glowing plans foi a renewed career as the
greatest man in Hungary. Budji-Pesth
was eager to do its shar<- in realizing this
vision, but at the sart there was a cruel
hitch. Munk.acsy's health gave way as
soon as he entered Hungary. He was forced
to goto Badrn Baden for the summer,
without receiving much benefit, and now
the Hungarian papers report that he is
worse, and unlikely ever to paint again.

Isolation
GROWS OUT OF NEW ALLIANCE
Stories of an Agreement Between
England, Russia an France That
Are Not Relished.
BERLIN, Germany, Oct. 17.â Although
no facts are known which indicate the
slightest change in the coolly courteous
relations which for some time past have
existed betw en Germany and Great
Britain, the sudden outburst of strong
anti - British opinion which has been
jdned in by the German newspapers of
all parties has become the leading topic
of discussion in political circles. De
nunciation of England's selfis mess and
arrogance, allusion to her isolation and
suggestions of how to diminish the pre
tensions of Great Britain appear in the
North German Gazette, the Cologne Ga
zette and other organs of less importance,
with a degree of unanimity which gives
the idea that the utterances emanate from
some common and responsible source. If
these attacks had in reality any official
origin their line of argument would be
worth quoting, but it is emphatically de
nied at the Foreign Office that there is
the slightest foundation for the prevail
ing rumors of an alteration in the rela
tions between the German and English
Governments.
Apari from such denial on the part of
the Foreign Office scrutiny into the cause
of the present boiling over of the German
press proves that it is not foundeu upon
anything whatever that is guing on be
tween the Berlin and London Govern
ments, but that it is purely and simply a
case of newspaper war in which the
journals are allowed unlimited license, the
Government not caring now far they
may go.
What these newspapers are saying now
arose from the publication of articles in
tne leading London papers reporting tbe
possible establishment of an English, Rus
sian and French alliance, with tbe detach
ment of Italy from the Dreibund. The
German journalists who are guiding the
tone of the beat papers in Germany are
quite conversant with the truth of what
an English preacher, now deceased, once
said, that English politics is not guided
by such bare-brained chatter and irrespon
sible fr.volity. But coming on the heels
ol the jubilant articles of the French
papers in view of the recent visit of the
Czar and Czarina to Pans, the siyle of the
comments indu.ged in by the British press
was felt to be intolerable, and to demand
some notice.
Tne practical significance of this vol
canic eruption of criticism on the part of
the German papers, however, lies in the
tendency to heighten Get man hatred
toward England, enabling the Govern
ment at an opportune moment to get the
country to act in open hostility to Eng
land either diplomatically or actively phy
sical.
W r hen a calm-toned Catholic paper like
the Cologne Yolks Zeitung, now the lead
ing organ of the Centrist party in the
west of Germany, denounces England as
conspiring against Germany at the Quir
inal and excitin.! ihe Italian Government
todesort the Dreibund, while the Berlin
Tageblatt, the Berlin Post and other or
gans urge tie immediate ousting of the
British from Egypt, it is evident that Ger
man feeling is ripe for anything against
the English.
'Ihe slory published in to-day's issue of
the Vienna Neve Freie Presse, alleging
that the Russian War Office has ordered
all of tbe regiments in the d strict of
Kieff, Odessa and Charkoff to be at once
put upon a full war-footing, bnd that all
officers on leave of absence and the retir
ing list have been recalled to service, is
utterly discredied here. Nothing is known
in official circles here showing that Russia
is mobilizing troops, and the assertion of
the Neve Freie Presse that the Pope pro
fesses to be aware of "a step toward the
complete mobilization of the Russian force
and portends that Russia will receive
a Kii'opean mandate to occupy Conatanti
nopl " is regarded as too absurd to be
worthy of notice.
The Pesther Lloyd and the Vienna
Pulitische Correspondenz concur in stat
ing that a concert of the powers has been
agreed upon, the probable basis of the
maintenance of the territorial status quo
of Turkey, but upon European control of
ihe Turkish administration. This state
ment concurs with thp advices recently
cabled in ihese dispatches, which were ob
tained from official sourcs.

Maine's Congressman Given
an Ovation in the
South.
Thousands of People Unable to
Crowd Within Reach of
His Voice.
EAST AND WEST HAND IN HAND
Ha Pays a Tribute to California for
Its Fidelity to the Peerless
Blame.
LOB ANGELES, Cal., Oct 17.â Charles
A. Boutelle, the eloquent Congressman
from Maine, was given an ovation by the
Republicans of Southern California in this
city to-nieht. Thousands were turned
away from Hazard's Pavilion, unable to
find standing-room. The champ'on of
protection and prosperity was conducted
to the great pavilion by the uniformed
Americus Club of Pasadena, each member
bearing the National coiors.
Abont 6000 persons heard the Maine
statesman, who was in splendid voice and
delivered one of the ablest and most tell
ing speeches ever heard in Southern Cali
fornia.
The meeting was under the auspices of
the Business Men's Sound Money Club.
John F. Francis, chief executive officer of
the last Fiesta de Los Angeles, was chair
man. The visiting orator went directly
into the issues of the campaign, which he
handled in a masterly manner. He said
in part:
From 1876 to 1892 the Republicans of my
State have been indebted to Californians for
their unswerving fidelity to our peerless
s'ateÂ«mnn, James G. Blameâa debt which we
shall never be able to repay. We don't wish to
pay it In full; we waut to pay by installments.
So i am here to-night ana so my greater col
league, Thomas B. Reed, will here to bring
to yon the greetings of most of the Eastern
BtÂ«"tes of the V uon.
Bat I come not here to call sinners to re
pentance, i come without a doubt in my mind
as t" where California will be found on Novem
ber 3d n--xt, when casting ncr vote for Presi
dent of the United States. I bring to yon from
the gocd old State of Maine â I brinti you from
that mecca of patriotism, Canton, Ohio, and
by Major McKiniey's requestâ the greetings of
the advance ageut of prosperity. Does any
one tell me of a doubt as to California ? The
suggestion of a doubt is an indictment of the
intelligence of the peooie of the Golden State.
The e*use which I advocate is not the cause
of a section, not the cause of a Sta'e, not the
cause of a class, but the ea/.se of the whole
country. When I see men trying to r--enflame
the hatred of the South and to enfiame the
feopU- of the West against the Eastern States
look with confidence to hear of a rebuke
being given to such agitator*; of sectionalism
when the first opportunity offers.
Before a chasm can be opened between the
loving hearts of the men and women of the
East and the patriotic and magnanimous peo
ple of the South and West, human nature will
have to be reconstructed, aad the memories
of Lexington and Bunker Hill will have passed
away.
The question we are considering in this
campaign, it is need. ess to say, is important.
We all know that things are just what they
used to be. The peoole have to remedy it and
they will do it.
It should be enough for the intelligent peo
ple to point to the unexampled prosperity we
enjoyed in 1892. During thirty years this
country was blessed with marvelous prosper
ity under the Republican party. It is impos
sible to find a parallel in history ol the
progress of the country equal to ours from
1861 to 1892. Every day of that period saw
an accumulation in wealth of $2,500,000.
I challenge judgment here to-night on the
policy of our country under the administra
tion of the Republican party. That prosperity
was not ap accident, nor did the Nation stnm
ble upon it It was accomplished by pursuing
a policy which the Republican party gave to
the Government.
There is not a single line in hnman produc
tion to which this benevolent policy does not
apply. We want the greatest co-operative
system ever revealed to mankind dweilincr In
tDe territory known as the United States. The
whole question was before the American peo
ple two years ago and the verdict of the people
was for a reversal of the existing system and
an emphatic vindication of the policy main
tained by the McKinley legislation.
ORATORY AT STOCKTON.
Major Kyle Advocates Protection, and
Attorney Levinsky Equal
Suffrage.
STOCKTON, Cal., Oct. 17.â A laree
crowd filled the big Agricultural Pavilion
to-night to listen to the address of Major
C. W. Kyle and Arthur Levinsky. The
latier gentleman, an attorney of thit city,
was selected by the Jocal Woman's Suf
frage Club to speak in its behalf. As a
compliment to the women who are striv
ing for their rights a number of them were
invited by the Republican County Com
mittee to sit on the platform as vice-presi
dents of the meeting.
Chairman Nelson of the county commit
tee introduced as chairman ot the meet
ing Frank E. Dunlay of this ciiy. In a
brief address he outlined the issues of the
campaign and then introduced Major
Kyle. In his opening remarks the major
said that he congratulated the ladies on
the fact that this would be the last cam
paign in which tbey would have to stand
off and watch the men cast their ballots.
T. c Republican party, he said, had al
ways done the ri ht thing when it found
the right thing to do. For this reason, he
thought, woman suffrage would triumph
in November in California through the
efforts and votes of Republicans.
Major Kyle said that the idea of sound
money was to establish a dollar which
labor might be paid without any chance
of its fluctuating in value.
He pointed out that the history of
Ameiica demonstrated the fact that gold
and silver could never be so regulated
tliEt both metals could go hand in band,
porforming the functions of money with
out varyine in values. Kyle's remarks
were frequently etieered.
Arthur Levinsky's address was an able
effort, and, as there were hundreds of
women in the audience, his speech met
with a rousing reception.
OLD MONTEREY ANSWERS.
#
Ex-Governor Pacheco Speaks to Spanish-
Americans in the Tongue of Their
Mother Country.
MONTEREY. Cal., Oct. 17.-The Re
publicans of Monterey and Pacific Grove
had a big rally here to-night. It was un
der the auspices of the M<*Kmley and Ho
bart clubs of both towns, ana was the
third large rally held here during the
present campaign.
The Monterey brass band paraded the
principal streets, and an enormous crowd
gathered at Bagby's Opera-house, on Al
varado street, Ito listen to the several
prominent speakers billed to give their
views of the issues of the day. \ ;
The hail was artistically decorated with
ferns, vines and cut flower.*, and the effect
was beautiful. The American flag was
festooned across the sra c and pictures of
McKinley and Hobart were surrounded by
those of former Presidents of the â  United
States, with the Stars and Stripes as a
background.
Mexicans and Spaniards of Carmel and
Toro and even as far off as the Corral de
Tieira coun r ry were present to listen to ex-
Governor Romualdo Pacheco, the princi
pal speaker of the evening, express his
views in Spanish on the R publican side
ot the money question.
Vance Turtelot, a prominent attorney of
Monterey, was the hrst speaker. He dis
cussed the issues o" the day in English.
His able remarks, backed by numerous
statistics, w^ re received with great tavor
and evoked general enthusiasm. He con
sumed about a half hour and then pave
way to Governor Pacheco.
Jacob R. Leese, a prominent Republican
of Monterev County, introduced Â»he
speaker of tbe evening in Spanish, speak
ing of the ex-Governor as one of the lead
ina; representatives of tbe old families of
Monterey, and'saying tnat what he would
tell the people could be relied upon, as
they well knew, Pacheco always havinpj
been tbe idol of the Spanish- Americans
of California.
Governor Pacheco opened his speech â
or attempted to do so â amid vociferous
applause. He first spoke in Eng
lish and then in Spanish, telling
bis many hearers that be was one
of tnem, that his parents lived here and
that old Monterey was his home for many
years and, that being tbe case, he. would
address his townspeople, lending his best
efforts to please them and still tell the
truth. After talking to the English
speaking portion of his audience for a
haif-nour he opened his argument in
Spanish.
He said there never was so vital a cam
paign to all of tne States of the Union,
but in an especial degree to California.
He discussed all points of the money Ques
tion and dwelt at length on the issue
of protection. His eulogy of McKin
ley, who, he said, was his per
sonal friend, and whom he knew
to be a man whose heart beat in unison
with thet of the humblest American
laborer, brought forth the greatest demon
stration of the evening. In conclusion he
wished his old-home people a most pros
perous future, which he said would surely
come if McKinley was elected.
JACKSON WOMEN MARCH.
Carry Flambeaux in a Parade of Repub-
licans â Ex- Governor Markham
Delivers a Speech.
JACKSON, Cal., Oct. 17.â The grandest
demonstration of the campaign took place
to-night, the occasion being the reception
tendered to ex-Governor Markham on his
advent in the county after a week ot suc
cessful campaign in Calaveras County.
The ex-Governor was at his be->t, and he
entertained the people with a logical and
convincing address in advocacy of pros
perity, sound money and Republicanism.
Tbe town was decorated and illumin
ated, and bonfires blaz-d on every availa
ble corner. The procession was the largest
that ever formed here and tbe enthusiasm
has never been exceeded on any occasion.
The Ladies' Republican Club turned out,
fifty strong, and enlivened the procession
with their flam beaux and handsome cos
tumea of black, trimmed in the National
colors.
The meeting was called to order by Hon.
John F. Davis, chairman of the County
Central Committee, and B. F. Taylor was
elected president of tbe evening. After
ex-Governor Markham had spoken on the
issues of the campaign Judge Davi< ad
dressed the audience on the free and un
limited coinage of siiver and the position
of the Republican party on the silver
queution. The enormous wigwam erected
for the campaign was packed to the doors.
MINISTERS AT WINTERS.
Pacific Synod of Cumberland Presbyterian
Church in Session â Sunday-
School Convention.
WINTERS, Cal., Oct. 17.â The Pacific
Synod of the Cumberland Presbyterian
Church, which has been in aession here
this week, closed its official labors this
evening. To-morrow ail the local
churches will be filled by the visiting
ministers and on Monday morning they
will depart on a special train.
The synod elected Rev. J. N. Crawford
of Lower Lake moderator. The opening
sermon was delivered by Rev. T. H.
Gerither, the retiring moderator, on
"God's Message and God's Messenger,"
the text being Jonah iii:l-2, and the
synodicai sermon by Rev. W. B. Farr,
D.D., of Washville, Term., on "The De
structive Doctrines of the Cumberland
Presbyterian Church." Text, John iii : 16.
The SundayÂ»school convention met
Wednesday and the Epworth League con
vention on Thursday. The latter eleced
Rev. C. M. Lane of Midileton president
pnd Miss Ella Jones of Visalia secretary.
The report of the league superintendent
showed forty-one societies, 1400 members
and offerings for the year of $500. About
seventy delegates were in attendance.
LOS ANGELES DECISION
City Justices Do 2>ot Hold Over for Tour
tears.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Oct. 17.â Judge
Van Dyke overruled the demurrer of de
fendants in proceedings brought by
Charles O. Morgan and C. 8. Bartholo
mew, fusion nominees for City Justices,
against County Clerk Lewin and the Board
of Supervisors to compel them to place
their names on ballots for the ensuing
election.
It bad been decided not to put the
names of City Justices on the ballots in
accordance with the opinion of District
Attorney Donnell, who thought the
present City Justices bold for four years
under the county government act of 1893.
JudpeVan DyKe filed a long ooinion,
in which he holds that il there were a
doubt in reference to the effects of the
act upon the term of office of City
Justices it should be resolved against tne
extension of the term. He granted the
defendants leave to answer forthwith if
they so desired.
The Jud^re says that the City Justices of
San Francisco are created by a different
provision of t<;e .Code of Civil Procedure
from that in reference to Justices in other
cities of the State. Still the reasoning of
the court in Kahn vs. Satio applies to
other cities as well.
The question whether it would have
been better to have bad terms of city and
township Justices the same is a matter for
the Legislature and not for the courts to
determine. There may be a reason for the
difference, as suggested by the Supreme
Court in Kahn vs. Sutro.
FRESNO CONTR ACTOR BOBBED.
Valuable* Stolen Jrrom Him by a Irio
of X> is reputable*.
FRESNO, Cai., Oct. 17.â James Kervin,

last night whiJe riding with two women of
questionab-e character and a male friend
of theirs. Kervin met the trio in a saloon
and they started for a drive.
"When two miles from town Kervin
thought of his valuables, and reached into
his inside coat pocket to find if they were
there. The draft and money were gone,
and the contractor realized that he had
been robbed. He jumped from the buggy
to the ground, stopped the horse and de
manded the return of is valuables. The
driver started the horse off on a run and
left Kervin standing in the roaa. The
trio were arrested to-day.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 17.â The Re

the line of march.
Out in the VBst pavilion fully 5000 people

Schoonmnker of Sew Jersmy Talks to
Bundredt at Red Bluff.
RED BLUFF, Cal., Oct. 17.â This was a
red-letter night for the Republican party
of Tehama County. It seemed that the
whole community for twenty miles around

3 heir Trail.
SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Oct. 15.â The
paper chase by the Hunt Club to-day
proved even more exciting than that of

in the sport decreasing it grows apace.
The course to-day led over the hills north
of town to a spot on the Short ranch, off
the Olema road, and the "hares" were lull
of cunning ana mischief. The large party
of "hounds" was otteu in sight oi the
crowds in carriages aiid saddles. The
course was full of blinds and detours,
ascending the spurs of the hills and cross
ing deep gulches, whetting public excite
ment to a great pitch. The outcome in
the open was thrilling.
The "hares" were Miss Helena Morrow
and Fran* G.ass. They were not over
taken. Miss Bruce won the lady's prize,
siiver cup, and Sam Boardman the gen
tleman's, cut glass.

SANTA CRUZ'S BIG BALLY.
Boisterous Greeting to the San
Franciscan and the Oakland
Alliance.
SANTA CRUZ, Cal., Oct. 17. -Santa
Cruz saw to-day the greatest local politi
cal demonstration of this campaign, and
heard the greatest. exposition of political
issues. General W. H. L. Barnes, escorted
by the Republican Alliance of Oakland,
110 strong, commanded by E. V. W. Gas
ken, arrived at 6 p. m.
The visitors were escorted from the
depot to the Pacinc Ocean House by the
McKinley-Hobart Club and a crowd
of some 3000 enthusiasts followed.
General Barnes and the Alliance Club
were dined by the McKinley-Hobnrt Club
at the Pacinc Ocean House, and President
Gaibraith of the McKinley-Hobart Club
gave a hearty welcome to the guests. Gen
eral Barnes responded.
At 8 p. m. so dense were the crowds on
Pacific avenue that the band of the Al
liance Club had difficulty in making its
advance to the pavilion. The entire rou'.e
was lined with spectators from Boquel,
Aptos, Boulder Creek and other districts.
Fifteen huncirei men were in the Re
publican parade. The pavilion was packed
to tin doors, and hundreds were turned
away. President Gaibraith in introduc
ing General Barnes paid a nigh tribute to
his unswerving loyalty to the Republican
cause, praised Senator Perkins and
thanked the peerless Oakland Alliance for
its visit to Santa Cruz.
When General Barnes stepped to the
front of the platform he was given an en
jhusiaatic reception. Three cheers were
given for Barnes, followed by three times
three for McKinley and Hobart. Again
and again the general essayed to speak,
only to be received with volumes of cheers
and the waving of banners and flags.
Upon order being restored, the General
plunged at once into the silver question.
He said:
The great itigma which rests upon the
Democratic party of to-day is its policy of re
pudiation, its effort to breed secilonai strife,
its desire to array the classes against the
masses.
Never had this si'.vor question assumed se
rious proportions until the overproduction of
silver in Nevada, and subsequently Stewart
and Jones tanned the flames which are fast
leading the silver Democrats into a Ecorching
fire oi public damnation. These men were the
fathers of the silver agitation, us Alt eld and
Tillman were tne fathers of the anarchistic
brood who seek to dismember tne Republic.
The spenker referred to the fact that at
the time the Biand-Ailiyon bill went into
effect silver was at 112 and in 1890 it bad
depreciated to 95 and the inflow of silver
could not be checked. The Sherman bill
fatheieu a baby in 150.000,000 of dollars,
which the United States was now asked
to feed.
That baby was bred in error and nur
tured in gross ignorance of the commer
cial laws of this country.
Referring to Bryan, General Barnes
quot-d the fact that the Democratic Presi
dential nominee was no business man.
He wasshilty and only four months ago
he tried to obtain a position on the staff
of a New York journal as theatrical critic
and failed. Yet this same failure, this
same Bryan, by his smooth tongue be
guiled the Democrats and Populists into
nominating and indorsing him for the
highest gift in the power of the voters of
this grand Republic to bestow.
The producers of silver are insatiable and
Bryan is but the puppet of the Neva>la silver
producers. Tht Chicago convention was one
in which savagery predominated; it was a
convention bewhukered by Populietie gangs,
stampeded by a wave of socialism and con
quered oy the red rag of those who preached
"Up with the classes and down with the
masses." [P r o lon Ked cheering.]
The Chicago convention desired the degra
dation of the Supreme Court of the United
fciates and the glorification of Altgeldism.
Kansas to-day, after a wave ol Populism, is
only to De compared to Goldsmith's Deserted
Village. The towns and villages are depopu
lated, as if a pestilence had swept whole sec
tions.
Bryan, the blatant Nebraskan grasshopper,
was but preaching anarchy when he desired a
complete financial change of the coinage of
this country. It was but a choice between
Bryan the unknown and McKinley, whose bill
wns known, whose record was clear, the cham
pion of all, the protector of those needing pro
tection, the defamer of none, whom none dic
tated to or cou'd point to anything but pride.
Fellow citizens: I do not believe that an
al: wise Providence, who watched over us in
the storm of war, who guided us in tbe <iays
of peace, who has healed the pang caused
by civil dissension and who nas guided thiÂ«
great Republic Into the van of commercial
nations, will inflict upon us this scourge of

the General reached the climax of hi?
peroration. A vote of thanks was passed
to General Barnes and the Republican
Alliance of Oakland.

Santa Barbara* Suffrage Hally.
SANTA BARBARA, Cal.. Oct. 17.-The
woman's suffrage rally at tne Santa
Barbara opera-house this evening was at
tended by a large audience. Miss Susan
B. Anthony made a telling speech, which
doubtless made many converts, judging
from the applause which her address was
punctuated with. Mi-s Anthony was fol
lowed by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, who
gave mÂ»ny well drawn comparisons be
tween Wyoming and' other States, which
showed that Wyoming peppie were of a
higher average of intelligence and better
governed than those of any other State.
This she attributed to the enfranchisement
of women.

serpentine form to the accompaniment of
fibh-horns, bicycle-bells and whistles.

17. â The freshmen eleven met and de
feated the Oakland High School team
this afternoon on the home grounds, win
â  ning an exciting game by a score of 12toO.
The Oakland boys brought a considerable
contingent with them to urge their men
ion to every effort. The Stanford eleven
was not composed of the regular â¢ fresh
men members throughout. Several were
unable to play on account of injuries;
others had gone to San Francisco to wit
ness the game between tne regular Berke
ley eleven , and the . Reliance. The team

First halfâ The Oakland High School took
the ball for kick-off and made 30 yards, R,
Smith running the bail back. Clemens,
Parker, Rusk and Daly smashed through the
High school Hue for 30 yards. There was no
let-up in the plunging, and the school line
could not stand the constant pounding, and in
. ten minutes Clemens curried the ball over the
line for the first down. Clemens kicked the
goal. Score: 6 â o in faTor of the freshmen.
Again the freshmen kicked off for 30 yards.
Daly downed the ball, and Parker made a 19
--yard end run. Daly hit the line for 6 and a
moment later for 8 more. Parker and Clem
ens each made good gains.
The freshmen got the ball on an offside play.
McCabe and King each made good short runs,
but failed to buck tha lreshmen line for gains,
and lost the ball on downs.
The freshmen made no advance on their first
try, but Daly advanced the ball 6 yards, and
Clemens, made a 4-yard buck and silted
through the line a moment later for 4 more.
Rusk struck for 8 and Clemens for as many
more. Rusk saved the ball, which was lumbied,
and in three more bucks Daly carried the ball
over the line. Clemens kicked the goal.
Score, 12â0.
It was plain to bÂ« seen that the High School
boys were altogether too light for the fresh
men and while they played plnckily they
could offer no resistance to the half and tackle's
o! the locals.
The ball wÂ«nt back to the center
of the field and Chestnut kicked off,
Clemens bringing the ball back 15
yards, Pringle bringing him down. Par
ker made a long buck through the line and \
Daly and Rusk took the ball back to the center j
of the field. Clemens was passed the ball j
and under good interference made a touch
down from the center of the field, bnt it was
not allowed on account of Stanford's offside
play and the ball went to Oakland. McCabe
made a long end run lor 20 yards and Collier
ma<&e four more. The Interference of the
lighter team was excellent. The ball went to
Stanford on downs and Clemens kicked for
35 yards. King and Chestnut each made short
gains. La Batlister showed up well against
his heavy opponents.
On a fake kick Oakland lost 20 yards. Mc-
Cabe made a pretty run for five yards, Chest
nut punted for 15 yards, and Clemens re
turned. Stanford getting the ball Clemens
made a yard and Parker and Daly each five
yards. Rusk made a good gain and Clemens
repeated his usual five yards. Daly made a
gain and the first half ended with the ball
on Oakland's 15-yard line.
Second halfâ Clemens Kicked off for Stanford
freshmen from the center of the field for 40
yards, King running it back 10 yards. Mc-
Cabe made a long end run for 15 yards,
and King was tackled back of the line. Chest
nut punted for 30 yards.
The freshmen tried Daly without gain, and
Parker met with like failure, but on a fake
kick Clemens made a 25-yard end run, Hol
brook interfering in good style.
Daly made two successive plunges for 18
yards, and Clemens made two short gains,
Parker gaining 4 and Clemens 2 yards. In
successive bucks the ball was carried down to
Oakland's 5-yard line, where they took posses
sion of the Digskin and McCabe made another
long end run lor a gain of 15 yards. Oakland
punted into touch, gaining 10 yards.
Parker bucked the line of 5 yards and Daly
for 5 more. Rusk added on his share, and
Clemens, Parker and Daly each took the ball
for progress of several yards, and the game
ended with the ball on Oakland's 10-yard line.
Scoreâ l 2to oin favor of the Stanford fresh
men.
LACROSSE AT STANFORD.
University Athletes Form a Team and
Hegin Practice.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Cal.. Oct
17.â Among the athletes here at present
are several devotees of the game of la
crosse, and although the question of get
ting up a lacrosse team has long oeen
agitated the first actual move was made
to-day. At the call of one of the best
known players the team was started with
a nucleus of five members, and the first
practice took place this morning, six or
eight men showing up. Several others
have signified their intention of trying for
tbe team, and there is no doubt tbat the
necessary dozen men can be obtained. As
it is well known that Berkeley possesses
several good "crosse" men, a match will
be negotiated as soon as the team is organ
ized. Among the best players here are:
Dole '98, Burton '99, and Gregory '99.

SUING AT LOS ANGELES.
Mrs. Fearn Causes a Second
Appearance of Her Husband
in Court.
The Oakland Doctor Cited to Show
Cause Why He Has Not Paid
Alimony.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., Oct 17. â The
divorce suit of Mrs. Lillian L. C. Fearn
against Dr. John R. Fearn of Oakland
came up before Judge chaw here to-day
upon a citation requiring Dr. Fearn to
show cause why be has not paid alimony
ordered by the court pending the deter
mination of the action. Affidavits by
the. defendant and his father, Dr. John
Fearn of Oakland, were fil<'d, in which
they give in detail a denial of Mrs. Fearn's
claim that tbe husband was able to pay
the alimony.
The affidavits set forth that young Dr.
Fearn had no idea that his wife was dis
satisfied with him when she came to Los
Angeles. He had attempted to taKe his
father's drugstore and run it, but it was
not profitable, and he determined to re
move to Tulare County and practice his
profession there. His wife preceded him
thÂ«re and when he reached that county he
found that the plaiutiff and her mother, I
Mrs. Dimmick, bad gone to Los Angeles.
He received a letter from his wife saying
that she would not live with him again
ana later came the divorce suit
The defendant claims that he had not
had and has not now money with which to
pay the alimony, and denies that he has
put any property out of his hands to avoid
obeying the order of the court
After the hearing Judge Shaw took the
case under advisement.
ONE WIFE TOO MANT.
San Irandican Accused of Committing
Higatny.
LOS ANGELEB, Cal., Oct. 17.â James
Priest, a Ban Francisco barber, seems to
be very much mixed in a matrimonial
way. He has apparently committed
bigamy without realizing, perhaps, that
there is a law in this country against a
man marrying the second time while his
nndivorced wife is aiive.
Priest married Miss Rose Dearden in
this city a few days ago without any dis
guise or change of name. In view of this
fact his lawful wife, who has just arrived
from San Francisco, had no trouble in
convincing the authorities that her hus
band bad committed bigamy. Priest,
when found by his San Francisco wife,
acknowledged his second marriage and
consented to live with wife No. 1. No ac
tion has been taken to punish Priesu

ASSESSOR SIEBE
WINS A VICTORY
Supreme Court Decision
Was Handed Down
Yesterday.
He Was Not Amenable Under
the Penal Laws of
the State.
PEREMPTORY WRIT ISSUED.
Final Phase of Proceedings in the
Market-Street Railway A:
sessment Case.
The proceedings instituted by Andrew I
J. Clunie against Assessor Siebe in con- j
nection with the assessment of the Mar- !
ket-street Railway Company's property I
were brought to au end yesterday, when I
the Supreme Court rendered its decision, j
Assessor Siebe appeared in the Superior j
Court May 18 last aud asked the court \
through counsel not to hear or act upon j
the accusation maJe by Clunie. and also ]
asked that the case be dismissed, denying j
tbe jurisdictioa of the court. The court |
denied this and set the matter down for j
hearing on the next day, and on May 19 j
an alternative writ of prohibition was
issued, directing that cause should be
shown why further proceedings upon the
accusation should not De dropped. Tbe
case went up then to the Supreme Court,
v, aich has jus r . decided that a peremptory
writ shall be issued.
The accusation against Assessor Siebe
was tbat he assessed the property of the
Market-street Railway Company for the
iiscal year beginning July 1, 1895, ats3,SÃ3,
--866, while it was actually worth, accord
ing to the allegations made, $17,500,000,
and tbat Siebe, "for the purpose and with
the design of enabling said Market-street
Railway Company to evade taxation for
the fiscal year beginning July 1,1895, upon
fuil cash value of said property, willfully
and knowingly failed and neglected to, and
did not, assess the property of the said
Mar^et-s.reet Railway Company, for the
purpose of taxation for said fiscal year, at
the fuil cash value," etc" The finding of
the court is as follows:
Section 772 of the Penal Code authorizes the
Baperiour Court to entertain an accusation
mode under oath by a private citizen against
an officer within us jurisdiction, caorgitjg him
with having collected illegal fees, or havi-.g
refused or neglected to perform tbe official
duties pertaining to his office ; and, unless the
accusation charges the official with aviolation
of his official duty in respect to one or other
of these particulars, the court has do jurisdic
tion In the matttr.
in the present case the petitioner was not
accused of having neglected or refused to
asses 3 the property oi the Market-street P.ail
â way Company, ior it is alleged in the accusa
tion that hv did assess it, and that such assess
ment was made '"for the purpose oi and with
the design of enabling said Market-street Rail
way Company to evade taxation for the fiscal
year commencing July 1, 1895."
If the assessment was made with such pur
pose it was not a â¢â¢refusal or neglect" to per
form his official duties, but a "willful and
corrupt misconduct in office," for which he
might have been prosecuted by the Orand Jnry
un'ler the provisions oi section 758 of the
Penal Code. If, on the other hand, the assess
ment whs made without any corrupt or illegal
mo:ive, nis act was of a judicial nature for
which he is not amenaole to the penal laws of
the State. It is ordered that a peremptory
writ issue es prayed for.
HER LIFE FOR THE POOR
Another Holy Woman Joins the
Order of the Good
Shepherd.
Impressive S-r vices at the Old Ladies
Horne â The Bishop of California
on Woman's Work.
The chapel of the Old Ladies' Home,
Golden Gate avenue, was yesterday morn
ing the scene of a very infrequent and
solemn service in the Episcopal cburch.
The Bishop of California, assisted by Revs.
E. J. Lion of St. Stephen's church, J. A.
Emery and Henry B. Monges, of the
Church of the Advent, and W. L Kip Jr.
of the Missionof the Good Samaritan, offi
ciated before a congregation composed en
tirely of ladies who are deeply interested
in the Order of the Good Shepoerd, a body
of women who have resiened all earthly
interests to devote their lives to works of
charity and beneficence.
The Order of the Good Shepherd is local
to the coast and now consists of five sis
ters, including Sister Anna of the Maria
Kip Orpianaerc, Sister Alice of the Old
Ladies' Home, Sister Julia, whose life is
devoted to the care of the fallen, Sister
Mery, whose work is eeneral, and Sister
Cora, wno was admitted into full fellow
ship, whose mission is connected with the
Cburch of the Advent.
The ceremonies included the reception
nf Miss Williams as an associate sister
and the advancement of Sister Cora in the
Order of the Good Shepherd. The excel
lent choir of St. Stephen's furnished the
music
The service was eucharfstic entirely,
during which the new associate sister was
received into the order, after taking upon
herselJ the prescribed vows. The sermon
was preached by the Bishop from the
text. "'Let your lijht so shine Defore men
that they may see your good works and
glorify your Fa' her which is in heaven."
The Bishop extolled the work of women
in the church and dwelt upon the his
torical fact that sister oods were coexist
ent with the foundations of Christianity.
Without the help of women the ministry
of the church is incomplete. If the w-orld
is to be converted the help cf women is
necessary. The speaker enlarged upon
tne good work of the Order of the Good
Bhepherd in his diocese and was thankful
that lie had such an adjunct to assist him
in his manifold duties.
The fcermon concluded, the new sifter
approached the altar and was addressed
by the Bishop, who warned her of the
privations and difficulties that she must
encounter in her work, of the ingratitude
and discouragement which would at
times be her lot, and exhorted her to
maintain true courage and to be sure that
the crown of righteousness which had
been promised to the faithful would be
her ultimate reward.
After the address the new sister took
upon herself the vows of the order and
was admitted into full fellowship. The
consecration of the elements followed and
after the benediction the solemn and im
pr'ssive ceremonies were concluded.
The annual meeting of the sisters and
associates of the order was he'd directly
after the services and the old officers were
re-elscted.
The "Black Diamond" Free.
Frank Worth, a colored man known as the
"Black Diamond," was arrested about seven
months ago with two sailors belonging to the
â  Bennintrton on charges 'of criminal assault
upon three young girls. Judge Wallace, a few
days a*o, Instructed* a jury in : his court to
acquit Worth of one of the charges and j-cstei-
Judge Campbell dismissed three other charges
against Dim that have been on the calendar
since Worth's arrest. <>â¢ _.

MUSIC AND MONEY.
Successful Promenade Concert Given at
tbe Mechanics' Pavilion Last
Eveuiug.
Money galore will be poured into the
coffers of the German Hospital â tbe pro
ceeds of the garden promenade concert
given by the ladies of the German benevo
lent societies last evening.
The Mechanics' Pavilion was crowded
by the representative Germans or the City,
who, as is tiieir wont, came out in force to
belp along the work of benevolence.
The hall was gay with the German and
American flags, most tastefully inter
twined with foiiage and strung with
lanterns of various colors, and young
ladies in dainty muslins tripped about
serving beer and ices to tiie crowds seated
at small tables.
The music was unexceptionable,
Schubert's serenade being most enihu
siasticaily received, tbe throng listening
with that attention and appreciation
peculiar to the music-loving German.
It is estimated that over SOOO passed
through the doors and in consequence the
treasurer aud the busy directors werequite
radiant.
Socially the affair bad much the ap
pearanceof a reception. Groups of people
stood chatting about or strolied slowly
aiong by the tree-lined walls. Many sat
ail evening on both sides of tbe stand,
while otners spent tbeir time at the tables
cosily placed beiiind tbe verdant screens.
James D. Pbelan was among the crowd
of promenader?, while other candidates for

MISSION DEFENSE CLUB
The Warm-Belt Residents Want
a Larger Municipal Rep
resentation.
Daniel Webster Kelly Convinces the
Members Tbat They Have Bsea
Nglected
The Mission Defense Club, having
quieted the Noe heirs' ciaim to one-half of
its territory, is now laying claim to a large
representation of the warm- belt citizens
in the municipal Government.
At a meeting last night John Bolger oc
cupied the chair, in the absence of the
president George Welcome kept the rec
ord because Mr. Van Duzer v.as else
where.
Daniel Webster Kelly produced a chart
j of the Mission showing the voting strength
i of tbat section, known on the consolida
: tion charter as the Eleventh ward, where
: there are 9131 legal voters, and yet these
I American citizens are only entitled to
j one solitary Supervisor; whereas, Mr.
, Kelly claims, they should have six, that
I is, in comparison with the number of
i residents in the six first wards of the City.
President Bolger partly satisfied Mr.
i Kelly by informing him tbat when the
I new charter is adopted the people in the
I sun belt will be amply represented in the
j councils of the City's government.
Kelly read from his memorandum-book
| tbe following passage: f
In 1864 the ends of the City were North
j Beach and South Park; the City was buut up
I to about Taylor street, and in going to the
â  Mission, after passing Sixth street, there was
jno settlement until Twelfth street was
/ reached. There were then six boats a day tÂ«
I Oakland and steam-dummy cars ou the Mar
i ket-street Railroad to the Willows every half
j Hour. The Western Addition was a wilder
' ness-, Bush street, the road to Lone Mountain,
! being the only thorough laro.
i There were three steamers a month to New
| York, via PÂ«uama, and no steam commuuica
i tion with China, Japan, Australia or Honolulu.
| The theaters were the Metropolitan and
: Maguire's, and the gardens were the Willows
| ar.d Hayes' ParE. Woodward's Gardens were
not known in those days, and the Goliien Gate
I Park did not even exist on paper. The only
! railroad out of the City was the San Pranci-co
' and San Jose Railroad, which ran but two pas
; senger trains a day.
Presilent Bolger and the members of
the Mission Defense Club appear to be fully
satisfied, and ail agreed to vote for t;.e
j new charter^
SACRED HEART BAZAAR.
Pleasant and Lively Scenes in
the Gough-Street Armory
HalL
Captain Nellie B. Walters Puts Her
Pretty Soldiers Through Fancy
Figures.
The fair for the benefit of the
Sacred Heart Cburch, now being
held in the armory on the corner
of Pago and Gongh streets, loses
none of its interesting features as it
draws to a close. It was opened on the
Ist of Octooer and will not end until next
Tuesday night. Father Flood, J. C. Nea
lon, the manager, and ex-Judge Cooney
have been kept very bu3.v looking after
the details, and they state that from all
appearances the fair will be a financial
success.
Tbat it is a social success there is no
question. Any ons looking in upon the
merry gathering last evening would at
once have passed an affirmative verdict
upon this point. The large armory bail
was packed to the door with old and
I young. It was a merry scene.
On Tuesday evening all articles upon
which tickets have been issued will be
drawn for, and all left over will be sold on
the spot at auction.
The entertainment last evening was
very interesting, and consisted of vocal
and instrumental selections. A very
pleasing feature was an exhibition drill by
the Young Ladies' Drill Corps, under the
leadership of Captain Nellie B. Walters.
The six:een young ladies composing the
corps were put through a number of fancy
figures, which did great credit to their
training. Their uniforms were neat and
striking. The costume consisted of a
black skirt, black jacket, yellow waist,
yellow sasb and black cap trimmed in
yellow. Each lady was armed with a
small saber.
As the fair draws to a close the saber
contest becomes more interesting. The
same may be said of the contest in which
the most popular youug lady will be the
recipient of a beautiful gold watch.
The total vote for the most popular
League of tne Cross Caiiet captain was
4519, of which Captain Jame3 McÃridc re
ceived 1617 and won tne handsome saber.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1896.
BERKELEY WON
BY SNAPPY PLAY
Olympics Defeated in a
Brilliant Football
Match.
Surprising Improvement in Game
and Condition of the Col
lege Men.
LCORE TWFNTY-FOTJR TO EIGHT
Ransome's Great Individual Piaying
a Feature and Hall's Work
Good.
Every partisan of the University of
California that attended the football
match at Central Park yesterday after
noon went away supremely satisfied with
'.he showing made by the Berkeley team.
The tilay of the college men was a surprise
to all, and tbe Olympics were as disap
pointed as they were surprised. Berkeley
CHART OF THE GAME
The opening play is at the top of the diagram. It li Raosome's kickoff for Berkeley from the cen
ter of the field down to Olympic's twenty-yard line, where the ball Is caught and carried back by Har
relson of Olympic to the thlrty-five-yard line before he Is downed. From that point all the succeeding
movements of the ball are exactly indicated, and may be followed by the aid of this explanation of
signs: A wavy line indicates where the bait la kicked: a straight line where it is carried; across
where it Is down with Olympic in possession; a dotted line where it Is fumbled ; a large dot where it is
down with Berkeley Id possession; short parallel lines where the mail with the bail is forced back or
tackled hack of the rush line; a scalloped line at the end of a vttvy line, where the Sail bounds after a
kick; a broken line where it Is moved as a penalty for a foul.
The Initial of the player carrying or puntinx the ball is on tbe line of its progress, and that of the
one making the tackle or downing the ball appears immediately opposite some of the downs where a
notable play occurs. R. stands tor Ransome of Berkeley, Ha, forHarrelson of Olympic, 8. for Stick
ney of Olympic, i. for Pedier of Olympic, W. for Weldon ol Olympic, Sh. for Sherman of Berkeley, H.
for Hall of Berkeley, K. lor Kennedy of Berkeley, Sm. for Smith of Olympic, N. lor Kolan of Olympic
M. for Morse of Olympic, Sy. for Sheehy of Olympic.
won the contest, with the score 24 to 8 at
the end of the game.
The Berkeley team had been practically
run over and whitewashed by Reliance
just two weeks before the first match
game of the season. Then the Stanford
team bad met the O.'ympics in a match
characterized by remarkably even, steady,
though slow piaying, without scoring be
ing done by either side. Those that bad
observed and tried to compare the play oi
the four teams in these first contests con
sidered Olympic and Reliance pretty well
matched, with Olympic perhaps a slight
favorite.
The relative position of the two college
teams did not seem difficult to determine.
Then the Berkeley team, however, after
only two weeks of Butterworth's coaching,
appears again and puts up a snappy,
lively punting game, well calculated to
make amends for what was believed to be
a rush line of generally mediocre material.
It was the rapidity with which the
Berkeley men played, aided always by
their captain's exceptional ability as
a grcund-gainer and punter, that made
them the victors in yesterday's game.
Thty relied upon their trained quickness
in rushing at an improperly guarded
point or in rounding a tackle for an end
run. They made few attempts to assail
the Olympic center men for a gain by a
forcible onslaught.
The Olympics made their game princi
pally by bucuinp the line, which accounts
for their uniformity in distance covered.
On the other hand Berkeley varied the
exhibition occasionally by long runs, some
of wuich were forced by circumstances,
but in none of which Ransoine failed to
take advantage of all that the opportunity
offered. Ransome was the star of the day,
as may be eeen by reference to the dia
gram of the game, which will show that
lie was personally responsible for over
thirty of the Berkeley plays and carried
the ball for a total of about 175 yards in
gains, not including over a dozen punts,
tbree touchdowns and four goals to his
credit.
Next to the Berkeley captain wan Hall in
proviim binuelf a valuable ground gainer.
Sherman, the other Berkeley half and
ex-captain, though he made a number of
gains ana several tackles, was responsible
for several bad fumbles, which trgther
with those mode by Kennedy, the quarter
back, constituted the only very noticeable
i weaknesses in the excellent genera' play
of the college men. With the exception of
little Hopper, the crack end, who starred
in the; game with Keliance, Berkeley un
doubtedly exhibited in i yesterday's j game
the strongest players she has.-" - " :
Olympic, with nominally the same men ]
that played even with ; Stanford ;on the
Saturday before, was 7 not >. apparently so
strong as before. McCormack, the naval
officer, was not on at A end. y - Smith, in try
ing to play tackle and > give up his regular,
position? at guard to a new man, did not
seem to have gained what he attempted,
while Harrelson and Kington again and
again failed of smooth connections in pass
ing the ball back. ; / ;, :: y "
".< On the whole it was a good exhibition of
iOotbail, and { there were ; enoush sudden
surprises and radical changes in the posi
tion of the teams with respect to goal to
keep the spectators keenly alert. \

PANIC ON A STREETCAR.
Collision on Folsom Street
Causes Considerable
Damage.
Scavenger Wagon and an Electric-Car
Clash â Many Passengers Badly
Frightened.
An electric-car accident, in which sev
eral persons narrowly escaped serious in
jury, and which caused considerable
damage to the car and a scavenger wagon,
occurred at the corner of Fourth and Fol
som streets last evening. Car 552 of the
Ellis-street line, on its way to the Soutn
ern Pacific jttailroad depot, Third and
Townsend streets, was running at quite a
rapid rate when the accident occurred.
The car reached Folsom street, and after
â lowing up in ore or to prevent a collision
with a Folsom- street car, which was pass
ing at the time, started across the street.
Gominico Vinuenza, driving a scaven
ger wagon, thinking that all was clear,
also started across Fourth street. Owing
to the fact that the Folsom-street car
Eassed in front of car 552 he failed to see
is danger, and the same excuse can be
offered lor the motorman of the Ellis
street passenger carrier.
In all events, they started together and
in an instant the crash came. The heavy
wagon, which was struck Dy the car,
bumped and smashed over the cobbles.
The front of the ear was badly damaged
and the glass in the windows crashed in
on the passengers. A stampede was the
immediate result an-i men and women
crowded and jammed each other in their
endeavors to escape injury or possibly
death. To add to the excitement the
horses attached to the scavenger wagon
reared and kicked in their fright, but they
were soon quieted.
Finally the tangle was straightened out,
the damaged wagon hauled to the side of
the road and tho battered car, minus its
passengers, who preferred to walk, pro
ceeded to its destination.
HOLD-UP OF A
GROCER PREVENTED
Thrilling Experience of D.
McGuigan 4n the
Mission.
A Stranger With a Bulldog
Revolver Enters His
Barroom.
HE GAZES INTO ITS MUZZLE.
Two Young Mcc, Uns3en by the Rob
br, Make Their Appearance and
He Disappears.
1 . McGuigan, a grocer at Seventeenth
and Sanchez streets, is congratulating
himself upon his escape from what he has
every reason to believe was a deliberate
attempt to rob him and perhaps murder
him.
Thursday night between 10 and 11
o'clock McGuigan was standing behind
his bar, in the rear of the grocery, when a
young man walked through the grocery,
which faces Seventeenth street, and en
tered the barroom. There was no one in
the grocery, and to the stranger there ap
peared to be no one in the barroom except
McGuigan.
Fortunately for McGuigan two young
men were in the barroom, but they were
hidden from the view of any one standing
in front of the bar by several barrels of
liquor.
The stranger put a 50- cent piece on <he
counter and said .-to McGuigan, "Let's
have a drink." He asked for beer and
McGuigan helped himself to whisky.
Just as he reached out bis band to take
the 50-cent piece the stranger presented a
revolver of the bulldog pattern at his head
and remarked, "Don't you touch that on
your life."
McGuigan quickly drew back his hand
and gazed with strange interest first at
the man and then at the revolver in his
tiar.d. The two young men had overheard
tbe conversation and at this moment
stepped from behind the barrels of liquor.
One walked swiftly to one tide of the
stranger ana tbe o'her to his other side.
The stranger did not Jose his nerve.
He took in the situation at a plance, but
did not lower his revolver. McGuigan
by this time had recovered his composure
and said to the stranger: "You area
young man and I am sure you wouldn't
injure a defenseless man. Put down
your revolver and have a drink with me."
The stranger gruffly declined McGui
gan's invitation to have a drink, but
lowered bis revolver and put it in his
pocket. He picked up the 50-cent piece
and was leaving the store when McGuigan
said: "Say, who are you, anyhow?" The
stranger replied, 'I'm a homer," whatever
that means, and strode out of the store.
McGuigan is satisfied tbat the man en
tered his store for the purpose of robbery,
and if it had not been for the two yount;
men being opportunely in the barroom he
would have been held up and probably
murdered.
He says the man was a stranger in (he
neighborhood. lie was beetle-browed, tall
and slim, about 21 yeais of aÂ«e, oi dark
complexion and wore a slight dark
mustache.
McGuigan gave a description of the man
to tne police at the Seventeenth-street
poiice station and a sharp lookout ia being
kept for him.

One of the most successful meetings ol
the campaign in point of comradeship and
loyal sentiment was that held in the
Auditorium last night by the Army and
Navy Republican League of California
under the auspices of the Republican State
Central Committee.
The hall was packed to overfloVing with
grizzled veterans of one of the fiercest,
bravest wars that was ever fought, and the
galleries were filled with the sisters and
daughters of the men who wore the> blue
ani who fought against the prototypes of

General Robert A. Friedrich, Command
er-in-chief, presided over the meeiing.
He began his remarks by congratulating
his hearers upon the fact that the day of
election was near at hand, and the argu
ments were nearly all in. The verdict
would be against lree trade, disaster and
starvation, in favor of law, 01 decency, the
glory of the stars and stripee, the welfare
of the working men and women of Amer
ica, ana against the red flag of anarchy.
The speaker told about an argument he
beard a day or two ago on one of the Oak
land ferry-boats, in which argument the
silver man said: "I've got $1 in my pecket
ana when Bryan pet 3 elected I'll have
$16 instead of fl." The Republican spoke
of the law of supply and demand and the
silver man said: "You just wait until
Bryan gets elected and he'll repeal that
law of supply and demand."
Secretary MasteJlar read a note from
I Judge J. A. Waymire, who was to have
| presided at the meeting. The Judge ex
| plained in his letter that he was obliged to
i attend two meetings in Oakland, and that
i be therefore would not be able to address
the Army and Navy League meeting.
The letter was replete with patriotic ob
servations and was loudly cheered.
W. H. H. Hart was introduced and
drew out a round of applause by the re
mark that labor was king in the United
Staies. Eighty-five ver cent of the sol
diers of the Civil War were taken from the
ranks of the laboring men. These men
should not be defrauded out of the right
ful reward of their labor, and it should be
remembered that under the administra
tion of the Republican party the laboring
man received sound money for his labor,
and the financial system of the Nation
was in a sound and solvent condition.
Mr. Hart charged that the Democratic
party had never lived up to a single prom
ise. If the Democratic party came into
power the tariff would be levied as it is
now, for revenue only, to the great injury
of the working people, whila if the Re
publican party eets into power the tariff
will be levied for protection of home in
dustries.
A striking illustration was given of the
protection policy. One thousand jack
knives made in America at a cost of 07
cents each and sold in tins country at $1.
Thus labor receives ?670, every dollar of
which is retained in circulation among the
tieople.
But if the thousand knives ere made in
Sheffield, England, and sold in this coun
try the money goes back to England to
pay English laborers and mechanics for
competing with the laborers and mechan
ics of the United States.
The speaker lavored fencing in the
United States against the influx of for
eign labor and paupar-labor products.
Ex-United btates District Attorney
Charies A. Garter, the next speaker, re
gretted that he could not address his
hearers as "comrades," but it was the one
grief of his life, that he could not explain
even to bis own boy the reason why he
could not qualify himself for membership
in the Army and Navy League. The
league understood its business and could
always be relied upon to stand up ior the
flag and Republican principle*.
Mr. Garter raised a Jangh and a cheer by
remarking that it did not require a man
to be so supersensitive as to see the limbs
of a fly walking on the ceiling or to hear
the grass grow in order to be able to pre
dict the result of the election on the 3d of
November. He confessed that for a time
he had fallen a victim to Coin Harvey's
book. Ho admired the colossal assurance
with which Coin had turned down college
professors and insurance actuaries with
his blackboards and hydrostatic jar.s.
After t!ie glamour oi Coin's figures had
passed away and the subject was regarded
with the sober second thought, it was ap
parent that what the country needed
more than anything else was the opening
of the mills and not the opening of the
mints.
Bryan was represented as a man who
was going around the country forcing the
people to hear him chatter from the Back
platforms of railway trains.
General E. S. Salomon was introduced as
an ex-soldier of the Civil War, with the
greatest military record of any survivor of
that war. The general was warmly
greeted. He began by saying that for the
lirsttime in a Presidential campaign since
the end of the war sectional lines
were forgotten In the face of the great
crisis now confronting the Nation. This
is the time when every man who loves the
Union should stnnd by the principles of
the American Union, embodied in^tlic
person of William McKinley.
The allegation tnat the silver-mine
owners had employed Bryan as a "spicier"
to advertise their scheme was greeted with
laughter and applause. The action of the
Democracy in dropping the old tariff
issues and raising that of 16 to 1 was
THE SAN FRAKCISCO CALL., SUNDAY, UUTUISISK 18, ISIKS.
known in military parlance as a feint, but
it was a failure.
The general was interrupted at this point
by the entrance of the Plumed Knights
with rife and drums playing "Rally Round
the Flag" and the air roused the veterans
to such a pitch of enthusiasm that they
rose to their feet and cheered again and
again.
Alfred Wilkio sang "The Sword of
Bunker Hill" in that sweet, peaceful and
graceful manner which has given Mr.
WiÃcit his reputation as a tenor.
In introducing Charles M. Shortridge
General Tripdrich spoke of him as the
man who had the courage to hurl back as
slanders the utterances of the foul dema
gogies in ihe East who had insulted Gen
erals Howard, Alger and Sick'es because
they had appealed to the people to stand
by the honor and glory of the flag.
"Mr. Shortridge'a name has become a
household word in this State," continued
General Friedrich, "but perhaps a whole
lot of you don't know him personally, but
if you have arrived at a conclusion as to
how helook3 from the many pictures re
cently published in the newspapers you
will be surprised when yon find that he is
one of the hnndsomest men in town."
Mr. Shortridge remarked that he had
come to praise Bryan, not to bnry him.
The >; interment would be attended toby
the voters on election day. Along with
him will ro Tillmanism and Altpeldism,
sectionalism , and repudiation and \ every
thing else of the kind that goes to defeat
and disgrace the Union. They will be
buried once and for all.
"We thought that we had buried sec
tionalism long aeo,"/ continued the
speaker, "bur Tillman got up in ; Chicago
and said that this was a sectional fight
and that sectionalism would win."
Referring to the fact that the admirers
of Mr. Bryan have been likening aim to
Abraham Lincoln, the speaker said that
the only approach to resemblance between
Mr. Bryan and the martyred President
was the fact that the boy * orator of Ne
braska once lived in a, town of, Nebraska
named Lincoln. Lincoln .never favored
repudiation, and he could not, therefore,
have been like Bryan. He was \iever in
favor of class rising against class, and he
believed in wiping from the : slave the
badge which held him down.
He believed in destroying class distinc
tions and in making all the citizens of
this great Union equal before the law. -
The silver question was taken up by the
Democracy in order to divert the attention
of the people from the issue of the tariff,
which the Democracy could not face,
Bryan is not only not" in favor of protec
tion, but he is afraid to talk about it.
The 8 peaker concluded with a good
word for Congressman Loud,. who had
fought for this country when its safety
was threatened.
At the conclusion of his address a com
rade in the audience proposed three
cheers for . Mr. Sbortridge, which were
given as lustily' as only old soldiers and
sailors know how to give them.
Mrs. George E. Spencer, daughter of a
comrade, recited "Sheridan's Rice" very
spiritedly, to the delight of the veterans,
who gave her an encore. ~ -
Colonel Charles E. Wilson followed with
a brief address in which he said that
greatly to the discomfiture of the Democ
racy the tariff ghost would not down in
this campaign, notwithstanding the cry
of 16 to 1. He told of the times when the
employer took $20 pieces to ; the ' money
brokers, changed it into silver money,
j making a premium on the gold, and Day
ing his workmen in silver. At the same
time merchants were paying for their
goods with gold and receiving silver
money from the people 'or them. ~
: :'i ln â  order to overcome the loss, gold
being at a premium, the merchants
marked up the goods; about 10 or 15 per
cent higher and the working people had
to pay this tax. So, under free coinage,
goods would be marked ' up to meet the
difference between the bullion value of
silver and its fictitious value pieced there
by the Government stamp.
; Judge Henry C. Dibble was introduced
as a brave comrade who had â  left one, oi
his legs on the battle field at Fort Hudson.
Comrade Dibble went bark to the time of
the re-election of Abraham Lincoln. This
restored confidence in the Union, cause.
Something of that kind is needed now.
. One of the greatest crises that the coun
try has ever met is: just "passing and
within the past two years hundreds of
thousands ot laboring men have been seen
marching in industrial armies seeking for
work and' food of which, they had. been
deprived by the operations ,of a Demo
cratic free-trade tariff. Restoration of
confidence can come only with the elec- ;
tion of that champion of protection, Wil
liam McKinley.
The Republican party stands for loyal
ty, for principle. ; c for conservatism, and
preserves what Lincoln -^worked ; for and
what Grant and tne brave soldiers of the
Union fought lor. Throughout the South
on the 3d.'Of November will be seen the
sight of soldiers and citizens voting for
Major McKinley ; as the exponent of the
principle of conservatism.
Against this is a new radical party com
posed of the followers ot Altgeld and such
menâ a new socialistic party which de
clares that the President should not have
power to suppress disorder unless invited
by Altgeld, and which would tear down
the Supreme Court of the United ' States.

form that it would try to establish inter
national bimetallism â¢}; stands . for some
thing, for the Republican party keeps its

COLONEL SHAW'S DEVICE.
It Receives the Approval of the
National Committee.
Major McLaughlln of the Republican
State Central Committeo reports that
Samuel M. Shortridge hae recovered from
his recent severe attack of sickness and
that he will take the stump again for the
Republican party.
Mr. Shortridge will speak in Sutter
Creek, Amador County, on Saturday, Oc
tober 24; in Angels Camp, Calaveras
County, Monday, October 26; in James
town, Tuolumne County, on the afternoon
of Tuesday, October 27, and in the evening
of the same day in Sonora.
The Republican National Committee
has adopted as one of its campaign educa
tional devices in the East a kindergarten
object lesson suggested by Colonel Henry
G. Shaw of Stockton, Cal., and already
employed very effectively by that gentle
man on the stump in this State.
The colonel has received a letter from
Perry S. Heath, chairman of the National
Committee on publication and printing,
complimenting him upon its simplicity
and adaptability. He informs him that
Mam Hanna was very much impressed
with the idea.
Illinois newspapers of a recent date call
the attention of Republican campaign
speakers in that State to its merits, and
i icier to it as one of the simplest but most
striking illustrations of the disastrous
effects to be feared from the independent,
free and unlimited coinage of silver at a
ratio of 16 to 1.
The device consists of two strips of
paper of equal length, each of which is
made by pasting a bit of gold paper to a
bit of silver paper and that again to a
piece of green paper, representing green
backs. The strips are three and three
quarters inches wide by sixteen inches in
length. The gold ana silver pieces are
each six inches in length and the green
piece is four uiches long. They represent
about the amount of money in the coun
tryâin round numbeis $600,000,000 each
of gold and silver ana $400,000,000 in un
covered paper. Each inch stands for
$100,000,000 10 money.
Colonel Shaw hands one strip to the
chairman of a meeting, while he proceeds
to dissect with a pocket pair of scissors
the corresponding strip. After explain
ing now gold, becoming a commodity,
will be driven out of circulation as money,
he clips off the six inches of gold paper.
His next move is to show that under
frpe coinage the silver dollar will be worth
only half its face value, whereupon he
slices three inches off the silver strip. He
follows this up by clipping two inches
from the green Daper, because the green
backs on a silver basis will also lose half
their purchasing power.
The climax is reached when Colonel
Shaw takes from the hands of the chair
man of the meetinz the uncut duplicate
slips and holding both up before the audi
ence contrasts the two.
It is a visual demonstration of the pos
sible sudden shrinkage of the country's
stock of money from f16,0t0,000 to $5,000,
--000, or a contraction of $11,000,000 under
the proposed free-coinage policy. The
effect is very startling, as it conveys to
the average mind in a more striking man
ner than words could the calamitous
consequences of the sudden retirement of
gold lrom circulation. The speaker ex
plains that the mints conld not coin silver
dollars fast euough to rill the vacuum, and
United States Senator Redfield Proctor of Vermont*
[Sketched from life by a "Call" artis'.]
that the only relief from the situation
would be the inflation of our paper cur
rency, and this would only mean a re
vival of all the evils of greenbackism.
Meanwhile the catastrophe would be pre
cipitated in the shape of the most appal
ling commercial and financial panic of
modern times.
The following Is a copy of the letter:
Republican National Committee. )
Chicago Headquarters, Oct. 2, 1896. j
Colonel Htnry 6. Shaw, Stockton, Cal.â Dear
Sir: Mr. Hanna is greatly obliged to you ior
your letter suggesting an effective method of
extvibiting to a popular audience the contrac
tion of the currency which would result from
the free coinage of silver. The idea is a capi
tal one and we will push it along Very truly
yours. Perry a Heath,
Chairman Committee on Publication and
Printing.

WILL SWEEP
THE COUNTRY
What Senator Redfield
Proctor Predicts of Mc-
Kinley's Campaign.
Will Carry bwa Easily and
Get Illinois by at Least
100,000
BANEFUL SILVSE LITERATURE.
The Senator Talks of the R:c?ut
Vermont Fight and the Contest
Eisewhere.
Hon. Redfield Proctor of Vermont,
Secretary of War under President Har
rison, and since then United State.*
Senator from his State, arrived here
yesterday and is at the Palace. Senator
Proctor, since the Vermont election, has
been making a few speeches in other
States.
Now he is here for a brief rest. He
stopped for a few days in Chicago while
en route, and generally cast n : * eye over
the battlefield. The veteran campaigner
does not believe there will be any diffi
culty in carrying the country lor Mc-
Kinley. He does not expect to make any
speeches here, and when he leaves in a
few days ho wi.l return home in easy
stages by way of Oregon and the Northern
Pacific.
This is the fourth visit of the distin
guished gentleman to California. He was
here last just after General Harrison hod
been elected, when the latter wired him
to come on to Indianapolis and see him.
When he did so General Harrison offered
him the portfolio of Secretary of War,
which place was accepted.
Senator Proctor is a tall, well-built man,
with a high forehead, brown hair, a fuii
iron-gray beard and a deep voice, which
of itself would mark him as a man accus
tomed to talk to many people. He is fcÂ£
years old, but does not look it.
When a Call representative visited him
to ask what he could say regarding the
campaign, he said that as for Vermont
that State had already ppoken, and in a
way so decided that it emphasized the
desire for honest money, law and order.
He hoped, he said, that California would
do as well. The Senator told that never be
fore had Vermont given quite 28,000 of a Re
publican majority, not even in war times,
but this year it went 40 per cent better,
and rolled up a majority that, viewed
from the opening of the campaign, ap
peared colossal.
This was the more strange, because for
a year previous silver literature had been
scattered among the farmers. The farmers
were influenced by it, but the Republican
leaders did not know of the existence of
the literature for a good while.
"I hope you will have such a majority
here," said the Senator, "as will leave no
question as to the number of Republicans
here. The majority ought to be big and
emphatic, overwhelming in its force. If
this were an ordinary campaign where
there were simply honest differences about
tne tariff, it would not so much matter,
but to any way make a tacit indorsement
of such a platform as that adopted at
Chicaeo would be something to be de
plored.
"Now, I spent some time in Chicago
on my way out, and while there I gathered
what I could from as reliable sources
as possible in regard to the fight that is
being waged in the States about there.
"lowa is perfectly safe. Nebraska I
don't pretend to know about. We are go
ing to carry all the country north of the
Potomac and Ohio and east of the Missis
sippi. This region alone will elect McKin
ley, but in addition we expect to carry
lowa, and also West Virginia, sure.
"I don't think there is any question
about Minnesota, Michigan or Indiana.
As for Wisconsin, there never was any
doubt about that.
"In Illinois I didn't meet a man who
did not say that the Republicans would
carry that State by at least 100,000. Mr.
Kohisaat, whom everybody knows, says
Illinois will go for McKiniey by 200,000.
And Senator CuJlum, whom I met, said to
me: 'I began early in the campaign say
ing that we would give 50,000, then I raised
it to 75,000. and now my estimate is over
100.000. and I don't put any limn on it.'
"Senator Quay, who is a good judge
and would not, I think, overestimate the
figures, has lately said that McKinley will
got 270 electoral votos."
Senator Proctor had a number of callers
after his arrival. The Senator has risen
steudiiy in prominence since the war,
when he began as a lieutenant. He served
through the war, and in 1867, 1868 and
1888 was a member of the Vermont House
of Representatives. In 1874 and 1875 he
was a State Senator and President pro
tern, of the Senate. A year later he was
elected Lieutenant-Governor. He served
two years and then was elected Governor,
which office he filled also for two years.
Then he was appointed Secretary of War.
Since then he bus been made Senator.

WENTWORTH VINDICATED
Assailed by the "Chronicle" H2
Refutes Every Charge
as Libelous,
Aai Alleges the Reason for the At
tack Is His Refusal to Vcte
for De Young.
George Wentworth, regular Republican
candidate for the Assembly from the
Thirty-seventh Assembly District, makes a
most effective reply to libelous and false
charges against him in the Chronicle yes
terday morning.
He ascribes the authorship of the
charges to a personal enemy named L. H.
Van Schaick and to resentment on the
part of M. H. de Youn^ because he (Went
worth) declined to vote for Mr. de Â£oung
for the United States Senatorship.
With reference to the charge that Mr.
Wentworth dodged 100 votes while a mem
ber of the Legislature the journal of the
Assembly showsÂ»that not one of the eighty
members voted as many as 375 out of the
527 rollcalls, while Mr. Wentworth voted
256 times and was granted leave of absence
on important committee duties during
fifty-one votes.
This should give to his credit 307 votes,
which is above the average for each mem
ber.
Mr. Wentworth was a member of five
committees, of two of which he was
chairman, namely, of the San Fran
cisco delegation and of municipal
corporations. He was a member of
ihe Committees on judiciary, Elections I
and Appoiniments, and hÂ« subsequently
became chairman of the Assembly com- I
mime to investigate the wnstebasket
icamlal. His attendance on theso com
mittees took up a considerable portion of
his time, and he was necessarily absent
from many rollcalls on adjournment, etc.
Hi explains his advocacy of the law to /
protect the eggs of seagulls on the Faral- .
lon Islands, by saying that he had read a
well-written article in the San Francisco
Chronicle recommending such a law as a
sanitary measure, the gulls being very use
ful scavengers.
With reference to the charge of having
voted for Leland Btanford for United
States Senator, it is explained that Mr. |
Stanford was the only Republican candi- j
date to succeed himself, and he received
the entire vote of the Republican Senators
and Assemblymen. -
JSTo fill the vacancy caused by the death
of Senator Hearst Mr. Wentworth voted
for John F. Swift on the day on which
;hat gentleman died in China. The next
day he voted for W. W. Morrow, and
Morrow's name having been withdrawn
he voted for Mr. Felton, Mr. Wentworth
being one of the three from this City who
did not wear the boss' collar.
Out of eighteen Republican Assembly- j
men, there were three who did not sop- j
port Mr. de Yonng, and Wentworth was
one of the three.
He voted for the J. J. Conlan relief bill,
believing that it was a just and merito
rious claim. The bill passed both branches
o. the Leeislature by a large majority,,and
was approved by Markham.
The act was passeu upon by Judge Heb
bard, who sustained its constitutionality.
The claim subsequently passed the last
Legislature and was approved by Governor
Budd.
The Chronicle's chÃrge that Wentworth j
introduced the bill providing for certain i
deputies in the office of the 'Jity and
County Attorney is denounced as being |

shown by the record.
With reference to the charge that Mr.
Wentworth had received a fee of $100 from
Colonel J. D. Stevenson Mr. Wentwortn
explains that he did not receive a ilollar
of fee for h Ist services. He and his asso
ciate, A. P. Vsn Dnzer received $.*K) for
costs, which tney had advanced in the
colonel's case for printing briefs, etc.
Mr. Wentworth showed his sympathy
for the hard-working police of this City
by advocating that they should be given
a fifteen days' 1-^ave of absence every year.
He introduced and succeeded in having
passed the Barry contempt bill. He was
the author of many wise and popular bills,
and was the only man in the Assembly
who stood up in his place and opposed the
coyote bounty act.

PERFECT PHYSICAL
MANHOOD!
Hoi Lost ai_Hoi RepiM!
What is there in all nature that calls
for greater, admiration , than a perfect
specimen of physical manhood? He com-
mands the admiration of nil kinds and
clashes regardless of sex. ;; Why is this thÂ»
case? It is undoubtedly due to the fact
â  that'; there is a' comparative scarcity of
physically perfect men. All men are as
a rule born equal in the matter of physical
! health and strength, yet how unequal in
I these attributes is the standing of many
I compared with their fellow-men before
their life's race is a quarter or a third run.
The cause is a common one â unfortunately
too common. The j affliction responsible
for the shattered and broken-down con*
dition both physically and mentally .of bo
; many men, both young and middle-aged,
jis Nervous Debility. It is either the result
of youthful indiscretions or of living at
the pace that kills. Excessive .indul-
gences, mental worry and anxiety, all
producing a constant strain and drain on
tne nervous system, soon undermine the
! strongest constitution. The -result . is
manifest ia the many physical and men*
j tal wrecks met with every day ; in life.
. Where health and strength,, both mental
and physical, should exist if the body had
been well cared for there is seen instead a;
man afflicted with that most horrible of all
diseases, Nervous Debility, wit n . its train .
of attending evils. : . It is manifested in the
following symptoms: Weakness of body .
and mind, brain dullness, dizziness, loss
of memory, a wandering mind, lack of
energy and confidence, pains in the head
and back, dimness of , vision, | discontent,
despondency, aan -. aversion , to society, )
dread of impending danger, etc. If you

BUSINESS IS NOW
ENJOYING A BOOM
Leather and Fruit Dealers
Surprised by, Big
Orders.
Nothing to Account for It But
Confidence in McKinley's
Election.
MERCHANTS WORKING NIGHTS.
The Return of Good Times to Follow
Republican Success Antici
pates It.
The election of William McKinley is so
far assured in the belief of business men
in the East, that that confidence which id
predicted as certain to follow that much
desired consummation has already set in
in anticipation of it. The fact is business
circles are just now enjoying a thrill of
life, the like of which they have not known
for several years. It has come upon them
as a surprise here within the past two or
three weeks. Without an exception, all
the business men whom The Call yester
day askrd for an explanation of the cheer
ful phenomenon attributed it to the strong
indications of Major McKinley's election
to the Presidency. This applies to all
other than the wheat and flour men, who
have been enjoying somethine of a boom
for many weeks. The exhilaration in that
direction is attributed of course to failures
of crops in other wheat-producing coun
tries.
But branches of trade having nothing to
do with wheat, such as leather and
fruits, have taken on a spurt that the men
engaged in them cannot account for ex
cept in the belief that buyers have become
assured that our National credit is not to
be disturbed by any radical change in our
financial policy.
"No, we won't taKe tbe usual Saturday
half holiday to-day," said a member of the
firm of Porter Bros., dealers in dried fruits,
yesterday afternoon, "we being rushed,
absolutely rushed, with orders from the
East. In my experience I don't remem
ber to have seen business look up in this
fashion in October. It came upon us all
of a sudden, starting about the Brat of this
month. Latterly we have been kept at
work not only all day but at night.
"Growers are getting about twice what
they received for their product last year.
The cause? Well, I can see nothing for
it but that big dealers in the East feel
reasonably safe with regard to the
future â by which I mean that McKinley
will be elected and business will not be
disturbed â and so are going in for it,
losing no time. They have held off and
held off, allowing iheir stocks to run j
down until they really must have the i
goods, and feeling reasonably confident I
that all is well, they liave jumped in all ]
in a bunch and are buying hand over
hand. As I say, I can't explain it at all
on any o;her grounds. Business men
want to do business, and have only been
waiting the cue to start in. Onr firm has
been doing more business within the past
few weeks than it has done in any like
period in several years."
C. E. Whitney of C. E. Whitney <fe Co.,
provision merchants, said: "There is a
very marked improvement in our busi
ness, which has come along during the
past few weetsâ in fact, whether it was a
mere coincidence or not, I cannot ?ay, but :
I remember that tne first notable bunch '
of orders came in on the day following the
nomination of Palmer by the gold Demo
crats at Indianapolis. lam assured that
Eastern business men have become firm
in the belief that McKinley will be elected.
They are there!ore confident that our
National credit will not be disturbed, that
sound money will prevail, and fire so giv
ing their minds to business again. The
improvement is also due in a measure to
tlie upward leaps of wheat which benefits
everythine else in sympathy. I hope for
a continuance of the bettered conditions. !
I have no doubt of it if Major McKinley j
is made President"
Colonel Frank W. Sumner of the Sum
ner Tanning Company was altogether
fixed in the opinion that the better condi- I
tion of the trade in his 'me was due to a |
play of confidence in the election of Me- I
Kinley. There was really nothing else
that could account for the marked im
provement.
"Trade," he said, "has been depressed
fora long, long time; times have been
very bad, very many people quit eating
meat; not so many cattle were killed; the
stock of hides became, run down a"nd
continued so to do until now they have â 
reached quite a low nark, although, mind '
you, *he bottom has been by no means
reached. Thincs a-e in thai, condition,
however, that they ?tand ready to leap I
forward in active business with the assur
ance of security, of protection and sound I
finances. Things have improved very
notably in our line."
A. B. Tairick of A. B. Patrick* Co.,
dealers in hides, etc., talked along the
same lines exactly. "Immediately after
the Chicago convention, when things
looked as though the country was going
to iose its head for Bryan and free silver,"
he said, "business fell absolutely flat. No
man could be induced to buy more than
he needed for one day. Now men buy for
two and three weeks ahead, at prices very
considerably advanced above those pre
vailing at that time. That shows confi
dence in the future, and that confidence
must be based on a belief that McKinley's
election is assured. Tne improvement be
gan about two weeks ago and has been
cumulative as time passes.
"An improvement in business always
grows out of some well-defined conditions
that account for it. There is no precon
certed plan on the part of business men to
buy at one time or sell at another. Busi
ne>s men study their business for their
own individual welfare, and when a man
in Maine begins to order hides and an
other in Minnesota does the same, and so
on from all over the country, it would In
dicate that there was something in the
air. It is the business men who feel these
things first, and who know what they
want. These professional men and poli
ticians theorize and tinker with tariffs
and finances and really know nothing
about either. I predicted that hard times
would follow the election of Cleveland
with his free-trade ideas. I told my men
what would follow, but, I believe, most of
them voted for Cleveland. Well, I am
working just fifty less men than I em
ployed in 1890 and have been compelled to
reduce the wages of those that remain.
"And there's the wool business â 'Oh. we
must have free wool,' they said. Well,
of the spindles that were in action at the
time of the last National election about 25
per cent are Kept gome now in a desultory
way, while those of England are rattling
night and day. England is the one great
purchaser of wool now and as a result she
names the price. American wool-L-rowers
as well as manufacturers have suffered
immeasurably. They cannot sell their
product. We have customers who cannot
pay their bills vet who have immense i
stocks of wool on hand.
"They cannot get advances on them. A I
few years ago to have wool was as good as
having gold. But the leaven of confi
dence in a return to a better order of
things has been working all over this
country, and that affects .the markets of
tbe world. There are no other 70,000,000
of people in the world who are supn con
samers as the people of this country.
When they begin buying they buy heavily.
I expect to see something very like a
boom in this country if McKinley is
elected." ___^_____^___

HOMES ON INSTALLMENTS
A Powerful and Progressive
Organization That Encour
ages Thrift and Economy.
Review cf Attnrs of the Continental
Bui dicg and Loan Asso
ciation.
An association which has for its objects
and purposes the encouragement of thrift
and economy among its members is a
body that is of benefit not alone to its in
dividual members but to the community
at large.
A comment on the review of the work
ings of such a concern will undoubtedly
prove of interest to all those interested in
what may prove a medium through which
their savings can be invested to yield the
largest returns consistent with absolute
safety. The association in question, which
has done more during tbe past decade
than any other concern of its sort to ad
vance the interest of persons in medium
circumstances, or those depending upon
a limited income to buy a home, is the
well-known Continenta-1 Building and
Loan Association of San Francisco.
The Continental Association is becom
ing Detter and more favorably known
every day as a society to encouraee
industry and frugality "and to promote
thrift and < conomy among its members.
It is* a duty incumbent on every parent,
who is not embarrassed by sickness or
family trouble, to make an effort to ouy a
i home, and through this association terms
! can te made suitable to almost any per
son in any walk of life, for the acquire
ment of a home.
An Ideal Home Built by the Continental Building and Loan
Association,
The borrowing of money from a build
ing and loan association for the purpose
of building a home cannot be considered
as going into debt. Without a home a
man is forced in debt for his rent. With
a home tie money he pays out to the as
sociation pays for his property. v
It is the purpose of the Continental
Building and Loan to help
those in medium circumstances or those
depending upon a limited income to ac
quire , such a home or to accumulate
earnings by providing a sort of compul
sory savings system which enables him
to pay in installment* the price of bis
house. How well this mission has been
carried out the following statement of the
affairs of this prosperous association go to
show: â  '.
In the year 1895 the. assets of, this com
pany were valued at $185,400 29. Last
year saw this total increased to $324,522 07.
At the same time the. profit and reserve
funa had sprung from $26,657 26 to $41,
--231 87, and the value of the paid-up stock
from , $31,000 Â«.o $65,000. t A Significant of
prosperity as these, figures are other fig
gures bearing even more directly upon the
business â¢ done afford yet stronger proof.
Thus it is shown that the amount loaned
durine the fiscal year which ended in 1895
was $73,432, while the corresponding
amount for the present year is $141,860.
The appraised : value of , the association's
land and improvements : securing last
year's loans was $168,200;- securing : this
year's loans is ; $358,864. The insurance
covering the association's loans in 1895
was $82,075: in 1896, $158,405. The num
ber of homes built by members of the Con
tinental in 1895 was 54; this year it is 80.

When the operations of any business or
ganization go far toward doubling in a
single: year, and that during a period of
acknowledged dullness and hard times, it

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18. 1896.
DR. NOBLE MADE
STRONG OBJECTION
Insinuated That an Attack
Was Made on R. J.
Trumbull.
Synod Dis'urbed by the Finances
of the San Anselmo
Seminary.
A NEW COILIGE SUGGESTED.
Home and Foreign Missions Took Up
Much of tbe Time of tbe
Synod Yesterday.
The morning's session of the Presby
terian synod began yesterday with devo
tions led by Elder D. E. Collins of Oak
land, after which the report of the
committee on bills and overtures was
read by Rev. Mr. Stevenson. A request
of one overture was that the presbytery of
Santa Barbara, including that of Ventura,
be inaugurated, to hold the first meeting
December 1, 1896.
Rev. Arthur Crosby suggested that it
would be a good thing for tne young
people of the denomination to establish a
college department under Presbyterian in
fluence. At the close of nis speech in
support of this idea he offered the follow
ing:
Resolved, That a board of visitors be ap
pointed by the moderator, composed of an
elder and pastor from each presbytery; that it
shall be their duty to visit the Tamalpais Aca
demy at a stated time ; that they shHll report
to this synod on the advisability ot founding a
college department in cocnection with the
academy.
In making the motion to adopt this
resolution. Dr. Noble said it was impos
sible to do too much in encouragement of
such an act, as young m n at tue univer
sities do not there acquire ihe idea of en
tering the ministry, and it was necessary
that they should have the religious train
ing as a preliminary.
After some discussion indulged in by
President J. W. Parkhill of Occidental
College, Dr. H. C. Mintnn of San Rafael and
Rev. Messrs. Ellis and Reynolds, Dr. Cros
by's resolution was adopted unanimously.
The treasurer's report was adopted as
read.
Dr. Minton, a3 chairman, then read the
report of the committee on foreign mis
sions. The following recommendations
were made: That the work of the Occi
dental Board of Missions and that of the
Chinese and Japanese missions here be
commended; that in view of the impend.
ing crisis and the imperiling of this vast
field of Christian work all be pledged to
use every possible means of ureing the
churches to secure the generous contribu
tions of their members for the support of
such work.
Dr. Thomas Marshall, field secretary of
the board of r reign missions, New York,
made an eloquent discourse on that sub
ject, in which he deprecated the cowardice
or lukewarm spirit which actuated those
ministers who avoided the prejudices of
those members of their congregations who
did not believe in foreign missions. His
sperch was greeted with warm applause.
Mrs. P. D. Browne presided at the read
ing of the report of the Woman's Occi
dental Board. She said the work of foreign
Scene at the Meeting of the Prcsbyteriaa Synod.
missions was merely the letting of light
into tbe benighted heathen souis.
Mrs. D. M. Condit, State secretary, gave
an account of what the boaid has accom
[ plished and stated that in addition to
the education in missions many of the
young i [ eople are now offering themselves
as missionaries. The most of the report
was devoted to an account of the financial
condition and work of the missions in the
various State presbyteries.
The general report of the year's work
was given by Mrs. Kelly. "Womanhood
in the Occidental board," she said, "is on
the rise, and, as Beecher said, when
womanhood goes up it matters not what
happens to armaments and war fleets."
Mies Barrett then gave tfie report of the
committee on special onjects. Her re
port was largely devoted to denomina
tional mission work in China and Japan.
Prior to their entering the synod at 11
o'clock a. m., to make their report, the
ladies were engaged in discussing mission
work. Mrs. F. R. Farrand opened the
session with "greetings." Mrs. E. V.
Bobbins spokeof Monday morning meet
ings at headquarters.
The discussion of "Presbyterian Sug
gestions" was opened by Mrs. R. F. Coyle
and responses were made by the various
Presbyu-rial residents.
The subject of "Literature for the Aux
iliary and Sabbath School" was intro
duced by Miss A. Hambiy. Responses
were made by the Presbyterial secretaries
of literature.
At the afternoon session of the synod,
after the transaction of some unimportant
business and various sub-committee re
ports, Mrs. W. Ptrkins, president of the
woman's executive committee of Home
Missions, read the report of that commit
tee; Mrs. W. S. Bartlett, the synodical
secretary, read her report and Miss Julia
Fra^er, synodica! secretary of the young
people's work, read ier report. All were
encouraging and gave an account of good
work done.
Then came the report of the committee
â  on the San Anselmo Theological Semi
nary, read by Rev. F. R. Farrand, some
provisions of which stirred up a deal of ill
â¢ feeling and caused strong insinuations to
be mai'e pro and con.
Its principal provisions or recommenda
tions were that Professor Kerr should be
employed as tntor in Greek at the semi
nary at a salaiy of $3500 per annum ; that
the attention of congregations should be
called to the advisability of urging young
men to enter the institution ; that various
powers should be given to the faculty;
that tbe board of directors should be in
creased from twenty-four to twenty-six,
and that some one should be employed at
a salary of $2000 a year to undertake the
general management of the institution.
Beyond a slight objection made by Dr.
Dinsmore that the clause relating to the
powers given the faculty were not clear,
interest centered round the proposition of
a manager for the institution. The report
stated that although the institution was
worth $700,000 the finances were now
nearly $14,000 in arrears.
Dr. R. Graham of Chico admitted things
to be in a bad condition, but believed this
to be a bad time to make an aggressive
change in management.
Dr. Noble of San Rafael said he thought
the intent of the clause was to make a di
rect attack on R. J. Trumbull, who as
business manager had done his work effi
ciently. Dr. Dinsmore thought nobody
could consistently be asked to give his
support to an institution in so lamentable
a financial condition.
In reply Dr. Farrand said he would ex
cuse Dr. Noble for the insinuations hÂ«Â» hud
| made against the committee, because it
was due to personal passion and Mr.
Trumbull's being a member of his cnurcb.
He assured the synod that no attack had
been made on anybody, but as six or seven
students had been turned away during
the year owing to financial trouble a
change was necessary.
Judge Thornton wanted to know the au
thority for the statement made about
students, but failed to eet it at the time.
Mr. Truinbull finally rose in his own
behalf and made a lengthy speech. It
was at last decided that ihe matter be
made the second subject for discussion
Monday, home missions coming first.
In the evening there- was a young peo
ple's rally in the main room. The praise
service was led by Rev. H. N. Bevier, j
president of the Young People's Presby
terian association of San Francisco.
Music was rendered by the Moody Insti
tute of Chicago. J. S. Webster "of San
Francisco spoke of "The Prospective Bene
fits of the "1897 Convention; Rev. F. S.
Brush of Alameda spoke on "The Chris
tian Endeavor as a Promoter of Moral |
Force," and Rev. R. B. Taylor of San Ber
nardino addressed the meeting on "The
Christian Endeavor Society in Its Relation I
to Society."
In the iectnre-room there was a popular
meeting at 7:30 of the eiders on "The
Temporalities of the Church," Rev. H. H.
Hamilton of Oakland presiding. Ad
dresses were also made by Elder R. J.
Trumbull of San Rafael and Elder J. D.
Chamberlain of Los Angeles.

Quite English in Costume and
Picturesquely Horsey Was
Society,
WINNERS OF TEE RIBBONS.
The Scope of the Horse Show Will
Be Hereafter Widened to a
County Affair.
Below lofty eucalyptus trees on the one
band and great fir-tree clad hills on the
other lay the polo-field of the Burlisgame
Country Club, crowded with all descrip
tions of coaches, doecarts and other vehi
cles and various breeds of noble horses.
It was the scene of the first open-air horse
ahow of the Burlinjrame Country Club,
and it was quite as English in costume as
Jt was picturesquely horsey.
Well-known and prominent business
men and society leaders entered a hand
some and spirited string of horses. Tne
judges and the ringmasters and many
others of the club were attired ia coach
ing-club style.
The scene, with its flagpole of colors
waving in the lazy breeze, its bright blue
coated band on a knoll, its stylishly
dressed and swell coterie of spectators
arranged on one side on an eminence on
long rows of seats, the strong-lun ed
bugler with his long, silver horn, sum
moning the competitors to their places,
the ring full of prancing steeds, was a
brilliaut one. The bright costumes of
many ladies lent additional grace and
picturesquoness.
It was a fine string of horses that was
entered. That horse that was awarded no
ribbon at all was sufficiently fine, and
those that trotted off wiib the silk pre
miums floating at their temples had man
aped to secure the ribbons through some
superior or fortunate skill of their drivers
or riders. In many ot the classes the
horses were driven by their owners.
All the spectators voted the first horse
show a great success and President J. D.
Grant and otner prominent members of
the club so declared it. "After this," said
President Grant, ' we shall endeavor to
make tbe horse show a broader affair by
giving entrance to the horses of the county
(San Mateo)." All the horses yesterday
were California bred.
The programme began at 10 o'clock in
the morning and was concluded about 5 in
the alternoon. At noon there was an in
termission for a delicious lunch, which
wa3 delightfully served on a veranda of
the club.
In class 12 Henry J. Crocker, after
driving twice through two obstacles, un
necessarily trisd it again. He crashed
into them and lost credits which he might
otherwise have held.
In the polo-pony con'est Texas Sittings,
ridden by H. C. Breeden, was clearly the
most graceful. This contest was quite
close and the judges had to reouesi sev
eral of tne entries to ride a second time
between the poles. The second time
Texas Siftings struck several poles aud
dropped into third place.
In class 21, many spectators thought
, Bob, the brown entry of Charles A. Neave,
was entitled to the blue ribbon instead oi
the white. Bob is a natural jumper, but
tÂ£>e judges thought h â¢ jumped too high.
The blue, red and white ribbons ranked in
the order of their mention. The i'ollo w-

IN FAIRY OPERETTA.
Played 'Rival Queens" at the
California for Helpless
Children.
B? Request the Operetta Will Be
Repeated for the Sam*) Otjact
Next Saturday Afternon.
The little faiiies, goblins, elfins and all
kindsjof tuoonbeamy spirtes that appeared
yesterday afternoon on the stage of the
California Theater earned with their nim
ble neels and sweet voices a generous sum
of money for the Children's Hospital.
They are all of a tender age, these small
mortals personating the fays, not over 14,
and many oi them ten years nearer to
babyhood, but they played their roles with
the precision and the gravity of folks far
their seniors. Long before the curtain
arose on "The Rival Queens'' of fairyland
the theater was filled from orchestra to the
higher gallery seats, for those ninety-six
little people had sung their pretty operetta
before and had done it well.
The piece opened with the beautiful
scene of the fairies' bower where Prince
Leon a mortal having strayed into that
dainty place, lies asleep. Una Fairweaiher
with her sweet voice plays this role and
looks pretty enough to captivate a heart
less susceptible than that of two fairy
queens. Here he is found by Nightshade
(Hazel Thane) a little black -car bed fay
who rules the goblin world. She casts her
magic spell over the sleeping stranger and
proceeds to appropriate him for her own.
While he siumbers the fairies dance
around him in a butterfly baliet. The
Prince awakes and makes love to Queen
Rose and is rebuked for his rash presump
tion.
The next scene is laid in the goblin
cave, where Nightshade rules from tier
fantastic throne. Where all was light and
gleaming with color in the fairy bower,
here it is dark. Several fantastic dances
take place, the most important being the
serpentine, by Ida Maloon, Merle Francis,
Lulu Boreen and Birdie Gage, and the
double siirt by Marie Scbenck and Emma
Meseroie. Presen.'ly Queen Rose is led in
a captive ant is brought before the throne
of her rival, where she plaintively sings
her grief at her mi-fortune. She had been
surprised while wandering around, dis
guised as a beggar mortal, aud being with
ontherown crown and other insignia of
fairy royalty, is powerless. Bhe is bow
ever rescued by hpr page Telfa (Eileeu
McC'urrie), who manages to drag the gob
lins' famous wine. Then Alexina Mitch
ell as Eschscboitzia, queen of the poppies,
goes through a pretty and graceful dance.
In the last scene Nightshade aeain casts
her spell over Prince l>on and binds him
with a vine, from which capiivity h*> is
rescued by Telfa, the faitnfnl factotum
iof Rose. Tiie disguised fairy queen here
| appear? and tells bis fortune and he is
happy to learn that he will meet a queen
at midnight who is to be his wife. Of
course, he meets herseif, as she carefully
intended, much to the dissatisfaction of
Nightshade. In the fairy jollification that
ensues the victress queen doei not forget
to turn her attention, mortal like, to her
defeated rival, and the goblin queen is
banished forever to bereave kingdom with
the injunction to leave all wandering
princes wander unloved.
The libretio was written by Miss Ca
milla E. Lies and the music by Charies H.
McCurrie. The little eirls were instruct
ed in their graceful dances by Miss C.
Gamble. Mips CJara Fisher decorated the
stage and the orchestra was conrposed ot
pupil* of the Kacrci Heart College.
At the close of the entertainment Pro
! lessor McCurrie notified the great audience
i that at the urgent and repeated requests
J of many persons the operetta wonid be re
peateii for the benefit of the Childrens'
j H'Spitai next Saturday afternoon at the
I California. The same popular prices, 25
land 50 cents, reserved seats, woui<l rre
vail. Consequently those who had been
unable to hear thft little children sing in
pretty fairy opera will have an opportun
ity to do so next Saturday.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1896.
CHINESE CONSUL'S
LIFE IN DANGER
An Edict That He Must
Die Issued by the
See Yups.
His Headquarters Under the
Guardianship of a Sturdy
Policeman,
FOUR PRESIDENTS PROSCRIBED
An Order of Restraint on the Consul-
General Issued by Judge
McEenna.
The Chinese Consul-General, Fung
Yung Heng, and King Ow Yang, the Vice-
Consul-General, are now in deadly dan
ger. The See Yups have issued an edict
The Sacred Emblem of the See Yup Company, Guarded by Many
Riflemen, as It Floats in the Breeze Over Their Head
quarters at 820 Clay Street.
that they must die, and yesterday several
friends came to the Consul's quarters, on
Stockton street, between Clay and Sacra
mento, and warned him to be on his guard.
Accordingly a stalwart police officer now
wains up and down the street, eying
closely everybody that enters the Consul's
headquarters and everybody that emerges.
Feeling is at fever .eat, and it is feared
that in spite of the utmost precaution on
the part of the police force an assassina
tion may take place at any moment.
"It is a- mistake," said the Vice-Consul-
General yesterday, "to suppose that the
present trouble lies between the See and
the Sam Yups. That is only a subordi
nate issue now.
'-The real status of the case is that the
troubie exists in the See Yup Company
alone. It is composed of twelve high
binder organizations, six of whom are
now neu tral, while two, the Bo Ong Tong
and the Bo Leong Tong, are at war. The
Bo Ongs are assisted by the Sue Sing
long and the Hip Sing Tong, the Bo
L ongs by the Oa V ick Tong and the Hop
Sing Tong.
''A3 regards the cause, you know as
much as 1 do, but my belief is that the
trouble originated over the elections last
hel'i in the Kons Chow Asylum."
"Do you realize the dancer you are in ?"
"Certainly," said the Vice-Consul-Gen
eral, laughinnly, "but it will do no good
to kill us. New men will take our places
at once. It will simply be a change of
regime."
Owine to the fact that four of the presi
dents of hi. h binder societies in the See
Yup Company have sipned a trsaty of
peace pur9uan t to the order of the Chinese
Minister at Washington, an edict has
been issued that they, too, must die, and
now they are in hiding. The See Yups
are also infuriated over the allesed em
bezzling of lunds left over after lighting
the registration act.
The rooms of the proscribed presidents
were entered a day or two ago, the furni
ture broken and the beds thrown into the
street. One vice-president was caught and
pummeled into insensibility.
An oruer has been issued by Jadue Mc-
Kenna restraining Fung Yung Heng, the
Consul-General, and was served upon him
yesterday. Yesterday morning Reddy,
Campbeil <fe Metson, the See Yup Com
pany's attorneys, filed in the United
Stafas Dstrict Court a bill in equity to
enjoin the Chinese Consul and vice
consul from further entering the rueeting
room of the See Yup corporation at 820
Clay street. After a bond lor $5000 had
been tiled Judge McKenua issued the in
junction.
Both officials were also ordered tc ap
pear in the United States couit October 26
to show cause why the injunction issued
yes erday should not be continued pend
ing litigation.
Meanwhile, the See Yup flag still flaunts
defiance to the breeze over their head
quarters at 320 Clay street, guarded by
many conceal d riflemen.
THE SHOOTING OF HICKS,
Police Believe That He Was
Shot While Sitting at
His Desk.
Witnesses Who Heard His Agonzing
Cries When the Fatal Bullet
Struck Him.
Attorney Joseph A. Mitchell bad a
number of visitors at the City Prison yes
terday and for several hours he was in
cloÂ«e consultation with his attorney, John
F. Mullen. He is still non-communica
tive.
Detective Harry Reynolds was working
on the case again yesterday and secured
the statements of two or three more wit
nesses. JTrom what he has been able to
gather there would appear to be Jittlo
doubt that Hicks received the fatal shot
when seated at his desk. Tne course of
the bullet and the fact that powder marks
were on Hicks' scarf and shirt irresistibly
lead to this conclusion.
Hicks had his revolver in his drawer
close to where he sat at his desk and he
apparently had no time to use it or think
of it before receiving the bullet through
bis heart, but had jumped to his feet and
rushed out of the office after Mitchell,
who fired another shot at him as he
emerged from the door and the third -as
he clutched at his heart and doubled up
with the pain he was suffering just beforo
he threw up his hands and fell forward on
his face dead.
There are several witnesses who heard
Hicks' agonizing cries when the fatal bul
let struck him. A. S. Grant, whose room
adjoins Hicks' room, heard them imme
diately after the first shot was fired; At
torney Humphreys, whose office is not far
from Hicks', heard them and so did
others. Tne cries were so piercing and so
thrilling that these gentlemen say they
can never forget tb.em.
The defense will, it is said, depend a
great deal upon the evidence of Joseph
Silver, who was in Mitchell's room when
Hicks and Mitchell had the fieht in the
former's room about three hours before
the shooting. Silver will confirm Mitchell's
statement that Hicks at that time struck
him in the face with brass knuckles. He
went with Mitchell to a drugstore to get
the wounds on Mitchell's forehead dressed
and accompanied him back to tbe office,
intending to remain with him for fear of
further trouble, but afterward changing
his mind.
Mrs. Hicks was permitted to see the
body of her husband, but not without
being accompanied by Detective Reynolds,
who had a peremptory onler fruin Chief
Crowley upon the undertakers. She
gazed silently upon the remains for a few
minutes and then withdrew. She says she
can easily prove that she was married to
iiicks in this City four years ago, notwith
standing the as:-ertions of Mrs. Gregory,
Hicks' sister, to the contrary.
Met a Peculiar Dettth.
Jacob Spath, foreman of the Dranch sausage
factory of Katz & Co., 1000 Union street, met
with a peculiar 'leath yesterday morning. In
the rear of the store are a lot of steam hen ting
pipes elevated about twelve inches from the
floor. Spath attempted to step over tne od
etruction, when he fell, striking bis head
against a leather belting whic.i was revolving
at a high rate of speed resulting in a iracture
of the flkull, causing instant death. The de
ceased lived at 14 Roach place aud leaves a
wife and two children.

NEWSBOYS ARE SANGUINE
They Will Hold a Mass-Meeting
and Force Their
Fight.
The Little Venders Say They Huva
No Grievances Against the
Morning Newspapers
The fight or strike of the San Francisco
newsboys against the evening papers be
cause the newspapers will not check back
unsold papers goes on with unabated in
terest, and the boys say they will win.
Last night the following newsboys vis
ited The Gall office as a committee to make
a statement of their Bide of the case: Tap
Williams, Robert Wall, George Wood, Eu
gene Dougherty, Edward Wall and W.
Baker. Bauer was spokesman and he
said:
"We enter a positive protest against the
statement in the evening papers that we
prouose to boycott the morning papers.
There is not a word of truth in the state
ment, because the morning papers treat
us ail right. They have but the one City
edition and the grievance could not arise.
"On Monday night we are to have a
trass-meeting at Geary and Grant avenue.
Speeches will be made by young 'Happy'
Dougherty, by 'Fatty' StoKes and others.
"The Journal of "Commerce will come
out as an afternoon paper on and after
Monday, and we believe we will be able to
win our tight with the aid of that and the
Oakland Tribune."
The boys issued the following circular
address yesterday a'ternoon:
TO ADVERTISERS.
When a paper is not in circulation your ad
vertisements are not in circulation. The pub
lic no longer see the thousands upon thous
ands of papers heretofore circulated by the
boys.
The Post, .Bulletin and Report have com
bined together to beat the newsboys out of
their small profits by refusing to check their
papers. We respectfully ask the public not to
patronize these papers until they give the
boys their rights. Help us by not patronizing
the Post, Bulletin or Report. RespeC' fully,
The Newsboys.

adjutant of the Third Regiment, K. G. C. He
Is at present and has been for many years su-

fore it is safe to say that with his long resi-
dence in the City, his sterling character, busi-
ness knowledge and progressive ideas he will,
if elected, be a valuable City official.

DAYLIGHT BURGLARY.
The Residence of Sirs. Edwards, Grove
Street, Broken nto.
Mrs. Edwards, 143 Grove street, reported
to the police yesterday that her residence
had been entered by burglars Friday after
noon and that beveral articles of jewelry
were stolen.
She and two lady lodgers occupy the
bouse, but they were all downtown Fri
day afternoon and when they returned
they found startling evidence ol the fact
that strangers had been there. The bed
clothes in all the bedrooms were on the
floors and the mattresses had been ripped
up in search of plunder. Trunks had also
been broken open and ransacked.
Several valuable pieces of jewelry which
were, kept in a jewel-box were fortunately
overlooked.
Needles were first made in 1545, when
ten was a good day's work.
THE GOVERNOR TO
FREE SILVER MEN
Gathering of Bryan Forces
at the Metropolitan
Temple.
Berkeley and Palo Alto Stu
dents Participate in the
Debate.
GEORGE W. BAKER'S THEORIES.
Thinks That Silver Sentiment Is Not
Dying Outâ Silver-Toned Man
dolin Club.
"Sixteen to One" was the motto In front
of the speaker's stand at Metropolitan
Temple last night, for ihere was a gather
ing of the silver forces, with Governor
Budd as the principal speaker.
The meeting was under the auspices of
the California Silver Campaign Commit
tee, and pro-silver students from Berkeley
and Palo Alto were present to participate
in the proceedings. In honor of the rep
resentatives of the two seats of learning
their colors were artistically displayed â
the cardinal of Stanford on one side of the
auditorium and the blue and gold of the
University of California opposite.
The ball was filled at 7 o'clock, and at 8
there was not even standing room, while
hundreds had to be turned away.
There was a wearisome wait in the first
part of the evening, during which the
students relieved the monotony of the
occasion by giving their college yells.
It was half-past 8 when Governor Budd
arrived. He was greeted with applause
and cheers, while the band played "Hail
to the Chief."
A. B. Morgan culled the meeting to
order and introduced George W. Baker as
the chairman of the evening. Mr. Baker,
looking over the large audience, said that
those w:io thought the silver sentiment
was dying out would be compelled to call
witnesses from some place outside of San
Francisco. He declared that the Repub
lican party was betrayed by the adoption
of the Stl Louis platform,* and dwelt at
some length on the laboring classes and
the 53-cent dollar.
S. P. Elias, Stanford '99, when intro
duced said he had a message to deliver,
which was that at Stanford not all the
students are worshiping the golden calf.
He reported that Bryan is gaining votes
an<l said tar. Butterworth's recent speech
at Palo Alto caused two McKinley men to
join the silver ranks. [Laughter].
He discussed the silver question in an
interesting manner.
H. G. Miller of the University of Cali
fornia '99 said that he appeared as a rep
resentative of the Bryan Club of his uni
versity, bearing a greeting to the Bryan
men of Palo Alto, and gave his views in
favor of the independent coinage of silver
at the ratio of 16 to 1.
The Stanford Bryan Mandolin Club gave
some highly appreciated musical selec
tions.
A. B. Morgan, Stanford '98, proclaimed
himself to be a Republican working for
the elect-on of William J. Bryan. [Ap
plause.] He argued in favor of increasing
the volume of money by the free coinage
ol silver. Mr. Morgan aroused the en
thusiasm of bis hearers to a considerable
extent.
H. E. Church of the Hastings Law Col
lege, University of California, '98, made a
clever speech, replete with witty refer
ences and sharj- sayings. He predicted
the election of William J. Bryan and
praised Eugene V. Debs. He was re
warded by rounds of applause and three
cheers.
A University of California quartet sang
some spirited campaign songs.
Governor Budd was intnduced as "the
principal speaker of the evening," but he
objected to the comp.iment, saying tnat
the young men who had preceded him
had made the best speeches he had heard
in this campaign.
When Governor Budd mentioned the
gold Democrats there was a general hiss
all over the hall, but his Excellency re
buked the sibilant sound by saying that
the members of that gold convention
ought to be classed with animals that
make that kind of noise. [Laughter, fol
lowed by silence.]
Governor Budd declared that it was a
fraud on the people lor these gold Demo
crats to get on the official ballot of this
State under the designation of "National
Democrats." He said there is but one
National Democratic party, and that is
the one that met in convention at Chicago
and nominated William J. Bryan to be
the next President of the United States.
[Applause and cheers.]
He wanted to know who sent those dele
gates to the Democratic gold convention at
Indianapolis, and accepted as quite prob
able the "iigcrestifm of a man in the au
dience that Mark Hnnna paid the freight.
iLant-hter.] He hart never heard of any
primaries being held in California for the
election of thoÂ«e delegates, and no State
convention was held for choosing or ap
pointing them. [Laughter.]
The silver question, the history of de
monetization, tne issuance of bonds and
the proposition to pay such bonds solely
in gold and cognate themes tbtn received
the attention of the Governor. He con
tended that the effort to make all bonds
payable in gold was a plan to benefit the
money-lenders and bondholders of Europe
at the expense of the United States.
Not 1873 but 1893 was designated as the
year in wnich the crime of the century
was perpetrated. Tue Governor referred
to the scheme of the bankers, backed by
the President of the United States (Cleve
land), to bring on a panic in order to se
cure a repeal of the silver laws.
The people were robbed of millions by
failing banks and then Cleveland called a
special session of Congress and made a
demand for the repeal of the silver laws.
Those laws were repealed, but no relief
followed. In ringinc tones Governor FÂ»udd
arraigned President Cleveland's action as
criminal and denounced him in bitter and
unmeasured terms. When he said that
such an act if perpetrated by a poor man
would have been expiated at the end of a
rope the people fairly went wild with ex
citement and demonstrations of approval.
Touching the opposition of the railroad
companies against Mr. Bryan, the speaker
said that opposition could be explained
by the fact that Mr. Bryan when in Con
grpss voted for a law to compel the cor
porations to try their cases in State courts
instead of in the United States courts.
A humorous account was given of the
way in which the last Legislature of Cali
fornia, with but three dissenting votes,
passed a 16 to 1 silver resolution, and now
he found so many favorint: gold.
From time to "time the points made by
Mr. Budd were heartily applauded by the
audience.
The meeting closed with a song by the
Berkeley Glee Club and three cheers for
William J. Bryan.
Svreditli-American Outing.
The Swedish-American Political Club will
hold Its sixth annunl day and moonlight pic
nic in Shell Mound Park to-day. As the club

More Privileges.
The sixteenth annual Btate convention

ing at Association Hall.
Owing to a great accumulation of busi

had been prepared was dispensed with.
One of the chief papers read was that of
Secretary Homer of the German branch
entitled "The Foreign Element in the
Association." He declared the Germans
to be among the most enthusiastic and
intelligent co-workers of the order, and
argued that they ougnt to have more
privileges than they now enjoy.
Rev. Mr. Chapman of Oakland read an
address on the Bible, advocating its study
by all, especially by the young.
D. Edward Collins of Oakland, chair
man of the State committee, said that
hard times had seriously affected the as
sociation, but he saw promising signs for
the immediate future.
An interesting feature of the exercises
was the report of the committee on State
organization. It was presented by Noel
H. Jacks of Oakland.
After the reading of the report the fol
lowing were appointed as the State com

OAKLAND WINS.
Dole and Lamont of This CJty Break
the Record With Hammer Throw
and Pole Vault.
The second annual Stat* pentathlon of
the Young Men's Christian Association
was held at the Presidio grounds yester
day, under the management of Dr. H. L.
Dievr.
The attendance was fairly good, not
withstanding the afternoon was some
what chilly, with a sharp wind from the
ocean.
The entries were good. Oakland con
i tributed seven of its young athletes as
j against eight from the Mason-street build
ing and three from the Mission.
In the heavier sports quite a rivalry
I sprung up between John McNab from the
city of good morals and churches and
Charles E. Dole from this City.
In the 100-yard dash NcNab came in a
winner by a fraction of time, his score be
ing 11 as against Dole llj^. But in
throwing tbÂ« 12-ponnd hammer Dole won
on 92 feet aeainst McNab's9l feet s inches.
Oakland won the two-mile bicycle ract*,
her champion, Hugo Mailer, winning in
7 mm. 46 sec. on an unfavorable track.
He was pitted against E. H. Ward of this
City, who came in second, with Walter
Leitch of Sacramento in the rear. In the
second race with Hugo Muller of Oakland
and E. O. Kragness of this City Muller
made his two miles in 7 mm. 8 sec, thus
winning the $30 prize, with Rode taking
|S as the eecond prize.
Dole succeeded in breaking the previous
record with the 12-pound hammer by
throwing it two feet further.
He also broke the high-jump record 1
inch, last year's record being 5 feet 5
inches. In the pole vault ha also broke
j the record by 4 inches, the highest being
110 feet 2 inches. He went 4 better yester
day by clearing the bar at 10 feet 6 inches.
Lamont of the Mission scored his mile
race ia 5 mm. and 18 sec, 2 seconds better
than any previous record under the pen
tathlon rules.
Notwithstanding this magnificent show
ing for i he San Francisco boys Oakland
carried off the Pfister banner by having
made the three highest scores for its team.
Tne following are tne totals of the
various competitors:
Oaklandâ W. E. Dawson, 305; K. A. Kerr,

CARRIES PASSENGERSNOW
The Va'ley Road Has a Daily
Service Between Fresno
and Stocktcn.
After the Rains S ttle the Dusty
Roadbed Regular Passenger
Trains Will Run.
The manaeers of the San Francisco and
San Joaquin Valley Railway are waiting
now for the first rains of the season before
they establish a regular passenger train
service between Fresno and Stockton.
For the .first time passenger cars were
coupled to the daily freight trains Jast
Friday, but this was done merely as an
accommodation for people living along
the line and for others who take the Val
ley road frei.ht train rather than the
Southern Pacific passenger train.
"ThÂ»- reason why we do not put on a
daily passeneer train now," said Traffic
Manager Moss, "is we do not like to intro
duce passengers to our road while the bed
is still fresh and dusty. To rid â  with any
comfort down the valley it will be neces
sary to allay the dust, which cannot be
done till the rain lalls. The rain will
settle the roadbed and pack the earth and
gravel, and after this is done travel on our
line will be decidedly comfortable, for
then the loose earth will be cemented and
settled for all time.
"We ran a caboose with each freight
train up and down the valley every day.
Then there were repeated applications
from people alone the line to be carried in
the caboose, and we accommodated them
at the rate of three cems a mile, the re
duced figure to which the Southern Pa
cific Company has come throughout ti e
San Jonquin Valley from four and five
cents. Soon the caboose on every train
became crowded to our great surprise, but
as friends of the road insisted on patro
nizine the caboose we concluded to put on
passenger-cars, so that they may have
room and proper accommodations* And
now we are waiting ior the rain before
putting on daily passenger trains.
"Manaper Corcoran of the California
Navigation and Improvement Company
will be in this office next Tuesday to dis
cuss the matter of through tckeis between
points along the road and San Francisco
via his company's boats. I took a trip
over the road a few days a^o and came
home on one of these boats. I arrived at
fttockton from the valley in the evening
and went'aboard tne boat at 6 o'clock, had
a gcod dinner, and feeling tired turned
into bed at 80' clock. The steward brought
me a pitcher of icewater, and I found tne
accommodations like those of a nrst-class
hotel.
"Travelers will like this route, I am
sure, and t?ks it in preference to the tire
some all-rail ride, which costs considerably
more."
At the low rate of 3 cents a mile from
Stockton to Fresno the Valk-y road fare ia
$3 72. Added to this the ."pcund-class fare
on the boatsâ 2s cents â the total from this
Ofty to Fresno is now only $3 97. The
Southern Pac'tic fare from San Francisco
to Fresno is $5 90.

STORMY SCENES IN THE COURT.
While Shadowin? the Society's Office
the Boy's Fa her Is Sgfely
E udtd.
Oakland Office Sax Francisco Call,} .
90S Broadway, Oct. 17. )
A handsome young woman called at the
. oftice of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children last night, and for an
hour and a baif demanded that her beau
tiful little boy be given back to her.
LITTLE FAUNTLEROY ORTH, Whose Mother Declares She
Will Kill Him and Commit Suicide if He Is Not Restored to Her.
When her request was repeatedly denied,
she threatened to take her own life and
that of her child if sbe could find him.
The scene was the sequel to a case
heard before Judse Greene regarding the
disposition of a little boy, who was known
as "Lord Fauntleroy," and who, with his
handsome mother, is a very familiar
figure on the streets of this city. Mrs.
Prescott, secretary of the society ; Attor
ney Bradley, a middle-aged woman. Miss
Dora Orth, the mother of the boy and
curly-headed Fauntleroy appeared before
the Judge, and t^ere was an exciting ses
fcion <X court that lasted but a few mo
ments. When the evidence was heard,
Judge Greene granted the society letters
of guardianship over the child against the
angry protestations of his mother.
It* was clearly shown that the mother
was not a fit person to have charge of her
little boy. Her surroundings are not of
the kind that should be around a mere
child, and her ftiends were not such as
would tend to elevate his character. On
many occasions, at public places of amuse
ment, the boy would attract attention,
which was only too eratilying to his
mother. Even the mother did not ap
urove altogether of the chiid living with
her, an<i tor some time it has been boarded
with a Mrs. Oliver, and was partly under
the care of its father, a man named
Hanks. He has been away for some time,
and when tie returned he "was furious and
threatened ali kinds of dire things when
he learned he had no legal control over it.
He heard that the la I was at tbe office
of tbe society and the place was shadowed,
but the secretary managed to get her ward
to the Sixteenth-street depot in a buggy,
and he is now safe, but not near Oakland.
When the mother learned her child had
gone v. here she could not see it sue acted
like a crazy woman. She went to the so
ciety's office and begged, impiored, prem
ised and threatened by turn-. One of j
these- scenes was enacted which impress j
those unacquainted with tbe facts that a
treat act of* cruelty haa been committed.
"I coaid not help sympathizing with
the young woman's grief," said Mrs.
Prescott. "but there was no alternative.
A woman capable of such love could be
anything ?be wished and could certainly
make a good mother if she so desired.
Sbe threatened to kill both herself and
child if tdey were not permitted to live to
gether. Whether sh*> would do it or not
I do not know, but she certainly has a de
termined character that should not be
voyed with."
"The mother and father and their attor
ney are making desperate efforts to regain
the child, but there is not any chance that
the court will alter its order.
LOOKED LIKE OLD RAGS,
A Child Who Fell Off a Train
Leit for Hours on ths
Street.
Superintendent and Several Men Sud
denly Discharg d From the
Borax Works.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 17.â Mamie
Jackson, the 14-year-old niece of Mrs.
Sutherland, 1727 Buena Vista avenue,
was picked up on the corner of Park street
and Encinal avenue at a late hour last
evening in an unconscious condition. She
bad lain there some time before it was
learned that a human body was in the
bundle that seemed to be old clothes. She
was taken into a drag-store near by and
everything done to revive her. After
nearly an hour's work stfe returned to
consciousness and gave her name. She
wag at once taken home.
Mrs. Sutherland was nearly frantic when
the child was brought in. she said that
together they started to take the 9:30 nar
row-gauge train, but in the crush the
child slipped out of her sight* Thinking
that she would board 'he tram Mrs.
Sutherland pot on and went home. Then
sue thought it strange that Mamie did not
come in.
Mamie could cive no account of herself
from the time she got separated trom her
aunt. She is a healthy child, only occa
sionally suffering from headache. It is
thought that she was either thrown or fell
from the train and struck on her head,
knocking her unconscious. She has fully
recovered to-night.
Superintendent and Tkleu Discharged.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 17.â Tne em
ployes at the borax works at. the West
End were considerably surprised this
morning to rind J. H. Strachan occupying
the position <>f superintendent and a large
number of their fellow-workmen absenr.
Superintendent Heberer, who for sixteen
years had rilled his position through vari
ous changes of ownership, had been dis
charged, with a number of his men, last
night. Mr. Heberer, who resides at 1000
Paru street, on the corner of San Jose ave
nue, left fur San Francisco at an early
hour this morning.
Mr. Stracban, the new superintendent,
has resided in this city only about two
years. He declined to state tbe reason for
tbe change or give the names of any of
the discharged employes. He said : "It is
a very delicate matter and I will not make
any of the discharged men feel badiy by
either giving their names or stating the
reason for their discharge." There is no
intimation that it is for other than legiti
mate business reasons.
Gone With SISOO.
ALAMEDA, Cal., Oct. 17.â The con
stables of Oaidand Township are busily
engaged just at present looking for Mrs.
Louis Schroeder, who formerly lived at
the Terrace baths with her husband. He
was reported to be its owner, but it haa
been learned by a suit in the San Fran
cisco courts that he was not. Howerer,
he did have |lsoo in tbe bank, which has
flown with his wife.
Recently a &uit was brought by the San
Francisco Breweries, Limited, against the
proprietor of the baths for liquors. The
piaintiff secured a judgment, and an at
tachment issued. Then it was discovered
that Schroeder was not the owner. On an
order of examination it leaked out that he
had $1500 in the bank in his wife's name.
The officers and Schroeder both started for
tne I aths, but the husband reached there
tirs-t, and when the officers arrived Mrs.
Sciiroeder and the $1500 had gone, nnd
Mr. Schroeder lookei happy. No amount
of hunting has availed, and now they
threaten to take Schroeder into court to
compel him to reveal her whereabouts.
WHISKY FROM A SPONGE
Two Ci ear-Headed Tramps Play
a New Version of an An
cient Trick.
Obtainrd Some Good Malt Liquor
Without tbe Trouble of Paying
for It.
Oakland Office San Fbawcisco Call,)
908 Broadway, Oct. 17. J
There are two tramps in East Oakland
whose wits entitle them to a far better oc
cupation. A few days a.-o they wandered
along the county road from Hay wards and
when they struck Twenty-third avenue
they were thirsty, even for tramps. The
water of the creek is muddy at this time of
the year and did not appear particularly
inviting to a thirsty tramp on a hot day,
and they waded in itfors^me minutes and
I after replacing their remnants of shoes
they proceeded on their journey around
the earth.
In a back yard they found a demijohn,
which they took along with them. On a
recent occasion circumstances were such
tliat tfiey came into possession of a large
bathing sponge, and this they carried with
them and put to what they considered a
pood use.
They went into a saloon and handing
the demijohn over the counter, asked the
proprietor to fill it with good whisky.
The saloon-keeper obliged ttiem and was
tendered a dollar in return. He at
once refused it as it was de
based. The tramps had no more money
and there being no alternative the saioori
man emptied tht whisky back into the
cask and the tramps left with their demi
john.
A few minutes later the same tramp
went into a vacant Jot and carefully broke
the demijohn. From the pieces they deli
cately lifted out their bath sponge, which
was thoroughly soaked with whisky. Af
ter squeezing it into an old toma o can
and quarreling over the relative sizes of
alternate 'swallows" the tramps marched
on wiser, but not quite so steady.

OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 17.â The Girls'

General Carlos Ezeta.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 17.â The ex-
President of tbe ban Salvador republic,
General Carlos Ezeta, is at the Galindo,
whÂ«Â»re he expects to be able to retire from
public view. By a recent decree of Gui
terez, the present ruler, there is a price on
the general's head if he can be cangbt in
Spanish domains. He says paid assassins
are on his trail who are watching an op
portunity to kill him. He lays all the
blame for the revolution to silver interests,
Wi o combined to get their metal used as
money, and as they were successful the
country is now bankrupt.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1896.
ALL EYES ON THE
"SKULL AND KEYS"
Society Deeply Interested
in the "Frat's" Re
cent Trouble.
They Ask Why the Three Mem
bers Offared Their Res
ignations.
VARIOUS THEORIES ADVANCED.
Sequel to the Existing Difficulty in
the Ranks of the Phi Gamma
Delta.
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 17.â The resig
nation from the Skull and Keys Society
at the State University of three of its lead
ing meiuters, as announced in this morn
ing's issue of The Call, has been tbe chief
topic of conversation to-day in the social
swim on both x sides of the bay. Every
body is wondering why it was that the
three men, Fletcher McNutt ! 97, Dudley
Dean '97 and Lawrence Haven '97 "pulled
out." So infrequent in the history of a
college fraternity is it that a man revokes
bis sacred vows that rise has been given
to all sorts of rumors regarding the pres
ent case.
Half a dozen or more theories have been
advanced, but the most probable reason
for the trio breaking away from the swell
organization seems to be that they did not
agree with the policy of the others in the
matter of choosing new men to fill out
their ranks. One of the resigning mem
bers admitted as much to-day.
Some wanted men ot one kind and oth
ers wished men of anotuer stripe. Some
were liberal in their views, while others
preferred to be pedantly exclusive. The
peal truth of the matter, noweyer, will
probably never be known, as the inviola
ble oaihs taken by cacti initiate into the
mystic order prevent a man of honor from
disclosing the details of their secret trans
actions. That the men have offered their
resignations is significant in the extreme,
and the direct inference to be diawn from
the proceeding is that' there, had been
trouble in the orderand that a resignation
was the speediest and safest panacea for
the existing evil.
That the men were forced out seems
highly improbable, because of the fact
that several members knew nothing of the
resignation;* until they read tne announce
ment in this morning's Call. The resig
nations have not yet been acted upon, and
there seems to be an inclination on the
part of the alumni to patch up the breach
and to bring about a reconciliation, so
that matters can move along in the even
tenor oi their way. A meeting wiil be
held by the order in a very short lime to
take iormal action on the three relinquish
merits.
Tiie "Skull and Keys" having been
founded in Berkeley and being made up
entirely of members oi other irateruities,
more than ordinary interest attaches to
the difficulty which is new at its height.
It is a junior and senior society and every
year new members are added from the
Greek-letter orders. The National frater
nities which now have members in the
active chapter of the "Skuli and Keys"
are the Zsta Psi, Chi Phi, Phi Gamma
Delta. Beta The. a Pi, Si^ma Chi and Delta
Kappa Epsilon.
Both McNutt and Haven are members
of the Chi Phi, while Dean belongs to
Zeta Psi.
It was only a fortnieht ago that the Phi
Gamma Delta representatives on this
coust were in a peck of trouDle. The
Berkeley chapter sought to have the char
ter of the Stanford chapter revoked be
cause of alleged disloyalty. Tiie wave of
excitement in fraternity circles which this
extraordinary proceeding caused had
scarcely rolled by, when the sensation in
the "Skull and Keys" .oliowed in its
wake. Where and how seriously the pres
ent case will terminate is a matter of
supreme speculation.

Public Statement.
OAKLAND, Cal., Oct. 17.â The 1 follow
ing letter has been given to the press for
publication:
Qentlemen: I gave my word of nonor as an
American woman to go at call to an English
man dying in Germany. He had stood by me
and mine, and the man who deserted was not
a man who dared cross swords with honor, for
although the palms of peace came from
America he preierred to ignore them. Those
palms of peace are buried at Bad Nauheim,
Germany, and lie crossed with two words,
God's will, where they who dare ask may see
the spot recorded for Valentine lon Gades'den,
an honest brave man who loved America, and
whose flag North and Soath respect, "Don't
tread on me." I sign my own name with my
willing hand. It is true Valentine lon Gades
den died in the struggle to keep the honor and
name of an American woman and her sons.

Lieutenant Michael J. Meehan, whose
wife and children left him a few months
ago, Â»nd whose experience with a house
keeper ended with the arrest of both for
battery, is now living at San Jose, and he
has written a letter to The Call asking
that he be set right before the world, and

wife and all is now forgiven. He has
withdrawn all he said about his wife and
Mrs. Meeban has taken the two children
to their new home. The lieutenant is a
cripple and can only get around in a

was able to do anything to save himself.
He swore to a warrant charging her with
taking the money, but it could not be
â pressed.

several times the party ran on smokers.
In a room, Bx2o feet, they found nine men

Many of the rooms are without ventila

TRINITY'S NEW WINDOW
It Has Been Placed in Position
by the Contract
ors.
Several Members of the Congregation
Have Donated Bsautiful Win
dows to the Church.
The interior of Trinity Episcopal Church
will shortly present a highly artistic ap
pearance, judging from the effect pro
duced by the handsome stained glass
window placed in the central lancet of the
south transept during the past week.
The window is the gilt ot Sampson L.
Tarns, in memory of his wife, Carolina
Larkin Tarns, who died December 20, 1891.
Elated over the success of this window,
other members of the congregation of
Tnr.ity church have donated beautiful
windows whxh shall be in harmony with
the one just erected. One of the new win
dows wben completed will occupy the
central lancet in the west wall.
The subject selected is taken from the
text, "Behold 1 staud at the door and
knock."
It represents Christ robed in traveler's
gown of rich hue, with staff iu-hand,
knocking at the door, and is designed by
Tbomai C. Butterworth after a celebrated
painting. The figure is given prominence
and brought well to the foreground. It is
very cleverly outlined against a back
ground of trees and expanse of bine sky,
while beneath is shown a balustrade com
posing part of the architecture of the pic
ture proper.
The main portion of the window is sur
rounded by a framework of Gothic archi
tecture, through the niches oi which is
occasionally obtained a glimpse of the
foliage and architeciural construction of
the main picture. The colored canopy of
white and yellow is displayed on a back
ground of the richest ruby below ami con
nected on either side by ornamental
Gothic pillars.
Eniwintd in the base are two orna
mental ribbons, upon which appear \he
name of the donor of this generous giit,
Mrs. Henrietta S. Calef.
The size of the window is sxlÃ feet. Sev
eral months will be occupied in its com
pletion.
Two members of the congregation,
George A. Pope and Walter E. Dean, have
signified their intention of donating two
windows for the chancel ; their orders wili
be executed in Bavaria.
The consecration of the window donated
by Mr. Tarns will not take place until the
arrival of Bishop Nichols.

FOUR THOUSAND VOICES,
A. M. Benham Wi;i Direct the
Music of the Great C E.
Convention.
The Preliminary Arrangements for
the Heavy Task W;ll B2 Made
at Once.
Oakland Office San Fkancisco Call,)
&03 Broad wav, Oct. 17. )
The "committee of '97" having in charge
the arrangements for the great gathering
of Christian Eudeavorers in San Francisco
next year haa unanimously decided upon
A. M. Benham of this city as musical
A. M. Benham, the Veteran Choif
Leader, Who Will Organize a
Choir of 4000 Voices.
director and conductor of the International
C. E. convention. The sessions will be
held in San Francisco from July 7 to 13.
There were several names placed before
the committee, but Mr. Benharn was the
unanimous choice. His work will be to
train an j get together a choir of not less
than 4000 voices, which will be selected
from all around the bay. He will also be
required to lead the singing of- the vast
audiences that will sometimes numoer
more than 10,000 voices.
Although next Jaiy seems a long way
off Mr. Benham will have to get to work
at once as the task is an immense one.
No such choir as he in commissioned to
organ;ze and train has ever been seen on
this side of Chicago and it will be draited
from every church where there is a Chris
tian Endeavor society. As it will be im
possible to hold many general rehearsals
with such an immense number of choris
ters, tne music will have to be selected at
once and supplied to every society for
practice, and Mr. Benham will have to ap
point a large corps of assistants to aid
him, so that when all come together there
will be perfect harmony.
Mr. Benham is one of the best-known
men engaged in church work in Califor
nia. For tne past seventeen years he has
been director of the large chorus choir of
the First Congregational Church. For
nineteen years previous to his coniini; to
this city lie was a choir-leader in ttie Kast,
and was director of the Minneapolis Musi
cal Union. For many years he has done
no outside work, and many choristers and
choir-leaders in the East wili be surprised
to hear that the veteran director is still in
business and will meet tbeni next July.

TO COMPETE TO
CENTRAL AMERICA
A Line of Steam Schooners
to Run From San
Diego.
They Will Carry Passengers and
Freight and Will Call at
This Port
IXTKA BOATS BEING BUILT.
Captain Dan Haskell Does His First
Work as a Full-Fledged
Pilot.
Another opposition steamer line has
been put on the Central American route.
On this occasion there will be no attempt
to secure New York freight, but every
thing in sight from Panama to San Fran
cisco will be sought for and cut r ttes will
be the result. San D.ego will be the prin
cipal port of entry and the trade of San
bleEO and Los Angeles counties will be
:atered to. This means that San Diego
md Los Angeles are in a combination to
lake away the Central American trade
from San Francisco, and while the Pa
:itic Mail will suffer the merchants of this
City will have to row in the same boat.
A couple of years ago the steamers of
the Pacific Mail used to stop at San Diego
>n their way to San Francisco. Finally
Beneral Manager Schwerin found the
Â»xlra delay was more than the company
:ould stand and ever since the steamers
have been coming direct to San Francisco,
Wfien the decision was reached the mer
chants of the southern county got angry,
md ever since they have been attempting
lo inaugurate a separate line. Finally
'.hey got J. S. Kimball & Co. interested,
md that firm has decided to put several of
[ts steam schooners on the route. The
Protection is now loading at Mission-street
tvharf, and early this week will sail for
Panama and way ports. At San Diego she
frill take on considerable carjro, and here
if ter that port will be her headquarters.
It is the intention of the promoters of
(he scheme to run three steam schooners
tegularly, and in the meantime three
thoroughly equipped vessels of ihe same
ilasa are beiug built for tne trade. They
frill have first-class accommodations and
frill be able to stop at all the small ports
in tbe Pacific Coast, thus rendering a
treat help to shippers. The Protection is
loading at Mission-street wharf, ami more
largo is offering than the vessel can carry.
Tommy Crowlev and William Clark,
[he boatmen, had a race around Goat
Island yesterday. It was for a "chip-in"
dinner and Crowley won. Clark bad to
â¢'chip in" to the extent of $2 50 when the
race was over and ihe repast had been
partaken of.
Captain Dan Haskell did Ms first job as
1 pilot yesterday. He brought in the
British tramp steamer Flintshire from
lea and took out the British ship East
iroft. He made a splendid showing in
Â»oth instances thus proving he is equally |
âºood as a towboat man or pilot. The |
Flintshire is one of the finest class of
''tramp- 1 ' that has ever come to San Fran
tisco. This is her maiden voyage and the
thances are that Captain Dwyer will suc
:eed in stowing away nearly 6000 tons of
vheat in her hold. The Flintshire was
ouilt by the Sunderland Shipbuilding |
Company (Limited) and is 364 feet long, 45
feet 2 inches wide and 27 feet 7 inches
lee p.
Her tonnage is 3800 tons cross. She i
.oads wheat at Â£1 6s 3d for G. W. McNear, I
md will receive quick dispatch. Her
charter party calls for St. Vincent for
Â»rders, but tne chances are that she will
{o to Calcutta direct.
The steam whaler William Baylies got
n from the Okhotsk Sea yesterday and
â¢cent direct to Oakland Creek. She "came
In light, not even a whale having been
lighted. An icefloe was run into off the
toast of Japan, and the vessel began to
leak. Captain Mclnnis wanted to pro
ceed to the Arctic, but the men refused.
Consequently the Baylies was headed for
fean Francisco, arriving yesterday. The
fnen who shipped on "a lay" will be paid
Â»ff with $1, but the officers will receive
fbeir small salary and nothing more.
The whaleback C.ty of Everett is in
trouble. After laying up at Sausalito for
I month she was again placed in uomrais
iion, and a few days ago started for Puget
Bound. While entering Departure Bay
ihe ran on a rock. Alter a couple of at
tempts she was got off, and steamed into
Vancouver, B. C. There she wiil be re
paired, and if all goes well will bring a j
largo of coal to San Francisco.
G F. smith <fe Co. received a cable yes
ierday stating that the old bark Sonoma
(vas ashore on the coast of Japan. The
Vessel is an old-timer and well known
here. Her owners are not at all anxious
jver the matter, however, and say that the
Sonoma tv ill be got off and make a quick
run to this port. She is one of the best
known vessels in the coasting trade and is
i thoroughly sound boat, so that it would
lake a great d >al of battering on any coast
lo make her unseaworthy.
The schooner Falcon got in from Bering
6ea yesterday. The captain reports a ligDt
batch and "bad weather and a thick fog"
luring almost the entire season. The Ber
ng Sea catch was 340 skins and tit* catch
ior the entire season was 1703 skins. Men
Interested m the fleet are very much down
In the month and times will be very hard
for the hunters and sailors who went out
an the schooners this winter.

BOB FITZSIMMONS
AND TOM SHARKEY
The Elongated New Zea
lander Is Emulating
Professor Jim.
He Wants His Own Referee
and a Palace Car to
This City.
THE SAILOR IS DISGUSTED.
Groom of the National Club Offarei
Fitz a $10,000 Purse and
$500 Expenses.
Manager Groom of the National Ath
letic Club has been privately negotiating
with Martin Julian for some days past
with the object of consummating a match
between Tom Sharkey and Bob Fitzsim
mons.
Groom has given up all idea of getting
"Professor" James J. Corbett, as the latest
intelligence from the East is to the effect
that Corbett bas quit the ring and in
future will give his entire attention to the
stage.
According to interviews which the New
York reporters had with Fitzsimmons
since his arrival from old England, Man
ager Groom expected that the elongated
New Zealand prize-fighter would jump at
the first good offer that was made to him
for a fistic argument with Sailor Tom, but
according to the latest dispatches from
his manager it now looks as if Fitzsim
mons is not particularly anxious to meet
the husky lad who drove terror into Cor
bett's heart.
"Yes, l thought that the better policy
in view of the unlimited amount of news
paper notoriety which Corbett and Shar
key recently received," said Manager
Groom, "was to keep a silent tongue con
cerning the Fitzsimmons and Sbarkey af
fair until the match was consummated.
But vow that Fitzsimmons ia placing
stumbling-blocks in the way of a fight I
might just as well give you the purport of
our correspondence.
"Last Wednesday I wired Fitzsimmons
that the National Club would give $10,000
for a ten- round contest between him and
Sharkey, and on the day following I re
ceived this answer from Martin Julian,
who is manager for the fighter:
New York, N. V., Oct 15.
Will match Fitzsimmons against Sharkey on
following conditions: Purse to be $10,000 and
winner to take all and $1000 for our train
ing and traveling expenses; club to de
posit $5000 as forfeit on signing articles;
balance put up ten days before match; Queens
berry rules to govern and either Siler or House
man oi Chicago to referee the mated, wiiich
must take place before December 1, on ac
count of our Corbett match. Answer.
Martin julian.
Manager for Fitzsimmons.
"I immediately answered the message,"
continued Groom, "and stated that the
National Club would allow $500 for travel
ing expenses (which I consider a very fair
offer)', and if acceptable I would deposit
$5000 as per Julian's request. So far as
Sharkey is concerned, he agreed to every
thing excepting the selection of the
referees named by Julian. His manager,
Lynch, stated that just as soon as Fitz
simmons or his manager reached this City
a referee could be selected, if Julian really
intended business.
"Now you can see for yourself the
schemes that are being concocted by those
champion hippodromers to avoid a meet
ing with the sailor. This is what Julian
telegraphs me in answer:
Nothing less than $1000 for expenses, which
amount must not be deducted from the purse.
Referee must be chosen before we leave New
York. What's the matter with Siler or House
man? Both straight fellow*. Can't you ar
range for a fight iiuring week ol December 7?
If satisfactory forward expense money imme
diately and we will start for Frisco.
Martin Julian.
"I answered this telegram by etating
that the club would not exceed $500 for
expenses and that Sharkey would not
agree to the selection of a referee until the
managers of the pugilists met in this City,
where the right is to take place, ana that
everything else was satisfactory. Just a
moment ago I received Julian's reply,
which reads:
We want $1000 expenses, but referee must
be agreed upon belore we leave here. Let
Sharkey suggest some names. Can't you ar
range fiKh., for December 8 or 9? Julian.
"Now you can see that Julian is looking
for the best of everything. He wants his
own referee, and the idea of $1000 expenses
is certainly ridiculous. The old Califor
nia Club when it was in its prime would
be amused if Fitzsimraons demanded
$1000 expenses from New York to tuls
City. Why, the prominent athletic clubs
of London, England, would not dream of
allowing a pugilist $1000 expenses from
New York to England, and here is
Mr. Julian demandini; that sum from
the National Club. Does it not look,
on tbe face of it, that Fiizsimmons is
adopting the tactics employed by Cofbett
to avoid a clash with the powerful sailor?
His trainer. Stelzner, is here and I am
| sure tuftt $500 will furnish Fitzsimmons
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1896.
and Julian first-class accommodations
from New York to this City. Neither
S.'iarkey nor his trainer knows ei' her of the
men whom Julian bas suggested to act as
referee, and 1 should judge that there are
among the sporting people of tnis City
some man who would mete out justice to
the contestants and permit only a fair
field and no favor. If they were to tight
under the auspices of the London Sporting
ClnbMr. Julian would not dream of sug
gestin a referee, because the club makes
that selection without consulting the
fighters."

ney, unknown; W.L. Hopkins, accident; John
Armstrong, accident; Hattie Jenkins, abor
tion, self-committed; Nellie Deady, accident;

of the San Francisco Bureau of Foreign Com
merce, sailed on the B lgic for Japan yester
day. The bureau includes all of the leading

pose is to build up a more extensive trade
with tbe Oriental countries. Mr. Townsend
will attend to this mission, and after next
month the bureau will extend its operations
by sending representatives to Central and
Soutn America, Australia and Africa.
Judge Fehral won the good opinion of
all, irrespective of party, while on the
bench, and there can be no doubt of his
election. He is the right man in the
right place as Superior Judge.
WHEAT STILL
CLIMBING UPWARD
The Farmers Who Havn't
Sold May Get on Vel
vet This Year.
And Those Who Have May
Get There Next
Year.
GOOD EFFECT LIKELY TO LAST.
India Bought and That Cansed Itâ A .l
Grains Advancing in Sym
pathy.
The scene at the Produce Exchange all
day yesterday was calculated to cheer the
grain-grower to a new and very lively in
terest in life. The dealer in grain gave
every indication of being already cheered.
Great excitement prevailed from the
opening to the close as prices steadily ad
vanced.
The advance during the day was the
long jump of 10 cent per cental. That for
the preceding day was 8 cents. The ad
vance for the week was 25 cents.
It was said that dealers really did not
know what wheat was worth yesterday,
so rapidly did one report follow another.
And this was calculated, if they proved
true, to materially affect the price for the
season.
The most inspiring condition, and which
has proved true, is that India has ordered
wheat â India, the great grower and ex
porter. This is the first instance in the
history of the wheat market where wheat
has teen shipped to India. It bas always
been a big exporter, always a menace to
the American market. The latest advices
are that unless they get rain the entire
Indian crop will be lost, in which case of
course the demand from this country will
be very large, and the effect will be felt
through more than one s< ason.
The advance in wheat has been steady
through six weeks or two months, and be
ean with reports of shortage in Southern
Russia. When the news of losses and
threatened losses in India followed it set
tbe market on edge. The market here
acted taster than elsewhere under these
advices from the fact that California or
the Pacific Coast is in position to furnish
wheat more quickly than any other â it is
the nearest market.
Reports came also of a widespread
drought in Australia, which drew upon
this market last year to some extent.
This report added another to prices, but
since then there has been rain and assur
ances of good condition there.
Two months ago spot No. 1 wheat, Port
Costa delivery, sold at 97^. Yesterday
the price stood at $1 40 '.o $1 42&
Flour, under the same influences, has
advanced $1 within three weeks.
Barley, oats, corn, rye, buckwheat, mill
stuffs, hay, feed, and even beans and seeds
have made steady advances in sympathy
with wheat.

PLEDGE-DODGERS
NOT YET REBUKED
The Democratic Legislative
Nominees Are Treated
Leniently.
No Action Has Been Taken by
the Non-Partisan Campaign
Committee.
BAD AS BUCKLEY'S NOMINEES.
At Any Rate Those Discredited Indi
viduals Cou d Have Done No
Worse.
Greatly to the surprise of the general
public no steps have yet been taken by the
Non-Partisan campaign committee to re
pudiate or even rebuke the Democratic
legislative nominees who have tried to
back out of their pledge to support the
new charter in the event of their election.
The pledge that was taken by Samuel
Braunhart, Hugo K. Asher. Eugene F.
Lacy, John Allen, Eugene J. Hannon,
James P. Brady, John Power, George B.
Godfrey and William N. Gately was clear
cut and specific to the highest degree, and
there can be no pretense on the part of
those persons that they did not clearly
understand its import. Here are the
words:
I hereby promise that if I am elected
to the Legislature I will, by my vote
and Influence, endeavor to secure the
adoption of the new charter in its en
tirety, without amendment by the
Legislature.
There was nothing uncertain or in
volved in that pledge, and when it was
signed and the pledge was accepted by the
Non-Partisans there can be no doubt that
the Democratic legislative nominees thor
oughly comprehended it. At that time they
madenot the slightest objection to its
binding provisions, and it seems that the
wishes of their constituents were at that
moment not considered of so much im
portance as the indorsement of the Non-
Partisans, which the nominees at once
secured.
That indorsement being obtained, and
the last day on which chances in the offi
cial ballot may be made having passed,
Mr. Braunhart and his associates all at
once awakened to a realizing sense of the
importance of their constituents' wishes.
This second position might have been con
strued as a creditable act if it had been
taken before the Non-Partisans granted
their indorsement, for which all the Demo
cratic nominees were striving. In view of
the outcome and tbe unfortunate circum
stances of the case it smacks of that ugly
proceedine commonly known as obtain
ing a valuable thing under false pre
tenses.
No effort is made to explain this remark
able dodging of a promise on tbe part of
Braunhart, Asher and their companions
except in the statement that the pledge
was inadvisedly taken, and should be
modified to the extent that Assemblymen
and Senators, as to their votes in the Leg
islature, should be guided entirely by the
vote of their constituents on the charter
in their respective Senatorial and Assem
bly districts.
Among the members of the Non-
Partisan party the feeling of disgust
over the situation is growing, and
there can be no doubt that if the
time for removin? names from the official
ballot had not passed those names would
go off in a hurry. As the Non-Partisans
cannot get the names off in a legal way
they can do the next best thing by voting
against them; and this course a great ma
jority of them will undoubtedly pursue.
"We were very careful not to put any
Buckley nominees on our ticket," said a
member of the Non-Partisan party yes
terday. "We took that precaution for
the reason that we had been warned to
look out for treachery if we had any

SaVed tKe Life
of a Miner
About the time that the scientific world has made up its
mind that the cathode or Roentgen ray has reached the limit
of its usefulness some new phase is sure to present itself and
disclose new phenomena, so that it is impossible to even guess
what will be the end of the applications of the mysterious green
light. The latest piece of work that is a departure from the
ordinary is enough to show that a laboratory is not necessary to
get the best results, and that it is possiDle to transport the
costly apparatus into almost inaccessible places to make exam
inations of injured people. The work in question was done by
Ralph L. Van der Naillen of this City about ten days ago, at
which time he took one of the largest outfits on the coast from
Ban Francisco into the depths of the Golden Gate mine, that is
located about two miles from Sonora, Tuolumne County.
"I had never thought of doing such a piece of work," said
Mr. Van der Naillen, when telling of his trip. "I had used the
X-ray apparatus in my own laboratory, and on one or two. occa
sio is transported it to some of the halls in the City for exhi
bition purposes. Even that was a difficult undertaking an i
somewhat dangerous lor the apparatus, so that when I was asked
to go to the Golden Gate mine by Mr. Fisher, one of the owners,
I did not look upon it with any great favor.
"The only thing that made me go was the knowledge that
the man I was asked to examine might die if I did not Mr.
Fisher explained to me on a Tuesday evening that Joseph
Francis, the assistant superintendent in the mine, had been
severely injured that morning by being caught in the hoisting
machinery. It seems that Francis was at work near the big
winding drum when in some unexplainable manner his jumper
was caught under one of the ropes. He was lifted off his feet
and twirled around several times, being bumped against the
wall of the mine with each revolution. When at last the
machinery was stopped he was dragged out insensible. Dr-
Bromley found a couple of broken bones in the right arm and
several bruises in other parts of tie body. There was little
difficulty in bringing Francis back to consciousness, but he ap
peared so weak tne doctor feared that he must have suffered
some internal injury. He just lay on the floor of the mine and
gasped. Under those circumstances it was most imprudent to
think of moving him to the surface, and almost certain death
to leave him in the depths of the mine. What was to be done?
The doctor was at his wits' end untii the superintendent
thought of obtaining a cathode ray outfit and finding out just
how much injury Francis had suffered. Mr. Fisher reached
San F rancisco that evening, and tbe next morning we .starter',
for the mine.
"We reached Milton without difficulty, and then began the
hard stage-ride to Sonora. It was necessary to drive as fast as
possible, and also n- cessary to be careful with the outfit. But
ihe driver made good time on the smooth places and went slow
where it was rough, so that we reached the mine in the after
noon, and I found the apparatus in good shape.
"We were told that Francis was still alive, and that the doc-

People call him the "Bulldog Man" and
that is as near as anyoody can get to his
real name He says that his name is no
body's business but his own and if they
want to find out what
it is they have got to
go somewhere else.

to talking about buil-

However, his chances
of selling them are
very slim, for he
has devoted his time
to that for nearly two
years and he still
owns the ugly brutes.
In appearance the bulldog man is much
like the type of the class kno*n as
"tough." He wears a threadbare suit of
the reeulation style, tight fitting and with
Bpring-botlom pants. His cap is of the
kind worn by bicyclists.
When the bulldog man first appeared
on the "Crawl" he said that he had just
arrived from Cincinnati. He had with
him two bulldog puppies that he was
anxious to sell. They were "cute" little
fellows with pink noses and attracted con
siderable attention whenever they made
bold enough to peep out of the pockets In
which he carried them. But he wanted

, he kept them.
lie came down in his prices after walk
ing up and down the streets a couple of
weeks, but his puppies were constantly
growing and he could not have obtained
25 cents apiece for them had he desired.
But he persevered and is still persevering
in spite of the fact that the puppies have
crown into large-sized dogs and are about
as mean and vicious creatures as can be
found in the State.
You can have them both for 75 cents if
you want them.

tor was more disturbed than ever. The injured man had suffered greatly during the
thirty-six hours that he lay in the mine. He would surely die if he were not
moved, and yet he was sure to die by being moved if he were injured internally.
"Getting the 350-pound apparatus down into the mine about 400 feet was no child's
play. Everything had to be handled carefully, so that there should be no failure now
that we had got so far.
"Everything went off perfectly, however, and I soon had the apparatus in working
order on the top of a couple of barrels. The storage batteries had to stay on the

Ralston Hart, as he signs his name, is
tie champion faker of the Kearny-street
"Crawl." He does nothing but fake, and
he seems to make a good living out of
it. Furthermore, bo
I has made a living out
I of it for many long
I months and during
I the hardest kind of
I times. But he believes
I that the crop of suck-
I ers never faiis.
Ralston has a colony

I large book aronrrd
I with him to put down

trade in the daytime, and always wears
his overalls at night, just to show that he
is a wortcingman.
The scheme that Ralston hopes to put
into working order is a complicated one.
But he explains it very nicely, and if a
man will only listen long enough the
whole affair will be made quite clear to
him.
Tbe way that Ralston does is to stand
on the corner and air his views until he
gets a crowd around him. He is sure to
catch one or more who desire greater in
formation on such an important subject
as the possibility of living without work.
He takes them to one side, induces them
to join and puts their names down, telling
them that they will have to pay nothing
until the colony is fully established, but
they must Btate the number of shares
they wonld like. That sounds good, and
the man generally states. Ralston closes
his book as if the deal were over, but inci
dentally remarks that all who pay 25
cents, or 10 cents, as the case may be, at
the time of handing in their names will be
entitled to a b\g rebate when the time
comes for settling up. Sometimes he gets

could be made. For all tbe doctor knew the slightest movement might result in
death. But there was no other way, as the size of the tube would not permit of the
work being done as be lay on the floor.
"Several men took hold of the injured man and gently seated him on a soap box.
where be said he felt able to remain without support. He leaned back, so that he just
touched the edge of the board on which the tube was placed, while a lriend kneeled
beside him, ready to give his support in case it was needed. We ail felt encouraged
when we reached this stage of the work.
"When the light was turned on I saw one of the strangest effects that I have yet
met with. The intense dampness of tbe air in the mine was acted on in some way by
the waves of light so that the whole interior of the tunnel was filled with a soft,

in the City. She says the silk was woven
for her especially at some of the famous
looms in Europe.
Whether Marie is telling the truth about
herself or not is of course something it
might be hard to prove, but according to
her own story she. was once Â« singer of
some reputation in Europe, although she
magnifies it to that of the most famous
singer in the world. She has not lost her

gagement because her prices are too high
for the managers to pay in these days of
cheap amusement.
It is about two years since Marie first
appeared on the "Crawl," and since that
time she has come out with astonishing
frequency. In fine weather not a day
passes without her trying to sell her pic
ture. She says the people are all her
friends and ought to be glad of the chance
to get such a beautiful picture of her at
such a low price.
The pictures she carries are old and
faded and must have been taken years ago.
The strange thing id that she occasionally
sells these pictures, but always has a sup

/\gain
Herman Fink is an industrious mar.,
and has been on the Kearny-street "Crawl"
for several years, engaged in a most nn
usual business. But he makes a living out of
it, and that is all he
I asks. In a way Herman
I is a beggar, for be goes
I from one store to an-
I other asking for the
I old pasteboard boxes
I that are usually
I thrown away. Some
I places are only too
I glad to give them to
I him, while otbers are
I likely to tell him to get
I out of the place, and
I if he don't go, to help
I him with a kick. As a
I result Herman has a
I number of places that
| he eoes to regularly.
He is a very mild-mannered man and
seems to be deserving of help. If told that
there is nothing for him he says, "Thank
you, just the same; good morning." It
might be mentioned that Herman eioes
his rounds only in the morning, as he has
another part of it to do in the afternoon.
The way that Herman puts a pile of
boxes in shape to carry is almost marvel
ous. He will tackle a pile almost as big
as a streetcar, and after a few minutes'
work go away with all of them under his
arm. Of course he does it by putting
them inside of one another, but he has a
remarkably quick eye to tell what sizes
will fit and those that will not.
Herman is not ashamed to say tnat he
sells the boxes that be collects this way.
He first takes them to his home, where he
examines them and patches them up.
For this work he keeps paper and paste,
and says he is able to do the work very
quickly.
He has a regular route of customers in
the cheap quarters of town among the
little notion-stores where boxes are occa
sionally needed, but where profits are not
large enough to warrant buying them. He
will sell two dozen boxes for about 5
cents, so his own profits are not large.

greenish glow. There were no shadows anywhere, although,
we darkened the place as much as possible. The faces of the
men took on the most frightened expressions and a few of the
superstitious ones seemed ready to run away. It was the action
on the retina, I suppose, but the rays from the lamp appeared
to move from the center in all directions and gave everything a
quivering effect.
"Dr. Bromley had never looked through a fluorescent screen
before and when I put it in the proper position and told him to
proceed with his examination he gave one glance and then
started as if he were struck. He came back in a moment, how
ever, and finished his examination, which showed that there
was no internal injury and that it was Rafe to move Francis.
"Here was another strange thing. The way that the bones
of Francis showed through the screen down in the mine was
plainer than I have ever seen before and I have used the same
instrument hundreds of times. It was possible to detect the
slightest indentations and the injured parts showed the small
est cracks in the ends of the bones. It was really the most suc
cessful examination that I have made.
"While the examination was going on down in thÂ« mine
a crowd of men stood around the opening at the top.
As soon as they beard that there was no danger of Francis
dying of his injuries a cheer went up that did us all good to
hear. He was moved to the top in a short time, and at onca
began to feel better. The doctor came to the conclusion that
his depression was caused by cold.
"Of course the examination showed that there was really
no need of the examination having been made at all. But
nobody knew that until after it had been made. Jfrancis was
a lavorite with the men, and bis employers thought the world
of him, so that they were only too glad that the examination
was made.
"After the examination was made and Francis sleeping
quietly in his bed the miners asked for an exhibition of tbe
X rays, which I gave to them in one of the buildings. The
strange thing about this was that many of them got the idea
that the rays could detect anything, and asked me to go to
some of their claims and examine the hanging walls so as to
ascertain whether or not there was any gold on the insidt of
the rocks. They were almost offended when I told them it
could not be done. But they were greatly pleased at what
they had seen, and I was delighted at the result of the trip.
I think it is safe to say that it was the first time that an X
ray outfit was ever taken down into a mine."
The demand for X-ray outfits is on the increase. Mr. Van
der Naillen is engaged in the manufacture of them, and has
recently started a plant in this City for their manufacture.
He finds it hard work to fill his orders. The apparatus is
mostly for physicians, who by its use are enabled to be sure
of what they are doing. The outfits are to be sent all over
the State, and the manufacture of them in this City marks
the beginning of a new industry.

His Gracing for the

SKoWs
All day long is Julius Lans's time on
the Kearny-street "Crawl," and it is safe
to say that he has a better time than any
other man in all tbe Golden State. Oh,
how much he does
I enjoy himself.
But Julius is built
I to enjoy himself. He
I has all the qualifica-
I tions -a good appe-
I tite, a eooil physique
I and a good disposi-
I tion. He weighs
I about 250 pounds
I and he carries this
I heavy load about
I from early morn un-
I til iate at night.
Julius first appears
I upon the scene be-
I fore most of the
stores are open, hunt
ing for his breakfast He gets that on the
"Crawl," and has a large number of
places to choose from, after which he be
gins hia day's sport.
Tnis consists of "taking in" all of the
cheap side shows that line the street from
Bush to Washington. It makes no differ
ence whether he has seen them before or
notâ he must see them again. So in he
goes, and if there is any sort of a game of
chance going on he is sure to try it. The
shooting galleries are his favorite places,
nlthoush he never wins anything. The
game that he enjoyed the most, however,
was that of ''throwing eggs at the coon."
He spent many dollars there, and almost
exhausted the supply of decayed hen
fruit on more than one occasion ; but it is
not recorded that he ever succeeded in
hitting the head of thÂ« dodging African.
Julius has almost lived on Kearny
street for over a year, and has done more
to support the fakers there than any man
in town. He passes from one place to an
other, and when he has gone the rounds
be besins all over again. He says that
America furnishes more gooa amusement
than any other country in the world, and
that San Francisco is at the head of the
list.

HAool's type he ; has

Hof a scheme as he
Mmight be drawn into
Hhimself were ,he not
L^L^L^L^L^L^L^L^Hengaged in doing the

peal to an Oriental like the knowledge
that he " has become possessed of some
body else's secret and can when the time
comes strike that person to earth.
He can be seen two or three evenings
out of each week passing alone Kearny
street carrying â ', a satchel with the words
"State papers" painted on the side. Nat
urally, with his foreign make-up, he at
tracts attention and is not slow in en
ticing his questioner to a quiet place where
the police are not likely to disturb them.
It is then that Aool tells his victim that
he has some of the greatest secrets of the
Turkish ; empire in the satchel; that he
is a representative of the Sultan but lost
his money so that he has not even enough
to Day for a bed. He may open the satchel
and show papers â¢ covered with bis., seals
and .' mysterious characters ; so that . the
victim is impressed enough ' to . let thÂ«
schemer have a little casa on the promise
that it will be given back 'the next night.
But the lender must not breathe a word
about the transaction.
When the next night comes Aool is not
to be seen and if he should ever happen

BRUSSELS, Sept. 27.â Standing in the
great square in the neart of the town, un
der the shadow of the ancient and splen
did Hotel de Ville, looking at tbe dark
and ornate facade of the "House of the
King." it is not difficult to reconstruct for
oneself the scenes from a past, presenting
as vivid a contrast of magnificence and
cruel tragedy as can be found in the his
tory of any country. It is eminently a
peaceful scene at present, however.
Hiah above the city on the summit of a
hill that is cnt into and covered by close
little streets that scramble up the preci
pitous sides iike the streets of Chinatown
in San Francisco is the Koyai Palace, the
principal hotels, the little green park that
was once the pleasure-ground of the
Dukes of Brabant, the museum?, the most
elegant shops and the residences of the
Belgian aristocracy. Here, too, the
foreigners congregate â the well-to-do
Englishman; the astute American, not
rich enough to cut a wide swaih in New
York or London; the impoverished aristo
crat, too proud to economize at home.
Here in the gay little capital, that is half
Spanish, half Flemish, wholly French,
life is simple and pleasure smiles and
every one may enjoy much and spend
little.
The palace of the Doges in Venice, all
that is sumptuous and rich in Italian
decoration, comes back into the recol-
Jectio;: as we wander through the silent
rooms of the Hotel de Vine behind a
whispering guide and a row of Baeueker
ized tourists.
If you enter by the lion's staircase you
come at once into the banqueting hall,
carved in oak, with beautiful Gothic de
signs, and tapestry, green as a forest, set
into the spaces of tbe wails. It is possible
that you also may experience an incident
not down in Baedeker. A woman in a
very gorgeous bonnet, with a heavy beaded
cape and a tailor-made skirt, a guide
book under her arm, enters from the oppo
site door.
Unconsciously the contrast between this
modern woman and the women of tlie
older regime presents itself. Take, for
example, Margaret of Parma. There are
portraits of her everywhere, this queenly
half-sister of Philip of Spain, who was
more weak than wicked, more sinned
against than sinning. She ia woven in
tapestry and carved in wood; her face,
that has the characteristic long upper lip
and the protruding lower one, can be dis
covered in the great corporation pictures,
painted to commemorate some especially
important occasion, and in the museums
there are sny number of portraits. She
must have presented a. noble appearance
in her black velvet, slashed with white
satin, hung with gold chains and set with
jewels. She carried herself with a majesty
that is so noble it seems incomprehensi
ble that she. couU have surrendered all
her gooa intentions to the people she
reigned over â that she can ever have vol
untarily submitted to being the tool of
her pitiless brother, the instrument in the
hands of the Inquisition.
The imposing Gothic cathedral is ap
proached by the little black streets that
make it seem largerâ more grandiose by
contract. What patience, what richness
of detail did tbe?e ol'i masters develop!
Every portion of the church was as
patiently studied out and decorated and
covered with designs as a lacemaker picks
and stitches at the cobweb daintiness
under her fingers. And there is some
thing lite tbe same elegance and fineness
of detail in the stone lacework with which
the Flemish architect loved to cover the
severity of his design.
The confessional-boxes are miracles of
wood-carving. Two angels, mild and
grave, guard each little door, and above
it gariands and ribbons and little winged
heads are cut in the dark rich wood. The
windows are fine, like mosaics of jewels,
as all stained glass must be; even the
moderr. ones are not as bad as they might
be. Tbe monuments of Counts Egmont
and Hoom stands before the old Egmont
palace, now In the possession of the Due
d'Arenberg. A little further away, be
hind the gloomy front of the prison for
female convicts, is the restored palace of
the Count Kuylenburg, where the Belgian
nobles met and conspired to begin the
struggle against the supremacy Â»f Spain.
It was here that they signea the petition,
begging Margaret of Parma to abolish the
Inquisition. What a scene it must have
been before the palace of the Princess.
Margaret, surrounded by her courtiers in
si! their southern richness of apparel,
the four hundred knights of the aristoc
racy of Brabant, silent, fixed, stern and
resolute, waiting to have their petition
granted or to die in enforcing It.
The Due of Aiva had to be summoned to
quell those "oeegars," and even his inso
lent and pitiless cruelty was not sufficient.
Thouph he led twenty-five of them into
the square and executed them on a scaf
folding erected so high that the peopie
could not rescue their heroes, though he
set himself and his court in their palace
and afterward burned it to tbe eround,
Btill, a few years later, the Netherlands
were separated from Spain. The Spaniards
left their traces upon the blonde Flemish
race, and it is curious even now in the
faces of tbe people, flower venders and
women in the little sbops, to see some
times under the straight, lignt hair a pair
of dark, soft Spanish eyes.
All Americans in Brussels go at once to
the Wiertz Museum ,to see the horrors
which that half-insane artist loved to por
tray. They shiver delightfully before the
painted terrors of a decapitated head, glue
their eyes; to â  a hole in the wall in which
they may perceive a subterranean vault in
which a human being, ghastly as death, is
struggling to escape from a coffin. Or a
nude figure rewards them for the humili
ating necessity of .bending down to a little
black hole in the wall. If this is art it is
a very revolting form of It. , Â«
What a contrast is the work of that
greatest of Belgian artists, Alfred Stevens.
How delicate and refined -and thoroughly
cultured is his every canvas. Outside of
Paris there are no better examples than
those in the Modern Mnsenm, the figure
of a woman holding a Japaneseornainent,
the fashionable woman in a dress that is so
charmingly painted that we forget to
notice that the fashion is already an old
one. Van Dyck Brown.

The Burly Jramp Who
Failed to Bluff
the Small
Qirl
The extent to which San Francisco
streets are devoid of trees cannot well be
realized irom any point of observation less
commanding than the Twin Peaks. Once
up on the Peaks, the City looks nearly all
gray. The business streets are absolutely
devoid of bright color, and if there are oo
casional trees on such thoroughfares they
are so few and are so much scattered, that
they cut no figure in tbe landscape.
The great bulk of residence streets
have the same general appearance
of pray, the distance and the average
tone blending them so that any slight
variation of colors is imperceptible.
The only wooded section on the entire
peninsula, apart from the parks and
Presidio areas, is all west of the Peaks,
and tbe preen tops of the tree plantations
toward the ocean are a grateful sight.
San Francisco, as a whole, is garbed in
gray, but in other respects is not particu
larly suggestive of the Quakers.

Nothing develops the precocity of chil
dren in a certain part of the City more
than to put them in actual contact with
adults. There are small girl cashiers in
cheap restaurants who are able to bluff
the most burly and threatening rounder
on the Barbary Coast.
Clear above the clatter of the dishes and
the general din of a cheap restaurant on
Clay street two voices rang out. One was
a pass voice oelonKing to the genus tramp,
and he was as large and burly a man as
could be foend in many a day. The other
voice proceeded from the vocal apparatus
of a thin, white-faced child whose age
could not have exceeded 11 or 12 years.
"I gave yer two bits," said the bass voice,
"and I want me change."
"Two bits nawthin'; yer gave me 10
cents and yer hain't got no change a corn
in'."
"Gur-rghl" This was a growl of much
fierceness.
"Ha, ha! ho, ho!" laughed the 11-year
oider, mockinely. "Dats all right, but
yer don't bluff worth a nickel."
"I'll have yer pulled."
Around tbe tables sat groups of listen
ing men who miprht be waiting to "try on"
this game themselves. They scraped
hairy chins meditatively and looked on
with an appearance of a grim sort of
amusement.
. The email girl was mistress of the situa- '
tion. "Now git," she said, for t I won't
have no fuss about here! Now mosey 1". ' ;
. The bluff would not go. The big tramp
went out. The little girl sprunted up like
a bantam chicken as " another tramp
offered familiarity on the strength of this
episode. Business then resumed its

Wonderful Jale of
a Liar from
Ohio
JKe Ungrateful Con

peculiar Dry
Plate
Professor Laurence Abbott of Chilli
cothe, Ohio', is a guest at a downtown ho
tel. Last night he appeared to be an in
tensely disgusted man. He has just re
turned to San Francisco from Japan, where
he dallied for a time after having accom
panied Professor Todd on Mr. James'
beautiful yacht Coronet.
Professor AbhoU is not an astronomer,
but, according to his own relation of his
accomplishments, is a photographer from
whom the scientific expedition might
safely have looked for the most remart
able results. He said: "For years I be
longed 10 the ministry, and attained a cer
tain amount of celebrity, not confined to
the immediate vicinity of my labors. The
salary attached to tbe church wherein I
labored waa not as large as it might well
have been, taking into consideration the
wealth and size of my conereuation,
coupled with my indefatigable researches
into every field of science and branch of
religion, which I prosecuted for their en
lightenment.
â¢'At many sessions of th 9 council the
matter of an increase came up, but
never materialized. Ere long my growing
family made it incumbent on me todevise
other means for increasing the domestic
exchequer, and I finally hit upon the plan
of having my eldest son, a bright lad of 18
years, pursue the 6tudy of photography.
I also became thoroughly interested with
him, which later on proved a most fortu

adopted the plan of having printed on the
back of the 'contribution cards,' which
were left in the pews for subscriptions to
home and foreign missions, the following:
'Go to Abbott's groun.l floor gallery for

"Much to my surprise, this caused quite
an unwarranted amount oi discussion

Enormous Bands of
the Queer Brutes
or\ the Yukon
RWer.
"When I left Circle City early in
August, and from which I have just now
arrived," said William Dalton, the Cali
fornia gold digger, yesterday, who has
been for three years mining on tbe Yukon,
â¢Marge bands of cariboo were coming over
the mountains from the north and run
nine south.
"In some of these band* there were as
many as from 3000 to 5000 cariboo at a
time. They were moving in immense
masses. I had frequently seen them be
fore, for every fall and spring the cariboo
start on tbeir regular pilgrimages. In tbe
spring they go north and in the fall they
move south again.
"It is a beautiful sight to see them. They
are huge animals, and when you get a few
thousands of them together, the great
horns make them in the distance look like
a moving forest.
"I have seen them make a path two
miles wide in the snow. I was mining on
Hogham Creek, and when the cariboo be
gan to cross tne divide north of tbe camp
there were so many that it took between
three and four days for them to get over.
"The cariboo usually string along very
leisurely, but as soon as the boys in camp
see them they begin to shoot, and then
the cariboo start to running. They don't
gallopâ they trot, and they trot a good
deal faster than a horse.
"Beyond the divide, and between tbe
Yukon and the Tanana River, is tbe
Tanana divide, and there at these two
seasons may also be seen large bands of
cariboo. The cariboo come from every
direction, so that wherever you go you
see moving masses of them.
"It was thus that they were pouring, over
the hills when I left. The Tanana is a big
river, navigable for steamboats for 600
miles, and everybody knows more or less
of the great size of the Yukon. There are
many other rivers besides the Tanana
whicb empty into tbe Yukon.
"When the cariboo come to any of these
they Bimply plunge in and swim. Nothing
impedes them. However, when they have
their choice they keep up on the hills.
"It is said that many of these cariboo
spend a good part of the year among some
almost bare mountains north of the
Tanana. Tbe crests of tbe mountains are
granite, and it is as smooth as the tiles in
a floor.
"The cariboo there and elsewhere live
on tlis moss that grows in parts of these
mountains. They have a spoonlike horn,
that is wide and flat, and with this they
scrape away the snow and get at the moss.
It acts as a sort of shovel and answers
the purpose admirably.
"The cariboo have very big feet, which
spread out and keep them on top of the soft
snow. There is a big deerclaw on each
foot, and this helps them, so that tbe foot
as a whole spreads out like a fan.
"In the fall the cariboo will dress from
300 to 400 pounds each, when full grown,
but in the spring they are so poor they
don't weigh more than half that much.
In the fall and winter the bulls and oows
go in different communities, but always
kee ping near together.
"I never expect to see a more inspiring
sight than these cariboo as they inova
b&cK and forth in their migrations. It is
worth a lot of money, and when one has
seen it he will never forget it.
"There are some moose there, but they
are by no means so plentiful as tbe cari
boo. I saw five once, but that was the
most I ever saw at any one time. There
are no mountain sheep or goats there, so
far as I have observed, but down on the
Hoo Talinka you find both sheep and

Jpolitics and Religion
Combined by a
Strange |leW
Sect
There is in Los Angeles a church move
ment so extraordinary in the character of
its creed as to be without parallel or an
ticipation by the creed of any ecclesiasti
cal idea ever before brought into the world.
In point of fact the only semblance of
ecclesiasticism which this movement
bears abides in its name of "churcu" and
in the fact that it expresses itself to be a
form of the worship of God. Ot!ier than
this there is nothing about its officers, its
meetings, or any ceremonies thereof which
might suggest it to embody a phase of
religious thought as religious thought â 
comes to us to-day through articles of
faith, psalters and edifices.
This newly originated institution ia
called New Era church, and it was brought
into being througn a State charter granted
upon the filing of articles of incorpora
tion in 1894. Dr. W. C. Bowman was the
originator of the idea of such a church
and stood at the helm while it was getting
into shape. He calls it a "civic church,"
and as such it has spread until the Los
Angeles body now numbers about 700
members, and there are churches at Comp
ton, Azusa and Clearwater, each of them
having as great a membership as any of
the "old line" churches which are in those
towns. Altogether it might be said that
tbe membership of the church is about
1000, but from this nucleus tbe church olii
rers declare the faith will spread, as the
present activities show, until it becomes
the most conspicuous church, movement
in the State.
The idea is recognized by some as about
the same sort of breaking off from the or
thodox faith as Protestantism was from
Catholicism. It is bated upon the claim
that the churches of to-day assert that
their only purpose is to cars for tbe souls
of individuals, and have no concern for
their earthly well-being farther than ob
tains to morality and charity, the last of
which graces tbe New Eras declare is, "in
its church acceptation and practice, simply
a fraud."
In short, this New Era church mingles
politics with religion, and of the two runs
mostly to politics. There is no regular
preacher, and the sermons bear no flavor
of theology. Twice on Sunday the mem
bers gather to hear discour-es. A brother
or sister will rise and deliver a prepared or
extemporaneous address. He may take
some Bible theme for his base of argument,
but if he does he will use it only as a wall
from behind which shots will be taken at
political questions of the day.
After this is finished some member will*
arise and comment upon tbe words just
spoken; this will continue until a dozen
others have spoken. All sorts of subjects
will be talked on. Socialism comes in for
a large part of the speechmaklng, for many
of the members are socialists; then there
are protectionists, ardent and excitabla
free-traders, sin.le-taxers, goldites, silver
ites, those who want tbe railroads owned
by the Government, those who want only
the roadbeds owned and the traffic man
agement thrown open to competition,
those who wish Government ownership of
the telegraph and who are otherwise op
posed to socialism.
One of the sections of tbe constitution
of this church reads:
In matters of belief and opinion there will
be absolute liberty of mind to accept whatever
Is proved or seems probable and to reject
whatever is diiproved or seemi improbable;
and that its range of investigation and in
struction will be unlimited, drawing freely
from all Â»ourcesâ scientific, literary, historic,
ancient and modern, sacred and profane,
Christian, Jewish and paganâ drawing most
largely from those sources which seem ln
itruntive aud helpful, freeiy handling every
question in the problem of bumsu Ufa and
aspiration, whether relating to this life or tbe
life to come, or whether concerniug the body
or the soul of man.
The expressions of its founder, Dr. Bow
man, as to the beliefs of tbe church are
much in line with the above. He says:
"We believe that the surest way to take
care of another life is to make tbe best
possible success out of this one; to make
earth itself as much like heaven as possi
ble; a place of equal rights to all and spe
cial privileges to none."
The absolute lack of theological doctrine
in the structure of this church appears,
however, in what is specifically declared
to be its creed, which reads as follows: J
I believe in the eternal principles of justice
and righteousness, embosomed in the Infinite
aoul of the universe, revealed in the face of
nature and the expert essences of human life.
I believe in the betterment of the world by
endless progress. I believe in the triumph of
light over darkness, good over evil and life
over death. I believe that the earth, with its
Stored resources, its bounties, and civilization
with its blessings are the rightful heritage of
tbe people, and that all should have fair play
and an equal showing for plenty and comiort.
I believe it is wrong for the few, whether by
Inheritance, shrawdnew or unjust laws, to
have more of life's substance than they can
earn or need while the multitude have less
than they can earn or need; wrong far the
few to have control of the means and necessi
ties of liie bo that tbe many are. compelled to
beg at their feet for the privilege of working
for something to eat and wear; wrong for the
public necessities to be in private bands. I
believe it is wroug for a part of the people to
be licensed by law to make criminals, paupers,
vagabonds and suicides while the rest pray,
plead and bear burdens. I believe it is wrong
for the teachers and preachers ot the world to
be silent about tliÂ«se great wrongs for fear
somebody will think they are meddling with
politics.
The literature of this new church does
not seem as yet to have narrowed to any
particular sacred boot. It has neither
Bible, Book of Mormon, or Talmud; in
fact, the whole range of written words
which the past has produced is recog
nized as beine its stock of publications, its
reservoir of food for thought.

tke ffigkt of tke 13tk
Toward the close of the present century,
probably in 1899, the world will again
witness the great meieor shower that
occurs every thirty-three years. This is
the rarest of celestial phenomena visible
at night time. Hundreds of thousands
of shooting stars streaked the heavens
with radiance for hours in succession on
the last occasion In 1866-67. Abo in 1833-34,
and in 1799, when observed by Humboldt
in South America; and the historic record
of the periodic display, which dates
back nearly a thousand years, turnishes
similar accounts. As the visibility of the
swarm is not confined to every thirty
thira year, but commences a few years
before, and lingers on a few years after
that period, it is now expected that during
next month the foremost ranks of the ad
vancing host will make their appearance
in unusual numbers.
Even as early as 1892 Professor Barnard
of the Yerkes Observatory saw some indi
cations of this, though the intervening
years revealed only the few stragglers of
the swarm usually seen on the 13th of No
vember or about that date, for it requires
some days for the earth to pass the inter
section of the meteoric path.
The clear skies of California and the
favorable weather often seen in November
make it a vantage-ground for such an
observation. No doubt, as on previous
occas-ions, the Mount Hamilton astron
omers will carry on a co-ODerative watch
on several steep heights and thus detsr
mine the orbit of the swarm with the de
sired accuracy.
From the bay, with the City as a
background, one may easily obtain
an exceptionally good visual observation
of the expected phenomenon. Tamalpais,
now so easy of access, will probably be
selected by many local observers for a long
night vigil, as even visually it is worth
many a weary watch to witness the effect
from such a magnificent standpoint.
Even an ascent to any of the City
heights, where a clear -view of the horizon
ali round is obtainrd, and with the local
scenery of bay, bills and ocean canopied
by such a rare and wonderful night scene,
will fully repay the fatigue endured. Such
a celestial vigil would be an invigorating
change from the glare, heat and suffoca
tion of the theater or ordinary nipht en
tertainment, even if the great star shower
failed to appear.
During an eieht hours' watch on the
13th of last November thirty-seven swift,
pale-tinted Leonids were seen streaking
the soutnern constellations. This is the
name given to the November star shower
that seems to radiate from the constella
tion of Leo. When a number of shooting
meteors streak tne firmament the area
from which they all retreat in common,
in divergent tracts, is named the radiant
point, and it shows the direction in space
from which they approach the earth's
orbit.
Scientific investigation carried on chiefly
within the last sixty-three years has shown
that myriads' of small, dark bodies are
circling through interplanetary spaces,
sometimes singly, olten in groups, and
also in immense swarms; that in w> ight
they range from many tons to a lew grains
or less, and while too small to be seen
individually shining by reflected sunlight
and too far apart to glimmer conjointly,
occasional friction with the earth's atmo
sphere gives them a luminosity that re
veals their existence. When a small, cold,
hard body ranging the realms of space
with tremendous speed encounters even
the vapory envelope of the swiftly moving
earth the twofold velocity heatu it to a
blaze and generally reduces it to ashes in
a few seconds. Hence the falling star
that in golden script tells the route of the
unseen host that is speeding by. The
scientific observer marks the aspect, mo
tion, distance orspectrum of the luminous
wanderer, and if it falls to the earth before
being consumed analyzes its constituents.
Composed only of such well-known sub
stances as iron, stone and sodium it never
theless bears the brand of its non-ter
restrial origin and also the traces of its
fiery flight. Th â  Leonids belongs to the
largest of known swarms. In a long el
liptic orbit, intersecting that of the earth
at one point and extending beyond that
of the planet Uranus at the opposite curve,
they revolve round the sun in about
thirty-three and a quarter years, the
elongated stream taking some years to
cross the path of our planet. But the
grand mystery of the meteoric host is
their unexplained relationship to the
wandering comet, so unlike in aspect and
ways and still so evidently entangled in
some common bond. Schiaparelli of
Miltn, so famed for the discovery of the
cant.is of Mars, was toe first to detect a J
connection between a comet and a meteor
shower, the Perseids, the comparatively
small shower seen in August. In Decem-'
ber, 1865, a small comet was seen from
Marseilles, which received the name of its
discoverer, Tenipel.
It arrived ut its perihelion in January
and the following November appeared the
wonderful meteoric display of 1866. When
the orbits were calculated some time
afterward by different observers they were
found to be identical, thus showing that
the swarm was following in the path of
the comet. Foremost among American
observers in computations and theories
connected with meteoric astronomy was
the late Professor H. A. Newton of Yale
University, who died but a few weeks ago.
He inclined to the opinion thkt shooting
stars were caused by the gradual disin
tegration of comets. Not long ago at a
meeting of the American Philosophical
Society, in speaking of this subject, he
explained that the sun was the cause oi
the different directions sometimes taken
by the disintegrated particles of a comet.
"The material," he stated, "that goes off
from the comet, after it leaves it, is sub
ject to a force like that of attraction, but
differing from it in intensity. In the case
of the tail, it is a repulsive force."
In further explanation of this unsettled
problem, he added: "It looks to me as
though there was a disintegration all along:
the line of the comet's orbit, giving us
small particles with all sorts of loads of
electricity, and all sorts of differences of
central attraction and differences of orbits,
and thus they get widely scattered, so as to
give us the showers a long distance
from the comet itself."
Other astronomers, however, consider
that the meteor condition is prior to the
cometary condition, while Profetsor East
man of Washington is of opinion that the
connection is unproven, though atleasi
four comets are known to have cer
tainly moved in the paths of meteor
swarms.
This cautious view is entitled to much
consideration, as about a hundred mete
oric orbits are known with which there
seems to be no cometary connection. On
the other hand, the vastness of space even
within the solar system discourages the
beiief that two distinct formations could
select one rath with all its peculiar curves
unless forced to do so by some irresistible
bond. Some computers account for the
difference of the periods of a comet and its
WONDERFUL GROWTH OF A MILES GRAPEVINE
meteoric debris and for any differences
detected in the orbit by the theory of
planetary interference. Indeed the pres
ent orbit of the Leonids and their a'tend
ant comet may be due to the attraction of
the planet Uranus, near which they must
have passed in the year A. D. 126, accord
ing to the French mathematician and
astronomer Leverrier, who was so instru
mental in discovering this cometary con
nection.
It is to test the accuracy of all former
observations, from which bo many inter
esting deductions have been made, and
by means of the new appliances and
methods unknown on the last occasion to
either confirm or refute them, that the
a>tronomers are now preparing to in
vestigata the foremost wing of the flying
host. If a premature large shower siiould
escape scientific scrutiny and be merely a
hearsay, important evidence would have
to be supplied by unsatisfactory con- j
jecture. Dr. Elkin of Yale College has de
vised an instrument for the special pur
pose of photographing meteors, and bis
plans have been effectively carried out by
Warner & Swasey of Cleveland, who con
structed the mounting of the Lick tele
scope. It is a sextuple pnotographic tele
scope, or rather a combination of six tele
scopes with cameras attached, mounted
on the one polar ax.s, guided by the same
motions and circles ami controlled by one
operator. Jointly the.' can picture an
area of the firmament. equal to tbatcovered

In the meantime other single telescopes
will be placed a few miles distant, and by
means of electrical connections co-operat
] ive motions will take place in all simul
i taneously. The object is to accomplish as
! much as possible in a limited time, and
i this is exactly what is needed for meteoric
photo .raphy. The sre.truni of a shoot
inu star is a difficult observation to take,
but owing to the skill and zeal of those
engaged in that branch of astronomy it
will probably be obtained very correctly
before the end of the century.

with elaborate and expensive contrivances
who can engage in valuable observations.
Thn radiant points of the meteor swarms
have been necessarily decided by visual
estimates. The falling star gives no time
for measurements. Any attentive star
gazer that has a celestial globe or map in
readiness can mark on it the seeming
routes, and then at leisure prolong them
in the directions contrary to that of the
flights. The meetine point of the various
lines will be the radiant of the swarm, for
as they really approach the earth in nearly
parallel lines their divergent tracks are a
matter of perspective from our standpoint.

almost in a short zouave fashion to show a deep belt of hya
cinth-tinted miroir velvet, which also forms the vest and revers,
decked with an applique of Brussels point, edged with a fine

of gold tissue worked witti glittering hyacinth beads on thick

frill of Brussels point peeps from the hem. A truly fascinating
garment, almost equally worthy of admiration, is one of black
satin emb r oidered in jet sequins and striped with broad bands
of black velvet ribbon. The lining is of black and white striped
silK with a pale chine pattern upon it. Chinchilla outlines the
shoulder, and the collar encircling the neck is tied with velvet

an applique of green velvet traced witn jet, with steel and with
green chenille and gold. The smallest of black ostrich tips edce

Very popular, d oubtless, will also be a creation recalling
the atyles of 1830. The especial one to which I allude is of a

to be fully appreciated), with a yoke gathered round the

There has come into bearing this season,
on the ranch of the California Nursery
Company, near Niles, a most remarkable
new variety of grapevine that promises to
be of the greatest importance to the wine
growing industry of the State and also to
the producers of table grapes. The new
variety of grape is the result of grafting a
cutting of a Royal Isabella on the root
of a common Isabella. As a consequence
it has qualities unknown before. How
it was brought about is purely a matter of
speculation, but most likely through what
is known as "bud variation." This is not
thoroughly understood, but many able
writers say it is on account of the mixture
of the pollen of different plants either by
insects or the wind.
The new grape while possessing all the
qualities of the native American Isabella
has the flavor of the Asiatic and Spanish

the east and approaches the zenith. While
it may be premature to expect too much
this year, still if preparation were not
made and the shooting stars appeared in
greater numbers the omission could not
be remedied until far into the next cen-
tury. In astronomical work forecast is
often of high value. Rose O'Halloeak.
Jhe Vibrations of Light
One of the mo3t promising fields for in
ventors, one in which may be reaped
great fortune, is that of illumination. The
perfect light is yet a thing of the future
True, very great progress has been made
in the matter of lighting our homes and
workshops, our churches, theaters and
streets, but there is very much more to be
accomplished before it can be said, that
in all respects, our artificial light is per
fect.
The science of natural physics teaches
One of the latest se.ilskm capes has large revers and
uprii ht collar; the latter turns down in front in points.
A carriage or evening coat of r chest moire velours lined
with satin is one of the latest models. The collar is lined with
Russian sable and a sable flounce under a ribbon ruche sur
rounds the square yofce and forms a deep point behind Watteau
backs in two organ nates. Two sable heads.fasten the cloak to
the figure under the Wattpau pleat in front.
A sca-f of soft silk forms a bow behind the collar and is
clasped by a diamond buckle at the throat, falling gracefully to
t c feet. It has a fringe of sable tails. A design I like far
better is carried out in a white silk closely covered with a tiny
blue flower, which shows a yoke and collar of pale blue velvet
traced with silver and damante; three quillings of pale blue
satin ribbon adorn the hem and over the shoulders fall long
straps of skunk. Yet another beautiful model. It is described
as a pale green tinsel brocade long coat, with a pattern in
pink, and shows a distinct novelty in its trimming of three rows
of fur headed with jet beads. This has a Watteau back, double
jabot-like revers of pale green trimmed witn fur and elaborate
kiltings of chiffon. Cream-colored lace falls lightly over the
epaulettes of pleated chiffon on the shoulders, and the sleeves
are of bell shape, while the lining is of pale pink. A short sack
coat of black velvet has a conventional design of green velvet
traced with gold and jet epaulettes, and collar of caracule, and
the coat falls away to show a belt both back and front of green
velvet.
varieties. This seems to be all that is de
sired as a wine grape, for it is .phylloxera
proof and full of fine-flavored juice. The
new vine is only two years old and yet it
has more grapes on it than any other vine
on the ranch. Ordinarily grapes are not
supposed to be in bearing at ali until they
are four years old, but the ancestry of the
new grape makes this quality of the vine
only a natural consequence.
"This new vine," said John Rock, when
exhibiting the vine, "will most likely
prove to be the most important addition
to the viticulture of California that has
been made in many years. From present
indications it will practically Rouble the
bearing capacity of the vineyard in which
it grows. It is the most prolific bearer
that I have ever seen. If the older vines
show the same, and I see no reason why
they should not, an 80-acre vineyard can

the red light of the spectrum is red be
cause it is the optical expression of "some
thing" vibrating at a speed of over thirty
seven trillions per second of time. That
the violet light is Violet because it is the
optical expression of the same "some
thing" vibrating at a speed of eighty
seven trillions per second, and that the
other color-lights are the optical expres
sions of vibrations of the "something" at
speeds intermediate between the rates of
the red and the violet. The "something"
is the matter ruling all interstellar space.
When the vibrations of all the color
lights are present the optical expression
of color is merged into a whole, producing
what is termed "white" light.
Some very curious and interesting ex
periments have recently been made in
the matter of light-vibration which are
extremely suggestive. A glass globe hav

grow as much grapes of the dry-wine va
riety as a 150-acre can with any of the
vines we have to-day.
"It is, of course, impossible to say ex
actly what the new grape will produce
when it comes to growing it in different
localities, but there is little doubt but that
it will do all that it should do from the
calculations we can make now. It will be
several years before we have any amount
of cuttings to send out. This year there
will be about fifty cuttings from this vine
and the next year about ten irom each of
the new vines. The third year we should
have about 10,000 young vines and the
fourth year enough to distribute."
As the vine appears in the accompany
ing drawing there are no leaves in front of
the grapes, but these were all cut off at the
time the photograph was made so as to
show them.
SUNSHINE AT NIGHT
Startling Possibilities of a perfect
Light from Vibration
Tesla's Experiments and tke Universal
Force Tkat QiVes to All Jkirvgs
and Inkeres in All
The globe contained no filament, as does
the incandescent lamp, neither was it
connected by any wires to the electrical
machine. Yet it gave out light.
The phenomenon is explained by the
experimenter, Tesla, thusly: The ex
haustion is not carried to an absolute
vacuum, and under the influence of elec
trical excitement produced by an aura of
extremely high-tensioned electricity the
atomic particles of matter remaining in the
gloDe are driven from side to side of the
globe with inconceivable rapidity, and the
fierce bombardment of these invisible
atoms impinging upon the walls of the
globe produce the light. If Mr. Tesla
had said that he had so exhausted
the globe as to produce within its walls
an approximation of the density of
interstellar space, and that he had
then, by the presence of a high potential
electrical field, excited the atoms within
the globe to a rate of vibration agreeing
with that of light he would have told the
| truth in plainer language.
But while Tesla's light is as yet along
way from being a practical illuminator it
is of great value in showing the possibili
ties of future illumination. It demon
strates far more and clearer than does any
other known experiment the electrical
character of light. I mean by this not the
production of light by or from electricity,
but the fact that as between electricity
and light there is only a difference in the
rate of their respective vibrations.
There is no good reason why human
genius should not be able to construct a
light operating solely by vibration and re
quiring no special electrical machine for
its maintenance. That it will be produced
in the near future is the belief of many
whose world-wide reputations as practical
scientists remove them from all fears of
being called visignary.
Such will be the perfect light. Cheap,
safe and not detrimental to health.
In the mind of the student of science,
no matter in what special field his inves
tigations have been conducted, there is
one dominant idea, the crystallization of
all the philosophy acquired as the result
of long and patient research, the axiom
born of his labors, thus expressed : All
nature is motion. Tba geologist, the
chemist, the astronomer, the biologist,
alike agree in summing up the result of
their various studies, experiments and in
vestigations, as establishing the fact that
all nature is in motion. There is going on
a continual transmutation of elements and
existences. Nowhere is there found abso
lute rest. It is nothing new to make such
announcement, and yet it is spoken of as
the keynote of the new science. It is be
cause men, in their struggle to attain
accomplishment of the desires of the
moment,. have been interested only in the
results and not in the causes, that the trne
conception of the universal power has not
been had. In the mad race for dollars
mankind has had no time for the analysis
of philosophy. The metaphysician is an
unwelcome stranger in the halls of the
money changer, and his philosophy the
recipient of contempt Yet there have
always been a few, rapidly increasing their
numbers to-day, who hold that meta
physics is not a mere empty bubble, but a
philosophy of life.
It was taught by the ancients that every
thing in the universe was of a homogene
ou.s nature and based upon one common
substance that they called "primary mat
ter." Aristotle declared that "all things
are convertible into ali things."
The greatest difficulty in the way of
propagating scientific truth is the over
coming of the belief in so-called scientific
teachings that are the veriest myths, the
respect for which is founded solely upon
personal regard for th- men who brought
them into the world. Tyndall has a high
claim in the temple of science; yet he has
placed some very heavy loads upon the
car of science. In his "Fragments of Sci
ence, Vol. II," he says, "There is no cre
ative enerpy whatever in the vegetable or
animal organism." Here Tyndall was
wrong. There is a creative energy which
works intelligently in the vegetable and
animal organism, as is proved by nature's
powÂ»-r to repair injuries. An injury to an
organ is always repaired as far as possible
â¢iccording to the original plan of that
organ, never according to some other
plan.
Just now it is dawning upon the minds
of studious men that in all of the phenom
ena of material life there is a something
which possesses more than a chance relajj
tionship; a something that is not ex
plained by the assumption of "coinci
dence," and that something is vibration.
We find in light seven colors, based
upon the primaries. In sound we find
seven notes, forming a scale that is based
upon three primary tones. In the case of
light the different hues are fixed by the
rate of their vibrations. In the case of
sound the tones are also fixed by the
rate of their vibrations. The science of
petrologyâ the science of rocks â teaches
that different rocks are distinguisbed by
the differences in the arrangement of the
crystals forming rock. And here again
we find the arrangement of the seven
based on the triad.
As yet, mankind is only upon the thresh
old of what is known as electricity. That
wonderful something which, for want of
a better term, we call electrical energy,
who has seen it? Who knows what it
actually is? Recently there has come upon
thÂ« world a few men whose minds, un
trammeled by dogmatic teachings, have
felt the touch of truth, and boldly reach
ing out have grasped some little knowl
edge of the universal power. Tesla has
partly opened the gate. He has harnessed
a few of the vibrating waves of light, and
the so-called "scientific world" stands
awe-stricken as it witnesses the marvelous
demonstrations of his labors. He draws
from the ambient air a flaming crown,
lights his workshop with the luminosity
of sunlight, without wires; charges the
human body with a current of a million of
volts intensity, in utter defiance of all pre
conceived ideas; and applying his knowl
edge to practice produces the most perfect
electro-motor and dynamo known to elec
trical science. The rotary field dynamo
devised by Nicola Tesla has revolution
ized the construction of electrical power
mechanism.
Each and all of Tesla's experiments and
inventions are based upon a recognition
ot the fundamental power of vibration.
The few simple illustrations supplied by
men like Tesla serve to call attention to
the great truth that all matter rents upon
a common basis, wijich is vibration. The
difference between the nebulae in the con
stellation of Orion and the paper yon are
now reading i* simply a difference in the
rate of vibration of the two objects. It
was a theory, it is to-day a theory, sup
ported by some old-view physicists, that
the interstellar space was occupied by
an indefinable, unexplainable substance
called "ether." The fact is that interstel
lar space is filled with matter â hydrogen,
oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and their com
pounds, besides solid material in the shape
of dust. The so-called elements are doubt
less in a highly rarefied gaseous condition.
They are in constant motion â constantly
vibrating. Each sun of the universe ex
ercises its magnetic attraction upon the
matter of space, causing it to flow to them
at their poles, changing its rate of vibra
tion to that of heat, and then again re
turning it from their equators to the great
cosmic reservoir. There cannot ever be a
"death of the sun" in the sense of what
we term "death," statements of wise men
like Newcomb et aL to the contrary not
withstanding. Throughout all that por
tion of the universe understandablo by hu
man sense there is unceasing vibration.
in the phenomena of human life the
power of vibration is very plain. The
sphygmograph is an instrument by which
the beat of the pnlse may be recorded in a
tracing of wavy lines upon a moving strip
of paper. The serrated, wavy line is dif
ferent with different individuals. It shows
the rate of the arterial vibration. Attach
the sphygmograph to the wrist of a person
and allow the person to go to sleep. The
tracings upon the paper appear regular
and characteristic oi the subject. But
while the subject is sleeping allow another
person to clasp hold of the subject's arm
and at on cc the sphygmograph exhibits
evidence of the interjected vibration. The
character of the recorded line is changed,
and if the vibratory force of the intruder
be strongest the record will be of that
rate, to the extinguishment of the lesser.
Slowly but surely the higher intellects
are grasping the knowledge of vibratory
force. Necessarily the advance in appli
cation must be slow, but as the knowledge
progresses more Teslas will appear, and
the coming age will witness the utiliza
tion to the ends of mechanics. Then wiii
it be that the triad of dimensional space
will broaden into the understanding of the
other dimensions based upon the familiar
three of depth, breadth and length, just
as the multi-colors of the spectrum are
bora of the red, yellow and blue.

It is to be a cotillon and Mr. Greenway will
lead alone. The club is in a mc-t prosperous
condition and boasts o; some 150 members.
All this season's debutantes, as well as a
number of Oakland debutantes, will attend
the first meeting. Among the popular belles
and pretty debutantes who will be present
are: The Misses Kip. Miss Wallace, Miss Goad,
Miss Wagner. Miss Salisbury, Miss Joi-selyn,
Miss Hopkins, Miss McNutt, the Misses Hager,
Miss Baldwin, the Misses Smith, Miss Noon,
Miss Selby, Miss Glascock, Miss Van Ness, Miss
Tompkins and Miss Smedberg.
Miss Daisy Van Ness gave a small tea on
Wednesday last in honor of Miss Hamilton of
Santa Monica. It was a young girls' tea and
about twenty-five invitations were issued for
the occasion.
On Tuesday evening Mr. Wiltsee pave a large
theater party at the Baldwin, which was
followed by a supper at the University Club.
Mr. and Mrs. Leysayth of Sydney, Australia,
gave a luncheon on Saturday last at the Occi
dental Hotel, previous to returning to their
Australian home. Covers were laid for twenty
and an elaborate menu discussed. Among'the
guests were Count and Countess Bozenta
(Mme. Modjeska) and Dr. Bahr. During their
stay in this City Mr. aud Mrs. Leysayth were
entertained by Mr. and Mrs. J. U. Jewett and
Dr. and Mrs. Pawlicki.
On Monday, the 19 th, will be celebrated the
nuptials of Miss Millie Flyun, daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. J. C. Flynn, and Fran* L. Wratten.
The ceremony will take place at 9 o'clock at
the residence of the bride's parents on Tweltth
street.
Miss Flynn is widely known in musical cir
cles. She is the soprano soioist at Trinity
Church aud also forms one of the quartet choir
at the Tnylor-etreet Synagogue. She was edu
cated in ihe public schools of the City and is a
pupil ot Professor H. J. Stewart. Her voice is
a remarkably high soprano, sweet and very
flexible, and is especially adapted for church
work.
The wedding is to be a very quiet one, Invi
tations being limited to relatives and intimate
friends oniy. Rev. Mr. Rader oi the
Third Congregational Church will perform the
ceremony. Miss Miriam Corey is to be the
maid oi honor and Miss Leo Wefelsburg and
Miss Juliette Greuinger the bridesmaids. James
Maddocks will be best man.
Mrs. George C Boardman will give a tea on
Saturday, the 31st, complimentary to Mr. and

Major and Mrs. Darling have left the Presidio
and taken apartments at a downtown hotel,
where they'witl remain until they leave for
Angel Island, to which post Major Darling has
been as.igned. Although making their home
on the island, Major and Mrs. Dcning will
spend considerable time on this side the bay.
Mrs. W. H. Mills ot iiÂ»00 Jackson street gave
the first oi a series of receptions last Thursday
evening. Frank Lincoln entertained the com

vited a large number of friends to meet Frank
Lincoln, who during the eveningpentertained
the company with several musical and hu
morous society monologues.
Strictly speaking the October days have
closed the season at the Hotel del Monte, but
the many guests who are now at this popular
resort find the place none the less delightful.
The baths closed for the season last week and
at first left a vacency. but the people are grad
ually learning to fill the usual swimnilng hour
from 11 to 12 o'clock in the morning with
various other amusements, horseback riding
and bowling seeming to have the preference.
Wheeling and driving are of course well to the
fore in the estimation of every one, but seem
ingly horseback riding is more universally
the idea of happiness upon these sun
shiny autumn days. There are also a few
pedestrians amoug the guests, who delight in
an all-day ramble among the woody hills there
abouts, but this species of exercise does not
appear to gain many disciples.
Among the prominent families who arrived
during the past week are the J. E. Magoovens

John T. Mitchell, the father of duplicate
whist, in a recent article on the discard in the
Times-Herald of Chicago, answers a question
that we have been asked several times of late,
"What is the Tormey discard?" Mr. Mitchell,
after explaining several other discards, pays:
There Is the Tormey discard, which waÂ« fully
explained in Whist of January, 1895. This is
a one-card signal, the idea of which was taken
from a Mexican game. The suits are consid
ered as following each other in a certain order,
as spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds, etc., and
the discard of a cardol any suit shows strength
In the suit next following. A spade discard
means strength in hearts, a heart discard
â¢trength in club 6, a club discard strength in
diamonds and a diamond discard strength in
spades.
As you cannot discard a trump you have to
leave the trump suit out of the reckoning, so
that if si.ades were trumps the order ol the
suits would be hearts, clubs, diamonds, hearts;
if hearts were trumps the order would be
spades, clubs, diamonds, spades, and so on.
This discard was frowned upon by Whist, but
It had its followers at the last congress, and as
It proclaims both weakness and strength in
unequivocal terms it id certainly entitled to
respectful consideration. Y. J. Tormey of ban
Francisco, one of the directors of the Amer.ican
Whist League, who was responsible tor its
introduction, modestly said at the time:
"Whether it is good or bad whist play I leave
It to better judges than myself to adjudicate."

Score: North and South 6, East and West 7.
Mr. Hamilton's comments are as follows:
Trick 1. The scoreâ 6 to love â invited finesse.
The game was so tar away that it looked as
ihough it could be only bagged by a "long
shot," and North started oat to make the
spades, and leads low, although holding ace
and five email.
Trick 2. The score would seem to justify
North In starting tne trumps. Holding four,
twohonorn.lt is lmoroaable that either East
or West Iscal'ing, and if not the* South must
have led from six spades. South, ot course,
passes tne heart 8.
Trick 5. North's refusal to play the ace here
is thy clever point to the hand. It is true that
it is about an even tbi ,g that the play will
lose the trick, but North guesse l that the
queen was In East's hand, and tt there the
play of the ace would lose three tricks âif
Youth's kings did not serve as re-entry. North
iÂ» marked with the spade 4, and the long
trump, and South must make his spades if he
holds up the ace.
Trick 6. East leads to West's declared suit.

Fellow, and the groom the son of A. W.Thomp

SURPRISE PARTIES.
Ydung and Old Enjoy This Pleas-
ant Form of Entertainment.
AT the residence of Captain R. J. Murphy
last Monday a host of old friends planned
a dK>st successful surprise party to Miss
Martha E. Farmer, a sister to Mrs. R. J.
Murphy. All kinds of games, singing and
dancing were indulged in until a late hour.
A very enjoyable surprise party was
given to Miss Annie McCurdy at her home.
1238 Mission street, on Saturday, October 10.
Those present were: Professor 8. Hopecraft,

Sunday evening, October 11, Leopold Levy
of Oakland was tendered a surprise party, the
occasion being his twenty-first birth Jay. It

king of clubs.
As the cards were distributed, neither of
Souths kings will serve as cards of re-entry,
and if South plays ace of spades at trick 5 he
loses three tricksâ if East is awake, as the fol
lowing play illustrates.
OVERPLAY.
If South piays ace of spudes, trick 5, then at
trick 10 East can read that South must hold
three spades and one diamond, and he must
play the ace of dinmondg second handâ to
make su r e of shutting out Souths spades, and
both of North's kings falL
EDITORIAL COMMENT!
This is another practical illustration of the
lead we have been advocating for several
years, viz.: the fourth best from ace and four
or five smulL We contend it is trick winning
to always open (being the original leader) a
suit containing ace and four or five others,
even holding the queen or Jack (not both), re
gardless of trump strength with the fourth
best.
NeW Edition of Hamilton.
â¢â¢Modern Scientific Whist," by C. D. P. Ham
ilton, is the best treatise on the game that ever
came from the press. We don't agree with
everything Hamilton says in his book, but
every whlst-wnter in the country ahould urge
all students of the game to get it, and care
fully read it This second edition covers a
good many points of great interest that were
overlooked in the first. Mr. Hamilton dim ma
tes all "fads," such as "short-suitism," etc.,
but he has some of -the most novel ideas of il
lustrating hands, printing them in colors to
facilitate the beginner. We will have more to
say on this subject at another time.
Tormey's 14 Rule.

ated Foster's 11 rule into a formula which |
makes it much easier of explanation to be
ginners, because the reasoning is so apparent.
"The ace being counted high in whist makes
the denominations of the cards run from 2 to
14. When a player leads fourth best he re
mains with three higher cards in his hand,
and adding these to the denomination and
substracting the sum from 14 gives the nura-
Dor oi high cards originally held by the other
players. For example: A player leads an 8.;
he holds three higher cards, which makes the
sum 11, and this taken from 14 gives 3, which
is the number of high cards in the suit held by
the other players."
Whvj Not Glubs AlWavjs Trumps?
Some years ago the American Whist League
adopted the ace of clubs as its emblem. Why
not adopt clubs as the universal trump suit in
all duplicate whist games ? A great many
things can be said in its favor and a few things
can be said against it.
Four challenges are now pending for the
Hideout trophyâ Petaluma Club, Trtst Dupli
cate Whist -club, San Francisco Whist Club and
Oakland Whist Club.
The whist editor of The Call is now visiting
the whist clubs of Portland, Or. From there
he will go to Seattle and Tacoma and see what
is going on in the whist world on Puget Sound.

The short-suit whist fad that has bean tour
ing the country for several years- has just
â  truck San Francisco and Oakland. Like all
new things with those that play at the game,
it is picked up, played for a while and forgot
ten. Like the one-card trump call that was
supposed to be burled long ago; but it got its
head above ground in the Hideout trophy
matchâ Oakland vs. Vallejoâ and was the
chief cause of the Oaklasds losing the match.
The Trist Duplicate Whist Club will soon
issue a system of whist p. ay for the guidance
of all players in the club, and the system will
be presented to the American Whint League for
its consideration. The system will take in the
leads and follows, second, third and fourth
hand play, the discard, the change of suit, the
call for trumps and all other plays that are
not down in tne textbooks. They will be gent

Biography of
Lawrence E. Myers
On July 12 Myers ran 600 yards in
1 :1S 2-5. Although this was not as fast as
his American record of two years before,
1:11 2-5, yet it must be recollected that it
was done on a grass course, which is some
seconds slower than cinders. On July 19
he ran 1000 yards in 2:14 1-5, or 115
seconds behind his great perform
ance described in a former letter,
but nevertheless sufficiently great to
â¢tand on tbe English record books
unbeaten to this day. July 28 he ran 600
yards in 1:13. Although 1 2-5 seconds be
hind his American record it nevertheless
equaled the best professional record ex
tant, and remained the best amateur
record in England for five years, notwith
standing the frequent attacks upon it
On October 18 Myers ran.l2o yards in 12 1-5
seconds. This closed his performances of
consequence for the year.
Next year Myers went to England
again. On July 23 he ran 440 yards, and
tbe circumstances were almost exactly
similar to his first great performance
mentioned at length in my rirst letter on
this runner. An English paper says:
"The quarter-mile path was in capital
order, and it is just possible that
Myers would have given the rec
ord a shaking but for an accident
to his right shoe, which came almost in
twain soon after the start. Under the cir
cumstances, Myers' performance must
rank as one of the most wonderful this
unequaled pedestrian has accomplished.
He went after his men in rare style, and
though he burst bis shoe, he got among
bis men after going 300 yards, and then
Lawrence E. Myers, the Famous
Runner.
sailing down the stretch, won by fifteen
yards." Time, 49 1-5 seconds.
In 1879, when the record-beater ran this
distance in tne best on record for an ama
teur, he covered the distance in 49 1-5 and
lost his shoe ninety yards from home.
On October 3, 1885, Myers made his last
notable aDpearar.ce as an amateur. It
was the occasion of the Olympic Athletic
Club's annual games in New York. I
-would like to give the details of that won
derful effort, but space forbids. There
were sixteen starters in the handicap, and
wnen Myers stepped out on the track
there were many who thought that the
champion had already seen his best days.
However, he started out with that long,
swinging stride that had won so many
races and beaten so many records. The
quarter-mile was passed in 55 seconds, and
then he began overhauling the back-start
men. Entering the homestretch, no one
could get the least idea what was going on,
for the champion was mixed up among a
dozen. Suddenly, from out the motley
crowd of assorted costumes the white uni
form of the champion burst like the dawn.
He only won by a foot, and the time was
1:55 2-5, equaling his own best record in
the world, accomplished in England the
year before. For the benefit of those who
are curious to know how the amateurs of
the present day compare with the cham
pions of the last generation of athletes I will
quote from the Spirit of the Times con
cerning the running of Kilpatrick, who
ran half a mile in 1 :53 2-5 one year ago.
It speaks of Hollister, winner of the inter
co:legiate half-mile run this sprin. :
"Hollister was first to run a great race,
but had no opportunity. His opponents
started off so slowly that he was compelled
to take the lead at once and never lost it,
trotting home an easy winner. C. H.
Kilpatrick, the only man in America
that can make Hollister run, was debarred
from this meeting on account of improper
entry by his college last year, but ran the
same afternoon on a path of the same size,
and won in 1:56 2-5. This is two- fifths of
a second faster than Hollister's time, but
it must be remembered that Hollister led
all the way, and practically alone, while
Kilpatrick started at scratch in a handi
cap and was compelled to run out to catch
the leaders.
The next year Myers entered the pro
fessional ranks. His motive for this was
probably on two accounts: First, be had
spent a great deal of time and money in
athletics, and although accused of being
a sub-rosa professional, was acquitted of
the charges and honorably exonerated
1 before a court of inquiry of the old Na
tional Association, at which sittings I
I was present. Second, he was anxious to
wipe out some old scores with W. C.
George, who had also turned professional.
It will be remembered that George iiad
beaten him in a three-quarter and a one
mile run, which had made the champion
middle-distance runner of the world feel
humiliated.
At any rate, a series of races were arranged
to take place at Madison-square Garden,
New York. Three races were planned
and I do not recall exactly what they
wereâ l think a thousand-yard, a three
quarter and a mile. At any rate, Myers
won tbe first of the series amid tremen
dons excitement, on the old sawdust
track, an eighth of a mile around â the
straights about sixty yards long and the
curves about fifty yards around, though I
think perhaps they were even smaller
than this.
Concerning the mile run I will briefly
say that Georee as usual forced the pace,
Myers lying behind until about 175 yards
from home, when to the astonishment of
his friends and the multitude he dashed
past the great mile runner, whose record
was 4:18 25. George responded feebly,
but when the last curve was reached Myers
had a decided advantage, and being more
accustomed to sharp curves held his own
until the entrance to the homestretch,
then he let out once more and came in a
winner by five or six yards.
The time was 4:32, and when one con
siders the consistency and shape of the
track, and the fact that tbe race was run
in the winter time, when neither had
proper opportunities to train, the time
was fully up to the standard. At any rate
it demonstrates the ability of Myers as a
mile runner, but particularly as an all
round runner. This was his last per
formance of any consequence.
I will now give a resume of bis best per
formances:
50 yards, s)4 seconds; 60 yards, 62-5 sec
onds, both on a sawdust track in the dead
of winter. These remain the best on
record; 75 yards, 7Ji, under the same cir
cumstances. For a lone time this re
mained equal to the best. Tne record
just made by Wefers is 7 2-5, in the sum
mer and trained specially for it.
100 yards, two heats in 10 seconds; 120
yards, 12 seconds; 130 yards, 13%, this
was in a 400-yard run and around a sharp
curve. The present rocord for 100 yards is
9 4-5, by a man who seldom runs over
300 yards. Myers' time for 120 yards is
the best in America. The English ama
teur record is, 11 3-5.
200 yards, 2Qy & on a curveâ The Ameri
can record is 20 seconds, made on a
straightaway; English record is 19 4-5.
220 yards, 22% on a curve, slowing up on
tne last ten yards â American amateur
record, 21 1-5; E nglish record, 21 4-5.
250 yards, 26 seconds, in a 400-yard run,
on an eight-lap track. World's amateur
record 24 3-5, American 25 4-5. 300 yards,
31%. in a quarter-mile run, on a cold,
chilly day. Wefers has just run 300 yards
only, in 31 seconds. The English record
is 31 2-5. Hutchens, the English profes
sional, has run it in 30 seconds.
350 yards, 36 4-5, best on record in the
world. The best English record is by an
American, and is 37 3-5. 400 yards, 43%,
on an eight-lap track. When Downs ran a
quarter mile five feet short in 47 2-5 he
passed the 400-yard mark In 43 seconds, the
course being a straightaway.
440 yards, 48 3-5 seconds. The profes
sional record is 48^; the amateur record,
the record of the world, is 47%, i made on a
straightaway, while Myers' was made on
a circular path. The English record is
48%.
500 yards, 58 seconds, record of the world.
600 yards, 1:11 2-5, record of the world,
equaled by Downs of America and Bredin
of England. 700 yards, 1:31. The record
of the world is 1:29. 800 yards, 1:44 2-5,
record of the world.
Half mile, 1:55 2-5. The best record in
the world is by an American amateur,
1:53 2:5; English record, 1:54 2-5. 1000
yards. 2:13, best record in the world; Eng
lish, 2:154-5. Three-quarters of a mile,
3:13 (this performance has been men
tioned). The best on record in tne world
is 3:02 2-5, by an amateur, under the most
favorable circumstances.
One-mile run, 4:27 3-5, walking the last
ten yards. The record of tne world is
4:12%, made by George, who, the winter
before, was beaten by Myers. One-sixth
of a mile, hurdle race, over ten hurdles, 2
feet 6 inches hieh, 37%. This remains
the best on record in the world.
No man on earth has ever held so
many records, and I do not know of any
man who could make such an assortment
of times and distances. Wefers seldom
runs over 3CO yards, and has beaten Myers'
time three-eighths of a secona for that.
Kilpatrick never runs less than a quarter,
and I have not heard that he has beated
50 seconds. Altogether I think I have
cited enough evidence to assure my read
ers that L. E. Myers was the greatest all
round runner tnat ever lived.

INJURED BY A QUAIL.
ATTORNEY GEORGE LEVINSKY of
**â¢ the Stockton legal firm of Levinsky
& Young was the victim recently of as
strange an accident as ever befell a mem
ber of the bar.
Mr. Levinsky is the attorney for tbe
new Corral Hollow Railroad, which was
built to convey coal from the immense
Treadwell deposits, near Livermore, to
Stockton, and during tne recent visit of
the Native Sons to Stockton he concluded
to take a party over the line to show them
tue beauties of the scenery and the en
gineering difficulties that had to be over
come to construct it.
He had a number of flatcars fitted up for
seats for his guests, and one of the new
engines of the road was hitched to the
train and the party went bowling merrily
through the hills and valleys toward tbe
mines.
The wild game of tne country traversed
by the line has not yet become accustomed
to the shrieking whistle of the locomotive
and the engineer's signal for "down
brakes" is often the cause of a wild stam
pede of both feathered and four-footed
denizens of the woods.
As the excursion train rounded a curve
and signaled a crossing a bevy of quails,
aroused from its feeding ground by the
noisy engine, rose in a body and, bewil
dered by the dust and rattle made by tho
train, flew straight at it instead of away.
They reached it just as the car containing
Mr. Levinsky and several others was pass
ing, and several of the passengers, moved
by a sudden impulse, arose and waved
their arms at the birds. One frightened
quail flew straight at Mr. Levinsky and
struck him fairly in the eye, falling to the
floor of the car as dead us though he had
Deen reached by a charge of shot. Mr.
Levin.tky's eye was severely bruised by
tne blow, and by the time the party re
turned to Stockton was so painful that he
was compelled to have it treated by a phy
sician.

We are always in fear of desolation, as
the pageant of life rolls by, carrying away
from us friends, possessions, joys and
evÂ»n our most cherished idols; but time
refills all thÂ»- vacant places, and we find to
our surprise the pan^s of parting, in mak
ing us more tender, have fitted us for new
and greater Happiness. Earth still reveals
a smiling fnc. Like a kindly mother, she
leads her children from their buried past,
and shows them that by turning from one
experience they do but open the door into
another.
Nature is never bankrupt, though her
stores may be swept away. In her power
to reproduce there is always a guarantee
of riclios. Fire may consume her forests,
floods may devas;ate her fields, disease
may carry away her creatures. Out of her
very loss she will enrich fields for a grander
harvest. And so the world is always full.
It seems empty to us when we have iden
tified ourselves with those belongings, and
not with the wider scope of life. We have
bound ourselves to tne perishable forms of
things; hence feel we have nothing when
these forms disappear.
In this we are less wise than children,
who look forward to change. They enter
heartily into the spirit of play, enjoy their
hoops, their kites, their dolls, but dream
of the grown-up stage, when they will do

different things. Ihey know that for
them life is an unfolding. They are taught
to prepare for new conditions. Parents
ana teachers place before them an ideal
of accomplishment which involves the
giving up of their childish pleasures to ac
cept work instead. They do not under
stand tbe full meaning of this change, it
is true, but they realize that it brings
added freedom and dignity. They feel
witn pride that it is a promotion. No
doubt of this arises in their minds because
the various stages of development are visi
ble abouc them. Therefore, as the years
advance, they resign willingly one aiter
another of these delights as they grow
into the staturo which fits them for new
occupations.
Could we only keep this hopeful outlook
as the years increase losses would no
longer overwhelm us. We, too, would be
prepared for change. Instead of regard
ing it as a hideous specter to which we
must keep our eyes closed as long as pos
sible, we would see in it simply transition
into inevitable spheres of experience.
Pain and effort would still remain, but
they would take on a new meaning. Like
the lessons of our childhood, that pre
pared us for the freedom and responsibili
t es of adult life, losses and labor would
be seen to be a discipline without which
no character could rise above dependence
upon pleasure.

folded in a life of sensuous ease than a
rugged oak could be developed in a hot
house. Each must breast the storm and
bear assaults from frost to mature its
hardier qualities. In no other way can
character gain that strength and stability
which are needed at the threshold of every
advance into greater freedom and power.
Wnile we know this to be a fact we
shrink from the discipline of life because
we are not sure that it does upbuild us.
We are conscious only of the sting. Cling
ing to friends and possessions as they slip
away we have no eyes for the wider view
opening before us. Yet who, after years
nave passed, can look back upon such ex
periences without realizing the good that
has iollowod ? Who has not felt the deep
ening of peace, the calming of restless*
desire?
Perhaps what we neea then is simply to
believe that there are, in the new condi
tion, possibilities of as muc:i content as
we found in the old. Then we would
cease to turn dim eyes upon the past, lift
ing a fearless glance to coming years. Our
mourning for the dead would become an
inspiration to life, an incentive to kindly
deeds. Our privations would appear as
helpful urgings that spur the nature to
more swift unfoldment of its powers. No
longer fearing to go onward we would
hope and strive and gather riches as be
fore.

comes frequently to those who find their
old beliefs undermined. It is like tearing
out their lives to sever thought from
some cherished creed of life or of
religion. They, too, believe that out
side the life they have known lies
only the bitterness of loss. Like drown
ing men to a plank, they clinic to a familiar
form in the firm persuasion that it is es
sential to any valuable experience. Yet,
when the anguish of parting from that
idea is over, we not infrequently find
them clinging quite as passionately to an
otner, or sometimes happy to be free to
look abroad upon opinions without bias.
Nations also struggle michtily to avoid
a change. To the popular mind an
altered custom is a disaster. No com
pensating advantage, however evident, is
sufficient to easily persuade the people to
abandon old usage. They cannot put
themselves mentally in the new position,
so are not able to make it assume the
reality of established order.
This natural conservatism of the mind
is valuable as a guarantee of stability. It
affords to a peopie the necessary time for
development of their special gifts and
thoughts. Only when it becomes a crys
tallization which resists growth is it to De
deplored. But the tendency to do this is
so strong that it nearly always requires
strenuous efforts to break the bonds and
set free again the minds of men. It is the
same doubt of nature, the same fear that

outside the familiar round of life there lies
only negation.
A vivid imagination is needed to picture
to mental sight an untried" experience.
Those who do clearly discern the things
that are to be marvel at the blind oppo
sition of others, that often looks like mere
perversity. But one who observes mental
processes knows that mind cannot be
coerced ; that it is not possible to adopt'
an idea unless previous ideas have led up
to it. He is, therefore, patient. He will
try to lead minds onward. He will strive
by argument and by persuasion to con
vince them that greater good will follow
the abandonment of present conditions.
He can, however, do nothing more than
speed tbe gradual unfold ment.
Nor can any of us do more than this for.
ourselves. Even when we recognize the
fact we are not aDle to overstep it. Ex
perience proves to us that nature leads
ever into widening spheres. Reason as
sures us that to press forward means gain,
not loss. But until we are ready we sit
like chicks within a shell, waiting for tbe
inspiration to crack it and leaves its con
fines forever. What we can do for our
selves is to reflect that there must be a
world beyond it, so gathering courage to
go forth. We can cultivate reliance upon
nature's power to compensate U3 for all
that we leave behind. Moreover, we can
desire to fulfill the destiny of constant
progression. Mebcie M. Thihds.

THE CALL SPEAKS FOR ALL.
Patriotism, Protection
and Prosperity.
FOR PRESIDENTâ
WILLIAM McKINLEY, or Ohio
FOB VICF-PRESIDENT-
GARRE'f A. HOBART, or New Jersey
Election November 3, J896.
Prices are on the jump.
The rural roostei has a right to crow.
The farmer will soon be able to make us
all rich.
There is nothing like leather, and it is
going up.
Wheat is rising of itself, but Bryan can
not get a move on silver.
Prosperity is simply waitine for protec
tion to open the door to her.
Tbe Bryanites are whistling more
loudly than ever, for the graveyard is in
Bight. t
The end is near at hand. Tom Watson's
throat is ulcerated and Bryan is getting
hoarse.
Business grows better every day, for all
the world is sure McKinley will be
elected.
A fluct aating currency would benefit the
money speculators, but it would benefit no
one else.
We are moving right along to prosperity.
Prices are rising and industry has its face
to the sunlight.
California has a glorious opportunity for
advancement and surely her people will
be wise enough to profit by it.
Now that money is coming into tbe
State let us see that we do not send it
abroad again for foreign goods.
Democracy and Populism both talk of
free silver, but one is reaching for free
trade and the other for fiat money.
Protection mows no sections. It ap
plies to north and south, to east and west,
and carries its benefits to tbe industries of
all.
The Indian market for wheat is good,
but the home market is best It will stay
with the farmer provided the farmer stays
with it.
We can never get the deficit out of the
treasury or hard times out of the country
until we get Democracy out of the Gov
ernment.
Don't forget the element of personal in
fluence in politics. You can help the
cause of protection and sound money if
you assert yourself.
Protection will be perfect when it be
comes so universal as to embrace all
American industries, and the Republican
party will make it so.
Bryan, the free-trader, has never been
the friend of any American industry, and
is, therefore, hostile to the interests of ail
who live by those industries.
Study the effect, of free trade on the
wool and the lumber industries of Califor
nia and then decide whether it is worth
while to have free Bilver at the cost of free
trade.
Sound money in circulation, sound
business in all the channels of trade and
sound men in office are among the bene
fits a Republican victory will give the
country.
So long as American work is done abroad
and American labor is unemployed we
shall always have discontent among the
people, and that never fails to result in
discord and strife.
A good Republican majority in San
Francisco will make California safe for
McKinley and to that end all friends of
American industry should work together
and work with zeal.
The revival of industry, tbe develop
ment of resources and the expansion of
commerce are surely things that every
man should vot9 for, and you will rote for
them all when you vote tbe .Republican
ticket.
America has no wortnier citizen or truer
representative of her manhood than Wil
liam McKiuley, the soldier boy, the pa
triot statesman, and the people will vote
for him because they honor his character
as well as believe in his platform.
It appears that just before his nomina
tion for the Presidency Bryan tried to get
a place as an advertising agent of a the
atrical company and it also appears that
having failed in that he has sought conso
lation in making a circus of himself.
The Democratic candidates for the Leg
islature who took the Non-Partisan pledge
and now declare they will not stand by it
are not widely different from other fusion
politicians. The only way to get straight
men in office is to stick to straight politics
and beware of combinations.
BISING FRICES.
The prospects of California have not been
brighter in a quarter of a century than
they are to-day. We ssera to be upon the
! verge of a new boom, using that wor>i to
signify not specnlation but the realization
of a degree of prosperity which will be in
striking contrast to the depression of tbe
last three years.
The conditions of the rural industries of
| the State are good and the prospects of
improvement are exceptionally bright.
All tbe great staple products with tUe
I sole exception of hops are advancing.
Raisins, which iRHt year went begging at
from 2 to 3 cents per pound, are now in
demand at from 4 to 5 cents. Wheat,
which several months ago ?old for 90 cents
per cental, is worth to-day $1 45 and some
sales were made yesterday at $1 50. Tbe
price ofleather has advanced 3 cents per
pound in the Eastern market and while
the advance here has been only 1 cent it
is but a Question of time when the Cali
fornia market will follow that of the East
and a iurther improvement will be made.
The rise in the price of wheat entails a
corresponding rise la the prices of all
cram crops. Corn, rye, oats and barley
follow wheat in its upward movement.
All the commercial products of these
grains will, of course, rise also. The price
o! flour has been already advanced $1 in
this City. The effect of this upon the
rural industries ol the State will be in the
highest decree beneficial and a corre
sponding benefit will follow to the manu
facturers inasmuch as the farmers will
now be better able to purchase manufac
tured goods and the consumption of all
classes of articles will largely increase.
As all industries are affected more or
less by the conditions of the farming in
dustry, it is a foregone conclusion that
business in all the channels of trade will
be improved. Banks, which have hesitated
to lend money to farmers on a falling
wheat maiKet, will now be willing to maue
loans easy, since it is clear that the farmer
will be able to repay them. Tnus, with a
rising market for farm products there will
be an easier money market and a larger
circulation of money In the cities. Out of
this there cannot fail to come benefits to
retail traders as well a 9 to the great
producers, and the entire commercial sit
uation as well as the industrial will soon
show signs of a prosperity such as we have
not known for a long time.
Every citizen can draw the moral from
this condition of affairs. The rise in
wheat, it is true, has been occasioned not
so much by what has happened here as by
the failure of the crop in India and the
heavy losses in the Australian harvests.
Nevertheless, the profit which we are to
derive from it will depend largely upon
conditions in tbe United States. If we
continue the present low tariff the money
which we derive from abroad for our farm
products will be sent back again for manu
factured goodd. To secure a permanent
benefit from our present advantage it is,
essential we should return at once to the
protective system. This fact every citizen
should bear in mind and cast his vote in
accordance with it for protection and pros
perity â for McKinley and Hobart.
In 1861 we had gold at a premium
That was the case until 1865. What
'was the effect it had on tbe laboring
man's wages and on the commodities
the laboring man bought? Why, every
one of the commodities went up 132
percent. How much did labor go up?
It went np 48 per cent. Tho conse
quence wag that the laboring man dur
ing these yearn upon an average lost
36 per cent Â«if tho available power and
products of his Jabor. This is a fact,
not something that J say to you, bat
something that you oau flud indisput
ably proved by experience. â Tom Reed.
AFRO-AMERICAN VOTERS.
At the recent session of the Arro-Ameri
can Congress held at Los Angeles a com
mittee of leading members of the Congress
was appointed to draw up an address to
the colored voters of the United States in
general and particularly to those of Cali
fornia. That address has now been issued
and forms one of the notable contribu
tions to the campaign in favor ot sound
money, protection and the Republican
party.
The address points out that under the
free coinage of silver, as proposed by Bry
anites, the wage-earners of the country
would suffer severely, and that as Afro-
Americans are nearly all wage-earners
their interest in this issue ofthe campaign
is of vital importance. It further directs
attention to the fact that the Republican
National platform demands that every
citizen shall be allowed to cast a free
ballot, and that the bailot shall be fairly
counted, thus guaranteeing protection to
the colored voters of the South, ilore
over it denounces the uncivilized and bar
barous practice known as lynching, which
has been too common in the Southern
States, and thug promises to secure to the
colored people their rights to a fair trial
by jury in accord with the established law
of the Republic.
The address is an able one in every re
spect. It^honld be widely circulated and
widely read. In a broad sense it concerns
white as well as colored citizens, and with
great clearness states the reasons why in
this campaign the industrious and law
abiding people in the community should
cast their vote for that party which, as the
address says, "Sanctified by the martyred
blood of Lincoln has ever been foremost
and devoted to the uplifting of the colored
race and the protection of the wage-earner
wherever found who owes allegiance to
our common country and its flag."
Let every man arouse himself and re
member that the duty which lie owes
his Government and his fellow-men Is
this year grave and imperative. Let
him not be misled by false hopes of
gain. Gains that come through the sac
rifice of honor are' not to be hoped for
bat dreaded. And any advantage, how
ever great, reached through an alliance
with force* that are a menace to good
government will prove som> time to
httve been dearly bought.â Hon. F. J.
Black.
ELECTION ESTIMATES.
for some time past various political
experts have been furnishing the country
with forecasts as to the probable outcome
of the election in November. Estimates
coming from persons of more or leas emi
nence have appeared frequently and for the
remainder of the campaign they will
appear with a greater frequency still.
The well-posted citizen, whoso experi
ence with politics covers more than one
Presidential campaign, will not pay much
attention to these estimates. He is aware
that they are usual at this season in elec
tion years and that they signify, even
when they are Bincere, the wish rather
than the real thought of those from whom
they come. The leaders of al! tho parties
will insist their candidates are to be elect
ed, and he Is a poor leader indeed who has
not sufficient ingenuity to furnish figures
which at least seem to justify his confi
dent predictions.
The safest basis on which to estimate
tbe outcome of the election is the align
ment of the people as revealed among
those elements of society which are suf
ficiently prominent to be clearly seen.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1896.
There are no classes in America. There is
comparatively little difference between
tho ceneral thoughts and sentiments of
noted Americans and of ordinary Ameri
cans. The wealthy are generally as much
divided as the poor.. When, therefore, it
is seen that au overwhelming majority of
the more prominent people \a the Nation
are on one side it is very safe to say that a
laree majority of the less notable people
will be on the same side.
Never before in our history have the
more elements of our people
been "so massed on one side as in this
campaign. Hitherto all grades of society
and all professions and trades have been
more or less equally divided between the
two great parties. In this contest, how
ever, almost everybody who is sufric'ently
prominent to be noted is on the side of
McKinley. Nearly all the great news
papers, tbe college professors, manufac
turers, men of business, leadenr-of work
ingmen and even clergymen, who usually
take no part in politics, have declared
themselves in this issue for sound money
and sound morality.
It is almost impossible that Mr. Bryan
should be elected. The elements that are
for him may be noisy in mass-meetings,
but they count for very little in tbe great
mass of the American people. Tne assur
ances of the success of the Republican
ticket are everywhere so strongly felt that
business has already begun to revive.
The price of almost everything is rising
except the price of silver. This furnishes
a basis on which we can salely estimate
what the result will be in November.
Mr. Bryan will be the worst-defeated can
didate that ever ran for the Presidency,
and the vote of the people everywhere
except in the Southern States, where
speciai causes continue to keep tbe Demo
cratic party strong, will be almost unani
mous for McKinley and Hobart.
In some campaigns we had thought
about the industrial interest only, but
to-day the universal welfare of the
American people la at Rtafce. It iÂ« pro
posed not only to assault tlie industrial
but also the financial system which has
hitherto been the bedrock of our policy.
They also propose to make assault upon
the moxt important institution of all,
namely, the constitution of the United
States- I cannot conceive of a worse
piece of wickedness than the policy
proposed, as it is one throughout of
tearing down and destroying with no
attempt to build up. It is considered
and Improperly called a canipaig;n of the
masses, but the only object seems to be
to infuriate them âHon. Hampton L..
(arson of Pennsylvania.
LAW AND ORDER.
Wh ile the groat majority of men have
looked upon the issues of this campaign as
involving merely economic questions tbe
wiser and more far-seeing leaders of the
community have beheld in it a threat made
by the Bryanites against Jaw and order
itself, and they have not hesitated to
point out that in their judgmeut the issue
of social order and peace against anarchy
ami lawlessness is really the most essen
tial point to be considered by the voter in
casting his ballot on election-day.
The men who have been foremost in
presenting this phase of the question to
the people are ex-President Harrison,
ex-Minister Phelps, a lifelong Democrat,
and Archbishop Ireland. The words of
these men cannot fail to have weight with
every reflecting citizen. Mr. Bryan, him
self a hasty and inconsiderate talker, may
not mean all that he says, and many of
tbe peor>le who support him roar be
equally inconsiderate in their words and
actions. Nevertheless, it cannot be ques
tioned that the whole trrnd and tendency
of Bryanism is to excite the feelings of
the discontented against their more pros
perous neighbors and to arouse in this
country those passions which tend to dis
turb ail industries ana the entire social
structure of the people.
Over and over again in his speeches Mr.
Bryan has appealed to the prejudices that
are supposed to exist among the more
ignorant people. Hp has â if not inten
tionally, certainly by his carelessness of
speech â said much to lend the poor to
believe that those who are richer than
themselves are engaged in a conspiracy to
rob, plunder and defraud. In his speeches
in favor of free trade he did not hesitate
to declftre protection to be a system of
plunder and robbery, and now as a Candi
das for the Presidency he is equally ve
hement in declaring the bankers of the
Country are seeking to deprive industry of
its profits and labor of its wages.
If these words do not tend to excite civil
disturbances, to what end do they tend?
What can be the purpose except to enrage
labor against capital and the poor against
the rich. There can be no question that
Mr. Bryan exerts an evil influence upon
the country, that his party has started
upnn a wrong course and must continue
to go from bad to worse bo long as the
people permit it to have any power or
prestige among tiiem.
Tbe peace of the country depends upon
tbe contentment of the people. Where
widespread discontent exists the law itself
is powerless. This issue which Biyan is
forcing upon the people is, beyond ques
tion, the gravest in our politics, and while
in California *re might overlook it, in the
more thickly settled East it has become
the chief topic of the campaign, and many
men who might otherwise have voted for
free silver and even for free trade will re
fuse to vote for a man who stands for riot,
lawlessness and all that tends to anarchy.
THE NON-PARTISAN PLEDGE.
If the nominees of the Citizens' Non-
Partisan party for the State Senate know
no more of the needs of the several dis
tricts from which they were nominated
than they do of the constitution of the
StÃte, they certainly will make but poor
representatives in case of election. They
have signed a pledge in which each indi
vidual asserts: "1 hereby promise that if
I am elected to the Legislature I will, by
my vote and influence, endeavor to secure
the adoption of the new charter in its
entirety and without amendment by ibe
Legislature."
Th*is wos evidently the signing of a
pledge without a knowledge of tbe
provision of the constitution of the
State that declares that if a charter is
adopted by electors it cannot be amended,
but must be adopted or rejected as a
whole. The language is: "It a majority
of such qualified electors voting thereat
shall ratify the same (the charter) it shall
thereafter be submitted to the Legislature
for its approval or rejection as a whole,
without power of alteration or amend
ment"
Never before was there such a combina
tion of the business elements of the coun
try allied against a candidate for the
Presidency as are now arrayed against
Bryan. He may please a good many peo
ple as an orator, but there are very few
who think he is a safe man to intrust with
the management of the affairs of the
Nation.
The American workitigman is still wait
ing for some Bryanite to tell him what
effect free silver, coinage will have on
wages besides cutting their purchasing
power in two.

THE VALUE OF CONFIDENCE
Without It Trade nmt Industry Bait
and the, Horkingtnnn la Without
Occupation.
Boston Commercial Bulletin. -
Confidence may bj an intangible thing, but
without confidence all prosperity is at an end.
The manufacturer, unless reasonably assured
of a market for his good?, will not buy ma
terial and start his mills; the jobber and re
tailer will not stock their stores unless settled
conditions are promised. Without confidence
in future conditions trade and industry halt,
the workingman is without occupation, enter
prise is crushed, development is at a stand
still. How different the situation when confi
dence Is absent, thosummcr of 1896 can testify
to many thousands of our people.
Stability in the meixsure oi value is the first
requisite of prosperity. We can adjust our
seives to an unfavorable tariff, to the natural
ups and downs of existence, if we know that
future values will be measured by the same
standard that exists to-day. In former periods
of the world's history the greatest opponents
of, as well as the greatest sufferers from the
clipping of the coin were the laboring popula
tion. Reducing the value of the legal tender
has always been the resort of despots and op
pressors. It has remained for tiie end of the
nineteenth century to see the argument ad
vanced that cutting the value of the coin is
for tbe benefit of the common people.
Notuutil the election Is known to have re
sulted in the triumph of sound money and
sound principles of government will the in
spiration be given to new enterprise. People
with means at their command will take no
chances where success of an enterprise de
pends upon steady development under even
conditions. Municipalities and corporations
will undertake no new operations until they
can tiorrow capital, to be expended directly or
indirectly for labor, on the reasonable terms
which confidence on the part of lenders In the
stability of the loans will alone enable them to
secure.
BRYAN THEN AND NOW
Wichita Eagle.
It wil^nardly be denied that the Bryan who
was so untiring in his efforts for free trade and
the Wilson bill and who was later the Popu
list editor is maintaining an entirely different
attitude as the nominee of the Chicago con
vention for President. He now pretends
above everything else to be the friend of the
workingman. To go back a little to his rec
ord: Six years ago, in a public address, Wil
liam Jennings Bryan said that the wages of
men who worked in shops were too high, and
he declared that the affairs of this Govern
ment had been controlled too long by such
workmgmen.
Then Will iÃm Jennings Bryan was advocat
ing free trade in the interest of foreign manu
facturers, and he wanted to subject the work
ingmen of this country to ruinous competi
tion with underpaid foreign worklngmery
Two years ago, when William Jenuings
Bryan was a member of the Democratic House
of Representatives, a delegation of glass
workers appeared before the committee on
ways and means, of which Mr. Bryan was a
member, to protest against some of the
schedules of the Democratic free trade tariff
bill. William Jennings Bryan then denounced
those glassworkers, who were all workingmen,
as "public beggars."
William Jennings Bryan voted for that in
famous Democratic tariff bill and it became a
Jaw. The result has Droved most disastrous to
workingmen. Through loss of employment
and wages they have been reduced to a condi
tion bordering upon starvation. The waeres of
men who worked in shops, which Mr. Bryan
thought were too hieh six years ago, have
been reduced and Mr. Brvan helped to reduce
them by voting for the Democratic tariff law.
This is the chort but pointed record of
William Jennings Bryan, who pretends to be
a lriend of the workingmen.

THE PATRIOTIC CAMPAIGN.
New York Sun.
The true character of this campaign and the
appeal which it makes to patriotic Democrats
were well set forth in the letter of the Hon.
Levi Parsons Morton to the Republican
League. "In this campaign," wrote Governor
Morton, "party lines are largely obliterated.
Partisanship is forgotten in the higher pur
pose of maintaining the honor of the Nation."
Not since tho second nomination of Mr. Lin
coln has there been such a merging of party
lines in a spirit oi general patriotism. Demo
crats, whether they have decided to vote for
McKinley and Hobart or whether they intend
to vote for Paimer and Buckner. already de
sire the triumph of the .Republican ticket, not
because it is nominally a Republican ticket,
but because it is the sole defense against dis
honor and tho rnin which would result from
carrying into effect the Chicago platform.
And since the Republican ticket is the sole
defense of the linited States against the
calamities of Bryanism and Altgeldism and
Debsism, it is the duty of every Democrat to
vote for that ticket. It is no year for dress
parades. Patriotism demands that Bryan and
Sewall be not merely beaten, but beaten mon
umentally and beyond all precedent.
POOR BOYS GET TO THE TOP.
From the New York Times.
The hollowness of Bryan's talk about the
down-trodden masses is well illustrated by the
history of several natives of Jefferson County,
this State, who have risen from what are
termed humble beginnings to positions of
wealth, honor and high public esteem. Men
tioning some of these, the Waterton Times
says that the fact was brought out forcibly hy
ex-Governor Flower and others who partici
pated in the public reception to the Hon.
Daniel G. Griffin on his return hone after his
nomination lor Governor by the National
Democratic State Convention "Ex-Governor
Flower, Judge O'Brien, Wilbur F. Porter,
Daniel G. Griffin," says the Times, "in fact,
every man who has attained prominence in
fiublic life, success in business or professional
ife in this locality, has worked his way up
from lowly beginnings and found no obstacles
placed in his way." This is not the country
in winch to talk about classos and masses.
THE ANSWER IS EASY.
Tulare Register.
Tbe Republican contention is to return to a
condition which we louud good for many
years. The Populist contention is to try some
thing which has never worked to the benefit
of any people at any time. The Republicans
say let us be guided by the experience of all
civilization. The Populists say let us try an
old scheme which has been a failure every
where. Which is the sensible and business
like position?

FIFTY-CENT GODSENDS.
New York Press,
I have known men who have not seen any
kind of dollars for so long that a 50-cent dol
lar would be a gods end to them.â W. J. Bryan
at Logansport, Ind.
But why not give them the 100-cent dollar
which they received in 1892 ? Any man who
was willing to work could find employment in
that year, and no one offered him a 50-cent
dollar when a 100-cent dollar was due iiim. for
his labor.
And how about the 7,000,000 men who are
employed in the United Btates to-day? Are we
to give them 50-cent dollars instead ot the
100-cent dollars they now receive, In orcter
that some other people may also get only half
ef what they ought to have? When we can
pay 100-cent dollars to every one, Mr. Bryan,
â w hy compel any one to take 50-cent dollars?

POET, ARTIST, PHILOSOPHER
WHOSE ART WAS FOR HUMANITY
WILLIAM MORRIS was one of the noblest I
and most significant figures oi our
century. By his death the world
has lost a great laborer for art and for
humanity. Years ago, when both were
young men, Dante Gabriel Rossetti called
Morris "the greatest literary identity of
our time," and there seems a peculiar ap
propriateness in his phrase. Morris has in
aeed for the past lorty years been, among
men and letters, & very distinct identity. His
strong individuality pervaded all his work.
Were he writing poems, manufacturing "art
â tuffs," throwing himself heart and soul into
the "Socialistic League," or printing books,
everything he turned his hand to was done
with an earnestness and vigor of purpose
which left on eacn, "William Morris, his
markl"
The news of his death has come with some
thing of a shock to those who thought of him
as invincible in his splendid vitality as one of
his own Norse heroes. He was struck down in
the very prime of life. We had counted upon
his living on well into the twentieth century.
Morris was born near London only sixty-two
years ago. he was an Oxford man and in col
lege during that time when the Pre-Raphaelite
movementâ started In London by Rossettiâ
was making such a stir in the universiy
center. Paul Bourget in his "Outre Mer" ret
marks that the two situations containing the
greatest possibilities of human happiness seem
to bim that of a young Englishman of good
family at Oxford, or an American girl with a
rich and indulgent father! Tne first of these
blissful alternatives was William Morris. He
was in those years a young Oxford man of
good family and easy circumstances. Like
Purne-Jones he was destined for the church.
Both these young men, friends at that time as.
always after, coming under Rossetti's in
fluence were diverted from dogma to art, and
to the larger study of humanity. For those
who ccc in the movement of the "Pre-
Raphaelites" only the desire for a sincerer and
less conventional form of art have failed to
understand its entire significance. Instead,
as has been truly said :
"In humanity itself, with all its possibili
ties; in its triumphs and its degradations, its
labors and its sufferings, they rediscover
'God'â an 'unknown God,' it may be; 'incon
ceivable,' if we will, but evident in tbe quick
ened conscience of a growing world and in the
invincible instincts of human pity and love.
Millais sees a young Christ in the delicate boy
vdth a wounded hand, in the dreary and com
fortless carpenter's shop. Hunt sees a cruci
fied Christ in the tired workman, overtaxed
and despairing amid tbe calm sunlight of
eventide. Rossetti sees a risen Christ in the
noble poet, whose great love could conquer
death and enter upon the new life at the pres
ent hour. The true Pre-Raphaehsm does not
take the halo from the head of the Christ of
history, but it puts the halo upon the headof
every suffering child, of every faithful man
Â»nd woman since the world began."
This was written in direct reference to the
painters and their work. It applies with
tqual truth to other aspects of this "second
renaissance," as it is sometimes called. Any
estimate of the subject which does not take
this Into acccunt is unfair and only partial.
William Morris in his first reaction from
latter-day problems, which, we suspect, even
then began to press heavily upon bim, turned
back to pagan and medieval subjects. Here
told in glowing words Btories of the Greek
gods and Norse heroes of a young world and
the adventures of knights and ladies in that
"middle age" which was at once more sensu
ous, more superstitious and less complete
than our own. His work was infused with the
true Greek love of beauty, and in the preface
to bis "Earthly Paradise" he expressly pro
claimed himself naught but "the idle sinper
of an empty day." In that most exquisite
and musical of all dedications he says:
Dreamer of dreams born out of my doe time;
Why should I try to set the crooked straight?
Let it suffice me that my murmuring rhyme
Beats with light wing against the ivory gate,
Telling a tale not too Importunate.
It is singular to remember that these words
â were written by the man whose whole after
life was devoted to an intense humanitarian
ism, whose "soul was consecrate" in the su
preme etfort "to set the crooked straight."
ThoÂ«e Oxford days were before all this, and
they are good to remember. It was during
Morris' time there that Rosscttl and Burnc-
Jones and Arthur Hughes and some other
ardent but Inexperienced souls engaged in the
great fresco scheme for the Oxford Union De
bating Hall. The young artists gave their
services and the city paid their expenses. Be
ing loftily ignorant of all mere technical
knowledge of fresco work they did their paint
ing on the raw brick wall, with the appalling
result that in a few months' time it was all
soaked in. We are led to suppose, however,
that they were easily consoled for this fiasco,
though the loss to art was a somewhat graver
matter. Rossetti's poor obliterated face of
Guinevere was said to have been one of the
finest things he ever did. But such youth
such high spirits, such joy in lifeâ at the city's
expenseâ were theirs at the time. Morris was
one of this band, though he does not seem
to have taken any active part in the decora
tion. But all together they discussea art, and
life, and great plans for the future over mid
night pipes. It was during this time that they
first saw, in a theater, the lady who afterward
became Mrs. William Morris. She posed for
Rossetti uore than once, and her face can be
recalled by all who are familiar with his "Day
dream."
Morris about this time was greatly interested
In tbe Oxford and Cambridge Magazine. This
was a sort of successor to the Germ, and, like
that Journal, fated to an early death. Morris
contributed to its support with pen and purse
for something more than a year, when it be
came defunct. He wrote delightfully archaic
tales, which found few readers outside of his
own particular circle. The stories are chiefly
Interesting to-day because they indicate
Morris' preference even then for strong and
simple Saxon words, and his delight in the
more picturesque and romantic aspect of past
ages. Morris loved the world when it was
young. His earliest volume of poems, "The
Defense of Guinevere," deals with medieval
legends and tales. In many cases the subjects
are the same as Tennyson's In his "Idyls of Che
King." Yet what a difference is shown in the
treatment Tennyson gives us nineteenth
century problems and ideals in tbe beautiful
guise of these old tale*, while Morris gives us
the real flavor of medievalism. In reading
him one is transported (It is not too strong a
wor<T to a long past age.
Oue feels the freshness, the childlike joy, or
terror or superstition of a simpler time. To
fully perceive this difference one baa only to
i read Morris' "Sir Galahad" and then Tenny
â  ion's. The treatment of the former la largely
1 objective. In his despondency at his failure
\la the (literal) finding of the Holy Grail, the
actual presence of the Savior appears to Sir
Galahad and speaks words of consolation.
Tennyson's conception is entirely subjective.
An exalted state of spirit alone sustains bis
knignt whose 'strength is- as the strength of
ten because his heart Ik pure.'
V. c must adm.il that Morris' method is nearer
akin to the temper of tbe middle ages. This
ability to project himself into the spirit of a
long past Â«ge is one of Morris' most striking
characteristics. It holds true of his next work,
"The Life and Death of Jason," which was
published early in the sixties. Tnis poem
relates the mythical search of the Argonauts
for the golden fleece, and is so long t but few
people have cared to read it through. "The
Earthly Paradise," which came next, is longer
still, being usually published in three vol
umes. Beading it is, however, less of a task
because it consists of twenty-four different
tales, any one of which may properly be read
apart from the rest.
In construction it suggests the "Canterbury
Tales." "Certain gentlemen and mariners" of
Norway set sail to find the earthly paradise, of
which they had heard reports. After passing
through many trials and after the lapse of
many years they come, as . old ; men, to "a
strange Western laud, where they settle and
remain till their death. For the space of a
year they come together twice a month at fes
tivals and at each of these some tale is told.
Many of these stories are extremely beautiful.
The subjects of all are either Greek or Scandi
navian. Many are infused with the true spirit
of Hellenism with its beauty worship and
splendor of narrative. Morris wes several
years in writing the "Earthly Paradise," but
his greatest gift to the mental life of his fel
lows is his presentation in the English tongue
of that great northern myth which is the in
heritance of all English-speaking â¢ people.
Morris accomplished this in his great "Story of
Sleurd, the Voisung. " It is taken not from
the "Nibelungen Lay," as is so often supposed,
but directly from the Norse Sagas, which are
also the source of the German epic. No one
in reading both could fail to be impressed by
the moTe heroic mold in which Morris* ver
sion is cast.
In the "Nibelungen Lay," written early In the
thirteenth century, the strength of the pagan
myth is vitiated by the necessity of conforming
to medieval Christian sentiment. The result
is artificial. The poem is as ornate as a Gothic
cathedral. â â  We have prancing steeds and wav
ing plumes and jangling swords and. gayly at
tired knights and ladies. It Is ail very fine
and very pretty, but beside it "The Story of
Sigurd, the Vo'.sung," looms 'in strong and
simple grandeur, like a god overtowering a
foppish courtier. Beside Morris' "Sigurd" and
"Brynhiid" and "GudriÂ»n." the German "Sieg
fried" and "Brunhild" and "Krienhild" seem
mere puppet?, created to "adorn a tale." The
Euclish poem shows us tbe mighty forces of a
primitive world at work. Those heroic beings
who occupied a place half way between gods
and mortals move forward to a doom as splen
did and as resistless as thatof a Greek tragedy.
There is ( a majesty in the movement which
compels a sort of awe.
*In all great myths the beliefs and the hopes
of a people are personified, and because be
liefs and hopes are forever essentially the
same, changing only in outward aspect as the
life of man changes. So the mighty feeling
which creates the legend is still a living force
in our consciousness to-day. We see in Sigurd
an ideal of a mighty race, a dim forecasting oi
the Christ who was to come. In his first pure
brightness and invincible strength and vow
of eternal faithfulness to Brynhiid, followed
by his draught from the cup of ; forgetf ulness,
we read the perpetual story of the human
heart turned aside from Â«nd losing even the
memory of its earlier ideals. A What " life has
not felt its own unfaithfulness and yearned
dimly, like Sigurd, for an unremembered
good BS9SH
The story of the Voisung was the last great
poem that Morris wrote. From this time his
pen was mostly devoted to his socialist propa
ganda. He wrote "The Dream of John Ball,"
and "News From Nowhere," and "Hopes and
Fears for Art," and some ; stirring verses and
some delightful tales, 7 but ' he did nothing
really great. Like Tolstoi,' be in a measure
sank the artist in the apostle. -. .
Soon after leaving Oxford Morris began his
artistic manufacturing. lie was one of the
most fervent of those , who believed that the
English needed an enlightening gospel in mat
ters of taste. His hope was to stimulate in the
people themselves an artistic sense which
should revolt from overdecoration, or shoddl
ness. "Simplicity" was, his watchword. He
said: "It you cannot learn to love real art
learn to hate sham art and reject it. Learn to
do without." In all his fabrics he would Lave
no imitation. Linen was ' not : made : to look
like silk nor cotton like wool. He recognized
the value ana the beauty of pure cotton stuffs
that were cottony as well a* of pure silks that
were silky. This in itself was no inadequate
way of preaching the gospel of sincerity. Side
by side with his love lor art there was growing
up in his soul the love for humanity. ,
The temper of his mind had become agnos
tic. He was among those who said "I can
not believe, because Ido not know." And this
attitude ' acting upon a naturally noble mind
Induced a passionate desire to make the life,
here | and now, of : his fellow-men > less hard.
"This sorry scheme of things,", he longed, like
the ! old * Persian, to "shatter, It to bits," and
then : "remold it nearer to the heart's de
sire." And 'â¢: so this "idle singer of an empty
day" devoted all the powers of his great heart
and brain to that divine business of shatter
ing and remolding. V: He said : "I do not want
art for a few. I would ; rather see it swept
away from the face of the earth than live such
a poor, thin . life, with . its I apostles despising
those beneath them for an ignorance and bru
tality for ; which they r are themselves respon
sible." :; ; }^:^- - : '. '-'^\: y: 'S'rSl

pie at Merton Abbey. This place, originally
an old Norman abbey, became the famous
Morris iactory, where beautiful fabrics were
made and where handwork superseded the use
of machinery as much as possible.
In his "Dream of John BrII" he painted
a return to medieval methods of workman
ship. There is a rare charm ,in these pictures
of tne past he has given us. They are filled
with a large serenity, a freedom from petty
and artificial demands upon the indi
vidual, a sense of breathing space grateful to
the imagination of a fevered age. His great
desire was to bring back this spirit into mod
ern life. In his "News From Nowhere" he drew
a return in the twentieth century of this
primitive simplicity of life, never remember
ing that
The moving finger writes, and, bavins writ,
llores on . . . !
He had an inextinguishable hopefulness.
Ab, poor Morris; he was so sure he would live
to have his great "cause" triumph aud to Fee
all the present forms of government and all
social and economic evils swept away in Eng
land, and in their stead a simple, healthful,
happy life for all his fellows, such as he had
sketched in his "News From Nowhere." It is
only inâ ''Nowhere," alas! that such dreams

And rejoice in the deeds of his hand,
Nor yet come home lo the even
Too faint and too weary to stand.
Men in that time a-coming
Shall work and have no fear â¢
For to-morrow's lack of earning
And the hunger wolf anear.

That no man then shall be glad
Of his fellow's fall and mishap
To snatch at the work be had.

LITERARY NOTES.
InAppleton's Popular Science Monthly for
October Charles Howard bhinn has a very en
tertaining as well as instructive article on
"Nevada Silver." It is handsomely illustrated,
ana contains much valuable information and
som3 very well told incidents and anecdotes
that are new to the types. The writer has
caught the spirit of the times when "On to
Was hoe" was the cry. There are also some
choice bits of descriptive work in the article,
which is largely historical and entirely fascin
ating to readers old and young alike.
Two more of the neat little Temple edition
volumes of Shakespeare are out, "Cymbeline"
and "Pericles." They are in uniform bind
ing, of course, with all the preceding volumes
of this edition, which is got up in the very
height of the bookbinder's and typographer's
art by Macralllan &. Co., the New York and Lon
don publishers. Each volume contains an
entire play, and each volume will fit very
nicely in one's coat pocket. For sale by Wil
liam Doxey; price 45 cents, bound ia cloth.
A. C. McClurg & Co. have in the press "A
Short History of Italy," by Miss Kirklanrt, and
"Italy In the Nineteenth Century," by Mrs.
Latiraer, uniform with that autnor's series of
popular nineteenth-century histories.
An English edition of the letters of Victor
nugo will bo published by Messrs. Methuen at
the same time as the French one. The trans
lation is being made by F. Clarke, and the first
volume may bo looted for within the next few
months. It contains letters to Hugo's father,
to his young wife, to his confessor, Lamennalg,
an important set to Sainte-Beuve, and letters
about his early books and plays. The com
plete correspondence ranges from Hugo's boy
hood to his deatTt; and nothing has been pub
lished oi it before. .
A volume of British "Songs for Soldiers and
Sailors" is being edited by John Farmer for
Messrs. Cassell oj London. It is meant to be a
representative and comprehensive collection
of all the best English national, naval and
military songs. That means that it will in
clude "Tom Bowling," "Ye Mariners of Eng
land" and "Black-Eyed Susan." Other songs
which will be given are "Lovely Nan," "Bweet
Poll of Plymouth" and "The Topsails Shiver in
the Wind." The military songs will Include
"Primis in Indls," "The Union Brigade" and
"Captain Burnaby."
A story of the time of Shakespeare, written
by John Bennett, win be the leading serial for
the new volume of St. Nicholas. It is called
"Master Skylark," and will deal with the ro
mantic events of the Elizabethan age. The
great dramatist figures as ono of the leading
characters, although the hero and heroine are
a boy and a girl. Another serial, "The Last
Three Soldiers," by William H. Shelton, has a
novel plot. It tells of three Union soldiers
who became veritable castaways, in the Con
federacy. Both stories will begin In the No
vember St. Nicholas.
The selections presented In the "Library of
tbe World's Best Literature" have not only
been approved by such discriminating editors
as Charles Dudley Warner, Professor Mabie,
editor of the Outlook, and other critical
judges, but they have also been passed upon
by an advisory board from the leading Amerl
can universities. This would seem to argue
that the selections are thoroughly lepresenta
tive of different nations and periods. Besides
this the extracts are accompanied and ex
plained by numerous critical and biographical
essays contributed by over 300 distinguished
writers in this country and Europe. The work
is in thirty volumes, the first two of which
will be ready for subscribers October 1.
Mrs. L. T. Meade and "Clifford Halifax,

GEORGE T. CURTIS' CON
STITUTIONAL HISTORY.
1 CONSTITUTION HISTORY OF. THE
UNITKD STATS"-. By c{eort?e Tlcknor Curtis.
Vol. 11. 'Halted by Joseph Culbertson Clayton.
New York: Harper & Broth* publishers. lor
:; tale by A. M. Robertson; price $3. . . , ,
We are pleased to acknowledge the receipt of
the second volume of j Mr. Curtis' monumental
work. V; It is greatly to be regretted that death
should have removed this distinguished histo
rian of the constitution while still this closing
volume S remained unfinished. The first vol
ume of the work, which was duly reviewed in
The I Call, contains \ the whole of : Mr. Curtis'
"History of . the Origiu, Formation and Adop
tion of . the Constitution of 1 the United States,
With â¢ Notices of = Its ; Principal Framers," as
carefully revised \by the I author. The second
volume takes up the history of ; opinion con
cerning the nature of the constitution," and
about one-quarter of the entire text proper, is
devoted to this ; subject. Tne author then dis
cusses the events which preceded the inaugura
tion of the constitution, and cites the vindica
tion of its framers against the charge of incon
sistency. Of particular interest just at present
is the chapter -on the first revenue law of the
United States and tne discussion of the tariff
question, which was such a living issue at the
time of tno oirth of the Republic
We find, for instance, that in the first
revenue legislation after the constitution was
adopted it was deemed proper to make the en
couragement and protection of our own manu
factures one of the principal objects to be
effected by the legislation. "This was but the
continuation of a policy previously acted upon
by the separate State?, but ineffectual because
the Slates could only lay duties on foreign
products brought into their own dominions.
The situation of the country was virtually the
same in 1789 as it has been since in its rela
tions with other nations, the difference be
tween that and any subsequent period being
in respect to the quantity oi importations and
the quantity and kind of our own products.
There were the same questions then as now in
regard to the encouragement and protection
of manufactures existing among us, aud those
which might be introduced and established
luter."
Among the conclusions drawn from the first
revenue law and the debate which preceded its
enactment are these:
"Firstâ The entire freedom of trade, how
ever theoretically right, is inexpedient and
impracticable for a country of diversified pur
suits in which capital and industry are em
ployed in agriculture, in navigation, iv manu
factures, in fisheries and in mining. The situ
ation of the country at any given time, rela
tively to other countries, however that situa
tion may have been produced, wnether by its
o'-rn legislation or \yf the action of other coun
tries, must determine what foreign commodi
ties shall be free and what shall be subjected
to imposts and duties. This situation will
vary at different times and the legislation
must, thersfore, vary from time to time; but
when, for a long course of years, the capital
ana industry of the country or of considerable
parts of it have been employed in particular
products and pursuits sudden changes for
whatever reasons cannot be made without
causing great disturbance and loss of national
wealth.
"Secondâ That the power conferred on Con
gress by the coustitution to lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts and excises, subject
only to the condition thnt they shall be uni
form throughout the United States, taken in
connection with the circumstances existing
at the time of its establishment, warrants the
deduction thnt when the National Govern
ment needs, as it must at all times need,
revenue it may resort to direct or indirect
taxation or as it Is now called to an internal
or external revenue or to both; that the latter
is always to bo preferred to the former, be
cause it is more easily collected and more
easily paid, the burden falling upon those who
consume the articles, the price oi which is en
hanced by the duty, thus enabling tbe legis
lative power to distinguish between the lux
uries and the necessaries of life, and that
when the revenue Is raised by indirect taxa
tion or by imposts on foreign commodities
Congress is empowered and is under an obli
gation to so regulate the duties as to encour
age and protect domestic capital and domestic
industry."
Thus was the solid groundwork laid for the
cause that to-day is being so ably championed
by William McKicley and Republican leaders
throughout the Nation. It is further shown
that, at the very birth of the Republic, when
ever comparisons were instituted between the
interests of labor as distinguished from the
interests of the capitalists who employ tbe
labor, it was considered that the American
laborer would enjoy a higher rate of pay than
the same labor enjoyed in other countries, as
an incident to the encouragement and protec
tion of the capitalist who employed him. In
other words, it was considered that the inter
ests of capital and labor, so far as they are
capable of distinct appreciation, would both
be promoted by legislation which tended to
exclude foreign competition in our own market
because/that legislation would enable the em
ployer to pay the employed higher wages than
were paid in other countries.
In this second volume, also of great interest,
is the history of the "Territorial clause" of the
constitution and an explanation of its purpose.
The Missouri compromise is treated ably and
clearly, and much of the general misunder
standing on many points is cleared away. The
Dred Scott case receives its share of attention
in connection with the discussion of the anti
slavery agitation, and is followed by a treatise
on Lincoln's constitutional policy and an
analysis of the reconstruction period.
Mr. Curtis proposed to write chapters for this
volume under the following titles, but died
Carolina. Of course he naively suggested
that a like favor from Mr. Huntington
would be appreciated, etc., etc Hunting
ton, who had never heard of Mr. Hatch's
road", leaned back in his big revolving
chair and asked quietly, "This road of
yours, Mr. Hatch, how long is it any
way?" Without hesitating, he replied :
"It is ten miles long, sir; but by
George, it's just as wide as your own."

CLEVER BUT HARMFUL.
YOGA PHILOSOPHY; LECTURES OP THE
SWAMI VIVKKANAND* ON RAJA YOGA.
Published by Longmans, Green & Co., London,
New York and Bombay.
Students of Oriental philosophies know that
there are two systems of Yoga taught in India
âone the Hatha Yoga, the other Raja Yoga.
It is entirely of the latter system that these
lectures purport to treat, and though Patan
jali's aphorisms are quoted and annotated in
the volume, but few will agree tnat the learned
Swaml has given his book the correct title.
There is more of Hatha Yoga in these lectures
than of anything else. Many physical prac
tices are recommended and many physical
benefits to be derived from their employment
held out as inducements to the student. This
Yoga philosophy, it might be explained to the
lay reader, comprehends tho control of the
mind by the power of the will, either for self
ish or for altruistic purposes, and either by
concentration of the thinking principle upon
lofty metaphysical abstractions, or Dy the use
of certain very dangerous ana harmful physi
cal practices or self-torture. Vivekanandaâ
who, by the way, is a very intellectutl East
Inniau, who handles the English language
very gracefully and with some degree of art in
composition â does not advise physical tor
ture, it is true, but his book is, upon the
whole, a harmtul one and calculated to de
grade and materialize a system of philosophy
that in many quarters is revered as the spir
itual wisdom of great sages.
A BOOK ON SWEET PEAS.
SWEET PRA REVIEW. By Jamos Spronle. San
Francisco: The Murdoclc Press. For sale at all
the bookstores; price 25 cent*.
James Sproule has proved himself not only
a successful and studious horticulturist, but a
man with literary leanings and of more than
the average ability in handling tbe Queen's
English. His "Sweet Pea Review" is a very
neat and well-written little volume that was
needed, for tbe sweet-pea fad is a healthy one
and lasting. All the different varieties of these
delicate, sweet-scented blossoms of beauty are,
in tbe Review, arranged in color groups and
classified according to type. There are also
many valuable, critical notes and much in
formation of a practical and scientific charac
ter. To quote the words of Mr. Sproule's pre
face: "A brief, definitely worded 'Review of
Sweet Peas' must prove interesting to the
horticultural world. Accuracy has been
aimed at, and our conclusions, derived from
the broad plane of practical experience gained
in our own seed-growine domain, are trust
worthy. Copious notes and endless compari
sons in our lieids ere here condensed iuto con
venient aud practical form, and while not per
haps perfect in every respect they will bÂ«
found peculiarly convenient. It is our effort,
by co-operation, to still further ennoble the
charming sweet pea, and in pursuance of that
end the present little publication, the fruit 01
recreative moments snatched from a busy life,
is respectfully tendered to flower-lovers."
A STORY OF SECOND LOVES.
THE VIOLET. By Julia Kiffrnder. New York:
Longmans. Green & co./frablishors. for sale by
William Doxey; cloth; price, $1 25.
An interesting novel, this, of life and love in
the upper social circles. Tbe story has a good
moral tone. Its chief concern is with the
affairs of a Deautiful woman, who has (in a
past that she is struggling to forget) been the
victim of a rash and most mistaken marriage,
and who has been employed to chaperon an
heiress, the latter having a guardian whose
experience in matrimony had been happy,
though of short duration. As chaperon, in
pleasant surroundings, in a place of safety and
peace and rest, the beautiful woman comes
again to believe in the goodness of human
beings ana the possibility of peace. The
guardian in question entertains peculiar be
liefs about marriage, which had once led bim
to the resolution never to wed again. Guar
dian and chaperon become love's philoso
phers. The reader will find ;nueh to be td
mirsd about the story. One of the lessons is
that wisdom, born of experience, may be re
lied on to banish false notions of living and
loving. The book is illustrated by Charles
Dana Gibson and. needless to say, the draw
ings are fine specimens of the illustrator's art.

activities of their healthy fellow-beings, and
who are willing to make effort to render their

KINO NOANETT. By P. J. Stlmson (J. S. of
.: Pale.) *. Boston and â  York: . Lnmson, Wolfe
it Co., publishers. For sale by A. H. Kebertaou;
price 9--
In the realm of fiction this novel is entitled
to a high place. It is supposed to be the story
of Bamnfylde CareAv, oue of the earliest settlers
on the Upper CharK-s Kiver, in Massachusetts.
As it relates to the Cromwellian period, it is
told also in the style ia vogue at about that
time.
"He speaks without fear or lavor," remarks
the author regarding his creation, Carew, "and
1 have printed it as written, altering only the
spelling; and although occasionally he uses
words only suited to the robusier stomachs oi
his time, I have let them stand; partly that
the sweet and noble temper of his story atones
for them, partly that our own stomachs are a
tnfia over-queusy (as to words alone)."
Views are expressed on a number of subjects,
notably Cromwell and the later Puritans,
which, the author remarks, "would have ren
dered their publication inopportune in New
England at a time much before the present."
But if he Â«ets forth those matters in a some
what novel light he is severer still upon cer
tain phases of early life in Virginia. Miles
Courteiiay will, beyond doubt, be considered
one of the very best drawn Irish characters of
the highest type in all literature. The sur
prising events which sccompany the meeting
of Carew with Kfng Noanett mnko a strong,
dramatic close to a book that fascinates the
reader from the beginning. The love tale that
runs through the story is as pure and sweet as
any that ever was told. The author dedicates
"to the memory of John Boyle O'Reilly this
book, so often planned together and now exe
cnted alone." The illustrations, by Henry
Sandham, R.C.A., are superb.

This makes a very attractive volume for the
childrenâ a good birthday present. It con
tains several full-page water-color illustrations
that are very handsome. They are rich in col
oring, aud yet in very good taste. They will
appeal to the children, and be rather an aid to
their artistic education. As much can hardly
be said for the letter-press. It is not bad or
harmful, perhaps, like the letter-press of many
cbildreu's books, but it is rather colorless and
tame and scarcely interesting for the wide
awake, bright babies of our day. However,
the pictures more than make up for this fault,
and no child will fail to be delighted with the
gift.
TIMELY LESSON IN FINANCE
FIAT MONEY INFLATION IN FRANCE.
By Andrew I>. White, LL.D. New York: 1).
vppleton & Co.. publishers. For sale by Doxey;
paper, price 26 cents.
This able, authoritative paper by the well
known college professor has been reprinted in
response to a demand, in order that it may be
of use during the present campaign in show
ing to what folly, cruelty, wrong and ruin the
p;isÂ«on for fiat money may lead. A special
reason for issuing this new edition lies in the
fact that the principle involved in the pro
posed unlimited coinage of silver In the
United States is, at bottom, identical with the
idea which led to that fearful wreck of publio
and private property in France. An added
reason is that the utterances of the Chicago
nominee and of the Populist platform point
clearly and unmistakably to unlimited issues
of paper money hereafter. The author de
clares that Bryan's Populist supporters are
logical enough to see that it would be Incon
sistent to stop at the unlimited issue of silver
dollars, which really cost something, when
they can issue unlimited paper dollars, which
virtually cost nothing.
Professor White says that It is but just to
acknowledge that the French proposal was
vastly more sane than that now made in our
own country. The French issues of paper
rested not merely "on the will of a> free peo
ple," but on more than one-third of the entire
landed property of France: on the very
choicest real es'Ate in city and countryâ the
confiscated estates of the church and the fugi
tive aristocracyâ with power to use the paper
thus issued in purchasing this real property at
very moderate prices.
"Our proposed unlimited issue of silver,"
says the author, "rests on we know not what:
and the proposed if sue of paper rests solely
on the judgment, the will aud the schemes
for political success or personal gain of those
Populist financiers who shall be put in control
at Washington, and who will doubtless be
astute enough to see and to use the enormous
possibilities for stock-jobbing and gambling
in values which will accrue to-those who, by
controlling the issues of the circulating me
dium, can raise or depress the price of every
share of stock, every bond, every yard of every
fabric, every ounce of every commodity within
the United States."
Voters who are still wavering In doubt on
the financial question should read this con
vincing paper on "Fiat Money in trance; How
It Came, What It Brouzht and How it Ended."
FOR LOVERS OF MYSTERY.
A COURT INTRIGUE. Ey Basil Thompson. New

by Doxey; paper, price 50 cents.
This book is a queer mixture of the grotesque
and serious and the reader is for a while in
doubt wnether the author is in jest or earnest.
The king, the court and the country are all
mysterious. The characters are nearly all mis
fits in their stations. The gardener, for in
stance, made an excellent librarian, but Knew
nothing of gardening. The coachman arcw oil
his ideas from a book on the horse. The keep
er of the poultry had been a solicitor in a pros
perous practice and was quite prepared to
change places with the lord president of the
council when that dignitary was dismissed
from office. Side by side with this tomfoolery
runs a vein of seriousness, but in the solution
the author entirely justifies the juxtaposition
of -the two elements. It is a good book for
lovers of mystery.

One Lovely
Dress That Is Worn by a
Pretty Woman
Such a "beauty dress" was worn one
day last week by a pretty woman. I will
slightly change the coloring and describe
it as being made of an exquisitely fine
ladies' cloth of a pearly hue. The skirt
falls most gracefully, and is entirely with
out ornamentation and hangs free from
the silken lining, as no good dressmaker
nowadays sews silken and woolen goods
together. The lining, of a turquoise blue,
has five narrow frills edged with Valen
ciennes lace. Truly charming is the bolero
of blue velvet, exactly matching the lining.
It is scalloped all around, each scallop
being beautified with an applique of
creamy-yellow real lace, and here and
there a few iridescent beads are intro
duced with happy results. The bolero is
cut so as to reveal a lovely vest of blue
silk, completely covered with fine applique
lace; and I almost foigot to tell you that
all over the velvet bolero are embroidered
in gray and bluish silks tiny fleur-de-lis.
Encircling the waist and skirt are twisted
bands of white and dark-gray striped
velvet ribbon, which are introduced with
truly chic effect. The sleeves are of the
cloth, with diminutive puffs and several
rows of fine shirring. They extend to the
wrists only, but frills of the lace reach to
the knuckels. Such a frock would serve
as an excellent model for many a calling
dress this winter.
A littl* toilet, which will be worn at
one of our leading hotels by a stylish
matron, is of a very fine white mohair,
which is covered with very long-stemmed
corn flowers, turquoise blue in color. The
entire gown is over white taffeta glace
and the bodice has lovely square revers of
velvet, which exactly matches the leaves
of the flowers; these are edged with a fine
fancy lace, a deep corselet to the velvet
ties in a large bow in the back with long
ends. The result is all that could be de
sired. From an excellent house comes a
simple creation of the palest gray satin,
the skirt hangs perfectly and the square
cut bodice is made without a single seam
apparently. It is covered with a pale
mauvre accordion - pleated chiffon, on
which is appliqued fine duchess lace.
The sleeves are small puffs of the chiffon.
A corselet of the gray satin is very effective
and concludes in long sash ends, with
quillings at the sides of the mauvre chif
fon, seven rows of which edge the sash
ends, and frills of mauvre taffeta are to be

"You oughtn't to work on your birth
day," said Corinne, who wanted company.
"Can'i you do your article to-morrow?"
Hester looked ud impatiently.
"Haven't 1 told you that Sally Waters
isn't going to tafce charge of the literary
page of the Courier any longer, she has so
much to do on the regalar sheet?" she
demanded.
"Well, what of it?"
"Hasn't somebody eot to take charge of
that page? Wouldn't a little money
coming in every week be a good thing for
this turned, dyed and made-over family?"
Corinne stared at the greatness of the
prospect.
"Oh, Hester I Do you think they'd give
it to you?"
''I am going to try for it. That's why
lam slaving so over this article. It is
the best I have done yet. They have
taken nearly everything I've offered, and
Sally Waters herself told me I sent in
good stuff. I don't see why l haven't a
chance."
"We conld pat new matting in the
front room," be^an Corinne, excitedly,
"and have the andirons mended."
"Buy new ones," said Hester, grandly.
"And we would have a new gown apiece.
Oh, there's some one at the front door.
Do see who it is, Corinne."
The younger sister ran downstairs, and
soon reappeared, holding up a yellow en
velope, with the thrilling announcement,
"Telegram for Miss Hester Blanchard."
Hester took it, trying to look cool and
unconcerned, as if telegrams formed a
large part oi her daily mail.
"Hurry up," said Corinne, who was
frankly young and excitable. "Oh, I
know â it's good wishes for your birthday."
"To be sure," said Hester, breaking it
open with a sudden sense of disappoint
ment. Visions of "Your uncle in Pata
gonia has died, leaving you $1,000,000," or,
"Your aunt in New York wants you to go
abroad with her and the giris," Dad been
floating through her head, quite un
checked by the fact that no such relatives
existed. "Why, it is from the Courier,"
she said, and read aloud :
WirÂ«= press rates collect 1000 words your
opinion Carrington's In a City oi the West
apropos local color and characters. Must be in
Friday evening. Answer. Courier.
The million and the trip to Europe com
bined could not have delighted Hester
more than this message when she had
grasped its meaning. The mountain bad
come to Mohammed. If her opinion of this
much wrangled over book was thought
worthy of being telegraphed, press rates
collect 1000 words, surely the literary
editorship was not hopelessly out of
reach.
Probably this was to test herâ a com
petitive examination for the vacant place.
Bhe was trying to decide which magazine
she would prefer to edit, after some years
of journalistic success, when Corinne
broke in on her thoughts.
"Why, It says Fridayâ that's to-day,"
she exclaimed. "Isn't it too bad you can't
do it!" Tumbling aircastles make no
sound. Hester set her lips and, pulling
a pencil out of her belt, wrote distinctly
across the back of the message, "Will
send article as directed. Hester Blanch
ard."
"Give this to the boy while I sadd'e
Punch," she said.
"But how cau you, when you haven't
read the book, and we don't possess it?"
asked Corinne. "You never could get it
in Santa Maria."
"I'll find it somewhere," said Hester,
with the determination of a Columbus.
"This isn't just an ordinary article,
Corinne. It is the beginning of a ca
reer."
Punch was a portly little broncho with
ideas of his own aud prejudices which his
mistress generally respected. To-day,
however, he was laced "like a girl and
forced to gallop every step of the three
miles to Santa Maria, even across the
covered bridge, where he had hesitated
and sidled and edged around sunbeams
every day for the last ten years. He
shrugged impatiently and frowned with
bis ears, grunting disapproval at every
seen on the inside of the dainty skirt.
A bride will shortly leave her home in a
dress consisting of a coat and skirt of
blue-faced cloth with double revers of
white and blue velveteen. A white corded
silk waistcoat, beautifully embroidered by
hand, nas exceptionally handsome but
tons. None of us would object to one of
her tea gowns of the fineat white cloth,
elaborately hand-embroidered in fine gold
braid. Lace and sable tails also enter into
its delightful composition. More I can
not teli you.
A stout young matron has had made
very successfully a dinner dress of a pale
green satin covered with small brocaded
roses. The skirt is of a new pattern,
which does not unduly emphasize the size
of the hips, yet it does not add even an
inch in apparent width to her figure, so
well has madame obeyed instructions.
Very smart is the little jacket of the bro
cade, which is lined with white satin. It
is rather short than otherwise and has no
fullness excepting directly in the back,
where there are two small pleats. The
collar is a turned-down one, edged with
real duchess lace, and the front opens to
reveal a smart vest of chiffon, which mv
lady changes at will. One of her vests of
rose-pink silk, draped with duchess, is
the one I like best with this toilet. The
skirt has a suspicion of a train and is
made over white satin, one of last year's
gowns, which, after leaving the cleaner's
hands, was in good condition. Frills of
lace and green taffeta made it quite up to
date. The sleeves reach the elbow and fall
with a slight fullness, no interderlinine be-
ing permitted. Lace frill completes them.
When Admiral Reguault de Premesuil
recently gave a reception on board Le
Hoche, the Duchesse d'Uzes wore white
gauze over feuille de rose-colored silk, her
draped bodice being held in place by
means of a richly jeweled belt through
which were carried several long stemmed
pink roses; the small sleeves were draped
with roses and her large picture hat was
adorned with the same flowers. A cos
tume of red China crepe was worn by the
Vicomtesse d'Anglemont. It was em
broidered with cerise guelder roses. The
bodice and tabliers were beautified witn
Venetian lace of a yellowish tint, violet
red taffeta was utilized for the waistband.
Her hat was of red straw trimmed with
white guelder roses and their leaves.
stride, but Hester merely gave him an I
absent-minded dig with her heel as though |
nobody else had any right to his own feel- I
ings and skurried on. Sprint, who had
followed as a matter of course, was hope
lessly distanced and arrived some ten
minutes later, his tongue flapping wearily,
and not enough spirit left even to bristle
his thick white pompadour at tne low-bred
enrs of the town.
"Oh, Mr. Saunders!" Hester exclaimed,
plunging through a wire door that the
uninitiated might have thought led to a
tobacco-store, '-have you Carrineton's new
book, 'In a City of tne West?' I want it
so badly." Mr. Saunders followed her
thoughtfully to the stationery depait
raent, which boasted a table ot more or
less battered books.
"What's that?" he said. Hester re
peated her request very distinctly in words
of one syllable.
"You want it In cloth or paper?" he
asfced at last. She gave a great sigh of
relief.
"Either will do, thongh I will take
paper if you have it," she said. Mr.
Saunders thought a few minutes more.
"I did have two copies, but I sold them
both," he said, finally, "I could get it for
you by Monday or Tuesday."
"Oh, dear," Hester exclaimed, dropping
down on a stool. "Haven't you another
copy somewhere? Do find one. I must
have it to-day." Mr. Saunders looked up
with a gleam of intelligence that brought
her ho pefully to her feet.
"Wouldn't to-morrow do? I could tele
graph to the city for it," he said.
"No, I must have it to-day â Friday â and
as early as possible," said poor Hester,
wondering what Sally Waters would do
in similar circumstances. "You sold two
copies," she added suddenly. "Do you
remember who bought them?' : That was
an idea worthy even of the great Sally her
self. She waited patiently for Mr. Saun
ders' mind to catch up.
"I shouldn't wonder if one was Mrs.
Hitchcock," he finally evolved. "You
know her, don't you? "
"Does she live across the square In that
old adobe nouse?"
"How's that?"
"Does she live in the old 'dobe over
there?"
"Oh, no. That's Mrs. Vegetables Hitch
cock. She don't buy books," wiih some
contempt. '-This is Mrs. Postmaster
Hitchcock."
And she livesâ?" Hester was already
half out. of the door.
"Up on Gonzales uvenue."
"That's the street by the Catholic
church?"
"How's that? Yes, you go by the
church. It's three doors from Peralta
street. But she ain't there," he added, as
Hester was unfastening her pony. "She's
gone East. She wanted the book to read
on the train." Hester wanted to swear,
but not being sufficiently emancipated re
lieved her feelings with an explosive "Oh,
dear!"
"And what became of the other copy?"
she asked, too discouraged even to notice
Sprint, who sat looking up at her over
his shoulder, wrinkling his coat to suggest
that a girl's foot is just the thing to rub a
fox terrier's back with.
"Well, now, it was either Miss Castro,
down on Martinez roadâ the schoolhouse
street, you knowâ or Dr. Morton's son.
They were both in" here at the same time
and one bought some paperâ l remember
it particularly because they didn't want it
ruledâ and one got the book. Queer, now,
I can't thinic which was which. I guess it
wasâ no. I ain't sure. You might try
them both."
"Those two of all people," thought Hes
ter, half amused and half dismayed, as
she stepped into the postoffice for the
mail. There were several birthday letters
and packages for her, but she bundled
tnem into the mailbat; unopened, then
turned Punch toward Martinez road as the
less of two evils. Miss Castro hated her

she managed to fasten one of her reins to

meek captivity.
"If Sprint sees a cat, I'm afraid Punch
will have to chase it too," she thought,
with an anxious glance backward as she
rang the bell. Miss Castro herself opened
the door and stood in haughty surprise,
waiting to know what this intrusion
meant.
"Ob, Miss Castro," Hester began, catch
ing her breath nervously, "I am very
anxious to see a copy of 'In a City of the

they thought you might have it. I have

"I heard Dr. Morton's son speaking of it

stopped abruptly and glared down- the

steps. "He must have unfastened him

but Miss Castro interrupted with a coid,
"Excuse me while I go and shut the gate

get the book if she bad to take the man with

is why she stands so high. We'll follow
in her footsteps, Punchie. No, you are

Some fifteen minutes later she came out

son was working, somewhat red, and still
without the book, Out more determined

minister, who lived down by the station
in a red house â cozy little home, more
suited to a young couple than an old

little story of yours in the Courier â waÃ it
a week ago Sunday ? It was the 14th at all
events. I said to myself that if Miss
Blanchard keeps on and continues to
write simple little tales that touch the
heart, instead of emotional, gloomy exag
gerations that nobody cares to read, Santa
Maria will have reason to De proud of
her."
"You are very good," said Hester, and
Punch wondered why he should be kicked
in the side when apparently it wasn't time
to start. "But can you lend me that book?
I have been looking for it all the morning."
"Well, as to that," said the Rev. Mr.
Wheeler, "I am afraid I must refuse. I
hate to say no to a young lady, but not
owning the book any more I don't see
how I can very well lend it, do you?"
Hester could have cried with disappoint
ment. The golden opportunity seemed to
be slipping farther and farther out of her
reach.
"I must have it," she said. "Can't you
tell me what you did with it?"
"Why, I think I can," said Mr. Wheeler
without undue haste. He was fond of
conversing with young ladies (he had
never talked to a girl in his life), and he
had no suspicion of the tragedy under
lying the situation. "I can tell you ex
actly who has it, but I am afraid it will not
help you much, as the gentleman is on
his way to China."
"I won't give up," said Hester to her
self, setting her teetn. "I will find it if I
have to â " A Jone whistle made Punch
start. ''Isn't that the 11:10 train to the
city?" she exclaimed, radiant with a new
idea. "I'll go right over and get the book
myself. I wonder if I have enough
money? Perhaps you had better lend me
a dollar, Mr. Wheeler, if you can." Sally
Waters herself could not have beaten this.
Mr. Wheeler might give, but he had
never been known to lend. Hester made
her request in such a matter-of-courae way
that he had handed over a dollar before
Clover Green
Canvas Cloth Gown Direct
From Far Papee
The Marquise de Maupeon's toilet was
also especially noted, being of turquoise
blue crepe de chine, the skirt was plain on
the hip 3 and round the lower part were
nine small flounces, edged with black vel
vet of the narrowest variety. The bodice,
cut slightly square, was composed entirely
of cream guipure, placed flat over blue silic
and a deep corselet of black velvet. The
elbow sleeves, covered with lace like the
bodice, had a slight drapery of blue crepe
at the top, and were finished at the elbow
with a band of black velvet ribbon and
ruche of blue tulle. The same trimming
was introduced around the neck. On the
same occasion several of the young
maidens looked quite charming, Mile, de
la Vomade having been admired in a
toilet of pink and white glace taffeta, the
neck cut square. The elbow sleeves and
the bottom of the skirt were completed
with a ruche of pale pink tulle. This
dainty girl wore a hat of rice straw, wat
teau in shape, and on it were placed bows
of white eauze striped with silk. Mile. Tal
bot appeared in black and white muslin
over white silk, ornamented with a great
quantity of Valenciennes lace, the neck
and waistband were of violet velvet, and
most becoming was the black lace hat with
its long and beautiful black ostrich plumes.
Other gowns lately commented on in
Paris should receive at least a few passing
remarks. For instance, at an afternoon
reception, given at the end of last month,
a fair Princess was gowned in a taffetas
robe embroidered with shaded convolvulus
and lace insertions on the skirt; the open
bodice had a guipure of Valenciennes lace ;
the sleeves extended to the elbow, but
were not full. Another Princess wore
white China crepe, with bretelles of green
moire, spangled with silver, and the waist
band of tbe same. Her hat was a chic,
Watteau shape, with bows of old rose rib
bon and a wreath of roses. The Princess
Helene was much admired in a perfectly
plain but most wonderfully fine white
muslin, made over pink s:lk. Her long
sash was of green, wide satin, and on an
artistic bat were many loops of green
gauze. A confection of white silk muslin
over white moire was most fetching, and
on the bodice was a quantity of splendid
lace. The yoke was square of the style
alluded to as ala Botticelli. This costume
was completed by a white tulle hat
trimmed with a paradise feather.
he had realized what he was doing, and
when he came to he found himself cling
ing to a shying pony wit^h one hand and a
wiggline fox terrier with the other, while
the conductor held the train long enough
for Hester to buy her ticket.
"There, there, be still, pony. Good
doggie," he exclaimed, too confused to re
member whether it was the horse's bite or
the dog's kicK that there was the most
danger from. Sprint gave such a yelp as
his mistress crossed the platform that the
Rev. Mr. Wheeler was startled out of his
grip. The next thing he knew the dog
was as hopelessly gone aa Sunday's ser
mon.
As Hester dropped into her seat there
was a scurry of paws down the aisle, and
Sprint bounced delightedly up against her.
"You wretch," she exclaimed in dis
may. The impropriety of going to the
city in a riding skirt and a shirt waist had
not occurred to her, but the addition of a
dirty white fox terrier dog did make it
Â«eem a Jittle incongruous. "What shall I
do with you? And what will the conduc
tor say, you imp? Well, it's fortunate
Punch didn't come too. Now, let me see.
I'll get to the city at half-past one, and
I'll go straight to a bookstore. Dear me,
I do look rather absurd. Never mind,
Sally Waters would never stop for looks.
Then I will go up to cousin Kate's and
write the story and one of tire boys can
take it down to the 'Courier' office after
dinner. I will telegraph home and bor
row some things to come â "
There was a sudden violent jerk, as
though somebody had taken her by the
feet and tried to snap her head off, and a
bumping stop, set to frantic whistles.
Sprint and all the men in the car
started out to investigate, and discovered
that a small bridge ahead of them was on
fire. It was promptly put out, but the
bridge was not safe to cross.
"[twill be late in the afternoon before
anything gets through," the conductor
told Hester. "We'll run you right back
to Santa Maria and send a gang down to
fix it."
"It's no use," she said, despondently.
"Fate is against me. What do you sup
pose Sally Waters would do now?
She gave Mr. Wheeler back his dollar
and redeemed her pony with as brief an
explanation as possible and rode straight
home. Once up in her room, she flung tne
mail and herself down on the bed and
cried just as hard as she had been longing
to all the last hour.
"I've failed them after promising I'd do
it," she kept saying over and over. "I
won't get the position and I won't rise,
and we'll all be poor and dowdy and made
over for the rest of our lives." Her hand
touched one of the little packages and she
began to undo it without much Interest.
A very pretty workbag appeared, but
Hester could not feel enthusiastic.
"There's something hard inside," she
said half aloud. "How do you open the
thing? Oh, thisâ" She stopped short
with a little gasp. Inside the bag lay a
small book with Cousin Kate's love and
best wishes, and across its cover ran in
golden letters. "In a City of the West."
"And it had been under me nearly al
the morning," Hester sobbed.
"Oh, you're back," said Corinne from
the doorway nearly half an hour later.
"You found it, then. We saved some
lunch for you and I'll bring it up. How
do you like the book? Are you goins to
sit on it?"
"Not any more to-day," wai the enig
matical answer.
The article was telegraphed over that
eveningâ "press rates, collect one thou
sand words"â and Sally Waters herself
told her a few days later that it was the
best stuff she had turned in yet.
"I was certain you were just the person
for the literary work," she said, "but it
took that article of yours to convince the
old man. You got the wire in plenty of
time, didn't you?"
"Oh, yes," said Miss Btanchard of the
Courier, "I had plenty of time."

One of Vogue's correspondents informs
us that a bride-elect in New York, re
cently returned from Paris, showed her a
very smart gown in clover-green canvas
cloth, beautifully broche in raised black,
witn a Louis Seize scroll design. It was
very noticeable that the skirt lay quite flat
in front and at the sides, and was very
moderate in width ; that it was untrimmed
and lined with silk of the same shade. A
plain under-bodice of the same lining silk
was intended to be tucked into the skirt,
and a wide green velvet corselet, fastened
on tho left, worn over, so that the most
charming little velvet bolero to match,
plissed in vertical lines, might just reach
the top ol this corselet (which was draped
horizontally) when it was slipped on.
The novel way in which the bo
lero was trimmed was quite fascinat
ing. There were specially designed
pieces of Saint Gall guipure, mellow iv
tone, as, for instance, a straight, narrow
border for the bottom of the bolero, which
in front formed a triangle, the point so high
and sharp it rose to the bust line. Then
came a decollete yoke, quite a charming
feature, forming in front two triangles, the
points touching in the center with a point
under each arm, and in the back a single
point dipping toward the belt. The velvet
was cut out beneath the lace and showed a
warm reflet from a rich poppy red poult de
soie, with which the little jacket was lined.
On the left side of bolero were two large
jeweled buttons, one above, the other below
the lace triangle. The neck-band was high
and flat, with a small ruche of guipure, the
least soupcon showing over the band. The
sleeves of cloth were Louis XV model, fit
ting the arm closely, with a small p"2 at
the top and without trimming.
Manby has just completed a chic jacket
composed of a double-faced shawl. It has
merely the natural plaid lining and is
slipped on as easily, almost, as silk and,
besides, is light and warm. Such gar
ments are being made in the finest quality
only. They are to be had in a variety of
coloring, but those in blues and browns
are enjoying the greatest vogue. For in
stance, a dark blue jacket has the inner
portion (in one with the material), in a
soft check or grays and fawns intermixed
with a dash of white, shown in the revers,
cuffs and hood. The very quaint buttons
are in dull gold.

([ There are more marvelous things to the
square mile ia the couniry lying lorty-five
â¢miles southwest of Yuma and 125 miles
southeast of San Diego than in all the
West. That is what prospectors and others
: pay who have been in that section of
Lower California, for it is just beiow the
boundary-line dividing the United States
from Mexican territory. There are those
who say that not even the Yellowstone
Park can show such strange sights as this
part of the desert lying adjacent to the
Cocopah Mountains.
Some day in the not distant futur
â¢ capitalists will make a great resort here in
the Cocopah region, and their guests will
include the lame, the halt and the blind,
as well as the tourists on pleasure bent.
The former will go to bathe in the mud
Bprings, which are impregnated with
various strong minerals; to lave in the
clear hot springs or the ice-cold springs
and to breathe tbe rare atmosphere of the
balmy desert. Wonderful cures have been
effected by these mud springs and the
waters near by. Men have gone from
Yuma to San Diego on cots in the beds of
"wagons, suffering all the tortures of
rheumatism, and in a few weeks come
back to their friends apparently well and
increased in flesh.
But the strangest thing about the Coco
j,ab region, however, is the presence of so
many mud volcanoes. Within an area of
a few miles there are hundreds of spout
ing and fuming volcanoes, throwing black
mud to a height of ten or twenty feet and
. keeping up an incessant sputtering that
sounds like the rattle of musketry. Some
of the tiny craters are never still, while
others are inactive for weeks and then be
come-doubly active again. Down in the
â¢ depths of the earth a dull rumbling, inces
<<4 rant and terrifying, is always heard, and
the surface of the ground for a great dis
tance around the volcanoes is hot and bar*
rtn of all semblance of vegetation.
A lake of black water, black as ink, and
called by tbe Indians Big Medicine Lake,
lies near the volcanoes. Its depth has
never been ascertained by either the In
dians or ti.e white men familiar with the
region, and tbe body of water is believed
to be unfathomable. No living thing in
habits tbe water, although it covers an
area of three by one and a half miies. It
is the source of tbe stream known as
Hardy's Colorado River, which empties
into the Colorado below Yuma. This is a
sluggish stream and very tortuous, the
distance to the Colorado by its winding
course being about 125 miles, while by
wagon the instance is only sixty miles.
Tbe volcano region is on tbe hitrhest
part of the desert between San Dieeo and
Yuma. Tbe water in that locality comes
from the Colorado about twenty miles be
low Yuma, forming a branch carrying
about one-fourth of the Colorado. This
branch empties into a large natural reser
voir almost exactly in the center of the
desert and about twenty miles square.
After the reservoir fills the water flows
north, south and west to all parts of the
desert, constituting one of the most
I complete natural irrigation systems in
the world. All tbe land embraced in
tbe volcano region is owned by Don
Guillermo Andrade, whose possessions
are said to amount to several million
acres in Lower California and Sonora,
on the Mexican mainland. Springs,

"Think of it then to your heart s con

Why, woman alive! Yon can't build a

"At any rate I propose to try." And
with this fixed determination in my mind
I departed to gaze once more upon the
coveted spot where, semi-invalid and
blue, 1 loneed to pitch my tent and estab
lish a summer-house in solitude and
peace.
Truly it was a tempting spot, where one
might well long to dwell. Just there a
deep canyon widened, affording a vist* of
level valley, broad fields, distant ocean and
the nearer bay. A little above this par
ticular few feet of ground the wind blew
hurricanes at timeÃ, a little below it the
swirling brfeezes kept upa constant whist
ling and rustling as they gathered to sweep
up the ravine, but just here was a region
of calm, a small, particular thermal belt,
bo to speak, where no wind raged and no
fog crept in. Two great live oaks nestled
against the hill ana seated with my back
against their trunks I spent the entire day
fensting roy eyes upon the glorious out
look and making plans, plans architec
tural and financial. The former were by
Jar the easier to make and the pleasanter
to contemplate. Toe latter were some
what obscured by the problem that would
intrude itself: Given a bit of ground, a $10
gold piece and one pair of hands â to
produce a bouse. I laid the cold piece
figuratively against the side of the house
I bad in my mind's eye. The ratio wasn't
even 16 to L But I knew I had eot to have
that house and that I coula have no more
money to put into it "I shall build as
big a house aB I can for $10," I said at last,
"and content myself with it"
I Bought a carpenter acquaintance and
asked him about lumber measurements.
He listened to my story, chuckling in
frank glee. I did not mind that, however,
for he set himself to work elaborately
upon what be called the "plans and
specifications for my one-story frame
dwelling." When he had finished, cal
culating down to the last screw in tbe last
hinge, he told me I couid build a snug,
battened cottage 7x6 feet and 9 feet high
on the ridge for $9 65.
â¢'Then that shall be the size of my
house," I smid, and gave him an order
forthwith for the necessary lumber.
"You'll have to excavate," he had told
me, so I "excavated." Tne ground was i
not yet fully dried after the rains and
they told me it was soft. Perhaps they
spoke the truth; I never yet struck pickax
into the proverbial nether millstone, so I
am not prepared to say t at that rocky
hillside is the hardest thing on earth.
Vevertbeiest, after two days' work with
Aick and hoe (I decided in favor of the
Â»%tter tool after throwing out two shovel
f ujs of earth), I had excavated five feet,
into the hillside and had a level space
about 5x6 defined on two sides by an
earth wall as high as my shoulder. Then
1 decided that my house would stand if
one side was propped on stilts, and I p^p
creeks, lakes and rivers abound in the
volcano region, and When the local
ity becomes known it will become noted
for its production of tropical fruits, for
the temperature is high here almost all
the year round.
Horses and mules, moved by instinct,
can only with the greatest difficulty be
made to go near the volcanoes, and they
tread lightly and sniff the air suspiciously
all the time they are forced to remain any
where near. They seem to be afraid of
breaking through the
crust of earth that
separates them from
the infernal regions
underneath. Wen,
more foolhardy and
venturesome, go to
the edge of the spout
ing craters, dip their
hands in the strong
mineral springs ai,d
taste everything in
sight.
The tides of the
Gulf of California are
perceptible forty
miles up the Hardy
River toward the
volcano region. The
river hugs the moun
tains known as tho
Cocopah range, very
rocky and barren
hills. These moun
tains have become
somewhat noted as a
result of the stories
concerning rich dis
coveries of placer dig
gings in the hot
canyons, but men
who know the region
say that the diffi
culties of mining
there make it a pre
carious calling. Tbe
few prospectors al
ways to be found in
the mountains are
compelled to bring
water for dr nking
purposes a distance
of ten miles, and all
dirt from the placers
has to be dry-washed.
A marvel of the
Cocopah region is

ceeded to lay my sills. They were seven
feet long and my five joists were isx feet.
It was while I was sawing my joists that
I learned the difference between a ripsaw
and a crosscut-saw. You can make a neat
job by sawing across grain with a ripsaw,
but when you are working in 3x4 Oregon
pine scantling the operation is attended
by some fatigue. I laid my sills, support
ing the free ends on short pieces of scant
ling, well anchored on big, flat stones. That
day I noticed that some builders at work
on a down town building had tied their
sills and supports by short strips of board,
nailed crosswise to each, so I tied mine in
a similar fashion. I mention this because

my carpenter friend, when he came to in
spect my work, gave a nod of astonished
approval when he noted these ties. The
estimate of $9 66 did cot allow for "tonpne
and groove" floor boards, and my floor
was of inch pine, roughly dressed on one
side. This I sawed ui> into proper lengths
and Â»'toe-nailed" to the joists. Incident
ally, while thus engaged, I ; smashed ;my
thumb, the only casualty connected with
my building operations. - I did not make
any remarks when this occurred, ~ but I sat
down to think about it, and my thoughts
were not complimentary to myself. * I be
lieve I concluded that I was an idiot. At
ail events, I felt rather sick, and, as I had
hit my thumb just as I was â  driving the
last nail in my floor, 1 concluded to quit

forty-five feet in length, and this leviathan
was twice that size. Professor Welch, a
scientist who was with the party, could in
no manner account for tcs presence of the
whale so far from the gulf or ocean. If it
came from the gulf up the Hardy River
the whale was evidently an overgrown
specimen of the cray species, or if one of
the sperm family it had evidently come
into this mysterious part of the world
through 6ubt-rranean passages.

to be unfathomable, and the Indians as
well as intelligent white men believe that
it is connected by an underground passage
with the ocean. If a whale should make
that passaare it would be scalded to death
in the volcanoes and thrown up into

"I can only allow you three-quarters of
a day this time," said my carpenter ac
quaintance, when he saw me posting down
the road. I was too tired even to smile at
the sally, and I think he felt sorry forme.
But next morning I arose rested and
refreshed. My thumb was not even sore â
not half so sore as the blisters on my
palms, left by the pick-handle. How I
blessed the systematic exercise that had
hardened my muscles, the long tramps
and rides of earlier days that had given me
a power to resist fatigue that not even in
validism could wholly destroy. I felt
better still when, on applying the gauge, I
found my floor to be perfectly plumb and
perfectly level. That day I got up my
corners. I nailed each pair of boards to
gether first, then set them erect at the cor
ners, resting each upon two nails driven
in for the purpose, until I had plumbed
them and driven tbe last nail home.
Then came the tug of war. It was one
thing to make a plate, but quite another
and different task to raise it. With all
my strength I pulled at one side until it
rested on the proper posts. Then I raised
the other, but by no contrivance of
strength or ingenuity could I keep it in
place long enough to drive in a nail.
The plate, let me explain to the unini
tiated, is the set of beams that run about
the four sides of a building up where the
roof joins the walls. My plate fell with a
crash. wh.en X went to drive Â» ua.il into it,
part of the country, are a small tribe in
number, but they are large in stature and
well developed, but ignorant. They are
disposed to be peaceable to the whites, but
allow no other Indiana to squat on their
territory. Prospectors bavo said that the
Cocopahs resemble other tribes in the
amount of clothing they can get along
without. But on occasions the Cocopahs
can array themselves in Eeeruly garments
and unseemly paint until they appear
quite stylish, from their own standpoint, I
at least. They exhibit considerable pride
wnen visitors go among them and hasten
to don the best clothes they have, realiz
ing that a better impression is to be mads
on their guests by a show of garments
than could possibly be made with the
naked form or with nothing but the sim
ple breech-clout.
A Cocopah buck possessed of a red shirt
and pair of overalls is classed as a dude
among his jealous associates. Often,
jeopardizing my toes, to say nothing of
knocking itself out of plumb and making
one cornerpost go into a terrible skew
wabble. 1 thought it all out and decided
that my correct course was to go and find
a man to come and help me. What are
men for if not to help women â new as well
as old â out of their difficulties? So I
sought out a clever craftsman, who came,
as clever craftsmen always do when ap
pealed to, and together we raised that
plate. He was very good, and only did
what was absolutely necessary, respecting
to the fullest my determination to do it
all myself, but he gave me some valuable
advice about running up my ridgepole,
and when the plate was secured be stood
contemplating my work with a smile
which I promptly challenged. "Oh, it's all
right," be explained. "I was only smiling
to think you did it," and I was fain to ac
cept the explanation.
The next day I sawed my wall and roof
boards into the proper lengths and found
to my delight the right use of the ripsaw
in filling in chinks. To put them in place
was mere child's play. Close beside the
house grew the two great oaks that shel
tpred me through so many restful nours.
While the house was built upon the ground
the slope of the hill was so steep that the up
per branches of these trees reached around
and over my little building. So, screwing
hinges upon the side nearest the trees I
stayed and cross-stayed it, and then sawed
out a large square, which, turned up ana
securely hooked to the inside of the roof,
left a window that actually opened into
the tree. On the side looking out toward
the valley and the gate a window ran the
whole broadside of the bouÃe, opening by
the simple process of sliding one sash
past the other. I made ray door of
inch redwood, putting it uu with two pairs
o* heavy strap-hinges, and then sawed it
across so that the upper half swings open
independently of the lower. My funds did
not allow for locks and latches, bo wooden
buttons secured it. To batten walls and
roof was an easy task, and at the end of a
week my summer residence stood snug
and tight ready for its furnishing. â¢
The greater pirt of these were in
cluded in the estimate of $9 65- Across
one end of its single room I built a pine
bench, six feet long by three feet wide. I
covered the wall back of this and at the
two ends with barley sacks, tacked se
curely and finished with a strip of lath all
around. A mattress, with a cover of bar
ley sacks, made a comfortable couch, and
within the curtained recess was endless
storage-room. Above the couch I put a
long shelf to hold a few dishey and some
absolutely necessary books. A low stool,
two small benches and a table, all made
by me, constituted the rest of the furni
ture. Tne table and floor were covered,
like the couch, with the ever useful barley
sacks. Two curtftined shelves in one cor
ner made a capital cupboard, and just
outside the dcor, on a place leveled for
the purpose, a rustic tripod held my came
kettle in place over my kitchen fire. The
benevolent old oak lent its sturdy sides
to hold frying pans and tins, never re
senting the pegs driven into its barfc for
that purpose, and clear, fresh water
trickled, free as air, from a little spring
just below. What more could heart de
sire ?
Companionship? In the early days of
my stay up there a small brown toad
came to dwell with me. The place had
been overrun with spiders before bis ad
vent, but he cleared them all out and I
knighted him, dubbing him the "Guardian
of my private peace." Birds came and
nested in the oak trees, and after they de
cided that I was quite harmless would
even venture in through the open window
and help themselves from my table. '

Victor W. Nuttmann of Niles is, per
haps, tbe only builder in California whose
h uses have, with one exception, all been
destroyed by tire. The flames have fol
lowed his work over a period of thirty-five
years and the only structure of his they
have left standing is the one be now oc
cupies himself. As it is the last one left
he looks for it to go any moment.
Few people outside of Niles know old
"Nut," as he is called, but everybody
knows him down that way and gives him
all the respect due the oldest inhabitant
and the oldest resident. Nut is a most
pleasant : man . to meet and a good talker.
He is also a good looking man _ and has a
bead jof white hair that would make the
fortune of a Bishop and a set of whiskers
that would assure him of the highest of
fice within the gift of the Populists. ,
; The 77 years that old Nut \ bat spent Â«on
this earth have been most interesting and
exciting 5 ones to him. According ;to his
own story he % has done v about everything
there is to do, including falling in love and
going fishing with Daniel Webster, Ail
return, the victorious racer to have all thÂ«
clothes of his competitors. A quarrel
among the young fellows over some
damsel is usually settled by a long race,
ami the winner returns to claim his dusky
sweetheart. She is the sole judge of the
contest, and from her decision there is no
appeal. Sometimes, however, the bucks
buy their wives outright, givins-a horse
or a blanket to the parents of a girl, who
submits to the transaction and makes a
faithful wife.
The children of the tribe seldom have
but one name and it is nearly always ol
local origin. It is a common custom to
bestow upon a baby tne name of some
product that is most bountiful at the time
of the child's birth. Thus there are many
Pumpkins, Watermelons, Tules, Rattle
snakes, Coyotes and Pinones. A few
Indians possess' names picKed up arnonjc
the white men who have been among
tnein. One bright young Cocopah, for in
stance, always gives his name as Horace
Greeley; and an old fellow of the tribe,
who has grown fat and lacy and' sits by
his tule hut all day smoking cigarettes, is
known far and wide on the desert as
Grover Cleveland.
The more industrious Cocopahs raise
beans, corn, pumpkins and melons in
abundance. The seed from the mesquite
tree, a pod-like bean, is much relished by
them. When it is crushed into a meal and
mixed with water it ia called "pachety."
The natural resources of the couniry make
living rather easy for the stalwart Coco
pahs. Wild hogs are numerous and fat
all the year round, and the deer that
abound there are of almost incredible size.
Bucks of the blacktail variety weighing
300 pounds dressed are frequently killed.
Tneir Hindquarters are so large that hunt
ers' eyes are made glad as well as their ap
petites. There are specimens of the burro
deer in the Cocopah region. Tney are
large and greatly resemble the moose,
having flat horns.
Tourists who occasionally visit the
Cocopah country are hospitably enter
tained by the Indians â if the natives hap
pen to be ready for them. A party that
recently went among them signified a pre
dilection for eggs, and forthwith two
youDg bucks went a distance of thirty
miles on horseback after the commodity,
bringing them into camp safely in a little
basket of tule made by themselves on the
road. Hunters brought in game daily,
two deer and other kinds of fresh meat
often being in camp at the same time.
Fish and small game were caugut in great
abundance, and water fowl was slaugh
tered for the feathers. Fine sfcins were
obtained from the white pelican or alba
tross.
Although the Cocopah Indians raise
corn and melons in sufficient abundance
to sustain them during seasons of drought,
if any should occur, and during the long
period in summer when the temperature
is too high for the successful production
of such things, nature provides enough
for the Indians to feed upon. There are
wild potatoes, tules, mesquite beans, wild
rice, beans from ironwood, or pala fierro,
beans from the greenwood, or pala verde,
seeds from wild grasses and small bushes,
besides fish and game and eggs from the
haunts of the wild fowl along the Hardy
River. Fbkdebic Bennett.
these things happened before be came to
this part of the world, of course. Since
comins here he hasn't done much except
build houses that burned down and grow
old. But he has done those things to per
fection.
"I was the first American to settle in
Niles," said Nut when speaking of the
matter. "That was thirty-eight years ago,
and the only bouse here then was old
Jesus Vallejo's adobe flourmill that still
stands right over there. It was I who
started Niles, for I opened the first saloon
and provided a resting place for the
ranchers who came to the mill.
"But I was talking about tbe houses
that burned. Well, the first house I built
wasn't the saloon, but a shanty I put up
for myself. It was a comfortable enough
place, but in less than a month it was
nothing but ashes. Don': know bow it
caught fire. Weather was hot and the
first thing I knew I didn't have any house.
Then I built this place that I now live in
and, somehow, it still stands. It is the
oldest house in Niles except the old mill,
and I am the only one that ever lived
in it.
"Funny thing about the way all of my
houses burned. They just went up^like
lightning. Nooody never had time to
save noth ing out of them.
"The first thing anybody knew the
whole building was swathed in flames
that roared and cracked like a blast
furnace. Of course we all tried to put
them out by carrying water from the
crick in buckets and throwing it on the
fire. But we might as well 'a' iised a tea
spoon for all the good we did. The bouses
just burned until they were all gone.
"My old brain don't work as good as it
used to or I could tell you just exactly
how I built the houses and how they
caught fire. But I can't do it now. Ido
know, though, that for a great many years
the only houses in 2s" lies were the ones that
I built.
"All of the houses I built after the first
o ne stood a long time before any of thorn
burned. My saloon burned down after I
had it several years p. ml then the others
c ommenced to go. The fires were a iong
time apart, but they kept right up. The
' first fire, as I said, was less than a month
after I came here and the last was only a
few weeks ego. That house bad been
moved, though, and chanced considerable.
Still it was a house that I built and I sup
pose it had to go iike all the others. Not
one of the houses I built in this town ever
came to an end any other way except by
being burned.
"Am I afraid that this one will burn
down like the others? "Well, I don't Snow.
Tuere are some things that I don't under
stand, like Darwin's theory, lor instance,
and I don't pretend to be able to explain
them. This house is made of wood, like
the others, and it is possible for it to burn.
But it may not. Anyhow, I don't care if
it does. It has been a good house to me
for a great many years, and I suppose I
will not need it more than twenty or thirty
years more at the most. If it has got to
burn, let her bum. There is nothing like
having a clean record. But the next
house I have I will get some one else to
build for me."

THE
NAUTILUS
AND THE
FLY
By Jtervry G. Ghabott.
The sun shone his brightest and the
earth seemed to be crowned with his
golden beams. Over the calm ocean's
vast sxpanse of water gently gli led a tiny
Nautilus. Its dainty white sail was
spread forth to catch each gentle zephyr
as it sped onward toward the setting sun.
Now, there chanced to be near by a little
Fly, weary of wing and almost helpless,
who, when it saw the Nautilus, faintly
called out, "Oh, fair creature of the sea,
with sail like a snowflake on the breast of
the ocean, behold me here, weary ana
alone; take me into your tiny boat or
soon I shall perish." "Nay, poor little
Fly," the Nautilus said; "ask me not
what I dare not do, yet hate to refuse.
Ob, if you but knew the reason why! I
travel onward toward a land unknown to
youâ to a land beauteous and great, where
the breezes are sweet as perfumes of the
east; where rivers dimpled with circling
eddies wind their way through dense
forests; where great spreading trees grow
to their loftiest heights, whose every leaf
Bhelters n fairy, ana wnere little birds fly
through the air warbling sweet melodies;
but I cannot tarry here, for I must away,
so fare thee well."
"Nautilus," said the Fly, "can you turn
me so heartlessly away when your boat
might be a refuge for me? I have trav
eled far and am so fatigued that soon the
jaws of th-' mighty ocean must close upon
me." "Come aboard, then," said the
Nautilus, who was deeply affected by this
piteous appeal, "but move not after you
alight, for if you do then evermore am I
doomed to sail these mighty waters alone. "
The poor Fly, weary and panting for
breath, slowly flew down to the little craft
and sank exhausted upon its deck. After
recovering his strength he said to the
Nautilus: "May I hear your story and the
name of the country you travel toward?"
She replied: "Once I was a fairy princess
and lived in a splendid castle built of
ivory and gold and bestudded with the
rarest and costlieut gems of the Orient.
Often I wandered through the wildwoods
and along the seabeacn alone. One day,
while out for a ramble, I paused to listen
to a bird trilling fortb its bv< etest song to
Us mate, then seating myself on a swaying
fern leaf I watched the flowers n< ddir.g
their dainty heads as if in response
to the whisperings of the wind and the
murmurines of the sea, and saw the rose
blush at the lily s ki<s; but while I wa ched
and listened and felt my sou! expand
with joy at the beautiml picture that lay
before me, the scene was by magic sud
denly changed and the world bidden in
impenetrable darkness. Then the weird
scenes unfolded by zigzag and forked
streaks of lightning that were met before
my affrizhted gaze filled me with sicken
ing horror. This was quickly followed by
a binding flash of licrhtning and a terrific
crash of thunder that dispelled tne dark
ness and revealed to my startied vision a
hideous hag wrinkled and old, with eyes
like coals of fire and claws like the talons
of some mighty bird, who, with grimaces
and violent gestures, approached me.
Her voice was like the thunder and she
was ciad :n the skins of the tiger and the
wolf. Her hat was hig!i and peaked and
on her left shoulder was perched an owl.
In her hand she carried a wand entwined
with many hissing and wriggling vipers.
Then she uttered a blood-curdling howl,
waved her wand round and round
and cried: 'Waters of the sea, roll
onward, and fairy princess thou a Nautilus
must be. Thou bhalt sail yon stormy deep
for one year, and if thou return'st with
one drop of water in thy boat, forever
doomed shalt thou be to sail on that
mighty ocean till wind and storm drive
thee to destruction.' This evil hag then
smote me with her snake-entwined wand,
and lo! I was transformed into the Nau
tilus you now beliold; but a drop of water
has never entered my boat, and with the
favor of heaven, as the sun sinks beneath
the sea in all his golden glory, I shall once
more reach my native land and reign over
my people as of yore."
"Oh, you were afraid I would let
water enter your boat," said the
Fly. "And as for me, I was a fairy
prince, and was transformed into a fly;
and, O, Nautilus," he cried, "I am your
brother. After you had disappeared," he
exclaimed, "I went through the forests in
search of you. It was night and the moon
rose over a distant snow-clad mountain
that sparkled like a heap of silver under
its cold white li*rht. As it rose slowly,
calmly over the mountain's brow the stars
paled and the dark sky smiled to view the
heaven's queen. Her fair beams shot
through the pine tref-s and I saw a thou
sand elves ana fairies sleeping 'neath
every sheltering rock and in every lily's
cup. I heard the breeze sweetly sighing
as it caressed the trees; the brook chatted
merrily when it found that the stars were
reflected in its crystal waters and the sea
sobbed remorsefully for the storm of the
eve before. Fireflies, with tiny lan
terns, flew hither and thither, their will
o'-the-wisp-like lights penetrating every
darksome nook. But while the nightin
gale's song was wafted to me on the
wings of the wind a clcud obscured ihe
moon and darkness reigned supreme.
The songster's melody was hushed.
Fairies, elves, fireflies and flowers were all
swallowed in the dense, black shroud.
After a peal of thunder, amid the noise of
the sea lashing upon the rocks, the evil
spirit of our land appeared. I felt the
earth tremble beneath my feet as she
cried: 'Thy sister is a Nautilus now, sail
ing that restless, merciless ocean, and
thou, 0 Prince, follow her, I command
you, as a Fly I' No sooner had she spoken
than I found myself transformed into a
miserable insect and a great gust of wind
carried me far out beyond the shore. I
had flown many, many days when I saw

sister, have saved your brother's life."
As the sun was sinking in the west and
the sea and sky were like molten gold,
with a faint tinee of pink, like the blusn
of some timid maid, a fair white Nautilus
and a Fly landed on a beautiful shore.
But as soon as the boat touched the land
tne Nautilus was instantly transformed
into a princess and the Fiy into a prince.
Her fac- was fair and her robes were of
the color of gold. The prince drew her
dainty hand throueh his arm and to
gether they walked toward a magnificent
castle. The sea whispered softly that they
had come. It had borne the fairy prince
and princess safely home. The wind then
took the joylul' message and carried it to
ihe furthe-most ends of the land. Myriads
of fairies flew to greet them and gorgeous
butterflies caught them up and bore them
to their beloved home. The birds all
joined in a happy song of welcome, and
every glorious flower breathed out it s
homage and bowed as they passed. They
had returned <-vermor9 to rule over their
devoted subjects, for the evil hag was

PUPPY TALES
NO. 4
By Oli\te Heyder\
HOW PUPPY DID HOUSEWORK.
Such a busy dog was he. Hours were
spent by him in scampering up and
down through the basement â "taking a
walk," we called it. Sometimes when we
had company a terrible racket would take
place under the parlor, and we were forced
to explain that it was only "puppy" sweep
ing the floor of the basement. Then the
company would be puzzled. How could a
dog sweep? Well, this was how. He had
an old broom down there, and when ne
took the notion he would catch the handle
in his teeth and drag the broom up and
down, up and down. He seemed to enjoy
tnis ever so much, and did t every day,
so we said: "Of course he's sweeping his
house."
Then there was the fur rug that he slept
on. Every day the sun shone bright our
funny little doggie would drag the rug
out into the yard and shake and shake ii
till the fur just flew. Then he'd spread it
in the sun. All day long he would leave
it and at night carry it back into his box.
Now, don't you think we were right when
we said he aired and made his own bed?
He piled up his dishes, too. Alice was
not very careful about bringing up the
plates on which his meals were served, so
often be had three or four down ttiere be
sides his drinking pan. Tlie funny little
fellow would pile them all up, and usually
ended by tipping his drinking-water over
them. If he had had a few lessons lam
sure he could really have been a dish
washer.
I had a great tirce Keeping the clothes
out of his way on wash days. He wanted
to carry them all upstairs. I'd miss a
stocking and maybe it would be found up
on i lie porch, or if the door was o; en it
would be sure to be in the kitchen. But I
must save the rest of Puppy's work for a
new story.

When the spellbound girls turned from

and great was their delicht over the idea

claimed. "Oh, Harry, suppose you tell us
why there is so much mystery attached to
this place."
"Very well," answered Harry, with an
air of great importance, and then pro
ceeded to relate the following story:
"Once upon a time there lived a very
wealthy Spaniard, who, awny back in the
forties, Duilt this grand 'Mansion of the
Hills,' as it was then called, and many a
high revel was held here by him and his
boon companions. But one day, after a
long absence, ne brought to this then
beautiful place a fair young bride.
Mauriceâ " Say, Jimmy, what's the matter? Got the mumps?"
Jimmy â "Naw! Got a new bicycle and tried to blow up the tire."
"Now the owner of the castle was really
a wicksd smugcler, but his lovely wife
was in ignorance of his true character tnd
was as pure and good as she was beautiful.
"One day the Spaniard bade bis wife a
loving larewell, telling her he nad to go
away from her on a long journey. Tears
sprang to her eyes and she begged to be
allowed to accompany him. He paid no
attention to her pleading, for he feared if
she traveled with him she might find out
the dreadful trnth and reluse to live with
him any longer.
"Ko he started aloneâ away across the
ocean to a little island, where in a cave he
had hidden hi 3 ill-gotten treasures.
"After a weary time of waiting for the
young woman he returned with many
rich gifts for his loved one, who greeted
bini with ,-uch innocent glee that he shud
dered as he thought how her love would
turn to hatred if she knew the truth, and
he became furious with a tumult of angry
passions at the very sight of her purity.
"She must never know that the hand
she fondly kissed was the hand of a robber
and murderer!
"The only way to prevent this was to
sacrifice her life. On the very night of
this return he took her to that dark room
behmd you, Alice, and soon she was a
corpse."
"Ugh," cried Alice, "you horrid boy!"
as she changed her seat to one facing the
dreadful door.
"Years afterward a party of tourists
found her bones, and so the story goes
that every nisht when the old clock in the
villuge strives the hour of midnight a
beautiful youne woman dressed in white
is seen to swiftly glide past these windows
into the darkened room, and then they
say that moans and doleful sighs fill the
air until break of day."
With thtse words Harry looked cau
tiously around as if he expected the ap
narition to appear at any moment.
"I've heard a better story about it than
that," remarked Phil Barker, a little jeal
ous of the admiring glances cast on Harry
by the girls, when he had finished his
sensational story.
"Oh, let's hear it!" they cried all at once.

RICHARD
J. VINCENT
THE BOY GLOBE CIRCTJMNAVIGATOB.
He came to Mariposa Wednesday even
ing, and, after presenting his numerous
undeniable credentials, was entertained at
our best hotel and given free use of the
livery stable. On Saturday the Gazette
contained his picture and a little sketch
of how a boy of 15 had traveled without
money over the whole world and was now
returning to his home in New York. Then
on Sunday morning 1 had the good for
tune to meet him. It was a meeting that
I shall never forget.
For it is not "what he does but what he
is" that wins him courtesy everywhere,
that keeps him happily away from the
money mazes of the present month. He
needs not gold nor silver, but just his
rank smile, clear blue eyes, quick unself-
ish manner, warm boyish heart and
sturdy little frame to carry him over the
waters, around the world, into the homes
and memories of princes and peasants and
again to tha arms of his loving, trusting
mother.
He was running down the street with
the Sunday-school children when i spoke
to him, and he turned to me with more
childish deference than did any of his
younger companions.
"Do you find no trouble traveling with
out money?" I asked.
"On, no, ma'am," he answered, in his
bright, earnest way. And for the first time
that little word "ma'am" sounded wonder
fully pretty. "I always ride in the Pull
man. I sent my trunk on to San Fran
cisco, and that is why I look so ba i here."
"But why did you come away off here?"
"Ob, I always go into the interior. In
India, in â "
But my interest was so centered on the
boy that I did not care to hear about the
countries.
"Do you speak French?"
"No, ma'am ; but I learned a little Hin
dooâa little of almost every language â
and I make signs. Why, sometimes I did
not know a word, yet people understood
me."
"What in all the world do you think
grandest? 1 It was a foolish question and
for an instant he seemed puzzled.
â¢â¢The Hawaiian volcano is erand," he
said. "The crater is about as big as this
square, filled with great red, rollinz waves
and spray. And at times domes of lava
rise up and fall over. It i 3 hot then and
you can't touch it with your hands, but I
have a piece that I will give you."
Of course, like other ordinary mortals, I
have read descriptions of volcanoes, nave
seen the panorama of Kilauea at the fair,
have listened hours to Professor Le Conte
on his loved subject, but this child's eyes
threw the reflection into mine. 1 saw it
vividly, as if we were standing on the edge
of that burning sea.
Then we went into the church, and,
thojgh the healthy young spirits could
not be quite subdued, be kindly helped
the younger boys with their lessons.
When we were out again in the sunlight
he looked sober and said:
"A year to-day I was in the Holy Laud."
I knew then that a pretty illusion of the
children would be shattered. They
crowded around him, their little faces
animated with love for Christ's "beauti
ful" home. Kilauea was nothing to
them. But Nazareth!
"It is all beautiful there," one little boy
said.
"No," he answered slowly. "The poor
est little houses yon can imagine, all fall
ing on top of one another. It is not what
one sees there that one eoes for. I was at
the Holy Sepulcher. That is nice, and
there are so many Greek priests."
Just here when I cared most to listen
some one called me, and when I returned
he was telling of an adventure in the Red
Sea, how the captain had told him the
story of the waters opening for the Israel
ites to cross and closing upon Pharaoh's
army, and he, leaning to loot for one of
Pharaoh's vanished chariots, had fallen
overboard. "And, but for the captain,
the waters would have closed upon me,"
he said, laughing.
Many interesting things he told, in all
of the others omitting those dear little
pronouns "me" and "I." Only when he
found it was about himÃelf I cared most
to hear, be said, with a charming mingl ; ng
of bashful ness and pride.
"I shall be 16 next year and have an ap
pointment to the nautical school at
Annapolis. My father was a naval officer
and I was born on the Mediterranean. I
love the water better than the land."
"And what is your country?" I asked.
"America. My father was a Texan. I
have written for the New York Sunday
World. lam writing a book, and will let
you see my description of the volcano if
yon wish."
I did wish very much, but declined un
less he would bring it, while he, looking
down at his dustworn clothes, shook his
head. So I felt that I had missed a treat,
for if his book is as good and simple as his
words we shall all want to read it.
"I am tired of it all now, though," he
said in a tone at once boyish and manly.
"I want to go straight home to New
York."
And that evening Tihile he played tag
with the boys I thought of all his bright
restless young life, and prayed that God
would guide him in the future as he has in
the past. May S. Corcoran, Mariposa.

Dear Editor: You may have Forgotten that I
have written letters to The Call before, but it .
was so long ago I am almost ashamed to say
so. In my last letter I to.d my age, which was
10, and how much I enjoy reading the chil
dren's pages. I read a great deal of most any
thing I can find.
I ask my mamma or papa if I ought to read
this or that, and if they say "no," of course I
do not read it.
In our town there are no news stands or
stores, and the only way we get a paper or
book is from thb passenger-trains. They pass
here four times a day, two east and two west,
and a good many freight-trains go by, too.
We do not have time to get lonesome, al
though there is uot much fun here during the
summer, but in winter, if the snow does not
get too deep, we have a great deal of pleasure
with Rieds, snowshoes and toboggans.
I did not try to solve any of the puzzles thii
time. I had so many lessons in school that
had to be attended to at home that I did not
try very hard to solve the puzzles, and I
wanted to write my letter in time so It could
go into next Sunday's Call. Your little
friend, Retha Waldau.

flow a Blind
Gipl Printed a
Library of JWusie
"I print my own music," said a blind
girl. "I have a large library which I have
printed. See, here is Mendelssohn's
Sonata in C. Here are twenty of John
Sebastian Bach's 'Inventions,' and here is
the 'Sonata Pathetique,' by Beethoven;
organ music, too, and songs."
Was the sightless face pathetic? No, on
the contrary, the speaker was jolly, sun
shiny, radiant, triumphant. She sang a
song about "Moonlight Splendor," and
her voice soared and sang like a skylark,
with never a suggestion of regret in it
that the moonlight splendor could not
dawn on her except through her imagina
tion.
What does the printing of music in-
Tolve? Two staffs or three, accordiug to
whether it is written for the piano or the
organ, must be covered with notes, rests,
expression marks, phrasing, signatures,
accidentals and so on. There must be let
ters to indicate the use of pedals and
stops, and the hand to be used in playing
one part cr the other. Where there are
eyes an etude must have figures to indi
cate the proper fingering. Then there are
the riiir.innedo and decgescendo angles to
be constructed, the staccato dots, the
slurs, ties, '.he movements, the accel
erando and the reverse, the tempo, the
qualifying conditions, all to be indicated. J
Take the music of the modern school, ;
particularly Weber, Wagner, Mendels
â ohn and so on, and the accidentals neces
sary for their harmonic purposes are scat
tered along the pages "thick as autumnal
leaves that strew the brooks of Vallom
brosa." The thick chords and sudden
transitions in tempo and key puzzie tho
stilled musician, who, with full sight,
wrinkles his or her brow and studies over
their unexpected complications.
Sum it all up and it shall be truly said,
as of common knowledge and belief, and j
absolutely correct, that lo transcribe the |
modern syinphomy, concerto or fugue is
as lar above the copying of ordinary read
ing matter as the work of the learned
Champollion at the Pyramids exceeds that
of the schoolboy who awkwardly copies
a "Mother Goose" tale for practice in pen
manship.
How, then, shall the totally blind learn
to Katie copies of great musical composi- j
tions which embrace hundreds of j
thousands of notes, scores and scores of j
expression marks, the mo?t unusual and
remarkable harmonic combinations, and
never make a mistake?
This question was suggested by the
statement of the blind girl that she could
write her own music and that she al-eady
has a library of it which she has created.
The speaker was Miss Gussie Mast of
Berkeley. Questions led to the unrolling
of what may be termed a modern musical
romance, having the added charm of
strict truth.
.Miss Gussie .Mast, the Blind Sirl Who Prints .Music.
"All our music," said Miss Mast, "is
written in a straight line, regardless of the
position of the notes on the staff or whether
they are above or below the staff. Signa
tures, tempo, expression marks and all the
rest of it proceed in an undeviating line.
The notes which make up chords follow
each other singly in due succession, and
we denote the position of the note and the
composition of a chord or series of chords
by intervals. The same applies to runs in
which there are skips. Knowing the time
and the value of notes that in the aggre
gate are found in any one measure, we
have no difficulty in locating the chords.
We have to reason, oh, yes, of course.
"Now you will see that there must be a
separation of the d ifferent parts â the right
hand part from the left-hand part â to
make it clear, and then, in organ music,
there is also the pedal part. Each part is
written separately and every one in a per
fectly straight line or series of straight
lines. Every gracie of value is indicated.
Thus we have sims for the whole notes,
half-notes, quarter-notes and eighth-notes,
and he smaller subdivisions are indicated
by the use of the same signs. We make
out that by the amount which we know
must be in the measure, which Is. of course,
a fixed quantity, indicated at the begin
ning of the movement. We have sisyis
for every possible expression marE and all
that is] implied by that, tics, slurs and
so on.
"The intervals are indicated by an arbi
trary understanding. Thus in the treble
the intervals read downward always.
Take the chord of C natural for familiar
illustration, In the right-hand part the
intervals would read as follows: C, 4, 6,
8. In the leit hand the intervals read up
ward, and in the same chord the reading
would be C, 3, 5, 8. This is the outline of
the system, and now for the mechanical
part, the printing."
Miss Mast went to a small machine, fit
ted up with certain white and black keys,
which do not resemble the arrangement
on the keyboard of a piano in any one oc
tave, but which gave the appearance of a
keyboard in other respects. Between roll
ers she deftly inserted a Bheet of prepared
paper, finding no difficulty in adjusting it
to a nicety in the complete darkness which
enveloped her. Cheerfully she drummed
away for a few seconds, sometimes using
only one key, then a combination of two
keys, and so on, and thereby produced the
â example in musical notation which is here
reproduced. This she first made on paper,
which, being perforated, left projections
which to the delicate fingers of blind mu
sicians mean notes, etc., at the bottom of
the notation example being also a part of
"Yankee Doodle.''
Next she seized a thin zinc plate and in
serted it between the rollers of another
machine, which was equipped with a part
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1896.
Compensations for Lost Vision
of a keyboard like the first, having also a i
pedal. With this combination she speed
ily reproduced the musical perforations in
zinc which had before been only in the
paper. With this plate she could print,
on prepared and moistened paper, any de
sired number of sheets of the same music.
Thus it is that it has been a comparatively
easy matter to accumulate not only a musi
cal library for one person's use, but also
to produce duplicates indefinitely.
"Let not the blind lead the blind lest
both fall into the ditch" runs a revered
and time-honored saying. But when
Gussie Mast prints exercises, eludes,
sonatas, etc., she not only leads blind
musicians without leading tbem into the
ditch, but successfully guides them
through musical intricacies which might
well puzzle persons who have unimpaired
vision.
It will naturally suggest itself to all
musicians and to those having only the
most superficial contact with music, theo
retically or practically as executants that
having all the treble written by itself, line
after line, and the bass also written in the
same way, especially where there ia a pedal
part for the organ added, here is a
Pearls on tlje Floor of tlje Ocean
The agent of the English proprietors of
the concession granted by tne Mexican
Republic for a monopoly of pearl-nshing
in the Gulf of California recently arrived
in San Francisco and cave some interest
ing details of the present methods em
ployed in their industry, which has con
tinued ever sinCe the occupation of tho
country in the time of Cortez.
The whole coast of the Gulf of Califor
nia abounds in pearls, and the conces
sions control the entire territory. Until
within the last few years native divers
were employed, and the depth to which
they could descend did not exceed thirty
five feet. With the introduction of diving
apparatus the limit of depth was increased
to thirty fathoms. The best divers could
formerly remain under water not to ex
ceed two minutes. A modern diver thinks
nothing of a two-hour stop in water a
hundred leet in depth, though at greater
depths the stay is necessarily shortened
on account of the enormous pressure of
the superincumbent water. A diver,
when upon the floor of the ocean, looks
about for the oyster which he tears from
the object to which it is attached, and
places it in a small bag hanging to a rope
which is hauled into the boat on a given
J\ Hut Tbjt Was Built by Satan
"It was built by the devil, senor," said
old Rodrigo Otero, in answer to a ques
tion concerning the age of a dilapidated
adobe house that stands on the banks of
Alameda Creek not far from Niles.
And old Rodrigo may be right for all
anybody living knows. The house re
ferred to is used as a sort of storeroom for
a nursery, but none of the worK of storing
is done by the Mexicans or Indians living
near by. They would almost as soon think
of cutting off their right hands as going
inside the accursed structure.
There is no record known to exist that
tells who built tho place. It is said to
have been there when the mission back
on the hill was built.
The present owner says it was on the
lond when he bought it, many years ago.
It did not take him long to find out that it
was "haunted." In his estimation it may
be only the imagination of the natives,
but if the stories they tell are true the
place ought to be the abode of spirits.
"Nobody knows more about that bad
Queer Lake and a Marked Indian
Lake Eleanor lies in a secluded valley
on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada
Mountain! in Tuolumne County. Sur
rounded oy lofty trees and loftier peaks,
the clear blue plain of water, two miles
long and one mile wide, ripples and smiles
above the skeletons of a lost tribe.
This lake has been known to white
settlers of California for at least forty
years, though very few have ever heard of
it and fewer still have seen it. Indians
and sheepherders are its only visitors.
To look at it would give proof of the un
usual and would prepare the mind to
credit the story of its formation. Stand
ing out in the water more than 100 yards
from shore is a group of large fir trees,
dead but upright, with their roots in the
bed of the lake, thirty feet below the sur
face. There they stand, monuments of
the past, to prove that they were there
before the water came.
What is now Lake Eleanor was once a
large and lovely valby, on the floor of
Jin International Boundary Line
In several late Issues of various news- I
papers, more particularly on the Pacific !
Coast and of the National capital, there
have appeared articles during the last few
months criticizing the manner in which
the boundary line was run between tho
United States and the Dominion of
Canada, and seriously questioning the an
nouncement of the British Government,
that the line was perfectly correct. This
criticism has related more to the boundary
line on the extreme westerly portion of
the continent than to any other part.
The contentions of both sides are remark
ably convincing, and it is hard to tell by
reading the arguments pro and con what
tho real status of the matter is.
It was my good fortune a few months
ago to meet a gentleman in Chilliwhack,
British Columbia, who, being present dur
ing the operations of the Boundary Com
mission, knows a great deal about the
matter. He unhesitatingly declares that
the line has been wrong from the begin
ning and that a peculiar error of judg
ment on the part of the leaders of both
commissions has been responsible for the
whole trouble. Mr. Btcvenson (for that is
my informant's name) ia a well-known
rancher and mine-owner in British Colum
bia. He told me the following facts during
our conversation:
"In September, 1860, I was gold mining |
on Rock Creek, when the American engi
neers and the British engineers, then
locating the 49th parallel and putting up
the monuments, met near Boundary
Creek, the British engineers coming from
the west and the Americans from the
east. Well, as I say, the parties them
selves met, but their surveys did not, by
over 300 yards. The British line was
north. Each party kept on stubbornly at
its work, and before they ceased opera
difficulty which no musician with eyes is |
compelled to face. On the contrary, music 1
calculated for seeing is written all to
gether, the bass under the treble, and the
skilled reader of music takes in both i
staffs, or three, if there be three, simul- ;
taneously. This leads to perhaps the j
most remarkable part of this musical
romance of the blind.
Naturally, the Mind musician must [
memorize every composition for perform- I
ance. As she cannot learn the treble and j
bass at once, it follows that she encounters |
a problem much more complex than is j
presented to the musician with eyes, es
pecially when modern music of the lighter
class is considered. This can be explained
so that it wi 1 be easily as intelligible to J
the unmusical as to the musical. Take
one measure, for instance. Possibly the
treble mny consist of four groups of five j
notes each and the bass consists of eight j
notes of equal length and the pedal part ]
moves in a different way, perhaps four)
notes of equal length or three notes of i
equal length and Jour notes which to- j
get her equal in time value one of the others. '
Let the reader attempt first to strike his ;
right hand twenty times on the table, then j
signal. Sometimes the number of oysters
secured is large, at other times pnly a few
are caught. The diver does not confine
himself to the pearl oyster alone, but if
he sees a raro specimen of coral or a
new species of shell h3 places them in his
bag and sends them to the surface, where
they become the property of the conces
sion and one source of its large income.
Last year the value of the pearls har
vested in Lower California was alone
$350,000. In addition 5000 tons of shells
were exported, which were valued at
$1,250,000 more. Pearl-fishing is the entire
occupation of the natives, and La Paz, the
headauarters, a city of the peninsula, with
abou^ 2000 inhabitants, is solely dependent
upon the industry. The business is one
of chance, and the pursuit is a fascinating
ono to the natives, who are ail born
gamblers.
Every oyster does not contain its pearl
and only at intervals, and rare ones at
that, is a really valuable pearl discovered.
The largest one ever found was about
three-quarters of an inch in diameter and
was sold in Paris to the Emperor of
Austria for $10,000. Many black pearls
are found in Lower California and are
valued higher than the pure white. The
house than I do, senor," continued old
Rodrigo, after he had rolled a cigarette.
"Mv fatter he was killed in there and we
never found the murderer. Of course not.
It was the devil.
"But I have seen my father since, senor,
and he tell me to keep away from the old
house. He come out of his grave one
night to tell me. Oh, but I was fright
ened. I was going to run, but. he raised
his hand and I stop. I don't know what
words he say, but I don't go near the
house any more.

which grew gigantic oaks, from which the t
Indians gathered acorns to the fall to
make flour for winter. There, too, were !
pines bearing nuts, and up the slopes were
hazel-nuts and balsam?.
At the time of the sinking of the valley
a large band of Indians were camped
there, on ttie banks of a tiny creek, which
ran in and out of the Tuolumne River.
Acorns and nuts were plentiful, and they
had gathered enough to store their winter
wigwams in the foothills. They were lin
gering, almost ready to depart, when they
heard a rumbling and quaking of tho
earth beneath them. Paralyzed with fear,
they hesitated a moment, when a second
and heavier shocK threw them down.
With a mighty effort the tribe tried to
escape, crawline and running, but they
were doomed, all but three or four being
entombed.
There came a roar louder than cannon,

miles. At first it was presumed that the
Americans were in error, and some of
Uncle Sam's citizens built stores Close up
to the northern or British line at Bound

Town. At present no trace exists of ttie
place except the remains of some stone
chimneys. These storekeepers bought
their goods at Portland and The Dalles;
they would pay no duty to our customs,
and Judge Cox, then a British Commis
sioner for the district, could not enforce
the payment. That winter a Commis
sioner was appointed by each Govern
ment, and these officials met near Osoyoos
Lake some time in April, 1861. I was at
that time custom-bouae officer on the lake,
having receivea the appointment from
Governor Sir James Douglas earlier In the
year. I rode over frequently to see the
Commissioners. Their work to me seemed
to be done principally at night. Each
party had one astronomer. At the end of
six weeks their labor was completed, and
the decision then made was that the
Americans were right to a foot. The Brit
ish then commenced to pull down their
stone monuments, but they could not put
up the trees that were cut down lor a hun

their goods would not pay their bills. The
merchants applied to the Commissioner
to aid them in collecting the money, but
the Judge refused to have anything to do
about the matter, saying that they had
bought their goods in the United States
and had paid no duty thereon. The
miners gave as their reason for not
paying the bills the fact that the goods
that had been sold them were actnally
smuggled.
"Now were there two mistakes made or
did the British engineers first make the
mistake at Point Roberts and carry it
through for fully 200 miles? My belief is
that there' was only one mistake and that
was made at the starting-point, namely
Point Roberts, and that consequently the
whole boundary line is wrong clear
through from there to Osoyoos Lake.
"The British engineers claim that their
instruments got out of order at some in
tervening spot between Point Roberts and
Boundary Creek, but I think more likely
that the error was made at the starting
place. I fully believe that the boundary
line at the town of Blalne, now considered
in American territory, is in reality over
300 yards north of the 49th parallel.
It would be interesting to know whether,
on a proper resurvey, the United States
Government would return us that strip of
land or would they claim that thirty
years of peaceful possession gave them a
right to it?
"The American engineer who laid out
the town of Blame has openly stated to
me that most of it was in British terri

After interviewing Mr. Stevenson I vis

engineers and surveyors in Victoria, B. C,
and one of the oldest residents of British
.Marine Forest in the Gulf of California.
Canadian Border

Failed to .Meet
Columbia. Mr. Carey claims to have a
pei feet knowledge of all the circumstances
surrounding the work of the Boundary
line Commission, and he takes Issue em
phatically with Mr. Stevenson. Mr. Ca
rey's statements should have a great deal
of weight, as he himself was one of the
junior officials of the American side of the
commission and has a perfect recollection
of its work. After informing him of Mr.
Stevenson's statements and asking for an
expression of opinion for publication, he
said:
"In the first place, Mr. Stevenson is
wrong in his dates. In the year 1858 the
American Boundary Commission arrived
at Point. Roberts in charge of Commander
Campbell. The commander was accom
panied by Captain Parke, a graduate of
West Point, who was acting as chief as
tronomer, and Clint Garner of Washing
ton, D. C. The latter had just returned
from the South, where he had been the
head of a party surveying the Mexican
boundary. He was second astronomer to
the American Boundary Commission.
Under these gentlemen W as a corps of ex
cellent qualified surveyors, each man beine
thoroughly trained in his duty.
"The body stayed at Point Roberts for a
year and during the whole of that time
they worked at getting the central point
of the survey. At the end of the year the
British party arrived at Point Roberts,
accompanied by a body of royal engineers.
The party was headed by Colonel Hawkins,
Captain Haieh (chief astronomer), Cap
tain Darragb, Lieutenant (now General)
Plurumer and Lieutenant Wilson (now
Sir Charles Wilson of Soudan fame).
"I will tell you how the line was estab
lished. The astronomical observations by
which the American party, while waiting
for the Britishers, had established the
initial point were proved by Colonel
Hawkins to be correct, and then the
two parties started east from Point
Roberts.
"The American surveyors had the finest
instruments in the world. They were im
ported from Austria at great cost, and no
expense was spared in picking out the
best and most accurate. They were timed
to under half a second. The British sur
veyors had also magnificent instruments,
and in addition to this tha men of both
parties were probably the most intelligent
and capable in the world for carrying out

this class of work. They were the pick of
two nations.
"As the parties moved along on either
side they camped at every eight miles
during the course and each body at once
proceeded to define the spot through
which the line would pass. This opera
tion took from four to six weeks, neither
party approaching the other till the calcu
lations of both were completed. Then
notes were compared and a spot fixed on,
when the parties moved on another eight
miles, where the observations were re
peated. The manner in which these ob
servationi were carried out shows how
particular both bodies were to locate the
line accurately without any chancj of de
viation one way or the other.
"Before any wort was done a tree was
cut down within four feet of the ground
and the largtr instruments were securely
fixed to the stump in order to make them
perfectly stationary and under no earth
action whatever. The camps were built
in a semicircle around these instruments
and the night observations were carried on
with the greatest care and attention.
Then when the point between the two
campj was finally decided on, a stone
monument was placed over this spot.
"Aud this procedure was followed out
right to the Columbia River, and I believe
throughout the whole survey. The boun
dary as defined at present is, I firmly be
lieve, perfectly correct. There has never
been any evidence to shaka the truth of
the survey from the day it was made until
now, and knowing as I do the status of tho
men who carried it out, and the very great
care exercised with such unceasing vigi
lance all through the expedition, it ia in
credible that a mistake should have been
made."
With two such statements as these,
diametrically opposed to one another, it
is difficult, without being able to retrace
the survey step by step, to obtain any nc
curate knowledge of the subject. But the
weight of reasoning seems to lie with Mr.
Carey's opinions. It is indeed incredible,
as he states", that men who were selected
by both the British and American Gov
ernments on account of their peculiar fit
ness for the work of running the survey
should have made such an unaccountable
mistake as has been over and over again
charged up against them.

The dramatic outlook is cleverly de
scribed in a dialogue between a critic and a
dramatist published in the St. James Ga
zette. "Daring ali these years," says the
critic reproachfully to the dramatist,
"you fellows have been led on to play ex
clusiTely upon the intellect of audiences.
Well, one fine day, as might have been
anticipated, It suddenly collapsed, and up
sprang the emotions with, 'Now, it's our
turn."'
From New York and Boston, London
and Paris the same new? comes. Emo
tion and romance are to rule the roost in
the new dramatic productions, and the
back parlor immorality of Ibsen and Su
dermann, and the vice and water of
Pinero, and the other English dramatists
who have followed timidly and talkily in
iheir footsteps, are all to be cleaned out
and the sunlighi of healthy, honest senti
ment is to be let in once more. Adieu
"Second Mrs. Tanqueray," farewell "Re-
Del'ious Susan."' The lady with a "past"
and the wife with "new" views are dead as
a door nail, and the sweet young thing
who wants to give her hand where she
eives her heart is to be all the "go" in
dramatic circles this winter.
Many people say the success of "The
Prisoner of Zenda" last season had a great
deal to do with the routing out of the
problem play, but I think there is a nat
ural reaction against the presence of small
talk and the absence of movement, which
have characterized the dramas produced
during the last few years. Anyway, the
success of the dawning season, both in
America and England, promises to be
"The Two Little Vagabonds,' 1 adopted
from the French of "Les Deux Gosses."
It contains more sentiment than "East
Lynne" and the "Two Orphans" rolled
into one, and hardened first-nighters and
blase critics manfully confess that they
hnve moistened handkerchiefs over it.
"The Two Little Vagabonds" received its
first American production in the hub of
the universe a couple of weeks ago, and
brainy Boston bedewed it with the tribu

Talkinpr of weeping in the theater,

California manhood blowing their noses ,
with unnecessary violence just at the time

could reconcile me to that impossible
specimen of saintly childhood it would be
little Mildred's impersonation of Eva.
Most precocious infants make Eva a pe
dantic little prig, but Mildred was pa
thetically natural and childlike, and she
looked frail and ethereal enough to be an
angel herself, if angels are characterized
by consumptive tendencies.
I made it a duty â and a pleasure â to see
a performance of "The Wife's P< ril" at
the Alcazar last weefc. Francis Powers
was the young man who introduced the
peril element, and he played the part of |
the would-be desecrator of the Winthrops'
domestic hearth with guilt stamped upon
his brow. If the husband had been even
more guilelessly unsuspicious than he
was, and had no "unselfish" friends to
open his eyes, Powers' guilty hang-dog
look ought to have assured him that all
was not well. He was a

as they say in "Patier.ce," and toe looked
soulful enough to satisfy even Mrs. Ger

I have no confidence in soulful men my
self. They may pretend that they dine off
a lily and sup off a dewdrop, but I would
not imperil the safety of an oyster-supper
by leaving it alone with one of them.
Powers looked just the sort of soulful
young man that it would be well to keep
an eye on.
John T. Snllivan and J. B. Polk gave
clever character studies of that good fel

DUt they were too fond of the part of the
stage where the prompter's still small
voice can best be heard. I was flabagat
tered to see them continually tacking
toward the prompt side, because one never
suspects actors of their ability of having a
speaking acquaintance with the prompter.
Carl Smith, as Major Dolittle, knew his
lines and acted with refreshing vigor.
His makeup was perfect, and the brutal
ag-Tessiyeness of his walk and the arro
gant way in which he out his hands into
his pockets never failed to bring down
a laugh at the touching phrase, "I wish
I was selfish." Theodore, his son, j
who tortured the major's heart and his I

doing very nicely indeed and the plays
are most artistically staged.
There was a gathering of the clans of
light-opera lovers at the Tivoli on Mon
day night which gave conclusive proof of
Hartroan's popularity as a comedian.
The jovial Ferris was quite unknown to
fame as an extravaganza writer, but his
friends were anxious to sample his first
attempt and went prepared to judge his
work leniently. To say that they were
surprised at his offering would be putting
it milaly. The best proof of their feelinus
is afforded by the fact that they went
again the next night and took their
friends. Ever since if you want a good
seat at the Tivoli you must book it ahead,
or you may perchance have to stand.

The stagehands at the Grand say that
the most blood-curdling melodrama Man
ager Morosco can put on will henceforth
appear tame and uneventful to them, com
pared to their own personal experiences
last Monday night. The excitement came
about through indulgence in politics, and
it happened in this wise: Manager Mor
osco had hired a couple of bloodhounds to
do a turn in "Uncle Tom'c Cabin," and it
was understood that the owner of the
noble animals should be on hand to aid
and advise them in case they suffered from
stage fright.
At rehearsal the canines tracked a sau
sage concealed in Mr. Siockweil's um
brella with an intelligence and skill which
raised the highest expectations for their
success. Monday night came and with ii
the dogs, but not their owner nor their
owner's wife. It was understood that the
gentleman could not tear himself away
from a political meeting, which claimed
bis attention, and that his wi;e ha i to
attend a gathering of lady suffragists.
The doggies were accompanied by a young
woman, who frankly confessed that she
had not the least control over them, and
the stagehands soon found to their sorrow
that she spoke but too truly.
At first the behavior of the dogs was
most exemplary, out anon they chafed at
having to wait for their turn, and com
menced prowling about the vasty regions
behind the Grand Opera-house stage.
Now. Mr. fctockwell had left the um
brella containing 'he suusage in the prop
erty man's charge, and unerring instinct
led the bloodhounds to track the succu
lent morsel to its lair. They both fell
upon it at once, and, as botn could not
cie your it simultaneously, came to growls,
t ben to blows and finally broke into a
tight which, for earnestness of purpose
and stern determination to conquer, could
have given pointers to Pompadour Jim
and Sailor-boy SharKey. The stage
hands were terrified lest the din of battle
should penetrate to the ears of the audi
ence, and yet each realized that it was as
much as his life was worth to attempt to
separate the combatants.
That figi.t was the reason why two
limp and mangled bloodhounds "disap
j pointed" tne audience on Monday night,
and why the stagehands have acquired a
superstitious dread of letting even a yel
low dog put his nose behind the scenes at
the Grand.
Gustav Walter swells with justifiable
pride and joy whenever he beholds the
painting and decorating and frescoing
which have lately been done at the
Orpheum, but his special delight is in the
new entrance doors â heavy, highly var
nished doors that contain sheets of beauti
ful looking-glass, which are tenderly pol
ished every morning.
Not long ago Manager Walter was in his
counting-house engaged, like the king of
the nursery rhyme, in counting out his
money, when one of his myrmidons
rushed breathlessly in to say that the
gallery boys were becoming impatient at
not being able to get in all at once and
that some of ihe disappointed ones were
kicking at the varnished doors.
"Ach, Gott in Himmel!" cried Walter.
"My new doors?"
"Yes, your new doors," replied the
myrmidon, whose words were corroborated
by sounds of dull, sickening thuds coming
from the entrance.
Manager Walter is a man of action. He
tarried only to lock up his money a:id
then rushed to the entrance and threw
himself with Napoleonic strategy in front
of his cherished doors, crying, "Gentle

don't get in for half an hour."

Florence Bindley, a musical comedienne,
opens to-morrow evening in her own play,
"The Pay Train," which she describes as
a "realistic comedy drama." "The Pay

heroine' s grandfather by the villain. The
action of the play then reveals plot and
counterplot, as the villain weaves only to
have his plans unraveled by the daring
heroine, who eventually wins her father's
liberty and happiness.
As the play progresses the heroine frus

show here. Some of last week's favorites
also remain.
J\t the Chutes.
During the past week much interest has
been taken by local wheelmen in the
thirty-five mile relay race at the Chutes,
between the C. C. and S. F. C. ciubs. The
race finishes this afternoon, and at the
termination the trophy cup will be given
to the wining club.
Pirri, the demon cyclist, has been
"chutinc" nightly, and makes two trips
to-day, afternoon and evening. Professor
Frank Miller, the aeronaut, makes a
balloon ascension and parachute drop this
afternoon at 4:30. The casino will shortly
be turned into a roller rink.
Lasaux Bervefit.
A grand testimonial benefit will be
tendered to Harry E. de Lasaux by the
different ciubs and societies of this City,
and by his friends, at Native Sons' Hall,
an the 26th inst. Mr. Lasaux has played
as an amateur in this City for twelve
years. An interesting programme haÂ»
been arranged for his benefit.
Where They y\lWavjs Laugh.
There is always some point in a play
which the actors find by experience will
bring a laugh from the house at every per
formance. The lollowini' is when the
loudest laugh comes in at some of last and
this week's plays:
"Prisoner of Zenda":
Young Rudolph Rassendyll aided by
Colonel Sapl and young Fritz is imperson
ating the King. Black Michael and
Madame de Mauban have discovered the
plot and threa>en exposure. Rudolpn and
his two colleagues are in a dilemma and
the following dialogue is one that never
fails to bring forth a round of laughter
from the audience:
Colonel Sapt â There is only onÂ« way
out of it.
Rudolphâ And that isâ
Colonel Sapt â To stay in it.
"The Ugly Duckline":
Professor Graydon (aside to Mr. Ganby)
â Your wife is radiant to-night, you know.
She reminds me of a morning glory.
Mr. Ganby â I wish she were one.
Professor Gravdonâ Why?
Mr. Gandyâ Because she'd shut up at
ni_ht.
"Uncle Tom's Cabin":
A calchy but almost forgotten slang
phrase is brought to mind as Phineas
Fletcher sadly pronounces: "Woe unto
him who committeth offense 1 Woe unto
the evil-doer who repenteth notl \Voe
unto him who committeth persecution!
Wh-o-a Emma!"
Riley and Hughes, the black-face team
at the Orpheum, spring a "'gag" that
brings down the house. In telling it they
always change the day of the week. Fora '
Sunday evening audience the "gag" would
be repeated as follows:
Wliich is proper, to-morrow is Tuesday,
or to-morrow will be Tuesday?"
"Oh, dats easy. Why, to-morrow will
De Tuesday, of course. Ask me something
hard."
"You lose."
"How's dat?"
"To-morrow will be Monday. My
honey."'
What Is "Trilby's" Charm?
Dv Maorier says that he was killed by
the success of "Trilby." It is interesting to
know just wherein this success lies and
the following are the opinions of a few
men, whose business it is to know a good
play wnen they see it. Strange to say, no
two of them agree.
Manatrer Friedlander â When I first read
the story of "Trilby" I must confess I
never could see a play in it, therefore I
must give Paul Potter full credit for hay-

ing made from Dv Maurier's famous book
a stage entertainment that will live be
yond the lite of any ordinary fad.
Manager Moroseo â I consider the credit
for the success of "Trilby" as a play is
due to Dv Maurier, for however cleverly
Paul Potter dramatized it. tne fact re
mains that he would not have bad any
thing to dramatize if th<* novel ha ! not
been written. The pictures of the Latin
quarter are the charm of the play.
Manager Belascoâ The thorough Bohe
mian element in "Trilby" and its truth to
nature have made it one of the most suc
cessful plays produced during the last
three years. The character drawing is due
to Dv Maurier, but credit must be given to
Paul Potter, for the dramatist has to tell
in a few words what the novelist can take
pages to describe. _
A. J. Mooreâ The success of "Trilby"
with the masses is due to its mystery.
The majority of people know little or noth
ing of hypnotism and they are fascinated
by the unknown. It is interesting for
the insight it jiives into life in the Latin
quarter, but otherwise I do not think
"Trilby" has any particular literary value.
W. H. Leahyâ The whole idea of "Tril
by always Â«eemed to me weird, grew
some and unnatural. I acknowledge that
as a play it is very effective, but the whole
NEW TO-DAYâ AMUSEMENTS.
story is too unnatural to give me any
pleasure.
Fernando Michelena-Ifs' a perfectly
possible and natural idea to make a per- â¢
son with no ear sing under the influenca y
of hypnotism, if the organs are there.
Hypnotism is a mental suggestion, ana n .
woman without a voice could not Bin KÂ»
however much she was hypnotized, but
supposing tuat the line organs were there,
and a musician hypnotized her, it is quite
reasonable to suppose that she could sin,;,
under his mental suggestion.
And such is fame â no two people can
agree wherein it lies.
Dramatic Brevities.
Maude Adams becomes a star at the head of
her own company under the direction ol
Charles Frohman next September.
The five wicked little Harrison sisters are ap
parently not naughty enough to make any
proiound impression in N. w York.
On November 5 the Columbia Theater School
oi Dramatic Art will give its next entertain
ment at ihe Commbia Theater, when some new
plays by local authors Â« 111 be presented.
Miss Anna Daly's many friends tendered her
a farewell concert on Thursday evening,
which in alljespects was very successlul. The
ehii-f item was the comedietta oi "The Happy
Pair," in which Hiss Daly very successfully
portrayed a bride's idea of matrimonial hap
piness, while Dr. Frank Robinson was equu ly
clever in showing the obverse side ol the

Explanation.
The arrow files with the wind. Thetopflgnre*
at station indicate maximum temperature for the
days; those underneath it, if any, the am oil nt of
rainfall, of melted snow In inches and hundredth*.
during the past twelve hours.. Isobars, or solid
lines, connect pom s of equal air pressure; iso
therms, or dotted lines, equal temperature, The
word "hieh" means high barometric pressure and
is usually accompanied by fair weather: "low"
refers to low pressure, and is usually preceded
and accompanied by cloudy weather and rains.
"Lows" us; ally first appear on the Washington
coast. When the pressure is high in thÂ« Interior
and low along the coast, and the isobars extend
north and south along the coast, rain is probable;
but when the "low" Is inclosed with isobars of
- marked curvature, rain south of Oregon Is improb
- able. With a "high" in the vicinity of Idaho, and
the pressure falling to the California coa* r . warmer
weather may be expected in summer and colder
weather In winter. The reverse of these conditions
will produce an opposite result.

bacco made a sensational break of 7% per cent to
691.4 on dealings of 31.300 shares and this was
the only feature of trading: at the stock Exchange
to-day. Tbe transactions outside of tobacco aggre
gated only 61,896 shares. The slump in the
specialties was due to liquidations by a pool which
had acquired a line of stock on the belief tha: a
deal with the company's principal competitors In
the West could be brought to a successful con
clusion. It was given out that the negotiators
Â«â - were unable .to agree and a rash to sell imme
diately followed. Other leading Issues were not
influenced by the remarkable decline in the stock
named.
The railway Hat held -â  firm and in some cases ad
vances were made daring the first hour of busi
ness. - The bank ement, however, chilled the
bullish feeling. and near the close the entire list
was lower. The exhibit was unfavorable to a de
gree. It showed a co traction in loans, a heavy
loss in legal tenders and deposits and a moderate
fain in specie. The statement refit cts tbe hoard
ing of money and the shipment of currency to in
terior points.
In the late reaction Sugar, Manhattan, the
Granger*, Louisville and Nashville, Leather pre
ferred and Reading led. The decline was equal to
V4@iys percent.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, 111.. Oct. 17.â The opening of the
wheat market was attended by wild excitement
thi> morning, with trading j extending over a half
cent range and at prices trom 13/s" to I % c higher
than yesterday's close. Following the advance
mentioned the market ascended by leaps until it
showed 2Â»4c gain, when it seemed to meet with
enough realizing to check the rise. Liverpool

WHEAT AND OTHJEK GRAINS.
, WHEATâ Not for a great many years has .such
a boom struck the Wheat market of California.
The cause is simpleâ the almost complete failure
of the Indian crop. Cables yesterday reported it
practically destroyed for next year. The Austra
lian crop was also reported in a bad way, owing to
dry weather. These advices set the Wheat trade
In Europe and America wild and the r. suit was
an advance that took operators' breath away. Half
the dea era on : 'Change were unab c to even guess
what vv beat was worth. Actual sa cs, however,
were a: $1 37Vs<$l 45 for fair -to choice snipping
and milling and $1 ?o@l 35 for lower grades.
This advance ought to be sharp enough to suit
anybody. At the close all good Wheat was held at
*1 50. -

McKINLEY WILL
CARRY OREGON
Such, at Least, Is the Opin
ion of Lydell Baker
of Portland.
Says the State Is Safe Because
the Silver Sentiment Is
Dying Out
FARMERS WANT PROTECTION.
Gold Democrats Bolt Orator Bryan
and Are Flocking to the St.
Louis Platform.
Lydell Baker, one of the most promi
nent attorneys of Portland, Or., and a
power in State party politics, is at the
Grand Hotel. He says that the silver
craze is rapidly dying out in Oregon and
is confident that McKiniey and Hobart
will carry the State by a big maj >rity.
"There is no doubt that the silver senti
ment at one time assumed alarming pro
portions in Oregon and threatened to
sweep the State," said Mr. Baker last
night. "It is not so now. The straddiers
have been forced off the fence and have
climbed on to the St. Louis platform with
both feet. At the June election held for
State offices and members of Congress the
Republican party w.js sadly divided. Two
years before Mr. Dolph, who was perhaps
the ablest representative Oregon has had
LYDELL BAKER, Who Predicts
That McKinley Will Carry Ore
gon by a Rousing Majority.
in Congress in recent years, was beaten in
the contest for his seat in the Senate be
cause he was opposed to the free coinage
of silver except under international agree
ment. Then the contest between gold
bugs end silver cranks began.
"Mr. Herman, who had been in the
lower house of Congress for twelve years,
was beaten for renomination because he
was in favor of unconditional free coin
aee, and in the Portland district at tne
June election the gold Republicans, as
they were called, but who iti reality were
international agreement silver men, re
fused to support the re uiar Republican
nominee because he had voted for the
Senate free-coinage substitute to the Re
publican tariff measure of last winter.
They put up an independent candidate,
Judge Northup, who surprised every
body by the large vote which he received.
I myself supported Jud^e Northup and
spoKe in his behalf, and under similar cir
cumstances would do so again, because he
stood on the National Republican plat
form, and the regular nominee did not.
"But the inexorable and unequivocal
declarations of the St. Louis platform
have checked the silver craze in our State,
thrown it back on the defensive, and no
where ia Bryan losing ground more rap
idly than in Oregon.
"la the first place, the traveling man â
the much abused drummer â is doing us a
great deal of good. I travel a great deal
on the train, and everywhere I find him
a. ways ready for an argument on the
money question, and remarkably well
posted from a business standpoint.
"At a meeting in one of the little towns
X saw six farmers who had changed within
three weeks, and this is indicative of the
landslide which is going on all over the
State. Palmer is going to get very few
votes in our State. The gold Democrats
are coming to us in a boay, and they con
stitute the brains, tne character and the
ability of the party.
"As another indication," continued Mr.
Baker, "of the way things are changing, I
mignt refer to the crowds which gather on
the streets of Portland arguing the money
question. Tney are composed mostly of
workingmen. Two week* ago a man who
opposed the election of Bryan could not
speak without having men on all sides
putting questions to vim, and often in a
very bilter and sarcastic tone of voice. To
day there is a marked change. The Mc-
Kinley men are the aggressive ones. It is
beginning to dawn upon the workingmen
tnat the free coinage of silver would drive
the cold out of the country, and this they
don't want."
When asked about the betting, Mr.
Baker said it was in favor of McKiniey.
"I know of one bet," he added, "oi $1000
to $600 that McKiniey would carry Oregon.
I myself feel absolutely sure that the
State will go Republican. The people are
not now and never have been repudia
tionists or revolutionists, and all that is
necessary is for the issues of the campaign
to be presented squarely to them to have
an old-time rousing Republican majority."
Mr. Baker formerly lived in San Fran
cisco, and is a graduate of Hastings Col
lege. He is an eloquent speaker, and old
campaigners will remember his efforts for
the Republican party during B.aine's can
didacy. He is prominent in Oregon
politics and was defeated for the Re
publican nomination for Attorney-General
by seven votes. Mr. Baker is a nephew of
Colonel E. D. Baker, whose name has
gone down in history as one of the most
eloquent men the Republic has ever pro
duced. -

TRANSFER TICKETS.
Judge Campbell Decides That It Is a
Misdemeanor for a Passenger to
tilve One Away.
Jules Formel, the young electrician who
was arrested Friday night at Powell and
Market streets by A. Iratt and L. Krouse,
two "spotters" of the Market-street Cable
Company, for violating the transfer ordi-
REV. J. GEORGE GIBSON, DO,
Pastor*
nance, appeared before Judge Campbell
yesterday morning.
Formel received a transfer from the con
ductor of a Powell- treet car and in place
of using it handed it to a boy who was
standing on the corner. Pratt and Krouse
observed him and Erouse seized him and
placed him under arrest Pratt grabbed
hold of Henry Lefooitz, a newsboy, who
resisted arrest and a riot was nearly pre
cipitated, the crowd that soon gath
ered taking sides with Forme! and the
newsboy.
After the two "spotters" had given their
evidence Attorney Kelly, who appeared
for the company, cited the section of the
rec-nt ordinance which makes it a misde
meanor to dispose of a transfer ticket, and
the section of the code which authorizes
the exercise of the police power of a mu
nicipal corporation to srive full effect to
any and all franchises granted by the cor
poration.
The Judge ordered Formel to appear for
sentence to-morrow. It is said an appeal will
be taken to determine whether or not a
passenger has any property rights in a
transfer issued to him for a money con
sideration.

ARE AGAINST M'KINLEY.
England Dislikes Him Because
He Is in Favor of
the Tariff.
S. C Lillis on the Feeling of Capital
istsâThe Poor Hotels of
London
8. C. Li His, the capitalist of this city,
who is largely interested in the Bank of
Hanford, Bank of Oroville and Bank of
Lemoore, returned here yesterday after
one hundred days in England and Scot
land. Mr. Lillis for a long time owned a
good part of the great Laguna de Tacbe
Rancho in Fresno, King and Kern coun
ties. He has bÂ«*en in his time an exten
sive railroad contractor, and has dipped
into other things. He went over to Lon
don on an important business matter, and
was successful in his purposes.
But he says, nevertheless, that money is
very close in England. If a man wants
money, generally speaking, he can get it
far easier in the United States than there.
They don't want to invest in anything in
America, and won't do so till after the
election.
"They appear over there not to like this
country in the slightest way," he said,
"and politically tney think we are all
going to the dogs. They hate McKiniey
because of the tariff and they don't like
Bryan on account of free silver. Of the
two, thougn, I rather think they hate
McKiniey tne most. The financial articles
in the papers are full of the grossest mis
statements â lies, pure and simple â full of
things that any American knows are lies.
I asked some of the editors why they pub
lished them and they could give no reason
for it.
"I have been over there many times,
and each time I like the country less than
formerly. I spent most of my time in
London, and do my best I couldn't get
anything tit to eat. I went all around,
and tried first one place and then another,
till the whole gamut of hotels and
restaurants of any note had been run.
"The beefsteaks were tough, dry and
tasteless. Their chicken was cooked with
ham." It was tough business everywhere.
The bricklayer in this country lives better
than the Prince of Wi.cs, and not a man
in England lives as well as the well-to-do
man in this country.
"This is iv the rough about the way
things stand. I had to c me home to get
a good meal. If I look poor :t is attrib
utable to the wretched London hotels.
Every guest goes by a number there.
"They don't know a man's name and
glory in the fact that they don't, and treat
him uncivilly while taking his cash. I
may say, as a whole yon can get more for
a penny and less for a pound there than
any place on earth.
"But despite their distrust of all things
American McKiniey is going to be elected.
He is if indications in the East count for
anything. I stopped for some time in
Chicago. McKiniey will carry that State
by a tremendous majority. Altgeid will
not be eiected. This is the concensus of
opinion there."
The Moody Quartet Will Sing To-Day.

How Oriental! Calls up Arabia and

"Mohammed" Coffee Is on ; the table of
Turkey's 8u I tan. Ha Raises It Himself.
The product of his immense plantation
was not permitted to be exported until
three years ago. Since then it has become
a great favorite among Europeans with a
cultivated palate. It is generally conceded
that it excels all other coffees in the mar-
ket for ; a certain fine and delicate flavor
that users of common coffees , have ' no
